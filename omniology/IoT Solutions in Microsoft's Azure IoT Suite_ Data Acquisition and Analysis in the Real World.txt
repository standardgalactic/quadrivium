Introduction      1
Introduction
I 
discovered financial modeling in Microsoft Excel when I worked in investment 
banking in London (as most young Aussies do). Back then, it wasn’t even called 
“financial modeling,” but I was hooked. Since those days, I’ve devoted my 
entire career to working in Excel and building models for the purpose of business 
cases, reports, budgets, and dashboards. I’ve worked with hundreds of clients in 
many different countries to help build their models for them or train them on how 
to build their own. Financial modeling in Excel takes me all over the world and I 
hope that it brings you the same fun and excitement!
About This Book
I wrote this book based on the experiences I’ve had with the many insightful 
people I’ve trained or worked with over the years. I cover the tools and techniques 
that are the most commonly needed for building models. This book is aimed at 
people who have a good smattering of Excel knowledge but want to improve their 
skills to perform better in their current roles or to get better jobs.
After reading this book, you’ll know exactly what a financial modeler does and 
how to apply the principles of financial modeling to your work. You may not call 
yourself a “career” financial modeler. Instead, you might think of yourself as a 
“casual” modeler — maybe it’s a side interest for you, or it’s just one part of your 
job. But after reading this book, you may be bitten by the modeling bug and want 
to pursue a full-time career in this field!
You don’t have to read this book from cover to cover — feel free to jump around 
and read the sections that are of most interest to you! In most cases, I demon-
strate the tools and techniques covered by applying them to a simple model — 
usually what I would expect to be just part of a full financial model. In Part 3, you 
create three full financial models from start to finish. I encourage you to read this 
book with Excel open and not too far away because you’ll want to try out many of 
the exercises and techniques described in these pages.

Foolish Assumptions
I assume just a few basic things about you. It goes without saying that you’re 
highly intelligent because you recognize the value of having financial modeling 
skills. But I also assume that you have the following:
»
» A PC with a relatively recent version of Excel installed: The screenshots 
and instructions in this book relate to Microsoft Excel 2016 and its capabilities. 
If you’re using a Mac, or a previous version of Excel, you might find some of 
the instructions slightly different, but you should be able to find your 
way around.
»
» A working knowledge of Excel and a use for it: I don’t assume that you’re 
an Excel expert, but you should at least know your way around and perhaps 
have created at least a few basic calculations before.
»
» Some kind of financial background: You know what a set of financial 
statements looks like, you know what revenue is, and you know how interest 
calculations work. Some of the complexities are explained in this book, but I 
assume that these kinds of basic financial concepts are not entirely new to you.
Icons Used in This Book
This book is jam-packed with tips, tricks, warning, and ways to work smarter, 
faster, and more accurately.
Anything marked with the Tip icon will make your financial modeling quicker or 
easier.
If I mark it with the Remember icon, it’s really, really important and you should 
pay special attention.
When you see the Warning icon, you know that I’m trying to save you the pain and 
agony of making a mistake (one that I’ve probably made many times myself).
I get very excited when talking or writing about financial modeling, so sometimes 
I get a little technical on you. Anything marked with the Technical Stuff icon isn’t 
essential to your understanding of the surrounding text.

Introducing Financial 
Modeling
T
he demand for financial modeling skills has increased exponentially in 
recent years and many job listings for finance positions now include “finan-
cial modeling” as a core skill. If you’re reading this book, you’ve probably 
already discovered how important this skill is, and you know that learning finan-
cial modeling will increase your employability in finance or financially focused 
fields.
In this chapter, I define financial modeling — what it is, who uses it, and why it 
matters. I also show you some examples of financial models. If you’re brand-new 
to financial modeling, this chapter is a very good place to start.
Defining Financial Modeling
Before you dive into how to use Microsoft Excel to create financial models, you 
need to know what financial modeling is, who uses financial models, and why 
financial modeling matters. In this section, I fill you in.
Chapter 1

8      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
What it is
When I teach a course on basic financial modeling, I always ask my students for 
their definitions of the term financial model. Most of them come up with long-
winded descriptions using terms like forecast and cash flow and hypothetical out-
comes. But I don’t think the definition needs to be that complicated. A financial 
model is a tool (typically built in Excel) that displays possible solutions to a real-
world financial problem. And financial modeling is the task of creating a financial 
model.
You may have thought that a financial model was basically just an Excel spread-
sheet, but as you know, not every spreadsheet is a financial model. People can and 
do use Excel for all kinds of purposes. So, what makes a financial model distinct 
from a garden-variety spreadsheet? In contrast to a basic spreadsheet, a financial 
model
»
» Is more structured. A financial model contains a set of variable assumptions — 
inputs, outputs, calculations, and scenarios. It often includes a set of standard 
financial forecasts — such as a profit-and-loss statement, a balance sheet, and a 
cash flow statement — which are based on those assumptions.
»
» Is dynamic. A financial model contains inputs that, when changed, impact the 
calculations and, therefore, the results. A financial model always has built-in 
flexibility to display different outcomes or final calculations based on changing 
a few key inputs.
»
» Uses relationships between several variables. When the user changes any 
of the input assumptions, a chain reaction often occurs. For example, chang-
ing the growth rate will change the sales volume; when the sales volume 
changes, the revenue, sales commissions, and other variable expenses will 
change.
»
» Shows forecasts. Financial models are almost always looking into the future. 
Financial modelers often want to know what their financial projections will 
look like down the road. For example, if you continue growing at the same 
rate, what will your cash flow be in five years?
»
» Contains scenarios (hypothetical outcomes). Because a model is looking 
forward instead of backward, a well-built financial model can be easily used to 
perform scenario and sensitivity analysis. What would happen if interest rates 
went up? How much can we discount before we start making a loss?
More broadly, a financial model is a structure (usually in Excel) that contains 
inputs and outputs, and is flexible and dynamic.

CHAPTER 1  Introducing Financial Modeling      9
Who uses it
Many types of people build and use financial models for different purposes and 
goals. Financial models are usually built to solve real-world problems, and there 
are as many different financial models as there are real-world problems to solve. 
Generally, anyone who uses Excel for the purpose of finance will at some point in 
his career build a financial model for himself or others to use; at the very least, 
he’ll use a model someone else created.
Bankers, particularly investment bankers, are heavy users of financial models. 
Due to the very nature of financial institutions, modeling is part of the culture of 
the company — the business’s core is built on financial models. Banks and finan-
cial institutions must comply with current regulatory restrictions, and the tools 
and controls in place are forever changing and adapting. Because of the risk asso-
ciated with lending and other financial activities, these institutions have very 
complex financial modeling systems in place to ensure that the risk is managed 
effectively. Anyone working in the banking industry should have at least a work-
ing knowledge of spreadsheets and financial models.
Outside the banking industry, accountants are big users of financial models. 
Bankers are often evaluating other companies for credit risk and other measures. 
An accountant’s models, however, are often more inward looking, focusing  
on internal operations reporting and analysis, project evaluation, pricing, and 
profitability.
Why it matters
A financial model is designed to depict a real-life situation in numbers in order to 
help people make better financial decisions.
Wherever there are financial problems or situations in the real world that need 
solving, analyzing, or translating into a numerical format, financial models help. 
Sometimes it’s just an idea or a concept that needs to be converted into a business 
case or feasibility proposal. A skilled financial modeler can put substance to the 
idea by augmenting the details enough to get a working model upon which deci-
sions can be made, investor funds can be gained, or staff can be hired.
For example, financial models can help investors decide which project to put their 
money into, an executive track which marketing campaigns have the highest 
return on investment, or a factory production manager decide whether to pur-
chase a new piece of machinery.

10      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Looking at Examples of Financial Models
When you then consider the benefits that a financial model can bring, it’s difficult 
not to get carried away thinking of the application potential of a financial model! 
When you understand the principles of financial models, you can begin to look at 
the most common scenarios in which a model would be implemented.
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A FINANCIAL 
MODELER
Someone working with financial models typically has an undergraduate degree in busi-
ness, finance, or commerce. Additionally, she likely has at least one of the following 
postgraduate qualifications:
•	 An accountancy qualification, such as CA (Certified Accountant), CPA (Certified 
Public Accountant), CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants), ACCA 
(Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), CMA (Certified Management 
Accountant), or CIA (Certified Internal Auditor)
•	 A Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree
•	 A Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation
•	 A Financial Risk Manager (FRM) designation
Of course, you don’t need all those letters after your name to build and work with finan-
cial models. I know many skilled modelers who come from backgrounds in IT or engi-
neering, or who don’t have any formal qualifications at all. Currently, there is no specific 
certification qualification for financial modeling professionals — at least nothing that is 
publically recognized — but I expect this might change in the near future. You can find 
courses in financial modeling, however. For example, I run a five-day Certificate in 
Financial Modeling Using Excel course through George Washington University several 
times a year in Dubai. And I have colleagues who run similar programs. I would classify 
these kinds of program as short-course vocational training rather than full certification.
If you simply want to list financial modeling as a skill on your résumé, a short course is 
sufficient (backed up by at least a couple of models you’ve built in the real world). If 
you’re aiming toward a financial modeling career, you’ll need formal finance qualifica-
tions such as those listed here, as well as intense, practical, hands-on work experience.

CHAPTER 1  Introducing Financial Modeling      11
There are a variety of categories of financial models:
»
» Project finance models: When a large infrastructure project is being 
assessed for viability, the project finance model helps determine the capital 
and structure of the project.
»
» Pricing models: These models are built for the purpose of determining the 
price that can or should be charged for a product.
»
» Integrated financial statement models (also known as a three-way 
financial model): The purpose of this kind of model is to forecast the 
financial position of the company as a whole.
»
» Valuation models: Valuation models value assets or businesses for the 
purpose of joint ventures, refinancing, contract bids, acquisitions, or other 
kinds of transactions or “deals.” (The people who build these kinds of models 
are often known as deals modelers.)
»
» Reporting models: These models summarize the history of revenue, 
expenses, or financial statements (such as the income statement, cash flow 
statement, or balance sheet).
Modelers generally specialize in one or two of these model categories. You’ll see 
some overlap between each type of model category, but most models can be clas-
sified as one model type.
In this section, I show you some examples of scenarios and places in which these 
categories of financial models can come in handy, along with the functions and 
characteristics of each.
Project finance models
Loans and the associated debt repayments are an important part of project finance 
models, because these projects are normally long term, and lenders need to know 
whether the project is able to produce enough cash to service the debt. Metrics 
such as debt service cover ratio (DSCR) are included in the model and can be used 
as a measure of risk of the project, which may affect the interest rate offered by 
the lender. At the beginning of the project, the DSCR and other metrics are agreed 
upon between the lender and borrower such that the ratio must not go below a 
certain number.
Pricing models
The input to a pricing model is the price, and the output is the profitability. To 
create a pricing model, an income statement (or profit-and-loss statement) of the 

12      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
business or product should be created first, based on the current price or a price 
that has been input as a placeholder. At a very high level:
Units × Price = Revenue
Revenue – Expenses = Profit
Of course, this kind of model can be very complex and involve many different tabs 
and calculations, or it can be quite simple, on a single page. When this structure 
model is in place, the modeler can perform sensitivity analysis on the price entered 
using a goal seek (see Chapter 7) or a data table (see Chapter 8).
Integrated financial statement models
Not every financial model needs to contain all three types of financial statements, 
but many of them do, and those that do are known as integrated financial state-
ment models. You may also hear them referred to as “three-way financial mod-
els.” The three types of financial statements included in an integrated financial 
statement model are the following:
»
» Income statement, also known as a profit-and-loss (P&L) statement
»
» Cash flow statement
»
» Balance sheet
From a financial modeling perspective, it’s very important that when an inte-
grated financial statement model is built, the financial statements are linked 
together properly so that if one statement changes, the others change as well. For 
an example of how to build an integrated financial statement model, turn to 
Chapter 12.
Valuation models
Building valuation models requires a specialized knowledge of valuation theory 
(using the different techniques of valuing an asset), as well as modeling skills. If 
you’re a casual financial modeler, you probably won’t be required to create from 
scratch a fully functioning valuation model. But you should at least have an idea 
of what types of valuation financial models are out there.
Here are three common types of valuation financial models you may encounter:

CHAPTER 1  Introducing Financial Modeling      13
»
» Mergers and acquisitions (M&A): These models are built to simulate the 
effect of two companies merging or one company taking over the other. M&A 
models are normally undertaken in a tightly controlled environment. Due to 
its confidential nature, an M&A model has fewer players than other kinds of 
models. The project moves quickly because time frames are tight. The few 
modelers working on an M&A model do so in a concentrated period of time, 
often working long hours to achieve a complex and detailed model.
»
» Leveraged buyout (LBO): These models are built to facilitate the purchase of 
a company or asset with large amounts of debt to finance the deal, called a 
leveraged buyout. The entity acquiring the “target” company or asset usually 
finances the deal with some equity, using the target’s assets as security — in 
the same way that many home loan mortgages work. LBOs are a popular 
method of acquisition because they allow the entity to make large purchases 
without committing a lot of cash. Modeling is an important part of the LBO 
deal because of its complexity and the high stakes involved.
»
» Discounted cash flow (DCF): These models calculate the cash expected to be 
received from the business or asset a company is considering purchasing, and 
then discounts that cash flow back into today’s dollars to see whether the 
opportunity is worth pursuing. Valuing the future cash flows expected from an 
acquisition is the most common modeling method of valuation. Intrinsic to 
the DCF methodology is the concept of the time value of money — in other 
words, that cash received today is worth a lot more than the same amount of 
cash received in future years. For an example of how to calculate DCF, turn to 
Chapter 11.
Reporting models
Because they look historically at what occurred in the past, some people argue that 
reporting models are not really financial models at all, but I disagree. The prin-
ciples, layout, and design that are used to create a reporting model are identical to 
other financial models. Just because they contain historical rather than projected 
numbers doesn’t mean they should be categorized any differently.
In fact, reporting models are often used to create actual versus budget reports, 
which often include forecasts and rolling forecasts, which in turn are driven by 
assumptions and other drivers. Reporting models often start out as a simple 
income statement report, but end up being transformed into fully integrated 
financial statement models, pricing models, project finance models, or valuation 
models.

14      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
PUTTING “FINANCIAL MODELING” 
ON YOUR RÉSUMÉ
When you know exactly what’s involved in the modeling process and you have knowl-
edge of financial modeling skills that you’ve used in the workplace, you’re ready to put 
“financial modeling” on your résumé.
Since the economic crisis of 2008, emphasis on financial modeling has increased. In 
response, there has been a rise in job descriptions specifying financial modeling as a 
core competency. If you’re applying for a job in finance, employers will no doubt look 
favorably upon this skill, as long as it rings true with the rest of your résumé. You need 
to be able to flesh out the tasks in previous positions you’ve held with examples of what 
kinds of models you built.
Although short vocational courses in financial modeling (see “What it takes to be a finan-
cial modeler,” earlier in this chapter) are well respected, what prospective employers 
really want to see is the application of financial modeling techniques in your everyday 
work.
Just reading this book or taking a financial modeling training course doesn’t mean you 
can add “financial modeling” to your résumé. You need to have actually used your mod-
eling skills in the real-world environment. Take every opportunity to use models in your 
work. If you’re not currently employed, find example models online, take them apart, 
and see how you can improve them.
Whatever you do, don’t exaggerate when it comes to the level of experience you have 
with financial modeling. You may be asked in the interview to back up and discuss in 
great detail the intricacies of how you created a particular model.

Getting Acquainted 
with Excel
F
or most people, Microsoft Excel and financial modeling go hand in hand. 
Given the title of this book, it should come as no surprise to you that I assume 
you’ll be using Excel. In order to build a financial model, you need at least a 
working knowledge of Excel. So, before jumping into the details of financial mod-
eling, I’m going to introduce you to the tool you’ll be using, Microsoft Excel.
Almost every financial model you’ll come across will make use of Excel to some 
extent, but alternatives to Excel do exist, as do add-ins to improve Excel, both of 
which I cover in this chapter. Finally, I look at some of the issues and risks related 
to the use of Excel, just so you know what to expect.
Making Sense of the Different  
Versions of Excel
Every few years, Microsoft brings out a new version of Excel. For users who are 
comfortable with the way their version of Excel works, these changes are often 
met with apprehension or dismay. But for avid Excel fans like me, each new 
release is a cause for excitement! I’m always eager to find out what new tools and 
Chapter 2

16      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
features have been introduced to improve the process of building financial models 
in Excel.
Although major changes have been applied to Excel over the past few versions, the 
changes are less relevant for financial modelers than they are for some other 
folks. Why? Because many of the new features are visual, and financial modeling 
relies less on visual features and more on links and formulas, which haven’t 
changed.
Some new functions have been introduced in recent versions of Excel. If you build 
a model that contains these new functions and a user opens it in a previous ver-
sion of Excel, he’ll get a #N/A error. I recommend avoiding new functions when 
you’re building a financial model, unless you’re sure that anyone who needs to 
use your model will be using the same version of Excel as you.
If you’re not sure whether you’ve used any functions or features not available in 
previous versions of Excel, use the Inspect Workbook tool (see Chapter 5) to find out.
And if you’re not sure which version of Excel you’re using, open Excel and choose 
File ➪   Account ➪   About Excel. At the top of the dialog box that appears, you’ll see 
the version number. If that doesn’t work, then you’re probably using a very old 
version; choose Help ➪   Resources ➪   About.
A rundown of recent Excel versions
In this section, I walk you through some of the features introduced in recent ver-
sions of Excel. Although these lists are not exhaustive, they are the features you’re 
most likely to use for the purposes of financial modeling and analysis.
If you have Excel on an Office 365 subscription plan, you get new features as soon 
as they roll out with each update, instead of having to wait for the next version of 
Excel.
Microsoft Excel 2016
In Excel 2016, the following features were added:
»
» The Tell Me What You Want to Do box was added to the Ribbon. This box is 
a very user-friendly way of finding your way around Excel.
»
» The following new charts were added: Waterfall, Treemap, Sunburst, 
Histogram, Box & Whisker, and Funnel. These new charts are a welcome 
addition to Excel and make it very easy to display the results of your financial 
model. But remember that if you insert any of these new charts into your 
www.allitebooks.com

CHAPTER 2  Getting Acquainted with Excel      17
model and a user opens it in a previous version of Excel, the charts won’t be 
available — they’ll only be able to see a blank white box.
»
» Power Query was changed to Get & Transform. It’s on the Data tab on the 
Ribbon. In prior versions of Excel, Power Query had to be installed as a free 
downloadable add-in, but Get & Transform comes standard.
»
» Forecast Sheet was added. It’s a very powerful way of forecasting using 
historical data.
»
» The following new functions were introduced. Note these functions are only 
available in Excel 2016 to Office 365 subscribers:
•	 TEXTJOIN: Use this function to link the text in ranges of cells together. This 
is one of my favorite new functions because you can now string entire 
ranges of cells together, instead of linking them individually as you had to 
do with the ampersand (&) or the CONCATENATE function.
•	 CONCAT: Use this function to link the text in individual cells together. This 
was called CONCATENATE in previous versions. You can also use the 
ampersand (&) instead of CONCAT or CONCATENATE.
•	 IFS: Use this function if you have multiple conditions to include in a single 
cell. This function makes using a nested IF function much easier.
•	 SWITCH: Use this function to look up a list of values and return a matching 
result in a single cell.
•	 MAXIFS: Use this function to calculate the maximum value that meets 
specific criteria.
•	 MINIFS: Use this function to calculate the minimum value that meets 
specific criteria.
Even though these new functions might come in handy, they won’t work 
properly if the person opening your model is not using Excel 2016 or later.
Microsoft Excel 2013
In Excel 2013, the following features were added:
»
» Flash Fill was introduced. Flash Fill is a handy tool that picks up on the pattern 
of what you’ve entered.
To use Flash Fill, start typing an abbreviated version of your data in the column 
directly next to it, as shown in Figure 2-1. Based on the pattern of what you’ve 
typed, a grayed-out version of suggested text is displayed. Press Enter to accept 
this data. If you’d like to try this out for yourself, you can download File 0201.xlsx 
from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd. Open it and select 
the tab labeled 2-1.

18      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
»
» The Combo Chart was introduced as a standard chart. Combo Charts display 
a line chart and a bar chart on two different axes. For example, you might 
choose to show customer numbers on one axis and profitability on the other, 
as shown in Figure 2-2.
FIGURE 2-1: 
Flash Fill.
FIGURE 2-2:

CHAPTER 2  Getting Acquainted with Excel      19
»
» Multiple monitors were made easier to work with because the interface 
changed so that you can have two separate files open and view them side by 
side. In the past, you would have had to open a completely new session of 
Excel to do this, so you couldn’t link between files. Whether you link between 
files or not, having large and/or multiple monitors is definitely recommended 
for large and complex models!
»
» Fifty new functions were introduced, enhancing the already abundant 
function set. Most of the new functions are used for statistics, trigonometry, 
and engineering, but here are a few that you might find useful for financial 
modeling:
•	 PDURATION: Use this function to return the number of investment 
periods required for the invested amount to get to the specific value.
•	 IFNA: Use this function to suppress an #N/A error only.
•	 ISFORMULA: Use this function to return the value TRUE if the cell contains 
a formula. This function is similar to the ISERROR, ISNUM, and ISTEXT 
functions.
Even though these functions might come in handy, they’ll return an error if 
the person opening your model is not using Excel 2013 or later.
Microsoft Excel 2010
At first glance, there were no obvious changes introduced in Excel 2010, but this 
upgrade was actually deceivingly radical because it was the first version to intro-
duce the Power Suite of tools, now called Modern Excel. Additionally, two other 
features made an appearance for the first time:
»
» Slicers: Slicers are a great way of filtering PivotTables.
»
» Sparklines: Sparklines are tiny charts in a single cell. They’re a great way of 
displaying trends in a small space.
Figure 2-3 shows an example of a PivotTable with a slicer on the left in column A 
and a series of sparklines in column D. When you select one of the regions shown 
in the slicer, the data for the PivotTable filters to show only that selection. Addi-
tionally, sparklines in column D show the trend over a 12-month period of that 
line item.
These two features, although not related, work together so that when Africa is 
selected, for example, the total profit and loss numbers for Africa show only in 
column C, and the 12-month trend for Africa in the sparklines show only in  
column D. Both slicers and sparklines were particularly useful additions for build-
ing dashboards.

20      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
The space in which slicers and sparklines are built will simply show as blank areas 
if the file is opened in Excel 2007 or earlier.
Microsoft Excel Online
You can use Excel online through a web browser with Microsoft Excel Online. 
Microsoft Excel Online is completely free, works on any browser, and is useful for 
shared files and collaborating with others. It’s basically a stripped-down version 
of Excel.
Microsoft Excel Online is only sufficient for a casual user of Excel, not for a finan-
cial modeler. You need a desktop version of Excel in order to work through the 
steps in this book.
Focusing on file formats
Another thing that you may need to consider when working with different ver-
sions of Excel is the file type. Way back in Excel 2007, the file formats were 
changed from XLS to XLSX. The XLSX file format is more secure, faster, and more 
compact than XLS files. Also, XLS files are also limited to 65,000 rows, which 
sounds like a lot, but XLSX files can handle up to a million rows.
Although the XLSX file type has been around for many years, Excel files that have 
been downloaded from another system are sometimes automatically saved as XLS 
files. If you have Excel 2007 or later, you can save the file as XLSX by choosing 
File ➪   Save As, and changing the file type from Excel 97–2003 to Excel Workbook.
FIGURE 2-3: 
Slicer and 
sparklines.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Acquainted with Excel      21
You might also run into the XLSM file format. Those files contain macros, which 
contain executable code. If you’re using macros, Excel will prompt you to save the 
file as XLSM. And if you accidently save a file with macros in it as XLSX, all the 
macros will completely disappear!
The XLSB file format is a binary file format and is even more compressed than 
XLSX, making the file size even smaller (which means the files open and save 
much faster than other file types). It has the added advantage of supporting mac-
ros. The only disadvantage is that XLSB files can’t be read by other databases and 
software, including other cloud-based spreadsheet programs (although that’s not 
usually an issue for financial models).
You should always save your models as XLSX file types, or XLSB if file size becomes 
an issue.
Defining Modern Excel
Any version of Excel released from Excel 2010 onward is referred to as Modern 
Excel because it introduced the groundbreaking Power Suite, which consists of 
Power Pivot, Power Query (now called Get & Transform), and Power View (as well 
as Power Map and Power BI, which were added later). The introduction of these 
tools was the most exciting thing to happen in the Excel world since the 
PivotTable.
Table 2-1 offers a summary of the features of Modern Excel.
The self-service BI space, in particular, is growing rapidly, and there are many 
other pieces of software that can perform similar tasks. In my opinion, these 
Modern Excel tools are the way to go for handling and visualizing data for the fol-
lowing reasons:
»
» Low cost: Power BI Pro (with larger data capacity and enhanced sharing 
capabilities over standard Power BI) comes with a small monthly cost, but the 
other tools are included with your Excel license.
»
» Familiarity: Because they’re part of Excel, and mostly use the familiar Excel 
interface, existing Excel users can get the hang of it more quickly than 
completely new software — although Power Pivot can take some time to 
figure out.
»
» Integration: It’s pretty easy to convince the boss to implement these tools 
because they’re already part of Excel.

22      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Many financial modelers I know don’t see these new tools as being relevant  
to them. Sure, they are data analysis tools as opposed to modeling tools, but 
­modelers spend a lot of time extracting, updating, and manipulating data. Power 
Query, in particular, is a useful tool for performing these tasks more quickly and 
efficiently.
The Modern Excel tool that is the most likely to be used for modeling is Power 
Pivot. As a self-service BI product, Power Pivot is intended to allow users with no 
specialized BI or analytics training to develop data models and calculations, shar-
ing them either directly in Excel or through SharePoint document libraries. You 
should consider using Power Pivot for the data in your model if any of the follow-
ing is true:

»
» The data your model is using contains many thousands of rows and your 
model is starting to slow down, especially when you add formulas.
»
» You use PivotTables or tables extensively.
»
» Your data needs to be sourced from multiple locations.
The disadvantage of using Power Pivot is that, although you don’t need to be a BI 
specialist to view and edit reports, learning how to build models with Power Pivot 
is not particularly straightforward, even for advanced Excel users. You can get 
started on these tools with some free YouTube videos.
As a modeler, you’ll be using Excel all day every day, and you need to keep up to 
date with all the changes, including the new tools of Modern Excel, because 
Microsoft releases new updates regularly. Throughout this book, I recommend the 
use of these tools to access, retrieve, or update the data for your model, or to dis-
play the outputs, but in terms of building your financial model, I’ll stick with plain 
vanilla Excel.
For more information on some of the tools in Modern Excel, check out Microsoft 
Excel Power Pivot & Power Query For Dummies by Michael Alexander (Wiley).
Recognizing the Dangers of Using Excel
Financial modelers, like anyone working extensively with Excel, are very aware of 
the inherent risks involved. According to a study by Ray Panko, who is a leading 
authority on spreadsheet practices, close to 90 percent of spreadsheets contain 
errors.
Some managers treat models as though they are able to produce the answer to all 
their business decisions and solve all their business problems. It’s frightening to 
see the blind faith that many managers have in their financial models.
After reading this book, you should have a good idea of the importance of financial 
modeling in businesses today. The reliance on Excel-based financial models is so 
entrenched within the culture of many organizations, and the practice of handing 
“legacy models” over to junior staff who don’t understand how the models work 
is a widespread practice. Models that have been used over and over for many years 
are passed on and reused. As a consultant, I’ve seen this time and again — the 
user doesn’t understand how the model works, but he’s “fairly confident” it’s 
giving him the correct results.
According to both PwC and KPMG (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/22/
managing_spreadsheet_fraud), more than 90 percent of corporate spreadsheets 

24      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
contain material errors. Considering the importance of spreadsheets in business, 
this risk is not one to be taken lightly. The European Spreadsheet Risk Group 
(EuSpRIG) was set up in 1999 purely for the purpose of addressing issues of 
spreadsheet integrity. They research and report on spreadsheet horror stories, 
which contain the latest spreadsheet-related errors reported in the media and how 
they could have been avoided. The disastrous consequences of uncontrolled use of 
spreadsheets are always disturbing, and make for somewhat gruesome reading.
I’m always terrified when people say that they’re going to go ahead with a 
multimillion-dollar project “because of the results of the financial model.” It’s 
very easy to get a formula wrong, or for the input assumptions to be just a few 
basis points out, all of which may well have a material impact on the output. 
Tweaking the input assumptions by just a few dollars either way can have a huge 
impact on cash flow, profitability, and the downright viability of a project!
We know that both formula and logic errors are very easy to make and prevalent 
in corporate financial models. As a financial modeler, you should be vigilantly 
looking for errors as you build the model. For strategies for reducing error in your 
models, turn to Chapter 13.
Although the major dangers of using Excel relate to its susceptibility to errors, the 
related issues of capacity and lack of discipline also warrant a mention. In this 
section, I take a closer look at each of these issues.
Capacity
Prior to Excel 2007, the maximum number of rows that Excel could handle was 
65,000. That may seem like a lot, especially if you’re just getting started with 
Excel, but it’s nowhere near enough. The average Excel user would regularly run 
out of rows and have to resort to using Microsoft Access or keeping data in mul-
tiple workbooks to store the data. My, how things have changed!
From Excel 2007 onward, the number of rows was increased to over a million, 
which seemed like a big improvement at the time. In this age of big data, though, 
it’s still pretty easy to run out of rows, especially when you start running a few 
formulas down the column. Realistically, anything more than half a million rows 
becomes very slow using ordinary Excel.
I still classify the lack of capacity of Excel as a danger because, despite all the new 
capabilities of Modern Excel, many of them are still being developed and few peo-
ple are using them to their full capacity yet. To deal with the size limitations of 
Excel when working with large amounts of data, people are still cutting the data 
into various chunks, importing and exporting from Access or other databases to 
avoid having to store data, and deleting archived data, all of which are dangerous 
practices because they’re prone to error and are unbelievably time-consuming.

CHAPTER 2  Getting Acquainted with Excel      25
Lack of discipline
Excel is a highly flexible tool. You can pretty much do anything in Excel, but it 
doesn’t mean that you should! One of the reasons I love it so much is the lack of 
boundaries or restrictions. Most software forces you to use it in a certain way, but 
Excel allows you to type anything into any cell.
Now, as wonderful as it is to be without boundaries, it’s also incredibly dangerous 
and somewhat alarming. You know just how much damage can be done with an 
incorrect financial model, and the fact that there are no checks and balances — 
except what you as the modeler put into it — is a terrifying prospect.
Many of the best practices of financial modeling, such as those laid out in 
­Chapter 4, have been created for the purpose of contending with this lack of dis-
cipline in financial models. Error checks, formatting, and rules about model lay-
out, design, and structure are all designed to put some boundaries around a model, 
which, without them, becomes a dangerous tool in the wrong hands.
Errors
The possibility of error in a model is the number-one thing that keeps a financial 
modeler awake at night. As a modeler, you must have a healthy respect for spread-
sheets and their susceptibility to error.
Imagine you’re working on an exciting new project. You’ve provided a financial 
model that’s being used for a project or key function of your business. It looks 
fantastic. People are fired up; money is being spent. But weeks or months into the 
project, the numbers suddenly aren’t adding up. Why is the project so far over 
WORKING WITH LARGE DATA SETS
If you’re working with enough data to slow down your Excel (and by large amounts of 
data, I mean more than 100,000 rows), consider storing the data in Power Pivot instead 
and just access the data into your model as you need it.
If you’re using Power Pivot, you’ll probably find it beneficial to upgrade to 64-bit Excel. 
Most people are running 32-bit Excel on a 64-bit machine. If that’s you, you’re not seeing 
the full power of Excel. Bear in mind though, that upgrading to 64-bit Excel means 
upgrading all your software, which might be more than you bargained for.
Finally, store any large blocks of data using structured reference tables. Click anywhere 
on your block of data and use the shortcut Ctrl+T to create a table.

26      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
budget? On review, you suddenly realize there has been an error in your original 
calculations. Yikes! Your credibility and confidence in your work are being ques-
tioned, leading to some uncomfortable moments during meetings (not to men-
tion, concern over your future at the company).
The European Spreadsheets Risks Interest Group (EuSpRiG) runs a well-­established 
annual conference to present the latest research and findings on the subject. There 
are many well-documented cases of high-profile Excel model blunders. Some of 
these are documented by EuSpRiG at www.eusprig.org/stories.htm. Given the 
reluctance of most businesses to talk about their mistakes, the number and fre-
quency of the stories documented by EuSpRiG lead me to believe that errors in 
spreadsheets are a regular occurrence in most organizations.
What form can these errors take? Generally, modeling errors can be grouped into 
three broad categories: formula errors, assumptions or input errors, and logic 
errors.
Formula errors
Formula errors are the easiest errors to make and relatively easy to spot, but 
they’re horribly embarrassing when they’re discovered. These kinds of “mechan-
ical” errors are also the easiest to avoid by self-checking and correction. Chap-
ter 13 covers some techniques you should employ while building your model to 
reduce the possibility of formula errors.
A common formula error is simply picking up the wrong cell in the formula — for 
example, linking to cell B98, which contains 6, instead of cell B97, which contains 
0.6. This error initially might seem quite minor, but let’s say your initial invest-
ment was $100,000. Through your modeling, you work out that there is 60 per-
cent profit margin, but due to this error, you predict $600,000 profit instead of 
$60,000. Oops!
Assumptions or input errors
Your model’s formulas may be calculating perfectly, but assumptions in financial 
models are a textbook case of “garbage in, garbage out.” If the assumptions 
you’ve used as inputs are incorrect, the model will also be incorrect.
When it comes to input errors there are two main types to consider:
»
» Data input: Data input errors can easily occur if you’re updating operating 
costs, for example, on a week-to-week basis. If these costs aren’t linked 
correctly or refreshed regularly, you can get an incomplete or inaccurate picture 
of the process. Sometimes linking this information to a separate, automatically 

CHAPTER 2  Getting Acquainted with Excel      27
generated file and using some of the new Modern Excel tools such as Get & 
Transform (formerly called Power Query) can automate and expedite this 
process. Also, be sure to confirm who is responsible for updating the spread-
sheet and make sure any changes to the process or update schedule don’t 
affect your model.
»
» User input: User input errors occur more frequently when you’re less familiar 
with the product or project you’re modeling. For example, when it comes to 
the salary costs of a program, you may factor in the benefits that an employee 
will receive and assume it will be 5 percent of her salary, which is a fairly 
standard across-the-board assumption. However, because you’re new to the 
organization, you may fail to take into account other factors that affect the 
employee’s benefits, such as an increase in the cost of delivering the dental 
and medical program that the company prides itself on. Suddenly, this drives 
the cost to 12.5 percent of salary, completely blowing out all the staff costs 
you’ve so carefully calculated.
If you’re making assumptions, you need to record them, consider them, and lay 
them out carefully in your model. (See Chapter  4 for more information about 
assumptions documentation.) It’s also a good idea to confirm these inputs with 
the key stakeholders.
The old saying “Too many cooks spoil the broth” most certainly applies to building 
a financial model. Unless you have a strict, collaborative set of standards that will 
ensure that the model is laid out and assumptions are entered consistently, you’ll 
achieve the best result by having only one modeler working to build the model. 
When it comes to using the model, however, anyone should be able to use a well-
built model. If you’re worried about people messing up your calculations or enter-
ing inputs incorrectly, make sure your instructions and documentation explain 
how to use the model. Also, apply data validations or cell protection to the model 
to restrict changes the user can make.
Logic errors
Errors in the model’s logic are probably the most difficult to spot, because you can 
have the assumptions, inputs, and formulas all working perfectly, but the logic 
and methodology — the way the model is built — can still be incorrect. You must 
capture the logic and ensure that the builder’s approach is clear. Otherwise, if you 
lose the key person who built the model, confusion can ensue.
For example, in Figure  2-4, the model shows the percentage of the investor’s 
funds that have been loaned. The percentage has been calculated by dividing the 
investment balance (the current investment plus the new investment) by the port-
folio balance (the current loans plus the new loans minus the loans expired).

28      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Hold on a second. Do you calculate it based on the number of loans written or the 
cumulative balance? You can see how the way the ratio has been calculated can 
cause confusion for those not familiar with this model. It’s important to docu-
ment how you’re calculating it. You might also easily confuse monthly amounts 
with cumulative balance; you can see that this is clearly documented in column B.
Looking at Alternatives  
and Supplements to Excel
Excel is often called the “Swiss Army knife of software” or the “second-best solu-
tion” because you can do practically anything in Excel, but it’s not always the best 
tool for the job. You can write a letter in Excel for example, but Word is a much 
better tool for that purpose. You can keep your company accounts in Excel, but a 
purpose-built general ledger system will deliver a much better result.
Desktop spreadsheets are so popular because they’re easy to use to communicate 
ideas and strategies in an understandable business model. Working in an analytic 
role, the spreadsheet actually becomes part of the way people think about busi-
ness issues and relationships — the tool shapes the very way you consider your 
approach. The spreadsheet tool actually becomes a part of the process of the anal-
ysis, so you’ll sometimes hear people say, “Let’s get this into Excel and see what 
it looks like!”
So, what are the other options available? Instead of assuming that Excel is the best 
tool for financial modeling, you should be aware of the alternatives, as well as 
some of the add-ins that supplement Excel specifically for the purpose of finan-
cial modeling. Here’s a list of some of the alternatives and supplements to Excel. 
Keep in mind that this isn’t a comprehensive list, and I’m not endorsing any of 
these products. These are just options worth your consideration:
FIGURE 2-4:

CHAPTER 2  Getting Acquainted with Excel      29
»
» Data extraction and analysis: SAS, KNIME, Tableau, and Oracle-based tools 
are no doubt far more robust and secure than Excel solutions that pull data 
from other systems into Excel manually such as macros or Power Query in Excel. 
These kinds of enterprise-grade solutions are purpose-built for the extraction 
and analysis of data and are a good long-term solution, but they’re often difficult 
to use and they take a long time to implement due to lack of familiarity.
»
» Planning and performance management: Anaplan and Tagetik are 
alternate cloud-based options that are designed to replace spreadsheets 
altogether. These tools offer powerful capabilities that support analysts in 
forward planning and making confident decisions based on data rather than 
spending their time correcting errors.
»
» Excel add-ins for model building: Modano is a modular content manage-
ment and sharing platform for Excel, enabling pieces of spreadsheets to be 
reused, shared, and linked to save time and reduce risk. Its main application is 
financial modeling, but it can be used to modularize any spreadsheet. Instead 
of replacing Excel, Modano improves Excel and combats some of its inefficien-
cies and shortcomings. Modano replaces BPM, an older Excel add-in that 
systemized the implementation and review of spreadsheet best practices.
»
» Excel add-ins for auditing: Spreadsheet Advantage, Spreadsheet Detective, 
Spreadsheet Professional, and OAK are Excel add-ins that can help develop 
and review financial models. They interrogate a spreadsheet in extreme detail 
to help identify where you might have an error. The software produces key 
statistics on any spreadsheet, such as the number of unique formulas, where 
the formulas can be found across each sheet, and the relationships between 
sheets. It also produces a map of each cell to indicate whether that cell is a 
text, number, new, or consistent formula.
»
» Dashboards and data visualization: Once you’ve finished building your 
financial model, you may like to display the results in a chart or a dashboard. 
This can be done on the front sheet of an Excel workbook, in Microsoft Power 
BI, or using one of hundreds of other purpose-built data visualization and 
dashboarding tools. One such tool is Modeler, which can transform your 
model into an app with no coding, using just Excel and PowerPoint. The most 
popular non-Microsoft tools at the moment are Tableau and QlickView, but 
this area is growing rapidly. See Chapter 9 for more information about how to 
present your model output using standard Excel tools.
»
» Budgeting and forecasting: Many of the models you’ll build are for the purpose 
of budgeting and forecasting — and then reporting on those budgets and 
forecasts. Most major general ledger systems have additional modules available 
that are built specifically for the purpose of budgeting, forecasting, and reporting. 
These tools provide a much easier, quicker method of creating budgets and 
forecasts that is far more robust and less error-prone than using Excel templates. 
Hundreds of budgeting and forecasting tools are available; some of the most 
popular are Board, Oracle (JD Edwards), TM1 (Cognos), and Adaptive Insights.

30      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
THE CASE FOR EXCEL
So, why do we still use Excel, even though a “better” solution might exist? Here are some 
of the reasons:
•	 Every business already has Excel installed. Your company doesn’t have to pur-
chase extra licenses or pay for expensive consultants to install it.
•	 Little training is needed. Most users have some familiarity with Excel, which 
means other people will be able to edit, change, and understand your Excel model.
•	 Excel is very flexible. You can build almost anything you can imagine in Excel 
(within size limitations, of course).
•	 Excel “talks” to other systems very well. With Excel, you can report, model, and 
contrast virtually any data, from any source, all in one report.
•	 Most important, Excel is commonly used across all industries, countries, and 
organizations. This means that the Excel skills you already have, and the skills 
you’ll hone by reading this book, are highly transferrable. You can use those skills in 
other jobs at other companies no matter where your career takes you. Sure, there 
are thousands of other pieces of software that you can learn, but I believe that for a 
career in finance, one of the best things you can do for your career is to improve your 
Excel skills.
Of course, I can’t predict the future, but it’s difficult to imagine a world where Excel is not 
the dominant finance software.

Planning and Designing 
Your Financial Model
P
lanning and design can sometimes be the most difficult part of building a 
financial model — especially for those of us whose skills are more technical 
and numerical than visual. When building your model, you need to pay close 
attention to the design layout and ensure that it’s clear, coherent, and logically 
structured. Even a very simple model can become complex if poorly designed, and 
a well-designed model will be so logical that it will simply speak for itself.
Before jumping in and starting to build the model, take a moment to think about 
what your model needs to achieve — this will help with the design build.
Identifying the Problem That Your 
Financial Model Needs to Solve
A financial model is usually built in order to answer a question or to solve a 
­problem. For example, the question “Should I purchase this new asset?” could 
result in a model containing cash flow analysis, which compares the cash flow if 
Chapter 3

32      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
the asset is purchased versus if it is not purchased. “How much should I pay for 
this new asset?” is an entirely different question, and the answer will be a single 
number or a range of possible numbers.
You need to identify the problem before beginning the model-building process.
For example, if the model you’re building is for the purpose of making a decision, 
you need to build at least two scenarios — one with the existing business and one 
including the new venture — as well as a comparison between them. Modelers 
sometimes call this a “do nothing” versus as “do something” scenario. So the 
model will consist of three components:
»
» “Do nothing” scenario
»
» “Do something” scenario
»
» Scenario comparison
In the example shown in Figure 3-1, a small bus company has serviced two bus 
routes for many years. The financial model shows 12 months of historical data and 
has forecast the next 12 months. Due to a change in demographics and a new train 
line servicing the area, ticket sales for the northern route have been declining 
consistently, and the company expects this trend to continue. If the company does 
nothing, as shown, the profits will more than halve over a two-year period.
FIGURE 3-1: 
“Do nothing” 
scenario

CHAPTER 3  Planning and Designing Your Financial Model      33
You can download a sample copy of this model in File 0302.xlsx at www.dummies.
com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd.
You start building this model by creating the three tabs and determining that the 
comparison sheet should contain a comparison between the two scenarios. Then 
you design the “do nothing” scenario and then look at how different the numbers 
are if the company adds a new bus line.
Keeping models consistent is important. For this reason, the “do nothing” sce-
nario contains an extra blank row in each block of data, which is where the new 
western route can be inserted. The Total Profit line is shown in row 27 of both 
scenario pages, which makes the model easier to follow, and less prone to error 
when linking the charts and summary page to the outputs.
Because this model is quite small, you don’t need separate input and assumptions 
sheets, as you do with larger models. The inputs and assumptions are listed within 
the scenario sheets themselves.
If the company decides to put on a new route to service the western regions, you 
can replace some of the lost sales from the northern routes with the new service. 
In the “do something” scenario shown in Figure 3-2, you can see that although 
not all the lost profitability has been recouped, the bus company is still viable.
When using a financial model to make a decision, you need to look at the difference 
between the two scenarios. If you only look at the “do something” scenario in 
isolation, it doesn’t look particularly appealing.
FIGURE 3-2: 
“Do something” 
scenario.

34      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Figure 3-3 compares the two scenarios to help decide on a course of action. You 
can see from the comparison sheet that the best course of action would be to “do 
something” — assuming, of course, that these are the only options available to us.
Designing How the Problem’s  
Answer Will Look
When you’ve identified the problem that needs to be solved, it’s very tempting to 
dive straight in and begin the model-building process, but it’s a good idea to stop 
for a moment to plan the model and determine how the output will look. When it 
comes to building a financial model, you want to start with the end in mind.
Start by creating a mockup design of the output page. You can do this in Excel, or 
by simply sketching it on a whiteboard or paper. It can be difficult to visualize 
what the output will look like until you have the data in it. Modelers aren’t often 
the most artistic types, but you should have at least some idea of the elements that 
need to be on the output page.
For example, for a business case, let’s say you want to show the net present value 
(NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period. To do this, you need cash 
flow, so the key elements will be revenue and expenses, from which you can derive 
profitability, and then the NPV, IRR, and payback. You could flesh out the outputs 
page something like the design shown in Figure 3-4.
FIGURE 3-3: 
Comparison 
between 
scenarios.

CHAPTER 3  Planning and Designing Your Financial Model      35
Then, having completed the financial model, you decide to include some scenario 
analysis, as well as the customer numbers. The final output page ends up as shown 
in Figure 3-5. For more information about displaying data visually, see Chapter 9.
When you have the numbers in the model, you should try to include at least one 
chart. If you’re not sure how the data will look visually, you can highlight a range 
of numbers, go to the Insert tab of the Ribbon, and in the Charts section, press the 
Recommended Charts button. This gives you a preview of what the data will look 
like displayed in the chart.

36      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Often, the output of a financial model will be in the form of a dashboard, which is 
a great way of displaying a lot of information clearly and concisely. Building dash-
boards in Excel has become so popular in recent years that I run dedicated training 
courses on dashboard reporting, which are particularly popular with financial 
modelers who need to display the output of their financial models. Figure 3-6 
shows a sample output of a financial model such as the financial statements model 
built in Chapter 10. You can download a sample copy of this model in File 0303.xlsx 
at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd.
Here are some tips for designing a dashboard to display the output of your  
financial model:
»
» Don’t overwhelm your users with numbers on a dashboard. Wherever 
possible, show visuals and charts instead of numbers. Use data labels or a 
data table (as shown in the lower-left corner of Figure 3-6) if you want to show 
numbers on a chart.
»
» Use contrasting techniques, such as color, bold, and shading to highlight 
key points. But don’t rely on color alone to show your message, because 
models are often printed in black and white.
»
» Align objects so they line up tidily.

» Make sure the model fits neatly onto one page. That way, people can 
easily print it and refer to it (without needing a magnifying glass).

» Apply the “golden triangle.” Your key message or the most important 
information should be placed in the upper-left corner — this is where readers 
will look first.
»
» Put some effort into the color scheme. Excel randomly allocates standard 
colors (usually red and blue) to charts, but you should change the colors to 
match your model theme or company colors to add professional “polish” to 
your model.
»
» Avoid the traffic light combination of red, yellow, and green. The 
difference between red and green isn’t obvious to those who are color blind. 
(That’s around 8 percent of the male population!)
»
» Use icon sets. To apply them, highlight some numerical data and choose one 
of the sets of icons, such as ticks, crosses, or flags which appear when you  
click on Icon Sets under Conditional Formatting from the Styles section of the 
Ribbon. This will automatically add extra meaning to your dashboard without 
relying on color.
»
» Make sure the color you use has meaning. The colors should not be reused 
inconsistently. For example, if revenue is blue in one chart, the same blue 
should not then be used for expenses on another chart.
»
» Use color sparingly. Many legacy models I come across in my consultancy 
work have very bright rainbow colors, which (aside from blinding the user) 
make it difficult to focus on the key components of the model. Using some 
color to make your model appealing is a good idea, but stick to a single color 
that matches your company logo (or your mood) and use different shades of 
the same color unless you want something to stand out significantly.
Some companies have standard color coding, but if your company doesn’t, you 
might consider developing a standard. Consider including a color code key on 
the cover page. The use of predefined styles found on the Home tab can make 
color coding very quick and easy. Many companies have their predefined color 
coding loaded as style templates, which ensures consistency in color coding in 
financial models. Here are some commonly used color codes that are supported 
by the built-in styles in Excel that you may consider adopting in your company:
•	 Blue font and beige background for input cells
•	 Pink or gray for error checks
•	 Green or orange for external links
To match the logo of your company, find out the RGB color code and use this 
code to apply the exact same colors to your model’s headings, totals, or 
charts. Considering that millions of different colors are available in Excel, it’s 
almost impossible to pick the correct one by eye.

FINDING AN RGB COLOR
If you don’t know the RGB color that’s been used in your company logo or the image 
you’d like to insert in the model, you can easily find the color code by following these 
steps:
1.	 Open the image in Microsoft Paint, and click the color with the color picker.
You can find the color picker in the Tools section of the Home tab.
2.	 Click Edit Colors on the right side of the Home tab.
The amount of red, green, and blue (RGB) is shown. In the example shown here, I 
clicked one of the purple circles of my logo, which gave the exact RGB color code 
that the designer originally used to create the logo (Red = 80, Green = 32, Blue =70).
When you have the RGB color, you can use the color in your Excel model.
3.	 Highlight the cells you want to change.
4.	 On the Home tab of the Ribbon, click the arrow next to the Fill Color button in 
the Font section.
5.	 Select More Colors at the bottom.
The Color dialog box appears.

CHAPTER 3  Planning and Designing Your Financial Model      39
Gathering Data to Put in Your Model
A financial model is only as good as its inputs or source data, and a large part of the 
modeler’s job is often collecting, interpreting, analyzing, and even manipulating 
or extrapolating the data to go into the model. In many cases, as much time can be 
spent collecting data as is spent actually building the model, so if you can collect 
the data in the correct format in the first place, this could save you a lot of time.
You often have to obtain data you need to build the model from other people or 
external sources, which can be a frustrating and time-consuming process. Here 
are some guidelines that can make the data-gathering process easier:
»
» Let other parties know well in advance what information you need and 
its purpose.
»
» Give them a due date that is realistic for them and fits your time frame.
»
» Design the input sheets in your model so that the data can be pasted directly in.
6.	 Select the Custom tab.
7.	 Select the RGB colors as shown here.

40      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
»
» Use dummy data in the meantime if you need to so that you can continue 
building the model while waiting for the information to come in.
»
» Allow enough time to check the quality and reliability of the information that 
has been submitted.
»
» Make sure people know what you expect in terms of data quality. Does it need 
to be 100 percent accurate or is an estimate okay? Normally, model input data 
is simply taken at face value, and the source is documented in the assump-
tions. If an estimate is used, be sure to document it as such.
»
» Be specific about what format you need the data in. Giving them a template to 
complete can prevent misunderstandings. For example, instead of a request 
like “Please provide information on key customer accounts,” which might yield 
a list of 500 customers and their addresses, a template like the one shown in 
Figure 3-7 would give better results.
Consider using protection to prevent incorrect entry, such as restricting inputs 
to either a “yes” or a “no,” as shown in column F of Figure 3-7. For instructions 
on how to use data validations, see the section on “Restricting user data entry” 
in Chapter 6. If you’d like to try this out for yourself, you can download File 
0301.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd. Open 
it and select the tab labeled 3-7.
DETERMINING THE TIME SERIES  
FOR YOUR MODEL’S DATA
Most financial models include a time-series element. The majority of models you’re 
likely to see will be either on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. It’s important to get 
the correct time series unit right from the start, because it’s much easier to summarize a 
monthly model up to a full year than it is to split an annual model down to its monthly 
components. For an example of modeling time series, turn to Chapter 12.
Before you start gathering data to include in your model, be sure that you’re clear  
about what level of detail you’ll need the data to be in. For example, you could be  
building an annual model for your company’s fiscal year, which goes from October 1 to 
September 30, but the survey data you’ve collected and want to include is for the period 
January 1 to December 31. If you’ve got access to the raw data on a monthly basis,  
you’ll be able to manipulate the data so that it’s accurate; otherwise, you’ll need to 
extrapolate.

CHAPTER 3  Planning and Designing Your Financial Model      41
Documenting the Limitations  
of Your Model
If other people are going to be using your model, be sure to explain the assump-
tions you made in building the model, especially if the person who is going to be 
using your model is not an experienced modeler. Users tend to put blind faith in 
the outcome of the model, which can be dangerous. Instead of taking the model 
results as gospel, the user should simply use them as a guide.
Models are only a construct that reflects reality; they are not reality. You can 
make this clear to users of the model by using language such as “Based on our 
forecasts . . .” or “Assuming trends continue. . . .”
In the example of the decision analysis model for the bus company case study  
(see the section “Identifying the Problem That Your Financial Model Needs to 
Solve,” earlier in this chapter), the builder of this model might say, “We’re going 
to lose half of our profit over the next 12 months,” which is not incorrect, but it 
would be more accurate to say, “Based on current forecasts, we’re going to lose 
half of our profit over the next 12 months unless we take action” and then show 
FIGURE 3-7:

request template.

42      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
the inputs and assumptions used. For example, the modeler is assuming the 
following:
»
» Five hundred tickets will be sold in the first month of operation.
»
» Ticket sales will increase by 1.5 percent per month after the first month.
»
» There is no cannibalization between the routes. Often, when launching a 
new product, some existing customers switch to the new product. Seeing as 
the new route is servicing a new area, the modeler doesn’t expect any 
cannibalization and hasn’t included it in this model.
Considering the Layout and  
Design of Your Model
The problem that needs to be solved and the output required often influence the 
layout and design of the model. So, it’s not a bad idea to spend some time thinking 
about the layout before you get started. Not only do the layout and structure of the 
model relate to the logic and functionality, but they can also influence the look 
and feel of the model’s interface and how users navigate through the model.
When you’re building a model for the first time, you may have trouble knowing 
where to begin. The key elements of a financial model are
»
» Inputs or source data
»
» Assumptions documentation
»
» Calculations
»
» Outputs
When starting to build your model, start by laying out each of these elements in 
four separate tabs and think about what will go in each section. Separate each of 
these elements clearly. Although every model should contain these elements, not 
every financial model is structured in the same way. Unless a model is very 
small — like the bus company case study earlier in this chapter — there should be 
a dedicated tab for each major component of the model.

CHAPTER 3  Planning and Designing Your Financial Model      43
STEPS TO BUILDING A MODEL
Here are seven steps to follow when starting to build a financial model:
1.	 Design the high-level structure.
You won’t know exactly what the layout of the model will be until you actually start 
building the calculations, but you should have some idea of the tabs. Start by 
assembling the data you have so far into the broad categories described in the 
“Defining inputs, calculations, and output blocks” section later in this chapter.
2.	 Design outputs — summaries, charts, and reports.
Because you already know the problem that your financial model needs to solve, 
you should have an idea of what that answer might look like. For example, if you’re 
making a decision about investing in a new product, the output might be the result-
ing cash flow and a net present value (NPV). By thinking about the output of your 
model early on in the process, you’ll be more focused and will ensure that all your 
calculations work toward the desired end result.
3.	 Design inputs.
Set up where the inputs and source data will go. Even if you don’t have all the infor-
mation yet, set it up so that it can be dropped in at a later date. This can help you 
make sure that you ask for or gather the data in the right format, as well as design 
the model correctly. For example, do we need data for the calendar year or the 
financial year? Will you need to use the same assumption for every month/year or it 
is going to change?
4.	 Start calculating.
Start with a tab labeled “workings” or “calculations,” but keep in mind that this will 
probably expand as the model grows. Link the formulas to your inputs, but break 
larger problems into smaller ones and don’t try to attempt too much at once. You 
might begin by thinking that all expenses can go on one tab, but if depreciation, for 
example, begins getting rather complicated, you might decide that depreciation 
needs a tab of its own.
5.	 Connect outputs.
Link your calculations to the outputs page. Charts are a great way of visualizing and 
presenting the output of your model. As you’re building the outputs, test at every 
stage to make sure that the model makes sense, and adjust as necessary.
(continued)

44      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Structuring your model: What goes where
When designing the layout of a model, most experienced modelers follow these 
rules:
»
» Separate inputs, calculations, and results, where possible. Clearly label 
which sections of the model contain inputs, calculations, and results. You can 
put them on separate worksheets or separate places on one worksheet, but 
make sure that the user knows exactly what each section is for. Color coding 
can help with ensuring that each section is clearly defined.
»
» Use each column for the same purpose. This is particularly important when 
doing models involving time series. For example, in a time-series model, 
knowing that labels are in column B, unit data in column C, constant values in 
column D, and calculations in column E, makes it much easier when editing a 
formula manually.
»
» Use one formula per row or column. This forms the basis of the best- 
practice principle whereby formulas are kept consistent using absolute, 
relative, and mixed referencing, as described in greater detail in Chapter 4. 
Keep formulas consistent when in a block of data, and never change a 
formula halfway through.
»
» Refer to the left and above. The model should read logically, like a book, 
meaning that it should be read from left to right and top to bottom. 
Calculations, inputs, and outputs should flow logically to avoid circular 
referencing. Be aware that there are times when left-to-right or top-to-bottom 
data flow can conflict somewhat with ease of use and presentation, so use 
(continued)
6.	 Add scenarios.
When the model is working correctly, you can add sensitivities and scenario 
­analysis. See Chapter 8 for information about how to build scenarios into your 
model. If you’ve designed the model well in the first place, adding scenarios is a 
fairly straightforward process.
7.	 Assumptions documentation.
Most of these steps are sequential, but assumptions documentation should never 
be left right to the end. Do it as you go!
Right throughout the model-building process, be sure to test, check, and validate as  
you go. For more information on key rules to follow when building a model, turn to 
Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 3  Planning and Designing Your Financial Model      45
common sense when designing the layout. By following this practice, you can 
avoid having calculations link all over the sheet, which makes it harder to 
check and update. Excel will also calculate more quickly if you build formulas 
in this way because it calculates left to right, and top to bottom, so not only 
does it make your model easier to follow, it will calculate more efficiently.
»
» Use multiple worksheets. Avoid the temptation to put everything on one 
sheet. Especially when blocks of calculations are the same, use separate 
sheets for those that must be repeated to avoid the need to scroll across the 
screen.
»
» Include documentation sheets. A documentation sheet where assumptions 
and source data are clearly laid out is a critical part of any financial model. A 
cover sheet should not be confused with an assumptions sheet. A model can 
never have too much documentation!
Defining inputs, calculations,  
and output blocks
Typically, modelers work from back to front when building their models. The out-
put, or the part they want the viewer or user to see, is at the front, calculations are 
in the middle, and source data and assumptions are at the back. Like the executive 
summary, a board paper, or another report, the first few pages should contain 
what casual viewers need to see at a glance. If they need further information, they 
can dig deeper into the model.
Here are some guidelines of what might be included on each tab in your model:
»
» Cover sheet: Although not always included, the cover sheet contains many 
details about the model. Of course, the cover sheet is not much use unless 
you keep it up to date. If you decide to include a cover sheet, you may add 
details such as the following:
•	 A log of changes and updates to the model with date, author, change 
details, and their impact on the output of the model, which can help with 
version control
•	 The purpose of the model and how it is intended to be used going forward
•	 Who originally wrote the model and who to contact with questions
•	 Table of contents
•	 Instructions on how to use the model
•	 Disclaimers as to the limitations of the model, legal liability, and caveats
•	 Global or key assumptions integral to the use of the model

46      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
In my experience, cover sheets and instruction pages are rarely used. If you 
decide not to include a cover sheet, make sure that the model contains 
explicit instructions regarding operation, purpose, assumptions, source data, 
and disclaimers.
»
» Input sheet: This is the only place where hard-coded data should be entered. 
There may be one or more input sheets if there are large amounts of data, 
but the input data should be laid out in logical blocks.
»
» Output, summary, and scenario sheets: These present the final outcomes. 
They may also contain scenario drop-down boxes or user entry fields that 
allow the users of the model to generate their own outputs. This section might 
also contain a dashboard.
»
» Calculation or workings sheets: Split the calculation sheets logically and 
then, within each sheet, set them up consistently. If the calculations become 
long and confusing, it makes sense to split them into logical sections. For 
example, they can be split by type of service, customers, financial tables, 
geographical location, or business segments. If calculation sheets are split, 
ensure that the layout and formatting are as consistent as possible across all 
sheets.
»
» Error check sheet: This sheet contains links to all error checks in the model. 
Error checks should be performed in the calculation section, but a summary 
of all error checks in one location means that once the model is in use, the 
modelers can quickly check to see if any of the error checks have been 
triggered.
Determining your audience
Who will be viewing or using your model in the future? If it’s for only your own 
use, you should still follow good model design but there’s no need to spend a lot 
of time on the formatting to make it look cool. You should still add assumptions 
and source documentation for your own reference even if you know that no one 
will ever look at it.
No matter who you think is going to use your model, you should always adhere to 
the rules outlined in Chapter 4.
There are a few types of people who could comprise your model audience:
»
» Professional modelers: If your model is for a large-scale investment or if 
money is being lent based on the outcome of your model, you can expect that 
professional modelers are going to want to “look under the hood” of your 
model to take it apart and audit it. You can greatly reduce the cost of an audit 

CHAPTER 3  Planning and Designing Your Financial Model      47
by using consistent formulas to reduce the number of unique formulas in the 
model (see Chapter 4). Do not hide sheets or attempt to protect parts of the 
model — it will only frustrate the professional modeler who will want to see 
how your numbers were calculated.
»
» Occasional modelers: Some models will be used by people for whom looking 
at models is only part of their job — you yourself perhaps fall into this 
category. They know their way around Excel but aren’t really interested in 
understanding the intricacies of the entire model. They just want to make sure 
it’s working properly because they need to rely on the numbers and perhaps 
they need to use it by changing some of its numbers from time to time. When 
building a model for the occasional modeler, you want to make the model as 
easy to follow as possible. Keep it streamlined, and don’t clutter the output 
pages with unnecessary detail. Move any detailed and less important assump-
tions to the back so that they can be referred to only if necessary.
»
» Nonmodelers: Sometimes your model will be viewed or used by members of 
the board, salespeople, or marketing folks for whom modeling or using Excel 
is not part of their everyday lives. For example, you might be producing a 
sales dashboard report that is produced every week and the user simply 
needs to change the drop-down box to look at a different product or region. 
You want to make the output pages as simple to use and as appealing as 
possible for a nonuser of Excel. For some ideas on dashboard design and 
using color, see “Designing How the Problem’s Answer Will Look” earlier in this 
chapter. The user is unlikely to want to take the model apart and look into the 
formulas, so to simplify the way the model looks, you might consider hiding 
the calculation sheets and perhaps even the data sheets — with or without a 
password.
Password protection should only be used as a deterrent to prevent nosy colleagues. 
It’s not a security system and should not be relied upon as such. Search the web 
for Excel password remover, and you’ll find plenty of software available that can 
remove the password.
In conclusion, planning and designing a financial model is a critical part of the 
model build. It takes a unique mixture of logic, clarity of thought, and graphic 
layout skills by the financial modeler to build a well-designed model, and this 
often proves to be difficult to implement in practice. Model design can sometimes 
be the most difficult part of building a financial model and it is, in my experience, 
one of the most difficult aspects to teach and learn. Learning how to build a well-
designed model comes with experience. But a faster way to develop design skills 
is to critically assess other models you come across, taking note of what works and 
what doesn’t, and then applying it to your own models.

Model by the Rulebook
B
ecause Excel is such a wonderfully flexible and universal tool, you can pretty 
much do anything with it — but that doesn’t mean you should! A key dan-
ger of using Excel is lack of discipline, leading to dangerous errors. When 
building a financial model in Excel, you’re unlikely to encounter the limitations 
and boundaries imposed by other, less flexible software, so there are certain rules 
you should follow to avoid these issues. In this chapter, I fill you in on the key 
rules you should follow when building a financial model.
Document Your Assumptions
The term “garbage in, garbage out” is never truer than in relation to financial 
modeling. You can have the most beautifully laid-out financial model with perfect 
formatting, a great design, and fabulous-looking charts and scenario tables, but if 
the inputs that go into the financial model haven’t been verified, the model is use-
less and you can’t use the outputs. Important decisions are made based on the 
outputs of financial models, so listing the assumptions that have gone into the 
model is critical.
Chapter 4

50      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Documentation of assumptions is certainly not the most exciting part of financial 
modeling, so you may be tempted to leave it to the end. Don’t fall into this trap! 
When you’re done building your model, you won’t remember what those assump-
tions were. Document as you go. Whenever you make a structural change or even 
a minor change to one of the inputs, document it, even it if it seems unimportant 
at the time.
List assumptions on a separate page, and label them clearly, so that they can be 
easily identified and referenced at a glance. For a small model, you may decide to 
mix source data and assumptions together. In a large model, you may separate 
them with as much detail as is possible or practical. For a detailed model, you may 
list out every single detail on a Detailed Assumptions page and then summarize 
the important ones on a Key Assumptions page. Think about the level of detail in 
your model, and let that guide the detail of your documentation of assumptions.
Still not convinced that documenting assumptions is important? How’s this for 
persuasion: When you move on to another role or you’re away on vacation, and 
something goes wrong with your model, who do you think they’re going to blame? 
You guessed it! Think of documenting assumptions as covering your ass. Your 
model needs to be able to speak for you when you aren’t around to explain or 
defend your work. The documentation of assumptions should explain your thought 
process and why the model is built the way it is. That way, if there are any ques-
tions as to the accuracy of the model or the input assumptions, they can be easily 
explained by the model itself.
A model is only as good as the accuracy of the assumptions. You need to mitigate 
your liability by documenting your assumptions thoroughly and adding caveats 
where necessary.
Here are some commonly used methods for including documentation in a model:
»
» In-cell comments: There are two different methods of creating in-
cell comments:
•	 Red triangle comments: The most common method of creating an in-cell 
comment is to simply insert a comment within the cell, which appears as a 
red triangle in the corner of the cell, as shown in Figure 4-1.
To create a red triangle comment, right-click the cell and select Insert 
Comment. To make a change to an existing comment, right-click the cell 
with the comment and select Edit Comment. Similarly, to delete a com-
ment, right-click the cell and select Delete Comment.
If you want to try the examples out for yourself, you can download File 
0401.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd and 
select the tab labeled 4-1.

CHAPTER 4  Building a Financial Model by the Rulebook      51
•	 Data validation input messages: The less common method of creating 
an in-cell comment is to use data validations. These types of comments are 
more discreet, because they don’t have the red triangle in the corner and 
you don’t see the comment until you actually click on the cell, as shown in 
Figure 4-2.
FIGURE 4-1: 
Red triangle 
comments.
FIGURE 4-2: 
Data validation 
input messages.

52      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
This sort of in-cell comment is especially useful for creating little instruc-
tions and warnings regarding input data to users, because they won’t see 
the comment until they actually click the cell to enter the data.
To create a data validation input message, click the cell and then, in the 
Data Tools section of the Data tab of the Ribbon, click the Data Validation 
button and the Data Validation dialog box appears. Select the Input 
Message tab, and type the message you want to appear. This message will 
appear only when the cell is selected.
Documentation of assumptions using in-cell comments is most appropriate 
for specific information relating to only one cell or range, because they can be 
viewed only in a single cell. In-cell comments are useful for communicating 
details to another modeler about specific calculation details, because the 
comments are shown only on-screen and won’t show when printed out.  
More wide-ranging, generic assumptions should be documented using other 
methods.
Of the two types of in-cell comments, my personal preference is the data 
validation input message, because they’re neater and cleaner looking. 
Remember, though, that if the cell isn’t selected, the comment won’t be 
viewed, so make sure that the comment is only cell-specific. More important, 
general assumptions and comments should use plain text or another method 
of documentation.
»
» Hyperlinks: There are two different types of hyperlinks that are useful for 
documenting assumptions and source data in financial modeling:
•	 Cell and file hyperlinks: You can create hyperlinks to sources or other 
reference files and other sections of a model. Cell and file hyperlinks can 
aid in navigation of a long and complex model. They’re especially helpful 
for new users to find their way around the model.
To insert this kind of hyperlink, on the Insert tab, select the Hyperlink icon 
from the Links section. On the left side, select Place in This Document. 
Then select the sheet and cell reference or named range of the hyperlink 
source. You can change the Text to Display at the top to display something 
like Go to Calculations instead of Calculations!B147, for example. Similarly, 
you can insert a hyperlink to another file for source referencing.
•	 URL hyperlinks: Hyperlinks can also be used to refer to relevant websites 
directly from your spreadsheet. For example, if the interest rate you 
assume in your financial model came from a central bank’s website, you 
can simply copy the URL into a cell in your model. Note that if you’re using 
Get & Transform (formerly called Power Query) you can link data straight 
from external data sources, including websites, directly into your spread-
sheet, which can be quickly updated without having to manually open the 
website.

CHAPTER 4  Building a Financial Model by the Rulebook      53
If you’re not using Get & Transform, you can manually insert a URL 
hyperlink by copying and pasting the URL from the browser directly into 
the cell. If you don’t want to show a messy URL, you can show different 
text. On the Insert tab, select the Hyperlink icon from the Links section, and 
then select Existing File or Web Page. Paste the URL into the Address field 
at the bottom, and change the Text to Display at the top.
»
» Hard-coded text: This method of assumptions documentation is not very 
sophisticated, but as with many things in financial modeling, the simple 
solution is often best. As you can see in Figure 4-3, the assumption has been 
simply typed into the cell below the calculation table. There is no danger here 
that a modeler or user might overlook this assumption, whether it’s being 
viewed on the computer or in a printout.
»
» Linked dynamic text: Documenting assumptions liberally within your model 
is very important, but it’s very difficult to keep the documentation up-to-date 
when your model is dynamic and inputs are continually changing. For 
example, in the project costings model shown in Figure 4-4, you want to make 
sure that the person using the model understands that only 15 hours has 
been entered into the model, so you want to put the commentary below 
“Calculations based on 15 hours of billable time spent.” This seems fairly 
obvious in this example, but if the model were more complex, and the inputs 
were on a different page, it would be useful to include this comment.
If you were to simply type the text “Calculations based on 15 hours of billable 
time spent” manually into cell A10, this would be correct . . . until someone 
FIGURE 4-3: 
Hard-coded text.

54      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
changes the number of billable hours spent on the project, and then the text 
would quickly become out-of-date. There is a very high risk in this case that 
you could distribute the model with incorrect assumption documentation.
Instead of typing in the hard-coded value of 15, you can convert the text to a 
dynamic formula using an ampersand (&), as shown in Figure 4-4. If this 
formula is used, it will automatically change if the value in C2 changes:

the value 15 in cell C2 to another value, such as 20, and you’ll see that text 
changes from “Calculations based on 15 hours of billable time spent” to 
“Calculations based on 20 hours of billable time spent.”
Create Dynamic Formulas Using Links
In financial modeling, you need to understand the difference between linked and 
hard-coded numbers. A linked number will automatically change when the source 
data changes. In Figure 4-5, cell C3 contains the formula =B3*$C$2. This means 
FIGURE 4-4: 
Linked  
dynamic text.

CHAPTER 4  Building a Financial Model by the Rulebook      55
that if, say, the number of hours spent on the project in cell C3 changes from 15 to 
20, the cost of the team leader will change from $1,200 to $1,600. If you want to 
try this out for yourself, you can download File 0401.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/
financialmodelinginexcelfd and select the tab labeled 4-5.
In comparison, cells C2 and cells B3 to B6 contain hard-coded numbers. These are 
simply typed directly into the cell and won’t change unless a user manually 
changes them. These cells can also be called input cells because if a user or modeler 
changes them, it will change the model output calculations.
Format cells containing hard-coded numbers differently so that it’s obvious to the 
user which cells can be changed and which cannot. By formatting input cells dif-
ferently, it’s a signal to your user or another modeler that this is a hard-coded 
input variable that is designed to change if necessary. Excel has helpfully provided 
an Input style on the Home tab, as shown in Figure 4-6. There is no hard-and- 
fast rule that says that you must use this particular format, but it’s important that 
you do use a consistent format throughout your model so that the user can see at 
a glance which cells should be changed, and which should not.
This process of linking calculation cells to input cells is an important concept in 
financial modeling. Always link as much as possible so that when the model inputs 
change, the outputs also change. The only hard-coding should be input cells. To find 
out more about linking between cells, sheets, and external files, see Chapter 6.
FIGURE 4-5: 
Formulas versus 
hard-coded 
numbers.

56      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
By linking, you can trace source data back through the links, making your model 
auditable, traceable, and easy to validate. If you got the input from somewhere, 
you should document where it came from wherever possible, because that will 
help with auditing and validation, and give your model credibility.
Only Enter Data Once
When entering data, you should document where it came from if possible, and 
then link to it with formulas. This may sound obvious but be careful never to enter 
the same value twice  — enter it once as a source and always reference that  
one cell.
During a long and complex model build, it’s very easy to forget that you’ve entered 
certain assumptions or inputs, and then enter them again in a different part of the 
model. For example, in my intermediate online financial modeling course, we 
build a business case from start to finish, during which we use inflation multiple 
times within the model, both for indexing salaries, as well as increasing the rev-
enue charged to the customers. Because we’ve entered the inflation in a single cell 
on the assumptions page, and then referred to it multiple times throughout the 
model, any fluctuation in the interest rate can be quickly and easily applied 
throughout the model.
Never type a value within a formula. A calculation such as =453*24 should not 
appear in a financial model. Similarly, a statement such as =IF(H$6<=$E7,0,157000) 
should have a link, not 157000 typed in. The only exceptions to this rule are those 
things that are standard or commonly accepted values that will not change, such 
as 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, or 12 months in a year. In fact, some hard-
core modelers even say that you should put the value 12 in a separate cell, and then 
link to that cell as an assumption that there are 12 months in the year, but I think 
that’s taking it a bit far!
FIGURE 4-6: 
Input style on the 
Home tab.

CHAPTER 4  Building a Financial Model by the Rulebook      57
Try to link directly to the source data where possible. If you link to a link, this cre-
ates spaghetti links within your model, which can cause problems later on. To find 
out more about spaghetti links, turn to Chapter 14.
Model with Consistent Formulas
If you’re getting a model audited by a third party, one of the many things they’ll 
check for is the number of unique formulas in the model. A good modeler will cre-
ate as few unique formulas as possible as he’s building a model. In the following 
example, I’m calculating portfolio returns of different amounts. Figure 4-7 shows 
the formulas, rather than the calculated values. The way this block has been cre-
ated in this instance, nine different formulas have been used, which is a very slow 
and inefficient way of creating this calculation block.
Download File 0401.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd 
and select the tab labeled 4-7 or simply open Excel, re-create this example and try 
it out for yourself. You’ll see that creating the formulas shown in Figure 4-7 is a 
slow and tedious process.
If the formulas aren’t all showing when you download and open this file, click the 
Show Formulas button in the Auditing group on the Formulas tab in the Ribbon. 
Or, you can use the Ctrl+` shortcut (the ` symbol can be found to the left of the 1 on 
most keyboards, under the ~ sign).
FIGURE 4-7:

portfolio returns 
using nine unique 
formulas.

58      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
The task is made much simpler by merely including a few dollar signs in the for-
mula in cell B2 and then copying. Using one single formula and then copying it 
across and down the calculation block, as shown in Figure 4-8, is much quicker 
and less prone to error.
Using mixed referencing within the formula — by putting a dollar sign before the 
row or column to be anchored — is a far more efficient way of modeling. For more 
information about how to use relative, absolute, and mixed cell referencing, and 
for step-by-step instructions for completing this example, see Chapter 6.
This concept of building your models with consistent formulas wherever possible 
saves time, avoids error, and is much easier to audit. And it’s a key component of 
good financial modeling. If you only pick up one modeling technique from this 
book, this is it!
Modelers should strive for consistency of formulas within models for all the rea-
sons I outline in this section, but consistency, in general, is something to aim for 
in all aspects of the model build. Use consistent colors and formatting, consistent 
labels, and even consistent layouts. If sheets are similar, work on the sheet until 
you’re completely happy with the layout, and then copy the sheet. This way, the 
design, formatting, and layout will be identical. Then when you need to update it, 
group the sheets to make global changes. Have columns and rows matching on 
multiple sheets — for example, on calculation sheets, if January’s calculations 
start in column F, then January should always start in column F on every calcula-
tion sheet.

CHAPTER 4  Building a Financial Model by the Rulebook      59
Build in Error Checks
Even if you’ve only just started modeling, you’re probably well aware how easy it 
is to make a mistake in a financial model! There are three ways to prevent errors 
in a financial model:
»
» Avoid making the mistakes in the first place. In this book, I describe 
several techniques that you can employ to avoid making mistakes in the first 
place, such as being consistent with your formulas.
»
» Check the model for errors. Despite your best efforts, errors inevitably may 
slip through, so check, double-check, and have someone else check your 
model after it’s complete.
»
» Include error checks. As you’re building the model, include error checks that 
prevent inadvertent errors from slipping into the model due to incorrect 
entries or user error.
For more examples of different types of commonly made mistakes, and some 
ways to avoid making these errors in your models, see Chapter 13. This section 
focuses on the first two points: techniques for model building to reduce error, as 
well as ways to check the model for errors.
Error checks are a critical part of a well-built financial model so that the user or 
modeler can see at a glance if the formulas are calculating correctly. For example, 
when creating management reports, check that the sum of each individual depart-
ment’s report adds to the company-wide total. This can be done by inserting a 
simple IF function, among other methods.
In the example shown in Figure 4-9, a capital budget has been built with esti-
mated spend dates in column E. In the capital spend schedule shown in columns 
F through Q, the spend gets spread out over the full year. The modeler knows that 
the total capital spend amount of $124,700 shown in cell D17 should be the same 
as the total capital schedule amount shown in cell R17, and if the two amounts do 
not equal each other, then the model is not calculating properly. So the error-
checking cell E1 contains the very simple formula =R17-D17.
In Figure 4-10, you can see that a user has entered an incorrect value in cell E4. 
Feb-20 is not a valid entry because the capital spend schedule only allows for 
dates during 2019. This means that the financial model shown in Figure 4-10 is 
incorrect — the user has entered $124,700 worth of capital expenditure into the 
model, but only $115,700 has been allocated across the year. The number showing 
in cell E1 (9,000) alerts the user to the fact that there is a problem. Download File 
0401.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd and select the 
tabs labeled 4-9 and 4-10 to try triggering this error check for yourself.

60      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
This error check is very simple and quite discreet. To make it more obvious, you 
may prefer to include the description “error check” next to the error checking cell 
in cell D1, which would make it more obvious to the user what has happened when 
the error check is triggered.
The error check shown in Figure 4-10 is my preferred method of error checking, 
because it’s so simple and quick to build. Because it returns a value in the case of 
an error, it may be a little too discreet for your tastes — it doesn’t necessarily alert 
the user immediately that an error had been made. However, it’s certainly quick 
and easy to follow and, for this reason, a fairly common error check favored by 
many modelers.
FIGURE 4-9: 
A simple error 
check.
FIGURE 4-10: 
An error check 
triggered.

CHAPTER 4  Building a Financial Model by the Rulebook      61
If you use this kind of error check, format it using the Comma style (found on the 
Home tab in the Numbers group) and remove the decimal place and format it with 
a red font. This way, the zero won’t show if there is no error, and a red number 
will show if there is an error.
Alternatively, you may prefer the other error checking formula such as =D17=R17, 
which will return the value TRUE if they are the same or FALSE if they aren’t. 
However, this method is also subject to a false error, as shown in the following 
section.
Allowing tolerance for error
=IF(D17<>R17,”error”,0) is a superior error check, but every now and then it can 
return a false error result, even though the values are the same. (See Chapter 7 for 
how to use an IF statement in a formula like this.) This “bug” in an error check is 
caused by the fact that Excel carries calculations to 14 decimal places. After that, 
it truncates the value and can cause a minute discrepancy, which will report an 
error when it’s only 0.00000000000001 off. To avoid this potential issue, you 
could use an absolute value formula, which would allow a tolerance for error. 
=IF(ABS(D17-R17)>1,”error”,0) will allow the values to be off by $1 before it 
reports an error. If you use the ABS function in Excel, this will take the absolute 
value of the result, so it doesn’t matter if it’s a positive or negative number.
There are many variations of this formula. Some modelers prefer to show the 
word OK if the numbers are right, and Check if they aren’t.
Applying conditional formatting  
to an error check
To make the error check even more prominent to the user, consider using condi-
tional formatting to add a rule that makes the entire cell turn red if the error check 
has been triggered. On the Home Tab of the Ribbon, in the Styles group, click the 
Conditional Formatting button. Then hover the mouse over Highlight Cells Rule 
and select Equal To (see Figure 4-11).
When the Equal To dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-12, type the word 
error into the Format Cells that are EQUAL TO box and click OK. By default, it will 
turn the cell to Light Red Fill with Dark Red Text, but you can change this in the 
drop-down box.

62      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Conditional formatting is popular in error checks because it makes the error check 
stand out more when it has been triggered. And, with any luck, the user will real-
ize that there is an error in the financial model. Conditional formatting is not 
limited to error checks — it can be useful for other models where you want to 
draw the user’s attention to abnormalities or highlights in the calculations.

CHAPTER 4  Building a Financial Model by the Rulebook      63
Format and Label for Clarity
Applying appropriate formatting and labeling to financial models is sometimes 
neglected by even experienced financial modelers. You need to include as many 
descriptions and instructions as possible within the model to make it absolutely 
obvious how to use the model and how the calculations work. Don’t assume that 
someone using the model will be able to understand what he’s supposed to do 
with the model, its purpose, and what should be changed when.
Here are some simple formatting rules to follow:
»
» Format input cells differently from calculation cells. (See “Create Dynamic 
Formulas Using Links,” earlier in this chapter.)
»
» Use the correct symbols for currency. If the currency is dollars, format 5000 
as $5,000 for example, or if it’s in euros, format it as €5,000.
»
» Use commas for thousands. This makes your model easier to read and 
prevents mistakes and misinterpretations.
»
» Include a dedicated units column. Make sure the units denoted by the 
amounts in that column are entered into that column’s heading (for example, 
“MWh,” “Liters,” or “Headcount”).
»
» Label your data clearly. It sounds simple, but mixing units (for example, 
mixing apples and oranges, or miles and kilometers) is a common source of 
error in financial modeling, and good formatting and labeling will avoid this.
»
» If you round figures into thousands, show this clearly at the top of the 
row with a descriptive heading. For example, make the column heading 
“Revenue $’000” to avoid confusion and misinterpretation.
»
» Include units or currencies in column and row headings. Where possible, 
each column or row should contain only one type of unit or currency.
»
» Reserve a column for constants that apply to all years, months, or days. 
For example, if growth rate is 5 percent, have that in column D, and then link 
all calculations to column D.

Using Someone Else’s 
Financial Model
A
s a consultant, my favorite scenario is when a client comes to me and asks 
me to build a new model from scratch. This situation does happen every 
now and then, but it’s very rare. Normally, clients have a financial model 
that isn’t working properly, or they need to update their model from last year, or 
they need to change the layout or design of their model. Being able to create my 
own models from scratch every time would be nice, but it’s rarely practical. 
Instead, most of the time, like most modelers, I’m working with inherited 
­models — models I’ve had to take over from someone else.
When you inherit a model, not only do you inherit the inputs, assumptions, and 
calculations the original modeler has entered, but you also inherit their mistakes. 
Using someone else’s model involves taking responsibility for someone else’s 
work, sometimes from people you’ve never even met! If you’re going to be taking 
responsibility for someone else’s model, you need to take it over and make it your 
own. You need to take responsibility for the workings of this model, and you have 
to be confident that the model is working correctly.
In this chapter, you explore some ways of checking, auditing, validating, and, if 
necessary, correcting other people’s models so that you can be confident in the 
models’ results.
Chapter 5

66      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Considering Templates for Building  
a Financial Model
Models are often inherited in the form of templates. Dealing with a model built 
from a template is quite a different prospect than using a model that has been 
purpose-built for the job. In this section, I start by taking a look at why a modeler 
would use templates in the first place. Then I steer you in another direction and 
tell you why.
Why templates can be appealing
If you describe yourself as a “casual” financial modeler, your usual job might be 
something else entirely, but part of your professional and personal life means that 
you need to create a budget or financial statements, or maybe just do some pricing 
calculations. If this is you, you’re probably looking for an easy way to create a 
quick financial model that gives you the results you need. Starting to build a full 
financial model entirely from the ground up, especially when you have no idea 
where to begin, can be rather daunting. Using a template is a very appealing option 
because it requires a much lower initial investment of time and money than 
­building a model yourself.
If the business or situation you’re trying to model is extremely simple and/or your 
business is exactly the same as every other business, you’ll be fine with a template. 
However, most templates are really just a nicely formatted spreadsheet. There is 
a bit more to building a robust, responsive, and accurate financial model than 
plugging a few numbers into a spreadsheet.
If you’re looking for a shortcut to building a financial model, keep in mind what a 
fully functional, dynamic model does that a basic spreadsheet does not. For more 
information about differentiating a model from a spreadsheet, see the section in 
chapter 1 on “Defining Financial Modeling”.
What’s wrong with using templates
When you’re first starting out, a template may be a good way to get going. But 
think of a template as a car with no engine — it looks great on the surface, but 
there’s no performance! Here are a few important features you won’t have when 
you use a template:
»
» Financial models need drivers: What makes a really good financial model is 
its ability to take the business model and represent it financially. Revenues 
and expenses don’t just happen — something occurs that makes that revenue 

CHAPTER 5  Using Someone Else’s Financial Model      67
or expense become a reality. Drivers are absolutely critical in creating a 
financial model that is flexible and scalable. For example, if you were to 
achieve 10 percent market penetration, and your product was priced at $5, 
your revenue would be, say, $100,000 per month. Many templates simply 
show a hard-coded value of $100,000 for revenue, but in your model, you 
need to know exactly what had to happen in order for revenue to be calcu-
lated at $100,000.
Of course, the beauty of this method not only means that investors or other 
users can trace back to see how the revenue is calculated, but you can also 
run scenarios and sensitivity analyses on these inputs. What if penetration 
were 12 percent? What if you decreased the pricing by 10 percent? This sort of 
analysis is virtually impossible with a simple input of $100,000 for revenue.
»
» Customized inputs: A fill-in-the-blanks template has to suit everyone, so in 
order to meet the requirements of virtually any business model, the inputs 
must be kept generic (Revenue Item 1, Revenue Item 2, and so on). Of course, 
you can change the titles of these line items, but what if you have different 
lines of businesses that need to be separated?
Here’s another example: “Office Rent” — a line item often found in a template — 
may not apply to your company. Maybe you bought your building, have a 
mortgage (a liability, not an expense), and need a way to factor in the mortgage 
pay down and interest portion of each payment. An experienced financial 
modeler would have no problem working this into a customized forecast. If 
you’re using a template, you’ll have a hard time getting the template to meet 
your needs. Plus, you’ll probably spend more time manipulating the template  
to meet your needs than you would’ve spent just building it from scratch.
»
» Scalability: Just like that cheap one-size-fits-all shirt you bought from the 
market, your model will probably never fit properly. It’s pretty much guaran-
teed that whatever number of inputs the template designer has chosen won’t 
be exactly what you need. Inserting or deleting rows may seem simple, but 
any Excel modeler knows how deadly that can be. Before you know it, you’ve 
ended up with a model full of dreaded #REF! errors. To avoid this, the 
template designer likely crated a large number of unnecessary rows and 
columns just in case you need them. Most templates contain a huge amount 
of redundant information and unnecessary complexity, which is confusing, 
takes up memory, and is simply poor modeling practice.
»
» Specialized functionality: The standard financial reports have always been 
the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and profit and loss, but there are 
many additional reports that might be useful to your business but not 
necessarily to others. Unfortunately, you won’t find anything beyond stan-
dard, minimum functionality in a template.
You’re not very likely to have much more than very basic scenario analysis 
functionality built into a template. For example, it would be nice to be able to 

68      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
change a few inputs and do a scenario analysis to find out how increasing 
marketing by 10 percent affects the bottom line. A good scenario analysis tool 
built into a financial model is really what makes a model useful, because you 
can easily see what changing not just one variable but multiple variables does 
to the company.
Templates are great for very surface-level projecting, or “back of the envelope” 
calculations where a high level of precision is not required. But if you’re serious 
about your modeling, you’ll want it done correctly and as accurately as possible. 
Finding a template that will meet your specific needs is nearly impossible. Between 
the work you’ll do adjusting it and the frustration you’ll experience using it, you’ll 
wish you’d just built the model from scratch!
Why you should build your own model
Imagine you are working on the due diligence for a potential acquisition by your 
company of a smaller one. Someone else created a model to project the financials 
but has since left, and you’re responsible for the financial model now. Your inves-
tor asks why your sales projections increase so sharply when the expenses do not. 
The answer — “because that’s what the financial model says” — is simply not 
good enough. If you’re responsible for the model, you need to be familiar enough 
to able to answer a question like that — perhaps not off the top of your head, but 
you should be able to understand the drivers of the model to provide a timely and 
insightful answer to these kinds of questions. Blindly accepting the output of a 
model is foolish and extremely dangerous.
Learning from other people’s models is often helpful, but it’s rarely efficient to 
build a model using their templates. Trying to change things becomes difficult when 
a formula doesn’t change in the way you expect it to, and a nuance will come back 
to haunt you because you didn’t understand the financial model to begin with. You 
may think that a template will help you save time, but in the long run, it will end up 
costing you more time and lead to potential error. Although building your own 
model can be time-consuming, you’ll no doubt be far more comfortable with the 
results. Not only will you be able to vouch for the accuracy of the calculations, but 
during the model-building process you’ll improve your modeling and Excel skills.
Never trust someone else’s work, or take the outputs of his model at face value. 
When inheriting a model, your choices are to start over and build your own model 
from the ground up or validate and verify the existing model to the extent that 
you’re comfortable to take responsibility for the calculations. Starting over to 
build your own model from scratch is inefficient and a waste of resources. Unless 
the model is in extremely poor shape, it’s usually far more efficient to use what 
you already have — but leave no cell untouched during the process of validation 
and verification.

CHAPTER 5  Using Someone Else’s Financial Model      69
Inheriting a File: What to Check For
When you’re inheriting someone else’s model, the best-case scenarios is a model 
handover meeting where you can sit down with the person who built it and he can 
take you through all the various moving parts. Unfortunately, this kind of meeting 
is rarely practical. Usually, the original modeler is unavailable and you’re thrown 
in the deep end, having to figure out how the model works on your own. A good 
modeler will have built the model in such a way that it can speak for itself, without 
the need for additional explanation. It will flow logically and have good documen-
tation, labels, and instructions that make it easy to navigate and figure out how to 
use. Any model you build in the future will contain these features, but the model 
you inherit may or may not include them.
In the absence of any training or handover documentation, when you first start 
using someone else’s model, there are a few things to look for when you first open 
up the file.
Meeting a model for the first time
When you open a financial model someone else has given you for the first time, 
take some time to get acquainted with it. If you’re planning to make this model 
your own, and take responsibility for its outputs, you’re going to be spending 
HAVING SOMEONE ELSE BUILD  
A MODEL FOR YOU
You can always hire a consultant to build a financial model for you. If you decide to take 
this route, my advice, as a modeling consultant, is to work closely with the modeler and 
make sure she understands the problem properly before she begins to build the model. 
As she’s building, ask lots of questions and make sure you understand exactly what 
she’s done and why she’s done it. Don’t just blindly accept any of the outputs. Test the 
model rigorously throughout the process. Remember: You’re going to the be one using 
the model and taking responsibility for its outputs in the future, and it’s your job on the 
line if the model doesn’t reflect the situation accurately. Make sure you can make 
changes to the model yourself so that you don’t have to call the consultant back every 
time you need a simple edit.

70      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
quite a bit of time together. Familiarize yourself with the layout and how it’s built. 
In particular, pay attention to the following:
»
» Formatting: Get used to the formatting, and decide whether you’re happy 
with the formats they’ve used, particularly the color scheme, and decide if you 
want to change it. Are all formulas and hard-coded values formatted differ-
ently? Does it match your company colors?
»
» Formulas: Take a look at the formulas. Are they consistent? Do they contain 
any hard coding? A good way to see all the formulas at once is to select Show 
Formulas on the Formula Auditing section on the Formulas tab on the Ribbon, 
or just press Ctrl+`. For more information on formula auditing, see the “Using 
Audit Tools to Find and Correct Errors” section later in this chapter.
»
» Workbook calculations: Most of the time, calculations happen automatically, 
so that when you change something in the model, the formulas change as 
well. Sometimes, however, when a file is very large, or a modeler likes to 
control the changes manually, the calculation has been set to manual instead 
of automatic. I’ve spent many happy hours auditing a formula, wondering why 
the numbers aren’t changing, only to discover that there was nothing wrong 
with the formula at all — the automatic calculation was simply turned off!
To check this setting, choose File ➪   Options. In the Options dialog box, select 
the Formulas section and check that the calculation options at the top of the 
dialog box have been set to automatic instead of manual. Alternatively, a 
quicker way to access these settings is from the Calculation section of the 
Formulas tab on the Ribbon. Select the Calculation Options button and you 
can switch between manual and automatic calculation from the drop-down 
options that appear. If you see “Calculate” in the status bar in the lower-left 
corner of the screen, you know that the workbook is set to manual calculation.
»
» Error checking: An easy way to see at a glance whether there are any Excel 
errors in a sheet is to press the Error Checking button in the Formula Auditing 
section of the Formulas tab of the Ribbon. This will look across the entire 
sheet and alert you to an Excel error values that you should be aware of. See 
Chapter 13 for more information on what kind of errors you might encounter 
and how to handle them.
»
» Named ranges: Many models contain named ranges, which is not a problem, 
but they often harbor errors due to redundant names and external links. 
Review the named ranges in the Name Manager, which is on the Formulas tab 
of the Ribbon, and delete any named ranges that contain errors or links to

of named ranges in a financial model, see Chapter 6.

Inspecting the workbook
Excel has a fantastic tool called Inspect Workbook that’s a great way of getting to 
know the hidden features of your model and identifying potentially problematic 
features that would otherwise be very difficult to find.
To use Inspect Workbook, press File. On the Info tab, click the Check for Issues 
button, as shown in Figure 5-2.

Manager showing

ranges containing

72      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
The text under Inspect Workbook will tell you immediately the potential issues 
you should know about. Then under the Check for Issues button, there are three 
options to choose from: Inspect Document, Check Accessibility, and Check 
Compatibility.
Inspect Document
This feature is by far the most useful when it comes to checking inherited files. It 
checks for the sorts of things that can cause problems for you if you’re planning 
to use this file in the future. The great thing about it is that it checks all these 
items in one go — you don’t have to go in and check each item one at a time.
When you select Inspect Document, you’re prompted to save the file. Click yes, 
and the Document Inspector dialog box (shown in Figure 5-3) appears. This dialog 
box lists all the things the Document Inspector can check for. Leave all the check 
boxes selected, and click Inspect.
After you’ve clicked Inspect, any potential issues will be flagged, as shown in 
­Figure 5-4. Scroll down the list and take a look at anything that has been flagged. 
You can decide whether you’d like to remove the features from the workbook here 
and now, or ignore them and come back to it later.

The Document 
Inspector 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 5  Using Someone Else’s Financial Model      73
The inspect workbook feature is great for identifying problem-causing features in 
your model. It’s not that helpful for resolving them. It provides a summary of all 
the items the tool has found, and it gives you the option to remove these immedi-
ately from the workbook. This is not a good idea. Instead of simply stripping a 
whole lot of features (and accompanying data) from your model, take the time to 
understand what each of the features is, think about why the modeler might have 
included them in the model, and whether you need them going forward.
For example, the tool may discover that there are hidden sheets in the file. If so, it 
gives you the option to delete those sheets immediately without looking at them. 
The sheets probably contain important information, and your formulas may link 
to cells in those hidden sheets, so accepting the recommendations of the Docu-
ment Inspector will very likely cause more problems than it solves.
If you do remove features through the Document Inspector, there is no Undo 
option. Make sure you save a copy of the file first, just in case!
Another use of the Document Inspector is to remove additional information before 
passing on a file to someone else — sort of like selling your old cellphone on eBay 
and making sure all personal information is removed first.
Table 5-1 lists the potentially problematic features the Document Inspector checks 
for. If the Document Inspector finds any of these features, refer to this table to 
find out why you need to be concerned about each item and what to do about 
them.

TABLE 5-1 
Inspect Document Features
Feature
Why It Matters
What to Do about It
Comments and 
annotations
Quickly find any comments a 
previous author has included. This 
might include any instructions or 
documentation about model 
inputs or assumptions on how it 
has been calculated that you 
need to know.
Read any instructions another modeler 
may have left for you.
Document properties 
and personal 
information
Every file contains “metadata” 
such as the name of the author, 
last saved data, and file path and 
so on, which is all useful 
information, especially when you 
don’t know where the 
model has been.
See who built the model originally, see 
when it was last saved, and make sure 
you’re using the latest version.
Data model
If you’ve used the data model 
(which is unlikely unless you’re 
using Power Pivot), it will check for 
embedded data not visible on 
the sheets.
Take note if these exist.
Content add-ins
Unless you know specifically what 
the add-in is doing, you should 
remove it.
The easiest way to remove it is to allow the 
Document Inspector to remove it.
Task pane add-ins
Unless you know specifically what 
the add-in is doing, you should 
remove it.
The easiest way to remove it is to allow the 
Document Inspector to remove it.
PivotTables, PivotCharts, 
cube formulas, slicers, 
and timelines
You might not realize that the 
model contains PivotTables and 
related features. This is important 
because PivotTables don’t refresh 
automatically the way 
formulas do.
Be sure to refresh any PivotTables, make 
sure they’re still accurate, and ensure that 
any slicers or timelines still work properly. 
Remove them if no longer needed.
Embedded documents
Someone may have embedded 
files within the document. It’s an 
unusual practice, but if they’re 
there, you probably want to 
know about it.
Open the embedded document to see if it 
contains information you need.
Macros, forms, and 
ActiveX controls
These contain executable code, 
and if they’re contained in the 
model, you’ll want to know about 
it. I don’t advocate the use of these 
tools unless absolutely necessary. 
Keeping models as simple as 
possible is important, and these 
tools are quite difficult for the 
casual modeler to use.
Find out what these tools are doing in the 
model, and remove them if no longer 
necessary. The code might be critical for 
model functionality so you should get an 
expert who knows VBA (the macro coding 
language) to take a look before you remove 
it. Saving the file in XLSX format instead of 
XLSM will remove any executable code.

CHAPTER 5  Using Someone Else’s Financial Model      75
Feature
Why It Matters
What to Do about It
Links to other files
These are dangerous because if 
the source file changes, the data 
could change in your model 
without your realizing it.
To see if links exist in your model, select 
Edit Links from the Connections section of 
the Data tab in the Ribbon. The Edit Links 
dialog box will display a list of all external 
links in the file. If links exist, check to see if 
they’re accurate and still necessary. If not, 
remove them by selecting the link in the 
Edit Links dialog box, and pressing Break 
Link. This will quickly convert all cells 
containing external links to their hard-
coded values throughout the model.
Real Time Data 
(RTD) functions
The RTD functions will refresh 
data automatically from real-time 
data servers into Excel, such as 
stock prices.
Locate them by searching for RTD within 
the sheets’ formulas. Review the accuracy 
of the formula and delete if no longer 
necessary.
Excel surveys
Someone may have created an 
online survey that feeds into your 
model. The questions may be 
entered in Excel Online, but not 
visible in the workbook. If a survey 
is there, you’ll want to know that 
that’s where your data is 
coming from.
Test the form and make sure it’s still 
working. Remove the survey functionality if 
it’s no longer needed. The easiest way to 
remove this is to allow the Document 
Inspector to remove it.
Defined scenarios
Scenario Manager may have been 
used on this model, and all the 
scenario information may be 
stored in the scenario and may 
not be visible on the sheet.
Select Scenario Manager from the What-if 
Analysis button on the Forecast section of 
the Data tab. You can view the scenarios 
separately, or click Summary to see a 
summary of all the inputs and outputs that 
have been saved in the Scenario Manager. 
If scenarios are needed, consider using an 
alternative method of scenario analysis 
(see Chapter 8 for more information on 
scenarios).
Active filters
If filters have been activated, some 
data is not visible on the sheet. 
This can cause problems when 
using formulas or copying and 
pasting. For example, you might 
add up a list of items, not realizing 
that a filter has been applied and 
that you aren’t looking at the 
entire list.
The filters won’t cause you any problems 
unless they’re applied, so there is no need 
to remove them entirely. Clear the filters  
by selecting Clear from the Sort & Filter 
section on the Data tab. This way you can 
apply the filters in future if needed.
Custom worksheet 
properties
Someone may have customized 
the worksheet properties. Unless 
you know specifically why he’s 
done it, you should remove it.
The easiest way to remove custom 
worksheet properties is to allow the 
Document Inspector to remove it.

Check Accessibility
This option checks to see whether people with disabilities might have trouble 
accessing any of the features of the file. For example, all visuals and tables should 
have alternative text to help people who can’t see the screen understand the 
image.
TABLE 5-1 (continued)
Feature
Why It Matters
What to Do about It
Hidden names
If hidden names exist in your 
model, they’re unlikely to be of 
much use to you. Unless you know 
specifically why someone has 
used them, you should 
remove them.
You can’t manually remove hidden names 
without using VBA, so the easiest way to 
remove them is to allow the Document 
Inspector to remove them.
Custom XML data
Unless you know specifically why 
this is in your model, you should 
remove it.
The easiest way to remove this is to allow 
the Document Inspector to remove it.
Headers and footers
Headers and footers are easily 
missed because they don’t show 
up in the soft copy unless you 
print or print preview.
Choose File ➪ Print to see a print preview. 
Look for headers and footers and check 
whether they contain any important 
information. Click Page Setup toward the 
bottom of the page to change them.
Hidden rows 
and columns
Hidden rows and columns are 
very common and are the cause of 
one of the most common errors in 
financial modeling. Not realizing 
that hidden rows are in the model 
and might be inadvertently 
included or not included in sum 
totals is extremely dangerous. You 
definitely want to know if hidden 
rows or columns are contained in 
the model.
Highlight the row or column before and 
after the hidden one, right-click, and 
choose Unhide to unhide them.
It’s okay to hide rows and columns to tidy 
up the model and not show everything you 
don’t need to see, but it’s better practice to 
use grouping instead. To apply grouping, 
select the entire row or column you want 
to hide, and select Group from the Outline 
section of the Data tab.
Hidden worksheets
Hidden worksheets are less 
dangerous than hidden rows or 
columns, but if you’re taking over 
a model, you’ll want to know 
exactly what’s on the 
hidden sheets.
Right-click one of the sheet tabs at the 
bottom and choose Unhide. You’ll need to 
unhide each hidden sheet separately.
Invisible content
A common cause of invisible 
content is when people copy and 
paste data from a website and 
invisible objects come with it. 
Removing invisible content is 
highly unlikely to cause a problem.
To find objects, you can use Go To Special 
(Ctrl+G) and select objects, but the easiest 
way to remove it is to allow the Document 
Inspector to do so.

CHAPTER 5  Using Someone Else’s Financial Model      77
Check Compatibility
This option checks whether the file uses new tools available in this version of 
Excel that aren’t available in previous versions of Excel (see Chapter 2).
If you’re not planning to share the file with anyone using previous versions of 
Excel, you can leave any new features in, but if you aren’t sure what version of 
Excel your users may have, you may want to consider replacing them. For exam-
ple, if you’ve created a waterfall chart using the template that first became avail-
able in Excel 2016, you might want to replace it with a chart using the dummy 
stack or up/down bars method so that users of previous versions of Excel will not 
simply see a blank square where the chart should be. For instructions on how to 
do this, see the article at www.plumsolutions.com.au/waterfalls.
Using Audit Tools to Find  
and Correct Errors
When inheriting a model, there are several factors to come to grips with: the layout, 
design, formatting, assumptions, and formulas. Of all these, following the formula 
calculations is the most difficult, and verifying and validating formulas can be very 
time-consuming. The fastest way to understand a formula when you see it for the 
first time is to go into Edit mode. Double-click a cell, or select it and press F2. If the 
formula’s source inputs are on the same page, they’ll show visually where the 
source data is coming from that feeds the cell calculation, as shown in Figure 5-5. 
The color codes are helpful; each range in the formula will be the same color as the 
highlight source data that feeds it. If you’d like to try this out for yourself, down-
load File 0501.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd. 
Open it and select the tab labeled 5-5.
When you’re in Edit mode and you decide that you need to change the range the 
formula is referring to, you can use the mouse to click and drag the colored lines 
to reference a different cell. For example, in Figure 5-5 if you wanted the range 
B3:B12 to be A3:A12 instead, click the colored line showing between the A and B 
column and drag it so that the cell reference is column A instead of column B.
On the Formulas tab in the Ribbon, there is a formula auditing section that con-
tains a number of tools that you’ll find useful when trying to understand someone 
else’s financial model. Just remember that using these audit tools in Excel is not 
the same as performing a formal financial model audit.

78      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
A formal financial model audit is a very detailed process in which a model auditing 
team takes the model apart and checks it meticulously for errors. If the bank is 
lending you money based on the results of the financial model, one of the condi-
tions of the loan might be that the model be audited to make sure that the results 
can be relied upon. Getting a model professionally audited can be an extremely 
expensive undertaking, but it’s really the only way to ensure that there are no 
errors. Note that a financial model audit is sometimes called a model review to dif-
ferentiate it from a financial audit.
Of course, creating your own financial model is a lot more interesting than check-
ing someone else’s. But Excel’s audit tools make checking someone else’s model 
somewhat easier. Formula errors are the most common type of error in financial 
models, and the audit tools exist almost solely for the purpose of finding these 
formula errors.
Checking a model for accuracy
The formula auditing tools can help get to the root of what’s causing the error in 
a cell through tracing relationships among cells within your worksheet. These 
tools will help you find the source of an error, but they’ll also, more important, 
help you find an error you didn’t know was there. By tracing the relationships, 
formula auditing lets you test formulas to see the precedents (cells that directly 
supply the formulas) and the dependents (the cells that depend on the results of 
the formulas). Excel also offers a way to visually reverse any potential sources of 
an error in the formula of any particular cell.
FIGURE 5-5: 
Using Edit mode 
to see formula 
inputs.

CHAPTER 5  Using Someone Else’s Financial Model      79
The formula auditing tools can be found in the command buttons located in the 
Formula Auditing group on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon. These command but-
tons include the following:
»
» Trade Precedents/Trace Dependents: In trying to understand a model, you’ll 
spend the majority of your time working through the formulas and making 
sure you understand exactly how each output has been calculated. Trace 
Precedents and Trace Dependents are good places to start when you’re trying 
to see where the cell links are coming from and going to. These tools are 
helpful to identify the linkages that exist between the cells and display the 
relationships visually with blue tracer line arrows.
To use Trace Precedents, start with an output cell that contains a formula you 
want to understand, such as the formula =SUM(B3:B7) in cell B8 in Figure 5-6. 
Select the cell and click the Trace Precedents button in the Formula Auditing 
section of the Formulas tab. This displays blue tracer line arrows, which show 
which cells B8 depends on.
Using the same cell, you can see which cells, in turn, depend upon B8 by using 
Trace Dependents, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Click the Trace Precedents or Trace Dependents button again, and it goes 
further and shows the precedent of the precedent, or the dependent of the 
dependent.
FIGURE 5-6: 
Trace Precedents.

80      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
If the source data is located on another sheet, instead of the blue tracer line 
arrow, a black dotted line appears with the worksheet icon, as shown in 
Figure 5-8.
Cells that are the cause of errors will show as red tracer arrows instead of 
blue. When the cell links to external files, the source file must be open so that 
the Formula Auditing tool can trace these dependencies.
FIGURE 5-7: 
Trace 
­Dependents.
FIGURE 5-8: 
The black dotted 
line indicates a 
link to an 
off-sheet source.

CHAPTER 5  Using Someone Else’s Financial Model      81
The tracer lines disappear when the file is saved. You can manually remove 
them by clicking Remove Arrows under the Trace Dependents button on the 
Ribbon. Make sure you remove the arrows before printing the sheet; other-
wise, they’ll show up in the printed document.
You can also jump to precedent cells by using these shortcuts:
•	 Ctrl+[ to jump to and highlight precedent cells
•	 Ctrl+] to jump to and highlight dependent cells
•	 Ctrl+G or F5 and then Enter to return to the previous cell
DEALING WITH REDUNDANT ASSUMPTIONS
A common problem in financial models, particularly “legacy models” that have been 
around for a long time and have been passed on from one staff member to another, is 
that inputs and assumptions may exist that aren’t actually being used in the model’s 
­calculations. Redundant assumptions can happen when modelers need to use source 
information that is already in the spreadsheet and re-create it without realizing that 
they’re entering a duplicate set of assumptions or data. Often, as a model evolves, parts 
of the model calculations are deleted, but the assumptions that fed into those calcula-
tions remain, despite the fact that they’re no longer needed. Using the Trace Dependents 
formula auditing tool is the easiest way to see if any formulas are linking to an input cell. 
This tool will allow you to trace forward and backward throughout the model.
One technique you can use to remove redundant cells is to color-code all the input 
assumption and calculation cells. Then go to the model outputs and trace back the formu-
las, using trace precedents and trace dependents. As each input assumption is validated, 
change the color of the input cells back to their original color. At the end of the process, if 
any cells are still colored, you’ll know that they’re redundant and they can be deleted.
When removing redundant inputs from a model, delete entire rows or columns by right-
clicking and selecting Delete Row or Delete Column instead of selecting the cell and 
pressing Delete. This way, if the deletion had been linking to a formula, you see an 
error. Clearing cells simply changes the value to zero, which won’t necessarily return an 
error and can cause undetected errors to remain in the model.
Formula auditing doesn’t always show up if certain tools such as data tables, array for-
mulas, and the INDIRECT and OFFSET are relying on that cell. For this reason, make sure 
you save before deleting any redundant assumptions in your model and check the 
output of the model for #REF! or other errors before continuing. If removing the cells 
has caused an error, you can simply undo or close without saving to revert to the 
­version of the file prior to the changes.

82      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
Making sense of the formulas
Of the tools that are contained within the Formula Auditing section of the Formu-
las section on the Ribbon, Trace Precedents and Trace Dependents are most likely 
to be the most useful. There are a few other tools, however, which also warrant a 
mention.
»
» Evaluate Formula: Another way of checking formulas is to actually take them 
apart using the Evaluate Formula tool. This tool is most useful with long and 
complex nested formulas because it evaluates each part of the formula 
separately in the current cell that you’re in, as shown in Figure 5-9.
You can also evaluate a partial formula manually by selecting a part of the 
formula and pressing F9. You have to select an entire section of the formula 
that makes sense in its own right; for example, in a nested formula such as 
=IFERROR(IF(E3<$F$1,-E3/D3,0),0), shown in Figure 5-10, you can select this 
portion of the formula: E3<$F$1. If you then press F9, the result of that 
portion of the formula alone will be displayed as a value, which in this case is 
FALSE. You can see that the statement being evaluated is false, so the “value if 
true” part of the formula will be the result of the statement, rather than the 
“value if false.” (For more information on using IF statements, see Chapter 7.)
FIGURE 5-9: 
The Evaluate 
Formula tool.

» Error checking tools: If you make a mistake — or what Excel thinks is a 
mistake — a green triangle will appear in the upper-left corner of the cell. This 
happens if you omit adjacent cells, such as the error that is shown in Figure 5-11, 
or if you enter an input as text that looks like it should be a number.
FIGURE 5-10: 
Auditing part of 
the formula 
manually.
FIGURE 5-11: 
Error checking.

84      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
In this instance, Excel provides a very helpful notification that the formula in 
cell B8 does not include the entire range above it, which is highly likely to be 
an error. This menu gives you various options to help correct the error.
This error checking feature adheres to a number of rules that Excel uses to 
correct errors, or what it defines as errors, such as inconsistent formulas, cells 
omitted from a formula, or numbers entered as text. Cells that contravene 
these rules will trigger the error checking feature and be marked with a green 
indicator.
Although this error checking feature is often helpful, many modelers find it 
irritating, so you can turn it off or edit its rules by selecting the Error Checking 
Options at the bottom of the menu shown in Figure 5-11. The Excel Options 
box, shown in Figure 5-12, appears. There, you can turn off the error checking 
entirely by unchecking the Enable Background Error Checking option, or 
change the errors it alerts you to by changing the options in the Error 
Checking Rules section at the bottom of the dialog box.
Another part of Excel’s error checking feature can be accessed via the Error 
Checking or Trace Error options, also in the Formula Auditing section on the 
Formulas tab in the Ribbon. As shown in Figure 5-13, the error checking 
option will find any Excel errors on the sheet, and then the Trace Error tool will 
apply Trace Precedents to find the source of the error.
FIGURE 5-12: 
The Excel Options 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 5  Using Someone Else’s Financial Model      85
»
» Watch window: Another tool in the Formula Auditing section of the Formulas 
tab in the Ribbon is the Watch window. If you have output cells you’d like to 
keep an eye on, this tool displays the result of specified cells in a separate 
window. The Watch window is useful for testing formulas to see the impact of 
a change in assumptions on a separate cell or cells.
For example, in the integrated financial model you create in Chapter 12, you 
can add a watch to the ending cash flow. As shown in Figure 5-14, select the 
cell you want to monitor — in this case, cell N42 on the IS Cash Flow sheet. 
Click the Formulas tab in the Ribbon and then select the Watch Window button 
in the Formula Auditing section. When the Watch Window dialog box appears, 
click Add Watch, as shown in Figure 5-14, and then click the Add button.
FIGURE 5-13: 
The Error 
Checking tool.
FINDING CIRCULAR REFERENCES
If you inadvertently link a formula to itself somehow, this will cause a circular reference, 
which is a form of error because Excel doesn’t know how to calculate it. For more infor-
mation on what causes circular references and how to correct them, turn to Chapter 14.
If you know that circular references are causing problems in your model, the Error 
Checking tool has a quick way to find all the offending circular references in the model. 
Under the Error Checking drop-down arrow in the Formula Auditing section of the 
Formulas tab on the Ribbon, as shown at the top of Figure 5-13, under the Trace Error 
you see a Circular References option. If circular references exist in your model, the 
Circular References icon will no longer be grayed out.

86      PART 1  Getting Started with Financial Modeling
The current value of $19,624 appears in the Watch window. This window 
remains onscreen no matter where you go in the model, and always shows 
you the current value. This tool is particularly useful in sensitivity analysis. For 
example, by going to the Assumptions page and changing the consumables 
cost from 45 cents to 50 cents, the value in the Watch window changes from 
$19,624 to $18,567, as shown in Figure 5-15. You can see this in the Watch 
window easily without having to jump backward and forward in the model to 
see how input changes impact the model’s outputs.

» Show Formulas: If you want to look at all the formulas and not the resulting 
values, you can use the Show Formulas option in Excel. This is also a very quick 
and easy way to see if any hard-coded values exist. For example, in Figure 5-16, 
you can see that there are hardcoded “/12” values in rows 20 and 21.
Note that Show Formulas can also be applied using the Ctrl+` shortcut. (Note 
that ` is usually located on the ~ key at the upper-left of the keyboard.)

SHARING YOUR WORK
When you’ve spent a lot of time building a financial model, you take pride in your work 
and want to “own” the entire model. Your instinct might be to keep the model to your-
self, and not let anyone mess things up. This approach doesn’t work very well in a cor-
porate environment, however. Modeling should be a collaborative, team effort. You 
should build models in such a way that others can understand, edit, use, and interpret 
the results.
This book is focused on making you a good financial modeler — one who knows how to 
build a financial model that others can easily follow. As a model user, however, you 
don’t always know where the model has come from and whether the model builder has 
built the model well. The tools outlined in this chapter enable you to take apart, validate, 
and verify models you’ve inherited so that you can use them with confidence.

Excel Tools and 
Techniques for 
Financial Modeling
W
hen you’re using Excel for the purpose of financial modeling, much of 
the emphasis is on selecting the right function to include in the formu-
las to calculate the results of the model. Besides functions, a number of 
tools and techniques are also useful to include in your models. Chapter 7 focuses 
on Excel formulas. This chapter looks at some of the other practical tools and 
techniques commonly used in financial modeling in Excel.
Referencing Cells
In Chapter  3, I explain why not every spreadsheet built in Excel is a financial 
model. In order to be able to call your spreadsheet a financial model, it must 
Chapter 6

92      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
contain formulas. And in order to build formulas, you need to reference cells. It 
follows therefore that as a financial modeler, you must understand how to refer-
ence cells in Excel.
An Excel worksheet is made up of over a million rows and more than 16,000 
­columns. Each of these cells is referred to like the coordinates of a map, and the 
cell references are what you use to build the formula. For example, in Figure 6-1, 
the cost of $450 has been entered in cell B2. So, if you want to use that value in 
another cell, you would use the cell reference =B2.

This kind of reference is called a relative cell reference, and it’s the default way that 
Excel treats the reference when you first link to a cell. There are three types of cell 
references, however, and the way you choose to reference a cell will depend on 
how you want your formula to change when you copy it to other cells:
»
» Relative cell reference: Both the column letter and the row number change 
relative to where the formula is copied. A relative cell reference is simply a cell 
name, such as B2.
»
» Absolute cell reference: The column letter and row number of a cell name 
are preceded by dollar signs, such as $B$2, to indicate that the cell reference 
should not change when copied.
FIGURE 6-1: 
Cell referencing.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      93
»
» Mixed cell reference: Either the column letter or row number is preceded by 
a dollar sign to indicate which of these is to remain unchanged when copied. 
Both $B2 and B$2 are examples of mixed cell references.
Understanding the difference between relative, absolute, and mixed cell referenc-
ing is important when it comes to efficiently building your financial models and 
maintaining formula consistency. Formula consistency is critical for best practice 
in financial modeling (and in any other sort of analysis using Excel). In order to 
have consistent formulas across and down the block of data, you need to under-
stand how cell referencing works. Although cell referencing is a very basic feature 
of Excel that is taught in introductory Excel courses, it’s surprising how many 
modelers don’t recognize its importance.
The dollar sign in cell referencing tells Excel how to treat your references when 
you copy the cell. If there is a dollar sign in front of a row number or column let-
ter, the row or column does not change when you copy it. Otherwise, it does 
change. So an absolute reference will not change its cell reference when you copy 
it, whereas a relative reference will.
I walk you through each of these types of cell referencing in greater detail in the 
following sections.
Relative cell referencing
Relative cell referencing is the default in Excel. For example, Figure 6-2 calculates 
the total price by referring to values in cells B2 and A3. The asterisk is used to 
multiply the numbers in the two cells.
FIGURE 6-2: 
Relative cell 
referencing.

94      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Although you can manually type out a cell reference, this may introduce hard-to- 
detect typing errors. To avoid this problem, enter your cell reference by typing the 
formula up to the point of the cell reference and then select the cell with the value 
to be used in your formula. You can do this by clicking the cell with your mouse or 
using the arrow keys on your keyboard. When you select a cell, Excel automatically 
places the cell name in your formula.
When you copy a formula with relative references to the cell below, the row num-
ber of the references adjust accordingly. In the same way, when you copy the 
formula to the next cell over, the column letters changes. For example, when the 
formula in cell B3 is copied down the range, the references automatically change, 
as shown in Figure 6-3, and the results will be wrong!
To get the correct result using relative references, you’d need to re-create the 
formula five times instead of copying it down, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Although this does give the correct results, it’s not the fastest and easiest way of 
building this formula. There are several reasons why this solution is not 
recommended:
»
» It takes a lot longer to build.
»
» The formula is prone to error because you’re far more likely to accidentally 
pick up the wrong cell.
»
» Updating it will mean having to update each and every formula in the range.
»
» It’s more difficult for someone else to follow and, hence, more difficult to audit.

reference copied

and not

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      95
Absolute cell referencing
A much better solution would be to use the formula =$B$2*A3 and then copy the 
formula down the range, as shown in Figure 6-5. Putting one dollar sign before 
the column letter and another before the row number in the cell reference anchors 
the reference when it’s copied. This is called an absolute reference.
FIGURE 6-4:

reference built

correct but not

FIGURE 6-5:

96      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
In this example, the $B$2 part of the formula is an absolute reference, and the  
A3 part of the formula is a relative reference. As shown in Figure  6-5, the  
absolute reference remains constant, but the relative reference changes when it’s 
copied down.
Let’s take a look at a practical example and apply relative and absolute cell refer-
encing to a very simple financial model. You’ve been given the annual salaries for 
staff members who will work on a particular project. Assume that each person 
works 260 days in the year, and each person must work 60 days on this project. 
Calculate the total staff cost of the project.
Download File 0601.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd 
and select the tab labeled 6-6, or open a blank workbook and enter and format the 
data as shown in Figure 6-6. Then follow these steps:
1.	 In cell C6, enter the formula =B6/B3.
This formula calculates the daily rate of each person by dividing his annual 
salary by the number of days he works per year. The formula result is $923.08.
2.	 Press F4 to apply absolute referencing.
The formula changes to =B6/$B$3.
3.	 Copy this formula down the column.
Now you need to calculate what those project costs are based on the daily rate 
by multiplying the number of project days by the daily rate.
FIGURE 6-6: 
Calculating daily 
staff rate using 
absolute 
referencing.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      97
4.	 In cell D6, enter the formula =D3*C6.
5.	 When you copy it down, you want the project days reference to remain 
constant, so press F4 to fix this reference.
The formula is =$D$3*C6 with the resulting value of $55,385.
6.	 Copy this formula down the column.
7.	 In cell D10, enter the formula =SUM(D6:D9).
The result $146,769, which is the total project cost.
8.	 Compare your results to Figure 6-7.
You can perform some sensitivity analysis by changing the number of project 
days in cell D3 from 60 to 65. Change the cost for the business analyst in cell 
B7 from $120,000 to $150,000. Observe the effect it has on the project costs.
Mixed cell referencing
Mixed cell referencing is a combination of relative and absolute referencing; one 
part of the reference is absolute, and the other is relative. When you add a dollar 
sign before the row, the row remains anchored when the cell is copied; when you 
add a dollar sign before the column, the column remains anchored when the cell 
is copied.
FIGURE 6-7: 
Completed 
project costs.

98      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
For example, if you create the reference =B2 in a cell, and then copy that reference 
down, it will change to B3. If you add some anchoring, here are the results in each 
case:
Cell
Copies as Cell
=B2
=B3
=$B$2
=$B$2
=B$2
=B$2
=$B2
=$B3
The dollar sign anchors a row number or column letter when you copy it. You can 
anchor both the column and the row (absolute referencing), or you can anchor one 
or the other (mixed referencing).
Mixed cell referencing is a concept critical to good financial modeling practice, so 
it’s important for a financial modeler to understand this fundamental concept. 
Used effectively, mixed cell references make your model
»
» Faster to build and more efficient
»
» Less prone to error
»
» Quicker, easier, and cheaper to audit
The easiest way to quickly add absolute and mixed cell referencing is to press F4 
immediately after adding the reference to the formula. This keyboard shortcut 
cycles through combinations of relative and absolute referencing. You can repeat-
edly press F4 after entering the cell name in a formula to cycle through the mixed 
references. For example, type =B2 and then press F4 to display =$B$2. Press F4 
again to display =B$2. Press F4 again to display =$B2. And press F4 again to 
­display =B2.
Let’s look at a practical example of how to use mixed cell referencing. In the follow-
ing example, you want to calculate how much you’d receive in interest under three 
different portfolio amounts and three different interest rates. The most efficient 
way to perform this calculation is to create a single formula with appropriate refer-
ences and then copy that formula to other cells. You need to create a formula that 
multiplies the interest amount in row 1 and the borrowing amount in column A.
Instead of creating nine different formulas, you’re creating only one single formula 
using mixed cell referencing, which you can then copy across, saving you time and 
reducing the possibility of error.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      99
Follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0601.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd and select the tab labeled 6-8 or create a blank workbook and 
enter and format the data as shown in Figure 6-8.
2.	 In cell B2, type = and then select cell A2 by clicking it or pressing the 
arrow key.
3.	 Press F4 three times to display the mixed reference $A2.
4.	 Type *, select cell B1, and this time press F4 twice to display the mixed 
reference B$1.
To anchor the row, put the dollar sign before the row. To anchor the column, 
put the dollar sign before the column.
5.	 Press Enter to show the formula =$A2*B$1 in cell B2.
The result is $18,750 as shown in Figure 6-8.
6.	 Select cell B2 and copy it across and down the rest of the block of data.
Copying and pasting can be done in a several different ways. Choose the 
option that suits you best:
•	 Go to the lower-right corner of cell B2 and select the fill handle with the 
mouse. Drag it across to cell D2 and release the mouse. Then drag down  
to row 4.
FIGURE 6-8: 
Mixed cell 
referencing.

100      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
•	 Copy cell B2 with the shortcut Ctrl+C, and select the entire block either with 
the mouse or by holding down the Shift key together with the right arrow 
and down arrow. Press Enter to paste.
•	 Highlight the entire block of data either with the mouse or by holding down 
the Shift key together with the right arrow and down arrow. Use the 
shortcuts Ctrl+R and Ctrl+D to copy right and copy down.
7.	 Review the results.
Note how your carefully crafted formula generates data for the entire block of 
cells. Compare your worksheet to the one shown in Figure 6-8.
Maintaining consistency of formulas is a fundamental technique of financial 
modeling that will save you and anyone else using your model a lot of unnecessary 
time in building, checking, and auditing the calculations.
When formulas make calculations based on data stored in your spreadsheet, use 
cell references wherever possible, instead of typing the actual data. Typing num-
bers into formulas is called hard coding, and it should be avoided unless the num-
bers are source data — and, if so, documented as such. This rule is also important 
to follow when building your model because it makes your models much easier to 
update, both for you and others using your model. If you’ve used cell references 
instead of hard-coded the numbers into the formula, and you change a value in a 
cell referenced by a formula, the formula automatically recalculates.
Naming Ranges
Many financial modelers like to include named ranges in their models. Named 
ranges are just a way of naming a cell, or a range of cells, to use it in a formula, 
instead of using cell references.
In Figure 6-5 earlier in this chapter, I used an absolute reference to anchor the 
formula to the consistent price of $450. This cell is called B2, and it won’t change. 
However, I can also change the name of it to something else, such as “price.” 
That’s what a named range is.
Understanding why you may want  
to use a named range
You don’t have to include named ranges in a financial model, and some of the best 
financial models don’t use them at all. Those who haven’t used them before 

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      101
sometimes struggle to see the benefits of including them in financial models. 
Most of the time, named ranges aren’t really necessary, but there are a few rea-
sons why you should consider using them in a financial model:
»
» Named ranges can make your formulas easier to follow. A formula 
containing lots of cell references can be confusing to look at and difficult to 
edit. But if the cell references are replaced by a range name, it becomes much 
easier to understand. For example, the formula =SUM(B3:B24)-SUM(F3:F13) 
could be expressed as =SUM(Revenue)-SUM(Expenses) to calculate profit.
»
» Named ranges don’t need absolute referencing. By default, a named range 
is an absolute reference, so you don’t need to add any in.
»
» Using named ranges is ideal when you’re linking to external files. When 
the cell reference in the source file changes (such as when someone inserts a 
row), the formula linking to it will automatically update, even if the file is 
closed when the update is made.
»
» If you decide to use macros in your model, you should use named ranges 
when referring to cell references in the Visual Basic code. As with external 
links, this practice is more robust than using cell references.
In general, named ranges just make your life easier as a modeler. They make your 
formulas neat and tidy, easier to read and follow. You aren’t required to use named 
ranges in your model, but you should know what they are and how to edit them if 
you come across named ranges in someone else’s model.
Creating a named range
To create a named range, follow these steps:
1.	 Select cell B2.
2.	 In the Name box in the upper-left corner (see Figure 6-9), type over the 
name and call it something else, like Price.
Note that the name you type must not contain any spaces or special characters. 
For instance, if you want to call it “Year 1 Price,” you need to name it “Year1Price” 
or “Year1_Price” or something along those lines.
3.	 Press Enter.
Named ranges don’t necessarily need to be confined to a single cell; you can also 
create named ranges for an entire range of cells, and these can be used in formu-
las. Simply highlight the range instead of a single cell, and type over the name.

102      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Finding and using named ranges
Clicking the drop-down arrow next to the Name box shows all the defined names 
in the workbook, as shown in Figure 6-10.
Clicking the name in the drop-down box will take you directly to select that cell or 
range of cells included in the named range automatically. It doesn’t matter what 
sheet you’re in when you select the name. This can make finding your way around 
the named ranges in a model much faster. You can also press Ctrl+G to bring up a 
dialog box with all the names, or press F3 to paste names.
FIGURE 6-9: 
The Name box.
FIGURE 6-10: 
Finding a named 
range using the 
Name box.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      103
After you’ve created a range name, you can use that name in a formula instead of 
cell references. In the example shown in Figure 6-11, you can create the named 
range Price for cell B2 and the named range Units for the range A3:A7. In cell B3, 
you can use the formula =Price*Units to calculate the price, and then copy it down 
the column, as shown in Figure 6-11.
You can use a named range in a formula in several different ways:
»
» Simply type =price in a cell.
»
» Type = and then select cell B2 with the mouse to pick up the name of the cell.
»
» Press F3 and then double-click the name to paste it into a cell.
»
» Select the Formulas tab on the Ribbon and, in the Defined Names section, 
select the name you want to use from the Use in Formula drop-down list.
If you’re planning to use named ranges in your model, create them first, before you 
build your formulas. Otherwise, you’ll need to go back and rebuild your formulas 
to include the named ranges.
A cell does not need to be an input field in order to assign a name to it, although 
it often is in financial models. The cell can also contain a formula as well as a 
hard-coded input value.
FIGURE 6-11: 
Using named 
ranges in a 
formula.

104      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Named ranges can be useful, but you don’t want to have too many. They can be 
confusing, especially if you haven’t been consistent in your naming methodology. 
It’s also quite easy to accidentally name the same cell twice. So in order to keep 
names neat and tidy, be sure to use the Name Manager to edit or delete any named 
ranges that are no longer being used. Note that copying sheets into a model can 
copy named ranges, which can also contain errors as well as external links you’re 
not aware of. This can slow down the file, so it’s a good idea to look through the 
Name Manager every now and then to tidy it up.
Editing or deleting a named range
You can manage all the named ranges you’ve created in the Name Manager, which 
can be found in the Defined Names section on the Formulas tab on the Ribbon.  
It’s easy to create a named range and forget it’s there, so try to keep your names 
tidy. If you need to remove a named range or find that you’ve accidentally named 
the wrong cell, you can add, edit, or delete existing named ranges in the Name 
Manager.
Linking in Excel
As discussed in Chapter 1, the definition of financial modeling is that when the 
inputs change, the outputs change as well. Linking in Excel is what makes this 
happen. If you’re just typing numbers into formulas, such as =453*12, that’s not 
financial modeling. You need to create a formula that links to a cell or cells so that 
when the cell changes, the result of your formula will change as well.
There are two types of links in Excel: internal links (links within the model) and 
external links (links to other files). So far, in this chapter, I’ve been performing 
links on the same page. Almost every financial model involves multiple pages, 
though, so it’s almost always necessary to link to other sheets within the same file.
Internal links
In this section, you have some simple profit-and-loss calculations, and you’re 
going to create a summary report by linking between sheets. Follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0602.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd and select the tab labeled IS.
A completed version is also available in File 0603.xlsx, which you can download 
and use to compare your work.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      105
2.	 On the IS worksheet, select the cell C4 and calculate the sales revenue by 
entering the formula =F3*F4.
The calculated result is $29,502.
3.	 Go to cell C19 and calculate the manufacturing cost by entering the 
formula =F19*F3.
The calculated result is $7,152.
4.	 Go to cell C20 and calculate the sales commission by entering the formula 
=F20*C4.
The calculated result is $1,475.
5.	 Excel will sometimes put additional decimal places automatically, so 
change the number formatting to currency with no decimal places if 
necessary.
You can do this by pressing the Decrease Decimal icon in the Number section 
of the Home tab of the Ribbon.
6.	 Check that the profit margin is calculating correctly.
The calculated result in cell C25 is 20%.
7.	 Compare your results to Figure 6-12.
Now you have your detailed P&L and you can create a summary on the first 
worksheet (Summary) using links.
FIGURE 6-12: 
The completed 
income 
­statement.

106      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
8.	On the Summary worksheet, select cell B5.
9.	Link through the fixed costs by entering the formula =‘IS’!C15.
Do not type this out. Instead, click cell B5, type =, and select the next tab using 
the mouse. Click cell C15 on the IS tab using the mouse, and press Enter.
10.	Similarly, select cell B6 on the Summary worksheet and link through the 
variable costs by adding the formula =‘IS’!C21.
11.	Go to cell B4, and link through the sales revenue by adding the formula 
=‘IS’!C4.
12.	Compare your results to Figure 6-13.
A good layout for a financial model is to have assumptions together on a single 
page, usually at the back. Let’s move the assumptions to a separate sheet at 
the back of the model. Don’t worry — this is a lot easier than it sounds!
13.	Insert a new sheet by clicking the plus sign behind the last tab.
14.	Double-click the tab name, and change Sheet1 to Assumptions.
15.	Go back to the IS worksheet and highlight the area of the sheet that 
contains the assumptions (cells F1:G20).
16.	Press Ctrl+X to cut the data onto the clipboard.
17.	Go to the Assumptions worksheet, select cell A1, and press Ctrl+V or 
press Enter to paste the data to the new sheet.
FIGURE 6-13: 
The completed 
income 
­statement 
summary.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      107
When you have data on the Clipboard, pressing Enter will paste the data  
and remove it from the Clipboard. Pressing Ctrl+V will leave the data on the 
Clipboard in case you want to paste it again. Either technique will work in  
this case.
The formulas in this model work in exactly the same way as they did before we 
moved the assumptions to the new sheet. It’s important that you used cut and 
paste here, not copy and paste, or the links would not have worked properly.
18.	Go back to the Assumptions worksheet and tidy it up. Remove the blank 
rows 5 through 18 by highlighting the rows, right-clicking, and pressing 
Delete.
Now you have a simple but tidy model. It links, it’s clear, it’s straightforward, and 
it’s easy for someone else to understand.
External links
So far, I’ve only been looking at creating links from one cell to another, either on 
the same sheet or on a different sheet within the same file. Sometimes, however, 
the data you want to link to exists in another file, so you need to link from one file 
to another. These are called external links. They’re created in a very similar way to 
internal links; simply type = and then select the cell in the file you want to link to, 
and press Enter. Working with external links isn’t as straightforward as working 
with internal links, however, so it does require a lot more care.
External links can be the cause of many problems, such as broken links, incorrect 
data, and error messages. Your model will be much simpler if you can avoid exter-
nal links, but if you decide to include them, you should do so with caution. Most 
problems happen when users
»
» Change filenames or move the file to another location.
»
» Change the source file sheet name when the file linking to it is closed.
»
» Insert rows or columns in the source file when the file linking to it is closed.
»
» Email files that contain links.
Improving external links with named ranges
One of the main issues with linking to external files is that if users insert or delete 
rows or columns in the source file, or change tab names, this causes errors in the 
files that are linking to it. If you’re lucky, it will show a #REF! error, which you can 
easily find and correct. If you’re not so lucky, it will show a value that looks as 
though it is correct, but is in fact completely wrong.

108      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Imagine that you want to use an interest rate in your financial model, which is 
being generated in another model. This interest rate frequently changes, so you 
decide to create a link, rather than hard-coding the number. This will save you 
time having to update it every time. You create a link from your financial model to 
another source file, using the following link:
=‘C:\Plum Solutions\Clients\Transactions\Files\[Interest Calculations.xlsx]
Sept’!$D$23
If both files are open at the same time, and you insert a row in the Interest  
Calculations.xlsx file, the link will automatically update from $D$23 to $D$24. 
However, if your file is closed, your model will not update. This means that the 
next time you open it, your model will be picking up the wrong cell!
The way around this issue is to create a named range in the source file (for exam-
ple, the word interest), and then if that cell moves in the source file, the cell will 
still retain its name, and the formula in your model will still be correct. See the 
section on “Creating a named range” earlier in this chapter for how to do this:
=‘C:\Plum Solutions\Clients\Transactions\Files\[Interest Calculations.xlsx]
Sept’!interest)
The next time your model tries to update the link, it will look for the name inter-
est, rather than $D$23, and the integrity of the link will be maintained. This is 
why using named ranges when dealing with external links is considered best 
practice: It’s a much more robust way of linking files together.
Don’t use formulas in external links. When linking to an external file, use a simple, 
direct formula such as =‘C:\Work\Plum Solutions\Clients\Transactions\Files\Interest 
Calculations.xlsx’!interest. Using more complex formulas, such as SUMIF, can 
mean that the links show errors unless the files are both open at the same time.
Finding and editing external links
In the Connections group on the Data tab, click Edit Links. The Edit Links dialog 
box, shown in Figure 6-14, appears. Click the Change Source button to tell your 
model the new location of the file it has been linked to.
Another handy use for Edit Links is to break all links in a file. If you’re emailing a 
file, it isn’t recommended that you leave links in it. You could paste the cell values 
one by one, but breaking links will convert every single formula in the entire file 
to their hard-coded values. Click Edit Links, and you’ll be able to select the exter-
nal files and click the Break Links button.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      109
Sometimes your model will have links that simply won’t break! These “phantom 
links” are most commonly the result of links contained in named ranges. Deleting 
the names that contain external links from the Name Manager will remove them 
from your file. If that doesn’t work, other possible reasons could be links in con-
ditional formatting, charts, objects, or PivotTables.
Using Shortcuts
If you’re spending a lot of time modeling in Excel, you can save yourself a lot of 
time by learning some keyboard shortcuts. For example, when copying and past-
ing a cell, you could follow this process:
1.	 Select the cell.
2.	 Right-click with the mouse.
3.	 Select Copy from the contextual menu.
4.	 Highlight the destination range with the mouse.
5.	 Right-click again with the mouse.
6.	 Select Paste from the contextual menu.
FIGURE 6-14: 
The Edit Links 
dialog box.

110      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Alternatively, you could accomplish the same task using shortcuts:
1.	 Select the cell.
2.	 Press Ctrl+C.
3.	 Use the Shift and arrow keys to move to the destination cells.
4.	 Press Enter (which clears the clipboard) or press Ctrl+V (which leaves 
what you have copied on the clipboard).
Open Excel and try this for yourself. The second method is a lot quicker, especially 
with a little practice.
Hundreds of shortcuts are available in Excel. Table 6-1 lists those that are covered 
in this book and that you should, at a minimum, know. As you continue your jour-
ney as a modeler, you’ll no doubt add many more shortcuts to your repertoire.
CHAMPIONSHIP MODELING
Speed and accuracy in financial modeling are critical. Skilled financial modelers are highly 
adept at the use of shortcuts, and watching an expert modeler at work is impressive 
viewing. Every year since 2012, the ModelOff Financial Modeling World Championships 
are held, and the winner is crowned world financial modeling champion. Usually spon-
sored by Microsoft, the championships are held through live online rounds, and a hand-
ful of finalists are flown to New York or London to compete. Each is given modeling 
problems that he or she needs to complete in front of a live audience, a surprisingly 
entertaining spectacle.
Some of the most commonly used shortcuts are located on the top row of the keyboard; 
F2 (edit formula) and F4 (referencing $ toggle) are among the most popular. Strategically 
located between the F2 key and the Esc key is the F1 key, which is rarely helpful but 
often pressed accidentally when trying to press Esc or F1! For ModelOff competitors, 
speed is paramount, and accidentally pressing F1 is very frustrating because it causes 
the modeler to lose valuable seconds. Many ModelOff competitors actually remove the

Restricting and Validating Data
After you finish building a financial model, you may be tempted to keep it to your-
self, because you don’t want anyone to mess up your formulas or use the model 
inappropriately. Models should be collaborative, but you need to build your model 
in such a way that it’s easy for others to use and difficult to mess up. One great way 
of making your model robust for others to use is to apply data validations and pro-
tections to the model. This way, the user can only enter the data he’s supposed to.
Restricting user data entry
For a practical example of how to use data validation, let’s take the Project Cost-
ings Analysis from the “Absolute cell referencing” section earlier in this chapter 
(refer to Figure 6-6). Your colleague is using the model you’ve built and he can tell 
by the way in which cell D3 has been formatted (with shading) that you expected 
people to make changes to it. He’s not sure anymore how many days this project 
is going to continue, so he types TBA into cell D3 instead. As soon as he types TBA, 
that really messes things up! As you can see in Figure 6-16, the formulas you’ve 
already built were expecting a number in cell D3, not text.
Instead of allowing the user to put anything into any cell, you can change the 
properties of this cell to allow only numbers to be entered. You can also change it 
to allow only whole numbers or numbers in a given range.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0601.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd and select the tab labeled 6-17.
2.	 Select cell D3.

114      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
3.	 Go to the Data tab on the Ribbon and press the Data Validation icon in 
the Data Tools section (see Figure 6-17).
The Data Validation dialog box appears (refer to Figure 6-17).
4.	 On the Settings tab, in the Allow drop-down list, select Whole Number; in 
the Data drop-down list, select Greater Than; and in the Minimum field, 
enter 0.
FIGURE 6-17: 
Using data 
validation to 
restrict entry  
into cells.
FIGURE 6-16: 
Text in an input 
causing errors.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      115
Now only allow whole numbers greater than zero can be entered into cell D3. Try 
entering text such as TBA. Try entering a negative value. Excel won’t allow it, and 
an error alert will appear.
If you want, you can enter a warning message on the Input Message tab of the 
Data Validation dialog box. For example, you might want the following message to 
appear: “Warning! Only enter numerical values.” On the Error Alert tab, you can 
enter another message that appears if someone ignores the warning and tries to 
enter invalid text. I’m usually tempted to type something mischievous, such as: 
“Invalid entry. Your hard drive will now be completely erased.”
Creating drop-down boxes  
with data validations
Not only does the data validation tool stop users from entering incorrect data into 
your model, but you can also use it to create drop-down boxes. In the Data Valida-
tion dialog box, from the Allow drop-down list, select List, as shown in Figure 6-18. 
In the Source field, enter the values you’d like to appear in the list with a comma 
between them such as Yes, No. A simple drop-down list is created in cell B12 with 
only two options: Yes and No. The user can’t enter anything else.
No one can enter a value in a cell that goes against your data validation rules, but 
it’s still possible to paste over a cell that is restricted by data validation. In this 
way, users can inadvertently (or deliberately) enter data into your model that you 
did not intend.
FIGURE 6-18: 
Using data 
validation to 
create a simple 
drop-down list.

116      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
You can also create a drop-down list that links to existing cells within the model. 
For example, in Figure 6-19, I don’t want the users to include a region that is not 
included in the list shown in column F. So I’ve used a data validation list, but 
instead of typing in the values (which would be very time-consuming), I can link 
to the range already containing the regions — $F$2:$F$5 — which is a much 
quicker way of inserting a drop-down list.
Because I’ve linked the drop-down list, this drop-down is now dynamic. If some-
one edits any of the cells in the range F2:F5, the options in the drop-down list will 
automatically change.
Protecting and locking cells
You can also add protection to your model by going to the Review tab on the Rib-
bon and clicking the Protect Sheet button in the Changes section. Enter a pass-
word if you want one, and click OK. This will protect every single cell in the entire 
worksheet, so no one will be able to make any changes at all! If you want users to 
be able to edit certain cells, you’ll need to turn off the protection, highlight those 
cells (and only those cells you want to change), go to the Home tab on the Ribbon, 
and click the Format button in the Cells section. Deselect the Lock Cell option that 
appears in the drop-down list. Turn the protection back on again, and only the 
cells that have been selected will be unlocked.
Keep in mind that it’s reasonably easy to crack an Excel password (search the 
Internet for Excel password cracker), so if someone wants to get in and make 
changes to your protected model, he can. I recommend that you treat Excel pass-
words as a deterrent, not a definitive security solution.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      117
Goal Seeking
Another tool that’s very useful for financial modeling is goal seek. If you know the 
answer you want, but you want to know what input you need to achieve it, you can 
work backward using a goal seek.
In order to run a goal seek, you must have
»
» A formula
»
» A hard coded input cell that drives this formula
It doesn’t matter how complicated the model is. As long as there is a direct link 
between the formula and the input cell, the goal seek will calculate the result 
correctly.
The input cell must be hard coded. It won’t work if the input cell contains a 
formula.
Limiting project costs with a goal seek
What a goal seek is and how it works is best demonstrated using a simple model. 
For a practical example of how to use a goal seek to limit project costings, follow 
this series of steps as shown.
Again, let’s take the Project Costings Analysis from earlier in the chapter (refer to 
Figure 6-6). As shown in Figure 6-20, I’ve used simple formulas to calculate the 
total cost of a project based on the number of days worked, giving a total costing 
of $146,769. Unfortunately, however, I’ve only budgeted for $130,000  in staff 
costs. If I want the project to come in under budget, I need to know how much  
I need to cut the days worked by. I can manually tweak the number of days that 
has been input in cell D3, but it would take a long time to get the number exactly 
right. By using a goal seek, I can do it in seconds:
1.	 On the Data tab of the Ribbon, in the Forecast section, select What-If 
Analysis and then select Goal Seek.
The Goal Seek dialog box (shown in Figure 6-20) appears.
2.	 In the Set Cell field, make sure the cell contains the outcome you want, 
the total cost in cell D10.
3.	 In the To Value field, enter the number you want D10 to be, $130,000.
4.	 In the By Changing Cell field, enter the cell you want to change, the 
project days in cell $D$3.

118      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
5.	 Press OK.
The number of project days in cell D3 automatically changes to 53.1446540880503, 
which is a lot more information than you probably need! Round it down manually, 
by typing 53 into cell D3, which will change the total costings so that they come just 
under the $130,000 target you needed.
If you tried to manually enter a number with decimal places into cell D3, the data 
validation you created earlier in this chapter in Figure 6-6 would not allow it. 
Because a goal seek is essentially pasting the number into the cell, it circumvents 
the data validation rule, as though you had copied and pasted the value.
Calculating a break-even point  
with a goal seek
Using goal seek is also very helpful for break-even analysis. In this section, you 
perform a simple break-even calculation using a goal seek. (For more detail on 
break-even analysis, see Chapter 9.)
For a practical example of how to use a goal seek to calculate a break-even point, 
let’s work with the model you built earlier in this chapter. You’ve linked it through 
in such a way that if the number of units sold changes, the revenue changes, and 
so does the variable costs. You’d like to know the minimum number of units you 
need to sell in order to cover costs (the break-even point). Follow these steps:
1.	 Go to www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd and download 
and open File 0603.xlsx.
FIGURE 6-20: 
Using a goal seek 
to limit project 
costings.

CHAPTER 6  Excel Tools and Techniques for Financial Modeling      119
2.	 Go to the Assumptions worksheet, and try changing the number of units 
sold from 8,940 to 8,000.
3.	 Go back to the IS worksheet, and you’ll see that the profitability has 
dropped from 20% to 14%.
You could continue to do this manually until you reach zero, but a goal seek 
will be much quicker and more accurate.
4.	 On the Data tab on the Ribbon, in the Forecast section, select What-If 
Analysis and then select Goal Seek.
The Goal Seek dialog box appears (see Figure 6-21).
5.	 In the Set Cell field, enter the cell that contains the outcome you want 
(the profit), C24.
6.	 In the To Value field, enter the number you want C24 to be, 0.
7.	 In the By Changing Cell field, enter the cell you want to change (the 
number of units on the Assumptions page), $A$3.
8.	 Press OK.
The number of units in cell A3 on the Assumptions page automatically changes 
to 6,424, which is the break-even point.

Using Functions in Excel
T
he power of Microsoft Excel lies in its ability to do math for you. (Shh! Don’t 
tell your high school algebra teacher!) Of course, in order for Excel to work 
its magic, you need to be able to tell it what you need. And you do that by 
using formulas and functions. So, actually, you’re not totally off the hook when it 
comes to knowing math — you have to understand math in order to know which 
formula or function to use.
In this chapter, I start by telling you the difference between a formula and a func-
tion. Then I explain how to find the function you need, when you’re not quite sure 
what it’s called. Finally, as a financial modeler, you’ll be expected to have a firm 
grasp on the most commonly used functions in Excel, at the very least; this chap-
ter covers the functions that are absolutely critical for you to know.
Identifying the Difference between  
a Formula and a Function
In Excel, functions and formulas both help you calculate an answer. You may hear 
the two words used interchangeably, but they’re not technically the same. So, 
what’s the difference? A formula is an expression that uses cell references or 
Chapter 7

122      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
hard-coded numbers to calculate the value of a cell. For example, =A1+A2 and 
=923*12 are formulas. Sometimes a simple formula is all you need to get the right 
answer, but you can do so much more using functions. A function is a predefined 
formula already available in Excel. Functions streamline the process of creating a 
calculation. To date, Excel has more than 400 functions. Every time Microsoft 
releases a new version of Excel, more functions are added.
Functions can do complicated calculations that would be time-consuming to build 
manually. For example, if you wanted to add up a range of cells without using a 
function, you’d need to write something like =A1+A2+A3+A4+A5 instead of 
=SUM(A1:A5). Now, for five cells, writing it manually isn’t such a big deal. But 
what if you’re adding a range of hundreds of cells? Or thousands? Functions make 
calculations a lot easier.
There’s a lot more to being a good financial modeler than simply knowing lots and 
lots of Excel functions. But the more functions you know, the more likely you are 
to choose the one that’s most appropriate for the job at hand. As with many things 
in life, there are usually several ways to achieve the same result, but the best 
option is the one that’s the clearest and easiest for others to understand, as well 
as the simplest to audit (see Chapter 5 for more on formula auditing).
Finding the Function You Need
If you’re trying to perform a calculation in Excel and you aren’t sure what the 
function you want is called, don’t worry! Just follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Formulas tab.
2.	 Click the Insert Function button.
The Insert Function dialog box, shown in Figure 7-1, appears.
You can also access the Insert Function dialog box by clicking the fx button to 
the left of the Formula Bar or by using the shortcut Shift+F3.
3.	 In the Search for a Function text box, type a brief description of what you 
want to do, and then click Go.
A list of functions appears in the Select a Function box.
4.	 If you’re still not finding the function you’re looking for, select a category 
of functions from the Select a Category drop-down list to narrow the list.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      123
5.	 When you’ve found the function you think might be right, select it from 
the Select a Function box and click OK.
The Insert Function dialog box appears. Click the Help on This Function link to 
get even more help on the function you’ve selected.
Getting Familiar with the Most  
Important Functions
You’ve arrived at the meaty part of the chapter. This is where things get interest-
ing! In this section, I fill you in on all the functions you’ll rely on most often and 
give you some examples of how and why to use them.
SUM
As its name implies, the SUM function is used to add a series of numbers. ­Normally, 
SUM is used to add a contiguous range of cells, as shown in Figure 7-2, but it can 
also be used to add cells in a noncontiguous range (in other words, cells that 
aren’t adjacent to each other).
Figure 7-2 shows an example of adding a column of numbers. To try this out for 
yourself, select a cell either at the bottom or the far right of a range of cells, and 
click the Σ AutoSum button on the Home tab or Formulas tab.
FIGURE 7-1: 
The Insert 
Function  
dialog box.

124      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
When you click the Σ AutoSum button, the SUM function tries to automatically 
determine the figures that you want to add up — and it usually gets it right. If it 
hasn’t selected quite the right range you need to sum, you can fix it by doing any 
of the following:
»
» Manually edit the range by retyping the references in the Formula Bar.
»
» Select the correct range of cells with the mouse.
»
» Drag the plus sign (+) in the corner of the summed range cell to add to the 
range of cells selected. To do this in the example in Figure 7-2, you would 
hover the mouse above the upper-right corner of cell B2.
Figure 7-3 shows an example of summing up a specific set of cells in a noncon-
tiguous range. Because rows 8 and 15 already contain subtotals, you can’t simply 
add up the entire column for the full year total — it would include the subtotals as 
well at the values, so you’d end up with double the number. In the Formula Bar, 
enter the cell address of each cell that you want added together, so the formula in 
cell B16 is =SUM(B8,B15). Note that you need to enter a comma to separate each 
cell (or range of cells) from the others.
Instead of pressing Σ AutoSum, you can use the shortcut Alt+=. Try selecting a cell 
either at the bottom or the far right of a range of cells, and press Alt+=. The SUM 
function is inserted, exactly as though you had pressed the Σ AutoSum button. 
Learning and using shortcuts like this one can save a lot of time when you’re 
building financial models. See Chapter 6 for more on using shortcuts.
FIGURE 7-2: 
Using the SUM 
function to add 
up a column.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      125
MAX and MIN
The MAX function helps identify the maximum value. The syntax for this function 
is the same as for the SUM function — you can enter a range of cells, individual 
cells separated by commas, or a combination of both. The MAX function returns 
an error if the cells you need to analyze have some text that can’t be converted to 
numerical values.
For example, if you wanted to determine the maximum sales dollars for a year, 
you could use the MAX function to do so. In the example shown in Figure 7-4, the 
MAX function has been used to calculate the highest inventory level for the entire 
year with the function =MAX(B2:B13). Select cell B14 and you can complete this 
function in several different ways:
»
» Type =MAX( and select the range with the mouse or the arrow keys.
»
» Access the Insert Function dialog box (see “Finding the Function You Need,” 
earlier in this chapter), and search for MAX.
»
» Find the Σ AutoSum button on the Home tab or the Formulas tab (refer to 
Figure 7-2) and instead of clicking it, select Max from the drop-down box next 
to the button.
FIGURE 7-3: 
Using the SUM 
function to add 
noncontiguous 
cells.

126      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
The MIN function is the opposite of the MAX function: It calculates the lowest 
value in the column. The MIN function can also use any combination of ranged 
series and individual cells. The restrictions on what you enter and the results you 
get are similar to the MAX function. For example, if you wanted to determine the 
minimum inventory level for a year, you could use the MIN function, as shown in 
Figure 7-5 with the function =MIN(B2:B13).
FIGURE 7-4: 
Using the MAX 
function to 
calculate the 
maximum value.
FIGURE 7-5: 
Using the MIN 
function to

minimum value.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      127
Now that you’ve determined both the minimum and maximum values, you can 
use these formulas to calculate the spread, or variance, of the inventory levels 
between minimum and maximum values. Maybe your investors want to know 
how volatile your stock levels are. This calculation will give you some idea of the 
volatility of inventory.
For a practical example of how to use the MAX and MIN functions together, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Download File 0701.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd, open it, and select the tab labeled 7-6, or open a new Excel file 
and enter and format the data as shown in Figure 7-6.
2.	 In cell B16, enter the function =MAX(B2:B13) to calculate the maximum 
inventory level for the first year.
3.	 Copy that function across the row — in cells C16 and D16 — so that it 
calculates for all three years.
Because you want the cell referencing to change as you copy it across, no 
anchoring or dollar signs are required on the cell references.
4.	 In cell B17, enter the function =MIN(B2:B13) to calculate the minimum 
inventory level for the first year.
5.	 Copy that function across the row — in cells C17 and D17 — so that it 
calculates for all three years.
FIGURE 7-6: 
Three years of 
inventory levels.

128      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
6.	 In cell B18, enter the formula =B16-B17 to calculate the spread by 
deducting the minimum value from the maximum value.
7.	 Enter the titles “Maximum,” “Minimum,” and “Spread” in cells A16:A18, as 
shown in Figure 7-7.
8.	 Copy that formula across the row — in cells C18 and D18 — so that it 
calculates for all three years.
The completed model is shown in Figure 7-7. Note that the second year has the 
widest range, with a spread of 5,836.
This calculation could also have been done in a single row, using the formula 
=MAX(B2:B13)-MIN(B2:B13), but using this approach to building simple formulas 
first in separate cells makes your model easy to follow and it’s sometimes neces-
sary before attempting to build complex formulas. You can always put them 
together later, after you figure out what intermediary calculations you need.
AVERAGE
What if you have several hundred cells in a single spreadsheet column, each with 
a numerical value, and you want to find the average, or mean, value? Using ordi-
nary formulas, you would have to sum all the numbers up, count the number of 
rows, and then divide the sum by the number of rows. Fortunately, Excel has an 
AVERAGE function, which makes this calculation a lot easier.
FIGURE 7-7: 
Inventory Spread 
over three years.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      129
In the example shown in Figure 7-8, I quickly and easily calculated the average 
value of 7,019 with the AVERAGE function.
The AVERAGE function only uses the cells with values. Make sure that this is what 
you intend with your calculation. In most situations, there isn’t a lot of difference 
between a blank cell and a cell containing a zero value — and most functions treat 
a blank cell as though it contains a zero. When using the AVERAGE function, how-
ever, this is not the case. The AVERAGE function counts the cells with value zero, 
but it ignores empty cells and doesn’t include them in the calculation. If you want 
those cells to be counted, you need to enter a value of zero in the cells.
In the example shown in Figure 7-9, I don’t have any data yet for December, so 
cell B13 has been deliberately left blank. Although cell B13 has been included in the 
AVERAGE function’s range, the function ignores it, and calculates the correct 
average for January to November as 6,780.
In the example shown in Figure 7-10, the user has entered a zero value in cell B13 
instead of leaving it blank. The AVERAGE function includes this zero value when 
calculating the average, giving the value of 6,215.
COUNT and COUNTA
The COUNT function, as the name suggests, counts. Although this sounds pretty 
straightforward, it’s actually not as simple as it seems and, for this reason, the 
COUNT function is not as commonly used as the very closely related COUNTA 
function.
FIGURE 7-8: 
Using the 
AVERAGE 
function to 
calculate the 
average value.

130      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
The COUNT function only counts the number of cells that contain numerical val-
ues in a range. It will completely ignore blank cells and any cells within the range 
that don’t contain numerical values, such as text. For this reason, the COUNT 
function is used only if you specifically want to count the numbers only.
In the example shown in Figure 7-11, I’m in the preliminary stages of planning 
for a wedding, and I need to calculate a couple different numbers from the data. 
I need to know the number of guests to be invited in order to figure out the maxi-
mum capacity for the venue. I also need to know the number of invitations to 
FIGURE 7-9: 
The AVERAGE 
function ignores 
blank cells.
FIGURE 7-10: 
The AVERAGE 
function includes 
zero values in its 
calculation.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      131
send, so I can order them from the printers. I’m not sure yet how many people are 
in the Fleming family, so I’ve inserted a question mark for now. The number of 
guests can be easily calculated using the SUM function; if I update the numbers in 
the future, the sum will automatically change without a problem. I can use the 
COUNT function to calculate the number of invitations, with the formula 
=COUNT(B3:B13), but it will entirely ignore the cell containing the question mark 
and lead me to only order 10 invitations instead of 11.
The COUNTA function would be a much better solution to the problem shown in 
Figure 7-11. In fact, COUNTA is often used instead of COUNT. This is because the 
COUNTA function will count all cells containing data, not just numerical values, 
including error values and empty text (“”), but it will still ignore cells that are 
completely empty.
In the wedding-planning example, I could use the formula =COUNTA(B3:B13) 
instead, and this will give the correct result. Remember: The COUNTA function 
ignores blank cells, so if you were to remove the question mark from cell B7 and 
leave it blank, the answer would be incorrect again. A better solution would be to 
count the number of names in column A, using the formula =COUNTA(A3:A13), as 
shown in Figure 7-12.
Calculating a full-year projection  
using COUNT functions
Let’s try calculating a full-year projection using the COUNT and COUNTA func-
tions. For example, say you have only ten months of data, and you want to do a 
full-year projection for your monthly budget meeting. As shown in Figure 7-13, 
FIGURE 7-11: 
The COUNT 
function ignores 
cells without 
numerical values.

132      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
you can calculate how many months’ worth of data you have by using the formula 
=COUNT(B2:B13), which will give you the correct number of elapsed months (10).
To insert the function, you can either type out the formula in cell B15 (as shown in 
Figure 7-13), or select Count Numbers from the drop-down list next to the Σ 
­AutoSum button on the Home tab or the Formulas tab.
Note that the COUNTA function would work just as well in this case, but you

­function this time.

Try adding a number in for November, and notice that the elapsed months changes 
to 11. This is exactly what you want to happen because it will automatically update 
whenever you add new data.
In cell B16, calculate the average monthly amount of inventory for the months that 
have already elapsed. You can do this using the formula =B14/B15. Then you can 
convert this number to an annual amount by multiplying it by 12. So, the entire 
formula is =B14/B15*12, which yields the result of 81,520, as shown in Figure 7-14.
You can achieve exactly the same result using the formula =AVERAGE(B2:B13)*12. 
Which function you choose to use in your model is up to you, but the AVERAGE 
function does not require you to calculate the elapsed number of months as shown 
in row 15 in Figure 7-14. My personal preference is to see the number of months 
shown on the page so I can make sure the formula is working correctly.
Calculating headcount costs with  
the COUNT function
Let’s take a look at another example where the COUNT function can be useful. I 
often use the COUNT function to calculate headcount in a budget as it’s entered. 
For a practical example of how to use the COUNT function as part of a financial 
model, follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0701.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd, open it, and select the tab labeled 7-15 or enter and format 
the data as shown in Figure 7-15.
FIGURE 7-14:

12-month 
forecast.

134      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
2.	 In cell B17, enter the formula =COUNT(B3:B14) to count the number of 
staff in the budget.
You get the result of 9.
Again, the COUNTA function would’ve worked in this situation, but I specifically 
wanted to add up only the number of staff for which I have a budget.
Try entering TBD in one of the blank cells in the range. What happens? The COUNT 
function doesn’t change its value because it only counts cells with numerical  
values. Try using the COUNTA function instead (with TBD still in place in one of 
the formerly blank cells). The result changes from 9 to 10, which may or may not 
be what you want to happen.
After you’ve calculated the headcount, you can incorporate this information into 
your technology budget. Each of the costs in the budget is a variable cost driven by 
headcount. Follow these steps:
1.	 In cell F3, enter the formula =E3*B17.
This formula automatically calculates the total cost of all laptops based on the 
headcount numbers.
Because you want to copy this formula down, you need to anchor the cell 
reference to the headcount.
2.	 Change the formula to =E3*$B$17 by using the F4 shortcut key or typing 
in the dollar signs manually.
3.	 Copy the formula down the range, and add a total at the bottom, as 
shown in Figure 7-16.
FIGURE 7-15:

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      135
ROUND, ROUNDUP, and ROUNDDOWN
Several Excel functions round off numbers. The ones that are the most useful for 
financial modelers are ROUND, ROUNDUP, and ROWNDOWN. The ROUND func-
tion rounds to the nearest specified value  — whether it’s up or down. The 
ROUNDUP function rounds up to the nearest specified value. And — you guessed 
it — the ROUNDDOWN function rounds down to the nearest specified value.
To understand how this particular function works, try it out for yourself by fol-
lowing these steps:
1.	 Open a new file in Excel.
2.	 In cell A1, enter the number 45215754.575.
3.	 On the Home tab, in the Numbers section, click the comma button once 
to format the cell.
The formatting changes so the number now looks like this: 45,215,754.58. Note 
that the number remains the same; the third decimal place is still there but it’s 
just not showing due to the way the cell is formatted.
4.	 Select the blank cell A2, enter the formula =ROUND(A1,1).
The 1 in the last part of the formula means that you only want one decimal 
place. The decimal places are reduced to only one so that cell A2 contains the 
value 45,215,754.60. Note that the number really does only contain one decimal 
place; the extra decimal places are not being suppressed by formatting as they 
are in cell A1.
FIGURE 7-16: 
The completed 
budget.

136      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
5.	 Now select the blank cell A3, and enter the formula =ROUND(A1,0) to 
remove all decimal places completely.
The result is 45,215,755.00. Now the cell value contains no decimal places at all.
6.	 In the blank cell A4, enter the formula =ROUND(A1,-1) to round the 
number to the nearest ten.
The result is 45,215,750.00
7.	 In cell A5, enter the formula =ROUND(A1,-3) to round the number to the 
nearest thousand.
The result is 45,216,000.00.
8.	 In cell A6, enter the formula =ROUND(A1,-6) to round to the nearest 
million.
The result is 45,000,000.00, as shown in Figure 7-17.
For a practical example of how the ROUNDUP and ROUNDDOWN functions are 
used in a financial model, see the Corkscrew Cash Flow case study in Chapter 11.
Now let’s look at an example of how to use the ROUNDUP function as part of a 
financial model. Let’s say you’re building a five-year plan for a call center. Each 
call operator can handle 40 customers. In the first year, you have 500 customers, 
FIGURE 7-17: 
Using the ROUND 
function.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      137
and you expect that to increase by 20 percent per year. You have fixed costs of 
$250,000. The variable overheads are $100 per customer. Each call operator costs 
$65,000 per year. And all costs increase by inflation of 3 percent. How many call 
operators will you need each year? (Hint: Don’t forget to round up!)
This exercise demonstrates the difference between fixed, variable, and stepped 
costs, which are important concepts in management accounting and budget mod-
eling. As shown in Figure 7-18, fixed costs do not change as the number of units 
produced increases. Variable costs change directly in line with the number of units 
produced, and are also very simple to model. Stepped costs, however, do not 
increase in a linear fashion; instead, they increase in increments or “steps,” and 
these can be modeled using the ROUNDUP function.
This exercise also demonstrates a common escalation technique for increasing 
amounts by a growth rate, or inflation amount. You’ll often need to be able to 
include escalation in your models for the purpose of forecasting, as you do in this 
exercise. In this exercise, you need to increase your number of customers by 20 
percent each year. The number of customers in the first year is 500. When you add 
the 20 percent growth to this number, it becomes 600. Then you calculate the cus-
tomer number in the third year based on this number (600) not the first year (500). 
This effect, whereby the growth increases exponentially, is called compounding.
To calculate growth, use the following formula:
Base Amount × (1 + Growth)
You’re adding 1 (effectively 100 percent) to the growth rate (which is 20 percent) 
because you want the capital sum returned along with the accrued interest. 
FIGURE 7-18: 
Fixed, variable, 
and stepped 
costs.

138      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
­Multiplying an amount by (1 + Growth) is a very common calculation in financial 
modeling.
Okay, finally, to answer the question posed earlier — “How many call operators 
will you need each year?” — follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0701.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd, open it, and select the tab labeled 7-19 or enter and format 
the data as shown in Figure 7-19.
2.	 In cell C12, enter the formula =B12*(1+$B$4) to calculate the number of 
customers expected in Year 2.
Don’t forget to use the F4 shortcut to anchor the cell reference.
3.	 Copy this formula all the way across the row.
The calculated result in Year 5 is 1,037.
4.	 In cell B13, you need to work out how many call operators you need each 
year, so divide the number of customers by the customers per operator 
with the formula =B12/$B$3.
Don’t forget to use the F4 shortcut to anchor the cell reference.
The calculated result is 12.50.
FIGURE 7-19: 
Calculating

operators

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      139
Huh? That doesn’t make sense. You can’t employ a fraction of a person! You 
need to round up to the nearest whole person with the formula by wrapping a 
ROUNDUP function around the existing formula.
5.	 In cell B13, change the formula to =ROUNDUP(B12/$B$3,0).
6.	 Copy that formula all the way across the row.
The calculated result in Year 5 is 26. Compare your results to Figure 7-20.
You’ve now calculated the number of staff required. You can use this information 
later on in row 20 to work out their costs. For now, let’s continue working down 
the page.
In row 14, you need to calculate the overhead amounts for each year. There are two 
parts to this calculation: First, you need to apply inflation, and second, you need 
to multiply it by the number of customers. You could do the entire calculation in a 
single row, but the formula would be difficult to follow.
When it comes to formula layout in a financial model, simple is best! It’s far better 
to lay out the calculation step by step instead of trying to do the whole thing in  
one row.
FIGURE 7-20: 
Calculating 
number of call 
operators

ROUNDUP.

140      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Follow these steps to work out how much the staff will cost each year:
1.	 In cell B14, enter =B7 to link this to the overhead assumption.
2.	 In cell C14, enter the formula =B14*(1+$B$5) to add inflation.
This technique is exactly the same as the one you used when increasing the 
number of customers, but you’re picking up the inflation assumption instead 
of the growth assumption.
Don’t forget to use the F4 shortcut to anchor the cell reference.
3.	 Copy the formula all the way across the row.
The calculated result in Year 5 is 113.
Note that you have different formulas in cells B14 and C14. Ordinarily, you should 
try to have consistent formulas wherever possible, to reduce the number of for-
mulas in the model, but in this case, it’s just not practical.
In row 15, you need to calculate the staff costs per operator for each year. This 
works in exactly the same way as the overhead costs. You’ll increase the per-
operator costs by inflation each year and multiply it by the number of operators 
later on. Follow these steps:
1.	 In cell B15, enter =B8 to link this cell to the cost per operator.
2.	 In cell C15, enter =B15*(1+$B$5) to add inflation to this number.
Don’t forget to use the F4 shortcut to anchor the cell reference.
3.	 Copy the formula all the way across the row.
The calculated result in Year 5 is $73,158.
You’ve finished the workings block, so you can start to calculate the costs 
below in row 18.
4.	 In cell B18, enter =B6 to link this cell to the fixed cost assumption with 
the formula.
5.	 In cell C18, enter the formula =B18*(1+$B$5) to add inflation to this 
number.
6.	 Copy the formula all the way across the row.
The calculated result in Year 5 is $281,377.
7.	 In cell B19, enter the formula =B14*B12 to calculate the total overhead 
costs by multiplying the overhead cost per customer per year by the 
number of customers in that year.
No need to lock the cell referencing, because you want this to copy across the row.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      141
8.	Copy the formula all the way across the row.
The calculated result in Year 5 is $116,693.
9.	In cell B20, enter the formula =B15*B13 to calculate the total call staff 
costs by multiplying the cost per operator by the number of operators.
10.	Copy the formula all the way across the row.
The calculated result in Year 5 is $1,902,110.
11.	In cell B21, enter the formula =SUM(B18:B20) to sum the total costs.
Another option is to select cell B21 and use the shortcut Alt+=.
12.	Copy the formula all the way across the row.
The calculated result in Year 5 is $2,300,180. Compare your results to Figure 7-21.
IF
The IF function is very commonly used in financial models because it allows you 
to test certain conditions in your model and change outcomes or results depend-
ing on what the user inserts into the model. It’s especially useful when building 
scenarios, because you can build the model so that the user can turn certain con-
ditions on and off.
FIGURE 7-21: 
The completed 
five-year strategic 
forecast.

142      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Type =IF and then use the Ctrl+A shortcut. The IF Function Arguments dialog box 
appears. There are three fields you need to fill in:
»
» The logical statement that is evaluated: For example, is the weather sunny 
today? The answer to this will either be true or false.
»
» The result if the statement is true: In this case, it might be “Go to the 
beach.”
»
» The result if the statement is false: In this case, it might be “Stay home.”
The syntax looks like this:
=IF(statement being tested, value if true, value if false),
So, for this example, in plain language, the syntax looks like this:
=IF(the weather is sunny,go to the beach,stay home),
Written in an Excel formula, if the weather has been put into cell A1, the formula 
would look like this (see Figure 7-22):
=IF(A1=“Sunny”,”go to the beach”,”stay home”)
When using text within a formula, as you’re doing in this example, you must put 
quotation marks (““) around any text. However, if you use the IF Function Argu-
ments dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-22, there is no need to put the quotation 
marks in manually — the dialog box will do it for you.
FIGURE 7-22: 
Inserting an IF 
function using 
the Function 
Arguments  
dialog box.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      143
The IF function can be used to automatically calculate whether a set of numbers 
meets certain conditions. For example, you can create a variance alert when com-
paring actual costs to budget — if the variance is greater than 10 percent, you 
want the formula to automatically alert us. For a practical example of how to use 
the IF function as part of a financial model, follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0701.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd and select the tab labeled 7-23-blank or enter and format the 
data in columns A through D, as shown in Figure 7-23.
2.	 In cell E3, enter the formula =D3-C3 to calculate the variance.
When preparing an actual versus budget report, you should always show the 
variance as a positive if it’s “better” than budget or a negative if it’s “worse” than 
budget. This report shows expenses, so an actual amount higher than budget 
is a bad thing and should be shown as a negative value. For an expense report, 
the variance calculation is budget minus actual; for a revenue report, the 
variance calculation is actual minus budget.
If you’re showing an income or profit and loss statement with revenue at the 
top part of the report and expenses at the bottom, the formula can’t be exactly 
the same all the way down the page. Although the consistency of formulas is 
an important part of financial modeling best practice, it’s not always practical!
3.	 Copy this formula down the column.
When copying down a column, you can select the cell you want to copy, hover 
the mouse over the lower-left corner until the cross-hairs appear, and double-
click. The formula is copied all the way down to the bottom.
4.	 Select cell E13 and use the shortcut Alt+=, and then press enter to sum 
the column.
The calculated value is $1,555.
5.	 In cell F3, enter the formula =E3/D3 to calculate the variance percentage.
6.	 Copy this formula down the column.
You will notice an error value in row 11. This is because there was no budget for 
Other IT Costs and the formula can’t divide by zero, so it shows an error value.
7.	 Select cell F3 and suppress this error by editing the formula to 
=IFERROR(E3/D3,0).
Any formula errors will show a zero value instead of the error.
8.	 Copy this formula down the column.
Go back to the first cell (E13) to make the change and then copy it down, instead 
of making the change only where the error shows (E11). This way, if the numbers 
change in the future, the errors will always be suppressed.

144      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
9.	Ensure that the variance formula also copies all the way down to cell F13 
and edit the formatting if necessary.
Now that you’ve set up the actual versus budget report, you can add an IF 
function to alert you when the variance is too high. First, you need to deter-
mine what you mean by “too high.”
10.	In cell G1, enter the value –10%.
You’ll link to this cell because this is the maximum variance to budget you can 
tolerate.
Don’t forget to press F4 after referring to G1 to lock the cell reference so that 
you can copy it down.
11.	In cell G3, type =IF( and press Ctrl+A.
The Function Arguments dialog box appears.
12.	Enter the formula =IF(F3<$G$1,”Over budget”,0), as shown in Figure 7-23.
13.	Ensure that the variance formula also copies all the way down to cell G13 
and edit the formatting if necessary.
Your actual versus budget variance report is complete!
The zero values in the G column appear as a dash because of the way the cells have 
been formatted. This was done using the Comma Style in the Numbers section on 
the Home tab in the Ribbon. It looks much neater than showing a zero.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      145
COUNTIF and SUMIF
COUNTIF and SUMIF are very handy functions to know for modeling. They add or 
count ranges of data, and are among some of my favorite, most frequently used 
functions.
Tallying sales with COUNTIF
COUNTIF is used to count the number of cells that match specified criteria. For 
example, you have a list of sales made by salesperson by region, as shown in 
­Figure  7-24. You’d like to know how many sales were made in each region.  
To solve this problem, follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0701.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd, open it, and select the tab labeled 7-24.
2.	 Copy column B in its entirety to column E, as shown in Figure 7-24.
3.	 Leave column E selected, and on the Data tab, in the Data Tools section, 
click the Remove Duplicates button.
4.	 Click OK.
A message box displays how many duplicate values are to be removed.
5.	 Click OK.
The duplicate values are removed, leaving you with a unique list of regions, as 
shown in Figure 7-25.
FIGURE 7-24: 
The Remove 
Duplicates  
dialog box.

146      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
6.	In cell F1, type No. Sales and format if necessary.
7.	In cell F2, type =COUNTIF( and press Ctrl+A.
The Function Arguments dialog box appears. The Range field shows the range 
containing the original data.
8.	Put your cursor in the Range field and then highlight the cells B2:B22; 
press the F4 shortcut key to lock the cell references.
9.	Tab to the Criteria field, and select the first cell in the table you’re 
building (cell E2 as shown in Figure 7-25).
Note that you don’t need to lock this reference because you want the cell 
reference to change as you copy it down the column.
10.	Click OK.
The resulting formula will be =COUNTIF($B$2:$B$22,E2) with the calculated 
value of 5.
11.	Copy the formula down the column.
12.	Click cell F6, use the shortcut Alt+=, and press Enter to add the sum total.
The calculated value is 21.
13.	Format as necessary.
14.	In cell F7, enter the formula =COUNTA(B2:B22)-F6 to make sure the totals 
are the same.
FIGURE 7-25:

15.	Format the zero to a dash by clicking the comma button from the 
Number section of the Home tab.
16.	Check your numbers against Figure 7-26.
Reporting sales with SUMIF
SUMIF is similar to COUNTIF, but it sums rather than counts the values of cells in 
a range that meet given criteria. Following on from the last example, let’s say you 
want to know how much (in terms of dollar value) in sales were made in each 
region. To solve this problem, follow these steps:
1.	 In cell F1, type “No. Sales” and format if necessary.
2.	 In cell F2, type =SUMIF( and press Ctrl+A.
The Function Arguments dialog box appears.
3.	 In the Range field, enter the items you’re adding together (B2:B22), and 
then press F4.
4.	 In the Criteria field, enter the criteria you’re looking for in that range (E2).
You don’t press the F4 key here, because you want to copy it down the column.
5.	 In the Sum_range field, enter the numbers you want to sum together 
(C2:C22), and then press F4.
Figure 7-27 shows what this should look like.
FIGURE 7-26:

6.	Click OK.
The resulting formula will be =SUMIF($B$2:$B$22,E2,$C$2:$C$22) with the 
calculated value of $99,310.
7.	Copy the formula down the column.
8.	Click cell G6, use the shortcut Alt+=, and press Enter to add the sum 
total.
The calculated value is $384,805.
9.	Format as necessary.
10.	In cell G7, enter the formula =SUM(C2:C22)-G6 to make sure the totals are 
the same.
11.	Format the zero to a dash by clicking the comma button in the Number 
section of the Home tab.
12.	Check your numbers against Figure 7-28.
You’ve now got a summary report at the bottom, showing you how much you’ve 
sold in terms of number and dollar value.
VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP
The lookup functions — VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP — are very often used in build-
ing financial models and are often the “go to” function for many modelers and 
analysts.
FIGURE 7-27: 
The SUMIF 
Function 
Arguments  
dialog box.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      149
Despite its popularity, the humble VLOOKUP is often misused and overused because 
many users  — especially when they’re just starting out  — don’t understand 
exactly how it works. VLOOKUP stands for vertical lookup. It can be used any time 
you have a list of data with a unique lookup field in the leftmost column. The 
VLOOKUP function searches through a data set and returns a corresponding match 
from a specified row and column.
HLOOKUP works in exactly the same way, except that the data is horizontally  
orientated instead of vertically oriented.
Mapping Data with VLOOKUP
Using the previous example from the last section, you have a list of sales and 
regions. Let’s say you want to abbreviate the region names from “North West” to 
“N/W,” because that’s what your team is used to seeing.
If you followed along with the last example, simply insert an extra column before 
column D to enter the abbreviation as shown in Figure 7-28. Right-click column 
D, and select Insert. Or you can download File 0701.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/
financialmodelinginexcelfd. Open it and select the tab labeled 7-29.
To solve this problem, follow these steps:
1.	 In cell G2, start to enter the abbreviations for each region.
This is the mapping table you’re using to map the regions to their abbreviated 
names. If you’re using Excel 2013 or later, Flash Fill will begin to automatically 
populate the data for you as shown in Figure 7-29. Very cool.
FIGURE 7-28: 
The completed 
sales total table.

150      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
2.	 Select cell C2 and then click the Insert Function command on the 
Formulas tab (or just press Shift+F3).
3.	 In the Select a Function box, scroll down until you see the VLOOKUP 
function; select VLOOKUP and click OK.
4.	 The first parameter is the criteria you’re testing — in this case, the first 
region you need the abbreviation for, North East — so enter B2 in the 
Lookup_value field.
The next field is the table array, which contains the data you want to reference. 
This is where it gets tricky. The criteria you’re looking for must always be in the 
far-left column of the data table you’re referencing in the table array.
WHY ERROR CHECKS MATTER
If your Range and your Sum_range don’t match up, your result will be wrong. For 
­example =SUMIF($B$2:$B$22,E2,$C$1:$C$22) — where one range includes the heading 
but the other does not — will give you an incorrect result without warning! This is a very 
easy mistake to make, and quite common in financial modeling. You can see in the 
­following figure that the totals are not the same because the SUMIF function is picking 
up the incorrect range. Unfortunately, it does not return an error. Instead, it returns a 
number ($81,394) that looks as though it could be correct but is in fact entirely wrong! 
The same problem can occur for the COUNTIF function.
Building error checks into your model, as you’ve done in this example, can avoid error in 
formulas like this.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      151
5.	 In the Table_array field, enter F2:G5, because in this case, the data you’re 
referencing will be in that range.
Press the F4 shortcut key to lock the cell reference.
In the Col_index_num field, you need to enter which column the value is found 
in. You need to tell the function which column in the table array you want it to 
return. In this case, you want it to tell you the abbreviation for the region. So, 
counting from the far-left side of the table array (starting in column F), you 
want it to return to the second column.
6.	 Enter a number 2 in the Col_index_num field, as shown in Figure 7-30.
The optional fourth field, Range_lookup, is where you specify whether a close 
match is okay.
7.	 If you want an exact match, enter zero in the Range_lookup field; 
otherwise, leave it blank.
You may also enter TRUE or FALSE, but typing a zero or leaving it blank is 
quicker.
Make sure to enter a zero or FALSE in the last field. If you leave it blank, it will 
search for a “close” match and return an incorrect result. There are very few 
instances where you want a close match.
8.	 Click OK to complete the formula.
The completed formula will be =VLOOKUP(B2,$F$2:$G$5,2,0) with a returned 
result of “N/E.”

10.	Go to the mapping table and adjust the abbreviated names.
For example, change “N/E” to “NE,” and you’ll notice the abbreviations in 
column C also automatically change. In this way, you can save time in building 
your reports.
Breaking a VLOOKUP
If you’ve created a VLOOKUP in a model such as the one in the preceding section, 
this should work well . . . until someone enters or deletes a column in your source 
data! A formula such as the following specifically asks for the second column, so 
it won’t work if someone inserts a column range within the Regions range:
=VLOOKUP(B2,$F$2:$G$5,2,0)
It won’t work because your required column becomes the third column, but the 
VLOOKUP is still asking for the second.
VLOOKUPs are not very robust formulas — you can see how easy they are to break! 
Here’s what you can do to avoid this problem and make your VLOOKUP more 
robust:
»
» Protect the sheet to stop people from inserting or deleting rows or columns.
»
» Use a “helper” row where the column number needs to be manually updated, 
or automatically calculated with a COLUMN function.
»
» Insert an error to alert the user if this mistake has occurred.
»
» Replace the hard-coded number 2 with a dynamic function such as a COLUMN 
or MATCH function that will automatically update.
Using the HLOOKUP function
The HLOOKUP works in exactly the same way as the VLOOKUP, except that the 
data is arranged horizontally instead of vertically. The HLOOKUP function is sub-
ject to exactly the same issues as VLOOKUP and it works in exactly the same way, 
except for the orientation. If your source data in the range is orientated vertically, 
use VLOOKUP, and if it’s orientated horizontally, use HLOOKUP. See the nearby 
sidebar for a practical example of using an HLOOKUP nested formula in a financial 
modeling context.

154      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
WORKING WITH NESTED FUNCTIONS
As you may have discovered by now, Excel allows you to include more than one func-
tion in a formula. For example, you can multiply a sum total by another number with 
the following formula:
= SUM(B1:B20)*A3
But this does not make it a nested formula. A nested formula is a function that’s 
included inside another function. This technique allows you to build more complex for-
mulas. For example:
=IF(SUM(D3:D23)<0,1,0)
This is a basic IF statement, but a SUM function has been included in one of the  
fields.
The IF statement is probably most commonly used as a nested function. You can  
actually nest up to 64 functions within a formula model, but this is not recommended, 
and it’s certainly not good modeling practice!
With most functions covered in this chapter, I encourage you to make use of the 
Function Arguments dialog box. This dialog box doesn’t work easily with nested  
formulas, but there is a bit of a trick to it.
Try typing in the nested formula:
=(SUM(D1:D5)*AVERAGE(A1:A5))/12
Try to go into the Insert Function dialog box by pressing the fx button next to the 
Formula Bar. An unhelpful Function Arguments dialog box appears, as shown in the  
following figure.

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      155
Now, try clicking within the formula or within the SUM part of the formula and press fx. 
The dialog box for the SUM part of the nested formula appears, as shown in the  
following figure.

Being Aware of Advanced Functions  
and Functionality
In this chapter, I cover the functions that are most commonly used in financial 
modeling. If you master this handful of functions, you’ll be able to get started 
with building and using financial models. As your skills progress, however, you 
may find that you’re trying to do something that’s difficult to achieve with your 
existing repertoire of functions. If you find yourself building long and complicated 
formulas, or it feels like there must be an easier way to do what you’re trying to 
do, there probably is an easier way to do it. I recommend stopping what you’re 
doing and if you have access to a mentor or a more experienced modeler, explain 
what you’re trying to do and see if she can recommend a better way of approach-
ing the problem. If you don’t have access to someone you can ask, try to explain 
your problem in plain English to your favorite search engine and, chances are, 
you’ll find what you need. If you don’t have any success the first time, try explain-
ing the problem a different way.
Now, do the same thing by clicking within the formula next to or within the AVERAGE 
part of the formula and press fx. The dialog box for the AVERAGE part of the nested  
formula appears, as shown in the following figure.
This tip is helpful when troubleshooting or error-checking nested functions.
(continued)

CHAPTER 7  Using Functions in Excel      157
Say, for example, that you have a list of names, regions, products, and sales as 
shown in Figure  7-32. You’d like to summarize these numbers to show both 
regions and products on a dashboard. You think a SUMIF might do the trick, but 
you’re limited to only one input range.
So, you open your favorite search engine and search for SUMIF with two ranges. You 
see a reference to the SUMIFS function. On further research, you discover some 
online tutorials that you work through carefully, and you discover that this might 
actually do the trick, as shown in Figure 7-33.
So now, the SUMIFS function is added to your repertoire of functions you can use 
if and when the situation requires. This is an example of how you can “learn on 
the job.” By doing a little research, you can learn more advanced tools and 
functions.
If you’re interested in learning more advanced functions than what I have the space 
for in this book, I recommend looking into the following functions as a next step:
»
» COUNTIFS, which is very similar to SUMIFS
»
» Nesting an INDEX and two MATCH functions to create a more robust lookup 
than either a VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP
»
» Payment calculation functions, such as IPMT and PPMT (see Chapter 8 for 
more on PMT)

in certain situations

Applying Scenarios to 
Your Financial Model
O
ne of the things that makes a financial model a financial model and not a 
spreadsheet is that it contains hypothetical outcomes or scenarios. When 
your model has been built properly, using links with data only entered 
once (see Chapter 4), adding scenarios to your model is a fairly straightforward 
process, and including scenarios doesn’t require much work or redesign.
In this chapter, you take a couple of simple models that you’ve already built in 
previous chapters, and see how simple it is to add scenarios to improve the func-
tionality. With a well-built model that has all inputs properly linked through to 
outputs, changing inputs and watching the outputs change is fairly easy. In fact, 
you could argue that this is pretty much the whole purpose of building a financial 
model in the first place!
Scenarios and sensitivity analysis are a great way to reduce risk by seeing all the 
possible outcomes of the project or venture you’re modeling. What would be the 
absolute worst that could happen? If everything that can go wrong does go wrong, 
can you still afford to pay your staff? There are usually interdependent effects and 
interactions between multiple variables, which may change in the model. That’s 
Chapter 8

160      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
why it’s so important to have links automatically calculating within a model. For 
example, if units sold increases, then revenue increases, so profitability increases, 
so cash flow increases, so borrowing decreases, so interest payable decreases, 
and so on. . . .
Scenarios can also help you make decisions. After you’ve built scenarios into the 
model, the hypothetical outcomes can be laid out so that the decision makers can 
see the expected impact of each course of action. How closely these outcomes 
reflect reality depends, of course, on the accuracy of the model as well as the 
assumptions that have been used — but you already knew that!
Identifying the Differences between  
Types of Analysis
Scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, and what-if analysis are all very similar to 
each other. In fact, they’re really only slight variations of the same thing. Here’s 
a breakdown:
»
» What-if analysis: What-if analysis is the process of testing to see “what would 
happen if” you change something in the model.
»
» Sensitivity analysis: Sensitivity analysis is the process of tweaking one key 
input or driver in a financial model and seeing how sensitive the model is to 
the change in that variable.
For example, if you have an income statement with a profit of $1.2 million, 
you may want to know how that profit is affected by changes in price. If you 
reduce the per unit price of one of the products from $5.25 to $4.75, the profit 
may decrease to $975,000, so you can see that the business is quite sensitive 
to changes in the price for that product. This process of changing a single 
input in isolation is referred to as performing sensitivity analysis.
»
» Scenario analysis: Scenario analysis is the process of tweaking a whole series 
of inputs or drivers in a financial model and seeing what happens with the 
model.
For example, a worst-case scenario could include not only the price decreasing 
but interest rates increasing, number of customers decreasing, and unfavor-
able exchange rates. Sometimes these inputs affect each other — for exam-
ple, a reduction in sales affecting profitability may also cause sales commission 
or bonuses to go down, which would also affect profitability.

CHAPTER 8  Applying Scenarios to Your Financial Model      161
Building Drop-Down Scenarios
The most commonly used method of building scenarios (and the one that I most 
often teach in my training courses) is to use a combination of formulas and drop-
down boxes. In the model, you create a table of possible scenarios and their inputs 
and link the scenario names to an input cell drop-down box. The inputs of the 
model are linked to the scenario table. If the model has been built properly with all 
the inputs flowing through to the outputs, then the results of the model will 
change as the user selects different options from the drop-down box.
Data validation drop-down boxes are used for a number of different purposes in 
financial modeling, including scenario analysis. For an example of using data 
­validations to reduce errors in a financial model, turn to Chapter 12.
Using data validations to model  
profitability scenarios
In Chapter 7, you create a simple one-page model to calculate costs based on par-
ticular inputs. I recommend that you build the model as described in Chapter 7 
first so that you understand how this simple model works before adding the sce-
narios to it. Alternatively, you can find a copy of the completed model by down-
loading File 0801.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd. 
Open it and select the tab labeled 8-1-start.
The way I’ve modeled this, the inputs are lined up in column B. You could perform 
sensitivity analysis simply by changing one of the inputs — for example, change 
the customers per call operator in cell B3 from 40 to 45, and you’ll see all the 
dependent numbers change. This would be a sensitivity analysis, because you’re 
changing only one variable. Instead, you’re going to change multiple variables at 
once in this full scenario analysis exercise, so you’ll need to do more than tweak a 
few numbers manually.
To perform a scenario analysis using data validation drop-down boxes, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Take the existing model that you created in Chapter 7 (or downloaded), 
and cut and paste the descriptions from column C to column F.
You can do this by highlighting cells C6:C8, pressing Ctrl+X, selecting cell F6, and 
pressing Enter.
The inputs in cells B3 to B8 are the active range that drives the model and will 
remain so. However, they need to become formulas that change depending on 
the drop-down box that you’ll create.

162      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
2.	 Copy the range in column B across to columns C, D, and E.
You can do this by highlighting B3:B8, pressing Ctrl+C, selecting cells C3:E3, and 
pressing Enter. These amounts will be the same for each scenario until we 
change them.
3.	 In row 2 enter the titles Best Case, Base Case, and Worst Case, as shown in 
Figure 8-1.
Note that the formulas still link to the inputs in column B, as we can see by 
selecting cell C12 and pressing the F2 shortcut key as shown in figure 8-1.
4.	 Edit the inputs underneath each scenario.
You can put whatever you think is likely, but in order to match the numbers to 
those in this example, enter the values as shown in Figure 8-2. Ignore column B 
for now.
FIGURE 8-1: 
Setting up the 
model for 
scenario analysis.
FIGURE 8-2: 
Inputs for 
scenario analysis.

CHAPTER 8  Applying Scenarios to Your Financial Model      163
Now you need to add the drop-down box at the top, which is going to drive your 
scenarios. It doesn’t really matter where exactly you put the drop-down box, but 
it should be in a location that’s easy to find, usually at the top of the page.
5.	 In cell E1, enter the title Scenario:.
6.	 Select cell F1, and change the formatting to input so that the user can see 
that this cell is editable.
The easiest way to do this is to follow these steps:
•	 Click one of the cells that are already formatted as an input, such as cell E3.
•	 Press the Format Painter icon in the Clipboard section on the left-hand side 
of the Home tab. Your cursor will change to a paintbrush.
•	 Select cell F1 to paste the formatting.
Format Painter is normally for single use. After you’ve selected the cell, the 
paintbrush will disappear from the cursor. If you want the Format Painter to 
become “sticky” and apply to multiple cells, double-click the icon when you 
select it from the Home tab.
7.	 Now, in cell F1, select Data Validation from the Data Tools section of the 
Data tab.
The Data Validation dialog box appears.
8.	 On the Settings tab, change the Allow drop-down to List, use the mouse 
to select the range =$C$2:$E$2 (see Figure 8-3), and click OK.
9.	 Click the drop-down box, which now appears next to cell F1, and select 
one of the scenarios (for example, Base Case).
FIGURE 8-3: 
Creating the data 
validation 
drop-down 
scenarios.

164      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Applying formulas to scenarios
The cells in column B are still driving the model, and these need to be replaced by 
formulas. Before you add the formulas, however, you should change the format-
ting of the cells in the range to show that they contain formulas, instead of hard-
coded numbers. Follow these steps:
1.	 Select cells B3:B8, and select the Fill Color from the Font group on the 
Home tab.
2.	 Change the Fill Color to a white background.
It’s very important to distinguish between formulas and input cells in a model. 
You need to make it clear to any user opening the model that the cells in this 
range contain formulas and should not be overridden.
Now you need to replace the hard-coded values in column B with formulas that 
will change as the drop-down box changes. You can do this using a number of 
different functions; an HLOOKUP, a nested IF statement, an IFS, and a SUMIF will 
all do the trick. Add the formulas by following these steps:
1.	 Select cell B3, and add a formula that will change the value depending on 
what is in cell F1.
Here is what the formula will be under the different options:
•	 =HLOOKUP($F$1,$C$2:$E$8,2,0)
Note that with this solution, you need to change the row index number 
from 2 to 3 and so on as you copy the formula down. Instead, you could 
use a ROW function in the third field like this: =HLOOKUP($F$1,$C$2:$E$8,
ROW(A3)-1,0)
•	 =IF($F$1=$C$2,C3,IF($F$1=$D$2,D3,E3))
•	 =IFS($F$1=$C$2,C3,$F$1=$D$2,D3,$F$1=$E$2,E3)
•	 =SUMIF($C$2:$E$2,$F$1,C3:E3)
As always, there are several different options to choose from and the best 
solution is the one that is the simplest and easiest to understand. Any of these 
functions will produce exactly the same result, but in my opinion, having to 
change the row index number in the HLOOKUP is not robust, and adding the 
ROW may be confusing for a user. The nested IF statement is tricky to build 

CHAPTER 8  Applying Scenarios to Your Financial Model      165
and follow, and although the new IFS function is designed to make a nested IF 
function simpler, it’s still rather unwieldy. I find the SUMIF quite simple to build 
and follow, and it’s easy to expand if you need to add extra scenarios in the 
future.
Note that IFS is a new function that is only available with Office 365 and Excel 
2016 or later installed. If you use this function and someone opens this model 
in a previous version of Excel, she can view the formula, but she won’t be able 
to edit it.
2.	 Copy the formula in cell B3 down the column.
By using an ordinary copy and paste, you’ll lose all your formatting. It’s 
important to retain the formatting of the model so that you can see at a glance 
which inputs are in dollar values, percentages, or customer numbers. Use 
Paste Formulas to retain the formatting. You can access it by copying the cell 
onto the clipboard, highlighting the destination range, right-clicking, and 
selecting the Paste Formulas icon to paste formulas only, and leave the 
formatting intact (see Figure 8-4).
Now for the fun part! It’s time to test the scenario functionality in the  
model.
FIGURE 8-4: 
Using Paste 
Formulas to 
retain formatting.

166      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
3.	 Click cell F1, change the drop-down box, and watch the model outputs 
change as you toggle between the different scenarios, as shown in 
Figure 8-5.
FIGURE 8-5: 
The completed 
scenario analysis.
THE LIMITATIONS OF DROP-DOWN 
SCENARIOS
As you scroll through different scenarios, you can see that this tool is extremely power-
ful. By changing the drop-down box, you can see all the calculations. The key advantage 
to using this method is that it’s relatively simple to build and easy for the user to under-
stand and audit. Anyone using the model, even with a fairly limited knowledge of Excel, 
can easily trace back and see how the numbers have been calculated.
The biggest limitation of drop-down scenarios, however, is that you cannot see multiple 
scenarios side by side. The user needs to print or save a copy of each scenario in order 
to compare them to each other, which can become tedious.
Data tables do allow you to see the outputs of a model side by side. (See “Applying 
Sensitivity Analysis with Data Tables” for more information.)

CHAPTER 8  Applying Scenarios to Your Financial Model      167
Applying Sensitivity Analysis  
with Data Tables
Data tables are among the more advanced and complex financial modeling tools 
available. Data tables can be used for scenarios and sensitivity analysis, but they’re 
less commonly used because they’re more advanced. Data tables are unlike most 
other formulas in that you can’t trace dependents, and they’re very difficult to 
follow unless you’re familiar with them. If anyone you work with doesn’t know 
data tables, he won’t be able to edit the table or make any changes.
Setting up the calculation
Let’s go back to the profitability model you created in Chapter 6. I recommend 
that you work through the internal links exercise in Chapter 6, or download the 
completed version of this model, called File 0603.xlsx, from www.dummies.com/
go/financialmodelinginexcelfd first so that you understand how this simple 
model works before adding sensitivities to it.
Because the model links directly to assumptions, you can use data tables to test 
the sensitivity of the profit margin to changes in assumptions such as the number 
of units sold and the cost per unit.
The existing model has a simple Income Statement linking to a number of input 
variables. You can test the sensitivity of one of the outputs, such as the profit 
margin, to variations in the input variables. Let’s see how much the profit margin 
changes when the sales price and cost per unit inputs change. Of course, you could 
do this manually, but to see the various outputs in a single table, you need to use 
a data table.
Building a data table with one input
To create a data table in this model, follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0802.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd, open the file, and select the Assumptions tab.
You’re testing how sensitive the profit margin is to changes in the sales price. 
The inputs for the sales price to be used in the data table have been entered in 
column A already. The next thing you need to do is to link the output cell to the 
data table. This needs to go at the top of the data table.

168      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
2.	 Link cell B9 to the profit margin using the formula =‘Summary’!B9.
Don’t type this in — press = and then click the Summary tab, select cell B9, and 
press Enter.
3.	 Highlight the entire data table in cells A9:B15, including the output cell, 
as shown in Figure 8-6.
Note that you must highlight all these cells in order for it to work.
4.	 Select What-if Analysis from the Data tab and choose Data Table from the 
options (refer to Figure 8-6).
The Data Table dialog box appears.
Because you’re only doing a one-input data table, you only need to enter data 
for one variable, but which variable depends on how the data table is arranged 
and whether the input variable you’re testing is in a row or a column. Because 
it’s in a column, you should use the Column input cell field.
5.	 Link the column input cell field to the input field for the sales price (cell 
A4) as shown in Figure 8-7.
6.	 Click OK.
Your data table populates with the completed sensitivity table, as shown in 
Figure 8-8.
FIGURE 8-6: 
Selecting the Data 
Table tool on the 
Ribbon.

CHAPTER 8  Applying Scenarios to Your Financial Model      169
Note that the formulas in the data table will have curly brackets around them like 
this =TABLE{,A4}. This is because it’s an array formula. Array formulas work dif-
ferently from ordinary formulas because array formulas treat the data like an 
array instead of a single data value. For this reason, you can’t edit or delete a 
single cell within a data table in isolation. To make any changes, you need to use 
the Data Table tool or highlight all the formulas from cell A10 to B15, press Delete, 
and start again.

170      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Building a data table with two inputs
You can add another input to your data table by listing another input variable 
across the top. Let’s add the cost per unit as well as the sales price, and this time, 
we’ll test the total profit (the dollar value) instead of the profit margin (percent-
age). To complete this sensitivity analysis, follow these steps:
1.	 Scroll down the model to cell A18 and link it to the total profit using the 
formula =‘Summary’!B8.
2.	 Highlight the entire data table in cells A18:E24, including the output cell, 
as shown in Figure 8-9.
Note that again, you must highlight all these cells in order for it to work.
3.	 Select What-if Analysis from the Data tab and choose Data Table from the 
options.
The Data Table dialog box appears.
4.	 Link the row input cell field to the input field for the cost per unit (A5) 
and the column field to the input field for the sales price (A4), as shown in 
Figure 8-9.
5.	 Click OK.
Your data table populates with the completed sensitivity table, as shown in 
Figure 8-10.

CHAPTER 8  Applying Scenarios to Your Financial Model      171
Applying probability weightings  
to your data table
The great thing about adding a data table to your financial model is that it gives 
you a large number of variables. However, you know that only one of these can be 
correct! You can try to reduce the amount of uncertainty by adding probability 
weightings to a data table because you know that not all outcomes are equally 
likely.
If you believe certain outcomes to be equally likely, then use the same weighting, 
while still retaining the probability functionality in the model. For example, if you 
have four different possible inputs for a data table, simply weight each of them at 
25 percent, and the user can change the weighting inputs later.
Build on the data table that you already created in the previous section by follow-
ing this series of steps:
1.	 Download File 0803.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd, open the file, and select the Assumptions tab.
2.	 Enter the probability of each outcome in row 18 and column A, as shown 
in Figure 8-11.
You may enter any weighting you like as long as the weightings add to 
100 percent, but I recommend that you enter the same inputs as those shown 
in Figure 8-11 so that you can check that the output is accurate.
A check total has been added for you already in cells G18 and A26.
FIGURE 8-10: 
Completed 
two-input  
data table.

172      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
3.	 Make sure that both column A and row 18 add to 100 percent, and add an 
error check that will alert the user if it does not because the model will 
be inaccurate if it does not tally.
You can do this as follows: In cell G19, enter the formula =1-G18, as shown in 
Figure 8-11, and in cell B26 add the formula =1-A26.
Now add the data table just as you did in the last section.
4.	 Link B19 to the output cell using the formula =’Summary’!B8.
5.	 Highlight the entire range B19:F25.
6.	 Select the What-if Analysis from the Data tab and choose Data Table from 
the options.
The Data Table dialog box appears.
7.	 Link the row field to the input field for the cost per unit (B5) and the 
column field to the input field for the sales price (B4) and compare your 
results to those in Figure 8-12.
After you’ve finished the data table, you need to multiply out the probability 
weightings into the table so that you can work out how likely each outcome is.
8.	 In cell H20, add the formula =C$18*$A20.
Don’t forget your mixed cell referencing (see Chapter 6).
FIGURE 8-11: 
Setting up the 
data table to add 
probability 
weightings.

CHAPTER 8  Applying Scenarios to Your Financial Model      173
9.	Copy this formula across the block of data to cell K25 and compare your 
results to those in Figure 8-12.
The total should add to 100 percent.
10.	Add an error check in cell L27 with the formula =1-L26.
When the data table and the probability weighting table have been built, you 
can use the results to calculate the probability weighted outcomes.
11.	In cell M20, add the formula =H20*C20.
There is no need to add cell referencing for this calculation.
12.	Copy this formula across the block of data to cell P25 and compare your 
results to those in Figure 8-13.
13.	In cell Q26, add the entire table together with the formula 
=SUM(M20:P25), as shown in Figure 8-13.
The calculated result is $5,202, which is the probability weighted predicted 
outcome of this model. If you’d like to see a completed copy of this model,

You can see from the examples in this section that data tables are a great way to look at 
multiple scenarios or sensitivity analyses one at a time. Instead of manually changing 
the sales price or the cost per unit, you can display at a glance the impact of these 
changes.
However, data tables have a couple of limitations that make them inappropriate for 
some scenarios or sensitivity analysis situations:
•	 The inputs and outputs need to be on the same page.
•	 You can show only two inputs and one output at a time. This is not a restriction with 
other forms of scenario analysis.
•	 Formula auditing (trace precedents and trace dependents) doesn’t work very well in 
data tables.
Data tables are extremely useful when you want to see the incremental change of one 
or two inputs on a single output. Data tables aren’t appropriate if the output of your 
financial model is a full set of financial statements, for example. In this situation, a drop-
down scenario would be best.

CHAPTER 8  Applying Scenarios to Your Financial Model      175
Using Scenario Manager to  
Model Loan Calculations
Scenario Manager is grouped together with Goal Seek and Data Tables in the 
What-If Analysis section of the Data tab. Being grouped with other tools that are 
so useful would lead you to believe that Scenario Manager is also a critical tool to 
know. However, despite its useful-sounding name and the good company it keeps, 
Scenario Manager is quite limited in its functionality and is as helpful as the name 
suggests! It’s therefore not frequently used by expert financial modelers; how-
ever, for the sake of completeness, I cover it here very briefly.
Setting up the model
To demonstrate how to use Scenario Manager, let’s apply it to a simple loan cal-
culation model. The theory behind loan calculations is quite complex, but fortu-
nately, Excel handles loans quite easily. For more information on modeling loans, 
interest amounts, and amortization schedules in financial models, see Chapter 6.
In the example shown in Figure 8-14, I’ve created an interest rate calculator upon 
which you can test the sensitivity of monthly repayments to changes in interest 
rates and loan terms. Follow these steps:
1.	 Download File 0801.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd, open it, and select the tab labeled 8-14, or simply set up the 
model with hard-coded input assumptions as shown in Figure 8-14.
2.	 In cell B11, type =PMT( and press Ctrl+A.
The Function Arguments dialog box appears.
The PMT function requires the following inputs:
•	 Rate: The interest rate.
•	 Nper: The number of periods over the life of the loan.
•	 Pv: The present value of the loan (the amount borrowed).
•	 Fv: The amount left at the end of the loan period. (In most cases, you want 
to pay the entire amount back during the loan period, so you can leave this 
blank.)
•	 Type: Whether you want the payments to occur at the beginning or the 
end of the period. (You can leave this blank for the purposes of this 
exercise.)

176      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
3.	 Link the fields in the Function Arguments dialog box to the inputs in your 
model.
The PMT function returns the annual repayment amount. Because you want to 
calculate the monthly repayment amount, you could simply divide the entire 
formula by 12, but because the interest is compounding, it’s more accurate to 
divide each field by 12 within the formula. So, the rate in the first field is 
converted to a monthly rate, and the number of periods in the second field is 
also converted to a monthly rate.
4.	 Click OK.
The formula is =PMT(B7/12,B9*12,B5).
This function returns a negative value because this is an expense. For our 
purposes, change it to a positive by preceding the function with the minus sign.
Applying Scenario Manager
Now you can use Scenario Manager to add some scenarios. You want to know the 
impact of changes in inputs on your monthly repayments. Follow these steps:
1.	 On the Data tab, in the Forecast section of the Ribbon, click the What-if 
Analysis icon, and select Scenario Manager from the drop-down list.
The Scenario Manager dialog box appears.

2.	 Click the Add button to create a new scenario.
The Add Scenario dialog box, shown in Figure 8-15, appears.
3.	 Enter a name for the first scenario in the Scenario Name box (for exam-
ple, Scenario One).
4.	 Enter the cell references for the variable cells in the Changing Cells box, 
as shown in Figure 8-15.
Separate each reference with a comma (if there is more than one), but don’t 
use spaces. You can also hold down the Ctrl key and click each cell in the 
spreadsheet to insert the references into the box.
5.	 Click OK.
The Scenario Values dialog box appears with the existing values (0.045 for the 
interest rate and 25 for the years).
6.	 Click OK to accept these values as Scenario One.
7.	 Click Add to add another scenario.
The Add Scenario dialog box appears again.
8.	 Enter a name for the second scenario in the Scenario Name box (for 
example, Scenario Two).

9.	Click OK.
The Scenario Values dialog box appears again.
10.	Enter the variables’ values for this scenario (for example, 0.05 for the 
interest rate and 30 for the years, as shown in Figure 8-16).
11.	Click OK.
You’re returned to the Scenario Manager dialog box.
12.	Follow Steps 7 through 9 again to create additional scenarios.
13.	After you’ve created all the scenarios, you can use the Scenario Manager 
to view each scenario, as shown in Figure 8-17, by clicking the Show 
button at the bottom.
The inputs are automatically changed to show the scenarios.
Scenarios are sheet-specific, meaning they only exist in the sheet where you 
­created them. So when you’re looking for the scenarios you’ve created, you have 
to select the correct sheet in the model.

THE LIMITATIONS OF SCENARIO MANAGER
Scenario Manager is fairly easy to build and use, but it’s a rudimentary tool that simply 
changes hard-coded numbers. It isn’t very easy to see, display, or print the different 
options unless you go into the Scenario Manager tool. Using the Summary tool creates 
a summary report of the scenarios created, but they aren’t dynamic or interactive, so 
they’re of little use as a modeling tool. The biggest downfall of Scenario Manager is  
that the user can’t see the results on the sheet unless she actually goes in to view the 
­scenarios.

Charting and Presenting 
Model Output
T
he final stage of the model building process is to present the outcome of the 
model. You’ve spent a lot of time on the calculations, making sure that the 
inputs and assumptions are correct and that all your scenarios are lined up 
ready for the decision makers to use. If you don’t present the outputs of the model 
clearly, however, the users won’t be able to understand what the model is show-
ing, so they might not use it or, even worse, they might use it and misinterpret 
what the model is saying.
A well-designed report or presentation is the best way to display the model results 
clearly and concisely and get its message across. The output and presentation of 
the results are just as important as the rest of the model-building process. There’s 
no point in having a beautifully designed, fantastically built model that none of 
the decision makers know (or care) about!
In this chapter, I walk you through conveying your model’s output to an audience 
to ensure all your modeling efforts are put to good use.
Chapter 9

182      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Deciding Which Data to Display
The output of your financial model may be very detailed and contain a myriad of 
numbers, colors, and confusing calculations. A common mistake is to try to put as 
much information as possible into one chart in an attempt to make it look impres-
sive. In reality, the chart just looks cluttered and fails to get the message across.
Charts are built for the purpose of presenting information that is easier to digest 
visually than the raw data. Sometimes two charts may be easier for your audience 
to digest than one chart. For some tips on designing the output layout and using 
colors, see Chapter 3.
If you’re not sure what data will look like visually, you can highlight it and press 
F11 to display an “instant chart” on a new tab.
Creating a summary sheet with visuals will help the viewer make sense of the 
financial model, but deciding which data to display is difficult. Your decision of 
what to show will depend on a couple of factors:
»
» What is your key message? Sometimes the reason that you built the 
financial model in the first place is to convey a particular message to the 
audience — for example, “Supply costs are escalating. We need to increase 
pricing or risk eroding profits.” In this example, you would show the supply 
cost per unit over time, versus the price over time, highlighting the key 
message for the decision maker.
»
» What is your audience interested in? Sometimes you’ve built a model for a 
particular purpose, but you know that the audience is particularly interested 
in a certain cost or ratio, so this is what you need to highlight in your output 
report.
Let’s look at the example shown in Chapter 8, where you create a five-year strat-
egy for a call center with three scenarios. You can download File 0901.xlsx at  
www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd and select the tab labeled 
9-1 to see the model shown in Figure 9-1.
The model calculates the costings for the next five years under different drop-
down scenarios. To create a summary of the model’s output, you have to decide 
which data to display. If you know that the audience is only interested in the cost-
ings section, you can create a chart based on the costings data at the bottom of the 
page, as shown in Figure 9-1. For instructions on how to build this chart, see the 
“Bar charts” section, later in this chapter.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      183
This case study is based on a simplified version of a model I built for a real-life 
client of mine. I know that the client was actually interested in the cost to serve 
each customer — finding this out was one of the purposes of building this model 
in the first place. So, add the cost per customer in row 24 with the formula =B21/B12 
and copy it across the row.
The chart shows the cost per customer, as well as the forecast number of custom-
ers, so you can see that although the number of customers increases steadily, the 
cost per customer fluctuates over the five-year period, as shown in Figure 9-2. 
For instructions on how to build this chart, see the “Combo charts” section, later 
in this chapter.

184      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
You can see in this case study that deciding which data to display can depend on 
what the message of the model is, as well as what the audience is interested in.
Conveying Your Message  
by Charting Scenarios
As I mention in Chapter 8, the major limitation of drop-down scenarios such as 
the one built in the preceding section is that you can’t see multiple scenarios side- 
by-side. The outputs of the five-year forecast model shown in Figure 9-2 only 
show the cost per customer under the base case scenario. To show the cost per 
customer under different scenarios, you need to change the scenario drop-down 
box in cell F1 — but you’ll only be able to look at one scenario at a time.
To add a data table that will allow you to see the cost per customer of all three 
scenarios side by side, follow these steps:
1.	 Add the three scenario names — “Best Case,” “Base Case,” and “Worst 
Case” — below the Cost per Customer, as shown in Figure 9-3.
Make sure that you spell the names correctly, and don’t add trailing spaces or 
the data table won’t work.
2.	 Select cells C2:E2 and press Ctrl+C.
3.	 Select cell A25, right-click, and select Paste Special ➪ Transpose to paste 
the names in cells A25:A17 with exactly the same spelling.
4.	 Highlight cells A24:F27 as shown in Figure 9-3.
5.	 On the Data tab of the Ribbon, in the Forecast group, select Data Table 
under the What-If Analysis button to display the Data Table dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 9-3.
Because the variable you’re changing is arranged in column A, you need to tell 
the Data Table dialog box where the original input is for the column, which is 
the Scenario cell in F1.
6.	 Under the Column input cell field, select cell F1, as shown in Figure 9-3.
You can only show one output in a data table, so you chose to show the cost per 
customer only. If you want to show other values, you need to create additional 
data tables.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      185
Now that you have the scenario results, they can be displayed in a line chart, as 
shown in Figure 9-4. For instructions on how to build this chart, see the “Line 
charts” section, later in this chapter.
The key message from this model can be seen in this chart. You can see that the 
cost per customer varies depending on the scenario, and the best case scenario 
doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll experience a lower cost per customer.
FIGURE 9-3:

data table.
FIGURE 9-4:

with chart.

186      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Because the data table needs to be arranged in a single block, you can’t insert a 
row above the scenario outputs to show that these are the results of the scenario 
analysis. You can change the formatting of row 24 and add the title “Scenario 
Analysis” in row 23 for clarity, as shown in Figure 9-4.
Deciding Which Type of Chart to Use
When deciding how to display the output of your model, you have a lot of choices, 
especially in the later versions of Excel because they keep adding new charts to 
standard Excel. Looking back through the financial models I’ve created in the past 
couple of years, around 80 percent of them contain only one of the following 
charts:
»
» Line or area chart
»
» Bar or column chart
»
» Combo chart
»
» Pie or doughnut (less frequently used)
As with most elements of building a financial model, charting the output should 
be clear and straightforward, simple and easy to understand. If you can get your 
message across in a simple way, that’s best. In some situations, though, you need 
to show more complex visualizations such as the following:
»
» Waterfalls
»
» Hierarchy charts, like Treemap and Sunburst, which are new to Excel 2016
Of course, many more charts are available in Excel, but in this section, I stick to 
these because they’re by far the most commonly used in financial modeling.
If you don’t want to create a whole line chart or bar chart to show your data, you 
can use a Sparkline instead. As I mention in Chapter 2, this is a new feature that 
was introduced in Excel 2010. It shows the trend of the data in a tiny line or bar 
chart that fits into a single cell, as shown in Figure 9-5. Sparklines can be accessed 
via the Sparklines section of the Insert tab on the Ribbon.
Deciding which chart type to use is often just a matter of trial and error. Take a 
look at the data in a few different ways and see which chart makes the most 
impact and tells your model’s story most effectively.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      187
When deciding which chart to choose, highlight the data, and select Recom-
mended Charts from the Charts section of the Insert tab on the Ribbon, as shown 
in Figure 9-6. This feature was introduced in Excel 2013, and it helps to visualize 
the data.
Line charts
Line charts are most appropriate for indicating trends. Like column charts, the 
simplicity of line charts makes them one of the favorites in displaying data. Column 
and line charts can be used interchangeably to display the same data, but line charts 
FIGURE 9-5: 
Sparklines.
FIGURE 9-6: 
Recommended 
Charts.

188      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
are normally used when there is a connection between the points on the x-axis, 
such as times or dates on a continuum. Line charts are best used for trending infor-
mation such as time series, and columns are better for showing comparisons.
In Excel, you also have stacked line and 100-percent stacked line chart options. 
Sometimes line charts convey information in a more meaningful manner when 
the data points are marked.
To build a line chart, such as the one shown in Figure 9-7, highlight the data, and 
simply select the first 2-D Line option from the Charts section of the Insert tab on 
the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 9-7.
The easiest way to add the labels on the x-axis in the chart in Figure 9-7 is to 
include the data in row 10 when creating the chart in the first place. To highlight 
data in nonconsecutive ranges, hold down the Ctrl key while highlighting with the 
mouse.
Move the chart across so that it isn’t obscuring the data behind it, and add a label.
Take a closer look at the chart you just built. It looks attractive, but which scenario 
is shown by which line? Grasping the meaning is difficult, particularly if you’re 
looking at the chart in black and white! Take a moment to put yourself in the 
viewer’s shoes and see if your message is unambiguously clear. Not really, is it? 
By putting the legend at the bottom — even if the colors are showing — it’s really 
difficult to figure out which line is which, so the viewer’s eyes need to go back-
ward and forward trying to understand the meaning.
FIGURE 9-7: 
Creating a  
line chart.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      189
Instead of using a legend at the bottom, let’s put the series names next to each 
line so that the chart will be easier to interpret. To do this, follow these steps:
1.	 Right-click one of the lines with the mouse.
2.	 Select Add Data Labels and then Add Data Labels again, as shown in 
Figure 9-8.
The data values appear. Don’t worry — we’re going to change that.
3.	 Click the label on the far right-hand side (the one with the value $2,324).
Make sure that’s the only one that’s been selected; otherwise, it won’t work 
properly.
4.	 Right-click the label, and select Format Data Label, as shown in Figure 9-9.
Note that it must say Label (singular), not Labels (plural), because that would 
mean the entire series has been selected, which isn’t what you want to do.
5.	 In the Format Data Label panel on the right side of the screen, check the 
Series Name box, and uncheck the Value and Show Leader Lines boxes.
The label “Worst Case” now appears next to the first line.
6.	 Click the rest of the data labels containing numbers on the line, and 
delete them one by one.
7.	 Repeat steps 1 through 6 with the Base Case and Best Case lines on the 
chart until each of the lines has its scenario label next to it, as shown in 
Figure 9-10.
FIGURE 9-8: 
Adding data 
labels to the

190      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
8.	 Adjust the chart sizing as necessary, and move the labels so that each is 
next to the correct line.
Don’t mix them up!
9.	 Remove the legend at the bottom of the chart and remove the gridlines if 
you wish by clicking them and pressing Delete.
Lining up the labels by hand is quite tricky. If you don’t get them aligned properly, 
it can look messy. Try holding down the Alt key when you move the label — this 
will “snap to grid,” which helps with alignment. Note that this method works with 
other objects such as whole charts, shapes, and images and in other programs, too.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      191
CHANGING A LINE CHART TO  
A STACKED AREA CHART
If the data you’re displaying is continuous, such as in a time series, but it needs to be 
stacked, you can consider using a stacked line or stacked area chart. In the example 
where the three scenarios are shown as alternatives to each other, stacking them on 
top of one another doesn’t make sense. If, however, you’re looking at profitability from 
different products, for example, and you want to see how much each product contrib-
utes to a total, then stacking the chart would make sense.
To demonstrate the use of a stacked area chart, take a look at the case study from 
Chapter 3 where you looked at the contribution of different bus routes to the total for 
the purpose of evaluating the different scenarios. You can download the model in File 
0302.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd.
To change a line chart to a stacked area chart, right-click the chart and select Change 
Chart Type. Select the Stacked Area option, as shown in the figure. 
Note that in this area chart, I’ve also added the series name to label each route as 
described earlier, in the “Line charts” section.

192      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Bar charts
Bar or column charts are one of the most commonly used chart types available in 
Excel, second only to perhaps the line chart in their use in financial modeling. Bar 
charts are most useful for comparing unrelated data points graphically. They’re 
very clear and easy to understand. When shown vertically, bar charts are some-
times called column charts. Horizontal bar charts represent exactly the same 
information as column charts from a different perspective. Most commonly, bar 
charts are used to represent time or future projections along the x-axis.
To build a simple bar chart with only one series, highlight the data, and simply 
select the first 2-D Column option from the Charts section of the Insert tab on the 
Ribbon.
To build a stacked bar chart, highlight all the data, including the series names and 
the years, as shown in Figure 9-11 (remember to hold down the Ctrl key to select 
nonconsecutive ranges), and select the stacked column (the second 2-D Column 
option) from the Charts section of the Insert tab on the Ribbon. Edit the title.
You may have noticed that there isn’t a lot of difference in terms of the design 
between a stacked bar chart and a stacked area chart (see the “Changing a line 
chart to a stacked area chart” sidebar). Which option you choose is a matter of 
personal preference. Play around with your chart, trying a number of different 
chart types to see which shows the data best.
FIGURE 9-11: 
Building a stacked 
bar chart.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      193
Some data visualization specialists advise against the use of a stacked column chart 
because it makes the top columns difficult to compare because the bases don’t start 
at the same value. I like to see the total amount as well as the breakdown, so 
although I appreciate that it can sometimes make comparison difficult, I still use 
ADDING A DATA TABLE TO A BAR CHART
Data shown visually will always get the message across more clearly to the viewer, but 
as a financial modeler, I also like to see the numbers. In a stacked bar chart like the one 
shown in the figure, displaying the numbers in a table below will add more information, 
which is appreciated by numbers people like me.
Note: A data table added below a chart should not be confused with a data table per-
formed for the purposes of sensitivity analysis, as described earlier in this chapter. Yes, 
Excel has two entirely different features with exactly the same name!
To add a data table to a chart, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the chart, and press the Chart Elements button on the right, as shown in 
the figure.
2.	 Check the Data Table option.
3.	 The legend is now showing in the data table, so delete the one at the bottom, 
which is no longer required.

194      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
stacked bar charts quite a lot when displaying the output of my financial models. 
You can try using a clustered column, such as the one shown in Figure 9-27, 
instead — that facilitates a better comparison. But with too many series, clustered 
columns can quickly become cluttered.
Combo charts
One of my favorite ways of showing different metrics in a single chart is to use a 
combination of bar and line chart types, which Excel calls a combo chart. I like 
combo charts because they can convey a lot of information without cluttering the 
chart. When you want to display as much information as possible in a small 
amount of space without making the graphic seem cluttered, combo charts are the 
answer.
You can also show correlations and make a point about cause and effect in your 
financial model simply and effectively with combo charts. For example, in the 
chart shown in Figure  9-12, the number of customers is increasing steadily, 
whereas the cost per customer changes erratically, making the point that just 
because demand increases, the cost per customer does not see any economies of 
scale as a result.
The combo chart does not appear on the Ribbon, so to build a combo chart, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Highlight the data, including the series titles (by holding down the Ctrl 
key to highlight nonconsecutive ranges) and select Recommended Chart 
from the Charts section of the Insert tab on the Ribbon.
The Insert Chart dialog box appears.
2.	 Click the All Charts tab.
3.	 Click the Combo icon at the bottom, and select the Clustered Column – 
Line on Secondary Axis option, as shown in Figure 9-12.
4.	 Select the Cost per Customer Secondary Axis check box, as shown in 
Figure 9-12.
Its data will now appear on the secondary axis on the right side of the chart.
5.	 Click OK.
6.	 Edit the colors and the chart title.
If you want to change the cost per customer to show on the primary axis (on the 
left instead of the right), select the Forecast Customers check box instead of the 
Cost per Customer check box in the dialog box shown in Figure 9-12.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      195
When you create the combo chart, the secondary y-axis (on the right-hand side) 
has automatically defaulted to starting at $2,140. This makes the difference 
between the years more noticeable, but it can be misleading so you might decide 
to change the axis to start at zero instead. To do this, double-click the numbers in 
the secondary axis (or right-click and select Format Axis) and when the Format 
Axis panel appears, change the Minimum bounds from 2410 to 0, as shown in 
Figure  9-13. Compare this to Figure  9-12. You can see that the chart has less 
impact when the axis starts at zero.
FIGURE 9-12: 
Building a  
combo chart.
FIGURE 9-13: 
Changing the 
y-axis to start

196      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Try not to clutter the chart by adding too many series and, as always, look at the 
chart from your viewers’ perspective and make sure your message is explicitly 
clear and understandable. In this example, it’s fairly clear which axis contains 
which value because the secondary axis is formatted with dollars. But to make it 
even clearer, you might consider adding axis titles, which you can find under chart 
elements.
Pie charts
Pie charts have also been vilified in recent years because they make it even more 
difficult than stacked bar charts to compare data. Comparing the sizes of the dif-
ferent “slices” of the pie is extremely difficult. Pie charts aren’t useful for com-
parison, or for time series. Particularly for dashboards where size is an issue, pie 
charts take up a lot of space without conveying much information. Pie charts are 
good, however, for displaying ratios or percentage information, such as market 
share or penetration. Pie charts are visually appealing, and I tend to use them 
when comparing only a few categories, such as male versus female.
To build a pie chart, highlight the data, including the series titles and simply 
select the first 2-D Pie option from the Charts section of the Insert tab on the Rib-
bon, as shown in Figure 9-14.
FIGURE 9-14: 
Building a  
pie chart.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      197
Edit the title, and you’re done! Well, not quite. Take a closer look at the chart. Is it 
really clear which slice is male and which slice is female? Female is shown on the 
right, and male is on the left, but the data labels are the other way around. This 
happens sometimes in Excel, and it’s not technically incorrect, but leaving the 
labels like this make it much more difficult for someone to interpret the meaning 
of your data. Readers need to look very carefully to see which slice is which.
Take time to check the outputs of the financial model, especially charts to make 
sure that the meaning and the message you want to get across can be easily inter-
preted by others.
You can edit this chart so that it’s easier to read and can be viewed properly in 
black and white by following these steps:
1.	 Click the chart, and click the Chart Elements button on the right, as 
shown in Figure 9-15.
2.	 Check the Data Labels option.
The value of each category appears on the pie chart.
3.	 Hover the mouse over the Data Labels option again, and click the arrow 
that appears to the right.
4.	 Select More Options.
The Format Data Labels panel appears at the right.
5.	 Check the Category Name, Value, and Percentage check boxes.
FIGURE 9-15:

6.	 Change the Separator to “(New Line).”
Each of the labels is put on a separate line.
7.	 The legend is no longer required, so delete the one at the bottom, and 
add a chart title.
CHANGING A PIE CHART TO  
A DOUGHNUT CHART
Doughnut charts are another way of displaying exactly the same information as a pie 
chart. To change your pie chart to a doughnut chart, follow these steps:
1.	 Right-click the chart and select Change Chart Type.
2.	 Select the Doughnut Chart option, which is on the far right of the Pie section, 
and click OK.
The data labels don’t look right, so play with some of the settings.
3.	 To change the size of the hole in the middle of the Doughnut, right-click the 
chart series and select Format Data Series, as shown in the figure.
4.	 Reduce the hole size to around 30%.
The Doughnut hole size can be found in the Format Data Series panel on the right.
5.	 Reposition the data labels if necessary.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      199
A doughnut chart is just a pie chart with a hole in the center. This difference may 
not seem significant at first, but this gap in the doughnut hole allows several 
series to be stacked in the same chart, which you couldn’t do with a pie chart. 
Although this feature looks visually appealing, it’s often misused and leads to 
confusing charts. To see this in action, add another series to the chart from earlier 
chart and overlay the male and female with the split between adult and children, 
as shown in Figure 9-16. This doesn’t really tell you very much. A Sunburst chart, 
described later in this chapter, would be more useful in this situation.
Charts in newer versions of Excel
The major change between Excel 2013 and Excel 2016 is the introduction of a 
number of new charts. With the increased popularity of data visualization and 
graphic display, Microsoft has kept up with competing business intelligence and 
data analysis software by making it easier to create popular chart types in Excel. 
For more information about competing software and changes in Modern Excel, 
see Chapter 2.
As with most new features of Excel, the new charts aren’t backward compatible. 
If, for example, you create a Sunburst in Excel 2016, and someone tries to open it 
in Excel 2013, the chart will simply show as a blank area. So, make sure that your 
users have the same version of Excel as you do if you’re planning to include newer 
Excel features such as these charts in your model.

Waterfall charts
Waterfall charts are very useful for displaying the output of financial models 
because they pull apart the pieces of a stacked chart and show their incremental 
effect side by side.
Take a look at the example shown in Figure 9-17. Showing an expense breakdown in 
a pie chart is not very helpful. Too many series are shown, and it’s very difficult to 
compare each section without the help of the percentages shown in the data labels.
This data is much better shown using a waterfall chart. Not only will you be able 
to see each of the cost categories side-by-side, but you’ll be able to view the rev-
enue amount and the margin as well for comparison. Download File 0901.xlsx 
from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd. Open it and select the 
tab labeled 9-18 or open a new workbook and enter the data as shown in 
Figure 9-18.
To build a waterfall chart, follow these steps:
1.	 Highlight all the data, including the labels and the margin, and select the 
Waterfall option from the Charts section of the Insert tab on the Ribbon, 
as shown in Figure 9-18.
2.	 Edit the title and change the colors.
3.	 Change the labels on the x-axis so that they’re orientated horizontally.
Showing labels at an angle makes the chart far more difficult to read. You may 
need to change the size of the chart to do this.
FIGURE 9-17:

recommended).

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      201
4.	 Remove the legend at the top.
Everything you need to know from this chart is shown in the labels already.
5.	 Set the margin amount as the total so that it shows the remainder only, 
as it does in Figure 9-19, by clicking the bar showing the margin, right-
clicking, and selecting the option Set as Total.
This moves the margin column down so that it shows correctly against the 
x-axis, as shown in Figure 9-19.
FIGURE 9-18:

FIGURE 9-19:

202      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
This waterfall chart won’t appear if the file is opened in Excel 2013 or earlier. For 
instructions on how to build a waterfall chart using a “dummy stack” or up/down 
bars that can be opened and used in any version of Excel, go to www.plumsolutions.
com.au/waterfalls.
Sunburst charts
The stacked doughnut chart shown earlier in this chapter doesn’t display gender 
and age data very well. If you have a hierarchical relationship within your data, 
you can use a hierarchical chart such as a Sunburst or Treemap.
To build a Sunburst chart, follow these steps:
1.	 If necessary, reorganize your data so that it sits within hierarchical 
categories, as shown in figure 9-20.
2.	 Highlight all the data, and select the Sunburst option from the Charts 
section of the Insert tab on the Ribbon.
3.	 Edit the title and change the colors.
4.	 Add the colors and edit the data labels, as shown in Figure 9-21.
FIGURE 9-20: 
Building a 
Sunburst chart.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      203
Treemap charts
A Treemap chart works in exactly the same way as the Sunburst, except that the 
segments are shown as squares instead of circles. The easiest way to change to a 
Treemap without having to change your settings again is to right-click the Sun-
burst, select Change Chart Type, and select the Treemap option, as shown in 
Figure 9-22.
FIGURE 9-21: 
A completed 
Sunburst chart.
FIGURE 9-22: 
A Treemap chart.

204      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Although the Sunburst and Treemap show exactly the same data, be sure to try out 
both types to see which looks best with your data. In this example, the Sunburst 
looks better visually. If you had a larger number of series, however, the Treemap 
would probably be easier to understand.
Dynamic Charting
When you’re creating charts in financial models or reports, you should still follow 
best practice and try to make your models as flexible and dynamic as you can. You 
should always link as much as possible in your models, and this goes for charts as 
well. It makes sense that when you change one of the inputs to your model, this 
should be reflected in the chart data, as well as the titles and labels.
Building the chart on formula-driven data
Take a look at the five-year strategic forecast model that you work on in the 
“Conveying Your Message by Charting Scenarios” section at the beginning of this 
chapter. Because the chart you built was based on formulas, the chart will auto-
matically change when the drop-down box is changed. Download File 0901.xlsx 
from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd. Open it and select the 
tab labeled 9-23 to try it out for yourself, as shown in Figure 9-23.
FIGURE 9-23: 
Changing the 
drop-down box.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      205
If you hide data in your source sheet, it won’t show on the chart. Test this by hid-
ing one of the columns on the Financials sheet and check that the month has 
disappeared on the chart. You can change the options under Select Data Source so 
that it displays hidden cells.
Linking the chart titles to formulas
Because all the data is linked to the drop-down box, you can easily create a 
dynamic title in the chart by creating a formula for the title and then linking that 
title to the chart. Follow these steps:
1.	 In cell A1 of this model, change the title to the following: =“Five Year 
Strategic Forecast Costs for Call Center - “&F1.
The ampersand (&) serves as a connector that will string text and values from 
formulas together.
Instead of the ampersand, you can also use the CONCATENATE function, which 
works very similarly by joining singular cells together, or the TEXTJOIN function 
is a new addition to Excel 2016, which will join together large quantities of data.
When you have the formula in cell A1 working, you need to link the title in the 
chart to cell A1.
2.	 Click the title of the chart.
This part can be tricky. Make sure you’ve only selected the chart title.
3.	 Click the formula bar.
4.	 Type = and then click cell A1, as shown in Figure 9-24.
5.	 Press Enter.
The chart title changes to show what is in cell A1.
You can’t insert any formulas into a chart. You can only link a single cell to it. All 
calculations need to be done in one cell and then linked to the title as shown.
Creating dynamic text
Take a look at the monthly budget report shown in Figure 9-25. We’ve already 
built formulas in columns F and G, which will automatically update as the data 
changes, and display how we’re going compared to budget. (To see how to build 
this model, turn to Chapter 7.)

206      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Now you’ll create a chart based on this data, and every time the numbers change, 
you’ll like to be able to see how many line items are over budget. Follow these 
steps:
1.	 Highlight the data showing the account, actual, and budget values in 
columns B, C, and D, respectively.
2.	 Select the first 2-D Column option from the Charts section of the Insert tab 
on the Ribbon to create a clustered column chart, as shown in Figure 9-25.
3.	 In cell A1, create a heading with a dynamic date (as described in the 
“Using dynamic dates” sidebar).
FIGURE 9-25: 
Creating a 
clustered 
column chart.
FIGURE 9-24: 
Linking the chart 
titles to formulas.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      207
4.	 Link the title of the chart to the formula in cell A1, as shown in the 
preceding section.
5.	 Edit the chart so that the titles are horizontally aligned and change the 
colors.
This chart will look much better if it’s sorted so that the larger bars are on the 
left side.
6.	 Highlight all the data including the headings, and click the Sort button 
(in the Sort & Filter section of the Data tab in the Ribbon).
The Sort dialog box appears.
7.	 Sort by Actual from largest to smallest, as shown in Figure 9-26.
It’s very easy to mess up formulas when sorting, so be sure that you highlight 
all the columns from columns A to G before applying the sort.
USING DYNAMIC DATES
Text containing a date can also be created in a single cell, and then linked to a title or 
text box in a chart. If you’d like the current date to always show on the chart, use the 
TODAY function in your formula, and format it using the TEXT function so that it shows 
the date in your preferred format.
Use the formula =“Monthly Budget Report for “&TEXT(TODAY(),”mmm yy”). Each time 
you open the file it will give you a title that includes the current month, such as “Monthly 
Budget Report for Nov 18,” assuming the current month is November 2018.
FIGURE 9-26: 
Sorting the  
chart data.

208      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Now, add some text commentary to the chart. You can do this by adding 
commentary in a single cell, which is dynamically linked to values in the model 
and link the cell to a text box to show the commentary on the chart.
8.	In cell A15, create a formula that will automatically calculate how many 
line items are over budget.
You can do this with the formula =COUNTA(G3:G12)-COUNT(G3:G12), which 
calculates how many non-blank cells are in column G. (For more information 
on how the COUNTA and COUNT functions work, see Chapter 7.)
9.	You can see that two line items are over budget, so convert this to 
dynamic text with the formula =COUNTA(G3:G12)-COUNT(G3:G12)&” 
Items over Budget” (see Figure 9-27).
10.	Insert a text box into the chart by pressing the Text Box button in the 
Text group on the Insert tab in the Ribbon.
11.	Click the chart once.
The text box appears.
12.	Carefully select the outside of the text box with the mouse, just as you 
did in the last section when linking the chart titles.
13.	Now go to the formula bar and type =.
14.	Click cell A15 and click Enter.
15.	Resize and reposition the text box as necessary.
FIGURE 9-27: 
Completed chart 
with dynamic  
text box.

CHAPTER 9  Charting and Presenting Model Output      209
16.	Test the model by changing the numbers so that more items are over 
budget, and make sure that the commentary in the text box changes.
Charting is an important part of the final stage of the model-building process. 
Make sure that the key messages from the model’s output are accurately pre-
sented by using clear, attractive, and unambiguous charts and tables.
Data visualization is a discipline that is increasingly growing in popularity, and not 
one that comes naturally to many with an analytical background  — like me! 
Although I readily admit that it doesn’t come naturally to me, I’ve spent a lot of 
time learning about these principles to improve the models and dashboards that I 
build for clients. If you can educate yourself on even the most basic principles of 
visual design and apply them to your work, you and your financial models will have 
greater credibility and recognition in your organization and amongst your peers.
Preparing a Presentation
You know your financial model best. No one is more qualified than you are to talk 
about your model, so you may be asked to communicate the results of the financial 
model as a formal presentation to the board or senior management. You need to 
decide how to communicate your findings in a clear and concise way. Understand-
ably, many detail-orientated modelers find that distilling their 20MB financial 
models that have taken weeks to build into a ten-minute presentation is difficult!
If you simply copy and paste a chart directly into Word or PowerPoint, the links to 
the underlying data in Excel will be maintained. This is fine if you’re planning to 
make changes, but it can make the file size very large, and could also lead to your 
accidentally sending confidential information unintentionally embedded into 
another document. To avoid this, you need to paste the chart as a picture. Copy the 
chart and then use Paste Special in the destination document to paste the chart as 
a picture or JPG.
In this kind of environment where you need to convey lots of information, having 
the summary tables or charts on a PowerPoint slide behind you while you’re 
speaking will be helpful. It can also help to take the focus off you if you’re a little 
bit nervous.
Your audience is probably not interested in seeing the workings of the model (and 
I don’t recommend showing those inner workings unless they’ve specifically 
requested it), but they might like to see live and changing scenarios. If the model is 
built correctly, you’ll be able to make a single change to the input assumptions, and 
the audience will be able to see the effects of these changing scenarios in real time.

210      PART 2  Diving Deep into Excel
Make sure that you test all possible inputs in advance. Having a #REF! error dur-
ing a live sensitivity analysis is a real confidence and credibility killer.
Whether you’re presenting in Excel or using PowerPoint slides, be sure to follow 
these basic rules of making financial presentations:
»
» Only display one key message at a time. Don’t crowd the screen with too 
much detail or try to convey too much at once.
»
» Use white space instead of gridlines. Gridlines create clutter and the less 
like a boring Excel spreadsheet your presentation looks, the better. You might 
love Excel, but many people in the audience will switch off when they see the 
gridlines, so make it look more like a presentation and less like Excel.
»
» Give them a more detailed report to look through after the presentation. 
Show only a high-level summary on the screen.
»
» Make sure the font is big enough and clear on the projector. Test it in 
advance if you can. Sometimes colors look washed out, making text difficult to 
read when projected.
»
» If you’re showing the model itself on the screen, increase the zoom in 
Excel so that your audience can see the numbers. Test this in advance, 
and remember that you’ll only be able to show a small portion of the screen 
in this way.
»
» Don’t jump around in Excel. Your audience isn’t as familiar with the model as 
you are. They’ll need some time to digest what they’re seeing.
»
» Use charts and graphics to display your message instead of text and 
numbers.
Be prepared for questions regarding the output, inputs, assumptions, or workings 
of the model. Make sure that you can defend the assumptions you’ve used or the 
way you’ve calculated something. The model output is only as good as the assump-
tions that have gone into it, so you need to make sure that the audience accepts 
the key assumptions in order for them to accept the model results.

Building an Integrated 
Financial Statements 
Model
F
 
inancial statements are the mainstay of many financial models. The financial 
statements consist of three reports:
»
» Income statement
»
» Cash flow statement
»
» Balance sheet
Some financial models might include only a profit-and-loss statement, some 
might include simply a cash flow statement, but many include all three. If a 
­financial model does contain all three, you might hear it referred as a three-way 
financial model.
What you really need to know about financial statements from a financial model-
ing perspective is that they should hang together and interrelate with each other 
with links. This is called an integrated financial statement.
Chapter 10

214      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Every output in a financial model is driven by inputs, and financial statements are 
no exception. So, it’s very important that when you change one of the inputs or 
assumptions in your model, the outputs change, too. For example, if you’ve fin-
ished building a financial model and your balance sheet balances, if you change 
one of the inputs (sales price, for example) the balance sheet should still balance. 
Of course, you’ll know right away if it doesn’t balance, because you’ve built in 
error checks (see Chapter 6).
I’ve seen many examples of financial statements that do not link to each other. 
This is simply poor modeling practice because if one of the inputs changes, all the 
financial statements will be out of sync with each other.
The best way for me to explain how financial statements link and fit together is to 
build one, of course, but before we do that, if you’d like a detailed description of 
each of the three statements and how each of them can help you to build, manage, 
and understand a business, turn to the sections later in this chapter: “Building the 
Income Statement,” “Building the Cash Flow Statement,” and “Building the 
­Balance Sheet.”
Getting to Know the Case Study
In this case study, you’re opening a small but what you hope to be busy cafe and 
applying for a business loan. The bank has asked you to put together a three-way 
financial model forecasting the business’s income, balance sheet, and cash flow. 
You’ll use all the tools and techniques covered in this book to build this financial 
model.
The bank has provided you with a general model template, but you have to create 
the model and project how your business will do in its first year. If you follow the 
steps as shown in this chapter, you’ll end up with a fully integrated financial 
model. You can download the blank model template called File 1001.xlsx at www.
dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd.
Start by opening the file and selecting the Balance Sheet tab.
In order to open and operate the cafe, you expect the business will need a $10,000 
coffee machine, $35,000 in furniture and fixtures, $5,000 in miscellaneous inven-
tory (such as cups and coffee), and $5,000 in cash. The total amount of $55,000 is 
how much money you need to open the business, also called your uses of funds.
Enter these numbers into your model, as shown in Figure 10-1.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      215
Now that you’ve determined how much money your business needs in order to 
start, you have to determine how you’ll fund this amount. This is called your 
sources of funds. Basically, you need to explain what you’re planning to do with the 
money, and where you’re planning to get it. In order to raise the required $55,000, 
you invest $25,000 in the form of equity (thanks, Ma and Pa) and borrow $30,000 
as a bank loan.
Your total sources of funds and uses of funds must always be equal. In other 
words, you have to raise enough money to fund what you purchase for the 
business.
Entering Assumptions
Now that you’ve figured out how to fund your business, you need to make future 
assumptions and project how the business will perform. You need to build a sepa-
rate Assumptions worksheet with your business projections that will drive the rest 
of the financial model.
The Assumptions worksheet already has places for your key business drivers — 
it’s up to you to input accurate and reasonable assumptions for the business.
In modeling, all input variables should be formatted consistently (usually with 
blue font or using Input Style, which can be found on the Home tab in the Styles 
section of the Ribbon). Then anyone using this model knows that she can make 
changes to any of the cells formatted in that way.
FIGURE 10-1: 
Sources and uses 
of funds.

216      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Revenue assumptions
Based on your study of other cafes in the area (you’ve been drinking a lot of coffee 
the past few weeks, haven’t you?), you expect the following assumptions for your 
business’s revenue:
»
» You’ll sell an average of 120 cups of coffee per day throughout the year.
»
» Forty percent of coffees sold will be in large cups; 60 percent will be in small 
cups.
»
» You’ll charge $4 for a large cup of coffee and $3.50 for a small cup of coffee.
These are your expectations for the business’s sales; they represent your base case 
revenue assumptions. You aren’t really sure whether you have the daily number of 
sales right — you’re just estimating — so you’ll adjust this number when you run 
the scenarios. You’ll address the best- and worst-case assumptions later on, after 
the base case is complete, so you can leave the cells in rows 3 and 4 blank for now.
Go to the Assumptions page, and enter the business sales, as shown in 
Figure 10-2.
The model has already been formatted for you, but when you make your own mod-
els, be careful to format correctly, expressing percentage values as percentages and 
using dollar signs to show dollar values. One of the most common errors in finan-
cial modeling is confusing units, such as treating a number of units as a price. 
FIGURE 10-2: 
Sales 
­assumptions.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      217
Proper formatting makes any report or model clearer and easier to read for the user. 
Pay particular attention to formatting when using percentages. If a cell is formatted 
as a percentage, any figure entered will automatically be converted to a fraction. 
For example, if you enter the number 5 in any normal cell, the value is 5. But if the 
cell is formatted as a percentage, the number 5 will automatically be converted to a 
value of 0.05 (or 5 percent). This could potentially lead to incorrect calculations.
Expense assumptions
In your analysis, you’ve also researched the operating costs of running a cafe, 
which are the following:
»
» You think the rent expense will most likely be $1,200 per month. This is just an 
estimate, though — you’ll enter some potential fluctuations into the scenario 
analysis later on.
»
» Consumables — including coffee beans, cups, filters, and so on — will cost you 
$0.45 per cup. This amount has been averaged over both large and small cups, 
so you won’t need to distinguish between size for the purpose of this model.
»
» The barista’s salary is $50,000 per year, plus 25% in other staff costs and 
benefits.
»
» Monthly utilities, such as electricity, heat, and water, will cost $100 per month.
»
» The company income tax rate is 30 percent.
These are your expectations for the business’s costs; they represent your base case 
expense assumptions.
Scroll down to the Expense Assumptions section on the Assumptions worksheet, 
and enter the assumptions as shown in Figure 10-3.
Other assumptions
Finally, you also have some other assumptions regarding the number of business 
days you’ll be open per month and how busy your cafe will be throughout the year, 
so you need to apply some seasonality because this will affect your cash flow. Fol-
low these steps:
1.	 Scroll down to the Other Assumptions section on the Assumptions 
worksheet, and based on next year’s calendar, complete row 32 for the 
number of business days per month, as shown in Figure 10-4.
2.	 Based on historical seasonal and weather patterns, complete row 33 for 
the seasonality variance, as shown in Figure 10-4.

218      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Models must be well documented and assumptions must be clearly stated. A prop-
erly documented model will not only help you and others follow it, but also help 
users if you’re no longer around when a change needs to be made to the model. 
Including sources is handy for when you or someone else wants to go back and 
FIGURE 10-3:

assumptions.
FIGURE 10-4: 
Other 
­assumptions.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      219
check the validity of your assumptions. Document assumptions and sources as 
you build the model. Documenting as you go is much easier than having to go back 
and do it at the end. After all, a model is only as good as its assumptions!
Calculating Revenue
Now that you’re happy with your assumptions, you can use them to calculate the 
revenue of the business for the next year.
Projecting sales volume
You know that your base case assumption is that the cafe will sell 120 cups of 
­coffee per day, so you need to multiply this assumption by the monthly seasonal-
ity to arrive at the number of cups sold per day in each month. Follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Revenue worksheet and select cell B5.
In this cell, you’re going to enter a formula to calculate the total number of 
cups of coffee.
2.	 Type =.
3.	 Go to the Assumptions worksheet and select cell B9.
4.	 Press F4 to lock the reference.
You need to anchor this reference because as you copy the formula across, 
you don’t want B9 to change to another cell. For more information about cell 
referencing, see Chapter 6.
5.	 Stay on the Assumptions worksheet and multiply this reference by the 
monthly seasonality assumption by typing * and selecting cell B34.
There is no need to anchor the seasonality reference because you want the 
reference to change as you copy it along the row.
6.	 Press Enter to finish the formula.
Your formula will look like this: =Assumptions!$B$9*Assumptions!B34. The 
calculated result is 96.
7.	 Copy this formula across the row by selecting cell B5, pressing Ctrl+C, 
selecting cells C5 through M5, and pressing Ctrl+V or Enter.

220      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
You have the total number of cups sold per day. Now you need to project how 
many of these cups are large and how many are small based on your assumptions. 
You’re going to use the calculated value of 96 and split it into large and small 
cups, based on your assumed split between large and small on the Assumptions 
worksheet. Follow these steps:
1.	On the Revenue worksheet, select cell B6 and type =.
2.	Go to the Assumptions worksheet, select cell B12, and press F4 to lock the 
reference.
3.	Multiply this value by typing *.
4.	Go back to the Revenue worksheet and select cell B5.
5.	Press Enter to finish the formula.
Your formula will look like this: =Assumptions!$B$12*Revenue!B5. The 
calculated result is 38.
6.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
You’re going to repeat this process to find the number of small cups.
7.	On the Revenue worksheet, select cell B7 and type =.
8.	Go to the Assumptions worksheet, select cell B13, and press F4 to lock the 
reference.
9.	Multiply this value by typing *.
10.	Go back to the Revenue worksheet and select cell B5.
Your formula will look like this: =Assumptions!$B$13*Revenue!B5. The 
calculated result is 58.
11.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
12.	On the Revenue worksheet, select cell B8 and enter the formula 
=SUM(B6:B7).
If you prefer, you can use the AutoSum function or the shortcut Alt+=. The 
calculated result is 96.
13.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
14.	Perform a sense-check by highlighting both cells B6 and B7.
If you look at the status bar, the SUM will equal 96, the total number of cups 
sold per day.
Go one step further than sense-checking and add an error check in row 9.
15.	In cell B9, enter the formula =B8-B5 and copy it across the row.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      221
Always sense-check your numbers as you build a model. Don’t leave it to the end 
to check your numbers. Never take the number given for granted. Work it out in 
your head and use a calculator to make sure your numbers look right. This will 
help you make sure the numbers you’ve calculated are correct. When you’re sure 
the numbers are right, add in an error check if you can just like you did in row 9. 
A good financial modeler is always looking for opportunities to put error checks 
into their models. For more information about error checks, see Chapters 6 and 13.
Projecting dollar sales
Now that you’ve projected how many cups and sizes you’ll sell per day in each 
month, it’s time to translate this into actual dollar sales figures. Follow these 
steps:
1.	 On the Revenue worksheet, select cell B12 and multiply B6 (the number 
of large cups sold per day in January) by the price per large cup with the 
formula =B6*Assumptions!$C$12.
The calculated result is $154.
2.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
3.	 On the Revenue worksheet, select cell B13 and multiply B7 (the number 
of small cups sold per day in January) by the price per small cup with the 
formula =B7*Assumptions!$C$13.
The calculated result is $202.
4.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
5.	 Add the sum total in cell B14 with the formula =SUM(B12:B13)
The calculated result is $355.
6.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
You now have sales per day figures for large cups, small cups, and total cups 
for each given month. In order to find each month’s total sales, you must 
multiply daily sales by the number of business days per month.
7.	 On the Revenue worksheet, select cell B15 and multiply the daily sales 
figure in cell B14 by the number of business days in January with the 
formula =B14*Assumptions!B32.
Note that you don’t need to press F4 to add any cell referencing because you 
want the cell references to copy across. The calculated result is $7,814.
8.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
You’ve now projected your monthly sales for the year! Check your totals 
against Figure 10-5.

222      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Calculating Expenses
Now that you’ve projected your revenue, it’s time to project your expenses for the 
business.
Staff costs
Your assumption for the barista’s annual salary is $50,000, so your annual pro-
jection should be divided by the 12 months of the year to arrive at the monthly 
amount. Follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Expenses worksheet and select cell D5.
2.	 Enter the formula =Assumptions!$B$20 and then press F4 to lock the 
reference.
3.	 Enter /12 in order to divide the annual salary by 12 months.
4.	 Press Enter to complete the formula.
The formula will be =Assumptions!$B$20/12. The calculated result is $4,167.
5.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
You’ve also assumed that it will cost an extra 25 percent of the barista’s salary 
to cover other staff costs and benefits. Calculate this amount next.
FIGURE 10-5:

calculations.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      223
6.	 On the Expenses worksheet in cell D6 enter the formula 
=D5*Assumptions!$B$21.
The calculated result is $1,042.
7.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
Make sure the formatting is correct. Often when you multiply a value by a 
­percentage, Excel resets the formatting to show more decimals. If this happens, 
press Decrease Decimal in the Number section of the Home ribbon.
Your staff costs should total $5,208 every month of the year, shown in row 7.
Other costs
Now you need to calculate your other costs, like rent and utilities. Follow these 
steps, starting with rent, which has a base case assumption of $1,200 per month:
1.	 On the Expenses worksheet, select cell D9, enter the formula 
=Assumptions!$B$23, and press F4 to lock the reference.
The calculated result for rent is $1,200.
2.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
Your assumption for utilities is $100 per month.
3.	 On the Expenses worksheet, select cell D10, enter the formula 
=Assumptions!$B$24, and press F4 to lock the reference.
The calculated result for utilities is $100.
4.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year
Your assumption for consumables expenses is an average of $0.45 per cup. 
You need to multiply this amount by the number of cups sold per month. You 
haven’t calculated the number of cups sold per month, so you need to do this 
in the formula, too.
5.	 On the Expenses worksheet, select cell D11 and enter =Revenue!B8*Assum
ptions!B32*Assumptions!$B$17.
This formula multiplies
•	 The number of cups sold per day in January on the Revenue worksheet in 
cell B8
•	 The number of business days in January on the Assumptions worksheet in 
cell B32
•	 The cost of consumables per cup on the Assumptions worksheet in cell B17

224      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
The calculated result is $950.
Note that only the reference for the consumables per cup needs to be 
anchored as an absolute reference, because the other references need to 
change as you copy the formula across the row.
6.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
Your costs should total $7,459 for January. You’ve just projected your cash 
expenses for the business! Check your totals against Figure 10-6.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses are non-cash expenses used in 
accounting. They represent the cost of a long-term fixed asset, like property, 
plant, and equipment (PP&E), that is steadily allocated as an expense over the 
useful life of the asset. Because the business is generating revenue from this asset 
over an extended period of time, it makes sense to apportion the expense over the 
period of time for which it is going to be used.
So, for example, the coffee machine will cost you $10,000 and you expect it to last 
for three years. From an accounting perspective, it wouldn’t be accurate to put the 
entire amount in the expenses on the income statement for the first month of 
operation because your income statement would show that you’d be making a 
huge loss in the first month and a huge profit thereafter. It makes more sense to 
FIGURE 10-6: 
Completed 
expense 
calculations.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      225
spread the cost across the entire life of the assets because that will accurately 
reflect the costs of purchasing the coffee machine.
Amortization refers to the depreciation of intangible or nonphysical assets the 
company might hold on its balance sheet, such as goodwill, trademarks, or pat-
ents. For this example, your business only holds tangible assets so you only need 
to calculate the depreciation, not amortization.
When you decide that a large item of expenditure is an asset, rather than an oper-
ating expense, you need to put the cost of the asset onto the balance sheet and 
begin to depreciate it, which will be shown on the income statement. When you do 
this, the balance sheet changes as does the profitability shown on the income 
statement. The cash flow statement remains unchanged (because you need to pay 
for the item in any case). The process of taking a large item of expenditure and 
putting it onto the balance sheet rather than showing it on the income statement 
is called capitalization.
When you capitalize an asset, the ongoing depreciation on the income statement 
affects the business’s taxable income; there are all sorts of accounting rules and 
regulations that differ between regions about how large an asset needs to be 
before it can be capitalized and over how many years it should be depreciated.
The most common method of depreciation is the straight-line method, which 
means that the asset is depreciated equally over its useful life. For more informa-
tion on other methods of depreciation and how to calculate them in Excel, see 
Chapter 9 of my book Using Excel for Business Analysis: A Guide to Financial Modelling 
Fundamentals, Edition Revised for Excel 2013 (Wiley).
You’re going to make the assumption that your coffee machine ($10,000) will be 
depreciated over three years, and the furniture and fixtures ($35,000) will be 
depreciated over ten years. Using the straight-line method, you can calculate the 
depreciation simply by dividing the cost of the asset by the number of years. You 
need to enter this amount into the model to determine its depreciation.
You’ve already entered the capital costs on the Uses of Funds section on the bal-
ance sheet, so you can reference these numbers to build your depreciation sched-
ule. Follow these steps:
1.	 On the Expenses worksheet, enter the useful life of the coffee machine  
(3 years) in cell C20 and the useful life of the furniture and fixtures (10 
years) in cell C21, as shown in Figure 10-7.

226      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
2.	 Select cell B20 and enter the formula =‘Balance sheet’!K11.
This formula links this cell to the purchase price of the coffee machine on the 
Balance Sheet worksheet. The calculated result is $10,000.
3.	 Select cell B21 and enter the formula =‘Balance sheet’!K12.
This formula links this cell to the assumed furniture and fixtures amount on 
the Balance Sheet worksheet. The calculated result is $35,000.
Finally, you have to figure out the monthly depreciation and amortization 
expense using the straight-line method. This is done by dividing the cost of the 
long-term asset by its useful life to find the annual depreciation expense, and 
then dividing by 12 to find the monthly expense.
4.	 In cell D20, enter =B20/C20/12.
This formula divides the price of the coffee machine ($10,000) by the useful life 
(3 years) and then converts it to monthly by dividing it by 12. The calculated 
result is $278. Don’t worry about the cell referencing just yet.
Although financial modeling best practice tells you to never hard-code a 
number into a formula, entering 12 for the number of months is okay because 
it’s not a variable that is likely to change in the near future!
Because you can copy this formula down to the next row as well as across the 
page, you can save time by making use of mixed cell referencing.
5.	 Go back into your formula in cell D20 and add a dollar sign before the 
column referencing; the formula should now be =$B20/$C20/12.
You can do this by manually typing it in, or click within each cell reference and 
press the F4 shortcut key three times. The calculated result is still $278.
6.	 Copy this formula across the row as well as down to row 21 to calculate 
the depreciation for both assets for the entire year.
7.	 Add the sum total in row 22 using the formula =SUM(D20:D21) and copy it 
across the entire row.
The calculated result for each month is $569.
You’ve just projected your depreciation costs for the business. Check your 
totals against Figure 10-7.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      227
Building the Income Statement
The income statement, also called the profit-and-loss (P&L) statement, shows 
the underlying profitability of the company — in other words, exactly how much 
money the business is making. This information is useful for the purposes of cal-
culating taxes; it also helps the owner or manager run the business. Of all the 
three statements that make up the financial statements, the income statement is 
the simplest to understand because it simply shows the revenue earned by the 
business and the operating costs associated with generating that revenue for the 
business.
The income statement is usually more detailed than the other statements, so when 
building a financial model from scratch, you’ll normally tackle this one first.
One of the things that differentiates the income statement from the other finan-
cial statements is that each column refers to only one period. Most income state-
ments are built on a monthly basis; some are also annual. With a cash flow or a 
balance sheet, you need to carry over the amount from the previous period, but 
with an income statement, each period starts fresh.
An income statement can also be used as a tool to compare current performance 
with past months or years, tracking the performance of the business, and provid-
ing a basis from which to create a forecast or budget. The model you’re building is 
for the purpose of budgeting the projected income for the business over the next 
12 months for the bank, and the income statement is a critical component.
FIGURE 10-7:

expenses 
including 
depreciation and 
amortization.

228      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
All income statements follow a similar format:
Revenue
–
Cost of Goods Sold
=
Gross Profit
–
Expenses
=
Operating Income or Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, 
and Amortization (EBITDA)
–
Depreciation and Amortization
=
Earnings before Interest and Tax (EBIT)
–
Interest
=
Earnings before Tax (EBT)
–
Tax
=
Net Income
You don’t need to be an accountant to build a financial model, but you do need to 
be familiar with basic accounting concepts, and the format of an income state-
ment is about as fundamental as it comes. If you don’t lay out an income state-
ment in this order, your model will lose all credibility.
Most of these line items you’ll find in the income statement for the financial 
model you’re building in this chapter, but cost of goods sold is not relevant for a 
business like yours, so it isn’t shown on your income statement. Some income 
statements may differ between companies and not show every single line item. 
For example, EBT is sometimes not shown, and the income statement jumps 
directly from EBIT to net income, without showing the earnings before tax has 
been applied.
Operating income or EBITDA is useful for knowing what the underlying profit-
ability of the company is before you deduct tax, interest, depreciation, and amor-
tization. EBITDA is sometimes used for company valuations because it gives 
managers, shareholders, and other interested parties a better indication of how 
the company is doing before other elements relating to the capital structure of the 
company come into play. Similarly, EBIT takes into account the depreciation and 
amortization but does not include interest and tax. Some managers’ key perfor-
mance indicators (KPIs) and other targets are set based on EBIT or EBITDA because 
these items cannot be controlled easily by management.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      229
Now that you know the basics of an income statement, you need to build one! For 
simplicity’s sake, the income statement will go on the same worksheet as the cash 
flow: the IS Cash Flow worksheet.
If you’ve been following along with this chapter from the beginning, you’ve 
already projected most of the income statement line items. The first part of the 
income statement simply requires you to “pull through” the revenue and expense 
summary lines by linking them to the Revenue and Expenses worksheets. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Go to the IS Cash Flow worksheet, select cell C5, and enter the formula 
=Revenue!B15.
This links cell C5 to cell B15 on the Revenue worksheet. The calculated result  
is $7,814.
2.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
3.	 Select cell C7 and enter the formula =Expenses!D7.
This links cell C7 to cell D7 on the Expenses worksheet. The calculated result  
is $5,208.
4.	 Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
5.	 Select cell C8 and enter the formula =Expenses!D12.
This links it to cell D12 on the Expenses worksheet. The calculated result  
is $2,250.
CALCULATING PROFIT MARGIN
We use the components of the income statement for ratio analysis, too. For example, 
one of the most useful ratios is profit margin (also called return on sales or gross profit 
ratio), which gives a very useful indication of how the company is doing. To calculate 
profit margin, use the following formula:
Profit Margin
Profit before Tax
Revenue
The profit margin is one of the many ratios that investors and creditors use to check the 
financial health of a company. Dividends and returns are paid from profit, so if an investor 
buys shares in the company, how likely is it that he will receive dividends? Banks or other 
creditors use the profit margin to see whether they’re likely to get their money back.
See the exercise in Chapter 6 for a practical example of calculating the profit margin 
ratio.

230      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
6.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
7.	Calculate the sum total in cell C9 with the formula =SUM(C7:C8) and copy 
it all the way across the row.
8.	In cell C11, calculate the EBITDA by deducting the expenses from the 
revenue with the formula =C5-C9.
The calculated result is $356.
9.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
10.	Select cell C13 and enter the formula =Expenses!D22.
This links cell C13 to cell D22 on the Expenses worksheet where you calculated 
the depreciation earlier. The calculated result is $569.
11.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
12.	In cell C14, calculate the EBIT by deducting the depreciation and amorti-
zation from the EBITDA with the formula =C11-C13.
When the depreciation and amortization have been deducted, the cafe is 
making a loss for the first month. The calculated result is –$214.
13.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
The bank loan you’re applying for carries a 7 percent annual interest rate that 
you’ll pay monthly. In order to calculate the interest payable, you need to pick 
up the loan amount from the Balance Sheet worksheet and the interest 
amount from the Assumptions worksheet.
14.	Still on the IS Cash Flow worksheet, select cell C16 and link it to the 
Balance worksheet tab by typing =, selecting the amount of the loan in 
cell K3, and pressing F4 to lock the reference. Then multiply it by the 
interest rate in cell B26 on the Assumptions worksheet, and lock the 
reference by pressing F4.
The formula is = ‘Balance Sheet’!$K$3*Assumptions!$B$26/12 and the 
calculated result is $175.
This formula multiplies the borrowed amount in cell K3 on the Balance Sheet 
worksheet by the annual interest amount in cell B26 on the Assumptions 
worksheet and divides it by 12 to convert it to a monthly amount.
The formula calculated result is $175.
15.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
To calculate your tax expense, you need to multiply your EBT by your tax rate 
of 30 percent.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      231
16.	Select cell C19 and link this to the EBT by entering the formula 
=C17*Assumptions!$B$27.
17.	Press F4 to lock the reference.
The calculated result is –$117.
Notice that the tax is a negative value, which forms a tax credit. When a 
business reports a negative net income, also called a net loss, these losses are 
tax deductible, and the business benefits from a tax benefit when this 
happens. Although the business won’t realize the credit right away because tax 
is not paid every month, you still need to show the calculated tax amount each 
month in order to derive an accurate profit amount.
18.	Copy this formula across the row to calculate this for the entire year.
You may need to adjust the decimal formatting.
19.	In row 20, enter the formula =C17-C19.
This formula calculates the net income by deducting the tax from the EBT. The 
calculated result is –$272.
Be sure to get your plus and minus signs around the right way! Mixing up the 
positives and negatives is the most common error on a financial statement.  
Go over the logic of your income statement carefully, and make sure the tax is 
either positive or negative, depending on whether you’ve made a profit or a loss.
20.	Select cell O5 and press Alt+=.
This automatically sums up the entire year with the formula =SUM(C5:N5). The 
calculated total is $111,755.
21.	Copy this down the column to row 20 to add up the totals for each line.
By simply copying and pasting the formula down the column, it will copy the 
cell format as well as the formulas. Use Paste Formulas to copy only the 
formulas, and leave the formatting as it is.
To use Paste Formulas:
a.	 Copy cell O5 onto the clipboard and press Ctrl+C.
b.	 Highlight cells O5:O20 with the mouse.
c.	 Right-click with the mouse, and select the Paste Formulas icon under 
Paste Options.
22.	Look down the column and remove the unnecessary zero values in rows 
6, 10, 12, 15, and 18. Select these cells and press Delete.
You’ve just completed the income statement — your first financial statement 
for the business! Check your totals against Figure 10-8.

232      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Building the Cash Flow Statement
Cash is king! When running a business like this — particularly a new business — 
you should never ever run out of cash. You may have a business that’s highly 
profitable, but if you can’t pay your staff next month, then you don’t have a busi-
ness. For this reason, cash flow is the most important out of all the financial 
statements.
A cash flow statement helps to plan your business’s cash flow, which identifies 
and eliminates shortfalls or surpluses in cash projections. If you find your cash 
flow is projecting a shortfall, you need to alter the business’s financial plans in 
order to provide more cash. You can arrange an overdraft from the bank, adjust 
inventory, or take other measures that will free up some more cash. If your cash 
flow forecast reveals surplus or excess cash, it might mean you’re borrowing too 
much or that you have idle money that could be invested. The objective is to keep 
the business with a cash reserve that is large enough for unknown eventualities 
but small enough that it doesn’t waste cash sitting in a low-interest account that 
could otherwise be put to better use. Keeping tabs on your cash flow with a well-
built and regularly updated cash flow model is imperative for avoiding cash flow 
problems.
Profit and cash flow don’t necessarily go hand in hand. Cash flow is actual cash 
coming in and out of your bank account; profit is the underlying profitability of the 
business. You can have a very profitable business, but if you don’t have the cash 
to pay wages at the end of the month, the business won’t last very long.
FIGURE 10-8: 
The completed 
income 
­statement.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      233
Often the discrepancies between cash flow and profit are due to timing differ-
ences. If you were to take a large number of orders for a new product for which the 
customer had not paid a deposit, you would need to purchase raw materials, hire 
staff, or outlay other expenditure in order to fulfill that order. If you’ve sent the 
customer the invoice, but the terms of credit to the customer were, say, 60 days, 
then that means you won’t receive any payment for the goods until 60 days after 
the goods have been received by the customer. In the meantime, you’ve had to pay 
staff and possibly pay for raw materials, so cash flow is going to be a problem until 
that invoice is paid. Because you’ve already sent the customer the invoice, the 
funds will show on that month’s income statement, but the cash won’t turn up for 
another two months. Your income statement will look healthy, but you’ll run into 
problems with cash flow unless you’re able to arrange funding from elsewhere 
until the invoice is paid. A good financial model will help identify and mitigate 
these potential problems.
To model the cash flow, start with the opening cash balance, add income, and 
deduct outflows from payments. This will give you an idea of whether you have a 
surplus or a deficit for that period. If financing is needed, you’ll add that as an 
amount coming into the bank account, and then calculate any repayments or 
interest payable going forward. The closing balance of one period becomes the 
opening balance of the next period, like a corkscrew, as shown in Figure 10-9.
When calculating a cash flow forecast for the cafe model, you need to consider 
these differences between cash flow and profit. You’ve built an income statement 
already, so you can use this as a base, making a few key adjustments in order to 
calculate cash flow. To begin forecasting the cash flow for the new business, you 
need to outline the initial flows of cash when opening the business in the Pre-
Open column.
Capital expenditures (CapEx) represent funds that are spent to acquire, upgrade, 
or replace physical assets such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). Capital 
expenditures are often used to invest in equipment for new projects or maintain 
FIGURE 10-9: 
Corkscrew cash 
flow modeling.

234      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
old ones. The coffee machine and furniture and fixtures that the cafe needs  
to open are PP&E, so the purchases of these assets are classified as capital 
expenditures.
Getting your starting position right is important, because it will affect the entire 
statement. Unlike the income statement, any changes in prior months will flow  
on and affect the balances in later periods because of the “corkscrew” nature of 
cash flow.
The starting point for the cash flow statement is the pre-open amounts in column 
B. The starting cash balance (the amount you have in the bank before opening the 
doors) is $5,000, and this is made up of the following:
»
» $5,000 in purchased inventory (consumables such as cups, coffee, milk, and 
so on that you need to purchase prior to opening the café). Note this is a 
purchase and will, therefore, be expressed on the cash flow statement as a 
negative value.
»
» $45,000 in CapEx for the coffee machine ($10,000) and furniture and fixtures 
($35,000). This is also cash out, so it’s shown as a negative value on the cash 
flow statement.
»
» $30,000 for the money you received from bank loan.
»
» $25,000 for the capital raised.
You need to calculate the pre-open by entering the amounts as just described. 
Although you may be tempted to type these numbers in, it’s very important that 
you follow financial modeling best practice by only entering data once. All these 
numbers have already been entered into your model, so you must access them, or 
“pull them through,” by linking from other parts of the model — in this case, the 
balance sheet. If you simply type the numbers in, this model will cease to be a fully 
integrated financial model, because any changes made won’t be reflected in the 
calculations.
Follow these steps to pull the numbers through:
1.	 On the IS Cash Flow worksheet, in cell B30, enter the formula =–’Balance 
sheet’!K10.
This formula links cell B30 to the –$5,000 for inventory from the uses of funds 
on the Balance Sheet worksheet. No need to anchor the cell referencing this 
time because you aren’t copying this formula across.
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are not material in this model, so 
you won’t include the calculations, but you’ll leave the lines there (rows 31 and 
32) to show where they go if you want to come back later and add them in.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      235
2.	 In cell B35, enter the formula =-’Balance sheet’!K11-’Balance sheet’!K12.
This formula links cell B35 to the $45,000 in CapEx to where you entered them 
on the uses of funds on the Balance Sheet worksheet. You need to add them 
up but because you need a negative value, you’re prefacing the formula with a 
minus sign after the equal sign, and deducting it rather than adding it. The 
formula gives the total of –$45,000.
3.	 In cell B38, enter the formula =‘Balance sheet’!K3.
This formula links cell B38 to the $30,000 amount you expect from the bank 
loan to where you entered it on the sources of funds section of the Balance 
Sheet worksheet.
4.	 In cell B39, enter the formula =‘Balance sheet’!K4.
This formula links to the $25,000 amount you’ve raised from where you 
entered it on the sources of funds section of the Balance Sheet.
5.	 Calculate the closing cash in cell B42 with the formula =SUM(B26:B41).
The calculated value is $5,000, which is what we expect it to be. This represents 
the amount of working cash your business needs to operate.
6.	 You need to calculate the closing cash for each month on this statement, 
so copy this formula all the way across the row to calculate this for the 
entire year.
Even though the values are now zero, they’ll update as you fill in the cash flow 
statement.
Closing cash will represent the opening cash for the next month, so you need 
to link your opening cash amount to the balance from the prior month.
7.	 In cell C26, enter the formula =B42.
8.	 Copy this formula all the way across the row to calculate this for the 
entire year.
The calculated value for each month is $5,000, which is not yet correct, but 
these cells will update as you fill in the cash flow statement.
Your net income from the income statement also represents cash inflows, but 
not all income statement items are cash expenses. Revenues, operating 
expenses, interest, and taxes are all cash expenses, but D&A expenses are 
accounting expenses that don’t represent cash outflows. So, not only should 
you add your net income as a cash inflow, but you should also add back your 
D&A expense that you subtracted from net income earlier.
9.	 Link the net income in cell C28 to the net income calculated farther up 
the page with the formula =C20.
The calculated value is –$272.

236      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
10.	Link the D&A (noncash) amount in cell C29 to the D&A expense calculated 
farther up the page with the formula =C13.
The calculated value is $569.
11.	Copy the formulas in rows 28 and 29 across the rows to calculate for the 
entire year.
Because you’ve already entered the opening and closing balances into the cash 
flow statement, these will automatically update.
You have just completed the cash flow statement! Check your totals against 
Figure 10-10.
Building the Balance Sheet
The accounting equation as shown on the balance sheet is perhaps the single most 
important concept to understand in terms of financial statements modeling:
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity
Let’s take a look at each of these components:
»
» Assets: All property owned by the company. This includes cash in the bank, 
factories, materials, and even money you’re owed. You can think of assets as 
the resources that are used to generate revenue.
FIGURE 10-10: 
The completed 
cash flow 
statement.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      237
Assets are split into two categories:
•	 Current assets: Current assets can be easily converted into liquid assets or 
cash. This includes assets such as stocks and shares, account receivables 
(money that is owed to the company), and stock that will sell soon for cash.
•	 Fixed assets: Fixed assets are still property owned by the company, but 
they may take longer to convert into liquid assets. This includes large 
capital items such as factories or equipment, as well as nonphysical assets 
such as intellectual property or goodwill.
»
» Liabilities: All debts owed. Similarly, current liabilities are short-term debt 
that needs to be paid back within a year, such as accounts payable (money 
you owe to suppliers), credit card debt, or overdrafts. Long-term liabilities are 
more formal borrowings such as bank loans.
»
» Shareholders’ equity: What the owner has after all the debt has been  
repaid. If the company were sold, theoretically, this is what the shareholders 
would have.
The balance sheet shows the financial position of a company at any given moment. 
Just as with the income statement, the elements of a balance sheet need to be 
arranged in a specific order:
ASSETS
Current Assets
Fixed Assets
LIABILITIES
Current Liabilities
Long-Term Liabilities
EQUITY
Common Stock
Additional Paid in Capital
Retained Earnings
TOTAL EQUITY
TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY
Now that you’ve projected your income and cash flow, you need to complete your 
balance sheet and connect all three financial statements.

238      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Your cafe’s beginning balance sheet at Year 0 will be tied to your sources and uses 
of funds. Your uses of funds will be your starting assets, and your sources of funds 
will represent your liabilities and equity. Breaking down the concepts, your uses 
of funds are assets that you’re purchasing in order to operate the business. Your 
sources of funds are how you fund the purchases of said assets — money can be 
raised through liabilities that you owe, such as a bank loan, or it can be equity 
invested by an owner (in this case, you!).
Start with the current assets (which for your business consists of your cash) and 
inventory. Follow these steps:
1.	 On the Balance Sheet worksheet, select cell B5 and enter the formula =‘IS 
Cash Flow’!B42.
This formula links cell B5 to the closing cash amount you calculated in the last 
section on the cash flow statement. This represents the starting cash of $5,000 
your business has on hand.
2.	 Select cell B6 and enter the formula =K10.
This formula links cell B6 to the working inventory on the uses of funds you 
entered earlier on the same worksheet. This represents your starting inventory 
amount of $5,000.
3.	 Leave accounts receivable in cell B7 blank, and sum the current assets in 
cell B8 with the formula =SUM(B5:B7); copy the formula across to the 
second year.
4.	 Select cell B11 and add cells K11 and K12 on the same worksheet with the 
formula =K11+K12.
The calculated value is $45,000. This represents your starting PP&E.
5.	 Leave depreciation in cell B12 blank for now and sum the fixed assets net 
of depreciation with the formula =SUM(B11:B12); copy it across to the 
second year.
6.	 Sum the current and fixed assets in cell B15 with the formula =B13+B8; 
copy it across to the second year.
This gives you the calculated total asset value of $55,000.
7.	 Leave row 20 blank because you don’t have any current liabilities at this 
point.
8.	 Select cell B23 and enter =K3.
This formula links cell B23 to the bank loan amount of $30,000 you entered 
earlier into the sources of funds section on the same worksheet. This repre-
sents the amount you have borrowed from, and owe to, the bank.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      239
9.	Sum total long-term liabilities in cell B24 with the formula =SUM(B23) and 
copy it across to the second year.
It may seem strange to only sum one number, but it’s important to do so for 
consistency. If at a later date you add other rows for long-term liabilities, they’ll 
also be included in this total.
10.	Select cell B27 and enter the formula =K4.
This formula links cell B27 to the $25,000 equity amount raised that you 
entered earlier in the sources of funds section on the same worksheet. This 
represents the amount you’ve invested and your equity in the business.
11.	Row 28 relates to retained earnings, which will come from the profit 
shown on the income statement.
This is not relevant for Year 0 because you haven’t yet begun operations.
12.	Sum total the liabilities and equity in cell B31 with the formula =B29+B24, 
and copy it across to the second year.
You know that total assets must be equal to liabilities and equity in order for 
the balance sheet to balance, so this is a perfect opportunity to include an 
error check.
13.	Add an error check in cell B32 with the formula =B31-B15 and copy it 
across to the second year.
Now that you’ve completed the balance sheet for the pre-open year, you need 
to link your balance sheet to the income and cash flow statements to deter-
mine what the balance sheet will look like after the first year of operations.
The cafe’s cash at bank will change by the amount of cash flow from your cash 
flow statement. You’ve already calculated this on a monthly basis, and you 
have a closing cash figure at the end of December of Year 1.
14.	Go back to the top of your balance sheet, select cell C5, and link it to the 
closing cash balance of $19,624 on the IS Cash Flow worksheet with the 
formula =‘IS Cash Flow’!N42.
15.	In cell C11, enter the formula =-SUM(‘IS Cash Flow’!C35:N35).
This formula calculates the total amount of fixed assets on the books at the 
end of the second year. If you’ve purchased additional assets during the year, it 
will show on the cash flow statement, so you need to link that through with the 
formula. Note that any CapEx purchases on the cash flow statement are 
shown as negative values so you need to add a minus sign to the beginning of 
the sum to show it as a positive value. The total will be zero at this point, but 
that may change in future iterations of these financial statements.
You also need to add the existing fixed asset amount of $45,000 carried over 
from the previous year.

240      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
16.	Add this amount to the beginning of the formula you already have in C11 
so that it looks like this: =B11-SUM(‘IS Cash Flow’!C35:N35).
Note that fixed assets need to be shown at their original cost (regardless of 
whether they’ve increased or decreased in value since purchase) and then the 
accumulated depreciation is shown on a separate line to give us the total 
written-down value of the asset at that point in time. A long-term asset like the 
ones shown here will be depreciated until it’s worth nothing on the balance 
sheet at the end of its useful life.
Because the fixed assets’ value is depreciated, you need to pick up the D&A 
amount already calculated on the income statement.
17.	Select cell C12 and enter the formula =-’IS Cash Flow’!O13.
You need to enter the minus sign because D&A subtracts from gross PP&E.
18.	Check your totals.
The total amount of D&A expensed throughout Year 1 is $6,833, total fixed 
assets is $38,167, and total assets is $62,791.
Moving on to liabilities, in cell C23 you need to take into consideration any 
paying down of debt that may have occurred during the year. If there is any, it 
would show up in the cash flow on row 40.
19.	Although there isn’t any at the moment, you should still link this row 
through to the balance sheet with the formula =SUM(‘IS Cash Flow’!C40:N40).
The calculated value is zero.
20.	You then need to add the bank loan carried over from the previous year, 
so adjust the formula in cell C23 to =B23+SUM(‘IS Cash Flow’!C40:N40).
The calculated value is $30,000.
21.	For owners’ funds in cell C27, simply carry this over to the next year with 
the formula =B27.
Finally, your retained earnings represent the amount of economic profit, or net 
income, your business has earned that has been retained in the company. This 
can be kept in the company to reinvest in the business or pay down debt, or it 
can be paid out as dividends to shareholders.
22.	Select cell C28 and link it to cell O20 on the IS Cash Flow worksheet with 
the formula =‘IS Cash Flow’!O20.
The calculated value is $7,791 and represents the total net income earned 
throughout the year.
Congratulations! You’ve linked all three financial statements. Check your totals 
against Figure 10-11 and make sure that you perform a balance sheet error check to 
see if your total assets equal your total liabilities and equity, and thus balances.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      241
The balance sheet check is the most important one because it’s the most common 
place where an error will surface due to the many moving pieces that all need to 
be correct in order for both sides of the balance sheet to balance. Many times, the 
error will be between the balance sheet and cash flow statement and may be 
because of an incorrect minus or positive value. When trying to reconcile a balance 
sheet that does not balance, I find it helpful to remember that the total assets 
must be equal to the total liabilities and equity, so if I add an item to the assets 
side of the equation, I need to add an amount of the same value to the other side 
of the equation.
Building Scenarios
Now that you’ve determined your base case assumptions that reflect how you 
believe the business will perform, you also want to run worst-case and best-case 
scenarios. Not only do you want to see how you believe the business will do, but 
you also want to see how the business will perform if it does worse than expecta-
tions or better than expectations.
Running multiple scenarios is a very important part of financial modeling — some 
would say it’s the whole point of financial modeling — because it allows the user 
FIGURE 10-11: 
The completed 
balance sheet.

242      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
to gauge the different outcomes if certain assumptions end up being different. 
Because no one can see into the future and assumptions invariably end up being 
wrong, being able to see what happens to the outputs when the main assumption 
drivers are changed is important.
Because you’ve built this integrated financial model such that all the calculations 
are linked either to input assumption cells, or to other parts of the financial state-
ments, any changes in assumptions should flow nicely throughout the model. The 
proof is in the pudding, however. In this section, you see what happens when you 
make major changes to this model with scenario analysis!
Entering your scenario assumptions
Going back now to the Assumptions worksheet, you believe that the main drivers 
of profitability for your cafe will be the average number of cups you sell per day 
and the rent you’ll pay. You believe that reducing cups sold per day by 20 cups and 
increasing rent by 10 percent is a reasonable worst-case scenario, and increasing 
cups sold per day by 20 cups and reducing rent by 10 percent is a reasonable best-
case scenario.
At the very top of the Assumptions worksheet, enter the scenario input assump-
tions as shown in Figure 10-12.
Building a drop-down box
You’ve decided on your scenario assumptions, so now you need to build a drop-
down box, which is going to drive your scenario analysis. You have a full, working 
financial model, so you want the ability to easily switch between your scenarios to 
see how the outputs change in real time. You can put the scenario drop-down box 
on either of the financial statements, but for this example you’ll put it at the top 
of the income statement.
FIGURE 10-12: 
Scenario input 
assumptions.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      243
Follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the IS Cash Flow worksheet and select cell B1.
2.	 Select Data Validation in the Data Tools section of the Data Ribbon.
The Data Validation dialog box appears.
3.	 From the Allow drop-down list, select List.
You could type the words Best, Base, and Worst directly into the field, but it’s 
best to link it to the source in case you misspell a value. To review how to use a 
data validation drop-down box, turn to Chapter 6.
4.	 In the Source field, type = and then click the Assumptions worksheet, and 
highlight the scenario names Worst, Base, Best.
Your formula in the Source field should now be =Assumptions!$B$2:$D$2, as 
shown in Figure 10-13.
5.	 Click OK.
6.	 Go back to cell B1 on the IS Cash Flow worksheet, and test that the 
drop-down box is working as expected and gives the options Best, Base, 
and Worst.
7.	 Set the drop-down box to Base for now.
FIGURE 10-13: 
Building the 
scenario 
drop-down box.

244      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Building the scenario functionality
You need to edit your input assumptions for number of cups sold per day and 
monthly rent so that as the drop-down box on the IS Cash Flow worksheet 
changes, the input assumptions change to the corresponding scenario. For exam-
ple, when Best has been selected on the IS Cash Flow worksheet, the value in cell 
B9 on the Assumptions worksheet should be 140, and the value in cell B23 should 
be $1,080. This should be done using a formula.
Often, many different functions will achieve the same or similar results. Which 
function you use is up to you as the financial modeler, but the best solution will be 
the one that performs the required functionality in the cleanest and simplest way, 
so that others can understand what you’ve done and why.
In this case, there are several options you could use: a HLOOKUP, a SUMIF, or an 
IF statement. In my opinion, the IF statement, being a nested function, is the 
most difficult to build and is less scalable. If the number of scenario options 
increase, the IF statement option is more difficult to expand. In this instance, I 
have chosen to use the HLOOKUP with these steps.
Follow these steps (and see Chapter 7 for more information on HLOOKUP):
1.	 Select cell B9 and press the Insert Function button on the Formulas tab or 
next to the formula bar.
2.	 Search for HLOOKUP, press Go, and click OK.
The HLOOKUP dialog box appears.
3.	 Click the Lookup_value field, and select the drop-down box on the IS Cash 
Flow worksheet.
This is the criteria that drives the HLOOKUP.
4.	 Press F4 to lock the cell reference.
In the Table_array field, you need to enter the array you’re using for the 
HLOOKUP. Note that your criteria must appear at the top of the range.
5.	 Select the range that is the scenario table at the top — in other words, 
B2:D4 — and the press F4 to lock the cell references.
The cell references will change to $B$2:$D$4.
6.	 In the Row_index_num field, enter the row number, 2.
7.	 In the Range_lookup field, enter a zero or false, because you’re looking 
for an exact match.
8.	 Check that your dialog box looks the same as Figure 10-14.

CHAPTER 10  Building an Integrated Financial Statements Model      245
9.	Click OK.
The formula in cell B9 is =HLOOKUP(‘IS Cash Flow’!B1,$B$2:$D$4,2,0) with the 
calculated result of 120.
10.	Perform the same action in cell B23 with the formula =HLOOKUP(‘IS Cash 
Flow’!$B$1,$B$2:$D$4,3,0).
Instead of re-creating the entire formula again, simply copy the formula from 
cell B9 to cell B23 and change the row reference from 2 to 3. Copying the cell 
will change the formatting of the number, so you’ll need to change the 
currency symbol back to $ again.
11.	Go back to the IS Cash Flow worksheet and change the drop-down to Best.
Check that your assumptions for average number of cups sold per day and 
monthly rent on the Assumptions worksheet have changed accordingly. Cups 
will have changed to 140 and rent to $1,080.
Now, the important test is to see if the balance sheet still balances!
12.	Go back to the Balance Sheet worksheet and make sure that your error 
check is still zero.
13.	Test the drop-down again by changing it to Worst.
Cups will have changed to 100 and rent will be $1,320. Check the error check 
on the Balance Sheet worksheet again.
Congratulations! Your entirely integrated financial model, together with scenario 
analysis, is now complete! You can download a copy of the completed model in

Building a Discounted 
Cash Flow Valuation
T
he discounted cash flow (DCF) model is one of the most commonly used 
methods of finding the value of a company or any other cash flowing asset. 
In fact, many other methods of valuation — such as cash flow multiples and 
the leveraged buyout model  — are proxies or derivatives of the DCF model. 
Normally, modelers use the DCF when trying to decide what the value of an asset 
is. For example, you may be considering purchasing a company or a large piece of 
equipment and want to know what the value of the asset is for you.
DCF calculations are normally an add-on to an existing, working financial model, 
but in order to use the DCF method to arrive at a value for the asset, you need to 
make sure that the model contains the following three pieces of information:
»
» Free cash flow to the firm, or the information necessary to calculate this
»
» Weighted average cost of capital
»
» Perpetuity growth rate (an assumption)
In this chapter, I explain how to pull out the pieces of information you need in 
order to calculate value using the DCF method. Of course, before you do so, you 
Chapter 11

248      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
need to make sure that you have all the necessary inputs. If you didn’t build the 
financial model that contains the information you’ll be using, make sure that you 
understand the information you’ve been given and that the financial model is cor-
rect. For more information, see Chapter 5.
Understanding How the Discounted  
Cash Flow Valuation Works
The core concept of the DCF is that of the basic finance concept of the time value of 
money, which states that money is worth more in the present than the same 
amount in the future. In other words, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar 
tomorrow.
The idea behind the time value of money is that if you have to wait to receive your 
funds, you’re missing out on other potential investment opportunities, not to 
mention the risk of not receiving the money at all. If you have to wait to get your 
money, you’d expect some compensation — hence, the concept of interest. For 
example, if you invest $100 at a 10 percent annual interest rate today, it will be 
worth $110 in one year. Conversely, $110 in one year would only be worth $100 
today. In this example, the 10 percent is referred to as the discount rate. As the 
name suggests, the discount rate is a key input you need to calculate the DCF.
A DCF valuation uses a modeler’s projections of future cash flow for a business, 
project, or asset and discounts this cash flow by the discount rate to find what it’s 
worth today. This amount is called the present value (PV). Excel has a built-in 
function that automatically calculates PV.
If you want to know the math behind the function, here’s how to calculate PV, 
where CF is the cash flow for the projected year, r is the discount rate, and n is the 
number of years in the future: 
PV

In the case of a project or asset with finite cash flows, the modeler would forecast 
all the cash flows and discount them to find the present value. For example, if you 
were purchasing an asset such as a large piece of machinery that has an expected 
life of ten years, you would model the entire ten years. When purchasing a busi-
ness, however, which is expected to be a going concern and the cash flows are 
expected to continue into perpetuity, a DCF analysis must find a terminal value at 
the end of a certain forecast period instead of forecasting cash flows into eternity.

CHAPTER 11  Building a Discounted Cash Flow Valuation      249
The terminal value represents the projected value of the company or asset at the 
end of the forecast period. Forecast periods are typically projected to the point at 
which cash flows are expected to grow at a stable and predictable rate. When the 
cash flows become stable, you can then reasonably estimate a fair value for the 
steady cash flows that are earned after that point in time.
There are variations of the DCF analysis in which the cash flows, discount rates, 
and terminal values can differ, but the most common method is to project free 
cash flow to firm, find a terminal value using the perpetuity growth method, and 
discount these values by the business’s weighted average cost of capital.
For the case study in this chapter, assume that you’ve been provided with the 
projected financial model containing the financial statements for a company. It’s 
your responsibility to perform a DCF analysis to arrive at a valuation for the busi-
ness and ultimately a fair value for its equity shares.
Download the file File 1101.xlsx from www.dummies.com/go/financialmodeling 
inexcelfd, open it, and spend a few minutes reviewing and familiarizing yourself 
with the financial statements. If you’ve completed the case study in Chapter 10, 
you’ll recognize these financials. In Chapter 10, you build a financial model con-
taining a full set of integrated financial statements, covering a 12-month period. 
To perform a DCF analysis, however, you need several years of financial state-
ments, which are provided in this new model.
Step 1: Calculating Free Cash Flow to Firm
The DCF will discount projected free cash flow that the business will earn, also 
called the free cash flow to firm (FCFF). A business’s FCFF represents the cash flows 
the business will earn, disregarding cash flows associated with the capital struc-
ture, such as interest expense, debt paydown, dividends, or capital raises. The DCF 
yields the value of the whole business.
The financial model provided in File 1101.xlsx has a projection period of seven 
years for the business and includes the Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, 
and Balance Sheet for this period. Your job is to calculate the projected FCFF and 
then use this to calculate the DCF.
There are different variations of the DCF that may use a different FCFF to discount. 
For instance, a levered free cash flow DCF may project a future capital structure for 
the business and project a free cash flow to equity (FCFE), which accounts for costs 
of financing like debt interest and paydown. In this chapter, I explain the more 
common method of discounting FCFF.

250      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Although there are different ways to arrive at FCFF, a common equation derived 
from net income is the following:
Free Cash Flow to Firm = Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization and Other 
Noncash Charges + Interest * (1 – tax rate) – Capital Expenditures + Change in 
Working Capital
To calculate FCFF, follow these steps:
1.	 Add depreciation and amortization and other noncash charges to the net 
income.
These noncash expenses do not represent actual cash outflows from the 
business. Depreciation and amortization is the most common noncash 
expense to add back, but all other noncash expenses found in the income 
statement should be added back as well.
2.	 Add the interest expense to the number you arrived at in Step 1.
You add back the interest because you have to disregard the charges associ-
ated with the capital structure and debt. Because interest expense is tax-
deductible on the income statement, you need to add back interest adjusted 
for the taxes saved by its deduction.
3.	 Subtract capital expenditures from the amount you arrived at in Step 2.
Capital expenditures and long-term investments are real cash outflows for the 
business that are required to keep the business going and properly invested in 
for the future.
4.	 Add the working capital to the amount you arrived at in Step 3.
Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current 
assets and includes line items like inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts 
payable. These items are continually required on the balance sheet for the 
business to operate. If more working capital is required due to an inventory 
increase, this represents a cash outflow because the business will need to 
spend cash to purchase said inventory. Conversely, if less working capital is 
required due to an increase in accounts payable (the ability to pay vendors 
later), this represents a cash inflow for the business.
Now that you know how to arrive at FCFF from net income, you need to link these 
projected line items from the included financial statements. On the DCF tab of the 
model you have open, you’ll find these labels in cells A14:A19. Follow these steps:
1.	 Select cell C14 and link it to the Year 1 Net Income in the Income and 
Cash Flow tab using the formula =‘IS Cash Flow’!C27; copy this formula 
across the row.

CHAPTER 11  Building a Discounted Cash Flow Valuation      251
2.	 Select cell C15 and link it to the Year 1 Depreciation & Amortization in the 
Income and Cash Flow tab using the formula =‘IS Cash Flow’!C13; copy 
this formula across the row.
3.	 Select cell C16 and link it to the Year 1 Interest and multiply it by (1 – Year 
1 Tax Rate) in the Income and Cash Flow tab using the formula =‘IS Cash 
Flow’!C19*(1-’IS Cash Flow’!C25); copy this formula across the row.
You’re adding back interest and tax-adjusting it to account for the tax savings 
of the expense.
4.	 Select cell C17 and link it to the Year 1 Capital Expenditures in the Income 
and Cash Flow tab using the formula =‘IS Cash Flow’!C45; copy this 
formula across the row.
5.	 Select cell C18 and sum all Year 1 Working Capital cash flows in the 
Income and Cash Flow tab, including increases in inventory, accounts 
receivable, and accounts payable using the formula =SUM(‘IS Cash 
Flow’!C38:C40); copy this formula across the row.
6.	 Select cell C19 and sum all these cash flow adjustments including Net 
Income, D&A, Interest, Capital Expenditures, and Changes in Working 
Capital to arrive at FCFF using the formula =SUM(C14:C18); copy this 
formula across the row.
You’ve just completed the FCFF calculation, your first step in the DCF analysis. 
Check your totals against Figure 11-1.
FIGURE 11-1: 
Calculating FCFF.

252      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Step 2: Calculating Weighted  
Average Cost of Capital
The most common discount rate used for a FCFF DCF is the company’s weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC), which is the company’s cost of capital weighted by 
how much debt and equity it has:
WACC = (Proportion of Equity × Cost of Equity) + (Proportion of Debt × Cost of Debt, 
Less Tax)
The cost of equity, or the return required by the market in exchange for owning the 
company’s equity, is multiplied by the percentage of the business’s capital struc-
ture that is equity. The cost of debt, or the interest required by lenders in exchange 
for lending money to the company, is similarly multiplied by the percentage of the 
business’s capital structure that is debt. The cost of debt is also multiplied by 1 
minus the tax rate because interest is tax-deductible, which effectively lowers the 
cost of having debt by the amount of tax savings.
In this case study, you have a capital structure made up of 45 percent debt and 
55 percent equity. You need to multiply each of these by the cost of equity and the 
market rate of the debt to come up with the WACC for the company. Follow these 
steps:
1.	 Select cell B3 and link it to the Year 1 amount of Long-Term Debt of 
$30,000 in the Balance Sheet tab using the formula =‘Bal Sheet’!$C$28.
2.	 Select cell C3 and link it to the Year 1 amount of Equity of $36,320 using 
the formula =‘Bal Sheet’!$C$34.
3.	 Select cell B4 and divide the amount of debt by the sum of debt and 
equity and lock the reference in the divisor, with the formula =B3/
SUM($B$3:$C$3); copy the formula across to cell C4.
Now you have the percentage of the capital structure that is debt and equity.
Assume that the Year 1 capital structure is the current optimal long-term mix 
of debt and equity for the business. Because capital structures constantly 
change, when you build your own financial model you’ll want to consider the 
optimal or most common long-term capital structure for the business under 
the current conditions.
To arrive at your cost of debt, you must take your interest expense and 
multiply it by 1 minus the tax rate to adjust for the tax deductibility of interest.

CHAPTER 11  Building a Discounted Cash Flow Valuation      253
4.	 Select cell B5, link it to Year 1 interest, and multiply the interest by 
(1 – Year 1 Tax Rate) in the Income and Cash Flow tab using the formula 
=‘IS Cash Flow’!C20*(1-’IS Cash Flow’!B25).
You have determined that investors in this business and similar small busi-
nesses require a 15 percent return to own the equity.
5.	 In cell C5, enter 15% as a hard-coded input value.
6.	 Select cell B6 and multiply the cost of capital for debt and equity by their 
respective percent of the capital structure and add them together to find 
the business’s WACC with the formula =B4*B5+C4*C5.
The calculated value is 10.2 percent. Check your totals against Figure 11-2.
Step 3: Finding the Terminal Value
Now you need to find the terminal value of the business at Year 7, the end of the 
projection period. There are many ways to estimate a terminal value of cash flows, 
but the most common method is using the perpetuity growth method. This uses a 
formula to find the value of steadily growing cash flows into perpetuity:
Terminal value
FinalYear s FCFF
1
Growth
WACC
 Growth
’
This formula assumes a constant rate by which the cash flows will grow into per-
petuity and values the cash flows accordingly. So far in this case study, you know 
the FCFF because you calculated it in Step 1. You know the WACC because you 
FIGURE 11-2: 
Calculating  
the WACC.

254      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
calculated it in Step 2. You don’t know the perpetuity growth rate, and this is sim-
ply an assumption and should be a sustainable rate that you think the company 
can continue to grow forever after, usually in the range of 1 percent to 5 percent, 
but let’s use 2 percent in this case.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Return to your model and enter 2% in the input cell B8 on the DCF sheet.
2.	 Select cell I20 and enter the terminal value formula =I19*(1+B8)/(B6-B8).
You’re multiplying Year 7 FCFF by (1 + Growth) and then dividing this equation 
by (WACC – Growth). The calculated value is $264,994. This is the terminal value 
and represents the value of the business in Year 7.
Discounting Cash Flows and Valuation
Now that you’ve found the business’s FCF, terminal value, and discount rate, it’s 
time to value the business. Follow these steps:
1.	 Select cell C21 and enter the formula =SUM(C19:C20); copy this formula 
across the row.
This formula sums cells C19:C20 to arrive at the total cash flows to discount.
2.	 Select cell B23 and enter the formula =NPV(B6,C21:I21).
This uses the NPV function to discount the cash flows, telling you what the 
series of cash flows over the seven-year future period is worth today, based on 
the assumed WACC. The first reference of the NPV (in B6) is your discount rate 
or WACC, and the second part of the formula is the total cash flows to discount.
By discounting all the FCFF and terminal value, you have arrived at enterprise 
value, or the value of the whole business disregarding the capital structure. 
This value is $215,460. In order to find the value of the equity, you must add 
the cash the business currently has and subtract the debt the business 
currently owes to lenders.
3.	 To add the cash, select cell B24 and link it to Year 0 Cash at Bank in the 
Balance Sheet tab with the formula =‘Bal Sheet’!B6.
4.	 To add the debt, select cell B25 and enter =-’Bal Sheet’!B28.
You want to show this as a negative value, so preface the formula with a minus 
sign. Compare your values to those in Figure 11-3.

CHAPTER 11  Building a Discounted Cash Flow Valuation      255
5.	 Select cell B26 and enter the formula =SUM(B23:B25).
You should have now arrived at an equity value of $192,960. In order to find a 
target share price, you must divide the equity value by the number of shares 
outstanding. The business has 5,000 shares outstanding.
6.	 Select cell B28 and enter 5,000.
7.	 Select cell B29 and enter the formula =B26/B28.
The calculated value is $38.59.
Check your totals against Figure  11-3. You’ve now found the fair value of the 
­business (enterprise value), its equity (equity value), and its stock price!

Budgeting for Capital 
Expenditure and 
Depreciation
T
he last two chapters deal with building financial models at quite a high 
level. In this chapter, you delve into more detail in one part of a financial 
model: the capital expenditure (CapEx).
In Chapter  10, I explain the process of purchasing assets and calculating their 
depreciation. For example, you purchased a coffee machine, as well as fixtures and 
fittings. These purchases were reflected in your cash flow statement, but you also 
needed to calculate their depreciation based on their useful life. You used this 
amount in the Income Statement and showed it on the Balance Sheet in order to 
show the current value of fixed assets. The way this was calculated was fairly 
simple.
In this chapter, I explain in more detail how to model depreciation. Here, you take 
a list of existing and budgeted CapEx items, convert them into a cash flow 
schedule, calculate the depreciation, and use the depreciated amounts to calculate 
the written-down value on the Balance Sheet. You also see what happens when an 
asset is fully depreciated and how to model this.
Chapter 12

258      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Getting Started
In this case study, you’re charged with assembling the CapEx component for the 
coming year’s IT budget. You’ve managed to pull from the fixed assets register a 
list of assets, the purchase price, and the purchase date. You also have a wish list 
of items your department wants included in the next budget. You use the informa-
tion you have to model the cash flow and the depreciation.
It’s always a good idea to start a modeling project with the end in mind. The 
­outputs that you want to show in this model are the following:
»
» Output 1: Cash required for asset purchases over the budget period (for the 
cash flow statement)
»
» Output 2: Depreciation for the budget period (for the income statement)
»
» Output 3: Written-down value of assets for the budget (for the balance sheet)
You can download the blank template, File 1201.xlsx, at www.dummies.com/go/
financialmodelinginexcelfd. The Calculations tab contains the data you already 
know and is designed for changes to be made by the user (a colleague or client who 
is not necessarily expected to understand how the model works) or yourself at a 
later date. The Assumptions tab contains assumptions you know; anything else 
you think of during the model-building process can be documented here as well.
The first thing you need to do is enter the time frames. Almost every model has an 
element of time series data, and it’s important to get this right from the start. You 
need to decide at what level of time series detail the model should be built. For 
more information on modeling time frames, see the section in Chapter 3. Most 
budget models, like this one, will be monthly. Many models are annual, such as 
the DCF model built in Chapter 11. Some are modeled weekly and many, such as 
cash flow models, are calculated on a daily basis.
In the following sections, you set up the model template with a variable time 
series so that the model will be reusable in the future. You also set up the titles, 
which also calculate dynamically as time goes by.
Making a reusable budget model template
When building the time series for this model, you can easily type in Jan-19, 
Feb-19, and so on into the Calculations tab, but by doing this, the model can be 
used only once in its current form. If you want to use it again, the following year, 
you’d need to update each and every date manually.

CHAPTER 12  Budgeting for Capital Expenditure and Depreciation      259
A much better idea is to enter the start date as an assumption, using a named 
range, and each time you use it in the model, refer to the named range. For more 
information about creating, using, and deleting named ranges, see Chapter 6.
Follow these steps to set up the time series for the budget template:
1.	 Select the Assumptions tab and select cell B2, which contains the budget 
model start date.
2.	 Type Start in the name box in the upper-left corner, as shown in 
Figure 12-1.
Now you can use this named range in your formulas as a starting point to 
model the time series.
3.	 Select the Calculations tab and in cell H2, type =Start.
The value Jan-19 appears. Note that the day of the month does not show 
because of the way cell H2 has been formatted.
4.	 In the Font section on the Home tab, change the font color to white, as 
shown in Figure 12-2.
In cell I2, you now need to add the rest of the dates. Instead of typing it in 
manually, you should link it to the start date now in cell H2. There are 31 days 
in January, so the formula =H2+31 would do the trick but copying it across 
would make your dates slightly inaccurate and cause problems later on. 
Instead, you can use an EDATE function.
FIGURE 12-1: 
Creating a named 
range for the 
budget model 
start date.

260      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
5.	 Select cell I2, and enter the formula =EDATE(H2,1).
By entering the 1 in the second part of the formula, you’re given a date that  
is exactly one calendar month from the start date (H2). The value in cell I2  
is Feb-19.
6.	 Copy cell I2 all the way across the row to S2, so that you have all months 
entered from Jan to Dec.
Just for fun, go back to the Start date assumption on the Assumptions page, 
and enter the formula =TODAY(). It will show the month and year of today’s 
date. Go back to the Calculations page, and you’ll see that the budget starts 
from this month and runs for 12 months into the future. Use the Ctrl+Z 
shortcut to undo and change the start date back to Jan-19.
While you’re here, you should also add in the dates for the depreciation 
calculations from column Y onward.
7.	 Select cell Y2.
Now, you could simply link this cell back to cell H2, but that would be a case of 
spaghetti links (see Chapter 14). It will work, but it’s not good modeling 
practice.
8.	 Copy all the cells in the range H2 to S2 across to Y2 to AJ2.
This will link back to the source. Now you’re ready to build the budget.
FIGURE 12-2: 
Changing the  
font color.

CHAPTER 12  Budgeting for Capital Expenditure and Depreciation      261
Creating dynamic titles
Before you get into the modeling, take a moment to update the titles in red. It’ll 
be helpful to show the year in the title, but you don’t want to hard-code the year, 
because that means the template can’t be reused. Instead, use the YEAR() formula 
coupled with the ampersand (&) to make a dynamic title:
1.	 Select cell A1 and edit the formula to =“CAPEX BUDGET “&YEAR(Start).
2.	 Change the font to black if necessary.
3.	 Select cell A11, and enter the formula =“Budgeted Spend “&YEAR(Start).
These two formulas in cell A1 and A11 will pull out the year of the start date only, 
and will automatically change when the start date changes. For another example 
of using the ampersand in dynamic text, see the example of linked dynamic text 
in Figure 4-4 (see Chapter 4).
Output 1: Calculating Cash Required for 
Budgeted Asset Purchases
Now that you’ve set up the layout of the model, you can start to model the num-
bers. The Calculations page contains all the information you need to create a cash 
flow schedule and calculate the depreciation. The top section you’d obtained from 
the fixed assets register, and the second part is the budget for the coming year.
The first thing you need to do is calculate the total line item amounts in column 
E. Follow these steps:
1.	 Select cell E4 and enter the formula =D4*C4.
2.	 Copy the formula down the column to row 24.
3.	 Select cell E25 and press Ctrl+=.
This inserts a total.
4.	 Check your totals against those in Figure 12-3.
Now, you can use the dates to populate the cash flow schedule. Don’t worry 
about the prior period for now — just focus on comparing the dates in the time 
series to the spend date in order to populate the cash flow schedule.

262      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
5.	In cell H4, enter =IF($F4=H$2,$E4,0).
The calculated value in cell H4 is zero because the spend in row 4 occurred in 
the prior year, not Jan-19.
Be sure to use your mixed cell referencing (using the dollar signs) correctly. For 
a refresher, see Chapter 6.
6.	Copy this formula all the way across and down the block of data.
By doing this, you’re following good modeling practice by having consistent 
formulas in blocks of data wherever you can.
7.	Compare your totals to Figure 12-4.
If the referencing has been done correctly, most of the values should be zero, 
with a few values showing.
You’ll notice that no values are showing for the prior period in column G. You 
need to add a different formula here, which shows the spend value only if the 
spend occurred prior to the start date of the model. Again, refer to the named 
range you created earlier because the start date is an arbitrary value that will 
change.
8.	Select cell G4 and enter =IF(F4<=Start,E4,0).
The calculated value in cell G4 is $5,250.
9.	Copy the total in cell E25 across the range G25 to S25.
10.	Compare your totals to Figure 12-4.
FIGURE 12-3: 
Calculating  
total CapEx.

CHAPTER 12  Budgeting for Capital Expenditure and Depreciation      263
Take a moment to understand what this sheet is now telling you. You’ve taken the 
total spend for each item in column E and spread it out over the full year. The 
totals of each of the columns G through S should be equal to the total of column 
E. If they aren’t, you need to figure out why.
A good financial modeler is always looking for opportunities to include error 
checks in her financial model. Here’s a good example of where you can include 
one. For more information about error checks, see Chapter 4.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Select cell E26 and enter the formula =E25-SUM(G25:S25).
The calculated value will be zero because the totals are identical.
2.	 If you want, use conditional formatting to color the entire cell red if the 
error check has been triggered.
If you choose to do this, select Conditional Formatting on the Home tab of the 
Ribbon, click Highlight Cells Rules, select More Rules, and create a new rule 
under Format Only Cells That Do Not Contain a Zero. Change the formatting  
to red fill.
Now let’s test the error check to see if it works.
3.	 Select cell F12 and change the value to Oct-20 instead of Oct-19.
The error check in cell E26 is triggered because that date is outside the range 
of the budget schedule and is not being picked up.
FIGURE 12-4: 
The completed 
cash flow 
schedule.

264      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
4.	 Select cell F12 again, and type in 10/15/19 (or 15/10/19, depending on your 
regional settings) to enter Oct 15, 2019.
Even though the date is within the budget schedule range, the cost in row 12 
still isn’t being picked up! This is because the dates in row 2 are actually the first 
of each month (even though it has been formatted to show only the month and 
the year) so it won’t pick up 15th of the month because the formula is only 
looking for the 1st. This kind of error is really easy to make, and it’s a good 
example of how an error check can identify an error that’s been made by a 
user after the model is complete.
Now that you’ve identified this error, you need to correct it and ensure that the 
same mistake doesn’t happen again going forward. There are a couple of different 
ways of handling this:
»
» You can manually change October 15 to October 1. This method is not 
recommended because, although it’ll correct the error in this instance, it won’t 
stop any users from making the same mistake again.
»
» You can insert an extra column to the right of column F, and convert 
each date that has been entered to the first of the month using a 
formula such as =EOMONTH(F4,-1)+1. This method will work, but you’ll 
need to make it clear to the user that any date that is entered will be con-
verted to the 1st; otherwise, users will be under the mistaken impression that 
any date that is entered will have the exact number of days for the deprecia-
tion calculations.
»
» You can stop the user from entering incorrect data in the first place.
My preferred solution for this problem is to stop the user from entering an incor-
rect value in the first place, using data validations. Follow these steps:
1.	 Select the range F4 to F24 and then select Data Validation from the Data 
Tools section of the Data tab.
The Data Validation dialog box appears.
2.	 On the Settings tab, change the validation criteria to allow a list and use 
the mouse to select the range =$H$2:$S$2, as shown in Figure 12-5.
3.	 Click OK.
Data Validations are used for a number of different purposes in financial model-
ing. In this instance, they’re used to restrict entry and avoid user error. They’re 
also widely used in scenario analysis. For an example of how to do this, turn to 
Chapter 8.

CHAPTER 12  Budgeting for Capital Expenditure and Depreciation      265
After you’ve added the data validation, you need to document what you’ve done to 
show users that they can’t simply enter any old data. If they try to enter an invalid 
date, they’ll get a confusing and frustrating error message unless you explain why.
To prevent user frustration, you can add an input message to the cell so that users 
know what sort of data they can enter. This will also serve to document this model. 
For more information on using data validation input messages to document 
assumptions, turn to Chapter 4.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Select the range F4 to F24 and then select Data Validation from the Data 
Tools section of the Data tab.
The Data Validation dialog box appears.
2.	 Select the Input Message tab, enter some instructions such as those 
shown in Figure 12-6, and click OK.
3.	 Click one of the cells.
The drop-down box, as well as the input message, appears.
4.	 Try entering an invalid date, such as October 15, or any gobbledygook.
You get an error message.
You can customize this error message on the third tab of the dialog box if  
you want.
FIGURE 12-5: 
Restricting errors 
with a data 
validation 
drop-down box.

266      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
This means that users cannot enter dates in past periods — which they should not 
be doing anyway. If you wanted to allow that functionality, you’d need to enter a 
list of allowable dates elsewhere in the model and link the drop-down boxes to 
that data instead.
Because this data validation drop-down box is dynamic, the options that appear 
will change if the dates change. Try this out by changing the start date of the bud-
get on the Assumptions from January 19 to January 20. Go back to the drop-down 
boxes in column F of the Calculations page, and you’ll see that the options avail-
able change from dates in 2019 to 2020. When you build the model in this way, 
making changes in the future is straightforward.
Output 2: Calculating Budgeted 
Depreciation
Now that the spend has been spread out over the year for the cash flow, you can 
turn your attention to calculating depreciation. In order to do this, you need a few 
pieces of information:
»
» The useful life of the asset
»
» The written-down date
»
» The number of months that have elapsed since purchase
FIGURE 12-6: 
Using a data 
validation input 
message to 
document the 
model.

CHAPTER 12  Budgeting for Capital Expenditure and Depreciation      267
Useful life
The useful life can be worked out from the class of the asset, which has already 
been entered on the Assumptions page. You need to refer to the table using a 
VLOOKUP function. To review how to use this function, refer to Chapter 7.
Follow these steps to calculate the useful life:
1.	 Select the Assumptions page and select the entire range of asset classes 
and their useful life.
2.	 Highlight the range A4 through B12 and create a named range such as 
AssetLife, as shown in Figure 12-7.
3.	 Return to the Calculations page and, in cell U4, enter the formula 
=VLOOKUP(A4,AssetLife,2,0).
The calculated value is 6. This is the number of years the asset will last, but you 
need to show it in months for your depreciation calculation.
4.	 Add *12 to the end of the formula in cell U4 to convert the number of 
years into months.
The entire formula is now =VLOOKUP(A4,AssetLife,2,0)*12, and the calculated 
value is 72.
FIGURE 12-7: 
Creating a named 
range on the 
Assumptions 
page.

268      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
Getting units of time mixed up in a situation like this is very easy. Be sure to 
label carefully. On the Assumptions page, the useful life is shown as Years in 
the label in cell B4 and on the Assumptions page in cell U2 the label is clearly 
labeled to show that the time period has been converted to months.
5.	 Copy the formula down the column of data.
An #N/A error appears in cell U11. This happens because of the title in cell A11. 
You have two options here:
•	 You can clear the cell so that it’s blank.
•	 You can add an IFERROR function around the formula and copy it down 
again. If you choose this option, the formula in cell U4 will be =IFERROR(VL
OOKUP(A4,AssetLife,2,0)*12,0). Then copy it down the range.
Written-down date
Now you know when the asset was purchased (or is supposed to be purchased) and 
you also know how long the asset is expected to last. With these two pieces of infor-
mation, you can go ahead and calculate the date at which the asset is expected to be 
fully depreciated. You can use the EDATE function again just as we did earlier in 
this chapter to calculate the exact date at which the asset will be fully depreciated.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Select cell V4 and enter the formula =EDATE(F4,U4).
The calculated value is Feb-24.
2.	 Copy the formula down the range.
Cell V11 returns an incorrect value of Jan-00 again because there is no date 
value in cell F11 because of the title row. Your options are to:
•	 Clear the cell so that it’s blank.
•	 Add an IF statement around the formula that will not calculate the 
written-down date if no date value has been entered in column F. If you 
choose this option, the formula in cell V4 is =IF(F4=0,””,EDATE(F4,U4)). Then 
copy it down the range.
Note that a zero in the first “value if true” field will not work in this instance 
because a zero result in this formula will simply show as Jan-00. Therefore,  
a “” is necessary because that will show as a blank value. Be careful, however, 
when using this technique — a “” value is often treated as text by Excel and can 
cause some problems in calculations.

CHAPTER 12  Budgeting for Capital Expenditure and Depreciation      269
The depreciation schedule for  
the current year
Leave the Months Elapsed Since Purchase and Depn in Prior Period calculations 
aside for now, and start scheduling out the depreciation from column Y onward. 
What you need to do here is to show the depreciation only if the schedule date is 
between the spend date and the written-down date. Or in other words, only if the 
schedule date is greater than the spend date and less than the written-down date.
This formula is going to be more complex than what we have done so far, as it will 
contain a nested IF statement. Start by building the first part of the formula; show 
the depreciation only if the schedule is greater than the spend date. Follow these 
steps:
1.	 Select cell Y4 and enter the formula =IF(Y$2>$F4,$E4/$U4,0).
You can either type the formula directly into the cell or use the Function 
Arguments dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-8. The calculated value will be $73.
Notice that columns B, C, and D are missing from Figure 12-8. This is because 
Freeze Panes has been added to this document already. Be careful when using 
sheets with Freeze Panes added — it’s very easy to miss cells in a range when 
they aren’t showing on the sheet.
FIGURE 12-8: 
Using the 
Function 
Arguments 
dialog box to 
build an IF 
statement.

270      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
This formula takes the cost of the item and divides it by the useful life to 
calculate the depreciation — but only if the asset has already been purchased. 
Take special care with the referencing. Be sure to put the dollar signs before 
the row or the column you want to fix so that we can then copy the exact same 
formula all the way down and across the block of data.
2.	 Copy the formula across the range Y4:AJ24, and sense-check to make sure 
that it looks correct.
The depreciation should show only after the spend date has already elapsed 
on the schedule.
Again, row 11 is causing problems, but you can deal with this later, after you’ve 
finished this formula.
Now it’s time to add in the written-down date, which is the second part of the 
formula, so it should show only if the spend date has elapsed and the written-
down date has not elapsed.
3.	 Go back to cell Y4 and edit the formula to =IF(AND(Y$2>$F4,Y$2<$V4), 
$E4/$U4,0).
The calculated value is still $73.
4.	 Ensure that the mixed referencing is correct by inserting the dollar signs 
in the correct places in the formula, and copy the formula across and 
down the block of data in the range Y4:AJ24.
Again, you can remove the #N/A errors in row 11 by clearing them or adding 
the IFERROR function around the formula.
5.	 To add the IFERROR function around the formula, in cell Y4 enter =IFERRO
R(IF(AND(Y$2>$F4,Y$2<$V4),$E4/$U4,0),0).
6.	 Copy this formula across and down the block of data in the range Y4:AJ24.
7.	 Select cell Y25 and add a total by pressing Ctrl+=.
8.	 Copy this formula across the row to column AJ and compare your totals 
to those in Figure 12-9.
Take a moment to sense-check this depreciation schedule. The first line of defense 
against error is to check as you go. After you’ve finished the block of data, do a 
spot check on a random cell such as cell Z14. Select the cells and press F2. This will 
show you exactly which cells are being used in the formula because they’ll be 
highlighted, as shown in Figure 12-9. Take a look at cell AA10. Why is it returning 
a zero value when the cell next to it has a value of $13? This is because the asset 
has reached the end of its useful life and, therefore, no depreciation should be 
calculated from March onward.

Depreciation in prior periods
Now that you’ve calculated the depreciation amounts for the budget year, you can 
turn your attention to prior years. You need to do this for your Balance Sheet 
because you need to show the assets at their original purchase price, and then 
deduct the depreciation to arrive at the current written-down value.
First, you need to work out how many months have elapsed since asset purchase at 
the beginning of the budget year so that you can figure out how much depreciation 
to carry forward. You can do this by deducting the budget start date (January 1,  
2019) from the asset’s date of purchase (February 1, 2018, for the first asset). The 
formula =Start-F4 in cell W4 will return the value 334, which is the number of days 
between the two dates. To convert this number of days to months, you need to 
divide it by, say, 30 with the formula =(Start-F4)/30. This is probably close enough 
for our purposes in this model, but it would be more accurate to use a function 
such as DATEDIF, which calculates the exact number of calendar months between 
the two dates.
Follow these steps to calculate the amount of time that has elapsed since the asset 
was purchased:
1.	 Select cell W4 and enter the formula =DATEDIF(F4,Start,”m”).
The first field contains the beginning date, the second field contains the ending 
date of the period, and the third field contains the unit of measurement in 
which to show the resulting value. “d” denotes day, “m” denotes month, and  
“y” denotes year.
FIGURE 12-9:

depreciation.

272      PART 3  Building Your Financial Model
2.	 Copy this formula down the range W4:W10.
Note that this formula is only relevant for assets purchased in the past, so the 
bottom half of the schedule can be left blank.
The DATEIF function, although first introduced in Excel 2010, is strangely not 
found in the Function Arguments dialog box. To use the function, you need to 
type it manually into the cell. It’s rather a mystery why this function did not 
make it into the Function Arguments dialog box, but it’s a rather handy secret 
to know!
You can now calculate the depreciation for prior years in column X by dividing 
the original purchase amount by the useful life to arrive at the monthly 
depreciation amount. This amount is then multiplied by the number of elapsed 
months to work out how much depreciation has been incurred in prior years.
3.	 Select cell X4 and enter the formula =(G4/U4)*W4.
4.	 Copy this formula down the range X4:X10.
Again, note that this formula is only relevant for assets purchased in the past, 
so the bottom half of the schedule can be left blank.
5.	 Copy the sum formula across from cell Y25 to cell X25 to calculate the 
total for the prior period.
6.	 Compare the totals to those in Figure 12-10.
FIGURE 12-10: 
Depreciation in a 
prior period.

Output 3: Calculating the Written-Down 
Value of Assets for the Balance Sheet
For the balance sheet, you need to know how much the asset was originally pur-
chased for, and how much has been depreciated to arrive at the written-down 
value. You already have all the pieces of information that you need to calculate 
this, and a place to enter it in row 27 of this model. Note that these assets will be 
called property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) on the balance sheet. For more 
information on how to incorporate these calculations in a full working financial 
model, see Chapter 10.
Follow these steps:
1.	 In cell G27, enter =G25+F27 to calculate the total cost of the assets.
This row is a cumulative total that will keep adding more assets as they’re 
purchased. Note that although there is no value in cell F27, for the sake of 
formula consistency, you’re still including it so that the formula can be copied 
across the range consistently.
2.	 Copy this formula across the row to column S and compare your figures 
to those in Figure 12-11.
3.	 In cell G28, enter =-X25+F28.
Again, you include cell F28 for consistency, even though it does not contain a 
value. The calculated value is –$7,708.
4.	 Copy this formula across the row to column S and compare your figures 
to those in Figure 12-11.
5.	 Add these cells together in cell G29 with the formula =SUM(G27:G28).
The calculated value is $60,242
6.	 Copy this formula across the row to column S and compare your figures 
to those in Figure 12-11.
Now that you’ve completed this model, it can be used as a stand-alone model, or 
each of the completed outputs can be used as inputs for an integrated financial 
statements model.

Ten Strategies for 
Reducing Error
I
f you aren’t absolutely paranoid about making a mistake in your financial 
model, you should be! Even people with a little experience using Microsoft Excel 
know how easy it is to get something wrong. Both formula and logic errors are 
easy to make — and they’re prevalent in corporate financial models. As a financial 
modeler, you have to be vigilant about errors as you build the model. In this 
chapter, I offer up ten strategies you can employ to reduce errors when building 
your financial models.
Using the Enter Key
The most common errors in financial models are silly formula mistakes — for 
example, picking up the wrong cell or missing a dollar sign in the cell referencing. 
Because these mistakes are the easiest ones to make, they’re also the easiest to 
avoid.
After entering a formula in a cell, press the Enter key. Don’t just click somewhere else.
Chapter 13

278      PART 4  The Part of Tens
There are two reasons not to click somewhere else after entering a formula.
»
» You may accidentally pick up an incorrect cell, which then autocorrects 
to a completely incorrect formula, as shown in Figure 13-1.
»
» More important, when you click somewhere else after entering a 
formula, you’re not checking what you just entered. You need to be 
deliberate about what you’ve just done — don’t just quickly move on to the 
next task. When you finish entering a formula, look at the result. Does it look 
right? Is the number what you expected?
Pressing the Enter key is your number-one line of defense against errors.
Checking Your Work
A lot of modeling is trial and error. Making mistakes is okay — you just want to 
make sure you find your mistakes before someone else does! Silly formula mis-
takes are the easiest ones to make — and the most embarrassing. Fortunately, by 
employing good error-checking techniques as you build the model, formula errors 
are the easiest ones to detect and correct.
FIGURE 13-1: 
If you click 
elsewhere after 
entering a 
formula, you may 
accidentally pick 
up a cell you 
didn’t mean to 
pick up.

CHAPTER 13  Ten Strategies for Reducing Error      279
After you finish entering a formula, and after you’ve pressed the Enter key (see 
the preceding section), pause for a moment to check the result. Even if you’re in a 
hurry. Especially if you’re in a hurry. When you have to get a report out by the end 
of the day and the formulas are flying, that’s when mistakes happen. Use a calcu-
lator or, if it’s a simple sum, highlight the range you’re adding, and check the 
total in the lower-right corner in the status bar, as shown in Figure 13-2. (The 
green triangle in the upper-left corner of cell B15 alerts you to the fact that some-
thing isn’t quite right with this formula.)
Highlighting cells and checking totals using this method is a good way of checking 
for errors. By checking your work as you build, you’re less likely to let errors slip 
through the cracks.
Checking It Again
After you’ve checked your formula and perhaps copied it down a block of calcula-
tions, check it again! Another way to check the formula visually is to press the F2 
shortcut key, which shows exactly which cells are being used in the formula (see 
Figure 13-3). This technique is most useful if the source cells are nearby and on 
the same sheet. When you’ve copied down all the cells in a block of data, do a 
spot-check with the F2 key to make sure it’s picking up the correct cells.
FIGURE 13-2: 
Checking the  
sum total in the  
status bar.

280      PART 4  The Part of Tens
Getting Someone Else to Check Your Work
Once you’ve entered the formulas, checked them, copied down the block, checked 
the totals, finished your model, and checked again, it’s time to have someone else 
look at it. I highly recommend having an agreement in place with one of your col-
leagues where you check each other’s work before it gets sent to senior manage-
ment. There’s no faster way to lose credibility than having your mistakes pointed 
out in public.
Why have someone else review your model? Because that other person will bring 
a fresh perspective. Sometimes you’ve looked at your model for so long that you 
just can’t see the glaring error right in front of you. Just explaining the model’s 
logic to someone else can also help you to see holes in the logic and ways to 
improve the methodology.
If the model is high profile or very important, you may want to get it audited by a 
model audit firm. Many organizations specialize in conducting professional model 
audits. This is really the only way to be absolutely confident that there are no 
errors and your model is working correctly.
Documenting Assumptions
A model is only as good as the accuracy of the assumptions. The phrase “garbage 
in, garbage out” has never been more relevant than in the context of financial 
FIGURE 13-3: 
Spot-check 
formulas using 
the F2 key.

CHAPTER 13  Ten Strategies for Reducing Error      281
modeling. Even the most beautifully built, best-designed model will be completely 
worthless if the input assumptions that go into it are incorrect.
Important decisions are made based on the outputs of the model, so it’s absolutely 
critical to list clearly (and sometimes in mind-numbing detail) the assumptions 
that have gone into the model.
Models are only as good as the data they contain, and the answer they produce 
should most certainly not be taken at face value. When presented with a model, 
a smart manager or decision maker will query all the assumptions and the way 
it’s built.
As a financial modeler, you must ensure that all the assumptions have been vali-
dated to the best of your ability. Document clearly where the numbers came from 
so that there can be no possible misinterpretation of the assumptions you’ve used. 
That way, the assumptions can be revisited and possibly revised at a later date.
Documenting Methodology  
with a Flowchart
When you’re explaining a complex process, such as one represented by your 
financial model, it can sometimes help to have a diagrammatic flowchart that 
explains the way that the numbers have been calculated in your model.
Excel doesn’t create a flowchart of the model very easily, although there are add-
ins that can help you do this. Without the help of add-ins, you can use SmartArt 
or simply cells and arrows to create a flowchart to document the inflows and out-
flows of your data within the model.
A flowchart isn’t always necessary, but if your model contains a large number of 
sheets and calculations and is difficult for others to follow, a flowchart can be 
helpful for checking the logic. It’s also useful in explaining the methodology of 
your model to other people.
Stress-Testing with Sensitivity Analysis
After you’ve finished the model, you can test to see if the calculations are working 
correctly by changing an input and seeing what impact that change has on the 
numbers. This technique of changing one single input in isolation is called 

282      PART 4  The Part of Tens
sensitivity analysis (as opposed to scenario analysis, which involves changing several 
variables at once; see the next section).
For example, after you’ve finished the cafe model in Chapter 12, you can test that 
the model is working correctly by changing one of the input assumptions and see-
ing what effect that change have on the output of the model. Follow these steps:
1.	 Set your model to the base case on the IS Cash Flow page.
Note that Other Costs is $29,192 and Net Income is $7,791.
2.	 Go to the Assumptions sheet and change the consumables per cup in cell 
B17 from $0.45 to $1.
3.	 Stop for a moment to think about what effect you would expect this 
change to have on your Income Statement.
4.	 Go back to the IS Cash Flow page.
You’ll notice that Other Costs has jumped to $45,804 and Net Income has 
dropped to a loss of $3,838!
You can see that the model is working correctly, because the costs are increasing, 
based on the consumables cost increase, and the profit has reduced, which is what 
you would expect. It also shows that the model is very sensitive to changes in 
input costs, which is an interesting insight.
Let’s try another one, a little more drastic this time:
1.	 Set your consumable costs back to $0.45 and make sure the model is set 
to the base case on the IS Cash Flow page.
2.	 Change the pricing for large and small cups of coffee from $4 and $3.50, 
respectively, to $0.
3.	 Think about what you would expect to happen in the model.
Revenue should be zero, right?
4.	 Go back to the IS Cash Flow page and check that that is indeed what has 
happened.
Although you don’t actually expect the consumable costs to increase to a dollar, 
and you would never charge nothing for your coffee, stress-testing using sensitiv-
ity analysis checks both that the formulas are working correctly and that the logic 
is sound.

CHAPTER 13  Ten Strategies for Reducing Error      283
When checking the logic and formula calculations with a sensitivity analysis, be 
sure to think through carefully what you expect to happen before looking at the 
effect your change has had on the outputs of your model. Beware of cognitive bias, 
where you only notice things that confirm what you already think.
See Chapter 8 for more on sensitivity analysis in financial modeling.
Conducting a Scenario Analysis
After you’ve finished all the calculations in your model, do lots and lots of sensi-
tivity and scenario analyses. Stress-testing with sensitivity analysis (see the pre-
ceding section) will check that the inner workings of the formulas and logic of the 
model are correct, but how realistic are the assumptions? If the absolute worst 
happens, what happens to your bottom line? How sensitive is your model to 
changes in key assumptions? This information will help to test the accuracy and 
robustness of your model, as well as the soundness of the business, product, or 
project the model is representing.
At a minimum, a financial model should include at least the following three 
scenarios, or at least some version of them:
»
» Best case: Set all assumptions to the highest possible value you can conceive 
as being achievable (even in your wildest dreams).
»
» Base case: Set all assumptions to what you actually think is going to happen.
Be realistic! This is not the place to be conservative in your estimates — that’s 
for the worst-case scenario.
»
» Worst case: Set all assumptions to the lowest imaginable value that you think 
might happen. If everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong, what 
does our model look like?
Additionally, financial models often include other scenarios to take into account 
possible fluctuations in inputs due to events, such as the following:
»
» Legislation: If changes in government legislation will have an effect on the 
price you can charge for your product, material supply, or additional costs 
such as labor, then change the inputs in your model to reflect this.
»
» Foreign exchange: If fluctuation in currency exchange rates will affect pricing 
or costings, change the inputs affected by foreign exchange in this scenario.

284      PART 4  The Part of Tens
»
» Competitors: If the introduction of a new competitor to your market would 
cause margin squeeze (meaning that you’re no longer able to charge the same 
amount for your product), you could include a scenario that shows a decrease 
in price.
These are just a few generic examples of model scenarios you might use. Scenarios 
can often flush out anomalies in the model. Look carefully at the results of your 
scenario analysis. Is it what you would expect to see? Compare the output results 
side by side. If you increase the inflation amount from 2 percent to 3 percent, 
do  costs increase by the same margin as if you increase it from 3 percent to 
4 percent?
Compared to formula mistakes, logic errors can be more difficult to spot. Prob-
lems with logic may involve incorrect timing, inserting the wrong inputs and 
source data assumptions, or using pretax instead of post-tax inputs, for example. 
Sometimes the mistakes can be a combination of both formula and logic errors, 
and scenario analysis is a good way of identifying if these sorts of mistakes exist 
and flushing them out.
Thorough stress-testing, along with scenario and sensitivity analyses, will pro-
vide your financial model the rigor and robustness to cope with the variety of 
fluctuations in assumptions that are possible in the real world.
See Chapter 8 for more on scenario analysis in financial modeling.
Taking Note of Excel Error Values
As irritating as they can be, I actually like seeing Excel errors in my formulas, 
because it means that something isn’t working and I can fix it. I’d much rather see 
an error value than a number that looks as though it’s correct when it’s actually 
completely wrong — that’ll only cause problems later on in the model.
Common sources of errors are parentheses that don’t match or missing fields for 
functions. Table 13-1 lists some error values you may get and how to fix them.
If you’re sure that the error doesn’t need to be fixed, you can always suppress the 
Excel errors and stop them from showing by wrapping an IFERROR function 
around the formula. For example, if you have the formula =(B1-A1)/A1, you can 
suppress a potential error by adding an IFERROR around it like this: =IFERROR((B1-
A1)/A1,0). If you do this, make sure that it doesn’t suppress an error value that you 
need to know about and correct.

CHAPTER 13  Ten Strategies for Reducing Error      285
Instead of cringing at a horrid #VALUE! error value, or suppressing it with an 
IFERROR function, take notice of it instead. Figure out what’s wrong, and get to 
the bottom of it. An Excel error value is far more helpful than the alternative, 
which is to have deceivingly innocent number values that are, in fact, incorrect.
If you see ###### (known as railroad tracks) in a cell, you may think there’s an 
error. Good news! This isn’t really an error at all. It just means the result is too 
long to fit in the cell. Just make the column wider, and — voilà! — the railroad 
tracks disappear.
Including Error Checks
A good financial modeler is always looking for opportunities to include error 
checks in the financial model. If you know that the sum total in the CapEx sched-
ule should be equal to the sum of each individual item, add an error check to your 
calculations to check it automatically, so that the user or modeler can see at a 
glance if the formulas are calculating correctly. You can do this very simply by 
deducting one value from the other or inserting an IF function. For detailed 
instructions on how to build error checks, see Chapter 6.
Note that error checks are not a substitute for good practices such as checking and 
auditing your formulas. Error checks are most appropriate for capturing errors a 
subsequent user has made. They’re less likely to highlight a model-building error.
TABLE 13-1 
Common Error Values in Microsoft Excel
Error Value
Description
#DIV/0!
You’re trying to divide by zero. If the divisor is a cell reference, make sure that it isn’t 
empty and that it doesn’t have a formula with the resulting value of zero.
#NAME?
There’s a name in the formula that Excel doesn’t recognize. If you used a name you 
defined, check its spelling.
You can avoid this error by using the F3 shortcut or selecting a name in the Name Box 
instead of typing it in.
#REF!
Your formula refers to a cell that no longer exists, due to a change in the worksheet. 
This happens if you deleted cells referred to in the formula or pasted cells onto cells 
referred to in the formula. You need to rebuild the formula.
#VALUE!
The function you’re using is expecting a numerical value, and you’ve entered text, or vice 
versa. You can avoid this error by using the Function Arguments dialog box.
Circular Reference
You’re trying to link a formula to itself somehow. You see Circular followed by a cell 
reference in the area below the worksheet. Trace back the logic of the formula to 
correct the error. See Chapter 5 for more information on how to do this.

Ten Common Pitfalls 
to Avoid
T
hroughout my career as a financial modeler, I’ve seen countless things go 
horribly awry. Many of these problems can be attributed to at least one (or 
sometimes several) of the pitfalls I describe in this chapter. Why focus on 
the negative? So you can learn from the mistakes of those who’ve come before 
you! If you’re aware of these potential problems, you can work to avoid them.
The Numbers Don’t Add Up
“So, are we confident in these numbers?” Often, that’s the first question you’ll be 
asked when presenting a model or drawing conclusions from one. You need to be 
absolutely sure of any numbers you’re presenting, and you need to be able to 
explain exactly how you came up with the results.
Confidence in the numbers comes from an intimate understanding of the process 
and calculations that make up the model. The audience or those you’re working 
with will be able to detect any uncertainty on your part. Read through the strate-
gies to reduce errors in Chapter 13. You can employ these strategies when building 
your model. And if you’re inheriting someone else’s model, error checking is even 
more important so you’re completely confident that the numbers are right.
Chapter 14

288      PART 4  The Part of Tens
You’re Getting #REF! Errors
#REF! errors are the worst kind of errors to get because it means that the cell(s) 
the formula is referring to have been deleted or that the formula is referencing off 
the sheet. These errors are the most difficult to fix because the offending cell is no 
longer there, so the entire formula needs to be rebuilt. To fix this type of error, you 
need to go back to the beginning, assess what the formula was trying to do, and 
rebuild it from the ground up.
You may be tempted to wrap an IFERROR function around the formula to suppress 
any error from showing at all. If you do this, you can end up masking errors that 
need to be corrected.
The best way to avoid having errors in your model is to never let anyone else touch 
it. In a corporate team environment, of course, this isn’t practical; in fact, it 
defeats the purpose of building a financial model in the first place. You can pre-
vent Excel errors from appearing in your model when others use it by restricting 
the model’s use with data validation and protection. For more information on how 
to do this, turn to Chapter 6.
If errors do appear, they aren’t anything to stress about but the worst thing you 
can do is ignore or suppress them. You need to understand why they appeared, get 
to the bottom of the problem, and fix it.
You Have Circular References
Circular references are the result of a formula that somehow links back to itself. 
Contrary to what some modelers claim, you should not allow a circular reference 
in your model. If you’re building a model, the best way to avoid circular references 
is to simply undo what you just did as soon as the circular reference warning 
appears. If you’ve inherited a file that contains circular references (or if you didn’t 
solve the problem in your own file when the problem first appeared), you can end 
up spending a lot of time trying to get them sorted out.
The most common circular reference is when you accidentally include a cell’s 
reference in its own formula. For example, in Figure  14-1, I’ve built the 
formula =SUM(B3:B8) in cell B8. An error message appears immediately. If I ignore 
the error message by clicking OK, the formula simply won’t calculate correctly. 
Although this might seem really obvious, it’s surprising how easily these kinds of 
circular reference errors can be made.

CHAPTER 14  Ten Common Pitfalls to Avoid      289
Take a look at a more complex example. In Figure 14-2, I have the opening and 
closing balance of a cash flow. In row 5, I’d like to calculate the interest income. 
Because I don’t know the exact timing of when the cash was paid or received dur-
ing the month, it’s most accurate to calculate the interest income based on the 
average of the opening and closing balance. So, the formula in cell B5 
is =AVERAGE(B2,B6)*$J$1. However, one of the inputs to cell B6 is cell B5. And 
one of the inputs to cell B5 is B6. And so it goes, culminating in a circular 
reference.
FIGURE 14-1: 
A circular 
reference.
FIGURE 14-2: 
A more complex 
example of a 
circular 
reference.

290      PART 4  The Part of Tens
If this circular reference error warning is ignored, the formula won’t calculate 
correctly, and the words Circular References will appear on the status bar at the 
lower-left side of the screen. You need to find and remove the circular reference 
from your models.
To locate circular references in a model, click the Formula tab on the Ribbon, and 
find the Formula Auditing section. Then, from the Error Checking drop-down box, 
select Circular References.
Note that one solution to the problem shown in Figure 14-2 would be to get around 
it mathematically by inserting a “working cash at end” calculation, as shown in 
row 5 of Figure 14-3. You can then use this number to calculate the interest pay-
able or receivable, and then add or deduct the interest to arrive at the ending cash 
balance in row 7. You can download the worked solutions to the example in File 
1401.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/financialmodelinginexcelfd.
If your model contains a circular reference, you can’t trust the calculations. You 
need to find and remove the circular reference from your model.
The Model Has Too Much Detail
Attention to detail is an important attribute for a successful financial modeler to 
have. In fact, many modelers are detail-oriented people because big-picture 
thinkers seldom have the patience for the intricacies and technical minutiae 
FIGURE 14-3: 
The solution.

CHAPTER 14  Ten Common Pitfalls to Avoid      291
required for complex financial modeling. However, it’s easy to lose yourself in the 
detail and get completely bogged down by it.
When you’re building a model, you need to maintain a sense of perspective and 
remember that a financial model is only a representation of reality — it’s not actual 
reality.
Putting too much detail in a model — for example, calculating the exact number 
of customers without rounding to the nearest whole number or nearest hundred — 
creates a false impression that you know more than you really do. The model is 
just an estimate of what you think might happen. There’s only one outcome you 
can be sure of: Whatever the output of the model, you can be sure it won’t be 
exactly correct.
Think about the level of detail that’s required by the users of the model. Some-
times you may need to go down to unit cost level in order to calculate revenue, but 
if no one will need or use these assumptions, then unless you need it for calcula-
tion, you don’t need to put them in. A model that provides more detail than is 
required or needed can be counterproductive.
Information is powerful, and a detailed approach allows you to draw on this 
power. Just be careful that you aren’t giving yourself extra and unnecessary work, 
or confusing, overloading, or misleading the model users.
The File Size Is Out of Control
When you start getting a fair amount of data in your financial model, it’s pretty 
easy to end up with an enormous Excel file that takes a long time to calculate, 
making it difficult to review or share with others.
If the large file size is due to a large number of rows (say, more than 100,000), 
consider using Power Pivot to store the data instead. (Turn to Chapter 2 for more 
on this tool.)
If you find your model getting out of control (and you’re using standard Excel, 
without the help of Power Pivot or any other add-ins), here are a few tried-and- 
tested tips you can use to keep that file size down:
»
» Remove any unnecessary formatting. Colors and formatting should only 
apply to the necessary range, not an entire row or column. Avoid manual 
formatting and use Styles instead.

292      PART 4  The Part of Tens
When you’re clearing cells that you’re no longer using, you probably do so by 
selecting the cell and pressing the Delete key. This action clears the contents 
and formulas, but it doesn’t clear the formatting. If you suspect this is a 
problem, you can press Ctrl+A to select all cells; then on the Home tab of the 
Ribbon, in the Editing section, click the Clear drop-down and select Clear 
Formats.
»
» Make sure formulas are referencing only the range they need to (not 
selecting the entire row or column). If your formulas are referencing more 
cells than they need to, this will use more memory. For example, use the 
formula =SUM(A1:A1000) to allow for additional rows instead of =SUM(A:A). 
Alternatively, you can format the data as a table and refer to the automatically 
expanding table ranges in your formula instead.
»
» Remove (or at least check the size of) any logos or images that you’re 
using. A single JPG file inserted in a model can easily add 10MB to an Excel 
file size.
»
» Avoid PivotTables. PivotTables really chew up memory. If you have multiple 
PivotTables, make sure they’re using the same data source, and not creating a 
whole new one.
»
» Remove external links to other files. To check if there are any external links 
in your model, go to the Data tab on the Ribbon and click Edit Links in the 
Connections section. If the Edit Links button is grayed out, that means there 
are no external links. If they exist, click the button and when the Edit Link 
dialog box appears, click Break Links to paste the data from all external links 
as values, and the external links will be removed. If you absolutely have to use 
external links, have the source file open at the same time; this will speed 
things up.
»
» Check for redundancies in inputs and calculations. Sometimes a model 
evolves, and there may be parts that are no longer used or parts where 
information has changed. See Chapter 5 for techniques on how to check for 
redundancies.
»
» Avoid volatile functions. Some of the most commonly-used volatile func-
tions are OFFSET, INDIRECT, RAND, NOW, TODAY, ROW, and COLUMN. 
Overuse of these particular functions in your model can really slow down your 
calculations. If you must use them, try to limit their appearance in the model. 
For example, =TODAY() is very useful for giving today’s date, but instead of 
using it multiple times in a formula, have it in one single cell and continually 
reference back to that one cell for today’s date.
»
» Make sure you aren’t using the XLS file type. XLSX is a much more compact 
file type, and you’ll see a huge difference in speed and file size if you use 
it. XLSB is an Excel binary workbook file type that is even more compact 
than XLSX.

CHAPTER 14  Ten Common Pitfalls to Avoid      293
If you’ve tried all these tips and you’re still having problems, consider switching 
the calculation to manual (you can do this by clicking the Formulas tab on the 
Ribbon, going to the Calculation section, and selecting the manual calculation 
option). Then press F9 only when you need to recalculate. You’ll know if some-
thing needs to be calculated, because you’ll see Calculate in the status bar.
Finally, as a last resort, a little trick is to leave one cell at the top of the column 
with the live link and paste all the other cells as values. Copy the cell down and 
recalculate when you need to refresh. This certainly isn’t a preferred option, 
because it’s time-consuming and prone to error, but that’s why it’s a last resort.
Your Model Is Full of “Spaghetti” Links
A link that links to a link, which then, in turn, links to another link, and so on 
throughout the model is called a spaghetti link. Spaghetti links can be confusing 
and difficult to follow, and they aren’t good modeling practice. Wherever possible, 
you’re always much better off linking directly to the source.
For example, in Figure 14-4, I have a model that’s calculating student fees at a 
university. It’s laid out in a repetitive, block format, which is a good way to lay out 
a model because it’s logical and sequential. Each block leads on to the next one, 
which makes it easy to follow the calculations. You can take a look at the links 
in  this file yourself by downloading File 1401.xlsx at www.dummies.com/go/
financialmodelinginexcelfd and selecting the sheet labeled 14-4.
FIGURE 14-4: 
Spaghetti links 
in a model.

294      PART 4  The Part of Tens
At the top of each block, the dates have been laid out across the top. Linking these 
dates is a good idea, because it will make it easy to change if you want to reuse or 
update the model. However, as you can see in cell B38, I’ve linked the dates in row 
38 to those in row 29. Row 29 is linked to row 20, which in turn is linked to row 
11. Row 11 links to the top row, row 2, a perfect example of spaghetti links.
This works well, until I decide to remove a block. Later on, I decide that showing 
the average load per student separately is unnecessary, so I delete this block. This 
causes havoc in the model, meaning that any links subsequent to the second block 
become #REF! errors, because the cell they referenced has been deleted (see 
Figure 14-5).
Note that this hasn’t happened to the list of faculty names on the side. Although 
these names are also repetitive and could have easily been connected, I’ve cor-
rectly linked them to the source instead, so they aren’t affected when the second 
block is removed.
This is a very simple example of what can go wrong when using spaghetti links, 
but there are other reasons to link directly to the source. When checking or vali-
dating a model, spaghetti links make it much more time-consuming to audit the 
formula. If you’re using trace precedents (see Chapter 5), imagine how frustrating 
it is to trace back multiple layers of dependencies instead of simply jumping to the 
original source data.

errors when

are used.

CHAPTER 14  Ten Common Pitfalls to Avoid      295
The Formulas Are Unnecessarily  
Long and Complicated
Keeping formulas as simple, clear, and straightforward as possible is always good 
practice. Remember that the model isn’t only for you to use — it should be a tool 
that anyone in your team can pick up and understand with minimal explanation 
from you.
As you continue your journey as a financial modeler and learn very complicated 
and sophisticated Excel functions, you may be tempted to show off your Excel 
skills by creating fancy and complicated formulas. The problem is, this isn’t very 
clever at all. A model should be as simple as possible but as complex as necessary.
This means you should start with a simple solution, and if that does the job, great! 
If you need additional functionality, you might need to add to it — but do it in a 
separate cell or a separate calculation block.
Deciding at what point to break a formula into separate cells is tricky because it 
also can make the model bigger. But as a general rule, and depending on the com-
plexity of the functions used, don’t try to do more than two or three things in a 
single cell. Break it down into separate rows or calculation blocks and lay it out so 
that it’s easy to trace back and see exactly how the numbers have been calculated.
For example, this calculation to come up with student fees seems simple enough:
Student Numbers × Load per Student × Fees per Load Unit = Total Fees
But when converted to Excel, it’s more difficult to follow:
=B3*VLOOKUP($A12,Assumptions!$A$2:$B$7,2,0)*VLOOKUP($A12,Assumptions!$
A$1:$C$7,3,0)
Even though the formula is only multiplying three numbers together, which is not 
difficult to follow, the fact that the first two numbers are derived from a VLOOKUP 
function makes it difficult to check and understand. The formula is much easier to 
follow if the calculation is laid out in separate blocks.
As you’re building a model, take a moment to consider the user who needs to 
make sense of your formulas afterward. Anyone using this model will want to 
check the numbers for herself and make sure she follows how they’ve been calcu-
lated. A long and complicated formula may make perfect sense to you at the time, 

296      PART 4  The Part of Tens
but it needs to be as clear and easy as possible for someone else to understand — 
and for you to come back later to figure out how the formula works again if you 
need to modify it.
No One Is Paying Attention to the Model
Imagine you’ve spent weeks slaving over your financial model. It flows beautifully, 
the numbers are perfect, and the scenarios work. Finally, the time has come to 
present your pride and joy at the weekly management meeting. You hand out hard 
copies, show the results on the projector, and launch into a detailed explanation 
of what the model is telling you about the business. “That’s great,” someone says, 
smiling politely. “Thanks very much.” “What’s for lunch?” someone else asks.
This kind of disinterest from those not involved in the model-building process 
can be disheartening, but there are a few things you can do to gain their interest:
»
» Involve them in the project if you can. Ask their opinion on the subject and 
have them review the assumptions in advance of the meeting. If they’re 
involved in the inputs and if they have a stake in the outputs, it’s going to 
mean more to them.
»
» Show some visuals. A boring black-and-white table with model outputs will 
put even the most hard-core bean counter to sleep. Spend some time making 
the outputs more meaningful with some charts and visual analysis.
»
» Don’t just present an information dump, or bore them with unnecessary 
detail.
For more ideas on how to better present model output, see Chapter 9.
You Don’t Want to Let Go
If you’ve spent a lot of time on a financial model, designing it, building it, and 
making sure it works properly, handing it over to be operated by others can be 
stressful. After all, it’s your creation, your “baby,” and no one knows the workings 
of the model better than you. You’re proud of it and you know it works well, but 
you’re not sure someone else will appreciate it or take care of it the way you do.
It’s natural to be worried about letting go of your model, but don’t allow yourself 
to fall into this trap. Keeping a model to yourself is dangerous, and being 

CHAPTER 14  Ten Common Pitfalls to Avoid      297
dependent on one person — even you! — for any process is poor business prac-
tice. So, how do you share your models without putting them at risk? You need to 
teach the people who are going to be using the model how to use and maintain it 
from the start.
Instead of building your model in isolation, start building the model collaboratively. 
You’ll be the model designer, the one responsible for the building of the model, 
but you should involve your team members in the process right from the start. Ask 
for their advice. Collaborate on design and assumptions input during the decision-
making process. If you bring everyone onboard, you’ll lessen the model’s 
dependency on you, which means that other people will take ownership of it, too. 
And when they own it, they care about it.
There are some other benefits to sharing your model. Not only will it be better for 
the team, but by collaborating with your colleagues, you’ll get the benefit of a 
fresh pair of eyes and a different perspective, which is extremely valuable. Your 
colleagues may be able to suggest developments and help you to improve the 
model or identify where there are errors or opportunities for a more efficient 
process.
Put together a user guide for your model. A user guide can help make the model 
sustainable and support its use, covering times when you aren’t in the office, or 
after you’ve moved on because of the promotion you’ll inevitably receive due to 
your superior financial modeling prowess.
Instead of selfishly keeping a model to yourself, you need to make sure that others 
understand and use your model. By using your model, they’ll learn and improve 
their own modeling skills in the process. And that’s something you can be proud of.
Someone Messes Up Your Model
You’ve finished with your model and convinced yourself to hand it over to the rest 
of your team to review or use on a regular basis. Then, one day, you hear the words 
that strike fear into the heart of every model designer: “Sorry to bother you, but 
the spreadsheet isn’t working.”
You try hard not to panic, but you can’t help it: You break out in a cold sweat. You 
think to yourself, “I thoroughly checked that model and spent hours explaining 
and documenting how to use it. How did they manage to mess it up? That model 
was bullet-proof.”

298      PART 4  The Part of Tens
Despite a growing feeling of unease, you nonchalantly stroll over to your col-
league’s desk, trying to look calm. You take a look and, sure enough, there’s defi-
nitely something wrong.
Take a deep breath and start with the process of elimination. Here are some places 
to start:
»
» An audit trail of changes will allow you to quickly and effectively analyze the 
root cause of the issue: Is the problem with the data, or the model? You turn 
to the audit log on the front page, but it has been left blank. At handover, the 
users were asked to document any changes, but the last logged entry 
was your own.
»
» Of course, you kept a clean copy of the completed model at handover, with 
every change that was made, so you can compare the current copy of the model 
with the last one you had. If you get different answers from the “broken” copy 
and the “clean” copy with the same inputs, comparing the two versions will get 
you closer to the source of the problem.
»
» A review of any error checks you created when building the model will also 
identify the source of any obvious errors the users may have missed. Review 
Chapter 4 for more on error checks.
If you have multiple users, it becomes more challenging to determine who may 
have changed the model and whether it’s a manual error, an unexpected activity, 
or an underlying problem in the model design. Tracing back to find the error is a 
process that may be a quick fix, or it could be quite complicated. Check out the tips 
in Chapter 5 — the techniques for reviewing your own model and an inherited 
model are essentially the same.
After you’ve checked and corrected an error, you can figure out what caused that 
particular error to happen. This, in turn, allows you to put in place further error 
proofing within your model or support structure. If you haven’t done so already, 
make sure the model contains an audit log, a clean version, and error checks. Also, 
consider adding protection to the model and data validations for any inputs (for 
more information on how to do this, see Chapter 6). You can then decide to either 
correct the problem in the current version of the model or go back to the original 
by transferring the new data to a clean copy.

Author’s Acknowledgments
First, I must thank the many thousands of student modelers I’ve trained over the 
years both in face-to-face training courses and online. I’ve used their feedback 
and experiences to build, design, and improve the examples used in this book.
A number of people, including colleagues and industry experts, have assisted me 
with this book. Many of these people have taken the time to give me feedback and 
share their opinions on the subject. For their input and support, I am very grate-
ful: Susan Wilkin, Gail Davies, Matt Allington, John Michaloudis, Ian Bennett, 
Lance Rubin, Michael Hutchens, Justin Oh, Michael Alexander, Peter Bartholomew, 
and Johann Odou.
I’d also like to thank Tate, for his good cheer and help with graphics, and Mieke, 
for her constant supply of iced coffee as I wrote throughout our sweltering Sydney 
summer, as well as Enid for keeping me warm as I wrote during a winter visit to 
the UK.
