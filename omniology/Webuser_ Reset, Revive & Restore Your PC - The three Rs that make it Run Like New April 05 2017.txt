We pick the 10 best things you must do on the web this fortnight

Need to Know
8 5 - 18 April 2017
What happened?
Google came under fire after a Times
report revealed that advertising for
major brands and even the British
government was appearing alongside
extremist content on YouTube.
Web giants such as Google, Facebook
and Twitter have been criticised in the
past for being slow to take down hate
speech, terror recruitment material and
fake news sites, but now they’re
accused of profiting from them, too.
The Times investigation found that
publicly funded ads for everything from
military recruitment to blood donation
were appearing beside YouTube videos
promoting homophobia, white
nationalism and other extreme content,
including videos from jihadi groups.
This prompted the government to pull
all its advertising and demand that
Google’s executives explain themselves.
It wasn’t only government ads that
were affected. Ads from major brands
including the BBC and Channel 4 were
also found alongside extremist videos.
Adverts are placed automatically
by Google’s ad-exchange system,
but although the company said it has
policies to stop them appearing in pages
with offensive content, it admitted that
they don’t always work and has pledged
to review its procedures.
Not everyone was convinced by the
promise, and more major companies
joined a growing boycott of Google’s
advertising network, and YouTube
in particular, including KFC, AT&T,
Enterprise car rentals and GSK. Reports
suggest that as many as 200 advertisers
have pulled their marketing.
The boycott followed complaints from
UK politicians that Google was profiting
from online hatred. Labour MP Chuka
Umunna said YouTube was making its
money from “videos peddling hate”,
because ISIS-supporting videos were
tagged to run ads.
How will it affect you?
It’s not clear how Google and others will
address this issue. Google said it would
tighten its policies and develop yet
more tools to help advertisers target
their marketing. When called in by MPs,
however, Google, Twitter and Facebook
stressed that the sheer quantity of
content uploaded every day makes it
impossible to vet everything, and that
they don’t want to curb free speech.
The industry’s failure to find a solution
could encourage regulators to step in.
The EU is already pushing for action,
while Germany is considering fines of
up to ¤50m for firms that fail to take
down such content.
The impact of the advertising boycott
remains to be seen, and while it could
hit smaller publishers and YouTube
video creators, it’s likely that Google will
simply introduce more tools and checks
to ensure ads from its best customers
don’t land next to extremist material.
In the longer term, this issue may lead
to regulation. While cracking down
on extremist content and hate speech
may be welcome, unrelated material is
sure to be caught up in the purge, too.
What do we think?
On one hand, Google brags about its
machine learning and AI research. On
the other, it fails to recognise that it
might be best to keep ads away from
YouTube videos featuring ISIS imagery.
Google has a tough job ahead, but it
also has billions in profits and the
sharpest minds in the business. Perhaps
it’s time to set aside the ‘moonshot’
projects such as broadband-supplying
balloons and focus on fixing its
advertising networks. That said, Google
does at least use its networks to show
messages that make the case against
ISIS alongside terror-recruitment videos,
so some positive work is being done.
It’s also worth noting that the
information in the Times investigation
wasn’t hard to find. Companies that
advertise with Google or on YouTube
should look at the internet from time
to time and take some responsibility
for where their ad payments are going.
MPs are right to point out that
Google and other web companies
could be doing more to deal with
extreme content online. Hopefully
the threat to ad revenues and the
prospect of fines will encourage
them to invest more time and money
in addressing these problems.

What we think of this fortnight’s top tech news stories and rumours,
and how they affect you

Need to Know
What happened?
Britain has followed
America’s lead in banning
laptops and tablets from
cabins on direct flights
from a list of predominantly
Middle Eastern and
African nations.
Both governments cited
security reasons for the
ban, but said it wasn’t
made in response to a
specific threat, with US
officials pointing to past
attempts to take down
airliners using carry-on
items. British authorities
said they weren’t advising
against travel to the listed
countries, however.
Security experts were
quick to question the ban,
saying it made little sense.
A laptop hiding a bomb
could just as easily explode
in the hold, while a
smartphone poses much
the same threat as a tablet.
How will it affect you?
On direct flights to the UK
from Egypt, Turkey,
Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia
and Saudi Arabia, travellers
won’t be able to bring
larger electronic devices
into the cabin. The US ban
covers eight countries:
Egypt, Turkey, Jordan,
Saudi Arabia, Morocco,
Laptops and tablets
banned on flights
the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar and Kuwait.
The ban affects only
direct flights, so if you
travel from one of those
countries via another
before landing in the UK or
US, you’ll be able to use
your laptop in the cabin as
usual. The ban doesn’t
specifically name laptops
or tablets, and instead
targets electronic devices
larger than 6.3 x 9.3in or
0.6in thick. This means
most phones won’t be
affected, but e-readers
such as Kindles could be.
What do we think?
Air travellers have long
been jumping through
hoops for security reasons,
but while most of us don’t
grumble too much at
throwing away half a bottle
of Evian, dealing with a
laptop is more of challenge.
There’s good reason not to
leave electronics in hold
luggage – they’re at
greater risk of damage,
easier to steal and can be
accessed for their data.
A better solution needs to
be found, but in the
meantime perhaps you
should leave your larger
gadgets at home when
flying.
What
happened?
ISPs could be
forced to pay
compensation
automatically
when their
engineers
miss an
appointment
or a new
subscriber’s
service fails to
start on time,
under plans
from regulator Ofcom.
The watchdog is battling
against poor service,
having said that broadband
and landline customers are
currently forced to “fight
tooth and nail” to receive
the compensation they’re
owed – which means the
charges fail to discourage
bad behaviour from ISPs.
The plan is under
consultation, but if rolled
out it could cost ISPs up
to £185m annually, based
on figures stating that
one in eight broadband
installations are delayed
and engineers fail to
turn up for 250,000
appointments each year.
How will it affect you?
If approved, the plan will
mean that customers who
are left waiting for repairs
will automatically receive
credit on their bill or a cash
payment. After a fault, ISPs
would be fined £10 for
every day their service
remains offline, and £6 for
each day without service
after an agreed start date.
If an engineer fails to show
up for a scheduled
appointment or cancels
Get instant refunds
for broadband failures
with less than 24-hours’
notice, customers will be
handed £30.
The consultation on the
plans runs until June, and
Ofcom intends to publish
its decision at the end of
the year, so don’t expect to
find any credit on your bill
until 2018 at the earliest.
What do we think?
Broadband is essential for
most of us, and ISPs should
have learned by now not to
keep us waiting. Delays are
unavoidable sometimes,
but even in those cases
customers deserve some
compensation. Such a
gesture of goodwill would
calm many irritated
customers. It’s a wonder
the industry didn’t think of
the idea on its own.
Meanwhile, faced with
the prospect of being
forced to dole out cash to
unhappy customers, ISPs
have come up with their
own plans to offer
automatic compensation
through a voluntary code,
but Ofcom said their ideas
didn’t go far enough.
Finally, this watchdog is
showing its teeth.

AirSelfie
www.airselfiecamera.com
If you think selfies and drones are the
scourge of the modern world, then
you probably won’t be too enthralled
by the AirSelfie, the world’s first
‘selfie-drone’. For the rest of us,
though, it’s at least an interesting
idea, and it works surprisingly well.
Whereas most drones are pretty
unwieldy, the AirSelfie is not much
larger than the palm of your hand,
which means it slips easily into your
pocket and won’t scare anyone but
the twitchiest of birds. It features four
powerful propellers and
a 5-megapixel camera, and slots into
a phone case that makes it easy to
carry around and to whip out when
a photo or video opportunity arises.
There are currently cases available for
a button, where it will turn off
automatically.
Priced at a reasonable £220, this is
a great little gadget, whether you’re
a selfie addict or just a keen amateur
photographer, and despite the
occasional wobble it operates very
smoothly.
What happened?
Google is adding a new feature
in Google Maps that lets people
track your location in real time.
It’s inspired by a specific
problem: that organising
a meeting with a group of
friends can often be a chore,
involving games of telephone
tag and constant messages to the tune
of “Where are you?” and “What time
are you getting here?”. Google Maps’
new location-sharing feature hopes to
make this a thing of the past.
Using location data gathered via
your phone’s GPS (global positioning
system), the new feature lets you
provide your friends with real-time
tracking information, which allows them
to see your location, route and
estimated time of arrival on a Google
map. Likewise, you’ll be able to see
where they are and the direction they’re
heading in, so you don’t pass each other
without realising.
“Location sharing on Google Maps
is rolling out soon worldwide,” the
company said as part of a blog post
announcing the feature (bit.ly/
location420). “Whenever you want to
let someone know where you are, just
open the side menu or tap the blue dot
that represents where you are. Tap
‘Share location’ and then select who to
share with and how long to share”.
Google Maps lets people track your movements
You’ll only be able to share your
location via the Android and iOS apps,
but your contacts will be able to view
shared locations via the Google Maps
website, too.
The feature is very similar to the Find
My Friends function in iOS, which is an
established part of Apple’s ecosystem.
The crucial difference between the two
services is that Find My Friends does
not offer real-time tracking.
How will it affect you?
Although the new feature raises
understandable privacy concerns,
Google has assured users that they
won’t be permanently broadcasting
their location. Your location will only
be shared with contacts when you
explicitly choose to, and it automatically
ends when you reach your destination.
You can even cancel it mid-journey,
if you want.
What do we think?
Google Maps already knows exactly
where you are, for useful reasons such
as providing directions (as well as nosier
ones), so it might as well let other
people know, too. The location-sharing
feature could prove especially useful
in an emergency, and because it needs
to be activated manually, it shouldn’t
compromise your privacy inadvertently.
We think it’s a welcome addition to
the Google Maps app.
iPhone 6 and 7, Samsung Galaxy S7
Edge and Google Pixel, and each
includes a rechargeable battery that
provides up to nine minutes of flight
time in total (three minutes per flight).
Once in the air, the AirSelfie can
achieve a height of 66 feet, lifting
vertically into the sky to capture
impressive birds-eye shots of you
and your friends, or the scenery
around you. Its ultrasonic sensor helps
it to remain stable as it hovers, and
produce impressively clear and sharp
images, which are saved to the supplied
4GB microSD card.
To use the AirSelfie, you simply
remove it from its case to turn it on and
connect it to your phone via Wi-Fi. You
then control the device using its free
Android or iOS app, switching between
three flight modes and returning it to
its departure point at the touch of

Nimuno Loops
bit.ly/nimuno420 | From $13 (£10.40)
Imagine a world made of Lego, where everything can be
easily slotted together with no fuss and no mess. That
dream is now a reality, thanks to an ingenious invention
called Nimuno Loops, which is essentially Lego tape that turns any surface
into a Lego building base. Snip off some tape, stick it to your fridge, shoe, bike,
forehead or wherever, and you can attach Lego blocks instantly. Nimuno Loops
is available in six colours and various lengths – up to a mighty 96m. The project
has already far exceeded its $8,000 goal but funding remains open until 12 April.

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:
Marty P Kamden,
CMO of NordVPN
(www.nordvpn.com)
Q
How exactly do
ISPs collect our
data and how
can we stop them?
Josh Rowe, Facebook
A
Besides retaining
and selling users’
browsing history,
ISPs use specific methods
to collect data, some of
which are more intrusive
than others.
Half of Android devices not
getting security updates
Half of Android devices
weren’t updated with
Google’s security
patches over the past
year because phone
manufacturers and
operators didn’t pass them on.
Following the revelation that the
Stagefright vulnerability was
jeopardising the security of millions
of Android smartphones and tablets,
Google promised to release monthly
updates to the platform, which would
fix bugs and security holes identified
by its experts. Manufacturers and
mobile providers were supposed to
roll them out to customers, but failed
to – or issued them much later than
Google did – which meant half of
Android devices were unnecessarily
exposed to attacks.
The news comes off the back of
Deep packet inspection
This allows an ISP to scan the
packets of data a user sends
across the web, and is
generally used for user
protection, such as checking
for malware or prioritising
data. However, it can also be
used to log data including
location, name, age,
shopping records and so on.
Monitoring internet activity
to track, log and store data
This is lucrative information
and several ISPs collect and
sell this data to advertising
companies.
Tracking user location
through mobile devices
ISPs can track the location of
mobile devices throughout
the day, monitoring a user’s
whereabouts in real time.
Another requirement for data
collection comes to ISPs from
the government. Mandatory
data-retention laws force
ISPs to collect and store their
customers’ data for a period
of time. Collecting and
sharing such vast amounts of
data creates the risk of
system malfunctions or
hacking attacks, and people’s
personal information can end
up in the wrong hands.
There are still a few ways
you can protect your web
privacy and avoid personal
data collection. For example,
you should regularly delete
cookies, install antivirus and
anti-tracking software, and
avoid entering personal
passwords and credit card
information when using
open Wi-Fi networks.
Ultimately, however, the
best way to keep your
information private and
encrypted from ISPs is to
use a VPN, which encrypts
your data through a secure
tunnel to protect any
sensitive information and
hide your IP address.
A VPN connects a user
to the internet through an
alternative path to that
used by your ISP, so the
only information visible to
the ISP is that you’re
connected to a VPN server.
All other information is
encrypted by the VPN’s
security protocol.

SECURITY ALERT! | What’s been bothering us this fortnight
Security Helpdesk | Your questions answered by security specialists
Google’s Android Year in Review Report,
which revealed “more than 735 million
devices from 200+ manufacturers
received a platform security update in
2016”. Although manufacturers including
Samsung promised to issue fast-track
security updates, it’s taken three months
for some to be applied as part of the
company’s quarterly security patch.
Google has vowed to make it easier
for manufacturers and mobile networks
to roll out the update, ensuring everyone
gets security patches applied faster
than before.

Three suffers
another data breach
UK mobile operator Three
may have landed itself in hot
water again, after a data
breach resulted in some customers being
presented with the telephone histories
and personal details of other users.
When some Three users logged into
the My3 account-management portal,
they found themselves presented with
the names, addresses and phone
numbers for random strangers, as well
as complete, time-stamped records
of which numbers these people called
and texted. The company’s My3 portal
was taken offline for maintenance,
which drew anger from customers who
were left unable to top up or check
their balances. “We are aware of
a small number of customers who may
have been able to view the mobile
account details of other Three users
using My3,” the company said in
a statement. “No financial details were
viewable during this time and we are
investigating the matter.”
This incident follows an attack earlier
this year in which thieves made off
with the personal information of
133,000 Three customers.

HarperCollins
200th anniversary
200.hc.com
Book publisher HarperCollins celebrates
its 200th anniversary this year and is
using this fantastic site to tell its story.
The wealth of interesting content lets you
delve into the company’s rich past to
discover significant moments, get a feel
for 200 of its best books (from The
Hobbit to Moby Dick) and gain insights
from its authors. Images can be viewed
full-screen, and we love how it
contextualises and cross-references its
content with brief history lessons. You
can also tweet about your favourite reads,
making for a truly engaging experience.
Quorn
www.quorn.co.uk
Vegetarians are well catered for on
Quorn’s newly refreshed website. Not
only can you feast your eyes on mouth-
watering meat-free recipes, but you can
see dishes broken down by cuisine,
occasion, product type and season. The
site is packed with nutritional information
and insights into what exactly Quorn is,
and its newsletter delivers tips and
offers. But while the FAQ helpfully
explains mycoprotein and how Quorn
can be cooked and reheated, the product
pages use the same placeholder image
multiple times and it takes a lot of
clicking to see the full range of food.
FOOD
Lidl
www.lidl.co.uk
If you enjoy window shopping, then Lidl’s new website will be right up your street
because although it has lots of appetising offers on display, there’s no way to buy
online. This means you’ll have to head to your nearest branch if anything takes your
fancy. Luckily, there is a speedy store finder that also lets you check the opening
hours, and there’s more than enough to keep you occupied before you head for the
high street, including online leaflets, recipes, wine advice and details of Lidl’s ethical
stance. We’d like to see more information about each product, though – the current
descriptions are too brief, so you don’t really know what to look for in-store.

The Good Web Guide has been reviewing
websites since 2000 yet, ironically, it was
starting to look rather dated itself. Now
bolder and more accessible than before,
the Guide adopts the format of an online
lifestyle magazine, using larger images
and fonts to make a greater impact.
It’s a joy to read and we liked the way it
flags the best content in the Most Read

as Kelly Hoppen to find out their top
Instagram feeds and online picks.
We also like the competitions, frequent

Fashion magazine InStyle closed in
December and is now looking to survive
entirely online. This stylish makeover
of its website certainly sets the tone,
enticing readers with a blog-like layout
that uses snappy articles, vivid images
and personality-led videos. However,
we were disappointed by the clickbait
headlines and would like to have seen

it’s certainly easy to find content you’ll

Americans and Canadians but its
message is just as relevant to UK web
users and we found the advice to be very
sound. Its resources explain the latest
cybercrimes and what makes people
vulnerable, and include warnings against
oversharing and videos providing
security advice for email, passwords and
social media. There’s also a quiz that
everyone, regardless of age, should take

This site was launched by a former
lecturer in Yorkshire to display products
being sold in nearby towns and villages.
Although it’s currently limited to a small
number of locations, it brings local shops
together, placing them within categories
as varied as Food, Flowers and Beauty.
After viewing items and adding them to
your bag, you can pay and choose your
pick-up time, and also arrange for items
bought from multiple stores to be sent to
one shop for added convenience. It’s a
great idea, implemented well, with shop
profiles, opening times and special offers.
You can also ask questions and ‘love’
individual retailers.

New features include the ability to search

third-party apps so you can integrate
Google Maps, media players and more
into your sites. You can now add and
organise pages more easily, and
improvements have been made to the
chat help facility. It’s a straightforward,
easy-to-learn tool that still requires
no coding abilities. Bizarrely, the site

Plan for Britain
www.planforbritain.gov.uk
Shortly after this site launched, it was blighted by error messages, leading many wags
to joke that the ‘Plan for Britain’ wasn’t working. Now that it’s properly up and
running, it’s well worth visiting because it aims to outline the government’s position
on various elements of Brexit over the coming months and years. As well as keeping
you informed with key dates and details, it briefly sets out the 12 negotiating
objectives and attempts to discuss Britain’s economic and global hopes for a united
future. You can also see a timeline of what has happened so far and watch a video
of Theresa May discussing her vision for post-Brexit Britain.

The Business Desk

Aimed at businesses in the Midlands,

Desk has been spring-cleaned with a
faster, mobile-friendly design and a new
logo. It now makes much better use of
the available space, eschewing a single-
column list of stories for a tiled approach
and clearly tagging each article. A tighter
menu bar is supplemented by a
secondary list of news topics, making it
easier to get to the content you’re after.
You still have to register (for free) to read
full stories, but with more space for
articles to breathe, improved social-media
sharing and better signposting to special
reports, this is worth doing.

Send Google Docs straight to

Writing your web pages in a word
processor is a good idea, but it
can feel like an unnecessary extra
step if you’ve then got to cut and
paste your work into a WordPress
website. To make it easier, Google
Docs (docs.google.com) now has
a WordPress add-on called
WordPress.com for Google Docs.
Click the Add-ons menu and
choose ‘Get add-ons’. Search for
the add-on and install it into your
Google Docs account. You can
now work on a document and
even collaborate on it with others;
add images; and click the Save

Q
Could I save money by hosting

Marcus Spencer, via email
A
The short answer to this is yes,
but if you need a website to load
quickly, be online 24/7 and give
your visitors (and Google!) the best possible
experience, then you would need to use
a hosting company.
Your home broadband will be slow to
serve a website because your connection
to the internet is shared with others and
your upload speed will be slower than
a web host’s connection. Also, web hosts
use powerful servers that are faster at
processing a site than your home PC.
Besides, you can get top-quality hosting
packages for a few pounds a month now –
less than the price of your morning coffee!

e all know that backing up is essential and
we all make excuses not to do it. But when
disaster strikes and you lose the contents of
your hard drive, you’ll have plenty of time to regret
your carelessness and procrastination.
Cloud backup provides a stress-free solution to this
problem. Install the software and you can forget about
your backup, safe in the knowledge that it’s happening
without your input. The software runs automatically in
the background, so any changes you make to your files
are sent to your big backup in the cloud. If you ever
lose anything, all your data is just a download away.
CrashPlan is a ‘set-and-
forget’ service with
unlimited storage, so
you don’t have to clear
out old files to maximise
space or even think
about your backups at
all. It’s a persuasive
pitch that sounds too
good to be true, but
we’ve tested it and it
works extremely well.
CrashPlan was one of this Group Test’s best
performers. Our 5GB folder of personal files was
uploaded in under two hours – only Carbonite
was faster. Downloading the data again was also
fast, limited only by the speed of our fibre
connection: it took just 21 minutes – only two
minutes behind the fastest in the group.
There’s no catch to its unlimited storage, either.
The basic Individual plan that we reviewed lets
you back up from external drives and network
shares, if you have them set up in the right way.
Moreover, while CrashPlan won’t keep unlimited
versions of old files forever, the software lets you
decide how frequently updated files should be
archived,
according to their
age. For example, you
might specify that you
want to keep an hour-by-
hour history of files from
the last three
months, but
only need
a monthly
history of
files that are
more than
a year old.
If need be,
you can keep
track of file changes as often as every 15 minutes.
The service supports multiple backup sets, so
you can have specific files and folders backed up
to the cloud according to one schedule, while
a second backup job runs at a different time,
moving another set of files to a range of
destinations – elsewhere on your own PC, to
external storage or even to the hard drive of
another CrashPlan user, so your data is safely
stored in a third location for added security.
Cloud backup
We test 10 of the most popular cloud-backup
services to help you decide the best place to
store your irreplaceable data
HOW WE TESTED
While the basic formula
of cheap, unlimited
storage isn’t unique to
CrashPlan, the package is
more rounded than its
rivals. It may not be as
packed with features
as Silver Award-winning
Acronis, but if you’ve got
a substantial archive
of data, CrashPlan is
a versatile and
cost-effective way to keep
it safe. It performed well
in our tests and has plenty
of options, giving you full
control over what’s
backed up and when.

Cloud backup Group Test
5 - 18 April 2017 21
Discuss this review at forum.webuser.co.uk
Originally, Acronis offered
regular backup software but
its standard subscription now
embraces cloud backup, too,
with 50GB of online storage.
That may look mean next to
the unlimited services of the
other award winners, but if
you don’t have vast amounts
of data to secure, it’s better value for money and you can
upgrade to more storage fairly cheaply if you need to.
When you launch the software, the cloud option is
automatically selected as the default and a non-stop backup
of your personal files is initiated. You can, if you prefer, set this
to run on a schedule, such as when you log on or restart, or
when your PC is idle. It can also be used for local backups or
almost any other type of backup you can think of, which can
run simultaneously and are highly configurable. We found the
interface a bit cryptic at times: instead of labels, it uses visual
icons that occasionally needed deciphering.
Carbonite was the original
unlimited online backup
service and the basics work
as well as you’d expect from
such an established company.
Once installed, it
continuously backs up most
user files including office
documents, email archives
and music. If you don’t want it running all the time, you can
limit when it runs its backups. One unique feature of
Carbonite is its Explorer integration, which lets you right-click
any file to add it to your backup. It also marks your folders
and files with coloured blobs, so you can tell at a glance
what’s been backed up and what is still scheduled. Just be
careful this doesn’t clash with other software.
Carbonite put in a good performance in our speed tests,
beaming our 5GB of files to the cloud in the fastest time of
1 hour and 32 minutes. Files took 52 minutes to restore, which
was half an hour slower than some others we tested.

Acronis doesn’t offer the luxury of unlimited backup but if you only need to store
essential files in the cloud, its powerful software can perform various different
types of backup. The upgrade to extra storage is reasonably priced, too.
Unlike our Gold award-winner, Carbonite doesn’t let you mirror your backup
locally or save files from external drives. But it makes an easy job of getting all
the important files on your PC backed up, no matter how many you have.

BEST OF THE REST
Backblaze (www.backblaze.com | around £40.93 per year
per PC for unlimited storage | ★★★★
★★★★★) is an unlimited
backup service that’s cheaper than
CrashPlan and easy to use. However,
it doesn’t have as many advanced
options and we found it very slow at
uploading files.
The great and unique thing about
IDrive (www.idrive.com | £42.68 per year for unlimited
storage on unlimited PCs | ★★★
★★★★★)
is that it backs up an unlimited
number of devices, so it’s great value
if you have more than one PC with
important files on it. However, it was
very slow in our tests, particularly
when it came to restoring files, which took over 18 hours.
Livedrive (www.livedrive.com | £5 per month per PC for
unlimited storage | ★★★
★★★★★) is a
no-fuss option with a minimal
interface. It doesn’t penalise you for
opting for monthly payments instead
of an annual subscription, and was
reasonably fast in our tests, but it lacks the advanced
tools of the other services we tested.

Group Test Cloud backup
OUR VERDICT
CrashPlan wins our Gold Award because it provides
a fantastic all-round service at a competitive price.
It’s not the only service in this test to offer unlimited
backup but it performed well at both uploading
and downloading data, and includes plenty of
options, so you can configure your backup exactly
how you want it.
If you want to run more than one type of backup,
perhaps also storing data on an external drive, then
Silver Award-winning Acronis True Image 2017 offers
the most versatility. It isn’t as easy to use but with
years of backup experience behind it, Acronis knows
how to perform the task thoroughly and securely.
We gave our Bronze Award to Carbonite, which is
a no-fuss backup tool that doesn’t have all the bells
and whistles of its rivals, but will provide you with
a reliable backup of your data and visually show you,
using Desktop icons, which files are safe.

£89.99 from bit.ly/8hd410
Tested: Issue 410
For its low price, Amazon’s Fire HD 8 is a pleasant surprise:
it’s great for media streaming and web browsing, its battery
life is exceptional and it’s easy to use. Once it’s integrated
with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, it will be even better.

TP-Link RE450
£44.99 from bit.ly/tpl414
Tested: Issue 414
The TP-Link RE450 provides a strong signal at
a price that’s hard to resist. It’s better at extending
the 5GHz network than the 2.4GHz, but it also acts
as a bridge to transfer older devices to the newer network.

Tested: Issue 412
This good-value monitor offers impressive image quality, a
lovely design and 178-degree horizontal and vertical viewing
angles. You won’t need to calibrate it, either. If you’re after
a monitor with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, buy this.

Acer Chromebook R11
£229.99 from www.amazon.co.uk
Tested: Issue 409
The Acer Chromebook R11 laptop has a keyboard that flips
behind its touchscreen, so it can also be used as a tablet. It’s
not hugely powerful but it runs all the web apps you might
need and its battery lasted over eight hours in our tests.
KEY SPECS

Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 14
£199.98 from www.pcworld.co.uk
Tested: Issue 407
The Cloudbook 14 is as good a laptop as you’ll get for less
than £200. It’s not particularly fast and doesn’t have a
brilliant display, but it’s fantastic value, especially because
it includes a year’s subscription to Office 365 Personal.
KEY SPECS
Dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Celeron N3050 processor ■2GB of

the Forums. There’s also a Radio section
that’s supposed play songs from games,
but didn’t work for us so it’s probably

The quality of Game Jolt’s games
varies dramatically, but there are plenty
of gems to suit both hardcore and
casual gamers.
Game Jolt (gamejolt.com) offers a
growing number of free and commercial
indie games. While you would normally
visit the website to browse, launch and
download the titles on offer, this new
free client – which is based on Google
Chrome – makes it much easier to find
great games to play. The software is
currently a pre-release preview but it’s
stable and we have yet to encounter any
problems using it.
The Game Jolt Client offers easy
access to thousands of games – both
paid-for and free – and you can filter
the list by price, operating system,
maturity rating, status (‘complete/
stable’ or ‘early access)’ and more.

OnionShare uses the Tor network to share files
of any size securely and anonymously. To use
the program, you first need to install the
Tor Browser from bit.ly/tor420 and have it
running in the background.
Once that’s done, open OnionShare and drag
the file or folder you want to share to the
program window. The software will generate
a secure, cryptic URL that you can pass on to
the person you want to share with.
The recipient will need to paste the link into
the Tor browser to get the item, because it
won’t work in any other browser. It sounds
complicated but once you’ve set up OnionShare,
it’s very easy to use and is completely secure.
Copying lots of files from one location
to another – especially over a network –
can be very slow in Windows. TeraCopy
is designed to help speed up the process
and introduces a lot of handy additional
features. You can pause and restart file
copying, for example, and attempt to
resume broken file transfers.
New to the latest version is support
for an unlimited number of files (it’s no
longer reliant on how much memory you
have installed) and you can now queue
transfers for the same drive.
You can choose to install the program
or run it in portable mode.
Previously only available for Linux, the
powerful open-source video editor Kdenlive
now works on Windows. Before you can use
it, you will need to download FFmpeg (bit.ly/
ffmp420) and carefully follow the instructions
on the Kdenlive download page for adding it
to the software. FFmpeg is used for importing
and using audio and video files.
As with any video editor, Kdlenlive takes a
while to master, but it offers all the features
you’re likely to need including multi-track
video editing, timeline preview, numerous
effects and transitions, automatic backup and
a skinnable interface. It also supports all
major audio and video formats.

bit.ly/updates420
Min requirements:
Windows 7/8+/10
File size: 46KB
The imminent Creators
Update will let you delay
Windows 10 updates until
you want them but, until
then, Microsoft’s only
provision is its ‘Show or
hide updates’
troubleshooter. This has
advanced options to stop
the OS applying repairs
automatically and to
prevent the installation of
hidden updates, but there’s
no guarantee they won’t
sneak through anyway.
Four issues ago, we wrote about a short
game called Non Euclidean Room (bit
.ly/neroom416). This is the bigger, more
advanced follow-up, which uses the
same black-and-white sketch graphics
and Escher-style 3D exploration, while
introducing some very tricky puzzles.
If you like games that offer a tough
mental challenge, you’ll love this.
Windows Update Blocker
bit.ly/blocker420
Min requirements: Windows 7/8+/10
File size: 386KB
Windows 10 offers less control over system
updates than previous versions of the OS. This
helps keep your system safe, but it also means
that bad updates can be installed without your
knowledge. Windows Update Blocker lets you
disable automatic Windows updates, and has
a Protect Service Settings option that stops the
OS interfering with your preference. There’s no
need to install the program – just unzip the
download and run it. Update Blocker will mostly
appeal to to Windows 10 owners, but it also
blocks updates in older versions of Windows.

Sort Amazon products by
number of reviews
Customer reviews on Amazon are
a useful way to determine the quality
of a product, but their star ratings can
be deceptive. After all, an item with only
one review may have a five-star rating,
but won’t have been as thoroughly
tested as an item with hundreds of
reviews but a lower average rating.
A new Chrome extension called Sortem
for Amazon (bit.ly/sortem420)
addresses this problem by letting you
sort Amazon search results by the
number of reviews rather than the
average customer rating to “ensure you
get a well vetted product”. Click the
drop-down ‘Sort by’ menu in the
top-right corner of the page and select
‘Number of Reviews’ to move items
with the most reviews to the top of
the results. The add-on works with
Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.com.
Considering that Google has its own Skype rival, Hangouts,
you might question the need for an official Skype add-on
for Chrome (bit.ly/skypechrome420), especially when it
does little more than launch Skype’s web interface and let
you share sites you visit with Skype contacts. Microsoft
clearly thought so, too, because it’s now revamped the
extension with a new feature that makes it at least slightly
more useful. This integrates Skype for Chrome with several
popular online services including Gmail, Twitter, Google
Calendar and Outlook.com, so you can insert Skype call
links in messages and calendar events simply by clicking the
‘S’ button. People can then click the link to chat live to you
in a video conversation, without needing to register with
Skype – unless you’re using Linux or Chrome OS, in which
the feature doesn’t work. There’s also a Skype add-on for
Firefox (bit.ly/skypefire420) but this hasn’t yet been
updated with the call-link option.
View Chrome’s new
Extensions page
In last issue’s ‘Improve your
browser’s built-in tools’ feature,
we criticised Chrome’s extensions
manager for being “overly
simplistic”, so we’re pleased to
report that Google has taken
our concerns on board. A new
experimental feature in Chrome 57,
likely to be introduced in a future
stable release, applies Google’s
Material Design interface to the
Extensions page. Not only does
this make the manager look much
smarter, but it also makes browsing,
disabling and enabling your
extensions a lot easier. To activate
the feature, type chrome:flags
into the address bar, press Enter,
then find and enable the entry
‘Enable Material Design extensions’.
Relaunch Chrome and go to
‘More tools’, then Extensions,
to see the new look.
See who deletes you on
Facebook
When your Facebook friend count
decreases, it’s often difficult to know
who has ‘defriended’ you – unless
you’ve had a specific disagreement –
without combing your whole friend list
to deduce who’s missing. Who Deleted
Me (www.deleted.io), which is available
for Chrome and Firefox, monitors your
friend list and alerts you when someone
disappears, even revealing whether
they’ve deactivated their Facebook
account or they just don’t like you
anymore. The add-on has been around
for a while, but recently suffered a
security scare when an old Chrome
version was infected by malicious code
that injected web pages with ads.
A recent update has fixed that problem,
along with another one involving
unnecessary permissions, to provide
a safe way of spotting who’s quietly
ditched you.

Block unsafe scripts on any
website
With more than
two million users,
NoScript (noscript
.net) is one of the
most popular
Firefox add-ons and
has been protecting
web users from
dangerous scripts
and plugins for 12 years. However, times are
changing and as Mozilla abandons traditional
add-ons in favour of WebExtensions, NoScript has been updated accordingly.
NoScript 5 bridges the gap between a classic Firefox add-on and a WebExtension,
offering improved performance on data-heavy web pages and better blocking of
Google trackers, including its nosy Analytics tool. As before, you can customise
NoScript to suit your blocking needs by allowing scripts such as JavaScript on
specific sites, while forbidding them on all others, and by automatically blocking
Flash, Java and other plugins on untrusted sites. It also uses ClearClick
technology to protect you from clickjacking and lets you force sites to use their
secure HTTPS versions. Note that some Pale Moon users have reported problems
with NoScript 5 so are advised to stick with the previous version.
Scroll web pages
automatically
Ever tried to browse a web page while
both your hands are occupied? No,
we’re not implying anything rude –
perhaps you’re eating your dinner in
front of your monitor,
performing your morning
workout or playing a
musical instrument while
following on-screen
lyrics. In any case, you’re
likely to be frequently
interrupted by the need
to scroll down the page,
because websites don’t
move by themselves.
Until now, that is,
because a brilliant new
Firefox add-on called
Page Scroller (bit.ly/
scroll420) does the hard
work for you, so you can
carry on reading without
even touching your
mouse. Simply press
the ‘+’ key on your keyboard to begin
scrolling the page automatically – you
can press it four more times to increase
the speed or press the ‘-’ key to slow
Find the IP address
of any site
Concealing your
IP address from websites helps
protect your privacy but
websites can’t hide theirs from
you, thanks to the logically
named Opera add-on IP Address
Finder (bit
.ly/ip420).
Click this
add-on’s
toolbar
button and
it will tell
you your
own IP address and approximate
location. You then type in any
URL and click Get IP for details
of that site. For example, we
discovered that the IP address
for Google’s headquarters in
Mountain View, California is
216.58.219.195. Note that, as with
any IP finder, location estimates
aren’t usually very accurate, but
IP addresses are always precise.
Perform reverse
image searches
Vivaldi is adding new
features and refining existing
ones at an impressive rate,
and is rapidly catching up with
Chrome and Firefox. One of our
favourite new additions is the
option to perform a reverse-
image
search
by
right-
clicking
a picture
on a web
page
and
choosing ‘Search Google for
image’. This finds matches for
the picture on Google Images,
so you can find out more about
its subject and photographer,
and when and where it was
taken. There are also new
options to open an image in
a new tab or private window,
and to save the picture as the
background to your Start page.
OTHER BROWSERS
This fortnight’s most useful tips and add-ons to help you get the
most from Chrome, Firefox, Opera and more
down. It’s the perfect tool for busy
and lazy people alike.
Refresh specific tabs
automatically
Another new add-on that saves you
time and effort is Tab Auto Refresh
(bit.ly/refresh420), which eliminates
the need to reload pages manually
when you’re waiting for an update
to appear. Instead, you just click its
toolbar button, select a time interval
at which to refresh the current tab –
from 1 to 100,000 seconds – then get
on with something more important.
You can set multiple open tabs to
reload automatically at different
intervals, and cancel each refresh-
schedule individually or all of them
in one go. If you don’t cancel, the
reloading will resume next time
you open your browser.

App of the Fortnight
INTERNET
Meteor
meteor.opensignal.com
4.1
Using internet-hungry apps
on a slow connection is like
running a marathon on an
empty stomach. New app
Meteor tests whether your
internet is strong enough
to get the best out of apps
such as Facebook, Spotify
and Skype, and even which
room they’d work better in.
Meteor was created by
internet mapping firm
OpenSignal (opensignal
.com), which monitors
signals all over the world,
even in war zones where
relief efforts are affected
by internet availability.
Meteor’s basic test
couldn’t be easier to run. Tap once, then wait 10 seconds
or so to get the measure of whatever network you’re
connected to – either Wi-Fi or mobile data. Your results
are logged on a timeline and map, so you can trace
patterns linked to time of day as well as location.
The test consists of three measurements – upload speed,
download speed and a ‘ping test’ that sends an anonymous
signal to a nearby server. What sets Meteor apart from
other benchmarking tools is the way it puts the results in
a useful context. For example, if your download speed is
slow, you’ll notice it when waiting for photos to appear in
WhatsApp, and you may not be able to download high-
quality music in Spotify at all.
Be aware (because some
users seem disappointed)
that these app-specific
measurements are projections.
Meteor isn’t literally testing
WhatsApp’s photo-download
speed, just using it to illustrate
available speeds.
Meteor is not
groundbreaking but it’s quick,
accurate and thoughtfully
designed. It even has a cartoon
meteor called Cosmo Monster
to bring it to life,
but if you find him
as annoying as we
do, you can easily
shut him up.

“Build a website in under
a minute”, goes the bold
claim from this new app
for iPad and iPhone. It just
about lives up to the
promise, making it ideal
for creating a quick online
party invitation or
greetings card. It’ll even
throw in a domain name
for free (albeit one with a
clunky ‘onuniverse.com’
suffix bolted on the end).
Universe is much easier
to use than most PC-based
web-building tools. Start with a grid background, then add and
remove elements such as links, photos, icons and text by dragging and
dropping. In the time it takes to boil a kettle, you can create a basic
About Me page with links to your email and Facebook. With a bit more
time, you can build an interactive photo gallery or club site – just don’t
expect anything too sophisticated.

come courtesy of comic-book artist
Olivia Walch, whose new app brings
your colourful squiggles to life. You can
either adorn your photos with moving

in this new VR (virtual reality) GIF art
gallery. To view the exhibition, Loop

adventure game which entails aiming
your screen to “jump down” holes. The
GIFs are fantastic but the gamification
is pretentious and fiddly, and may put
you off before you’ve even

nothing new
– after all,

internet has made it much easier to
collate content into collections that you
can save privately or share. Shout lets
you create lists of articles, videos,

than by running around and jumping
off cliffs? That’s the premise of this
fantastic game, in which you guide a
nimble ‘dancer’ around stunning but
precarious landscapes of large
boulders, flying islands and hazardous
precipices. Unlike other running
games, falling is as important as
sprinting if you want to avoid
tumbling into the ether. Tap with two

congested city roads, collecting fares
and dodging cyclists. In this one, you
drive a coach, which means you get to
see more of the country, make fewer
stops and can ramp up the speed on
the open highways. Realistic graphics
and fluid gameplay are
complemented by simple controls,
traffic sound effects and a variety of
camera angles. But as
it’s not a British game,
you’ll have to master
driving on the wrong
side of the road.

36 5 - 18 April 2017
What is WebAssembly?
WebAssembly (webassembly.org) is
a relatively new web standard that has
the potential to revolutionise how we use
high-performance
applications such
as games, video
players and image-
editing software.
Rather than making
us download
and install these
resource-heavy
apps, WebAssembly
offers the potential
to run them in your
browser with full
functionality. Developers say this will
make computing far more convenient,
with some going as far as calling it the
dawn of a new web era.
But we already have web apps,
don’t we?
Indeed we do. Over the years, we’ve
become accustomed to running tools
in our browsers; for example, we can
word process using Google Docs, check
our emails in Gmail and edit videos
in YouTube, all without having to install
any software. But these browser apps are
typically not very sophisticated, whereas
WebAssembly opens the door to more
complex applications, all without the
need for any plugins. It also allows them
to run with near-native performance –
that is, pretty much as if they are
installed and running on your computer.
How much faster will
WebAssembly apps be?
WebAssembly significantly improves
start-up speeds, with the technology
said to run 20 times faster than
JavaScript. It is also claimed that apps
using WebAssembly run just 1.13 times
slower than your processor’s maximum
speed.
How exactly does WebAssembly
work?
We were afraid you’d ask that. To explain
WebAssembly, we first need to get under
its skin. At its heart, WebAssembly is a
low-level programming language, which
means it is effectively written in a code
near-identical to the one that computers
directly understand. When this is run,
it allows developers to take the source
code of an app written in a higher-level
computer language (one which uses
more natural syntax) and turn it into
code that a web browser can use
(a process known as compiling).
All this takes place behind the scenes,
so it won’t be obvious to you as you
browse. Both the parsing (the analysis
of the code) and the compilation take
place before they reach your browser.
This means the browser simply sees the
low-level, machine-ready instructions
and acts on them. Combined with the
compact nature of WebAssembly, this
makes the process very fast indeed.
So how do I use these apps?
All you need to do is visit a web page.

WebAssembly is being touted as the future of the web but you’d be
forgiven for wondering what on Earth it is. David Crookes explains all

SEE WEBASSEMBLY IN ACTION
5 - 18 April 2017 37
Discuss web technology at forum.webuser.co.uk
WebAssembly
You’ll be able to dive straight into playing
a game, for example, and have it run
fluidly, and you’ll also be able to move
from device to device because the
technology will be entirely portable.
Additionally, there’s nothing to stop you
launching a mobile app within your
tablet’s browser, as long as it’s capable
of using WebAssembly. Everything runs
entirely within the web platform.
So we’ll all have to use apps?
It’s possible. There are certainly plenty
of advantages to using WebAssembly.
Because you don’t need to install
software, the risk of malware infection
should be reduced. Also, apps will
become ‘cross-platform’, so it won’t
matter which operating system you are
using because they’ll simply run in any
browser that supports WebAssembly.
The standard of web-based apps should
be improved, too. We’re likely to see
more games, with virtual-reality and
augmented-reality apps using the game
engines Unity and Unreal Engine, and
have high performance, browser-based
computer-aided design and scientific
visualisation software.
Will there also be a web app
store?
No. One of the beauties of being able
to simply visit a website to access an
app is that it gets around the ‘walled
gardens’ of app stores, especially on
tablets and phones. Anyone will be able
to publish apps to the web, which will
ensure that software is accessible and
in the full control of developers.
Who is behind WebAssembly?
Development is being driven by the W3C
WebAssembly Community Group (bit.ly/
wa420), which was launched in April
2015 with the backing of the Mozilla
Foundation, Microsoft, Google and Apple.
There is a concerted and unusually
cooperative effort to make WebAssembly
a true standard, which is good news
because it means that it will eventually
find its way to all the major browsers.
Will developers
have to learn a
whole new
language?
Not necessarily,
and this is the
exciting thing.
Although Mozilla
says it could
change what it
means to be a web
developer, the idea
of WebAssembly is that coders
are able to create software in multiple
languages. Among those languages is
C++ and, given that C++ is so widely
understood by coders (it is even used
to create software as important as
Windows), many developers should feel
right at home. Indeed, developers have
been quick to see the potential and there
is hope that WebAssembly will soon be
used with Java, Swift and C# – languages
that are often used for mobile apps.
Isn’t JavaScript still the top web-
programming language?
Well, yes, but WebAssembly will allow
developers to bring their own
applications to the web and go well
beyond the capabilities served up by
JavaScript, which is indeed a high-level
programming language used to write
much of the software we already see
running in our browsers. The issue with
JavaScript is that it was designed to be
easy for novice developers, but it isn’t
ideal for starting large applications
quickly, whereas WebAssembly is.
JavaScript has also been abused by
hackers as a way to run malicious scripts.
Will WebAssembly replace
JavaScript?
It’s very unlikely at this stage, given how
widely used JavaScript remains.
Although it’s true that Mozilla,
Microsoft and Google have made
separate attempts to extend
JavaScript by releasing Asm.js,
Typescript and NACL, respectively,
WebAssembly is intended to
broaden the number of languages
that can be compiled to the web
rather than replace JavaScript
altogether. Indeed, WebAssembly
will allow its applications to integrate
with JavaScript so there will be room for
both languages for some time yet. What
will happen as WebAssembly gathers
momentum remains to be seen, though.
So which web browsers are
using WebAssembly today?
Version 57 of Chrome and version 52 of
Firefox, which are the most recent stable
releases, are both WebAssembly-enabled.
Microsoft Edge and Safari will follow
soon. There’s not a huge amount of
support around at the moment but the
creators of the game engine Unity, for
instance, have been working on switching
its WebGL platform to WebAssembly
byte code in supported browsers. WebGL
allows interactive 3D and 2D graphics to
be rendered, and WebAssembly will make
this faster and less resource-hungry.
There are already two fun ways
for you to put WebAssembly’s
abilities to the test. The first is via
Unity’s WebAssembly version of
a multiplayer sandbox game called
Tanks, which you can check out at
webassembly.org/demo, provided
you’re using Chrome 57 or Firefox
52. Boasting some lovely retro
music and attractive, fluid 3D
visuals, this lets you control one
of two tanks using your keyboard.
But for real graphical impact,
try Epic’s Zen Garden experiment
at bit.ly/zen420. This lets you look
around the exterior of a rather nice
house (see main image, left) and
brings a taste of WebAssembly’s
smooth, high-performance 3D
offerings that we can expect to enjoy
in future. It works best on 64-bit
computers because 32-bit systems
may struggle with its awesomeness.
It may have a dull website, but Unity could
bring a whole new depth to online life

COVER
FEATURE
B
ack in July 2015, in Issue 375 of
Web User (bit.ly/webuser375),
we ran a cover feature that
focused on the three essential Rs of
fixing PC problems – removal, repair
and recovery. In this follow-up, we
look at three other, equally important
Rs – resetting, restoring and
(hopefully) reviving – that comprise
a reliable triumvirate for tackling
performance problems. By following
our simple advice, you’ll soon be able
to beat the causes of slowdown and
crashes, and make your PC and
phone run like new again.
Over the following six pages, we
look at how to quickly reset your
operating system, browser and other
programs – without losing your
personal data – and explain how to
restore lost folders, files and settings.
We also explain how to overcome
more serious problems, such as
hard-drive failure, that can’t be
solved simply by resetting or
restoring, so you can revive even
the most lethargic and unresponsive
devices.

personal files). To get the tool, open
Settings, go to ‘Update & security’ and
click Recovery. Click the link under
‘More recovery options’ that says ‘Learn
how to start afresh with a clean
installation of Windows’ and download
the tool from the subsequent page.
Alternatively, you can get the tool
directly from bit.ly/startfresh420.
Reset Windows 7 to make it
faster
If you’re having similar problems in
Windows 7, you can install the operating
system over the top of itself, which will
leave your existing files and applications
untouched, although we’d still
recommend backing them up
beforehand, just in case something goes
wrong. You will need your installation
media for this and can either boot from
the disc or run the setup.exe file on the
DVD from inside Windows.
Click the Install Now button to start
the process and you’ll be given the
option to go online and check for the
latest updates and patches. Selecting
the Upgrade option lets you install the
new OS over an existing version of
Windows. This will leave your personal
files and applications untouched.
To format your hard drive and install
a brand new copy of Windows 7, choose
the Custom (Advanced) option.
Batch-uninstall unwanted
software
The more software you have installed,
the more strain it places on your PC’s
resources, which can negatively impact
its speed. Windows lets you remove
unwanted programs and apps through
its built-in uninstaller, but you’re limited
to removing one item at a time. A
third-party tool such as IObit Uninstaller
(bit.ly/uninst420) can remove multiple

Erase partitions from your hard
drive
Partitioning an old hard drive can have a
negative effect on the speed of your PC
(this isn’t true on newer drives where
the speed will remain consistent), but
you can’t just delete partitions in the
usual way. Fortunately, Windows comes
with its own partitioning tool that you
can use to erase one or more partitions
in a jiffy. Click Start, type partition
and launch the Disk Management
feature. Right-click a partition and you’ll
be able to delete it from there.
Alternatively, you can use a free
program such as MiniTool Partition
Wizard Free 10 (www.partitionwizard
.com) which lets you delete, wipe, copy,
resize and move partitions, and more.
Refresh thumbnails of media files
Windows shows thumbnail previews
of all compatible image and video files,
but these sometimes become
corrupted, or don’t show at all for some
reason. The easiest solution is to use
Disk Cleanup to clear and reset the
Thumbnail Cache. Click Start and type
disk cleanup to launch the tool. Make
sure the system drive is selected and
click OK. Disk Cleanup will check to see
how much space it can free up. When
it’s finished, scroll down the list and
locate Thumbnails. Make sure this
option is selected (select or deselect
Reset Windows 10 without losing
anything
If you’re experiencing major problems
on a PC running Windows 10, such as
slow performance or programs that
won’t run properly, resetting the
operating system should fix things.
This gives you a fresh copy of Windows
and lets you choose whether to keep
your personal files – which is usually
preferable – or remove everything and
start over from scratch. Make sure
you’ve backed up all personal data
beforehand (just in case), then go to
Settings, ‘Update & security’ and click
Recovery on the left. You’ll see an
option to ‘Reset this PC’. Click the
Get Started button and choose whether
to ‘Keep my files’ or ‘Remove

on the next screen.
Start afresh with a clean install of
Windows 10
There is another option you can try if
Windows 10 starts to misbehave, which
is to start over with a completely clean
installation. The problem with this
approach is that once you’ve installed
your original copy of Windows 10, you’ll
then have to install all the newest
updates and that could take a while.
Fortunately, Microsoft has a free tool
that installs only the most recent version
of Windows 10 on your PC, so you’re

other areas to clean at the same time),
then click the ‘Clean up system files’
button. Once complete, your thumbnails
should appear without any problems.
Reset your browser securely
If you’re having problems with your
browser, the cause will probably be
down to one or more add-ons you have
installed, so you should first try
removing any recent additions. If that
doesn’t work, then resetting your
browser probably will. This will remove
all add-ons and load the browser’s
default settings, while keeping your
bookmarks and passwords safe.
To reset Firefox, click the three-line
‘hamburger’ button, click the blue
question mark at the bottom and select
Troubleshooting Information. You can
either choose Safe Mode, which will
restart the browser with all the add-ons
disabled, or Refresh Firefox, which will
remove all add-ons and customisations,
and restore the browser to its default
settings.
To reset Chrome, click the three-dot
icon in the top-right corner and open
Settings. Scroll down to the bottom and
click ‘Show advanced settings’. Scroll
down again and you’ll see a ‘Reset
settings’ section. Click the ‘Reset
settings’ button and confirm you want
to proceed by clicking Reset. Once the
reset is complete, your browser should
be back up to speed.
Reset your Android device
If your Android phone or tablet is having
major problems, resetting it is often the
best solution. Open the Settings menu
and tap ‘Backup & reset’ under
Personal. Make sure ‘Back up my data’ is
switched on, and you have access to the
selected ‘Backup account’. Tap ‘Factory
data reset’ and read the information
that appears on screen, then tap ‘Reset
phone’ (or ‘Reset tablet’). You will need
to enter the pattern, PIN or password
used to unlock the device. Tap ‘Delete
everything’ to remove all data from the
internal storage. When that’s done,
reboot your device.
Resetting your Android device in this
way is pretty drastic because it removes
your Google account, system and app
data and settings, downloaded apps,
music, photos and other user data. The
upside is that once you set up your
Google account again, any data stored
in the cloud will be restored and your
apps will be downloaded again.
Reset iOS devices in different
ways
If you have a seriously misbehaving
Apple device – an iPhone, iPad or iPod
Touch – you can reset it to the defaults
by going to Settings, General. Scroll to
the bottom of the screen and tap Reset.
From here, you can choose any of the
following options, with the most
extreme two at the top:
• Reset All Settings
• Erase All Content and Settings
• Reset Network Settings
• Reset Keyboard Dictionary
• Reset Home Screen Layout
• Reset Location & Privacy
You’ll be prompted to enter your
passcode and Apple ID to complete the
reset process.
Stop default apps being reset in
Windows 10
Windows 10 will occasionally, and
frustratingly, reset your default apps.
For example, one day you might have
Chrome as your default browser and the
next find Edge starting every time you
click a link. This usually happens after
Windows has been updated or
Microsoft has pushed out an update to
one of its built-in apps (such as Edge,
Photos or Groove Music). You can stop
the built-in apps from being set as a
default by using Stop Resetting My
Apps (bit.ly/srma420). To use it, you just
need to run the program and select the
apps to block.

Restore your browser’s
homepage and search engine
Unwanted changes to your web browser
are usually caused by malware or an
unscrupulous program or add-on.
As well as steering you away from the
search engine and homepage that you
want to use, the background processes
responsible can seriously slow you
down and pose a threat to the security
of your PC.
You can try manually changing things
back to how you want them but if that
doesn’t work, you’ll need to identify the
source of the annoyance and remove it.
If you know a recently installed program
is responsible, uninstall it and try
changing back your browser settings.
To check for malware, first start your
PC in Safe mode. To do this quickly in
Windows 10, hold down Shift, tap Start,
click the power button and select
Restart. When your system reboots,
scan it using a tool such as the free
version of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware
(www.malwarebytes.org).
You can also use System Restore to
roll back your operating system to
a time before the browser changes were
made. To do this, click Start and type
restore. Click ‘Create a restore point’.
In the System Properties window, click
System Restore and select a point to
restore from.
Recover accidentally deleted files
When something gets deleted in
Windows, it usually ends up in the
Recycle Bin, but that’s not always the
case. The good news is that the data
doesn’t physically go anywhere; all that
happens is its directory entry and
allocation table data get removed. This
means that although the file may no
longer be visible, it is still there and
it can probably be restored using the
excellent free tool Recuva (www
.piriform.com/recuva). Just make sure
that you don’t install Recuva on the
same drive that contains the files you
want to recover, because it might
overwrite them.
Find old versions of deleted files
Volume Shadow Copy is a built-in
Windows service that takes regular
‘snapshots’ of your system. These
contain older versions of your files and
folders so if something goes missing,
or gets overwritten, you may be able to
get it back without needing to tear out
your hair. ShadowCopyView (www
.nirsoft.net/utils) lets you browse these
snapshots and save a copy of anything
you find. PreviousFilesRecovery, from
the same developer, is a similar tool and
lets you recover old content that no
longer exists.

too. The powerful program Driver

you can use Driver Booster to

Booster effectively.
Find your lost Windows key
If you need your Windows product
key – perhaps to perform a clean
install of the operating system –
but you can’t physically locate it
anywhere, don’t panic because it’s
actually stored in Windows itself.
NirSoft’s ProduKey (www.nirsoft
.net/utils) can find it for you almost
instantly. Right-click to copy the key
to save somewhere safe.
Recover images from a
memory card
SD and microSD memory cards
need to be very robust so the files
they contain don’t just disappear
overnight. If the data on a card has
been lost, it can usually be
recovered using the brilliant free
program Lazesoft Recovery Suite 4
Home Edition (bit.ly/laze420). Just
run the software, choose the Fast
Scan option, point it in the direction
of the memory card and it will
hopefully find and let you recover
the missing images.
Restore a missing CD or DVD
drive
If Windows no longer recognises
your DVD drive, try shutting down
your PC, disconnecting the power
and making sure that all the drive’s
cables are securely plugged in.
Reconnect the power and reboot.
If that doesn’t do the trick, then try
Rizone Soft DVD Drive Repair (bit
.ly/dvdrepair420). In some cases,
the drive may simply have died and
you’ll just have to replace it. See our
Mini Workshop on page 41 to find
out how to use DVD Drive Repair
Restore lost sound on your PC
If audio and video files on your PC
no longer play sound, first check
that the speakers or headphones
are plugged in and haven’t come
loose – it might sound obvious, but
it happens a lot! Next, check to
make sure that the sound on your
PC hasn’t been muted. You should
see a speaker icon in the system
tray. Double-click this and you’ll be
able to mute and unmute sound,
and adjust the volume.
If some files are playing sound
but others aren’t, then it will likely
be a codec problem. Install the free
K-Lite Codec Pack from www

codecs.

Revive an old PC
If you have an old PC that’s running
very sluggishly but you don’t
want to get rid of it, and
upgrading or replacing it
isn’t an option, then you
could try running a less
resource-hungry operating
system. If you’ve only ever used
Windows, then switching to a
Linux distro will take a little getting
used to, but the good news is that
you can try the OS live, without
needing to install it. Three excellent
lightweight operating systems you can
try are Puppy Linux (puppylinux.org),
Lubuntu (lubuntu.me) and Pixel (bit.ly/
pixel420). The latter is the Debian-
based operating system that’s used on
the Raspberry Pi.
Switch to an SSD
You may think your old, slow laptop or
desktop PC is on its last legs, but if it
has an HDD (hard disk drive), then
upgrading to an SSD (solid state drive)
will give the device a whole new lease of
life. Your computer will boot up much
more quickly, and writing and reading
data will be significantly faster. SSDs
cost more than traditional hard drives,
and tend to have a smaller capacity, but
you can always add a hard drive for
storage – to keep your photos, music,
videos and documents on – alongside
the speedy system drive.
Replace a dying hard drive
If your hard drive is failing, it’s important
to get the data off it as quickly as
possible. Check on the drive’s SMART
(Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and
Reporting Technology) status using
CrystalDiskInfo (crystalmark.info) to
make sure the problems you’re
experiencing are due to hard disk
failure. Assuming they are, use a tool
such as Clonezilla (clonezilla.org) or
MiniTool Partition Wizard Free 10 (www
.partitionwizard.com) to clone as much
of the drive as you can to a replacement
disk. The sooner you act, the more data
you will be able to save.
Fix a program that won’t launch
If you have a program that has stopped
launching, try reinstalling it over itself.
This may overwrite any problematic
Registry entries and replace any missing
components. If that doesn’t work, try

uninstalling it first, then reinstalling it.
If you still get no joy, try running it in

right-click the program’s executable file

You can also try using the

Replace your phone’s battery
Some Android phones have removable
batteries, so if your phone is no longer
charging, or is failing to hold its charge,
then it’s time to get a new battery.
You may be able to find a cheap
replacement on Amazon or eBay, but
make sure you check the reviews first.
Flagship phones, such as the iPhone
and Samsung Galaxy S7, don’t have
removable batteries but your phone
manufacturer will be able to replace it

What we liked:
TeamViewer’s impressive
array of features
immediately elevates
it above its rivals. It not
only works as a powerful
remote-Desktop program,
but it also supports file
transfers, remote presentations and
video calls, making it an excellent
choice whether you want to access your
own PC remotely or offer technical
support to friends and family.
Setting up the software is very
straightforward – you can choose
between basic installation or running
TeamViewer just once. To initiate
a remote connection, simply type the
remote PC’s ID and password into the
PC you’re working from. There’s no
need to set up an account, although
doing so brings some perks including
faster access to PCs you use regularly.
After starting a session, TeamViewer
offers a handy summary of important
information about the remote PC at the
click of a button, including its current
processor, memory and hard-drive
usage. There are also details about its
system and security software, which
can be useful when troubleshooting.
TeamViewer has shortcuts for frequent
actions including lock, reboot and ‘send
Ctrl+Alt+Del’. You can also opt to record
the remote session, transfer files or start
an internet call.
Despite the wealth of tools and
options, TeamViewer’s interface is
simple and intuitive, even if you aren’t
familiar with remote-Desktop software.
We found the software’s performance
was fast and seamless, to the extent
that we almost forgot we were using it
(and ended up writing large chunks of
this feature remotely!).
There are TeamViewer apps for iOS
and Android, so you can access your PC
remotely from those devices, too.
How it can be improved:
There’s little to fault in TeamViewer,
but it does frequently invite you to buy
a commercial licence (it’s free for
personal use) and it also includes ads
for the developer’s security software.
OUR VERDICT
TeamViewer is packed with features,
easy to use and completely free.
If you’re looking for remote-
Desktop software, whatever the
reason, it comfortably tops our list
of recommendations.
Remote-Desktop software lets you access your computer from
anywhere in the world and offer technical support to others.

What we liked:
Developed by
ex-TeamViewer
employees, AnyDesk
is incredibly simple to set
up and works immediately
without requiring
installation. Creating a remote
connection is as easy as entering a PC’s
unique ID (given by AnyDesk) on your
PC and then approving the connection
from the remote PC. Alternatively, you
can set a password on any PC to enable
unattended access.
The program offers a range of handy
options including whether to give the
host full control of the PC (as opposed
to just screen sharing) and whether
to allow them to hear sound. Seamless
file transfers are supported via a shared
clipboard, meaning you can copy and
paste any files from the remote PC to
your Desktop, and – as with TeamViewer
– there are shortcuts for important
system information and common
actions. AnyDesk also supports text-
based chat, which is useful when giving
technical support. If you want to control
your PC on the go, AnyDesk has free
apps for both iOS and Android.
What we liked:
Chrome Remote Desktop
offers quick and easy
remote access to your
own and other people’s
PCs. Although remote
connections are initiated via
a browser app, it works like any
other remote-Desktop tool, giving you
full control over the remote PC. This
means you can open any program or
file, access important Windows settings
in Control Panel and shut down or
restart the PC when you’re finished.
In fact, Chrome Remote Desktop runs
in the background all the time, so you
can use it to log back into Windows
when the PC starts up again.
If you’ve set your browser to sync
apps, you only need to install it once and
it’ll be available on all your PCs. You’ll
need to enable access on any PC you
want to use remotely, but once you’ve
done so, you can access it at any time
by simply entering the appropriate PIN.
As with our other award winners, you
can use iOS and Android apps to
control your PC from your smartphone.
How it can be improved:
Chrome Remote Desktop lacks many of
the features of our other award winners,
in particular the option to transfer files.
There’s also no support for unattended
access on PCs belonging to others.
How it can be improved:
If you’re looking for tools such as video
chat and remote screen recording,
AnyDesk falls short. Unlike our other
award winners, it also caused Windows
Firewall to throw up a warning the first
time we used it.
OUR VERDICT
AnyDesk lacks some of the fancy
features of TeamViewer, but is
otherwise a fast remote-Desktop
tool that includes support for file
transfers. If, for some reason, you
want an alternative to TeamViewer,
AnyDesk is well worth a try.
OUR VERDICT
Chrome Remote Desktop’s easy
setup will appeal to Chrome users
who don’t want to install additional
software, but it’s light on features
so we’d recommend trying one of
our other award winners if you want
a full remote-Desktop experience.
AeroAdmin
bit.ly/aeroadmin420
AeroAdmin is a lightweight remote-
Desktop tool that can be set up
quickly and easily without
installation. However, some features
including file transfer are not
supported
in the free
version,
which is
marred by
pop-up
ads. We
also found
the
program’s
interface looked ugly and outdated
compared with those of our other
award winners.
Screenleap
www.screenleap.com
If you want to share your screen
with several people, Screenleap
is the perfect tool for the task.
By downloading its lightweight app,
which allows viewers to see your
screen in their web browsers,
you can share a URL in seconds.
Unfortunately, viewing is limited
to an hour a day and, unlike some
other tools in this round-up, there’s
no option to give users control of
your PC.
Ultra VNC
www.uvnc.com
Ultra VNC is a powerful, open-
source remote-Desktop tool that
supports file transfers and text-
based chat. However, it’s aimed at
advanced users, not those looking
to help less tech-savvy friends and
family. Indeed, even downloading
the setup file feels like hard work
and setting up the tool requires an
understanding of port forwarding,
so we’d steer clear unless you’re
a networking expert.

Install apps that
Google Play blocks
When Google tells you that an app is
only compatible with “some of your
devices”, it’s usually because it will work
on your phone but not your tablet,
or because one of your devices doesn’t
have the necessary version of Android.
This is different from an app being
“incompatible with all your devices”,
which is usually due to geographical
restrictions – and regular Web User
readers know how we feel about those!
If you’re unable to use an app for the
latter reason, you could feasibly solve
the problem by using a VPN. However, if
you’ve previously bought
an app from Play, your account will
be locked to the UK, so you’ll still be
blocked. One way around this is to
create a new Google account, add it to
your Android device and open the Play
Store app from there using a VPN such
as TunnelBear (www.tunnelbear.com).
Alternatively, you could go into
Settings, then Security on your device,
allow the installation of apps from
unknown sources, then find and
download the APK file of the app.
However, this can be very risky because
many APK files contain malware.
Update all your
apps in one go
The Play Store website lets you see
all the apps you have installed, but
if you want to update them – either
individually or collectively – you’ll need
to use the app version. Open this on
your phone or tablet, then tap the
three-line menu button in the top-left
corner and choose ‘My apps & games’.
In the list of installed apps, either click
Update next to all those that need
updating or tap the Update All button.
This screen also lists any beta apps you
may have volunteered to test, so you
can get the latest updates.
Create a wishlist
of Play content
The Play Store is so vast that it’s easy
to stumble across an interesting app,
game, album or film, then not be able to
find it again when you decide to buy it
(perhaps when you’ve earned enough
Rewards credit, as per our first tip).
To make sure this doesn’t happen, it’s
worth compiling a ‘wishlist’ of content
you want to purchase or download
at a later date – much as you would on
Amazon. Just click the ‘Add to wishlist’
option above the Buy or Install button.
You can access your wishlist via the link
on the left-hand side of the page.
To remove an item, click the ‘Added
to wishlist’ option above the button.
Get refunds for
unwanted purchases
You can claim a refund for an unwanted
app or other purchase by going to your
Account on the Play Store website
or in the app and scrolling down to your
order history. If the item is an app or
game, you can claim your money back
without question for two hours after
you installed it, simply by selecting
Refund. If the app or game is defective,
not as you expected or was bought
accidentally, click the three-dot icon
next to the purchase and choose
‘Report a problem’. Select your reason
for not wanting the app or game and
click Submit, but make sure you do so
within 48 hours, before the option
disappears.
Likewise, you have up to seven days
to request a refund on any Google Play
Music, Movies and TV purchases,
provided you haven’t started playing
the song, film or show.
You’re no doubt familiar with Google
Play app categories such as Tools,
Entertainment and Photography, but
the store also has a hidden section
called Indie Corner. Here, you’ll find
apps from small developers who risk
getting swamped by larger ones in the
main store. Or, as Google puts it: “the
latest and most innovative releases,
our current favourites and must-have
Indie masterpieces all in one place”.
Indie Corner isn’t listed in the Play
Store’s menus, but you can access it
directly at bit.ly/indie420. Currently,
the section features the Top 10 finalists of the Google Play Indie Games
Contest, including the amazingly cute and addictive Happy Hop: Kawaii Jump.

Free Wi-Fi on public
transport
Most rail operators only offer free Wi-Fi
in First Class, but some networks allow
free internet with a standard ticket. For
example, if you book a ticket directly
through Virgin Trains East Coast, you
can get free Wi-Fi throughout the train
(for more details, see bit.ly/virgin420).
Great Anglia also offers free Wi-Fi to all
customers using its Intercity services
between Norwich, Ipswich and London
(bit.ly/anglia420), and more than 50%
of South West Trains come with free
internet on board (bit.ly/southwest420).
Free Wi-Fi can also be found on all
Gatwick Express, Grand Central, Hull
Trains and Chiltern Railways services,
and most ScotRail routes, although
terms and conditions vary from one
operator to the next.
Free Wi-Fi access is currently being
rolled out across all National Express
coach services (it should be available on
all routes from this summer). Sessions
are limited to 30 minutes, but you can
also access a range of entertainment for
the full duration of your journey via the
company’s VUER app, which is available
on iOS (bit.ly/vueri420) and Android
(bit.ly/vuera420). Download the app
before you travel, though, because the
on-board Wi-Fi restricts app downloads!
Essential apps for free Wi-Fi
Having the right app installed on your
phone can make it easier to find and
access free Wi-Fi. The Android and iOS
app WiFi Map (www.wifimap.io), for
example, shows
you the closest
Wi-Fi hotspots
and also includes
passwords to
make joining
them quick and
easy – you won’t
even need to ask
for login details.
The problem
with many free
Wi-Fi networks
is that they don’t
Free Wi-Fi is widely available, but connecting isn’t always easy.
Edward Munn reveals how to access fast, safe and free public Wi-Fi
always offer fast or reliable internet
connections. Speed Test (bit.ly/
speedt420) provides crowdsourced
data displaying the location of the
nearest hotspots along with details of
download and upload speeds.
WiFi Mapper (www.wifimapper.com)
is another excellent free app that can
help you find the best free hotspots
nearby. Available for Android and iOS,
it covers nearly 500 million Wi-Fi
networks worldwide and more than two
million recommended free hotspots.
Not only does the app show what kind
of venue the hotspot is in and how
reliable the internet connection is, it also
tells you if the place has good coffee!
Get free Wi-Fi from your
internet provider
If you’re a BT broadband customer,
you’re entitled to unlimited free Wi-Fi at
more than five million hotspots via BT
WiFi (formerly BT OpenZone). Most BT
HomeHubs double up as hotspots, so
you should never struggle to find a safe
and stable connection. If you do, simply
visit www.btwifi.com/find and enter
your current location to find the nearest
hotspot. The easiest way to get online is
to simply install the BT Wi-Fi app for
Android (bit.ly/btwifia420) or iOS
(bit.ly/btwifii420), which saves your
username and password and connects
you automatically whenever you’re in
range of a hotspot.
Sky Broadband customers can access

Discuss ﬁnding free Wi-Fi at forum.webuser.co.uk
a similar, albeit smaller service by
installing Sky Wi-Fi for iOS (bit.ly/
skywifii420) or Android (bit.ly/
skywifia420). You can register up to six
wireless-enabled devices. The app
includes a handy hotspot finder and will
automatically connect you to free
hotspots whenever you’re in range.
Virgin Media
helps to keep
its broadband
customers
connected when
they’re out and
about with Virgin
Media Wi-Fi.
The company
claims its service
enables you to
“connect to
nearly half of all
UK public Wi-Fi hotspots in all sorts of
places – cafés, bars and restaurants,
up and down the high street, in airports
and even underground!” The Android
app is available from bit.ly/vmwifia420
and you can install the iOS version from
bit.ly/vmwifii420.
If you don’t have a contract with one
of the above ISPs, you can access
15,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots via O2 Wi-Fi.
O2 customers can connect to 4,500 of
these hotspots automatically and even if
you’re not a customer, you can preserve
your mobile data allowance by
registering to use free Wi-Fi. Just look
out for ‘O2 Wi-Fi’ in your device’s
network list at establishments including
McDonalds, House of Fraser, Costa and
Pizza Hut.
Use your phone as a hotspot
If you can’t find a free Wi-Fi hotspot
using any of the above tips, another way
to get online quickly is to use your
phone as a personal hotspot. Only some
devices support ‘tethering’, and costs
can vary significantly (according to your
tariff), so we recommend checking with
your network provider before risking
any additional charges.
To enable tethering on your phone,
open Settings and, under ‘Wireless and
networks’, tap More, then ‘Tethering and
personal hotspot’. Next, tap ‘Portable
Wi-Fi Hotspot’ to turn the hotspot on
and then choose ‘Set up Wi-Fi hotspot’
and ‘Show password’ to see the network
name and password. Finally, choose this
network on your wireless-enabled
devices and enter the appropriate
password to get online and start using
your mobile’s data connection. These
steps might vary, but should work in
a similar way on Android devices from
most manufacturers.
Note that tethering will cause your
phone’s battery to drain more quickly
than normal usage. If you’re browsing
the web on a laptop, you’re likely to use
more data than if loading the same
pages on a mobile device. To keep an
eye on how much data you’ve used,
install Glasswire (bit.ly/glasswire419),
which displays a permanent notification
indicating your data usage for a set
period. We had a Workshop about this
excellent tool in our last issue.
There are inherent security risks and
privacy implications to using public Wi-Fi
networks, but it’s easy to protect yourself
if you know how. First, check the terms and
conditions of the hotspot provider carefully
to see what personal information you’re
expected to share to get online for a short
period of time. Next, make sure you only
visit websites that support secure ‘https’
connections. You’ll know that your connection is encrypted when you see
a padlock in your browser’s address bar and this makes it much
more difficult for would-be hackers to intercept your data.
You can also encrypt your traffic by installing a VPN.
CyberGhost (cyberghostvpn.com) is one of our favourites and it’s
free on Windows, Android and iOS. If you’re using a Windows
laptop on a public network, make sure that file sharing is turned
off. To check this, open Control Panel then click ‘Network and
Internet’, ‘Network and Sharing Centre’ and ‘Change advanced
sharing settings’. Finally, if you must do your online banking
on the go, it’s always safer to use your mobile data
connection than a public hotspot.

nstagram and Prisma (for Android
and iOS) come with fancy filters to
transform your digital snaps into
works of art. Painnt is a photo-editing
app for Windows 10 that lets you apply
a similar range of filters. There are over
240 different styles to choose from, with
new ones added regularly, all sorted into
categories such as Classic, Modern,
Mosaic, Nature, Sketch and Trippy.
There are a few restrictions in the free
version – some filters aren’t available,
output resolution is limited to HD quality
and your image is labelled with a small
watermark. But you can unlock
everything via an in-app purchase – one
week of full access costs £1.49, one
month is £2.29 and one year is £7.69.

T
he joy of owning several different devices is that you can use
them in conjunction with each other – using a PC program to
edit photos you shot on your phone, or viewing
documents on your tablet that are safely stored on your PC.
However, transferring those files between your devices can
be a convoluted process involving portable drives,
download cables and even emailing items to yourself.
Dukto (bit.ly/dukto420) is a file-sharing tool you can install
on all your devices, whatever operating systems they use.
Unlike previous Web User favourite Pushbullet, which
now restricts several features to its paid-for Pro
version, Dukto is open-source software, so it’s
completely free of charge. You don’t even have to
install it because there’s a portable version available.

adapted to work on a range of alternative
operating systems, which could breathe
new life into your old devices. As well as
Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS,
the software has been ported onto Nokia’s
Maemo OS (bit.ly/maemo420) and RIM’s
BlackBerry (bit.ly/black420); and there’s a
bizarre Linux variant called OpenPandora
(bit.ly/open420) that works on tiny

Back on the sending PC, the connection with the current
recipient stays live, in case you want to follow up the
message with a file. Drag and drop anything you want to
send to the Dukto window 1 and it will be beamed across to
the recipient. If there’s nothing more to send, click the Back
arrow. 2
6
By default, sent files land on the recipient’s Desktop along
with a notification in ‘recent’, which they can click to view
the file. To send files or folders at a later date, either click
the appropriate button 1 or drag and drop files to the window.
Everything will appear in the recipient’s ‘recent’ tab, as with the
other files and messages.
7
If you’d prefer to have the files sent somewhere other than
the Desktop, you can change this by clicking the Settings
button. Click the ‘Change folder’ button 1 and select
a different folder. You can also change the theme colour from
here. 2
8
If you have an
Android phone
or tablet, there’s
a mobile version of the
app (bit.ly/dukand420)
that works in exactly the
same way as the
Windows version.
As long as you’re on the
same network, you’ll be
able to see all your other
devices and, reciprocally,
your Android device will
appear on their screens.
10
It’s possible to send files outside your network, as
long as the receiving device has an IP address that
can be accessed from the wider internet. If this is the
case, click on the ‘IP connection’ button. In the Destination box,
type the IP address of the device you want to connect to 1 and
choose from the menu of options below.

The iOS app (bit.ly/
dukios420) has been
developed
independently so it works
in a slightly different way
and is supported by
adverts. It uses the same
underlying process, though,
with contacts listed below,
and it’s completely
compatible. You may have
to set up the app – in the
iOS version, for example,
tap User 1 to change the
name.

Click the ‘Select your token’ menu. The site lets you create
lots of different types of token but if you want to protect
folders on your PC, choose the Windows Folder option. 1
Type the email address you want the alert to be sent to in the
box below.
2
In the third box, 1 type a descriptive reminder of where
you’re planning to put the token. This information will be

token, you’ll know which one has been accessed. Click the
‘Create my Canarytoken’ button. 2
3
Click the ‘Manage this token’ link. If the token isn’t yet
installed, you can only choose to enable or disable email
alerts; 1 if the token has been triggered, you can also
view its history. 2 Bookmark the URL or make a note of it, in
case you need to return before the token has been triggered. 4
Click ‘Download your zip file’ and unzip its contents,
placing them into the folder you want to guard.
If someone triggers the token by opening the folder,
the service will send you an email. 1 The Token Reminder 2
will correspond with the note you set up in Step 2.
5
Click the ‘More info on this token here’ link to see a list of
all the times the folder has been accessed, 1 with the
most recent events at the top. A map displays the location
of the computers that created the events. 2
6
Click an event to see more information about it, including
the location of the user 1 and the organisation
associated with the IP address. 2 This should give you
some idea about the trespasser and will confirm whether the
snooper is sitting at your PC or accessing it remotely.
Find out if someone’s accessing your files
I
f you’re suspicious that people are accessing the files and
folders on your PC, or you’d like to know if it ever happens,
you can place a guard on your folders to inform you of any
trespassers. Canarytokens (www.canarytokens.org) is a simple
website that creates a file (or ‘token’)
which sits in any folder on your PC . If that
folder is opened, your token sends you
an alert via email.

Scan files for malware before you download them
M
etadefender is a handy Chrome add-on that lets
you scan any file on the web for malware before
you download it. The tool uses a collection of
39 security scanners (including AVG, Bitdefender and
Microsoft) to check that a file is safe and
provide important information about it, so
you can be certain you’re downloading the
correct item.
Metadefender: bit.ly/mdef420 |
10 mins |
Chrome
1
Install Metadefender for Chrome. Right-click a file you
want to download, then select ‘Scan with Metadefender
before downloading’. 1 A new tab opens, displaying
the scan results for the selected file.
2
It shows the number of scan engines that identify your
download as a threat, 1 and displays other info 2
including the file type, its size and the dates for when it
was uploaded and last scanned. You can use the hash values
to confirm that the file hasn’t been tampered with.
3
If the last scan date was some time ago, click Rescan
to update the report. For executable files and setup
files, you can click the PE Info tab 1 to view more
information about the file, 2 including the product name,
publisher and file version.
4
If your download was identified as a threat by any of
the scanners, click the Known Vulnerabilities tab 1
for more information. If it wasn’t, click Scan History 2
to see if it’s been flagged as dangerous in the past. Click
‘View details’ 3 on any entry to view the full scan report.
5
By default, Metadefender scans all your downloads, so
wait for its pop-up tab to appear before opening any
files you’re unsure about. This method is more reliable
than right-clicking files to use the extension, which
sometimes scans the HTML 1 instead of the source file.
6
To disable auto-scanning, click the extension’s button in
the browser’s toolbar and untick ‘Scan all downloads’. 1
From this menu, you can also view your own scan
history 2 and choose whether your scans should be shared
with the Metadefender community. 3

remotely from any browser. David Ludlow explains how to use it
How to use the web interface
The Kodi web interface gives you access
to all the music and video you can
access from Kodi, from any device with
a browser. The display is designed to
be used close up, so it includes more
options and controls than the TV-screen
version, making it easier to navigate.
You can even use it to access Kodi over
the internet, as we show you in our
Mini Workshop, opposite.
T
he Kodi smartphone app is
a great way to get all the
features of a remote control for
Kodi (and a little more). However, the
media software also has a built-in
web server that gives you even more
control over Kodi from any device
that has a web browser.
For example, you can use the web
interface to browse all your audio and
video content and select what to
watch or listen to. There’s currently
no support for photos, but that’s the
only thing that’s missing.
From the web browser, anything
you select to watch is played on your
Kodi device. You’ve got full control
over playback, using the on-screen
controls, and the web interface can
send your keyboard commands to
Kodi to control the box remotely.
If you’d rather just watch the
content on the remote device,
you can do that, too. In this guide,
we’ll show you how to set up and
configure the web browser in our
Mini Workshop on page 59, and tell
you how to get more from it.

content will play immediately on your
Kodi box. You can use the playback
controls at the bottom of the browser
to play, pause, fast forward and rewind
through your content.

Play button, you get more information

and more cast details. If you click an
album, you get the full track listing,
so you can pick which track to play.
Queue content
On the right-hand side of the screen,
if you click the Kodi button, you can see
the current playback queue with
selectable headers for Audio and Video.
Playing an album puts every song into
the queue automatically. You can add
other audio tracks or create a video
playback queue. Just browse to the
music or video you want and click the
Queue button.
Select any item in the queue to play
it immediately. You can drag and drop
queue items to reorder them. Hovering
over an item and clicking the ‘X’ icon
removes an item from the queue.

On your Kodi device, go to Settings,
Services, then click the Control tab.
1 Turn on the ‘Allow remote control
via HTTP’ option. 2 Make a note of the
port (8080) and username (kodi) 3
– you’ll need these later. Add a
password 4 for security, so that your
Kodi box can only be controlled by an
authorised user.
2
Next, find your Kodi box’s IP address,
so you can connect to it from
another device. The easiest way to do
this is to go to Settings, ‘System info’,
Summary. 1 Make a note of the reported
IP address. 2
3
To connect to the web server, you
need to be using another device
on the same network. In a browser,
type the following code http://
<kodi_IP_address>:8080
replacing the middle section
(including brackets) with the IP
address. The bit after the colon is the
port number that you noted down in
Step 1. Press Enter. If you made a
password in Step 1, enter it now.

you can open up
Kodi to the internet
and stream music
remotely, too.

We’ve only got room to cover
remote control and streaming music
here – it’s harder to get streaming
video working. Set up a password on
your Kodi web server and find out its
local IP address as in Step 2 of the Mini
Workshop on page 59. You’ll also need
to know your external IP address or
use a dynamic DNS service such as
No-IP (bit.ly/noip420).
2
Log into your router’s web-
management page and look for the
port forwarding or virtual servers
setting. Add a new rule and set the
external port as 80 1 (so you don’t have
to type in the ‘:8080’ bit to connect);
the internal IP address as the one you
use to connect to your Kodi box; 2 the
internal port as 8080; 3 and the
protocol as TCP. 4
3
Save your settings. Now, when
you’re out and about, you can
type in your home’s IP address or
your dynamic DNS address, and
you’ll be able to access Kodi 1 from
anywhere in the world.
MINI WORKSHOP | Control Kodi from the internet
Stream content
Kodi can stream content directly to your
device. Just navigate to the content you
want to play (audio or video), then click
the Stream button and Kodi sends it
straight to your browser. Video content
requires you to connect to
a local network and plays
in a pop-out browser; music
is contained inside the main
browser and you can use
the controls to manage
playback.
Manage a video
stream
The default settings for the
video stream should work
well, but there are a few
settings in the pop-out
window that you can
change. First, you can use the drop-
down menu on the left-hand side of the
screen to select the video stream:
HTML5 is the default and best option,
but you can switch to VLC stream if
you’re having problems. To go full-
screen, click the icon to the right of the
remaining time indicator.
Download for later
If you’re on a slow connection or want to
make files available for offline use, Kodi’s
web interface has a download option,
too. Just browse to the content that you
want to watch. For video files, click the
More button. Select Download from the
menu and the original file will be saved
to your hard disk.
Music downloads work in a slightly
different way and Kodi doesn’t provide a
method for downloading whole albums.
Instead, you can only save individual
files to your computer. Browse to the
album, hover over a track, click the three
dots (‘...’) and select ‘Download song’.
The original file will be saved to your
hard drive.
Choosing the type of video stream can help solve any
problems you may be having

and, in the new panel that opens, click
the plus button to add a folder.
Folders provide an excellent system
for keeping your inbox free of clutter.
Simply click and drag messages from
the inbox and drop them in a relevant
folder to move them. Select a folder
to see the email messages it contains.
Use labels in Gmail
Gmail uses labels to organise
emails, but they can be made
to work in a similar way to folders.
Open an email and click the Labels
button in the toolbar. Select ‘Create
new’ at the bottom. Enter a short
name for the label – such as Work,
Personal or Family – then click Create.
Labels appear in the email list and
also in the sidebar. Select one in the
sidebar to see only emails with that
label. Your labelled messages will still
appear in the inbox so if you want to
declutter it, click and drag the emails
to a label in the sidebar. This
removes them from the inbox,
but you can still see them
by clicking the relevant label.
Archive old messages
Archiving emails
removes them
from the inbox but it doesn’t
delete them – effectively, it just
removes Google’s ‘Inbox’ label.
It’s a great way to keep your
inbox clear.
In Gmail, open or select an
email and click the Archive
button. Existing labels aren’t
removed so it will still appear
T
he Windows 10 Mail app has some
excellent tools designed specifically
for touchscreen devices.
Swiping either left or right over an email
in the Inbox list performs an action such as
Archive, Delete, ‘Move to Junk’ and so on.
You can set the action you want in the Quick
Actions panel. To access this, tap the cog icon
in the bottom of the left-hand panel, then tap
Quick Actions in the panel on the right. Choose
the action from the drop-down menus. If you
swipe halfway across the screen, the action
is displayed underneath the email to remind
you of what’s going to happen.
If you long-press an email in the inbox list,
a menu of actions is displayed. Simply tap
the one you want to carry out the action.
Use Windows 10 Mail on touchscreen devices
Pin Outlook.com emails
As you receive new emails, your
previous messages are pushed
down the inbox and eventually
disappear off the bottom of the list.
Outlook lets you pin important emails
to the top of the inbox so they don’t get
lost. Move the mouse over the message
in the inbox list and click the pin.
Use folders
Outlook.com and the
Windows 10 Mail app
provide folders for organising your
messages. In Outlook, hover the mouse
over Folders in the sidebar, then click
the plus sign that appears and enter a
folder name, such as Work or Family. In
the Windows 10 Mail app, click Folders
Define the actions for swipes when using

by searching for it, or by clicking More,
then All Mail in the sidebar.
In Outlook.com, open or select emails
in the inbox and click Archive in the
menu at the top. The messages are
moved to the Archive folder, which will
be created if it doesn’t already exist.
Select the Archive folder to see your
archived messages.
Mark emails you’ve replied to
When you put off replying to
an email until later, you risk
forgetting about it altogether. There’s
a way you can mark those that have
been dealt with, so you can tell just
by looking at your Gmail inbox which
messages you have replied to.
Immediately to the left of an email
in the inbox is a star icon. Click it and
click it again until it becomes a double-
headed arrow or a green tick. Use this
symbol as a reminder that you have
replied to or dealt with a message.
If you don’t see these symbols, click
the cog icon and select Settings. In the
Stars section on the General tab, drag
symbols from the ‘Not in use’ to the
‘In use’ list. They can now be accessed
from your inbox.
Find emails with attachments
Your Gmail storage space
is limited and shared with
your Drive and Photos accounts. If you
frequently send or receive mail with
large files and photos attached, they
could be consuming a lot of storage
and you may run out of space for
your emails.
One way to recover space is to find
the biggest emails and delete them.
In the Gmail search box, type
has:attachment to list all emails with
attached files and delete any you don’t
need. These messages are moved to the
Bin but the space won’t be recovered
until it’s emptied. Click More in the
sidebar, select Bin and click ‘Empty Bin
now’ at the top.
With Outlook.com, search for
anything – ‘a’ for example – then select
‘With attachments’ in the sidebar to list
messages with attachments. Delete
any you don’t need.
Sort Gmail with rules
The easiest way to create a rule
is to open an email you want to
label, move or delete. Click the More
button and select ‘Filter messages like
these’. A form appears with lots of
options – the simplest is From. This
can be a specific person, such as
webuser@dennis.co.uk or anyone
from a domain, such as dennis.co.uk.
Click ‘Create filter with this search’
and a list of actions is displayed.
One or more can be selected, such as
‘Star it’, ‘Apply the label’, and ‘Always
mark it as important’. Click ‘Create
filter’ and the actions will
automatically be applied to matching
emails as they arrive.
Unsend emails
Have you ever clicked the
Send button and then
immediately realised you made
a mistake? Wouldn’t it be useful
to cancel it? Well, you can!
In Gmail, click the cog icon and
select Settings. Select the General
tab and, in the Undo Send section,
find ‘Send cancellation period’. Click
the list and select the longest time –
30 seconds. Click Save at the bottom.
Now, when you send a message,
an alert will appear for 30 seconds
with an option to Undo it.
Run Gmail like
an app
You can turn Gmail
into an app that runs
in its own window instead of
in your browser. Open
Explorer and locate Chrome.
You’ll find it in either:
C:\Program Files (x86)\
Google\Chrome\Application
or
C:\Program Files\Google\
Chrome\Application
Right-click the Chrome
icon and select ‘Send to’,
then ‘Desktop (create
shortcut)’. Right-click the
Desktop shortcut and click Properties.
Change the name at the top of the
General tab to ‘Gmail’. Now select
the Shortcut tab, click in the Target
box, add a space to the end of
whatever is there and type:
--app=https://mail.google.com
Click OK.
You can now click the Desktop icon
to run Gmail like an app. It will open
in its own window without an address
box or toolbar.
Sort Outlook.com mail with
rules
Rules perform actions on emails
as they arrive. They can delete
junk, add labels, move messages
and more, and are very useful for
organising messages automatically,
saving you time and effort.
The easiest way to create a rule
is to open a message, then click the
three-dots icon in the menu bar and
select ‘Create rule’. A rule is created
automatically, but you will probably
need to customise it. For example,
you’ll see a series of conditions
displayed, including who the message
is from, who it is to, and the subject.
Delete the ‘to’ and ‘subject’, leaving
just the ‘from’.
Add actions under ‘Do all of the
following’, such as ‘Move the message
to folder’. Click the link on the
right and select a folder. More
actions can be added, such as
marking it, pinning it and so on.
Click OK to save the rule.

mark messages

Transfer music from your
tablet to a USB stick
Q
My old Samsung Galaxy Tab has lots
of music on it that I copied from CDs
and transferred using my laptop.
Unfortunately, my laptop has stopped
working due to a motherboard problem.
I need to transfer the music from the
tablet to a USB memory stick so I can
play it in my car, because it has no CD
player. Alternatively, I could transfer the
files to an iPad. I assume the tracks need
to be in MP3 format to play in my car.
Neal Latham, via email
A
Most modern Android phones and
tablets support USB storage, such
as hard drives and USB sticks. All you
need is a cable with a micro USB plug
on one end and a standard USB socket
on the other. Samsung calls this an
‘on the go’ (OTG) USB adapter cable.
There’s an example at Amazon at bit.ly/
otg420, and the related links section
shows several alternatives. Not all
phones and tablets are supported, but
the cable costs just £2.95 with free
delivery, so it’s worth a gamble even
if yours isn’t on the compatibility list.
Your tablet should recognise the cable
and the USB memory stick as a storage
device when you plug it in. Use the file
manager to copy your music to the
USB stick. MP3 is the most widely
supported file format for music but
your car might support others.
MOBILE
Solve app-updating problems
Q
I have two Android devices – a
Motorola phone and a 6in tablet –
and I’ve had a lot of trouble updating
apps. Whenever I update an app on the
tablet, it’s sent to my phone as well.
I solved this by deleting my Google
account on my tablet and setting up
a new one, but why does this happen?
Robert Cull, via email
A
Google Play Store has a feature
called Family Library (bit.ly/
fam420), which lets you share apps,
movies, music, books and games
between five family members. If any
of these items is added to one Android
device, all the other devices have access
to it. This is useful when installing
messaging apps, for example, because
it means you all have the same one.
If Family Library has been set up on
your Android devices, it would explain
why an app installed on your tablet
appears on your phone, because each
device in the family group would get it.
To check, open the Google Play Store,
tap the menu button, then Account. Tap
Family, Family Library Settings. Select
each category of items and tap ‘Don’t
Q
Is there such a thing as a box
that plugs into a TV, and
which provides the full internet
access that you get on a PC?
I’ve been searching for years but
haven’t found anything that promises
the complete internet.
I want to be able to watch videos on
my TV that I currently have to access
through my PC. As I understand it,
such a box would need a high-end
browser that supports Flash, and
built-in software to play DivX videos.
Paul Aungiers, via email
A
A standalone box would require
some sort of input device to type
URLs, click links and buttons on web
pages, access menus and so on. In
other words, what you actually need
is a box and a remote control.
If you already have a mobile device
such as a phone or tablet, there are
a couple of great options. For Android
users, there’s Chromecast (bit.ly/
cast420); for Apple devices, there’s
Apple TV (bit.ly/appletv420). Both of
these TV devices can receive
streaming video from a compatible
phone or tablet, and they couldn’t be
easier to use. Just start a video
playing on your device, tap a button
and it appears on your TV.
You can also mirror your phone or
tablet’s screen so that it appears on
the TV. This means you can browse
the web using Chrome or Safari on
your mobile device and view it on the
big screen. Mobile devices are pretty
good at voice recognition, too, so you
don’t even need to type anything –
just tell your tablet or phone what you
want to do.

solutions, and we don’t know which
applies in your case, so your best bet
is to try them all. First, right-click the
Desktop and make sure View, ‘Show
desktop items’ is selected. Hide the
icons, then show them again. Right-click
and select Sort by, Name.
Do you have a clean-up tool? If so,
it might be cleaning up the Desktop as
part of an automatic scheduled clean
and hiding old or rarely used icons.
If you have one, turn this option off.
You can see your Desktop icons in
Explorer by viewing the Desktop folder.
Right-click an icon that has disappeared,
select Properties and check the
Attributes section to see if Hidden
is ticked. If it is, remove the tick.
Icons sometimes move around when
Windows changes the Desktop
resolution, so if you ever do this, it may
be the cause. Some games change the
resolution automatically, so check to see
if it happens after playing a game.
Connecting a second monitor or TV can
also cause icons to disappear. If you
unplug your second monitor and restart
Windows, the icons should come back.
Another solution that works for
some people is to right-click the
Desktop and select ‘Display settings’.
Use the drop-down menu to ‘Change
the size of text, apps and other items’.
Close ‘Display settings’, then reopen
it and set the option back to 100%.
A final fix is to switch to tablet mode
and back again. Click the icon at the far

Deleting your Google account and

Update Android TV
Q
How do I update my Android TV box
to Lollipop?
Terry Wareing, via email
A
Google doesn’t supply its Android
operating system to the public, so
updates for your device have to come
from the manufacturer. They don’t
always provide them, though, so you
may be stuck with an older version of
Android. Go to Settings, About and
select the option to check for software
updates. If an update is available, your
device will download and install it.

Bring back disappearing icons
Q
I have a 64-bit version of Windows
10, and the icons on my Desktop
sometimes rearrange themselves and
even vanish. I can restore them by using
Explorer to create shortcuts from my

means the same icon appears twice in
the folder – once as the original and
again as a shortcut.
I tried all the recommended solutions
from the web and, when Microsoft
attempted to fix the problem remotely,
their support staff told me it must be
a bug that crops up in some PCs and not

said it might be sorted in the next update.

If you have an AOL account and

Ignore the message and sign into
your AOL account, if you’re not

homepage and click Account info.
Click Edit in the Postcode section
and enter a valid postcode.
If AOL was asking for the
information, it now has what it wants
and the message should no longer
appear. If you still see the message,
you may have some malware installed
on your computer. Run a malware

Hear your writing read back
OneDrive’s website (onedrive.live.com)
lets you run an online version of
Microsoft Word in your browser. It is
almost as good as the PC version and is
certainly adequate for my occasional use.
An interesting tool I have just
discovered is Immersive Reader. Open
or create a Word document on the
OneDrive website, then select Immersive
Reader on the View menu. Click the Play
button at the bottom of the window and
your document will be read out to you.
This is useful for checking that your

GENERAL PC
Make more of Desktops
I find using a laptop is more convenient
than a desktop PC, but the drawback
is the screen size, which is smaller than
a PC monitor. One way to get more from
a laptop’s screen is to use Windows 10’s
multiple Desktops, so you can put each
app on its own screen.
Click the Task View button in the
taskbar (it sits just to the right of the
search box), then click the plus (‘New
desktop’) button on the right-hand side
of the screen to add one or more
Desktops. Press Windows+Ctrl and the
left or right arrow to go from one
Desktop to the next, and you can open
different programs on each one. Click the
Task View button to show all the
Desktops and windows as thumbnails.

GENERAL PC
Stop windows snapping
In Windows 10, when I try to position
a window at the top or side of the
screen, it changes the size and position,
maximising the window or filling half the
screen, and covering all the other
windows. It’s particularly annoying when
I’m trying to move one window out of
the way so that I can see others.
I found the setting to switch this off in
the Settings app. Open Settings and click
System. Select ‘Multi-tasking’ on the left
and turn off Snap on the right.
Alternatively, you can leave Snap on
and turn off some of the individual
options, such as resizing windows, using
the switches below.

TOP TIP
Google may be the most popular
search engine but Bing has some
interesting tools that you may not have
discovered. For example, my kids have
introduced me to Bing image search,
which they use to collect images for

you search for images and save them
at Bing’s website without having to
download them.
Go to www.bing.com and search for

Move the mouse over an image and,
in the bottom-left corner, click the plus

You can now continue browsing and
save more images.

Create custom Windows
toolbars
Toolbars are useful for quick access and
I find the best way to keep a clear
Desktop is to create a toolbar for it.
Right-click the taskbar, select Toolbars
and make sure that Desktop is ticked.
In the toolbar that appears (if it’s not
already there), double-click its double
chevron to show a list of all the items on
your Desktop. You can move your cursor
over folders to
show their
contents and click
files to open
them. If you want
to clear your
Desktop of
clutter, right-click
it, select View and
make sure ‘Show

unticked.
You can create
similar toolbars
for anything you use frequently – just
right-click the taskbar, then choose ‘New
toolbar’ in the Toolbars list and pick the
directory you want a toolbar for. As well
as my Desktop, I’ve got toolbars for
Browsers, Notepad Texts and My

easy access!

Get faster mobile internet
I’ve had a 4G contract with Three for
several years but I’ve noticed that when
I’m in a busy area, especially in a city,
internet speeds leave a lot to be desired.
Even when I have a full signal, I’ve run
speed tests that have revealed download
speeds of less than 1Mbps. When I’ve
complained to the network about this,
they blame it on ‘congestion’ and claim
that they’re making efforts to improve
the service.
In the
meantime, I’ve
discovered a
way to combat
the problem.
By simply
turning off 4G,
your phone
should default
to the next
fastest
connection –
usually 3G or
the H+ band –
which, in my experience, seems to be less
congested and often produces faster
speeds than the 4G connection!
To do this on my Samsung S6, I open
Settings, choose ‘Mobile networks’ and
‘Network mode’. By default, 4G devices
will be set to LTE/3G/2G, or similar,
so select the next option down, which
should be ‘3G/2G’.

Open recent folders in Google
Drive
Last issue, there was an excellent tip
about creating shortcuts to the folders
you access most frequently in Google
Drive. I wanted to point out that there’s
another way you can access recent
folders without having to navigate your
way through a long hierarchy of
directories. I always wished that Google
Drive would include recently used folders
as well as files in its Recent section, but
I’ve just found out it doesn’t need to. Just
right-click a file that’s part of a wider
project you’re working on, select Locate
and it opens the folder that contains it.

Record TV from your phone
BT TV customers: did you know that you
can set recordings on your YouView+ box
remotely with the YouView mobile app
(bit.ly/youview420)? The first time you
launch the app, make sure you’re on the
same network as
the TV box and
you’ll be able to
connect to it. Now,
simply head to the
app’s TV Guide,
select a program
you want to record
and tap the R in
the top-right
corner before
choosing ‘Record
episode’ or
‘Record series’.
This is very useful
if you only realise
after you’ve left
the house that
there’s something
you want to record. It’s an excellent app,
even if you just want to use its TV Guide
and don’t have a YouView box.

For months, I thought there
was something wrong with
Google Maps on my PC.
Whenever I zoomed in
on a particular area, it was
impossible to see the outline
of smaller roads, which made
the app almost unusable.
I tried enabling Lite mode, in
case it was the fault of my
PC’s graphics card or
something similar, but nothing
I tried worked. Then, eventually,
I discovered that I’d caused the
problem myself by turning my
monitor’s contrast up too high. On a
long online thread describing a similar
problem, someone suggested turning
the monitor’s contrast down as a fix.

As soon as I did this, as if by magic,

something less clearly defined, but I’m

use Google Maps properly again.

Q
I used BullGuard (www.bullguard

Am I right in thinking I should go ahead

I have to examine each one to make sure?
Geordie582, Web User Forums
A
The quick answer is no. Different
programs use the same file placed in
different locations, and they won’t work if
that specific file has been deleted. The
same can apply to Windows itself.
To address the sluggishness that you’re
experiencing, you’re better off seeing
what’s going on in Task Manager.
Right-click the taskbar, select Task
Manager and, under the Processes tab,
try sorting the items by CPU and Memory
usage to see what’s hogging your
resources. In Windows 10, you can also
click the Start-up tab and try disabling
any programs that don’t need to be
launched at startup.
Have you checked how much free
space you have on the hard drive?
Instead of deleting duplicates, you should
try using the built-in tool Disk Cleanup to
remove some clutter. Just type its name
into the Start menu and click it to run.
If your PC has been upgraded to
Windows 10 from an older operating
system, there might be a large Windows
folder that you can
delete, which can be as
big as 20GB. There’s
a good article at
How-To Geek (bit.ly/

more guidance.
If you must use
a duplicate finder,

My trials with video-editing
software
Since the demise of Windows Movie
Maker, I have been trying to ﬁnd a free
replacement for my modest video-
editing needs, so I was interested to see
VideoPad recommended in Issue 418’s
Weekend Project (bit.ly/webuser418).
On the face of it, VideoPad appears
to be freeware, but it turns out that the
‘free’ version is actually trialware and
stops working after 14 days. I have no
issue with trialware as such, but I do
think it somewhat underhand when this
is not clearly stated before the download
commences.
My search for a free replacement for
Movie Maker was something of
OpenShot (www.openshot.org). I ﬁnd it
user friendly and it strikes a great
balance between complexity and useful
features. I sincerely thank you for that.

Buﬀering BT puts a bee in
my bonnet
I have a bee currently buzzing around
B
arry Collins makes some
interesting points in his
column in Issue 419 (bit.ly/
webuser419) about Twitter not
being the best way to get
technical support, but I must
respectfully disagree with his
conclusions. Personally, I’ve found
that one of the few things Twitter
is good for is contacting and
actually getting a response from
customer-service personnel.
I’ve often found that emailing a
support address yields nothing
more than an acknowledgement
message, and phoning these people is
a Kafkaesque nightmare of confusing
menu options and endless on-hold
times with dreadful music playing on
repeat. When you ﬁnally do get
through to someone, they’re usually so
tied to their script that any deviation
causes untold confusion.
Twitter can be helpful for tech support
In contrast, when you contact a
company’s customer-support account
through Twitter, you usually get a reply
very quickly because they’re desperate
to avoid a public stream of abuse. Unlike
Barry, I’ve usually found the replies to be
helpful rather than antagonistic, and
I don’t mind continuing the discussion
privately because it allows for messages
of more than 140 characters!
Dealing with customers via
social media can’t be easy and
I feel sorry for the support staff
who have to mop up problems
caused by notoriously unreliable
companies such as TalkTalk.
They are expected to have instant
answers and some customers
can be very rude and impatient.
Of course that doesn’t excuse
unhelpful replies to complaints,
but Barry’s comment that
“waterboarding is too good for
[tech support] people” takes things
a bit far!
I think it’s good that companies use
Twitter and Facebook to deal with
customers face-on instead of hiding
behind frustrating phone systems.
It’s certainly preferable to using social
media to ‘troll’ and harass people.

which involves BT,
Kodi, piracy and
unwanted
advertising. Four
hot topics in one!
BT Sport buffers,
skips and freezes on both my laptops
even though I have BT Inﬁnity and am
using a wired Ethernet connection.
It does this in IE, Firefox and Chrome.
Other broadcasters don’t.
I have checked my download speeds,
as has BT, which has also tested the line
and all is as it should be. I suspect the
number of adverts on the BT Sport site
may be a factor since I noticed buffering
as they refresh, so now I use Adblocker,
which regularly stops 20 to 30 of them.
And, no, it doesn’t run better without
Adblocker. It’s worse without Adblocker.
I read a comment on a forum
wondering why a pirated BT stream runs
better than the ofﬁcial one. This prompts
me to wonder if, having paid BT for a
service that it cannot provide,
you are entitled ethically, if not legally,
to help yourself to such streams.
Alternatively, perhaps BT should
consider releasing an ofﬁcial stream for
Kodi and similar platforms, but I’m not
holding my breath for that. The only
stream BT seems eager to improve is its
income stream. So meanwhile, I’ll keep
complaining and hope BT takes notice.

Watch out for BT hijack
scam
I am emailing you to inform you of
a computer hijack scam in which a man
calls to say that he is a BT engineer and
there is a fault with your hub and they

call back, but this time it’s a woman who
says your hub is full of viruses and every
time you go onto the internet you are
downloading more viruses. She says that
she is the other guy’s boss and she then
tries to get you to give the scammers
remote access to your system to remove
the viruses.
I have already contacted BT and Sky,
as well as the police, but I would greatly

Windows 10 can be very
annoying
Thank you for your advice in Issue 419
about blocking annoying adverts in
Windows 10. I had already worked out
how to get rid of the ones in the Start
menu and on the Lock Screen, but the
stupid pop-ups above
the taskbar were
driving me mad.
Why can’t Microsoft
understand that if
I want to use Chrome
instead of Edge, then
no amount of
nagging is going to make me change my
mind? If it really wants me to switch to
Edge, then perhaps it should offer some
decent extensions for the browser.
As for Cortana, I don’t know why
anyone would ﬁnd it useful. Who needs
a ‘personal assistant’ watching their
every move and constantly interrupting
them with ‘suggestions’? It’s not a useful
feature, it’s just very annoying and I’d be
surprised if anyone actually uses it on
a daily basis.
Don’t get me wrong, I do like Windows
10 but Microsoft has deﬁnitely got a few
things wrong that make it irritating at
times. That said, compared with
Windows 8, which was almost unusable, I
suppose we should count our blessings
that it’s not worse.

Much ado about Facebook

I suspect that your latest edition

to share their day with thousands of

I would be pretty boring most days,
anyway.

Google can’t control YouTube
I am not surprised that companies are
angry about Google placing their adverts
next to extremist videos on YouTube.
It’s been clear to me for a while that
Google has lost control over exactly
what appears on YouTube and that
a lot of the videos
that are uploaded
are offensive and
potentially illegal.
If Google can’t stop
people posting
copyrighted
material then it’s
hardly likely to stop
them posting
hate-ﬁlled and
inﬂammatory rants.
You only need
to look at the
comments below videos to see how
unpleasant many YouTube users are.
Perhaps YouTube has been a victim
of its own success – with so many videos
shared every minute, it’s impossible to
monitor them all. However, you would
think that a company as successful and
powerful as Google would make more
effort to moderate YouTube and react
to complaints more quickly.

a fjord or some other body of water?

Whether that’s a Rolex or a Cartier
watch, nobody’s quite sure, but she can
still afford whatever luxury timepiece
she likes. Because despite losing the
equivalent of the entire population of
China’s account details, despite taking
a $350bn hit on Yahoo’s impending sale
to Verizon and despite (according to
a recent New York Times article, bit.ly/
nyt420) repeatedly
failing to invest
sufficiently in
Yahoo’s security,
Mayer is still set to
escape unscathed.
She takes home
an annual salary of
$28m (about £23m),
and even if Verizon decides to show
her the door when the takeover
is complete, she’ll receive a $23m
severance package. That’s a $50m
reward for what’s described as the single
largest security breach in the history of
the internet. Nice work if you can get it.
Mayer’s not the only big boss picking
up a handsome cheque after a massive
security blunder. Dido Harding recently
announced she was standing down as
Barry Collins wonders when tech company
CEOs will be punished for security breaches
Page 404
the CEO of TalkTalk, 18 months after
tens of thousands of her customers
were relieved of their personal details
by a teenage hacker. You may recall
that Harding spent the first two days
after the attack stumbling around
TV studios, failing to answer the most
basic of questions, such as how many
people had been affected or whether
the customer data was encrypted.
Dido the singer would have made
a more reassuring spokesperson.
TalkTalk’s share price crashed,
more than 100,000 customers walked,
the company’s reputation was trashed
and yet Harding survived. And while
she too waived her £220,000 bonus
and handed it to charity, she also saw
remuneration double to £2.81m and
will be paid her full salary this year,
despite the fact she’s quitting only
two months into the financial year.
The only people who’ve paid a high
price for the tech firms’ sloppy security
are the ones who’ve had their identities
stolen as a result of the breaches.
Don’t be fooled by these bonus
gestures. They’re as empty as the
mansions these fat cats live in.

N
othing makes my rat-snifﬁng
sensors go off more alarmingly

And, boy, have those sensors
been blaring out lately.
Marissa Mayer is the CEO of Yahoo,
the internet equivalent of The Spice
Girls: massive in the Nineties and
incredibly still earning a fortune to
this day, despite last having a hit
20 years ago. Mayer recently decided
to surrender her $14m bonus and
“redistribute” it to her “hardworking
employees”, after her company
belatedly admitted it had suffered
the mother of all security breaches.
In case you missed it, an attack
on Yahoo in 2014 spilled the account
names, email addresses, telephone
numbers, dates of birth, encrypted
passwords and, in some cases,
unencrypted security questions and
answers of 500 million customers. That
came a year after another similar attack,
which yielded personal details of
a staggering one billion customers –
including the
Sky and BT
customers for
whom Yahoo
provided the
email service.
Yahoo
reportedly
noticed both
breaches at the time, but apparently
didn’t realise quite how massive they
were. Only two years later, in 2016, did
the company finally come clean on the
full extent of the damage, forcing
customers to reset their passwords.
If you look up “shutting the stable door”
in the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms,
it simply says “see Yahoo”.
Mayer surrendered her bonus because
the breach happened on her watch.
