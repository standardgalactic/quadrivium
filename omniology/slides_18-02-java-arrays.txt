Java Arrays 
Assume B < A.  What happens in the following? 
 
B[] b = new B[10]; 
A[] a = b; 
 
a[0] = new A(); 
b[0].aMethodNotDeclaredInA();

B < A       if B inherits from A           as in Cool 
C < A       if C < B and B < A                as in Cool 
B[] < A[]  if B < A                         not as in Cool

B[] b = new B[10]; 
A[] a = b; 
a[0] = new A(); 
b[0].aMethodNotDeclaredInA(); 
 
 
 
 
a 
b 
Having multiple aliases to updateable locations with different types is unsound!

• Standard solution 
– Disallow subtyping through arrays 
 
B < A       if B inherits from A 
C < A       if C < B and B < A 
B[] < A[]  if B = A

Java Arrays 
• Java fixes the problem by checking each array assignment 
at runtime for type correctness 
– Is the type of the object being assigned compatible 
with the type of the array? 
 
• Adds overhead on array computations 
 
• But note: arrays of primitive types unaffected 
– Primitive types are not classes
