Preface
Congratulations

Well done for making the fantastic decision to learn the wonderful language of Arabic. For whatever reason it may be, a new challenge,
relocation to an Arabic speaking country or for business, you can rest assured that you have made another great decision in choosing one of the
most successful and smoothest Arabic courses. This book will lead you to push yourself anizeЅd take a step above the rest in a fun and interactive
way.
 
Arabic is considered to be one of the most alive, important and beautiful languages in the world. This book uses an extremely stimulating,
logical and easy way to help you learn from the very beginning. In any language, speaking appears to be the most fundamental aspect for a lot of
people. From the start of the book, you will be introduced to the basics of speaking and pronunciation, using a simple format that allows everyone
to speak Arabic in a natural way. The book will then continue to develop your new skills by enabling you to understand and heighten your ability to
read, listen to and write this amazing language.
 
Arabic is a Semitic language and is the formal and official language of 22 Arab countries. It is also the spoken language of almost 420 million
people living in Arabic and non Arabic countries.
 
This book will teach you the basics of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the modernization of the Classical Arabic structures, as well as
additions from the main dialects spoken all over the Arab world.
 
Variations of the Language
 
Like any other language, spoken Arabic has some dialects with variations and differences. The differences between these dialects are
incomprehensible from one to the other, and can be referred to as five main dialects divided according to their regions.
 
Maghreb
 
The Maghreb dialect is spoken in the region of the Maghreb countries, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Mauritania, and Morocco.
 
Egyptian:
 
The Egyptian dialect is used in Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, and some western parts of Saudi Arabia. It is the most widely understood colloquial
dialect across the Arab world, because almost 93% of Arabic Movies, TV, and Media use the Egyptian dialect.
 
Levantine
 
The Levantine dialect comes from and is used in Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan and Syria.
 
The Gulf
 
The Gulf dialect is spoken in the Arabic Gulf Countries, which are made up by Iraq, Kuwait, most of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United
Arab Emirates, and Oman.
 
Modern Standard Arabic
 
MSA (Modern Standard Arabic) has become the most popular dialect and is now spoken and used by all the Arab countries.
 
The dark countries on the map show the Arab League.
 
Written Arabic

 
Tale Qsize="3"he core of Arabic writing that is used today comes from the classical Arabic which is principally defined as the Arabic used in
the Qur'an and in the earliest form of literature from the Arabian Peninsula.
 
Two Important Facts
 
The First is that, any language has a vast wealth of vocabulary, but do we need to learn that vast amount to be able to communicate in a
language?
 
Of course not! Just, 20% of the words in a language make up to 80% of the conversations we face in our daily life. You may not be speaking
like a native immediately, but you'll have a solid base and the ability to keep improving and developing yourself. This method is suitable for
everyone from frequent travelers to first timers, as well as language students and enthusiasts.
 
So, this book focuses on the vital 20% that will help you speak Arabic interactively and dynamically.
 
The second point and this is a really exciting fact. The Arabic language uses word roots, for example, we can take one root like (KTB) from the
word (KaTaBa) which means "he wrote" and from there conjugate all Arabic verbs tense. Nouns can also be made from the same root because
they have a relation with it.
 
KaaTeB= writer, KeTaab= book, maKTaB= office,
 
maKTaBa= library, ma KToob = letter & written, and more.
 
Arabic grammar is fairly simple compared to Western languages, but the language itself has richness in its vocabulary that exceeds most
languages in the Western world.
 
Below is the Arabic alphabet and key to show you how to pronounce them. Try to read paying attention to the pronunciation.

Culture Notes:
 
The most common greeting in Arabic is the phrase "as-salaamu Aalaykum" which means literally "may peace be upon you". And the most
comm ol a"1">wa Aalaykum as-salaam", which means literally "and upon you peace".

 
But as you see in the above phrases, to learn a language, you have to learn its culture, because literal or direct translation doesn't make sense
when you speak that language.
 
The same thing in "SabaaH el-khayr" = good morning, and the response of it, which is "Sabaah en-nuur" while "nuur" means literally " light",
but this is the way how Arabs greet each others, simply means: if you greet me using good words, so I have to greet you using better words!.
 
Also there is no specific word for greeting in the afternoon. You can use simply either "as-salaamu Aalaykum" at anytime, or "masaa' el-khayr"
for the afternoon as well.
 
Vocabulary Practice
 
Exercise 1: Answer the following questions:
 
1- You walk into a classroom in an Arab country, what is the first thing that you can say?
 
 
2- What would be expected in response?
 
 
3- How do you say "Good morning"? What is the response for it?
 
 
4- How do you say "Good Evening"? What is the response for it?
 
 
5- How do you say "Good afternoon"? What is the response for it?
 
 
6- How do you say "Good night"? What would be expected in response?
 
 
7- How would you say "How are you doing"? How would you answer?
 
 
Exercise 2: Match each word in (A) with an appropriate word in (B) to make a phrase or a sentence. Go from right to left:
 

Exercise 3: Write down the Arabic meaning of the below words:
 
1- Hello, good night, and, How, today, the daytime.
 
 
2- Welcome, Morning, Good.
 
 
3- How are you today?
 
 
4- I'm fine. Thanks.
 
 
5- Good evening!
 
 
6- Peace be upon you.
 
 
7- Good afternoon.
 
 
Grammar usage
 
1- Verb "to be" in Arabic:
 
In Arabic, there is no direct translation of "to be" in the present tense. That means that "am & is & are" will not show in an Arabic sentence. For
example:
 

2-Definite and Indefinite articles:
 
There are no indefinite articles (a/an) in Arabic. For example; "SabaaH" means (morning) and (a morning), and "masaa'" means (evening) and
(an evening).
 
Arabic has a definite article as "the" in English. It is "al", in Arabic, which added to the beginning of a word by attaching the prefix "al-". For
example; "al-masaa'" means (the evening), "al-Haal" means (the condition).
 
There is one other important rule to keep in mind when it comes to the definite article "al".
 
Remember the phrases "as-salaam" and "an-nuur". As the "as" in "as-salaam<="0 a>" and the "an" in "an-nuur" means "the" as well, But as
you can see how they are pronounced differently from "al".
 
That's because there are few letters in Arabic when they come after the definite article "al" so they can cancel the pronunciation of the "l" sound
in "al" and that time you will find only the "a" followed by those mentioned letters doubled, as in "as-salaam" with double "s" and "an-nuur" with
double "n".
 
Those letters called "sun letters" because the word "shams" in Arabic which means "sun" begins with one of them.
 
How to know those letters? Simply they are the ones which we use the tip of the tongue to pronounce them: "t , th , d , dh , r , z , sh , s, l, n".
Fourteen of the Arabic alphabets:
 
The other14 letters which don't force "l" in "al" to be silent are called "moon letters" because the word "moon = qamar" in Arabic begins with
one of them. Here is the example for both cases:
 
"SabaaH" = a morning, "aS-SabaaH" = the morning. "masaa'" = an evening, "al-masaa'" = the evening. "shams" = sun, "ash-shams" = the
sun. "qamar" = moon, "al-qamar" = the moon.
 
(You will find more explaining the reading course in this book).
 
3-Gender:
 
Arabic is a language that has gender, like Spanish, French, and Italian. That means every noun is either masculine or feminine.
 
Nouns in Arabic if they have the sound (a) at the end, or what's called in Arabic (taa' marbuuta), so they are generally or 90% feminine, and
masculine if they end in anything else. Examples:
 
"rajul": man (masculine), "mar'a": woman (feminine), "ketaab": book (masculine), "Taawila": table (feminine), "qalam": pen (masculine), "say-
yaara": car (feminine)
 
Keep in mind that not all feminine nouns end in with this sign.
 
Examples:
 
"bent": girl (f), "ukht": sister (f), also some objects like: "shams": sun (f), "'arD": earth (f). But this type of feminine gender is very rare in Arabic.

Grammar Exercises
 
It is always better to do an exercise for anything new you learn. So if you feel that you are not yet ready to do it, so it is better to get back and
read the grammar notes again.
 
Exercise 4: Change these indefinite nouns into definite ones, using the appropriate form of the article (al). Then translate them into
English: Remember the rule of the sun letters:
 

Exercise 5: Circle the feminine nouns in the below words:

Grammar notes:
 
By now you are able to recognize a lot of from what you have seen at the previous lesson. Remember the very common greeting phrase in
Arabic "marHaban" and "'ahlan wa sahlan" these are the friendly greetings that Majed and Adam used.
 
To ask someone: "What's your name?" simply say: "maa esmuka?" to a man, or "maa esmuke?" to a woman. Word by word: "maa" means:
(what) and (your) is a possessive pronoun, which consists of (you = 'anta or 'ante) with adding of "ka or ke" to give the meaning of "esmuka" for a
man or "esmuke" for a woman. Remember that Arabic doesn't express (is, are, or am) and there are two forms of you: "'anta" to a man and "'anti"
to a woman.
 
The response for this question is: "my (possessive pronoun) + name"="0 qalaamesm + ii".
 
How to ask: "Where are you from?" simply say "men 'ayn 'anta" to a man as we mentioned above or "ante" to a woman.
 
There are other different forms for speaking to two people or to three or more, but do not worry about that for now!
 
At the end of the dialogue you have learned how to speak friendly to any one and how you can use a useful phrase like "nice to meet you", which
means "furSa saAiida" or "tashar-rafna".
 
1- The possessive adjective

 
Where are you from?
 
The title refers to a type of adjective formed by adding a suffix (yy) for masculine, or (y-ya) for feminine nouns.
 
- To form these types of adjective from a place or noun, follow these steps;
 
1- Remove the article if the noun has (al) as in the example of (Iraq) above.
 
2- Remove any (alif, taa' marbuuta) from the end of the nouns.
 
3- Add the suffix (yy) to make the adjective for male, or (y-ya) to make it for female. See the next table;
 
2-Subject pronouns:
 
Arabic is like English. It has two sets of personal pronouns: subject and possessive pronouns. There is some overlap among these sets.
However, Arabic has more pronouns than English (Formal Arabic has separate categories for masculine and feminine and dual pronouns for sets
of two, these are not used in most varieties of spoken Arabic). Here you will learn the following most commonly used subject pronouns in spoken
Arabic:
 

3- Question words.
 
To ask a question in Arabic, use one of the below words at the beginning of a sentence:
 
Examples:
 

Exercises
Exercise1: Answer the following questions:
 
1-What would you say at the end when you meet someone for the first time and you get to greet him?
 
 
2-What would be expected in response?
 
 
3-How do you say "what is your name?" and what is the response for it?
 
 
4-How do you say "Where are you from?" and what is the response for it?
 
 
Exercise 2: Match each question in (A) with an appropriate answer in (B):
 
Exercise 3: Identify the nationality of the following personal pronouns. The country name is given in the brackets:
 

Exercise 4: Translate into Arabic:
 
1- Where are you from?

What's this?

Demonstratives
 
The demonstratives "haTha / haThehe" are the two used words to point in the phrases like "this is a/an...." and "this..."
 
Look at the below examples and learn how to say "this is a" & "this is the":
 
1- This is a / an.... (Pointing to a masculine)
 
2- This is a / an....(Pointing to a feminine)
 
1- This.... (Pointing to a masculine)
 

2- This.... (Pointing to a feminine)
 
Useful adjectives:
 
(m) is abbreviation for (masculine) & (f) is abbreviation for (feminine). You can see that the basic rule in the Arabic language is to put " " "taa
marbuuta" to the masculine noun or adjective to make it feminine.
 

 
Grammar notice
 
1- Simple Sentences
 
Many Arabic sentences do not need the verb "to be" (am, is, are) in the present tense, which means that you can have a (nominal sentence)
without verbs at all. Look at the below phrases;
 

2- Noun-Adjective phrases:
 
It is simple to form an adjective phrases in Arabic, because (The adjective follows the noun), as in the below example.
 
As you see in the two examples, if the noun has a definite article (al) also the adjective must be with (al), and vice versa.
 
Remember that, if the first word or the noun is definite or with (al) and the second word is not definite, so; it will be considered a full nominal
sentence as in the grammar notice number 1. Example;
 
Exercise 1: Translate into Arabic:
 
1- The house is wide.
 
 
2-fy" T eM The city is beautiful.
 
 
3- This is an office.
 
 
4- This chair is small.
 
 
5- This table is long.
 
 
6- This is an old school.
 

 
7- Hamdan is Qatari and Ahmad is Emarati.
 
 
8- They are from Kuwait.
 
 
9- This is a new book.
 
 
10- This is a tall girl, and this is a small boy.
 
 
Exercise 2: Translate into English:
 
Exercise 3: Combine the following pairs of words to make a useful nominal sentence or noun-adjective phrase as in number one.
 

3- The Plural
 
al-jamA 
 
Arabic has three types of plurals:
 
1- Masculine plural
 
The noun takes one of pair endings 
according to grammatical function, which you will learn in the intermediate levels. While in spoken Arabic they use only one of the above suffixes,
which is "iin". For example:

Culture Notes
 
Arabs usually assume that the family values have to be shared among all members of the society in general. The extended family plays more
important role in Arab society than in the Western society. They visit each other always or often on social occasions if they live in the same city. But
many people also feel that this general habit has decreased in recent years.

Grammar usage
 
Saying (to have) in Arabic
 
You have noticed Adam in the dialogue when he said (Aendii muHaaDara)= I have lecture. The pronoun forms which he used with the
preposition are basically the same like the possessive pronouns forms which mentioned in the previous lesson. The following table introduces
these endings with prepositions indicating the meaning of (to have) in Arabic.
 
Three of these combinations form (to have) in Arabic. The difference in how they are used to express possession is:
 
- (lii) is used when referring to owning people: (lii 'akh) = I have a brother
 
- (Aend) is used when referring to owning objects: (Aendii say-yaara) = I have a car
 
- (maAa) is used for referring to owning something right now: (maAii dollar)= I have a dollar. While some Arabic speakers use (Aend) for all
cases.
 
Exercise 2: Use the below prepositions and pronouns which are given in the brackets to express relationships of possession, association, and
accompaniment among humans and/or objects:
 

Negation of (to have)
 
You can use
 to negate (to have) in Arabic, whatever the subject is. See the following examples:
 
Exercise 3: Translate into Arabic:
 
1-I don't have any Emirati money.
 
 
2-We don't have a car.
 
 
3- Sarah doesn't have a lecture tomorrow.
 
 
4- They don't have an Arabic book.
 
 
5- Don't you have work today?
 
 
2- Feminine Plural
 
Most of the nouns which refer to feminine take the ending 
 
For example:

 
all1
3- Broken Plural
 
Arabic has more than ten patterns of the broken plural which you will learn in intermediate level, as in some English words "child / children, man /
men, and woman / women". For example:
 
Exercise 1: give the plural for the below feminine words:
 
Exercise 2: Guess and underline the correct plural for the below nouns, note that, some of the plurals you see them at first time, so; you need to
figure out the right ones to learn, as you know already the difference between the feminine and the masculine nouns. First one is already answered.

Language Notes:
 
Most of Arabic speakers use an expression to say "me also / as well" not as in standard Arabic, they say "wa 'anaa kamaa 'an", as "kamaa
'an" "
" means as well in spoken Arabic.
 
Grammar usage
 
az-zaman elHaaDer 
 
The Present Tense
 
You have seen Adam says ('a'kul = I eat – 'ashrab= I drink – 'adrus= I study)
 
These words are Arabic Verbs in present tense. As if you said: (I eat) it's equal to (I am eating) in Arabic. Also ( 'ashrab) it means: (I drink/or: I
am drinking). As Arabic has just one present tense.
 
In Arabic; the verb itself has the subject. As it's expressed in a prefix = (letter at the beginning)/ or a prefix and a suffix = (lettev hh"0" alh="0"
ainking). Ar at the end).
 
This means that, all verbs in the Arabic language are regular! You don't need to change the root of the verb at any tense (past, present and
future).
 
So, to express (I eat/ or I'm eating): ('anaa 'a'kul), you can simply say: ('a'kul) without a pronoun, as the verb itself tells about it.
 
The below table lists the full conjugation of the present tense for verb; (to live).
 

You can see in the table that, there are two forms for the verb with the pronouns (you for a female, you for plural and they). A form with the ending
(uu) and the other one with (uun), both of them have a grammatical usage in formal Arabic, which you will learn about in the intermediate level.
While most of Arabic speakers use the ones with (uu) at the end, many gulf Arabs use the form with the ending (uun). The following tables show
conjugations of some verbs.
 


Negation of the Present
 
To negate the present tense we have learned, just use the particle " Ø§"-"Laa" before the verb. For example, to say (I don't eat, don't drink, I
don't study).
 
Exercise 1 : Choose the correct answer:
 
Exercise 2: Translate into Arabic:
 
1- Where do you live?
 
 
2-I study and live in the United Arab of Emirates.
 
 
3- I like to drink coffee in the morning
 

 
4- Do you want to order now?
 
 
5- Do you like Arabic food?
 
 
6- She doesn't like tea.
 
 
7- In this restaurant, we eat beautiful Arabic dishes.
 
 
8- I like Arabic language.
 
 
9-The students don't want to study hard (well = jay-yedan 
).
 
 
10- We don't want to eat now.
 
 
Exercise 3: Conjugate the following verbs with the subject pronouns.
 
Use the following tables to conjugate:

Vocabulary:
 

Look at the picture and learn these words:
 
The below table shows the Arabic numbers from Zero to Ten
 
The numerals used in English are of Arabic origin, but Arabs nowadays use the Hindi ones sometimes, because of business ties with India in
past.
 

Days of the week are mostly driven from numbers as per the following table.
 
As you see the above table shows the Arabized months from the Latin ones. Also there are the Arabic months which used for the Islamic

calendar. Thos months depend on the lunar calendar.
 
Arabic ordinal numbers can be easily distinguished from the numbers used in counting. The table below includes the numbers first to twelve;
they are presented together with the definite article. This is the form used in telling the time.
 
Grammar usage
 
1-Please note that the number has got to have the same gender as the noun! As below:
 
Arabic has a dual form which is used by adding 
 to the noun (Taaleb / Taalebaan or Taalebain) 
 & the same thing with the
feminine nouns by adding 
 with just one more thing the (Taa Marbuuta) at the end of the feminine noun
 becomes (taa maftuha) 
 before adding the suffixes 
 as in the above examples.
 
2- when you count from 3 to 10, use the plural for the counted nouns. For example: thalaath say-yaraat, Aashar say-yaaraat
 
 
But after (10) use the singular nouns again, even for billions. For example:
 
Ahada Aashar say-yaara, melyuun say-yaara 
 
Learn these words:
 

What is the time?
 
 
Kam es-saaAa?
 
The ordinal numbers are used in formal Arabic to tell the time. For example, if it is 1:15, you simply say in Arabic, "al-waaHeda wa rubuA"
 
And "wa thuluth" for 1:20, and "wa neSf" for 1:30, and "ethnain 'el-laa thuluth" for 1:40, and "ethnain 'el-laa rubuA" for 1:45.

Culture Notes:
 
Like most of the cultures all over the world, it is a common practise in Arabic Culture that when you want to ask someone about something you
start the conversation by saying excuse me(Aafwan) 
 , also if you want to ask somebody for his /or her permission before asking something,
before leaving or finishing the conversation, you can say 
/ baAd iThnak/ik)= excuse me, as it's considered rude to leave in without saying
anything.

IDaafa
 
Possession
 
One of the essential structures of Arabic is (IDaafa) which consists of two or more nouns are put together to make a possession. For example:
 
1- Remember that (IDaafa) equal in English when you say (in literal translation) :
 
2-Just the last word in (IDaafa) can take the article (al) or a passive suffix, like;
 
 
3-For IDaafa in spoken Arabic you can observe the (Ta' marbuuta ) which is the last letter and we pronounce it as (a) is pronounced as normal
taa' as in:

 al-maaDii
 
Past tense
 
You have seen a few verbs in the above story that express the past tense in Arabic. Note that (al-maaDii = past) in Arabic is conjugated with
suffixes. Make it a habit to learn both present and past tense together. The following chart shows the conjugation of the past tense using the verb (to
go):
 

To conjugate the verb (kaan 
)= (he was) remember that it has two stems in conjugation as most of the verbs with the letter (alif) in the
middle, they're called (weak verbs). One stem with (alif) for the third persons, and the other one is without (alif)
 
Negation of the past
 
You have learned to negate the present with (laa). To negate the past tense in formal Arabic use (maa + the verb in past). For example: maa
kaan = was not = 
, maa Thahaba = didn't go = 
 

Language Notes
 
You have seen that a few forms with a certain pronouns in the above charts for ('anaa, 'anta, huwa, hum) have the suffix written in the
transliteration in between brackets, that's to help you to observe that in spoken Arabic most of the Arabic speakers don't pronounce these vowels.
For example: they say (Thahab) not (Thahaba), and (Thahabt) not (Thahabtu) without the last vowel.
 
Exercise 1: Conjugate the verbs in the below charts:
 

 

 
lema / lemaTha?
 
Why?
 
There are four words / phrases to answer the question, "lema? / lemaTha? = why?" in Arabic, or to give information about a reason, each one of
them has its grammatical usage:
 
 
be-sabab
 
On account of / because of
 
Example:
 
 
laa uHebb haTha sh-shaareA be-sabab ez-zeHaam.
 
I don't like this street because of the crowd.
 
 
Aala sha'n / men sha'n
 
For the sake of / because of
 
like the previous word, but used more in spoken languageamong Arabs, with a lightly fast pronunciation as one word" alashaan" or "menshaan".
 
Example:
 

 
men faDlek, laa tusreA bes-say-yaara Aala sha'n el-' awlaad.
 
Please, don't speed up the car, because of the children.
 
 
le'an-na
 
Because
 
Example:
 
 
aTh-hab elaal maktab baakeran, le'an-na baytii qarib jed-dan.
 
I go to the office early, because my house is so close.
 
 
Le
 
In order to / for
 
Examples:
 
 
uHebb' an ushaahed et-telfeziuum let-tasleya
 
I like to watch the TV for entertainment.
 
 
'adrus l-lughaat le-'atakal-lam maAa n-naas men Hawl al-Aaalam.

Culture notes
 
The new society of Arabs still holds close to traditional values and morals. Loyalty to the family has always, and continues to be the top
priority of the Arab. Religion is also a main focus in how they live their lives.
 
One of the most important values in Arabic culture is generousity, which means a lot for Arabs. Even for poor people, as they love to give
whatever they have, to be generous as much as possible, and of course not everybody is the same, but that's a general moral all over the
Arab's world.
 
Grammar usage
 
The most common way to ask (how many? How much?) is to use the interrogative particle "kam" 
 .
 
To ask about the numbers just use 
 "kam" ? and use a singular noun after (kam). Marked with the suffix (an)(tanween fat-ha) in formal
Arabic.
 
Example:
 

 
There's a simple way to ask about the price, just use the word (bekam?) 
 which mean = (how much?) for example:
 
Note that the answer will be preceded by the preposition 
 "Be" if it's number or currency , Examples:
 
Exercise 1: Translate into Arabic:
 
1- How much is the coffee?
 
 
2- How many km it is from your work to your home?
 
 
3- How many days in a week?

5- How many weeks in a month?
 
 
6- How many hours in a day?

Culture Notes
 
It is very common in Arabic culture to say the phrase (in shaa' Allah 
 ) when you talk about something that you are going to do
in the future, and it is almost like when you say (hopefully) in English.
 
Grammar usage
 
The Future Tense.
 
Expressing the future tense in the Arabic language very simple, as you can just add the prefix 
 (sa) or the word
 (sawfa) before the verb in present tense which means (will) You can use 
 (sa) for the near future and 
 (sawfa) for the far future:
 
Negating the future tense
 
For negating the future tense, you can use just the particle (lan) "
"=(will not) before the present tense. For example:
 

Exercise 1: Conjugate the below verbs in the future tense:

Culture Notes
 
Who are Arabs?
 
- Linguistically, the word "Arab" means deserts and waste barren land well- nigh waterless and treeless. Ever since the dawn of history, the
Arabian Peninsula and its people have been called as such.
 
- Over 350 million Arabs world wide
 
- To be an Arab, is not to come from a particular race. It's a culture trait rather than racial. Any person who adopts the Arabic language as
his mother tongue is typically called an Arab
< wi ad your hiv heightp height="16" width="0" align="justify">- Arab world includes Muslims, Christians and Jews
 
- Arabic is the original language of the Holy Qur'an (The Islamic holy book)
 
The Arab world stretches from Morocco across Northern Africa to the Gulf and is known as the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). It can
also be defined as countries where Arabic is the dominant language.
 
Arabs are the most recent of all Semitic peoples according to their appearance in history. In fact, it is not possible to speak about Arabs in
ancient times, but only about their ancestors. Most of the Middle East is now formed by conventionally called "Arab countries"
 
Consequently, it is helpful to present a brief historical account of the peoples that originally inhabited the Middle East in ancient times, and
which of those peoples generated the Arabs.
 
In order to make this research more comprehensible, we can divide the Ancient Middle East into three main regions:
 
1) The "Fertile Crescent" and neighbouring lands, from the Zagros Mounts in the east to the Ararat in the north and the Mediterranean
shores in the west (Mesopotamia, Ararat, Syria-Canaan)
 
2) Egypt: The ancient Egyptians were Semitic Assyrians tribes have been involved with the origin of the Ishmaelite Arabs after sometimes.
This made a result of a foreign invasion performed in the Middle Ages, when the Arabs made of Egypt the outpost for the conquest of Africa
and Mediterranean Sea. Egypt is mentioned four times in the holy Qur'an.
 
3 ) The Arabian Peninsula: the query consists in establishing how much Semitic these peoples were and up to what amount the
Ishmaelite have contributed to the formation of the Arab identity.
 
The Arabian Peninsula is enclosed in the west by the Red Sea and Sinai, in the east by the Arabian Gulf, in the south by the Arabian Sea,
which is an extension of the Indian Ocean, and in the north by old Syria and part of Iraq. The area is estimated between a million and a million
and a quarter square miles.
 
Thanks to its geographical position, the peninsula has always maintained great importance.. Considering its internal setting, it is mostly
deserts and sandy places, which has rendered it inaccessible to foreigners and invaders, and allowed its people complete liberty and
independence through the ages, despite the presence of two neighbouring great empires.
 
Its external setting, on the other hand, caused it to be the centre of the old world and provided it with sea and land links with most nations at
the time. Thanks to this strategic position the Arabian Peninsula had become the centre for trade, culture, religion and art.
 
Today, Arab countries are religiously and ethnically diverse with Islam being the dominant religion in most countries.
 
Importance of the Arab world
 
 
 
22 countries make up together the A" agether rab league, which located in the middle of the world
 
 
Location of the beginning of the three main world religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism)
 
 
Close to 70% of earth's oil reserves which at the Arabian Peninsula and north Africa
 
 
Saudi Arabia and Iraq possess the world's largest reserves of oil
 

 
Common Misconceptions
 
 
 
All Arabs are Muslims, and all Muslims are Arab.
Arabs are a religiously diverse group – significant numbers of Arab Christians are in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, and Iraq.
Arabs make up between 18-20% only of the Muslims populations in the world.
 
 
Muslim women are oppressed and forced to wear the hijab.
Women often see it as empowering because they are not viewed as sexual objects but judged by their character.
Muslim advocacy groups point out that four out of the five countries with the largest Muslim populations although they are not Arab
countries— Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey — have had female heads of state, something the United States cannot claim
 
 
The Arab world is one big desert.
 
 
Truly geographically complex and diverse, but can you spot a Camel or a tent in these photos?!
 
Arab Contribution to History
 
For generations, the lore of "One Thousand and One Nights" helped shape Western notions about Arabs culture. The collection of tales
described an exotic world of harems and flying carpets, Sinbad and monsters, Aladdin and the jinn, Ali Baba and the 40 thieves. But there are
few other things were more important than Arabian Nights tales.
 
The discoveries made by men and women in Muslim civilization have left their mark on the way we live today. An organization called 1001
Inventions has uncovered a thousand years of science and technology that had a huge but hidden impact on the modern world.

Did you know that Camera, Algebra, and Alchemy are originally Arabic words?!?
 
The camera is not a modern invention! It was invented around a thousand years ago by Muslim Arab scientist. His name is Abu Ali al-Hasan
Ibn al-Haitham.
 
Ibn alHaitham did a great deal of revolutionary and influential work on optics through the meticulous experimentation and evidence
collection, creative explaining and thorough recording. He was most likely the first to prove that light travels in straight lines, and that we see
things when light reflects off an object and enters the eye. Ibn al-Haitham's 'Book of Optics had a profound impact on the work of Bacon
(13thcentury) and Davinci (15thcentury). (Book Reference: Vision and Cameras,)
 
Ibn al-Haitham on Iraqi currency
 
Ibn al-Haitham who is well known by the name (Hazen) in western books was a 10th century scientist who revolutionized optics.
 
Born in Basra, Iraq, he spent his adult life in Cairo, Egypt. His most influential achievement was his Book of optics, which formed the
foundations for the science of optics.
 
He rejected the Greek theory that an invisible light emitting from the eye caused sight, instead rightly stating that vision was caused by light
reflecting off an object and entering the eye. By using a darkroom with a pinhole on one side and a white sheet on the other, he provided the
evidence for his theory. He called this the 'Qamra' which means in Arabic the (dark lightning room), and it was the world's first camera.
(Reference: 1001 Inventions website)
 
Algebra was invented by the Muslim mathematician Al-Khwarizmi in the book he wrote in 820. Algebra is the Arabic word (aljabr) for
"equation," and the word "algorithm" comes from the author's name, Al-Khwarizmi. He is rightly known as "the father of Algebra."
 
The word "algebra" is named after the Arabic word "al-jabr" from the title of the book [al-Kitāb al-mukhtaSar fī Hisāb al-ğabr wa-l-
muqābala' , (The book of Summary Concerning Calculating by Transposition and Reduction), a book written by the Muslim mathematician,
Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī in 820.
 
The word Al-Jabr means "reunion. In fact, many ancient civilizations developed some sort of algebraic methods of solving problems, as far
back as the Babylonians, Diaphanous of Alexandria and the Indian mathematicians such as Brahmagupta, but Al-Khwarizmi is considered by
many to be the "father of algebra" because some of his techniques on solving quadratic equations are still in use today. He was the first to
solve equations using general methods. He solved the linear indeterminate equations, quadratic equations, second order indeterminate
equations and equations with multiple variables.
 

Al-khawarizmi on a stamp
 
It was one of the most significant advances made by Arabic mathematics began at this time with the work of a0" he workl-Khwarizmi,
namely the beginnings of algebra. It is important to understand just how significant this new idea was. It was a revolutionary move away from

mathematics to be applied to itself in a way, which had not happened in the past.
