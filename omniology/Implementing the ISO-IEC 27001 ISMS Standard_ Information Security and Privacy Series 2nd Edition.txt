Information security is a global issue affecting international trading, elec­
tronic commerce, mobile communications, social media and the various 
systems and services that make our digital world and national infrastruc­
tures. Managing information security is an even more critical issue, as it 
involves using and managing the policies, procedures, processes, control 
measures and supporting applications, services and technologies that are 
needed to protect the information that organisations, governments, con­
sumers and citizens rely on to carry out their business and to live their 
lives. Information security management needs to be effective, suitable and 
appropriate if it is to protect information from the risks that business and 
society faces in this digital age. For example, processing information is es­
sential for those systems and services we rely on to provide transportation, 
telecommunications, health care, the supply of sources of energy (such as 
electricity, water and gas) and many other common things we accept as be­
ing there when we want them. The information systems that provide vital 
management support for these different aspects of this public infrastructure 
are vulnerable to a wide range of information security risks.
Our dependency on digital information is all pervasive, as are the risks 
to this information. Information could be disclosed and accessible to unau­
thorized users, corrupted or modified either in some unauthorised or ac­
cidental way, or lost or unavailable due to a system failure. There are three 
important security objectives mentioned here—protecting the confidential­
ity, integrity and availability of information. Understanding what the risks 
are and assessing how these risks affect and impact business in terms of 
these objectives is central to being able to manage these risks effectively. 
Introduction

xvi 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
An organisation needs to assess its risks in terms of the potential impact 
that a security incident might have on its business and the likelihood of this 
security incident occurring. It needs to adopt an approach to risk assessment 
that is effective, suitable and appropriate to its business. The simple message 
to all organisations and governments is that investing in the management of 
information security risk is wise. 
All organisations are dependent more than ever on information and 
ICT for driving their business processes, productivity and efficiency, and 
so the need to protect this information is vital to their survival in today’s 
digitally driven economy. Assuring the confidentiality, integrity and avail­
ability of this information, as well as protecting personal data, is at the core 
of business success.
This book covers some of the important international standards on in­
formation security that will help organisations to protect their information. 
These standards (the so-called ISO/IEC 27000 ISMS Series) were developed 
over a number of years to meet the needs of business and commercial mar­
kets and to protect their information, and to prosper in today’s dynamic 
business world.
This book covers what is contained in these standards as well as practi­
cal advice on their implementation. A number of use cases are provided 
to illustrate the use of these standards in business situations. In particular, 
it includes what is involved in establishing and designing, implementing 
and deploying, monitoring and reviewing, and updating and improving 
an information security management system (ISMS). Through the use of a 
well-tried tested process model that is embedded in ISO/IEC 27001, the key 
ISMS standard enables a business to establish an effective information secu­
rity regime and risk management process and to deploy a number of man­
agement controls to continually improve the ISMS to ensure that they still 
have effective information security. The process of third-party certification 
is covered, which enables business to demonstrate through independent 
audits that they have in place an information security management system 
that effectively protects their information. 
The author of this book cannot be held legally responsible or in any way 
liable for the real world use, application, implementation, or interpertation 
of the information given in this book. Users and readers alone are wholly 
responsible for the correct use, application, implementation, or interperta­
tion of the information given in this book.
Finally, the spellings of words used in this book are the internationally 
accepted spellings adopted and used in ISO and ISO/IEC standards and are

1.1  The Importance of Being Informed
Do nothing secretly; for time sees and hears all things, and 
discloses all. 
—Accredited to Socrates
Historically information1 has always played an 
important role, from ancient times to the pres­
ent day. For example: 

 Its use in the military campaigns of Al­
exander III of Macedon, Xerxes, Julius 
Caesar and others; its use in managing the 
societies and cultures of ancient Greece, 
Egypt, Persia and China and across ancient 
cultures and its use to help the Phoeni­
cians, Greeks, Persians and Romans trade 
across their empires; 

 Its role shaping our views and thoughts of 
the world through progressing our knowl­
edge and understanding of mathematics, 
science, medicine and philosophy from 
ancient times to the modern era;


 The silk and spice routes, involving countries in Europe and the near, 
middle and far east, trade and navigation of the Renaissance mer­
chants and seafarers all were dependent on the availability and accu­
racy of information;

 The invention of the printing press brought information to many, and 
the telegraph system got information to others faster across vast dis­
tances, through to its use in the UK coding-breaking machines such as 
Colossus and the German encoding machines such as Enigma; 

 And, finally, to the twenty-first century with its cyber warfare, Big 
Data technology, Internet of Things (I0T), cloud, smart cities/infra­
structure, social media and personally identifiable information (PII). 
The list of examples on the use and importance of information is as 
endless as history itself. Today, we say we live in a global “information soci­
ety” that is constantly expanding and shaping the way we think, work, act 
and play. 
Information from ancient times to now (and for the future) has and will 
continue to be a valuable item to possess, and so it has always been and will 
continue to be the target of risk:

 Risks to a person’s information (e.g., disclosure and theft of informa­
tion about his personal estate and affairs, his health, his discoveries 
and inventions, modifications of his plans, loss or corruption of his 
personal data that protects image and reputation), 

 Risks from information used by his opponents (e.g., a competitor 
knows more than he does, traders in the Renaissance times knew a 
better trading route without getting lost or falling foul of rocks and 
uncharted waters,2 Sun Tzu’s Art of War and business strategy);

 Risks from sharing information with others (e.g. a partnership—busi­
ness contracts, friendship—or social media). 
The very same market innovations, products and services that have 
shaped this digital world we are a part of and the benefits we have gained 
2.	 The Spanish and Portuguese explorers and seafarers used notion of risk in the sixteenth 
and sevententh centuries to refer to sailing into uncharted waters. This use of risk is associ­
ated with a notion of uncertainty related to space. We then adopted a notion of risk related 
to time, as used in financial processing and investment. In this later case, it is related to the 
probable consequences of investment decisions for borrowers and lenders. Today the no­
tion of risk relates to a wide range of other space/time situations of uncertainty, including 
risks to our organisations’ financial and nonfinancial assets.

from this digital world have also given us a world where the information we 
use, value and rely on is at risk and is becoming more and more difficult to 
protect. The importance and value of information and protecting this value 
is the central theme of this book. 
1.2  Globally Connected
Thought is an idea in transit, which when once released, never can be lured 
back, nor the spoken word recalled. Nor ever the overt act be erased. 
—Accredited to Pythagoras
Today’s so-called information society, digital economy, digital agenda or 
whatever other name we might choose to describe the phenomena that is 
dominating our world is increasingly driving, shaping and reforming the 
way we work, live and play. Organisations around the world are doing busi­
ness across public and private networks. Every type of business, from the 
very small to the very big, is affected by the information society. Citizens 
in many countries of the world are connecting to the Internet doing online 
shopping, banking and hotel and airline reservations. Industry and govern­
ments alike are seeing the benefits of going down an electronic commerce 
route and reaping the benefits of the digital economy. 
Today’s technologies make it easier to have access to information, to 
store more of it, to process it faster and to communicate it globally in sec­
onds. Mobile and smart technologies make it easier to stay globally connect­
ed all the time, and the exponential growth in mobile apps is transform­
ing our lives like never before, enabling us to do more on the move. This 
capability gives us the means of being more informed and more capable of 
exploiting and taking advantage of a vast range of business and private op­
portunities. But the same technology can at the same time be used to dam­
age or destroy information.
With the emergence of the IoT, users via not just laptops, mobile and 
smart devices, but many billions of small sensors and other devices connect­
ed through wireless networks have also connected to the Internet, making 
the size of the Internet community bigger. These things are, for example, 
helping to control smart energy, transport and building systems and so are 
collectively involved in sensing, communicating and in a limited way pro­
cessing information—which may be critical, sensitive or even personal. 
The diverse range of network technologies and services available today 
make it easy to access the world, to be globally connected and to be online 
at any time, from almost anywhere. This makes information more vulner­
able, whether it is business, government, personnel or private information.

Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
The email to a friend or business colleague once sent is public—it can be 
deleted by the receiver, but it cannot be recalled. Remarks on a social media 
site can become viral within a short period of time. The power of the Inter­
net and global interconnectivity has given many benefits to our work and 
our life styles—it has also made many of things we do more public and less 
private, and it has raised the need for more awareness, care and attention 
to how we should use this global connectivity and how we should behave 
in a responsible, safe and secure way.
1.3  More Ado About Risks 
As a rule, men worry more about what they can’t see than about what they can. 
—Accredited to Julius Caesar
Risk is about the effect of uncertainty on objectives, so says ISO 31000. 
What is the uncertainty of whether your organisation is going to be in­
fected by a malware attack? If it happens what is the effect on the organisa­
tion’s security objectives—maybe information will be stolen by competitors, 
which will have a financial impact on the organisation, or maybe informa­
tion is modified or destroyed and the impact is loss of productivity whilst 
the information is restored. 
Organisations’ dependency, use and application of information are all 
pervasive—all IT-based business processes are driven by the supply of in­
formation, and the output of this process is yet again information. This de­
pendency on information is made more urgent by the potential risks to 
this information and the uncertainty of the risk. Understanding what the 
information security risks are and assessing how these risks have an effect 
and impact business are vital to being able to manage these risks effectively. 
An organisation needs to assess its risks in terms of the impacts result­
ing from a security incident happening. It needs to adopt an approach to 
risk assessment that is suitable to its business environment, and to invest 
in the management of risk and to minimize any business impact. The risk 
management process needs to minimize the risks (effects of downside risks) by 
making well-informed decisions of how to treat the risks in the most cost-
effective manner whilst taking account of the need to support and maxi­
mize the business opportunities (opportunities through upside risks). The risk 
management process involves taking the necessary action to ensure that the 
options to treat the risks are implemented whilst supporting the business 
opportunities. 
It is important that an organisation deals with information security 
at all levels to ensure availability and continuity of business resources, to

treat the risks to avoid or reduce any potential damage and impact to the 
business. 
1.4  Decoding the Secret of Information Security Management
The secret of change is to focus all your energy, not on fighting the old but on 
building the new.
—Accredited to Socrates
Management systems like the information security management system 
(ISMS) involve cycles of continued improvement to deal with changes and 
to maintain a level of effectiveness suitable and appropriate to the organisa­
tion and its business. The ISMS ethos is about keeping up to date to make 
improvements and treat the risks associated with changes.
Uncertainty and change are inevitable, inescapable and universal as­
pects of life and the world we live in. Whether in business or personal life, 
there are uncertainties and there are changes—“nothing is as permanent 
as change.”3 The definition of risk as discussed in Chapter 2 centres around 
the notion of uncertainty, and all changes (expected or unexpected) carry 
an element of risk. Information security risks threaten the digital world we 
live in and as this digital world evolves and changes the risks change and 
evolve. As businesses and consumers engage in this digital world, they need 
to confront the uncertainties of the risks that are involved. The “secret” of 
information security management systems lies in the continual improve­
ment processes involved, which enable businesses to manage the changes 
and risks and keep up to date with their risk treatment programme—apply­
ing effective security process and controls to protect their information. This 
means preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of informa­
tion by managing the risks. These three security objectives should be the 
focal point of the organisation’s information security policy. In addition, 
the organisation needs to take care of the personal data, or PII (person­
ally identifiable information), it processes relating to its staff, customers and 
consumers. The ISMS that the organisation implements needs to continu­
ally evolve and improve with the pace of change to achieve these objectives. 
The digital revolution as a way of doing business has been growing by 
leaps and bounds, and it has become the standard way of doing business. 
Technologies such as the cloud, Big Data and IoT are making our world more 
connected, smart and risky. Standards, such as the ISO/IEC 27001 family, 
provide a means of managing the information security risks in our cyber 
world. This family of standards if properly implemented can give support to

addressing questions such as “Is my organisation (are my trading partners) 
fit to do online business in a secure way?” or, for assurance associated with 
publicly available systems, “Is my organisation’s online site secure?” 
Other questions involve confidence in third party arrangements: “Are 
they fit to have access to my organisation’s information processing facilities 
and to share information with?” or “Are they fit to look after my organisa­
tion’s information and information processing facilities?”
1.5  Management and Awareness 
Education is kindling the flame not filling the vessel.
—Accredited to Socrates
The emphasis of ISO/IEC 27001 is the protection of information and what 
underpins the success of having an effective, suitable and appropriate ISMS 
implementation is management. This entails the scope of management in its 
broadest sense—from the CEO and others in the C-suite category through 
to other layers of management, it involves the management of people, pol­
icy, procedures, processes and systems of risk management controls and 
information, and to be a comprehensive framework for managing informa­
tion security it also includes the management of everything that supports 
the business—the services, business applications and IT.
Management is the heart and soul of a successful ISMS implementa­
tion. Direction needs to driven by top management policy, there needs to 
be active commitment and leadership for the ISMS and this needs to come 
from the top. Resources need to be made available and committed to from 
the top of the organisation. Management needs to engender and promote 
an information security culture in the organisation to support its use of its 
ISMS.
Awareness and education is critical to having an ISMS that will be ef­
fective in managing the risks. Using the organisation’s ISMS in practice, day 
by day, week by week, as part of managers’ and employees’ work function 
is important. Awareness and education should, in this sense, be about the 
practice of using the ISMS, not about the theory of the ISMS. For manag­
ers and employees, it should be about using and applying the ISMS policies 
and procedures to their particular work circumstances. What should they 
do, and how should they respond to security events as they happen? What 
is the proper way to secure information they handle? Do they know which 
procedure to use for a particular work task that involves some security as­
pect? These and many other day-to-day practical aspects of carrying out 
their specific job function in a manner that will protect the information they 
are dealing with is at the heart of good information security awareness. So 

1.6  Legislation, Regulation and Governance 
7
it is not just about building up one’s knowledge, but understanding how 
to put this knowledge into practice, knowing how to do things in practice 
and knowing how to react and respond to information security risks. This 
practical understanding might make the difference between the organisa­
tion successfully surviving a malicious attack or suffering untold damage 
because of this attack. 
Information security is teamwork, and everybody plays an important 
role in managing the risks—from the CEO down to employees should all be 
aware of their responsibilities and what they need to do and to contribute 
toward achieving an effective ISMS.  
1.6  Legislation, Regulation and Governance
Good people don’t need laws to tell them how to act responsibly . . .and bad people 
will find a way round the laws.
—Accredited to Plato
Over the past three decades or so, more and more attention has been given 
to legislation, and regulation in various areas are related to some aspect of 
information (e.g., data protection and privacy legislation, computer misuse 
and hacking, social media, electronic commerce and the use of electronic 
signatures, digital evidence or cyber security). It is very likely that the future 
will see more and more such regulations appear. 
Laws and regulations have a business impact on any organisation—
they clearly need to comply with such legislation and demonstrate their 
compliance to such legislation.
The growth in online business has further increased the need for legal 
protection to protect businesses and their transactions as well as PII that is 
stored and processed by servers in different jurisdictions. 
Some examples of current legislation include the following:

 SoX or Sarbox (Sarbanes Oxley) also known as the Public Company 
Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 (US)

 Cyber security–related regulations in the US include the 1986 Com­
puter Fraud and Abuse Act, the 1996 Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
(GLBA), the 2002 Homeland Security Act and the 2013 Cyber Intel­
ligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA); the UK Computer Misuse 
Act criminalises unauthorised access to computer systems;

 The EU Directive on Data Protection (plus the legislation of each 
Member State—their national interpretation of the EU Directive) cov­

ers the gathering, handling and exchange of personal data; there is 
data protection/data privacy legislation in non-EU countries including 
Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nor­
way, Republic of South Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland;

 The EU Directive on Electronic Signatures (plus the Member States in­
terpretation) provides legal provisions regarding the legal admissibility 
of electronic signatures (e.g., those used for online transactions) and 
other similar pieces of legislation appear in other parts of the world 
such as in Hong Kong and Japan;

 International copyright and licensing laws provide legal measures 
against piracy and theft of intellectual property.
1.7  En Route to a Certified Business Environment 
We acquire a particular quality by acting in a particular way.
—Accredited to Aristotle
The quality of our  information security depends the actions we take to 
achieve an effective ISMS. In more than 100 countries around the world, 
organisations are using ISO/IEC 27001 to manage their information securi­
ty by implementing an ISMS. In addition, many of these organisations have 
opted to have their ISMS certified by a third-�party certification body. This 
certification process against ISO/IEC 27001 provides a common interna­
tional benchmark for assessing an organisation’s information security man­
agement system. Certification reassures management, customers, suppliers 
and business partners that an organisation is applying best information se­
curity practice. It opens up new avenues of business based on a protected 
business environment. 
ISO/IEC 27001 and the process of certification (see the accredited cer­
tification standard ISO/IEC 27006 for more details) provides a tried and 
tested framework, a metric system for determining whether your business 
is “fit for purpose” from an information security management perspective. 
The certification audit will check that the ISMS if in conformance with the 
requirements in ISO/IEC 27001. The audit team will ask many questions 
and seek evidence to check conformance.

1.7.1  Processes

 In the planning, designing and development of the ISMS have you 
taken account the requirements and expectations of all interested par­
ties and any issues (internal or external) that might be relevant?

 Do you have an effective and systematic risk assessment process in 
place? Have you implemented an appropriate set of controls to treat 
the identified, assessed, and evaluated risks?

 Do you have effective, adequate, and suitable management processes 
in place to govern and manage the ISMS?

 What processes do you have in place to check, assess and verify the 
performance of your implemented ISMS?

 Do you have a continual improvement process in place? Does this ad­
equately manage and effectively adapt to changing circumstances that 
are relevant to the ISMS?
1.7.2  Controls

 Do you have an information security policy? Do you have all the nec­
essary procedures in place? Are they sufficient? 

 Are your employees aware of and trained in security for the organisa­
tion in general and their job in particular?

  What controls and measures are in place to handle information se­
curely? How are you controlling access to your sensitive and critical 
commercial information? Do you protect the integrity and availability 
of your business information and processes?

 Have you the controls and procedures in place to securely use, man­
age and monitor your operations, networks and communications?

2.1.1  Overview
The work in International Standards Organi­
sation (ISO) and International Electrical Com­
mittee (IEC) is carried out by Technical Com­
mittees (TCs) and Subcommittees (SCs). These 
committees are responsible for the executive 
decision-making and overall management of 
the standards programme. In addition Working 
Groups are established in the SCs to carry out 
the development of the standards. The Joint 
Technical Committee (JTC 1) is a joint ISO and 
IEC committee responsible for IT-related stan­
dards. For more detailed information about the 
standardisation process; who gets involved in 
the work; the technical committees and what 
they do and the deliverables (standards, techni­
cal report), the reader is directed to the ISO web 
site at www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_devel­
opment.htm. 
This chapter provides an overview of the 
work in ISO/IEC JTC 1 related to information 
and IT security standardization, and in particu­
lar information security management system 
standards and the subcommittee SC 27.

2.1.2  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27
2.1.2.1  SC27 Structure
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 is the committee responsible for a wide range of infor­
mation and IT security standards projects. The subcommittee consists five 
working groups (WG 1–WG 5) covering a diverse ranges of information and 
IT security subjects. Figure 2.1 shows the current structure of SC27. The SC 
27 working group WG 1 is particularly responsible for the ISMS ISO/IEC 
27001 family of standards. 
2.1.2.2  SC27 Membership 
The membership of SC 27 currently includes national standard bodies rep­
resenting 50 different countries. These are voting members in addition to 
national standard bodies representing 20 different countries, which are are 
observing members (nonvoting). 
SC 27 also works in cooperation with many other organisations, nor­
mally referred to liaison bodies, in order to facilitate the exchange of in­
formation on future needs for security standards as well as engaging in 
collaborative work on the development of the committee’s standardization 
projects. The liaison body may be another committee within ISO, IEC or JTC 
1, or an organisation outside of the ISO and IEC committee structure. This 
might be another international standards  organisation, such as ITU-T, or a 
regional standards body such as the European Telecommunications Stan­
dards Institute (ETSI), or it may be an organisation representing an indus­
try sector, consumer group or user association. Currently (as of September 
2015), SC 27 has 71 national body members (these are the national stan­
dards  organisations from 71 different countries) and more than 55 liaison 
members (these are liaison organisations that also contribute to the work). 
The large number of members of SC 27 means a wealth of contributions, 
knowledge, expertise and skills of professionals in the field of information 
security is available from around the globe. This also means the needs and 
expectations of organisations and businesses working in most market sec­
tors contribute to the development of the final product. This wealth of in­
put, as well as the review and feedback of contributions, adds to the value 
of the standards developed.   
2.2  Overview
2.2.1  International Standards
The ISO/IEC 27001 family of information security management system 
(ISMS) standards is developed at the international level in response to mar­
ket needs. Like all ISO and IEC, they are based on global expert opinion and 

2.2  Overview

Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
developed through a multistakeholder process, using a consensus-based 
approach. All such standards go through a maintenance life cycle to keep 
them current and up to date—this means that standards are often revised 
after a period of time, normally about five years. Therefore, a standard may 
have many editions, as each new edition replaces the previous edition. Us­
ers of ISO/IEC standards should always check if the version they are using 
is the most current edition. Users of ISO/IEC standards should, therefore, 
always check if the version they are using is the most current edition, as 
revised versions are likely to be developed over time.
This book addresses the requirements of the second edition of ISO/IEC 
27001. All the other members of the ISO/IEC 27001 family that are quoted 
are the current versions at the time of writing this book. These versions may 
be replaced with new editions in the fullness of time, including the second 
edition of ISO/IEC 27001. 
2.2.2  The 27001 ISMS Family
This chapter presents details of the current series of information security 
management system (ISMS) standards called the ISO/IEC 27001 family: 
2.2.2.1  ISMS Requirements
ISO/IEC 27001: Information security management system requirements: 
This is the core standard in the ISO/IEC 27001 family. This standard speci­
fies the requirements for establishing, implementing, deploying, monitor­
ing, reviewing, maintaining, updating and improving information security 
management systems (ISMS).
2.2.2.2  ISMS Supporting Guidelines and Code of Practice

 ISO/IEC 27002: Code of practice for information security manage­
ment;

 ISO/IEC 27003: ISMS implementation guidelines;

 ISO/IEC 27004: Information security management measurements;

 ISO/IEC 27005: Information security risk management.
This group of standards in the ISMS family provides advice, guidance 
and implementation to support for the purposes of meeting the require­
ments in ISO/IEC 27001. 

2.2  Overview 
15
2.2.2.3  ISMS Accredited Certification and Auditing Standards

 ISO/IEC 27006: International accreditation guidelines for the accredi­
tation of bodies operating certification/registration of information 
security management systems;

 ISO/IEC 27007: Guidelines for information security management sys­
tems auditing;

 ISO/IEC 27008: Guidelines for auditors on ISMS controls;

 ISO/IEC 27009: Sector-specific application of ISO/IEC 27001—re­
quirements; 

 ISO/IEC 27021: Competence requirements information security man­
agement professionals.
This group of standards covers requirements for third-party accredited 
ISMS certification audits (ISO/IEC 27006), audit guidelines covering first, 
second and third party audits (ISO/IEC 27007) and a technical report giv­
ing guidance for assessing the implementation of ISMS controls selected 
through a risk-based approach for information security management (ISO/
IEC 27008). The group also includes a standard (ISO/IEC 27009) that focus­
es on sector specific application of ISO/IEC 27001. Finally, a new departure 
is a standard (ISO/IEC 27021) that deals with competence requirements to 
support certification schemes dealing with the certification of information 
security management professionals. 
2.2.2.4  ISMS Sector Specific

 ISO/IEC 27010: Information security management for intersector and 
interorganisational communications; 

 ISO/IEC 27011: Information security management guidelines for tel­
ecommunications organisations based on ISO/IEC 27002;

 ISO/IEC 27013: Guidelines on the integrated implementation of ISO/
IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1;

 ISO/IEC 27015: Information security management guidelines for 
financial services;

 ISO/IEC 27017: Guidelines on information security controls for the 
use of cloud computing services based on ISO/IEC 27002; 

16 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 ISO/IEC 27018: Code of practice for PII protection in public clouds act­
ing as PII processors;

 ISO/IEC 27019: Information security management guidelines based 
on ISO/IEC 27002 for process control systems specific to the energy 
utility industry.
This group of standards covers sector-specific application of ISO/IEC 
27001 and ISO/IEC 27002. This includes defining sector-specific controls 
and requirements in addition to those defined in ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/
IEC 27002, as well as providing additional implementation guidance for 
sectors where necessary. 
2.2.2.5  ISMS Family Support

 ISO/IEC 27000: ISMS overview and vocabulary;

 ISO/IEC 27023: Mapping revised editions of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/
IEC 27002;

 ISO/IEC 27014: Governance of information security;

 ISO/IEC 27016: Information security management—organisational 
economics.
This final group covers a miscellaneous set of subjects: a standard that 
covers the main items of terminology used in the ISMS family together with 
an overview of the family. This standard considers the governance aspects of 
information security (ISO/IEC 27014) through which organisations direct 
and control the information security management system (ISMS) process as 
specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and a technical report that covers the important, 
but often forgotten, topic of economics of information security (ISO/IEC 
27016). This provides guidelines on how an organisation can make deci­
sions to protect information and understand the economic consequences 
of these decisions in the context of competing requirements for resources. 
ISO/IEC 27023 provides a set of maps, which show the transition from the 
2005 to the 2013 editions of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002.
2.2.3  Standards Interrelated to 27001 ISMS Family
A number of additional standards are not included in the family listed in 
3.1.2. They are nevertheless related to the ISO/IEC 27001 family. Many 

2.2  Overview

In addition to the standards mentioned in Section 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, SC 
27 develops many other standards (e.g., in the field of cryptographic tech­
niques, standards for security evaluation criteria for products and systems 
of products and standards for identity management and privacy manage­
ment). Figure 2.2 shows a high-�level view of the range of standards devel­
oped in SC 27 arranged to reflect how they relate to ISO/IEC 27001.

2.3  Evolution of the ISO/IEC 27000 Family
2.3.1  The Weakest Link
Managing information security from a people, policy, procedural and busi­
ness process point of view is the core objective behind approach taken in the 
ISO/IEC 27000 family of ISMS standards. Although we are highly depen­
dent on technology and the role it plays in today’s business environment 
as our information-processing workhorse, this is just one aspect and IT se­
curity is not the most significant challenge to be faced. People themselves 
are probably present the major problem to information security. People are 
the greatest of all vulnerabilities, and the management of people and the 
processing of information presents the greatest of challenges. People are risk 
takers when it comes to a range of everyday tasks they are involved in, and 
at the same time they are risk averse in other tasks they perform. Training, 
investing and motivating people, as well as allocating responsibilities for 
security and making them feel that they are part of a security culture, are 
some of the key parts of establishing an effective awareness and manage­
ment system that will help businesses protect their information. Recogni­
tion of the significance that people, procedures and processes are the great­
est problems to resolve in the domain of information started to grow in the 
late 1980s but did not become a serious topic of standardization until the 
mid-1990s, and certainly it was not until the 2005 onwards that it started to 
become an universal agenda item on management review and board-level 
meetings. 
2.3.2  Baseline Controls
Best practice controls have been the essential element of information secu­
rity management and the prehistory of the ISO/IEC 27000 of ISMS stan­
dards, going back as far as the late 1980s when it really started to become 
of age. More and more use of controls commonly used by business was 
brought together: controls that business could employ without the need 
to undertake any costly commitment. Businesses could set a level of pro­
tection across their organisation using these “common use” best practice 
controls to establish a “baseline” level of security as a common security 
standard. In addition, of course, businesses had to build upon this baseline 
where security controls dealing with specific risks were necessary. 
Catalogues of baseline controls were produced in many business sectors 
and user groups such as the International Information Integrity Institute 
(I4). The I4 work adopted those controls in common use by industry as per 
the criterion “if the majority of organisations uses a specific security control, 
then it is defined as control in ‘common use’” and is thus a baseline control.

20 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
In the early 1990s, the UK, in the Department of Trade and Industry 
(DTI), set up an industry group to establish a code of practice: a code de­
veloped by industry, for industry. This code was a catalogue of best practice 
security controls, including some of the baseline controls discussed and ad­
opted by industry in the 1980s. However, this code went one step further 
introducing the notion of risk assessment as a way of matching the controls 
to the business value of the information and information system of each 
organisation. This code would thus allow organisations to customize their 
information security to the needs of their business: specific information sys­
tems they are using, their business processes and applications, and their 
trading and operational environment. This DTI code also included advice 
and guidance on the implementation of the controls. This code was pub­
lished in 1992 by the DTI.
The idea of applying a risk assessment was also introduced into the code 
as a management tool for establishing the security requirements of the busi­
ness and for selecting a set of controls to match these requirements. 
2.3.3  Formative Years—BS 7799 Part 1 and Part 2
In 1995 the DTI code of practice was published as a British Standard BS 
7799: 1995. In 1998 it was decide to carry out a review of the 1995 version 
to check whether there was a need to revise it or to leave it as is: this is nor­
mal practice with all standards. This led to a decision to revise the standard 
to improve and update it whilst retaining backward compatibility with the 
1995 version. An editing team under the management of the BSI commit­
tee BDD3 set about reviewing and collecting comments from a range of 
interested parties.
From 1998 onwards, a family of BS 7799 standards was then progressed:

 BS 7799 Part 1 of this family was the DTI code of practice for informa­
tion security management;

 BS 7799 Part 2 is a specification for an ISMS. This development arose 
after a public consultation on the need for a third party certification 
scheme for ISMS. The certification and audit process model used for 
BS 7799 Part 2 is the same as that used for ISO 9001 for quality and 
ISO 14000 for environmental management systems.
The emergence of the second part of the standard BS 7799 marked a 
second significant milestone in information security management. The idea 
of applying a risk assessment, although mentioned in Part 1, is specifically 
introduced in Part 2 as a mandatory requirement as a means of establishing 

2.3  Evolution of the ISO/IEC 27000 Family 
21
the security requirements of the business and for selecting a set of controls 
to match these requirements. 
Organisations could establish and implement an ISMS based on Part 2 
and subsequently went for third party certification of their ISMS to demon­
strate that their information security was “fit for purpose.” Such certifica­
tion provides a means for measuring the effectiveness of the ISMS giving 
assurance to their customers, business investors, shareholders and trading 
partners.
The family of BS 7799 provides best practice suitable for organisations, 
whether small, medium or large and in every market sector, including gov­
ernment and commercial organisations. They give organisations best prac­
tice for use in various trading relationships including customer-supplier 
chains, collaborative ventures, third-party services, outsourcing arrange­
ments and virtual private networks of organisations distributed around the 
world, as well as the emergence of global B2B electronic commerce and as 
G2B, G2C and B2C relationships. 
2.3.4  Internationalization
Up until 2000 these standards were being used worldwide by many dif­
ferent industries and businesses, and they became de facto international 
standards from an industry perspective. The next stage in the development 
of these standards was to formalize them as international standards. This 
led in 2000 to the proposed introduction of BS 7799 Part 1 into ISO/IEC 
JTC 1.1 The proposed introduction into ISO/IEC achieved the minimum 
majority support (67%) to be approved. Since not all member countries of 
JTC 1 gave a vote of approval, and it is always good to achieve a consensus, 
it was decided after some debate that Part 1 would be published under the 
condition that an early revision of the standard should commence as soon 
as possible. So in 2000 BS 7799 Part 1 became ISO/IEC 17799:2000. 
In 2005 a revised version of ISO/IEC 17799:2000 was published and 
in the same year BS 7799 Part 2 became ISO/IEC 27001: 2005. Also in the 
same year, SC 27/WG 1 adopted the ISO/IEC 27000 numbering scheme, 
and the ISO/IEC 27000 family of ISMS standards was adopted.
Today, the international community is now adopting the ISO/IEC 27000 
family as the common language for information security. This enables or­
ganisations worldwide to engage in securing their business using such a lan­
guage to demonstrate to their customers and business partners that they are 
fit for purpose to handle information in a secure way, whether it be online 
business or offline business. The world is now opening up to this notion of a

common ISMS language for the benefit of all organisations to manage their 
risks and to protect one of their critical assets—information.
2.4  Overview of ISO/IEC 27001: 2013
2.4.1  Introduction 
The international standard ISO/IEC 27001 is an ISMS set of requirements 
for establishing, implementing, deploying, monitoring, reviewing, main­
taining, updating and improving a documented ISMS with respect to an 
organisation’s overall business risks and opportunities.
It belongs to a class of standards referred to as the Management Sys­
tem Standards (MSS), which includes standards such as ISO 9001(Quality 
Management System), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System), 
ISO 22000 (Food Safety Management System), ISO/IEC 20000-1 (Service 
Management System) and ISO 22301 (Business Continuity Management 
System). 
In 2012, ISO published a common approach (ISO Directions Annex SL, 
Appendix 3) for both the development of new MSS and for the revision of 
existing MSS. The reasons for this were to enable an organisation to oper­
ate an integrated MSS that will comply with the requirements of two or 
more MSS. For example, an organisation could decide to operate with both 
ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 22301, which would mean they would integrate 
their ISMS with the BCMS. Using this common integrated approach would 
provide many business benefits and increase the value of using MSS. Both 
ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 22301 are two standards from the MSS family of 
standards that have been revised to take on this common approach, which 
involves using a high-level structure, identical core text and common terms 
and core definitions.
The second edition of ISO/IEC 27001 was published in 2013 following 
a three-and-a-half year revision cycle. This new version takes account the 
new MSS approach. This means that the high-level structure of the chap­
ters, clauses and sections looks different than the 2005 edition. In addition 
to changing the high-level structure, changes were made to the require­
ments specified in the standard. These changes reflected the contributions 
received from member bodies of SC 27 and their cooperating organisations. 
ISO/IEC 27023 is a guide that provides transition maps showing the high-
level changes that have been made between the 2005 and the 2013 editions 
of both ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002. This guide is very useful for 
those wanting to know in more detail where the changes have occurred. 
This section of Chapter 2 provides some of the highlights of the second 
edition of ISO/IEC 27001. More specific discussion on the second edition 

2.4  Overview of ISO/IEC 27001: 2013 
23
can be found in later chapters. These subsequent chapters will cover the 
changes in more detail.
2.4.2  ISMS Audience
The organisational target audience of ISO/IEC 27001 has not changed in 
the 2013 edition: it is suitable to all types and sizes of organisations. It can 
be applied to any type of business activity and across all business markets, 
since its subject matter is the protection of information, irrespective of what 
systems, processes or IT the organisation deploys.
The functional target audience in the 2013 edition has also not changed. 
The second edition of ISO/IEC 27001 places more emphasis on the role of 
management, leadership and commitment of management in supporting 
the ISMS. There is more emphasis on the need to align the development of 
the ISMS with the needs and expectations of stakeholders and all relevant 
interested parties, and to make sure all internal and external business issues 
and requirements are covered.
2.4.3  Mandatory Statements
The second edition of ISO/IEC 27001 still uses the word “shall” in specifying 
the requirements, and in ISO terminology any requirement that includes 
this word is mandatory to implement if an organisation wishes to claim 
conformance with the standard. Therefore, this means that this standard 
can be used for formal third-party certification, which is similar to the ISO 
9001 case for quality management systems. 
2.4.4  Processes 
The ISO/IEC 27001: 2005 was based on a Plan-Do-Check-Act process mod­
el. In the 2013 edition of ISO/IEC 27001 this model has been excluded, 
although its continual improvement philosophy is certainly still firmly in 
place. The process-based approach, however, is still very much a part of the 
new edition of ISO/IEC 27001, as was the case with the old edition. For 
example, the organisation needs to have a risk assessment process to be 
implemented or risk assessment process or an internal audit process. ISMS 
processes are the systematic operations and activities that are a central fea­
ture of ISO/IEC 27001.
2.4.5  ISMS Stages
The ISMS stages are establishing, implementing, deploying, monitoring, re­
viewing, maintaining, updating and improving and the organisation needs 

24 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
to go through a number of staged activities. These stages include a number 
of shall requirements (mandatory requirements) where things need to be 
done, activities need to be carried out and processes need to be implement­
ed. These requirements fall under the following clause headings: 

 The context of the organisation (Clause 4);

 Leadership (Clause 5);

 Planning (Clause 6);

 Support (Clause 7);

 Operation (Clause 8);

 Performance evaluation (Clause 9);

 Improvement (Clause 10).
2.4.6  Risk-Based Approach
The purpose of the risk-based approach is to take care of the information 
security aspects of the organisation’s business activities. The ISMS risk man­
agement process needs to take into account the requirements and expecta­
tions of all interested parties, including customers, consumers and business 
partners. It needs to take into account any issues that might be relevant 
to information security risks, be they related to corporate governance, le­
gal, regulatory and contractual obligations, business objectives and strategy, 
business operations and processes or the use and application of information 
and communications technology (ICT) systems. 
�The overall risk philosophy in the new addition is based on the con­
cepts and terminology defined in the generic risk standard ISO 31000. The 
clauses in this chapter are a mere overview of the more detailed discussion 
on ISMS risk management found in Chapter 4.
�Both in ISO/IEC 27001: 2005 and ISO/IEC 27001: 2013, risk manage­
ment is a central theme; however, the 2013 edition includes a number of 
important changes to the risk management process. 
2.4.6.1  Risk Assessment
One of the significant changes in requirements between the 2005 and 2013 
editions is the need to identify the assets, threats and vulnerabilities. This is 
no longer a requirement in the second edition. So the asset-based approach 
in 2005 has been replaced with an approach based on the model defined 
in ISO 31000. This current risk assessment will be discussed in Chapter 4.

2.5  Second Edition of ISO/IEC 27002  
25
2.4.6.2  Risk Treatment
Another change to be found in the second edition is related to the treatment 
of risk. In the 2005 edition Annex A was used to select an appropriate set 
of controls from to reduce identified risks. In the 2013 edition the user de­
termines a set of controls in accordance with the risk treatment options that 
the organisation has decided to implement. The organisation then needs 
to compare this set of controls with the Annex A controls to benchmark 
whether any important controls have been excluded.  
The standard ISO/IEC 27005 provides guidance on the information se­
curity risk management in support of ISO/IEC 27001.
2.4.7  Performance Evaluation
In the 2005 version of ISO/IEC 27001, performance evaluation was consid­
ered and implemented through the use of several processes including taking 
measurements, monitoring, internal audits and management reviews. In 
the 2013 edition these same processes are specified and invoked; however, 
they have been brought together in a single chapter and the wording of the 
content has undergone some improvements. The standard ISO/IEC 27004 
provides guidance on the requirements information security measurements 
given in ISO/IEC 27001. 
2.5  Second Edition of ISO/IEC 27002 
At the same time that ISO/IEC 27001 was being revised, so was the stan­
dard ISO/IEC 27002 code of practice for information security management 
being revised. The revised versions of these standards were released at the 
same time.
 The changes to ISO/IEC 27002 included the deletion of some controls, 
the addition of some new controls and the modification of controls from the 
prevision edition. ISO/IEC 27023 is a guide that provides transition maps 
showing the high-level changes that have been made between the 2005 
and the 2013 editions of ISO/IEC 27002. 
2.5.1  Conformance with ISO/IEC 27002
The term “conformance” is often misunderstood and sometimes confused 
and used interchangeably with the word “compliance.” The code of practice 
ISO/IEC 27002 takes the form of guidance and recommendations, as such, 
it is not a conformance assessment standard, using the ISO technical use of 
the term in the sense of a management system standard, as it uses “should” 

26 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
statements, unlike ISO/IEC 27001, which uses “shall” statements. Care 
needs to be taken to ensure that claims of conformance are not misleading.
2.5.2  Applying ISO/IEC 27002
ISO/IEC 27002 is primarily a catalogue of best practice controls, which users 
can select from to deploy security management controls in their business 
environment to achieve a baseline of best practice protection. When com­
bined with ISO/IEC 27001, these two complement each other, providing or­
ganisations with a set of tools for managing information security risks (see 
Chapter 4 for the change in how Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001 is now used).
Of course, ISO/IEC 27002 can be used on its own, but this is outside 
the management system risk-based processes specified in ISO/IEC 27001, 
which are there to facilitate the management of an effective information 
security system with a built-in programme for continually improving an 
organisation’s security status. Subsequent chapters in the book will provide 
more detailed information on the use, implementation and application of 
the ISO/IEC 27002.

3.1  Organisational Context
3.1.1  Understanding the Business
Before embarking on the development and 
implementation of an ISMS, it is important to 
understand your organisation, its context and 
purpose, its organisational structure and how it 
works and operates. This includes consideration 
of the issues, both internal and external, that 
are relevant to the organisation’s purpose and 
business objectives and that could influence the 
ISMS outcomes that the organisation intends to 
achieve. One important factor in this respect is 
the issues that could pose an information se­
curity risk to the organisation’s business objec­
tives, purpose, information and information 
systems. It is also important to understand the 
organisation’s risk culture and appetite in order 
to properly design, implement and integrate the 
ISMS within the organisation. 
For the ISMS to be effective, appropriate 
and suitable to meet the organisation’s objec­
tives and purpose, it needs to determine the 

28 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard 
risks and opportunities. To achieve an accurate measure of what these risks 
are, the relevant internal and external issues and the requirement to be ad­
dressed in Section 3.1.2 needs to be identified and considered. This means 
for the ISMS to effectively manage these risks its design and implementa­
tion shall take account of these issues, relevant information security re­
quirements and be “at one,” in harmony, in sync with the context and busi­
ness environment of the organisation. We shall in Chapter 4 address the 
requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 regarding risk management. 
Understanding the business and its context is essential to enable the 
ISMS to work with and be embedded in the organisation and not function 
as a separate entity. This is important since the ISMS should be a business 
enabler, adding value to the business and minimizing the information secu­
rity risks to help maximize its business opportunities. 
3.1.2  Internal Issues and Context
All those internal issues and dependencies relevant to the purpose and ob­
jectives of the organisation achieving an effective ISMS need to be identi­
fied and taken into account. For example, the organisation needs to ask and 
consider if there may be internal standards, policies and procedures related 
to business processes or the management of operations and resources that 
are relevant. These may be issues, restrictions and dependencies that the 
ISMS needs to take into account when considering the information security 
risks and the implementation of controls for treating these risks. For ex­
ample, restrictions on the type of technology that can be deployed because 
of internal procurement policy or a dependency from another department 
or business unit for a specific support or resource. 
There may be internal IT infrastructure issues that may impact ISMS 
performance and effectiveness; again, these issues need to be taken into ac­
count in the ISMS risk assessment and treatment. The organisation may op­
erate with internal service contracts between business units, and these may 
specify service delivery and availability issues and dependencies that the 
ISMS would need to address. There may be specific issues related to the in­
ternal workforce regarding organisation culture, dependencies on capabili­
ties and competence of individuals for specific roles and awareness issues.
Understanding the internal environment is especially relevant in order 
to appropriately address the ISMS risks. There are internal issues and de­
pendencies that have an impact on the implementation of the ISMS but also 
the ISMS itself will have a direct impact on business operations. Therefore, 
the better informed we are of what issues and dependencies are involved in 
the organisation’s working environment and their effect on implementing 
an ISMS, the better the risk assessment and the better the decision making 

3.1  Organisational Context 
29
will be at arriving at the most effective way to treat the risks. Good risk 
decision making, the type and level of risk control needed and the cost and 
benefits of implementing these controls depends on good information be­
ing available and duly considered during the risk management process. Of 
course, this also applies to the external business environment in which the 
organisation operates. 
3.1.3  External Issues and Context
All those external issues and dependencies relevant to the purpose and ob­
jectives of the organisation’s ISMS need also to be identified and taken into 
account. This includes the following areas of risk and business dependency:

 External organisations relationships:

 Customers, clients, consumers;

 Business partners;

 Supply chains;

 Service providers;

 IT vendors.

 External business processes;

 External resources:

 Connections;

 External workforce;

 infrastructure elements.

 Market conditions and competition;

 New laws and regulations;

 Environment.
Dependency on outside resources, services and infrastructure can all 
have a negative impact on the organisation if, for example, there is an inci­
dent that causes disruption to the supply of these resources and services or 
results in damage to the infrastructure. Failures or interruptions, for exam­
ple, in energy supply, telecommunication services or transportation services 
can have a major impact on organisations. 
Those organisations supplying such resources and services are of course 
responsible for managing their own information and IT security risks. It is, 
however, the responsibility of the organisation availing itself such external 
resources and services to identify external risks in order to be able to ap­
propriately manage their own business risks. This is why it is important to 

30 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard 
understand the organisation’s activities, operations and processes and to 
identify the external issues and dependencies to be able to properly manage 
its risks. The more well-informed the organisation is about these issues the 
better able it is to make decisions of how to treat and manage its risks due 
to external dependencies. 
3.2  Needs and Expectations
3.2.1  Interested Parties
Generally an ISMS interested party is any person, persons or organisations 
who may be affected by or involved in the development, implementation 
and operation of an organisation’s ISMS. Some interested parties may not 
only be affected by or have an interest in the ISMS, but they also may have 
a legal right or claim to the ISMS such as a shareholder, stakeholder or 
investor. 
Interested parties include employees of the organisation managing the 
ISMS, investors, business partners, suppliers, customers and regulatory 
bodies. Of course, all employees are interested parties of the ISMS in the 
sense that they all should be involved in the implementation and manage­
ment of risk related to their own job function. Some employees, however, 
will have more involvement than others depending on their job function, 
but irrespective of this all should have a vested interest.
Implementing an ISMS should give confidence to all interested parties 
that the risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organi­
sation’s information is being properly and effectively managed. 
3.2.2  Requirements Relevant to the ISMS
Once the interested parties have been identified, then the needs, expec­
tations and requirements of these parties relevant to information security 
should be identified.
3.2.2.1  Stakeholders and Investors
Stakeholders and investors want a good return on investment from the 
ISMS development and implementation that they are funding and support­
ing. This means they want to see that the organisation has an ISMS that is 
effectively managing the risks and opportunities. Stakeholders are clearly 
interested in maximizing the business opportunities to be achieved by im­
plementing the ISMS and at the same time minimising the information se­
curity risks and hence controlling any potential negative business impacts. 
Key to this is of course having a good understanding of the requirements 
of interested parties in order to be able to satisfy these requirements to 

3.2  Needs and Expectations 
31
manage the information security risks and to provide adequate protection 
of the organisation’s information and its business.
3.2.2.2  Customers and Business Partners
Customers, clients and consumers want some confidence that their infor­
mation is being protected (e.g., their PII is safe and secure and will not be 
leaked, stolen or access by those that are not authorized to see or use it).
Case Study: Supply Chains
For those organisations deploying supply chains as part of their business opera­
tions, there are a number of issues and dependencies related to managing the in­
formation security risks. This is specifically of interest to those supply chains that 
involve one or more ISMS implementations as part of the chain. For example, in 
any supply chain scenario the organisation is dependent on a number of business 
activities and functions being integrated into the supply chain processes. Supply 
chain management needs to take into account the security aspects for the deliv­
ery of goods or services across the chain. The business systems in the chain need 
to form secure partnerships to ensure they can react and respond appropriately 
to attacks and incidents targeted at elements in the supply chain. Therefore, it is 
critical that all weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the supply chain are identified. 
Also a good knowledge of the issues involved is relevant to the risks and impacts 
to the chain. 
Disruption in the supply chain can have a ripple effect across the entire 
chain, interrupting activities and processes that depend on each other and finally 
impacting the business of the end user organisation. A security disaster, incident, 
compromise or failure in one part of the chain could have an impact one of more 
other parts in the chain, subsequently affecting one or several organisations in 
the chain. For example, a “botnet” attack could ripple through the chain and 
have a disastrous operational and economic effects.
Of course the incident that caused the disruption in the chain may not be 
man made or IT related, but it might have been caused by an environment prob­
lem (e.g., a flood, tsunami or earthquake). One of the factors to be considered 
in this instance is whether organisations in the supply chain are geographically 
located in high-risk areas or locations prone to natural disasters. 
It is therefore essential for organisations to look at both the business risks 
and the opportunities of deploying supply chains. They need to make sure they 
have factored in all the supply chain dependencies and issues into their infor­
mation security risk assessment, and as a result of this assessment determine an 
effective set of information security controls to manage these risks. They need to 
consider the issues of contingency, continuity and availability of services during 
worst-case scenarios, be prepared for the unexpected and be able to adapt and 
build in reliance mechanisms into their business systems and processes.

32 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard 
Business partners want some assurance that the organisation is fulfill­
ing its contractual obligations (e.g., to deliver a product or service as agreed) 
or that its commercial information is in safe hands and is not been leaked 
or shared with competitors.
3.2.2.3  Connectivity and Outsourcing/Cloud
External customers or partners want some assurance that the networked 
connections they have with the organisation will not be a channel for mal­
ware, hackers or other security breaches. This means that the organisation 
needs to fully address the technical requirements of information security 
incident management and consider some form of information sharing and 
reporting agreement on incidents (which is especially relevant to supply 
change management arrangements).
Many organisations are outsourcing their business activities and so are 
dependent on business partnerships to execute various functional and op­
eration aspects of their business. Examples of this include facilities manage­
ment, transportation services, call centres and back-office activities. It also 
includes the increasing use of outsourcing of IT services, for example, using 
cloud services.
The more dependent organisations are on the use of such outsourcing 
services, the more reliant they are on the external service provider manag­
ing its own risk.
3.2.2.4  Internal Technology Requirements
The  organisation may have a number of internal business requirements 
regarding the use of IT. For example, an  organisation may have a par­
ticular business reason to allow some employees to use bring your own 
Case Study: Supply Chain Requirements
For those organisations deploying supply chains as part of their business 
operations, managing the risks need to consider requirements for: 


Stock control management;


Service delivery management;


Alternative sourcing arrangements;


Business interruption/continuity plans


Off-shore supplies.

3.2  Needs and Expectations 
33
devices (BYOD) at work. Such a requirement means there are a number 
of information security issues to be considered regarding what is accept­
able use of BYOD on site and off site (at home and in public places) as well 
as the security of BYOD itself. The use of BYOD raise questions of protec­
tion of business information on a device that contains private information, 
compliance issues, technical support issues, incompatibility with other IT 
used by the organisation, introduction of malicious code onto the organisa­
tion’s network via BYOD and other risks. One of the other requirements 
in the modern business environment is of course mobile devices, mobile 
networks and services. Mobiles devices may be BYOD or devices such as 
phones or tablets provided by and owned by the organisation itself. Mobile 
devices, networks and services all have information security risks related to 
them and so it is important that an organisation identifies the requirements 
for such IT capability, understands and manages the risks associated with 
such technology and takes account of its requirements for the use of such 
technology in its ISMS risk assessment. This includes dealing with issues of 
theft, what types of business transactions are allowed using such technol­
ogy, whether remote comments to the organisation’s servers are allowed, 
use of wireless networks off site, use of such technology in public places, 
introduction of malware, noncompliance with regulations and secure dis­
posal of such devices. 
In addition, more and more use is being made of cloud services, and 
again the organisation needs to carefully consider its reasons for using such 
services. These services can provide many business benefits, but the security 
aspects need also to be considered. Organisations are finding cloud services 
such as the use of software application services, data storage and manage­
ment and web site hosting to be economically and operational beneficial. 
The information security risks, however, raise questions that the organisa­
tion needs to understand and be able to deal with to protect themselves. 
This includes the security provided by third parties to safeguard sensitive 
and commercial information, as well as any PII that is in the cloud, the 
compliance issues relating to the protection of PII, data segregation of the 
organisation’s information with that of other organisations, physical loca­
tion of the servers used to deliver the cloud services, date recovery in the 
case of a major disaster at the cloud server sites and the investigation of 
incidents at the server sites. 
Another area the organisation needs to consider is its strategy and pol­
icy, and hence its requirements, regarding the use of social networking/
media, by both the business and employees. There are many risks involved 
with the use of social networking/media sites that both the organisation 
and its employees need to be aware of. The organisation therefore needs to 

34 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard 
take account of its requirements for the use of social networking/media in 
its ISMS risk assessment. Its requirements need to be considered alongside 
the potential risks: accidental or innocent disclosure of company confiden­
tial information by employees, intentional disclosure of such information 
for the purpose of fraud, financial gain, or identity theft, as well as the dis­
gruntled employee who wishes to damage the reputation of the organisa­
tion. Other risks include online abuse, stalking, access to and downloading 
of inappr0priate material, social engineering attacks (persuading employees 
to give information away or to trick them into doing something they should 
not be doing) and the introduction of malware embedded in attachments. 
The organisation will need to consider its requirements for the issue of 
acceptable use of all its IT resources and facilities by employees (e.g., use of 
BYOD, mobile devices and networks, cloud services, social media sites and 
so on), which can be included in a corporate Acceptable Use Policy. 
3.2.3  Gathering Requirements Relevant to the ISMS
Information on the needs and expectations of interested parties for infor­
mation security can be gathered in various ways and from different sources:

 Internal business objectives and requirements:

 Corporate policy and objectives;

 Heads of business units and departments, project owners, em­
ployees;

 Risk owners.

 Requirements specified in contracts and service level agreements 
(SLAs):

 Clients and customers will want the organisation to comply with 
any clauses dealing with information and IT security included 
in contracts and SLAs (e.g., this may be a requirement for 24x7 
data management services and call centre services);

 A client may specify in a contract specific requirements for re­
porting on incidents that my affect them. 

 Compliance requirements defined in legislation and regulations:

 There are many laws on the protection of personal data that de­
tail specific information security requirements;

 There are telecommunications regulations that specify informa­
tion security requirements;

 There are laws that relate to relate to the admissibility of elec­
tronic evidence that organisations should be aware of regarding 
the collection of evidence during a security incident.

3.3  ISMS Scope 
35

 Meetings and interviews with internal and external interested parties;

 Internal management review meetings;

 Feedback from customers and business partners.
3.3  ISMS Scope
3.3.1  What to Consider and What to Include 
Defining the ISMS scope is an important initial task in development of the 
ISMS. It is important to get the aspect right before the organisation spends 
it resources in carrying out a risk assessment. This might sound like an 
obvious thing to do, but defining the ISMS scope can present a number of 
challenges. 
The scope needs to take account of the internal and external issues 
referred to in Section 3.1 (see ISO/IEC 27001:2013 4.1) and the require­
ments referred to in Section 3.2 (see ISO/IEC 27001:2013 4.2). In addition, 
the organisation needs to consider all relevant interfaces and dependencies 
between its business operations and those of other organisations. 
The ISMS scope can cover all or part of the organisation, so we need 
to define its boundary in the case that the ISMS scope is only part of the 
organisation (see Figure 3.1). The size of the ISMS scope, whether it is all or 
just part of the organisation, is a management decision and depends on the 
organisation’s business aims and objectives, as well as the motivation for its 
particular choice of ISMS scope. 
The ISMS scope might cover the whole or part of an  organisation, or 
an  organisation might choose to implement several ISMS. The ISMS scope 
might be defined and cover the activities of a business unit or department, 
a project activity or a set of business functions or services.

3.3.2  Object of ISMS Scope
Experience and feedback of existing implementations around the world in­
form us that organisations are selecting the ISMS route and a particular 
scope of application to achieve at least one of the following aims:

 Minimise the business impact and financial costs of security incidents 
in one or more business areas to:

 Improve service delivery to customers;

 Increase staff morale, productivity and effectiveness;

 Reduce loss of contracts, sales, orders or profits; 

 Improve and enhance customer trust, confidence and relations, 
and meet contractual obligations of its customer(s), such as in 
the case of a company providing managed services to its clients; 

 Improve market position;

 Reduce loss of assets and asset value;

 Reduce e-risks;

 Avoid legal/contractual penalties/liabilities;

 Reduce breaches of operating controls.

 Reduce the number and frequency of incidents in one or more busi­
ness areas:

 Human errors;

 Service interruptions;

 Misuse/abuse of company resources;

 Theft, fraud and other related crimes;

 Malfunctions, system failures or system downtimes.

 Comply with a set of laws and regulations, such as the data privacy 
directive in the EU and the equivalent laws in the EU Member States, 
or comply with the Sarbanes Oxley (SoX) or HIPPA regulations in the 
US;

 As a market differentiator (e.g., a company that offers online—per­
haps Internet banking service—or offline—say, media disposal or data 
recovery services);

 Enhance corporate value of the business and as a business enabler:

 Maximise business opportunities and investments;

 Provide more informed decision making about security risks;

 Improve risk awareness, risk control and information security ef­
fectiveness for the  organisation’s sensitive and critical assets;

 Facilitate an organisationwide information security risk culture.

3.3  ISMS Scope


 Publicly demonstrate that they are “fit for purpose” by means of a 
third-party independent audit, such as providing a particular line or 
type of customer-facing service (help desk and call centre facilities), 
as part of a supply chain, as a supplier of products or as a supplier of 
infrastructure supporting services (electronic signatures for secure 
payments and transactions).
3.3.3  Defining the ISMS Scope
Whatever the  organisation decides its ISMS scope to be, it must ensure 
that it is well defined and covers all that it should cover in terms of require­
ments (ISO/IEC 27001:2013 4.2) and issues (ISO/IEC 27001:2013 4.1). The 
organisation should not exclude things from within the ISMS boundary if 
they seem to be difficult to deal with, as such exclusions could affect the 
organisation’s ability or responsibility to provide information security that 
meets the security requirements determined by risk assessment and appli­
cable legislative and regulatory requirements.
Depending on the scope of the ISMS, this might typically include:

 The staff and employees operationally involved in the ISMS area of 
work;

 The processes and services used within the ISMS area of work;

 The information and information systems necessary to carry out the 
business of the ISMS; 

 The policies, procedures and documentation to be deployed necessary 
to carry out the business of the ISMS; 

 The interfaces and connections to the ISMS;

 Supporting ICT infrastructure for the ISMS;

 The physical location(s) of the ISMS.
3.3.4  Scope Example
An example ISMS scope is a sales and customer service department of small 
manufacturing company. This group is just one of several departments in 
the company as shown in the in Figure 3.2.
The scope of the ISMS will typically involve:

 The sales and customer services personnel;

38 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard 

 The procedures used by the personnel:

 Company polices and procedures;

 Operating manual, 

 Security policies and procedures.

 Sales and customer service information:

 Customer details; 

 Customer orders, invoices;

 Internal company data;

 Data from other companies.

 Use of business processes, applications and services:

 Sales orders processes;

 e-commerce;

 Customer enquires processes;

 IT services.

 Interfaces and dependencies:

 Technical;

 Nontechnical.

 Use of technology:

 Desktop computers and other IT equipment;

 Networks;

 Telephones, mobiles, tablets.

 Physical location.
This example illustrates an ISMS scope that is only part of the travel 
company operations and the services it provides. Other scoping examples 
include:

 Internal services supplied by the ICT department;


 Call centre;

 Internal help desk support;

 An  organisation’s claims and payments department for its customers; 

 ICT-based logistics support for a shipping or an airline company; 

 The online hotel booking system for an international hotel chain;

 A research and development group of a software company.
3.3.5  External and Internal Connections
An important aspect of the ISMS scope is the connections that exist to and 
from the ISMS, whether these are with external customer or supplier sys­
tems or other parts of the same organisation. In the previous example, typi­
cal internal connections might be with the personnel department, those 
dealing with IT services and those dealing with physical security. External 
connections might typically be those with other banks, networks and ISP 
service providers. It is important to consider these connection interfaces 
since these interfaces are one of the ways that risks might present them­
selves to the ISMS. Management and control of the flows of information 
across these interfaces is important to protect the ISMS against these risks.
Managing these interfaces can be done in many ways through the use 
of contracts, SLAs and the use of operational procedures and technical con­
trols. ISO/IEC 27002 (clause 6.2) provides a list of things to be considered 
when researching the inclusion of security aspects in contracts and SLAs.

Managing the ISMS Risks
4.1  The Importance of Risk and 
Opportunity
4.1.1  Definition of Risk
There are several important changes in the 
area of risk management in the 2013 edition 
of ISO/IEC 27001 in comparison with the 2005 
edition. One of these is the definition of risk, 
which has been made more generic and thus 
oriented toward a greater range of methods and 
techniques of assessing risks.
ISO/IEC 27001 (2013) is now aligned with 
the definition of risk used in ISO Guide 73 and 
ISO 31000, that is, risk is the effect of uncertainty 
(on objectives). The elements of this definition 
can be interpreted in several ways, so “effect” 
can be thought of as the consequences or impact 
of an event occurring such as the consequences 
of a malware incident on an email server. The 
uncertainty could be that related to an event or 
incident (e.g., the likelihood of an unauthorised 
access attempt on a system containing sensitive 
information). The objectives could include the 
information security objectives found in ISO/
IEC 27001 (i.e., preserving the confidentiality, 
integrity or availability of information). Anoth­
er objective is that the ISMS is effective, suitable 

42 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
and adequate to meet the organisation’s needs and requirements. So com­
bining these elements we could have, as an example of a risk, the business 
impact of unauthorised access attempts on a system containing sensitive 
information would be detrimental to the  organisation, not only damaging 
its reputation but also costing them $X in loss of revenue and potential legal 
penalties, and the likelihood or chances of this happening is Y out of Z.
4.1.2  Opportunity
An  organisation needs to identify the opportunities that will contribute to 
achieving its strategic and business objectives. This can sometimes mean 
taking risks to gain access to these opportunities and sometimes reducing 
the risks to ensure these opportunities are available. The “effect” element 
in the definition of risk, given in Section 4.1.1, can also be interpreted as 
the deviation from the expected, that is, in terms of both positive as well as 
negative results, consequences or outcomes. This might be also expressed in 
terms of good or bad fortune, exposure to gain or loss, upside risk (favour­
able outcome) or downside risk (unfavourable outcome). This means that 
an organisation needs to create a balance between those negative risks that 
prevent opportunity and those positive risks that help to secure opportuni­
ties, and this will depend on the  organisations risk attitude, tolerance and 
appetite.
4.1.3  Risk Attitude, Tolerance and Appetite
Should a business miss an opportunity to avoid risks or should the business 
accept/take risks to gain from the opportunity? This relates to the risk atti­
tude of the organisation: are they risk averse (avoiding), risk neutral or risk 
affine (seeking) when it comes to going for business opportunities? The risk 
averse (risk avoiding) individual will try to reduce the uncertainty of a risk 
(i.e., when faced with either a choice where the loss or gain is uncertain or 
an option which is more certain but may result in lower gain, they would 
select the latter, more certain option). The risk seeker on the other hand 
takes a gamble on the uncertainty in the hope of a greater gain. 
The risk attitude is a factor in determining their risk appetite to a situa­
tion or set of business choices. Risk appetite is the amount and type of risk 
that an organisation is willing to pursue, take, accept or retain to achieve 
its strategic and business objectives. Hence an organisation’s risk appetite 
is linked to the pursuit of business opportunity. Different organisations 
have different risk appetites. An organisation with a low risk appetite wants 
to avoid the negative effects of the uncertainty of risk; it wants to pursue 

4.1  The Importance of Risk and Opportunity 
43
guaranteed gain from a business investment and not gamble on an un­
certainty for a much higher gain. At the other end of the spectrum, risk-
seeking organisations seek to gain higher rewards by selecting business op­
portunities and business innovations. Risk tolerance is the level or amount 
of risk an organisation is willing and able to accept.
The risk appetite and the levels of risk tolerance need to be defined by 
executive or senior management in conjunction with the board of directors 
and the CEO. 
4.1.4  Information Security Risk Appetite and Tolerance
The information security risk appetite should be a part of the organisation’s 
overall risk appetite. Defining the information security risk appetite, as with 
other risk decisions and criteria, should not therefore be an isolated activity 
but an integrated part of the organisation’s overall strategy and objectives 
on risk. ISO/IEC 27001 emphasises the importance of the fact that manage­
ment of risk comes from the top, with commitment, direction and decisions 
being made by executive/senior management. 
Information security management should be seen as a driver for achiev­
ing the organisation’s business strategy and objectives, and to add value to 
the organisation. Therefore, the risks related to information security need 
to be managed to achieve such business objectives and to satisfy internal 
and external requirements. The outcome and deliverables of the ISMS is 
therefore to provide effective protection of the organisation’s information 
to achieve these business objectives and requirements.
Traditionally information security risks have been seen in a negative 
way, to protect against loss or damage, and not in the context of business 
opportunity to address the broader business strategy. However, as just men­
tioned, information security is not an isolated activity but one of the key 
drivers for an organisation to protect its business interests through protect­
ing the information it uses to run and operate its business.
Of course there are information security risks related to legal, regula­
tory and compliance requirements, which the organisation needs to ad­
dress, and because of the nature of these types of requirements sometimes 
there is no clear view of any underlying business opportunity. However, 
even in the cases of mandatory compliance there is always an aspect of 
business opportunity, which is especially the case as the approach to the 
management of risk is taken as part of business strategy. Conformity to 
the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 demonstrates that the organisation is 
protecting its information and this includes addressing the risks using legal 

44 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
controls and protection. For example, the protection of personal data or 
personally identifiable information should start with the compliance with 
laws and regulations pertaining to the country of business. An example of 
this might be any service an organisation offers that involves the managing 
and processing of customer data, including customer PII. The service makes 
money for the organisation and so provides a business opportunity, but in 
pursuit of this opportunity the organisation needs to comply with the legal 
requirements that are relevant to its customer data and ensure adequate 
protection is provided in conformity with these requirements.    
In considering information security appetite and tolerance, executive man­
agement decisions need to be made taking into account legal advice and 
counsel of the regulatory and legislative aspects. 
4.1.5  ISMS Risks 
Managing the effect of uncertainty on achieving the objectives, outcomes, 
targets and deliverables of the ISMS is the risk management task at hand. 
Are the information security risks managed to a tolerable level of accep­
tance so that the ISMS is effective, suitable and adequate for the organisa­
tion’s needs and requirements? Does the organisation have effective, suit­
able and adequate ISMS policies, procedures, resources, processes, plans 
and programmes in place to manage the risks? 
Things can change in an organisation and its business environment, 
which could have an effect on its risk profile: the business objectives and 
strategy may vary or change; operating conditions might change; market 
conditions might fluctuate—there may be economic downturns and up­
turns; the conditions surrounding and causing security incidents might 
change, with increased uncertainty regarding these incidents and greater 
threats and attack levels; there may be changes to infrastructure, internal 
and external; different business processes might be adopted; new and ad­
vanced technology may be deployed by the business. For example, the or­
ganisation might expand in a new business area and at the same introduce 
new technological solutions and deploy more staff as part of this expan­
sion. The question is asked as to whether this expansion leads to changes 
that create new risks, or increase the level of current known risks, to the 
protection of its information. Is the ISMS still able to be effective, suitable 
and adequate to the organisation? This is what management should be ask­
ing. When changes occur, the organisation should reassess the risks and 
the opportunities associated with these changes as part of their continual 
improvement programme (i.e., addressing the risks to ensure that the ISMS 
remains effective, suitable and adequate for the organisation’s needs and 
requirements). 

4.2  Risk Management Process 
45
4.2  Risk Management Process
4.2.1  Changes in the Process
As mentioned earlier, risk is the effect of uncertainty (on objectives). In 
the 2005 version of ISO/IEC 27001 there was mention of assets, threats 
and vulnerabilities in relation to the definition risk. So there was a need to 
identify the threats to assets and the vulnerabilities of the assets that the 
threats could exploit. These elements that made up part of the definition 
of risk in the 2005 no longer exist in the 2013 version of the standard. This 
does not mean, however, that an organisation that uses a risk assessment 
method using these elements needs to change its method. The 2013 defini­
tion is generic enough to accommodate a wide range of methods. What it 
does mean is that there is no mandatory requirement, in the 2013 edition, 
for an organisation to identify its assets, threats and vulnerabilities as part 
of its risk assessment, as was the case in the 2005 edition.
The overall process stages are the same: risk assessment and then risk 
treatment. Also stages in the risk assessment process are the same: risk iden­
tification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. What is different is in the detail 
of what constitutes identification, analysis and evaluation (i.e., there is no 
mention of assets, threats and vulnerabilities in the 2013 edition).
4.2.2  Risk Assessment
4.2.2.1  Process
It is entirely up to the organisation to define what information security 
risk assessment process it uses. This includes what methods and criteria it 
uses to identify and analyse its risks, and what acceptance criteria it uses to 
evaluate the risks it has identified. The 2013 version of ISO/IEC 27001 gives 
the organisation a lot of flexibility to define its own approach to suit its own 
business culture and to select the methods and techniques it wants to use as 
part of this approach. This approach needs to conform to the requirements 
defined in ISO/IEC 27001.
The assessment process should provide the organisation with an under­
standing of the risks they face. This is typically in terms of the risk causes 
and effects (consequences/impacts) and the likelihood of occurrence, the 
levels of risk and whether these levels are acceptable/nonacceptable in ac­
cordance with the acceptance criteria as defined by the organisation. 
4.2.2.2  Acceptance Criteria
What is acceptable/tolerable or unacceptable/intolerable is defined by the 
organisation. The criteria for determining what acceptable levels of risk are 
will depend of the organisation’s risk appetite and the significance of the 

46 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
risks to the organisation’s business, objectives and values. The risks should 
also reflect both internal and external interests and requirements, relevant 
standards, laws and regulations.   
4.2.2.3  Risk Owners
A very important requirement of the standard and the risk assessment pro­
cess is to identify risk owners, that is, those individuals in the organisation 
that are accountable, and have the authority, for decisions regarding the 
management of the risks and ultimately regarding managing the risks. So, 
for example, an individual that is authorized and accountable for managing 
and controlling personal data of employees and staff would be the obvious 
person to be the risk owner of such information. Such an individual would 
be responsible, for example, for signing off the implementation of a set of 
controls for the protection this personal data and for approving the resulting 
level of residual risk and for the long-term accountability and risk manage­
ment of this personal data. The same situation applies to all the other risk 
owners in the organisation. 
4.2.2.4  Risk Identification
The process of identifying information security risks involves the identifica­
tion and recognition of what could happen, which may have an impact on 
the organisation’s ISMS and its ability to realize its business strategy and 
objectives. This includes events, incidents, potential breaches and compro­
mises or any other situation that might have an impact on the organisation. 
Another aspect of this risk assessment stage is the identification of existing 
ISMS controls that are in place.  
The identification process involves gathering together information re­
garding the risks obtained from individual and team interviews; feedback, 
opinions and views from stakeholders interested parties and experts; ques­
tionnaires/check-lists; records of information security incident manage­
ment records and other historical data records such as audit reports and 
through various other methods and sources. 
It is important that those involved in the information gathering and 
identification process recognize that risk perception can vary from one in­
dividual to another (e.g., what one individual perceives as a risk or a risk-
related event may be differently perceived by another individual). Those 
in control of the identification process need to take account the possible 
variations in risk perceptions from both a human perspective as well as a 
corporate perspective. 
The output of the identification process should be a list of risks, which 
will then be used during the risk analysis process (see next).

4.2  Risk Management Process 
47
4.2.2.5  Risk Analysis
The analysis stage deals with determining the potential consequences/im­
pacts of the risks, the likelihood of the risks occurring and the level of the 
risks. The level of risk is the combination of the consequences/impacts and 
the likelihoods. Figure 4.1 illustrates an example risk method for determin­
ing the level of risk given the potential impact (VL = very low through to 
VH = very high) and likelihood (VL = very low through to VH = very high). 
The risk levels in this example are given numerical values 1 = low risk 
through to 9 = very high risk. Clearly, this illustrates that on a sliding scale, 
the higher the impact and the higher the likelihood are, the higher the risk 
level will be. 
During this stage of risk assessment, the causes and sources of risk need 
to be understood and considered, and subsequently the impacts and likeli­
hood of these risks related to these causes need to be analysed. Of course 
there can be complex cause and effect scenarios: a set of different events add 
up to a specific risk. For example, an untrained member of staff who has 
little experience uses a badly written operational procedure, and this results 
in sensitive information being sent as an email attachment unprotected. The 
more experienced member of staff who has more experience and awareness 
of how to handle sensitive information may ignore the badly written proce­
dure and protect the email attachment. This sequence of events and causes 
resulted in a risk for the organisation of its sensitive information. 
An event may result in multiple consequences, which combine togeth­
er to have an impact on several information security objectives. Of course, 
it might require a combination of causes to have an impact on the organisa­
tion. It is essential that the knock-on effects of causes and consequences are 
identified, including any cascading and cumulative consequences.
There are as many different ways and methods of doing the risk analysis as 
there are ways of doing risk identification. A group of staff carrying out a 
Figure 4.1  Example risk table.

48 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
brainstorming or interviewing exercise is certainly relevant for a risk identi­
fication, but not for calculating the impact or likelihood of the risks where a 
more systematic and analytic method is more useful and applicable. On the 
other hand, a cause-effect (scenario) analysis or a business impact analysis 
(BIA) is clearly relevant to the risk analysis with regard to consequences/
impacts of the risk. Furthermore, root-cause analysis methods and “what-
if” scenario methods cover both the consequence/impact and likelihood as­
pects of risk analysis.
In carrying out the risk analysis, it is important to understand the events 
that are likely have an impact on the types of information the organisation 
has: sensitive, critical, personal, restricted, private information and public 
information. The preservation of this information may be at risk, specifi­
cally regarding its confidentiality, integrity and availability. In addition, the 
protection of PII is also an issue. So, analysis of the events and causes that 
threaten this preservation is essential. This analysis can be carried out using 
different methods, including some of those mentioned earlier (e.g., cause-
effect analysis, BIA), with input and feedback from various sources that 
are a legitimate and authorized interested party in this information (e.g., 
information owners, risk owners, top/senior management, users). In the 
same way that preserving business information is important, so are the criti­
cal business systems, process or services that are associated with the ISMS 
directly or indirectly. Such critical elements should be understood and their 
risks identified. Disruption, unavailability or continuity to these critical parts 
will have a high impact and detrimental consequences on the organisation 
and could have a dire affect on the organisation’s operations. The complex­
ity of the ISMS being risk assessed will depend on the resources (cost, time, 
competence) needed to do the risk analysis. This in part also depends on the 
scope of the ISMS: a well-focused scope oriented to a single business group, 
department, project or service, with well-defined noncomplex interfaces 
and dependencies is one level of complexity, whereas a scope that covers 
many operational sites, many parts of the of the business, many projects or 
many services with a complex set of interfaces and dependencies is a differ­
ent, higher level of complexity.
4.2.2.6  Risk Table Scales
The organisation has the choice of which risk method it wants to use, the 
criteria for acceptance and the particular scales for assigning the levels of 
likelihood and the types and level of impact. In the example given in Fig­
ure 4.1, low, medium, high and very high are used for levels of impact and 
likelihood. Instead an organisation might decide to use a 3-point or 4-point 
scale, or a 6-point or higher scale. The organisation may wish to provide a 
more descriptive meaning to these points on the scale low, medium, high 

4.2  Risk Management Process 
49
and very high. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 are examples to illustrate how this might 
look. 
It is entirely up to the  organisation whether it adopts a set of descrip­
tors and the content of the descriptor. Whatever is adopted by the organi­
sation should be aligned with its business objectives, culture and internal 
standards and methods it chooses to adopt (e.g., it would make sense to 
adopt the same descriptors it uses for other risk management activities it 
undertakes to achieve a corporate consistency, but again this is entirely up 
to the organisation to decide—these examples are merely generic illustra­
tions to described the overall risk assessment process). 
4.2.2.7  Risk Analysis of Existing ISMS Controls
Defining the level of risk should take account of existing ISMS controls and 
their suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. This involves considering what 
existing controls there are in place and their relevance to each of the risks 
that are identified and whether these controls are suitable and adequate to 
modify the risk to a tolerable level. 
What level of effectiveness is provided by these existing controls? Are 
they user friendly or difficult to use? Do they work in the way they were 
intended to work? Are measurements available that will indicate the level 
of effectiveness? 
In considering existing controls, one of the decision-making questions 
is whether it is best to improve the implementation of these existing con­
trols to adequately modify the risks identified or whether it is best to imple­
ment a different set of controls.
Figure 4.2  Example impact scale descriptors.

Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
4.2.2.8  Risk Evaluation
The evaluation stage compares the results of the risk analysis stage, that is, 
the levels of risk with the organisation’s acceptance criteria. For example, 
in the example in Figure 4.1, risk levels of 7 and above might be considered 
unacceptable and intolerable (dark grey area in Figure 4.4 ), whereas levels 
1–3 are considered acceptable, tolerable and in general negligible (white 
area in Figure 4.4). On the other hand, risk levels 4–6 might require further 
analysis on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the business costs and 
benefits of risk treatment, and business opportunities against the business 
impacts, to determine whether any risks at these levels are acceptable or 
unacceptable (mid-grey area in Figure 4.4). 
Figure 4.4 is merely one example of a risk acceptance heat map. The 
organisation needs to define its own dark-grey, mid-grey and white areas, 
and this will depend on the organisation’s risk appetite. For example, an 
organisation might adopt the following heat map in Figure 4.5, as it has a 
lower risk acceptance.
Another  organisation might adopt the heat map in Figure 4.6, as it has 
a higher risk acceptance.
The choice of risk criteria acceptance and risk appetite is entirely up to 
each organisation to define. Figures 4.4 to 4.6 are merely examples to illus­
trate the theory. Practical implementation is up to the organisation to select 
which risk criteria is suitable and adequate for its own business situation 
and circumstances.

4.2.2.9  Risk Evaluation Decision Making
So at this evaluation stage of the risk assessment, decisions need to be made 
as to whether risk treatment is needed to modify the identified risks to an 
acceptable level. The risks in the middle band in our example in Figure 4.2 
Figure 4.4  Example risk acceptance heat map (1).

Figure 4.6  Example risk acceptance heat map (3).

Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
may, after an analysis of the business costs and benefits of risk treatment, 
and business opportunities against the business impacts, fall into the unac­
ceptable region (the upper band of the dark grey area) or they may stay in 
the middle band and, for example, may be classed as “for close monitoring 
and an early review/reassessment” to make sure the situation can be man­
aged and does not change and creep into the upper band. Therefore, in the 
middle band, there is likely to be a scale of risks from the boundary (lower 
band) of almost being acceptable to the boundary of being not acceptable 
(upper band) and so the cost-benefits/business opportunities/business im­
pacts need some comparative management decision making. One thing is 
certain—the cost of risk treatment needs to be kept in check to avoid the 
cost of modifying the risk becoming disproportionate to the business ben­
efits and opportunities to be gained in engaging in a business activity that 
is associated with the cause of the risks. Therefore, management and risk 
owners need to be involved in this type of decision making, where the 
costs-benefits of risk treatment versus nonrisk treatment, balanced out with 
the business opportunities and impacts, are being considered in addition to 
any legal or regulatory issues related to the risks where legal council/advi­
sors need to be consulted.
This decision making needs to consider the prioritization of the risks for 
treatment purposes. One of the major purposes of risk prioritization is to 
help in the allocation of resources to the treatment of risks and the imple­
mentation of ISMS controls to modify the risks, and of course the ongoing 
daily maintenance and upkeep of the ISMS. 
Risks should be prioritized according to the most critical through to least 
critical ranking (e.g., very high impact, very high likelihood risks). The pri­
oritization needs to take into account an assessment of the overall impact 
on the organisation and its critical systems and processes. High-impact risks 
regarding the commercial interests of the organisation need attention and 
generally fall into the category of critical, as might high-impact risks that 
might affect critical business systems or processes. Of course, the risk might 
be of high impact but only medium likelihood (falling into the mid-grey 
area); nevertheless, the risk relates to some piece of legislation (e.g., protec­
tion of personal data), in which case the priority criteria is in compliance 
with legislation. 
4.2.3  Risk Treatment
After identifying the risks and prioritizing the risks for treatment, then the 
next process is to consider the treatment options that will modify the risks. 
The risk treatment process is typically an iterative process as illustrated in 
Figure 4.7.

4.2  Risk Management Process 
53
Also included in the process is assessing how effective the risk treat­
ment is at modifying the risk.
The selection process needs to be involve management as consideration 
needs to be given to the costs of treatment implementation against the busi­
ness benefits that come from such treatment, taking into account the com­
pliance requirements from legal, regulatory and contractual obligations. It 
might be the case that there are strong financial and business impact rea­
sons regarding whether a treatment option is feasible. It might be the case, 
for example, that the impact on the organisation of damage to its reputation 
is very high but the likelihood of this happening is considered to be low to 
medium, which would place the risk into the middle band of risk, neither 
tolerable nor intolerable. This would mean further management discussion 
and enquiry into the economics of treatment. 
The following are some typical types of treatment options:

 Risk avoidance (risk averse):

 Terminate activities that currently cause the risk;

 Postpone/cancel plans/projects/activities that could cause the 
risk.

 Risk taking (risk affine):

 Pursuit of opportunity.

 Removing the source of the risk;

 Risk transfer:

 Insurance;
Figure 4.7  Risk treatment cycle.

54 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 Contracts;

 Risk financing.

 Retaining the risk:

 Knowingly and objectively accepting the risks through well-
informed decisions.

 Modifying the risk by reducing/changing the likelihood;

 Modifying the risk by reducing the consequences/impact.
4.2.3.1  Risk Avoidance
Avoidance includes making the decision to not carry out, engage in or per­
form an activity that could cause the risk. Risk avoidance might involve 
changing the following:

 Company policy or strategy;

 Plans for location or relocating of business facilities;

 Methods, procedures or processes used;

 Operational conditions;

 Scope and objectives of new projects, developments or technology be­
ing used.
An example might be the relocation of the business to an area that is 
found to be less environmentally hazardous in order to not take on the li­
ability that comes with the likelihood of these hazards occurring and inter­
rupting, disrupting or destroying the business and its operations. It might 
be that the site for relocation is in a less dangerous area of a city to avoid 
serious incidents involving criminal activities and civil disorder. Avoiding 
this risk may seem a way of dealing with this problem but consideration 
needs to be given as to whether the organisation will be at a commercial 
disadvantage or will lose out on the benefits of not relocating. 
Management thinking needs to weigh up the pros and cons of either 
avoiding the risk in order to take the opportunity of safer operating condi­
tions or taking the risk in order to take the opportunity of other business 
benefits that may be afforded by the current location such as its customer 
base. The same avoidance strategy might taken regarding the risks of taking 
on new research projects, selecting backup sites for business continuity pur­
poses or embracing new technologies such as digital accounting or online 
business. 

4.2  Risk Management Process 
55
4.2.3.2  Transferring the Risks
This treatment method involves employing another party, such as an insur­
ance company, suppliers, venture capital business and external parties, to 
share some or all of the risk. Typically this could be by contract, insurance 
or by some form of hedging. Insurance is one type of risk transfer that uses 
contracts and in recent times e-risks insurance protection has started to 
emerge on world markets. Other means of transfer might involve the use 
of contract language that transfers the risk to another party without the 
use of an insurance premium. Such a contract might set limits of liability 
on contractors or service suppliers are very often transferred this way. Of 
course, in the financial world there are many other instruments of transfer 
for financially managing risks, such as taking offsetting positions in order to 
hedge against investment losses.
4.2.3.3  Reducing the Likelihood of the Risks
This involves using preventive, deterrent or detective types of control meth­
ods to reduce the likelihood of the risk happening in the first place or at 
least to make it more difficult for the risk to occur. 
Information security polies, procedures and processes, user training and 
awareness programmes, removal of weaknesses, access control methods, 
and other measures can help to reduce the likelihood of risks. The actual 
effectiveness of these controls to reduce the likelihood will depend on the 
quality and effectiveness of the implementation and its operational/busi­
ness use. For example, a control designed to prevent a security incident 
from being successful may not be effective in practice if the implementation 
is faulty or not properly done, and of course if users are not trained in the 
use of the control this also reduces the effectiveness of the control.
Procedures for instructing users on how to handle sensitive information 
can reduce the likelihood of errors and mistakes being made by users and 
the risk of such information being leaked to unauthorised users. Similarly a 
process for securely disposing of media used no longer can reduce the like­
lihood of information stored on that media falling into the hands of those 
unauthorised to see such information.
Controls that are able to protect against malware incidents help to re­
duce the likelihood of malware infections. If those same controls have the 
ability to recover from malware infections, they also help in reducing the 
impact of the infection if they are used in an effective and timely way. 
Access controls can restrict the systems, applications, privileges and in­
formation that users can access, and the stronger these controls are the 
less likely it will be that unauthorised access will take place. This means 
the more difficult it is to penetrate through the access control system, the 

56 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
lower the likelihood of the risk happening—and it is much lower than if 
there were no access control system or the system was weak (i.e., easy to 
penetrate).
There are many controls that have the ability to reduce the likelihood 
of a risk happening and being realized. Of course, when a risk does mate­
rialize, then it can have a direct impact on the operational performance of 
the ISMS and so controls to reduce or minimise this impact also need to be 
considered. Some controls are able to work in combination to achieve both 
a reduction in likelihood and impact. 
4.2.3.4  Reducing the Consequences of the Risks
If risk becomes a reality because, for example, the control methods for re­
ducing the likelihood are ineffective, inadequate or unsuitable to prevent 
the risk, then controls are needed to reduce the consequences/impact of the 
risk. This includes using detective, responsive, reactive or recovery types of 
control methods to reduce the severity of the impact or loss caused by the 
risk. 
Information security procedures and processes, information security 
incident management processes, business continuity and disaster recovery 
plans can all help to reduce the impact of risks. 
Lack of management support, commitment and leadership for the 
ISMS; lack of management reviews and lack of or ineffective performance 
evaluation exercises can result in business impacts. The impact on the or­
ganisation failing to continually improve the suitability, adequacy and effec­
tiveness of the ISMS will mean its ability to protect its sensitive and critical 
information will decrease and become ineffective. This will result in other 
impacts that will affect the organisation being able to carry out its business 
properly, productively and profitably. 
An information security incident management process detects, inves­
tigates, responds to, reacts to and resolves actual, suspected or potential 
information security–related events. This process results in actions aimed 
to avoid or reduce the consequences/impact of the incident or reduce the 
likelihood of a further reoccurrences of the incident. 
Some risks can cause severe disruption to an organisation’s operations 
and productivity. Clearly, when such a disruption takes place the organisa­
tion wants to recover its business as soon as possible, as downtimes and 
lack of availability of systems and processes can have many impacts such as 
financial implications in terms of lost revenue, reduced productivity, lower 
quality levels, reduction in service levels, damage to its business reputation, 
harm to the trust and confidence its customers have in its business and the 
potential loss of customers who are not satisfied with loss of services as a 
result of the disruption.  

4.2  Risk Management Process 
57
The risks in some areas can have severe and dire business consequences and 
impacts. Lack of control regarding compliance with laws and regulations 
can leave the organisation with severe legal repercussions: fines, penalties, 
legal fees (e.g., failure to protect staff’s and customers’ personal data accord­
ing to national legislation around the world).
In the area of physical security, computer rooms need to be protected 
against the risk of unauthorised access. Implementing physical access con­
trols reduces the likelihood of risk of unauthorised access. However, if these 
controls are breached, then detective/response/reactive controls are needed 
to reduce the impact of the risk, (e.g., alarm systems, CCTV systems and so 
on).
4.2.3.5  Retaining/Accepting the Risks
This means the organisation is able to tolerate and retain the risk within its 
business risk management strategy by accepting the impact or loss when it 
occurs. Management must be fully knowledgeable and objective about this 
course of action and think carefully before adopting this type of treatment. 
At the end of the day, perhaps there is no other course of appropriate action 
to take. By default, all risks that are not avoided, transferred, reduced or 
transferred are retained. 
Risk sharing within a group of individuals or companies is also a risk 
retention option. This involves spreading the risk across the group by trans­
ferring the risk liabilities and losses to all those members involved in the 
group. This is not the transfer by insurance option. 
When the risks are small, acceptance or retention is a viable and fi­
nancial strategic option. Of course, we need to bear in mind what might be 
small to one organisation may not be small to another in terms of the costs 
and financial impact they are able to sustain. Acceptance of risk is especially 
the case where the cost of reducing or transferring the risk could add up in 
the end to be greater in the long run than the total losses sustained. 
4.2.4  Determine the Controls
After the risk treatment options have been selected, a set of controls need 
to be determined to implement these options—see Chapter 6 on controls to 
modify risks. A gap analysis is then carried out comparing this set of con­
trols with the controls set out in Annex A. This check aims to make sure 
that no control areas are overlooked. 
This process appears in the 2013 edition of ISO/IEC 27001 but not the 
2005 edition. The process that was defined in the 2005 selected controls 
from Annex A, which is not the case in the 2013 edition—see Chapter 6, 
Section 6.1.1. 

58 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
4.2.5  Statement of Applicability
The results of the control determination and gap analysis processes are 
brought together in what is called a Statement of Applicability (SoA). This 
provides a useful record of the results of risk assessment and risk treatment 
processes. The SoA is also a key piece of documentation for ISMS certifica­
tion audits (see Chapter 10).
4.2.6  Risk Treatment Plan
A risk treatment plan should be produced that details how the risk treat­
ment options that have been chosen will be implemented by the organi­
sation. This plan should provide the reasons that the specific selection of 
treatment options has been chosen and what the expected benefits that the 
organisation expects to gain are. The plan should detail the priorities for 
and actions to be taken to implement the treatment options, as well as legal 
and regulatory measures to be taken, the resources required for the imple­
mentation, and the schedule and action delivery dates for implementation. 
Those risk owners who are accountable for approving the plan need to be 
identified, as well as those responsible for implementing the plan. In addi­
tion, performance metrics and measurements need to be determined, and a 
reporting mechanism needs to be specified.  
4.2.7  Risk Owners’ Duties
The risk owners that are accountable and have the authority for decisions 
regarding the management of the risks and ultimately regarding actually 
managing the risks need to approve the residual levels of risk as well as ap­
prove and sign off on the risk treatment plan.   
4.3  Ongoing Reassessment of Risk
4.3.1  Risk Reviews and Reassessments
A risk assessment is a snapshot in time of the risks the organisation faces 
when the assessment is carried out. The conditions, circumstances and oth­
er factors that were applicable to the risks that were identified during any 
assessment will change at some point in time; this is the nature of every­
thing in the world around us—nothing is permanent. 
Organisations should expect that changes will happen, and that this 
will change their risk profile. For this reason, a reassessment of the risks 
needs to be undertaken at regular intervals. What is a regular interval? 
This is up to the organisation to determine; however, typically this could be 
every six to nine months or sooner if there are known or planned changes 

4.3  Ongoing Reassessment of Risk 
59
or there is a major incident or event that has caused disruptive risks to the 
organisation. Some organisations set their reassessment interval at three to 
four months because of the nature of their business environment and the 
dynamic business environment they operate in. 
4.3.2  Risk Monitoring
As conditions and factors that will have an effect on the risk profile of an 
organisation will change, vary and fluctuate, ongoing monitoring is essen­
tial to keep up to date and for continual improvement of the ISMS to ensure 
suitable, adequate and effective protection. In Chapter 9 we shall look into 
the topic of monitoring and measurements in more detail. At this point we 
shall only provide an overview of the importance of risk monitoring.
4.3.3  Updating the Risk Treatment
After reassessing the risks, there will be a need to reassess the ISMS risk 
treatment options. This needs to take into consideration whether to take 
corrective action to improve the existing set of controls, to implement a 
different set of controls and select additional treatment options. This will 
involve producing an updated risk treatment plan.

5.1  Management Policy
An important aspect of conformance to the re­
quirements of ISO/IEC 27001 and of achieving 
a successful ISMS development and implemen­
tation and ongoing management is that such 
task should be driven and led from the top, by 
top management. 
Top management should start by defining 
an appropriate information security policy for 
the ISMS. The policy should be a clear man­
agement statement of its intentions, objec­
tives and goals regarding information security 
and the protection of its information systems. 
This policy should reflect top management 
commitment and support for the ISMS to sat­
isfy the requirements in Section 4.1 (ISO/IEC 
27001:2013) and address the issues in Section 
4.2 (ISO/IEC 27001:2013). It should be a direc­
tive from above that typically should address at 
least the following: 

62 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 The scope of information security, its importance to the business, and 
clarity about what the business information security objectives are 
(e.g., regarding the protection of the confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of its information);

 The need for staff awareness: staff should be aware of their duties and 
responsibilities regarding the risks (e.g., their responsibility to handle 
and process sensitive company information in way that protects it 
from compromise); 

 What is acceptable and not acceptable with regard to behaviour and 
use of its resources (e.g., acceptable use of the company email system);

 Its obligations to carry out its business in compliance with the laws 
and regulations, contractual obligations, best practices and standards 
that staff also need to comply with (e.g., compliance with laws on 
copyright, data privacy/protection and computer use/misuse/abuse); 

 Reference to any other documents that staff need to be aware of and 
comply with (e.g., more detailed security policies and procedures as 
well as any other relevant proceedings not directly related to security). 
This could be industry-specific policies such as those businesses that 
need to deal with environmental issues, aspects of health care, pro­
duction of pharmaceutical products or food safety. 
This management information security policy should be written in a 
way that the style and content are independent of any particular skill, pro­
cess or technical knowledge. For example, the content should be under­
standable by someone that is not an IT specialist, someone not trained in 
company finances or legal affairs or does not have human resources skills. 
In other words, it should state information security objectives that are gen­
erally understood by all staff not just people with highly technical back­
grounds or certain professional qualifications or skills. 
5.1.1  Approval, Communication and Awareness
This management policy needs to be approved and signed by the CEO (or 
someone of similar management authority and accountable status), since 
the aim is to indicate management commitment and support. 
The policy needs to be communicated across the organisation to all staff 
and interested parties. This could be in paper form or by electronic means 
or both. Some organisations display their policies on the walls of offices, 
computer rooms and other areas to ensure they are continually accessible 
and visible. Other organisations resort to using ICT to distribute and have 

5.2  Leadership 
63
available their policies and procedures via their internal network. Others 
may choose to distribute it in paper only for staff to keep at their own place 
of work. Whatever the method used, the policy should not be hidden away 
and forgotten. Staff need to read, understand, and refresh their memories 
every so often about its contents and what it says about their specific infor­
mation security responsibilities and duties.
5.1.2  Policy Review
This policy needs to be reviewed and updated as necessary to take account 
of the changing nature of the information security risk environment and 
evolving organisational developments and changes. There needs to be a 
review process for maintaining this policy, as is the case with all policies and 
procedures, as part of the ISMS continual improvement process.
5.1.3  Management Policy Sets the Scene
This management policy is a high-level policy that “sets the scene,” and typ­
ically there will more detailed policies (that will be covered in Chapter 7), 
which will give more specific rules and instructions on the implementation 
of information security protection. For example, policies on access control 
cover the rules of access to different organisational resources and facili­
ties such email servers, databases, network services, applications as well as 
physical access to buildings, offices, rooms and storage equipment.  
5.2  Leadership
Demonstrating leadership in regard to the ISMS is a core aspect of the ISO/
IEC 27001 standard. It is essential that top management provide the appro­
priate level of leadership in terms of direction, authority, policy, governance 
and organisation. Good leadership defines the business purpose of informa­
tion security, creates the mission statement, sets the strategy, provides staff 
focus on what is important with regard to the information security for the 
business and what the priorities are, motivates and inspires confidence and 
trust in the workforce that it is committed to protecting the business and 
nurtures security culture and security skills. 
Good ISMS leadership is needed to build a team that will successfully 
take forward the implementation of the ISMS, which will empower and 
motivate staff to be proactive followers and supporters in helping to protect 
the organisation. A good ISMS leader will be passionate about being suc­
cessful in managing the information security risks the organisation faces. 
ISMS leadership should strive to inspire others to see information security 

64 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
as a business enabler, with the vision of turning information security risks 
into a business opportunity.
Leadership is different than management—the former motivates and 
inspires, creates the vision and points people in the right direction, while 
the latter administers, controls and follows the vision and organizes people. 
Both ISMS leadership and ISMS management together achieve an effective, 
robust, resilient ISMS. Leadership will be the champion of the ISMS, and 
management will control and manage the ISMS. 
5.3  Roles and Responsibilities
Day-to-day working and operational activities functioning effectively, and 
the proper management of staff, at all levels throughout the organisation, 
can contribute to an effective information security business environment. 
In part, this requires a good information security culture within the organi­
sation to be in place, with appropriate awareness and understanding of the 
problems of information security risks and clear lines of responsibility and 
accountability.
It is essential that roles and responsibilities for protecting specific types 
of information or information systems or for carrying out specific infor­
mation security–related processes are clearly defined and allocated. For 
example:

 The owner of an information system should be given the information 
security responsibility and accountability for that system (of course, 
these owners may delegate that day-to-day implementation of security 
to another individual or to a service provider, but they remain ulti­
mately accountable for the protection of the system and the manage­
ment of the information security risks);

 Personal data manager;

 Business owner—a specific department/group (ensures implementa­
tion of policy and procedures, defines information usage and classifica­
tion for information in their custody, allocates information custodians, 
defines access roles and privileges, conducts staff training and aware­
ness and provides protection of personal data under their control);

 Chief information security officer (CISO); 

 Information security incident response team;

 Business continuity manager;

 Internal auditors;

5.4  Resources 
65

 Human resource manager;

 IT services manager (IT service management, IT disaster recovery, 
involvement in incident management);

 IT and network administrators/managers (network management, se­
cure network technologies, involvement in incident management);

 Authorised users of information systems.
In addition, all staff will have general responsibility of information se­
curity related to their day-to-day work. For example, reporting of unusual 
or suspicious behaviour either related to their use of IT, network services or 
related to other staff or visitors. Also all individual staff needs to be aware 
of their responsibility for keeping their passwords and other types of access 
codes secure, to ensure that they are using organisational resources in ac­
cordance with the acceptable usage policy (e.g., rules for using email for 
sending file attachments). 
5.4  Resources
As with any successful business venture, it is important to have the right 
types of resources for the jobs that need to be done. Having staff with the 
right competence to do a job properly, efficiently and effectively is key to 
the overall success of the business. If it is a technical job, then the staff in­
volved need to have the right level of knowledge and skill to handle tech­
nical requirements of job at hand, to resolve technical problems and to be 
able to use techniques, methods, equipment and procedures relevant to 
the technical area in question. If it’s a customer service job, then the staff 
involved must have the relevant skills needed to deal with customers (e.g., 
they are able to listen and respond effectively to customer’s questions and 
queries, they are able to satisfactorily resolve customer queries and prob­
lems, follow up on feedback from customers and generally be able to meet 
the expectations of the organisation’s customers). 
Management needs to ensure that for specific information security 
tasks, it has the right people, with the right skills and knowledge and expe­
rience. This can mean recruiting people who have the right existing skills 
and experience or recruiting people and providing a training programme 
for them to develop the right skills and experience. In addition, all staff 
working in the field of information security, whether those with experi­
ence or those in training, need to keep up to date as the issues and risks in 
information security continually evolve, as does technology and business 
practices. 

66 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
Every organisation strives to have human resources with certain core 
competence, and many organisations seek staff with information security 
skills. The market is expanding, becoming more buoyant and becoming 
highly competitive. For many years, organisations have recruited informa­
tion security personnel with hands-on experience, practical knowledge and 
appropriate references. Even though this is still the general basis of recruit­
ment, more and more organisations have started to request applicants have 
market proven professional qualifications, personal certifications and in 
some cases university qualifications or a combination of both.
The current education and training market provides certified qualifica­
tions, for example, in areas such as: 

 Information security auditing;

 Information security management; 

 Risk management;

 Information assurance;

 Governance;

 IT security;

 Physical security.
Many universities around the world are now offering information se­
curity and IT security modules as part of Bachelor of Science degrees, some 
are offering Masters of Science degrees in information security, and some 
run PhD programmes in information security research.
The market for information security education and training is growing 
rapidly, which is a reflection of the increased awareness of the risks and the 
importance of protecting information. This trend means that in the near fu­
ture, organisations will have access to a greater number of human resources 
with professional qualifications to complement the practical on-the-job ex­
perience and skills needed from information security practitioners.
5.5  Training and Awareness
The organisation needs to ensure that staff are aware of information secu­
rity risks and have sufficient understanding to support the organisation’s 
information security policy to undertake their normal work functions and 
tasks. Staff should be trained in the use of information security policies and 
procedures, security controls applicable to their job function and the correct 

5.5  Training and Awareness 
67
use of IT (e.g., log in procedures, keeping passwords safe, appropriate use 
of IT).
5.5.1  When Should Training Take Place?

 Induction training for new staff upon joining the organisation. This 
should cover the company’s information security policies, procedures 
and routine practices, whom to contact for help and support regarding 
information security matters and whom to report security problems to, 
initial familiarisation with the common types of risk malware, hack­
ing, protection of commercially sensitive information and the protec­
tion of personal data, fraud, use of email and so on.

 On-the-job training providing specifically tailored instructions on in­
formation security suited to the individual’s job function.

 Annual (or more frequent) refresher training to keep staff up to date 
with new developments and to provide organisationwide reminders or 
more immediate remedial training as the result of a security incident 
or an emerging risk.
5.5.2  Training Methods
An organisation can deploy a variety of methods to deliver effective infor­
mation security awareness and training to its staff. The methods that an 
organisation selects will depend on the business culture and its operation­
al needs. Therefore, an information security awareness and training pro­
gramme should be tailored to the specifics of the organisation. You should 
alternate between different methods, perhaps introducing an element of 
motivational instruction together with practical interactivity.

 Classroom-based training can be highly interactive—such training 
can vary from half-day/one-day induction/beginners training course, 
through to various intermediate/advance three-to-five-day training 
courses covering a range of specific topics.

 Computer-based/online web-based training and awareness is a good 
method for reinforcing information security principles and specific 
topics. Such training can be delivered as a set of modules, interactive 
or noninteractive, and be accessible to staff at a time and place con­
venient to the individual.

68 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 Seminars, workshops, round-table discussions and presentations are 
especially well suited for introducing new subject matter and for or­
ganisations with multiple sites;

 Videos are also an effective way to provide training on various topics.

 Posters provide visual reinforcement of information security principles 
and specific topics.

 On-the-job/des-top training is available.

 Internal emails can be used to remind, reinforce and provide updates 
on organisational policies and procedures.
5.5.3  ISMS-Related Topics
Implementing the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 covers many different 
tasks, activities and processes that need to be carried out, and these are as­
sociated with a number of specific topics that information security profes­
sionals, practitioners and other staff will need to have knowledge of and 
develop experience in, depending on their particular job function. For ex­
ample, an internal ISMS auditor will require knowledge of the auditing pro­
cess and methods, whereas an ISMS risk manager would need knowledge 
and skills of the principles of risk management. These include:

 Principles of risk management (e.g., as found in ISO/IEC 27005, NIST 
SP 800-30, -37, and -39):

 Risk assessment;

 Risk treatment.

 Information security controls:

 Generic controls (e.g., as found in ISO/IEC 27002, NIST SP 800 
…);

 Sector-specific controls (e.g., as found in ISO/IEC 27010, 27011, 
27015, 27017, 27018, 27019).

 Performance evaluations:

 Measuring and monitoring methods and techniques (e.g., as 
found in ISO/IEC 27004);

 ISMS auditing process and methods (e.g., as found in ISO 19011 
and ISO/IEC 27007).

 Certification and auditing:

 Certification (e.g., as found in ISO/IEC 27006, ISO 17021);

6.1  Determining the Controls
6.1.1  Control Framework 
As mentioned in Chapter 4 (“Managing the 
Risks”) of this book, the 2013 version of ISO/
IEC 27001 retains the general principles of risk 
treatment specified in the 2005 version—deter­
mine an option or options for risk treatment; 
identify, determine or select controls; produce a 
statement of applicability; produce a risk treat­
ment plan; gain approval and sign-off of plan 
and residual risks. There is, however, a major 
specific difference, and that concerns the secu­
rity controls used in the risk treatment process 
between the 2005 version and 2013 version of 
the standard. In the 2005 version, the controls 
were selected from Annex A of the standard; 
however, in the 2013 version controls are not 
selected from Annex A, but determined (Section 
6.1.3) by design or identified from other sourc­
es (e.g., codes of practice, industry standards, 

72 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
sector-specific standards). This change in emphasis from the selection of 
Annex A controls to determining controls from any source provides greater 
flexibility and choice for organisations. Annex A is still retained in the stan­
dard, but its function and purpose has changed. Its purpose in the 2013 edi­
tion of the standard is as a benchmark to check that the controls that have 
been determined, by design or identified from other sources, to cover as a 
minimum the set of baseline controls addressed in Annex A. If there are 
controls in Annex A that are not included in the set of determined controls, 
then justification why they have not been identified for implementation 
needs to be given. 
6.1.2  Process of Determining a Control Set 
Controls to implement the risk treatment option are selected based on their 
capability of modifying risks. For example, a control or a set of controls in 
combination may be used to prevent, detect, reduce or correct the unde­
sirable effects of an information security incident, breach or compromise. 
Controls that are used to prevent an information security incident include 
those controls that reduce the likelihood of the incident occurring in the 
first place. For example, installation of malware detection software can be 
used to prevent infection of IT systems and subsequent loss, damage or 
destruction of information. A well-written and properly deployed disaster 
recovery plan and procedure can reduce the consequences/impact on the 
organisation in the event of a disaster. 
Some controls are able to detect indications that an information se­
curity incident or attack is about to occur. If such detected indications are 
effectively acted upon in a timely manner, they can reduce the potential 
impact of the attack. In some cases, they can stop the attack from occurring 
in the first place.
If the knowledge gained from an employee information security aware­
ness and training programme is properly put into practice by employees in 
their everyday jobs, this contributes to reducing the likelihood and impact 
of an attack. For example, if employees know when, how and why they 
need to report about potential events that might be a precursor or an in­
dicator of an information security attack or incident, then this helps in the 
analysis and response, which subsequently can help in reducing the poten­
tial impact of the attack. Equally if employees know what to do to protect 
the sensitive information they are processing by following a company pro­
cedure that gives instructions of how to protect such information, then they 
are contributing to reducing the likelihood that sensitive information will 
be leaked or stolen.

6.2  System of Controls 
73
So in determining the controls needed to (a) reduce the consequences 
and/or (b) the likelihood of the risk, account needs to be taken of the extent 
that the control:

 Reduces the likelihood of a risk-related ISMS attack, incident or event 
occurring (which can mean reducing or removing the weaknesses or 
vulnerabilities in the business systems or processes, improving the 
effectiveness of a control to prevent an information security incident 
from being realized);

 Reduces the consequences or impacts of an attack, incident or event 
(which can mean implementing controls that will react to an infor­
mation security incident that is happening or is expected to happen 
to limit or reduce the consequences of the incident or correcting the 
effects and impacts of an information security incident);

 Detects and responds to precursors and indicators of an attack, inci­
dent or event;

 Implements preventative actions against the future occurrence of an 
attack, incident or event;

 Implements corrective actions to remove the cause of a past attack, 
incident or event.
6.1.3  Existing Control Sets
In determining which controls are needed to modify the risks identified in 
the risk assessment process, it is also important to take into account any 
existing controls. Any system of controls needs to work together, and so it 
is necessary to understand what controls already exist and what role and 
effect they have in modifying the risk. It is also important to check whether 
any new controls that are planned for implementation conflict with the 
existing set, whether there is redundancy or how effectively will they work 
together and interwork.
6.2  System of Controls
6.2.1  Control Framework 
Controls are determined as part of the risk treatment process on the ba­
sis that they are able to modify the risks identified in the risk assessment 
process. Controls can be of many forms such as policies and procedures, 
processes, plans or techniques. It is important to bear in mind that ISO/

74 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
IEC 27001 is a management system standard and the object of protection 
is information, so the controls are management-oriented controls not IT 
controls, as this standard is not an IT security standard. 
Figure 6.1 shows a typical system of controls.

6.3  Policies and Procedures
6.3.1  General 
Information security policies can either be a high level of policy or a more 
in-depth level of policy. ISO/IEC 27001 (clause 5.2) specifically refers to top 
management policy; this is typically a high-level policy. An organisation 

6.3  Policies and Procedures 
77
may also have policies and procedures at different levels of detail targeted 
at specific topics such as (a) mobile device policies, (b) access control poli­
cies, (c) clear desk policies, (d) backup policies and (e) policies on the use of 
cryptographic controls.
The top management information security policy (ISO/IEC 27001 
clause 5.2) is intended to be a high-level directive and mission statement 
appropriate to the organisation and its business. Such a policy includes the 
information security objectives, a commitment to satisfy the requirements 
of interested parties (ISO/IEC 27001 clause 4.1 and 4.2) and an undertaking 
to continual improvement of the ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001 clause 10).
This information security policy should be written in a way that the 
style and content are independent of any particular skill, specialist or tech­
nical knowledge; it should also be communicated to all in the organisa­
tion and to other interested parties as and where appropriate. The content 
should be understandable by someone that is not a specialist (e.g., someone 
who is not trained in company finances or does not have human resources 
skills). In other words, it should state information security objectives that 
are generally understood by all staff, not just those with a highly technical 
background or certain professional qualifications or skills. 
The length of the documented policy (number of pages) is not specified 
in the standard. Some organisations produce such policies of between one 
and three pages, others may decide to produce a policy that is greater in 
length and volume of text. It is up to the organisation to decide the length, 
volume and detail of text in its policy commensurate with its business ob­
jectives, strategy and culture. What is more important is that it contains 
enough information to convey in a clear way the objectives and ideas re­
ferred to earlier.
The broader aspects of information security policy at all levels of detail 
should be to:

 Provide a clear definition of the scope of information security, em­
phasize its importance to the business, and clarify what the business 
information security objectives are (e.g., regarding the confidentiality, 
integrity and availability of its information);

 Make staff aware of their duties and responsibilities regarding protect­
ing the information the organisation has control over (e.g., their re­
sponsibility to handle and process company restricted and confidence 
in way that protect it from compromise); 

 Set out what is acceptable and not acceptable with regard to behaviour 
and use of its resources (e.g., acceptable use of the company email 
system);

78 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 Make clear its obligations to carry out its business in compliance with 
the laws and regulations, contractual obligations, best practices and 
standards with which staff also need to comply (e.g., compliance with 
laws on copyright, data privacy/protection and computer use/misuse/
abuse); 

 Give reference to any other policy documents that staff need to be 
aware of and comply with (e.g., more detailed security policies and 
procedures as well as any other relevant proceedings not necessarily 
directly related to security). This could be industry-specific policies 
such as those businesses that need to deal with environmental issues, 
aspects of health care, production of pharmaceutical products, or food 
safety. 
6.3.2  Approval, Communications and Awareness 
Information security policies and procedures need to be approved and 
signed by someone of management standing, who has the authority and is 
of accountable status. This achieves one of the aims of information security 
policy (i.e., to indicate management commitment and support). 
Information security policies and procedures should be communicated 
to all staff. Some organisations display their policies on the walls of offices, 
computer rooms and other areas to ensure they are continually accessible 
and visible. Many organisations today resort to using electronic means to 
distribute and have available their policies and procedures via their internal 
network. Others choose to distribute in paper only for staff to keep at their 
own place of work. Whatever the method used the policy should not be 
hidden away and forgotten. 
Staff must not only be aware of the policy, but also understand its con­
tent and what is says about their specific information security responsibili­
ties and duties. Staff must read, understand and refresh their understanding 
on a regular basis the contents of policies and procedures.
6.3.3  Review 
Like most things in business, there will be changes such as how the organi­
sation operates and how it does its business. Therefore, changes should be 
reflected in the information security policy. A review should be made of the 
policy whenever it is most appropriate, possibly after identifying changes to 
the business, after an incident or as part of a regular management review on 
its ISMS (ISO/IEC 27001 clause 9.3).

6.4.1  Overview
This section provides some examples of policy and procedural controls. 
These examples provide details of what might typically be included in the 
policy and procedural controls. The examples are not the finished prod­
uct of such controls; they are merely examples and should be read and 
considered as such. The finished product would need to be customized to 
the organisation itself and its requirements and objectives. In some cases 
(e.g., the acceptable use policy), the organisation would need to have the 
wording of such policies and procedures be produced by management and 
checked by legal experts and human resources, as the content and wording 
of such policies will depend upon the jurisdiction of the country in which 
they are used applied. Additional information on operational controls, such 
as backup processes, information security incident management procedures 
and business continuity plans, will be given in Chapter 8.
6.4.2  Acceptable Use Policy
6.4.2.1  Basic Idea
Many organisations do allow their staff to have access to the Internet for 
personal use as a goodwill gesture to improve employee relations. In such 
cases, as well as the general use of an organisation’s assets and resources 
for business, it is a very good idea to put in place an acceptable use policy 
(AUP) with regard to the use of the organisation’s resources—in particu­
lar, its IT systems that are deployed for email, Internet access and services. 
The AUP policy is addressed in ISO/IEC 27001 A.8.1.3 under Assessment 
Management. 
The basic intent of such a policy would be to protect the organisation, 
its staff and management, its business partners and its customers and sup­
pliers from individuals involved in any illegal, incriminating and/or dam­
aging actions, whether knowingly or unknowingly. The consequences of 
such actions could expose the organisation and its staff, business partners, 
customers and suppliers to a range of risks, impacts and possibly civil and 
criminal legal proceedings, actions and lawsuits. 
The following is a word of caution regarding the content of the AUP. An 
organisation that does not explicitly state what is not acceptable and what 
is prohibited might face some staff relations issues. For example, a member 
of staff is dismissed for unacceptable use of the Internet for personal use. 
The organisation faces the risk that the member of staff takes legal action for 
unfair dismissal and is claiming compensation since the activities they were 
engaged in were not expressly prohibited. It is always good practice to make 

80 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
it clear to staff that access to the Internet and email facilities for personal 
use is a privilege and not a right. Legal and human resource advice on the 
content of such a policy needs to be sought.
6.4.2.2  General Policy Provisions
In producing this type of policy, the following are some notes should be 
considered. The policy should:

 Apply to all levels of staff, as well as contractors, consultants and other 
individuals the organisation might employ on a short-term or tempo­
rary basis;

 Provide a clear definition of what is considered personal use, including 
information on how much access time is acceptable and when person­
al access is allowed, as well as expressly stating that the user should 
exercise good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use; 

 Provide a clear warning of what is strictly forbidden and prohibited, 
including the following:

 Accessing pornographic or indecent websites and downloading 
material from these web sites;

 Using chat rooms or online messaging services for the exchange 
of information, comments or opinions that are sexist, racist or 
any that will cause offence, and this includes which the use of 
offensive and indecent language;

 Any activities or transactions that are fraudulent or meant to 
deceive, or where the user masquerades as another user;

 Any activities or behaviour that might provide unauthorised 
access to other organisations’ information, their systems and the 
network services they use, as well as causing disruption or denial 
of services or damage to or loss of information or processing 
resources.

 Provide warnings regarding the need to comply with any copyright, 
digital rights and licensing requirements and restrictions related to ma­
terial on web sites;

 Provide instructions regarding the downloading of material from 
the Internet, including the cautionary measures to be taken to avoid 
downloading malicious code such as viruses, worms and Trojan horses 
and similar executable programs;

 Provide a clear statement of what disciplinary actions are to be taken if 
staff do not comply with the policy;

6.4  Example controls 
81

 State what the organisation’s rules regarding its right to audit and 
monitor networks and systems on a regular or periodic basis. Staff 
should be advised that their access to the Internet and use of email 
may be monitored in accordance with the laws in whatever jurisdic­
tion the organisation operates. 
A note of what this might include might be useful to staff as a caution­
ary measure. For example, the fact that websites that have been used can 
be traced, the frequency of times they were accessed and time spent at such 
sites will appear in an audit trail, as well as the situation regarding using the 
Internet resources for personal transactions (e.g., online banking, bookings 
and orders). Consultation with legal and human resource personnel should 
be engaged in the production of these types of policies.
6.4.2.3  Specific Policy Provisions
These might include the following:

 Warning users not to reveal their account password to others or al­
lowing use of your account by others, which includes those outside of 
the organisation such as family or friends in the case of a laptop being 
used offsite; 

 Warning users to make statements regarding warranties, licences or 
any other statements that might legally commit the organisation, 
expressly or implied, unless it is a part of the user’s normal job duties 
and prior authorisation to carry out this action has been given; 

 Reflecting the organisation’s requirements for protecting the informa­
tion that staff create on their systems and what is deemed to be the 
acceptable (and legal) use of encryption for information that is consid­
ered sensitive or especially vulnerable;

 Monitoring and/or intercepting a communication network or service 
for the purpose of intercepting data (unless, of course, this activity is a 
part of their job function and prior authorisation has been given and it 
is allowed in the jurisdictions covered by these activities). For exam­
ple, the UK Regulatory Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) law covers 
some such activities. 
6.4.2.4  Travel Company Case Study
The following is a sample policy of that used by the Travel Company. Use of 
this policy will require an organisation to customize the contexts to match 

82 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
their own requirements and legal obligations and liabilities. Policies such as 
this one should always be checked by someone that has some knowledge 
of the law and contracts, especially since what is in this example may not 
match the business rules and requirements such as the use of emails for 
personal use.
6.4.3  Information Handling Policy and Procedures
6.4.3.1  Basic Idea
The aim of these procedures for information security is to ensure that all 
staff know what they should do to handle information in way that protects 
its confidentiality, integrity and availability—whether it is the processing, 
storage and archiving, distribution, copying or disposal of information.
6.4.3.2  Information Management
Ownership, Accountability and Third-Party Custodianship
Information that is generated and/or created using the organisation’s re­
sources (money, staff, ICT systems and other information, especially that 
owned by the organisation) is generally deemed to be the organisation’s 
property, and the organisation becomes the owner. As the ultimate respon­
sibility for all of the organisation’s assets are the senior executives and direc­
tors and CEOs, they are accountable for this information. 
Often responsibility for the day-to-day management of the informa­
tion is delegated down to particular groups, departments, functional units 
and/or individuals within the organisation. Custodians within these groups 
are then given individual operational responsibilities of being the “owner/
custodian,” which means they need to manage these assets and to ensure 
they are afforded an appropriate level of protection. In the area of data pro­
tection with the roles of data controller and data user, both these roles are 
associated with different information responsibilities. It might also be the 
case that information is managed and processed by an outsourcing contract 
to a third party. In all cases of delegation, custodianship and outsourcing 
the ultimate accountability of these assets rests with the directors and ex­
ecutives, and it is their responsibility to ensure their safe keeping and the 
organisation’s well being.
Use and Misuse of Information
The ISMS involves an ongoing process of practicing the right things to do 
for the business with due care and diligence to protect information from a 
range of threats and risks. This means that staff must use the organisation’s 

6.4  Example controls 
83
Travel Company Email Use Policy
1. Scope and Objectives 
1.1 The purpose and objective of this policy is to prevent damaging the image of 
the Travel Company. 
1.2 This policy covers appropriate use of any email sent from the Travel Com­
pany email address and applies to all employees, service providers and agents 
operating on behalf of the company.
2. Policy
Prohibited Use: The Travel Company email system shall not to be used for the 
creation or distribution of any disruptive or offensive messages, including offen­
sive comments about someone’s race, gender, religion, disabilities or age. Also 
prohibited is the use of emails of a sexual and pornographic nature, religious 
and/or political beliefs. Staff that receives any emails of this type from any other 
member of staff or from outside sources should report the matter to their man­
ager immediately. 
Personal Use: The Travel Company allows a reasonable amount its email re­
sources to be used for personal use as long as such use does not interfere with 
the user’s normal work tasks and the company’s day-to-day operations and cus­
tomer services. Any nonwork-related emails, and attachments, shall be saved in 
a separate folder from work-related email. However, the sending of chain letters 
or joke emails from the Travel Company email account is prohibited. Any mail­
ings sent via a distribution list from the Travel Company shall be approved by 
the head of the Travel Company operations. These restrictions also apply to the 
forwarding of mail received by a Travel Company member of staff.
3. Monitoring Email Usage
The travel company reserves the right to monitor email system usage and to 
check anything that is stored, sent or received via the email system without 
prior notice. Therefore members of staff should not expect any privacy protec­
tion from the company’s email system. 
4. Disciplinary Action 
Any member of staff violating this policy may be subject to disciplinary action. 
Depending on the severity of the resulting security policy violation the action 
may include the termination of employment.

information and resources in an acceptable and proper way to avoid secu­
rity comprises and/or legal complications and actions (see Section 6.4.2).
Information Classification
Information should be graded appropriately according to its level of sensi­
tivity and/or criticality. This enables an organisation to be able to deploy the 
right amount of protection for the information commensurate with these 
sensitivity levels. There are many names and levels of grading that can be 
assigned to information. 
6.4.3.3  Information Gathering, Creation and Processing
Gathering and Collecting
Gathering and collecting information is a normal function of most organisa­
tions. This may be through market research, research on customer activities 
(types of spending, seasonal fluctuations), customer surveys and feedback 
and other forms of research. There are some legal, contractual and secu­
rity implications about collecting information which organisations should 
be aware of and pay attention to. The most prominent one of course is 
personal data: what can be collected, what be done with this data and what 
controls are needed to protect it against abuse or misuse. Another area of 
attention is intellectual propriety and copyright related to both electronic 
and nonelectronic information and digital rights, digital rights management 
(DRM) and the rights of individuals.
Processing Efficacy, Effectiveness, Efficiency and Correctness
The activities of processing information can mean many things, but all have 
information security requirements to ensure the confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of information is preserved. This means doing the “right” 
things at the “right” time (efficacy of processing), getting these things done 
(efficiency of processing) and doing these things “right” (effectiveness of 
processing). 
Most information that an organisation processes is vital to its business, 
whether it is processing customer orders, accounts and statements, online 
transactions (buying and selling products), formal company accounts and 
tax records or other business processes. It is important to get it right to avoid 
losing money, time, productivity, credibility and possibly customers through 
incorrect data entry and processing of this data and subsequent results with 
mistakes and errors. Some of these problems are caused by human error, 
lack of training in using processing applications, software flaws, system 

6.4  Example controls 
85
malfunctions and failures, data corruption and data loss or unauthorised 
modification.
It is estimated that a high proportion of business losses and security 
compromises result from the people who handle information. The correct 
processing of information is a major area of security problems resulting in 
customer dissatisfaction, business losses, inefficient and ineffective business 
operations as well as legal action for failure to honour contracts or to be 
compliant with legislation.
Offsite Processing
Some information and data might be processed offsite, such as a member 
of staff using a laptop to process information whilst out on business at a cli­
ent’s office, at home or in a public place. A managed services company, un­
der an outsourcing contract, might process the information. Whatever the 
business case, the protection of this information during processing should 
be afforded at least the same level of protection as it would receive onsite. 
6.4.3.4  Information Storage
Electronic
With today’s technology, organisations and users have many ways of stor­
ing information:

 Network servers; 

 Hard drives (internal and external); 

 Optical disks (e.g., CDs and DVDs); 

 Flash memory devices (e.g., USB sticks, SD cards, memory cards), 
CompactFlash cards;

 Tablets, iPads, iPods and MP3 players, and other similar technologies.
Whatever means and methods of storage are used, security should be ad­
dressed: ensuring that confidential information is protected to prevent un­
authorized disclosure, that the integrity of the information remains intact 
(i.e., does not get changed, modified or flawed whilst in storage) and that 
the information is available to all who need it. A clear policy needs to be 
established on what protection measures need to be in place to protect its 
confidentiality, integrity and availability. The more sensitive and/or criti­

86 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
cal information should be stored using memory segmentation or paging, 
cryptographic technology and/or a strong access control system.
Paper Based
Information in paper-based form requires just as much attention as infor­
mation in electronic form. This should include:

 Physically protecting sensitive and/or critical information by locking 
papers, documents and reports in lockable filing cabinets, desk draw­
ers or in safes to reduce the risk to an appropriate level, as well as 
providing  standard physical security to building, offices and rooms;

 Physical separation of papers having different information classifica­
tion;

 A clear desk policy should be established to ensure papers and docu­
ments are put away when unattended;

 Papers and documents should be protected from physical or environ­
mental threats and damage (e.g.,fire, water).

 Papers and documents kept offsite should have the same level of 
physical protection. 
Onsite and/or Offsite
The decision of whether information should be accessed and stored onsite 
or offsite depends on the circumstances of the organisation. Sometimes off­
site storage is a better option, as it may afford a better level of risk manage­
ment. Management must take into account the cost of such storage and the 
availability and convenience of accessibility to such storage. Offsite storage 
should always have the same level of protection as that given to onsite 
storage.
Information might be looked after by a managed services company that 
stores and processes information on behalf of the organisation. Access to 
this information is facilitated by use of networking.
6.4.3.5  Information Sharing, Exchange and Distribution 
Electronic
With today’s technology, organisations and users have many ways of dis­
tributing information. Users can push information out (such as podcasting, 
broadcasting or server-push) to recipients or have it available on a network 

6.4  Example controls 
87
to enable recipients to pull the information down from a website or server. 
Whatever means and methods are used, security should be addressed so 
that: 

 Distribution of sensitive and/or critical information is kept to a mini­
mum, and the information should be clearly marked to indicate its 
classification;

 Confidential information is protected to prevent unauthorised disclo­
sure or interception; 

 The integrity of the information is prioritised to ensure the informa­
tion does not get changed, modified or flawed whilst on route; 

 The information is available to all those that need it; 

 A clear policy is established on what types of information can be sent 
electronically (e.g., via email and email attachments) and what protec­
tion measures need to be in place to protect the more sensitive and/or 
critical information; 

 If confidential information can be sent by those with the right level of 
authorisation, then cryptographic technology is used;

 The use of anonymous re-mailers and other technologies should be 
forbidden. 
Fax
Today fax machines are very much less in use than they were 10 years ago; 
however, for those organisations still using such technology, care needs to 
be taken since sending information by fax machines can sometimes cause 
security problems.

 Make sure steps are taken to ensure faxes are indeed delivered to 
the right destination. It is common for a sender to type in the wrong 
telephone number or hit the redial button, and the fax arrives at the 
wrong place.

  If sending sensitive business information, also make sure the fax ma­
chine is physically secure, that an authorized person is attending the 
machine as the fax comes through and have the person telephone or 
email to confirm that the fax has been securely received and the cor­
rect number of pages has come through.

88 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
Post and Courier Services
When sending information by post or by courier services, there needs be a 
clear policy stating what types of sensitive and/or critical information can be 
sent and the means and methods for doing this:

 Information at the highest level of sensitivity should use the technique 
of double enveloping, with the outer envelope not indicating the clas­
sification of the contents but the inner enveloped marked; 

 It is generally accepted practice that envelopes containing restricted 
information could be sent in an single envelope as long as it doesn’t 
indicate the classification marking but is marked with the words “to be 
opened by the addressee only”;

 The use of tamper-proof containers or boxes, or such containers that 
make it obvious that an attempt at access has been made;

 Using registered or recorded mail services;

 Using trustworthy and accredited couriers.
6.4.3.6  Information Destruction
Erasure and Deletion of Information from IT Systems
Once information has gone past its “sell by date” and no longer needs to be 
kept, it should be deleted and/or destroyed from the system.

 Electronic files and folders on PCs, laptops and servers should be delet­
ed. This can be done using the standard operating system commands 
or application functions or by using an appropriate piece of software 
technology that wipes clean the information.

 A word of caution: although most systems have a delete command, 
the information is not actually deleted—only the link to the directory 
system is actually deleted or disconnected, which means it still is possi­
ble to recover part or all of the information if you know how to locate 
in the system. There are ways of improving this situation other than 
by physical destruction of the storage media.

 Deletion of information should also apply to all copies as well as back­
ups of the information.

 Having an orderly file directory system helps to facilitate deletion of 
files and any copies or backups.

6.4  Example controls 
89

 The asset inventory should be revised to record the deletion of infor­
mation.
Disposal of Hardware and Storage Media
Disposal of IT systems poses the problem of information contained in their 
memory systems.
Disposal of Paper-Based Information
Again, as with electronic information, once paper documents and files have 
gone past there “sell by date” and no longer needs to be kept, they should 
be suitably disposed of.

 Paper documents, reports and other paper-based information should 
be appropriately destroyed using approved shredding or other physical 
destruction methods and technology (e.g., burning, pulping).

 Destruction of paper documents should be carried out by a trusted 
person or an approved external organisation.

 Copies and backups of all information being disposed of should also be 
destroyed.
6.4.3.7  Information Backups
Identification of Information to Be Backed Up
All information should be backed up one way or another. Care should be 
taken to back up information on staff PCs and laptops, information on serv­
ers and on other IT equipment. 
Methods of Backups
How, when and where backups need to be done must be defined. Back­
ups can be done centrally using a network of one or more servers, servers 
at a specific department level or locally at a user’s computer. The policy 
should define which information applies to which type of backup. For ex­
ample, operational information is commonly done via a central network 
server, whereas locally processed information might be done on someone’s 
PC or external hard drive or memory device. It must not be forgotten that 
it is not only electronic information needs to be backed up, but also paper-
based information systems since all information systems, IT or non-IT, suf­
fer from the risk of physical or environment damage or loss as well as theft.

90 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
How frequently backups should be made should be related to the criticality 
value or level of the information. Daily overnight backups are quite com­
mon in many organisations, especially the large ones. End-of-week backups 
should be the norm and may be combined with the daily overnight process. 
Backups need to be done often and regularly, and the more often the better, 
within reasons of practicality. The more time information is left not backed 
up, the more risk the organisations run of it being lost or damaged.
Protection of Backups
Critical and/or sensitive information should be:

 Secured to protect its confidentiality and integrity with the use of 
cryptographic technology or strong access controls;

 Physically protected to ensure the integrity and availability of the 
information.
Testing Restored Backups
There should be a procedure to make sure the backup process and sys­
tem is working properly and the backed up information can be read and 
is a faithful copy of the original. A good maxim to remember is that your 
backed up information is only as good as your ability to restore/recover the 
information from its backed up state without it being corrupted or lost in 
any way. What follows from this is that the system and media you are using 
for backups must be of a good quality and the process of restoration needs 
to work properly. If you can’t restore your valuable business or customer 
information to its original state, then it was not worth the time to back it up 
in the first place. Testing the backup system should be done if there are any 
changes to the backup process and/or business environment using this pro­
cess. Testing the process should be undertaken on a regular basis, regardless 
of whether or not there have been any changes. It is better to find out how 
good your backup and restoration process is before a major disaster or inci­
dent happens than find out later that it does not work properly—always be 
ready and prepared before an incident not after. 
Storage
Storage of the backups is another issue that needs to be addressed by the 
policy. The normal best practice for this is to store the backups offsite some­
where away from where server and processing of the information takes 
place. The reasons should be quite clear: if such backups are kept on the 

6.4  Example controls 
91
same site, then they face the same risks the originals are subject to (e.g., 
damage and loss by office fires, physical destruction, theft and other threats). 
Hence, backup means not only back up the information but also back up 
the information somewhere else. 
Store some backups away from home (or offsite) in case your backup 
data gets stolen or damaged along with the computer it is backing up.
Storage Media
The type of media used for backups is also another policy issue. There are 
many types of media for this purpose, including tapes, DVDs/CDs, USB 
sticks, SD cards and other removable memory devices as well as removable 
or external hard drives. 
Backup Records
Accurate records should be kept of what is backed up, where the backups 
are kept, date/times and other information that might be necessary for in­
cidents, disasters and system failures, as well as for auditing purposes and 
other information-handing processes.
6.4.3.8  Information Records Management
Records
Keeping records is an important feature of management systems, including 
ISO/IEC 27001. Records provide a vital link between past events and activi­
ties, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the ISMS to preserve informa­
tion security and to manage the organisation’s risks.
Retaining or Archiving Information
Certain documents an organisation has will need to be kept for a certain pe­
riod of time as required by law, such as tax records and company accounts. 
For documents outside of the legal and regulatory categories, an organi­
sation may have both business and technical reasons for the retention of 
information, such as:

 Protecting its IPR, trade secrets, and research results;

 Audit trails, system and network configuration files and other records, 
especially if they are required to be used as part of an incident han­
dling or a forensic and/or criminal investigation.

Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
6.4.4  Access Control Policy, Procedures and Processes
6.4.4.1 Basic Idea
Access control is a very broad subject and encompasses various types of 
methods and means of access such as having:

 The rights and means of access to enter buildings, offices and compu­
ter rooms;

 The right, privilege or opportunity of access to use or deploy some­
thing like an IT system;

 The right, means and ability of access to approach, see or talk with 
someone such as might the case with using the organisation’s IT re­
sources including laptops for online telephone calls and video messag­
ing;

 The right and means of access to act on and/or process information 
(i.e., obtain, retrieve, copy, store or destroy to prevent unauthorized 
access or accidental damage to or compromise of information);

 The ability to be reached, such as having access via a mobile comput­
ing device.
Access is given to information and organisational resources to enable 
staff to carry out their particular job functions. Hence, access should not 
be given to specific information if it is not necessary for the conduct of the 
staff’s official business duties. Normally the “principle of least privilege” is 
used to grant users/staff permissions they need to do their jobs, thus not 
providing additional permissions that are not necessary to minimise the risk 
of compromise. This principle should not be mistaken for the other prin­
ciple of segregation or separation of duties, even though this later principle 
employs the idea of giving limited or least privileges. 
Of course, this does not mean compromises will not occur with those 
users that have been given access permissions and rights, as there is always 
the case of those authorised to have access doing damage to the system 
and its contents. This can be the case with insider trading, staff involved 
in internal fraud, theft by staff and other incidents where the culprits did 
have authorisation. Hence ISMS measures need to protect against those 
not having sufficient access rights and permissions and those owners of the 
information to control those that do. 
Although access control is primarily about ingress—the rights, permis­
sions and privileges to gain entry—there is also a dual protection aspect, 
and that is the egress situation where information exiting from a building or 
system does not leave in a condition that could be compromised. 

6.4  Example controls 
93
It is important from the word go to have a clear understanding of the 
business requirements for access: access to what and by whom and the 
means of gaining access. What are the requirements for access to the dif­
ferent information systems the organisation has? Are there requirements 
for access to different applications and processes? What are the physical ac­
cess requirements for staff, contractors, maintenance engineers or visitors? 
How is access control to be implemented regarding IT-based information 
systems? At the technical/IT implementation level, access falls under par­
ticular policies—mandatory access control (MAC) and discretionary access 
control (DAC). MAC policy is centrally controlled by a system administra­
tor, whereas DAC policy is generally controlled by users.  
6.4.4.2  Access Rights and Information Classifications
The organisation needs to decide what access rights are given to informa­
tion and by whom. Some may be given access to information at different 
levels of classification. Staff will be given access to information that is on a 
“need-to-know” basis. 
The higher the classification (most sensitive information), the smaller 
the group that has need-to-know rights; hence, the biggest group of us­
ers would be those having access to “restricted” information (less sensitive) 
(Table 6.1).
In addition, information can further classified (e.g., a confidential mark­
ing might have a caveat attached to it such as in Table 6.2).
In addition to need-to-know rights, which are a means of allow users 
to read information, there are also need-to-modify rights, which give users 
permission to modify, delete and/or generally create information. 
An example of these different types of access is that referred to as read 
and write access. There are, of course, other access rights, such as the right 
to be able to execute a particular piece of software code. Table 6.3 shows 
Table 6.1

Confidence

senior management, or available to a group in the organisation with a 
specific job function such as finance, human resources, research and 
development)
Restricted
Information that is not available to the public but is generally available 
internally to all employees or staff

policies. Some applications do not offer all these options or restrictions.
6.4.4.3  Authorisation, Accountability and Ownership
At a management system level, it is normal policy and good security prac­
tice for information (system or process) to have an owner. This owner is 
responsible for making sure that the information they are responsible for 
as owner is adequately and suitably protected. Thus, the owner is account­
able for ensuring they have appropriately classified the information, they 
have compiled an information asset inventory and they will ensure the 
necessary and appropriate control measures and actions are taken to pro­
tect the information at the defined information classification. They need to 
ensure that such protection is implemented in order to manage the risks

to this information. The technical implementation of access control is, of 
course, outside of the scope of ISO/IEC 27001. Authorisation for access is 
also another management aspect of ownership of information: authorisa­
tion granting or denying access and the appropriate access rights.
The information owner might be, for example, an individual who is 
head of a group, unit, department or division of an organisation.
6.4.4.4  User Access Registration and Deregistration Process
The implementation of access control does have many variants depending 
on the type of access, the methods of access and the technology being used. 
There are, however, some common elements that should be considered 
when producing access control procedures. 
The overall process should start by registering the user onto the system 
and then setting up an account from it. Once this has been established, the 
user can use the account to access resources on the system according to the 
rights and permissions they have been given. This also applies to the access 
of services (e.g., telecommunication services and Internet services). 
The management and maintenance of access policy and procedures; the 
rights, permissions and privileges; the control measures and methods for ac­
cess—these are not necessarily trivial and can sometimes prove to be quite 
an administrative burden with large overhead, if not managed correctly, es­
pecially in large organisation with thousands of users and system accounts. 
Systematic, properly implemented ISMS processes and the effective 
deployment of ISMS measures can reduce this workload. From the point 
when a user is first registered and given an account on the system until the 
time when that account is cancelled and the user’s access rights need to be 
revoked, there needs to be management measures in place to ensure the ac­
cess process is secure, effective and robust. This process involves a number 
of measures, both nontechnical and technical, all of which should work in 
harmony and without compromise. 
6.4.4.5  User Access Termination Process
Once employment has finished or has been terminated, or there has been 
any change in employment, a number of internal security-related activities 
need to take place and be enforced regarding user access (see also Section 
6.4.5). This applies to the termination of employment of full-time staff as 
well as contractors. Such activities include, but are not limited to:

 Return of organisation assets (e.g., IT equipment, mobile phones and 
other devices belong to the organisation; information; documents, 
files);

96 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 Removal of access rights and privileges;

 Enforcement of ongoing legal responsibilities contained in confidenti­
ality agreements and terms and conditions of employment continuing 
for a defined period after termination.
Requirements regarding the termination of employment related to se­
curity aspects should be addressed in the contract of employment. Similarly 
with third-party contractors and agency staff, security requirements regard­
ing termination should be included in their contracts.
6.4.5  Human Resource Policies, Procedures and Processes
6.4.5.1  Basic Idea
An organisation’s human resources (or personnel) group is generally there 
to recruit, develop and utilizes its personnel for the purposes of meeting the 
organisation’s operational and business needs.
It has been shown many times through work experiences that the big­
gest threat to information systems originates from people. The people threat 
could be accidental (e.g., errors in entering customer information into an 
ordering system or the unintentional deletion of files on a PC) or inten­
tional (e.g., the abuse of organisational ICT systems for personal gain or de­
struction of critical data as might be the case with a disgruntled employee). 
There are three important stages to consider in the life-cycle of em­
ployment: (i) recruitment (Table 6.4), (ii) during employment (Table 6.5), 
and (iii) termination of employment (Table 6.6). Therefore, management 
should focus its efforts on getting the people aspect of information security 
right and management commitment and leadership to properly and appro­
priately address these three stages.
6.4.5.2  Training and Awareness
Information security training must achieve not only knowledge transfer 
and understanding security policies and procedures, but should also aim at 
getting staff involvement and commitment to adopting the procedures. But 
just knowing the procedures without practice does not modify the risk of 
loss or damage to the organisation’s information. Some specific information 
security training and awareness aspects (the content of which should be as a 
minimum: the information security and business risks, rules and guidelines, 
roles and responsibilities and commercial and legal aspects), include:

Recruitment Activities
Activity
Commentary
Recruitment
The human resources group is responsible for facilitating the recruitment 
of the right people to fit job vacancies. Defining employee skills, qualities 
and competence is an organisationally determined aspect. In the area of 
information security, there are some specialist jobs such as a security officer/
manager, risk manager and IT security expert. In addition, there will be 
staff that are not specialists but will need to know about, and how to use, 
information security policies and procedures in their day-to-day work.
Screening
This process involves assessing the applicant’s suitability for the job 
advertised. This normally involves screening applications based on their 
work experience, skills and training for the described job. This normally 
involves a two-/three-stage process. Screening comes first at a general level 
(e.g., reviewing applications, requesting a CV), then may be followed at 
a secondary level by getting letters of reference from previous employers 
and from educational establishments or certificates as proof of their 
qualifications). Depending on the type of job being applied for, further 
screening stage might need to be carried out. For example, for some 
security-specific jobs may require more detailed assessment of their previous 
work and/or social background. This could go as far as checking whether the 
individual has a criminal record or checking their financial state by doing a 
credit reference check.
Interviews
Like most recruitment drives, the interview activity is a critical part of the 
process involving the human resources group, representatives from the 
department involved in the vacancies and the candidates themselves. The 
more detailed screening process normally comes after the interview relating 
only to those that have been sort listed. 
Signing 
documents
The new employee will be expected to sign a contract of employment with 
the employer’s terms and conditions. They will also be asked to sign a 
nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement, as well as various forms for their 
salary payments and whatever security forms are deemed necessary (e.g., an 
acceptable use policy).

During Employment Activities 
Activity
Commentary
Employee 
responsibilities 
Staff will be assigned certain roles, responsibilities and duties during 
their employment, which are related to the organisation’s information 
security policies and procedures. These include general security duties and 
responsibilities as well as more specific security duties and responsibilities.
Employee 
system account 
During employment users would normally be given a system account to 
allow them to access the organisation’s IT systems and networks. What 
they can access and what rights they have to read, write, print, copy or 
execute files on the system will largely depend on their specific job role. It 
is good practice for the human resource group to keep a record of this on 
their system.
Provision of 
training 
Staff needs to be given training according to their job functions and needs. 
The objective of this should be to provide: 
Awareness of information security and risks; 
Instruction on how to use security-related policies and procedures;
Skills for career development.
Training can take various forms, such as on-the-job training, formal 
training courses, online training and at the desk self-instruction using 
training software.  
Review of 
training
As business needs change, staff development and/or staff get moved to 
different job functions and/or responsibilities and training needs will likely 
change. This will entail reviewing staff training, providing additional or 
new training and updating the staff records. It is important that staff keep 
up to date with the organisation’s developments in information security.
Disciplinary 
process 
Security compromises involving staff can require disciplinary action 
depending on the severity of the incident.
Legal 
representation
Some information security incidents can involve civil or criminal activities. 
Members of staff who are named as being the perpetrators or being 
involved in any way could face legal action against them as individuals and 
possible action against the organisation itself.

a set of controls that will help in modifying the identified risks (ISO/IEC 
27001 Clause 6.1.3 b)).

Termination of Employment Activities
Activity
Commentary
Termination 
responsibilities 
Staff employment gets terminated for various reasons: (a) voluntary 
termination (e.g., if the member of staff wants to move or they need to 
move for domestic reasons) or (b) involuntary termination such as being 
fired for disciplinary reasons or being laid off. For these different types of 
circumstances, the responsibility of the handling of the termination of staff 
employment should be assigned to someone in the organisation’s human 
resources group with the appropriate seniority level. This role should 
involve making sure the process is handled correctly to ensure that all 
business, legal and personal issues are concluded in a proper and effective 
way appropriate to the circumstances of the termination. 
Some terminations can be the result of disciplinary action and a severely 
disgruntled employee with bitter feelings toward the organisation. This type 
of situations need to be handled sensitivity and with extreme caution, with 
cognizance  of what damage the employee might cause before leaving. 
In some organisations, employees are asked to the leave the premises 
immediately without serving the normal period of notice if there is a risk of 
a security compromise. 
Return of 
assets 
Staff is normally expected to return all assets that belong to the 
organisation. This should especially be the case with all computing 
equipment, storage devices, software and applications as well a paper 
documents, files, reports, manuals and/or procedures containing 
the organisation’s information, in particular that which is sensitive, 
confidential, restricted or related to personnel. 
Removal of 
access 
To avoid the risk of unauthorized access to buildings, offices and rooms, 
pass cards, identity cards and other devices should be collected from the 
member of staff. Also any physical entry PIN codes should be removed from 
the system.
All access accounts to information systems, in the name of the member of 
staff, should be removed from the system. This is to avoid unauthorized 
access by the ex-member of staff or a colleague or accomplice at a later 
date. This applies to all ICT equipment from system servers, PCs, laptops, 
mobile service accounts and any other devices that allow a user to gain 
access to the organisation’s information.

6.6  Benchmarking with ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Annex A
The set of controls that has been determined according to ISO/IEC 27001 
Clause 6.1.3 b are then checked against the list of controls given in Annex 
A of ISO/IEC 27001 to see whether any control areas or controls have been 
overlooked. This is merely a benchmarking exercise and not a replacement 
for the determination of controls exercise. 
Even if there are controls in Annex A that have not been determined 
as necessary, this does not mean that they need to be added to the list of 
controls to be implemented. On the other hand, there may be controls that 
have been overlooked, and consideration should be given as to whether 
they should be implemented. In all cases any controls that are not included 
in the implementation list but appear in Annex A do need some justifica­
tion as to why they are not included.

ISMS Operations 
7.1  Operational ISMS Procedures
7.1.1  General
As indicated in Chapter 6, there are several 
types of procedures that an organisation might 
need to have in place to protect its day-to-day 
operations. The operational procedures used 
by the organisation will be unique to it and its 
business operations. Operational procedures 
are generally detailed, written instructions to 
achieve a consistent level of information secu­
rity performance of a specific function, process 
or operation within the ISMS scope. They are 
deployed to assist and ensure a level of infor­
mation security commensurate with the level 
of identified risk.
7.1.2  Example Procedures
There may be operational procedures that are 
standard across the organisation, and some pro­
cedures may be specific to certain departments 
(e.g., call-centre procedures detailing the in­
formation security controls to be deployed by 

102 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
call-centre staff). The following are some of the procedures that an organi­
sation needs to consider for implementation:

 Acceptable use policy and procedures;

 Access control policy and procedures;

 Backup procedures;

 Business continuity procedures;

 Call-centre procedures;

 Capacity planning procedures;

 Change control procedures;

 Communications and reporting procedures;

 Information handling procedures;

 Information security incident procedures;

 Malware procedures;

 Monitoring procedures;

 Recruitment procedures;

 PII procedures;

 Procedures related to secure operational areas;

 Service management procedures; 

 Software maintenance procedures.
7.1.3  Training, Awareness and Usage
It is essential that the organisation’s management not only makes employ­
ees aware of the procedures that are applicable to the job role and function, 
but also arranges for employees to have some form of training in the use of 
these procedures. A new recruit could easily compromise the information 
security of the organisation by making errors or doing the wrong things by 
lack of understanding and knowledge about the correct security procedures 
to follow in their day-to-day job. This may not just happen to new recruits, 
but also employees that have been in the organisation for a while may need 
to use a new procedure or a revised version of an existing procedure. In all 

7.2  Ongoing Risk Management 
103
cases the same applies, a lack of understanding and know-how can lead to 
an incident and hence compromise information security of the organisation. 
It is also important that all employees use the procedures provided by 
the organisation to ensure consistency and the intended performance. If 
employees use their own methods of doing things in an operational envi­
ronment, then this could not only compromise the information security of 
the organisation and its systems, processes and services, it would be against 
the organisation’s policy and rules and could be rewarded with disciplinary 
action. Finally employees using nonstandard procedures are likely to result 
in a nonconformity being given in an audit. We should remember that a 
well-written procedure would be generally designed to achieve the most ef­
fective level of information security, and so the instructions should be care­
fully thought out and written in a way that will achieve this level. So a non­
standard procedure used by some employee may not only fail to achieve 
this level, but would be against the organisation’s policy and wishes. 
7.2  Ongoing Risk Management
A risk assessment is always just a snapshot in time based on the perceived 
risks and impacts at the time the assessment was carried out. There should 
be no doubt that business conditions will change, and with this the risks 
and impacts related to the organisation will change. So it is imperative that 
the organisation keeps up to date with its risk profile by reassessing its risks 
and impacts on a regular basis. What is regular depends on several factors 
including:

 Whether the organisation is operating in a dynamic environment, in 
which case it is most likely subject to frequent changes in business 
conditions—vitality of the market, its growth rate, its diversity and 
other variable conditions;

 The complexity of the organisation—in terms of processing resources; 
the volume, type and nature of information involved; the number in­
terfaces and dependencies it needs to manage and take account of and 
so on; these are some of the risk factors and risks it needs to consider;

 If the nature of the organisation’s business places it in the front line 
for attack, then the frequency of attack would be higher.
There is no set standard time for reassessing its risks and impacts. Some 
organisations do a reassessment every three to six months; some leave 
it to nine months—the actual frequency can only be determined by the 

104 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
organisation itself. It should be management that decides the frequency. In 
addition to a regular programme of risk assessments, then there will always 
be the chance that a risk-assessment needs to be carried out sooner than 
the next scheduled risk assessment. This might be after a major information 
security incident, a major system disaster, a major change in the organisa­
tion circumstances, or a management review (see Chapter 8) or ISMS audit 
(either an internal or an external certification audit—see Chapter 10). An 
organisation should implement a change management process (see Section 
7.4.4) that includes information security aspects. 
7.3  Operational Threats 
7.3.1  Malware
7.3.1.1  General 
Malware attacks are worldwide headline catching news. The virus is an 
example of a piece of malware or malicious software that is designed to 
infiltrate or damage a computer system. This class of software also includes 
worms, Trojan horses, spyware and adware, to name but a few pieces of 
malicious software code.
Malicious code is one case of those pieces of software that is designed 
specifically to do damage and harm, and put organisations infected with 
such code at risk. As is well known by many cases, viruses once in the sys­
tem attach themselves to applications software, then replicate and spread 
themselves very fast like a fire in a forest that has not seen rain for weeks 
or months. In their path through the system, they cause destruction and 
damage just like the fire. Even when they have been discovered. they may 
not be immediately eradicated—just like a fire that taken hold of the for­
est, extinguishing the flames might take sometime. So for a period of time, 
the virus is out of control. The virus might be deleting files, damaging soft­
ware programs and applications and may even be aimed at reformatting the 
hard disk. Even the more benign types of viruses can cause the organisation 
problems since continual replication of the virus can eat up memory, trigger 
erratic behaviour and maybe make the system crash—all resulting in degra­
dation of performance and possible a denial of service.
The worm is a self-replicating piece of software code that does not at­
tach itself to an application, but nevertheless causes widespread damage 
across networks such as the Internet. Since it is self-replicating it eats up 
network bandwidth, consuming computer system memory, slowing down 
systems and in the worst case causing a widespread denial of service attack. 
Worms such as the “Morris Worm” of 1988 cause global disruption and cha­
os to many systems connected to the Internet at the time the worm invades 

7.3  Operational Threats  
105
these systems. Several of the worms that are released onto the Internet 
only replicate and spread themselves; however, some worms have been 
produced to carry “payloads,” such as to delete files, send files via email to 
other systems, install “back doors” in systems and even encrypt files. The 
back-door problem can result in an opportunity for the attacker to cre­
ate a “zombie computer” within the infected system. When similar zombie 
computers are networked together to form a “botnet,” which subsequently 
can be used by those responsible for sending spam, they can create several 
security incidents.
The Trojan horse is a piece of software code that contains and/or installs 
a piece of malicious code into a system. This piece of malicious code is often 
called a payload or simply a Trojan. These Trojan horses might appear as 
useful and harmless pieces of software, but beneath the surface lurks the 
malicious code that, when the seemingly useful piece of software is execut­
ed, triggers a sequence of damaging events. The Trojan horse can cause a 
lot of unauthorised activities to occur on the victims’ systems without their 
knowledge or consent such as:

 Downloading and uploading files from the Internet;

 Sending out emails using the victim’s email address book, including 
the distribution of spam;

 Phishing in the victim’s files to gain access to credit and banking de­
tails;

 Causing the system to restart;

 Attaching the system to a botnet;

 Deleting and corrupting files.
Trojan horses can infect systems in several ways such as via an email at­
tachment or by a user downloading a file from a rogue site on the Internet.
7.3.1.2  Managing the Problem
Protection from malware needs proper management processes and controls 
in place. For a start, the organisation should produce a policy prohibiting 
the use of unauthorised software and then implement controls to prevent 
or detect the use of such software. The organisation should also have a 
policy regarding the downloading or receiving of files and software.
A set of procedures should be produced by the organisation for how 
to deal with and report malware problems. Responsibilities for dealing 

106 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
with malware should also be defined, and this should be included in these 
procedures. Staff should be trained in how to deal with malware.
The organisation should conduct regular audits on the software that 
supports their critical systems and processes. Such exercises should search 
for the existence of any unapproved files or software. 
The organisation should implement software that is capable of detecting 
malware on computer systems and media. This type of software should be 
capable of scanning files, email attachments or web pages for the presence 
of malware infections. There are a number of commercial products on the 
market for this purpose. The functional capability of these products does 
vary: generally they are designed to detect, prevent and eradicate malware 
from computer systems and other IT devices. They generally scan the sys­
tems files and folders located on hard drives and other memory devices. The 
malware software relies on a dictionary of known pieces of malware to com­
pare against when scanning the system. The effectiveness of this software 
relies on keeping the dictionary up to date: most product vendors have an 
online facility to provide live updates. Of course, this live update needs to be 
done on a regular basis—at least once a week, if not several times a week. It 
is a good idea to set your system to do an automatic update. 
As a word of caution, the malware code writers always try to stay one 
step ahead of the vendors by using various techniques to disguise the mal­
ware to circumvent the dictionary match process. 
Of course payloads such as those attached to Trojan horses are more 
difficult to protect against. Most of these are delivered by email, and there 
are some email best practice measures that could help: 

 Being alert to emails that are received from someone that the user 
does not know or that has suspicious or unknown attachments;

 Set the email preferences to not automatically open attachments;

 Update the antivirus software automatically;

 Update the operating system with the latest patches.
7.3.2  Unauthorised Access
7.3.2.1  General 
Unauthorised access to information can lead to disclosure, modification or 
unauthorised use of the information. Such access might happen as a result 
of an internal compromise of organisational policy and abuse of privilege, or 
it might occur as a result of someone externally breaking through organisa­
tions security systems. Unauthorised access to information might occur by 

7.3  Operational Threats  
107
breaking through layers of physical protection or electronic protection, or a 
combination of both. Of course, access via the Internet or other network is 
a common problem. Whatever the means and method of access, once the 
unauthorised person has gained access to the organisation’s information, 
they have an opportunity to steal, modify or destroy this information. 
Depending on the type of information being accessed (sensitive, critical 
or personal), then the organisation may be facing a range of problems. For 
example, if the unauthorised person has gained access to customer details 
including passwords, PINs, or bank account details and sells or publishes 
these details online, then the organisation faces commercial and legal prob­
lems. Another example might be the unauthorised person that gains access 
to critical information that controls an industrial process and the same per­
son modifies the information or takes control of the process—this could be 
a serious safety problem as well as potential commercial and legal problem. 
An unauthorised access attempt might be from an outsider (e.g,. a 
hacker, competitor, industrial spy) trying to break into the organisation’s 
system and gain access or it might be an attempt by an insider abusing their 
privileges or using their inside knowledge of the organisation to gain access 
to areas of the organisation they have not been given access to. 
7.3.2.2  Managing the Problem
The problem of unauthorised access to information can be managed at dif­
ferent levels. The organisation should have an access control policy, and it 
should have specific procedures for different access control methods and for 
covering different types of access (e.g.,access to information, applications, 
processes, IT and networks). The control methods implemented to manage 
access should be strong enough to prevent unauthorised access. Control of 
these methods and the information used for gaining access needs proper 
management and administration. Controls need to be in place relating to 
who has access, for what purpose and to what information is access given, 
via what devices can access be made: establishing authorized computer, 
system and network accounts, password and privilege management, access 
restrictions, reviews of access rights, disciplinary action regarding abuse of 
rights and training of users on access control methods, rights and privileges. 
7.3.3  Insider Threat
7.3.3.1  General 
The insider threat is a malicious threat to an organisation, which is becom­
ing more and more a common occurrence. Such a threat could be from 
current staff and employees from within the organisation, but it might also 
be from ex-employees or even contractors or business associates that are 

108 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
working closely with the organisation and have certain internal access priv­
ileges because of the nature of the work and collaborative ventures they are 
involved in. 
The insiders, employees or members of staff will have computer ac­
counts given to them for legitimate, work-related purposes to undertake 
their job function and work-related duties. This means they already have 
some level of authorised access to computer systems to carry out certain 
job-related tasks, unlike the outsider who does not have such access (the 
case of the onsite contractor is different, and they may be given some access 
rights). The insider may abuse or misuse these privileges and cause harm or 
damage to the organisation. In addition, the insider generally has far more 
knowledge, experience and familiarity with the workings of the organisa­
tion: where things are, who does what, how things operate, the strengths 
and weaknesses of the organisation, the rules and procedures. With this 
inside knowledge of the organisation and the privileges they have, the in­
sider has much more scope for attacking the organisation and being success­
ful than the outsider, although we should not underestimate or ignore the 
power of the outside threat. Hence, it easier for the insider than the outsider 
to circumvent any information security the organisation has in place. 
Some of the insider attacks are for personal gain; others are for revenge. 
Both of these cases are intentional and deliberate attacks. On the other 
hand, an insider threat might be due to user error or mistakes (i.e., acciden­
tal or unintentional).
A member of staff might be using the organisation’s resources for their 
own personal gain: running their own private business for monetary profit, 
selling commercial information to the organisation’s competitors, commit­
ting fraudulent transactions, stealing intellectual property, selling stocks 
and shares and so on. 
A member of staff may be disgruntled and unhappy with their work­
ing conditions or feel that management or their peers have treated them 
unfairly. In this case, they might take out their dissatisfaction or anger re­
garding their situation by damaging system resources, deleting or corrupt­
ing information, leaking information, destroying files, deliberately upset­
ting customers, obstructing and disrupting normal business operations and 
other acts of sabotage against the organisation.
7.3.3.2  Managing the Problem
The insider problem can be managed at different levels, with a combination 
of the following:

 Policies and procedures—include instructions and information regard­
ing insider threat;

7.3  Operational Threats  
109

 Training—include insider threat awareness into staff training;

 Recruitment process—check employment references, check for past 
criminal offences, review reports of suspicious or disruptive behaviour;

 Personnel management—manage conflicts; resolve disputes in the 
work environment; review working conditions of disgruntled staff; 
provide counseling and dispute resolution opportunities for disgrun­
tled staff; be vigilant to unusual behavior and watch for unusual work 
patterns against what the organisation defines as standard, work-relat­
ed activities and patterns of normal work operations;

 Ensure the risk assessment and risk treatment takes account of the 
insider threat problem;

 Termination of employment—implement a secure employee termina­
tion process;

 Implement controls for separation of duties and least privilege; enforce 
strict password practices; ensure secure backup and recovery proc­
esses; implement effective change control procedures;

 Access control—implement strict access controls; enforce strict access 
restrictions; ensure effective management of privileged users, includ­
ing effective monitoring, logging and audit of system access; impose 
restrictions on remote access; review access rights; 

 Online activities—be vigilant to online employees behaviour; manage 
usage of online services such as social networking through acceptable 
use policy;

 Enforce an appropriate policy and procedures for BYOD;

 System vulnerabilities—keep the door closed to unauthorized access 
and exploitation of system vulnerabilities by fixing, repairing and safe­
guarding against system vulnerabilities.
7.3.4  System Availability
7.3.4.1  General 
If the organisation wants to keep its business running and to operate produc­
tively, then it needs to ensure the resources it needs to do so are available. 
This includes all types of resource: people, information, processes, services, 
networks, IT and facilities. A factor in this is how reliable, for example, is 
the organisation’s network in providing for its operational needs? Does the 
network fail? Does it slow down? Does it provide for 24x7 uninterrupted 

110 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
usage? The backbone of most businesses is that of IT. The organisation might 
suffer from a poor record of IT system failures. Why? Is it lack of adequate 
maintenance, failure to install the latest software upgrades and patches, or 
is it that the demand for a specific IT system far outweighs its capacity to 
deliver against these demands?
If an organisation’s IT system fails or its online presence is interrupted, 
it could suffer many hours of downtime, which translates into impacts such 
as loss of revenue, loss of customer confidence and possibly penalties due to 
a breach of contractual obligations if the loss of availability stops the organi­
sation from being unable to honour such obligations.
Organisations can improve their chances of having the resources they 
need available as and when they need these resources. In particular, it is the 
resources that provide, processes and support its information, as well as the 
availability of its information that is the main issue. 
In the case of IT and network resources, it is a case of regular mainte­
nance and testing of these resources to lower the chances of IT system fail­
ures and outages, network service disruptions and protecting these resourc­
es from attack (e.g., a denial of service attack ,which can overload, slow 
down and generally disable systems and their ability to function normally). 
This is particularly the case with software maintenance, upgrades, patches 
and vulnerability testing, but can also apply to the hardware.  
7.3.4.2  Managing the Problem
The availability problem can be managed at different levels including the 
following:

 Information—protecting information from unauthorised disclosure or 
modification, access to information, backups of information, informa­
tion recovery in the event of a system failure, procedures for handling 
information, ownership of information assets and authorisation to 
access information; 

 Services—management of service delivery, service provider contracts 
and SLAs, managing the connections to services, access and usage of 
services (e.g., networks, web services, managed security services, dis­
aster recover services, outsourced services, teleworking services, media 
disposal) and authorisation to access services; 

 IT system usage—effective access controls, restrictions of usage to 
avoid misuse, policy for acceptable use and procedures for correct use, 
secure processing of information using IT, employee terms and condi­
tions on the use of IT, network services and the handling of informa­
tion, authorisation to access IT systems; 

7.3  Operational Threats  
111

 Software (S/W) management—restrictions on S/W installations and 
usage; control of S/W versions, upgrades and patches; separation of 
private and business use; control of S/W support and maintenance; 
use of default/secure configurations, access to utility versus application 
S/W; restrictions on remote use of S/W, control of S/W licences; sepa­
ration of S/W in operational environments from S/W in development 
and testing environments; malware protection; S/W backups; secure 
control over operation S/W; 

 Vulnerability management—risk assessment and impact analysis of the 
vulnerabilities, understanding and identifying system vulnerabilities, 
assessing and reviewing the vulnerabilities, taking correct or preventa­
tive actions to remove or diminish the weaknesses or to improve 
protection to avoid the chances of exploitation, improvements and 
controls to manage vulnerabilities need to be tested, ensuring S/W 
patches are from an authentic source, assuring the vulnerability proc­
ess works in collaboration with the incident handling (Section 7.5) 
and business continuity processes ( Section 7.6).
7.3.5  Social Engineering
7.3.5.1  General 
Social engineering is a type of information security attack that exploits the 
psychological vulnerabilities of people by manipulating them to perform 
activities that result in divulging information—the “art of hacking into the 
human psyche.” This type of attack can be performed online (e.g., emails, 
phishing attacks, social networking) or offline (e.g., over the phone to ob­
tain information or posing as officials or service technicians to gain access 
to company premises, facilities and information). This attack is a confidence 
trick that aims to obtain information to gain system access to steal commer­
cially sensitive information or to commit a fraud, a scam and so on.  
7.3.5.2  Managing the Problem
The social engineering problem can be managed at different levels including:

 Consideration of social engineering attacks in the risk assessment and 
risk treatment exercises; 

 Identification of information as sensitive, critical or personal, and 
evaluation of the exposure of this information to social engineering 
attacks; 

112 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 Establishment of a policy and procedures for handling social engineer­
ing attacks;

 Employee training to understand the problem of social engineering 
and to recognize situations that might be an indicator of, or precursor 
to, a social engineering attack and understand how to apply company 
policy and procedures to social engineering attacks for protection 
information;

 Occurance of regular audits and reviews of the controls in place to 
counter social engineering attacks—people, processes, procedures and 
access control methods;

 Establishment of  roles and responsibilities for handling sensitive, criti­
cal or personal information;

 Keeping up to date with the latest information on social engineering 
attacks, feeding this information back into the training programme 
and using this information in the revision of policy and procedures. 
7.4  Operational Processes
7.4.1  Protecting Information in the Operational Environment
It is important that the organisation has the necessary management con­
trols in place to support and secure its operations and the information being 
processed during its operations. These controls include the following:

 Procedures for all operational activities associated with the processing 
of information, in particular for the protection of this information;

 Change management processes that cover changes to those business 
processes, systems and services supporting the processing of informa­
tion;

 Capacity planning to ensure that adequate resources are available to 
meet operational requirements;

 Back-up process to protect business and customer information from 
loss;

 Malware protection to protect operational systems against malware 
attacks;

 Separation of business environments (operations versus development 
and testing);

7.4  Operational Processes 
113

 Service management of information security related to service de­
livery, third party services, supply chain management, contracts and 
SLAs;

 Operational monitoring and logs, where controls are needed to moni­
tor and record information security–related events; 

 Operational software protection, where control measures are needed 
to protect operational software;

 Vulnerability management, where control measures are needed to be 
implemented to deal with proper identification, evaluation and resolu­
tion of operational system vulnerabilities;

 Operational audits to assess and verify that the operational environ­
ment is adequately and suitably protected. 
7.4.2  Backups
7.4.2.1  General 
There are two main reasons why backups are required. The first, and most 
important, is to recover information that becomes lost or corrupted due to 
some system failure, disaster or compromise. Many users and organisations 
suffer some sort of loss of information at some point in time; it is a common 
experience shared by many IT users. 
Another reason for backing up is for information retention purposes: to 
enable copies of information to be brought back into the system that were 
created or processed at some earlier time.
7.4.2.2  Policy
A policy should be produced that defines the business requirements for 
backing up the organisation’s information assets. The slogan “back it up 
before your business loses it” is very simple way of illustrating this basic 
requirement. Performing regular information system backups is vital to en­
sure an organisation’s information is adequately protected and preserved 
from damage or loss. The policy should state the business importance of do­
ing backups and the consequential risks that could severely impact business 
operations for failing to implement an effective backup process. This should 
include the risk of exposure to legal proceedings, not being able to respond 
to customer orders and supplier payments, deliveries being cancelled or 
production lines being halted or running inefficiently. On the other side of 
the coin, having a good backup system enables the organisation to operate 

114 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
normally—to continue trading and supplying customers with services and/
or products even if the original information has been damaged or lost.
7.4.2.3  Roles and Responsibilities
Information owners are accountable for the safe and secure protection of 
that information. Of course, the deployment of risk controls to provide such 
protection may be delegated to others for practical purposes, but the owner 
still remains accountable. It should be made clear that it is essential that all 
information that is processed by all departments, operational groups and 
staff, whether they are owners or custodians of information assets, should 
be the subject of regular backups.
Much of the information an organisation has and processes is indis­
pensable for it to do its business. Also, the organisation needs to take re­
sponsibility for all of the information it handles, even when the information 
owner is another organisation or its customers/clients. The consequences of 
loss of information or its destruction or damage can have severe commercial 
and financial consequences as well as dire legal implications so back it up 
before your business loses it is a clear and simple message. 
7.4.2.4  The Technology Is Available; Use It!
Backups can be implemented in many different ways, and today’s technol­
ogy makes the process relatively easy. There many pieces of commercial 
software and types of storage media (hard disk, magnetic tape, optical disk, 
solid state, remote storage) that can be used as backup facilities. 
7.4.2.5  Managed Backup Services
One option that some organisations consider is the use of managed back­
up services. There are, of course, advantages and disadvantages with this 
approach:

 Advantages include that the organisation uses less of its resources im­
plementing and managing backups, it uses less time keeping up with 
the advances in technology and the maintenance of ICT for backups, 
it can reduce the organisation’s risk of data loss due to lack of focus 
under operational pressures, human error and/or accidents, it reduces 
the day to day responsibilities of backups and it provides a way of 
achieving the automatic availability of offsite storage for added protec­
tion;

 The main disadvantage includes that the organisation is entrusting its 
information assets and the management of the risk to a third party 

7.4  Operational Processes 
115
and not to internal staff or another part of its organisation. the li­
abilities this entrustment might entail must be weighed, as at the end 
of the day the organisation is still accountable for these information 
assets, which could involve information owned by its customers or 
suppliers and certainly could contain personal data. 
If this is the option that the organisation selects, then careful consider­
ation needs to be given to the managed service contract and SLA to ensure 
the organisation is adequately and suitably protected.
7.4.2.6  Backup Processes
In developing best practice, the following questions should be considered 
when a process for backing-up information is being decided:

 What are the organisation’s objectives for backups?

 Who is responsible for the backup process? 

 When are backups carried out? 

 How is the storage of the information to be organized and managed? 
What storage media should be used?

 What are the recovery objectives? For example, what is the desired 
time objective between the disaster occurring and the recovery and 
restoring of information in the system? 

 What are the performance requirements?

 What are the arrangements for the backup process to be tested to 
check the validity of the recovery of information?

 Are backups kept secure and offsite from the main business premises? 

 Do staff receive some training in doing backups to safeguard their 
essential information on their own computers, which are not backed 
up centrally, as well as knowledge on how to use the central backup 
system as per the backup procedures, if necessary and appropriate?

 Is there a need for backups to be encrypted and/or password protected 
to ensure their confidentiality, integrity and availability?

7.4.3  Capacity Planning
In the context of information security management, capacity planning is 
the process of identifying the current and predicted future demands of sys­
tem resources to ensure that the organisation has sufficient capacity to do 
its business in a productive, efficient and effective way. The objective of 
capacity planning is to avoid the problems of overloads and reduction of 
performance levels due to the lack of capacity commensurate with the de­
mands of users and customers. Capacity planning helps to minimize this 
discrepancy between capacity and demands.
An organisation’s information processing and/or networking demands 
will and do vary due to various reasons: 

 Extending the processing operations of the business (e.g., due to in­
crease in sales and production, increase in the customer base, expand­
ing use of supply chains); 

 Additions or modifications to the current Internet services it offers 
and/or its outsourcing services;

 The introduction of new working practices and/or methods of process­
ing such as allowing more staff to work from home and giving them 
more remote access; 

 New computer systems being networked together or new networks 
being included;

 Redeployment of staff or large increase in the staff count.
The term capacity, for the purposes of capacity planning, can be taken 
to mean, for example, the amount of information processing power and 
capability that an organisation needs in a given period of time, the amount 
of email traffic or the volume of Internet transactions an organisation needs 
to engage in over a period of time. 
Capacity planning is essential to ensure that the organisation has suf­
ficient capacity to meet the demands of business operations and to avoid 
problems such as lack of resource availability, system overloads, down times 
or degradation in system processing capability. Capacity planning is an im­
portant and critical management control in any risk management strategy 
and one that needs to be attended to and reviewed on a regular basis. The 
ISO/IEC 27001 best practice control A.12.1.3 addresses the issue of capacity 
management.

7.4  Operational Processes 
117
7.4.4  Change Management
Change management, for the purposes of this chapter, covers changes to 
those business processes, systems and services that support the processing 
of information in an operational environment. Our concern here is the im­
pact that any change might have on information security in the operational 
environment. A change management process should be in place that identi­
fies the change, assesses the potential impact of the change, ensures formal 
agreement to the change after reviewing the potential impact and takes 
the necessary actions to implement the agreed change. Add to this that 
the change management process should take into account any information 
security concerns, requirements, risks and impacts related to the proposed 
change and verify that any implementation of the change meets these in­
formation security aspects. 
Of course, there are many types of change that the organisation might 
need to consider, either following an internal requirement or as a result of 
an external requirement, such as changes relating to:

 Business mergers; downsizing or expansions; increases in staff levels;

 New business processes; deploying new ways and methods of working;

 Adoption of new technology; integrating new systems with legacy 
systems; deploying new network services;

 Third-party service delivery;

 Supply chains;

 Contractual obligations;

 New or revised legislation and regulation.
7.4.5  Third-Party Services
7.4.5.1  Addressing Information Security
More and more organisations are using third-party services for various 
business functions and applications. The following are a few of these uses:

 Outsourcing call centres and help desks;

 Managed security services;

 Recruitment of staff taking over from the activity of a human resourc­
es group; 

118 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 Managed data backup and data recovery services;

 Hosting web sites;

 Development of software;

 Recovery of debts; goods relating to unpaid invoices and payments;

 ICT support services.
Whatever the purpose of using external services, it is important that 
the requirements for information security shall be addressed and be the 
subject of contractual and service level agreements. At the core of this is the 
information that is outsourced and processed by third parties and how this 
information is to be protected. The organisation is giving access to the third 
party its information assets—information that might be commercially sensi­
tive, operationally critical or personal data. This arrangement is an example 
of transfer of risk. This arrangement does not, however, obviate the organisa­
tion’s ownership of the information or their responsibility to be accountable 
for the protection of this information. Having said this, there are many busi­
ness benefits to using third-party services. The organisation needs to weigh 
the pros and cons as part of its risk decision-making process.
Considering information security, the organisation should ensure that 
its information assets are given information security measures that are com­
mensurate with the organisation’s business risks and with their business 
interest.
7.4.5.2  Service Agreements
The main aspects that should be considered with third-party suppliers in 
agreeing a service agreement include:

 A clear definition of the security requirements and the security roles, 
responsibilities and obligations of both parties for fulfilling these re­
quirements;

 The process for dealing with information security incidents;

 The access arrangements to ensure the confidentiality and accessibility 
of the organisation’s information assets;

 Backup and business continuity arrangements to ensure the integrity 
and availability of services and of the organisation’s information assets;

 Regular reporting;

 Provisions for management changes; 

7.5  Incident Management 
119

 Right to review and audit the third party’s information security ar­
rangements.
The organisation needs to work with third-party suppliers toward a 
commercially amicable agreement of how to deal with the information se­
curity requirements. Clearly, the legal managers on both sides should be 
involved. The third-party supplier is more than likely to have standard con­
tracts and service level agreements in place, which may or may not in­
clude clauses for the provision of information security management. The 
organisation and its legal department will need to review these third-party 
contracts and SLAs to check whether or not they comply with the organisa­
tion’s requirements. 
7.5  Incident Management
7.5.1  Events That Compromise
Information security incidents can cause an organisation’s systems to be 
severely damaged, their work to be significantly interrupted or them to be 
subject to legal action (both civil and criminal). In the worst case, it might 
even threaten their survival as a business.
The range of information security incidents is quite diverse and includes 
any event that could compromise the protection of the organisation’s infor­
mation. This could be an incident caused by someone inside the organisa­
tion (an insider threat) or someone outside, external to the organisation. 
The incident might be caused intentionally or by accident. For example, 
an inexperienced employee using a badly written procedure, the intention 
of which is to give instructions on sending file attachments to email mes­
sages, might cause the incident. The incident might be a system failure or 
malfunction due to lack of proper maintenance, or a virus or other malware 
attack through lack of up-to-date antimalware software. The incident might 
concern a poor access control system, a badly implemented procedure to 
prevent ID theft, a flawed process to prevent fraud or a lack of physical pro­
tection allowing some unauthorised person to enter a secure area. 
The severity of the incident could be minor or major, depending on 
the level of risk and impact involved. Incidents might occur daily, weekly, 
monthly and so on due to their uncertainty, so it is important that the or­
ganisation has a process in place to handle the incident when it might occur. 
All incidents should be dealt with in a timely way, but some incidents are 
more severe than others and they should be given higher priority to resolve. 
The longer an organisation avoids taking appropriate action, the worse the 
problem might become and the greater the resulting cost—timeliness is crit­
ical to protect the organisation.

7.5.2  Use Cases 
7.5.2.1  External Attack Hits a Auto-Industry Supply Chain
A medium-sized auto-engineering supply company is experiencing a num­
ber of external unauthorised attempts to its internal networks. None of 
these were successful, but management was worried by this concentrated 
spate of attacks. Their firewall detecting then followed this and blocked a 
rapid increase in the number of malware-based attempts to penetrate their 
system. At the same time, the company’s email system was being bombard­
ed with a continuous stream of thousands of unwanted emails—enough to 
overload its system. This chain of events further worried management, as it 
seemed that the company was being targeted. Fortunately for the company, 
its incident handling process was able to deter any serious impacts. 
It turned out after consulting with one of their end customers that one 
customer in particular was the main target, and all the customer’s suppliers 
were indirectly targeted to interrupt the supply chain. The incident involved 
the customer’s supply management system being compromised. After many 
weeks of investigation involving the end customer and three of its suppli­
ers, several men were charged with criminal offences, including employees 
from all the companies involved. The impact on all companies involved was 
costly and resource intensive. The media coverage reporting also had an 
impact on the company and its suppliers. 
Finally, over a period of time, the situation got back to near normal and 
the company started building back the confidence and loyalty of its custom­
ers. All those involved learnt many lessons in handling this supply chain 
incident and should help them in avoiding future incidents such as this. 
7.5.2.2  Down Tools on the Production Line
A medium-sized company producing a range of electronic components is 
hit by a spate of system problems. Their design and production line are 
highly dependent on the use of CAD/CAM applications for design work and 
automated assembly and testing facilities. The processes seemed to become 
erratic, unreliable and produce faulty results, which slowed down produc­
tivity and on two occasions the complete system had to be restarted. 
The company’s incident team was assembled to resolve the problem. 
In collecting all relevant information about these incidents, they discov­
ered the problem seemed to be related to few new customized application 
software packages that had been deployed two months ago but had never 
been tested before being used in an operational environment. The supplier 
of this software was immediately contacted and asked to solve this problem. 
Over the next 24 hours, software engineers found a number of bugs in the 

7.5  Incident Management 
121
software products and produces several patches to resolve the issue. The 
customer tested these and found them now to be functioning as intended. 
The company got back into to its normal operational working and pro­
ductivity after three days of down time. Since then, several improvements 
have been made to its information security and software management 
controls. 
7.5.2.3  Online Services Company
The Online Services company has recently introduced a strict Internet Us­
age Policy to improve staff productivity and customer service, and to direct 
staff to spend less time surfing the Internet for personal reasons during busy 
times in the office. This seemed to work for a short period of time, but 
then a small group of staff became disgruntled and at odds with manage­
ment. Shortly afterwards, the company seemed to experience an increase in 
the number of unauthorised access attempts during the first two weekends 
in March. There was also an increase in the number of internally sourced 
blocked viruses.
On inspecting the Internet usage records, the company noticed that a 
pattern between blocking external access attempts and internal access at­
tempts. More detailed analysis of other monitoring records kept by the or­
ganisation showed that those attempting internal access were those same 
people that expressed their strong objection to the recently introduced 
policy, and three of these worked during the weekend of the 3rd and 4th 
March. 
Company officials interviewed the staff and then started disciplinary 
procedures. During the process the names of friends who were involved in 
the external attempts finally emerged. It was also discovered that some of 
the unexplained loss and damage of company files could be traced back to 
the activities that took place over the weekend of the 3rd and 4th March. 
The relevant authorities were called in to help in the case and to make 
charges where appropriate. This group of collaborators, staff and friends 
were responsible for gaining unauthorised access, destroying files and 
planting viruses in the company’s system. The enquiry concluded with in­
ternal staff and external individuals being charged by the police for criminal 
activities.
7.5.3  Processes
The general process of information security incident management is illus­
trated in Figure 7.1. 

122 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
7.5.3.1  Planning
Being prepared is vital to being effective in the event of a major incident. 
This is a fairly common sense thing to say, but taking the right action toward 
being prepared is not often done in practice. In many cases, producing a set 
of procedures for incident handling and having the procedures tested and 
tuned to the organisation’s needs more often than not takes place only after 
a few major incidents have happened. Some organisations partially address 
the problem (e.g., they may have an incident system in place but nothing 
else to protect against malware or software vulnerabilities and not a com­
prehensive system that can deal with any form of incident).
So it is important to have in place a set of policies and procedures de­
fining a typical set of incidents; the process for identifying and evaluating 
these; an agreed response, resolution and recovery process; a “what next” 
process; a determination of who is responsible for what part of the process; 
and the means of communications during an incident while it is occurring. 
It is important that this is not just a paper exercise, but that these processes 
are tested in advance of any potential incident occurring. 
The planning activity should establish an incident response team with 
defined roles and responsibilities. This planning activity should also define 
whom to engage with regarding incident events: internal groups (senior 
management, security team, IT support, legal team, media relations, hu­
man resources and so on) and external groups (affected external parties, 
software vendors, CERTs, ISPs and so on).
7.5.3.2  Identification, Detection and Report
The process needs to identify, detect, report and record: 

 What the incident is (is it minor or major)? 

 Where in the system is it occurring (internally, externally or both)? 

 What resources are being affected (internal and/or external)? 
Figure 7.1  Incident management process.

7.5  Incident Management 
123
There may be a precursor, a sign, that an incident may occur in the 
future, or an indication that an incident may have occurred or may be oc­
curring now. Accurate reporting and recording of this information on an 
incident reporting template is essential to the analysis and responding phase 
of the process.
7.5.3.3  Analysis and Evaluation
The information that is reported needs to analysed and evaluated by the 
team to assess the extent and scale of the incident, the severity of the inci­
dent, and to ask questions such as:

 Is what is being reported an actual information security incident or 
some other type of event? 

 Is the information accurate? Does the information reported provide 
a complete picture of the situation? Some indicators may provide 
information that is incorrect or inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, 
ambiguous and introduce false positives or false negatives.

 What is the nature of the incident? What are its characteristics? Are 
the symptoms clear, obvious, and easy to understand? 

 What is the scope of the incident? The scope should indicate which 
parts of the business are affected; what information systems and busi­
ness processes are affected; what networks, IT systems, applications, 
services are affected; and the who, what and how (i.e., source and 
cause of the incident and how it is occurring).

 Is it contained in one area or is it spreading?

 If it is spreading, how fast is it spreading? 

 Is it isolated to just internal systems, has it come in from the outside or 
is it spreading to outside? 
These and many other questions need to be asked to be able to start the 
response and recovery process knowing what should be down, where and 
to what. Also both internal and external stakeholders need to be notified.
The incident response team needs to analyse, check and validate each 
incident. On deciding whether the event is actually an incident, the team 
should do an initial analysis to determine the scope of the incident and 
sufficient information to prioritise what actions need to be taken and what 
response strategy to take (e.g., containment, eradication).

124 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
7.5.3.4  Response 
In responding to the incident, the team needs to work in a timely way and 
to recover the system to its original operational state as soon as possible. 
Time is of the essence to stop the problem spreading and to ensure the or­
ganisation can keep functioning properly in order not to damage or lose its 
business through excessive delays caused by the response process. 
Some key points:

 Prioritisation of what to deal with first to respond to the incident is of 
crucial importance; expedient management decision making is critical 
to the success of the response, resolution and recovery. The incidents 
to be dealt with as high priority will depend on the business impact 
and recoverability requirements; operational impact; information 
security impact; corporate, financial and legal impact; and recoverabil­
ity—but, of course, people’s safety and security should get the highest 
priority, above all else.

 The nature, severity and spreading of the incident and the resources 
affected determines the time and effort needed to get the business 
operations, processes, systems and networks back to normal. The time 
and resources to recover may be extensive.

 Get the information security handling team started on dealing with 
recovery.

 Process the evaluated results and evidence about incident.

 Take action to contain the incident.
7.5.3.5  Timeliness of Response
An incident can be thought of as the coming together of a threat and vul­
nerability. When a hacker is able to exploit the weaknesses in an organisa­
tion’s access system software or an access method, the result is an incident 
of unauthorized access. The impact can vary depending on what the hacker 
is able to do and how fast the organisation is at stopping the hacker. In the 
case of malware, this depends on how fast the organisation is able to stop 
the spread of the malware infecting IT systems. Therefore, time is of the 
absolute essence in dealing with incidents, especially that are severe and 
involve critical business systems or processes. 
The hacker may start by getting access to files and downloading them, 
then installing malicious code in the system, and finally using the organisa­
tion’s network vulnerabilities to connect to the network of one of its major 

7.5  Incident Management 
125
customers. This whole chain of events, if allowed to happen, could result 
in various financial and legal impacts as well as loss of its image and repu­
tation. If this chain of events is contained early enough in its cycle, then 
the damage and impact to the organisation can be limited. So timeliness of 
response is very important.
Of course, if the incident puts people’s lives at risk, their safety and se­
curity is the highest priority, but again a timely response is of the essence. 
Such might be the case with an environmental incident, an explosion, a 
bombing or a natural disaster. The people safety aspect takes highest prior­
ity over everything else. 
7.5.3.6  Recovery
Recovering from the incident involves getting the system that was affected 
back to its normal operational state so that business can continue to oper­
ate. Again, time is of the essence to avoid any unnecessary losses to the 
organisation during the time when the incident was active and the organi­
sation was not fully operational. Some key points:

 Contain, eradicate and resolve the problem.

 Restore.

 Reestablish any affected computer systems and other IT equipment, 
computer networking capability and connections. Recovery may in­
volve:

 Restoring from backups any lost, damaged or corrupted data that 
occurred during the incident;

 Rebuilding systems;

 Replacing files that have been compromised;

 Installing patches;

 Changing passwords and accounts and improving system and 
network security;

 Reconfiguring systems and networking;

 Reestablish and restore business systems, processes and services back 
to a normal operational state—check that everything is functioning 
correctly and as expected; communicate this to staff and management, 
customers, suppliers and other appropriate stakeholders. 

 Fully document the incident case and changes that need to be made 
to the system, policies, procedures and processes; undertake any final 
actions to close the incident case file.

126 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
7.5.3.7  Post Incident Review and Follow Up
This part of the process is important—first, to do a review of the incident 
situation, and, second, to take preventative actions to make the necessary 
improvements to protect the organisation from further incidents of this type 
from reoccurring. 
Post incident review:

 Review the incident report forms;

 Carry out a forensic analysis of the incident;

 Review the effectiveness of the incident handling process and the in­
formation security incident handling controls; 

 Undertake a business impact analysis of the incident.
Improvements and updates:

 Make recommendations for improvements to the ISMS;

 Take steps to improve the incident management process and controls;

 Update policies, procedures, processes and training where appropriate;

 Where necessary make changes to contracts and SLAs;

 Finally produce an incident report.
7.5.3.8  Incident Investigations
Incident investigations involve the use of digital investigation techniques 
to identify, gather, evaluate and preserve information (digital evidence—
information stored or transmitted in digitak form that may be relied on as 
evidence) related to an incident that has occurred. Such information might 
be used as evidence, for example, in the case of civil or criminal actions or 
for internal management purposes (e.g., internal policy breaches and viola­
tions, resolving operational problems and system recovery).
Examining and investigating (as mentioned in ISO/IEC 27001 Annex 
A.16.1.7) a “collection of evidence” is covered in more detail in the stan­
dards referred to in Section 8.6.7.
7.5.3.9  Incident—Cause and Effects
The situation an organisation faces is taking action today based on what 
happened in the past and its current experiences of the present—yesterday’s 

7.5  Incident Management 
127
causes become the results of today (the effects), and tomorrow’s results are 
caused by today’s events. The causes and effects are both events—the cause 
of the security compromise yesterday has an effect on the organisation to­
day; the effect of not resolving this problem today causes continuing or a set 
of new problems tomorrow and so on. We should learn from the mistakes 
of the past that cause our security problems to help us do the right things 
today and to protect our future—see Figure 7.2.
7.5.4  Incident Management Team
An information security incident management process involves those ac­
tivities to identify, analyse and correct problems and facilitate the response 
and recovery of the systems that have suffered from the incident. This pro­
cess should involve a multidisciplinary team, with a range of skills needed 
to deal with a range of issues. Typically, the incident might require the in­
volvement of management, information security staff, IT and non-IT staff, 
physical security staff, human resources, legal advisors, those handling ex­
ternal relations and the press, and sometime external parties emergency 
services, policy and maybe even trade unions. 
The team needs to be able to analyse the situation, determine the scale 
and severity of the compromise, initiate appropriate action to correct the 
Figure 7.2  Incident—the cause and effect.

128 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
problem and prevent it from reoccurring and liaise and communicate all the 
relevant internal and external parties. The incident handling team should 
have a leader whose task it is to coordinate the process and facilitate and 
manage the team that is deployed in the process.

7.6  ISMS Availability and Business Continuity
7.6.1  Value and Importance
There should be little doubt as to the importance and value of ISMS avail­
ability, information security incident management and business continuity 
play in supporting the organisation. 
We have many global examples of business systems, processes and ser­
vices failing and being inoperable for hours, crippling businesses whose op­
erations come to a halt. The causes of these incidents can range from natu­
ral disasters to online attacks with the deliberate intent of bringing systems 
down. Today’s business reliance on the Internet and IT should place more 
of an emphasis on businesses being ready to respond to such incidents and 
to recover as soon as possible to ensure an acceptable level of continuity of 
business operations. The business impact of not having appropriate resil­
ience, response, contingency and protection processes in place can all too 
well be seen by the various real cases that have hit the headlines, from man-
made situations to natural hazards or a combination of both (i.e., where a 
natural hazard triggers a disaster relating to some man-made situation). 
Headline news raises awareness of how vulnerable our systems can be and 
the impact on business when things go wrong. This heightened awareness 
draws the attention and concerns of organisations, citizens and consum­
ers alike. It triggers some organisations to rethink how would they cope if 
it happened to them. They need to question and examine how good their 
processes and systems would be at coping with these issues. 
Many companies have not sufficiently protected themselves with an 
effective business continuity process, and some do not even have such a 
process in place. Sometimes the reason that business continuity is not in 
place is that organisations believe it presents too many challenges and/or 
is too expensive or they just don’t know what to do. These are some of the 
reasons why small-sized companies do not go for business continuity, as the 
cost, know how and resources are out of their reach. This, of course, should 
not be the case, since there are many routes available for getting simple 
advice on what can be done, and the implementation of some of the basics 
should not be out of the reach of small-sized companies. At the end of the 
day, the company needs to weigh the costs of the resulting impact of not 
doing anything against the cost of doing something with the reduction in 
the business impact. It could make the difference between survival of the 

130 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
business and closure of the business. It should be clear that there is business 
value in doing it, no matter how perfect the solution is. It is important to 
take that first step of doing something, to build upon the basics, and the rest 
will fall in place with the right guidance. One of the important things to do 
first is to get management commitment, and this can be achieved by doing 
an initial business impact analysis.  
7.6.2  Business Impact
One of the important questions to ask is, “What are the critical things that 
are essential to the organisation to enable it to continue to operate?” Once 
we know this, we can then test these out by looking at some examples that 
might appropriate to the organisation running its business. These can then 
be used to calculate the business impacts the organisation might be chal­
lenged with in the event of disastrous incidents occurring. 
If the organisation is not prepared and has no continuity plans in place 
for the advent of a disaster, disruption to its operations, a major systems fail­
ures or external influences from the markets it’s involved in, then it leaves 
the organisation wide open to being exposed to high impacts that could 
ruin the business. For example:

 Supply chain failures and disruptions;

 Denial of service attack shutting down or grossly restricting operations 
dependent on ICT systems, services and a networking capability; 

 Critical loss of supporting infrastructure (e.g., electricity, gas or water 
supplies) and services (e.g., telecommunication services, ISP services, 
outsourcing facilities);

 Major economic failures and losses, including critical depression in 
market conditions (e.g., share prices, interest rates, world/country 
economies);

 Strikes, political activities or breakdowns in workforce relations;

 Environmental hazards and disasters;


7.6  ISMS Availability and Business Continuity 
131
7.6.3  Plans 
It is essential that the organisation should have in place a business continu­
ity plan. This plan should include documented procedures that will give 
clear instructions of what to do to respond, recover, resume and restore to 
an acceptable level of operations following a disruption, disaster, emergency 
or failure. This plan should include information on the required resources, 
services and activities to be undertaken to ensure the continued use of criti­
cal business functions, processes and systems. 
The scope of the business continuity plan is likely to cover a broad 
range of topics and activities, especially providing availability, continuity 
and recovery of critical business elements: business functions, processes and 
services. The scope of the plan should cover aspects of disaster recovery, 
incident management, information security management, safety manage­
ment and emergency and crisis management. ISO 22301 provides more 
details regarding continuity plans and ISO/IEC 27002 Chapter 17 covers the 
information security aspects of business continuity management. 
7.6.4  Processes 
Business continuity planning and supporting processes are aimed at ensur­
ing that the right resources are available and the right activities are being 
undertaken to keep continuity of the critical elements of the business run­
ning and operating, and if these critical elements become unavailable and 
inoperable during a disaster that processes are in place to recover these as a 
matter of urgency. 
In today’s business environment, where ICT is a vital tool to the proper 
functioning of the business, it is important to protect the ICT accordingly in 
the event of a disaster. When the ICT has failed, been compromised, become 
damaged or become unavailable during a disaster, then timely recovery of 
the ICT is vital, which might mean replacing damaged ICT. 
An essential process included in business continuity management is 
undertaking an impact analysis. This involves gathering, analysing and 
evaluating this information to assess the impact with regard to loss of con­
fidentiality, integrity and availability. The results of this can then go toward 
a review and decision-making process to determine the organisation’s re­
quirements and what should be done to guard against such business im­
pacts occurring.

7.7.1  SME Design Services
7.7.1.1  Introduction
A small company with 11 full time staff members provides household de­
signs for domestic users. This includes customised fitted kitchens and bath­
rooms, studies, living rooms and dining rooms. The company consists of 
consultants and designers, salespeople, showroom staff, the owner and a 
secretary. 
The company has been in operation for seven years and is well recog­
nised as a supplier of quality designs. The company has just one showroom/

7.7  ISMS Use Examples 
133
office located on the ground floor of a five-floor building on a busy high 
street of a town in the UK. The company has already been operating an 
ISMS for the past three years. They now want to expand the business to 
network its PCs, give remote access via consultants’ laptops when on cus­
tomers sites, add web site services to its customers and open two other of­
fices in other European countries to provide the same sort of services.
The company has carried out a SWOT analysis to assess the feasibility of 
the objectives and potential success of expansion. Based on this analysis, it 
decides to go ahead. Their business implementation plan includes an exten­
sion of the scope of its ISMS to include its website presence, remote access 
and its two new planned offices.
7.7.1.2  Existing and Future ISMS Deployment
The company went through a gap analysis to identify that their existing 
information security system includes:

 An information security policy;

 Procedures on backups, viruses, and handling personal and customer 
information;

 Password control on all office PCs and consultant laptops;

 Physical access controls to its offices, rooms and filing cabinets.
A target ISMS scope is defined to cover all existing operational needs 
as well as future plans for expansion. A risk assessment on the new ISMS 
scope is done, taking into account the increase in its resources and the ex­
pansion of its business processes, the results of which are evaluated and 
developed into a risk treatment and ISMS implementation plan. As their 
future business plan rolls out over the coming six months, so does the im­
plementation of their ISMS, and within a further six months they are fully 
operational. Their Internet side of the business starts to grow, as does the 
number of staff employed by the company, as they are getting more cus­
tomer enquiries and orders.
7.7.2  Legal Services
7.7.2.1  Introduction
A small legal firm with 17 full-time staff members provides legal advice for 
both commercial businesses as well as citizens. The firm has three offices in 
different cities in the UK. It has been established for more than 25 years and 
has many high-profile corporate clients on its books. Over the past three 

134 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
years, it has relied more and more on the use of IT services and the Internet 
to conduct its business. It is now becoming quite clear that it needs to do 
something about enhancing its existing information security to take into 
account its high-tech way of doing business.
7.7.2.2  Existing and Future ISMS Deployment
The firm already has security measures in place for its business, but these 
are stand-alone solutions with very little networking deployed. The security 
it has in place needs to be enhanced to meet the needs of management for 
a more integrated, networked environment. The decision to use ISO/IEC 
27001 was made after the firm was made aware of other firms in the legal 
services business going down the same route. Its main IT resources and In­
ternet capability consists of:

 A number of office PCs networked together to a central server;

 Internet access via a firewall connected to the office server;

 Laptops, tablets and mobiles (all Wi-Fi enabled) used by legal profes­
sionals. 
The information it processes includes:

 Confidential client case files, reports, letters, statements and other 
documents;

 The firm’s internal confidential and restricted information, documents 
and files;

 Library of legal books, works of reference and other generally publicly 
available information.
The task they embarked on (with the help of external consultants) was 
first to identify the needs and expectations of management, clients and 
other interested parties relevant to an ISMS, then to define an appropriate 
ISMS scope commensurate with the nature of their business, before carry­
ing out a risk assessment and risk treatment exercise. The risk assessment 
and risk treatment exercise concluded with the need to implement a range 
of new controls to enhance their existing protection and to facilitate protec­
tion of their newly networked business environment. This led the firm to 
implement an ISMS to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 and for an audit 
to be carried out by an accredited certification body, which resulted in the 
award of a ISO/IEC 27001 certificate.

7.7.3  Electronic Accounting System
7.7.3.1  Introduction
The management of a large retail company decides to install a fully in­
tegrated electronic accounting system, but before doing so the decision is 
made to check the requirements for achieving an effective level of infor­
mation security. The current accounting system does use PCs, but these 
are not networked together to provide a streamlined start-to- finish pro­
cess for handling sales, purchases, orders, invoices, payments, delivery and 
dispatch notes. Their future plans require the installation of an IT system 
networked throughout the company with links to external customers and 
suppliers, with appropriate software application packages. This will enable 
staff to process and share information online within the company and also 
to electronically process orders, payments and other documents to suppliers 
and customers.
7.7.3.2  Existing and Future ISMS Deployment
Although the company has protection measures in place, it decides to carry 
out a complete overhaul of its information security taking account of ex­
isting controls. They recruit someone as their security officer and together 
with departments such as sales, purchasing, finance, operations and IT ser­
vices they develop an ISMS scope and design based on ISO/IEC 27001. 
They get management approval and commitment to implement this 
ISMS design across all of its five locations. Although the project is quite a 
sizable undertaking the management team wants to achieve this electronic 
accounting system development as soon as possible to take advantage of the 
business benefits of such a system and provide added value to their custom­
ers, they decide to supplement their internal project team with external 
consultants. 
In addition the gap analysis and risk assessment was not easy to accom­
plish due to multisite nature of the project; the current lack of coordination, 
consistency and integration of the current system; and some local resistance 
from staff regarding issues to do with change and questions on security. 
It is then agreed that senior management must get more closely involved 
to show their full support and to commit to more resources. After several 
months delay in making progress, the company rolls out a fully operational 
electronic accounting system with information security in place. Due this 
experience, management is persuaded to recruit a second full-time employ­
ee to support the security officer to maintain the ISMS. Over the next six 
to nine months, the company prepares itself for third-party certification, 
which it achieved.

7.7.4  Government Payment System
7.7.4.1  Introduction
An e-government department in Southeast Asia operates both an offline 
and online payment system refunding citizens for their social security 
claims. As with many governments around the world, the attraction of con­
verting their business processes to utilize e-commerce technology and pro­
viding the public with online access to public information and government 
services (e.g., to pay taxes, claim benefits, apply for visa applications and so 
on) is strong. Such use of e-commerce can be used for internal government 
business, by government for external organisation business and transac­
tions, or by government for citizen transactions and sharing of information. 
In this scenario, another government department whose responsibility it is 
to advise on information security matters recommends that all e-commerce 
applications go down the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS route. 
7.7.4.2  Existing and Future ISMS Deployment
This particular government department, dealing with social service pay­
ments, always had information security measures due to the sensitive na­
ture of the claims they were handling, especially as they involved general 
personal data as well as more specific details such as health-related infor­
mation. Their future plans had covered moving over to a more electronic 
way of submitting claims with “social services Internet café”–type facilities 
in government centres and offices around the country all networked to 
the department dealing with social services. The ISMS for this social ser­
vices Internet café had to deal with citizen privacy technology, citizen smart 
cards for identification and authentication purposes as well as accessing the 
system, secure exchange of citizen information and secure information pro­
cessing facilities in the government department. Of course, around this is 
the management framework for making this function effectively.
The scale of this project is large and complex, and so it is decided to roll 
this out in phases, focusing on one particular town of a medium-sized pop­
ulation to trial out the ISMS design, to improve the design where necessary 
and then to proceed with other towns to gradually cover the whole country. 
This first trial was successful, although ISMS did need various adjustments 
and improvements regarding its implementation controls. After subsequent 
phases of work had been completed, growing the ISMS solution to more 
than 70% coverage of the population, the government decided to go for a 
third-party certification audit.

7.7.5  Outsourcing Call Centre Operations
7.7.5.1  Introduction
In the interests of streamlining the business and cost cutting, a major in­
ternational European-based company outsources its call centre operations 
to a company in Asia. This type of business has become very common and 
popular over the years, and one that is expected to grow. Their outsourced 
call centre operations cover the company’s customers all over Europe, and 
the daily number of customer enquiries continues to grow due to their busi­
ness successes. 
7.7.5.2  Existing and Future ISMS Deployment
It is of utmost importance that an information security risk assessment is 
carried out before undertaking such an operational change, especially to 
consider the various factors involved in outsourcing to overseas countries, 
including the following.
Geographical, Environmental and Political Factors

 What hazards apply to this particular area of the world? Is it in an 
earthquake zone or an area prone to volcanic activity, tornadoes, ty­
phoons, tsunamis and other natural phenomena? Many areas in Asia 
have these types of problems.

 Is the location in an area of political and social stability? Is it economi­
cal stable?
IT Facilities, Communications and Levels of Service

 Are the communication systems able to cope with the volume of cus­
tomer traffic?

 Can the outsourced company supply adequate facilities and resources 
to fulfill the contract requirements (e.g., sufficient capacity to meet 
demands and effective information security, backup, disaster recovery 
and business continuity arrangements, response times, performance 
and service levels)?

 Can the location and IT facilities be easily secured from a physical per­
spective from local threats? 

138 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
Information Security

 Has the outsourced company carried out a risk assessment and risk 
treatment exercise? Has the outsourced company implemented ad­
equate information security to protect the information of its custom­
ers? Does it provide appropriate information separation of each of its 
customers? Does it take regular audits and reviews of its information 
security? Does it have an incident management process in place? Does 
it have a business continuity management system?
Staffing Levels

 Can the outsourced company supply an adequate number of trained 
staff to fulfill the contract requirements (e.g., communication skills, 
knowledge, experience and language skills)?
In the case of this particular outsourcing organisation and its informa­
tion risks, it has developed an ISMS, it is being used to provide protection of 
its call centre operation and it has been certified to ISO/IEC 27001 to dem­
onstration to its customers that they are fit for purpose. Sometimes, it is the 
customer itself that requires the outsourced company to be certified to ISO/
IEC 27001. It should be noted that sometimes, it is the customer itself that 
requires the outsourced company to be certified to be in conformance with 
the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001.
7.7.6  Manufacturing Systems
7.7.6.1  Introduction
A successful medium-sized manufacturing business is certified to ISO 9001, 
or quality management system (QMS). It has now decided that it should 
consider applying ISO/IEC 27001 across its business to complement its ISO 
9001 capability. It would eventually like to integrate the two systems to­
gether to create an efficient and effective management framework to gain 
the cost benefits of having an integrated certification audit.
7.7.6.2  Existing and Future ISMS Deployment
Its current information security practice seemed to have been sufficient in 
past years, but there is growing awareness of the threats and risks the com­
pany faces from observing market trends in its particular industry sector. An 
additional drive toward gaining more awareness is the fact that one of its 

7.7  ISMS Use Examples 
139
competitors suffered a damaging attack on one of the competitor’s IT-based 
automated production lines. The company employed a consultant to do a 
gap analysis and risk assessment of its current systems. The results of this 
were quite startling for the company, as it turned out its current informa­
tion security provisions were only 35% conformant with ISO/IEC 27001, 
and in fact 20% of these had been picked up by the recent ISO 9001 surveil­
lance audit as things that had an impact on its QMS implementation. Even 
more startling was the large areas of noncompliance, 55% of which turned 
out to be high-risk areas based on the results of the consultant’s risk report. 
Their main areas of risk were:

 General lack of management policy and procedures; 

 No operational procedures in a number of key areas, such as for infor­
mation handling, backups and access control;

 No regular risk assessment programme;

 No regular monitoring, audit or reviews of its information security;

 Insufficient access control for operating systems, internal networked 
services and applications;

 No information security incident management processes;

 The gateway to the Internet was wide open to external threats, allow­
ing relatively easy access to the internal network;

 Lack of information security awareness and training; 

 Insufficient resources to carry out information security–related tasks;

 Lack of information security considerations in its contracts and SLAs 
with third-party service providers;

 No vulnerability management;

 Lack of protection against social engineering attacks;

 Lack of information security for business continuity.
After several management decision-making meetings, the company de­
cided to go ahead with developing an ISMS for the whole company. The 
work was contracted to a small company specializing in this work, which 
had a track record in different parts of the world in helping clients to es­
tablish ISMS solutions in conformance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 
27001. After an intensive contracting period, the company implemented 
an ISMS. The company even went a stage further to get certified to ISO/

140 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
IEC 27001, out timing their competitor. Its next challenge was to work with 
the certification body toward planning an integrated ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 
27001 audit.
7.7.7  Supply Chain Management 
7.7.7.1  Introduction
Supply chains are the norm for most organisations. For the organisation to 
work efficiently, it needs to manage its operational and business relation­
ship with its supply chain effectively, especially if the business is in a fast-
moving and dynamic market where market competition, customer satisfac­
tion, timeliness and profitability are vital. The supply chain can be viewed 
as a networked system of organisations, human resources, operations and 
communications and information and IT resources all working together to 
deliver a product or service to the end customer. The supply chain industry 
thrives on the flow of accurate information being available 24x7 (i.e., 24 
hours a day, seven days a week). 
Typical examples are online purchases of books, food supply chains, car 
parts, components and subassemblies to support car manufacturers, energy 
supplies, supply chains supporting the construction industry, supply chains 
supporting the travel industry or supply chains supporting the production 
and supply of medicines for the health care industry. All of these supply 
chains need to run both efficiently and effectively to fulfill customer and 
consumer needs and demands.
Supply chains link together an organisation’s value chain of activities, 
such as the logistics of both its inbound and outbound services, its opera­
tions in producing things or delivering services, its marketing and sales sup­
port and its maintenance support.
Outsourcing companies (sometimes referred to as third-party logistics 
providers, or 3PL) are available to support an organisation’s supply chain, 
such as in the provisioning of integrated warehousing and transportation 
services.
7.7.7.2  Existing and Future ISMS Deployment
Again, supply chain management is another application where ISO/IEC 
27001 is able to provide a management framework to manage its informa­
tion security risks. Some organisations that supply logistic support services 
have been certified against ISO/IEC 27001 for this very purpose, especially 
those that also provide international logistic support.

8.1.1  How Effective, Adequate and Suit­
able Is the ISMS?
Is my ISMS fit for purpose? What exactly does 
this mean? Here, we are taking it to mean that 
the performance of the ISMS is effective, ad­
equate and suitable to meet with the organi­
sation’s policy, strategy, objectives and business 
and legal requirements. This leads to the ques­
tion of how do I evaluate the ISMS to check its 
performance, and the answer is by monitoring 
aspects of the ISMS, taking ISMS measurements 
and reviews. So are the ISMS processes success­
fully providing protection of the organisation’s 
information resources? Are the policies and 
procedures suitable? Are the ISMS resources 
adequate to manage the risks? These and many 
other questions arise when we start to evalu­
ate the performance of the ISMS to check that 
it delivers the desired and intended result (i.e., 
the ISMS addresses all the requirements and is­
sues discussed in Chapter 3; it is managing the 

142 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
risks as discussed in Chapter 4; it has implemented ISMS with suitable and 
adequate policies; processes, procedures and other controls to manage the 
risk as discussed Chapters 6 and 7; it is monitoring and reviewing the ISMS) 
as well as the requirements in Chapters 5 and 7 on leadership and mange­
ment support and it engaged in continued improvement (Chapter 10).
Performance levels of the ISMS will vary as time goes by because of 
change: business changes, market changes, political and economic changes, 
resources changes, environmental changes, legal changes, technological 
changes. These are a few of the types of changes that the organisation may 
face, and all of these carry with it the chance that the levels of risk and im­
pact will change.
8.1.2  Change and the Certainty of Change
“Nothing is as constant as change” is an old adage, which is very apt. It is 
often said that change is the quality of impermanence, and everything on 
this earth is impermanent, in a state of constant flux. The Greek philoso­
pher Heraclitus saw change as ever present, ever flowing and all encom­
passing. Change is at the core of continuous improvement and making sure 
the organisation is managing its risk to ensure it’s protecting its information 
at all times. Monitoring and reviewing changes, the causes and effects en­
able the organisation manage the resulting changes in risks and impacts 
appropriately. 
Changes may happen slowly or rapidly, decrease or increase, go for­
ward or reverse or progress in the same or different direction; everything 
at one point in time will change, whether it is something that is physically 
strong or weak, tangible or intangible. Change can be sequential, nonse­
quential or consequential. Organisations need to view change as a natural 
process, and they should monitor and review the patterns of change, the 
speed and direction—its velocity—and any other aspects that will affect and 
impact the organisation. 
As Sun Tzu’s words reflect that the organisation knowing itself and its 
business, and knowing the environment and markets they are doing busi­
ness in, can lead to a better chance of achieving 100% success. Of course, 
continuation of this success requires the organisation knowing, under­
standing and adapting in a suitable way to both the internal and external 
changes. The organisation knowing its information security strengths and 
weaknesses (vulnerabilities) and also the threats that might exploit these 
gives it a better chance of managing its information security risks. Regu­
lar monitoring and reviewing any changes to these strengths, weaknesses 
and threats enables it to be in a better position to continue to improve and 
maintain an effective information security capability. 

8.1  Performance, Change and Improvement 
143
An organisation knowing its online business capability and its infor­
mation security strengths and weaknesses, and its competitors’ capabilities, 
strengths and weaknesses in this field, enables the organisation to manage 
and improve its information security risk controls capabilities. Again, regu­
lar monitoring and reviewing of any changes to these conditions to contin­
ue is necessary to improve and maintain an effective information security 
capability and enable business opportunities.
How much change has occurred? What are the effects of the change? 
What is the level of change in risk and impact? These and other related 
questions all become the subject of measurements as part of the overall 
performance evaluation exercise.
8.1.3  Change Management
8.1.3.1  Change Happens
There are two basic forms of change: change that is planned by the organi­
sation (an organisation plans to adopt a new technology) and change that 
is unintended or unplanned by the organisation and not under its control 
(changes in the market, legislation that the organisation needs to respond 
and adapt to). In both cases, information security is a critical element in 
adapting and/or responding to the change. 
Change management is about the path of transition from the current 
state of the business operations to the future state of business operations. 
The process of transition can go relatively smoothly, or it might be fraught 
with difficulties. As such, change management involves members of staff, 
business and operational teams, management and the organisation itself. 
How an organisation adapts to the change process can make a big difference 
to its business. If there is resistance to the changes, then this can hamper the 
overall success of the transition and the end result. Individuals in general 
may be anxious about change and might have an innate sense to resist. In 
the case of major business change (e.g., downsizing, a merger, more auto­
mated business processes), the organisation needs to help its staff to prepare 
and make the transition as smooth as possible whilst helping to allay any 
anxieties. 
There will always be individuals or certain business groups, rather than 
the whole organisation itself, who resist change: this situation is normal. 
Taking the path of least resistance is a good strategy for many difficult situ­
ations in all walks of life. Using an area of the business it knows to be open 
and receptive, and that offers the least resistance to a proposed change, is 
a good starting point to introduce and test out the change. Once this area 
of the business gains confidence through deployment of the change and 
other parts of organisation see its success and value to the business, the 

144 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
organisation can then start to roll out the change across the rest of the 
organisation. 
It has been said that the key to success is to keep change to a minimum 
and not go for change for the sake of change. Some things may not, or 
should not, need to be changed, in order to ensure consistency and business 
continuity. Adoption of changes should be in flow with the business and go­
ing for a “big bang” approach is not necessarily the best move; it is better to 
change strategy via a path of least resistance. Of course, it is entirely up to 
the organisation, it is its commercial choice how much change is necessary 
to meet its future mission and business objectives. Whatever set of changes 
are proposed by the organisation, an information security risk and impact 
assessment needs to be carried out before any changes are implemented. 
For example, a complete overhaul and upgrading of the organisation’s IT 
strategy for both IT acquisition and deployment needs a good knowledge 
of the internal and external factors that might have an impact on this strat­
egy. In addition, the information security controls required in relation to 
the use of this new/upgraded IT needs careful consideration (e.g., knowing 
what external changes have driven this new strategy, what the changes will 
mean to its staff as well as to its customers and suppliers or what impact 
these changes will have on its market positioning).
8.1.3.2  Process
Change management processes must consider:

 How the changes fit into the bigger business environment the or­
ganisation operates within, making sure the implementation of the 
changes work for the organisation;

 There are no conflicts with the ISMS implementation, and all the nec­
essary risks and impacts have been taken into account;

 There is adequate awareness and training of staff with regard to the 
changes, including any training related to information security;

 Communication of changes to all interested parties;

 Gaining the support and cooperation of staff for the adoption of the 
changes.
8.1.3.3  Types of Changes
There are several types of changes, including those driven by external forces 
to which the organisation needs to decide how to respond and react, and 

8.1  Performance, Change and Improvement 
145
those planned and instigated by the organisation (e.g., where it can be more 
proactive in driving and leading the market with new customers, services 
and/or products). In both cases, business risks need to be considered (e.g., 
the risks of adoption by the organisation of a new technology to give it more 
advantage in the market or taking risks to drive the market with its own 
development of new technologies). Other examples include the following:

 Changes in business policy, strategy and objectives;

 Mergers, business downsizing and business expansion;

 Changes in business processes and operational practices;

 Changes regarding the nature, use and application of information and 
information systems;

 External changes—political and economic, markets, customer base, 
environmental and social;

 High turnover of human resources;

 Changes to legislation and regulations that the organisation needs to 
consider to avoid the risk of legal noncompliance;

 New, or changes to existing, contractual obligations, SLAs or contracts 
that the organisation needs to consider to react to avoid the risk of 
legal noncompliance or breach of contract;

 Changes to the supply chain driving the organisation or by being 
driven by the organisation;

 Changes to the technological risks;

 Changes in the overall risk profile due to internal or external events 
and activities.
Again, in all these examples of change there could be information secu­
rity requirements, risks and impacts that need to be considered.
8.1.4  Tracking and Reviewing Ongoing Change
The overall ISMS monitoring process is about getting information about 
all types of change and whether there is the rise in risk and impact levels. 
Monitoring the result of change may appear through tracking incidents and 
looking for trends and patterns—whether there has been an improvement 
or deterioration in the information security performance. 

146 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
Several processes can be used to provide information about changes 
and the effects of change. An obvious one is the incident handling process, 
which provides information about changes to risks and impacts, along with 
the organisation’s ability to respond to these. Reassessing the risks and im­
pacts and doing gap analysis also provides similar information.
Scorecards, staff feedback and similar types of human methods can and 
do provide some valuable information. Technology in the form of firewalls, 
IDS devices, audit trail applications, various monitoring tool for networks, 
services, web browsing and web-based applications can also add consider­
able value in this information-gathering process, all the time building up a 
better picture of the changes, the trends and patterns allowing future plan­
ning and well-informed management-decision making. Also, the organi­
sation should not ignore the valuable information that could be available 
from customer and supplier feedback.
8.1.5  Informed Decision Making
Informed decision making in the organisation is essential if the ISMS is to 
be effective, adequate and suitable to meet business needs. The organisation 
needs to have a core knowledge of its strengths, weakness, opportunities 
and threats regarding its ISMS in the context of its business. This includes 
having a clear knowledge and understanding of its business and legal re­
quirements in relation to its ISMS; the performance requirements in terms 
of the effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of the ISMS; and the nature 
and degree of the risks and impacts it faces, its risk criteria and how much 
risk it is prepared to tolerate and accept. Having a core knowledge and un­
derstanding of its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats will en­
hance informed policy and decision making, and this greatly assists with its 
ability to manage it ISMS business support and resources. 
As mentioned earlier, information security is more of a management, 
people, process, policy and procedural issue, and implemented and treated 
this way it is a business enabler to support its business investments and 
opportunities. 
The management of an organisation is responsible for the manage­
ment of the risks its faces. This includes operational responsibility as well 
as providing assurance that the security processes themselves are suitable, 
adequate and effective, including the risk management process, incident 
handling process, backup process and so on. Risk management in general 
covers the assessment of the risks, the implementation and deployments 
of controls and processes by which the risks are managed and maintained 
at an acceptable level. The system of controls (policy, procedures, process­
es and so on) deployed by the organisation should depend strictly on the 

8.2  Monitoring and Operational Reviews 
147
considered risks and impacts. In order that the right security processes, pol­
icies, procedures and other controls are suitable, adequate and effective, 
then informed decision making is essential and critical to the management 
review process (Section 8.7). 
8.2  Monitoring and Operational Reviews
8.2.1  Monitoring 
8.2.1.1  Monitoring and Reviewing the ISMS
Monitoring the ISMS is one of the major areas of requirement and activity 
in ISO/IEC 27001, and it falls under the heading of performance evaluation. 
There are several aspects of the ISMS an organisation should be consider­
ing, including monitoring and review of the following:

 ISMS performance in terms of its effectiveness, adequacy and suitabil­
ity;

 Changes, risks and impacts and their effect on the ISMS performance;

 ISMS processes and information security controls to check their effec­
tiveness, adequacy and suitability; this includes processes for incident 
management, risk assessment/treatment, information processing, ac­
cess control and human resource management; 

 Staff awareness, competence and utilisation of the ISMS; 

 Efficiency, efficacy and effectiveness of the IT and network services 
and infrastructure;

 Management of supplier relationships, services, contracts and SLAs;

 Conformance with the organisation’s policies and procedures, contrac­
tual obligations, laws and regulations.
8.2.1.2  Monitoring and Reviewing Performance
The organisation needs to monitor and review the performance of its ISMS 
in terms of its:

 Effectiveness: Is ISMS successful in producing a desired or intended 
result? 

 Adequacy: Does the ISMS deliver an acceptable quality and amount of 
information security?

148 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 Suitability: Is the ISMS right and appropriate for the organisation’s 
needs, purpose and the nature of business?
Monitoring and reviewing the performance of the ISMS helps the or­
ganisation to maintain and improve the ISMS. This also means monitoring 
and reviewing the ISMS in the organisational context (Section 3.1)—en­
suring  that the ISMS is effective, adequate and suitable in dealing with 
both internal and external issues and business context and that the ISMS is 
meeting the needs and expectations (Section 3.2) of interested parties. 
8.2.1.3  Monitoring and Reviewing Business Demands and Requirements 
It should be clear by now that any activity involving the ISMS needs be 
done in cognisance and familiarity with business demands and the ability 
to meet these demands. This should be the true essence and ethos behind 
the organisation’s implementation of its ISMS. Any reviews relating to the 
ISMS needs to always bear this in mind. 
One way of making sure that activities are in sync with such demands 
and the meeting of requirements of interested parties is to make informa­
tion security a topic on the agenda of management meetings at all levels, a 
part of management decision making, a part of the overall business culture 
and way of thinking and an integrated part of other relevant business ac­
tivities and process. This is to ensure that those dealing with the ISMS do 
not lose sight and focus of the business goals and requirements, that senior 
management is fully aware of the ISMS activities and developments and 
that continued support and commitment are assured.
8.2.2  Monitoring and Review of Staff Awareness, Competency and 
Use of the ISMS
8.2.2.1  Competence
Staff competence is generally considered to be the knowledge, skills and 
behaviour that the organisation requires of an individual to properly per­
form a specific job function or role. For instance, a sales and marketing 
management role might require skill in influence and negotiation, whereas 
a network administrator’s role should include technical knowledge and an­
alytical skills. Someone working in the personnel group responsible for all 
the staff records needs to have a working knowledge of the legislation that 
applies to the handling of personnel data, information security to protect 
data, knowledge of handing personnel problems, skill at handling a range of 
different personnel types, and good communication skills. These are a few 
of the necessary competence requirements.

8.2  Monitoring and Operational Reviews 
149
It is often said that a part of human nature and psychology tends to 
make people examine themselves and either under- or over estimate their 
competence: those that are incompetent at tasks sometime overestimate, 
while those very competent people sometimes underestimate themselves. 
Good management should always motivate rather than demotivate their 
staff, as staff are one of the most important assets the organisation has. 
Providing good management leadership and motivation, giving the right 
amount of responsibility and incentives, and enabling good communication 
channels between management and staff is a pathway to success.
Monitoring staff resource levels, their skill sets, their career develop­
ment, the need for training/retraining and so on is a major task that man­
agement needs to undertake (see Chapter 5). 
8.2.2.2  Security Culture
Staff members are significant drivers in their own productivity and the col­
lective productivity and efficiency of the business. Therefore, it important 
to have good human resources practices in place as well as instilling a good 
security culture. Developing a healthy security culture within the organi­
sation should be one of the main aims of the organisation. This topic of 
security culture is so important as a management control for information 
security that it is being addressed by various international institutions and 
organisations, including the OECD in its paper “Guidelines for the Security 
of Information Systems and Networks—Towards a Culture of Security, July 
2002.” 
Good human resource management should be there to deal with in­
ternal staff problems or conflicts (e.g., dealing with disgruntled or dissatis­
fied staff, those operating under poor working conditions or under undue 
pressure or those that are not being stretched to their levels of skill and 
competency). Dealing with these issues as soon as possible can avoid some 
of the insider risks mentioned earlier, whilst supporting staff productivity 
and efficiency. 
Some organisations have had a security culture operating in their or­
ganisation for many years. These organisations have realized the impor­
tance and benefits that such a culture can offer to the overall awareness and 
subsequent information security of their businesses as a whole. It is often 
said that IT is not the problem of information security; rather, it’s the people 
using the IT. This matches up to many of the security surveys, reviews, 
audits, and reports that indicate that people are the cause of many security 
breaches and incidents.

150 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
8.2.2.3  Monitoring Staff
Monitoring and reviewing staff in relation to their responsibilities and 
roles regarding information security is extremely important. However, this 
should be done as part of the normal line management and human resource 
processes that already exist. It should not be done in a “big brother” way, as 
this will make staff feel ill at ease, demotivated or overly restricted, which 
can lead to mistakes or accidents in their work. It might have an impact on 
their efficiency and efficacy, and it could in some cases lead to a disgruntled 
employee launching an insider attack. So, a balance needs to be reached be­
tween a laissez-faire and a draconian style of human resource management. 
Many organisations have adopted an AUP (Section 6.4.2) to control the 
use of organisational resources and facilities (e.g., IT, Internet services and 
email). 
All forms of monitoring and reviewing of staff activities need to be done 
in accordance with local laws and regulations. 
8.2.2.4  Awareness, Training and Career Development
Developing and improving staff knowledge and skills requires an appropri­
ate level of training and awareness. Formal classroom training, on-the-job 
training and online training are some of the ways the organisation can help 
its staff in attaining the right levels of knowledge and skills for the job. As 
people are of such an importance to an organisation to meet its objectives 
and performance levels, it is equally important to look after staff training, 
awareness and career development. Not only does this ensure that the com­
pany has the right, competent people to do the job, but it also motivates 
staff as their career development is being looked after and avoids unneces­
sary loss of skilled staff that do not receive such attention. Section 8.3 covers 
example measurements concerning staff awareness and training.
Monitoring staff members regarding their ongoing competence to per­
form specific job functions enables the organisation to further develop the 
knowledge, skills and abilities of staff to continue to perform such a job 
efficiently and effectively whilst protecting the organisation’s information. 
Of course, the organisation might want to transfer the individual to 
another job function requiring a different set of competencies and monitor­
ing the individual’s ability, knowledge and career development enables the 
organisation to provide that member of staff with retraining. The human 
resource group plays a key role in managing the process of matching com­
petence requirements of the job to the skills and knowledge of existing staff 
or the recruitment of new staff.

8.2  Monitoring and Operational Reviews 
151
8.2.2.5  Some Specific Information Security Roles
The following is an example list of information security roles related to 
ISMS:

 Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), information security 
officer(s), manager(s);

 Information security–related management roles and tasks/job func­
tions regarding information systems, human resources, operations, 
service management, business continuity and so on;

 Information security risk manager(s);

 Information security incident management team;

 Internal ISMS auditor(s);

 Conformance manager(s), PII officer;

 IT- and network-related security roles.
Of course everyone in the organisation will have some part to play in 
information security, from top/senior management through the various 
level of management, as well as the nonmanagerial staff.
8.2.3  Monitoring and Review of Information Security Processes
The ISO/IEC 27001 defines many processes, including those at the manage­
ment, auditing and conformance level, as well as at the human resource 
level and also at the technical level. These processes will need to be moni­
tored and reviewed to check performance, and if the performance seems to 
be below standard, then the process needs to be improved. For example, if 
a backup fails to function properly, does not complete properly, does not 
deliver according to what is expected, reveals that data recovery is difficult 
or unsuccessful, generates errors on a regular basis or many other possible 
problems, then the process needs to be reviewed and improvements to the 
process are necessary. Other examples of monitoring include the staff re­
cruitment process, the user access management process (granting and re­
moval of accounts, allocation of access rights, privileges and passwords, au­
thentication attributes and so on), service management process or various 
activities relating to information processing. 
The risk management process itself should be reviewed from time to 
time. The effectiveness of the ISMS is dependent on quality of the risk 
management: monitoring and reviewing the risk assessment results, the 
assessment criteria and methods used, the method for determining which 

152 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
controls are to be implemented, the risk treatment decision making, the 
calculation of the residual risk—all these should be part of the monitoring 
and review exercise. 
8.2.4  Monitoring and Review of Information Security Controls
There are defined in ISO/IEC 27001 many controls designed for different 
purposes: management, human resource, policies and procedures, auditing, 
conformance, physical and technical. Again, regular monitoring and review 
of controls enables the organisation to keep track of its performance and 
to take appropriate action to implement improvements to the controls as 
and when necessary. For example, an acceptable use policy may be poorly 
written, vague and confusing regarding what is and what is not allowable 
behaviour regarding email usage. Several incidents have occurred whereby 
users have accidently misused the email system with the root cause seem­
ing to be this poorly written policy. Another example might be monitoring 
the level of resources needed to deal with the day-to-day management of 
some of the ISMS processes. If we consider the incident management pro­
cess as a case in question and the level of team resources needed to do the 
work: it might be that the number of incidents is steadily increasing or the 
organisation is experiencing very high bursts of activity. This might demand 
extra skilled support for the existing incident team either on a full-time 
basis or a part-time basis, whatever the situation monitoring demand is for 
ISMS human resource. In some critical cases, this could mean the differ­
ence between survival and complete disruption and failure. Monitoring the 
needs and requirements across all areas of ISMS activity is important.
There are many management controls in ISO/IEC 27001, including 
controls of the policies and procedures, all of which can be the subject of 
some form of monitoring. Documentation, such as policies and procedures, 
will be created, approved, used in day-to-day operations and at some point 
in time they need to be updated and reviewed. This is normal practice, 
and part of ISO/IEC 27001 conformance. Monitoring is highly necessary 
to check that all ISMS-related documentation is suitable and adequate; is 
available to all those that need to have access; is suitably and effectively 
protected; has adequate suitable version control; and is adequately and ef­
fectively stored, archived and disposed of as is necessary.   
Some controls, such as those that are underpinned by the use of IT, may 
be monitored using automated or semi-automated means (e.g., software 
used for monitoring unauthorized access or detecting intrusions or for gen­
erating audit trails). 

8.2  Monitoring and Operational Reviews 
153
8.2.5  Monitoring and Review of IT and Network Services and 
Infrastructure
ISO/IEC 27001 is not an IT security standard; it is an information security 
management standard. It deals directly with the security of information, not 
directly with IT security or network security. Nevertheless, IT and network­
ing services and infrastructure is today a significant management tool and 
as such, like other management support and business tools, methods and 
processes, it too has implications on the effectiveness, adequacy and suit­
ability of the organisation’s ISMS. 
When monitoring and reviewing ISMS use and application of IT and 
networking services and infrastructure, the following are some of the things 
that need to be covered:

 User and management policies and procedures that include the secure 
and acceptable use and application of IT and network resources, user 
access management, secure information processing involving the use 
of IT, business communications and transactions using network serv­
ices and so on;

 Information security management aspects related to the use of busi­
ness, operational and application software;

 Information security management related to the use of IT for business 
processes;

 Information security incident management related to the use of IT and 
networks services and infrastructure;

 Information security management aspects related to the use of IT and 
networks services and infrastructure for business continuity, availabil­
ity and resilience.
8.2.6  Monitoring and Reviewing Third Party Contracts and Services 
8.2.6.1  Supplier Relationships and Service Management
The majority of organisations have third-party suppliers of a range of dif­
ferent services. Management of supplier relations and service delivery espe­
cially considering how services are implemented, operated and maintained 
also involves consideration of information security. 
The organisation should have a policy in place that covers the informa­
tion security risks regarding the use of suppliers and the protection of the 
organisation’s information.

154 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
Also, information security should be addressed in contracts and SLAs 
with suppliers to ensure that the organisations’ requirements are being 
addressed. 
Both the policy and the contract/SLA should address the risks related to 
the supply IT services and products.
The information security policy, contracts and SLAs should be revised 
on a regular basis, and of course more immediately if there have been any 
changes or requests for changes (reduce or expand its current services, re­
vise the current level of service, or add new services). Another reason for 
revising the contract and SLA is if there have been service-related incidents 
that would require a reassessment of the risks.
Monitoring and reviewing of third-party services might include check­
ing and evaluating records of service performance, service levels, and any 
problems in not achieving the requirements of the SLAs, risk levels, service 
recovery and any incidents that may have occurred. 
Clearly the organisation’s risk assessment and risk treatment solutions 
regarding service management needs to be reviewed on a regular basis. 
In addition, monitoring the levels of information security risk and impact 
need care and attention to ensure the ISMS still delivers the desired results 
effectively.
Another aspect is the auditing of the supplier’s system to check for com­
pliance against what has been agreed between the contracted parties. The 
right to audit the supplier’s system is something that needs to be agreed 
between all parties involved—the client and the supplier(s). Such an agree­
ment needs to be included in the service contract, and of course this might 
stipulate various conditions and restrictions. Some organisations have in­
cluded this right to audit as part of the tendering process, and some organi­
sations have made third-party certification audits (Chapter 10) a condition 
of the tender.
8.2.6.2  Monitoring and Reviewing Service Provider Changes 
Any changes on the supplier side needs to be communicated to the organi­
sation so they can review whether these will impact them. There will always 
be a need for IT changes at the service provider end. Maybe their success 
has secured them more business with existing clients or new clients to meet 
the increase in demand for IT facilities and services. It might be the case 
that the provider wants to make changes to stay ahead of its competitors 
and to be number one in its field of outsourcing, replacing outdated systems 
or by introducing changes to improve, streamline and/or make more cost 
effective its operations. Whatever the reason, ICT changes might involve 
all or some of it hardware, software, operational environments, manage­
ment tools, networking arrangements, connections and services to change. 

8.2  Monitoring and Operational Reviews 
155
Conveying these changes to its clients through regular channels of com­
munications and reporting helps both sides to reassess the risks and plan 
for any changes that might directly affect the client. This type of reporting 
should be in the existing contract, and a contract review process needs to be 
initiated to discuss, negotiate and agree on any amendments or modifica­
tions to the contract. 
8.2.6.3  Termination of Contract
There are several reasons for terminating a contract: supplier is unable or 
not willing to expand it services, costs and value for money or lack of in­
formation security. It might be that the service provider is taken over or 
merged with other suppliers, which might present a greater security risk or 
simply that the service goes out of business, or the supplier has decided to 
subcontract the work to a supplier located in a high risk area. It might be 
that the organisation switches suppliers for information security reasons. 
Whatever the scenario, there are several information security aspects to 
be considered. If a termination does go ahead, how is the organisation going 
to protect its information assets between finishing one contract and starting 
the next? Does it have the skills in house to protect and manage itself dur­
ing the transition? The organisation needs to take note that in any transi­
tion between suppliers all parties need to be involved to ensure a relatively 
problem-free changeover, especially to ensure no glitch in the continuation 
of its operations. 
The business continuity and availability issues need to be addressed re­
garding change in suppliers/providers to ensure that during the transition 
period there is adequate, effective and suitable protection of organisation’s 
information assets.
8.2.7  Monitoring and Review of Legal and Contractual Compliance
ISO/IEC 27001 specifies that the legal and regulatory requirements per­
tained to the ISMS need to be taken into account. This also includes con­
tractual requirements and obligations. It is vital that an organisation moni­
tors and reviews and keeps track of its compliance with those laws and 
regulations that apply to it, reviewing and reassessing the risks and making 
changes to the ISMS where relevant and appropriate.
With multinational organisations, there is of course potentially more 
legal and regulatory requirements to keep track of and to comply with. In 
addition, when trading across the Internet between jurisdictions, there may 
be several laws and regulations that might apply. 
In all cases, the organisation needs to make sure that its ISMS imple­
mentation, like all other aspects of operations, should be compliant with 

156 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
all relevant laws and regulations. The impact, for example, in terms of legal 
penalties, fines, legal punishments for individual company officers, damage 
to image and so on for failing to comply can be very severe. So knowing what 
the organisation should comply with and what controls it needs to imple­
ment in this respect is part of its conformance with the ISMS specification.
8.3  ISMS Measurements Programme
8.3.1  ISMS Metrics and Measurements
8.3.1.1  Metrics and Measurements
A metric is a standard or a system of measurement, and a measurement is 
the result of measuring something against a metric. For example, we have 
the litre as a standard for measuring the capacity of liquid, seconds as a 
measurement of time or degrees Celsius as a measurement of temperature.
In terms of information security, there are many types of metrics or 
measures that can be defined (e.g., the number in percentage of system 
vulnerabilities that are resolved within a defined time after set discovery 
time, or the number in percentage of incidents that are resolved within a 
defined time after set discovery time). Another example might be the effec­
tiveness of the security help desk: number (%) of calls received, answered 
or abandoned; average query processing time and average waiting time; 
number (%) of resolved/unresolved problems; user/customer satisfaction. 
Whatever metrics are selected they need to be appropriate to the organi­
sation’s requirements to deliver and maintain an effective, adequate and 
suitable ISMS. 
8.3.1.2  ISMS Measurements 
In terms of the ISMS, the organisation needs to define what metrics/mea­
sures it needs to use, and how, when, where and by whom/what measure­
ments are to be taken. The selection of metrics/measures is entirely in the 
hands of the organisation, as is the how, when, where and what regarding 
the measurements. Of course, it must always be focused on the aim of tak­
ing measurements (i.e., to check the performance of the ISMS with regard 
to its effectiveness, adequacy and suitability). These measurements will pro­
vide valuable input regarding the monitoring and review of the ISMS and 
consequently help to determine what improvements need to be made to 
the ISMS. 
Taking measurements and analyzing them is a mandatory requirement 
of ISO/IEC 27001 if an organisation wishes to claim conformance with this 
standard. In addition, taking measurements has many business benefits 
for the organisation (e.g., it greatly assists in managing the risks and the 

8.3  ISMS Measurements Programme 
157
allocation of resource and budget toward controlling the risks). It also helps 
to demonstrate conformance (i.e., the organisation is meeting the needs 
and expectations of interested parties). It also helps to increase accountabil­
ity and to check implementation. 
8.3.1.3  Example Areas of Measurements 
Measurements can help to indicate the extent to which the ISMS is deliver­
ing the desired and expected results (effectiveness), the extent to which the 
ISMS it is achieving an acceptable level of quality with regard to informa­
tion security protection (adequacy) and the extent to which the ISMS is 
right and appropriate for the organisation (suitability).
The following are some example areas to illustrate possible ISMS 
measurements.
Management Processes 

 Effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of the process for the ongoing 
determination of the requirements, needs, expectations for, and issues 
related to the ISMS;

 Effectiveness and adequacy of ongoing leadership and support for the 
ISMS; 

 Effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of internal and external com­
munications on all issues, news, changes and improvements related to 
the ISMS;

 Effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of the ISMS documentation 
system, including its protection, completeness, currency, availability, 
distribution, changes and updates.

specifics such as number of observations and nonconformances found, 
whether they are major or minor nonconformances and closure rates 
for nonconformances;

 Gap analyses and reviews of process and control implementation—
checking the gaps and weaknesses in the implementation;

 Effectiveness of management reviews.

8.3  ISMS Measurements Programme 
159
Economics, Investments and Risk/Impact Costs

 Information security budgets and resources;

 Cost/benefit analyses regarding investing in information security ver­
sus impacts; 

 Incident management, disaster recovery and business continuity costs; 
costs of recovery; cost of replacement; legal costs;, contractual penal­
ties; costs against impact analyses and other costs with information 
security dependencies.
8.3.2  Measurement Programme
8.3.2.1  Programme Design Objectives 
An ISMS measurements programme should be designed to provide the or­
ganisation with the following: 

 A valued assessment as to how well they are doing, how well the 
ISMS processes and controls are being utilizing and how well they are 
performing; 

 Set benchmarks and performance indicators to be set;

 Better informed decision making about the ISMS effectiveness, ade­
quacy and suitability; risk treatment solutions; making improvements;

 Demonstrate to CEO, directors, senior management, interested par­
ties and the board the value of the ISMS in the sense that risks and 
impacts are being managed effectively to achieve the desired ISMS 
results, there is an adequate level of protection provided by the ISMS, 
the ISMS is suitable to meet the organisation’s needs and that it re­
mains so. 
Taking measurements should be seen as an activity of great import to­
ward achieving, maintaining and improving ISMS effectiveness, adequacy 
and suitability. The measurements activity needs to be linked with the mon­
itoring activity, as measurements should be taken on things that are be­
ing monitored for effectiveness, adequacy or suitability. Therefore, all that 
was said in Section 8.2 applies here in Section 8.3. Equally monitoring and 
measurements are tied into the management reviews, as we will discuss in 
Section 8.5.

160 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
One way to interpret the requirements in Chapter 9 of ISO/IEC 27001 
on performance evaluation is to say that the organisation needs to take into 
account the following:

 A set of metrics (predefined standards of measurements—types of 
measures) to take measurements against must be defined.

 Part of the task of defining a measurement system will be to define the 
information security targets and thresholds—key performance indica­
tors and how these targets are calculated, reviewed and updated, bear­
ing in mind that measurements should be objective, reliable, accurate, 
repeatable, verifiable, relevant and quantifiable against the business 
targets.

 Which processes, procedures and methods need to be utilized to take 
and evaluate these measurements.

 The frequency of taking measurements—when measurements should 
be taken, which staff members are allocated the task of doing meas­
urements and who needs to ensure they are taken (bearing in mind 
that some measurements could be manual, semi-automated or auto­
mated). 

 When the measurements need to be checked, assessed, analysed, 
evaluated and reviewed, and which staff members are allocated this 
job function. 
8.3.2.2  Measurement Methods 
The standard ISO/IEC 27001 does not define any measurement methods, as 
the number of ways of taking measurements is numerous. Also a measure­
ment system is very dependent on the organisation’s internal standards, 
processes, modes of working and business culture. It is likely that the organ­
isation will have performance evaluation exercises in other areas of their 
business (e.g., project management, quality management or problem man­
agement). The methods used in these other areas for performance evalu­
ation might well be adopted for ISMS use. But again this depends entirely 
on the organisation and its senior management to decide which methods, 
metrics and measurement systems should be adopted to satisfy the require­
ments of ISO/IEC 27001.
Some data management methods do apply to the process of measure­
ments and can be used for the gathering and collection of measurement 
data, and some methods can also help in checking the quality, integrity and 
validity of the measurement data. But again it should be emphasized that 

8.3  ISMS Measurements Programme 
161
it is up to the organisation to decide and manage its measurements systems 
and which methods are adequate and suitable for its own use. It should also 
be emphasized that the monitoring and measurement systems and methods 
used are themselves a subject for performance evaluation. This means that 
whatever metrics, methods and the who, when and how of taking mea­
surements also comes under the scrutiny of being assessed and reviewed, as 
improvements may well be necessary if the monitoring and measurement 
system that is adopted is itself not performing well (i.e., it is proving to be 
ineffective, not adequate or unsuitable). So the monitoring and measure­
ment system needs to be reviewed at planned intervals to check its effec­
tiveness, adequacy and suitability.  
8.3.2.3  Protection of Data
It is important to note that some of the data being collected as part of the 
monitoring and measurement exercise may contain details of real or poten­
tial weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the organisation’s operational systems 
and processes. As such, this type of sensitive data, in the form of records and 
other documentation, needs to be adequately protected to avoid leakage, 
unauthorised access and unauthorised modification. 
8.3.2.4  Data Gathering and Collection 
What we will present here is some of the basic methods of gathering infor­
mation for measuring performance. It is frequently said that an organisa­
tion only gets what it measures, so if it does not measure the right things, 
set the most suitable performance targets and indicators or ask the most ap­
propriate questions, it may not arrive at the right answers to tell it how well 
its ISMS is performing. Of course, this is easier said than done; hence the 
reason to use continual improvement, which helps to monitor, review and 
improve processes, including those used for measurements. Therefore, care 
and attention in the design of these methods and measurements will avoid 
unnecessary work and provide more appropriate decision-making results.
Additionally, the quality, integrity and validity of data depends on the 
sample taken (e.g., a poor sample, a small sample or a sample that is not 
truly representative of a particular aspect of the ISMS). If the results of the 
measurement programme are to be useful, adequate and suitable to be of 
benefit to the organisation, then the data needs to be collected from a truly 
representative, statistically significant, consistent sample. 
Another important thing to bear in mind is that the exercise of data 
gathering/collection and measurements thereof should not interfere with 
business operations.

162 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
As already mentioned, data gathering could be manual, semi-automat­
ed or automated. 
8.3.2.5  Measurement Templates and Examples
Some organisations use a predefined template for recording measurements. 
Each type of measurement would have its own predefined template cover­
ing a definition of the metric being used, the ISMS objective of the metric, 
details of the measurement to be taken against this metric, the type of mea­
sure (e.g., measure of effectiveness, adequacy and/or suitability), the per­
formance target associated with this measurement, the range and type of 
data to be collected for this measurement, the frequency of measure, who is 
the owner and other interested parties for this measurement). 
For example, a measure is defined by the organisation regarding the 
effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of its ISMS training and awareness 
programme. Goals are to have a staff members with knowledge, working 
experience and operational competence in the use of ISMS processes and 
controls; that the training they have received is effective, adequate and 
suitable for their job functions, their related roles and responsibilities; the 
measure is a percentage of effectiveness, percentage of adequacy and per­
centage of suitability as determined by a test, examination and operational 
demonstration; the percentage targets are set by the organisation; the mea­
surements are carried after each planned training session (e.g., quarterly); 
the interested parties are human resources, head of training and training 
managers and line managers. 
8.3.2.6  Incident Management and Other Reports
Incident handling reports provide a wealth of data regarding the state of 
the ISMS to protect the organisation’s information. These reports will have 
details covering what the incident problem is, its nature and characteristics, 
how and why the incident happened, which systems and process were af­
fected and what was needed to recover from the incident. Incident reports 
over a period of time provide data on the trends and patterns of incidents, 
their type and nature. This trend information provides valuable measure­
ment data (e.g., unauthorised access attempts; how many attempts there 
have been and how many were successful, access to which parts of the or­
ganisation and its systems and processes were attempted, types of damage 
incurred, which systems or processes were compromised and other types 
of information). All this data and information, of this incident and all other 
incidents, provide indications as to whether the ISMS provides adequate 
protection, whether this protection is effective and whether this protec­
tion is suitable in the context of the organisation’s business and the needs 

8.3  ISMS Measurements Programme 
163
of interested parties. It is therefore essential that the incident management 
documentation and records is kept, since this system will contain substan­
tial volumes of data that the measurements programme could use.  
8.3.2.7  Scorecards and Questionnaires
Scorecards (especially balanced scorecards) provide a means to measure the 
performance of key business processes against business strategy and objec­
tives. For example, the scorecard could be used to measure the performance 
of the incident handling processes against the ISMS objectives referred to 
earlier. This might consider score questions related to the following: 

 Incidents reported and resolved over a period time relating to unusual 
web site behaviour, adware, spyware, phishing and other similar is­
sues across different parts of the organisation;

 How long it took; 

 Time spent recovering from system downtimes, failures and/or una­
vailability of network services;

 Time spent in correcting user errors in data entry and processing ac­
tivities.
The results of using scorecards provide management with a snapshot 
of how effective the risk management controls are. It is a tool that can be 
used alongside other methods that have been mentioned to complement 
the contribution of information gathering during the monitoring and re­
viewing process.
Scorecards should be used on a regular or periodic basis to get the most 
benefit and to support the continuing pursuit of effective information secu­
rity through the process of continual improvement.
Equally any security questionnaires asking questions about ISMS use 
and implementation also provides measurement data. If the questionnaire 
is well designed with targeted questions of particular interest to the mea­
surements programme, then the answers provide another source of useful 
data.
8.3.2.8  Tests and On-the-Job Exercises 
Testing and exams are one method of collecting data to measure perfor­
mance related to the human resources aspects of ISMS. These are designed 
to test the knowledge and understanding of staff members with regard to 
the ISMS they are using. This might be testing knowledge of a set of policies 
and procedures with example exercises and problems to solve on typical 

164 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
work scenarios. On-the-job training and at-the-desk exercises test the use 
and application of ISMS processes and controls. 
Benchmarking is a useful tool, as it can provide a means of comparing 
different parts of the business based on a set of metrics aligned to the objec­
tives, needs and expectations of the interested parties involved in the ISMS 
with regard to the effectiveness of their information security and their level 
of conformance and progress. It can also be used to evaluate and check how 
a company is doing with its information security with respect to other com­
panies working in the same line of business or in the same industry sector.
Benchmarks provide an innovative way of viewing information secu­
rity as a business enabler across different areas of the business identifying 
areas for improvement, integration, streamlining and greater efficiency and 
productivity.
8.3.2.9  Gap Analysis and Benchmarking Methods
Gap analysis is another assessment tool that enables an organisation to com­
pare its actual information security profile with what it needs to be com­
pliant with and/or the security objectives and targets it wants to achieve, 
and to compare the actual performance with its potential performance. The 
organisation can use this to check against predefined metrics and targets 
aligned with the organisation’s objectives, needs and expectations and that 
of all the interested parties involved in the ISMS. This provides the organi­
sation with measurements of conformance against set targets (e.g., check­
ing the extent of implementation and operational usage of the standard 
principles of privacy as set out in ISO/IEC 29100). This gap analysis will 
provide insight into areas where there is room for improvement. 
The gap analysis process provides a means of determining and docu­
menting the variances between the target ISMS business objectives, needs, 
expectations, requirements, and what is actually implemented in the ISMS. 
There are many uses of gap analysis:

 Pre–risk assessment to check what controls and processes are currently 
in place;

 Post–risk assessment, treatment and selection of controls activities and 
actions;

 Checking status of implementations, actions and status related to 
management reviews and improvements;

 During ongoing risk management activities such risk reassessments;

 Precertification audits as well as internal audits and reviews;

8.3  ISMS Measurements Programme 
165

 Checking operational conformance with ISMS policies and procedures;

 ISMS asset management;

 Protection of information lifecycle management;

 Incident management applications;

 Business impact analyses;

 ISMS resource allocation, provisioning and management.
The granularity of the analysis can vary in several ways for example:

 Targets of conformance complete (C), semicomplete (S), partial (P) or 
zero (Z);

 The number of questions asked to establish the level of conformance 
can also vary.
The greater the granularity of analysis, the more precise the results are 
likely to be. The following example illustrates this idea.
For example, let us assume that the organisation carries out measure­
ments on its service and supplier relationships. The purpose of this is to 
check that the controls in place to protect the organisation’s assets, includ­
ing its information assets, are effective, adequate and suitable. A single 
question to assess whether the organisation has an information security 
policy in place for each of its suppliers would be: 

 Has the organisation an information security policy in place to cover 
the risks associated with access to its information assets by service 
providers?
This question is very simple and gives no indication of whether policy 
specifics are complied with. So an expanded set to several questions might 
be used to give a greater degree of measurement of conformance of the 
specifics of the policy:

 Does the organisation’s information security policy for service pro­
viders cover controls related to the protection of the confidentiality 
integrity of organisation’s information?

 Does the organisation’s information security policy for service provid­
ers cover controls related to the protection of all personally identifiable 
information that the organisation has?

 Does the organisation’s information security policy for service provid­
ers cover controls related to incident management?

ers cover controls to ensure availability of resources used to process 
information and of information itself?

 Does the organisation’s information security policy for service provid­
ers cover monitoring the quality of service provided?
8.3.2.10  Automated Data Collection and Processing
Of course, manual data collection, although inevitable for a number of 
measurement exercises, is not necessarily the most efficient. In order to add 
greater efficiency the use of automated tools for data collection and process­
ing is far better.
Now there are several ways automation can be used. Clearly, having 
most of the methods mentioned earlier automated is definitely possible. 
For example, scorecards, questionnaires and sometimes gap analyses can 
be done online and so all the results are in electronic form, which makes 
processing, analysis and future use and application easier. 
Other forms of automated data collection relates to reporting of inci­
dents, problems, errors, vulnerabilities and customer feedback; although 
these may not directly relate to any measurement exercise per se, they are 
Figure 8.1  Risk review cycles.

8.3  ISMS Measurements Programme 
167
data that is useful in the broader scheme of things and do constitute a mea­
sure of the effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of the ISMS.
There are indeed software tools that are specifically designed to collect 
data, analyse data and present results. IDS software provides indications of 
traffic and user behaviour against predefined patterns of behaviour; fire­
walls and other network technologies also provide data related to network 
usage, behaviour, problems and so on. IT has audit trails built in that pro­
vide data on user access to files, applications and services, systems and vari­
ous other things.
So automated data collection, processing and analysis lends itself to be­
ing an integral part of a measurements programme. However, not all of the 
work that is needed for an ISMS measurement programme can be automat­
ed, since much of the ISMS is about people, management, and the use and 
application of information. Putting automation and IT in context, we can 
say it is an extremely important business tool designed to make processing 
of information more efficient, but we cannot totally automate the human 
aspect, from a usage, behavioural and application perspective. 
8.3.2.11  Measurements in Practice
A number of key points should be kept in mind by the organisation in de­
signing an effective measurement programme, such as the following:

 Value and purpose:

 Provides a measure of performance of the effectiveness, adequa­
cy and suitability of the ISMS against the organisation’s objec­
tives and the needs and expectations of all interested parties;

 Provides an understanding of possible risks (new risks or changes 
to existing identified risks), and provides an indication that more 
controls are needed or existing processes and/or controls need 
improvements;

 Helps in monitoring the ISMS and provides essential information 
for the management reviews;

 Identifies problem areas where improvements could be made;

 Identifies areas where the performance is below par.

 Type, quantity, quality and timeliness:

 Make sure the measurements are relevant and a sufficient 
number of measurements are taken regularly and at the right 
time,

 Make sure you are not measuring too many things that are not 
used—the measurement programme needs to be focused, con­

168 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
sider what is relevant, the critical parts and potential risks of the 
ISMS;

 Make sure imprecise measurements or irrelevant measurements 
are not being taken.

 Use and interpretation of measurements:

 Make sure measurements are being undertaken with a clear goal 
in mind;

 Make sure all those who are asked to provide input understand 
the purpose and relevance; 

 Right use (e.g., to gain a better understanding the state of the 
ISMS). 
It is important that whatever metrics are used and whatever measure­
ment system is in place to measure against these metrics will deliver mean­
ingful, useful and timely results. There is always room for improvements, as 
this is the nature of change and this is why monitoring and measurements 
play an important role in the lifetime of an ISMS. No one can get a mea­
surement programme fully correct from the word go, and it is unlikely that 
such a goal in reality can ever be attained because of change. Therefore, 
the measurement programme itself needs to be reviewed and evaluated, 
especially the relevance of the metrics being used, the method of taking 
measurements, the frequency of measurements, and so on.
8.4  Ongoing Risk Management
8.4.1  Risk Responsiveness and Commitment
This chapter is about ISMS performance evaluation, and at the heart of this 
like all other aspects of the ISMS is the topic of risk—we cannot get away 
or remove ourselves from this important and critical topic. Measurements 
might inform us that there is a problem with the ISMS (i.e., there are risks 
that are causing this problem): new risks, variants of old risks or an old risk 
that has become more virulent, hostile, more likely or carrying a greater im­
pact. In such a case, the organisation needs to reassess its risks. At the same 
time, a risk assessment, in and of itself, is a measurement of how good the 
ISMS is in terms of effectiveness, adequacy and suitability. 
Taking suitable action and being responsive to manage the informa­
tion security risks an organisation faces is crucial to achieving an effective, 
adequate and suitable ISMS. The processes of risk assessment, risk treat­
ment and selection of controls constitute the first phase of the risk con­
trol procedure (as discussed in Chapter 4). The second phase encompasses 
implementing the controls and supporting actions to put in place a system 

8.4  Ongoing Risk Management 
169
of controls and getting them deployed in the ISMS (as discussed in Chapters 
5–7), and the third phase involves keeping ahead, being present with the 
latest changes, being responsive to changes where appropriate and main­
taining an effective information security regime (the topic of this chapter).
At all stages of the risk management process, there needs to be a firm 
commitment from senior management, operational managers and staff. All 
have a part to play to counter the threats and incidents that result in un­
wanted business risks and impacts. Table 8.2 shows a simplified view of 
typical levels of commitment and responsibilities.
8.4.2  Regular Risk Assessments
From time to time, the organisation’s risk profile needs to be reviewed and 
updated. This is essential to keep up with changes, to make improvements 
and to maintain an effective, adequate and suitable ISMS implementation. 
It is a key part of the continual improvement process (Chapter 9).
This means that risk assessments should be carried out on a regular ba­
sis. In addition, assessing the risk will also be needed in the case of a major 
incident or change in the business. This will include reviewing the current 
status of previously identified risks and impacts as well as considering new

risks and impacts. The risk register will then need to be updated. As an ex­
ample this would typically include the following:

 Previously identified risks and impacts:

 Review, reassess and recalculate previously identified risks and 
impacts, checking levels and status appropriateness, 

 Add, modify and/or delete entries or details of all relevant 
changes in the risk register. 

 Newly identified risks and impacts:

 Assess newly identified risks, taking account information con­
tained in incident reports; audit reports; security reviews; cus­
tomer, user and management feedback and reports; any changed 
conditions and any new risk relevant information;

 Calculate the impacts related to the new risks. 

 Reassess the risk priorities.
8.4.3  Risk Measurements and Metrics
Different types of metrics and measurements are available that relate to the 
risk management–based process.
Quantitative metrics and measurements are based on the use of statisti­
cal or historical data and monetary values. This includes assets where real 
quantities can be used to associate damage directly with some numerical 
value:

 Cost of recovering from a system failure, virus attack, denial of service 
and other incidents;

 Cost of replacing a damaged system or piece of equipment;

 Reliability figures of equipment or component failures (e.g., MTBF);

 Records relating to system down times, access attempts, network data 
(e.g., transmission delays, access delays, call and session drops and er­
ror rates); 

 Statistics relating to earthquakes, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, flood­
ing, typhoons and other natural threats, pandemics and so on.
Some assets are difficult to assign a quantitative risk measure to (e.g., 
information itself, company image and reputation, the skills of human re­
sources or the competence of the attacker and their capacity and resources 

8.5  ISMS Internal Audits 
171
for carrying out the attack). Therefore, quantitative methods for ISMS risks 
and measurement are not always possible to apply due to lack the data 
available, in which case qualitative methods are normally applied.
Qualitative metrics and measurements do not involve the use of statisti­
cal or historical data but use a grading system such as low, medium, high 
and very high to express the value of the risk, impact or likelihood. Al­
though this may seem an imprecise method, it is generally a good method 
to deal with the broad range of objects being dealt with in ISMS—people, 
management, processes and information. Hence, qualitative methods are 
generally more suited to an ISMS since there is often more uncertainty 
in assessing the information security environment. In practice, the com­
plexity of information security issues requires a combination of qualitative 
and quantitative assessments, especially as the assets will cover tangible and 
nontangible, management and nonmanagement asset types. 
Semi-quantitative methods address the need to express qualitative mea­
surements in the form of numbers (e.g., low risk = 0, medium risk = 1, high 
risk = 2 and very high risk = 3). The numbers themselves can be further 
quantified in more meaningful terms, such as monetary values, degrada­
tion in levels of service and availability, reduction in performance levels and 
decrease in efficiency and productivity output.
8.5  ISMS Internal Audits
�To comply with ISO/IEC 27001, organisations need to conduct internal 
audits. The purpose of an internal audit is to check whether the ISMS satis­
fies the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001. This will consider the effectiveness, 
adequacy and suitability of the ISMS. This audit might identify weak links 
and gaps in the ISMS and potential opportunities for improvements. 
These audits should be carried out at planned intervals as part of an au­
dit programme. Each audit should have an audit plan that details the objec­
tives and scope of the audit, the audit criteria. The objectives of the audit is 
determining what needs to be achieved by the audit, including conformity 
of the ISMS with the audit criteria, and determining whether the ISMS 
meets the relevant legislative, regulatory or contractual requirements. The 
audit scope will define the extent and limits of the audit—the parts of the 
ISMS that are to be covered: which activities, systems, processes, controls, 
locations, business units and so on. The audit criteria shall include the re­
quirements in ISO/IEC 27001 and any standards or requirements specific 
to the organisation. 
The audit shall be carried out by a qualified ISMS auditor or team of 
ISMS auditors, depending on the size and extent of the audit scope. A quali­
fied ISMS auditor (or auditor team) will have the necessary knowledge, 

172 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
skills, competence and audit experience to undertake ISMS audits. If there 
is an audit team, then the team will be headed by a lead auditor, and typi­
cally the lead auditor should have several more years of experience in ISMS 
auditing. Those that carry our ISMS audits should not have been involved 
in the development of the ISMS or have any current involvement in ISMS 
activities. In other words, they need to avoid any conflicts of interest and 
they need to remain impartial. It is only through the impartiality of the 
audit that confidence and trust in the results can be assured. Internal ISMS 
audits, and third-party certification audits, therefore need to be objective, 
unbiased, free of prejudice, balanced and fair. 
The general audit process, which is applicable to internal audits, is de­
scribed in Chapter 10. Also, more details and guidance on audits can be 
found in ISO 19011, ISO 17021 and ISO/IEC 27007.
The results and findings of the internal audit, documented in an audit 
report, are provided as input to the management review meetings (Section 
8.6). The results also provide feedback to the senior management and in­
terested parties.
Internal audits are a key element in the monitoring and review process, 
and they are a useful management tool for identifying problems, risks and 
nonconformities related to the ISMS.
8.6  Management Reviews of the ISMS
8.6.1  Management Review
Another aspect of the performance evaluation exercise is management re­
view of the ISMS. Senior management shall have management reviews reg­
ularly at planned intervals. The purpose of these, like that of the overall aim 
of performance evaluation, is to check the effectiveness, adequacy and suit­
ability of the ISMS. These meetings need to review all relevant information: 
reports from audits and security assessments and results of measurements, 
risk assessments, feedback, changes affecting the organisation, changes to 
requirements and consideration of other types of input that might have an 
impact on the effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of the ISMS.
These meetings should be attended by interested parties and all those 
who need to report into such meetings, because of their ISMS job func­
tion or because of an action that was placed on them (e.g., by past meet­
ings). Others might need to attend these meetings, not on a regular basis 
but where a specific agenda item requires their specific skills or knowledge 
about a relevant ISMS subject.
The agenda and minutes of these meetings shall be documented: this 
should be a record of discussions, decisions, actions and recommendations 
for ISMS improvements. 

8.6  Management Reviews of the ISMS 
173
8.6.2  Input for the Management Review
Gathering information concerning changes should be part of an organisa­
tion’s monitoring, review and reporting process. The organisation can get 
information, for example, from the following
8.6.2.1  Incident Handling Records
These records can provide information on the organisation’s ability to resist 
against and respond to threats to its information systems. These records are 
a valuable source of information regarding the effectiveness of the organisa­
tion’s ISMS. Regular reviews of this information is essential to keeping up 
to date regarding the organisation’s responsiveness and preparedness for 
threats and attacks. Incident handling is key to the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS 
process.
8.6.2.2  ISMS Measurements
Setting up metrics, a measurement programme and performance indicators 
is key to the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS process. How effective, adequate and 
suitable are the leadership and support controls that management have in 
place? Is the training and awareness programme effective? How effective is 
the management of human resources? How effective is the incident han­
dling process? How well does IT backup perform? How good is the perfor­
mance of the access control system to withstand attacks from external net­
works? These and many other questions can lead us to judge how effective 
our ISMS is at managing risks based on what we measure.
8.6.2.3  Scorecards, Gap Analysis and Benchmarking Processes, Tools 
and Exercises
These methods, if used on a periodic basis across the organisation and by an 
appropriate number of staff, can provide a valuable source of information. 
They give a relatively easy way of determining whether security is being 
deployed, whether it is working and whether target levels are being met.
8.6.2.4  Internal Audits and Reviews and Third-Party Certification Audits
All forms of audits and reviews are important to determine if the ISMS is 
conforming to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001, and whether the system 
of controls to manage the risks have been properly implemented, deployed 
and maintained. It is also necessary to review other audit results and to 
provide reports to management on the status of information security within 
the organisation.

174 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
8.6.2.5  Feedback from Users, Employees, Customers and Suppliers
Often valuable information on the effectiveness of the organisation can be 
gotten from staff. Of course, this should be the case since they are in daily 
contact with the system of risk controls in place. They are using the proce­
dures that underpin the management and application of the information 
security measures in place. Also, customers and suppliers can sometimes 
provide useful information, both positive and negative, about the effective­
ness of the organisation’s measures to protect information.
8.6.3  Output of the Management Review
8.6.3.1  Recommendations for Improvement 
Gathering information and evaluating and analyzing it with respect to the 
effectiveness, adequacy and suitability of the organisation’s ISMS imple­
mentation is a key exercise and one that proves essential input into man­
agement review. The next phase is that of deciding whether improvements 
need to be made, based on this input. What is decided—the recommenda­
tions and the actions to be taken—are the main outputs of the management 
review. 
Any changes that are recommended should be to improve the ISMS—
to change the ISMS for the better. Of course, any changes to the ISMS to 
make improvements will have an influence and impact on the business. So 
any recommendations need to be carefully considered, for although it is 
aimed at improving the ISMS it may have other impacts on other parts of 
the organisation’s systems and processes. 
Recommendations may be made requiring corrective actions to resolve 
existing problems and to make improvements. It is also the opportunity to 
take preemptive actions (to implement preventative controls) to prevent 
further problems from occurring, either old problems reccurring or the an­
ticipation of new problems occurring. 
8.6.3.2  Action Plan
Any recommendations and actions to implement ISMS corrective and pre­
ventative actions to make ISMS improvements shall have full management 
commitment and support. An action plan needs to be produced with a pri­
oritisation of the work. After implementing the action plan, it needs to be 
confirmed that the new improvements are working effectively and are be­
ing deployed correctly in the working environment. Reworking, revising 
and updating the policies and procedures may need to be instituted. The 
improvement phase might need to confirm whether certain processes need 
to be improved and modified accordingly. 

8.7  Awareness and Communications 
175
It is not only ISMS controls that may need to be improved, but also the 
ISMS processes themselves that may need to be improved and overhauled—
the risk assessment and treatment process, the measurements programme 
and so on. This might entail changes to risk criteria, different methods of 
risk assessment deployed or new measures and performance indicators may 
need to be defined or existing ones modified. 
8.7  Awareness and Communications
Key to any action senior management might need to take, in this case with 
regard to ISMS improvements, is effective communication with all manag­
ers and staff and all interested parties: awareness and training and deploy­
ment of procedures. Users and employees need to be aware of the changes 
to implement the improvements and how these relate to their own job 
functions and the work responsibilities they have been assigned. Indeed, 
they need to practice deploying the procedures and processes they need to 
follow regarding the management of risk in their areas of work.
Retraining may need to take place if the improvements involve totally 
new controls or upgrades to existing controls, in particular with those staff 
members that are directly impacted by these changes. 
Communications need to be two-way. Management sets the policy and 
strategy, makes decisions and provides risk management resources. Users 
and staff on the other hand should be reporting back to management in­
cidents, giving feedback and providing information on potential risk situa­
tions and possible improvements to management; this is valuable input for 
the organisation itself and for making informed decisions on how best to 
manage risks and take the most appropriate course of action.

9.1  Continual Improvement
9.1.1  Improvement
The process of improvement is referred to as a 
continual improvement in ISO/IEC 27001:2013 
and is a mandatory aspect of conformance with 
this standard. ISMS continual improvement is 
a top management commitment that should be 
driven by the objectives set by top management 
to have an ISMS that is effective, adequate and 
suitable for its business purposes. This means to 
achieve continual improvement the organisa­
tion needs to consider the issues and require­
ments defined in ISO/IEC 27001:2013. This 
means to ensure that appropriate protection is 
in place to treat the risks—this could be infor­
mation security controls and processes to de­
tect, prevent, reduce and respond to undesired 
effects (e.g., from security incidents, breaches, 
disasters, compromises). It also implies that the 
ISMS produce the results and outputs that are 
expected.

178 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
The top management of the organisation should always be looking for 
opportunities for continual improvement. One aspects of this is through 
the organisation’s performance evaluation activities (e.g., from manage­
ment review meetings Clause 9.3 [ISO/IEC 27001:2013]). It might be the 
case that the organisation has received feedback from interested parties, 
such as its business partners or customers, on service delivery and avail­
ability. For example, business partners or customers might now be request­
ing information security requirements to be taken into account in addition 
to that already determined through a previous consideration of Clause 4.2 
(ISO/IEC 27001:2013). It might be that there are complaints or concerns 
from business partners about a recent spate of incidents the organisation 
was involved and they want to some reassurance that the organisation is 
doing something to improve its information security. For example, an or­
ganisation experiences an increase in the number of hours of operational 
down time and subsequently the unavailability of access to information for 
business processes. This problem then had an impact on business efficiency 
and customer dissatisfaction. After incident and problem analysis, it appears 
that the down time is due to the lack of availability of a number of busi­
ness processes that rely on IT systems. The cause of the problem is due to a 
lack of regular maintenance, which is subsequently due to a lack of human 
resources and prioritisation of jobs (i.e., maintenance of critical business 
systems). Improvements are clearly needed in this case, and action needs to 
be taken before the problem gets out of hand and the business disruption 
gets to a point where the impact is highly damaging to the organisation’s 
productivity, efficiency and reputation (in the case where the problem has 
an effect external customers).
It could be that during a management review the results of the moni­
toring and measurement activities has highlighted a number of areas where 
there is opportunity to improve the performance of the ISMS. This could 
equally be the case with the results of an internal audit or from external 
third party audits.
Therefore, maintaining and improving the effectiveness, suitability and 
adequacy of the ISMS is key to ensuring an appropriate level of protection 
of the organisation’s information. Its information policy and objectives are 
being conformed to be compatible with its business direction and strategy.
9.1.2  Maintaining Effectiveness, Suitability and Adequacy
If an organisation does nothing (i.e., does not make ISMS improvements), 
then the protection of its information will over a period of time loses its ef­
fectiveness. This may happen over a period of months, weeks or even days, 
and the longer the problem is left unattended, the greater the impact. As 

9.1  Continual Improvement 
179
discussed in Chapter 9, changes occur—some are in the organisation’s con­
trol and some not in its control. The degree of uncertainty regarding infor­
mation security risks in today’s fast changing business environment means 
that organisations need to be proactive and adaptive to the risks brought 
about by such changes. Improvements will need to be made to ensure the 
ISMS remains effective in the light of such changes and subsequent risks 
the organisation faces. The information security risks that organisations are 
being confronted with are growing in frequency and complexity. Because of 
the uncertainty of the risks involved, these might be caused by changes that 
are occurring monthly, weekly or daily in some cases. Improvements are 
necessary to keep up date with the changes to its risk profile. Some changes 
may not be classified as information security risks per se but nevertheless 
can have an impact on the organisation and the effectiveness of its ISMS to 
protect its information. These changes could be driven by external factors 
(e.g., changes to suppliers, environmental, infrastructure, conditions, legis­
lation or market conditions). The changes could also be driven by internal 
risk factors (e.g., changes in business policy, strategy, staff resources, merg­
ers, management decisions, or changes to technology).
Continual improvement is an essential element in the ISMS lifecycle 
through all the lifecycle stages of implementation, organisational and op­
erational deployment, monitoring, measurements, reviews, maintenance, 
keeping up to date and improving the ISMS to achieving effective informa­
tion security management.
9.1.3  Holistic Effectiveness
Continual improvement of the ISMS does not just mean improvement of 
the effectiveness of the information security controls or processes. The con­
cept applies to the overall ISMS itself. Continual improvement is also a re­
curring step-by-step activity of improvement and not a continuous process 
of improvement. This is important since the organisation needs to achieve 
the right balance between identifying when improvements are necessary 
and when they should be implemented (based on available resources and 
level on risk and business impact) as opposed to continually making im­
provements hour by hour, day by day. Clearly, if risks and impacts have 
been identified that could compromise the organisation and it ability to 
protect its information, then it needs to review its situation and take what­
ever action is most appropriate to manage the risk. Of course, if there has 
been a major incident, business crisis or emergency, which could have an 
immediate impact on the well being or survivability of the business, then 
action needs to be taken that may or may not involve ISMS improvements.

180 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
9.2  Conformance and Nonconformance
9.2.1  Nonconformity
An ISMS nonconformity is a nonfulfillment of a requirement of ISO/IEC 
27001:2013. This means a nonfulfillment of any of the “shall” requirement 
in ISO/IEC 27001:2013 is a nonconformity. For example, there is a require­
ment that management shall review the organisation’s ISMS at planned 
intervals. In fact, all the requirements in ISO/IEC 27001 include the word 
“shall.” The organisation shall do risk assessments according to a planned 
schedule, it shall undertake a risk treatment process to select the appropri­
ate options for treating the risks (managing the risks), it shall determine an 
appropriate set of controls and so on. (For the exact wording of these state­
ments the reader, is referred to the text in the standard itself.) One of the 
tasks of an audit (internal or third party) is to check whether there are any 
nonconformities, and if nonconformities are found then the organisation 
should do whatever is necessary to remove such nonconformities.
9.2.2  Corrections
Once a nonconformity has been detected or reported, then a correction 
can be implemented to eliminate the nonconformity or a corrective action 
can be taken to eliminate the cause of the nonconformity. For example, if 
a current policy does not conform to a requirement of the standard, then 
this problem could be corrected by replacing this policy with one that does 
conform. Likewise, if a staff awareness programme is insufficient and so 
results in a nonconformity, then the programme should be replaced with 
an improved programme.
9.2.3  Corrective Actions and Root Causes
In the case of corrective action, it is necessary to first determine the cause 
of the nonconformity. Determining this cause depends on the complexity 
of the problem. In some cases a simple brainstorming exercise is all that is 
needed; in other cases, the root cause may be found through considering 
several different contributing factors (a chain of cause and effects), and a 
more detailed analysis might be needed. The root cause might be a people, 
process, method, management or technical problem or a combination. The 
effectiveness of the corrective action will of course depend on whether the 
cause (or causes) have been correctly identified. The cause may have been 
accidental (a one-off mistake or error), or it might have been intention­
al or systematic, which could be a recurring problem if not dealt with. If 
the cause is not properly identified or analyzed, then a systematic cause 

9.2  Conformance and Nonconformance 
181
may treated as if it were a one-off problem or accident, and then there is a 
likelihood of the problem recurring.
After determining the cause(s) of the nonconformity, corrective action 
needs to be taken to eliminate the cause of the nonconformity. In general, 
then, the organisation’s response to a nonconformity should therefore be 
correction, cause analysis and corrective action or alternatively cause analy­
sis, correction and corrective action. But merely correcting an existing non­
conformity may not wholly resolve the problem—the root cause—and so a 
recurrence of the problem may happen.
9.2.4  Some Common Causes of Nonconformity
There is no definitive list of causes of nonconformities. The following are 
some examples of nonconformities:

 Management failure to understand the internal and external issues 
and the requirements of interested parties that are relevant to the 
ISMS, which subsequently may have an impact on delivering the 
expected outcomes of the ISMS in conformance with ISO/IEC 27001 
Clause 4.1 and 4.2; 

 Failure to adequately define the ISMS scope in conformance with ISO/
IEC 27001 Clause 4.3—especially a failure to properly address the 
interfaces and dependencies; 

 Lack of an adequate or effective risk assessment and treatment process 
in conformance with ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 6; 

 Management failure to commit to or to achieve continual improve­
ment of the ISMS ISO/IEC 27001 Clauses 5.2 and 6.1.1; 

 Lack of resources to support the ISMS in conformance with ISO/IEC 
27001 Clause 7; 

 Lack of training and awareness in conformance with ISO/IEC 27001 
Clause 7.3; 

 Failure to implement and control the processes necessary to effectively 
and adequately  address the risks and opportunities in conformance 
with ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 6; 

 Management failure to adequately address the requirements for per­
formance evaluation in conformance with ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 9, 
including failing to comply with internal audit results, lack of com­
mitment to management reviews and failure to determine a suitable 

182 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
programme of monitoring and measurements, all of which can fail  to 
identify opportunities for ISMS improvements.  
9.2.5  Case Study One  
An incident occurs regarding the operational use of security procedures to 
achieve the organisation’s security objectives. The incident is a failure to 
protect commercial information. A new inexperienced member of staff uses 
an “acceptable use” policy and procedure that was determined as necessary 
from a past risk assessment and risk treatment activity (ISO/IEC 27001 6.1.2 
and 6.1.3). The inexperienced member of staff sends sensitive commercial 
information unprotected in an email based on their interpretation of the 
policy. The initial reaction was that the use of the procedure by the inexpe­
rienced member of staff was the cause, but after reviewing the procedures 
it was found that the instructions given on this issue were unclear—in fact, 
poorly written. So improvements should be made involving revision of the 
procedures and, in addition, providing better training to new recruits (ISO/
IEC 27001 Clause 7.3).
9.2.6  Case Study Two
An auditor raises a nonconformity regarding management not providing 
the appropriate level of resource for the maintenance of the ISMS (ISO/IEC 
27001 Clause 7.1), in particular measurements for the evaluation of the 
performance of the ISMS. This results in a lack of appropriate input to the 
management review meetings (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 9.3.c). There is a lack 
of human resources to undertake performance measurements and to anal­
yse and evaluate the ISMS effectiveness as the cause of the problem. There­
fore, management needs to review this resourcing problem to improve the 
process of providing input on the performance of the ISMS to management 
review meetings.
9.2.7  Case Study Three
An incident occurs related to the organisation’s use of social media as part 
of its marketing campaign. In the risk assessment the organisation had iden­
tified, analysed and evaluated a number of risks (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 
6.1.2) relating to its use of social media for business purposes, and it subse­
quently determined a number of controls (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 6.1.3b) to 
treat and manage these risks. Unfortunately, after six months, the organi­
sation has still only implemented a few of these controls, leaving the or­
ganisation wide open to the risks assessed. The organisation, however, had 

9.3  Making Improvements 
183
failed to implement the controls (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 8.1) determined in 
(ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 6.1.3b) to achieve the organisation’s security objec­
tives (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 6.2). The lack of implementation of appro­
priate risk-based controls was the main cause of the incident (i.e., lack of 
controls that need to be implemented to treat the identified risks).
9.3  Making Improvements
9.3.1  Planning and Implementing Improvements
Information on what improvements are needed, when improvements 
should/can be carried out, and what resources are needed should all be 
documented as part of an improvement plan. The improvement process 
should ensure that:

 Improvements that are implemented are communicated to all inter­
ested parties; in particular, communicate to all those who need to 
know the details about the improvements (at a level of detail that is 
appropriate and relevant to them and their job function), whether it 
is regarding new security methods and measures, new/revised policies 
and procedures or other changes. Communications might not be just 
to internal staff but also might need to be to third parties, customers 
and other external parties who need to know about the changes (i.e., 
at a “need-to-know” level of detail that is appropriate and relevant to 
them in accordance with the contracts and SLAs in place) (see ISO/
IEC 27001 Clause 7.4). 

 Action is taken to revise and update policies and procedures where 
necessary and appropriate as part of achieving continual improve­
ment.

 Action is taken to revise processes where necessary and appropriate as 
part of achieving continual improvement (see ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 
8.1).

  Suitable awareness is undertaken to inform about the improvements. 
This might involve changes/revisions to policies and procedures, other 
risk controls or processes, and it might also involve giving some staff 
training (see ISO/IEC 27001 Clauses 7.2 and 7.3).

 There are adequate resources available to deploy and utilize the imple­
mented improvements (see ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 7.1). 

184 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
9.3.2  Improvements to Processes
There are various situations where processes need to be improved (e.g., 
where processes are not properly used or not followed, are difficult to use, 
are not well designed or implemented), and they can cause performance 
problems or result in nonconformities. It might be the case that the risk 
assessment process itself needs to be improved, as it is not producing con­
sistent or valid results. Another example might be the process that the or­
ganisation uses to communicate with external parties needs to be improved. 
Also, the processes that the organisation deploys for outsourcing are not 
properly or inadequately controlled. The internal audit process may need 
to be reviewed and improved to ensure that the impartially of audits are 
being maintained. There are many processes, both information security 
processes and business processes, where there could be opportunities for 
improvement.
9.3.3  Improvements to Policies and Procedures
There are various situations where policies and procedures need to be im­
proved. Policies and procedures may be written in ways that are confus­
ing or difficult to use; they may contain errors, mistakes or provide wrong 
information; they may be incomplete or not cover all possible situations; 
they might need updating to take into account new developments. All these 
factors can and do cause problems in achieving the organisation’s security 
objectives and the intended product of the ISMS. Is the information security 
policy appropriate to the organisation’s objectives and strategic mission? 
Does the policy cover the right things? Has the organisation a suitable set 
of procedures necessary to implement the information security objectives? 
Are the procedures sufficiently clear and understandable to avoid any er­
rors or mistakes when used? Does the scope of the procedures need to be 
extended and the content updated to cover new areas of development and 
change in business operations?
9.3.4  Implementing Improvements to Awareness and Training
Lack of training as mentioned earlier is a common cause of a nonconformity 
and is always an area where there is opportunity for improvement. Does 
the organisation need to improve the competence of some staff involved 
in ISMS-related activities through appropriate education and/or on-the-job 
training and experience? Do staff members need refresher training as rele­
vant to their work? Is the organisation’s awareness and training programme 
sufficiently comprehensive to cover the scope of its ISMS implementation?

10.1  Overview
This chapter explores the world of third-party 
ISMS certification: the basic ideas, which par­
ties are involved and what their roles are, what 
the process involves, who does the audit and 
what qualifications are needed to be an auditor 
and finally the current international trend for 
ISMS certification.
10.2  International Certification 
10.2.1  Global Take Up
ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS certifications are carried 
out in more than 70 countries involving organi­
sations small, medium and large, from a diverse 
range of business sectors. Some examples are 
as follows:

 Telecoms and network services and sup­
pliers; 

 Financial institutions and insurance sector; 

186 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 Manufacturing sector, 

 Utilities (electricity, gas and water); 

 IT vendors, suppliers and services; 

 Government departments and agencies; 

 Retail sector; 

 Entertainment industry; 

 Research and development; 

 Professions (e.g., legal profession); 

 Academic sector.  
The current growth trend is Asia, followed by Europe, then the Ameri­
cas and finally Africa and the Middle East. The current breakdown (at the 
time of this writing) is as follows: 

 Asia (including Australia and New Zealand): 47%; 

 Europe: 29%; 

 Americas: 15%; 

 Africa and the Middle East: 9%.
Even though this percentage looks asymmetric, the growth rate in all 
areas of the world is continually increasing, and predictions from the mar­
ket are that the near future will present a more balanced global spread. 
10.2.2  Motivation  
This diversity not only demonstrates the importance of information secu­
rity in every business sector, but also the wide applicability of the ISO/IEC 
27000 series of standards to meet the demands of business for a “common 
language” for addressing information security issues. The motivation for go­
ing for a third-party ISMS audit is also varied; for example:  

 To comply with legislation and regulations (e.g., data privacy and pro­
tection, governance and computer misuse and hacking); 

 As part of customer and supplier chain contracts (more tenders and 
RFPs are now including ISO 27001 compliance clauses); 

10.2  International Certification  
187

 To demonstrate “fitness for purpose” (see Chapter 2); 

 Insurance reasons (there are instances where insurance premiums 
have been lowered as  organisations can demonstrate they have an ef­
fective risk management system in  place); 

 Market competition (demonstrating ISMS excellence in a particular 
sector). 
10.2.3  Costs and Resources  
The cost to the end user organisation of implementing an ISMS and having 
ISMS certification breaks down into components: the cost of the certifica­
tion bodies (CBs) certification work (initial audit, follow-up surveillance au­
dits and recertification audits) and the cost of internal work (preparing for 
certification, ongoing surveillance audits and maintenance and operational 
costs).  How these costs are calculated varies and is dependent on several 
factors (i.e., the complexity of the ISMS being implemented). In ISO/IEC 
27006 Annex A.1 and A.3, there are some examples of what makes up this 
complexity as well as some guidance on calculating auditor time. With re­
gard to the internal costs, this includes the following: 

 Reviewing risks and taking measurements of ISMS effectiveness;

 Implementing and deploy ISMS controls; 

 Producing documentation;

 Awareness and training;

 Resources for specific security functions (e.g., a security officer/man­
ager, firewall administrator or physical security manager). Of course, 
this might seem an expensive exercise, but it should be realised that 
some of these items should be everyday expenses for a lot of com­
panies since documentation, training and awareness are required in 
other areas of the business. Also, depending on the size and system’s 
complexity, these costs maybe not be large at all. In effect, if security is 
integrated, as it should be, with other parts of the business, then some 
of these costs will be absorbed and shared by other business functions 
and operations. If information security is seen as an important aspect 
of the business, and it is rare to find a company where some aspect of 
information security is not required, then resources will need to be 
part of the business budget regardless of whether the organisation goes 

188 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
for certification. Of course, it is a commercial balance and a tradeoff 
between implementing just the appropriate level of security and going 
over the top with unnecessary expenditure. This is why it is important 
to carry out an information security risk assessment—so that manage­
ment can make the right decisions on where to spend money (see 
ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 6). Hence, we must not lose sight of the fact 
that the business needs to survive in today’s dynamic and competitive 
markets, and the more accurate the analysis of the risks the company 
faces, the better informed management is to make the right decisions 
to do the best for the company and how best to invest in information 
security. 
10.3  Certification and Accreditation
10.3.1  Interested Parties
Accredited ISMS certification involves the following interested parties: ac­
creditation bodies (ABs), certification bodies (CBs) and the end user organi­
sation (whose ISMS is to be certified). Each of these interested parties play 
different roles in the process and has different responsibilities.
10.3.2  Accreditation
Accreditation is a formal process carried out by a national accreditation 
body (AB). The AB is the body that provides formal, third-party recognition 
of the competence of the CB to perform specific certification and auditing 
tasks and deliver certification services to the end user. For the end user 
organisation (CB customer), it provides a means to identify a proven, com­
petent CB so that the selection is an informed choice. It also means the CB 
can demonstrate to its customers that it has been successful at conforming 
to the requirements specified in international accreditation standards for 
management systems.
ISMS certification process uses the same model as other management 
systems, such ISO 9001 for quality management, ISO 14001 for environ­
ment management and ISO 220002 for food safety management.
In assessing the adequacy of the CB to carry out ISMS certifications in 
accordance with ISO 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006, the AB will:

 Carry out CB head office visits to check that the CB has the necessary 
systems processes, and procedures in place and these are functioning 
correctly to undertake such ISMS audits; 

10.4  Standards Involved 
189

 Assess whether the CB has an adequate number of qualified auditors 
to carry out ISMS certifications; 

 Carrying ISMS onsite witnessed audits to assess the competency of the 
auditors working in practice.  
After being accredited, the CB can then offer ISMS certification services 
to their clients. This accreditation lasts for three years, during which their 
competence and performance will be continually monitored and assessed 
by the AB through regular witnessed audits. After the three years, the CB 
can be reaccredited by the AB, extending its certificate of accreditation for 
another three years.  
The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) site (www.iaf.nu) provides 
a list of recognised accreditation bodies, and www.european-accreditation.
org gives a list of the European accreditation bodies. Examples of ABs are 
UKAS in the UK, SWEDAC in Sweden, ANAB in the US, EMA in Mexico, 
TGA in Germany, SCC in Canada and JAB and JIPDEC in Japan. 
A CB that that offers accredited certification services need to be after ac­
credited by an AB. Currently, a large number of CBs can provide accredited 
ISMS certification services.  
10.3.3  Certification  
The CB carries out certification audits on their clients ISMS. In this chapter, 
clause 11.5 describes the audit process, which is a two-stage process.  
The CB issues certificates to it clients based on a successful audit being 
carried out. This certificate lasts for three years. During this three-year pe­
riod, the CB will carry out regular surveillance audits, every 6 to 12 months. 
At the end of the three years, the certificate expires. If the client wishes to 
continue to have a valid certification, then before the expiry date the client 
needs to apply to the CB for a recertification audit. The client will be reis­
sued with a certificate following a successful recertification audit.
10.4  Standards Involved
The main standards involved in the accreditation and certification process 
are outlines in the following sections.
10.4.1  Accreditation
The following are the current standards used by the AB to assess and ac­
credit the CB:

190 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard

 ISO 17021-1: Conformity Assessment—Requirements for Bodies Pro­
viding Audit and Certification of Management Systems; 

 ISO/IEC 27006: International Accreditation Guidelines for the Accred­
itation of Bodies Operating Certification/Registration of Information 
Security Management Systems; 

 ISO 19011: Guidelines for Auditing Management Systems. 
10.4.2  Certification  
The following are the current standards used by the CB to audit and certify 
the customer’s ISMS: 

 ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management Systems—Require­
ments; 

 ISO 19011: Guidelines for Auditing Management Systems; 

 ISO/IEC 27007: Guidelines for Information Security Management 
Systems Auditing; 

 ISO/IEC 27008: Guidelines for Auditors on ISMS Controls.  
10.4.3  End-User Organisations (ISMS Owners)
Organisations of course may use all the other standards in the ISO/IEC 
27000 ISMS series as supporting guidance and advice on the implementa­
tion of ISO/IEC 27001. This includes ISO/IEC 27002—Code of Practice for 
Information Security Controls; ISO/IEC 27003—Information Security Man­
agement System—Guidance; ISO/IEC 27004—Information Security Man­
agement—Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation; 27005—
Information Security Risk Management.  In addition, those organisations 
working in certain business sectors, such as telecom or energy, may decide 
to use the relevant sector-specific standard for additional controls, and im­
plementation advice—for example, ITU X.1051 | ISO/IEC 27011 (telecoms), 
ISO/IEC 27013 (service management and ISMS), ISO/IEC 27015 (finance 
sector), ISO/IEC 27017 and 27018 (cloud services) and ISO/IEC 27019 (en­
ergy sector). However, it needs to be emphasised that conformance (in ISO 
terms) is to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 and all other standards are 
not mandatory.

10.5  ISMS Audits 
191
10.5  ISMS Audits
10.5.1  Certification Scope
The scope of the ISMS (as detailed in ISO/IEC 27001, Chapter 4.3) is de­
fined by the organisation. The organisation that wants its ISMS certified 
also needs to define the scope of certification (the ISMS scope should not be 
confused with the scope of certification that encompasses the ISMS scope 
and any excluded ISO/IEC 27001 requirements). It is the role of the CB 
to check that this scope is consistent with its business and that it does not 
exclude anything of their operation, which could affect the organisation’s 
capability, and/or responsibility, to provide information security that meets 
the security requirements determined by risk assessment and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
The CB should ensure that the organisation’s information security risk 
assessment properly reflects its activities and extends to the boundaries of 
its ISMS activities, taking account of any interfaces and dependencies as 
defined in ISO/IEC 27001 (Chapter 4.3), and it should confirm that this is 
reflected in the organisation’s Statement of Applicability (SoA); see ISO/
IEC 27001 Chapter 6.1.3.d. If the ISMS interfaces with services or activities 
that are not completely within its scope of certification, the risks associated 
with these interfaces should nevertheless be included in the organisation’s 
information security risk assessment.
10.5.2  Audit Process
The certification of an organisation’s information security management sys­
tem (ISMS) against the standard ISO/IEC 27001 is a two-stage audit process 
as detailed in ISO/IEC 27006.
10.5.2.1  Audit Stage 1
During this stage, the CB carries out a review of the organisation’s ISMS 
scope of certification and its documentation. This will include consideration 
of the definition of the ISMS scope and its ISMS policy, the risk assessment 
report and risk treatment plan, the Statement of Applicability, and other 
core elements of ISMS. This review enables the auditors to get an under­
standing and appreciation of the organisation’s ISMS. This then will provide 
a focus for planning the subsequent parts of the audit. It gives an indica­
tion of the state of preparedness of the organisation for the audit. Once this 
review is complete and an audit report is produced, the CB is in a position 
to decide whether to proceed with stage 2 of the audit. Before proceeding 
to the next stage, the CB needs to bring together an audit team with the 

192 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
necessary competence to address the auditing of the organisation’s ISMS 
scope of certification.
10.5.2.2  Audit Stage 2
During this stage, the CB audit team visits the site(s) of the organisation to 
carry out an audit of the ISMS. The objective of this stage is to confirm that 
the organisation is in comformance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 
standard and that it adheres to its own policies and business objectives.
The audit team should clearly focus on the main areas of the standard’s 
mandatory requirements, including:

 The ISMS in the organisational context (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 4); 

 Commitment, leadership and support of the organisation’s top man­
agement (ISO/IEC  27001 Clauses 5 and 7); 

 The risk assessment and risk treatment processes (ISO/IEC 27001 
Clause 6); 

 The resulting ISMS design and implementation (ISO/IEC 27001 
Clause 8); 

 The performance evaluation process (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 9) and 
the continual  improvement (ISO/IEC 27001 Clause 10).  The audit 
team also needs to consider specifics (e.g., what the organisation has 
put in place for monitoring and measuring ISMS performance and 
effectiveness, as well as reporting and reviewing against its business 
objectives and targets). 
The assessment will include checking: 

 What has been planned and implemented is in operational use to en­
sure that security;

 That management reviews take place; 

 That there is an internal ISMS audit process in place; 

 What management responsibility has been defined for implementation 
and  deployment of its information security policy. 
The audit team also needs to consider specifics regarding the risk man­
agement process: the risk assessment methods used, the risk criteria, the 
process of determining controls, the SoA and the justification statements in 
the SoA.

10.5  ISMS Audits 
193
An important aspect of the audit is the presentation and examination 
of objective evidence to demonstrate the audit trail links between the in­
formation security policy, the results of the risk assessments, security objec­
tives and targets, the responsibilities for information security, the system of 
controls and procedures and what has been put in place for performance 
monitoring and security reviews.
10.5.3  Nonconformities
In the case of ISO/IEC 27001 a nonconformity is the absence of, or the fail­
ure to implement and maintain, one or more requirements that the stan­
dards define for an ISMS or a situation that would on the basis of objective 
evidence raise significant doubt as to the capability of the ISMS to achieve 
the security policy and objectives of the organisation.
The CB can define grades of deficiency and areas for improvement (e.g., 
major or minor nonconformities and observations). If such grades of de­
ficiency are used, however they may be defined by the CB, all types of 
nonconformity should be dealt with as specified in ISO 17021-1 and ISO/
IEC 27006.
10.5.4  Audit Report
The audit team is required to provide to the CB management a report of 
its findings and recommendations as to the conformity of the organisa­
tion’s ISMS with all of the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. 
Any nonconformity needs to be discharged in order to comply with all of 
the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001. These nonconformities should be 
promptly brought to the organisation’s attention and an action plan agreed 
to resolve them.
The CB shall ask the organisation to comment on the report and to de­
scribe the specific corrective actions it will take, or plans it will take within 
a defined time, to remedy any nonconformity. The closure of such followup 
actions may need a full or partial reassessment of the ISMS, or a written dec­
laration to be confirmed during surveillance may be considered adequate.
This report should include the identification of ISMS elements audited, 
the assessed scope of the ISMS being audited, comments on the conformity 
of the organisation’s ISMS with the requirements of the standard with a 
clear statement of any nonconformity and, where applicable, any useful 
comparison with the results of previous assessments of the organisation.
The decision whether or not to award a certificate in regard to an or­
ganisation’s ISMS shall be made by the CB on the basis of the informa­
tion gathered during the audit, the audit report and any other relevant 

194 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
information. Those who review the report and make the decision to certify 
shall not have been those that have participated in the ISMS audit to ensure 
impartiality of the process.
The certificate awarded to the organisation carries the logo of the CB as 
well as the logo of the accreditation body that has accredited the CB.
10.5.5  Surveillance Audits
The CB will carry out periodic surveillance audits at sufficiently close inter­
vals to verify that the organisation’s certified ISMS continues to conform 
with the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, and the ISMS re­
mains effective with regard to achieving the objectives of the organisation’s 
information security policy. This audit should also examine the action taken 
by the organisation on nonconformities identified during the last audit.
If nonconformities are found during surveillance audits, then these shall 
be effectively corrected within a time agreed by the CB and to the satisfac­
tion of the CB in accordance to accreditation requirements. If correction of 
any nonconformity is not made within this agreed time, then the certifica­
tion shall be suspended or even withdrawn. The time given to carry out cor­
rective action should be consistent with the severity of the nonconformity.
According to the ISMS standard ISO/IEC 27001, the organisation needs 
to conduct internal ISMS audits at planned intervals to determine whether 
the ISMS system of controls, processes and procedures conforms to the re­
quirements of the standard. At the same time, the audit should take account 
of the relevant legislation or regulations requirements and that the ISMS 
has been effectively implemented, is effectively maintained and performs as 
expected. An audit programme shall be planned taking into consideration 
the status and importance of the ISMS processes and areas to be audited, as 
well as the results of previous audits.
10.5.6  Recertification
Recertification is normally carried out every three years, and its purpose is 
to verify the overall continuing conformity of the organisation’s ISMS to the 
requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard and that the ISMS has been 
properly implemented and maintained.
Recertification and surveillance audit programmes should normally in­
clude the following:

 Verification that the approved ISMS continues to be implemented.

 Consideration of the implications of changes to the ISMS system of 
controls initiated as a result of changes in the organisation’s operation 

10.5  ISMS Audits 
195
and ensuring the overall effectiveness of the ISMS in its entirety in 
the light of changes in operations. This  includes changes to the ISMS 
documented system.

 Confirmation of continued conformance with the requirements of 
ISO/IEC 27001 and a  demonstration of the commitment to maintain 
the effectiveness of the ISMS and the  effective interaction between all 
elements of the ISMS.

 Aspects of system maintenance, which are the internal ISMS audit, 
internal security  review, management review, and preventive and 
corrective action.  
The ISMS processes, as specified in the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, pro­
vide a management framework for an organisation to realise a programme 
of continual improvement. This should provide the organisation with ef­
fective ISMS implementation and deployment for the common good and 
governance of its business and which also matches the aims of the recertifi­
cation and surveillance audit activities mentioned earlier.  
10.5.7  Audit Trails  
An important aspect of a certification audit is the collection of objective evi­
dence. In gathering such evidence, an auditor commonly looks for a sample 
of audit trails. For example, the organisation should have carried out a risk 
assessment, risk treatment and selection of controls exercises leading to a 
SoA. The auditor should be able to back track this process to find evidence 
that the organisation has carried out the process correctly. For example: 

 The SoA shows a specific control set has been selected for the imple­
mentation question, what was the decision making that went behind 
this selection?

 Tracing backwards, the auditor might then want to discuss this deci­
sion-making process in relation to the risk treatment options selected; 

 Tracing back further, the auditor might then ask, what risks were 
identified in the risk report that led to the risk treatment option of 
reducing the risks? 

 Tracing back, the auditor might want to look at the risk assessment 
report and discuss the control set that has been selected commensu­
rate with the assets, threats and vulnerability they relate to and the 
associated risks that have been identified.  

196 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
The auditor will want to check by gathering answers and evidence that 
there is a correspondence from the controls in the SoA back to the risk as­
sessment that has been carried out.  Other examples include checking on 
the incident handling process that is in place from: 

 Detection, reporting and recording the incident; 

 To the analysis of the incident; 

 To the corrective actions taken to resolve and recover from the inci­
dent; 

 To the closure of the incident action; 

 To followup actions and activities to ensure preventative measures are 
deployed to  avoid reoccurrence of the incident.  
Again, the auditor could build up an audit trail of objective evidence 
that the correct procedures and deployment of information security con­
trols are in place to manage the risks of incident past, present and future. 
There are many examples in the implementation and deployment of the 
controls from ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A (i.e., the control statements from 
ISO/IEC 27002). These might include establishing audit trails relating to: 

 Access control measures and procedures; 

 Backups; 

 Business continuity plans and testing; 

 Email and Internet policies; 

 Legal and regulatory controls; 

 Third-party contracts, SLAs and service delivery management; 

 Physical security measures.
Like the two examples given earlier, the auditor should be looking to 
build up audit trails of objective evidence that the correct procedures and 
deployment of controls are in place to manage the risks of the business. The 
auditor will also be looking at the ongoing management of these processes 
and controls looking for indications and evidence that the organisation is 
monitoring and reviewing its systems to check how effective its security is 
and what measures are planned to improve in areas where the security is 
not so effective. 

10.5  ISMS Audits 
197
10.5.8  Competence  
Confidence and reliance in the certification audit process is dependent on 
several things, in particular, the general competence of personnel involved 
in each of the certification functions and the more specific competence of 
the auditors conducting ISMS audits. The certification functions include 
conducting client application reviews, auditing, lead auditor, reviewing au­
dit reports and making certification decisions. 
The accreditation requires that the CB has a process in place that defines 
the necessary competence requirements of its personnel in the certification 
functions. This includes technological, legal and regulatory knowledge rel­
evant to the client’s ISMS being audited.
The CB shall also have a process and criteria in place for verifying the 
competence of personnel—their experience, training and knowledge. Gen­
eral and specific experience, knowledge and training related to ISMS certi­
fications include the following:

 Management systems and auditing;

 Principles of auditing and the audit process (ISO 19011 and ISO/IEC 
27007); 

 Management systems principles, philosophy, processes that is ISMS 
specific;

 General knowledge of information security; 

 ISMS standard ISO/IEC 27001; 

 Specific processes such as risk assessment and risk treatment (e.g., 
knowledge  of principles and methods defined in ISO/IEC 27005); 

 ISMS monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation (e.g., knowl­
edge of  principles and methods defined in ISO/IEC 27004); 

 Information security controls relevant to implementing the ISMS 
standard ISO/IEC 27001 (e.g., ISO/IEC 27002): 

 Policies and procedures;

 Human resource security;

 Access control methods;

 Operation security;

 Communications security;

 Physical and environmental security. 

 Technical knowledge of the activity to be audited.

198 
Implementing the ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS Standard
The CB needs to have the competence at selecting auditors with the nec­
essary knowledge, skill and experience to ensure that the audits are carried 
out effectively and uniformly. The general criteria for auditor competence is 
based on a demonstration of the ability to apply a range of knowledge and 
skills gained from formal education, IT and ISMS work experience, ISMS 
auditor training and auditing experience.
Auditors are expected to develop, maintain and improve their compe­
tence through a programme of continual professional development and by 
participating regularly in ISMS audits.
The International Register of Certificates Auditors has defined a set of 
criteria for auditor certification based on ISO 19011 (general auditor com­
petence) and ISO/IEC 27006 (ISMS-specific competence). This covers the 
minimum requirements that auditors need to satisfy in terms of formal edu­
cation, work experience, auditor training, and auditing experience to be 
certified as either an ISMS auditor or ISMS lead auditor (see www.irca.
org). Also,� IRCA has defined the criteria for ISMS training courses based 
on the ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards. Training organisations can ap­
ply to IRCA to have their courses approved according to the criteria. ISO is 
developing a standard on competence requirements for ISMS professionals 
(ISO/IEC 27021). This standard is not expected to be published until 2017 
at the earliest.

11.1  The ISMS—A Living System
The ISMS should not be treated as a static sys­
tem. It needs to be treated as a living, dynamic 
system that will change. If the ISMS is treated 
as a static system, then after a period of time it 
will surely become ineffective at protecting the 
organisation’s information assets, it will provide 
an inadequate quality of protection, and it will 
be unsuitable to meet the requirements, needs, 
purpose and objectives of the organisation and 
interested parties. Such an ISMS will devalue 
the organisation’s investment in the design, de­
velopment and implementation of its ISMS.  
The only way the ISMS can maintain the 
three objective measures of effectiveness, ade­
quacy and suitability is if the ISMS is treated as 
a living, dynamic and continual improvement 
system.  
This means that there are a number of criti­
cal processes and life cycles that need to con­
tinually used, reviewed and refreshed. Most 
of these have been discussed in the preceding 
chapters. As a conclusion to this book, we shall 
present again some (but not all) of these pro­
cesses in diagram form.

continual improvement to the deliver the intended outcomes against the 
requirements of ISO/IEC 27001, then the ISMS has value as a business en­
abler helping the organisation to move forward knowing that its informa­
tion is effectively, adequately and suitably protected.

He is the convenor of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 responsible for the de­
velopment and maintenance of the family of ISO/IEC 27001 ISMS stan­
dards. He is often quoted as “the father of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 
27002” for his original and pioneering work on the early UK versions of 
these standards, as well as his seminal work and leadership in the progres­
sion of these UK standards into world-best-selling ISO standards. His is also 
recognised for his work in championing the development and promotion 
of ISO/IEC 27001 certification around the world. During this formative 
time, he has been at the forefront in building the international certification 
framework—from the development of the original accreditation require­
ments documents for ISMS CBs, through the support of organisations and 
the development of CBs, acting as a lead assessor and senior advisor for 
several national accreditation bodies, developing the original ISMS com­
petence requirements for auditors and providing professional training on 
certification for end users, CB auditors and AB assessors. In addition, he is 
a leading authority on applied information security risk and incident man­
agement, and cyber resilience, in particular, related to the challenges of
