Akira Ishimaru was born in Fukuoka, Japan. He became a naturalized US citizen in
1963. He received the B.S. degree from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1951
and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington,
Seattle, in 1958. He is a registered engineer in the state of Washington.
From 1951 to 1952, he was with the Electrotechnical Laboratory, Tanashi, Tokyo,
and in 1956, he was with Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ. In 1958, he joined the fac-
ulty of the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, where
he was a Professor of electrical engineering, and an Adjunct Professor of applied
mathematics. He is currently Professor Emeritus there. He has also been a Visiting
Associate Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. His current research
includes waves in random media, remote sensing, object detection, and imaging in
clutter environment, inverse problems, millimeter wave, optical propagation and scat-
tering in the atmosphere and the terrain, rough surface scattering, and optical diffusion

PREFACE
The original edition of this book, Electromagnetic Wave Propagation, Radiation, and
Scattering, was published by Prentice Hall in 1991. When IEEE Press/AP-S Liaison
Committee expressed interest in updating the original edition by including additional
chapters on new topics that reflect changing interests in the field since the original
publication, I was delighted and excited by the opportunity to include some new
materials and ideas about the state of electromagnetics.
Electromagnetics is fundamental to all aspects of electrical engineering and in fact
most of engineering and science. Electromagnetics theory describes and expresses
all electromagnetic fields in space and time, as well as in vector formulations, using
both real and complex mathematical and analytical methods.
Analytical and computational electromagnetics are two aspects of the fundamental
work of pursuing unique and novel ideas in the field, with the same purpose and
objectives. This book is focused on an analytical approach, and emphasizes new
ideas and applications. The important topic of computational electromagnetics is not
included in this book; there are many excellent texts on the subject for the interested
reader, such as Computational Methods for Electromagnetics by Peterson, Ray, and
Mittra (Wiley-IEEE Press, 1998).
The newly revised material in this edition is focused on the following topics:
1. Statistical wave theories; these theories have been extensively applied to top-
ics such as geophysical remote sensing, bioelectromagnetics, bio-optics, and
bioultrasound imaging;
2. Integration of several distinct yet related disciplines such as statistical wave
theories, communications, signal processing, and time-reversal imaging;

PREFACE
3. New phenomena of multiple scattering, such as coherent scattering and memory
effects;
4. Multiphysics applications that combine theories for different physical phenom-
ena such as seismic coda waves (which are acoustic waves in elastic solid earth),
stochastic wave theory, heat diffusion, and temperature rise in biological and
other media; and
5. Metamaterials and solitons in optical fibers, nonlinear phenomena, and porous
media.
Chapters 1 to 17 of this revised book are from the original edition, and emphasize
the fundamentals of electromagnetic wave propagation. The new chapters 18 to 26
are largely focused on new topics in electromagnetics. The new chapters describe the
following topics:
Chapter 18 presents an overview of the stochastic Sommerfeld problem, stochastic
Green’s function, channel capacity in random media, and related topics.
Chapter 19 covers geophysical applications, including polarimetric radars, space–
time vector radiative transfer, the Wigner distribution, and the Stokes vector. Bioelec-
tromagnetics, heat diffusion in tissues, optical diffusion and ultrasonic scattering in
tissues, and OCT (optical coherence tomography) and low coherence interferometry
are included in Chapter 20.
Chapter 21 presents fundamentals of metamaterials, including wave packets in
a dispersive negative index medium, backward lateral and surface waves, negative
Goos–Hanchen shift, perfect lens, evanescent waves, electromagnetic Brewster’s
angle, acoustic Brewster’s angle, and transformation electromagnetics.
Chapter 22 describes “time-reversal” imaging, including the relation to SVD
(singular value decomposition), MUSIC (multiple signal classification) imaging, and
DORT (decomposition of time-reversal operator).
Scattering in random media is not normally discussed in electromagnetic texts.
However, there is extensive literature on the subject, including my IEEE Press book
Wave Propagation and Scattering in Random Media (1997). This topic is summarized
in Chapter 23, with an emphasis on angular spectrum, pulse propagation, coherence
time and bandwidth, and spectral broadening.
Multiple scattering theories in random media are fundamental not only in
electrical engineering but in astrophysics and condensed matter physics. Chapter 24
gives a sketch of this important and difficult problem, and formulations of the Dyson
and Bethe–Salpeter equations and Feynman diagram. Included are recent studies of
backscattering enhancement, Anderson localization, super resolution, and memory
effects.
The interesting history of the discovery of solitons and the KdV equation are
discussed in Chapter 25, with special emphasis on optical fibers.
The mixing formula was originally discussed in Chapter 8 and used to find the
permittivity of the mixture. The same material can alternatively be viewed as a “porous
medium,” where the medium contains “pores.” The porous medium approach can be
used to find the mixture’s permittivity and the flow rate of fluid through the pores

(fluid permeability). This is a situation encountered in oil shale, and a discussion of
that application is included in Chapter 26.
Chapter 26 also discusses the topic of seismic waves. A seismic wave is an acous-
tic wave in the earth, which is considered as an elastic solid. The initial part of the
wave pulse is important and is used to determine the seismic wave (earthquake)
magnitude. However, the subsequent wave train due to multiple scattering can reveal
useful additional information about the total seismic energy and the medium’s char-
acteristics. This wave train, called the “seismic coda,” is discussed in Chapter 26.
This chapter also includes a discussion of P-waves (pressure), S-waves (shear), and
Rayleigh surface waves, all of which are important for seismic study.
The revised book is intended as a textbook for graduate courses in electrical
engineering. It should also be of interest to graduate students in bioengineering,
geophysics, ocean engineering, and geophysical remote sensing. The book is also a
useful reference for engineers and scientists working in fields such as geophysical
remote sensing, biomedical engineering in optics and ultrasound, and new materials
and integration with signal processing. Please note that the solutions manual for the
problems in Chapters 1 through 17 is available to anyone who requests it. To obtain
the manual, please email your request to ieeeproposals@wiley.com.
I am grateful to IEEE Press, in particular Bob Mailloux, Gary Brown, and Ross
Stone, and to Mary Hatcher at Wiley, for their help and encouragement. John Ishimaru
has been of enormous help in preparing the manuscript. I thank my colleagues, in
particular Yasuo Kuga, Leung Tsang, and Radha Poovendran, and graduate students,
including T.-H. Liao and many others. Some of the work described in this book was
supported by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
Numerous new advances have been made in electromagnetic theory in recent years.
This is due, in part, to new applications of the theory to many practical problems. For
example, in microwave and millimeter wave applications, there is an increasing need
to investigate the electromagnetic problems of new guiding structures, phased arrays,
microwave imaging, polarimetric radars, microwave hazards, frequency-sensitive
surfaces, composite materials, and microwave remote sensing. In the field of optics,
applications involving fiber optics, integrated optics, atmospheric optics, light diffu-
sion in tissues, and optical oceanography are among many problems whose solutions
require the use of electromagnetic theory as an essential element. The mathemati-
cal techniques used in electromagnetic theory are also equally applicable to ocean
acoustics, acoustic scattering in the atmosphere, and ultrasound imaging of tissues. In
this book, we attempt to present a cohesive account of these advances with sufficient
background material.
This book has three overall objectives. First, we present the fundamental concepts
and formulations in electromagnetic theory. Second, advanced mathematical tech-
niques and formulations such as the saddlepoint technique, integral equations, GTD,
and the T-matrix method are presented. Third, new topics, such as inverse scattering,
diffraction tomography, vector radiative transfer, and polarimetry, are discussed.
The book includes several topics that are often not adequately covered in many
electromagnetics texts. Examples are the Maxwell–Garnett and Polder–van Santen
mixing formulas for the effective dielectric constant of mixtures and waves in chiral
media. Also included are London’s equations and the two-fluid model of the complex
conductivity of superconductors at high frequencies. Other examples are Radon
transform, diffraction tomography, holographic and physical optics inverse problems,
Abel’s inversion formula, and polarimetry.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
The book also includes more conventional but important topics such as the spec-
tral method, strip lines, patches, apertures, Stokes vectors, modified saddlepoint
techniques, Watson transforms, residue series, T-matrix, GTD, and UTD. Also cov-
ered are Zenneck waves, plasmons, Goos–Hanchen effects, construction of Green’s
functions, Green’s dyadic, radiometry, and noise temperatures. An important cur-
rent topic that is not included due to space limitations is that of wave propagation
and scattering in random media. However, this has been covered adequately in the
author’s previous book (Academic Press, 1978). Other topics that have been omitted
are nonlinear electromagnetics, solitons, and chaos.
This book is based on a set of lecture notes prepared for a three-quarter graduate
course on electromagnetic waves and applications given in the Department of Electri-
cal Engineering at the University of Washington. The course has been offered yearly
for students primarily from within the department of electrical engineering, but also
including those from bioengineering, atmospheric sciences, geophysics, and oceanog-
raphy. The course is also offered via cable television to students in remote sites located
at nearby aerospace and bioengineering companies. The interest of the students vary
considerably, from microwave antennas, radomes, and radar cross sections, to ultra-
sound imaging, optical scattering, ocean acoustics applications, microwave hazards,
and bioelectromagnetics. This book is therefore intended to concentrate on funda-
mentals as well as recent analytical techniques, so that students may be prepared to
handle a variety of old and new applications.
It is assumed that readers are familiar with material normally covered in undergrad-
uate courses on electromagnetic theory, differential equations, Fourier and Laplace
transforms, vector analysis, and linear algebra. However, brief reviews of these topics
are given whenever needed. The time convention used in this book is exp( jωt). For
some topics such as Stokes parameters, which are used extensively by the optics and
acoustics community, the convention of exp(–iωt) is used and its use is clearly noted.
This book is intended as a textbook for a first-year graduate course, and the mate-
rial can be covered in two semesters or three-quarters with appropriate selections
depending on the students’ interests. The book is also a useful reference for engi-
neers working on electromagnetic, optical, or acoustics problems with aerospace,
bioengineering, remote sensing, and ocean engineering applications.
I am grateful to Noel Henry for her expert typing and her assistance in organizing
the manuscript. I also thank my graduate students and colleagues who have made
many valuable comments. Some of the work in this book was supported by the
National Science Foundation, the US Army Research Office, the Office of Naval
Research, and the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station. I also wish
to thank Elizabeth Kaster, Editor, Prentice Hall, for her encouragement and editorial
assistance.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Many advances in electromagnetic theory were made in recent years in response to
new applications of the theory to microwaves, millimeter waves, optics, and acoustics;
as a result, there is a need to present a cohesive account of these advances with
sufficient background material. In this book we present the fundamentals and the
basic formulations of electromagnetic theory as well as advanced analytical theory
and mathematical techniques and current new topics and applications.
In Chapter 2, we review the fundamentals, starting with Maxwell’s equations and
covering such fundamental concepts and relationships as energy relations, potentials,
Hertz vectors, and uniqueness and reciprocity theorems. The chapter concludes with
linear acoustic-wave formulation. Plane-wave incidence on dielectric layers and wave
propagation along layered media are often encountered in practice. Examples are
microwaves in dielectric coatings, integrated optics, waves in the atmosphere, and
acoustic waves in the ocean. Chapter 3 deals with these problems, starting with
reviews of plane waves incident on layered media, Fresnel formulas, Brewster’s
angle, and total reflection. The concepts of complex waves, trapped surface waves, and
leaky waves are presented with examples of surface-wave propagation along dielectric
slabs, and this is followed by discussion on the relation between Zenneck waves and
plasmons. The chapter concludes with Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouim (WKB) solutions
and the Bremmer series for inhomogeneous media and turning points, and WKB
solutions for the propagation constant of guided waves in inhomogeneous media
such as graded-index fibers.

INTRODUCTION
Chapter 4 deals with microwave waveguides, dielectric waveguides, and cavities.
Formulations for transverse magetic (TM), transverse electric (TE), and transverse
electromagnetic (TEM) waves, eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, and the k–β diagram are
given, followed by pulse propagation in dispersive media. Dielectric waveguides,
step-index fibers, and graded-index fibers are discussed next with due attention to
dispersion. It concludes with radial and azimuthal waveguides, rectangular and cylin-
drical cavities, and spherical waveguides and cavities. This chapter introduces Green’s
identities, Green’s theorem, special functions, Bessel and Legendre functions, eigen-
functions and eigenvalues, and orthogonality.
One of the most important and useful tools in electromagnetic theory is Green’s
functions. They are used extensively in the formulation of integral equations and
radiation from various sources. Methods of constructing Green’s functions are dis-
cussed in Chapter 5. First, the excitation of waves by electric and magnetic dipoles
is reviewed. Three methods of expressing Green’s functions are discussed. The first
is the representation of Green’s functions in a series of eigenfunctions. The second
is to express them using the solutions of homogeneous equations. Here, we discuss
the important properties of Wronskians. The third is the Fourier transform repre-
sentation of Green’s functions. In actual problems, these three methods are often
combined to obtain the most convenient representations. Examples are shown for
Green’s functions in rectangular waveguides and cylindrical and spherical structures.
Chapter 6 deals with the radiation field from apertures. We start with Green’s
theorem applied to the field produced by the sources and the fields on a surface.
Here, we discuss the extinction theorem and Huygens’ formula. Next, we consider
the Kirchhoff approximation and Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction formulas. Spec-
tral representations of the field are used to obtain Gaussian beam waves and the
radiation from finite apertures. The interesting phenomenon of the Goos–Hanchen
shift of a beam wave at an interface and higher-order beam waves are also discussed.
The chapter concludes with the electromagnetic vector Green’s theorem, Stratton–
Chu formula, Franz formula, equivalence theorem, and electromagnetic Kirchhoff
approximations.
The periodic structures discussed in Chapter 7 are used in many applications,
such as optical gratings, phased arrays, and frequency-selective surfaces. We start
with the Floquet-mode representation of waves in periodic structures. Guided waves
along periodic structures and plane-wave incidence on periodic structures are dis-
cussed using integral equations and Green’s function. An interesting question regard-
ing the Rayleigh hypothesis for scattering from sinusoidal surfaces is discussed.
Also included are the coupled-mode theory and co-directional and contra-directional
couplers.
Chapter 8 deals with material characteristics. We start with the dispersive char-
acteristics of dielectric material, the Sellmeier equation, plasma, and conductors. It
also includes the Maxwell–Garnett and Polder–van Santen mixing formulas for the
effective dielectric constant of mixtures. Wave propagation characteristics in mag-
netoplasma, which represents the ionosphere and ionized gas, and in ferrite, used in
microwave networks, are discussed as well as Faraday rotation, group velocity, warm
plasma, and reciprocity relations. This is followed by wave propagation in chiral

material. The chapter concludes with London’s equations and the two-fluid model of
superconductors at high frequencies.
Chapter 9 presents selected topics on antennas, apertures, and arrays. Included in
this chapter are radiation from current distributions, dipoles, slots, and loops. Also dis-
cussed are arrays with nonuniform spacings, microstrip antennas, mutual couplings,
and the integral equation for current distributions on wire antennas. Chapter 10 starts
with a general description of the scattering and absorption characteristics of waves by
dielectric and conducting objects. Definitions of cross sections and scattering ampli-
tudes are given, and Rayleigh scattering and Rayleigh–Debye approximations are
discussed. Also included are the Stokes vector, the Mueller matrix, and the Poincar´e
sphere for a description of the complete and partial polarization states. Techniques
discussed for obtaining the cross sections of conducting objects include the physi-
cal optics approximation and the moment method. Formal solutions for cylindrical
structures, spheres, and wedges are presented in Chapter 11, including a discussion of
branch points, the saddle-point technique, the Watson transform, the residue series,
and Mie theory. Also discussed is diffraction by wedges, which will be used in
Chapter 13.
Electromagnetic scattering by complex objects is the topic of Chapter 12. We
present scalar and vector formulations of integral equations. Babinet’s principle for
scalar and electromagnetic fields, electric field integral equation (EFIE), and magnetic
field integral equation (MFIE) are discussed. The T-matrix method, also called the
extended boundary condition method, is discussed and applied to the problem of
sinusoidal surfaces. In addition to the surface integral equation, also included are
the volume integral equation for two- and three-dimensional dielectric bodies and
Green’s dyadic. Discussions of small apertures and slits are also included.
Geometric theory of diffraction (GTD) is one of the powerful techniques for
dealing with high-frequency diffraction problems. GTD and UTD (uniform geo-
metric theory of diffraction) are discussed in Chapter 13. Applications of GTD to
diffraction by slits, knife edges, and wedges are presented, including slope diffraction,
curved wedges, and vertex and surface diffractions.
Chapter 14 deals with excitation and scattering by sources, patches, and apertures
embedded in planar structures. Excitation of a dielectric slab is discussed, followed by
the WKB solution for the excitation of waves in inhomogeneous layers. An example
of the latter is acoustic-wave excitation by a point source in the ocean. Next, we
give general spectral formulations for waves in patches, strip lines, and apertures
embedded in dielectric layers. Convenient equivalent network representations are
presented that are applicable to strip lines and periodic patches and apertures.
The Sommerfeld dipole problem is that of finding the field when a dipole is located
above the conducting earth. This classical problem, which dates back to 1907, when
Zenneck investigated what is now known as the Zenneck wave, is discussed in Chapter
15, including a detailed study of the Sommerfeld pole, the modified saddle-point
technique, lateral waves, layered media, and mode representations.
The inverse scattering problem in Chapter 16 is one of the important topics in recent
years. It deals with the problem of obtaining the properties of an object by using the
observed scattering data. First, we present the Radon transform, used in computed

INTRODUCTION
tomography or X-ray tomography. The inverse Radon transform is obtained by using
the projection slice theorem and the back projection of the filtered projection. Also
included is an alternative inverse Radon transform in terms of the Hilbert transform.
For ultrasound and electromagnetic imaging problems, it is necessary to include
the diffraction effect. This leads to diffraction tomography, which makes use of
back propagation rather than back projection. Also discussed are physical optics
inverse scattering and the holographic inverse problem. Abel’s integral equations are
frequently used in inverse problems. Here, we illustrate this technique by using it to
find the electron density profile in the ionosphere. Polarimetric radars are becoming
increasingly more important because of the advances in polarimetric measurement
techniques. We present the fundamentals of polarimetry and optimization as well as
polarization signatures.
Chapter 17 presents fundamentals of radiometry and noise. The definitions of
antenna temperature, radiative transfer theory, and the scattering cross section of
surfaces are given, followed by consideration of system noise temperature and mini-
mum detectable temperature. Also included is a discussion on the determination of sky
brightness distribution by interferometry used in radio astronomy. Here, we discuss
the Fourier transform and convolution relationships among the aperture distribution,
the radiation pattern, and sky brightness distributions.
Chapters 18 through 26 were added for the second edition of this book. The
contents of those chapters are summarized in the Preface to the Second Edition.
The appendices give many formulas and detailed derivations of equations that are
too lengthy to be included in the text. They should be helpful in understanding the
material in the text.
Useful reference books on electromagnetics at the intermediate undergraduate
level include Ramo et al. (1965), Jordan and Balmain (1968), Wait (1986), Shen and
Kong (1987), and Cheng (1983). Among books at the advanced level are Stratton
(1941), Harrington (1961), Collin (1966), Felsen and Marcuvitz (1973), Schelkunoff
(1965), Balanis (1989), Kong (1981, 1986), Jones (1964, 1979), and Van Bladel
(1964).

CHAPTER 2
FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
The fundamental field equations for electromagnetic fields are Maxwell’s equations.
In this chapter, we review differential and integral forms of these equations and
discuss boundary conditions, energy relations, Poynting’s theorem, the uniqueness
theorem, and the reciprocity theorem. Vector and scalar potentials and Hertz vectors
are discussed, as they give alternative and often simpler formulations of the problem.
Although electromagnetic waves are vector fields, they can sometimes be represented
or approximated by scalar fields. We present formulations for scalar acoustic waves
as examples of scalar fields.
It will be assumed that the reader is familiar with the electromagnetic field theory
normally covered in undergraduate courses, and therefore, this book starts with a
review of the fundamental field equations. A detailed historical development of
electromagnetic theory is given in Elliott (1966) and Born and Wolf (1970).

MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS
The fundamental differential equations governing the behavior of electromagnetic
fields were given by Maxwell in 1865:

FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
∇⋅̄D = ρ,
(2.3)
∇⋅̄B = 0.
(2.4)
Here ̄E is the electric field vector in volts/meter, ̄H the magnetic field vector
in amperes/meter, ̄D the electric displacement vector in coulombs/meter2, ̄B the
magnetic flux density vector in webers/meter2, ̄J the current density vector in
amperes/meter2, and ρ the volume charge density in coulombs/meter3.
The physical meanings of Maxwell’s equations are often easier to understand if
expressed in alternative integral form. The first two equations, (2.1) and (2.2), can be
converted into integral form by employing Stokes’ theorem:
∫a
∇× ̄A ⋅d̄a = ∮
l ̄A ⋅d̄l,
(2.5)
where ̄A is a vector, d̄a is a differential surface element vector with magnitude da
pointed in the normal direction ̂n (d̄a = ̂n da), and d̄l is a differential line element
vector with magnitude dl pointed in the direction ̂l (see Fig. 2.1). The directions of ̂n
and ̂l are chosen so that ̂l is in the direction of the rotation of the right-handed screw
advancing in the direction ̂n.
Using (2.5), (2.1) and (2.2) are expressed as follows:
∫l
̄H ⋅d̄l = ∮a
(
∂̄D
∂t + ̄J
)
⋅d̄a,
(2.6)
∫l
̄E ⋅d̄l = ∮a
∂̄B
∂t ⋅d̄a.
(2.7)
Equation (2.6) represents Amp`ere’s law that the line integral of a magnetic field
around a closed path is equal to the total current, including the displacement current,
∂̄D∕∂t, through the loop. Equation (2.7) represents Faraday’s law of induction that
the line integral of an electric field around a closed path is equal to the negative of
time rate of change of the total magnetic flux through the loop.

Divergencen theorem.
Equations (2.3) and (2.4) can be expressed in integral form by using the divergence
theorem
∫V
∇⋅̄AdV = ∫S
̄A ⋅d̄a,
(2.8)
where S is the closed surface surrounding a volume V and ̂n is pointed outward
(Fig. 2.2). With (2.8), (2.3) and (2.-4) can be written as
∫S
̄D ⋅d̄a = ∫V
ρ dV,
(2.9)
∫S
̄B ⋅d̄a = 0.
(2.10)
Equation (2.9) is Gauss’s law that the total electric flux flowing out of any closed
surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by the surface. Equation (2.10) states
that there is no magnetic charge and that there is no net magnetic flux flowing in or
out of a closed surface. In addition to Maxwell’s equations, the following force law
holds concerning the force on a charge q moving with velocity ̄v through an electric
field ̄E and a magnetic field ̄B:
̄F = q( ̄E + ̄v × ̄B).
(2.11)
The conservation of charge is embodied in the following continuity equation:
∇⋅̄J + ∂ρ
∂t = 0.
(2.12)
The integral form of (2.12) is obtained by employing the divergence theorem:
∫S
̄J ⋅d̄a + ∂
∂t ∫V
ρdV = 0.
(2.13)
This states that the outward flow of the current through a closed surface S must be
accompanied by the decrease per unit time of the total charge inside the volume V.

10
FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
The continuity equation (2.12) can be derived from Maxwell’s equations by taking
the divergence of (2.1) and using (2.3) and the identity
∇⋅∇× ̄A = 0.
(2.14)
Some vector formulas and theorems and the gradient, the divergence, the curl, and
the Laplacian in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems are shown
in Appendix 2.A.
Equations (2.1)–(2.4) exhibit a mathematical similarity. ̄E and ̄H appear on the
left sides of (2.1) and (2.2) under the same operator, and ̄D and ̄B appear similarly
on the right sides. This may appear to suggest that ̄E and ̄H belong to one class and
̄D and ̄B to another. However, (2.11) shows that the force depends on ̄E and ̄B, not ̄E
and ̄H. In fact, physically, ̄E and ̄B are the fundamental fields and ̄D and ̄H are the
derived fields related to ̄E and ̄B through constitutive relations (Section 2.3).
2.2
TIME-HARMONIC CASE
Since the general behavior of a wave as a function of time can always be expressed
as a superposition of waves at different frequencies through a Fourier transform, it is
sufficient to investigate the characteristics of a wave at a single frequency. The wave
at a single frequency is often called a time-harmonic or monochromatic wave and
is most conveniently described by the real part of the phasor field. For example, the
vector field ̄E(̄r, t), a real function of position ̄r and time t, is given by
̄E(̄r, t) = Re[ ̄Eph(̄r)ejωt],
(2.15)
where ̄Eph(̄r) is a phasor field and, in general, complex. Here we use the convention
that ̄Eph is the peak value rather than the rms value, and thus ̄Eph =
√
2 ̄E(rms). The
x component of ̄E(̄r, t) is then given by
Ex(̄r, t) = Re[Ephx(̄r)ejωt]
= Ax(̄r) cos[ωt + ϕx(̄r)],
(2.16)
where Ax and ϕx are the amplitude and phase, respectively, of the x component of the
phasor Ephx = Axexp[jϕx]. In the following, we omit the subscript ph for the phasor
whenever no confusion is expected to arise.
Let us rewrite Maxwell’s equations for the time-harmonic case:
∇× ̄H(̄r) = jω ̄D(̄r) + ̄J(̄r),
(2.17)
∇× ̄E(̄r) = jω ̄B(̄r),
(2.18)
∇⋅̄D(̄r) = ρ(̄r),
(2.19)
∇⋅̄B(̄r) = 0,

with the continuity equation
∇⋅̄J(̄r) + jωρ(̄r) = 0.
(2.21)
Note that exp(jωt) is dropped, as it is common to all terms and that all the field
quantities in (2.17) to (2.21) are phasors. Equation (2.19) can be obtained by taking
the divergence of (2.17) and using (2.21). Equation (2.20) is obtained by taking the
divergence of (2.18). Thus, for the time-harmonic case, (2.17), (2.18), and (2.21) con-
stitute the complete set of differential equations. For the static field, ω = 0, however,
we need (2.18) and (2.19) for electrostatics and (2.17) and (2.20) for magnetostatics.
Once the time-harmonic fields in terms of the phasor [e.g., ̄E(̄r)] are obtained, the
general transient field ̄E(̄r, t) as a function of time can be obtained by the inverse
Fourier transform
̄E(̄r, t) = 1
2π ∫
̄E(̄r)ejωtdω.
(2.22)
Let us next consider the current ̄J and charge ρ. It is often convenient to separate
the current into the source current and the induced current. For example, in a radio
broadcast the current on the transmitting antenna at a radio station is the source
current, but the currents induced in receiver antennas and nearby metallic walls
are considered the induced current. Similarly, we can separate the charges into the
source charge and the induced charge. The current density ̄J and the charge density
ρ in Maxwell’s equations refer to all currents and charges, source and induced. It is
more convenient, however, to express separately the source currents ̄Js and the source
charges ρs in the following manner:
∇× ̄H(̄r) = jω ̄D(̄r) + ̄J(̄r) + ̄Js(̄r),
(2.23)
∇× ̄E(̄r) = −jω ̄B(̄r),
(2.24)
∇⋅̄D(̄r) = ρ + ρs,
(2.25)
∇⋅̄B(̄r) = 0.
(2.26)
In this form, ̄J and ρ are the induced current density and the induced charge density,
respectively, and as will be shown in Section 2.3, ̄J and ρ will be incorporated into
the medium characteristics.

CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONS
Let us consider Maxwell’s equations (2.23)–(2.26) for time-harmonic electromag-
netic fields. The relationships among ̄D, ̄E, ̄B, ̄H, and ̄J depend on the characteristics
of the medium, and they are expressed by the constitutive parameters. In a linear
passive medium, ̄D and ̄B are linearly related to ̄E and ̄H, respectively. Furthermore,
if the constitutive relationships between ̄D and ̄E, and ̄B and ̄H, do not depend on the
direction of ̄E and ̄H, the medium is called isotropic.

12
FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
Let us first consider a lossless medium where ̄J = 0. For a linear, passive, isotropic
medium, we have
̄D = ε ̄E,
(2.27)
̄B = μ ̄H,
(2.28)
where ε is the permittivity or dielectric constant (farads/meter), μ is the permeability
(henries/meter), and both ε and μ are real and scalar. For free space, the dielectric
constant and the permeability are
ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12 ≃10−9
36π F∕m,
μ0 = 4π × 10−7 H∕m.
(2.29)
Note that the light velocity in free space is given by
c =
1
(μ0ε0)1∕2 ≃3 × 108 m∕s.
(2.30)
It is often convenient to use the dimensionless quantities, the relative dielectric
constant εr, and the relative permeability μr.
εr = ε
ε0
and
μr = μ
μ0
.
(2.31)
If ε and μ are constant from point to point, the medium is called homogeneous.
In an anisotropic medium, where the relationship between ̄D and ̄E (or ̄B and ̄H)
depends on the direction of ̄E (or ̄H) and, therefore, ̄D and ̄E are in general not parallel,
the constitutive parameters should be expressed by the tensor dielectric constant ̄̄ε
(or permeability ̄̄μ):
̄D = ̄̄ε ̄E,
(2.32)
̄B = ̄̄μ ̄H.
(2.33)
For example, (2.32) in the Cartesian coordinate system can be expressed in the
following matrix form:

In (2.32) and (2.33), we called ̄̄ε and ̄̄μ the tensor without defining them. In Chapter
8, we present a detailed discussion of anisotropic media as well as chiral media in
which ̄D and ̄B are coupled to both ̄E and ̄H.

CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONS

Let us consider a lossy medium. In a linear lossy medium, the current density ̄J is
proportional to the electric field ̄E, and this relationship is called Ohm’s law:
̄J = σ ̄E,
(2.35)
where σ is the conductivity (siemens/meter) of the medium. For low frequencies up
to the microwave region, the conductivity is often essentially real and independent of
frequency. We can then rewrite one of Maxwell’s equations (2.23) in the following
manner:
∇× ̄H = jωε ̄E + σ ̄E + ̄Js
= jωεc ̄E + ̄Js,
(2.36)
where εc = ε – j(σ/ω) is called the complex dielectric constant. Note that in (2.36),
the conductivity term σ ̄E is absorbed into the dielectric constant as the imaginary
part. The relative complex dielectric constant is then given by
εr = εc
ε0
= ε
ε0
−j σ
ωε0
= ε′ −jε′′.
(2.37)
The ratio ε′′/ε′ is called the loss tangent,
tan δ = ε′′
ε′ ,
(2.38)
and the complex index of refraction n is given by
n = (εr)1∕2 = n′ −jn′′.
(2.39)
For most materials, the permeability μ is equal to that of free space (μ = μ0).
However, in magnetic material, μ is different from μ0 and may be lossy. This will be
discussed in more detail later when we discuss ferrite materials. We note here that
in general the relative permeability μr = μ/μ0 can be complex (μr = μ′ – jμ′′). The
complex refractive index n is then given by n = (εr μr)1/2. Some examples of the
relative dielectric constant ε′ and the conductivity σ are shown in Table 2.1. Note that
using the relative dielectric constant εr in (2.37), the displacement vector ̄D is now
given by
̄D = εc ̄E.
In the frequency ranges above the microwave region, ε and σ in (2.37) are no longer
independent of frequency and it is often more convenient simply to use the relative
complex dielectric constant εc and not separate it into ε and σ. Therefore, whenever

no confusion is expected to arise, we use ε to indicate the complex dielectric constant.
Maxwell’s equations can then be written as
∇× ̄E = −jωμ ̄H,
(2.40)
∇× ̄H = −jωε ̄E + ̄Js,
(2.41)
∇⋅̄D = ρs,
(2.42)
∇⋅̄B = 0,
(2.43)
where ̄Js and ̄ρs are the source current and charge density, respectively, and ε and μ
are, in general, complex and dependent on frequency. The medium is called dispersive
if ε or μ is dependent on frequency.
In (2.40) to (2.43), the constitutive equations should be written with the complex
ε and μ:
̄D = ε ̄E,
̄B = μ ̄H.
(2.44)
Equations (2.40)–(2.44) constitute a complete description of the fundamental field
equations for a lossy medium. Note that the medium is now expressed in terms of
the complex dielectric constant and the complex permeability. Alternatively, we can
express the medium in terms of the real dielectric constant and the conductivity.
Instead of the dielectric constant and the permeability, we can use two vectors, the
electric polarization ̄P and the magnetic polarization ̄M defined by
̄D = ε0 ̄E + ̄P,
̄B = μ0( ̄H + ̄M).
(2.45)
The vectors ̄P and ̄M represent the electric and magnetic dipole distributions in the
medium and vanish in free space. In a linear medium, they are related to ̄E and ̄H by
the electric and magnetic susceptibilities, χe and χm:
̄P = χeε0 ̄E,
̄M = χm ̄H.
(2.46)

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

The dielectric constant ε in (2.44) is defined for a time-harmonic electromagnetic
phasor field at a certain frequency ω. If the dielectric constant is independent of
frequency, the relationship (2.44) in time is simply given by
̄D(̄r, t) = ε ̄E(̄r, t).
(2.47)
However, if the dielectric constant is a function of frequency, the temporal relationship
is a Fourier transform of the product of ε(ω) and ̄E(ω) and, therefore, is given by the
following convolution integral:
̄D(̄r, t) = ∫
t
−∞
h(t −t′) ̄E(̄r, t′)dt′,
(2.48)
where
h(t) = 1
2π ∫ε(ω)ejωtdω,
(2.49)
̄E(̄r, t) = 1
2π ∫
̄E(̄r, ω)ejωtdω.
(2.50)
The medium whose dielectric constant is a function of frequency ε(ω) is called
dispersive. Although strictly speaking, all media are dispersive, a medium can often
be treated as nondispersive within a frequency range used for a particular problem.
If the medium is linear but time varying, the relationship between ̄D and ̄E cannot
be expressed as the convolution integral (2.48). The general relationship should then
be given by
̄D = (̄r, t) = ∫
t
−∞
h(t, t −t′) ̄E(̄r, t′)dt′.
(2.51)
Substituting (2.50) into (2.51), we get
̄D(̄r, t) = 1
2π ∫ε(t, ω) ̄E(̄r, ω)ejωt dω,
(2.52)
where ε(t,ω) is the time-varying dielectric constant given by
ε(t, ω) = ∫

We will, however, not discuss time-varying media in this book.

tions. Consider an interface between two media with complex dielectric constants

ε1 and ε2. In the absence of the source current ̄Js, we write (2.41) in integral
form,
∫l
̄H ⋅d̄l = ∫a
jωε ̄E ⋅d̄a,
(2.54)
and apply it to a line integral shown in Fig. 2.3. As dl →0, the right side of (2.54)
vanishes and the left side becomes
(Ht1 −Ht2)ΔL = 0,
(2.55)
where Ht1 and Ht2 are the tangential components of the magnetic field in media 1
and 2, respectively. Similarly, from (2.40) we get
(Et1 −Et2)ΔL = 0,
(2.56)
where Et1 and Et2 are the tangential components of the electric field in media 1 and
2. We therefore state that the tangential components of the electric field and magnetic
fields must be continuous, respectively, across the boundary. Mathematically, we
write
̂n × ̄E1 = ̂n × ̄E2,
(2.57a)
̄n × ̄H1 = ̂n × ̄H2,
(2.57b)
where ̂n is the unit vector normal to the interface and (E1, H1) and (E2, H2) arethefields
in the medium with ε1 and ε2, respectively. If a surface current Jsf (amperes/meter)
exists on the boundary, we have
̂n × ̄H1 −̂n × ̄H2 = ̄Jsf .
(2.58)
We can also obtain the conditions on the normal components of the electric and
magnetic fields on the boundary. In the absence of the source (̄Js = 0 and ρs = 0),
we apply the divergence theorem to (2.42) and (2.43) for a pillbox volume shown in
Fig. 2.4, and in the limit dl →0 we get
(Dn1 −Dn2) Δa = 0,
(Bn1 −Bn2) Δa = 0.

his states that the normal components of ̄D and ̄B must be continuous across the
boundary. Mathematically, we write
̄D1 ⋅̂n = ̄D2 ⋅̂n,
̄B1 ⋅̂n = ̄B2 ⋅̂n.
(2.60)
If a surface charge exists on the boundary, we have
(Dn1 −Dn2)Δa = ρsfΔa,
(2.61)
or
̄D1 ⋅̂n −̄D2 ⋅̂n = ρsf.
(2.62)
Here ρsf is the surface charge density (coulombs/meter2).
Let us examine how we use the boundary conditions (2.57), (2.58), (2.60), and
(2.62) to solve electromagnetic problems. According to the uniqueness theorem,
which is discussed in Section 2.10, only one unique solution exists among all the
possible solutions of Maxwell’s equations that satisfy both Maxwell’s equations
and the boundary conditions. Thus it is important to determine what constitutes the
necessary and sufficient boundary conditions in order to yield the unique solution.
(See Morse and Feshbach (1953), Chapter 6, for more details.)
Here, we first note that (2.60) is not independent of (2.57a) and (2.57b) for a
time-harmonic case since (2.42) and (2.43) can be derived by taking the divergence
of (2.40) and (2.41), respectively. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient boundary
conditions are the continuity of the tangential electric and magnetic fields as given in
(2.57a) and (2.57b).
If the second medium is a perfect conductor, the fields inside the conductor vanish,
and the necessary and sufficient boundary condition is that the tangential component
of the electric field is zero on the boundary:
̂n × ̄E1 = 0.
(2.63)
The surface current density is then given by ̄Jsf = ̂n × ̄H1.
If the second medium is a good conductor, so that ε′ ≪ε′′, the wave can only
penetrate a distance of the skin depth given by (2/ωμσ)1/2 (Chapter 3). If the radius

18
FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
of curvature of the surface is much greater than the skin depth, the following con-
dition, called the Leontovich impedance boundary condition, holds approximately
(Brekhovskikh, 1960):
̄Et = Zs(̂n × ̄H),
(2.64)
where ̄Et is the electric field tangential to the surface and Zs = (μ/ε)1/2 ≈(jμω/σ)1/2.
This means that the ratio of the tangential electric field to the tangential magnetic field
is constant at the surface. The Leontovich boundary condition eliminates the need to
consider the field in the second medium and thus leads to considerable mathematical
simplification.
In addition to the foregoing conditions at the boundary, if the region under con-
sideration extends to infinity, the wave must be outgoing at infinity. This requirement
at infinity is called the Sommerfeld radiation condition (Sommerfeld, 1949). For a
scalar field ψ, the radiation condition is given by
lim
r→∞r
(∂ψ
∂r + jkψ
)
= 0,
(2.65)
where k = ω/c. For electromagnetic fields, they are given by (Collin and Zucker,
1969)
lim
r→∞r
[(μ

̂r × ̄H + ̄E
]
= 0,
lim
r→∞r
[
̂r × ̄E −
(μ
ε
)1∕2 ̄H
]
= 0.
(2.66)
This means that the field is outgoing and the Poynting vector is pointed outward and
decreases as r–2. The radial components Er and Hr must decrease faster than r–1.
If the region includes a sharp edge, the field can become infinite, but the energy
stored around the edge must be finite. Thus the field must satisfy the edge condition,
which is discussed in Appendix 7.C. In general, therefore, the complete mathematical
description of the electromagnetic problem includes Maxwell’s equations, boundary
conditions, the radiation condition, and the edge condition.
2.5
ENERGY RELATIONS AND POYNTING’S THEOREM
Let us consider the general time-varying electromagnetic fields satisfying Maxwell’s
equations (2.1)–(2.4). To obtain the energy relations, we use the vector identity
∇⋅(̄A × ̄B) = ̄B ⋅∇× ̄A −̄A ⋅∇× ̄B
(2.67)
www.ebook3000.com

ENERGY RELATIONS AND POYNTING’S THEOREM
19
and let ̄A = ̄E and ̄B = ̄H. We then substitute ∇× ̄E from (2.2) and ∇× ̄H from (2.1)
into the right side of (2.67) and obtain
∇⋅( ̄E × ̄H) + ̄H ⋅∂̄B
∂t + ̄E ⋅∂̄D
∂t + ̄E ⋅̄J = 0,
(2.68)
where all field quantities are real functions of position ̄r and time t. The vector
̄S = ̄E × ̄H is called the Poynting vector and represents the flow of the power flux per
unit area. It is the power flux density and its unit is watts/meter2.
Equation (2.68) is a mathematical representation of Poynting’s theorem. Let us
examine its physical meaning. In a nondispersive, lossless medium, ̄D = ε ̄E and +
and ε and μ are real constants. We can then identify the electromagnetic energy
density W:
W = We + Wm = 1
2ε ̄E ⋅̄E + 1
2μ ̄H ⋅̄H,
(2.69)
where W is the sum of the electric We and magnetic Wm energy densities. Poynting’s
theorem (2.68) can then be stated as
∇⋅̄S + ∂
∂tW + ̄E ⋅̄J = 0.
(2.70)
The physical meaning of this can be seen more clearly in the following integral form
obtained by applying the divergence theorem to (2.70):
−∫S
̄S ⋅d̄a = ∂
∂t ∫V
WdV + ∫V
̄E ⋅̄JdV.
(2.71)
Here the left side of (2.71) is the total power flow into the volume V. The first term
on the right represents the time rate of increase of the total electromagnetic energy
inside the volume and the second term represents the total power dissipation in the
volume. Thus (2.71) states that the total energy flow into a volume per unit time is
equal to the sum of the increase in the total electromagnetic energy and the energy
dissipation per unit time in the volume.
In many practical problems, we deal with time-harmonic electromagnetic fields,
and it is necessary to consider Poynting’s theorem for the phasor field quantities. In
a time-harmonic case, we use the complex Poynting vector
̄S = 1
2
̄E × ̄H∗,
(2.72)
where ̄E and ̄H are phasors. The magnitudes | ̄E| and | ̄H| are peak values, and therefore
the rms values are (1∕
√
2)| ̄E| and (1∕
√
2)| ̄H|. ̄S gives the direction and the rms value
of the complex power flux density. The real part of ̄S represents the real power flux

identity (2.67), we write
∇⋅̄S = 1

̄H∗⋅∇× ̄E −1
2
̄E ⋅∇× ̄H∗.
(2.73)
Substituting Maxwell’s equations (2.40) and (2.41) into this, we get Poynting’s the-
orem in the following complex form:
∇⋅̄S + 2jω(Wm −We) + L + 1

Here ε and μ are complex dielectric constant and permeability, respectively (μ is
generalized to be complex). We and Wm are the time-averaged electric and magnetic
stored energy densities and are equal to the average of 1

The third term L in (2.74) is real and positive and represents the power dissipation
per unit volume in a lossy medium. The last term in (2.74) is the power absorbed
by the source current ̄Js. The power emitted from the source ̄Js is therefore given
by −1

s . This can be seen by taking the volume integral of (2.74) over the source
volume only. Then We, Wm, and L are zero and the total power emitted is equal to the
volume integral of −1
2 ̄E ⋅̄J∗
s .
The Poynting vector ̄S is in general complex, and its real part represents the real
power flow and its imaginary part represents the reactive power. Taking the real and

Equation (2.76a) states that the real power flowing into a unit volume (−∇⋅̄Sr)
plus the power supplied by the source −1
2Re( ̄E ⋅̄J∗
s ) per unit volume is equal to the
power loss per unit volume L. Similarly, (2.76b) represents the reactive power per
unit volume due to the power flow, the source, and the stored energy densities.
The specific absorption rate (SAR) is used to represent the power loss per unit mass
of biological media when the incident power flux density is 1 mW/cm2 (Table 2.2).
If the density of the medium is given by ρ (kg/m3), the SAR is given by
SAR = L

W∕kg.

For biological media, μ′′ = 0, and therefore,
SAR = ωε0ε′′|E|2

(2.78)
The density ρ is usually taken to be approximately equal to that of water (ρ = 103
kg/m3).
The definition of the time-averaged electric and magnetic stored energy densities
as given in (2.74) and (2.75) is valid if ε and μ are independent of frequency. For a
dispersive medium, the time-averaged electric and magnetic stored energy densities
are given by

Note that if ε and μ are constant, (2.79) reduces to those given in (2.74). The derivation
of (2.79) requires consideration of ωε in the neighborhood of the operating frequency
and is given in Landau and Lifshitz (1960) and Yeh and Liu (1972).

VECTOR AND SCALAR POTENTIALS
Maxwell’s equations are vector differential equations and each equation represents
three scalar equations for each of three orthogonal components. It would be more
convenient, therefore, if the vector problem was reduced to a scalar problem with a
fewer number of equations. This has been done in electrostatics and magnetostatics
by using electrostatic and vector potentials to describe electric and magnetic fields,
respectively. The concept of these potentials can be extended to electromagnetic fields
in the following manner.
We assume that the medium is isotropic, homogeneous, and nondispersive, and
therefore, μ and ε are scalar and constant. First, we note from (2.4) that the divergence
of ̄B is zero, and recalling that the divergence of the curl of any vector is zero, ̄B can
be expressed by the curl of an arbitrary vector ̄A, called the vector potential.
∇⋅̄B = 0,
(2.80)
̄B = ∇× ̄A.
(2.81)
Then the second Maxwell’s equation (2.2) becomes
∇×
(
̄E + ∂̄A
∂t
)
= 0.
(2.82)
Since the curl of the gradient of any scalar function is zero, the bracketed factor
is represented by the gradient of an arbitrary scalar function ϕ, which is called the
scalar potential.
̄E + ∂̄A
∂t = −∇ϕ.
(2.83)
Substituting (2.81) and (2.83) into the first of Maxwell’s equation (2.1), we get
−∇× ∇× ̄A −με∂2 ̄A
∂t2 −με∇∂ϕ
∂t = −μ̄J.
(2.84)
Now, substituting (2.83) into (2.3), we get
∇2ϕ + ∂
∂t∇⋅̄A = −ρ
ε.
(2.85)
Alternatively, we can get (2.85) by taking the divergence of (2.84) and using the
continuity equation (2.12). Equations (2.84) and (2.85) are the two equations, the
vector and scalar potentials must satisfy.

VECTOR AND SCALAR POTENTIALS
23
The vector potential ̄A above is defined only through ∇× ̄A in (2.81). In general, a
vector field ̄A consists of a curl-free component ̄A1 and a divergence-free component
̄A2.
̄A = ̄A1 + ̄A2,
∇× ̄A1 = 0,
and
∇⋅̄A2 = 0.
(2.86)
Since ∇× ̄A = ∇× ̄A2 and ∇⋅̄A = ∇⋅̄A1, we can still choose any ∇⋅̄A without
affecting ̄E and ̄H. If we choose ∇⋅̄A so that it satisfies the Lorentz condition
∇⋅̄A + με∂ϕ
∂t = 0,
(2.87)
(2.84) and (2.85) become
∇2 ̄A −με∂2 ̄A
∂t2 = −μ̄J,
(2.88)
∇2ϕ −με∂2ϕ
∂t2 = −ρ
ε,
(2.89)
where ∇2 ̄A = −∇× ∇× ̄A + ∇(∇⋅̄A), and ̄J and ρ are related through the continuity
equation:
∇⋅̄J + ∂ρ
∂t = 0.
(2.90)
Once (2.88) and (2.89) are solved for ̄A and ϕ, the fields are given by (2.81) and
(2.83).
̄E = −∂̄A
∂t −∇ϕ,
(2.91)
̄B = ∇× ̄A.
(2.92)
Another useful choice of ∇⋅̄A is the Coulomb gauge, for which ∇⋅̄A = 0. This
is particularly useful for a source-free region (̄J = 0, ρ = 0). In this case, (2.84) and
(2.85) become
∇2 ̄A −με∂2 ̄A
∂t = 0
and
∇2ϕ = 0.
(2.93)
The fields are given by
̄E = −∂̄A
∂t
and
̄B = ∇× ̄A.
(2.94)

24
FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
For a dispersive, isotropic, and homogeneous medium, the time-harmonic
Maxwell’s equations (2.40)–(2.43) must be used. We then obtain
∇2 ̄A + ω2με ̄A = −μ ̄Js,
∇2ϕ + ω2μεϕ = −ρs
εc
,
(2.95)
and the Lorentz condition
∇⋅̄A + jωμεϕ = 0.
(2.96)
Equations (2.95) and (2.96) constitute the basic formulations of electromagnetic
problems in terms of the vector and scalar potentials, and the fields are obtained
by (2.91) and (2.92) from A and ϕ with ∂/∂t replaced by jω. If the medium is
inhomogeneous, however, the equations above do not hold, and it is more convenient
to go back and start with the original Maxwell’s equations.
2.7
ELECTRIC HERTZ VECTOR
It is possible to combine the vector and scalar potentials and the Lorentz condition and
form a single vector called the Hertz vector, from which all the field components can
be derived. This useful formulation has been applied to many engineering problems.
Let us define the electric Hertz vector ̄π such that
̄A = με∂̄π
∂t
and
ϕ = −∇⋅̄π.
(2.97)
Then the Lorentz condition is satisfied automatically. Furthermore, we combine ̄J
and ρ consistent with the continuity equation by using ̄P:
̄J = ∂̄P
∂t
and
ρ = −∇⋅̄P.
(2.98)
Then we get a single vector equation
∇2̄π −με∂2̄π
∂t2 = −̄P
ε ,
(2.99)
from which all the electromagnetic fields can be derived.
̄E = ∇(∇⋅̄π) −με ∂2

and
̄H = ε∇× ̄∂π

DUALITY PRINCIPLE AND SYMMETRY OF MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS
25
Equations (2.99) and (2.100) constitute the basic formulation in terms of the electric
Hertz vector ̄π. The vector ̄P is called the electric polarization vector and is equal to
the dipole moment per unit volume of the exciting source.
For a time-harmonic case (2.40) to (2.43) applicable to a dispersive medium, we
have
∇2̄π + ω2με̄π = −
̄Js
jωε,
(2.101)
̄E = ∇(∇⋅̄π) + ω2με̄π = −∇× ∇× ̄π −
̄Js
jωε,
(2.102)
̄H = jωε∇× ̄π,
(2.103)
where ̄Js is the source current density and ε is the complex dielectric constant.
Equation (2.101) gives scalar wave equation for each Cartesian component πx, πy,
and πz. Care should be exercised in the use of (2.101) for the component of ̄π in other
coordinate systems. See Section 3.1.
2.8
DUALITY PRINCIPLE AND SYMMETRY
OF MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS
At present, no magnetic charge has been found to exist in nature and Maxwell’s
equations contain only electric charges and currents. In practice, however, it is often
convenient to use the concept of fictitious magnetic currents and charges. For example,
we show later that a small current loop is equivalent to a magnetic current. If we
include the fictitious magnetic current density ̄Jm and charge density ρm, Maxwell’s
equations take the following symmetric form:
∇× ̄H = ε ̄∂E
∂t + ̄J,
(2.104)
∇× ̄E = −μ∂̄H
∂t −̄Jm,
(2.105)
∇⋅̄B = ρm,
(2.106)
∇⋅̄D = ρ.
(2.107)
Because of this symmetry, we can interchange ̄E and ̄H, ̄J and Jm, ρ and ρm, and ε
and μ from the unprimed fields to the new primed fields in the following manner:
̄E →̄H
̄J →̄J′
m
ρ →ρ′
m μ →ε′
̄H →−̄E ̄Jm →−̄J′ ρm →−ρ′ ε →μ′
(2.108)
Then the primed fields satisfy the same Maxwell’s equations. Using this duality
principle, when a solution is known for the unprimed fields, the solution for the
primed fields can easily be obtained.

26
FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
The duality relations above are not the only ones to transform the unprimed fields
to the primed fields. We can also use the following transformation without affecting
Maxwell’s equations:
̄E →
√μ
ε
̄H
̄J →
√ε
μ
̄J′
m
ρ →
√ε
μ ρ′
m
̄H →−
√ε
μ
̄E
̄J′
m →−
√μ
ε
̄J′
ρm →−
√
ε
mρ′.
(2.109)
The transformation does not require the interchange of ε and μ, and therefore it is
useful in dealing with the field relationship for the same medium.
2.9
MAGNETIC HERTZ VECTOR
The symmetric Maxwell’s equations (2.104)–(2.107) contain the electric current ̄J
and the magnetic current ̄Jm. Therefore, the total field consists of the field due to ̄J
and the field due to ̄Jm. The field due to ̄J was already obtained in Section 2.7 in
terms of the electric Hertz vector ̄π. Similarly, the field due to ̄Jm can be obtained by
using the transformation (2.108) and by replacing the electric Hertz vector ̄π with the
magnetic Hertz vector ̄πm. Thus we have the following vector equation corresponding
to (2.99):
∇2 ̄πm −με ∂2
∂t2 ̄πm = −̄M
and
̄M =
̄Jms
jωμ,
(2.110)
where ̄M is the magnetic polarization vector. The fields corresponding to (2.100) are
given by
̄E = −μ∇× ∂̄πm
∂t
and
̄H = ∇(∇⋅̄πm) −με ∂2
∂t2 ̄πm = ∇× ∇s ̄πm −̄M.
(2.111)
The magnetic polarization vector ̄M is the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume.
For a time-harmonic case, we have
∇2 ̄πm +ω2με ̄πm = −
̄Jms
jωμ,
(2.112)
̄E = −jωμ∇× ̄πm,
(2.113)
̄H = ∇(∇⋅̄πm) + ω2με ̄πm = ∇× ∇× ̄πm −
̄Jms

(2.114)
where ̄Jms is the magnetic source current density.

UNIQUENESS THEOREM
27
2.10
UNIQUENESS THEOREM
For a passive network with N terminals, if N voltages v1, v2,…, vN are applied at these
N terminals, all the voltages and currents inside the network are uniquely determined.
Similarly, if N currents I1, I2,…, IN are applied at the terminals, this also uniquely
determines all the voltages and currents. Or, we can specify the voltages at some of
the N terminals and specify the currents at the rest of the terminals. This also gives a
unique distribution of voltages and currents. It is also obvious that we cannot specify
both voltages v1,…, vN and currents I1,…, IN at the N terminals. These conditions
appear to be obvious for network problems. However, in electromagnetic problems,
these conditions are not obvious since we need to consider a volume V surrounded
by a surface S and ask: What field quantities should be specified on the surface S in
order to uniquely determine all fields inside?
The quantities could be tangential or normal, electric or magnetic fields, or dis-
placement or flux vectors. Among all these quantities, which can give the unique
field inside the surface S? We will show that one of the following three conditions is
necessary and sufficient to determine uniquely all the fields inside.
1. The tangential electric field ̂n × ̄E is specified on S.
2. The tangential magnetic field ̂n × ̄H is specified on S.
3. The tangential electric field ̂n × ̄E is specified on a part of S and the tangential
magnetic field ̂n × ̄H is specified on the rest of S.
(2.115)
Note that these conditions correspond to the three conditions mentioned above for
network problems.
We shall prove (2.115) for a time-harmonic case. Let us consider two different
fields, ( ̄E1, ̄H1) and ( ̄E2, ̄H2), both of which satisfy Maxwell’s equations. We will
show that if both satisfy one of the conditions in (2.115) on S, these two fields
are identical within V, and thus the field in V is unique. To show this, consider the
fields ̄Ed = E1 −̄E2 and ̄Hd = ̄H1 −̄H2. Since both ( ̄E1, ̄H1) and ( ̄E2, ̄H2) satisfy
Maxwell’s equations, ( ̄Ed, ̄Hd) also satisfies Maxwell’s equations and consequently,
satisfies Poynting’s theorem (2.74). Noting that in a passive medium, the source
current ̄Js is zero, we write (2.74) in the following integral form for the volume V:
∫S
1
2
̄Ed × ̄Hd × ̄H∗
d ⋅d̄a = −2jω ∫V
(ε0ε′
4 | ̄Ed |2 −μ0μ′

)
dV
−∫V
(ωε0ε′′
2
| ̄Ed |2 + ωμ0μ′′
2
| ̄Ed |2
)
dV.
(2.116)
If both ( ̄E1, ̄H1) and ( ̄E2, ̄H2) satisfy one of the conditions (2.115), the left side of
(2.116) is zero, since ̄Ed × ̄H∗
d ⋅̂n = ̂n × ̄Ed ⋅̄H∗
d = 0, where d̄a = ̂nda. Therefore, the
right side of equation (2.116) must be zero. The first integral is purely imaginary.
The second integral on the right side of (2.116) is always positive and real whenever
ε′′ ≠0 and μ′′ ≠0 unless ̄Ed = 0 and ̄Hd = 0. For any physical medium, ε′′ and μ′′

28
FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
are always nonzero and positive, and therefore ̄Ed and ̄Hd must be zero, proving that
̄E1 = ̄E2 and ̄H1 = ̄H2 and the field inside the surface S is unique as long as one of
(2.115) is satisfied.
Note that if a lossless cavity is inside S, the field inside the cavity is independent
of the field on S and cannot be determined uniquely by the field on S. However, a
completely lossless cavity does not exist and thus the uniqueness theorem can be
applied to any physical medium. For a general time-varying case, a similar proof can
be given to show that (2.115) is also a necessary and sufficient condition (Stratton,
1941, p. 486).
2.11
RECIPROCITY THEOREM
It is well understood that the reciprocity theorem holds for any linear passive net-
work. For example, if a voltage Va applied at the input terminal produces a short
circuit current Ia at the output terminal, a voltage Vb applied at the output terminal
produces the short circuit current Ib at the input satisfying the following reciprocity
relationship:
Ia
Va
= Ib
Vb
.
(2.117)
In electromagnetics, the equivalent relationship is called the “Lorentz reciprocity
theorem.”
Let us consider time-harmonic electromagnetic fields. We consider the field
( ̄Ea, ̄Ha) produced by ̄Ja and ̄Jma. We also consider the field ( ̄Eb, ̄Hb) produced
by ̄Jb and ̄Jmb in the same medium (Fig. 2.5). We first note the following:
∇⋅( ̄Ea × ̄Hb) = ̄Hb ⋅∇× ̄Ea −̄Ea ⋅∇× ̄Hb .
(2.118)
We then use Maxwell’s equations for ( ̄Ea, ̄Ha):
∇× ̄Ea = −jωμ ̄Ha −̄Jma,
∇× ̄Ha = jωε ̄Ea + ̄Ja .
(2.119)
We also use the similar equations for ( ̄Eb, ̄Hb). We then get
∇⋅( ̄Ea × ̄Hb) = −jωμ ̄Ha ⋅̄Hb −̄Hb ⋅̄Jma −jωε ̄Ea ⋅̄Hb −̄Ea ⋅̄Jb .
(2.120)
Interchanging a and b, we get a similar equation for ∇⋅( ̄Eb × ̄Ha). Subtracting one
from another, we get the Lorentz reciprocity theorem.
∇⋅( ̄Ea × ̄Hb −̄Eb × ̄Ha) = −( ̄Ea ⋅̄Jb −̄Ha ⋅̄Jmb) + ̄Eb ⋅̄Ja −̄Hb ⋅̄Jma . (2.121)

Lorentz reciprocity theorem.
In order to examine the meaning of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem, let us consider
two special cases. If the volume V contains no exciting sources, ̄J = ̄Jm = 0, we have
the following Lorentz reciprocity theorem applicable to any closed surface enclosing
a source-free region:
∫S
( ̄Ea × ̄Hb −̄Eb × ̄Ha) ⋅d̄a = 0.
(2.122)
Next, we consider a case where the volume V extends to infinity. In this case, at
a large distance r from the source, the field component behaves as a spherical wave
and is proportional to (1/r) exp(–jkr) and since d̄a is proportional to r2, the left side
of (2.121) is proportional to exp(–j2kr). Since k = k0n has a negative imaginary part
for any physical medium, the left side of (2.121) tends to zero as r →∞. Therefore,
the volume integral of the right side of (2.121) taken over the entire space extending
to infinity is zero.
We rewrite this reciprocity relationship using the following form:
⟨a, b⟩= ⟨b, a⟩,
(2.123)
where ⟨a, b⟩= ∫∞( ̄Ea ⋅̄Jb −̄Ha ⋅̄Jmb)dV. This shows that the electric field ̄Ea at a
point ̄r1 due to the current ̄Ja at ̄r2 is the same as the electric field ̄Eb at ̄r2 due to
the same current ̄Jb = ̄Ja at ̄r1. It should be easy to see the correspondence between
(2.117) and (2.123). The quantity ⟨a, b⟩given in (2.123) is called the reaction by
Rumsey (1954) and is useful in solving boundary value problems.

ACOUSTIC WAVES
Although electromagnetic waves are vector fields, there are several reasons why we
wish to examine scalar fields. First, electromagnetic problems can often be approxi-
mated by scalar problems because they reveal many important features of the problem
without excessive mathematical complexities. Also, in cases such as two-dimensional
problems, vector electromagnetic problems can be reduced to scalar problems. In
addition, the study of scalar acoustic problems is of practical interest in many appli-
cations, including ultrasound in medicine and ocean acoustics.
For acoustic waves, the pressure variation p(̄r, t) replaces the electric field ̄E(̄r, t)
in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. In this section, we present a brief description of basic
formulations for acoustic waves propagating in material media. We may classify
material media into fluids and solids. Fluids include both gases and liquids and are
in general viscous. However, often the effects of viscosity are negligible, and we
consider nonviscous fluids, which are also called perfect fluids. Fluids are in general
compressible, but when the density of the medium can be assumed constant, they are
called incompressible fluids. Propagation of an acoustic wave takes place in elastic
solids, viscous compressible fluids, and perfect compressible fluids. In this section,
we outline the formulation for acoustic-wave propagation in perfect compressible
fluids such as gases and liquids. Examples include fog particles in air and bubbles in
water (Morse and Ingard, 1968).
There are two fundamental equations: the equation of motion and the equation of
conservation of mass. The equation of motion for a small elementary volume of the
medium is
ρd ̄V
dt + gradp = 0,
(2.124)
where ρ is density (kg/m3), ̄V is the particle velocity (m/s), and p is pressure (N/m2).
The particle velocity ̄V is the velocity of the elementary volume of the fluid and
should be distinguished from the velocity c of an acoustic wave in the medium. The
derivative d/dt is the time rate of change in a coordinate system attached to a particular
portion of a fluid and moving with the fluid. This is called the Lagrangian description.
In contrast, ∂/∂t is the time derivative at a fixed point in space as the fluid flows past
that point and is called the Eulerian description. They are related through
d
dt = ∂
∂t + ( ̄V ⋅grad).
(2.125)
The conservation of mass is given by
∇⋅(ρ ̄V) + ∂ρ
∂t = 0.
(2.126)
Let us decompose p, ρ, and ̄V into their average values p0, ρ0, and ̄V0 and the small
vibrating acoustic-wave components p1, ρ1, and ̄V1.
www.ebook3000.com

ACOUSTIC WAVES
31
First, we assume that the fluid is stationary, ̄V0 = 0, and the magnitudes of acoustic
pressure p1 and density ρ1 are small compared with the average values p0 and ρ0.
Then keeping the linear terms, (2.124) and (2.126) become
ρ0
∂̄V1
∂t
+ gradp1 = 0,
ρ0∇⋅̄V1 +∂ρ1
∂t = 0.
(2.127)
In general, pressure p is a function of density ρ and therefore for small p1 and ρ1, we
can expand p in Taylor’s series and keep the first two terms.
p = p0 + p1 = p0 +
(∂p
∂ρ
)
p0
ρ1.
(2.128)
Since p1 is linearly related to ρ1, we write
p1 = c2ρ1,
where
c2 =
(∂p
∂ρ
)
p0
.
(2.129)
The value of the constant c depends on the material under consideration, and it is the
velocity of an acoustic wave in that medium. Note the difference between the particle
velocity ̄V1 and the acoustic velocity c. Using (2.129), we express ρ1 in (2.127) by p1.
∇⋅̄V1 + 1
c2ρ0
∂p1
∂t = 0.
(2.130)
Taking the divergence of ̄V1 in (2.127) and substituting into (2.130), we get
∇⋅
(

ρ0
∇p1
)
−κ ∂2p1
∂t2 = 0,
(2.131)
where κ = 1/c2ρ0 is called the compressibility.
Equation (2.131) is the basic acoustic wave equation for a stationary medium.
Note that (1/ρ0) is inside the divergence operation. For a uniform medium, this can
be taken outside the divergence,
∇2p1 −1
c2
∂2p1
∂t2 = 0.
(2.132)
For a time-harmonic case exp(jωt), we have
(∇2 + k2)p1 = 0,
̄V1 = −1
jωρ0
∇p1.
(2.133)

32
FUNDAMENTAL FIELD EQUATIONS
The boundary conditions at an interface between two media are:
1. Continuity of pressure p1
2. Continuity of the normal component of the particle velocity ̄V1 [or (1/ρ0)
(∂p1/∂n), where ∂/∂n is the normal derivative]
The power flux density vector ̄S is given by
̄S = 1
2p1 ̄V∗
1 .
(2.134)
Alternatively, we can use the velocity potential ψ. For a uniform medium, the curl
of ̄V1 is zero from (2.127), and thus it is possible to express ̄V1 in terms of a scalar
function ψ.
̄V1 = −grad ψ.
(2.135)
The function ψ is called the velocity potential, and it satisfies the wave equation
∇2ψ −1

For a time-harmonic case [exp(jωt)], we have

k = ω

̄V1 = −grad ψ,
p1 = jωρ0ψ.
(2.138)
The boundary conditions at an interface are:
1. Continuity of ρ0ψ
2. Continuity of ∂ψ/∂n
For a plane acoustic wave propagating in the x direction, we have from (2.133)
p1 = A0 exp(−jkx)
̄V1 = ̂x p1
ρ0c.
(2.139)
The ratio ρ0c of p1 to V1 is called the characteristic impedance. Its MKS unit is rayl
(after Rayleigh) and 1 rayl = 1 kg/m2s. The MKS unit for acoustic pressure is Pa
(pascal) and 1 Pa = 1 N/m2 = 10 μbar.
In seawater at 13◦C and with a salinity of 35 (in parts by weight per thousand), the
standard sound velocity is taken to be 1500 m/s, the standard characteristic impedance
is ρ0c = 1.54 × 106 rayl, and the density ρ0 = 1026 kg/m3. Air at a temperature of

media and reflection and refraction of plane waves by layered media. We then consider
the propagation characteristics of guided waves along layered media. This gives us
an opportunity to discuss various types of guided waves and to introduce the idea of
complex waves. The chapter concludes with the problem of wave propagation in a
medium whose refractive index varies as a function of z only. Here we discuss the
WKB approximation and the turning point.
3.1
WAVE EQUATION FOR A TIME-HARMONIC CASE
Maxwell’s equations are the coupled first-order vector differential equations for the
two field quantities ̄E and ̄H. We can combine these two equations, eliminate one
of the field quantities, and obtain the uncoupled second-order vector differential
equation for one field quantity in the following manner.
Let us write Maxwell’s equations for a time-harmonic wave
∇× ̄H = jωε ̄E,
(3.1)
∇× ̄E = −jωμ ̄H,
(3.2)
where ε = ε0 εr is the complex dielectric constant (permittivity) and μ = μ0⋅μr is the
permeability. μr = 1 for most materials except for magnetic material. We consider a
homogeneous medium where ε and μ are constant.

WAVES IN INHOMOGENEOUS AND LAYERED MEDIA
To combine (3.1) and (3.2), we take the curl of (3.2) and substitute into (3.1).
We get
∇× (∇× ̄E) −ω2με ̄E = 0.
(3.3)
This is a vector wave equation and can be decomposed into three components in three
orthogonal directions.
For the special case of a Cartesian coordinate system, we use the following identity:
−∇× ∇× ̄E + ∇(∇⋅̄E) = ∇2 ̄E.
(3.4)
Together with ∇⋅̄D = 0, we get the following scalar wave equation for each compo-
nent Ex, Ey, and Ez:
(∇2 + k2)Ex = 0,
(3.5)
where ∇2 is the Laplacian, k = k0 n is the wave number in the medium, k0 = ω(μ0
ε0)1/2 = ω/c = (2π)/λ0 is the wave number in free space, c is the speed of light in free
space, λ0 is the wavelength in free space, and n = (μr εr)1/2 is the refractive index of
the medium.
The identity (3.4) is true for the Cartesian system, but care should be exercised in
the use of (3.4) for other coordinate systems. For example, in the cylindrical coordinate
system (ρ, ϕ, z), the z component of the left side of (3.4) is equal to ∇2Ez, the right
side. However, the ρ (or ϕ) component of the left side is not equal to ∇2Eρ (or ∇2Eϕ).
Once we solve (3.5) and obtain ̄E, we can easily obtain ̄H by (3.2):
̄H = −1
jωμ∇× ̄E.
(3.6)
3.2
TIME-HARMONIC PLANE-WAVE PROPAGATION
IN HOMOGENEOUS MEDIA
Let us consider a time-harmonic plane wave propagating in the z direction. First,
we note that all the fields are functions of z only and since ∇⋅̄E = ∂Ez∕∂z = 0, Ez
is independent of z. Therefore, Ez varying in z is zero, and we conclude that Ez =
0 for a plane wave propagating in the z direction. Similarly, we have Hz = 0 for a
plane wave from ∇⋅̄H = 0. Since all the components of ̄E and ̄H are transverse to
the direction of the wave propagation, the plane electromagnetic field is called the
transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave.
Let us assume that the field is linearly polarized in the x direction (Ex ≠0, Ey =
0). Solving (3.5) and using (3.6), we get
Ex = E0e−jkz
(3.7)
Hy = E0
η e−jkz,
(3.8)

POLARIZATION

where η = (μ/ε)1/2 = η0(μr/εr)1/2 is the characteristic impedance of the medium, and
η0 = (μ0/ε0)1/2 ≈120π ohms is the characteristic impedance of free space.
In a lossy medium, using n = n′ – jn′′, we get
Ex = E0 exp(−jkz) = E0 exp(−jβz −αz),
Hy = Ez
η ,
(3.9)
where β = k0n′ = 2π/λ = ω/V is called the phase constant, λ the wavelength in the
medium, V the phase velocity, and α the attenuation constant. Also note that at the
distance δ = α−1, the wave attenuates to the value of exp(–1) of the magnitude at
z = 0. This distance δ is called the skin depth of the medium, because the wave cannot
penetrate in the medium much farther than this depth. For example, if the medium is
highly conducting,
εr = ε′ −jε′′ ≈−j σ
ωε0.
(3.10)
Therefore, we get
δ ≈
(
2
ωμ0σ
)1∕2
,
(3.11)
In general, however, the skin depth δ is given by α−1 = (k0n′′)−1.
A plane wave propagating in an arbitrary direction ̂ι is given by
̄E = ̄E0e−j ̄K⋅̄r,
(3.12)
We also note that for a plane wave,
∇e−j ̄K⋅̄r = −j ̄Ke−j ̄K⋅̄r.
(3.13)
Therefore, ∇⋅̄D = 0 means that ̄K ⋅̄D = 0. Similarly ̄K ⋅̄B = 0, showing that ̄D and
̄B are perpendicular to the direction of propagation ̂ι.
3.3
POLARIZATION
In Section 3.2, we considered a linearly polarized plane wave polarized in the x
direction (Ex ≠0, Ey = 0, and Ez = 0) and propagating in the z direction. In general,
however, the electric field vector ̄E can be polarized in any direction (Ex ≠0, Ey ≠0,
and Ez = 0). If Ex and Ey are in phase, the electric field vector ̄E at a given location is
always pointed in a fixed direction, and the wave is said to be linearly polarized. For
a linearly polarized wave, the direction of the electric vector is called the direction of
polarization, and the plane containing the electric vector and the direction of wave
propagation is called the plane of polarization (Fig. 3.1a).

Polarizations: (a) linear; (b) elliptic; (c) circular (right handed).
In general, when Ex and Ey are not in phase, we write
Ex = E1ejδ1,
Ey = E2ejδ2,
(3.14)
where δ = δ1 – δ2 is the phase difference. As a function of time, Ex and Ey are
given by
Ex = E1 cos(ωt + δ1),
Ey = E2 cos(ωt + δ2).
(3.15)
If we eliminate ωt from (3.15), we get an equation to describe the locus of the tip of
the electric vector ̄E. To do so, we write
Ey
E2
= cos A,
A = ωt + δ2,

cos δ = sin2 δ.
(3.18)
This is an equation of an ellipse, and thus the wave is said to be elliptically polarized
(Fig. 3.1b).
If the phase difference is exactly 90◦or –90◦and the magnitudes E1 and E2 are
the same (E1 = E2 = E0), then (3.18) becomes an equation of a circle, and the wave
is said to be circularly polarized (Fig. 3.1c). If δ = +90◦, the rotation of the electric
field vector and the direction of the wave propagation form a right-handed screw,
and this is called the right-handed circular polarization (RHC), and Ex and Ey are
related by
Ex = +jEy
(3.19)
If δ = –90◦, this is called the left-handed circular polarization (LHC) and Ex and Ey
satisfy
Ex = −jEy.
(3.20)
This definition of RHC and LHC is normally used in electrical engineering and IEEE
publications. However, in physics, RHC refers to the wave whose electric vector is
rotating in the clockwise direction as observed by the receiver, while the engineering
definition of RHC refers to the wave whose electric vector is rotating in the clockwise
direction as viewed by the transmitter. Therefore, RHC in engineering definition is
LHC in physics.
The polarized waves described above are deterministic, which means that the field
quantities are definite functions of time and position. In contrast, if the field quantities
are completely random and Ex and Ey are uncorrelated, the wave is called unpolarized.
The light from the sun can be considered unpolarized. In many situations the waves
may be partially polarized. We include a detailed discussion of this topic, including
Stokes’ vectors and the Poincar´e sphere, in Chapter 10.
3.4
PLANE-WAVE INCIDENCE ON A PLANE BOUNDARY:
PERPENDICULAR POLARIZATION (s POLARIZATION)
Let us consider the reflection and refraction of a plane wave incident on a single bound-
ary separating two media with dielectric constants ε1 and ε2 and permeabilities μ1
and μ2, respectively (Fig. 3.2). Both media can be lossy, and therefore, ε1, ε2, μ1, and
μ2 can be complex. We define the plane of incidence as the plane including the direc-
tion of the wave propagation and the normal to the boundary, and we choose the x–z
plane to be the plane of incidence. The angle of incidence θi is defined as the angle
between the direction of propagation and the normal to the boundary (Fig. 3.2). The
refractive indexes n1 and n2 are given by n1 = [(ε1 μ1)/(ε0 μ0)]1/2 and n2 = [(ε2 μ2)/

(ε0 μ0)]1/2, and the characteristic impedance of the medium is η1 = (μ1/ε1)1/2 and
η2 = (μ2/ε2)1/2, respectively (see Section 3.2).
In Fig. 3.2 we show two cases: (a) perpendicular polarization (electric field perpen-
dicular to the plane of incidence) and (b) parallel polarization (electric field parallel
to the plane of incidence). Case (a) is also called the s polarization (senkrecht, “per-
pendicular” in German) or the TE wave (electric field is transverse to the direction
of wave propagation). Case (b) is then called the p polarization (parallel) or the TM
wave (magnetic field is transverse to the direction of wave propagation). These two
waves are independent. In fact, for a two-dimensional problem where the dielectric
constant and permeability are functions of x and z only (∂/∂y = 0), the electromagnetic
field can be separated into two independent waves: TE and TM.

PLANE-WAVE INCIDENCE ON A PLANE BOUNDARY
41
Let us consider the perpendicular polarization. We use (3.12) and note that
̂ι = ̂x sin θ𝑖+ ̂z cos θ𝑖. We then write the incident field Eyi with magnitude E0.
Ey𝑖= E0 exp(−jq𝑖z −jβ𝑖x),
(3.21)
where qi = k1 cos θi, βi = k1 sin θi, k1 = ω(μ1 ε1)1/2 = k0n1 is the wave number in
medium I, and k0 = ω(μ0 ε0)1/2 is a free-space wave number. The reflected field Eyr
also satisfies the wave equation, and therefore we write
Eyr = Rs E0 exp(+jqrz −jβrx),
(3.22)
where Rs is the reflection coefficient for perpendicular polarization (s-polarization),
qr = k1 cos θr and βr = k1 sin θr, and θr is the angle of reflection. Similarly, for the
transmitted field we have
Eyt = TsE0 exp(−jqtz −jβtx),
(3.23)
where Ts is the transmission coefficient, qt = k2 cos θt, βt = k2 sin θt, k2 = k0 n2, and
θt is the angle of transmission.
Now we apply the boundary conditions at z = 0, the continuity of the tangential
electric field Ey and the magnetic field Hx. First we apply the continuity of the
tangential electric field:
Ey𝑖+ Eyr = Eyt
atz = 0
(3.24)
This yields the following:
exp(−jβ𝑖x) + Rs exp(−jβrx) = Ts exp(−jβtx)
(3.25)
For this to hold at all x, all exponents must be the same, thus we get the phase-matching
condition:
β𝑖= βr = βt
(3.26)
From this, we obtain the law of reflection,
θ𝑖= θr,
(3.27)
and Snell’s law,
n1 sin θ𝑖= n2 sin θt.
(3.28)
With (3.26), (3.25) becomes
1 + Rs = Ts.
(3.29)

42

To apply the boundary condition for the tangential magnetic field Hx, we use
Hx =
1
jωμ
∂
∂zEy,
(3.30)
and write
Hx𝑖= −E0
Z1
exp(−jq𝑖z −jβ𝑖x),
Hxr = −RsE0
Z1
exp(+jq𝑖z −jβ𝑖x),
Hxt = −TsE0
Z2
exp(−jqtz −jβ𝑖x),
(3.31)
where Z1 = ω μ1/qi and Z2 = ω μ2/qt represent the ratio of the tangential components
Ey and Hx and are called the wave impedance. We also use Snell’s law and write
qt = (k2

and
cos θt =
[

(n1

.
(3.32)
Since the transmitted wave is propagating in the +z direction, the sign for the square
root must be chosen such that Re qt > 0 and Im qt < 0.
We now apply the continuity of the tangential magnetic field
Hx𝑖+ Hxr = Hxt
at z = 0.
(3.33)
We then get
1 −Rs
Z1

Ts =

Z2 + Z1

(3.35)
where Z1 and Z2 are as given in (3.31). Note that since exp(–jqtz) in (3.23) should
represent the wave propagating in the +z direction, if cos θt becomes complex, the
choice of the plus or minus sign in the square root must be made such that the

ELECTRIC FIELD PARALLEL TO A PLANE OF INCIDENCE:
PARALLEL POLARIZATION (p POLARIZATION)
We now consider the parallel polarization. We let E0 be the magnitude of the incident
electric field. The x component of the incident electric field is given by
Ex𝑖= E0 cos θ𝑖exp(−jq𝑖z −jβ𝑖x)
(3.37)
The reflected and the transmitted waves are
Exr = Rp E0 cos θ𝑖exp(+jq𝑖z −jβ𝑖x),
(3.38)
Ext = TpE0 cos θt exp(−jqtz −jβ𝑖x),
(3.39)
where Rp and Tp are the reflection and transmission coefficients and the law of
reflection θi = θr has already been used. As explained in Section 3.4, Snell’s law
holds here:
n1 sin θ𝑖= n2 sin θt
(3.40)
The magnetic field Hy is related to Ex by
Ex = −1

∂zHy.
(3.41)
Now we apply the boundary conditions:
Ex𝑖+ Exr = Ext
and

and obtain the following Fresnel formula:

If μ1 = μ2 = μ0, (3.43) is reduced to a more familiar form:
Rp = (1∕n2) cos θt −(1∕n1) cos θ𝑖
(1∕n2) cos θt −(1∕n1) cos θ𝑖
and
(2∕n2) cos θ𝑖

(3.45)
where
cos θt =

.
The factor cos θi/cos θt of Tp in (3.43) comes from the definition of Tp as the ratio of
the total electric field. The total transmitted and incident electric fields are Ext/cos θt
and Exi/cos θi, respectively.
If we take the tangential components Exi, Exr, and Ext, (3.43) should be identical
to (3.35). Equations (3.43) and (3.35) can be recognized as the same as the reflection
and transmission coefficients for a junction of two transmission lines. In fact, if we
take the tangential electric field as the voltage and the tangential magnetic field as the
current, we have a completely equivalent transmission-line problem (Fig. 3.3).

FRESNEL FORMULA, BREWSTER’S ANGLE,
AND TOTAL REFLECTION
Let us examine the Fresnel formula (3.35) and (3.43), when n1 and n2 are real and
positive. If medium 2 is denser than medium 1 (n1 < n2), the variations of these
coefficients as functions of the incident angle θi are as shown in Fig. 3.4a.

(3.46)
This incident angle θb is called Brewster’s angle (Fig. 3.5), and at this angle all the
incident power passes into the second medium. Note that this occurs only when the
incident field is polarized in the plane of incidence. If the wave consisting of both
parallel and perpendicular polarizations is incident on the boundary at Brewster’s
angle, the component with parallel polarization is all transmitted into the second
medium and the reflected wave consists only of the perpendicular polarization. Note
also that the Brewster angle occurs for both n1 > n2 and n1 < n2. It is also easy to prove
that at Brewster’s angle, θb + θt = π/2. This means that the electric field in the second
medium is polarized such that all the polarization vectors ̄P are pointed in the direction
of the reflected wave (Fig. 3.4). It will be shown that the far-field radiation from each
electric dipole in the direction of the dipole axis is zero, and since the reflected wave
is a sum of the radiation from all electric dipoles corresponding to the polarization
vectors ̄P, the reflection should be zero at Brewster’s angle (Sommerfeld, 1954).

Let us next examine the case when medium 2 is rarer than medium 1, n1 > n2. The
reflection coefficients are shown in Fig. 3.4b. Note that for the parallel polarization,
there is a Brewster angle. Also, note that since n1 > n2, θt > θi, and there is a critical
incident angle θi = θc at which θt becomes π/2, and the incident wave θi > θc is
totally reflected. The critical angle θc is given by
θc = sin−1 n2
n1
.
(3.47)
When the wave is totally reflected (θi > θc), there is no real power transmitted
through the boundary. However, this does not mean that there is no field in medium
2. To examine this phenomenon, consider the transmitted wave for the perpendicular
polarization.
Eyt = TsE0 exp(−jk2z cos θt −jk1x sin θ𝑖),
(3.48)
where
cos θt = (1 −sin2 θt)1∕2 =

.
When θi > θc = sin−1(n2/n1), cos θt becomes purely imaginary. In fact, as θi varies
from 0 to θc, θt varies from 0 to π/2, and when θi becomes greater than θc, θt becomes
complex (π/2 + jδ), δ > 0 (Fig. 3.6).

Note that cos θt must have a negative imaginary part, as noted in Section 3.4. The
transmitted field is then given by

This shows that the field decays exponentially in the positive z direction. This field,
(3.49), carries no real power in the +z direction. However, the reactive power given
by the imaginary part of the Poynting vector in the +z direction is not zero and
represents the stored energy. This wave is called the evanescent wave and occurs in
many situations involving total reflections. This is in contrast with the exponentially
attenuating wave in a lossy medium, which does carry real power.
Let us next consider the conservation of power across a boundary. We showed at
the end of Section 3.5 that the reflection and transmission of a wave at a boundary
is equivalent to a transmission-line junction, if the tangential electric and magnetic
fields are defined as the voltage and current, respectively. Therefore, the Poynting
vector normal to the surface is equal to 1
2 VI∗. Now we let the incident, reflected, and
transmitted Poynting vectors be ̄S𝑖, ̄Sr, and ̄St, respectively. Then we have

ACOUSTIC REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION
FROM A BOUNDARY
The fundamental equations for acoustic waves in fluid are given in Section 2.12. In
terms of the acoustic pressure p1 and the particle velocity ̄V1, we have
(∇2 + k2)p1 = 0,
̄V1 =
1
jωρ0
∇p1.
(3.58)
The boundary conditions are the continuity of p1 and (1/ρ0)(∂/∂n)p1.
For the wave incident on a boundary at z = 0 from the medium 1 with the acoustic
velocity c1 and the density ρ1 on the medium 2 with c2 and ρ2, we write the incident
pi, the reflected pr, and the transmitted waves pt.
p𝑖= A0 exp(−jq𝑖z −jβ𝑖x),
pr = RA0 exp(+jq𝑖z −jβ𝑖x),
pt = TA0 exp(−jqtz −jβ𝑖x),
(3.59)
where A0 is a constant, R and T are the reflection and transmission coefficients,
respectively, and

(3.60)
where Z1 = ρ1c1/cos θi and Z2 = ρ2c2/cos θt, and ρ1c1 and ρ2c2 are the characteristic

R = Z2 −Z1

T =

(3.61)
This is identical to electromagnetic problems. There are some differences, however.
For the electromagnetic case, μ1 and μ2 for nonmagnetic materials are equal to μ0,
and therefore the medium is characterized by the refractive index n =

ε only. For
the acoustic case, the medium is characterized by two parameters, the sound velocity
and the density (or compressibility; see Section 2.12). This is equivalent to having

different μ and ε for the electromagnetic case. Therefore, even though there is no
Brewster’s angle for electromagnetic perpendicular polarization, Brewster’s angle θb
is possible for the acoustic case and is given by setting R = 0.
sin θb =

.
(3.62)
It is clear that Brewster’s angle exists only when the right side of (3.62) is real and
its magnitude is less than unity. Thus for Brewster’s angle to exist, c1, c2, ρ1, and ρ2
must satisfy the condition that either ρ2/ρ1 < c1/c2 < 1 or ρ2/ρ1 > c1/c2 > 1.
3.9
COMPLEX WAVES
Up to this point we have discussed the reflection and transmission of a plane wave
incident on plane boundaries. We also noted that the reflection coefficient becomes
zero when the angle of incidence is equal to Brewster’s angle. Can the reflection
coefficient become infinite under certain conditions? The infinite reflection coefficient
is equivalent to having a finite field with a vanishing incident field and thus represents
a wave that is guided along the dielectric surface. This is often called the surface wave
or the trapped surface wave. Important applications of this wave type include guided
waves on optical fibers and thin films, microwaves on Goubau lines, and artificial
dielectric, and thin dielectric coatings on metal surfaces.
In studying the surface-wave mode and other guided waves, it is important first
to recognize various wave types and their mathematical representations. The general
wave types are usually called complex waves, and the clear understanding of their
characteristics is important in the study of surface waves, leaky waves, Zenneck
waves, and many other wave types.
To clarify the relationships among various wave types, it is instructive to examine
all possible waves propagating along a plane boundary and their physical significance.
Let us examine a wave u(x, z) propagating in the z direction in free space. We consider
the two-dimensional problem ∂/∂y = 0 and assume that the dielectric or other guiding
structure is located below x = 0 and that free space extends to infinity in the +x
direction. This field u(x, z) satisfies a scalar wave equation.
(
∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂z2 + k2
)
u(x, z) = 0.
(3.63)
We write a solution in the following form:
u(x, z) = e−jpx−jβz
(3.64)
Substituting this into (3.63), we get the following condition:
p2 + β2 = k2
(3.65)

52
WAVES IN INHOMOGENEOUS AND LAYERED MEDIA
In general, p and β can be complex and thus we let
p = pr −jαt
and
β = βr −jα.
(3.66)
Substituting (3.66) into (3.65) and equating the real and imaginary parts of both sides,
we get
p2
r −α2
t + β2
r −α2 = k2,
(3.67)
prαr + βrα = 0.
(3.68)
Using (3.68), we can first show that the constant-amplitude and constant-phase planes
are perpendicular to each other. To prove this, we write
u(x, z) = e−j(prx+βrz)−(αtx+αz) = e−j̄kr⋅̄r−̄α⋅̄r
(3.69)
The constant-phase plane is given by
̄kr ⋅̄r = constant,
̄kr = pr̂x + βr̂z,
̂r = x̂x + ẑz,
(3.70)
and the constant-amplitude plane by
̄α ⋅̄r = constant,
̄α = αt̂x + α̂z.
(3.71)
Thus the constant-phase plane is perpendicular to ̄kr and the constant-amplitude plane
is perpendicular to ̄α. But according to (3.68), ̄kr is perpendicular to ̄α
̄kr ⋅̄α = prαt + βrα = 0,
(3.72)
and therefore the constant-amplitude plane is perpendicular to the constant-phase
plane (Fig. 3.8).

Next, we consider the behavior of the wave as x →+ ∞. We take the wave whose
phase progression along the surface is in the +z direction (βr > 0) and then consider
the magnitude of the wave in the transverse (x) direction, which is given by
|e−jpx| = e−α𝑖x.
(3.73)
From this we note that if αt > 0, the wave attenuates exponentially in the +x direction
and is called the proper wave. If αt < 0, the wave has the amplitude increasing
exponentially in the +x direction and is called the improper wave. It is obvious that
depending on the signs of βr, α, pr, and αt, a variety of wave types can result.
Let us start with the following combinations of p and β shown in Table 3.1. In
terms of ̄kr = pr̂x + βr̂z and ̄α = αt̂x + α̂z, they are pictured in Fig. 3.9. In terms of the
complex p = pr + jpi and β = βr + jβi planes, they are shown in Fig. 3.10. Note that for
a given β, there can be two values of p = ±(k2 – β2)1/2. For example, two waves at D
and H have the same β but different p. D is the Zenneck wave and H is the leaky wave.
Those waves in the upper half-plane of the complex p plane are the improper waves,
whereas those in the lower half are the proper waves (see Section 3.12 for Zenneck

waves are interpreted as a portion of the complete spectrum representation of a wave.
In this chapter, we concentrate on trapped surface waves and leaky waves.
3.10
TRAPPED SURFACE WAVE (SLOW WAVE) AND LEAKY WAVE
If a wave propagates along a surface with the phase velocity lower than the veloc-
ity of light, the wave can be trapped near the surface and can propagate without
attenuation. This characteristic is useful for guiding waves over a long distance.
Examples are optical communication through optical fiber, microwave transmission
through Goubau wire, and surface waves on a dielectric coating. Other examples are
waves along Yagi antennas and slow waves along helical structures in traveling-wave
tubes.
Let us assume that a wave propagates along a surface without attenuation. If the
phase velocity of this wave is slow, β = βr = ω/vp > k. Thus, from (3.65), we get
p2 = k2 −β2
r < 0,
and therefore, p must be purely imaginary. Writing p = –jαt, the wave is expressed by
u(x, z) = e−αtx−jβrz,
(3.74)
where αt =
√
β2
r −k2. Obviously, in this case, ̄kr is directed in the z direction and ̄α
in the x direction (Fig. 3.11).

FIGURE 3.11
Trapped surface waves.
We note that the slower the wave, the greater the value of β, and therefore, the
greater the value of αt. Because of the attenuation due to αt in the +x direction, the
wave is mostly concentrated near the surface and the total power is finite:
∫
∞
0
|wu(x, y)|2 dx = finite.
(3.75)
Thus the wave is said to be trapped near the surface. The trapped surface wave
propagates the finite amount of power along the surface without attenuation, and
it decays exponentially in the transverse +x direction. In this chapter, we examine
several slow-wave structures that support the trapped surface wave.
Let us consider a fast wave propagating along the surface, βr = ω/vp < k. In this
case, in general, the wave must attenuate in the +z direction, α > 0, and according to
(3.68), prαt must be negative. If we consider the outgoing wave in the +x direction, pr
is positive, and therefore, αt must be negative. Now αt < 0 represents the wave whose
amplitude increases exponentially in the +x direction, and thus this is the improper
wave. Note that the amplitude decays in the z direction (A1 > A2 > A3 > A4), but in
the x direction at a given z, the amplitude increases exponentially (Fig. 3.12). This
wave is called a leaky wave, as the energy is constantly leaked out from the surface.

Leaky waveguides.
Since the leaky wave is an improper wave, it cannot exist by itself, but it can
exist within a portion of a space. A typical example is the radiation from a narrow
slit cut along a waveguide. The energy leaks out through this slit, and thus the
wave attenuates in the z direction. But the wave farther from the surface has greater
amplitude because it is originated at the point on the waveguide where the amplitude
is greater. The angle θc is approximately given by the propagation constant βz for the
waveguide (Fig. 3.13).
βz = k sin θc.
Note that the leaky wave exists only in a portion of the space, and thus in the transverse
(x) direction the amplitude increases up to a point and then decreases. More rigorous
analysis is necessary to analyze this problem completely and will be done later in
terms of a Fourier transform technique (see Section 14.1).
Another important example is the coupling of an optical beam into a thin film as
shown in Fig. 3.14. A slow wave propagates along a thin film. A prism is placed close
to the thin film, and the wave in the prism becomes a leaky wave extracting the power
from the surface wave. The leaky wave is then taken out from the prism at Brewster’s
angle. This process can be reversed and a beam can enter into a prism in the opposite
direction and the power can be converted into a surface wave.

3.11
SURFACE WAVES ALONG A DIELECTRIC SLAB
A dielectric slab can support a trapped surface wave. This occurs in a variety of
situations, such as optical beam propagation along a thin film and optical fibers. Also,
radar cross sections of spacecraft and rockets are severely affected by the existence of
surface waves on the surface coated with thin dielectric materials. Furthermore, the
study of this dielectric slab requires a basic mathematical technique that is common
to other wave propagation problems for planar stratified media, such as the wave
propagation along the earth–ionosphere waveguide. In this section, we consider the
characteristics of trapped surface-wave modes on a dielectric slab.
Let us consider a wave propagating in the z direction along a dielectric slab of
thickness d placed on a perfectly conducting plane (Fig. 3.15). Since this is a two-
dimensional problem with ∂/∂y = 0, there are two independent modes. One consists
of Hy, Ex, and Ez and since the magnetic field Hy is transverse to the direction of
propagation (the z direction), we may call them TM (transverse magnetic) modes. The
other consists of Ey, Hx, and Hz and may be called TE (transverse electric) modes.
The TM modes can be derived from Hy, which satisfies the wave equation
(
∂2

∂z2 + k2
)
Hy = 0,
(3.76)
and Ex and Ez are given in terms of Hy:
Ex = j 1

Ez = −j 1

WAVES IN INHOMOGENEOUS AND LAYERED MEDIA
Let us first consider the TM mode. This mode can easily be excited by a horn or
a waveguide. We solve (3.76) in free space and in the dielectric slab.
Hy0 = Ae−jp0x−jβz
for
x > d (free space),
(3.80)
Hy1 = Be−jpx −jβz + Ce+jpx−jβz
for
d > x > 0
(in dielectric),
(3.81)
where
p2
0 + β2 = k2
0
and
p2 + β2 = k2
1.
We note that the propagation constant β along the surface must be the same for both
free space and dielectric to ensure the same phase progression along the surface.
This is necessary to satisfy the boundary condition. We also note that (3.80) has only
one term because this region extends to infinity and only the outgoing wave exists.
Equation (3.81), on the other hand, consists of two terms representing the waves
propagating in the +x and the –x direction.
Now the boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = d are applied. At x = 0, we have
Ez1 = −j 1
ωε1
∂
∂xHy1 = 0,
(3.82)
and at x = d, Ez and Hy must be continuous.
Ez0 = Ez1
and
Hy0 = Hy1,
(3.83)
where
Ez0 = −j 1
ωε0

and
Ez1 = −j 1

Equations (3.82) and (3.83) may be written as
−B + C = 0,
Be−jpd + Cejpd = Aejp0d,
p

(Be−jpd −Cejpd) = p0

From these, we eliminate A, B, and C and obtain the transcendental equation to
determine the propagation constant β.

(3.84)
Once this equation is solved for p, the propagation constant β is given by β =
(k2

problem and is called the eigenvalue. Equation (3.84) is the eigenvalue equation.

Equations (3.84) and (3.85) should give the propagation constant and the field con-
figurations for the TM mode.
3.11.1
Slow-Wave Solution for the TM Mode
Let us consider the most important case of a trapped surface-wave propagation. As
noted in Section 3.10, we look for a solution of the form
Hy0 = Ae−αtx−jβz,
(3.86)
with
β > k0
and
p0 = −jαt.
In this case, β2 −α2
t = k2
0 and β2 −p2 = k2
1 and thus, eliminating β from these two,
we get
α2
t = (k2
1−= k2
0) −p2.
(3.87)
Thus the eigenvalue equation (3.84) becomes, for αt > 0,
ε0
ε1
X tan X =
√
V2 −X2,
(3.88)
where X = pd and V2 = (k2

0)d2. If the dielectric constant ε of the material is
greater than ε0, V2 is real and positive. If we plot the left side and the right side of
(3.88) as functions of X, we get a curve Yl for the left side and a circle Yr for the
right side. The solution is obtained at the intersection of Yr and Yl (Fig. 3.16). Note
that when 0 < V < π, there is only one solution. Similarly, when (N – 1)π < V < N π,
there are N different modes. Therefore, there exist N trapped surface-wave modes if
the thickness of the slab d is given by
N −1
2(εr −1)1∕2 < d

2(εr −1)1∕2 ,

(3.89)
and in particular, there exists only one mode if
0 < d
λ0

2(εr −1)1∕2 .
(3.90)

60
WAVES IN INHOMOGENEOUS AND LAYERED MEDIA
The parameter V = k0d(n2
1 −1)1∕2 determines the number of modes and is called
the normalized frequency. The total number of propagating modes N is given by the
mode volume formula:
(N −1)π < V < Nπ
(3.91)
Once we find X = pd from (3.88), the propagation constant β is obtained by β2 =
k2
1 −p2. As is seen for V = V2 (Fig. 3.16), there are also some solutions for αt < 0.
This is called untrapped surface wave. When this structure is excited by a source,
this wave has some influence over the total field. In practice, however, this untrapped
surface wave contributes very little to the total field and is insignificant.
The propagation constant β can be found from the value of X in (3.88) using
β2 = k2
1 −p2. A general shape of k0–β diagram may be seen by examining a few
important points (Fig. 3.17). For example, as k0 →0, the curve approaches k0 = β,
and as k0 →∞, the curve approaches k1 = β. Also, note that at each cutoff frequency
(kc), the curve is tangent to k0 = β. It is clear then that β is always between k0 and
k1, and thus the phase velocity is always faster than that of a plane wave in dielectric
1∕√μ0ε1, but slower than that in free space 1∕√μ0ε0. At the cutoff frequency kc, V =
X = Nπ in (3.88) and αt becomes zero. This means that at the cutoff, the magnitude of
the wave outside the slab becomes uniform, extending to infinity instead of decaying
exponentially.

are perpendicular to each other and have the same configuration. The ratio of these
two is the wave impedance Ze = (β/k)η. Also, the field has sinusoidal distribution (cos
px) inside dielectric, but it has exponential behavior (e−αtx) in free space (Fig. 3.18).
Next, let us examine the impedance looking down on the surface of the dielectric
slab. Noting that the Poynting vector Eẑz × H∗
y ̂y is pointed into the dielectric, the
impedance is given by

This is purely inductive. It is clear that the surface supporting the trapped surface
wave must be purely reactive. The TM mode requires a purely inductive surface,
whereas the TE mode requires a purely capacitive surface.

(3.103)
Here (1 + εr)1/2 is chosen such that its imaginary part is negative. These are shown
in Fig. 3.22. β and p0 may be compared with those shown in Fig. 3.10. The propaga-
tion constant β was obtained by Zenneck to explain the propagation characteristics
of radio waves over the earth. The excitation of such a wave by a dipole source
was investigated by Sommerfeld, and we discuss this historical Sommerfeld dipole
problem in Chapter 15.

Next we consider the case when εr is real and negative. Ionized gas, called plasma,
has this dielectric constant when the operating frequency is below plasma frequency
and the loss is negligible. We let εr = –|ε| and note that if |ε| > 1, the propagation
constant is real, p0 = –jα0, and p = –j α. This is a trapped surface wave propagating
along the boundary.
Metal at optical frequencies can have a dielectric constant with a negative real
part. For example, at λ = 0.6 μm, silver has εr = –17.2 – j0.498. In this case the wave
is not trapped, but the wave propagating along the surface exhibits characteristics
similar to surface waves (Fig. 3.23). This is called the plasmon, and it has significant
effects on the optical scattering characteristics of metal surfaces.
Zenneck waves and plasmons cannot exist by themselves, but when the surface is
illuminated by a localized source and the field is expressed in a Fourier transform,

these waves appear as poles in the complex Fourier transform plane and the locations
of the poles have significant effects on the total field. Above, we considered only TM
waves. It can be shown, however, that these poles do not exist for TE waves.
3.13
WAVES IN INHOMOGENEOUS MEDIA
Up to this point we have discussed waves in homogeneous media separated by
plane boundaries. Even though they represent a great many problems, there are many
practical problems where the medium should be represented by a continuous function
of position. For example, the ionosphere can be approximated by a medium with a
sharply bounded lower edge at VLF (very low frequency, 1–30 KHz), but for higher
frequencies, the variation of the electron density over a wavelength is gradual and
must be represented by a continuous function of height. The medium whose dielectric
constant ε or permeability μ is a function of position is called the inhomogeneous
medium.
In general, the characteristics of wave propagation and scattering in an inhomo-
geneous medium cannot be described in a simple form. However, relatively simple
descriptions of the field are possible for two extreme cases: low-frequency and high-
frequency fields. The high-frequency approximation is useful whenever the variation
of the refractive index of the medium is negligibly small over the distance of a wave-
length. This applies to ultrasound propagation in biological media, wave propagation
in the ionosphere, microwaves and optical waves in large dielectric bodies, and sound
propagation in ocean water. In contrast to this high-frequency approximation, the low-
frequency approximation is applicable whenever the sizes of a dielectric body are
much smaller than a wavelength. Examples are microwave radiation in a biological
medium and scattering from small particles in the ocean, atmosphere, and biological
media. In the following sections, we discuss the high-frequency approximation.
Let us consider a plane wave incident upon a medium whose dielectric constant
is a function of height z. We choose the x axis so that the plane of incidence is in
the x–z plane (Fig. 3.24). This is a two-dimensional problem (∂/∂y = 0), and thus
there are two independent waves, TE (electric field is transverse to the z axis) and
TM (magnetic field is transverse to the z axis). For TE (perpendicular polarization),
we combine Maxwell’s equations
∇× ̄E = −jωμ ̄H,
∇× ̄H = jωε(z) ̄E,
(3.104)
and get
∇× ∇× ̄E = ∇(∇⋅̄E) −∇2 ̄E = k2
0n2(z) ̄E.
Noting that ∇⋅̄E = (∂∕∂y)Ey = 0, we get
[

∂x2 + ∂2
∂z2 + k2
0n2(z)
]
Ey = 0.

Note that (3.105) and (3.109) have the same mathematical form. Thus the study
of the equation for the TE wave may be easily extended to that of the TM wave with
changes from n to N.
Let us now consider the TE plane wave obliquely incident upon the medium
(Fig. 3.24). We write
Ey(x, z) = u(z)e−jβ𝑖x,
(3.110)

68
WAVES IN INHOMOGENEOUS AND LAYERED MEDIA
where βi = k0 sin θi. Then (3.105) becomes
[
d2
dz2 + q2(z)
]
u(z) = 0,
(3.111)
where q2(z) = k2
0[n2(z) −sin2 θ𝑖]. Similarly, for the TM wave, we let
U(x, z) = u(z)e−jβ𝑖x.
(3.112)
We get the same equation, (3.111), with
q2(z) = k2
0[N2(z) −sin2 θ𝑖].
(3.113)
In Section 3.14 we discuss the WKB solution of (3.111).
3.14
WKB METHOD
In general, the exact solution of (3.111) may be obtained only for a few special
functions q(z). Here we consider an approximate solution of (3.111) called the WKB
solution, named after Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin. Sometimes, this is also called
the WKBJ method, adding Jeffreys.
The WKB approximation can be thought of as the first term of an asymptotic
expansion. There are two ways of obtaining the asymptotic series. One is to expand
the phase of u(z) in a series
u(z) = exp
(
∑
n
ψn
)
,
(3.114)
and the other is to expand the field u(z) in a series
u(z) =
∑
n
un(z).
(3.115)
The first approach, (3.114), is convenient when the total phase is important, whereas
the approach (3.115) is convenient for identifying various waves propagating in the
medium. In either case the first term gives the identical WKB solution.
Let us consider (3.111). Noting that q is proportional to the wave number k0, we
may write q(z) = k0ne(z) and ne(z) as the equivalent refractive index.
Let us use (3.114), which is called the phase integral approach,
u(z) = eψ(z)
and
ψ(z) = ∫
z
ϕ(z)dz.
(3.116)

WKB METHOD
69
Then substituting this into (3.111) we have
dϕ
dz + ϕ2 + k2
0n2
e = 0.
(3.117)
Note that (3.117) is a first-order nonlinear differential equation of the Riccati type.
In general, it is always possible to transform a second-order linear differential
equation,
[
p0(z) d2
dz2 + P1(z) d
dz + p2(z)
]
u(z) = 0,
(3.118)
into a first-order nonlinear differential equation of the Riccati type by using the
transformation
u(z) = eψ(z) = e∫Q(z)ϕ(z)dz.
(3.119)
The resulting Riccati equation is
dϕ
dz + P(z)ϕ + Q(z)ϕ2 = R(z),
(3.120)
where
P(z) = P1

and
R(z) = −P2
P0Q.
For our problem (3.111), P0 = 1, P1 = 0, P2 = q2, and Q = 1.
Let us examine (3.117). We seek an expansion of ϕ in inverse powers of k. We
write
ϕ = ϕ0k0 + ϕ1 + ϕ2
k0
+ ϕ3
k2
0
+ ⋯.
(3.121)
The first term of (3.121) is proportional to k0, as is clear from (3.117). Substituting
(3.121) into (3.117) and expanding (3.117) in inverse powers of k0, we get

(3.122)

70
WAVES IN INHOMOGENEOUS AND LAYERED MEDIA
Equating the coefficients of each power of k0 to zero, we get an infinite number of
equations. The first three are
ϕ2
0 + n2
e = 0,
2ϕ0ϕ1 + ϕ′
0 = 0,
ϕ2
12ϕ0ϕ2 + ϕ′
1 = 0.
(3.123)
The first equation of (3.123) gives
ϕ0 = ±jne.
(3.124)
From the second equation, we have
ϕ1 = −
ϕ′
0
2ϕ0
.
(3.125)
Therefore, the solution u(z) is
u(z) = e∫ϕdz
= e∫(ϕ0k0+ϕ1+⋯)dz
= exp(±j ∫k0nedz + ∫ϕ1dz + ⋯).
(3.126)
From (3.125), we get
∫ϕ1dz = −∫
ϕ′

2ϕ0
dz = −1
2 ln ϕ0,
and thus if we continue to the terms ϕ0 and ϕ1, we get
u(z) =

√
ϕ0
exp(±j ∫k0nedz).
The general solution to (3.111) is, therefore,
u(z) =
1
q1∕2 (Ae−j ∫qdz + Be+j ∫qdz),
(3.127)
where A and B are arbitrary constants and q = k0ne. The derivative du/dz, consistent
with the approximation above, is
du(z)
dz
= −jq1∕2(Ae−j ∫qdz −Be+j ∫qdz).
(3.128)
www.ebook3000.com

WKB METHOD
71
Here since we kept only the terms with q−1/2 in (3.127), we keep only the terms with
q1/2 in (3.128). The term with q−3/2 should not be kept as it is comparable to the term
arising from ϕ2. Equations (3.127) and (3.128) constitute the WKB solution to the
original equation (3.111).
The WKB solution (3.127) consists of the wave u1 traveling in the +z direction
and the wave u2 traveling in the –z direction.
u1 =
1
q1∕2 e−j ∫qdz
and
u2 =
1
q1∕2 e+j ∫qdz.
(3.129)
The Wronskian of u1 and u2 is then given by (see Section 5.5)
Δ = u1u′
2 −u2u′
1 = 2j.
(3.130)
Let us examine the condition for the validity of the WKB solution. If we substitute
u1 in (3.129) into the original equation (3.111), we get
(
d2
dz2 + q2
)
u1 = f ≠0.
Therefore, the range of validity of the WKB solution is
|f| ≪|q2u1|.

(3.132)
It is clear that the medium must be slowly varying, but because of k2
0, it is a better
approximation for higher frequencies. However, whenever q = 0 (or ne = 0), the
WKB solution is not valid.
Let us next consider the physical meaning of the WKB solution. The total phase
∫q dz is the integral of the wave number q along the path. The amplitude q−1/2 is
such that the total power flux in a lossless medium is kept constant. For a scalar field
u(̄r), the real power flux density ̄F(̄r) is given by (Eq. 2.134)
̄F(̄r) = Im[u∇u∗].
(3.133)
For our problem, the wave traveling in the +z direction is u(z) = Aq−1/2 exp(–j ∫
q dz), and therefore, for a lossless medium (q is real), the power flux is kept constant.
̄F(z) = |A|2̂z = constant.
(3.134)

72
WAVES IN INHOMOGENEOUS AND LAYERED MEDIA
The WKB solution is identical to the geometric optics approximation, in which the
phase is given by an eikonal equation and the amplitude is obtained so as to conserve
power. The WKB solution is similar to the Rytov solution (see Appendix 16.B).
3.15
BREMMER SERIES
The WKB solution is the first term of the high-frequency series representation of a
wave. It is applicable to the wave in a slowly varying inhomogeneous medium at
high frequencies. The next term is usually difficult to obtain, but it is important to
examine the rest of the series in order to determine the correction to the WKB method
and to establish the convergence of the series. The Bremmer series provides such a
representation (Wait, 1962).
Let us consider a series representation of a field u(z):
u(z) =
∑
n
un(z).
(3.135)
This is convenient because each term can be identified with the actual wave reflected
by the inhomogeneities. This is done by Bremmer in the following manner.
We seek a solution to the differential equation
(
d2
dz2 + q2
)
u(z) = 0,
(3.136)
in a form of the WKB solution, except that we allow A and B in (3.127) to be a
function of z and try to find A(z) and B(z) to satisfy the differential equation. Thus we
write
u(z) =
1
q1∕2 [A(z)e−j ∫qdz + B(z)e+j ∫qdz].
(3.137)
Furthermore, we impose the condition between A(z) and B(z), such that the derivative
du/dz has the same form as (3.128):
du(z)
dz
= −jq1∕2[A(z)e−j ∫qdz −B(z)e+j ∫qdz].
(3.138)

(3.144)
These two equations constitute the coupling between two waves A(z) and B(z). Let us
first recognize that these couplings depend on how the medium varies. If the medium
is a slowly varying function, then q′/q, and therefore the coupling, is small. If the
coupling is small, we may write

(3.146)

A = A0 + εA1 + ε2A2 + ⋯,
B = B0 + εB1 + ε2B2 + ⋯.
(3.147)

(3.149)
The limit of integration in (3.149) is chosen to represent the physical picture as

u(z) =
1
q1∕2 [(A0 + εA1 + ε2A2 + ⋯)e−j ∫qdz + (B0 + εB1 + ε2B2 + ⋯)e+j ∫qdz]

where
u0+ = A0

WKB SOLUTION FOR THE TURNING POINT
It is clear that the WKB solution breaks down in the neighborhood of z = z0, where
q(z0) = 0.
(3.155)
Consider the profile of q(z) shown in Fig. 3.26. The wave propagating in the +z
direction cannot propagate beyond the point z0, and thus the wave must be reflected
back. This point z0 is called the turning point.
Let us consider the three regions approximately divided at z1 and z2, as shown in
Fig. 3.26. In region I, the WKB solution is applicable, and thus the incident wave can
be written as
u𝑖(z) = A0
q1∕2 e−j ∫z
0 qdz,
(3.156)
where A0/q(0)1/2 is the amplitude at z = 0.
The reflected wave in region I can also be written in the WKB form. It is shown
in Appendix 3.A, that the WKB reflected wave is given by
ur(z) = A0
q1∕2 e−j ∫z0
0 q(z)dz+j ∫z
z0 q(z)dz+j(π∕2).
(3.157)
Note that the phase of the reflected wave is the integral of q(z) from 0 to z0, and
then from z0 back to z with the additional phase jump of π/2. Thus the reflected
wave ur behaves as if the WKB solution is applicable to z0 and back, except for the
phase jump. The WKB solution is, of course, not applicable near z0, as shown in

The WKB method can conveniently deal with the propagation constant of the guided-
wave modes in an inhomogeneous slab. This approach is useful for thin-film, graded-
index optical fibers (GRIN), and guided acoustic waves in the ocean.
Consider a dielectric slab whose refractive index n (or relative dielectric constant
εr) is a function of z.
εr(z) = n2(z).
(3.159)
The wave U(x, z) is propagating in the x direction and we wish to find the propagation
constant β in the x direction. The field U(x, z) satisfies

3.18
MEDIUM WITH PRESCRIBED PROFILE
It is often possible to approximate the profile of the medium n(z) by using a particular
functional form such that the resulting equation has a well-known exact solution.
Here we discuss one such example.
There are a great number of differential equations, which may be converted into
Bessel’s differential equation (Jahnke et al., 1960, p. 156). For example,
W′′ +
(
β2 −4v2 −1

)
W = 0,
(3.169)
has a solution
W =
√
zZv(βz),
where Zv is a Bessel function. We may convert (3.111) into the form above if the
medium profile is given by
n2 = a2 −
b2
(z + z0)2 ,
(3.170)
where a, b, and z0 are constants to be chosen arbitrarily. Then (3.111) becomes

u(z) = 0.
(3.171)
Comparing (3.171) with (3.169), we get the solution
u(z) = (z + z0)1∕2Zv[β(z + z0)],
(3.172)
where v =

a2 −sin2 θ𝑖.
The choice of the Bessel function Z must be made to satisfy the boundary con-
ditions. For example, if the medium extends to z →∞, then to satisfy the radiation
condition as z →∞, we must have (see 4.80)
Zv = H(2)
v [β(z + z0)].

CHAPTER 4
WAVEGUIDES AND CAVITIES
In Chapter 3 we discussed wave propagation along layered media. In this chapter,
we concentrate on hollow waveguides, dielectric waveguides, and cavities commonly
used in microwave, millimeter wave, and optical fibers. In discussing these problems,
we present basic formulations and solutions in terms of special functions. Waveguide
problems are treated extensively in Montgomery et al. (1948) and Marcuvitz (1951);
dielectric waveguides are discussed in Marcuse (1982). For special functions, see
Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (1965), Jahnke et al. (1960), Abramowitz and Stegun (1964),
and Magnus and Oberhettinger (1949).
4.1
UNIFORM ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVEGUIDES
We start with a general expression for the electromagnetic field in the source-free
region in terms of the electric Hertz vector ̄π and the magnetic Hertz vector ̄πm shown
in Sections 2.7 and 2.9.
̄E = ∇× ∇× ̄π −jωμ∇× ̄πm,
̄H = jωε∇× ̄π + ∇× ∇× ̄πm.
(4.1)
It has been shown (Stratton, 1941, p. 392) that a completely general solution to
Maxwell’s equations can be given by (4.1) when ̄π and ̄πm are pointed in a constant
direction ̂a.
̄π = π(x, y, z)̂a,
̄πm = πm(x, y, z)̂a.
(4.2)
As noted in Sections 2.7 and 2.9, ̄π and ̄πm satisfy the scalar wave equation.

WAVEGUIDES AND CAVITIES
z
FIGURE 4.1
Uniform waveguide.
For a waveguide whose cross section is uniform along the z direction (Fig. 4.1),
it is convenient to choose ̄π = πẑz. It will be shown that the fields generated by
̄π = πz ̂z do not have Hz, the z component of the magnetic field, and this is called the
transverse magnetic (TM) mode. It is also called the E mode since Ez, the z component
of the electric field, is proportional to πz, which generates this mode. Similarly,
the field generated by ̄πm = πmẑz does not have Ez and is called the transverse
electric (TE) mode. It is also called the H mode. We now show that the TM and TE
modes correspond to the solutions to Dirichlet’s and Neumann’s eigenvalue problems,
respectively.
4.2
TM MODES OR E MODES
The TM modes are generated by ̄π = πẑz, which satisfies the scalar wave equation:
(∇2 + k2)πz = 0
(4.3)
where k is the wave number. If the waveguide is hollow, it is given in terms of the
velocity of light c and wavelength λ0 in a vacuum,
k = k0 = ω
c = 2π
λ0
.
(4.4)
If the waveguide is filled with a material with an index of refraction n, k is given by
k = k0n = ω
c n = 2π
λ0
n.
(4.5)
All field components are then given in terms of πz,
̄E = ∇(∇⋅̄π) + k2̄π = ∇∂πz
∂z + k2̄π,

̄H = jωε∇× ̄π = jωε
(
̂z ∂

)
× ̄π = jωε(∇tπz × ̂z),
(4.7)
where ∇t is a “del” operator in the transverse plane,
∇t = ̂x ∂
∂x + ̂y ∂
∂y.
(4.8)
Also note that ̄H is transverse to the z direction.

TE MODES OR H MODES
87
Let us consider the propagation constant β of a wave propagating in the z direction.
The Hertz vector is given by
πz (x, y, z) = ϕ (x, y) e−jβz
(4.9)
Substituting this into (4.3), we get
(∇2
t + k2
c
) ϕ(x, y) = 0,
β2 = k2 −k2
c.
(4.10)
For a given waveguide, kc is a constant and depends only on the geometry of the
guide. This constant kc is called the cutoff wave number. Once kc is known, the
propagation constant β for a given frequency is determined from (4.10).
The field components are then given by (4.6) and (4.7) using (4.9),
Ez = k2
cϕ(x, y)e−jβz,
̄Et = −jβ∇tϕ(x, y)e−jβz,
Hz = 0,
̄Ht = ̂z × ̄Et
Ze
= −jωε̂z × Δtϕ(x, y)e−jβz,
(4.11)
where Ze = β/ωε.
The significance of the formulation above is that the waveguide problem is now
reduced to solving a scalar wave equation (4.10) for a scalar function ϕ(x, y) over
the waveguide cross section. Also, we note from (4.11) that in the cross section the
electric and magnetic field distributions have the same form except that the magnetic
field is rotated by 90◦from the electric field and the ratio of the electric field to the
magnetic field is Ze. The quantity Ze has the dimension of impedance and is called
the wave impedance.
4.3
TE MODES OR H MODES
The dual of the TM modes are the TE (transverse electric) modes or H modes. This
can be derived from the magnetic Hertz vector πm = πmẑz and πmz satisfies the wave
equation
(∇2 + k2)πmz = 0.
(4.12)
For a wave propagating in the z direction with propagation constant β, we write
πmz = ψ (x, y) e−jβz.
(4.13)
We then get the scalar wave equation for ψ(x, y)
(∇2
t + k2
c
) ψ(x, y) = 0.
(4.14)

88
WAVEGUIDES AND CAVITIES
The propagation constant β at a given frequency is obtained once the cutoff wave
number kc is known,
β2 = k2 −k2
c.
(4.15)
The field components are given in the following form, similar to (4.11):
Hz = k2
cψ(x, y)e−jβz,
̄H = −jβ∇tψ(x, y)e−jβz,
Ez = 0,
̄Et = Zh( ̄Ht × ̂z) = jωμ̂z × ∇tψ(x, y)e−jβz,
(4.16)
where Zh is the wave impedance given by
Zh = ωμ
β .
Note that if the waveguide is empty, k = k0, but if the waveguide is filled with a
material with an index of refraction n, k = k0 n.
The boundary condition for a perfectly conducting wall is that the tangential
electric field must be zero. For TM modes, this means that
Ez = 0
and
̄Et × ̂n = 0,
(4.17)
where ̂n is the unit vector normal to the boundary (Fig. 4.2). From (4.11), the first
condition requires that either kc = 0 or ϕ(x, y) = 0 on the wall. If kc = 0, Ez as well
as Hz is identically zero at all points in the guide, and therefore this is a TEM mode
(transverse electromagnetic mode). It will be shown later that TEM modes cannot
exist inside a waveguide with a single wall. Therefore, for TM modes, kc ≠0 and
ϕ (x, y) = 0
on the wall.
(4.18)
If (4.18) is satisfied, we can show that ̄Et × ̂n is also zero on the wall. To show this,
write ̄Et = ( ̄Et ⋅̂n)̂n + ( ̄Et ⋅̂t)̂t, where ̂t is the unit vector tangential to the wall and ̂n

is the unit vector normal to the wall (Fig. 4.2). Then ̄Et × ̂n = −( ̄Et ⋅̂t)̂z, but ( ̄Et ⋅̂t) is
equal to –jβ(∂)/(∂t)ϕ(x, y)e–jβz from (4.11), where ∂/∂t is the derivative in the direction
of ̂t. If ϕ(x, y) = 0 on the wall, then ∂/(∂t)ϕ is also zero, and thus ̄Et × ̂n = 0 on the
wall.
For TE modes, the boundary condition is ̄Et × ̂n = 0. From (4.16), this condition
can be shown to be equivalent to
∂ψ
∂n = 0
on the wall.
(4.19)
These two boundary conditions, (4.18) and (4.19), are called Dirichlet’s and
Neumann’s conditions, respectively, and boundary value problems with these bound-
ary conditions are often encountered in many branches of science and engineering.
4.4
EIGENFUNCTIONS AND EIGENVALUES
As shown in (4.10), for TM modes, the problem is reduced to that of finding the
function ϕ(x, y) and the constant kc satisfying the following equation:
(∇2
t + k2
c
) ϕ(x, y) = 0,
over the cross section of the guide and the boundary condition
ϕ (x, y) = 0
on the boundary.
(4.20)
Similarly, for TE modes, we have, from (4.14),
(∇2
t + k2
c
) ψ(x, y) = 0,
∂ψ
∂n = 0
on the boundary.
(4.21)
The function ϕ(x, y) or ψ(x, y) satisfying (4.20) or (4.21) is called the eigenfunction
and kc is called the eigenvalue. Therefore, the problem of solving for electromagnetic
wave propagation in a uniform guide with a perfectly conducting wall is reduced
to the problem of finding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the two-dimensional
Dirichlet’s or Neumann’s problems (4.20) or (4.21), and once kc is obtained, the
propagation constant β is given by
β = (k2 −k2
c
)1∕2.
(4.22)
In general, to satisfy (4.20) or (4.21), the eigenvalue kc cannot be an arbi-
trary number, and it can take only specific values. There is an infinite number of

discrete eigenvalues. As an example, consider a rectangular guide with sides a and b
(Fig. 4.3). The eigenfunction ϕ(x, y) satisfies the wave equation:
(
∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2 + k2
c
)
ϕ(x, y) = 0.
(4.23)
The boundary conditions are
ϕ (x, y) = 0
at x = 0 and a and at y = 0 and b.
(4.24)
Equations (4.23) and (4.24) can be solved by assuming that ϕ(x, y) is a product of
a function X(x) of x only and a function Y(y) of y only. This technique is called the
method of separation of variables and is possible only when the boundary coincides
with the coordinate system. Let us write
ϕ (x, y) = X (x) Y (y) .
(4.25)
Substituting this into (4.23) and multiplying the resulting equation by [X(x)Y(y)]–1,
we get
X′′
X + Y′′
Y + k2
c = 0,
(4.26)
where the double prime means the second derivative. Since the first term depends
only on x and the second term depends only on y, (4.26) can be satisfied for arbitrary
x and y only when the first term and the second term, respectively, are constant and
the constants are chosen such that the sum of the constants and k2
c equals zero. Let
these two constants be −k2
x and −k2
y. Then we have

where k2

c. Since each of (4.27) is a second-order differential equation, X(x)
is given by a linear combination of two independent solutions,
X (x) = A sin kxx + B cos kxx,
(4.28)
where A and B are constant. Now we apply the boundary condition that X(0) =
X(a) = 0. This gives B = 0 and sin kxa = 0. From this we get
kx = mπ

m = 1, 2, 3, … , ∞.

Let us choose A such that X(x) satisfies the following normalization condition:

X(x)2dx = 1,
(4.30)
yielding A = (2/a)1/2.
Similarly, the normalized Y(y) is given by
Y(y) =

sin kyy,
(4.31)
where
ky = nπ
b ,
n = 1, 2, 3, … , ∞

GENERAL PROPERTIES OF EIGENFUNCTIONS FOR
CLOSED REGIONS
As we discussed in Section 4.4, waveguide problems are a two-dimensional eigen-
function problem, since we only need to consider the waveguide cross-sectional area.
Cavity resonators can be regarded as a three-dimensional eigenfunction problem,
because we need to consider waves in a volume. In either case, we are considering
the region completely surrounded by the boundary and the region does not extend to

infinity. This is called the closed region. If a part of the boundary extends to infinity,
this is called the open region.
Let us consider the general properties of eigenfunctions in a closed region as
defined by (4.20) and (4.21). It was indicated in Section 4.4 that there exists a set of
a doubly infinite number of eigenfunctions
ϕmn,
m = 0, 1, 2, … ∞
n = 0, 1, 2, … , ∞
and the corresponding eigenvalues kmn. The eigenfunction ϕmn satisfies the wave
equation

(4.35)
and boundary conditions. The boundary conditions can be either one of the following
two types:
ϕmn = 0

Since ϕmn and ϕm′n′ satisfy either Dirichlet’s or Neumann’s boundary condition, the
integrand on the left side vanishes, and we obtain
(k2

mn
)
∫ϕm′n′ϕmn da = 0.
(4.45)
Thus if m ≠m′ and n ≠n′, km′n′ ≠kmn, and therefore the integral must be zero,
proving the orthogonality (4.38).
2. ϕn forms a complete set, and thus any continuous function f(̄r) can be expanded
in a series of eigenfunctions. Let us write
f(̄r) =

∑

∑

where ̄r = x̂x + ŷy. Then Amn is given by multiplying both sides of (4.46) by ϕmn(̄r)
and integrating over the cross-sectional area.
Amn = ∫a
f(̄r)ϕmn(̄r) da
∫a
ϕmn(̄r)2 da

In particular, a delta function δ(̄r −̄r′) can be expanded in a series of eigen-

k–𝛃DIAGRAM AND PHASE AND GROUP VELOCITIES
Let us consider a hollow waveguide. Once the eigenvalue kc is determined, the
propagation constant β is given by
β = (k2 −k2
c
)1∕2 .
(4.56)
The eigenvalue kc depends only on the geometry of the guide and is called the cutoff
wave number. It is related to the cutoff wavelength λc and the cutoff frequency fc by
the following:
kc = ωc
c = 2πfc
c
= 2π
λc
.
(4.57)
When the frequency of operation is higher than the cutoff frequency, β is real and
the wave behaves as exp(–jβz), exhibiting the propagation of the wave. On the other
hand, if the operating frequency is below cutoff, the wave is evanescent, and the wave
attenuates as exp(–αz), where α = (k2
c −k2)1∕2 is real.
The frequency characteristics of the propagation constant β and the attenuation
constant α are conventionally expressed in a k–β diagram. For the case of waveguides,
the k–β diagram is given by a hyperbola. Also, the attenuation constant α can be shown
in the same diagram as a circle (Fig. 4.4).
The phase velocity Vp is given by
Vp = ω
β
or
Vp
c = k
β.
(4.58)
If k < β, Vp < c, it is called a slow wave, and if k > β, it is called a fast wave. As seen
in the k–β diagram (Fig. 4.5), the waveguide modes are fast waves.

The group velocity Vg is given by

(4.60)
or its normalized form,
Vg
c = dk

Thus the relative group velocity is given by the slope of the k–β curve at the operating
point:
Vg
c = tan θ2.
(4.61)
It is clear that for the waveguide problem, the wave is fast and
VpVg = c2.
(4.62)
Note that this relation (4.62) is valid only for the form of the propagation constant
given in (4.56) and does not hold for other waveguides, such as dielectric guides.
The group velocity Vg is the velocity of the propagation of the signal as represented
by the envelope of the modulated signal, and it also represents the velocity of the
energy transport. In some cases the phase velocity and the group velocity can be
directed in opposite directions (Fig. 4.6). This is called the backward wave. In contrast,
when the phase and group velocities are directed in the same direction, it is called the
forward wave. The backward waves are important in such applications as backward
wave tubes and log-periodic antennas.

WAVEGUIDES AND CAVITIES
If the waveguide is filled with material with refractive index n, the wave number
k in (4.56) becomes k = k0 n = (ω/c)n. If the refractive index n is constant, the
velocity of light c in (4.56)–(4.62) should be changed to c/n, the velocity of light in
the medium. For dispersive media, n = n(ω), (4.56)–(4.61) are valid if c is replaced
by c/n, but (4.62) does not hold.

RECTANGULAR WAVEGUIDES
Let us consider TM modes in a rectangular guide with sides a and b (Fig. 4.3). As

(4.67)

ab if m = 0 or n = 0. The
eigenvalue k2
mn is the same as the TM case, and this is called the TEmn (or Hmn) mode.
As an important special case, consider the TE10 mode. This mode usually has
the lowest cutoff frequency and is the fundamental mode used for most microwave
waveguides. We can easily obtain the following field components:
Ey = E0 sin πx

(4.68)
The total power propagating through the guide is
P = |E0|2 ab
4Zh

(4.69)
The cutoff wavelength is λc = 2a, and the cutoff frequency is fc = c/2a if the guide
is empty. The cutoff frequency for a guide filled with material with relative dielectric
constant εr is fc = c/2a(εr)1/2.
In general, in a waveguide, there may be many propagating and evanescent modes.
Therefore, a completely general electromagnetic field in a waveguide should consist
of all possible TM and TE modes, and it can be expressed as follows:
̄E = ∇(∇⋅̄π) + k2̄π −jωμ∇× ̄πm,
̄H = jωε∇× ̄π + ∇(∇⋅̄πm) + k2̄πm,

First, we get from (4.77),
X2(ϕ) = c1 sin vϕ + c2 cos vϕ,
(4.78)
where c1 and c2 are constants.

Equation (4.76) is Bessel’s differential equation, and a general solution is given
by
X1(ρ) = c3Jv(kcρ) + c4Nv(kcρ),
(4.79)
where Jν and Nν are called the Bessel function and the Neumann function, respec-
tively. It is sometimes convenient to use the Hankel function of the first kind H(1)
v
and
the second kind H(2)
v :
X1(ρ) = c5H(1)

H(2)
v

(4.81)
The general solution for the Hertz vector is given by (4.73) with the propagation
constant β = (k2 −k2
c)1∕2. Similarly for TE modes, the magnetic Hertz vector πm =
ψe–jβz satisfies the same equation, (4.74).
Let us consider a TM mode propagating in a circular waveguide of radius a
(Fig. 4.7). First, we note that the field must be a periodic function of ϕ with period
2π, and therefore X2(ϕ) is sin nϕ or cos nϕ, where n is an integer. X1(ρ) is given
by (4.79) with Jn(kcρ) and Nn(kcρ), but Nn(kcρ) diverges as ρ →0. Therefore, only
Jn(kcρ) is acceptable. Thus we write
πz(ρ, ϕ, z) = A0Jn(kcρ) cos nϕe−jβz.

Here we used cos nϕ since sin nϕ gives an identical field distribution except for the
rotation of the axis around the z axis. The boundary condition at ρ = a requires that
Jn(kca) = 0.

ϕ(ρ, ϕ) = Jv(kcρ)(c1 sin vϕ + c2 cos vϕ).

ϕ(ρ, ϕ) = 0

ϕ = a,

TEM MODES
A hollow waveguide whose cross section is enclosed by a single wall can propagate
only TE and TM modes: It cannot support a TEM mode. However, a waveguide
consisting of two separate walls, such as coaxial lines and two wire lines, can support
a TEM mode as well as TE and TM modes (Fig. 4.9). Since a TEM mode means that
Ez = 0 and Hz = 0, we get from (4.11) and (4.16)
kc = 0.

From this we get
β = (k2 −k2
c
)1∕2 = k.
(4.99)
Therefore, the propagation constant of the TEM mode is equal to that of the free-space
propagation constant.
Also since kc = 0, ϕ and ψ satisfy the Laplace equation,
∇2ϕ = 0,
∇2ψ = 0.
(4.100)
If the waveguide is hollow and enclosed by a single wall, the solution to the Laplace
equation with either Dirichlet’s or Neumann’s boundary condition is identically zero
or constant, and therefore the field is identically zero from (4.11) and (4.16).
If the waveguide consists of two surfaces, the potential ϕ can be a constant ϕ =
ϕ1 on one surface c1 and a different constant ϕ = ϕ2 on the other surface c2 and
the solution exists. The TEM mode is given by the solution of the Laplace equation
(4.100), and ϕ(x, y) = ϕ1 on c1 and ϕ2 on c2. From (4.11), letting V = jkϕ,
̄Et(x, y, z) = −∇V(x, y)e−jkz,
̄Ht = 1
η ̂z × ̄Et,
(4.101)
∇2V = 0.
Note that V(x, y) satisfies the Laplace equation and is identical to a two-dimensional
electrostatic potential function, and the electric field distribution ̄Et is identical to the
electrostatic field.

WAVEGUIDES AND CAVITIES
4.10
DISPERSION OF A PULSE IN A WAVEGUIDE
The propagation constant β for a hollow waveguide is given by β = (k2 −k2
c)1∕2,
where k = ω/c. If β is equal to k = ω/c, the phase velocity and the group velocity are
identical and when a pulse propagates, all the frequency components propagate with
the same velocity and no distortion of the pulse shape takes place. However, when
β is a more general function of frequency, the different frequency components of a
pulse propagate with different velocities, and the waveform is distorted. The variation
of the phase velocity with frequency is called the dispersion. To calculate the output
waveform, we first take the Fourier transform of the input, multiply it by the transfer
function, and then take the inverse Fourier transform.
In many practical problems, the pulse input is a modulated wave centered at a
carrier frequency. In this section, we first present a general formulation of the propa-
gation of a modulated pulse in a dispersive waveguide and then give an approximate
and useful solution for the broadening of a pulse in such a waveguide.
Let us consider a TE10 mode in a rectangular waveguide. We assume that at z =
0, Ey is given as a modulated wave with carrier frequency ω0.
Ey(0, t) = A(t) cos[ω0t + ϕ(t)] = Re [u0(t)ejω0t] ,
(4.102)
where A(t) and ϕ(t) are the slowly varying amplitude and phase, u0(t) is the complex
envelope u(z, t) evaluated at z = 0, and u0 = A exp (jϕ). The complex envelope u(z,
t) is related to the analytic signal ua = u exp(jω0t) (see Born and Wolf, 1970). In
(4.102), the variation sin(πx/a) of Ey in the waveguide is independent of z and t and
is included in A(t).
Let us first express the analytic signal ua(0, t) at z = 0 in a Fourier integral.
ua(0, t) = u0(t)ejω0t = 1
2π ∫Ua(ω)ejωtdω.
(4.103)
The Fourier component Ua is therefore given by
Ua(ω) = ∫u0(t)ejω0t−jωtdt
= U(ω −ω0),
(4.104)
where U(ω′) is the Fourier transform of the complex envelope.
U(ω′) = ∫u0 (t) e−jω′tdt.
(4.105)
Equation (4.104) shows that the Fourier component of the modulated pulse is given
by the Fourier component of the complex envelope centered at the carrier frequency.

DISPERSION OF A PULSE IN A WAVEGUIDE
107
Each Fourier component at a point z ≠0 satisfies the wave equation and its
propagation characteristics are given by the dependence exp(–jβz). Therefore, adding
all the frequency components, the field at z ≠0 is given by
Ey(z, t) = Re
[
1
2π ∫U(ω −ω0)ejωt−jβz dω
]
.
(4.106)
This is a general expression for the wave Ey(z, t) propagating in a dispersive guide.
Note that (4.106) is equivalent to an inverse Laplace transform (jω = s), and therefore
the evaluation of the integral for a general transient problem requires a detailed study
of an integral in a complex plane by allowing ω to be a complex variable.
Next we consider a simpler, special case when the pulse is narrow band and β(ω)
is a slowly varying function of ω. Since ω – ω0 ≪ω0, we expand the exponent in
Taylor’s series and keep its first three terms.
β(ω) = β(ω0) + (ω −ω0) ∂β
∂ω
||||ω0
+ 1
2(ω −ω0)2 ∂2β

(4.107)
Substituting this into (4.106), we get
Ey(z, t) = Re[u(z, t)ejω0t],
u(z, t) = 1

(4.108)
where
t0 = z ∂β

and
∂2β
∂ω2 is evaluated at ω0.
(4.109)
In general, the propagation constant β(ω) for a lossy guide is complex, and therefore
t0 is also complex and the physical meaning of the complex t0 is difficult to determine.
For a lossless guide, however, the meaning of t0 is clear. If we write t0 = (z/Vg), Vg =
(∂β/∂ω)–1 is real for a lossless guide and is called the group velocity, representing the
velocity of the signal. t0 is called the group delay, and ̂t0 = ∂β∕∂ω = V−1
g
is called
the specific group delay (group delay per unit distance).
The second term in the exponent of (4.109) involving ∂2β/∂ω2 represents the
broadening of the pulse. If this term is negligibly small, the field is given by
Ey (z, t) = Re
[
u0(t −t0)ejω
0t−jb(w)z

]
.
(4.110)
This shows that in this case, if the medium is lossless, the wave propagates without
distortion, with the group velocity.

envelope
Ey(0, t) = A0 exp

cos ω0t.
(4.111)
The complex envelope at z = 0 is then

(4.114)
where S = (2∕T0)(∂2β∕∂ω2)|ω0z. Note that the pulse width is broadened from the
initial value of T0 to
T = (T2
0 + S2)1∕2.
(4.115)
For a lossless guide, we can obtain the physical meaning of S. Noting that the
group delay is given by t0 = (∂β/∂ω)z, S may be written as Δω ∂t0/∂ω, where Δω =
(2/T0) is the bandwidth of the Gaussian pulse at z = 0. ∂t0/∂ω is the group delay per
unit frequency, and therefore S is the total group delay caused by all the frequency
components of the pulse. In some cases, the pulse broadening parameter S is expressed
in terms of the free-space wavelength λ0 = 2π/k0. Noting that
ωλ0 = 2πc

For example, in optical fibers, the pulse broadening is normally given by |∂̂τ∕∂λ0| in
units of (ns(km)-1(nm)-1), and when multiplied by Δλ (in nm of source bandwidth), it
gives the spread |̂S| in nanoseconds per kilometer of fiber. D = ∂̂τ∕∂λ0 is called the
dispersive parameter or simply the dispersion.

STEP-INDEX OPTICAL FIBERS
Optical fibers commonly used in optical communications are divided into step-index
fibers and graded-index fibers. A step-index fiber consists of the circular center core
with refractive index n1 and a surrounding cladding with n2. A graded-index fiber,
also called GRIN, has a core with a slowly varying refractive index (Fig. 4.10). In this
section, we examine the propagation characteristics of the wave along the step-index
fibers. It is clear from Section 3.11 that in order to support the trapped surface wave
along the core, the refractive index of the core must be higher than that of the cladding.
In our analysis, we assume that the cladding extends to infinity since the wave in the
cladding decays exponentially in the radial direction, and the outer boundary of the
cladding has little effect on the propagation characteristics (see Marcuse, 1982).
Let us consider a wave propagating along a dielectric cylinder of radius a7
(Fig. 4.11). It was shown in Section 4.1 that a general electromagnetic field con-
sists of TM and TE modes. For the TM (transverse magnetic) modes, the magnetic
fields are transverse to a fixed direction denoted by a unit vector ̂a. For the TE (trans-
verse electric) modes, the electric fields are all transverse to ̂a. All the TE modes can
be derived from a magnetic Hertz vector ̄πm = πm̂a, all the TM modes can be derived
from an electric Hertz vector ̄π = πm̂a, and πm and π satisfy a scalar wave equation.
For cylindrical geometry, (ρ, ϕ, z), we take ̂a = ̂z and write ̄π = πẑz and ̄πm = πmẑz.
The solution to the scalar wave equation is given by a product of Bessel functions Zn
(pρ) exp(±jnϕ) and exp(±jβz), where p and β are constant and satisfy the condition

p2 + β2 = k2 (see Section 4.8). In general, for a dielectric waveguide, TE and TM
modes are coupled and both are needed to satisfy the boundary conditions, except
for the case where there is no azimuthal variation (∂/∂ϕ = 0). Let us write the Hertz

We note that only when n = 0, (4.127) separates into two equations corresponding
to TM and TE modes. But, in general, TM and TE modes are mixed, and they are
called hybrid modes and are designated as EHnm or HEnm modes, depending on
whether TM or TE modes are dominant. The HE11 mode is the only mode that does
not have a low-frequency cutoff and is often called the HE11 dipole mode. This is
equivalent to the lowest TM mode on a dielectric slab (Fig. 4.12).
The frequency dependence of the propagation constant β is conveniently expressed
in terms of the normalized propagation constant b as functions of the normalized
frequency V.

The cutoff frequency of the HE11 mode is zero. The modes with the next-lowest
cutoff frequencies are the TE01 and TM01 modes (n = 0). Their cutoff frequencies
are obtained by letting n = 0 in (4.127), thus separating the equation into TE and
TM modes, and then by recognizing that the cutoff requires u2 →0. Noting that
as u2 →0,

λc

(4.131)
where λc is the cutoff wavelength and Δ ∼(n1 – n2)/n1. We conclude that as long as
V < 2.4048, only a single mode can propagate along the optical fiber. For example,
for typical values of n1 = 1.48, n2 = 1.46, and λ0 = 0.82 μm, the maximum fiber
diameter that supports the single mode is 2a = 2.59 μm.
In contrast to the single-mode fiber, a fiber with a large diameter (50 μm, for
example) supports many modes and is called the multimode fiber. In this case, the
number of modes for a given normalized frequency V is approximately given by the
mode volume formula
N ≈1
2V2.
(4.132)
This may be compared with the number of modes for a dielectric slab, N ≈2V/π for
the total TE and TM modes.
The specific group delay (group delay per unit length) ̂τ is given by
̂τ = dβ
dω,
(4.133)
and the increase of the pulse width per unit length of the fiber is given by
̂S = d̂τ
dλ.

The dispersion is then expressed by
D = d̂τ
dλ,
(4.135)
measured in ns(km)−1(nm)−1. When multiplied by the source spectrum width Δλs,
(4.135) gives the pulse broadening in ns/km.
The dispersion over a distance L can also be expressed in terms of the
bandwidth B:
B = (Δ̂τL)−1.
(4.136)
We can then define the bandwidth–distance product:
BL = (Δ̂τ)−1 Hz km.
(4.137)
The dispersion of a single-mode fiber consists of material dispersion and mode
dispersion. The mode dispersion depends on the mode structure and therefore depends
also on the radius of the fiber. The material dispersion is caused by the variation of
refractive index with frequency and can be described by Sellmeier’s equation (Chapter
8). Dispersion curves for fused silica fibers are sketched in Fig. 4.14. Note that the
dispersion disappears at a certain wavelength. The material dispersion (a →∞) for
fused silica disappears at λ = 1.27 μm, but because of the mode dispersion, the
vanishing dispersion point is shifted. It is sometimes desirable to shift this point to
the minimum-loss wavelength. For example, fibers made of germanium-doped fused

silica have a minimum loss of 0.2 dB/km near λ = 1.55 μm. Recently, long-wavelength
systems with 1.3 μm wavelength with minimum dispersion have been developed. A
typical bandwidth–distance product can be BL ≥100 GHz ⋅km at 1.3 μm for the
source spectrum width Δλs = 10 nm and the loss may be 0.27 dB/km. At 1.5–1.65 μm,
the dispersion is much greater than at 1.3 μm and BL is only about 5 GHz ⋅km with
Δλs = 10 nm.
The dispersion of a multimode fiber consists of the material dispersion and the
intermodal dispersion. The intermodal dispersion is caused by the different group
delays of many modes. An estimate of the pulse spread of step-index multimode
fibers can be made by noting the difference in travel time between the longest ray
path and the shortest ray path. The shortest ray path is a straight line inside the fiber,
and the travel time over the distance z along the fiber is (n1/c)z. The largest path
is when the path makes the maximum angle with the z axis, which corresponds to
the critical angle θc for total reflection on the fiber surface. Beyond this maximum
angle, the rays escape from the fiber. Thus the travel time along this longest path
is (n1/c)(z/sin θc) = (n1/c)(n1/n2)z. Therefore, the pulse spread Δ̂τ per unit distance
along the fiber is given by
Δ̂τ ∼(n1∕c)(n1 −n2)
n2
= (n1∕c)(n1∕n2)Δ,
Δ = n1 −n2
n1
.
(4.138)
Note that the dispersion for a step-index fiber is proportional to Δ. It will be shown
in Section 4.12 that the dispersion of the graded-index fiber is much less than
(4.138) and is proportional to Δ2. Multimode short-wavelength systems operating
at a 0.85 μm wavelength are commercially available with a typical loss of 2.5 dB/km
and a bandwidth–distance product of several hundred MHz ⋅km.
One of the important parameters of a multimode fiber is its numerical aperture
(NA). It is a measure of the ability to gather light into the fiber and is given by the
sine of the maximum angle of the entrance of a ray that is trapped in the core (Fig.
4.15). Noting that the maximum angle θ occurs when the angle θc is the critical angle
for total reflection, we get
NA = sin θ = (n2

DISPERSION OF GRADED-INDEX FIBERS
In Section 3.17, we discussed the surface-wave modes in an inhomogeneous slab
using the WKB method. The propagation constant β is obtained by (3.165). By
differentiating (3.165) with respect to ω and noting that even though z1 and z2 depend
on β and therefore on ω, (∂z1/∂ω)q(z1) = (∂z2/∂ω)q(z2) = 0, we get the specific group

The material dispersion dn/dω = cdn/dk0 is included in the above. The maximum
and minimum values of ̂τ are obtained by letting β = k0n2 and k0n1, respectively, and
therefore the pulse spread Δ̂τ per unit length is given by
Δ̂τ = ̂τ(β = k0n2) −̂τ(β = k0n1).

Because of symmetry, we have z2 = – z1 and q(z2) = 0. Substituting (4.142) into
(4.140), we get, assuming no material dispersion,
̂τ =
n1[1 −Δ(z2∕a)20

the graded-index fiber is proportional to Δ2 and is much smaller than that for the
step-index fiber.

RADIAL AND AZIMUTHAL WAVEGUIDES
The formulations given in Section 4.8 on cylindrical structures are applicable not
only to a uniform waveguide in which the wave propagates in the z direction, but
also to nonuniform waveguides in which the wave propagates in the radial (ρ) or the
azimuthal directions (ϕ). Before we discuss the radial and azimuthal waveguides, let
us summarize the boundary conditions in terms of the electric and magnetic Hertz
vectors.
̄π = πẑz
and
̄πm = πmẑz.
(4.145)
The boundary conditions for a perfectly conducting wall (electric wall) parallel to
the z axis are
πz = 0
and
∂πmz
∂n
= 0.
(4.146)
These correspond to the TM and TE modes in metallic waveguides. The boundary
conditions for a perfectly conducting wall perpendicular to the z axis are
∂πz
∂n = 0
and
πmz = 0.
(4.147)
Similarly, for a magnetic wall where the tangential magnetic field vanishes, we
have
∂πz
∂n = 0
and
πmz = 0,
(4.148)
on a wall parallel to the z axis, and

Note that for TM modes, the lowest n is zero. In this case kρ = k, but for TE modes,
the lowest n is one, and thus there is a low-frequency cutoff.

An example of the azimuthal wave propagation is a waveguide bend (Fig. 4.19). Let

the H plane, we can express πz in the following manner:
πz = Zv(kρ)e−jvϕ,
(4.155)
where
Zv(kρ) = Jv(kρ)Nv (ka) −Jv (ka) Nv(kρ),
and thus Zv (ka) = 0, satisfying the boundary conditions at ρ = a,
πz|ρ=a = 0.

The resonant frequency is given by (4.161).
As an example of the cylindrical cavity, consider a circular microstrip antenna
(Fig. 4.20). This antenna is fed by a coaxial line located off the center of the patch.
The current on the patch is then similar to that of a horizontal dipole, and the radiation
is in the broadside direction. Microstrip antennas are therefore useful as low-profile
antennas on the surface of aircraft. The microstrip antenna is high Q and narrow band
and is operated near the resonant frequency of the cylindrical cavity of radius a and
height h. The top and bottom surfaces are conducting (electric wall), while the side is
open. The radiating power is transmitted through the side and some reactive power is
stored near the fringe of the patch. However, as a first approximation, we assume that
on the side, the tangential magnetic field is negligibly small (magnetic wall). Noting
Fig. 4.16, the boundary conditions for TM modes are
∂πz
∂z = 0

For TE modes, the boundary conditions are

From Table 4.1, it is seen that the lowest eigenvalue χ11 = 1.841 is obtained from
J′
n(χnl) = 0 when n = 1 and l = 1. Thus the lowest resonant frequency is obtained
for the TM11 mode with the boundary condition (4.163). The field for this cavity is,
therefore, given by

Unlike the cylindrical coordinate system, the spherical coordinate system does not
possess an axis with constant direction, and the formulation based on π̂a and πm̂a in
(4.2) cannot be used. Therefore, it is necessary to devise a different method by which
all the field components can be derived from scalar functions satisfying a well-known
differential equation. This can be done by a special choice of the Hertz vector, and the
complete electromagnetic fields can be described by two scalar functions that satisfy
a scalar wave equation.
Let us re-examine the derivation of the Hertz vector. We need a condition similar to
but different from the Lorentz condition, which yields the desired result. We consider
the time-harmonic case and start with the vector potential ̄A and scalar potential Φ.
Rewriting (2.84) for the time-harmonic case, we get
−∇× ∇× ̄A + k2 ̄A = jωμε∇Φ −μ̄J.
(4.167)
We need to find the relationship between ̄A and Φ such that (4.167) reduces to a
simpler scalar equation in a spherical coordinate system. Let us assume that ̄A and ̄J
have only the radial component Ar and Jr.
̄A = Ar̂r
and
̄J = Jr̂r.

The Lorentz condition ∇⋅̄A + jωμε Φ = 0 in (2.87) cannot simplify (4.170). Instead,
we use
∂Ar
∂r + jωμε Φ = 0.
(4.171)
Then (4.170) is automatically satisfied, and (4.169) becomes

(4.172)
This is a simple differential equation. However, it would be more convenient if this
was transformed into a scalar wave equation. This can be accomplished by choosing
jωμεrπr = Ar.
(4.173)
Then (4.172) becomes
(∇2 + k2)πr = −Jr

A definite advantage of using the scalar wave equation is that its solution has been
extensively studied and is well documented. The fields derived from πz are called E
modes or TM modes because the only radial component is the electric field and all
the magnetic fields are transverse to the radial vector.

In the above, we used the source term of the radial electric current Jr and the radial
magnetic current Jmr. For those radial current sources, πr and πmr are simply related
to Jr and Jmr, as shown in (4.174). For a more general source current with θ and ϕ
components, the relationships are more complicated. It should, however, be noted
that the completely general electromagnetic field in the spherical coordinate system
can be expressed by two scalar functions πr and πmr.
Let us now consider a formal solution of the homogeneous wave equation in the
spherical coordinate system.
(∇2 + k2)πr = 0.

X3(ϕ) = C1ejμϕ + C2e−jμϕ

(4.183)
where all C are constant.

Let us consider X2(θ) in (4.181). This is the Legendre differential equation, and
X2 is given by a linear combination of its two independent solutions. We consider the
following three cases.
1. μ = 0, ν = n integer. In this case, X2(θ) is given by
X2(θ) = C1Pn(cos θ) + C2Qn(cos θ).
(4.187)
Pn(x), x = cos θ, is a polynomial of degree n.
P0(x) = 1,
P1(x) = x,
(4.188)
P2(x) = 1
2(3x2 −1).
Pn(x) is an even function of x when n is even and an odd function when n is odd.
Pn(x) is also regular in the range, –1 ≤x ≤1 (π ≥θ ≥0). Qn(x) is called the Legendre
function of the second kind and becomes infinite at θ = 0 and π.

n (cos θ).

n are called the associated Legendre function of the first kind and the second

Let us consider waves propagating in each of the three orthogonal directions in the
spherical coordinate system.
4.16.1
Wave Propagation in the Radial Direction
As an example, consider a wave propagating in the radial direction in a conical
waveguide (Fig. 4.21). TM waves can be expressed by the following Hertz potential:
πr =
∑

∑

An example of this case is the VLF propagation between the spherical earth and the
ionosphere. For example, we may consider a resonance in a spherical cavity formed

πr = Pm
n (cos θ)Zn(kr)
(
cos mϕ
sin mϕ
)
,
(4.193)
where Zn(kr) is a linear combination of two spherical Bessel functions that satisfy
the boundary condition at the earth surface and the ionosphere. If we assume that the
earth surface (r = a) and the lower edge of the ionosphere (r = b) are conducting, the
boundary conditions are
∂
∂r
(rπr
) = 0
at r = a and b.

C1 = ∂
∂r
[rh(2)

(4.195)
C2 = −∂
∂r[rjn(kr)]|r=a.
The resonant frequency fr is then given by k = 2πfr/c, which satisfies
∂
∂r[rZn(kr)]|r=b = 0.
(4.196)
This yields the following equation to determine the resonant frequency:
∂
∂r[rjn(kr)]

(4.197)
The resonance phenomena above were first studied by Schumann and are now called
the Schumann resonance. Although (4.197) gives the exact equation for the resonant
frequency when both the ionosphere and the earth are assumed conducting, it is
instructive to obtain an approximate solution for the Schumann resonance. We first
note that the boundary condition (4.194) requires the derivative of rπr. Thus we let
rX1 = u in (4.180) and obtain
[
d2
dr2 + k2 −n(n + 1)
r2
]
u(r) = 0.
(4.198)
Now since the distance between the ionosphere and the earth is very much smaller
than the earth’s radius, we let r ∼a + z ∼a and approximate (4.198) by
[

u(z) = 0,

An example may be a leaky waveguide around a sphere. A general form of πr is
then
πr = zv(kr)Pμ
v(cos θ)e−jμϕ,
(4.202)
where μ is the azimuthal propagation constant.
Let us now consider the boundary conditions for a perfectly conducting wall (Fig.
4.23). Consider a surface containing a radial vector. At ϕ = constant, Er and Eθ must
be zero. At θ = constant, Er and Eϕ must be zero. They are satisfied if
πr = 0
and
∂
∂nπmr = 0.

Once νn is determined, the boundary condition at r = a is applied and yields the
resonant frequency fr (or wavelength λr), given by kr = ωr/c = 2π/λr, ωr = 2πfr,
where Xr = kra is the root of

these two sources are the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole. An arbitrary source

For a short wire antenna, I(z) is known to have a triangular shape, and therefore L0 =

Let us next consider the magnetic dipole. If the current I0 flows in a small loop
with the area A, the magnetic dipole moment ̄m is defined by
̄m = I0Â𝑖,
(5.3)

The electric current density ̄J given in (5.1) and the magnetic current density ̄Jm
given in (5.5) are the two basic sources of electromagnetic fields. In general, many
other practical sources can be represented by continuous distributions of the electric
and magnetic current sources. For example, a long wire antenna can be regarded as
a continuous distribution of the electric dipole source. Another common source is
aperture fields for parabolic dish antennas and slot antennas. They can be represented
by the electric or magnetic current distribution over the surface.
5.2
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS EXCITED BY AN ELECTRIC DIPOLE
IN A HOMOGENEOUS MEDIUM
The time-harmonic electromagnetic wave excited by the current source ̄Js is given in
terms of the Hertz vector ̄πt (Section 2.7)
E = ∇(∇⋅̄π)′ + k2̄π,
H = jω ∈∇× ̄π,
and
(∇2 + k2)̄π = −Ks
jω ∈,
(5.6)
where k = ω√με and μ and ε are, in general, complex.
Let us consider the electromagnetic field excited by an electric dipole pointed in
the z direction and located at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. The electric
dipole is represented by
Js = ̂zI0L0δ(r).
(5.7)
The z component of ̄π then satisfies
(∇2 + k2)πz = I0L0
jω ∈δ(r).
(5.8)
We write (5.8) using a function G(r) which satisfies the equation
(∇2 + k2)G(̄r, ̄r′) = −δ(̄r −̄r′).
(5.9)
Then πz is given by
πz = I0L0
jω ∈G(̄r, 0).

GREEN’S FUNCTIONS
Note that once we solve (5.9), the solution ̄π is given by (5.10) and the fields are
given by (5.6).
The function G(̄r, ̄r′) is called Green’s function and represents the response of a
physical system in space due to a point exciting source δ(̄r −̄r′). The differential
equation (5.9) alone is insufficient to determine Green’s function uniquely, and it
is necessary to apply additional conditions. These conditions are (1) the radiation
condition at infinity whenever the region extends to infinity and (2) the boundary
conditions. Therefore, Green’s function G(̄r, ̄r′) must satisfy the inhomogeneous
differential equation of the type (5.9) and the radiation and boundary conditions.
Let us solve (5.9) in free space satisfying the radiation condition. We choose ̄r′ to
be at the origin, and thus G(̄r) is spherically symmetric and a function of r only. We
write (5.9) as
[ 1
r2
d
dr
(
r2 d
dr
)
+ k2]
G(r) = −δ(r).
(5.11)
The solution is given by
G(r) = exp(−jkr)
4πr
.
(5.12)
To show this, first we consider G(̄r) when ̄r ≠0. Here δ(r) = 0. We then let G = u/r
and obtain
(
d2
dr2 + k2
)
u(4) = 0,
whose general solution is
u(r) = c1e−jkr + c2e+jkr,
c1, c2 constants.
Therefore, for r ≠0, G is given by
G(r) = 1
r (c1e−jkr + c2e+jkr).
(5.13)
Now G(r) is the wave originating at r = 0, and at infinity, the wave must be
outgoing. The first term of (5.13) represents the outgoing wave, but the second term
represents the incoming wave. Even though both terms vanish at r →∞, the second
term must be discarded because there should be no incoming wave from infinity.
This is called the radiation condition or Sommerfeld radiation condition, and its
mathematical expression is given by (Section 2.4)
lim
r→∞r
(∂G
∂r + jkG
)
= 0.
(5.14)

ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS EXCITED BY AN ELECTRIC DIPOLE
141
Only the first term of (5.13) satisfies (5.14) as expected, and therefore c2 must be
zero.
Next we determine the constant c1 by considering the behavior of G near the
origin. To do this, let us write (5.9) as follows:
∇⋅(∇G) + k2G = −δ(r),
(5.15)
and integrate both sides over a small spherical volume of radius r0 and let the radius
r0 approach zero
lim
r0→0 ∫V
[Δ ⋅(ΔG) + k2G]dV = −lim
r0→0 ∫V
δ(r)dV.
(5.16)
The right side is –1. The first term in the left side becomes, using the divergence
theorem, –4πc1. The second term in the left becomes zero. Therefore, (5.16) becomes
−4πc1 = −1,
from which we obtain c1 = 1/4π.
Thus Green’s function G(̄r, ̄r′) satisfying
(∇2 + k2)G(̄r, ̄r′) = −δ(̄r −̄r′)
(5.17)
and the radiation condition at infinity is given by
G(̄r, ̄r′) = e−jk|̄r−̄r′|
4π|̄r −̄r′|.
(5.18)
Using this Green’s function, the Hertz vector due to an electric dipole located at the
origin pointed in the ̂z direction is given by
̄π = ̂zπz
= ̂zI0L0
jωε G(̄r)
= ̂zI0L0

(5.19)
The electric and magnetic fields are given by (5.6). We may use the spherical coor-
dinate system, writing
̄π = πr̂r + πθ̂θ + πϕ ̂ϕ,

where
πr = πẑz ⋅̂r = πz cos θ,

We note that the radial component Er is proportional to r–2 and r–3, while Eθ and
Hϕ contain the term with r–1. Thus at a large distance from the dipole, the radial
component Er vanishes much faster than Eθ and Hϕ. The range |k0r| ≫1 is called
the far zone and the field in this range is called the far field. Similarly, the field in the
near zone |k0r| ≪1 is called the near field.
In the far zone, the field components are given by
Eθ = j(I0L0)ωμe−jkr
4πr sin θ,
Hϕ = j(I0L0)ke−jkr
4πr sin θ,
(5.22)
and therefore, the radiation pattern is proportional to sin θ (see Fig. 5.3). The electric
field Eθ and the magnetic field Hϕ are perpendicular to each other, and both are

(5.23)
Note that these are also the characteristics of a plane wave, and thus the spherical
wave radiating from a dipole behaves like a plane wave at a large distance except that
the amplitude decreases as 1/r.
Let us examine the total real power radiated from the dipole. If the medium is
lossless, μ and ε are real and all the power radiated from the dipole must be equal to
the power flowing out from any surface enclosing the dipole. In particular, we may
take the surface to be that of a sphere with a large radius so that (5.22) holds. The
total real power Pt is given by integrating the Poynting vector over this sphere.

The effectiveness of an antenna may be expressed by the amount of real power the

The expression (5.27) is applicable only to a short dipole (L ≪λ), but it is a good
approximation for dipoles of lengths up to a quarter wavelength.
The radiation resistance (5.27) is the equivalent resistance of the input impedance
of the dipole antenna representing the radiation and is independent of the wire radius.
In addition to the radiation resistance, there is the resistance R0 representing the
ohmic loss of the wire and the reactance X (Fig. 5.4). The reactance X represents the
stored energy in the near field of the antenna and depends on the geometry and the
radius of the wire and requires a detailed study of the field near the dipole.

ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS EXCITED BY A MAGNETIC DIPOLE

As we noted in Section 5.1, a small loop antenna can be represented by a magnetic
current dipole
̄Jm = ̂𝑖jωμ0I0Aδ(̄r −̄r′).
(5.28)
We can derive electromagnetic fields due to the magnetic dipole by using the duality
principle. If E, H, ̄J, ̄π, μ, and ε for the case of an electric dipole are replaced
by −H, E, −̄Jm, −̄πm, ε, and μ, then Maxwell’s equations and the formulations in
terms of the Hertz vectors are unchanged, and we have
E = −jωμ∇× ̄πm,
H = ∇(∇⋅̄πm) + k2 ̄πm,
and

When an electric dipole is located near a conducting planar surface, the total field
can conveniently be expressed as a sum of the field due to the dipole and the field due
to an image of the dipole. For a vertical electric dipole located above a conducting
plane as shown in Fig. 5.5, the field due to the image must be such that the total
electric field tangential to the conducting surface vanishes. From (5.21), since r1 =
r2 and θ1 = π – θ2, we can easily show that the total electric field due to the vertical
electric dipole and its image dipole oriented in the same direction have no tangential
component on the surface of the conductor. Similarly, the image of a horizontal
electric dipole is directed opposite to the dipole (Fig. 5.5). We can also follow similar
reasoning to show that the image of a vertical magnetic dipole is directed opposite
while the image of a horizontal magnetic dipole is directed parallel to the dipole.

function in a homogeneous medium. In general, however, Green’s function must
satisfy appropriate boundary condition.
If the region under consideration extends to infinity, it is called the open region.
Green’s function in the open region can be represented by Fourier transform, and this
will be discussed later. In this section we consider the finite closed region V surrounded
by a surface S (Fig. 5.6). In this case it is possible to construct Green’s function in terms
of a series of eigenfunctions. In addition to the foregoing two representations, Fourier
transform and eigenfunctions, we can express a one-dimensional Green’s function
in terms of solutions of homogeneous differential equations. We will discuss these
three representations of Green’s functions.
Let us consider a volume V surrounded by a surface S (Fig. 5.6). Green’s function
is a solution to an inhomogeneous wave equation with the delta function as an exciting
source and satisfies an appropriate boundary condition on S.
(∇2 + k2)G(̄r, ̄r′) = −δ(̄r −̄r)
in V,

and the boundary condition on S can be one of the following:
G = 0
Dirichlet’s condition,
∂G
∂n = 0
Neumann’s condition,
G + h∂G
∂n = 0
general homogeneous condition.
(5.34)
Since any function can be expressed by a series of eigenfunctions, we seek to
represent G in the following form:
G =
∑
n
Anϕn(̄r),
(5.35)
where An is an unknown coefficient and ϕn is an eigenfunction. Here the summation
over n means triple summation for the three-dimensional case, double summation for
the two-dimensional case, and single summation for the one-dimensional case.
We also expand the delta function in a series of eigenfunctions
δ(̄r −̄r′) =
∑
n
Bnϕn(̄r),
(5.36)
where Bn is given by multiplying both sides of (5.36) by ϕm(̄r) and integrating over
the volume. Noting the orthogonality of eigenfunctions,
∫V
ϕn(̄r)ϕm(̄r)dV = 0
for n ≠m,
(5.37)
we get
Bn =
∫V δ(̄r −̄r′)ϕn(̄r)dV
∫V [ϕn(̄r)]2dV
=
ϕn(̄r′)
∫V [ϕn(̄r)]2dV
.
(5.38)
Substituting (5.35) and (5.36) in the wave equation (5.33), we get
∑
n
(∇2 + k2)Anϕn(̄r) = −
∑

Bnϕn(̄r).
(5.39)
Since
(∇2 + k2

the left side of (5.39) becomes
∑
n
(k2 −k2
n)Anϕn(̄r).
Now both sides of (5.39) are expansions in terms of the same orthogonal functions
ϕn, and therefore the coefficient of each term must be equal. Thus
(k2 −k2
n)An = −Bn,
from which the unknown coefficients An are obtained.
Green’s function is then given by

where

is a normalization factor. Equation (5.40) holds as long as kn ≠k. If for a particular
n = n0, kn0 = k, Green’s function diverges unless the source is located at a zero of
the eigenfunction ϕn0(̄r′) = 0. In this case the term for this particular n0 should be
excluded.
Let us apply the general expression (5.40) to the one-dimensional problem. Let us
assume that Green’s function satisfies Dirichlet’s condition at z = 0 and z = a, and
0 < z′ < a.

GREEN’S FUNCTION IN TERMS OF SOLUTIONS OF THE
HOMOGENEOUS EQUATION
The representation of Green’s function in terms of a series of eigenfunctions is, in
fact, an expression in the form of resonant cavity modes, but this is not the only
representation. Green’s function can also be expressed in terms of the solutions of a
homogeneous equation, as discussed in this section.
Consider a general second-order differential equation

GREEN’S FUNCTION IN TERMS OF SOLUTIONS OF THE HOMOGENEOUS EQUATION
151
The function f(z) on the right side is introduced so that Green’s function becomes
symmetric with respect to z and z′, as will be seen shortly. This is consistent with
Green’s function for wave equations in cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems.
Let us write (5.55) as
[
d2
dz2 + p (z) d
dz + q(z)
]
G(z, z′) = −δ(z −z′)
f(z)
,
(5.56)
where
p(z) =

f(z)
df(z)
dz ,
(5.57)
or
f(z) = exp[∫p(z)dz].
(5.58)
For the region z > z′, G(z, z′) is a solution of the homogeneous differential equation
[

f(z)

dz
(
f(z) d

)
+ q(z)
]
G(z, z′) = 0.
(5.59)
We write this solution as
G(z, z′) = A0y1(z).
(5.60)
For the region z < z′, we write
G(z, z′) = B0y2(z).
(5.61)
Let us now use the following properties of Green’s function.
1. The first derivative of Green’s function has a jump at z = z′. From the differential
equation, note that the second derivative of G should have the behavior of the
delta function. Thus the first derivative has a discontinuity. The function itself,
however, is continuous being an integral of the first derivative. Thus we have
the second property.
2. Green’s function is a continuous function of z when z′ is fixed, including z =
z′.
3. We also note that, in general, Green’s function is symmetric with respect to ̄r
and ̄r′ as a direct consequence of the reciprocity theorem.
G(̄r, ̄r′) = G(̄r′, ̄r).
(5.62)

GREEN’S FUNCTIONS
We make use of the foregoing properties to obtain the constants A0 and B0. First
we note that G is continuous at z = z′. Then we get
A0y1(z′) −B0y2(z′) = 0.
(5.63)
Next we note that the first derivative of G is discontinuous. To make use of this,
let us integrate the original differential equation with a weighting function f(z) from
z′ – ε to z′ + ε and let ε approach zero. Thus we get
lim
ε→0 ∫

G dz = −∫

The right side becomes –1, and therefore,

Here we must use A0y′

2(z′) = −1
f(z′),
(5.65)
where y′

Solving (5.63) and (5.65) for A0 and B0, we get

Note that both the numerator and the denominator contain the product of y1 and y2
or its derivative such as y1y2, y1y′
2, and so on. Thus any constant in front of y1 and y2
cancels out, and therefore, only the form of the function for y1 and y2 is necessary.
Its magnitude does not affect the final form. Δ(z′) is called the Wronskian of y1 and

y2, and since it has some useful characteristics, some of the details are given below.
The denominator f(z′)Δ(z′) of (5.69) and (5.70) appears to be a function of z′, and
if so, G(z, z′) is not symmetric. It will be shown shortly, however, that f(z′)Δ(z′)
is constant and is independent of z′. The final form of Green’s function G(z, z′) is
therefore given by

where D = f(z′)Δ(z′) = constant.
Equations (5.71) and (5.72) are often combined in the following convenient form:
G(z, z′) = y1(z>)y2(z<)
D
,
(5.73)
where z> and z< denote the greater or lesser of z and z′.
Let us consider the Wronskian Δ(z), which we write in the following form:
Δ(y1, y2) = y1 y′
2 −y′
1 y2,
(5.74)
where y1 = y1(z) and y2 = y2(z), and y′
1 = dy1∕dz and y′
2 = dy2∕dz. First, we note that
if y1 and y2 are two independent solutions of the homogeneous differential equation,
then Δ(y1, y2) ≠0, but if y1 and y2 are dependent, then Δ(y1, y2) = 0, as can be
verified by (5.74).
Let us next find the form of the Wronskian. To do this, we first show that Δ satisfies
a simple first-order differential equation. Taking the derivative of Δ, we get
dΔ
dz = d
dz(y1y′
2 −y′
1y2)
= y1y′′
2 −y2y′′

(5.75)
But y1 and y2 satisfy the differential equation
y′′
1 + py′
1 + qy1 = 0,
y′′
2 + py′
2 + qy2 = 0.
(5.76)
Thus
dΔ
dz = y1(−p y′
2 −qy2) −y2(−p y′
1 −qy1),
which reduces to
dΔ
dz = −pΔ.

GREEN’S FUNCTIONS
This is the differential equation that Δ satisfies. The solution can be easily obtained,
Δ = (constant)e−∫pdz,
or
f(z)Δ = constant.
(5.78)
This is a very important and useful relationship. This shows that whatever y1 and
y2 are, f(z)Δ(y1, y2) is always constant and independent of z. This property was used
to obtain (5.73). Since this relationship (5.78) holds for any z, the constant D =
f(z)Δ(y1, y2) can be determined by choosing any convenient z.
As an example, let us consider the one-dimensional problem we discussed in
Section 5.4.
(
d2
dz2 + k2
)
G(z, z′) = −δ(z −z′),
G(0, z′) = G(a, z′) = 0.
(5.79)
We let
y1 = sin k(a −z),
y2 = sin kz,
where the constants in front of these functions are immaterial.
Now we know that the Wronskian must be constant. To find this constant, we see
that
Δ(y1, y2) = k sin k(a −z) cos kz + k cos k(a −z) sin kz.
If we expand sine and cosine terms, all terms containing z cancel out, and the result
is a constant. But it is not necessary to do this. Since we know that Δ is constant, we
can simply choose any appropriate z. Choosing z = 0, we immediately obtain
Δ(y1, y2) = k sin ka,
and we can write down the results immediately.

(5.80)
Equation (5.80) is identical to (5.43), but these are two different representations of
the same Green’s function.

FOURIER TRANSFORM METHOD
155
So far, we have two representations of Green’s function. The representation
in terms of an infinite series of eigenfunctions is valid for the closed region and
applicable to one-, two-, and three-dimensional cases. On the other hand, the repre-
sentation in terms of two solutions of homogeneous differential equations is valid for
both closed and open regions, but it is applicable only to the one-dimensional case.
In addition to the two representations above, there is a method using integral
transforms that will be discussed in Section 5.6. For an actual problem, we combine
these three representations in an appropriate manner.
5.6
FOURIER TRANSFORM METHOD
In addition to the above two methods, Green’s function may be expressed in terms of
a Fourier transform. In this section, we examine this procedure.
As an example, let us consider the following problem:
(
∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂z2 + k2
)
G = −δ(x −x′)δ(z −z′),
(5.81)
and G = 0 at x = 0 and a. Here we start with the Fourier transform of both sides of
the differential equation. We let
g(x, h) = ∫

G(x, z)ejhzdz,
(5.82)
and the inverse Fourier transform yields
G(x, z) = 1

δ(z −z′)ejhzdz = ejhz′,
(5.84)
δ(z −z′) = 1
2π ∫

e−jh(z−z′)dh,
we write (5.81) in the following form:
(
d2
dx2 + k2 −h2
)
g(x, h) = −δ(x −x′)ejhz′.
(5.85)

This is solved by noting that G = 0 at x = 0 and x = a, we get
g(x, h) =

n −k2 + h2 ejhz′,
(5.86)
where

∑
n=1

(5.87)
Alternatively, we can solve (5.85) using the solutions of the homogeneous equa-
tion. We get
g(x, h) = y1(x>)y2(x<)
D
ejhz′,
where y1(x) = sin p(a – x), y2(x) = sin px, p = (k2– h2)1/2, and D = p sin pa.
We, therefore, get
G(x, z; x′, z′) = 1
2π ∫
∞
−∞
sin px′ sin p(a −x)
p sin pa
e−jh(z−z′)dh,
x > x′,
(5.88)
where p = (k2 – h2)1/2 and for x< x′, x and x′ are interchanged. Equation (5.88) is an
alternative expression for Green’s function (5.87).
We can still obtain another form of Green’s function by first expanding G in a
series of eigenfunctions ϕn(x)
G =

n=1
ϕn(x)ϕn(x′)Gn(z, z′).

We then get

Gn(z, z′) = −δ(z −z′).

for the two different regions. In the range ρ > ρ′, the solution should be an outgoing
wave to satisfy the radiation condition. Thus
y1(ρ) = H(2)
n (qρ)
for ρ > ρ′,
q = (k2 −h2)1∕2.
(5.111)
In the range a < ρ < ρ′, the solution should be a linear combination of two independent
Bessel functions because here the wave travels back and forth forming a standing
wave. Two independent functions can be Jn(qρ) and Nn(qρ), for example. But here
we choose Jn(qρ) and H(2)
n (qρ). The reason for this choice is explained later. Thus
y2(ρ) = AJn(qρ) + BH(2)
n (qρ)
for a < ρ < ρ′.
(5.112)
Using the boundary condition that G = 0 at ρ = a, the ratio of the constants A to B is
determined, and we obtain
y2(ρ) = Jn(qρ) + H(2)
n (qa) −Jn(qa)H(2)
n (qρ).
(5.113)
To find the Wronskian of y1 and y2, we note that the second term of y2(ρ) has
the same form as y1(ρ), and they are dependent. The Wronskian between them is,
therefore, zero. Thus we get
Δ(y1y2) = H(2)
n (qa)qΔ(H(2)
n (x), Jn(x)),
where q is due to the fact that the derivative is with respect to ρ for Δ(y1, y2), but it
is with respect to x for Δ(Hn(x), Jn(x)). Now consider
Δ(H(2)
n (x), Jn(x)).
Jn(x) is written as
Jn(x) = 1
2(H(1)
n (x) + H(2)
n (x)).
Noting that Δ(H(2)
n (x), H(2)
n (x)) = 0, we get
Δ(H(2)
n (x), Jn(x)) = 1
2Δ(H(2)
n (x), H(1)
n (x)).
To evaluate the last Wronskian, we first note that fΔ should be constant. f(x) in
this cylindrical case is simply x, and therefore Wronskian Δ should be equal to

Let us first recognize that Green’s function G consists of the primary wave Gp and
the scattered wave Gs. The primary wave Gp is Green’s function in free space in the
absence of the sphere and Gs represents the effect of the sphere. Let us first find Gp.
This is simply given by Gp = exp(−jk|̄r −̄r′|)∕4π|̄r −̄r′|. However, to satisfy the

CHAPTER 6
RADIATION FROM APERTURES AND
BEAM WAVES
In Chapter 5, we discussed Green’s functions and their representations for differ-
ent problems. In this chapter, we make use of Green’s functions and apply them
to obtain the waves radiated from apertures. We also discuss the spectral domain
method applied to beam-wave propagation, the Goos–Hanchen shift, and higher-
order beam waves (Tamir and Blok, 1986). Electromagnetic aperture problems are
then discussed, including the Stratton–Chu formula, the equivalence theorem, and
Kirchhoff approximation.
6.1
HUYGENS’ PRINCIPLE AND EXTINCTION THEOREM
According to Huygens’ principle, the field at a point is the superposition of the
spherical wavelets originating from a surface located between the observation point
and the source (Fig. 6.1). In this section, we discuss the mathematical formulation of
Huygens’ principle for scalar waves.
Let us consider the field ψ(̄r) generated by the source f(̄r) located in the volume
Vf surrounded by the surface Sf (Fig. 6.2)
(∇2 + k2)ψ(̄r) = −f(̄r).
(6.1)
Let us now apply Green’s theorem to the volume V1 surrounded by S, S∞, and S1.
The surface S is arbitrary, and S∞is the surface at infinity. The surface S1 is the

surface of a small sphere centered at ̄r with radius ε, and ̄r will be identified later as
the observation point. This procedure of using S1 may appear complicated, but it is
necessary while we consider the case when ̄r is on the surface.
Let us apply Green’s theorem to V1.
∫V1

(

∂n −v∂u

(6.2)
where St = S + S∞+ S1, and ∂/∂n is the derivative in the outward normal direction.
We first let ̄r′ denote the integration point and let ∂/∂n′ be the normal derivative “into”
the volume V1 rather than “outward.” We then let
u(̄r′) = ψ(̄r′),
v(̄r′) = G(̄r′, ̄r) = G(̄r, ̄r′) = Green’s function.
(6.3)
Now the source point ̄r for Green’s function is inside S1, and therefore it is outside
the volume V1. Thus ψ and G satisfy (6.1) and the homogeneous wave equation in
V1, respectively.

where ∇′2 is the Laplacian with respect to ̄r′. Now we have
ψ∇′2G −G∇′2ψ = ψ(∇′2 + k2)G −G(∇′2 + k2)ψ = Gf
in V1.
Therefore, (6.2) becomes, noting that ∂/∂n = –∂/∂n′,
ψ𝑖(̄r) = −∫St
[
ψ(̄r′)∂G (̄r, ̄r′)
∂n′

dS′,
(6.5)
where ψ𝑖(̄r) = ∫Vf G(̄r, ̄r′)f(̄r′) dV′.
Now we consider the integral for each surface, S∞, S1, and S. The field at infinity
on S∞is an outgoing spherical wave with propagation constant k, and since k in
any physical medium has some small negative imaginary part, the integral on S∞
vanishes. This is called the radiation condition and is expressed by
lim
r→∞r
( ∂
∂r + jk
)
ψ(̄r) = 0.
(6.6)
Next consider the integral on S1. We note that G(̄r, ̄r′) has a singularity at ̄r = ̄r′, and
we can write
G(̄r, ̄r′) = e−jkε
4πε + G1(̄r′),
where ε = |̄r −̄r′| and G1 has no singularity at ̄r = ̄r′ and is regular. We then get
lim

dS′ = lim

(6.7)
Also, we have
lim
ε→0 ∫S1
G(̄r, ̄r′)∂ψ(̄r′)
∂n′
dS′ = 0.
(6.8)
Therefore, the integration on S1 is equal to −ψ(̄r). Equation (6.5) then becomes
ψ𝑖(̄r) + ∫S
[
ψ(̄r′)∂G(̄r, ̄r′)
∂n′
−G(̄r, ̄r′)∂ψ(̄r′)
∂n′
]
dS′ = ψ(̄r),
if ̄r is outside S,
(6.9)
where the field ψ and ∂ψ/∂n′ are evaluated as ̄r′ approaches the surface from outside.
The field ψ𝑖(̄r) is given by (6.5). It is the field in the absence of the surface S and is
equal to the incident field. At this point, we have not imposed any boundary condi-
tions on Green’s function. The most common choice for G is simply the free-space
Green’s function G(̄r, ̄r′) = G0(̄r, ̄r′) = exp(−jk|̄r −̄r′|)∕(4π|̄r −̄r′|). Other choices
are discussed later. Equation (6.9) gives the fundamental expression for the field ψ(̄r)
outside the object consisting of the incident field ψ𝑖(̄r) and the scattered field ψs(̄r),
which is the contribution from the field on the surface S.

Next, we consider the case when the observation point ̄r approaches the surface S
from outside (Fig. 6.3). We then consider the semispherical surface S2 as shown. Then,
considering that the normal direction ̂n′ for S2 is opposite to the normal direction ̂n′
for S1 on the semisphere, we get

FIELDS DUE TO THE SURFACE FIELD DISTRIBUTION
173
The three equations (6.9), (6.11), and (6.12) are the fundamental equations that
are important and useful for the formulation of many problems. They are the basis
for constructing the surface integral equations, as we discuss in later sections. In
this section, however, we consider the physical meaning of (6.12). It states that
inside the surface S, the incident field ψ𝑖(̄r) and the contribution from the surface
field combine to produce the null field. The incident field ψ𝑖(̄r) inside the surface
is therefore “extinguished” by the surface contribution. For this reason, (6.12) is
called the extinction theorem, the Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem, or the null field
theorem. This theorem can be used as a boundary condition to obtain an extended
integral equation, as will be shown later, and this method is called the extended
boundary condition method or the T-matrix method.
Let us next apply the extinction theorem to a special case when there is no object
inside S. The field everywhere is the incident wave ψ𝑖(̄r) itself. We then write the
extinction theorem as follows:
ψ𝑖(̄r) = ∫S
[
ψ𝑖(̄r′) ∂G0(̄r, ̄r′)
∂n
−G0(̄r, ̄r′) ∂ψ𝑖(̄r′)
∂n
]
dS′,
(6.13)
where G0(̄r, ̄r′) = exp(−k|̄r −̄r′|)∕(4π|̄r −̄r′|) is a free-space Green’s function and
∂/∂n is now taken as the normal derivative pointed inside S. Equation (6.13) shows
that the field at ̄r can be calculated by knowing the field ψ and ∂ψ/∂n on a surface
S, which act as the secondary source for spherical waves. This is the mathematical
statement of Huygens’ principle.
We note that the three fundamental equations (6.9), (6.11), and (6.12) are valid for
two-dimensional problems (∂/∂z = 0) where Green’s function is the two-dimensional
Green’s function G0(̄r, ̄r′) = −(j∕4)H(2)
0 (k|̄r −̄r′|), ̄r = x̂x + ŷy, ̄r′ = x′̂x + y′̂y, and
the surface integral is replaced by the line integral.
6.2
FIELDS DUE TO THE SURFACE FIELD DISTRIBUTION
In Section 6.1, we obtained the scalar field ψ(̄r) in (6.9) when ̄r is outside the surface
S. The field ψ(̄r) consists of the incident field ψ𝑖(̄r) and the field ψs(̄r) scattered from
the surface S.
ψ(̄r) = ψ𝑖(̄r) + ψs(̄r),
ψs(̄r) = ∫S
[
ψ(̄r′) ∂G(̄r, ̄r′)
∂n′
−G(̄r, ̄r′) ∂ψ(̄r′)
∂n′
]
dS′.
(6.14)
To derive this we used Green’s function G(̄r, ̄r′) which has a singularity at ̄r = ̄r′ and
satisfies the equation
(∇2 + k2)G(̄r, ̄r′) = −δ(̄r −̄r′).
(6.15)
However, we have not imposed any boundary conditions on G.
www.ebook3000.com

174
RADIATION FROM APERTURES AND BEAM WAVES
The simplest Green’s function is the free-space Green’s function
G(̄r, ̄r′) = G0(̄r, ̄r′) = exp(−jk ||̄r, ̄r′||)
4π |̄r −̄r′|
.
(6.16)
With the free-space Green’s function, the scattered field is calculated if both ψ and
∂ψ/∂n′ are known on the surface.
ψs(̄r) = ∫S
[
ψ(̄r′) ∂G0(̄r, ̄r′)
∂n′
−G0(̄r, ̄r′) ∂ψ(̄r′)
∂n′
]
dS′.
(6.17)
This is called the Helmholtz–Kirchhoff formula. It should, however, be recognized
that it is not necessary to know both ψ and ∂ψ/∂n on the surface, because according
to the uniqueness theorem (Section 2.10), if the field ψ (or ∂ψ/∂n) is known on the
surface, the field should be uniquely determined everywhere outside the surface.
To obtain the expression for ψs in terms of the surface field only, we use Green’s
function G1(̄r, ̄r′), which satisfies the boundary condition
G1(̄r, ̄r′) = 0
when ̄r′ is on S.
(6.18)
We then get
ψs(̄r) = ∫S
ψ(̄r′)
∂
∂n′ G1(̄r, ̄r′) dS′.
(6.19)
We can also obtain the field ψs(̄r) in terms of ∂ψ/∂n′ on the surface using G2(̄r, ̄r′),
which satisfies Neumann’s boundary condition on S.
∂
∂n′ G2(̄r, ̄r′) = 0
when ̄r′ is on S.
(6.20)
Then we get
ψs(̄r) = −∫S
G2(̄r, ̄r′) ∂ψ(̄r′)
∂n′
dS′.
(6.21)
The three equations (6.17), (6.19), and (6.21) are exact and should yield the
identical exact field ψs(̄r). In practice, however, the exact field may not be known on
S, and therefore, one of them may be preferred, depending on the problems.
Consider a field ψs(̄r) behind a plane screen with an aperture where the field is
given (Fig. 6.5). The field ψs(̄r) can be expressed using the preceding three formulas.
Let us first find Green’s function that satisfies Dirichlet’s condition on the screen.
Green’s function in this case is easily found to be the difference between free-space
Green’s function due to ̄r′ and its image position ̄r′′ (Fig. 6.6).

plane screen. We have
G2(̄r, ̄r′) = e−jkr1

Equations (6.25) and (6.26) are applicable when the aperture field is known on a
plane surface. Equation (6.28) can be used when the normal derivative of the field is
known on a plane surface. When both the field and its normal derivative are known,
we can use (6.17).
6.3
KIRCHHOFF APPROXIMATION
In (6.17), we showed that if the field and its normal derivative are known on a surface,
the field at any point can be calculated. However, the exact evaluation of the field on
a surface, such as the aperture field on a screen (Fig. 6.5), is difficult and requires

KIRCHHOFF APPROXIMATION
177
solution of the complete boundary value problem. If the aperture size is large in terms
of wavelength, the aperture field may be approximately equal to that of the incident
field. This is called the Kirchhoff approximation and can be stated mathematically as
follows.
On the aperture A (Fig. 6.5), we assume that
ψ = ψ𝑖
and
∂ψ
∂n = ∂ψ𝑖
∂n .
(6.29)
On the screen S, we assume that
ψ = 0
and
∂ψ
∂n = 0.
(6.30)
Making use of (6.23), we get the Kirchhoff approximation for the aperture problem
shown in Fig. 6.5.
ψ(̄r) = ∫S
[
ψ𝑖(̄r′)
(
jk + 1
R
) z
R −∂ψ𝑖
∂n′
] exp(−jkR)
4πR
dS′.
(6.31)
For example, if the incident field is a plane wave propagating in the ̂s direction
and the aperture is in the plane z = 0 (Fig. 6.5), we have
ψ𝑖(̄r′) = A0 e−jk̂s⋅̄r′,
∂ψ𝑖(̄r′)
∂n′
= −jk̂s ⋅̂z A0 e−jk̂s⋅̄r′.
(6.32)
If we consider the field at a large distance from the aperture, we can neglect 1/R in
(jk + 1/R), let z/R be cos θ, and 1/R = 1/R0. The phase kR cannot be equated to kR0,
however, as we need to consider the difference in R and R0 in terms of wavelength.
We then should use R = R0 −̄r′ ⋅̂o. Finally, we get the field far from the aperture
ψ(̄r) = exp(−jkR0)
4πR0
∫S
jkψ𝑖(̄r′)(cos θ + ̂s ⋅̂z)ejk̄r′⋅̄o dS′.
(6.33)
The Kirchhoff approximation can be applied to the problem of scattering from an
object (Fig. 6.7). At ̄r′, we assume that the field is approximately equal to the field if
the surface is plane and tangential to the surface at ̄r′. If the incident field is a plane
wave propagating in the ̂s direction, we have
ψ𝑖= A0 exp(−jk̂s ⋅̄r).

(6.35)
In the shadow region, we assume that
ψ = 0
and
∂ψ
∂n′ = 0.
(6.36)
Equations (6.34)–(6.36) are then substituted in (6.17) to obtain the Kirchhoff approx-
imation. Since we use the approximation that the field at any point on the surface
is equal to the field for a plane tangent to the surface, we sometimes call this the
tangent approximation. Electromagnetic equivalent of this approximation is called
the physical optics approximation.
6.4
FRESNEL AND FRAUNHOFER DIFFRACTION
Let us next consider the field u at ̄r where the field u0(̄r′) is given on the aperture at
z = 0 (Fig. 6.8). This is given in (6.25). Consider an observation point (x, y, z) and
let r0 be the distance from the origin x′ = y′ = 0 of the aperture. Then we assume
that kr ≫1, z/r ≈1, and 1/r ≈1/r0. The phase kr cannot be approximated by
kr0 since the difference can be of the order of wavelengths. We use the following
approximation:

(6.39)
and note that kx′2/z < 1 at a large distance z, we can approximate r by

(6.40)

(6.41)
Note the difference between the Fresnel diffraction formula (6.38) and the Fraunhofer
diffraction formula (6.41). The Fresnel formula contains the quadratic terms in x′ and
y′ and is applicable to the near field of the aperture z < a2/λ, while the Fraunhofer
formula contains only the linear terms in x′ and y′ and is applicable to the far field
z ≫a2/λ, where a is the aperture size. We also note that (6.41) is in a form of
Fourier transform, and therefore we can state that the Fraunhofer field is the Fourier
transform of the aperture field. In antenna theory, we state that the radiation pattern
of the aperture antenna is the Fourier transform of the aperture field.

Let us consider the Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius a with
constant field
u0(x′, y′) =

(6.42)
Then from (6.41), letting

(6.46)
The angle θa of the first zero of u(r0, θ) is given by
ka sin θa = 3.832
or
sin θa = 0.610λ∕a.
(6.47)
The diffraction pattern (6.46) is called the Airy pattern and the main lobe in 0 ≤θ ≤
θa is called the Airy disk.

(6.50)
The field in (6.49) is then given by
U(Z) = j2A0e−jkzF(Z1)F(Z2),
(6.51)
where Z1 = (k∕πz)1∕2a and Z2 = (k∕πz)1∕2b.
Let us consider one more example of Fresnel diffraction. Consider a circular
aperture on which the field has the field distribution A0(x′, y′) with the quadratic
phase front with the radius of curvature R0 at z = 0.
U0(x′, y′) = A0(x′, y′) exp
[
+jk(x′2 + y′2)

]
.
(6.52)
The phase distribution above focuses the wave at z = R0 since the wave propagated
from (x′, y′) to (x = 0, y = 0, z = R0) has the phase given by
exp(−jkR) = exp
[
−jk
(

≃exp
[

and the quadratic phase distribution in (6.52) exactly compensates for the quadratic
term in exp(–jkR). We substitute (6.52) into (6.38). If we consider the field at the
focal plane z = R0, we get
U(x, y, z) = jk

This is identical to (6.41) for Fraunhofer diffraction. If A0 is constant, we get (6.46),
where sin θ = (x2 + y2)1/2/R0.
This last example shows that if the aperture field has the quadratic phase distribu-
tion such that the wave is focused at z = R0, the field distribution at the focal plane
z = R0 is identical to the Fraunhofer diffraction. We can also state that the field at the
focal plane is the Fourier transform of the aperture field. This fact is often used in
optical signal processing when Fourier transform is needed.
6.5
FOURIER TRANSFORM (SPECTRAL) REPRESENTATION
Let us consider a scalar wave u(x, y, z) generated by the field u0(x′, y′) at the plane
z = 0. There are two ways to obtain u(x, y, z) from u0(x′, y′). One is to find Green’s
function, that is the field at u(x, y, z) due to a delta function at (x′, y′), and then to
multiply it with u0(x′, y′) and integrate over the aperture at z = 0. This is similar to
finding the output voltage of a network due to an input by using the impulse response,
and was used in Section 6.4. The other method is the Fourier transform technique.
The Fourier transform of the aperture field u0(x′, y′) is first taken, multiplied by the
transfer function, and then the inverse Fourier transform is taken to produce u(x, y,
z). This is similar to solving the network problem by using the frequency spectrum
of the input, multiplying it by the transfer function, and taking the inverse transform
to obtain the output. We first discuss the Fourier transform technique in this section.
Let us start with the scalar wave equation,
(∇2 + k2)u (̄r) = 0.
(6.54)
We first take a Fourier transform in x and y
U(q1, q2, z) = ∬
u(x, y, z)ejq1 x+jq2 y dx dy.
(6.55)
We then get
(
d2
dz2 + k2 −q2
1 −q2
2
)
U(q1, q2, z) = 0.
(6.56)
The general solution of this consists of two waves traveling in the +z and –z directions,
respectively.
U(q1, q2, z) = A+(q1, q2)e−jqz + A−(q1, q2)e+jqz,
(6.57)

BEAM WAVES
183
Note that for a positive-going wave with exp(–jqz), q = qr + jqi must be in the fourth
quadrant in the complex plane (qr ≥0 and qi ≤0), because exp(–jqz) = exp(–jqrz +
qiz) must decay exponentially as z →+∞. The same condition also ensures that the
negative-going wave exp(+jqz) decays exponentially as z →–∞.
Let us consider the wave propagating in the +z direction in the region z ≥0, with
A– = 0. Taking the inverse Fourier transform, we get
u(x, y, z) =
1
(2π)2 ∬A+(q1, q2)e−jq1x−jq2y−jqz dq1 dq2.
(6.58)
The function A+(q1, q2) can be given by letting u(x′, y′, z) = u0(x′, y′) at z = 0 in
(6.58). We then get
A+(q1, q2) = ∬
u0(x′, y′)ejq1x′+jq2y′ dx′ dy′.
(6.59)
Equations (6.58) and (6.59) therefore give the field at an arbitrary point (x, y, z) due
to the given field u0 at the plane z = 0.
6.6
BEAM WAVES
As an example of the spectral method described in Section 6.5, we discuss an impor-
tant class of waves called beam waves. Typical examples are a laser beam and a beam
of millimeter wave propagating in the atmosphere. The characteristics of a beam
wave are also exhibited in the near field in front of a parabolic reflector antenna, lens
waveguides, and open resonator (laser resonator) (see Fig. 6.9).
Equation (6.58) is exact, but further simplification is possible for a beam wave.
If the wave is assumed to be propagating mostly in the z direction, as in the case
of a beam wave, the propagation constants q1 and q2 in the x and y directions are
much smaller than the propagation constant q in the z direction. Therefore, the major
contribution to the Fourier integral in (6.58) comes from the region where |q| is close
to k and |q1| and |q2| are much smaller than k. Thus, we make the following paraxial
approximation for q:
q = (k2 −q2

)1∕2
≃k −
q2
1 + q2

2k

(6.60)
We now make use of the paraxial approximation (6.60) to obtain the expres-
sion for a beam wave. Let us assume that the field at z = 0 has the Gaussian
amplitude distribution and the quadratic phase front with the radius of curvature R0
(Fig. 6.10).

If the radius of curvature R0 is positive, the beam is focused, if R0 is infinite, the
beam is collimated, and if R0 is negative, the beam is diverging (Fig. 6.10). Let us

is called the beam spot size and is obtained from (6.67).

(6.69)
The beam spot size Ws becomes smaller as the original beam size W0 increases for
given λ and R0. This relationship (6.69) may be viewed by examining the Fresnel
numbers Nf. At a given distance z from the center of the aperture of width W0, the
difference between the distance to the edge of the aperture and the distance to the
center may be measured as the multiple of a half-wavelength (Fig. 6.11). The number
of the multiple is the Fresnel number Nf.

GOOS–HANCHEN EFFECT
When a beam wave is incident on a plane boundary, the transmission and reflection
normally take place. If a beam wave is incident from a dense medium on a less
dense medium, total reflection takes place if the angle of incidence is greater than
the critical angle. When this happens, it is noted that the reflected beam is shifted
in space and this is called the Goos–Hanchen shift. This phenomenon gives some
interesting physical insight into the total reflection mechanism.

Let us consider a beam wave incident on a plane boundary as shown in Fig. 6.12.
To simplify the analysis, we consider a two-dimensional (∂/∂y = 0) problem. The
incident beam wave ui(x′, z′) is collimated with amplitude distribution A (x′)
u𝑖(x′, z′) = A(x′)exp(−jk1z′).
(6.74)
We then use the coordinate transformation from (x′, z′) to (x, z)
x′ = x cos θ0 + (z −h) sin θ0,
z′ = x sin θ0 −(z −h) cos θ0.
(6.75)
The incident field at z = h is, therefore, given by
u𝑖(x, h) = A(x cos θ0)exp(−jβ0x),
(6.76)
where β0 = k1 sin θ0.
We take a Fourier transform of (6.76)
U(β −β0) = ∫u𝑖(x, h)ejβx dx
= ∫A (x cos θ0)ej(β−β0)x dx.
(6.77)
The incident field ui(x, z) satisfies the wave equation
(

∂x2 + ∂2
∂z2 + k2

)
u𝑖(x, z) = 0.
(6.78)

Taking the Fourier transform in the x direction and letting ui(x, z) be equal to (6.76)
at z = h, we obtain
u𝑖(x, z) = 1
2π ∫U(β −β0) exp[−jβx + jq(z −h)] dβ,
(6.79)
where q = (k2
1 −β2)1∕2. Note that the incident wave ui consists of the spectrum
U(β – β0) centered at β0. For example, if ui is a Gaussian beam, we have

(6.80)
The wave number β in the x direction extends from –∞to +∞. The range –k1 < β <
k1 corresponds to the plane wave with real angle θi of incidence β = k1 sin θi(–π/2 <
θi < π/2). However, the range β > k1 corresponds to the complex angle of incidence
θi = π/2 + jθ′′, 0 ≤θ′′ ≤∞, and the range β < –k1 corresponds to θi = –π/2 – jθ′′,
0 ≤θ′′ ≤∞. These ranges |β| > k1 represent the evanescent wave. In general, the
finite beam or the wave from a localized source excites both the propagating |β| < k1
and the evanescent waves |β| > k1.
The reflected wave ur(x, z) can be written as
ur(x, z) = 1
2π ∫R (β) U (β −β0) exp[−j βx −jq(z + h)] d β,
(6.81)
where R(β) is the reflection coefficient to be determined by applying the boundary
condition.
When we apply the boundary condition at z = 0 using (6.79), (6.81), and the
transmitted wave,
ut(x, z) = 1
2π ∫T (β) U (β −β0)e−jβx+jqt z −jqh d β,
(6.82)
where qt = (k2
2 −β2)1∕2, we obtain the relationship identical to the plane wave case
except that k1 sin θi for a plane wave is replaced by β. Thus, each Fourier component
U(β – β0) behaves as if it is a plane wave with β = k1 sin θi. The difference is that the
Fourier components include all β, both propagating and evanescent waves, while the
plane wave is limited to the real angle of incidence.
If u represents a TE wave in Section 3.4, we get (for μ1 = μ2 = μ0)
R (β) = q −qt
q + qt
,
(6.83)

where q = (k2
1 −β2)1∕2 and qt = (k2
2 −β2)1∕2. If u represents a TM wave in Sec-
tion 3.5, we get
R (β) =
(qt∕n2

) −(q∕n2
1
)
(qt∕n2
2
) + (q∕n2

).
(6.84)
If u represents an acoustic wave in Section 3.8,
R (β) = (ρ2∕qt) −(ρ1∕q)
(ρ2∕qt) + (ρ1∕q).
(6.85)
Let us examine the reflected field (6.81). First, we note that for a beam wave,
U(β – β0) has a peak at β = β0 and decays away from β = β0, as seen in (6.80). If
the beam width W0 is many wavelengths wide, U is very much concentrated near
β = β0. If the reflection coefficient R(β) is a slowly varying function of β, then as a
first approximation, we can let R (β) ∼R (β0). We then get from (6.81) the reflected
wave that is equal to the beam wave ur0(x, z) originated at the image point z = –h
except for the reflection coefficient.
ur(x, z) ∼R (β0)ur0(x, z),
ur0(x, z) = 1
2π ∫U(β −β0) exp[−j βx −jq(z + h)] d β.
(6.86)
The approximation R(β) ≈R(β0) is no longer valid, however, when the angle
of incidence θ0 and n1 and n2 are such that the total reflection takes place, sin
θ0 > (n2/n1). Then, the beam is not only totally reflected, but the reflected beam
is shifted in space because of the additional phase in the reflection coefficient.
As an example, consider the TE wave (6.83). Since in the neighborhood of β ≈
β0, qt = (k2
2 −β2)1∕2 ∼k(n2
2 −n2
1 sin2 θ0)1∕2 ∼−jk(n2
1 sin2 θ0 −n2
2)1∕2, we let qt =
−j αt. Then, we write
R (β) = q −qt
q + qt
= q + j αt
q −j αt
= exp[j ϕ(β)],
(6.87)
where ϕ(β) = 2 tan–1(αt/q). Since the major contribution to the integral (6.81) comes
from the neighborhood of β = β0, we expand ϕ(β) in Taylor’s series about β0 and
keep the first two terms.
ϕ(β) = ϕ(β0) + (β −β0)ϕ′(β0).
(6.88)
Substituting (6.87) and (6.88) into (6.81), we get
ur(x, z) = R (β0)e−jβ0 ϕ′(β0)ur0(x −ϕ′(β0), z)
(6.89)

HIGHER-ORDER BEAM-WAVE MODES

Caustic
FIGURE 6.13
Caustic when the beam wave is incident at an angle close to the critical angle.
This shows that the reflected beam ur(x, z) is proportional to the beam ur0 from the
image point with the lateral shift of Δ = ϕ′(β0) (Fig. 6.12). This shift Δ is called the
Goos–Hanchen effect and it becomes greater the closer the incident angle θ0 becomes
to the critical angle sin–1(n2/n1). As θ0 approaches the critical angle, the first-order
approximation (6.88) becomes insufficient, and in the neighborhood of the critical
angle, the reflected rays form a caustic (Fig. 6.13).
6.8
HIGHER-ORDER BEAM-WAVE MODES
In Sections 6.6 and 6.7, we discussed a beam whose amplitude distribution is Gaus-
sian. This is the most important practical beam wave. However, this constitutes the
fundamental beam-wave mode, and there are an infinite number of higher-order
beam-wave modes in addition to the fundamental mode. To investigate these higher-
order modes, it is convenient to start with the parabolic approximation to the wave
equation. Consider the field u(x, y, z) that satisfies the wave equation
(∇2 + k2)u (x, y, z) = 0.
(6.90)
For a beam wave, the field is mostly propagating in the z direction, and thus we write
u (x, y, z) = U (x, y, z) e−jkz.
(6.91)
The function U should be a slowly varying function of z. Substituting (6.91) into
(6.90), and noting that
∇u = (∇U)e−jkz −jk̂z Ue−jkz,
∇2 u =
(
∇2 U −j2k ∂
∂z U −k2 U
)
e−jkz,
we get
(
∇2 −j2k ∂
∂z
)
U = 0.

U = 0,
(6.94)
where ∇2
t is the Laplacian in x and y (transverse to ̂z). This is the parabolic
approximation to the wave equation (6.92) and greatly simplifies the mathematical
analysis for a beam wave. This parabolic approximation is equivalent to the paraxial
approximation (6.60).
Since (6.94) is identical to the paraxial approximation, it is easy to show that the

VECTOR GREEN’S THEOREM, STRATTON–CHU FORMULA, AND
FRANZ FORMULA
We have discussed scalar Green’s theorem in Section 6.1. In this section, we consider
the equivalent theorem for vector fields. Let us consider the vector fields ̄P(̄r) and
̄Q(̄r) in the volume V surrounded by the surface S. We assume that ̄P and ̄Q and
their first and second derivatives are continuous in V and on S. Using the divergence
theorem, we have
∫V
∇⋅(̄P × ∇× Q) dV = ∫S
̄P × ∇× Q ⋅dS.
(6.105)
We now use the identity
∇⋅(A × B) = B ⋅∇× A −A ⋅∇× B.
(6.106)
Letting A = P and B = ∇× Q, we get the vector Green’s first identity
∫V
(∇× ̄Q ⋅∇× ̄P −̄P ⋅∇× ∇× ̄Q) dV = ∫S
̄P × ∇× ̄Q ⋅d̄S.
(6.107)
To get the second identity or Green’s theorem, we interchange ̄P and ̄Q in (6.107).
∫V
(∇× ̄P ⋅∇× ̄Q −̄Q ⋅∇× ∇× ̄P) dV = ∫S
̄Q × ∇× ̄P ⋅d̄S.

(6.109)
The vector Green’s theorem developed above is now applied to the electromagnetic
field problem. We consider the scattering problem discussed in Section 6.1. The
electromagnetic fields ̄E𝑖and ̄H𝑖are incident on a body with the volume V surrounded
by the surface S (Fig. 6.15). The Stratton–Chu formula can be stated for the following
three cases.
1. When the observation point ̄r is outside the surface S,
̄E𝑖(̄r) + ∫S
̄EsdS′ = ̄E(̄r),
̄H𝑖(̄r) + ∫S

G(̄r −̄r′) = exp(−jk | ̄r −̄r′|)∕(4π | ̄r −̄r′ |) is the scalar free-space Green’s func-
tion, and ∇′ is the gradient with respect to ̄r′. The surface integral in (6.111) is the
Cauchy principal value of the integral, and the fields ̄E(̄r′) and ̄H(̄r′) are those as ̄r′
approaches S from outside.
Equation (6.111) will be used later to construct an electric field integral equation
(EFIE) and a magnetic field integral equation (MFIE). Equation (6.112) is the vector
extinction theorem, also called the vector Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem or the
vector null field theorem. Inside the surface S, the incident fields ̄E𝑖and ̄H𝑖are
extinguished by the contribution from the surface fields. Proof of formula (6.113) is
given in Appendix 6.A.
In addition to the Stratton–Chu formula, there are other equivalent representations
of the electromagnetic field. Consider the field ̄E(̄r) and ̄H(̄r) outside the surface S
and the volume V (Fig. 6.16). The Stratton–Chu formula is given by
̄E(̄r) = ̄E𝑖(̄r) + ∫S

6.10
EQUIVALENCE THEOREM
In Section 6.9, we discussed the Stratton–Chu formula and its equivalent Franz
formula. According to the Franz formula, the field outside the surface S is given by
the incident field and the surface integral of the tangential electric field ̂n′ × ̄E and
the tangential magnetic field ̂n′ × ̄H. Inside the surface S, the field is zero as shown
in the extinction theorem. Since the surface S is arbitrary, we can state that the actual
field outside the surface S is identical to the field generated by the equivalent surface
magnetic current ̄Jms = ̄E × ̂n′ and the equivalent surface electric current ̄Js = ̂n′ × ̄H.
These fictitious currents ̄Jms and ̄Js on S produce a field identical to the original field
outside S, but they extinguish the field inside S, producing the null field (Harrington,
1968, Chapter 3) (Fig. 6.17).
In the above we used both ̄Js and ̄Jms on the surface. However, according to the
uniqueness theorem, if we specify either ̄Js or ̄Jms on S, the field outside S is uniquely
determined, and therefore we may use ̄Js or ̄Jms. For example, consider a conducting
body with the aperture A on its surface S. The tangential electric field over the aperture
is ̄E × ̂n′. As far as the field outside S is concerned, the field is identical to the field
produced by the conducting body with the aperture closed, but with the magnetic
surface current ̄Jms = ̄E × ̂n′ placed in front of the original location of the aperture

6.11
KIRCHHOFF APPROXIMATION FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC
WAVES
In Section 6.3, we discussed the Kirchhoff approximation for the scalar field. The
electromagnetic Kirchhoff approximation can be obtained using the same technique.
Let us consider a large aperture on a screen. According to the Kirchhoff approxima-
tion, we assume that the electric and magnetic fields tangential to the aperture are
equal to those of the incident field.
̂n′ × ̄H = ̂n′ × ̄H𝑖,
̄E × ̂n′ = ̄E𝑖× ̄n′.
(6.117)
Then using the Franz formula (6.116), we get
̄E(̄r) = ∇× ∇× ̄Π −jωμ∇× ̄Πm,
̄Π =

G = exp(−jk|̄r −̄r′)
4π |̄r −̄r′|
.
(6.118)
Here all the quantities are known, and therefore ̄E(̄r) at any point ̄r can be calculated.
If we consider the field ̄E(̄r) in the far zone of the aperture where |̄r| ≫D2∕λ and
D is the size of the aperture, we can approximate G by the following (Fig. 6.5):
G = exp(−jkR0 + jk̂o ⋅̄r′)
4πR0
.
(6.119)

PROBLEMS
199
Also note that in the far zone, the field is propagating in the direction ̂o and is
thus proportional to exp(−jk̂o ⋅̄r). Since ∇exp(−jk̂o ⋅̄r) = −jk̂o exp( −jk̂o ⋅̄r), the
operator ∇is equal to −jk̂o. Thus we have ∇× ∇× = −k2̂o × ̂o× and ∇× = −jk̂o × .
Also, we consider the components Eθ and Eϕ. Then we finally get the following
Kirchhoff approximation for the radiation field when the incident field ̄E𝑖and ̄H𝑖is
known over the aperture S.

CHAPTER 7
PERIODIC STRUCTURES AND
COUPLED-MODE THEORY
There are many important structures whose characteristics are periodic in space.
Examples are three-dimensional lattice structures for crystals, artificial dielectric
consisting of periodically placed conducting pieces, Yagi antennas that have period-
ically spaced elements, corrugated surfaces, and waveguides with periodic loadings.
In addition, systems of lenses that are placed with equal spacings and open resonators
can be considered periodic structures. Guided waves along these structures exhibit a
unique frequency dependence often characterized by stop bands and pass bands. The
scattered waves from these periodic structures are characterized by grating modes
resulting from periodic interference of waves in different directions. The starting
point in solving the problems of periodic structures is Floquet’s theorem, which is
described in Section 7.1.
In this chapter, we discuss guided waves propagating along a periodic structure,
waves propagating through periodic layers, and plane waves incident on periodic
structures. In discussing these problems, we present integral equation formulations
that are used extensively in many electromagnetic problems. We also discuss a
classical problem of scattering by sinusoidal surfaces and include a short description
of coupled-mode theory.

7.1
FLOQUET’S THEOREM
Let us consider a wave propagating in periodic structures, which may be characterized
by periodic boundary conditions or a periodically varied dielectric constant (Fig. 7.1).
We note that the fields at a point z in an infinite periodic structure differ from the
fields one period L away by a complex constant. This is obviously true because, in an
infinite periodic structure, there should be no difference between the fields at z and at
z + L except for the constant attenuation and phase shift. Let a function u(z) represent
a wave. Then a wave u(z) at z and a wave u(z + L) at z + L are related in the same
manner as a wave u(z + L) at z + L and a wave u(z + 2L) at z + 2L.
Mathematically, we write
u(z + L)
u(z)
= u(z + 2L)
u(z + L) =
u(z + mL)
u[z + (m −1)L] = C = constant.
(7.1)
From this we obtain
u(z + mL) = Cmu(z).
(7.2)
The constant C is in general complex, which we write
C = e−jβL,
β = complex,
(7.3)
and β represents the propagation constant.
Now let us consider a function
R(z) = ejβzu(z).
(7.4)

GUIDED WAVES ALONG PERIODIC STRUCTURES
203
Then R(z + L) = ejβ(z+L) u(z + L) = R(z). Therefore, R(z) is a periodic function of z
with period L, and thus can be represented in a Fourier series.
R(z) =
∞
∑
n=−∞
Ane−j(2nπ∕L)z.
(7.5)
Using (7.4), we finally obtain a general expression for a wave in a periodic structure
with the period L.

waves, we write

(7.7)
This is the representation of a wave in periodic structures in the form of an infinite
series, resembling harmonic representation (e−jωnt) in time. The nth term in (7.6) is
called the nth space harmonic or Hartree harmonic. Equation (7.7) is the mathe-
matical representation of Floquet’s theorem, which states that the wave in periodic
structures consists of an infinite number of space harmonics. In this chapter we con-
sider two cases. One is guided waves along a periodic structure and the other is the
scattering of plane waves from periodic structures.
7.2
GUIDED WAVES ALONG PERIODIC STRUCTURES
Consider a wave propagating along a periodic structure with period L. The positive-
going wave is given by (7.6), and when the wave is propagating, β is real and the
phase velocity is different for each harmonic.
vpn = ω
βn
=

(7.8)
but the group velocity is the same for all harmonics
vgn =

dβ∕dω = vg0.
(7.9)
The propagation constant β is real in some frequency ranges, and this is called the pass
band. The frequency range where β is purely imaginary and the wave is evanescent
is called the stop band.
We now examine the k–β diagram for periodic structures. We first note that if β is
increased by 2π/L, this is equivalent to changing βn to βn+1, and the general expression

for the fields is unaltered. Therefore, k is a periodic function of β with period 2π/L. It
is also clear that since the wave propagation in the +z and the –z direction should have
the same characteristics, k is an even function of β. As an example, the k–β diagram
for a tape helix is shown in Fig. 7.2. The labeling of each mode is usually made to
identify the lowest β with positive slope (vg > 0) by the zeroth mode and the β + 2n
π/L by the nth mode. Similarly, for the mode with negative slopes (vg < 0), –(β + 2n
π/L) is labeled by the nth mode.
As an example, let us consider TM modes propagating along a corrugated surface
(Fig. 7.3). We look for a trapped surface-wave solution. In this section, we employ the
integral equation formulation for the boundary value problem. In the integral equation
formulation, the differential equation and the boundary conditions are combined to
obtain an integral equation. The integral equation contains an unknown function
under an integral operator, just as the differential equation contains an unknown
function under a differential operator. Let us examine this technique for the problem
of a corrugated surface.

In this problem, we first express the magnetic field H1 in the region x > 0 due
to the unknown tangential electric field at x = 0. Next we express the magnetic field
H2 in the region x < 0 due to the “same” tangential electric field at x = 0. Since we
used the same electric field at x = 0, although it is still unknown, we automatically
satisfied the boundary condition that the tangential electric field is continuous at
x = 0. We then satisfy the boundary condition that the tangential magnetic field is
continuous by equating H1 to H2, yielding an integral equation for the unknown
tangential electric field at x = 0.
To follow the foregoing procedure, let us first note that all TM modes are given
by Hy satisfying a scalar wave equation,
(

∂z2 + k2

Hy = 0,
(7.10)
with

and

Next we express H1 for x > 0. According to Floquet’s theorem, we write Hy1 for
x > 0 in a series of space harmonics.
Hy1(x, z) =

∑
n=−∞

Since this must satisfy a wave equation (7.10), fn(x) should have a form fn(x) ≈e±jqnx,
where q2
n + β2
n = k2. Furthermore, this structure is open in the +x direction and Hy
must satisfy the radiation condition as x →+∞, and therefore, fn(x) must have the
form e−jqnx.
Since we are only interested in a trapped slow-wave solution, qn must be purely
imaginary, qn = –jαn. Therefore, we write
Hy1(x, z) =

∑

Ane−αnx−jβnz,
x > 0,
(7.12)
where α2
n = β2
n −k2, and An is the amplitude for each space harmonic.

Next, consider the field inside the slot due to the field f(z) at x = 0. Hy in the slot
should consist of TEM modes and higher-order TM modes. Noting that Ex = 0 at

Equations (7.17) and (7.19) give Hy(x, z) in the region x > 0 and x < 0, respectively,
in terms of the same tangential electric field f(z) in the slot. Now let us consider
the boundary conditions at x = 0, which requires the continuity of tangential electric
and magnetic fields at x = 0. We note that the tangential electric field over the slot
is continuous at x = 0 because we used the same field f(z). The continuity of the
tangential magnetic field requires that (7.17) and (7.19) be equal over the slot at
x = 0. Thus we get
∫

f(z′)G(z, 0; z′, 0) dz′ = 0

2 ,
(7.20)
where G(z, 0; z′, 0) = G1(z, 0; z′, 0) – G2(z, 0; z′, 0).
If we can solve (7.20) for the unknown function f(z′) and the propagation constant
β, all the other fields can be obtained by (7.17) and (7.19). But the analytical solution
of (7.20) is, in general, not available. It is possible to solve (7.20) by a numerical
technique such as the moment method. In this section, however, we are not concerned
with a detailed description of f(z) but are interested in obtaining the propagation
constant β.
In this case, we can obtain a convenient solution by equating the total complex
power at both sides of the slot opening (Fig. 7.4). We note that P1 = P2, where
P1 = ∫

P2 = ∫

β (see Appendix 7.B).

The k–β diagram for this structure is shown in Fig. 7.5.
The choice of f(z) above is made for mathematical convenience. The best choice
would be the one that satisfies the edge condition. The field behavior near the edge
is not arbitrary and it must satisfy a certain condition called the edge condition (see
Appendix 7.C). For example, the electric field normal to the edge with the angle ϕ0
shown in Fig. 7.6 should behave as
Ez ≈

Trapped surface wave
Forbidden region (radiation)
FIGURE 7.7
Forbidden region.
If a periodic structure is open in the transverse direction, the trapped surface wave
can propagate along this structure without attenuation. Since the trapped surface
wave is a slow wave, the wave exists only in the region |β| > k in the k–β diagram.
Recognizing that the diagram is a periodic function of β with period 2π/L, we note
that the trapped surface wave can exist only in a series of triangles in Fig. 7.7.
Outside these triangles, the wave is fast and the energy leaks out of the structure,
resulting in attenuation. This region is called forbidden because the structure cannot
support waves without attenuation. For example, a helix used in traveling-wave tubes
is designed to support the slow wave and obviously should not be operated in the
forbidden region. On the other hand, if the structure is designed as an antenna, the
leakage of the energy represents the radiation, and therefore the characteristics in
this forbidden region are of great interest. Log-periodic antennas can be analyzed in
terms of the behavior of the wave in the forbidden region.
If the structure is closed in the transverse direction, however, a propagating wave
need not be slow, and thus there is no forbidden region. For example, if the corrugated
surface discussed previously is closed (Fig. 7.8), the k–β diagram may appear as
shown. Obviously, an exact diagram depends on the relative sizes of L, W, l, and the
wavelength.

PERIODIC LAYERS
Periodic stratified media are important in many optical and microwave applications.
Let us consider the simplest case of a periodic medium consisting of alternating
layers of two different indices of refraction (Fig. 7.9). We wish to find the propagation
constant of a wave as it propagates through this structure. We first note that in an
infinite periodic structure, there should be no difference between the field U(x) at one
point and the field U(x + d) at another point separated by the period d except for a
constant attenuation and phase shift. Mathematically, we state that
U (x + d) = U (x) exp (−jqd) ,

q = mπ + j (real) corresponding to the evanescent wave, and the frequency range under
this condition is called the stop band. The frequency dependence of the propagation
constant q has the general shape shown in Fig. 7.11. Note that qd = π corresponds to

PLANE WAVE INCIDENCE ON A PERIODIC STRUCTURE
The reflection and transmission of a plane wave incident on periodic structures are of
great importance in many areas of engineering and physics. Examples are microwave
mesh reflectors, optical gratings, and crystal structures. In this section, we outline the
basic approaches to this problem.
Let a periodic structure be located at z = 0 and a plane wave incident on this
surface from the direction defined by (θp, ϕp) (see Fig. 7.12). The incident wave,
whether it is an electric field, magnetic field, or Hertz potential, can be written as
U𝑖= A𝑖e−jkxx−jky+jkzz,
(7.35)
where kx = k sin ϕp cos θp, ky = k sin θp sin ϕp, and kz = k cos θp.
Now the reflected wave Ur should be written in a series of space harmonics in the
x and y directions. Thus at z = 0, we write
Ur =

m=−∞

(7.37)
The determination of Bmn can be made by applying the boundary condi-
tions. Let us note that the propagation constant for each mode in the z direction
βmn = (k2 −k2
xm −k2
yn)1∕2 can be real or purely imaginary depending on the incident
direction (θp, ϕp) and m and n. If βmn is real, the wave propagates away from the
surface carrying real power and is called the grating mode. If βmn is purely imaginary,
the wave does not carry real power away from the surface and is evanescent.
As an example, let us consider a wave incident on a periodic conducting grating as
shown in Fig. 7.13. We assume that the plane of incidence is in the x–z plane and all the
gratings are parallel to the y axis, and therefore this is a two-dimensional problem. For
a TE wave, Ex = Ez = 0 and Ey satisfies the wave equation and Dirichlet’s boundary
condition (Ey = 0) on the conducting tapes. For a TM wave, Hx = Hz = 0 and Hy
satisfies the wave equation and Neumann’s boundary condition on the conducting
tapes.
Let us consider the TM case. The magnetic field Hy in the region z > 0 consists of
the incident wave Hyi, the reflected wave Hyr when the aperture is completely closed,
and the scattered wave Hys generated by the field in the aperture.
Hy𝑖= A0e+jqz−jβx,

Note that Ex = (j/ωε)(∂/∂z)Hy, and therefore Exi + Exr = 0 at z = 0.

Now let us consider the boundary conditions at z = 0. The continuity of the
tangential electric field Ex is already satisfied as we used the same function f(x′). The
continuity of the tangential magnetic field requires that
Hy𝑖+ Hyr + Hys1 = Hys2
at z = 0.

solution (7.45).
Note that far from the surface, all the evanescent modes are negligibly small and
only the propagating modes exist. For the propagating modes, qn is real, and therefore
k > |βn|. This is the forbidden (radiation) region shown in Fig. 7.7.

of the incident wave Eyi, the wave Eyr reflected from the conducting plane at z = 0,
and the wave Eys1 produced by the aperture field at z = 0.

SCATTERING FROM PERIODIC SURFACES BASED ON THE
RAYLEIGH HYPOTHESIS
Let us consider a wave scattered by a sinusoidally varying surface illuminated by
a plane wave (Fig. 7.14). We will consider a two-dimensional problem where the
surface does not vary in the y direction and the plane of incidence is in the x–z plane.
The surface is given by z = ζ,
ζ = −h cos 2πx
L .

This problem was first solved by Rayleigh using what is now called the Rayleigh
hypothesis.

expressed in terms of the outgoing wave with exp(–jqn z) only and the incoming wave
with exp(+jqn z) is not included. Whereas the wave is outgoing in the region above
the highest point of the surface (z > h), the wave in the region – h < z < h should
consist of both the outgoing and incoming waves. The approach that the scattered
wave can be represented by the outgoing wave only, even in the region – h < z < h,
is called the Rayleigh hypothesis. Although the Rayleigh hypothesis is not valid for
a general periodic surface, it has been shown that it is valid for the sinusoidal surface
if the maximum slope of the surface (∂ζ/∂x)max = (2πh)/L is less than 0.448.
Assuming the Rayleigh hypothesis, we apply the boundary condition that ψi +
ψs = 0 on the surface (z = ζ). Noting that exp(–jβx) is common to all terms, we get

(7.64)

SCATTERING FROM PERIODIC SURFACES BASED ON THE RAYLEIGH HYPOTHESIS
221
The relationships among Bn and A0 are obtained by expanding (7.64) in Fourier series
and equating all Fourier coefficients to zero. To do this we multiply (7.64) by exp(j2m
πx/L) and integrate the result over L. Noting that

∑
n=−∞
Bne−j(π∕2)|m−n|J|m−n|(qnh) = 0.
(7.66)
This may be arranged in the following matrix form:
[Kmn][Bn] = [Am]A0,
(7.67)
where
Kmn = e−j(π∕2)|m−n|J|m−n|(qnh),
Am = −e−j(π∕2)|m|J|m|(qh).
It can be truncated and [Bn] may be obtained by [K]–1[A]A0. For example, if the
height is small compared with a wavelength and the period L is much greater than a
wavelength, qh ≪1 and |qn h| ≫1 for propagating modes, and therefore, Jm–n(qn
h) is of the order of |qn h|m–n and the matrix can be truncated without too much
error. The conservation of power should be a good check for the convergence of the
solution.

by exp[j(2mπx/L)] and integrate it with respect to x over L. We then get the following

Earlier in this section, we discussed Dirichlet’s and Neumann’s problems using the
Rayleigh hypothesis. Similar techniques can be used to solve the two-media problem.

(7.74)
where [Kmn], [Hmn], [Am], and [Dm] are already given. [Ktmn] and [Htmn] have the
same form as [Kmn] and [Hmn], respectively, except that all qn are replaced by –qtn.
The power conservation is checked as follows: for Dirichlet’s and Neumann’s

In this section, we discussed the scattering from a sinusoidal surface using the
Rayleigh hypothesis. This is valid if (2πh/L) < 0.448. If the surface slope is higher
than this or if the surface has a more general shape than a sinusoidal surface, the
Rayleigh hypothesis is, in general, not valid, and a more rigorous method should be
used. One such technique is the T-matrix method, which will be discussed later.
We note here that each mode of the scattered wave, Bn exp(–jqn z – jβn x),
propagates in the direction with the angle θn from the z axis given by
k sin θn = βn = β + 2nπ

= k sin θ𝑖+ 2nπ

224
PERIODIC STRUCTURES AND COUPLED-MODE THEORY
If this angle θn becomes close to ±π/2, the scattered mode propagates along the
surface and a rapid redistribution of the power in all modes takes place within a small
variation of the wavelength or the angle. This effect, known as the Wood anomalies,
has been studied extensively. The condition for the Wood anomalies is, therefore,
λ = L
n(±1 −sin θ𝑖).
(7.78)
This wavelength is sometimes called the Rayleigh wavelength.
7.6
COUPLED-MODE THEORY
Consider two wave guiding structures, such as two waveguides, two optical fibers,
or two strip lines. The wave in each guide propagates with a definite propagation
constant. Suppose that these two guides are close to each other, so that some coupling
of the power takes place. For example, for waveguides, these may be a series of holes
or slits between two guides as in the case of directional couplers. For two strip lines,
the two lines are closely located and the power of the two lines may be coupled. If
the coupling is weak, the coupling perturbs the original guide modes slightly and
transfers the power from one guide to the other. The coupled-mode theory described
in this section provides a mathematical formulation of this coupling process. It is
clear from the above that the coupled-mode theory is applicable only to a weakly
coupled system. For a system with strong coupling, the improved theory should be
used (Hardy and Streifer, 1986; Tsang and Chuang, 1988).
Consider two modes a1 and a2 representing the waves propagating in the two
guides, respectively (Fig. 7.15). If two guides are isolated, each mode is assumed
to propagate with the propagation constant β10 and β20. Therefore, a1 and a2 in the
isolated guides satisfy the following:
da1
dz = −jβ10a1,
da2
dz = −jβ20a2.
(7.79)
FIGURE 7.15
Coupling between two strip lines.

COUPLED-MODE THEORY
225
If these two guides are coupled, the coupling terms between a1 and a2 should be
included in (7.79). We thus write the following coupled equations:
da1
dz = −jβ10a1 −jc12a2,
da2
dz = −jc21a1 −jβ20a2.
(7.80)
The constants c12 and c21 are the mutual coupling coefficients per unit length. Note
that β10 and β20 are real in a lossless system and that if β10 > 0 and β20 > 0, the phase
velocities for the modes a1 and a2 are in the positive z direction, and if β10 < 0, and
β20 < 0, the phase velocities are in the negative z direction.
Let us next consider the power P1 carried by the mode a1. We get
dP1
dz = d
dz
(a1a∗
1
) = a1
da∗
1
dz + da1
dz a∗
1.
(7.81)
Substituting (7.80), we get
dP1
dz = −ja1
(β10 −β∗
10
) a∗
1 + 2 Re (ja1c∗
12a∗

) .
(7.82)
Similarly for P2 = |a2|2, we get
dP2
dz = −ja2
(β20 −β∗
20
) a∗
2 + 2 Re (−ja1 c21 a∗
2
) ,
(7.83)
where Re denotes “real part of.”
If the system is lossless, β10 and β20 are real, and therefore β10 −β∗
10 = 0 and
β20 −β∗
20 = 0. If both powers P1 and P2 are propagated in the same direction, and
thus the group velocities for a1 and a2 are in the same direction, the conservation of
power requires that
d
dz(P1 + P2) = 0.
(7.84)
Using (7.82) and (7.83), this means that for a lossless system,
c12 = c∗
21.
(7.85)
This is called a codirectional coupler. If P1 and P2 are propagated in the opposite
direction, and thus the group velocities are in the opposite directions, we require that
d
dz(P1 −P2) = 0,
(7.86)

226
PERIODIC STRUCTURES AND COUPLED-MODE THEORY
and therefore, for a lossless system,
c12 = −c∗
21.
(7.87)
This is called a contradirectional coupler.
7.6.1
Codirectional Coupler
Consider a lossless system consisting of two guides weakly coupled to each other.
We assume that the phase velocities and the group velocities of waves a1 and a2 are
both in the positive z direction. Thus we have
β10 > 0,
β20 > 0,
c12 = c∗
21.
(7.88)
To solve the coupled equation (7.80), we let
a1(z) = A1 exp(−jβz),
a2(z) = A2 exp(−jβz).
(7.89)
Substituting this into (7.80), we get the following eigenvalue problem:
[
β10
c12
c21
β20
] [
A1
A2
]
= β
[
A1
A2
]
,
(7.90)
where the propagation constant β is the eigenvalue and [A1, A2] is the eigenvector.
The propagation constant β can be obtained by equating the determinant of the
matrix in (7.90) to zero,
||||
β10 −β
c12
c21
β20 −β
||||
= 0.
(7.91)
From this we get two values for β. We arrange these two propagation constants β1
and β2 in the following form:
β1 = βa + βb,
β2 = βa −βb,
(7.92)
where
βa = 1
2(β10 + β20),
βb = (β2
d + c12c21
)1∕2,
βd = 1
2(β10 −β20).

COUPLED-MODE THEORY
227
Since the two powers are propagating in the same direction, this is a codirectional
coupler, and therefore c12c21 = |c12|2 and βa and βb are both real. When βa and βb are
real, the two modes are said to be passively coupled.
The eigenvectors [A1, A2] for β1 and β2 are obtained from (7.90):
A2
A1
= β −β10
c12
=
c21
β −β20
.
(7.93)
The general solutions for a1 and a2 are then given by
a1(z) = C1e−jβ1z + C2e−jβ2z,
a2(z) = C1
β1 −β10
c12
e−jβ1z + C2
β2 −β10
c12
e−jβ2z,
(7.94)
where C1 and C2 are constant.
The constants C1 and C2 are determined by the boundary conditions. Suppose that
the wave is incident in guide 1 at z = 0 and no wave is incident in guide 2 at z = 0.
Thus we have
a1 (0) = a0
and
a2 (0) = 0.
(7.95)
Using this, we get
a1(z) = a0
(
cos βbz −jβd
βb
sin βbz
)
exp(−jβaz),
a2(z) = −ja0
c21
βb
sin βbz exp(−jβaz).
(7.96)
The power in each guide is given by
P1(z) = |a1(z)|2
and P2(z) = |a2(z)|2.
(7.97)
Substituting (7.96) into (7.97), it is easily verified that P1(z) + P2(z) = constant as
expected. The power is then periodically transferred between two guides (Fig. 7.16).

P2 (z)

FIGURE 7.16

PERIODIC STRUCTURES AND COUPLED-MODE THEORY
Note that the maximum transferred power P2(z) is
P2 max =
|C12|2
|βd|2 + |C12|2 |a0|2.
(7.98)
Thus if β10 = β20, the power transfer is 100%.
7.6.2
Contradirectional Coupler
Consider a lossless contradirectional coupler. In this case, the phase velocities for
both modes are in the same direction, but the group velocities are in the opposite
direction. Thus we have
β10 > 0,
β20 > 0,
c12 = −c∗
21.
(7.99)
Following the procedure described in Section 7.6, we get
β1 = βa + βb,
β2 = βa −βb,
(7.100)
where
βa = 1
2(β10 + β20),
βb = [β2
d −|c12|2]1∕2,
βd = 1
2(β10 −β20).
Note that here we used c12c21 = – |c12|2.
The expression for βb indicates that if |βd| < |c12|, then βb is purely imaginary and
the wave will be exponentially growing or decaying. When β1 and β2 are complex,
the two modes are said to be “actively” coupled.
If the power is injected to guide 1 at z = 0, this power is coupled into guide 2 and
propagates in the negative z direction. If no power is injected into guide 2 at z = L,
we have the boundary condition
a1(0) = a0,
a2(L) = 0.
(7.101)
The solution can be obtained following the procedure given for the codirectional
case. The powers P1(z) and P2(z) are sketched in Fig. 7.17. Note that P1(z) – P2(z) is
constant.
In Sections 7.2 and 7.3, we discussed lossless coupled systems where there is no
net power gain. If the guides contain an active medium, the wave may be amplified,

CHAPTER 8
DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC
MEDIA
In Section 2.3, we discussed the constitutive relations ̄D = ε ̄E and ̄B = μ ̄H. They are
valid for a “linear” medium, where ̄D and ̄B are proportional to ̄E and ̄H, respectively.
If ̄D or ̄B is a more general function of ̄E[ ̄D = ̄D( ̄E)], this is the “nonlinear” medium.
For a time-harmonic case, ε and μ are in general functions of frequency ε(ω) and
μ(ω), and this is the dispersive medium. For a nondispersive medium, ε and μ are
independent of frequency. If ε and μ are functions of position, this is called the
inhomogeneous medium; for a homogeneous medium, ε and μ are constant. In an
isotropic medium, ε and μ are scalar and therefore ̄D and ̄B are proportional to ̄E
and ̄H, respectively. In an anisotropic medium, as shown in Section 8.7, ̄D and ̄E,
and ̄B and ̄H are in general not parallel. In a bi-anisotropic medium, ̄D depends on
both ̄E and ̄B, and ̄H depends on both ̄E and ̄B. Chiral medium is an example of a
bi-isotropic medium, and these are discussed in Section 8.22. Two-fluid model of
superconductors at high frequencies is discussed in Sections 8.23 and 8.24.
8.1
DIELECTRIC MATERIAL AND POLARIZABILITY
In Section 2.3, we discussed the constitutive relations for a medium in terms of the
dielectric constant ε, the electric susceptibility χe, or the electric polarization ̄P. They
are related by (Eqs. (2.45) and (2.46))
̄P = (ε −ε0) ̄E = χeε0 ̄E.

DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
Alternatively, the polarization vector ̄P can be viewed as the dipole moments per unit
volume of the medium. In this interpretation, we can write
̄P = N ̄p = Nα ̄E′,
(8.2)
where N is the number of dipoles per unit volume contributing to ̄P, and ̄p is the
moment of each elementary dipole. The dipole moment ̄p is, in turn, produced by the
local electric field ̄E′ and α is called the polarizability. Note that the local field ̄E′ is
not equal to the applied field ̄E.
There are four major mechanisms of producing the dipole moment in a material.
The electronic polarization, expressed by the polarizability αe, is caused by a slight
displacement of electrons surrounding positively charged atomic nuclei under the
influence of the field ̄E′, forming a dipole. The atomic polarization αa is caused
by displacement of differently charged atoms with respect to each other. The dipole
polarization αd, also called the orientation polarization, is caused by the change
of orientation of equivalent dipoles in a medium. Polarizations αe, αa, and αd are
due to the locally bound charges in the atoms or molecules. The fourth polarization,
αs, is called the space charge or interfacial polarization. We discuss the dispersion
properties of these polarizations in the following sections.
In (8.1) and (8.2), we noted that the external applied field ̄E is, in general, different
from the local field ̄E′ that causes the polarization. They are almost identical for
low-pressure gases, but are different for solids, liquids, and high-pressure gases. The
relationship between ̄E′ and ̄E can be obtained by considering a fictitious sphere
surrounding a molecule in the medium (Fig. 8.1). The local field ̄E′ acting on the
molecule at the center of the spherical cavity of radius r0 is the sum of the applied
field ̄E and the field ̄Ep due to the polarization vector ̄P surrounding the cavity.
̄E′ = ̄E + ̄Ep.
(8.3)
The polarization ̄P creates equivalent charges on the wall of the sphere, and the charge
over the elementary area d̄a is given by ̄P ⋅d̄a = P cos θda, da = 2πr sin θrdθ.

This is called the Clausius–Mossotti formula or Lorentz–Lorenz formula.
8.2
DISPERSION OF DIELECTRIC MATERIAL
The dielectric constant of any material is in general dependent on frequency, and
it can be considered constant only within a narrow frequency band. However, if a
broadband pulse is propagated through such a medium, the frequency dependence of
the medium cannot be ignored. The variation of the dielectric constant with frequency
is called dispersion. In this section, we discuss some simple examples of dispersive
media.
Let us consider the dispersion characteristics of dielectric material. We assume a
simplified model of molecules with electrons bound elastically to the heavy nuclei.
The equation of motion for an electron is
md2̄r
dt2 = −mω2
0̄r −mvd̄r
dt + ̄F,
(8.8)
where m is the mass of the electron, ̄r is the displacement of the electron, −mω2
0̄r is the
elastic restoring force, −mνd̄r∕dt is the damping force, ν is the collision frequency,
and ̄F is the Lorentz force acting on the electron. The restoring force is assumed to be
proportional to the displacement of the electron, and the constant ω0 is equal to the

236
DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
frequency of the free oscillations of the electron under the influence of the restoring
force alone. The Lorentz force is given by
̄F = e( ̄E′ + ̄v × ̄B′),
(8.9)
where e is the charge of an electron, ̄E′ and ̄B′ the local Mossotti field (8.5),
and ̄v the velocity of the electron. Since ̄B′ = μ0 ̄H′ and | ̄H′| is of the order of
(ε0∕μ0)1∕2| ̄E′|, |̄B′| is of the order of (1∕c)| ̄E′|, and therefore, assuming that |̄v| ≪c,
the second term of (8.9) is negligible compared with the first term.
Consider a time-harmonic field with exp(jωt). Assume that there are N bound
electrons per unit volume. The polarization vector ̄P is then given by
̄P = Nēr.
(8.10)

fibers. For example, the refractive index of fused silica (SiO2) used for fibers in the
wavelength λ = 0.5–2.0 μm can be given by (8.14) with λ1 = 0.1 μm, B1 = 1.0955
and λ2 = 9 μm, B2 = 0.9 (Marcuse, 1982, p. 485).
8.3
DISPERSION OF CONDUCTOR AND ISOTROPIC PLASMA
In dielectric material, the resonant frequency ω1 in (8.12) is nonzero, and at low
frequency ω →0, εr in (8.12) approaches the static dielectric constant. However, in a
conductor, there are free electrons that are not bound to molecules, and therefore the
restoring force (−mω2
0̄r) in (8.8) is absent. Also, the interaction between the molecules
can be neglected, and the local field ̄E′ is equal to the applied field ̄E. Equation (8.12)
is therefore
εr = 1 +

−ω2 + jωv,
(8.15)
where ωp = (Ne2/mε0)1/2 is called the plasma frequency. N is the number of free
electrons per unit volume and is called the electron density. The damping is caused
by the collisions between the electron and other molecules, and v is called the collision
frequency. If we compare (8.15) with the expression for a conducting medium (note
that ε′ = 1, Table 2.1),
εr = 1 −j σ

DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
At low frequencies ω ≪v, the conductivity σ is, therefore, almost constant. In general,
however, the conductivity σ is a function of frequency.
The dielectric constant of metal in optical wavelengths can be approximately
given by (8.15). For example, at λ = 0.6 μm, silver has the plasma frequency fp = 2 ×
1015 (ultraviolet), the collision frequency fv = 5.7 × 1013 (infrared), and εr = –17.2
– j0.498. If the frequency is increased beyond the plasma frequency, the dielectric
constant becomes almost real and positive and the wave can propagate through metal,
which is called the ultraviolet transparency of metals (Jackson, 1975).
Electromagnetic wave propagation through ionized gas has received consider-
able attention for many years. In particular, the reflection of radio waves and the
transmission from and through the ionosphere have been studied extensively. The
ionosphere was postulated as the Kennelly–Heaviside layer in 1902, and the formula
for its index of refraction, now known as the Appleton–Hartree formula, was obtained
around 1930. Such an ionized gas in which electron and ion densities are substantially
the same is electrically neutral and is called the plasma. The problem of re-entry of
high-speed vehicles such as missiles and rockets has generated considerable interest
in plasma problems. When high-speed vehicles enter the atmosphere, high temper-
ature and pressure in front of the vehicle ionize the air molecules and produce the
so-called plasma sheath. The problems of antenna characteristics, wave propaga-
tion through the plasma, and the radar cross section are of considerable importance.
Also, the antenna and wave propagation characteristics of artificial satellites in the
ionosphere are important in the communication between the vehicle and the earth
station.
If a dc magnetic field is present, the plasma becomes anisotropic and this is
normally called the magnetoplasma. In the absence of dc magnetic fields, the plasma is
isotropic and the equivalent dielectric constant is given by (8.15). Thus, the refraction
index n depends on the operating frequency ω, the plasma frequency ωp, and the
collision frequency v. The electron plasma frequency plays a most important role in
magnetic–ionic theory. Substituting the values of m, e, and ε0, we get
fp =

8.98 × 103 N1∕2

is given by
β = k0n = (k2

(8.19)
Mathematically, this is identical to the propagation constant for a hollow waveguide.

Typical plasma frequency (a) and collision frequency (b) of the ionosphere.
In a waveguide, if the frequency is above the cutoff frequency, the wave propagates,
and if the frequency is below the cutoff frequency, the wave becomes evanescent. In
exactly the same manner, the plasma frequency plays the role of the cutoff frequency.
A well-known example of the cutoff phenomenon is the wave propagation through
the ionosphere. When the operating frequency is higher than the plasma frequency,
radio waves can penetrate through the ionosphere, but at lower frequencies, radio
waves are bounced off the ionosphere, thus contributing long-distance radio-wave
propagation. Typical characteristics of the lower ionosphere are shown in Fig. 8.3.
Some typical values of the electron density are shown in Table 8.1.

DEBYE RELAXATION EQUATION AND DIELECTRIC CONSTANT
OF WATER
The dielectric constant of water at microwave frequencies is governed primarily by
the relaxation phenomenon. Water molecules have permanent dipole moments, and
when microwaves are applied, the polar molecules tend to rotate as if they are in
a damping frictional medium. In (8.12), this frictional force is represented by v.
However, the acceleration term −mω2̄r in (8.11) may be negligibly small compared
with other terms. Thus, the dielectric constant for the medium of polar molecules
may be expressed as
εr = ε∞+ εs −ε∞
1 + jωτ ,
(8.21)
where εs is the static dielectric constant as ω →0, ε∞is the high-frequency limit as ω
→∞, and τ is the relaxation time. They are functions of the temperature. The Debye
formula (Eq. 8.21) is applicable in the frequency range 0.3–300 GHz (Oguchi, 1983;
Ray, 1972).
8.5
INTERFACIAL POLARIZATION
In Section 8.1, we discussed three polarization mechanisms: the electronic, atomic,
and dipole orientation polarizations. They are caused by the displacement of bound or
free electrons or by the change in orientation of the dipole moment of the molecule.
In addition to these three, there is another process, called interfacial polarization or
space-charge polarization. This is due to the large-scale field distortions caused by
the piling up of space charges in the volume or of the surface charges at the interfaces
between different small portions of materials with different characteristics.
The complex dielectric constant εr is written in the form

Note that this model is indistinguishable from (8.21) except for the conductivity term.
Geophysical media often exhibit these characteristics. For a complete discussion on
complex resistivity of earth, see Wait (1989).
8.6
MIXING FORMULA
In Section 8.1, we discussed the Clausius–Mossotti formula, relating the dielectric
constant to the polarizability. The dielectric material was viewed as consisting of many
equivalent dipoles in free space created by the local Mossotti field. The Clausius–
Mossotti formula can be used to obtain the effective dielectric constant of a mixture
of two or more materials with different dielectric constants. The formula that gives
the effective dielectric constant is called the mixing formula.
Let us first consider a simple example of a dielectric material with relative dielectric
constant ε1 in which many spheres of radius a and relative dielectric constant ε2 are
embedded (Fig. 8.4). If the dimension a is comparable to or greater than a wavelength,
substantial scattering can take place. Also, if the fractional volume f, which is the
fraction of the volume occupied by the spheres, is a few percent or higher, a correlation
between the spheres needs to be considered. Here we limit ourselves to the case where
dimensions of the spheres are much smaller than a wavelength, and the spheres are
sparsely distributed. The situation described here is therefore similar to that discussed
in Section 8.1, where the relative dielectric constant εr of the material consisting of
many dipoles is given by
εr = 1 + χe = 1 + 2Nα∕3ε0
1 −Nα∕3ε0
,
(8.23)
where N is the number of dipoles per unit volume and α is the polarizability of the
dipole.

DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
In the case shown in Fig. 8.4, the background dielectric constant is ε1ε0, and thus
we have the effective dielectric constant εe.
εe
ε1
= 1 + 2Nα∕3ε1
1 −Nα∕3ε1
,
(8.24)
where N is the number of spheres per unit volume. The polarizability α of the sphere
is given by (see Section 10.5)
α = 3(ε2 −ε1)
ε2 + 2ε1
ε1V,
(8.25)
where V is the volume of the sphere. The fractional volume f is then given by
f = NV.
(8.26)
Substituting (8.25) and (8.26) into (8.24), we get the effective dielectric constant εe.
εe = ε1
1 + 2fy
1 −fy ,
y = ε2 −ε1
ε2 + 2ε1
.
(8.27)
This is called the Maxwell–Garnett mixing formula. Note that even though we expect
that the formula is valid only for a small fractional volume f ≪1, the effective
dielectric constant εe reduces to ε1 when f = 0 and ε2 when f = 1. Thus, we may
expect that the formula may be a reasonable approximation even when f is not small.
However, if the inhomogeneity is not spherical, the polarizability is different and
although εe reduces to ε1 when f = 0, it does not reduce to ε2 when f = 1. Therefore,
the Maxwell–Garnett formula is in general applicable only when f is small. We
can also rearrange (8.27) in the following form, known as the Rayleigh mixing
formula.
εe −ε1
εe + 2ε1
= f ε2 −ε1
ε2 + 2ε1
.
(8.28)
If the inhomogeneity has a nonspherical shape, the appropriate polarizability for
that shape should be used in place of (8.25).
The Maxwell–Garnett formula (Eq. 8.27) is based on the idea that the inhomogene-
ity with ε2 is embedded in the background ε1. However, more generally, when two
inhomogeneities are mixed, there should be no distinction between the background
and the inhomogeneities. Thus, both the inhomogeneity with ε1 and f1 and the inho-
mogeneity with ε2 and f2(f1 + f2 = 1) are embedded in the artificial background with
the effective dielectric constant εe.
www.ebook3000.com

MIXING FORMULA
243
Here we assume that the inhomogeneities are isotropic and have no preferred
shape or direction. These inhomogeneities, which are the differences between ε1
and εe and between ε2 and εe, create equivalent dipole moments per unit volume
(N1α1 + N2α2) ̄Ee, where ̄Ee is the average field for the background medium with the
effective dielectric constant εe. The effective dielectric constant εe is chosen such that
the average of these dipole moments is zero. Thus, we have
N1α + N2α2 = 0.
(8.29)
Since the inhomogeneities are isotropic, on the average, the polarizability should be
equal to that of a sphere.
α1 = 3(ε1 −εe)

α2 = 3(ε2 −εe)

f1
ε1 −εe
ε1 + 2εe
+ f2
ε2 −εe
ε2 + 2εe
= 0.
(8.31)
This is known as the Polder–van Santen mixing formula and can be rearranged to
give the following form:
f1
ε1 −ε0
ε1 + 2εe
+ f2
ε2 −ε0
ε2 + 2εe
= εe −ε0
3εe
.
(8.32)
Note that the Polder–van Santen form is completely symmetric and ε1, f1 can be
interchanged with ε2, f2, giving the same formula; the Maxwell–Garnett formula is
not symmetrical. The Polder–van Santen formula can be extended to many species
with εn and fn.

(8.33)
Note that the mixing formulas above are for low-frequency cases where the scattering
is negligible. More exact formulas, including scattering and correlations between
particles, must be obtained by considering the propagation constant K of the coherent
wave. Then the effective dielectric constant εe is related to K by K2 = k2εe, where
k is the free space wave number. Extensive studies have been reported on this topic
(Tsang et al., 1985).

DIELECTRIC CONSTANT AND PERMEABILITY FOR
ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
The interactions of electromagnetic fields with materials are characterized by the
constitutive parameters: complex dielectric constant ε and permeability μ. In an
isotropic medium, the property of the material does not depend on the direction of
electric or magnetic field polarizations. Thus ε and μ are scalar quantities.
In anisotropic media, however, the material characteristics depend on the direction
of the electric or magnetic field vectors and thus, in general, the displacement vector
̄D and magnetic flux density vector ̄B are not in the same direction as the electric field
̄E and magnetic field vector ̄H, respectively. The dielectric constant ε must then be
represented by a tensor εij.
D𝑖=

𝑖= 1, 2, 3,
(8.34)
where i, j = 1, 2, and 3 denote the x, y, and z components, respectively. We may write
(8.34) in the following form:
̄D = ̄̄ε ̄E.
(8.35)
Using matrix notation in the rectangular system, (8.34) is expressed by

(8.36)
Similarly, we have the tensor permeability ̄̄μ relating ̄B to ̄H.
̄B = ̄̄μ ̄H.
(8.37)
As will be shown shortly, in general, the reciprocity theorem does not hold for
anisotropic media, and for a plane wave, ̄E and ̄H are not necessarily transverse to
the direction of wave propagation.
8.8
MAGNETOIONIC THEORY FOR ANISOTROPIC PLASMA
A dc magnetic field is often present in plasma. Examples are the earth’s magnetic
field in the ionosphere and a dc magnetic field applied to laboratory plasma. The
presence of the dc magnetic field makes the plasma anisotropic. In this section, we
examine the characteristics of such anisotropic plasma (Yeh and Liu, 1972).
www.ebook3000.com

MAGNETOIONIC THEORY FOR ANISOTROPIC PLASMA
245
The equation of motion for an electron in electromagnetic fields ( ̄E, ̄H) in the
presence of a dc magnetic field ̄Hdc is given by
md̄υ
dt = e ̄E + e[̄υ × ( ̄B + ̄Bdc)] −mv̄υ,
(8.38)
where ̄B = μ0 ̄H and ̄Bdc = μ0 ̄Hdc. As shown in Section 8.2, the term with ̄B is
negligible compared with e ̄E.
For a time-harmonic electromagnetic field with time dependence exp(jωt), neglect-
ing the term with ̄B, we get
jωm̄v = e ̄E + μ0e(̄v × ̄Hdc) −mν̄v.
(8.39)
We rewrite this equation using the plasma frequency ωp
ω2
p = Nee2
m ε0
(8.40)
and the cyclotron frequency ωc
ωc = |e|μ0Hdc
m
.
(8.41)
Note that ωc is the frequency of a circular motion of an electron in a plane perpen-
dicular to the dc magnetic field. This is obtained by equating the centrifugal force
(mu2)/r to the force evμ0Hdc due to the magnetic field and noting that ωc = 2π/T and
T = 2πr/v.
The dc magnetic field ̄Hdc is pointed in the direction (θ, ϕ) and its rectangular
components are (Fig. 8.5)
̄Hdc = Hdc[sin θd cos ϕd ̂x + sin θd sin ϕd̂y + cos θd̂z]
= Hdcx̂x + Hdcŷy + Hdcẑz.
(8.42)
We also note that the polarization vector ̄P is given by
̄P = N0ēr.
(8.43)
We now rewrite (8.39) in the following form:
−̄PU = ε0X ̄E + j ̄P × ̄Y,
(8.44)
where Z = j(ν/ω), X = ω2
p∕ω2, U = 1 – j(ν/ω), and ̄Y = e μ0 ̄Hdc∕mω. Note that since
e is negative for electrons, ̄Y is pointed in the opposite direction to ̄Hdc.

where [1] is a 3 × 3 unit matrix.
Note that if the dc magnetic field is reversed, all Yx, Yy, and Yz change the sign,
and as seen in (8.46), this is equivalent to transposing the matrix [χe] and [εr].
[χe] →[̃χe],
[εr] →[̃εr].
(8.48)
Note also that the anisotropy is produced by the cyclotron frequency ωc. The cyclotron
frequency fc = ωc/2π of the earth’s magnetic field is approximately fc = 1.42 MHz.
8.9
PLANE-WAVE PROPAGATION IN ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
Let us consider the characteristics of a plane wave propagating in an anisotropic
medium. We let ̄k = k̂ι, where k is the propagation constant and ̂ι is the unit vector in
the direction of wave propagation. In general, the propagation constant k depends on
the direction ̂ι.
We seek a plane-wave solution that has the following general form:
ej(ωt−̄k⋅̄r).
(8.49)
First, we note that in general, ̄E and ̄H are not necessarily perpendicular to ̄k, but ̄D
and ̄B are always perpendicular to ̄k. To prove this, we note that for a plane wave
∂
∂x(e−j̄k⋅̄r) = −jkx(e−j̄k⋅̄r),
̄k = kx̂x + kŷy + kẑz,

248
DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
and therefore
∇= ̂x ∂
∂x + ̂y ∂
∂y + ̂z ∂
∂z
= −jkx̂x −jkŷy −jkẑz = −j̄k.
(8.50)
Thus the divergence equations
∇⋅̄B = 0
and
∇⋅̄D = 0
become
−j̄k ⋅̄B = 0
and
−j̄k ⋅̄D = 0,
(8.51)
which proves that ̄B and ̄D are perpendicular to ̄k. This, however, does not show that
̄E and ̄H should be perpendicular to ̄k since ̄E and ̄D (or ̄H and ̄B) are not parallel in
anisotropic media.
8.10
PLANE-WAVE PROPAGATION IN MAGNETOPLASMA
Let us write Maxwell’s equations for a plane wave using (8.50)
−j̄k × ̄E = −jω ̄B,
−j̄k × ̄H = jω ̄D.
(8.52)
In magnetoplasma, we have
̄B = μ0 ̄H
and
̄D = ε0̄̄εr ̄E,
(8.53)
and thus substituting (8.53) into (8.52), we obtain the equation for ̄E
̄k × ̄k × ̄E + ω2μ0ε0̄̄εr ̄E = 0
(8.54)
and ̄H is given by
̄H =
̄k × ̄E
ωμ0
.
(8.55)
It is now possible to obtain the propagation constant k from (8.54). Let us first
write (8.54) in matrix form. Noting that
̄k × ̄k × ̄E = ̄k(̄k ⋅̄E) −(̄k ⋅̄k) ̄E,
̄k = kx̂x + kŷy + kẑz,
(8.56)

we write (8.54) in the following matrix form:

(8.57)

0 = ω2μ0ε0, [1] is a 3 × 3 unit matrix, [εr] is a 3 × 3 matrix given by (8.47),
and [E] is a column matrix given in (8.45).
Equation (8.57) is the fundamental matrix equation for an anisotropic medium
with the tensor dielectric constant [εr]. Since this is a homogeneous linear equation
for [E], the nonzero solution for [E] is obtained when the following determinant is
zero.
|||K ̃K −k2[1] + k2
0[εr]||| = 0.
(8.58)
The solution of this equation gives the propagation constant k.
It will be shown in Sections 8.11–8.13 that for the wave propagating along the
dc magnetic field, there are two circularly polarized waves with different propaga-
tion constants, and for the wave propagating in the direction perpendicular to the dc
magnetic field, there are two linearly polarized waves with different propagation con-
stants. In general, there are two elliptically polarized waves for the wave propagating
in an arbitrary direction.

The equivalent dielectric constant ε+ and ε– are plotted in Fig. 8.6. It is obvious that
the behavior of ε+ is similar to that for the isotropic case, and for this reason, the wave

wave.

extraordinary wave propagates. The VLF waves cannot penetrate the ionosphere in
the absence of the dc magnetic field because the frequency is below the plasma
frequency. However, in the presence of the earth’s magnetic field, the extraordinary
VLF wave can propagate in the direction of the dc magnetic field. This is the main
mechanism of the whistler mode.
The whistler is a form of radio noise in the audio-frequency range (1–20 kHz)
characterized by a whistling tone. The VLF components of the short electromagnetic
pulse due to a lightning stroke can penetrate the ionosphere by means of the extraor-
dinary mode and propagate along the earth’s geomagnetic field as shown in Fig. 8.8.
The signal may then be reflected and returned back propagating along the magnetic
field. The whistling effect results from different group velocities and the time delay
for different frequency components (Fig. 8.8). The time T required for the signal at a
certain frequency with the group velocity νg is

FARADAY ROTATION
As discussed in Section 8.11, when a wave is propagating through an anisotropic
medium in the direction of the dc magnetic field, two circularly polarized waves can
propagate with different propagation constants. As a result, if these two circularly
polarized waves are properly combined so as to produce a linearly polarized wave at
one point, then as the wave propagates, the plane of polarization rotates and the angle
of rotation is proportional to the distance. This is called the Faraday rotation.
To show this, let us assume that at z = 0, two circularly polarized waves are
combined to give
Ex = Ex0,
Ey = 0.
(8.74)

254
DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
At any other point, in general
Ex = Ex+ e−jk+ z + Ex−e−jk−z,
(8.75)
where Ex+ and Ex– are the magnitudes of two circularly polarized waves given in
Section 8.11. Each Ex+ and Ex– must be accompanied by its Ey+ and Ey– as given by
(8.65) and (8.70). Thus,
Ey = jEx+ e−jk+ z −jEx−e−jk−z.
(8.76)
At z = 0, Ex = Ex + + Ex– = E0 and Ey = j(Ex + – Ex–) = 0, as given by (8.74), and
thus,
Ex+ + Ex−= E0
2 .
Therefore, we have
Ex = E0
2 (e jk+ z + e jk−z),
Ey = jE0
2 (e−jk+ z −e−jk−z).
(8.77)
By writing
k± = k+ + k−

we express Ex and Ey by

stant

(8.79)
and whose plane of polarization rotates with the angle
θf = k+ −k−
2
z.
(8.80)
The angle θf is proportional to the distance z.

PROPAGATION PERPENDICULAR TO THE DC MAGNETIC FIELD
255
If the wave is propagating in the negative z direction, the formulas above are valid
with the change k+ →–k+, k– →–k–, and z →–z. Thus if the wave is propagated in the
positive z direction, and then at the end of the path reflected back and propagated in the
negative direction, the Faraday rotation is doubled. This is an important characteristic
of magnetic rotation. In contrast with this, natural rotation is canceled as the wave is
propagated forward and then reflected back. The natural rotation is the rotation of the
plane of polarization in liquids such as sugar solutions, which have an asymmetrically
bound carbon atom. It also occurs in crystals such as quartz and sodium chlorate,
which have helical structure. They are characterized by two types of structures, which
are related to each other like right-handed and left-handed screws. These two screws
are otherwise identical, but they cannot be brought into coincidence by any rotation
in three-dimensional space (see Sommerfeld, 1954, pp. 106 and 164). This natural
rotation is also called optical activity and takes place in bi-anisotropic medium such
as chiral medium. See Section 8.22.

This wave is the ordinary wave because εz is the same as the case of isotropic plasma,
and the dc magnetic field has no effect on this plane-wave propagation. This is
expected because both electric and displacement vectors are in the z direction, and
electrons move along the dc magnetic field and their motions are not affected by the
presence of the dc magnetic field.

But in addition to these fields, Ex, the component in the direction of the propagation,
appears. This is produced by the coupling between Ex and Ey in the anisotropic
medium.

THE HEIGHT OF THE IONOSPHERE
Consider a radio-wave pulse that is sent vertically toward the ionosphere. The electron
density of the ionosphere depends on the height, and its typical profile is shown in
Fig. 8.3. The electron density distribution with height may be explained by observing
that the rate of production of electrons depends on the sun’s radiation and the air
density, but the sun’s radiation increases with height while the air density decreases
with height, and therefore, there is a maximum electron density at a certain height.
Let us assume that the effects of the earth’s magnetic field and the collision fre-
quencies are negligible. The radio wave with a certain frequency f = ω/2π propagates
up to the height z0, where the plasma frequency fp = ωp/2π becomes equal to f
(Fig. 8.9). This height z0 is called the true height. However, the time τ required for a
radio pulse to travel from the ground to z0 and back is, assuming that νg is a slowly

DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
In an anisotropic medium, the propagation constant k = (ω/c)n depends on the direc-
tion of the wave propagation and therefore, (8.88) should hold for each component
of the group velocity ̄vg.

of constant ω. This is the surface representing the dispersion relation for a fixed
frequency (Fig. 8.10).
k(θ, ϕ) = ω
c n(θ, ϕ).

The surface k = constant is called the wave vector surface. Often it is useful to
introduce the refractive index surface, where the refractive index n is constant.
Obviously, these two surfaces are proportional to each other and carry the same
information.

WARM PLASMA
In the magnetoionic theory discussed in Sections 8.8, it is assumed that the motions
of electrons are caused by the Lorentz force. However, since the temperature of
the electron gas is finite, the motions of electrons are also affected by the pressure
variations of the electron gas. The magnetoionic theory ignores the effects of the finite
temperature and the pressure variations, as they are normally small, and therefore
it is equivalent to dealing with the electron gas at negligible temperature. Thus the
magnetoionic theory may be considered as the theory dealing with cold plasma.
However, recent studies on the impedance of antennas in the ionosphere indicate
that there is a need to include the effects of the finite temperature and warm plasma.
The pressure variation of warm plasma may be considered as an acoustic wave, and
therefore inclusion of the finite temperature means the study of the interaction of the
electromagnetic wave and the acoustic wave in the electron gas.
Let us start with the following basic equations for warm plasma.

(8.96)
where
̄v = velocity of electron,
e, m = charge and mass of electron,
N = electron density, number of electrons per unit volume,
P = pressure,
kb = Boltzmann’s constant,
T = temperature, Kelvin.
Note that the current density ̄J is expressed in (8.93) as Nēv. The second term on the
right side of (8.94) is the force due to the pressure gradient, and (8.95) represents the
change of the number of electrons per unit volume.
We assume that there is no dc magnetic field Hdc = 0. We also write N and P as
the sum of the average N0 and P0 and the ac (acoustic) components n and p.
N = N0 + n,
P = P0 + p.
(8.97)
Now we assume that the ac components are small compared with the average values,
and therefore all nonlinear terms containing the product of two ac components are
negligible.
Under the foregoing assumptions, (8.93) through (8.95) become

place, is more appropriate. In this case, P and N satisfy the following:

where γ is the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure and constant volume. From
this, we get
p = γnkbT.
(8.104)
Equations (8.98)–(8.101) and (8.104) constitute the fundamental equations for
isotropic warm plasma. The value of γ for plasma is approximately equal to 3.
(Note that γ = 5

5 for diatomic gas such as air, and
γ = 4
3 for polyatomic gas (Yeh and Liu, 1972, p. 94)).
8.17
WAVE EQUATIONS FOR WARM PLASMA
In order to obtain the wave equation for acoustic waves, we take the divergence of
(8.100) and use (8.101) and (8.104) to eliminate ̄v and n. We get
∇2p −1

∂t2 p −N0e∇⋅̄E = 0,
(8.105)
where u = (γkbT/m)1/2 is the sound velocity of the electron gas if there were no charge
e = 0 and is called Laplace’s sound velocity for the adiabatic case. (In contrast, for the
isothermal case, it is called Newton’s sound velocity and is equal to (kbT/m)1/2.) The
last term of (8.105) is proportional to ∇⋅̄v through(8.99), whichis inturnproportional
to p through (8.101) and (8.104). Taking the divergence of (8.99), we get

The phase velocity is therefore

(8.109)
Note that the acoustic velocity u is modified by the plasma frequency ωp.
The wave equation for the electromagnetic field is obtained by taking the curl of

Let us consider a time-harmonic case and assume that a plane wave is propagating in
a direction given by the propagation vector ̄k. Thus all electric and magnetic vectors
have exp(−j̄k ⋅̄r) dependence, and therefore the operator ∇can be replaced by −j̄k.
Noting that
̄∇× ̄∇× ̄E = −̄k × ̄k × ̄E = −[̄k(̄k ⋅̄E) −̄Ek2],
with ̄k ⋅̄k = k2, we get

(8.115)
which is identical to that of a cold plasma.
Since ̄H = (1∕ωμ0)̄k × ̄E, no magnetic field is associated with ̄E||, but ̄H⊥associ-
ated with ̄E⊥is given in the same manner as that of a cold plasma. These two waves
̄E|| and ̄E⊥can exist in an infinite space independently, with two different propagation
constants. However, these two components are coupled together at a boundary or at
an exciting source. For example, a plane wave incident on a warm plasma excites both
components, and the amount of excitation for each component depends on boundary
conditions. Also, a dipole source in a warm plasma excites an acoustic wave, and
thus, the impedance of the antenna is affected by the acoustic wave.
8.18
FERRITE AND THE DERIVATION OF ITS PERMEABILITY TENSOR
In 1845, Faraday discovered the rotation of the plane of polarization of light when
propagating through various materials under the influence of the dc magnetic field,
now called the Faraday rotation. Until about 1946, this effect could not be utilized
at microwave frequencies due to the high loss in ferromagnetic materials. But the
discovery of low-loss ferrite materials made it possible to employ this material for a
variety of microwave applications. Polder developed the general tensor permeability
for the ferrite in 1949, and Tellegen in 1948 and Hogan in 1952 developed a microwave
network element called the gyrator utilizing ferrite. Commercial ferrite devices have
been available since about 1953.
Let us first derive the tensor permeability for the ferrite based on a simplified model
of a spinning electron. A spinning electron can be considered as a gyromagnetic top.
Let the angular momentum be ̄J. Then the magnetic moment ̄m is parallel to ̄J and in
the opposite direction. The magnitude of m is proportional to J. Thus
̄m = γ̄J.
(8.116)
The proportionality constant γ is negative and is found to be
γ = −e
me
= −1.7592 × 1011 C∕kg
= gyromagnetic ratio.
The equation of angular motion for a single electron is then
d̄J
dt = torque.
(8.117)

264
DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
The torque on the magnetic moment m is given by
̄m × ̄B.
Thus we get
d ̄m
dt = γ ̄m × ̄B.
(8.118)
We first note that when this magnetic top is placed in the dc magnetic field, the
top precesses around the direction of the magnetic field with the angular velocity
ω0 = −γB = −γμ0H,
(8.119)
which is known as the Larmor precessional frequency. This precessional motion is
described by
dJ
dt = J × ω0.
(8.120)
Eventually, however, this precession dies down due to the damping, and all the
magnetic tops become aligned with the dc magnetic field. Then the ferrite is said to
be saturated. Let H0 be the applied external dc magnetic field. Then the field in the
ferrite is given by
H𝑖= H0 −Hdem,
(8.121)
where Hdem is the demagnetizing field. In general, Hi is not in the same direction as
H0 and depends on the shape of the material. However, if the ferrite is an ellipsoid,
Hi is parallel to H0. It must be kept in mind that the internal field Hi is not the same
as the applied field and may not even be in parallel direction.
Let us take a unit volume and consider the magnetic polarization
̄M = Ne ̄m,
(8.122)
where Ne is the number of effective electrons per unit volume. In terms of M, we
write (8.118) as
d ̄M
dt = γ ̄M × ̄B.
(8.123)
Next we express each of B, H, and M as a sum of the dc component and small ac
component. Thus we write
B = μ0(H + M),
H = H𝑖+ Ha,
M = M𝑖+ Ma,
(8.124)
where Hi and Mi are the dc components and Ha and Ma are the small ac components.

Noting that M × M = 0, we get
d ̄M
dt = μ0γ( ̄M × ̄H).
(8.125)
We then obtain
dM𝑖
dt + dMa
dt
= μ0γ(M𝑖× H𝑖+ M𝑖× Ha + Ma × H𝑖+ Ma × Ha).
(8.126)
Note that Mi is constant and Mi and Hi are in parallel, and thus dMi/dt = 0 and Mi ×
Hi = 0.
We assume that the ac component is small compared with the dc component, and
thus the last term is negligibly small compared with the other terms. We then obtain
the following linearized equation:
dMa
dt
= μ0γ(M𝑖× Ha + Ma × H𝑖).
(8.127)
We choose the z axis along the direction of the internal magnetic field Hi and Mi.
We also consider the time-harmonic case, with exp(jωt) dependence. Then we can
represent (8.127) in the following matrix form:

̄E = −1

̄k × ̄H.
(8.133)
This can also be obtained by noting the duality principle, in which E, H, ̄̄ε, and ̄̄μ are
replaced by H, −̄E, ̄̄ε, and ̄̄μ. Since this is the same form as the magnetoplasma case,
only the results are shown here.

Faraday Rotation and Circulators
The Faraday rotation can be used to construct nonreciprocal microwave networks.
For example, the device pictured here (Fig. 8.11a) contains a ferrite that produces 90◦
rotation of the polarization. If a wave is incident from the left, the phase is reversed

on the other side. But if a wave is incident from the right, there is no phase shift
(Fig. 8.11b). Thus this device is represented by a schematic diagram in Fig. 8.11c,
showing a phase shift of 180◦for a wave propagating to the right and no phase shift
for a wave propagating to the left.
It is possible to make use of this device and combine it with two magic tees to
construct a circulator (see Fig. 8.12). A wave entering terminal a divides equally,
but because of the π phase shift, these two waves do not appear in d, but they are
combined into b. Similarly, the wave entering b appears only in c. The wave entering
c appears only in d, and the wave entering d appears only in a.
8.20.2
One-Way Line
It is also possible to construct a one-way line using the Faraday rotation. One scheme
may be as follows. A wave entering from the left goes through this device with little
attenuation, but the wave entering from the right is absorbed in the resistive sheet,
which is placed in parallel with the electric field. This device is placed at the output
of an oscillator to isolate the oscillator from the variations in the load and is called

the isolator (Fig. 8.13). The other uses of ferrite-loaded waveguides include phase
shifters and modulators.
8.20.3
Thermodynamic Paradox of One-Way Line
In the example of a one-way line above, the wave can propagate to the right, but
the wave propagating to the left is absorbed by the resistive sheet. If there were
no resistive sheet, it could be shown that this is not a one-way line. In fact, there
should be no lossless one-way line, because if a one-way line is lossless, the energy
on one side can transfer to the other side, causing a temperature rise without exter-
nal work. This violates the second law of thermodynamics. However, in the study
of microwave propagation through a ferrite-loaded waveguide, it was found that
Maxwell’s equations can be solved for lossless waveguide with lossless ferrite, and
a one-way propagation constant can be obtained within some ranges of frequency
and parameters. This prompted the question of whether lossless Maxwell’s equations
violate the law of thermodynamics.
The answer to this so-called “thermodynamic paradox” can be found in the concept
that mathematical formulations of any physical problem must satisfy three conditions:
(1) uniqueness, (2) existence, and (3) the solution must depend continuously on the
variation of physical parameters. Problems that satisfy these three conditions are
called properly posed. For the microwave problem above, it can be shown that if we
solve Maxwell’s equations for lossy ferrite and then take the limit as the resistivity
goes to zero, the absorbed power is correctly accounted for and there is no conflict

with the law of thermodynamics. Only if we start with lossless Maxwell’s equations
can the second law of thermodynamics be violated, but the problem in this case is
improperly posed and therefore does not represent a physical problem.
8.21
LORENTZ RECIPROCITY THEOREM FOR ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
Electromagnetic fields in anisotropic media do not in general obey the reciprocity
relationship. It is, however, possible to find the condition under which the reciprocal
relationship holds for anisotropic media. This section deals with this question.
Let us consider the time-harmonic case (ejωt). Consider the fields E1 and H1 in
the medium ̄̄ε1 and ̄̄μ1, and E2 and H2 in the medium ̄̄ε2 and ̄̄μ2. We write two sets of
Maxwell’s equations
∇× E1 = −jωB1 −Jm1,
∇× H1 = jωD1 + J1,
www.ebook3000.com

LORENTZ RECIPROCITY THEOREM FOR ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
271
and
∇× E2 = −jωB2 −Jm2,
∇× H2 = jωD2 + J2.
(8.142)
Now consider the identity
∇⋅(E1 × H2) = H2 ⋅∇× E1 −E2 ⋅∇× H2
and substituting from Maxwell’s equations, we get
∇⋅(E1 × H2) = −jω[H2 ⋅B1 + E1 ⋅D2] −H2 ⋅Jm1 −E1 ⋅J2.
(8.143)
Similarly,
∇⋅(E2 × H1) = −jω[H1 ⋅B2 + E2 ⋅D1] −H1 ⋅Jm2 −E2 ⋅J1.
In isotropic media, we subtract the second equation from the first and setting ε1 =
ε2 and μ1 = μ2, we obtain the Lorentz reciprocity theorem.
∇⋅(E1 × H2) −∇⋅(E2 × H1) = H1 ⋅Jm2 −H2 ⋅Jm1 + E2 ⋅J1 −E1 ⋅J2.
(8.144)
Note that equation (8.144) made use of the fact that for isotropic media, the first term
on the right side of the two equations in (8.143) is the same, and therefore that term
cancels out when taking the difference between the two.
H2 ⋅B1 −H1 ⋅B2 = (μ2 −μ2)H1 ⋅H2 = 0.
However, in anisotropic media, these terms do not cancel each other. Expressing
in matrix form, we get
̃H2 ̃̄̄μ H1 = ̃H1 ̃̄̄μ2 H2 = ̃H1(̃̄̄μ1 −̄̄μ2)H2.
(8.145)
This is not zero when ̄̄μ1 = ̄̄μ2. For this term to be zero, ̄̄μ2 must be a transpose of ̄̄μ1.
̃̄̄μ1 = ̄̄μ2
and also
̃̄̄ε1 = ̄̄ε2.
(8.146)
This occurs when the dc magnetic field is reversed, or ̄̄ε and ̄̄μ are symmetric tensors.
Then we have the same reciprocity theorem.

272
DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
Under condition (8.146), let us consider a case when Jm1 = Jm2 = 0. We integrate
over a volume V, and obtain
∫S
(E1 × H2 −E2 × H1) ⋅dS = ∫V
(E2 . J1 −E1 ⋅J2) dV.
(8.147)
Now we let the surface S expand to infinity. At a large distance, R, E, and H behave
as a plane wave and E and H are perpendicular to R and to each other. Thus
E1 = Ae−jkR
R
,
H1 =
√ε0
μ0
𝑖R × E1,
E2 = Be−jkR
R
,
H2 =
√ε0
μ0
𝑖R × E2.
Then
E2 × H2 ⋅dS = E1 × H2 ⋅𝑖RdS =
√ε0
μ0
H1 ⋅H2 dS
and
E2 × H1 ⋅dS =
√ε0
μ0
H1 ⋅H2 dS.
Therefore, the integral over S then becomes zero. We then obtain
∫V
E2 ⋅J1 dV = ∫V
E1 ⋅J2 dV,
(8.148)
where V is taken as an entire space.
Let us consider the physical significance of (8.148). We let J1 = J1(r1) and
J2 = J2(r2). Then the equation states that the field E1 at r2 due to the source J1 at
r1 is equal to the field E2 at r1 due to the source J2 at r2, provided that ̄̄ε and ̄̄μ are
transposed. Thus we can say that in isotropic media, the reciprocity theorem holds,
but in anisotropic media, the reciprocity holds for the following cases: (1) when ̄̄ε and
̄̄μ are symmetric as in the case of crystal, or (2) when the dc magnetic field is reversed
for the case of ferrite and magnetoplasma. When ferrite material is used in antennas,
the transmitting pattern is not equal to the receiving pattern unless the dc magnetic
field is reversed. This is an important consideration when making measurement of
antenna radiation pattern.
8.22
BI-ANISOTROPIC MEDIA AND CHIRAL MEDIA
At the end of Section 8.12, we mentioned the difference between Faraday rotation
and natural rotation. If a wave is propagated in plasma or ferrite along the dc magnetic

field, and then reflected back and propagated in the reverse direction, the rotation of
the plane of polarization is doubled, while the rotation is canceled for natural rotation.
This natural rotation of the plane of polarization is called “optical activity,” and is
caused by the right-handed or left-handed property of the medium such as right-
handed helix or left-handed helix. The optical activity has been known for many
years and its mathematical formulations have been investigated by many workers
(see Sommerfeld, 1954; Kong, 1972, 1974; Bassiri et al., 1988; Lakhtakia et al.,
1988).
In a preceding section, we have discussed anisotropic media characterized by the
constitutive relations
̄D = ̄̄ε ̄E
and
̄B = ̄̄μ ̄H.
(8.149)
We can generalize these relations to the bi-anisotropic media
[ ̄D
̄H
]
=
[ ̄P
̄L
̄M
̄Q
] [ ̄E
̄B
]
,
(8.150)
where, in general, ̄P, ̄L, ̄M, and ̄Q are 3 × 3 matrices. Note that in (8.150), ̄D and ̄H are
given in terms of ̄E and ̄B. As indicated at the end of Section 2.1, the force depends
on ̄E and ̄B, and therefore ̄E and ̄B are the fundamental field quantities and ̄D and ̄H
are the derived fields through the constitutive relations.
If the medium is lossless, then Re(∇⋅̄S) must be zero, where ̄S = 1
2 ̄E × ̄H∗is the
complex Poynting vector (Section 2.3). Noting that
∇⋅̄S = −jω
2 [ ̄H∗⋅̄B −̄E ⋅̄D∗],
(8.151)
Re(∇⋅̄S) = 0 is equivalent to
̄H∗⋅̄B −̄H ⋅̄B∗−̄E ⋅̄D∗+ ̄E∗⋅̄D = 0.
(8.152)
Substituting (8.150) into this, we get
̄P = ̄P+,
̄Q = ̄Q+,
̄M = −̄L+,
(8.153)
where ̄P+ means the complex conjugate of the transpose of ̄P. The detailed exposition
on this topic is given by Kong (1972).

274
DISPERSION AND ANISOTROPIC MEDIA
If ̄P, ̄L, ̄M, and ̄Q are scalar, this is called the bi-isotropic medium, which is also
called chiral medium. Noting the symmetry relations (8.153), we write the constitutive
relations for a lossless chiral medium as
̄D = ε ̄E −jγ ̄B,
̄H = −jγ ̄E + 1
μ
̄B,
(8.154)
where ε, μ, and γ are real scalar constants. Note that γ has the dimension of admittance,
(ε/μ)1/2. It is also possible to rewrite (8.154) in the form
̄D = (ε + γ2μ) ̄E −jγμ ̄H,
̄B = jγμ ̄E + μ ̄H.
(8.155)
Furthermore, using ∇× ̄H = +jω ̄D and ∇× ̄E = −jω ̄B, we can rewrite (8.155) in the
following form:
̄D = ε1[ ̄E + β∇× ̄E],
̄B = μ1[ ̄H + β∇× ̄H].
(8.156)
This form shows that for bi-isotropic medium, ̄D depends not only on ̄E at a point,
but also on the behavior of ̄E in the neighborhood of that point represented by ∇× ̄E.
This nonlocal behavior of ̄D is called the spatial dispersion.
Let us combine Maxwell’s equations with the constitutive relations (8.155).
∇× ̄E = −jω ̄B = −jω(μ ̄H + jγμ ̄E),
∇× ̄H = jω ̄D = jω[(ε + γ2μ) ̄E −jγμ ̄H].
(8.157)
We first substitute ̄H from the first equation into the second equation and express
∇× ̄H in terms of ∇× ̄E and ̄E. Then we take the curl of the first equation and
substitute ∇× ̄H. We then get the equation for ̄E.
−∇× ∇× ̄E + 2ωγμ∇× ̄E + ω2με ̄E = 0
(8.158)
and we get the identical equation for ̄H.
Let us find the propagation constant K for a plane wave propagating in the z
direction. Since ̄E behaves as exp(–jKz), we get ∇= −jK̂z and therefore (8.158)
becomes
[

be zero.

(8.160)
This can be solved to obtain two propagation constants,
K1 = ωμγ + [(ωμγ)2 + k2]1∕2
K2 = −ωμγ + [(ωμγ)2 + k2]1∕2.
(8.161)
Substituting K1 into one of the equations (8.159), we get
(−K2
1 + k2)Ex + jK12ωγμEy = 0,
from which we get
Ex = jEy.
(8.162)
This is a RHC. The corresponding magnetic field is obtained from (8.157).
̄H =
j
ωμ −∇× ̄E −jγ ̄E.
(8.163)
Using ∇= −jK̂z and (8.162), we get
Ex

Hx
=
ωμ
[(ωμγ)2 + k2]1∕2 .
(8.164)
Similarly, for K2, we get a LHC.
Ex = −jEy.
(8.165)
The ratio of E to H is the same as given in (8.164). It is clear from (8.161) that if
γ > 0, K1 > k > K2 and thus the phase velocity for RHC is slower than for LHC. If γ
< 0, K1 < k < K2 and thus the LHC wave has a slower phase velocity than the RHC
wave. From (8.157), we note that taking the divergence, ∇⋅̄B = 0 and ∇⋅̄D = 0.
Also, from (8.158), we get ∇⋅̄H = 0 and ∇⋅̄H = 0. Therefore, using ∇= −j ̄K for a
plane wave, we conclude that the plane wave in chiral medium is a TEM wave.
All the analysis shown above can be derived from (8.156) with the following
correspondence:
μ =

ε = ε1,
γ = ωε1β,

SUPERCONDUCTORS, LONDON EQUATION, AND THE
MEISSNER EFFECTS
Superconductors are used in transmission lines, waveguides, and resonant cavities
because they have low losses, their dispersion is small, and they can be used for
broadband transmission. In this and the next section, we discuss the derivation of
London equations; the Meissner effect; and the complex conductivity, penetration
depth, and surface impedance of superconductors at high frequencies. We will not
discuss the physics of superconductors or the historical development, such as the
discovery of superconductivity by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, Meissner’s work,
Fritz and Heinz London’s work, BCS theory (Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer),
Ginzburg–Landau theory, and the work on high-temperature superconductors. They
are clearly outside the scope of this book. For the topics discussed in this section,
readers are referred to very informative books by Mendelssohn (1966), Van Duzer
and Turner (1981), Ghoshal and Smith (1988), and Lee and Itoh (1989).
In normal conductors, free electrons are assumed to move under the influence of the
electric field and experience collisions as described in Section 8.3. In superconductors,
pairs of electrons are involved and their behavior is quite different from that of single
electrons. The electron pairs are immune from collisions.
Consider the electron-pair fluid. We write the equation of motion
m∗∂̄vs
∂t = e∗̄E,
(8.169)
where m* = 2m and e* = –2e are the pair effective mass and pair effective charge,
and m and e are electron mass and charge. The pair-current density Js is given by
̄Js = n∗
s e∗̄vs,
(8.170)
where n∗
s is the number density of pair. Combining these two, we get the first London
equation
Λ∂̄Js
∂t = ̄E,
Λ =
m∗
n∗
s e∗2 .
(8.171)

SUPERCONDUCTORS, LONDON EQUATION, AND THE MEISSNER EFFECTS
277
Next we use one of the Maxwell equations,
∇× ̄E = −∂̄Bs
∂t .
(8.172)
Substituting the first London equation, we get
Λ∇× ̄Js + ̄Bs = 0.
(8.173)
This is the second London equation. It is interesting to note that in ordinary electro-
magnetic theory, the steady current produces the magnetic field through ∇× ̄H = ̄Js,
but steady magnetic field does not produce the current in a conductor. However, in
the superconductor, steady magnetic field causes current as shown in (8.173).
Let us consider the dc case. We then have
∇× ̄H = ̄Js.
(8.174)
Taking the curl of this equation and substituting (8.173) and noting that μ ≅μ0 and
∇⋅̄B = 0, we get
∇2 ̄B = ̄B
λ2 ,
(8.175)
where λ2 = Λ∕μ0 = m∗∕n∗
s e∗2 μ0. If z = 0 is the surface of superconductor and
̄B = B(z)̂x, we get, from (8.175),
B(z) = B0 exp
(
−z
λ
)
.
(8.176)
This shows that the static magnetic field penetrates the superconductor only a small
distance given by λ. This λ is called the penetration distance and is of the order of
0.05–0.1 μm. The phenomenon that the superconductor tends to exclude the static
magnetic flux is called the Meissner effect.
When a small magnet is dropped onto a superconductive plate, the magnetic
flux cannot penetrate the surface and induces current on the surface. This, in effect,
creates the image of magnet with the same polarity, which lies below the surface, and
therefore the magnet is repelled by the image, cannot approach the superconductor,
and is suspended in air.
The penetration distance λ depends on the pair density n∗
s as shown in (8.175).
The number of paired electron ns = 2n∗

TWO-FLUID MODEL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS
AT HIGH FREQUENCIES
Let us next consider the high-frequency behavior of the superconductor. In general,
only a fraction of the conducting electrons is in superconductive state; the remainder
is in the normal state. For the electron pairs in superconductive state, we have, from
(8.169),
md̄vs
dt = −e ̄E,
(8.179)
where m* = 2m and e* = –2e are used. For a normal state, we have
md̄vn
dt + m ̄vn
τ = −e ̄E,
(8.180)
where τ is the momentum relaxation time and is normally much shorter than 10−11
s. The total current density ̄J is given by the sum of the superconductive current ̄Js
and the normal current ̄Jn.
̄J = ̄Js + ̄Jn,
̄Js = −nsēvs,
̄Jn = −nnēvn,
n = ns + nn.

For a time-harmonic field with exp(jωt), we get from (8.179) and (8.180),

Let us next consider the penetration for electromagnetic wave into the supercon-

Microstrip lines using a high-temperature superconductor give low loss and vir-
tually no dispersion (Lee and Itoh, 1989; Ghoshal and Smith, 1988). Typical values
used are Tc = 92.5 K, T = 77 K (liquid nitrogen), λ(0) = 0.14 μm and σn = 0.5 S/μm.
Thus σ1 = 0.24 S/μm and σ2 = 336 S/μm at 10 GHz. The strip line has an attenuation
of 10−3 dB/cm, compared with an aluminum line with 1 dB/cm attenuation. The
phase velocity for the superconducting line is almost constant over a wide frequency
range (Lee and Itoh, 1989).

CHAPTER 9
ANTENNAS, APERTURES,
AND ARRAYS
In this chapter, we review the fundamental definitions and formulations related to
antennas, aperture antennas, linear antennas, and arrays. For a more complete treat-
ment of these topics, see Elliott (1981), Jull (1981), Mittra (1973), Wait (1986), Bal-
anis (1982), Ma (1974), Hansen (1966), Stutzman and Thiele (1981), Stark (1974),
Mailloux (1982), and Lo and Lee (1988).
9.1
ANTENNA FUNDAMENTALS
An antenna is usually designed to produce a desired radiation pattern in various
directions. The most useful measures of antenna characteristics are directivity and
gain. If the power radiated per unit solid angle in the direction (θ, ϕ) is P(θ, ϕ) and
the total power radiated is Pt, the directivity D is given by
D = 4πP(θ, ϕ)
Pt
.
(9.1)
Note that Pt/4π is the average power per unit solid angle if the antenna is an isotropic
radiator, and therefore, the directivity represents the ability of the antenna to produce
more power in a certain direction and less power in other directions than the isotropic

solid angle is 4π
∫4π
D(θ, ϕ) dΩ = 4π.
(9.2)
The gain function G(θ, ϕ) is defined by
G(θ, ϕ) = 4πP(θ, ϕ)
P𝑖
,
(9.3)
where Pi is the power input to the antenna.
If the antenna is lossless, Pi = Pt and therefore G = D. The transmitting pattern is
the normalized directivity defined by D(θ, ϕ)/Dm, where Dm is the maximum value
of D.
A receiving antenna absorbs power from incident waves. If the power flux density
of the incident wave coming from the direction (θ, ϕ) is S(θ, ϕ) and the received
power is Pr, the receiving cross section Ar(θ, ϕ) is defined by
Pr = SAr.
(9.4)
The receiving pattern is given by Ar(θ, ϕ)/Arm, where Arm is the maximum value of
the receiving cross section.
Next, we show that the transmitting and receiving patterns of an antenna are the
same.
D(θ, ϕ)
Dm
= Ar(θ, ϕ)

(9.5)
Also, we show that the receiving cross section Ar(θ, ϕ) and the gain G(θ, ϕ) of any
matched antennas are related by
Ar(θ, ϕ) = λ2
4πG(θ, ϕ).
(9.6)
To show these relationships, consider two matched lossless antennas 1 and 2
(Fig. 9.1). If the power P1 is supplied to antenna 1, the received power Pr2 at antenna
2 is given by
Pr2 = P1G1Ar2
4πR2
.
(9.7)
Similarly, if the power P2 is applied to antenna 2, the received power at antenna 1 is
Pr1 = P2G2Ar1

average receiving cross section of a convenient simple antenna. If we take a short

RADIATION FIELDS OF GIVEN ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC
CURRENT DISTRIBUTIONS
The exact current distributions on an antenna such as a wire antenna must be deter-
mined by solving the complete boundary value problem. This is discussed in Sec-
tion 9.8. However, in many practical antennas, the approximate current distributions
are known based on more exact calculations or on experimental data. In this section,
we present the radiation field due to given current distributions.
Let us consider the given distribution of the electric current ̄J and the magnetic
current ̄Jm in space (Fig. 9.3). The electric field outside the source region is given by
the Hertz vector formulations in Sections 5.2 and 5.3.

In the far field, Green’s function is approximated by (6.119)
G0(̄r, ̄r′) = e−jkR+jk̂o⋅̄r′

and the operator ∇is equal to ∇= −jk̂o. Therefore, in the far zone, we get

Eϕ = ̂ϕ ⋅̄E.

Noting the identities
̂O × ̂O × ̄J = ̂O( ̂O ⋅̄J) −̄J,
̂θ ⋅( ̂O × ̄Jm) = ̄Jm ⋅(̂θ × ̂O) = −̂ϕ ⋅̄Jm,
̂ϕ ⋅( ̂O × ̄Jm) = ̄Jm ⋅( ̂ϕ × ̂O) = −̂θ ⋅̄Jm,

Therefore,

(9.28)
This is the fundamental formula for the far-field components Eθ and Eϕ, due to the
given current distributions ̄J and ̄Jm. Note that the θ and ϕ components of ̄J contribute
to Eθ and Eϕ and the ϕ and θ components of ̄Jm contribute to Eθ and Eϕ. The actual
calculations can be done in different coordinate systems. For example, in a Cartesian
system, we have
θ = ̂x cos θ cos ϕ + ̂y cos θ sin ϕ −̂z sin θ,
ϕ = −̂x sin ϕ + ̂y cos ϕ,
̂o = ̂x sin θ cos ϕ + ̂y sin θ sin ϕ + ̂z cos θ,
̄r′ = ̂xx′ + ̂yy′ + ̂zz′.
(9.29)
Therefore,
̂θ ⋅̄J = cos θ cos ϕ Jx + cos θ sin ϕ Jy −sin θ Jz.
̂ϕ ⋅̄J = −sin ϕ Jx + cos ϕ Jy,
̂o ⋅̄r′ = x′ sin θ cos ϕ + y′ sin θ sin ϕ + z′ cos θ.

In a cylindrical system, we have
̄J(r′, ϕ′, z′) = ̂r′Jr′ + ϕ′Jϕ + ̂z′Jz′,

Therefore, we get

RADIATION FIELDS OF DIPOLES, SLOTS, AND LOOPS
In this section, we give some examples of the radiation fields of known current
distributions based on the formulation (9.26). It is known (Elliott, 1981, Chapter 2)
that the current distribution on a wire antenna is approximately sinusoidal. For the
wire antenna shown in Fig. 9.4, the current distribution is given by
I(z′) = I0
sin[k(1 −|z′|)]

For a half-wave dipole, the integral in (9.37) can be evaluated either numerically or
analytically using sine and cosine integrals, and we get
Rr = 73.09 ohms.
(9.39)
Note that the resistive component of the input impedance Zi = Rr + jX is given
by the radiated power and is independent of the wire diameter, but the reactive
component X depends on the stored energy in the near field. Therefore, X depends on
the wire diameter and must be obtained by solving the boundary value problem. The

by

F(θ, ϕ) =
N
∑
n=1
In ejkd(n−1) sin θ sin ϕ.
(9.53)
If all the antennas are located on a line as shown in Fig. 9.7, they are called linear
arrays. If the antennas are located on a circle or on the surface of a sphere, they are
called circular arrays or spherical arrays.
If all the currents in a linear array are identical, we get

Fig. 9.8. Note the main lobe, grating lobes, and the visible region (−π/2 < θ < π/2).
Extensive studies have been made on antenna array problems (Elliott, 1981; Ma,
1974). In this section, we present some interesting ideas about linear arrays. Consider
the array factor (9.53) in the y–z plane (ϕ = π/2). If we let

This is a polynomial of the degree N −1, and therefore we write
F = A(Z −Z1)(Z −Z2) ⋯(Z −ZN−1),
(9.57)
where Zn is the zeros of the polynomial and A is constant. Note that the array factor
||F|| is given by the magnitude of F evaluated on a unit circle in the complex Z plane,
and that the desired array factor can be obtained by placing the zeros Zn appropriately
in the complex Z plane (Fig. 9.9). This method was first proposed by Shelkunoff in
1943.
Next let us consider a method to synthesize a desired radiation pattern. Sup-
pose that we place 2N + 1 antennas as shown in Fig. 9.10. The array factor is

(9.58)
This is a Fourier series representation of F(θ) = F(γ), and therefore for a desired
radiation pattern F(γ), we expand F(γ) in Fourier series and the Fourier coeffi-
cient can be identified as the current in each antenna element. For a more detailed
discussion on antenna pattern synthesis, see Collin and Zucker (1969) and Ma
(1974).
In the above, we considered only equally spaced arrays. They are mathemati-
cally the most convenient and are normally used in practical applications. There
are some applications, however, where unequally spaced arrays are more desir-
able. For example, the resolution capability of an antenna depends on the total
size: Δθ = λ/size. However, if the spacing d is greater than a wavelength and
is uniform, there will be grating lobes in the visible region (Fig. 9.8). We can,
however, eliminate these grating lobes even when the spacing is much greater
than a wavelength if we use unequally spaced arrays. Therefore, unequally spaced
arrays can be used to obtain a better resolution with a smaller number of antenna
elements.
Let us consider the array factor for an unequally spaced array (Fig. 9.11)

This is identical to the radiation from an equivalent continuous source distribution

(9.64)
This means that this equivalent source distribution is equal to the actual current distri-
bution I(y) modified by the density function dv/dy. The equivalent source distribution
Sm(y) for Fm is given by
Sm(y) = S0(y)e−j2mπv(y).
(9.65)
This has the additional phase shift across the aperture. If the spacings are uniform,
v(y) = Ny/L and this creates the grating lobe at k sin θ = 2 mπN/L. However, if
the spacing is nonuniform, the grating lobe at this angle disappears and the power
contained in this lobe is spread out in the angle.
We will not go into a detailed discussion on several important array problems,
such as Dolph–Chebyshev arrays, circular arrays, spherical arrays, conformal arrays,
three-dimensional arrays, randomly spaced arrays, and phased arrays, as they are
discussed extensively in the literature (Hansen, 1966; Lo and Lee, 1988).

and ̂n is the unit vector normal to the surface S pointed toward the observation point.
Following the procedure in Section 9.2, we get the far field from the known field
distribution on a surface S:

(9.67)
This gives the exact field (Eθ, Eϕ) if the exact surface fields ̂n × ̄Hs and ̄Es × ̂n are
known. In practice, the exact surface fields ̄Es and ̄Hs are rarely known and we need
to use approximate surface fields.
For example, if the aperture is large, as in the case of parabolic reflector antennas,
the field ̄Es, ̄Hs on the conducting reflector surface S1 can be well approximated by
the field that would exist if the reflector surface were locally plane (Fig. 9.13). Thus
we have
̄Es × ̂n = 0,
̂n × ̄Hs = 2̂n × ̄H𝑖
on S1,
(9.68)
where ̄H𝑖is the field from the feed horn in the absence of the reflector. The use of
the approximation (9.68) is called the Kirchhoff approximation and is identical to the
physical optics approximation.
Instead of using the field (9.68) on the surface S1 of the reflector, we can also
use the field on the plane aperture S2 in front of the reflector. We can use (9.67) and
approximate ̄Es and ̄Hs by the field on S2 from the feed reflected from the reflector,
or we can use the equivalence theorem (Section 6.10) and note that the field on the

right of S2 is given by the field 2 ̄E × ̂n due to the magnetic current ̄Jm = ̄E × ̂n and its

Eϕ = −jk

(9.69)
In principle, (9.67) and (9.69) should give the same correct far field if the appropriate
surface fields ̄Es and ̄Hs are exactly known and if the surface completely surrounds
the object. In practice, however, this is not possible. The fields on S1 or S2 are only
approximately known, and therefore, there are slight differences between (9.67) and
(9.69) in the far-sidelobe region. In the main lobe region, both are almost identical
and give excellent results.
As an example, consider the radiation from a rectangular aperture (Fig. 9.14) with
the field distribution.
̄Es = ̂xEsx(x′, y′) in the aperture
−a∕2 ≤x′ ≤a∕2
−b∕2 ≤y′ ≤b∕2.

Note that the radiation pattern is proportional to the Fourier transform F(kx, ky) of
the aperture field Esx(x′, y′) evaluated at kx = k sin θ cos ϕ and ky = k sin θ sin ϕ.
This Fourier transform relationship between the aperture field distribution and the
radiation pattern is an important and useful result. If the aperture distribution is

(9.73)
we have the same formula (9.71) except that F should be expressed in the cylindrical

F(θ, ϕ) = ∫∫Esx(ρ′, ϕ′)ejkρ′ sin θ cos(ϕ,ϕ′)ρ′dρ′dϕ′.

RADIATION FROM MICROSTRIP ANTENNAS
Microstrip antennas are made of a thin patch of metal on a grounded dielectric slab
as shown in Fig. 9.16. The metal patch is approximately a half-wavelength long and
is fed by a coaxial line or a strip line. Thus, it can be viewed as a half-wavelength
transmission-line cavity with open terminations at both ends where the power leaks
out. It is a narrow-band antenna, but it has a low profile and is lightweight. Its
radiation pattern is close to that of a half-wave dipole radiating normal to the surface,

and thus an array of microstrip antennas can easily be formed for high-gain scanning
operations.
Let us first consider a rectangular patch antenna (Fig. 9.16). This can be considered
as a rectangular cavity of dimensions a × b × t with the boundary condition at the
edge that the tangential magnetic field is zero (magnetic wall) (see Section 4.14).
Therefore, we write the electric field inside the cavity as
Ez(x, y) = E0 cos mπx

(9.80)
The antenna is operated at a frequency close to this resonant frequency. For a >
b, the lowest resonant frequency occurs when m = 1 and n = 0. (The static field
m = n = 0 is excluded.)
The radiation field can be calculated using several equivalent techniques (Lo et al.,
1979; Bahl and Bhartia, 1980, p. 8; Elliott, 1981, p. 105). Here we use the equivalent

magnetic current at the edge of the patch and its image due to the ground plane. We
then get the following magnetic currents at the edge of the patch:

(9.81)
We substitute these into (9.69) and note the following:
̂ϕ ⋅( ̄Es × ̂n) = −sin ϕEx + cos ϕ Ey,
̂θ ⋅( ̄Es × ̂n) = −cos θ cos ϕEx + cos θ sin ϕ Ey,
̂o ⋅̄r′ = x′ sin θ cos ϕ + y′ sin θ sin ϕ.
(9.82)
We then get
Eθ = −jk
2πRe−jkRV0(−sin ϕg1 −cos ϕg2),
Eϕ = + jk
2πRe−jkRV0(cos θ cos ϕg1 −cos θ sin ϕg2),

Here, we assumed that the thickness t of the patch is much smaller than a wavelength,
and thus it is assumed that the magnetic current is a narrow line current at the edge
of the patch located just above the ground plane.
Microstrip antennas are operated at the lowest resonant frequency with m = 1 and
n = 0, and therefore, k = 2πfr∕c = π∕a√εr. To account for the fringe field, Lo (1979)

used the following effective sizes and obtained good agreement between theory and

(9.84)
Circular patch antennas of radius a can be analyzed similarly by using the following
field inside the cavity (Section 4.14):
Ez = E0J1(k11ρ) cos ϕ,

where
k11 = 1.841

The magnetic current is then
̄Es × ̂n = ̂zEz × ̂ρ = Ez ̂ϕ.

This is then substituted into (9.69). Care should be taken to differentiate the angle ϕ
at the observation point (R, θ, ϕ) and the angle ϕ′ for the field at the edge of the patch
(a, ϕ′) (see Eqs. 9.31 and 9.32). The far field is then given by

Wire antenna excited by a voltage V0.
In general, there are two ways of determining the input impedance. One way is that
the exact current distribution I(z) for a given voltage can be determined by solving
the boundary value problem, then using this current at z = 0 to obtain the input
impedance. This, however, requires extensive theoretical and numerical work. In
many cases, we are often not interested in the exact current distribution, but we wish
to have a simple method of calculating useful and approximate input impedances.
This second approach is shown in this section. It is based on a variational expression
for the impedance such that an approximate current distribution is used to obtain
the impedance with greater accuracy than the current distribution (Elliott, 1981,
Chapter 7).
Let us assume that the wire size a is much smaller than a wavelength and that
the current density Jz on the surface of the wire is all directed in the z direction, and
therefore, the z component of the electric field Ez is obtained from the following:
̄E = ∇× ∇× ̄π = ∇(∇⋅̄π) + k2̄π.
(9.89)
Taking the z component and noting that ̄π = πẑz, we get
Ez =

where S′ is the area enclosing the wire. Since Jz(̄r′) has no azimuthal variation, we
let ds′ = adϕ′dz′, integrate with respect to ϕ′, and let I(z′) be the total current at z′.
We also let the current I(z′) be located on the axis of the wire and evaluate Ez on the
surface of the wire. Then, we get
Ez(z) = ∫
l

K(z, z′)I(z′)dz′,

,
r = [a2 + (z −z′)2]1∕2.
Now, the electric field Ez is zero on the surface of the wire except on the gap where
it is equal to −E0. Thus we write
Ez(z) =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
−E0,
|z| < δ

(9.92)
If we multiply both sides by I(z) and integrate over (−l, l), we get
∫
l
−l
Ez(z)I(z)dz = −V0I(0).
(9.93)
From this, we get the input impedance Z
Z = V0
I(0) = −∫
l

Ez(z)I(z)dz

(9.94)
where Ez(z) is the z component of the electric field produced by the current I(z′) and

Z = −

I(z)K(z, z′)I(z′)dz′dz.
(9.95)
Equation (9.94) or (9.95) is a variational expression for Z, and therefore, if the current
is I + δI and the corresponding impedance is Z + δZ, (9.95) gives δZ = 0 indicating
that for the first-order approximation for I, the impedance has second-order error.
Thus the accuracy of the calculated impedance is better than the accuracy of the
current distribution used in the equation (see Appendix 7.B).

SELF- AND MUTUAL IMPEDANCES OF WIRE ANTENNAS
311
We can now use (9.95) and an approximate current distribution I(z) to obtain
the impedance. The current distribution is known to be sinusoidal if a/λ << 1, and
therefore, we use
I(z) = Im sin k(l −|z|).
(9.96)
Then, we get (Elliott, 1981, p. 300)
Z =

Cin(x) is the modified cosine integral,
Cin(x) = ∫

It should be noted that the resistive component of the input impedance is related to the
radiated power, and therefore it is insensitive to the wire size a. However, the reactive
component is related to the reactive power, which represents the stored energy in the
near field, and therefore it depends very much on the wire size.
Let us next consider the mutual impedance between antennas 1 and 2 (Fig. 9.18).
The voltages V1 and V2 and the currents at the terminals I1(0) and I2(0) are related
by a linear relationship applicable to any linear passive network.
V1 = Z11I1(0) + Z12I2(0),
V2 = Z21I1(0) + Z22I2(0),
(9.98)
where Z12 = Z21. Z11 and Z22 are the self-impedances and Z12 is the mutual impedance.
Now, consider the z component of the electric field E2 on the surface of the wire 2.
This consists of the contribution from the currents I1(z) and I2(z), and therefore we
write
E2(z) = E21(z) + E22(z),

where E21(z) is the field on the surface of wire 2 produced by I1 and E22(z) is the

the wire surface except at the gap |z| < δ/2, where the voltage V2 is applied. Thus we

K21 is given by the same expression as (9.91) except that a is replaced by the spacing

as it should.
If the current I1(z′) is assumed to be sinusoidal,
I1(z′) = Im1 sin k(l1 −|z′|),
(9.105)
then the integral in (9.104) can be performed (Elliott, 1981, p. 331), giving the

This can then be substituted into (9.102) to obtain the mutual impedance.
The input impedance of microstrip antennas can be obtained by using the same
formula, (9.94). The field Ez(z) is then the field produced by the current I(z) on the feed
in the presence of the microstrip antenna. Here the feedpin size must be considered
to obtain the accurate value of the reactive component of the input impedance.

CHAPTER 10
SCATTERING OF WAVES BY
CONDUCTING AND DIELECTRIC
OBJECTS
In radar, the radio wave is transmitted toward an object and the scattered wave
received by an antenna reveals the characteristics of the object, such as its posi-
tion and motion. In biomedical applications, microwaves, optical waves, or acoustic
waves are propagated through biological media and the scattering from various por-
tions of a body is used to identify the objects for diagnostic purposes. The scattering
of waves may be used to probe atmospheric conditions, such as the size, density,
and motion of rain, fog, smog, and cloud particles, which in turn gives useful infor-
mation on the environment and for weather prediction. In microwave and space
communication systems, there is an increasing need for higher frequencies and mil-
limeter waves because of their larger channel capacity. However, millimeter waves
suffer absorption and scattering by the atmosphere much more than do microwaves,
and thus the knowledge of these scattering characteristics is essential to reliable
communications.
In this chapter, we develop basic formulations of the scattering problem and discuss
whenever possible potential applications. We limit ourselves to the scattering by a
single object (Kerker, 1969; van de Hulst, 1957). Also in this chapter, we exclude
the rigorous boundary value solutions of spherical, cylindrical, and other complex
objects as they are covered in Chapters 11–13. Some material in Chapter 10 is taken
from Chapter 2 of my book Wave Propagation and Scattering in Random Media
(reissued by IEEE Press and Oxford University, 1997).

SCATTERING OF WAVES BY CONDUCTING AND DIELECTRIC OBJECTS
10.1
CROSS SECTIONS AND SCATTERING AMPLITUDE
When an object is illuminated by a wave, a part of the incident power is scattered out
and another part is absorbed by the object. The characteristics of these two phenom-
ena, scattering and absorption, can be expressed most conveniently by assuming an
incident plane wave. Let us consider a linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave
propagating in a medium having dielectric constant ε0 and permeability μ0 with the
electric field given by
̄E𝑖(̄r) = ̂e𝑖exp(−jk̂𝑖⋅̄r).
(10.1)
The amplitude |Ei| is chosen to be 1 (volt/m), k = ω√μ0ε0 = (2π)∕λ is the wave
number, λ is a wavelength in the medium, ̂𝑖is a unit vector in the direction of wave
propagation, and ̂e𝑖is a unit vector in the direction of its polarization.
The object may be a dielectric particle such as a raindrop or ice particle, or a
conducting body such as an aircraft (Fig. 10.1). The total field ̄E at a distance R
from a reference point in the object, in the direction of a unit vector ̂o, consists of
the incident field ̄E𝑖and the field ̄Es scattered by the particle. Within a distance R <
D2/λ (where D is a typical dimension of the object such as its diameter), the field ̄Es
has complicated amplitude and phase variations because of the interference between
contributions from different parts of the object, and the observation point ̄r is said
to be in the near field of the object. When R > D2/λ, however, the scattered field ̄Es
behaves as a spherical wave and is given by
̄Es(̄r) = ̄f(̂o, ̂𝑖)e−jkR
R
for R > D2
λ .
(10.2)
Here, ̄f(̂o, ̂𝑖) represents the amplitude, phase, and polarization of the scattered wave
in the far field in the direction ̂o when the object is illuminated by a plane wave prop-
agating in the direction ̂𝑖with unit amplitude and is called the scattering amplitude. It
should be noted that even though the incident wave is linearly polarized, the scattered
wave is in general elliptically polarized.

Consider the scattered power flux density Ss at a distance R from the object in the
direction ̂o, caused by an incident power flux density Si. We define the differential
scattering cross section as follows:
σd(̂o, ̂𝑖) = lim
R→∞
R2Ss
S𝑖
= | f(̂o, ̂𝑖)|2 = σt
4πp(̂o, ̂𝑖),
(10.3)

density vectors.

(10.4)
and η0 = (μ0/ε0)1/2 is the characteristic impedance of the medium. We see that σd
has the dimensions of area/solid angle. It may be defined physically as follows:
suppose that the observed scattered power flux density in the direction ̂o is extended
uniformly over 1 steradian of solid angle about ̂o. Then the cross section of an
object that would cause just this amount of scattering would be σd, so that σd varies
with ̂o. The dimensionless quantity p(̂o, ̂𝑖) in (10.3) is called the phase function and
is commonly used in radiative transfer theory. The name “phase function” has its
origins in astronomy, where it refers to lunar phases and has no relation to the phase
of the wave. σt is the total cross section, to be defined in (10.9).
In radar applications, the bistatic radar cross section σbi and the backscattering
cross section σb are commonly used. They are related to σd through
σb𝑖(̂o, ̂𝑖) = 4πσd(̂o, ̂𝑖),
σb = 4πσd(−̂𝑖, ̂𝑖).
(10.5)
σb is also called the radar cross section. A physical concept of σbi may be obtained
in a way similar to that used in obtaining σd above. Suppose that the observed power
flux density in the direction ̂o is extended uniformly in all directions from the object
over the entire 4π steradians of solid angle. Then the cross section that would cause
this would be 4π times σd for the direction ̂o.
Next, let us consider the total observed scattered power at all angles surrounding
the object. The cross section of an object that would produce this amount of scattering
is called the scattering cross section σs, and is given by
σs = ∫4π
σd dω = ∫4π
||̄f(̂o, ̂𝑖)||
2 dω = σt
4π ∫4π

where S0 is an arbitrary surface enclosing the object and d̄a is a vector representing
the differential surface area directed outward (Fig. 10.2).
Next, consider the total power absorbed by the object. The cross section of an
object that would correspond to this much power is called σa, the absorption cross
section. It can be expressed either in terms of the total power flux entering the object
or as the volume integral of the loss inside the particle.

where ̄E = ̄E𝑖+ ̄Es and ̄H = ̄H𝑖+ ̄Hs are the total fields. Finally, the sum of the
scattering and the absorption cross sections is called the total cross section σt or the
extinction cross section.
σt = σs + σa.

plane wave. The scattering amplitude should then be expressed by a 2 × 2 scattering
amplitude matrix. This is explained in more detail in Section 10.10.
10.2
RADAR EQUATIONS
Let us consider a transmitter Tr illuminating an object at a large distance R1. Let G(̂𝚤)
be the gain function of the transmitter and Pt be the total power transmitted. The
scattered wave is received with a receiver Re at a large distance R2. We let Ar(̂o) be
the receiving cross section of the receiver and Pr be the received power. We now wish
to find the ratio Pr/Pt (Fig. 10.3). We assume that R1 and R2 are large and that the
object is in the far field of both antennas. This requires that approximately
R1 >

and
R2 >

where Dt and Dr are the aperture sizes of the transmitter and the receiver.
The gain function G(̂𝚤) of an antenna is the ratio of the actual power flux P(̂𝚤)
radiated per unit solid angle in the direction ̂𝚤to the power flux Pt/4π of an isotropic
radiator per unit solid angle. We therefore have
G(̂𝚤) =

where σbi is the bistatic cross section given in (10.5). The received power Pr, when
a wave is incident on the receiver from a given direction (̂o), is given by
Pr = Ar(̂o)Sr,
(10.15)
where Ar(̂o) is called the receiving cross section.
It is known that for all matched antennas, the receiving cross section is proportional
to the gain function and their ratio is λ2/4π (see Section 9.1).
Ar(̂o) = λ2
4πGr(−̂o),
(10.16)
where Gr(−̂o) is the gain function in the direction −̂o.
Combining (10.13) to (10.16), we get the ratio of the received power to the

both as a transmitter and a receiver. Thus, ̂o = −̂𝑖and R1 = R2 = R. Therefore, for
radar, we have

(10.18)
Equations (10.17) and (10.18) give the received power in terms of the antenna gains,
the distances, and the cross section. This is applicable when the object is far from
both the transmitter and the receiver. It is also required that the receiving antenna be
matched to the incoming wave in polarization and impedance. If there is a mismatch,
(10.17) and (10.18) must be multiplied by a mismatch factor that is less than unity.
In addition, both the transmitter and the receiver must be in the far zone of the object
(R1 > 2Do/λ2 and R2 > 2Do/λ2; Do is the object size).
10.3
GENERAL PROPERTIES OF CROSS SECTIONS
Before we discuss the mathematical representations of the various cross sections, it
may be worthwhile to present an overall view of how these cross sections are related
to the geometric cross section, wavelength, and dielectric constant. If the size of an
object is much greater than a wavelength, the total cross section σt approaches twice
the geometric cross section σg of the object as the size increases. To show this, let
us consider an incident wave with power flux density Si (Fig. 10.4). The total flux
Siσg within the geometric cross section σg is either reflected out or absorbed by the
object. Behind the object, there should be a shadow region where practically no wave
exists. In this shadow region, the scattered wave from the object is exactly equal to

magnitude. The total scattered and absorbed flux, therefore, approaches (Siσg + Siσg)
and the total cross section σt approaches
σt →
2S𝑖σg
S𝑖
= 2σg.
(10.19)
It is also seen that the total absorbed power, when the object is very large, cannot
be greater than Siσg, and thus the absorption cross section σa approaches a constant
somewhat less than the geometric cross section.
σa →σg.
(10.20)
If the size is much smaller than a wavelength, the scattering cross section σs is
inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength and proportional to
the square of the volume of the object. These characteristics of a small object are
generally called Rayleigh scattering. The absorption cross section σa for a small
scatterer is inversely proportional to the wavelength and directly proportional to its
volume. Compared with the geometric cross section, we have

Curves of the normalized cross section above versus relative size of an object are
sketched in Fig. 10.5.
It is also possible to obtain the behavior of the backscattering cross section σb for
a large object. Consider a point of specular reflection on the surface of the object
(Fig. 10.6). An incident wave with power flux density Si is incident on a small area
Δl1Δl2 = (a1Δθ1)(a2Δθ2). Since the radii of curvature are large, the surface may be
considered locally plane, and therefore, using the reflection coefficient for normal

At a large distance R from the particle, the flux within this small area Δl1Δl2 spreads
out over an area R2(2δθ1)(2δθ2), and therefore, the scattered flux density Ss at R is
related to Sr through
Ss R2(2δθ1)(2δθ2) = Sr(a1 δθ2)(a2 δθ2),

This is the limiting value of σb as the object size is increased to infinity, and therefore,
for any finite size, σb may have a value considerably different from (10.23).
The total cross section σt represents the total power loss from the incident wave
due to the scattering and absorption of a wave by the object. This loss is closely
related to the behavior of the scattered wave in the forward direction, and this general
relationship is embodied in the forward scattering theorem, also called the optical
theorem.
The forward scattering theorem states that the total cross section σt is related to
the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction ̄f(̂𝑖, ̂𝑖) in the
following manner:
σt = −4π
k Im[ ̄f(̂𝑖, ̂𝑖)] ⋅̂e𝑖,
(10.24)
where Im denotes the “imaginary part of” and ̂e𝑖is the unit vector in the direction of
polarization of the incident wave. The proof is given in Appendix 10.A.
10.4
INTEGRAL REPRESENTATIONS OF SCATTERING AMPLITUDE
AND ABSORPTION CROSS SECTIONS
Mathematical descriptions of scattering amplitude and absorption cross sections can
be made in one of the two ways. If the shape of an object is a simple one such as a
sphere, it is possible to obtain exact expressions for cross sections and the scattering
amplitude. The exact solution for a dielectric sphere, called the Mie solution, is
discussed in Chapter 12. In many practical situations, however, the shape of an
object is not simple. Therefore, we need a method of determining approximate cross
sections for objects with complex shapes. This can be done through general integral
representations of the scattering amplitude. The method is also useful for objects with
simple shapes because the calculations can be made easily.
Let us consider a dielectric body whose relative dielectric constant is a function
of the position within the body.

The dielectric body occupies the volume V and is surrounded by a medium whose
dielectric constant is ε0.
We first write Maxwell’s equations
∇× ̄E = −j ωμ0 ̄H,
∇× ̄H = −j ωε(̄r) ̄E.
(10.26)
Here, we assume that the permeability μ0 is constant in and outside the dielectric
body. If we write the second equation in (10.26) in the following manner:
∇× ̄H = j ωε0 ̄E + ̄Jeq,

the term ̄Jeq may be considered as an equivalent current source which generates the

̄H(r) = ̄H𝑖(̄r) + ̄Hs(̄r),
(10.28)
where ( ̄E𝑖, ̄H𝑖) is the primary (or incident) wave that exists in the absence of the
object, and ( ̄Es, ̄Hs) is the scattered wave originating from it. Using the Hertz vector
̄Πs, we write
̄Es(̄r) = ∇× ∇× ̄Πs(̄r),

is the free-space Green’s function. Equation (10.29) is valid only for ̄r ≠̄r′.
To obtain the scattering amplitude, we consider ̄Es(̄r) in the far field of the object.
Referring to Fig. 10.7, we note that ̄r = R̂o, and in the far zone, the magnitude
1∕||̄r −̄r′|| of Green’s function can be approximated by 1/R. However, the phase
k ||̄r −̄r′|| cannot be approximated by kR because the difference may be significant in

term, we get
||̄r −̄r′|| = (R2 + r′2 −2R̄r′ ⋅̂o)1∕2 ≃R −̄r′ ⋅̂o,
and Green’s function becomes for large R,
G0(̄r, ̄r′) = exp(−jkR + jk̄r′ ⋅̂o)

and thus ∇is equivalent to −jk̂o. Substituting (10.30) and (10.31) into (10.29), we

[ ̄E −̂o(̂o ⋅̄E)][εr(̄r′) −1] exp( jk̄r′ ⋅̂o) dV′,
(10.32)
where we used −̂o × (̂o × ̄E) = ̄E −̂o(̂o ⋅̄E). Note also that ̂o(̂o ⋅̄E) is the component
of ̄E along ̂o, and therefore, [ ̄E −̂o(̂o ⋅̄E)] is the component of ̄E perpendicular to
̂o. This is an exact expression for the scattering amplitude ̄f(̂o, ̂𝑖) in terms of the
total electric field ̄E(̄r′) inside the object. This field ̄E(̄r′) is not known in general, and
therefore, (10.32) is not a complete description of the scattering amplitude in terms of
known quantities. In many practical situations, however, it is possible to approximate
̄E(̄r′) by some known function and thus obtain a useful approximate expression for
̄f(̂o, ̂𝑖). This will be done in Sections 10.5–10.7. The absorption cross section σa for
a dielectric body has been given in (10.8).
We note here that we can develop an alternative integral equation for the magnetic
field ̄H(̄r) rather than ̄E(̄r). From Maxwell’s equations, we obtain the vector wave
equation for ̄H in the following form:
∇× ∇× ̄H(̄r) −ω2 μ0 ε0 ̄H(̄r) = ω2 μ0 ε0[εr(̄r) −1] ̄H(̄r) + j ωε0[∇εr(̄r) × ̄E(̄r)].
(10.33)
Therefore, an integral equation for ̄H has two terms
̄H(̄r) = ̄H𝑖(̄r) + ̄Hs(̄r) = ̄H𝑖(̄r) + ∇× ∇× ̄Πms(̄r),

where ∇′ εr(̄r′) is the gradient with respect to ̄r′. Thus, the second term in ̄Πms contains
the effect of depolarization due to the inhomogeneity of the dielectric constant. For
a homogeneous object, ∇′ εr(̄r) gives a delta function on the surface, and thus the
second term becomes a surface integral.

RAYLEIGH SCATTERING FOR A SPHERICAL OBJECT
We have indicated in Section 10.3 the general scattering characteristics of a small
object. This is generally known as Rayleigh scattering. In this section, we present
a detailed analysis for a few simple geometries. Let us consider a dielectric sphere
whose size is much smaller than a wavelength. Because of its small size, the impinging
electric field within and near the sphere must behave almost as an electrostatic field.
It is known in electrostatics that when a constant electric field Ei is applied to a
dielectric sphere, the electric field ̄E inside the sphere is uniform and is given by
(Fig. 10.8)
̄E =
3
εr + 2
̄E𝑖,
̄E𝑖= E𝑖̂e𝑖.
(10.35)
We also note in (10.32) that exp( jk̄r′ ⋅̂o) ≈1 because k̄r′ ≪1. Now we can substitute
(10.35) into (10.32) and obtain the scattering amplitude ̄f. However, to express ̄f in a
more convenient form, let us note that the scattering is caused by the equivalent current
̄Jeq = j ωε0(εr −1) ̄E in (10.27). We may use the polarization vector ̄P = ̄Jeq∕jω and
the equivalent dipole moment ̄p of the sphere given by the integral of ̄P over the
volume V of the sphere.
̄p = ∫V
̄P dV′ = ∫V
ε0(εr −1) ̄E dV′ = 3(εr −1)
εr + 2 ε0 V ̄E𝑖.
(10.36)

We can then rewrite the scattering amplitude for Rayleigh scattering as follows:
̄f(̂o, ̂𝑖) =
k2
4πε0
[̄p −̂o(̂o ⋅̄p)],
(10.37)
where V is the volume of the sphere.
Note that ̄p −̂o(̂o ⋅̄p) is the component of ̄p perpendicular to ̂o, and therefore, its
magnitude is equal to p sin χ, where χ is the angle between ̄p and ̂o (Fig. 10.9). This
is to be expected as this represents the radiation pattern of the electric dipole ̄p. We
also note that (10.36) is valid even when the object is lossy and εr is complex. The
differential cross section σd(̂o, ̂𝑖) is given by
σd(̂o, ̂𝑖) =

V2 sin2 χ,
(10.38)
where sin2 χ = 1 −(̂o . ̂e𝑖)2.
We note that the cross section is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the
wavelength and directly proportional to the square of the volume of the scatterer.
These two characteristics of a small scatterer were derived by Rayleigh using dimen-
sional analysis and are generally known as Rayleigh scattering. The blue color of
the sky can be explained by noting that the blue portion of a light spectrum scatters
more light than the red portion due to the λ−4 dependence. Furthermore, the skylight
at right angles to the sun must be linearly polarized, as is evident from Fig. 10.9.
These two characteristics, the blue color and the polarization, were a great scientific
puzzle in the nineteenth century and were finally explained by Rayleigh (Kerker,
1969). Rayleigh noted that the scatterers need not be water or ice as was commonly
believed at that time, but that molecules of air itself can contribute to this scattering.
The redness of the sunset is caused by the decrease in the blue portion of the spectrum
due to Rayleigh scattering.

The Rayleigh equation above is valid only for small ka. The approximate upper limit
of the radius of the scatterer is generally taken to be a = 0.05λ. At this radius, the
percent error of the Rayleigh equation (10.40) is less than 4% (Kerker, 1969, p. 85).

The total cross section σt is the sum of (10.40) and (10.41). We note that σt cannot be
obtained by applying the forward scattering theorem to (10.37), since (10.37) gives
σt = 0 when ε′′
r = 0. In general, for a given approximate value of ̄E(̄r′) within an
object, the scattering cross section as obtained by integrating |f|2 in (10.32) or (10.37)
over 4π, plus the absorption cross section in (10.8) or (10.41), gives a much better
approximation to the total cross section than is obtained by direct application of the
forward scattering theorem to (10.32).

RAYLEIGH SCATTERING FOR A SMALL ELLIPSOIDAL OBJECT
Many of the particles and objects encountered in practice are not spherical, but they
can often be approximated by an ellipsoid whose surface is given by
x2
a2 + y2
b2 + z2
c2 = 1.
(10.42)
If the object size is small compared with a wavelength and the incident field ̄E𝑖has
components Eix, Eiy, and Eiz in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, the components
of the field inside the object are given by the following static solution (Stratton, 1941,

with an appropriate interchange of a, b, and c for Ey and Ez. It can be easily proved
that Lx, Ly, and Lz are functions of the ratio b/a and c/a only and do not depend on
the values of a, b, and c. It is also known that
Lx + Ly + Lz = 1.

[̄p −̂o(̂o ⋅̄p)],
(10.47)

̄p = αx E𝑖x ̂x + αy E𝑖y ̂y + αz E𝑖z ̂z,
αx =

αy and αz are obtained by replacing Lx by Ly and Lz, respectively. αx, αy, and αz are
the polarizability of the object for the x, y, and z directions.
As an example, consider a plane wave propagating in the direction (θ′, ϕ′) with
the components E′

There are several representations of Euler’s transformation and they are given by
Goldstein (1981). For axially symmetric objects with an axis oriented in the (θb, ϕb)
direction (Fig. 10.11), we have Lx = Ly and

(10.52)
We can then calculate [C1] and [C2] in terms of θ, ϕ, θ′, ϕ′, and θb, ϕb, noting that
̂θ = cos θ cos ϕ̂x + cos θ sin ϕ̂y −sin θ̂z,
̂ϕ = −sin ϕ̂x + cos ϕ̂y;
and ̂θ′ and ̂ϕ′ with θ′ and ϕ′ replacing θ and ϕ.
Let us consider the scattering and absorption cross sections for an axially sym-
metric object oriented in the x–z plane inclined with angle θb from the z axis which
is illuminated by the incident wave propagating in the z direction (Fig. 10.12). The
scattering cross section must be calculated by integrating ||̄f||
2 over all the solid angle
(see (10.6)) and the absorption cross section is obtained by (10.8). For nonspherical
objects, the scattering and absorption cross sections depend on the polarization of

RAYLEIGH–DEBYE SCATTERING (BORN APPROXIMATION)
We now consider the scattering characteristics of a scatterer whose relative dielec-

approximated by the incident field.
̄E(̄r) = ̄E𝑖(̄r) = ̂e𝑖exp(−jk̄r ⋅̂𝑖).

and θ is the angle between ̂𝑖and ̂o (Fig. 10.13).
This approximation is valid when
(εr −1)kD ≪1,
(10.58)
where D is a typical dimension of the object such as its diameter. We note that (10.57)
is a Fourier transform of [εr(r′) – 1] in the direction of ̄𝑖s. Therefore, the scattering
amplitude f(̂o, ̂𝑖) is proportional to the Fourier transform of [εr(r′) – 1] evaluated
at the wave number ̄ks. In general, if [εr(r′) – 1] is concentrated in a region that is
small compared with a wavelength, the cross section is spread out in ̄ks and thus in
angle θ, and the scattering is almost isotropic. If the object size is large compared to
a wavelength, the scattering is concentrated in a small forward angular region θ ≈0.
This situation is similar to the relationship between a time function and its frequency
spectrum. If a function is limited in time within T, its spectrum is spread out over a
frequency range 1/T.
The Rayleigh–Debye absorption cross section is obtained from (10.8).

ELLIPTIC POLARIZATION AND STOKES PARAMETERS
In Sections 10.1 through 10.7, we considered a linearly polarized incident wave.
In general, however, it is necessary to consider an incident wave with elliptic

polarization. Let us examine a plane wave propagating in the z direction, whose
electric field components as functions of time are given by
Ex = Re(E1 ejωt) = Re[a1 exp(jωt −jkz + jδ1)] = a1 cos (τ + δ1),
Ey = Re(E2 ejωt) = Re[a2 exp(jωt −jkz + jδ2)] = a2 cos (τ + δ2),
Ez = 0,
(10.68a)
where τ = ωt – kz, and E1 and E2 are the phasors for Ex and Ey.
In the above, we used the IEEE convention exp(jωt). In many studies using Stokes’
parameters, it is more common to use the exp(–iωt) convention. In this case, (10.68a)
should be written as
Ex = Re(E1 e−𝑖ωt) = Re[a1 exp(−𝑖ωt + 𝑖kz −𝑖δ1)] = a1 cos (τ + δ1),
Ey = Re(E2 e−𝑖ωt) = Re[a2 exp(−𝑖ωt + 𝑖kz −𝑖δ2)] = a2 cos (τ + δ2). (10.68b)
Now consider a general elliptically polarized wave. The endpoint of the electric
field vector ̄E = Ex ̂x + Ey ̂y traces an ellipse. The equation for this ellipse is obtained
by eliminating τ from (10.68a) or (10.68b).

To describe the elliptically polarized wave given in (10.68), three independent
parameters are needed. For example, they can be a1, a2, and δ. It is, however, more
convenient to use parameters of the same dimension. In 1852, G. G. Stokes introduced

E2 = a2 exp( j δ2 −jkz) = a2 exp(−𝑖δ2 + 𝑖kz).
Note that the upper and lower signs for V are for exp(jωt) and exp(–iωt) dependence,
respectively. Among these four parameters, there exists the relationship, obtained
from (10.70),
I2 = Q2 + U2 + V2.
(10.71)
Equations (10.70) and (10.71) together provide three independent quantities that
describe an elliptically polarized wave.

Right-handed elliptical polarization.
As an example, for a wave linearly polarized in the direction ψ0 with respect to the
x axis, we have a1 = E0 cos ψ0, a2 = E0 sin ψ0, and δ = 0, and the Stokes parameters
are
I = E2
0,
Q = E2
0 cos 2ψ0,
U = E2
0 sin 2ψ0,
V = 0.
(10.72)
For a right-handed circularly polarized wave, we have a1 = a2 = E0, δ = –π/2, and
I = 2E2
0,
Q = 0,
U = 0,
V = ±2E2
0.
(10.73)
Here the upper and lower signs for V are for exp(jωt) and exp(–iωt) dependence,
respectively. It is also common to use the modified Stokes parameters given by
I1 = ||E1||
2 ,
I2 = ||E2||
2 ,
U = 2 Re(E1 E∗
2),
V = 2 Im(E1 E∗
2).
(10.74)
Alternatively, it is possible to describe the ellipse in Fig. 10.17 in terms of the
semimajor (a) and the semiminor (b) axes of the ellipse and the orientation angle (ψ).
Using I, b/a, and ψ, the Stokes parameters become, for exp(–iωt) dependence,
Q = I cos 2χ cos 2ψ,
U = I cos 2χ sin 2ψ,
V = I sin 2χ,
(10.75)
where tan χ = ±b/a, with a plus sign for left-handed polarization and a minus sign
for right-handed polarization. The polarization is defined as right handed when the
electric field rotates as a right-handed screw advancing in the direction of propagation.
From (10.75), it is seen that I and V depend on the total intensity and the ellipticity
angle χ and are not affected by the orientation angle ψ of the ellipse, but Q and U
vary according to the choice of coordinates.
Equation (10.75) may be compared with the Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z) of a
point (r, θ, ϕ) on a sphere with radius r = I, θ = (π/2) – 2χ and ϕ = 2ψ, X = r sin θ

PARTIAL POLARIZATION AND NATURAL LIGHT
In the elliptic polarization discussed in Section 10.8, the ratio of the amplitudes a1
and a2, and the phase difference δ = δ2 – δ1 are absolute constants. This happens
when a wave is purely monochromatic (single frequency). In the more general case
of a polychromatic wave with a certain bandwidth Δω, the amplitudes and the phase
difference undergo continuous variations with various frequencies within Δω, and
therefore a1, a2, and δ are slowly varying random functions of time. In general,
therefore, the Stokes parameters should be expressed by the averages. Denoting the
time average by angular brackets, ⟨⋅⟩, we have, for exp(–iωt) dependence,
I = ⟨a2

(10.76)
For modified Stokes parameters (I1, I2, U, V), we have I1 = ⟨|E1|2⟩and I2 = ⟨|E2|2⟩.
In this case, the condition in (10.71) must be replaced by
I2 ≥Q2 + U2 + V2.

SCATTERING OF WAVES BY CONDUCTING AND DIELECTRIC OBJECTS
Natural light is characterized by the fact that the intensity is the same in any
direction perpendicular to the direction of the ray and that there is no correlation
between rectangular components of the field. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient
conditions for light to be natural are
I = 2 ⟨
|E|2⟩
and
Q = U = V = 0.
(10.78)
In general, a wave may be partially polarized. The degree of polarization m is
defined by the ratio
m = (Q2 + U2 + V2)1∕2
I
,
(10.79)
where m = 1 for elliptic polarization, 0 < m < 1 for partial polarization, and m = 0
for an unpolarized wave (natural light).
It is clear that the Stokes parameters [I] can always be expressed as the sum of the
elliptically polarized wave [Ip] and the unpolarized wave [Iu].

SCATTERING AMPLITUDE FUNCTIONS f11, f12, f21, AND f22 AND

(10.81a)
for a linearly polarized incident wave given by

(10.81b)
To generalize the description of the scattered wave to include elliptic, partially polar-
ized, and unpolarized waves, we may choose the following coordinate system (van
de Hulst, 1957). We use exp(–iωt) in this section. We choose the z axis to be the
direction of the incident wave, and the y–z plane to be the plane of scattering, defined
as the plane that includes the direction of the incident wave ̂𝑖and the observation ̂o

scattered wave in the direction ̂o has two components, EsX = Es⟂and EsY = Es∥,

related to the scattering functions S1, S2, S3, and S4 used by van de Hulst and in the

σs, the absorption cross section σa, and the total cross section σt are defined by exactly
the same formulas as shown in Section 10.1. The forward scattering theorem is
σt = −4π
k Im f(̂𝑖, ̂𝑖).
(10.90)
Integral representation of the scattering amplitude f(̂o, ̂𝑖) is somewhat different
from that for an electromagnetic wave because of the factor 1/ρ0 inside the divergence
operation in (2.131).
For a time-harmonic case with exp(jωt), (2.131) becomes
∇2p + k2p = −k2γκ p + div[γρ grad p],
(10.91)
where γκ = (κe – κ)/κ, γρ = (ρe – ρ)/ρe, k2 = ω2/c2 = ω2 κρ and κ and ρ are the
compressibility and the density, respectively, of the medium surrounding the object,
and κe and ρe are those of the object.

f(̂o, ̂𝑖) is given by

4π ∫V
(γκp + jγρ

(10.92)
where we used the divergence theorem to convert the integral involving the second
term of the right side of (10.91) to the second term of the integral of (10.92).
Using (10.92), we can obtain the following Born approximation:
f(̂o, ̂𝑖) = k2
4π ∫V
(γκ + γρ cos θ) exp(−j̄ks ⋅̄r′) dV′,
(10.93a)
where ̄ks = k(̂𝑖−̂o), ||̄ks|| = 2k sin (θ∕2), and cos θ = ̂𝑖⋅̂o. This is applicable to the
case

kD ≪1,
(10.93b)
where D is a typical size of the object.
It should be interesting to note that for a small object, the first term inside the
integral in (10.93) gives isotropic scattering similar to the electromagnetic case, but
the second term gives scattering proportional to ̂o ⋅̂𝑖= cos θ.

SCATTERING CROSS SECTION OF A CONDUCTING BODY
Many objects used in aerospace applications have conducting surfaces, examples
being airplanes, rockets, spacecraft, and missiles. It is, therefore, important to study
the scattering characteristics of a conducting body, particularly the backscattering
cross section for radar applications.
Let us first obtain the general formulation of this problem. Consider a conducting
surface S illuminated by an incident wave
̄E𝑖(r) = E𝑖e−jk̂𝑖⋅̄r̂e𝑖.
(10.95)
The scattered field ̄Es(r) is given by (see Section 10.3)
̄Es(r) = ∇× ∇× ̄πs(̄r),
̄Hs(r) = j ωε0∇× ̄πs(̄r),
(10.96)
where
̄πs(̄r) =
1
j ωε0 ∫S
G0(̄r, ̄r′) ̄Js(̄r′) da,
and ̄Js is the surface current on the surface of the conductor. Therefore, we get the
scattered field at a large distance from the object.
̄Es(̄r) = ̂esf(̂o, ̂𝑖)e−jkR

If the exact surface current ̄Js(̄r′) is known, the formulas above give the exact scat-
tering characteristics.
Let us next consider the radar cross section σb. As is usually the case, the antenna
receives the component of the scattered wave along the direction of the polarization
of the incident wave ̂e𝑖. Thus, in this case, we use

If the object is large compared with a wavelength and the surface is smooth (radius
of curvature is much greater than a wavelength), the surface current ̄Js(̄r) may be
well approximated by the current that would exist if the surface were a conducting
plane tangential to the surface at the point ̄r. Thus the surface is regarded to be locally
planar. In this case, in the illuminated region ̄Js is twice the tangential component of
the incident magnetic field.

Physical optics approximations give convenient and simple expressions for the
scattering cross section and therefore are widely used. The validity of this approx-
imation is limited to a large conducting object with a smooth surface. Unlike the
geometric optical approximation to be discussed later, the physical optics approxi-
mation contains wavelength dependence and the results are often in good agreement
with the experimental data, even though it is difficult to establish exactly how valid
physical optics is for a general case. Physical optics is equivalent to the Kirchhoff
approximation used in the aperture problems discussed in Sections 6.3 and 6.11.

MOMENT METHOD: COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
The physical optics approximation described in Section 10.13 gives a convenient
expression for the surface current, and thus it is widely used for many applications.
However, the approximation is valid only for a large object with a smooth surface.
For a small object, we need a different technique which can give a reasonable approx-
imation for the surface current. In this section, we start with a general formulation for
the integral equation for the surface current and apply the moment method to solve
for the surface current.
Let us first note that the total field ̄E(r) consists of the incident field ̄E𝑖(̄r) and the
field ̄Es scattered by the object.
̄E(r) = ̄E𝑖(r) + ̄Es(r),
(10.105)
where the scattered field ̄Es(r) is given by
̄Es(r) = ∇× ∇× ̄π(r)
=
1
jωε0
∇× ∇× ∫S
G0(̄r, ̄r′)Js(r′) da,
(10.106)
and G0(̄r, ̄r′) is a free-space Green’s function. Now the boundary condition requires
that the tangential component of ̄E(r) vanish on the surface of the conductor. There-
fore, we write
̄E(r)||tan = ̄E𝑖(r)||tan + ̄Es(r)||tan = 0,
(10.107)
on the surface S.
We write (10.107) in the following form:
L ( ̄Js) = ̄E𝑖||tan ,
(10.108)
where
̄Es(r)||tan = −L( ̄Js)
=
[
1
jωε0
∇× ∇× ∫S
G0(r, r′) ̄Js(r′) da
]
tan
.
Equation (10.108) is an integrodifferential equation for the surface current ̄Js. We
note that in this equation, ̄L and ̄E𝑖||tan are known and ̄Js is unknown. Let us solve
(10.108) by means of the moment method (see Chapter 18).
We expand the unknown current ̄Js(r) in a series of given current distributions
̄Jn(r) with unknown coefficients In.
̄Js(r) =
∑
n
In ̄Jn(r),
(10.109)

MOMENT METHOD: COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
351
where ̄Jn(r) is called the basis function. Substituting (10.109) into (10.108), we get
∑
n
InL( ̄Jn(r)) = ̄E𝑖||tan .
(10.110)
Now we choose a set of testing functions ̄W1, ̄W2, … , which are tangential vectors
on S. We form the inner product of both sides of (10.110) with ̄Wm.
∑
n
In⟨̄Wm, L( ̄Jn)⟩= ⟨̄Wm, ̄E𝑖⟩,
(10.111)
where the inner product is defined by
⟨̄Wm, ̄E⟩= ∫S

⟨W1, L(J2)⟩
⋯
⟨W2, L(J1)⟩
⟨W2, L(J2)⟩
⋯
]
,
(10.113)
we can write (10.111) in the following matrix form:
ZI = V.
(10.114)
We note here that once we choose the basis function ̄Jn(r) and the testing functions
̄Wm(r), the matrices Z and V are known and I is unknown. Thus, inverting the matrix
Z, we obtain the solution
I = Z−1 V.
(10.115)
The surface current ̄J(r) is then given by
̄J(r) =
∑
n
In ̄Jn(r).
(10.116)
As an example, let us consider the scattering by a thin wire of length l and diameter
2a (l ≫a) (Fig. 10.24). Noting that ̄Js(r′) has only the z component, we write
̄Js(r′) da = Iz(z′) dz′ ̂z.
(10.117)
Here we assume that the current Iz(z′) is a line current on the axis of the wire, but
that the boundary condition is to be satisfied on the surface of the wire (Fig. 10.25).
This convenient approximation avoids the singularity of Green’s function at ̄r = ̄r′.

We now divide the length l into N – 1 sections and choose the basis function
̄Jn(r) to be a rectangular current P(z – zn) in the nth section of the wire. Thus I(z) is
approximated by a series of steps with the value at the midpoint in each section (Fig.
10.24). Note that section 1 and section N are extended beyond the wire by Δ/2. We
can then let I1 = IN = 0, which is the condition required at the end of the wire. We

CHAPTER 11
WAVES IN CYLINDRICAL
STRUCTURES, SPHERES,
AND WEDGES
Many bodies of practical interest, such as biological media, rockets, and portions of
aircraft, may be closely approximated by cylindrical structures, spheres, and wedges.
These shapes are well defined and coincide with one or more of the coordinates for
which wave equations are separable. The exact solutions can be obtained in closed
form for most problems. These bodies may have radiators such as slot antennas and
dipole antennas on or close to their surface, and their radiation characteristics are
greatly affected by the geometry of the body. Also, the scattering and absorption
characteristics of these bodies, when illuminated from outside, are important in many
practical problems, such as radar cross-section studies and microwave hazards. In
this chapter, we investigate the scattering of waves from these objects and the effects
of these structures on the radiation characteristics of antennas.
In analyzing various problems in this chapter, we present a number of powerful
analytical techniques, including the Fourier transform, saddle-point technique, Wat-
son transform, residue series representation, and geometric optical solutions. These
techniques are useful not only for these problems, but are also important mathemati-
cal tools applicable to a large number of other problems. (See Bowman et al. (1969)
for detailed treatments of these topics.)

a vehicle with a specified radar cross section. Since many objects and vehicles are
composed of cylindrical layers, it is important to devise a systematic technique to
find scattered waves from such an object when a plane wave is incident on it. Let us
consider first an incident plane wave propagating in the direction (θ0, ϕ0). We may
consider two cases: TM and TE. The TM wave is polarized in a plane parallel to the
z axis and therefore Hz = 0. The TE wave is polarized perpendicular to the z axis and
thus Ez = 0. We let E0 be the magnitude of the incident electric field (Fig. 11.1).
Let us consider the TM incident wave. Note that the TM wave has the following
electric field components in the cylindrical coordinates (ρ, ϕ, z).
Ez𝑖= E0 sin θ0e−j̄k⋅̄r,
Eρ𝑖= −E0 cos θ0 cos(ϕ −ϕ0)e−j̄k⋅̄r,
Eϕ𝑖= E0 cos θ0 sin(ϕ −ϕ0)e−j̄k⋅̄r,
(11.1)
where
̄k = k(sin θ0 cos ϕ0̂x + sin θ0 sin ϕ0̂y + cos θ0̂z),
̄r = x̂x + ŷy + ẑz
= ρ cos ϕ̂x + ρ sin ϕ̂y + ẑz,
̄k ⋅̄r = kz cos θ0 + kρ sin θ0 cos(ϕ −ϕ0).

PLANE WAVE INCIDENT ON A CONDUCTING CYLINDER
359
Now the TM wave is generated by
Πz𝑖= A𝑖e−j̄k⋅̄r = A𝑖e−jkz cos θ0−jkρ sin θ0 cos(ϕ−ϕ0),
(11.2)
and Ez and Πz are related by
Ez𝑖=

Πz𝑖

(11.3)
Comparing (11.3) with (11.1), we get
A𝑖=

.
(11.4)
We will observe shortly that the incident wave (11.2) is not convenient to satisfy
the boundary condition in order to determine the scattered wave, and it is necessary
to expand the incident wave in a Fourier series in ϕ. Let us expand (11.2) in a Fourier
series.
Πz𝑖=

The coefficient an is obtained by

ejZ cos ϕ+jn(ϕ−π∕2)dϕ,
J−n(Z) = (−1)nJn(Z) = Jn(−Z).
(11.7)
We then get
an = A𝑖e−jkz cos θ0Jn(kρ sin θ0)e−jn(π∕2).
(11.8)
Thus Πzi in (11.2) is expressed in the following form:
Πz𝑖=

WAVES IN CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURES, SPHERES, AND WEDGES
Let us consider the scattering by a conducting cylinder of radius a when the TM
wave (11.9) is incident. We write the scattered wave in terms of the Hertz potential Πzs.
Considering that they should satisfy the wave equation and the radiation condition,
we write
Πzs =

∑
n=−∞
Anse−jkz cos θ0H(2)
n (kρ sin θ0)e−jn[ϕ−ϕ0+(π∕2)],
(11.10)
where Ans are the unknown coefficients to be determined by the boundary condition.
The boundary conditions are that Ez and Eϕ must be zero at ρ = a. This requires
that the total Πz = Πzi + Πzs be zero at ρ = a. Thus we get
Ans = −Jn(ka sin θ0)
H(2)
n (ka sin θ0)

(11.11)
The total Hertz potential Πz is given by

(11.14)

Let us next consider the TE wave incident on the cylinder. We use the magnetic
Hertz potential Πmz and write the incident wave as
Πmz𝑖= B𝑖e−j̄k⋅̄r = B𝑖e−jkz cos θ0−jkρ sin θ0 cos(ϕ−ϕ0),

∑

(11.19)
Equations (11.12) and (11.19) are the total fields due to the incident TM and TE
waves, respectively. All the electric and magnetic field components are then easily
obtained from them. Note that the incident TM wave Ai produces the scattered TM
wave only, and the incident TE wave Bi produces the TE wave only, and that there
is no coupling between the TM and TE modes. This is true only for certain special
cases such as a conducting cylinder or normal incidence on a dielectric cylinder. In
general, as can be seen in section 11.2, the incident TM wave can produce both TM
and TE scattered waves.

Here the z dependence exp(–jkz cos θ0) is the same as that of the incident field because
the boundary conditions must be satisfied at all z. This requires that

The boundary conditions are that Ez, Eϕ, Hz, and Hϕ, are continuous at ρ = a. Since
Ez =

The Eqs. (11.24)–(11.27) can be solved for the four unknown coefficients Asn, Bsn,
Aen, and Ben. They are then substituted into (11.21) and (11.22) to obtain the final
solution for Π and Πm and the fields are then given by (11.13) with the appropriate k
and ε in each region.
A similar procedure can be used for a layered dielectric cylinder. Let εm and km
be the relative dielectric constant and the wave number of the cylindrical layer with
radius from am–1 to am. Then the field (Ez, Hz, Eϕ, Hϕ) at am – 1 is related to the field
at am by a 4 × 4 matrix. We can then apply the boundary condition and obtain the
complete solution.
11.3
AXIAL DIPOLE NEAR A CONDUCTING CYLINDER
Dipole and loop antennas are often used in the vicinity of cylindrical structures. In this
section, we investigate the radiation from an axial dipole located near the conducting
cylinder (Fig. 11.3). We first consider the field produced by a dipole in free space.
We take an axial electric dipole located at r′, (ρ′, ϕ′, z′). The rectangular components
of the Hertz potential satisfy the scalar wave equation
(∇2 + k2)Πz = −Jz

(11.28)
The axial electric dipole of current I and length L is represented by
Jz = ILδ(r −r′)

Equation (11.34) with (11.35) gives the complete expression of the scattered field
due to the conducting cylinder of radius a excited by a dipole at (ρ′, ϕ′, z′). They
are expressed as an inverse Fourier transform with the contour c of integration in the
complex h plane.
Note first that the integrand contains λ, and therefore we need to consider whether
we should take λ = +(k2 – h2)1/2 or λ = –(k2 – h2)1/2. This requires study of the branch
points and Riemann surfaces discussed in Appendix 11.A. In general, the integrand
is not single valued because of λ = ±(k2 – h2)1/2. To assure a single value for the
integrand, we draw branch cuts from the branch points h = ±k such as thoseshown in
Fig. 11.4 or 11.5. As long as the contour does not cross the branch cuts, the integrand
is single valued (see Appendix 11.B).

The last expression in (11.37) is convenient for the radiation field from cylindri-
cal structures because Eϕ and Hϕ are the same in both cylindrical and spherical
coordinates. Eϕ and Hϕ are calculated from the Hertz potential.
Let us consider the radiation field of an axial dipole near a conducting cylinder,
which was discussed in detail in Section 11.3. Eϕ and Hϕ are then obtained from
(11.30), (11.32), and (11.34). For ρ > ρ′ we get

We now wish to evaluate this integral for an observation point far from the origin
(i.e., kR large). Let us first recognize that at both ends of the contour, the integrand
vanishes. In the example we are considering,
cos (α −θc) = cos (x + jy)
= cos x cosh y −j sin x sinh y,
(11.45)
and the absolute value becomes
|||e−jkR cos (α−θc)||| = e−kR sin x sinh y,
which vanishes for 0 < x < π and y →+∞and for –π < x < 0 and y →–∞. In Fig.
11.7, the component (–kR sin x sinh y) is shown. We note that the original contour
starts from a point in the valley where the exponent is –∞and thus the magnitude is
zero, along path C the magnitude increases, and finally, the magnitude decreases to
zero in another valley region. Along this original contour C, both real and imaginary
parts of the exponent vary. We therefore deform the path into the steepest descent
contour (SDC) along which the imaginary part of the exponent is constant (Figs. 11.7
and 11.8) and evaluate the integral for large kR (see Appendix 11.C).
We have
f(α) = −j cos (α −θc),
(11.46)
and thus the saddle point is at
df
dα = j sin(α −θc) = 0,
(11.47)
which gives αs = θc.

We must choose γ such that the second term is real and negative. Thus we require
that
2γ + π
2 = ±π,
which gives γ = π/4 or –3π/4. γ = π/4 represents the path going from the third to the
first quadrant and γ = –3π/4 is the path from the first to the third quadrant. Both are
steepest descent paths, but obviously in our problem, the choice must be
γ = π

We now go back to (11.38) and (11.39) and obtain the radiation field. Using (11.49),
we first note that Eϕ has R–2 dependence while Hϕ has R–1 dependence for large kR.
This means that Eϕ diminishes faster than Hϕ, and therefore, Hϕ and Eθ are the only
components of the radiation field. We thus get, using (11.49),

This relationship (11.54) states that the integral of the square of the magnitude of
a periodic function is the sum of the square of the magnitude of each harmonic
component, and this is called Parseval’s theorem. An example is the total power
delivered to a resistor by a periodic current. There is no coupling between different

frequency component.

LARGE CYLINDERS AND THE WATSON TRANSFORM
In previous sections 11.4, 11.5, and 11.6, the waves in cylindrical structures were
given in terms of the Fourier series in ϕ and the Fourier transform in the z direc-
tion. These formal solutions are called harmonic series representations. There are
two considerations associated with harmonic series representations which make it
difficult to use them in many practical problems. One is that even if a solution is
obtained in a harmonic series form, evaluation of the actual field quantities requires
the truncation of an infinite series and thus the knowledge of its convergence. It
is therefore desirable to have alternative representations which may have different
convergence characteristics. This is particularly important because it is often time
consuming and expensive to obtain sufficient accuracy in evaluating various Bessel
functions of large order by computers.
Second, the harmonic series representation can be obtained only for a small
number of structures, whose surfaces coincide with the 11 coordinate systems where
the wave equation is separable (rectangular, cylindrical, elliptic cylinder, parabolic
cylinder, spherical, conical, parabolic, prolate spheroidal, oblate spheroidal, ellip-
soidal, and paraboloidal; see Morse and Feshback, p. 656). Thus it is important to
develop an alternative representation that may be useful in describing waves for more
practical and complex shapes. The Watson transform technique described in this
section offers this alternative representation which may be used for more complex
problems (Chapter 13).
Let us first illustrate the problem associated with large cylinders by taking radiation
from a dipole shown in (11.50). We recognize that in calculating the radiation pattern,
we need to deal with the infinite series
S =
∞
∑
n=−∞
f(n)e−jnϕ.
(11.58)
The calculation of this series can be done by summing a finite number of terms
instead of infinite terms and if the series is reasonably convergent, the finite sum
should give a good solution. The important question then is: How many terms are
required to represent the sum adequately? Problems involving cylinders and spheres
actually contain the Bessel functions with the argument of the order of magnitude of
www.ebook3000.com

374
WAVES IN CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURES, SPHERES, AND WEDGES
ka, where a is the radius or size of the object. Bessel functions behave quite differently
depending on whether the argument is much less than, approximately equal to, or
much greater than the order. Because of this, in general, series of the type (11.58)
require at least two ka terms to represent the sum within a few percent accuracy.
For a large cylinder, not only must the large number of terms be summed, but these
terms contain Bessel functions of a large argument and large order. In many practical
problems, this presents a formidable computational problem.
It would be extremely useful if series of the type (11.58) can be converted into a
fast convergent series for large ka, so that only a few terms are required for obtaining
numerical results. This is done by the Watson transform technique described in
this section. Historically, shortwave radio-wave propagation over the earth was one
of the central practical problems in the early twentieth century. The calculation
was particularly difficult because of the extremely large ka value for the earth. In
1919, G.N. Watson successfully devised this technique, which converted the slow
convergent series to a fast convergent series (Bremmer, 1949, p. 6).
First, let us consider the integral
I = ∫C1+C2
A(v)
sin vπ dv.
(11.59)
The integrand has poles at v = n integers, and thus the integral may be evaluated by
taking the residues at each pole. The contour C1 + C2 encloses 2N + 1 poles. We then
let N →∞(Fig. 11.9). We get

by the following complex integral (Wait, 1959, Chapters 8 and 9):

LARGE CYLINDERS AND THE WATSON TRANSFORM
375
Many series representations for problems involving cylindrical and spherical struc-
tures can be transformed into the complex integral of this form. This transformation
(11.61) is called the Watson transform.
The original series (11.58) is called the harmonic series and is obviously adequate
for small cylinders. For large cylinders, however, the convergence of the harmonic
series is too slow and the integral (11.61) is more useful. There are three ways to
proceed from the integral form of (11.61). Each provides a good representation in
different regions of space. The three approaches are
1. Residue series representation: The integral (11.61) may be evaluated at the poles
of f(v), yielding a series of residues. This representation is highly convergent,
requiring only a few terms in the shadow region. In this region, the wave creeps
along the surface and is called the creeping wave.
2. Geometric optical representation: The integral (11.61) may be evaluated by
means of the saddle-point technique, which gives a simple and useful repre-
sentation in the illuminated region.
3. Fock function representation: In the boundary region between the illuminated
and the shadow region, the two preceding techniques are not applicable and the
technique developed by Fock must be used.
The three regions discussed above are shown in Fig. 11.10. We now examine each
of the three techniques.

The evaluation of the integral (11.61) can be made by deforming the contour C1 to

at v = vm, the poles of f(v). The last expression in (11.63) is called the residue series.
Let us first examine the locations of the poles vm of f(v). Note that the denominator
of f(v) is H(2)
v (ka sin θ) in (11.50). Therefore, the poles are given by
H(2)
vm (ka sin θ) = 0.

(11.67)
Let us examine the residue series (11.66). The first series due to the poles at vm has
the angular dependence e−jvmϕ. As shown in (11.65), vm has the real part somewhat
greater than z = ka sin θ and the negative imaginary part. We therefore have
e−jvmϕ = e−jvmrϕ−vm𝑖ϕ,
vm = vmr −jvm𝑖.
(11.68)
When θ = π/2, vmr > ka, and therefore, vmrϕ > ka ϕ. Since ϕ is the distance along
the surface, letting vmr = βa, where β is the phase constant for the wave propagating
along the surface, we get β > k, indicating that the phase velocity along the surface
is less than the velocity of light. Therefore, the first series represents the wave that
propagates with a phase velocity slower than the velocity of light on the surface
with attenuation. The second series in (11.66), corresponding to –vm, represents the
wave propagating in the opposite direction with the same propagation constant. These
waves creep along the surface and are called the creeping waves (Fig. 11.13).
We may also note that the original harmonic series representation has the form

which is a Fourier series representation in the interval 0 < ϕ < 2π. We may write
this as a series of cos nϕ and sin nϕ. Then, we recognize that the harmonic series is
in essence the representation of the wave in a series of standing waves (sin nϕ and
cos nϕ) around the cylinder. It is obvious, then, that for a small cylinder, since the
wave has little ϕ variation, a small number of terms of the harmonic series should
give a reasonable representation of the field. On the other hand, for a large cylinder,
the wave radiated from a slot propagates along the cylinder surface and attenuates as
it radiates the energy due to the curvature, and thus the wave is essentially a traveling
wave along the surface. It is then clear that the suitable representation is the residue
series because each term e−jvmϕ is a traveling-wave representation, and it requires
only a few terms to describe the wave adequately.
11.9
POISSON’S SUM FORMULA, GEOMETRIC OPTICAL REGION,
AND FOCK REPRESENTATION
Before we discuss the wave in the geometric optical region, let us discuss an alternative
representation of the series (11.58), which we write as
S =
∞
∑
n=−∞
F(n).
(11.69)
We will show in this section that the sum (11.69) can be represented as a sum of the
Fourier transform G(m) of F(n) in the following form:

where
G(m) = ∫

−∞
F(v)e−j2mπv dv.
This is called Poisson’s sum formula. It is useful when the original series is slowly
convergent, but the series of the transform is fast convergent.
To prove this, we start with the Watson transform
S =

∑
n=−∞
F(n)

2j ∫C1+C2
F(v)ejvπ
sin vπ dv.
(11.71)
We write this in a somewhat different way. Along C1, we note that Im v < 0. Thus
|e–jvπ| < 1. Therefore, we write
1
sin vπ =
2j
ejvπ(1 −e−2jvπ)

where
G(m) = ∫C1

Along C2, Im v > 0. Thus |ejvπ| < 1. Therefore,

Thus we get

(11.73)
Consider Sm for m > 0. The difference between Sm and S0 is that Sm has the additional
2mπ to the angle ϕ, and thus Sm represents the wave encircling the cylinder m times
(Fig. 11.14a). On the other hand, when m < 0, letting v = –v′ and m = –m′, we get
Sm = S−m′ = ∫

This is recognized as the wave encircling the cylinder in the opposite direction
(Fig. 11.14b).
In the illuminated region (Fig. 11.10), it is clear that the major contribution to
the field comes from the S0 term. It is then possible to evaluate S0 by means of the
saddle-point technique, and this leads to the geometric optical solution.

between the shadow and the illuminated region cannot be adequately represented
by the residue series or the geometric optical representations. In this region, it is
important to consider the order v of the Hankel function close to its argument z.
Making use of the Hankel approximation, it is possible to represent the field in this
region in terms of a function proposed by Fock. The details are given in Wait’s book
(1959, pp. 64–68).

MIE SCATTERING BY A DIELECTRIC SPHERE
The exact solution of the scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave by an isotropic,
homogeneous dielectric sphere of arbitrary size is usually referred to as Mie theory,
even though Lorenz gave essentially the same results before Mie’s work (Kerker,
1969, Section 3.4). In this chapter, we employ a technique using the radial components
of electric and magnetic hertz vectors. This technique differs from the vector wave
equation formulation by Stratton, but it has the definite advantage of working with
the scalar wave equations.
In spherical coordinates, it is possible to express the complete electromagnetic
field in terms of two scalar functions π1 and π2. They are the radial components of
the electric and magnetic Hertz vectors (see Section 4.15).
̄πe = π1 ̂r
and
̄πm = π2 ̂r.
(11.75)
π1 produces all the TM modes with Hr = 0 and π2 produces all the TE modes with
Er = 0. π1 and π2 satisfy the scalar wave equation.
(∇2 + k2)π1 = 0,
(∇2 + k2)π2 = 0.
(11.76)

The electric and magnetic fields are derived from these two scalar functions.
̄E = ∇× ∇× (r π1 ̂r) −jωμ∇× (r π2 ̂r),
̄H = jωε∇× (r π1 ̂r) + ∇× ∇× (r π2 ̂r).

(11.78)
We now consider a sphere with a complex dielectric constant ε1 and a permeability
μ1 immersed in a medium with ε2 and μ2 (Fig. 11.15). The incident wave is polarized
in the x direction and is given by
̄Einc(z) = e−jk2z ̂x.
(11.79)
Let us consider the boundary conditions. At r = a, the tangential electric and
magnetic fields must be continuous, and therefore, designating the field inside by ̄E1

and ̄H1 and the field outside by ̄E2 and ̄H2, we write the boundary conditions at r =
a.
E1θ = E2θ,
E1ϕ = E2ϕ,
H1θ = H2θ,
H1ϕ = H2ϕ.
(11.80)
As can be seen from (11.78), the boundary conditions above contain a mixture of π1
and π2. Therefore, it is convenient to reduce them into the boundary conditions on
π1 alone and π2 alone. To do this, we note that if we take a linear combination of Eθ
and Eϕ in the following manner, the terms containing π2 drop out and the condition
becomes the continuity of

across the boundary r = a. Since this must hold for any θ and ϕ, we require that
∂(rπ1)/∂r be continuous at r = a.
Similarly, considering ∂Eθ/∂ϕ – ∂(sin θ Eϕ)/∂θ, we obtain the boundary condition
that μπ2 be continuous at r = a. Similar considerations for Hθ and Hϕ give the
boundary condition that ∂(rπ2)/∂r and επ1 be continuous at r = a.
Let us now express the incident field ̄Einc in terms of spherical harmonics. We
observe that ̄Einc can be derived from two scalar functions π𝑖
1 and π𝑖
2 that satisfy the
wave equation. General expressions for π𝑖

n as it is finite at θ = 0 and π.
In order to determine the constants A(1)
mn, A(2)
mn, B(1)

Here we used the following:

[rzn(kr)] = 0,
(11.84)
where zn(kr) is any spherical Bessel function.
The expansion of Eir in (11.82) can be done in the following manner. First, we
note that
e−jkr cos θ =
∞
∑
n=0
(−j)n(2n + 1)jn(kr)Pn(cos θ).
(11.85)
This is obtained by expanding exp(–jkr cos θ) in spherical harmonics,
exp(−jkr cos θ) =

∑
n=0
an(r)Pn(cos θ),
and noting that Pn(cos θ) are orthogonal and using the relationship

∫
π

[Pn(cos θ)]2 sin θ dθ =

We then obtain the expansion of Eir from (11.85) by noting that
E𝑖r = 1
jkr
∂
∂θ exp(−jkr cos θ) cos ϕ,
∂
∂θPn(cos θ) = −P1

We now have the expressions for the incident Hertz potentials, (11.87) and (11.88).
Next, we write the general expressions for the scattered fields and satisfy the boundary
conditions. We note that the boundary conditions are such that π1 outside the sphere
couples only to π1 inside the sphere. Thus since π𝑖
1 has cos ϕ dependence, we expect
that the scattered field and the field inside the sphere have the same dependence on
ϕ. Similarly, all π2 should have sin ϕ dependence.
Therefore, the general expressions for the scattered fields should be

We can, however, extend the foregoing analysis to scattering by a sphere consisting of
many concentric dielectric layers by expressing π1 and π2 using linear combinations
of two spherical Bessel functions with two unknowns in each layer instead of one
spherical function shown in (11.90).

AXIAL DIPOLE IN THE VICINITY OF A CONDUCTING WEDGE
Dipoles located in the vicinity of a wedge (Fig. 11.16) have a number of practical
applications. Examples are antennas located near a sharp edge such as aircraft wings
or fins and antennas with a corner reflector. In this section, we study the radiation
characteristics of an axial dipole affected by a conducting wedge of given angle.

Using the results given in Section 11.1, we can obtain the exact solution for a wave
excited by a line source and for a wave excited by a plane wave in the presence of a
wedge. This solution is important in the study of the geometric theory of diffraction
(GTD), discussed in Chapter 13. Let us consider a conducting wedge excited by an
electric line current I0 located at ̄r′ = (ρ, θ𝑖) (Fig. 11.17). The electric field Ez at

Equations (11.113)–(11.117) give the exact solution for the total field for a conducting
wedge when excited by a line source. Equations (11.120) and (11.121) give the exact
total field for a wedge when excited by a plane wave. These are the exact series
solutions, but in some practical problems, it is necessary to obtain the simpler closed-
form solutions. A convenient closed-form exact solution is possible only for a plane
wave incident on a knife edge (half-plane) Ψ0 = 2π. For other cases, such as a plane
wave incident on a wedge Ψ0≠2π and a line source excitation, we can obtain some
convenient approximate expressions.

HALF-PLANE EXCITED BY A PLANE WAVE
For a half-plane (knife edge), we let Ψ0 = 2π in (11.120) and (11.121) and obtain
the exact solution. However, this half-plane diffraction problem was first solved by
Sommerfeld in 1896 and the solution was given in terms of the Fresnel integral.
The problem has also been solved by the Wiener–Hopf technique (see James, 1976;
Jull, 1981; Noble, 1958). Here we give the final expressions and refer readers to the
references above for the details.
For a plane wave polarized in the z direction incident on a half-plane from the

CHAPTER 12
SCATTERING BY COMPLEX OBJECTS
In Chapter 10, we discussed some of the approximate methods of calculating scat-
tering by simple objects such as Rayleigh scattering and Rayleigh–Debye scattering.
In Chapter 11, we discussed exact solutions for simple objects such as cylinders and
spheres. In many practical situations, the objects often have a complex shape and
the size and the dielectric constant are such that the simple solutions discussed in
Chapters 10 and 11 are not applicable. Several methods that have been developed
to deal with these problems will be discussed. In this chapter, we start with inte-
gral equation formulations for scalar fields for Dirichlet, Neumann, and two-media
problems. Electric field integral equation (EFIE) and magnetic field integral equa-
tion (MFIE) are discussed next, followed by the T-matrix method. We then discuss
inhomogeneous dielectric media, including Green’s dyadic. We conclude this chapter
with aperture diffraction problems, small apertures, and Babinet’s principle. For radar
cross sections, see Ruck et al. (1970). Aperture problems are discussed in Maanders
and Mittra (1977), Rahmat-Samii and Mittra (1977), Arvas and Harrington (1983),
and Butler et al. (1978). Low-frequency scattering (Kleinman, 1978; van Bladel,
1968; Stevenson, 1953; Senior, 1984) and narrow strips and slots (Butler and Wilton,
1980; Senior, 1979) are also discussed in this chapter. For dyadic Green’s functions,
see Tai (1971), Yaghjian (1980), and Livesay and Chen (1974). Also see Lewin et al.
(1977) for curved structures.

SCALAR SURFACE INTEGRAL EQUATIONS FOR SOFT AND
HARD SURFACES
In Section 6.1, we used Huygens’ principle and obtained the expressions for the field
in terms of the incident wave and the contribution from the surface field. In this
section we make use of these relationships to obtain the surface integral equations
when the object is a soft body or a hard body. A penetrable homogeneous body is
discussed in the Section 12.2. There are two surface equations. One relates the field
to the surface integral and the other relates the normal derivative of the field to the
surface integral.
12.1.1
Integral Equation for a Soft Body
If the object is a soft body, the boundary condition is Dirichlet’s type.
ψ(̄r) = 0
on the surface.
(12.1)
Now we make use of (6.11) (Fig. 12.1).

if ̄r is on the surface S.

We then use the boundary condition (12.1), and we get

(12.3)
where
G0(̄r, ̄r′) = exp(−jk ||̄r −̄r′||)

and ̄r and ̄r′ are on the surface S.

SCALAR SURFACE INTEGRAL EQUATIONS FOR SOFT AND HARD SURFACES
403
Note that as ̄r′ approaches ̄r, G0 becomes infinite, and therefore this is an improper
integral. However, as is shown in Appendix 12.A, the integral is convergent as G0 is
proportional to R−1, where R = |̄r −̄r′| and the surface integral is convergent if the
integrand is R−α and 0 < α < 2. Thus this is a weakly singular integral equation.
Equation (12.3) is the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind for the unknown
function ∂ψ/∂n′ (see Appendix 12.B).
Alternatively, we can obtain the Fredholm equation of the second kind. To do this,
we take the normal derivative of (6.9) and let ̄r approach the surface S. As shown in
Appendix 12.A, we get

(12.5)
where both ̄r and ̄r′ are on the surface S. This is the desired Fredholm integral
equation of the second kind. It can be proved that the integral is convergent (see
Appendix 12.A).
12.1.2
Integral Equations for a Hard Body
The boundary condition at the surface of a hard body is the Neumann type.
∂ψ
∂n = 0.
(12.6)
From (6.11), we get the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for ψ(̄r).
ψ𝑖(̄r) + ⨍S
ψ(̄r′) = ∂G0(̄r, ̄r′)
∂n′
dS′ = 1
2ψ(̄r).
(12.7)
The integral is convergent (see Appendix 12.A).
We can also obtain the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind.

∂n
+ ∂
∂n ∫ψ(̄r′)∂G0(̄r, ̄r′)

dS′ = 0.
(12.8)
The kernel in this case is singular (see Appendix 12.A).
We note that in the formulations above, the scattered field satisfies the radiation
condition because we used Green’s function G0, which is outgoing and satisfies the
radiation condition. The field on the surface should also satisfy the edge condition if
the surface contains edges and corners.

404
SCATTERING BY COMPLEX OBJECTS
In the above, we have two integral equations, (12.3) and (12.5), for soft objects.
We can use either one to obtain the solution. However, the second kind (12.5) is often
more stable in numerical calculations. Also note that if the surface integral in (12.5)
is negligibly small, we get the Kirchhoff approximation,
∂ψ
∂n ≃2∂ψ𝑖
∂n .
(12.9)
Similarly, for the hard surface, (12.7) is more convenient and the Kirchhoff approx-
imation is obtained immediately by neglecting the surface integral.
ψ(̄r) ≃2ψ𝑖(̄r).
(12.10)
12.2
SCALAR SURFACE INTEGRAL EQUATIONS FOR A
PENETRABLE HOMOGENEOUS BODY
Let us now consider the scattering of a scalar acoustic wave incident from the media
with density ρ0 and sound velocity c0 on a homogeneous body with ρ1 and c1. This is
sometimes called the two-media problem (Fig. 12.2). We use the field ψ to designate
the velocity potential. Then we have
(∇2 + k2
0
) ̄ψ0 = 0
outside the body
(∇2 + k2
1
) ̄ψ1 = 0
inside the body.
(12.11)
The boundary conditions on S are
ρ0 ψ0 = ρ1 ψ1
and
∂ψ0
∂n = ∂ψ1
∂n .
(12.12)
On the surface S, there are two unknowns: ψ0 and ∂ψ0/∂n (or ψ1 and ∂ψ1/∂n). We
will therefore develop two coupled surface integral equations for ψ0 and ∂ψ0/∂n.

SCALAR SURFACE INTEGRAL EQUATIONS FOR A PENETRABLE HOMOGENEOUS BODY

First, consider the region outside the body. As the observation point ̄r approaches
the surface S from outside, we get (see Eq. 6.11)
ψ𝑖(̄r) + ⨍S
(
ψ0(̄r′)∂G0(̄r, ̄r′)

2ψ0(̄r),
(12.13)
where
G0(̄r, ̄r′) = exp(−jk0 ||̄r −̄r′||)
4π |̄r −̄r′|
.
Next we use the same formula (12.11) for the region inside the body and let ̄r
approach the surface S from inside.
⨍S

ψ1(̄r′)∂G1(̄r, ̄r′)

(12.14)
where
G1(̄r, ̄r′) = exp(−jk1|̄r −̄r′|)
4π|̄r −̄r′|
.
Note that the right side is −1
2ψ1 rather than + 1
2ψ1 because ∂/∂n′ is now a normal
derivative in the direction toward the outside. Now using the boundary conditions,
we can rewrite (12.14) as follows:
⨍S

(12.15)
Equations (12.13) and (12.15) give two integral equations for two unknowns ψ0(̄r′)
and ∂ψ0(̄r′∕∂n′). Then the two equations can be solved numerically.
Alternatively, we take the normal derivative of (6.9) and let ̄r approach the surface
S. We then get
∂ψ𝑖(̄r)

(12.17)

SCATTERING BY COMPLEX OBJECTS
We note that both (12.16) and (12.17) contain singular kernels, due to the first integral
term of (12.16) and the first term of (12.17).
Note also that we have four equations, (12.13), (12.15)–(12.17). The first two
relate the field outside and inside the surface to the surface integral and the last
two relate the normal derivatives of the field outside and inside the surface to the
surface integral. We can make different combinations of these four equations to obtain
different integral equations with various degrees of computational advantages.
12.3
EFIE AND MFIE
Let us consider an electromagnetic wave ( ̄E𝑖, ̄H𝑖) incident on a perfectly conducting
body with surface S (Fig. 12.3). There are two surface integral equations. The equation
in terms of the electric field is called EFIE and the equation in terms of the magnetic
field is called MFIE.
EFIE is obtained by using the surface integral representation (6.111) and imposing
the boundary condition.
̄E𝑖(̄r) + ⨍S
̄Es dS′ = 1
2 ̄E(̄r).
(12.18)
The boundary condition on S is
̂n′ × ̄E(̄r) = 0.
(12.19)
Therefore, we get
̂n′ × ̄E𝑖(̄r) + ̂n′ × ⨍
̄EsdS′ = 0,
(12.20)
where
̄Es = −[jωμG(̂n′ × ̄H) −(̂n′ × ̄E) × ∇′G −(̂n′ ⋅̄E)∇′G].

Noting that ̂n′ × ̄H = ̄Js = Surface current, ̂n′ ⋅̄E = ρs∕ε, ρs = surface charge, and
using the continuity condition
∇s ⋅̄Js + jωρs = 0,
where ∇s is the surface divergence, we get the following EFIE for the surface
current ̄Js:
̂n′ × ̄E𝑖(̄r) =
1
jωε ̂n′ × ⨍S
[−k2G(̄r, ̄r′)̄Js(̄r′) + (∇′

where
G = G(̄r, ̄r′) = e−jk|̄r−̄r′|
4π |̄r −̄r′|.
(12.21)
Next, we consider the MFIE. We start with (6.111).
̄H𝑖+ ⨍S
̄HsdS′ = 1
2 ̄H,
(12.22)
where
̄Hs = jωεĜn′ × ̄E + (̂n′ × ̄H) × ∇′G + (̂n′ ⋅̄H)∇′G.
However, the boundary conditions on the surface are ̂n′ × ̄E = 0 and ̂n′ ⋅̄H = 0.
Letting ̂n′ × ̄H = ̄Js = surface current, we get the MFIE for the surface current ̄Js.
̂n′ × ̄H𝑖(̄r) + ⨍S
[̂n′ × ̄Js(̄r′) × ∇′G(̄r, ̄r′)]dS′ = 1

̄Js(̄r).
(12.23)
Note that for MFIE, the first term gives the physical optics approximation.
̄Js = 2̂n′ × ̄H𝑖.
(12.24)
Therefore, MFIE should be useful for a large object with a smooth surface whose
radius of curvature is large compared with a wavelength. Then physical optics is a

408
SCATTERING BY COMPLEX OBJECTS
good approximation and the surface integral is a small correction term. On the other
hand, EFIE should be more useful for a thin object such as a wire.
12.4
T-MATRIX METHOD (EXTENDED BOUNDARY
CONDITION METHOD)
Up to this point in this chapter, we have discussed the formulation of the scattering
problem in terms of the surface integral equations for the unknown surface fields. In
this section we present a different technique, originated by P. C. Waterman (1969),
which makes use of the extinction theorem (Sections 6.1 and 6.9). According to the
extinction theorem, the surface field produces a field contribution inside the object
which exactly cancels or extinguishes the incident field throughout the interior of
the object. First, we will show that by using this extinction theorem as the extended
boundary condition, we can get an integral equation for the surface field which holds
throughout the interior of the object. Second, we note that this integral equation
need not be satisfied throughout the interior; it need hold only in any portion of the
interior volume because of the analytic continuity. These two are the key elements
of the T-matrix method. In actual applications, these two ideas are used to derive the
transition matrix (T-matrix) which relates the scattered wave to the incident wave.
We illustrate this technique and explain its meaning by using Dirichlet’s problem as
an example.
Let us consider an incident wave ψi impinging on an object with surface S where
Dirichlet’s boundary condition holds (Fig. 12.4). This is a two-dimensional problem,
and we first express the incident field ψi in a series of appropriate basis functions.
For a two-dimensional problem, the natural choice is cylindrical harmonics. Then we
write
ψ𝑖(̄r) =

T-MATRIX METHOD (EXTENDED BOUNDARY CONDITION METHOD)
409
Note that the incident field ψi is finite everywhere, including the origin, and therefore
Jn(kr) must be used. For a given incident wave, an is the known coefficient. For
example, for a plane wave ψ𝑖(̄r) = exp(−jk̂𝑖⋅̄r) propagating in the direction ϕi, we
have
̂𝑖= cos ϕ𝑖̂x + sin ϕ𝑖̂y,
̄r = r cos ϕ ̂x + r sin ϕ ̂y,
an = e−jn(ϕ𝑖+π∕2).
(12.26)
Next, we write the scattered wave ψs(̄r) in region I outside the circumscribed
cylinder Sc in the same cylindrical harmonics.
ψs(̄r) =
∞
∑
n=−∞
bnH(2)
n (kr)ejnϕ.
(12.27)
In this region the waves are outgoing, and we used the Hankel function of the second
kind to satisfy the radiation condition.
The transition matrix or the T-matrix [T] is defined by
[b] = [T] [a] ,
(12.28)
where [b] = [bn] and [a] = [an] are the column matrices and [T] is the square
matrix. Here these matrices are truncated and finite for numerical calculations. The
T-matrix is then obtained systematically by use of the extinction theorem, as discussed
below.
To obtain the T-matrix, let us first write the extinction theorem (6.12)
ψ𝑖(̄r) + ⨍S
[
ψ(̄r′)∂G(̄r, ̄r′)
∂n′
−G(̄r, ̄r′)∂ψ(̄r′)
∂n′
]
dS′ = 0
if ̄r is inside S.
(12.29)
This theorem applies to regions II and II′ in Fig. 12.4. However, let us apply this only
to region II inside the inscribed cylinder Si. Then |̄r| < |̄r′|, and therefore Green’s
function G(̄r, ̄r′), can be written for r < r′
G(̄r, ̄r′) = −j

∑

Jn(kr)H(2)
n (kr′)ejn(ϕ−ϕ′).
(12.30)
Now we substitute this and (12.25) into (12.29). We then note that ψi in (12.29)
is a series involving Jn(kr) exp(jn ϕ), and the integral term in (12.29) is also a
series involving Jn(kr) exp(jn ϕ), which appears in G(̄r, ̄r′) of (12.30). Since Jn(kr)

where dS′ = [r′2 + (dr′/d ϕ′)2]1/2dϕ′ is the elementary distance along the surface S,

This equation relates the coefficients an of the incident wave to the surface field
ψ(̄r′) and ∂ψ(̄r′)∕∂n′ and is obtained by applying the extinction theorem to region
II only. Therefore, the surface field obtained from (12.31) when substituted into
the extinction theorem (12.29) should cancel the incident field completely in region
II. However, the left side of the extinction theorem (12.29) is a regular solution
of the wave equations in both II′ and II, and therefore if it is null in II, it should
also be null in II′ by analytic continuation. Thus the surface field determined from
(12.31) should be the true surface field satisfying (12.29) for all interior regions II
and II′.
Next we obtain the scattered field ψs in region I using the following:
ψs(̄r) = ∫S

we obtain

(12.33)
We now have an in (12.31) and bn in (12.33) expressed in terms of the surface field. We
next use the boundary condition and express the surface field in terms of a complete
set of functions. We then eliminate the surface field from the two equations (12.31)
and (12.33) and finally obtain the T-matrix.

[Jn(kr′)ejnϕ′],
(12.35)

complete set. Substituting (12.35) into (12.34), we get
[a] = [Q−][α],
[b] = −[Q+][α],
(12.36)
where [a], [b], and [α] are column matrices and

Finally, we eliminate the surface field [α] from (12.36) and get the T-matrix

[T] = −[Q+][Q−]−1.
(12.37)
Let us next consider Neumann’s problem for which the boundary condition on S
is (∂∕∂n′)ψ(̄r′) = 0. From (12.31) and (12.33) we get an and bn in terms of ψ(̄r′) on

then we get

(12.38)
where αn are the unknown coefficients. Substituting this into (12.31) and (12.33),
we get

For a two-media problem, where the wave numbers and the densities outside the
surface S are k0 and ρ0 and those inside S are k1 and ρ1, we let ψ+ and ψ−denote
the surface field just outside and inside the surface S (Fig. 12.4). The field inside S
satisfies the wave equation with the wave number k1 and is regular, and therefore it
can be expanded in the following cylindrical harmonics:
ψ(̄r) =
∞
∑
n=−∞
βnJn(k1 r)ejnϕ′,
(12.42)
where βn is the unknown coefficient. Using this, we can write the field just inside S
as follows:

The T-matrix method has been used successfully for scattering from a body of com-
plex shapes such as particles with irregular shapes. Since it makes use of the expan-
sion of the field in cylindrical harmonics (spherical harmonics for three-dimensional
objects and Fourier expansion for periodic structures), the matrix may become ill-
conditioned if the axial ratio (ratio of the major to minor axes) is much greater than
about 5 or if the object has corners.
In this section, we illustrated the T-matrix method with a two-dimensional problem
and cylindrical harmonics. The T-matrix method can be equally applicable to three-
dimensional problems using spherical harmonics. For electromagnetic problems,
the complete cylindrical or spherical expansion of the vector field must be used
(Waterman, 1969).

SYMMETRY AND UNITARITY OF THE T-MATRIX AND THE
SCATTERING MATRIX
The T-matrix satisfies a certain symmetric relationship because of the reciprocity
principle. If a delta function source is located at ̄r1(r1, ϕ1) and the scattered field
ψs(̄r2) is observed at ̄r2(r2, ϕ2), and next a delta function source is located at ̄r2 and
the scattered field ψs(̄r1) is observed at ̄r1, then according to reciprocity,
ψs(̄r1) = ψs(̄r2).
(12.45)
For the first case, the incident wave is
ψ𝑖(̄r) = −j
4
∑
n
Jn(kr)H(2)
n (kr1)e+jn(ϕ−ϕ1).
(12.46)
Therefore, we have
an = −j
4H(2)
n (kr1)e−jnϕ1.
(12.47)
The scattered field ψs(̄r2) is then given by
ψs(̄r2) =
∑
n

n (kr2)ejnϕ2
=

∑
m

If we switch ̄r1 and ̄r2, we get
ψs(̄r1) =

) ∑
n
∑
m
TnmH(2)
m (kr2)H(2)
n (kr1)ejnϕ1−jmϕ2.
(12.49)
Now noting that ψs(̄r1) = ψs(̄rs) and letting m = –n′ and n = –m′ in (12.49), and
using H(2)
−n = (−1)nH(2)
n , we get the following:
Tmn = (−1)m+nT−n,−m
(12.50)
This is the symmetry relationship satisfied by the T-matrix.
Let us consider the scattering matrix S. We note first that the incident wave is
regular at the origin and is expressed in a series of regular cylindrical harmonics Jn
exp(jnϕ). If we rewrite the incident wave using the identity
Jn(z) = 1

Also we note that ψs is outgoing.

We can now regroup the wave as consisting of the incoming and the outgoing waves.

2[a] + [b] = [S] 1
2[a].
(12.54)
Since [b] = [T][a], clearly [S] is related to [T].
[U] + 2[T] = [S],
(12.55)
where [U] is a unit matrix.
Next, let us consider the conservation of power for a lossless object. If the object
is lossless, the total incoming power should be equal to the total outgoing power. The
total incoming power is given by
P𝑖= ∫
2π
0
d ϕ ||ψ−
𝑖(̄r)||
2.
(12.56)

If we evaluate this total power using the orthogonality of exp(jnϕ), we get
P𝑖= π

(12.57)
where An = anH(1)

(12.58)
where Bn = bnH(1)
n (kr) and we used the relation |H(1)
n (kr)| = |H(2)
n (kr)|.
We now express (12.57) and (12.58) in matrix form. We let A be the column matrix
[An]. Then Pi = (π/2)A+ A, where A+ is the complex conjugate of the transpose of A,
called the adjoint matrix (see Appendix 8.A). Similarly, (12.58) becomes
P0 = π
2(A + 2TA)+(A + 2TA).
Equating P0 to Pi and writing them in matrix form, we get
A+A = A+S+SA,
(12.59)
where we used (12.55). From (12.59) it is clear that the scattering matrix S is unitary
for a lossless object.
S+S = U.

T-MATRIX SOLUTION FOR SCATTERING FROM PERIODIC
SINUSOIDAL SURFACES
In Section 7.5, we discussed the scattering of waves from periodic surfaces using the
Rayleigh hypothesis. Even though that technique was limited to the case where the
slope is less than 0.448, the solution is simple and has been used extensively for many
problems in gratings and corrugated walls. More rigorous solutions can be obtained
by using the T-matrix method.
Let us consider Dirichlet’s problem for the surface defined by
ζ = −h cos2πx
L .

T-MATRIX SOLUTION FOR SCATTERING FROM PERIODIC SINUSOIDAL SURFACES

The incident wave ψi is given by
ψ𝑖= A0e+jqz−jbz,
(12.62)
where β = k sin θi and q = k cos θi and θi is the angle of incidence. The scattered
field ψs in the region z > h is given by the space harmonics
ψs =

Now we use the extinction theorem (12.29) for the region z < –h and use the periodic

n=−∞

2jqnLe−jqn(z′−z)−jβn(x−x′)
for z < z′.
(12.64)
We also let
ψ𝑖(̄r) =
∑
n

(12.65)
For our problem with (12.62), a0 = A0 and an = 0 for n ≠0. However, we can
formulate the problem for the more general case given by (12.65). We substitute
(12.64) and (12.65) into (12.29) and note that ψ(̄r′) = 0 on the surface. We also
express the surface field (∂∕∂n′)ψ(̄r) by the following orthogonal space harmonics:
∂
∂n′ ψ(̄r′)dS′ =
∑
n
αne−jβnx′ dx′.

Note that
∂
∂n′ dS′ =

dx′,
(12.67)
and therefore we used the expansion (12.66) rather than expanding (∂∕∂n′)ψ(̄r′) in
space harmonics.

418
SCATTERING BY COMPLEX OBJECTS
Substituting (12.66) in (12.29), and letting z′ = ζ = –h cos (2πx/L), we get
[a] = [Q−][α],
(12.68)
where
Q−
mn =

Next we use (12.63) in (12.32) with ψ(̄r′) = 0 on the surface, and the periodic
Green’s function
G(̄r, ̄r′) =
∑
n
1
2jqnLe−jqn(z−z′)−jβn(x−x′)

(12.70)
where
Q+
mn =

J|m−n|(qmh)e−j(π∕2)|m−n|.
Combining (12.68) and (12.70), we get
[b] = [T][a],
[T] = −[Q+][Q−]−1.
(12.71)
The T-matrix solution in (12.71) should be exact and applicable for the periodic
surface given by (12.61) even when the slope is higher than 0.448. In actual numerical
calculations, however, the matrices become ill-conditioned if the slope becomes
too high.

VOLUME INTEGRAL EQUATIONS FOR INHOMOGENEOUS
BODIES: TM CASE
In the preceding sections 12.3 and 12.4, we discussed two techniques of solving the
scattering problem for complex objects: the surface integral equation method and
the T-matrix method. Both methods are applicable to Dirichlet’s, Neumann’s, and
two-media problems. However, these two methods cannot be applied to the problem
of scattering by inhomogeneous dielectric bodies or anisotropic bodies. The volume
integral equations discussed in this section can be applied to these problems. It should
be noted, however, that the surface integral equations and the T-matrix method deal

volume integral equations deal with the “volume” distribution of the unknown field,
which requires larger matrices than the surface field for an object of similar size.
Let us consider a two-dimensional dielectric object (Fig. 12.5). The dielectric
constant ε(x, y) is a function of position. From Maxwell’s equations, we note that the
problem of dielectric material with ε = ε0εr is equivalent to having the equivalent
current source Jeq.
∇× ̄E = −jωμ0 ̄H,
∇× ̄H = jωε ̄E = jωε0 ̄E + ̄Jeq,
Jeq = jωε0(εr −1) ̄E.
(12.72)
The total field ̄E consists of the incident field ̄E𝑖and the field ̄Es produced by the
equivalent current Jeq. Using the Hertz vector ̄π, we get (see Section 12.9 for three-
dimensional objects)
̄E = ̄E𝑖+ ̄Es,

the z axis) with the field components Ez, Hx, and Hy. The total field ̄E consists of the
incident field ̄E𝑖and the scattered field ̄Es produced by ̄Jeq. For the TM wave, the
Hertz vector ̄π and the electric field ̄E have only the z component, and therefore we
get from (12.73)

Ezs(̄r) = −jωμ0 ∫S

The integration over each cell in Cmn can be performed numerically. However,
since each cell may have a different shape, the calculation may become tedious. A
simple approximate method of calculating Cmn was proposed by Richmond. For a
sufficiently small cell, we can replace the cell by a circular cell with the same cross-
sectional area. The radius of the nth equivalent circular cell is an. It is then possible
to obtain a simple analytical expression for Cmn. For m ≠n, we use the following

included. In this section, we discuss the TE case for an inhomogeneous and isotropic
body.
The analysis for the TM case discussed in Section 12.7 can be extended to the
TE case. For the TE case, however, there are couplings between Ex and Ey. Let the
incident wave be
E𝑖= ̂xE𝑖x + ̂yE𝑖y.
(12.87)
The equivalent current ̄Jeq is then given by
̄Jeq = jωε0(εr −1) ̄E
= ̂xJx + ̂yJy.
(12.88)
From (12.73), we get
̄Es = ̂xEsx + ̂yEsy,
Esx =

(12.89)
Now we follow the procedure for the TM case and obtain the integral equations for
Ex and Ey.
Ex(̄r) −Esx(̄r) = E𝑖x(̄r),
Ey(̄r) −Esy(̄r) = E𝑖y(̄r),
(12.90)
where Esx and Esy are given in (12.89) as integrals involving Jx and Jy which are
related to Ex and Ey through (12.88).

Now we divide the cross section into N small cells and then approximate each
cell by a circular cell of radius an with the same cross-sectional area as that of the
original cell. We then assume that the field and the dielectric constant are constant
over each cell. In the nth cell, we let Exn and Eyn denote the electric fields Ex and
Ey, respectively. The relative dielectric constant for the nth cell is εn and the incident
field at the center ̄rn of the nth cell has the components Eixn and Eiyn. We can then
convert (12.90) into the following 2N linear equations:

(Amn Exn + Bmn Eyn) = E𝑖xm,
N
∑

(Cmn Exn + Dmn Eyn) = E𝑖ym.
(12.91)
To calculate these coefficients Amn, Bmn, Cmn, and Dmn, we need to calculate Es at
the mth cell due to the constant current ̄J in the nth cell. First let us examine Exm due
to the current Jxn and Jyn in the nth cell (m ≠n).
Jxn = jωε0(εn −1)Exn,
Jyn = jωε0(εn −1)Eyn.

To obtain Esx and Esy at the nth cell due to Jx and Jy in the same nth cell (m = n),
we note that ρ is the distance between ̄r and ̄r′ inside the same circular cell. Using

h11, h12, h21, and h22 are given in (12.93). For m = n, we have

Bnn = Cnn = 0,
(12.96)
where h0 is as given in (12.94).
The scattered field for a plane incident wave can be obtained by following the
procedure for the TM case. At a distance far from the object, the scattered field has
only a ϕ component, which is produced by the ϕ component of the electric field in
the body.
Eϕ = Ey cos ϕ −Ex sin ϕ.

We therefore get the echo width in units of wavelength.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL DIELECTRIC BODIES
In Sections 12.7 and 12.8, we discussed the scattering by two-dimensional dielectric
objects and formulated the integral equations for the electric field inside the body.
This technique can be generalized to three-dimensional objects. However, careful
attention must be paid to the singularity of Green’s function, which has been studied
extensively (Yaghjian, 1980; van Bladel, 1964; Tai, 1971).
Let us start with (12.72) and (12.73). For three-dimensional objects, these equa-
tions are valid if the observation point ̄r is outside the medium. However, to construct
an integral equation for ̄E(̄r), the observation point ̄r must be inside the medium. At
̄r inside the medium, the total field ̄E(̄r) is given by
̄E(̄r) = ̄E𝑖(̄r) + ̄Es(̄r),
(12.99)
where ̄E𝑖is the incident field and ̄Es is the scattered field. The scattered field ̄Es(̄r)
is produced by the equivalent current Jeq(̄r′) and the point ̄r can coincide with ̄r′. To
investigate the case where ̄r ≠̄r′ and the case where ̄r can coincide with ̄r′, we divide
the volume of the dielectric medium into a small spherical volume Vδ centered at ̄r
and the remaining volume V – Vδ. In the volume V −Vδ, ̄r′ does not coincide with
̄r and therefore we can use (12.73). In the volume Vδ, it has been shown that the
electric field is equal to −̄Jeq∕3jωε0. Thus we write
̄Es(̄r) = (−jωμ0)lim

In the above, we took a small spherical volume for Vδ. The formulations are
also valid if Vδ is cubic (Livesay and Chen, 1974) (see Fig. 12.7). However, if Vδ
has other shapes, the electric field at ̄r is different and depends on the shape. The
electric field due to the volume Vδ with ellipsoidal, right circular cylinder, rectangular
parallelepiped, or pillbox has been calculated (Yaghjian, 1980).

ELECTROMAGNETIC APERTURE INTEGRAL EQUATIONS FOR
A CONDUCTING SCREEN
In the preceding sections 12.7 to 12.9, we discussed scattering by conducting and
dielectric bodies. In this section, we consider scattering and wave transmission
through apertures on conducting screens. An example is electromagnetic penetra-
tion through gaps in and apertures on an enclosure, which affect the performance of
electronic systems inside.
Let us consider a conducting screen S with the aperture A illuminated from the
left. According to the equivalence theorem, this problem can be replaced by a closed

screen with the equivalent magnetic current sources (Fig. 12.8).
̄Jms2 = ̄E × ̂n,
̄Jms1 = ̄E × (−̂n),
(12.104)
where ̄E is the actual field on the aperture.
The magnetic field on the left side of the screen is equal to the incident field ̄H𝑖, the
field reflected from the screen with the aperture closed ̄Hr, and the contributions from
̄Jms1. The contribution from ̄Jms1 in front of the screen is the same as the contribution
from ̄Jms1 and that of its image in the absence of the screen. The image of ̄Jms1 is in
the same direction as ̄Jms1 and ̄Jms1 and its image is equal to 2̄Jms1. Therefore, using
the Franz formula (Section 6.9) or the magnetic Hertz vector in Section 2.9, we get
̄H1(̄r) = ̄H𝑖(̄r) + ̄Hr(̄r) + [∇∇⋅+ k2]̄πm1(̄r),
where
̄πm1(̄r) = ∫A

dS′,
G(̄r, ̄r′) = e−jk|̄r−̄r′|

(12.105)
The field on the right side of the screen is similarly given by
̄H2(̄r) = [∇∇⋅+ k2]̄πm2,
(12.106)

where
̄πm2(̄r) = ∫A
G(̄r, ̄r′)2̄jms2
jωμ dS′.
Now the boundary condition on the aperture is the continuity of the tangential electric
field and the tangential magnetic field. The continuity of the tangential electric field
was used in (12.104). The continuity of the magnetic field is
̂n × ̄H1 = ̂n × ̄H2
on A.
(12.107)
Substituting (12.105) and (12.106) into (12.107), we get the desired surface integral
equation for ̄jms1.
̂n × [(∇∇⋅+ k2)̄πm(̄r) + ̄H𝑖(̄r)] = 0

and ̂n × [ ̄H𝑖+ ̄Hr] = 2̂n × ̄H𝑖on A. This is the basic integral equation for the unknown
magnetic current ̄Jms1 in the aperture, and in general, it must be solved numerically
using the moment method or other numerical techniques. The magnetic current
̄jms1 = ̄̄E × (−̂n) must also satisfy the edge condition on the rim of the aperture.
On the aperture, the tangential magnetic field and the normal electric field satisfy
the following simple relationships.
1. The tangential magnetic field is identical to the tangential incident field.
̂n × ̄H1 = ̂n × ̄H2 = ̂n × ̄H𝑖
on A.
(12.109)
To derive these, we use (12.108) and (12.109) and write
̂n × ̄H1(̄r) = 2̂n × ̄H𝑖(̄r) −̂n × ̄H𝑖(̄r)
= ̂n × ̄H𝑖(̄r)
on A.
(12.110)
2. The normal component of the electric field is the same as that of the incident
field.
̂n ⋅E1 = ̂n ⋅̄E2 = ̂n ⋅̄E𝑖
on A.
(12.111)

430
SCATTERING BY COMPLEX OBJECTS
To show this, consider the electric field. The electric field ̄E1 on the left side of the
screen is given by
̄E1(̄r) = ̄E𝑖(̄r) + ̄Er(̄r) −jωμ∇× ̄πm1(̄r).
(12.112)
Similarly, the electric field ̄E2 on the right side is
̄E2(̄r) = −jωμ∇× ̄πm2(̄r).
(12.113)
Noting that ̄πm1 = −̄πm2, the normal components of ̄E1 and ̄E2 are given by
̂n ⋅̄E1 = ̂n ⋅( ̄E𝑖+ ̄Er) + ̂n ⋅(−jωμ∇× ̄πm),
̂n ⋅̄E2 = ̂n ⋅(jωμ∇× πm).
(12.114)
The normal components of ̄E must also be continuous on A, and therefore we get
̂n ⋅̄E1 = ̂n ⋅̄E2 = 1
2 ̂n ⋅( ̄E𝑖+ ̄Er).
(12.115)
However, the normal component of ̄E𝑖and ̄Er when the aperture is closed is twice
the normal component of ̄E𝑖, proving (12.111).
12.11
SMALL APERTURES
If the aperture size is small compared with a wavelength, we can express the effects
of the aperture field in terms of the equivalent magnetic and electric dipoles (Butler
et al., 1978). Let us consider the electric field ̄E2 (12.113) at a distance R ≫λ in the
direction of a unit vector ̂o in the region z > 0 (Fig. 12.9). Green’s function G(̄r, ̄r′)
can then be approximated by
G(̄r, ̄r′) =
1
4πR exp(−jkR + jk̄r′ ⋅̂o),
(12.116)
where |̄r −̄r′| ≃R −̄r′ ⋅̂o. Using this in (12.113) and noting that ∇= −jk̂o, we get
̄E2(̄r) = j2ke−jkR
4πR ̂o × ∫A
̄Jms2(̄r′)ejk̄r′⋅̂odS′.
(12.117)
Since the aperture size is much smaller than a wavelength, we expand exp(jkr′ ⋅̂o) in
Taylor’s series and write
̄E2(̄r) =
∞
∑
n=−∞
̄E2n(̄r).

Similarly, noting (12.112) and (12.113), for the region z < 0, the equivalent magnetic
moment ̄pm is given by
̄pm = +̄̄αm ⋅̄Hsc.
(12.122)
Detailed derivations of the results above using the magnetic polarizability for elliptic
apertures are given in Butler et al. (1978).
The next term for n = 1 in (12.118) gives the field due to an equivalent electric
dipole and quadrupole moments.

its image ̄pe (Fig. 12.9). The dipole moment ̄pe is pointed in the z direction and is
proportional to the normal component of the electric field Escz at the aperture when
the aperture is closed.

where αe is called the electric polarizability. The value of αe for a circular aperture

For the region z < 0, the dipole moment ̄pe is given by

Limiting ourselves to the lowest orders of scattering, we can conclude that a small
aperture is equivalent to the magnetic and electric dipoles given in (12.120), (12.122),
(12.124), and (12.126).
In the above, we discussed the small aperture on a plane screen. This can be
generalized to the coupling of electromagnetic waves between waveguides or cavities
through a small aperture from region 1 to region 2. Let ( ̄Es, ̄Hs) be the field in region
1 when the aperture is closed (short circuited), and let Esz be the normal component
of ̄Es at the aperture and ̄Hst be the tangential component of ̄Hs at the aperture
(Fig. 12.10). Then when the aperture is open, the field in region 1 is the sum of
( ̄Es, ̄Hs) and the field produced by ̄pe and ̄pm placed on the closed aperture in region
1 (Fig. 12.10).
̄pe = −εαeEsẑz,
̄pm = ̄̄αm ⋅̄Hst.
(12.127)
The field in region 2 is then created by the following ̄pe and ̄pm placed on the closed
aperture in region 2:
̄pe = εαeEsẑz,
̄pm = −̄̄αm ⋅̄Hst.

of the symmetry of these two complementary problems, we expect that the solution
to one can be used to solve the other. This equivalent relationship is called Babinet’s
principle.
Consider the two problems shown in Fig. 12.11. In Fig. 12.11a, the conduct-
ing screen with a slot is illuminated by an electric current ̄J, and ( ̄E1, ̄H1) is the
field diffracted by the slot. Now consider the complementary problem shown in
Fig. 12.11b, where the metallic wire is excited by the source current (ε∕μ)1∕2̄Jmc. The
field scattered by the wire is ( ̄Ecs, ̄Hcs). Then Babinet’s principle states that

(12.129)
The proof of (12.129) can be done in two stages. First, we can consider the
three cases shown in Fig. 12.12. In Fig. 12.12a, we have a source ̄J and a perfectly
conducting screen (electric wall on which the tangential electric field is zero) with a
slot and let the fields behind the screen be ̄E1 and ̄H1 (Fig. 12.12a). Next, we consider
a complementary problem where the screen and the slot are interchanged and the
electric wall is replaced by a magnetic wall (tangential magnetic field is zero). Let
the fields at the same position in this case be ̄E2 and ̄H2 (Fig. 12.12b).

Three cases showing Babinet’s principle (12.130).
Third, consider the fields in the absence of the screen and let the fields at the same
position in this case be ̄ET and ̄HT (Fig. 12.12c). Then Babinet’s principle states that
̄E1 + ̄E2 = ̄ET,
̄H1 + ̄H2 = ̄HT.
(12.130)
To prove this, we note from (12.109) that the tangential magnetic field on the slot
in Fig. 12.12a is equal to the tangential magnetic field of the incident field. The
tangential electric field E1 is zero on S1. Thus for Fig. 12.12a, the total tangential
electric and magnetic fields (E1, H1) are
E1 = ET = 0
on screen (S1),
H1 = HT
on slot (S2).
(12.131)

436
SCATTERING BY COMPLEX OBJECTS
For the magnetic screen of Fig. 12.12b,
E2 = ET
on aperture (S1),
H2 = HT = 0
on magnetic wall (S2).
(12.132)
Adding the above two fields, we get
E1 + E2 = ET
on S1,
H1 + H2 = HT
on S2.
(12.133)
We now note that from the uniqueness theorem, E1 on S1 and H1 on S2 uniquely
determine all fields everywhere. Similarly, E2 on S1 and H2 on S2 uniquely determine
all fields everywhere. But the superposition of (E1, H1) and (E2, H2) gives the
field ET on S1 and HT on S2, which by the uniqueness theorem should for z > 0
give fields everywhere identical to the incident field. Thus this proves Babinet’s
principle (12.130).
In the above, we stated Babinet’s principle using a conducting screen with an
aperture and a disk with a magnetic wall. More practical and useful is Babinet’s
principle applied to a slot on a conducting screen and a wire. This can be obtained by
noting the duality of Maxwell’s equations and their invariance when all the quantities
are replaced by the following with the subscript c.

Using Babinet’s principle, we can show the relationship between the impedance
of a slot antenna and the impedance of its complementary wire antenna. Consider the

This important relationship is called Booker’s relation and it shows that if the slot
impedance (or wire antenna impedance) is known, the wire antenna impedance (or
slot impedance) can be found from (12.140).
Mushiake pointed out that as a consequence of Booker’s relation, if the slot and
the wire have the same shape (Fig. 12.15), the antenna is self-complementary, and
the impedance is invariant and equal to η/2 independent of the shape of the antenna

The results above can be used to find the diffraction by ribbons using Babinet’s

RELATED PROBLEMS
Transient phenomena can be treated in the frequency domain and then their Fourier
transform yields the time-domain solution. Alternatively, the transient can be inves-
tigated in the time domain using time stepping (Felsen, 1976). The finite-difference
time-domain method (FDTD) is a useful numerical technique in a time-domain
approach (Yee, 1966). Time-domain solutions can be expressed in a series of com-
plex exponentials that correspond to the singularities in the Laplace transform. This
was proposed by Baum in 1971 and is called the singularity expansion method (SEM)
(see Baum, 1976; Tesche, 1973; Felsen, 1976; Uslenghi, 1978).
There are other numerical techniques to deal with scattering by complex bodies.
Yasuura’s method (Ikuno and Yasuura, 1978; Yasuura and Okuno, 1982), intro-
duced in late 1960s, makes use of the smoothing process on the mode-matching
method. This is shown to be a powerful numerical technique with high accuracy and
efficiency.

CHAPTER 13
GEOMETRIC THEORY OF
DIFFRACTION AND LOW-
FREQUENCY TECHNIQUES
In Chapter 12, we discussed the integral equation method for dealing with scatter-
ing and diffraction from objects. It should be noted that even though the integral
equation itself is exact, the actual solution usually requires extensive numerical and
matrix calculations, such as the moment method and the T-matrix method. It is clear,
then, that the size of the matrix depends on the size of the object. In fact, in many
applications, approximately 10 points per wavelength may often be needed to keep
the error within a few percent; therefore, the exact integral equation method becomes
impractical for a large object. On the other hand, if the object size is much smaller
than a wavelength, the solution should approach a static case. In this chapter, we
examine the high-frequency technique, which is applicable to objects much greater
than a wavelength, and the low-frequency technique, which is applicable to object
sizes much smaller than a wavelength. For object size close to a wavelength, called
the resonance region, the method of moment and other numerical techniques can be
used effectively.
Extensive literature is available for the geometric theory of diffraction (GTD) and
its related subjects. Important papers on GTD have been collected in the IEEE Press
Reprint Series (Hansen, 1981). It is also discussed extensively in recent books by
James (1976) and Jull (1981). Uniform geometric theory of diffraction (UTD) is
covered in Kouyoumjian and Pathak (1974), and uniform asymptotic theory of edge
diffraction (UAT) is discussed in Deschamps et al. (1984) and Lee (1977).

GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION AND LOW-FREQUENCY TECHNIQUES
13.1
GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION
As the wavelength λ approaches zero, the field can be described by geometric optics,
but it contains no diffraction effect. An important extension of geometric optics to
include diffraction was proposed by J. Keller and it is called the geometric theory
of diffraction or GTD (Keller, 1962). It introduces diffracted rays in addition to the
usual geometric optical rays. Unlike geometric optics, the diffracted rays can enter
the shadow regions. The GTD deals with the diffracted ray originating from edges,
corners (vertices), and curved surfaces and is based on the following postulates:
1. Fermat’s principle can be generalized and is applicable to diffracted rays, and
thus the diffracted ray follows a curve that has a stationary optical path among
all the paths between two points.
2. Diffraction is a local phenomenon at high frequencies, and thus the magnitude
of the diffracted ray depends on the nature of the incident wave and on the
boundary in the neighborhood of the point of diffraction.
3. The phase of the diffracted ray is proportional to the optical length of the ray,
and the amplitude varies to conserve the power in a narrow tube of rays.
According to the postulates above, the diffracted rays are proportional to the
product of the incident wave and the diffraction coefficient, in analogy to the geometric
optical rays reflected from the surface, where the reflected ray is proportional to the
incident wave and the reflection coefficient. In general, the diffraction coefficient is
proportional to λ1/2 for edges, to λ for vertices, and decreases exponentially with λ−1
for surfaces. Therefore, the edge diffraction is the strongest, the corner diffraction
is weaker, and the surface diffraction is the weakest. The diffraction coefficient is
obtained by considering the asymptotic form of the exact solutions of the simpler
canonical problem. For example, the edge diffraction coefficient is determined by
the asymptotic form of the exact solution for an infinite wedge.
Let us illustrate the edge diffraction by considering a two-dimensional perfectly
conducting knife edge (Fig. 13.1). We first consider the TM case (Ez, Hx, Hy).

GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION

The magnetic field is transverse to the z axis. The field component Ez satisfies
the wave equation and Dirichlet’s boundary condition (soft surface) (Ez = 0) on the
conductor (x > 0, y = 0). This is equivalent to a scalar problem for the scalar field
ψ = Ez satisfying the wave equation and Dirichlet’s condition ψ = 0 on the surface.
Let Ai be the incident wave ψi at the edge. Then according to the GTD, the
diffracted ray ψd at (s, θs) is given by
ψd(s, θs) = A𝑖D (θs, θ𝑖)e−jks
√
s
,
(13.1)
where D(θs, θi) is the diffraction coefficient, and exp(–jks)/s1/2 represents the cylin-
drical wave.
The determination of the diffraction coefficient D(θs, θi) in (13.1) will be made by
considering a canonical problem of plane-wave diffraction by a knife edge. Since the
exact solution of the knife-edge diffraction is well known, the diffraction coefficient
is obtained by comparing the asymptotic form of the exact solution with (13.1).
Let us consider a plane incident wave given by
ψ𝑖= A𝑖ejks cos(θs−θ𝑖).
(13.2)
The exact solution to this knife-edge problem has already been discussed (Section
11.13). The exact total field at (s, θs) is given by
ψ(s, θs) = A𝑖ej(π∕4)
√
π
[ejks cos(θs−θ𝑖)F(a1) −ejks cos(θs+θ𝑖)F(a2)] ,
(13.3)
where
F(a) = ∫

a1 = −(2ks)1∕2 cos θs −θ𝑖
2
,
a2 = −(2ks)1∕2 cos θs + θ𝑖
2
.
The diffraction coefficient D in (13.1) is then determined by examining the exact
field (13.3) for a large distance s from the edge and comparing this asymptotic form
with (13.1).
Let us first examine the total field ψ at a large distance from the edge in each of
the regions I, II, and III in Fig. 13.1. In region I, we should have
ψ = ψ𝑖+ ψr + ψd,
ψr = −A𝑖ejks cos(θs+θ𝑖),
(13.4)

446
GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION AND LOW-FREQUENCY TECHNIQUES
where ψi is the incident field given in (13.2), ψr is the reflected field, and ψd is the
diffracted field given in (13.1).
In region II, we do not have the reflected wave, and thus
ψ = ψ𝑖+ ψd.
(13.5)
In region III, there is no incident or reflected wave, and thus
ψ = ψd.
(13.6)
Note that these asymptotic forms show discontinuous behavior at the boundaries
between regions I, II, and III, although the exact field is continuous. Since (13.3) is
the exact solution, it should reduce to (13.4), (13.5), and (13.6) for large kr. This
can be shown by first noting that the Fresnel integral has different asymptotic forms;
depending on the sign of a. If a > 0, we have
F(a) ≈e−ja2
j2a ,
a >
√
10.
(13.7)
However, if a < 0, we use the following identity:
F(a) + F(−a) =
√
πe−j(π∕4),
(13.8)
and get
F(a) = e−ja2
j2a +
√
πe−j(π∕4),
a < 0
and
|a| >

(13.9)
The additional constant
√
πe−j(π∕4) will be shown to correspond to the discontinuous
behavior of the asymptotic forms (13.4), (13.5), and (13.6).
Now let us examine (13.3) in region I. Here we get a1 < 0 and a2 < 0, and thus
using (13.9), we get
ψ = ψ𝑖+ ψr + ψd,
(13.10)
ψd = A𝑖D (θs, θ𝑖)e−jks

.
In region II, we get a1 < 0 and a2 > 0, and therefore we have
ψ = ψ𝑖+ ψd.
(13.12)
www.ebook3000.com

DIFFRACTION BY A SLIT FOR DIRICHLET’S PROBLEM
447
In region III, a1 > 0 and a2 > 0, and therefore
ψ = ψd,
(13.13)
where ψd in the above is given in (13.11). We conclude, therefore, that the asymptotic
form of the diffracted field is given by (13.11) for plane-wave incidence.
We now generalize this to state that the diffracted ray from an edge is also given
by (13.11) when an arbitrary incident field at the edge is given by Ai. Making use of
this generalization, we are now in a position to construct a GTD solution for more
complex problems. It should be noted, however, that the diffraction coefficient given
in (13.11) becomes infinite at the reflection boundary between regions I and II where
θs + θi = π, and at the shadow boundary between regions II and III where θs – θi =
π. This is to be expected because a1 or a2 becomes zero at these boundaries and
the asymptotic forms (13.7) and (13.9) cannot be valid in the transition region near
these boundaries. The failure of GTD in the transition regions can be overcome by
the UTD or the UAT. These techniques will be discussed later.
For the TE case (Hz, Ex, Ey), the field component Hz satisfies the wave equation
and Neumann’s boundary condition on the conductor (x > 0, y = 0). In this case we
use Hz in place of Ez. Then the exact solution is also given by (13.3) except that
the minus sign for the second term is replaced by a plus sign. Therefore, we can
summarize both the TM and TE cases as follows. Let ψ be Ez for TM and Hz for
TE. Then if the incident wave ψi at the edge is denoted by Ai, the two-dimensional
diffracted field at (s, θs) in the GTD approximation is given by
ψd(s, θs) = A𝑖D (θs, θ𝑖)e−jks
√
s
,
(13.14)
where D is the diffraction coefficient given by

2(2πk)1∕2
{
1
cos[(θs −θ𝑖)∕2] ∓
1
cos[(θs + θ𝑖)∕2]
}
.
(13.15)
The upper sign should be used for the TM (Dirichlet’s) problem and the lower sign
should be used for the TE (Neumann’s) problem. Whenever convenient, we use Ds
for Dirichlet’s problem (soft screen) and Dh for Neumann’s problem (hard screen).
Note also that (13.14) is valid only in the region |a1| >
√
10 and |a2| >
√
10. If
|a1| <
√
10 or |a2| <
√
10, UTD (Section 13.4) or other high-frequency techniques
(Section 13.9) should be used.

DIFFRACTION BY A SLIT FOR DIRICHLET’S PROBLEM
Let us consider the two-dimensional problem of finding the field diffracted by a

(TM) problem, where ψ = Ez. We now obtain the GTD solution according to the
formulation in Section 13.1. At the observation point P, the field diffracted once at
the edge (x = a, y = 0) is given by
ψs1 = A1 D (θ1, θ0)e−jkr1
√r1
,
(13.16)
where D(θ1, θ0) is as given in (13.15).
Letting D (r1, θ1, θ0) = D (θ1, θ0)e−jkr1 ∕√r1, we get the single diffraction
(Fig. 13.3 ray a)
ψs1 = A1 D(r1, θ1, θ0),
(13.17)
where A1 is the incident field at the edge.
If the incident wave ψi is a plane wave given by
ψ𝑖= A0ejk(x cos θ0+y sin θ0),
(13.18)
then A1 is given by
A1 = A0ejka cos θ0.
(13.19)
Similarly, the single diffraction by the edge at (x = –a, y = 0) is given by (Fig. 13.3
ray c)
ψs2 = A2 D(r2, θ2, π + θ0),

where A2 is the incident wave at the edge, and for a plane incident wave (13.18), it is
given by
A2 = A0e−jka cos θ0
(13.21)
Let us next consider the double diffraction shown in Fig. 13.3 ray b and ray d.
ψd1 = A1 D (2a, π, θ0)D (r2, θ2, π),
ψd2 = A2 D (2a, π, π + θ0)D (r1, θ1, π).
(13.22)
The single and double diffraction terms are dominant and usually give good accuracy
for ka > 1.5. Triple and multiple diffractions can also be included. We can add to ψs1
the ray which traveled from the edge at x = a to the edge at x = –a and back to the
edge at x = a and then diffracted to P. This triply diffracted field is given by
ψt1 = A1 D(2a, π, θ0)D(2a, π, π)D(r1, θ1, π).
(13.23)

450
GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION AND LOW-FREQUENCY TECHNIQUES
The ray that traveled from x = a to x = –an times and then diffracted to P is given by
[D(2a, π, π)]2nψt1.
Therefore, adding all these multiple diffracted rays shown in Fig. 13.3 ray a, we get
ψt1
∞
∑
n=0
[D (2a, π, π)]2n = ψt1[1 −D (2a, π, π)2]−1.
(13.24)
For the ray b, we get
ψd1
∞
∑
n=0
[D (2a, π, π)]2n = ψd1[1 −D (2a, π, π)2]−1,
(13.25)
where ψd1 = A1D(2a, π, θ0)D(r2, θ2, π). Similarly, we get all the rays for c and d in
Fig. 13.3. The complete diffracted field ψd is therefore given by
ψd = ψs1 + ψs2 + (ψd1 + ψd2 + ψt1 + ψt2)[1 −D(2a, π, π)2]−1,
(13.26)
where ψs1 and ψs2 are given in (13.17) and (13.20), ψd1 and ψd2 are given in (13.22),
ψt1 is given in (13.23), and
ψt2 = A2 D(2a, π, π + θ0)D(2a, π, π)D(r2, θ2, π)
Let us examine the diffracted field ψd in (13.26) at a large distance (kr ≫1) from
the slit when the wave is normally incident on the slit. We then get (Fig. 13.2)
r1 = r −a sin θ,
r2 = r + sin θ,

(13.28)
where fd(θ) is the scattering amplitude. We now examine the single and double

Note that θ = 0 is the boundary between the illuminated and shadow regions for each

(13.30)
For a wide slit, the multiple diffractions ψd1, ψd2, ψt1, and ψt2 can be neglected
and (13.30) gives a good approximation. This can be shown to be consistent with the
Kirchhoff diffraction theory for large ka (Section 6.3).
The scattering amplitudes of the single diffraction terms fs1 and fs2 are proportional
to k−1, as seen in (13.30). The scattering amplitudes of the double diffraction terms are
fd1 and fd2, and they are proportional to k−3/2. The terms ft1 and ft2 are proportional to
k−2, and the multiple diffraction terms [1 – D(2a, π, π)2]−1 give all the higher negative
powers of k. These terms can be obtained easily from the general formulations (13.26)
with (13.27). For example, the scattering amplitudes in the forward direction θ = 0
are given by

The transmission cross section σ of an aperture on a screen is defined as the ratio
of the total power transmitted through the aperture to the incident power flux density
when a plane wave is incident. According to the forward scattering theorem, the

where fd is as defined in (13.28) and σ is defined by the total transmitted power per
unit power flux density per unit slit length. If we consider only the single diffractions
fs1 and fs2, we get
σ
2a = 1.
(13.33)
The transmission cross section is equal to the geometric cross section σg = 2a.
If we include the double diffraction terms fd1 and fd2, we get

This gives good agreement with the exact solution for ka greater than about 2 and
fairly good agreement even for ka > 1.

DIFFRACTION BY A SLIT FOR NEUMANN’S PROBLEM AND
SLOPE DIFFRACTION
The two-dimensional diffraction coefficient for a knife edge with Neumann’s condi-
tion is given in (13.15) with ψ = Hz. The single diffraction ψs1 and ψs2 is given by
ψs1 = A1 D (r1, θ1, θ0),
ψs2 = A2 D (r2, θ2, π + θ0),
(13.35)
where

Next consider the double refraction
ψd1 = A1D(2a, π, θ0)D(r2, θ2, π).
(13.36)
For Dirichlet’s problem, this was finite and nonzero. However, for Neumann’s prob-
lem, as seen in (13.15), D (θs, θi) = 0 if either θs = π or θi = π (Fig. 13.4). Therefore,
the wave incident on the edge is proportional to D (2a, π, θ0) and is zero. Since the
diffracted field is obviously not zero, this means that we need to consider the higher-
order term (Keller, 1962; Jull, 1981). The incident field Hz is zero at the edge, but its
derivative, which is proportional to Ex, is not zero and contributes to the higher-order

Note that the double diffraction term is proportional to (ka)−5/2 for Neumann’s
problem, whereas it is (ka)−3/2 for Dirichlet’s problem, as shown in (13.34); therefore,
the double diffraction is weaker for Neumann’s problem than for Dirichlet’s problem.
The expression (13.44) can be used for ka > 1.5 without much error.

UNIFORM GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION FOR AN EDGE

13.4
UNIFORM GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION
FOR AN EDGE
We have already noted in Section 13.1 that the diffraction coefficients Ds and Dh
in (13.15) become singular at θi ± θs = π and therefore cannot be used in the
transition regions where |a1| <
√
10 or |a2| <
√
10 and a1 and a2 are given in (13.3).
Kouyoumjian (1974) and others extended the GTD so that the diffraction coefficients
remain valid in the transition regions. We will illustrate this technique called UTD
using the two-dimensional knife-edge problems discussed in Section 13.1 (Fig. 13.5).
Consider a line source located at (ρ, θi) and the observation point at (s, θs). The
total field is given by (Fig. 13.5)
ψ = ψ𝑖+ ψr + ψd
in region I,
ψ = ψ𝑖+ ψd
in region II,
ψ = ψd
in region III,
(13.45)
where ψi, ψr, and ψd are the incident, reflected, and diffracted fields, respectively. If
we use the GTD solution (13.14) for ψd, it becomes singular in the transition region.
We can, however, use the Fresnel integral representation (13.3). This is continuous
across the transition region, but it is the solution to a plane-wave incidence, not a
cylindrical-wave incidence from a line source. The exact solution for a half-plane
excited by a line source is available, but it is not in a closed form with known functions.
We can, however, modify (13.3) for a line source located far from the edge (kρ ≫1).
The approximate edge-diffracted field excited by a line source according to UTD
(Kouyoumjian and Pathak, 1974) is then given by

The UTD diffraction coefficient D(θs, θi) is given by
D(θs, θ𝑖) = D(θs −θ𝑖) ∓D(θs + θ𝑖),
(13.47)
where the upper sign is for a soft (Dirichlet) surface and the lower sign is for a hard

Now noting that
√
X∕cos(β∕2) = ±(2kL)1∕2, depending on the sign of cos(β/2), we
can rewrite (13.48) as follows:
D (β) = ej(π∕4)(L∕π)1∕2 ejX F(

(13.49)
where
sgn(β −π) =

if β −π > 0,
−1
if β −π < 0.
The function D(β) is therefore discontinuous across β = π, which is the transition
region. This discontinuity exactly cancels the discontinuity of ψi and ψr and yields
the continuous total field everywhere.
To show this, consider the transition region between regions I and II where
θs + θi = π. In this case, noting that F(0) = (
√
π)∕2e−j(π∕4), we get, as θs approaches
π – θi,

pictorial explanation. Summarizing this section, the total field is given by (13.45)–
(13.47), and (13.49). We now have two choices. The ordinary GTD discussed in
Sections 13.1–13.3 is simple and useful outside the transition regions. The UTD
discussed in this section makes use of Fresnel integrals and therefore requires more
numerical work than the GTD. However, it can be used in all regions and gives
continuous and useful results even in the transition regions.
13.5
EDGE DIFFRACTION FOR A POINT SOURCE
Up to this point, we have considered only two-dimensional problems of a knife edge
excited by a plane wave or a line source. If a knife edge is illuminated by a point
source, we need to take into account the angle of incidence (Fig. 13.7). According
to Fermat’s principle, the diffracted rays should be along the optical length, which

is stationary among all paths from the source to the observation point. From this,
we conclude that the incident ray and the diffracted rays make equal angles with the
edge. This angle is denoted by β0 in Fig. 13.7.
Now we write the GTD solution for the diffracted field due to a point source. The
scalar diffracted field ψ0 at the observation point is given by
ψd = A𝑖D(θs, θ𝑖)
[

(13.53)
where Ai = A0e−jkρ/ρ is the incident wave at the edge.
The divergence factor [ρ/s(s + ρ)]1/2 is obtained by observing the conservation of
power in a tube of geometric optical rays. In Fig. 13.8, the total power through the
small cross-sectional area dA is conserved.
|||ψ2

||| dA = |ψ0|2 dA0.
(13.54)
Note the ratio of the cross-sectional area is

(13.55)
Therefore, we get
|ψd|2 =
ρρ′
(ρ + s)(ρ′ + s)|ψ0|2.
(13.56)
As ρ′ →0, |ψ0| becomes infinite, but ρ′|ψ0|2 is finite. Therefore, we conclude that
ψd is proportional to [ρ/s(ρ + s)]1/2 as ρ′ →0.
The diffraction coefficient D(θs, θi) for the region not close to the transition region
can be obtained by examining the exact solution for the field when a plane wave is
obliquely incident on the edge. Let the incident field be (Fig. 13.9)
ψ𝑖= A𝑖exp[jkr sin β0 cos(θ −θ𝑖) + jkz cos β0].

Up to this point, we have discussed GTD and UTD for a knife edge. We now consider
GTD and UTD for a wedge with the angle (2 – n)π (Fig. 13.11). Exact solutions
for a wedge illuminated by a point source, a line source, and a plane wave are
available in the form of infinite series and Fourier integrals. However, they are not in
a convenient closed form. For the field point far from the wedge, the exact solution
can be evaluated to give an asymptotic closed-form expression. In this section, we
summarize the results for GTD and UTD.

SLOPE DIFFRACTION AND GRAZING INCIDENCE
We have discussed in Section 13.3 that if the incident wave is zero at the edge, we
need to include the derivative of the incident wave. In general, if the incident wave
is not slowly varying, the derivative or higher-order terms need to be included. We
therefore write for a soft surface

where

and Ds(θs, θi) is given in (13.67). For example, if the wave is incident on a soft wedge
at the grazing angle, θi = 0, the incident wave consists of the direct wave and the
reflected wave. They are canceled on the surface and therefore the incident wave is
zero. In this case, the slope term is dominant and is given by

Here the factor of 1

CURVED WEDGE
If the wedge has a curved edge with a radius of curvature a, the divergence factor
[ρ/s(s + ρ)]1/2 must be modified to include the effects of the radius of curvature. The
diffracted ray should appear as originating at a distance ρ′ rather than ρ. To derive ρ′,
first consider the case when the incident and diffracted rays are in the plane formed
by the edge and the normal ̂n (or the radius of curvature) (Fig. 13.12). We can then
easily see that
Δθ = Δθ1 + 2Δθ2.

The divergence factor should then be given by
[

(13.74)
ρ′ is therefore the distance between the edge and the caustic (focal point) of the
diffracted ray.
For example, if a plane wave is normally incident on a circular aperture of radius
a, ρ →∞, β0 = π∕2, ̂n ⋅̂ρ = 0, and therefore (Fig. 13.13)

The diffraction coefficients for the curved wedge are the same as those for the straight

OTHER HIGH-FREQUENCY TECHNIQUES
We have discussed the GTD developed by Keller and the UTD developed by Kouy-
oumjian and Pathak. In addition to UTD, the UAT has been developed by Lewis,
Boersma, Ahluwalia, Lee, and Deschamps (Lee, 1977, 1978). In this section, we
outline some basic ideas of UAT, but we will omit the detailed description.
We start with Keller’s GTD and write it as
ψ(Keller) = ψg + ψd,
(13.77)
where ψg is the geometric optical solution and ψd is Keller’s diffracted field. As
we discussed in Sections 13.1 and 13.4, ψd is singular at the shadow and reflection
boundaries. The UTD can be written as
ψ(UTD) = ψg + ψ(K −P),
(13.78)
where ψ(K −P) is the diffracted field developed by Kouyoumjian and Pathak and is
continuous in all regions. The UAT can be written as
ψ(UAT) = ψ(A) + ψd,
(13.79)
where ψd is Keller’s GTD diffracted field and ψ(A) is the new asymptotic term.
ψ(UAT) is then continuous in all regions, and it may also be applicable in the near
field of the edge, although its mathematical expressions may be somewhat complex.
Ufimtsev (1975) developed a technique called the physical theory of diffraction
(PTD) in 1962. This is an extension of physical optics to include the field produced
by the fringe current. For a perfectly conducting body, the PTD can be written as
ψ(PTD) = ψ(PO) + ψ(fringe),
(13.80)

466
GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION AND LOW-FREQUENCY TECHNIQUES
where ψ(PO) is the physical optics field produced by the current 2̂n × ̄H𝑖( ̄H𝑖is the
incident magnetic field and ̂n is the unit vector normal to the surface) and ψ(fringe) is
the fringe field produced by the fringe current. Far from the edge, ψ(PO) approaches
ψg and ψ(fringe) approaches ψd (Knott and Senior, 1974).

ψd = ψ𝑖D
[
ρ
s (s + ρ)
]1∕2
e−jks,
(13.81)
where ψi is the incident field at the edge, D the diffraction coefficient, [ρ/s(s + ρ)]1/2
the divergence factor, s the distance from the edge to the observation point, and ρ the
distance between the edge and the caustic of the diffracted ray [see (13.53)].
For the diffracted wave from a vertex, we should have a spherical wave,
ψd = ψ𝑖De−jks
s
.
(13.82)
The diffraction coefficient D can be determined from the study of the appropriate
canonical problems, such as the corner of an edge or the corner of a cube. Some
studies have been done on this difficult problem (Bowman et al., 1969).
The GTD diffraction field for a smooth convex surface is obtained in the following
manner. Consider the wave originating at P and observed at Q (Fig. 13.14). We
assume that the diffracted ray obeys Fermat’s principle that the total optical path
length between P and Q is minimum. Thus the diffracted ray follows a geodesic path
from P to A and A′ and Q. The wave originating at P is tangentially incident on the
surface at A and is a creeping wave from A to A′ behaving at each point as if it were a
creeping wave on a circular cylinder with the radius equal to the radius of curvature
of the actual surface. The wave then leaves the surface at A′ and propagates to Q. The
diffracted field at Q is therefore given by
ψd = ψ𝑖(A)D

where ψi(A) is the incident field at A; the diffraction coefficient includes the atten-
uation constant α(τ′) of the creeping wave from A to A′[exp(−∫τ
0 α(τ′) dτ′)]. The
radius of curvature ρ3 in (13.83) represents the curvature in the plane perpendicular to
the plane containing the ray P–A–A′–Q. For a detailed discussion on this, see James
(1976, Chapter 6).

LOW-FREQUENCY SCATTERING
Up to this point in this chapter, we have considered the GTD and some of its variations.
These are an improvement over geometric optics. In general, the high-frequency
approximations of the field (ψ, ̄E, and ̄H) may be obtained by expanding the field in
inverse powers of k = ω/c.
̄E =
∞

n=0
̄En

(13.84)
The first term (n = 0) represents geometric optics. In contrast, the low-frequency
approximations are obtained by expanding the field in powers of k = ω/c.
Let us consider the scattered field from a dielectric object whose size is small
compared with a wavelength. We write Maxwell’s equations as where k = ω/c is the
free-space wave number, η0 = μ0/ε0 is the free-space characteristic impedance, and
εr is the relative dielectric constant. We now expand the field in powers of k.
∇× ̄E = (−jk)η0 ̄H,
∇× ̄H = (−jk)

∇⋅(εr ̄E) = 0,

̄H =

(13.86)
Substituting (13.86) into (13.85) and equating the like powers of (–jk), we get the
zeroth-order equations
∇× ̄E0 = 0,
∇× ̄H0 = 0,
∇⋅(εr ̄E0) = 0,
∇⋅̄H0 = 0.
(13.87)

468
GEOMETRIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION AND LOW-FREQUENCY TECHNIQUES
Note that the electric and magnetic fields are not coupled, and they are identical to
the equations for the static case.
The first-order equations are
∇× ̄E1 = η0 ̄H0,
∇× ̄H1 = −εr
η0
̄E0,
∇⋅(εr ̄E1) = 0,
∇⋅̄H1 = 0.
(13.88)
Here ̄E1 and ̄H1 are generated by ̄H0 and ̄E0, respectively.
As an example, consider a plane wave incident on a dielectric ellipsoid. The
incident wave ( ̄E𝑖, ̄H𝑖) is expanded in powers of k.
̄E𝑖=
∞
∑
n=0
(−jk)n ̄En,
̄H𝑖=

∑

(−jk)n ̄Hn.
(13.89)
The zeroth-order solution for ̄E0 is identical to the electrostatic case (Stratton, 1941,
p. 211) and is given in Section 10.6. The zeroth-order solution for ̄H0 is obtained by
(13.87). The incident field is ̄H𝑖= E0∕η0, and these equations are the same as those
in free space and therefore ̄H0 = ̄H𝑖= ̄E0∕η0. Higher-order solutions are given in
van Bladel (1964, p. 279).
Note that for the zeroth-order electric field ̄E0, we used the dielectric constant
εr, which is in general complex. For a lossy medium with conductivity σ, we have
εr = ε′
r −jε′′
r = ε′
r −jσ∕ωε0. If the frequency is low but not zero, we should use the
complex εr rather than separating εr into ε′
r and σ. If dc fields are involved, we should
rewrite Maxwell’s equations as
∇× ̄E = (−jk)η0 ̄H,
∇× ̄H = (−jk)

We can then expand ̄E and ̄H in powers of k and obtain the zeroth-order equations.
∇× ̄E0 = 0,
∇× ̄H0 = σ ̄E0,
∇⋅(σ ̄E0) = 0,
∇⋅̄H0 = 0.
(13.91)
This is the equation for magnetostatics. Solutions for an ellipsoidal conductor are
given by Stratton (1941, p. 207).
Let us next consider the dc current distribution in a conducting body. Since ∇×
̄E0 = 0 from (13.91), we get
̄E0 = −∇V.
(13.92)
Substituting this into the divergence equation in (13.91), we get
∇⋅(σ∇V) = 0.
(13.93)
The current density ̄J is given by
̄J = σ ̄E0 = −σ∇V.
(13.94)
As an example, consider the conducting body shown in Fig. 13.15. At the surface
S1, the voltage V0 is applied and at S2, the voltage is zero. The voltage V then satisfies

(13.93). The boundary condition at the surface S is that the current normal to the
surface is zero. From (13.94), this means that

on S.
The total current I0 is then given by
I0 = ∫S1

CHAPTER 14
PLANAR LAYERS, STRIP LINES,
PATCHES, AND APERTURES
Planar dielectric layers and slabs are found in many applications. Examples are
a dielectric coating on conducting surface, propagation in the atmosphere and the
ocean, strip lines, periodic patches, and apertures embedded in dielectric layers. In
this chapter, we first discuss excitation of waves in planar layers. We then consider
strip lines, patches, and apertures in dielectric layers which are useful in microwave
and millimeter wave applications. See Itoh (1987) for excellent collections of papers
on planar structures, and Unger (1977) for planar waveguides. The spectral domain
method is discussed in Yamashita and Mittra (1968), Itoh (1980), and Scott (1989).
14.1
EXCITATION OF WAVES IN A DIELECTRIC SLAB
Let us consider the excitation of TM waves on a dielectric slab placed on a conducting
plane. This is a two-dimensional problem, and the field components are Ex, Ez, and
Hy. Let us assume that the wave is excited by a small two-dimensional slot shown
in Fig. 14.1. At the slot (x = 0), Ez = E0 is given. Now according to the equivalence
theorem (Section 6.10), the field excited by the aperture field ̄Ea on an aperture in a
conducting surface is the same as the field excited by the following magnetic surface
current density ̄Ks placed on the conducting surface
̄Ks = ̄Ea × ̂n,

where ̂n is the unit vector directed into the observation point (Fig. 14.2). Therefore,
the field is the same as that excited by a magnetic surface current density ̄Ks = E0̂y.
We assume that the slot width W is small compared with a wavelength, and
therefore we can approximate the magnetic source current density ̄Jms by
̄Jms = ̄Ksδ(x) = E0 Wδ(x)δ(z)̂y.
(14.2)
Note that the unit for ̄Jms is volt/m2, and the unit for ̄Ks is volt/m.
Now from Maxwell’s equations,
∇× ̄E = −jωμ ̄H −̄Jms,
∇× ̄H = jωε ̄E,

The solution is then given by a sum of the primary field gp and the secondary field gs.
The primary field is the field that is excited by the source in the infinite homogeneous
space in the absence of any boundaries, and the secondary field represents all the
effects of the boundaries. The primary field may also be called the incident field
and is the particular solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation (14.8). The
secondary field can be called the scattered field and is the complementary solution
of (14.8).
The primary field is easily obtained following Section 5.5.

The physical interpretation of this solution is that exp(–jq1d)/jq1 is twice the direct
primary wave exp(–jq1d)/(2jq1) and represents a sum of the waves from the magnetic
current source and from its image. The images for electric and magnetic current
sources can easily be seen noting that the electric field tangential to the conducting
surface is zero (Fig. 14.3). T is the transmission coefficient from dielectric to air, and
R is the reflection coefficient. If we expand [1 – R exp(–j2q1 d)]−1 in a series, we get

Let us consider the integral in (14.15). We note first that there are poles located at
the roots β = βs of the denominator
1 −R exp(−j2q1d) = 0.
(14.17)
In addition, there are branch points at β = ± k0 due to q0 = (k2

branch point, however, at β = ±k1 even if q1 = (k2
1 −β2)1∕2 appears in the integral.
This is because q1 represents the propagation constant in the x direction within the
slab, and since the slab is bounded at x = 0 and d, changing +q1 to –q2 simply

(14.18)
This is identical to the eigenvalue equation (3.84) for the trapped surface wave.
The integrand in (14.15) therefore contains a finite number of trapped surface
wave poles βp and these are located on the real axis (Fig. 14.5). It is often convenient
to use the transformation from β to α.
β = k0 sin α.

α = αl, which can be found in some structures. If leaky wave poles exist, then as the
observation angle θ increases beyond θl, the leaky wave contribution appears. It is

However, as seen in the above, leaky waves can exist in a part of the space θ > θl.
In the above, the leaky wave appears discontinuously at θ = θl. This is, of course,
not physical, and is caused by our separate evaluation of the saddle-point and the
surface-wave contributions. These two contributions should be evaluated together
to obtain a continuous total field. This is the modified saddle-point technique to be
discussed in Chapter 15.

and f11, f22, and f12 are evaluated at q1s and q2s. Equation (14.32) gives Green’s
function at (x, y, z) when the source is located at (x′, y′, z′) in the medium with the
refractive index n(z). This requires that the saddle points q1s and q2s be found from
(14.31). It is easier, however, to assume q1s and q2s first and then to determine (x, y, z)
for these saddle points, as will be shown shortly. The saddle points give the direction
of the ray at the source point, and the ray equations below can be used to determine
the ray path x = x(z) and y = y(z).

(14.33)
These two equations will be shown to be identical to the ray equation of geometric
optics (Chapter 15). We can also determine the physical meaning of the saddle points
q1s and q2s as follows: Consider the ray for a given q1s and q2s. From (14.33), a small
distance ds along this ray is given by
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2,
(14.34)
where
dx = q1sdz

qs = [k2

If we let

ds = sin θ cos ϕ,
dy
ds = sin θ sin ϕ,
(14.35)
then we get
q1s = k0n(z) sin θ cos ϕ,
q2s = k0n(z) sin θ sin ϕ.
(14.36)
Equation (14.36) shows that for given saddle points q1s and q2s, n(z) sin θ cos ϕ and
n(z) sin θ sin ϕ are constant. Since q2s/q1s = tan ϕ = constant, ϕ is constant along the
ray, and we have n(z) sin θ(z) = constant along the ray. (14.37).
This is identical to Snell’s law. The stationary phase solution is therefore equivalent
to the geometric optics solution.

The procedure for obtaining Green’s function is as follows. Suppose that the ray
is started at (x′, y′, z′) in the direction (θ0, ϕ0). Then q1s and q2s are given by
q1s = k0n(z′) sin θ0 cos ϕ0,
q2s = k0n(z′) sin θ0 sin ϕ0.
(14.38)
These q1s and q2s are used in the ray equation (14.33) to determine (x, y) at z. These
(x, y, z) and q1s and q2s are then used in (14.32) to obtain Green’s function.
As an example, consider the parabolic refractive index profile

(14.39)
The source is located at x′ = 0 and z′ = 0, and the ray is launched in the direction

z = z0 cos θ0 sin

If n(z) = 1, (14.41) reduces to exp(–jkr)/(4πr), as it should.
14.3
STRIP LINES
We now turn to a different topic. Strip lines have many attractive features. They
are compact, inexpensive, and can easily be produced as printed circuits. The most
common types have a strip of conductor on a grounded dielectric slab (Fig. 14.9).
Even though this is a two-conductor line, this structure cannot support TEM modes
because the dielectric occupies only a part of the cross section (see Section 4.9).
Thus, in general, both Ez and Hz are nonzero, and we need to consider hybrid modes
consisting of both TE and TM modes.
Even though the hybrid mode analysis is required for exact analysis of strip lines,
simpler techniques can be used for approximate analysis of strip lines. One useful
method is the quasi-static approximation, in which Ez and Hz are neglected and the
field is assumed to be TEM. The error introduced by this approximation is usually
a fraction of a percent. One drawback of the quasi-static approximation is that since
this is a TEM solution, the propagation constant is independent of frequency (no

modal dispersion) except for the frequency dependence of the dielectric material
itself. In this section, we start with the TEM solution and then discuss the quasi-
TEM approximation and the exact hybrid solution. Important papers on this topic are
compiled by Itoh (1987).
14.3.1
TEM Solution
We have discussed in Section 4.9 that if we have a transmission line consisting of
two conductors and a homogeneous dielectric medium, this line can support a TEM
mode. An example is that of boxed strip lines (Fig. 14.10). As shown in Section 4.9,
TEM modes are given by the following:
̄Et = −(∇tV)e−jkz,
̄Ht = 1
Z ̂z × ̄Et,

where ̄Et and ̄Ht are the electric and magnetic fields transverse to the direction of
wave propagation ̂z and are given by k = ω/v, v = (με)−1/2, and Z = (μ/ε)1/2, which
are the wave number, the velocity of the electromagnetic wave, and the characteristic
impedance of the medium, respectively. The electrostatic potential V(x, y) in (14.12)
satisfies the two-dimensional Laplace equation
(
∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2
)
V(x, y) = 0.
(14.43)
We next define the voltage V0, the current I0, and the characteristic impedance
Z0 of the transmission line. The voltage V0 is the electrostatic potential at one
conductor with respect to the other and is given by the line integral of the electric
field (Fig. 14.11).
V0 = −∫

The current is given by the integral of the surface current density Js around one
conductor,
I0 = ∮
||̄Js|| dl.
(14.45)
The current density ̄Js is related to ̄Ht by ̄Js = ̂n × ̄Ht, where ̂n is the unit vector
normal to the surface of the conductor, and ̄Ht is related to ̄Et. Thus we have
̄Js = ̂n × ̄Ht = 1

where ρs is the surface charge density. The current I0 is therefore related to the total
charge Q,
I0 = ∮v ρsdl = vQ.

The characteristic impedance Zc of the transmission line is then given by

(14.48)
where Ce is the electrostatic capacitance per unit length of the line. It is, therefore,
clear that once the electrostatic capacitance is found, the characteristic impedance is
given by (14.48) and that the solution to the TEM line problem is reduced to finding
the capacitance Ce per unit length of the line.
The capacitance Ce can be expressed using the time-averaged electric stored

If the electrostatic potential V(x, y) is found, the formula above can be used to calculate

(14.54)
It has been shown (Collin, 1966, Chapter 4) that (14.52) and (14.53) are the variational
expressions for the capacitance Ce and that (14.52) gives the upper bound on Ce while
(14.53) gives the lower bound on Ce. Once the solution for V(x, y) or for ρs(x, y) is
obtained, Ce is obtained by either (14.52) or (14.53).
Let us also note that the time-averaged magnetic stored energy Wm is equal to
Wm =

(14.55)

There are several techniques to obtain the solutions for V(x, y) or ρs(x, y) or the
capacitance Ce. Analytical techniques include conformal mapping and the Fourier
transform. The variational technique is also used with numerical techniques and
Fourier transforms.

Quasi-Static Approximation
The TEM solutions discussed above are applicable only to two-conductor lines with
a homogeneous medium. If the medium is inhomogeneous and consists of different

dielectric slabs as shown in Fig. 14.9, the TEM wave cannot exist and both TE
and TM modes are needed. However, the z components of electric and magnetic
fields are often negligibly small, and the characteristics of the transmission line
with an inhomogeneous dielectric medium can be approximated by the quasi-static
approximation to be described below. The error introduced may be less than a fraction
of a percent for most applications.
In the quasi-static approximation, we assume that the transverse electric and
magnetic field distributions are approximately equal to that of the static electric and
magnetic field distributions. The time-averaged electric and magnetic stored energies
are assumed to be
We = Wm = 1
4Ce V2
0 = 1
4LeI2
0.
(14.57)
The characteristic impedance Zc is given approximately by (Le/Ce)1/2. However, since
the inductance Le does not depend on the dielectric material, it is the same as that of
free space. Therefore, we write
Zc = Z0
(C0
Ce
)1∕2
,
(14.58)
where Ce is the actual capacitance per unit length of the line, Z0 = (Le/C0)1/2 is the
characteristic impedance of the transmission line, and C0 is the capacitance per unit
length of the line if the medium is free space. We also approximate the propagation
constant k by
k = ω(Le Ce)1∕2 = k0
(Ce
C0
)1∕2
,
(14.59)
where k0 = 2π/λ0 is the free-space wave number.
Under the quasi-static approximation, we only need to calculate Ce and C0 in
(14.58) and (14.59). To find Ce in an inhomogeneous medium, we first note that ∇t ×
̄E = 0, where ∇t = ̂x(∂∕∂x) + ̂y(∂∕∂y), and ̄E is given by the electrostatic potential V.
̄E = −∇t V.
(14.60)
Substituting this into ∇t ⋅̄D = ∇t ⋅(ε ̄E) = 0, we get ∇t⋅⋅(ε∇tV) = 0, which we write
as

V(x, y) = 0,
(14.61)
where εr(x, y) is the relative dielectric constant of the medium.

STRIP LINES
491
Once (14.61) is solved for V(x, y) satisfying the boundary condition that V =
V1 = constant on one conductor and V = V2 = constant on the other conductor, the
capacitance Ce is obtained by (14.52). We can also use the other variational form
(14.53) if we use
∇t ⋅(ε∇t)G(̄r, ̄r′) = −δ(̄r −̄r′),
(14.62)
in place of (14.54). This is of course the same as solving (14.61) with the delta
function as the source term.
14.3.3
Exact Hybrid Solution
Both the TEM solution and the quasi-static solution depend only on the electrostatic
capacitance and therefore are nondispersive as long as the frequency dependence of
the dielectric constant is negligible. However, these TEM solutions are approximate,
and the exact solutions are not TEM but a combination of TE and TM modes. Only
this exact hybrid solution exhibits the complete dispersion characteristics of a strip
line.
Let us start with the exact formulation of the problem. We need both TM and TE
modes as shown in (4.11) and (4.16). Thus we write the fields in air (i = 1) and in
dielectric (i = 2)
Ez𝑖= kc𝑖ϕ𝑖(x, y)e−jβz,
Hz𝑖= kc𝑖ψ𝑖(x, y)e−jβz,
̄Et𝑖= [−jβ∇tϕ𝑖(x, y) + jωμ𝑖̂z × ∇𝑖ψ𝑖(x, y)]e−jβz,
̄Ht𝑖= [−jωε𝑖̂z × ∇tϕ𝑖(x, y) −jβ∇tψ𝑖(x, y)]e−jβz,
(14.63)
where

) ϕ𝑖= 0,
(∇2

k2
c𝑖= k2
𝑖−β2.
The boundary conditions are that the tangential components of the electric and
magnetic fields are continuous across the air–dielectric boundary, the tangential
electric field is zero on the conductor, and the field satisfies the radiation condition
at infinity. Several methods have been proposed to solve this exact hybrid problem.
The spectral domain approach has been used successfully to solve this problem. We
outline this approach in a later section. A numerical technique such as the finite-
element method has also been used to solve this problem (IEEE Trans. MTT, October
1985).

PERPENDICULAR TO DIELECTRIC LAYERS
In Section 14.1, we considered the two-dimensional problem of wave excitation
in dielectric layers. In this section, we present formulations for a general three-
dimensional problem. Consider the dielectric layers shown in Fig. 14.12. It can be
shown that the vertical electric dipole in the presence of dielectric layers excites
only the TM waves, which are generated by the electric Hertz vector Π′̂z. Also,
the vertical magnetic dipole excites only the TE waves, which are generated by the
magnetic Hertz vector Π′′̂z.
Let us first consider the waves excited by the electric current density Jz(x′, y′, z′)
pointed in the z direction. In layer 1, the electric Hertz vector Π′̂z satisfies the scalar
wave equation

̃Jz(α, β, z) = ∫Jz(x, y, z)ejαx+jβy dx dy.

Now the tangential electric and magnetic fields are given by

̄Ht = jωε(∇tΠ′ × ̂z).
(14.67)
Fourier transforms of ̄Et and ̄Ht are obtained from (14.67) by letting ∇t = −jα̂x −
jβ̂y = −j̄α. We also note that while ̄Ht is proportional to Π′, ̄Et is proportional to
∂Π′/∂z. This means that when a delta function source is located at z′, ̄Et changes its
sign depending on whether z > z′ or z < z′. Thus it is more convenient to express
̄Et by the current, which changes its sign in the same manner. We introduce the
magnetic voltage V′
m, which is proportional to ̄Ht, and the magnetic current I′
m, which
is proportional to ̄Et, and then write the Fourier transforms of ̄Et and ̄Ht as follows:

m and I′
m can be formed by using the equivalent transmission line
shown in Fig. 14.13. Note that at perfectly conducting plane, ̄e = 0 and thus I′

Therefore, the perfectly conducting plane is represented by an open terminal in the
transmission line. Note also that the choice of V′
m and I′
m in (14.68) are made so that
the current injected at the source point is I′
m = 1 when ̄Jz = 1, as shown in Fig. 14.13.
The procedure of finding ̄Et and ̄Ht is as follows: First we solve the transmission-
line problem in Fig. 14.13 with the unit current Im = 1 at the source point z′. Each layer
has the characteristic impedance Z′
m𝑖= ωε𝑖∕γ𝑖(𝑖= 1, 2, …), and the propagation
constant γi. Once we find the voltage and current distribution V′

When converted to a cylindrical system, this is identical to the expression (15.23) for

WAVES EXCITED BY TRANSVERSE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC
CURRENTS IN DIELECTRIC LAYERS
Microstrip lines carry electric currents in the x–y plane embedded in layers.
Frequency-selective surfaces are composed of periodic patches and apertures carry-
ing electric and magnetic currents in the x–y plane in dielectric layers. It is therefore
necessary to formulate the problem for waves excited by the currents ̄Jt and ̄Jmt which
are transverse to the z direction.
First we note that Πx and Πy are simply related to Jx and Jy. However, Πx and Πy
are coupled at the dielectric interface and the formulation will become quite involved.
A simpler technique is to use Π′̂z and Π′′̂z, because there is no coupling between
Π′ and Π′′ at the dielectric interface. This formulation was proposed by Itoh (1980)
and by Felsen and Marcuvitz (1973). Both give the same results. We will follow
Felsen–Marcuvitz formulation. First we note that ̄E and ̄H are given by
̄E = ∇× ∇× (Π′̂z) −jωμ∇× (Π′′̂z),
̄H = jωε∇× (Π′̂z) + ∇× ∇× (Π′′̂z).

the transverse gradient operator on the source ̄r′ coordinate and ∂/∂z′ is the derivative
with respect to z′. The derivation of (14.75) is given by Felsen and Marcuvitz (1973,
p. 445). Now we take Fourier transform of the transverse electric and magnetic
field
̄et = ∫
̄Ete−jαx−jβy dx dy
= ̄̄e ⋅̄J,
̄ht = ∫
̄Htejαx+jβy dx dy
= ̄̄h ⋅̄J,
(14.76)
where ̄J is the Fourier transform of ̄Jt
̄J = ∫
̄Jtejαx+jβy dx dy
and ̄̄e and ̄̄h are Green’s dyadic. Once we find ̄et and ̄ht, we get ̄Et and ̄Ht by taking
the inverse Fourier transform
̄Et =
1
(2π)2 ∫̄ete−jαx−jβy dx dβ,
̄Ht =
1
(2π)2 ∫
̄hte−jαx−jβy dα dβ.
(14.77)
Green’s dyadic [̄̄e] and [̄̄h] can be obtained based on (14.75). We give the final
results for ̄̄e and ̄̄h using the equivalent transmission-line voltages and currents

so that the boundary conditions at dielectric interfaces, that the tangential electric and

In actual calculation, we solve the transmission line in Fig. 14.15 with the unit
current source as shown. We get V′ and I′ if we use the characteristic impedance
Z′, and we get V′′ and I′′ if we use the characteristic impedance Z′′. These are then
substituted in (14.78) to obtain Green’s dyadic [̄̄e] and [̄̄h].

STRIP LINES EMBEDDED IN DIELECTRIC LAYERS
Making use of the formulation given in Section 14.5, we now discuss the method to
calculate the propagation constant of a strip line (Fig. 14.17). At z = 0, the tangential
electric field is zero on the strip. We also note that the unknown in the problem is

β, the propagation constant in the y direction. Thus we only have the integral with
respect to α. We then have
̄Et = 1
2π ∫̄̄e ⋅̄Je−jαx dα = 0
(14.84)
at z = 0 and |x| < w/2.
Now we use the moment method. We express ̄J, the Fourier transform of ̄Jt in a
series of N basis functions ̄Jn and N unknown coefficients Cn.
̄J =
N
∑
n=1
̄Jn Cn,
(14.85)

̄Jn =

̄Cn =

and ̄Jn is the Fourier transform of the basis function ̄Jtn
̄Jn = ∫
̄Jtne+jαx dx.
(14.86)
We then multiply (14.84) from the left by the transpose of ̄Jtm and integrate over the
strip with respect to x. This gives the transpose of the conjugate of ̄Jm, m = 1, 2,…, N.
Thus we get the following N × N matrix equation
[Kmn][Cn] = 0,

In order to have nonzero solution for [Cn], the determinant of [K] must be zero.
|Kmn| = 0.
(14.88)
The solution of (14.88) gives the propagation constant β. The foregoing technique of
using the basis function as the weighting function is called Galerkin’s method.
The basis functions satisfying the edge condition have been proposed (Itoh, 1980).
For example, we can use for n = 1, 2,…, N,
Jtnx =
sin(2n πx∕w)
[1 −(2x∕w)2]1∕2 ,
Jtny = 0,
(14.89)
and for n = N + 1, N + 2,…, 2N,
Jtnx = 0,
Jtny = cos[2(n −1)πx∕w]

PERIODIC PATCHES AND APERTURES EMBEDDED IN
DIELECTRIC LAYERS
Let us consider periodically placed patches and apertures embedded in dielectric
layers. These structures are often used as frequency-selective surfaces. For periodic
structures, we can use all the formulations developed in the preceding sections if we
replace Fourier integrals with space harmonic Floquet representations (see Chapter
7). Specifically, we make the following changes:

α0 = k sin θ0 cos ϕ0,
β0 = k sin θ0 sin ϕ0.
The periods in the x and the y directions are lx and ly, respectively, and (θ0, ϕ0) is the
direction of the incident wave.
For skewed periodic structure (Fig. 14.18), noting that it is periodic in x′ and y′,
we have
y′ sin Ω = y,
x′ + y′ cos Ω = x.
(14.93)
From this, we get y′ = y/sin Ω and x′ = x – y cot Ω. The Floquet modes, which are
periodic in x′ and y′, are given by

(14.94)
Let us consider the current distribution on the patch in the periodic structure. The
total tangential electric field is the sum of the incident and the scattered waves, and
this must be zero on the patch. Therefore, we write
̄Einc + ̄Et = 0
on patch.

̄Jt =
∑

̄Jtj Cj,
̄J =
∑

(14.97)
We substitute (14.97) into (14.96), multiply (14.96) by the transpose of ̄Jt𝑖, and
integrate over the patch as we did in Section 14.6. We then get
[K𝑖j][Cj] + [E𝑖] = 0,

where [J∗

and the incident wave ̄Einc is given by ̄Einc = ̄E0 e−jα0x−jβ0y. The solution of (14.98)
gives the coefficient Cj and the current distribution is given by (14.97).
Next we consider the field of aperture embedded in dielectric layers. On one side
of the aperture, the tangential magnetic field is given by ̄Hinc + ̄H1, where ̄H1 is the

PERIODIC PATCHES AND APERTURES EMBEDDED IN DIELECTRIC LAYERS
505
contribution from the aperture field ̄Ea. On the other side we have the magnetic field
̄H2 contributed by the same aperture field ̄Ea. These two magnetic fields must be
equal at the aperture and therefore we write
̄Hinc + ̄H1 = ̄H2
on aperture.
(14.99)
Making use of the formulations given in (14.81) we express ̄H1 and ̄H2 in terms of
the aperture field ̄Ea.
̄H1 =

lx ly

∑

̄̄hm ⋅̄ea e−jαmx−jβny.
(14.100)
̄H2 is given in the same form except that ̄hm is chosen for the other side of the aperture.
Next, the aperture field ̄Ea and its Fourier transform ̄ea are expressed in series of
basis functions ̄Ej and its Fourier transform ̄ej with unknown coefficients Cj.
̄Ea =
∑
j
̄Ej Cj,
̄ea =
∑

̄ej Cj.
(14.101)
We then take the vector product of the aperture basis functions ̄E𝑖and (14.99), and
integrate over the aperture
∫dx dy ̄E𝑖× ( ̄Hinc + ̄H1) = ∫dx dy ̄E𝑖× ̄H2.
(14.102)
The above is the equivalent of multiplying (14.99) by ̂z × ̄E𝑖and integrating over the
aperture. Thus we obtain the following matrix equation:
[H𝑖] + [L𝑖j][Cj] = [M𝑖j][Cj],

RADIATION FROM A DIPOLE ON THE
CONDUCTING EARTH
15.1
SOMMERFELD DIPOLE PROBLEM
One of the important practical problems in radio is the determination of the char-
acteristics of radio-wave propagation over the earth. The theoretical investigation of
this problem, however, involved some subtle mathematical analyses that attracted
attention from a great number of mathematicians and scientists over the past several
decades. Historically, the problem dates back to the work by Zenneck in 1907, in
which he investigated the characteristics of the wave propagating over the earth’s
surface, now called the Zenneck wave. Sommerfeld in 1909 investigated the excita-
tion of the Zenneck wave by a dipole source. One portion of this solution had all the
characteristics of the Zenneck wave on the surface and thus was called the surface
wave.
The work of Sommerfeld, however, initiated a widely known controversy which
was not completely resolved until the works of Ott, Van der Waerden, and Banos in the
late 1940s. The controversy ranged over the existence of the Zenneck surface wave,
the definition of the surface wave, the choice of the branch cuts, and the poles in right
or wrong Riemann surfaces. In addition, the 1909 paper by Sommerfeld contained
an error in a sign, adding considerable confusion, even though the 1926 paper by
Sommerfeld was correct (see Banos, 1966; Brekhovskikh, 1960; Sommerfeld, 1949;
Wait, 1962, 1981; see also related topics in Bremmer, 1949, and Wait, 1982). In this
chapter, we present a systematic study of this problem, and whenever appropriate,
we indicate the source of the historical controversies.

VERTICAL ELECTRIC DIPOLE LOCATED ABOVE THE EARTH
Let us consider the radiation from a vertical dipole above the earth (Fig. 15.1). The
earth is characterized by the relative dielectric constant εr and the conductivity σ
or, equivalently, the complex relative dielectric constant ε/ε0 or complex index of
refraction n.
n2 = ε
ε0
= εr −j σ
ωε0
.
(15.1)
The dipole is located at z = h in air, where the wave number is k; the wave number
within the earth is ke. In this example k is real and ke is complex, but the formulation
is equally applicable to cases where k is complex (such as in the ionosphere) and ke
is real (air), or both k and ke are complex (ice and water or ground).
Let us first consider the field in air (z > 0). We recognize that the field can be
described by the Hertz vector ̄π, whose rectangular components satisfy a scalar wave
equation,
(∇2 + k2)πz = −Jz
jωε0
,
(15.2)
and the electric dipole with the equivalent length L carrying a current I located at r′
is given by
Jz = ILδ(r −r′).
(15.3)
For convenience, we let
IL
jωε0
= 1,
(15.4)
and thus in air we have
(∇2 + k2)πz = −δ(r −r′).
(15.5)

VERTICAL ELECTRIC DIPOLE LOCATED ABOVE THE EARTH
511
Within the ground (z < 0) we have
(∇2 + k2
e
) πz + 0.
(15.6)
The boundary condition at z = 0 is that both tangential electric and magnetic fields are
continuous across the boundary. Equations (15.5) and (15.6) together with the bound-
ary conditions and the radiation condition give a complete mathematical description
of the problem. We write the solution of (15.5) as a sum of the primary wave and the
secondary wave. The primary wave is the wave radiated from the dipole in an infinite
space in the absence of the boundary and has the correct singularity at the location
of the antenna. The secondary wave represents the effects of the boundary but has no
singularity at the antenna location.
Let us consider the primary wave πp. This is obviously given by
πp = e−jk|r−r′|
4π |r −r′|.
(15.7)
To satisfy the boundary conditions, we need to express (15.7) in terms of cylindrical
waves that have the same radial wave number in air and within the ground. This is
done by the Fourier–Bessel transform shown below.
Let us write (15.5) in a cylindrical coordinate system

}
πp = δ(ρ −ρ′)δ(ϕ −ϕ′)δ(z −z′)
ρ
(15.8)
First, we expand πp in a Fourier series in ϕ. Noting that πp is a function of ϕ – ϕ′, we
write
πp =
∞
∑
m=−∞
πm(ρ, z)e−jm(ϕ−ϕ′),
(15.9)
where
πm(ρ, z) = 1

(15.10)
We now express πm in a Fourier–Bessel transform
πm(ρ, z) = ∫

where
gm(λ, z) = ∫

πm(ρ, z)Jm(λρ)ρ dρ.
Equation (15.11) is the Fourier–Bessel transform, which is the cylindrical equivalent
of the usual Fourier transform. Note that λ is a complex variable commonly used in
Fourier–Bessel transforms and is not a wavelength here.
Applying the Fourier–Bessel transform to both sides of (15.10), we obtain
(
d2
dz2 + k2 −λ2
)
gm(λ, z) = −δ(z −z′)Jm(λρ′)
2π
.
(15.12)
To obtain (15.12) from (15.10), we use integration by parts and note the behaviors of
πm as ρ →0 and ρ →∞. Equation (15.12) is easily solved to give
gm(λ, z) = e−jq|z−z′|
2jq
Jm(λρ′)
2π
,
(15.12a)
where λ2 + q2 = k2.
Substituting (15.12a) into (15.11) and then into (15.9), we obtain

Jm(λρ)Jm(λρ′)e−jq|z−z′| λ dλ

(15.13)
Equation (15.13) is, of course, equal to (15.7), but it is written in terms of the
cylindrical wave with the propagation constant λ (i.e., Jm(λρ)). By expanding the
field above and below the boundary in terms of the same wave number λ, we can
satisfy the boundary conditions at any ρ. In contrast, when the boundary is in parallel
to the z axis, such as in a dielectric cylinder, we use the Fourier transform in the z
direction and express the field inside and outside the cylinder in terms of the same
wave number in the z direction, e–jhz.
In particular, when the antenna is located at ρ′ = 0 and z′ = h, (15.13) becomes

Let us now examine the problem pictured in Fig. 15.1. In air (regions I and II), πz
satisfies the differential equation
(∇2 + k2)πz = −δ(r −r′),
(15.15)
where r′ is at ρ = 0 and z = h. We write πz as a sum of the primary wave πp and the
scattered wave πs
πz = πp + πs.
(15.16)

The difference in exponents (z – h) and (h – z) in (15.17a) and (15.17b) represents
the singularity at z = h. The scattered wave πs has no singularity at z = h and it
satisfies the homogeneous wave equation. Therefore, for both regions I and II, we
write

made so that this represents the outgoing wave in the + z direction satisfying the
“radiation condition” when q is in the fourth quadrant. Similarly, (+jqez) is chosen
for (15.20) to represent the outgoing wave in the –z direction when qe is in the fourth
quadrant. Other commonly used notations are μ or γ in place of jq. We choose jq
because q represents the wave number in the z direction in the same sense that λ is
the wave number in the ρ direction.
Equations (15.16)–(15.18), and (15.20) represent the complete expressions of the
fields, which are expressed in terms of two unknown functions, R(λ) and T(λ). These
two functions are now determined by applying the boundary conditions at z = 0.
The conditions are that the tangential electric and tangential magnetic fields are
continuous across the boundary. Because of the symmetry of the problem, the only
tangential electric field is Eρ, and the only magnetic field is Hϕ. Thus, noting that
Eρ =

Hϕ = −jωε ∂

πp represents the direct wave from the antenna to the observation point, and πs
represents the reflected wave as pictured in Fig. 15.2.
To evaluate the integral, it is convenient to convert the range of the integral from
(0 →+ ∞) to (–∞→+∞). To this end, we use the identity
J0(λρ) = 1

The contour W is shown in Fig. 15.4.
It is not possible to evaluate the integral (15.31) in terms of elementary functions in
a closed form. Thus it is necessary to evaluate the integral by approximate techniques.
The approximate evaluation of the integral (15.31) may be classified into the following
three cases:
1. Radiation field using the saddle-point technique. We may evaluate (15.31) for
a large distance from the image point using the saddle-point technique. This
yields a simple expression for the radiation pattern of the reflected wave.

2. The field along the surface. The evaluation of the field on the earth surface
is the central point of this Sommerfeld problem. This is accomplished by the
saddle-point technique modified by the presence of the pole (Sommerfeld pole).
3. Lateral wave. If the index of refraction n is smaller than unity, the integration
along the branch cut must be considered. This results in the lateral wave.
Mathematically, the three cases above result from the saddle-point evaluation, the
effect of the pole, and the branch point. The consideration of these three points is
most important when evaluating a complex integral of this type. In addition to the
three analytical methods above, we can also carry out the integration numerically. A
significant improvement in efficiency results when the integration path is deformed
into the steepest descent path. This is discussed in Section 15.7.
15.4
RADIATION FIELD: SADDLE-POINT TECHNIQUE
When the observation point is far from the antenna, it is possible to evaluate the
integral in (15.31) and obtain a simple expression for the radiation field. This far-field
solution is not valid for the region close to the surface, where it is necessary to employ
the modified saddle-point technique described in the next section.
Let us evaluate (15.31) by means of the saddle-point technique. We first approxi-
mate the Hankel function by its asymptotic form
H(2)
0 (λρ) =
(
2
πλρ
)1∕2
e−jλρ+j(π∕).
(15.32)
This is valid only for |λρ| ≫1. But λ ranges from –∞to +∞. Note, however, that
the main contribution to the integral comes from the neighborhood of λ = k sin θ
and thus |λρ| ∼kR2 sin2θ. Therefore, (15.32) can be used as long as θ is not too
small (the radiation close to the vertical axis) (see Banos, 1966, p. 76). If θ is small,
the double-saddle-point method should be used. Then the first term of the rigorous
asymptotic solution is identical to that obtained by (15.32). Using (15.32), we get

where λ = k sin θ is substituted in q =

k2 −λ2 and qe =

k2n2 −λ2, and R2 is the
distance from the image point (Fig. 15.5).
Equation (15.35) is the spherical wave originating at the image point, but the
magnitude is multiplied by the reflection coefficient R(θ).
R(θ) = n2 cos θ −
√
n2 −sin2 θ
n2 cos θ +
√
n2 −sin2 θ
.
(15.36)
This reflection coefficient is exactly the same as the plane-wave reflection coefficient
when the incident angle is θ. This is to be expected because the saddle-point technique
is valid for the field far from the source and thus the wave is expected to behave locally
as a plane wave.
The total field is then given by
π = πp + πs
= e−jkR1
4πR1
+ R(θ)e−jkR2
4πR2
.
(15.37)
We note, however, that on the surface of the earth, R1 = R2 = R and at a large
distance, θ approaches π/2, and thus R(θ) approaches –1. Therefore the expression
(15.37) reduces to zero on the surface far from the source. This is to be expected
because far from the source the wave should behave essentially as a spherical wave,
but on the surface the air and the earth have two different wave numbers, k and ke.
Thus it is impossible to have two different spherical waves in air and within the earth
having the same phase relationship to satisfy boundary conditions.

FIELD ALONG THE SURFACE AND THE SINGULARITIES OF THE INTEGRAND
519
In general, a spherical wave of the type e–jkR/R should vanish along the interface
between two different media. This of course does not imply that other wave types, such
as 1/R2, vanish, and in fact, the Sommerfeld problem in Section 15.5 is essentially
that of finding the field on the surface.
15.5
FIELD ALONG THE SURFACE AND THE SINGULARITIES OF THE
INTEGRAND
The evaluation of the field on the surface due to a dipole source is central to the
Sommerfeld problem. This is an important practical problem of radio-wave propaga-
tion. It also presents a rather involved mathematical subtlety; therefore, a thorough
understanding of the basic techniques is very important.
Let us first write the total field as a sum of the field when the earth is perfectly
conducting and the term representing the finiteness of the conductivity of the earth.
π = e−jkR1
4πR1
+ e−jkR2

where the approximation (15.32) has been used in (15.39b).
We can work with this form (15.39b), but as will be shown shortly, this form
contains branch points at λ = ± k and λ = ± ke. It is possible to eliminate the branch
points at λ = ± k by the following transformation of the variable of integration from
λ to α:
λ = k sin α.
(15.40)
Furthermore, using R2 and θ instead of ρ and z through the transformation
ρ = R2 sin θ,
z + h = R2 cos θ,
(15.41)
Eq. (15.39b) becomes

Equations (15.39b) and (15.42) are the basic integrals that must be evaluated. The
actual evaluation in this section is done in the α plane using (15.42) because the
procedure is simpler and clearer in the α plane than in the λ plane. However, the
corresponding discussion in the λ plane is given in Appendix 15.B, to clarify the
situation, particularly with respect to the historical controversies of this Sommerfeld
problem.
In evaluating complex integrals, it is essential first to examine all the singularities
of the integrand. In general, there are three kinds of singularities: poles, essential
singularities, and branch points. The singularities of a function f(λ) are the points
where f(λ) is not analytic.
1. Pole (isolated singularity). In the neighborhood of the pole, f(λ) can be
expanded in a Laurent series with finite negative powers.
2. Essential singularities. f (λ) is expressed in an infinite series of negative powers.
For example, e1∕λ = 1 + 1∕λ + 1∕2!λ2 + ⋯+ 1∕n!λn + ⋯.
3. Branch points. The function f (λ) has more than one value at a given λ, repre-
senting more than one branch. The points where these branches meet are the
branch points. For example, f(λ) = λ1∕2, f(λ) = ln λ.
In our problem there are poles where the denominator of the integrand vanishes,
n2 q + qe = 0
in the λ plane,
(15.43a)
n2 cos a +
√
n2 −sin2 α = 0
in the λ plane,
(15.43b)
and branch points
at λ = ±k
and
λ = ±ke
in the λ plane,
(15.44a)
and
at sin α = ±n in the α plane.
(15.44b)
In addition, there is a branch point at λ = 0 due to the Hankel function H(2)
0 (λρ).
However, since λ represents the propagation constant in the radial direction, the wave
corresponding to this branch point λ = 0 does not propagate on the surface, and thus
this branch point has practically no effect on the field.
The integration in (15.42) will be carried out using the saddle-point technique.
However, the pole in the integrand is located close to the saddle point and thus the
modified saddle-point technique must be used. It is therefore important to determine

SOMMERFELD POLE AND ZENNECK WAVE
521
the location of the pole, particularly with respect to the different branches of the
complex plane resulting from the branch points.
Let us consider the branch points in (15.42). Because of the square root in
√
n2 −sin2 α, there are two Riemann surfaces. We draw the branch cut in the α
plane along
Im
√
n2 sin2 α = 0.
(15.44c)
We note that
qe = k
√
n2 sin2 α
is the wave number in the –z direction inside the earth and thus Im qe must be negative
because
|||ejqez||| = e−(Im qe)z
for z < 0
vanishes as z →–∞. Therefore,
Im
√
n2 −sin2 α < 0
(15.45a)
corresponds to the wave attenuating in the –z direction satisfying the radiation con-
dition, and thus this may be called the proper Riemann surface. On the other hand,
Im
√
n2 −sin2 α > 0
(15.45b)
corresponds to the wave exponentially increasing toward z →–∞, and thus, this may
be called the improper Riemann surface. Obviously, the original contour c in (15.42)
is located in the proper Riemann surface. This is shown in Fig. 15.6 (see Appendix
15.B).
15.6
SOMMERFELD POLE AND ZENNECK WAVE
Let us consider the pole given by (15.43a).
n2q + qe = 0.
(15.46)
This is identical to the equation used to determine the propagation constant for the
Zenneck wave. To show this, consider the Zenneck wave propagating in the x direction
along the surface at z = 0. Then for z > 0, we have
π1 = Ae−jλx−jqz,
(15.47)
and for z < 0, we write
π2 = Be−jλx+jqez.

Now satisfying the boundary condition,
n2 π = continuous

∂π

we get
A = n2B
and
−jqA = jqeB.
From this, we get (15.46).
Let us find the solution λp from (15.46). Substituting q2 = k2 – λ2 and q2
e = k2n2 −
λ2 into (15.46) and squaring both sides of n2q = –qe, we get n4(k2 −λ2

(15.49)
We note here that by squaring qe = –n2q, we introduced an additional solution
corresponding to qe = +n2q. This is the solution with exp(+jqz) for z > 0, and
therefore it is in the improper Riemann surface. To see this more clearly, we obtain q
using (15.49),
q = ±
k
(n2 + 1)1∕2 .
(15.50)

SOMMERFELD POLE AND ZENNECK WAVE
523
Now we need to choose the sign for q such that it satisfies (15.46). Noting that
−n2q = qe and that Imqe must be negative, we require that Im(–n2q) be negative.
However, considering that Im(n2) is negative, we see that Im[n2/(n2 + 1)1/2] is
also negative. Thus, to make Im(–n2q) negative, we must choose the minus sign in
(15.50).
q = −

(n2 + 1)1∕2 ,
λp =
nk
(n2 + 1)1∕2 ,
qe =
n2k
(n2 + 1)1∕2 .
(15.51)
For detailed behavior of the locations of the Sommerfeld poles, see Appendix 15.B.
For conducting earth, |n| is normally much greater than unity, and therefore we
can get the following approximate solution from (15.51):
λp ≈k
(
1 −
1
2n2
)
.
(15.52)
Next we examine the Sommerfeld pole in the complex α plane:
λp = k sin αp.
(15.53)
Following the procedure indicated above for q, we get
cos αp =
1
(n2 + 1)1∕2 ,
sin αp =
1
(n2 + 1)1∕2 .
(15.54)
Here cos αp is in the third quadrant.
Re(cos αp) < 0
and
Im(cos αp) < 0.
Therefore, αp must be located in T2 of Fig. 15.6. Considering that |n| ≫1, we see
that αp is located very close to π/2 and is slightly below the 45◦line, as can be seen
below and in Fig. 15.7.

For our problem (15.42), we have
f(α) = −j cos(α −θ),
z = kR2.
(15.57)
Therefore, the saddle point is at αs = θ, and
f(α) −f(αs) = j[cos(α −θ) −1] = −s2

The path of integration for I1 is on the steepest descent contour (SDC) and is along
the real axis of s. The original contour of c and SDC in the α plane and the s plane are
pictured in Fig. 15.8. Because of (15.59), two branch points (Br1 and Br2) appear at
s = ± 2e–j(π/4) in the s plane, but these branch points are far from saddle point and have
little effect on the integral. Note that the integrand for I1 has no pole, and therefore
I1 can be evaluated numerically by expressing the integrand in (15.56) as a function

where xi is the ith zero of the Hermite polynomial Hn(x), Wi the weighting coefficient,
and Rn the remainder. The table for xi and Wi is available in Abramowitz and Stegun
(1964, p. 924).
Alternatively, we can use the series expansion (15C.31) in Appendix 15.C. The
series expansion is given by

However, this term B0 can be shown to be vanishingly small as |n| becomes large,
and θ →π/2. Therefore, the series (15.61) starts with the term n = 1, and thus for
large R2, I1 is proportional to 1∕R2
2. This term decays much faster than Ip and I1 is
negligible compared with Ip. Therefore, P is given approximately by I2.

represents the attenuation of the wave from the value for a perfectly conducting
surface and is called the attenuation function.
Let us examine the attenuation function F. F depends only upon p1. p1 is given in
(15.62b), which we write as
p1 = jkR cos(αp −θ) −jkR.
(15.65)
The first term, jkR cos(αp – θ), is the total complex phase from the origin to the
observation point for the Zenneck wave, because
e−jkR cos(αp−θ) = [e−jλρ−jq(z+h)]λ=λp,
where λp is the radial propagation constant for the Zenneck wave given in (15.51).
Therefore, p1 represents the difference between the propagation constant for the
Zenneck wave and the free-space wave.
It is clear, then, that the characteristics of the total wave do not depend on the
distance (kR) alone, but depend on how large or small p1 is. The magnitude of p1 is
called the numerical distance by Sommerfeld.
For small |p1| we have
F = 1 −j
√
π√p1e−p1 + ⋯,
(15.66)
which approaches 1 as p1 →0.
For large |p1| (|p1| > 10), we use the asymptotic expansion

and thus the angle of j√p1 is close to but slightly less than +90◦.

This is the form given in Sommerfeld’s 1926 paper. (See Appendix 15.A, for the
controversies over the sign error.) Equation (15.70) is valid for large kR and moderate
numerical distance. It is not valid for small kR, where the quasi-static approach must

in which case the effect of the pole is negligible and the conventional saddle-point
technique is applicable. Here the field on the surface behaves as

(15.71)
and there is no term exhibiting the Zenneck wave characteristics.
15.8
LATERAL WAVES: BRANCH CUT INTEGRATION
As noted in Section 15.3, we need to consider three points in the complex integration:
the saddle point, poles, and branch points. As may be noted from Section 15.7 for
the Sommerfeld problem of wave propagation over the earth, the pole is very close
to the saddle point, but the branch points are far from the saddle point. Thus, only the
effect of the pole needs to be considered for the Sommerfeld problem for dipoles on
earth.
However, for other problems, where the index of refraction n is smaller than unity,
the pole is far from the saddle point, but the branch point is very close to the saddle
point. Thus the effect of the pole can be neglected, but the effect of the branch
points needs to be taken into account. We first examine the mathematical technique
of handling the branch point and later discuss the physical significance.
Let us examine the reflected wave given in (15.26).

Dipole is located in the medium n1 and |n| = |n2/n1| < 1.
If |n| > 1 as in the case of the earth, αb is located far from the location of the saddle
point αs = θ(0 ≤θ ≤π/2), and this branch point αb has little effect on the wave
propagation over the earth.
However, if n is real and 0 < n < 1, then αb is real and 0 ≤αb ≤π/2, and therefore
the branch cut integration for αb must be taken into account when the saddle-point
integration is performed. For example, consider an antenna located in air below the
ionosphere or an antenna buried underground. In these cases, the index of refraction
n2 of the medium on the other side of the boundary from the antenna is less than that
of the medium n1 where the antenna is located, and thus |n| = |n2/n1| < 1 (Fig. 15.9).
We evaluate (15.73) by means of the saddle-point technique. The saddle-point
contour is shown in Fig. 15.10. We note, first, that if the observation angle θ is
smaller than αb,
θ < αb, αb = sin−1n,

On the other hand, if the observation angle θ is greater than αb,

the integral along C becomes (Fig. 15.11)

However, the contour C1 can be deformed to the branch cut integration (A–B–C)

The physical significance of the angle αb is shown in Fig. 15.13. When the
observation point is within region A(θ < αb), the wave consists of the primary wave
and the reflected wave. Note that the transmitted wave makes an angle θt with the
vertical axis as given by Snell’s law.
sin θ = n sin θt.
(15.78)
When θ exceeds the angle that makes θt = π/2, total reflection occurs. This critical
angle is αb,
sin αb = n.
(15.79)
Therefore, regions A and B correspond to the cases where the angle of incidence θ is
less than or greater than the critical angle for the total reflection.

I = ∫

[F1(α) −F2(α)]e−f(α)dα.
(15.83)
To evaluate this integral, let us first expand f(α) about α = αb and keep the first
term. As will be shown shortly, this is justified because the major contribution to the
integral comes from the immediate neighborhood of αb.
f(α) = f(αb) + (α −αb)
( ∂f

= jkR2 cos(θ −αb) + [jkR2 sin(θ −αb)](α −αb).
(15.84)
Next we deform the contour A–B such that the exponent in (15.84) decays exponen-
tially in a steepest descent path from the branch point αb. To this end, we write the
exponent as
e−jkR2 sin(θ−αb)(α−αb) = e−[kR2 sin(θ−αb)]s,
where s is real, representing the distance from the branch point and obviously
α −αb = −js.

(15.87)
Because the integrand decays exponentially in (15.86), most of the contribution comes
from the neighborhood of s = 0. It is therefore necessary to examine the behavior of
(15.87) in the neighborhood of s = 0.
Near s = 0, (α = αb) we expand (n2 – sin2α) in a Taylor’s series about α = αb and
keep the first term.

(15.93)
Let us examine the physical meaning of (15.93). First, we note that the phase front is
given by
kL0 + knL1 + kL2 = constant.
This shows that this wave first propagates over the distance L0 with free-space
propagation constant k and is incident on the surface at the critical angle αb. Then the
wave propagates just below the surface with the propagation constant of the lower
medium kn, and at the same time, radiating into the upper medium in the direction
of the critical angle. This is pictured in Fig. 15.15. This particular wave is called
the lateral wave, headwave (kopfwelle), or flank wave (flankenwelle). The lateral
wave is related to the following seismic phenomenon. Let the seismic impulse (the
earthquake) originate at a point on the surface at t = 0. The wave propagates faster
in the ground than in the air. (v(air) < v(ground) and thus n = v(air)/v(ground) < 1.)
Thus the wavefronts at t in the air and in the ground are different on the surface
(Fig. 15.16). But there should be no discontinuity in the wavefront, and therefore
there is a wave whose wavefront is tangential from the wavefront in the ground to
the wavefront in the air. This particular wavefront propagates in exactly the same
direction as the lateral wave. Moreover, on the ground this wave arrives first and thus
is called the head wave.

In addition to this particular phase characteristic, the lateral wave has a distinct

.
Because of this dependence, πl becomes infinite as L1 →0. This is because of the
approximation used to obtain (15.93). In fact, as L1 →0, the saddle point approaches
the branch point (θ →αb), and thus the saddle point and the branch cut integration
cannot be performed separately. The field in the neighborhood of L1 →0 (or θ →αb)
is examined in Brekhovskikh (1960) showing the “caustic” behavior.
The lateral wave described above occurs when 0 < n < 1. An example is the
ionosphere, in which n =
√
1 −(ωp∕ω)2. Another important case where the lateral
wave plays a dominant role is the problem of communication between two points in
the absorbing medium such as the ocean or the earth (Fig. 15.17). In this case, k is
complex and its magnitude is large, but kn is the free-space wave number, and thus
|n| < 1. Due to absorption, the direct wave and the reflected wave are almost completely
attenuated in the medium. But the lateral wave propagates from the antenna to the
surface suffering some attenuation, then propagates in the air without attenuation
over a long distance and then arrives at the receiver. Thus the communication is only
through the lateral wave in this case. The communication between two points in the
forest is often done by the lateral wave.

where α1 and α2 satisfy Snell’s law,
sin α1 = n sin α2.
Thus the wave from the dipole arrives at the surface and refracts according to Snell’s
law and propagates to the observation point. The total phase is then
f(λs) = j(λρ + qh −qez)λs
= j(kL0 + knLt).

(15.101)
Equation (15.100) is based on the saddle-point technique, and therefore it is valid
when the dipole and the observation point are sufficiently far from the surface. It can
be shown that expression (15.100) is identical to that obtained by the application of
geometric optical techniques. In general, use of the saddle-point technique leads to
the geometric optical solution.
15.10
RADIATION FROM A HORIZONTAL DIPOLE
In contrast with the azimuthally uniform radiation from a vertical dipole, the radiation
from a horizontal dipole is directional. Furthermore, on the surface of the ground, most
radiation is in the direction of the dipole axis. This is in contrast with the radiation
in free space, where the radiation is broadside (in the direction perpendicular to
the axis). One important practical case where a horizontal dipole is essential is the
radiation from a buried antenna (antenna buried underground, in ice, or submerged
underwater). In this case it can be shown that the horizontal dipole is most effective
and practical and that a vertical dipole is an ineffective radiator.
Let us now consider a horizontal dipole located at (0, 0, h) and oriented in the x
direction (Fig. 15.19). The primary field can be easily obtained from the x component
of the Hertz potential πx

At this point it may appear that these two functions R(λ) and T(λ) may be determined
by applying the boundary conditions as was done for a vertical dipole. However, this is
not possible. Note that, in general, a complete description of the electromagnetic field
requires two scalar functions (such as πz and π∗
z for TM and TE modes). Therefore, we
need another scalar function in addition to πxs1 and πxs2. Convenient choice, which
was first used by Sommerfeld, is the z component of π, πzs1, and πzs2.
Let us now examine the boundary conditions at z = 0. At z = 0, the tan-
gential electric fields Ex and Ey and the tangential magnetic field, Hx and Hy
must be continuous. We write these conditions in terms of πx and πz, noting that

We note that if the second medium is perfectly conducting, Equation (15.107) reduces
to a correct image representation. Now we use (15.105b) and (15.105c) to obtain πz1
and πz2. First we note from (15.105b) that
∂
∂z(πz1 −πz2) = ∂
∂x(πx2 −πx1).

(15.110)
Equations (15.107) and (15.109) constitute the complete expressions for the field of
a horizontal dipole.
We note that the radiation from (15.107) is mostly in the direction perpendicular
to the axis, as this is similar to the radiation from a horizontal dipole and its image.
On the surface, however, this field is extremely small because the radiation from the
image tends to cancel the direct radiation.
On the other hand, the field due to πz as given in (15.109) is directional because
of the cos ϕ factor. Also, the coefficients A(λ) and B(λ) have the same Sommerfeld
denominator (n2q + qe) as in the vertical dipole. Thus πx produced by a horizontal
dipole does not contribute much to the field on the surface, but it gives rise to πz,
which propagates mostly in the direction of the dipole axis and behaves in a manner
similar to that of the vertical dipole.
15.11
RADIATION IN LAYERED MEDIA
In many practical problems we need to consider more than one interface. For example,
wave propagation over the earth is greatly affected by the presence of the ionosphere,
particularly for VLF and lower frequencies. Also, the thermal ionosphere, which will
be discussed later, may be represented by layers. Another example would be the
radiation from slot or dipole antennas on the surface of a spacecraft or high-speed
vehicle, which may be covered by some protective material (Fig. 15.20). It is therefore
important to study the effects of layers on the radiation field.
Let us consider a vertical dipole located within two interfaces, as shown in Fig.
15.21. As was shown in Section 15.3, the field between two boundaries consists of
the primary wave πp0 and the secondary wave πs0.
πz0 = πp0 + πs0,

Here b1 and a2 represent the outgoing waves.
The boundary conditions at z = 0 and z = h are
n2π = continuous,
∂π
∂z = continuous.
(15.117)
Applying these four conditions, we can determine four constants a0, b0, b1, and a1.
Instead of simply applying (15.117), however, we wish to express these constants in
terms of the reflection and transmission coefficients for the upper and lower media.

(15.118)
To do this, we note that for the upper medium, the incident wave is given by the
Fourier–Bessel transform of
[e−jq(z−z0) + a0e−jqz],
and the reflected wave is given by
[b0 ejqz] .
The ratio of these two at z = h must be the reflection coefficient R2. Thus
R2[e−jq(h−z0) + a0 e−jqh] = [b0 ejqh].
(15.119)
www.ebook3000.com

544
RADIATION FROM A DIPOLE ON THE CONDUCTING EARTH
Similarly, at z = 0, we have
R1[e−jqz0 + b0] = a0.
(15.120)
Solving these two equations for a0 and b0, we obtain
a0 = R1 e−jqz0 + R1R2e−jq(2h−z0)
1 −R1R2 e−j2qh
,
(15.121)
b0 = R2 e−jq(h−z0) + R1R2e−jq(h−z0)
1 −R1R2 e−j2qh

(15.122)
Similarly, we can obtain b1(λ) and a2(λ) by using T1 and T2.
b1 = T1 e−jqz0 + T1R2e−jq(2h−z0)
1 −R1R2 e−j2qh

a2 = T2 e−jqz0 + T2R1 e−jq(2h+z0)

ejq2h.
(15.124)
Substituting (15.121) to (15.124) into (15.112) to (15.115), we get a complete expres-
sion of the field.
Let us now examine these expressions. We first look for singularities in the inte-
grand. It is clear that there are poles located at the roots of
1 −R1R2e−j2qh = 0.
(15.125)
In general, there are infinite number of roots for (15.125) and thus there is a series of
poles in the λ plane. This will be discussed further later.
It is also noted that the integrand contains q, q1, and q2, given by
q =
√
k2 −λ2,
q1 =
√
k2
1 −λ2,
q2 =
√
k2
2 −λ2,
and thus it appears that there are three branch points in the λ plane: at λ =
± k, λ = ± k1, and λ = ± k2. However, closer examination reveals that there is
no branch point at λ = ± k. This can be proved by showing that the integrand is
unchanged when q is changed to –q. Another point of view is to recognize that in
describing the field in (15.113), there is no need to differentiate + q and –q. For
example, in (15.113), e–jqz represents the upward wave, but by changing it to e+jqz,
we simply interchange the role of a0 (and b0) from upward (downward) to downward
(upward). However, for q1 and q2, we do need to differentiate +q1 and –q1, +q2 and
–q2 because one represents the outgoing wave satisfying the radiation condition, and

15.12
GEOMETRIC OPTICAL REPRESENTATION
Let us now evaluate the integrals in the expressions (15.111)–(15.115). We may
proceed along the following two lines:
1. Geometric optical representation. This is based on the saddle-point technique
and is applicable to the case where the height h is many wavelengths high.
2. Mode and lateral wave representation. This is based on the residue series and
the branch cut integration and is useful when the height h is small. We now
show the details of these two approaches.
As an example, we take the field in the upper medium z > h, which is given by
(15.115) and (15.124). Noting the two exponential terms in (15.124), we write πs2 as
follows:

We now show that each of un represents the wave successively refracted and reflected
at the boundaries.
We note that the first term,
u0 = T2 e−jq(h−z0)−jq(z−h),
represents the wave originating from the dipole, traveling over the distance (h –
z0) with the propagation constant q, reaching the upper surface, traveling over the
distance (z – h) with the propagation constant q2 and arriving at the observation point
(Fig. 15.23).

are the total path lengths from the dipole to the point where the ray leaves the surface,
and L1 and L2 are the path lengths from the surfaces to the observation point. All Un
and Vn can be expressed in a similar manner.
Since the saddle-point technique is used to obtain (15.134), it is valid only when
the distances L0, L1, L2, and L3 are large. This occurs when the height h is large and
the observation point is far from the surface.
On the other hand, if h is small but the observation point is far from the surface,
we can apply the saddle-point technique to (15.126) directly. We write (15.127) and

In general, the residues have a radial dependence of the form

(15.139)
and represent waveguide modes. On the other hand, the branch cut integration has
the characteristics of the lateral wave as shown in Fig. 15.26. Therefore, if k1 and k2
are lossy, the waveguide modes dominate as we would expect in the case of a lossy
waveguide. On the other hand, if k1 and k2 are lossless, the lateral wave contributes
most to the field.
It is obvious that if the height is small, there are small numbers of propagating
modes and the other modes are almost cut off, implying that the residue series is
highly convergent. On the other hand, if h is large, there may be a great number of
propagating modes and the residue series is slowly convergent, and thus the geometric
optical approach is more useful.

CHAPTER 16
INVERSE SCATTERING
In the usual scattering problem, we specify the object and the incident wave, and
then we attempt to find the scattered wave. This is the direct problem. In contrast,
in the inverse problem, we measure the scattered wave for a given incident wave,
and then we attempt to determine the properties of the object. Two considerations
are important in the inverse problem. First, our measurements are normally limited
and we can only measure certain quantities within some ranges. Second, we need
an effective inverse method so that we can determine the object characteristics with
limited measured data. It is clear, therefore, that the inverse solution may not be
unique and that the existence of the solution may not be apparent. It is also common
that the inverse solution is unstable, so that a slight error in the measurement may
create a large error in the unknown. In this chapter, we outline several inversion
techniques and their advantages and disadvantages. Also in this chapter, we use the
convention exp(–iωt) commonly used in optics and acoustics, rather than exp(jωt)
used in electrical engineering and by the IEEE, because there are many references in
acoustics and physics on this topic.

image of the object. Let us consider a two-dimensional cross section of an object
whose attenuation coefficient is given by f(x, y) (Fig. 16.1). The object is illuminated
uniformly in the direction of ̂η with the intensity I0. The transmitted power It(ξ) is
reduced by the total attenuation through the object and is given by
It(ξ) = I0 exp
[
−∫f(x, y)dη
]
.
(16.1)
Letting ln(I0/It) = Pϕ(ξ), we have
Pϕ(ξ) = ∫f(x, y)dη.
(16.2)
The function Pϕ(ξ) represents the total attenuation at ξ when the object is illuminated
at the angle ϕ and is called the projection. The inverse problem is then to find f(x, y)
from the measured projection Pϕ(ξ). We can also rewrite (16.2) as follows:
Pϕ(ξ) = ∫
f(x, y)δ(ξ −̄r ⋅̂ξ) dx dy,
(16.3)
where ̄r = x̂x + ŷy and ̄r ⋅̂ξ = x cos ϕ + y sin ϕ and 0 ≤ϕ < π, – ∞≤ξ ≤+ ∞.
Equation 16.3 can be considered a type of transform from f(x, y) to Pϕ(ξ) and is
called the Radon transform. Therefore, the inverse problem is that of finding the
inverse Radon transform. This was first studied by Radon in 1917 (Devaney, 1982;
Kak, 1979; Herman, 1979).

557
Let us first consider a one-dimensional Fourier transform of the projection.
̄Pϕ(K) = ∫
∞
−∞
Pϕ(ξ)e−jKξ dξ.
(16.4)
Substituting (16.3) and integrating with respect to ξ, we get
̄Pϕ(K) = ∫f(x, y)e−𝑖K̂ξ⋅̄rdx dy.
(16.5)
This is the two-dimensional Fourier transform of f(x, y) evaluated at ̄K = K̂ξ
̄Pϕ(K) = F(K̂ξ),
(16.6)
where
F( ̄K) = ∫f(x, y)e−𝑖̄K⋅̄r dx dy,
and 0 ≤ϕ < π, – ∞≤K ≤∞.
We may think of ̄Pϕ(K) as the Fourier transform of f(x, y) along a slice at angle
ϕ (Fig. 16.2). Therefore, we state that the one-dimensional Fourier transform of the
projection of an object f(x, y) is a slice at angle ϕ of the Fourier transform F( ̄K) of
f(x, y). This is called the projection slice theorem.
Now the complete Fourier transform of f(x, y) is obtained by summing the slices
over all the K space and f(x, y) is obtained by the inverse Fourier transform. To do
this, consider the inverse Fourier transform
f(x, y) =

is called the filtered projection. It is a function of t = ξ and is independent of η.

ALTERNATIVE INVERSE RADON TRANSFORM IN TERMS OF THE HILBERT TRANSFORM

Pϕ(ξ) as follows:
f(x, y) = 1
2π ∫

̄h(K) = |K| .
Note that the filtered projection Qϕ(t) is obtained from the projection Pϕ(ξ) either
by the inverse Fourier transform of ̄Pϕ(K) filtered with ̄h(K) or by the convolution
integral. Once Qϕ(t) is obtained for a given ϕ, it is summed over all ϕ from 0
to π as shown in (16.12) and the object is reconstructed. This process is called
back projection. Therefore, we speak of the entire process as the back projection
of the filtered projection. Equation (16.12) can be regarded as an inverse Radon
transform to obtain f(x, y) from the Radon transform Pϕ(ξ). Note that if the object is
a delta function f(x, y) = δ(x)δ(y), the reconstructed image is [W/(2πr)]J1(Wr), where
r = (x2 + y2)1/2.
In practice, the calculations of (16.13) are made by digital processing (Kak, 1979).
For example, the sampling interval of Pϕ(ξ) must be τ = 1/(2W) and
Qϕ(nτ) = τ
∑
m
Pϕ(mτ)h[(n −m)τ].
(16.14)
This can also be done by using FFT in the frequency domain in (16.13).

ALTERNATIVE INVERSE RADON TRANSFORM IN TERMS
OF THE HILBERT TRANSFORM
In Section 16.1, we gave an inverse Radon transform in the form of the back projection
of the filtered projection. It is also possible to express the inverse Radon transform
using the Hilbert transform as was done by Radon in 1917. This inversion formula,
however, contains a derivative and is more sensitive to noise.

INVERSE SCATTERING
Let us first consider the Fourier transform of the projection
̄Pϕ(K) = ∫Pϕ(ξ)e−𝑖Kξ dξ .
(16.15)
Note that we are using 𝑖=

We integrate this by parts and noting Pϕ(ξ) vanishes as ξ →± ∞, we obtain
̄Pϕ(K) = ∫

DIFFRACTION TOMOGRAPHY
The X-ray tomography described in Section 16.2 deals with the reconstruction of
the image of an object from the projection obtained by illuminating the object with
uniform X-rays. All rays are assumed to travel in straight lines, and this is true
at the limit of zero wavelengths. If acoustic or electromagnetic waves are used to
reconstruct the object, diffraction effects due to finite wavelengths cannot be ignored.
In general, the formulations of inverse problems, including diffraction, are extremely
complicated and general solutions are not yet available. However, if the scattering is
weak, it is possible to formulate the inverse problem in a manner similar to X-ray
tomography and general solutions can be obtained. This will be presented in this
section (see Devaney, 1982).
For a weakly scattering medium, the field U is represented by the Born approxi-
mation or the Rytov approximation. Let us assume that the field U satisfies the wave
equation
[∇2 + k2n2(x, y)]U(x, y) = 0,
(16.23)

562
INVERSE SCATTERING
where k is the wave number of the background medium and n(x, y) is the refractive
index of the object. For example, the background medium is water in the case of
ultrasound imaging of an object in water, and n represents the deviation of the
refractive index of the object from water. We rewrite (16.23) as
(∇2 + k2)U = −f(x, y)U,
(16.24)
where
f(x, y) = k2(n2 −1).
This can be converted to the following integral equation for U:
U(̄r) = U𝑖(̄r) + ∫G(̄r, ̄r′)f(̄r′)U(̄r′) d̄r′,
(16.25)
where Ui is the incident wave and G(̄r, ̄r′) is Green’s function satisfying the equation
(∇2 + k2)G = −δ(̄r −̄r′).
The first Born approximation is obtained by approximating U in the integrand by the
incident wave
U(̄r) = U𝑖(̄r) + ∫G(̄r, ̄r′)f(̄r′)U𝑖(̄r′) d̄r′.
(16.26)
This is valid when
|k (n −1) D| ≪1,
(16.27)
where D is a typical size of the object.
The Rytov approximation is obtained by considering the total complex phase Ψ
of U. We let
U(x, y) = U𝑖(̄r)eΨ(x,y).
(16.28)
The first Rytov approximation is then given by (see Appendix 16.B)
Ψ(x, y) =
1
U𝑖(̄r) ∫G(̄r, ̄r′)f(̄r′)U𝑖(̄r′) d̄r′.
(16.29)
Note that if we expand the exponent in (16.28) and keep the first term, we obtain
the first Born approximation, and therefore the Rytov approximation contains more
scattering terms and is a better approximation than the first Born approximation. In
either the Born or Rytov solution, we can use the scattered field Us
Us(̄r) = ∫G(̄r, ̄r′)f(̄r′)U𝑖(̄r′) d̄r′.

In the Rytov solution, for a given incident field Ui we measure the total field U
and obtain the field Us by calculating Uiln(U/Ui). The function f(x, y) represents the
object, and the inverse problem is then reduced to finding the object f(x, y) from Us.
Let us consider a two-dimensional cross section of the object f(x, y) illuminated
by a plane wave propagating in the direction ̂s0 (Fig. 16.4).

as given in (16.32), and therefore, if we limit ourselves to the real K1 and K2, this
represents a circle with radius k in the ̄K space. The real K1 and K2 means that only
the propagating wave is considered and the evanescent wave is neglected. We may
rewrite (16.34) using
K1̂ξ + K2̂η = k̂s,
K̂η = k̂s0,
̄Us(K1, l0) = 𝑖e𝑖K2l0
2K2
F[k(̂s −̂s0)].
(16.35)
This means that the Fourier transform of the observed data Us(ξ, l0) at η = l0 is
proportional to the Fourier transform F( ̄K) of the object f(x, y) evaluated at ̄K =
k(̂s −̂s0). This is a semicircle in ̄K space where k > K2 > 0, shown in Fig. 16.6.
This is a generalization of the projection slice theorem for conventional tomography
discussed in Section 16.1. Here, instead of a slice at an angle θ, we have a semicircle
centered at ̄K = −k̂s0. Note that in the high-frequency limit, k →∞and the semicircle
is stretched to a slice for conventional tomography.
For reflection tomography, we note that |η – η′| = η′ + l0 and the Fourier transform
of the observed data Us(ξ, – l0) at η = –l0 is given by
̄Us(K1, −l0) = 𝑖e𝑖K2l0
2K2
F(K1, −K2 −k).
(16.36)
This is the lower half of the semicircle as indicated in Fig. 16.6.

566
INVERSE SCATTERING
From the discussion above, it is clear that the Fourier transform of the observed
data for a given incident direction ̂s0 is proportional to the Fourier transform of the
object evaluated on a semicircle. If we do this process for all angles 0 ≤ϕ < π, we
can cover the K space within the circle of radius
√
2k for transmission tomography
and within the band between the radii from
√
2k to 2k for reflection tomography. We
can then invert the Fourier transform to reconstruct the object. This reconstruction
process is similar to the back projection for conventional tomography, but since
it includes the propagation effect, it is called back propagation and is explained
below. We also note that we can cover a larger K space by varying the frequency
k = ω/c.
Let us consider the forward tomography. Us(ξ, l0) is measured and its one-
dimensional Fourier transform ̄Us(K1, l0) is calculated. We then calculate the function
F(K1, K2 −k) = −𝑖2K2e𝑖K2l0 ̄Us(K1, l0).
(16.37)
From this, we get the object by the inverse Fourier transform:
f(x, y) =
1
(2π)2 ∫F( ̄K)e𝑖̄K⋅̄r dKxdKy,
(16.38)
where ̄K = k(̂s −̂s0).
Now we note that
̄K = K1̂ξ + (K2 −k)̂η
̂ξ = cos ϕ̂x + sin ϕ̂y
̂η = −sin ϕ̂x + cos ϕ̂y.
(16.39)
Therefore, we get
̄K = Kx̂x + Kŷy
Kx = K1 cos ϕ −(K2 −k) sin ϕ
Ky = K1 sin ϕ + (K2 −k) cos θ.

also be written as a convolution integral as shown in Section 16.1.

PHYSICAL OPTICS INVERSE SCATTERING
Based on the physical optics approximation, it is possible to derive an inversion
formula that gives the size and shape of a conducting object from the knowledge
of the monostatic scattering for all frequencies and all aspect angles. This inverse
scattering formula was first obtained by Bojarski in 1967 and is now known as
Bojarski’s identity (see the survey paper by Bojarski, 1982b and Lewis, 1969).
Let us consider the scattered far field Es from a conducting object.
Es = −jkη0
e−jkR
4πR ∫s
[−̂o × (̂o × Js)]ejk̂o⋅̄r′ ds′,
(16.44)
where η0 = (μ0/ε0)1/2, R is the distance from the reference point on the object, Js is
the surface current density, and ̂o is the direction of observation.

568
INVERSE SCATTERING
For monostatic scattering, ̂o = −̂𝑖where ̂𝑖is the direction of the incident wave.
For physical optics approximation, we have Js = 2(̂n × H𝑖) where ̂n is the unit vector
normal to the surface. We note that
̂𝑖× (̂n × H𝑖) = −H𝑖(̂𝑖⋅̂n),
−̂o × (̂o × Js) = ̂𝑖× H𝑖(̂𝑖⋅̂n).
(16.45)
The scattered wave Es can then be expressed as
Es = jkη0̂e𝑖
e−jkR
4πR ∫s
2(̂𝑖⋅̂n)ej2k̂o⋅r′ ds′
(16.46)
where ̂e𝑖is the unit vector in the direction of the polarization of the incident wave
E𝑖= E𝑖̂e𝑖. This formula shows that the monostatic scattered wave is polarized in the
direction ̂e𝑖, and therefore there is no cross polarization in the monostatic scattered
wave based on physical optics.
Let us now define the normalized complex far-field scattering amplitude ρ(K)
when illuminated in the direction ̂𝑖. We also use exp(–iωt) dependence rather than
exp(jωt) in this section, as this is commonly used in this work.
ρ(K) =

4π ∫K⋅̂n>0
e−𝑖K⋅r′K ⋅ds′,
(16.47)
where K = 2k̂o = −2k̂𝑖, ds′ = ̂n ds′, and K ⋅̂n > 0 means the illuminated surface
(Fig. 16.7). The normalized complex scattering amplitude ρ(K) is defined so that the
back-scattering cross section σb is given by [see (10.101)]
σb = ρρ∗.
(16.48)
Now we consider the scattered wave when illuminated from the opposite direction
(K →– K). We also take the complex conjugate and obtain
ρ∗(−K) =

Adding ρ(K) and ρ∗(–K), we get
ρ(K) + ρ∗(−K) =
𝑖
√
4π ∫s
e−𝑖K⋅r′K ⋅ds′,
(16.50)
where s is the complete surface of the object.
By using the divergence theorem, the right side of (16.50) becomes

∇⋅(e−𝑖K⋅r′K) dv′ = 2k2
√
π ∫v
e−𝑖K⋅r′ dv′,
(16.51)
where v is the volume of the object.
We can now define the complex scattering amplitude Γ(K) and the characteristic
function γ(r′) of the scatterer.
Γ(K) =
√
π
2k2 [ρ(K) + ρ∗(−K)],
γ(r′) =
{
1
if r′ is inside the scatterer
0
if r′ is outside.
(16.52)
We then get the following three-dimensional Fourier transform relationship:
Γ(K) = ∫v
γ(r′)e−𝑖K⋅r′ dv′
(16.53)
For scatterers of finite volume, we can invert this Fourier transform and obtain
γ(r) =
1
(2π)3 ∫Γ(K)e𝑖K⋅r d K.
(16.54)
This is Bojarski’s identity and shows that the object shape can be determined by
measuring the back-scattered far field over all K. This requires that the back scattering
be known for all frequencies and all angles, which presents a practical measurement
difficulty. Also, the identity is based on the physical optics approximation, which
is valid only for high frequencies and should not be used for lower frequencies or
resonance regions. This is another source of theoretical difficulty. Therefore, much
of the work is directed to obtaining solutions even if the scattering information is
incomplete (see Bojarski, 1982b; Lewis, 1969).
If the measurement of the scattered wave can be made only in some portion D of
the K space, we write
A(K) =
{
1
if K is in D,
0
if K is outside.
(16.55)

570
INVERSE SCATTERING
Then we can measure A(K)Γ(K). The inverse Fourier transform is then given by
f(r) =
1
(2π)3 ∫A(K)Γ(K)e𝑖K⋅r dK.
(16.56)
This is given by
f(r) = ∫A(r −r′)γ(r′) dv′
= ∫A(r′)γ(r −r′) dv′,
(16.57)
where
A(r) =
1
(2π)3 ∫A(K)e𝑖K⋅r dK.
In (16.57), f(r) is calculated from the measurement and A(r) is also known, and
therefore this constitutes an integral equation for γ(r).
As an example, suppose that the measurement is conducted only from one direction
̂z. Then D is the line Kx = Ky = 0 and therefore
A(K) = δ(Kx)δ(Ky).
(16.58)
We then get
A(r) =
1
(2π)3 ∫e𝑖Kzz dKz =
1
(2π)2 δ(z).
Substituting this in (16.57), we get
f(r) =
1
(2π)2 ∫∫γ(x, y, z) dx dy.
(16.60)
This means that f(r) calculated from the measured data gives the cross-sectional area
of the target as a function of z.

HOLOGRAPHIC INVERSE SOURCE PROBLEM
If the field Ψ and its normal derivative ∂Ψ/∂n produced by a source ρ(r) are measured
over a surface S, it should be possible to reconstruct the source distribution ρ(r) from
the knowledge of Ψ and ∂Ψ/∂n on S. This inversion technique has been developed
independently by Porter and Bojarski. This is based on the same principle as con-
ventional holography, in which the scattered field is recorded on a photographic film
which, when illuminated, reproduces the source distribution (see Bojarski, 1982a, for
a review; see also Porter and Devaney, 1982; and Tsang et al., 1987).

From knowledge of the surface field Ψ(rs) and ∂Ψ(rs)/∂n, Γ(r) can be calculated, and
by solving the integral equation, the source distribution ρ(r′) can be obtained.
An alternative form of the integral equation is possible. We may use the conjugate
field Ψ∗and obtain
∇∗(r) = ∫K(r, r′)r∗(r′)dV′.
(16.67)
The solutions to the integral equations (16.66) and (16.67) are, however, not
unique. The source ρ consists of the nonradiating sources ρn and the radiating sources
ρr. The nonradiating source generates a field that is identically zero outside the source
region and does not contribute to the field on S. It has been shown that if we minimize
the source energy E,
E = ∫|ρ|2 dV,
(16.68)
it yields a unique solution. For a detailed discussion on the uniqueness and nonradiat-
ing sources, see Porter and Devaney (1982) and Cohen and Bleistein (1979). Also see
Devaney and Porter (1985) and Tsang et al. (1987) for inversion of inhomogeneous

where fp = ωp/2π is plasma frequency, e and m are the charge and mass of an electron,
ε0 is the free-space permittivity, and the loss is neglected.
If we send up a radio wave of angular frequency ω, it reaches the height h where
ωp is equal to ω and returns to the ground. The time T(ω) for the wave to travel to
z = h and return to z = 0 is given by
T(ω) = 2 ∫

and the height h at the turning point at a frequency ω is given by
ω = ωp(h).
For a given profile of Ne(z), and therefore ωp(z), we can calculate T(ω) from (16.70).
This is called the direct problem.
Now consider the inverse problem. We send up radio waves at various frequencies
and measure T(ω) as a function of ω. From the measured data T(ω), we attempt to
determine the plasma frequency profile ωp(z) and the electron density profile Ne(z).
This is the inverse problem (Fig. 16.9).

Here g(ω) is the measured data and ωp(z) is the unknown. This is a nonlinear equation

where the upper limit of integration is determined by E = V(h). We assume that V(z)
is a monotonic function of z. Here we used E and V, as this problem is identical to
the problem of sliding a particle up a frictionless hill with initial kinetic energy E and
measuring the time T(E) required for the particle to return. The time T(E) is measured
for different E and the shape of the hill represented by the potential energy V(h) =

RADAR POLARIMETRY AND RADAR EQUATION

RADAR POLARIMETRY AND RADAR EQUATION
In Section 10.2 we discussed the conventional radar equation in the following form:
Pr
Pt
=
λ2
(4π)3
GtGr
R2
1R2
2
σb𝑖m,
(16.76)
where Pr is the received power; Pt the transmitted power; Gt and Gr the gain of
the transmitter and receiver; R1 and R2 are distance from transmitter to object and
distance from object to receiver, respectively; σbi the bistatic cross section of the
object; and m the mismatch factor. If both impedance and polarizations are matched,
m = 1, but 0 < m < 1 otherwise. This conventional radar equation deals with the total
power received, but it gives no specific information about the relationships among the
polarization characteristics of the transmitter, the object, and the receiver. However,
recent advances in measurement techniques have made possible acquisition of more
detailed polarization information and thus have stimulated intensive research on radar
polarimetry, which is the utilization of the complete polarization characteristics in
radar. The polarimetric techniques are also applicable to the remote sensing of the
terrain and the discrimination of signals from clutter, interference, and jamming
(Boerner, 1985; Huynen, 1978).
Let us now reexamine the radar equation. Following Section 10.2, we first consider
a field incident on the object. We assume that the object is in the far field of both the
transmitting and receiving antennas. Since the incident flux density Si at the object is
S𝑖= | ̄Et|2∕2η, where ̄Et is the electric field, we write
̄Et = (2ηS𝑖)1∕2 ̄Etn,
S𝑖= GtPt
4πR2
1
,
(16.77)
where Etn is the normalized transmitted field with || ̄Etn|| = 1. We now express ̄Et in
an orthogonal coordinate system
̄Et = Et1̂x1 + Et2̂x2.
(16.78)
For example, in a spherical system, we have
̄Et = Etθ̂θ + Etϕ ̂ϕ.
(16.79)
This wave, ̄Et, is incident on the target. The scattered wave, ̄Es, at the receiver is then
given by
[Es] = e𝑖kR2

Now consider the received power Pr when ̄Es is incident on the receiving antenna.
This problem has been investigated in detail. (See Collin and Zucker, 1969, Chapter
4; Lo and Lee, 1988, Chapter 6). First, it has been shown that when the wave ̄Es is
incident on the receiving antenna, the open-circuit voltage V0 is given by
V0 = ̄h ⋅̄Es,
(16.82)
where ̄h is called the complex effective height of the antenna (Fig. 16.10). It is given
by the radiation field ̄Er when the receiver is used as a transmitter. If the receiver is
fed by the current ̄Ir, the far field is given by (9.26) of Section 9.2.
̄Er = −jωμ0
4πR e−jkR ̄N.

If the input impedance of the antenna is Zi and the load impedance is Zl = Rl + iXl,
the received power Pr is given by
Pr = 1

(16.85)

where Sr is the power flux density and the receiving cross section Ar is given by
Ar =

| ̄Es|2 q.
(16.88)
If the impedance is matched, q = 1, and if the polarization is matched, |̄h ⋅̄Es|2 takes
its maximum value |̄h|2| ̄Es|2.
If both the impedance and polarization are matched, the receiving cross section
is equal to (λ2/4π)Gr, where Gr is the gain of the receiving antenna. Therefore, we
write
Ar = λ2
4πGrpq,
(16.89)
where
p = |̄h ⋅̄Es|2
|̄h|2| ̄Es|2 = |̄hn ⋅̄Esn|2;
̄hn and Esn are normalized such that |̄hn| = 1 and | ̄Esn| = 1. Combining (16.77),
(16.80), and (16.89), we get

|̄hn ⋅̄Esn|2| ̄̄F ⋅̄Etn|2,
(16.91)
where ̄hn, ̄Esn, and ̄Etn are all normalized so that |̄hn|2 = 1, | ̄Esn|2 = 1, and | ̄Etn|2 = 1.
In matrix notation, we write
V0n = ̄hn ⋅̄Esn = [hn]t[Esn]
V = ̄̄F ⋅̄Etn = [F][Etn].
(16.92)
The sense of polarization used in V0n can be confusing, and therefore it is important
to test them for known physical problems. First, if LHC is transmitted to a specular
reflector such as a conducting plate, the scattered wave will be RHC propagating
toward the receiver. Then the received voltage is null. For this case
̄hn =
1
√
2
(̂x −𝑖̂y),
̄Esn =
1
√
2
(̂x −𝑖̂y).
Therefore, V0n = 0.
Another example is two identical helical antennas facing each other. Then if LHC
is transmitted, ̄Esn at the receiver is
̄Esn =
1
√
2
(̂x + 𝑖̂y).
The complex effective height for the identical antennas is then
̄hn =
1
√
2
(̂x −𝑖̂y).
Thus V0n = 1 and they are polarization matched.
16.8
OPTIMIZATION OF POLARIZATION
Let us now consider the optimization problem. We attempt to find the polarization
of the transmitter and the polarization of the receiver such that the received power
is maximum. This will be done in three stages (Kostinski and Boerner, 1986). First,
www.ebook3000.com

OPTIMIZATION OF POLARIZATION
579
we attempt to find the polarization of the transmitter to maximize |V|2 in (16.92). We
have, using matrix notation,
|V|2 = V∗V = [Etn]+[F]+[F][Etn]
= [Etn]+[G][Etn],
(16.93)
where + means “adjoint” (complex conjugate of transpose). [G] = [F]+ [F] is called
Graves power matrix and is Hermitian (see Appendix 8.A),
[G]+ = [G].
(16.94)
To maximize |V|2, consider the eigenvalue equation
[G][X] = λ[X],
(16.95)
where λ is the eigenvalue and [X] is normalized so that [X]+ [X] = 1. Now we multiply
(16.95) from the left by [X]+. We then get
[X]+[G][X] = λ[X]+[X] = λ.
(16.96)
Therefore, the maximum value of [X]+ [G][X] is given by the maximum eigenvalue
λ. Furthermore,
λ∗= {[X]+[G][X]}+ = [X]+[G]+[X] = [X]+[G][X] = λ.
(16.97)
Therefore, the eigenvalue λ is real. The eigenvalue λ is easily found from (16.95)
|||||
g11 −λ

ization for [Et] obtained in (16.99), and in the third stage we adjust the receiver
polarization state ̄hn to maximize |V0n|2 = |̄hn ⋅̄Esn|2. This optimum polarization
state is given by (Collin and Zucker, 1969, p. 108)

STOKES VECTOR RADAR EQUATION AND

and [It] is normalized so that Itn1 + Itn2 = 1. This is incident on the object and the
scattered Stokes vector [Is] is given by
[Is] = [M][S𝑖],
(16.102)
where [M] is a 4 × 4 Mueller matrix (Section 10.10). Now consider the received
power Pr. Since this is proportional to |̄h ⋅̄Es|2, we first express |̄h ⋅̄Es|2 using the
Stokes vector. ̄h = h1̂e1 + h2̂e2 is the transmitted wave and ̄Es = Es1̂e1 + Es2(−̂e2) is
the incoming wave (Fig. 16.11). Note that ̄h is directed to ̂e1 × ̂e2, but ̄Es is directed
to ̂e1 × (−̂e2). Therefore, we get

V = 2IM⟨E1E∗

of the phase. When E1 and E2 are randomly varying in time, the coherent measurement
must be done within a fraction of the coherent time and therefore requires fast and
accurate measurement.

CHAPTER 17
RADIOMETRY, NOISE TEMPERATURE,
AND INTERFEROMETRY
In this chapter we first discuss radiometry, which is the passive detection of natural
radiation from various media, targets, and objects. Included in this discussion are
brightness, antenna temperature, radiative transfer, and emissivity. The effects of
the receiving system on the system noise temperature and the minimum detectable
temperature are discussed, and the chapter concludes with the use of interferometry
for mapping the brightness distribution (see Brookner, 1977; King, 1970; Kraus,
1966; Skolnik, 1970, 1980; Tsang et al., 1985; and Ulaby et al., 1981).
17.1
RADIOMETRY
All natural and man-made objects, terrain, and atmospheric media emit electromag-
netic energy. Thermal emission is generally dominant. They also scatter the radiation
incident on them. A radiometer is a very sensitive, low-noise receiver that detects nat-
ural incoherent radiation from these objects. Typical radiometers monitor broadband
continuous radiation and the received power is proportional to the bandwidth of the
receiver. Radiometers are used on earth-orbiting satellites and on the ground to probe
atmospheric conditions and terrain and to detect targets at microwave, millimeter
wave, and infrared frequencies. They are also used for medical applications to probe
radiation from biological media.

BRIGHTNESS AND FLUX DENSITY
The fundamental quantity in radiometry is the brightness B. Consider a small area
da and the power flux density incident on this area from the direction ̂s within a
unit frequency band centered at frequency ν within a unit solid angle (Fig. 17.1).
This quantity B (̂s) is called the brightness and is measured in W m–2Hz–1sr–1 (sr =
steradian = unit solid angle). The brightness B is also called the specific intensity in
radiative transfer theory and radiance in infrared radiometry. The amount of power
dP flowing through the area da within the solid angle dΩ in a frequency interval
(v, v + dv) is therefore given by
dP = B cos θ da dΩ dv.
(17.1)
At a given location, the brightness B is a function of the direction ̂s, and therefore
we may call B (̂s) the brightness distribution. The variation of the brightness B with
the frequency is called the brightness spectrum.
The brightness B of the solar disk at λ = 0.5 μm is 1.33 × 10−12 and the brightness
of rough ground at λ = 3.9 cm is 5.4 × 10−24. Coherent sources such as lasers and
radars present a completely different situation. For example, the brightness of an
argon ion laser at λ = 0.5145 μm is 7.1 × 103, and the brightness of a Haystack
X-band radar at λ = 3.9 cm is 4.8 × 103 (Skolnik, 1970).
Let us consider a receiving antenna whose receiving cross section is given by
Ar(θ, ϕ). The received power Pr in W/Hz is then given by (Fig. 17.2)
Pr = 1
2 ∫4π
B(θ, ϕ)Ar(θ, ϕ) dΩ,
(17.2)
where the integral is over all solid angles, and the factor 1
2 is introduced because
normally the brightness radiation is incoherent and unpolarized while any antenna
receives only one polarization. In general, however, if the brightness is partially
polarized, the factor can be between 0 and 1.
If we normalize the receiving cross section Ar to the maximum value Arm, we write
Ar(θ, ϕ) = ArmPn(θ, ϕ).

(17.4)
where S(W m−2Hz−1) is called the observed flux density.
S = ∫4π

(17.5)
Note also that the maximum receiving cross section Arm and the maximum gain Gm
are related by

4πGm.
(17.6)
The total flux density from the source is given by
Ss = ∫4π
B(θ, ϕ) dΩ,
(17.7)
and is called the source flux density. The unit for flux density is Wm−2/Hz−1; in
radio astronomy, this is called 1 jansky (= 1 Wm−2/Hz−1) after the pioneer radio
astronomer K. G. Jansky. The flux density of most radio sources in radio astronomy
is on the order of 10−26 jansky.

BLACKBODY RADIATION AND ANTENNA TEMPERATURE
All objects emit electromagnetic energy. They may also absorb and scatter the energy
incident on them. According to Kirchhoff, a good absorber of electromagnetic energy

RADIOMETRY, NOISE TEMPERATURE, AND INTERFEROMETRY
is also a good emitter. A perfect absorber that absorbs electromagnetic energy at all
wavelengths is called a blackbody and is also a perfect emitter.
The brightness of the electromagnetic radiation from a blackbody depends only
on its temperature and frequency and is given by Planck’s radiation law:
B (blackbody) = 2hv3
c2
1
exp(hv∕kT) −1,
(17.8)
where h is Planck’s constant (6.63 × 10−34 J⋅s), v the frequency (Hz), c the velocity
of light (3 × 108 m s−1), K is Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K), and T is the
temperature (K).
For microwave and millimeter waves, hν is much smaller than KT; only in infrared
and shorter wavelengths does hν become comparable to or greater than KT, exhibiting
quantum effects. For microwave and millimeter waves, therefore, we can approximate
exp(hν/KT) by 1 + hν/KT and obtain the Rayleigh–Jeans law
B (blackbody) = 2K
λ2 T.
(17.9)
Note that brightness is proportional to temperature (Fig. 17.3).
For an actual object that is not a blackbody, the brightness is not proportional to its
actual temperature as given in (17.9). However, we can define the equivalent black-
body temperature Ts which gives the brightness identical to the actual brightness B.
B = 2K
λ2 Ts.
(17.10)
This equivalent temperature Ts is called the source temperature. Since B is a function
of the direction B(θ, ϕ), the source temperature is also a function of the direction
Ts(θ, ϕ).

The received power Pr in (17.2) is then given by
Pr = K
λ2 ∫Ts(θ, ϕ) Ar(θ, ϕ) dΩ.
(17.11)
Nothing that
∫Ar(θ, ϕ) dΩ = λ2,
(17.12)
as shown in Section 9.1, we get
Pr = KTA,
(17.13)
where K is Boltzmann’s constant and
TA = ∫Ts(θ, ϕ) Pn(θ, ϕ) dΩ
∫Pn(θ, ϕ) dΩ
This quantity TA is called the antenna temperature. As an example, if the source is
uniform over a small solid angle Ωs and the antenna receiving pattern is confined
within a solid angle ΩA, we have
TA =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
TsΩs
ΩA
if Ωs < ΩA,
Ts
if Ωs > ΩA.
(17.14)
This ratio Ωs/ΩA is called the fill factor.
The antenna temperature TA is also equal to the temperature of a resistor that
produces the same noise power as the actual power Pr (Fig. 17.4). According to
Nyquist’s formula, the open-circuit rms noise voltage (Johnson noise or thermal
noise) across a resistor R at temperature T in the frequency band dν is given by
V = (4RKT dv)1∕2.
(17.15)
The available power W per unit frequency band produced by this resistor when it is
transmitted to a matched load is 1
2 (V2∕2R), and therefore
W = KT.
(17.16)
To show that this is equal to the antenna temperature, note that the antenna temperature
is also equal to the temperature of a blackbody enclosure in which the antenna is
embedded (Fig. 17.4). In this case Ts is constant, and therefore, from (17.13)
Pr = KT.

EQUATION OF RADIATIVE TRANSFER
In Section 17.3, we discussed the source temperature and the antenna temperature.
The source temperature may originate outside the atmosphere, such as the sun.
Also, the source temperature may come from the atmosphere itself or the ground.
This section and Section 17.5 deal with the emission, propagation, absorption, and
scattering of the temperature in the atmosphere and the ground.
Let us consider the propagation of the brightness in a medium emitting electromag-
netic radiation. An example is the brightness in the atmosphere. Since the brightness
B is proportional to the equivalent temperature T, we may use the temperature in place
of the brightness. As the brightness B (or T) propagates in the direction ̂s through the
medium, it is partly absorbed and partly scattered (Fig. 17.5). We therefore write
dT
ds = −γT,

where
γ = Extinction coefficient

γa = Absorption coefficient,
γs = Scattering coefficient.
The brightness is also increased by the scattering into the direction ̂s from the bright-
ness coming from all other directions

4π ∫4π
p (̂s, ̂s′) T(̂s′) dΩ′,
where p (̂s, ̂s′) is called the phase function (Ishimaru, 1978). The brightness is also
increased by the emission from the medium with temperature Tm. The emission
is equal to the absorption according to Kirchhoff’s law; therefore, we have γaTm.
Collecting all these terms, we get the equation of radiative transfer (Fig. 17.5)
dT
ds = −γT + 1
4π ∫p (̂s, ̂s′) T(̂s) dΩ′ + γaTm.
(17.19)
In most microwave radiometry, the scattering effect is negligible compared with the
absorption, and therefore we write
dT
ds = −γT + γaTm,
(17.20)
where γ ≈γa.
Let us consider a ground-based radiometer pointed upward (Fig. 17.6). The absorp-
tion coefficient of the atmosphere, clouds, or rain at height z is given by γa(z) and
their temperature by Tm(z). The temperature of the external source such as the sun is
Te. The radiometer measures a temperature given by the solution of (17.20):

Note also that if Te = 0 and Tm, γa, and γ are uniform over the height H, we get

(17.22)
For example, rain may be approximated by Tm = 273◦, H ≈3 km, and γa = absorption
coefficient of rain.

SCATTERING CROSS SECTIONS AND ABSORPTIVITY AND
EMISSIVITY OF A SURFACE
All surfaces absorb, scatter, and emit electromagnetic radiation. Let us consider the
plane wave ̄E𝑖incident on a surface in the direction ̂𝜄and the wave ̄Es scattered in
the direction ̂s at a large distance R from the surface (Fig. 17.7). The scattering cross

respectively, and α and β can be v or h for vertical and horizontal polarizations. Thus
we have σ0

(17.28)
When a wave with the polarization state α is incident on a surface in the direction

RADIOMETRY, NOISE TEMPERATURE, AND INTERFEROMETRY
Γα(̂𝑖), called the albedo, is the ratio of the total scattered power to the incident power in
the projected area A cos θi. The fractional power absorbed by the surface is therefore
aα(̂𝑖) = 1 −Γα(̂𝑖).
(17.30)
This quantity aα(̂𝑖) is called absorptivity.
Let us next consider the brightness or the temperature Tα(̂𝑖) emitted in the direction
(−̂𝑖) in the polarization state α from a surface kept at the temperature T (Fig. 17.7). If
the surface is a blackbody, the source temperature should be T. The ratio εα(̂𝑖) of the
actual emission Tα(̂𝑖) to that of a blackbody at temperature T is called emissivity.
Tα(̂𝑖) = εα(̂𝑖)T.
(17.31)
According to Kirchhoff’s law, if the surface is in thermal equilibrium, the absorp-
tion must be equal to the emission, and therefore emissivity is equal to absorptivity,
εα(̂𝑖) = aα(̂𝑖).
(17.32)
A rigorous proof of Kirchhoff’s law (17.32) can be made by considering thermo-
dynamic equilibrium when the surface is surrounded by a blackbody (Tsang et al.
1985).
Equation (17.31) gives the emission from the surface at temperature T, and (17.29),
(17.30), and (17.32) relate the emissivity to the scattering characteristics of the
surface. For example, if the surface is perfectly rough and scatters the radiation in all
directions, it is called a Lambertian surface. In this case, the scattered power || ̄Es||
2
is proportional to the projected surface area A cos θs for a given incident flux in the
projected area A cos θi and γβα(̂s, ̂𝑖) is independent of the polarization. Thus we have
σ0
βα(̂s, ̂𝑖) + σ0
αα(̂s, ̂𝑖) = σ0

(17.33)
Substituting this into (17.29), we get

(17.34)
If the surface is smooth, the scattered wave is in the specular direction and there
is no cross polarization. The albedo Γα(̂𝑖) is then given by the Fresnel reflection
coefficient Rα(̂𝑖)
Γα(̂𝑖) = ||Rα(̂𝑖)||

and the wave is incident from the medium with refractive index n1 to the medium with

As an example, consider a radiometer looking down on the earth (Fig. 17.8).
The temperature T at the radiometer consists of the atmospheric emission T1, the
contribution from the ground T2, and the scattering by the ground T3:
T = T1 + T2 + T3.
(17.37)
The atmospheric emission T1 is given by the emission from the medium with the

(17.39)
where ε is the emissivity of the earth and Tg is the actual temperature of the ground.
The emissivity depends on the angle. The approximate values of the emissivity normal
to the surface are close to unity for grass, 0.93 for dry soil, 0.68 for moist soil, 0.85
for concrete, 0.45 for water, 0.9 for asphalt, and close to zero for metal.
The scattered component T3 is the temperature scattered by the ground when
the sky temperature Tsky is incident on the ground and then attenuated through the
atmosphere. Thus we have
T3 = T3s exp

propagated, absorbed, and scattered, and then reaches the antenna. In this section, we

discuss what happens in the receiver. In addition to the antenna temperature given in
(17.13), the receiver itself contributes to the total noise of the receiving system. Thus
we have the system noise temperature Tsys.
Tsys = TA + Tr,
(17.43)
where Tr is the receiver noise temperature. If the receiver consists of several cascaded
stages with temperature and gain as shown in Fig. 17.9, the gain of the previous stages
effectively reduces the contribution of each stage to the overall system temperature.
Therefore, the system temperature is given by
Tsys = TA + Tr,
Tr = T1 + T2

.
(17.44)
Note that the total available noise power at the output is given by Tout = G1G2Tsys. If
the first stage is a transmission line with loss L(gain = ε = L−1< 1) kept at a physical
temperature of TL, the effective noise temperature at the end of the transmission line
is TL(1 – ε). This is seen by noting that the noise generated in dx is equal to the
absorbed power αTLdx, where α is the attenuation constant. At the end of the line of
length l, we have

where ε = e−αl. We therefore have the noise temperature TL(1 – ε) + Tr for the
attenuator with loss L(gain = ε) followed by the receiver. The total system temperature
is then given by
Tsys = TA + 1
ε [TL(1 −ε) + Tr]
= TA + TL(L −1) + LTr,
(17.45)
where Tr is given in (17.44).

MINIMUM DETECTABLE TEMPERATURE
A receiver that measures the total noise power is called the “total power receiver”
(Fig. 17.10). The detector is normally a square-law device and the output voltage is
proportional to the output noise power. The incident power consists of the broadband
system noise temperature Tsys and the signal noise temperature ΔT. If the bandwidth
of the receiver is B, the output power for the system noise temperature is proportional
to (KTsysB)2 and the output power for the signal is proportional to (KΔTB)2. The
system noise, however, is B effectively independent noise pulses per second. These
pulses are averaged over the integration time τ, and therefore there are Bτ independent
pulses. These independent contributions are largely canceled by each other over this
period, and thus the system noise contribution is reduced by Bτ.

The sensitivity or the minimum detectable signal ΔTmin is defined as ΔT, which
produces the output Ws equal to Wsys. Thus we have
ΔTmin =

,
(17.48)
where Ks is the sensitivity constant of the order of unity. For example, Ks = 1 for the
total power receiver and Ks = π∕
√
2 for a Dick receiver.
The total power receiver is affected by the variation of the system gain ΔG/G.
The Dick receiver switches at a constant rate between the receiving antenna and a
reference load, thus canceling out gain instability (Kraus, 1966, Chapter 7; Skolnik,
1970).
17.8
RADAR RANGE EQUATION
When the noise temperature is included in a radar equation, there is a maximum range
in which a radar can detect a target. Radar equations give the received power Pr for
a given transmitted power Pt (see Section 10.2)

(17.49)
The system noise power Pn for the system with temperature Tsys and bandwidth B is
given by
Pn = KTsysB.

The signal-to-noise ratio is therefore
S
N = Pr
Pn
.
(17.51)
We therefore obtain the minimum detectable value of Pr
Pr = KTsys B S
N .
(17.52)
Substituting this into (17.49), we get the maximum range in which the radar can
detect a target in terms of S/N, Tsys, and B. If the output can be integrated over the
time τ, the system temperature is effectively reduced to Tsys/(Bτ)1/2.

APERTURE ILLUMINATION AND BRIGHTNESS
DISTRIBUTIONS
In visible wavelengths, the atmosphere is transparent, and in wavelengths between
1 cm and 100 m the atmosphere is again transparent. For wavelengths longer than
about 10 m, radio waves may not penetrate the ionosphere. Between 1 cm and
around 10 μm, there are a considerable number of molecular absorptions. Also
for wavelengths shorter than 0.1 μm, there is considerable molecular absorption.
Therefore, we have optical windows and radio windows through the atmosphere.
Radio astronomy makes use of this radio window, whereas optical astronomy makes
use of the optical window (see Kraus, 1966).
Let us consider a radio telescope pointed to the sky (Fig. 17.11). The aperture
field distribution is given by A(x, y) and the radiation pattern g(θ, ϕ) is related to the
aperture distribution through a Fourier transform (see Section 9.5)
g (θ, ϕ) = ∫A (x, y)e𝑖kxx+jkyy dx dy,

We now consider the antenna beam scanning the sky in the x–z plane (y = 0, ϕ = 0).
Letting g(θ, 0) = g(β) and ∫A(x, y) dy = A(x), we rewrite (17.53):
g(β) = ∫A(x)ejβxdx,
(17.54)
where β = k sin θ.
Next we consider the power pattern p(β), which is given by
p (β) = g (β)g∗(β)
= ∫∫A (x)A∗(x′)ejβ(x−x′) dx dx′.
(17.55)
The Fourier transform of the power pattern P(x′′) is then given by
P (x′′) = 1
2π ∫p (β)e−jβx′′dβ
= ∫A (x)A∗(x −x′′) dx.
(17.56)
This is a convolution integral of the aperture distribution. These relationships are
expressed conveniently in Fig. 17.12.
Next we let the antenna beam be pointed to the direction θ0 and let the beam scan
the sky with brightness distribution B(θ) = B(β). This scanning is often accomplished
by the rotation of the earth. The output S(β0) then depends on the scanning angle θ0
and thus (Fig. 17.13)
S(β0) = ∫B(β)p(β0 −β)dβ,
β0 = k sin θ0.

spectrum of the brightness distribution is filtered by the antenna pattern and produces
the output.

TWO-ANTENNA INTERFEROMETER
As an example of the use of the relationships shown in Section 17.9, we consider a

2 [1 + V (β0, a)],
(17.61)
where
S0 = ∫B (β) dβ,
V(β0, a) = 1
S0 ∫B(β) cos[(β0 −β)a] dβ.
Now we consider the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution B(β)
Vc(a) = 1
S0 ∫B (β)e−jβa dβ.
(17.62)
This function Vc(a) is called the complex visibility function and is the normalized
correlation function of the wave at the receiver as a function of the separation a.
When the separation a is zero, Vc is unity, and as the separation a increases, the
correlation decreases. The function Vc(a) is the normalized mutual coherence function
or degree of coherence. The Fourier transform relationship (17.62) between the source
brightness distribution of the incoherent source and the degree of coherence at the
observation point is a special case of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem when the source
and the observation point are far from each other (Born and Wolf, 1970, Chapter 10).

The complex visibility function Vc(a) can be expressed as
Vc (a) = V0 (a) e−jΔ(a).
(17.63)
Then the observed output S(β0) is given by
S (β0) = S0
2 {1 + V0(a) cos[β0a −Δ(a) ]},
(17.64)
where
V(β0, a) = Re[Vc(a)ejβ0a].
The observed output S(β0) as a function of the scan angle β0 is sketched in Fig. 17.15.
In radio astronomy, the scanning is accomplished by the rotation of the earth.
It is now possible to determine the complex visibility function from measurement
of the observed output S(β0). The maximum and minimum values of S(β0) are given
by
Smax = S0
2 [1 + V0(a)],
Smin = S0
2 [1 −V0(a)].
(17.65)
From this we get
V0(a) = Smax −Smin
Smax + Smin
.
(17.66)
This magnitude V0(a) is called the fringe visibility or visibility. Also at β0 = 0, we get
V (0, a) = V0 (a) cos Δ (a) .
(17.67)

PROBLEMS
607
From (17.66) and (17.67) we get V0(a) and Δ(a), and thus Vc(a). Once we get Vc(a)
for all separations a, it should be possible to obtain the brightness distribution B(β)
by the inverse Fourier transform of (17.62).
The Fourier transform relationship (17.62) can be generalized to two dimensions
as indicated in (17.53). The technique of measuring the complex visibility function
and then obtaining the map of the brightness distribution of the radio sources in the
sky is called the aperture synthesis. To obtain the complex visibility function, the
measurement must be made at a sufficient number of separations. The Very Large
Array (VLA) constructed in New Mexico can have a separation up to 35 km for
frequencies ranging from 1.4 to 24 GHz.

CHAPTER 18
STOCHASTIC WAVE THEORIES
Many of the problems we deal with can be classified as either “deterministic” or
“random.” For most of the problems in this book, we deal with media and objects that
are well defined in shape, positions, and material characteristics such as dielectric
constant, and we determine the field quantities such as electric and magnetic fields
and the Poynting vectors for various applications. These are called “deterministic”
problems. In contrast, there are many cases where the media characteristics, positions,
and shape may vary randomly in space and time. Examples include most geophysical
and biological media. They are called “random media,” and the waves propagating
in the random media vary randomly in space and time. It must be noted, however,
that even though the medium and the waves vary randomly, there are well-defined
theories underlining the random phenomena. Statistical wave theories are therefore
aimed at discovering and making use of these well-defined theories governing random
phenomena.
We discussed many examples and applications of statistical wave theories in
several chapters and therefore we do not duplicate those discussions here. Rather, in
this chapter, we present a summary of the historical development of these theories
and new ideas, and key questions that may be outstanding or may need further
attention.

STOCHASTIC WAVE THEORIES
18.1
STOCHASTIC WAVE EQUATIONS AND STATISTICAL
WAVE THEORIES
Random media include characteristics that are continuous random functions of space
and time, such as the dielectric constant, and can therefore be considered as a random
continuum. An example is turbulence in the atmosphere, ionosphere, or troposphere,
ocean turbulence, interplanetary and interstellar turbulence, and heterogeneous earth
(Keller, 1964). Random media also include the random boundary surfaces that are
a continuous random function of space and time, such as ocean surfaces. Random
media can also be considered as a random distribution of discrete scatterers such as
rain, fog, snow, and ice particles. This also includes a diffuse medium such as tissues
and blood cells (Twersky, 1964).
Waves in random media are governed by stochastic wave equations. Solutions are
usually sought for statistical averages and statistical moments of the fields. Therefore,
“stochastic wave theories” can also be called “statistical wave theories.”
18.2
SCATTERING IN TROPOSPHERE, IONOSPHERE, AND
ATMOSPHERIC OPTICS
Early studies of radio wave scattering in the troposphere were conducted by Booker
and Gordon (1950), who made use of the exponential correlation function for refrac-
tive index fluctuations giving relationships among the angular dependence, correlation
distance, and wavelength. The results are related to the Bragg diffraction and are well
known (Ishimaru, 1997). Other spectra such as the Gaussian model and modified
Kolmogorov model have been studied and applied to scattering in the troposphere, in
the planetary atmosphere, and the solar wind. Scattering by ionospheric turbulence has
been studied extensively, including the dispersion, the scintillation index, the double-
passage effects, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging through the ionosphere
(Jin, 2004; Rino, 2011; Tatarskii et al., 1992; Yeh and Lin, 1992). Atmospheric optics
has been investigated extensively (Tatarskii, 1961, 1971). In particular, studies have
included backscattering enhancement, the fourth-order moments, speckles, localiza-
tion, tissue optics, imaging through turbulence, and adaptive optics (Ishimaru, 1997).
Also noted are “thin screen” and “extended Huygen–Fresnel” techniques. The “path-
integral” approach has been applied by Tatarskii and others (1993). Also noted are
Useinski’s fundamental solutions and two-scale solutions (Tatarskii, 1993).
One of the important problems is the pulse propagation through random media.
This requires the study of a two-frequency mutual coherence function (MCF) for
random media, and several techniques are proposed (Ishimaru, 1997).
18.3
TURBID MEDIUM, RADIATIVE TRANSFER, AND RECIPROCITY
We have already discussed (and will further discuss) radiative transfer theory and
their applications in Chapters 17, 19, 20, and 24. Early work on radiative transfer
www.ebook3000.com

STOCHASTIC SOMMERFELD PROBLEM, SEISMIC CODA, AND SUBSURFACE IMAGING
613
was done by Schuster (1905) to study radiation through a foggy atmosphere. The
definitive work was reported by Chandrasekhar (1950) to study the transport and
scattering of radiation in planetary and stellar atmospheres. The equation of transfer
is equivalent to Boltzmann’s equation used in the diffusion of neutrons. The radiative
transfer theory is also used in scattering in geophysical media and in biological media
(Chapters 19 and 20).
The fundamental equations for waves in multiple scattering diffuse media are the
Dyson equations for the first moment and Bethe–Salpeter equations for the second
moment. This is discussed in detail in Section 24.4. Here we discuss the reciprocity
relations for the radiative transfer. Green’s function G(rsr𝑖) is the field at rs when the
point source is at r𝑖. Because of the reciprocity, we have
G(rsr𝑖) = G(r𝑖rs).
(18.1)
The intensity Green’s function L is given by
L
(
rsr𝑖r′
sr′
𝑖
)
=
⟨
G(rsr𝑖)G∗(
r′
sr′
𝑖
)⟩
.
(18.2)
Now consider the following four cases:
L1 = ⟨G(rsr𝑖)G∗(r′
sr′
𝑖
)⟩,
L2 = ⟨G(r𝑖rs)G∗(r′
𝑖r′
s
)⟩,
L3 = ⟨G(rsr𝑖)G∗(r′
𝑖r′
s
)⟩,
L4 = ⟨G(r𝑖rs)G∗(r′
sr′
𝑖
)⟩.
(18.3)
Without the statistical average, these four are the same. However, we need to con-
sider the interference. L1 and L2 correspond to interchanging the source and obser-
vation points and they are equal, and this shows the reciprocity of radiative transfer
(Fig. 18.1). However, L3 is exactly the same as L1 only if this is exact backscatter-
ing and the forward and the time-reversed counter propagating path are the same.
Therefore at the exact backscattering, the intensity becomes L1 + L3 = 2L. Away
from the exact backscattering, the interference destroys the magnitude of L3, leaving
a sharp peak with the angular width of λ∕ltr, where ltr = transport mean free path
(Fig. 18.2).
18.4
STOCHASTIC SOMMERFELD PROBLEM, SEISMIC CODA,
AND SUBSURFACE IMAGING
In Chapter 15, we discussed radiation from a dipole on the conducting earth. These are
related problems that deal with wave excitation and propagation over earth’s surface.
Examples are rough surface scattering in Chapter 23, and seismic acoustic pulse
scattering and propagation over the heterogeneous earth and the wave train called

the “coda.” They are different problems, but can be examined from more unified and
broad viewpoints.
The Sommerfeld problem deals with radio waves over a flat earth. However, if we
consider imaging of objects near the ocean surface or terrain, it may be necessary to
study the effects of roughness of the surface. This is a study of “stochastic Green’s
function” for rough surfaces. This problem has been studied using Dyson and Bethe–
Salpeter equations for coherent and incoherent fields using the smoothed diagram
method (Ishimaru et al., 2000) similar to Watson–Keller studies (1984). Sommerfeld
and Zenneck waves, and the effects of rough surfaces on the Sommerfeld pole can
be found in Ishimaru et al. (2000). These studies, however, are not complete as
they deal with one-dimensional rough surfaces, and small root mean square heights.
Seismic pulse excitation for a flat earth surface has been studied extensively (de

Hoop, 1985). However, recent studies are directed to the study of the effects of
random heterogeneous earth, which gives the wave trains called the “coda.” The
characteristics of the coda have been studied, but most of the studies assume the
medium extending to all directions in three dimensions, and the rough surface effects
of the boundary between air and the earth are not included (Sato et al., 2012, Chapter
26). The earth–air boundary has been included in the pulse over a flat earth surface.
However, we are interested in the heterogeneous earth, which gives the seismic
coda. It may, therefore, be useful to consider the excitation and propagation of the
seismic pulse in the heterogeneous earth with a flat air–earth boundary. The boundary
conditions at the air–earth boundary are given in Appendix 26 (Eq. 26.A.9) where
normal stress and tangential stress are zero. Using the space–time Fourier transform,
the formal solutions can be obtained. It is necessary to calculate both coherent and
incoherent waves. The Fourier transform includes the pole due to the Rayleigh surface
wave and the reflection at the air–earth boundary with P-wave and S-wave incident
waves. This study has not been fully explored and reported. There have been recent
studies indicating that deep subsurface roughness on plasmonic thin film can create
evanescent waves which make it possible to enhance subwavelength imaging (Tsang
et al., 2015).
18.5
STOCHASTIC GREEN’S FUNCTION AND STOCHASTIC
BOUNDARY PROBLEMS
Green’s function is well known among students of electrical engineering. George
Green was born a son of a baker in Nottingham. He had limited education. His
first published work in 1828 contained Green’s function, Green’s theorem, and other
mathematical tools that became the essential link between classical field theory and
quantum electrodynamics of Schwinger, Feynman, Tomonaga, the Feynman diagram,
Dyson and Bethe–Salpeter equations, and the physics of condensed matter (Dyson,
1993). Green’s function G(r, t, r′, t′) describes the response of the field at a given
point r at a later time t due to an impulse excitation (delta function) of the field
at another given point r′ at an earlier time t′. Here we briefly summarize basic
formulations.
For a time-harmonic deterministic problem in free space, the scalar Green’s func-
tion is given by
G(r, r′) = exp(𝑖k0r)
4πr
,
(18.4)
where k0 is the free space wave number.
If the medium is random with relative dielectric constant ε = ⟨ε⟩(1 + ε′), where
⟨ε⟩is the average dielectric constant and ε′ is its fluctuation, Green’s function is
a random function of space and time. Therefore we need to consider the average

616
STOCHASTIC WAVE THEORIES
and the fluctuating Green’s function. We have the first moment and the second
moment.
⟨G⟩= first moment,
⟨
G(r1)G∗(r2)
⟩
= second moment.
(18.5)
The first moment is the average or the coherent Green’s function. The fluctuating
Green’s function (also called the incoherent Green’s function) can be written as
Gf = G −⟨G⟩.
(18.6)
The second moment is called the MCF.
Γ(r1, r2) = ⟨G(r1)G∗(r2)⟩= |⟨G⟩|2 + ⟨Gf (r1)G∗
f (r2)⟩.
(18.7)
Our task is therefore finding the first and second moments, including the boundary
conditions and the object characteristics for imaging, communications, and other
applications. As an example, consider a point target (Fig. 18.3). G1G2 are forward
and backward waves and G3G4 are their conjugates. The received field is G1G2 and
the received power is (G1G2)(G∗
3G∗
4). Each Green’s function consists of the average
⟨G𝑖⟩and the fluctuation v𝑖, 𝑖= 1, 2, 3, and 4. We now look at the received power Pr.
Pr = ⟨(G1G2)(G∗
3G∗
4
)⟩
= ⟨(G1 + v1)(G2 + v2)(G3 + v3)∗(G4 + v4)∗⟩.

STOCHASTIC GREEN’S FUNCTION AND STOCHASTIC BOUNDARY PROBLEMS
617
This is the fourth-order moment. We now make an assumption that the random
Green’s functions are circular complex Gaussian random variables (Appendix 23.A).
From this, we obtain
Pr = ⟨G1⟩⟨G∗
3
⟩⟨G2⟩⟨G∗

(18.9)
From this, noting G1 = G2 and G3 = G4, v1 = v2 and v3 = v4, we get
Pr = [⟨G1⟩⟨G∗
3
⟩]2 + 4⟨G1⟩⟨G∗
3
⟩⟨v1v∗
3
⟩+ 2⟨v1v∗

(18.10)
Note that this includes the correlation between the forward and backward waves. If
we ignore this correlation, we get
Pr = ⟨G1⟩⟨G∗
3
⟩2 + 2⟨G1⟩⟨G∗
3
⟩⟨v1v∗
3
⟩+ ⟨v1v∗
3
⟩2
(18.11)
The difference between (18.10) and (18.11) clearly shows the effects of the cor-
relation between the forward and backward waves. This effect equals the increase
of the backscattered power shown in (18.10) because of the correlation, over that
in (18.11) if we ignore the correlation. This is an indication of the double-passage
effect.
Let us next look at an example of stochastic integral equations. Consider a target
in a random medium (Fig. 18.4). We take a simple case that the boundary condition
Gi

618
STOCHASTIC WAVE THEORIES
of the surface of the target is the Dirichlet type. This is given in Section 12.1. We
write the surface integral equation
G𝑖(r, r0) = ∫S
G(̄r, ̄r′)J(̄r′)ds′,
(18.12)
where J(̄r′) = ∂ψ(r′)
∂n
is equivalent to the surface current, G is Green’s function, and
G𝑖is the incident Green’s function originating at r0 and observed at r. Here we are
assuming that the incident wave G𝑖is excited by a delta function at r = r0.
The scattered field ψs(r′) is then given by
ψs(r′) = −∫S
G(̄r, ̄r′)J(̄r′)ds′
(18.13)
Note that when r is on the surface at r = rs, we have
ψ𝑖(rs) + ψs(rs) = 0,
(18.14)
satisfying the Dirichlet boundary conditions.
The target is in a random medium and therefore G𝑖, ψs, G, and J are all random
functions. Let us first consider the first moment.
⟨G𝑖⟩= ∫
⟨G(rr′)J(r∗)⟩ds′.
(18.15)
The incident wave ⟨G1⟩can be calculated if we know the random medium
characteristics.
Let us write J, unknown current, as
J(r′) = ∫S
S(r′, r′′)ψ𝑖(r′′)ds′′.
(18.16)
The function S is called the “transition operator” or the “scattering operator” (Frisch,
1968). It is also called the “current generator” (Meng-Tateiba, 1996). The integral
equation (18.12) is then written as
G𝑖(r, r0) = ∫S
ds′
∫S
ds′′G(r, r′)S(r, r′)G𝑖(r′′, r0).
(18.17)
The scattered field (18.13) is given by
ψs = −∫S
ds′G(rr′) ∫S
ds′′S(r′r′′)ψ𝑖(r′′).
(18.18)

The second moment of the backscattered wave at r = r0 is then given by

(18.19)
Note that S is a random function. However, this is the current at r′ produced by the
field at r′′ and therefore it may be possible to assume that to calculate S, the medium
surrounding the surface has the average dielectric constant. Under this assumption,
we can approximate S by a deterministic average value ⟨S⟩.
We then get
⟨|Gs|2⟩= ds′′

are complex circular Gaussian variables (Appendix 23.A).
We then write

(18.21)
These second-order moments have been calculated and therefore the radar cross
section can be calculated from ⟨|Gs|2⟩.

CHANNEL CAPACITY OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WITH
RANDOM MEDIA MUTUAL COHERENCE FUNCTION
Channel capacities of communications through various environments have been
extensively studied. The channel transfer matrix H is often assumed to have the
elements that are zero mean circularly complex Gaussian random variable (Paulraj
et al., 2003). On the other hand, the propagation through random media has been
extensively studied and MCF has been calculated for various random media envi-
ronments. This section shows the relationship between the channel capacity and the
MCF.
Consider a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) propagation channel with M
transmitters and N receivers. The output y (N × 1 matrix), the input x (M × 1 matrix),
and the noise N (N × N) are written in the conventional model (Chizhik et al., 2002;
Ishimaru et al., 2010; Paulraj et al., 2003).
y = Hx + N.
(18.22)
H(N × M) is the channel transfer matrix normalized as
Tr⟨HH′⟩= MN,
(18.23)
where H′ is the conjugate transpose of H.

.
(18.24)
PSR is the signal-to-noise ratio and λ𝑖are the eigenvalues (or the singular values)
of HH′.
Let us now look at the key idea of this section: how to express H using MCF. H
is the transfer matrix from n receivers to m transmitters. Therefore its element Hnm
is proportional to the stochastic Green’s function from the transmitter at rm to the
receiver at rn.
Hnm ∝Gnm.

From this we obtain

that the figure shows possible diffraction effects including keyhole (Chizhik et al.,
2002).
Normalization of H is done by choosing the constant in front of (18.26) such that

INTEGRATION OF STATISTICAL WAVES WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES
621
With the above formulation, it is now possible to calculate the channel capacity
(Eq. 18.24) once we calculate the MCF in (18.26). Note that this applies to any
random medium and diffracting walls or keyholes since the formulation is based on
the statistical Green’s function and MCF, which may be obtained in many situations.
The general formulation given in this section has been used to calculate the channel
capacity of MIMO model in a random medium including 60 GHz 500 m link in rain
(Ishimaru, 2010).
18.7
INTEGRATION OF STATISTICAL WAVES WITH
OTHER DISCIPLINES
Stochastic wave theories have been developed over many years and are now estab-
lished as an important discipline. However, it is important to keep in mind that while
statistical wave theories can be viewed as separate from many other deterministic
problems, integration of statistical wave theories with other physical disciplines has
been recognized as an important area of research and applications. In this section, we
give and highlight some examples of this integration.
(1) Statistical Signal Processing
In Section 18.6, we discussed one of the examples of the inclusion of statistical
wave theory in a communication problem. A key in the problem is how to
express the channel transfer function H for communication through random
media. As stated in Section 18.6, the transfer function H can be given by a
stochastic Green’s function in random media. In Section 18.6, we expressed
H in terms of the stochastic Green’s function in homogenous random media.
However, this can be generalized to include the effects of keyhole or any
diffraction effects as indicated there. This problem of communication in media
that includes random media and deterministic objects including statistical
signal processing has not been fully investigated.
(2) Heat Transfer and Multi-Physics
If a wave propagates through a random medium and is incident on an object,
the wave energy may be absorbed by the object and transformed to heat energy,
which will diffuse in the medium creating time and space variations of the
temperature distribution. We discuss this in Section 20.2. This is also one
of the examples of “multi-physics” problems, which deals with simultaneous
phenomena of more than one physical model. In this case, we are dealing with
electromagnetics and temperature diffusion equations.
(3) Seismic Fluctuations and Coda, Acoustic-Electromagnetic Interaction
In chapter 26, we discuss the problem of seismic coda, which is the fluctuation
of acoustic waves in random heterogeneous solid earth, including Rayleigh
surface waves. Here, it is important to understand the basic theories and formu-
lations of acoustic waves in solids. This is also applicable to electromagnetic
excitation of acoustic waves in a solid (Sarabandi, 2003).

622
STOCHASTIC WAVE THEORIES
(4) Porous Medium and Mixtures
In Section 8.6, we discussed the use of the “mixing formula” to determine the
effective dielectric constant of a mixture of two or more materials with different
dielectric constants. A mixture can also be treated as a porous medium, where
the pore and porosity, and the relation to the fractional volume, are the concepts
of interest. It is also related to “percolation theory.” It may be noted that for
a porous medium such as shale, the production of oil depends on whether the
porosity is greater than or smaller than the critical porosity. Further discussion
of the porous medium is given in Chapter 26.
(5) Quantum Electromagnetics, Casimir Force, and Graphene
This book is based on classical electromagnetics; quantum electrodynamics
is outside the scope of this book. However, recently numerical classical elec-
tromagnetics have been used to calculate the Casimir force, which may be
potentially useful for microelectromagnetic systems (MEMS) and nanoelec-
tromagnetic systems (NEMS). The Casimir force was predicted by Casimir
in 1948. It exists among charge-neutral bodies due to the quantum fluctua-
tions of electromagnetic fields in vacuum. The force is extremely small, but
it becomes significant between charge-neutral objects when the separation is
below microns. (Xiong, Tong, Atkins, and Chew 2010) (Atkins, Chew et al.,
2014). Computational electromagnetic techniques have been used to calculate
Casimir forces.
Graphene is a monolayer of carbon atoms packed into a dense honeycomb
crystal structure. It was discovered by Geim and Novoselov in 2004, and they
were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010. Graphene has attracted
much attention because at present it is considered the strongest component,
the best conductor of heat, the best conductor of electricity, and has strong
broadband absorption characteristics. Its many potential applications include
solar cells, broadband THz absorbers, plasmic antennas, cloaking, and many
others (Chen and Alu, 2011, 2013; Novoselov and Geim et al., 2005; Sailing
He, 2013; Yao et al., 2013).
18.8
SOME ACCOUNTS OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF
STATISTICAL WAVE THEORIES
The history of statistical wave theories is rooted over a hundred years. In this section,
we outline some key developments.
(a) Random Continuum
Early work on microwave scattering by tropospheric turbulence includes
the Booker–Gordon formula (1950), scattering of ionospheric turbulence
(Yeh-Liu, 1972), atmospheric optics (Tatarski, 1961, 1971), and astrophysics
wave scintillations in solar wind, planetary atmosphere, and pulsar scintilla-
tions. Fundamental to these studies are the “Dyson equation” for coherent

SOME ACCOUNTS OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF STATISTICAL WAVE THEORIES
623
waves and the “Bethe–Salpeter” equation for incoherent wave correlations.
These equations can be expressed using a Feynman diagram. In fact, the field
of statistical wave theory has benefited from the studies of stochastic Green’s
functions and MCFs in astrophysics.
(b) Turbid Medium
Closely related to the work on waves in a random continuum is the early
work on the propagation of radiation in a foggy atmosphere (Schuster, 1905).
Radiative transfer theory (Chandrasekhar, 1950) has been extensively used
to describe waves in fog, rain, snow, and terrain. Radiative transfer has been
applied extensively to geophysical remote sensing and scattering. It has been
used in biomedical tissue optics, imaging, and ultrasound imaging of tissues.
Basic formulations of radiative transfer are closely related to neutron transport
and Boltzmann’s transport equation.
(c) Partially Coherent Waves
There were considerable studies made on partially coherent waves, which are
not strictly monochromatic in space and time and polarizations. Born and
Wolf in Principle of Optics (1964) discussed in detail coherence time, degree
of coherence, the MCF, and interference. In fact, when we talk about the
coherent and the incoherent field, we need to keep in mind that the incoherent
field is actually a partially coherent field and much of the study of partially
coherent waves applies to the waves in random media.
(d) Rough Surface and Rough Interface Scattering
Research on scattering by a rough surface dates back to Rayleigh (1898), who
conducted a study of scattering by a sinusoidal corrugated surface based on
what is now called the Rayleigh hypothesis, which assumes that the scattered
wave within the corrugation is expressed by the outgoing wave only. This
hypothesis has been proved correct if the maximum slope is less than 0.448.
Further studies have been reported by Rice (1951) and others, as shown in
Chapter 23.
(e) Enhanced Backscattering and Memory Effects
In Chapter 24, we discuss enhanced backscattering and memory effects. Both
represent the coherence effects in multiple scattering.

CHAPTER 19
GEOPHYSICAL REMOTE SENSING
AND IMAGING
Geophysical remote sensing and imaging is a key engineering discipline dealing with
the remote sensing of the earth, oceans, atmosphere, and space. It covers vast areas as
represented by the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) of IEEE (Ulaby
et al., 1981; Tsang and Kong, 2001). Remote sensing of the earth’s environment is
one of the important societal needs. Satellite or aircraft observations of geophysical
media, the atmosphere, and the ocean give useful information on our environment.
In this chapter, we discuss several techniques and applications of remote sensing and
imaging. Active radar technologies make use of the transmitted radar signals and
the waves scattered by the geophysical media. Passive sensors detect the thermal
radiation emitted by the geophysical media. We can also make use of the active and
passive sensors to detect and image objects hidden in the geophysical environment.
In both active and passive sensors, we can measure the amplitude or the intensity
of the received signal. More recently, however, the polarization characteristics and
the space–time correlations have been measured and processed to give more com-
plete information on the environment and objects. In this chapter, we emphasize
selected topics. First, we review polarimetric radars as applied to the decomposition
theorem, which helps to obtain medium characteristics from radar backscattering.
Nonspherical particles and differential reflectivity and general eigenvalue formula-
tions of nonspherical scattering are discussed next. More fundamental formulations
of space–time vector radiative transfer and Wigner distributions are presented. Pas-
sive radars are discussed in relation to polarization and ocean wind directions. We
discuss the inclusion of antenna temperature in the van Cittert–Zernike theorem. The

final section covers ionospheric dispersion and Faraday rotation effects on synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) images.
19.1
POLARIMETRIC RADAR
In Section 16.7, we discussed radar polarimetry for a single target including the com-
plex effective height of the antennas and the matched impedance and polarization.
In Section 16.8, we discussed the optimum polarization and its relation to the eigen-
value problem. We then presented the Stokes vector radar equation and polarization
signature in Section 16.9. In this section, we discuss the fundamentals of polarimetric
radar, including the decomposition of target scattering matrices to extract physical
information about the target.
It was noted in early 1950s that it was necessary to include the polarization char-
acteristics in the transmission and reception (Sinclair, 1950). This was followed by
extensive research conducted by Kennaugh and Huynen (1978) and Boerner (1983)
pointing out that new information on targets can be obtained through the use of the
vector nature of electromagnetic waves, the scattering matrix, the Mueller matrix,
and the coherency matrix. Cloude (1985), Kostinski and Boerner (1986), Cloude and
Pottier (1996), and Cloude (2009) performed pioneering and comprehensive work on
target decomposition theorems, which show the decomposition of the scattering or
the Mueller matrix into a sum of a set of matrices representing the physical basis for
each component. Expanding the 2 × 2 scattering matrix in terms of Pauli matrices is
one example of the decomposition. The polarization information can be displayed in
the form of polarization signature, showing different signatures identified for different
physical objects (van Zyl et al., 1987; Zebker et al., 1991). Comprehensive reviews
were given by Zebker et al. (1991). Freeman and Durden (1998) developed a scat-
tering model which gives a physically based three-component scattering mechanism
of canopy layer, double bounce, and rough surface scattering. A tutorial introduction
of radar polarimetry was given by Luneburg (1995), and Boerner (2003) described
recent advances in radar polarimetry and radar interferometry in synthetic aperture
remote sensing. The three-component model by Freeman and Durden was extended
to the four-component model by Yamaguchi et al. (2005) with the addition of helix
scattering. Lopez-Martinez, Pottier, and Cloude (2005) discussed the target decom-
position theorems based on the eigenvector decomposition with the entropy H, the
anisotropy A, and the α and β angles. A review of radar polarimetry and polarimet-
ric SAR was given by Boerner (2003). Arii, van Zyl, and Kim (2010) presented a
generalization of the scattering from a vegetation canopy and adaptive model-based
decomposition techniques. In this section, we give an introduction to the fundamental
theory of radar polarimetry.
19.1.1
Coordinate System
In discussing the scattering matrix of geophysical media, it is necessary to define
two coordinate systems commonly used in polarimetry. Consider bistatic scattering

Bistatic scattering. (a) FSA (forward scattering alignment). (b) BSA (back-

Note: ̄E1𝑖× ̄E2𝑖is pointed in the direction ̂𝑖and ̄E1s × ̄E2s is pointed in the direction ̂o. If ̄E1s is
the same for both FSA and BSA, ̄E2s(BSA) = −̄E2s(FSA).
shown in Fig. 19.1. For forward scattering alignment (FSA), the wave is incident
on a scatterer or a surface in a direction ̂𝑖and the scattered wave in a direction ̂o
is received by a receiving antenna. For backward scattering alignment (BSA), the
scattered wave ( ̄E1s, ̄E2s) is expressed such that ( ̄E1s × ̄E2s) is pointed toward the
scatterer. The advantage of BSA is that, for backscattering, the same basis can be
used for both incident ̂𝑖and scattered ̂o waves. For most geophysical imaging, BSA
is commonly used because of this advantage. However, FSA is commonly used in
most other applications. In particular, FSA is used for vector radiative transfer, as is
shown in Section 19.6. In this section, we use the BSA formulation.
19.1.2
Scattering Matrix [S] and Mueller Matrix [M]
As we discussed in Section 16.7, the scattered wave ̄Es can be expressed by (16.80).
[ ̄Es] = e𝑖kR2
R2
[F][ ̄Et].
(19.1)
In geophysical remote sensing, it is common to use the scattering matrix [S] instead
of the scattering amplitude matrix [F].
[ ̄Es] = e𝑖kR2

In geophysical applications, we often use the horizontal and vertical polarizations.

[S] =

(19.3)
h′ and v′ represent the horizontal and vertical components of a scattered wave and h
and v represent the horizontal and vertical components of the incident wave. Note that
here we used BSA, and as it is commonly used in many remote sensing applications,
we used the time dependence exp(−𝑖ωt) rather than IEEE convention of exp(jωt).
It has already been noted in Section 10.10 that the Stokes parameters (I1s, I2s, US,
and Vs) of the scattered waves are related to the Stokes parameters (I1𝑖, I2𝑖, U𝑖, and
V𝑖) of the incident wave by the 4 × 4 Mueller matrix [M] (Ishimaru, 1997).

(19.5)
For bistatic scattering, there are only seven independent parameters in [S], with four
amplitude and three phases, excluding the absolute phase. In the monostatic case,
S12 = S21 because of the reciprocity and therefore there are only five independent

parameters. There are 16 elements in the Mueller matrix. However since only seven
independent parameters are in the scattering matrix and the Mueller matrix is equiv-
alent to the scattering matrix, there are 9 (=16 −7) relations among 16 Mueller
elements. In the monostatic case, [M] has 10 parameters. Since there are only 5 inde-
pendent parameters, there are 5 (=10 −5) relations among Mueller elements. The
above are for deterministic scatterers.
In most geophysical media, all the elements in the scattering and Mueller matrices
are random and therefore it is necessary to take statistical averages. It is then noted
that the average of the element of [S] represents the coherent field, which may become
negligible for many applications, while the average of the element of [M] represents
the intensity and the correlations. This clearly shows that the Mueller matrix is
essential in geophysical remote sensing.
19.1.3
Decomposition of Scattering Matrix and Pauli Matrices
The 2 × 2 target scattering matrix [S] contains information about the target. There
are several ways to extract physical information from [S]. One is the use of the Pauli
matrices. It is known that any 2 × 2 matrix can be expressed as a linear sum of four
basic matrices consisting of the unit matrix [σ0] and three Pauli spin matrices [σ1],
[σ2], and [σ3] (Cloude and Pottier, 1996; Goldstein, 1981).
[S] = eo[σ0] + e1[σ1] + e2[σ2] + e3[σ3],
(19.6)
where e0, e1, e2, and e3 are complex constants and
[σ0] =
( 1

)
, [σ1] =
(0

)
,
[σ2] =
( 0

)
, [σ3] =
(1

)
.
(19.7)
These matrices σ𝑖(𝑖= 0, 1, 2, 3) are independent and σ1, σ2, and σ3 have zero traces
(the sum of the diagonal elements). Note that
Tr(e𝑖) = 0, 𝑖= 1, 2, 3,
Tr(σ𝑖σj) = 0, 𝑖≠j,
σ𝑖σ𝑖= unit matrix = σ0, 𝑖= 1, 2, 3.
(19.8)
Using these, we can obtain all the coefficients e𝑖in (19.6) by the following.
e𝑖= 1
2Tr([S][σ𝑖]).
(19.9)
Note that the decomposition (19.6) is not unique and there are many other ways of
decomposition. The process of decomposing the scattering matrix [S] as shown in
www.ebook3000.com

630
GEOPHYSICAL REMOTE SENSING AND IMAGING
(19.6) with (19.7) is one of several examples of “target decomposition theorem.”
This theorem is developed showing that the scattering matrix is a sum of independent
elements to associate a physical mechanism and meaning with each element, as
discussed by Cloude and Pottier (1996).
Let us discuss the physical interpretation of the basis matrices [σ𝑖] and their
physical mechanisms (Boerner et al., 1981). [σ0] represents simple scattering from
a plane surface or a sphere. [σ3] represents the scattering by a 90 corner reflector
(trough) and [σ1] is the same as [σ2] except that the axis is rotated by 45. [σ2]
represents scattering by helix. For example,
[σ+] = [σ3] + [σ2][σ3] =

19.2
SCATTERING MODELS FOR GEOPHYSICAL MEDIUM AND
DECOMPOSITION THEOREM
Observations of polarimetric scattering by a geophysical medium reveal scattering
mechanisms and physical characteristics of the medium. The backscattering from a
forest, trees, ground roughness, dielectric constant, and terrain can be obtained from
the medium characteristics and this is called the “forward problem.” The “inverse”
of this process to find a medium characteristic from radar backscattering is called
the “decomposition” of the observed scattering matrix. These methods are known
as the “target decomposition theorem” and comprehensive reviews have been given
(Cloude and Pottier, 1996). In this section, we outline the three-component model by
Freeman and Durden (1998) and the eigenvector-based composition.
19.2.1
Three-Component Scattering Model
In 1998, Freeman and Durden developed a method based on a combination of three
simple scattering mechanisms. They are (1) the canopy layer model, (2) the double-
bounce model, and (3) the rough surface model, illustrated in Fig. 19.2. The scattering
matrix [S] is given by
[S] =
[ Svv
Svh
Shv
Shh
]
.

Three scattering mechanisms. Top: canopy scatter, middle: double-bounce
scatter, bottom: rough surface scatter (Freeman and Darden, 1998).
Since scattering is due to multiple scattering, it is necessary to consider the second-
order moments, which can be written as
⟨|Shh|2⟩= fs |β|2 + fd |α|2 + fv,
⟨|Svv|2⟩= fs + fd + fv,
⟨ShhS∗

⟨|Shv|2⟩= fv(1∕3),
⟨ShhS∗
hv
⟩= ⟨ShvS∗
vv
⟩= 0,
(19.13)
where fs, fd, and fv are the surface, double-bounce, and volume (canopy) contributions.
The canopy contribution fv needs to include the random orientation of the scatter-
ers (branches) from the vertical, resulting in (1/3). The double-bounce contribution
includes the difference between the vertical and the horizontal polarization repre-
sented by α. The surface scattering includes β representing the difference between
the horizontal and the vertical polarization.
Extensive studies have been conducted to show the usefulness of this three-
component model (Freeman and Durden, 1998) and this has been extended to a
four-component model including helix scattering contributions (Yamaguchi et al.,
2005).
19.2.2
Target Decomposition Based on Eigenvectors
Cloude and Pottier (1996) gave a comprehensive review of three types of target
decomposition theorems.
www.ebook3000.com

632
GEOPHYSICAL REMOTE SENSING AND IMAGING
The first type is based on the Mueller matrix and Stokes vector including statis-
tical fluctuations, and coherent backscattering in multiple scattering. The second is
the decomposition proposed by Huynen (1970), and the third is eigenvector-based
decomposition.
For backscattering, the scattering matrix [S] consists of three elements, S11, S12,
and S22, which forms the target vector [k3L] = [S11,
√
2S12, S22]T where T denotes
the transpose.
√
2 is required to keep the total scattered power Tr(SS+) = |S11|2 +
|S22|2 + 2|S12|2 constant. The coherency matrix [T] is formed by
[T] = [k3L][k3L]∗T.
(19.14)
Cloude was the first to consider the decomposition based on the eigenvalues λ1, λ2,
and λ3 of [T]. He defined the target entropy H, which is a measure of randomness of
the scatterer, the anisotropy A, and the α angle. Different values of H, A, and α, can
be used to identify shallow water, rough surfaces, vegetated areas, forested areas, and
other geophysical characteristics. Extensive work with examples is shown by Cloude
and Pottier (1996).
19.3
POLARIMETRIC WEATHER RADAR
Weather radar is extensively used to determine rainfall rate, drop size distribution,
and other parameters (Bringi and Chandrasekar, 2001; Doviak and Zrnic, 1984).
This section presents an outline of fundamental ideas. Let us first consider the radar
radiating a short pulse into a region of precipitation (rainfall) (see Fig. 19.3). The radar
has a narrow beam with angular half-power beam width θb and the pulse duration
of To. This includes interferometric radar, planar and cylindrical phased arrays, and
disdrometer observations (Zhang, et al., 2006, 2007, and 2011). First, we assume
that the antenna is linearly polarized. The wave propagates through rain. In general,
raindrops may not be spherical, and the propagation constant depends on the antenna

polarization in relation to the geometric shapes of the raindrop. This propagation
effect will be discussed in Sections 19.4 and 19.5. In this section, we assume that the
raindrops are spherical and there is one propagation constant and no depolarization.
The radar equation for the problem shown in Fig. 19.3 is well known. The received
signal Pr is given by (Ishimaru, 1997, Eq. (5.35))

NONSPHERICAL RAINDROPS AND DIFFERENTIAL
REFLECTIVITY
In Section 19.3, the weather radar equation is formulated assuming spherical rain
droplets. The output can be used to determine the reflectivity factor Z and the
backscattering coefficient ηb using (19.21) and (19.23). However, the rain rate R
cannot be directly determined from Z. The differential reflectivity Zdr has been suc-
cessfully used to estimate the rainfall rate R (Seliga and Bringi, 1976). This is done

by making simultaneous measurements of horizontal and vertical reflectivities (ZH
and ZV) and deriving the differential reflectivity Zdr.

σbH and σbV are the backscattering cross sections of a single raindrop when the
incident wave is horizontally and vertically polarized. The rain rate R is given by
R = ∫
∞
0
v(D)V(D)n(D)dD,
(19.25)
where v(D) is the terminal velocity (m/s), V(D) is the volume of a single droplet,
and n(D) is the number of particles per unit volume having diameter between D and
D + dD. Here D is the diameter of a sphere whose volume is the same as the actual
particle. The rain rate R is normally given in mm/hr and ranges from 0.25 mm/hr
(drizzle), 10 mm/hr (moderate), 10–50 mm/hr (heavy rain), to >50 mm/hr (extremely
heavy rain). The backscattering cross sections σbH and σbV can be calculated using
the Rayleigh scattering (Section 10.6). For spheroidal raindrops with major and minor
axes oriented in the horizontal and vertical directions, we have (Section 10.6)

For drops smaller than 1 mm in diameter, the shapes are spherical. For larger
particles, the shape is approximated by oblate spheroids, which have been shown by
Pruppacher and Pitter (1971).
The size distribution n(D) of rain is well represented by the Gamma distribution
n(D) = N0Dm exp(−ΛD).

PROPAGATION CONSTANT IN RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED
NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES
In Section 19.4, we discussed scattering by nonspherical raindrops whose major and
minor axes are oriented in the horizontal and vertical directions (Fig. 19.5). In general,
however raindrops are canted with a mean canting angle of approximately 10 (Oguchi,
1983). The wave propagating in such randomly distributed nonspherical particles
consists of the coherent and the incoherent components. The coherent components
⟨E1⟩and ⟨E2⟩satisfy the following differential equation (Cheung and Ishimaru,
1982; Ishimaru and Cheung, 1980; Ishimaru and Yeh, 1984):

Coherent field ⟨E⟩is obtained by summing the contribution from −∞< x <

Equation (19.28) is obtained by summing contributions from a slab of particles
(Fig. 19.6). The integral equation for the coherent field ⟨E⟩is therefore given by
⟨E⟩= E𝑖n + ∫dv′ ⟨E(̄r′)⟩f(̂n ∙̂𝑖)e𝑖k|̄r−̄r′|

(19.30)
We apply (∇2 + k2) to both sides of (19.30) and obtain
(∇2 + k2) ⟨E⟩= 0

Let us consider the coherent field given by (19.28) for nonspherical particles. There
are two propagation constants γ1 and γ2 which are the eigenvalues of the matrix [M].
We let ⟨E⟩be exp(γs) and obtain the following:

(19.39)
where A1 and A2 are the eigenvectors for γ1 and γ2.
[M][A𝑖] = γ𝑖[A𝑖],
𝑖= 1, 2.
(19.40)
These two eigenvalues represent two fundamental characteristic polarizations for the
coherent field.
The matrix [M] in (19.28) can be calculated by the scattering amplitude f𝑖j. From
small ellipsoidal objects, Rayleigh scattering is obtained by the static solution as given
in Section 10.6. Section 10.7 gives Rayleigh–Debye scattering including randomly
oriented objects.
19.6
VECTOR RADIATIVE TRANSFER THEORY
In Section 19.5, we showed the propagation constant in nonspherical particles. This
is the coherent field. This can be combined with the incoherent field to form the
complete vector radiative transfer theory. Let us start with the scalar radiative transfer

where γ is the extinction coefficient, and P is the phase function.
To include all polarization characteristics, we use the 4 × 1 Stokes specific intensity
vector [I].
The complete vector radiative transfer equation is then given by (Cheung, 1982;
Ishimaru, 1980)

Solutions for the vector radiative transfer (19.42) have been obtained numerically
(Ishimaru, 1997) for a plane wave incident on a slab of random medium of spherical
particles (Ishimaru, Cheung, 1980). The circularly polarized incident waves, the first-
order solutions, the coherent and incoherent components, and the cross-polarization
discrimination are calculated for rain at 30 GHz.
19.7
SPACE–TIME RADIATIVE TRANSFER
In Section 19.6, we discussed CW incident waves, which are also applicable to the
narrow band case. However, if the incident wave is a broadband short pulse, the CW
theory may not be appropriate and we need to consider the complete space–time
radiative transfer. Let us start with the scalar radiative transfer equation (19.41). For

the equation of transfer including the time dependence.
d
dsI = −γI −∂
c∂tI + ∫S(̂s, ̂s′)I(̂s′, t)dΩ′,
(19.45)
where I(t, ̂s′) is the time-dependent specific intensity, and γ and S are the extinction
coefficient and the phase function at the carrier frequency. This time-dependent
radiative transfer equation (19.45) is commonly used in pulse propagation problems.
Extensive work has been conducted based on this equation (Ishimaru et al., 2001). It
should be noted, however, that (19.45) is a narrow band approximation and a more
general formulation should start with the two-frequency specific intensity I(ω1, ω2).
I(t1, t2) = I(tc, td)

(19.46)
where I(ω1, ω2) is given by
I(ω1, ω2) = ⟨E(ω1)E∗(ω2)⟩,
I(t1, t2) = ⟨E(t1)E∗(t2)⟩,
ωc = 1
2(ω1 + ω2) = center frequency,
ωd = ω1 −ω2 = difference frequency,
tc = 1
2(t1 + t2) = center time,
td = t1 −t2 = difference time.
The specific intensity I(t1, t2) represents the correlation of the field at t1 and t2.
The radiative transfer equation for I(ω1, ω2) is given by
d
dsI = 𝑖[K(ω1) −K∗(ω2)]I + ∫S(ω1, ω2)I′dΩ′.
(19.47)
Noting that K(ω) = Kr(ω) + 𝑖K𝑖(ω), we get
K(ω1) −K∗(ω2) = [Kr(ω1) −Kr(ω2)] + 𝑖[K𝑖(ω1) + K𝑖(ω2)].

For a sparse distribution, we can use (19.34), and obtain approximately

We note however that (19.45) is an approximation and a more exact formulation
needs to start with the two-frequency radiative transfer (19.47). We also note that at a
given time tc with t1 = t2, I(tc, td = 0) gives the specific intensity for a pulse intensity
at tc.
I(tc) =
1
(2π) ∫I(ωd)e−𝑖ωdtcdωd.
(19.51)
Thus I(tc) satisfies (19.45).
19.8
WIGNER DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION AND SPECIFIC INTENSITY
In Section 19.7, we discussed the two-frequency specific intensity and its relation
with the two-frequency radiative transfer theory. It should, however, be noted that
the formulations given in the last section can be viewed from a more fundamental
formulation of the Wigner distribution.
Let us now start with the CW mutual coherence function (MCF) given by
Γ(̄r1, ̄r2) = ⟨U(̄r1)U∗(̄r2)⟩
= Γ(̄r, ̄rd),
(19.52)
where ̄r = 1
2(̄r1 + ̄r2) and ̄rd = ̄r1 −̄r2.
The Wigner distribution function W(̄r, ̄K) is the Fourier transform of Γ with respect
to ̄rd.

The Wigner function W has certain properties as shown here. First, the integral of W
with respect to the wave vector ̄K is the “energy density.”

(19.54)
Note that

(19.55)
Also note that W is real.
W∗(̄r, ̄K) = ∫

= W(̄r, ̄K)
(19.57)
showing that W(̄r, ̄K) is real.
The Wigner distribution function W is real and is closely related to the specific
intensity I(̄r, ̂s). The difference is that the specific intensity I is real and positive as
it represents the real power flow in the direction of ̂s. W(̄r, ̄K) is identical to I(̄r, ̂s)
if ̄K is limited to ̄K = k̂s where ̂s is the unit vector with |̂s| = 1. While I is real and
positive, W is real, but need not be positive.
Next consider the energy flux ̄F. For the specific intensity, we have
̄F = ∫I(̄r, ̂s)̂sdΩ.
(19.58)
The corresponding flux using Wigner function is given by
1
(2π)3 ∫W(̄r, ̄K) ̄Kd ̄K.
(19.59)
To show that (19.59) gives the Poynting vector, we start with the inverse Fourier
transform (19.53).

(19.63)
From (19.61), we finally get
1
(2π)3 ∫W(̄r, ̄K) ̄Kd ̄K = ̄S.

The temporal Wigner distribution function can be obtained similarly. We have

where ⟨̄U(ω1) ̄U∗(ω2)⟩is the two-frequency MCF.

W(t, ω) =

χ(ωd, td).
χ(ωd, td) = 1
2π ∫U(t1)U∗(t2)e𝑖ωdtdt.
(19.68)
From this, we can show that

STOKES VECTOR EMISSIVITY FROM PASSIVE SURFACE AND
OCEAN WIND DIRECTIONS
In Section 17.5, the brightness temperature Tα(̂𝑖) emitted in the direction (−̂𝑖) in the
polarization state α from a surface kept at temperature T is shown to be
Tα(̂𝑖) = εα(̂𝑖)T,
(19.70)
where εα(̂𝑖) is called the “emissivity.” It is also shown that if the surface is in thermal
equilibrium, the absorption must be equal to the emission and therefore, the emissivity
is equal to the absorptivity.
εα(̂𝑖) = aα(̂𝑖).
(19.71)
On the other hand, if a power is incident upon a surface, a part of the power is
scattered and the other part is absorbed. The ratio of the total scattered power to the
incident power in the projected area A cos θ𝑖is called the “albedo” denoted by Γα(𝑖).
The absorptivity aα is then the fractional power absorbed by the surface and is given
by
aα(̂𝑖) = 1 −Γα(̂𝑖) = εα(̂𝑖).
(19.72)
This shows that the emissivity of a passive surface is related to the scattering problem
when a wave is incident on a surface. The albedo Γα(̂𝑖) is given in (17.29) of Section
17.5.
This relationship (19.72) can be generalized to the Stokes vector formulation. It
is shown, (Tsang et al., 2000) that Tα and εα (19.70) are generalized to the Stokes
vector. We have

If we can measure T1, T2, U, and V, then the scattering characteristics of the sur-
face and the ocean wind directions may be determined as shown in (19.73). The
measurement of the Stokes vector can be made by using the technique described
in Section 16.10. T1 and T2 can be obtained by the intensities in vertical and
horizontal polarizations. U can be obtained by measuring the power in 45◦and
135◦. V can be obtained by the power for the right-handed and left-handed circular
polarizations.
It has been noted that for a sea surface, Tv and Th are even functions of the azimuth
angle ϕ and U and V are the odd functions of ϕ, where ϕ = ϕw −ϕr, ϕw = wind
direction and ϕr is the radiometer look direction (Fig. 19.7). Using up to the second

It has been experimentally and numerically observed that Tv, Th, and U behave as

is therefore possible to determine the ocean wind direction by measuring the Stokes

VAN CITTERT–ZERNIKE THEOREM APPLIED
TO APERTURE SYNTHESIS RADIOMETERS INCLUDING
ANTENNA TEMPERATURE
In Sections 17.9 and 17.10, we discussed a special case of the Fourier transform
relationship between the source brightness distribution of the incoherent source and
the degree of coherence. This is a special case of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem. In
this section, we revisit this problem as applied to passive microwave remote sensing.
In particular, we include the effects of the antenna temperature (Corbella et al., 2004;
Camps et al., 2008; Wedge and Rutledge, 1991).

van Cittert–Zernike theorem relating the source brightness distribution T(̄rs, ̂s)
to the visibility function V(̄r1, ̄r2).
Let us start with the van Cittert–Zernike theorem. It relates the MCF V(̄r𝑖, ̄rj) of
electromagnetic waves at two points ̄r𝑖and ̄rj and the source brightness distribution
T(̄rs, ̂s) of the thermal source (Fig. 19.9).
V(̄r1, ̄r2) = ∫G(̂s)T(̄rs, ̂s)e𝑖k(R1−R2)

dΩ,
(19.75)
where ̂s is the unit vector in the direction to ̄rs, and G(̂s) is the directivity pattern of
the antenna.
V(̄r1, ̄r2) is called the “visibility function.” dΩ is the elementary solid angle dΩ =
sin θ dθ dϕ.
In the parabolic approximation, we have
R1 = R + |̄r1 −̄rs|2
2R
,
R2 = R + |̄r2 −̄rs|2
2R
.
(19.76)
We then have

We also note that
dζdη = cos θ dΩ =
√
1 −ξ2 −η2dΩ,
where ξ = sin θ cos ϕ and η = sin θ sin ϕ are the direction cosines of ̂s. The extra
phase

is the difference between ̄rs = 0 to ̄r1and ̄r2 in wavelength and is
independent of ̂s and can be absorbed in G. We finally get the following Fourier trans-
form representation of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem commonly used in remote
sensing.

(19.78)
where u = x1 −x2, v = y1 −y2.
This Fourier transform relationship means that if we make measurements of the
visibility function, which is the spatial correlation of the waves at different pairs of two
points ̄r1 and ̄r2, then in principle, we can invert the measured visibility at different
spacings by inverse Fourier transform and obtain the temperature distribution T(̄rs, ̂s).
19.10.1
The Effects of Antenna Temperature and Bosma Theorem
The van Cittert–Zernike theorem (19.78) does not include the effects of antenna tem-
perature. The Bosma theorem relates the correlation of the noise temperature to the
antenna temperature and the scattering matrix. Consider two receiving antennas with
antenna temperature Ta with reflectionless terminations (Fig. 19.10). The incident
wave (a1, a2), the output (b1, b2), and the noise wave (bs1, bs2) are related by the
scattering matrix S.

The incident wave [a] emanates from the termination and is uncorrelated with the
noise [bs]. The incident power is due to the thermal noise from terminations at
temperature Ta and therefore we have, per unit bandwidth (1 Hz),
⟨|a1|2⟩= ⟨|a2|2⟩= KTa,
⟨a1a∗

⟩= 0,
(19.80)
where K is Boltzmann’s constant.
From (19.79), we get
⟨bb+⟩= ⟨Saa+S+⟩+ ⟨bsb+

(19.81)
where b+ is the conjugate transpose of b.

(19.82)
This shows the correlation of the output waves b1 and b2.
The correlation of the wave bs1 and bs2 from the thermal noise is the visibility
function given in (19.78).
⟨bs1b∗

(19.83)
Equation (19.83) shows that there is a difference between the correlation of the output
wave ⟨b1b∗
2⟩and the visibility function V(u, v).
In order to find the difference KTa[S11S∗
21 + S12S∗
22], we use the Bosma theorem,
which relates the noise wave and the scattering matrix under thermodynamic equi-
librium, in which case, the powers |a|2 and |b|2 need to be balanced, and we have
|a1|2 = |a2|2 = |b1|2 = |b2|2 = KTa,
⟨a1a∗

⟨b1b∗

Under this thermodynamic equilibrium, we can write (19.82) as
⟨bsb+

⟩= KTa(1 −SS+)
(19.85)
This is the Bosma theorem.
If we surround these two antennas with a microwave absorber with constant
temperature Ta, then we get the thermodynamic equilibrium and the Bosma theorem
applies. We can write (19.82) as
0 = KTa
[S11S∗

(19.86)
where V(at Ta) is the visibility function (19.78) with T = Ta. Thus we get
KTa
[S11S∗

(19.87)
Substituting this into (19.82) we finally get

⟨b1b∗

the generalized van Cittert–Zernike theorem including the temperature Ta. This was
derived by Corbella (2004).

IONOSPHERIC EFFECTS ON SAR IMAGE
Space-borne SAR has been used for measuring forest biomass. However, microwave
frequencies such as c-band (4–8 GHz, wavelength 7.5–3.8 cm) used in conventional
SAR cannot penetrate into foliage and therefore lower frequencies, typically P-band
(250–500 MHz) are employed for biomass studies. At these low frequencies, how-
ever, ionospheric effects become significant. These effects include reduced azimuthal
resolution due to the reduced coherent length, dispersion causing group delay, a shift
of image in the range, pulse broadening, and Faraday rotation. In this section, we
present analytical studies on these effects (Ishimaru et al., 1999).
The coherent received signal v(̄r0) of SAR focused on ̄r0 is given by
v(̄r0) = ∫S(̄r)χ(̄r, ̄r0)ds,
(19.89)
where S(̄r) is the surface reflectivity at ̄r and χ is the generalized ambiguity function
(system point target response) given by (Fig. 19.11)
χ(̄r, ̄r0) =
∑
n ∫gn(t, ̄rn)f ∗

This is the coherent sum of the signal gn(t, ̄rn) received at ̄rsn due to a point target
at ̄r illuminated by an incident pulse u𝑖(t). fn(t, ̄r0n) is a matched filter function
focused at ̄r0. It may be noted that in the imaging studies, fn(t, ̄r0n) is also called the
“steering vector” or “focusing function” focused on the “search point” ̄r0 (Ishimaru
et al., 2012).
We take the Fourier transform of (19.90) and obtain in the frequency domain

β(ω) = β(ω0) + (ω −ω0)β′(ω0) + (ω −ω0)2
2
β′′(ω0) + ⋯
(19.97)
β′(ω0) gives the group delay and β′′(ω0) gives the pulse broadening. ψd + ψu in
(19.92) is caused by the fluctuations of the ionospheric turbulence and gives the
broadening of the SAR image.
In Fig. 19.12, we show these three effects, azimuthal resolution Δy′, the pulse
broadening Δx′, and the group delay ΔU.
We can now write χn in (19.96) in the following form:

Faraday Rotation
When a linearly polarized radio wave propagates through the ionosphere, the medium
becomes anisotropic as discussed in Chapter 8, and the wave will be split into two
circular polarized waves with two different propagation constants. After propagation,
these two waves recombine to give a linearly polarized wave with the plane of
polarization rotated in proportion to the geomagnetic field and the distance. Figure
19.9 shows a wave propagating in the z direction with the geomagnetic field Hdc
pointed in the direction of the masking angle θ. At z = 0, the wave is given by Ex(0)
and Ey(0), and at z ≠0, the wave is given by Ex(z) and Ey(z). They are related through

For P-band (500 MHz) at 400–600 km altitude, the azimuthal resolution of SAR can
be seriously affected in an average ionosphere (30 TECU, variance 10%). TEC is the
total electron content, the integration of the electron density over the vertical path
from the ground to the upper ionosphere. TECU is the unit = 1016m−2electrons. For
the range resolution at P-band, the image shift can be significant. Faraday rotation is
significant at P-band.

CHAPTER 20
BIOMEDICAL EM, OPTICS, AND
ULTRASOUND
Imaging and detection of malignant tissue are important in health care. Applications
of EM energy for medical purposes are important but require careful attention to
unintended deleterious biological effects. EM fields from static to terahertz are used
in these applications, but they require careful study of safety and health precautions.
In this chapter, we discuss some key formulations in biomedical electromagnetics.
Extensive work has been reported on static through terahertz coupling to bodies near
fields, cell phones, specific absorption rate (SAR), narrow and UWB pulse in bio-
logical systems (Lin, 2012). In this chapter, we consider SAR and heat diffusion in
tissues. For bio-optics, we discuss optical scattering and imaging in tissues (Tuchin
and Thompson, 1994) and optical diffusion and photon density waves. Optical coher-
ence tomography (OCT) and low coherence interferometry are extensively used in
medical imaging (Fujimoto, 2001). Fundamentals of ultrasound scattering and imag-
ing of tissues and blood are discussed in this chapter (Shung and Thieme, 1993).
An overview of acoustical and optical scattering and imaging of tissues is given by
Ishimaru (2001).
As we examine these formulations, it is important to clearly understand the dif-
ferences among EM, optics, and ultrasound characteristics in biological media. For
EM, whose frequency may be of the order of 1 GHz, the wavelength is comparable
to geometric sizes of bodies. Therefore the electric field distribution in a biological
medium depends very much on the size and shape of the medium, which requires

numerical study of boundary value problems. It is also necessary to use a higher fre-
quency if we wish to reduce the wavelength and to improve the resolution. However,
higher frequency (shorter wavelength) increases absorption and reduces skin depth,
resulting in smaller illuminating power and reduced signal-to-noise ratio.
For optics, the wavelength in tissues is of the order of 1 μm. However, the tissues
have small loss and large scattering, resulting in multiple scattering and diffusion. The
resolution is poor, requiring the use of techniques such as photon density waves. For
short distances, other techniques such as OCT can be used, which will be discussed
later. For ultrasound of 1 MHz to 10 MHz and to 50 MHz, the wavelength (in
water) is 1.5 mm, 0.15 mm, and 30 μm. Absorption is significant, but scattering
is small. Therefore, the single scattering process is dominant, helping resolution
and mathematical analysis. Multiple scattering by tissues are negligibly small for
ultrasound. It may be noted that high-frequency ultrasound imaging up to 50 MHz
is considered a new frontier in tissue imaging though the penetration depth may be
8–9 mm (Shung et al., 2009).
20.1
BIOELECTROMAGNETICS
Electromagnetic fields in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 GHz can be trans-
mitted through a biological medium with varying degrees of absorption, reflection,
and scattering. Reflection occurs at tissue boundaries, and scattering is caused by
inhomogeneities of the order of a wavelength in tissues (Ishimaru, 1997; Lin, 2012;
Johnson and Guy, 1972).
Microwave frequencies of 27.12, 915, and 2450 MHz are used for diathermy in
the United States, and 433 MHz is used in Europe. Other medical applications of
microwaves include warming of refrigerated bank blood to body temperature prior
to transfusion, and selective heating of a cancer or tumor area for administration of
anticancer drugs. Microwave ovens are typically operated at 2450 MHz at a normal
power of 2 kW with a maximum of 5.25 kW. The frequency bands used for cellular
phones cover 800 MHz to 2.6 GHz and their biological effects have been extensively
studied (Lin, 2012).
The effect of microwaves on biological systems may be thermal or nonthermal. The
power absorbed by the tissues produces a temperature rise that depends on the cooling
and heat diffusion mechanisms of the tissues. When the thermoregulatory capability
of the system is exceeded, tissue damage and death can result. The maximum rec-
ommended safe power density for long-term human exposures is 10 mW/cm2 in the
United States. Soviet scientists reported that the central nervous system is sensitive
to microwaves at intensities below thermal thresholds and have set the safety power
level at 0.01 mW/cm2.
The dielectric constants of tissues with high water content, such as muscle and
skin, have been investigated thoroughly (Johnson and Guy, 1972) and are shown in
Fig. 20.1. The dielectric constants of tissues with low water content, such as fat and
bone, are also shown in Fig. 20.1. The values of ε and σ vary with temperature at the
rate of +2 and −0.5%∕◦C, respectively.

A key quantity in bio-EM is “SAR,” which is the power loss per unit mass of
biological media when the incident power flux density is 1 mW/cm2 (= 10 W/m2).
SAR = L
ρ (watts∕kg),
where
L = ωσ0ε′′
2
|E|2 = σ|E|2

.
(20.1)
L is the power dissipation per unit volume of the medium (W/ m3), E is the electric
field (volt/m), σ is the conductivity (S/m) of the medium, and ρ is the density of the
medium (kg/m3). The density ρ for SAR (20.1) is usually taken to be that of water
(ρ = 103 kg/m3).
There has been extensive research on EM fields in biological media (Lin, 2012)
covering extremely low-frequency waves (ELF) to radio frequency waves (RF) to
microwaves.
20.2
BIO-EM AND HEAT DIFFUSION IN TISSUES
As tissues are illuminated by EM waves, some of the EM power is dissipated in the
lossy medium and converted into heat energy. The heat energy is then diffused in the

660
BIOMEDICAL EM, OPTICS, AND ULTRASOUND
medium and the associated temperature varies. This section gives a brief introduction
to the heat diffusion in a biological medium.
Let us consider a biological medium illuminated by an incident power flux of
1 mW/cm2. The power loss L per unit volume can be calculated by finding the
electric field E and knowing the conductivity σ (or ε′′) of the biological medium. The
power loss L is converted into heat, which raises the temperature. If the temperature
varies from point to point in a medium, then the heat flow per unit area is proportional
to the temperature gradient.
̄F = −K∇T,
(20.2)
where K (W∕m◦C) is the thermal conductivity and ̄F (W∕m2) is the heat flux per
unit area.
The internal energy per unit mass u (J/kg) in differential form is given by the
specific heat Cs (J∕kg◦C) and the temperature ΔT.
du = CsdT.
(20.3)
Note that energy is in joules J (Ws = Nm = m2kg∕s2). The internal energy per
unit volume ρu (J∕m3) and the heat flow ̄F satisfy the conservation of power; ρ is the
density (kg∕m3).
ρCs
∂T
∂t + ∇∙̄F = q,
(20.4)
where q is the energy introduced or subtracted from the medium per unit volume
(W∕m3), which will be discussed later. Substituting (20.2) into (20.4), we finally get
the diffusion equation for the temperature
ρCs
∂T
∂t = ∇∙(K∇T) + q.
(20.5)
This diffusion equation is often written as
∂T
∂t = a2∇2T +
q
ρCs
,
(20.6)
where a is called the “diffusion constant,”
a =
[
K
ρCs
]1∕2
.
(20.7)
In a biological medium, the energy is introduced by the EM power loss L, which
is converted into heat, and the energy C, subtracted from the medium by blood flow.
We can then write
q = L −C.
(20.8)

BIO-EM AND HEAT DIFFUSION IN TISSUES
661
L is given in (20.1), and C is the cooling function and can be approximated by
C = hb(T −Tb),
(20.9)
where T is the tissue temperature, Tb is the average local arterial blood temperature,
and hb is the heat transfer coefficient.
The diffusion equation (20.6) with (20.8) is a simplified form of the bioheat
equation developed by Pennes in (1948). More complete forms of the bioheat equa-
tion include the porosity of the tissue and blood velocity (Khaled and Vafai, 2003;
Nakayama and Kuwahara, 2008). Van den Berg and others (1983) gave a computa-
tional model of EM heating of tissues including the cooling function. The cooling
function (20.9) is a first-order approximation, which may be applicable when the
temperature is below a critical temperature (Chan et al., 1973).
The solution of the diffusion equation (20.6) requires the boundary conditions. On
the surface, the outward power flux must be proportional to the difference between
the surface temperature and the environmental temperature Te.
−K ∂T
∂n = E(T −Te).
(20.10)
This is called the “Newton cooling law” (Pennes, 1948). This is consistent with
the boundary conditions used by Ayappa et al. (1991) where the constant (E/K)
is proportional to the Biot number (Chen and Peng, 2005). This is also consistent
with that used by Taflove and Brodwin (1975). It should be noted, however, that
the boundary condition for the diffusion equation is inherently inaccurate because it
takes some distance from the boundary for any physical quantities such as waves or
particles to diffuse.
Mathematically, we can have at the boundary
(1) Uniform temperature,
T = constant.
(20.11)
(2) No heat transfer
∂T
∂n = 0.
(20.12)
It may be added that light diffusion in a multiple scattering medium obeys the same
diffusion equation. If the medium is an isotropic scatterer, the boundary condition is
given by (Ishimaru, 1997)
U = 0.7104 ls
∂
∂nU,
(20.13)
where ls is the scattering mean free path. U is the average intensity, which satisfies
the diffusion equation (Ishimaru, 1997)
∂U
∂t = a2∇2U + Q.
(20.14)

The average intensity U in a multiple scattering medium is therefore equivalent to
the temperature.
The diffusion equation (20.6) needs to be solved with boundary conditions. It
is, however, instructive to find the diffusion solution in an infinite medium. For an
arbitrary excitation (q∕ρcs), we can use Green’s function. For a one-dimensional
diffusion equation, we have

(20.17)
Green’s function G(t,x) satisfies
∂
∂tG = a2 ∂2
∂x2 G + S(t)S(x).
(20.18)
We can take the Fourier transform in t and x, and obtain
̄G(w, λ) =

𝑖w −a2λ2
(20.19)
Taking the inverse Fourier transform, we write
G(t, x) =
1
(2π)2 ∫e−𝑖wtdw ∫e+𝑖λxdλ ̄G(w, λ).
(20.20)
The integration with dw can be performed by noting the pole at wp = −𝑖a2λ2 and
taking the residue. We then perform λ−integration and obtain
G(t, x) =

imations (20.11) or (20.12). Equation (20.11) is equivalent to the case of the surface

infinite, and if we use this boundary condition, we get Green’s function
G(t, x) = G(t, x −x0)G(t, x + x0).
(20.22)
Formulations in this section are concerned with the microwave heating of tissues,
and the heat diffusion. This same technique can be used to study the heat diffusion
and the temperature rise in objects illuminated by high-power optical beam. The
CO2 optical beam with varied pulse duration may be focused through atmosphere
and incident upon copper, water, or composite targets, causing temperature rise
(Stonebeck et al., 2013).
20.3
BIO-OPTICS, OPTICAL ABSORPTION AND
SCATTERING IN BLOOD
Optical propagation in biological materials is dominated by scattering because the
inhomogeneities of cellular structures and particle sizes are of the order of an optical
wavelength. Cells are commonly several microns in diameter. Muscle cells may be
a few millimeters long and nerve cells may be over a meter long. A cell consists of
a thin membrane, ≈75 ˚A thick, cytoplasm, and a nucleus. Epithelial tissues consist
of cells in layered membranes that cover or line a surface and perform the functions
of protection and regulation of secretion. Connective tissues support and connect
cellular tissue to the skeleton. Muscle tissues consist of cells that are 1–40 mm long
and up to 40 μm in diameter. Nervous tissues consist of nerve cells called neurons
that transmit information between the central nervous system and muscle, organs,
glands, etc. (Johnson and Guy, 1972, p. 709; Ishimaru, 1997).
Light has been used to determine the oxygen content in blood. Red blood cells
(erythrocytes) have the shape of a biconcave disk with a broad diameter of about 7 μm
and a thickness of about 1 μm in the center and about 2 μm near the edges. Erythrocytes
are continuously formed in the bone marrow, fed into the bloodstream, and absorbed
and reprocessed in the liver. Normally there are about 5 × 106 erythrocytes/mm3.
About 40% of the volume of whole blood consists of erythrocytes, and this percentage
is called hematocrit H. Therefore, normal blood has H = 0.4. The remaining 60% is
a nearly transparent solution of water and salt called plasma.
Red blood cells contain hemoglobin molecules Hb, which are easily oxygenated
to oxyhemoglobin molecules HbO2. Oxygen saturation OS is defined as the ratio
of oxyhemoglobin [HbO2] to total hemoglobin [HbO2] + [Hb]. In order to obtain
the optical absorption characteristic of hemoglobin itself, the erythrocyte membrane
is ruptured and the hemoglobin is released into solution. This solution is called
hemolyzed blood and is a homogeneous absorbing medium. The decrease of light
intensity dI in this medium is proportional to the intensity I and the elementary
distance dz
dI = −αldz.
(20.23)

664
BIOMEDICAL EM, OPTICS, AND ULTRASOUND
The intensity therefore decays exponentially
I(z) = I(0) exp(−αz).
(20.24)
This is called the Lambert–Beer law. The absorption constant α is dependent on
the molecular concentration C (moles∕cm3) and the specific absorption coefficient
κ(cm2∕mole)
α = Cκ.
(20.25)
The specific absorption coefficients κh and κo of hemoglobin Hb and oxyhemoglobin
HbO2 of hemolyzed blood are shown in Fig. 20.2. Oxyhemoglobin HbO2 has low
absorption in the red region of the spectrum and thus blood looks red when oxy-
hemoglobin is predominant. The absorption of Hb and that of HbO2 are equal at
λ = 0.548, 0.568, 0.587, and 0.805 μm. These wavelengths are called isosbestic
points.
Consider a light beam sent through a slab of thickness D. Transmittance T and
reflectance R are defined as the ratios of transmitted to incident intensity and reflected
to incident intensity, respectively. The optical density OD is defined as
OD = log(T−1).
(20.26)
The optical density of hemolyzed blood with oxygen saturation OS is given by
OD = 0.4343Cκd,

where Cκ is an average of κo and κh in proportion to their concentrations and is
given by Cκ = Coκo + Chκh. Co and Ch are the concentrations of HbO2 and Hb,
respectively, and κo and κh are the specific absorption coefficients of HbO2 and Hb,
respectively. Noting that OS = Co∕(Co + Ch), we can also write
C = Co + Ch,
κ = κh + OS(κo −κh).
(20.28)
By making measurements of the optical density OD of hemolyzed blood at two
wavelengths and knowing κo and κh at these wavelengths from Fig. 20.2, we can
determine the oxygen saturation OS.
The optical density of whole blood is significantly different from that of hemolyzed
blood because in whole blood, hemoglobin is packaged in erythrocytes and consid-
erable light scattering takes place. The scattering and absorption characteristics of
erythrocytes (red blood cells) are most conveniently represented by cross sections.
Typical cross sections are shown in Table 20.1.
The hematocrit H is related to the number density ρ and the volume Ve of a single
erythrocyte
ρ = H∕Ve.
(20.29)
Therefore the absorption coefficient ρσa is given by
μa = ρσa = Hσa∕Ve.
(20.30)
The scattering coefficient ρσs is also given by
μs = ρσs = Hσs∕Ve,
(20.31)
if H is sufficiently small (H < 0.2). For H > 0.5, the particles are densely packed and
the medium becomes almost homogeneous with absorbing hemoglobin material. In
this case, the whole blood may be viewed as a homogeneous hemoglobin medium
with the scattering particles made of the plasma between red blood cells. In the
limit H →1, the “plasma particles” disappear and ρσs should approach zero. This
consideration leads to the following approximate representation of ρσs
μs = ρσs = H(1 −H)σs∕Ve,
(20.32)
where the multiplying factor (1-H) takes care of the disappearance of scattering as
H →1. Often complete packing (H = 1) cannot be reached and the effect of packing

666
BIOMEDICAL EM, OPTICS, AND ULTRASOUND
cannot be expressed by a simple factor such as (1-H). For example, if the particles
are rigid spheres, H cannot exceed 0.64. We should then write
μs = ρσs = (Hσs∕Ve)f(H),
(20.33)
where f(H) should monotonically decrease from 1 at H = 0 to 0 at a certain value of
H. The function f(H), called the “packing factor,” for rigid spheres is given by the
Percus–Yevick packing factor
f(H) = (1 −H)4
(1 + 2H)2 .
(20.34)
20.4
OPTICAL DIFFUSION IN TISSUES
As noted in Section 20.3, the optical propagation in whole blood depends on not only
the absorption and scattering characteristics of a single blood cell, but how much the
particles are packed. This is given by the fractional volume, H, which is the ratio of
the volume occupied by the particles to the total volume. If H is much smaller than
one, the scattering is small and single scattering takes place. As H increases, double
scattering and multiple scattering need to be considered. As H increases further, the
wave scatters in all directions and its behaviors approach “random walk,” and this is
equivalent to the “diffusion” (Fig. 20.3).
In this section, we discuss diffusion approximation (Ishimaru, 1997, Section 7.3
and Chapter 9). The transport of optical energy in tissue and blood is given by the
radiative transfer equation in Section 17.4. In terms of the specific intensity I(̄r, ̂s),

(20.35)
where μt = ρσt is the extinction coefficient, p(̂s, ̂s′) is the phase function, and ρ is the
number density (#/vol) and σt is the extinction cross section of a single particle.
The specific intensity I is given by the coherent component called the “reduced
incident intensity” Ir𝑖and the diffuse component Id. Ir𝑖satisfies the equation
dIr𝑖
ds = −μtIr𝑖.
(20.36)
The diffuse component Id satisfies the equation

(20.38)
The phase function p(̂s, ̂s′) is related to the scattering amplitude f(̂s, ̂s) of a single
particle as shown in Section (10.1).

As shown in Ishimaru (1997, Chapter 9), the diffusion approximation is based on
the assumption that the diffuse intensity encounters many particles and is scattered

conservation.
∇∙̄Fd = −4πμaUd(̄r) + 4πμsUr𝑖+ E(̄r),

(20.45)
This process of first obtaining ∇∙̄F and then expressing ̄F as a gradient of U and
combining these two to obtain the fundamental equation (20.44) is commonly used
in many physical problems.
The transport cross section σtr shows that if scattering is not isotropic, the equiv-
alent scattering cross section and the attenuation due to scattering are reduced by a
factor g, which is called the “anisotropy factor” or “the mean cosine of the scattering
angle.”
Note that K2
d is negative and therefore Kd is purely imaginary giving a diffusion
characteristic.
The exact boundary condition for the diffuse intensity Id is that at the surface
there should be no diffuse intensity entering the medium from outside. However,
the diffusion approximation is based on the approximation (20.40) and therefore the
exact boundary condition cannot be satisfied. One approximate boundary condition
is that the total diffuse flux directed inward must be zero. This can be expressed as

development of oximeter using optical fibers (Ishimaru, 1997).
20.5
PHOTON DENSITY WAVES
In Section 20.4, we discussed the diffusion approximation of the radiative transfer
theory. In the diffusion approximation, the specific intensity has a broad angular spec-
trum and therefore the diffused wave cannot be focused into a small volume. There is
a way to focus the diffused wave, but the focusing requires constructive interference
near the focal point and destructive interference elsewhere. This is a wave-like behav-
ior including phase. The diffusion is the diffusion of the intensity, not a field with
amplitude and phase. There is a way to include the phase information in the diffusion
approximation of the intensity. If the intensity consists of a constant background plus
a modulated intensity, so that the total intensity is always positive, then the modulated
intensity behaves as if it is a wave (Ishimaru, 1978; Jaruwatanadilok et al., 2002).
Let us write the total specific intensity as
I(̄r, t) = Ic(̄r) + Im(̄r)e−𝑖ωmt,
(20.47)
where ωm is the modulation frequency. Let us write the time-dependent radiative
transfer equation for the component Im.

of exp(−𝑖ωmt), we replace ∂
∂t in (20.48) by (−𝑖ωm). We then follow the procedure in
Section 20.4 of obtaining ∇∙̄Fd and grad Ud and combining these two. We get the
following diffusion equation for the modulation part of the intensity.

It may be noted that the diffusion equation (20.49) is similar to the equation for the
thermal diffusion for temperature T.

(20.52)
Thus, the diffusion of the photon density wave is similar to the waves in (20.51) and
(20.52).
It may be instructive to examine the case of small absorption. If we assume that
μa is negligibly small, we have
(
∇2 + 𝑖ωm

U = 0.
(20.53)
This is identical to the wave in conductive medium with large conductivity. We then

get λm ≈3.3 cm. However, this is based on an approximation (20.53). More accurate
estimates should be obtained by (20.49).
20.6
OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY AND LOW
COHERENCE INTERFEROMETRY
OCT was introduced to obtain noninvasive images of biological images of biological
tissues with resolutions of 1–15 μm (Fujimoto, 2001; Gabriele, et al., 2011; Huang
et al., 1991). The images are generated by measuring the echo time delay and the
light intensity backscattered from tissues. The echo time delay is measured by using
low coherence light. The backscattered light from the sample is interfered with low
coherence light. The interference occurs only when the two path lengths match to
within the coherence length. By varying the path length of the low coherence light, the
echo time delay can be varied. This is equivalent to short pulses but it uses continuous-
wave light without the need for ultrashort pulses. A sketch of the schematic of OCT
is shown in Fig. 20.5.

In this section, we discuss a theory of OCT following Schmitt and Knuttel (1997),
Thrane et al. (2000), Ishimaru (1997, 2012), and Ralston et al. (2006). The detector
produces the heterodyne photo current 𝑖s (Fig. 20.6). The amplitude of the photo
current is proportional to the correlation of the reference beam Ur and the sample
beam Us (Schmitt and Knittel, 1997), and is given by
𝑖s = (2ζq) ∫A
Ur(̄ρ, ω)U∗
s (̄ρ, ω)d̄ρ,
(20.58)
where ζ is the quantum efficiency and q is the electron charge (Fig. 20.5). A is an
aperture area at z = 0. Here we start with frequency domain. Time-domain expression
is obtained later by Fourier transform.
We first discuss the axial resolution. There are many papers and books written on
OCT including Izatt and Choma (2008) and Schmitt (1999). As shown in Fig. 20.5,
the wave U0 is incident on a Michelson interferometer. The incident wave is from a
low coherent source and a polychromatic wave. We express U0 in the analytic signal
shown in Section 4.10. (Goodman, 1985).
U0(t) = u0(t) exp(−𝑖ω0t),
(20.59)
where u0 is the complex envelope and ω0 is the center frequency (carrier frequency).
It is assumed that this is a low coherence wave and that the complex envelope u0 is

lc = cτc,

A typical OCT coherence source is a light emitting diode (Schmitt, 1999) with
center wavelength λ0 = 1300 nm and bandwidth Δλ0 = 50–100 nm which gives the
coherence length lc ≈22 ∼11 μm.
The incident field U0 with coherence time (20.67) and the coherence length lc
(20.68) is now incident on the Michelson interferometer shown in Fig. 20.5. The
incident wave U0(t) propagates and splits into U1 and U2 in Fig. 20.5. U1 travels to
the reference mirror and is reflected back to become K1U0, and U2 is reflected back
by the sample and becomes K2U0. K1 and K2 include the effects of the beam splitter
and reflections. The total U1 + U2 is incident on the detector. The output from the
detector Id is then given by
Id = ⟨|K1U0 + K2U0|2⟩
= |U0|2(K2
1 + K2
2 + 2Re(K1K2)Γ12
),
(20.70)
where Γ12 is the mutual coherence function.
Let us examine Γ12. Note that U1 traveled a distance of 2z1 while U2 traveled a
distance of 2z2. Therefore we have, except for the common distance from the beam
splitter to the detector,
U1 = U0e𝑖k(2z1),
U2 = U0e𝑖k(2z2).
(20.71)
We then have
Γ12 = ⟨|U0|2e𝑖k2(z1−z2)⟩,
k = (ω∕c).
(20.72)

The detected output Id is then given by
Id = |U0|2[K2
1 + K2
2 + 2K1K2 cos(k2(z1 −z2)].
(20.73)
This is sketched in Fig. 20.6. Note that in the neighborhood of k = k0, the peak appears
when k2(z1 −z2) ≈k02(z1 −z2) with k ≈k0 as multiples of 2π and the first minimum
is when the path length difference |z1 −z2| is λ0∕4. Note that the term with k2
1 + k2
2 is
the DC term and the second term represents the cross correlation between two beams
U1 and U2 which is the desired component. The main peak occurs when |z1 −z2|
and Id diminishes as |z1 −z2| increases. In particular, when |z1 −z2| exceeds the
coherence length lc, then Id becomes negligibly small. Therefore the axial resolution
is given by the path difference |z1 −z2| ≈lc.
Let us next consider the transverse resolution. If the aperture with the diameter
2W0 transmits a beam wave focused at Rf , the transverse spot size and the focal plane
(z = Rf ) is given by (Section 6.6)
Ws =
λRf
πW0
.
(20.74)
The axial spot size (resolution) is given by the coherence length lc (20.67)
Δz = lc = 0.664
(

)
.
(20.75)
In addition, the depth of focus Δzd is given by
Δzd =
λR2
f
πW2

.
(20.76)
This is obtained by noting that the intensity of a beam wave on axis is given by (6.66)
I = I0
W2

W2
(20.77)
and Δzd is obtained by finding the distance at which the beam intensity becomes
(1/2) of the intensity at the focal point.
I(z = Rf + Δz) = 1
2I(Z = Rf ).
(20.78)
If Rf ≫W0, then Δzd may become greater than Δz = lc and the coherence length
determines the axial resolution (Fig. 20.7).

ULTRASOUND SCATTERING AND IMAGING OF TISSUES
In Sections 20.1 through 20.6, we discussed propagation and scattering characteris-
tics of electromagnetic and optical waves in biological media and their applications
to imaging of the biological medium. Ultrasound imaging has advantages over other
electromagnetic and optical imaging. It is noninvasive and relatively inexpensive to
collect anatomical and blood flow information. However, there are ultrasound speck-
les or texture that are not well understood and therefore it is necessary to study
the scattering phenomena for proper interpretation and development of ultrasound
imaging. In this section, we start with the basic formulation of the ultrasound scatter-
ing theory (Ishimaru, 1997; Ishimaru, 2001; Shung and Thieme, 1993; Shung et al.,
2009).
Acoustic scattering was discussed in Section 10.11 and the radar equation in
Section 10.2 can be used to describe the scattered power from tissues illuminated by
ultrasound.
For ultrasound, tissues can be considered a “random continuum,” which means that
the density ρ and the compressibility κ are continuous random functions of position.
Under this assumption, we first obtain the scattering cross section per unit volume of
the tissue.
Consider a volume δv of the tissues with density ρe and compressibility κe which
are different from the surrounding average density ρ and compressibility κ. Under
the assumption that the medium ρc and κc are only slightly different from ρ and κ,
we can use the Born approximation to obtain the following well-known formula for
the scattering amplitude:
f(̂o, ̂𝑖) = k2
4π ∫δv
(γκ+γρ cos θ)e𝑖̄ks∙̄r′dv′,
where
γκ = κe −κ
κ
= compressibility fluctuation,
γρ = ρe −ρ
ρe
= density fluctuation.

Incident wave is propagating in the direction of ̂𝑖and the scattered wave is
observed in the direction of ̂o.
We then obtain the differential scattering coefficient σd or the differential cross section

where
γ(̄r) = γκ(̄r) + γρ(̄r) cos θ,
and
̄ks = k(̂𝑖−̂o).
(20.80)
If the medium is assumed to be statistically homogenous and isotropic, then the
covariance ⟨γ(̄r1)γ(̄r2)⟩is a function of the magnitude of the difference |̄r1 −̄r2|.
Then, the double integral in (20.80) can be expressed as a Fourier transform of the
covariance function ⟨γ(̄r1)γ(̄r2)⟩which is called the spectral density as noted by the
Wiener–Khinchin theorem.
We can express (20.80) using the spectral densities
Sγ(̄ks) =
1
(2π)3 ∫Bγ(̄rd)e𝑖̄ks∙̄rddvd,
(20.81)
and Bγ(̄rd) is the correlation function given by
Bγ(̄rd) = ⟨γ(̄r1)γ(̄r2)⟩= Bκ(̄rd) + Bρ(̄rd) cos2 θ + 2Bκρ(̄rd) cos θ.
(20.82)
We therefore have the expression for σd
σd(̂o, ̂𝑖) =
(π

The unit commonly used for σd (differential cross section per unit volume) of the
tissue is cm2∕(cm3sr) = cm−1sr−1 where sr = steradian (unit solid angle).
Tissues such as myocardium are often anisotropic. For example, they may be elon-
gated in one direction. This can be expressed using a Gaussian correlation function
as

Bκρ(̄rd) ≈0.

ks2 = k(sin θ𝑖sin ϕ𝑖−sin θ0 sin ϕ0),
ks3 = k(cos θ𝑖−cos θ0).
(20.86)
It is known that anisotropic tissues such as those shown above exhibit the double
peaks in the scattering pattern.
The Gaussian spectrum (20.66) is often used since it is mathematically simple
and includes the essential parameters σκ, l1, l2, and l3. However, other spectra which
may be more representative of the actual tissues have been proposed including fluid
spheres, exponentials, and modified exponentials. Here, we add the following power-
law spectrum.
Sκ(̄ks) = Sκ(0)[1 + (ks1l1)2 + (ks2l2)2 + (ks3l3)2)]−n∕2,
(20.87)
where ks1, ks2, and ks3 are given in (20.86), and n is called “spectral index.”
If the spectral index n is 3, (20.87) reduces to the “Henyey–Greenstein” formula
and if n = 4, it reduces to the spectrum for the exponential correlation function. In

The acoustic attenuation coefficient per unit length α for tissues generally varies as
f n, where f is the frequency and n ranges from 1 to 2. The attenuation coefficients α of
muscle, liver, kidney, brain, and fat are approximately proportional to the frequency f
and are in the range (0.5 × 10−6 to 2 × 10−6)f dB/cm. Typical values of the attenuation
coefficient α, sound velocity c, and density ρ0 are shown in Ishimaru (1997).

ULTRASOUND IN BLOOD
Extensive studies have been made on ultrasonic properties of blood. For the normal
frequency range of a few hundred kilohertz to 10 MHz used in biological media, the
wavelength is much greater than the size of red blood cells. Therefore the Rayleigh
formula for a sphere with the same volume as that of a red blood cell should give a
good approximation of the absorption and scattering characteristics. The scattering
amplitude f(̂0, ̂𝑖) is given by
f(̂0, ̂𝑖) = k2a3

where k = 2π∕λ, λ is the wavelength in the surrounding medium (plasma), a the
radius of the equivalent sphere, κe and ρe the adiabatic compressibility and density
of the red blood cell, respectively, κ and ρ are those of the plasma, and θ is the
angle between ̂0 and ̂𝑖. For a normal blood cell, the volume is 87 μm3, and the
equivalent radius a = 2.75 μm. The compressibility and density of a red blood cell
are κe = 34.1 × 10−12 cm2∕dyne and ρe = 1.092 g∕cm3 and those of plasma are
κ = 40.9 × 10−12 cm2∕dyne and ρe = 1.021 g∕cm3.

Using the values of κe, ρe, κ, ρ, and a, we get
σs = 0.47 × 10−16 f 4cm2,
(20.92)
where f is the frequency measured in megahertz. The backscattering cross section is
approximately given by σb ≅1.86σs.
The absorption cross section σa is proportional to the frequency and is given by

(20.93)
where Im designates the “imaginary part of.” The imaginary parts of κe, ρe, κ, and ρ are
not known. However, it is known that the absorption cross section σa is much greater
than the scattering cross section σs in the frequency range 0.1–10 MHz, and therefore
the attenuation through blood is mainly due to the absorption, and not the scattering.
It is also known that the attenuation of a plane wave in random scatterers is given by
ρσa nepers per unit distance (Np/cm). The attenuation constant is proportional to the
hematocrit H and the frequency f (in megahertz) and is approximately given by
α = (5 −7) × 10−2 Hf Np∕cm = 0.3 Hf dB∕cm.
(20.94)
Since α = ρσa = (H∕Ve)σa, we obtain the absorption cross section of a single ery-
throcyte
σa = 6 × 10−12 f cm2,
(20.95)
where f is measured in megahertz. The effect of viscosity of the plasma and the
erythrocyte on the scattering and absorption characteristics may be significant (Ahuja,
1970; Ishimaru, 1997).
The differential scattering cross section per unit volume of the blood is therefore
σ(̂0, ̂𝑖) = HfP(H)
Ve
|f(̂0, ̂𝑖)|2,
(20.96)
where H is the hematocrit (0.4 for human), Ve is the volume of the single cell (4πa3∕3),
and fP(H) is the packing factor. The Percus–Yevick packing factor for hard spheres
is often used as an approximation
fp(H) = (1 −H)4

CHAPTER 21
WAVES IN METAMATERIALS AND
PLASMON
There has been an increasing interest in the development of new materials whose
characteristics may not be found in nature. Metamaterials are an example of these
materials. Meta means “beyond” indicating the material is beyond those found in
nature. An example of metamaterials is artificial dielectrics, which have been devel-
oped and used since the 1940s. Artificial magnetic materials have magnetic properties
not found in nature even though the materials are nonmagnetic. Split-ring resonators
(SRRs) are a typical example. A man-made chiral material consisting of a collec-
tion of metal helices is another example. Another example that we will discuss
later is bianisotropic media. These metamaterials have a broad range of applications
including lenses, absorbers, antenna structures, composite materials, and frequency
selective surfaces.
In 1968, Veselago published a paper describing the electrodynamics of “substances
with simultaneously negative values of μ and ε” that showed some peculiar charac-
teristics of waves, even though no physical material or devices were found having
negative ε and μ until 1999, when Pendry and others proposed periodically stacked
SRRs at microwave frequencies which exhibit simultaneous negative ε and μ.
Since that time, many investigations have been reported on related topics of per-
fect lenses, and potential applications in lenses, absorbers, antennas, optical and
microwave components, and sensors. In this chapter, we discuss some of the funda-
mentals of metamaterials including transformation EM and cloaking. In this chapter,
we use the convention exp(−𝑖ωt) commonly used in optics and acoustics, rather than
exp(jωt) used in electrical engineering and by the IEEE, as there are many references

in optics, acoustics, and physics on this topic. Extensive literature have been pub-

Sihvola (2007), Engheta and Ziolkowski (2006), and Caloz and Itoh (2006).
21.1
REFRACTIVE INDEX n AND 𝛍–𝛆DIAGRAM
Most materials we encounter in practice have relative permittivity greater than one,
except plasma whose relative permittivity is less than one, and relative permeability
equal to one, except magnetic materials. Defining the relative permittivity and relative
permeability, we write
ε = ε
ε0
= ε′
r + 𝑖ε′′
r ,
μ = μ
μ0
= μ′
r + 𝑖μ′′
r .
(21.1)
For a linear passive isotropic medium, we have
ε′′
r = Im εr > 0,
μ′′
r = Im μr > 0.
(21.2)
The ordinary dielectric material has
1 < ε′
r < ∞,
μ′
r = 1
(21.3)
and plasma has ε′
r < 1, μ′
r = 1.
Note also that magnetic materials can be categorized by permeability as
μ′
r ≤1
diamagnetic,
μ′
r ≥1
paramagnetic,
(21.4)
μ′
r ≫1
ferromagnetic.
The ordinary materials shown above are indicated in Fig. 21.1.
If we extend the regions to outside the ordinary materials, we can in principle
cover all the regions of the μ′
r–ε′
r diagram. In particular, the region for simultaneously
μ′
r < 0 and ε′
r < 0, which Veselago noted is called negative index material (NIM), is
also called left-handed medium (LHM), negative index of refraction medium (NIR)
and double negative medium (DNG).
It should also be noted that the refractive index n is given by
n = √εrμr

Therefore, we need to choose the correct sign for the square root. The choice should
be made on the basis that with exp(−𝑖ωt) dependence (Fig. 21.2),

Let us also note that as stated in Section 2.8, Maxwell’s equations are unchanged
if we interchange ̄E, ̄H, ̄J, ̄Jm, ρ, ρm, and ε and μ to the new primed fields as shown
here.
̄E →̄H′
̄J →̄J′
m
ρ →ρ′
m
μ →ε′,
̄H →̄E′
Jm →−̄J′
ρm →−ρ′
ε →μ′.
(21.8)
This means that we can change μ and ε to μ′ and ε′ if we also change ̄E, ̄H, ̄J, and
ρ to the primed fields as shown in (21.8). Specifically, if we have TM solutions in the
unprimed system with μ and ε, then we also have TE solutions with μ′ and ε′ with
the above changes of the fields. This will be useful and important.
21.2
PLANE WAVES, ENERGY RELATIONS, AND GROUP VELOCITY
Let us consider the characteristics of a plane wave propagating in NIM. The wave
is propagating in the z direction and we assume that ̄E = Ex̂x and ̄H = Ĥy. We then
have
Ex = E0e𝑖k0nz
= E0e𝑖k0n′z−k0n′′z,
Hy = Ex
Z ,
Z = Z0
√
μ∕ε,
(21.9)
where n′ < 0 and k0n′ < 0 for NIM.

Noting that Re Z > 0, we have
Re

(21.11)
and therefore ̄S, is pointed in the ̂z direction.
However, ̄Kr = k0n′̂z is pointed in the (−̂z) direction. Therefore, the phase velocity
is in the direction (−̂z) opposite to the Poynting vector (̂z).

SPLIT-RING RESONATORS

NIM is known to be lossy and dispersive. Let us examine the time-averaged
stored energy. For a dispersive medium such as NIM, the stored energy is given by
(Section 2.5)
W = ε0
4
∂
∂ω(ωεr)|E|2 + μ0
4
∂
∂ω(ωμr)|H|2.
(21.12)
Note that if
∂
∂ω(ωεr) > 0
and
∂
∂ω(ωμr) > 0,
(21.13)
then W becomes positive.
If NIM were nondispersive, we would have
W = ε0
4 εr|E|2 + μ0
4 μr|H|2.
(21.14)
This becomes negative if εr < 0 and μr < 0 and is not physical.
Group index of refraction for lossless NIM with εr < 0 and μr < 0 is given by
ng = ∂
∂ω(ωn) = c

(21.15)
For NIM, n < 0, εr < 0, μr < 0, ∂
∂ω(ωεr) > 0, and ∂
∂ω(ωμr) > 0, therefore
ng > 0
and
vg > 0.
(21.16)
21.3
SPLIT-RING RESONATORS
As we already discussed, Veselago’s investigation of materials with simultaneously
negative values of ε and μ in 1968 did not attract much attention because no material
existed with these characteristics at that time. This changed when Pendry showed in
1999 that it is possible to construct such materials. Smith and others (2000, 2004)
conducted extensive studies on metamaterials, and a comprehensive overview was
given by Sihvola (2007).
The SRR proposed by Pendry and others is a periodic structure with a unit cell
of characteristic dimension (spacing) which is much smaller than a wavelength and
therefore it can be regarded as a homogenous medium. This requires some averaging
process, which is called “homogenization.” It has effective permittivity and perme-
ability that are both negative. SRR has been studied (Hardy, 1981) for use in magnetic

resonant frequency is proportional to (gap spacing∕width)1∕2 = (t∕w)1∕2.
SRRs for metamaterials consist of a three-dimensional periodic structure of flat
disks of split ring (Fig. 21.3). Its permittivity and permeability have resonance char-
acteristics sketched in Fig. 21.4, which was calculated numerically (Ishimaru et al.,
2003). The figure shows the resonant frequency slightly under 5 GHz. Note that both
μzz and εxx are negative in the frequency range slightly above the resonant frequency,
and the refractive index n = (εyy∕μzz)1∕2 is also negative. This also shows that the
medium is anisotropic, as will be discussed in Section 21.4.
The key quantity is the resonance frequency. Pendry gave an approximate formula

This is near the numerically calculated value of Fig. 21.4. Shamonin and others (2004)
studied equivalent circuits of a single split resonator and the SRR consisting of the
series inductances for outer and inner rings, and the mutual inductance between
rings, the gap capacitances, the capacitances between rings, and emf induced in
the inner and outer rings. The resonant frequency is that of an LC circuit and the
capacitance includes the two gap capacitances. These circuit representations are
useful to understand the physical interpretation of the SRRs.
It is possible to express the dispersive characteristics of the refractive index n(ω)
taking into account the group refractive index. Note that the behavior of n(ω) near ω0
is given by

GENERALIZED CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONS
FOR METAMATERIALS
SRRs are usually studied using the plane of the rings as the x–y plane and the z-
axis is perpendicular to the plane of the ring. However, it is clear that depending on
the polarization of the incident wave, SRR behaves differently indicating that it is
anisotropic. Therefore, it should be clear that the permittivity and the permeability
must be 3 × 3 matrices. More generally, as was discussed in Section 8.22, there are
couplings between electric and magnetic field excitations and responses, as exhibited
in chiral materials. These couplings are also expressed in 3 × 3 matrices. Thus we
have a 6 × 6 matrix.
[ ̄D
̄B
]
=
[
̄̄ε
̄̄ξ
̄̄ζ
̄̄μ
] [ ̄E
̄H
]
,
(21.21)
where ̄D, ̄B, ̄E, and ̄H are 3 × 1 matrices and ̄̄ε, ̄̄ξ, ̄̄ζ, and ̄̄μ are 3 × 3 matrices. This is
the general constitutive relation of bianisotropic medium.
There are some fundamental relations among these matrices (Weiglhofer, 1995,
2002). The bianisotropic nongyrotropic mediums satisfy the following reciprocity
relations (Kong 1986, 1972):
[̄̄ε]t = [̄̄ε] ,
[̄̄μ]t = [̄̄μ] ,
(21.22)
[̄̄ζ
]t
= −
[̄̄ζ
]
,
where t denotes transpose.

GENERALIZED CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONS FOR METAMATERIALS
693
It is also noted that to be compatible with Maxwell’s equations, the following
consistency constraint must hold (Kong, 1986):
Trace
([̄̄ξ
] [̄̄μ] + [̄̄μ]−1 [̄̄ζ
])
= 0.
(21.23)
The constitutive relations given in (21.21) are called the E–H (or Tellegen) represen-
tations.
However, physically ̄E and ̄B are the fundamental fields and ̄D and ̄H are the
responses. Thus, the following E–B (or Boys–Post) representation is more physically
appropriate.
[ ̄D
̄H
]
=
[ ̄̄εp
̄̄αp
̄̄βp
̄̄μ−1
p
] [ ̄E
̄B
]
(21.24)
These two representations (21.21) and (21.24) are equivalent for a linear medium,
and related through the following:
̄̄ε = ̄̄εp −̄̄αp ̄̄μp ̄̄βp,
̄̄μ = ̄̄μp,
̄̄ξ = ̄̄αp ̄̄μp,
̄̄ζ = −̄̄μp ̄̄βp.
(21.25)
The E–H representation (21.21) is commonly used in most of the literature. It is
convenient because Maxwell’s equations appear symmetric and boundary conditions
are generally given in terms of ̄E and ̄H. Note, however, that even though the E–H
representation is conventional, the E–B representation (21.24) is physically correct.
Let us now derive the constitutive relations for metamaterials consisting of a three-
dimensional array of nonmagnetic inclusions (Fig. 21.3). As was discussed in Section
2.3, in isotropic and anisotropic media, we have
̄D = ε0 ̄E + ̄P,
̄P = χeε0 ̄E,
̄B = μ0( ̄H + ̄M),
̄M = χm ̄H,
(21.26)
where ̄P and ̄M are the electric and magnetic polarizations respectively, and χe and χm
are the electric and magnetic susceptibilities. In this section, we discuss how (21.26)
is generalized for metamaterials.
The inclusions shown in Fig. 21.3 are small in size in wavelength. The spacings are
also much smaller than a wavelength, generally no more than 0.1λ and the inclusions
are much smaller than the spacing. Under these conditions, the medium can be
considered homogeneous and the Lorentz theory applies (Collin, 1991; Ishimaru
www.ebook3000.com

694
WAVES IN METAMATERIALS AND PLASMON
et al., 2003). Consistent with the Lorentz theory, we assume that under the influence
of an electromagnetic field, the inclusions produce electric and magnetic dipoles.
Using the E–H representation, we have in general
̄D = ε0 ̄E + ̄P( ̄E, ̄H),
̄B = μ0 ̄H + μ0 ̄M( ̄E, ̄H),
(21.27)
where electric and magnetic polarizations ̄P and ̄M are produced by ̄E and ̄H. Each
inclusion is acted upon by the effective field ( ̄Ee, ̄He) to produce the electric ̄p and
magnetic ̄m dipoles.
̄P and ̄M are then given by
̄P = N ̄p,
̄M = N ̄m,
(21.28)
where N = (abc)−1 is the number of inclusions per unit volume.
We can express ̄p and ̄m using the 6 × 6 generalized polarizability matrix [̄̄α].
[ ̄P
̄M
]
= N
[ ̄p
̄m

= N [̄̄α] [ ̄EēHe
]
,
where
[̄̄α] =
[ ̄̄αee
̄̄αem
̄̄αme
̄̄αmm
]
.
(21.29)
Note that in Section 8.1, we used ̄E′ = ̄E + ̄Ep, where ̄E′ is the local field, which is
the same as ̄Ee, ̄E is the external applied field, and ̄Ep is the field produced by all the
dipoles surrounding the dipole under consideration. ̄Ep is the same as ̄E𝑖(interaction
field) in Section 21.5.
Here in this section we generalize ̄E′ = ̄E + ̄Ep and write the local field ( ̄El, ̄Hl).

where
[ ̄̄C

is the 6 × 6 matrix and is called the interaction constant matrix.

(21.31)

We substitute this into (21.29) and noting

(21.33)
where ̄U is the 3 × 3 unit matrix.
That is the generalization of the Lorentz–Lorenz formula or Clausius–Mossotti
formula (see Section 8.1).
The 6 × 6 interaction matrix [C] has been obtained (Collin, 1991; Ishimaru et al.,
2003) and depends on the spacings in the x, y, and z directions. For a three-dimensional
array of inclusions of electric and magnetic dipoles, the interaction matrix is given
by

The polarizability matrix [̄̄α] in (21.29) can be expressed in terms of the currents
induced in the inclusions. The electric and magnetic dipoles ̄p and ̄m can be expressed
by the electric currents ̄Je and ̄Jm when the local electric and magnetic fields are ̄El
and ̄Hl, respectively (Jackson, 1962).
[ ̄p

= [̄̄α] [ ̄El̄Hl

̄Jm,
̄̄αme = ∫dv ̄r
2 × ̄Je,
̄̄αmm = ∫dv ̄r
2 × ̄Jm.
̄̄αee is a 3 × 3 matrix, and ̄Je is also a 3 × 3 matrix. The first column is the current
density in the x, y, and z directions for the x component of the effective field ̄El and
therefore the unit is (A∕m2)∕(V∕m). Similarly ̄Jm has the unit of (A∕m2)∕(A∕m).
Other components of ̄̄αem, ̄̄αme, and
̄̄
αmm can be similarly defined.
As a simple example, consider an array of spherical inclusions of radius a0 in a
cubic lattice; we get (Section 8.1)
̄̄αee = 3(εr −1)V
εr + 2
,
V = 1
N = 4πa0

(21.37)
where N is the number of inclusions per unit volume, and f = NV is the fractional

f = NV.
(21.38)
This is the Maxwell–Garnett mixing formula (Section 8.6).

Similarly, for a spherical inclusion, the lowest order electric field inside the sphere
in the uniform effective field H0̂z is pointed in the ϕ direction and noting
(πρ2)(+𝑖ω)μ0H0 = 2πρEϕ,
(21.39)
we get
̄Eϕ = (+𝑖ωμ0H0)ρ

The current ̄Jm and αmm are therefore

SPACE–TIME WAVE PACKET INCIDENT ON DISPERSIVE
METAMATERIAL AND NEGATIVE REFRACTION
We have already noted that NIM is generally dispersive and lossy. If a wave is incident
upon a dispersive lossy medium, the wave is reflected and refracted. If the medium
is NIM, then the angle of refraction can be negative according to Snell’s law.

where n1 and θ1 are the refractive index and the angle of incidence in the first medium,
and n2 and θ2 are those of the second medium. If n2 is negative, then θ2 < 0 according
to (21.43). This is called “negative refraction” (Fig. 21.5).
The negative refraction and Snell’s law are normally used for a plane wave incident
on a surface. Does this also apply to the incident wave such as a beam or a wave
packet? How does the dispersive medium affect the negative refraction? To answer
these questions, we need to study a space–time incident wave on a dispersive medium.
Let us consider a Gaussian wave packet incident upon a half space of dispersive
medium including NIM. We first consider the case where −(π∕2) < θ2 < (π∕2). In
later sections, we examine the cases where θ1 is greater than the critical angle θc.
sin θc = n2
n1
.
(21.44)
This gives rise to the Goos–Hanchen shift (Section 6.7) and the lateral wave
(Section 15.8). For n2 < 0, they become the “negative” Goos–Hanchen shift and the
“backward” lateral waves which will be discussed later. For this section, we limit
ourselves to the case |θ2| < (π∕2).
We consider the two-dimensional problem with TM polarization. The incident
Gaussian wave packet using time dependence exp(−𝑖ωt) is given by
Hy(x, z, t) = Re {ψ𝑖(x, z, t)},
ψ𝑖= exp

(kz1∕ε1) + (kz2∕ε2).
(21.49)
The evaluation of (21.48) and (21.49) can be done numerically. However, it is
more instructive to obtain the analytical solutions.
The analytical solutions can be obtained by using asymptotic solutions and the
method of steepest descent. We first note that kz2 can be expressed using the first-order
terms of the expansion in kx and ω about the stationary positions kx0 and ω0.

slowly varying functions of k0 and ω and therefore we approximate
T(kx, ω) ≈T(kx0, ω0),
R(kx, ω) ≈R(kx0, ω0).
(21.51)
Under these assumptions, we can perform the integration in (21.48) and (21.49) and
obtain

The factors in (21.52) give detailed physical significance and wave behavior. The
phase factor exp(𝑖ϕ) indicates that the phase progresses in the direction of θ2 with
the phase velocity of vp = (c∕n). Note that in the direction of θ2, z = r cos θ2 and
x = r sin θ2, and ϕ becomes
ϕ = knr −ω0t.
Clearly this is the case for NIM. The amplitude variation is given by Fb. The peak
of the Gaussian wave packet moves in the direction of θ2, which means that in NIM,
the wave packet moves in the direction of the negative refraction given by θ2. The
velocity of the wave packet is given by Fa. In the direction of the negative refraction,
̄r = r [(sin θ2)̂x + (cos θ2)̂z] and if we substitute this in Fa, we get the velocity of the
packet equal to the group velocity vg. Thus the phase velocity vp and vg are pointed
in opposite directions. Numerical calculations showing the phase velocity and the
group velocity are presented in Ishimaru (2005).

with the boundary condition that Hy and (1∕ε) (∂∕∂z) Hy are continuous at z = 0. The
magnetic line current Im is normalized with −jωε𝑖Im = 1.

T(kx) = (2Z1)∕(Z1 + Z2),
Z𝑖= (kz𝑖∕ωε𝑖), 𝑖= 1 and 2.
Let us now consider the surface waves. The pole for the surface wave is obtained
by setting the denominator of the reflection coefficient to zero. We have
Z1 + Z2 = 0
(21.55)
From this we get
kz1
ε1

kxp = k1S,
S2 = ε2 −n2
ε2 −1 ,
ε = ε2

n = n2

.
(21.57)
Note that (21.56) gives the pole applicable to the surface wave pole as well as the
Zenneck wave pole. The location of the pole given in (21.57) can be examined in the
μ′–ε′diagram where μ′ and ε′ are the real part of μ and ε (Fig. 21.1). Assuming that
the imaginary parts of μ and ε are negligibly small, and therefore S is real, we can
examine S in the μ′–ε′ plane.
If S2 > 1, forward and backward surface waves can exist. If 0 < S2 < 1, there may
be a Zenneck wave, and if S2 < 0, the wave decays exponentially along the surface.
When S2 > 1, for a surface wave to exist, the pole must be in the proper Riemann
surface. Depending on the imaginary part of kz1 and kz2, we can have four cases,

BACKWARD LATERAL WAVES AND BACKWARD SURFACE WAVES

where the poles are located in the kx complex plane. They are called the Riemann
surfaces (Appendix 15.A).
Riemann surface I:
Im(kz1) < 0, Im(kz2) < 0,
Riemann surface II:
Im(kz1) > 0, Im(kz2) < 0,
Riemann surface III: Im(kz1) < 0, Im(kz2) > 0,
Riemann surface IV: Im(kz1) > 0, Im(kz2) > 0.
In Riemann surface I, the wave attenuates as |z| →∞because both Im(kz1) and
Im(kz2) are negative. Therefore this is called the “proper Riemann” surface. The
surface wave exists if the pole is on Riemann surface I. To verify that the pole is
in the proper Riemann surface with Im(kz1) < 0, we need to make sure to satisfy
(21.56). To verify this, we first obtain kz2 =
√
k2
2 −k2
xp and take the square root such
that Im(kz2) < 0. This ensures that the pole is in Riemann surface I or II. Then we
calculate kz1 from (21.56) and determine whether Im(kz1) < 0. If so, the pole is in
Riemann surface I. Otherwise it is in Riemann surface II. As we see in Fig. 21.8, the
forward surface wave and the backward surface wave exist in the regions denoted by
SW+ and SW−.
As we see in Fig. 21.8, there is a small region where the backward surface wave
SW−exists. The phase velocity is pointed in the negative x direction as shown in
Fig. 21.9.
The Poynting vector in air is pointed in the same direction as the phase velocity,
but is pointed in the opposite direction in medium 2 (NIM).

In the region where 0 < n < 1, the conventional lateral wave can exist as shown in
Section 15.8. If −1 < n < 0, then the backward lateral wave can exist. In Fig. 21.10,
we show the conventional and the backward lateral waves. Note that for a backward
lateral wave, the phase velocity vp is negative and the branch point at kx2 = k0n is
located in the third quadrant of the kx plane.
The branch cut integration gives rise to the lateral wave pointed in the negative
direction as shown in Fig. 21.10a. If a wave packet is incident as shown in Fig. 21.10b,
the wave packet in the medium 2 propagates with group velocity vg in the x direction
radiating the pulse in the negative direction as shown. This is obtained from Eqs.
(21.48) and (21.49) in Section 21.5 and numerically calculating the integral. Figure
21.10c shows the branch cut for the complex kx plane.
21.7
NEGATIVE GOOS–HANCHEN SHIFT
We have already discussed the “positive” Goos–Hanchen shift in Section 6.7. This
shift occurs when the beam is incident from medium 1 with ε1, μ1, and n1 to medium
2 with ε2, μ2, and n2 with the incident angle that causes the total reflection. This
requires that

where Ur0 is identical to the beam wave originated from the image source (see Section
6.7). The shift is given by ϕ′(β0).
Now we examine the shift ϕ′(β0) for all cases in the μ–ε diagram.
For s-polarization, we have

Rp = (q1∕ε1) + j(α2∕ε2)

A point delta function source at A emits waves that are focused to a delta

Thus, this lens with n = −1 is called the “super resolution.”
21.8
PERFECT LENS, SUBWAVELENGTH FOCUSING, AND
EVANESCENT WAVES
As stated by Pendry in 2000, a slab of NIM with n = −1 can focus waves from a
delta function point source to a delta function point image (Fig. 21.13). An ordinary
lens cannot focus to a size less than the order of a wavelength. Therefore an n = −1
slab lens which can focus to a delta function image is called the “perfect lens” with
“super resolution.”
This is, of course, a mathematical idealization that does not exist. It is known that
the mathematical formulations of any physical problem must be properly posed. This
requires that the solution must satisfy three conditions: (1) uniqueness, (2) existence,
and (3) it must depend continuously on the variation of the physical parameters. The
slab with n = −1 is not properly posed and therefore the super resolution does not
exist. We need to start with ε = −1 + δε and μ = −1 + δμ. We then find, instead of
super resolution, subwavelength focusing.
As an example, consider a line magnetic source in front of the slab (Fig. 21.14).
The magnetic field Hy for z > d2 is given by
(

∂x2 + ∂2

Hy = jωε0Imδ(x)δ(z + d1)

where k1 = k0(n = 1), and k2 = k0n, and we normalize Im so that −jωε0Im = 1. The
solution is given in Fourier representation. For z > d2, we have

and ε = −ε0. Therefore, Z2 = −Z1, M = −1, and kz2 = (k2

becomes
T(kX) = exp(+jkz1dz).

r = [(z + d1 −2d2)2 + x2] ,
(21.74)

the first kind.
Hy(x, z) = −j1
4H0
(1)(k |r|).
(21.75)
This means that near x = 0, z = 2d2 −d1, the field behaves as an incoming wave for
z < 2d2 −d1 focused on a point and diverges for z > 2d2 −d1. All of these are simply
a mathematical idealization that does not exist in physical problems. What is more
important and useful is the question of what happens if the refractive index deviates
from −1. Let us examine this. If n deviates from −1, and ε and μ deviate from −ε0
and −μ0, M deviates from −1. We write this as
M →−1 + δ.
(21.76)
The transmission coefficient T becomes
T =
2 exp(−jkz2d2)
δ + exp(−j2kz2d2)(2 −δ).
(21.77)
By noting n2 = 1 + δn,μ2 = −1 + δμ, and ε2 = −1 + δε, we can examine M = −1 + δ
carefully. We then get δ in terms of δn, δμ, and δε. Detailed examination will show
that the first order of δn, δμ, and δε cancel out and δ is proportional to the second-order

The spectrum ̄Hy has a general shape shown in Fig. 21.15. For kx →0, | ̄Hy| is nearly
constant up to a break point kp. Beyond kp, it decreases exponentially.
Near k0 and kp, there may be some variations. The integral over kx can be domi-
nated by the portion of the spectrum for kx = 0 to kp and shows sinusoidal behavior
proportional to sin(kpx)∕(kpx), and thus the spot size kp is approximately given by
kpxp ≃π. This gives the distance to the first minimum

The spot size xp given by (21.79) shows that kp is larger than a wavelength for small

Let us look at the spectrum shown in Fig. 21.15 for kx < k0, the propagation
constant kz1 = (k2
0 −k2
x)1∕2 is real and the wave is propagating with a real wave num-
ber. If kx > k0, kz1 = (k2

attenuating. This is called the “evanescent wave” and is the same as the cut-off mode

(see Section 4.6). Also note that for n = −1, the evanescent wave does not attenuate,
and the spectrum is constant for all k, and the spot size is infinitely small. This is an
ideal, but an unphysical case. When n = −1 + δ, the evanescent wave is attenuated
exponentially for kx > kp, giving a finite spot size.

BREWSTER’S ANGLE IN NIM AND ACOUSTIC
BREWSTER’S ANGLE
As stated in Section 3.6, Brewster’s angle is defined as the angle of a p-polarized
wave incident on the plane interface between two media, for which the reflection
becomes zero. If the second medium is lossy, the reflection becomes a minimum at
Brewster’s angle. In Sections 3.9 and 15.1, the Zenneck wave was shown as the wave
propagating over the earth’s surface. Therefore, it appears that Brewster’s angle and
Zenneck wave are two different wave phenomena. However, mathematically these
are closely related as will be shown below.
Let us consider an interface between two media. In p-polarization, the reflection
coefficient for a plane wave incidence is given by
Rp(kx) = (kz1ε1) −(kz2∕ε2)
(kz1∕ε1) + (kz2∕ε2),
where
kz1 =
√
k2
1 −k2
x,
kz2 =
√

(21.81)
For a plane wave incidence at θ𝑖, kx = k1 sin θ𝑖. Therefore, Brewster’s angle is
obtained by the zero of the reflection coefficient.

ε2
= 0.
(21.82)
On the other hand, Zenneck wave is obtained when the denominator is zero.

(21.83)
If medium 1 is free space, we can normalize ε and μ and write

μ = (μ2∕μ0),
kz1 = k0

By taking the square of both sides, we get

From this, we get Brewster’s angle θb for p-polarization.
Sb = sin θb =
[ε2 −με

For ordinary material with μ = 1, Sb is reduced to the well-known formula for

(21.87)
Note that Brewster’s angle (21.86) when μ ≠1 is different from that of free space
(21.87).
Up to this point, we only considered p-polarization. For ordinary materials with
μ = 1, there is no Brewster’s angle for s-polarization. However, there is Brew-
ster’s angle for p-polarization. The reflection coefficient (21.81) can be written for
s-polarization
Rs = (kz1μ1) −(kz2∕μ2)
(kz1∕μ1) + (kz2∕μ2).
(21.88)
As we noted previously in (21.8), all wave characteristics in the p-polarization (TM)
and the s-polarization (TE) are symmetric with the following change: ε and μ (TM) →
μ and ε (TE).
Therefore Brewster’s angle for s-polarization (TE) is given by (21.86) by exchang-
ing ε and μ.
Sb =
[μ2 −με

.
(21.89)
Brewster’s angle when the medium is lossless is real and given by
0 < Sb

(21.90)
For p-polarization, this is shown in shaded areas in Fig. 21.16, and for s-polarization,
it is shown in Fig. 21.17. Note that μ and ε in Fig. 21.16 are changed to ε and μ in

A plane wave is incident from the medium with ρ0 and k0 to the plane interface

The plane wave is incident on the plane interface between the medium (μ0,ε0) and
the medium (μ, ε). Noting the correspondence
μ = (ρ∕ρ0),
ε = (k∕k0),
we see that the s-polarization corresponds to the acoustic wave. The difference is
that while μ and ε can be −∞to +∞, ρ and k can only be positive. Thus we have

TRANSFORMATION ELECTROMAGNETICS AND
INVISIBLE CLOAK
Maxwell’s equations are form invariant under coordinate transformations. This means
that the form of Maxwell’s equations is valid in any arbitrary spatial coordinate
systems. We normally deal with the simplest coordinate systems such as Cartesian
rectangular or cylindrical or spherical systems. However, Maxwell’s equations hold
in other coordinate systems. For example, Maxwell’s equations hold in a system
(x, y, z) and in transformed system (x′, y′, z′). It is more convenient to write (x1, x2, x3)
for (x, y, z) and (x′
1, x′
2, x′
3) for (x′, y′, z′) since we may be dealing with any other
coordinate system. The 3 × 3 transformation matrix A is given by

.
(21.94)
Under this transformation, the material property of permittivity ε and permeability
μ are changed to inhomogeneous and anisotropic. If the original space is free space,
then the transformed medium has the relative permittivity matrix and the relative
permeability matrix, ̄̄εr and ̄̄μr given by
̄̄εr = ̄̄μr = AAT
det A,
det A = determinant of A.
(21.95)
Thus, the transformed medium is inhomogeneous and anisotropic and ̄̄εr and ̄̄μr are
the same and symmetric. This also means that because ̄̄εr = ̄̄μr, the impedance of
free space is not changed in this transformed space. Thus, the transformed medium
appears as anisotropic impedance matched media.
The derivation of (21.94) can be obtained by expressing Maxwell’s equations in
the transformed coordinate and identifying the constitutive equations (Leonhardt and
Philbin, 2010; Pendry et al., 2006). Maxwell’s equations in free space are
∇× ̄E = −jωμ0 ̄H,
∇× ̄H = +jωε0 ̄E,

of the distance ds given by

This is specific to the cylindrical system. For a more complicate coordinate system,
it requires the use of a “metric tensor.”

the object is cloaked in this cylindrical space.

WAVES IN METAMATERIALS AND PLASMON
In the above, the possibility of making material to produce cloaking is noted. How-
ever, it requires that material with an inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium with
specified ̄̄ε = ̄̄μ needs to be produced. Even though advances in metamaterials offer
some possibilities, much more theoretical and experimental work is needed to realize
possible cloaking materials and devices. Transformation electromagnetics may also
be used for reshaping objects in scattering and miniaturizing waveguides (Ozgun and
Kuzuoglu, 2010) and for flat focusing lenses, wave collimators, polarization splitters
and rotators and beam benders (Kwon and Werner, 2010).
Another important point that needs to be considered is that mathematically, coor-
dinate transformation is based on the “differential geometry,” the theory of curves and
surfaces, vector and tensor analysis, which are clearly beyond the scope of this book
(Leonhardt and Philbin, 2010). It is, however, noted that in transforming from the
original system (x1, x2, x3) to the transformed space (x′
1, x′
2, x′

relations should be noted:

21.11
SURFACE FLATTENING COORDINATE TRANSFORM
In Section 21.10, we discussed “transformation electromagnetics.” By transforming
the coordinate system from (x, y, z) to the other coordinate system (x′, y′, z′), it is
possible to transform the original space to the transformed space with the material
property of ε and μ given in (21.95). If the original space is free space, the transformed
medium is inhomogeneous and anisotropic, and it is possible to produce a cloaking.
This interesting possibility created much interest. However, it should be noted that
this requires the creation of new material such as metamaterial with specific inho-
mogeneous and anisotropic ε and μ. Though it is interesting, it has not been proven
possible to physically produce such metamaterials.
In this section, we discuss a new and different application of the coordinate
transformation, not for producing a new material, but for using the transformation
to solve a wave scattering problem. We consider a wave propagating over a rough
surface, such as ocean waves. The surface is rough and therefore the surface height is
random. If we can transform the rough surface to a flat surface, then it may be possible
to solve this scattering problem as a problem with a flat boundary. However, as we
noted in Section 21.10, if the boundary becomes flat, then the medium becomes
inhomogeneous and anisotropic, transforming a rough surface problem with free
space above, to a flat surface problem with a complicated medium.

SURFACE FLATTENING COORDINATE TRANSFORM
721
This approach called “surface flattening transform” has been proposed by Tappert
(1979) and studied by Abarbanel (1998), Yeh (2001), Donohue (2000), and Wu
(2005) using the path integral approach. In this section, we discuss key points of the
flattening transform. The surface height is given by ζ(x, y) and the coordinate system
(x, y, z) is now transformed to (x′, y′, z′).
x′ = x,
y′ = y,
(21.109)
z′ = z −ζ(x, y).
The wave equation is then transformed by using the coordinate transformation. The
transformation matrix A in (21.93) is then given by
A =
⎡

Note that AT is the transpose of A and

ε0 and

Maxwell’s equations are form invariant under coordinate transformation. This means
that we can write Maxwell’s equations in (x, y, z) and (x′, y′, z′) in the same form. We
have
∇× ̄E = 𝑖ωμ0 ̄H
∇′ × ̄E′ = 𝑖ω̄̄μ ̄H′
∇× ̄H = −𝑖ωε0 ̄E
⇒
∇′ × ̄H′ = −𝑖ω̄̄ε ̄E′
∇× ∇× ̄E = ω2μ0ε0 ̄E
∇′ × (̄̄μ)−1∇′ × ̄E′ = ω2̄̄ε ̄E′

(21.112)
Note that in (x′, y′, z′) coordinates, impedance is not changed giving “anisotropic
impedance matched media.” By solving Maxwell’s equation on the right side of
(21.111), we can solve the problem in free space with a rough surface.

WAVES IN METAMATERIALS AND PLASMON
Let us consider a scalar (acoustic) wave scattering by a rough surface. We use the
coordinate transformation (21.108). Consider a scalar wave equation in free space
above a rough surface with Dirichlet boundary condition.
(∇2 + k2)G = −δ(x −x0)δ(y −y0)δ(z −z0).
(21.113)
The transformation from the original space (x, y, z) to the transformed space (x′, y′, z′)
with a flat surface can be done by using the coordinate transformation.

(21.117)
The boundary condition is
G = 0

Note that F represents the inhomogeneous medium containing the slope ∇ζ, the
radius of the curvature ∇2ζ, and the magnitude of the slope |∇ζ|2.
This problem has been studied for rough surfaces, and imaging of objects near
surface has been studied using the time-reversal technique (Ishimaru et al., 2013).

CHAPTER 22
TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING
The idea of time-reversal (TR) can be traced to the phase-conjugate mirror and
retroreflectance. It is also called the “time-reversal mirror (TRM)” from a localized
source incident on a TMR as reflected back to the original source. This is equivalent to
producing a time-reversed field at the phase-conjugate mirror, and the reflected field
propagates back to focus on the original source. In this back propagation process, the
time-reversed field traces back through the original path even though the path may
include complicated multiscattering media. The retrodirective array at microwave
exhibits similar behavior.
The optical phase conjugation and microwave retrodirective array are mostly for
narrow band operation where the time reversal is achieved by the phase conjugation.
In acoustics, however, the waves are often broadband and it may be necessary to
consider the time reversal for wide-band pulse operation. In this section, we give
fundamental theories of the TRM, conjugate mirror, and space–time time-reversal
focused imaging. We will discuss d´ecomposition de l’op´erateur de retournement tem-
porel (DORT), singular value decomposition (SVD) and super resolution as applied
to time-reversal imaging, TR-MUSIC (multiple signal classification), and related
beam former and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. We will also include the
use of SVD for communication in random media. Extensive discussions have been
presented on time reversal. Basic theories have been developed by Fink and Prada
(1994, 2003, 1997, 1995, 1996, 2000), Devaney (2003, 2005, 2005, 2012), Yavuz
and Teixeira (2008, 2006), Borcea, Papanicolaou et al. (2002), and Ishimaru et al.
(2012).

A point source at ̄rt emits a pulse which is received by a receiver located at
̄r𝑖, time reversed, and backpropagated into the same medium and observed at the point ̄rs. The
plane at z = 0 is called “time-reversal mirror” or “phase-conjugate mirror.”
22.1
TIME-REVERSAL MIRROR IN FREE SPACE
Let us first consider the problem shown in Fig. 22.1. A pulse is emitted by a point
source located at ̄rt. This is received by the array element located at ̄r𝑖. This received
pulse is time reversed and backpropagated into the same medium and observed at the
point ̄rs. The emitted pulse ft(t) and its spectrum U(ω) are given by
ft(t) = 1
2π ∫U(ω)exp(−𝑖ωt)dω,
U(ω) = ∫ft(t)exp(+𝑖ωt)dt.
(22.1)
This pulse is propagated to ̄r𝑖and is received at ̄r𝑖.
f(̄r𝑖, t) = 1
2π ∫G𝑖(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω)U(ω)exp(−𝑖ωt)dω,
(22.2)
where G𝑖is Green’s function observed at ̄r𝑖due to a point source at ̄rt.
This pulse f(̄r𝑖, t) is now time reversed. The time-reversed pulse is given by
fTR(̄r𝑖, t) = f(̄r𝑖, −t)
= 1
2π ∫G𝑖(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω)U(ω)e+𝑖ωtdω.
(22.3)

TIME-REVERSAL MIRROR IN FREE SPACE
725
The spectrum FTR of the time-reversed pulse fTR is then given by
FTR(̄r𝑖, ω) = ∫fTR(̄r𝑖, t)e+𝑖ωtdt
= 1
2π ∫[G𝑖(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω′)U(ω′)e+𝑖ω′tdω′]e+𝑖ωtdt,
(22.4)
where we used ω′ to differentiate ω in (22.3) and ω in (22.4).
Noting that
∫e+𝑖(ω′+ω)tdω = 2πδ(ω′ + ω),
we get
FTR(̄r𝑖, ω) = G𝑖(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, −ω)U(−ω)
= G∗
𝑖(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω)U∗(ω).
(22.5)
Note that the Fourier spectrum of G𝑖(−ω) and U(−ω) evaluated at (−ω) is equal to
the complex conjugates G∗
𝑖(ω) and U∗(ω).
The time-reversed pulse at ̄r𝑖then propagates to ̄rs, and the observed pulse at ̄rs is
given by
fTR(̄rs, ̄r𝑖, t) = 1
2π ∫G𝑖(̄rs, ̄r𝑖, ω)G∗
𝑖(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω)U∗(ω)e−𝑖ωtdω.
(22.6)
This is the final expression for the observed pulse at ̄rs, due to the pulse emitted at ̄rt,
and time reversed at ̄r𝑖. Note that G𝑖(̄rs, ̄r𝑖, ω) is Green’s function from ̄r𝑖to ̄rs.
The total pulse at ̄rs is then given by the sum of contributions from all elements at
̄r𝑖.
fTR(̄rs, t) =
∑
𝑖
fTR(̄rs, ̄r𝑖, t).
(22.7)
This is the general formula for the time-reversal field at ̄rs when the TRM is illumi-
nated by a source located at ̄rt. This formula (22.7) can be compactly expressed using
the following matrices.
We let the matrix g represent all the waves incident at ̄r𝑖(i = 1, 2, …, N) due to a
source at ̄rt.
g = [G1
G2
⋯
GN]T,
(22.8)
where G𝑖= G𝑖(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω) and [ ]T is the transposed matrix.

TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING
We let
gs = [Gs1
Gs2
⋯
GsN]T,
(22.9)
where Gs𝑖= Gs𝑖(̄rs, ̄r𝑖, ω).
Note that G𝑖and Gs𝑖are Green’s functions.
Using these matrix representations, we write (22.7) in the following compact
matrix form:
fTR(̄rs, t) =
∑
𝑖
1
2π ∫gT
s g∗U∗e−𝑖ωtdω.
(22.10)
This matrix form will be used in the subsequent sections.
As an example, we take a Gaussian modulated pulse.

4π𝓁𝑖
,
Gs𝑖(̄rs, ̄r𝑖, ω) = exp(𝑖k𝓁s𝑖)
4π𝓁s𝑖
,
k = ω
C.
(22.12)
Substituting (22.11) and (22.12) in (22.6) and (22.7) and performing integration with
respect to ω, we get the observed pulse at ̄rs.
fTR(̄rs, t) =
∑

(22.13)

TIME-REVERSAL MIRROR IN FREE SPACE
727
Note that the time of travel for the pulse from ̄rt to ̄r𝑖is (𝓁𝑖∕c) which is time reversed
to become −(𝓁𝑖∕c). And the time of travel from ̄r𝑖to ̄rs is (𝓁s𝑖∕c). Therefore t = 0
corresponds to the time when the time-reversed pulse is observed when the pulse
center is at the source point ̄rs = ̄rt(𝓁s𝑖= 𝓁𝑖).
In order to examine the time-reversal pulse (22.13), let us consider a narrow band
pulse. We can then ignore the second term of the exponent with (Δω∕ω)2 and note
that (1∕𝓁𝑖) and (1∕𝓁s𝑖) can be approximated by 1∕L.
In the plane of z = L, we can approximate 𝓁s𝑖and 𝓁𝑖by
𝓁s𝑖= L + (x −x𝑖)2

𝓁𝑖= L +

(22.14)

(x2 −2xx𝑖

(22.15)

This gives the transverse spot size of

Nd = λo(L∕a).
(22.18)
As expected, λo is the wavelength at the carrier frequency, and a = Nd is the total
size of the aperture.
The axial spot size can be obtained approximately from (22.13). Note that on axis,
using 𝓁𝑖= L, 𝓁s𝑖= L + Δz, and t = 0, we get the axial spot size Δ.

The plane at z = 0 is called the “time-reversal mirror” or the “phase-conjugate
mirror,” because the wave incident on a point in the plane is time reversed and
reemitted into the same medium. The spectrum of the time-reversed pulse is the
complex conjugate of the incident pulse. The transverse spot size at the origin is the
same as that of the wave from an aperture at the TRM focused on the pulse origin,
and the axial spot size is given by the bandwidth of the pulse (Fig. 22.2).

time-reversed pulse, the pulse B arrives first and the pulse A arrives Δτ time later.
We take one more example. Two delta function pulses are emitted at t = 0 and
t = Δt from the point source located at ̄rt. Then we have
ft(t) = Aδ(t) + Bδ (t −Δt) ,
(22.20)
where A and B are constant.
The spectrum of ft(t) is
U(ω) = A + Be𝑖ωΔt.
(22.21)
Substituting this in (22.6) and (22.7), we get the time-reversed pulse at ̄rs.

(22.22)
Note that the pulse A is emitted first, but the time-reversed pulse B arrives first (see
Fig. 22.3). This represents the time-reversal process that the pulse emitted first at ̄rt
is received last at ̄rs (first in, last out).

SUPER RESOLUTION OF TIME-REVERSED PULSE IN MULTIPLE
SCATTERING MEDIUM
In Section 22.1, we discussed the time-reversed pulse in free space. It was shown in
(22.18) that the transverse spot size is λo(L∕a) as expected. L is the distance from the
array to the source point and a is the total size of the array.
A question is what happens to the resolution if the medium is not free space, but
is a multiple scattering medium.

TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING
Intuitively, we may expect that multiple scattering may make the resolution worse.
However, numerical and experimental work show that the resolution improves under
multiple scattering. In this section, we present a theoretical analysis of this improved
resolution, called “super resolution.”
Let us note from (22.10) that the time-reversed pulse at (̄rs, t) is given by
fTR(̄rs, t) =
∑
𝑖
1
2π ∫gT
s g∗U∗e−𝑖ωtdω,
(22.23)
where g is Green’s function from ̄rt to ̄r𝑖and gs is Green’s function from ̄r𝑖to ̄rs.
In a multiple scattering random medium, Green’s functions gs and g are random
functions and therefore the time-reversed pulse fTR is random.
Let us consider the average pulse fTR which is given by Ishimaru et al. (2007).
fTR(̄rs, t) =
∑
𝑖
1
2π ∫gT
s g∗U∗e−𝑖ωtdω.
(22.24)
The correlation function gT
s g∗is called the mutual coherence function and repre-
sents the correlation of fields originated from ̄r𝑖and observed at ̄rs and ̄rt.
The mutual coherence function has been obtained for random distribution of
particles and turbulence (Ishimaru, 1997).
Here we use the following approximate form of the mutual coherence function in
the transverse plane at z = L.
gT
s g∗≈Γoexp
(
−
ρ2
s
ρ2

)
,
(22.25)
where Γo is gT
s g∗for free space given in (22.17), ρo is the coherence length, and ρs
is the transverse distance between ̄rs and ̄rt at z = L.
The free space spot size Wo = λo(L∕a) is given in (22.18). Therefore approxi-
mately, the time-reversal average field fTR is given by
fTR ≈
1
(4πL)2 exp
[
−
(
1
W2
o
+ 1
ρ2
o
)
ρ2
s
]
.
(22.26)
From this, we conclude that the spot size W in random medium is given by
1
W2 =
1
W2
o
+ 1
ρ2
o
.
(22.27)

TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING OF SINGLE AND MULTIPLE TARGETS
731
Noting that Wo = λo(L∕a), we can obtain the equivalent aperture size ae resulting
from the spot size W.
Wo = (λoL)∕a,
W = (λoL)∕ae.
This results in the following equivalent effective aperture size ae.
a2
e = a2 + (λoL)2∕ρ2
o.
(22.28)
Note, therefore, that if the coherence length is much greater than the free space spot
size Wo, the equivalent aperture ae is not much different from a and the random
medium does not have much effect on the spot size W.
On the other hand, if ρo is much smaller than Wo, then the spot size W is smaller
than free space spot size Wo. This is a mathematical explanation of super resolution.
Another physical interpretation is that when ρo is smaller than Wo, the angular
spread Δθ = (λ∕ρo) becomes greater than (λ∕Wo) giving equivalent aperture size ae
greater than the actual array size a.

TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING OF SINGLE AND MULTIPLE
TARGETS AND DORT (DECOMPOSITION OF TIME-REVERSAL
OPERATOR)
As we discussed in Section 22.2, the TRM can refocus the incident wave to the
original source. This characteristic can be used to form the image of targets. One
such method is called the DORT.
Let us consider a TRM at z = 0 (Fig. 22.4).

732
TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING
One of the matrices in time-reversal imaging is the “multistatic data matrix”
K = [K𝑖j]. This is a symmetric N × N matrix and its element K𝑖j is the signal received
at the 𝑖th antenna located at ̄r𝑖when the signal wave is emitted from the jth antenna
and reflected by targets. Consider the wave v (N × 1 matrix) applied to the N elements.
The wave propagates and is reflected by targets and received by the N receivers.
The received signal is then given by N × 1 matrix Kv where K is the N × N
multistatic data matrix. This received signal is then time reversed at each terminal
giving the next transmitted signal (Kv)∗.
This process can continue and if this sequence converges, then except for a constant
σ, we should get the transmitted signal (Kv)∗equal to the original transmitted signal
v. The constant σ represents the power lost by scattering and diffraction.
(Kv)∗= σv.
(22.29)
Rewriting this, we have
Kv = σ∗v∗.
This can be converted to an eigenvalue equation by multiplying both sides by K∗.
K∗Kv = λv,
(22.30)
λ = |σ2| = eigenvalue.
The N × N matrix T = K∗K is called the time-reversal matrix and is a Hermitian
matrix.
T′ = T,
(22.31)
where T′ is the transpose conjugate of T and K is symmetric, K′ = K∗.
The eigenvalue equation can be written as
Tv = λv.
(22.32)
Note that the eigenvalue λ for the Hermitian matrix is real and nonnegative.
Since T is Hermitian, we have
v′Tv = v′K∗Kv = Kv2,
v′λv = λv2,
(22.33)
and therefore, we have
λ = Kv2
v2
= real and positive,
(22.34)
where v2 = vector norm = ∑
n |v|2.

Excitation signal v is eigenvector of the time-reversal matrix T = K∗K.
Received signal u is eigenvector of T∗. If the same array is used for excitation and receiver,
u = v∗.
This shows that the eigenvalue λ is the ratio of the received power to the input
power, and that the largest eigenvalue represents the largest target giving the largest
reflected power.
By writing the eigenvalues in the decreasing order,
λ1 > λ2 > λ3 > ⋯λM.
(22.35)
This shows that the order of the eigenvalues represents the decreasing reflecting
power of targets.
Figure 22.5 sketches the process using v as the excitation signal. Alternatively, we
can use u as the received signal and get an alternative eigenvalue equation.
T∗u = λu.
(22.36)
The representations (22.33) and (22.36) are closely related to the SVD to be
discussed in Section 22.5.
Once we obtain K (multistatic data matrix) and the eigenvectors v and eigenvalues
λ, we can obtain the imaging function.
First note that the transmitted signal is given by (Kv)∗= σv (22.29). In order to
obtain the image, we consider the imaging function ψTR.
ψTR = gT
s σv,
(22.37)
where gT
s = [Gs1(̄r1, ̄rs) ⋯GsN(̄rN, ̄rs)] and v is the N × 1 eigenvector obtained from
(22.32).
www.ebook3000.com

734
TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING
The N × 1 vector gs is called the “steering vector.”
It is equivalent to sending a wave from each receiver focused on the search point
̄rs. In imaging, we may not know the location and the strength of the targets. We only
know or measure the multistatic data matrix K = [K𝑖j] and the eigenvectors.
In order to obtain the image, we use the signal σv and focus the wave to the search
point ̄rs by using the steering vector gs. If the steering vector is Green’s function
for the imaging problem, then the wave will be focused on the target. In general,
however, we may not know Green’s function and therefore we use an approximate
gs such as Green’s function in homogeneous background. The steering function gs is
the same as the focusing matched filter function used in SAR.
As was discussed in Section 22.2, we can include the time dependence. We let
U(ω) be the temporal spectrum as given in (22.1). We can use this pulse as the input
signal to form K. Then, we obtain the space–time time-reversal imaging. Following
the space–time formulation given in (22.6) and (22.7), we get the space–time imaging
function
ψTR = 1
2π ∫|U(ω)|2σgT
s ve−𝑖ωtdω,
(22.38)
where the spectrum U(ω) is applied to the input as well as the matched filter function,
resulting in |U(ω)|2. The time t = 0 corresponds to the time when the pulse for the
steering vector gs is observed at the target as shown in Section 22.1.
DORT is the French acronym for “d´ecomposition de l’op´erateur de retournement
temporel” (decomposition of time-reversal operator), and was proposed by Prada and
Fink (1994, 1995, 2001). It provides theoretical study of the iterative time-reversal
process and shows that in a multitarget media, the brightest target is associated
with the eigenvector of greatest eigenvalue. The discussion leading to (22.29) in this
section can also be explained by DORT.
In Fig. 22.6, we show the iterative time-reversal process. Let us start with the
first signal Eo (N × 1 matrix) applied to the transmitting array. Eo is reflected by the
targets and the reflected signal is then given by KEo.
This received signal is time reversed at each terminal and becomes E1 = K∗E∗
o.
This is emitted and received and given by KE1. The process can continue and after
n iterations, we get
E2n = (K∗K)nEo = TnEo,
K2n+1 = (K∗K)nK∗E∗
o = Tn(K∗Eo).
If we express the first signal Eo as a sum of eigenvector vp, we have
Eo = v1 + v2 + ⋯+ vp.
Then after 2n iterations, we have
E2n = TnEo
= λn
1v1 + λn
2v2 + ⋯+ λn
pvp.

For a large number of n,
λ1 > λ2 > λ3 ⋯> λp.
The first term becomes dominant, and we get
E2n ≈λn
1v1.
Therefore we conclude that after many iterations, the signal at each element of the
array converges to the eigenvector v1 of the largest eigenvector λ1 shown in (22.30).
22.4
TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING OF TARGETS IN FREE SPACE
It may be instructive to examine the imaging of point targets in free space. Let us
start with a single target in free space. The point target is located at ̄rt. The multistatic
data matrix K is easily obtained.
K = ggT = [K𝑖j],
K𝑖j = G(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω)G(̄rj, ̄rt, ω),
(22.39)
where g is N × 1 matrix of Green’s function.
g = [G(̄r1, ̄rt, ω)
G(̄r2, ̄rt, ω)
⋯
G(̄rN, ̄rt, ω)]T.
www.ebook3000.com

736
TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING
The time-reversal matrix T is then given by
T = K∗K = g∗g′ggT,
(22.40)
where g′ is the complex transpose of g.
Noting that g′g is a constant, we write
T = g2g∗gT,
(22.41)
where
g2 = vector norm = g′g =
∑
𝑖
|G(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω)|2.
The eigenvector v and the eigenvalue λ can be formed from (22.41).
Tv = λv,
(22.42)
where v = g∗and λ = g4. To obtain this, note g∗gTg∗= g2g∗.
For a single target in free space, this is the only nonzero eigenvalue and all other
eigenvalues are zero. However, this is true only for free space. In general, if a medium
is random, the eigenvalues are not always zero.
Using this eigenvector and eigenvalue, we can construct the imaging function
ψTR = 1
2π ∫|U(ω)|2√
λgT
s v exp(−𝑖ωt),
(22.43)
where v = g∗.
Note that the time-reversal imaging function (22.43) is identical to the refocused
pulse (22.10) from the TRM, except an additional spectrum U(ω) as discussed after
(22.38).
For steering vector gs, we use (Fig. 22.7)
gs = [Gs(̄r1, ̄rs, ω) ⋯Gs(̄rN, ̄rs, ω)]T.
(22.44)
Noting that
Gs(̄r𝑖, ̄rt, ω) = exp[𝑖k𝓁𝑖]

Gs(̄r𝑖, ̄rs, ω) = exp[𝑖k𝓁s𝑖]

As we note from (22.43) and (22.44), v = g∗and gs = g(̄r = ̄rt). Therefore, t = 0
corresponds to the time when the observed pulse is centered at the target point. As
we compare the TR imaging in free space (22.46) with that of the time-reversal
pulse (22.13), they are substantially the same and therefore the resolution of the TR
imaging in free space is the same as the TR-pulse from the TR mirror. The transverse
spot size should be λo(L∕a) and the axial spot size is |2c∕Δω|.
Let us next consider multiple targets located at ̄rm, m = 1, 2, … , M. The multi-
static data matrix K is then given by
K =

(22.49)
This can be thought of as the correlation of the fields at ̄rm and ̄rm′ where the point
source is located at ̄r𝑖. This is called the “point-spread function.”
Rewriting (22.48) as a sum of the terms with m = m′ and others, we get

Note that the first term of (22.50) represents the sum of the time-reversal matrix
of each target at ̄rm and the second term represents the correlation between the target
at ̄rm and ̄rm′.
If the targets are well resolved and independent, H(m ≠m′) = 0 and therefore
we get only the first term of (22.50). The imaging function of the well-resolved
multitargets is then given by the sum of all contributions from M targets given in
(22.43).
The eigenvalues for m = m′ are given by λmm′ = ν2
mH2(m = m′). The imaging

TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING WITH MUSIC (MULTIPLE SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION)
739
22.5
TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING AND SVD (SINGULAR VALUE
DECOMPOSITION)
In Section 22.3, it was shown that the eigenvalue equation for the eigenvector v for
the excitation signal is given by
K′Kv = λv.
(22.53)
Similarly, the equation for the eigenvector u for the received signal is given by
K′Ku = λu.
(22.54)
These two formulations are in fact identical to the SVD of the multistatic data
matrix K.
According to SVD technique, any matrix (m × n) K can be expressed by the
following.
K = uDv′,
(22.55)
where u is an (m × k) matrix, D is a (k × k) diagonal matrix, and v is a (k × n) matrix.
u and v are called the “left” and “right” singular vectors of K and orthonormal
eigenvectors satisfying
U′U = Ik,
V′V = Ik.
(22.56)
Note that the u (m × k) matrix is the eigenvector representing the m elements
receiving array and the v (k × n) matrix represents the n elements transmitting array.
If we use the same array for transmitter and receiver, then m = n.
D is the diagonal matrix with the elements σ1, σ2, …, σk and σ2
𝑖= λ𝑖.
We also note the following:
Kvp = σpup,
K′up = σpvp,
(22.57)
and if m = n, up = v∗
p.
It is therefore noted that the eigenvector formulation in Section 22.3 can be
considered as part of the SVD formulation.
22.6
TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING WITH MUSIC (MULTIPLE SIGNAL
CLASSIFICATION)
In Section 22.4, we discussed time-reversal imaging of a single target and multiple
targets in free space. For a point target, there is only one eigenvalue of the time-
reversal matrix T = K∗K, and the eigenvector is given by Green’s function matrix
www.ebook3000.com

740
TIME-REVERSAL IMAGING
of (22.42), and the eigenvalue λ is given by ‖g4‖ (22.42). The eigenvalue for the
other eigenvectors are all zeros. If there are M point targets, there are M nonzero
eigenvalues and the other (N −M) eigenvalues are zero, where N is the number of
array elements (Devaney, 2005, 2015).
Those eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues are said to be in the signal space
and the others with zero eigenvalues are in the noise space. It is also shown that
the eigenvectors in the signal subspace and in the noise subspace are orthogonal and
therefore the inner products of the eigenvectors in the signal subspace and the noise
subspace are zero. Noting these, we can form the MUSIC pseudospectrum
ψTRMU =
1
∑N
p=M+2 ∫dω|U|2gT
s vp
,
(22.58)
where vp, p = M, … , N, is the eigenvector in the noise subspace and if gs is the
eigenvector in the signal subspace, then the denominator becomes zero at the target
points. However, we do not know the eigenvectors g in the signal subspace, and
therefore we use an approximate gs.
If we use a free space Green’s function for gs, the denominator is not zero, but it is
small. The pseudospectrum (22.58) then gives a high image peak at the target point.
22.7
OPTIMUM POWER TRANSFER BY TIME-REVERSAL TECHNIQUE
The time-reversal technique described in Sections 22.3–22.5 can also be used to
optimize power transfer between the transmitter and the receiver.
Consider a transmitter consisting of N antenna elements and a receiver consisting
of M antenna elements (Fig. 22.8).

Kmn is the transfer function between the mth element of the receiver and the

is unknown.

OPTIMUM POWER TRANSFER BY TIME-REVERSAL TECHNIQUE
741
The following steps can be taken to obtain optimum power transfer:
1. Measure the transfer matrix Kmn.
We measure the transfer function Kmn between the transmitter element n
and the receiver m. These M × N elements Kmn are therefore assumed known,
even though the environment is unknown.
2. Form the time-reversal transfer matrix.
Using M × N matrix K, we form N × N transfer matrix T.
T = ̄K∗K,
(22.59)
where ̄K∗denotes the conjugate of the transpose of K, called the adjoint matrix.
Note that each element of K is reciprocal (Kmn = Knm), but K is not symmetric
unless M = N.
3. Calculate the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues.
We calculate the eigenvectors V𝑖and the eigenvalue λ𝑖.
TV𝑖= λ𝑖V𝑖.
(22.60)
In general, there may be N eigenvalues. Since T is Hermitian ( ̃T∗= T), all λ𝑖
are real and positive.
λ∗
𝑖= λ𝑖.
(22.61)
The Hermitian matrix T is also called the Graves power matrix and is used to
optimize the received power.
4. Determine the highest transmission efficiency. The largest eigenvalue λ𝑖is equal
to the highest transmission efficiency. The receiver output Vr for the transmitter
input V𝑖is given by
Vr = KV𝑖.
(22.62)
The total received power Pr and the total transmitted power P𝑖are
Pr = ̃V∗
r Vr,
P𝑖= ̃V∗
𝑖V𝑖.
(22.63)
Therefore, the transmission efficiency η is given by

5. Use the eigenvector for the largest eigenvalue as the transmitter excitation V𝑖.
The transfer function Kmn is Green’s function observed at the receiver n
when a delta function source is located at the transmitter m. The medium need
not be free space and there can be obstacles.
Similarly, the power transfer between transmitting and receiving aperture
can be obtained.
The eigenvalue equation (22.60) can be rewritten for the continuous aperture
distribution V(s′) on the transmitter aperture S𝑖and Vr(s′) on the receiver
aperture Sr (Fig. 22.9).
∫S𝑖
T(s, s′)V(s′)ds′ = λV(s),
(22.65)
where T(s, s′) = ∫S𝑖K∗(s, s′)K(s′, s)ds′, Vr(s′′) = ∫Sr K(s′′, s′)V(s′)ds′.
Note that (22.65) is a homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of the second
kind and its solution gives the eigenfunction V𝑖(s) and the eigenvalue λ𝑖. The
power consideration (22.64) can also be expressed as
λ = ∫ds ∫ds′T(s, s′)V∗(s)V(s′)
∫dsV∗(s)V(s)
.
(22.66)
It may be interesting to note that this aperture integral formulation is similar
to the aperture integral formulation for an open resonator where the largest
eigenvalue corresponds to the least diffraction loss.

CHAPTER 23
SCATTERING BY TURBULENCE,
PARTICLES, DIFFUSE MEDIUM, AND
ROUGH SURFACES
In Chapter11, we have been concerned with scattering of waves by well-defined
objects, such as radar cross sections and Mie scattering by spherical objects. There
are, however, other important cases that require different treatments. Microwave and
optical scattering by turbulence and particulate matter are examples that involve
less well-defined conditions. Ultrasound scattering by tissues requires knowledge of
tissue characteristics that can only be defined in statistical terms. Ocean surfaces and
terrain are cases where the surface is constantly and randomly varying.
In all of the above examples, an important characteristic is that the medium can
vary randomly in space and time, and we can describe the characteristics only in
statistical terms. It is therefore important to understand statistical wave theory in
contrast with deterministic wave theory.
In this chapter, we discuss basic aspects of statistical wave theory and its applica-
tions.
Most of the theories in this chapter are covered in Ishimaru (1997), where more
details are presented. Note also that in this chapter, the time convention is exp(−𝑖ωt).

air is illuminated by the transmitter, then what is the radar equation? (See Fig. 23.1.)
In turbulence, the bistatic cross section σb𝑖for a discrete object (23.1) is replaced
by σδV where σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) is the scattering cross section per unit volume of the turbulence.
As noted in (10.5), σ is the differential cross section per unit volume and is related to
the bistatic cross section by
σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) = 1
4πσb𝑖(̂o, ̂𝑖).
(23.2)
It is conventional, however, to use σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) for scattering from turbulence. Note also
that the scattering amplitude ̄f(̂o, ̂𝑖) of the volume δV of turbulence is given by (10.32)
̄f(̂o, ̂𝑖) = k2
4π ∫
δV
[ ̄E −̂o(̂o ⋅̄E)] [ϵr(̄r′) −1] exp(−𝑖k̄r′ ⋅̂o)dV,
(23.3)
and therefore σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) is given by
σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) = |f(̂o, ̂𝑖)|2∕δV.
(23.4)
It is, however, necessary to note the following. The electric field ̄E in (23.3) is the total
field at a point ̄r′ in turbulence. We assume that the relative dielectric constant ϵr is
close to one, and therefore the average dielectric constant ϵr = 1, and the fluctuation
ϵ1 = ϵr −1 is small ||ϵ1|| ≪1.

SCATTERING BY ATMOSPHERIC AND IONOSPHERIC TURBULENCE
745
The electric field ̄E is assumed to be equal to the incident wave ̄E𝑖. We also
normalize it so that || ̄E𝑖|| = 1 and ̄E𝑖= exp(𝑖k̂𝑖⋅̄r′).
We then write
f(̂o, ̂𝑖) = ̂es sin χ
(

(23.5)
where, as noted in Section 10.5,
̂es sin χ = −̂o × ̂o × ̂e𝑖
̄ks = k(̂𝑖−̂o).
(23.6)
We also note that the dielectric constant ϵr(̄r′) is a random function of ̄r′ and therefore
σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) of (23.4) needs to be written as a statistical average.
σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) = ⟨f(̂o, ̂𝑖)f ∗(̂o, ̂𝑖)⟩
δV
.
(23.7)
Substituting (23.5) into (23.7), we finally obtain the scattering cross section per unit
volume of turbulence.
We get

where ̄ks = k(̂𝑖−̂o).
If we assume that the turbulence is statistically homogeneous and isotropic, then
the covariance ⟨ϵ1(̄r′

2)⟩is a function of the magnitude of the difference rd =
||rd|| = |||̄r′

We can then express the integral in (23.8) in the following:

cross section per unit volume of the turbulence. Equation (23.12) shows the spectrum
Φϵ as the Fourier transform of the correlation function Bϵ. This is called the “Wiener–

SCATTERING CROSS SECTION PER UNIT VOLUME OF
TURBULENCE
As noted in Section 23.1, the scattering by turbulence is expressed by the scattering
cross section per unit volume of turbulence, which is given by the correlation function

SCATTERING CROSS SECTION PER UNIT VOLUME OF TURBULENCE

or the spectrum of the fluctuation of dielectric constant or refractive index of the
medium. Here are three commonly used spectra.
(a) Booker–Gorden Formula
Historically, scattering by atmospheric turbulence was studied by Booker
and Gorden in 1950 using a simple exponential function for the refractive
index fluctuation.
Bn(rd) = ⟨n2
1
⟩exp(−rd∕𝓁),
(23.15)
where 𝓁is the correlation distance.
The spectrum is then given by

Using this we get the cross section σ.
σ(θ) = 2
π
k4𝓁3 sin2 χn2

[1 + 4k2𝓁2 sin2 (θ∕2)]2 .
(23.17)
This is the Booker–Gorden formula, which depends on two parameters of the
turbulence, the variance n2
1 and the correlation distance 𝓁of the refractive
index fluctuation.
For tropospheric turbulence, the variance is of the order of magnitude
n2
1 ≈10−12, and the correlation distance is approximately 50 m (20.130).
(b) Gaussian Spectrum
If we assume the correlation function is Gaussian, we get
Bn(rd) = ⟨n2

(23.18)
(c) Kolmogorov Spectrum
The Booker–Gorden formula and the Gaussian formula are convenient to
obtain a good estimate of the scattering by turbulence. However, they are not
based on a consideration of the physical properties of turbulence.

748
SCATTERING BY TURBULENCE, PARTICLES, DIFFUSE MEDIUM, AND ROUGH SURFACES
A more realistic spectrum based on the actual turbulence characteristics
has been proposed. According to Kolmogorov, the turbulent eddies may be
characterized by two sizes: outer scale Lo and inner scale 𝓁o. The energy is
introduced into the turbulence in the eddy size greater than Lo, and in the eddy
sizes between Lo and 𝓁o the kinetic energy dominates over dissipation due to
viscosity.
For an eddy size smaller than 𝓁o, the dissipation of energy due to vis-
cosity dominates over the kinetic energy. The Kolmogorov spectrum is then
approximately given by
Φn (K) = 0.033C2

(23.19)
where Km = 5.92∕𝓁o and Cn is of the order of 10−7(m−1∕3) for strong turbulence and
10−9(m−1∕3) for weak turbulence.
23.3
SCATTERING FOR A NARROW BEAM CASE
If the transmitting and receiving patterns are confined within narrow solid angles, the
gain function G(̂𝑖) can be approximated by the Gaussian function.
G(̂𝑖) = G(̂𝑖o)exp (−ln 2 [(2θ∕θ1)2 + (2ϕ∕ϕ1)2]) ,
(23.20)
where θ1 and ϕ1 are the half-power beamwidths in two orthogonal directions, such
that at θ = (θ1∕2), the gain function becomes (1∕2). For bistatic case (Fig. 23.3), we

The attenuation τ in this section comes from the medium attenuation τa, and the
attenuation τs is due to the scattering. The attenuation τs is obtained by integrating
σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) over the solid angle 4π. We have

SCATTERING CROSS SECTION PER UNIT VOLUME OF RAIN
AND FOG
In Section 23.1, we discussed the scattering cross section per unit volume of turbu-
lence. It is described in (23.11) and (23.12) in terms of the correlation function of the
fluctuations of the refractive index, or the dielectric constant.
For rain, the scattering cross section per unit volume is given by

(23.26)
where n (p, a) is the size distribution, and n (p, a) da is the number of droplets per unit
volume having radius between a and a + da at the precipitation rate p (in millimeter
per hour), and σs (a) is the scattering cross section of a single droplet with radius a.
The precipitation rate p in millimeter per hour is given by

where v (a) in m/s is the terminal velocity of a rain drop with radius a (m), nda is in
m−3.
There has been extensive work reported on the size distribution of rain drops. The
most well known is the Laws–Parson distribution. The Marshall–Palmer distribution
is given by
n(p, a) = noexp(−αa),
(23.28)

GAUSSIAN AND HENYEY–GREENSTEIN SCATTERING FORMULAS
751
where no = 8 × 106 m−4, α = 8200p−0.21 m−1, and p is in mm∕hr. See Ishimaru
(1997) for additional details. The terminal velocity v (a) in m∕s is approximately
given by
v = 200.8a1∕2 (a in m) .
(23.29)
In practice, exact size distribution and scattering characteristics are difficult to obtain,
and therefore we make use of approximate formulas. The scattering characteristics
of rain for different precipitation rates have been reported, and approximate formulas
have been obtained. In Section 23.5, we discuss some of the useful formulas.
23.5
GAUSSIAN AND HENYEY–GREENSTEIN SCATTERING

The scattering function of particles with size distributions can often be approximated
by a Gaussian function. The scattering cross section per unit volume of the medium
is then given by

4πp(θ)
= αt
4π(4αp)e−αps2,
s = 2 sin (θ∕2) ,
(23.30)
where αt = extinction coefficient (m−1), and p(θ) is called the phase function.
Note that the phase function p(θ) is normalized so that

p(θ)sds = 1.
(23.31)
The Gaussian scattering function is mathematically convenient. It is, however, not
directly based on the physical properties.
The Henyey–Greenstein phase function is proposed to represent the optical diffuse
scattering by small particles with size distribution. It has been shown to be useful
for expressing optical scattering by fog and optical diffusion in tissues. The Henyey–
Greenstein formula is given by
p(θ) =

SCATTERING CROSS SECTION PER UNIT VOLUME OF
TURBULENCE, PARTICLES, AND BIOLOGICAL MEDIA
In Section 23.1, we discussed σ(̂o, ̂𝑖), the scattering cross section per unit volume of
turbulence. In Section 23.4, we discussed σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) for distributed particles such as rain.
In Section 20.7, we discussed σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) for ultrasound scattering by tissues. These three
discussions deal with three different physical problems. However, it should be noted
that all three represent scattering cross section per unit volume of the medium. We
can summarize these three cases as follows.
For turbulence, we have (23.11)
σ = π
2k4Φϵ(ks).
We neglect the polarization effect by letting sin2 χ = 1.
For particles, we have (23.26)
σ = ∫ndaσs (a) = ∫nda | f|2 .
For a biological medium, we have (20.82)
σ = π
2k4Sm,
S = Sk + Sρ + 2Skρ.
Summarizing, the cross section per unit volume is

23.7
LINE-OF-SIGHT PROPAGATION, BORN AND RYTOV
APPROXIMATION
In the preceding sections, we considered the scattering of waves by turbulence and
particles. Let us now consider the nature of the wave propagating through and scat-
tered by turbulence. We consider the wave equation
[∇2 + k2(1 + ϵ1)] U = 0,
(23.34)
where ϵ1 is the fluctuating part of the dielectric constant ϵ, and k2 = k2
o⟨ϵ⟩. ko =
the free space wave number and ⟨ϵ⟩is the average of the dielectric constant.
ϵ = ⟨ϵ⟩(1 + ϵ1).
(23.35)
In terms of the refractive index n we have
ϵ = ⟨n⟩2(1 + n1)2 ≈⟨n⟩2(1 + 2n1).
(23.36)
The solution of (23.34) can be expressed in the following two series:
U = U0 + U1 + U2 + ⋯,
(23.37)
U = exp(ψ0 + ψ1 + ψ2 + ⋯).
(23.38)
The first series is the expansion of the field and is called the Neumann series, and
each term is called the nth Born approximation.
Note that we can write (23.34) as
(∇2 + k2)U = −k2ϵ1U.
(23.39)
We convert this to the following integral equation for U:
U(̄r) = U0(̄r) + ∫G(̄r, ̄r′)V(̄r′)U(̄r′)dV′,
(23.40)
where V(̄r′) = k2ϵ1(̄r′) is called the “potential function” and G is Green’s function
which satisfies
(∇2 + k2)G(̄r, ̄r′) = −δ(̄r −̄r′).
(23.41)
Equation (23.40) is called the Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation. From (23.40),
we can obtain the series expansion (23.37) assuming that the series converges,
Un(̄r) = U0(̄r) + ∫G(̄r, ̄r′)V(̄r′)Un−1(̄r′)dV′.
(23.42)
The first term is called the first Born approximation
U1(̄r) = U0(̄r) + ∫G(̄r, ̄r′)V(̄r′)U0(̄r′)dV′.
(23.43)
www.ebook3000.com

754
SCATTERING BY TURBULENCE, PARTICLES, DIFFUSE MEDIUM, AND ROUGH SURFACES
Note that in the absence of the fluctuation ϵ1 = 0 and in free space, we get
U0(̄r) = G(̄r, ̄r′) = exp(𝑖k|̄r −̄r′|)
4π|̄r −̄r′|
.
(23.44)
In our discussion of scattering problems in preceding sections, we used the first Born
approximation. We now consider the series expansion (23.38). First, let us note that
k2ϵ1 represents the fluctuation and therefore it is a small quantity.
Noting this we write
U = U0 + ϵU1 + ϵ2U2 + ⋯
(23.45)
= exp (ψ0 + ϵψ1 + ϵ2ψ2 + ⋯) ,
(23.46)
where ϵ is a small parameter and the expansion (23.45) and (23.46) is the expansion
in powers of ϵ.
We can write (23.46) in a series form
U = exp(ψ0)
[
1 + (ϵψ1 + ϵ2ψ2 + ⋯) + 1
2(ϵψ1 + ϵ2ψ2 + ⋯)2 + ⋯
]
.
(23.47)
Comparing that with (23.45) and equating the same order of the powers of ϵ up to ϵ2,
we get the following relations:
U0 = exp(ψ0),
U1
U0
= ψ1,
U2
U0
= ψ2 + 1
2ψ2
1.
(23.48)
From this, we can see that the second-order ψ2 is related to the first-order ψ2
1 and
(U2∕U0).
It will be shown in Section 23.8 that the conservation of power imposes conditions
that give expressions for the mutual coherence function (MCF) by making use of the
first-order Rytov solution alone.
23.8
MODIFIED RYTOV SOLUTION WITH POWER CONSERVATION,
AND MUTUAL COHERENCE FUNCTION
The first Rytov solution has been extensively used for weak fluctuation problems. For
strong fluctuations, the moment equation method and the extended Fresnel–Huygens
method have been used to derive MCF, and both methods give the same results for
the second moment of the field. The first Rytov solution does not conserve power, but
it is convenient for the log amplitude and phase fluctuations in the weak fluctuation
case. In this section, we derive MCF using the first and second Rytov solutions in

MODIFIED RYTOV SOLUTION WITH POWER CONSERVATION
755
such a way that the final expression makes use of the first-order Rytov solution alone,
but satisfies the conservation of power.
In general, the phase perturbation series as shown in (23.38) is consistent with the
series expression of the WKB method (Section 3.14), which conserves the power by
keeping the first- and second-order terms. This is also consistent with the geometric
optics formulation where the first term satisfies the eikonal equation and the second
term is needed to satisfy the conservation of power.
Let us consider the Rytov solution, keeping up to the second-order term,
U = U0exp [ϵψ1 + ϵ2ψ2
] ,
(23.49)
where ϵ represents a small parameter for the perturbation series.
Let us then consider MCF.
Γ = ⟨UaU∗
b
⟩= (Ua0U∗
b0
) ⟨exp [ϵ (ψa1 + ψ∗
b1
) + ϵ2 (ψa2 + ψ∗
b2
)]⟩.
(23.50)
Now we assume that the exponent in (23.50) is normally distributed. Then the average
of exp (ψ) is given by
⟨exp (ψ)⟩= exp
[
⟨ψ⟩+ 1
2⟨(ψ −⟨ψ⟩)2⟩
]
.
(23.51)
Noting that
⟨ψ⟩= ϵ ⟨(ψa1 + ψ∗
b1
)⟩+ ϵ2 ⟨(ψa2 + ψ∗
b2

(23.52)
⟨ψa1⟩=

)⟩
= 0,
⟨1
2 (ψ −⟨ψ⟩)2⟩
=
⟨1
2ϵ2 (ψa1 −ψ∗

.
We finally obtain
Γ = (Ua0U∗
b0
) exp
[
ϵ2 (
⟨ψa2⟩+ ⟨ψ∗
b2
⟩+ 1
2
⟨(ψa1 + ψ∗

= (Ua0U∗

⟨ψ2

2
⟨ψ∗2
b1

.
(23.53)
Now the conservation of power requires that
Γ (a = b) = |Ua|2exp [ϵ2 (2Re⟨ψa2⟩+ Re ⟨ψ2
a1
⟩+ ⟨ψa1ψ∗
b1
⟩)]
= |Ua|2.
(23.54)
Thus we get the condition for conservation of power
2Re⟨ψ2⟩+ Re⟨ψ2

2 ⟩= 0.
(23.55)
www.ebook3000.com

756

The sufficient condition for the conservation of power is that
2⟨ψ2⟩+ ⟨ψ2
1
⟩+ ⟨||ψ1||
2 ⟩= 0.
(23.56)
The imaging part of (23.56) does not affect the conservation of energy as shown in
(23.54).
If we substitute (23.56) into (23.53), we finally get MCF.
Γ = Γoexp

D = ⟨||ψa1||

This is the final expression for MCF using up to second-order perturbation (23.50)
and power conservation (23.56).
ψa1 and ψb1 are the first Rytov solutions given by (23.48).
ψa1 = U1(̄ra)
U0(̄ra),
ψb1 = U1(̄rb)
U0(̄rb).
(23.58)
The modified Rytov solution is simple and useful. However, it is an approximate
theory, and more complete theories have been presented including the extended
Huygens–Fresnel formulation, the moment equation, the path integral approach, and
the diagram method. These are given in Tatarskii, Ishimaru, and Zavorotny (1993).

MCF FOR LINE-OF-SIGHT WAVE PROPAGATION IN TURBULENCE

We note that for a line-of-sight propagation, the wave propagates in one direction
and therefore the wave equation can be approximated by the following parabolic
equation.
The wave equation for u
[∇2 + k2(1 + ϵ1)]u = 0
(23.59)
can be converted to the following by writing
u = Uexp (𝑖kx) ,
2𝑖k∂U
∂x + ∇2U + k2ϵ1U = 0.
(23.60)
Since U is a slowly varying function of x, we note
|k∂U∕∂x| ≫|∂2U∕∂x2|.
(23.61)
And then we can obtain the following parabolic equation for U:
2𝑖k∂U
∂x + ∇2
t U + k2ϵ1U = 0,
(23.62)
where ∇2
t is the Laplacian in the transverse direction (y, z).
We now obtain the first Rytov solution based on the parabolic equation

It is therefore necessary to obtain Γab in (23.64) using (23.63). This process has been

Here we give examples that are commonly used (Ishimaru, 1997, 2004).
(a) Kolmogorov Spectrum
The Kolmogorov spectrum is given in (23.19). In many cases of turbulence
encountered in optical propagation, the separation ρ is between the inner scale
and the outer scale, and therefore we use (23.19) with L0 →∞and l0 →0.
Φn (k) = 0.033C2
nk−11∕2.
(23.67)
We then get approximately

(23.68)

This distance ρ0 is called the “correlation distance.”
(b) Gaussian Spectrum
If the spectrum Φn can be approximated by a Gaussian function (23.18),
we get

(23.69)
The phase function p (s) is given by
p (s) = 4αpexp (−αps2) .

COHERENCE TIME AND SPECTRAL BROADENING
If the medium or transmitter or receiver is moving in time, the time correlation of
the received signal is related to the motion. For example, if the medium is moving
transverse to the line-of-sight propagation path, then the time correlation of the
received signal at one point is related to the spatial correlation. As the medium moves
with velocity v, the time correlation of the signal in time delay τ becomes equal to
the spatial correlation in space ρ = Vτ. Therefore the temporal frequency spectrum
W (ω) is a Fourier transform of MCF with ρ = Vτ.
We have
W (ω) = ∫Γ(ρ)e−𝑖ωτdτ,
(23.76)
with ̄ρ = ̄Vτ.
Note that

(23.77)
The frequency spread ωc, also called the spectral broadening, is given by (V∕ρ0).
Comparing (23.75) with (23.77), we note that the angular spread θc and the spectral
broadening ωc are closely related to the correlation distance ρ0.
θc =

ωc = V

The coherence time Tc is defined as the time lag for which the correlation reduces to a

ωc.

23.12
PULSE PROPAGATION, COHERENCE BANDWIDTH, AND
PULSE BROADENING
In a multiple scattering environment with turbulence, a broadband pulse experiences
pulse broadening. The pulse broadening can be studied using the two-frequency MCF.
In general, MCF Γt in time can be expressed as
Γt = ⟨U(̄r1, t1)U∗(̄r2, t2)⟩
=
1
(2π)2 ∫dω1 ∫dω2Γω(̄r1, ̄r2)e−𝑖ω1t1+𝑖ω2t2,
(23.80)
where
Γω = ⟨U(̄r1, ω1)U∗(̄r2, ω2)⟩
is the two-frequency MCF.
The two-frequency MCF, Γω, is the fundamental function to analyze pulse prop-
agation and time delay and is the correlation function of the waves at two different
frequencies ω1 and ω2.
Noting that the field U(̄r1, t1) is given by the Fourier transform
U(̄r1, t1) = 1
2π ∫U(̄r1, ω1)e−𝑖ω1t1dω1
(23.81)
we get the intensity I (t)
I (t) = |U (̄r, t)|2
=
1
(2π)2 ∫dω1dω2Γω(ω1, ω2)e−𝑖(ω1−ω2)t.
(23.82)
This shows that the pulse shape I (t) is given by the Fourier transform of the two-
frequency MCF with respect to ωd = ω1 −ω2.
Let us now consider the two-frequency MCF Γω(ω1, ω2) based on the modified
Rytov solution. Following Section 23.8, and noting (23.57) we have
Γω(ω1, ω2) = U0(ω1)U∗
0(ω2)exp
(

,
D = |ψ1(ω1)|2 + |ψ1(ω2)|2 −2ψ1(ω1)ψ∗

As a function of ωd = ω1 −ω2, the two-frequency MCF decreases as ωd increases.

WEAK AND STRONG FLUCTUATIONS AND SCINTILLATION
INDEX
As a wave propagates through a random medium, the fluctuation of the wave increases
with distance. Therefore, the fluctuation may be called “weak” or “strong.” To classify

the fluctuation in this way, let us first consider the average intensity I = |U|2. The
variance of the intensity fluctuation
σ2
I = ⟨(I −⟨I⟩)2⟩
⟨I⟩2
= ⟨I2⟩−⟨I⟩2
⟨I⟩2
(23.86)
is called the scintillation index. For a short distance, the fluctuation is weak and the
scintillation index is small, and for a large distance, the fluctuation is strong and the
scintillation index saturates to unity (Fig. 23.8).
The scintillation index involves the fourth-order moment ⟨I2⟩. In Section 23.8, we
have been considering the MCF, which is the second-order moment. The fourth-order
moment requires extensive studies of the wave propagation using several techniques
including the moment equations, the extended Huygens–Fresnel principle, and others
(Ishimaru, 1997). For this discussion, we use the method based on the assumption
that the wave is a “circular complex Gaussian random variable” (Appendix 23).
Under this assumption, the fourth-order moments can be expressed by the second-
order moments and the solution approaches the correct limits for both weak and strong
fluctuations. To show this, we first note that under the circular complex Gaussian
assumption,
⟨I2⟩= 2⟨I⟩2 −⟨U⟩2⟨U∗⟩2,
(23.87)
where U = ⟨U⟩+ v, and ⟨U⟩is the average field and v is the fluctuation.
Noting that
⟨I⟩= ⟨|U|2⟩
= ⟨U⟩⟨U∗⟩+ ⟨vv∗⟩
(23.88)
we get
σ2
I =
2⟨U⟩⟨U∗⟩⟨vv∗⟩+ ⟨vv∗⟩2
⟨U⟩2⟨U∗⟩2 + 2⟨U⟩⟨U∗⟩⟨vv∗⟩+ ⟨vv∗⟩2 .
(23.89)
For weak fluctuation at a short distance, we note
⟨U⟩⟨U∗⟩≫⟨vv∗⟩,

and therefore the scintillation index approaches
σ2
I →
2⟨vv∗⟩
⟨U⟩⟨U∗⟩.
(23.90)
For strong fluctuation, we get
⟨U⟩⟨U∗⟩≪⟨vv∗⟩.
And therefore the scintillation index approaches
σ2
I →1.
(23.91)
Note that the circular complex Gaussian assumption leads to the correct behaviors of
the scintillation index at weak and strong fluctuations, and gives approximate values
for the region between the weak and the strong fluctuations.
It may be instructive to examine the behaviors of the wave U = Aexp (𝑖ϕ) in
weak and strong fluctuation regions. As shown in Fig. 23.9, for a short distance,
the fluctuation is mainly in phase, as the phase is directly related to the distance.
The amplitude fluctuation is small because the average amplitude is substantially
unchanged since A2 is substantially unchanged at short distance. The probability
distribution of the amplitude fluctuation is close to the Nakagami–Rice distribution

ROUGH SURFACE SCATTERING, PERTURBATION SOLUTION,
TRANSITION OPERATOR
Many natural surfaces, such as oceans, terrain, and biological surfaces and interfaces
are rough to varying degrees, and this roughness affects the propagation and scattering
characteristics of a wave. Propagation along a rough surface is different from that
along a smooth surface. A wave incident on a rough surface is not only reflected in a
specular direction but scattered in all directions. Imaging through a rough interface
is different from the image through a smooth interface. It is therefore important to
understand the effects of the roughness on the wave characteristics. In this section,
and the following sections, we discuss the fundamental formulations of the different
techniques dealing with rough surface scattering.
There are two standard methods of dealing with the scattering from rough surfaces.
One is the “perturbation method” and the other is the “Kirchhoff approximation.”
The perturbation method is used for scattering from rough surfaces whose rms (root-
mean-square) height (kζ)21∕2 is much smaller than λ∕8 and the slopes |||
∂ζ
∂x
||| and
|||
∂ζ
∂y
||| are much smaller than one, where ζ (x, y) is the rough surface height deviation
from the average. In this chapter, we use h(x, y) for the rough surface height. In
the literature, ζ is also commonly used. The Kirchhoff approximation is for rough
surfaces that are slowly varying so that the radius of curvature is much greater than a
wavelength.
These two standard methods have been discussed in detail in Ishimaru (1997),
Bass et al. (1979), De Santo and Brown (1986), Ogilvy (1991), Tsang et al. (1985),
Voronovich (1994), and Fung (1994). They also include more advanced topics of
rough surface scattering. In this section and the next, we focus on the perturbation
method; the Kirchhoff method will be discussed in Section 23.16.
Let us first consider a scalar wave ψ𝑖(̄r) incident on a rough surface with a
Dirichlet boundary condition where height h (x, y) is a random function of the surface
coordinate (x, y) (Figs. 23.10 and 23.11).

Rayleigh hypothesis. The wave is assumed to be up going only above the
surface. For a sinusoidal surface, the Rayleigh hypothesis is valid if the maximum slope is less
than 0.448.
The incident wave ψ𝑖(̄r) can be expressed in Fourier transform ̄ψ (̄r)
ψ𝑖(̄r) =
1
(2π)2 ∬
̄ψ𝑖(̄k)e𝑖̄k⋅̄x−𝑖kzzd ̄k,
(23.94)
where ̄k = kx̂x + kŷy, and ̄x = x̂x + ŷy.
Note that if ψ𝑖is a plane wave in the direction of (θ𝑖, ϕ𝑖), then
ψ𝑖(̄r) = exp(𝑖̄k ⋅̄x −𝑖k𝑖zz),
(23.95)
where ̄k𝑖= k sin θ𝑖cos ϕ𝑖̂x + k sin θ𝑖sin ϕ𝑖̂y, k𝑖z = k cos θ𝑖, and
̄ψ𝑖(̄k) = (2π)2δ(̄k −̄k𝑖).
If ψ𝑖is originated by a point source at ̄ro, we have
ψ𝑖(̄r) =
1
4πRexp (𝑖kR) , R = |̄r −̄ro|,
̄ψ𝑖(̄k) =
𝑖
2kz
exp(−𝑖̄k ⋅̄xo + 𝑖kzzo) if zo > z.
(23.96)
The scattered field ψs (̄r) can be written as
ψs (̄r) =
1
(2π)2 ∫
̄ψs(̄k)e𝑖̄k⋅̄x+𝑖kzzdk.
(23.97)
This scattered field ψs (̄r) is assumed to be an up-going wave only. This is called the
“Rayleigh hypothesis.”
In fact, this up-going wave is true only when z is greater than the highest point of
the surface. Between the highest point and the lowest point of the surface, the wave
should include both up-going and down-going waves (Fig. 23.12).
It has been proved that for a sinusoidal surface the Rayleigh hypothesis is correct
if the maximum slope is less than 0.448. In most practical situations such as ocean
surfaces, the maximum slope is less than 0.448 and the Rayleigh hypothesis can be
used.

Scattering in the direction (θs, ϕs) from a rough surface h(x,y) illuminated

Let us express the spectrum ̄ψs(̄k) of the scattered wave in terms of the transition
operator T (also known as the scattering operator).
̄ψs(̄k) = ∫Ts(̄k, ̄k𝑖)ψ𝑖(̄k𝑖)d ̄k𝑖.
(23.98)
We then apply the boundary condition
ψ𝑖(̄r) + ψs (̄r) = 0 at z = h

(23.99)
Therefore at z = h, we have

∫e−𝑖̄k′⋅̄xd̄x,
and obtain
∫e−𝑖(̄k′−̄k𝑖)⋅̄x−𝑖kz𝑖hd ̄x + ∫d ̄kTs
(̄k, ̄k𝑖

∫e−𝑖(̄k′−̄k)⋅̄x+𝑖kzhd̄x = 0.
(23.101)
This is exact and our task now is to obtain the transition operator Ts(̄k, ̄k𝑖) for different
rms height [(kh)]1∕2 and the correlation distance 𝓁of the rough surface.

SCATTERING BY TURBULENCE, PARTICLES, DIFFUSE MEDIUM, AND ROUGH SURFACES
Equation (23.101) is an integral equation for Ts, and in general, an analytical
solution has not been obtained. However, it is possible to obtain a solution using the
perturbation method for small height h. Let us note that
exp(𝑖kzh) = 1 + 𝑖kzh + ⋯,
(23.102)
and we keep up to the first order in kzh.
We then get
∫e−𝑖(̄k′−̄k𝑖)⋅̄x(1 −𝑖kzh + ⋯)d ̄x
+ ∫d ̄kTs(̄k, ̄k𝑖) ∫d̄xe−𝑖(̄k′−̄k)⋅̄x(1 + 𝑖kzh + ⋯) = 0.
(23.103)
If we let ̄H be the Fourier transform of h (x, y)
̄H(̄k) = ∫he−𝑖̄k⋅̄xd̄x.
(23.104)
And substituting this in (23.103), we get
(2π)2δ(̄k′ −̄k𝑖) −𝑖kz𝑖̄H(̄k′ −̄k𝑖) + (2π)2Ts(̄k′, ̄k𝑖)
+ ∫d ̄kTs(̄k, ̄k𝑖)𝑖kz ̄H(̄k′ −̄k) = 0.
(23.105)
Now noting that ̃H(̄k) ∼ϵ (a small number), we can obtain the expression
Ts = Ts0 + ϵTs1 + ϵ2Ts2 + ⋯.
(23.106)
Substituting this in (23.105) we get the zero order
δ(̄k′ −̄k𝑖) + Ts0(̄k′, ̄k𝑖) = 0.
From this, we get
Ts0(̄k′, ̄k𝑖) = −δ(̄k′ −̄k𝑖).
(23.107)
Similarly, for the first order, we get
−𝑖kz𝑖̄H(̄k′ −k𝑖) + (2π)2Ts1(̄k′, k𝑖) −𝑖kz𝑖̄H(̄k′ −̄k𝑖) = 0,
from which we get
Ts1(̄k′, k𝑖) = 𝑖2kz𝑖̄H(̄k′ −̄k𝑖)
(2π)2
.
(23.108)
We now note that the rough surface height h(x, y) is a random function and therefore
its Fourier transform H is also random. We can now consider the first and second

moments of the scattered wave. Let us consider the coherent scattered wave. This is
given by
⟨ψs(̄r)⟩=

(2π)2 ∫⟨ψs
(̄k)⟩e𝑖̄k⋅̄x+𝑖kzzd ̄k.
(23.109)
Noting that ⟨H⟩= 0, we get
⟨ψs(̄k)⟩= (2π)2⟨Ts(̄k, ̄k𝑖)⟩, ⟨Ts⟩= Ts0,
= (2π)2Ts0(̄k, ̄k𝑖)
= −(2π)2δ(̄k′ −̄k𝑖).
(23.110)
The coherent scattered wave is then given by the inverse Fourier transform of (23.104)
⟨ψs(̄r)⟩= −e𝑖̄k𝑖⋅̄x+𝑖kz𝑖z,
(23.111)
which is a plane wave scattered in the direction of (θ𝑖, ϕ𝑖) as given in (23.95).
Next we consider the incoherent scattered wave, which is given by
ψf (̄r) = ψs(̄r) −⟨ψs(̄r)⟩

The boundary condition is the continuity of ψ and (1∕ρc)(∂∕∂n)ψ.
For electromagnetic waves, as shown in Sections 3.4 and 3.5,
k1 = k0n1 = k0(μr1ϵr1)1∕2,
k2 = k0n2 = k0(μr2ϵr2)1∕2.
The boundary conditions for two-dimensional (x, z) problems are the continuity of
ψ and (∂∕∂n) ψ for s-polarization and the continuity of ψ and (1∕ϵ) (∂∕∂n) ψ for
p-polarization.
In this section, we consider the continuity of ψ and (1∕ϵ) (∂∕∂n) ψ. We use the
procedure similar to the perturbation solution in Section 23.14. We write the zero-
order and the first-order transition operators
Ts = Ts0 + Ts1 + ⋯,
Tt = Tt0 + Tt1 + ⋯.
(23.121)
We then get the zero-order solution.
Following the perturbation method in the Section 23.14, we get the equation for
the zero-order transition operators Ts0 and Tt0 from the continuity of ψ.
δ(k′ −k𝑖) + Ts0(k′, k𝑖) = Tt0(k′, k𝑖),

KIRCHHOFF APPROXIMATION OF ROUGH SURFACE
SCATTERING
As we stated at the beginning of Section 23.14, there are two conventional tech-
niques for scattering by rough surfaces: the Perturbation technique and the Kirchhoff
approximation. In this section, we outline the Kirchhoff approximation. This has
been studied extensively by Ishimaru (1997) and therefore, we only give essential
formulations in this section.
Consider a plane wave incident on a rough surface given by the surface height
h (x, y), which is measured from the average height, and therefore
⟨h (x, y)⟩= 0.
(23.131)
The scattered field ψs (̄r) is given by (6.17).
ψs(̄r) = ∫
s
[
ψ(̄r′)∂G0(̄r, ̄r′)
∂n′
−G0(̄r, ̄r′)∂ψ(̄r′)

]
ds′.
(23.132)
Under the Kirchhoff approximation given in Section 6.3, we have the surface field
ψ(̄r′) = (1 + Rf )ψ𝑖(̄r′),
∂ψ(̄r′)
∂n′
= (𝑖̄ks ⋅̂N)(−Rf )ψ𝑖(̄r′),
(23.133)
where Rf is the local reflection coefficient at ̄r′ and ̂N is the unit vector normal to the
surface, and
̄ks = (k sin θs cos ϕs)̂x + (k sin θs sin ϕs)̂y + (k cos θs)̂z,
̄k𝑖= (k sin θ𝑖cos ϕ𝑖)̂x + (k sin θ𝑖sin ϕ𝑖)̂y −(k cos θ𝑖)̂z.
(23.134)
Note that k𝑖z = −k cos θ𝑖, indicating that the incident wave is incoming.

(23.136)
where
̄V = ̄k𝑖−̄ks,
̄W = ̄k𝑖+ ̄ks,
̄V ⋅̄V′ = vxx′ + vyy′ + vzz′,
We also note that if the observation point ̄r(Rs, θs, ϕs) is in the far zone of the surface,
we can approximate Green’s function.

The first term represents the edge effect and is negligible compared with the second
term for a large area. Therefore ∂h∕∂x can be replaced by (−vx∕vz) in (23.136).
Similarly we can replace ∂h∕∂y by (−vy∕vz).
With this approximation we get
ψs(̄r) = 𝑖exp (𝑖kR)

where F is given by

cos θ𝑖+ cos θs
.
Note that ̄V ⋅̄W = k2
𝑖−k2
s = 0.
The surface height h appears in the exponent vzh in (23.137). If the surface is flat,
h = 0 and in the specular direction vx = vy = 0, θ𝑖= θs, and ϕ𝑖= ϕs we get
ψs(̄r) = 𝑖exp(𝑖kR)
4πR
(2k cos θ𝑖)Rf ∫
s

(23.138)
Normalizing ψs in (23.138) using the specularly reflected field ψo, we get

s
exp(𝑖̄V ⋅̄r′)dx′dy′,

where
f =

.
This is the general expression of the scattered field in the Kirchhoff approximation.
The rough surface height h (x, y) is in the exponent of the integrant.
Using (23.137), we can get the coherent field in the specular direction
⟨ψs(̄r)⟩= ψo (̄r) [ f] ⟨e𝑖vzh⟩,
(23.140)
where
χ(vz) = ⟨e𝑖vzh⟩= characteristic function of therandom height h.
If the height h is normally distributed with the variance σ2
o, then the probability
density function Wo (h) is given by
Wo (h) =

(2π)1∕2σ0
exp
(

(23.142)
The coherent field is then given by

0k2 cos2 θ𝑖
) ,
(23.143)
where [ f] = 1 in the specular direction θ𝑖= θ.
Ra = kσa cos θ𝑖is called the Rayleigh parameter. Rayleigh used this as a criterion
that a surface may be considered rough or smooth depending on whether 2Ra is
greater or smaller than π∕2.
Let us next consider the incoherent scattered wave. We start with (23.139).
ψs(̄r) = ψo(̄r) [ f] 1

The incoherent field ψd (̄r) is given by

Therefore the scattering cross section per unit area is given by

Under the assumption that the surface is statistically homogeneous and isotropic,
χ(v1, v2) is a function of (x2

If the surface is normally distributed, we have
χ(vz, −vz) = exp {−v2

ρ = [(x′ −x′′)2 + (y′ −y′′)2]1∕2.
(23.148)
Let us examine the scattering cross section (23.145) for the following two cases.
First, if the rms height σ0 is small, we can expand the following:
χ2(vz, −vz) −|χ(vz)|2 = exp [−v2

The series in (23.150) is divergent if v2

FREQUENCY AND ANGULAR CORRELATION OF SCATTERED
WAVES FROM ROUGH SURFACES AND MEMORY EFFECTS
In Section 23.14, we gave a conventional perturbation solution of the scattered wave
from rough surfaces. This is expressed as the scattering cross section per unit area
of the surface given in (23.114) for Dirichlet surfaces and in (23.119) for Neumann
surfaces. These represent the scattered power is the direction of ̄K when the wave is
incident from the direction of ̄K𝑖where, as shown in (23.94) and (23.95),
̄k = k sin θ cos ϕ̂x + k sin θ sin ϕ̂y,
̄k𝑖= k sin θ𝑖cos ϕ𝑖̂x + k sin θ𝑖sin ϕ𝑖̂y.
(23.153)
Now we seek a more general case where the two incident waves come in the directions
̄k𝑖and ̄k′
𝑖and the scattered wave is observed in the directions ̄k and ̄k′ (Fig. 23.13).
We wish to study the correlation of the scattered waves ψs(̄k) and ψ∗
s (̄k′). For a
Dirichlet rough surface, the correlation can be expressed as the scattering correlation
cross section of the illuminated area W2
0 of the rough surface. It will be shown that

SCATTERING BY TURBULENCE, PARTICLES, DIFFUSE MEDIUM, AND ROUGH SURFACES
the resulting correlation cross section depends on the illumination area, rather than
the cross section per unit area as shown in the previous section.
Following (23.114), we can obtain the following scattering correlation cross sec-
tion of the illuminated area W2
0 of the rough surface. For Dirichlet surfaces, we get

(23.154)
where ψf1 is the incoherent scattered wave in the direction of ̄k when the incident
wave ψ𝑖is coming from the direction of ̄k𝑖, and ψ∗
f1 is the incoherent scattered wave
in the direction of ̄k′ with the incident wave ψ∗
𝑖coming from the direction of ̄k𝑖.
Following (23.114), we can write this as

where
̄v = ̄k −̄k𝑖, ̄v′ = ̄k′ −̄k′

We can now use the center of gravity ̄xc and the difference ̄xd, ̄vc, and ̄vd.
̄xc = 1

̄vc = 1

Equation (23.155) with (23.158) and (23.159) give the correlation of the scattered

consider a special case of ϕ𝑖= ϕ = 0 in (23.120) .
Then, we have
̄k = k sin θ̂x,
̄k𝑖= k sin θ𝑖̂x.
(23.160)

This is called the “Memory effect,” and shows that even under multiple scattering,
the scattering wave “remembers” the direction of the incident wave as shown in these
figures. These figures show the part of the memory effect under the perturbation
theory of the rough surface scattering. The memory effect is more general than what
is shown here. It was originally proposed by Feng (1985), and extensive research has
been conducted.

CHAPTER 24
COHERENCE IN MULTIPLE
SCATTERING AND DIAGRAM METHOD
As a wave propagates through random media such as turbulence, rain, fog, or biolog-
ical media, the wave experiences multiple scattering, resulting in random variations
in amplitude and phase. It is then normally expected that the scattered wave is mostly
incoherent, and the wave scattered in the back direction is, in general, incoherent
and scattered in all directions, more or less uniformly. This conventional view is
consistent with and confirmed by the transport theory (radiative transfer theory).
It was therefore surprising that in an optical experiment with a beam incident on
many micro latex spheres suspended in water, a sharp peak in the scattering was
observed in the back direction. This optical experiment by Kuga and Ishimaru (1984)
and its theoretical explanation by Tsang and Ishimaru (1984) are among several
early works reporting on experimental and theoretical explanations of “coherent
backscattering” or “enhanced backscattering.” It is an optical equivalent of weak
Anderson localization, which was discussed by Anderson (1958) to explain the
absence of electron diffusion in multiple scattering in a disordered medium.
Enhanced backscattering occurs in many areas of engineering including scattering
from particles, rough surfaces, and turbulence. It is related to “retro reflectance” or
“opposition” effects, and observed enhanced backscattering by soils and vegetation.
In this chapter, we present an introduction to “backscattering enhancement.” Some
historical and additional accounts are given by Ishimaru (1991).

24.1
ENHANCED RADAR CROSS SECTION IN TURBULENCE
It may seem surprising that radar cross section (RCS) increases through turbulence, as
we may have the conventional view that RCS may decrease in turbulence. However,
this increase has been theoretically studied by noting that the backscattered intensity
in turbulence is proportional to the fourth-order moment and approximately twice
the multiple-scattered intensity. This has also been verified experimentally. In this
section, we outline the basic idea of enhanced backscattering in turbulence.
Consider an object in turbulence (Fig. 24.1).
The radar equation can be written as
Pr = Pt
λ2G2
(4π)3R4 σap.
(24.1)
The apparent target RCS σap is different from the actual RCS σb and we can write
σap = σb
⟨|eued|2⟩,
(24.2)
where eu is the normalized random field on the up link and ed is the normalized random
field on the down link. Note that in the absence of turbulence, ⟨eu⟩= ⟨ed⟩= 1. Also,
noting the reciprocity, we have eu = ed = e, and
σap = σb⟨|e|4⟩.
(24.3)
If the field through turbulence is Rayleigh distributed as is often the case, we have
⟨|e|4⟩= ⟨I2⟩,
(24.4)
where I = |e|2 is the normalized intensity.

Because of the correlation between the uplink and downlink fields, the RCS
is enhanced by a factor ranging from 1 to 2 (Rayleigh) to 3. The scintillation index ranges from
0 to 5 (Rayleigh) to 10.7.

We note that for the Rayleigh distribution, we have
⟨IN⟩= (N!)⟨I⟩N.
(24.5)
Therefore we get
⟨|e|4⟩= 2⟨|e|2⟩.
(24.6)
The apparent RCS is then given by
σap = 2σb.
(24.7)
This shows that the RCS is twice the actual cross section. The scintillation index S2
4
is given by
S2
4 =
⟨(I2 −⟨I2⟩)2⟩
⟨I2⟩2
= ⟨I4⟩−⟨I2⟩2
⟨I2⟩2
.
(24.8)
Now for the Rayleigh distribution, noting (24.5), we get
S2
4 = 4! −22
22
= 5.
(24.9)
Summarizing, the apparent cross section is twice the actual cross section and the
scintillation index is 5 assuming the Rayleigh distribution. Experimental evidence
for the enhanced RCS and the scintillation index has been given by Knepp and Houpis
(1991).
The Rayleigh distribution is typical in waves in turbulence. However, more gener-
ally the distribution can be better represented by the Nakagami-m distribution (1960)
where m ranges from 0.5 to 1 (Rayleigh)→∞. Then the apparent cross section
ranges from 3 to 2 (Rayleigh) to 1, and the scintillation index ranges from (32/3) to 5
(Rayleigh) to 0. A more complete study is given by Fremouw and Ishimaru (1992).
Concerning the enhanced backscattering due to turbulence, a question may be
asked about the relationship with power conservation. The conservation of power
requires that the enhanced backscattered power needs to be balanced by the decrease
of power. In our example, the decrease of power appears in the direction off the mono-
static direction, and this decrease of power should be observed off the backscattering
angle, where the correlation between the uplink and downlink waves can be negative.
24.2
ENHANCED BACKSCATTERING FROM ROUGH SURFACES
It is expected that the enhanced backscattering can occur, not only in turbulence,
but for rough surfaces as well. For rough-surface scattering, there are two distinct
enhancement phenomena, shown by E and SE in Fig. 24.2. E applies when the rms

Ranges of validity for Kirchhoff (KA), phase perturbation (PP), and field

enhancement due to surface-wave modes occurs in the range labeled SE. σ is the rms height,
and t is the correlation distance, of the rough surface.
height is close to a wavelength, and the slope is also close to unity. In that case, the
two waves scattered off the sloped surface interfere constructively in the back direc-
tion, producing the enhanced peak. The angular width is broad, and approximately
proportional to the slope (Fig. 24.3). An approximate theory has been proposed to
explain this phenomenon by making use of the first- and second-order Kirchhoff
approximations, with shadowing corrections (Ishimaru and Chen, 1991).
The second enhancement case, SE, occurs when the rms height is much smaller
than a wavelength, but the second medium supports a surface wave. This occurs when
an optical beam is scattered from a slightly rough metallic surface. If the incident
wave is polarized (parallel to the plane of incidence), and if the dielectric constant
of the second medium has a negative real part, then a surface wave is excited on
the surface, and two surface waves traversing on the surface in opposite directions
interfere constructively in the back direction, producing the enhancement. The angular
width is very small and is proportional to (a wavelength)/(the decay distance of the
surface wave) (Celli et al., 1985). The enhanced backscattering from rough surfaces is
important in several applications, including the study of surface plasmon localization
in rough-metal surfaces, phonon localization, and ocean acoustic applications.

ENHANCED BACKSCATTERING FROM PARTICLES AND
PHOTON LOCALIZATION
In 1984, an optical experiment was reported by Kuga and Ishimaru (1984) that showed
that the scattering from latex microspheres is enhanced in the backward direction,
with a sharp angular width of a fraction of a degree. It was explained theoretically,
by Tsang and Ishimaru (1984), that the enhanced peak is caused by the constructive
interference of two waves traversing through the same particles in opposite direc-
tions. Physicists have known that the transport of electrons in a strongly disordered
material is governed by multiple scattering, and that multiple scattering leads to
“Anderson localization” (1958, 1985) caused by “coherent backscattering” (John,
1990). It can then be shown that both electron localization in disordered material,
and photon localization in disordered dielectrics, are governed by coherent backscat-
tering, which is caused by the constructive interference of two waves traversing
in opposite directions. The experimental work, in 1984, was followed by several
independent optical experiments, showing that the backscattering enhancement is
a weak-localization phenomenon. The enhanced peak value is close to 2, and the
angular width is governed by the diffusion length in the medium.
Let us consider a plane wave, normally incident on a slab of randomly dis-
tributed particles. The first-order backscattering specific intensity, I1, is approximately
given by

The first-order scattering I1, the ladder term Iml, and the cyclical scattering
Imc. t is the mean free path for a thin slab, and the transport mean free path for a thick slab.
The multiple scattering Im consists of two terms, Im𝓁and Imc. One term, Im𝓁,
corresponds to the wave multiply scattered through many particles, and is called the
“ladder term.” The other term, Imc, corresponds to two waves traversing through the
same particles in opposite directions. This is called the “cyclical” or the “maximally
crossed” term, and has the same magnitude as Im𝓁in the back direction, but diminishes
away from the back direction (Fig. 24.4). The total intensity is therefore approximately
as shown in Fig. 24.4. The enhancement factor is given by
I1 + Im𝓁+ Imc
I1 + Im𝓁
= I1 + 2Im𝓁
I1 + Im𝓁
.
(24.11)
The enhancement factor is therefore between 1 and 2.
The angular width, Δθ, is (a wavelength)/(a mean free path), if the optical thickness
of the slab is of the order of unity or less. If the optical thickness is much greater
than unity and the particles are mostly scattering, then the wave is diffused, and the
angular width, Δθ, is (a wavelength)/(a transport mean free path). Note that the mean
free path, 𝓁, is normally much greater than a wavelength, and the transport mean free
path, 𝓁tr, is normally many times the mean free path. Thus, this is a weak localization,
in contrast with a strong localization, where the transport mean free path is of the
order of a wavelength and where particle sizes are in the resonant region. It has also
been observed, by Lagendijk and others, that the wave speed can be reduced to 10%
of the light velocity in strong localization.
The coherent phenomena discussed above cannot be obtained from the transport
theory (radiative transfer theory); these are new electromagnetic phenomena that have
been overlooked in the past. They should be important in lidar applications and in
geophysical remote sensing. It is also noted that the above optical experiment was
on weak localization. Intensive work on strong localization is under way, which may

24.4
MULTIPLE SCATTERING FORMULATIONS, THE DYSON AND
BETHE–SALPETER EQUATIONS
In Sections 24.1–24.3, we presented simplified heuristic discussions of interesting
coherent phenomena in multiple scattering. Exact mathematical formulations and
solutions are very much involved and have been studied extensively. In this section,
we present an elementary introduction to the important ideas and formulations.
Let us consider Green’s function of a scalar wave equation for the medium with
random fluctuation of relative dielectric constant εr = 1 + ε1.
[∇2 + k2(1 + ε1)]G = −δ(r −ro),
(24.12)
where ε1 is the fluctuation with ε1 = 0.
Rewriting this as
(∇2 + k2)G = −k2ε1G −δ(r −ro),
(24.13)
we get the following integral equation for G.
G(r, ro) = Go(r, ro) + ∫Go(r, r1)V(r1)G(r1, ro)dV1,
(24.14)
where V(r1) = k2ε1(r1) is called the random potential.
Rewriting this using the operator Lo and its inverse −L−1
o
= Mo, we get formally
LoG = −VG −δ, Lo = ∇2 + k2
G = −L−1
o VG −L−1

We can now assume that V(r) is a Gaussian random function, and derive the Dyson

where M is called the “mass operator.”

The Dyson equation (24.19) for the average Green’s function with the mass opera-
tor (24.21), and the Bethe–Salpeter equation (24.23) for the covariance with the inten-
sity operator, are two fundamental equations for the first and the second moments of
Green’s function in random media.
24.5
FIRST-ORDER SMOOTHING APPROXIMATION
It is clear that solutions for the exact formulation for the Dyson and the Bethe–Salpeter
equations in Section 24.4 are difficult to find, and useful approximations are needed.
The simplest approximation is called the “bilocal approximation,” or the “Bourret
approximation” or the “first-order smoothing approximation.” Mass operator (24.21)
is approximated by the first-order term. We have
=
+
(24.24)
For the scalar wave equation we are considering, the Dyson equation (24.20) becomes
⟨G(r, r′)⟩= Go(r, r′) + ∫Go(r, ro)Go(r1, r2)⟨V(r1)V(r2)⟩⟨G(r2, r′)⟩dV1dV2.
(24.25)
This integral equation can be solved analytically by using a Fourier transform.
G(r, r′) = exp(𝑖K|r −r′|)

(24.26)
where K is the solution of the following equation.

where d̄r1 = dV at r1 and d̄ρ1 = dV at ̄ρ1.
24.6
FIRST- AND SECOND-ORDER SCATTERING AND
BACKSCATTERING ENHANCEMENT
The Dyson and the Bethe–Salpeter equations in Section 24.4 are exact integral
equations for the average and the second-order moments. Though these equations are
compact and reveal the physical scattering process clearly, actual analytical solutions
are difficult to obtain. The first-order smoothing approximation in Section 24.5 can be
solved analytically for a homogeneous random medium. Where it becomes difficult
to solve for more general cases, it may be useful to use the first- and second-order
scattering theory.
The first-order solution is obtained by considering only the first-order scattering.
Therefore (24.24) becomes
=
+
(24.30)
Analytically, we write
⟨G(r, r′)⟩= Go(r, r′) + ∫Go(r, r1)Go(r1, r2)⟨V(r1)V(r2)⟩Go(r2, r′)dV1dV2.
(24.31)
Note that ⟨G⟩inside the integral in (24.20) is replaced by G0.
The second-order solutions are given by the following:

G(r)G*(ρ)   =
Go(r1, r′)Go*(ρ1, ρ′) .
(24.32)
Note also that ⟨GG∗⟩inside the integral in (24.29) is replaced by ⟨G0G∗
0⟩.

MEMORY EFFECTS
795
We can follow (24.28) and (24.29) to obtain analytical expressions for the second
moment.
It should be noted that the backscattering enhancement can be obtained by the
second-order scattering theory. Considering a medium with random distributions of
discrete scatterers, we can write
+
+
+
ψ(r)ψ*(ρ)   =
( ψ(r1)ψ*(ρ1) )
( ψ(r1)ψ*(ρ1) )
( ψ(r1)ψ*(ρ1) ).
(24.33)
The diagram represents the mean Green’s functions,
is the transition operator and
a solid line joining two
denotes that two
represent the same scatterer.
The first term of (24.33) is the intensity of the mean field, the second term is the
single scattering. The third term is the second-order ladder term, which corresponds
to the radiative transfer. The fourth term is called the “cyclical” term, which give a
sharp peak in the back direction, but diminishes off the back direction. This has been
discussed and shown in Fig. 24.5.
24.7
MEMORY EFFECTS
In Section 23.17, we made a brief remark about the “memory effects” using the
perturbation solution of rough-surface scattering. As was noted, the memory effects
are not limited to rough-surface scattering and apply to all multiple scattering from

random media. More general memory effects proposed by Feng can be stated as
follows:
A wave with the wave number vector ̄K𝑖is incident on a random medium at
frequency ω
(
k = ω
c
)
and the scattered wave in the direction of wave number vec-
tor
̄K is observed at ω. Another wave with wave number vector ̄K′
𝑖at frequency
ω′
(
k′ = ω′
c
)
is incident upon the same random medium, and the scattered wave
in the direction of the wave number ̄K′ is observed at ω′. Then there is a strong cor-
relation between these two scattered waves at ̄K and ̄K′ if the incident and scattered
wave number vectors satisfy
( ̄K −̄K𝑖)t = ( ̄K′ −̄K′
𝑖)t.
(24.34)
The subscript (vector)t indicates the component of the vector along the surface.
We have already discussed the memory effects in Section 23.17. These interesting
coherent interference effects with rough surfaces are also observed when the wave is
incident on a random medium, as noted in Fig. 23.13.

CHAPTER 25
SOLITONS AND OPTICAL FIBERS
25.1
HISTORY
Solitons are a “singular and beautiful phenomenon” of a nonlinear wave; so noted
John Scott Russell in 1844 in his “Report on Waves” to the British Association which
described his observations of hydrodynamic solitary waves and extensive wave tank
experiments in 1834 and 1835. He reported that when a boat in a narrow channel drawn
by a pair of horses suddenly stopped, the mass of water rolled forward “assuming the
form of a large solitary elevation, and a rounded, smooth and well-defined heap of
water continued its course along the channel apparently without change of form or
diminution of speed. (He) followed it on horseback and overtook it still rolling on at
a rate of some eight or nine miles per hour, preserving its original figure some thirty
feet long and a foot to a foot and a half in height… After a chase of one or two miles,
(he) lost it in the windings of the channel…” That was the first observation of the
solitary wave. In 1895, Korteweg and de Vries presented a study of solitary waves
for shallow water waves that includes both nonlinear and dispersive effects. In 1965,
Zabusky and Kruskal presented a study of the KdV equation for plasma waves and
coined the term, “soliton.”
The soliton is a solitary traveling wave solution of a wave equation that preserves
its shape and velocity. If more than one soliton collides, then after collision, each

soliton emerges without change of its shape except for a phase shift. Therefore we
can write the solitons before the collision.
ϕ(x, t) =
∑
𝑖
ϕst(x −u𝑖t).
(25.1)
After collision, the solitons become
ϕ(x, t) =
∑
𝑖
ϕst(x −u𝑖t + δ𝑖).
(25.2)
This is pictured in Fig. 25.1. It also shows that the larger the amplitude, the faster the
speed, and the narrower the pulse width.
It is important to note that if the wave speed varies with the wavelength, it is called
“dispersion.”. If the signal velocity varies with the magnitude of the signal, this is a
characteristic of a nonlinear wave. It is interesting to note that two solitons combine
to balance the dispersion and the nonlinear effects, and produce the solitary wave
given in (25.1) and (25.2) (Fig 25.2).
Today, solitons are observed in many fields of physical and geophysical environ-
ments. In 1973, Hasegawa and Tappert showed that an optical pulse in fiber forms an
envelope soliton. This will be discussed later.

Surface gravity waves on water are dispersive. The velocity V depends on the wave-
length and is given by (Lighthill 1978)
V2 =

)
tanh kd,
(25.3)
where
g = gravitational constant = 9.8 m∕s2,
T = surface tension = 0.074 N∕m,
ρ = density (water) = 1000 kg∕m3,
d = depth,
V = phase velocity = ω∕k,
and
group velocity = ∂ω∕∂k. The first term in (25.3) is due to the gravity wave and the
second term is due to the capillary wave. Therefore waves with wavelength exceeding
0.1 m are purely gravity waves. We then have
V2 = g
k tanh kd.
(25.4)
For deep water, tanh kd →1 and we get
V = V0 =

and we get

SOLITONS AND OPTICAL FIBERS
As seen in (25.3), the velocity V depends on the wavelength and this is a characteristic
of dispersion.
As we already discussed in Section 25.1, the soliton is a combination of the
dispersion and the nonlinearity. First we note that in the coordinate ξ = x −vt moving
with the wave, the wave height h does not change if there is no dispersion and
nonlinearity. Then we can write
∂h
∂τ = 0,
(25.7)
where τ = t and ξ = x −vt.
We can rewrite this in x −t coordinates

(25.8)
If we introduce small dispersion, we use V from (25.6). We note that since h is
proportional to exp (𝑖kx −𝑖ωt), (∂∕∂x) = 𝑖k. Therefore we write (25.6) as
V = V0 + σ ∂2
∂x2 .
(25.9)
Substituting this into (25.8), we get
∂h
∂t +
(
V0 + σ ∂2
∂x2
)
∂h
∂x = 0.
(25.10)
Next we include the nonlinear effect. V0 is no longer V0 =
√
(g∕k) and is slightly
depending on height h. Writing this as V0 →V0 + δ1h, we finally get
∂h
∂t + (V0 + δ1h)∂h
∂x + σ ∂3
∂x3 h = 0,
(25.11)
where δ1 = ∂V
∂h at h = 0.
This is the KdV equation (Korteweg–de Vries). We normalize that equation by
using time t′ = σt and h′ = h + V0

where the subscript t is (∂∕∂t), the subscript x is (∂∕∂x), and α is a constant.

The solution of (25.13) can be obtained by first noting that we look for a traveling
wave. We consider the wave, which can be expressed as
ϕ = ϕ(ξ) = ϕ(x −ut).
(25.14)
We then get
ϕx = ϕξ,
ϕt = −uϕξ,
where the subscript ξ denotes (∂∕∂ξ).
The original equation (25.12) is then written as
(αϕ −u) ϕξ + ϕξξξ = 0.

This is the soliton solution to Eq. (25.13).
This shows two important characteristics of solitons. First, the amplitude (3u∕α)
is proportional to the velocity u and therefore the larger the amplitude, the faster the
soliton travels. Second, the sech2 term shows that thepulsewidthis givenby (x −ut) =
2
√
u
, showing that the faster the wave, the narrower the pulse width becomes. Third,
the sign of the wave ϕ is the same as the sign of α, showing that if α > 0 (or α < 0),
the pulse is positive (or negative).
There has been extensive literature on solitons. Historical reviews and many other
works on solitons are given by Scott et al. (1973), Lonngren and Scott (1978), Dodd
et al. (1982), and Uslenghi (1980).
25.3
OPTICAL SOLITONS IN FIBERS
In 1973, Hasegawa and Tappert showed that an optical pulse in a dielectric fiber
forms an envelope soliton (Hasegawa, 1989; Yeh and Shimabukuro, 2008; Agrawal,
1989; Boyd, 2008).
Unlike the KdV soliton discussed in Section 25.2, the optical solitons are different
in that they are the soliton waves of an envelope of light waves that are modulated pulse
waves. Therefore this is sometimes called the “envelope soliton.” As we discussed in
Section 25.2, the soliton combines and balances the dispersion and the nonlinearity
effects to form and propagate a stationary pulse. This is one of the most significant
and useful characteristics of optical solitons in fibers.
Let us examine the nonlinear refractive index of fiber. Here we limit the discussion
to linearly polarized waves, and therefore the displacement vector ̄D, the electric field
̄E, and the polarization vector ̄P are all scalar and are given by
D = ε0E + P.
(25.16)
The polarization vector for nonlinear medium is given by
P = P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + ⋯
= ε0[χ(1)E + χ(2)E2 + χ(3)E3 + ⋯],
(25.17)
where E = E(t) is scalar and a function of time.
Here we only deal with linear polarization, so χ(1), χ(2), χ(3) are all scalar. In
general, however, if we include all polarization, χ(1) is the second-rank tensor, χ(2) is
the third-rank tensor, and χ(3) is the fourth-rank tensor.

P(1), P(2), P(3) in (25.17) are the first-order, second-order, and third-order nonlinear
polarization, respectively. χ(1) is responsible for the dominant linear susceptibility,
and χ(2) is for the second harmonic generation, but for optical fibers, χ(2) is generally
zero. Therefore, the lowest-order nonlinear effects on optical fibers are due to χ(3).
Next we examine P(3). For a monochromatic wave E = E0 cos ωt, we have
P(3) = ε0χ(3)E3
= ε0χ(3)E3
0cos3ωt = ε0χ(3)E3
0
(1
4 cos 3ωt + 3

.
(25.18)
The first term is the third harmonic and the second term gives the nonlinear effect.
Then the nonlinear term becomes
P(3)
(nonlinear)
= ε0

4χ(3)E2
0(E0 cos ωt).
(25.19)
This leads to the nonlinear term of the refractive index. The linear term n0 and the
nonlinear term nNL of the refractive index are then given by
ε = εL + εNL,
εL = 1 + χ(1) + 𝑖α,
εNL =

(25.20)
The nonlinear term n2|E|2 represents the Kerr effect, and n2 is called the “Kerr
coefficient.” n2 is of the order of 10−20(m2W−1) for silica optical fibers and therefore
it requires intensities such as those of lasers to produce the nonlinear effects.
Using (25.20), we write the refractive index n.
n = n0 + n2|E|2 + 𝑖α

n0 = 1 + χ(1),
n2 = 3

Using (25.21), we can now derive the nonlinear pulse propagation equation. This
has been obtained by using a perturbation technique (Agrawal, 1989; Yeh and
Shimabukuro, 2008; and Hasegawa, 1989).

804
SOLITONS AND OPTICAL FIBERS
Here we derive the equation using a parabolic equation, which is applicable to
waves propagating mostly in the direction ̂x.
Let us start with the wave equation
(∇2 + k2)u = 0,
(25.22)
where k is the wave number given by
k2 = k2
f n2, kf = free space wave number.
Note that k includes the dispersion and the nonlinear term.
Let us write
u = Uexp(𝑖k0x),
(25.23)
where k0 = kf n0 is the wave number for the medium excluding dispersion, nonlinear
effects, and attenuation.
Substituting this into (25.22) and noting
∇2u = [∇2U + 2∇U ⋅(𝑖k0̂x) + U (−k2
0
)] exp(𝑖k0x),
we get
[

+ 𝑖2k0

U = 0.
(25.24)
Now we note that
||||
∂2
∂x2 U||||
≪||||
k∂U

as long as the slowly varying function U varies only over a distance much greater
than the wavelength. We then get the following parabolic equation
𝑖2k0
∂U
∂x + ∇2
t U + (k2 −k2
0
) U = 0,
(25.25)
where ∇2
t = ∂2
∂y2 + ∂2
∂z2 is the transverse Laplacian.
Let us consider a one-dimensional propagation (∇2
t = 0).
We have
𝑖∂U

(k2 −k2

)
2k0
U = 0.
(25.26)

Since k is only slightly different from k0, we write
(k2 −k2
0
)
2k0
= (k + k0)(k −k0)
2k0
≈(k −k0).
Thus, we get the following equation for U, where the dispersion, the normalization
effects, and the attenuation are included in k.
𝑖∂U
∂x + (k −k0)U = 0.
(25.27)
Now we write

where

∂ω2 .
Converting this to time domain using the following:
∫

we get
Δω = 𝑖∂
∂t and (Δω)2 =

.
Equation (25.27) is now transformed to the following:

U = 0.
(25.29)
This is the final expression for the nonlinear pulse propagation equation. Note that U
is the electric field E which includes dispersion and nonlinear effects as indicated in
(25.23). If U is different from E, then the coefficient in the nonlinear term needs to
be changed as was shown in Agrawal (1989).

SOLITONS AND OPTICAL FIBERS
This section gives a short sketch of the solitons in optical fiber, considering only
a one-dimensional case where the transverse variation in the cross section of a fiber
is not considered. There is extensive literature with a more complete discussion on
nonlinear fiber optics (Agrawal, 1989) and (Yeh and Shimabukuro, 2008), If k′′ in
(25.29) is positive, the solitary wave appears as the absence of a light wave and is
called a “dark” soliton (Hasegawa, 1989).

CHAPTER 26
POROUS MEDIA, PERMITTIVITY, FLUID
PERMEABILITY OF SHALES AND
SEISMIC CODA
In this chapter, we discuss the characteristics of porous media and seismic coda
waves. A porous medium is a material containing pores or voids. The frame is the
skeletal portion of the material, often called the “matrix.” The pores are often filled
with liquid (oil and gas), such as those found in shale formations during hydraulic
fracturing (fracking) in petroleum engineering. In Section 8.6, we discussed a “mixing
formula” to express the effective dielectric constant of a mixture of two or more
materials with different dielectric constants. A porous medium is similar to this. In
fact, for the mixing formula, we use the fractional volume of the ith species as f𝑖
with
∑
𝑖
f𝑖= 1.
(26.1)
For a porous medium, we use the porosity ϕ, which is related to the fractional volume
of the matrix fm.
ϕ = 1 −fm.
(26.2)
The porosity ϕ is therefore the fractional volume of the pore (or void).
One of the important examples of a porous medium is oil shale. We will discuss
two subjects related to oil shale. One is the permittivity and conductivity of the
porous medium as given by Archie’s law. The other is the flow of liquid such as

oil through the porous medium as given by Darcy’s law and “fluid” permeability,
which is different from the “magnetic” permeability concept we commonly use in
electromagnetic studies.
26.1
POROUS MEDIUM AND SHALE, SUPERFRACKING
Even though our interest is not in petroleum engineering, for which extensive works
have been reported already, we give a brief introduction to superfracking, a well-
known technique for extracting oil or gas. Natural gas and oil production have
increased in the United States in recent years, primarily due to hydraulic fracturing
called “superfracking” in which large volumes of low-viscosity water are pumped
into a low permeability shale formation (Turcotte et al., 2014). Note that permeability
of the porous medium is not the “magnetic” permeability concept commonly used
in electromagnetic studies. It is instead the rate of diffusion of a fluid under pressure
through a porous medium (Revil and Cathles, 1999).
In Fig. 26.1, (a) traditional fracking and (b) superfracking are shown. In traditional
fracking, a high-viscosity fluid creates a single hydraulic fracture through which oil
or gas migrates to the production well. In superfracking, a horizontal production
well is created to access a wide distribution of hydraulic fractures. In the United
States, important shale producing locations include “Barnett shale” in Texas, “Bakken
shale” in North Dakota, Montana, and Saskatchewan, and “Monterey shale” in
California.
Shales are a rock equivalent of mud, just as sandstones are a rock equivalent of
sand. Shales can extend horizontally for a thousand kilometers with a porosity of
2–20%. The shales that are a main source of hydrocarbons are known as “black
shales” (Turcotte et al., 2014). Their pores are typically filled with 2–18% by weight
of carbon in organic compounds. A representative grain in shale is less than 4 μm
wide (Turcotte et al., 2014).
Fracking has several environmental concerns including reduction and contamina-
tion of available water, leakage of methane gas into the environment, and triggering
of earthquakes.

PERMITTIVITY AND CONDUCTIVITY OF POROUS MEDIA
809
26.2
PERMITTIVITY AND CONDUCTIVITY OF POROUS MEDIA,
ARCHIE’S LAW, AND PERCOLATION AND FRACTAL
The ground penetrating radar (GPR) technique is used for near surface geophysical
subsurface imaging. Critical parameters for GPR include the dielectric constant,
porosity, and water saturation, and frequencies are usually 25–1500 MHz. There
have been extensive studies in modeling and experimental data (Martinez-Byrnes,
2001). It is important to study mixing models of geophysical materials, and the
effective medium models such as Bruggeman are useful for studies of bulk dielectric
constant, water saturation, and porosity. Carcione and Serian (2000) discuss detection
of hydrocarbons in the subsoil. At radar frequencies (50 MHz to 1 GHz), hydrocarbons
have a relative permittivity ranging from 2 to 30 while the permittivity of water is 80.
The conductivity of hydrocarbons ranges from 0 to 10 mS/m while the conductivity
of saltwater is 200 mS/m or more. (The unit for conductivity is (A/Vm) or (S/m),
where S is siemens.) Therefore there is sufficient contrast between hydrocarbons and
water for detection and mapping of hydrocarbons.
Determination of the dielectric constant of the porous medium in terms of the
composition of the mixtures is of great importance for characterization, monitoring,
and evaluation. In Fig. 26.2 a simplified sketch of a porous medium is shown, where
the fractional volume of rock (matrix) is fm. The pore or void is partly filled with
hydrocarbon with a fractional volume of fh = (1 −Sw)ϕ, and partly filled with water
with a volume fraction of fw = Swϕ, where Sw is the fraction of pore space saturated
with water. This is a mixture of solid fm and two liquids fh and fw. Additional
complications include complex shapes, other minerals and materials. In this section,

fm = matrix = 1 −ϕ,
fh = (1 −Sw)ϕ = hydrocarbon,

fh + fw = ϕ,
fm + fh + fw = 1.

810
POROUS MEDIA, PERMITTIVITY, FLUID PERMEABILITY OF SHALES AND SEISMIC CODA
we give a simplified theory of the mixture based on the Bruggeman model (Polder–van
Santen) given in Section 8.6. We start with (8.31).

(26.3)
where εm is the dielectric constant of the matrix, εh is the dielectric constant of
hydrocarbon, and εw is the dielectric constant of water. εl is the effective dielectric
constant of the medium.
Note that
εm = ε′

σw = conductivity of water,
σl = conductivity of effective medium.
(26.4)
We can also convert (26.3) in the following alternative form. Noting for the ith
medium,
f𝑖
ε𝑖−εl
ε𝑖+ 2εl
= f𝑖
ε𝑖+ 2εl −3εl
ε𝑖+ 2εl

3εl f𝑖
ε𝑖+ 2εl
,
(26.5)
we get
∑
𝑖
f𝑖−
∑

3εl f𝑖

= 0.
Therefore we get the following alternative Bruggeman form:
fm
εm + 2εl

fh

+
fw
εw + 2εl
= 1
3εl
.
(26.6)
It is then possible to calculate εl for a given εm, εh, and εw (or Sw and ϕ). As a special
case, we consider a limiting case of dc when ω →0. Then the conductivity of the
effective dielectric constant εl is dominated by (𝑖σl∕ωε0) and the dialectic constant
of water εw is dominated by (𝑖σw∕ωε0). As a limiting case (ω →0), we get
σe ≈σw
(3

.
(26.7)
This is valid only if ϕSw > (1∕3).

FLUID PERMEABILITY AND DARCY’S LAW
811
The above simplified results do not include different processes of forming the
porous medium such as adding oil and rock grains separately or simultaneously
resulting in different results for (σ∕σw) (Feng and Sen, 1985; Sen et al., 1981).
A more realistic model of effective conductivity σe was discovered by Archie
(Gao, 2012). It is an empirical law relating porosity, electrical conductivity, and brine
saturation of rocks.
σ = 1
aσwϕmSn
w,
(26.8)
where σ and σw are the conductivities of the medium and the formation saline water,
m is the porosity/cementation exponent with common values of 1.8 < m < 2.0, n
is the saturation exponent, usually close to 2, and a is a tortuosity factor which
corrects for variations in compaction, pore structure, and grain size, ranging from 0.5
to 1.5. (Moldrup et al., 2001) The bulk dielectric permittivity is affected by factors
such as the air–solid–water interface (Chen and Or, 2006). A constitutive law for the
electric response of saturated and unsaturated porous media is presented (Brovelli
and Cassiani, 2010).
The study of porous media is closely related to the “percolation theory” (Stauffer
and Aharony, 1991) and the “fractal” (Mandelbrot, 1977; Falconer, 1990). As an
example, consider a random distribution of regions filled with hard rock, while the
rest are pores filled with oil or gas. If the porosity ϕ is small, only a small amount
of oil can be produced. If the porosity is well above the critical value, ϕc, it may
be possible to produce a large amount of oil. However, the situation may be more
complex if the porosity is close to ϕc. Oil fields and fractals are discussed by Stauffer
and Aharony (1991).
Determination of porosity by dielectric permittivity measurements are discussed
by Lina, Olivares et. al. (2000) including fractal geometry and porosity, instead of
estimating the porosity with the common “mixture law.”
26.3
FLUID PERMEABILITY AND DARCY’S LAW
The permeability of a porous medium such as shale is a measure of the resistance to
the flow of a fluid through the medium (Revil and Cathles, 1999). Low permeability
means it is difficult for fluid to pass through the medium. If fluid can pass through
the porous medium easily, it has high permeability. The total discharge rate q per unit
area obeys Darcy’s law
q = −κ
μ∇p,
(26.9)
where q is the Darcy flux (discharge per unit area per unit time m3∕m2s), κ is
permeability expressed in Darcy (m2), μ is viscosity (Pa ∙s), and p is pressure (Pa).
The fluid velocity v is then given by
v(m∕s) = q
ϕ,
ϕ = Porosity.
(26.10)

812
POROUS MEDIA, PERMITTIVITY, FLUID PERMEABILITY OF SHALES AND SEISMIC CODA
This accounts for the fact that only a fraction of the total volume is available for
flow. The permeability κ is usually expressed in millidarcy (10−3 darcy). For highly
fractured rocks the permeability is 108 ∼105 millidarcy, for rocks it is 104 ∼100,
and for sandstones it is 10 ∼1.
Shales have low permeability and therefore historically are a poor producer of
hydrocarbons until horizontal drilling and advances in hydraulic fracking led to
highly fractured rocks with high permeability.
For superfracking, large volumes of water with additives called “slick water” are
injected with high pressure, which may create microseismic events, usually much too
small to be felt at the surface. The flow of liquid in a porous medium whose structure
is fractal is discussed by Adler (1996).
26.4
SEISMIC CODA, P-WAVE, S-WAVE, AND RAYLEIGH
SURFACE WAVE
The upper 100 km of the earth consisting of the crust and the uppermost mantle is
called the “lithosphere,” which has been investigated using classical layered models.
However, the crust is heterogeneous with scales of a few kilometers to tens of kilo-
meters which creates the continuous wave trains in the tail portion of seismograms.
These wave trains are called the “coda.” The local earthquakes propagate through
the lithosphere over distances of 100 km with frequencies from 1 to 30 Hz. The
initial appearance of the seismic wave is followed by the wave train “coda,” which is
the incoherent wave scattered by the heterogeneous earth and is important to probe
information on the earthquake source and media. (Sato et al., 2012).
The earth’s crust can be considered a heterogeneous elastic solid, and seismic
waves consist of a P-wave (pressure wave, longitudinal wave), S-wave (shear wave,
transverse wave), and Rayleigh surface wave. The waves in an elastic solid (such as
the earth) can be expressed in terms of the scalar potential ϕ and the vector potential
Îψ and they satisfy the following wave equation

See Appendix 26.
The P-wave velocity is approximately 5 −6 km∕s and the S-wave velocity is
approximately 3 km∕s, and the Rayleigh wave velocity is close to 90% of the
S-wave. The Rayleigh wave is confined to the neighborhood of the earth–air bound-
ary. This means that both P- and S-waves are in general spherical waves when excited
by a point source. This is also called the “body wave.” The Rayleigh wave is a cylin-
drical surface wave, and thus the magnitude of the Rayleigh wave can become greater
than that of the P- and S-wave at large distances.
S-wave is the vector wave and therefore there are two polarized components. For
a plane boundary, there are two types of transverse waves: SV-waves and SH-waves.
The SV-waves have the displacement component in the plane of incidence, while the
SH-waves have the component perpendicular to the incidence plane.
26.5
EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE SCALES
The earthquake source is called the “hypocenter” and the point on the earth’s surface
directly above the hypocenter is called the “epicenter” (Fig. 26.3). The earthquake
magnitude is the most often cited measure of an earthquake size. There are several
different types of earthquake magnitudes. The Richter scale ML (local amplitudes)
was developed in 1935 by C. F. Richter, based on the amplitude A in μm of the largest
seismograin wave trace of the peak ground action at a period approximately 1 s. Thus
ML ∼log (A∕T
) + [correct𝑖on factor],
where A = 10 (μm), T ≈1 s. This gives ML ∼1.0. For amplitude of 100 μm =
0.1 mm, this gives ML ∼2.0. For amplitude of 1 mm, this gives ML ∼3.0. T is

the period of the measured signal in seconds, and is typically T ∼0.8 s, which was
chosen by Richter based on what we feel and what may damage buildings and other
structures, using the standard short-period torsion seismometer. This is based on the
peak ground motion due to the S-wave or surface wave. The Richter scale reflects the
amount of seismic energy up to about ML = 6.5, but it saturates beyond ML = 6.5.
The surface wave magnitude, Ms, is based on ground motion due to a Rayleigh
surface wave. There are many formulas that account for specific geographic regions.
Typically, the standard surface wave formula is
Ms = log10
(A∕T
) + [correction factor due to distance],
(26.13)
where A (in microns) is the amplitude of ground motion, and T is the period (in
seconds), typically 20 s.
The body-wave magnitude, mb, (short period) is based on ground motion due to
a P-wave over a period of 1 s, while Mb is for the body wave over a longer period.
The body wave propagates through the earth, while the Rayleigh surface waves are
confined near the surface.
Seismic moment MO and moment magnitude MW are related to the amount of
energy released and are different from other magnitudes based on the ground motion
at the observation point. The seismic moment MO is defined as
MO = DAμ,
where D is the average displacement over the entire fault surface, A is the area of the
fault surface and μ is the average shear rigidity of the faulted rocks (Kanamori, 1977;
Pasyanos, 2010). The moment magnitude, MW, is related to MO. (Kanamori, 1977)
MW = (2∕3
)MO −16.1,
(26.14)
In addition to the above, the intensity in the surface shaking can be used. At the
Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the accelerations measured by seismometers
are used, with 10 levels of “Shindo” (Shindo is the degree of shaking).
26.6
WAVEFORM ENVELOPE BROADENING AND CODA
Figure 26.4 shows typical seismic waves observed at the receiver. Note that in gen-
eral, a P-wave arrives first with the envelope, which includes the coda (wave train).
Earthquake magnitude scales are measured in a period shown in the figure. In general,
longer earthquakes require measuring over longer periods so that the measurements
do not miss important features. However, this also means that the choice of peri-
ods needs to be made appropriately. Most magnitude scales depend on the observed
waveform with the period, except the moment magnitudes, MO and MW, which are
based on the energy released at the source.

The total seismic energy radiated from the source propagates outward. The total
propagating energy will experience attenuation due to energy absorption by intrinsic
material characteristics expressed by the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. It
also experiences scattering due to heterogeneous earth and the total energy is split
into the “coherent” component and the partially coherent component. This partially
coherent component is commonly called the “incoherent” and is the key component of
the “wave train” called the “coda.” It is therefore important and necessary to study the
“coda” in order to understand the total energy radiation, rather than the data based on
the amplitude in a period, which can be arbitrary. The study of the P-coda, S-coda, and
Rayleigh-coda is therefore critical to the understanding of the total seismic radiation.

Let us first consider an idealized case of a point impulse radiator of a P-wave located
in heterogeneous earth, radiating spherical wave with total energy W. In this section,
we neglect the earth–air boundary. The earth is assumed to be homogenous and an
isotropic random medium.
We first note that the scattering due to the heterogeneous earth is confined within
small angles in the forward direction because the correlation length of the medium
is much greater than a wavelength in most cases. Thus, the scattering effects can be
approximated by plane wave scattering.
Let us study the pulse propagation in random heterogeneous earth. The intensity
at r and t of a P-wave in homogeneous earth due to an impulse source δ(t) is given
by
I0(r, t) =
W
4πr2 δ[t −(r∕c)],
(26.15)
where W is the total energy and c is the wave velocity in homogeneous earth.
In heterogeneous earth, the velocity c is changed to vp, that of the coherent
component of a P-wave, and the intensity is absorbed and scattered by the medium.
We express this as
I0(r, t) = W exp(−αar)
4πr2
[Icoh + I𝑖ncoh],
(26.16)

POROUS MEDIA, PERMITTIVITY, FLUID PERMEABILITY OF SHALES AND SEISMIC CODA
where αa is the intrinsic attenuation loss due to the imaginary part of the medium
dielectric constant. Icoh is the coherent component and I𝑖ncoh is the incoherent com-
ponent. The coherent component diminishes due to the absorption and the scattering.
The attenuation due to the absorption is included in exp(−αar). The attenuation of
the coherent component due to the scattering is represented by the total scattering in
all directions. Thus we get
Icoh = exp(−αsr)δ[t −(r∕v
)],
(26.17)
where αs is the “scattering cross section” per unit volume of the medium and is given
by (Ishimaru, 1997, p. 335)

where σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) is the differential cross section per unit volume of the medium given
by
σ(̂o, ̂𝑖) = 2πk4Φm(ks),
ks = k2 sin (θ∕2
),
(26.19)
and θ is the scattering angle between the incident wave in the direction ̂𝑖, unit vector,
and the scattering wave in the direction ̂o, unit vector.
Note that the correlation function Bn(rd) of the refractive index n(̄r) and its fluc-
tuating component n0n1 are shown in Section 23.1 and Ishimaru (1997).
n(̄r) = n0(1 + n1),
|n1| ≪1,
Bn(rd) = ⟨n1(r1)n1(r2)⟩,
rd = |̄r1 −̄r2|.
(26.20)
It is assumed that the medium is a homogeneous and isotropic random medium
and therefore the correlation function Bn(rd) is a function of the magnitude of the
difference rd. The spectrum is given by
̄Φn(k) =
1
(2π)3 ∫Bn(rd)e𝑖̄k∙̄rdd̄rd.
(26.21)
In this section, we use a Gaussian correlation function for Bn. Therefore we get

where l is the correlation distance. Using (26.22) in (26.18), we get
αs =
√
πk2l ⟨n2

⟩.
(26.23)
As the wave propagates over the distance L, the coherent component Icoh in (26.17)
attenuates as
exp(−αsL) = exp([−(L∕ls)] = exp(−τs).
(26.24)
where τs is called the “optical scattering depth,” and ls = (1∕αs) is called the
“scattering mean free path.” The optical scattering depth and the scattering mean
free path are the important key quantities to describe the amount of power scattered
by the medium.
The coherent component diminishes due to the scattering. This scattered power
is converted into the incoherent power. The total power is the sum of the coherent
and the incoherent intensity and this will be preserved. In particular, we have the
conservation of the energy.
∫
∞
r∕v
I(r, t)4πr2dt = W exp(−αar).
(26.25)
This shows that the total energy W, except for absorption, as a time integral of I(r, t),
is conserved. This includes the coda power.
Let us now examine the coherent Icoh and the incoherent intensities I𝑖ncoh in
(26.16). If the optical scattering depth τs shown in (26.24) is smaller or not much
greater than one, the coherent intensity decreases, but the increase of the incoherent
intensity due to scattering is small. If the optical scattering depth τs is much greater
than unity, the coherent intensity diminishes and is converted into the incoherent
intensity (Fig. 26.5).
Let us consider the incoherent intensity in (26.16). The coda is the incoherent
intensity as shown in Fig. 26.5 and is dominant as the optical scattering depth τs
becomes much greater than unity. The shape of the coda envelope has been studied
and for a medium with a Gaussian correlation function, the envelope shape takes
a universal form. Mathematical expressions have been given by Ishimaru (1997,
p. 316) and Sato and Fehler (1998, p. 250).

Note that as the optical scattering depth τs increases, the envelope stretches and the
wave train (coda) becomes longer. However, the total power is conserved so that the
integral (26.28) is unchanged, and the maximum value G(t)max decreases. The peak
arrival time tp is approximately given by
tp = 0.67tM.

S-WAVE CODA AND RAYLEIGH SURFACE WAVE
As shown in Fig. 26.3, P-waves and S-waves are the body waves. In Section 26.7, we
described P-wave propagation. We did not include the boundary effects. The complete
description of reflection and refraction of seismic pulse waves in homogeneous
earth with the surface of a half-space, without heterogeneities, have been studied
(Cagniard, 1962; de Hoop and van der Hijden, 1985). Complete solutions for a pulse
in heterogeneous earth with a boundary have not been reported. Rayleigh surface
waves have been extensively studied (Achenbach, 1980). Sato and Fehler (1998)
discuss a detailed study of seismic coda.
As noted in Fig. 26.4, a P-wave arrives first followed by an S-wave. This time
delay can be used to estimate the approximate distance to the hypocenter. If we have
approximate velocities of P- and S-waves, the time difference Δt between first arrival
time of the S-wave (r∕vs) and P-wave (r∕vp) is given by
r
[

]
= Δt.
(26.31)
This gives a circle centered at the observation point with radius r. If there are more than
two observing points, we can get the location of the hypocenter from the intersection
of the circles.
Appendix 26 gives a brief summary of the basic formulations of P- and S-waves
and Rayleigh waves.

u(z) = 0,
(3.A.1)
with q2(z) varying as shown in Fig. 3.26. We will discuss the field in the neighborhood
of the turning point z (region II). Here the WKB approximation fails, and we need
a different approach. In this region, let us expand q2(z) about the turning point in a
Taylor’s series and retain its first term
q2(z) = −a(z −z0),
(3.A.2)
where a is the slope at z0

Then the differential equation becomes
[

dz2 −a(z −z0)
]
u(z) = 0.
(3.A.3)
We now convert this into the Stokes differential equation by using
t = a1∕3(z −z0) = −a−2∕3q2(z),
(3.A.4)
and obtain
(

u(t) = 0.
(3.A.5)
This is Stokes equation, and the solution satisfying the radiation condition as t →∞
is given by (Appendix 3.B)
ua(t) = D0A𝑖(t),
(3.A.6)
where D0 is constant and Ai(t) is an Airy integral.
Let us examine the behavior of (3.A.6) toward region I. In this region, t is negative
and large as seen from (3.A.4), and therefore, asymptotically,

We let
̄P = ̂aG(̄r, ̄r′),
̄Q = ̄E(̄r),
(6.A.2)
where ̂a is a constant unit vector and G is the scalar Green’s function. We also have

FIGURE 6.A.1
Proof of Stratton–Chu formula.
Now we apply Green’s theorem to the volume V1 surrounded by St consisting of S1,
S, and S∞(Fig. 6.A.1). The surface S1 is the surface of a small sphere centered at ̄r′.
(Later, ̄r′ will be identified as the observation point and ̄r and ̄r′ will be interchanged.)
We wish to transform (6.A.1) into the form
̂a ⋅∫V1
⋯dV = ̂a ⋅∫St
⋯dS,
and obtain
∫V1
⋯dV = ∫St
⋯dS.
For this purpose, we examine the left side of (6.A.1). We note that
∇× ∇× ̄P = ∇× ∇× (̂aG)
= ∇(∇⋅̂aG) −∇2(̂aG)
= ∇(̂a ⋅∇G) + ̂ak2G,
̄E ⋅∇(̂a ⋅∇G) = ∇⋅( ̄E(̂a ⋅∇G) −̂a ⋅∇G(∇⋅̄E),
∫V1
∇⋅( ̄Êa ⋅∇G) dV = ∫St
̂a ⋅(∇G) ̄E ⋅̂n dS.
Therefore, we get
∫V1
̄Q ⋅∇× ∇× ̄P dV = ̂a ⋅∫St
(∇G)( ̄E ⋅̂n) dS + ̂a ⋅∫V1
(
k2G ̄E −ρ
ε∇G
)
dV.

STRATTON–CHU FORMULA
841
Similarly, we get
̄P ⋅∇× ∇× ̄Q = ̂aG ⋅∇× ∇× ̄E = ̂a ⋅G(k2 ̄E −jωμ̄J −∇× ̄Jm).
We also note that
G∇× ̄Jm = ∇× (ḠJm) + ̄Jm × ∇G
∫V1
∇× (ḠJm) dV = ∫St
̂n × ḠJmdS.
Therefore, the left-hand side of (6.A.1) becomes
L.H. = ̂a ⋅∫V1
(
−ρ
ε∇G + jωμ̄J + ̄Jm × ∇G
)
dV
+ ̂a ⋅∫St
[∇G( ̄E ⋅̂n) + ̂n × (ḠJm)] dS.
(6.A.4)
Now we examine the right-hand side of (6.A.1). We note that
̄P × ∇× ̄Q ⋅̂n = ̂aG × ∇× ̄E ⋅̂n
= ̂aG × (−jωμ ̄H −̄Jm) ⋅̂n
= ̂a ⋅[̂n × (jωμG ̄H + ḠJm)],
̄Q × ∇× ̄P ⋅̂n = ̄E × ∇× (̂aG) ⋅̂n
= ̂a ⋅(̂n × ̄E) × ∇G.
Therefore, the right side of (6.A.1) becomes
R.H. = ̂a ⋅∫St
[−(̂n × ̄E) × ∇G + jωμĜn × ̄H + ̂n × ḠJm] dS.
(6.A.5)
We now equate (6.A.4) to (6.A.5). We also interchange ̄r and ̄r′ so that the source
point is ̄r′ and the observation point is ̄r. We also use ̂n′ = −̂n. We then get
∫V1
̄EvdV′ + ∫St
̄EsdS′ = 0,
(6.A.6)
where ̄Es is given in (6.113) and ̄Ev is given by
̄Ev = −
(
jωμḠJ + ̄Jm × ∇′G −ρ
ε∇′G
)
,
(6.A.7)
where ̄J = ̄J(̄r′) and ̄Jm = ̄Jm(̄r′).

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 6
Similarly, for magnetic fields, we use the symmetry of Maxwell’s equations (6.A.3)
with the following interchanges of the field quantities:
̄E →̄H
ρ →ρm,
̄H →−̄E
ρm →−ρ,
̄J →̄Jm
ε →μ,
̄Jm →−̄J
μ →ε.
(6.A.8)
We then get
∫V1
̄Hv dV′ + ∫St
̄Hs dS′ = 0,
(6.A.9)
where ̄Hs is given in (6.113) and ̄Hv is given by
̄Hv = −
(
jωεḠJm −̄J × Δ′G −ρm
μ ∇′G
)
.
(6.A.10)
Note that the surface integral and the volume integral are in the same form if we
define the following:
̄Js = Surface current density = ̂n′ × ̄H,
̄Jms = Surface magnetic current density = −̂n′ × ̄E,
ρs = Surface charge density = ε(̂n′ ⋅̄E),
ρms = Surface magnetic charge density = μ(̂n′ ⋅̄H).
(6.A.11)
Now we apply (6.A.6) to the problem shown in Fig. 12.10. First, we consider
the case when the observation point ̄r is outside S (Fig. 6.15). Consider the integral
over S1.
∫S1
̄EsdS′ = −∫S1
[jωμĜn′ × ̄H −(̂n′ × ̄E) × ∇′G −(̂n′ ⋅̄E)∇′G] dS′.
(6.A.12)
S1 is the surface of a small sphere of radius ε centered at ̄r. As ε →0, the first term
contains only G, which varies as ε−1 and the surface is 4πε2, and therefore, this term
vanishes. The second and third terms, however, contain the gradient of G and thus
∇′G = −(4πε2)−1̂n′, and
lim
ε→0 ∫S1
̄Es hdS′ = lim
ε→0[(̂n × ̄E) × ̂n′ + ̂n′ ⋅̄Ên]

FIGURE 6.A.2
Observation point on the surface S.
The surface St consists of S1, S∞, and S. The integral over S∞vanishes as the fields
diminish satisfying the radiation condition. Thus we get
̄E(̄r) = ∫V1
̄Evdv′ + ∫S
̄EsdS′.
(6.A.14)
Now the volume integral over the source can be identified as the incident wave ̄E𝑖
because if we remove the object, the integral over S disappears and ̄E(̄r) should be
equal to the incident wave E𝑖(̄r). Therefore, we get (6.111),
̄E𝑖(̄r) + ∫S
̄EsdS′ = ̄E(̄r).
(6.A.15)
Similarly, we get
̄H𝑖(̄r) + ∫S
̄HsdS′ = ̄H(̄r).
If the observation point ̄r is on the surface S, we consider S, S2, and S – S2
(Fig. 6.A.2). It is easy to see that
∫S1
̄EsdS′ = −̄E(̄r),
∫S2
̄EsdS′ = +1

̄E(̄r).
(6.A.16)
Therefore, we get

̄HsdS′ = 1

̄H(̄r),
where ⨍S means the Cauchy principal value of the integral (over S – S2 as ε →0).
If the observation point ̄r is inside S, we can immediately obtain (6.112) by noting
that the volume integral in (6.A.6) is ̄E𝑖(̄r) and the surface integral is only on the
surface S.

PERIODIC GREEN’S FUNCTION
Consider a periodic structure with period l1 in the x direction and l2 in the y direction,
and consider one cell defined by 0 < x < l1, 0 < y < l2, and –∞≤z ≤+ ∞. Within
this cell, Green’s function G satisfies the following:
(∇2 + k2)G = −δ(x −x′)δ(y −y′)δ(z −z′).
(7.A.1)
Expanding G in Floquet series, we write
G =

gmn(z, z′)e−jαx−jβy,
(7.A.2)
where α = α0 + 2mπ/l1 and β = β0 + 2nπ/l2. Substituting this into (7.A.1) and noting
that

VARIATIONAL FORM
Note that in general we write
∫
b
a
dz ∫
b
a
dz′f ∗(z)G(z, z′, β)f(z′) = 0,
(7.B.1)
where G is Hermitian,
G(z, z′, β) = G∗(z′, z, β).
(7.B.2)
If the true f is not known, we use an approximate function fa = f + δf, where δf is
the variation. The corresponding propagation constant is βa = β + δβ + ⋅⋅⋅. If we
show that δβ = 0, the variation of β is of the second order and the error in βa is much
smaller than the error in fa. Thus we get the value of β close to the true value from
(7.B.1), even if we use a crude approximation for f.
Let us take the variation for (7.B.1). We get
∫
b

]
= 0,
and thus interchanging z and z′ in the second term and using (7.B.2), we get

dz′[δf ∗(z)G(z, z′, β)f(z′)

(7.B.3)
But at the correct value of f(z),
∫
b
a
dz′G(z, z′, β)f(z′) = 0,
and thus the second and third terms of (7.B.3) vanish, proving that δβ = 0.

EDGE CONDITIONS
847
7.C
EDGE CONDITIONS
In the neighborhood of a conducting wedge, electric and magnetic field components
behave in a particular manner dependent on the wedge angle. Let us consider a
conducting wedge whose angle is (2π – ϕ0) (Fig. 7.C.1). The field in the neighborhood
of the tip can be represented by two different modes: TM with Ez, Hϕ, and Hρ and
TE with Hz, Eϕ, and Eρ. The TM modes may be given by
(∇2 + k2)Ez = 0,
(7.C.1)
Hϕ =
1
jωμ
∂
∂ρEz,
and
Hρ = −1
jωμ

∂ϕEz.
(7.C.2)
A most general solution to (7.C.1) satisfying Ez = 0 at ϕ = 0 and ϕ0 is
Ez =
∞
∑
n=1
anZvn(kρ) sin vn ϕ,
vn = n π
ϕ0
,
(7.C.3)
and Zvn(ρ) is an appropriate Bessel function. Noting that vn ≠0 and noninteger, Zv(ρ)
can be either Jv(kρ) or J–v(kρ). For small kρ,
Jv(kρ) ∼ρv,
J−v(kρ) ∼ρ−v,
and thus taking the first term of (7.C.3) for small kρ, we get
Ez ∼ρv sin vϕ
or
ρ−v sin vϕ,
Hϕ ∼ρv−1 sin vϕ
or
ρ−v−1 sin vϕ,
(7.C.4)
and
Hρ ∼ρv−1 cos vϕ
or
ρ−v−1 cos vϕ
Now the choice between the two sets above must be resolved. This is done by noting
that the total energy in the vicinity of the edge must be finite.

(7.C.5)
Using the first set of (7.C.4), we get
P ∼(const.)ρ2v.
(7.C.6)
In order that P be finite as ρ →0, we require that v > 0. On the other hand, if we use
the second set of (7.C.4), we get
P ∼(const.)ρ−2v
0
.
(7.C.7)
For P to be finite, v must be negative, but this contradicts (7.C.3), and therefore this
must be rejected. Thus the behavior of the field in the vicinity of the edge is
Ez ∼ρv sin vϕ,
Hϕ ∼ρv−1 sin vϕ,
Hρ ∼ρv−1 cos vϕ
with
v = π
ϕ0
,
(7.C.8)
and the surface current density should behave as
Jz ∼ρv−1.
On the other hand, for TE modes, the same considerations lead to
Ez ∼C0 + C1ρv cos vϕ,
Hϕ ∼ρv−1 sin vϕ,
Hρ ∼ρv−1 cos vϕ
with
v = π
ϕ0
,
(7.C.9)
and the surface current behaves as
Jρ ∼C0 + Cv
1ρ.
Equations (7.C.8) and (7.C.9) represent the behavior of the field components in the
neighborhood of the edge.
As an example, take a knife edge (ϕ0 = 2π). Then
Ez ∼ρ1∕2
and
Hz ∼C0 + C1∕2

but all the other field components become infinite at the edge. For example, Eρ
behaves as
Eρ ∼

ρ1∕2 sin ϕ

and the current density on the surface becomes
Jz ∼Hρ ∼
1
ρ1∕2 .
Even though the field and the current density themselves become infinite at the edge,
the energy stays finite.
For a rectangular edge, ϕ0 = 3π/2, and thus
Eρ ∼

and
Jz ∼

In order to have the product AB, the matrices must be conformable, which

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 11
11.A
BRANCH POINTS AND RIEMANN SURFACES
Let us examine the solution (11.34) obtained in Chapter 11. In particular, it is impor-
tant to investigate the contour of the integration in more detail. To do this, we should
first note that the integrand contains λ =
√
k2 −h2, and this raises the question of
whether we should take λ = +
√
k2 −h2 or −
√
k2 −h2. To study this question in
more detail, we consider a more general complex function of a complex variable h.
W = f(h).
(11.A.1)
If f(h) is an analytic function within a region in the h plane, f(h) is a single-valued
function, and its value is uniquely determined by h (i.e., there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between W and h).
If f(h) is a multivalued function of h, however, there are many different values of
W for a given h. For example, letting W = y (real) and h = x (real), consider the case
where
y2 = x.
(11.A.2)
For a given value of x, there are two values of y : y1 = +
√
x and y2 = −
√
x
(Fig. 11.A.1). We may call y1 the first branch and y2 the second branch. The point
where these two branches meet is called the branch point.

Two branches.
By using these two branches y1 and y2, we can keep the different branches apart
so that we know exactly which branch we are dealing with. When W is a complex
function of a complex variable h, each branch is represented by a different complex
plane. We call these different planes of a multivalued function the Riemann surfaces.
On each Riemann surface, the function is single valued and its value is uniquely
determined.
Let us take an example.
W =
√
h.
(11.A.3)
Let us represent h, a complex variable, in the following polar form:
h = rejθ.
Then W is given by
W1 = r1∕2ej(θ∕2).
But this is not the only value of W. In the h plane, we can go around the origin and
thus add 2π to θ without changing the value of h.
h = rejθ = rej(θ+2π).
But this second form of h gives a different value of W.
W2 = r1∕2ej(θ∕2+π) = −W1.
If another 2π is added to θ, W will go back to W1.
h = rej(θ+4π),
W = rej(θ∕2+2π) = W1.

Therefore, for a given h, there are two W’s: W1 and W2. We note that to transfer
from W1 to W2, we must go around the origin once in the h plane. The origin in this
example is the branch point.
To describe this situation more clearly and to tell which of these two values W1
and W2, we are dealing with, we introduce the idea of the branch cut. In the h plane,
we imagine a cut extending from the branch point h = 0 to infinity. We say that as
long as we do not cross the branch cut, we are on the first branch (the first Riemann
surface), and the value of the function is W1. To get W2, we must cross the branch
cut. The branch cut can be drawn in any direction from the origin, and it need not
be a straight line. For convenience, we normally choose a cut along the negative real
axis (Fig. 11.A.2). According to this choice of the branch cut, we define
√
h =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪⎩
r1∕2ej(θ∕2) = W1
for −π < θ < π,
−r1∕2ej(θ∕2) = W2
for π < θ < 3π,
W1
for 3π < θ < 5π.
This situation is pictured in the two Riemann surfaces in Fig. 11.A.2. The top surface
represents W1 and the bottom surface W2. These two surfaces are put together at the
branch cut, indicating that when we cross the branch cut, W2 must be used. As the
branch cut is crossed the second time, we go back to the first Riemann surface and
obtain W1.
Another example of a multivalued function is
W = ln h.
We note that for a given h,
h = rejθ = rej(θ+2nπ).
We get an infinite number of W’s.
Wn = ln r + j(θ + 2nπ),
n = 0, ±1, ±2, … , ±∞.

Therefore, there are an infinite number of Riemann surfaces. As we go around the
branch point h = 0, we move to the next Riemann surface. This is pictured in
Fig. 11.A.3.
Now consider λ =
√
k2 −h2. We note that there are two branch points h =
+k and –k. We may have the branch cuts as shown in Fig. 11.A.4. The cut in
Fig. 11.A.4a is not acceptable on physical grounds. The cuts in both part (b) and
part (c) are acceptable. Cut (b) is along the line Re h = ± Re k and cut (c) is along
the curve Im λ = 0.
11.B
CHOICE OF THE CONTOUR OF INTEGRATION
AND THE BRANCH CUT
Equation (11.34) has the general form
I = ∫c
Cn(h)H(2)
n (λρ)e−jhzdh,
λ =
√
k2 −h2.
(11.B.1)
Because of λ =
√
k2 −h2, the integrand has two branch points at h = ± k.
In this section we show how the contour c in (11.B.1) should be drawn and will
discuss the reason for this choice. First, we note that due to the branch points, we
can have two Riemann surfaces, and therefore we must choose the contour in such a
www.ebook3000.com

CHOICE OF THE CONTOUR OF INTEGRATION AND THE BRANCH CUT
863
manner that the inverse transform (11.B.1) exists. This choice must be made on the
basis of physical argument.
First, we note that the integrand in (11.B.1) represents a wave with propagation
constant h in the z direction. At a large distance from the origin, we approximate the
Hankel function by
H(2)
n (z) =
√
2
πze−jz+j(2n+1)π∕4,
(11.B.2)
and we write
I ≈∫c
Cn(h)
√
2
πλρej(2n+1)π∕4−jλρ−jhzdh.
(11.B.3)
If this equation is to represent a physical situation, the wave represented by the
integrand must be an outgoing wave, and no wave should come back from infinity.
This is the so-called radiation condition.
To satisfy this condition, the branch must be chosen so that Λ is in the fourth
quadrant of the complex plane,
Re(λ) ≥0
and
Im(λ) ≤0,
(11.B.4)
because the positive real part represents the outgoing phase progression, and the
negative imaginary part represents the attenuation toward infinity.
e−jλρ = e−jλrρ+λ𝑖ρ,
(11.B.5)
where λ = λr + jλi and λr ≥0 and λi ≤0. Now the choice of the path of integration
and branch cut is made such that λ is always in the fourth quadrant.
Let us consider a point Q in the h plane (Fig. 11.B.1). We note that
h −k = r1ejθ1,
h + k = r2ejθ2.
(11.B.6)
Now consider λ.
λ1 =
√
k2 −h2 =
√
(k −h)(k + h)
=
√
−r1r2ej(θ1+θ2).
(11.B.7)
Because of the square root, we can have two values for λ.
λ1 = √r1r2ej(θ1+θ2)∕2−j(π∕2),
λ2 = √r1r2ej(θ1+θ2)∕2+j(π∕2).

Choice of contour.
Let us first determine which of these two, λ1 or λ2, satisfies the radiation condition.
To do this, let us consider a point Q1 on the contour between +k and –k. At Q1,
θ1 = π and θ2 = 0 and thus
λ1 = √r1r2
and
λ2 = √r1r2ejπ.
λ2 is not in the fourth quadrant, therefore λ1 must be chosen. Next consider the path
from Q1 to Q2 going around the branch point at +k as shown. Then at Q2, θ1 = 0 and
θ2 = 0, and therefore
λ1 = √r1r2e−j(π∕2),
which is in the fourth quadrant and satisfies the radiation condition.
On the other hand, if the path going from Q1 to Q′
2 is chosen, then at Q′
2, θ1 = 2π
and θ2 = 0. Thus at Q′
2,
λ1 = √r1r2ej(π∕2),
which is not in the fourth quadrant and does not satisfy the radiation condition.
In a similar manner, at Q3, θ1 = π and θ2 = –π and therefore,
λ1 = √r1r2e−j(π∕2),
www.ebook3000.com

CHOICE OF THE CONTOUR OF INTEGRATION AND THE BRANCH CUT
865
while at Q′
3,
λ1 = √r1r2ej(π∕2).
Thus to satisfy the radiation condition, the path Q3 – Q1 – Q2 must be chosen
(Fig. 11.B.1).
To ensure that the path of integration is as specified above, we draw branch cuts
from the branch points and require that the path of integration not cross the cuts.
We may have the cuts drawn vertically from the branch points (Fig. 11.A.4b) or any
other choice of the branch cuts is satisfactory, as long as the original contour does not
cross them. However, when we evaluate the integral, we must often deform the path
of integration in some convenient manner. Then since the path may move off the real
axis of the h plane, one choice of branch cuts is more convenient than the other.
One convenient choice of the cuts is to draw the cuts along the curve
Im(λ) = 0.
(11.B.9)
To clarify this situation, let us assume a small negative imaginary part of k.
k = kr + jk𝑖.
(11.B.10)
Since λ and h must satisfy the relation
λ2 + h2 = k2,
(11.B.11)
substituting (11.B.10) and λ = λr + jλi, and h = hr + jhi in (11.B.11) and equating
the real and imaginary parts of both sides, we obtain
λ2
r −λ2
𝑖+ h2
r −h2
𝑖= k2
r −k2
𝑖,
λrλ𝑖+ hrh𝑖= krk𝑖.
(11.B.12)
Now let us consider the condition Im(λ) = λi = 0. In this case we must have
λ2
r + h2
r −h2
𝑖= k2
r −k2
𝑖,
hrh𝑖= krk𝑖.
(11.B.13)
Equation (11.B.13) is an equation for a hyperbola going through the point h = k
(Fig. 11.5). We note that for the curve from +k to A, |kr| > |hr| and |hi| > |ki|, and
this satisfies (11.B.13) but for the curve from +k to B, |hr| > |kr| and |hi| < |ki| and
(11.B.13) cannot be satisfied. Thus the curve for Im(λ) = 0 should be drawn from +k
to A.
Similarly, the curve for the condition Re(λ) = 0 should be drawn from +k to B.
We need to keep in mind that this choice of the contour is based on the physical

866
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 11
consideration that the wave must satisfy the radiation condition. If other physical
situations are considered, the choice of the contour may be different.
For example, if h and ±k are replaced by ω and ±ω0, this represents a transient
wave in a waveguide or a magnetoplasma. In this case, the wave may be given by
u(x, t) = ∫c
A(ω)ejωt−jk(ω)xdω,
where
k(ω) =
[(ω
c
)2
−
(π
a
)2]1∕2
.
(11.B.14)
The physical consideration in this case is that no wave should propagate faster than
the light velocity, and thus u(x, t) = 0 for t < x/c. To ensure this condition, the contour
C should be drawn to include all the singularities on one side (Fig. 11.B.2).
Note that for |ω| large, we have
||||
ejωt−j(w∕c)√
1−(ω2p ∕ω2)x||||
⇒e−ωt(t−(x∕c)),
with ω = ωr + jωi, and this goes to zero along C–(ωi < 0) for t < x/c and thus,
since there are no singularities between C and C–, the integral along C is equal to the
integral along C–, which is zero. This is, of course, the same as the Laplace transform
(jω = S).
For spatial frequency h, there is no preferred direction, so the function should exist
for x < 0 as well as for x > 0. This is the basis for the choice in Figs. 11.4 and 11.5.

SADDLE-POINT TECHNIQUE AND METHOD OF STATIONARY PHASE

SADDLE-POINT TECHNIQUE AND METHOD
OF STATIONARY PHASE
The complex integrals appearing in Section 11.B.1, such as
I1 = ∫
∞
−∞
Cn(h)H(2)
n (
√
k2 −h2ρ)e−jhzdh,
(11.C.1)
are in general extremely difficult to evaluate. However, this evaluation can be done
quite easily for the field far from the source. This is usually referred to as the radiation
pattern and is one of the most important characteristics of radiating systems. The
technique used to obtain the radiation pattern is called the saddle-point technique.
This technique is useful not only for particular cylindrical problems but for many
other problems involving the evaluation of a contour integral. In this section we
describe this technique.
Let us consider the following complex integral:
I = ∫c
F(α) exp[Zf(α)]dα,
(11.C.2)
where Z is a large positive real number and f(α) and F(α) are complex functions of
the complex variable α. F(α) is a slowly varying function of α. Writing f = fr + jfi,
we get
eZf(α) = eZfr(cos Zf𝑖+ j sin Zf𝑖).
(11.C.3)
Therefore, for a large Z, as fi varies along the contour, the integrand oscillates very
rapidly, and the evaluation of the integral would be extremely difficult.
However, there is a way to avoid this difficulty. If we deform the original contour
in such a manner that the imaginary part fi is constant along the new path, there is no
rapid oscillation of the integrand. In this case, exp[Zf(α)] varies slowly as exp(Zfr)
starts from zero, attains some value, and declines to zero again at the end of the
contour.
The point in the complex plane where the real part becomes maximum should be
the saddle point, as will be shown below. To study the behavior of f(α) near this point,
let us first consider a point α = αs where
df(α)
dα
= 0.
(11.C.4)
We expand f(α) about this point,
f(α) = f(αs) + (α −αs)f ′(αs) + (α −αs)2
2!
f ′′(αs) + ⋯,
(11.C.5)

868
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 11
and in the neighborhood of α = αs, we can neglect the higher-order terms. Thus we
get
f(α) = f(αs) + (α −αs)2
2!
f ′′(αs).
(11.C.6)
We note that as the angle of α – αs increases, the corresponding increase of the angle
of f(α) – f(αs) is twice that for α – αs, and thus the angle π/2 in the α plane around αs
corresponds to π in the f plane.
The valley region, where fr(α) < fr(αs) in the f plane, is represented by two regions
in the α plane about the saddle point. The mountain region fr(α) > fr(αs) is also
represented by two regions in the α plane, and these four regions meet at the saddle
point, each occupying the angle of π/2.
It is then clear that the point α = αs is the saddle point as shown in Fig. 11.C.1.
This is also clear considering that f(α) is an analytic function. An analytic function

cannot have maxima or minima within the range of analyticity. This situation is math-
ematically identical to two-dimensional electrostatic problems. A two-dimensional
electrostatic potential U and a flux function V can be represented by an analytic
function W = U + jV and U and V satisfy the Laplace equations, and it is clear that
there is no maximum potential U in the region of analyticity. Only a singularity such
as the electric charge can create maximum or minimum potentials. A point where
∂f/∂α = 0 is therefore a saddle point.
We now wish to deform the original contour into the path along which the imagi-
nary part fi is constant. As can be seen from Fig. 11.C.1, there are two perpendicular
lines (SA+ and SA–) in the α plane along which fi is constant. The path (SA+) goes up
the mountains on both sides of the saddle point, and the other (SA–) goes down to the
valleys on both sides. Obviously, the deformed path should be chosen to originate in
one valley, cross the saddle point, and terminate in the other valley. This is the path
A––S–A–. As we note in Fig. 11.C.1, this path of constant fi is in fact the path along
which the real part fr decreases fastest from the saddle point. Thus the path is called
the steepest descent path, and the saddle-point technique is often called the method
of steepest descent.
Let us evaluate the integral along this steepest descent contour (SDC):
I = ∫SDC
F(α)eZf(α)dα.
(11.C.7)
We write
f(α) = f(αs) + (α −αs)2
2!
f ′′(αs),
where
df
dα = 0
at α = αs saddle point.
First, we assume that F(α) is a slowly varying function, and that its value near αs is
almost constant. Then, approximately, we get
I = F(αs)eZf(αs)
∫SDC
exp
[
Z (α −αs)2
2!
f ′′(αs)
]
dα.
(11.C.8)
To study the exponent in the integral, let us note that along the contour of the
constant phase, the imaginary part should be constant and equal to its value at αs.
f𝑖(α) = f𝑖(αs).
(11.C.9)

870
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 11
Therefore, along the path, we have
Re f(α) = Ref(αs) + (α −αs)2
2!
f ′′(αs).
Now we note that Ref(α) must decrease from the value at the saddle point Ref(αs)
and therefore the path must be chosen such that
(α −αs)2
2!
f ′′(αs)
must be not only real, but also negative. This choice can be made by properly orienting
the path. We let
α −αs = sejΓ,
where s is the distance measured from the saddle point and γ is the angle the path
makes with the real axis. The exponent can be expressed by
Z(α −αs)2
2
f ′′(αs) = Z s2
2 ej2γf ′′(αs)
= −Z[−ej2γf ′′(αs)]

s2.
We now choose γ such that
[−ej2Γf ′′(αs)] = P
is real and positive. With this choice, P is equal to | f ′′(αs)|. Then the integral becomes
I = F(αs)eZf(αs)
∫SDC
exp
(

ds.
(11.C.10)
This integral is in the form of the integral of a Gaussian curve, and for large Z,
the integrand drops down very rapidly on both sides of s = 0. Therefore, the most
contribution comes from the neighborhood of s = 0. Thus we approximate the integral
by integrating over a small distance about s = 0.

(11.C.11)
where γ is chosen to make [ej2γ f′′(αs)] real and negative, and ∂f(αs)/∂α = 0. Equation
(11.C.11) is the final result of the approximate evaluation of the integral based on the
method of steepest descent (the saddle-point technique) valid for large Z. There are
two choices for γ. For example, if f′′ has an angle of 1
2π, then 2γ + 1
2π = ±π, and we
get γ = π/4 or –3π/4. The choice can be made by noting the path of integration (see
Section 11.5).
We made several assumptions and approximations in deriving the result of the
saddle-point integration. For example, we assumed that F(α) is a slowly varying
function of α near α = αs, and we approximated F(α) by F(αs). We did not define
what is meant by “slowly varying.” We expanded f(α) in a Taylor’s series and retained
the first two terms. But what must be done if f′′(αs) = 0? How do we justify taking
the first two terms? Also, in one process we integrated from –ε to +ε under the
assumption that the main contribution comes from this region. A more complete
treatment must be done through the use of Watson’s lemma.
Also, we did not account for the presence of singularities between the original
contour and the deformed saddle-point contour. If the poles are present between these
two contours, they may give rise to “surface waves” and “leaky waves.” Furthermore,
when the pole is close to the saddle point, we need a modified saddle-point technique.
Wave propagation over the earth excited by a dipole, which is often referred to as a
Sommerfeld problem, requires this technique. Also, the existence of a branch point
may give rise to lateral waves. These are discussed in Chapter 15.
The method of stationary phase is equivalent to the method of steepest descent.
As seen in Fig. 11.C.1, the steepest descent path is along the constant fi(SA+, SA–).

Obviously, γ = γ′ + π/4, and the method of steepest descent and the method
of stationary phase give the same result. The method of stationary phase is used,
for example, to study reflections from curved surfaces where the main contribution
comes from the portion of the reflector where the phase variation is stationary.
The method of stationary phase is usually used when the integral is expressed in
the following form:
I = ∫c
F(α)ejZg(α)dα.
(11.C.15)
The stationary phase point α = αs is then given by
∂
∂αg(α) = 0.

COMPLEX INTEGRALS AND RESIDUES
This appendix gives a short summary of important definitions and theorems for
complex functions.
1. Analytic functions w = f(z), z = x + jy. If f(z) possess a derivation at z = z0 and
in its neighborhood, then f(z) is called the analytic function.
2. If w = f(z) = u(x, y) + jv(x, y) is analytic, then u and v satisfy the Cauchy–
Riemann equation.
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y,
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x.
(11.D.1)
Combining these two, we get
∇2u = 0
and
∇2v = 0.
(11.D.2)
The real part and the imaginary part of an analytic function satisfy the two-
dimensional Laplace equation.
3. Cauchy’s integral theorem. If f(z) is analytic in a domain D, then for every
closed path C in D (Fig. 11.D.1)
∮f(z)dz = 0.

f(z) = f(a) + f ′(a)(z −a) + f ′′(a)(z −a)2

(11.D.5)
The radius of convergence of the series is the distance from a to the nearest
singularity of f(z).

Laurent series,

This is valid in the domain 0 < |z – a| < R, where R is the distance from a to
the nearest singularity of f(z). The coefficient C–1 is called the residue of f(z) at
z = a.
7. If f(z) has a simple pole at a, the residue is given by
c−1 = lim
z→a(z −a)f(z)

where f(z) = N(z)/D(z).

The integral I (̄r),

(12.A.1)
is called the improper integral if f(̄r, ̄r′) becomes unbounded at a point ̄r′ = ̄r within
the volume V. The integral I (̄r) is convergent if

The integral is convergent because (∂/∂n)G0 is zero near ̄r = ̄r′ and z = 0.

INTEGRAL EQUATIONS
Integral equations are classified as follows:
1. Fredholm integral equation of the first kind.
∫
b
a
K(x, x′)f(x′) dx′ = g(x),
(12.B.1)
where K(x, x′) is a known function called the kernel function. f(x′) is the
unknown and g(x) is the given function. The solution depends greatly on the
kernel function. Laplace transform is an example.

(12.B.3)
For a more general kernel function, analytical solution is difficult to obtain.

k(x, x′)f(x′) dx′ = f(x) + g(x).

K(x, x′)f(x′)dx′ = λf(x).

This constitutes an eigenvalue equation where Λ is the eigenvalue.
4. In the above, if the upper limit b is replaced by the variable x, this is called the
Volterra integral equation. For example, the Volterra integral equation of the
first kind is given by
∫

K(x, x′)f(x′) dx′ = g(x).

SOMMERFELD’S SOLUTION
Sommerfeld’s 1909 paper contains an error in sign for √p1 (which is essentially –sp
instead of + sp, and this –sp corresponds to the pole on the bottom Riemann surface
in the α plane). If we deliberately change √p1 to −√p1 in (15.63), we get
πer = 2e−jkR
4πR
[1 + j√p1πe−p1 erfc(−j√p1)] .
(15.A.1)
Using
erfc(−z) = 2 −erfc(z),
we write
πer = 2e−jkR
4πR
[1 −j√p1πe−p1 erfc (+j√p1
) + 2j√p1πe−p1] ,
which differs from the correct π in (15.63) as follows:
πer = π + 2e−jkR
4πR
(2j√p1πe−p1)] .

FIGURE 15.A.1
Branch cut integration and residue.
It is easy to show that the foregoing difference between πer and π is precisely equal
to –2πj (the residue at the Sommerfeld pole, sp). Thus we write
π = πer −(−2πj ⋅residue at sp).
(15.A.3)
Now, in his 1909 paper, Sommerfeld evaluated the integral in the following form:
πer = Bq + Bqe + (−2πj ⋅residue at sp),
(15.A.4)
where Bq and Bqe are the branch cut integration along Imq = 0 and Imqe = 0,
respectively (Fig. 15.A.1).
Now the term
(−2πj)(residue at sp),
is precisely the Zenneck wave excited by the dipole source. But because of the sign
error, the true field is πer minus the Zenneck wave. Thus it appeared that the Zenneck
wave contained in Sommerfeld’s 1909 paper disappears if the correct sign is used.
Therefore, it appears that the Zenneck wave does not exist.
As we pointed out earlier, this division (15.A.4) is arbitrary, and the fact that one
term exhibits the Zenneck wave characteristic does not mean that the wave exists. In
fact, the question of the existence of a wave based on one term of the total wave is
meaningless, because what is important is the total wave, not a portion of the wave.
However, this sign error created controversies over the existence of the Zenneck wave
for many decades (see Banos, 1966, p. 154). This error in sign was not detected until
1935 by Norton, even though Sommerfeld has the correct sign in his 1926 paper. The
entire question of the controversies was finally resolved around 1950 through work
of van der Waeden, Ott, and Banos (see Banos, 1966).
15.B
RIEMANN SURFACES FOR THE SOMMERFELD PROBLEM
In the book, the evaluation of the integral was performed in the α plane. It is instructive
to see how the integration and the various Riemann surfaces may appear in the γ plane.

RIEMANN SURFACES FOR THE SOMMERFELD PROBLEM
887
In the γ plane, the branch points appear at
γ = ±k
and
γ = ±ke.
(15.B.1)
Let us now draw the branch cuts from these branch points along
Im q = Im
√
k2 −λ2 = 0,
and
Im qe = Im
√
k2
e −λ2 = 0.
(15.B.2)
As shown in Chapter 15, these branch cuts are hyperbolas passing through the
branch points. It is obvious that the contour of the integration must be on the Riemann
surface where
Im q < 0
and
Im qe < 0.
(15.B.3)
In this case, the wave attenuates as z →+ ∞and z →–∞and thus satisfies the
radiation condition.
|e−jqz| = e(Im q)z →0
as z →+∞,
|ejqez| = e−(Im qe)z →0
as z →−∞.
This surface is therefore called the proper Riemann surface.
In addition, however, there are three other Riemann surfaces on which the radia-
tion condition is not satisfied, and therefore these are called the improper Riemann
surfaces. We list these four Riemann surfaces:
I. Proper Riemann surface:
Im q < 0, Im qe < 0.
II. Improper Riemann surface: Im q > 0, Im qe < 0.
III. Improper Riemann surface: Im q < 0, Im qe > 0.
IV. Improper Riemann surface: Im q > 0, Im qe > 0.
The first two belong to Im qe < 0 and the last two belong to Im qe > 0. Let us
consider the first two surfaces. We first examine the complex q plane (Fig. 15.B.1).
We label each quadrant as B2, B1, T2, and T1. T1 and T2 belong to the top surface (I)
and B1 and B2 belong to the bottom surface (II) in the Λ plane. The corresponding α
plane can be obtained by noting that
λ = k sin α
and
q = k cos α.
As we go around in the q plane from A to B to C to D, we can trace the corresponding
locus in surfaces I and II of the Λ plane and the α plane (Fig. 15.B.1). Note that in

the α plane, T1, T2, B1, and B2 are placed side by side, and the branch point λ = + k
in the λ plane is the regular point α = π/2 in the α plane.
Now let us picture the four Riemann surfaces in the Λ plane (Fig. 15.B.2). Close
examination of the Sommerfeld poles reveals that under this branch cut, the poles
are on Riemann surfaces I and IV. In the α plane there are only two surfaces, one
corresponding to surfaces I and II and the other corresponding to surfaces III and IV.
The Sommerfeld poles are then on the top and bottom sheets in the α plane as shown
in Fig. 15.B.3. We now describe one of the confusions concerning the location of the
Sommerfeld pole. We write two different branch cuts below (case A and case B in
Fig. 15.B.4).

and there is no contribution from the pole PB, because PB is on II. Thus it appears
that case A gives the extra term due to the pole, and case A and case B give two
different answers. Note also that the residue has all the characteristics of the Zenneck
wave and thus it appears that case A yields the Zenneck wave, whereas case B does
not.

All these apparent contradictions are of course nonexistent. The branch cuts are
drawn for convenience only, and both case A and case B should give the identical
result. In fact, we can show that (the integral along C∞is zero) there is a difference
between the branch cut integration for A and for B and this difference is exactly equal
to the residue term, that is,
∫Br A1
+ ∫Br A2
+2πj ⋅residue = ∫Br B1

In the text, the integration was performed in the α plane, where Riemann surfaces I
and II are placed side by side and thus the confusion between locations PA and PB
never arises in the α plane.

Let us consider an integral
I0 = ∫c
F(α) exp[zf(α)] dα,
(15.C.1)
where z is a large positive number and F(α) has a pole at αp, which may be located
at any part of the α plane.
We first find the saddle point α = αs from
∂f(α)
∂α
||||αs

(15.C.2)
and write (15.C.1) as follows:
I0 = ezf(αs)

Let us transform (15.C.3) into the following form using the transformation from α

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 15
The transformation (15.C.4) is possible if the saddle point is an isolated one. We note
that in (15.C.5) the saddle point is at s = 0, and the steepest descent contour (SDC) is
along the real axis of s. This is pictured in Fig. 15.8 using the following example:
f(α) = −j cos(α −θ),
s = 2e−j(π∕4) sin α −θ

,
dα
ds =

ej(π∕4).
(15.C.6)
Because of dα/ds, two branch points (Br1 and Br2) appear at s = ± 2e−j(π/4) in the s
plane, but these branch points are far from the saddle point and have little effect on
the integral.
Now we evaluate (15.C.5) for the following two cases:
1. F(α) has no pole. Let us first obtain the solution for a simpler case, where there
is no pole in the integrand. In this case we can deform the contour from C to
SDC.
∫c
ds = ∫

(15.C.7)
Now we expand F(s)dα/ds in a Taylor’s power series.

where we separated the even and odd powers for convenience.
Substituting (15.C.8) into (15.C.5), we note that the odd terms of (15.C.8)
become zero. Thus
I0 = ezf(αs)

(15.C.12)
The first term,

√

z ,
is the result obtained from the usual saddle-point technique shown in
Appendix 11.C, and (15.C.12) is the asymptotic series in inverse power of
z. The series on the right side of (15.C.12), which was obtained by term-by-
term integration (15.C.10), is in general divergent. However, it is an asymptotic
series having the following characteristics.
If we take the partial sum
fN =
N
∑
n=0
An,
then the error (I0 – fN) is smaller in absolute value than the first term neglected
(AN + 1):
|I0 −fN| < |AN+1|.
Usually, |An| becomes smaller at first and then eventually gets larger and the
series diverges.
Alternatively, I0 in (15.C.6) can be evaluated numerically along the real axis
of s using the Gauss quadrature technique.
2. F(α) has a pole. Now we come to our main problem. When F(α) has a pole at
αp, or s = sp in the s plane, Taylor’s expansion (15.C.9) is valid only within a
www.ebook3000.com

894
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 15
circle whose radius (called the radius of convergence) is the distance from the
origin to |sp|.
|s| < |sp|.
If the pole is close to the saddle point, |sp| is very small. In order to extend the region
of Taylor’s expansion, we first write F(s) dα/ds as a sum of the term with a pole and
the term that is regular at s = sp.
F(s)dα
ds =
R1(sp)
s −sp
+ G1(s).
(15.C.13)
R1(sp) is the residue at s = sp. Note also that the residue of the integrand F(α)exp[zf(α)]
at the pole α = αp is given by
R(Ap) = R1(sp) exp[zf(αp)].
(15.C.14)
To show this, let F(α) = N(α)/D(α) and note that
R1(sp) =
[ N(s)
∂D∕∂s
dα
ds
]
s=sp
=
N(α)
∂D∕∂α
||||α=αp
.
The evaluation of the integral must now be done differently depending on whether
the pole is below or above the original contour.
It is clear that the integral along the original contour C can now be deformed along
the saddle-point contour (SDC). If the pole is located below the SDC, then
∫C
= ∫SDC
.
(15.C.15)
But if the pole is located above the SDC, we have
∫C
= ∫SDC
−2πjR(sp),
(15.C.16)
where R(sp) is the residue of F(α)exp[–zf(α)] at sp shown in (15.C.14). We combine
(15.C.15) and (15.C.16) and write
∫C
= ∫SDC
−2πjR(sp) U (Imsp),
(15.C.17)

where U(x) is a unit step function. Next we evaluate the integral along the SDC.

(15.C.20)
The evaluation of (15.C.19) can be made as follows. Write

(15.C.21)
where
y(z) = ∫

e−z(s2∕2)

(15.C.22)
To evaluate y(z) it is necessary to reduce the integral (15.C.21) to a known integral. In
this case because of the form of (15.C.22), it is possible to convert (15.C.22) into an
error integral. To do this, we first multiply y(z) by exp[zs2
p∕2] and take the derivative
with respect to z.

The original integral I0 in (15.C.5) is, therefore, given by

(15.C.28)
Note that the discontinuity in I0 in (15.C.27) will be exactly canceled by the last term
of (15.C.28), and thus we finally obtain the following.

Consider a wave field U(̄r) satisfying the wave equation

We let

(16.B.2)
and get Riccati’s equation for Ψ(̄r)
∇2Ψ + ∇Ψ ⋅∇Ψ + k2n2 = 0.
(16.B.3)
Also we consider U0 when n = 1.
U0 = exp(Ψ0),
∇2Ψ0 + ∇Ψ0 ⋅∇Ψ0 + k2 = 0.
(16.B.4)
We now let
Ψ = Ψ0 + Ψ′,
(16.B.5)
and subtracting (16.B.4) from (16.B.3), we get
∇2Ψ′ + 2∇Ψ0 ⋅∇Ψ′ = −[∇Ψ′ ⋅∇Ψ′ + k2(n2 −1)].
(16.B.6)
Now using the identity
∇2[U0Ψ′] = [∇2U0)Ψ′ + 2U0∇Ψ0 ⋅∇Ψ′ + U0∇2Ψ′,
the left side of (16.B.6) becomes

g(t) = ∫

f(τ)
(t −τ)α dτ,
0 < α < 1,
(16.C.1)
where g′(t) is continuous. g(t) is a given function of t and f(τ) is the unknown function
to be determined. We will show that the solution to (16.C.1) is given by
f(τ) = sin πα

g(t) = ∫
t
0
K(t −τ)f(τ)dτ,
(16.C.4)
where K(τ) = τ−α.
We can solve this by using the Laplace transform:
̄g(s) = +g(t),
̄K(s) = +K(t),
̄f(s) = +(f(t)).
(16.C.5)

ABEL’S INTEGRAL EQUATION

We then get

(16.C.6)
Therefore, we get
f(t) = +−1

.
The Laplace transform ̄K(s) is given by
̄K(s) = +(τ−α) = Γ(1 −α)

f(τ)dτ =

COMPLEX GAUSSIAN VARIABLES, CIRCULARITY,
AND MOMENT THEOREM
In most problems of propagation and scattering, we deal with complex random
variables. We also make the assumption that these complex variables are Gaussian.
Even though real Gaussian variables are well known and defined (Davenport and
Root 1958), the characteristics of complex Gaussian variables are often not carefully
stated. Normally, complex Gaussian variables are expressed by the covariance matrix.
Consider a complex random function u, its average ⟨u⟩and its fluctuation v.
u = ⟨u⟩+ v,
⟨v⟩= 0.
(23.A.1)
The covariance C of the fluctuation is given by
C = ⟨v1v∗
2
⟩.
(23.A.2)
However, the covariance cannot completely describe the properties of v. We need
another quantity Cp given by
Cp = ⟨v1v2⟩.

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 23
Cp is called the pseudo-covariance. The function Cp is rarely introduced in many
problems, and is often assumed to be zero. The processes with vanishing pseudo-
covariance are called “proper” or “circular” (Goodman, 1985; Neeser, 1993; Ollida,
2008; Picinbono, 1996).
If a complex Gaussian, zero-mean stationary process is assumed to be circular, we
have
⟨v1v∗
2
⟩≠0
and
⟨v1v2⟩= 0.
(23.A.4)
For this process, a general moment theorem can be stated (Reed, 1962). The
moment theorem for a real Gaussian zero-mean process z is well known (Middleton,
1960).
⟨z1z2z3z4⟩= ⟨z1z2⟩⟨z3z4⟩+ ⟨z2z3⟩⟨z1z4⟩+ ⟨z1z3⟩⟨z2z4⟩.
(23.A.5)

⟨
|v|2n⟩= n! (⟨
|v|2⟩)n .
(23.A.7)
Furthermore, we have
⟨v1v2⟩= 0,
⟨v1v2v∗

Making use of (23.A.6) and (23.A.7), we have

WAVE PROPAGATION IN ELASTIC SOLID AND RAYLEIGH
SURFACE WAVES
The equations governing the linearized theory of elasticity for a homoge-
neous, isotropic medium are given by Achenbach (1980), Redwood (1960), and
Brekhovskikh (1970). Here we give a summary of the equations in the Cartesian
coordinate system.
The wave propagation in elastic solids such as the earth can be expressed by the
scalar potential ϕ representing the pressure wave (P-wave, longitudinal wave), and
the vector potential Îψ representing the shear wave (S-wave, transverse wave). These
two potentials satisfy the wave equation

λ and μ are Lam´e constants (N∕m2), and ρ is density (kg∕m3). Clearly cp > cs.
Note that in a fluid, μ = 0 and only a P-wave is possible. The displacement vector
̄u can be given in terms of ϕ and Îψ.
̄u = ûx + v̂y + ŵz

The stress tensor τ is related to the strain tensor ε and can be given in terms of ϕ
and Îψ. In terms of ϕ and Îψ, we have the displacement vector ̄u.

TWO-DIMENSIONAL CASE, RAYLEIGH SURFACE WAVE
909
Let us now consider the boundary conditions between two media. We first start
with the fluid–fluid interface. We have
1) Fluid–fluid interface
(a) Pressure = Continuous
(b) Normal displacement = Continuous
(26.A.5)
2) Fluid–vacuum interface
(a) Pressure = 0
(26.A.6)
3) Fluid–rigid wall interface
(a) Normal velocity = 0
(26.A.7)
These are well-known boundary conditions that have been discussed for acoustic
propagation with a fluid–fluid interface (Section 2.12).
For interface with a solid, we need to include the displacement and the stress. We
have
1. Solid–solid interface
(a) All displacement = continuous
(normal and tangential displacement)
(b) All stress = continuous
(normal stress τzz and tangential stress τxz and τyz)
(26.A.8)
2. Solid–fluid interface
(a) Tangential stress = 0
(b) Normal component of stress = continuuous
(c) Normal component of stress displacement = continuous
(26.A.9)
3. Solid–vacuum interface
(a) Normal stress = 0 (τzz = 0)
(b) Tangential stress = 0 (τxz = τyz = 0)
(26.A.10)
Here, a Cartesian system shown in Fig 26.B.1 is used.
26.B
TWO-DIMENSIONAL CASE, RAYLEIGH SURFACE WAVE
For the two-dimensional case (∂∕∂y = 0), there is no displacement in the y direction;
thus v = 0 and therefore ψx = ψz = 0.
A surface wave can exist along the solid–vacuum interface. This is called the
Rayleigh surface wave. - See Fig 26.B.1. The boundary conditions are given in Eq.

(26.B.1)
We write ϕ and ψy in the following form:
ϕ = A exp[𝑖klz + 𝑖kxx],
ψy = B exp[𝑖ktz + 𝑖kxx],
(26.B.2)
where
k2
t = k2
s −k2

k2
l = k2
p −k2

Note that the Rayleigh surface wave exists if the velocities cp, cs, and cr satisfy
the following:
cp > cs > cr,
(26.B.3)
where kp = ω
cp
, ks = ω
cs
, and kx = ω
cr
are the wave numbers of the pressure wave
(P-wave), the shear wave (S-wave), and the Rayleigh surface wave.
In view of (26.B.3), we get
kp < ks < kr.
(26.B.4)
Therefore k2
t .and .k2
l in (26.B.2) are negative and kt and kl are imaginary.

TWO-DIMENSIONAL CASE, RAYLEIGH SURFACE WAVE
911
The Rayleigh wave decays exponentially away from the surface.
e𝑖klz = e−αlz,
e𝑖ktz = e−αtz.
(26.B.5)
We now substitute (26.B.2) into (26.B.1). We get
αA + βB = 0,
δA + γB = 0,
(26.B.6)
where
α = λ(−k2
p) + 2μ(−k2
l )
= −μ(k2
s −2k2
x),
β = −2μktkx,
δ = 2μ[−kxkl],
γ = μ[k2
s −2k2
x
].
To obtain the constants α, β, δ, and γ, we make use of the following:
(λ + 2μ) k2
p = μk2
s .
(26.B.7)
A nonzero solution of (26.B.6) is obtained if the determinant of the coefficients is
zero

(26.B.8)

(26.B.9)
Note that cr = velocity of the Rayleigh wave, and cs and cp are the velocities of the
shear wave and the pressure wave shown in (26.A.1). The frequency does not appear
in (26.B.9) and therefore the Rayleigh surface wave is nondispersive.
