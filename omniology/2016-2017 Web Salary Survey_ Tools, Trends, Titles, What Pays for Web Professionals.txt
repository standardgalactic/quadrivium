OVER 2,000

OF INDUSTRIES 
COMPLETED 
THE SURVEY
2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON DATA collected through 
an online, 56-question survey, including demographic 
information, time spent on specific data-related tasks, 
and the use/non-use of a broad range of software tools. 

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
THE WEB IS A MAJOR EMPLOYER for computer program­
mers and designers. Many people see the web as their big 
chance at a career that is both lucrative and fulfilling—witness 
the enormous number of companies that offer courses in 
various types of web development, and the large numbers of 
applicants from whom they can choose their student bodies.
The World Wide Web began as an interlinked system for 
sharing hypertext documents amongst a small community 
of scientists. Three decades later, the web is everywhere. It’s 
your desktop browser, your phone, an app on your tablet, a 
ticketing kiosk at the airport, your television, and even in your 
car. The web has grown up and it moves incredibly fast. 
In its early days, JavaScript was mostly used to glue things 
together in the browser. Fifteen years later, things are much 
different. JavaScript is one of the most popular and in-­
demand programming languages, and HTML5, CSS, and 
other core technologies making up the modern web have 
matured with it.
The web also occupies an interesting space in the field of 
software development as it proves a welcoming entry point 
for beginning programmers and subsequently a space for 
advancement and specialization. The speed of change in web 
development, in terms of favored tooling, techniques, and 
standards, allows for much innovation in a vibrant ecosystem 
of developers. It also presents some challenges for those trying 
to keep up, or those trying to survey the field, for instance. 
So what can you earn as a web developer? How does the 
type of job, the language you use, or your geographic loca­
tion affect your salary? That’s what this report, based on a 
survey of more than 2,000 developers, tries to establish.
For the past few years, O’Reilly Media has conducted world­
wide salary surveys of people working in the computer field. 
Following a general survey of all computing positions, we 
reached out to those doing web work in order to produce 
this report.
In the survey, respondents shared details about themselves, 
the companies they work for, and their roles. We asked for 
specifics regarding age, number of years in the field, job 
description, number of work hours, etc. One of the most 
interesting parts of the report, we think, concerns tools, 
programming languages, and platforms. These have a major 
impact on salary.

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
OF COURSE, OUR METHODS ARE INEXACT, and you 
should be aware of several ways in which this report may fail 
to reflect reality:
•	 The sample size may sometimes be inadequate. Although 
2,000 is a large number of people and worth drawing 
conclusions from, the conclusions become less reliable as 
we break down the respondents into groups that use a 
particular tool.
•	 We had to group people who differ in known ways. 
For instance, we sometimes lumped together people 
in different countries to get a sample large enough 
to be meaningful, and obviously, salaries will vary in 
different places.
•	 The respondents are self-chosen, not a random sample. 
They are likely to be people who use O’Reilly Media 
products and resources, and might not reflect the field as 
a whole.
•	 Because we depend on what respondents say about 
themselves, we have to trust them to be accurate and 
objective. Some questions are deliberately subjective—for 
instance, we ask respondents to rate their own ability to 
negotiate for a higher salary.
•	 The data behind this report was collected in March and 
April of 2016. Technical fields change quickly, and it has 
been more than six months since the respondents filled 
out their surveys.
•	 Respondents in the web area vary a great deal in both 
responsibilities and skills. There is also a great deal of 
churn in the field, and part-timers.
With these caveats in mind, let’s see what our data tells us.
Limitations

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
THE MEDIAN SALARY IS $78,000 (we use US dollars for all 
money in this report). Naturally, there is a lot of variation, but 
75% of respondents had a salary of at least $50,000, and 25% 
had a salary of at least $109,000. Things are changing fast, 
though: salaries rise quickly. 17% of respondents reported a 
salary raise of 20% to 30% over the past three years. The salary 
raises also form a bell curve around this 17%. For instance, 
although 5% reported a decrease in salary, 16% reported that 
their salaries had doubled, or even done better, over three years.
The United States paid the highest salaries, with the average 
being $98,000. Canada was also pretty high, with a median 
of $79,000 (in US dollars), and Australia/New Zealand at 
$74,000. Compensation drops off rapidly after that:
•	 UK and Ireland: average of $62,000
•	 Rest of Europe: average of $43,000
•	 Africa: average of $23,000 (but there was a rather high 
top quartile of $41,000)
•	 Asia: average of $21,000 (with a high top quartile of 
$47,000)
•	 Latin America: average of $21,000 (with a high top 
quartile of $44,000)
The top quartile means that 25% of respondents earned more 
than the amount listed. Of course, countries differ in taxation 
and the benefits they offer, so salaries have somewhat differ­
ent meanings in different countries.
Because we got a lot of respondents from the US, we could 
break them down by region. High salaries in California are no 
surprise (particularly given the cost of living there), but the 
high average in Southwest/Mountain states is rather unex­
pected. (This category does not include California, which has 
its own category.) Utah, with a large web developer commu­
nity, as well as Colorado and Arizona all saw high salaries.
•	 California: average of $120,000
•	 Northeast: average of $105,000
•	 Southwest/Mountain: average of $102,000
•	 Pacific Northwest: average of $98,000
•	 Mid-Atlantic: average of $96,000
•	 South: average of $83,000
•	 Midwest: average of $80,000
Next let’s drill down into the differences between respon­
dents. The data might affect your career choices.

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
We asked respondents to rate their bargaining skills on a 1- to 
5-point scale; 5 meaning they are a very good bargainer. 
(While this rating is very subjective, the subjectivity is appro­
priate for this question because so much about bargaining 
has to do with confidence and being able to assess yourself 
highly.) For every self-assessed bargaining point, the respon­
dent’s salary estimate goes up by $5,695. So holding every­
thing else constant, someone who gave themselves 5 points 
will make 4 x $5,695 = $22,780 more than someone with 
1 point.
Gender had a predictable influence on salary in the web field. 
Our analysis showed that everything else being equal, men 
earned an average of $2,165 more than women.
WE FOUND THAT EACH YEAR of experience is worth about 
$1,350. That is, if you have five years of experience, you’re 
likely to earn $1,350 more than someone who is similar to you 
but has only four years of experience.
Education makes a big difference in salary—something that 
may be surprising, given that the web contains a lot of people 
who are self-taught or who got brief educational experiences 
at for-profit programs. If you have a doctorate, you can expect 
to earn on average $10,434 more than someone without one. 
Strangely enough, possessing a master’s degree is slightly bad 
for salary: respondents with master’s degrees earned $542 
less, all else being equal.
Although older respondents tended to earn more, this was 
attributable to years of experience. When experience is held 
constant, respondents in the 26 to 30 and 31 to 35 groups 
earned the most, with an advantage of $3,932 and $3,347, 
respectively, over other age groups. Respondents aged 61 
to 65 earned $4,526 less than younger respondents with 
similar experience.

company size. But when we factor in all the other differences 
between employees, it looks like the best salaries are given 
out in firms of 1,001 to 2,500 employees, and the next best 
size is 101 to 500.
•	 1 (4% of respondents): average salary $57,000
•	 2 to 25 (22% of respondents): average salary $57,000
•	 26 to 100 (17% of respondents): average salary $78,000
•	 101 to 500 (18% of respondents): average salary $82,000
•	 501 to 1,000 (8% of respondents): average salary $87,000
•	 1,001 to 2,500 (8% of respondents): average salary $86,000
•	 2,501 to 10,000 (11% of respondents): average salary $88,000
•	 10,000 or more (12% of respondents): average salary $98,000
If the company is more than 20 years old, we saw a penalty 
of $2,197 for working there. Perhaps this is because people 
at such firms stay in one job longer, and don’t experience the 
salary boost that others get by moving to new firms.
THE BEST INDUSTRIES TO WORK FOR, in terms of salary, 
were search/social networking and banking/finance. If you are 
in search/social networking, you probably earn a whopping 
$15,193 more than someone with comparable experience 
and characteristics in other industries. In banking/finance, 
you can earn $7,043 more. There are a couple of other 
advantageous fields:
•	 Software (including SaaS, web, mobile): $2,142 better 
than average
•	 Publishing/media: $1,376 better than average
But you will be penalized for working in the 
following industries:
•	 Education: $8,608 worse than average
•	 Carriers/telecommunications: $1,547 worse than average
And think twice before becoming a consultant: they earn 
$8,448 less than average.
Company size had a major impact on salary, but not on a 
simple linear curve. It looks fairly simple, salary increasing with

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
And among these job descriptions, consultants again come 
out the big losers: $6,547 worse than average.
Hours Worked
On the web, workaholics rule. You get an enormous advan­
tage over other employees for working more than 60 hours a 
week. In general, the more hours you work, the better your 
salary, but the 60+ bonus of $14,199 stood out. (We did not 
calculate what people earn by the hour.)
Activities
Writing code for collaborative projects proved to be a good 
investment. Respondents who reported “minor involvement” 
in collaborative projects saw a bonus $3,485, while “major 
involvement” reaped a bonus of $5,093.
We tried to measure the effects of different tasks. Attending 
meetings is correlated with significant salary increases. 
This doesn’t mean you should arrange to attend arbitrary 
A MANAGER IN WEB DEVELOPMENT earns $11,689 
more than other respondents, and upper management earns 
$15,094 more. (We put a number of self-defined job catego­
ries into “upper management:” CEO, president, owner, head 
of engineering, VP, etc.) The next best career step is to ascend 
to the rank of an architect, where you can earn $9,760 more. 
Job titles and company sizes interact in our survey. In small 
firms, we get responses from a relatively large number of peo­
ple whose jobs are in “upper management,” but salaries in 
small companies are generally lower than those in large ones. 
Correspondingly, people whose job titles say “architect” tend 
to work for large firms, and benefit from that position.
Other bonuses and penalties added up as follows:
•	 Senior engineer/developer: $4,311 better than average
•	 Principal/lead: $1,896 better than average
•	 System administrator: $2,636 worse than average
•	 Engineer/developer/programmer: $3,243 worse 
than average

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
The tasks you do want to avoid are project management and 
content management systems. Major involvement in project 
management, oddly enough, brings with it a $3,476 decrease 
in salary, although minor involvement has no effect. Similarly, 
you are penalized $1,476 if you have major involvement in 
communicating with less technical or non-technical depart­
ments (but no penalty for minor involvement).
Minor involvement with CMSs costs you $4,647, and major 
involvement costs you only $3,824. We don’t know why 
major involvement should be better than minor involvement. 
The reason may be that CMSs are associated with less techni­
cally sophisticated jobs.
Designers get less money than average; they do not measure 
up to programmers in salary. Minor involvement in design 
work earns $1,244 less than average, and major involvement 
earns $1,094 less than average.
meetings. The statistics are probably associated with playing a 
role of team leader or manager. Interestingly, more meetings 
are not necessarily better—there’s a limit to the benefit. Here 
are the correlations:
•	 4 to 8 hours of meetings per week: $3,873 better
•	 9 to 20 hours of meetings per week: $6,961 better
•	 More than 20 hours of meetings per week: $2,309 better
Teaching or training others also has a positive effect. All other 
things being equal, you earn $2,300 more by being involved 
in teaching.
Performance is a good field to enter: you earn $1,434 more 
than average for minor involvement in performance and 
$2,258 more than average for major involvement.

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
−
−Knockout: 6%
−
−Ember: 4%
−
−Polymer: 3%
−
−Meteor: 2%
There was no such rush toward any PHP framework; 
nine different frameworks took less than 10% each of 
the respondents.
•	 SVG is the most popular graphics environment but is still 
relatively little used at 30%. D3 was even less popular, at 
19%.
•	 Selenium, at 25%, is the most popular testing tool, 
as might be expected. However, there were other 
strong contenders:
−
−Mocha: 20%
−
−Karma: 19%
−
−Protractor: 6%
−
−QUnit: 5%
−
−PHPUnit: 2%
THE RAW TALLIES OF RESPONDENTS’ ANSWERS fur­
nished a few interesting insights.
•	 MacOS is the most popular operating system, used by 
64% of respondents, but Linux is also surprisingly popular 
at 57%. (Respondents obviously use multiple computers, 
because the shares of operating systems add up to much 
more than 100%.)
•	 Sublime is a surprising favorite for text editors, chosen 
by 42% of the respondents (although once again, totals 
added up to more than 100%.
•	 Express runs away with the prize for most popular 
Node framework. It was chosen by 26% of all survey 
respondents, whereas hapi, Koa, and Sails each got just 
1% to 3%.
•	 Familiar JavaScript frameworks turned up as favorites, 
although Backbone came out further down the list:
−
−jQuery: 67%
−
−Angular: 37%
−
−React: 23%
−
−Backbone: 13%

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
are much more likely to use certain other tools as well. For 
instance, Windows programmers tend to use ASP.NET for 
their main framework, Visual Studio as their IDE, and SQL 
Server for their database. Although one would expect to see 
that cluster, we found nine other clusters that are much less 
predictable. We’ll look at each in this section, along with their 
positive or negative effects on salary.
There are two reasons you will find these clusters interesting:
•	 If you want to get a higher salary, you might be able to 
do so by learning a cluster that has a positive impact (or 
less of a negative impact) on salary.
•	 If you like where you are, you might broaden your skills by 
learning new tools or frameworks that are clustered with 
the ones you already know.
Many of the most popular tools and frameworks among 
our respondents turn up in none of the ten clusters. This is 
probably because they are so pervasive (jQuery, for instance) 
that they are used by a wide range of programmers across 
multiple clusters.
•	 MySQL remains the dominant database behind the 
web, at 52%. MariaDB, at 9%, has failed to make 
great inroads among MySQL fans, at least on the web. 
PostgreSQL and SQL Server come up next, both at 26%, 
and a plethora of diverse solutions follow:
−
−MongoDB: 25%
−
−Redis: 21%
−
−CouchDB: 5%
−
−Oracle: 5%
−
−Neo4j: 2%
•	 WordPress is the most popular CMS, although Drupal 
makes a respectable showing:
−
−WordPress: 29%
−
−Drupal: 12%
−
−Joomla!: 4%
−
−Magento: 4%
−
−Django-cms: 2%
−
−Umbraco: 1%
In general, working with libraries or frameworks led to a sal­
ary $1,248 more than average.
Because there are so many tools, libraries, and frameworks, 
we applied some basic machine learning to find clusters of 
related tools. The principle is that people who use one tool

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
Ruby/PostgreSQL Cluster
This cluster includes many well-known tools, but none of 
them are among the most popular in the survey. However, 
they tend to be used together, and knowing each one adds 
an average of $1,442 to salaries (up to a maximum of seven 
tools):
•	 Capistrano continuous integrator
•	 Chef configuration manager
•	 Haml templating framework
•	 JSONView display tool
•	 Jekyll continuous integrator
•	 PostgreSQL database
•	 Redis caching server
•	 Ruby language
•	 Travis CI continuous integrator
It would make sense for Ruby programmers to rely on 
Capistrano, which was designed for Ruby. Haml is also 
Express Cluster
The first cluster surrounds the popular Express framework. 
It is the most lucrative cluster we found because each tool 
in it adds an average of $2,068 to salaries. (We found this 
to be true up to a maximum of eight tools in this cluster—if 
you keep adding tools, your salary tops out after eight). The 
cluster includes:
•	 Charles debugger
•	 Express framework
•	 Jade 
templating framework
•	 Mocha test framework
•	 MongoDB data 
storage engine
•	 PostMan 
Chrome extension
•	 React framework
•	 Swagger web framework
•	 Webpack module bundler
It is hard to see a rationale for using these particular tools 
together. React is a fairly popular framework in its own 
right, but other tools, such as Jade, are used by relatively few 
programmers. In any case, our statistics suggest they make a 
good combo.

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
GitHub Cluster
In contrast to the previous cluster, which tended to use 
GitLab, the far more popular GitHub has its own cluster. 
npm, another tool in this cluster, was the most popular in its 
category, used by 51% of respondents. But the cluster has no 
effect on average salary.
•	 Atom text editor
•	 Backbone 
JavaScript framework
•	 Bitbucket version control
•	 Bower package manager
•	 Browserify 
package manager
•	 Grunt task manager
•	 Gulp task manager
•	 Handlebars 
templating framework
•	 npm package manager
•	 RequireJS 
package manager
The connections among these tools make sense. Most are tied 
in with Node.js, and many depend on npm.
Ruby-oriented, with a Ruby on Rails plug-in. Most of the other 
tools are language agnostic and don’t have obvious intercon­
nections. And as already mentioned, none are among the 
most popular tools among our respondents.
Free Software Cluster
The tools in this cluster are mostly familiar and are generally 
used together. Our respondents chose Vim (29%) much less 
than Sublime (42%) but more than Emacs (5%). The Perl 
language is used by only 5% of respondents but turned up 
in this cluster along with Python (22%). This cluster has no 
effect on average salary.
•	 Bash shell command line
•	 cURL downloader
•	 GitLab source 
code repository
•	 Linux operating system
•	 Perl language
•	 Python language
•	 Unix operating system
•	 Vim text editor

the computing infrastructure, although most web developers 
have abandoned them for slicker and newer languages (and 
39% of respondents use PHP as well). Oracle is also going 
strong. Still, among our respondents, Jenkins CI is the only 
tool in the following cluster that appears at the top of their 
choices (31%).
This cluster has no effect on average salary.
•	 C/C++ language
•	 Eclipse integrated development environment
•	 JMeter performance tool
•	 Java language
•	 Jenkins CI continuous integrator
•	 JetBrains IDE integrated development environment
•	 Oracle database
•	 SoapUI functional test tool
•	 Subversion version control system
Graphics Cluster
The relationship among these tools is obvious. They are used 
for designing, creating, and testing user interfaces. This cluster 
has no effect on average salary.
•	 Canvas graphics engine
•	 D3 graphics library
•	 Sketch user interface 
design tool
•	 SVG graphics engine
•	 WebGL graphics API
•	 WebPagetest 
performance tool
Established Tool Cluster
We have tried to choose a neutral name for this cluster, but 
to many readers, it may smack of “legacy” tools. One can 
well wonder where Subversion users have been hiding during 
the past decade’s move to distributed version control, but 
Subversion still holds the allegiance of 20% of our respon­
dents (more than GitLab at 14%, or Mercurial at a mere 3%). 
There is no doubt that C++ and Java remain critical parts of

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
Code Development Cluster
The tools and websites in this cluster help JavaScript develop­
ers learn, share, and develop code in various ways. Some of 
the tools may be more popular among newer programmers, 
although they have broad value. This cluster has no effect on 
average salary.
•	 Brackets text editor
•	 CodePen code repository
•	 Gist code sharing tool
•	 JSBin code repository
•	 JSFiddle text editor
•	 Sublime text editor
Test Cluster
Several tools and frameworks for testing appear in this cluster, 
some of them very popular and some of them used by only a 
few people. Other tools appear here too, for unclear reasons. 
This cluster has no effect on average salary.
•	 Angular JavaScript framework
•	 Jasmine test framework
•	 Karma test runner
•	 LESS database modeling tool
•	 Protractor test framework
•	 Selenium test framework
•	 WebStorm integrated development environment

2016–2017 WEB SALARY SURVEY
LAMP Cluster
Most of the tools in this cluster are part of the classic web 
stack of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Composer is a 
PHP package manager. We don’t know why Photoshop and 
WordPress turn up here. In any case, these tools impose a 
penalty, despite their popularity: each one (up to a maximum 
of seven) decreases average salary by $2,257.
•	 Adobe Photoshop graphic 
manipulation program
•	 CodeIgniter 
PHP framework
•	 Composer 
package manager
•	 Drupal content 
management system
•	 Laravel PHP framework
•	 MariaDB database
•	 MySQL database
•	 PHP language
•	 Symfony PHP framework
•	 WordPress content 
management system
•	 Zend Framework 
PHP framework
Windows Cluster
Most of the tools in this cluster work only in a Windows envi­
ronment. None are popular across our respondents overall, 
but they clearly form an important subculture. However, using 
each tool in this cluster is shown by our analysis to reduce 
average salary by $1,129.
•	 ASP/ASP.NET framework
•	 Fiddler debugger
•	 Knockout JavaScript framework
•	 Notepad++ editor
•	 SQL Server database
•	 Visual Studio Code text editor
•	 Visual Studio integrated development environment
•	 Windows operating system

OUR 2,000 RESPONDENTS collectively give us a fascinating 
view into what developers are using on the web and how 
they are remunerated. We have used robust statistical tech­
niques to ensure that our results are significant, but as we said 
near the beginning, you should be careful drawing real-life 
conclusions from them.
One overall positive lesson to take from this report is that 
salaries tend overall to increase. If you just stay in this field, 
you are likely to prosper. Certain steps, such as moving into 
management or learning new tools, may help you even more.
