PREFACE
In the Third Edition of College Mathematics, I have maintained the point-of-view of
the ﬁrst two editions. Students who are engaged in learning mathematics in the
mathematical range from algebra to calculus will ﬁnd virtually all major topics from
those curricula in this text. However, a substantial number of important changes have
been made in this edition. First, there is more of an emphasis now on topics in discrete
mathematics. Second, the graphing calculator is introduced as an important problem-
solving tool. Third, material related to manual and tabular computations of logarithms
has been removed, and replaced with material that is calculator-based. Fourth, all
material related to the concepts of locus has been modernized. Fifth, tables and graphs
have been changed to reﬂect current curriculum and teaching methods. Sixth, all
material related to the conic sections has been substantially changed and modernized.
Additionally, much of the rest of the material in the third edition has been changed
to reﬂect current classroom methods and pedagogy, and mathematical modeling is
introduced as a problem-solving tool. Notation has been changed as well when
necessary.
My thanks must be expressed to Barbara Gilson and Andrew Littell of
McGraw-Hill. They have been supportive of this project from its earliest stages. I
also must thank Dr. Marti Garlett, Dean of the Teachers College at Western Governors
University, for her professional support as I struggled to meet deadlines while
beginning a new position at the University. I thank Maureen Walker for her handling
of the manuscript and proofs. And ﬁnally, I thank my wife, Dr. Jan Zlotnik Schmidt,
for putting up with my frequent need to work at home on this project. Without her
support, this edition would not have been easily completed.

Chapter 1
Elements of Algebra
IN ARITHMETIC the numbers used are always known numbers; a typical problem is to con-
vert 5 hours and 35 minutes to minutes. This is done by multiplying 5 by 60 and adding 35; thus,
5 · 60 þ 35 ¼ 335 minutes.
In algebra some of the numbers used may be known but others are either unknown or not speciﬁed;
that is, they are represented by letters. For example, convert h hours and m minutes into minutes. This is
done in precisely the same manner as in the paragraph above by multiplying h by 60 and adding m; thus,
h · 60 þ m ¼ 60h þ m. We call 60h þ m an algebraic expression. (See Problem 1.1.)
Since algebraic expressions are numbers, they may be added, subtracted, and so on, following the
same laws that govern these operations on known numbers. For example, the sum of 5 · 60 þ 35 and
2 · 60 þ 35 is ð5 þ 2Þ · 60 þ 2 · 35; similarly, the sum of h · 60 þ m and k · 60 þ m is ðh þ kÞ · 60 þ 2m. (See
Problems 1.2–1.6.)
POSITIVE INTEGRAL EXPONENTS.
If a is any number and n is any positive integer, the product
of the n factors a · a · a · · · a is denoted by an. To distinguish between the letters, a is called the base and n
is called the exponent.
If a and b are any bases and m and n are any positive integers, we have the following laws of
exponents:
(1)
am · an ¼ amþn
(2)
ðamÞn ¼ amn
(3)
am
an ¼ amn;
a 6¼ 0;
m > n;
am
an ¼

anm ;
a 6¼ 0;
m < n
(4)
a · b
ð
Þn¼ anbn
(5)
a
b
 n
¼ an
bn ;
b 6¼ 0
(See Problem 1.7.)
LET n BE A POSITIVE INTEGER and a and b be two numbers such that bn ¼ a; then b is called an nth
root of a. Every number a 6¼ 0 has exactly n distinct nth roots.
If a is imaginary, all of its nth roots are imaginary; this case will be excluded here and treated later.
(See Chapter 35.)

If a is real and n is odd, then exactly one of the nth roots of a is real. For example, 2 is the real cube
root of 8, 23 ¼ 8

, and 3 is the real ﬁfth root of 243½ 3
ð
Þ5¼ 243.
If a is real and n is even, then there are exactly two real nth roots of a when a > 0, but no real nth
roots of a when a < 0. For example, þ3 and 3 are the square roots of 9; þ2 and 2 are the real sixth
roots of 64.
THE PRINCIPAL nth ROOT OF a is the positive real nth root of a when a is positive and the real nth
root of a, if any, when a is negative. The principal nth root of a is denoted by
ﬃﬃa
np , called a radical. The
integer n is called the index of the radical and a is called the radicand. For example,
ﬃﬃ
9
p
¼ 3
ﬃﬃﬃ
64
6p
¼ 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
243
5p
¼ 3
(See Problem 1.8.)
ZERO, FRACTIONAL, AND NEGATIVE EXPONENTS.
When s is a positive integer, r is any
integer, and p is any rational number, the following extend the deﬁnition of an in such a way that the
laws (1)-(5) are satisﬁed when n is any rational number.

the exponent is irrational. We shall also assume that these numbers have been deﬁned in such a way that
the laws (1)–(5) are satisﬁed.] (See Problem 1.9–1.10.)

Chapter 2
Functions
A VARIABLE IS A SYMBOL selected to represent any one of a given set of numbers, here assumed
to be real numbers. Should the set consist of just one number, the symbol representing it is called a
constant.
The range of a variable consists of the totality of numbers of the set which it represents. For
example, if x is a day in September, the range of x is the set of positive integers 1; 2; 3; . . . ; 30; if x (ft) is
the length of rope cut from a piece 50 ft long, the range of x is the set of numbers greater than 0 and less
than 50.
Examples of ranges of a real variable, together with special notations and graphical representations,
are given in Problem 2.1
FUNCTION.
A correspondence (x; y) between two sets of numbers which pairs to an arbitrary number
x of the ﬁrst set exactly one number y of the second set is called a function. In this case, it is customary to
speak of y as a
function of x. The variable x is called the independent variable and y is called the
dependent variable.
A function may be deﬁned
(a)
By a table of correspondents or table of values, as in Table 2.1.

(b)
By an equation or formula, as y ¼ x þ 2.
For each value assigned to x, the above relation yields a corresponding value for y. Note that the table
above is a table of values for this function.
A FUNCTION IS CALLED single-valued if, to each value of y in its range, there corresponds just one
value of x; otherwise, the function is called multivalued. For example, y ¼ x þ 3 deﬁnes y as a single-
valued function of x while y ¼ x2 deﬁnes y as a multivalued (here, two-valued) function of x.
At times it will be more convenient to label a given function of x as fðxÞ, to be read ‘‘the f function of
x’’ or simply ‘‘f of x.’’ (Note carefully that this is not to be confused with ‘‘f times x.’’) If there are two

functions, one may be labeled fðxÞ and the other gðxÞ. Also, if y ¼ fðxÞ ¼ x2  5x þ 4, the statement ‘‘the
value of the function is 2 when x ¼ 3’’ can be replaced by ‘‘fð3Þ ¼ 2.’’ (See Problem 2.2.)
Let y ¼ fðxÞ. The set of values of the independent variable x is called the domain of the function
while the set of values of the dependent variable is called the range of the function. For example, y ¼ x2
deﬁnes a function whose domain consists of all (real) numbers and whose range is all nonnegative
numbers, that is, zero and the positive numbers; fðxÞ ¼ 3=ðx  2Þ deﬁnes a function whose domain
consists of all numbers except 2 (why?) and whose range is all numbers except 0. (See Problems 2.3–2.8.)
A VARIABLE w (dependent) is said to be a function of the (independent) variables x; y; z; . . . if when a
value of each of the variables x; y; z; . . . is known, there corresponds exactly one value of w. For example,
the volume V of a rectangular parallelepiped of dimensions x; y; z is given by V ¼ xyz. Here V is a
function of three independent variables. (See Problems 2.9–2.10.)
ADDITIONAL TERMINOLOGY If the function y ¼ fðxÞ is such that for every y in the range
there is one and only one x in the domain such that y ¼ fðxÞ, we say that f is a one-to-one
correspondence. Functions that are one-to-one correspondences are sometimes called bijections. Note
that all functions of the form ax þ by þ c ¼ 0 are bijections. Note that y ¼ x2 is not a bijection. Is y ¼ x3
a bijection? (Answer: Yes!)

An open box is to be formed from a rectangular sheet of tin 20 · 32 in. by cutting equal squares, x in. on a

From Fig. 2-1. it is seen that the base of the box has dimensions ð20  2xÞ by ð32  2xÞ in. and the height
is x in. Then

folding along the dotted lines shown in Fig. 2-2. Express the volume of the box as a function of x.
One dimension of the base of the box is ð20  2xÞ cm; let y cm be the other. Then 2x þ 2y ¼ 32 and
y ¼ 16  x. Thus,

A FUNCTION y ¼ fðxÞ, by deﬁnition, yields a collection of pairs (x, f(x)) or (x, y) in which x is any
element in the domain of the function and f(x) or y is the corresponding value of the function. These
pairs are called ordered pairs.
EXAMPLE 1.
Obtain 10 ordered pairs for the function y ¼ 3x  2.
The domain of deﬁnition of the function is the set of real numbers. We may choose at random any
10 real numbers as values of x. For one such choice, we obtain the chart in Table 3.1.

(See Problem 3.1.)
THE RECTANGULAR CARTESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEM in a plane is a device by which there
is established a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the plane and ordered pairs of real
numbers (a, b).
Consider two real number scales intersecting at right angles in O, the origin of each (see Fig. 3-1),
and having the positive direction on the horizontal scale (now called the x axis) directed to the right and
the positive direction on the vertical scale (now called the y axis) directed upward.
Let P be any point distinct from O in the plane of the two axes and join P to O by a straight line. Let
the projection of OP on the x axis be OM ¼ a and the projection of OP on the y axis be ON ¼ b. Then
the pair of numbers (a, b) in that order are called the plane rectangular Cartesian coordinates (brieﬂy, the
rectangular coordinates) of P. In particular, the coordinates of O, the origin of the coordinate system, are
(0, 0).
The ﬁrst coordinate, giving the directed distance of P from the y axis, is called the abscissa of P,
while the second coordinate, giving the directed distance of P from the x axis, is called the ordinate of P.
Note carefully that the points (3, 4) and (4, 3) are distinct points.
The axes divide the plane into four sections, called
quadrants. Figure 4-1 shows the customary
numbering of the quadrants and the respective signs of the coordinates of a point in each quadrant. (See
Problems 3.1–3.4.)

THE GRAPH OF A FUNCTION y ¼ fðxÞ consists of the totality of points ðx; yÞ whose coordinates
satisfy the relation y ¼ fðxÞ.
EXAMPLE 2.
Graph the function 3x  2.
After plotting the points whose coordinates (x, y) are given in Table 3.1, it appears that they lie on a
straight line. See Fig. 3.2. Figure 3-2 is not the complete graph since (1000, 2998) is one of its points and
is not shown. Moreover, although we have joined the points by a straight line, we have not proved that
every point on the line has as coordinates a number pair given by the function. These matters as well as
such questions as: What values of x should be chosen? How many values of x are needed? will become
clearer as we proceed with the study of functions. At present,
(1)
Build a table of values.
(2)
Plot the corresponding points.
(3)
Pass a smooth curve through these points, moving from left to right.
It is helpful to picture the curve in your mind before attempting to trace it on paper. If there is doubt
about the curve between two plotted points, determine other points in the interval.

GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS

ANY VALUE OF x for which the corresponding value of function fðxÞ is zero is called a zero of the
function. Such values of x are also called roots of the equation fðxÞ ¼ 0. The real roots of an equation
fðxÞ ¼ 0 may be approximated by estimating from the graph of fðxÞ the abscissas of its points of
intersection with the x axis. (See Problems 3.9–3.11.)
Algebraic methods for ﬁnding the roots of equations will be treated in later chapters. The graphing
calculator can also be used to ﬁnd roots by graphing the function and observing where the graph
intersects the x axis. See Appendix A.

See Fig. 3-5. The equation of this graph, called a parabola, is y ¼ x2. Note for x 6¼ 0, x2 > 0. Thus, the
curve is never below the x axis. Moreover, as jxj increase, x2 increases; that is, as we move from the origin
along the x axis in either direction, the curve moves farther and farther from the axis. Hence, in sketching
parabolas sufﬁcient points must be plotted so that their U shape can be seen.

Linear Equations
AN EQUATION is a statement, such as ðaÞ 2x  6 ¼ 4  3x, ðbÞ y2 þ 3y ¼ 4, and ðcÞ 2x þ 3y ¼ 4xy þ 1;
that two expressions are equal. An equation is linear in an unknown if the highest degree of that
unknown in the equation is 1. An equation is quadratic in an unknown if the highest degree of that
unknown is 2. The ﬁrst is a linear equation in one unknown, the second is a quadratic in one unknown,
and the third is linear in each of the two unknowns but is of degree 2 in the two unknowns.
Any set of values of the unknowns for which the two members of an equation are equal is called a
solution of the equation. Thus, x ¼ 2 is a solution of (a), since 2ð2Þ  6 ¼ 4  3ð2Þ; y ¼ 1 and y ¼ 4 are
solutions of (b); and x ¼ 1; y ¼ 1 is a solution of (c). A solution of an equation in one unknown is also
called a root of the equation.
TO SOLVE A LINEAR EQUATION in one unknown, perform the same operations on both members
of the equation in order to obtain the unknown alone in the left member.

(See Problems 4.1–4.3.)
An equation which contains fractions having the unknown in one or more denominators may
sometimes reduce to a linear equation when cleared of fractions. When the resulting equation is solved,
the solution must be checked since it may or may not be a root of the original equation. (See Problems
4.4–4.8.)
RATIO AND PROPORTION.
The ratio of two quantities is their quotient. The ratio of 1 inch to 1
foot is 1/12 or 1:12, a pure number; the ratio of 30 miles to 45 minutes is 30=45 ¼ 2=3 mile per minute.
The expressed equality of two ratios, as a
b ¼ c
d , is called a proportion. (See Problems 4.11–4.12.)

VARIATION.
A variable y is said to vary directly as another variable x (or y is proportional to x) if y
is equal to some constant c times x, that is, if y ¼ cx.
A variable y is said to vary inversely as another variable x if y varies directly as the reciprocal of x,
that is, if y ¼ c=x.

TWO LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO UNKNOWNS.
Let the system of equations be
 a1x þ b1y þ c1 ¼ 0
a2x þ b2y þ c2 ¼ 0
Each equation has an unlimited number of solutions (x, y) corresponding to the unlimited number
of points on the locus (straight line) which it represents. Our problem is to ﬁnd all solutions common to
the two equations or the coordinates of all points common to the two lines. There are three cases:
(1)
The system has one and only one solution; that is, the two lines have one and only one point
in common. The equations are said to be consistent (have common solutions) and independent.
See Fig. 5-1, indicating two distinct intersecting lines.
(2)
The system has an unlimited number of solutions; that is, the two equations are equivalent
or the two lines are coincident. The equations are said to be consistent and dependent. See
Fig. 5-2, indicating that the two equations represent the same line.
(3)
The system has no solution; that is, the two lines are parallel and distinct. The equations are
said to be inconsistent. See Fig. 5-3, indicating that the two equations result in two parallel
lines.

GRAPHICAL SOLUTION.
We plot the graphs of the two equations on the same axes and scale off
the coordinates of the point of intersection. The defect of this method is that, in general, only
approximate solutions are obtained. (See Problem 5.1.)
ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION.
A system of two consistent and independent equations in two unknowns
may be solved algebraically by eliminating one of the unknowns.

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS USING DETACHED COEFFICIENTS.
In Example 4
below, a variation of the method of addition and subtraction is used to solve a system of linear
equations. On the left the equations themselves are used, while on the right the same moves are made
on the rectangular array (called a matrix) of the coefﬁcients and constant terms. The numbering (1),
(2), (3), . . . refers both to the equations and to the rows of the matrices.

There are, in essence, three moves:
(a)
Multiply the elements of a row by a nonzero number. This move is used only to obtain an element 1 in
a prescribed position.
(b)
Multiply the elements of a row by a nonzero number and add to the corresponding elements of another
row. This move is used to obtain an element 0 in a prescribed position.

THE GRAPH OF THE QUADRATIC FUNCTION y ¼ ax2 þ bx þ c; a 6¼ 0, is a parabola. If a > 0, the
parabola opens upward (Fig. 6-1); if a 5 0, the parabola opens downward (Fig. 6-2). The lowest point
of the parabola of Fig. 6-1 and the highest point of the parabola of Fig. 6-2 are called vertices. The abscissa
of the vertex is given by x ¼ b=2a. (See Problem 6.1.). See Chapter 36 for a full discussion of parabolas.

Frequently a quadratic equation may be solved by factoring. (See Problem 6.2.)
Every quadratic equation (6.1) can be solved by the following process, known as completing the
square:
(a)
Substract the constant term c from both members.
(b)
Divide both member by a, the coefﬁcient of x2.
33
Copyright 1958 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click Here for Terms of Use.

(c)
Add to each member the square of one-half the coefﬁcient of the term in x.
(d )
Set the square root of the left member (a perfect square) equal to 6 the square root of the
right member and solve for x.

EQUATIONS IN QUADRATIC FORM.
An equation is in quadratic form if it is quadratic in some
function of the unknown. For example, if the unknown is z, the equation might be quadratic in z2 or
in z3.
EXAMPLE 2.
Solve x4 þ x2  12 ¼ 0. This is a quadratic in x2.

EQUATIONS INVOLVING RADICALS may sometimes reduce to quadratic equations after squaring
to remove the radicals. All solutions of this quadratic equation must be tested since some may be
extraneous. (See Problems 6.13–6.16.)
THE DISCRIMINANT of the quadratic equation (6.1) is, by deﬁnition, the quantity b2  4ac. When
a; b; c are rational numbers, the roots of the equation are
Real and unequal if and only if b2  4ac > 0.
Real and equal if and only if b2  4ac ¼ 0.
Complex if and only if b2  4ac 5 0. (See Chapter 39.)
(See Problems 6.17–6.18.)
SUM AND PRODUCT OF THE ROOTS.
If x1 and x2 are the roots of the quadratic equation (6.1),
then x1 þ x2 ¼ b=a and x1 · x2 ¼ c=a.
A quadratic equation whose roots are x1 and x2 may be written in the form
x2  ðx1 þ x2Þx þ x1 · x2 ¼ 0

Inequalities
AN INEQUALITY is a statement that one (real) number is greater than or less than another; for
example, 3 > 2; 10 < 5.
Two inequalities are said to have the same sense if their signs of inequality point in the same
direction. Thus, 3 > 2 and 5 > 10 have the same sense; 3 > 2 and 10 < 5 have opposite senses.
The sense of an equality is not changed:
(a)
If the same number is added to or subtracted from both sides
(b)
If both sides are multiplied or divided by the same positive number
The sense of an equality is changed if both sides are multiplied or divided by the same negative
number. (See Problems 7.1–7.3.)
AN ABSOLUTE INEQUALITY is one which is true for all real values of the letters involved; for
example, x2 þ 1 > 0 is an absolute inequality.
A CONDITIONAL INEQUALITY is one which is true for certain values of the letters involved; for
example, x þ 2 > 5 is a conditional inequality, since it is true for x ¼ 4 but not for x ¼ 1.
SOLUTION OF CONDITIONAL INEQUALITIES.
The solution of a conditional inequality in one
letter, say x, consists of all values of x for which the inequality is true. These values lie on one or more
intervals of the real number scale as illustrated in the examples below.
To solve a linear inequality, proceed as in solving a linear equality, keeping in mind the rules for
keeping or reversing the sense.

The Locus of
an Equation
WHAT IS A LOCUS?
Locus, in Latin, means location. The plural of locus is loci. A locus of points is
the set of points, and only those points, that satisfy conditions.
For example, the locus of points that are 2 m from a given point P is the set of points 2 m from P.
These points lie on the circle with P as center and radius 2 m.
To determine a locus:
(1)
State what is given and the condition to be satisﬁed.
(2)
Find several points satisfying the condition which indicate the shape of the locus.
(3)
Connect the points and describe the locus fully. For example, the locus xðy  xÞ ¼ 0 consists of
the lines x ¼ 0 and y  x ¼ 0. The reader can easily sketch several points and the locus.
DEGENERATE LOCI.
The locus of an equation fðx; yÞ ¼ 0 is called degenerate if fðx; yÞ is the
product of two or more real factors gðx; yÞ; hðx; yÞ; . . . : The locus of fðx; yÞ ¼ 0 then consists of the loci
of gðx; yÞ ¼ 0, hðx; yÞ ¼ 0; . . . : (See Problem 8.1.)
INTERCEPTS.
The intercepts on the coordinate axes of a locus are the directed distances from the
origin to the points of intersection of the locus and the coordinate axes.
To ﬁnd the x intercepts, set y ¼ 0 in the equation of the locus and solve for x; to ﬁnd the y intercepts,
set x ¼ 0 and solve for y. (See Problem 8.2.)
SYMMETRY.
Two points P and Q are said to be symmetric with respect to a point R if R is the
midpoint of the segment PQ (see Fig. 8-1). Each of the points is called the symmetric point of the other
with respect to the point R, the center of symmetry:
Two points P and Q are said to be symmetric with respect to a line l if l is the perpendicular bisector
of the segment PQ (see Fig. 8-2). Each of the points P; Q is called the symmetric point of the other with
respect to l, the axis of symmetry.
A locus is said to be symmetric with respect to a point R or to a line l if the symmetric point with
respect to R or l of every point of the locus is also a point of the locus (see Figs. 8-3 and 8-4). Also see
Chapter 22 for more on symmetry.

SYMMETRY OF A LOCUS.
The locus of a given equation fðx; yÞ ¼ 0 is symmetric with respect to
the x axis if an equivalent equation is obtained when y is replaced by y, is symmetric with respect to
the y axis if an equivalent equation is obtained when x is replaced by x, and is symmetric with respect
to the origin if an equivalent equation is obtained when x is replaced by x and y is replaced by
y simultaneously.
An equation whose graph is symmetric with respect to the y axis is called even; one whose graph is
symmetric with respect to the x axis is odd. See Chapter 22 for more on symmetry.
EXAMPLE 1.
Examine x2 þ 2y2 þ x ¼ 0 for symmetry with respect to the coordinate axes and the origin.
When y is replaced by y, we have x2 þ 2y2 þ x ¼ 0; the locus is symmetric with respect to the x axis.
When x is replaced by x, we have x2 þ 2y2  x ¼ 0; the locus is not symmetric with respect to the y axis.
When x is replaced by x and y by y, we have x2 þ 2y2  x ¼ 0; the locus is not symmetric with respect to the
origin. (See Problem 8.3.)
ASYMPTOTES.
The line x ¼ a is a vertical asymptote to the graph of an equation (locus) if, as x gets
arbitrarily close to a, the locus gets arbitrarily large.
The line y ¼ b is a horizontal asymptote to a locus if the locus gets arbitrarily close to b as x gets
arbitrarily large. See Fig. 8-5. (In calculus terms, if lim
x!1 fðxÞ ¼ a, then y ¼ a is a horizontal asymptote to
fðxÞ. If lim
x!b fðxÞ ¼ 1, then x ¼ b is a vertical asymptote.
Fig. 8-5
EXAMPLE 2.
Show that the line y  2 ¼ 0 is a horizontal asymptote of the curve xy  2x  1 ¼ 0.
The locus exists for all x 6¼ 0 and for all y 6¼ 2. Since y > 0 for x > 0, there is a branch of the locus in the ﬁrst
quadrant. On this branch choose a point, say, Að1; 3Þ, and let a point Pðx; yÞ, moving to the right from A, trace the
locus.

THE LOCUS OF AN EQUATION

From Table 8.1, which lists a few of the positions assumed by P, it is clear that as P moves to the right, (a) its
ordinate y remains greater than 2 and (b) the difference y  2 may be made as small as we please by taking x
sufﬁciently large. For example, if we wish y  2 5 1=1012, we take x 4 1012; if we wish y  2 5 1=10999, we take
x 4 10999, and so on. The line y  2 ¼ 0 is therefore a horizontal asymptote.

To ﬁnd the horizontal asymptotes: Solve the equation of the locus for x and set each real linear factor of the
denominator, if any, equal to zero.
To ﬁnd the vertical asymptotes: Solve the equation of the locus for y and set each real linear factor of the
denominator, if any, equal to zero.
EXAMPLE 3.
The locus of x2 þ 4y2 ¼ 4 has neither horizontal nor vertical asymptotes. The locus of x ¼ ð y þ 6Þ=

xy  y  x  2 ¼ 0:
Intercepts:
The x intercept is 2; the y intercept is 2.
Symmetry:
There is no symmetry with respect to the coordinate axes or the origin.
Asymptotes:
x ¼ 1; y ¼ 1:
To sketch the locus, ﬁrst draw in the asymptotes x ¼ 1 and y ¼ 1 (dotted lines). While the asymptotes
are not a part of the locus, they serve as very convenient guide lines. Since the locus does not exist for x ¼ 1
and y ¼ 1, it does not cross the asymptotes. Since there is one value of y for each value of x 6¼ 1, that is, since
y is single-valued, the locus appears in only two of the four regions into which the plane is separated by the
asymptotes.
From Table 8.2 it is evident that the locus lies in the region to the right of the vertical asymptote and
above the horizontal asymptote (see the portion of the table to the right of the double line) and in the region
to the left of the vertical asymptote and below the horizontal asymptote (see the portion of the table to the
left of the double line). The locus is shown in Fig. 8-11; note that it is symmetric with respect to (1, 1), the
point of intersection of the asymptotes.

The asymptotes divide the plane into six regions. Since the locus does not exist when x ¼ 62 and when
y ¼ 1 (that is, does not cross an asymptote) and since y is single-valued, the locus appears in only three of
these regions. By means of Table 8.3 the locus is sketched in Fig. 8-12. Note that only half of the table is

THE GENERAL EQUATION of the straight line is Ax þ By þ C ¼ 0, where A; B; C are arbitrary
constants except that not both A and B are zero.
If C ¼ 0, the line passes through the origin. If B ¼ 0, the line is vertical; if A ¼ 0, the line is
horizontal. Otherwise, the line has slope m ¼ A=B and y intercept b ¼ C=B:
If two nonvertical lines are parallel, their slopes are equal. Thus, the lines Ax þ By þ C ¼ 0 and
Ax þ By þ D ¼ 0 are parallel.
If two lines are perpendicular, the slope of one is the negative reciprocal of the slope of
the other. If m1 and m2 are the slopes of two perpendicular lines, the m1 ¼ 1=m2 or m1m2 ¼ 1.
Thus, Ax þ By þ C ¼ 0 and Bx  Ay þ D ¼ 0, where AB 6¼ 0, are perpendicular lines. (See Problems
9.5 – 9.8.)

Families of Straight
Lines
THE EQUATION y ¼ 3x þ b represents the set of all lines having slope 3. The quantity b is a variable
over the set of lines, each value of b being associated with one and only one line of the set. To distinguish
it from the variables x; y, which vary over the points of each line, b is called a parameter. Such sets of
lines are also called one-parameter systems or families of lines. See Fig. 10-1. (See Chapter 45 for a fuller
discussion of parametric equations.)
Similarly, the equation y ¼ mx þ 5, in which m is the parameter, represents the one-parameter
family of lines having y intercept ¼ 5 or passing through the point (0, 5). See Fig. 10-2. It is important to
note that one line satisfying the geometric condition is not included since for no value of m does the
equation y ¼ mx þ 5 yield the line x ¼ 0. (See Problems 10.1–10.4.)

Equation (10.1) provides a means of ﬁnding the equation of a line which passes through the point
of intersection of two given lines and satisﬁes one other condition, without having ﬁrst to compute the
coordinate of the point of intersection.
EXAMPLE 1.
Write the equation of the line which passes through the point of intersection of the lines
l1 :
3x þ 5y þ 29 ¼ 0
and
l2 :
7x  11y  13 ¼ 0
and through the point (2, 1).
Since the given point is not on l2, the required line is among those given by
l1 þ kl2:
3x þ 5y þ 29 þ kð7x  11y  13Þ ¼ 0
For the line which passes through ð2; 1Þ; 3ð2Þ þ 5ð1Þ þ 29 þ k½7ð2Þ  11ð1Þ  13 ¼ 0 and k ¼ 4; hence, its equation is

The Circle
A CIRCLE IS THE LOCUS of a point which moves in a plane so that it is always at a constant distance
from a ﬁxed point in the plane. The ﬁxed point is called the center and the constant distance is the length
of the radius of the circle. The circle is one of the ‘‘conic sections.’’ That is, the circle also results from
taking particular cross sections of the right-circular cone. See Chapter 36 for a discussion of three
additional conic sections: the parabola, the hyperbola, and the ellipse. As you think about slicing a cone
with a plane, what additional cross sections are generated?
THE STANDARD FORM of the equation of the circle whose center is at the point Cðh; kÞ and whose
radius is the constant r is
ðx  hÞ2 þ ð y  kÞ2 ¼ r2
ð11:1Þ
See Fig. 11-1. (See Problem 11.1.)
Fig. 11-1
THE GENERAL FORM of the equation of a circle is
x2 þ y2 þ 2Dx þ 2Ey þ F ¼ 0
ð11:2Þ
By completing the squares this may be put in the form
ðx þ DÞ2 þ ðx þ EÞ2 ¼ D2 þ E2  F
Thus, ð11:2Þ represents a circle with center at CðD; EÞ and radius
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
D2 þ E2  F
p
if ðD2 þ E2  FÞ > 0,
a point if ðD2 þ E2  FÞ ¼ 0, and an imaginary locus if ðD2 þ E2  FÞ ¼ 0. (See Problems 11.2–11.3.)
Copyright 1958 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click Here for Terms of Use.

IN BOTH THE STANDARD AND GENERAL FORM the equation of a circle contains three
independent arbitrary constants. It follows that a circle is uniquely determined by three independent
conditions. (See Problems 11.4–11.6.)
THE EQUATION OF A TANGENT to a circle may be found by making use of the fact that a tangent
and the radius drawn to the point of tangency are perpendicular. (See Problem 11.7.)
THE LENGTH OF A TANGENT to a circle from an external point P1 is deﬁned as the distance from
the point P1 to the point of tangency. The two tangents from an external point are of equal length. See
Fig. 11-2, where P1T > P1T 0.
Fig. 11-2
The square of the length of a tangent from the external point P1ðx1; y1Þ to a circle is obtained by
substituting the coordinates of the point in the left member of the equation of the circle when written in
the form ðx  hÞ2 þ ð y  kÞ2  r2 ¼ 0 or x2 þ y2 þ 2Dx þ 2Ey þ F ¼ 0. (See Problems 11.8–11.9.)
THE EQUATION
x2 þ y2 þ 2D1x þ 2E1y þ F1 þ kðx2 þ y2 þ 2D2x þ 2E2y þ F2Þ ¼ 0
ð11:3Þ
where
K1:
x2 þ y2 þ 2D1x þ 2E1y þ F1 ¼ 0
and
K2:
x2 þ y2 þ 2D2x þ 2E2y þ F2 ¼ 0
are distinct circles and k 6¼ 1 is a parameter, represents a one-parameter family of circles.
If K1 and K2 are concentric, the circles of (11.3) are concentric with them.
If K1 and K2 are not concentric, the circles of (11.3) have a common line of centers with them and the
centers of the circles of (11.3) divide the segment joining the centers of K1 and K2 in the ratio k : 1.
If K1 and K2 intersect in two distinct points P1 and P2, (11.3) consists of all circles except K2 which pass
through these points. If K1 and K2 are tangent to each other at the point P1, (11.3) consists of all circles
except K2 which are tangent to each other at P1. If K1 and K2 have no point in common, any two circles of
the family (11.3) have no point in common with each other. See Fig. 11-3. (See Problems 11.10–11.11.)

Using ðx  hÞ2 þ ð y  kÞ2 ¼ r2, the equation is ðx  4Þ2 þ ð y þ 2Þ2 ¼ 64:
(c)
Since the center is at Cð4; 2Þ, the equation has the form ðx þ 4Þ2 þ ð y þ 2Þ2 ¼ r2. The condition that

Hence
the

(d ) The tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency; hence r ¼ 6.

The center of the given circle is Cð1; 4Þ. Since the tangent at any point P on the circle is perpendicular

Arithmetic and

Progressions
A SEQUENCE IS A SET OF NUMBERS, called terms, arranged in a deﬁnite order; that is, there is a
rule by which the terms are formed. Sequences may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite. Only ﬁnite sequences will be
treated in this chapter.
EXAMPLE 1
(a)
Sequence:
3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27.
Type:
Finite of 7 terms.
Rule:
Add 4 to a given term to produce the next. The ﬁrst term is 3.
(b)
Sequence:
3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96.
Type:
Finite of 6 terms.
Rule:
Multiply a given term by 2 to produce the next. The ﬁrst term is 3.
AN ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION is a sequence in which each term after the ﬁrst is formed by
adding a ﬁxed amount, called the common difference, to the preceding term. The sequence of
Example 1(a) is an arithmetic progression whose common difference is 4. (See Problems 12.1–12.2.)
If a is the ﬁrst term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms of an arithmetic
progression, the successive terms are
a; a þ d; a þ 2d; a þ 3d; . . . ; a þ ðn  1Þd
ð12:1Þ
Thus, the last term (or nth term) l is given by
l ¼ a þ ðn  1Þd
ð12:2Þ
The sum S of the n terms of this progression is given by
S ¼ n
2 ða þ l Þ
or
S ¼ n
2 ½2a þ ðn  l Þd 
ð12:3Þ
(For a proof, see Problem 12.3.)

For this progression a ¼ 4; d ¼ 5, and n ¼ 20; then the twentieth term is l ¼ a þ ðn  1Þd ¼ 4 þ 19 · 5 ¼ 99 and
the sum of the ﬁrst 20 terms is
S ¼ n
2 ða þ l Þ ¼ 20
2 ð4 þ 99Þ ¼ 1030
(See Problems 12.4–12.8.)
THE TERMS BETWEEN THE FIRST AND LAST TERMS of an arithmetic progression are called
arithmetic means between these two terms. Thus, to insert k arithmetic means between two numbers is to
form an arithmetic progression of ðk þ 2Þ terms having the two given numbers as ﬁrst and last terms.
EXAMPLE 3.
Insert ﬁve arithmetic means between 4 and 22.
We have a ¼ 4; l ¼ 22, and n ¼ 5 þ 2 ¼ 7. Then 22 ¼ 4 þ 6d and d ¼ 3. The ﬁrst mean is 4 þ 3 ¼ 7, the
second is 7 þ 3 ¼ 10, and so on. The required means are 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and the resulting progression is 4, 7, 10, 13,
16, 19, 22.
THE ARITHMETIC MEAN.
When just one mean is to be inserted between two numbers to form an
arithmetic progression, it is called the arithmetic mean (also, the average) of the two numbers.
EXAMPLE 4.
Find the arithmetic mean of the two numbers a and l.
We seek the middle term of an arithmetic progression of three terms having a and l as the ﬁrst and third terms,
respectively. If d is the common difference, then a þ d ¼ l  d and d ¼ 1
2 ðl  aÞ. The arithmetic mean is
a þ d ¼ a þ 1
2 ðl  aÞ ¼ 1
2 ða þ l Þ. (See Problem 12.9.)
A GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION is a sequence in which each term after the ﬁrst is formed by
multiplying the preceding term by a ﬁxed number, called the common ratio. The sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96
of Example 1(b) is a geometric progression whose common ratio is 2. (See Problems 12.10–12.11.)
If a is the ﬁrst term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms, the geometric progression is
a; ar; ar2; . . . ; arn1
ð12:4Þ
Thus, the last (or nth) term l is given by
l ¼ arn1
ð12:5Þ
The sum S of the ﬁrst n terms of the geometric progression (12.4 ) is given by
S ¼ a  rl
1  r
or
S ¼ að1  rnÞ

(For a proof, see Problem 12.12.)

Determine which of the following sequences are arithmetic progressions (A.P.). In the case of an A.P., write
three more terms.

Since 6  3 ¼ 9  6 ¼ 12  9 ¼ 15  12 ¼ 18  15 ¼ 3, the sequence is an A.P. with common

Since 19  25 ¼ 13  19 ¼ 7  13 ¼ 1  7 ¼ 5  1 ¼ 6, the sequence is an A.P. with d=26.

Inﬁnite Geometric
Series
THE INDICATED SUM of the terms of a ﬁnite or inﬁnite sequence is called a ﬁnite or inﬁnite series.
The sums of arithmetic and geometric progressions in the preceding chapter are examples of ﬁnite series.
Of course, it is impossible to add up all the terms of an inﬁnite series; that is, in the usual meaning
of the word sum, there is no such thing as the sum of such a series. However, it is possible to associate
with certain inﬁnite series a well-deﬁned number which, for convenience, will be called the sum of the
series.
Inﬁnite series will be treated in some detail in Part IV. For the study of the inﬁnite geometric series
here, we shall need only to examine the behavior of rn, where jrj < 1, as n increases indeﬁnitely.
EXAMPLE 1.
From the table of values of  1
2
n in Table 13.1, it appears that, as n increses indeﬁnitely,  1
2
n decreases
indeﬁnitely while remaining positive. Moreover, it can be made to have a value as near 0 as we please by choosing n
sufﬁciently large. We describe this state of affairs by saying: The limit of  1
2
n, as n increases indeﬁnitely, is 0.

By examining the behavior of rn for other values of r, it becomes tolerably clear that
The limit of rn, as n increases indefinitely, is 0 when jrj51:
Using a calculator, one can easily see this for very small positive values of r and for negative values of r near 0,
such as r ¼ 0:000001.
THE SUM S of the inﬁnite geometric series
a þ ar þ ar2 þ · · · þ arn1 þ · · ·,
jrj < 1,
is S ¼
a
1  r :
(For a proof, see Problem 13.1.) (Note carefully the jrj < 1 restriction.)

also called the limiting value of the decimal.

Mathematical
Induction
EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR with the process of reasoning, called ordinary induction, in which a
generalization is made on the basis of a number of simple observations.
EXAMPLE 1.
We observe that 1 ¼ 12; 1 þ 3 ¼ 4 ¼ 22; 1 þ 3 þ 5 ¼ 9 ¼ 32; 1 þ 3 þ 5 þ 7 ¼ 16 ¼ 42; and conclude
that
1 þ 3 þ 5 þ · · · þ ð2n  1Þ ¼ n2
or, in words, the sum of the ﬁrst n odd integers is n2.
EXAMPLE 2.
We observe that 2 points determine 1 ¼ 1
2 · 2ð2  1Þ line; that 3 points, not on a line, determine
3 ¼ 1
2 · 3ð3  1Þ lines; that 4 points, no 3 on a line, determine 6 ¼ 1
2 · 4ð4  1Þ lines; that 5 points, no 3 on a line,
determine 10 ¼ 1
2 · 5ð5  1Þ lines; and conclude that n points, no 3 on a line, determine 1
2 nðn  1Þ lines.
EXAMPLE 3.
We observe that for n ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4; 5 the values of
fðnÞ ¼ n4
8  17n3
12 þ 47n3
8
 103n
12 þ 6
are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, respectively, and conclude that f(n) is a prime number for every positive integral value of n.
The conclusions in Examples 1 and 2 are valid as we shall prove later. The conclusion in Example 3 is false since
fð6Þ ¼ 22 is not a prime number.
MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION is a type of reasoning by which such conclusions as were drawn in
the above examples may be proved or disproved.
The steps are
(1)
The verﬁcation of the proposed formula or theorem for some positive integral value of n,
usually the smallest. (Of course, we would not attempt to prove an unknown theorem by
mathematical induction without ﬁrst verifying it for several values of n.)
(2)
The proof that if the proposed formula or theorem is true for n ¼ k; some positive integer, it is
true also for n ¼ k þ 1.
(3)
The conclusion that the proposed formula or theorem is true for all values of n greater than the
one for which veriﬁcation was made in Step 1.

The following analogy is helpful: If one can climb to the ﬁrst step of a ladder, and if for every step
one reaches, one can reach the next step, then one can reach every step of the ladder, no matter how
many steps there are.
EXAMPLE 4.
Prove: 1 þ 3 þ 5 þ · · · þ ð2n  1Þ ¼ n2.
(1)
The formula is true for n ¼ 1 since 1=12 (the ﬁrst step of the ladder).
(2)
Let us assume the formula true for n ¼ k, any positive integer; that is, let us assume that
1 þ 3 þ 5 þ · · · · þ ð2k  1Þ ¼ k2
(for every step you reach· · ·)
ð14:1Þ
We wish to show that, when (14.1) is true, the proposed formula is then true for n ¼ k þ 1; that is, that
1 þ 3 þ 5 þ · · · · þ ð2k  1Þ þ ð2k þ 1Þ ¼ ðk þ 1Þ2
ð · · · you can reach the next.)
ð14:2Þ
[NOTE:
Statements (14.1) and (14.2) are obtained by replacing n in the proposed formula by k and
k þ 1, respectively. Now it is clear that the left member of (14.2) can be obtained from the left
member of (14.1) by adding ð2k þ 1Þ. At this point the proposed formula is true or false
according as we do or do not obtain the right member of (14.2) when ð2k þ 1Þ is added to the
right member of (14.1).]
Adding ð2k þ 1Þ to both members of (14.1), we have
1 þ 3 þ 5 þ · · · þ ð2k  1Þ þ ð2k þ 1Þ ¼ k2 þ ð2k þ 1Þ ¼ ðk þ 1Þ2
ð14:3Þ
Now (14.3) is identical with (14.2); thus, if the proposed formula is true for any positive integer n ¼ k; it is
true for the next positive integer n ¼ k þ 1.
(3)
Since the formula is true for n ¼ k ¼ 1 (Step 1), it is true for n ¼ k þ 1 ¼ 2; being true for n ¼ k ¼ 2, it is
true for n ¼ k þ 1 ¼ 3; and so on. Hence, the formula is true for all positive integral values of n.

Under this assumption we wish to show that

When ð6k þ 1Þ is added to both members of (1), we have on the right
kð3k  2Þ þ ð6k þ 1Þ ¼ 3k2 þ 4k þ 1 ¼ ðk þ 1Þð3k þ 1Þ
Hence, if the formula is true for n ¼ k it is true for n ¼ k þ 1.

Since the formula is true for n ¼ k ¼ 1 (Step 1), it is true for n ¼ k þ 1 ¼ 2; being true for

The theorem is true for n ¼ 1; since x2  y2 ¼ ðx  yÞðx þ yÞ is divisible by x þ y:

Let us assume the theorem true for n ¼ k; a positive integer; that is, let us assume

We wish to show that, when (1) is true.

MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION

Now x2kþ2  y2kþ2 ¼ ðx2kþ2  x2y2kÞ þ ðx2y2k  y2kþ2Þ  x2ðx2k  y2kÞ þ y2kðx2  y2Þ: In the
ﬁrst term ðx2k  y2kÞ is divisible by ðx þ yÞ by assumption, and in the second term ðx2  y2Þ is
divisible by ðx þ yÞ by Step 1; hence, if the theorem is true for n ¼ k; a positive integer, it is true for
the next one, n ¼ k þ 1:
(3)
Since the theorem is true for n ¼ k ¼ 1; it is true for n ¼ k þ 1 ¼ 2; being true for n ¼ k ¼ 2; it is
true for n ¼ k þ 1 ¼ 3; and so on, for every positive integral value of n.

The number of straight lines determined by n > 1 points, no three on the same straight line, is 1
2 nðn  1Þ:
(1)
The theorem is true when n ¼ 2; since 1
2 · 2ð2  1Þ ¼ 1 and two points determine one line.
(2)
Let us assume that k points, no three on the same straight line, determine 1
2 kðk  1Þ lines.
When an aditional point is added (not on any of the lines already determined) and is joined to
each of the original k points, k new lines are determined. Thus, altogether we have 1
2 kðk  1Þ þ k ¼
1
2 kðk  1 þ 2Þ ¼ 1
2 kðk þ 1Þ lines and this agrees with the theorem when n ¼ k þ 1:
Hence, if the theorem is true for n ¼ k; a positive integer greater than 1, it is true for the next
one, n ¼ k þ 1:
(3)
Since the theorem is true for n ¼ k ¼ 2 (Step 1), it is true for n ¼ k þ 1 ¼ 3; being true for
n ¼ k ¼ 3; it is true for n ¼ k þ 1 ¼ 4; and so on, for every possible integral value >1 of n.

and note the following properties:
(1)
The number of terms in the expansion is ðn þ 1Þ.
(2)
The ﬁrst term a of the binomial enters the ﬁrst term of the expansion with exponent n, the
second term with exponent ðn  1Þ, the third term with exponent ðn  2Þ, and so on.
(3)
The second term b of the binomial enters the second term of the expansion with exponent 1, the
third term with exponent 2, the fourth term with exponent 3, and so on.
(4)
The sum of the exponents of a and b in any term is n.
(5)
The coefﬁcient of the ﬁrst term in the expansion is 1, of the second term is n=1, of the third term
is nðn  1Þ
1 · 2 , of the fourth term is nðn  1Þðn  2Þ

, etc.
(6)
The coefﬁcients of terms equidistant from the ends of the expansion are the same. Note that the
number of factors in the numerator and denominator of any coefﬁcient except the ﬁrst and last
is then either the exponent of a or of b, whichever is the smaller.
The above properties may be proved by mathematical induction.

Expand ð3x þ 2y2Þ5 and simplify term by term.
We put the several powers of ð3xÞ in ﬁrst, then the powers of ð2y2Þ, and ﬁnally the coefﬁcients, recalling Property 6

Permutations
ANY ARRANGEMENT OF A SET OF OBJECTS in a deﬁnite order is called a permutation of the set
taken all at a time. For example, abcd, acbd, bdca are permutations of a set of letters, a; b; c; d taken all at
a time.
If a set contains n objects, any ordered arrangement of any r # n of the objects is called a
permutation of the n object taken r at a time. For example, ab, ba, ca, db are permutations of the n ¼ 4
letters a; b; c; d taken r ¼ 2 at a time, while abc; adb; bad; cad are permutations of the n ¼ 4 letters taken
r ¼ 3 at a time. The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is denoted by nPr, where r # n.
THE NUMBER OF PERMUTATIONS which may be formed in each situation can be found by means
of the
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE:
If one thing can be done in u different ways, if after it has been
done in any one of these, a second thing can be done in v different ways, if after it has been done in
any one of these, a third thing can be done in w different ways, . . . , the several things can be done in
the order stated in u · v · w    different ways.
EXAMPLE 1.
In how many ways can 6 students be assigned to (a) row of 6 seats, (b) a row of 8 seats?
(a)
Let the seats be denoted xxxxxx. The seat on the left may be assigned to any one of the 6 students; that is, it may
be assigned in 6 different ways. After the assignment has been made, the next seat may be assigned to any one
of the 5 remaining students. After the assignment has been made, the next seat may be assigned to any one of
the 4 remaining students, and so on. Placing the number of ways in which each seat may be assigned under the x
marking the seat, we have

By the fundamental principle, the seats may be assigned in
6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 ¼ 720 ways
The reader should assure him- or herself that the seats might have been assigned to the students with the
same result.
(b)
Here each student must be assigned a seat. The ﬁrst student may be assigned any one of the 8 seats, the second
student any one of the 7 remaining seats, and so on. Letting x represent a student, we have

PERMUTATIONS OF OBJECTS NOT ALL DIFFERENT.
If there are n objects of which k are
alike while the remaining ðn  kÞ objects are different from them and from each other, it is clear that the
number of different permutations of the n objects taken all together is not n!.
EXAMPLE 2.
How many different permutations of four letters can be formed using the letters of the word
bass?
For the moment, think of the given letters as b; a; s1; s2 so that they are all different. Then
bas1s2
as1bs2
s2s1ba
s1as2b
bs1s2a
bas2s1
as2bs1
s1s2ba
s2as1b
bs2s1a
are 10 of the 24 permutations of the four letters taken all together. However, when the subscripts are removed, it is
seen that the two permutations in each column are alike.
Thus, there are 1 · 2 · 3 · 4
1 · 2
¼ 12 different permutations.
In general, given n objects of which k1 are one sort, k2 of another, k3 of another,. . ., then the number of different
permutations that can be made from the n objects taken all together is
n!
k1! k2! k3! . . .
(See Problem 16.8.)

The number of permutations, nPr, of different objects taken r5n at a time is

The number of permutation of n objects taken n at a time, nPn, is n!:

In forming 5-letter words using the letters of the word EQUATIONS, (a) how many consist only of vowels,
(b) how many contain all of the consonants, (c) how many begin with E and end in S, (d ) how many begin
with a consonant, (e) how many contain N, ( f ) how many in which the vowels and consonants alternate,
(g) how many in which Q is immediately followed by U?
There are 9 letters, consisting of 5 vowels and 4 consonants.
(a)
There are ﬁve places to be ﬁlled and 5 vowels at our disposal. Hence, we can form 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 ¼ 120
words.
(b)
Each word is to contain the 4 consonants and one of the 5 vowels. There are now six things to do: ﬁrst
pick the vowel to be used (in 5 ways), next place the vowel (in 5 ways), and ﬁll the remaining four
positions with consonants.

There are ﬁve things to do: ﬁrst, place the letter N in any one of the ﬁve positions and then ﬁll the other

(a)
The position on the left can be ﬁlled in 9 ways (0 cannot be used), the middle position can be ﬁlled in 9

(b)
We have 6¼0

. Care must be exercised here in choosing the order in which to ﬁll the positions.
If the position on the left is ﬁlled ﬁrst (in 9 ways), we cannot determine the number of ways in which the
position on the right can be ﬁlled since, if the former is ﬁlled with an odd digit there are 4 ways of ﬁlling
the latter but if the former is ﬁlled with an even digit there are 5 ways of ﬁlling the latter.
We ﬁll ﬁrst the position on the right (in 5 ways), then the position on the left (in 8 ways, since one
odd digit and 0 are excluded), and the middle position (in 8 ways, since two digits are now excluded).
Thus, there are 8 · 8 · 5 ¼ 320 numbers.

We have 6¼0

. We note that the argument above excludes the possibility of ﬁrst ﬁlling the
position on the left. But if we ﬁll the ﬁrst position on the right (in 5 ways), were unable to determine
the number of ways the position on the left can be ﬁlled (9 ways if 0 was used on the right, 8 ways if 2, 4,
6, or 8 was used). Thus, we must separate the two cases.
First, we form all numbers ending in 0; there are 9 · 8 · 1 of them. Next, we form all numbers
ending in 2; 4; 6; or 8; there 8 · 8 · 4 of them. Thus, in all, there are 9 · 8 · 1 þ 8 · 8 · 4 ¼ 328 numbers.
As a check, we have 320 odd and 328 even numbers for a total of 648 as found in (a) above.
(d ) A number is divisible by 5 if and only if it ends in 0 or 5. There are 9 · 8 · 1 numbers ending in 0 and
8 · 8 · 1 numbers ending in 5. Hence, in all, there are 9 · 8 · 1 þ 8 · 8 · 1 ¼ 136 numbers divisible by 5.
(e)
The position on the left can be ﬁlled in 4 ways (with 6; 7; 8; or 9Þ and the remaining positions in 9 · 8
ways. Thus,there are 4 · 9 · 8 ¼ 288 numbers.

Solve Problem 16.3 (a), (b), (c), (d) if any digit may be used once, twice, or three times in forming the three-

(a)
The position on the left can be ﬁlled in 9 ways and each of other position can be ﬁlled in 10 ways. Thus,
there are 9 · 10 · 10 ¼ 900 numbers.
(b)
The position on the right can be ﬁlled in 5 ways, the middle position in 10 ways, and the position on the
left in 9 ways. Thus, there are 9 · 10 · 5 ¼ 450 numbers.
(c)
There are 9 · 10 · 5 ¼ 450 even numbers.
(d ) There are 9 · 10 · 1 ¼ 90 numbers ending in 0 and the same number ending in 5. Thus, there are 180
numbers divisible by 5.

Combinations
THE COMBINATIONS of n objects taken r at a time consist of all possible sets of r of the objects,
without regard to the order of arrangement. The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time
will be denoted by nCr.
For example, the combinations of the n ¼ 4 letters a; b; c; d taken r ¼ 3 at a time, are
abc;
abd;
acd;
bcd
Thus, 4C3 ¼ 4. When the letters of each combination are rearranged (in 3! ways), we obtain the 4P3
permutations of the 4 letters taken 3 at a time. Hence, 4P3 ¼ 3!ð4C3Þ and 4C3 ¼4P3=3!. See Chapter 16
for a discussion of permutations.
The number of combinations of n different objects taken r at a time is equal to the number of
permutations of the n objects taken r at a time divided by factorial r, or
nCr ¼ nPr
r! ¼ nðn  1Þ · · · ðn  r þ 1Þ

Derive the formula nCr ¼ nPr

From each of the nCr combinations of n objects taken r at a time, r! permutations can be formed.
Since two combinations differ at least in one element, the nCr · r! permutations thus formed are precisely the
number of permutations nPr of n objects taken r at a time. Thus,

committee is to consist of 3 seniors and 2 juniors, (b) if the committee is to contain at least 3 seniors
and 1 junior?
(a)
With each of the 12C3 selections of 3 seniors, we may associate any one of the 8C2 selections of 2 juniors.
Thus, a committee can be selected in 12C3 · 8C2 ¼ 12 · 11 · 10

3 seniors and 2 juniors can be selected in 6160 ways, and a committee of 4 seniors and 1 junior can be
selected in 12C4 · 8C1 ¼ 3960 ways. In all, a committee may be selected in 6160 þ 3960 ¼ 10 120 ways.

(a)
Since any two points determine a line, there are 10C2 ¼ 45 lines.
(b)
To determine a line through A, one other point must be selected. Thus, there are nine lines through A.
(c)
Since any three of the points determine a triangle, there are 10C3 ¼ 120 triangles.
(d ) Two additional points are needed to form a triangle. These points may be selected from the nine points
in 9C2 ¼ 36 ways.

How many words consisting of 4 consonants and 2 vowels can be formed ?
(c)
How many of the words in (b) begin with R ?
(d ) How many of the words in (c) contain E ?
(a)
The 4 consonants can be selected in 21C4 ways and the 2 vowels can be selected in 5C2 ways. Thus,
the selections may be made in 21C4 ·5C2 ¼ 59 850 ways.
(b)
From each of the selections in (a), 6! words may be formed by permuting the letters. Therefore,
59850 · 6! ¼ 43 092 000 words can be formed.
(c)
Since the position of the consonant R is ﬁxed, we must select 3 other consonants (in 20C3 ways) and
2 vowels (in 5C2 ways), and arrange each selection of 5 letters in all possible ways. Thus, there are
20C3 ·5C2 · 5! ¼ 1 368 000 words.
(d )
Since the position of the consonant R is ﬁxed but the position of the vowel E is not, we must select
3 other consonants (in 20C3 ways) and 1 other vowel (in four ways), and arrange each set of 5 letters
in all possible ways. Thus, there are 20C3 · 4 · 5! ¼ 547 200 words.

(a)
From the 13 spades, 5 can be selected in 13C5 ¼ 1287 ways.
(b)
From the 26 black cards, 5 can be selected in 26C5 ¼ 65 780 ways.
(c)
One card must be selected from the 48 remaining cards. This can be done in 48 different ways.
(d ) A suit can be selected in four ways and three cards from the suit can be selected in 13C3 ways; a second
suit can now be selected in three ways and two cards of this suit in 13C2 ways. Thus, three cards of one
suit and two of another can be selected in 4 ·13C3 · 3 ·13C2 ¼ 267 696 ways.
(e)
Three kings can be selected from the four kings in 4C3 ways, another kind can be selected in 12 ways,
and two cards of this kind can be selected in 4C2 ways. Thus, three kings and another pair can be dealt
in 4C3 · 12 ·4C2 ¼ 288 ways.
( f ) A kind can be selected in 13 ways and three of this kind in 4C3 ways; another kind can be selected in

Probability
IN ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITY that a given event will or will not happen, we may, as in the
case of drawing a face card from an ordinary deck, count the different ways in which this event may or
may not happen. On the other hand, in the case of estimating the probability that a person who is now
25 years old will live to receive a bequest at age 30, we are forced to depend upon such knowledge of
what has happened on similar occasions in the past as is available. In the ﬁrst case, the result in called
mathematical
or
theoretical probability;
in
the
latter
case,
the
result
is
called
statistical
or
empirical probability.
MATHEMATICAL PROBABILITY. If an event must result in some one of n, ðn 6¼ 0Þ different
but equally likely ways and if a certain s of these ways are considered successes and the other f ¼ n  s
ways are considered failures, then the probability of success in a given trial is p ¼ s=n and the probability
of failure is q ¼ f=n. Since p þ q ¼ s þ f
n
¼ n
n ¼ 1, p ¼ 1  q and q ¼ 1  p.
EXAMPLE 1.
One card is drawn from an ordinary deck. What is the probability (a) that it is a red card, (b) that it
is a spade, (c) that it is a king, (d ) that it is not the ace of hearts?
One card can be drawn from the desk in n ¼ 52 different ways.
(a)
A red card can be drawn from the deck in s ¼ 26 different ways. Thus, the probability of drawing a red card is
s=n ¼ 26
52 ¼ 1

(b)
A spade can be drawn from the deck in 13 different ways. The probability of drawing a spade is 13
52 ¼ 1
4.
(c)
A king can be drawn in 4 ways. The required probability is 4
52 ¼ 1
13.
(d )
The ace of hearts can be drawn in 1 way; the probability of drawing the ace of hearts is 1
52. Thus, the probability
of not drawing the ace of hearts is 1  1
52 ¼ 51
52.
(See Problems 18.1–18.4.)
[NOTE:
We write PðAÞ to denote the ‘‘probability that A occurs.’’]
Two or more events are called mutually exclusive if not more than one of them can occur in a single
trial. Thus, the drawing of a jack and the drawing of a queen on a single draw from an ordinary deck are
mutually exclusive events; however, the drawing of a jack and the drawing of a spade are not mutually
exclusive.
EXAMPLE 2.
Find the probability of drawing a jack or a queen from an ordinary deck of cards.
Since there are four jacks and four queens, s ¼ 8 and p ¼ 8

We have veriﬁed
THEOREM A.
The probability that some one of a set of mutually exclusive events will
happen at a single trial is the sum of their separate probabilities of happening.
THEOREM A0.
The probability that A will occur or B will occur, PðA ¨ BÞ ¼ PðAÞ þ PðBÞ 
PðA ˙ BÞ. (NOTE:
‘‘¨’’ refers to set union and ‘‘˙’’ to set intersection.)
A ¨ B is the set of all elements belonging either to A or to B or to both
¼ fxjx is in A or B or bothg.
A ˙ B is the set of all elements common to A and B
¼ fxjx is in A and x is in Bg:
(See Fig. 18-1.)
Fig. 18-1
For example, if A ¼ f1; 2; 3g and B ¼ f2; 3; 7g, then A ¨ B ¼ f1; 2; 3; 7g and A ˙ B ¼ f2; 3g:
Two events A and B are called independent if the happening of one does not affect the happening of
the other. Thus, in a toss of two dice, the fall of either does not affect the fall of the other. However, in
drawing two cards from a deck, the probability of obtaining a red card on the second draw depends
upon whether or not a red card was obtained on the draw of the ﬁrst card. Two such events are called
dependent. More explicitly, if PðA ˙ BÞ ¼ PðAÞ · PðBÞ, then A and B are independent.
EXAMPLE 3.
One bag contains 4 white and 4 black balls, a second bag contains 3 white and 6 black balls, and a
third contains 1 white and 5 black balls. If one ball is drawn from each bag, ﬁnd the probability that all are white.
A ball can be drawn from the ﬁrst bag in any one of 8 ways, from the second in any one of 9 ways, and from the
third in any one of 6 ways; hence, three balls can be drawn from each bag in 8 · 9 · 6 ways. A white ball can be drawn
from the ﬁrst bag in 4 ways, from the second in 3 ways, and from the third in 1 way; hence, three white balls can be
drawn one from each bag in 4 · 3 · 1 ways. Thus the required probability is
4 · 3 · 1
8 · 9 · 6 ¼ 1
36
Now drawing a white ball from one bag does not affect the drawing of a white ball from another, so that here we are
concerned with three independent events. The probability of drawing a white ball from the ﬁrst bag is 4
5, from the
second is 1
9, and from the third bag is 1
6.
Since the probability of drawing three white balls, one from each bag, is 4
8 · 3
9 · 1
6, we have veriﬁed
THEOREM B.
The probability that all of a set of independent events will happen in a single

THEOREM C.
(concerning dependent events). If the probability that an event will happen is p1;
and if after it has happened the probability that a second event will happen is p2;
the probability that the two events will happen in that order is p1p2.
EXAMPLE 4.
Two cards are drawn from an ordinary deck. Find the probability that both are face cards (king,
queen, jack) if (a) the ﬁrst card drawn is replaced before the second is drawn, (b) the ﬁrst card drawn is not replaced
before the second is drawn.
(a)
Since each drawing is made from a complete deck, we have the case of two independent events. The probability
of drawing a face card in a single draw is 12
52; thus the probability of drawing two face cards, under the
conditions imposed, is 12
52 · 12

(b)
Here the two events are dependent. The probability that the ﬁrst drawing results in a face card is 12
52. Now, of the
51 cards remaining in the deck, there are 11 face cards; the probability that the second drawing results in a face
card is 11

If p is the probability that an event will happen and q is the probability that it will

EMPIRICAL PROBABILITY. If an event has been observed to happen s times in n trials, the ratio
p ¼ s=n is deﬁned as the empirical probability that the event will happen at any future trial. The
conﬁdence which can be placed in such probabilities depends in a large measure on the number of
observations used. Life insurance companies, for example, base their preminum rate on empirical
probabilities. For this purpose they use a mortality table based on an enormous number of observations
over the years.
The American Experience Table of Mortality begins with 100 000 persons all of age 10 years and
indicates the number of the group who die each year thereafter. In using this table, it will be assumed
that the laws stated above for mathematical probability hold also for empirical probability.

If two dice are tossed, what is the probability (a) of throwing a total of 7, (b) of throwing a total of 8, (c) of
throwing a total of 10 or more, (d ) of both dice showing the same number?
Two dice may turn up in 6 · 6 ¼ 36 ways.
(a)
A total of 7 may result in 6 ways. (1, 6; 6, 1; 2, 5; 5, 2; 3, 4; 4, 3). The probability of a throw of 7 is then
6
36 ¼ 1

(b)
A total of 8 may result in 5 ways (2, 6; 6, 2; 3, 5; 5, 3; 4, 4). The probability of a throw of 8 is 5
36 .
(c)
Here, success consists in throwing a total of 10, 11, or 12. Since a total of 10 may result in 3 ways, a total
of 11 in 2 ways, and a total of 12 in 1 way, the probability is ð3 þ 2 þ 1Þ=36 ¼ 1

(d ) The probability that the second die will show the same number as the ﬁrst is 1

If ﬁve coins are tossed, what is the probability (a) that all will show heads, (b) that exactly three will show
heads, (c) that at least three will show heads?
Each coin can turn up in 2 ways; hence, the ﬁve coins can turn up in 25 ¼ 32 ways. (The assumption
here is that HHHTT and THHHT are different results.)
(a)
Five heads can turn up in only 1 way; hence, the probability of a toss of ﬁve heads is 1
32.
(b)
Exactly three heads can turn up in 5C3 ¼ 10 ways; thus, the probability of a toss of exactly three heads is
10
32 ¼ 5
16.
(c)
Success here consists of a throw of exactly three, exactly four, or all heads. Exactly three heads can turn
up in 10 ways, exactly four heads in 5 ways, and all heads in 1 way. Thus, the probability of throwing at
least three heads is ð10 þ 5 þ 1Þ=32 ¼ 1

If three cards are drawn from an ordinary deck, ﬁnd the probability (a) that all are red cards, (b) that all are
of the same suit, (c) that all are aces.
Three cards may be drawn from a deck in 52C3 ways.

This problem may also be solved as follows: The ﬁrst card drawn determines a suit. The deck now
contains 51 cards of which 12 are of that suit; hence, the probability that the next two cards drawn will
be of that suit is 12C2=51C2 ¼ 22

arranged in two rows and two columns, is called a determinant of order two. The elements a1 and b2 are

Row 1 consists of a1 and b1. Row 2 consists of a2 and b2. Column 1 consists of a1 and a2, and column 2

Determinants
of Order n
A DETERMINANT of order n consists of n2 numbers called elements arranged in n rows and n columns,
and enclosed by two vertical lines. For example,
D1 ¼ a1
j

D2 ¼ a1
b1
a2

are determinants of orders one, two, three, and four, respectively. In this notation the letters designate
columns and the subscripts designate rows. Thus, all elements with letter c are in the third column and all
elements with subscript 2 are in the second row.
THE MINOR OF A GIVEN ELEMENT of a determinant is the determinant of the elements which
remain after deleting the row and the column in which the given element stands. For example, the minor
of a1 in D4 is
b2
c2
d2
b3
c3
d3
b4
c4
d4


and the minor of b3 is
a1
c1
d1
a2
c2
d2
a4
c4
d4


Note that the minor of a given element contains no element having either the letter or the subscript of the
given element. (See Problem 20.1.)
THE VALUE OF A DETERMINANT of order one is the single element of the determinant.
A determinant of order n > 1 may be expressed as the sum of n products formed by multiplying each
element of any chosen row (column) by its minor and preﬁxing a proper sign. The proper sign associated
with each product is ð1Þiþj, where i is the number of the row and j is the number of the column in which
the element stands. For example, for D3 above,

is the expansion of D3, along the second row. The sign given to the ﬁrst product is 2, since a2 stands in
the second row and ﬁrst column, and ð1Þ2þ1 ¼ 1. In all, there are six expansions of D3 along its rows
and columns yielding identical results when the minors are evaluated.
There are eight expansions of D4 along its rows and columns, of which

All computer mathematics packages of software give you the capability to easily evaluate
determinants. The reader should try at least one of these (Maple, or others) to gain some familiarity with
these kinds of computer computations.
THE COFACTOR OF AN ELEMENT of a determinant is the minor of that element together with the
sign associated with the product of that element and its minor in the expansion of the determinant. The
cofactors of the elements a1; a2; b1; b3; c1; . . . will be denoted by A1; A2; B1; B3; C1; . . .. Thus, the cofactor
of c1 in D3 is C1 ¼ þ a2

PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS.
Subject always to our assumption of equivalent expansions of
a determinant along any of its rows or columns, the following theorems may be proved by mathematical
induction.
CHAP. 20]
DETERMINANTS OF ORDER n

THEOREM I.
If two rows (or two columns) of a determinant are identical, the value of the
determinant is zero. For example,

COROLLARY I.
If each of the elements of a row (or a column) of a determinant is multiplied
by the cofactor of the corresponding element of another row (column), the
sum of the products is zero.
THEOREM II.
If the elements of a row (or a column) of a determinant are multiplied by any
number m, the determinant is multiplied by m. For example,

If each of the elements of a row (or a column) of a determinant is expressed
as the sum of two or more numbers, the determinant may be written as the
sum of two or more determinants. For example,

value of the determinants is unchanged. For example,

EVALUATION OF DETERMINANTS.
A determinant of any order may be evaluated by expanding
it and all subsequent determinants (minors) thus obtained along a row or column. This procedure may
be greatly simpliﬁed by the use of Theorem IV. In Problem 20.6, (a) and (b), a row (column) containing
an element þ1 or 1 is used to obtain an equivalent determinant having an element 0 in another row
(column). In (c) and (d ), the same theorem has been used to obtain an element þ1 or 1; this procedure
is to be followed when the given determinant is lacking in these elements.
The revised procedure consists in ﬁrst obtaining an equivalent determinant in which all the elements,
save one, in some row (column) are zeros and then expanding along that row (column).

Using the ﬁrst column since it contains the element 1 in the ﬁrst row, we obtain an equivalent determinant all of
whose elements, save the ﬁrst, in the ﬁrst row are zeros. We have

Let us assume the theorem true for determinants of order k and consider a determinant D of order
ðk þ 1Þ in which two columns are identical. When D is expanded along any column, other than the two with
identical elements, each cofactor involved is a determinant of order k with two columns identical and, by
assumption, is equal to zero. Thus, D is equal to zero and the theorem is proved by induction.

CRAMER’S RULE STATES THAT:
(a)
If D 6¼ 0, the system (21.1) has the unique solution
x ¼ Nx=D;
y ¼ Ny=D;
z ¼ Nz=D;
w ¼ Nw=D
(See Problems 21.1–21.2.)
(b)
If D ¼ 0 and at least one of Nx; Ny; Nz; Nw 6¼ 0, the system has no solution. For, if D ¼ 0
and Nx 6¼ 0, then x · D ¼ Nx leads to a contradiction. Such systems are called inconsistent.
(See Problem 21.3.)
(c)
If D ¼ 0 and Nx ¼ Ny ¼ Nz ¼ Nw ¼ 0, the system may or may not have a solutions. A system
having an inﬁnite number of solutions is called dependent.
For systems of three or four equations, the simplest procedure is to evaluate D. If D 6¼ 0, proceed as
in (A); if D ¼ 0, proceed as in Chapter 5. (See Problem 21.4.)
SYSTEMS OF m LINEAR EQUATIONS IN n > m UNKNOWNS.
Ordinarily if there are fewer
equations than unknowns, the system will have an inﬁnite number of solutions.
To solve a consistent system of m equations, solve for m of the unknowns (in certain cases for
p < m of the unknowns) in terms of the others. (See Problem 21.5.)
SYSTEMS OF n EQUATIONS IN m < n UNKNOWNS.
Ordinarily if there are more equations than
unknowns the system is inconsistent. However, if p < m of the equations have a solution and if this
solution satisﬁes each of the remaining equations, the system is consistent. (See Problem 21.6.)
A HOMOGENEOUS EQUATION is one in which all terms are of the same degree; otherwise, the
equation is called nonhomogeneous. For example, the linear equation 2x þ 3y  4z ¼ 5 is nonhomoge-
neous, while 2x þ 3y  4z ¼ 0 is homogeneous. (The term ‘‘5’’ in the ﬁrst equation has degree 0, while all
other terms are of degree 1.)
Every system of homogeneous linear equations
a1x þ b1y þ c1z þ · · · ¼ 0
a2x þ b2y þ c2z þ · · · ¼ 0
...
anx þ bny þ cnz þ · · · ¼ 0
always has the trivial solution x ¼ 0; y ¼ 0; z ¼ 0; . . . :
A system of n homogeneous linear equations in n unknowns has only the trivial solution if D, the
determinant of the coefﬁcients, is not equal to zero. If D ¼ 0, the system has nontrivial solutions as well.

Chapter 22
Introduction to
Transformational
Geometry
INTRODUCTION TO TRANSFORMATIONS.
If you look back at previous chapters that included
topics in geometry, you will notice that, while we have concentrated on different topics from chapter to
chapter, all the material had one very important thing in common: The positions of all the geometric
ﬁgures were ﬁxed. In other words, when we considered a triangle such as eABC in Fig. 22-1, we did not
move it. In this chapter, we consider objects in geometry as they change position. These objects (such as
triangles, lines, points, and circles) will move as a result of transformations of the plane.
Fig. 22-1
DEFINITION:
By a transformation of the plane, we mean a rule that assigns to each point in the plane
a different point or the point itself.
Note that each point in the plane is assigned to exactly one point. Points that are assigned to
themselves are called ﬁxed points. If point P is assigned to point Q, then we say that the image of P is Q,
and the image of Q is P.
REFLECTIONS.
Imagine that a mirror is placed along line m in Fig. 22-2. What would be the image
of point S in the mirror? How would you describe S0, the image of S? If we actually placed a mirror along
m, we would see that the image of S lies on l, on the other side of m, and that the distance from S to O is
equal to the distance from O to S0 (see Fig. 22-3). We say that S0 is the image of S under a reﬂection in
line m. Notice that, under this reﬂection, O is the image of O.

Fig. 22-2
Fig. 22-3
DEFINITION:
A reﬂection in line m is a transformation of the plane having the property that
the image of any point S not on m is S 0, where m is the perpendicular bisector of SS 0;
the image of any point O on m is O itself.
We write RmðSÞ ¼ S 0 to mean S 0 is the image of S under the reﬂection in line m.
EXAMPLE 1.
Image of a Point.
Find the image of (a) A, (b) B, (c) C, (d ) AC, and (e) —DAC under the
reﬂection in line t indicated in Fig. 22-4.
Fig. 22-4
SOLUTIONS
(a)
B, because t is the perpendicular bisector of AB
(b)
A
(c)
C, because C is on t
(d )
BC (Why?)
(e)
—DBC, because D and C are ﬁxed, and RtðBÞ ¼ A
EXAMPLE 2.
Image of a Triangle.
What is the image of eABC in Fig. 22-4 under a reﬂection in line t ?
SOLUTION
We saw that RtðAÞ ¼ B, RtðBÞ ¼ A, and RtðCÞ ¼ C; thus, eABC is its own image. See Problems 22.1–22.3.
LINE SYMMETRY.
Notice that the images of angles are angles and the images of segments are
segments under a reﬂection in a line. When a ﬁgure is its own image under a reﬂection in a line (like
eABC in Fig. 22-4), we say the ﬁgure has line symmetry.
CHAP. 22]
INTRODUCTION TO TRANSFORMATIONAL GEOMETRY
137

DEFINITION:
A ﬁgure F exhibits line symmetry if there exists a line l such that the image of F under
a reﬂection in line l is F itself. In this case, l is called a line symmetry or an axis of
symmetry.
Notice that when a ﬁgure exhibits line symmetry, all its points are not necessarily ﬁxed. In Fig. 22-4,
only points C and D are ﬁxed in triangle ABC. See Problems 22.4–22.6.

POINT SYMMETRY.
Not only can we transform the plane by reﬂections in a line, but we can also
reﬂect in a point P. In Fig. 22-7, for example, we can reﬂect Q in the point P by ﬁnding the point Q 0 such
that QP ¼ PQ 0.
DEFINITION:
A reﬂection in the point P is a transformation of the plane such that the image of any
point Q except P is Q 0, where QP ¼ PQ 0, Q, P, and Q 0 are collinear, and the image of
P is P (i.e., P is ﬁxed). If point F is its own image under such a transformation, then
we say F exhibits point symmetry. (Note that QP ¼ PQ 0 means that they are equal in
length. The segments QP and PQ 0 are congruent.

REFLECTIONS AND ANALYTIC GEOMETRY.
Since points can change position in transforma-
tional geometry, analytic geometry is a particularly useful tool for these transformations. Recall that in
analytic geometry, we deal extensively with the positions of points; being able to locate points and
determine distances is of great help in exploring the properties of transformations.

PATTERNS IN REFLECTIONS. We can observe several patterns in the results of Example 7( f ):
1.
The distance from A0 to B0 in Fig. 22-14(a) equals the distance from A to B. In other words,
distance is preserved under a reﬂection. Observe that measures of angles are also preserved.
[CHAP. 22
140
INTRODUCTION TO TRANSFORMATIONAL GEOMETRY

In other words, m—BAO ¼ m—B0A0O in Fig. 22-14(a), and that property appears to hold for
other reﬂections. As you will see, other properties are preserved as well.
2.
Under a reﬂection in the x axis, the point (a; b) moves to (a; b); under a reﬂection in the y axis,
(a; b) moves to (a; b); and under a reﬂection in the origin, (a; b) moves to (a; b). These
patterns hold only for these reﬂections.

TRANSLATIONS.
Let us transform eABC in Fig. 22-16(a) by adding 1 to each x coordinate and 2 to
each y coordinate. The result is shown in Fig. 22-16(b). Notice that eABC does not change shape, but it
does move in the plane, in the direction of ray OD, where D ¼ ð1; 2Þ. The x coordinate of D is the
‘‘amount’’ by which the x coordinates of the triangle are shifted, and the y coordinate of D is the
‘‘amount’’ by which the y coordinates are shifted. We call this kind of transformation a translation.
Fig. 22-16
DEFINITION:
A translation is a transformation of the plane such that the image of every point ða; bÞ is
the point ða þ h; b þ kÞ, where h and k are given values.
CHAP. 22]
INTRODUCTION TO TRANSFORMATIONAL GEOMETRY
141

A translation has the effect of moving every point the same distance in the same direction. We use the
notation Tðh; kÞða; bÞ to mean the image of ða; bÞ under a translation of h units in the x direction and k
units in the y direction.
As in a reﬂection, distance and angle measure are preserved in a translation.

same translation T.

ROTATIONS.
Consider square ABCD in Fig. 22-19(a). Suppose we were to rotate that square
counterclockwise 90– about P, as shown by the arrow. (Imagine that the square is separate from the
page, but held to it by a pin through point P.) Then
The image of B would be A.
The image of D would be C.
The image of C would be B.
The image of A would be D.
Now consider point S in Fig. 22-19(b). We can rotate it counterclockwise by, say, 50– about P, as if
it were one end of a ruler that was nailed to the page at P. The image of S 0 is in the diagram.
In both these rotations, the segment from P to the point being rotated is congruent to the segment
from P to the image of that point.
Fig. 22-19
DEFINITION:
A rotation through an angle of measure y degrees about a point P is a transformation
of the plane such that the image of P is P and, for any point B 6¼ P, the image of B is
B 0, where m5BPB0 ¼ y and BP ¼ B0P:
CHAP. 22]
INTRODUCTION TO TRANSFORMATIONAL GEOMETRY
143

Figure 22-20 shows P; B; B 0, and y. If y > 0, the rotation is counterclockwise. If y < 0, the rotation is
clockwise.
We use the notation RotðP;yÞðBÞ to mean the rotation of point B about point P through y–. Segment
lengths and measures of angles are preserved under rotations.
Let us rotate point B in Fig. 22-21 through 180– about O. The image of B is B 0ð2; 2Þ. Notice that
this is also the image of B under the reﬂection in O.
Fig. 22-20
Fig. 22-21
Now let us rotate point B through 90– about O. The image here is B 00ð2; 2Þ. Notice that this is the
image of B under the reﬂection in the y axis.
Be Careful.
These two similarities of transformations are coincidences. They come about because we
are rotating 90– and 180– about the origin. Do not generalize beyond these cases! Note,
though, that these coincidences yield the following formulas:
RotðP; 90–Þða; bÞ ¼ ðb; aÞ
and
RotðO; 180–Þða; bÞ ¼ ða; bÞ

DILATIONS.
Suppose we blew a balloon up most of the way and traced its outline, and then blew it
up all the way and traced it again. The outlines might look like those in Fig. 22-24. Although the balloon
has changed size from (a) to (b), its shape has not changed. Notice that if C is on AB, then its image C 0 is
on A 0B 0. Such a transformation in the plane is called a dilation (or dilatation). The ‘‘reverse‘‘
transformation is also a dilation: The balloon could be reduced in size in a transformation from that in
(b) to that in (a).
CHAP. 22]
INTRODUCTION TO TRANSFORMATIONAL GEOMETRY
145

Fig. 22-24
DEFINITION:
Given a point P in the plane and a positive number n, a transformation of the plane
having the following properties is called a dilation of n, and P is called the center of
dilation: Point P is ﬁxed, and for any point Q, the image of Q is the point Q0 such that
PQ0 ¼ ðnÞðPQÞ and PQ and PQ0 are identical rays. The point Q0 is usually denoted
DnðQÞ.
Figure 22-25 shows a dilation in which n ¼ 2 and the center of dilation is P. Hence, D2ðAÞ ¼ A0,
D2ðBÞ ¼ B 0, and D2ðPÞ ¼ P. In addition, because n ¼ 2, we know that PA0 ¼ 2PA and PB 0 ¼ 2PB.
Fig. 22-25
Several properties of dilations are evident in Fig. 22-25:
(1)
Dilations do not preserve distance.
(2)
The image of a ﬁgure is similar to the ﬁgure under a dilation. In Fig. 22-25, ePAB , PA 0B 0.
(3)
Angles are preserved under dilations (because of item 2 above).
When the center of a dilation is O ¼ ð0; 0Þ, we can ﬁnd the images of points very easily:
Dnðx; yÞ ¼ ðnx; nyÞ.

Chapter 23
Angles and Arc Length
TRIGONOMETRY, as the word implies, is concerned with the measurement of the parts of a triangle.
Plane trigonometry, considered in the next several chapters, is restricted to triangles lying in planes.
Spherical trigonometry deals with certain triangles which lie on spheres.
The science of trigonometry is based on certain ratios, called trigonometric functions, to be deﬁned
in the next chapter. The early applications of the trigonometric functions were to surveying, navigation,
and engineering. These functions also play an important role in the study of all sorts of vibratory
phenomena—sound, light, electricity, etc. As a consequence, a considerable portion of the subject matter
is concerned properly with a study of the properties of and relations among the trigonometric functions.
THE PLANE ANGLE XOP is formed by the two intersecting half lines OX and OP. The point O is
called the vertex and the half lines are called the sides of the angle. See Fig. 23-1.
Fig. 23-1
More often, a plane angle is to be thought of as generated by revolving (in plane) a half line from the
initial position OX to a terminal position OP: Then O is again the vertex, OX is called the initial side, and
OP is called the terminal side of the angle.
An angle, so generated, is called positive if the direction of rotation (indicated by a curved arrow) is
counterclockwise and negative if the direction of rotation is clockwise. The angle is positive in
Figs. 23-2(a) and (c), and negative in Fig. 23-2(b).

MEASURES OF ANGLES
A.
A degree (–) is deﬁned as the measure of the central angle subtended by an arc of a circle
equal to
1
360 of the circumference of the circle.
A minute ( 0 ) is 1
60 of a degree; a second ( 00 ) is 1
60 of a minute.

A radian (rad) is deﬁned as the measure of the central angle subtended by an arc of a circle equal
to the radius of the circle. See Fig. 23-3.

Trigonometric
Functions of a
General Angle
ANGLES IN STANDARD POSITION.
With respect to a rectangular coordinate system, an angle is
said to be in standard position when its vertex is at the origin and its initial side coincides with the positive
x axis.
An angle is said to be a ﬁrst quadrant angle or to be
in the ﬁrst quadrant if, when in standard
position, its terminal side falls in the quadrant. Similar deﬁnitions hold for the other quadrants. For
example, the angles 30–; 59–; and 330– are ﬁrst quadrant angles; 119– is a second quadrant angle;
119– is a third quadrant angle; 10– and 710– are fourth quadrant angles. See Figs. 24-1 and 24-2.
Two angles which, when placed in standard position, have coincident terminal sides are called
coterminal angels. For example, 30– and 330–; 10– and 710– are pairs of coterminal angles. There are
an unlimited number of angles coterminal with a given angle. (See Problem 24.1.)
The angles 0–; 90–; 180–; 270–, and all angles conterminal with them are called quadrantal angles.
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF A GENERAL ANGLE.
Let y be an angle (not quadrantal) in
standard position and let Pðx; yÞ be any point, distinct from the origin, on the terminal side of the angle.

The six trigonometric functions of y are deﬁned, in terms of the abscissa, ordinate, and distance of P
from the origin O, as follows:
sin y ¼ sin y ¼ ordinate
distance ¼ y
r
cotangent y ¼ cot y ¼ abscissa
ordinate ¼ xy
cosine y ¼ cos y ¼ abscissa
distance ¼ xr
secant y ¼ sec y ¼ distance
abscissa ¼ rx
tangent y ¼ tan y ¼ ordinate
abscissa ¼ y
x
cosecant y ¼ csc y ¼ distance
ordinate ¼ ry
Note that r ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x2 þ y2
p
(see Fig. 24-3).
As an immediate consequence of these deﬁnitions, we have the so-called reciprocal relations:
sin y ¼
1
csc y
tan y ¼
1
cot y
sec y ¼
1
cos y
cos y ¼
1
sec y
cot y ¼
1
tan y
csc y ¼
1
sin f
It is evident from Figs. 24-4(a)–(d ) that the values of the trigonometric functions of y change as
y changes. The values of the functions of a given angle y are, however, independent of the choice of
the point P on its terminal side.

Fig. 24-4
[CHAP. 24
162
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF A GENERAL ANGLE

ALGEBRAIC SIGNS OF THE FUNCTIONS.
Since r is always positive, the signs of the functions in
the various quadrants depend upon the signs of x and y. To determine these signs one may visualize the
angle in standard position or use some device as shown in Fig. 24-5 in which only the functions having
signs are listed.
When an angle is given, its trigonometric functions are uniquely determined. When, however, the
value of one function of an angle is given, the angle is not uniquely determined. For example, if sin y ¼ 1
2 ;
then y ¼ 30–; 150–; 390–; 510–; . . . : In general, two possible positions of the terminal side are found—for
example, the terminal sides of 30– and 150– in Fig. 24-4(a), (b). The exceptions to this rule occur when
the angle is quadrantal. (See Problems 24.2–24.10.)
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF QUADRANTAL ANGLES.
For a quadrantal angle, the
terminal side coincides with one of the axes. A point, P, distinct from the origin, on the terminal side has
either x ¼ 0; y 6¼ 0; or x 6¼ 0; y ¼ 0: In either case, two of the six functions will not be deﬁned. For
example, the terminal side of the angle 0– coincides with the positive x axis and the ordinate of P is 0.
Since the ordinate occurs in the denominator of the ratio deﬁning the contangent and cosecant, these
functions are not deﬁned. Certain authors indicate this by writing cot 0– ¼ 1 and others write cot 0– ¼
6 1 : The trigonometric functions of the quadrantal angles are given in Table 24.1.

In what quadrant will y terminate, if
(a)
sin y and cos y are both negative?
(c)
sin y is positive and secant y is negative?
(b)
sin y and tan y are both positive?
(d ) sec y is negative and tan y is negative?
(a)
Since sin y ¼ y=r and cos y ¼ x=r; both x and y are negative. (Recall that r is always positive.)
Thus, y is a third quadrant angle.
(b)
Since sin y is positive, y is positive; since tan y ¼ y=x is positive, x is also positive. Thus, y is a ﬁrst

(c)
Since sin y is positive, y is positive; since sec y is negative, x is negative. Thus, y is a second
quadrant angle.
(d )
Since sec y is negative, x is negative; since tan y is negative, y is then positive. Thus, y is a second
quadrant angle.
24.4
In what quadrants may y terminate, if
(a)
sin y is positive?
(b)
cos y is negative? (c)
tan y is negative?
(d )
sin y is positive?
(a)
Since sin y is positive, y is positive. Then x may be positive or negative and y is a ﬁrst or second
quadrant angle.
(b)
Since cos y is negative, x is negative. Then y may be positive or negative and y is a second or third
quadrant angle.
(c)
Since tan y is negative, either y is positive and x is negative or y is negative and x is positive. Thus, y
may be a second or fourth quadrant angle.
(d )
Since sec y is positive, x is positive. Thus, y may be a ﬁrst or fourth quadrant angle.

Find the values of cos y and tan y, given sin y ¼ 8

Let P be a point on the terminal line of y. Since sin y ¼ y=r ¼ 8

Acute Angle
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF AN ACUTE ANGLE.
In dealing with any right triangle, it
will be convenient (see Fig. 25-1) to denote the vertices as A, B, C such that C is the vertex of the right
triangle; to denote the angles of the triangle as A, B, C, such that m ]C ¼ 90–; and to denote the sides
opposite the angles as a, b, c, respectively. With respect to angle A, a will be called the opposite side and b
will be called the adjacent side; with respect to angle B, a will be called the adjacent side and b the opposite
side. Side c will always be called the hypotenuse.
If now the right triangle is placed in a coordinate system (Fig. 25-2) so that angle A is in standard
position, point B on the terminal side of angle A has coordinates (b, a) and distance c ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a2 þ b2
p
. Then
the trigonometric functions of angle A may be deﬁned in terms of the sides of the right triangle, as follows:
sin A ¼ a
c ¼ length of opposite side
length of hypotenuse
cot A ¼ b
a ¼ length of adjacent side
length of opposite side
cos A¼ b
c ¼ length of adjacent side
length of hypotenuse
sec A ¼ c
b¼ length of hypotenuse
length of adjacent side
tan A¼ a
b ¼ length of opposite side
length of adjacent side
csc A ¼ c
a ¼ length of hypotenuse
length of opposite side

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEMENTARY ANGLES.
The acute angles A and
B of the right triangle ABC are complementary; that is, m ] A þ m ] B ¼ 90–. From Fig. 25-1,
we have
sin B ¼ b
c ¼ cos A
cot B ¼ a
b ¼ tan A
cos B¼ a
c ¼ sin A
sec B ¼ c
a ¼ csc A
tan B ¼ b
a ¼ cot A
csc B ¼ c
b ¼ sec A
These relations associate the functions in pairs—sine and cosine, tangent and cotangent, secant and
cosecant—each function of a pair being called the cofunction of the other. Thus, any function of an acute
angle is equal to the corresponding cofunction of the complementary angle.
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF 30–, 45–, 60–.

Sin A < cos A when a < b; then A < B or A < 90–  A, and A < 45–.
(f)
Tan A ¼ a=b > 1 when a > b; then A > B and A > 45–.

GENERAL REDUCTION FORMULA.
Any trigonometric function of ðn · 90– 6 yÞ; where y is any
angle, is numerically equal
(a)
To the same function of y if n is an even integer
(b)
To the corresponding cofunction of y if n is an odd integer
The algebraic sign in each case is the same as the sign of the given function for that quadrant in
which n · 90– 6 y lies when y is a positive acute angle.
EXAMPLES
(1)
sin ð180–  yÞ ¼ sin ð2 · 90–  yÞ ¼ sin y since 180– is an even multiple of 90– and, when y is positive acute,
the terminal side of 180–  y lies in quadrant II.
(2)
cos ð180– þ yÞ ¼ cos ð2 · 90– þ yÞ ¼ cos y since 180– is an even multiple of 90– and, when y is positive
acute, the terminal side of 180– þ y lies is quadrant III.
(3)
tan ð270–  yÞ ¼ tan ð3 · 90–  yÞ ¼ cot y since 270– is an odd multiple of 90– and, when y is positive acute,
the terminal side of 270–  y lies in quadrant III.
(4)
cos ð270– þ yÞ ¼ cos ð3 · 90– þ yÞ ¼ sin y since 270– is an odd multiple of 90– and, when y is positive acute,
the terminal side of 270– þ y lies in quadrant IV.

PERIODIC FUNCTIONS.
Any function of a variable x; f ðxÞ; which repeats its values in deﬁnite
cycles, is called periodic. The smallest range of values of x which corresponds to a complete cycle of
values of the function is called the period of the function. It is evident from the graphs of the
trigonometric functions that the sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant are of period 2p while the tangent and
cotangent are of period p.
THE GENERAL SINE CURVE.
The amplitude (maximum ordinate) and period (wavelength) of
y ¼ sin x are, respectively, 1 and 2p. For a given value of x, the value of y ¼ a sin x; a > 0; is a times
the value of y ¼ sin x: Thus, the amplitude of y ¼ a sin x is a and the period is 2p. Since when
bx ¼ 2p; x ¼ 2p=b; the amplitude of y ¼ sin bx; b > 0; is 1 and the period is 2p=b:
The general sine curve (sinusoid) of equation
y ¼ a sin bx;
a > 0;
b > 0;
has amplitude a and period 2p=b: Thus the graph of y ¼ 3 sin 2x has amplitude 3 and period 2p=2 ¼ p:
Figure 27-10 exhibits the graphs of y ¼ sin x and y ¼ 3 sin 2x on the same axes.
Fig. 27-10
COMPOSITION OF SINE CURVES.
More complicated forms of wave motions are obtained by
combining two or more sine curves. The method of adding corresponding ordinates is illustrated in the
following example.

Construct the graph of y ¼ sin x þ 3 sin 2x: See Fig. 27-10.
First the graphs of y1 ¼ sin x and y2 ¼ 3 sin 2x are constructed on the same axes. Then, corresponding to a
given value x ¼ OA1; the ordinate A1B of y ¼ sin x þ 3 sin 2x is the algebraic sum of the ordinates A1B1 of y1 ¼ sin x
and A1C1 of y2 ¼ 3 sin 2x:
Also, A2B ¼ A2B2 þ A2C2; A3B ¼ A3B3 þ A3C3; etc.

for which tan y is deﬁned, i.e., for all y 6¼ n · 90– where n is odd. Note that for the excluded values of y,
cos y ¼ 0 and sin y 6¼ 0.

TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES.
A relation involving the trigonometric functions which is valid for all
values of the angle for which the functions are deﬁned is called a trigonometric identity. The eight fundamental
relations above are trigonometric identities; so also are
cos y csc y ¼ cot y
and
cos y tan y ¼ sin y
of Example 1 above.
A trigonometric identity is veriﬁed by transforming one member (your choice) into the other.
In general, one begins with the more complicated side.
Success in verifying identities requires
(a)
Complete familiarity with the fundamental relations
(b)
Complete familiarity with the processes of factoring, adding fractions, etc.

are positive acute angles.
Let a and b be the measures of positive acute angles such that a þ b < 90– [Fig. 29-1(a)] and a þ b < 90–
[Fig. 29-1(b)].

Using c ¼ 5; cos a ¼ 4
5 ; sin a ¼ 3
5, and a ¼ 36–520. Thus, 4 cos x þ 3 sin x ¼ 5 cos ðx  36–520Þ.

Find the maximum and minimum values of 4 cos x þ 3 sin x on the interval 0 < x < 2p.
From Problem 30.9, 4 cos x þ 3 sin x ¼ 5 cos ðx  36–520Þ.
Now on the prescribed interval, cos y attains its maximum value 1 when y ¼ 0 and its minimum value
1 when y ¼ p. Thus, the maximum value of 4 cos x þ 3 sin x is 5 which occurs when x  36–520 ¼ 0 or when
x ¼ 36–520, while the minimum value is 5 which occurs when x  36–520 ¼ p or when x ¼ 216–520.

Oblique Triangles
AN OBLIQUE TRIANGLE is one which does not contain a right angle. Such a triangle contains either
three acute angles or two acute angles and one obtuse angle.
The convention of denoting the measures of the angles by A, B, C and the lengths of the
corresponding opposite sides by a, b, c will be used here. See Figs. 31-1 and 31-2.
Fig. 31-1
Fig.
31-2
When three parts, not all angles, are known, the triangle is uniquely determined, except in one case
to be noted below. The four cases of oblique triangles are
Case I.
Given one side and two angles
Case II.
Given two sides and the angle opposite one of them
Case III.
Given two sides and the included angle
Case IV.
Given the three sides
THE LAW OF SINES.
In any triangle, the sides are proportional to the sines of the opposite angles,
i.e.,
a
sin A ¼
b
sin B ¼
c
sin C
The following relations follow readily:
a
b ¼ sin A
sin B ;
b
c ¼ sin B
sin C ;
c
a ¼ sin C
sin A :
(For a proof of the law of sines, see Problem 31.1.)

PROJECTION FORMULAS.
In any triangle ABC,
a ¼ b cos C þ c cos B
b ¼ c cos A þ a cos C
c ¼ a cos B þ b cos A
(For the derivation of these formulas, see Problem 31.3.)
CASE 1.
Given one side and two angles
EXAMPLE.
Suppose a, B, and C are given.
To ﬁnd A, use A ¼ 180–  ðB þ C Þ.
To ﬁnd b, use b
a ¼ sin B
sin A whence b ¼ a sin B
sin A :
To ﬁnd c, use c
a ¼ sin C
sin A whence c ¼ a sin C
sin A .
(See Problems 31.4–31.6.)
CASE II.
Given two sides and the angle opposite one of them
EXAMPLE.
Suppose b, c, and B are given.
From sin C
sin B ¼ c
b ;
sin C ¼ c sin B
b
:
If sin C > 1; no angle C is determined.
If sin C ¼ 1; C ¼ 90– and a right triangle is determined.
If sin C < 1, two angles are determined: an acute angle C and an obtuse angle C 0 ¼ 180–  C. Thus, there may
be one or two triangles determined. This is known as the ‘‘ambiguous case.’’
This case is discussed geometrically in Problem 31.7. The results obtained may be summarized as follows:
When the given angle is acute, there will be
(a)
One solution if the side opposite the given angle is equal to or greater than the other given side.
(b)
No solution, one solution (right triangle), or two solutions if the side opposite the given angle is less than
the other given side.
When the given angle is obtuse, there will be
(c)
No solution when the side opposite the given angle is less than or equal to the other given side.
(d ) One solution if the side opposite the given angle is greater than the other given side.
EXAMPLE
(1)
When b ¼ 30; c ¼ 20; and B ¼ 40–; there is one solution since B is acute and b > c.
(2)
When b ¼ 20; c ¼ 30; and B ¼ 40–; there is either no solution, one solution, or two solutions. The
particular subcase is determined after computing sin C ¼ c sin B
b
:
(3)
When b ¼ 30; c ¼ 20; and B ¼ 140–; there is one solution.
(4)
When b ¼ 20; c ¼ 30, and B ¼ 140–, there is no solution.
This, the so-called ambiguous case, is solved by the law of sines and may be checked by the projection formulas.

OBLIQUE TRIANGLES

THE LAW OF COSINES.
In any triangle ABC, the square of any side is equal to the sum of the
squares of the other two sides diminished by twice the product of these sides and the cosine of their
included angle; i.e.,
a2 ¼ b2 þ c2  2bc cos A
b2 ¼ c2 þ a2  2ca cos B
c2 ¼ a2 þ b2  2ab cos C
(For the derivation of these formulas, see Problem 31.11.)
CASE III.
Given two sides and the included angle
EXAMPLE.
Suppose a, b, and C are given.
To ﬁnd c, use c2 ¼ a2 þ b2  2ab cos C.
To ﬁnd A, use sin A ¼ a sin C
c
. To ﬁnd B, use sin B ¼ b sin C
c
.
To check, use A þ B þ C ¼ 180–.
(See Problems 31.12–31.14.)
CASE IV.
Given three sides
EXAMPLE.
With a, b, and c given, solve the law of cosines for each of the angles.
To ﬁnd the angles, use cos A ¼ b2 þ c2  a2
2bc
; cos B ¼ c2 þ a2  b2
2ca
; cos C ¼ a2 þ b2  c2
2ab
:
To check, use A þ B þ C ¼ 180–:
(See Problems 31.15–31.16.)
Solved Problems
31.1

Let ABC be any oblique triangle. In Fig. 31-3(a), angles A and B are acute while in Fig. 31-3(b), angle B
is obtuse. Draw CD perpendicular to AB or AB
 ! extended and denote its length by h.
Fig. 31-3
In the right triangle ACD of either ﬁgure, h ¼ b sin A while in the right triangle BCD, h ¼ a sin B since in
Fig. 31-3(b), h ¼ a sin — DBC ¼ a sin ð180–  BÞ ¼ a sin B: Thus,

In a similar manner (by drawing a perpendicular from B to AC or a perpendicular from A to BC ), we
obtain

Inverse Trigonometric
Functions
INVERSE FUNCTIONS.
The equation
y ¼ 2x þ 3
deﬁnes a unique value of y for each value of x. Similarly, the equation
y ¼ x
2  3
does the same; however, these two equations have an interesting, even provocative, relationship:
If
f ðxÞ ¼ 2x þ 3
and
gðxÞ ¼ x
2  3,
then
f ð g ðxÞÞ ¼ g ð f ðxÞÞ ¼ x
That is, f and g ‘‘undo’’ each other. We call the function g the inverse of f and we call f the inverse of g.
NOTATION.
This relationship is written as follows:
f ¼ g1
and
g ¼ f 1
DEFINITION.
If f and g are functions and if
f ð g ðxÞÞ ¼ g ð f ðxÞÞ ¼ x
for all values of x for which these composites are deﬁned, then we say that f and g are each other’s
inverses.
To determine the equation of an inverse function for y ¼ f ðxÞ, simply solve y ¼ f ðxÞ for x and then
interchange the roles of the two variables.

EXAMPLE.
If f ðxÞ ¼ y ¼ 3x  5,
then
3x ¼ y þ 5
ðinterchange x and y)
and
x ¼ y þ 5
3
(solve for x)
Thus;
f 1ðxÞ ¼ y ¼ x þ 5
3
(interchange x and y)
Note that in Fig. 32-1 f ðxÞ and f 1ðxÞ are mirror images of each other in the line y ¼ x:
Fig. 32-1
The reader should verify that for
gðxÞ ¼ x3;
g1ðxÞ ¼ x1=3:
For
hðxÞ ¼ x2;
x > 0;
h1ðxÞ ¼
ﬃﬃx
p
ð32:1Þ
Note also that if f ðxÞ is not one-to-one, then f 1ðxÞ is not a function. Thus, functions that are not one-to-one do
not have inverse functions. For f ðxÞ ¼ x2, unless we restrict the domain (as we did above in (32.1)), f ðxÞ does not
possess an inverse function.
One particularly important class of inverse functions is the class of inverse trigonometric functions.
INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC RELATIONS.
The equation
x ¼ sin y
ð32:2Þ
deﬁnes a unique value of x for each given angle y. But when x is given, the equation may have no solution
or many solutions. For example: if x ¼ 2, there is no solution, since the sine of an angle never exceeds 1;
if x ¼ 1
2, there are many solutions: y ¼ 30–, 150–, 390–, 510–, 210–, 330–, . . . :
To express y in terms of x, we will write
y ¼ arcsin x
ð32:3Þ
In spite of the use of the word arc, (32.3) is to be interpreted as stating that ‘‘y is an angle whose sine is x.’’
Similarly, we shall write y ¼ arccos x if x ¼ cos y; y ¼ arctan x if x ¼ tan y, etc. An alternate notation
for y ¼ arcsin x is y ¼ sin1 x (and similarly, y ¼ cos1 x, etc., for the other functions). Note that
y ¼ arcsin x, arccos x, etc., are all relations but not functions of x.
GRAPHS OF THE INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC RELATIONS.
The graph of y ¼ arcsin x is the
graph of x ¼ sin y and differs from the graph y ¼ sin x in that the roles of x and y are interchanged.
Thus, the graph of y ¼ arcsin x is a sine curve drawn on the y axis instead of the x axis.
Similarly, the graphs of the remaining inverse trigonometric relations are those of the corresponding
trigonometric functions except that the roles of x and y are interchanged.
CHAP. 32]
INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
223

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS.
It is at times necessary to consider the inverse
trigonometric relations as single-valued (i.e., one value of y corresponding to each admissible value of x).
To do this, we agree to select one out of the many angles corresponding to the given value of x. For
example, when x ¼ 1
2, we shall agree to select the value y ¼ 30–, and when x ¼  1
2, we shall agree to select
the value y ¼ 30–. This selected value is called the principal value of arcsin x. When only the principal
value is called for, we shall write Arcsin x, Arccos x, etc. The portions of the graphs on which the principal
values of each of the inverse trigonometric relations lie are shown in Figs. 32-2(a) through ( f ) by a heavier
line. Note that Arcsin x, Arccos x, etc., are functions of x. They are called the inverse trigonometric
functions. Thus, the portions of the graphs shown in a heavier line are the graphs of these functions. Note
that Sin1 x and Arcsin x are equivalent notations, and the same is true for the other trigonometric
functions.

GENERAL VALUES OF THE INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC RELATIONS. Let y be an inverse
trigonometric relation of x. Since the value of a trigonometric function of y is known, there are
determined in general two positions for the terminal side of the angle y (see Fig. 24-4.). Let y1 and y2
respectively be angles determined by the two positions of the terminal side. Then the totality of values
of y consist of the angles y1 and y2, together with all angles coterminal with them, that is,
y1 þ 2np
and
y2 þ 2np
where n is any positive or negative integer, or is zero.
One of the values y1 or y2 may always be taken as the principal value of the inverse trigonometric
relation with the domains properly restricted.
EXAMPLE.
Write expressions for the general value of (a) arcsin 1
2, (b) arccos ð1Þ, (c) arctan ð1Þ.
(a)
The principal value of arcsin 1
2 is p=6, and a second value (not coterminal with the principal value) is
5p=6. The general value of arcsin 1
2 is given by p=6 þ 2np; 5p=6 þ 2n p, where n is any positive or negative
integer, or is zero.
(b)
The principal value is p and there is no other value not coterminal with it. Thus, the general value is given
by p þ 2np, where n is a positive or negative integer, or is zero.
(c)
The principal value is p=4, and a second value (not coterminal with the principal value) is 3p=4. Thus, the
general value is given by p=4 þ 2np; 3p=4 þ 2np, where n is a positive or negative integer, or is zero.

Chapter 33
Trigonometric
Equations
TRIGONOMETRIC EQUATIONS, i.e., equations involving trigonometric functions of unknown
angles, are called
(a)
Identical equations or identities, if they are satisﬁed by all values of the unknown angles for
which the functions are deﬁned.
(b)
Conditional equations, or equations, if they are satisﬁed only by particular values of the
unknown angles.
For example,
(a)
sin x csc x ¼ 1 is an identity, being satisﬁed by every value of x for which csc x is deﬁned.
(b)
sin x ¼ 0 is a conditional equation since it is not satisﬁed by x ¼ 1
4p or 1
2p.
Hereafter in this chapter we shall use the term ‘‘equation’’ instead of ‘‘conditional equation.’’
A SOLUTION OF A TRIGONOMETRIC EQUATION, as sin x ¼ 0, is a value of the angle x which
satisﬁes the equation. Two solutions of sin x ¼ 0 are x ¼ 0 and x ¼ p.
If a given equation has one solution, it has in general an unlimited number of solutions. Thus, the
complete solution of sin x ¼ 0 is given by
x ¼ 0 þ 2np;
x ¼ p þ 2p
where n is any positive or negative integer or is zero.
In this chapter we shall list only the particular solutions for which 0 # x < 2p.
PROCEDURES FOR SOLVING TRIGONOMETRIC EQUATIONS.
There is no general method
for solving trigonometric equations. Three standard procedures are illustrated below and other
procedures are introduced in the solved problems.
(A)
The equation may be factorable.
EXAMPLE 1.
Solve sin x  2 sin x cos x ¼ 0.
Factoring, sin x  2 sin x cos x ¼ sin xð1  2 cos xÞ ¼ 0, and setting each factor equal to zero, we have
sin x ¼ 0
and
x ¼ 0; p;
1  2 cos x ¼ 0
or
cos x ¼ 1
2
and
x ¼ p

Thus, the required solutions ð0 # x < 2pÞ are x ¼ 0; p=3; p; 5p=3.
(B)
The various functions occurring in the equation may be expressed in terms of a single function.

Thus, the required solutions are x ¼ 0; p=2.
The value x ¼ 3p=2, called an extraneous solution, was introduced by squaring the two members. Note that

COMPLEX NUMBERS.
A number a þ bi, where a and b are real numbers, is called a complex
number. The ﬁrst term a is called the real part of the complex number and the second term bi is called
the pure imaginary part.
Complex numbers may be thought of as including all real numbers and all pure imaginary numbers.
For example, 5 ¼ 5 þ 0i and 3i ¼ 0 þ 3i.
Two complex numbers a þ bi and c þ di are said to be equal if and only if a ¼ c and b ¼ d.
The conjugate of a complex number a þ bi is the complex number a  bi. Thus, 2 þ 3i and 2  3i,
3 þ 4i and 3  4i are pairs of conjugate complex numbers.
ALGEBRAIC OPERATIONS

the numbers were ordinary binomials and replace i 2 by  1.

GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF COMPLEX NUMBERS.
The complex number x þ yi may be
represented graphically by the point P (see Fig. 34-1) whose rectangular coordinates are ðx; yÞ.
The point O, having coordinates (0, 0), represents the complex number 0 þ 0i ¼ 0. All points on the
x axis have coordinates of the form ðx; 0Þ and correspond to real numbers x þ 0i ¼ x. For this reason,
the x axis is called the axis of reals. All points on the y axis have coordinates of the form ð0; yÞ and
correspond to pure imaginary numbers 0 þ yi ¼ yi. The y axis is called the axis of imaginaries. The plane
on which the complex numbers are represented is called the complex plane. See Fig. 34-1.
In addition to representing a complex number by a point P in the complex plane, the number may be
represented by the directed line segment or vector OP. See Fig. 34-2. The vector OP is sometimes
denoted by !
OP and is the directed line segment beginning at O and terminating at P.
Fig. 34-1
Fig. 34-2
GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION.
Let z1 ¼ x1 þ iy1 and
z2 ¼ x2 þ iy2 be two complex numbers. The vector representation of these numbers suggests the
illustrated parallelogram law for determining graphically the sum z1 þ z2 ¼ ðx1 þ iy1Þ þ ðx2 þ iy2Þ, since
the coordinates of the endpoint of the vector z1 þ z2 must be, for each of the x coordinates and the
y coordinates, the sum of the corresponding x or y values. See Fig. 34-3.
Since z1  z2 ¼ ðx1 þ iy1Þ  ðx2 þ iy2Þ ¼ ðx1 þ iy1Þ þ ðx2  iy2Þ, the difference z1  z2 of the two
complex numbers may be obtained graphically by applying the parallelogram law to x1 þ iy1 and
x2  iy2. (See Fig. 34-4.)
In Fig. 34-5 both the sum OR ¼ z1 þ z2 and the difference OS ¼ z1  z2 are shown. Note that the
segments OS and P2P1 (the other diagonal of OP2RP1) are congruent. (See Problem 34.11.)

POLAR OR TRIGONOMETRIC FORM OF COMPLEX NUMBERS.
Let the complex number
x þ yi be represented (Fig. 34-6) by the vector OP. This vector (and hence the complex number) may be
described in terms of the length r of the vector and any positive angle y which the vector makes with the
positive x axis (axis of positive reals). The number r ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x2 þ y2
p
is called the modulus or absolute value of
the complex number. The angle y, called the amplitude of the complex number, is usually chosen as the
smallest, positive angle for which tan y ¼ y=x but at times it will be found more convenient to choose
some other angle coterminal with it.
From Fig. 34-6, x ¼ r cos y; and y ¼ r sin y; then z ¼ x þ yi ¼ r cos y þ ir sin y ¼ rðcos y þ i sin yÞ.
We call z ¼ rðcos y þ i sin y Þ the polar or trigonometric form and z ¼ x þ yi the rectangular form of the
complex number z.

MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION IN POLAR FORM
MULTIPLICATION.
The modulus of the product of two complex numbers is the product of their
moduli, and the amplitude of the product is the sum of their amplitudes.
DIVISION.
The modulus of the quotient of two complex numbers is the modulus of the dividend
divided by the modulus of the divisor, and the amplitude of the quotient is the amplitude
of the dividend minus the amplitude of the divisor. For a proof of these theorems, see
Problem 34.14.
EXAMPLE 7.
Find (a) the product z1z2, (b) the quotient and z1=z2, and (c) the quotient z2=z1 where z1 ¼
2ðcos 300–þ i sin 300–Þ and z2 ¼ 8ðcos 210– þ i sin 210–Þ.
(a)
The modulus of the product is 2ð8Þ ¼ 16. The amplitude is 300– þ 210– ¼ 510–, but following the con-
vention, we shall use the smallest positive coterminal angle 510–  360– ¼ 150–. Thus, z1z2 ¼
16ðcos 150– þ i sin 150–Þ.
(b)
The modulus of the quotient z1=z2 is 2

(c)
The modulus of the quotient z2=z1 is 8

smallest positive coterminal angle 90– þ 360– ¼ 270–. Thus z2=z1 ¼ 4ðcos 270–þ i sin 270–Þ.

The Parabola
THE LOCUS OF A POINT P which moves in a plane so that its distance from a ﬁxed line of the plane
and its distance from a ﬁxed point of the plane, not on the line, are equal is called a parabola.
The ﬁxed point F is called the focus, and the ﬁxed line d is called the directrix of the parabola. The
line $
FD through the focus and perpendicular to the directrix is called the axis of the parabola. The axis
intersects the parabola in the point V, the midpoint of FD, called the vertex.
The line segment joining any two distinct points of the parabola is called a chord. A chord (as BB 0)
which passes through the focus is called a focal chord, while FB and FB 0 are called the focal radii of B
and B 0, respectively. See Fig. 35-1.
Fig. 35-1
THE EQUATION OF A PARABOLA assumes its simplest (reduced ) form when its vertex is at the
origin and its axis coincides with one of the coordinate axes.
When the vertex is at the origin and the axis coincides with the x axis, the equation of the parabola is
y2 ¼ 4px
ð35:1Þ
Then the focus is at F ðp; 0Þ and the equation of the directrix is d : x ¼ p. If p > 0, the parabola opens to
the right; if p < 0, the parabola opens to the left. See Figs. 35-2(a) and (b).

Fig. 35-2
When the vertex is at the origin and the axis coincides with the y axis, the equation of the parabola is
x2 ¼ 4py
ð35:2Þ
Then the focus is at F ð0; pÞ and the equation of the directrix is d : y ¼ p. If p > 0, the parabola opens
upward; if p < 0, the parabola opens downward. See Figs. 35-3(a) and (b).
Fig. 35-3
In either case, the distance from the directrix to the vertex and the distance from the vertex to the
focus are equal to p.
[Some authors deﬁne p > 0 and consider the four cases y2 ¼ 4px, y2 ¼ 4px, x2 ¼ 4py, x2 ¼ 4py.
Other authors label the focus F ð1
2 p; 0Þ and directrix d : x ¼  1
2 p and obtain y2 ¼ 2px, etc.]

or
ðx  hÞ2 ¼ 4pð y  kÞ

when its vertex is at the point ðh; kÞ and its axis is parallel, respectively, to the x axis or the y axis. The
distance between the directrix and vertex and the distance between the vertex and focus are the same as
given in the section above.

EXAMPLE 1.
Sketch the locus and ﬁnd the coordinates of the vertex and focus, and the equations of the axis and
directrix, of the parabola y2  6y þ 8x þ 41 ¼ 0.
We ﬁrst put the equation in the form
ð y  3Þ2 ¼ 8ðx þ 4Þ
ð35:3Þ
and note that, since 4p ¼ 8, the parabola opens to the left. Having located the vertex at Vð4; 3Þ, we draw in the
axis through V parallel to the x axis.
In locating the focus, we move from the vertex to the left (the parabola opens to the left) along the axis a
distance p ¼ 2 to the point F ð6; 3Þ. In locating the directrix, we move from the vertex to the right (away from the
focus) along the axis a distance p ¼ 2 to the point D ð2; 3Þ. The directrix passes through D and is perpendicular to
the axis; its equation is x þ 2 ¼ 0.
Using the point F ð6; 3Þ, if x ¼ 6 on the parabola then ð y  3Þ2 ¼ 8ð6 þ 4Þ and y ¼ 7 or 1. Then
p1ð6; 1Þ and p2ð6; 7Þ lie on the parabola. See Fig. 35-4.

The Ellipse
THE LOCUS OF A POINT P which moves in a plane so that the sum of its distances from two ﬁxed
points in the plane is constant is called an ellipse.
The ﬁxed points F and F 0 are called the foci, and their midpoint C is called the center of the ellipse.
The line  !
FF 0 joining the foci intersects the ellipse in the points V and V0, called the vertices. The segment
V 0V intercepted on the line  !
FF 0 by the ellipse is called its major axis; the segment B 0B intercepted on the
line through C perpendicular to  !
FF 0 is called its minor axis.
A line segment whose extremities are any two points on the ellipse is called a chord. A chord which
passes through a focus is called a focal chord. See Fig. 35-5.
Fig. 35-5
[CHAP. 35
256
THE CONIC SECTIONS

The ellipse may also be deﬁned as the locus of a point which moves so that the ratio of its distance
from a ﬁxed point to its distance from a ﬁxed line is equal to e < 1. The ﬁxed point is a focus F or F 0, and
the ﬁxed line d or d 0 is called a directrix. The ratio e is called the eccentricity of the ellipse.
THE EQUATION OF AN ELLIPSE assumes its simplest (reduced) form when its center is at the origin
and its major axis lies along one of the coordinate axes.
When the center is at the origin and the major axis lies along the x axis, the equation of the ellipse is

Then the vertices are at Vða; 0Þ and V 0ða; 0Þ and the length of the major axis is V 0V ¼ 2a. The length of
the minor axis is B 0B ¼ 2b. The foci are on the major axis at F ðc; 0Þ and F 0ðc; 0Þ where

Since a2 is under the term in y, the major axis is parallel to the y axis. To locate the vertices (the extremities
of the major axis), we move from the center parallel to the y axis a distance a ¼ 5 to the points Vð4; 3Þ and V 0ð4; 7Þ.
To locate the extremities of the minor axis, we move from the center perpendicular to the major axis a distance
b ¼ 3 to the points B 0ð1; 2Þ and B ð7; 2Þ. The lengths of the major and minor axes are 2a ¼ 10 and 2b ¼ 6,

The Hyperbola
THE LOCUS OF A POINT P which moves in a plane so that the absolute value of the difference of its
distances from two ﬁxed points in the plane is constant is called a hyperbola. (Note that the locus consists
of two distinct branches, each of indeﬁnite length.)
The ﬁxed points F and F 0 are called the foci, and their midpoint C is called the center of the
hyberbola. The line  !
FF 0 joining the foci intersects the hyperbola in the points V and V 0, called the
vertices.
The segment V 0V intercepted on the line  !
FF 0 by the hyperbola is called its transverse axis. The line l
through C and perpendicular to  !
FF 0 does not intersect the curve, but it will be found convenient to
deﬁne a certain segment B 0B on l, having C as midpoint, as the conjugate axis. See Fig. 35-8.
Fig. 35-8
A line segment whose extremities are any two points (both on the same branch or one on each
branch) on the hyperbola is called a chord. A chord which passes through a focus is called a focal chord.
The hyperbola may also be deﬁned as the locus of a point which moves so that the ratio of its
distance from a ﬁxed point and its distance from a ﬁxed line is equal to e > 1. The ﬁxed point is a
focus F or F 0 and the ﬁxed line d or d 0 is called a directrix. The ratio e is called the eccentricity of the
hyperbola.
THE EQUATION OF A HYPERBOLA assumes its simplest (reduced) form when its center is at the
origin and its transverse axis lies along one of the coordinate axes.
When the center is at the origin and the transverse axis lies along the x axis, the equation of the
hyperbola is

b2 ¼ 1

Then the vertices are at Vða; 0Þ and V0ða; 0Þ and the length of the transverse axis is V 0V ¼ 2a. The
extremities of the conjugate axis are B 0ð0; bÞ and Bð0; bÞ, and its length is B 0B ¼ 2b. The foci are on the

and the directrices are perpendicular to the transverse axis at distances 6a2=c ¼ 6a=e from the center.
See Figs. 35-9(a) and (b).
Fig. 35-9
THE STRAIGHT LINES with equations y ¼ 6ðb=aÞx are called the asymptotes of the hyperbola (35.6),
and the lines with equations x ¼ 6ðb=aÞy are called the asymptotes of the hyperbola (35.7).
These lines have the property that the perpendicular distance from a point on a hyperbola to one of
them approaches zero as the point moves indeﬁnitely far from the center.

The transverse axis is parallel to the x axis (the positive term contains x). To locate the vertices, we move
from the center along the transverse axis a distance a ¼ 2 to the points Vð1; 1Þ and V 0ð5; 1Þ. To locate
the extremities of the conjugate axis, we move from the center perpendicular to the transverse axis a distance b ¼ 5

The asymptotes pass through C with slopes 6b=a ¼ 65=2; thus, their equations are y  1 ¼ 65=2ðx þ 3Þ.
Combining these two equations, ðx þ 3Þ2=4  ðy  1Þ2=25 ¼ 0. Hence, they may be obtained most readily by the
simple trick of changing the right member of the equation of the hyperbola from 1 to 0. See Fig. 35-10.

Ans.
(a)
The parabola opens to the right (p > 0) with vertex at Vð0; 0Þ. The equation of its axis is y ¼ 0.
Moving from V to the right along the axis a distance p ¼ 4, we locate the focus at F ð4; 0Þ. Moving
from V to the left along the axis a distance p ¼ 4, we locate the point Dð 4; 0Þ. Since the directrix
passes through D perpendicular to the axis, its equation is x þ 4 ¼ 0. If x ¼ 4, then y ¼ 68, so
P2ð4; 8Þ and P1ð4; 8Þ are points on the parabola. See Fig. 35-13(a).
Fig. 35-13
(b)
The parabola opens downward (p < 0) with vertex at Vð0; 0Þ. The equation of its axis is x ¼ 0.
Moving from V downward along the axis a distance p ¼ 9=4, we locate the focus at F ð0; 9=4Þ.
Moving from V upward along the axis a distance p ¼ 9=4, we locate the point Dð0; 9=4Þ; the
equation of the directrix is 4y  9 ¼ 0. P2 is the point ð9=2; 9=4Þ and P1 is ð9=2; 9=4Þ.
See Fig. 35-13 (b).

Here ðy þ 2Þ2 ¼ 20x. The parabola opens to the left ðp < 0Þ with vertex at Vð0; 2Þ. The equation

Here the focus lies to the left of the vertex, and the parabola opens to the left. The directed distance
p ¼ VF ¼ 3 and the equation is ðy  4Þ2 ¼ 12ðx  1Þ.
(d )
Here the focus lies above the directrix and the parabola opens upward. The axis of the parabola
meets the directrix in Dð2; 1Þ and the vertex is at the midpoint Vð2; 1Þ of FD. Then p ¼ VF ¼ 2
and the equation is ðx  2Þ2 ¼ 8ðy  1Þ.

The equation of this parabola is of the form y2 ¼ 4px. If (4,5) is a point on it, then ð5Þ2 ¼ 4pð4Þ,

The cable of a suspension bridge has supporting towers which are 50 ft high and 400 ft apart and is in the
shape of a parabola. If the lowest point of the cable is 10 ft above the ﬂoor of the bridge, ﬁnd the length of a
supporting rod 100 ft from the center of the span.
Ans.
Take the origin of coordinates at the lowest point of the cable and the positive y axis directed
upward along the axis of symmetry of the parabola. Then the equation of the parabola has the form
x2 ¼ 4py. Since (200,40) is a point on the parabola, ð200Þ2 ¼ 4p · 40 or 4p ¼ 1000, and the equation is

Transformation
of Coordinates
THE MOST GENERAL EQUATION of the second degree in x and y has the form
Ax2 þ 2Bxy þ Cy2 þ 2Dx þ 2Ey þ F ¼ 0
ð36:1Þ
If (36.1) can be factored so that we have ðax þ by þ cÞðdx þ ey þ fÞ ¼ 0, the locus consists of two straight
lines; if B ¼ 0; A ¼ C, the locus of (36.1) is a circle; otherwise, the locus is one of the conics of Chapter
35.
The locus of the equation
20x2  24xy þ 27y2 þ 24x  54y  369 ¼ 0
ð1Þ
and the locus of the equation
11x2 þ 36y2  369 ¼ 0
ð2Þ
are identical ellipses. The difference in equations is due to their positions with respect to the coordinate
axes.
In order to make a detailed study of the loci represented by (36.1), say (1), it will be necessary to
introduce some device to change (1) into (2). The operations by which (1) is eventually replaced by (2)
are two transformations. The general effect of these transformations may be interpreted as follows: Each
point (x; y) of the plane remains ﬁxed but changes its name, i.e., its coordinates, in accordance with a
stated law, called the equations of the tranformation.
TRANSLATION OF THE COORDINATE AXES.
Recall that the transformation which moves the
coordinate axes to a new position while keeping them always parallel to their original position is called a
translation. In Fig. 36-1, Ox
 ! and Oy
 ! are the axes and O is the origin of the original system of
coordinates, while O0x0
 
!
and O0y0
 
!
are the axes and O0 is the origin of the new (translated) system.

Fig. 36-1
Each point in the plane will now have two sets of coordinates, the original set being the directed
distances in proper order of the point from the original axes and the new set being the directed
distances from the new axes. In order to avoid errors, we propose to write the coordinates of a point
when referred to the original system as, for example, Aða; bÞ and the coordinates when referred to the
new system as Aðc; dÞ0. Also, we shall ﬁnd it convenient at times to speak of the unprimed and primed
systems.
If the axes with the origin O are translated to a new position with origin O0 having coordinates ðh; kÞ
when referred to the original system and if the coordinates of any point are ðx; yÞ before and ðx0; y0Þ0 after
the translation, then the equations of transformation are
x ¼ x0 þ h
y ¼ y0 þ k
ð36:2Þ
EXAMPLE 1.
By means of a translation, transform 3x2 þ 4y2  12x þ 16y  8 ¼ 0 into another equation which
lacks terms of the ﬁrst degree.
First Solution.
When the values of x and y from (36.2) are substituted in the given equation, we obtain
3ðx0 þ hÞ2 þ 4ðy0 þ kÞ2  12ðx0 þ hÞ þ 16ðy0 þ kÞ  8 ¼ 0
or
3x02 þ 4y02 þ ð6h  12Þx0 þ ð8k þ 16Þy0 þ 3h2 þ 4k2  12h þ 16k  8 ¼ 0
ð3Þ
The equation will lack terms of the ﬁrst degree provided 6h  12 ¼ 0 and 8k þ 16 ¼ 0, that is, provided h ¼ 2
and k ¼ 2. Thus, the translation x ¼ x0 þ 2; y ¼ y0  2 reduces the given equation to 3x 02 þ 4y0236 ¼ 0. The
locus, an ellipse, together with the original and new system of coordinates, is shown in Fig. 36-2.

TRANSFORMATION OF COORDINATES

Second Solution.
We put the given equation in the form
3ðx2  4xÞ þ 4ðy2 þ 4yÞ ¼ 8
and complete the squares to obtain
3ðx2  4x þ 4Þ þ 4ðy2 þ 4y þ 4Þ ¼ 8 þ 3ð4Þ þ 4ð4Þ ¼ 36
or
3ðx  2Þ2 þ 4ðy þ 2Þ2 ¼ 36
ð4Þ
The transformation x  2 ¼ x0; y þ 2 ¼ y0 or x ¼ x0 þ 2; y ¼ y0  2 reduces (4) to 3x 02 þ 4y02 ¼ 36 as
before. (See Problem 36.2–36.3.)
ROTATION OF THE COORDINATE AXES.
Recall that the transformation which holds the origin
ﬁxed while rotating the coordinate axes through a given angle is called a rotation.
If, while the origin remains ﬁxed, the coordinate axes are rotated counterclockwise through an angle
of measure y, and if the coordinates of any point P are ðx; yÞ before and ðx0; y0Þ0 after the rotation, the
equations of transformation are
x ¼ x0cos y  y0sin y
y ¼ x0sin y þ y0cos y
ð36:3Þ
since, from Fig. 36-3,
x ¼ OM ¼ ON  MN ¼ ON  RQ ¼ OQ cos y  QP sin y ¼ x0cos y  y0sin y
and
y ¼ MP ¼ MR þ RP ¼ NQ þ RP ¼ OQ sin y þ QP cos y ¼ x0sin y þ y0cos y

THE SEMIREDUCED FORM OF THE SECOND-DEGREE EQUATION.
Under a rotation of the
coordinate axes with equations of transformation (36.3), the general equation of the second degree
Ax2 þ 2Bxy þ Cy2 þ 2Dx þ 2Ey þ F ¼ 0
ð36:1Þ
becomes
A0x 02 þ 2B0x0y0 þ C0y 02 þ 2D0x0 þ 2E0y0 þ F 0 ¼ 0
ð36:10Þ
where
A0 ¼ A cos 2y þ 2B sin y cos y þ C sin 2y
B0 ¼ ðC  AÞ sin y cos y þ Bðcos 2y  sin 2yÞ
¼ 1
2ðC  AÞ sin 2y þ B cos 2y
C0 ¼ A sin 2y  2 B sin y cos y þ C cos 2y
D 0 ¼ D cos y þ E sin y
E 0 ¼ E cos y  D sin y
F 0 ¼ F
ð36:4Þ
If B 6¼ 0; (36.1 0 ) will lack the term in x0y0 if y is such that 0 < m]y < 90– and tan 2y ¼
2B
A  C when
A 6¼ C; and m]y ¼ 45– when A ¼ C. Under this transformation, the general equation (36.1), takes
the form
A0x 02 þ C0y 02 þ 2D 0x0 þ 2E 0y0 þ F 0 ¼ 0
ð36:1 00Þ
which will be called the semireduced form of the second-degree equation.
Under any rotation of the coordinate axes, the quantities A þ C and B2  AC are unchanged or
invariant; that is, A þ C ¼ A0 þ C 0 and B2  AC ¼ B 02  A0C 0. When (36.1) is transformed into (36.100 )
B 0 ¼ 0 and B2  AC ¼ A0C0. Then
If B2  AC < 0; A0 and C0 agree in sign and (36.1) represents a real ellipse, a point ellipse, or an
imaginary ellipse.
If B2  AC ¼ 0, either A0 ¼ 0 or C0 ¼ 0; now (36.1 00 ) contains either a term in x02 or y02 (but not
both), and (36.1) represent a parabola or a pair of parallel lines.
If B2  AC > 0; A0 and C0 differ in sign and (36.1) represents a hyperbola or a pair of intersecting
lines.
THE REDUCED FORM OF THE SECOND-DEGREE EQUATION.
Under a suitable translation
the semireduced form (36.100 ) of the second-degree equation takes the reduced form
A0x002 þ C0y 00 2 ¼ F 00
when
A0C0 6¼ 0
and
x 00 2 ¼ Gy 00
or
y 00 2 ¼ Hx00
when
A0C0 ¼ 0

If B2  AC 6¼ 0, it is a matter of individual preference whether the rotation is performed before or
after the translation of axes; however, if B2  AC ¼ 0, the axes must be rotated ﬁrst. (See Problems 36.7–
36.9.)

we have Oð3;  4Þ 0:
(b)
For x0 ¼ 0; y0 ¼ 0 the equations of transformation yield x ¼ 3; y ¼ 4; thus, in the unprimed
system we have O0ð3; 4Þ:
(c)
Here x ¼ 5; y ¼ 3; then x0 ¼ 8; y0 ¼ 7: Thus, we have Pð8;  7Þ0:
(d )
Here x0 ¼ 5; y0 ¼ 3; then x ¼ 2; y ¼ 1: Thus, we have Pð2; 1Þ:
(e)
When the values for x and y are substituted in the given equation, we have 2ðx0  3Þ  3ðy0 þ 4Þ þ

the line l.

Transform each of the following equations into another lacking terms of the ﬁrst degree:

x2 þ 4y2  2x  12y þ 1 ¼ 0,
(b)
9x2  16y2  36x  96y  252 ¼ 0;
(c)
xy þ 4x  y  8 ¼ 0:
(a)
Since the given equation lacks a term in xy, we use the second method of Example 1. We have
ðx2  2xÞ þ 4ð y2  3yÞ ¼ 1
ðx2  2x þ 1Þ þ 4 y2  3y þ 9

2 ¼ y0 or
x ¼ x0 þ 1; y ¼ y0 þ 3

(b)
We have
9ðx2  4xÞ  16ðy2 þ 6yÞ ¼ 252
9ðx2  4x þ 4Þ  16ðy2 þ 6y þ 9Þ ¼ 252 þ 36  144 ¼ 144
and
9ðx  2Þ2  16ðy þ 3Þ2 ¼ 144
This equation taken the form 9x 0 2  16y 0 2 ¼ 144 under the transformation x  2 ¼ x0; y þ 3 ¼ y0
or x ¼ x0 þ 2; y ¼ y0  3:
(c)
Since the given equation contains a term in xy, we must use the ﬁrst method of Example 1. We have,
using Equations (36.2),
ðx0 þ hÞðy0 þ kÞ þ 4ðx0 þ hÞ  ðy0 þ kÞ  8 ¼ x0y0 þ ðk þ 4Þx0 þ ðh  1Þy0 þ hk þ 4h  k  8 ¼ 0
The ﬁrst-degree terms will disappear provided k þ 4 ¼ 0 and h  1 ¼ 0, that is, provided we take
h ¼ 1 and k ¼  4. For this choice, the equation becomes x0y0  4 ¼ 0:

TRANSFORMATION OF COORDINATES

36.3
By a translation of the axes, simplify each of the following:
(a)
x2 þ 6x  4y þ 1 ¼ 0,
(b)
y2 þ 4y þ 8x  2 ¼ 0:
(a)
Since the given equation lacks a term in y2; it is not possible to use the second method of Example 1.
Using the transformation (36.2), we ﬁnd
ðx0 þ hÞ2 þ 6ðx0 þ hÞ  4ðy0 þ kÞ þ 1 ¼ x 0 2 þ 2ðh þ 3Þx0  4y0 þ h2 þ 6h  4k þ 1 ¼ 0
If we take h ¼ 3, the term in x0 disappears but it is clear that we cannot make the term in y0 disappear.
However, in this case, we make the constant term
h2 þ 6h  4k þ 1 ¼ ð3Þ2 þ 6ð3Þ  4k þ 1 ¼ 8  4k
disappear by taking k ¼ 2: Thus, the transformed equation becomes
x 0 2  4y 0 ¼ 0
or
x 0 2 ¼ 4y 0
It is now clear that this simpliﬁcation may be effected by the following variation of the second
method of Example 1:
x2 þ 6x ¼ 4y  1
x2 þ 6x þ 9 ¼ 4y  1 þ 9 ¼ 4y þ 8
or
ðx þ 3Þ2 ¼ 4ðy þ 2Þ
Then the transformation x þ 3 ¼ x0; y þ 2 ¼ y0 or x ¼ x0  3; y ¼ y0  2 reduces the equation to
x 0 2 ¼ 4y0.
(b)
We have y2 þ 4y ¼ 8x þ 2, y2 þ 4y þ 4 ¼ 8x þ 2 þ 4 ¼ 8x þ 6; ðy þ 2Þ2 ¼ 8ðx  3

y 0 2 ¼ 8x0 under the transformation x ¼ x0 þ 3

a certain equation of the second degree is reduced to y 00 2 ¼ 8x 00. Sketch the locus, showing each set of

In order to distinguish between the three coordinate systems, we shall use the term unprimed for the
original system, primed for the system after the rotation, and double-primed for the system after the
translation. We begin with the original (unprimed) axes in the usual position.
Now any pair of number, as (12,5), which are proportional respectively to cos y ¼ 12

the coordinates of a point on the x0 axis. With the x0 and y0 axes in position, we next seek the origin O} of the
double-primed system. Using ﬁrst the equations of translation and then the equations of rotation, we ﬁnd

TRANSFORMATION OF COORDINATES

Points in Space
RECTANGULAR COORDINATES IN SPACE.
Consider the three mutually perpendicular planes of
Fig. 37-1. These three planes (the xy plane, the xz plane, the yz plane) are called the coordinate planes;
their three lines of intersection are called the coordinate axes (the x axis, the y axis, the z axis); and their
common point O is called the origin. Positive direction is indicated on each axis by an arrow-tip.
(NOTE:
The coordinate system of Fig. 37-1 is called a left-handed system. When the x and y axes are
interchanged, the system becomes right-handed.)
The coordinate planes divide the space into eight regions, called octants. The octant whose edges are
Ox
$!; Oy
$!; Oz
$! is called the ﬁrst octant; the other octants are not numbered.
Fig. 37-1
Fig. 37-2
Let P be any point in space, not in a coordinate plane, and through P pass planes parallel to the
coordinate planes meeting the coordinate axes in the points A, B, C and forming the rectangular
parallelepiped of Fig. 37-2. The directed distances x ¼ OA; y ¼ OB; z ¼ OC are called, respectively, the
x coordinate, the y coordinate, the z coordinate of P and we write Pðx; y; zÞ.
Since AF > OB and FP > OC, it is preferable to use the three edges OA; AF; FP instead of the
complete parallelepiped in locating a given point.

As standard procedure in representing on paper the left-handed system, we shall draw —xOz measuring 90– and

parallel to the y axis will be drawn about 7

TWO STRAIGHT LINES IN SPACE which intersect or are parallel lie in the same plane; two lines
which are not coplanar are called skew. By deﬁnition, the angle between two directed skew lines as b and
c in Fig. 37-5 is the angle between any two intersecting lines as b 0 and c 0 which are respectively parallel to
the skew lines and similarly directed.

DIRECTION COSINES OF A LINE.
In the plane a directed line l [positive direction upward in
Figs. 37-6(a) and (b)] forms the angles a and b with the positive directions on the x and y axes. However,
in our study of the line in the plane we have favored the angle a over the angle b, calling it the angle of
inclination of the line and its tangent the slope of the line.

or their cosines, cos a and cos b, called direction cosines of the line, might have been used instead of the
slope to give the direction of the line l. Indeed, it will be the direction cosines which will be generalized in
our study of the straight line in space.
Fig. 37-6
Fig. 37-7
The direction of a line in space will be given by the three angles, called direction angles of the line,
which it or that line through the origin parallel to it makes with the coordinate axes. If, as in Fig. 37-7,
the direction angles a; b; g; where O # a; b; g < p, are the respective angles between the positive directions
on the x; y; z axis and the directed line l (positive direction upward), the direction angles of this line when
oppositely directed are a 0 ¼ p  a; b 0 ¼ p  b; g 0 ¼ p  g. Thus, an undirected line in space has two sets
of direction angles a; b; g and p  a; p  b; p  g, and two sets of direction cosines ½cos a; cos b; cos g and
½cos a; cos b; cos g since cos ðp  fÞ ¼ cos f. To avoid confusion with the coordinates of a point,
the triples of direction cosines of a line will be enclosed in a bracket. Thus we shall write l : ½A; B; C to
indicate the line whose direction cosines are the triple A; B; C.
The direction cosines of the l determined by points P1ðx1; y1; z1Þ and P2ðx2; y2; z2Þ and directed from
P1 to P2 are (see Fig. 37-4)

DIRECTION NUMBERS OF A LINE.
Instead of the direction cosines of a line, it is frequently more
convenient to use any triple of numbers, preferably small integers when possible, which are proportional
to the direction cosines. Any such triple is called a set of direction numbers of the line. For example, if the
direction cosines are 2
3 ;  2
3 ;  1

, sets of direction numbers are ½2;  2;  1; ½ 2; 2; 1; ½4;  4;  2; etc.; if

½x2  x1; y2  y1; z2  z1 and ½x1  x2; y1  y2; z1  z2.

THE ANGLE y BETWEEN TWO DIRECTED LINES

is given by
cos y ¼ cos a1cos a2 þ cos b1cos b2 þ cos g1cos g2
ð37:4Þ
(For a proof see Problem 37.9.)
If the two lines are parallel then y ¼ 0 or p; according as the lines are similarly or oppositely directed,
and cos a1cos a2 þ cos b1cos b2 þ cos g1cos g2 ¼ 61: If the sign is þ; then cos a1 ¼ cos a2; cos b1 ¼
cosb2; cos g1 ¼ cos g2; if the sign is ; then cos a1 ¼ cos a2; cos b1 ¼ cos b2; cos g1 ¼ cos g2: Thus,
two undirected lines are parallel if and only if their direction cosines are the same or differ only in sign. In
terms of direction numbers, two lines are parallel if and only if corresponding direction numbers are
proportional.
If the two lines are perpendicular, then y ¼ 1

THE DIRECTION NUMBER DEVICE.
If l1: ½a1; b1; c1 and l2 : ½a2; b2; c2 are two nonparallel lines,
then a set of direction number ½a; b; c of any line perpendicular to both l1 and l2 is given by

These three determinants can be obtained readily as follows:
(1)
Write the two sets of direction numbers in three columns a1

(2)
Repeat the ﬁrst two columns to obtain a1

Then a is the determinant of the ﬁrst and second columns remaining, b is the determinant of the
second and third columns, and c is the determinant of the third and fourth columns. This procedure
will be called the direction number device. Note, however, that it is a mechanical procedure for
obtaining one solution of two homogeneous equations in three unknowns and thus has other
applications.

Simultaneous
Equations Involving
Quadratics
ONE LINEAR AND ONE QUADRATIC EQUATION
Procedure:
Solve the linear equation for one of the two unknowns (your choice) and substitute in the
quadratic equation. Since this results in a quadratic equation in one unknown, the system
can always be solved.
EXAMPLE 1.
Solve the system
4x2 þ 3y3 ¼ 16
5x þ y ¼ 7

Solve the linear equation for y: y ¼ 7  5x. Substitute in the quadratic equation:
4x2 þ 3ð7  5xÞ2 ¼ 16
4x2 þ 3ð49  70 þ 25x2Þ ¼ 16
79x2  210x þ 131 ¼ ðx  1Þð79x  131Þ ¼ 0
and x ¼ 1; 131
79 .
When x ¼ 1; y ¼ 7  5x ¼ 2; when x ¼ 131
79 ; y ¼  102
79 . The solutions are x ¼ 1; y ¼ 2 and x ¼ 131
79 ; y ¼  102
79 .
The locus of the linear equation is the straight line and the locus of the quadratic equation is the ellipse in Fig.
38-1. (See Problems 38.1–38.2.)
TWO QUADRATIC EQUATIONS.
In general, solving a system of two quadratic equations in two
unknowns involves solving an equation of the fourth degree in one of the unknowns. Since the solution
of the general equation of the fourth degree in one unknown is beyond the scope of this book, only those
systems which require the solution of a quadratic equation in one unknown will be treated here.
TWO QUADRATIC EQUATIONS OF THE FORM ax2 þ by2 ¼ c
Procedure:
Eliminate one of the unknowns by the method of addition for simultaneous equations in
Chapter 5.

Solve the system
4x2 þ 9y2 ¼ 72

3x2  2y2 ¼ 19
ð38:2Þ

Multiply ð38:1Þ by 2:

Multiply ð38:2Þ by 9:
27x2  18y2 ¼ 171
Add:
35x2
¼ 315
Then x2 ¼ 9 and x ¼ 63.
When x ¼ 3, (38.1) gives 9y2 ¼ 72  4x2 ¼ 72  36 ¼ 36; y2 ¼ 4, and y ¼ 62.
When x ¼ 3, (38.1) gives 9y2 ¼ 72  36 ¼ 36; y2 ¼ 4, and y ¼ 62.
The four solutions x ¼ 3; y ¼ 2; x ¼ 3; y ¼ 2; x ¼ 3; y ¼ 2; x ¼ 3; y ¼ 2 may also be written as
x ¼ 63; y ¼ 62; x ¼ 63; y ¼ 62. By convention, we read the two upper signs and the two lower signs in the
latter form.
The ellipse and the hyperbola intersect in the points ð3; 2Þ; ð3; 2Þ; ð3; 2Þ; ð3; 2Þ: See Fig. 38-2. (See Problems
38.3–38.4.)

TWO QUADRATIC EQUATIONS, ONE HOMOGENEOUS.
An expression, as 2x2  3xy þ y2,
whose terms are all of the same degree in the variables, is called homogeneous. A homogeneous
expression equated to zero is called a homogeneous equation. A homogeneous quadratic equation in two
unknowns can always be solved for one of the unknowns in terms of the other.

TWO QUADRATIC EQUATIONS OF THE FORM
ax2 þ bxy þ cy2 ¼ d
Procedure:
Combine the two given equations to obtain a homogeneous equation. Solve, as in Example 3,
the system consisting of this homogeneous equation and either of the given equations. (See
Problems 38.6–38.7.)
TWO QUADRATIC EQUATIONS, EACH SYMMETRICAL IN x AND y.
An equation, as
2x2  3xy þ 2y2 þ 5x þ 5y ¼ 1, which is unchanged when the two unknowns are interchanged is called a
symmetrical equation.
Procedure:
Substitute x ¼ u þ v and y ¼ u  v and then eliminate v2 from the resulting equations. (See
Problem 38.8.)
Frequently, a careful study of a given system will reveal some special device for solving it. (See
Problems 38.9–38.13.)

Logarithms
THE LOGARITHM OF A POSITIVE NUMBER N to a given base b (written logb N) is the exponent
of the power to which b must be raised to produce N. It will be understood throughout this chapter that
b is positive and different from 1.
EXAMPLE 1.
(a)
Since 9 ¼ 32; log3 9 ¼ 2.
(b)
Since 64 ¼ 43; log4 64 ¼ 3.
(c)
Since 64 ¼ 26; log2 64 ¼ 6.
(d )
Since 1000 ¼ 103; log10 1000 ¼ 3.
(e)
Since 0:01 ¼ 102; log10 0:01 ¼ 2:
(See Problems 39.1–39.3.) Note that if fðxÞ ¼ bx and gðxÞ ¼ logb x (where b > 0; b 6¼ 1Þ, Then fðgðxÞÞ ¼ b log b x ¼ x,
and gð fðxÞÞ ¼ logbðbxÞ ¼ x. Thus in, f and g are inverse functions.
FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF LOGARITHMS
(1)
The logarithm of the product of two or more positive numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms
of the several numbers. For example,
logbðP · Q · R·Þ ¼ logb P þ logb Q þ logb R
(2)
The logarithm of the quotient of two positive numbers is equal to the logarithm of the dividend
minus the logarithm of the divisor. For example,
logb
P
Q ¼ logb P  logb Q
(3)
The logarithm of a power of a positive number is equal to the logarithm of the number, multiplied
by the exponent of the power. For example,
logb Pn ¼ n logb P
(4)
The logarithm of a root of a positive number is equal to the logarithm of the number, divided by the
index of the root. For example,

(See Problems 39.4–39.7.)
IN NUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS a widely used base for a system of logarithms is 10. Such
logarithms are called common logarithms. The common logarithm of a positive number N=1 is written
log N. These interact well with the decimal number system; for example, log 1000 ¼ log 103 ¼ 3.
AN EXPONENTIAL EQUATION is an equation involving one or more unknowns in an exponent. For
example, 2x ¼ 7 and ð1:03Þx ¼ 2:5 are exponential equations. Such equations are solved by means of
logarithms.
EXAMPLE 2.
Solve the exponential equation 2x ¼ 7.
Take logarithms of both sides: x log 2 ¼ log 7
Solve for x : x ¼ log 7
log 2 ¼ 0:8451
0:3010 ¼ 2:808, approximately.
(See Problem 39.16.)
IN THE CALCULUS the most useful logarithmic function is the natural logarithm in which the base is a
certain irrational number e ¼ 2:71828, approximately.
The natural logarithm of N, ln N, and the common logarithm of N; log N, are related by the formula
ln N > 2:3026 log N
THE CALCULATOR can be used to do logarithmic calculation with extreme ease.

Then x < 0:6760.
Note that we use the inverse function of ln x, ex, to ﬁnd the number corresponding to a given ln x. For log x, we
use its inverse, 10x.

Curves
POWER FUNCTIONS in x are of the form xn. If n > 0, the graph of y ¼ xn is said to be of the parabolic
type (the curve is a parabola for n ¼ 2). If n 5 0, the graph of y ¼ xn is said to be of the hyperbolic type
(the curve is a hyperbola for n ¼ 1).
EXAMPLE 1.
Sketch the graphs of (a) y ¼ x3=2, (b) y ¼ x3=2.
Table 40.1 has been computed for selected values of x. We shall assume that the points corresponding to
intermediate values of x lie on a smooth curve joining the points given in the table. See Figs. 40-1 and 40-2.
(See Problems 40.1–40.3.)
EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS in x are of the form bx where b is a constant. The discussion will be
limited here to the case b > 1.
The curve whose equation is y ¼ bx is called an exponential curve. The general properties of such
curves are

(a)
The curve passes through the point (0, 1).
(b)
The curve lies above the x axis and has that axis as an asymptote.
EXAMPLE 2.
Sketch the graphs of (a) y ¼ 2x, (b) y ¼ 3x. (See Problem 12.4.)
The exponential equation appears frequently in the form y ¼ c ekx where c and k are nonzero constants and
e ¼ 2:71828 . . . is the natural logarithmic base. See Table 40.2 and Figs. 40-3 and 40-4. (See Problems 40.5–40.6.)
THE CURVE WHOSE EQUATION IS y ¼ logb x; b > 1, is called a logarithmic curve. The general
properties are
(a)
The curve passes through the point (1, 0).
(b)
The curve lies to the right of the y axis and has that axis as an asymptote.
EXAMPLE 3.
Sketch the graph of y ¼ log2 x.
Since x ¼ 2y, the table of values in Table 40.3 may be obtained from the table for y ¼ 2x of
Example 2 by interchanging x and y. See Fig. 40-5. (See Problem 40.7.) Note that the graphs of y ¼ 2x
and y ¼ log2 x are symmetric about the line y ¼ x since they are graphs of inverse functions. The same
will be true for y ¼ ax and y ¼ loga x for all a > 0; a 6¼ 1.

Polynomial Equations,
Rational Roots
A POLYNOMIAL EQUATION (or rational integral equation) is obtained when any polynomial in one
variable is set equal to zero. We shall work with polynomials having integral coefﬁcients although many
of the theorems will be stated for polynomial equations with weaker restrictions on the coefﬁcients.
A polynomial equation is said to be in standard form when written as
a0x n þ a1x n1 þ a2x n2 þ    þ an2x2 þ an1x þ an ¼ 0
ð41:1Þ
where the terms are arranged in descending powers of x, a zero has been inserted as coefﬁcient on each
missing term, the coefﬁcients have no common factor except 61, and a0 6¼ 0. (See Problem 41.1.)
A NUMBER r IS CALLED A ROOT of f ðxÞ ¼ 0 if and only if f ðrÞ ¼ 0. It follows that the abscissas of
the points of intersection of the graph of y ¼ f ðxÞ and the x axis are roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0.
THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA.
Every polynomial equation f ðxÞ ¼ 0 has at
least one root, real or complex.
A polynomial equation of degree n has exactly n roots. These n roots may not all be distinct. If r is
one of the roots and occurs just once, it is called a simple root; if r occurs exactly m > 1 times among the
roots, it is called a root of multiplicity m or an m-fold root. If m ¼ 2; r is called a double root; if m ¼ 3, a
triple root; and so on. (See Problems 41.2–41.3.)
COMPLEX ROOTS.
If the polynomial equation f ðxÞ ¼ 0 has real coefﬁcients and if the complex a þ bi
is a root of f ðxÞ ¼ 0, then the complex conjugate a  bi is also a root. (For a proof, see Problem 41.11.)
IRRATIONAL ROOTS.
Given the polynomial equation f ðxÞ ¼ 0, if the irrational number a þ
ﬃﬃ
b
p
,
where a and b are rational, is a root of f ðxÞ ¼ 0, then the conjugate irrational a 
ﬃﬃ
b
p
is also a root. (See
Problem 41.4.)
LIMITS TO THE REAL ROOTS.
A real number L is called an upper limit of the real roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0
if no (real) root is greater than L; a real number l is called a lower limit if no (real) root is smaller than l.
If L > 0 and if, when f ðxÞ is divided by x  L by synthetic division, every number in the third line is
nonnegative, then L is an upper limit of the real roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0.
If l < 0 and if, when f ðxÞ is divided by x  l by synthetic division, the numbers in the third line
alternate in sign, then l is a lower limit of the real roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0.

RATIONAL ROOTS.
A polynomial equation has 0 as a root if and only if the constant term of the
equation is zero.
EXAMPLE 1.
The roots of x5  2x4 þ 6x3  5x2 ¼ x2ðx3  2x2 þ 6x  5Þ ¼ 0 are 0, 0, and the three roots of
x3  2x2 þ 6x  5 ¼ 0.
If a rational fraction p=q, expressed in lowest terms, is a root of (41.1) in which an 6¼ 0, then p is a
divisor of the constant term an and q is a divisor of the leading coefﬁcient of a0 of (41.1). (For a proof, see
Problem 41.12.)
EXAMPLE 2.
The theorem permits us to say that 2
3 is a possible root of the equation 9x4  5x2 þ 8x þ 4 ¼ 0 since
the numerator 2 divides the constant term 4 and the denominator 3 divides the leading coefﬁcient 9. It does not
assure that 2
3 is a root. However, the theorem does assure that neither 1
2 nor  4
5 is a root. In each case the denominator
does not divide the leading coefﬁcient.
If p, an integer, is a root of (41.1) then p is a divisor of its constant term.
EXAMPLE 3.
The possible rational roots of the equation
12x4  40x3  5x2 þ 45x þ 18 ¼ 0
are all numbers 6p=q in which the values of p are the positive divisors 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 of the constant term 18 and the
values of q are the positive divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 of the leading coefﬁcient 12. Thus the rational roots, if any, of the
equation are among the numbers
61; 62; 63; 66; 69; 618; 6 1
2 ; 6 3

THE PRINCIPAL PROBLEM OF THIS CHAPTER is to ﬁnd the rational roots of a given polynomial
equation. The general procedure is this: Test the possible rational roots by synthetic division, accepting
as roots all those for which the last number in the third line is zero and rejecting all those for which it is
not. Certain reﬁnements, which help to shorten the work, are pointed out in the examples and solved
problems below. (See Chapter 43 for a full description of synthetic division.)
EXAMPLE 4.
Find the rational roots of x5 þ 2x4  18x3  8x2 þ 41x þ 30 ¼ 0.
Since the leading coefﬁcient is 1, all rational roots p=q are integers. The possible integral roots, the divisors
(both positive and negative) of the constant term 30, are
61; 62; 63; 65; 66; 610; 615; 630
1 þ 2  18  8 þ 41 þ 30
j1
Try 1:
1 þ 3  15  23 þ 18
1 þ 3  15  23 þ 18 þ 48
Then 1 is not a root. This number ðþ1Þ should be removed from the list of possible roots lest we forget and try it
again later on.
1 þ 2  18  8 þ 41 þ 30
j2
Try 2:
2 þ 8  20  56  30
1 þ 4  10  28 þ 15 þ 0
Then 2 is a root and the remaining rational roots of the given equation are the rational roots of the depressed
equation
x4 þ 4x3  10x2  28x  15 ¼ 0
Now 62, 66, 610, and 630 cannot be roots of this equation (they are not divisors of 15) and should be
removed from the list of possibilities. We return to the depressed equation.

1 þ 4  10  28  15
j3
Try 3:
3 þ 21 þ33 þ 15
1 þ 7 þ 11 þ 5 þ 0
Then 3 is a root and the new depressed equation is
x3 þ 7x2 þ 11x þ 5 ¼ 0
Since the coefﬁcients of this equation are nonnegative, it has no positive roots. We now remove þ3; þ5; þ15 from
the original list of possible roots and return to the new depressed equation.
1 þ 7 þ 11 þ 5
j1
Try  1:
 1 
6  5
1 þ 6 þ 5 þ 0
Then 1 is a root and the depressed equation
x2 þ 6x þ 5 ¼ ðx þ 1Þðx þ 5Þ ¼ 0
has 1 and 5 as roots.
The necessary computations may be neatly displayed as follows:
1 þ 2  18  8 þ 41 þ 30

x ¼ 1; 5
The roots are 2; 3; 1; 1; 5.
Note that the roots here are numerically small numbers; that is, 3 is a root but 30 is not, 1 is a root but 15
is not. Hereafter we shall not list integers which are large numerically or fractions with large numerator or
denominator among the possible roots. (See Problems 41.5–41.9.)

Since f ð1Þ ¼ 0 and f ð2Þ ¼ 0, both 1 and 2 are roots.

Show that the equation in (a) has at least two other roots by ﬁnding them.
From the synthetic division in (a) and the Factor Theorem (Chapter 43),
x4  9x2 þ 4x þ 12 ¼ ðx þ 1Þðx3  x2  8x þ 12Þ
Since 2 is also root of the given equation, 2 is a root of x3  x2  8x þ 12 ¼ 0:
Using synthetic division
1  1  8 þ 12
j2
2 þ 2  12
1 þ 1  6 þ 0
we obtain x3  x2  8x þ 12 ¼ ðx  2Þðx2 þ x  6Þ. Then
x4  9x2 þ 4x þ 12 ¼ ðx þ 1Þðx  2Þðx2 þ x  6Þ ¼ ðx þ 1Þðx  2Þðx þ 3Þðx  2Þ
Thus, the roots of the given equation are 1; 2; 3; 2.
(NOTE:
Since x  2 appears twice among the factors of f ðxÞ, 2 appears twice among the roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0 and
is a double root of the equation.)

The roots are 1; 2; 2; 2; 4; 4; thus, 1 is a simplest root, 2 is a root of multiplicity three or a
triple root, and 4 is a root of multiplicity two or a double root.
(b)
Find all the roots of x2ðx  2Þðx  5Þ ¼ 0.
The roots are 0, 0, 2, 5; 2 and 5 are simple roots and 0 is a double root.

If ax3 þ bx2 þ cx þ d ¼ 0, with integral coefﬁcients, has a rational root r and if c þ ar2 ¼ 0, then all of the
roots are rational.
Using synthetic division to remove the known root, the depressed equation is
ax2 þ ðb þ arÞx þ c þ br þ ar2 ¼ 0
which reduces to ax2 þ ðb þ arÞx þ br ¼ 0 when c þ ar2 ¼ 0. Since its discriminant is ðb  arÞ2, a perfect
square, its roots are rational. Thus, all the roots of the given equation are rational.

Prove: If the polynomial f ðxÞ has real coefﬁcients and if the imaginary a þ bi; b 6¼ 0, is a root of f ðxÞ ¼ 0,
then the conjugate imaginary a  bi is also a root.
Since a þ bi is a root of f ðxÞ ¼ 0; x  ða þ bi Þ is a factor of f ðxÞ. Similarly, if a  bi is to be a root of
f ðxÞ ¼ 0, x  ða  bi Þ must be a factor of f ðxÞ. We need to show then that when a þ bi is a root of f ðxÞ ¼ 0, it
follows that
½x  ða þ bi Þ½x  ða  bi Þ ¼ x2  2ax þ a2 þ b2

ð1Þ
where QðxÞ is a polynomial of degree 2 less than that of f ðxÞ and the remainder Mx þ N is of degree at most
1 in x; that is, M and N are constants.
Since a þ bi is a root of f ðxÞ ¼ 0, we have from ð1Þ,
f ða þ bi Þ ¼ 0 · Qða þ bi Þ þ Mða þ bi Þ þ N ¼ ðaM þ NÞ þ bMi ¼ 0
Then aM þ N ¼ 0 and bM ¼ 0. Now b 6¼ 0; hence, bM ¼ 0 requires M ¼ 0 and then aM þ N ¼ 0
requires N ¼ 0. Since M ¼ N ¼ 0, ð1Þ becomes

Then x2  2ax þ a2 þ b2 is a factor of f ðxÞ as was to be proved.

it is clear that p, being a factor of every term of the left member of the equality, must divide anqn. Since
p=q is expressed in lowest terms, no factor of p will divide q. Hence, p must divide an as was to be

Chapter 42
Irrational Roots of
Polynomial Equations
IF f ðxÞ ¼ 0 IS A POLYNOMIAL EQUATION, the equation f ðxÞ ¼ 0 has as roots the negatives of the
roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0. When f ðxÞ ¼ 0 is written in standard form, the equation whose roots are the negatives of
the roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0 may be obtained by changing the signs of alternate terms, beginning with the second.
EXAMPLE 1
(a)
The roots x3 þ 3x2  4x  12 ¼ 0 are 2; 2; 3; the roots of x3  3x2  4x þ 12 ¼ 0 are 2; 2; 3.

(See Problem 42.1.)
VARIATION OF SIGN.
If, when a polynomial is arranged in descending powers of the variable, two
successive terms differ in sign, the polynomial is said to have a variation of sign.
EXAMPLE 2
(a)
The polynomial x3  3x2  4x þ 12 has two variations of sign, one from þx3 to 3x2 and one from 4x to þ12;
the polynomial x3 þ 3x2  4x  12 has one variation of sign.
(b)
The polynomial 6x4 þ 13x3  13x  6 has one variation of sign; the polynomial 6x4  13x3 þ 13x  6 has three.
Note that here the term with zero coefﬁcient has not been considered.
DESCARTES’ RULE OF SIGNS.
The number of positive roots of a polynomial equation f ðxÞ ¼ 0,
with real coefﬁcients, is equal either to the number of variations of sign in f ðxÞ or to the number
diminished by an even number.
The number of negative roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0 is equal to the number of positive roots of f ðxÞ ¼ 0.
EXAMPLE 3.
Since f ðxÞ ¼ x3  3x2  4x þ 12 of Example 2(a) has two variations of sign, f ðxÞ ¼ 0 has either two
or no positive roots.
Since x3 þ 3x2  4x  12 has one variation of sign, f ðxÞ ¼ 0 has one positive root and f ðxÞ ¼ 0 has one
negative root. (See Problem 42.2.)

IRRATIONAL ROOTS OF POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS

APPROXIMATION OF IRRATIONAL ROOTS
LET f ðxÞ ¼ 0 BE A POLYNOMIAL EQUATION having no rational roots. If the given equation had
rational roots, we suppose that they have been found using synthetic division and that f ðxÞ is then the
last third line in process. (See Chapter 41.)
THE METHOD OF SUCCESSIVE LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS will be explained by means of
examples.
EXAMPLE 5.
The equation f ðxÞ ¼ x3 þ x  4 ¼ 0 has no rational roots. By Descartes’ rule of signs, it has one
positive (real) root and two imaginary roots. To approximate the real root, we shall ﬁrst isolate it as lying between
two consecutive intgers. Since f ð1Þ ¼ 2 and f ð2Þ ¼ 6, the root lies between x ¼ 1 and x ¼ 2: Figure 42-1 exhibits
the portion of the graph of f ðxÞ between ð1; 2Þ and ð2; 6Þ:
Fig. 42-1
Fig. 42-2
Fig. 42-3
In Fig. 42-2, the curve joining the two points has been replaced by a straight line which meets the x axis at R:
We shall take OR, measured to the nearest tenth of a unit, as the ﬁrst approximation of required root and use it to
isolate the root between successive tenths. From the similar triangles RSQ and PTQ;
RS
PT ¼ SQ
TQ
or
RS ¼ SQ
TQ ðPT Þ ¼ 6
8 ð1Þ ¼ 3
4 ¼ 0:7
The ﬁrst approximation of the root is given by OR ¼ OS  RS ¼ 2  0:7 ¼ 1:3. Since f ð1:3Þ ¼ 0:50 and f ð1:4Þ ¼
0:14; the required root lies between x ¼ 1:3 and x ¼ 1:4.
We now repeat the above process using the points ð1:3; 0:50Þ and ð1:4; 0:14Þ and isolate the root between
successive hundredths. From Fig. 42-3,
RS ¼ SQ
TQ ðPT Þ ¼ 0:14
0:64 ð0:1Þ ¼ 0:02
and
OR ¼ OS  RS ¼ 1:4  0:02 ¼ 1:38
is the next approximation. Since f ð1:38Þ ¼ 0:008 (hence, too large) and f ð1:37Þ ¼ 0:059; the root lies between
x ¼ 1:37 and x ¼ 1:38:
Using the points ð1:37; 0:059Þ and ð1:38; 0:008Þ; we isolate the root between successive thousandths. We ﬁnd
(no diagram needed)
RS ¼ 0:008
0:067 ð0:01Þ ¼ 0:001
and
OR ¼ 1:38  0:001 ¼ 1:379
Since f ð1:379Þ ¼ 0:0012 and f ð1:378Þ ¼ 0:0054; the root lies between x ¼ 1:378 and x ¼ 1:379:

EXAMPLE 6.
The equation x3 þ x2 þ x  4 ¼ 0 has no rational roots. By Descartes’ rule of signs, it has one
positive root. Since f ð1Þ ¼ 1 and f ð2Þ ¼ 10; this root is between x ¼ 1 and x ¼ 2: We ﬁrst diminish the roots of the
given equation by 1.

and obtain the equation gðyÞ ¼ y3 þ 4y2 þ 6y  1 ¼ 0 having a root between y ¼ 0 and y ¼ 1: To approximate
it, we disregard the ﬁrst two terms of the equation and solve 6y  1 ¼ 0 for y ¼ 0:1: Since gð0:1Þ ¼ 0:359 and
gð0:2Þ ¼ 0:368; the root of gð yÞ ¼ 0 lies between y ¼ 0:1 and y ¼ 0:2; and we diminish the roots of gð y Þ ¼ 0

Since hð0:05Þ ¼ 0:007 and hð0:06Þ ¼ 0:07; the root of hðzÞ ¼ 0 lies between z ¼ 0:05 and z ¼ 0:06 and we diminish

IRRATIONAL ROOTS OF POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS

Chapter 43
Graphs of Polynomials
THE GENERAL POLYNOMIAL (or rational integral function) of the nth degree in x has the form
f ðxÞ ¼ a0xn þ a1xn1 þ a2xn2 þ    þ an2x2 þ an1x þ an
ð43:1Þ
in which n is a positive integer and the a’s are constants, real or complex, with a0 6¼ 0. Then term a0x n is
called the leading term, an the constant term, and a0 the leading coefﬁcient.
Although most of the theorems and statements below apply to the general polynomial, attention in
this chapter will be restricted to polynomials whose coefﬁcients (the a’s) are integers.
REMAINDER THEOREM.
If a polynomial f ðxÞ is divided by x  h until a remainder free of x is
obtained, this remainder is f ðhÞ. (For a proof, see Problem 43.1.)
EXAMPLE 1.
Let f ðxÞ ¼ x3 þ 2x2  3x  4 and x  h ¼ x  2; then h ¼ 2. By actual division
x3 þ 2x2  3x  4
x  2

6
x  2
or x3 þ 2x2  3x  4 ¼ ðx2 þ 4x þ 5Þðx  2Þ þ 6, and the remainder is 6.
By the remainder theorem, the remainder is
f ð2Þ ¼ 23 þ 2 · 22  3 · 2  4 ¼ 6
FACTOR THEOREM.
If x  h is a factor of f ðxÞ then f ðhÞ ¼ 0, and conversely. (For a proof, see
Problem 43.2.)
SYNTHETIC DIVISION.
By a process known as synthetic division, the necessary work in dividing a
polynomial f ðxÞ by x  h may be displayed in three lines, as follows:
(1)
Arrange the dividend f ðxÞ in descending powers of x (as usual in division) and set down in the
ﬁrst line the coefﬁcients, supplying zero as coefﬁcient whenever a term is missing.
(2)
Place h, the synthetic divisor, in the ﬁrst line to the right of the coefﬁcients.
(3)
Recopy the leading coefﬁcient a0 directly below it in the third line.
(4)
Multiply a0 by h; place the product a0h in the second line under a1 (in the ﬁrst line), add to a1,
and place the sum a0h þ a1 in the third line under a1.
(5)
Multiply the sum in Step 4 by h; place the product in the second line under a2, add to a2, and
place the sum in the third line under a2.
(6)
Repeat the process of Step 5 until a product has been added to the constant term an.

The ﬁrst n numbers in the third line are the coefﬁcients of the quotient, a polynomial of degree n  1,
and the last number of the third line is the remainder f ðhÞ.
EXAMPLE 2.
Divide 5x4  8x2  15x  6 by x  2, using synthetic division.
Following the procedure outlined above, we have

10 þ 20 þ 24 þ 18
5 þ 10 þ 12 þ 9 þ 12
and the remainder isf ð2Þ ¼ 12:
(See Problem 43.4.)
DESCARTES’ RULE OF SIGNS can be used to discuss the number of positive and negative zeros of a
given polynomial (see Chapter 42).
EXAMPLE 3.
Consider the polynomial PðxÞ ¼ 2x2 þ x  4: PðxÞ has one variation of sign (from þ to );
PðxÞ ¼ 2x2  x  4 has one variation of sign (from þ to ). Descrates’ rule of signs tells us that there will be one
positive zero [one variation in sign for PðxÞ] and one negative zero [one variation in sign for PðxÞ].
EXAMPLE 4.
Suppose SðxÞ ¼ x5 þ x4 þ x3  x2 þ 1: SðxÞ has two variations; SðxÞ has three. Thus, SðxÞ has 2 or
0 positive and 3 or 1 negative zeros.
THE GRAPH OF A POLYNOMIAL y ¼ f ðxÞ may be obtained by computing a table of values, locating
the several points ðx; yÞ, and joining them by a smooth curve. In order to avoid unnecessary labor in
constructing the table, the following systematic procedure is suggested:
(1) When x ¼ 0; y ¼ f ð0Þ is the constant term of the polynomial.
(2) Use synthetic division to ﬁnd f ð1Þ; f ð2Þ; f ð3Þ; . . . stopping as soon as the numbers in the third
line of the synthetic division have the same sign.
(3) Use synthetic division to ﬁnd f ð1Þ; f ð2Þ; f ð3Þ; . . . stopping as soon as the numbers in the
third line of the synthetic division have alternating signs.
In advanced mathematics it is proved:
(a)
The graph of a polynomial in x with integral coefﬁcients is always a smooth curve without
breaks or sharp corners.
(b)
The number of real intersections of the graph of a polynomial of degree n with the x axis is
never greater than n.
(c)
If a and b are real numbers such that f ðaÞ and f ðbÞ have opposite signs, the graph has an odd
number of real intersections with the x axis between x ¼ a and x ¼ b.
(d)
If a and b are real numbers such that f ðaÞ and f ðbÞ have the same signs, the graph either does
not intersect the x axis or intersects it an even number of times between x ¼ a and x ¼ b.

It is to be noted that
(a)
The numbers in the third line are all nonnegative for the ﬁrst time in ﬁnding f ð5Þ; they alternate for the ﬁrst
time in ﬁnding f ð2Þ.
(b)
The graph intersects the x axis between x ¼ 2 and x ¼ 1 since f ð2Þ and f ð1Þ have opposite signs,
between x ¼ 0 and x ¼ 1, and between x ¼ 4 and x ¼ 5. Since the polynomial is of degree three, there are
no other intersections.
(c)
Reading from the graph, the x intercepts are approximately x ¼ 1:2; x ¼ 0:5, and x ¼ 4:2.
(d)
Moving from left to right the graph rises for a time, then falls for a time, and then rises thereafter. The
problem of locating the point where a graph ceases to rise or ceases to fall will be considered in a later
chapter. See Fig. 43-2.
(See Problems 43.5–43.9.)

In the division let the quotient be denoted by QðxÞ and the constant remainder by R. Then, since
Dividend = divisor times quotient + remainder;
f ðxÞ ¼ ðx  hÞQðxÞ þ R
is true for all values of x. When x ¼ h, we have
f ðhÞ ¼ ðh  hÞQðhÞ þ R ¼ R
43.2
Prove the Factor Theorem: If x  h is a factor of f ðxÞ then f ðhÞ ¼ 0, and conversely.
By the Remainder Theorem, f ðxÞ ¼ ðx  hÞQðxÞ þ f ðhÞ.
If x  h is a factor of f ðxÞ, the remainder must be zero when f ðxÞ is divided by x  h. Thus, f ðhÞ ¼ 0.
Conversely, if f ðhÞ ¼ 0, then f ðxÞ ¼ ðx  hÞQðxÞ and x  h is a factor of f ðxÞ.

From Table 43.3 it is seen that the graph crosses the x axis between x ¼ 4 and x ¼ 3; x ¼ 1 and
x ¼ 0; x ¼ 1 and x ¼ 2, and x ¼ 2 and x ¼ 3. From the graph in Fig. 43-3, the points of crossing are

Sketch the graph of y ¼ f ðxÞ ¼ x3  5x2 þ 8x  3.
From Table 43.4 (formed for integral values of x from x ¼ 1 to x ¼ 5) it is seen that the graph crosses
the x axis between x ¼ 0 and x ¼ 1. If there are two other real intersections, they are both between x ¼ 1 and
x ¼ 3 since on this interval the graph rises to the right of x ¼ 1, then falls, and then begins to rise to the left
of x ¼ 3.
By computing additional points on the interval (some are shown in the table), we are led to suspect that
there are no further intersections (see Fig. 43-4). Note that were we able to locate the exact points at which
the graph ceases to rise or fall these additional points would not have been necessary.

Sketch the graph y ¼ f ðxÞ ¼ x3  4x2  3x þ 18:
From Table 43.5 it is evident that the graph crosses the x axis at x ¼ 2 and meets it again at x ¼ 3: If
there is a third distinct intersection, it must be between x ¼ 2 and x ¼ 3 or between x ¼ 3 and x ¼ 4:
By computing additional points for x on these intervals, we are led to suspect that no such third intersection
exists.
This function has been selected so that the question of intersections can be deﬁnitely settled. When
f ðxÞ is divided by x þ 2, the quotient is x2  6x þ 9 ¼ ðx  3Þ2 and the remainder is zero. Thus, f ðxÞ ¼
ðx þ 2Þ ðx  3Þ2 in factored form. It is now clear that the function is positive for x > 2; that is, the
graph never falls below the x axis on this interval. Thus, the graph is tangent to the x axis at x ¼ 3; the
point of tangency accounting for two of its intersections with the x axis. (See Fig. 43-5.)

Sketch the graph of y ¼ f ðxÞ ¼ x3  6x2 þ 12x  8.
From Table 43.6 it is evident that the graph crosses the x axis at x ¼ 2 and is symmetrical with respect
to that point [i.e., f ð2 þ hÞ ¼ f ð2  hÞ]. Suppose the graph intersects the x axis to the right of x ¼ 2: Then,
since f ðxÞ is positive for x ¼ 3; 4; 5 and x > 6, the graph is either tangent at the point or crosses the axis twice
between some two consecutive values of x shown in the table. But, by symmetry, the graph would then have
2 þ 2 þ 1 ¼ 5 intersections with the x axis and this is impossible.
When f ðxÞ is divided by x  2, the quotient is x2  4x þ 4 ¼ ðx  2Þ2 and the remainder is zero. Thus,
f ðxÞ ¼ ðx  2Þ3. Now it is clear that the graph lies above the x axis when x > 2 and below the axis when

intersections of the graph and the x axis, the point x ¼ 2 is to be counted three times.

Parametric Equations
IN THIS CHAPTER we consider the analytic representation of a plane curve by means of a pair of
equations, as x ¼ t; y ¼ 2t þ 3; in which the coordinates of a variable point (x, y) on the curve are
expressed as a function of a third variable or parameter. Such equations are called parametric equations
of the curve.
A table of values of x and y is readily obtained from the given parametric equations by assigning
values to the parameter. After plotting the several points (x, y), the locus may be sketched in the usual
manner.
EXAMPLE.
Sketch the locus of x ¼ t; y ¼ 2t þ 3.
We form the table of values (Table 44.1), plot the points (x, y), and join these points to obtain the straight line
shown in Fig. 44-1. (See Problem 44-1.)

At times it will be possible to eliminate the parameter between the two equations and thus obtain the
rectangular equation of the curve. In the example above, the elimination of t is easy and results in y ¼ 2x þ 3: At the
other times, however, it will be impractical or impossible to eliminate the parameter. (See Problem 44.2.)

Parametric representation of a curve is not unique. For example, x ¼ t; y ¼ 2t þ 3; x ¼ 1
2 u; y ¼ u þ 3;
x ¼ v  1, y ¼ 2v þ 1 are parametric representations with parameters t, u, v, respectively, of the straight line whose
rectangular equation is y ¼ 2x þ 3: (See Problems 44.3–44.4.)
PATH OF A PROJECTILE.
If a body is projected from the origin with initial velocity v0 ft/s at an
angle a with the positive x axis and if all forces acting on the body after projection, excepting the force of
gravity, are ignored, the coordinates of the body t seconds thereafter are given by
x ¼ v0t cos a;
y ¼ v0t sin a  1

where g is the acceleration due to gravity. For convenience, we take g ¼ 32 ft=s2. (See Problems 44.5–44.7.)

The table of values and sketch of each are given in Figs. 44-2 to 44-5. In Fig. 44-3, t ¼ 0; hence,
we must examine the locus for values of t near 0. In Fig. 44-4 the complete locus is described on the
interval 0 # y # 2p: In Fig. 44-5 the complete locus is described on the interval 0 # y # p: Note that only
that part of the parabola below y ¼ 1 is obtained; thus the complete parabola is not deﬁned by the

Show that x ¼ a cos y; y ¼ b sin y; a > b; are parametric equations of an ellipse.
(b)
Show that these equations indicate the following method for constructing an ellipse whose major
and minor axes 2a and 2b are given: With the origin as common center draw two circles having
radii a and b. Through the origin draw a half line l meeting the smaller circle in B and the larger
circle in A. From A drop a perpendicular to the x axis meeting it in R; from B drop a
perpendicular to the x axis meeting it in S and a perpendicular to RA meeting it in P. Then as l
revolves about O, P describes the ellipse.

We have cos y ¼ x=a and sin y ¼ y=b; then x2=a2 þ y2=b2 ¼ cos 2 y þ sin 2 y ¼ 1 is the equation of an
ellipse.

In Fig. 44-6, let P have coordinates ðx; yÞ and denote by y the angle which l makes with the positive
x axis. Then x ¼ OR ¼ OA cos y ¼ a cos y and y ¼ RP ¼ SB ¼ OB sin y ¼ b sin y are parametric
equations of the ellipse whose major and minor axes are a and b.

A body is projected from the origin with initial velocity v0 ft/s at an angle a with the positive x axis.
Assuming that the only force acting upon the body after projection is the attraction of the earth, obtain
parametric equations of the path of the body with t (the number of seconds after projection) as
parameter.
If a body is released near the surface of the earth and all forces acting upon it other than gravity are
neglected, the distance s ft through which it will fall in t seconds is given by s ¼ 1
2 gt2. where g ¼ 32 ft=s2
approximately.
If a body is given motion as stated in the problem and if after projection no other force acts on it, the
motion is in a straight line (Newtons’s ﬁrst law of motion) and after t seconds the body has coordinates
ðv0t cos a; v0t sin aÞ.
Since, when small distances are involved, the force of gravity may be assumed to act vertically, the
coordinates of the projected body after t seconds of motion are given by

The locus of a ﬁxed point P on the circumference of a circle of radius a as the circle rolls without slipping
along a straight line is called a cycloid. Obtain parametric equations of this locus.
Take the x axis to be the line along which the circle is to roll and place the circle initially with its
center C on the y axis and P at the origin. Figure 44-9 shows the position of P after the circle has rolled
through an angle y. Drop perpendiculars PR and CS to the x axis and PA to SC. Let P have
coordinates ðx; yÞ. Then
x ¼ OR ¼ OS  RS ¼ arc PS  PA ¼ ay  a sin y
and
y ¼ RP ¼ SA ¼ SC  AC ¼ a  a cos y
Thus, the equations of the locus are x ¼ aðy  sin yÞ; y ¼ að1  cos yÞ.
The maximum height of an arch is 2a, the diameter of the circle, and the span of an arch or the distance
between two consecutive cusps is 2pa, the circumference of the circle.

Chapter 45
The Derivative
IN THIS AND SUBSEQUENT CHAPTERS, it will be understood that number refers always to a real
number, that the range of any variable ðsuch as xÞ is a set of real numbers, and that a function of one
variable ½such as f ðxÞ is a single-valued function.
In this chapter a procedure is given by which from a given function y ¼ f ðxÞ another function,
denoted by y 0 or f 0ðxÞ and called the derivative of y or of f ðxÞ with respect to x; is obtained. Depending
upon the quantities denoted by x and y ¼ f ðxÞ; the derivative may be interpreted as the slope of a
tangent line to a curve, as velocity, as acceleration, etc.
LIMIT OF A FUNCTION.
A given function f ðxÞ is said to have a limit M as x approaches c
[in symbols, lim
x!c f ðxÞ ¼ M  if f ðxÞ can be made as close to M as we please for all values of x 6¼ c but
sufﬁciently near to c, by having x get sufﬁciently close to c (approaching both from the left and right).
EXAMPLE 1.
Consider f ðxÞ ¼ x2  2 for x near 3.
If x is near to 3, say 2:99 < x < 3:01; then ð2:99Þ2  2 < f ðxÞ < ð3:01Þ2  2 or 6:9401 < f ðxÞ < 7:0601:
If x is nearer to 3, say 2:999 < x < 3:001; then ð2:999Þ2  2 < f ðxÞ < ð3:001Þ2  2 or 6:994001 < f ðxÞ < 7:006001:
If x is still nearer to 3, say 2:9999 < x < 3:0001; then ð2:9999Þ2  2 < f ðxÞ < ð3:0001Þ2  2 or 6:99940001 <
f ðxÞ < 7:00060001:
It appears reasonable to conclude that as x is taken in a smaller and smaller interval about 3, the corresponding
f ðxÞ will lie a smaller and smaller interval about 7. Conversely, it seems reasonable to conclude that if we demand
that f ðxÞ have values lying in smaller and smaller intervals about 7, we need only to choose x in sufﬁciently smaller
and smaller intervals about 3. Thus we conclude
lim
x!3 ðx2  2Þ ¼ 7
EXAMPLE 2.
Consider f ðxÞ ¼ x2  x  6
x  3
for x near 3.
When x 6¼ 3; f ðxÞ ¼ x2  x  6
x  3
¼ x þ 2: Thus, for x near 3, x þ 2 is near to 5 and
lim
x!3
x2  x  6
x  3

ONE-SIDED LIMITS.
We say that the limit of f ðxÞ as x approaches a from the left is L½ lim
x!a f ðxÞ ¼ L
when f ðxÞ gets arbitrarily close to L as x approaches a from the left-hand side of a. [Similarly,
lim
x!bþ f ðxÞ ¼ M is the right-hand limit.] Clearly, if lim
x!a f ðxÞ ¼ lim
x!aþ f ðxÞ ¼ L, then lim
x!a f ðxÞ ¼ L:

Note that in these four statements, the assumption that M and N exist is essential. (See Problem 45.2.)
CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS.
A function f ðxÞ is called continuous at x ¼ c; provided
(1)
f ðcÞ is deﬁned,
(2)
lim
x!c f ðxÞ exists,
(3)
lim
x!c f ðxÞ ¼ f ðcÞ:
EXAMPLE 3.
(a)
The function f ðxÞ ¼ x2  2 of Example 1 is continuous at x ¼ 3 since (1 ) f ð3Þ ¼ 7, (2 ) lim
x!3 ðx2  2Þ ¼ 7,
(3) lim
x!3 ðx2  2Þ ¼ f ð3Þ:
(b)
The function f ðxÞ ¼ x2  x  6
x  3
of Example 2 is not continuous at x ¼ 3, since f ð3Þ is not deﬁned. (See
Problem 45.2.)
A function f ðxÞ is said to be continuous on the interval (a; b) if it is continuous for every value of x of the
interval. A polynomial in x is continuous since it continuous for all values of x. A rational function in x; f ðxÞ ¼
PðxÞ=QðxÞ; where PðxÞ and QðxÞ are polynomials, is continuous for all values of x except those for which QðxÞ ¼ 0:
Thus, f ðxÞ ¼
x2 þ x þ 1
ðx  1Þðx2 þ 2Þ is continuous for all values of x; except x ¼ 1.
CONTINUITY ON A CLOSED INTERVAL.
If a function y ¼ gðxÞ is continuous for all values of x in
½a; b; then it is continuous on ða; bÞ and also at a and b.
However, in this case, gðxÞ is continuous at a means lim
x!aþ gðxÞ ¼ gðaÞ; similarly, lim
x!b gðxÞ ¼ gðbÞ:
(See Problem 45.4.)
INCREMENTS.
Let x0 and x1 be two distinct values of x. It is customary to denote their difference
x1  x0 by Dx (read, delta x) and to write x0 þ Dx for x1.
Now if y ¼ f ðxÞ and if x changes in value from x ¼ x0 to x ¼ x0 þ Dx; y will change in value from
y0 ¼ f ðx0Þ to y0 þ Dy ¼ f ðx0 þ DxÞ. The change in y due to a change in x from x ¼ x0 to x ¼ x0 þ Dx is
Dy ¼ f ðx0 þ DxÞ  f ðx0Þ:
EXAMPLE 4.
Compute the change in y ¼ f ðxÞ ¼ x2  2x þ 5 when x changes in value from (a) x ¼ 3 to x ¼ 3:2;
(b) x ¼ 3 to x ¼ 2:9.
(a)
Take x0 ¼ 3 and Dx ¼ 0:2: Then y0 ¼ f ðx0Þ ¼ f ð3Þ ¼ 8; y0 þ Dy ¼ f ðx0 þ DxÞ ¼ f ð3:2Þ ¼ 8:84; and Dy ¼
8:84  8 ¼ 0:84:
(b)
Take x0 ¼ 3 and Dx ¼ 0:1: Then y0 ¼ f ð3Þ ¼ 8; y0 þ Dy ¼ f ð2:9Þ ¼ 7:61; and Dy ¼ 7:61  8 ¼ 0:39:

If in the example above the subscript 0 is deleted, the ﬁve-step rule yields a function of x (here, 4x  3Þ called the
derivative with respect to x of the given function. The derivative with respect to x of the function y ¼ f ðxÞ is denoted
by one of the symbols y 0; dy

HIGHER-ORDER DERIVATIVES.
The process of ﬁnding the derivative of a given function is called
differentiation.
By differentiation, we obtain from a given function y ¼ f ðxÞ another function y 0 ¼ f 0ðxÞ which will
now be called the first derivative of y or of f ðxÞ with respect to x: If, in turn, y 0 ¼ f 0ðxÞ is differentiated
with respect to x; another function y 00 ¼ f 00ðxÞ; called the second derivative of y or of f ðxÞ is obtained.
Similarly, a third derivative may be found, and so on.

Let y ¼ f ðxÞ ¼ x4  3x2 þ 8x þ 6: Then y 0 ¼ f 0ðxÞ ¼ 4x3  6x þ 8; y 00 ¼ f 00ðxÞ ¼ 12x2  6, and y 000 ¼

INCREASING AND DECREASING FUNCTIONS.
A function y ¼ fðxÞ is said to be an increasing
function if y increases as x increases, and a decreasing function if y decreases as x increases.
Let the graph of y ¼ fðxÞ be as shown in Fig. 47-1. Clearly y ¼ fðxÞ is an increasing function from A
to B and from C to D, and is a decreasing function from B to C and from D to E. At any point of the
curve between A and B (also, between C and D), the inclination y of the tangent line to the curve is acute;
hence, f 0ðxÞ ¼ tan y > 0. At any point of the curve between B and C (also, between D and E), the
inclination y of the tangent line is obtuse; hence, f 0ðxÞ ¼ tan y < 0.
Fig. 47-1
Thus, for values of x for which f 0ðxÞ > 0, the function fðxÞ is an increasing function; for values of x
for which f 0ðxÞ < 0, the function is a decreasing function.
When x ¼ b; x ¼ c, and x ¼ d, the function is neither increasing nor decreasing since f 0ðxÞ ¼ 0. Such
values of x are called critical values for the function fðxÞ.
EXAMPLE 1.
For the function fðxÞ ¼ x2  6x þ 8; f 0ðxÞ ¼ 2x  6.
Setting f 0ðxÞ ¼ 0, we ﬁnd the critical value x ¼ 3. Now f 0ðxÞ < 0 when x < 3, and f 0ðxÞ > 0 when x > 3.
Thus, fðxÞ ¼ x2  6x þ 8 is a decreasing function when x < 3 and an increasing function when x > 3. (See
Problem 47.1.)

RELATIVE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES.
Let the curve of Fig. 47-1 be traced from
left to right. Leaving A, the tracing point rises to B and then begins to fall. At B the ordinate fðbÞ
is greater than at any point of the curve near to B. We say that the point Bðb; fðbÞÞ is a relative
maximum point of the curve or that the function fðxÞ has a relative maximum ½¼ fðbÞ when x ¼ b.
By the same argument Dðd; fðd ÞÞ is also a relative maximum point of the curve or fðxÞ has a relative
maximum ½¼ fðd Þ when x ¼ d.
Leaving B, the tracing point falls to C and then begins to rise. At C the ordinate fðcÞ is smaller than
at any point of the curve near to C. We say that the point Cðc; fðcÞÞ is a relative minimum point of the
curve or that fðxÞ has a relative minimum ½¼ fðcÞ when x ¼ c.
Note that the relative maximum and minimum of this function occur at the critical values. While not
true for all functions, the above statement is true for all of the functions considered in this chapter.
Test for relative maximum.
If x ¼ a is a critical value for y ¼ fðxÞ and if f 0ðxÞ > 0 for all values
of x less than but near to x ¼ a while f 0ðxÞ < 0 for all values of x greater than but near to x ¼ a,
then fðaÞ is a relative maximum value of the function.
Test for relative minimum.
If x ¼ a is a critical value for y ¼ fðxÞ and if f 0ðxÞ < 0 for all values
of x less than but near to x ¼ a while f 0ðxÞ > 0 for all values of x greater than but near to x ¼ a,
then fðaÞ is a relative minimum value of the function.
If as x increase, in value through a critical value, x ¼ a; f 0ðxÞ does not change sign, then fðaÞ is
neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum value of the function.
EXAMPLE 2.
For the function of Example 1, the critical value is x ¼ 3.
Since f 0ðxÞ ¼ 2ðx  3Þ < 0 for x < 3 and f 0ðxÞ > 0 for x > 3, the given function has a relative minimum value
fð3Þ ¼ 1.
In geometric terms, the point ð3; 1Þ is a relative minimum point of the curve y ¼ x2  6x þ 8. (See
Problem 47.2.)
ANOTHER TEST FOR MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES.
At A on the curve of Fig. 47-1, the
inclination y of the tangent line is acute. As the tracing point moves from A to B, y decreases; thus
f 0ðxÞ ¼ tan y is a decreasing function. At B; f 0ðxÞ ¼ 0. As the tracing point moves from B to G, y is
obtuse and decreasing; thus f 0ðxÞ ¼ tan y is a decreasing function. Hence, from A to G; f 0ðxÞ is a
decreasing function and its derivative f 00ðxÞ < 0. In particular, f 00ðbÞ < 0. Similarly, f 00ðd Þ < 0.
As the tracing point moves from G to C; y is obtuse and increasing; thus f 0ðxÞ is an increasing
function. At C; f 0ðxÞ ¼ 0. As the tracing point moves from C to H; y is acute and increasing; thus f 0ðxÞ is
an increasing function. Hence, from G to H; f 0ðxÞ is an increasing function and f 00ðxÞ > 0. In particular,
f 00ðcÞ > 0.
Test for relative maximum.
If x ¼ a is a critical value for y ¼ fðxÞ and if f 00ðaÞ < 0, then fðaÞ is a
relative maximum value of the function fðxÞ.
Test for relative minimum.
If x ¼ a is a critical value for y ¼ fðxÞ and if f 00ðaÞ > 0, then fðaÞ is a
relative minimum value of the function fðxÞ.
The test fails when f 00ðaÞ ¼ 0. When this occurs, the tests of the preceding section must be used.
(See Problem 47.3.)
CONCAVITY.
Suppose that fðxÞ is a differentiable function on ða; bÞ. Then, if f 0ðxÞ is increasing on
ða; bÞ, we call f concave upward on ða; bÞ. See Fig. 47-2ðaÞ. If f 0ðxÞ is decreasing on ða; bÞ, we say f is
concave downward on ða; bÞ. See Fig. 47-2(b).

Fig. 47-2
INFLECTION POINT OF A CURVE.
If at x ¼ a, not necessarily a critical value for fðxÞ,
the concavity changes from downward to upward or upward to downward, ða; fðaÞÞ is an inﬂection point
of fðxÞ. See Fig. 47-3.
Fig. 47-3
In Fig. 47-1, G and H are inﬂection points of the curve. Note that at points between A and G the
tangent lines to the curve lie above the curve, at points between G and H the tangent lines lie below the
curve, and at points between H and E the tangent lines line above the curve. At G and H, the points of
inﬂection, the tangent line crosses the curve. Thus, f 00ðxÞ must be zero at an inﬂection point and change
sign there.

x ¼ 3; f 00ðxÞ > 0; hence f ð3Þ ¼ 1 is a relative minimum value. Since f 00ðxÞ ¼ 2 6¼ 0, the parabola y ¼ x2  6x þ 8 has
no inﬂection point. (See Problem 47.4.)

VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION.
Let a particle move along a horizontal line and let its distance
(in feet) at time t > 0 (in seconds) from a ﬁxed point O of the line be given by s ¼ fðtÞ. Let the positive
direction on the line be to the right (that is, the direction of increasing s). A complete description of the
motion may be obtained by examining fðtÞ; f 00ðtÞ, and f 00ðtÞ. It was noted in Chapter 45 that f 0ðtÞ gives the
velocity v of the particle. The acceleration of the particle is given by a a ¼ f 00ðtÞ.

of
Motion.
Here v ¼ f 0ðtÞ ¼ 3t2  12t þ 9 ¼ 3ðt  1Þðt  3Þ. When t ¼ 0; v ¼ f 0ð0Þ ¼ 9Þ; the particle
leaves A with initial velocity 9 ft/s.
Now v ¼ 0 when t ¼ 1 and t ¼ 3. Thus, the particle moves (from A) for 1 s, stops
momentarily (v ¼ 0, when t ¼ 1), moves off for two more seconds, stops momentarily,
and then moves off indeﬁnitely.
On the interval 0 < t < 1; v > 0. Now v > 0 indicates that s is increasing; thus the
body leaves A with initial velocity 9 ft/s and moves to the right for 1 s to B ½s ¼ fð1Þ ¼ 6
where it stops momentarily.
On the interval 1 < t < 3; v < 0. Now v < 0 indicates that s is decreasing; thus
the particle leaves B and moves to the left for 2 s to A½s ¼ fð3Þ ¼ 2 where it stops
momentarily.
On the interval t > 3; v > 0. The particle leaves A for the second time and moves
to the right indeﬁnitely.
Velocity and Speed.
We have a ¼ f 00ðtÞ ¼ 6t  12 ¼ 6ðt  2Þ. The acceleration is 0 when t ¼ 2.
On the interval 0 < t52; a < 0. Now a < 0 indicates that v is decreasing; thus the
particle moves for the ﬁrst 2 s with decreasing velocity. For the ﬁrst second (from A to B) the
velocity decreases from v ¼ 9 to v ¼ 0. The speed (numerical value of the velocity) decreases
from 9 to 0; that is, the particle ‘‘slows up.’’ When t ¼ 2; fðtÞ ¼ 4 (the particle is at C) and
f 0ðtÞ ¼ 3. Thus from B to Cðt ¼ 1 to t ¼ 2Þ, the velocity decreases from v ¼ 0 to v ¼ 3.
On the other hand, the speed increases from 0 to 3; that is, the particle ‘‘speeds up.’’
On the interval t > 2; a > 0; thus the velocity is increasing. From C to A ðt ¼ 2 to t ¼ 3Þ
the velocity increases from v ¼ 3 to v ¼ 0 while the speed decreases from 3 to 0. Thereafter
ðt > 3Þ both the velocity and speed increase indeﬁnitely. (See Problem 47.9.)
DIFFERENTIALS.
Let y ¼ fðxÞ. Deﬁne dx (read, differential x) by the relation dx ¼ Dx and deﬁne dy
(read, differential y) by the relation dy ¼ f 0ðxÞ · dx. Note dy 6¼ Dy.
EXAMPLE 6.
If y ¼ fðxÞ ¼ x3, then
Dy ¼ ðx þ DxÞ3  x3 ¼ 3x2 · Dx þ 3xðDxÞ2 þ ðDxÞ3 ¼ 3x2 · dx þ 3xðdxÞ2 þ ðdxÞ3
while dy ¼ f 0ðxÞ · dx ¼ 3x2 · dx. Thus, if dx is small numerically, dy is a fairly good approximation of Dy and simple
to compute.
Suppose now that x ¼ 10 and dx ¼ Dx ¼ :01. Then for the function above, Dy ¼ 3ð10Þ2ð:01Þ þ 3ð10Þð:01Þ2þ
ð:01Þ3 ¼ 3:0031 while dy ¼ 3ð10Þ2ð:01Þ ¼ 3.

Here f 0ðxÞ ¼ 2ðx  4Þ. Setting this equal to 0 and solving, we ﬁnd the critical value to be x ¼ 4. We
locate the point x ¼ 4 on the x axis and ﬁnd that f 0ðxÞ < 0 for x < 4, and f 0ðxÞ > 0 when x > 4. See Fig.

f 0ðxÞ ¼ 3ðx  2Þ2; the critical value is x ¼ 2. See Fig. 47-8. Then fðxÞ is an increasing function on the

(b)
The critical values are x ¼ 2 and x ¼ 2. Since f 0ðxÞ > 0 for x < 2 and f 0ðxÞ < 0 for 2 < x < 2, the
function has a relative maximum value fð2Þ ¼ 37. Since f 0ðxÞ < 0 for 2 < x < 2 and f 0ðxÞ > 0 for
x > 2, the function has a relative minimum value fð2Þ ¼ 27.
(c)
The critical values are x ¼ 1 and x ¼ 3. Since f 0ðxÞ < 0 for x < 1 and f 0ðxÞ > 0 for 1 < x < 3, fðxÞ
has a relative minimum value fð1Þ ¼ 0. Since f 0ðxÞ > 0 for 1 < x < 3 and f 0ðxÞ < 0 for x > 3, the
function has a relative maximum value fð3Þ ¼ 32.
(d ) The function has neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum value.
(e)
The critical value is x ¼ 2. Since f 0ðxÞ > 0 for x < 2 and f 0ðxÞ > 0 for x > 2, the function has neither a

Find the relative maximum and minimum values of the functions of Problem 47.1, using the second
derivative test.
(a)
fðxÞ ¼ x2  8x; f 0ðxÞ ¼ 2x  8; f 00ðxÞ ¼ 2.
The critical value is x ¼ 4. Since f 00ð4Þ ¼ 2 6¼ 0; fð4Þ ¼ 16 is a relative minimum value of the
function.
(b)
fðxÞ ¼ 2x3  24x þ 5; f 0ðxÞ ¼ 6x2  24; f 00ðxÞ ¼ 12x.
The critical values are x ¼ 2 and x ¼ 2. Since f 00ð2Þ ¼ 24 < 0; fð2Þ ¼ 37 is a relative maximum
value of the function; since f 00ð2Þ ¼ 24 > 0; fð2Þ ¼ 27 is a relative minimum value.
(c)
fðxÞ ¼ x3 þ 3x2 þ 9x þ 5; f 0ðxÞ ¼ 3x2 þ 6x þ 9; f 00ðxÞ ¼ 6x þ 6.
The critical values are x ¼ 1 and x ¼ 3. Since f 00ð1Þ > 0; fð1Þ ¼ 0 is a relative minimum value of
the function; since f 00ð3Þ < 0; fð3Þ ¼ 32 is a relative maximum value.
(d ) fðxÞ ¼ x3 þ 3x; f 0ðxÞ ¼ 3x2 þ 3; f 00ðxÞ ¼ 6x.
There are no critical values; hence the function has neither a relative minimum nor a relative

fðxÞ ¼ ðx  2Þ3; f 0ðxÞ ¼ 3ðx  2Þ2; f 00ðxÞ ¼ 6ðx  2Þ.

The critical value are x ¼ 1 and x ¼ 7

IF FðxÞ IS A FUNCTION whose derivative F 0ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ, then FðxÞ is called an antiderivative of f ðxÞ.
For example, FðxÞ ¼ x3 is an antiderivative of f ðxÞ ¼ 3x2 since F 0ðxÞ ¼ 3x2 ¼ f ðxÞ. Also, GðxÞ ¼
x3 þ 5 and HðxÞ ¼ x3  6 are antiderivatives of f ðxÞ ¼ 3x2. Why?
If FðxÞ and GðxÞ are two distinct antiderivatives of f ðxÞ, then FðxÞ ¼ GðxÞ þ C, where C is a constant.
(See Problem 48.1)
THE INDEFINITE INTEGRAL OF f ðxÞ is denoted by
Z
f ðxÞ dx, and is the most general antiderivative
of f ðxÞ—that is
Z
f ðxÞ dx ¼ FðxÞ þ C
where FðxÞ is any function such that F 0ðxÞ ¼ f ðxÞ and C is an arbitrary constant. Thus the indeﬁnite
integral of f ðxÞ ¼ 3x2 is
Z

AREA BY SUMMATION.
Consider the area A bounded by curve y ¼ f ðxÞ $ 0, the x axis, and the
ordinates x ¼ a and x ¼ b, where b > a.
Let the interval a # x # b be divided into n equal parts each of length Dx. At each point of
subdivision, construct the ordinate, thus dividing the area into n strips, as in Fig. 48-1. Since the areas of
the strips are unknown, we propose to approximate each strip by a rectangle whose area can be found. In
Fig. 48-2, a representative strip and its approximating rectangle are shown.
Fig. 48-1
Fig. 48-2
Suppose the representative strip is the ith strip counting from the left, and let x ¼ xi be the
coordinate of the midpoint of its base. Denote by yi ¼ fðxiÞ the ordinate of the point Pi (on the curve)
whose abscissa is xi. Through Pi pass a line parallel to the x axis and complete the rectangle MRSN. This
rectangle of area yiDx is the approximating rectangle of the ith strip. When each strip is treated similarly,
it seems reasonable to take
y1Dx þ y2Dx þ y3Dx þ · · · þ ynDx ¼ S
n
i¼1 yiDx
as an approximation of the area sought.
Now suppose that the number of strips (with approximating rectangles) is indeﬁnitely increased so
that Dx ! 0. It is evident from the ﬁgure that by so increasing the number of approximating rectangles
the sum of their areas more nearly approximates the area sought; that is,

At every point ðx; yÞ of a certain curve, the slope is equal to 8 times the abscissa. Find the equation of the
curve if it passes through (1,3).
Since m ¼ dy
dx ¼ 8x, we have dy ¼ 8x dx. Then y ¼ R 8x dx ¼ 4x2 þ C, a family of parabolas. We seek
the equation of the parabola of this family which passes through the point (1,3). Then 3 ¼ 4ð1Þ2 þ C and
C ¼ 1. The curve has equation y ¼ 4x2  1.
48.4
For a certain curve y 00 ¼ 6x  10. Find its equation if it passes through point (1,1) with slope 1.
Since y 00 ¼ 6x  10, y 0 ¼ 3x2  10x þ C1; since y 0 ¼ 1 when x ¼ 1, we have 1 ¼ 3  10 þ C1 and
C1 ¼ 6. Then y 0 ¼ 3x2  10x þ 6.
Now y ¼ x3  5x2 þ 6x þ C2 and since y ¼ 1 when x ¼ 1, 1 ¼ 1  5 þ 6 þ C2 and C2 ¼ 1. Thus the
equation of the curve is y ¼ x3  5x2 þ 6x  1.

The velocity at time t of a particle moving along the x axis is given by v ¼ x 0 ¼ 2t þ 5. Find the position of
the particle at time t, if x ¼ 2 when t ¼ 0.
Select a point on the x axis as origin and assume positive direction to the right. Then at the beginning of
the motion ðt ¼ 0Þ the particle is 2 units to the right of the origin.
Since v ¼ dx
dt ¼ 2t þ 5; dx ¼ ð2t þ 5Þ dt. Then x ¼ Rð2t þ 5Þ dt ¼ t2 þ 5t þ C.
Substituting x ¼ 2 and t ¼ 0, we have 2 ¼ 0 þ 0 þ C so that C ¼ 2. Thus the position of the particle at
time t is given by x ¼ t2 þ 5t þ 2.

A body moving in a straight line has an acceleration equal to 6t2, where time (t) is measured in seconds and
distance s is measured in feet. If the body starts from rest, how far will it move during the ﬁrst 2 s?
Let the body start from the origin; then it is given that when t ¼ 0, v ¼ 0 and s ¼ 0.
Since a ¼ dv
dt ¼ 6t2; dv ¼ 6t2dt. Then v R 6t2dt ¼ 2t3 þ C1. When t ¼ 0, v ¼ 0; then 0 ¼ 2 · 0 þ C1 and
C1 ¼ 0. Thus v ¼ 2t3.
Now v ¼ ds

A ball is thrown upward from the top of a building 320 ft high with initial velocity 128 ft/s. Determine the

First we choose an origin from which all distances are to be measured and a direction (upward or
downward) which will be called positive.

INTEGRATION
373

First Solution.
Take the origin at the top of the building and positive direction as upward.
Then
a ¼ dv
dt ¼ 32
and
v ¼ 32t þ C1
When the ball is released, t ¼ 0 and v ¼ 128; then 128 ¼ 32ð0Þ þ C1 and C1 ¼ 128.
Now v ¼ ds=dt ¼ 32t þ 128 and s ¼ 16t2 þ 128t þ C2. When the ball is
released, t ¼ 0 and s ¼ 0; then C2 ¼ 0 and s ¼ 16t2 þ 128t.
When the ball strikes the street, it is 320 ft below the origin, that is, s ¼ 320;
hence, 320 ¼ 16t2 þ 128t, t2  8t  20 ¼ ðt þ 2Þðt  10Þ ¼ 0, and t ¼ 10. Finally,
when t ¼ 10, v ¼ 32ð10Þ þ 128 ¼ 129 ft/s.
Second Solution.
Take the origin on the street and positive direction as before. Then a ¼ dv=dt ¼ 32
and v ¼ 32t þ 128 as in the ﬁrst solution.
Now s ¼ 16t2 þ 128t þ C2 but when t ¼ 0, s ¼ 320. Thus C2 ¼ 320 and
s ¼ 16t2 þ 128 þ 320. When the ball strikes the street s ¼ 0; then t ¼ 10 and v ¼
192 ft/s as before.

(c) the speed of the ball when it struck the ground.
Assume the origin at the point where the ball strikes the ground and positive distance to be directed
upward. Then
a ¼ dv
dt ¼ 32
and
v ¼ 32t þ C1
When t ¼ 0, v ¼ 48; hence, C1 ¼ 48. Then v ¼ ds=dt ¼ 32 þ 48 and s ¼ 16t2 þ 48t þ C2.
When t ¼ 0, s ¼ 640; hence, C2 ¼ 640 and s ¼ 16t2 þ 48t þ 640.

Inﬁnite Sequences
GENERAL TERM OF A SEQUENCE.
Frequently the law of formation of a given sequence may be
stated by giving a representative or general term of the sequence. This general term is a function of n,
where n is the number of the term in the sequence. For this reason, it is also called the nth term of the
sequence.
When the general term is given, it is a simple matter to write as many terms of the sequence as desired.
EXAMPLE 1
(a)
Write the ﬁrst four terms and the tenth term of the sequence whose general term is 1=n.
The ﬁrst term ðn ¼ 1Þ is 1
1 ¼ 1, the second term ðn ¼ 2Þ is 1
2, and so on.The ﬁrst four terms are 1, 1
2, 1
3, 1
4 and
the tenth term is 1
10.
(b)
Write the ﬁrst terms and the ninth term of the sequence whose general term is ð1Þ n1
2n
n2 þ 1.
The ﬁrst term ðn ¼ 1Þ is ð1Þ11 2 · 1
12 þ 1 ¼ 1, the second term ðn ¼ 2Þ is ð1Þ1 2 · 2
22 þ 1 ¼  4
5, and so on.
The ﬁrst four terms are 1,  4
5, 3
5,  8
17 and the ninth term is ð1Þ8 2 · 9
92 þ 1 ¼ 9
41.
Note that the effect of the factor ð1Þ n1 is to produce a sequence whose terms have alternate signs, the sign
of the ﬁrst term being positive. The same pattern of signs is also produced by the factor ð1Þ nþ1. In order to
produce a sequence whose terms alternate in sign, the ﬁrst term being negative, the factor ð1Þ n is used.
When the ﬁrst few terms of a sequence are given and they match an obvious pattern, the general
term is obtained by inspection.
EXAMPLE 2.
Obtain the general term for each of the sequences:
(a)
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . . .
The terms of the sequence are the squares of the positive integers; the general term is n2.
(b)
3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, . . . .
This is an arithmetic progression having a ¼ 3 and d ¼ 4. The general term is a þ ðn  1Þd ¼ 4n  1. Note,
however, that the general term can be obtained about as easily by inspection.
(See Problems 49.1–49.3.)

and we infer that, by proceeding far enough along in this sequence, the difference between the terms of
the sequence and 2 may be made as small as we please. This is equivalent to the following: Let e denote a
positive number, as small as we please; then there is a term of the sequence such that the difference
between it and 2 is less than e, and the same is true for all subsequent terms of the sequence. For
example, let e ¼ 1=1025 then the difference between the term 2 þ 1=1026 and 2, 2 þ 1=1026  2 ¼ 1=1026,
is less then e ¼ 1=1025 and the same is true for the terms 2 þ 1=1027, 2 þ 1=1028, and so on.
The behavior of the terms of the sequence (49.1) discussed above is indicated by the statement:
The limit of the sequence (49.1) is 2. In general, if, for an inﬁnite sequence
s1, s2, s3, . . . , sn, . . .
ð49:2Þ
and a positive number e, however small, there exists a number s and a positive integer m such that for
all n > m
js  snj < e,
then the limit of the sequence is s.
EXAMPLE 3.
Show, using the above deﬁnition, that the limit of sequence (49.1) is 2.
Take e ¼ 1=10 p, where p is a positive integer as large as we please; thus, e is a positive number as small as we
please. We must produce a positive integer m (in other words, a term sm) such that for n > m (that is, for all
subsequent terms) js  snj < e. Now

The statement that the limit of the sequence (49.2) is s describes the behavior of sn as n increases
without bound over the positive integers. Since we shall repeatedly be using the phrase ‘‘as n increases
without bound’’ or the phrase ‘‘as n becomes inﬁnite,’’ which we shall take to be equivalent to the former
phrase, we shall introduce the notation n ! 1 for it. Thus the behavior of sn may be described brieﬂy by
lim

or, in words, if each of two sequences approaches a limit, then the limits of the sum, difference, product,
and quotient of the two sequences are equal, respectively, to the sum, difference, product, and quotient
of their limits provided only that, in the case of the quotient, the limit of the denominator is not zero.
This theorem makes it possible to ﬁnd the limit of a sequence directly from its general term. In this
connection, we shall need

THE FOLLOWING THEOREMS are useful in establishing whether or not certain sequences have
a limit.
I.
Suppose M is a ﬁxed number, such that for all values of n,
sn # snþ1
and
sn # M;
then lim
n!1 sn exists and is #M.
If, however, sn eventually exceeds M, no matter how large M may be, lim
n!1 sn does not exist.
II.
Suppose M is a ﬁxed number such that, for all values of n,
sn $ snþ1
and
sn $ M;
then lim
n!1 sn exists and is $M.
If, however, sn is eventually smaller than M, no matter how small M may be, lim
n!1 sn does not exist.

For the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, . . . , 2n þ 1 , . . . , sn < snþ1 but sn will eventually exceed any chosen M, however
large (if M ¼ 21000 þ 1, then 2n þ 1 > M for n > 2999), and the sequences does not have a limit.

RECURSIVELY DEFINED SEQUENCES.
Sequences can be deﬁned recursively. For example,
suppose that a1 ¼ 1 and anþ1 ¼ 2an for every natural number n. Then,
a1 ¼ 1,
a2 ¼ a1þ1 ¼ 2a1 ¼ 2,
a3 ¼ a2þ1 ¼ 2a2 ¼ 4,
etc.
Thus, the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . .
One famous such sequence is the Fibonacci sequence:
a1 ¼ 1,
a2 ¼ 1,
anþ2 ¼ anþ1 þ an:
The sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . . .

Inﬁnite Series
THE INDICATED SUM of the terms of an inﬁnite sequence is called an inﬁnite series. Let
s1 þ s2 þ s3 þ · · · þ sn þ · · ·
ð50:1Þ
be such a series and deﬁne the sequence of partial sums
S1 ¼ s1;
S2 ¼ s1 þ s2;
. . . ;
Sn ¼ s1; þs2 þ · · · þ sn;
. . .
If lim
n!1 Sn exists, the series (50.1) is called convergent; if lim
n!1 Sn ¼ S, the series is said to converge to S.
If lim
n!1 Sn does not exist, the series is called divergent.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) Every inﬁnite geometric series
a þ ar þ ar2 þ · · · þ arn1 þ · · ·
is convergent if jrj < 1 and is divergent if jrj $ 1. (See Problem 50.1.)
(b) The harmonic series 1 þ 1
2 þ 1
2 þ · · · þ 1=n þ · · · is divergent. (See Problem 49.9 and Problem 50.2.)
A NECESSARY CONDITION THAT (50.1) BE CONVERGENT is lim
n!1 sn ¼ 0; that is, if (50.1) is
convergent then lim
n!1 sn ¼ 0: However, the condition is not sufﬁcient since the harmonic series is divergent
although lim
n!1 sn ¼ lim
n!1ð1=nÞ ¼ 0:
A SUFFICIENT CONDITION THAT (50.1) BE DIVERGENT is lim
n!1 sn 6¼ 0; that is, if lim
n!1 sn exists and
is different from 0, or if lim
n!1 sn does not exist, the series is divergent. This, in turn, is not a necessary
condition since the harmonic series is divergent although lim
n!1 sn ¼ 0. (See Problem 50.3).
SERIES OF POSITIVE TERMS
COMPARISON TEST FOR CONVERGENCE of a series of positive terms.
I.
If every term of a given series of positive terms is less than or equal to the corresponding term of
a known convergent series from some point on in the series, the given series is convergent.
II.
If every term of a given series of positive terms is equal to or greater than the corresponding
term of a known divergent series from some point on in the series, the given series is divergent.

The following series will be found useful in making comparison tests:
(a)
The geometric series a þ ar þ ar2 þ · · · þ arn þ · · · which converges when jrj < 1 and
diverges when jrj $ 1
(b)
The p series 1 þ 1
2p þ 1
3p þ · · · þ 1
np þ · · · which converges for p > 1 and diverges for p # 1
(c)
Each new series tested
In comparing two series, it is not sufﬁcient to examine the ﬁrst few terms of each series. The
general terms must be compared, since the comparison must be shown from some point on. (See
Problems 50.4–50.6.)
THE RATIO TEST FOR CONVERGENCE.
If, in a series of positive terms, the test ratio
rn ¼ snþ1
sn
approaches a limit R as n ! 1, the series is convergent if R < 1 and is divergent if R > 1. If R ¼ 1; the
test fails to indicate convergency or divergency. (See Problem 50.7.)
SERIES WITH NEGATIVE TERMS
A SERIES WITH ALL ITS TERMS NEGATIVE may be treated as the negative of a series with all of
its terms positive.
ALTERNATING SERIES.
A series whose terms are alternately positive and negative, as
s1  s2 þ s3  · · · þ ð1Þn1sn þ · · ·
ð50:2Þ
where each s is positive, is called an alternating series.
An alternating series (50.2 ) is convergent provided sn $ snþ1, for every value of n, and lim
n ! 1 sn ¼ 0.
(See Problem 50.8.)
ABSOLUTELY CONVERGENT SERIES.
A series (50.1 ), s1 þ s2 þ s3 þ · · · þ sn þ · · · in which
some of the terms are positive and some are negative is called absolutely convergent if the series of
absolute values of the terms
js1j þ js2j þ js3j þ · · · þ jsnj þ · · ·
ð50:3Þ
is convergent.
CONDITIONALLY CONVERGENT SERIES.
A series (50.1 ), where some of the terms are positive
and some are negative, is called conditionally convergent if it is convergent but the series of absolute
values of its terms is divergent.
EXAMPLE 2.
The series 1  1
2 þ 1
3  1
4 þ · · · is convergent, but the series of absolute values of its terms
1 þ 1
2 þ 1
3 þ 1
4 þ · · · is divergent. Thus, the given series is conditionally convergent.
THE GENERALIZED RATIO TEST.
Let (50.1 ) s1 þ s2 þ s3 þ · · · þ sn þ · · · be a series some of
whose terms are positive and some are negative. Let
lim
n!1

INFINITE SERIES

The series (50.1 ) is absolutely convergent if R < 1 and is divergent if R > 1. If R ¼ 1, the test fails.

and
c0 þ c1ðx  aÞ þ c2ðx  aÞ2 þ · · · þ cn  1ðx  aÞ n  1 þ · · ·;
ð51:2Þ
where a; c0; c1; c2; . . . are constants, are called power series. The ﬁrst is called a power series in x and the
second a power series in ðx  aÞ.
The power series (51.1) converges for x ¼ 0 and (51.2) converges for x ¼ a. Both series may
converge for other values of x but not necessarily for every ﬁnite value of x. Our problem is to ﬁnd for a
given power series all values of x for which the series converges. In ﬁnding this set of values, called the
interval of convergence of the series, the generalized ratio test of Chapter 50 will be used.
EXAMPLE 1.
Find the interval of convergence of the series
x þ x2=2 þ x3=3 þ · · ·
Since
jsnj ¼ xn

n þ 1 · n
xn

 ¼ lim
n ! 1
n
n þ 1 x

 ¼ jxj:
Then, by the ratio test, the given series is convergent for all values of x such that jxj < 1, that is, for
1 < x < 1; the series is divergent for all values of x such that jxj > 1, that is, for x < 1 and x > 1; and
the test fails for x ¼ 61.
But, when x ¼ 1 the series is 1 þ 1
2 þ 1
3 þ 1
4 þ · · · and is divergent, and when x ¼ 1 the series is
1 þ 1
2  1
3 þ 1
4  · · · and is convergent.
Thus, the series converges on the interval 1 # x < 1. This interval may be represented graphically
as in Fig. 51-1. The solid line represents the interval on which the series converges, the thin lines the
intervals on which the series diverges. The solid circle represents the end point for which the series
converges, the open circle the end point at which the series diverges. (See Problems 51.1–51.8.)

Polar Coordinates
IN THE POLAR COORDINATE SYSTEM a point in the plane is located by giving its position relative
to a ﬁxed point and a ﬁxed line (direction) through the ﬁxed point. The ﬁxed point O (see Fig. 52-1) is
called the pole and the ﬁxed half line OA is called the polar axis.
Let y denote the smallest positive angle measured counterclockwise in degrees or radians from OA to
OB, and let r denote the (positively) directed distance OP. Then P is uniquely determined when r and y
are known. These two measures constitute the polar coordinates of P and we write Pðr; yÞ. The quantity r
is called the radius vector and y is called the vectorial angle of P. Note that a positive direction, indicated
by the arrow, has been assigned on the half line OB
$$!.

EXAMPLE 1.
Locate the point Pð3; 240–Þ or Pð3; 4p=3Þ. Refer to Fig. 52-2.
Lay off the vectorial angle y ¼ m]AOB ¼ 240–, measured counterclockwise from OA
$$!, and on OB
$$! locate P
such that r ¼ OP ¼ 3.
In the paragraph above we have restricted r and y so that r $ 0 and 0– # y < 360–. In general, these
restrictions will be observed; however, at times it will be more convenient to permit r and y to have
positive or negative values. If y is negative and r is positive, we lay off the angle y ¼ —AOB, measured
clockwise from OA
$$!, and locate P on OB
$$! so that OP ¼ r. If r is negative, we lay off y ¼ —AOB, extend
OB
$$! through the pole to B0, and locate P on OB0
$$! a distance jrj from O.
EXAMPLE 2.
Locate the point Pð2; 60–Þ or Pð2; p =3Þ. Refer to Fig. 52-3.
Lay off the vectorial angle y ¼ —AOB ¼ 60–, measured clockwise from OA, extend OB through the pole to B0,
and on OB 0 locate P a distance 2 units from O. (See Problems 52.1–52.2.)

Although not a part of the polar system, it will be helpful at times to make use of a half line, called
the 90– axis, which issues from the pole perpendicular to the polar axis.
TRANSFORMATIONS BETWEEN POLAR AND RECTANGULAR COORDINATES.
If the pole
and polar axis of the polar system coincide respectively with the origin and positive x axis of the
rectangular system, and if P has rectangular coordinates ðx; yÞ and polar coordinates ðr; yÞ, then the
following relations hold:
(1)
x ¼ r cos y
(4)
y ¼ arctan y=x
(2)
y ¼ r sin y
(5)
sin y ¼ y=r and cos y ¼ x=r
(3)
r ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
x2 þ y2

If relations (3)–(5) are to yield the restricted set of coordinates of the section above, y is to be taken as
the smallest positive angle satisfying (5) or, what is equivalent, y is the smallest positive angle satisfying
(4) and terminating in the quadrant in which Pðx; yÞ lies.
EXAMPLE 3.
Find the rectangular coordinates of Pð3; 300–Þ.

and
y ¼ 300–;

EXAMPLE 4.
Find the polar equation of the circle whose rectangular equation is x2 þ y2  8x þ 6y  2 ¼ 0.
Since x ¼ r cos y; y ¼ r sin y, and x2 þ y2 ¼ r2, the polar equation is r2  8r cos y þ 6r sin y  2 ¼ 0. (See
Problems 52.3–52.5.)
CURVE SKETCHING IN POLAR COORDINATES.
Preliminary to sketching the locus of a polar
equation, we discuss symmetry, extent, etc., as in the case of rectangular equations. However, there are
certain complications at times due to the fact that in polar coordinates a given curve may have more than
one equation.
EXAMPLE 5.
Let Pðr; yÞ be an arbitrary point on the curve r ¼ 4 cos y  2. Now P has other representations:
ðr; y þ pÞ; ðr; y  pÞ; ðr; y  2pÞ; . . . .
Since ðr; yÞ satisﬁes the equation r ¼ 4 cos y  2; ðr; y þ pÞ satisﬁes the equation r ¼ 4 cos ðy þ pÞ  2 ¼
4 cos y  2 or r ¼ 4 cos y þ 2. Thus, r ¼ 4 cos y  2 and r ¼ 4 cos y þ 2 are equations of the same curve. Such
equations are called equivalent. The reader will show that ðr; y  pÞ satisﬁes r ¼ 4 cos y þ 2 and ðr; y  2pÞ satisﬁes
r ¼ 4 cos y  2.
EXAMPLE 6.
Show that point Að1; p=6Þ is on the ellipse r ¼
3
4 þ 2 siny.
Note that the given coordinates do not satisfy the given equation.
First Solution.
Another set of coordinates for A is ð1; 7p=6Þ. Since these coordinates satisfy the
equation, A is on the ellipse.
Second Solution.
An equivalent equation for the ellipse is
r ¼
3
4 þ 2 sin ðy  pÞ
or
r ¼
3
4  2 sin y
Since the given coordinates satisfy this equation, A is on the ellipse.

SYMMETRY.
A locus is symmetric with respect to the polar axis if an equivalent equation is obtained
when
(a)
y is replaced by y, or
(b)
y is replaced by p  y and r by r in the given equation.
A locus is symmetric with respect to the 90– axis if an equivalent equation is obtained when
(a)
y is replaced by p  y, or
(b)
y is replaced by y and r by r in the given equation.
A locus is symmetric with respect to the pole if an equivalent equation is obtained when
(a)
y is replaced by p þ y, or
(b)
r is replaced by r in the given equation.
EXTENT.
The locus whose polar equation is r ¼ fðyÞ is a closed curve if r is real and ﬁnite for all
values of y, but is not a closed curve if there are values of one variable which make the
other become inﬁnite.
The equation should also be examined for values of one variable which make the other
imaginary.
At times, as in the equation r ¼ a ð1 þ sin yÞ, the values of y which give r its maximum
values can be readily determined. Since the maximum value of sin y is 1, the maximum value
of r is 2a which it assumes when y ¼ 1
2 p.
DIRECTIONS AT THE POLE.
Unlike all other points, the pole has inﬁnitely many pairs of coordinates
ð0; yÞ when y is restricted to 0– # y < 360–. While two such pairs ð0; y1Þ
and ð0; y2Þ deﬁne the pole, they indicate different directions (measured
from the polar axis) there. Thus, the values of y for which r ¼ fðyÞ ¼ 0
give the directions of the tangents to the locus r ¼ fðyÞ at the pole.
POINTS ON THE LOCUS.
We may ﬁnd as many points on a locus as desired by assigning values to y
in the given equation and solving for the corresponding values of r.
EXAMPLE 7.
Discuss and sketch the locus of the cardioid r ¼ að1  sin yÞ.
Symmetry.
An equivalent equation is obtained when y is replaced by p  y; the locus is symmetric with respect to
the 90– axis.
Extent.
Since r is real and #2a for all values of y, the locus is a closed curve, lying within a circle of radius 2a with
center at the pole. Since sin y is of period 2p, the complete locus is described as y varies from 0 to 2p.
Direction at the pole.
When r ¼ 0; sin y ¼ 1 and y ¼ 1
2 p. Thus, the locus is tangent to the 90– axis at the pole.
After locating the points in Table 52.1 and making use of symmetry of the locus with respect to the 90– axis, we
obtain the required curve as shown in Fig. 52-4. (See Problems 52.11–52.17.)

INTERSECTIONS OF POLAR CURVES.
It is to be expected that in ﬁnding the points of
intersection of two curves with polar equations r ¼ f1ðyÞ and r ¼ f2ðyÞ, we set f1ðyÞ ¼ f2ðyÞ and solve for
y. However, because of the multiplicity of representations both of the coordinates of a point and the
equation of a curve, this procedure will fail at times to account for all of the intersections. Thus, it is a
better policy to determine from a ﬁgure the exact number of intersections before attempting to ﬁnd them.
EXAMPLE 8.
Since each of the circles r ¼ 2 sin y and r ¼ 2 cos y passes through the pole, the circles intersect in the
pole and in one other point. See Fig. 52-5. Since each locus is completely described on the interval 0 to p, we set
2 sin y ¼ 2 cos y and solve for y on this interval. The solution y ¼ 1
4 p yields the point ð
ﬃﬃ
2
p
; 1
4 pÞ.
Fig. 52-5
Analytically we may determine whether or not the pole is a point of intersection by setting r ¼ 0 in each of the
equations and solving for y. Setting sin y ¼ 0 we ﬁnd y ¼ 0, and setting cos y ¼ 0 we ﬁnd y ¼ 1
2 p. Since both equations
have solutions, the pole is a point of intersection. The procedure above did not yield this solution since the coordinates
of the pole ð0; 0Þ satisfy r ¼ 2 sin y while the coordinates ð0; 1
2 pÞ satisfy r ¼ 2 cos y. (See Problems 52.18–52.19.)

The following special cases are of interest:

If the center is at the pole, (1) becomes r2 ¼ a2. Then r ¼ a or r ¼ a is the equation of the circle of
radius a with center at the pole.
(b)
If ðc; gÞ ¼ ð6a; 0–Þ, (1) becomes r ¼ 62a cos y. Thus, r ¼ 2a cos y is the equation of the circle of
radius a passing through the pole and having its center on the polar axis; r ¼ 2a cos y is the
equation of the circle of radius a passing through the pole and having its center on the polar axis
extended.

Introduction to the
Graphing Calculator
IN THIS TEXT, a number of opportunities to utilize calculators have been provided to the reader. In many of these
cases, a traditional handheld calculator would be sufﬁcient. However, handheld algebraic-entry graphing calculators
have become quite prevalent, and although some of the applications of such calculators are well above the level of

the mathematics in this book, it would be worthwhile to introduce these devices at this point. The goal here is to
make you familiar with such calculators and to make you at ease with them. In that way, when you engage in more
advanced mathematics such as the calculus, it will be easier for you to use graphing calculators.
First, what does such a calculator look like? An example is indicated in Fig. A1-1. This diagram illustrates the
keyboard of the Hewlett-Packard HP 38G calculator.
While there are other such calculators available to you on the market, I have found that this particular one
offers the easiest retrieval of answers and meshes particularly well with the needs of the mathematics student at both
the precalculus level and more advanced levels as well. In this appendix, you will be presented with a brief overview
of the calculator and of its use in solving equations and graphing functions.
You turn the calculator on by pressing the O N key. Note that the O N key is also the C A N C E L key. Also, if
you wish to lighten or darken your calculator’s screen, simply hold down the O N key while you press the  or þ
keys. (Note: Please refer to the Reference Manual provided with the HP 38G for a more detailed description of the
many uses of the calculator.)
The HOME screen is the main area in which you will work. Press H O M E to ﬁnd this area. Note that the
H O M E screen is divided into two main parts: The large rectangular area is the space in which entries and answers
are indicated; the smaller rectangular area is the Editline. For example, if you press the keystrokes

then you will ﬁnd the following on the HOME screen:

If you press the keystrokes

then you will ﬁnd the following on the H O M E screen:
Notice that the HP 36G uses algebraic-entry notation. Thus, to perform a calculation, you ﬁrst press the
operations required, and then press E N T E R. Again, if you wish to ﬁnd 689 – 231, press the keystrokes

The HP 38G can be used to solve simple equations and to graph elementary functions. Let’s look at some
examples. Please refer to the HP 38G Reference Manual for more detailed instructions.
Let us solve the equation X  2 ¼ 9. At any one of the equation lines (marked E1, E2, etc.), enter the equation
X  2 ¼ 9. Note that ‘‘X’’ is entered by pressing the A...Z key, and then pressing the  key. Also note that the ‘‘=’’
sign is entered by pressing the key under the ‘‘=’’ sign on the lower, darkened area of the screen. After the equation
appears correctly, press E N T E R. A check mark should appear next to the equation you have entered. This check
mark indicates that when you attempt to solve, the equation checked is the one you will be solving. Next, press the
N U M key, and then the key under the word ‘‘SOLVE’’ in the lower, darkened area of the screen. The number 11
should appear next to the symbol X.
Now try to solve the equation 2X  11 ¼ 13 using the HP 38G and the following series of steps. Press L I B, use
the arrow keys to scroll to Solve, press E N T E R, go to any of the ‘‘E’’ lines, and enter the equation 2X  11 ¼ 13.
Press E N T E R. Press the key under the pC H K box on the lower, darkened area of the screen. Press the N U M key
and then press the key under the word SOLVE in the lower, darkened area of the screen. You should see the answer
12 appear next to the symbol X.
Next, solve each of the following using the HP 38G or similar graphing calculator:
1.
2X  15 ¼ 26
2.
3X ¼ 4X þ 4
3.
5Y ¼ 6Y þ 12:5
Let’s now investigate the graph of the equation Y ¼ X  4. Press the L I B key, and use the arrow keys to locate
‘‘FUNCTION.’’ Press E N T E R, and at any one of the ‘‘F’’ lines, enter the expression X  4. Make certain that you
press E N T E R. Note that you may enter the ‘‘X’’ by pressing the key under the symbol X in the lower, darkened
area of the screen. Make certain that the equation you have entered is ‘‘checked,’’ and then press the P L O T key.
The graph of the line will appear on a set of coordinate axes. Consult the Reference Manual for more details
concerning the use of the HP 38G for graphing purposes.
Now try to graph the equation Y ¼ 2X  11 using the HP 38G and the following series of steps. Press L I B, use
the arrow keys to scroll to Function, and press E N T E R. Go to any of the ‘‘F’’ lines, and enter 2X  11. Press
E N T E R. Make certain that the expression is ‘‘checked’’ and that no other expressions are ‘‘checked.’’ All
expressions checked will be plotted when you press P L O T. Now press P L O T. The graph will appear on the
coordinate axes on the calculator’s screen.
Now graph each of the following using the HP 38G or similar calculator:
1.
Y ¼ 2X  5
2.
Y ¼ 5X ¼ 13
3.
2Y ¼ 3X  7

ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS is concerned mainly with certain elements called numbers and with certain
operations deﬁned on them.
The unending set of symbols 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; . . . used in counting are called natural numbers.
In adding two of these numbers, say, 5 and 7, we begin with 5 (or with 7) and count to the right seven (or ﬁve)
numbers to get 12. The sum of two natural numbers is a natural number; that is, the sum of two members of the
above set is a member of the set.
In subtracting 5 from 7, we begin with 7 and count to the left ﬁve numbers to 2. It is clear, however, that 7
cannot be subtracted from 5, since there are only four numbers to the left of 5.
INTEGERS.
In order that subtraction be always possible, it is necessary to increase our set of numbers. We preﬁx
each natural number with a þ sign (in practice, it is more convenient not to write the sign) to form the positive
integers, we preﬁx each natural number with a  sign (the sign must always be written) to form the negative integers,
and we create a new symbol 0, read zero. On the set of integers
. . . ; 8; 7; 6; 5; 4; 3; 2; 1; 0; þ1; þ2; þ3; þ4; þ5; þ6; þ7; þ8; . . .
the operations of addition and subtraction are possible without exception.
To add two integers such as þ7 and 5, we begin with þ7 and count to the left (indicated by the sign of 5) ﬁve
numbers to þ2, or we begin with 5 and count to the right (indicated by the sign of þ7) seven numbers to þ2. How
would you add 7 and 5 ?
To subtract þ7 from 5, we begin with 5 and count to the left (opposite to the direction indicated by þ7) seven
numbers to 12. To subtract 5 from þ7 we begin with þ7 and count to the right (opposite to the direction
indicated by 5) ﬁve numbers to þ12. How would you subtract þ7 from þ5? 7 from 5? 5 from 7 ?
If one is to operate easily with integers, it is necessary to avoid the process of counting. To do this, we memorize
an addition table and establish certain rules of procedure. We note that each of the numbers þ7 and 7 is seven steps
from 0 and indicate this fact by saying that the numerical value of each of the numbers þ7 and 7 is 7. We may state:
Rule 1.
To add two numbers having like signs, add their numerical values and preﬁx their common sign.
Rule 2.
To add two numbers having unlike signs, subtract the smaller numerical value from the larger, and preﬁx the
sign of the number having the larger numerical value.
Rule 3.
To subtract a number, change its sign and add.
Since 3 · 2 ¼ 2 þ 2 þ 2 ¼ 3 þ 3 ¼ 6, we assume
ðþ3Þ ðþ2Þ ¼ þ6
ð3Þ ðþ2Þ ¼ ðþ3Þ ð2Þ ¼ 6 and ð3Þ ð2Þ ¼ þ6

Rule 4.
To multiply or divide two numbers (never divide by 0 !), multiply or divide the numerical values, preﬁxing a
þ sign if the two numbers have like signs and a  sign if the two numbers have unlike signs.
If m and n are integers, then m þ n, m  n, and m · n are integers but m 4 n may do not be an integer. (Common
fractions will be treated in the next section.) Moreover, there exists a unique integer x such that m þ x ¼ n. If x ¼ 0,
then m ¼ n; if x is positive (x > 0), then m is less than nðm < nÞ; if x is negative ðx < 0Þ, then m is greater than
nðm > nÞ.
The integers may be made to correspond one-to-one with equally spaced points on a straight line as in Fig. A2-
1. Then m > n indicates that the point on the scale corresponding to m lies to the right of the point corresponding to
n. There will be no possibility of confusion if we write the point m rather than the point which corresponds to m, and
we shall do so hereafter. Then m < n indicates that the point m lies to the left of n.
Fig. A2-1
Every positive integer m is divisible by 61 and 6m. A positive integer m > 1 is called a prime if its only factors
or divisors are 61 and 6m; otherwise, m is called composite. For example, 2, 7, 19 are primes, while
6 ¼ 2 · 3; 18 ¼ 2 · 3 · 3, and 30 ¼ 2 · 3 · 5 are composites. In these examples, the composite numbers have been
expressed as products of prime factors, that is, factors which are prime numbers. Clearly, if m ¼ r · s · t· is such a
factorization of m, then m ¼ ð1Þ r · s · t is such a factorization of m.
THE RATIONAL NUMBERS.
The set of rational numbers consists of all numbers of the form m=n, where m and
n 6¼ 0 are integers. Thus, the rational numbers include the integers and common fractions.
Every rational number has an inﬁnitude of representations; for example, the integer 1 may be represented by
1=1; 2=2; 3=3; 4=4 . . . and the fraction 2=3 may be represented by 4=6; 6=9; 8=12; . . .. A fraction is said to be expressed
in lowest terms by the representation m=n, where m and n have no common prime factor. The most useful rule
concerning rational numbers is, therefore:
Rule 5.
The value of a rational number is unchanged if both the numerator and denominator are multiplied or
divided by the same nonzero number.
Caution:
We use Rule 5 with division to reduce a fraction to lowest terms. For example, we write 15=21 ¼
3=3 · 5=7 ¼ 5=7 and speak of canceling the 3s. Now canceling is not an operation on numbers. We cancel or strike out
the 3s as a safety measure, that is, to be sure that they will not be used in computing the ﬁnal result. The operation is
division and Rule 5 states that we may divide the numerator by 3 provided we also divide the denominator by 3. This
point is belabored here because of the all too common error:
12a  5
7a
The fact is the 12a  5
7a
cannot be further simpliﬁed for if we divide 7a by a we must also divide 12a and 5 by a. This
would lead to the more cumbersome
12  5=a
7
The rational numbers may be associated in a one-to-one manner with points on a straight line as in Fig. A2-2.
Here the point associated with the rational number m is m units from the point (called the origin) associated with 0,
the distance between the points 0 and 1 being the unit of measure.
Fig. A2-2
APPENDIX B]
THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA
415

If two rational numbers have representations r=n and s=n, where n is a positive integer, then r=n > s=n if r > s,
and r=n < s=n if r < s. Thus, in comparing two rational numbers it is necessary to express them with the same
denominator. Of the many denominators (positive integers) there is always a least one, called the least common
denominator. For the fractions 3=5 and 2=3, the least common denominator is 15. We conclude that 3=5 < 2=3 since
3=5 ¼ 9=15 < 10=15 ¼ 2=3.
Rule 6.
The sum (difference) of two rational numbers expressed with the same denominator is a rational number
whose denominator is the common denominator and whose numerator is the sum (difference) of the
numerators.
Rule 7.
The product of two or more rational numbers is a rational number whose numerator is the product of the
numerators and whose denominator is the product of the denominators of the several factors.
Rule 8.
The quotient of two rational numbers can be evaluated by the use of Rule 5 with the least common
denominator of the two numbers as the multiplier.
If a and b are rational numbers, a þ b, a  b, and a · b are rational numbers. Moreover, if a and b are 6¼0, there
exists a rational number x, unique except for its representation, such that
ax ¼ b
ðA2:1Þ
When a or b or both are zero, we have the following situations:
b ¼ 0 and a 6¼ 0:
ðA2:1Þ becomes a · x ¼ 0 and x ¼ 0; that is; 0=a ¼ 0 when a 6¼ 0:
a ¼ 0 and b 6¼ 0:
ðA2:1Þ becomes 0 · x ¼ b; then b=0; when b 6¼ 0, is without meaning since 0 · x ¼ 0:
a ¼ 0 and b ¼ 0:
ðA2:1Þ becomes 0 · x ¼ 0; then 0/0 is indeterminate since every number x satisfies
the equation:
In brief: 0=a ¼ 0 when a 6¼ 0, but division by 0 is never permitted.
DECIMALS.
In writing numbers we use a positional system, that is, the value given any particular digit depends
upon its position in the sequence. For example, in 423 the positional value of the digit 4 is 4 (100), while in 234 the
positional value of the digit 4 is 4 (1). Since the positional value of a digit involves the number 10, this system of
notation is called the decimal system. In this system, the number 4238.75 means
4ð1000Þ þ 2ð100Þ þ 3ð10Þþ 8ð1Þ þ 7ð1=10Þ þ 5ð1=100Þ
It is interesting to note that from this example certain deﬁnitions to be made in a later study of exponents
may
be
anticipated.
Since
1000 ¼ 103; 100 ¼ 102; 10 ¼ 101,
it
would
seem
natural
to
deﬁne
1 ¼ 100;
1=10 ¼ 101; 1=100 ¼ 102.
By
the
process
of
division,
any
rational
number
can
be
expressed
as
a
decimal;
for
example,
70=33 ¼ 2:121212 . . .. This is termed a repeating decimal, since the digits 12, called the cycle, are repeated without
end. It will be seen later that every repeating decimal represents a rational number.
In operating with decimals, it may be necessary to ‘‘round off ’’ a decimal representation to a prescribed number
of decimal places. For example, 1=3 ¼ 0:3333 . . . is written as 0.33 to two decimal places and 2=3 ¼ 0:6666 . . . is
written as 0.667 to three decimal places. In rounding off, use will be made of the Computer’s Rule:
(a)
Increase the last digit retained by 1 if the digits rejected exceed the sequence 50000 . . .. For example,
2:384629 . . . becomes 2.385 to three decimal places.
(b)
Leave the last digit retained unchanged if the digits rejected are less than 5000 . . .. For example,
2:384629 . . . becomes 2.38 to two decimal places.
(c)
Make the last digit retained even if the digit rejected is exactly 5; for example, to three decimal places
11.3865 becomes 11.386 and 9.3815 becomes 9.382.
PERCENTAGE.
The
symbol
%,
read
percent,
means
per
hundred;
thus;
5%
is
equivalent
to
5/
100 or 0.05.
[APPENDIX B
416
THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA

Any number, when expressed in decimal notation, can be written as a percent by multiplying by 100 and adding
the symbol %. For example, 0:0125 ¼ 100ð0:0125Þ% ¼ 1:25% ¼ 11
4 %; and 7=20 ¼ 0:35 ¼ 35%.
Conversely, any percentage may be expressed in decimal form by dropping the symbol % and dividing by 100.
For example, 42:5% ¼ 42:5=100 ¼ 0:425; 3:25% ¼ 0:0325, and 2000% ¼ 20.
When using percentages, express the percent as a decimal and, when possible, as a simple fraction. For example,
4 1
4 % of 48 ¼ 0:0425 · 48 ¼ 2:04 and 12 1
2 % of 5:28 ¼ 1=8 of 5:28 ¼ 0:66. (See Problems.)
THE IRRATIONAL NUMBERS.
The existence of numbers other than the rational numbers may be inferred
from either of the following considerations:
(a)
We may conceive of a nonrepeating decimal constructed in endless time by setting down a succession of
digits chosen at random.
(b)
The length of the diagonal of a square of side 1 is not a rational number; that is, there exists no rational
number a such that a2 ¼ 2. Numbers such as
ﬃﬃ
2
p
;
ﬃﬃ
2
3p
;
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
3
5p
, and p (but not
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
3
p
or
ﬃﬃ
5
4p
) are called irrational
numbers. The ﬁrst three of these are called radicals. The radical
ﬃﬃa
np is said to be of order n; n is called the
index, and a is called the radicand.
THE REAL NUMBERS.
The set of real numbers consists of the rational and irrational numbers. The real
numbers may be ordered by comparing their decimal representations. For example,
ﬃﬃ
2
p
¼ 1:4142 . . .; then
7=5 ¼ 1:4 <
ﬃﬃ
2
p
; 3=2 ¼ 1:5 >
ﬃﬃ
2
p
, etc.
We assume that the totality of real numbers may be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the totality of
points on a straight line. See Fig. A2-3.
Fig. A2-3
The number associated with a point on the line, called the coordinate of the point, gives its distance and
direction from the point (called the origin) associated with the number 0. If a point A has coordinate a, we shall
speak of it as the point AðaÞ.
The directed distance from point AðaÞ to point BðbÞ on the real number scale is given by AB ¼ b  a. The
midpoint of the segment AB has coordinate 1
2 ða þ bÞ.
THE COMPLEX NUMBERS.
In the set of real numbers there is no number whose square is 1. If there is to be
such a number, say,
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1
p
, then by deﬁnition ð
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1
p
Þ2 ¼ 1. Note carefully that ð

p

If a > 0;
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a

p ;
i2 ¼ 1
Then

Numbers of the form a þ bi, where a and b are real numbers, are called complex numbers. In the complex
number a þ bi, a is called the real part and bi is called the imaginary part. Numbers of the form ci, where c is real, are
called imaginary numbers or sometimes pure imaginary numbers.
The complex number a þ bi is a real number when b ¼ 0 and a pure imaginary number when a ¼ 0.
Only the following operations will be considered here:

To add (subtract) two complex numbers, add (subtract) the real parts and add (subtract) the pure imaginary
parts; that is, ða þ ibÞ þ ðc þ idÞ ¼ ða þ bÞ þ ðb þ dÞi.
To multiply two complex numbers, form the product treating i as an ordinary number and then replace i2
by 1; that is, ða þ ibÞðc þ idÞ ¼ ðac  bdÞ þ ðbc þ adÞi.

Mathematical
Modeling
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES
in the precalculus curriculum over the last 10 years is the
introduction into that curriculum of mathematical modeling. Certainly it is the case that problems and problem
solving have been a signiﬁcant part of that curriculum. How is modeling different?
According to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics’ publication, Mathematical Modeling in the
Secondary School Curriculum, a mathematical model is ‘‘. . . a mathematical structure that approximates the features
of phenomenon. The process of devising a mathematical model is called mathematical modeling.’’ (Swetz and
Hartzler, NCTM, Reston, Virginia 1991.) Thus, one can see that mathematical modeling does not in any way replace
problem solving in the curriculum. Instead, it is a kind of problem solving.
EXAMPLE.
One of the most signiﬁcant applications of modeling in mathematics is in the area of population growth. Table A3.1
gives the population for a culture of bacteria from time t ¼ 0 until t ¼ 5 s.

See Fig. A3-1 for the graph of these data with x axis representing t and y axis representing p.
Notice that for the times from 0 to 2, the graph in Fig. A3-1 is linear. In fact, it is approximately linear through
t ¼ 4. Let us ﬁnd the equation of the line that approximates these data: Since the data contain the points ð1; 1Þ and
ð2; 2Þ, a reasonable model for these data is the equation y ¼ x. This equation, y ¼ x, or, in function form,
pðxÞ ¼ x
is a linear model. We can use this linear model to predict the population of this community.

For example, pðxÞ ¼ x predicts that
pð3Þ ¼ 3:
Since pð3Þ ¼ 4, our model is off by 25%. PðxÞ ¼ x predicts that
pð4Þ ¼ 4
but pð4Þ ¼ 5, so the model is off by 20%.
The reader should ask herself/himself whether the quadratic model
pðxÞ ¼ x2
2
is a better model for these data. For example, what is the percent error for t ¼ 2; 3; 4, etc.? What do these two models
predict in terms of growth for various larger values of t? If the population at time 10 is 35, which is the better model?
Using the example above, we see that the critical steps in modeling are as follows:
ðaÞ
Conjecture what model best ﬁts the data given (or observed).
ðbÞ
Analyze the model mathematically.
ðcÞ
Draw reasonable conclusions based on the analysis in ðbÞ.
In the example above, we
ðaÞ
Conjectured that a linear model provided a reasonable ﬁt for given data.
ðbÞ
Conjectured a model and analyzed it mathematically.
ðcÞ
Drew conclusions which included testing an additional model.
