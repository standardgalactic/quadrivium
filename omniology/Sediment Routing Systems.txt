SEDIMENT ROUTING SYSTEMS
This cutting-edge summary combines ideas from several sub-disciplines, including
geology, geomorphology, oceanography and geochemistry, to provide an integrated view
of Earth surface dynamics in terms of sediment generation, transport and deposition.
Introducing a global view of fundamental concepts underpinning source-to-sink studies,
it provides an analysis of the component segments which make up sediment routing
systems. The functioning of sediment routing systems is illustrated through calculations
of denudation and sedimentation as well as the response to external drivers; with the ﬁnal
sections focusing on the stratigraphic record of sediment routing systems. Containing
quantitative solutions to a wide range of problems in Earth surface dynamics, this book is
suitable for graduate students as well as academic and professional researchers.

In this new book, Philip Allen has distilled a lifetime of insightful study of the Earth’s
surface into a wide ranging and rigorous synthesis of planetary sediment processes.
Sediment Routing Systems is the ﬁrst to use the idea of global sediment routing – ‘following
the sediment’ – to provide a framework for synthesis across environments and scales, to
integrate the source and sink sides of the routing system, and to link geochemical and
particulate ﬂuxes. It manages to do this in a quantitative framework that is carefully
formulated, accessible, and perfectly pitched in clarity and detail. Sediment Routing
Systems is a landmark and masterpiece; for many Earth scientists, it will be all they need
in terms of global sediment dynamics.

If reading the sedimentary record is the destination, then this book is a brilliant companion
for the road, ranging widely from bedload to organic carbon and providing thorough detail
on processes and methods at every turn. Philip Allen turns the sediment routing system
from Pandora’s box into a dynamic source-to-sink cascade.

Sediment Routing Systems is the ﬁrst complete, quantitative process-based account of
sediment generation, transport and deposition in book format. In true style, ahead of
anyone else, Philip Allen gives an extremely thorough, comprehensive view of all process
aspects of source-to-sink systems. This book combines theoretical with practical aspects
and will be an obvious choice as an advanced text book in universities and as a key
reference book for professional geologists dealing with energy and Earth systems.

Preface
By far the most powerful way to ﬁnd out about Earth’s history is to study the sediments
and sedimentary rocks comprising the stratigraphic record. With this in mind, Doyle and
Bennett (1998) stated conﬁdently that
Stratigraphy is the key to understand the Earth, its materials, structure and past life. It encompasses
everything that has happened in the history of the planet.
Chris Paola (www.esci.umn.edu/people/chris-paola) observed lyrically and cautiously
Rachel Carson wrote that ‘The sediments are a sort of epic poem of the Earth’. Unfortunately this
poem is written in a language we don’t understand.
Part of this lack of understanding of the language of the epic poem of the Earth has its
origins in the imperfect recording of events in the stratigraphic record, and particularly in
the difﬁculty of deciphering what the English poet Tennyson (1809–1892) called the ‘long
result of Time’, since the familiar processes responsible for the liberation, transport and
deposition of sediment are best known at the very short timescales of human observation.
As James Hutton wrote (1785),
it is not in human record, but in natural history, that we are to look for the means of ascertaining what
has already been.
The other part of our lack of understanding derives from the difﬁculty of seeing the big
picture with all of its feedbacks and linkages, which allows us to effectively ‘join the dots’
(Allen, 2014) (ch.1). This big, integrated picture is that of the sediment routing system.
Sediment routing systems are the dynamical systems that link the fate of sediment from
source to sink and integrate the processes taking place at or near the surface of the Earth,
and the resultant depositional products, at the timescales relevant to the understanding of
stratigraphy. They involve a ‘cascade’ of sediment from primarily erosional source areas to
depositional sinks, and therefore are responsible for upland landscapes and their sediment
and solute efﬂuxes, transport across the continental surface and delivery to the ocean, and
dispersal into long-term depositional sites in the deep sea. The processes acting in sediment
routing systems therefore shape erosional and depositional landscapes and extract sediment
to build stratigraphy, the primary archive of the ‘epic poem of the Earth’.

Preface
Sediment routing systems are important from the point of view of basin analysis, land-
scape evolution and the building of the stratigraphic record. They are also the context for
understanding impacts of climate change and human activities on the environment. These
impacts might include landscape sensitivity, ecological changes to rivers, restoration, soil
loss and landslides in upland terrains, siltation of reservoirs, hazards and risk, starvation and
compaction of river delta regions, as well as management of future water resources. Study
of sediment routing systems is an integral part of a ‘uniﬁed science of the Earth’s surface’
(Paola et al., 2006) (p.W03S10), as expressed in the research agenda of the National Center
for Earth-Surface Dynamics, an NSF Science and Technology Center headquartered at St
Anthony Falls Laboratory, University of Minnesota. In addition, I am conﬁdent that sedi-
ment routing system-type thinking will form the basis for a next generation of stratigraphic
analysis, with profound implications for subsurface exploration and production. Source-to-
Sink (S2S) methodologies are increasingly used in the hydrocarbon sector.
The scientiﬁc community has recognised the importance of joined-up thinking on
the dynamics of the thin surface skin of the planet. The CSDMS (Community Surface
Dynamics Modeling System) is building a community model for the quantitative prediction
of material ﬂuxes from source to sink (see http://csdms.colorado.edu/w/images/CSDMS_
lecture7.pdf). A white paper on ‘Building a Community Surface Dynamics Modeling
System’ is found at www.nsf-margins.org/S2S/S2SWhitePaper.pdf. CSDMS states that it
‘will be a community-built and freely available suite of integrated, ever-improving software
modules predicting the transport and accumulation of sediment and solutes in landscapes
and sedimentary basins over a broad range of time and space scales’.
The same inclusive view of Earth surface dynamics was the motivation for a topical
session at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting in San Francisco in 2001
entitled ‘Source to Sink: Production, Transport and Accumulation of Sediment with a
Special Focus on Climate Signals and Impacts’. Papers originating at this meeting were
later published as a set in Sedimentary Geology in 2003 edited by Steven Goodbred and
Steve Kuehl. Several papers stressed the role of climate change in forcing trends in sediment
discharge and continental margin evolution in contrasting regions from alluvial plains to the
deep sea.
Integrated source-to-sink research programmes have been supported by a number of
national and transnational funding agencies. The National Science Foundation (NSF)
MARGINS initiative recognised that a predictive capability for sediment dispersal system
behaviour has critical implications for understanding geochemical cycling, ecosystem
change and resource management (www.nsf-margins.org/S2S/S2S.html). The MARGINS
initiative sponsored the AGU Chapman Conference in 2011 (24–27 January), entitled
‘Source-to-Sink Systems around the World and through Time: Recent Advances in
Understanding Production, Transfer and Burial of Terrestrial and Marine Materials on
the Earth Surface’, at Oxnard, California, convened by Charles Nittrouer and Steven
Kuehl. The programme is at http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Chapman_Source_to_Sink.
The European margin strata formation (EuroSTRATAFORM) programme was
funded under the 5th Framework Programme of the European Union for 2002–2005.

EuroSTRATAFORM set out to study marine sediment dispersal from source to sink on
contrasted European margins, with the aim of understanding how geological strata are
generated. Investigations were carried out at a variety of timescales in order to bridge the
gap between currently active processes and the geological record. EuroSTRATAFORM
participants contributed to special issues of the journals Marine Geology and Oceanog-
raphy. The guest editors of the Oceanography special issue, published in 2004, James P.
M. Syvitski, Philip P. E. Weaver, Serge Berné, Charles A. Nittrouer, Fabio Trincardi and
Miguel Canals, stated that the ﬁve goals of EuroSTRATAFORM were
(1) To evaluate the inﬂuences on continental-margin sediment ﬂux, including the characteristics
of sediment sources and their temporal variability due to climatic evolution and human impacts.
(2) To understand the oceanic processes that erode, transport and deposit sediment in the margin
system, including short-term (i.e., hours to weeks) processes that produce event beds and the longer-
term variability (e.g., seasonal, interannual) of those processes. (3) To quantify the physical and
biological processes responsible for post-depositional modiﬁcation of strata. (4) To understand the
creation of the preserved stratigraphic architecture and sedimentary facies on continental margins
as the product of processes acting with spatial and temporal heterogeneities. (5) To explore the
nested expression of sedimentary successions, including the geologic identities of seismic properties,
sequence boundaries, and intervening sequences.
The European Geosciences Union (EGU) sponsored conference sessions on ‘Tectonics,
Sedimentation and Surface Processes’ in 2012, 2013 and 2014. A special issue of the
journal Earth Surface Processes and Landforms collects a number of papers presented
in these conference sessions, fronted by a commentary that highlighted three active chal-
lenges (Castelltort, Whittaker, and Verges, 2015). These challenges are to make progress in
answering the questions of how tectonic and climatic drivers are recognised in landscapes;
how signals, such as pulses in sediment discharge, are propagated through sediment routing
‘systems’ with different internal dynamics; and how the coupled processes of tectonics
and surface processes are best modelled. Another thematic set, entitled ‘Source-to-Sink
Systems: Sediment and Solute Transfer on the Earth Surface’, was published in Earth
Science Reviews in 2015, edited by John Walsh, Patricia Wiberg and Rolf Aalto.
Considerable attention has been paid to the delivery of sediment to deltas. Continually
updated information can be found at the Global River and Delta Systems SourcetoSink
Information Center, which uses a Google map on an open platform, coded and edited by
Paul Liu of North Carolina State University (www.meas.ncsu.edu/sealevel/s2s/).
In Part I of this book, sediment routing systems are introduced from a global perspective,
starting with a broad view of how sediment routing systems function from source to sink.
Whereas the terrestrial segments of sediment routing systems are relatively easy to map,
since they correspond primarily to river drainage basins, the submarine segments are more
elusive to constrain. Part I concludes with a global perspective on the role of the sediment
routing system in biogeochemical cycling of the Earth. The controls on the chemistry
of river water and the fate of particulate organic carbon carried by rivers to the ocean
emphasise the important role of bedrock geology and sediment dynamics in mediating
ocean chemistry and global climate.

Preface
Part II delves more deeply into the main segments that make up sediment routing
systems, comprising the catchment-ﬂuvial segment, separated from the continental shelf
segment by the highly dynamic coastal zone, and the deep marine segment. In each
segment, the controlling factors behind erosion, sediment transport and deposition are
considered, principally using well-documented examples from the present day, or with the
temporal perspective of the time since the last glaciation (104 yr).
Part III turns attention to how sediment routing systems function dynamically, with an
emphasis on their sediment ﬂuxes and budgets. Fluxes and budgets are best explored in
a mass balance framework. An indicator of system dynamics is the migration of ‘moving
boundaries’ such as the gravel front or the coast. Sediment moves intermittently during its
cascade through the sediment routing system, so that the sediment transit time is largely
governed by the time spent in temporary storage. The ‘conveyor’ or ‘capacitor’ proper-
ties of sediment routing systems determine the way in which such systems respond to a
perturbation in the processes driving sediment ﬂux. Signals may be transmitted quickly
and without signiﬁcant modiﬁcation, or may be propagated as modiﬁed signals, or may
be lost or ‘shredded’ by strong interaction with the system’s internal dynamics. Sedi-
ment routing systems are mediated or driven by tectonics, which control rock uplift in
source regions and accommodation generation in depositional basins. Tectonic processes
operate at a range of scales from individual faults to linked extensional and contractional
arrays, to ﬂexural downwarps and the changing dynamic topography caused by mantle
circulation.
Part IV of the book concerns the sedimentary archive of sediment routing systems.
The formation of sediment by weathering is the start of a chain of dispersal processes
leading to long-term deposition. Source and sink can be connected in a number of pos-
sible ways using provenance tools. Petrographic, compositional and isotopic information,
heavy mineral analysis, palaeocurrents and U-Pb geochronology allow, in combination, an
identiﬁcation of sediment source areas. Sediment is transformed and fractionated from the
site of weathering to eventual deposition in terms of composition and grain size. Tectonic
processes and climate change have a fundamental impact on the down-system ﬁning of
grain size. Part IV concludes with a review of the signiﬁcance of the sediment routing
system approach for the interpretation of sequence stratigraphic architectures. Source-to-
sink studies of the Quaternary are particularly informative of how depositional architectures
and ﬂuxes respond to changes in climate, sea level and sediment dynamics. Taking the
integrated approach of sediment routing systems emphasises that stratigraphic architectures
are generally non-unique, or non-diagnostic, in terms of forcing mechanisms, with the pre-
cise roles of autocyclicity, sea level change, climate, sediment supply and accommodation
generation difﬁcult to disentangle. As a result, the compilation of a global sea level chart
from a stratigraphic database is problematical.
In summary, in this book I highlight the emergence of sediment routing systems as a
compelling new way to understand Earth surface dynamics and as a tool to understand
Earth history through the archive of stratigraphy. The book is not intended as a synthesis of

Sediment Routing Systems: First Concepts
1.1 How Sediment Routing Systems Function
Sediment routing systems link the fate of particulate sediment from source to sink, and
essentially frame the problems of denudation, sediment transport and deposition as a box
model characterised by sources, reservoirs and sinks with connecting ﬂuxes (Figure 1.1).
Sediment routing systems, or denudation-accumulation systems (Einsele, Ratschbacher,
and Wetzel, 1996; Hinderer and Einsele, 2001), are integrated, dynamical systems con-
necting regions of erosion, sediment transfer, temporary storage and long-term deposition
(Meade, 1972, 1982; Schumm, 1977; Castelltort and Van Den Driessche, 2003; Allen and
Allen, 2013; Romans and Graham, 2013; Sadler and Jerolmack, 2015). They involve a sed-
iment cascade (Burt and Allison, 2010) from single or multiple source regions to long-term
depositional sinks via a series of geomorphic environments characterised by intermittent
storage (Section 1.2). The sediment routing system philosophy therefore ﬁrmly places geo-
morphology, sedimentology and stratigraphy within an Earth system context, but also forms
the framework for allied investigations of, for example, global biogeochemical cycles.
Sediment routing systems represent a vigorous way in which the Earth recycles mass,
and their dynamics are fundamental to global responses to, for example, supercontinental
assembly and dispersal, mountain building and climate change (Whipple, 2009). They
also provide thoroughfares for the transmission of chemical signals from mountains to the
ocean (Meybeck, 1987; Hay, 1998; Galy et al., 2007). Sediment routing systems therefore
participate strongly in many geochemical cycles, such as that of carbon (Leithold, Blair,
and Wegmann, 2015), including in the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 mediated by rates of
chemical weathering (Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992), in the delivery of particulate organic
carbon to the ocean and its removal from the short-term carbon cycle by rapid burial
in deltas and sediment fans (France-Lanord and Derry, 1997; Galy et al., 2007), in the
charging of coastal waters with nutrients (Orive, Elliott, and de Jong, 2002) and in the
catalysing of ocean anoxia in sheltered and semi-enclosed seas by changes in freshwater
discharge of rivers (Beckmann et al., 2005).
The concept of sediment routing systems was not until recently part of mainstream geo-
logical thinking, despite the fact that sediment provenance, based on sediment mineralogy
(Boswell, 1933; Pettijohn, Potter, and Siever, 1987), bulk composition (Dickinson and

may be cannibalised and enter the transport system again, and continental and marine reservoirs may
be reworked as a result of base-level change. (b) The same sediment routing system as a network,

Suczek, 1979) and palaeocurrents (Potter and Pettijohn, 1977), has been studied system-
atically for many years. The linkage between source and sink can be made by forward
modelling the cascade of sediment (Section 1.2) from erosional landscapes primarily in
terms of volumes and ﬂuxes, but also in terms of sediment composition and grain size
(Johnsson, 1993; Weltje and von Eynatten, 2004), and inversely by reconstructing source
area characteristics from detrital mineralogy, thermochronology and geochronology.
Sediment dynamics in sediment routing systems is rarely smooth, continuous and unin-
terrupted like a relentless conveyor belt. Instead, the release of particulate sediment and
dissolved solids from erosional source regions is neither uniform nor steady. These efﬂuxes

tend to be transient in relation to the forcing mechanisms. Some systems may respond
quickly and linearly to a perturbation, in which case they can be termed ‘reactive’ (Allen,
2008a). Other systems may be sluggish to respond, and the signal may be transformed
markedly during down-system propagation. Large alluvial systems have the ability to buffer
incoming signals, which smooths out their amplitude and wavelength (Castelltort and Van
Den Driessche, 2003; Allen, 2008a; Romans et al., 2015). The passage of signals through
sediment routing systems therefore depends on the internal dynamics of sediment routing
system segments and the ‘transfer zones’, ‘transition zones’ or ‘energy fences’ between
them (Carvajal and Steel, 2009), some signals being effectively lost, or ‘shredded’, during
transmission (Jerolmack and Paola, 2010). Sediment dynamics and hydrodynamics com-
monly change markedly at these transition zones, as takes place for example between river
systems and the shoreface.
It is the passage of signals through the sediment routing system that causes different
parts to be ‘teleconnected’. Most commonly, signals are communicated down-system, so
that, for instance, a climate change in an erosional source region passes down to the ocean in
the form of a change in particulate sediment discharge. Alternatively, a base-level change at
a river mouth, for example caused by global sea level fall, passes up-system as an erosional
wave that generates enhanced erosion rates in the source region. In this way, the entire
sediment routing system is dynamically connected.
Buffering of signals is caused by the interruption of sediment transport by periods of
intermittent storage (Malmon, Dunne, and Reneau, 2003; Allen, 2008b), which causes an
increase in transit time for a grain-size population. As Philip Allen 2008a (p.274) put it:
One can imagine tracking the trajectory of a single grain of sand from its source in mountain head-
waters to its sink in a river ﬂood plain, delta or the deep sea. Each grain would have a different
trajectory and a different time in transit. The integration of a multiplicity of such trajectories deﬁnes
a sediment-routing system, and an integration of the different transit times, were it possible, would
provide information on the ability of the routing system to buffer incoming sediment ﬂux signals.
The release of sediment from source regions carries a ﬁngerprint that is potentially
recognisable in basin stratigraphy in terms of mass ﬂuxes, grain-size characteristics and
sediment composition (Ibbeken and Schleyer, 1991, 2003). In a simple catchment-fan sys-
tem, for example, where there is a single bedrock lithology such as granite, there will be lit-
tle temporal change in sediment composition but a lateral compositional gradient caused by
the hydraulic sorting of the different mineral components of the source region lithology. In
such a case, particular diagnostic minerals, or index minerals, used in thermochronometric
and cosmogenic dating, can be unambiguously connected to their hinterland source. Most
basin-ﬁlls, however, are derived from multiple sources (Vezzoli, Garzanti, and Monguzzi,
2004; Weltje and Brommer, 2011) consisting of a range of bedrock lithologies, which
induces a lateral (spatial) and vertical (temporal) variation in sediment composition in basin
stratigraphy. The heterogeneous distribution of lithologies in the hinterland combined with
the complexities of unrooﬁng history produce a mixing structure in basin stratigraphy that
is challenging to decipher. Speciﬁcally, the clast compositions of proximal conglomerates

have been used to monitor the progressive erosion of source regions in tectonically active
hinterlands (Graham et al., 1986; DeCelles, 1988). Complex mixing structures in basin
stratigraphy make it more difﬁcult to relate diagnostic minerals to their source region.
If stratigraphic units in the basin can be linked to source area lithologies, then the relative
contribution of different source terrains can be assessed and sediment budgets estimated for
the time span of interest. However, basin sediments may be recycled from older stratigra-
phy, chemical sediments must be accounted for, basin stratigraphy must be corrected to
porosity-free solid volumes, and catchments serving as source areas for sediments must
be correctly identiﬁed and delineated. Present-day sediment routing systems commonly
beneﬁt from the presence of well-deﬁned and quantitatively characterised catchment areas
but may suffer from a poor database on stratigraphy buried beneath the basin surface.
Ancient sediment routing systems may have a well-known stratigraphy but source area
parameters may be unknown or speculative. In some cases, the history of drainage evolution
and sediment supply to adjacent basins can be evaluated on a continental scale (Simoes,
Braun, and Bonnet, 2010). For example, the changing total sediment input to the Gulf
of Mexico Basin over the Cenozoic (since 65 Ma) has been calculated from the supply
from 8 ﬂuvial axes draining a high proportion of the North American continental surface
(Galloway, Whiteaker, and Ganey-Curry, 2011) (Figure 1.2). Peaks in sediment delivery,
evaluated from depositional volumes, of 150 × 103 km3 Myr−1 occurred in the Palaeocene
and Pleistocene. The Mississippi River delivers the bulk of the sediment entering the Gulf
of Mexico at the present day. The modern TDS (total dissolved solids) of 400 Mt yr−1,
equivalent to 150 km3 Myr−1, is in agreement with the long-term value derived from
the volumes of depositional episodes in the Gulf of Mexico Basin. In well-constrained
examples, sediment volumes may be inverted to obtain mean catchment erosion rates over
geological timescales that can be compared with estimates derived from thermochronomet-
ric methods (Rouby et al., 2009; Carvajal and Steel, 2012; Michael et al., 2014b).
A major goal within the broader remit of sediment routing systems research is to gain
predictive capability of subsurface compositional and granulometric trends. Harnessing
such capability would be highly beneﬁcial to the understanding of the ﬂow of ﬂuids through
the porous media represented by basin sediments, with applications to hydrocarbon pro-
duction, contaminant ﬂuxes in groundwater and drawdown of aquifers as well as to basin
analysis. Yet it is problematical to sample subsurface stratigraphy at the resolution required
to build a reliable database. To make progress demands more than an inversion of ﬁeld
observations. A holistic analytical approach was proposed by Heins and Kairo (2007) in
which all of the factors controlling sand composition and texture were analysed together,
chief of which are tectonics, geomorphology, lithological make-up of the source region,
weathering and transport processes. These factors are constrained by quantitative input
on source region lithologies, the regional topographic gradient, climate (weathering and
transport potential), transport distance in the source catchment and in the depositional
basin, basin subsidence rate and depositional facies (Heins and Kairo, 2007).

extent of its footprint, or ‘fairway’ (Michael, Whittaker, and Allen, 2013; Michael et al.,

be made between hinterland erosion and basin ﬁlling, and also potentially explain the down-
stream evolution of sedimentary facies, stratigraphic architectures and the partitioning of
grain size (Cross and Lessinger, 1998; Granjeon and Joseph, 1999) (Figure 1.3). Sediment
is fractionated by particle size during transport (Cross and Lessinger, 1998), principally
by selective extraction from surface ﬂuxes to build stratigraphy (Strong et al., 2005; Allen,
2008a; Paola and Martin, 2012; Michael et al., 2013), producing a down-system trend in
the relative proportions of grain-size classes and in the mean grain size of gravel and sand
(Fedele and Paola, 2007; Duller et al., 2010; Whittaker et al., 2011; Parsons et al., 2012;

Figure 1.3 Sediment dispersal and deposition in a sediment routing system. Sediment is discharged

boundaries such as the gravel front (Section 8.1.1). From Allen and Allen (2013) (ﬁg.7.49, p.274)

trends in continental basins are: (1) the sediment supply to the basin, which Allen et al.
(2013) referred to as the ‘Qs problem’, (2) the characteristic grain-size mix of this sediment
(Allen et al., 2015b), (3) the spatial distribution of subsidence and base-level changes
controlling accommodation and (4) hydraulic parameters and sedimentary processes in
the basin. One of the most important aspects underpinning the sediment routing system
concept and aiding downstream stratigraphic prediction is therefore the volumetric or mass
sediment budget.
Sediment budgets, despite their generic value in illustrating how the sediment routing
system functions, are unique to the case being studied (Hinderer, 2012). This problem
can be overcome by setting the surface sediment discharges and depositional ﬂuxes of
sediment routing systems within a mass balance framework (Strong et al., 2005; Paola
and Martin, 2012; Michael et al., 2013). In the mass balance framework, the cumulative
deposited volume of sediment in the down-system direction is normalised by the total
sediment volume and the total depositional length (Figure 1.4), and thereby illustrates in a
dimensionless fashion the interplay between the depositional ﬂux and the bypassed surface
sediment discharge. This not only allows systems of different shapes and lengths, but also
of different total sediment volumes, to be compared, and potentially permits the upscaling
of small laboratory tests to real stratigraphic problems (Strong et al., 2005; Paola and
Martin, 2012).
A mass or volume balance of the entire system allows a sediment budget to be evaluated
that balances the particulate sediment derived by physical weathering against sediment
volumes in depositional sinks (Clift et al., 2001a; Slaymaker, 2003; Tinker, de Wit, and
Brown, 2008; Carvajal and Steel, 2012; Hinderer, 2012; Michael et al., 2014b). Quan-
tiﬁcation of the sediment budget, its component ﬂuxes and the down-system evolution of
grain size therefore provides essential information to calibrate and test predictive models of
basin ﬁlling and sedimentary architecture (Paola, Heller, and Angevine, 1992; Marr et al.,
2000; Armitage et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011), including those derived from sequence
stratigraphy.

the depositional volume (or mass) by the total volume (or mass) deposited in the entire sediment
routing system. The mass balance co-ordinate χ therefore varies between 0 (at the origin, or apex of
the depositional system) to 1 at the depositional length Ld where sediment is exhausted. This allows
sediment routing systems with different sediment budgets, accommodation and size to be directly

Sediment Routing Systems: First Concepts
Strong et al. (2005) and Paola and Martin (2012) showed from both laboratory and
subsurface studies that ﬂuvial and deep marine sedimentary architectures and grain-size
patterns are governed primarily by mass extraction by selective deposition over geological
timescales. In other words, for the same ratio of sediment supply to total accommodation
space in any basin, the same facies assemblages and the same bulk grain-size characteristics
are expected to be present, regardless of system length and spatial pattern of tectonic sub-
sidence. Consequently, extraction of certain grain sizes by selective deposition provides a
fundamental control on the availability of ﬁner grain sizes downstream, thereby controlling
depositional environments, facies and stratigraphic architectures.
Sediment routing systems might be categorised and named from their source, their main
artery of sediment transport or their main depocentre. There are difﬁculties in whichever
method of categorisation in chosen. Most natural sediment routing systems have multiple
sediment sources, more than a single sediment transport system and occasionally different
depocentres (multi-source and multi-sink systems). For example, the western Adriatic mud
wedge is fed by the Adige, Po and several Apennines rivers (Weltje and Brommer, 2011).
Coastal currents supply the macrotidal Gulf of Kachchh in western India with sediment
derived from both the perennial Indus River as well as from a number of small ephemeral
‘dryland’ streams (Prizomwala, Bhatt, and Basavaiah, 2014). The Golo sediment routing
system of the western Mediterranean is fed from a single catchment in Corsica, but its efﬂux
is joined by the contribution of a littoral cell; sediment is stored on the continental shelf
and slope and intermittently discharged through shelf-edge canyons to lobes on the deep
sea ﬂoor of the Corsican Trough (Sømme et al., 2011). At a larger scale, the Orange River
drainage basin supplies sediment to a number of passive margin basins stretching from the
Falkland-Agulhas fracture zone in the south to the Walvis Ridge in the north (Rouby et al.,
2009). A number of independent ﬂuvial systems draining the North American continent,
such as the Brazos, Colorado and Mississippi, have supplied large volumes of sediment to
the Gulf of Mexico during the Cenozoic (Galloway, Whiteaker, and Ganey-Curry, 2011).
Each river system has its own coastal delta at times of sea level highstand, but river systems
merge on the continental shelf at times of sea level lowstand (Blum and Aslan, 2006; Blum
and Garvin, 2010) (Figure 10.9). The deep marine fan of the Bay of Bengal is supplied with
sediment from multiple sources, including the rivers of the eastern Ghats of peninsular
India and the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween and Irrawaddy river systems draining the
Himalaya-Tibetan region. The networks of sediment routing systems, as shown generically
in Figure 1.1, may therefore be complex (Figure 1.5). In many cases, the sediment routing
system can be named according to its main river artery. These main arteries correspond
closely to those rivers with outlets into oceans, inland seas and lakes, so the categorisation
of sediment routing systems is essentially the same as the challenge facing the authors of
global databases of sediment delivery to the ocean (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011). This
option of naming sediment routing systems from their main river arteries was adopted by
Helland-Hansen et al. (2016) in their review of ‘Earth’s natural hourglasses’.
Sediment routing systems are termed ‘Earth’s natural hourglasses’ (Helland-Hansen
et al., 2016) since they commonly involve a fairway that is broad in the hinterland

catchment and broad in the depositional zone, but relatively narrow in the transitional
zone between. Source-to-sink systems are viewed in a framework with three end-member
types: (1) ‘steep, short and deep’, which occur along active plate boundaries, and are
‘reactive’ (Allen, 2008a), such as the Var and Golo of the Mediterranean Sea and Monterey
and Astoria of the California Borderland; (2) ‘wide and deep’, which are characteristic
of passive continental margins, and are ‘buffered’, such as the Rhône, Danube, Niger,
Zambezi, Congo, Mississippi, Amazon and Nile; and (3) ‘wide and shallow’, which are
commonly located on normal thickness continental crust such as in foreland basins and
cratonic basins, as in the Po and Ganges. Clearly, there is a strong tectonic control on the
occurrence of this variability in sediment routing systems (Section 8.6).
The networks of sediment routing systems may thus be simple, involving a single
source area linked unambiguously to a single depositional sink, or complex, with additional
sources, sinks and sediment transport pathways (Figure 1.5). Complex sediment routing
systems may involve a primary route for sediment dispersal and a secondary route carrying
lower sediment discharges. Many sediment routing systems contain multiple sources and,
less commonly, multiple sinks (Table 1.1).
1.2 The Sediment Cascade
Particulate sediment and dissolved solids cascade through the sediment routing system with
characteristic ﬂuxes, which allows it to be treated as an essentially closed system in terms
of volume or mass (Figure 1.6). Closure of the sediment budget is a powerful tool, but

there are a number of reasons why this is problematical. The main reason is that solute
ﬂuxes enter the ocean to join a globally mixed pool. In addition, marine depositional sinks
may be difﬁcult to identify, constrain and sample, and very ﬁne-grained sediments may be
transported far into the open ocean. Third, part of the sediment routing system budget may
involve sediment transported by wind. Nevertheless, notwithstanding these problems, to
describe a sediment routing system ideally requires the identiﬁcation of regions of sediment
generation, transport and deposition, together with the estimation of the ﬂuxes of particulate
sediment and solutes that connect them.
In a hypothetical unglaciated sediment routing system, sediment is released from hill-
slope regolith by soil creep, debris ﬂows and landslides and is transferred to catchment
channels. A new set of processes is involved in the evacuation of this stored sediment from
the catchment into the ﬂuvial system. Further processes are responsible for down-system
advection, principally by ﬂoods, and intermittent storage in channel bars, levees, splays
and ﬂoodplains. Subsequent ﬂoods may or may not entrain these deposits. The result is
that sediment takes a large number of stochastic steps towards the coast. At the coast,
new processes take over to transport sediment by waves, tides, jets, geostrophic ﬂows and
gravity ﬂows to storage sites as shorelines, estuaries, coastal marshlands, deltas, shallow
marine sand sheets, shelfal mud belts, and coastal and shelf-edge clinoforms and sediment
prisms. In some cases, the ultimate sink is these coastal and shallow marine deposits, and

Figure 1.6 Concept of the sediment routing system from source to sink. The sediment routing
system is driven and perturbed by tectonics and climate. It comprises a number of morphodynamic,
mutually coupled subsystems or segments. The erosional engine feeds sediment to a predominantly
transportational system (the trajectory) and to long-term sinks. From Allen and Heller (2012) (ﬁg.
6.2, p.113), with permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
no sediment escapes onto the continental shelf and into the deep sea, as in Chesapeake
Bay, on the Atlantic coast of the United States (Meade, 1982). However, a ﬁnal step may
remobilise some of the riverine or marine sediment and transport it to depositional sinks
on the continental slope and deep basin ﬂoor (Figure 1.6). When viewed at the medium to
long timescale (more than 103 yr), sediment is simply released from upland sources and
delivered to marine sinks. At the shorter timescale, however, more important sources and
sinks are the storage sites along the sediment cascade, such as valley bottoms, terraces
and ﬂoodplains. The delivery of sediment to the marine basin ﬂoor (Covault and Graham,
2010) is therefore the end of a series of stochastic steps from sites of storage, known as
‘transient states’ or ‘staging areas,’ to the ‘absorbing state’ (Malmon et al., 2005) of long-
term deposition at the terminus of the sediment routing system (Figure 1.7). Sediment
routing systems, or individual segments within them such as the continental shelf, may
act as ‘conveyors’ or ‘capacitors’ in terms of the transmission of sediment (Covault and
Fildani, 2014).
Consequently, although in some instances sediment pulses may pass rapidly through the
routing system and in one cycle arrive on the deep marine basin ﬂoor, bypassing intervening
transient states, it is more common for signals originating in the source region, such as
the grain-size distribution of the sediment efﬂux, to be subject to transformation during
propagation through the sediment routing system (Weltje, 2012; Romans et al., 2015).

Within a sediment routing system undergoing tectonic subsidence, part of the surface
ﬂux in the sediment cascade is selectively sequestered at any point along the routing system,
until the surface ﬂux becomes exhausted at the downstream depositional limit (Paola and
Voller, 2005; Fedele and Paola, 2007; Allen, 2008a; Paola et al., 2009; Duller et al., 2010;
Allen and Heller, 2012; Paola and Martin, 2012; Michael et al., 2013, 2014a,b). Over
geological time, depending on the available accommodation and position of base level
(Muto and Steel, 2000), a portion of this depositional ﬂux is locked into stratigraphy (Allen
and Heller (2012), ﬁg.6.3), a phenomenon sometimes broadly referred to as ‘Landscapes
into Rock’ following the William Smith meeting with this name at the Geological Society

of London in 2010 (see http://romania-rocks.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/landscapes-into-rock-
part-1.html). The sequestration of merely a portion of the surface ﬂux of sediment to
build stratigraphy, the intermittency and spatial limitations of depositional events and the
obliterating effects of erosion together imply that the stratigraphic record is a far from
complete recorder of time. Allen (2008a) (p.275) wrote:
Time transforms sediment routing systems into geology, and like history, selectively samples from
the events that actually happened to create a narrative of what is recorded.
The simplest sediment routing system that can be imagined comprises a single upland
catchment that feeds sediment to a basin-margin fan, acting in a closed system, with no
sediment escape (Humphrey and Heller, 1995; Allen and Hovius, 1998; Allen and Dens-
more, 2000; Carrétier and Lucazeau, 2005; Densmore, Allen, and Simpson, 2007a; Pépin,
Carrétier, and Herail, 2010). In a prototype such as this, sediment can be unambiguously
linked to lithological sources in the hinterland catchment, and thermochronological and
cosmogenic signatures in the depositional sink of the fan can be reliably connected to
erosion in the source (Stock, Ehlers, and Farley, 2006). Commonly, however, sediment
routing systems are more complex and involve far-ﬁeld sediment transport, well-developed
alluvial sequestration (Castelltort and Van Den Driessche, 2003; Allen, 2008b; Covault
et al., 2013), complex sediment transport dynamics in the coastal and continental shelf areas
(Covault and Fildani, 2014) and multiple sources and/or multiple sinks (Vezzoli, Garzanti,
and Monguzzi, 2004; Weltje and Brommer, 2011) (Table 1.1) (Figure 1.5).
Some sediment routing systems are continental in scale, involving sources in strongly
contrasting climatic and tectonic settings, such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra systems
draining into the Bay of Bengal (Einsele, Ratschbacher, and Wetzel, 1996; Clift et al.,
2001a; Curray, Emmel, and Moore, 2002). In large, complex examples, sediment can be
traced back to source regions using a range of provenance methods (analysis of pebble
lithologies, heavy minerals, isotopic ﬁngerprinting and geochronology of detrital grains)
(Section 9.5), but mixing of ﬁngerprints from different sources during sediment transport
and down-system attenuation of source area signals introduce considerable uncertainties in
linking source(s) to sink(s). Identiﬁcation of source areas for detrital minerals in the basin
is important in understanding where sediment ultimately comes from, but is only a part of
understanding the sediment routing system. As Allen (2008a) (p.275) writes:
No matter how we make this match between erosional source area and depositional sink, provenance
studies cannot help us to fully understand the dynamics of the sediment routing system that conveyed
[the sediment] from source to sink. It is rather like being present at the birth of a baby and the funeral
of a man, but missing out on the life story.
Most studies of the sediment budget have addressed relatively modern systems, where
catchments serving as source regions and depositional sinks, such as dams, natural lakes
and ﬂoodplains, as well as the continental shelf, are well deﬁned (Einsele and Hinderer,
1997; Hinderer, 2012). Most present-day sediment routing systems are strongly inﬂuenced
by human activities. Longer-term budgets have also been estimated, particularly in the

Sediment Routing Systems: First Concepts
context of climate change and tectonic activity in mountain belts acting as source regions,
commonly using sediment isopachs derived from seismic reﬂection data, borehole informa-
tion and stratigraphic outcrops (Barnes and Heins, 2009; Brommer, Weltje, and Trincardi,
2009; Rouby et al., 2009; Lopez-Blanco et al., 2010; Weltje and Brommer, 2011; Carvajal
and Steel, 2012), by palaeohydrological analysis of upstream ﬂuxes from cross-sections of
alluvial deposits (Holbrook and Wanas, 2014), from inventories of lake basin, valley and
delta volumes (Kuhlemann et al., 2002; Walford, White, and Sydow, 2005; Tinker, de Wit,
and Brown, 2008), and from geochemical indices (Galy and France-Lanord, 2001). A range
of studies have addressed the long-term sediment delivery to the ocean from rivers at the
basin scale using seismic reﬂection and borehole data in the depositional sink (Métivier and
Gaudemer, 1999; Clift and Gaedicke, 2002; Walford, White, and Sydow, 2005; Tinker, de
Wit, and Brown, 2008; Rouby et al., 2009; Galloway, Whiteaker, and Ganey-Curry, 2011;
Guillocheau et al., 2012).
By connecting source to sink, and by keeping an inventory of the grain-size fractiona-
tion, depositional volumes and sediment calibre can be integrated throughout the sediment
routing system fairway, which solves concurrently two challenging problems: (1) the total
volume of particulate sediment derived from mountain catchments serving as ‘erosional
engines’ averaged over geological timescales can be calculated (Carvajal and Steel, 2012)
and compared with erosion estimates derived from thermochronology (Tinker, de Wit,
and Brown, 2008; Rouby et al., 2009; Michael et al., 2014b), and (2) the ‘global’ size
distribution of sediment released from mountain catchments at long timescales can be
obtained (Michael et al., 2014a) and used as a boundary condition in models of sediment
dispersal. For example, the ‘global’ grain-size mix ﬂuxed out of mountain catchments to
supply the mid-upper Eocene Escanilla palaeo-sediment routing system of the wedge-top
zone of the southern Pyrenees was 9% gravel, 25% sand and 64% ﬁner than sand, based
on about 4,000 km3 of sediment released over a 7.7 Myr period (Michael et al., 2013,
2014a).
Erosion and deposition rates, sediment ﬂuxes and grain sizes can be calculated in mod-
ern sediment routing systems using a variety of techniques targeted at short-term observa-
tional periods, but these calculated values cannot be easily upscaled to the longer timescales
of geological sediment routing systems. Ancient sediment routing systems, however, are
difﬁcult to recognise and investigate: they are likely to be only partially preserved as
stratigraphy, making the deﬁnition of their fairway problematical; depositional sinks are
commonly disconnected from erosional source regions; there may be multiple sources,
some of which may be difﬁcult to identify using conventional provenance methods; and
the chronological resolution may be inadequate to allow a conﬁdent correlation scheme to
be developed. Constraining the sediment budget of a geological sediment routing system is
therefore a deceptively challenging task, but one that is vital if we are to couple measure-
ments of rock exhumation and erosion rates in mountain belts with realistic estimates of the
timing, locus and magnitude of sediment supply to basins (Sinclair et al., 2005; Beamud
et al., 2010; Whitchurch et al., 2011; Carvajal and Steel, 2012; Filleaudeau, Mouthereau,
and Pik, 2012; Parsons et al., 2012).

1.2 The Sediment Cascade
17
Beyond the river mouth, the continental shelf can either act as a capacitor (storage
or staging area) or as a conveyor for sediment from the land to the deep sea (Covault
and Fildani, 2014). Shelves are conventionally regarded as capacitors during periods of
rising and high relative sea level (Vail, Mitchum, and Thompson, 1977; Jervey, 1988),
when the shelf offers accommodation for sediment preservation, and low river gradients
during times of elevated sea level result in lower ﬂuxes of sediment delivered to the shelf.
On the other hand, shelves may act as conveyors, particularly where canyons are incised
into continental shelves and intersect nearshore sediment transport pathways, or where
high sediment discharges from the land cause submarine deltas to migrate to the shelf
edge.
Off-shelf transport to the deep sea is therefore affected by a number of factors:
1 Relative sea level: transport rates may be reduced at times of sea level highstand due to
a reduction in river gradients (Posamentier and Vail, 1988; Burgess and Hovius, 1998;
Covault and Graham, 2010).
2 Shelf width: off-shelf transport may reduce as shelf width increases, which increases
shelf accommodation (Posamentier, Erskine, and Mitchum, 1991; Walsh and Nittrouer,
2003).
3 Sediment supply: transport to the deep sea may increase by the driving of deltas to the
shelf edge by high sediment discharges (Burgess and Hovius, 1998; Covault et al., 2007;
Carvajal, Steel, and Petter, 2009).
4 Connection of canyon heads: effective conveyance of the shelf is critically dependent on
the connection of canyon heads to high river and littoral sediment discharges (Covault
et al., 2011).
Although Eel Canyon, offshore California, is currently disconnected from large ﬂuvial
or littoral sediment sources, as it has been over the last thousands of years of rising and
high sea level (Burger, Fulthorpe, and Austin, 2001), over the hundred year timescale,
sediment budget studies indicate that a large percentage (approximately 80%) of sediment
has been exported from the shelf into the deep sea (Sommerﬁeld and Nittrouer, 1999).
Covault and Fildani (2014) therefore point out that the Eel shelf acts as a conveyor over the
short timescale of the last century while acting as a capacitor at the timescale of the last
million years.
The Washington–Oregon shelf is wider (25–60 km) than the Californian shelf (average
of 5 km) and is fed principally by the large sediment discharge of the Columbia River
(5–10 Mt yr−1), half of which is sequestered on the shelf (Sommerﬁeld and Nittrouer,
1999). Maxima in the delivery of sediment from the Columbia River are out of phase
with periods of high wave and current reworking, which promotes shelf storage. However,
routing of sediment to the Astoria canyon and fan system was most efﬁcient during peri-
ods of post-glacial marine transgression, when climate systems caused intense terrestrial
ﬂooding. The Washington–Oregon shelf therefore acts as a capacitor at the short timescale
of the present day, but as a conveyor during periods of post-glacial climate instability at the
timescale of glacial-interglacial cycles (Covault and Fildani, 2014).

The varied styles of routing of sediment in the cascade from source to sink can be
illustrated from two examples (Figure 1.8). The previously mentioned Eel sediment routing
system has a source region (area of 9,400 km2) in the mountainous topography of northern
California (Nittrouer et al., 2007) with a sediment discharge to the Paciﬁc Ocean of 12–16
Mt per year. Sediment discharges, most importantly in major ﬂoods, construct a prism on
the continental shelf, but most sediment is exported beyond the shelf edge to the deep sea
(Wheatcroft and Borgeld, 2000). Export to deep water is enhanced by storm wave action
superimposed on sediment gravity ﬂows.
.002
17:26:58

1.2 The Sediment Cascade
19
In contrast, the large Ganges–Brahmaputra system (catchment area 1,656,000 km2)
exports sediment to the vast Bengal Fan. At the historical timescale, about 30% of the
sediment released from source areas is trapped onshore, principally in tectonically subsid-
ing alluvial areas (Allison, 1998; Goodbred and Kuehl, 1999). Approximately 20% of the
sediment delivery to the ocean builds topsets of subaqueous clinoforms, and 20–31% is
stored in clinoform foresets, but along-shelf currents transport the remaining sediment to
the head of a major canyon (Swatch of No Ground) and thereby to the Bengal submarine
fan. Cyclones are particularly effective in advecting sediment to the canyon, and trigger
mass transport events that travel down to the Bengal Fan.
A realistic assessment of the nature of the sediment cascade from source to sink in most
real-world sediment routing systems clearly demands a sound understanding of the surface
dynamics of sediment transport in a broad range of environmental settings. This is challeng-
ing enough, but to interpret the stratigraphic record, and to invert it in order to understand
Earth history, requires us to also appreciate the ‘long result of Time’. Until the geomorphic
and oceanographic perspectives of the modern Earth and its land-ocean linkages (Romans
and Graham, 2013) are more closely married with the geological perspective of deep time,
we will ﬁnd that we are like the fortune-teller in Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra,
who says:
In Nature’s inﬁnite book of secrecy, A little I can read.
The sediment routing system philosophy offers an avenue of making progress through
such a marriage.

The Global Character of River Basins
This chapter provides an overview of the global distribution of river catchments at the
present day, since they are the powerhouses for the particulate and dissolved ﬂuxes of
sediment routing systems. Although some sediment routing systems are conﬁned to the
land surface, most export sediment to the ocean, where it is commonly mixed with sediment
from other sources. Sediment routing systems are therefore a network connecting sources
with sinks.
2.1 Mapping of the Terrestrial Segment of Sediment Routing Systems
Sediment routing systems connect erosional source regions with depositional sinks. At
the present day, erosional source areas are relatively easy to recognise, since they
comprise the upstream parts of river drainage basins. To map the erosional source areas
of sediment routing systems is therefore essentially a task of delineating the net erosional
parts of river catchments at a global scale. This process starts with an investigation of
global catchment maps available from online databases (www.cambridge.org/milliman,
which contains an environmental characterisation of 1,534 rivers; the Global Runoff Data
Centre, www.grdc.bafg.de, which contains information from more than 9,000 gauging
stations; major watersheds of the world from the WRI (World Resources Institute),
http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/4960). Such maps are based on elevation data obtained
from orbiting satellites or from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (e.g. http://
hydrosheds.cr.usgs.gov).
The number of rivers with drainage basins larger than a certain area follows a power law
for the range of basin area from 0.001 to 1 ×106 km2, suggesting that the distribution of
river basin size may be fractal (Turcotte, 1997). Using the Milliman and Farnsworth (2011)
database,
Nr(Ad > A) = aAd m
(2.1)
where Nr is the total number of river basins with an area Ad (in millions of km2) greater
than a certain size A, m is an exponent equal to –0.7903 and a is a coefﬁcient equal to 16.92
(Figure 2.1). The Milliman and Farnsworth (2011) database includes most large drainage
basins of area greater than 3,000 km2, but like other global databases, is less comprehensive

for smaller drainage basins, although small, mountainous catchments deliver a dispropor-
tionately high amount of sediment to the ocean (Milliman, 1995).
It is impractical to estimate the intercept a from ﬁeld data, since very small drainage
basin areas are not measured, whereas the maximum drainage basin area recorded is easily
available. If we deﬁne the maximum drainage basin area as Amax, then equation (2.1)
becomes
log(Nr(Ad > A)) = −mlog
Amax
A

(2.2)
As an example, if the slope m is −0.5 and the maximum drainage basin area Amax is
107 km2, then we should expect to ﬁnd 10 drainage basins with an area greater than
105 km2 and 100 drainage basins with an area greater than 103 km2.
The largest drainage basin area possible is set by the size of the continental land mass,
whereas the minimum area is constrained by the resolution of the particular technology
being used to map. The coefﬁcient in the power law of equation (2.1), or the maximum
drainage basin area Amax in equation (2.2), is a parameter whose value describes the overall
scale of drainage basin areas, whereas the exponent describes the shape of the distribution
of drainage basin area. Continents may differ from other continents in the value of a (or
Amax) and m, and a single continental landmass may also have different values depending
on climate and plate tectonic setting (Table 2.1).

Taking Africa as an example, the distribution of catchment size is different according
to whether rivers are draining towards the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, or Red Sea
and Mediterranean (Figure 2.2a). The slopes m of the straight line segments of the
bi-logarithmic plots of river drainage basins ﬂowing into the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian
Ocean are −0.63 and −0.74, whereas the maximum river drainage basin areas are approx-
imately 3.8 × 106 and 1.3 × 106 km2 respectively. The Nile is a very large river draining to
the Mediterranean (2.9×106 km2), but ﬁtting a straight line to Mediterranean/Red Sea data
is problematical because of the relatively small number of drainage basins sampled. The
same procedure can be followed for North America (Figure 2.2b). River drainage basins
ﬂowing to the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans have a slope of −0.73, and those draining to
the Paciﬁc Ocean have an almost identical slope of −0.76. The corresponding maximum
drainage basin areas are 3.3 × 106 and 0.85 × 106 km2 respectively. Once again, there are
too few data for drainage basins entering the Caribbean to draw meaningful conclusions.
The same picture emerges for river drainage basins in South America and in Europe and
Asia (Table 2.1, Figures 2.3 and 2.4).
Clearly, there are factors causing the different distributions of drainage basin area. A
primary factor is the topography associated with active, convergent margins compared with
the topography of passive, trailing-edge, continental margins. Passive margins included
in Figures 2.3 and 2.4 and Table 2.1 are the Arctic margin of North America, the U.S.
Eastern Seaboard, Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic margin of South America, the Atlantic and
Indian Ocean margins of Africa, the Indian Peninsula, the Yellow Sea and South China Sea
northeast of the Red River Fault Zone, the Arctic Ocean margin of Eurasia and the Atlantic

palaeogeographies where the rough dimensions of a continental land mass are known. In
this case, the appropriate values of Amax and m could be used to gain insights into the likely
distribution of drainage basin areas.
Drainage basin area has a well-known relationship to channel length, giving an aspect
ratio for drainage basin shape. In the case of simple transverse drainage from the ﬂank
of linear mountain belts, there is a regularity in the aspect ratio of catchment spacing and
straight-line catchment length, with a ratio of approximately 2.2 (Hovius, 1996). Taking
the global database compiled by Milliman and Farnsworth (2011), there is a power law
relationship between drainage basin area Ad (km2) and channel length L in km (Figure 2.6):
L = 2.28Ad 0.508
(2.5)
The power law in equation (2.5) has implications for average thalweg sinuosities in
drainage basins of different shape. For an equant, square-shaped catchment, the average
sinuosity must be 2.46 to satisfy equation (2.5). For a circular catchment, the average
thalweg sinuosity must be 2.20. Taking the Hovius relationship indicating rectangular
catchments with an aspect ratio of 2.2, the average thalweg sinuosity is 1.67. A global plot
of basin length versus river thalweg length reveals the average sinuosity for all drainage
basins (Figure 2.7). The majority of drainage basins of rivers discharging to the ocean have
sinuosities between 1 and 3. The linear trendline for these data gives an average global
sinuosity of 1.72 (R2 = 0.895).

located considerable distances inland from the coast. The global average sinuosity is 1.72.

2.2 Topology of River Basins
27
The present-day global distributions of catchment size, channel length and aspect ratio
are therefore well known and provide very useful guidance in the estimation of the drainage
of continental land masses in the geological past.
2.2 Topology of River Basins
Rivers are ﬂow pathways that empty into either an ocean (exorheic), or inland lake or other
topographic depression (endorheic). Using a simulated topological network (STN) of the
non-glacierised continental surface at 30-min resolution, potential ﬂow pathways of rivers
spanning orders 1 to 6 (Strahler, 1957) have been constructed (Vörösmarty et al., 2000).
Only two river basins are at order 6, the Amazon and Lena. The resolution of the STN
determines a lower limit of river basin size of about 25 × 103 km2, which reduces the
number of stream orders compared to those revealed by detailed topographic maps. There
are 6,152 individual watersheds represented in the STN for the 133.1 × 106 km2 of non-
glacierised land area of the Earth. A plot of topological order i versus the logarithm of
the number of river basins in each continent of order greater than i is shown in Figure 2.8.
Although there are some clear differences between continents, the slopes for each continent
are similar, indicating a common pattern of river branching over the Earth’s surface.
There is more variation in the distribution of river order when viewed in terms of the
world’s major ocean basins into which the river enters (Figure 2.9). Since the world’s
continents have very different underlying tectonic and thermal processes controlling their
margins (Allen and Allen, 2013), the distribution of river order for different receiving

basins reﬂects these tectonic styles and offers predictive capability in assessing drainage
basin development and particulate delivery of palaeo-continents in the geological past. The
Atlantic Ocean, which is fringed by passive margins, stands out as having a high pro-
portion of contributing river basins of high order. That is, passive margins are fed by large
drainage basins, potentially carrying high particulate and solute loads. Rivers terminating in
endorheic basins also have a relatively high proportion of high order examples. In contrast,
the Paciﬁc Ocean is fringed by active margins involving continent-ocean and ocean-ocean
subduction. There is a high proportion of low order river basins entering the Paciﬁc Ocean.
Although many of the rivers entering subduction-type margins are small in catchment area,
they are commonly high-gradient, and may therefore contribute high unit-width discharges
of sediment into the ocean (Milliman and Syvitski, 1992), with outlet points closely spaced
along the tectonically active continental margin.
The mean drainage basin area spans several orders of magnitude, reaching greater than
106 km2 for orders 5 and 6. River order is not directly related to mean basin area, but
globally there is a progressive increase in mean basin area with ascending topological
order. River basins of order 5 and 6 drain 45% of the entire land area. About half
of the terrestrial globe is drained by the 50 largest river basins in the STN at 30-min
spatial resolution. Highly skewed distributions of mean river basin area are found in each
continental landmass. The mean length of the mainstem increases across river basin order
from less than 100 to greater than 4,300 km. The 50 largest rivers (ranked by river basin

area) all have mainstem lengths in excess of 1,000 km. The distribution of mainstem length
is potentially a valuable parameter in modelling catchment development and sediment
discharge in geological sediment routing systems where only broad palaeogeographies
are known.
River topological order, catchment area and sediment discharge are all related to the
mean catchment length. The mean distance to the ocean for individual continents derived
from the STN shows that the catchments draining across active and passive continental
margins are strikingly different. In South America, the mean distance to the Atlantic Ocean
is 1,429 km, whereas the mean distance to the Paciﬁc Ocean is just 134 km. Likewise,
in North America, the mean distance of rivers draining to the Atlantic Ocean is 1,030
km compared with mean distances of 793 km and 716 km for the Paciﬁc and Arctic
Oceans respectively. The continental drainage divide is therefore displaced towards the
active margin of continents due to the mountain building associated with plate convergence.
As a result, 89% of the continent of South America and 56% of the area of North America
drain into the Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, only 7% of South America and 23% of North
America drain into the Paciﬁc Ocean. Signiﬁcant portions of Asia (20%) and Australasia
(28%) are occupied by river systems that drain internally, and which therefore do not
contribute to the global ﬂux of sediment to the ocean.
The global mean travel distance to the river mouth across all STN ﬂow pathways is
1,050 km. Run-off therefore travels a mean distance of 1,050 km to the sea, with important
variation between individual continents and receiving ocean basins. If the mean speed of
channelised water is 0.5 m s−1, and neglecting lakes, reservoirs and wetlands, the mean
travel time of run-off for the world’s 50 largest river basins is about 60 days. Although
this may approximate the travel time of solutes in pristine rivers, particulate sediment load
makes slower progress through the terrestrial sediment routing system due to intermittent
deposition (Malmon et al., 2003). The effect of alluvial sequestration on sediment transit
times is discussed in Section 4.5, within a probabilistic framework in Section 8.3, and
against the background of the transient response of landscapes in Section 8.5.
The Land2Sea database compiled by Bernhard Peucker-Ehrenbrink contains data
on the sizes of 1,519 river basins draining to the ocean, covering approximately 79%
of the exorheic land area (Peucker-Ehrenbrink, 2009) (Table 2.2). The river drainage
basins are grouped into regions following the categorisation of Graham, Famiglietti, and
Maidment (1999) (Figure 2.10). Although these regional continental watersheds provide
a useful basis for initialisation of hydrologic, terrestrial ecosystem and climate change
models, they are not directly related to the plate tectonic underpinning of continental
topography.
The western ﬂanks of North and South America, which are dominated by active plate
tectonic settings characterised by subduction, fall close to the origin in Figure 2.11, indi-
cating small average river basin areas. In comparison, extensional, trailing-edge passive
margins, such as those of eastern South America, the Russian Arctic, the North American
Arctic and West Africa, have moderate to high average basin areas.

2.3 Global Particulate Sediment and Solute Delivery to the Ocean
The bulk of particulate and dissolved solids is transported across continents and into the
oceans by running water. Rivers discharge approximately 36,000 km3 of fresh water into
the ocean each year (Figure 2.12), carrying more than 20 × 109 tons of dissolved and
particulate material (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011). The primary source of information
on the sediment ﬂuxes across the surface of the Earth therefore comes from gauging stations
on rivers. There have been a number of databases containing global information on rivers
and their sediment loads. The relatively recent compilation by John Milliman and Elizabeth
Farnsworth (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011) covers 1,534 rivers draining 86.6 × 106 km2
of watershed, which can be compared with a total land area of 148×106 km2 for the Earth,
and 105 × 106 km2 for the total area draining to the ocean, the remainder being internally
drained, or endorheic.

2.3.1 Run-off
The transfers of solid particulate and dissolved loads are driven by the run-off of precip-
itation. In total, the river discharge of fresh water into the ocean is equivalent to a mean
annual run-off of about 350 mm yr−1 (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011). River hydrology
is a reﬂection of the topographic relief, vegetation and climate of the drainage basin, but
the primary factor correlating with water discharge is drainage basin size. This is illustrated
by a log-log plot of drainage basin area versus mean annual discharge (Figure 2.13). In the
hydrological budget, groundwater is relatively unimportant in the total freshwater discharge
to the ocean, but is more important in the seaward transfer of dissolved ions, including
nutrients (Moore, 1996). One billion tons of dissolved solids are thought to be discharged
to the global ocean each year through groundwater (Dzhamalov and Safronova, 2001),
which is one third of the rate discharged by rivers.
Precipitation varies very widely globally from effectively nil in hyperarid regions to
10 m yr−1 in some equatorial mountain belts (Section 9.2). It can also vary spatially and
temporally within a drainage basin, particularly where the catchment has rugged topog-
raphy. Global maps of precipitation are available from internet databases (e.g. Climate
Research Unit, East Anglia University, UK) to inform hydrological models of sediment
routing systems. There are water losses due to evapotranspiration, which generally reduces

with increasing latitude, storage (as in recharging aquifers and lakes) and consumption
for human uses, leaving a reduced discharge as run-off. Run-off is the principal agent for
geomorphic change.
The 12 rivers that individually discharge more than 400 km3 of water annually into
the ocean occupy about 25% of the total land area of the Earth and in total discharge
13,800 km3 of fresh water annually (Table 2.3). Since the total freshwater discharge is
about 36,000 km3 annually, these 12 rivers are responsible for about 35% of the total
global discharge. The global chemistry of the ocean is therefore strongly inﬂuenced by
a relatively few major rivers (Section 3.1.1). The global distribution of river discharge to
the ocean depends on catchment size and precipitation regime (neglecting ice-melt run-off
from Antarctica and Greenland). At the present day, rivers draining northern South America
and southern Asia/Oceania, with annual precipitation rates of more than 2,000 mm yr−1,
dominate discharge to the ocean.
Of the 12 rivers listed in Table 2.3, most drain across passive margins into the ocean,
and several have hinterlands situated in wet mountainous topography caused by tectonic
convergence. Although rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco, Congo and Changjiang are in
regions of high run-off, the Asian rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean are semi-arid, and
it is the very large drainage basin areas of these rivers that contribute to the high freshwater
discharges at their mouths.
Clearly, a thorough understanding of the ﬂuxes of present-day sediment routing systems
requires a detailed knowledge of the patterns and discharges of run-off, but the investigation

of palaeo-sediment routing systems demands a different line of attack. Not only are palaeo-
catchments difﬁcult to identify and characterise, but the prevailing climate at the time is
also unknown at the resolution characteristic of the present day. There need to be rules of
thumb to aid hindcasting of drainage basin hydrology. First, palaeoclimatic information
can be obtained from soil types, chemical sediments in lakes, isotopic composition of
cave deposits, and palaeoﬂoral and palaeofaunal assemblages. Second, palaeogeographic
position and palaeotopographic character can be used to make general statements about
the likely hydrology of river drainage basins. There is a broad latitudinal variation in run-
off, with high values in equatorial-tropical latitudes, low values in the subtropics, and high
values again in the temperate zone, especially where ocean circulation and topography
combine in effect.
Today, the greatest run-off (mm yr−1) is in short, steep catchments where mountainous
topography causes orographic rain, whereas low run-off rivers not surprisingly tend to
drain regions in arid and semi-arid climates. The pattern of run-off at the present day
can be used to make inferences of run-off in the past, particularly if the hydrology can
be associated with plate tectonic background. For instance, the western margin of North
and South America is an ocean-continental convergent margin associated with oceanic
subduction and magmatism. Where the high topography along this margin from Alaska
to Tierra del Fuego coincides with high convective or frontal precipitation, as in Alaska,
British Columbia, Washington, Central America and southern Chile, high run-off rivers are
situated. However, the discharge of fresh water to the ocean is considerably greater where

precipitation is collected in very large drainage basins that transport water eastwards to
the trailing-edge passive margin, such as the Amazon-Orinoco in South America, and the
Mississippi and St Lawrence rivers of North America. The interrogation of global databases
therefore requires geological insights to be used that are transferable to the palaeo-sediment
routing systems of the geological record.
2.3.2 Particulate Loads
The study of the particulate loads of rivers is a powerful way of understanding the way in
which sediment routing systems function at the present day. Particulate loads are a direct
indication of surface sediment ﬂuxes and a means of estimating denudation rates in the
river catchments feeding sedimentary basins.
Particulate sediment can be transported by rivers in suspension or in contact with the
bed, largely dependent on the grain size of the sediment in relation to the velocity of
the ﬂow. Consequently, sediment grains may change in their mode of transport within a
single ﬂood event and along the course of a river. A simple but useful concept is that of
the ‘transport stage’ (Francis, 1973). The dimensionless ratio of the shear velocity driving
downstream sediment transport u∗and the settling velocity of the sediment grain w gives
an indication of whether grains will move as bedload (u∗/w < 1) or as suspended load
(u∗/w > 1). Discharge data from river gauging stations generally refer to suspended loads
rather than total loads. That is, in general any bedload transport is ignored.
Yield and Denudation Rate
The sediment loads of pristine rivers (unaffected by man) allow the average denudation
rate, or sediment yield, of the contributing catchment area to be calculated. If A is the area
of the catchment, Qtotal is the discharge of sediment and solutes at the exit of the drainage
basin, there are no additional sources or sinks of solutes and particulate sediment, and there
is no change in storage of sediment within the drainage basin over time, long-term average
denudation rate is simply
∂h
∂t = (1 −φ)
ρ
Qtotal
A
(2.6)
where h is the elevation of the Earth’s surface, t is time and φ is the porosity of rocks of
density ρ undergoing erosion in the catchment. Discharge is measured in mass per unit
time (kg yr−1 or t yr−1). Measurement of both the particulate and solute loads of rivers is
needed to calculate the total denudation rate. ‘Sediment yield’ refers to the component of
the denudation that generates solid particulate sediment:
Y = Qp
A
(2.7)
where the sediment yield is Y, with units of mass ﬂux (kg m−2 yr−1) and Qp is the
particulate sediment discharge. As an example, the annual solid particulate load of the
.003
15:05:07

The Global Character of River Basins
Amazon River at its mouth is 1,150 Mt yr−1 (1 megaton is 109 kg), and the annual solute
load is 223 Mt yr−1, making a total load of 1,373 Mt yr−1. The drainage area of the River
Amazon is 6,150,000 km2. The sediment yield is therefore 187 t km−2 yr−1, whereas
the total average denudation rate is 223 t km−2 yr−1. If rock density ρ is 2,700 kg m−3
and the average rock porosity φ is 5%, the denudation rate averaged across the entire
Amazon basin is 79 mm kyr−1. It is important to appreciate that sediment yield refers
to the total particulate discharge averaged over the upstream contributing drainage area.
Consequently, if sediment is stored in downstream reaches, as is common in large drainage
basins, sediment delivery to the ocean measured at gauging stations close to the river outlet
gives a value of sediment yield that bears no relation to the average denudation rate of
sediment source regions. The sequestered sediment in ﬂoodplains not only drops out of
the oceanward ﬂux, but also may be subjected to intense chemical weathering, thereby
releasing enhanced ﬂuxes of solutes (Johnsson and Meade, 1990; Willenbring, Codilean,
and McElroy, 2013). The lower basin of the Amazon traps a net 1–2 Gt of sediment per
year, which does not reach the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 2.14). The bulk of the sediment
carried by the Amazon River and its tributaries comes from steep, rapidly incising rivers
in the Andes (Aalto, Dunne, and Guyot, 2006) (2,300–3,100 Mt yr−1). The Madeira river
system alone provides more than 700 Mt yr−1 of suspended sediment to the Amazon trunk
stream. In the Andes, average physical erosion rates are far in excess of the averaged
rate of 0.08 mm yr−1 previously quoted. The lower parts of major river basins therefore
may sequester large volumes of particulate sediment. In the conterminous United States,
it is estimated that only about 10% of the eroded sediment reaches the oceans (Holeman,
1980). On the Atlantic coast of United States, rivers draining the Piedmont, such as the
Susquehanna River, deliver water and sediment (3 Mt yr−1 enters Conowingo Dam) into
large estuaries such as Chesapeake Bay. However, coastal zone sinks are fed with sediment
not only from rivers but also from shore erosion and from the continental shelf. In cases
such as Chesapeake Bay, no sediment bypasses the coastal zone en route for the continental
shelf and deep sea (Schubel and Carter, 1976).
The extent of storage is likely to increase in larger drainage basins, which explains
the well-established inverse relationship between drainage basin area and sediment yield
(Milliman and Meade, 1983; Milliman and Syvitski, 1992) (Figure 2.15). The regression
of all river data in the Milliman and Syvitski (1992) database gives
Y = exp(9.18 −0.46lnA)
(2.8)
where Y is the yield in kg m−2 yr−1 and A is drainage basin area in m2.
The sediment and solute discharges of rivers entering the ocean are therefore an indicator
of catchment-averaged physical and chemical denudation rates using equation (2.6), but
the denudation rate actually experienced by a source region for sediment depends on the
amount of storage in the alluvial valley Qa and the percentage area of the river basin that
is depositional rather than eroding, Fa. Equation (2.6) can therefore be modiﬁed to give the
physical denudation rate averaged over the eroding fraction of the river basin

river basin becomes 1.2–1.8 mm yr−1. The discharge into the alluvial sink and the fractional
area of the alluvial tract are expected to co-vary. Inspection of equation (2.9) shows that an
increase in alluvial storage increases the calculated denudation rate in the source region
necessary to explain the rate of delivery at the river mouth.
A number of processes affect the relationship of the sediment and solute efﬂuxes leaving
the channel-hillslope systems of the catchment area Qhc and the sediment and solute ﬂuxes
entering the ocean Qo (Figure 2.16). Within the alluvial system there are sequestration
losses of the riverine load to sediment deposition Qs, counteracted to some extent by gains
due to reworking of alluvial sediment Qr. The riverine solute load is reduced by losses
due to cementation of alluvial sediment and evaporation Qf , counteracted to some extent
by gains due to the generation of solutes through chemical weathering Qcw. The alluvial
valley of sediment routing systems is therefore a dynamic zone involving gains/losses and
transformations of particluate sediment and solutes rather than a simple conveyor belt of
detritus. The sediment and solute delivery to the ocean is therefore not a direct recorder of
catchment efﬂuxes, particularly in sediment routing systems with large alluvial tracts.
The sediment release of catchment areas acting as source regions can be compared with
sediment volumes in depositional basins. Depositional sediment volumes are generally
estimated from isopachs and cross-sections derived from borehole and seismic reﬂection
data (Métivier et al., 1999; Clift, 2006). For example, the average solid phase accumulation
rate for Asian sedimentary basins since the beginning of the Tertiary has been calculated

after correction of stratigraphic thicknesses for the effects of compaction (Métivier et al.,
1999). The Bengal Basin contains a vast amount of Upper Tertiary sediments (locally up
to 21 km in thickness) deposited primarily from southwestward prograding deltas feeding
a large deep-sea cone. The Bengal Basin has accumulated 12 × 106 km3 solid volume
during the Tertiary, with a rate of 0.45 × 106 km3 Myr−1 over the last 2 Myr. The Bengal
Basin has received sediment from the Ganges, Brahmaputra and the rivers of the eastern
platform of India (Mahanadi, Krishna and Godavari), which have a total drainage area of
approximately 2.266 × 106 km2. The average mechanical denudation rate for these Indian
subcontinent catchments during the Quaternary is about 200 mm kyr−1, with an average
sediment yield of 546 t km−2 yr−1 (using ρ = 2,750 kg m−3). The Ganges, Brahmapu-
tra, Mahanadi, Krishna and Godavari rivers have a combined river mouth discharge of
0.49 × 106 km3 Myr−1. This is in excellent agreement with the estimate derived from
the volume of preserved stratigraphy, and indicates that present-day discharges in large,
buffered systems may be closely representative of longer-term (geological) rates (Einsele
et al., 1996; Métivier et al., 1999; Métivier and Gaudemer, 1999).

Calculations of the total annual sediment discharge to the world ocean range from 14 ×
109 tons (Syvitski et al., 2005) to 16 × 109 tons (Milliman and Meade, 1983) and 19 ×

southeast Asia and Oceania, which together account for approximately two-thirds of the
global delivery (Figure 2.17).
Compilations of suspended sediment concentrations (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011)
(tab.2.5, p.27), which show that the global average for suspended sediment concentration
is 500 mg l−1, are strongly inﬂuenced by climate. Rivers with the highest concentrations
are generally found in subtropical arid to semi-arid climates. In contrast, the lowest con-
centrations (1–2 mg l−1) are found in low-gradient shield terrains, as in northern Europe.
Compilations of suspended sediment loads (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011) (tab.2.6, p.28)
indicate the importance of the elevation class of the drainage basin. Compilations of sed-
iment yield based on suspended loads (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011) (tab.2.7, p.29),
which show a global annual average for suspended sediment yield of 190 t km−2, also
suggest a dependence on elevation class. Most high-yield rivers drain mountains with
headwaters at elevations greater than 3,000 m. All high-yield rivers are small, with areas
less than 3,000 km2.
As seen in relation to run-off, sediment discharges at river mouths vary strongly accord-
ing to the tectonic style of plate margin. Active margins characterised by subduction, such
as the western margin of North and South America, have river basins with high discharges
relative to their size that deliver sediment quickly to the deep sea via canyons incised into
narrow continental shelves. Passive margins, however, are typiﬁed by large, low-gradient
rivers that despite their very high discharges have low to moderate yields. They commonly
border wide continental shelves, and much of their sediment load is trapped in estuaries,
deltas and the continental shelf. During sea level lowstands, sediment may bypass the

coastline and shelf and be fed directly to the deep sea, as in the case of the Amazon system
(Section 3.2.5).
As in the case of water discharge, suspended sediment loads also increase with drainage
basin area, though there is considerable variation. The reasons for some of this variation
can be appreciated by categorising river basins according to the maximum elevation of
their headwaters (Milliman and Syvitski, 1992; Hay, 1998) (Figure 2.15). Mountainous
rivers have higher sediment loads than lowland rivers by three orders of magnitude, for the
same drainage basin area. A global database (Summerﬁeld and Hulton, 1994) revealed
an exponential relationship between the average denudation rate E (mm yr−1) and the
maximum elevation hmax (m):
E = 0.0072exp(0.0015hmax)
(2.11)
for hmax > 100 m, which can be modiﬁed to give a relationship for annual sediment load Qs
(t yr−1), neglecting for the moment porosity in the rocks and regolith undergoing erosion,
the contribution of bedload to the annual sediment load and the denudation attributable to
chemical weathering releasing solutes:
Qs = 0.0072(106)exp(0.0015hmax)ρ
(2.12)
where ρ is the density of rock, regolith and sediment. If ρ = 2,700 kg m−3, E = 0.5 mm
yr−1 and the drainage basin area A = 10 km2, the sediment load becomes 13,500 t yr−1.
The inﬂuence of maximum elevation on sediment load can be understood from the
dependence of erosion rate on catchment area relief (Ahnert, 1970; Pinet and Souriau,
1988), since high relief implies high river gradients that cause more ﬂuid stress to be
exerted on the river bed. High catchment area relief is also commonly generated where the
landscape is built by earthquakes associated with active tectonics. Ground shaking is highly
effective at releasing mass ﬂows on mountain hillslopes (Hovius, Stark, and Allen, 2007).
Consequently, sediment loads of rivers are directly linked to the tectonic environment of
the catchment area (Hovius, 1998) (Figure 2.18). High elevations are also likely to increase
rates of precipitation through orographic effects (Reiners et al., 2003).
Glaciated terrains appear to have a different and more complex relation between sed-
iment discharge and catchment size than unglaciated river basins (Hallet, Hunter, and
Bogen, 1996) (Section 7.2.1). Ice and snow cover in mountains may increase physical and
chemical weathering, particularly where the glacier or snowpack is warm-based. Conse-
quently, Vezzoli, Garzanti, and Monguzzi (2004) found a positive relationship between
sediment yield and glaciated area in the Western Alps. Sediment delivery from the upland
part of glaciated catchments may be particularly high when pluvial conditions promote
the rapid evacuation of loose morainic material from a previously glaciated region. There
may be peaks in sediment yield, therefore, following glacial maxima at times of glacial-
interglacial cyclicity.
Some currently glaciated basins, such as the steep and wet catchments of Alaska and the
Southern Alps of New Zealand, have very high sediment loads and yields, in excess of those
of most nonglaciated settings. A global compilation of about 18,000 thermochronological

measurements suggest that erosion rates have increased signiﬁcantly over the last 2–4 Myr
coincident with the occurrence of northern hemisphere glaciation (Herman et al., 2013).
Little is known about the sediment budget of high-latitude, glacierised landmasses such as
Greenland and Antarctica. The annual sediment discharges from wet-based glaciers range
widely, from 100–10,000 t km−2 yr−1 (Gurnell, Hannah, and Lawler, 1996).
Bedload Fluxes
Bedload ﬂuxes are generally not included in the sediment loads measured at river mouths.
In the downstream reaches of large, low-gradient rivers, such as the Mississippi River
and Amazon River, there is little transport of bedload, but in steep and some ephemeral
catchments the coarse bedload is potentially very important, most of which is transported
during intermittent major ﬂoods (Turowski, Rickenmann, and Dadson, 2010). Bedload

transport rates are commonly taken to be a ﬁxed percentage of the total particulate load,
such as 10−20% in general, or 20−40% for mountain streams. The empirical basis of
these estimates is, however, uncertain. The fraction of the total load transported as bedload
varies widely, to smaller or greater extent dependent of catchment geology, degree of forest
cover or glaciation, grain size of channel bed (gravel versus sand) and channel slope.
The partitioning of bedload and suspended load has also been expressed by a regression
against drainage area A in km2, principally using data from rivers in the European Alps
(Schlunegger and Hinderer, 2003):
Fbed = 0.525 −0.0506 ln(A)
(2.13)
and
Fsus = 0.475 + 0.0506 ln(A)
(2.14)
where Fbed and Fsus are the bedload and suspended load fractions respectively.
Inspection of equations (2.13) and (2.14) shows that the bedload fraction ranges from 0
to 0.525 and the suspended load fraction ranges from 0.475 to 1 for drainage basin areas up
to 835,304 km2, but the scatter of ﬁeld data shows that these equations only provide a good
ﬁt for small catchments of up to 5,000 km2 (Turowski, Rickenmann, and Dadson, 2010).
Suspended load transport rates can also be expressed as a power law function of bedload
transport rates (Métivier et al., 2004; Meunier et al., 2006). The median relationship is
Qbed = aQb
sus
for
Qsus ≤(a/c)1/(d−b)
(2.15)
and
Qbed = cQd
sus
otherwise
(2.16)
where the best-ﬁt values of the constants a, b, c and d for the median ﬁt are 0.833 ± 0.052
[kg sec−1]1−b, 1.3240 ± 0.079, 0.437 ± 0.210 [kg s−1]1−d and 0.647 ± 0.076 respectively,
and sediment transport rates Q are in kg s−1. The maximum value of the bedload transport
rate as a percentage of the total transport rate occurs at Qsus = (a/c)1/(d−b), which for the
values of the constants given earlier gives 38% bedload at a suspended sediment transport
rate of 0.386 kg s−1.
A combination of the relationships in equations (2.13) and (2.14) and in equations (2.15)
and (2.16) is potentially valuable in carrying out simulations of sediment transport in
catchments of known size.
Equations (2.13) and (2.14) indicate that the fraction of bedload in the surface discharge
should become negligible in rivers draining large catchments, which further suggests that
these rivers should be discharging primarily silt and mud into the ocean. In the Solimoes-
Amazon system, mean annual ﬂuxes of sand and of silt-clay are known for the period
1974–1989 (Dunne et al., 1998). The sand ﬂux as a percentage of the total ﬂux stays
constant at about 20% over a downstream distance of 2,750 km, and 248 Mt yr−1 of sand
passes through the gauging station at Obidos. An increase in the sand ﬂux of the Solimoes-
Amazon system is caused by the joining of the River Madeira at 2,300 km downstream

of Iquitos. Despite the enormous size of the Amazon system, therefore, a relatively high
proportion of the total sediment discharge is made up of sand. To reconcile the predicted
bedload fraction with the observed discharges of sand and silt-clay requires that the bulk
of the sand travels in suspension and that bedload transport rates are negligible where the
Amazon enters the Atlantic Ocean.
The bedload as a percentage of the total sediment load delivered to 51 globally dis-
tributed deltas (Table 2.4) was calculated using a Bagnold (1966) bedload transport equa-
tion (Syvitski and Saito, 2007):
Qb =
ρs
ρs −ρf
ρf gQβ
wDgeb
tanφ
(2.17)
when u ≥ucr, where ρs and ρf are the densities of sediment and water respectively; g is the
acceleration due to gravity; Dg is the gradient of the delta plain measured along the main
channel; eb is the dimensionless bedload efﬁciency; β is a bedload rating term, assumed
to equal 1 by Syvitski and Saito (2007); φ is the limiting angle of repose of sediment
grains lying on the river bed; u is the stream velocity; and ucr is the critical velocity for
bedload sediment transport. The bedload calculations show an average value of 6.6%, with
a range of 0.7% (Mississippi) to 30% (Kolyma). Elevated bedload fractions may result
from a number of factors: values may be high because of proximity of the delta to steep
highlands, or because of high, ﬂashy discharges of streams draining glaciers, or where the
suspended sediment load is particularly low.
The regression of a log-log plot of suspended sediment discharge (kg s−1) versus
bedload sediment discharge (kg s−1) for 51 deltas gives
Qb = 0.8Q0.5926
s
(2.18)
with R2 = 0.58 (Figure 2.19). However, the bedload fraction does not correlate well
with either catchment area or length of the main stem using equation (2.17), in contrast
to equation (2.13). Comparing equation (2.18) with equation (2.16), the exponent d of
0.5926 based on the delta database compares favourably with the value of 0.647 ± 0.076
based on the database in Métivier et al. (2004). The coefﬁcient c of 0.8 in equation (2.18)
compares with the value of 0.437 ± 0.210 based on the database in Métivier et al. (2004).
The difference in the value of the power law coefﬁcient, which corresponds to the intercept
in cross plots of Qb versus Qs, is illustrated in Figure 2.19. The Bagnold (1966) equation
slightly overestimates the bedload discharge relative to equation (2.16).
2.3.3 Dissolved Solids
The database on dissolved solids (solutes) is less extensive than for suspended particulate
sediment, but databases such as GEMS-GLORI (Meybeck and Ragu, 1996, 1997) provide
data from nearly 1,000 rivers. The total discharge of dissolved solids (TDS) is known

phosphorus, nitrogen and silica, all important as nutrients, is more patchy. Rivers discharge
annually about 3.8 billion tons (3.8 × 109 tons) of dissolved solids to the global ocean, the
highest ﬂuxes being in Asian rivers and lowest in those in Africa and the Eurasian Arctic
(Figure 2.20). There are contrasting views on the controls on the chemistry of rivers, with

as the dominant control (Section 3.1.1).

effective, precipitation must penetrate to deep levels in the regolith in order to promote the
chemical breakdown and ﬂushing away of solutes into the groundwater system (Sections
9.1 and 9.2). For a given bedrock, inﬁltration and ﬂushing depend on climate and topog-
raphy. For instance, in semi-arid regions there is a scarcity of water available for ﬂushing,
and solutes are drawn to the surface in dry periods and reprecipitated, reducing chemical
weathering of bedrock. Topography affects solute yield through the effect of slopes on the
inﬁltration and ﬂushing of water. On steep slopes, ﬂushing rates are high, which reduces
the time available for chemical weathering of regolith and bedrock. On low slopes, ﬂushing
rates are low, which limits the removal of solutes. Optimum conditions for solute removal
are found in regions with moderate precipitation and gentle upland slopes.

Chemical weathering rate is relative to that of granite. The global contribution of each rock type is
the product of the percentage surface area and the relative weathering rate. Amphibolite has been
given the same relative weathering rate as ultrabasics; arkose and greywacke are attributed relative
weathering rates of 2; rhyolite and quartzite are given the same relative weathering rate as quartz-
arenite since all are dominated by SiO2; evaporites is given as a range from gypsum to halite. The
percentage of outcrop of different rock types is based on early compilation exercises (Ronov and
Yaroshevskiy, 1972, 1976; Blatt and Jones, 1975; Sibley and Wilband, 1977).
The chemical denudation of regolith caused by removal of solutes does not, however,
equate strongly to the total dissolved solids in rivers. This is partly because of non-
denudational inputs (precipitation, wind-blown dust, salt aerosols, mineralisation of organic
matter, plant metabolism and, today, human pollution). The total dissolved solids in rivers
may also reﬂect chemical weathering of ﬂuvial sediment during storage in foodplains,
splays and bars (Johnsson and Meade, 1990). Solutes may in addition be lost through
evaporation and precipitation in soils and groundwater. Nevertheless, there are clear trends
in the total dissolved solids (TDS) of river water draining certain catchment lithologies
(Meybeck, 1987). The relative global contribution of solutes from pristine rivers draining
certain bedrock lithologies is the product of the percentage of the Earth’s terrestrial surface
covered by those lithologies and an index of the chemical weathering rate relative to granite
(Table 2.5). By far the greatest contribution of solutes comes from shales, principally
.003
15:05:07

2.4 Chemical Weathering Fluxes Associated with Glaciation

because of their large outcrop area; evaporites (gypsum, halite) due to their high rate
of dissolution; and carbonates (limestones and dolomites) resulting from a combination of
high weathering rate and high outcrop area. Consequently, notwithstanding the effects of
climate and topography previously described, rivers draining from an exhumed, carbonate-
dominated passive margin or fold-thrust belt are likely to carry high solute loads. Rates of
denudation in these hinterlands are strongly impacted by solute mass transfer. In contrast,
rivers draining cratonic shields composed of granites and gneisses are likely to have low
solute loads, and chemical denudation rates are a small percentage of the total denudation
rate. The ratio of chemical denudation measured as the solute yield derived from TDS in
river water, and physical denudation measured from the total suspended sediment of river
water, is shown for 28 of the world’s largest rivers in Table 2.6 (Summerﬁeld and Hulton,
1994) and in Figure 2.21.
The chemical denudation caused by solute mass transfer as a percentage of the total
denudation varies across a very wide range, from less than 3% (Brahmaputra) to nearly
95% (St Lawrence). It is notable that the large, low-gradient rivers draining the cratonic
continental interior in cold, semi-arid climates, such as the Ob, Lena and Yenisei in north-
ern Eurasia, and the St Lawrence of Canada, have very high solute loads compared to
particulate loads. In contrast, rivers draining steep topography in regions of active mountain
building with high amounts of orographic rainfall, such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra,
have particulate loads that are far greater than solute loads.
Long-term ﬂuxes of solutes in rivers vary widely with geographic region and therefore
climate (Table 2.7). The tropical zone dominates the world’s run-off and is a major source
of, for example, dissolved silica (Section 3.3) and organic carbon (Section 3.2). The high
level of dissolved silica reﬂects the intensity of chemical weathering processes in tropical
regions, while the large amount of organic carbon is due to the high productivity of tropical
vegetation.
In essence, waters draining catchments made of carbonates (principally limestones and
dolomites) contain high amounts of total dissolved solids (TDS, measured in mg litre−1
or alternatively ppm), particularly Ca2+ and HCO−
3 , but small particulate sediment loads.
Waters draining varied igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary terrains have a correspond-
ingly varied chemical composition and higher particulate loads. We explore the chemistry
of river water in more detail in the chapter on global biogeochemical cycles (Chapter 3)
that follows.
2.4 Chemical Weathering Fluxes Associated with Glaciation
It is expected that chemical weathering rates will be high where physical erosion rates are
high (Gaillardet, Millot, and Dupré, 2003), since physical breakdown increases mineral
surface areas susceptible to chemical attack (Stumm and Morgan, 1996) (Section 9.1).
Temperate-zone, glaciated basins have some of the highest erosion rates on Earth, and
the surface area production rate is high due to the fragmentation of glacial materials into
ﬁne-grained products. However, the ﬂuxes of solutes, particularly silica ﬂuxes, produced

where V is the total volume of material produced by erosion and vg is the volume per grain.
For the case of uniform grain size, such as spheres or cubes, the surface area production
rate becomes
Ps = 6(E/D)A
(2.21)
where E is the erosion rate, D is the particle size and A is the basin area. For a constant basin
size and erosion rate therefore, the surface area production rate varies inversely with mean
grain size. Grain-size reduction of sediment might result from comminution (fragmenta-
tion, Section 9.3) caused by glacial erosion of bedrock. Glacial erosion is likely to be
accelerated under conditions of high mean annual water discharge, as found in temperate-
zone glaciers.
Solute ﬂuxes in both glacierised and non-glacierised catchments show a positive
relationship with speciﬁc annual discharges of water. Whereas total cations data overlap
.003

2.4 Chemical Weathering Fluxes Associated with Glaciation

between glacierised and non-glacierised catchments (Figure 2.22a), data for dissolved
silica show a distinct separation (Figure 2.22b). Low silica ﬂuxes are caused by the
Arrhenius-type effect of temperature on weathering rates. The lack of a differentiation
between glacierised and non-glacierised catchments in terms of total cations is because
much of the cation ﬂux is derived from the weathering of carbonates exposed by glacial
abrasion.
Solute ﬂuxes are also dependent on the mineral weathering reaction rate (mol per
mineral surface area per time): basins with outcropping sedimentary rocks have low silica
concentrations, whereas basins with igneous and metamorphic rocks have high silica
concentrations.

Global Biogeochemical Cycles
3.1 Biogeochemistry of World Rivers
The geochemist Abraham Lerman stated (Lerman, 1988) (p.1) that
A global geochemical cycle is a conceptual model of the pathways and ﬂows of individual chemical
elements and their compounds in the surface environment of the Earth.
A major goal of global biogeochemistry is to understand the transport processes responsible
for these pathways and ﬂows at the present day, to apply this understanding to the past
and to predict the future. The most important pathway is riverine transport from source
areas on the continental surface to the ocean. Rivers are the primary agents responsible for
the ﬂuxes of dissolved solids across the Earth’s surface and therefore participate strongly
in the functioning of biogeochemical cycles (Garrels and Mackenzie, 1971). The solutes
delivered to the world ocean by rivers control its steady-state composition and the nutrient
levels necessary for biological productivity.
Although solutes are derived from the weathering of soil and bedrock, they also origi-
nate from non-denudational sources such as the atmosphere (precipitation, dust and other
aerosols), the mineralisation of organic matter, plant metabolism and man-made pollution.
Solutes from non-denudational sources may make up to half of the total dissolved loads of
rivers.
The most important denudational source of solutes is from weathering of soils, regolith
and bedrock. The different lithologies present in catchments strongly inﬂuence their solute
loads (Table 3.1). Combining typical water analyses of major rock types with their relative
abundance (Table 2.5) allows the solute delivery associated with different rock types to be
evaluated. This can be done globally (Meybeck, 1976, 1987; Gaillardet et al., 1999) or for
individual catchments (Miller, 2002).
In Meybeck’s classic study of the impact of bedrock lithology on river water chemistry
(Meybeck, 1986, 1987), water analyses were derived from small, unpolluted catchments
in France, constituting the Temperate Stream Model. Water chemistry analyses were based
on representative watersheds under different climates with negligible contribution from
oceanic salts, where only one bedrock lithology is present and where the stream is peren-
nial. The French watersheds are generally forested and situated in lowland regions (median

altitude of 650 m) and are relatively small (median drainage area 7.8 km2). The results are
therefore not directly applicable to global patterns of solute generation, but nevertheless
give a useful background on the varied inﬂuence of bedrock lithology on the chemistry of
river waters.
The basis for making the link between bedrock type and water chemistry is the chem-
ical weathering pathways associated with the attack of silicate and carbonate minerals by
carbonic and sulphuric acids generated by the reaction of atmospheric and soil CO2 with
water and by the oxidation of pyrite respectively.
The sources of major elements found in river waters draining to the ocean can be
attributed as follows (Meybeck, 1987):
• Silica and potassium are derived mostly from silicate weathering, which in crystalline
rocks is due to the breakdown of K-micas and orthoclase feldspars
• Sodium, in contrast, has an important source in the weathering of halite, the remaining
Na coming from silicate weathering
• Magnesium originates from dolomites and silicates, with the remainder from Mg-rich
evaporites
• Calcium mainly comes from carbonate weathering, with a subordinate amount from
silicate weathering of sedimentary rocks
• Chloride concentrations are very sensitive to pollution and contamination with ocean
salts; in pristine rivers it derives from halite weathering and less importantly from
crystalline rocks
• Sulphate is derived from the weathering of evaporite sulphate (e.g. gypsum), pyrite and
organic sulphur compounds
• Bicarbonate originates mainly from the atmosphere and secondarily from the chemical
weathering of carbonate rocks.
3.1.1 Global Water Chemistry
On a global basis, the major elements dissolved in river water are in the following order of
abundance (Chester, 1990):
Cl−> SO2−
4
> Ca2+ = Na2+ > Mg2+ > HCO−
3 > SiO2 > K+
The concentrations of major elements are expressed in cumulative form in Figure 3.1.
The two principal water types are those dominated by the cation Ca2+ for fresh water and
the cation Na+ for highly saline waters, and the anion HCO−
3 for fresh water and the anion
Cl−for highly saline waters. The observed differences in the chemical composition of river
water have been investigated in terms of both the chemistry of rainwater and the dissolved
weathering products as a function of the total dissolved solids (TDS).
It has been proposed that water compositions in rivers fall along two diverging arms
when total salinity (expressed as TDS) is plotted against the cationic weight ratio

Na+/(Na++Ca2+) (Figure 3.2) or the anionic weight ratio Cl−/(Cl−+HCO−
3 ) (Gibbs,
1970).
In the scheme proposed by Gibbs (1970), water compositions are controlled by three
main mechanisms (Figure 3.2):
1. Control by precipitation, where the chemistry is dominated by rainwater rich in Na+,
producing a cationic ratio of nearly 1, and low TDS (20–30 mg l−1) since evaporated
seawater falling as rain is dilute. Rivers draining areas of low relief with well-weathered
bedrock, plentiful rainfall and low evaporation are typically controlled by precipitation.
The tropical lowland rivers of Africa and South America, such as the Negro tributary of
the Amazon, fall into this class. The low TDS values may also be affected by the large
biomass of the lowland tropical forests effectively immobilising chemicals from release
into rivers.
2. Control by weathering, where the chemistry of river water is controlled by weath-
ering reactions with soil, regolith and bedrock within their catchments. The cationic
ratio depends on the type of rock being weathered. Limestone bedrocks produce the
lowest cationic ratio. TDS levels are higher than in rivers dominated by precipitation
(30–1,000 mg l−1), reﬂecting the increased role of weathering. Solutes are dominated
by calcium bicarbonate. In the Amazon River system, 85% of the solute load is derived
from a relatively small area of intense weathering in the Andes, whereas the lowland part
of the catchment, particularly that draining the low-relief Brazilian Shield, is dominated
by precipitation. Waters dominated by rock weathering are found in regions of high
weathering intensity and low rates of evaporation.

3. Control by evaporation and crystallisation, common in hot and arid climates where
early precipitation of calcite (CaCO3) increases the cationic ratio due to the relative
concentration of Na+ and Cl−, and evaporative losses of river water increases the TDS
(1,000–2,000 mg l−1). This control produces a series of waters extending from the
Ca-rich rock-weathering end to the Na-rich high-salinity end, typiﬁed by sea water.

3.1 Biogeochemistry of World Rivers
59
A pathway of low to high salinity may occur as a river drains towards the ocean, as in
the case of the Rio Grande, southwest United States and its major tributary, the Pecos
River. Using this approach, river waters dominated by evaporation-cystallisation are
favoured by high weathering intensity combined with high evaporation rates.
The scheme proposed by Gibbs (1970), however, does not account for the impact of
the inﬂow of groundwater brines, as may occur in the Pecos River (New Mexico, United
States), and the dissolution of carbonates and evaporites in the watershed, as may be
important in the case of the Amazon River. The dominance of the control of precipitation in
some Amazonian tributaries has also been questioned (Stallard and Edmond, 1983). Instead
of two diverging arms of water composition suggested by Gibbs (1970) therefore, the major
elements of river waters may depend essentially on different rates of weathering of variable
parent rock types (Meybeck, 1987), so that almost all rivers are weathering-dominated.
Using this approach, river waters may be categorised according to their total ionic contents
based on the climate, relief and bedrock geology:
1. Rivers with relatively low total ionic contents, typical of those draining highly leached
areas of low relief where rainfall is small, as occurs in some tropical regions of South
America and Africa, and in rivers that drain crystalline cratons such as the Canadian,
Brazilian and Congo shields. Waters as dilute as 19 mg l−1 are found in rivers draining
the Canadian Shield.
2. Rivers with intermediate total ionic contents due to increasingly important rock weath-
ering. The water of the Mackenzie River of northwest Canada, which drains a mixture
of sedimentary and crystalline rock types, has a total ionic content of approximately
200 mg l−1 and a ratio of Ca2+/Na+ of 4.7.
3. Rivers with high total ionic contents and high Na/(Na+Ca) ratios. The Colorado River
of southwest United States, for example, has a total ionic content of 200 mg l−1 and
Na concentration close to that of calcium (a Na/(Na+Ca) ratio close to 0.5). In the case
of the Colorado River, the major element chemistry may be strongly inﬂuenced by the
inﬂux of saline groundwater.
The chemical weathering of bedrock, regolith and soil is therefore of paramount
importance in explaining the major element chemistry of river waters. Sedimentary rocks
generate much higher quantities of ions in solution than do the plutonic and high-grade
metamorphic rocks of crystalline shields. Clear relationships between catchment geology
and water chemistry have been demonstrated from a number of large river basins, such
as the Amazon (Stallard and Edmond, 1981, 1983, 1987). Stallard and Edmond analysed
rivers in the Amazon Basin in terms of their total cation content or TZ+ (units of μeq l−1).
Rivers with TZ+ values less than 200 drain intensely weathered materials, and are enriched
in silica relative to other major species, with cation ratios similar to the underlying bedrock.
Rivers with TZ+ values between 200 and 450 μeq l−1 drain siliceous bedrocks (quartzites,
sandstones, felsic volcanics) and are rich in silica relative to other solutes. Rivers with TZ+
values of between 450 and 3,000 μeq l−1 drain sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates,

shales and minor evaporites, with relatively high concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg+, high
alkalinity, and high SO−
4 where rivers drain terrains with reduced shales and sulphate
evaporites such as gypsum. Even higher values of more than 3,000 μeq l−1 are found in
rivers draining giant evaporite successions. Their waters are rich in Na+ and Cl−derived
from highly evolved salt minerals.
The chemistry of river input into the ocean therefore varies from continent to continent,
depending on topography, tectonics, climate and rock types.
3.1.2 Chemistry of the Particulate Load
Solids transported by rivers as suspended particulate load also carry a chemical signa-
ture. Suspended particles reﬂect the mineralogy of the host bedrock, regolith or soil. Clay
minerals of various types are derived directly by fragmentation of the host rock, but the
action of acid hydrolysis of aluminosilicate minerals during chemical weathering causes
an abundance of clay minerals in the sediment loads of many rivers. During progressive
chemical weathering clay minerals are stripped of their metal cations, and eventually of
their silicon and iron, leading to a stable aluminium-rich residue. In areas of less intense
leaching, the cations released by the breakdown of bedrock promote the formation of
cation-bearing clay minerals such as illites and smectites. A large throughput of water is
necessary for advanced stages of leaching, so clay minerals reﬂect in part the climatic
conditions experienced by regolith (Strakhov, 1967):
• In regions of high precipitation rates such as the equatorial and humid tropics, advanced
leaching leads to the formation of gibbsite, kaolinite and aluminium oxides and hydrox-
ides (laterisation). Intense chemical weathering is typical of equatorial-tropical South
America (including the Amazon and Orinoco basins), Africa (including the Congo basin)
and southeast Asia and northeastern Australia.
• In regions of moderate precipitation rates, such as the temperate, peri-humid midlatitudes,
chemical weathering results in the formation of illite and smectite.
• In arid and semi-arid climates, such as the subtropics and the interiors of continental
land masses such as Asia and Australia, low rates of chemical weathering result in
little accumulation of weathering products, which are dominated by carbonate and salt
duricrusts and concretions, and unweathered bedrock.
• The subpolar regions of northern Eurasia and northern North America experience low
temperatures and consequently low rates of chemical weathering. Deep weathering is
possible in regions of minimal local relief.
• Mountainous regions with highly variable rates of chemical weathering, such as the
Alpine-Himalayan chain, typically have relatively little weathering products due to rapid
removal by erosion.
The clay minerals in regolith also depend on depth within the weathering proﬁle
(Strakhov, 1967), since the ﬂux of water decreases with depth towards the bedrock interface

due to decreasing permeability. Residual minerals such as kaolinite and gibbsite are found
near the top of weathering proﬁles, whereas smectite and illite are concentrated near the
base.
The mineralogy of the particulate load of rivers is sensitive to particle size. Quartz and
feldspar grains are mostly greater than 2μm in diameter, whereas mica and clay minerals
are concentrated in the less than 2μm size fraction. Taking the full grain-size range, a
survey of 20 of the world’s major rivers indicates that there are a number of trends in the
chemistry of the particulate loads of rivers (Martin and Meybeck, 1979). Individual river
systems have concentrations of major elements that are fairly uniform, but rivers differ
strongly from one to the other, depending on their history of weathering.
The amount of an element transported in solution as a percentage of the total discharge
(particulate and dissolved) can be expressed by the dissolved transport index DTI (Martin
and Meybeck, 1979). Some elements, on a global scale, are transported almost entirely in
solution (DTI of 50−90%), which includes Na, Ca, Cl and S, whereas others are transported
almost entirely in particulate form (DTI of less than 1%), including Al and Fe (Table
3.2). Those elements with low DTI are prone to deposition along the sediment routing
system, particularly in deltas, and are therefore commonly buried and taken out of the
biogeochemical cycle, whereas elements with high DTI are ﬂushed through the transport
system into the open ocean where they are mixed rapidly.
3.1.3 The Estuarine Filter
River-transported chemical signatures are modiﬁed, or ﬁltered, at the land-sea interface,
particularly in estuaries where seawater is mixed with and diluted by freshwater. Estuaries
act as sediment traps. The estuarine ﬁlter is selective in terms of its impact on differ-
ent elements, some dissolved species being carried quickly out to sea, whereas others
undergo complex reactions that involve exchanges between dissolved, colloidal and partic-
ulate states. Reactions between the dissolved, colloidal and particulate loads are especially
important near the turbidity maximum that occurs at the head of the saltwater intrusion.
Components may be removed from the dissolved phase and transferred to the particulate
phase by ﬂocculation, adsorption, precipitation and biological uptake. Some components
may be added to the dissolved phase by desorption from particle surfaces and breakdown
.004

of organics. Components may be stabilised in the dissolved stage by complexation and
chelation reactions with inorganic and organic ligands. Dissolved chemical species tend to
be ﬂushed out of the estuary into the ocean, whereas particulate species may be retained
within the estuarine sediment trap.
Much of the particulate sediment that enters estuaries and delta-tops from rivers is
trapped and does not enter the ocean on short timescales (Chester, 1990). As examples,
it is estimated that only approximately 8% of the sediment that enters the upper zone
of the Scheldt estuary (northern France, western Belgium and southwestern part of the
Netherlands) is transported to the North Sea. Similarly, more than 90% of the particulate
matter carried by the Mississippi River is deposited in the delta region. About 95% of the
suspended solids of the Amazon River is deposited in river mouth channels and shoals. Of
the particulate sediment transported to its estuary and gulf by the St Lawrence River of
eastern Canada and northeastern United States, approximately 90% is trapped.
3.2 The Fate of Organic Carbon
Sediment routing systems are the sites of oxidation of organic carbon contained in sedimen-
tary rocks undergoing weathering and of the burial of organic carbon in newly deposited
sediments. These are key processes in the global carbon cycle and thereby represent impor-
tant controls on long-term trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen levels, which
mediate global climate (Berner, 1999; Galy et al., 2011). Based on the work of Blair,
Leithold, and Aller (2004), Leithold et al. (2015) (p.33), stated that the sediment routing
system
. . . can be viewed as a network of biogeochemical reactors that facilitate the cycling of organic carbon
and are interconnected by processes of sediment generation, transport and deposition.
Highland reactors comprise bedrock and upland soil, which supply organic carbon to
rivers and lowland stores (such as ﬂoodplains, soils and wetlands). River transport delivers
organic carbon to continental shelf and deep sea reactors. Each reactor is characterised by a
residence time (age) of organic carbon. The bedrock reactor is dominated by long-residence
time fossil C (kerogen), and residence times decrease in the stages toward the deep sea
reactor as younger, more reactive C with terrestrial or marine sources is included in the
cycling of organic carbon. Particulate organic carbon is therefore transmitted through the
sediment routing system, each reservoir receiving inputs from upstream reactors and from
in situ production. A large proportion of the particulate organic carbon in the sediment
routing system is derived from mountain and upland regions.
Continental shelf areas and margins adjacent to major river systems are currently receiv-
ing very high amounts of riverine organic carbon (Ludwig, Probst, and Kempe, 1996;
Leithold, Blair, and Wegmann, 2015). Much of this terrigenous organic matter is buried
close to the river mouth (Keil et al., 1997). The total ﬂux of terrestrial organic carbon
to the world ocean is of the order of 0.1 to 1 × 1012 kg C yr−1, the main repositories
being the deltas of major rivers and adjacent continental shelves, which together store
.004

3.2 The Fate of Organic Carbon
63
0.104 × 1012 kg C yr−1 (Berner, 1989). The largest supplier of terrestrial organic carbon to
the oceans is the Amazon River (31 to 55 × 109 kg TOC yr−1).
The ﬂuxes of solids from the continents to the oceans is critical to the operation of
many biogeochemical cycles, including that of carbon. Yet only a minute proportion of the
net primary production of carbon is exported by rivers, since ca. 99% is oxidised in soils
and returned to the atmosphere as CO2, and at the global scale a further ca. 70% of organic
carbon delivered by rivers is oxidised in the ocean before burial in sediments. Nevertheless,
the burial ﬂux of organic carbon in the world’s sediment routing systems is high enough to
determine, in part, the global budget of CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere to long-
term burial. The most important of such sediment routing systems are those involving
a conveyor belt of high rates of erosion and efﬁcient burial in the ocean. The Ganges–
Brahmaputra system linking Himalayan erosion to deposition in the Bengal Fan accounts
alone for about 15% of the total global burial ﬂux of organic carbon (Galy et al., 2007).
3.2.1 Particulate Organic Carbon
Much carbon is transported in rivers as particulate organic carbon (POC), the bulk of which
is sorbed to the surfaces of suspended mineral material. Consequently, within a range of
organic loading, the amount of organic matter varies in direct proportion to the mineral
surface area (Mayer, 1994). In river water, POC can originate from autochthonous organic
matter production of phytoplankton and from mineralisation of dissolved organic carbon,
and more importantly from allochthonous sources such as biomass, soils and regolith,
or from the atmosphere. The organic matter ranges from small free molecules to large
aggregates and organisms, and is dominated by the size range greater than 0.45 μm.
POC is made up of both living (plankton, bacteria) and non-living (detritus) components.
Refractory compounds have low solubility and resist decay, whereas labile compounds
have high solubility and are used rapidly in aquatic ecosystems. Some 5−35% of the POC
carried in rivers is labile and therefore prone to oxidation (Degens and Ittekot, 1985; Ittekot,
1988), so the remaining more refractory POC dominates the ﬂux into the oceans.
Having entered the sediment routing system, the fate of particulate organic carbon
depends on the physico-chemical and biological processes inﬂuencing mineralisation,
disaggregation and sedimentation. These processes change strongly as the river enters
coastal estuaries and the open ocean. As a result, the average organic loadings of the
Amazon River (0.67 ± 0.14 mg C m−2) are approximately twice that of sediments in the
delta region (ca. 0.35 mg C m−2) (Keil et al., 1997) (Figure 3.3). Allowing for the fact that
two-thirds of organic material in delta sediments is terrestrial in origin, only less than 30%
of the riverine POC supplied by the river is buried in the delta. If this rate is typical of other
river-delta systems, the global loss of POC in the delta regions at river mouths amounts to
approximately 0.1 × 1015 g C yr−1.
The present-day ﬂux of POC is thought to be 0.17−0.30 Gt C yr−1 (Sarmiento and
Sundquist, 1992), or 0.07−0.2 Gt yr−1 (Meybeck, 1982). Using data collected during the

SCOPE (Scientiﬁc Committee on Problems of the Envronment) study, the annual POC
transport to the ocean by rivers with total suspended matter concentrations of 1−1, 500
mg l−1 is 0.19 Gt yr−1 (Ittekot and Laane, 1991). If rivers with total suspended matter
concentrations of greater than 1, 500 mg l−1 are included, the annual ﬁgure becomes 0.23
Gt of particulate carbon. On a global scale, only a small amount of the total ﬂux of carbon
to the ocean is buried in deep sea sediment, which is 0.006 Gt yr−1 (Berner, 1982).
As a percentage of the total suspended matter, POC is generally in the range 1.3−8.4%,
corresponding to concentrations in milligrams of carbon per litre of 0.6−14.2 mg l−1. As
the ﬂux of total suspended matter increases, the concentration of POC increases in concert
as expected, but the POC as a percentage of the total suspended matter decreases (Meybeck,
1982). Wang et al. (2016) found a power law relationship between particulate organic

(3.1)
and
POC = 8.813C1.008
s
(3.2)
where POC is the particulate organic concentration in mg l−1 and Cs is the suspended
sediment concentration in g l−1.
The rate of burial of terrestrial carbon supplied by rivers is considerably larger than
the burial rate of organic carbon from marine biogenic sources (Berner, 1982). Particulate
carbon delivered to the continental slope and deep ocean is extracted from the short-term
carbon cycle and preserved for long timescales within marine sediment. Approximately
two-thirds of particulate solids delivered to the ocean by rivers is transported beyond the
shelf-edge of continental margin clinoforms (Petter et al., 2013) (Chapter 5). As a ﬁrst
approximation, it is expected that the deposition rate of POC is directly related to the depo-
sitional ﬂux of sediment. Consequently, the deposition rate of POC in the ocean beyond the
shelf edge is likely to be 0.11−0.20 Gt C yr−1. Deep water storage of carbon is likely to
be most important where deltas of major rivers are close to the shelf edge, in other words,
where the shelf width is small and indented deeply by canyons (Section 6.2).
3.2.2 Dissolved Organic Carbon
Carbon is also transported to the ocean as inorganic carbon dissolved in river water. The
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in river waters at the present day comes from three main
sources: soils, in which the organic matter is derived from plant and animal material via
microbial activity, ﬂuvial production and anthropogenic inputs. DOC therefore originates
from both aquatic and terrestrial sources. Between 40 and 80% of ﬂuvial DOC consists of
combined humic substances regarded as refractory and consequently capable of avoiding
degradation en route to the ocean. The autochthonous production of carbon includes labile
(easily metabolised) biochemical material that is degraded in the river or estuarine system
and does not escape into the ocean. The weighted global average river water concentration
of DOC is 5.75 mg l−1 (Ertel et al. 1986), but there are strong variations between rivers
draining different environments.
The relationship between DOC and POC appears to depend on the ﬂux of total sus-
pended matter. Values of the ratio DOC/POC are higher in rivers with low suspended matter
concentrations and lower in rivers with high total suspended matter concentrations (Table
3.3). Most rivers carry much more DOC than POC, up to a ratio of about 10. The major
rivers that drain the Himalayan mountain range (Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy)
together account for about one-third of the global delivery of suspended sediment to the
ocean (Table 3.4). The equivalent transport of particulate organic carbon by these rivers

the total carbon ﬂux annually is 0.069 Gt, which constitutes a large percentage of the
global total.
3.2.3 Burial of Organic Carbon and Global Climate
The burial of organic carbon in marine sediments is the second largest sink of atmospheric
CO2, after silicate weathering coupled with carbonate precipitation in the ocean. Yet the
delivery of organic carbon to the ocean as a result of erosion of the continental land surface,
and its burial in marine sediment, is complex for a number of reasons:
1. The organic carbon carried by rivers is composed of both recent organic matter and
fossil refractory carbon derived by erosion of carbon-rich sedimentary rocks. Burial of
fossil refractory carbon has no effect on the long-term carbon cycle.

2. A large proportion (about 70%) of the carbon exported into the ocean from the conti-
nents is oxidised on the continental shelf and returned to the atmosphere.
3. Measurement of the organic carbon ﬂuxes of rivers is made difﬁcult by the segregation
of particles during transport.
It is evident from Table 3.4 that rivers draining the Himalayan mountains export billions
of tons of sediment, some of which is buried in the deep-water Bengal Fan (Curray, Emmel,
and Moore, 2002). Over the past 15 Myr approximately 15% of the global burial ﬂux of
carbon has been sequestered in the sediments of the Bengal Fan (France-Lanord and Derry,
1997). Understanding the Himalayan-Bengal sediment routing system, and others like it, is
therefore critical to assessment of the role of the carbon cycle in global climate.
All sediments in the Ganges–Brahmaputra river system have a positive correlation
between TOC and the Al/Si ratio (Figure 3.4), which expresses a covariation of TOC with
grain size and mineralogy, since Al is concentrated in ﬁne-grained minerals such as clays.
An identical relationship is found in sediments of the Bengal Fan, suggesting that the loads
of organic carbon in river and submarine fan sediments are identical. Both ﬂuvial and

and 20−25% is Cinorg. The organic carbon is 70% terrestrial in origin and 30% is marine, whereas
the inorganic carbon has a reciprocal relationship; it is dominated by marine (70%) compared to
terrestrial (30%). Numbers in italics and solid arrows refer to ﬂuxes with entirely terrestrial sources;

fan sediments are also dominated by terrestrial carbon. The Bengal Fan therefore seems
to efﬁciently preserve and bury terrestrial carbon provided by the Ganges–Brahmaputra
system, as opposed to the much lower burial efﬁciency of other examples, such as the
Amazon (Figure 3.5). Oxidation of organic carbon is limited by rapid transport and
burial and low availability of O2 in the stratiﬁed waters of the Bay of Bengal, whereas
decomposition of organic carbon on the sea bed in water depths of 10–40 m is important
on the Amazon shelf. The Amazon shelf and deep sea fan therefore contrast strongly with
the Bengal Fan as a carbon sink.
Most tropical shelves, such as that of the Amazon, act as organic carbon incinerators,
burning off nearly all the organic matter supplied by rivers, estuaries and oceanic waters,
.004

with minimal preservation by burial in sediments. Inorganic carbon in carbonate is drawn
down in coral reef building, but almost all biogenic CaCO3 in ocean waters is dissolved
and recycled below the calcite and aragonite compensation depths. Although operating as
incinerators at the present day, tropical shelves have been sites of proliﬁc burial of carbon
at times when oxygen levels were low.
While it may be true that deltas and continental margins are the main storage reservoirs
for organic matter and most terrestrial weathering products (Berner, 1982), continental
margins are also sites of much enhanced biological respiration, microbial decomposition
and redox cycling of the elements, especially those of the tropics, where temperatures are
high and plentiful nutrient and light levels favour microbial processes. If so, many tropical
margins may be carbon neutral or net sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Nev-
ertheless, sites where major rivers such as the Amazon and Ganges–Brahmaputra debouch
into the ocean are carbon sinks. Sustained high carbon ﬁxation on continental shelves may
require N and P sources, for instance from oceanic upwelling combined with high sediment
burial rates (Section 3.3).
3.2.4 Organic Carbon in the Amazon Sediment Routing System
The best documented sediment routing system in terms of the fate of organic carbon is that
of the Amazon. Each year the Amazon River transports about 1.2 × 109 tons of suspended
sedimentary material to its lower reaches (Meade et al., 1985). Of this amount, roughly
half accumulates in the coastal waters of the subaqueous delta where it builds seaward-
prograding clinoforms. The impact of this sediment delivery on biogeochemical cycling is
determined in large part by the diagenetic reactions and sediment-water exchange processes
taking place at shallow depths in the sediment pile. The early diagenetic processes taking
place on the Amazon shelf are typically dominated by Fe and Mn reduction/cycling, in
contrast to other tropical deltas where the cycling of S is dominant.
Turbidity limits biological productivity nearshore, while depletion of nutrients limits it
offshore, so productivity in restricted to an intermediate zone marked by its green colour,
compared with the brown nearshore waters and the blue offshore waters. Sustained primary
production is highest in water depths of 40–80 m northwest of the Amazon River mouth.
Average grain size decreases seaward and along-shelf. Sediments of the shelf are intensely
reworked and homogenised by strong tidal currents and waves. Away from and seaward of
this high energy corridor, the extent of bioturbation is the dominant inﬂuence on diagenetic
processes in the sediment beneath the sea bed.
Despite the very high input of sediment from the Amazon River and a total organic
carbon percentage of only 0.6−0.8%, surﬁcial sediments on the inner shelf have CO2
remineralisation rates that are comparable to other nearshore regions with much higher
organic carbon content. Sea bed sediments are diagenetically highly reactive, leading to
high CO2 production and the formation of authigenic minerals such as carbonates. Rela-
tive to the primary productivity of organic carbon in the water column above the subaqueous

delta, the proportion remineralised in bottom sediments is 20−30%, which is typical to
the proportions found in many other estuarine and shelf environments. Terrestrial organic
carbon inputs also contribute to the remineralisation of sea bed sediments on the Amazon
shelf.
The generation of organic carbon in the water column by phytoplankton production
increases seaward away from the turbid Amazon plume to maximum values in water depths
of 50−70 m. However, this trend in phytoplankton productivity is not mirrored by reminer-
alisation rates in surﬁcial sediments, which show little variation over water depth ranges of
10–40 m, despite the fact that most of the remineralised organic matter in bottom sediments
is of marine origin. This is most likely a result of cross-shelf transport and homogenisation
of sea bed particles. There is ample evidence of cross-shelf tidal currents and estuarine
circulation (Kuehl, DeMaster, and Nittrouer, 1986) to achieve this homogenisation.
Part of the particulate and remineralised organic carbon is recycled into the water
column, or lost from the shelf, but the remainder is buried within the sediments of the
Amazon delta. There is a net diagenetic conversion of remineralised organic carbon
to precipitated inorganic carbon within and below the surface mixed layer of sedi-
ment, leading to a relatively constant rate of burial of total organic carbon of 0.70%
(Figure 3.5). Much of the inorganic carbon in Amazon shelf sediments is FeCO3 (siderite).
The anoxic diagenetic reaction affecting remineralised carbon storage by the formation of
siderite is:
4Fe(OH)3 + Corg + 3H2CO3 →4FeCO3 + 9H2O
Assuming an annual sediment accumulation on the Amazon shelf of approximately
0.63 ± 0.2 ×109 tons (Kuehl et al., 1986), and a percentage total carbon content of sediment
derived from piston cores of 0.79%, then 5 × 109 kg yr−1 of total carbon must be buried,
of which 25−30% is derived from remineralised inorganic carbon having a predominantly
marine origin (Aller et al., 1996) (Figure 3.5). On the basis of the carbon isotopic values
of surface sediment over most of the subaqueous delta, 70−80% of the organic carbon has
a terrestrial origin. On average, less than 10% of the CO2 remineralised from marine
organic carbon is buried, so more than 90% must be eventually recycled into the water
column.
The Amazon River brings 14 × 109 kg yr−1 of particulate organic carbon (POC) and
22 × 109 kg yr−1 of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to its lower reaches. The bulk of
this POC and DOC is refractory under riverine conditions (Hedges et al., 1986), that is,
it is essentially inert. Assuming that most DOC transits the shelf or is remineralised and
that POC is not strongly fractionated from other sedimentary particles, then approximately
half of the particulate ﬂux of riverine POC should be deposited in Brazilian shelf waters,
with a proportion of Corg of 1.2% POC inherited from the terrestrial carbon in river water.
However, the proportion of terrestrial POC in shelf muds is on average 0.4%, indicating a
substantial loss of 60−70%. A large percentage of the refractory terrestrial organic carbon
is most likely remineralised or lost on the shelf due to oxidation (degradation).

3.2.5 Organic Carbon through Glacial-Interglacial Cycles
The ﬂuxes between reservoirs in the carbon cycle vary signiﬁcantly in response to global
environmental change, such as, for example, the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quater-
nary. Relative to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) approximately 18 kyr ago, the present
interglacial phase in pre-industrial times is characterised by higher ﬂuxes of carbon dioxide
from the surface ocean layer (euphotic zone) to the atmosphere, its uptake by land biomass
and humus, CO2 consumption during weathering of rocks, and transport of inorganic and
organic carbon in rivers draining the continental land mass.
It has previously been noted that only a small fraction of the organic carbon contributed
to the ocean by rivers makes its way to the deep sea fans at the termini of sediment
routing systems. This fraction may vary over time, particularly as a result of climate and
sea level forcing associated with glacial-interglacial cycles (Schlünz et al., 1999) (Figure
3.6). Sediment supply to the deep sea Amazon Fan, together with its fraction of terrestrial
organic carbon, changed dramatically at times of sea level change (Figure 3.7). At times of
interglacial highstand, such as the present day, the organic carbon buried on the fan surface
is dominated by marine sources. During glacial sea level lowstands, when the continental
shelf was incised and Amazon River sediment was transported directly via a canyon to the
deep sea fan, the organic carbon accumulating on the fan was almost entirely terrigenous,
representing 7−12% of the modern terrestrial organic carbon input from the Amazon River.
The Amazon Fan extends 700 km seawards to water depths of 4,800 m in the Demerara
Abyssal Plain. The last glacial-interglacial cycle can be recognised in fan sediment by a
change from light brown pteropod-foraminifera marl in the top 50–120 cm, underlain by
a black, organic-rich mud deposited during the last glacial phase. Carbon isotope ratios of
organic matter show a change from a terrigenous supply during the last glacial to marine
phytoplankton production during the Holocene (Showers and Bevis, 1988). Carbon isotope
ratios δCorg from piston cores recovering glacial phase sediments are very similar to Ama-
zon river and river mouth values of POC whereas Holocene values are close to ratios found
in continental shelf waters. Schlünz et al. (1999) estimate that during glacial conditions,
60−90% of the organic carbon in Amazon Fan sediments is terrestrial in origin, whereas
during the Holocene, up to 100% of the organic carbon is marine. This sedimentological
and carbon isotopic pattern is also found in older glacial-interglacial cycles sampled in
cores.
The alternations seen in cores indicates rapid switchovers between glacial and inter-
glacial phases. The rapid and massive input of terrigeneous organic carbon heralding the
glacial phase may be due to erosion of sediment deposited in continental shelf depths before
the Amazon River directly contributed riverine Corg. Any autochthonous marine production
would have been swamped by the terrigenous input during glacials. During sea level rise
in the following interglacial, organic matter deposited on the fan was quickly replaced by
autochthonous marine material (Figure 3.6). During interglacial sea level highstands such
as the present-day, terrigenous organic matter supplied by the Amazon River is transported
northwestwards as the river plume is diverted by the North Brazil Coastal Current.

organic carbon on the shelf are from Richey et al. (1980) and Showers and Angle (1986). (b) During
glacial lowstand periods, terrestrial organic carbon is discharged directly across the exposed shelf and

Marine organic carbon accumulation rates were highest during the interglacial isotope
stages 1 and 5 (0.1 and 0.17 g C m−2 yr−1) respectively (Figure 3.7), with minimal con-
tribution by terrestrial sources to the TOC. During glacial phases, the accumulation rate
of terrigenous organic carbon varies according to position on the fan, being highest (up to
150 g C m−2 yr−1) close to the main submarine channels and levee systems.

The discharge of organic carbon by the River Amazon ranges between 31 and 54.8 ×
1012 g Corg yr−1, which if constant over time would amount to 0.62 to 1.1×1018 g of terres-
trial organic carbon over 20 kyr (15–35 ka). This implies that only 7−12% of the terrestrial
organic carbon delivered to the river mouth accumulated on the Amazon Fan. However, the
estimated accumulation rate of terrestrial organic carbon on the fan over 20 kyr (equivalent
to 3.7 × 1012 g yr−1 of terrestrial organic carbon) is of the same order as the magnitude of
the accumulation rate of terrestrial organic carbon on the Amazon continental shelf today
(3.1 × 1012 g C yr−1), which is 6−10% of the riverine discharge. Although this represents
a rather inefﬁcient burial rate of terrestrial carbon, the time-integrated burial over 20 kyr
from this single, albeit large, river system is a signiﬁcant fraction (ca. 10%) of the entire
atmospheric store of carbon. Viewed at a global scale, the loss of organic matter derived
from the continents by burial in deltas, continental shelves and deep sea fans worldwide in
just 6,000 years represents the entire store of atmospheric carbon.
3.2.6 Particulate Organic Carbon at Active and Passive Margins
The organic carbon composition varies according to the ﬂuxes involved in the various
reservoirs or reactors in the sediment routing system. In mountainous regions, sediment
is delivered by hillslopes to channel networks, and the same processes transport particulate
organic carbon from sources as above-ground biomass as well as soils and sedimentary
rocks. Near-surface litter and above-ground biomass tends to be more labile (reactive) than
the older organic matter in deeper soil horizons and in sedimentary rocks. The relative
importance of these sources and processes therefore controls the amount and character of
organic matter transported through headwater streams. The fraction of particulate organic
carbon in total riverine suspended solids (TSS) decreases with increasing TSS concentra-
tions (Figure 3.8), signifying that major erosional events excavate organic carbon-poor,
deeper soil horizons and sedimentary bedrock. Consequently, there is a clear relationship
between the radiocarbon age of particulate organic matter and the catchment-averaged
sediment yield for a range of the world’s rivers (Figure 3.9).
Highly erosive events in steep, wet mountainous catchments are responsible for a dispro-
portionately large fraction of the total sediment and particulate organic carbon ﬂuxes, as in
the Li-Wu catchment of Taiwan (Hilton et al., 2008). Where bedrocks are competent, slopes
are moderate and vegetation is thick, high POC ﬂuxes are principally derived from recent
biomass, but in steep catchments with less competent bedrocks, such as in the Southern
Alps of New Zealand, debris ﬂows and landslides deliver organic carbon from deeper
soil horizons and from bedrock. In such cases, ﬂuxes of biospheric organic carbon are
much smaller than those of petrogenic (fossil) organic carbon. Some petrogenic carbon is
oxidised at source during weathering, releasing CO2, the remainder being transported to
lower reaches of the sediment routing system.
Sediment and POC leaving mountainous headwater regions is delivered to low-gradient
river systems with variable sizes of ﬂoodplains that act as traps. Small, steep rivers at

active plate margins have small ﬂoodplains providing minimal possibilities for the stor-
age of sediment and POC. The transit time of particulates through the river system is
rapid, so organic carbon is negligibly degraded. Large, low-gradient rivers ﬂowing from
mountainous source regions across extensive cratonic and foreland basins, however, have
widespread, ﬂat, ﬂoodplains, where sediments and POC undergo cycles of erosion and
deposition over long periods of storage. Sediment and POC is deposited on ﬂoodplains and

Fmod of close to 0, and aged-soil has intermediate values. Consequently, the trend indicates that with

bedrock. From Leithold, Blair, and Wegmann (2015) (ﬁg.5, p.35) with permission of Elsevier.
in ﬂoodplain lakes and abandoned channels during ﬂoods and subsequently decomposed
and aged. Although new biospheric organic carbon is added to the ﬂoodplain reservoir dur-
ing subsequent ﬂoods, repeated cycles of ﬂooding, deposition and erosion cause the mate-
rial entering the ocean to be signiﬁcantly aged, mean radiocarbon ages of 103−104 yr being
common at the mouths of large catchments such as the Amazon, Ganges–Brahmaputra,
Yenesei and Lena.
The organic carbon of the continental shelf is partly degraded and oxidised. Shelves with
low oxygen levels have high efﬁciencies of carbon burial, whereas in normal shelf waters,
there is a positive relationship between burial efﬁciency and sediment accumulation rate
(Figure 3.10). Sediment accumulation on the continental shelf depends on the supply rate,
mostly from nearby river mouths, shelf accommodation driven by thermal subsidence, and
sediment redistribution by waves, tides, plume outﬂows and gravity currents (Walsh and
Nittrouer, 2007). Sediment redistribution is particularly important on the narrow shelves
off small mountainous rivers, where sediment is advected to depocentres on the mid and

outer shelf, continental slope and deep sea. Particulate organic carbon is therefore rapidly
and efﬁciently buried on active margins. The Waiapu shelf, off North Island, New Zealand,
for example, experiences burial efﬁciencies of about 90% of riverine carbon in a mid-shelf
depocentre (Blair and Aller, 2012).
In contrast, continental shelves are relatively wide along passive margins. Commonly,
large rivers deliver enormous quantities of sediment to the ocean, constructing thick sed-
iment prisms built internally of clinoforms. The burial efﬁciency of organic carbon is
variable in such systems. In the clinoform topset region, repeated resuspension of ﬁne
grained sediments produces dense suspensions known as ﬂuid muds, in which much of
the terrestrial organic carbon and locally produced marine organic carbon is lost by rem-
ineralisation. In other locations where sediment accumulation rates are high, degradational
losses of terrestrial organic carbon may be minimal.
Sediment and organic carbon is also ﬂuxed from continental shelves into the deeper
sea by nepheloid layers, cascades of dense water, and gravity-driven slides, slumps, debris
ﬂows and turbidity currents. Burial efﬁciencies of organic carbon are low where sediment
inﬂuxes are highly infrequent, sedimentation rates are low and exposure to oxygenated
water and pore ﬂuid prolonged, as in the Madeira Abyssal Plain of the deep (5,400 m)

Global Biogeochemical Cycles
eastern Atlantic Ocean. Where turbidite activity is more frequent and accumulation rates
are higher, as in proximal fan settings fed by river ﬂood discharges, organic carbon burial
is more efﬁcient.
Active and passive margins differ in their dynamics of delivery of sediment and organic
carbon to the deep sea. On active margins, submarine canyon heads commonly incise
deeply into the continental shelf close to river entry points (Section 6.2), so terrestrial
OC is rapidly transferred to the deep sea. The Eel River and Canyon is a good example
(Puig et al., 2004). On passive margins, sediment and terrestrial organic carbon is typically
stored for long periods on the continental shelf at times of sea level highstand such as the
present day. In some cases, however, canyons incise deeply into the continental shelves
of passive margins, eroding previously deposited, consolidated sediments of the upper
continental slope containing aged terrestrial organic carbon (Tesi et al., 2010). In other
cases, canyons funnel ﬂuvial sediment and terrestrial organic carbon to deep sea fans by
bypassing the shelf segment entirely, as in the Mississippi and Ganges–Brahmaputra sys-
tems. Consequently, the organic carbon in the Bengal Fan is almost identical to that of the
lower reaches of the river system (Galy et al., 2007). The resulting exceptionally high burial
efﬁciency of organic carbon on the Bengal Fan, which is close to 100%, is caused by rapid
accumulation rates combined with low oxygen concentrations in the waters of the Bay of
Bengal.
3.3 Nutrient Fluxes
By far the greatest species diversity and most vigorous biogeochemical cycling takes place
in the relatively shallow waters of the world’s ocean margins, particularly those of the
tropics, in part at least due to the input of high amounts of dissolved and particulate loads
from rivers. The river loads include nutrients that limit biological productivity. In addition,
oceanic water is advected onto the continental shelf at levels of tens to hundreds times the
river input, where it is scavenged of elements by riverine particles and resuspended shelf
sediments. Major bio-limiting nutrients carried in river waters are carbon, nitrogen and
phosphorus. The C-N-P system is easily perturbed by human activity. Anthropogenic inﬂu-
ences have caused an increase in the delivery of C, N and P to coastal waters, particularly
since the mid-1900s.
Dissolved silica can be taken as an illustration of the role of the sediment routing system
in the operation of global biogeochemical cycles. A brief introduction is provided here,
and more comprehensive and detailed analysis can be found in Beusen et al. (2009), Dürr
et al. (2009) and Bernard et al. (2010). Although the study of the chemistry of river waters
draining different bedrock lithologies shows wide variations of the major anions and cations
(Section 3.1), levels of dissolved silica appear to be independent of bedrock lithology,
with the exception of rivers draining volcanic rocks and soils, as in Iceland (Meybeck and
Ragu, 1996). Dissolved silica has therefore been used to estimate chemical denudation rates
since its variation is independent of catchment area geology. The fact that dissolved silica

Figure 3.11 Discharge by rivers of dissolved silica to the global coastal ocean, using data in Meybeck
and Ragu (1996). The total annual discharge of dissolved silica is 330×106 t yr−1. River entry points

discharges and yields are very high in rivers in tropical, wet, tectonically active settings
supports this view. The high-rainfall tropical rivers of southern Asia and Oceania account
for 60% of the chemical weathering in watersheds draining into the global ocean. As a
result there are strong regional variations in the dissolved silica ﬂuxes to the coastal ocean
(Figure 3.11).
Since silica is a nutrient, these regional variations contribute to the patterns of biological
primary production in continental shelf seas. Dissolved silica is particularly important
for the growth of diatoms, which form a large part of the phytoplankton biomass. The
delivery of dissolved silica to the coastal ocean is therefore important in the carbon cycle
and forms a critical part of the marine food web. Delivery of riverine dissolved silica and
uptake of dissolved silica by diatoms is compensated for by the burial of biogenic silica
(opal) in seabed sediments. Shallow continental shelves shorten the sink time of biogenic
opal, preventing dissolution before reaching the sea bed, and promoting its storage on the
continental shelf for long time periods. In deep continental shelf waters, and in the open
ocean, the sink time is long and dissolution is more signiﬁcant.
Hotspots in nutrient concentration are related to major river inputs, such as the Amazon
plume, the Arctic, where rivers have high ratios of dissolved to particulate solids, and areas
where human activity (crop fertilisation, urban sewage) has caused large increases in the
release of nutrients, such as in southeast Asia (Dürr et al., 2009). Continental shelves are the

sites of much-enhanced primary production, making up 25% of global ocean production,
yet occupying just 8% of the ocean surface (Ver, Mackenzie, and Lerman, 1999).
Global biogeochemical ocean general circulation models are available that couple river-
ine nutrient supply to productivity, ocean dynamics and sedimentation (e.g. Bernard et al.
(2011)). Models can be used to assess the effects of riverine dissolved silica input on
the concentration of silicic acid in surface waters (μmol l−1). A map of the computed
difference in [dSi] due to riverine inputs reveals four major hotspots – the Arctic Ocean,
eastern Gulf of Guinea (west Africa), Amazon plume and southeast Asia.
Input of riverine dissolved silica increases concentrations in continental shelf waters,
whereas use by phytoplankton decreases concentrations, and silica is exported from the
euphotic zone as biogenic opal. Hotspots of riverine silica input are generally in areas
of high organic productivity, for two reasons: (1) productivity is high because of nutrient
availability directly from the river input, as in the case of the Amazon plume, and (2)
productivity is high due to the combining of riverine input and local upwelling of nutrients,
as in the southwest coast of Africa or the southwest coast of United States–Mexico.
The silica cycle is likely to be signiﬁcantly perturbed by climate change. Precipitation
and temperature control the rate of chemical weathering of the continents and thereby the
dissolved silica ﬂux of rivers. Climate also controls wind circulation patterns and thereby
upwelling of nutrient-rich waters along continental margins. The combination of river input
and upwelling therefore is sensitive to global climate change.

The Catchment-Fluvial Segment
Sediment routing systems consist of one or more morphodynamic zones within which
a coherent set of sediment transport processes operate. These morphodynamic zones, or
segments, are genetically related and dynamically connected, since sediment is transferred
across their boundaries in a cascade from source to sink. Sømme et al. (2009) proposed a
framework where source-to-sink systems may comprise up to three segments:
1. Catchment-ﬂuvial segment, which includes the source region of sediment and the river
system connecting the catchment to the ocean, lake or endorheic basin. The morphology
and dynamics of this segment are characterised by parameters describing the catchment
area, the maximum elevation of the headwaters, the length of the main catchment trunk
stream, the water discharge and the sediment load, all of which are impacted by tectonic
history of uplift and subsidence, climate, vegetation and bedrock lithologies. Some areas
acting as sediment sources may be glaciated. The sediment released from ice sheets and
valley glaciers varies according to thermal regime. Sediment is dispersed at the base,
within and above the ice mass, as well as by icebergs, and is commonly reworked on the
continental shelf and transported to the deep sea by gravity ﬂow processes.
2. Continental shelf segment, which is separated from the ﬂuvial sediment conveyor by
the complex dynamics of the coast and is highly susceptible to changes in sea level.
Processes on the shelf determine sediment storage potential and the export of particulate
sediment to the deep sea. Shelves vary in their width, slope and water depth at the shelf-
slope break, the extent to which canyons incise towards the coast, and the complex
dynamics of river plumes, waves, tides and geostrophic ﬂows in driving sediment trans-
port.
3. Deep marine segment, comprising the continental slope and deep basin ﬂoor. The con-
tinental slope is the fully subaqueous, overall progradational slope constructed from the
spilling over the shelf of primarily suspended sediment. The continental slope varies
in bathymetric gradient, slope length and amplitude, dependent on the distribution of
tectonic subsidence and sediment supply. The basin ﬂoor is the absorbing state in deep
water, receiving sediment primarily from gravity-driven debris ﬂows and turbidity cur-
rents travelling down canyons incised into the continental slope and from deep ocean
currents in the form of contourite drifts. The amount of sediment bypassing the shelf en
route to the deep sea varies strongly from close to nil to more than 90%.

The Catchment-Fluvial Segment
The catchment-ﬂuvial segment contains morphological elements of hillslopes and
bedrock channels, basin-margin fans at catchment outlets, and alluvial river systems with
their ﬂoodplains and lakes. The catchment-ﬂuvial segment acts both like a ﬁre hose
delivering sediment to the ocean and also like a sponge storing sediment in alluvial
ﬂoodplains and lakes.
The majority of the land surface of the Earth is composed of areas that are experi-
encing net erosion over the long term. As a result, these areas have no potential for the
preservation of stratigraphy. Areas experiencing net subsidence over long timescales, that
is, sedimentary basins, comprise only 16% of the Earth’s terrestrial land surface (Nyberg
and Howell, 2015). Furthermore, 60% of the area of modern sedimentary basins has an arid
climate, compared to 27% of the Earth’s land surface, implying that sediments deposited
in dry climates are over-represented in the stratigraphic record relative to their occurrence
on the present-day Earth’s surface. Whereas river systems in areas experiencing net erosion
commonly show a tributive channel pattern, those in terrestrial sedimentary basins without
marine inﬂuence are commonly distributive. Distributive ﬂuvial systems commonly show
a downstream decrease in channel size, are unconﬁned in their alluvial tract and over
time build a radial depositional pattern from a distinct apex (Weissmann et al., 2010)
(Figure 4.1). The apex of distributive systems is generally at the exit point of a river from a
conﬁned, highland valley.
Foreland basins, which contain sediments derived from a bordering mountain belt
deposited in a ﬂexural depression (DeCelles and Giles, 1996; Allen and Allen, 2013),
contain very large distributive systems. For instance, the Pilcomayo ﬂuvial system of
the Andean retro-foreland basin in Bolivia and Argentina is more than 700 km long.
Distributive ﬂuvial systems greater than 103 km2 in area are termed megafans (Geddes,
1960; DeCelles and Cavazza, 1999). Smaller alluvial fans commonly ﬁll in the area
between megafans along the basin edge (Figure 4.1). Distributive ﬂuvial systems also
dominate wedge-top (piggyback) basins, but they are smaller than in foredeeps. In wedge-
top settings, alluvial fans, supplied with sediment by bordering thrust-related anticlines,
dominate the sedimentary basins, and commonly pass downstream into axial river systems
and playas.
Extensional fault block basins (Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000), such as those of the Basin
and Range province in the United States, are occupied by distributive ﬂuvial systems in the
form of debris-ﬂow and streamﬂood-dominated basin-margin fans, with playas, perennial
lakes and braided axial rivers in the deepest part of the hangingwall basin. The position of
the axial river or playa depends on the sediment inﬂuxes and tectonic accommodation on
the two opposing sides of the extensional basin (Kim et al., 2011; Connell et al., 2012;
Allen and Allen, 2013). A similar arrangement of ﬂuvial elements is found in strike-
slip basins, their horizontal scale being controlled by the amount of offset of the main
fault strands.
One of the most important arrangements of ﬂuvial elements therefore is the deposi-
tion of transverse, distributive fans along basin edges together with an axial trunk stream
(Figure 4.1). The ﬂow paths of river systems are controlled by the regional topographic

slopes set up by tectonic uplift and subsidence and by the sediment supply from the basin
margins. The arrangement of ﬂuvial elements is commonly asymmetrical. In extensional
half-graben, sediment is commonly supplied transversely from rapidly uplifting footwalls
and slowly rotating hangingwalls. In foreland basins, the transverse supply is predomi-
nantly from the orogenic wedge (Sinclair et al., 1991; Sinclair, 2012) and to a lesser extent
from the ﬂexural forebulge (Crampton and Allen, 1995). In the wedge-top region, sediment
may be shed backwards from growing contractional folds and thrust culminations.
Uplifting footwall blocks are typically fringed by coalesced alluvial fans (Whipple and
Trayler, 1996; Allen and Hovius, 1998; Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000), as is classically
seen in the arid basins of the southwest Basin and Range province. Progradation or
retrogradation of the coalesced fans is determined by the mass balance of sediment supply
and accommodation. It is also inﬂuenced in some cases by erosion at the toes of the fans by
incising axial rivers, a process known as toe-cutting, which boosts the sediment discharge
of the axial system (Leeder and Mack, 2001). Toe-cutting represents a different distal
boundary condition in numerical models of fan development (Pépin et al., 2010) to those
involving a closed fan budget (Allen and Densmore, 2000; Densmore et al., 2007a).
Sediment dispersal patterns away from contractional orogens are strongly affected by
the balance between the sediment supply qs and the distribution of accommodation σ(x)
(Allen et al., 2013). Where this ratio is low, steep depositional systems such as fan deltas
build into underﬁlled lacustrine or marine basins. At intermediate values of qs/σ(x), larger
depositional systems ﬁll structurally conﬁned basins, but sediment dispersal is guided by

tectonic structures into an axial ﬂow. At higher values of the ratio, large transverse megafans
bury defunct structures and follow the regional palaeoslope from the mountain belt to the
ﬂexural foredeep.
Sedimentary basins may evolve in their tectonic subsidence and sediment discharge in
a predictable fashion. For example, an extensional basin may evolve from an initiation
stage with a number of independent faults with small offset, to a stage of interaction and
linkage, to a through-going fault stage, accompanied with increasing subsidence rate and
increasing surface topography (Cowie et al., 2006). A foreland basin commonly evolves
from an underﬁlled foredeep and wedge-top basins, to a wider overﬁlled basin associ-
ated with high sediment discharges from the orogen (Covey, 1986; Sinclair and Allen,
1992; Allen and Allen, 2013). The temporal evolution of basin-margin fans and axial
systems, therefore, responds to changing patterns of sediment discharge and accommoda-
tion. An increase in tectonic subsidence rate in an extensional basin causes a shrinkage
of footwall-generated fans, a widening of the axial ﬂuvial belt and underﬁlling. Later
overﬁlling, as sediment discharge ‘catches up’ with accommodation generation, causes fan
progradation and export of large sediment discharges down-system (Allen and Allen, 2013)
(appendix 49, pp.543–544).
4.1 Hillslopes and Bedrock Channels
Looking down on the upland landscapes of the Earth’s surface from an airplane, particularly
in dry regions where vegetation is nearly absent, one is struck by its repeated patterns and its
crenulations. These patterns, produced by the erosion of water, comprise channel networks
that are typically dendritic. Drainage networks comprise the ‘erosional engines’ (Whittaker,
Attal, and Allen, 2010) or ‘clastic factories’ (Leeder, 1999) of the landscape, acting as
source regions where sediment is formed and conveying it to sedimentary basins as part
of a sediment cascade. Dendritic channel networks involve a hierarchical order of stream
segments (Horton, 1945; Strahler, 1952). The drainage density Dd of a channel network is
the total length of channels L per unit area of drainage basin A and can be deﬁned as
Dd = n
i=1Li
A
(4.1)
where i is the number of channels. High drainage densities imply short hillslope lengths,
while the reverse is true of low drainage densities. Since hillslopes transmit water slowly
compared to channellised ﬂows, short hillslopes cause ﬂood events to be quickly registered
downstream, as in the badlands landscapes of dry regions experiencing ﬂashy rainfall
events.
4.1.1 Outlet Spacing of Transverse Drainage Basins
The upstream limit of a drainage basin is marked by a channel head region. The location
of channel heads, which may be initiated by landsliding (Montgomery and Dietrich, 1988,
1992) or seepage erosion (‘sapping’) (Abrams et al., 2009) sets the drainage density of

a landscape. The spacing of channel heads inﬂuences the lateral length scale of the
drainage basin and thereby, in some instances, the lateral spacing of sediment entry
points into sedimentary basins. River entry points are generally the apices of depositional
systems.
The spacing of outlets (S) of transverse catchments along a range front has been
observed to be approximately half of the distance between the main drainage divide and
the range front (W) (Wallace, 1978; Adams, 1985; Hovius, 1996; Talling et al., 1997;
Walcott and Summerﬁeld, 2009; Sømme et al., 2010), irrespective of tectonic style and
catchment size (Figure 4.2). Hovius (1996) found the average ratio of W/S to be between
1.91 and 2.23 for drainage basins with rivers reaching 90% of the distance to the main
divide, while Talling et al. (1997) found a wider range of values with a higher mean of about
2.5 by using rivers that extended at least 70% of the distance to the main drainage divide.
The mean spacing ratio for range-scale catchments in southeast Africa is 1.94 (Walcott
and Summerﬁeld, 2009). A similar spacing ratio has been found in other drainage basin
types that are internal, commonly structurally pinned by active fault strands, or inﬁlling
‘interstitial’ space between the main range-scale drainages (Walcott and Summerﬁeld,
2009; Sømme et al., 2010). Sømme et al. (2010) tested the potential impact of geographic
location, climate and other factors by plotting the spacing ratio of 594 drainage basins in
6 modern rift zones, obtaining a mean value of 2.48 (Figure 4.2). There is no signiﬁcant
difference in the spacing ratio between the different rift provinces (Figure 4.3). Likewise, a
breakdown of the rift basin catchments into range-scale, internal/structural and interstitial,
as recommended by Walcott and Summerﬁeld (2009), revealed no signiﬁcant variation in
the spacing ratio (Figure 4.4). The regression of outlet spacing S against catchment length
Lc from the compilation of Sømme et al. (2010) gives
S = 0.638L0.915
c
(4.2)
The aspect ratio of W/S therefore seems to be an intrinsic product of drainage organisa-
tion. If so, the spacing ratio may be useful in estimating catchment sizes of ancient sediment
routing systems where the locations of depositional apices are known from stratigraphic
studies, or alternatively in estimating the outlet points of depositional systems where the
range width is constrained from structural geology.
4.1.2 Bedrock Channels
The incision of rivers into bedrock controls the response of landscapes to uplift and thereby
the ﬂux of sediment into downstream basins in the sediment routing system. Incision rates
can be measured at a variety of timescales. A common method is to measure the height
of dated strath terraces or lava ﬂows above the present-day river bed. In addition, erosion
rates of a channel can be calculated using cosmogenic radionuclides, the concentration
of radionuclides reﬂecting the time a sample of bedrock from the river channel has spent
within the nuclide production zone at and close to the surface of the Earth. Erosion at much
shorter timescales can be directly measured using calibrated pins drilled into bedrock, but

this method is restricted to bedrock channels undergoing high incision rates of greater than

Hillslope processes and topographic proﬁles are set by the boundary condition of
channel erosion, and the products of hillslope erosion are transported away by these
channelised ﬂows. Channelised ﬂow takes place wherever a stream power threshold is
locally exceeded (Montgomery and Dietrich, 1988). There is a fundamental distinction,
however, between rivers incised into bedrock and alluvial rivers with beds and banks of
sediment. Bedrock rivers are those that lack a coherent bed of active alluvium (Howard,
.005
15:07:00

90
The Catchment-Fluvial Segment
1987). Consequently, bedrock rivers have a transport capacity that is larger than that
required to transport all of the available sediment. They incise by abrasion by the sediment
load, plucking of blocks from the bed, and cavitation (Hancock et al., 1998). Bedrock
rivers are the dominant channel type in mountainous topography.
The evolution of the proﬁles of bedrock channels is conventionally assessed using a
framework based on stream power, equivalent to the rate of potential energy loss as the
river ﬂows from high to low elevations. The stream power rule is a framework that relates
the elevation change in a bedrock channel to a power law of water discharge and slope. It
is commonly used in landscape evolution models.
Since the discharge of a river is highly unsteady, Howard and Kerby (1983) suggested
that channel incision rate is proportional to the ‘dominant discharge’, represented by a
drainage area AD, since water discharge must scale in some way on the product of the
contributing drainage area above the channel and the average precipitation over that area.
The rate of channel incision is then given by
∂y
∂t = kAm
DSn
(4.3)
where m and n are constants that vary in value depending on whether the stream power
or shear stress rules are being applied. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the
values of k, m and n in bedrock channels. The coefﬁcient k is particulary hard to constrain,
since it folds in a large number of variables relevant to channel incision.
The values of the exponents m and n have received a good deal of attention. In chan-
nels incising badlands topography, m and n were calculated as 0.45 and 0.70 respectively
(Howard and Kerby, 1983), whereas in valleys on a basaltic shield volcano, it was found
that m = n = 1 (Seidl, Dietrich, and Kirchner, 1994). Using a ﬁnite difference method,
Stock and Montgomery (1999) optimised values of m, n and k by matching the lowering of
ancient river proﬁles preserved as strath terraces and lava ﬂow tops with observed proﬁles.
Optimised values of k, m and n from 4 different settings are given in Table 4.1. Rivers with
a strong area dependence on incision rate are associated with stable base levels (as in the
Australian examples in Table 4.1), the stream power law taking the form
dy
dt = k[1]A0.3−0.5S1
(4.4)
Rivers with a small area dependence on incision, however, have base levels that vary
strongly enough to cause the upstream propagation of knickpoints, as in the Hawaiian
examples, where incision rate is dependent on locally steepened slopes. In this case the
rate of incision is expressed as
dy
dt = k[2]A0.1−0.2S0−2
(4.5)
In the simplest case, where knickpoint migration is not involved, we can assume that
k is a constant determined by lithology, ranging from 10−4 to 10−2 for mudstones, from
10−5 to 10−4 for volcaniclastic rocks and from 10−7 to 10−6 for granitic and metamorphic

rocks (units of m0.2 yr−1) (Stock and Montgomery, 1999). This range is supported by
the mean value of k in Nepalese rivers cutting into relatively easily erodible material
at 4.3 × 10−4 (Kirby and Whipple, 2001). The wide variability of the bedrock incision
coefﬁcient with respect to lithology suggests that the landscapes of bedrock rivers and
fringing hillslopes, and their response times to perturbations (Section 8.5), are strongly
sensitive to bedrock geology. In the progressive exhumation of an orogen, for example, as
the sedimentary cover is eroded to expose crystalline basement, there should be a slowing in
the erosion rate. Likewise, erosion rates and landscape response times should vary as thrust-
related anticlines grow and undergo exhumation, as in the case of the Zagros fold-thrust belt
of Iran and western Pakistan (Tucker and Slingerland, 1996) (Section 8.6.3). The possibility
that k may vary over 5 orders of magnitude as a result of lithological factors makes the use
of the stream power rule in analysing ancient landscapes and sediment routing systems
challenging.
Since k represents the proportion of stream power expended in incision as opposed
to generating heat and transporting loose sediment, the coefﬁcient should change along
the river proﬁle, since in steep reaches debris ﬂows are likely to play an important role

incorporate the enhanced incision due to debris ﬂow activity.
Harel, Mudd, and Attal (2016) compiled a global data set of published basin-averaged
erosion rates derived from the analysis of detrital cosmogenic 10Be from 1,457 rivers in
a wide range of topographic, climatic and tectonic settings (Section 7.6). At the global
scale they found median values of the slope exponent n of generally greater than 1
(Table 4.2), implying that the erosion rate is a non-linear function of the channel slope.
This non-linearity suggests that bedrock channel incision is a threshold-controlled process.
4.1.3 Effect of Tectonic Uplift on River Long Proﬁles
In Section 4.1.2, it was suggested that the longitudinal proﬁle of a river can be modeled
using the stream power rule. A tectonic displacement ﬁeld causing uplift of rocks has
impact on the long proﬁle of the river, including on parameters such as m, n and k. Tectonic
uplift commonly results in knickzones that propagate upstream as convex reaches. The
analysis of longitudinal stream proﬁles is useful in assessing landscape response to forcing
mechanisms such as variations in tectonic uplift rate. The stream power law can therefore be
built upon by including a term for the tectonic uplift rate of rock. In steady-state conditions
bedrock river erosion is balanced by the uplift ﬁeld U(x, t), so that
U(x, t) = kAmSn
(4.6)
U is considered initially to be spatially uniform, and m and n are constants, so equation (4.6)
becomes after rearrangement
S =
U
k
1/n
A−m/n
(4.7)
Equation (4.7) has the form of a power law (Sklar and Dietrich, 1998; Kirby and Whip-
ple, 2001). For the uniform rock uplift case, the straight line regression of log S plotted
against log A has a slope of −m/n, and an intercept of (U/k)1/n, both of which can be
derived from plots of ﬁeld data from modern rivers (Snyder et al., 2000).
A spatially variable tectonic uplift ﬁeld can be approximated by a simple uplift function
U = U0xα, where U0 is the rock uplift rate at the edge of the model, x is the horizontal coor-
dinate and α is a constant describing the downstream gradient in tectonic uplift rate. This
.005
15:07:00

4.1 Hillslopes and Bedrock Channels
93
simple uplift function yields a power law relationship between slope and area. Assuming
Hack’s Law for drainage area A versus downstream distance x, A = kaxh, and steady-state
conditions, this power law relationship has gradient and intercepts giving the coefﬁcient ks
(steepness) and the exponent (concavity) θ of the stream power law as follows (Kirby and
Whipple, 2001):
ks = (U0/k)1/nk−(α/hn)
a
(4.8)
and
θ = (m/n) −(α/hn)
(4.9)
Equations (4.8) and (4.9) indicate that where the rock uplift rate increases downstream
(α > 0), streams should have low concavity or even convexity (θ < 0), whereas where
the rock uplift rate decreases downstream (α < 0), streams should have high concavity
(α > 0). A study of the concavity of streams crossing the Siwalik Hills (Kirby and Whipple,
2001) showed strong variations in θ dependent on the gradients in tectonic uplift rate
associated with differential movement across the Main Frontal Thrust (Lavé and Avouac,
2001). Channels crossing the tectonically uplifting anticline from north to south experience
increasing tectonic uplift rate and have convex-up longitudinal proﬁles (θ < 0). Tectonic
uplift rates and their lateral variability can therefore potentially be inverted from stream
proﬁles if parameter values can be well calibrated.
Deep incision by rivers causes a removal of mass from the area undergoing erosion,
which drives an isostatic compensation (Molnar and England, 1990). Consequently, the
high mountain peaks fringing deeply incised valleys may experience a surface uplift. This
possibility can be stated in terms of a bedrock river incision rule. Assuming the isostatic
uplift to be due to a local (Airy) compensation rather than to a regional ﬂexure, the rate of
uplift of the mountain peaks is

where ρc and ρm are the crustal and mantle densities respectively, yp is the elevation of
the mountain peak, x is the horizontal coordinate, and S is the slope. Using c1 = 0.5 m−1
Myr−1, proﬁles along the Arun and Karnali rivers in the Nepalese Himalaya show the
elevation of mountain peaks some distance downstream from the drainage divides in the
Tibetan plateau (Montgomery, 1984) (Figure 4.5). The greatest relief is on the edge of
the Himalayan plateau, where the Karnali River has incised 4,500 m below the surrounding
peaks. As much as 20 to 30% of the present elevation of the Himalayan peaks can be
explained by isostatic compensation.
4.1.4 Hillslopes
Hillslopes convey both water and sediment into river channels, which are situated at the
foot of the slope. As Robert and Suzanne Anderson put it (Anderson and Anderson, 2010)

Hillslopes . . . do not exist in isolation, but are linked to their bounding channels. To put it mathemat-
ically, channels serve as the bottom boundary conditions for the hillslopes.
Channels and hillslopes therefore act in a coupled process system. The topography gener-
ated by tectonics is degraded through the action of this coupled system. Rivers typically
become entrenched in position, cutting down like cheese wires through the regionally

uplifting bedrock (Burbank et al., 1996). The intervening hillslope system provides ero-
sional material by soil creep, overland ﬂow, gullying, debris ﬂows, landslides and rockfalls.
If the rate of hillslope erosion is slower than the rate of valley lowering, hillslopes steepen
and eventually become susceptible to landsliding involving bedrock. The amplitude of
hillslopes is therefore set by the effect of rock strength on landsliding. The ﬂuvial system
transports away material derived from hillslope erosion through its channel networks. Evac-
uation may be signiﬁcantly delayed where high-magnitude trigger events such as earth-
quakes cause an instantaneous discharge from hillslopes, blocking valleys with landslide
and debris-ﬂow dams (Li et al., 2014).
In mountain ranges landslide activity, triggered by rainstorms and co-seismic shaking
(Densmore and Hovius, 2000), is critical to the clearing of hillslopes (Densmore et al.,
1997). A number of rapidly uplifting mountain belts (for example, the Southern Alps of
New Zealand and the Karakorum range of the western Himalayas) are believed to exhibit
a steady-state topography where the tectonic rate of uplift of rock is balanced by the
landslide-dominated erosional sediment efﬂux. In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the
ﬂux of material due to landsliding estimated over a 60-year period (several mm yr−1) is
roughly equivalent to the sediment output of the main rivers draining the region (Hovius
et al., 2007).
Hillslopes involve a downslope motion of material, whether quasi-continuously by slow
creep, or in discrete events. Over time, most hillslopes take on a smooth, convex-upward
proﬁle, suggesting that hillslopes might be modelled as a diffusive process. Sediment diffu-
sion models are based on two ﬁrst-order assumptions: (1) the sediment continuity equation
(also known as the Exner equation), which states that the spatial variation in the sediment
transport rate qs is proportional to the vertical erosion or aggradation rate of the substrate,
∂qs/∂x = −ρb∂y/∂t, where ρb is the bulk density of the mobile regolith, assuming there
to be no changes in the concentration of suspended sediment; and (2) that the ﬂux is
proportional to the local gradient, qs = −k∂y/∂x, where k is a transport coefﬁcient, which
is a basic notion underpinning all diffusional problems. The change of elevation over a time
step t is the familiar diffusion equation
∂y
∂t = κ ∂2y
∂x2
(4.11)
where κ
= k/ρb is the diffusion coefﬁcient linking the change in elevation to the
topographic curvature.
The derivation of solutions for the sediment discharge, slope and maximum relief of
hillslopes undergoing diffusion is given in a number of sources, including appendix 42,
pages 532–533, in Allen and Allen (2013); pages 30–34 in Pelletier (2008); and pages
309–313 in Anderson and Anderson (2010). The shape of diffusional hillslopes is parabolic,
with a maximum slope at the river channel and a minimum slope at the hillslope crest:

where V is the incision rate of the channels, equivalent to the uplift rate of rock in a steady-
state proﬁle, κ is the diffusivity, L is the length of the hillslope from ridge crest to valley
bottom and x is the horizontal coordinate (Figure 4.6). The characteristic timescale for
diffusional hillslopes is of the familiar form τ = L2/κ. If two channels located 100 m
apart (L = 50 m) incise at a rate of 0.5 mm yr−1, typical of tectonic uplift rates, and
a diffusion coefﬁcient applicable to the slow processes of rainsplash and soil creep is
50 × 10−3 m2 yr−1, the maximum gradient of the hillslope is 0.5 (tan−1 0.5 is 27◦). The
time constant is 50 kyr.
The weathering of hillslope rock results in regolith, which mantles the bedrock surface.
Consequently, there are two interacting surfaces: a topographic surface with elevations
given by h(x, t) and a weathering front with elevations given by b(x, t). The difference
.005

between these two elevations is the regolith thickness η(x, t) (Figure 4.6). The simplest
way to express the coupling of the bedrock and topographic surfaces is given by
∂η
∂t = −ρb
ρs
∂b
∂t −κ ∂2h
∂x2
(4.13)
In other words, the change in thickness of regolith over time is the sum of the change in
elevation of the bedrock surface and the change in elevation of the surface topography (see
equation (4.11)). The change of elevation of the bedrock surface occurs at a rate dependent
on depth below the topographic surface given by
∂b
∂t = −P0e−η/η0
(4.14)
where P0 is the regolith production rate for bare bedrock and η0 is the characteristic regolith
depth, which expresses the rate at which regolith production reduces with increasing depth
below the surface. Such a depth proﬁle of regolith production has been veriﬁed from
cosmogenic nuclide analyses (Heimsath et al., 1997).
Diffusion theory can also be used to study the degradation of fault scarps (Hanks et al.,
1984), river terraces (Avouac, 1993) or independently dated wave-cut lake margin scarps,
such as those of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, Utah. The scarp proﬁle evolves over time by
an erosional smoothing of the upper portion and a depositional smoothing of the lower por-
tion. The slope of the mid-point of the scarp decays as the square root of time. Diffusivities
in the present-day arid landscapes of the American West were estimated as 5,100 × 10−3
m2 yr−1 (Burbank and Anderson, 2001). However, a large number of studies suggest
that we cannot always assume that the diffusivity κ is constant and independent of x on
hillslopes and scarps of various origins. Furthermore, the upper parts of hillslope proﬁles
may be strongly affected by the regolith production rate, so that they are weathering-limited
and therefore not strictly determined by linear diffusion (Rosenbloom and Anderson, 1994).
When mass ﬂow such as landsliding is the dominant form of erosion on hillslopes the
sediment ﬂux increases nonlinearly with the topographic gradient. Hillslopes become linear
and the drainage divide becomes knife-edge sharp instead of gently parabolic (Roering,
Kirchner, and Dietrich, 1999). In a nonlinear model, the sediment ﬂux increases rapidly as
the hillslope gradient approaches a critical value. The sediment ﬂux is given by (Howard,
1997; Roering et al., 1999):
¯qs =
κ∂y/∂x
1 −(|∂y/∂x|/Sc)2
(4.15)
where κ is the diffusivity (L2/T), Sc is the critical hillslope gradient and |∂y/∂x| is the abso-
lute value of the topographic gradient. From equation (4.15), the sediment ﬂux becomes
inﬁnite at the critical hillslope gradient Sc.
If the channel incision rate is large compared to the diffusive mass wasting of the
hillslope, a critical slope will be reached after which landsliding takes place. This is why
.005

The Catchment-Fluvial Segment
mountains with high channel incision rates, such as the Southern Alps of New Zealand
and the Finisterre Range of Papua New Guinea, have hillslopes dominated by landslid-
ing. Landslide-dominated hillslopes are straight rather than parabolic (Anderson, 1994;
Densmore et al., 1997; Densmore and Hovius, 2000). The critical slope for the onset of
landsliding depends on bedrock strength, vegetation cover and ﬂuid pressures in the regolith
and bedrock. It is likely to vary between about 30◦and 60◦. For effective diffusivities in the
range 10 to 100 ×10−3 m2 yr−1, the channel incision rates required to initiate landsliding
at critical slopes between 40◦and 60◦are 0.2−3.5 mm yr−1. This range covers the tectonic
uplift rates of recent mountain belts. The rates of rock uplift along the Alpine Fault in the
Southern Alps of New Zealand is more than 5 mm yr−1, with rates of 1 mm yr−1 along the
main drainage divide of the Southern Alps (Koons, 1989). The Central Range of Taiwan
and the Finisterre Range, Papua New Guinea, have similar tectonic rates of rock uplift.
On the western ﬂank of the Southern Alps of New Zealand (Koons, 1989), where the
lateral distance from interﬂuve to interﬂuve L = 3,000 m, the maximum topographic relief
ymax = 1,500 m, and V is approximately 5 mm yr−1, the effective erosional hillslope diffu-
sivity must be 15 m2 yr−1 (Figure 4.7). It is considerably higher than the value of 0.01 m2
yr−1 estimated for the semi-arid to arid hillslopes in the western United States (Rosenbloom
and Anderson, 1994). The effective erosional hillslope diffusivity encompasses a whole
range of geomorphological processes acting on the hillslope, and therefore may lump
together the effects of mean annual precipitation (more than 1 m yr−1) and rainfall intensity,
rock strength, vegetation and temperature-dependent weathering. The value calculated here
reﬂects the high activity of rapid mass wasting events. The mean gradient of the hillslopes
from the diffusion model is ymax/L, which for the Southern Alps examples is 0.5, or 27◦.
This corresponds closely with measured mean values.
The transverse spacing of hillslopes must always be small (high drainage density, equa-
tion (4.1)) in order to balance high rates of tectonic uplift of rock in a steady-state land-
scape. On the drier eastern ﬂank of the Southern Alps (less than 1 m yr−1 mean annual
precipitation) the tectonic uplift rates reduce from 1 mm yr−1 at the main divide to zero at
the east coast of South Island. On this ﬂank, braided river valleys are broadly spaced (low
drainage density, equation (4.1)) and less deeply entrenched into bedrock (Figure 4.7).
The ratio ymax/L can also be written as VL/2κ. This is a dimensionless ratio of a ﬂow
rate of rock across a section of the transverse drainage relative to an effective erosional
diffusivity. It has the form of a Péclet number. If the erosional Péclet number is greater than
about 0.6, it is unlikely that erosional processes can keep pace with tectonic uplift rates to
produce a steady-state landscape. The erosional Péclet number for the wet western ﬂank of
the Southern Alps, using the parameter values provided earlier, is 0.5.
Hillslopes and bedrock channels are dynamically linked, but they have different
response times (Section 8.5). The hillslope response time introduced previously is L2/κ.
The response time of the channel system must be inﬂuenced by the length of the channel
and the average velocity of the knickpoints generated when the channel adjusts to its
new base level. Such knickpoints migrate headwards, but slow down in their upstream
velocity as the stream power decreases due to a reduction in the contributing drainage area.

Anderson (1994) calculated channel system response times assuming the stream power rule
as typically 103 to greater than 104 yr. This is signiﬁcantly longer than the response time for
landslides, but is comparable to the hillslope response time. This suggests that hillslopes
characterised by the high effective diffusivities produced by landslides are always in
equilibrium with the incising channels. Less steep hillslopes dominated by slow diffusion,
however, may not be in equilibrium with channel incision and may display transient rather
than steady-state morphologies.

The Catchment-Fluvial Segment
4.2 Basin-Margin Fans
Alluvial fans are -shaped sediment bodies with distributive channel networks, commonly
developed at basin margins where an upland catchment enters an adjacent basin. Alluvial
fans therefore build up at the abrupt change in topographic slope characteristic of tecton-
ically active basin margins. Although fans may comprise debris cones in steep bedrock
channels and accumulations at tributary (wadi) junctions (Al-Farraj and Harvey, 2005),
fans at mountain fronts are focussed upon here. Sediment is deposited on the fan surface
by debris ﬂow and stream ﬂow, with localised contributions from landslides, soil creep
and aeolian fall-out. They occur in all climatic zones, from arid to humid and from hot
to cold. Some catchment-fans act as closed systems amenable to a balance of mass or
volume, whereas others involve an export or leakage of sediment to playas and axial river
systems. The progradation distance of fans away from the mountain front, because of
their simple planform geometry, is an indicator of the balance between sediment supply
from the catchment and the subsidence rate in the basin. The sediment budget manifests
itself in a relationship between catchment area and fan area as originally proposed by Bull
(1962, 1964), which is strongly inﬂuenced by the tectonic subsidence in the basin, whether
spatially uniform (Allen and Hovius, 1998) or spatially variable (Whipple and Trayler,
1996).
The fan model involves a source catchment of area Ac feeding a fan of area Af (Figure
4.8). The relation between Ac and Af is known from geomorphic studies of modern fans
(Hooke, 1968; Bull, 1977; Lecce, 1991) as having a power law form
Af = cAn
c
(4.16)
where the coefﬁcient c and the exponent n have values reported in the literature attributed
to factors such as variation in bedrock lithology, climate, rate of uplift of rock in source
areas and basin subsidence. There is considerable variation in c and n in modern fans from
different climatic zones (Figure 4.9). The median value for c from the global data used in
Figure 4.9 is 0.55 (mean of 0.83) with a standard deviation of 0.85, whereas n shows less
variation, with a median value of 0.76 (mean of 0.80) and a standard deviation of 0.40.
However, fans distributed along single fault systems fall along linear trends in plots of
log(Af ) against log(Ac) (Figure 4.10) indicating that some local arrays of fans experiencing
similar arid climatic, lithological and tectonic forcings have n ∼1.
Some material derived by hillslope erosion may be stored in valley bottoms instead of
being immediately transported onto the alluvial fan. The efﬁciency of sediment transport
from hillslopes to the fan apex (es) therefore affects the discharge to the fan. The storage
efﬁciency factor es, which varies from zero (complete storage) to 1 (no storage), depends on
factors such as the effect of climate on run-off and topography, but empirical studies suggest
the effect is relatively small (Hooke, 1968; Hooke and Rohrer, 1977; Jansson, Jacobson,
and Hooke, 1993). There is the possibility, especially in humid climates, that some sediment
escapes the fan and is delivered to axial river systems, expressed by a second efﬁciency
factor ef , which varies from zero (complete bypass) to 1 (entire sediment load deposited

From Dade and Verdeyen (2007)(ﬁg.2a) with permission of the Geological Society.
Taking the catchment-fan as an integrated system, the ratio of catchment to fan area
(Figure 4.11) can be expressed in terms of tectonic, climatic and topographic parameters.
As a reminder, the local erosion rate of a bedrock channel sets the boundary condition
for the hillslope processes that control catchmentwide denudation and can be expressed in
terms of stream power per unit width ρgq(x)S(x), where S(x) is the local channel gradient
at x. If the catchment has a uniform cross-valley geometry, the width of the bedrock channel
at any distance from the headwaters b(x) is proportional to the average width Bc(x) of the
catchment upstream of x (Dade and Verdeyen, 2007) so that
β = b(x)
Bc(x)
(4.18)
where β is the dimensionless proportionality constant. β describes the downstream varia-
tion of channel width in relation to catchment width. Assuming the catchment has a length
Lc and a uniform precipitation rate P, the discharge per unit width becomes q(x) ≡β−1Px,
and the average erosion rate of the catchment ˆE is
ˆE = k1(1 −λr)β−1P ¯H
(4.19)
where λr is the porosity of rock in the catchment and ¯H is the average relief of the catchment
evaluated along the main channel. A readily obtained index of catchment relief is the overall
elevation difference between the headwaters and the outlet H at x = Lc. Introducing this
substitution of H for ¯H and assuming that the average erosion rate ˆE equates to the uplift
rate of rocks V in a steady state, equation (4.19) can be modiﬁed to
H = k2

k3 = ef β−1 (1 −λr)
(1 −λs)k1(H/ ¯H)
(4.23)
Equation (4.22) is a power law between the geometric area ratio and V/PH with a slope
of −1 (Figure 4.12). It suggests that the observed variation of Af /Ac from catchment-fan
systems in different tectonic and climatic settings can be attributed to variation in V/PH,
which encapsulates the effects of tectonics (through uplift rate of rocks), climate (through
precipitation) and topography (in the form of catchment relief). As an example, k1 can be
calculated from equation (4.19), with erosion rate ˆE = 1 mm yr−1, β = 0.1, precipitation
P = 0.5 m yr−1, average relief ¯H = 1 km and porosity of rocks in the catchment λr = 0.05,
giving a value of k1 = 0.2×10−6 m−1. Second, k3 can be calculated using equation (4.23),
with fan efﬁciency factor ef = 1, porosity of fan sediment λs = 0.2 and the overall relief
of the catchment H = 2 km, giving k3 = 1.25 × 10−6 m−1. Substituting this value into
equation (4.22), where the uplift rate is the same as the erosion rate in steady state, the ratio
of fan area to catchment area ψ becomes 1.25. The value of V/PH for the parameter values
given previously is 10−3 km−1.
The ratio Af /Ac is low where the tectonic velocity is high compared to precipitation,
consistent with the data for the Blackwater fans in Death Valley shown in Figure 4.10, with
ψ = Af /Ac ∼0.1. At the other extreme, the fans of Fresno County, California, have a high
value of ψ = Af /Ac of 1−2 due to the relatively low tectonic activity in the Great Valley.
4.3 Axial versus Transverse Drainage
A common arrangement of ﬂuvial elements in a sedimentary basin is for basin-margin fans
at the mountain range front to pass downsystem into axial river systems. In some cases, a
fan may develop at the meeting of a tributary with a powerful axial river, as in the case of the
San Juan River of the Argentine Andes (Colombo, 2005). A series of cycles of fan build-
up, ponding of the axial river behind the sediment dam, and scarp erosion during renewed
axial ﬂow, produce segmented or ‘telescopic’ fans. The more general case illustrated here,
however, is of an axial ﬂow as a residue of the sediment budget of fringing alluvial fans
along the mountain front.
Following Kim et al. (2011), we let the sediment discharges from hangingwall and
footwall fans be qh and qf and the axial river discharge to be qa. The transfers from footwall
and hangingwall fans to the axial system are qfa and qha. The half graben with a basin width
Wb subsides by a simple rotation at a maximum rate Smax at x = Wb, reducing to zero at

x = 0 (Figure 4.13). The lengths of the fans can be calculated using a sediment mass
balance, assuming that the ﬂuvial system remains constant in surface area and there is no
extension across the half graben. Taking the hangingwall fan, the sediment below the fan
surface is made up of that above base level and that below base level, accommodated by
tectonic subsidence. However, if the fan slope and maximum elevation do not change over
time, the sediment deposited is equal to the increment in the part below base level, so that

Figure 4.13 Transverse and axial sediment dispersal in a half-graben (a) or wedge-top basin (b).
The position of fan toes, the width of the axial system and the axial sediment ﬂux, depend on
the two transverse supplies relative to accommodation in the basin. From Allen and Allen (2013)
(ﬁg.8.20, p.303), modiﬁed from Kim et al. (2011), published with permission of Geological Society

From equations (4.24) and (4.25) it is clear that the positions of the fan toes are deter-
mined by the sediment mass balance. Inserting reasonable values for a Basin and Range
half-graben, let Wb = 20 km, and Smax = 1 mm yr−1, the widths of the fans scale on
the sediment discharge terms. The total sediment budget is qT = WbSmax/2. The fraction
delivered from each margin is therefore given by equations (4.24) and (4.25) scaled by qT.
If the fraction of the total budget supplied from each margin remains constant, the fan
toes remain stationary, despite changes in the maximum subsidence rate. Inspection of

the net discharge qh −qha scales with Smax/2. In other words, when Smax doubles through
an increase in slip rate on a bounding fault, the length of the fan stays ﬁxed if the net
discharge increases by 50%. If sediment discharge increases through a climate change,
with no change in accommodation driven by fault-related subsidence, the fan length must
change in response. This suggests that climatically driven movement of the fan toe should
be more variable than the damped (coupled) tectonically driven changes.
The width of the axial tract should vary according to the tectonic or climatic forcing.
For the coupled tectonic model, the tract remains almost stationary, but an increase in the
net discharge forced by climate results in fan toe progradation from each side of the basin
and the eventual meeting of the oppositely derived fans.
The preceding concept can be extended to the case of an array of folds bordering wedge-
top basins. The basement surface is assumed to subside in a sinusoidal pattern and we
neglect horizontal advection of rock during tectonic shortening. Accommodation is created
by an increase in the amplitude of the sine curve, keeping wavelength constant. The new
accommodation generated up to a transverse fan length from the proximal margin is

For example, with a wavelength λ of 40 km (basin width of 20 km), a maximum
subsidence rate Smax of 0.1 mm yr−1, a net sediment discharge to the fan qf −qfa of 400 m2
yr−1, an amplitude h0 of 1 km, the proximal fan length is approximately 12 km. If using
ExcelTM, equation (4.27) needs to be solved by taking arccos(x)=cos−1(x) and using an
on-line calculator, or by making a look-up table of cos(x) in ExcelTM, but the latter is slow.
We can make further use of the idea of an axial sediment discharge. For a closed
budget, the axial discharge is that remaining after sediment extraction to build fringing
fans, that is, qT = qh + qf , and qfa + qha = qa (Figure 4.14). The axial budget is
broken down into that deposited and that exported downslope qe. The fraction of the
total discharge exported through the axial system is a key parameter in understanding
the dynamics of sediment routing systems in tectonically active regions. For qe/qT ∼0,
we anticipate perfectly ﬁlled basins with little far-ﬁeld transport. For qe/qT >> 0, we
anticipate major longitudinal downslope export of sediment guided by the tectonic grain.
When there is marked asymmetry in the sediment supply combined with a high total
discharge, we anticipate extensive systems that bury underlying tectonic structures and
follow the regional transverse palaeoslope. These various outcomes have been identiﬁed in
the Tertiary alluvial fans of the fold-thrust belt and foreland basin of the central Pyrenees
in northern Spain (Allen et al., 2013) (Figure 4.15).

In both cases, the backshedding of sediment into the basin is set to zero. (a) A steep catchment feeds
a basin-margin fan at a rate qs,0, which ﬂuxes sediment to an axial system at a rate qfa. The sediment
supply is less than or approximately equal to the accommodation generation. The cumulative volume
of accommodation is denoted ‘1’, which increases over time by slip on the border fault at the rate
Smax. The volume above base level, denoted ‘2’, can be assumed to not vary over time. (b) A larger
catchment feeds a higher sediment supply into the basin, causing the progradation and coalescence
of large transverse fans and potentially the burial of the distal basin margin. A large portion of the
sediment supply is discharged through the fan to downstream transverse systems, qft, and exported to
distal foredeep depocentres, qe. The volume denoted ‘3’ may accumulate over time as base level rises
and the distal margin of the wedge-top basin is buried in sediment. From Allen et al. (2013) (ﬁg.7),

4.4 Alluvial Rivers
4.4.1 Fluvial Geomorphic Elements in Sedimentary Basins
It has previously been suggested that a survey of many (724) sedimentary basins in a
wide range of climatic and tectonic settings (Weissmann et al., 2010), and the results of
physical experiments (Sheets et al., 2002), show that terrestrial sedimentation is dominated
by distributive ﬂuvial systems (Figure 4.1). The dominance of distributive systems in net
aggradational settings contrasts with the dominantly contributive patterns observed in mod-
ern degradational settings. The occurrence of distributive rather than contributive patterns
in the rock record illustrates the role of accommodation generation, or ‘preservation space’
(Blum and Törnquist, 2000), in controlling ﬂuvial form. Distributive ﬂuvial systems take
the form commonly attributed to fans, occurring where a river becomes unconﬁned on
entering a sedimentary basin from an upland catchment or incised valley, spreading in
a radial pattern from the depositional apex. Within this general ﬂuvial form, individual
channels may be straight, braided or meandering. In large-scale distributive ﬂuvial sys-
tems there is a downstream decrease in channel size caused by bifurcation, inﬁltration

and evapotranspiration, and an increase in the ratio of ﬂoodplain area to channel area.
Switching of channel position within the ﬂoodplain is commonly by nodal avulsion near
the apex.
Sedimentary basins contain a range of ﬂuvial elements (Table 4.3) (Figure 4.16). The
largest are megafans, typical of the Himalayan and Andean foreland basins, with sur-
face areas up to ca. 700,000 km2. Megafans have large catchment areas stretching far
into the mountain sediment source area. The apices of megafans are separated by inter-
megafan rivers, which drain the foothills region, and distally pass into an axial, trunk system
(DeCelles and Cavazza, 1999). Smaller fans typically join axial systems in extensional
basins (Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000). Coalesced alluvial fans along a range front produce
bajadas. The areas occupied by distributive systems strongly exceed the areas covered by
tributive ﬂuvial systems, such as axial tributary rivers held in an axial position or focussed
in interfan positions.
The large megafans of the Himalayan and Andean foreland basins have upstream catch-
ments stretching far into the mountain belt, but the ratio of DFS surface area to catchment
area (Af /Ac = ψ) is highly variable (Figure 4.17). Taking all data combined the value
of ψ is approximately unity, which is consistent with the global compilation of Dade and
Verdeyen (2007).

4.4.2 Long-Range Sediment Transport and Deposition
Alluvial rivers (those with beds and banks of sediment) cause long-range sediment transport
from the erosional engine to inland depocentres or the ocean. The mechanics of sediment
transport by rivers is complex. In this section, the broad aspects of far-ﬁeld sediment trans-
port are tackled broadly in terms of long-term behaviour rather than in terms of individual

ﬂood events. More comprehensive treatments of long-range sediment transport by rivers are
found in Parker (1978a), Parker (1978b), Paola et al. (1992) and Dade and Friend (1998).
Bridge (2003) and Bridge and Demicco (2008) provide much useful information on rivers
and ﬂuvial deposits.
A useful starting point for considering sediment transport and deposition in alluvial
rivers is to treat the system as overall diffusive in character. That is, the sediment ﬂux scales
on the topographic gradient, and the elevation change of the river bed over time scales on
the topographic curvature.
Various forms of diffusion equation have been applied to long-range ﬂuvial transport.
Here we concentrate on an assessment of long-range ﬂuvial transport of a mixture of gravel
and sand. The quantitative development of this group of models can be found in Paola
et al. (1992) and Marr et al. (2000). It is well known that in modern mixed gravel-sand
ﬂuvial systems there is a relatively steep gravelly proximal zone with an abrupt change to a
lower gradient sandy zone (Sambrook Smith and Ferguson, 1996). To be able to predict the
movement of the gravel front, or gravel-sand transition, would be of considerable beneﬁt
in basin analysis (Section 8.1).
Most models of sediment transport in rivers make the same set of assumptions (Paola,
2000):
(1) It is assumed that the long-term ﬂow of water in a river approximates that of a steady
uniform ﬂow down an inclined plane. For a ﬂow of depth h and density ρf on a slope ∂y/∂x,
the downslope component of the ﬂuid weight on a unit area of the river bed is ρf gh∂y/∂x.
This downslope acting force must be opposed by an equal and opposite drag force exerted
on the ﬂuid by the unit area of bed. This is the shear stress τ0. Consequently, the force
balance gives
.005
15:07:00

112
The Catchment-Fluvial Segment
τ0 = −ρf gh∂y
∂x
(4.28)
Rivers are anything but steady and uniform. However, equation (4.28) can be used as
an approximation for long-term river behaviour. It works best for shallow high-gradient
streams and worst for deep, low-gradient streams. If the ﬂow depth is large compared to
the channel width, h should be replaced by the hydraulic radius R in equation (4.28), where
the hydraulic radius is the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter, R = wh/
(w + 2h), and w is the channel width.
(2) A ﬂuid moving over its bed and banks experiences frictional losses of energy known
as ﬂow resistance. Where the bed of the river is rough, as is always the case in natural
rivers, the energy losses should in some way be related to the length scale of the roughness
of the bed. This roughness can be expressed in a number of ways. A common method is to
use the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f
f = 8τ0
ρf u2
(4.29)
where u is the ﬂow velocity. The friction factor (or similar forms such as the Chézy coefﬁ-
cient C and Manning’s n) varies strongly according to the grain size of the sediment on the
river bed and is especially affected by the presence of bedforms such as ripples and dunes
and of macroforms such as bars, chutes and pools.
(3) Third, the discharge of water through the system is conserved. Consider a slice of
width B of an alluvial basin of length L, which has active channels on its surface with
cumulative width b, of ﬂow depth h and containing ﬂows of velocity u (Figure 4.18). Let
β be the fraction of the section width B occupied by channels, so β = b/B. The discharge
of water Qw in the channels occupying the width of ﬂoodplain B is bhu, or averaged across
the ﬂoodplain is βhu. Consequently,
β = Qw
hu
(4.30)
(4) Finally, use is made of the sediment continuity equation, modiﬁed by the use of a
Shields-type dimensionless shear stress τ ∗,
τ ∗=
τ0

ρs −ρf

gD
(4.31)
where D is the median grain size and ρs and ρf are the sediment and ﬂuid densities
respectively. There appear to be strong limits on the value of the dimensionless shear
stress, so that it can be treated as a constant, at about 1.4 times the critical shear stress
at the threshold of particle motion in coarse-grained braided rivers, and between 1 and 2 in
alluvial sand-bed rivers (Paola and Seal, 1995; Dade and Friend, 1998; Parker et al., 1998).
It is probably a constant because if it is too high, the stream erodes its banks and widens its
bed, thereby reducing the shear stress per unit area of stream bed (Parker, 1978a,b). There
is a sharp jump in τ ∗at the gravel front in many rivers.

diffusivity for present-day rivers, but has limited applicability in geological studies. An
alternative formulation (Smith and Bretherton, 1972; Simpson and Schlunegger, 2003),
where sediment-hydrodynamic constraints are lacking is:
κ = κl + cf (αx)m
(4.34)
where κl is the linear hillslope diffusivity, α is the mean annual precipitation, x is the
horizontal coordinate along the direction of concentrative ﬂow, which causes the water
discharge qw to increase downstream, m is an exponent, which is normally assumed to
equal 2, and cf is a ﬂuvial transport coefﬁcient, assumed to be equal to 10−6.
Equations (4.33) and (4.34) are functionally similar, since qw approximates αx, the drag
coefﬁcient, submerged speciﬁc weight of the sediment and the dimensionless shear stress
can be assumed to be constant, and κl is negligible compared to the second term on the
right hand side of equation (4.34). Typical values for κ used by Marr et al. (2000) are 0.01
km2 yr−1 in the gravel regime and 0.1 km2 yr−1 in the sand regime.
A discussion of the response times of alluvial systems is found in Section 8.5.1.
4.4.3 River Planform Patterns and Long Proﬁles of Alluvial Rivers
Viewed from the air, rivers display a variety of patterns, but the main characteristics can
be simply summarised as comprising two forms: a single, sinuous channel and interwoven
multiple channels, known conventionally as meandering and braided respectively. Mean-
dering and braided patterns are associated with combinations of discharge characteristics,
grain size of the bed and banks and channel slope. The two planform patterns can be
inferred from the architecture of ﬂuvial stratigraphy, very occasionally from exhumed
planform surfaces in outcrops, and increasingly from very high resolution seismic reﬂection
data sets.
Braided patterns are favoured by river banks that lack cohesion, sediment transport
mostly as bedload, and highly ﬂuctuating ﬂow discharge, which results in multiple threads
of shallow channels. Braided rivers are typical of glacial outwash and basin-margin fans.
Braided systems can be generated in numerical models and in laboratory experiments
(Murray and Paola, 1994). Meandering patterns depend on the existence of cohesive bank
material. The meanders are self-similar, with wavelengths of the loops roughly 11 times
the river width (Leopold and Wolman, 1960). Meandering rivers have also been generated
in numerical models (Sun, Meakin, and Jossang, 1996, 2001; Lancaster and Bras, 2002),
but are more difﬁcult to reproduce in experiments. The alluvial architecture resulting from
the preservation of the deposits of braided and meandering rivers is found in innumerable
sedimentological studies. In essence, braided rivers produce sheets of sand and gravel
with little preservation of ﬁne sediment. Meandering systems produce plugs where lateral
migration was limited, and sheets of sand encased in ﬂoodplain ﬁne sediments where the
meander migrated laterally. Meander migration lengthens the river over time, but even-
tually the meander is cut off at the neck of the loop, leaving behing an ox-bow lake.
.005
15:07:00

4.4 Alluvial Rivers
115
Ox-bow lakes are storage sites of sediment (Section 4.5), with lengths L that are log-
normally distributed given by
L = 3.0e0.82S
(4.35)
where S is the sinuosity (Constantine and Dunne, 2008).
Alluvial rivers are concave up in longitudinal proﬁle, the elevation of the mouth of
the river acting as a base level. Base level might be the ocean, an inland lake, a playa
or alluvial plain. It acts as a bottom boundary condition and may move dynamically as
a result of tectonic processes, climate change or the periodic tidal variation of the ocean.
The stream proﬁle is a logarithmic function of the distance from the drainage divide. This
can be demonstrated by introducing a stream gradient index (Hack, 1973), which describes
how the local slope ∂y/∂x depends on the downstream distance x. The elevation of the river
is then
y = −
∂y
∂xx

ln(x/L)
(4.36)
where the term in square brackets is the stream gradient index and L is the length of
the system at which the stream elevation is at base level. The alluvial river therefore
has a concave up proﬁle, with the river discharge increasing downstream as the local
slope reduces. The downstream reduction in slope is accompanied by a reduction in grain
size in the river bed. This grain-size reduction is achieved by a combination of attrition
or comminution during transport, weathering during periods when clasts are at rest, and
selective deposition (Section 9.4).
River long proﬁles can also be matched closely with curves representing the solution
for thermal diffusion following instantaneous heating (Allen and Allen, 2013) (appendix
48, p.541). This approach, originally proposed by Culling (1960), is widely applied to the
cooling of the ocean lithosphere. Like the logarithmic proﬁle discussed previously, diffusive
proﬁles are also concave-up.
We assume a steady sediment discharge to solve for the elevation of the depositional
surface h (Turcotte and Schubert, 2002) (p.193), which has the form of a complementary
error function (erfc):

where x is the horizontal coordinate, qs,0 is the unit width sediment discharge at the sedi-

diffusion distance and is an index, in this application, of the rate of downstream decay of
elevation. The sediment discharge at the source is a function of the slope at x = 0,

(4.40)
For example, let the proximal slope be −0.075 and the elevation at the depositional
apex be h0 = 400 m. The unit width sediment discharge at x = 0 is then 1.68 m2 yr−1 for
t = 106 yr, from which κ must be 7.1 m2 yr−1.
The heat equation can be used to model delta clinoforms and alluvial fans where there
is a single sediment source, but also entire ﬂuvial systems. The long proﬁle of the alluvial
section of the Magdalena River, for example, can be closely matched by a thermal diffusion
model, with a slope at x = 0 of 0.333 × 10−3 and an elevation h0 of 100 m. It should be
emphasised, however, that real river systems, such as the Magdalena, have many tributaries
(Restrepo et al., 2006a,b; Kettner, Restrepo, and Syvitski, 2010) and the value of qs,0 cannot
be expected to compare closely with the sediment discharge through an upstream gauging
station.
4.5 Floodplains as Sediment Stores
Floodplains, as the name suggests, are inundated during river ﬂood events when chan-
nel banks are overtopped. Floodwaters transport sediment into the ﬂoodplain, but only
the ﬁnest grain sizes succeed in escaping the channel and reaching the ﬂoodplain where
they settle out. Flood events are stochastic and river discharges vary strongly in magni-
tude and frequency. As a result, there is much interest in the response of the landscape
to small, frequent ﬂoods relative to large, rare ﬂoods. The magnitude-frequency char-
acteristics of ﬂoods affect river incision, bedload sediment transport and the inundation
of ﬂoodplains.
The distribution of the largest ﬂood discharges can be ﬁtted by a power law (Turcotte
and Greene, 1993; Lague, Hovius, and Davy, 2005; Malamud and Turcotte, 2006):
N(Q) ∝Q−α
(4.41)
where N(Q) is the number of ﬂoods with discharge greater than Q and α is an empirical
constant with a value between 1 and 6 (Figures 4.19, 4.20). In arid climates, there are
relatively more high magnitude ﬂoods compared to low magnitude ﬂoods, so the slope of
the power law α is smaller than in rivers in temperate climates. Rivers might therefore do
more geomorphic work in arid climates than in more humid or temperate climates because
of the effect of discharge variability, parameterised by α. The relationship between the
power law exponent α and the annual precipitation represented by ¯P shows the relation

where n ∼1.6. Despite the scatter, the trend in Figure 4.20 supports the view that large
ﬂoods occur more frequently relative to small ﬂoods in arid climates than in more humid or
temperate climates. The exponent α therefore varies from catchment to catchment depend-
ing on precipitation and precipitation variability. The impact of precipitation variability on
erosion and sediment yield is further developed in Section 9.2.
For the ﬂoodplain to be inundated, the river must exceed its bankfull depth, which can
be expressed as Qw > Qb, the condition that the river discharge exceeds the bankfull
discharge. Since the size of particulate sediment in the channel depends on depth within
the ﬂow, only the ﬁner grains are able to be advected into the ﬂoodplain. As the shallow
ﬂoodwaters decelerate by the effects of the frictional resistance of the substrate, sediment
is dropped from suspension onto the ﬂoodplain surface. The sediment concentration proﬁle
of an open channel ﬂow is given by

where C is the suspended sediment concentration, Ca is the concentration at a reference
level close to the bed a, which might be the concentration in the moving bedload layer
predicted by a bedload sediment transport equation, w is the settling velocity, u∗is the
shear velocity, h is the total ﬂow depth and k is von Karman’s constant, generally taken
as 0.4. The dimensionless group w/ku∗is termed the Rouse Number. A Rouse Number
of 2.5 corresponds to the case w = u∗, a rough criterion for suspension. If the settling
velocity exceeds the shear velocity, the Rouse Number should exceed 2.5 and bedload
transport rather than suspension should take place. Equation (4.43) can be used to plot the
concentration proﬁle for a given grain size with a single value of settling velocity w. An
illustration of the use of equation (4.43) is given below for the Mississippi River at St Louis,
Missouri. The river at St Louis is 8.5 m deep and the velocity proﬁle measured on 24 April
1956 is as given in Table 4.4 (Colby, 1963). A reference depth of a = 0.5 m is taken. From
the velocity proﬁle, the shear velocity u∗can be calculated from
u∗= k(u1 −u2)/2.3(log y1 −log y2)
(4.44)
which gives u∗= 0.245 m s−1. We take ﬁve grain-size classes, with average settling
velocities as given in Table 4.5. Clearly, the vertical proﬁle of sediment concentration
depends on grain size, with ﬁne sizes distributed uniformly in the ﬂow, and coarse grain
sizes concentrated near the bed (Figure 4.21), Consequently, during ﬂood events when the
river overtops its banks, the ﬁne sediment is decanted into the ﬂoodplain while the coarse
sediment is retained in the channel. A similar process in subaqueous turbiditic settings is
known as ‘ﬂow stripping’.
The deposition rate of a ﬂoodplain may vary spatially due to proximity to the chan-
nel, presence of vegetation and the topographic effects of abandoned channel belts. On
overtopping the channel bank, the coarsest grains are deposited in levees, while the ﬁnest
grains accumulate in ﬂood basins. The deposition rate varies as well as the grain size

where a is the mean channel-belt deposition rate, xm is the maximum ﬂoodplain distance
from the edge of the channel-belt and b is an exponent describing the lateral decrease
of ﬂoodplain deposition rate (Bridge and Mackey, 1993). In the case of a single ﬂood of
the Mississippi b was between 5 and 10 for both power and exponential functions (Kesel
et al., 1974) and a similar value of 5 was found for the Rhine-Meuse delta (Middlekoop
and Asselman, 1998). However, calculations based on longer term rates of ﬂoodplain
accumulation give a value of b of 0.5−1.8 for the power function and 0.35−1.4 for the
exponential function (Pizzuto, 1987), showing that b values decrease with increasing
timescale of observation.
Floodplain deposition is an important part of the overall sediment budget of alluvial
rivers (Figure 4.23). Using the Amazon River as an example of the exchange of sediment

at times of enhanced precipitation in the Andean catchments related to La Niña events. The
best-ﬁtting value of b in equation (4.45) is 4 (Figure 4.24), consistent with the values found
in the ﬂoodplains of other major rivers.
The sediment budget of the Amazon channel-ﬂoodplain system can be assessed for
the 2,010 km-long stretch between São Paulo de Olivença and Óbidos (Dunne et al.,
1998) (Table 4.6). In broad terms, 616 ± 44 Mt yr−1 of sediment enters the channel at
the upper end of the system at São Paulo de Olivença, which is added to by contributions
from lowland tributaries (117 ± 8 Mt yr−1) and from the sediment-laden River Madeira
(715 ± 94 Mt yr−1), making a total input of 1,448 ± 146 Mt yr−1. The annual sediment
discharge through the most downstream gauging station at Óbidos averages 1,239 ± 130
Mt yr−1, so 209 Mt of sediment must accumulate within the channel-ﬂoodplain system
each year, presenting 14% of the inﬂux. Most of the stored sediment is silt and clay, the
remainder being sand. A further 300−400 Mt yr−1 of sediment is deposited on the delta
plain downstream of Óbidos.
Analysis of the exchanges within the channel-ﬂoodplain system indicates that the
combination of deposition on bars and in the ﬂoodplain exceed erosion of channel banks
by ∼500 Mt yr−1, in contrast to the estimate of ∼200 Mt yr−1 for the entire 2,010 km-
long stretch, but the general magnitude and sign are in agreement. Exchanges within the
channel-ﬂoodplain system exceed the values for channel transport. If the average sediment
discharge past the Óbidos gauging station (1,240 Mt yr−1) is expressed as a value of 1,
the input at São Paulo de Olivença is 0.5, the contribution of the Madeira River is 0.6,
that of other tributiaries is 0.1, bank erosion is 1.3, while deposition in channel bars (0.3),
overbank areas (1.0) and ﬂoodplain channels (0.4) together amount to 1.7. These ﬁgures

imply that most or all of the sediment entering the ocean downstream of Óbidos has spent
time stored in ﬂoodplain locations, where it is subject to chemical weathering.
It is clear that an important part of the sediment budget of many drainage basins is the
sequestration of sediment in river ﬂoodplains. Alluvial sequestration not only reduces the
potential downstream discharge of sediment into the coastal ocean, but also serves to buffer
the transmission of signals through the sediment routing system (Romans et al., 2015).
The potential for sequestration can be appreciated by applying the sediment load model
BQART (Section 7.3) to an idealised catchment with run-off (m yr−1) decreasing towards
the coast, but discharge (km3 yr−1) increasing towards the coast (Syvitski and Kettner,
2008) (Table 4.7). The volume of sediment stored in the alluvial system can be expressed
as a conveyance loss (%), which increases with downstream distance, reaching 38.2% at
the most downstream station in the example given in Table 4.7.
Linked catchment-ﬂuvial segments vary in the proportion of the drainage basin area
occupied by net depositional alluvial systems compared to net erosional areas (referred to
in Section 2.3.2 as the alluvial fraction, denoted by Fa). On the basis of an analysis of 28
submodern source-to-sink systems, Sømme et al. (2009) found that the proportion of the
segment with topographic gradients of less than 0.01 increased with drainage basin area A
with a power law regression of
Fa = 43.4A0.258
(4.48)
where Fa is the alluvial fraction (approximated as having an slope of less than 0.01) and
A is in units of 106× km2 (Figure 4.25). Consequently, it can be argued that large drainage
basins act as important storage zones for sediment. These large drainage basins are typical

plot of the average slope ˆS of 1340 drainage basins versus drainage basin area (ﬁg.2.16,
p.32 in Milliman and Farnsworth (2011)). The power law regression gives
ˆS = 0.39A−0.468
(4.49)
The variation about this regression is partly accounted for by the elevation class of the
drainage basin (Figure 4.26). High mountain basins (maximum elevation greater than 3, 000
m) plot with high average gradients for a given drainage basin area, mountain basins
(maximum elevation 1,000–3,000 m) plot in an intermediate position, and upland and
lowland basins (maximum elevation less than 1, 000 m) plot with low average gradients
for a given drainage basin area. The 28 source-to-sink systems analysed by Sømme et al.
(2009) have a power law regression of ˆS = 0.45A−0.441, where A is in km2 and slope is in
m m−1, which has a similar exponent (slope) to that in equation (4.49) (0.441 compared
to 0.468). There is a similarly close correspondence for the coefﬁcient (0.45 compared to

0.39), suggesting that the ‘average’ source-to-sink system has slope attributes similar to
those of drainage basins in the mountain elevation class. Like the alluvial fraction, mean
channel gradient is a useful indicator of sediment storage potential.
The storage potential of alluvial ﬂoodplains can also be demonstrated from the sediment
discharges calculated at gauging stations and from isotopic geochemistry of sediment sam-
pled in river ﬂoodplains. Galy and France-Lanord (2001) and Goodbred and Kuehl (1998),
for example, estimated that about half of the sediment liberated by erosion in the Himalayan
mountain chain was deposited in the Ganges–Brahmaputra ﬂoodplains before entering the
ocean. Similarly, about half of the sediment released by the Andes is deposited in the
ﬂoodplains of the Amazon (Aalto et al., 2006). It is estimated that 14% of the total annual
sediment load of the Magdalena River is trapped in the Mompox Depression, which reduces
the export to the ocean to 144 Mt yr−1 (Restrepo and Kjerfve, 2000). Before construction of
the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, there was a downstream reduction of sediment
discharge of 100 Mt yr−1 between the Yichang and Datong gauging stations. This reduction
is attributed to deposition in ﬂoodplains, channels and lakes (Xu et al., 2007).
Cosmogenic nuclides accumulate in erosional source areas and their concentrations can
be used to estimate denudation rates (Section 7.6). However, changes to nuclide concen-
trations may also take place when the quartz grains bearing the cosmogenic dose are
transported through and stored within alluvial systems. The short timescale of transport
events prevents signiﬁcant change to cosmogenic nuclide concentrations, whereas storage
near the surface of the ﬂoodplain and channel banks and bars allows further accumulation
of nuclides, and burial at greater depths shields the quartz grains, allowing concentrations
to decrease over time by radioactive decay. Burial at depths below the production zone (of
order a metre) is likely in old, static ﬂoodplains, where storage times may be in excess of a
million years. Shallow and short-lived burial is typical of dynamic ﬂoodplains characterised
by rapid channel migration.
The total nuclide concentration of ﬂoodplain sediment Ctotal is made up of a concen-
tration inherited from the source and supplied through an upstream cross-section of the
channel-ﬂoodplain system Cup plus a concentration Cbank generated during ﬂoodplain stor-
age of duration t, which is calculated following Schaller et al. (2004)
Ctotal = Cupe(−λt) + Cbank
(4.50)
where λ is the decay constant (yr−1) for the nuclide being measured (26Al, 10Be, 14C). In
each following compartment of the channel-ﬂoodplain system, Cup is mixed with sediment
and nuclide ﬂuxes derived by bank erosion as the river shifts in its position across the
ﬂoodplain. The nuclide ﬂux derived from bank erosion Cbank is mainly a function of the
surface production rate P0, the storage depth in the river bank and the nuclide production
proﬁle with depth. The resulting mixture therefore has a concentration

Sediment residence time is channel belt width divided by channel migration rate. Cumulative duration
is age of alluvial sediment from radiometric dating and sediment budget studies.
where the total sediment ﬂux Qtotal is the sum of the sediment discharged into the channel-
ﬂoodplain system, such as that measured at a gauging station Qup, and the ﬂux released by
bank erosion Qbe, and Cmix(y) is the concentration tapped by bank erosion integrated over
the depth y. This procedure is repeated for every compartment of the channel-ﬂoodplain
system (Wittmann and von Blanckenburg, 2009).
The age of sediment in river ﬂoodplains can be measured using U-series dating (Dos-
seto et al., 2006) or by the calculation of sediment budgets (Hoffmann et al., 2007). On
this basis, residence times of sediment are typically 103−104 years (Table 4.8). Active,
dynamic ﬂoodplains limit the residence time of sediment, so 10Be and 26Al do not decay
and concentrations may show a slight increase relative to the inherited dose from the source
region as a result of shallow burial and surface exposure. This means that transport of
sediment through the channel-ﬂoodplain system does not change the 10Be concentration of
river-borne sediment and that the signal from the source region is preserved. In sediment-
laden rivers in dynamic settings, the upstream ﬂux overwhelms the signal generated by
bank erosion, so that even in systems with long residence times, the upstream signal is
preserved. This is supported by measurements of 10Be along about 500 km of the ﬂoodplain
of the Beni River tributary of the Amazon (Wittmann and von Blanckenburg, 2009), which
show no signiﬁcant downstream variation. Consequently, cosmogenic nuclide concentra-
tions of long half-life isotopes such as 10Be can be used to estimate denudation rates in
sediment source regions despite having undergone a protracted history of ﬂoodplain storage
(Wittmann et al., 2009).

The Catchment-Fluvial Segment
In contrast, the results for in situ-produced 14C, which has a short half-life, show a
signiﬁcant decrease in concentrations during residence in the channel-ﬂoodplain system.
This isotope might be used in future to evaluate ﬂoodplain residence times.
4.6 Palaeohydrology of Rivers
The mass balance of a sediment routing system can be estimated by approximating the
total sediment mass passing through a chosen cross-section, or fulcrum, of an axial ﬂu-
vial system (Holbrook and Wanas, 2014). The discharge of sediment across the fulcrum
can be estimated using standard palaeohydrological methods. Characteristics of the rivers
responsible for the transport and deposition of sediment can be estimated by ‘inversion’ of
properties shown by alluvial stratigraphy such as channel storey dimensions and constituent
grain sizes. Such inversion techniques are based on the fundamental principle that the
driving force for the movement of water is the downslope component of gravity acting
on the mass of water. The downslope component is balanced against the upslope-acting
frictional force at the bed. The fulcrum approach has the advantage over other methods
in not requiring the catchment area to be deﬁned and in not requiring basin volumes to
be known. However, the fulcrum method involves uncertainties in the algorithms used to
calculate water and sediment discharges and in the measurement of channel bodies that
are representative of the alluvial architecture over the time span of interest (Hajek and
Wolinsky, 2012).
Palaeohydrological analysis is fundamentally based on the equation for steady uniform
ﬂow down an inclined plane (equation 4.28) (Section 4.4.2) combined with an expression
for ﬂow resistance (equation 4.29) such as the friction factor f, Manning’s roughness
coefﬁcient n or the Chezy coefﬁcient C.
The key steps in a palaeohydrological analysis of former rivers, whether recently active
Quaternary channels (Maizels, 1986) or of channel bodies preserved in outcropping or
subsurface stratigraphy (Davidson and Hartley, 2010; Hajek and Wolinsky, 2012; Holbrook
and Wanas, 2014) rely on the measurement of channel body dimensions and grain size.
Bankfull depth of main trunk rivers can be estimated on the basis of the thickness of ﬁning-
upward cycles (storeys) preserved in outcrops, cores and well logs. Bankfull channel
width is measured in outcrops perpendicular to the palaeoﬂow direction, and where ﬂow-
perpendicular sections are not available, empirical relationships can be used, dependent
on ﬂuvial style (for example, meandering single-thread channel versus braided channels)
(Gibling, 2006; Blum et al., 2013). Flow resistance and palaeoﬂow velocity are estimated
from measurements of bedform geometry and grain size (Rubin and McCullough, 1980;
LeClair and Bridge, 2001) combined with formulations of the resistance coefﬁcient
(Van Rijn, 1984). In summary, Holbrook and Wanas (2014) give a suite of equations
for the bankfull palaeodischarge of water Qw, the discharge of bedload sediment Qb, the
discharge of suspended sediment Qss and the total sediment discharge Qt.
A compilation of data on the dimensions of ﬂuvial channel bodies shows that the
mobile channel belts of braided and low-sinuosity rivers make up the bulk of the ﬂuvial

deposits (Gibling, 2006). The width/thickness ratios of mobile channel belts (Figure 4.27)

40 km and thicknesses less than 1, 200 m, as in the case of the Castlegate Sandstone of
Utah and the Hawkesbury Sandstone of eastern Australia. Meandering river deposits form

a coherent group with moderate width and thickness of channel bodies (Figure 4.27b).
Although W/T data overlap with those of low-sinuosity and braided rivers, the ﬁeld for
meandering rivers is more restricted. Maximum thicknesses for meandering types is 38 m
and widths are greater than 15 m and typically less than 3 km. Gibling (2006) provides
further W/T plots, together with analysis, of distributary systems and channel bodies in a
range of other settings. Of these other types, valley ﬁlls on bedrock surfaces show a very
wide range of dimensions, from 12−1400 m thick and 75−5200 m wide. A ﬁne example
is the Eocene Sis palaeovalley of the Spanish Pyrenees (Vincent, 2001). In the Cretaceous
Dunvegan Formation of western Canada, an empirical relation was used for single-thread,
meandering channels (Plint and Wadsworth, 2003; Lin and Bhattacharya, 2017):
Wc = 9.8T1.82
c
(4.52)
where Wc is channel body width and Tc is mean bankfull channel depth estimated from
deposit thickness.
The use of the results from palaeohydrological analysis in making estimates of the mass
balance of stratigraphic systems is problematical because the relationship between sedi-
ment transport rates in short-term ﬂood events and longer-term discharge averages is poorly
known. Holbrook and Wanas (2014) expressed this relationship in terms of a dimensionless
year-averaged bankfull duration ˆtb (the bankfull event duration divided by the recurrence
interval of the bankfull event) and a multiplier expressing the inverse proportion of the total
sediment load transported over the year-averaged bankfull duration b:
Qmas = Qbs(ˆtb)b
(4.53)
where Qmas is the total sediment volume discharged per year on average and Qbs is the
averaged bankfull sediment discharge rate. Average values of mean annual sediment dis-
charge of individual channels can then be used to calculate the total mass or volume of
sediment discharged across the river fulcrum cross-section over the time span of interest.
Long-term averaged sediment discharges calculated in this way can be compared with
‘regional curves’ from different climates using modern drainage basin averages (Davidson
and North, 2009).
Examples of the mass balance approach using river palaeohydrology include the
Cretaceous Bahariya Formation of Egypt (Holbrook and Wanas, 2014) and the Cretaceous
Dunvegan Formation of western Canada (Lin and Bhattacharya, 2017). In addition to
providing important information on sediment ﬂuxes and budgets in palaeo-rivers, these
examples allow the size of sediment source areas to be estimated and compared with
estimates derived from other methods.

The Continental Shelf Segment
5.1 Dynamics at River Mouths
The sediment routing system is strongly impacted by deposition at the coast in subaerial and
subqueous deltas. The coast is the most dynamic of transition zones and moving boundaries
in sediment routing systems. Deltas comprise the inclined and commonly sigmoidal sedi-
ment bodies, or clinoforms, that are the building blocks for much of the stratigraphic record
of continental margins. The inclined depositional surfaces migrate by progradation driven
by sediment supply. Deposition in deltas is strongly inﬂuenced by the sediment discharge
of rivers as well as the physical oceanography and bathymetry of the marine basin into
which the river debouches (Wright, 1977; Allen, 1997). The clinoforms in the stratigraphic
record, caused by the migration of the front of deltas, are commonly recognised on seismic
reﬂection proﬁles. The shape of the clinoforms reﬂects the interplay of river discharge and
basin energy (Swenson et al., 2005).
The processes at river mouths fall broadly into the phenomena known as mixing. Mixing
is encountered in a variety of natural environmental settings, such as the meeting of two
rivers with different sediment loads at a conﬂuence, the ﬂow into a lake of a meltwater
stream, the mixing of fresh and salty water in an estuary, and the eruption into the atmo-
sphere of a column of ash from a volcano. The primary concern here is the dynamics of
rivers entering the ocean, which can be divided into two broad categories:
1. Buoyancy-driven ﬂow resulting from density differences between fresh and salty water,
which gives rise to a low-salinity plume moving over a lower salty layer, and
2. Inertia-driven ﬂow of river water into a reservoir such as a lake or sea, known as a jet.
Instabilities commonly develop at the interface between different ﬂuids as a result of
interfacial shear. These instabilities may grow into vortices that draw in ambient ﬂuid,
causing mixing of the two ﬂuid masses. Alternatively, instabilities may be damped by the
density contrast of two ﬂuid masses. Consequently, mixing is fundamentally important to
sediment deposition since mixing leads to a reduction of the density differences that drive
ﬂuid motion and keep sediment grains suspended, mixing leads to ﬂow expansion by the
entrainment of one ﬂuid mass into the other, causing deceleration, and mixing may also
cause geochemical changes leading to precipitation and ﬂocculation.
131
.006
15:07:16

132
The Continental Shelf Segment
The simplest case of mixing is when a narrow jet of ﬂuid enters a large, deep reservoir.
The jet expands into a conical shape and mixes with the ambient ﬂuid. If the reservoir, such
as a lake, is deep, the jet is unaffected by solid boundaries and is axisymmetric. If there
is no entrainment across the boundaries of the jet, ﬂuid in the jet decelerates rapidly with
distance travelled x, so that the mean velocity ˆU varies inversely with the square of x. If
ambient ﬂuid is drawn in, the mean velocity of the ﬂuid in the jet decelerates less rapidly,
with ˆU varying simply inversely with x. Jets become progressively diluted with ambient
ﬂuid as they spread away from the outlet.
However, although the simple axisymmetric jet model might apply to an eruption col-
umn from a volcano, it is unlikely to apply to the conditions at river mouths except for
rivers entering deep, steep-sided lakes, such as the Rhein River efﬂuent in Lake Constance
(Müller, 1966; Allen, 1997). Instead, it is more common for the jet to be unable to spread
freely in all directions due to the presence of a shallow bottom boundary comprising the
sea bed. Incorporation of sea bed friction leads to marked lateral expansion and rapid
deceleration of the plane jet, causing sediment to be spread laterally in a narrow zone close
to the shoreline.
The mixing of fresh and salty water where rivers enter the sea results in buoyancy-
driven outﬂows and generally takes place in estuaries that deeply indent the shoreline.
Estuaries are not passive funnels through which sediment is passed en route for the ocean.
They are dynamic entities in which complex physical and chemical changes take place.
Their mixing behaviour has a profound inﬂuence on the seaward extrusion of low-salinity
plumes onto the continental shelf. The presence of a salinity and therefore density gradient
along the estuary results in a pressure difference that drives a seaward ﬂow of low-salinity
water over a deeper landward ﬂow of saline water. Tidal ﬂows cause a mixing of the
water masses of different salinity, so estuaries may be of ‘salt wedge’ or ‘stratiﬁed’ type
characterised by a seaward low-salinity plume over an intruding salt water wedge, or
‘mixed’, or ‘partially mixed’ where the stratiﬁcation in completely or incompletely broken
down.
If estuaries are wide enough, the seaward and landward ﬂows may be separated by the
topography of channels and shoals, with the Coriolis force causing a deﬂection to the
right of low-salinity outﬂowing water and landward ﬂowing salty water in the northern
hemisphere, when looking down the ﬂow direction.
Salt wedge intrusion may extend considerable distances up river channels. During low-
discharge conditions of the Mississippi River, a salt wedge extends more than 300 km
upstream from its mouth. Under high discharge conditions, however, the salt wedge is
pushed entirely out of the estuary and sediment-laden river water ﬂows into the Gulf of
Mexico as a plume that is recognised as far as the continental edge 50 km from shore. In
the case of the Amazon River, low-salinity water is found as much as 1,000 km from the
river mouth. Flow of the plume is caused by lateral pressure gradients set up by the density
contrast with the underlying water, so mixing reduces the effectiveness of the buoyancy-
driven ﬂow.

5.1 Dynamics at River Mouths
133
A wide range of marine processes potentially modify the outﬂow dynamics of turbu-
lent jet inertia and buoyancy-driven ﬂow, including internal waves, coastal and nearshore
currents, wind-driven ocean currents, thermal stratiﬁcation and the presence of sea ice, but
chief of which are:
1. Tidal currents: an index of the strength of tidal currents is the tidal range of the sea into
which the rivers enters. Powerful currents are found in macrotidal seas (range in excess
of 4 m) and commonly exceed the speed of the river, as in the delta of the Ganges–
Brahmaputra in the Bay of Bengal, the Klang of Malaysia and the Ord of northern
Australia.
2. Surface gravity waves: regions of small fetch and with shallow offshore slopes that
attenuate wave energy by friction tend to have low wave energy at the coast. However,
outﬂows that enter large seas with steep offshore slopes, such as that of the Senegal
delta, western Africa, may be strongly modiﬁed by waves, enhancing mixing of plumes
and redistributing deposited sediment shorewards and alongshore. The strength of the
inertial ﬂow relative to wave energy is expressed as a discharge effectiveness index
(Wright and Coleman, 1973).
Delta morphology and sediment budgets are therefore strongly affected by outﬂow
dynamics. In particular, wave action redistributes sediment provided by river discharge.
Low river discharges relative to wave power causes sediment reworking into a wave-
dominated conﬁguration of linear shorelines with barriers, spits and aeolian dunes, as is
typical of examples such as the Sao Francisco and Senegal deltas (Wright and Coleman,
1972). Where the river discharge is large compared to wave power, efﬂuent-dominated
conﬁgurations result, forming prograding digitate distributaries, and indented shorelines
with marshes and bays, as in the Mississippi delta. Oblique wave approach intensiﬁes
longshore drift and forces the delta to be asymmetrical, with pronounced differences in
morphology and sedimentary facies on the updrift and downdrift sides of the river efﬂuent
(Komar, 1973; Bhattacharya and Giosan, 2003; Weiguo, Bhattacharya, and Yingmin,
2011). An asymmetry index is deﬁned as
A = QL
QR
(5.1)
where QL is the net longshore transport rate in m3 yr−1 and QR is the river discharge in
106 m3 yr−1. Symmetrical deltas, such as the Tiber in Italy and Ebro in Spain, have values
of A < 200, whereas asymmetrical deltas such as the Danube, Black Sea and Brazos, Gulf
Coast United States, have values of A > 200.
The strength of the river efﬂuent can be assumed to be given by the river discharge
per unit width of river mouth, which can be estimated from gauging station records. The
strength of waves in the receiving basin can be assumed to be related to the wave power
per unit width of wave crest, but its measurement is problematical. At what water depth
should wave power be calculated, and is sufﬁcient intrumentation deployed off the world’s
major deltas? To circumvent these problems, deep water (water motion unaffected by the

friction of the sea bed) wave characteristics can be calculated from published records of
wind data. These deep water wave conditions are then used to compute the effects of
shoaling, refraction and frictional attenuation. Wave power is calculated at decrements
of water depth from deep water to the shoreline. The discharge effectiveness index
is then
DEI = QR
PW
(5.2)
where QR is the average river discharge per unit channel width with dimensions of
[L3T−1] and PW is the average nearshore power per unit width of wave crest with
dimensions of [ML2T−3]. Consequently DEI has dimensions of [M−1LT−2] and absolute
values have no physical meaning. Nevertheless, modern deltas can be ranked according
to their value of DEI (Table 5.1). Values for modern deltas range from the highly
river-dominated Mississippi delta (DEI > 105) to the wave-dominated Senegal delta
(DEI < 1) (Figure 5.1). Homewood and Allen (1981) carried out an analysis of a
lower Miocene shallow marine succession in the Molasse of western Switzerland that
enabled them to compare their Miocene example with modern deltas in terms of outﬂow
dynamics.
Delta morphology is correlated with the value of DEI rather than with absolute values
of river discharge or deep water wave power. Deep-water waves lose their power due to
frictional attenuation on the sea bed, which depends on the subaqueous slope (Figure 5.1a).
Shallow slopes cause greater frictional attenuation of wave power, whereas steep subaque-
ous proﬁles allow strong waves to impact the nearshore zone. Consequently, the shallow
sloping linear or slightly convex seabed proﬁle of the Mississippi delta causes low wave

slope and delta morphology therefore depend on the supply of sediment by rivers relative
to the ability of waves to redistribute it. Redistribution of sediment by waves results in
sediment transport in littoral cells parallel to the coast and therefore inﬂuences the pathway
followed by sediment en route to the deep sea (Section 6.2).

and relatively low marine power, such as the Vistula and Indigirka. Quadrant (c) has relatively high
supply rates and high marine power and is unpopulated. Quadrant (d) is characterised by relatively
low sediment supply rates and high marine power, and contains the bulk of the world’s major

The grain size of the topset (overbank) deposits is calculated for 19 of the 51 deltas
in the Syvitski and Saito (2007) database. A power law relationship is found between
river mainstem length L in km and the mean size D in mm of the suspended load
(Table 5.3)
D = 18.47L−0.681
(5.7)
with a considerable amount of scatter (R2 = 0.584) (Figure 5.3). In essence, long rivers
feed ﬁne sediment to delta topsets (as in the Amazon, Orinoco and Mekong), and short
rivers feed relatively coarse sediment to the delta topset (as in the Waipaoa and Po). Down-
stream grain-size ﬁning is controlled in part by the extraction from the sediment load by
selective deposition (Section 9.4). Consequently, some of the variation seen in Figure 5.3
is undoubtedly caused by variations in the tectonic subsidence generating accommodation
in the catchment-ﬂuvial segment.

The Continental Shelf Segment
5.2 Natural Range of Deltaic and Subaqueous Clinoforms
Sediment delivered to the ocean by rivers is commonly preserved in basinward-dipping
architectures known as clinoforms (Patruno, Hampson, and Jackson, 2015). Clinoforms
occur over a range of vertical scales, from tens to thousands of metres, and comprise, in a
proximal to distal direction, (1) subaerial deltas, (2) subaqueous deltas, (3) shelf prisms and
(4) continental margins (Helland-Hansen and Gjelberg, 2012). Subaerial and subaqueous
clinoforms have vertical relief of tens of metres, whereas shelf-prisms consist of clinoforms
of 100–500 m vertical relief, and the clinoforms that build continental margins may be
several thousands of metres in relief (Figure 5.4).

5.3 Simple Models of Delta Progradation

Delta-scale clinoforms may be subaerial (with shorelines behind which are delta top
and coastal plain deposits) or subaqueous (with submarine topsets dominated by sediment
bypass across the inner shelf). Subaerial deltas are affected by river discharge, and are there-
fore oriented normally or radially from the coastline, whereas sediment transport in sub-
aqueous clinoforms in shallow marine environments is dominated by ocean basin dynamics
(waves, tides, currents), which orients them parallel to the alongshore advective transport
direction. Subaerial and subaqueous delta-scale clinoforms commonly occur together and
take part in the same sediment routing system, as in the western Adriatic and western
Yellow Sea. Such instances are known as compound clinoforms (Nittrouer et al., 1996).
Each delta has a clinoform rollover, marking the point of gradient change from topset
to foreset, which corresponds to the shoreline in subaerial clinoforms and the shelf-slope
break in subaqueous clinoforms (Figure 5.4). The trajectory of the shoreline and shelf-
slope break is an indicator of the dynamics of delta growth. Progradation rates of subaerial
and subaqueous clinoforms are highly variable. In the Ganges–Brahmaputra system, the
subaerial delta is prograding very slowly, whereas the subaqueous delta is prograding
rapidly at 10 m yr−1 (Kuehl et al., 1997). In general, rivers entering marine basins with high
energy (tidal range and wave energy) have well-developed subaqueous deltas, as in the Bay
of Bengal, Papua New Guinea and the Amazon shelf, whereas those entering low-energy
marine basins, such as the Gulf of Mexico, have poorly developed subaqueous deltas.
5.3 Simple Models of Delta Progradation
Kenyon and Turcotte (1985) developed a theoretical 2-dimensional model for the progra-
dation of a river delta where the delta front moves by bulk transport, as in creep induced by
wave loading, debris ﬂow and shallow landsliding. Deposition on the delta slope is treated
as diffusive, analogously to the creep of soil, in which case the change in the elevation of
the sea bed, ignoring the porosity of sea bed sediments, is given by the familiar law of
conservation of mass (Fick’s law):
∂h
∂t = K ∂2h
∂x2
(5.8)
where h is the elevation above base level, such as the sea bed in front of the delta, x is
the horizontal distance, t is time, and K is a sediment transport coefﬁcient equivalent to
the diffusivity κ. Equation (5.8)) can be solved for the case of steady progradation using
a coordinate system that moves with the landward edge of the delta front. The length
coordinate becomes
x∗= x −Ut
(5.9)
where U is the progradation speed, and t is the time coordinate. If the shape of the delta
front is constant as it progrades, equation (5.8) can be solved for the new coordinate system
to give

The sea-bed elevation of the delta front therefore decreases exponentially with distance
from the shoreline (Figure 5.5). In order to allow comparison with observations on mod-
ern and ancient clinoform stratigraphic geometries, we need to obtain solutions for the
slope or the increment of volume of sediment on the delta front per unit time, which
is the sediment supply rate. Equation (5.12) can be differentiated to give a solution for

Consequently, information on the shape and progradation rate of deltaic clinoforms can be

Kenyon and Turcotte (1985) compared their theory with observations on three major
deltas: the Fraser River delta in British Columbia; the Rhein delta in Lake Constance
(Bodensee), Switzerland-Germany; and the Mississippi delta at Southwest Pass, Gulf of
Mexico (Table 5.4). In each case, the wave and tidal energy in the receiving basin are small
and bathymetric slopes are steep, so the river efﬂuents act primarily as inertial jets.
An alternative way to explain the subaqueous slope of deltas is to continue to treat
the transport and deposition as diffusive, that is, the sediment ﬂux is proportional to the
bathymetric gradient, but to use a solution identical to that of the instantaneous cooling of
a semi-inﬁnite half-space (Allen and Allen, 2013)(appendix 48, p.541). Assuming a steady

We take the example of the Rhein delta in Lake Constance (Bodensee). The entry point
of the Rhein River into the lake was artiﬁcially changed in the year 1900. The outlet is 200
m wide with a water depth of 4 m. The present-day average annual sediment discharge is
1.8 Mt, giving an average annual discharge per unit width of approximately 3330 m2 yr−1.
Since 1900 the delta has advanced steadily into the lake. There is little riverine sediment
beyond 3 km from the present-position of the river mouth. This is in good agreement with
the simulation of delta proﬁles using the heat transport equation with an annual steady
advance of the outlet of 33 m, which results in an outlet position of x = 2 km after 61 years
of progradation.
The relationship of clinoform geometry to the controlling factors of subsidence and sea
level change, as well as to the magnitude of the sediment supply, can be explored using
a kinematic wave approximation (Petter et al., 2013). Shelf-margin accretion in clinoform
wedges has been used as a proxy for sediment ﬂux (Carvajal, Steel, and Petter, 2009) by
using the horizontal and vertical components of the shelf-edge trajectory (Figure 5.7). The
progradation rate of the shelf edge, and the delivery of sediment to the deep sea, are both
related to modern river loads (Wetzel, 1993; Carvajal, Steel, and Petter, 2009). Shelf-margin
clinoforms are envisaged as comprising sigmoidal sediment bodies with topsets, foresets
and bottomsets fed from a riverine or littoral sediment source. Sediment is transported
across the foreset by shallow marine processes such as waves, tides and storms, or by

progradation of the deltaic shoreline to the shelf edge (Burgess and Hovius, 1998). The
very large volumes of sediment required to drive shelf-margin growth, which are evident
from study of ancient continental margins, indicate that deltas must directly feed the upper
part of the continental margin slope (Steel et al., 2009).
The kinematic wave equation expresses the change in elevation over time as proportional
to the local topographic (bathymetric) slope by the speed of the wave form, or celerity C:
∂h
∂t = −C

(5.18)
where C is equivalent to the progradation rate of the shelf-margin. Equation (5.18) requires
that an increase in deposition rate is necessary to maintain a constant celerity on clinoforms
with steeper slopes. Since we know from the Exner equation (Paola and Voller, 2005)

The term A(x)dx is a sink term representing the sediment aggradation necessary to keep
pace with subsidence and sea level change while maintaining clinoform geometry. It is
therefore the threshold ﬂux necessary for progradation.
If the shelf margin progrades at some rate Pi into a basin with a gently dipping sea
ﬂoor and with rising relative sea level, the clinoforms are forced to increase their height
and length. In order for the progradation rate to stay constant, the sediment ﬂux must
increase to satisfy the sediment volume requirements of the new clinoform (Petter et al.,
2013). Alternatively, if the sediment ﬂux stays constant, the progradation rate will decrease
as the shelf margin progrades into deeper water. Taking clinoform data from clinoform 8
of the Cretaceous Lewis margin, Washakie Basin, Wyoming, United States and from the
Cretaceous Colville Trough, North Slope, Alaska (Carvajal and Steel, 2006; Petter et al.,
2013), the shelf-edge unit width sediment ﬂux can be simply calculated (Table 5.5). The
relationship between sediment ﬂux and clinoform proﬁle for clinothem 8 of the Lewis
margin is shown in Figure 5.8.
The large-scale curvature of clinoforms comprising the continental slope (linear/planar,
exponential/concave, sigmoidal, convex) can be related to the slope angle, sediment com-
position, transport mechanisms and hydrodynamic regime (Adams and Schlager, 2000).

Linear proﬁles are thought to be caused by sediments resting at their angle of repose,
whereas exponential proﬁles in siliciclastic systems are generated by an exponential decay
with increasing distance of the capacity of the gravity-controlled transport mechanisms.
Sigmoidal proﬁles result from modiﬁcation of exponential forms by extrinsic factors such
as basel level change and action of ocean currents. In the case of the Ebro clinoforms
(Figure 5.9), sigmoidal proﬁles correspond to unmodiﬁed slopes while exponential geome-
tries result from a modiﬁcation of the original shape of the slope by erosional processes
(Kertznus and Kneller, 2009).
The submarine Ebro continental margin is characterised by a series of progradational
clinoforms in the 1–1.5 km-thick Pliocene-Pleistocene succession, deposited since the end
of the Messinian salinity crisis (Figure 5.9). The margin is fed with sediment from the Ebro
Basin, which since the Tortonian (late Miocene) has been connected to the Mediterranean
Sea (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2003). The drainage area of the modern Ebro Basin is 85,820
km2, whereas the modern Ebro delta has a total area of just 2,170 km2, of which 320 km2
is subaerial. Much of the sediment is delivered by the Ebro River (‘natural’ or ‘pristine’
values of 18 Mt yr−1, 0.15 Mt yr−1 for ‘anthropogenic’ values). Subaerial exposure of
the margins surrounding the Mediterranean Sea during the Messinian caused deep incision
by river systems, generating a distinctive unconformity. Global sea level rose in the early
Pliocene at 5.3 Ma re-establishing marine conditions in the Mediterranean basin, but Plio-
Pleistocene sedimentation was strongly inﬂuenced by the relief generated in the Messinian
desiccation event. The Plio-Pleistocene succession is divided into three packages separated

Sediment ﬂuxes at the shelf edge increase from the Pliocene seismic package 1 through
the early Pleistocene seismic package 2 to the late Pleistocene seismic package 3. The
increase in sediment supply at the end of the Pliocene, combined with a wider shelf in
the Pleistocene, which allowed more effective redistribution of sediment, and accommo-
dation created by compaction of the underlying sediment prism, resulted in increasing
clinoform height, average slope and shelf margin relief. The sediment ﬂux values for the
Plio-Pleistocene can also be compared with the sediment load of the Ebro delta. Taking
the pristine value of 18 Mt yr−1, and assuming that the Ebro River is the sole source of
sediment along a 150 km stretch of shelf margin, we obtain a unit width sediment delivery
of 45 m2 yr−1. This indicates that the Ebro River at its current sediment discharge is capable
of building the clinoforms observed on the continental margin.
The method of calculating depositional sediment ﬂuxes proposed by Petter et al. (2013)
has the advantage that it requires minimal data from 2D data sets and full information on the
.006

The Continental Shelf Segment
geometry of the clinoform is not needed. The depositional sediment ﬂux can be calculated
as a function of basinward distance, as has been carried out on the Maastrichtian Lewis
margin of the Washakie Basin, Wyoming (Carvajal and Steel, 2006). The average deposi-
tional ﬂux at the shelf edge is 8.8 Mt yr−1 based on analysis of clinoforms, compared to a
range of 4−16 Mt yr−1 based on estimates of the volume of basin stratigraphy. Depositional
ﬂuxes decrease from the rollover basinwards, principally due to upstream deposition in the
sediment routing system.
Present-day continental margins are thought to export from less than 10% to 90% of
their sediment supply off the shelf into deeper water (Walsh and Nittrouer, 2003), with the
wide variation dependent mostly on shelf width. If rivers enter the ocean a short distance
from the shelf edge, a high proportion of the sediment supply is discharged into deeper
water. Petter et al. (2013) (ﬁg.12, p.591) estimated the fraction of the total sediment supply
deposited beyond the shelf edge for three Neogene continental margins (Ebro, Zambezi and
New Jersey). They found that approximately 60 −70% of the sediment supply reached the
shelf edge over the timescale represented by these three examples, supporting the estimates
of the partitioning of sediment into topset, slope and basin-ﬂoor of 1:1:1 in the Washakie
Basin (Carvajal and Steel, 2012). If these ﬁndings are of generic value, it would represent
a useful, simple tool for estimating sediment export to the deep ocean.
Pirmez, Pratson, and Steckler (1998) related clinoform growth to the distribution of
shear stresses on the sea bed seaward of the river mouth coupled to suspended sediment
transport. The distribution of sedimentation rate varies from low in the erosive topset
region, to high on the sloping foresets, and low again in the distant bottomsets. This vari-
ability of sedimentation rate is captured in the model by shear stresses in shallow water
being too high to allow deposition, so sediment bypasses the topset region. With increas-
ing water depth, shear stresses on the sea bed reduce, allowing foreset deposition, with
decreasing rates of accumulation as water depth increases.
Swenson et al. (2005) related clinoform development to the relative strength of river
ﬂoods and basin hydrodynamics represented by tidal and storm wave power. They were
able to simulate compound clinoform geometries involving both subaerial and subaqueous
progradation. Increasing the frequency or magnitude of coastal storms, decreasing ﬂood
frequency or river discharge, and reducing grain size all have the effect of increasing
the fraction of the sediment supply delivered to the shallow marine environment, which
in turn controls the extent of subaqueous delta progradation relative to subaerial delta
development. Swenson et al. (2005) modelled compound clinoform development using
an impulse function with characteristic events of certain amplitude and intermittency
to approximate the unsteady river discharge, and the wave height of breakers and the
strength of downwelling currents caused by coastal set-up to approximate the energy of the
receiving marine basin. The magnitude and frequency of ﬂoods on land and storms at sea
control the partitioning of sediment between the subaerial and subaqueous deltas, which
in turn controls their growth or progradation rates. Linked subaerial and subaqueous deltas
therefore vary in growth rates, posing problems for the interpretation of relative sea level
from clinoform geometry. When river ﬂoods dominate over coastal storms, clinoforms

are of the simple Gilbert-type, as in the case of the Mississippi River delta (Figure 5.10).
Compound clinoforms are found at intermediate positions, and purely subaqueous deltas
are found in regions of coastal storm dominance, such as the Columbia River delta in the
northeastern United States.
5.4 Sediment Transport on the Shelf
Of the total discharge of sediment generated by erosion in source area catchments, only a
portion reaches the deep sea. In order to reach the deep abyssal plains of the oceans, sed-
iment must be transported from river mouths across the continental shelf. The continental
shelf has an average gradient of 0.1◦, with an oceanward termination in water depths of
130–200 m. This means that during the LGM, when sea levels were lower than today’s by
.006

The Continental Shelf Segment
approximately 130 m, many of the world’s continental shelves were subaerially exposed.
On passive (stretched) continental margins, the continental slope, which has an average
gradient of 3−6◦, passes distally into the ﬂat (average slope of less than 0.1◦) abyssal plains
at water depths of greater than 4, 000 m. On active (convergent) margins, the continental
shelf is narrower and sediment supply rates from steep mountainous catchments are higher
than on passive margins.
Sediment transport on the continental shelf involves a complex set of physical oceano-
graphic processes set up by a combination of plume buoyancy, tidal currents, wave action
and gravity ﬂow. The fate of sediment entering the ocean depends on a number of factors
(Ma, 2009):
1. Deposition of a progradational delta, which takes place where high sediment discharges
enter a wide, gently dipping continental shelf of low energy as in the Mississippi River
(Coleman, Roberts, and Stone, 1998) and Yellow River (Huang He) deltas (Bornhold
et al., 1986).
2. Bypass of the inner shelf and deposition on the middle shelf is favoured by high riverine
sediment supply and a highly energetic coastal zone. Sediment accumulates as subaque-
ous clinoforms offshore of the river mouth. Sediment bodies are elongated along the
shelf by vigorous coastal currents, while sediment is also transported across-shelf down
clinoform surfaces by gravity ﬂows (Friedrichs and Wright, 1986). Sediment dispersal
of this type is common, including in the regions offshore the Amazon, Yangtze and Fly
rivers.
3. Wide dispersal of sediment to the mid-outer shelf by energetic waves and tidal cur-
rents acting on fresh-water plumes. Fine sediments settling out from plumes are com-
monly resuspended and driven across the shelf as gravity-driven turbid layers (Harris,
Traykovski, and Geyer, 2005). Examples are the continental shelves offshore the Eel
River of the United States Paciﬁc margin, and the Waiapu and Waiapoa rivers of New
Zealand.
4. Escape of sediment from the shelf system through capture by submarine canyons incised
into the continental slope and shelf. Canyons may extend across the shelf to the river
mouth, as is the case of the Sepik River, Papua New Guinea (Walsh and Nittrouer, 2003).
Capture of the sediment cascade by submarine canyons is favoured by tectonically
active, narrow shelves, such as of the California Borderland, but capture may also take
place where relative sea level fall has caused strong incision at lowstands when conti-
nental shelves were subaerially exposed. Canyons are important in funnelling sediment
to the deep sea off the Eel River, Congo River and Ganga-Brahmaputra (Section 6.2).
These possibilities of sediment dispersal can be further illustrated by a selection of
examples.
• In the case of the Ganges–Brahmaputra system (Goodbred and Kuehl, 1999) (Figure
5.11), 30% of the total sediment supply from the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers (1,060
Mt yr−1) is deposited in the ﬂoodplains and delta-plain areas. Of the sediment that enters

the total budget that is transported to the deep-water Bengal Fan through the Swatch of
No Ground Canyon.
• The Changjiang (Yangtze) River delivers approximately 500 Mt of sediment (mostly
silt and ﬁner) annually into the South China Sea (Milliman et al., 1985) (Figure 5.12).
Over the last 2 to 3 thousand years, 5% of this sediment load has been sequestered in
progradation of the shoreline and a further up to 40% has been deposited in the river
estuary, chieﬂy in South Channel. About half of the riverine sediment supply therefore
escapes from the delta region and is entrained in the north-south ﬂowing Jiangsu Coastal
Current. The sediment load of the coastal current causes accretion of the inner shelf,
leaving ∼30% of the riverine supply that is exported further southward.
• The Rhone River delivers 7 to 20 × 106 m3 of sediment each year into the western
Mediterranean Sea, through two outlets, the Grand Rhone and the Petit Rhone (Sabatier
et al., 2006) (Figure 5.13). Sediment escaping from the river mouths is entrained in

the termini of sediment transport vectors inﬂuenced by the physiography of the coastline.
Part of the riverine sediment supply is advected into deeper water depths. A similar
picture of ocean sediment dynamics is found along the Catalonian (Durán et al., 2012)
and Languedoc-Roussillon (Brunel et al., 2014) coasts to the west of the Rhone delta.
The Llobregat River is the main supplier of sediment to the Catalan coast northeast
of Barcelona, with an annual discharge of 100 × 103 yr−1. A portion of the sediment
from the Llobregat catchment and the other smaller catchments draining the Coastal
Catalan Chain (Figure 5.14) descends into submarine canyons that incise deeply into the
continental shelf. Other sediment participates in littoral cells close to the shore, whereas
the Northern Current ﬂows along the shelf edge approximately 20 km offshore.
5.5 River Plumes and Dispersal Scaling
Large rivers commonly produce buoyant hypopycnal outﬂows into the coastal ocean, since
fresh water is less dense than saline. In buoyant outﬂows, fresh water ﬂows oceanward
above a salt water wedge. The landward limit of the salt intrusion is commonly a turbidity

maximum and the site of sediment deposition. In some cases, however, such as the Yellow
River (Wang et al., 2006), and a large number of steep, mountainous rivers, the high
sediment concentration of the efﬂuent produces hyperpycnal outﬂows that hug the sea
bed. The mode of delivery of sediment to the coastal ocean is therefore inﬂuenced by the
buoyancy of outﬂows.
The balance between the river efﬂuent and the salt water intrusion (the balance between
turbulent jet diffusion and buoyant outﬂow) can be expressed by the densimetric Froude
Number (F′)
F′ =
U

g′h′
(5.24)
where g prime is a ‘reduced’ or density-modiﬁed gravity, U is the mean efﬂuent outﬂow
velocity and h′ is the thickness of the plume at the river mouth, so is the depth to the
density interface. When inertial forces are dominant (F′ high) the outﬂow approximates
the turbulent jet model, whereas buoyancy dominates when F′ is small. For the same river
water density, buoyancy is favoured by cold seawater and concentrated water such as the
brines of an enclosed sea or lake, whereas turbulent jets are favoured by warm seawater.
Sediment is trapped near the salinity front deﬁning the leading edge of the plume. The
position of the salinity front depends on outﬂow velocity and geometry, and the strength of
wave activity and tidal currents in the receiving marine basin. Outﬂows with high velocities
can push the salinity front far offshore, as in the case of the Amazon outﬂow. The frontal
zone is sharp and the plume is well stratiﬁed where the receiving water body is deep
and winds, waves and tides are weak (as in the case of the Sepik River), but where the
receiving basin is shallow, with strong winds, waves and tides, enhanced mixing results in
a broad frontal zone extending far from the river mouth (as in the case of the Amazon and
Changjiang (Yangtze) rivers. The efﬁciency of sediment trapping is illustrated by the length
scale L
L = U
ws
h′
(5.25)
where ws is the sediment settling velocity. Large amounts of sediment are trapped when
the width of the frontal zone is greater than L, but when the frontal zone is sharper and less
than L, coarse sediment is deposited, whereas ﬁne sediment bypasses the frontal zone and
is advected by ocean currents, typically in an along-shelf direction.
River plumes are affected by the rotation of the Earth. The river plume beyond the
salinity front broadens and slows down, with a width that scales on the inverse of the
Coriolis parameter f
R′ =

(5.26)
where R′ is the Rossby deformation radius and the Coriolis force per unit mass is the
product of the Coriolis parameter and the horizontal velocity of the parcel of ﬂuid. At
scales greater than R′ the river plume is deﬂected to the right or left in the northern and

southern hemispheres respectively. If the plume velocity is in the same direction as the
ambient oceanic current, the plume extends for a long distance away from the river mouth
and may create a coastal mud wedge, as in the case of the Amazon plume (Geyer, Hill, and
Kineke, 2004), the Changjiang (Yangtze) plume in winter (Milliman et al., 1985) and the
western Adriatic supplied principally by the Po River (Brommer et al., 2009).
Although plumes generated by some of the world’s major rivers, such as the Amazon and
Mississippi, are well known, a signiﬁcant contribution to the coastal and shelfal sediment
budget, and therefore also to the biogeochemistry and productivity of coastal waters, is from
many small mountainous rivers. River plumes during high-discharge ﬂood events initially
have enough inertia to disperse as a thin (1–10 m), extensive (from 1 to thousands of km2)
hypopycnal jet. Since rivers have self-similar scaling of their geomorphological and hydro-
logical properties, a ﬁrst-order assumption is that there will be power law (fractal) relation-
ships between river catchment attributes and plume dispersal (Warrick and Fong, 2004).
In other words, if river plume surface area is Ap and catchment area is Ac, we can write
Ap = cAb
c
(5.27)
and the number of plumes with area greater than Ac = i is
Ni = aA−β
p
(5.28)
where the coefﬁcients a and c, and the exponents b and β are derived from regional or
global compilations.
Plume areas can be assessed from satellite imagery of turbidity fronts following river
ﬂooding. For example, river plumes off the Moroccan coast varied in area from 21 to 1,100
km2 and when compared to catchment areas gave a power law slope b of 0.6 (Figure 5.15).
This is similar to the exponent (b=0.63) derived from small Californian catchments and
plumes (Ap of 1–230 km2). Incorporating data from the ﬂoods of major world rivers gives
b = 0.68. The Californian size-frequency data give a power law scale β of very close to 1
(Figure 5.15).
The dispersal of river plumes can also be approached from laboratory experiments
(Fischer et al., 1979), which show that plume dispersal is a function of the ﬂuid ﬂuxes
of mass, momentum and buoyancy. The plume can be described by a mass ﬂux length
scale (lQ), which characterises the zone of ﬂow establishment near the river mouth and a
momentum length scale (lM), which characterises the offshore transition from momentum-
dominated to buoyancy-dominated forcing. Making the approximation that the plume area
is the square of the length scale gives
AQ = Q/V
(5.29)
for the mass ﬂux length scale, and
AM = Q1/2V3/2(g
′)−1
(5.30)
for the momentum length scale, where AQ and AM are the plume areas associated with the
mass ﬂux and momentum length scales, Q and V are the discharge and average velocity

water compared to ocean water, which is normally a few percent of g. Within a region
of relatively uniform geomorphology and hydrology, river discharge and velocity can be
related to catchment area using well-known scaling relationships. Dunne and Leopold
(1978) suggested that Q is roughly proportional to A0.85

the satellite data. The value of b for the area associated with the inshore, mass ﬂux length
scale is twice the value of b for the area associated with the offshore, momentum length
scale. The slope of the power law relation between Ac and Ap therefore decreases with
distance from the river mouth on the basis of laboratory experiments. A seaward decrease
in b is also found in numerical models of plume dispersal in the absence of tides, waves
and ocean currents.
The signiﬁcance of b < 1 is that the combination of many small rivers spread their
fresh water and suspended sediment over a wider cumulative area than does one large river
with the same total drainage area. This is due to the fact that small, mountainous rivers
have higher rates of ﬂuid mass ﬂux and momentum per unit area of catchment. Small,
mountainous rivers have been shown to have relatively high sediment yields (Milliman and
Syvitski, 1992). Since the inclusion of data from some of the world’s largest plumes, which
have different forcing mechanisms, still gives b < 1, the patterns of plume size are assumed
to be global.
5.6 The Bottom Boundary Layer
The boundary layer is the region where the velocity is affected by the frictional resistance
of the boundary and is therefore characterised by a high velocity gradient. Waves are par-
ticularly effective at stirring up sediment because of the high velocity gradients generated
in their reversing, thin boundary layer. The continental shelf boundary layer is affected
by a combination of wave oscillation and quasi-steady currents (Grant and Madsen, 1979)
driven by tides or wind stress.
Some continental shelves have seaward-ﬁning sands graded by the action of shoaling
waves, passing into mid-shelf muds below wave base, at water depths of 20−30 m. The
Roussillon-Languedoc shelf of the western Golfe du Lion (France) is an example (Jago
and Barusseau, 1981). The shelf is incised by submarine canyons to a depth of about 100
m, and has a nearshore sand prism extending to a water depth of 20 m that merges gradually
into a mid-shelf mud blanket extending between water depths of 30 m and 80 m. The shelf
is microtidal. Wind-driven waves have a mean wave period of 4.2 s and a mean height of
0.5 m. The wave power exerted on a unit area of sea bed by the tangential stress of waves is
ω = CDρ
4
3u3
m

(5.31)
where CD is a drag coefﬁcient, um is the maximum near-bed orbital velocity due to waves
and ρ is the density of sea water. By summing wave power estimates for all waves at any
depth, and repeating the computation at successive depths, a wave power proﬁle is obtained
that can be compared with the seaward ﬁning of the grain-size proﬁle (Figure 5.16). The
two data sets show a similar nearshore-offshore proﬁle, suggesting that waves are primarily
responsible for the textural changes in the nearshore sand prism.
For grain sizes of less than 0.5mm, the threshold of sediment motion under waves using
linear (Airy) wave theory is given by (Komar and Miller, 1973):

where H, L and T are the height, wavelength and period of the surface waves respectively,

the threshold of sediment motion for typical wave conditions can be plotted against water
depth and compared with the observed shore-normal grain-size data (Figure 5.17).
The oscillatory motion of surface waves is transferred to the sea bed above wave base,
causing sediment to be agitated by each half cycle of wave motion (Figure 5.18). The wave
base therefore depends on wave conditions and sediment grain size and extends to the outer
shelf for small storms (wind speed of 8 m s−1, wave height of 2 m and wave period of 10 s)
and to the upper continental slope for large storms (wind speed 20 m s−1, wave height of
6 m and wave period of 15 s). Waves interact with the steady geostrophic currents set up
by wind stress and acted upon by the Coriolis force, causing the current to veer to the right
in the northern hemisphere. The onshore component of the resulting Ekman layer causes
coastal set-up. The gradient of the water surface drives an offshore ‘slope’ or ‘gradient’
current that also veers to the right in the northern hemisphere, leading to a geostrophic ﬂow

Although the predicted threshold grain size from linear wave theory shows a simi-
lar onshore-offshore trend to the observed mean grain size on the Languedoc-Roussillon
continental shelf, the calculated textural gradient is steeper than those observed in the ﬁeld.
This may be due to a number of factors, including the effect of variable wave conditions
in causing sediment transport. Similar rates of seaward ﬁning in sands have been found on

other wave-graded continental shelves, such as that of the Adriatic Sea (Passega, Rizzini,
and Borghetti, 1967) and the southeastern Australian shelf (Grifﬁn, Hemer, and Jones,
2008).
Shoaling waves transform as they enter shallowing water so that linear wave theory
no longer correctly describes the wave motion. Under shoaling waves the orbits of water
particles become asymmetrical, resulting in a shoreward mass transport or ’Stokes drift’.
However, comparison of the simple linear theory with Stokes theory indicates that the
effects of shoaling transformations on grain size are relatively small.
The sediment transport on the continental shelf by wind and waves can be predicted
by solving horizontal momentum equations for along-shelf and cross-shelf transport
(Cookman and Flemings, 2001; Harris and Wiberg, 2001; Syvitski and Hutton, 2001). The
sediment transport on an idealised, two-dimensional continental shelf can be solved for
steady wind and wave forcing of the ﬂow ﬁeld using, for example, the STORMSED1.0
program of Cookman and Flemings (2001). Such a sediment transport model helps the
geologist to understand better the formation of marine sedimentary successions, but also
aids the assessment of the sediment routing from the coast to the absorbing states of the
continental margin and deep sea. The model links three components: (1) a circulation
model driven by steady wind conditions that apply a wind stress to the water surface, (2) a
wave model, and (3) a sediment transport model.
The combined wave-current boundary layer is used to solve for the erosion, transport
and deposition of a single-sized sediment, initially with a wind that causes downwelling
currents. For the small and large storms modelled, ﬁne sand is transported in shallow water
depths as bedload, whereas medium and coarse silt is transported as suspended load. The
zone of increasing sediment ﬂux, which corresponds to a zone of erosion, includes almost
the entire shelf for the case of large storms (Figure 5.19).
With multiple grain sizes and small storms, the locations of sediment ﬂux peaks, which
correspond to the change from erosion to deposition, shift from a few kilometers offshore
for medium sand to 30 km offshore for medium silt. At the same time, the ﬂux of silt
increases by three orders of magnitude relative to sand as suspended sediment concentra-
tions increase over the ﬁner grained sea bed. Where the sea bed comprises a mixture of
grain sizes, ﬁner grain sizes may be eroded and transported away while coarser grain sizes
are being deposited in a winnowed lag.
When the direction of the wind is reversed, so that the surface Ekman layer ﬂows
offshore, there is an onshore ﬂow above the sea bed, producing upwelling. Suspended and
bedload sediment ﬂuxes of ﬁne sand are directed shorewards, with a peak at a water depth
of approximately 20 m. As a result, there is erosion in deeper water depths and deposition in
shallow-intermediate water depths. This illustrates the different sedimentation and erosion
patterns generated by a change in the orientation of the wind stress. Such a change in
orientation may take place between storm events or even within the course of a single
storm. From the perspective of the sediment routing system, erosional and sedimentation
patterns on storm-dominated continental shelves are complex, but it is clear that cross-shelf
ﬂuxes do not allow widespread export of sand-grade sediment beyond the shelf edge to the
deep sea.

Figure 5.19 Cross-shelf suspended sediment ﬂux on a model continental shelf based on the Eastern
Seaboard of the United States. During large storm events, ﬁne sand (0.1 mm) is resuspended and
transported to a water depth of 70 m on the outer shelf, and is deposited in deeper water of the
shelf edge and upper slope. During small storms, very little sand grade sediment is transported, but
signiﬁcant ﬂuxes of medium (0.01 mm) and coarse (0.04 mm) silt are eroded from shallow water
depths of about 25 m and deposited in the mid-shelf region (inset). The deposition/erosion rate is
proportional to the gradient in the cross-shelf sediment ﬂux. Modiﬁed from Cookman and Flemings

A two-dimensional numerical code known as 2D SEDFLUX 1.0C also simulates
sediment movement on the continental shelf, but includes a multi-sized sediment load and
continually evolving boundary conditions (ﬂuvial sediment supply, seaﬂoor bathymetry, sea
level etc.) to build a picture of sedimentary architecture (Syvitski and Hutton, 2001). It is
part of a full interactive model that takes a source-to-sink approach called EARTHWORKS
(Syvitski, Pratson, and Morehead, 1997). Sediment is supplied by a single river and enters
the marine basin as hyperpycnal or hypopycnal (plume) ﬂows. In momentum-driven
plumes, sediment is fractionated by grain size as it drops out of the overlying plume
(Syvitski and Alcott, 1993). The plume may be deﬂected by entering a crossﬂow such as

a coastal current. Although the spreading angle about the centreline position is narrow
(approximately 20◦) for fully turbulent jets, deposited sediment is commonly resuspended
and advected by wave energy, bottom currents and bioturbation. These processes are
lumped together and speciﬁed by a single diffusivity k(t, y), where t is time and y is the
vertical coordinate, which reﬂects the maximum energy of the coastal ocean available to
move sediment. The amount of sediment that is capable of being resuspended is then
∂h
∂t = ∂
∂x

k(t, y)∂h
∂x

(5.34)
where h is the bathymetry. For wave processes, k(t, y) may be assumed to reduce exponen-
tially with water depth. The amount of sediment of each grain size moved on the sea bed is
given by a further diffusivity term ¯k:
∂¯k
∂t = ¯ki
∂h
∂t
(5.35)
where the subscript i denotes the ith grain-size class. In other words, the change in sea bed
elevation (water depth) attributable to the removal of sediment grains of size i is a fraction
of the total change in the water depth by an index hi, which varies from 0 to 1.
In 2D SEDFLUX, sediment may also be moved into deeper water by gravitational
failure. Failure of the sea bed, for example of the delta front, may generate debris ﬂows or
turbidity currents . Turbidity currents may also issue from the river mouth as hyperpycnal
ﬂows. As the turbidity current ﬂows down the sea bed it entrains ambient water, thus
increasing the ﬂow volume. Sediment may be lost from the ﬂow by deposition or gained
by erosion of the sea bed. The balance between these two processes gives the change of
the ﬂux of the ith grain-size class of the suspended load in the transport direction. The
concentrations and ﬂuxes across the shelf of suspended sediment of mixed grain size has
also been modelled by Zhang et al. (1999) and Harris and Wiberg (2001).
The 35 km-wide Valencia Shelf is situated south of Barcelona in the western Mediter-
ranean and experiences a north-to-south ﬂowing coastal current (Figure 5.20). It also has
a storm-dominated nearshore-inner shelf belt of winnowed terrigenous sand and gravel,
extending to 20 m water depth, beyond which calcareous mud is accumulating (Maldonado,
1972). Rates of accumulation based on 210Pb dating of piston core sediment are 2.6 mm y−1
near the Ebro delta, north of the Valencia Shelf, reducing to half this rate on the southern
portion of the Valencia Shelf (Maldonado et al., 1983). A circulation model of water
movement on the shelf in response to northeasterly storms shows a three-layer geostrophic
ﬂow: a surface drift caused by the Coriolis deﬂection of a wind-driven current towards
the shore; a pressure gradient current caused by the coastal set-up (less than 1 m), which
is turned geostrophically to ﬂow along the shelf to the southwest; and a bottom ﬂow
retarded by friction on the sea bed, ﬂowing obliquely offfshore to the southeast. Sediment is
therefore advected along-shore to the southwest, with a bottom ﬂow drifting mud obliquely
offshore into an inner shelf mud belt. The source of the mud is probably a combination of
the Ebro River, shoreface erosion of muddy alluvial fans during sea level rise, and small
contributions from local streams.

Cross-shelf transport can also be affected by tidal action, but the extent of seaward ﬂux
rather than balanced reversing ﬂow is not clear. The seaward ﬁning of grain size under
tidal ﬂows, as occurs in the Celtic Sea, suggests the fractionating effect of net transport.
The interaction of storm ﬂows with tidal sand ridge topography may cause across-shelf
transport, as on the sandy shelves of eastern Canada (Amos and Judge, 1991).
5.7 Interaction between Ocean Currents and Coastal Waters
Ocean currents intrude onto the continental shelf in less than 3% of the world’s oceans.
Where they do, they exert a strong inﬂuence on sediment transport and therefore participate
.006
15:07:16

5.7 Interaction between Ocean Currents and Coastal Waters

in the marine part of the sediment routing system. There are a number of ways in which
ocean currents interact with coastal waters:
• It is common for a shallow water countercurrent to the offshore deep ocean current
to form. An example is the western Atlantic Ocean north of Cape Hatteras, where a
nearshore coastal current ﬂows to the southwest in the opposite direction to the Gulf
Stream.
• Upwelling along the eastern sides of continents, such as the Peru Current in the south
Paciﬁc Ocean and the Benguela Current in the south Atlantic Ocean. Upwelling is a result
of the interaction of a wind drift current and a geostrophic ﬂow, and brings cold, deep,
nutrient-rich water to the surface, thereby strongly inﬂuencing biological productivity
and the cycling of carbon.
• Oceanic waters can be driven by strong transient currents during cyclones, moving
roughly parallel to the coast.
• Ocean currents may intrude onto continental shelves. The Agulhas Current off the south-
east African coast is the best example, which is able to intrude because of the narrowness
and steepness of the shelf. Bottom currents that exceed 0.2 m s−1 for more than 50%
of time (Cronin et al., 2013) are found beneath the core of the ocean current at approx-
imately the shelf-edge and cause signiﬁcant transport of carbonate sand and reworked
gravels (Figure 5.21).

The continental shelf along the southeast African continental margin is very narrow
(3–40 km) and the adjacent continental slope is very steep (maximum values of greater
than 12◦), which allows the intrusion onto the shelf of the powerful Agulhas Current.
The nearshore sand prism is dominated by the wind-generated swell wave regime. Some
sediment escapes the nearshore zone and is fed into a sand stream on the central shelf

driven southwestwards by the Agulhas Current (Flemming, 1981; Green, 2009). At points
along the ﬂow path, structural offsets guide sediment dispersal oceanwards, causing
suspended sediment to spill over the shelf-slope break. Clockwise gyres are developed in
the lee of the structural offsets, producing countercurrents transporting sand northeastwards
(Figure 5.22).
The southeast African continental margin is incised by regularly spaced submarine
canyons. Where canyon heads are far from shore because of the existence of a relatively
wide shelf, as off Durban, their effect on sediment dispersal is minimal. However, else-
where the shelf is very narrow, as north of Cape St Lucia, and canyons intersect sediment
pathways. The continental shelf between Port Elizabeth and the mouth of the Limpopo
River north of Maputo is divided into four compartments (Flemming, 1981). The presence
of bedload partings and countercurrent eddies restricts the mixing of sediment between
compartments.
The sediment routing system is fed by sediment originating from a number of sources
(Figure 5.22). The predominant source is river supply to the coast. About 75% of riverine
sediment supplied to the shelf comes from the 5 largest rivers. In addition, local minor
contributions are made by modern and relict biogenic products, erosion of the coast and
shallow marine seabed and authigenesis at the sea bed.
The total sediment input from 18 catchments entering the coastal ocean is estimated at
95 × 106 m3 yr−1 (Flemming, 1981). Bedload is estimated to be about 5% of the total
sediment load of rivers, and the biogenic production is thought to be about 15% of the
bedload ﬁgure. These total sediment supply rates exceed the volume preserved on the shelf,
requiring some sediment to be expelled from the shelf segment into the deep sea.

The Deep Marine Segment
The deep marine segment, comprising the continental slope and deep basin ﬂoor, is the
ﬁnal destination in the sediment cascade from source to sink. High volumes of sediment
are deposited in the deep sea, as demonstrated by the surface areas of large submarine fans
such as the Indus Fan (1,100,000 km2) and the Bengal Fan (3,000 km long and 1,000 km
wide). The Bengal Fan has a maximum sediment thickness of 16.5 km (Curray, Emmel,
and Moore, 2002). Of the sediment volume released from the combined catchments of the
Ganges–Brahmaputra river systems, about 25% is delivered to the Bengal Fan (Goodbred
and Kuehl, 1999). The fraction of the sediment supply delivered to the deep sea varies
from one sediment routing system to another (Table 6.1). Negligible sediment in the Ama-
zon system currently reaches the deep sea, whereas 75% of the sediment supply of the
Congo/Zaire system reaches the deep basin ﬂoor at the present day.
The morphology of the continental slope is strongly inﬂuenced by the sediment supply
of associated rivers (O’Grady et al., 2000), so slope length shows a positive correlation with
river length (Sømme et al., 2009). Small, tectonically active systems generally have steep
slopes compared to large systems nourished with high sediment supply rates, which have
lower gradients and pass transitionally into the basin ﬂoor. Slope length Ls, therefore, can be
used as a proxy for the longest associated river catchment Lr in studies of ancient sediment
routing systems, using Ls = 1.08L0.54
r
(Sømme et al., 2009). Delivery of sediment to the
shelf edge to build the continental slope depends on the across-shelf sediment transport rate.
The remaining sediment is transported to the basin ﬂoor through submarine canyons. The
sediment discharges across the shelf and down submarine canyons, however, may be highly
variable over time (Covault and Graham, 2010). Sediment storage on the shelf must also
vary over time in a reciprocal fashion. The potential for shelf storage depends on shelf area
and on the presence of waves, tides and geostrophic ﬂows capable of widely distributing
the mud, silt and sand delivered to the coast by rivers (Chapter 5).
6.1 Slope Morphology
The residence of sediment in slope accommodation represents a signiﬁcant storage in the
global budget. Sediment ﬁlls accommodation on the continental slope in a number of dif-
ferent settings. The accommodation on the continental slope is governed by the topography

of the depositional surface and its graded (steady-state) proﬁle, the graded proﬁle being an
idealised proﬁle representing the long-term equilibrium between deposition and erosion.
Accommodation may be categorised as ponded, healed slope, incised submarine valley and
slope accommodation (Figure 6.1).
Ponded accommodation is found in three-dimensionally closed topographic lows form-
ing intra-slope basins. Ponded accommodation is generated by localised withdrawal of
mobile substrates (typically salt or shale) and less commonly by structural deformation
resulting in footwall synclines in contractional settings and hangingwall basins in exten-
sional settings. Healed-slope accommodation occurs in mid-slope regions and is the space
between a lower, stepped proﬁle and a higher-angle equilibrium proﬁle, tapering both land-
ward and seaward. Accommodation in incised submarine valleys and canyons is generated
by submarine erosion, and is commonly ﬁlled with channel deposits. Slope accommodation
is the space between the highest stable graded-slope proﬁle and the top of healed slope
accommodation. The graded slope angle is dependent on pore pressure within slope muds,
high pore pressure reducing shear strength and promoting mass movement.
Slopes evolve through time depending on the sediment ﬂux from the continental shelf,
but also depending on the mobility of the substrate. Slopes can be classiﬁed topographically
in a continuum on the basis of the attainment of grade (Figure 6.2) (Prather, 2003):

mid- to upper-slope healed-slope accommodation, as in the Gulf of Mexico. These

3. Graded slopes that lack signiﬁcant topography, as in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. They
are associated with low rates of substrate mobility. The dominant sediment transport
processes are bypass and erosion, leading to aggradational turbidite sequences at the
toe of slope and deep marine basin. The resulting fan apron forms a platform for slope
progradation.
Slopes may also be classiﬁed in tems of the grain size of the sediment supply (gravel-
rich, sand-rich, mud/sand-rich, mud-rich) and the conﬁguration of the feeder system (point-
sourced, line-sourced and multiple-sourced) (Reading and Richards, 1994). However, slope
and basin ﬂoor systems may change radically in their character over time, in response to
changing sea level, source area climate and tectonics. This makes any static classiﬁcation
system vulnerable.
The storage of sediment on the continental slope, as a fraction of the delivery to the
coastal ocean by rivers, depends on the availability of slope accommodation combined
with the existence of a sediment transport system. For example, the Waipaoa River delivers
15 Mt yr−1 of sediment to the coastal ocean along the active margin of eastern New
Zealand. The slope traps 15−18% of the riverine discharge at the present day. Although
some of the sediment accumulating on the proximal slope is derived from turbidity cur-
rents, the bulk of it appears to be due to hemipelagic deposition (Alexander et al., 2006).
In contrast, the Gulf of Mexico is situated on an extensional margin and has been sup-
plied with sediment throughout the Cenozoic. Sediment supply to the ocean has over the
long term exceeded the available accommodation of the coastal plain and shelf created
by tectonic subsidence, compaction and sediment loading, so more than two-thirds of the
deposited sediment volume occurs beyond the contemporary shelf edge on the continental
.007

slope and abyssal plain (Galloway, Ganey-Curry, and Whiteaker, 2009). Sediment supply
was by a suite of large rivers whose loads were affected by tectonic uplift and climate
changes in the source areas during the Cenozoic (Galloway, 2005). Each progradational
cycle caused coastal plain deposits to accumulate over an apron of continental slope sed-
iments, which accumulated by the ﬁlling of accommodation generated by extension and
salt withdrawal superimosed on broader background patterns of compaction and ﬂexural
subsidence.
6.2 Sediment Transfer to the Deep Sea: Critical Role of Submarine Canyons
Submarine canyons are incisions into continental margins (Shepard and Dill, 1966) that act
as conduits of sediment en route to the deep sea (Table 6.1) and play an important role in
the exchange between oceanic and shelf water masses. Sediment transport in submarine
canyons may be triggered by a number of physical processes (Puig, Palanques, and Martín,
2014):
1. Initiation of turbidity currents by the surface waves of storms. Current meters deployed
close to the sea bed have recorded ﬂow speeds during storm events of greater than
0.5 m s−1 in submarine canyons such as Scripps and La Jolla off the Californian coast.
Considerably higher speeds lasting several hours were recorded in nearby Monterey
Canyon using acoustic laser doppler proﬁlers (Xu, Noble, and Rosenfeld, 2004). All
these high velocity ﬂows are thought to have been turbidity currents, captured by
canyons whose heads were incised across the shelf to within a short distance of the coast.
Sediments delivered by along-shelf currents and river outﬂows are deposited temporar-
ily near the canyon head before being ﬂushed oceanwards during storms. Canyons that
incise to positions farther from the coastline at mid-shelf to shelf-break depths can also
funnel ﬁne grained sediment stirred up by high wave orbital velocities during storms.
2. Advection of resuspended sediment from adjacent shelves. Increased sediment ﬂuxes
through submarine canyons has been attributed to resusupension of shelf sediment
during storms as nepheloid layers. The advection of these layers of resuspended
sediment is favoured by the presence of cold, dense waters over the shelf, as in Cap de
Creus Canyon, Gulf of Lions, France (Palanques et al., 2008) (Figure 5.14). Cascading
of dense shelf waters is caused by cooling, evaporation or freezing and may reach
speeds in excess of 0.8 m s−1 in the Cap de Creus Canyon. Similar processes operate in
the northern Adriatic shelf, where dense water cascades into the Bari Canyon.
3. Negatively buoyant plumes from river discharges. Offshore moving turbidity currents
are well known to be associated with large river discharges. They move due to the
excess density of suspended sediment in a sea bed-hugging plume, but some may be
triggered by the failure of oversteepened, recently deposited sediment near the canyon
head. Var Canyon (off Nice, France) carries turbidity ﬂows of this type during times
of approximately yearly ﬂoods of the Var River (Mulder et al., 1998). However, larger
turbidity currents are generated with decadal frequency and by slope failures.
.007
15:07:07

6.2 Sediment Transfer to the Deep Sea: Critical Role of Submarine Canyons
175
4. Large slope failures evolving into turbidity currents. Large submarine slope failures
generate debris ﬂows and very fast turbidity currents with long run-out distances. The
Grand Banks event of 1929, which was triggered by an earthquake, is best known
(Heezen and Ewing, 1952). The volume of sediment deposited in the Sohm abyssal plain
(greater than 150 km3) suggests that much of the sediment was mobilised from the upper
canyon rather than representing continental slope sources (Hughes Clark et al., 1990).
5. Internal waves oscillating along canyon axes. Oscillating ﬂows with a semi-diurnal or
diurnal frequency may reach speeds of 0.3 m s−1, high enough to transport sand-grade
sediment (Shepard, Marshall, and McLoughlin, 1974).
The abundance of data documenting the vigorous transport of sediment and water down
submarine canyons at the present day demonstrates that sediment is exported to the deep
sea during conditions of sea level highstand. Sediment transport down submarine canyons
depends on both the tapping of a sediment pathway such as a river outlet or a littoral drift
and the oceanographic (and to some extent atmospheric) conditions that drive sediment
transport and resuspension on the continental shelf. Submarine canyons therefore play a
vital role in transporting sediment to the absorbing state of the deep sea, but they also serve
as sediment storage areas. Sediment advected down a canyon may settle onto the sea bed
and remain there for hours to years, centuries and millennia before renewed transport by
infrequent, large ﬂows triggered by seismically generated slope failures or exceptional river
ﬂoods.
Submarine canyons may be incised into bedrock or into unconsolidated or partially con-
solidated marine sediments deposited during previous cycles of shoreface and shelf progra-
dation and retrogradation. Canyons incised into mechanically weak sediments, which is
typical of large passive margins, can form relatively rapidly (103 −105 yr), allowing
basin ﬂoor fan systems to change position. Active margins, in contrast, are commonly
associated with bedrock canyons that form over protracted periods of time and are less
mobile.
Larger shelf-slope systems where the shelf is greater than 50 km in width, as is typical
of passive margins, generally have canyon heads located more than 10 km from the
river mouth in relatively deep water (∼100 m), as in the case of the Amazon, Cap
Ferret and Danube systems. Smaller systems typically associated with active margins
have canyon heads located less than 10 km from the river mouth in relatively shallow
water (∼50 m), as is the case in the Tyrrhenian Sea, Delgado and Golo examples
(Sømme et al., 2009).
The heads of submarine canyons must intercept coastal and shelf sediment-transporting
currents in order to funnel large quantities of sediment into the deep sea (Figure 6.3). It is
estimated that 200 to 250 × 103 m3 yr−1 of sand enters the upper part of Monterey Canyon
from the Santa Cruz littoral cell in the northern half of the bay (Best and Griggs, 1991) and
a similar amount may enter the canyon by littoral transport from the southern half. Sand
accumulates continuously in the upper part of the canyon and is advected episodically to
the deep sea fan (Paull et al., 2005).

6.3 Basin Plains and Deep Sea Fans
Deep sea fans comprise some of the greatest accumulations of sediment on Earth. There
is a relationship between fan area or fan length and long-term volumetric deposition rate
(Wetzel, 1993) (Figure 6.4), with presently active fans, modern fans and fossil fans all plot-
ting along the same powerlaw regression. Sømme et al. (2009) expressed this relationship as
S = 0.0055L1.354

(6.1)
where S is a sediment deposition rate by mass (×106 Mt yr−1) and Lf is fan length in km.

(×106 Mt yr−1), fans with deltaic sources have smaller lengths than those with estuarine
sources for the same riverine suspended sediment discharge (Figure 6.4b).
The area of basin-ﬂoor fans scales closely on the catchment area of the river basin
feeding the fan with sediment:
Af = 176.3A0.786
c
(6.2)
where Af is fan area ×103 km2 and Ac is catchment area ×106 km2 (Sømme et al., 2009).
Equation (6.2) can be compared with equation (4.16) to show the difference between the
geometry of terrestrial and submarine fans. Note that the submarine regression is for Ac in
106 km2 and fan area is in 103 km2, whereas the scales for terrestrial mountain front fans
are both km2.
Small fans at active margins are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller in fan
area than fans at passive margins, and about three orders of magnitude smaller in their
associated catchment areas. Large fans at passive margins, linked to major river systems
draining to the stretched plate margin, therefore dominate the sequestering of sediment in
the deep ocean from a global perspective.
Most deepsea fans are located at the base of the continental slope and may extend
onto the basin ﬂoor for thousands of kilometers. The water depth above the distal part of
submarine fans ranges from hundreds of metres to more than 6,000 m. The distal parts of
small fans at active margins are in signiﬁcantly shallower water depths (centred on 1 km)
than fans at passive margins and large fans at active margins, suggesting that small fans
occupy basin compartments perched on the continental slope or fault-bounded troughs in
the continental shelf. Sediment may be routed through intra-slope basins at active margins
and bypass the fan on its journey to locations deeper on the continental slope. The distal
parts of large active margin deepsea fans and those at passive margins are in water depths
of several thousand metres, typical of the ocean-continent crustal transition.
Early models of stratigraphy at continental margins made a strong connection between
submarine fan deposition and periods of sea level fall and lowstand (Chapter 10). The argu-
ment was that during sea level fall the continental shelf is subaerially exposed and incised
by canyons, so that the sediment supply from the land surface bypassed the continental
shelf and was routed directly to the deep sea (Vail, Mitchum, and Thompson, 1977). If this
were so, it would imply that there is negligible sediment transport to the deep sea at the
present day highstand of sea level. Yet, turbidite deposition has continued in the deep sea
during the Holocene transgression in, for example, the Mississippi, Amazon and Bengal
fans as well as the California Borderland. Subsequently, a compilation of data from 22
deep sea fans has enabled fan deposition rate to be related to sea level since 35 ka – a
time period over which sea level change is well calibrated (Lambeck and Chappell, 2001).
From this analysis, it is clear that deposition on deep sea fans can take place at any stage
of sea level (Covault and Graham, 2010) (Figure 6.5), particularly if submarine canyons
incise the continental shelf to intersect littoral sediment pathways. It has been argued that
at highstands, deltas may prograde to the edges of continental shelves and deliver sediment
to the deep sea when riverine sediment supply is sufﬁcient (Burgess and Hovius, 1998).

no gain or loss from sources or sinks on the continental shelf. Inset shows a log-log plot of Vs versus
Qf for different values of the exponent Tmin/C in equation (6.4).
The minimum time required for the transit of a delta to the shelf edge Tmin, assuming
that there is no storage elsewhere on the shelf, is simply
Tmin = C
 Vs
Qf

(6.3)
where Vs is the shelf volume, Qf is the volumetric ﬂux of ﬂuvial sediment, and C is a dimen-
sionless constant that incorporates the effects of sediment loading, thermal subsidence and
compaction. Equation (6.3) can be rearranged to give
logQf = logV(Tmin/C)
s
(6.4)
so that Tmin/C is the slope of a log-log plot of Qf versus Vs. C is likely to vary from margin
to margin, but was assumed to be a constant ∼1.4 for the 24 deltas studied by Burgess and
Hovius (1998). Consequently, Tmin ranges from less than 10 kyr to greater than 100 kyr
in Figure 6.6. These estimates of progradation time to reach the shelf edge are, however,
potentially strongly affected by loss of sediment in shelf storage. Much sediment from
the Amazon delta, for example, is transported along-shelf by wind-driven ocean currents,
thereby reducing shore-normal rates of progradation (Nittrouer et al., 1986). The actual
delta progradation time is therefore better expressed as
T = C

where Qm is the marine ﬂux of sediment on the shelf. For 16 of the 24 examples given
in Burgess and Hovius (1998), the estimated marine ﬂux is greater than the riverine input,
indicating that sediment on the shelf is gained from sources other than adjacent rivers. Of
the remaining 8 deltas, the actual progradation times vary between 112 and 582 kyr. These

progradation times are rapid enough to ensure progradation to the shelf edge during high-
stands of sea level cycles with periodicity 1 Myr, but inadequate to allow progradation to
the shelf-edge at the 100 kyr periodicity of the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene.
A question that needs addressing is whether delivery of sediment to the deep sea from
highstand deltas includes signiﬁcant fractions of sand. The present-day sand fraction of
rivers ranges widely from 98% for the Copper River to 2% for the Mississippi, Indus and
Zaire rivers (Table 6.2). If these present-day values can be extrapolated to times when the
shelf-edge delta directly feeds the deep sea, there would be signiﬁcant sand delivery at

highstands. If this sand were evenly spread over the whole fan surface, the deposition rate
would vary from ∼0.002−0.013 mm yr−1 for the sand-poor cases such as the Indus and
Mississippi respectively, to ∼0.18−0.28 mm yr−1 for the more sand-rich Nile and Amazon
examples, respectively (Table 6.2).
A fall in sea level towards a glacio-eustatic lowstand would cause the merging of rivers
on the subaerially exposed continental shelf (Mulder and Syvitski, 1996) (Section 10.2.1),
as seen on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 10.9). As an example,
if sea level fell by 200 m, all of the rivers currently discharging into the Adriatic Sea
would become tributaries of the Po River. The merging into larger river systems with lower
gradients would cause a drop in sediment concentration and the reduction in hyperpycnal
outﬂows, despite the global increase in sediment delivery to the ocean. Consequently, the
delivery of sand at times of lowstand may not be signiﬁcantly greater than during highstand,
but the spatial distribution of sand may differ markedly. Whereas at lowstands a small
number of megarivers would deposit sand-rich sediments at widely spaced canyon mouths,
at highstands, deltas that have prograded close to the shelf edge in the absence of submarine
canyons would represent more of a line source of sediment.
Canyons incised into continental shelves to very shallow water depths maintain con-
nections between the erosional source area and deep-sea depositional systems, so that the
sediment routing system is sustained. This situation is particularly found along tectonically
active continental margins where fault systems create a narrow shelf and constrain the

location of submarine canyons, as in the California Borderland. Sediment deposition during
transgression and highstand is most likely due to the increased contribution of littoral cells
at times when river systems are unable to reach canyon heads across drowned shelves.
Canyon heads that are detached from terrestrial sediment sources are mostly active
during times of sea level lowstand and transgression, when river systems are able to cross
the subaerially exposed shelf and deliver sediment to canyon heads. Increased sediment
deposition on deep sea fans may also take place during transgression due to the connection
between mountain belt uplift, the onset of monsoon rains and the delivery of large sediment
supplies to deep sea fans even during transgression, as in the Himalayan-Bengal-Indus
systems (Clift et al., 2008a). At the present-day, the Bengal Fan is supplied with 412 km3
Myr−1 from the river catchments of the Eastern Ghats, 520 km3 Myr−1 from the Ganges,
540 km3 Myr−1 from the Brahmaputra and 193 km3 Myr−1 from the Salween, making a
total sediment delivery to the deep-water Bengal Fan west of Ninety East Ridge of 1,686
km3 Myr−1. The Irrawaddy supplies 533 km3 Myr−1 to the Andaman sea bed east of the
Ninety East Ridge.
Whereas many turbidites are fed from river discharges into the coastal ocean, continental
margins are also the site of debris ﬂow and gravity slide processes, where the source is the
shelf edge and continental slope. A similar situation is found on the slopes of volcanic
islands and seamounts in the ocean. Gravity-driven slides potentially transport enormous
volumes of sediment to the deep sea (Figure 6.7). Peter Talling and co-workers state in
Talling et al. (2014) (p.33):

Figure 6.8 Deep-water sediment routing systems offshore NW Africa, showing the transport paths
of turbidity currents and giant debris ﬂows. The Canaries debris ﬂow originated by the loading of
the sea bed by a rock avalanche caused by catastrophic collapse of a nearby volcanic seamount. The
Saharan debris ﬂow was due to failure of the continental margin. After Weaver et al. (1992) (ﬁgs.1,
15) with permission of Elsevier and Wynn et al. (2002) (ﬁg.1) with permission of John Wiley &
Sons Inc.
Submarine landslides on open continental slopes can be exceptionally large, with volumes that far
exceed those of any terrestrial landslide. For instance, the Storegga landslide that occurred 8,200
years ago offshore Norway covers an area of sea ﬂoor that is larger than Scotland, and it contains over
3,000 km3 of sediment. This volume is more than 300 times the annual sediment ﬂux transported to
the ocean by all of the world’s rivers.
Gravity ﬂows are important agents in transporting sediment to the basin ﬂoors of the
world’s oceans. The sea bed off northwest Africa is a good example of the prevalence
of mass ﬂows (Weaver et al., 1992; Gee et al., 1999; Talling et al., 2007) (Figure 6.8).
Catastrophic collapse of volcanic islands in the Canaries has repeatedly produced debris
avalanches that load the adjacent sea bed and trigger large debris ﬂows. Some of these
debris ﬂows have yielded turbidity currents that travelled downslope to the Madeira abyssal
plain at water depths in excess of 5 km. Other ﬂows originate from the Agadir Canyon and
are routed for thousands of kilometres to the deep ocean (Wynn et al., 2002). Turbidites en

route to the deep sea commonly interact with sea bed topography caused by sedimentation,
gravitational tectonics and salt movement. Turbidite channels may be deﬂected or guided
by active sea bed topography.
6.4 Deep-Water Circulation
By far the greatest ﬂuxes of water in the deep sea are caused by the thermohaline cir-
culation. The global circulation pattern is vital for the distribution of heat on the Earth’s
surface, but is also responsible for the transport of ﬁne particulate matter. In general, the
deep ocean circulation is sluggish (less than 20 mm yr−1), but the capability of the deep
thermohaline circulation in transporting sediment is inﬂuenced by a number of processes:
(1) currents are intensiﬁed on the western sides of ocean basins (western intensiﬁcation),
(2) current speeds are increased as they ﬂow through bathymetric constrictions and reduce
where they expand, (3) large-scale eddies may develop at the edges of deep geostrophic
ﬂows, resulting in enhanced mixing and a reduced ability to hold sediment in suspension.
The more vigorous bottom currents are able to maintain concentrations of 0.01–0.5 mg l−1
of very ﬁne-grained particulate matter (about 12 μm mean size) in nepheloid layers that
advect material beyond the shelf edge into the deep ocean, where it eventually rains out
onto the sea bed.
The density forcing of currents in the deep sea is maintained by cooling, evaporation
or a combination of both, in which case they are said to be thermohaline. These density
currents of cold or salty water enter the larger ocean through a narrow or shallow strait
and veer to the right (in the northern hemisphere) or left (in the southern hemisphere) by
the Earth’s rotation. Once in the unconﬁned ocean, the speed of the large scale current is
determined by the slope of the ocean bed and the density difference between the current
and the ambient overlying sea water. The speed can reach much higher values, for example
where it encounters topographic features such as submarine canyons or seamounts, or in
western boundary currents. Faster currents carry higher sediment loads, which potentially
accrete in sediment drifts upon deceleration.
Bottom currents deposit large sediment drifts, particularly at the edges of deep bottom
water pathways. The sediment contained in them cannot be linked easily with a cascade
from source to sink. Sediment drifts occur where secondary gyres are shed from the main
current, or where the bottom current runs along the contours of the continental slope.
Fine-grained beds within deep water sediment drifts are consequently commonly known as
contourites (McCave and Tucholke, 1986). Contourites are deﬁned as ‘sediments deposited
or substantially reworked by the persistent action of bottom currents’ (Rebesco et al.,
2014). Contourite drifts typically have a mounded character, generally elongated parallel
or slightly oblique to the strike of the deep-water basin margin, with an adjacent concave
moat. Contourite drifts can be more than 100 km wide, several hundreds of kilometres
long and up to 2 km thick, with a submarine relief of up to 1.5 km. Small patch drifts
are roughly equivalent to individual turbidite lobes (∼100 km2), and giant elongated drifts
.007

6.5 Record of Glaciation in the Deep Sea

match roughly the size of the largest deep sea fans (greater than 108 km2). The largest
contourite drifts are found on the western side of the ocean basins and around the Antarctic
and Arctic Oceans.
The sand, silt and mud of contourite drift deposits is therefore an important absorbing
state in the ocean, representing a storage zone of global signiﬁcance. Bearing in mind the
difﬁculty of sampling modern contourite drifts, and the nascent state of research on fossil
contourite depositional systems, it is not surprising that little is known of the provenance of
their sediment at present. Neglecting the reworking of previously deposited ocean sediment,
the bulk of the sediment comprising contourite depositional systems presumably originates
in the suspended and wash loads of river outﬂows that become incorporated in the oceanic
circulation.
Although contourites were intially discovered in the North and South Atlantic Oceans,
they have since been found in every major ocean basin and even in lakes. One hundred and
sixteen major contourite areas were known at the time of writing the review by Rebesco
et al. (2014), associated with a wide range of oceanographic processes and the circulation of
surface, intermediate and deep water masses. The deﬁnition of the word term ‘contourite’
has therefore broadened from an association with thermohaline currents to include a variety
of other forms of ocean circulation. Contourites are distinct from turbidites deposited
by downslope density currents, and pelagites, deposited by vertical settling, but may be
interstratiﬁed with them.
The large wind-driven and thermohaline circuation of the oceans also affects the slow
settling of primarily biogenic and organic debris of calcareous and silicious plankton living
within the photic zone of the ocean. These pelagic sediments may be contaminated with
other ﬁne sediment derived from volcanic and wind-blown dust and a ﬁne rain of particles
from the cosmos. Although these contaminants may be important sources of nutrients,
affect sea surface temperature and are a signiﬁcant component of sea bed sediment, particu-
larly where winds blow sand, silt and dust from the world’s deserts such as the Sahara (Foltz
and McPhaden, 2008; Evan et al., 2011), they are not major contributors to the budgets of
sediment routing systems.
6.5 Record of Glaciation in the Deep Sea
On orbital (Milankovitch) timescales (104−105 yr), the growth and decay of ice can be
recognised globally (Patterson et al., 2014). But at higher frequencies, the terrestrial and
marine records contain a range of local and regional inﬂuences, including those relating
to ice dynamics (e.g. polar versus temperate systems), drainage basin topography and
size, climate change, sea level, tectonics (active versus passive continental margins) and
oceanographic setting (Jaeger and Koppes, 2015). These inﬂuences are potentially forcings
that may be decipherable in terms of the transmission of sediment ﬂux signals through the
sediment routing system. For example, a climatic forcing may cause a glacial system to
increase bed erosion and consequently result in the transmission of a spike in sediment
ﬂux from the glaciated catchment to the transfer zone of fjords, the continental shelf and
.007

The Deep Marine Segment
continental slope, and to eventual deposition in the deep ocean. This spike in sediment
ﬂux is most likely reduced in amplitude and lagged in time compared to the initial signal
as it is propagated through the sediment routing system (Romans et al., 2015). Glaciated
systems therefore behave like non-glaciated sediment routing systems, albeit with different
dynamical forcings.
Glacial conditions have changed periodically over the Quaternary era, modifying land-
scapes in mid- to high latitudes and producing sedimentary signals that may be global
in extent. Intensiﬁcation of glaciation beginning 2–4 Myr ago is held responsible for the
deposition of thick (up to 5 km) clastic wedges at continental margins. Moving ice, the
primary agent of erosion and deposition in glaciated sediment routing systems, can occur
throughout almost the entire system, from high mountains to the continental shelf edge.
The most complete depositional record of glaciation is found in the deep sea, where the
glacial signal is convolved with oceanographic effects and tectonic processes.
The sediments liberated by glacial erosion are dispersed into other segments of the
sediment routing system en route to the absorbing state of the deep sea, but in contrast
to ﬂuvial systems, glaciers come and go, so may disappear from the landscape while
glacigenic sediment is still being dispersed. The processes of sediment dispersal are varied,
including transport on, within and at the base of moving ice, and more importantly within
a subglacial hydrological system. Subglacial transport is greatly aided by large volumes of
meltwater, so is relatively important in temperate glacial systems. As in ﬂuvial systems,
ice (and water) may be stored, thereby changing the discharge to down-system locations in
ice-proximal regions.
The sediment evacuated from glaciers undergoes a number of transport processes in
glacilacustrine and marine settings. Most sediment enters temperate fjords as meltwater
discharge and direct melting from the calving ice front is less important. Sediment accumu-
lation rates may therefore be extremely high near the grounding line of temperate glaciers.
Rates then decay exponentially with distance from the ice front, due to the settling of
suspended sediment (Syvitski, 1989). For hyperpycnal ﬂows to take place, sediment con-
centrations in the freshwater outﬂow must exceed the density of fjord seawater, requiring
concentrations of at least 30 mg l−1. At smaller concentrations, sediment moves in a surface
plume, whereas at higher values, sediment moves along the sea bed as a gravity-driven
ﬂow.
In contrast, sediment transfer to polar fjords is primarily by calving and ice rafting, most
of the sediment accumulating close to the ice front. Variations in the ﬂux of ice-rafted debris
(IRD) depends on variations in the amount of sediment entrained in the ice, changes in the
ice ﬂux at the terminus, the time spent in the zone of iceberg transit and the melting rate, as
well as interaction with ocean currents (Andrews, 2000).
Continental shelves are dominated by ice streams ﬂowing from the main ice mass.
Deep (100–2,000 m) troughs crossing the shelf link with major sediment depocentres

sediment is transported down the continental slope and into the deep sea by the familiar
processes of debris ﬂows and turbidites and by the settling of ﬁne hemipelagic sediments.
Debris ﬂows are common at the distal ends of ice-stream troughs, forming ‘trough-mouth
fans’ (Cofaigh et al., 2013) (Figure 6.9b).
Cross-margin troughs and associated trough mouth fans are common on high-latitude
continental margins, suggesting that ice streams are the principal means by which sediment
is dispersed in glaciated sediment routing systems. For example, the sediment ﬂux at the
100 km-wide outlet of the Norwegian Channel ice stream reveals a very high sediment
yield of 1.1 Gt yr−1 for the period 20−19 ka during the last glacial stage, equivalent to
8,000 m3 yr−1 per metre width of ice stream front. Such values are similar to the present-
day yields of the largest of modern rivers (Nygård et al., 2007). The sediment ﬂux com-
prises debris ﬂows on the trough mouth fan of the palaeo-ice stream of the Norwegian
Channel, which transported more than 3.2 × 104 km3 of sediment across its grounding line
in a period of 0.5 Myr. The debris ﬂows appear to represent subglacial till that moved
downslope above a low strength layer. The delivery of sediment to the North Atlantic
between 20−19 ka was punctuated, as a result of the Nowegian Channel ice stream switch-
ing on and off. Such switching might have been driven by high-frequency climate cycles
such as the Dansgaard-Oeschger events prominently recorded in Greenland ice cores.
The sediment ﬂux must scale in some way with the ice velocity, with the form
qs = kUs
(6.6)

The Deep Marine Segment
where qs is the sediment ﬂux per unit width (m2 yr−1), Us is the ice stream velocity (m
yr−1) and k is a proportionality coefﬁcient that is conceptually the effective thickness of
mobile debris (m). If qs is 8,000 m3 yr−1, and k ranges between 0.1 and 10 m, the streaming
velocity of the ice varies between 80 and 0.8 km yr−1. The value of the thickness of mobile
debris in the ice stream k is uncertain, but comparisons with other ice streams, the thickness
of transparent units is high-resolution seismic proﬁles and the state of consolidation of
equivalent tills suggest that k is most likely in the range 3−6 m, giving ice velocities of
1.3−2.7 km yr−1.
At the timescale of the period since the LGM, the fast retreat of the termini of modern
tidewater glaciers indicates that the sediment efﬂuxes should be elevated during deglacia-
tion. This trend is found in the sedimentary records of polar and temperate glaciers. Sedi-
ment efﬂuxes are reﬂected in sediment isopachs, which reveal much-increased ﬂuxes during
retreat following the LGM compared to the present day (Hogan, Dowdeswell, and Cofaigh,
2012). In central western Greenland, the sediment ﬂux from meltwater plumes and melting
icebergs coming from the palaeo-Jakobshavn ice sheet while the ice margin was quasi-
stable is estimated to be 1.6 to 3.6 × 107 m3 yr−1. Rapid retreat of ice margins in western
Greenland during deglaciation is characterised by a rapid transition to ice-distal sedimen-
tation of rainout from iceberg-rafted debris and hemipelagic material, accompanied by a
rapid reduction of sediment accumulation rate to about 2 mm yr−1.
At the orbital timescale of Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles (105 yr), sediment
ﬂuxes through the sediment routing system are difﬁcult to assess landward of the continen-
tal shelf break because of reworking by successive ice advances. Beyond the continental
shelf break on the continental slope and in the deep sea, however, gravity-ﬂow deposits and
IRD record the dynamics of ice extent. In Bafﬁn Bay, for example, glacigenic sediment
production was from the northeastern Laurentide, southern Innuitian and western Green-
land ice margins over the last 115 kyr (Simon et al., 2014) (Figure 6.10). These different
sources are marked by different contents of detrital grains and clay minerals.
Knowledge of the provenance of detrital material allows stratigraphic trends in the
sediments of Bafﬁn Bay to be used to assess the sensitivity of the different ice masses
to forcing mechanisms. The northeastern Laurentide and southern Innuitian ice masses,
for example, appear to have been sensitive to high frequency climate ﬂuctuations (such as
Dansgaard-Oeschger events with a recurrence time of a multiple of 1,470 years), whereas
the larger western Greenland margins were more sensitive to large-scale reorganisations of
climate and oceanography. Such reorganisations might have involved changes of relative
sea level or the advection of warmer Atlantic waters into the bay (Simon et al., 2014).
Whereas the conventional view that low sediment ﬂuxes are associated with glacial advance
and high sediment ﬂuxes characterise glacial retreat over a full glacial-interglacial cycle, the
highest sediment accumulation rates were found during the post-LGM transition associated
with elevated input from the relatively small ice streams from the northeastern Laurentian
and southern Innuitian ice sheets, whereas the sediment delivered from the larger and fast-
ﬂowing Uummannaq ice stream on the western Greenland margin dominated the period of
the LGM (32 −16 ka).

Changes in the volume of sediment deposited in the deep sea revealed by isopachs
imaged in high-resolution seismic proﬁles may not directly reﬂect ice dynamics. Although
isopachs may record sediment dispersal in relation to changing ice extent and ice ﬂow,
delivery to the deep sea may be dominated by large-scale submarine mass failures eroding
pre-Quaternary strata, as in the Norwegian and Lofoten deep sea basins (Dowdeswell et al.,
1996). Although pelagic, hemipelagic and glacimarine processes were active during the
LGM, they were responsible for only 10% of the total sediment volume deposited in deep
water.

Sediment Production, Evolution and Provenance
9.1 The Formation of Sediment
There is a complex web of processes affecting the generation of sediment from bedrock
weathering, through transport and intermittent storage, to eventual long-term deposition
in a sedimentary sink. This web of processes imparts a certain textural and compositional
imprint on the ﬁnal deposit, yet joined-up approaches to the pathway from source to sink
are rare (Ibbeken and Schleyer, 1991). Gert Jan Weltje wrote in Weltje (2012) (p.4):
Current approaches to modelling of surface processes treat the coupled evolution of source areas and
sedimentary basins in terms of bulk mass transfer only, and do not take into account compositional
and textural sediment properties.
In such mass balance approaches, the generation of sediment in source regions is commonly
treated as a boundary condition for sediment supply, rather than as a dynamic system in
its own right. Consequently, the properties of weathering products, both texturally and
compositionally, entering the sediment cascade remain poorly constrained. Rare examples
of where a mass balance approach is integrated with a provenance study are taken from
modern and Quaternary environments (for example, Weltje and Brommer (2011)) rather
than from ancient sediment routing systems. The advantage of integrating sediment gen-
eration with Earth surface process models is that the properties of sediment entering the
transport network of sediment routing systems can be predicted and parameterised under
different conditions of climate and tectonics, instead of being simply treated as a volumetric
or solid mass boundary condition.
The evolution of sediment involves important modiﬁcations to the original parent rock
(Johnsson, 1993). Such modiﬁcations might be chemical and mechanical weathering of
bedrock and regolith, or the fractionation of grains during transport. Compositional varia-
tion within a sediment routing system is due to (1) mixing of grains from different sources
and (2) chemical and mechanical weathering of the grain population, which may take
place during regolith formation at source, or during transport and storage en route to a
depositional sink (Weltje, 2012).
Figure 9.1 illustrates a simple mixing model of a fault-bounded sedimentary basin
with two catchments feeding sediment to an adjacent basin. There is a lateral variation in

composition caused by the differences in the lithologies being eroded in the two source
catchments and dispersed into the basin, and a vertical variation caused by progressive
unrooﬁng over time of rocks in the source catchments. Conglomerate clast compositions
can be used to investigate the progressive erosion of lithologically distinct units in the
source catchments (Graham et al., 1986; Steidtmann and Schmitt, 1988; Pivnik, 1990).
Sediment compositions can therefore potentially be used to estimate the proportional
contributions of different sediment sources to rivers or other agents of sediment transport
such as the wind. The proportional contributions can be converted to absolute rates of
sediment ﬂux by using independent estimates of the total sediment discharge, for example,
from measured sediment loads of rivers (Vezzoli et al., 2004; Vezzoli, 2004).
Different source area lithologies have a range of capacities for generating sediment by
weathering and erosion, and different bedrock types have different capacities for breaking
down into particular grain-size ranges. The Sand Generation Index (SGI), for example,
quantiﬁes the relative efﬁciency of sand production from different lithologies (Palomares
and Arribas, 1993; Arribas and Tortosa, 2003). The SGI is a variable that reﬂects the relative
sand-generating capability of a certain bedrock when compared to another bedrock type
that is generating sand-grade sediment under the same topographic and climatic conditions.
The SGI of a given bedrock type A of a dual source A+B, denoted SGIA(A+B), is expressed
in terms of the outcrop area of bedrock type A, denoted SA, needed to produce a sand
composed of equal amounts of both A and B bedrocks:
.010
15:11:10

9.1 The Formation of Sediment
299
SGIA(A+B) = [SA + SB]/SA
(9.1)
where [SA +SB] is the total surface area of the source region (100%), and SA and SB are the
outcrop areas of bedrocks A and B within the source region required to produce sand with
the average modal composition observed. Likewise, the SGI for bedrock type B is
SGIB(A+B) = [SA + SB]/SB
(9.2)
Each rock type has a different potential to generate sand, depending on properties such
as its mineralogy, average crystal size and microfabric (cleavage, fractures) (Palomares
and Arribas, 1993). Studies of metamorphic and granitic terrains show that the SGI of
granitoid rocks is 14–20 times the SGI of slates and schists, and the SGI of gneisses is ﬁve
times that of slates and schists. In sedimentary terrains, siliciclastic sources are the most
productive sedimentary source of sand in the ﬁne, medium and coarse fractions of river
sands analysed by Arribas and Tortosa (2003) from catchments in the Iberian Range, Spain
(Table 9.1) (Figure 9.2). The SGI of siliciclastic sources varies from 20–4, whereas the
SGI of carbonates varies from 1.0–1.3. Siliciclastic sources are therefore 3–20 times more
efﬁcient at producing medium sand-grade sediment than carbonates.
Vezzoli et al. (2004) modiﬁed the original concept of the Sand Generation Index in
order to assess the relative contributions of seven end-member sources of detritus in the
Dora Baltea Basin, Western Alps (Table 9.2). The seven bedrock types are shown in ternary
diagrams of light fraction and heavy fraction (Figure 9.3). The Monte Bianco Massif has
the highest SGI index in the Dora Baltea Basin (SGI of 16.4), followed by the Austroalpine

The total sediment ﬂux of the Dora Baltea Basin is 1 Mt yr−1, comprising 0.59 Mt
yr−1 of bedload and 0.41 Mt yr−1 of suspended load. Analyses of sediment composition
indicate that greater than 75% of the Dora Baltea bedload is derived from tributaries with
sources in the highest granitoid peaks above 4,000 m.a.s.l., though these tributaries drain
only 36% of the total catchment area (Vezzoli, 2004). The Monte Bianco Massif alone
produces 0.294 ± 0.006 Mt of arkosic sands per year, representing 50% of the total bedload
ﬂux of the Dora Baltea Basin. Based on the total sediment ﬂux and drainage basin area, the
sediment yield for the entire Dora Baltea catchment is 306 t km2 yr−1 and the equivalent
denudation rate is 0.12 mm yr−1.
Di Giulio et al. (2003) also analysed the composition of river bed sands in relation to the
surface exposure of sedimentary (and minor metamorphic) lithologies in small catchments
in the northern Apennines. Siliciclastic rocks in source areas are under-represented (diluted)
in river sands compared to their outcropping surface area. Carbonate rocks are also under-
represented. Some rock types, such as metamorphic rocks, occur in quantities of up to
20% of sand samples despite the fact that they are absent in the source area catchments,
indicating that grains are recycled from older siliciclastic rocks (Zuffa, 1987). When the
expected amount of siliciclastic rocks in the drainage area is recalculated to account for
recycling of grains from older coarse-grained siliciclastic rocks, siliciclastic rocks re-plot
as slightly over-represented in river sands, as anticipated from other studies (Arribas and
Tortosa, 2003).
There is therefore a difference between the bulk composition of a parent rock and the
composition of the grain assemblage in regolith or bedload of upland rivers. This difference
increases over time as the sediment is dispersed through the sediment routing system
(Weltje, Meijer, and de Boer, 1998).
The primary controls on the type of sediment released into the sediment cascade are
the mineralogical composition, texture and crystal or particle size of the parent rocks.
.010
15:11:10

302
Sediment Production, Evolution and Provenance
The parent rocks are transformed into sediment by weathering, the extent of which depends
on weathering rate and the residence time of material in the weathering environment.
The rate of silicate weathering is fundamentally controlled by climate, speciﬁcally tem-
perature and precipitation (White and Brantley, 1995). Tectonics provides relief, which
controls the residence time for weathering by the onset of creep or mass ﬂow of hillslope
material downslope. The extent of chemical weathering can be monitored through the ratio
of the abundance of quartz (Q) to feldspars (F). Preferential weathering of feldspars by acid
hydrolysis causes an increase in log(Q/F) over time.
Weltje (1994) generalised the cumulative chemical weathering index of Grantham and
Velbel (1988) to obtain a semi-quantitative index of the extent of weathering under different
climatic and physiographic conditions. The distance in compositional space relative to the
composition of parent rocks (w) is the integration of the rate of weathering V over the
amount of time elapsed since weathering began t:
w =
	
Vdt = ¯Vt
(9.3)
where ¯V is the time-averaged weathering rate. The weathering index of Weltje (1994) (Iw)
relates w to present-day climate and physiography of sediment sources:
Iw = CR ≃w
(9.4)
where C is a semi-quantitative indicator of climate (essentially rainfall) and R is a semi-
quantitative indicator of relief. C is used as a proxy for time-averaged weathering rate
and R is assumed to be inversely proportional to residence time in the source area. The
weathering index Iw takes integer values between 0 and 4 in Weltje (1994) and Weltje et al.
(1998), since S and R are both integers (with values of 0, 1 and 2) as shown in Table 9.3.
The weathering rate can also be expressed in the form of an exponential relationship
V = RSI
c1Qiexp(c2/(c3Ta))
Hreg

(9.5)
where RSI is a regolith supply index, with values of 0 −1, where a value of 1 indicates
the availability of unlimited regolith for the ambient erosion rate, Ta is the year-average
catchment temperature in ◦C, Qi is the soil inﬁltration rate in mm yr−1, Hreg is the regolith
thickness in mm, and c1 to c3 are constants (Forzoni et al., 2014).
The extent of weathering of parent rock to produce sediment can be assessed by using the
log ratios of principal framework elements. Examples are log(Q/F) and log(Q/R), where
Q is quartz content, F is feldspar content and R is the rock fragment content of the sand.
Simultaneous use of both logratios discriminates the parentage and weathering history of
a sand. The values of both logratios correlate with Iw because quartz is more resistant to
weathering than feldspar and rock fragments. The general trend of compositional evolution
with increasing values of the weathering index is therefore towards high values of both
log(Q/F) and log(Q/R) (Figure 9.4).

Sediment Production, Evolution and Provenance
Changes in the rate of sediment supply can be detected in shifts in sediment grain size
and composition, both of which are related to weathering history. Since weathering rates
in humid-tropical conditions are fast (∼104 yr timescale) (Johnsson and Meade, 1990),
and similar rates are found in other climatic zones (Nesbit, Fedo, and Young, 1997), high
frequency variations in sediment supply are potentially attributable to changes in the extent
of weathering, driven, for example, by Milankovitch-band climate change (Section 10.2).
Variations in log(SiO2/Al2O3) in Pliocene turbidites in Corfu (Greece) show that the extent
of weathering decreases from the base to the top of each depositional lobe, indicating that
weathering of sands in the subaerial part of the sediment routing system took place prior to
lobe reactivation (Weltje and de Boer, 1993).
A combination of grain size and compositional characteristics in the non-biogenic por-
tion of deep sea sediments makes it potentially possible to infer palaeoclimate in the source
areas for sediment (Weltje and Prins, 2003). The grain-size distribution of a sediment sam-
ple represents a mixture of sediment populations corresponding to the different mechanisms
of sediment production and sediment transport. The grain-size characteristics of a ﬁnite
number of so-called dynamic populations represent a certain set of processes of sediment
production and transport. Each dynamic population can be tied to a speciﬁc source and
dispersal mechanism. The bulk composition or mineralogy of a sample is usually a function
of the grain-size distribution, since each size fraction has a characteristic ﬁngerprint in
terms of composition. Dynamic populations are expected to be markedly different, for
example, in turbidites, where transport and deposition are highly size-selective, and ice-
rafted detritus, where processes of sediment production may dominate over processes of
transport. Examples of palaeoclimate interpretations based on the recognition of dynamic
populations in marine sediment are found in Weltje and Prins (2003).
9.2 Precipitation, Vegetation and Erosion
Climate, expressed in terms of mean annual precipitation, precipitation variability, vege-
tation cover, temperature or other climate-related indices, is a major control on the sup-
ply of sediment to sedimentary basins (Hooke, 2000). Climatic inﬂuences are commonly
expressed in terms of precipitation or effective precipitation, as in the seminal study of
Langbein and Schumm (1958). The effective precipitation is the annual rainfall that would
be required, on average, to produce the observed run-off. The Langbein–Schumm curve
of effective precipitation versus sediment yield shows a maximum in yield at ∼300 mm
yr−1 after which sediment yield decreases with increasing precipitation (Figure 9.5), which
is thought to be due to the binding effect of vegetation at high values of precipitation.
The curve presented by Dendy and Bolton (1976) has a similar shape, but with the yield
maximum at ∼500 mm yr−1, whereas the curve of Douglas (1967) is more complex,
with a peak in yield at ∼450 mm yr−1 but with an increasing trend in yield at high
levels of precipitation (Figure 9.5). Wilson (1973) reported similar results. The difﬁculty in
interpreting the plots of effective precipitation and sediment yield is the possible impact of
other factors such as relief, drainage basin size and bedrock lithology.

Precipitation varies seasonally and on shorter timescales, which contributes to the inten-
sity of precipitation and the erosivity of run-off. Rainfall variability can be modelled using
the relation p2/P, where p is the maximum mean monthly precipitation and P is the mean
annual precipitation (Fournier, 1960). Alternatively, the storm run-off rate Ps can be related
to the mean annual run-off rate ¯P by a ‘total ﬂood duration ratio’ ζ, deﬁned as the total
fraction of a given year that the drainage basin is subject to ﬂooding (Tucker and Slinger-
land, 1997). For example, if rainfall fell continually at a uniform rate throughout the year, ζ
would be equal to 1. If it fell on one day only, ζ would be equal to 1/365. The instantaneous
storm run-off rate is then
Ps =
¯P
ζ
(9.6)
Tucker and Slingerland (1997) varied ¯P, Ps and ζ in model runs using a landscape evo-
lution model. Catchments responded strongly to run-off intensity, as opposed to mean
precipitation, increasing in denudation rate and sediment efﬂux with increasing rainfall
intensity. However, some authors have found no signiﬁcant correlation between rainfall
variability and sediment yield in global data sets (Summerﬁeld and Hulton, 1994; Hovius,
1998). The effects of variability are most likely at their strongest in semi-arid and arid
regimes. Precipitation variability may be more important than mean precipitation in long-
term landscape evolution (Tucker and Bras, 2000), but the effect of short-term rainfall
variability on long-term landscape development is likely to be smaller than the impact of
human activities (Baartman et al., 2013).

Sediment Production, Evolution and Provenance
The distribution of storm (or daily) rainfalls is commonly expressed as an exponential
function, in which the number density of days with rainfall greater than r is estimated as
N(r) = N0exp(−r/r0)
(9.7)
where N0 is the number of days on which rain fell, and r0 is the mean rain per rain day, so
r0N0 is the total annual rainfall R. Erosion of soil and regolith requires overland ﬂow, which
can only be generated above a certain storm size with a run-off threshold, which is a storage
capacity of the soil or regolith h. In a single storm the overland ﬂow per unit area j is:
j = r −h
(9.8)
Summing equation (9.8) over all the rainfall events exceeding the run-off threshold gives
J =
	 ∞
h
(r −h)N(r)dr = N0r0exp(−h/r0)
(9.9)
Assuming sediment yield is proportional to the square of the water discharge, the yield
from a single rainfall event y is
y ∝(r −h)2
(9.10)
which when summed over the frequency distribution gives the total sediment yield Y:
Y ∝
	 ∞
h
(r −h)2N0exp(−r/r0)dr = 2N0r2
0exp(−h/r0)
(9.11)
which is known as the Cumulative Erosion Potential (CEP) (DePloey, Kirkby, and Ahnert,
1991). The CEP combines the effects of rainfall distribution through N0 and r0 and a soil
hydraulic parameter h0 to give a measure of the climatic component in soil erosion. As an
example, if there are 100 rain-days per year (N0), the mean rainfall per rain-day (r0) is 10
mm, the annual rainfall (R) is 1000 mm. Letting the run-off threshold (h0) be 30 mm, the
CEP becomes ∼1,000. If we reduce the number of rain-days to 50, but increase the mean
rainfall per rain-day to 20 mm, which reﬂects a more seasonal regime, CEP doubles to
∼2,000.
The CEP model has been extended to incorporate the effects of the growth of vegetation
and the impact of biomass on soil strength. The CSEP (Cumulative Soil Erosion Potential)
of Kirkby and Cox (1995) gives a global picture that shows highest erosion potential in
monsoonal climates and lowest erosion potential in deserts and cool temperate belts.
Plots of CSEP versus annual rainfall show signiﬁcant differences between non-seasonal
and seasonal patterns of rainfall, and as a function of mean annual temperature (Figure 9.6).
The overall form of the curves is similar to that proposed by Langbein and Schumm (1958),
with maximum erosion rate in semi-arid climates, a minimum in temperate climates and
a renewed rise at very high rainfalls. In seasonal Mediterranean-type climates, rainfall
seasonality has opposite effects at high and low temperatures. At low temperatures, sea-
sonality increases erosion potential, whereas at high temperatures, seasonality reduces
erosion potential. Clearly, there is a limit to the applicability of the full CSEP model to
ancient sediment routing systems where parameters describing the rainfall regime and the

vegetation-organic growth dynamics are unknown. However, the curves in Figure 9.6 are
a starting point for making educated guesses of the likely impact of climate change on
erosion and sediment ﬂux in the geological past, especially where the palaeoclimate can
be well constrained (Van der Zwan, 2002). The CSEP model has been used to understand
variations of sediment production linked to Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles in the
Great Basin, United States (Leeder et al., 1998).
A global scale view can be gained by implementing a soil erosion model developed from
the results of plot-scale (∼1 m2 to 30 m2) erosion experiments and has the form
E = kJ2S1.67exp(−0.07ν)
(9.12)
where E is erosion in mm day−1, k is a soil erodibility constant with values betweeen 0.02
and 0.69, J is the overland ﬂow in mm day−1, S is the slope and ν is the vegetation cover
expressed as a percentage (Zhang, Drake, and Wainwright, 2002). Rates of overland ﬂow
.010
15:11:10

Sediment Production, Evolution and Provenance
can be expressed by a modiﬁcation of the Carson and Kirkby (1972) model, assuming
that daily rainfall amounts approximate an exponential frequency distribution within a time
period and that the real soil water storage capacity is affected by the initial soil moisture:
Ji = Piexp(−(rc −QTi)/(Pi/Ni))
(9.13)
where Ji is the overland ﬂow (run-off) in the given time period (mm), Ni is the number
of rain-days in the given time period, QTi is the total initial soil moisture (mm), rc is the
potential water storage capacity (mm) equal to 300 mm, representing a rooting zone, and
i is the ith time period from 1 to 12 for monthly intervals (Zhang et al., 2002). If k = 0.4,
S = 0.05, ν = 0.6 and J = 730 mm yr−1, the calculated erosion rate E is 0.06 mm yr−1.
A soil erosion model of the form in equation (9.12) has been used at timescales appro-
priate for long-term landscape dynamics, where the erosion rate E is termed the maximum
achievable erosion rate, applying to the case of unlimited regolith availability (Forzoni
et al., 2014). Regolith production rates may be signiﬁcantly lower than the potential erosion
rate (Tucker and Slingerland, 1997). Forzoni et al. (2014) therefore introduced a regolith
supply index RSI with values of 0 to 1 in order to simulate both detachment-limited and
transport-limited conditions.
Regolith production rates can be approximated by the rate of conversion of bedrock to
regolith by physical and chemical weathering. This conversion rate is commonly taken as
inversely proportional to the thickness of regolith cover C (Tucker and Slingerland, 1997):
ω = kwexp(−C/C∗)
(9.14)
where ω is the vertical rate of descent of a weathering front, kw is the weathering descent
rate for bare bedrock (that is, at C = 0), and C∗describes the rate at which the weathering
rate decays with increasing regolith thickness. The bare bedrock regolith production rate
kw and the weathering decay constant C∗were given values of 0.0005 m yr−1 and 0.5 m
respectively by Tucker and Slingerland (1997).
Annual precipitation varies with latitude (Figure 9.7), so the trends of sediment yield
versus effective precipitation in Figure 9.5 can be viewed as a latitudinal zonation.
Precipitation values of greater than 1,000 mm yr−1 are mostly restricted to tropical
latitudes, with the exception of wet temperate locations in the southern hemisphere such
as New Zealand and southern Chile. Peaks in sediment yield, which occur at effective
precipitation values of about 300−600 mm yr−1 are found principally in subtropical
latitudes. Since rate of denudation is clearly mediated strongly by vegetation, changes
in land vegetation over the Phanerozoic should modify the picture evident in Figure 9.5
(Schumm, 1968). Key developments were the advent of land vegetation (Late Silurian), the
appearance of horsetails and ferns (Devonian), conifers (Carboniferous), ﬂowering plants
(end Jurassic) and the appearance of grasses near the end of the Cretaceous. Before the
colonisation of the land surface by plants it is expected that there would be a simple linear
trend of increasing sediment yield with increasing precipitation. If so, sediment routing
systems in the Precambrian and the early Palaeozoic would have functioned considerably
differently to those of today.

9.3 Grain-Size Mix of Sediment Supplied to Basins
A key factor in the downstream dispersal and fractionation of sediment is the grain-size
distribution of sediment supplied by upstream catchments. Different distributions of grain
size in the sediment supply to basins affect the pattern of downstream fractionation (Strong
et al., 2005; Fedele and Paola, 2007; Duller et al., 2010; Whittaker et al., 2010; Armitage
et al., 2011; Michael et al., 2013; Michael et al., 2014a; Schlunegger and Norton, 2015).
Building an understanding of the impact of the changing distribution of grain size is vital
for prediction of subsurface sedimentary architectures, gross depositional environments
and sedimentary facies (Strong et al., 2005; Carvajal and Steel, 2012; Michael et al., 2013;
Michael et al., 2014a) and forms a key element in the ﬁelds of sequence stratigraphy
(Chapter 10) and basin analysis. It is important, therefore, to know the characteristics of and
the controls on the grain-size mix serving as an initial condition for down-system dispersal
(Allen et al., 2015b).
It is generally recognised that there is a paucity of information on the grain-size dis-
tributions of the weathering products that deﬁne the initial condition for sediment disper-
sal (Weltje, 2012). The crystal size distribution in crystalline parent rocks, for example,
.010

has been described as log-normal (Eberl, Drits, and Srodon, 1998), but it is not known
whether this is a general rule for other rock types and in regolith comprising rock fragments
and broken particles rather than individual mineralogical crystals. The size distribution
of weathered crystalline rocks such as granites, which have undergone brittle disintegra-
tion, has also been found to be approximated by Rosin’s (exponential) law (Krumbein
and Tisdel, 1940; McEwen, Fessenden, and Rogers, 1959). Crushed materials and those
undergoing mechanical disintegration such as scree, regolith (including on moons and other
planets), pyroclastic material and subglacial tills have also been described by the Rosin
law (Kittleman, 1964; Ibbeken, 1983; Deb and Sen, 2013) and the closely related Weibull
distribution. Other workers have argued that materials that have undergone comminution
commonly have a fractal distribution of size (Hartmann, 1969; Turcotte, 1997; Smalley
et al., 2005; Allen et al., 2015b).
The formation of sediment from parent rocks is part of a general process of ‘fragmenta-
tion’ (Hartmann, 1969; Turcotte, 1997; Smalley et al., 2005). The most important process
of fragmentation in the present context is the breakdown of parent rocks by the processes of
weathering (Wu, Borkovee, and Sticher, 1993; Bitelli, Campbell, and Flury, 1999; Wells,
Willgoose, and Hancock, 2008). Weathering is an example of fragment size reduction,
resulting in soils, sediment and regolith containing ﬁne-grained particles (Jefferson et al.,
1997). This process of fragment size reduction, or comminution, is well known to result in
fractal distributions of grain size (Hyslip and Vallejo, 1997) (Figure 9.8).
If the grain-size distribution of the sediment released into the cascade from source to
sink (Burt and Allison, 2010) is to be modelled in a geomorphic context, it is necessary to

account for the combined effects of parent rock lithology and microstructure, topography,
climate and the passage of time on the fragmentation process. However, in the context of
geological sediment routing systems, the range of controls on the particle size distribution
of sediment exported to sedimentary basins needs to be reduced to as few parameters as
possible so that the method can be used where little is known about the contributing catch-
ment areas, including their location, size, morphometry, climate and lithological make-up
(Sømme et al., 2009).
If a parent rock breaks into smaller pieces, which themselves break into smaller pieces,
and so on, we should expect the number of fragments N with a size greater than a certain
linear dimension x to decrease as the linear dimension increases. The number of fragments
with a linear dimension greater than x can be expressed by the fractal number relation
N(X > x) = Cx−Df
(9.15)
where Df is the fractal dimension associated with fragmentation and C is a coefﬁcient.
Df is typically between 2 and 4 for a range of fragment types over 4 to 5 orders of
magnitude of x (Figure 9.8). The number of fragments can be substituted by the volume
or mass of sediment with particle sizes greater than a certain linear dimension to enable
comparison with empirical plots of grain-size distribution derived from sieving (Tyler and
Wheatcraft, 1992; Hyslip and Vallejo, 1997). In such a case, equation (9.15) is modiﬁed
from its number-speciﬁc form to a weight-speciﬁc form:
P(X < x) = M(X > x)
MT
=
 x
xmax
m
(9.16)
where P is the proportion by weight of particles smaller than the sieve size x, M is the
weight (or mass) smaller than the sieve size, MT is the total weight of sediment sieved,
xmax is the maximum sieve or screen size (through which all particles pass), and m is an
index of the spread of the particle size distribution given by the slope of the power law
represented by equation (9.15). Since particle volume or weight is related to the cube of
particle number (Turcotte, 1997), the parameter m is related to the fractal dimension by
Df = 3 −m
(9.17)
Using equation 9.15, it can be seen that when the grain-size distribution is heavily loaded
with ﬁne particles the fractal dimension is large, and when the grain-size distribution is
loaded with coarse particles the fractal dimension is small.
It can reasonably be expected that the grain-size distributions of sediment released
from catchments will be similar to those of crushed or mechanically disintegrated mate-
rials rather than to sediments that have undergone profound reworking and sorting during
transport. Hydraulic sorting during transport is thought to generate grain-size distributions
of exponential or log-normal types (Section 9.4.2) (McEwen et al., 1959; Middleton, 1976;
Ibbeken, 1983; Allen et al., 2015b). A number of different regolith and sediment types have
therefore been analysed that might approximate the time-averaged characteristics of the
sediment efﬂux of upland catchments on geological timescales. These materials include (1)

etched into a region of active uplift at 1−1.5 mm yr−1 in northeastern Sicily; (2) coarse
sediment at the outlet points of catchments distributed along strike of topographic ranges
in Sicily and Basilicata-Campania, southern Italy; and (3) weathering products (regolith) in
catchments in southern Italy developed on a range of different rock types. Together, these
data sets provide a good idea of the typical fractal dimensions of sediments and regolith
stored in upland catchments prior to export to sedimentary basins.
Details of sample localities and the methods used to collect particle size data are given
in Allen et al. (2015b). The fractal dimension can be calculated in two ways. First, taking
the logarithm of both sides of equation (9.16) gives a straight line relationship between
M(X < x)/MT and x/xmax if the distribution is fractal (Figure 9.9), where the slope is
.010
15:11:10

9.3 Grain-Size Mix of Sediment Supplied to Basins
313
m = 3 −Df (equation (9.17)). Equation (9.16) has been used to determine the fractal
dimension from sieve data collected at 19 localities at the outlets of Sicilian catchments.
Second, the value of the fractal dimension at each station along the main channel of 3 catch-
ments in Sicily was interpolated by taking the proportion by weight at two characteristic
grain sizes, D84 and D50, using a modiﬁcation of equation (9.16):
m = logP(X < D84) −logP(X < D50)
log(D84) −log(D50)
(9.18)
where P(D84) and P(D50) are the proportions by weight smaller than the 84th and 50th
percentiles respectively.
The estimated values of fractal dimension from weathering products can be compared
with those for sediment at the outlets of catchments in the same region. Sediment at the
outlets of 23 catchments along the Vallo di Diano and East Agri faults in Campania-
Basilicata have an average fractal dimension of 2.42 using the interpolation method. This
value reﬂects the mixed bedrock lithologies, and is very close to the average of the weather-
ing products in the tectonically uplifting catchments, showing that weathering products are
little modiﬁed during the process of sediment mobilisation before export to adjacent basins.
In addition, the variation in fractal dimension at catchment outlets is small compared to
the variation in the regolith caused by lithological controls. This suggests that although
the average fractal dimension changes little from regolith to catchment outlet, the source
materials undergo some homogenisation. It is expected that large catchments are more
effective at homogenisation than small, but no relationship between fractal dimension and
contributing drainage area is evident.
In summary, the fractal dimension of weathering products and sediment at catchment
outlets in southern Italy are identical and are a good indicator of the grain-size mix of
the sediment supply to sedimentary basins. Likewise, in Sicily, the fractal dimensions of
sediment sampled at a number of stations along the main trunk channels of three catchments
are indistinguishable from those calculated from sediment at catchment outlets (Allen et al.,
2015b).
9.3.1 Simulations Using a Variable Grain-Size Mix in the Supply
Simulations are carried out using a physical sediment transport model in order to test the
sensitivity of stratigraphic architectures to variations in the grain-size characteristics of the
supply.
Although the fractal dimension has the advantage of describing the grain-size distribu-
tion of sediment in one number, fractal distributions do not have meaningful values of mean
and standard deviation since they are scale invariant. The fractal power law, represented by
equation (9.15), however, has the same form as the Pareto distribution, which is described
by a shape parameter a representing the spread of the distribution and a scale parameter
k representing the minimum grain size (Schroeder, 1991; Hastings and Sugihara, 1993;
Vidondo et al., 1997). The unknown parameters of the Pareto distribution can be evaluated
by interpolation between speciﬁed grain-size values. Here, interpolation is carried out using
values of the 84th and 50th percentiles derived from the cumulative function distribution

down-system distance x∗= x/L, L is the total depositional length of interest in the sed-
iment routing system, y∗(x∗) is the cumulative down-system sediment deposition in the
normalised (mass balance) coordinate system, and C is a coefﬁcient that describes the rate
of decrease in mean grain size in the down-system direction. If the initial mean grain size
is 60 mm, and the normalised cumulative down-system deposition is 0.5 (that is, half of the
total sediment has been deposited), the mean grain size of the deposit ranges from 36 to 47
mm for values of C between 1 and 0.5 respectively. C therefore reﬂects the fractionation of
clasts from the surface ﬂux, which depends on its variance of grain size. This in turn should
be inversely dependent on the Pareto shape parameter of the sediment supply. C is taken to
be 0.75 in the simulations. The value of μP is used as the mean of the sediment supply μ0
in equation (9.22), which becomes
μ(x∗) = akP
a −1exp(−Cy∗)
(9.23)
Equation (9.22) is a simpliﬁed version of that proposed by Fedele and Paola (2007) and
applied by Duller et al. (2010) and Armitage et al. (2011), described in Section 9.4.3, which
includes terms for variance of the grain-size distribution.
A plot of σ0/μ0 (where σ0 is the standard deviation in the sediment supply and μ0 is
the mean grain size in the supply) using clast count data from catchment outlets along the
topographic range front in Sicily and Campania-Basilicata, and from weathering products
in Campania-Basilicata and Calabria, versus fractal dimension and Pareto shape parameter
is shown in Figure 9.10. As Df increases and a decreases, there is an increasing contribution
to the distribution from small fragments, which is reﬂected in an increase in the value of
σ0/μ0. Most values of σ0/μ0 fall in the range 0.6 −1.7, which corresponds to the range of
2 < Df < 3 and 0 < a < 2.22 found in the southern Italian and Sicilian data sets. This
range of σ0/μ0 is employed in the numerical simulations.
Simulations of the downstream ﬁning of mean grain size are carried out with background
subsidence approximated by an exponential function, analogous to an extensional half
graben bounded by a border fault or to a ﬂexural foreland basin (Allen and Allen, 2013).
The discharge of the sediment supply and the spatial distribution of tectonic subsidence are
kept steady during model runs. The surface processes model (Armitage et al., 2013) calcu-
lates sediment transport using the formulation of Smith and Bretherton (1972) with values
of coefﬁcients derived from Simpson and Schlunegger (2003). The boundary conditions
are of ﬁxed elevation at the downstream limit of the system at 10 km and at the head of the
system there is a constant unit width supply of sediment of 1 m2 yr−1 required to ﬁll the
basin.

Sediment Production, Evolution and Provenance
Two sets of simulations are carried out.
1. Set A: A simple exponential decline in mean grain size is combined with the physical
sediment transport model with step-like (A1) and gradual (A2) changes in the starting
mean grain size μP = μ0 (Figure 9.11).
2. Set B: Sediment deposition is governed by the self-similar solution of equation (9.33)
combined with the physical sediment transport model with step-like (B1) and gradual
(B2) changes in the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean grain size in the sediment
supply σ0/μ0 (Figure 9.12). Cv is held constant at 1.2 in the simulations and σ0/μ0
values are derived from ﬁeld clast count data.

In the case of the simple exponential model, the Pareto mean grain size in the sediment
supply is held constant at 35 mm before a step or gradual change at 2.5 Myr model time.
The step change involves a doubling or halving of the Pareto mean followed by 2.5 Myr of
relaxation. In the case of a gradual change, the Pareto mean increases or decreases to values
of 60 mm and 10 mm after 5 Myr model time. In the simulations using the self-similar

solution of Fedele and Paola (2007), the value of σ0/μ0 is set at 1.0 for the ﬁrst 2.5 Myr,
then increases to 1.5 or decreases to 0.5 in step or gradual changes. It is emphasised that
the patterns of grain size in basin stratigraphy shown in the simulations are entirely driven
by variations in the statistical properties of the grain-size mix of the sediment supply.
Simulations using the simple exponential model show marked shifts in grain size at
the time of the step change. A step-like increase in the mean size of the sediment supply
causes an abrupt upward coarsening and the down-system extension of the gravel front,
followed by gradual retrogradation, producing a tongue or sheet of coarse gravel. A step-
like decrease in mean grain size of the supply causes an abrupt upward ﬁning and retraction
of the gravel front. A gradual increase in the mean size of the supply causes an upward
coarsening, but the trend is relatively slow and leads to long-term progradation. Likewise,
the gradual reduction in the mean size of the supply results in a basin-wide ﬁning in
stratigraphy and long-term retrogradation.
Sedimentary architectures generated in simulations using the self-similar solution are
consistent with those using the simple exponential model. A step-like increase in the ratio
σ0/μ0 results in a pronounced gravel tongue, whereas the step-like descrease produces a
surface marked by strong but short-lived retrogradation. A gradual increase in the ratio
σ0/μ0 causes an increase in progradation, resulting in a long-term trend of upward coars-
ening. A gradual decrease causes long-term retrogradation and slow upward ﬁning.
9.4 Grain-Size Fractionation in Sediment Routing Systems
9.4.1 Downstream Changes in Hydraulic Geometry
The downstream ﬁning of grain size in river channels is accompanied by changes in the
hydraulic geometry of the channels. Parker (1978b) suggested that gravel bed rivers con-
ﬁgured themselves so that the shear stress on the bed at the centre of the channel is in excess
of the critical stress required to entrain the median grain size. That is,
τ0
τc 50
= ϵ
(9.24)
This excess stress factor ϵ has been estimated at 1.2 −1.8 (meaning 20 −80% excess)
in gravel reaches (Figure 9.13). Beyond the gravel front, however, the excess stress factor
increases markedly to greater than 10, accompanied by an abrupt decrease in D50 and slope.
By invoking the resistance equation for steady ﬂow down an inclined plane and assuming
that τc 50 ∝D50, equation (9.24) can be modiﬁed to
ϵ =
ρgRS

where R is the hydraulic radius and k contains all the constants. That is, a downstream ﬁning
in the median grain size D50 only occurs where the product RS decreases downstream.
Downstream variation in the hydraulic radius may be complex, particularly as a result of
changes in channel width. Robinson and Slingerland (1998) compared a number of regime
equations in terms of their success in predicting the variation in ϵ and channel width W
across the gravel front. The best ﬁt with observational data for 70 Canadian rivers was with
W = 3.83Q0.528

following Bray (1982), where the coefﬁcient is likely to vary from approximately 1 to 4.5
depending on vegetation. A value of ∼2 is thought appropriate for rivers with cohesive,
vegetated banks. In equation (9.27), a reduction of grain size causes ﬂow width to increase,
and an increase in discharge of water also causes the ﬂow width to increase. For example,
if the water discharge is 100 m3 s−1 and the median grain size is 0.02 m in the gravel reach,
channel width W = 57m. In the sand reach, if the median grain size decreases to 0.0005 m
and the water discharge does not change, the river nearly doubles its width to W = 107 m.
9.4.2 Fractionation of Grain Size During Dispersal
It is not clear what changes take place in the grain-size distribution of sediment as it
is mobilised from regolith, transported and sorted by hydraulic processes and eventually

selectively extracted from the surface ﬂux and transfered to the substrate. These various
processes are likely to have a multiplicative effect (Dacey and Krumbein, 1979).
McEwen, Fessenden, and Rogers (1959) suggested that processes associated with trans-
port such as abrasion and fracturing caused the grain-size distribution to be modiﬁed,
stating that (p.492)
The cumulative effect of the various agents and processes acting on the sediment after its formation
will, in general, impose a log-normal size distribution on the sediment.
If this were the case, it would be in agreement with the long-held view that the size
distribution of transported sediments is commonly log-normal (Krumbein, 1938).
Allen et al. (2016) compared exponential (Rosin and Weibull ‘laws’), Pareto and log-
normal statistical models in ﬁtting grain-size data collected from a range of sediment types
involving different amounts of transport. Although these unimodal statistical models do
not allow for mixing of end-member size distributions (Weltje and Prins, 2003), systematic
variations in the goodness-of-ﬁt of models to observed gravel-grade sediment size distribu-
tions allow the impact of mobilisation and transport to be assessed.
Sediment types were sampled from the regolith and bedload sediment of trunk channels
in catchments serving as source regions (southern Italy and Sicily), proximal debris ﬂow
deposits that have suffered little granulometric change during emplacement (Owens Valley,
California), and ﬂuvial gravels that have been transported far from source (Eocene-lower
Oligocene Escanilla and Antist systems of the southern Pyrenees of northern Spain and
Miocene-Pliocene of the Great Plains, United States) (Figure 9.14).
The closeness of the cumulative distribution functions of the Pareto, Weibull and log-
normal models to the observed cumulative function distribution of ﬁeld data can be eval-
uated quantitatively using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov vertical difference parameter DKS.
This parameter is the greatest deviation of a cumulative distribution function of grain-size
data from a reference or model cumulative distribution. Consequently, small values of DKS
indicate a close ﬁt.
Ibbeken (1983) found that although jointed and weathered bedrock in southern Calabria,
Italy, had a Rosin (Weibull) distribution, gravelly sediments sampled near the mouths of
rivers where they enter the Ionian Sea, up to 20 km distant, were commonly bimodal
with a sand fraction that was log-normally distributed. The log-normal property of sands is
most likely imparted by transport processes causing hydraulic sorting (Middleton, 1976). A
comparison of the goodness of ﬁt of sediment in the erosional engine, at catchment outlets
and as far-ﬁeld ﬂuvial gravel shows that the Rosin (Weibull) distribution is the poorest ﬁt,
particularly in far-ﬁeld gravels (Figure 9.15). The log-normal distribution and the truncated
Pareto distribution improve in the closeness of their ﬁt with ﬁeld data with increasing
mobilisation and transport. This suggests that increasing ﬂuvial transport enhances the
log-normality of clast size distributions, as suggested by Krumbein (1938) and McEwen,
Fessenden, and Rogers (1959).
Although fragment sizes in sedimentary materials from regolith to far-ﬁeld gravel have a
broad log-normality, increasing down-system, the Pareto model, base truncated to account

coarser half of the clast size distribution of ﬁeld data from source to sink, and has the
advantage of having a shape parameter that is potentially diagnostic of sediment trans-
port and depositional processes. This shape parameter is well constrained in the erosional
engine. On release into sediment transport systems, the clast size distribution may evolve
predictably, moderated by the role of selective deposition. At short transport distances,
shown by the Escanilla system, rapid deposition in proximal positions causes the extraction

of the coarsest grains into stratigraphy, causing the shape parameter a to decrease from
the value associated with the sediment supply from the erosional engine (Figure 9.16). At
longer transport distances, or at positions further down-system in terms of the total mass
balance (Martin et al., 2009; Michael et al., 2013), shown by the Great Plains system, the
clast size distribution is enriched in relatively small particles compared to the sediment
supply because of up-system selective deposition combined with abrasion during transport,
increasing the shape parameter a (Figure 9.14). Consequently the Pareto shape parameter
can potentially be used as an indication of proximality.
Despite the large down-system changes in mean grain size and gravel percentage
from source region to depositional sink, particle size distributions appear to maintain
log-normality over a wide range of transport distance. Consequently, full grain-size
distributions can be predicted within the terrestrial segment of sediment routing systems
given simple laws of downstream ﬁning. These full grain-size distributions may help
to inform the estimation of hydraulic properties of aquifers and oil and gas reservoirs,
such as porosity and permeability. Use of statistical models therefore enables down-
system fractionation of sediment released from source regions to be better understood and
predicted and is a potentially valuable tool in source-to-sink approaches to basin analysis.

9.4.3 Down-System Fining of Gravel by Selective Deposition
In the absence of tributary inputs of sediment, grain size ﬁnes downstream in river systems.
Basin-wide grain-size trends may be controlled by the relative mobility of mass, whereby
the less mobile clasts are extracted ﬁrst by a process of selective deposition. In many
sedimentary systems, the observed rate of ﬁning is too rapid to be explained by abra-
sion alone (Attal and Lavé, 2009) and consequently selective deposition must dominate.
Field-based, numerical and laboratory studies (Toro-Escobar et al., 1996; Seal et al., 1997;
.010
15:11:10

324
Sediment Production, Evolution and Provenance
Sheets et al., 2002; Fedele and Paola, 2007; Paola et al., 2009; Duller et al., 2010; Armitage
et al., 2011; Whittaker et al., 2011; Paola and Martin, 2012; Parsons et al., 2012; Rohais
et al., 2012) have focused on understanding and decoding regional grain-size trends in this
context.
Over many repeated sediment transport events, a portion of the mobile sediment ﬂux
is extracted to build stratigraphy. Stratigraphy is therefore a strongly ﬁltered record of this
succession of sediment transport events. The selective extraction of mass from the mobile
sediment ﬂux during downstream transport produces a characteristic trend in preserved
grain size. This grain-size trend in turn affects ﬂuvial style and depositional environments
(Strong et al. 2005). Critical to the prediction of downstream ﬁning (Fedele and Paola,
2007; Duller et al., 2010; Whittaker et al., 2011; Allen and Heller, 2012) is the inﬂuence
of the spatial distribution of tectonic subsidence σ(x) on the downstream trend in the long-
term sediment transport rate qs(x) (Figure 9.17). This downstream trend in qs(x) reﬂects
the interplay between the volumetric discharge of the sediment supply and the volume
extracted to ﬁll accommodation.
The impact of deposition is to reduce the sediment discharge qs in the downstream
direction from its initial value qs(0) at x=0. Eventually, the sediment supply is exhausted
at a depositional length Ld. At each point in the downstream direction x < Ld the solid
sediment volume extracted by deposition as a fraction of the surface sediment ﬂux is
(1 −φ)σ(x)/qs(x), where φ is the porosity of the deposited sediment. The mean grain
size of the deposited stratigraphy therefore depends on the grain-size characteristics in the
supply and the downstream extraction controlled by the spatial distribution of deposition.
Consequently, granulometric trends are potentially valuable in constraining parameters
describing the volumetric budget of sediment routing systems (Whittaker et al., 2011;
Parsons et al., 2012).
Since both qs(x) and σ(x) are determined by the tectonics and climate of the basin
and its hinterlands, different basin types are expected to contain sediment routing systems
with characteristic rates of downstream ﬁning. For example, it is possible to discriminate
between catchment-fan systems ﬁlling small wedge-top basins in thrust belts, which have
rapid rates of downstream ﬁning, from large, coalesced ﬂuvial systems spreading sediment
from the cores of mountains belts to distant foredeeps, which have low rates of downstream
ﬁning (Duller et al., 2010; Whittaker et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2013).
Allowing for the porosity (φ) of deposited sediment, and deﬁning the depositional length
Ld as the point at which the sediment discharge is exhausted, the downstream variation of
the sediment discharge can be written
qs(x) = qs(0) −(1 −φ)
	 Ld
0
σ(x)dx
(9.28)
The sediment discharge can be calculated for different analytical expressions of the
accommodation, or the model initialised with ﬁeld observations. As an example, if the
accommodation is given by an exponential model, decreasing away from the source region
with a decay constant a, so that σ(x) = σmaxexp(−ax), equation (9.28) becomes

the application in Duller et al. (2010).
The grain-size trend therefore reﬂects the grain-size distribution of the sediment supply,
the sediment discharge from the upstream source, and the spatial distribution of accommo-
dation (Duller et al., 2010; Parsons et al., 2012) (Figure 9.18). The rate of down-system

9.4.4 Effects of Climate Change on Grain-Size Trends
In the rivers of the High Plains of the United States (Figure 9.19), which drain the Rocky
Mountains, channel slopes have decreased since the Miocene (McMillan, Angevine, and
Heller, 2002), suggesting that they have responded to climatic mechanisms rather than
tectonic (see Wobus, Tucker, and Anderson (2010) for a discussion of the differentiation of
climatic and tectonic forcing on river long proﬁles). There is a twofold increase in median
grain size of sediment exported from the Rocky Mountains across the Miocene-Pliocene
boundary (Duller et al., 2012) (Figure 9.20). This twofold increase is attributed to climatic

by assuming that local shear stresses on the bed are 1.4 times the critical shear stress (Paola

estimates of unit width water dsicharge qw (Figure 9.20b). D50 and H are constrained
from ﬁeld observations. The doubling of median grain size of the supply between the
Miocene and Pliocene is associated with an increase in water discharge from 1−3 m2 s−1 to
3 −6 m2 s−1, and the thick succession of Pliocene Broadwater sediments suggest aggrada-
tion on the Great Plains after 3.7 Ma, consistent with high rates of sediment supply.

In numerical models where erosion has the form of a diffusive-concentrative equation
(Smith and Bretherton, 1972; Simpson and Schlunegger, 2003) including a term for tectonic
uplift, precipitation was doubled and halved (from a steady-state value of 1 m yr−1) in
order to investigate the effect of climate change on the grain-size distribution and stratal
geometries in the basin (Whittaker et al., 2011). Doubling of the mean annual precipitation
generated a sharp increase in sediment ﬂux before returning to a steady-state value with a
response time of about 0.5 Myr. The increased sediment ﬂux causes a lengthening of the
fan and an increase in median grain size. A halving of the precipitation rate causes a sharp
reduction in sediment ﬂux that returns to the steady-state value with a response time of
approximately 1 Myr. The reduced sediment ﬂux causes an abrupt backstepping of the fan
toe and shrinkage of the fan. This backstepping is accompanied by an increase in the rate
of down-system grain-size ﬁning.
An increase in precipitation will increase the sediment grain size exported from the
catchment because channel bed grain size scales on bed shear stress. The coupling between
an increase in precipitation and an increase in sediment calibre leads to the marked progra-
dation down-system of a gravel sheet with a duration of the order of the response time. The
deposition of conglomeratic sheets down-system has previously been linked to increases in
precipitation in the upstream catchment (Heller and Paola, 1992).

The Palaeocene-Eocene boundary (55 Ma) in the Tremp Basin of the Spanish Pyrenees
coincides with the presence of the Claret conglomerate sheet (Figure 9.21). The Claret
Conglomerate is about 1 −4 m-thick (locally up to 8 m) and bounded above and below
by different paleosols that indicate an increase in precipitation rate over time (Schmitz
and Pujalte, 2007). Climates and environments changed from semi-arid alluvial plains with
small channels to a vast conglomeratic braidplain under a much wetter climate regime.
The Claret Conglomerate is an extensive sheet with an erosive, low-relief base, covering
an area of at least 500 km2. However, the source of the conglomerate lay approximately
10 km to the northeast of the most proximal outcrops, so the braidplain may have covered
an area of 2,000 km2 at the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary. Maximum clast size is 65 mm,
much coarser than pebbles in underlying channels, which rarely exceed 25 mm. The braid-
plain formed over a short time period of a few thousand years (∼10 ky) directly after the
Palaeocene-Eocene boundary. Such a short-lived pulse is consistent with the timescale of a
transient response to a climatic perturbation in the model runs of Armitage et al. (2011).
The Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) is registered in the marine time-
equivalent stratigraphy of the Pyrenean Gulf in the form of a 2–4 m-thick (locally

Baceta, and Schmitz, 2015). The clays represent a massive input of terrestrial siliciclastic
sediment into the ocean attributable to the profound hydrological changes associated with
the PETM. In addition, coarse-grained siliciclastics inﬁlled incised valleys and a long-lived
deep marine channel. The presence of coarse and ﬁne-grained terrestrial siliciclastics in
the Pyrenean Gulf coeval with the development of an extensive ﬂuvial braidplain illustrates
the down-system propagation of the climate signal through the sediment routing system.
9.5 Linking Source to Sink: Provenance Tools
The English poet William Blake wrote in ‘Auguries of Innocence’ (written 1803, published
1863):
To see a world in a grain of sand
And a heaven in a wild ﬂower,
Hold inﬁnity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.
‘Auguries of Innocence’ contains a number of paradoxes where innocence stands along-
side evil and corruption. An augury is a sign or omen. I doubt that Blake was thinking
of provenance when he wrote those lines, but I do think he was marvelling at the big
picture contained in small things, together with the contradictions and tensions. It seems
improbable at ﬁrst sight that global climate changes and tectonic movements might be

reﬂected in the properties of a grain of sand. ‘To see a world’ of vanished source areas
from a ‘grain of sand’ is an example of an inverse approach in the study of provenance.
Provenance studies using the inversion of multiple proxies are a powerful way of linking
sources to sinks, but do not capture the transformations that take place during weathering
and transport. To develop models of such transformations, both compositional and textural,
requires forward modelling calibrated by targeted ﬁeld observations.
The chief inverse method of linking source to sink is to match the petrography, miner-
alogy, or chemistry of detrital grains to a source region using speciﬁc tracers. For many
years a range of techniques has been applied to the study of the provenance of sand-
grade sediment, including analysis of light fraction petrography (Zuffa, 1985) and heavy
minerals (Mange and Maurer, 1992; Mange and Wright, 2007). Bulk and single-mineral
geochemistry, isotopes and thermochronometers are increasingly used to constrain both the
location and rock type of source areas and their exhumation history. U-Pb geochronology
of detrital zircons allows the ages of eroding parent rocks to be identiﬁed and provides
valuable insights into provenance.
The crystallisation age of zircons can be measured using the U-Pb decay series, usu-
ally with laser ablation ICP mass spectrometry. The distribution of U-Pb crystallisation
ages can be compared with cooling ages obtained from ﬁssion track analysis of detrital
and bedrock zircon samples. Double-dating allows zircon ages representing slow cooling
during exhumation to be discriminated from ages representing rapid crystallisation due to
volcanic or plutonic activity (Garver et al., 2000). Using U-Pb ages of detrital zircons to
identify source regions and understand sediment trajectories is now a very well established
and standard provenance tool. It is commonly used in conjunction with an analysis of heavy
minerals, clast compositions and light fraction petrography (as an example, see Nicholson
et al. (2014)).
Data sets containing U-Pb ages, heavy mineral point counts and petrographic point
counts need to be extensive in order to be statistically meaningful. Consequently, statis-
tical techniques are employed to quantify the pairwise distance between sample attributes
that are fed into a multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm (Vermeesch, 2013). MDS
visualises data as a map that preserves the difference between samples as relative distances
between data points. An example is the analysis of sand samples from the Taklamakan
desert to discriminate between a northerly provenance by wind and a southerly and westerly
provenance by ﬂowing water (Rittner et al., 2016). Consideration of heavy mineral, petro-
graphic and U-Pb geochronological data collected from river bed and aeolian dune sands
in the Taklamakan desert and from possible source areas surrounding the Tarim Basin
(Figure 9.22) allowed the authors to conclude that the bulk of the sand originates from
rivers draining the mountains in the southeast (Altun Shan), south (Kunlun Shan) and west
(Pamir), but not by winds blowing predominantly from the Junggar Basin and Altai in the
north.
Bulk petrography is analysed by point counting, using quartz, feldspar and lithic frag-
ments as the main grain types. Lithic fragments are commonly subdivided into volcanic,
sedimentary and metamorphic varieties. Mineralogy is conventionally illuminated from

zircon index GZi to compare modern sands with older stratigraphy.
The sand in the Taklamakan desert can also be compared with the aeolian dust compris-
ing the Chinese Loess Plateau and with other desert regions of NE China such as the Mu
Us and Tengger deserts, and with the sediment load of the Yellow River (Figure 9.23). The
Yellow River shows the closest afﬁnity to loess sediments, as well as to the Mu Us desert,
but there is no evidence to suggest that the Taklamakan desert is the source of dust for the
Chinese Loess Plateau.

processes are not expected to result in isotopic fractionation, so the measured isotopic
signature of any given sediment should reﬂect the bulk composition of the source. For
example, 143Nd/144Nd isotopic values in clays recovered from the Bengal Fan are similar
to those of modern sediments in the Ganga River (Goldstein, O’Nions, and Hamilton, 1984)
and Bengal Fan sediments have been linked to denudation of source regions in the Himalaya
(Bouquillon et al., 1990).
Eocene sedimentary rocks from the Gulf of Tonkin are uniformly less negative in ϵNd
than modern Red River sediment, indicating that Eocene sediments are more radiogenic
and have younger crustal sources than the modern Red River. The Eocene samples are
closer, however, to the ϵNd of Tibetan sources for the Upper Yangtze River. Pb isotope
analysis of single grains of feldspar allows further discrimination of the basement sources
for the Eocene of the Gulf of Tonkin and supports the existence of Tibetan sources, but the
differences with the modern Red River samples suggests that the Gulf of Tonkin received
Yangtze Block detritus from the Middle Yangtze River before drainage capture by the
Red River at some stage after the Eocene (Clift, Layne, and Blusztajn, 1994). A similar
approach (Pb and Nd) was taken to the sediments of the River Indus (Clift et al., 2001b,
2002), supplemented by analysis of garnet geochemistry (Alizai, Clift, and Still, 2016).
Provenance tools are therefore capable of highlighting major river drainage reorganisation
events in contributing source areas.

Sediment Routing Systems and Sequence Stratigraphy
In 2008, Philip Allen wrote (2008b) (p.23):
The more we make steps in understanding landscapes and sediment routing systems, the more we
discern their complex response to perturbations of all types. Had such information been available
previously to guide stratigraphic models, it is arguable that the entire ﬁeld of sequence stratigra-
phy ...would have developed differently.
This is not to say that sequence stratigraphy and sediment routing system research are
at war with each other, or that they occupy two distinct philosophical schools and ‘social
worlds’ (Clarke, 1991). The two approaches to the understanding of stratigraphy are
complementary and should ideally be used in tandem (Helland-Hansen et al., 2016).
Nevertheless, the difference in approach of numerical modelling, which investigates
through simulations the effect on stratigraphic architectures of variations in controlling
parameters, and currently practised sequence stratigraphy, which, it is claimed, makes
observations on stratigraphic architectures irespective of the controls, has been recently
highlighted (Cantuneanu and Zecchin, 2016). With this purist methodology, sequence
stratigraphy is rather like making a geological map in the ﬁeld: boundaries are deﬁned and
mapped irrespective of their interpretation. Hence, Cantuneanu and Zecchin (2016) state
(p.185) that
numerical modeling . . . has no bearing on the sequence stratigraphic workﬂow or methodology.
But what makes stratigraphy interesting and valuable is its use to unravel and understand
the ‘epic poem of the Earth’ (see Preface) in an explanatory sense. Integrated system-type
approaches to the fate of sediment from source to sink, including numerical modelling,
have the power to fundamentally inform the sequence stratigraphy narrative, particularly
in terms of the forcing mechanisms for observed architectural patterns and trends.

Sediment Routing Systems and Sequence Stratigraphy
architectures, are better displayed by the Quaternary record of continental margins (Lobo
and Ridente, 2014; Ridente, 2016). High-frequency cycles are best preserved where high
sediment supply rates combine with tectonic subsidence beneath continental shelves, and
where the shallow depths of burial allow high-quality seismic reﬂection imagery.
The sea level history of the Quaternary under the inﬂuence of orbitally driven
glacial-interglacial climate change is well understood. Sea level excursions in the
Quaternary reﬂect Milankovitch climate cycles of period approximately 20, 40 and 100 kyr
(Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton, 1976; Schwarzacher, 2000). Such cycles are asymmetrical,
involving abrupt warming during ice cap melting and gradual cooling during ice cap
growth. They are also high in amplitude, of order 100 m sea level change in the case
of 100 kyr cycles. These high-amplitude, asymmetrical cycles are recognised in the
depositional architectures of continental margins (Yoo and Park, 2000; Lobo and Ridente,
2014). The most prominent feature is progradation of the shelf, which may occur during
highstand, falling and lowstand phases. Rapid sea level rise is generally recorded by
thinner, aggradational distal drapes and reworked deposits forming patchy clinoforms or
channel-ﬁll deposits. The stratigraphic architecture of Quaternary margins therefore differs
from expectations from the prototype model in Vail et al. (1977) and its later derivatives
(Wilgus et al., 1988) (Figure 10.1).
In Quaternary systems, such as the Korea Strait (Yoo and Park, 2000), where asymmet-
rical, high-amplitude sea level cycles are known to have taken place, sediment supply to
the shelf does not decrease signiﬁcantly during slow sea level fall, and sediment bypass
of the shelf is restricted to the end of the falling stage. The lowstand stage is therefore
marked by an elongate deltaic wedge of sandy muds and shelly sands deposited beyond
the shelf edge, with no lowstand turbiditic fans. The transgressive deposits of sands and
gravels are thin and retrogradational. The highstand is associated with the progradation of
a muddy prodelta-shelf complex fed from rivers and is restricted to the inner shelf only.
Fine sediment is unable to reach the outer shelf because of strong currents. Quaternary
high-frequency sequences, such as those of the Korean Strait, therefore, are quite unlike
the standard models based on Mesozoic-Cenozoic greenhouse cycles of 1–3 Myr period.
Despite the strong inﬂuence of relative sea level change on Quaternary margins,
sequence architectures differ from place to place due to variations in tectonic uplift
and subsidence and sediment supply driven by external forcings and/or internal dynamics
(Figure 10.2). Such variability particularly affects lowstand deposition. Close to river
input points, sediment discharges may be high enough to construct perched lowstand
units composed of coarse-grained deltaic deposits, or to cause large-scale shelf margin
and slope progradation (Porebski and Steel, 2003), as in the lowstand scheme of the
conventional sequence stratigraphic model. Where sediment supply from deltaic sources is
less important, slope progradation is impeded.
The sequence geometries found on Quaternary margins are strongly inﬂuenced by the
amplitude and duration of sea level excursions. The predominance of 100 kyr cycles over
the last 800 kyr has largely masked any stratigraphic expression of shorter-period cyclicity
(20 and 40 kyr). During the Early Pleistocene and Holocene these shorter-period orbital

cycles are better expressed. A lengthening of cycle duration and a reduction of sea level
amplitude would, according to some authors (Ridente, 2016), result in the sequence geome-
tries proposed in the conventional sequence model, in which sediment dynamics and other
allocyclic mechanisms take on an enhanced role compared to the Quaternary icehouse. The
possibility exists, however, that greenhouse ‘cycles’ are not part of any ordered hierarchy
(Schlager, 2004; Burgess, 2016) (Section 10.4).
The 100 kyr cycles that dominate Middle-Upper Pleistocene stratigraphy consist of
sets of shelf sequences, each a few to tens of metres thick, enclosed by marked shelf-wide
unconformities resulting from subaerial erosion and reworking during marine transgression
(Figure 10.3). Individual sequences are dominated by regresssive deposits recording overall
continuous progradation from highstand to lowstand of sea level. Since glacio-eustatic
cycles involve a slow sea level fall and abrupt rise, the phase of progradation comprises

patchy and limited (Lobo and Ridente, 2014). Sediments deposited during falling sea
level are relatively uniform, whereas those deposited during highstands and lowstands
are more variable. Highstand units typically form at the base of or alternate with falling
stage sediments, especially on muddy shelves. Lowstand sediments vary from shelf margin
deltas to shorefaces, depending on the local supply of sediment and hydrodynamic setting
of the shelf.
Quaternary marine sediment routing systems have the potential to yield quantitative
data on the rates and periodicity of sediment supply to the deep sea, and on the external

or internal processes responsible. Geologically young marine records have the beneﬁt
of higher chronological resolution than the bulk of the Phanerozoic, provided by dating
techniques including radiocarbon, and correlation with global oxygen isotope records. In
addition, deep marine stratigraphy is more complete than terrestrial and shallow marine
equivalents (Section 7.7.3). In the following paragraphs, Quaternary examples are given of
the routing of sediment to the deep sea that illustrate the varied roles of sediment pathways,
climate change and sea level change.
One of the best examples of deep marine successions with high chronological resolution
is the Santa Monica Basin in the California Borderland (Romans et al., 2009) (Figure 10.4).
The basin is fed with sediment from the Santa Clara River catchment (Warrick and
Milliman, 2003) and the Santa Barbara littoral cell, which transports coastal sediment from
west to east. The head of the Hueneme submarine canyon intersects the littoral cell. The
Santa Monica Basin has an area of about 2,000 km2 and a maximum water depth of 900 m.
It is a closed basin with a ponded Quaternary ﬁll (Normark, Piper, and Sliter, 2006), with
no signiﬁcant bypass to more distal settings. The Hueneme submarine fan occupies the
western part of the Santa Monica Basin. Sea level has risen about 130 m since the LGM
lowstand (18–25 ka) and reached its present level at ca. 7 ka. During lowstand, when the

shoreline was at the present shelf edge, the Santa Clara and other rivers delivered coarse
grained sediment directly to deep water via submarine canyons. During post-glacial sea
level rise, the Hueneme Canyon maintained a connection to the shallow marine sediment
routing system, allowing Holocene sediment to continue to accumulate on the Hueneme
Fan. New radiocarbon dates from core material, tied to seismic reﬂection data, were used
to calculate a sediment budget over the last 7 kyr (Romans et al., 2009). The average
accumulation rate of sediment for the total duration of ﬁve stratigraphic intervals identiﬁed
from 6.9 ka to the present is 1.3 km3 kyr−1 and the total mass of 3.7 Mt yr−1 compares
well with the estimated sediment ﬂux of the Santa Clara River over historical times (3.2 Mt
yr−1). The average accumulation rate, the average thickness of sand per turbidity current
event, and the background hemipelagic deposition rate all increase from the older half to
the younger half of the 7.9 kyr to present-day succession.
Historical records of the Santa Clara River show a correlation of increased sediment ﬂux
with increased frequency and magnitude of ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) events.
There was a marked increase in frequency at approximately 3 ka. In relation to sea level,
sediment continued to be fed into deep water during the highstand period since 6 ka, since
the Hueneme Canyon maintained its connection to sediment sources (Covault et al., 2007).
The evolution through the last 7 kyr of the Holocene is thought to be a result of the change
from direct river connection to the canyon head to littoral cell connection. The variability
of sediment accumulation rate and sand percentage in the deep-sea Santa Monica Basin is
therefore primarily due to the impact of climatic ENSO events on sediment ﬂux in source
area catchments combined with a switch in the connection of the canyon head with littoral
sediment pathways in the staging area of the sediment routing system.
The role of climate change in the discharge of sediment into deep marine settings has
also been tested in the Santa Ana River catchment, which feeds the Newport deep marine
fan offshore California (Covault et al., 2000) (Figure 10.5). The Newport Fan continued
to receive sediment during the Holocene marine transgression since it stayed connected to
the Santa Ana River mouth. The Santa Ana River has historically delivered high sediment
ﬂuxes during ENSO-related ﬂood events. It dominates the offshore ﬂuxes to the head of
the Newport canyon, with a small contribution from longshore currents of the San Pedro
littoral cell. A variety of climate proxy information indicates the variability of precipitation
in onshore sediment source areas over the last 9.5 kyr (Kirby et al., 2007), from a wet
early Holocene followed by a long-term drying trend. It is inferred that the wet climate
of the early Holocene should be reﬂected in high sediment discharges to the Newport
canyon-fan system. Radiocarbon dates from piston cores taken across the Newport system
allow sediment accumulation rates to be calculated. Average deposition rates calculated
from individual radiocarbon cycles range widely in the latest Pleistocene-Holocene, but
average rates for 1 kyr intervals since 10 ka range between 200–280 mm kyr−1. The
middle Holocene (7–3 ka) experienced the lowest deposition rates. Importantly, variation
of offshore deposition rates is similar to onshore climate proxies, wetter climates being
associated with enhanced deposition rates, and drier climates with reduced deposition rates.
There is little evidence of a time lag between onshore climate change and deposition

in the deep sea in the small scale, steep and tectonically active setting of the California
Borderland.
The Golo sediment routing system is situated on the eastern margin of the island of
Corsica in the western Mediterranean (Figure 10.6). The terrestrial sediment source area is
the Golo River catchment, with an area of 1,005 km2 and mainstem length of 90 km. The
Golo River feeds 0.002 Mt yr−1 of suspended sediment into the ocean. The continental shelf
is narrow (10 km) and extends to a water depth of 110 m. It passes into a deep (700–900 m),
narrow (45 km) conﬁned basin known as the Corsican Trough, which acts as the absorbing
state of the sediment routing system. The entire Golo deep sea fan system covers an area
of approximately 500 km2. A sediment budget (Sømme et al., 2011) shows that onshore
storage of sediment has been relatively minor (about 13% of the overall budget) during the
late Quaternary, and has taken place at all stages of relative sea level, including highstand,
transgression and lowstand (Figure 10.7). The volume of sediment stored in the catchment
(3.4 ± 1.8 km3) is roughly the same as that currently stored on the continental shelf,
whereas the total sediment volume in deep sea fan lobes is 23.7 km3, of which 25–50%
is sand. Deposition in the deep sea has ranged from being 50% higher than the river
supply to 25% lower than the river supply during the late Quaternary, suggesting that the
continental shelf must be acting as a sediment staging area (Sømme et al., 2011), alternately

storing sediment and releasing sediment to the deep sea. Delivery to the deep sea may or
may not be in phase with variations in the river supply and in alluvial aggradation (marked
by terrace formation), making correlation of depositional units within the sediment routing
system and application of the ‘standard’ sequence stratigraphic model problematical.
The Golo system demonstrates that alluvial aggradation and the timing of sediment
delivery to the offshore shelf, slope and deep sea is triggered when external forcing drives
the system across internal thresholds. Consequently, the same external factors may result in
different sequence architectures depending on these internal thresholds. There is no simple
rule of thumb for predicting the timing of deposition of sediment in the deep sea and the
timing of alluvial aggradation (Figure 10.7). The entire Golo system may aggrade along the
entire onshore-offshore transect at any time, in contrast to sequence stratigraphic models
that involve the seaward and landward migration of the main depocentre driven by relative
sea level change.
10.2 Orbitally Driven Signals in Stratigraphy
Orbitally forced climate variations are widely accepted to be registered in stratigraphy, par-
ticularly in the pelagic and hemipelagic environments of lakes, seas and oceans. Cyclicity
is commonly manifested in variations of the concentrations of the skeletons of microﬂora,
detrital silts, clays and wind-blown dust, pollen records as well as in stable isotope ratios,
trace element abundances and even in the gamma ray response of shales from well logs.
In pelagic and hemipelagic environments, Milankovitch cyclicity reﬂects regular changes

The sea level signal contained in δ18O records from deep sea cores has an orbitally
tuned chronology covering the last couple of millions of years (Pillans, Chappell, and
Naish, 1998). The recognition of Milankovitch cyclicity (at 20, 40, 100, 400 kyr period)

has been extended from the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary to older periods of
Earth history, such as the Palaeocene-early Eocene (Hilgen, Kuiper, and Lourens, 2010),
the Oligocene (Paike et al., 2006) and the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (Hilgen, 2007).
Analysis of the gamma ray curves of well logs in the Permo-Carboniferous of the Jiyang
depression, China suggests that orbital forcing can be detected in ancient icehouse periods
of Earth history (Yu et al., 2008).
Some pelagic-hemipelagic and shelfal marine sedimentary sequences have been sub-
jected to time series analysis of variations in bedding thickness to conﬁrm a Milankovitch
band cyclicity (Fischer and Schwarzacher, 1984; Weedon, 1989; Weedon and Jenkyns,
1990). In all these cases, the orbital control of sedimentary rhythms is overwhelmingly by
a direct impact on the depositional environment of changing climate and seasonality, with
little mediation by sediment transport systems. Cyclicity in shallow water marine environ-
ments, such as carbonate platforms, is more controversial, partly because biostratigraphic
resolution is inferior to that in pelagic environments, partly that erosional gaps are more
likely and partly that sedimentary rhythms may reﬂect sediment advection in complex,
heterogeneous depositional mosaics. The classic succession of the Middle Triassic Latemar
carbonate platform of the Alps, for instance, has been interpreted as an excellent example of
Milankovitch-band orbital forcing (Hardie, Bosellini, and Goldhammer, 1986; Hinnov and
Goldhammer, 1991; Zuhlke, Bechstadt, and Mundil, 2003), backed up by spectral analysis
(Preto et al., 2001), whereas improved biostratigraphy and radiometric dating (Brack et al.,
1996; Mundil et al., 1996) make an orbital forcing interpretation problematical.
Milankovitch cyclicity has also been interpreted in the growth of fan lobes in deep
marine, turbiditic successions (Weltje and de Boer, 1993). The changes in the sediment sup-
ply to the delta-fed turbidite system in the Pliocene of Corfu (Greece) is directly attributed
to precession-driven (23 kyr period) changes in precipitation and continental run-off, since
the Mediterranean was cut off from the global ocean at this time and immune from glacial-
interglacial eustatic ﬂuctuations. The 500 m-thick turbiditic succession spans about 500 kyr
and the average thickness of lobe units is 20–25 m, which means that the average time span
for a lobe is 20–25 kyr. The average time span is therefore close to the precession period.
Autocorrelation functions of bed thickness data, magnetic susceptibility and mineralogical
maturity conﬁrm a periodicity of 23–24 kyr. The Pliocene turbidites of Corfu show that
cyclicity in deep marine successions may reﬂect palaeoclimatic changes in the terrestrial
source region driving variations in sediment supply, rather than invoking glacio-eustatic sea
level change (Section 10.2.1).
In terrestrial environments, Milankovitch-scale cyclicity is recorded in lake successions
as cycles in ‘non-glacial varves’ comprising both organic-siliciclastic-carbonate sediments,
as in the Eocene Green River Formation of Utah and Wyoming (Bradley, 1929), and
evaporites, as in the Triassic Lockatong Formation of the Newark rift of New York-New
Jersey (Van Houten, 1964; Olsen, 1984) and the Jurassic Todilto Formation of New Mexico
(Anderson and Kirkland, 1960). Climatic inﬂuences attributed to Milankovitch band forc-
ing are also recognised in trends in aridiﬁcation (Dupont-Nivet et al., 2007), strengthening
and weakening of monsoonal circulation (Xiao et al., 2010) and in the stacking of paleosols
.011

Sediment Routing Systems and Sequence Stratigraphy
in ﬂoodplain successions (Aziz et al., 2008). Once again, in all these cases the inﬂuence of
climate variability is to exert a direct control on the nature of the depositional environment
through changing hydrology and chemistry.
A key question is whether external (allogenic) orbital forcing can be recognised in
more complex sedimentary systems where time-averaged sediment discharges are
affected by the transient response of erosional and depositional landscapes to climate
perturbations (Allen, 2008a). Milankovitch forcing, for example, has been inferred to
explain variations in water and sediment discharge on alluvial fans and in the supply and
rate of accumulation of sediment in the deep sea (Van der Zwan, 2002; Waters, Jones,
and Armstrong, 2010; Covault et al., 2011), and has been invoked to explain periodic
development of anoxia is shallow Cretaceous seas controlled by river input of nutrients
(Beckmann et al., 2005).
10.2.1 Effects of Sea Level Change
There is an abundant record of the effects of Pleistocene-Holocene climate change on
ﬂuvial systems (Bull, 1991), principally in the occurrence of aggradation-incision cycles.
However, the timing of aggradation-incision cycles is not related to base level oscillations
driven by eustatic change in any simple or linear way. The timing of aggradation events
varies from place to place depending on topography and climate, and aggradation surfaces
may be diachronous within a single drainage basin. The frequency of Pleistocene aggrada-
tion events is generally much lower than that of climatically driven sea level highstands and
lowstands (Chappell and Shackleton, 1986). In the Mojave Desert and nearby San Gabriel
Mountains, there are 3 aggradation events over the last 130 kyr, each coinciding with rising
sea level, but there are 11 marine terraces formed at highstands of sea level over the same
time period. These aggradation events coincide with the cutting of strath terraces in humid
ﬂuvial systems in New Zealand, such as the Charwell River (Bull, 1991). Aggradation
events in the Charwell River catchment occurred at times of full glaciation in the Southern
Alps, between the intervals of strath cutting. Aggradation appears to be a complex response
to climate change involving the accumulation of sufﬁcient stored hillslope detritus before
stripping causes aggradation to take place.
Sediment delivery to the ocean reﬂects incision-aggradation cycles rather than simply
conveyance of the products of erosion of upland catchments. There are therefore two
contrasting situations for sediment delivery by river systems, which have been termed ‘con-
veyor belt’ and ‘vacuum cleaner’ modes (Blum and Hattier-Womack, 2009) (Figure 10.8).
The effectiveness of the two different models can be investigated using the Late Quaternary
history of sediment routing systems on the northern Gulf of Mexico continental margin
(Blum and Törnquist, 2000; Blum and Garvin, 2010; Galloway et al., 2011).
The oscillation of sea level is accompanied by climate change in the erosional engines
of sediment routing systems. Consequently, in principle, the sediment efﬂux of upland
catchments should decrease during cold (glacial) climatic phases and increase during warm
(interglacial) climatic phases. Use of the BQART predictor (Syvitski and Milliman, 2007)

Figure 10.8 Conveyor belt versus vacuum cleaner models for sediment supply. The conveyor belt
model involves a large inland drainage basin feeding large amounts of sediment directly to the shelf
margin, whereas the vacuum cleaner model produces smaller quantities of sediment by excavating
an incised valley ﬁll. The vacuum cleaner model generates much smaller quantities of sediment than
the conveyor belt model. From Blum and Hattier-Womack (2009) (ﬁg.11, p.25) with permission of
Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists.
(Section 7.3) suggests that sediment supply may be reduced by 10–40% during glacial
periods corresponding to eustatic lowstands. Consequently, the Late Quaternary record
of sediment discharge from upland catchments, assuming no transient behaviour, should
follow an oscillating path in phase with temperature change during glacial-interglacial
cycles. Periods of incision add little additional sediment to the sediment delivered to the
ocean. Consequently, the sediment supply from the hinterland may be at a maximum when
river mouths are in highstand positions, causing storage to be focussed on the coastal plain
and inner shelf (Figure 10.9). Sediment supply from hinterlands may be at a minimum
when river mouths are extended to the shelf margin during lowstands, when sediment is
fed directly to the slope and deep basin ﬂoor.
Incised valleys form in a stepwise manner, with short periods of incision and extended
periods of lateral channel migration and valley widening during which channel belt sands
are deposited. The total volume of sediment exported during a period of incised valley
formation is, however, small compared to the ongoing conveyor belt from upstream catch-
ments. In contrast, periods of lateral channel migration and valley widening signiﬁcantly
increase sediment export (by 10–30%), so periods of ﬂuvial aggradation correlate with
increased sediment delivery to deep-water depocentres, the reverse of early sequence strati-
graphic thinking (Posamentier and Vail, 1988).

During lowstands, when the shelf is subaerial, channel systems may merge, increasing
drainage area and sediment ﬂux, and therefore increasing delivery to the heads of canyons
incised into the shelf margin (Figure 10.9). In the northern Gulf of Mexico during the Late
Quaternary, the Guadalupe, Lavaca and Colorado systems merged, the combined system
delivering 13 Mt yr−1 of sediment to the lowstand shoreline situated at the shelf edge.
Likewise, the Brazos, Trinity and Sabine rivers merged into one combined system that
delivered 37 Mt yr−1 to the ocean.
In summary, the vacuum cleaner mode of sediment delivery to the ocean is relatively
unimportant (∼5%) compared to the conveyor belt when assessed in terms of their contri-
bution of the total ﬂux to the ocean. Processes such as the temperature-dependent efﬂux of
weathering products from upland catchments and the merging of lowstand river systems on
the exposed shelf are more important in determining the sediment ﬂuxes and spatial pattern
of sediment delivery to deep-water depocentres.

climatic and vegetational changes in river catchments, has been discussed widely. In the
upper Miocene EA Field in Nigeria, the main deltaic sand bodies are correlated with dry
intervals with monsoonal rains, recognised from the prevalence of savanna pollen, recurring
with a period of 100 kyr (Van der Zwan and Brugman, 1999). The impact of Milankovitch-
scale climatic variations on sediment supply is more likely to be recorded in transition
regions between two contrasting climatic zones. In transition regions, catchments may
experience cyclical variations of climatic conditions.
Van der Zwan (2002) tested the Milankovitch forcing of the sediment supply by rivers
in the Neogene (6.5 Ma to present) Niger sediment routing system using the forward mod-
elling package STRATAGEM. Since the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation, climatic

zones have shifted signiﬁcantly, for example from rainforest to savanna, with an apparent
Milankovitch frequency, which has caused a cyclicity in sediment supply to the delta
region. Their simulations suggest that in an icehouse world subjected to oscillating eustatic
base level, eustatic variations overwhelm the effect of climatic forcing of sediment release
from upland catchments. In a greenhouse world, however, Milankovitch-scale sediment
supply variations are expected to be more signiﬁcant in the absence of signiﬁcant sea level
variations. The packaging of alluvial stratigraphy in coastal plain settings may therefore
be at orbital frequencies as a result of climate-driven variations in sediment supply. For
example, a cyclicity of ∼100 kyr was identiﬁed in the Eocene Lower Montanyana Group
of the Tremp Basin, Spain (Marzo, Nijman, and Puigdefàbregas, 1988; Clevis, de Boer,
and Nijman, 2004b). Such frequencies may, however, also be generated by autocyclic
processes.
The 1-D transport-limited catchment-fan model (Armitage et al., 2011) can be expanded
to focus on how the system responds to repeated, cyclical change in climatic forcing, mani-
fested in variations in precipitation (Bar-Matthews et al., 2003; Ruddiman, 2006) and to test
if it is reasonable to expect the time-integrated clastic stratigraphic archive of sedimentary
systems to be a faithful recorder of high-frequency climate change. Simpson and Castelltort
(2012) used a physically based numerical model to show that sinusoidal variations in water
ﬂux in an upland catchment were linked to alternate periods of deposition of aggradational
sediment wedges and subsequent ﬂushing out, thereby causing a markedly episodic history
of sediment discharge from the catchment. In contrast, using a different set of boundary
conditions, Armitage et al. (2013) found that over time, a sinusoidal variation in climate,
expressed in terms of precipitation and run-off, is damped when measured in terms of
sediment discharge, rather than recorded or ampliﬁed. In other words, the Milankovitch
signal is ‘lost in translation’. They concluded that high-frequency climate variations in
the Milankovitch band are damped over time by the slow response time of the catchment
relative to the timescale of the forcing.
10.3 Analogue and Numerical Experiments of Sequence Architectures
The sequence stratigraphy method originated from the analysis of distinctive geometries
on seismic reﬂection proﬁles and was extended to outcrop and core data. It has, however,
been relatively slow to adopt new results from the ﬁeld of experimental stratigraphy using
analogue experiments and numerical forward modelling. Such experiments have allowed
the exploration of parameter space for external controls on stratigraphic architectures as
well as revealing the possibilities of autogenic behaviour (Muto, Steel, and Swenson, 2007;
Paola et al., 2009; Burgess and Prince, 2015).
Migration of moving boundaries, such as the shoreline, which generates a ‘shoreline
trajectory’, is a common feature of numerical models of stratigraphy under external forcing
from climate change and tectonics (Armitage et al., 2011; Hampson et al., 2014). Changes
in precipitation as a proxy for climate and in tectonic uplift/subsidence rate generate grain-
size trends and stratigraphic geometries that might be mistakenly attributed to changes

Sediment Routing Systems and Sequence Stratigraphy
in base (sea) level. Armitage et al. (2011), for example, used a simple sediment routing
system of a 10 km-long frontal catchment and an up to 20 km-long alluvial fan, separated
by a vertical normal fault. Tectonic uplift of the catchment, recorded as a slip rate on the
range-bounding fault, causes erosion, which results in the transport of sediment into the
hangingwall basin, as described in detail in Allen and Densmore (2000) and Densmore,
Allen, and Simpson (2007a) and in Section 8.5.3. Sediment transport is in the form of a
diffusive-concentrative equation (Smith and Bretherton, 1972)
∂h
∂t = −∂qs
∂x + U(x, t)
(10.1)
where h is the elevation at time t, x is the horizontal distance, qs is the unit width sediment
discharge, and U is the tectonic uplift rate within the catchment. The sediment ﬂux is split
into hillslope diffusion and ﬂuvial transport, assuming that ﬂuvial transport is proportional
to precipitation. The erosion therefore becomes
∂h
∂t = ∂
∂x

κ + c(ax)n
∂h
∂x + U(x, t)
(10.2)
where κ is the linear diffusivity, c is the non-linear sediment transport coefﬁcient (taken
as 1 × 10−6 m2 yr−1 (Simpson and Schlunegger, 2003)), α is the catchment-average
precipitation rate and n = 2 is the exponent that describes the dependency of sediment
discharge on ﬂuid transport. Equation (10.2) is made dimensionless by the length of the
catchment Lc and the diffusive timescale L2
c/κ, giving
h = Lc ¯h
(10.3)
x = Lc ¯x
(10.4)
t = L2
c

(10.5)
and equation (10.2) therefore becomes

∂¯t = ∂


1 + R¯x n
∂¯h
∂¯x + ¯U
(10.6)
where ¯U is the dimensionless uplift and R expresses the relative importance of concentrative
(ﬂuvial) processes versus diffusive (hillslope) processes
R = c(aLc)n
κ
(10.7)
The unit-width sediment ﬂux qs is sensitive to the boundary condition at the catchment
outlet. The absolute elevation of the depositional apex is free to move, but a continuity
of gradient between catchment and fan is imposed, as observed in natural catchment-fan
systems (Bull, 1964). The slope of the fan surface is assumed to be linear. Depositional
architecture is calculated using a volume balance, assuming that no erosion takes place

on the fan. The downstream ﬁning of mean grain size is calculated using the self-similar
solutions of Fedele and Paola (2007) and Duller et al. (2010).
The model can be applied to geological examples where the external forcing and grain-
size characteristics of the sediment supply can be constrained. The Fucino Basin of central
Italy is a recently drained lake containing ﬂuvio-deltaic deposits that prograded into the
basin from the faulted basin margin from the late Pliocene onwards (Cavinato et al., 2002).
The Fucino Fault experienced a ﬁve-fold increase in slip rate from 0.3 to 1.5 mm yr−1 at 800
ka (Whittaker, Attal, and Tucker, 2007), accompanied by an increase in both the median
(D50 = 11−50 mm) and coarse (D84 = 20−110 mm) grain-size percentiles exported
from a catchment (Gole di Cetano) in the footwall (Figure 10.10). The increase in the
median size of the sediment supply resulting from the ﬁve-fold increase in slip rate causes
a wedge of gravel to extend into the basin in the model. However, at the same time, the
larger D84/D50 ratio promotes rapid downstream ﬁning. As a result, the model output
in Figure 10.10 shows different vertical grain-size trends depending on location in the
basin. In proximal positions (marked A in Figure 10.10) the change in slip rate is marked
by an abrupt progradation and coarsening of grain size. In medial positions (marked B
in Figure 10.10) however, the same stratal surface is marked by a minor retrogradation
and ﬁning of grain size. In neither case does the sequence architecture reﬂect a change in
base level.
The shoreline trajectory in the Fucino Basin can also be simulated with a heavily param-
eterised, spatially lumped numerical model (PaCMoD) (Forzoni et al., 2014) using a high-
frequency sinusoidal climate (temperature and precipitation) signal and a low-frequency
background sinusoidal tectonic subsidence. The tectonic history, climate and grain-size
data of the adjacent Celano catchment were used to constrain model parameters. The results
are very similar to those obtained by the forward model of Armitage et al. (2011), with a
progradational lower unit, a rapid retrogradation of the shoreline at the base of an upper
unit, followed by a second progradational phase.
10.3.1 Autostratigraphy Resulting from Internal Dynamics
The sequence stratigraphic method was initially built on the expection that the lap-out
relationships of stratal packages were diagnostic of external forcing mechanisms and that
trends of shallowing and deepening were spatially consistent. Subsequently, it has been
argued that sequence stratigraphic boundaries are not diagnostic of unique forcing mech-
anisms (Cantuneanu and Zecchin, 2016). The numerical model outlined previously shows
that the landscape response, in terms of stratigraphic architectures and grain-size trends,
to tectonic and climatic perturbations may be complex and non-linear. If natural systems
behave similarly, it may be difﬁcult to deconvolve the various effects of tectonics, climate,
sea level change and unforced internal dynamics uniquely from the stratigraphic record
(Burgess and Prince, 2015).
The movement of the shoreline in conventional sequence stratigraphic thinking is
explainable with reference to the ratio of the accommodation generated A compared to the

laboratory experiments of the growth of a delta (Muto et al., 2007). The fundamental
control on the migration of the shoreline is that the foreset of the delta must lengthen over
time, since there is a ﬁnite basin slope, causing a change in the partitioning of sediment
from topset to foreset.
In many sedimentary systems, there is a non-linear response to steady external
forcing, which arises from internal feedbacks between sediment transport processes. In
the autostratigraphy method, movement of the shoreline, deﬁning trends in the position
of coastal onlap (Vail et al., 1977) and the shoreline trajectory (Helland-Hansen and
Hampson, 2009; Henriksen et al., 2011) (Section 8.1), reﬂects the non-equilibrium response
of the ﬂuvio-deltaic system to steady external forcing. The ﬂuvio-deltaic system has three
moving boundaries - the shoreline, the delta toe and the alluvium-basement transition
(Figure 10.11), which are deﬁned by the slopes β, γ and φ. The impact of autogenic
processes compared to steady external forcing depends on the timescale of the ﬂuctuations
in external forcing T relative to the timescale τ of the the non-equilibrium response. Since
sediment transport is in broad terms driven by slope, the autogenic timescale can be treated
as determined by an effective diffusivity κe that encompasses the efﬁciency of various
transport processes.
We ﬁrstly change the notation for the sediment supply to be consistent with elsewhere in
this book, that is, S ≡Qs. If the sediment supply is steady (Qs constant) and the rise or fall
of relative sea level is also steady (A constant), the ﬂuvio-deltaic system has a characteristic
length scale given by
L = Qs

Sediment Routing Systems and Sequence Stratigraphy
If we further assume that the morphodynamics of the river system supplying sediment to
the delta sets the overall timescale of the system, then κe becomes the ﬂuvial diffusivity
(Paola, Heller, and Angevine, 1992; Paola, 2000) and the term Qs/κe is the characteristic
slope α of the alluvial surface, so that
τ = L2

(10.10)
Low-gradient, small alluvial systems are therefore far more sensitive to autogenic responses
than high-gradient, large systems (Muto, Steel, and Swenson, 2007).
Early sequence stratigraphy models held that the alluvial slope was in a state of ‘grade’
(Mackin, 1948), simply bypassing sediment to the shoreline along its entire length, and
aggraded at times of relative sea level rise and degraded at times of relative sea level
fall (Wilgus et al., 1988). In the non-equilibrium behaviour of autostratigraphy, however,
alluvial rivers may attain grade and, in principle, be aggradational not only during rising
sea level and at highstand, but also throughout falling sea level (Muto and Swenson, 2006).
For the alluvial river to be in a sustained state of ‘grade’ depends primarily on the alluvial
and basal slopes (α, φ).
With a steady rise in relative sea level, experiments show that there is an early stage
of basinward migration of the shoreline, but this trend is reversed some time after the
beginning of delta progradation, a phenomenon known as autoretreat. Autoretreat is caused
by the progressive increase in storage capacity of the entire ﬂuvio-deltaic system as relative
sea level rises. Later still, there is a change in the ﬂuvio-deltaic system, known as an
autobreak, when the clear delta front conﬁguration is lost (Figure 10.12). Autobreak occurs

when there is further growth of the surface area of the delta so that sediment supply is
entirely consumed in building the subaerial coastal plain. If β ≥γ and T >> τ, both
autoretreat and autobreak are inevitable. However, if β < γ , autobreak is not reached
because any progressive increase in the surface area of the foreset is fully compensated by
a progressive decrease in the surface area of the alluvial system.
Depending on the values of geometrical parameters for the receiving basin (γ , φ) and the
river-fed delta (α, β), there are therefore potentially very different stratigraphic responses to
the same external driver. Stratigraphic correlation between adjacent or distant ﬂuvio-deltaic
systems is hazardous without some understanding of the impact of internal autocyclic pro-
cesses. Failure to deconvolve autogenic effects from external forcing would, for example,
result in the construction of an erroneous sea level curve representing the external eustatic
forcing.
Finally, any coastal depositional system evolving under the control of sea level has
characteristic length and timescales for the manifestation of large-scale autogenic events
(Muto, Steel, and Swenson, 2007). The characteristic autostratigraphic timescale τa and
the characteristic autostratigraphic length scale a are given by

(10.11)
and
τa = 2
κ

κ
Qs
| ˙E|
(10.12)
where | ˙E| is the absolute speed of eustatic sea level change, Qs is the sediment discharge
([L]3[T]−1), and κ is a linear diffusivity parameter for alluvial sedimentation with dimen-
sions [L]2[T]−1. Taking a value of the sediment discharge appropriate for a large river
(Qs = 1,000 Mt yr−1), the characteristic autostratigraphic length scale ranges from 60 km
for a sea level speed of 0.1 mm yr−1 to 6 km for a speed of sea level change of 10 mm
yr−1. The diffusivity for sand in alluvial basins is of order 105 m2 yr−1 (Marr et al., 2000).
Using this value of diffusivity, the characteristic autostratigraphic timescale ranges from
36 kyr to 364 yr for the large river with the same range of sea level change | ˙E| = 0.1 −10
mm yr−1. For a small river, let Qs = 10 Mt yr−1. Following the same procedure, τa ranges
between ∼364−4 yr, showing that the response is almost instantaneous. Nevertheless, the
characteristic response time varies by two orders of magnitude between the large- and the
small-sediment discharge rivers. Two adjacent sediment routing systems whose coastal
zones are fed by rivers of contrasting discharge may therefore show a nonequilibrium
response to the same sea level rise differently, with different time lags, depending on the
magnitudes of Qs and κ.
Correlation of sequence architectures generated by diagnostic forcing mechanisms may
therefore work only in restricted situations, for example where the timescale of the external
ﬂuctuations is very short relative to the timescale of the non-equilibrium response to steady
forcing (that is, T << τ). For the glacio-eustatic climate changes of the Quaternary,

Sediment Routing Systems and Sequence Stratigraphy
T ∼100 kyr, corresponding to the ‘rapid forcing’ of Marr et al. (2000) and the ‘reactive’
landscape dynamics of Allen (2008b). Under fast forcing, eustatic effects are likely to
dominate the stratigraphic response, which explains why the Quaternary record contains
strong evidence for glacio-eustatic cycles. On the other hand, if the ﬂuctuation of the
external control is slow compared to the timescale of the non-equilibrium response, that
is, T ≥τ, we have the case of ‘slow forcing’ of Marr et al. (2000) or the ‘buffered’
landscape dynamics of Allen (2008b). In this case, sequence architectures are unlikely to be
attributable to particular external driving mechanisms and autogenic processes need to be
considered. The sequence stratigraphy methodology and the process stratigraphy derived
from theory, physical experiments and numerical models therefore have complementary
relationships (Muto et al., 2007).
10.4 Cycles and the Global Sea Level Chart
Bearing in mind the central importance of sea level change in the original formulation
of the sequence stratigraphy model, it is particularly instructive to understand the natural
variation of sea level in the past. These sea level variations occur at a very wide variety of
temporal scales. At short timescales below the range of interest for sequence architectures
(Agnew, 1992), they can be attributed principally to waves and tides, and vary more or
less continuously up to longer periods of greater geological interest (200 Myr) (Harrison,
1988). Long period variations in relative sea level come from studies of continental ﬂooding
(Bond, 1979; Harrison et al., 1981) where the driving mechanisms are variations in the
volume of the ocean basins, losses of ocean water by subduction, and vertical movements of
the continental surface, which may be caused by dynamic effects originating in the mantle
(Lithgow-Bertelloni and Gurnis, 1997; Gurnis, 2001). Medium-scale period variations are
revealed from oxygen isotope data as a proxy for sea level change over the last ca. 1
Myr, in which Milankovitch band peaks can be discriminated, especially that at 98 kyr
(Imbrie et al., 1984; Muller and MacDonald, 1997). This timescale of sea level ﬂuctuation
is attributed to orbital variations driving global climate change.
10.4.1 An Ordered Hierarchy?
The global cycle chart of Haq, Hardenbol, and Vail (1987) gives a record of relative sea
level extending back to nearly 600 Ma in which hierarchical orders overlap in their range
of duration. Since publication in 1987, this overlap has not narrowed as more data have been
collated (Williams, 1988; Van Wagoner et al., 1990; Carter et al., 1991; Vail et al., 1991;
Reid and Dorobek, 1993; Duval, Cramez, and Vail, 1998; Lehrmann and Goldhammer,
1999; Schlager, 2004; Catuneanu, 2006), raising questions about whether the hierarchical
levels are real. A sampling of the ‘global’ sea level curve at a frequency of 0.1 Myr gives
a power spectrum that is indistinguishable from sources at higher and lower frequencies.
That is, the global cycle chart itself suggests scale invariance for relative sea level. Indeed,
Wolfgang Schlager stated (Schlager, 2010) (p.149) that
.011
15:11:26

10.4 Cycles and the Global Sea Level Chart
357
the orders of sequence cycles are simply subdivisions of convenience in a stratigraphic continuum.
The vision of some authors is to establish a global cycle chart of sea level change
that will serve as a chronometer of Earth history. Peter Vail and colleagues wrote in Vail,
Mitchum, and Thompson (1977) (p.96):
One of the greatest potential applications of the global cycle chart is its use as an instrument of
geochronology.
The global cycle chart derives estimates of global sea level history from the amount of
coastal onlap on seismic reﬂection proﬁles (Vail, Mitchum, and Thompson, 1977; Haq,
Hardenbol, and Vail, 1987; Haq, 1991; Haq and Schutter, 2008). Such global cycle charts
have, however, attracted widespread criticism. They require high levels of precision in the
dating of stratigraphic surfaces in order to act as a global standard, and the complexity of
interacting processes has been under-appreciated in the zeal for recognising global controls.
The widely used global chart of Haq, Hardenbol, and Vail (1987) and its derivatives
apparently reveal an ordered hierarchy of stratigraphic cycles, from ﬁrst order cycles at
timescales of 100 Myr, second order at 5–15 Myr, and third order at 1–10 Myr. As recently
as 2008, Haq and Schutter (2008) (p.65) wrote that
The stratigraphic record is a composite of several orders of superimposed sedimentary cycles . . .
A hierarchical framework is based on the ﬁlling of accommodation at varying magni-
tudes and duration, giving in ascending order, parasequences, system tracts, depositional
sequences, sequence sets, composite sequences, composite sequence sets and megase-
quences (Neal and Abreu, 2009). These hierarchical units are stacked into progradational,
aggradational and retrogradation patterns, and are described as self-similar (Neal and
Abreu, 2009) (p.782) and not associated with particular ranges of duration or amplitude.
The idea of an ordered hierarchy contradicts the view that sea level change is fractal
(Harrison et al., 1981; Hsui, Rust, and Klein, 1993) and omits to recognise the possibility
that some stratigraphic cycles may be due to unforced internal dynamics (Muto, Steel, and
Swenson, 2007). The overlapping time ranges for 1st to 6th order cycles (Schlager,
2004)(p.185, ﬁg.1) (Figure 10.13), casts doubt as to whether hierarchical order can
be uniquely discriminated. In particular, some workers advocate an abandonment of
the distinction between 2nd and 3rd orders (Hardenbol et al., 1998). In addition, the
belief that depositional sequences (3rd order) are bounded by unconformities created
by emergence, whereas parasequences (4th order and higher) are bounded by ﬂooding
surfaces (Van Wagoner et al., 1990) is not supported, especially in carbonate environments
(Schlager, 2004). The ordered hierarchy of cycles may therefore be an illusion.
The critical aspect of the recognition of global cycles of sea level change through-
out the Phanerozoic is the ability and accuracy of dating and correlation of stratigraphic
events (Miall, 1994). In the Phanerozoic, biostratigraphic subdivisions require a calibra-
tion scale derived from radiometric dating, supplemented by chemostratigraphy and mag-
netostratigraphy. The various techniques and their uses in establishing an international
chronostratigraphic chart (www.stratigraphy.org) are dealt with at length by Miall (2016).

So-called third-order cycles (depositional sequences), the fundamental unit for global
correlation, are particularly problematical. It is clear that age assignments of sequence

half million years in the chart given by Haq, Hardenbol, and Vail (1987), to the nearest
0.1 Myr in the Palaeozoic curve given by Haq and Schutter (2008) and in millions of years
to two decimal places in some in-house industry schemes (e.g. British Petroleum), yet
chronological resolution is commonly no better than ±1 Myr (Hinnov and Ogg, 2007). As
Ricken (1991) (p.773) has observed,
The range of error is often larger than the actual [cycle] time span considered.
To test whether the cycles of sea level illustrated in the global cycle chart form an
ordered hierarchy, the duration of sequences (so-called 3rd order), supersequences (2nd
order) and supersequence sets and megacycles (1st order) were read directly from the chart
provided by Haq, Hardenbol, and Vail (1987), since this was the key publication from
which alternative charts were inspired. The durations of sequence stratigraphic cycles are
expressed in a log-log plot of the number of cycles of duration greater than T versus the
duration T. This was performed for each order of cycle and then for the combination of
all cycles. The null hypothesis is that the distribution of cycle durations for each order is
normally distributed with a mean μ and standard deviation σ derived from inspection of
the global cycle chart (Figure 10.14). In other words, if a certain cycle duration is known,
it should be possible to say what the probability is that the cycle is ﬁrst, second, third
or higher in order. Failure of the null hypothesis would imply that the cycles drawn by
Haq, Hardenbol, and Vail (1987) and its derivatives do not justify the idea of an ordered
hierarchy.
The most straightforward expectation for an ordered hierarchy of cycles is that each
order has cycle durations that are normally distributed about the mean. The probability
density function for a normal distribution is
f(T, μ, σ) =
1
σ
√
2π
e
−(x−μ)2
2σ2
(10.13)
The number of cycles expected with a given duration is then the product of the total
number of cycles and the probability function, which can be converted into a curve of
number of cycles exceeding T in duration versus T. This procedure is carried out for each
‘order’, and then three normal distributions are combined for timescales of up to 80 Myr
using the following data (Figure 10.13b):
Third order: μ = 3 Myr; σ = 1 Myr
Second order: μ = 7 Myr; σ = 3 Myr
First order: μ = 50 Myr; σ = 10 Myr
The cumulative probability distribution for data forming a normal distribution is:

(10.15)
where x1 and x2 are the upper and lower limits of the bin. This can be compared with
the probability of the observed distribution. For example, the probability of a cycle length
being between 1.5 and 2.0 Myr if the cycle lengths are normally distributed with a mean of
3 Myr and a standard deviation of 1 Myr is 0.092. The probability of a cycle length being
between 2.5 and 3.0 Myr is 0.191.
A compilation of 120 third-order cycles from the global cycle chart of Haq, Hardenbol,
and Vail (1987) (Figure 10.14) shows that the best ﬁt is a power law. The trend expected
from a normal distribution is strongly different to the trend observed. By extending the
sampling to second-order and ﬁrst-order cycles in the global cycle chart, a similar picture
emerges (n = 158). The data are better explained by a power law than by a model of three
distinct normal distributions (Figure 10.13b). Substitution of the Haq, Hardenbol, and Vail
(1987) data with cycle data derived from the Cenozoic and Mesozoic of the Arabian plate
(Sharland et al., 2001, 2004) and with the same data recalibrated by the Global Time Scale
(2004) by Haq and Al-Qahtani (2005) shows little difference.
The global curve for the Palaeozoic (542−251 Ma) of Haq and Schutter (2008) contains
172 third order cycles with an average duration of 1.7 Myr. Remarkably, cycle durations
of as little as 0.4 Myr are proposed, and there are 35 cycles of less than 1 Myr duration.
Since current estimates of the uncertainty of the geological timescale are ±1 Myr for the
Pennsylvanian-Permian, and ±2−3 Myr for the remainder of the Palaeozoic (Hinnov and
Ogg, 2007), the implied precision of the curve of Haq and Schutter (2008) is inexplicable.
If we group all cycles of duration less than 2 Myr together, the log-log plot of number of
cycles exceeding duration T versus T gives a power law ﬁt rather than indicating a normal
distribution centred on 1.7 Myr.
Cycle durations from less than 1 Myr to as much as 100 Myr are therefore best explained
by a power law (Figures 10.14 and 10.15), suggesting that stratigraphic cycles, and the gaps
that separate them, are essentially fractal (Schlager, 2004). Curves very similar to those put
forward as representing the history of global sea level can be generated by a random walk
(Harrison, 2002). This does not mean that stratigraphic prediction is impossible, but does
suggest that the presence of cycles of duration greater than 1 Myr is fundamentally an
outcome of a complexly interacting and self-organised system.
I conclude that there is no ordered hierarchy of cycle duration in the existing global sea
level charts. This being the case, the search for driving mechanisms with a time-behaviour
concordant with cycle repeat times is a futile exercise, since cycles occur at all durations.
The subdivision of the stratigraphic record into a hierarchical order of cycles may be simply
a result of perception (Drummond and Wilkinson, 1996). Sequence variability is more like
statistical noise (Hergarten, 2002) than occurring at speciﬁed time and spatial scales in
response to well-ordered, oscillating drivers.

Stratal stacking patterns may not display clear cyclicity (Helland-Hansen and Hampson,
2009), and qualitative methods may not in any case be able to provide strong evidence
of cyclicity (Wilkinson et al., 1997; Burgess, 2016). By comparing the expected upward
transitions between facies, based only on their relative abundance, against the observed
upward transitions, allows a Markov statistic to be calculated that describes the degree of
order in a stratigraphic succession (Burgess, 2016). A ‘runs order metric’ also discriminates
between ordered and disordered arrangements of facies thickness. None of the stratigraphic

successions studied by Burgess (2016) showed evidence of order at the bed by bed scale,
though there was some evidence for order at longer length and timescales. Ordered facies
successions and thickness trends may be much less common than typically assumed.
There are therefore strong reservations about the chronological precision and global
correlation of Phanerozoic sequence stratigraphic boundaries. Four aspects stand out. First,
outside of the Quaternary, the ‘global’ cycle chart as presently formulated cannot be shown
to be correct or otherwise, since many of the cycles proposed are shorter than the best
available chronological resolution. The Phanerozoic ‘global’ cycle chart might therefore
be regarded as plausible yet untestable. Second, the ‘global’ cycle chart, irrespective
of chronological resolution, might be regarded as fundamentally ﬂawed and internally
inconsistent since its component cycles fail to represent an ordered hierarchy. Third,
since sequence boundaries and ﬂooding surfaces are likely to be variably diachronous
with respect to a synchronous perturbation such as base level change, the search for
global synchrony is fundamentally futile outside of those parts of the geological past
dominated by high-amplitude, high-frequency glacio-eustatic change. Fourth, the order of
stratigraphic successions, which forms the basis for recognising trends in facies and stratal
thickness made use of in building sequence stratigraphic models, may be difﬁcult to justify
quantitatively.
