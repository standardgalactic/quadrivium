About the Author
After physically destroying three typewriters, Dan Gookin bought his first
computer in 1982 at the urging of the guy in the typewriter repair shop.
Contrary to his prejudices, Dan quickly discovered that computers were
about more than math, and he quickly took to the quirky little devices.
Twenty-five years later, Mr. Gookin has written over 100 books about comput-
ers and high tech and gone through more than 50 computers, including a
dozen or so laptops and portables. He has achieved fame as one of the first
computer radio talk show hosts, the editor of a magazine, a national technol-
ogy spokesman, and an occasional actor on the community theater stage.
Dan still considers himself a writer and computer “guru” whose job it is to
remind everyone that computers are not to be taken too seriously. His
approach to computers is light and humorous, yet very informative. He
knows that the complex beasts are important and can do a great deal to help
people become productive and successful. Dan mixes his vast knowledge of
computers with a unique, dry sense of humor that keeps everyone informed —
and awake. His favorite quote is “Computers are a notoriously dull subject,
but that doesn’t mean I have to write about them that way.”
Dan Gookin’s most recent books are PCs For Dummies, 10th Edition, Laptops
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, and some new titles he can’t yet discuss under
threat of death. He holds a degree in communications/visual arts from UCSD.
Dan dwells in North Idaho, where he enjoys woodworking, music, theater,
riding his bicycle, and spending time with the lads.

Introduction
A
re you nervous? Intimidated? Befuddled and confused beyond all
recourse? What did they do to Word? Just when you thought you finally
had a leg up on the program, just as you finally remembered that the Sort
command is on the Tables menu, they’ve gone and changed . . . everything!
What a headache!
Welcome to Word 2007 For Dummies, which is a better solution to your word
processing pains than taking two aspirin and calling tech support in the
morning. This book is your friendly, informative, and entertaining guide to
the newfangled way of processing words that is Word 2007.
I’m not telling you that this book will make you all cozy and pleased with the
new ways of Word. No, I’m merely promising that this book eases the pain
everyone feels with Word 2007. Let other authors apologize for the program!
I’m here to kick Word in the butt and, hopefully, you’ll enjoy watching that.
What’s New in Word 2007?
Earlier versions of Word all looked alike. They had menus, toolbars, task
panes, and other pop-up, drop-down, leak-out nonsense. With Word 2007, all
that stuff is gone, nailed shut in a box and wheeled away into that huge ware-
house where the U.S. government keeps the Ark of the Covenant. Word 2007
sports no menus. It has only one tiny toolbar.
Replacing the menus and toolbars is a tabbed Ribbon system. The tabs are
like the menus of old, but their commands are grouped into graphical com-
mand buttons. Some buttons are commands, some buttons are menus. This
setup can be overwhelming at first, but I must admit that it makes it possible
to do some tasks in fewer steps than with the old Word interface. Knowing
that, of course, doesn’t make the thing less intimidating.
Beyond the interface, Word is a bit stricter on styles and formatting. The ben-
efit here is instant previews, or the ability to instantly see how changes affect
your document as you browse a menu. Part III of this book explains more.
Word’s main mode of operation is Print Layout view. If you were a fan of
Normal or Draft view in previous versions of Word, I highly recommend that
you switch to Print Layout view, if you haven’t already.

Finally, many commands didn’t survive the transition from older versions of
Word to Word 2007. You won’t find any of the following in Word 2007:
AutoFormat
Save All
Close All
Save As Web Page
Character Animation
Speech
File Search
Wizards
Frames
WordPerfect Help
Office Assistant
These items were either dropped entirely or replaced with something better.
About This Book
I don’t intend for you to read this book from cover to cover. It’s not a novel,
and if it were, it would be a musical novel and you’d be required to sing the
songs and go through the dances with all the characters in a book and, quite
honestly, I don’t think that the people near you would let you get away with it.
This book is a reference. Each chapter covers a specific topic or task that
Word does. Within a chapter, you find self-contained sections, each of which
describes how to perform a specific task or get something done. Sample sec-
tions you encounter in this book include:
 Saving your stuff
 Moving a block of text
 Quickly finding your place
 Aligning paragraphs
 Cobbling a table together quickly
 Creating a table of contents
 Adding topics to your outline
There are no keys to memorize, no secret codes, no tricks, no videos to sleep
through, and no wall charts. Instead, each section explains a topic as though
it’s the first thing you read in this book. Nothing is assumed, and everything
is cross-referenced. Technical terms and topics, when they come up, are
neatly shoved to the side, where you can easily avoid reading them. The idea
here isn’t for you to learn anything. This book’s philosophy is to help you
look it up, figure it out, and get back to work.
2
Word 2007 For Dummies 

How to Use This Book
You hold in your hands an active book. The topics between this book’s
yellow-and-black covers are all geared toward getting things done in Word
2007. Because nothing is assumed, all you need to do is find the topic that
interests you and read.
Word uses the mouse and keyboard to get things done. Still, the program
looks different from traditional Windows programs, so pay attention!
This is a keyboard shortcut:
Ctrl+P
This shortcut means that you should press and hold the Ctrl (control) key
and type a P, just as you would press Shift+P to get a capital P. Sometimes,
more than two keys need to be pressed at the same time:
Ctrl+Shift+T
In this line, you press Ctrl and Shift together and then press the T key.
Release all three keys.
Commands in Word 2007 exist as command buttons on the Ribbon interface.
This book may refer to the tab, the command group, and then the button
itself to help you locate that command button — for example, the Page
Layout tab, Page Background group, Page Color button. Or, I might say “the
Page Color button found in the Page Layout tab’s Page Background group.
Often times, command buttons are shown in the margin, which can help you
locate them.
Menu commands are listed like this:
Table➪Insert Table
This command means that you choose the command named Insert Table
from the Table menu. Note that Table is most likely a button on the Ribbon.
The File menu from previous versions of Word now exists as the Microsoft
Office Button menu, which I refer to as the Office Button menu. You still press
Alt+F to access this menu, and it contains items similar to the old File menu.

Introduction

When I describe a message or something you see on-screen, it looks like this:
Why should I bother to learn about compound interest when
robots will eventually destroy the human race?
If you need further help operating your computer or a good general reference,
I can recommend my book PCs For Dummies, published by Wiley Publishing,
Inc. The book contains lots of useful information to supplement what you find
in this book.
Foolish Assumptions
Though this book was written with the beginner in mind, I still make a
few assumptions. Foremost, I assume that you’re using a computer. You
use Windows as the computer’s operating system, either Windows Vista
or Windows XP or any other version of Windows that can run Word 2007.
There are no specific issues between Word and Windows as far as this book
is concerned, but keep in mind that this book isn’t about Windows.
Your word processor is Microsoft Word 2007. It is not Microsoft Works. It is
not an earlier version of Word. It is not WordPerfect. It is not a version of
Word that runs on a Macintosh.
Throughout this book, I use “Word 2007” and “Word” interchangeably. Both
refer to the same thing. (Word 2007 may also be referred to as Word 12 in
some instances, although not in this book.)
Word 2007 is a part of the Microsoft Office 2007 suite of programs. This book
doesn’t cover any other part of Microsoft Office, nor do I assume that you
even have the Microsoft Office suite installed.
How This Book Is Organized
This book contains six major parts, each of which is divided into several chap-
ters. The chapters themselves have been sliced into smaller, modular sections.
You can pick up the book and read any section without necessarily knowing
what has already been covered in the rest of the book. Start anywhere.
Here’s a breakdown of the parts and what you can find in them:
4
Word 2007 For Dummies 

Part I: Hello, Word!
This part provides a quick introduction to Word and word processing.
Information is offered on how best to use your keyboard, plus a simple
overview of the typical word processing day. Part I contains lots of good,
basic information.
Part II: Word Processing Basics
The chapters in this part of the book cover the 7 basic tasks of any word
processor: moving around a document, editing text, search and replace,
working with blocks of text, document proofing, saving and opening, and
finally printing.
Part III: Formatting
This part deals with formatting, from the smallest iota of text to formatting
commands that span an entire document and more. Formatting is the art of
making your document look less ugly.
Part IV: Making Your Document 
All Fancy-Schmancy
This part is formatting dessert, or things you can do beyond regular format-
ting to help make your document look like more than a typical, boring docu-
ment. It covers lines, borders, tables, columns, lists, graphical goodness, and
all sorts of stuff that makes Word more than a typical word processor.
Part V: What Else Is Left?
This part covers a few dangling details that I consider myself fortunate to
write about, such as outlining, collaboration, mail merge, label-making, and
other interesting things that Word does.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The traditional last part of any For Dummies book contains chapters with lists
of ten items. You’ll find lots of helpful stuff here, some weird things you may
not know about, plus even more useful tips, tricks, and good suggestions.

Introduction

What’s Not Here
Word is one heck of a program. Covering the entire thing would take a book
several thousand pages long. (I kid you not.) My approach in this book is to
cover as much basic word processing as possible. Because of that, some
advanced features did get pushed off the table of contents.
You won’t find any information here on macros in Word. Although they can be
useful, it’s tough to get into macros without broaching the more technical topic
of Microsoft Office Visual Basic, which is a true programming language —
definitely not beginner stuff.
Some of the more esoteric features are touched upon lightly here. For exam-
ple, I could spend about 70 pages detailing what can be done with graphics in
Word, but I limited myself to only a dozen pages.
Finally, this book doesn’t cover using Word to do anything on the Internet.
That includes using e-mail, making a Web page, blogging, online publishing,
creating forms, or doing that kind of stuff. This is a word processing book,
and Word is a word processor.

Where to Go from Here
Start reading! Observe the table of contents and find something that interests
you. Or, look up your puzzle in the index.
Because Word 2007 has changed, whether you’re new to the program or not,
you should start reading at Chapter 1.
Read! Write! Let your brilliance shine on a sheet of paper.
My e-mail address is dgookin@wambooli.com. Yes, that’s my real address. I
try to reply to all the e-mail I get, although sometimes I’m not that speedy.
And, although I enjoy saying “Hi” or answering questions about this book,
please do not e-mail me with technical support questions or problems with
your computer. For that, I can recommend reading my book Troubleshooting
Your PC For Dummies (Wiley).

Hello, Word!

lame it all on Homer. One day, he was telling his
epic poem The Iliad to a crowd of eager Greeks.
The Greeks were thrilled. One Greek in particular was
so enamored with the tale that he blurted out, “This
stuff is great! If only we could remember it all!”
Irritated at being interrupted, Homer replied, “Why not
write it down?”
The Greeks collectively went “Huh?”
Homer explained, “Me? I’m blind. I had to memorize the
whole thing. You — you have sight. You can write it down.
Of course, it would be nifty if you had a word processor,
which would make typing the thing easy, as well as format-
ting and printing it. But you’re thousands of years too early
for that. So my advice is to start by creating an alphabet.
Better still, you’re Greeks: Steal an alphabet.”
And so the long quest began. From the Greek alphabet
to reading and writing for the masses to moveable type to
the fountain pen and the typewriter, and now . . . this, this
word processor, which I introduce to you in the chapters
that comprise this part of the book.

heer up! Word processing is one of the best things that a computer can do.
It’s much better than trying to compose your thoughts on a typewriter. It’s
better than worrying about good penmanship. It’s much more efficient than
using Gutenberg’s moveable-type machine. It’s cheaper than paying a scribe to
scribble hieroglyphics on a papyrus roll. And it’s certainly better than chipping
a stone tablet with a rock. Keep that rock handy, though: You may still need
something to smash the computer when it frustrates you.
This chapter provides an overview of Microsoft Word 2007. It’s your introduc-
tion to the newfangled way that people are word processing during this, the
breakfast of the 21st century. So, sit back, relax, grab a refreshing beverage,
and definitely put down that rock! You’ll be on your way to writing words
electric in no time.
How Do I Start Word? Let Me
Count the Ways. . . .
Anyone using a computer suspects that there’s probably a better, faster, or
more serious way to get things done. There are so many options! Who knows
when someone will amble up to you and point at how you start your word
processor. “You do that?” they’ll snicker and walk away. Oh, no. What now?
The question isn’t really how to start Word, but rather how best to start Word.
In Windows, there are a bazillion ways to start any program. Other books drag
out every last method, but for starting Word (or any program that you use

often), there are definitely good, better, and best ways. Before going there,
consider taking some general steps before you begin your word processing
odyssey:
1. Ensure that your computer is on and toasty.
Any computer that’s on is, in fact, toasty. The only way to make it
toastier is to insert bread, which I don’t recommend.
2. Prepare yourself physically.
Make sure you’re seated, with a nice, upright, firm posture. They tell me
that your wrists should be even with your elbows and that you shouldn’t
have to tilt your head forward. Shoulders are back and relaxed.
Close your eyes. Unwind. Breathe in, breath out.
3. Prepare yourself mentally.
Yes, you can do this! Hail the muse scribborrhea, the forest nymph of
electronics and typing. Think calm thoughts. Concentrate on letting the
thoughts flow from your brain and rush down your arms and into your
fingers as they dance upon the keyboard. Remember that you are the
master. Mutter that over and over: “I am the master. . . .”
If you need help starting your computer, refer to my book PCs For Dummies
(Wiley Publishing) for quick and accurate turning-on-the-computer instructions.
You can stop muttering “I am the master” now.
The good, yet unimaginative,
way to start Word
Without fail, the place to start any program in Windows is at the fabled Start
button. It may not be the coolest way to start a program, but it’s consistent
and reliable — good things to have in a computer. Obey these steps:
1. Click the Start button.
Use your computer mouse to click the Start button, which is often found
on the left side of the taskbar, at the bottom of the screen, adorned with
the Windows logo and often (cleverly) the word Start.
Clicking the Start button displays the Start menu.
2. Choose Word from the All Programs menu.
Now, you may be lucky and see the Word program icon on the Start
menu. If so, click the Word icon to start Word. If not, you have to click the
All Programs menu and look for Word in that vast labyrinth.
12
Part I: Hello, Word! 

Behold! Word starts! Watch in amazement as your computer whizzes and
whirs. Before too long, Word appears on the computer’s monitor, trying to be
friendly and inviting but failing utterly.
Don’t let Word’s appearance overwhelm you! I describe what you’re looking
at later, in the section “Behold Word!”
 If you can’t find Word on the All Programs menu, look for a submenu
named Microsoft Office or Office 12 or even Office 2007. Word may be
lurking on that submenu.
 The Start menu contains a list of many interesting things, including pro-
grams, recently used programs, and fun locations to visit in Windows.
One of those Start menu things is the All Programs menu, which may
also be called Programs (without the word All).
 Supposedly, every program ever installed on your computer has
installed its icon in a spot somewhere on the All Programs menu.
 I refer to the program as Word, though the icon may be labeled Microsoft
Word, Microsoft Office Word, Word 2007, or some other clever variation
on that theme.
The better and best ways to start Word
When you use Word a lot, it helps to have quick access to its icon — that icon
is the way you start Word — and then start your work. A better way than
keeping Word hidden on the All Programs menu is to create a Word shortcut
icon on the desktop. Heed these steps:
1. Locate the Word icon on the All Programs menu.
Don’t start Word now! Just point the mouse at the Word icon on the Start
button’s All Programs menu or wherever else it may be found.
13
Chapter 1: Word Hokey-Pokey
Automatically starting Word every 
ding-dong time you start Windows
To get your computer to start Word whenever you
start Windows, you need to move the Microsoft
Word item from its current location on the All
Programs menu to the All Programs➪Startup
folder. The items in the Startup folder start up auto-
matically when Windows begins its day. As with
all things in Windows, there exists a multitude of
ways to accomplish the move. Refer to your
favorite Windows reference for the details, or just
grab someone who looks like a Windows nerd and
have them perform the task for you. Suggestion:
Bribe them with something salty and crunchy.

2. Right-click the Microsoft Word menu item.
A pop-up menu appears.
3. Choose Send To➪Desktop (Create Shortcut).
Whew! The scary part is over. You haven’t changed anything, but you
have added a new icon to the desktop, an icon you can use to start
Word, if you like. To prove it:
4. Click the mouse on the desktop.
The desktop is the background you see when you use Windows. Clicking
the desktop hides the Start menu.
5. Locate the Microsoft Word shortcut icon.
It looks like the icon shown in the margin. That’s your shortcut to Word.
You can now use that icon to start Word: Just double-click, and you “open”
the program. Then you can start clack-clack-clacking away at the keyboard.
That’s faster than using the All Programs menu.
The best way to start Word, and the way I do it every day, is to place the Word
icon on the Quick Launch Toolbar.
The Quick Launch Toolbar, found right next to the Start button on the taskbar,
is a row of icons representing programs, which you can start with a single click
of the mouse. And, unlike the desktop, the Quick Launch bar is always handy.
To put the Word icon on the Quick Launch bar, you need to drag and drop, so
it helps to have a Word icon already on the desktop, as described in the pre-
ceding set of steps. From the desktop, use the mouse to drag the Word icon
to the Quick Launch bar, and then release the mouse button to “drop” the
icon, as shown in Figure 1-1.
Starting Word from the Quick Launch bar is the best way to go: Just point the
mouse at the Word icon and click, and Word is summoned to the screen.
 The Quick Launch Toolbar may not be visible on your computer. Refer
to my book PCs For Dummies for more information or if the Quick
Launch bar is too narrow and you cannot see the Word icon.
 Another way to have the Word icon always handy is to pin it to the Start
menu directly. In Step 3 (a few paragraphs back), choose the item named
Pin to Start Menu.
 Making these multiple copies of the Word icon does not consume extra
hard drive space. You’re merely copying shortcuts to the Word program,
not copies of the entire program itself.

Part I: Hello, Word! 

Starting Word by opening a document
Word is a computer program. You use that program to create documents,
which are stored on your computer in much the same way as people pile junk
into boxes and store them in their garages. But that’s not important. What is
important is that you can use those documents to start Word: Opening a Word
document causes Word to start and to display that document for editing,
printing, or just giving others the impression that you’re doing something.
Here’s one way you can start Word by opening a document:
1. Open the Documents folder.
The Documents folder, also called My Documents in some versions of
Windows, is where Word, as well as other applications, stores the stuff
you create. You can find this folder on the desktop, or you can get at it
from the Start menu.
The Documents folder opens and displays its content, which is the stuff
you’ve already created and saved to disk.
2. Locate a Word document.
A Word document appears, as shown in the margin.
3. Double-click the Word document icon.
Word starts and loads the document for editing, reading, modifying,
perusing, cussing, mangling, and potentially fouling up beyond all
recognition.
You can open any Word document by following these steps. The document
can be on the desktop, in the Documents folder, or in any other folder or
location where a Word document icon can lurk.
 The document name appears beneath or to the right of the icon. You
can use the name to determine the document’s contents — as long as
the document was properly named when it was saved to disk. (More
on that later.)

shortcut to that document on the desktop for quick access: Right-click
the document’s icon and choose Send To➪Desktop (Create Shortcut).
 Word is capable of opening other types of documents, including docu-
ments from previous versions of Word, Rich Text Format documents,
and others. Each of these documents has its own icon, though the icon
looks similar to the standard Word document icon. See Chapter 25 for
more information on opening alien documents in Word.
 You can see a list of the recent documents you’ve worked on by choos-
ing the Recent Items or My Recent Documents submenu from the main
Start menu. Choose your document from that list to open it.
Behold Word!
Word appears on your computer’s monitor just like any other program, nes-
tled within its own window. Look on the screen and at Figure 1-2. There’s
more to Word and word processing than an electronic version of the blank
sheet of paper.
The details of what you see on the screen are covered elsewhere in this book.
Because you may not know what each doodad and greeblie is called, I’ve
labeled some of the important things in Figure 1-2. Use this book’s index to
help you find stuff you might be curious about.
 Word 2007 represents a new approach to word processing. Gone are the
menus and toolbars that have dominated computer programs for a
decade or more. Replacing them is a new, tabbed, Ribbon interface.
Although it may be intimidating at first, don’t let it overwhelm you. Just
keep reading this book and you’ll be fine.
 The very first time you start Word, you may be asked some questions:
Enter your name and initials, set up Word security, and set Microsoft
update options. I recommend the updates.
Maximize Word’s window size
Unless your computer system has one of those huge monitors, you probably
want to maximize the Word program window just before you start working.
To run Word in full-screen mode, click the Maximize button (the middle one)
in the upper-right corner of the window.
Maximizing forces a window to fill the entire screen. If Word is already maxi-
mized, two overlapping boxes appear on the button; you don’t need to click
anything in that case.
16
Part I: Hello, Word! 

Just in case your computer system is blessed with a giant monitor, you can
resize the Word window without maximizing it; drag any of the window’s
edges in or out.
Word’s window size affects what you see in the Ribbon’s command groups.
On smaller screens, fewer buttons show up, or they may show up in three
rows. On larger screens, you see more buttons, usually in two rows.

Chapter 1: Word Hokey-Pokey

Look! Up on the screen!
Everything in the Word window is designed to help you write. No, I’m serious!
Well, I don’t mean write in the sense of Ernest Hemingway or Jane Austen,
although that’s possible. Word wants you to manage, organize, and create
things with words. That’s the essence of word processing. What you see on
the screen, on Word’s interface, is designed to make writing an easy and
effortless task.
The largest portion of the Word screen is for composing text. It’s blank and
white, just like a fresh sheet of paper. (Refer to Figure 1-2.) That’s where you
compose and format your text, and I cover that area specifically in the next
section.
Surrounding the text-composing area is a host of goobers that are as bewilder-
ing as an exhibit in a modern art museum, as intimidating as the cockpit of a jet
fighter, and almost as dangerous as a plate of sushi. Despite their overwhelm-
ing appearance, the things that cling to the Word program window are there to
help you write. The following list gives you the quick top-to-bottom explana-
tion. Use Figure 1-2 for reference. And, please: Do not memorize anything!
 The title bar lists the document’s title, or merely Document 1 until you
give the document a title by saving it to disk. (See Chapter 9 for informa-
tion on saving documents — very important!)
 The Office button replaces the traditional File menu of most Windows
programs. Clicking the Office Button displays the Office Button menu, a
list of commands that deal with files and documents.
 Tabs organize Word’s various and sundry commands into groups based
on word processing activities. Tabs appear and disappear depending on
what you’re doing in Word.
 Groups and command buttons help keep commands for the various
tabs organized. Each group contains command buttons that do specific
things to your text.
 The Ruler may or may not be visible. When the Ruler is visible, it helps
you set margins and tabs. The View Ruler button (refer to Figure 1-2)
shows and hides the Ruler.
Below the writing area dwells the status bar. This informative strip of graphi-
cal goodness contains trivial information about your document as well as the
following ornaments:
 Document information lists optional data specific to your document.
 The View buttons specify how the blank page appears in the window
(also refer to the next section).
 The Zoom thing sets how large or small your document appears inside
the window. (See Chapter 30 for more information on zooming.)
18
Part I: Hello, Word! 

Don’t fret over these things! What’s important now is that you recognize the
names of things so that you don’t get lost later.
 The tabs, groups, and command buttons change as you take on various
activities in Word. Although this may seem disruptive, it’s in fact quite
handy.
 You can hide the Ribbon if you would rather have more room to write:
Right-click anywhere on the Ribbon and choose the Minimize Ribbon
command from the pop-up menu. To restore the Ribbon, right-click any
tab and choose the Minimize Ribbon command again.
 Another part of the window, not shown in Figure 1-2, is the task pane. It
shows up when it’s needed, to offer more choices, options, or information.
 A Document Recovery task pane may show up when Word starts, telling
you that Word has saved a document that may have been lost because
of a power failure or computer crash. Refer to Chapter 32 for informa-
tion on the AutoRecover feature.
 The Windows taskbar, located at the bottom of the screen, is a part of
Windows itself and not Word. However, as you open documents in Word,
buttons representing those documents appear on the Windows taskbar.
 Unlike in previous versions of Word, the tabs, groups, and command but-
tons cannot be customized, moved, or resized. You can customize the
Quick Access toolbar (refer to Figure 1-2), but that’s about it.
The blank place where you write
The words you write appear in the center part of Word’s program window, in
that blank area shown in Figure 1-2. That pallid vista is the equivalent of a
blank sheet of paper, and the documents you create on that electronic sheet
of paper look just the way they will when they’re eventually printed on a real
sheet of paper. Such is the magic of word processing.
Word lets you view the blank sheet in five different ways. Two of the views
are the most popular for wordsmiths:
 Print Layout: Activate this view by clicking the status bar’s Print Layout
button. In Print Layout view, you get to see the entire page, just as it
prints. Graphical images, columns, and all sorts of other fancy items
show up on the page fully visible. You can see the edge of the page and a
blank space between pages (the “Ethereal void” in Figure 1-2).
 Draft: Set this view by clicking the Draft button on the status bar. Draft
view is favored by writers who don’t really want to clutter the page with
anything other than text. In Draft view, you see your text and not the
fancy graphics, columns, headers, page breaks, and other things that
clutter Print Layout mode.
19
Chapter 1: Word Hokey-Pokey

There are three other ways to view your document: Full Screen Reading, Web
Layout, and Outline. None of these views has anything to do with basic word
processing. Refer to Chapter 26 for more information on these different views.
 Word automatically switches to Print Layout view from Draft view when
necessary. So, when you’re working in Draft view and you want to edit
a header or insert a picture, Print Layout view is activated. You need
to manually switch back to Draft view, if that’s your preferred way of
using Word.
 One thing that’s visible in Draft view that you don’t find in Print Layout
view is a thick, horizontal bar on the left side of the page, just below a
document’s last line of text. That heavy bar marks the end of your docu-
ment. You cannot delete the bar — unless you switch from Draft view to
Print Layout view.
 Draft view may also be referred to as Normal view, as it was in previous
versions of Word.
 Writing (or typing, depending on how good you are) is covered in the
next chapter. That would be Chapter 2.
 Any weird stuff you see onscreen (a ¶, for example) is a Word secret
symbol. Chapter 2 tells you why you may want to view those secret sym-
bols and how to hide them if they annoy you.
The mouse pointer in Word
Word processing is a keyboard thing, although the computer’s mouse comes
in handy. In Word, you use the mouse to choose commands and to move the
insertion pointer around as you edit text.
The mouse pointer changes its look as you work in Word:
For editing text, the mouse pointer becomes the I-beam.
For choosing items, the standard eleven o’clock mouse pointer is used.
For selecting lines of text, a one o’clock mouse pointer is used.
In Print Layout view, the mouse pointer may change its look when click-and-
type mode is active: Lines appear to the left and right of, and below, the 
I-beam mouse pointer. Refer to Chapter 33 for more information on using
click-and-type.
20
Part I: Hello, Word! 

Memorizing these mouse pointer types isn’t important, but remember that
the mouse pointer changes as you use Word.
 You can use the mouse to see what some of the little buttons and things
with pictures on them do in Word. Just hover the mouse pointer over
the button, and — voilà! — it’s like Folgers instant information crystals.
 Chapter 4 discusses how to use the mouse pointer to move the insertion
pointer, allowing you to edit different parts of your text.
Cajoling Word to Help You
There are many ways to extract help from Word, the most common of which
is to press the F1 key. That key not only works in Word’s main window, but
can also summon specific help for when you’re doing certain things, such as
when you’re performing some obscure task way inside some dialog box or
task pane.
Summoning Word Help displays a separate program window labeled Word
Help, as shown in Figure 1-3. You can type a topic, command name, or ques-
tion into the box in the upper-left corner of the window, or you can browse
the table of contents for help.
Figure 1-3:
Word’s
feeble
attempts to
help you.
21
Chapter 1: Word Hokey-Pokey

 You can also summon help by clicking the wee round question mark
button near the upper-right corner of the Word window.
 Word’s help works best when you have an Internet connection, espe-
cially a high-speed, or broadband, connection.
 If you’ve used previous versions of Word, note that there’s no more
Office Assistant in Word 2007. You can mourn or rejoice as appropriate.
 Of course, this book can be your handiest and most useful source for
Word help. Sadly, I don’t have room here to document everything, so
Microsoft relented and decided to provide everything in its Word Help
window.
When You’re All Done
It’s the pinnacle of etiquette to know when and how to excuse oneself.
Leaving can be done well or poorly. Experience taught me this lesson when I
was dining with royalty and suddenly all conversation stopped. I had to
meekly raise my hand, mutter “It was me,” and then run off all red-faced and
ashamed. I hope that such a thing never happens to you.
Just as there are many ways to start Word, there are several ways to quit. You
can quit the program outright, you can pause and start over, or you can set
Word aside. These options are covered in this section.
Quitting Word
When you’re done word processing and don’t expect to return to it anytime
soon, you need to quit the Word program. Quitting a computer program is
like putting away a book on a shelf. In the electronic world of the computer,
this is how you do such a thing:
1. Choose Exit Word from the Office Button menu.
2. Save any files when Word prompts you to do so.
Word always warns you before it leaves; if you have any unsaved docu-
ments, you’re prompted to save them to disk. You see a warning dis-
played on the screen, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Click Yes to save your file. You may be asked to give the file a name, if
you haven’t yet done so. (Chapter 3 tells you how to do it.)
If the slop you typed isn’t worth saving, click No.
You can click Cancel to “quit” the Exit Word command and return to
Word for more word processing delight.
22
Part I: Hello, Word! 

If you elect to quit, Word closes its window. Poof! It’s gone. You return to
Windows or some other program, such as FreeCell, which you know you
shouldn’t be playing anyway.
 You don’t have to quit Word just to start editing another document.
Refer to the next few sections for helpful, time-saving information!
 Do not quit Word by resetting or turning off your computer! It’s a bad
thing. Trust me on this one.
How to quit what you’re doing
without quitting Word
It’s not always necessary to quit Word. For example, if you’re merely stopping
work on one document to work on another, quitting Word is a waste of time.
Instead, you can close one document and then open another. Or, better still,
you can simply open the new document and keep the old one active; you can
then easily switch between the documents.
To close a document in Word, choose the Close command from the Office
Button menu. This doesn’t quit Word, but it removes the document from the
screen, allowing you to stay in Word or work on another document.
Likewise, you can start up a new document in Word, just like sticking a blank
sheet of paper into a typewriter. See Chapter 3, the section about starting out
with a new document.
Bottom line: There’s no point is quitting Word when all you want to do is start
editing a new document.
 Closing a document in Word is similar to ripping a sheet of paper out
of your typewriter — but without the satisfying SSHHHHHTHWP! sound
it makes.
 There’s no need to close a document, really. In fact, I work on a docu-
ment over a period of days and keep it open (and my PC on) the entire
time. Doesn’t hurt a thing. (I do occasionally save it to disk, which is
important.)
Figure 1-4:
Better click
that Yes
button!
23
Chapter 1: Word Hokey-Pokey

 When you try to close a document before it has been saved, Word dis-
plays a warning dialog box. Click the Yes button to save your document.
If you want to continue editing, click the Cancel button and get back
to work.
 The keyboard shortcut for the Close command is Ctrl+W.
Putting Word away for a spell
There’s no need to quit Word if you know that you will be using it again soon.
In fact, I’ve been known to keep Word open and running on my computer for
weeks at a time. The secret is to use the Minimize button.
Clicking the Minimize button shrinks the Word window to a button on the
taskbar. Thwoop! It’s gone! With the window out of the way, you can do other
things with your computer. Then, when you’re ready to word-process again,
click the Word button on the taskbar to restore the Word window to the screen.
The Minimize button is the first of the three buttons in the window’s upper-
right corner. Refer to Figure 1-2.

espite the mouse, despite the graphics, Word exists as a program
requiring a lot of keyboard input. To best enjoy Word, you should know
your computer’s keyboard. This means knowing not only where and how to
press the keys, but also how certain keys on the keyboard are used in a word
processor. This chapter unlocks those secrets that would otherwise linger
inside your computer keyboard — along with all those potato chip crumbs,
nail clippings, and gross strands of hair.
Behold the PC Keyboard!
Despite all the fancy keyboard extras, as far as word processing is consid-
ered, you use only the core keys on the keyboard, keys commonly found on
every computer keyboard, as illustrated in Figure 2-1.
Take a look at your own keyboard. If you’re lucky, it may be color-coded to
help you identify the separate areas.

When you use Word, you use the keys in groups, either alone or in combina-
tion with other keys. Here are the names by which the computer nerds know
these things:
 Function keys: The function keys are labeled F1 through F12. You can
use them alone or in cahoots with the Ctrl, Alt, and Shift keys.
 Typewriter keys: These are the standard alphanumeric keys that the
computer inherited from the antique typewriter: A through Z and the
number keys, plus symbols and other exotic characters.
 Cursor keys: Also called the arrow keys, these keys control the cursor.
Also included are the non-arrow keys: Home, End, PgUp (or Page Up),
PgDn (or Page Down), Insert, and Delete.
 Don key: A domesticated ass.
 Numeric keypad: These keys are sometimes cursor keys and other
times number keys. The split personality is evident on each key cap,
which displays two symbols. The Num Lock key and its corresponding
light are on if the numeric keypad (1, 2, 3) is active. If the cursor keys
(arrows, Home) are active, Num Lock is off.

Part I: Hello, Word! 
Depressing the keys
You don’t actually depress a key on a computer
keyboard. Nope. Instead, you press and release.
Any swift tapping motion will do. Some key-
boards even generate a pleasing click when a
key is pressed.
Now, if you really want to depress a key, just
stare at it and say “You’re one ugly, good-for-
nothing key!” If that doesn’t work, keep up with
the insults. Eventually, any well-adjusted key
will succumb to your verbal taunts and find itself
sufficiently depressed.

 Shift keys: These keys don’t do anything by themselves. Instead, the Shift,
Ctrl, and Alt keys work in combination with other keys.
Here are some individual keys worth noting:
 Enter: Marked with the word Enter and sometimes a cryptic, curved
arrow-thing: ↵. You use this key to end a paragraph of text.
 Esc: The “escape” key, which doesn’t really do anything in Word. However,
pressing the Esc key in a dialog box is the same as clicking the Cancel
button with the mouse.
 Spacebar: The only key with no symbol; inserts spaces between the
words.
 Tab: Inserts the tab “character,” which shoves the next text you type
over to the next tab stop; an interesting and potentially frustrating for-
matting key (and nicely covered in Chapter 13).
 Backspace: Your backing-up-and-erasing key — very handy.
 Delete: Also labeled Del; works like Backspace but doesn’t back up to
erase. Read more on that in Chapter 5.
Every character key you press on the keyboard produces a character on the
screen, on the blank part where you write. (Check out Figure 1-2, over in
Chapter 1.)
 The Shift key is used to produce capital letters, just like on a typewriter
(in case you’ve ever used one of those).
 Ctrl is pronounced “control.” It’s amazing the variety of names people
give to the Ctrl key before they know it as the control key.
 The Caps Lock key works like the Shift Lock key on a typewriter. After
you press Caps Lock, the Caps Lock light on your keyboard comes on,
and everything you type is in ALL CAPS.
Typing (Or, the Old Hunt-and-Peck)
Words electric march across the screen because you type those words on the
keyboard. Despite all the commands and graphical goobers, the thing you do
most often in Word is type.
Clackity-clack-clack-clack.
Everything you type on the keyboard appears on the screen, even the typos
and mistakes and bad grammar: It all falls into place on the screen regardless
of your intent, posture, or good looks.
27
Chapter 2: Making Friends with the Keyboard

Follow the blinking cursor
The key to writing in Word is to look for the insertion pointer in your text. It’s
a flashing vertical bar:
|
Text you type appears before the insertion pointer, one character at a time.
After a character appears, the insertion pointer hops to the right, making
room for more text.
For example, type this line:
Why blame the computer?
The insertion pointer moves to the right, marching along as you type. It’s
called insertion pointer for a reason: Press the left-arrow key a few times to
move the insertion pointer back before the word blame.
Type the word not and a space. The word (and the space) are inserted into
your text. The text to the right is pushed off to make room for the new text.
Now the sentence should read:
Why not blame the computer?
Chapter 4 covers moving the insertion pointer around in more detail.
When to press that Enter key
In word processing, you press the Enter key only when you reach the end of a
paragraph. Not the end of a line, the end of a paragraph. You do this thanks to
28
Part I: Hello, Word! 
“Do I need to learn to type?”
No one needs to learn to type to use a word
processor, but you do yourself a favor when you
learn. My advice is to get a computer program
that teaches you to type. I can recommend the
Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing program, even
though I don’t get any money from her and none
of her children resembles me. I just like the
name Mavis, I suppose.
Knowing how to type makes a painful experi-
ence like using Word a wee bit more enjoyable.

a neat-o feature called word wrap. When the text you type reaches the right
margin, the insertion pointer automatically hops down to the next line of
text, taking any incompletely typed word along for the ride.
To witness word wrap for yourself, start Word and type the following text,
without pressing the Enter key:
When the times were hard, we knew what had to be done.
Eatin’ was necessary. So as we all sat down to the meal,
and that sweet aroma of roasted meat hit our nostrils for
the first time in months, we held firm. It was especially
hard when little Dana innocently asked where her pet bunny
Fluffy had gone.
As you type, and as words grow precariously close to the right margin, Word
magically picks up an incomplete word and places it on the following line.
That’s word wrap in action. It’s automatic, and it means that there’s no need
to press the Enter key until you reach the end of a paragraph.
 Some people end a paragraph with two presses of the Enter key; others
use only one press. If it’s extra space you want between paragraphs, refer
to Chapter 12, the section about putting space between paragraphs, to see
what to do.
 There’s no need to use the Enter key when you want to double-space your
text. Double-spacing is a formatting command in Word. See Chapter 12 for
more information.
 If you want to indent a paragraph, press the Tab key after pressing Enter.
This can also be done automatically; refer to (you guessed it) Chapter 12.
When to whack the spacebar
The spacebar isn’t the same thing as the right-arrow key on the keyboard.
Pressing the spacebar doesn’t just move the insertion pointer; it inserts a
space character into the text. Spaces are important between words and sen-
tences. Withoutthemreadingwouldbedifficult.
The most important thing to remember about the spacebar is that you need to
whack it only once. In word processing, as in all typing done on a computer,
only one space appears between words and after punctuation. That’s it!
 I’m serious! If you’re an old-timer, you’re probably used to putting two
spaces after a period, which is what they taught in typing class. This
extra space is wrong on a computer. Type only one space!
 Anytime you feel like using two or more spaces, what you really need is
a tab. Tabs are best for indenting text as well as for lining up text in
columns. See Chapter 13 for more information.
29
Chapter 2: Making Friends with the Keyboard

 The reason you need only one space between sentences is that computers
use proportionally spaced type. Old-fashioned typewriters used mono-
spaced type, and so pressing the spacebar twice after a sentence was
supposed to aid in readability (though that’s debatable). Computer type 
is more like professionally typeset material, and both typesetters and 
professional-document folk put only one space after a period or a colon.
So there!
Backing-up and erasing keys
When you make a typo or other typing error, press the Backspace key on the
keyboard. The Backspace key is used to back up and erase. The Delete key
can also be used to erase text.
 Refer to Chapter 5 for more information on deleting text with Backspace
and Delete.
 The Backspace key is named Backspace on your keyboard, or it may
have a long, left-pointing arrow on it: ←.
 Backspace doesn’t work like the Backspace key on a typewriter. The dif-
ference is that when you press Backspace in Word, the cursor backs up
and erases. (The Word equivalent of the typewriter’s Backspace key is
the left-arrow key.)
Mind your 1’s and 0’s and L’s and O’s
If you’re a former typewriter user, you’re probably pushing 40! Man, you’re
old! Seriously, my geriatric friend, the typewriter is merely inspiration for the
computer keyboard. Beyond that, the similarity is purely superficial. Please
heed these advice nuggets:
 Do not use the little L or the big I in place of the number one. Use the 1
key. That’s what it’s there for.
 Do not use the O (oh) key for the number zero. Use the 0 (zero) key.
These habits may be hard to break, but the computer is keen on being exact.
Oh, and Geritol now comes in cherry flavor.

Things to Notice Whilst You Type
The text you type appears on the computer screen, in the blank, page-like area
in the middle of the Word window. But that’s not all! As you type, you may
notice other things going on. These aren’t bugs crawling on the screen, nor
are they signs that you need to have your eyes checked. These side effects of
typing may puzzle you or annoy you; either way, this section explains things.
The left end of the status bar
The reason it’s called the status bar is that it can show you the status of your
document, lively updating the information as you type, as shown in Figure 2-2.
The type of information that’s displayed, as well as how much information is
displayed, depends on how you’ve configured Word. Chapter 30 explains
which features the status bar can display.
 The status bar also displays information when you initially open a docu-
ment, giving the document’s name and character count. That disappears
quickly, however.
 When a document is saved, the status bar displays information about
the save, though often the information appears too fast to see.

Curse you, StickyKeys!
As your mind wanders, your fingers absently
press and release the Shift key. Suddenly, you
see the warning: StickyKeys! By pressing the
Shift, Ctrl, or Alt key five times in a row, you acti-
vate the Windows XP StickyKeys function, a tool
designed to help disabled people more easily use
a computer keyboard. Rather than be glad for the
help, you’re annoyed at the intrusion.
Don’t panic! It’s easy to turn off the StickyKeys
thing: Open the Control Panel’s Accessibility
Options icon to display the Accessibility Options
dialog box. In that dialog box, remove the check
mark by the item labeled Use StickyKeys. Click
OK, and you’ll never be bothered again!

Life between pages
Word not only shows you on the screen your text as it will be printed, but
also tries its best to show you where one page ends and another page begins.
This feature is most helpful because often times you want to keep things on
one page, or it could just be that folks like to know when they’re moving from
one page to the next.
The status bar helps you discover which page you’re working on, as dis-
cussed in the previous section. Visually, Word also helps you by graphically
showing you where one page ends and another begins.
In Print Layout view, you see virtual pages and a space between them, as
shown in Figure 2-3. That’s your best visual clue to where one page ends and
another begins.
In Draft mode, the visual break between pages is shown as a faint line of dots,
like ants marching across the page:
Text appearing above the line of dots is on one page, and text below is on the
next page.
 Refer to Chapter 1, the section “The blank place where you write,” for
more information on Print Layout and Draft views.
 Technically, the page break is a soft page break, meaning that one
page full of text and Word must start putting text on a new page. See
Chapter 14 for information on forcing page breaks and other types of
page breaks in Word.
Figure 2-3:

Part I: Hello, Word! 

 You can adjust the gap between pages in Print Layout view. Point the
mouse at the gap. When the mouse pointer changes, as shown in the
margin, press the Ctrl key and click the mouse to remove or set the gap.
 Use the Page item on the status bar to confirm which page you’re writing
on. Note that the page number changes as you move from one page to
the next.
Spots and clutter in your text
There’s no cause for alarm if you see spots — or dots — amid the text you
type, such as
This•can•be•very•annoying.¶
What you’re seeing here, and potentially on the screen, are nonprinting char-
acters. Word uses various symbols to represent things you normally wouldn’t
see: spaces, tabs, the Enter key, and more.
To turn these items on or off, click the Show/Hide button on the Home tab in
the Paragraph group. Click once to show the goobers; click again to hide them.
The keyboard shortcut for the Paragraph button is Ctrl+Shift+8.
Why bother? Sometimes it’s useful to see the marks to check out what’s up
with formatting, find stray tabs visually, or locate missing paragraphs, for
example. (WordPerfect users: This is as close as you can get to Reveal Codes
in Word.)
Strange underlines and colored text
Adding underlining to your text in Word is cinchy; Chapter 11 tells you all
about that character format. Yet, sometimes Word may do some underlining
on its own, with colorful zigzags or dots. What Word is doing is alerting you
to certain special aspects of that underlined text.
Red zigzag: Spelling errors in Word are underlined with a red zigzag. See
Chapter 8.
Green zigzag: Grammatical errors in Word are underlined with a green
zigzag. See Chapter 8.
Blue zigzag: Word-choice errors are really grammatical errors, but Word
flags them with a special blue zigzag regardless. The blue underlined
word is most likely not the best word to use given the sentence structure.
Again, see Chapter 8.
33
Chapter 2: Making Friends with the Keyboard

Purple dots: Word’s Smart Tags feature uses purple dots to highlight
information such as names, dates, places, and similar data that can be
shared with other programs in Microsoft Office. Smart Tags are briefly
discussed in Chapter 33.
Blue underlines. Word courteously highlights Web page addresses using
blue, underlined text in your document. You can Ctrl+click that blue
underline text to visit the Web page.
Colored text and underlines: When your text appears in color and under-
lined, or with strikethrough, and assuming that you haven’t specifically
set those formatting options, it means you have revision marks turned on.
Refer to Chapter 27 for more information on revision marks and how to
turn them off.
Generally speaking, ignore all squiggly lines until you move into the editing
phase for your document. (Well, unless you become obsessive, but that tends
to slow down the writing process.) Later chapters in this book describe how
to deal with the various underlines I just mentioned.
Word can type that for you
Sometimes when you’re typing and in the middle of something, you see a
pop-up bubble appear above your text, as shown in Figure 2-4. That’s the
AutoComplete feature in action. Basically, AutoComplete is Word guessing at
what you’re typing.
When Word has guessed correctly, press the Enter key, and Word inserts the
rest of the text. If Word is out of its mind, keep on typing, and the bubble goes
away.

A
s far as word processing software goes, Word is like a wardrobe full of
clothing: Word’s closet of clothes includes a selection of formal wear,
office attire, casual and “golf” clothing, beach and boating wear, gardening
attire, semiformal evening wear, and everything else from shorts to slacks,
socks to spats, and cuff links to top hats. Given all that Word offers, most
folks spend only two seconds in the Word wardrobe, donning every time the
same old pair of jeans and ratty T-shirt.
It’s estimated that most people use less than one-tenth of Word’s features.
There’s nothing wrong with that; the power and variety are there when you
need them. For most word processing chores, though, getting by with the
simple steps outlined in this chapter is about all you need. The rest is fluff,
there when you need it — or when you want your work to look better than
the mediocre junk made by the masses, who only scratch the surface of what
Word can do.

The Overview
The word processing routine works like this:
1. Start a new document.
2. Type.
3. Format.
4. Save.
5. Review or preview (optional).
6. Print.
7. Save and close.
Everyone follows these steps in one way or another. A good Word user
repeats Steps 2, 3, and 4, sometimes varying the order. Overall, most of the
time you’re typing in Word.
When you’ve saved a document and want to work on it again, replace Step 1
with “Open a document on disk.” A lot of word processing involves working
on stuff you’ve already started or on things started by others. Refer to
Chapter 9 for more information on opening documents.
Formatting, at this level, merely involves selecting a font or two, perhaps
applying some character formatting (italics or bold), and maybe adding page
numbering. This is really “formatting as you type,” as opposed to the more-
formal formatting used by the pros. See Part III of this book for chapters on
formatting various parts of a Word document.
Skipping Step 4 is one of the biggest mistakes beginners make. Save your
stuff! Even trivial stuff. Deleting trivial stuff later is easier than re-creating it
from scratch. See Chapter 9 for information on saving.
Steps 5 and 6 are necessary only when you’re done and plan on printing your
work. Refer to Chapter 8 for a discussion on how to proof your document.
Chapter 10 covers printing.
When you’re done, of course, you need to properly quit Word or merely close
and save the document you created. Then you’re ready to do something else
with the computer. Quitting Word is covered at the end of Chapter 1.
36
Part I: Hello, Word! 

Starting Out with a New Document
When you start your word processing day, Word automatically presents you
with a blank sheet of paper — a blank document — on which you can start
writing. That’s what most folks do, making this the easiest step of your word
processing day.
If you’re ready to start typing, skip to the next section.
When you’re already using Word and need to start a new document, follow
these steps to summon that blank sheet o’ paper:
1. Choose the New command from the Office Button menu.
The New Document window appears, giving you too many options for
creating a new something-or-other, as shown in Figure 3-1. What you
want is a blank document.
2. Click the Create button to choose Blank Document.
The blank document option is preselected for you. All you need to
do is click the Create button, or press the Enter key, to make the New
Document window go away, and you see your blank page, ready for
typing.
Figure 3-1:
Overwhelm-
ing new
document
options.
37
Chapter 3: A Quick Guide to Word (For the Impatient)

You can repeat these steps as often as you need new documents; Word lets
you work with many documents at a time. (See Chapter 25 for information on
multiple-document mania.)
 Ah, the shortcut: Press Ctrl+N to quickly summon a new blank document
in Word.
 Another way to start your work is to open a document on disk. To 
do this, use the Open command form the Office Button menu, which 
is covered in Chapter 9.
 The New Document window contains many options for starting some-
thing new in Word. Rather than use the Blank Document choice, lots 
of folks use templates to start documents. Templates help save time by
predefining document layout and formatting (and sometimes even text).
See Chapter 17 for more information on the handy-dandy template.
Typing the Text
Of all the wacky things you can do with a computer, typing makes the most
sense. In Word, the text you type at the keyboard appears on the screen. It’s
easy. In fact, there are few hang-ups regarding typing in Word.
 Refer to the section in Chapter 2 about typing (or the old hunt-and-peck)
for typing tips and suggestions.
 A big part of typing in Word includes moving the insertion pointer, or
cursor, around inside your document. Although some people find
moving the cursor an easy thing, I recommend checking out Chapter 4 
to help hone your insertion pointer prowess.
Formatting a Document
Formatting makes your documents look professional and not like you’re
using an abused typewriter from a smelly thrift store. And formatting is more
than just making some text italic or bold or adding a heading to your docu-
ment. In Word, formatting includes lines, styles, colors, textures, pictures —
all sorts of fun stuff.
In Word, you can format the following parts of a document:
 Characters
 Paragraphs
 Tabs
38
Part I: Hello, Word! 

 Pages
 Columns
 Headers and footers
 The entire document
Word lets you manipulate each of these items in a variety of interesting and
creative ways: margins, boxes, spacing, indents, lines, shading, page orienta-
tion, and on and on. But remember the following admonishment:
Your primary duty in word processing is to get down the text.
Text comes first! Get your ideas down. After that, you can go back and format
and change the text style or adjust the margins. Speaking from experience
here, when you get hung up on formatting, you lose your train of thought and
your document suffers. Write first; format afterward.
 Most folks format text as they type, by adding italic or bold or whatever.
That’s fine, and this book shows you some keen shortcuts that make such
character formatting easy and not distracting to your chain of thought.
 You can also format paragraphs as you write, although I still recommend
keeping the major formatting chores for after you write your text.
 Word also lets you format your document by adding drawings, pictures,
lines, tables, columns, or other elements that can really make things
look snazzy. Parts III and IV covers those topics.
Save Your Stuff!
The biggest mistake made by computer users is not saving their stuff. In Word,
you must soon, regularly, and often save your documents to disk. Only when a
document has been saved on disk can you use it again later or retrieve it after
a power outage or when you forgetfully quit Word without saving.
There are two ways to save a document:
 The first time
 Every time after the first time
The first time you save a document, you must assign the document a name, or
filename. That’s the name by which you can recognize the document when you
see its icon in Windows. The name also helps you determine the file’s contents.
39
Chapter 3: A Quick Guide to Word (For the Impatient)

After initially saving a document to disk, you merely need to update it. So,
as you’re working, you save again. There’s no need to choose the filename at
this point; the computer merely overwrites the old file on disk with your new,
updated document.
To save a document to disk the first time, choose the Save command from the
Office Button menu. The first time you save a document, the Save As dialog box
appears. It looks different between Windows Vista and Windows XP, as shown
in Figures 3-2 and 3-3, yet both dialog boxes work the same: Type a name for
your document in the File Name area. (The name “The Forest” is shown in
Figures 3-2 and 3-3.) If you make a mistake typing, press the Backspace key to
back up and erase. Click the Save button to save your document.
To save a document as you’re working on it, just keep choosing the Save com-
mand from the Office Button menu. It updates the document on disk with
your most recent changes.

dialog box,

40
Part I: Hello, Word! 

 Refer to Chapter 9 for more details about saving your document.
 Computers are forgetful beasts. Saving a document to disk is like making
a permanent copy of the document and storing it in a file cabinet. In fact,
the computer refers to documents saved on disk as files. Understanding
the concept of the file is important in using a computer. If you need
more information, I recommend my book PCs For Dummies (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
 If you’ve opened a document already on disk, there’s no need to save it
for the first time; in fact, the document has already been saved once! You
merely need to choose the Save command from the Office Button menu
to update the document as you make changes.
 Rather than choose the Save command from the Office Button menu,
you can click the Save button on the toolbar. Or, from the keyboard, you
can press the Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut.
 When you save a document, watch the status bar — it temporarily dis-
plays a message telling you that Word is saving your document (or fast
saving, for our frequent fliers).
 After the document is saved to disk, you see its name displayed on the
window’s title bar. That name is your clue that your document has been
saved to disk.
Finishing a Document
The last thing you need to do is finish your work. Mostly, that involves print-
ing your document. In fact, you may not think of printing simply because
until the word processor came about, every other writing device in history
was also its own printer: the rock, the stylus, the pen, the typewriter — each
of those writing implements printed as the author wrote. With word process-
ing, printing becomes a necessary, if not final, step.
I recommend three steps to the printing process:
 Proof
 Preview
 Print
Each of these steps is covered in this section.
41
Chapter 3: A Quick Guide to Word (For the Impatient)

Proofing your work
Just because you’re writing on a word processor and the text looks really
neat and graphics and nifty things are right up there on the screen doesn’t
mean that what you wrote is perfect. I highly recommend that you proof your
document before you print.
Proofing means reading. Read and review your documents. It also means
checking spelling and grammar, which Word does automatically. Refer to
Chapter 8 for more information.
Previewing a document
Before you print, I recommend previewing what the final document looks like.
Yeah, even though what you’ve written is supposed to look the same on the
screen as it does on the paper, you may still see surprises: missing page num-
bers, blank pages, or half pages, for example. The best way to find those sur-
prises before printing is to use the Print Preview feature.
Choose Print➪Print Preview from the Office Button menu. The Print Preview
command changes the way Word looks on the screen, as shown in Figure 3-4.
You can review your document one page at a time or as multiple pages. You
can zoom in and out, and you can even edit, although I don’t recommend it.
Click the Close Print Preview button to leave Print Preview mode, in case you
need to return to your document for editing and touch-ups. Otherwise, you
can print directly from Print Preview mode by choosing the Print command
button in the Print group (shown in Figure 3-4).
Printing a document
Printing the document is easy to do:
1. Make sure that the printer is on and ready to print.
2. Choose the Print command from the Office Button menu, or click the
Print button when you’re using the Print Preview feature.
The Print dialog box opens. In this busy place, printing and related activ-
ities happen.
3. Click the OK button.
The document comes out of your printer.
42
Part I: Hello, Word! 

Printing is often a source of woe for computer users. That’s because the
printer really is its own, specialized computer, one that’s designed for print-
ing stuff. Getting your computer and the printer/computer to work well
together can be an art form.
 See Chapter 10 for additional information about preparing the printer if
you need to.
 You can also summon the Print dialog box by pressing Ctrl+P on the
keyboard.
 I highly recommend that you save your document before you print —
just in case! I’m a stickler for saving, saving, saving your document.

Part I: Hello, Word! 
Wrapping Things Up
When you’re done writing, you need to do the electronic equivalent of putting
a document away. That electronic equivalent is the Close command: Choose
the Close command from the Office Button menu, or use the handy Ctrl+W
keyboard shortcut.
If you haven’t saved your document recently, Word prompts you to save before
you close; click the Yes button and the document is saved. (If it hasn’t yet been
saved — shame on you! — you see the Save As dialog box; refer to Chapter 9).
When the document has been saved, closing it simply removes it from view.
At that point, you can quit Word, start up a new document, open a document
on disk, or just put away Word and hit another game of Spider Solitaire.
 Also refer to Chapter 1 for more quitting options.
 You don’t have to choose the Close command. You can choose the Exit
Word command from the Office Button menu if you’re all done with
Word, which is almost the same thing: You’re prompted to save your
document if it needs saving; otherwise, the Exit Word command quits
Word rather than keeps the window open.
 If you’re working on only one document and you close it, Word looks like
it has vacated the premises: Tabs and command buttons dim, and other
screen debris goes away. Don’t panic; you’ve just closed a document, and
Word has little else to do. Word sits patiently and waits for your next com-
mand: Start a new document, open a document on disk, or quit Word.

Part II
Word Processing
Basics

In this part . . .
A
lthough it never made the papers, for the past
25 years a word processing revolution has been
taking place. The primitive, steam-powered computers
of the 1970s had word processors that were little more
than text editors, with simple features, such as deleting
and inserting text, search and replace, and maybe even
word wrap.
As competition arose, various word processors had to
evolve with new features to stay competitive. At first,
the features were honestly useful to the wordsmith:
text and paragraph formatting, page numbering, and
even spell checking. But as the competition grew fierce,
some clunky features were added as each word process-
ing program tried to one-up the other. (This explains why
Word has so many commands and options.)
It was in the late 1980s, at the height of the feature wars,
that a basic set of word processing duties evolved. Over
time, these duties were honed into the core tasks covered
by the chapters in this part of the book. These tasks are
what I call the word processing basics.

T
he beauty of the word processor is that it allows you the freedom to edit
your text, and to write and rewrite, without having to start over each
time with a new, blank sheet of paper. After the words are on the screen, edit-
ing becomes simple: You can delete text, move text, and insert new text, all
without starting over. But before you can do that, it’s important to know how
to move around a document. This chapter covers one of the first things you
need to learn in Word: how to move about inside your document.
Scrolling a Document
Word’s window can show you only so much of a document at a time. To see
more of the document, you can employ the handy scroll bars as well as some
nifty mouse tricks.
The vertical scroll bar
On the right side of the document part of the window is the vertical scroll
bar (see Figure 4-1). Its operation is similar to the scroll bar in any Windows
program:

 Click the up- or down-arrow buttons at the top and bottom of the verti-
cal scroll bar to scroll your document up or down. The document scrolls
one line of text for each time you click those up- or down-arrow buttons.
 An elevator button appears inside the scroll bar. You can drag this button
with the mouse, up or down, to scroll the document.
 You can click above or below the elevator button to scroll up or down
one screen of text at a time.
The elevator button’s size reflects how much of your document you can see
at a time. When the button doesn’t show up, or is dimmed, the whole docu-
ment appears on-screen. Otherwise, the elevator button gets smaller as your
document grows longer.
The elevator button’s position also helps show you which part of your
document is visible. When the elevator button is at the top of the scroll bar,
you’re viewing pages near the start of the document. When the elevator
button is toward the bottom of the scroll bar, you’re seeing pages near the
document’s end.
Some special bonuses are involved when you drag the elevator button to scroll
through your document. As you drag the button up or down, you see a page
number displayed, as shown in Figure 4-2. When a document is formatted with
heading styles, you also see the heading title below the page number.

Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Scrolling through your document doesn’t move the insertion pointer. If you
start typing, don’t be surprised when Word jerks you back to where the inser-
tion pointer lurks. (Refer to the later section “Commanding the insertion
pointer with the mouse” for help if such a thing bugs you.)
 Scrolling a document doesn’t move the insertion pointer!
 Also refer to Chapter 26 for information on Word’s Reading mode.
 Refer to the section “Using Browse Buttons to Navigate,” later in this
chapter, for information on using the browse buttons, which are located
below the vertical scroll bar.
One paragraph on the horizontal scroll bar
The horizontal scroll bar appears just above the status bar at the bottom of
Word’s window — but only when your document is wider than the window.
When that happens, you can use the horizontal scroll bar to shift the page
back and forth, left and right.
When the horizontal shifting bugs you, consider using Word’s Zoom tool to
adjust the size of your document on the screen. See Chapter 30.
Mouse scrolling tricks
Aside from manipulating the scroll bars, you can use your computer mouse
to fly and flutter about your document. Sadly, this works only when you have
one of those wheel mice. Coincidentally, these tricks are all done by manipu-
lating that unique wheel button:
 Roll the wheel up or down to scroll your document up or down. (The
Mouse icon in the Windows Control Panel sets the number of lines the
document scrolls per wheel click.)
 Press and hold the wheel button to activate scrolling mode. With the
wheel button down, you can move the mouse up or down to pan your
document in that direction.
 If the mouse’s wheel button also tilts from side to side, you can use it to
pan left and right.

Chapter 4: Moving Around a Document Hither, Thither, and Yon

Moving the Insertion Pointer
The beauty of the word processor is that you can edit any part of your docu-
ment; you don’t always have to work at “the end.” The key to pulling off that
trick is to know how to move the insertion pointer to the exact spot you want.
Moving the insertion pointer is important! Scientific studies have shown that
merely looking at the computer screen does no good. As hard as you wish,
new text appears only at the insertion pointer. And, the text you edit or
delete? Yup, the insertion pointer’s location is important there as well.
Obviously, knowing how to move the insertion pointer is a big deal.
Commanding the insertion pointer
with the mouse
The easiest way to put the insertion pointer exactly where you want it is to
point the mouse at that spot in your text and then click the mouse button.
Point, click, move insertion pointer. Simple.
Moving in small increments
(basic arrow keys)
Using the mouse is perhaps the easiest way to move the insertion pointer, but
most experienced Word users take advantage of the keyboard’s cursor keys to
quickly move the insertion pointer to any position in their documents.
The four basic arrow keys move the insertion pointer up, down, right, and left:
Key
To Move the Cursor . . .
↑
Up to the preceding line of text
↓
Down to the next line of text
→
Right to the next character
←
Left to the preceding character
Moving the cursor doesn’t erase characters. See Chapter 5 for information on
deleting stuff.
50
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

If you press and hold the Ctrl (Control) key and then press an arrow key, you
enter hyper-jump mode. The supercharged insertion pointer leaps desper-
ately in all four directions:
Press These Keys
To Move the Cursor . . .
Ctrl+↑
Up to the start of the previous paragraph
Ctrl+↓
Down to the start of the next paragraph
Ctrl+→
Right to the start (first letter) of the next word
Ctrl+←
Left to the start (first letter) of the previous word
You can use either set of arrow keys on the computer keyboard, but when
using the numeric keypad, ensure that the Num Lock light is off. Do this by
pressing the Num Lock key. If you don’t, you see numbers in your text rather
than the insertion pointer dancing all over — like444this.
Moving from beginning to end
The insertion pointer also bows to pressure from those cursor keys without
arrows on them. The first couple is End and Home, which move the insertion
pointer to the start or end of things, depending on how End and Home are
used:
Key or Combination
To Whisk the Insertion Pointer . . .
End
To the end of a line of text
Home
To the start of a line of text
Ctrl+End
To the very end of the document
Ctrl+Home
To the tippy-top of the document
The peculiar cases of PgUp and PgDn
One would think, logically, that the Page Up or PgUp key moves a document
up one page and that the Page Down or PgDn key moves a document down.
’Tain’t so, though. Rather than slide your document around a page at a time,
these keys move things one screen at a time:
51
Chapter 4: Moving Around a Document Hither, Thither, and Yon

PgUp
The PgUp key moves the insertion pointer up one
screen. Or, if you’re looking at the tippy-top of your doc-
ument, pressing this key moves the insertion pointer to
the start of the document.
PgDn
The PgDn key moves the insertion pointer down one
screen or to the end of the document, if you happen to
be near there.
If the functions of PgUp and PgDn aren’t confusing enough, you can absorb
these two combinations, which are just this side of pressing all the keys on
the keyboard at one time:
Ctrl+Alt+PgUp
Moves the cursor to the top of the current screen.
Ctrl+Alt+PgDn
Moves the cursor to the bottom of the current screen.
Ctrl+PgUp and Ctrl+PgDn? Yup, they’re used in Word, but not as you would
expect. Refer to the following section for the details.
Using Browse Buttons to Navigate
Lurking at the bottom of the vertical scroll bar are three buttons, as shown in
the margin. These browse buttons allow you to scroll through your document
in leaps and bounds of various sizes.
The top button is the Browse Up button, which is linked to the Ctrl+PgUp key
combination.
The bottom button is the Browse Down button, which is linked to the
Ctrl+PgDn key combination.
The center button is the What-the-heck-am-I-browsing-for? button, which is
linked to the Alt+Ctrl+Home key combination.
When you click the center button, a pop-up palette of things to browse for
appears, as shown in Figure 4-3. Pointing the mouse at any one of the items
displays text that explains the item in the bottom part of the palette.
Figure 4-3:
Various
things to
browse for.
52
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Unless you’ve chosen another item from the browsing palette (refer to
Figure 4-3), the browse buttons (and Ctrl+PgUp and Ctrl+PgDn) leap through
your document by full pages.
Whenever an option other than Page is chosen from the browsing palette, the
browse buttons change color. So, when the buttons are black, you know that
you’re browsing by page. When the browse buttons turn blue, they’re search-
ing for something else. (Alas, the browsing palette doesn’t tell you which
option is currently chosen.)
Getting Lost and Going Back
With all the various commands for moving the insertion pointer, it’s quite pos-
sible to make a mistake and not know where you are in a document. Yea, verily,
the insertion pointer has gone where no insertion pointer has gone before.
Rather than click your heels together three times and try to get back the
wishful way, just remember this keyboard combination:
Shift+F5
Pressing the Shift+F5 keys forces Word to return you to the last spot you
edited. You can do this up to three times before the cycle repeats. But the
first time should get you back to where you were before you got lost.
 The Shift+F5 command is the same as the Browse by Edits option, found
on the Browse palette. Refer to the preceding section.
 Sadly, the Shift+F5 keyboard shortcut works only in Word; you can’t use
this command in real life.
Go to Wherever with the Go To Command
Word’s Go To command allows you to send the insertion pointer to a specific
page or line or to the location of a number of interesting things Word can
potentially cram into your document. The Go To command is your word pro-
cessing teleporter to anywhere.
Press the Ctrl+G key combination to see the Go To tab portion of the Find and
Replace dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-4.

Chapter 4: Moving Around a Document Hither, Thither, and Yon

Choose what to go to, such as a page, from the scrolling list on the left side of
the dialog box. Then type the relevant information, such as a page number, in
the box on the right side of the dialog box. Click the Go To button to go to
that location.
For example, type 14 in the box and press Enter, and you go to page 14 — if
you have a page 14 to go to.
 You can also summon the Go To command by double-clicking the page
number on the status bar.
 Note that you can go to a page relative to the current page. For example,
to go three pages forward, choose Page and type +3. To go 12 pages
backward, type -12 in the box.

hat is editing? At its best, editing is making the stuff you write read
better. A good editor helps a writer perfect his words, guiding him in a
way that avoids the ambiguous, keeps the pace tight, completes thoughts,
checks this weird thing called “subject-verb agreement,” and, above all,
ensures that the writer’s intention is best understood by the reader.
Okay. I got that off my chest. Now, deep down in that secret place where you
hide your desire to jump on the couch and run with scissors, as a writer you
resent editing. That’s because at its core, editing is about deleting text.
Despite all good intentions, the editor is at her best when she’s slashing, snip-
ping, cutting, gouging, severing, goring, obliterating, and replacing those oh-
so-vital words you poured your soul into and struggled over for hours. It’s
hard to accept (even more so because the editor will say that it’s difficult to
accept), but it’s true: Editing text is about deleting stuff, which is also the
subject of this chapter. Or this chapter’s subject. Whatever.
A good editor also checks your document’s spelling and grammar. See
Chapter 8 for more information.
Deleting Stuff
Credit the guy who put the eraser on the end of the pencil: It’s a given that
human beings make mistakes. The round, soft eraser counterbalances the
sharp point of the pencil in more ways than one.

When the typewriter was at its peak, the ability to erase or untype text was a
popular feature. And, of course, even now — years after the typewriter has
been consigned to the curiosity corner of the public library — people still
know what WiteOut is and why it was a necessity.
On just about every front, the ability to erase text is just as valuable as the
ability to create that text. The same holds true with your word processor.
Deleting is part of the creation process, part of thinking and rethinking, and
part of self-editing. Writing. Deleting. Rewriting. Redeleting. That’s how it goes!
The delete keys: Backspace and Delete
Both creating and destroying text are accomplished by using the computer
keyboard. The majority of keys are used to create text. Only two keys delete
text: Backspace and Delete. How these keys work, and how much of your text
they can delete, depends on how the keys are used.
Deleting single characters
By themselves, the Backspace and Delete keys are used to delete single char-
acters of text:
 Backspace key: Deletes the character to the left of the insertion pointer
 Delete key: Deletes the character to the right of the insertion pointer
In the following example, the insertion pointer is “flashing” (okay, it would be
flashing on a computer screen) between the h and the a in that. Pressing the
Backspace key deletes the h; pressing the Delete key deletes the a.
No one would have suspected th|at you were a robot,
Hubert, until you began to articulate your love for
the waffle iron.
 After you delete a character, any text to the right or below the character
shuffles over to fill the void.
 You can press and hold Backspace or Delete to continuously “machine-
gun-delete” characters. Release the key to halt such wanton destruction,
although I recommend using other delete commands (covered in this
chapter) rather than the machine-gun approach.
 Special types of text in Word cannot easily be deleted using either the
Backspace or Delete key. An example is an updating text field, which is
special text that always shows, say, today’s date. This type of text
appears shaded in a light gray color when you try to delete it. That’s
Word reminding you of the unusualness of the text. Press the Delete or
Backspace key again to delete such text.
56
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Deleting a word
To gobble up an entire word, add the Ctrl key to the Backspace or Delete
key’s destructive power:
 Ctrl+Backspace deletes the word in front (to the left) of the insertion
pointer.
 Ctrl+Delete deletes the word behind (to the right) of the insertion
pointer.
These keyboard shortcuts work best when the insertion pointer is at the
start or end of a word. When you’re in the middle of the word, the commands
delete only from that middle point to the start or end of the word.
After you delete a word, the insertion pointer sits at the end of the preceding
word (or paragraph) when you use Ctrl+Backspace. Deleting a word with
Ctrl+Delete puts the cursor at the beginning of the next word. This is done to
facilitate the rapid deletion of several words in a row.
After deleting the text, Word neatly wraps up the remaining text, snuggling it
together in a grammatically proper way.
No mere pencil eraser can match Ctrl+Delete or Ctrl+Backspace for sheer
speed and terror!
Deleting more than a word
Beyond deleting a word or character, Word lacks keyboard-specific commands
to delete lines or paragraphs of text. There are ways to delete these things —
they’re just not obvious. Before going into the details, first come some
definitions:
 A line of text is merely a line across the page (not really a grammatical
thing).
 A sentence is a sentence. You know: Start with a capital letter and end
with a period, question mark, or exclamation point. You probably
learned this concept in grammar school, which is why they call it gram-
mar school anyway.
 A paragraph is one or more sentences, or a heading, ending with a press
of the Enter key.
 A page of text is just that — all the text from where the page starts to
where the page ends.
57
Chapter 5: Editing Text

Word can also delete odd-size chunks of text by marking that text as a block.
Refer to Chapter 7 for more information on blocks of text.
Deleting a line of text
The easiest way to delete a line of text is to use the mouse:
1. Move the mouse into the left margin of your document.
You know you’ve found the sweet spot when the mouse pointer changes
into a northeast arrow.
2. Point the mouse pointer arrow at the line of text you want to obliterate.
3. Click the mouse.
The line of text is highlighted, or selected.
4. Press the Delete key to send that line into the void.
Deleting a sentence
Making a sentence go bye-bye is cinchy:
1. Point the mouse at the offending sentence.
2. Press and hold the Ctrl key and click the mouse.
The sentence is selected.
3. Press the Delete key.
Oomph! It’s gone.
Deleting a paragraph
The fastest way to delete a full paragraph:
1. Point the mouse at the paragraph.
2. Click the mouse button thrice.
Thrice means “three times.”
3. Press the Delete key.
If clicking thrice is befuddling you, move the mouse pointer into the left
margin next to the offending paragraph. When the mouse pointer changes to
a northeasterly-pointing arrow, click twice. That selects the entire paragraph,
which you can now whack by pressing the Delete key.
58
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Deleting a page
Pages aren’t something that Word deals with offhand. In fact, pages are really
a printer thing. Even so, to delete a page, mind these steps:
1. Go to the top of the page you want to delete.
Refer to Chapter 4 for information on the Go To command. In the Go To
dialog box, specify the number of the page to delete. (Remember to click
the Close button to banish the Find and Replace dialog box.)
2. Press the F8 key.
The F8 key is used to enter a special selection mode in Word, which I
cover in detail in Chapter 7.
3. Press Ctrl+PgDn.
The insertion pointer moves to the bottom of the page.
4. Press the Delete key.
The page is gone.
Refer to Chapter 10 for special information on deleting that annoying extra
blank page at the end of your document.
Splitting and Joining
Editing can also involve the basic chores of splitting and joining lines or para-
graphs of text. To split is to make two paragraphs where once there was one.
To join is to make one paragraph where once there were two.
Making two paragraphs from one
To split a single paragraph in twain, locate the point where you want them to
break — say, between two sentences. Move the insertion pointer to that loca-
tion, and then press the Enter key. Word splits the paragraph in two; the text
above the insertion pointer becomes its own paragraph, and the text follow-
ing it then becomes the next paragraph.
Depending on where you placed the insertion pointer, you may need to delete
an extra space at the beginning of the second paragraph or at the end of the
first paragraph.
59
Chapter 5: Editing Text

Making one paragraph from two
To join two paragraphs and turn them into one, you delete the Enter charac-
ter between the paragraphs. To do that, move the insertion pointer to the
start of the second paragraph, and then press the Backspace key. Removing
the Enter character joins two paragraphs. (You may need to add a space
between the newly joined paragraphs.)
Splitting lines with a soft return
The Enter key inserts a hard return into your text to end a paragraph. To end
a line of text without ending a paragraph, a soft return is used instead. This is
done by pressing Shift+Enter.
The soft return, or line break, is used primarily in titles and headings. For
example, when you have a long title and need to split it up between two lines,
you press Shift+Enter to insert the soft return. For example, type this line:
Filbert & Hazel
Press Shift+Enter. A new line starts. Continue typing:
A Couple of Nuts
The soft return keeps the title text together (in the same paragraph), but on
separate lines.
Mistakes? Mistakes? Undo 
Them with Haste
That quaffing and drinking will undo you.
— Twelfth Night, William Shakespeare
There’s no need to be afraid of obliterating your text, or of doing anything
else in Word. Anything! That’s because Word sports a handy Undo command.
What you can do, you can also undo.
60
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Now mark me, how I will undo myself
The Undo command undoes anything you do in Word, which includes format-
ting text, moving blocks, typing and deleting text, formatting — the whole
lasagna. You have two handy ways to unleash the Undo command:
 Press Ctrl+Z.
 Click the Undo command button on the Quick Access toolbar.
I prefer using the Ctrl+Z key combination, but an advantage of the Undo com-
mand button is that it sports a drop-down menu that helps you review the
past several things you’ve done, or that can be undone.
 Word’s Undo command is handy, but don’t use it as an excuse to be
sloppy!
 Regrettably, you cannot pick and choose from the Undo command
button’s drop-down menu; the menu merely allows you to undo multiple
instances of things all at one time.
 There are sporadic times when Undo doesn’t work. Before this happens,
Word warns you. For example, you may see a message such as “There is
not enough memory to undo this operation, Continue?” Proceed at your
own peril.
 The Undo command doesn’t work when there’s nothing to undo, or if
something just cannot be undone. For example, you cannot undo a 
save-to-disk operation.
 To undo an Undo, choose Redo. See the next section.
Redo, the Undo-Undo command
If you undo something and — whoops! — you didn’t mean to, you must use
the Redo command to set things back. For example, you may type some text
and then use Undo to “untype” the text. You can use the Redo command to
get the typing back. You have two choices:
 Press Ctrl+Y.
 Click the Redo command button on the Quick Access toolbar.
61
Chapter 5: Editing Text

The Redo command serves two functions. First, it does exactly the opposite
of whatever the Undo command does. So, if you type text, Undo untypes the
text, and Redo recovers the text. If you use Undo to recover deleted text,
Redo deletes the text again. (The second function is covered in the next
section.)
Redo, the Repeat Typing command
When the Redo command has nothing left to redo, it changes functions and
becomes the Repeat Typing command. Boy, can the Repeat Typing command
be a real timesaver!
62
Part II: Word Processing Basics 
For the few who are fond of Overtype mode
The writing you do in Word is in Insert mode,
which means that any new text you type is
inserted just before the blinking insertion pointer.
The new stuff pushes any existing text to the
right and downward as you type. This is Insert
mode. But things don’t always have to work that
way.
Insert mode’s evil twin is Overtype mode. In
Overtype mode, all the text you type overwrites
the existing text and replaces it as you go. The
new text you type literally types over (overtypes)
the existing text, all except for the Enter key; you
cannot overtype from one paragraph to the next.
I don’t recommend writing in Overtype mode;
Insert mode is fine. All the Word documentation,
all the Microsoft Office Word Help, and this
book assume that Insert mode is what you’re
using. Still, if you insist, to activate Overtype
mode, heed these steps:
1. Choose Word Options from the Office
Button menu.
2. Click Advanced from the list on the left side
of the Word Options dialog box.
3. Put a check mark by the item on the right
labeled Use Overtype Mode.
4. I also recommend putting a check mark by
the item above it, Use the Insert key to
Control Overtype Mode.
5. Click OK.
No visual clue or message on the screen
informs you when Overtype mode is active; you
merely know that you’re in Overtype mode
because any new text you type replaces the
existing text. Use the Insert or Ins key to switch
between Overtype and Insert modes.

For example, type the following lines in Word:
Knock, knock.
Who’s there?
Knock.
Knock who?
Now press Ctrl+Y or choose the Repeat Typing command button from the
Quick Access toolbar. Word repeats the last few things you typed. (If you had
to press the Backspace key to back up and erase, Ctrl+Y repeats only from
that point on.)
 The Repeat Typing command can also used to reapply formatting. When
you’re working through a document and changing styles on various
chunks of text, using the Repeat key or Redo command can save oodles
of time, especially in applying formatting. (See Part III of this book for
information on formatting.)
 If you can remember the F4 key, it works the same as Ctrl+Y; both are
the Repeat Typing command keys.

magine being able to combine the power of the computer with the ancient
practice of alchemy. Computers are excellent at being obedient; they don’t
mind doing any task, even the most boring, repetitive things. Alchemy had as
its goal the transmutation of lead into gold. Now, combine the two so that the
computer, which can easily find the single word needle in a haystack of docu-
ments, has the ability to change that word needle into the word gold, and you
have a quick and potentially misleading introduction to the powerful yet
basic word processing ability of search and replace.
Search and replace is one of the most basic and ancient word processor 
functions. In Word, it’s known as Find and Replace (don’t ask me why), and 
it consists of two features: The first feature involves searching up or down
through a document for a tidbit of text, and the second adds the ability to
change that tidbit of text and replace it with something else.
Text Happily Found
Finding text is the domain of the Editing group, found on the far right end of
the Home tab on Word’s Ribbon interface. The Editing group may appear in
its full glory, as shown in Figure 6-1, or it may simply appear as an Editing
button. When it’s a button, you must click that button first to see the palette
of commands, which (surprisingly) looks like what’s shown in Figure 6-1.

O villainous text tidbit! Seek it out!
Locating text in your document is a snap, whether it’s a protracted diatribe
or the tiniest monosyllabic utterance. Either way, the Find command stands
ready to tackle the task. Abide by these steps:
1. On the Home tab, click the big Find button in the Editing group.
Refer to Figure 6-1; sometimes you may have to click the Editing button
to get to the Find button. If all else fails, use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+F.
Clicking the Find button summons the Find and Replace dialog box, 
illustrated in Figure 6-2.
2. Type the text you want to find into the Find What box.
Be exact. For example, if you want to find yourself, type yourself — no
period or spaces or quotes. Type only the text you’re looking for.
3. Click the Find Next button to start the search.
Or, you can just press Enter.
Word searches for the text you typed, starting from the insertion pointer’s
location to the end of the document. If any text is found, it’s highlighted
(or selected) onscreen, and the insertion pointer moves to that location in
your document. At that point, you can click the Cancel button to make the
Find and Replace dialog box go away.

and Replace
dialog box.

66
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

 The Find and Replace dialog box may already display text in the Find
What box. If so, you can delete that text by pressing the Backspace key.
 Do not end the text with a period unless you want to find the period too.
 The Find command can find things that you can’t readily type in, such as
the Tab or Enter key. See the section “Finding stuff you can’t type in,”
later in this chapter.
 If you’re not sure whether the text is typed in uppercase or lowercase
letters, use lowercase.
 If the text isn’t found, you may be asked to search “at the beginning,” which
means the beginning of the document. Click the Yes button to do so.
 If the text isn’t found and you’re certain that it’s in there, check your
spelling. If that’s okay, try searching for a single word rather than two or
more words or a sentence.
 Word finds text only in the current document (the one you see on the
screen). To find text in another document, click that document’s button
on the taskbar and try searching again.
 To find an additional occurrence of the text, click the Find Next button.
 You can use the drop-down arrow gizmo (to the right of the Find What
text box) to display a scrolling list of text you’ve previously searched for.
To search again for a bit of text you’ve already searched for, click the
drop-down arrow and click the text you want to find again. Click the Find
Next button, and Word frantically begins searching.
 You can limit the Find command’s scope (the range of text it searches
through) by marking text as a block. See Chapter 7 for block info.
 After using the Find command, you can use the Browse Down button to
continue your finding foray. Simply close the Find and Replace dialog
box, and then click the Browse Down button (or press Ctrl+PgDn). So, if
you’ve already searched for and found crap, clicking the Browse Down
button finds even more crap.
The Super Find command
On a simple level, the Find command hunts down chunks and chunklettes of
text. Yet the Find command is far more powerful than that. You can use the
Find command to find text exactly as it’s typed, text you cannot type, format-
ting commands, and just about anything in a document. Yes, it’s still the same
Find command, but it’s more.
67
Chapter 6: Find and Replace

To unveil the Super Find command, beckon forth the Find and Replace dialog
box (press Ctrl+F). Click the More button. The Find and Replace dialog box
gets taller, with a bunch of options and doodads at the bottom, as illustrated
in Figure 6-3.
The following sections tell you why you may want to mess with some of the
doodads in the Find More dialog box.
Finding an exact bit of text
There’s a difference between Curt and curt. One is a name, and the other is
being rude and abrupt. To use the Find command to find one and not the
other, select the Match Case option under Search Options. That way, Curt
matches only words that start with an uppercase C and have lowercase urt in
them.
Finding a whole word
The Find Whole Words Only option allows you to look for words such as right
and set without also finding words like alright and upset.
Finding text that you know only a small part of (by using wildcards)
Here’s a can-o-worms for you. It’s possible to use wildcards to find words that
you know only a part of, or a group of words with similar letters. This trick is
a highly technical operation, so I advise you not to drive or operate heavy
machinery when reading the following text.
Figure 6-3:
The more
detailed
Find and
Replace
dialog box.
68
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

The two basic wildcard characters are ? and *, where ? represents any single
letter and * represents a group of letters. Suppose that you type the following
line in the Find What box:
?up
If you select the Use Wildcards option (in the More part of the Super Find and
Replace dialog box), Word searches for any three-letter word that starts with
any old letter but must end with “you pee” — cup, pup, and sup, for example.
The asterisk finds a group of characters, so the following wildcard locates
any word starting with w and ending with s (there are lots of them):
w*s
Finding text that sounds like something else
The Sounds Like (English) option allows you to search for homonyms, or
words that sound the same as the search word. You know: their and there
or deer and dear or hear and here. How this is useful, I’ll never know.
Oh! This isn’t a rhyming search command. If you try to use it to find everything
that rhymes with Doris, for example, it doesn’t find Boris, chorus, pylorus, or
anything of the like.
Finding variations of a word
Thanks to global warming, the protagonist in your novel no longer walks
across an isthmus; he swims. And that’s some journey! To make Word search
for every variation of walk (walking, walked, and so on), type walk in the
Find What box and select the Find All Word Forms (English) option in the
Search Options area.
Searching this way or that
When I’d lose things as a kid, my mom would say “Retrace your steps!”
This wisdom can be applied in Word as well, where the Find command can
be directed to look not only forward through a document, but backwards as
well. The secret is found in the Search drop-down list in the More part of the
Find and Replace dialog box:
 All: When this option is chosen, Find searches the entire document, from
the insertion pointer’s location down to the end of the document, back
up to the beginning, and then back to the toothpick cursor’s location.
 Down: Find searches from the toothpick cursor’s location to the end of
your document, and then it stops.
 Up: Find searches from the toothpick cursor’s location to the start of
your document, backward. Then it stops.
69
Chapter 6: Find and Replace

You can also use the Browse buttons to repeat the Find command up or
down, depending on which Browse button you press.
Finding stuff you can’t type in
There are things you can search for in a document, things that just cannot
be typed at the keyboard. No, I’m not talking about nasty things; this isn’t
a censorship issue. Instead, I’m referring to things like tabs, Enter keys 
(paragraphs), page breaks, graphics, and other, similar non-typable things.
To find a special, unprintable character, click the More button to see the
superdooper Find and Replace dialog box (refer to Figure 6-3), and then click
the Special button. Up pops a list of various things Word can search for but
that you would have a dickens of a time typing, similar to what’s shown in
Figure 6-4.
Naturally, the items on the list may not be recognizable to you. That figures.
There are 22 things on the list, and I’ve used maybe 6 of them myself. Here
are some of the handier things you can use from the Special pop-up menu:
 Any Character, Any Digit, and Any Letter are special characters that
represent, well, just about anything. These items can be used as wild-
cards for matching lots of stuff.
Figure 6-4:
Items to
search for
that you
can’t type.
70
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

 Caret Character allows you to search for a caret (^) symbol, which is
a special character. If you type just the caret symbol itself (^), Word
thinks that you’re trying to type something special, as covered later
in this section.
 Paragraph Mark (¶) is a special character that’s the same as the Enter
character — what you press to end a paragraph.
 Tab Character is the character that moves the cursor to the next tab mark.
 White Space is any number of blank characters: one or more spaces,
tabs, empty lines, or a combination of each one.
Choose one of the items from the list to search for that special character.
When you do, a special, funky shorthand representation for that character
(such as ^t for Tab) appears in the Find What box. Click the Find Next button
to find that character.
 To search for the Enter key press, which marks the end of a paragraph,
choose Paragraph Mark. To search for the paragraph character, ¶, choose
Paragraph Character.
 Yes, you can mix special characters with plain text. For example, to find a
Tab character followed by Hunter, you use the Special button to insert the
tab character (^t on the screen), and then type Hunter. It looks like this:
^tHunter
 It’s possible, although nerdy, to type the special characters manually.
Although this method avoids using the Special menu, which can be big
and baffling, it means that you need to memorize the character codes.
Each one starts with the caret character, ^, and some of them are logical,
such as ^p for Paragraph Mark (Enter) or ^t for Tab. Here are a few other
handy shortcuts, for reference:

Chapter 6: Find and Replace

Finding formatting
In its most powerful superhero mode, the Find command can scour your 
document for formatting information. For example, if you want to find only
those instances of the word lie in boldface type, you can do that. Before you
attempt this task, I recommend that you understand Word’s formatting abilities
and commands, which are covered in Part III of this book.
The formatting options you can search for are revealed to you with a click
of the Format button, which appears in the Find and Replace dialog box
when the More button is clicked (refer to Figure 6-3). Clicking the Format
button displays a pop-up menu of Word’s primary formatting commands, as
shown in Figure 6-5. Choosing any item from that list displays a correspond-
ing dialog box, from which you can choose the formatting attributes to
search for.
Suppose that you want to find a large goose egg in your document. Follow
these steps:
1. Summon the Find and Replace dialog box.
Pressing Ctrl+F is the only sane way to do this step.
2. Type goose egg in the Find What box.
3. If needed, click the More button to display the bottom part of the Find
and Replace dialog box.
4. If the No Formatting button is available, then click it.
This button is used to clear any previous formatting attributes you may
have searched for. If the button can be clicked, click it to clear out those
attributes and start over afresh.
5. Click the Format button.
Figure 6-5:
Various

72
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

6. Choose Font from the pop-up list.
The Find Font dialog box appears, which is where you set or control var-
ious text attributes. Say that the large goose egg you’re searching for is
24 points tall.
7. Choose 24 from the Size list.
Look in the upper-right corner of the Find Font dialog box.
8. Click OK.
The Font dialog box goes away, and you return to the Find and Replace
dialog box.
Notice the text just beneath the Find What box. It says Format: Font:
24 pt. That text is telling you that Word is now geared up to find only
text that is 24 points tall — about twice the normal size.
9. Click the Find Next button to find your formatted text.
If you want to search only for a format, leave the Find What text box blank
(refer to Step 2). That way, you can search for formatting attributes without
caring what the text reads.
 To find specific text attributes (bold or underline, for example), use the
Find Font dialog box to choose those attributes.
 You can use this technique to look for specific occurrences of a font,
such as Courier or Times New Roman, by selecting the font from
the selection list. Scroll through the font menu to see what you can
choose.
 You can also search for paragraph formatting, such as an indented para-
graph, by choosing Paragraph rather than Font from the Format pop-up
list in the Find and Replace dialog box.
 Yes, you can search for more than one formatting attribute at a time.
Just keep choosing format options from the Format button.
 Word remembers your formatting options! The next time you want
to search for plain text, you need to click the No Formatting button.
Doing so removes the formatting options and allows you to search
for text in any format. After you forget to do this a few times, you
get really heated up that Word cannot find your text. Do not forget
to click the No Formatting button to return Word to normal text-
finding mode!

Chapter 6: Find and Replace

Replacing What’s Been Found
The true power behind the Find command is not only its ability to find text
but also to replace that text with something else. Call it alchemy, but it works!
The key is the Replace command. With it, you can turn lead into gold, change
Peoria into Pocatello, or Lance Beauchamp, the multimillionaire playboy and
international financier, into Paula Dowd, the renowned psychic and horticul-
turalist. Here’s how you do that, and more:
1. On the Home tab, click the Replace command button, found in the
Editing group on the far right side.
When the Replace command button isn’t visible in the Editing group
(refer to Figure 6-1), click the Editing button, and then choose the
Replace command button from the pop-up group of command buttons
that appears.
Choosing the Replace command button displays the Find and Replace
dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-6. This place should be familiar if you’ve
been using the Find command. After all, finding stuff is the first part of
using Find and Replace.
2. In the Find What box, type the text you want to find.
This is the text you want to replace with something else. So, if you’re
finding Lance and replacing him with Paula, type Lance.
Press the Tab key when you’re done typing.
3. In the Replace With box, type the text you want to use to replace the
original text.
To continue from the example in Step 2, you type Paula here.
4. Click the Find Next button.
Figure 6-6:
The Replace
part of the
Find and
Replace
dialog box.
74
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

At this point, the Replace command works just like the Find command:
Word scours your document for the text you typed in the Find What
dialog box. When that text is found, you move on to Step 5; otherwise,
the Replace command fails because there’s nothing to replace.
5. Click the Replace button.
Word replaces the found text, highlighted on-screen, with the text typed
in the Replace With box.
6. Keep replacing.
After you click the Replace button, Word immediately searches for the
next instance of the text, at which point you keep repeating Step 5 until
the entire document has been searched.
7. Read the summary that’s displayed.
After the last bit of text is replaced, a dialog box appears and lists a sum-
mary for you. For example, it might say “Word has completed its search of
the document and has made 9 replacements.” Of course, the number of
replacements depends on what you were searching for and yadda-yadda.
8. Click the Close button.
You’re done!
 All the restrictions, options, and rules for the Find command also apply
to finding and replacing text. Refer to the section “Text Happily Found,”
at the start of this chapter.
 The keyboard shortcut for the Replace command is Ctrl+H. Huh? Yeah,
Ctrl+H. There’s no way to remember it, other than if you look at the com-
puter keyboard, you see that the F, G and H keys appear next to each
other, and Ctrl+F, Ctrl+G, and Ctrl+H all summon the same dialog box.
Coincidence? Honestly!
 The Replace command’s dialog box also sports a More button, which
can be used exactly as the More button for the Find command. See the
section “The Super Find command,” earlier in this chapter.
 Word may find your text in the middle of another word, such as use in
causes. Oops! Click the More button and select the Find Whole Words
Only option to prevent such a thing from happening.
 If you don’t type anything in the Replace With box, Word replaces your
text with nothing! It’s wanton destruction!
 Speaking of wanton destruction, the Undo command restores your docu-
ment to its preceding condition if you foul up the Replace operation. See
Chapter 5 for more information.
75
Chapter 6: Find and Replace

The miracle of the Replace All button
The steps in the previous section work well to find and replace tidbits of text
to and fro in your document. But it can often be tedious to keep pressing that
Replace button over and over. That’s why the Replace command’s dialog box
sports a handy Replace All button.
The Replace All button directs the Replace command to find all instances of
the Find What text and — without question — replace it with the Replace
With text. To use this button, simply click the Replace All button in Step 5 in
the previous section. Then skip to Step 8.
Finding and replacing formatting
Just as the Find command can search for text with specific formatting, you
can use the Replace command to replace text and apply formatting or to
replace one type of formatting with another. Needless to say, this process
can be very tricky: Not only do I recommend that you be familiar with Word’s
formatting commands, but you should also be well-practiced in using the
Replace command.
Suppose that you want to replace all instances of underlined text with italic.
Underlined text reeks so much of typewriter, and that’s just too 20th century
for these modern times. By replacing underline with italic, you’re searching
for one text format and replacing it with another; you’re not searching for
text at all. So, be careful. Do this:
1. Press Ctrl+H to summon the Find and Replace dialog box.
2. Click the More button, if necessary, to display the full dialog box.
3. Click to select any text in the Find What box, and then delete that text
by pressing the Backspace key.
4. Click the Format button and choose Font from the pop-up menu that
appears.
The Find Font dialog box appears.
5. In the Find Font dialog box, choose the single underline graphic from
the Underline style drop-down list.
6. Click OK.
Back in the Find and Replace dialog box, the text Format: Underline
should appear before the Find What box.
76
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

7. Click to select any text in the Replace With box and press Backspace
to delete that text.
8. Choose Font from the Format button’s pop-up list.
9. In the Find Font dialog box, choose Italic from the Font Style list.
10. Click OK to close the Find Font dialog box.
Below the Replace With box, it should say Format: Font: Italic.
11. Click the Replace All button.
Word scours your document and replaces any underlined text with
italic.
12. Click OK when the find-and-replace is done.
As long as you set things up carefully, searching and replacing text formatting
is a quick and easy way to spiff up a boring document.
 To replace one format with another, such as underline with italic, be
sure to leave the Find What and Replace With text boxes empty. That
way, only the text formatting is replaced.
 An easier way to update formatting in a document is to use and apply
styles. Refer to Chapter 16 for details.
 Don’t forget about the No Formatting button! You need to click it if you
want to change the formats or replace text without paying attention to
formats.

W
riting involves blocks. This began with the ancient Egyptians, who
perfected writing on blocks, quite literally. Entire epochs were pre-
sented on a wall of stone. When the ancient Egyptian editor arrived, she
would point out problems in the wall, so the writer would have to replace
some blocks of text or move other blocks around. And if the writer hesitated,
the editor would hit him over the head with what would then become the
writer’s block. It was quite an ingenious system.
As writing moved to paper, working with blocks became obtuse. Thanks to
the invention of scissors and rubber cement, it was possible to cut and paste
blocks of text, but the result was sloppy. Often the writer would play with the
rubber cement, rolling it into tiny balls to flick at the back of the editor’s head
when she wasn’t looking. The system was quite awkward.

Only with the dawn of the word processor has working with blocks returned
to its Stone Age glory. Word lets you rope off any random chunk of text —
a word, sentence, paragraph, or more — and mark that chunk as a block.
You can then do amazing things with that block of text, things that are cov-
ered in this chapter. Yes, it’s time once again to play with blocks.
What Is a Block of Text?
A block of text is simply some portion of text in your document, from a single
character to the entire document. The block has a beginning and an end, and
the block itself consists of all the text between.
You create a block by selecting text. Selecting is done by using the keyboard,
the mouse, or various other text-selection techniques covered in this chapter.
On the screen, the block appears highlighted, as shown in Figure 7-1.
By marking off text as a block, you can perform certain actions, or use vari-
ous Word commands, that affect only the text in that block. Or, you can copy
or move the block of text. It’s all covered later in this chapter as well as in
other places throughout this book. Indeed, blocks are handy things to use in
a word processor.
Figure 7-1:
A block of
text is

80
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

 A block of text in Word includes all the letters and characters and the
text formatting.
 Graphics and other nontext elements can also be selected as a block. In
fact, you can select graphics along with text in the same block.
 When the status bar is displaying a word count, the number of words
selected in the block of text is displayed, next to the total number of
words in the document. (Refer to Figure 7-1.)
 When the Find command locates text, that text is selected as a block.
Refer to Chapter 6 for more information on the Find command.
 Selecting text also means selecting characters such as tabs and the
Enter key press that marks the end of a paragraph. Fortunately, Word
shows the Enter “character” as an extra blank space at the end of a para-
graph. When you select that blank, you select the whole paragraph as a
paragraph. To avoid selecting the Enter character, don’t select the blank
space at the end of a paragraph.
Marking a Chunk of Text As a Block
Word offers you many ways to mark text as a block in your document.
This section mulls over the possibilities.
Using the keyboard to select text
The secret to using the keyboard to select text is the Shift key. By holding down
the Shift key, you can use the standard keyboard commands that move the inser-
tion pointer to select blocks of text. Table 7-1 has some suggestions for you.

81
Chapter 7: Text Blocks, Stumbling Blocks, Writer’s Blocks

You can use any keyboard cursor-movement command (they’re listed in
Chapter 4), but I recommend using this Shift key method for selecting only
small chunks of text. Otherwise, you may end up tying your fingers into knots!
Either Shift key works, although I prefer to use the left Shift key and then
work the arrow keys on the right side of the keyboard.
Marking a block with the mouse
Forget cheese. The computer mouse was born to mark text, by selecting vast
swaths of words with a wide sweep of your hand, by clicking a number of
times, or by using the old point-and-stretch routine. Mickey may rule a king-
dom, but your computer mouse rules over selecting text in your computer.
Dragging over text to select it
The most common way to select text is by using the computer mouse thus:
1. Point the mouse at the start of the text block.
2. Drag the mouse over the text you want to select.
As you drag, text becomes highlighted, or selected. (Refer to Figure 7-1.)
3. Release the mouse — stop the dragging — to mark the end of the block.
You can use these steps to select any old size of block in your document.
82
Part II: Word Processing Basics 
Out, damn Mini Toolbar!
When the mouse is used to select text, Word
displays the Mini Toolbar, looking like this:
The Mini Toolbar is a palette of common format-
ting commands that Word supposes you need for
a quick-format on that selected text. After initially
disliking the Mini Toolbar, I’ve grown to enjoy it.
But I recognize that you may find the Mini
Toolbar more annoying than useful. If so, you
can suppress its display. Follow these steps:
1. Choose the Word Options command from
the Office Button menu.
2. Choose Popular from the list on the left side
of the Word Options window.
3. Remove the check mark by the item Show
Mini Toolbar on Selection.
4. Click OK.
If you would rather not eternally banish the Mini
Toolbar, note that it hides itself whenever you
move the mouse beyond the selected chunk
of text.

 This selection technique works best when you use the mouse to drag
over only the text you can actually see on the screen. When you try to
select text beyond what you see on the screen, you have to select and
scroll — which can be unwieldy; the mouse scrolls the text up and down
quickly, and, well, things get out of hand.
 When you find yourself becoming frustrated over not selecting all or
part of a word, refer to the later sidebar “Would you rather select text by
letter or by word?”
Selecting text by clicking the mouse
A speedy way to select specific sizes of chunks of text is to match the power
of the mouse with the dexterity of your index finger. Table 7-2 explains some
clicking-and-selecting techniques worth noting.
Table 7-2
Mouse Selection Arcana
To Select This 
Click the Mouse Thus
Chunk of Text
A single word
Point at the word with your mouse and double-click.
A line
Move the mouse pointer into the left margin beside the line you
want to select. The mouse pointer changes to a northeastward-
pointing arrow. Click the mouse to select a line of text, or drag the
mouse up or down to select several lines.
A sentence
Point the mouse at the sentence and Ctrl+click. (Press the Ctrl key
and click the mouse.)
A paragraph
Point the mouse somewhere in the paragraph’s midst and triple-click.
The old poke-and-point method of selecting
Here’s the best way to select a chunk of text of any size, especially when that
chunk of text is larger than what you can see on the screen at once:
1. Click the mouse to set the insertion pointer where you want the block
to start — the anchor point.
2. Scroll through your document using the scroll bar.
You must use the scroll bar to scroll through your document. If you use
the cursor-movement keys, you reposition the insertion pointer, which
isn’t what you want.
3. To mark the end of the block, press and hold the Shift key and click
the mouse where you want the block to end.
The text from the insertion pointer to wherever you clicked the mouse is
selected as a block.
83
Chapter 7: Text Blocks, Stumbling Blocks, Writer’s Blocks

Using the F8 key to mark a block
If you can remember that the F8 key on the computer’s keyboard can be used
to mark text, you can exploit one of the seldom-used and most powerful text-
marking tools that Word has to offer.
Yes, wacky as it sounds, the F8 key is used to mark a block of text. Pressing
the F8 key once enters extended selection mode. That’s where Word drops
anchor at the insertion pointer’s location and then lets you use either the
mouse or the cursor keys to select text. In fact, you cannot do anything but
select text in extended selection mode (unless you press the Esc key to exit
that mode).
Don’t let the F8 key weirdness boggle you. Instead, consider these steps the
next time you need to mark a block of text:
1. Position the insertion pointer at the start of the block of text.
2. Press the F8 key.
The F8 key drops anchor and marks one end of the block.
3. Use the keyboard’s cursor keys to select the block of text.
The cursor-navigation keys are discussed in Chapter 4.
You can also press a letter key to select text up to and including that
letter. If you press N, you select all text up to and including the next N
in your document. Nice. Nifty. Neat-o.
Word highlights text from the point where you dropped anchor with F8
to wherever you move the insertion pointer.
4. Do something with the selected block of text.
Word remains in extended selection mode until you actually do some-
thing with the block.
Doing something with a block of text is covered in the second half of this
chapter.
To cancel the extended selection, press the Esc key. That ends extended
selection mode, but still keeps the block of text marked.
 You can use the mouse and the F8 key to get really fancy. Position the
cursor at either end of the block you want to mark, and press the F8 key.
Then position the mouse cursor at the other end of the block and press
the left mouse button. Everything from there to there is marked.
84
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

 After pressing the F8 key, you can use the Find command to locate a spe-
cific bit of text. Word marks all text between the spot where F8 was
pressed (the anchor) and the text that the Find command locates.
 Pressing the F8 key twice selects the current word (the one the insertion
pointer is blinking inside of).
 Pressing the F8 key thrice (three times) selects the current sentence.
 Pressing the F8 key four times selects the current paragraph as a block
of text.
 Pressing the F8 key five times selects the entire document, from top to
bottom.
 No matter how many times you press F8, be aware that it always drops
anchor. So, pressing F8 once or five times means that you’re still in
extended selection mode. Do something with the block or press Esc to
cancel that mode.
Blocking the whole dang-doodle document
The biggest block you can mark is the entire document. Word has a specific
command to do that, to select all the text in a document: From the Home tab,
locate the Editing area. (Click the Editing button when the entire Editing area
isn’t visible.) Then choose Select➪Select All. Instantly, the entire document is
marked as a single block-o-text.
From the keyboard, you can use Ctrl+A to select all of a document, or just press
the F8 key five times. Or, you can even use the obscure Ctrl+5 (the 5 on the
numeric keypad) key combo.
85
Chapter 7: Text Blocks, Stumbling Blocks, Writer’s Blocks
Would you rather select text by letter or by word?
When you’re selecting more than a single word,
the mouse tends to grab text a full word at a time.
If you want Word to select text by characters
rather than by words (which is what I prefer),
follow these steps:
1. Choose Word Options from the Office
Button menu.
2. Choose Advanced from the list on the left
side of the Applications Settings window.
3. In the Editing Options section (on the right),
remove the check mark by the item labeled
When Selecting Automatically Select
Entire Word.
4. Click OK.

Deselecting a Block
Word treats all text marked in a block the same, by applying the same format-
ting commands to that text, moving the text, searching within the block, and
so on. But when you mark a block of text and change your mind, you must
unmark, or deselect, the text. Here are a few handy ways to do that:
 Move the insertion pointer. It doesn’t matter how you move the insertion
pointer, with the keyboard or with the mouse — doing so unhighlights
the block. Note that this trick does not exit the F8 key’s extended selec-
tion mode.
 Press the Esc key and then the ←key. This method works to end
extended selection mode.
 Shift+F5. The Shift+F5 key is the Go Back command (see Chapter 4),
but it also deselects a block of text and returns you to the text you
were editing before making the selection.
You’ve Marked the Block — Now What?
You can block punches, block hats, block and tackle, play with building
blocks and engine blocks, take nerve blocks, suffer from mental blocks, jog
for blocks and, naturally, block text. But what can be done with those marked
blocks of text?
The primary thing you can do with blocks of text is to copy or move them.
Like using search and replace, rearranging your text with blocks is one of the
true blessings of a word processor. Call it a typewriter-killing feature.
The subject of copying, moving, and duplicating blocks of text is covered in
this section. If you’re used to copying, cutting, and pasting in Windows, doing
the same with blocks in Word will be easy for you. Beyond that, you can do
the following things with a block of text in Word:
 Delete the block with the Delete or Backspace keys. (See Chapter 5 for
more information on deleting text.)
 Use the Search command, or Search and Replace, exclusively within the
block of text. See Chapter 6.
 Proof the block, by reviewing your spelling and grammar goofs, as cov-
ered in Chapter 8.
 Print the block. (See Chapter 10.)
 Format the block. The various formatting commands are covered in 
Part III of this book.
86
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

The command you use affects only the text within that block.
Copying a block
After a block is marked, you can copy it into another part of your document,
to duplicate the text. The original block remains untouched by this opera-
tion. Follow these steps to copy a block of text from one place to another:
1. Mark the block.
Detailed instructions about doing this task are offered in the first part of
this chapter.
2. From the Home tab, choose the Copy tool from the Clipboard area.
There’s no visual clue that the text has been copied; it remains selected.
3. Move the insertion pointer to the position where you want to copy
the block.
Don’t worry if there’s no room there! Word inserts the block into your
text.
4. Choose the Paste tool from the Clipboard area.
The block appears. (See the later section “Options for pasting text” to
find out what to do about the wee li’l clipboard icon that appears by the
pasted text.)
The block of text you copy is inserted into your text just as though you had
typed it there by yourself.
 The shortcut key for copying in Word (and Windows) is Ctrl+C.
 The shortcut key for pasting is Ctrl+V.
 After you copy a block, you can paste it into your document a second
time. That’s because whenever a block of text is cut or copied, Word
remembers it. You can yank that block into your document again at
any time — sort of like pasting text again after it has already been
pasted in. You use Ctrl+V, the Paste shortcut. Pasting text again simply
pastes down a second copy of the block, spit-spot (as Mary Poppins
would say).
 You can paste the block into another document you’re working on, or
even into another application. (This is a Windows trick, which most
good books on Windows discuss.)
 Refer to the section “The Miracle of Collect-and-Paste,” near the end of
this chapter, for more copy and paste choices.
87
Chapter 7: Text Blocks, Stumbling Blocks, Writer’s Blocks

Moving a block
To move a block of text, you select the text and then cut and paste. This is
almost exactly the same as copying a block, described in the previous sec-
tion, although in Step 2 you choose the Cut tool rather than the Copy tool.
Otherwise, all the steps are the same.
Don’t be alarmed when the block of text vanishes! That’s cutting in action;
the block of text is being moved, not copied. You see the block of text again
when you paste.
 The keyboard shortcut for the Cut command is Ctrl+X.
 Don’t panic! If you screw up, remember that the Ctrl+Z Undo shortcut
undoes a block move.
Options for pasting text
When you paste text in Word, the Paste Options icon appears near the end
of the pasted block of text, as shown in the margin. Let it not annoy you!
That button allows you to select formatting for the pasted block because
occasionally the block may contain formatting that, well, looks very ugly
after it’s pasted in.
Using the Paste Options icon is utterly optional. In fact, you can continue
typing or working in Word, and the icon bows out, fading away like some neb-
bish who boldly asked a power blonde to go out with him and she utterly
failed to recognize his existence. Like that. Meanwhile, to use the Paste
Options icon to adjust pasted text formatting in Word, comply with these
steps:
1. Point the mouse at the Paste Options icon.
The icon turns into a “button,” with a downward-pointing triangle on one
end. If you’ve been using Windows for any length of time, you’ll recog-
nize this as a drop-down menu gizmo.
2. Click the downward-pointing triangle.
A menu appears, from which you can select various formatting options
(see Figure 7-2).
88
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Here’s a quick summary of the options available:
 Keep Source Formatting: The formatting is fine; don’t do a thing.
 Match Destination Formatting: Reformat the pasted block so that it
looks like the text it’s being pasted into.
 Keep Text Only: Just paste in the text — no formatting.
 Set Default Paste: Opens the Word Options dialog box where you can, in
the Cut, Copy and Paste section, permanently set various pasting
options in Word.
Choose an option to match the formatting you want.
Special pasting
Pasting is simple, although trying to figure how the V in Ctrl+V means “paste”
can boggle the mind. Regardless, when you know the format of the thing
you’re pasting or you need to use a specific format, you can employ the Paste
Special command: Click the bottom of the Paste button to display a menu,
shown in Figure 7-3, and choose Paste Special from the list. The Paste Special
dialog box appears.
Figure 7-3:
Using the
Paste
Special
command.
Figure 7-2:
Various

options.
89
Chapter 7: Text Blocks, Stumbling Blocks, Writer’s Blocks

The Paste Special dialog box lists options for pasting text, graphics, or what-
ever was last copied or cut; the number of options depends on what’s waiting
to be pasted. For example, you can copy a chunk of an Excel spreadsheet and
paste it into your Word document as a spreadsheet, table, picture, text, or
what-have-you.
I often use Paste Special to paste in text from a Web page but without all the
HTML-blah-blah formatting. I choose the Unformatted Text option from the
Paste Special dialog box and click OK, and the text is pasted into Word as
plain text and not as some Web object doodad.
Copying or moving a block with the mouse
When you have to move a block only a short distance, you can use the
mouse to drag-move or drag-copy the block. This feature is handy, but usu-
ally works best if you’re moving or copying between two locations that you
can see right on the screen. Otherwise, you’re scrolling your document with
the mouse while you’re playing with blocks, which is like trying to grab an
angry snake.
To move any selected block of text with the mouse, just drag the block:
Point the mouse cursor anywhere in the blocked text, and then drag the
block to its new location. Notice how the mouse pointer changes, as shown
in the margin. That means you’re moving the text.
Copying a block with the mouse works just like moving the block, except that
you press the Ctrl key as you drag. When you do that, a plus sign appears in
the mouse pointer (see the margin). That’s your sign that the block is being
copied and not just moved.
 The Paste Options icon appears after you’ve “dropped” the chunk of
text. Refer to the preceding section for more information on the Paste
Options icon.
 When you drag a block of text with the mouse, you’re not copying it to
the Clipboard. You cannot use the Paste (Ctrl+V) command to paste
in the block again.
 A linked copy is created by dragging a selected block of text with the
mouse and holding down both the Shift and Ctrl keys. When you release
the mouse button, the copied block plops down into your document
with a dark highlight. That’s your clue that the copy is linked to the 
original; changes in the original are reflected in the copy and vice versa.
90
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Copying and moving with the F2 key
Another way to move or copy a block is to press the F2 key after the block is
selected. As long as you can remember the F2 key, moving or copying a block
by using this technique can be very handy, as explained here:
1. Select a block of text.
2. Press the F2 key.
Notice how the status bar says “Move to where?”
3. Move the insertion pointer to where you want to paste.
Use the cursor keys or scroll with the mouse. Wherever you move the
insertion pointer is where the text is pasted.
4. Press Enter to paste the text.
And the block is moved.
To copy rather than move a block, press Shift+F2 in Step 2. The status bar
says “Copy to where?”
The Miracle of Collect-and-Paste
When you copy or paste a block of text, that block is placed into a storage
place called the Clipboard. The block of text remains on the Clipboard until
it’s replaced by something else — another block of text or a graphic or any-
thing cut or copied in Windows. (The Clipboard is a Windows thing, which is
how you can copy and paste between Windows applications.)
In Word, however, the Clipboard can hold more than one thing at time. This
allows you to copy, copy, copy, and then use a special Clipboard view pane
to selectively paste text back into your document. They call it “collect and
paste,” and I firmly believe that this is a handy and welcome feature — but
one that also takes a bit of explaining.
Looking at the Clipboard
Word lets you see the contents of the Clipboard, to view the last several
items that have been cut or copied and, optionally, paste those items back
into your document.
91
Chapter 7: Text Blocks, Stumbling Blocks, Writer’s Blocks

To view the Clipboard task pane (its official name), click the thing in the
lower-right corner of the Clipboard group on the Home tab, right next to the
word Clipboard. The Clipboard task pane then appears in the writing part
of Word’s window, perhaps looking similar to what’s shown in Figure 7-4.
The scrolling list contains the last several items you’ve copied, not only from
Word but from other programs as well.
Pasting items from the Clipboard task pane is covered in the next section.
 You can use the Copy command multiple times in a row to collect text
when the Clipboard task pane is visible.
 The Clipboard can hold only 24 items. If any more than that is copied or
cut, the older items in the list are “pushed off” to make room for the new
ones. The current number of items is shown at the top of the task pane.
 Other programs in Microsoft Office (Excel and PowerPoint, for example)
also share this collect-and-paste feature.
 You can close the task pane when you’re done with collect and paste:
Click the X in the upper-right corner of the task pane window.
Pasting from the Clipboard task pane
To paste any collected text from the Clipboard view pane into your docu-
ment, simply click the mouse on that chunk of text. The text is copied from
the Clipboard and inserted into your document at the insertion pointer’s
location, just as though you typed it yourself.
Figure 7-4:

Clipboard
task pane.

Part II: Word Processing Basics 

After pasting, the Paste Options icon appears next to the pasted text. Refer to
the section “Options for pasting text,” earlier in this chapter, to find out what
do to with that thing.
 You can click the Paste All button to paste each and every item from the
Clipboard into your document.
 Click only once! When you double-click, you insert two copies of
the text.
Cleansing the Clipboard task pane
You’re free to clean up Word’s Clipboard whenever the Clipboard task pane is
visible. To remove a single item, point the mouse at that item and click the
downward-pointing triangle to the right of the item. Choose Delete from the
shortcut menu, and that one item is zapped from the Clipboard.
To whack all the items on the Clipboard, click the Clear All button at the top
of the Clipboard task pane. I do this if I plan on collecting several items to be
pasted at once elsewhere. For example, I click Clear All and then go out and
copy, copy, copy. Then I move the insertion pointer to where I want every-
thing pasted and click the Paste All button — and I’m done.
Note that you cannot undo any clearing or deleting that’s done in the
Clipboard task pane. Be careful!

— Mark Twain
I
turn to no greater source on the subject of spelling and grammar than
my favorite American author, Mark Twain. His thoughts on the topic are
abundant.
Twain once described spelling in the English language as “drunken.”
Specifically, Twain blamed the alphabet. Me? I peg the problem on vowels,
but I mostly blame all the foreign words in English. Come to think of it, about
60 percent of English is composed of foreign words. Just pluck them out and
the language would be perfect! But I digress.

This chapter covers Word’s amazing proofing tools. These include the spell
checker, the grammar-checking thing, plus other amazing tools and features
to help you get just the right word, use it, and spell it correctly.
Hun Dewing Yore Mist Aches
As the title of this section suggests, it may very well be true that Word’s 
document proofing tools know an impressive number of words and have 
mastered countless grammatical rules, and they may do their darndest to
recognize context, but they still often fail. So, just because it appears that
your document contains no errors doesn’t mean that everything is perfect.
There’s no better way to proof a document than to read it with human eyes.
(My editor enthusiastically agrees!)
Check Your Spelling
Word’s built-in spell checker works the second you start typing. Like a
hungry leopard, the spell checker is ready to pounce on its unsuspecting
prey, the misspelled word or typo!
Spelling is corrected in two ways in Word. The most obvious way is that an
unrecognized word is underlined with a red zigzag. More subtly, the offending
word is corrected for you automatically. That feature, AutoCorrect, is covered
later in this chapter.
The red zigzag of shame
Word has an internal library consisting of tens of thousands of words, all
spelled correctly. When you type a word that doesn’t exist in the library
(yeah, looking up words is one thing the computer can do quickly), the word
that’s typed is marked as suspect. It appears underlined with a red zigzag, as
shown in Figure 8-1. What to do, what to do?
My advice: Keep typing. Don’t let the “red zigzag of a failed elementary educa-
tion” perturb you. It’s more important to get your thoughts up on the screen
than to stop and fuss over inevitable typos.
96
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

When you’re ready, say, during one of those inevitable pauses that takes
place as you write, go back and fix your spelling errors. Here’s what to do:
1. Locate the misspelled word.
Look for the red zigzag underline.
2. Right-click the misspelled word.
Up pops a shortcut menu and the Mini Toolbar, similar to what’s shown
in Figure 8-2.
3. Choose from the list the word you intended to type.
In Figure 8-2, the word tongue fits the bill. Click that word and it’s auto-
matically inserted into your document, to replace the spurious word.
Figure 8-2:
Choose the
properly
spelled
word from
the list.
Figure 8-1:
The word
tounge is
flagged as
misspelled.
97
Chapter 8: Proofing Your Document (Spelling and Grammar)

If the word you intended to type isn’t on the list, don’t fret. Word isn’t that
smart. You may have to use a real dictionary or take another stab at spelling
the word phonetically and then correct it again.
 The Mini Toolbar, shown at the top of the menu in Figure 8-2, is used for
quick formatting. It’s the same Mini Toolbar that appears when you
select text (see Chapter 7); it also appears whenever you right-click text,
as is done with a spell-check correction.
 Word turns off automatic proofing when your document grows over a
specific size. For example, on my computer, when the document is more
than 100 pages long, automatic spell checking is disabled. A warning
appears to alert you when this happens. Note that you can still manually
spell-check, which is covered in the section “Proofing Your Entire
Document at Once,” later in this chapter.
What to do when the spell checker 
stupidly assumes that a word is 
misspelled but in fact it isn’t
Occasionally, Word’s spell checker bumps into a word it doesn’t recognize,
such as your last name or perhaps your city. Word dutifully casts doubt on
the word, by underlining it with the notorious red zigzag. Yes, this is one of
those cases where the computer is wrong.
When a word is flagged as incorrectly spelled or as a typo, you can use two
commands, both of which are found on the pop-up menu when you right-click
the word (refer to Figure 8-2). The commands are Ignore All and Add to
Dictionary.
Ignore All: Select this command when the word is properly spelled and you
don’t want Word to keep flagging it as misspelled.
For example, in your science fiction short story, there’s a character named
Zadlux. Word believes it to be a spelling error, but you (and all the people of
the soon-to-be-conquered planet Drebulon) know better. After you choose the
Ignore All command, all instances of the suspect word are cheerfully ignored,
but only in that one document.
Add to Dictionary: This command adds words to the list that Word refers to
so that the word becomes part of the internal Spelled Correctly library.
98
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

For example, I once lived on Pilchuck Avenue, which Word thinks is a mis-
spelling of the word Paycheck. If only. So, when I right-click the incorrectly
flagged word, I choose the Add to Dictionary command. Presto — the word
Pilchuck is added to Word’s internal dictionary. I’ll never have to spell-check
that work again.
 If the word looks correct but is red-wiggly-underlined anyway, it could be
a repeated word. Those are flagged as misspelled by Word, so you can
either choose to delete the repeated word or just ignore it.
 Word ignores certain types of words. For example, words with numbers
in them or words written in all capitals, which are usually abbreviations.
For example, Pic6 is ignored because it has a 6 in it. The word NYEP is
ignored because it’s in all caps.
 You can adjust how spell-checking works, especially if you feel that it’s
being too picky. See the section “Customizing Proofing Options,” later in
this chapter.
Undoing an Ignore All command
Choosing the Ignore All command means that all instances of a given mis-
spelled word or typo are ignored in your document. This holds true even
when you save that document and open it again later. So, if you make a mis-
take and would rather have the ignored word regarded once more, do this:
1. Click the Word Options button on the Office Button menu.
The Word Options window appears.
2. Choose Proofing on the left side of the window.
3. Scroll down the right side of the window (if necessary) until you can
see the Recheck Document button; click that button.
A warning dialog box appears, reminding you of what you’re about
to do.
4. Click the Yes button.
Everything you’ve told Word to ignore while proofing your document is
now ignored. It’s the ignore-ignore command!
5. Click the OK button to return to your document.
99
Chapter 8: Proofing Your Document (Spelling and Grammar)

Note that following these steps causes all ignored words, as well as grammati-
cal errors you’ve chosen to ignore, to become visible once again. There’s no
way to undo this command.
These steps affect only the current document. The Ignore All command
affects only the current document.
Un-adding words to the dictionary
When you choose the Add to Dictionary command, the given word is placed
into something called the Custom dictionary. Recognizing that people may
change their minds, Word allows you to edit the Custom dictionary, to
remove words you may have added accidentally.
To remove unwanted words from the Custom dictionary, follow these steps:
1. Click the Word Options button in the Office Button menu.
The Word Options window shows up.
2. From the left side of the window, choose Proofing.
3. Click the button labeled Custom Dictionaries.
The Custom Dictionaries dialog box appears.
4. Select the CUSTOM.DIC dictionary file.
It’s probably the only item in the list.

Instant Text-Fixin’ with AutoCorrect
Some of your typos and spelling errors will never be graced with the red
zigzag. That’s because Word quickly fixes hundreds of common typos and
spelling errors on the fly. It’s done by the AutoCorrect feature, and you really
have to be quick to see it.
AutoCorrect in action
There’s nothing to using AutoCorrect; it happens automatically. In Word, try
to type the word mispell. You cannot! Word uses AutoCorrect, and suddenly
you see misspell.
Most of the commonly misspelled words can be found in AutoCorrect’s reper-
toire: beleive, suposed, recieve, and so on. Try a few. See whether you can
baffle Word!
In addition to fixing spelling errors, AutoCorrect helps you enter special 
characters. For example, type (C) and AutoCorrect properly inserts the (c)
Copyright symbol. Ditto for (TM) for Trademark. Typing --> is translated into
an arrow, and even :) becomes a happy face.
Beyond spelling, AutoCorrect fixes some common punctuation. It automati-
cally capitalizes the first letter of a sentence. AutoCorrect capitalizes I when
you forget to, it properly capitalizes the names of days, fixes the iNVERSE
cAPS lOCK pROBLEM, plus fixes other common typos.
101
Chapter 8: Proofing Your Document (Spelling and Grammar)

Do your own AutoCorrect entries
One of the joys of AutoCorrect is that you can add your own commonly mis-
spelled words to its list. For example, I’m always goofing up the word brief.
I before E? E before I? Never mind! I need to fix the spelling error only once
by placing my typo and the proper spelling into AutoCorrect’s repertoire.
This is cinchy:
1. Right-click the misspelled word.
Normally, you choose the proper spelling from the list. But that fixes the
word only once. Instead:
2. Click the AutoCorrect item.
Up pops a submenu containing various corrections, as shown in Figure 8-3.
3. Choose the properly spelled word from the AutoCorrect submenu.
The word is added to the AutoCorrect list, and, as a special favor, Word
corrects the word in your text as well.
Whenever your typo is encountered, Word automatically corrects it for you.
But you must remember to use the AutoCorrect item from the spell-check-
thingy pop-up menu on your first sighting of the misspelled word rather than
just choose the corrected word from the list.
Figure 8-3:
Auto
Correcting a
werd.
102
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

If possible, try to add only lowercase words with AutoCorrect. When you 
add a word with an initial capital letter, such as Werd, AutoCorrect
replaces only words with an initial capital letter. When you use AutoCorrect
on a word that’s all lowercase, it’s fixed every time.
Undoing an AutoCorrect correction
You can reverse AutoCorrect instant changes, but only when you’re quick.
The secret is to press Backspace or Ctrl+Z (the Undo command) immediately
after AutoCorrect makes its correction. When you do that, you see a blue 
rectangle under the first letter of the still-corrected word, as shown in the
margin.
Point the mouse at the rectangle to see the AutoCorrect Options icon.
Clicking the downward-pointing arrow on the icon displays some choices,
as shown in Figure 8-4 and explained here:
 Change Back to “whatever”: Choose this option to undo the
AutoCorrection.
 Stop Automatically Correcting “whatever”: Choose this option to
remove the word from the AutoCorrect library so that it’s not corrected
automatically again. (But it may still be flagged as incorrect by the spell
checker.)
 Control AutoCorrect Options: This item displays the AutoCorrect dialog
box, which is used to customize various AutoCorrect settings and edit
or create new entries in the AutoCorrect library. Refer to the section
“Customizing Proofing Options,” later in this chapter.
You don’t have to go with the AutoCorrection. If you don’t like the change,
press Ctrl+Z to undo or use Backspace to fix the AutoCorrect option. Clicking
the blue rectangle is optional.

Grammar Be Good
If spelling is drunken, grammar is a hallucination. Oh, I could rant on this for
hours. Suffice it to say, no matter what the grammarians think, English is not
Latin. It can’t be. Latin usually has one, very proper way to say something.
English has many ways and many words with which to express the same
thought. That’s why English is so poetic. That’s why so-called English gram-
mar has so many exceptions that it’s silly to make any rules.
Regardless of what I think, Word does come with a grammar checker, and it
does, at times, underline suspicious words or phrases with an angry green
zigzag. It’s your clue that you’ve somehow offended Word’s sense of gram-
matical justice.
As with a spelling error, right-click the green-underlined text. The pop-up
menu that appears either explains why the sentence is wrong or offers an
alternative sentence that you can choose. There’s also an option to ignore
the error, which I find myself using quite a bit.
 When you select About This Sentence from the pop-up menu, the Office
Help system attempts to explain which part of the English Language
Book of Rules you offended.
 Sometimes you may be puzzled about what the grammar checker finds
wrong. Don’t give up! Always check your entire sentence for a potential
error. For example, the grammar checker may suggest had in place of
have. Chances are, have is correct but some other word in the sentence
has an unwanted s attached.
 It’s possible to customize or even turn off grammar checking. Refer to
the section “Customizing Proofing Options,” later in this document.
Proofing Your Entire Document at Once
Before the days of on-the-fly spell checking, you proofed your document by
entering a special spell-check mode. In spell-check mode, the computer
would read your document, from top to bottom, and alert you to any goofy
words it found. You can still use this type of proofing, which some folks find
easier to handle and less disruptive than automatic spell checking. Here’s
how it’s done:
104
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

1. Click the Review tab.
2. In the Proofing group, click the Spelling & Grammar button.
The Spelling and Grammar dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-5. It
displays a chunk of your document at a time, with each chunk contain-
ing a spelling or grammar error.
Here’s what you can do:
• To fix the error, edit the text in the box.
• Use the Ignore button(s) to skip the error, or click the Next
Sentence button to keep moving through the document.
• Choose a proper spelling from the list and then click the Change
button.
3. Continue checking your document until Word says that you’re done.
You may find it even easier to do an all-at-once proof if you turn off automatic
spell- and grammar-checking. See the following section to find out how this
can be done.
 Don’t forget that Undo button! Often times, you can enter a trance while
you’re document proofing. Undo helps you go back and change some-
thing you may not have paid attention to.
 One of the easiest ways to breeze through a document and check your
spelling is to click the Spell icon on the status bar. As you click, you’re
taken to the next spelling (or grammatical) error, with a handy pop-up
window showing up to help you fix your boo-boos.
Figure 8-5:

Chapter 8: Proofing Your Document (Spelling and Grammar)

Customizing Proofing Options
All document proofing options and settings are kept in one place, in the
Application Settings window. Here’s how to get there:
1. Click the Word Options button on the Office Button menu.
The Word Options dialog box appears.
2. Choose Proofing on the left side of the window.
The right side of the window contains options and settings for document
proofing.
Various options are turned on or off by adding or removing check marks; for
example:
 To direct Word not to spell-check a Web page address, put a check mark
by the item labeled Ignore Internet and File Addresses.
 To turn off on-the-fly spell checking, remove the check mark by the item
Check Spelling As You Type.
 To disable the grammar checking, remove the check mark by the item
Check Grammar As You Type.
 Click the Settings button by the Writing Style drop-down list to customize
and hone the grammatical transgressions that Word marks. (I typically
disable the Fragments warning because Word is often wrong when flag-
ging fragments.)
Here are some other proofing things you can do:
 You can click the AutoCorrect Options button to display the AutoCorrect
dialog box. Use that dialog box to modify AutoCorrect’s settings, add
new entries, delete bad AutoCorrect decisions, or edit existing entries.
Click OK to dismiss the Application Settings window.
Improving Your Word Power
Spelling and grammar are important, but beyond the basics, you want to
ensure that you use the best word. For example, is it right, or is it correct?
Is something hard, or is something difficult? It all depends on the context, of
course, as well as on your knowledge of the English language, your writing
experience, and your ability to cheat by using some handy tools: the
Thesaurus, the Translator, and the Research features in Word.
106
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

A thesaurus is not a colossal 
prehistoric beast
When two words share the same meaning, they’re said to be synonyms; for
example, big and large. Synonyms are helpful in that they allow you to find
better, more descriptive words and especially to avoid using the same tired
old words over and over. Obviously, knowing synonyms is a handy thing for
any writer. When you don’t know a lot of them, you can use a handy, nay,
practical tool called a thesaurus to help you.
To find the synonym of any word, right-click that word in your document.
From the pop-up menu, choose the Synonyms submenu to see a list of words
with a similar meaning (see Figure 8-6).
The Synonyms submenu displays a list of a dozen or so synonyms for big,
plus one antonym (a word with the opposite meaning), as shown in Figure
8-6. To replace the word in the document with a synonym, just choose it from
the submenu.
Not all words have synonyms. If so, the Synonyms submenu displays (No
Suggestions). Oh, well.
Figure 8-6:
Synonyms
for big.
107
Chapter 8: Proofing Your Document (Spelling and Grammar)

At one time, there were synonyms for all words in the Word thesaurus.
Around half a dozen years ago, though, the censorship police took over and
hundreds of politically incorrect words were secreted away from Word’s
Thesaurus list. For example, try looking up the synonyms for idiot. Some 
synonyms list only one aspect of the word, such as the synonyms for dummy
deal with only mannequins and not “dumb” things. And why are there syn-
onyms for every color except black? Silly Microsoft.
The Research task pane
A better way to play with words, as opposed to just right-clicking and looking
up a synonym, is to use the Research view pane in Word. Summon it with
these commands:
1. Click the Review tab.
2. In the Proofing group, click the Research button.
The Research task pane appears in the document part of the window, as
shown in Figure 8-7. The selected word appears at the top.
3. Click the green Start Searching button — the one with the rightward-
pointing arrow.
Word uses vast resources to look up oodles of factual tidbits about the
word in question. The results are displayed in the list, as shown in
Figure 8-7, where Microsoft’s online Encarta dictionary has some 
definitions for the word blue.
4. Narrow the search by selecting Thesaurus English (U.S.) from the
drop-down list.
The list of synonyms shown in the Research task pane is far more thor-
ough than what you see when you right-click a word and choose the
Synonym sub-menu.
5. To choose a replacement word, point the mouse at the word and
choose the Insert command from the menu that appears.
Or, if the word intrigues you, choose Look Up from the drop-down menu
to see more variations.
6. Close the Research task pane by clicking the X in its upper-right
corner.
Or, you can click the Research button again on the Ribbon.
108
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Be sure to check out other options in the drop-down list, such as foreign trans-
lations as well as other various and rich sources for finding that right word.
Sadly, this feature is made less handy because it really requires full-time,
broadband Internet access to work best. Also, don’t be too disappointed with
the translation features: My copy of Word came with only French and Spanish
translations. Funny, but I can’t seem to find the often-ridiculed but necessary
Klingon translator.
Making Every Word Count
You pay the butcher by the pound. The dairyman is paid by the gallon.
Salesmen are paid by a percentage of the sale. Writers? They’re paid by
the word.
If you’re lucky enough to be paid for your writing, you know the “word count”
quite well. Magazine editors demand articles based on word length. “I need
350 hilarious words on Grandma sending her first e-mail,” an editor once told
me. And, novel writers typically boast of how many words are in their latest
efforts. “My next book is 350,000 words,” they say in a stuffy, nasal voice.
How do they know how many words there are?
Figure 8-7:

109
Chapter 8: Proofing Your Document (Spelling and Grammar)

The best way to see how many words dwell in your document is to view the
status bar. The word count appears after the label Words, and it’s updated as
you type.
When the status bar word count isn’t enough for you or it isn’t visible, you
can click the Review tab and then, from the Proofing group, click the Word
Count button. A detailed Word Count dialog box, similar to the one shown in
Figure 8-8, appears.
Click the Close button to banish the Word Count dialog box.

D
ocuments created by a word processor are just like documents you
create with a typewriter or by scribbling on a piece of paper, although
with a word processor your text is better formatted and bolstered by all
the fancy things you can do with a computer. Still, the greatest difference
between a computer document and a real document is that a computer docu-
ment is stored inside the computer; it doesn’t exist in the real world until it’s
printed on paper.
This chapter covers how Word deals with documents and how those docu-
ments are stored in the computer. Knowing how documents are stored is
very important! You want to make Save the command you use most often.
Knowing how to save and when to save and how the Open command works
are your keys to becoming a happy, productive word processing human.
All About Files
To understand documents, you must first recognize the importance of files.
This concept is vital to grasp if you ever want your computer experience to
be a pleasant one and not a nightmare.

Your computer stores all sorts of information. In addition to word processing
documents, the computer can store graphical images, music, and video as
well as programs, games, and all sorts of other stuff. Those items are all
kept inside the PC and are digitally encoded on the computer’s hard drive.
The digital information is organized, so unlike you and that drawer in your
kitchen filled with all sorts of random items (scissors, candles, plastic spoons,
and playing cards), the computer can easily find stuff when you need it.
Information on a computer’s hard drive exists as files. Each file contains infor-
mation, just as mason jars may contain fruits and jellies. The information the
file contains is electronic, so one file may be an image, another file may con-
tain music, another may be a video, and so on.
In Windows, a file appears as an icon. Each type of file has its own, unique
icon, which is used in Windows to help identify the file’s contents. The same
holds true with Word, which uses a specific icon to identify its documents, as
shown in the margin.
What’s important to remember is that after a Word document is saved to
disk, it exists as a file. Documents are their own thing, separate from Word,
the program that creates the documents.
Think of the relationship this way: A pianist uses sheet music to play a tune,
but the sheet music isn’t part of the piano. Just as you can store or mail sheet
music, you can store a Word document file (on a CD-R, for example) or send it
via e-mail. The Word document that exists on your computer’s hard drive as a
file is its own, unique thing.
For more information on understanding files as well as hard drives and
other basic computer concepts, I highly recommend reading my book PCs
For Dummies, published by Wiley. The more you know about your computer,
the happier you are as a computer user.
Making a New Document
Where did that document come from? I mean, you didn’t just pluck it from
thin air?
Well, actually, you probably did! The content of a document comes from your
brain, transmitted through your neck, shoulders, and arms, and then it
appears on the screen, thanks to your fingers fluttering over the computer
keyboard. That blank space you write upon? It did come from thin air — or,
rather, from thin electrons.
112
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

The computer equivalent of a blank sheet of paper comes into being in sev-
eral ways. That blank sheet of, well, electrons is the root of each document
you create in Word; all Word documents started out as described in this sec-
tion. Before pressing on, consider these general Word document tidbits:
 Documents in Word aren’t limited to any size other than the largest file size
allowed by your computer operating system. I believe that’s something
like 4,096MB under Windows, which may be wrong, but, still, that’s a ter-
ribly huge file. Put into perspective, all the works of William Shakespeare
can fit into a Word document that’s only 5MB.
 Size-wise, the typical word processing document is maybe 50K. Compare
that with 1,000K for the typical digital camera snapshot or 4,000K for
a typical MP3 (music) file, and you can see that word processing docu-
ments consume relatively little disk space.
 K? MB? GB? Bytes? Read my book PCs For Dummies (Wiley) for instant
computer headache relief.
 For speed’s sake, I recommend keeping your documents small. If you’re
writing a proposal, putting the whole thing in one document is fine.
If you’re writing a novel, make each chapter its own document. If you’re
writing the U.S. tax code, please stop!
 Writing long documents — say, over 100 pages — is fine, but when the
document size gets that large, Word begins to turn off features. For exam-
ple, automatic spell checking, image previews, and other “fun” features
may be suppressed in longer documents.
Quick! A blank sheet of paper!
Faster than newspaper reporter Clark Kent can whip out a sheet of paper and
roll it into his typewriter, you, mild-mannered reader, can summon a new,
blank document in Word. It’s cinchy, and no amount of kryptonite can
thwart you:
1. Choose the New command from the Office Button menu.
The New Document window appears, listing every dang-doodle option
known to Word (at least on this planet) for creating a new document.
2. Ensure that Blank Document is preselected for you in the Blank and
Recent area.
3. Click the Create button.
Instantly, the blank document appears, ready for typing!

Chapter 9: Documents and Files

Crack your knuckles and get to work!
 A faster way to start a new document? Glad you asked: Press Ctrl+N on
the keyboard. That’s the shortcut key for New Document. Poof! Instantly,
you’re off and writing even faster than before.
 You don’t have to quit Word when you just want to start working on a
new document.
Using a template
New, blank documents are fine for creating something from scratch. When you
want to save time, though, you can create a new document based on a tem-
plate rather than start afresh every time.
A template is a special type of document that contains preset information and
formatting. For example, a template can define a set of styles for use in for-
matting the text. The template can include the company letterhead and logo.
I use a template whenever I write plays or movie scripts, send faxes, or send
invoices. A template can even contain boilerplate text — a complete document
where you merely fill in the blanks.
Using a template is as easy as starting a new document. No matter which
template you use, start by choosing the New command from the Office
Button menu. The New Document window appears and provides you with
access to templates in a variety of ways:
 To reuse any template you’ve recently used, click to select that template
from the Recently Used Templates part of the window. Click the Create
button to start a new document based on that template.
 To see all templates you’ve created, choose the My Templates item. This
action closes the New Document window and opens the New window,
which lists all your own templates. Click to select one, and then click the
OK button to start a new document based on that template.
 You can peruse the vast treasure trove of templates stored online
for Microsoft Office. To do so, choose a category from the list under
Microsoft Office Online in the New Document window. A list of templates
is then fetched from the Internet and displayed in the window. Choose a
template that pleases you, and then click the Download button to start a
new document based on that template.
114
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

As you use Word, you’ll doubtless create your own set of templates, especially
when you find yourself re-creating the same type of document over and over.
Creating your own templates is easy; refer to Chapter 17.
Things to remember:
 Opening a document with a template doesn’t change the template; your
new document is merely using the template’s styles and any text it
already has.
 Refer to Chapter 17 for more information on templates.
 Refer to Part III of this book for general information on styles in a 
document.
 One option in the New Document dialog box is named New from Existing.
Using this option is like using the Open command, although the docu-
ment you open remains unchanged on disk. The document’s contents
are placed into a new document for you to edit.
 Some Word templates can also be used to create a Web page or e-mail
message. Honestly, Word makes a lousy Web page editor and an even
worse e-mail program. If you want to make Web pages, get a Web page
editor. For sending e-mail, use an e-mail program, not a word processor.
Saving a Document
The most important thing you can do to a document is save it. Create a per-
manent copy of what you see on-screen by saving that document as a file on
disk. That way, you can use the document again, keep a copy for business
reasons, copy the file to a CD-R, e-mail the document, or just keep the thing
for sentimental reasons. And all that requires saving!
Saving a new document 
to disk the first time
Don’t think that you have to wait until you finish a document to save it to
disk. In fact, saving should be done almost immediately — as soon as you
have a few sentences or paragraphs. Save! Save! Save!
115
Chapter 9: Documents and Files

To save a document that hasn’t already been saved to disk, follow these
steps:
1. Choose the Save As command from the Office Button menu.
Just click the Save As item on the menu — not the right-pointing arrow,
which lists some interesting but confusing options. Choosing the Save
As button displays the Save As dialog box.
The Save As dialog box appears differently, depending on whether you’re
using Windows Vista or Windows XP. The Windows XP version is shown
in Figure 9-1.
2. Type a name for your document in the File Name box.
Word automatically selects the first line or first several words of your
document as a filename and puts it in the Save dialog box. If that’s okay,
you can move on to Step 3. Otherwise, type a name in the File name box.
Refer to the later sidebar “Complicated — but important — information
about filenames” for file-naming rules.
3. Optionally, choose a location for your file.
Word selects the Documents or My Documents folder as the location for
any document you save. This is fine for a while, but eventually you’ll
want to organize your documents by saving them in their own, unique
folders.
Figure 9-1:
The Save As
dialog box.
116
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

You can use the various gizmos in the Save As dialog box to choose
another folder for your document. This is really a Windows thing; the
Save As dialog box is different between Windows Vista and Windows XP.
4. Click the Save button.
The file is now safely stored on disk.
At this point, you can keep working. As you work, continue to save; refer to
the section “Saving or updating a document,” later in this chapter.
 There’s no need to quit after you save a document. Indeed, the idea is to
save as you go.
 The only time you need to use the Save As dialog box is when you first
create a document. After that, you can use the Save command merely to
update your document, by storing the latest modifications to disk as you
write.
 Your clue that the file has been successfully saved is that the filename
now appears on the document’s title bar, near the top of the screen.
 Always save your document, even after you’ve typed only a few lines
of text.
 The Save As command can also be used to save a document with a new
name or to a different location on disk. Refer to Chapter 25 for details.
Problems with saving a document to disk
Saving a document involves working with both Word and Windows. This
process doubles the chances for something going wrong, so it’s ripe time for
an error message. A potential message you may see is
The file whatever already exists
You have three choices:
 Replace Existing File: Nope.
 Save Change with a Different Name: Yep.
 Merge Changes into Existing File: Nope.
After choosing the middle option, type a different file name in the Save As
dialog box.
117
Chapter 9: Documents and Files

Another common problem is when a message that’s displayed reads some-
thing like this:
The file name, location, or format ‘whatever’ is not
valid...
That’s Word’s less-than-cheerful way of telling you that the filename contains a
boo-boo character. To be safe, stick to letters, numbers, and spaces when you’re
naming a file. Check the nearby sidebar, “Complicated — but important —
information about filenames.” Then click OK and try again.
Saving or updating a document
Every so often as you continue to work on your document, you should save
again. That way, any changes you’ve made since the last time you saved are
remembered and recorded on disk permanently. I generally save my docu-
ments dozens of times a day, usually when the phone rings or when I get up
for a fresh cup of coffee or to use the potty or, often, when I’m just bored.
To resave a document that has already been saved to disk, choose the Save
command from the Office Button menu. There’s no feedback, and the Save As
dialog box doesn’t show up. That’s because you’ve already given the file a
name; the Save command merely updates the existing file on disk.
118
Part II: Word Processing Basics 
Complicated — but important — 
information about filenames
Filenames are a heck of a lot more flexible than
they were in the primitive days of computing.
Even so, you still have to follow rules about what
you can and cannot name a file. Here’s the list:
 A filename can be longer than 200 ridicu-
lous-something characters; even so, keep
your filenames short and descriptive.
 A filename can include letters, numbers, and
spaces and can start with a letter or number.
 A filename can contain periods, commas,
hyphens, and even underlines.
 A filename cannot contain any of these
characters: \ / : * ? “ < > |
Word automatically appends a three- or four-
character filename extension to all your docu-
ments — like a last name. You may or may not
see this extension, depending on how you’ve
configured Windows. No matter, you don’t need
to manually type the extension yourself; just
worry about giving the document a proper and
descriptive filename.

 The fastest way to save a document is by using the Ctrl+S keyboard
shortcut.
 You can also click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar to save a
document to disk.
 The most bizarre command for saving a document: Shift+F12.
Saving when you’re done
Time to call it quits. The last save you do when you’re done with a document
happens as you either close the document or quit Word. Either way, when the
document hasn’t been saved, or was changed since the last save, you’re
asked to save again, as shown in Figure 9-2.
Here are your options:
Yes: The document is saved. If you’ve been really bad and haven’t saved the
document at all, the Save As dialog box appears when you choose Yes. See
the earlier section “Saving a new document to disk the first time.”
No: Don’t save the document. Any changes made since the document was
last saved are lost, or if the document was never saved, the entire thing is
lost forever.
Cancel: Word returns you to your document for more editing and stuff.
Choose, but choose wisely. I recommend the Yes option.
 To close a document without quitting Word, choose the Close command
from the Office Button menu. The keyboard shortcut for the Close com-
mand is Ctrl+W.
 There’s no reason to quit Word and start it again to begin working with a
blank slate. Just use the New Document command again: Ctrl+N.
 Always quit Word properly. Never turn off your PC or reset it when Word
or Windows is still on-screen.
Figure 9-2:
Your last
chance
to save.
119
Chapter 9: Documents and Files

Not saving a document
Yes, it’s possible not to save a document. I don’t see the reason why: Modern
computer hard drives are just brimming with room, and Word documents
don’t consume much disk space. It doesn’t hurt to always save! But, if you
want to not save, and remove any possibility of getting your stuff back, either
close the document or quit Word.
To close the document, choose the Close command from the Office Button
menu or press Ctrl+W.
To quit Word, choose the Exit command from the Office Button menu.
Either way, when you’re asked to save the document, choose No.
Opening a Document
Saving a document to disk means nothing unless you have a way of retrieving
it. You actually have several ways to open a document previously saved as a
file on disk. This section mulls the possibilities.
Using the traditional Open command
Open is the standard computer command used to fetch a document from
disk. You use Open to hunt down documents that were previously saved and
open them like you’re unwrapping a present. The document is then displayed
in Word’s window like it has always been there.
To grab a file from disk — to open it — follow these steps:
1. Choose the Open command from the Office Button menu.
The Open dialog box materializes. It looks different between Windows
Vista and Windows XP, although it basically works the same. The
Windows XP version of the Open dialog box is shown in Figure 9-3.
2. Choose the document’s name with the mouse.
The Open dialog box — vast and wild as it is — contains a list of docu-
ments previously saved to disk, as you can see in Figure 9-3. Your job is
to find the one you want to open.
Using the Open dialog box, you can examine various folders on your
PC’s hard drive, and on any computer network your PC is connected to,
to scour for files to open. The way you use the Open dialog box differs
120
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

between Windows Vista and Windows XP; refer to a Windows reference
for specific information.
3. Click the Open button.
Word opens the highlighted file, carefully lifting it from your disk drive
and slapping it down on the screen.
After the document is open, you can edit it, just look at it, print it, or do what-
ever you want.
 Opening a document doesn’t erase it from your disk drive. In fact, the
original copy of the file stays on the hard drive until you use the Save
command to save the document to disk again.
 When you open a document, there’s no need to use the Save As com-
mand to save it again. Simply use the Save command (shortcut: Ctrl+S).
 The shortcut key for the Open command is Ctrl+O.
 You can also open a document from Windows itself. Merely locate a
Word document icon, double-click, and Word starts loading that docu-
ment for editing.
 Open is a nifty name for the command, don’t you think? If not, consider
that the original version of Microsoft Word for the PC used the File➪
Transfer➪Load command to open a file on disk.
 Do not open a file on any removable disk. Although it’s possible, it can
lead to headaches later if you remove the disk before Word is done with
the file. Because of that, I recommend that you use Windows to copy the
document from the removable disk to the PC’s hard drive. Then open it
with Word.
Figure 9-3:
The Open
dialog box.
121
Chapter 9: Documents and Files

A handy way to open a recent file
Word remembers the last several files you’ve been working on. It keeps them
in a list on the Office Button menu, as shown in Figure 9-4. Chances are good
that you probably need to open one of them, so choosing one from the Office
Button menu is a handy way to open that document quickly.
Those green pushpins by the document’s name allow you to permanently
attach a document to the Office Button menu. Click a pushpin to “push it in.”
That makes the document stick around in the list. Clicking the pushpin again
allows the document to fade away after a time.
Opening one document inside another
Sticking one document into the thorax of another document is neither
strange, obtuse, nor unnecessary. And, it involves no surgery. For example,
you may have your biography, résumé, or curriculum vitae in a file on disk
and want to add that information to the end of a letter begging for a job. If so,
or in any other circumstances that I can’t think of right now, follow these
steps:
Figure 9-4:
Recently
opened files
on the Office
Button
menu.
122
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

1. Position the insertion pointer where you want the other document’s
text to appear.
The text is inserted at that spot.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. From the Text group, choose Object➪Text from File.
A dialog box similar to the Open dialog box appears (refer to Figure 9-3).
4. Choose the icon representing the document you want to insert.
You can also use the gadgets and gizmos in the dialog box to locate a file
in another folder or on another disk drive or even on someone else’s
computer on the network. Such power!
5. Click the Insert button.
The document you insert becomes part of the original document, just as
though you had typed (and formatted) the whole thing right there with your
stubby little fingers.
 The resulting combined document still has the same name as the first
document; the document you inserted remains unchanged on disk.
 You can retrieve any number of documents on disk into your document,
one at a time. There’s no limit.
 The preceding steps allow you to grab a chunk of text saved as a docu-
ment and stick the text into another document. This process is often
called boilerplating, where a commonly used piece of text is slapped into
several documents. This process is also the way sleazy romance novels
are written.
 Biography. Résumé. Curriculum vitae. The more important you think you
are, the more alien the language used to describe what you’ve done.

ord helps you create documents short and small, silly and brilliant.
Some documents remain in the digital domain and never hit paper.
For example, when I’m done writing this chapter, I’ll e-mail this document to
my editor. But most documents need to escape from their electronic realm
and must manifest themselves in the physical world. For this task, you must
employ your computer’s printer.
Printing is one of the final steps of your word processing labors, the nirvana
to which all documents aspire. Getting it down on paper is historically the
way ideas are shared. Indeed, lugging around the computer and showing folks
your first novel on the screen just doesn’t cut it. No, you need a printer, and
you need some paper if you desire to be a document maker.
Preparing the Printer
Printing involves using the computer printer, which really is its own little
computer. When you yearn to print a document, the immediate hassle
you’re presented with is how to use two computers at one time. Coaxing a

computer printer into behaving properly is an art form. Therefore, I recom-
mend following these steps to ensure that the printer is ready to actually
print something:
1. Make sure that your printer is plugged in and properly connected to
your computer.
Refer to my book PCs For Dummies (Wiley) for more information on 
connecting and using a printer as well as various printer tips and stuff
like that.
2. Make sure that your laser printer has enough toner or that your ink
printer’s cartridges are brimming with ink.
Laser printers should have a good toner cartridge installed. If the laser
printer’s “toner low” indicator is on, replace the toner at once.
Most ink printers let you know when they’re out of ink, or you notice
that the image appears streaked or faded or is missing information.
Replace the ink cartridge at once.
3. Check the printer for paper.
The paper can feed from the back or top or enter from a paper tray, or 
it can be manually fed one sheet at a time. However your printer eats
paper, make sure that you have it properly stocked before you print.
4. Your printer must be online or selected before you can print 
anything.
This is weird: Some printers can be on but not ready to print. The power
is on, but unless the printer is online or selected, it ignores the computer.
To force those types of printers to listen to the computer, you must
press the Online or Select (or similar) button.
When you’re certain that the printer is up to the task, you can proceed with
the printing operation in Word.
Preview Before You Print
Despite the fact that Word displays your document on the screen so that the
document appears pretty much how it will look when printed, I still recom-
mend that you try the Print Preview feature before printing.
126
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Print Preview is a word processing feature from the old days, back when text
on the screen looked nothing like what was printed. What Print Preview did
was to display an approximation of what a printed page of the document
would look like. That way, you could confirm things like margins, fonts, for-
mats, text sizes, headings, footers, and other parts of a document, stuff that
didn’t show up on the screen but would print on paper.
By taking a sneak peek at what your document looks like before printing, you
save yourself the time (and wasted paper) that you otherwise would spend
printing, proofing, and then printing again — or so the theory goes.
To sneak a preview of how your printed document will look, choose
Print➪Print Preview from the Office Button menu. Your document then
appears in the special Print Preview mode, as shown in Figure 10-1.
Take note of how your text looks on the page. Look at the margins. If you’re
using footnotes, headers, or footers, look at how they lay out. The idea here
is to spot something dreadfully wrong before you print.
Figure 10-1:
A document

127
Chapter 10: The Printer, the Paper, the Document Maker

When you’re done gawking, click the Close Print Preview button to return to
your document.
Or, if everything looks hunky and dory, click the Print button to summon the
Print dialog box, and refer to the next section.
 Note how the Page Setup group is visible in Print Preview mode. That
gives you fast access to some handy tools for fixing common problems
found in Print Preview: margins, paragraph spacing, document orienta-
tion, and so on. (Refer to Chapter 14 in this book.)
 Use the scroll bars to see more of your document.
 If you have a wheel mouse, like the Microsoft IntelliMouse, you can roll
the wheel up or down to scroll one page up or down in your document.
 If your mouse is wheel-less, you can use the Page Up and Page Down but-
tons to peruse various pages of your document.
 Click the mouse on your document to zoom in and get a closer look.
Click the mouse again to zoom back out. If this doesn’t work, click the
Magnifier check box in the Preview group.
 The Zoom tool on the Status bar can also be used to zoom in or out.
In fact, you can zoom out to where you see the entire document dis-
played as tiny pages on the screen.
 Sideways printing, paper sizes, and other document-related items are set
when you format your document’s pages. These are Word functions, not
ones you set when you print. Refer to Chapter 14.
Printing a Whole Document
All documents are printed the same, whether they’re absent notes to teachers,
heated screeds to editorial pages, company reports, or the next best-selling
novels to be turned into Tom Hanks movies. Generally speaking, here’s how
the printing operation goes:
1. Make sure that the printer is online and ready to print.
See the first section in this chapter, “Preparing the Printer.”
2. Save your document.
Ha! Surprised you. Saving before you print is always a good idea. Click
the little Save button for a quickie save, and if you need any extra help,
refer to Chapter 9, on saving your stuff to disk.
128
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

3. Choose the Print command from the Office Button menu to summon
the Print dialog box.
The Print dialog box (see Figure 10-2) provides a slew of printing
options, the most vital of which are covered elsewhere in this chapter.
4. Click the OK button.
The document begins to spew forth from your printer.
Printing may take some time; really, a long time. Fortunately, you can continue
working while the document prints, falling a page at a time from the printer.
 The keyboard shortcut to display the Print dialog box is Ctrl+P. I’ve made
lots of puns about Ctrl+P, which appear in previous editions of this book.
 If nothing prints, don’t hit the Print command again! There’s probably
nothing awry; the computer is still thinking or sending text to the
printer. If you don’t get an error message, everything will probably print,
eventually.
 The computer prints one copy of your document for every Print com-
mand you incant. If the printer is just being slow and you impatiently
click the Print button ten times, you get ten copies of your document.
See the section “Canceling a Print Job (Omigosh!),” later in this chapter.
 To print only a page, block, or other part of a document, refer to the
later section in this chapter “Printing Part of a Document.”
Figure 10-2:
The Print
dialog box.
129
Chapter 10: The Printer, the Paper, the Document Maker

 When your document is formatted using a unique paper size, the printer
may prompt you to load that paper size. Printing on paper of different
sizes is a printer-specific function, not something that Word does. But
you set the paper size in Word as part of the page formatting. Refer to
Chapter 14.
 Manual-feed printers beg for paper before they can print. The printer
may say something like “Feed me paper!” or the ever-popular “PC Load
Letter.” Like a dutiful mother, you must comply: Stand by the printer, line
up the paper, and shove it into the printer’s gaping maw until your docu-
ment is done printing. Fortunately, there’s no need to burp the printer
after manually feeding it paper.
 Aside from saving your document, you may consider proofreading it
before you print. See Chapter 8.
Printing backward
.txet drawkcab htiw od ot gnihton sah siht ,oN
Do you have one of those printers where the sheets come out face up? In that
case, have you noticed how you must reshuffle your document after it prints
because the pages are in order from back to front? Why are you doing that?
Don’t you have a computer? Aren’t computers supposed to make life easier?
Am I asking too many questions?
To prevent the face-up reshuffle, merely direct Word to print your document
backward. When you reverse the page order, your document finishes printing
face up, saving you time and making you look a lot smarter. Here’s how to
enact that blessing:
1. Summon the Print dialog box.
Do the Print-command-from-Office-Button jitterbug, the Ctrl+P thing, or
however you enjoy bringing forth the Print dialog box.
2. Click the Properties button in the Print dialog box.
The Properties dialog box for the selected printer appears.
3. On the Layout tab, Page Order area, select the option Back to Front.
4. Click OK.
5. Click OK to print your document.
The document comes out of the printer backward, but because it’s face
up, the document is in order when printing is complete.
130
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Printing a document quickly
To quickly print your document and avoid the Print dialog box, choose
Print➪Quick Print from the Office Button menu. you get no visual feedback,
no chance to change settings; the whole document prints.
Quick, of course, is relative. Just because the command is Quick Print doesn’t
mean that your printer spews out the pages any faster than it regularly
would.
Choosing another printer
Your computer can have more than one printer attached. Even small offices
and home offices have computers networked and sharing printers. In any
case, you can use the Print dialog box to choose which printer to use to print
your document. It’s simple.
After bringing forth the Print dialog box, choose a different printer from
the Name drop-down list. Click the downward-pointing arrow on the right
end of the Name box. A list of available printers appears, as shown in
Figure 10-3.
Figure 10-3:
Choosing
another

131
Chapter 10: The Printer, the Paper, the Document Maker

Simply choose a printer from the list. Click the OK button and your document
prints on the printer you’ve chosen.
 Yes, you also should check to ensure that the printer you’ve chosen is
on, selected, stocked with paper, and ready to print.
 Setting up or adding printers is something you do in Windows, not in
Word.
 Faxing works just like printing, although you’re printing to a fax machine
over a phone line. In Word, simply choose the fax printer from the list
of printers. (Installing a fax printer is something you do in Windows,
not in Word.)
 For more information on printing and faxing, I recommend my book
PCs For Dummies (Wiley).
Printing Part of a Document
Unless you tell Word otherwise, the whole document prints each time you
click the OK button in the Print dialog box. For those times when you need
only a single page, a range of pages, or a selected block of text, Word lets you
print just that part of the document. This section provides the details.
Printing a specific page
Follow these steps to print only one page of your document:
132
Part II: Word Processing Basics 
Deleting that extra, blank page 
at the end of a document
Occasionally, you may be surprised when your
document prints and there’s one, extra page —
a blank page. And, it bothers you because you
cannot get rid of it! Until now:
To remove that ugly, blank page that often roots
at the end of your document, press Ctrl+End.
With the insertion pointer at the end of your doc-
ument, keep pressing the Backspace key until
the extra page is gone. How can you tell? Keep
an eye on the total page count on the status bar.
When that page count is decremented by one,
you know that the extra page is gone.

1. Move the insertion pointer so that it’s sitting somewhere on the page
you want to print.
Check the page number on the status bar to ensure that you’re on the
right page.
2. Choose the Print command from the Office Button menu or press
Ctrl+P.
3. Select the Current Page option in the Print Range part of the Print
dialog box.
4. Click OK.
The dialog box closes, and that one page prints. (It may take some time
to print as Word organizes its thoughts.)
The single page prints with all the formatting you applied, including foot-
notes and page numbers and everything, just as though you plucked that
page from a complete printing of the entire document.
Printing a single page in this manner is great for when you goof up (or
the printer goofs up) one page in a document and you need to reprint
only that page. Printing only a single page doesn’t waste paper.
Printing a range of pages
Word enables you to print a single page, a range of pages, or even some
hodgepodge combination of random pages from within your document.
To print a range or group of pages, follow these steps:
1. Conjure up the Print dialog box.
2. Click the Pages button in the Page Range area of the Print dialog box.
3. Type the page numbers or a range of page numbers.
To print pages 3 through 5, for example, type 3-5.
To print pages 1 through 7, type 1-7.
To print pages 2 and 6, type 2,6.
4. Click OK.
The pages you specify — and only those pages — print.
You can get very specific with the page ranges. For example, to print page 3,
pages 5 through 9, pages 15 through 17, and page 19 (boy, that coffee went
everywhere, didn’t it?), you type 3, 5-9, 15-17, 19.
133
Chapter 10: The Printer, the Paper, the Document Maker

To print all the odd pages, or all the even pages, use the Print drop-down list
in the lower-left corner of the Print dialog box. Choose either Odd Pages or
Even Pages from that list. I’ve used this option to print on both sides of a
sheet of paper: First print all the odd pages. Then flip over the stack of pages,
reinsert them into the printer, and print all the even pages.
Printing a block
After you mark a block of text on-screen, you can beg the Print command to
print that block. Here’s how:
1. Mark the block of text you want to print.
See Chapter 7 for all the block-marking instructions in the world.
2. Choose the Print command from the Office Button menu.
3. Tickle the button by the word Selection.
The Selection item in the Print dialog box is available only when a block
is selected. Selecting it tells Word that you want to print only your high-
lighted block.
4. Click the OK button.
In a few moments, you see the hard copy sputtering out of your printer.
The page selection prints in the same position and with the same headers
and footers (if any) as it would if you had printed the entire document.
Printing More than One 
Copy of Something
Imagine how silly it would be to send your résumé to a company but add that
you need your résumé back because you have only one copy. No, I’m not
trying to convince you that buying a photocopier is necessary. Why do that
when Word can easily print multiple copies of any document? Here’s how:
1. Choose the Print command from the Office Button menu.
2. Enter the number of copies in the Number of Copies box.
For three copies, for example, type 3 into the box.
3. Click OK to print your copies.
134
Part II: Word Processing Basics 

Under normal circumstances, Word prints each copy of the document one
after the other. This process is known as collating. However, if you’re printing
seven copies of something and you want Word to print seven copies of page 1
and then seven copies of page 2 (and so on), click in the Collate check box to
remove the check mark. (Normally, you leave the check mark there.)
Canceling a Print Job (Omigosh!)
Because you probably need to quickly cancel your printing, here goes:
1. Double-click the li’l printer dude by the current time on the taskbar.
This step opens your printer’s window and displays any documents
waiting to be printed, as shown in Figure 10-4.
2. Click the name of your Word document job on the list.
3. Choose Document➪Cancel.
The command may be Document➪Cancel Printing in some versions of
Windows.
4. Click Yes to terminate the job.
The command may be OK in some versions of Windows.
5. Close the printer’s window when you’re done.
Choose Printer➪Close to make the window run away from the desktop.
You’re zapped back to Word, ready for more editing action.
Note that it may take a while for the printer to stop printing. That’s because
the printer has its own memory (RAM), and a few pages of the document may
be stored there and continue to print even after you’ve told the printer to
stop. (Stupid printer — stupid.)

queue.

Chapter 10: The Printer, the Paper, the Document Maker

 Stopping a print job is a Windows task, not really anything Word has
control over.
 If you’re using a network printer, you may not be able to cancel printing.
Oh, well.
 You can use your printer’s window (refer to Figure 10-4) to cancel more
jobs if you’re in an especially vicious mood: Just repeat Steps 2 through
4 for each job you want to sack.
 To cancel all the documents (the printer jobs) waiting to print, choose
Printer➪Cancel All Documents.
 Obviously, canceling a print job is the act of a desperate person. In its
efforts to make life easy for computer users, Windows tries hard to help
us change our minds. Canceling something that’s printing may or may
not work as planned. My advice is just to be careful with the Print com-
mand in the first place.

Formatting

In this part . . .
F
ormatting is the artist’s side of word processing. It’s
what gives your documents a professional, almost
typeset look. By properly formatting your text, sentences,
paragraphs, and pages, you kick up your document’s
appeal a notch, by adding to the value of what’s written.
In fact, forget what you’ve written — as long as it looks
good, who cares?
Seriously, formatting is the task of making your document
look less ugly. It’s something you do after you write, or if
you can handle the concept of styles and templates, you
can format while you write. The chapters in this part of
the book demonstrate how all that nonsense is done. If
you can survive the formatting task, you can truly do any-
thing in Word.

T
he most basic thing you can format in a document is text — the letters,
numbers, and characters you type. Just as your body is composed of mil-
lions of cells, documents are composed of thousands of characters. Like a
cell, a character is the basic building block of the document. Characters
include letters, symbols, and Uncle Lloyd, who can play The Blue Danube
waltz using only his cupped hand and his armpit.
You can format characters to be bold, underlined, italicized, little, or big or in
different fonts or colors — all sorts of pretty and distracting attributes. Word
gives you a magnificent amount of control over the appearance of your text.
This chapter contains the details.
How to Format Text
You can change the format of your text in two ways:
 Choose a text-formatting command first, and then type the text. All the
text you type is formatted as chosen.
 Type the text first, and then select the text as a block and apply the for-
matting. This technique works best when you’re busy with a thought
and need to return and format the text later.

You use both methods as you compose text in your document. Sometimes,
it’s easier to use a formatting command and type the text in that format.
For example:
1. Type the following text:
And we all had a
2. Press Ctrl+I to activate italic text.
3. Type this word:
horribly
4. Press Ctrl+I again, which turns off italic.
5. Continue typing:
awful time.
The final sentence looks like this:
And we all had a horribly awful time.
For more complex formatting, it’s better to type the text first, go back, mark
the text as a block, and then apply the formatting. Even so, either way works.
See Chapter 7 for more information on marking blocks of text.
Basic Text Formatting
Word stores some of the most common text-formatting commands in one
group. On the Home tab, you find the Font group, shown in Figure 11-1.
The command buttons in that group carry out most of the basic text format-
ting you use in Word. This section mulls over the possibilities.
Figure 11-1:
Text-
formatting
attributes in
the Font
group.
140
Part III: Formatting 

 Text can also be formatted by using the Mini Toolbar that appears when-
ever you select text. Refer to Chapter 7.
 The Font group can help you quickly determine which formatting is
applied to your text. For example, in Figure 11-1, the text where the
insertion pointer is blinking is formatted in the Calibri font. The number
12 tells you that the text is 12 points tall. If the B button were high-
lighted, you would also know that the text was formatted in bold.
(These text formats are discussed throughout this section.)
Changing the font
The most basic attribute of text is its typeface, often called the font. The font
sets up how your text looks — its overall text style. Although deciding on a
proper font may be agonizing, and indeed many graphic artists are paid well
to choose just the right font, the actual task of selecting a font in Word isn’t
that tough. It generally goes like this:
1. On the Write tab, in the Font group, click the down arrow to display
the Font face list.
A menu of font options appears, as shown in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2:
The Fonts
list.
141
Chapter 11: Formatting Text

The top part of the menu shows fonts associated with the document
theme. The next section contains fonts you’ve chosen recently, which 
is handy for reusing fonts. The rest of the list, which can be quite long,
shows all the fonts in Windows that are available to Word. It’s quite a
long list.
2. Scroll to the font you want.
The fonts in the All Fonts part of the list are displayed in context (as
they appear when printed) and in alphabetical order.
3. Click to select a font.
You can also use the Font menu to preview what fonts look like. Scroll
through the list to see which fonts are available and how they may look.
As you move the mouse over a font, any selected text in your document is
visually updated to show how that text would look in that font. (Note that no
changes are made until you select the new font.)
 When no font is displayed in the Font group (the listing is blank), it means
that more than one font is being used in the selected block of text.
 You can quickly scroll to a specific part of the menu by typing the first
letter of the font you need, such as T for Times New Roman.
 Graphic designers prefer to use two fonts in a document — one for the
text and one for headings and titles. Word is configured this way as well.
The font you see with Body after its name is the current text, or body,
font. The font marked as Heading is used for headings. These two fonts
are part of the document theme.
 Refer to Chapter 17 for more information on document themes.
 Fonts are the responsibility of Windows, not Word. New fonts are
installed in the Control Panel’s Fonts folder. (The procedure is really no
big deal.) Thousands of fonts are available for Windows, and they work
in all Windows applications.
Character formats (bold, italic, and so on)
The Font group lists some of the most common character formats. These are
applied in addition to the font. In fact, they enhance the font. Use them as
you see fit:
To make text bold, press Ctrl+B or click the Bold command button.
Use bold to make text stand out on a page — for titles and captions or when
you’re uncontrollably angry.
To make text italic, press Ctrl+I or click the Italic command button.
142
Part III: Formatting 

Italic is replacing underlining as the preferred text-emphasis format. Italicized
text looks so much better than shabby underlined text. It’s light and wispy,
poetic and free.
Underline text by pressing Ctrl+U or click the Underline command button.
When will this text attribute die? I’m baffled. Honestly, I think we’re waiting
for the last typewriter-clutching librarian from the 1950s to pass on before
underlining is officially gone as a text attribute. And please don’t fall prey to
the old rule about underlining book titles. It’s Crime and Punishment, not
Crime and Punishment.
Strike through text by clicking the Strikethrough command button. (There’s
no keyboard shortcut for this one.)
I don’t know why strikethrough text made it up on the Font group. If I were
King of Microsoft, I would have put Small Caps up there instead. But, who am
I? Strikethrough is common in legal stuff, and when you mean to say some-
thing but then change your mind, think of something better to say.
Make text subscript by pressing Ctrl+= (equal) or clicking the Subscript com-
mand button.
Subscript text appears below the line, such as the 2 in H2O. Again, it puzzles
me why this formatting command ranks up there with bold and italic. I sup-
pose that somewhere there’s a lot of subscripting going on.
Make text superscript by pressing Ctrl+Shift+= (equal sign) or clicking the
Superscript command button.
Superscript text appears above the line, such as the 10 in 210. Note that the
command is written as Ctrl++ (plus), but it’s really Ctrl+Shift+=. If you can
remember that Ctrl+= is subscript, just press the Shift key to get Ctrl+Shift+=
for superscript — if you can remember, that is.
More text formats are available in Word, such as small caps, outline, and
shadow. These can be accessed through the Font dialog box. Refer to the 
section “Fun and Formatting in the Font Dialog Box,” later in this chapter.
 To turn off a text attribute, use the command again. For example, press
Ctrl+I to type something in italic. Then press Ctrl+I again to return to
normal text.
 You can use the down arrow by the Underline command button to dis-
play a variety of underline styles and options. When a specific underline
style is chosen from the menu, using Ctrl+U or the Underline command
button applies that style.
 Basic character formatting affects only selected text or any new text
you type.
143
Chapter 11: Formatting Text

 You can mix and match character formats. For example, press Ctrl+B
and then Ctrl+I to have bold and italic text. You need to use Ctrl+B and
Ctrl+I, or the command buttons, to turn those attributes off again.
 Obviously, and logically, you cannot apply both superscript and sub-
script text attributes to the same chunk of text. That’s just silly.
 The best way to use superscript or subscript is to write your text first.
After the text is written, go back, mark as a block the text you want to
superscript or subscript, and then use these commands. So 42 becomes
42, and CnH2n+1OH becomes CnH2n+1OH.The reason is that the text you
modify tends to be rather teensy and hard to edit. Better to write it first
and then format.
Text Transcending Teeny to Titanic
Big text. Little text. Text! Text! Text!
Text size is considered a text format in Word. You can choose the size of your
text, from indecipherably small to monstrously huge. Of course, more
common is the subtle text-size adjustment; rare is the student who hasn’t
fudged the length of a term paper by inching up the text size a notch or two.
To understand how Word (and Windows) deals with text size, you must
become one with an official typesetting term: point. Text size is measured by
the point, where one point is equal to 1⁄72 inch.
Here are some point pointers:
 The bigger the point size, the larger the text.
 Most text is either 10 or 12 points tall.
 Headings are typically 14 to 24 points tall.
 Most fonts can be sized from 1 point to 1,638 points. Point sizes smaller
than 6 are generally too small for a human to read.
 Seventy-two points is equal to 1-inch-high letters (roughly).
 The point size of text is a measure from the bottom of the descender to
the top of the ascender — from the bottom of the lowercase p to the top
of the capital E, for example. So, the typical letter in a font is smaller
than the given font size. In fact, depending on the font design, text for-
matted at the same size but with different fonts (typefaces) may not
appear to be the same size. That’s just one of those typesetting oddities
that causes regular computer users to start binge drinking.
144
Part III: Formatting 

Setting the text size
Text size is set in the Font group on the Home tab. Just to the right of the
Font box is the Size box (refer to Figure 11-1). Clicking the down arrow dis-
plays a list of font sizes for your text, as shown in Figure 11-3.
You can preview the new text size by pointing the mouse at an item on the
Size menu. The word under the insertion pointer, or a selected block of text,
is updated on the screen to reflect the new size. Click to choose a size or
press Esc to cancel.
The Size menu lists only common text sizes. To set the text size to something
not listed or to something specific, type that value into the box. For example,
to set the font size to 11.5, click in the Size box and type 11.5.
Nudging text size
Sometimes, choosing text size is like hanging a picture. To get the picture
level, you have to nudge it just a little bit this way and that. Word has similar
tools for nudging text size larger or smaller, two of which are found on in the
Font group.
To increase the font size, press Ctrl+Shift+> or click the Grow Font command
button.
The Grow Font command nudges the font size up to the next value as listed
on the Size menu (refer to Figure 11-3). So, if the text is 12 points, the Grow
Font command increases its size to 14 points.
Figure 11-3:
Select a font
size from
this list.
145
Chapter 11: Formatting Text

To decrease the font size, press Ctrl+Shift+< or click the Shrink Font com-
mand button.
The Shrink Font command works in the opposite direction of the Grow Font
command, by reducing the text size to the next-lower value as displayed on
the Size menu (refer to Figure 11-3).
I remember the Grow and Shrink keyboard commands easily because > is the
greater-than symbol and < is the less-than symbol. Just think, “I’m making my
text greater than its current size” when you press Ctrl+Shift+> or “I’m making
my text less than its current size” when you press Ctrl+Shift+<.
When you want to increase or decrease the font size by smaller increments,
use the following shortcut keys:
Ctrl+]
Makes text one point size larger
Ctrl+[
Makes text one point size smaller
More Colorful Text Makes Not 
for More Colorful Writing
Now that color printers are pretty much standard, you can take advantage of
those expensive ink pots by using colored text in Word. Color can add per-
sonality to your correspondence, provide punch in a business letter, or make
an important document extremely difficult to read. Choose your text color
wisely.
Text color is applied by clicking the Font Color command button. The bar
below the A on the Font Color command button indicates which color is
applied to text.
A new color can be chosen by clicking the menu arrow just to the right of the
Font Color command button. Choose a color from the menu, as shown in
Figure 11-4; as you move the mouse pointer over various colors, selected text
in your document is updated to reflect that color. When you find the color
you like, click it. That color then becomes the new text color associated with
the Font Color command button.
146
Part III: Formatting 

Of course, colored text prints only when a color printer is available and read-
ily stocked with ink. Refer to Chapter 10 for more information on printing
documents.
 Theme colors are associated with the document theme. Refer to
Chapter 17.
 Select the More Colors item to display a special Colors dialog box. Use
that dialog box to craft your own custom colors.
 The color Automatic refers to the color defined for the text style you’re
using. Refer to Chapter 16 for more information on styles.
 The Font Color command affects only the text color, not the background.
To color the background, you need to use the Shading command, which
is covered in Chapter 19.
 Be careful not to confuse the Font Color command button with the Text
Highlight Color command button, to its left. Text highlighting is a text
attribute, but it’s best used for document markup. See Chapter 27.
Undoing All This Text-Formatting
Nonsense
There are so many formatting commands available that it’s possible for your
text to look more like a pile of formatting remnants than anything readable in
any human language. Word understands this problem, so it created the Clear
Formatting command to let you peel away all formats from your text, just like
you peel the skin from a banana:
Figure 11-4:
Selecting
a color for
the text.
147
Chapter 11: Formatting Text

To peel away formatting from a block of selected text, or the text the inser-
tion pointer is on, or future text you type, press Ctrl+spacebar or use the
Clear Formatting command button in the Font group.
The Clear Formatting command removes any formats you’ve applied to the
text: font, size, text attributes (bold or italic), and color.
 Another key combination for Ctrl+spacebar is Ctrl+Shift+Z. Remember
that Ctrl+Z is the Undo command. To undo formatting, all you do is add
the Shift key, which may make sense — well, heck, if any of this makes
sense.
 Technically, the Ctrl+spacebar command restores characters to the for-
matting defined by the style you’re using. So, if the Body style is 12-point
Calibri, pressing Ctrl+spacebar restores that font and size. Don’t let
this information upset or confuse you! Instead, turn to Chapter 16 for
more information on Word’s styles.
Fun and Formatting in 
the Font Dialog Box
There’s a place in Word where all your font-formatting delights are kept in a
neatly organized fashion. It’s the Font dialog box, shown in Figure 11-5.
To summon the Font dialog box, click the Dialog Box Launcher button in the
lower-right corner of the Font group or press Ctrl+D.
The Font dialog box contains all the commands for formatting text, even
quite a few that didn’t find their way into the Font group.
Please note the lovely Preview window, at the bottom of the Font dialog box.
This window allows you to preview changes to your text. One of my pastimes
is to continuously select fonts in the Font dialog box to see what they look
like in the Preview window.
When you’re done setting up your font stuff, click the OK button. Or, click
Cancel if you’re just visiting.
 The best benefit of the Font dialog box is the Preview window, at the
bottom. That window shows you exactly how your choices affect text in
your document.
 You select the Underline attribute from the Underline Style drop-down
list. Word can do several types of underlining.
148
Part III: Formatting 

 The Font names +Body and +Heading refer to the fonts selected by the
current document theme. This is done so that you can use Word’s theme
commands to quickly change body and heading fonts for an entire docu-
ment all at once.
 Save the festive attributes — such as Shadow, Outline, Emboss, or
Engrave — for titles and headings.
 The Character Spacing tab displays advanced options for changing the
size and position of text on a line.
 Changes you make in the Font dialog box affect any marked block on the
screen or any new text you type after you close the Font dialog box.
 The Font dialog box can also be accessed from the Find dialog box or
the Find and Replace dialog box. This helps you to search for, or search
and replace, specific text formatting in a document.
 You can mark all similar text formatting in a document as a block by
right-clicking a bit of text and choosing Styles➪Select Text with Similar
Formatting. That way, you can universally change similar text in a docu-
ment without doing a search-and-replace for text formats. Also see
Chapter 7 for more block-marking information.
 The Default button in the Font dialog box is used to change the font that
Word uses when you’re starting up a new document. If you prefer to use
a specific font for all your documents, choose the font (plus other text
attributes) in the Font dialog box, and then click the Default button.
Click the Yes button to answer the question about changing the Normal
template. Afterward, all your documents start with the new default font
you’ve selected.

Text-attribute effects roundup
Bold and italic are the most common ways to dress up a character. Beyond that, Word has a buck-
etful of character attributes you can apply to your text. This table shows the lot of them:

* Note the difference between word underline and continuous underline.
Hidden text is good for what it says — hiding text in a document. Of course, you don’t see the text
on-screen, either. To show the hidden text, click the Show/Hide command button (in the Paragraph
Group on the Write tab) as described in Chapter 2, in the section about spots and clutter in your
text. The hidden text shows up in the document with a dotted underline.

Changing the CASE of Text
Believe it or not, upper- and lowercase do have something to do with a font.
Back in the old mechanical-type days, fonts came in a case, like a briefcase.
The top part of the case, the upper case, held the capital letters. The bottom
part of the case held the lowercase letters. So, in a way, changing the case of
text is kind of a font-formatting trick.
To change the case of text in Word, use the Change Case command button in
the Font group. Choosing that button displays a menu of options, shown in
Figure 11-6. Select the text you want to change, and then choose the proper
item from the Change Case command button. Your text is modified to match
the menu item that’s selected.
You can also use the Shift+F3 command to change the case of selected text.
But that keyboard shortcut cycles between only three of the menu options
shown in Figure 11-6: ALL CAPS, lowercase, and Capitalize Each Word.

P
aragraphs are goodly sized chunks of text. In school, you were probably
taught that a paragraph must be one or more sentences expressing a
thought. Or something. Anyway, I view a paragraph, formatting-wise, as a ver-
itable text sandwich, bulky enough to qualify for its own round of formatting
commands: A paragraph has left and right margins, a top and a bottom, a
before and an after, plus space in the middle.
Word provides ample tools for formatting paragraphs of text. There’s a
simple way, for example, to automatically indent the first line of a paragraph.
Imagine! That and other amazing formatting tricks, all designed to impress
and inspire, are found in this handy chapter.
How to Format a Paragraph
You can format a paragraph in Word several ways:

 Use a paragraph-formatting command, and then type a new paragraph in
that format.
 Use the formatting command in a single paragraph to format that 
paragraph. (Place the insertion pointer in a paragraph, and then use
a formatting command.)
 Use the formatting command on a block of selected paragraphs to
format them all together.
Here’s an example for you to mess with:
1. Type the following paragraph:
It was a crushing blow. Francis had practiced her
lines all week. Her mother had finished the costume.
Even her brothers were impressed, commenting that she
really was Chicken Little. But all that meant nothing
now. While she sat in the bathtub, her father broke
the terrible news: “I’m sorry, Francis. But you have
the chicken pox.”
Did you remember to press Enter to end the paragraph? That’s important.
2. Move the insertion pointer so that it’s somewhere amid the para-
graph’s text.
3. Press Ctrl+E.
Ctrl+E is the keyboard shortcut for the Center command, which centers
the paragraph’s text from left to right on the page.
4. Press Ctrl+L.
The paragraph is left justified, undoing the centering.
5. Press Ctrl+T.
The paragraph is now formatted with a hanging indent.
6. Press Shift+Ctrl+T.
And the hanging indent is gone.
Hopefully, that little demo gets you in the mood for understanding how para-
graph formatting works. The commands used in these steps are explained
elsewhere in this chapter.
 A paragraph is a chunk of text that ends when you press the Enter key.
Paragraph-formatting commands work only on paragraphs, not on sen-
tences or individual words. Of course, if your paragraph is only a single
word or sentence, that’s okay.
 Refer to Chapter 7 for specific and entertaining block-marking 
instructions.
154
Part III: Formatting 

 You can format all the paragraphs in a document by first selecting the
entire document. The quick way to do that is to press the Ctrl+A key
combination.
 To format individual characters or the text inside a paragraph, refer to
Chapter 11.
 Some folks like to see the Enter key symbol (¶) in their documents, visu-
ally marking the end of each paragraph. You can do this in Word by
clicking the Word Options button on the Office Button menu. Click
Display on the left side of the Word Options dialog box. On the right
side, put a check mark by Paragraph Marks. Click OK. Now, every time
you press the Enter key, a ¶ symbol appears at the end of the paragraph.
Where the Paragraph Formatting
Commands Lurk
Word smuggled some of the most popular paragraph-formatting commands
into the Paragraph group, found on the Home tab. Figure 12-1 illustrates the
Paragraph group, although you should note that Word may show a different
arrangement of the command buttons depending on your computer’s screen
width.
In an odd twist, indenting and paragraph spacing is found in another
Paragraph group, this one on the Page Layout tab, shown in Figure 12-2.

Layout tab.

Chapter 12: Formatting Paragraphs

Because many of the paragraph-formatting commands require you to enter
values, there also exists a Paragraph dialog box, shown in Figure 12-3. There,
you find some finer controls that the command buttons just don’t offer.
To summon the Paragraph dialog box, click the Dialog Box Launcher button,
found in the lower-right corner of the Paragraph group. Or, you can use the
forgettable keyboard shortcut Alt+H, P, G.
The commands in the various paragraph-formatting locations are covered
throughout the rest of this chapter.
Click the Cancel button or press the Esc key to dismiss the Paragraph
dialog box.
The Mini Toolbar, which shows up after you select text, also contains a 
smattering of paragraph-formatting buttons. Refer to Chapter 7 for more
information on the Mini Toolbar.
Paragraph Justification and Alignment
Paragraph alignment has nothing to do with politics, and justification has
nothing to do with the right or wrong of how paragraphs are formatted.
Instead, both terms refer to how the left and right edges of the paragraph

look on a page. There are four options: Left, Center, Right, and Fully Justified,
each covered in this section.
Line up on the left!
Much to the pleasure of southpaws the world over, left-aligning a paragraph
is considered normal. That’s the way the old typewriter used to do things:
The left side of the paragraph is all even and tidy, and the right side is jagged,
not lined up.
To left-align a paragraph, press Ctrl+L or click the Align Left command
button.
 This type of alignment is also known as ragged right.
 Left-aligning a paragraph is how you “undo” the other types of alignment.
Everyone center!
Centering a paragraph places each line in that paragraph in the middle of the
page, with an equal amount of space to the line’s right or left.
To center a paragraph, press Ctrl+E or use the Center command button.
 Centering is ideal for titles and single lines of text. It’s ugly for para-
graphs and makes reading your text more difficult.
 You can center a single word in the middle of a line by using the center
tab. Refer to Chapter 13 for the details.
Line up on the right!
A right-aligned paragraph has its right margin nice and even. The left margin,
however, is jagged. When do you use this type of formatting? I have no idea,
but it sure feels funky typing a right-aligned paragraph.
To flush your text along the right side of the page, press Ctrl+R or click the
Align Right command button.
 This type of alignment is also known as ragged left or flush right.
 You can right-justify text on a single line by using a right-align tab. Refer
to Chapter 13 for more info.
157
Chapter 12: Formatting Paragraphs

Full justification! (Full justification —
aye, sir!)
Full justification occurs when both the left and right sides of a paragraph are
lined up neat and tidy, flush with the margins.
To give your paragraph full justification, press Ctrl+J or click the Justify com-
mand button.
 Fully justified paragraph formatting is often used in newspapers and
magazines, which makes the thin columns of text easier to read.
 Word makes each side of the paragraph line up by inserting tiny slivers
of extra space between the words in a paragraph.
Making Room Before, After, or 
Inside Your Paragraphs
Word lets you add air to the space before, after, and in the middle of your
paragraphs. Traditionally, the line spacing command lets you add room
between the lines of text within a paragraph. From the typesetting planet,
your word processor lets you add space before and after each paragraph.
Combine these two commands and you have a great deal of control over how
tall or tight your paragraph text can be.
Traditional line spacing
Changing the line spacing inserts extra space between all lines of text in a
paragraph. Word adds the space, or extra blank lines, below each line of text
in the paragraph. That means that line spacing also affects the space between
paragraphs.
The Line Spacing command button displays a menu listing common line-
spacing commands, as shown in Figure 12-4. Choose a new line-spacing value
from that list to change the line spacing for the current paragraph or all the
paragraphs selected as a block.
158
Part III: Formatting 

Before Word 2007, line spacing was preset to 1.0 in Word. Note in Figure 12-4,
as well as in your documents, that the setting is now 1.15, which is suppos-
edly more readable and also a blessing to term-paper writers all over.
 Double spacing, or the line spacing value 2.0, means that one line of text
appears with one blank line below it. Triple spacing, 3.0, means that one
line of text appears with two blank lines below.
 Ah! The keyboard shortcuts:
• To single-space, press Ctrl+1.
• To double-space, press Ctrl+2.
• To use 11⁄2-spaced lines, press Ctrl+5.
 Yes, Ctrl+5 means 11⁄2-line spacing, not 5-line spacing. Use the 5 key on
the typewriter part of the computer keyboard. Using the 5 key on the
numeric keypad activates the Select All command.
 I know some fussy editors, old-school types, who want everything triple-
spaced so that they can scribble comments between the lines.
 As with justification, there’s no such thing as no line spacing. If you want
to “remove” fancy line spacing, select the text and press Ctrl+1 for single
spacing.
More line spacing options
To set the line spacing to something specific, you need to call on the Paragraph
dialog box, as described earlier in this chapter and shown in Figure 12-3.
In the Spacing part of the dialog box, the Line Spacing drop-down list is used
to set various line-spacing values: Single, 1.5, and Double, just like the Line
Spacing command button’s menu.
Figure 12-4:
Choose line
spacing
from this
menu.
159
Chapter 12: Formatting Paragraphs

Additional options in the Line Spacing drop-down list require you to also
use the At box. Values you set in the At box indicate line spacing as
described here:
 At least: The line spacing is set to the specified value, which Word treats
as a minimum value. Word can disobey that value and add more space
whenever necessary to make room for larger type or different fonts on
the same line of text.
 Exactly: Word uses the specified line spacing and doesn’t adjust the
spacing to accommodate for larger text.
 Multiple: This option is used to enter line-spacing values other than
those specified in the drop-down list. For example, to set the line spac-
ing to 4, choose Multiple from the Line Spacing drop-down list and type
4 in the At box. Word’s 1.15 line spacing value is set with the Multiple
option.
You can specify values in the At box in increments of 0.1. So, when you want
to tighten up text on a page, select all the paragraphs on that page, choose
Multiple from the Line Spacing drop-down list, and then type 0.9 in the At box.
Or, to add more room subtly, type 1.2.
Click the OK button to confirm your settings and close the Paragraph
dialog box.
That space between paragraphs
It’s really a silly thing to do: Press Enter twice to end a paragraph. People say
that they need the extra space between the paragraphs, but what they don’t
realize is that Word can add that space for you, automatically. Here’s how:
1. Position the insertion pointer in the paragraph that you want more air
around, or mark a block of paragraphs to affect them all.
2. Check the point size of your text.
It’s listed on the Home tab, in the Font group.
3. Click the Page Layout tab.
4. Use the After button in the Paragraph group to add space after the
paragraph.
As you adjust the value, the paragraph (or paragraphs) grow extra 
spacing.
For example, if your text size is 12, click the up arrow by After until the value
12 appears in the box. This adds 12 points, or one blank line, of space after
each paragraph you type.
160
Part III: Formatting 

The space you add to the paragraph becomes part of its format, just like line
spacing would, although the space afterward appears only after the para-
graph’s text. (You can see this space if you select the paragraph as a block.)
Most of the time, space is added following a paragraph, as just described.
Word also lets you add space before a paragraph. For example, you could
do this to further separate a paragraph from a heading or graphical image.
To add the space before, repeat the preceding steps and put a value into the
Before box in Step 4.
 You can manually enter values in the After (or Before) box. But remem-
ber that the values are points, not inches or potrzebies.
 This trick is a great way to spread out a list of bullet points or numbered
steps without affecting the line spacing within the bullet points or steps.
 Refer to Chapter 11 for more information points as they relate to
text size.
 Adding space before or after a paragraph isn’t the same as double-spacing
the text inside the paragraph. In fact, adding space around a paragraph
doesn’t change the paragraph’s line spacing.
Paragraph Indentation
Do you suffer from the shame of manual paragraph indenting? It’s a hidden
secret. Yes, even though computers enjoy doing things automatically, too
many Word users still begin a paragraph of text by pressing the Tab key.
It’s ugly, but it’s something that must be discussed.
Word can indent your paragraphs for you just as easily as you can indent
your car door in a crowded mall parking lot. This section discusses various
paragraph-indenting options.
Indenting the first line of a paragraph
To have Word automatically indent the first line of every paragraph you type,
heed these steps:
1. Conjure up the Paragraph dialog box.
Refer to the section “Where the Paragraph Formatting Commands Lurk,”
earlier in this chapter, for proper conjuring incantations plus a bonus
picture of what the Paragraph dialog box looks like (refer to Figure 12-3).
2. In the Indentation area, locate the Special drop-down list.
3. Select First Line from the list.
161
Chapter 12: Formatting Paragraphs

4. Optionally, enter an amount in the By box.
Unless you’ve messed with things, the box should automatically say
0.5”, which means that Word automatically indents the first line of
every paragraph a half-inch — a tab stop. Type another value if you
want your indents to be more or less outrageous. (Things are measured
here in inches, not in points.)
5. Click OK.
The selected block, or the current paragraph (and the remaining para-
graphs you type), all automatically have an indented first line.
To remove the first-line indent from a paragraph, repeat these steps and
select (none) from the drop-down list in Step 3. Then click the OK button.
Word’s AutoCorrect feature can perform these steps for you, but it’s tricky.
First you must type the paragraph. Then go back to the start of the para-
graph and press the Tab key. This instantly fixes the paragraph’s indentation
(if AutoCorrect is on), and you see the AutoCorrect icon on the screen. Here’s
the secret: Ignore the AutoCorrect icon and your paragraph indenting is
fixed. Ta-da!
There are two ways to separate paragraphs from each other in a document.
The first is to add space between each paragraph, which is covered in the
earlier section “That space between paragraphs.” The second way is to
indent each paragraph’s first line, as covered in this section. Choose one or
the other; you don’t need to use both.
Making a hanging indent
A hanging indent isn’t in imminent peril, nor can it affect the outcome of an
election. Instead, it’s a paragraph in which the first line sticks out to the left
and the rest of the paragraph is indented. It’s a preferred way to present para-
graph lists — like this:
Door-proof. The answer to the question whether the cat
wants in or out is always yes. The cat merely
wants to be on the other side of the door. We
at KittySmart have finally bred that annoyance
out of our cats.
To create such a beast, position the insertion pointer in the paragraph you
want to hang and indent. Press Ctrl+T, the Hanging Indent keyboard shortcut.
Because you probably won’t remember Ctrl+T all the time (who could?),
paragraphs can also be hanged and indented in the Paragraph dialog box.
Use the steps from the preceding section, but in Step 3 choose Hanging from
the drop-down list.
162
Part III: Formatting 

 The hanging indent is really an indent-everything-but-the-first-line-of-the-
paragraph type of indent.
 To undo a hanging indent, press Ctrl+Shift+T. That’s the un-hang key
combination, and it puts your paragraph’s neck back in shape.
Indenting a whole paragraph
Just as you can indent the first line of a paragraph, you can indent every line
of a paragraph, by moving the paragraph’s left margin over to the right a
notch, just like Mr. Bunny: Hop, hop, hop. This technique is popular for
typing block quotes or nested paragraphs.
To indent a paragraph one tab stop from the left, press Ctrl+M or click the
Increase Indent command button in the Home tab’s Paragraph group.
To unindent an indented paragraph, press Ctrl+Shift+M or click the Decrease
Indent command button in the Home tab’s Paragraph group.
Each time you use the Increase Indent command, the paragraph’s left edge
hops over one tab stop (typically, one half-inch). To undo this and shuffle the
paragraph back to the left, use the Decrease Indent command.
 You cannot decrease the indent beyond the left margin.
 The indent isn’t affected by the paragraph’s alignment. These com-
mands affect only the paragraph’s left margin.
 To indent both the left and right sides of a paragraph, use the Paragraph
dialog box and set both left and right indents to the same value.
 Although the Ctrl+M and Ctrl+Shift+M shortcuts aren’t mnemonic,
their only difference is a Shift key. So, after you get used to using them
(hopefully, before the afterlife), they’re easy to remember.
Setting the paragraph margins
A paragraph of text in Word sits snugly between the page’s left and right mar-
gins. Those margins can be broken or extended, allowing you to indent the
left and right sides of one or more paragraphs however you want. The secret
is found in the Page Layout tab’s Paragraph group.
The Left item sets the indentation for the paragraph’s left edge.
The Right item sets the indentation for the paragraph’s right edge.
163
Chapter 12: Formatting Paragraphs

Setting positive values moves the edges inward. Setting negative values
moves the edges outward. When the values are set to zero, the paragraph’s
margins match the page’s margin.
For example, to double-indent a paragraph as a block quote, you could
move both the left and right margins in by 8⁄10 of an inch. Here’s how that 
happens:
1. Put the insertion pointer in the paragraph or just select multiple para-
graphs as a block.
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
3. In the Paragraph group, enter .8 in the Left box.
You can type .8 in the box or use the spinner gizmo to enter .8. (The spin-
ner increments or decrements in 1⁄10-inch values.)
4. Enter .8 in the Right box.
For a greater indent, enter a larger value in both the Left and Right boxes.
Or, to undo an indent, enter 0 in both boxes.
 Refer to Chapter 14 for more information on the page margins.
 When you’re formatting facing pages, with inside and outside margins,
it helps to use the Paragraph dialog box. (Refer to Figure 12-3.) Use the
Mirror Indents item to set the inside (toward the fold between the pages)
and outside (toward the edges) margins so that an indented paragraph
on one page mirrors the paragraph on the opposite page.
 Do not try to mix left and right indenting with a first-line indent or hang-
ing indent while drowsy or while operating heavy equipment.
Who Died and Made This Thing Ruler?
The Paragraph dialog box can be a daunting place, what with all the
numbers and terminology and such. A more graphical, and therefore more
fun, way to manipulate a paragraph’s indentation and margins is to use the
Ruler.
The Ruler may be hidden in your copy of Word. To show it, click the View
Ruler button, found atop the vertical (right) scroll bar.
The Ruler appears on the top of the writing part of the Word window, shown
in Figure 12-5. In Print Layout view, a vertical ruler also shows up and runs
down the left side of the window. (That ruler is just for show.)
164
Part III: Formatting 

The dark gray part of the Ruler (outside ends) is beyond the margins that are
set for the page. The lighter gray is inside the page margins, and the Ruler
measures that space from the left, starting with zero inches.
On the ruler you find four gizmos that control paragraph indenting: one
downward-pointing triangle, two upward-pointing triangles, and one block.
Those gizmos reflect the current paragraph formatting, and they can be
manipulated with the mouse to change the formatting. Here’s what they 
control:
To adjust a paragraph’s right edge, grab the Right Indent guy on the ruler and
drag him right or left.
To adjust the paragraph’s left edge, grab the Left Indent thing on the ruler
and slide it to the left or right. Note that this gizmo moves both the Hanging
Indent and First Line Indent guys together.
The paragraph’s first line can be set independently of the left edge by drag-
ging the First Line Indent doojobbie to the left or right.
The Hanging Indent thing controls all the paragraph’s lines except for the
first one. Normally, you don’t mess with this gizmo: Use the Left Indent guy to
set the paragraph’s left margin. The exception is for creating a hanging
indent, which is probably why this gizmo has such a clever name.
 The Ruler measures from the left margin, not from the left edge of
the page.
 The left margin is set when you format a page of text. See Chapter 14.
 The Tab gizmo is used to set the various tab stops used in Word. This
confusing and frustrating subject is covered in Chapter 13.
 The Ruler is fine for visually setting indents, but when you need to be
precise, use the Paragraph dialog box.

M
ost people have an issue with tabs in Word. I agree: The topic and the
method can be maddening, like seeing Aunt Eunice pour cheap ketchup
over her delicious homemade meatloaf. It’s really a philosophical thing:
When you deal with tabs, you’re dealing with the tab character and the tab
stop. They go hand in hand. Understand that and you’re well on your way to
becoming a tenth-level tab master in Word.
Tabs are really part of paragraph formatting, but the topic frustrates so many
Word users that I decided to dedicate this entire chapter to the subject of set-
ting tabs.
The Story of Tab
On my ancient Underwood typewriter, the Tab key is on the right side of the
keyboard and is named Tabular Key. Elsewhere, I’ve seen it named Tabulator.
In each case, the root word is table. The Tab key is used to help build tables
or to organize information in a tabular way.

Pressing the Tab key inserts a tab character into your document. That tab
character works like a wide space character, but its size is determined by the
tab stop. The tab stop is a predefined location marked across a page — say,
every half-inch — although in Word you can set tab stops at any interval.
It’s the tab stop that makes the Tab key work: Press the Tab key, and the
insertion pointer hops over to the next tab stop. That way, you can line up
text on multiple lines with tabs and tab stops, keeping things nice and even —
definitely much nicer than trying to fudge lining up text with the spacebar.
 Pressing the Tab key doesn’t insert spaces. When you use Backspace or
Delete to remove a tab, you delete one character — the tab character.
 It’s best to format tabs for a single line of text or for only the first line of
a paragraph. For anything more complex, use Word’s Table command.
See Chapter 20.
 It helps to have the Ruler visible when you work with tabs. Refer to
Chapter 12.
 Always use the Tab key when you mean to indent or align text in a docu-
ment. The worst thing you can do is press the spacebar. That is so
wrong! In fact, anytime you press the spacebar more than once, you
need a tab. Believe me, your documents will look prettier and you’ll be
happier after you understand and use tabs rather than spaces.
 Tab characters can often confuse you because, like spaces, they don’t
show up on the screen. But you can see them, if you like. To direct Word
to display the tab character, which looks like a tiny arrow, as shown in
the margin, click the Word Options button on the Office Button menu.
Click Display from the left side of the Word Options dialog box. On the
right side of the window, put a check mark by Tab Characters. Click OK.
 The diet beverage Tab was named for people who like to keep a tab on
what they consume.
The Tab Stops Here
The Tab key works because of tab stops. So, using the Tab key really means
setting a tab stop at a certain position in a line of text. That seems simple
enough, if it weren’t for two problems: Setting tab stops isn’t the most logical
thing in Word, and there are five different types of tab stops.
The handiest way to set tab stops in Word is to use the Ruler, shown in
Figure 13-1. The tab stops appear as tiny black symbols clinging to the
bottom of the Ruler, shown in the figure. As you may guess, these tab stops
are easily set and manipulated by moving the mouse.
168
Part III: Formatting 

Here are the five types of tab stops available on the Ruler:
The left tab is the traditional type of tab stop.
The center tab centers text, mostly for titles or headers.
The right tab right-justifies text.
The decimal tab aligns numbers by their decimal parts.
The bar tab isn’t a tab stop at all, but, rather, a decorative ornament.
Setting a tab involves two steps. First, you select one of these tabs from the
Tab gizmo on the left end of the Ruler. Clicking the Tab gizmo displays a dif-
ferent tab type. (The Tab gizmo also displays some of the paragraph-indent
symbols, covered in Chapter 12.) The second step is to click the mouse on
the Ruler at the exact spot where you want the tab stop set. To set a left tab
stop, you choose the left tab from the Tab gizmo and then click the ruler
where you want that tab stop positioned. Click the 3-inch mark, and the
plump L of the left tab stop settles down at that position nicely.
 Using and setting each of these tab stops listed in this section is covered
elsewhere in this chapter.
 Tabs are paragraph-level things. Setting tabs affects only the paragraph
that the toothpick cursor is blinking in. To set the tabs for several para-
graphs, you must first select them as a block. Refer to Chapter 7 for
more blocky stuff.
 Figure 13-1 shows three tab stops set: A left tab stop at the half-inch
mark, a center tab stop at the 3-inch mark, and a right tab stop at the 
51⁄2-inch mark.
 When you’re selecting several paragraphs, you may spot a light gray or
phantom tab stop on the ruler. That indicates a tab stop set in one para-
graph, but not all. To apply the tab stop to all selected paragraphs, click
the phantom tab stop once. Otherwise, you can remove the tab stop
per the instructions found in this chapter’s later section “Unsetting a
Tab Stop.”

Chapter 13: Setting Tabs

The Standard Left Tab Stop
The left tab stop is the traditional type of tab stop. When you press the Tab
key, the insertion pointer advances to the left tab stop, where you can con-
tinue to type text. This works best for typing lists, for organizing information
on a single line paragraph, or when you want to indent the first line of a multi-
line paragraph. This section provides some examples.
The tabbed list
A common use for the tab stop is to create a simple two-column list, as
shown in Figure 13-2.
The following steps describe how to easily set up such a list:
1. On a new line, press Tab.
2. Type the item for the first column.
It works best when this is a short item, two or three words max.
3. Press Tab.
4. Type the item for the second column.
Again, this should be something short.
5. Press Enter to end that line and start a new line.
Yes, your list looks horrible! Don’t worry. It’s more important to get the
data typed first and then format it second.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 for each item in the list.
After the list is finished, setting the tab stops is done visually by using
the ruler.
Figure 13-2:

column list.

Part III: Formatting 

7. Summon the ruler, if necessary.
Click the View Ruler button to display the ruler if it’s hidden.
8. Select all the lines of text that you want to organize into a two-column
tabbed list.
Refer to Chapter 7 for more information on marking blocks of text.
9. Click the Tab gizmo until the Left Tab icon appears.
If it already shows up in the Tab gizmo, you’re set to go.
You can see what a Left Tab icon looks like right here in the margin.
10. Click the mouse on the Ruler at the number 1, the 1-inch position.
This step sets a left tab stop at one inch. You see how the text you
selected immediately falls into place.
11. Click the mouse to set a second tab stop at the 3-inch mark.
The list looks nice and even, in two columns (refer to Figure 13-2).
12. Adjust the tab stops if necessary.
Slide the tab stops left or right on the ruler as needed to help clean
up your list. As you slide the tab stops, do you notice how a dashed 
vertical line extends through your text? That shows you where text
lines up.
These steps can also be used to create a three- or even a four-column list.
The idea is to keep the text brief, on one line, and separated by single tabs.
Then use the tab stops on the ruler to line things up and make them pretty.
Here are the key points to remember here:
 You need only one tab between items in a column list. That’s because:
It’s the tab stop, not the tab character, that lines up your text. As with
using two spaces in a row, you never really need two tabs in a row.
 You type the text first and then select the text and set the tab stops last.
 The tab stops can be adjusted for the entire block of text by using the
mouse and the ruler.
 For a tabbed list to work, each paragraph must be a line by itself,
and the items in each column should be only a word or two long. Any
longer, and you need to use Word’s Table command, as covered in
Chapter 20.
171
Chapter 13: Setting Tabs

The tab-tab-paragraph thing
Tabs can also be used to form an item list where the paragraph text is kept in
the rightmost column. Figure 13-3 shows how the tab-tab-paragraph thing
works. It combines both paragraph- and tab-formatting skills.
Follow these steps to create something similar:
1. On a new line, type the item for the first column.
The shorter, the better.
2. Press Tab.
3. Type the second column’s text and press Tab.
This step is optional; it’s possible to create a simpler tab-paragraph
list, which looks just like Figure 13-3, but without the Planet column
(and spaced accordingly).
4. Type the paragraph text.
Unlike with the first two items, you’re free to type more text here. That’s
because this final paragraph column will wrap, as shown in Figure 13-3.
5. Press Enter to end the line and start a new line.
Don’t let the ugly text format fool you at this point. The text beautifies
itself when you add the tab stops.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 for all the items in the tab-paragraph list.
When you’re done, you can set the tab stops. You need the ruler for this
next step:
7. Bid the Ruler appear, if need be.
Click the View Ruler button to show a hidden ruler.

Part III: Formatting 

8. Select all the lines of text you want to organize into a tab-tab-
paragraph list.
Chapter 7 discusses block-selection techniques.
9. Slide the Hanging Indent triangle to the 3-inch position on the ruler.
The paragraph appears.
10. Ensure that the left tab is chosen on the Tab gizmo.
The margin shows the Left Tab symbol.
11. Click the mouse to set a tab stop at 1.5 inches.
The second column snaps into place.
12. Adjust the tab stop and hanging indent triangle as necessary.
With the text still selected, you can slide the tab stop and the Hanging
Indent things on the Ruler to the left or right to adjust the look of your
tab-tab-paragraph. Whatever looks best works best.
You can vary these rules to have a tab-paragraph or even a tab-tab-tab-
paragraph. The more tabs you have, the tighter the paragraph gets, so be
careful. (The notes from the preceding section also apply to this technique.)
The Center Tab Stop
The center tab is a unique critter, and it has a special purpose: Text placed at
a center tab is centered on a line. Unlike centering a paragraph, only text
placed at the center tab stop is centered. This is ideal for centering some-
thing in a header or footer, which is about the only time you use this type of
tab stop.
Figure 13-4 shows an example of a center tab. The text on the left is at the
start of the paragraph, which is left-justified. But the text typed after the tab
is centered on the line.
Figure 13-4:
A center tab
in action.
173
Chapter 13: Setting Tabs

Here’s how to make that happen:
1. Start a new paragraph, one containing text that you want to center.
Center tabs are found in one-line paragraphs.
2. Set a center tab.
If necessary, show the ruler: Click the View Ruler button. Click the Tab
gizmo until a center tab appears, as shown in Figure 13-4. Click the
mouse on the light gray part of the Ruler to set the tab. In Figure 13-4,
the center tab is set at the center of the page, at the 3-inch position.
3. Optionally, type some text to start the line.
The text you type should be short; it appears only at the start of the line.
4. Press the Tab key.
The insertion pointer hops over to the center tab stop.
5. Type the text to center.
As you type, the text is centered on the line. Don’t type too much;
remember that the center tab is a single-line thing.
6. Press Enter to end the line of text.
Obviously, if you just want to center text on a line, centering the entire para-
graph is a better choice; see Chapter 12. Otherwise, this technique finds itself
used mostly in page headers and footers, which are covered in Chapter 15.
Look there for an additional example.
 The center tab stop allows you to center text in a line without having to
center the entire line.
 Center tabs are best used on a single line of text, usually by themselves.
There’s no reason to do them any other way.
The Right Tab Stop
Right tabs are possibly the most confusing tab stop, until you’ve seen one in
action. What they do is to allow you to right-justify text at a tab stop, allowing
a single line of text to contain both right- and left-justified text. You’ve proba-
bly seen examples of this all over, but not recognized what it was, so here are
Figures 13-5 and 13-6 for you to gawk at.
As with the other tabs, right tab stops work best on a single line of text.
The following two sections describe how to set up right tab stops as shown
in Figures 13-5 and 13-6. In both cases, note that it’s assumed that the Ruler is
visible on the screen. Click the View Ruler button to show the Ruler in Word.

Right stop, left stop list
To create a centered, two-column list with a right tab stop and a left tab stop,
as shown in Figure 13-5, obey these steps:
1. Start out on a blank line, the line you want to format.
2. Choose the right tab stop from the Tab gizmo.
Keep clicking the Tab gizmo with the mouse until the right tab stop
appears.
3. Click the mouse at the 3-inch position on the Ruler.
4. Choose the left tab stop from the Tab gizmo.
Click, click, click until you see the left tab stop.
5. Click the mouse at the 31⁄8-inch position on the Ruler.
Use Figure 13-5 as your guide. Don’t fret; you can change the tab stop
positions when you’re just about done.
6. Press the Tab key.
The insertion pointer hops over to the 3-inch stop, the right tab stop.
7. Type your text.
The text is right-justified at the right tab stop.
8. Press the Tab key.
9. Type your text.
The text is left-justified (normal).
10. Press Enter to end the line of text.
11. Repeat Steps 6 through 10 for each line in the list.
As long as you keep the text to one line, the list should look great, just like in
Figure 13-5.

Chapter 13: Setting Tabs

To make adjustments, select the list as a block (see Chapter 7) and use the
mouse to adjust the tab stops on the ruler. As you move the tab stops, a
dashed line extends down through your text, showing you where the text
lines up.
Tab, right stop list
The right tab stop can also be used in a list, as shown in Figure 13-6, commonly
found in dramatic programs but just as good for a variety of purposes.
Here’s how to concoct such a thing:
1. Start out with a blank line of text.
2. Ensure that the Tab gizmo on the Ruler shows the right tab stop.
Refer to Figure 13-6.
3. Click the mouse at the 4-inch position on the Ruler.
The position is just a guess at this point. Later, you can adjust the right
tab stop setting to whatever is more visually appealing.
4. Type the left column text.
The text is left-justified, like normal.
5. Press the Tab key.
The insertion pointer hops to the right tab stop.
6. Type the right column text.
The text you type is right-justified, pushing to the left as you type.
7. Press Enter to end the line of text.
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 for each line in the list.
Figure 13-6:
Right tab

176
Part III: Formatting 

Afterward, you can mark the text as a block and then use the mouse to drag
the right tab stop back and forth to whatever looks more visually appealing.
 You can drag the left indent toward the center of the page to offset the
list from the left margin.
 Also refer to the section “Setting leader tabs,” later in this chapter, for
adding a dotted leader to the right tab stop.
The Decimal Tab
The decimal tab lives to line up columns of numbers. Although you could use
a right tab to do this, the decimal tab is a better choice. Rather than right-
align text, as the right tab does (see the previous sections), the decimal tab
aligns numbers by their decimal portion — that period in the number, as
shown in Figure 13-7.
Here’s how to work with such a beast:
1. Start a blank line of text.
2. Choose the Decimal tab stop from the Tab gizmo on the Ruler.
Refer to Figure 13-7.
3. Set the tab stop on the ruler by clicking the mouse at the 3-inch position.
4. Type the left column text.
5. Press the Tab key.
6. Type the numerical amount.
The number is right-justified until you press the period key. After that,
the rest of the number is left-justified. The effect is that the amount is
lined up at the decimal tab stop by the period in the number.
7. End that line of text by pressing Enter.
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 for each line in the list.
Figure 13-7:
Lining up

decimal tab.
177
Chapter 13: Setting Tabs

When you type something without a period in it (refer to Figure 13-7), it’s
shown right-justified.
You can adjust your text by selecting all the lines as a block and then moving
the decimal tab stop on the Ruler with the mouse.
The Bar Tab
Aside from being a most excellent pun, the bar tab isn’t a true tab stop in
Word. Instead, consider it as a text decoration. Setting a bar tab merely
inserts a vertical line into a line of text, as shown in Figure 13-8. It’s much
better than using the | (pipe) character on the keyboard for drawing a verti-
cal line in your document.
The setup to create the three-column text shown in Figure 13-8 is similar
to what’s presented earlier in this chapter for a two-column list (see the earlier
section “The tabbed list”), although Figure 13-8 shows a three-column list
with the first column at the start of a line.
A bar tab is set like any other tab. But, rather than insert a tab, it inserts a
black vertical line in the text. The line appears always, even when no text
or tabs are used on a line, as you can see in the last row of text (empty) in
Figure 13-8.
In Figure 13-8, observe that a left tab stop is set immediately after the bar
tab to help organize text on a line. This is normally how bar tabs are used,
although for all practical purposes it’s just easier in Word to surrender here
and use the Table function instead; see Chapter 20.
The Tabs Dialog Box
If setting tabs on the Ruler is the left-brain approach, using the Tabs dialog
box is the right-brain method of setting tab stops in Word. The Tabs dialog
box, shown in Figure 13-9, allows you more precision over using the Ruler by
itself.
Figure 13-8:
The mysteri-
ous bar tab.
178
Part III: Formatting 

Getting to the Tabs dialog box is a journey, the type of journey that ends with
an “All I got was this stupid Tabs dialog box t-shirt.” The simplest way to
beckon forth the Tabs dialog box is to double-click the mouse in the middle
of the Ruler (on the light gray part). Of course, that also sets a tab stop,
which can be frustrating.
The other way to get to the Tabs dialog box is to summon the Paragraph
dialog box: do so by clicking the Dialog Box Launcher button in the lower-
right corner of the Paragraph group, on the Home tab. When the Paragraph
dialog box is visible, click the Tabs button in the lower-left corner to bring
forth the Tabs dialog box.
Setting a tab in the Tabs dialog box
When you need to be precise with your tab stops and the Ruler is proving
unruly, follow these steps to set your tabs in the Tab dialog box:
1. Enter the exact tab stop position in the Tab Stop Position box.
For example, type 1.1875 to set a tab at exactly that spot.
2. Choose the type of tab stop from the Alignment area.
The standard tab stop is Left. Other tab stops are covered elsewhere in
this chapter.
3. Click the Set button.
The Set button — not the OK button — is what creates the tab stop.
After you click Set, your tab stop is placed on the list below the Tab Stop
Position dialog box. (You may notice that numbers are rounded to the
nearest tenth; Word interprets 1.1875 as 1.9, for example.)
Figure 13-9:
The Tabs
dialog box.
179
Chapter 13: Setting Tabs

4. Continue setting tabs.
Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for as many tabs as you need to set.
5. Click OK.
The tabs you set affect the current paragraph or a selected group of para-
graphs. If the Ruler is visible, you can see the tabs and adjust them by using
the mouse.
 You must click the Set button to set a tab! I don’t know how many times
I click OK, thinking that the tab stop is set, and it’s not.
 For most of your tab-setting exercises, I recommend using the Ruler.
The Tab dialog box is only necessary when you need to be precise,
when you’re setting multiple tabs close to each other, or when you’re
defining leader tabs, as described next.
Setting leader tabs
There’s only one task that must be done in the Tabs dialog box that you
cannot do with the Ruler: Set a leader tab.
What is a leader tab?
A leader tab produces a row of dots, underlining (in a fashion) the tab charac-
ter. Three styles are available:
Fearless dot leader tabs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .180
Zipper line leader tabs  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _180
U-boat underline leader tabs
180
You can apply a leader tab to any tab stop in Word other than the bar tab.
To do so, refer to other sections in this chapter on how to set the various tab
stops — specifically, the right tab stops. To add the dot leader to the tabbed
list you’ve created, follow these steps:
1. Select the text as a block.
Refer to Chapter 7 for block-marking directions.
2. Bring forth the Tabs dialog box.
3. Select the tab stop from the Tab Stop Position list.
180
Part III: Formatting 

For example, in Figure 13-6, the right tab stop shows up in the Tab Stop
Position list as 4". Click to select that item in the list.
4. In the Leader area, choose the leader style.
None means “no leader,” and it’s selected already. Choose one of the
three other options.
5. Click the Set button.
Don’t click OK before you set the tab stop to add the leader. This step is
the one you’ll screw up most often.
6. Click OK.
After clicking the Set button, you can click OK to close the Tabs dialog
box and gawk at your text.
Leader tabs with the underline character are also the best way to create fill-
in-the-blanks forms. Use the Tabs dialog box to set a left tab stop at the far
left margin (usually, 6.0 inches). Choose an underline leader for that tab.
Click Set and then OK. Back in your document, type the prompt for the 
fill-in-the-blanks line, such as
Your name:
Rather than press a brazillian underlines, just press the Tab key. Instantly, a
line extends from the colon to the right margin.
Default tab stops
Word automatically sets tab stops for you in each new document you create.
These default tab stops are set at half-inch intervals. That’s fine for most
people, but you can change those defaults, if you like.
New default tab stops are set in the upper-right corner of the Tab dialog box
(refer to Figure 13-9), where a new interval for the default tab stops is entered.
For example, to set the default tab stops three-quarters of an inch apart,
type 0.75” in the Default Tab Stops box. Click the OK button to confirm and
close the Tabs dialog box. The default tab stops appear as dark brown ticks
(they’re very hard to see) on the gray line below the ruler.
When you set your own tab stops, Word removes the default tab stops
between the left margin and wherever any tab stop is set. For example, in
Figure 13-8, you can see the default half-inch tab stops starting at the 3-inch
position.
181
Chapter 13: Setting Tabs

Unsetting a Tab Stop
Removing a tab stop is as easy as dragging the Tab Stop icon from the Ruler:
Point and click at the tab stop and drag the mouse downward, and the tab
stop is gone.
The Tabs dialog box can also be used to remove tab stops. It’s especially
good for those times when you may have several tab stops close together
and plucking one out with the mouse would be tiresome. In the Tabs dialog
box, choose the tab stop position in the Tab Stop Position list, and then click
the Clear button. Poof! It’s gone!
Clicking the Clear All button in the Tabs dialog box removes all tabs from the
ruler in one drastic sweep.
To delete a Tab character, of course, simply back up over it with the
Backspace key.

N
ormally, Word doesn’t ask questions about the paper you’re using.
Nope. It’s not that Word doesn’t care. It cares! But rather than ask ques-
tions, Word just guesses that you’re using a typical, boring sheet of paper.
That’s fine, until you need something more interesting or set up a page differ-
ently than Word normally guesses. For that, you need to properly describe
the sheet of paper to Word. Thus, you have the dawn of page formatting.
Page formatting starts with a piece of paper, the final destination of your
word processing journey. It covers the margins, or air around the text you
write. And, just to be different, in this chapter at least, page formatting also
covers page numbering.
Describe That Sheet o’ Paper
No matter what size paper you’re printing on, Word refers to it as a page.
As you can possibly guess, not all pages are alike; even within a single docu-
ment, page size or orientation can change, so pages must be flexible in order
for them to be useful.

This section discusses the various ways Word deals with paper and pages.
A page is a sheet of paper about “this” big
Word can print on any size sheet of paper, from a wee postage stamp to the
same broadsheet a newspaper is printed on, or even larger. There are only
three things to keep in mind here:
 You must find that specific paper size, possibly at an office supply store.
 You must have a printer that can swallow that specific paper size.
 You must tell Word that you’re using that specific paper size.
The paper-size-setting stuff is done in the Page Setup group on the Page
Layout tab. Choosing a specific size of paper is done by clicking the Size
button in that group, which displays a menu, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Choose your paper size from that list.
For example, if you want to print on that tall, legal-size paper, choose Legal
8.5" x 14" from the list. Your entire document is then updated to reflect the
new page size.
Figure 14-1:
The Size
menu.
184
Part III: Formatting 

 To select a size not shown on the menu, choose the More Paper Sizes
command to summon the Paper tab of the Page Setup dialog box. Refer
to the section “Behold the Page Setup dialog box,” elsewhere in this
chapter, for more information.
 Page-size changes are reflected in the entire document, from first page to
last. That is, unless you divide your documents into sections. Then you
can use different page sizes within each section. Refer to Chapter 15 for
information on sections.
 Most PC printers can print on several sizes of paper. Weird sizes,
although available on the list, may not be compatible with your printer.
 A typical sheet of paper, at least in the United States, measures 81⁄2
inches across by 11 inches tall. Most of the rest of the world uses the
A4 paper-size standard, which is slightly longer and a tad narrower.
 If you’re printing on an odd-size piece of paper, remember to load that
special paper into your printer before you start printing. Some smarter
printers even tell you which paper size they want to print on. Mine nags
at me all the time for the proper paper size. It’s like a second mother.
Page orientation (landscape or portrait)
Word normally prints on a sheet of paper from top to bottom with the narrow
edge on top. This is called portrait mode because its orientation is vertical,
like a portrait.
Word can also be told to print longways, or in landscape mode. This trick is
done by choosing Landscape from the Orientation command in the Page
Layout tab’s Page Setup group, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Choosing Orientation➪Landscape directs Word to shift the paper orientation
for every page in your document. This doesn’t mean that the text is sideways
more than it means that the text prints wide on a page (though I suppose that
it could be looked at as printing sideways).
Figure 14-2:
Setting
a page’s
orientation.
185
Chapter 14: Formatting Pages

To change the pages back, choose Orientation➪Portrait.
 Changing between portrait and landscape modes may require you to
adjust the document’s margins; see the next section.
 Make the decision to have your document in landscape mode before you
do any extensive formatting. That mode affects your paragraphs and
other “lower-level” formatting, so you should have it done first, before
you start composing your text.
 Scientists and other people in white lab coats who study such things
have determined that human reading speed slows drastically when
people must scan a long line of text, which happens when you use land-
scape mode. Reserve landscape mode for printing lists, tables, and
items for which normal paper is too narrow.
 Consider using multiple columns in landscape mode. See Chapter 21.
 Also see the section “Behold the Page Setup dialog box,” later in this
chapter, for more page-orientation settings and options.
Marginal information
Every page has margins. They provide the air around your document — that
inch or so of breathing space that sets off the text from the rest of the page.
As with other things in Word, these margins can be adjusted, fooled, cajoled,
or otherwise obsessed with.
Word automatically sets your margins at 1 inch from the top and bottom of
the page and 1.25 inches from the left and right sides of the page. Most English
teachers and book editors want margins of this size because these people
love to scribble in margins. (They even write that way on blank paper.)
In Word, you can adjust the margins to suit any fussy professional.
To change the margins, use the Page Setup group on the Page Layout tab.
Clicking the Margins button in that group displays a menu full of common
margin options, as shown in Figure 14-3.
Specific margins can be set by clicking the Custom Margins button at the
bottom of the Margins menu. Doing so displays the Margins tab in the Page
Setup dialog box, where specific margin information can be entered, includ-
ing information on printing more than one page on a sheet of paper. Refer to
the next section for more information.
186
Part III: Formatting 

 Margins on a page are covered in this chapter. To set the indents for a
single paragraph, you need to use a paragraph-formatting command.
See Chapter 12.
 The stars on the Margin menu’s icons represent popular or recent
margin choices you’ve made.
 Keep in mind that most laser printers cannot print on the outside half-
inch of a piece of paper — top, bottom, left, and right. This space is an
absolute margin; although you can tell Word to set a margin of 0 inches
right and 0 inches left, text still does not print there. Instead, choose a
minimum of 0.5 inches for the left and right margins.
 Likewise, many ink printers have a taller top or bottom margin require-
ment. If you attempt to print outside that area, a dialog box appears,
informing you of your offense.
Behold the Page Setup dialog box
As with many things in Word, when you want more control over page format-
ting, you must surrender from the Ribbon interface and use an old-fashioned
dialog box. In this case, it’s the Page Setup dialog box, shown in Figure 14-4.
Figure 14-3:
Stuff on the
Margins
menu.
187
Chapter 14: Formatting Pages

To summon the Page Setup dialog box, click the Dialog Box Launcher in the
lower-right corner of the Page Setup group on the Page Layout tab. Or, you
can use the keyboard shortcut: Alt+P, P, S.
The Page Setup dialog box sports three tabs: Margins for setting margins,
Paper for selecting the paper size, and Layout for dealing with other page-
formatting issues.
Click the OK button to confirm your changes and close the Page Setup
dialog box.
 To print on three-hole paper, use the Margins tab in the Page Setup
dialog box to set the gutter margin to about half an inch. That moves the
entire margin “frame” over one half-inch from where the three holes are
punched. You can set the Gutter Position to Left option, unless the holes
are punched on the top of the page, in which case you set the Gutter
Position to Top option.
188
Part III: Formatting 
Dangerous treading in the Multiple Pages 
area of the Page Setup dialog box
Nestled on the Margins tab of the Page Setup
dialog box is the Pages area (refer to Figure
14-4). The Multiple Pages drop-down list tells
Word how to use the paper on which your doc-
ument is printed. Surprisingly, there’s more than
one way to print a document on a page. The fol-
lowing definitions help, as does the little pre-
view page at the bottom of the Page Setup
dialog box:
Normal means one page per sheet of paper. You
can’t get more normal than that.
Mirror Margins is used when your printer is
smart enough to print on both sides of a sheet
of paper. That way, every other page is flip-
flopped so that your margins always line up. For
example, the “gutter” may be on the left of one
page, but on the right for the page’s back side.
2 Pages per Sheet splits the paper right down the
center and forces Word to print two “pages” per
sheet of paper. Note that this option works best
when used in landscape mode.
Book Fold is Word’s attempt to create a multi-
ple-page booklet by printing the proper pages
on both sides of a sheet of paper. This option
works best if you have a printer capable of print-
ing on both sides of a sheet of paper. The Sheets
Per Booklet option that appears helps tell Word
how long your booklet is.
Despite these options, Word is a poor book-
binding program. If you’re into any type of pub-
lishing, consider getting a desktop publishing
program, such as Adobe InDesign or Microsoft
Publisher, which are far better equipped to deal
with such things.

 Changes made to a page’s format — paper size, orientation, and margins —
normally affect an entire document. By using the Apply To drop-down
list in the Page Setup dialog box, however, you can determine which 
portion of a document will be affected by the margin change. You have
three options:
• Whole Document changes the margins for your whole document,
from bonnet to boot.
• This Point Forward means that the new margins take place from
the toothpick cursor’s position onward.
• This Section means that the margins apply to only the current sec-
tion. (See Chapter 15 for more information on sections.)

Where to stick the page number?
Word not only can automatically number your pages, but it also lets you
place the page number just about anywhere on the page and in a variety of
fun and interesting formats.
Start your page numbering odyssey thus:
1. In the Insert tab’s Header & Footer area, click the Page Number com-
mand button.
A menu drops down, listing various page-numbering options. The first
three are locations: Top of Page, Bottom of Page, and Page Margins or
the sides of the page.
2. Choose where to place the page numbers.
I want my page numbers on the bottom of the page, so I regularly
choose the Bottom of Page option.
3. Pluck a page-numbering style from the scrolling list.
There are oodles of samples, so don’t cut yourself short by not scrolling
through the menu. You can even choose those famous page X of Y
formats.
In Print Layout view, you can see the page numbers. In Draft view, they
remain hidden. (Use Print Layout or Print Preview to see them.) Dutifully,
Word numbers each page in your document, starting with 1 for the first page,
up to however many pages long the thing grows.
Delete a page? Word renumbers for you.
Insert a page? Word renumbers for you.
As long as you insert the page number per the preceding steps, Word handles
everything.
 Headers and footers are parts of a page that you can format with all
sorts of interesting things, including your own page number style or
even page numbers on both the top and bottom of the page. Refer to
Chapter 15 for details.
 To change the page number format, simply choose a new one from the
Page Number menu.
190
Part III: Formatting 

Starting off with a different page number
You and I know that the first page of a document is really page 1, but Word
doesn’t care. It lets you start numbering your document at whatever page
number you want. If you want to start numbering Chapter 2 at page 47, you
can do so, if you follow these instructions:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. In the Header & Footer area, choose Page Number➪Format Page
Numbers.
The Page Number Format dialog box materializes, as shown in
Figure 14-5.
3. Click the Start At radio button and type the beginning page number in
the box.
4. Click OK to close the Page Number Format dialog box.
Word starts numbering your document at the specified page number. So, if
you enter 47 in Step 3, the first page of your document is now page 47, the
next page is 48, and so on.
When you want the page number to jump in the middle of your document,
say, from page 5 to page 16 or (more likely) from page iv to page 1, you need
to use sections to divide the document. You can start page numbering over
again, and at any number or in a new section. See Chapter 15 for more infor-
mation on sections.
Figure 14-5:

Chapter 14: Formatting Pages

Numbering with Roman numerals
When the urge hits you to regress a few centuries and use Roman numerals
to tally a document’s pages, Word is happy to oblige. Summon the Page
Number Format dialog box (refer to Figure 14-5) per Steps 1 and 2 in the pre-
ceding section. Simply choose the style you want from the Number Format
drop-down list.
Removing page numbers
To strip out page numbers you’ve inserted into your document, choose the
Remove Page Numbers command from the Page Number menu (in the Header
& Footer group on the Insert tab).
The Remove Page Numbers command rids your document of only those page
numbers you’ve inserted by using the Page Number menu. If you’ve manually
added a page number in a header or footer, you must manually delete it. See
Chapter 15.
New Pages from Nowhere
As you type your document, Word keeps adding new, blank pages for you to
write on. These pages are appended to the end of the document, so even if
you’re typing in the midst of some chapter, the extra pages keep appearing so
that no text is lost and nothing falls off the edge. That’s all normal and good.
For those times when you need to stick a blank page in the middle of a docu-
ment, Word provides two interesting commands. This section explains things.
Starting afresh on a new, blank page
To start typing on a new page in your document, you need to insert a manual
page break, also called a hard page break. The simplest way to do this is to
press the Ctrl+Enter key combination. Word then begins a new page On That
Very Spot. All text before the insertion pointer is on the previous page, and
all text afterward is on a new page.
You can also insert a hard page break by choosing the Page Break command
from the Pages group on the Insert tab.
192
Part III: Formatting 

In Print Layout view, a hard page break looks like any other page break.
The only way to know the difference is to switch to Draft view and use the
Show/Hide command. In Draft view, the words Page Break appear before the
break in your document. That’s your clue that you have a hard page break.
Keep these points in mind when you’re dealing with hard page breaks:
 Never, never, never start a new page by pressing the Enter key over and
over until a new page pops up. That’s just leads to trouble later as you
edit your document.
 Pressing Ctrl+Enter inserts a hard page-break character in your document.
That character stays there, always creating a hard page break no matter
how much you edit the text on previous pages.
 You can delete a hard page break by pressing the Backspace or Delete
key. If you do this accidentally, just press Ctrl+Enter again or press
Ctrl+Z to undelete.
 If you set hard page breaks, remember to use Print Preview to look at
your document before you print it. Sometimes, the process of editing
moves text around, making the hard page breaks unnecessary and awk-
ward. Refer to Chapter 10 for more information on the Print Preview
command.
 The keyboard shortcut for the Show/Hide command is Ctrl+Shift+8.
You can also use the Show/Hide command button in the Home tab’s
Paragraph group.
 You can also insert a hard page break by choosing Breaks➪Page from
the Page Setup group. Remember that this command is on the Page
Layout tab, not on the Insert tab.
 Don’t fall into the trap of using hard page breaks to adjust your page
numbering. You can use the power of the computer to alter your page
numbers without having to mess with page formatting. See the section
“Where to stick the page number?” earlier in this chapter.
Inserting a whole, blank page
To shove a fresh, blank sheet of paper into the middle of a document, you can
use the Blank Page command button, found in the Insert tab’s Pages group.
What that command does is to insert two hard page breaks into a document,
which creates a blank sheet of paper.
193
Chapter 14: Formatting Pages

I don’t recommend using this command unless you really need a blank page
in the midst of a document. That is, you never plan on writing on that page.
Putting graphics on the page is fine. Adding a table, or any other one-page
element to the blank page is also fine. But because the blank page is inserted
by using two hard page breaks, writing on the page leads to formatting woes
down the line.
Remember that Word automatically adds new pages as you write. So don’t
use the Blank Page command unless you truly want a blank page in your 
document.
Page Froufrou
Page formatting happens above your text, below your text, to the sides of
your text, and even behind your text. This section demonstrates the things
you can format on a page that appear behind your words.
Color your page
To color your document’s pages, use the Page Color command button from
the Page Layout tab’s Page Background group. Clicking that button displays
a menu full of colors, some based on the document theme and some based
on standard colors, or you can choose your own color by choosing the
More Colors menu command. Gradients, or multiple colors, can be chosen
by using the Fill Effects menu command.
194
Part III: Formatting 
Protecting the widows and orphans
Occasionally, a paragraph of text may be split
between two pages in an awkward way. A
single line from a paragraph on the bottom of
one page is an orphan. A single line from a para-
graph ending at the top of a page is a widow.
Word offers orphan and widow protection,
which you can apply to paragraphs of text to
prevent that lone line from appearing at the top
or bottom of a page. The feature is Widow/
Orphan control.
Normally, Widow/Orphan control is turned on.
But you can disable it and set other options for
keeping paragraphs of text on one page or
another. This magic is done in the Paragraph
dialog box, on the Line and Page Breaks tab:
Press Alt+H, P, G to summon the Paragraph
dialog box, and then click the Page Breaks tab.
The options you set there are applied to the cur-
rent paragraph, or to any selected paragraph.
Click OK when you finish making your settings.

As you move the mouse over the various colors on the Page Color menu,
your document’s page color is updated to reflect that new color. The text
color may change as well (for example, from black to white) to remain visible.
The color you choose is produced by your printer, but you must direct the
printer to print the page color by following these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+P to summon the Print dialog box.
2. Click the Options button in the lower-left corner of the Print dialog box.
The Word Options window appears, with the Display item chosen on
the left.
3. In the Printing Options area, put a check mark by the item labeled
Print Background Colors and Images.
4. Click OK.
You can now print the background color.
Note that the color doesn’t cover the entire printed page. That’s because
your printer cannot mechanically access the outside edge of a page, so a
white (or whatever color the paper is) border appears around your colored
page. At this point, you need to ask yourself whether it’s just easier to use
colored paper rather than expensive printer ink or toner.
 To remove page coloring, choose the No Color command from the
Page Color menu.
 See Chapter 11 for information on coloring text.
The distinguished watermark
When finer papers are held up to the light, they show a watermark, an image
embedded into the paper. The image is impressive but faint. Word lets you
fake a watermark by inserting faint text or graphics behind every page in
your document. Here’s how:
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
2. In the Page Background group, click the Watermark button.
A menu plops down with a host of predefined watermarks that you can
safely duck behind the text on your document’s pages.
3. Choose a watermark from the long, long list.
The watermark is applied to every page in your document.
195
Chapter 14: Formatting Pages

Sadly, there are few options for customizing the watermark. You can choose
the More Watermarks command from the Watermark menu, which displays the
Printed Watermark dialog box. In there, you can choose between a picture
or text watermark. The picture item is handy because you can choose any
graphical image available on your PC (such as a company logo) to use as a
watermark. The text item, however, lets you only choose only predefined bits
of text.
To rid your document’s pages of the watermark, choose the Remove
Watermark command from the Watermark menu.
If the watermark doesn’t show up in the printed document, you may need to
enable the Print Background Text and Images setting. Refer to the steps in
the preceding section.

D
ocument is an impressive, important-sounding word. It’s also easier than
saying “that thing I made in my word processor.” In a way, document is
almost too serious to use for describing everything you write. It just seems
pretentious to say that this week’s kids’ chore chart, a grocery list, or the
random bawdy limerick ranks up there with documents like the Declaration
of Independence or Martin Luther’s 95 Theses.
As far as formatting is concerned, formatting a document is something you’ll
probably do only for those few big or formal documents you create. Real
documents. This includes the concept of sections, which are very useful yet
confusing to many beginners, as well as the more rational topic of headers
and footers.
The Oft Misunderstood Yet Useful
Concept of Sections
Most of the Word page-formatting commands affect every page in a docu-
ment: The settings for margins, page orientation, paper size, and other types
of formatting apply themselves not to a single page but rather to every dang
doodle page, from 1 to N, where N is the mathematical value best expressed
as “I don’t know how huge this value could be.”

But sometimes you need a document that isn’t formatted the same way page
after page. For example, you may want to number Pages 1 through 4 in
Roman numerals and then start over on Page 5 with Page 1 in human numer-
als. Or, you may want the first page of a document to be blank. Or, you may
need to display a table on Page 14 in landscape orientation. All those tricks
are possible if you understand the concept of sections.
Understanding sections
A section is a part of a document that contains its own page formatting.
You can direct page-formatting commands to affect only a section rather
than span an entire document. With each section separate from the others,
a document can have multiple page formats.
For example, in Figure 15-1, the document that’s illustrated contains two sec-
tions. The first is four pages long and uses Roman numeral page numbers.
The second section starts on Page 5, where the page number format is
restored to normal but starting at page number 1.
The document illustrated in Figure 15-2 has four sections. The first is the
cover page, followed by a regular document format. Section 3, however, con-
tains one page in landscape format. That’s followed by Section 4, which is
back to normal.

Part III: Formatting 

Obviously, when your document’s page formatting is the same from head to
tail, there’s no need to fuss with sections. For anything else, sections are truly
a blessing.
 A section is basically an area in your document whose page formatting is
different from or unique to the rest of your document.
 Text and paragraph formatting, as well as any styles you may create,
don’t give a hoot about sections.
Creating a section
Breaking up your document isn’t hard to do. Word has wisely placed all its
breaking commands on the Breaks menu: Click the Page Layout tab, and then
click the Breaks command button, found in the Page Setup group. The menu
is shown in Figure 15-3. Page-breaking commands are at the top of the menu;
section breaks are at the bottom.
Figure 15-3:
Ways of
breaking
your text or
a whole
document.
199
Chapter 15: Formatting Documents

The simplest way to create a new section is to choose Next Page from the
Breaks menu. This creates a page break, by starting a new page as a new 
section in your document.
In Print Layout view, the section break appears just like any other page break.
To determine whether a page break is a real page break or something else,
you must switch to Draft view and use the Show/Hide command: click the
Show/Hide command button on the Home tab or press Ctrl+Shift+8.
In Draft view, the section break appears with the text Section Break
(Next Page) in the middle of a double row of dots.
After the section is created, you can then modify the page layout and format
for each of the sections, as covered next.
 Use the Continuous section break to mix formatting styles within a page.
For example, if you have columns of text sharing a page with regular
text, the Continuous section break is the ideal way to separate the indi-
vidual formats. See Chapter 21 for more information on columns.
 You can use the Even Page and Odd Page options to start the next sec-
tion on the next even or odd page — ideal for those futile times when
you try to use Word to bind a book or pamphlet.
 Column and Text Wrapping breaks have nothing to do with sections.
Text Wrapping breaks work like soft returns (see Chapter 2), except that
they’re designed to be used on text that wraps around a figure or table.
See Chapter 21 for information on a Column break.
Using a section
To apply a specific page format to one section only, use the dialog box associ-
ated with the format, such as the Page Setup dialog box. In the dialog box,
look for the Apply To drop-down list. To apply the format to the current sec-
tion, choose This Section. That way, the format controls only the pages in the
current section.
To determine which section you’re in, right-click the status bar (at the
bottom of Word’s window). A pop-up Status Bar Configuration menu appears.
Near the top, you see the item named Section, and on the right, you see the
current section number. To see that information always displayed on the
status bar, choose Section from the menu; otherwise, press the Esc key to
make the pop-up menu go away.
200
Part III: Formatting 

Deleting a section break
You can delete a section break with the Delete key: Position the insertion
pointer just before the section break, and then press the Delete key. This
technique works best in Draft view with the Show/Hide command working to
display the section breaks.
 The Show/Hide command’s keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+8.
 Deleting a section removes any formatting, including headers and 
footers, that were unique to that section.
 If you accidentally delete a section break, you lose any special format-
ting you applied to the section. In this case, press the Undo shortcut,
Ctrl+Z, before you do anything else.
Adding a Cover Page 
(Sneaky and Quick)
I’d guess that the most popular use of section breaks is to thwack down a
title or cover page to a document. Typically, you don’t want page numbers or
header or footer information on the title page, so making that page its own
section is ideal. But conniving Word to create a single page section and then
fussing with headers and footers isn’t anyone’s idea of a fun time. Therefore,
Word 2007 has introduced the Cover Page menu. Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. In the Pages group, click the Cover Page button.
A fat, fun menu full of various cover-page layouts appears.
3. Choose a cover-page layout that titillates you.
That cover page is immediately inserted as the first page in your docu-
ment. Then Word displays it on the screen for further editing.
4. Select the bracketed text on the cover page.
5. Type the required replacement text.
For example, click [Enter Document Title]. Then type your docu-
ment’s real title. The text you type replaces the bracketed text.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until the cover page looks the way you like it.
201
Chapter 15: Formatting Documents

You can change a cover page at any time by choosing a new one from the
Cover Page menu, although I recommend removing the old one first: To remove
a cover page you’ve inserted, choose the Remove Current Cover Page com-
mand from the Cover Page menu. It helps to have the insertion pointer on the
cover page to delete it.
 The Cover Page menu doesn’t create a new section in your document.
If you’re using headers and footers, they appear on the inserted cover
page. To avoid this, position the insertion pointer at the top of Page 2
(after the cover page), and from the Page Layout tab, choose Break➪
Continuous. You can then modify the header and footer as described
elsewhere in this chapter.
 As you learn more about Word, you can even modify or add elements to
the cover page after it’s inserted. Refer to Chapter 23 for more informa-
tion about Word’s drawing commands.
 Leaving the bracketed text on your title page is tacky. Your boss doesn’t
want to see a report that has [Company Name] on it rather than your
company’s real name.
Hats and Shoes for Your Pages 
(Headers and Footers)
Documents can have headers and headings, footers and footnotes. It’s easy to
confuse things — until you read these handy bullets and peruse this section.
 A header is text that appears at the top of every page. It’s contained in a
special, roped-off part of the page where you can place special text.
 A heading is a text style used to break up a long document, to introduce
new concepts and help keep the text organized. See Chapter 16 for more
information on headings.
 A footer is text that appears at the bottom of every page. Like the header,
it has its own special area and contains special text.
 A footnote is a tiny bit of text that appears at the bottom of a page, usu-
ally a reference for some bit of text on that page. See Chapter 22.
 Headers and footers contain elements such as your name, the document
name, date, page number, title, and phone numbers. (“Hurry! Buy now!
Operators are standing by!”)
 Headers can also be called eyebrows. Weird, huh?
 Footers can include page numbers, a chapter or document title, and soft,
cushiony insoles.
202
Part III: Formatting 

The following sections refer to headers, but the information applies to footers
as well. (It’s just that I get tired of typing “header or footer” over and over).
Generally speaking, replace “header” with “footer” and it all works the same.
Adding a header
You can use a header. You can use a footer. You can use them both. You can
use neither. Either way, the technique is the same:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. From the Header & Footer group, choose the Header button.
A list of preformatted headers is displayed.
3. Choose the format you want from the list.
The header is added to your document, saved as part of the page format.
If you were in Draft view, you’re immediately switched to Print Layout
view so that you can edit the header. (Headers and footers do not appear
in Draft view.)
Notice the new tab on the screen? When you’re editing a header, the
Design tab appears. Refer to the following section for details.
4. Select any bracketed text.
Select the brackets too!
5. Type the required replacement text.
For example, replace [Enter Document Title] with the real title of
your document.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for all bracketed text in the header.
7. When you’re done, click the Close Header and Footer command button
in the Close group on the far right side of the Ribbon.
In Print Layout view, you can see the header or footer displayed in ghostly
gray text. In Draft view, you can’t see any header or footer, even though it’s
still there. (You can also use the Print Preview command, as covered in
Chapter 10, to see the header or footer.)
 You can also exit from editing a header by double-clicking the mouse in
the main part of your document
 You don’t have to go to Page 1 to insert a page number in the header.
Word is smart enough to put the proper number on the proper page no
matter where you’re editing the header in your document.
203
Chapter 15: Formatting Documents

 Headers and footers are geared to sections in your document. Therefore,
as long as you’re in the same (or only) section, you can edit the header
or footer for that section.
 The Header and Footer command buttons are found on the Insert tab,
not on the Page Layout tab.
Editing a header
Face it: Word’s preset designs for the header are dull. Splashy, but dull. And,
chances are that they don’t contain all the information you want or need.
That’s no problem. You can edit the header using what Word created as a
starting point, or you can just quickly whip up your own header. It’s easy.
Here’s how:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. In the Header & Footer group, choose Header➪Edit Header.
When you edit the header, Word tosses you into a special mode of opera-
tion. The header appears on the screen as part of the page in Print Layout
view. Plus, a new tab appears with groups customized for creating and
editing headers, as shown in Figure 15-4.
3. Use the Go to Header or Go to Footer command button to switch
between the header and footer for editing.
4. Edit or modify the header.
Items in the header are edited just like anything else in Word. You can
add or edit text and format that text by using any of Word’s text- and
paragraph-formatting commands, including tabs. (See Chapters 11, 12,
and 13.)
You can modify any graphics in the header, although I recommend that
you review Chapter 23 before doing so.
Figure 15-4:
Tools for
editing a
header or
footer.
204
Part III: Formatting 

Word preformats headers with center and right tabs at the center and
far right side of the page. This allows you to press the Tab key and type
some text to have the text automatically centered at the bottom (or top)
of the header or footer.
5. Use the command buttons on the Design tab’s Insert group for special
items.
Here are some of the more useful special items you can insert into a
header. The inserted items appear wherever the insertion pointer is
located:
• Page number: Choose Quick Parts➪Page Numbers and choose a
page number format from the list. The page number text then
appears in the header. If you want to center the page number,
press the Tab key and then insert the page number.
• Date & Time: Clicking the Date & Time button displays a Date and
Time dialog box, which lists various date, time, and combination
formats. Choose one, and then click the OK button to insert that
date or time text into the header.
• Graphics: Use the Picture button to browse for graphics images
on your PC’s hard drive, which you can insert into the header.
The Clip Art button can also be used. Be sure to brush up on
graphics in Word by reading Chapter 23 before you try this.
• Fields: The most versatile thing you can insert into a header or
footer is a field; choose Quick Parts➪Field from the Insert group.
Fields, however, require extra explanation. Refer to Chapter 18 for
the details.
6. Click the Close Header and Footer command button when you’re done.
You’re back in your document.
The header is the same for every page in your document. Word is happy to
oblige, however, whenever you want a different header, such as for the first
page or alternating pages or for different sections in a document. The last few
sections in this chapter explain the details.
 The Design tab (refer to Figure 15-4) may look subtly different on your
computer monitor, depending on the screen’s resolution.
 In Print Layout view, you can quickly edit any header or footer by
double-clicking its ghostly gray image.
 If all you need a header for is just a page number, I highly recommend
using the page-numbering tricks covered in Chapter 14 as an easier alter-
native to working with headers directly.
205
Chapter 15: Formatting Documents

Making odd and even headers
This book is formatted with odd and even headers: The header on the odd
(left) pages contains the page number and then the part number and title.
On the (right) even pages, the header shows the chapter number, title, and
then the page number. You can pull off such a trick in your document as well.
To force Word to accept odd and even headers, obey these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. From the Header & Footer group, choose Header➪Edit Header.
The Header & Footer Tools Design tab is displayed on the screen
(refer to Figure 15-4).
3. Click to put a check in the box by Different Odd & Even Pages, found
in the Options group.
This step tells Word that you want two sets of headers: one for odd
pages and one for even pages. Notice how the tag identifying the
header changes:
The tag tells you which header you’re editing; in this case, it’s the
Odd Page header.
4. Create the header for the odd pages.
Refer to the preceding section for notes on making a header or footer.
Remember that the footer can contain any formatted text you would 
otherwise stick into a Word document.
5. Click the Next Section button.
Word displays the even page’s header, allowing you to create or edit its
contents. The Header tag changes to reflect which header you’re editing:
By the way, you click the Next Section button to go from the odd header to
the even header. You must click the Previous Section button to return
to the odd header from the even header.
206
Part III: Formatting 

6. Click the Go To Footer button to edit the footer’s odd and even pages.
Edit the footer’s contents and click the Next Section button to ensure
that you work on both the odd and even footers (as you do in Steps 4
and 5 for the header).
7. Click the Close Header and Footer button when you’re done.
Removing the odd/even header option is as simple as unchecking the Different
Odd & Even Pages option in the Options group (the opposite of Step 3).
When you do that, the even page header and footer are deleted, leaving
only the odd header and footer.
“But I don’t want a header 
on my first page!”
Most people don’t want the header or footer on the first page, which is usually
the title page or a cover page. Suppressing the header for that page is easy.
Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. From the Header & Footer group, choose Header➪Edit Header.
3. In the Options group, select Different First Page.
You see the Header tag change to First Page header, and the Footer tag
change likewise. That’s your visual clue that the first page of the docu-
ment sports a different header from the one in the rest of the document.
You can still edit the First Page header, if you like. It’s merely different, not
necessarily empty.
Headers and document sections
Just as Superman is limited in his powers by the crippling force of kryptonite,
the mighty header is limited in its scope and power by the limiting force of
the document section. A header, or footer, can exist within only one section.
Creating a new section creates a new set of headers and footers.
Word flags each set of headers and footers in the tag just below or above the
header or footer area, such as:
207
Chapter 15: Formatting Documents

That helps you determine which section’s header or footer you’re editing.
To switch to the next section’s header, click the Next Section button.
To switch to the previous section’s header, click the Previous Section button.
A source of frustration with multiple sections exists when you use the Link to
Previous option. What this option does is set one section’s header to match
the previous section. That way, you can keep the same header in multiple
sections. For example, sometimes you merely want to change page orienta-
tion in the middle of a document, but you don’t need to change the header.
At other times, the Link to Previous button may be source of frustration
because it causes any changes made in one section to be either replaced in
another section or ignored.
As a hint, when you have the Link to Previous option enabled, the header is
tagged on the left with the following:
That’s a big clue to why you may be unable to edit a header, when such a
thing causes you frustration.
 A header is a section-long thing. By placing multiple sections in your
document, you can have multiple headers. Refer to the first part of this
chapter for information on sections.
 Multiple sections allow you to change headers throughout a document
or to suppress the header on a single page and then pick it up again
after that page.
 To suppress the header on the first page of a document, follow the
instructions in this chapter’s earlier section “But I don’t want a header
on my first page!”
 Changing a header in one section doesn’t affect any other section in the
document — unless you’re using the Link to Previous option.
 When you have the Different First Page option checked (as you do in the
earlier section “But I don’t want a header on my first page!”), note that
each section has its own first-page header and footer, which are different
from (and separate to) the other headers in that section.
 The Different Odd & Even Pages option affects all sections of a 
document.
208
Part III: Formatting 

Removing a header
The simplest way to remove a document header is to use the Header➪
Remove Header command. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Go to the page where the header exists.
Use Print Layout view for this step so that you can see the ghostly image
of the header at the top of the page.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. From the Header & Footer group, choose Header➪Remove Header.
The header is gone.
This trick removes only the header for the current section. To remove 
headers in other sections, you must repeat these steps.
To remove a footer, choose Footer➪Remove Footer in Step 3.
Another way to remove a header is to delete all the text in a header: Press
Ctrl+A to select all the text in the header, and then press the Delete key. Poof!
The header is gone.
I recommend removing the header on any pages in your document that
change orientation. That’s because the header prints on the “wrong” edge of
the page, which is inconsistent with the rest of the document. Because the
page (or pages) with a different orientation is in its own section anyway,
simply delete the header for that section. Then the reoriented pages can 
continue with headers and footers for the rest of the document.

ocument formatting can be a snack or a banquet. You can choose not
to format anything, or you can format your document to distraction.
Formatting can become an obsession, often more important than what the
document has to say in the first place!
Microsoft has seen the light, and the happy minions who design Word have
created a formatting gift for you: styles. A style is a preset format, something
you can quickly slap down on your text to present your words in the best
way possible. This chapter discusses the details and timesaving abilities of
Word’s styles.
The Big Style Overview
Styles are a traditional ingredient of the word processing stew, designed to
save you formatting toil. As word processors grew in power and computer
printers were capable of fancier fonts, it grew tedious to continue applying
the same formats to text over and over.

For example, every time your document needed a heading, you had to apply
the same font, size, bold, paragraph-spacing, and other attributes again and
again. That was a pain — especially given how computers are supposed to
excel at doing repetitive things.
By combining various text and paragraph formats into a style, Word saves
you time and effort. To format your text, simply apply the style. And, if you
change your mind, you can instantly update all the text formatted with the
same style. Such is the beauty — and power — of the style.
 A style is nothing more than a collection of Word’s formatting com-
mands all stuffed into a single container.
 All text in Word has a style. As configured, Word uses the Normal style to
format your text. Unless you specify otherwise, Word uses the Normal
style — typically, the Calibri font, 11 points, left-aligned paragraphs, line
spacing at 1.15, and no indenting.
 Word doesn’t demand that you use styles. They do, however, make for-
matting your documents easier.
Types of styles
Word sports five different types of styles:
 Paragraph: The paragraph style contains any formatting: paragraphs,
indents, tabs, font, text size, attributes — you name it. The paragraph
style can format all the standard paragraph or character formats, part
of both, or just one aspect of either.
 Character: The character style formats only characters, not paragraphs.
Anything mentioned in Chapter 11 can be stuffed into a character style.
 Linked: The linked style is a combination style that can be applied to
both paragraphs and individual characters. The difference depends on
which text is selected when you apply the style.
 Table: The table style is applied to tables, to add lines and shading to
the table cells’ contents. Refer to Chapter 20 for more information on
tables in Word.
 List: The list style is customized for presenting lists of information.
The styles can include bullets, numbers, indentation, and other formats
typical for the parts of a document that present lists of information.
Character styles allow you to uniformly apply attributes to your text.
The Emphasis Quick Style, for example, typically formats characters in italic.
The Strong Quick Style formats text in bold. By using these styles, you can
212
Part III: Formatting 

universally change all text formatting in that style within your document.
So, if you decide that Emphasis isn’t only bold but also red-colored text, you
can make the change once and it’s reflected throughout your document.
Styles quick and custom
Word comes with a slew of styles created by professional designers, styles
that are ready to use in any document. These are known as the Quick Styles.
When you tire of the Quick Styles, or when you need more than what they
offer, you can create your own styles. That way, you can go beyond what’s
offered with the Quick Styles or simply do your own designing.
Making your own style isn’t that tough; later sections in this chapter show
you the ropes.
Using a style
Applying a style to your text works just like formatting. The major difference
is that rather than a single format being applied, the style slaps down multi-
ple formats on your text.
The most popular way to apply a style is to select the text you want to change.
Choose the style (as explained in the next section) after selecting the text,
and that style is applied to the selected text.
You can also choose a new style and then just start typing; the new style
affects the new text you type.
Paragraph styles can be applied by either selecting the entire paragraph
(or more than one paragraph) or simply putting the insertion pointer into
a paragraph and then applying the style.
 The current style is highlighted in the Home tab’s Styles group, although
that group doesn’t list all styles. The Styles task pane and the Apply
Styles task pane do a better job of describing the style that’s in use. See
the sections “Employing the Styles task pane” and “Discovering which
style you’re using,” later in this chapter, for more information.
 When you select part of a paragraph, a character or combination style is
applied to only the selected text. A paragraph style, however, is applied
to the entire paragraph — never mind that only part of the paragraph is
selected.

Chapter 16: The Styles of Word

Effortless Formatting Fun 
with Quick Styles
Using Quick Styles helps you avoid the sitting, stewing, and fussing that are
required when you must create your own styles. Word blesses you with a
vast assortment of Quick Styles to use and choose for formatting your text.
This section mulls over the possibilities and potentials.
When you use Quick Styles, you don’t have to bother yourself with any text
or paragraph formatting. Simply choose the Quick Style, and the text size,
font, attributes, and paragraph formatting are chosen for you automatically.
Applying a Quick Style to your text
You can apply a Quick Style to your text before or after you write, although
I recommend writing first and applying style later.
The easiest way to apply a Quick Styles style is to use the Quick Styles
gallery, found in the Home tab’s Styles group (see Figure 16-1). Use the
arrows to scroll through the gallery’s styles, or use the More button to 
display the menu detailing each option.
The following steps demonstrate how to apply a style to text you’ve already
written:
1. Select the text you want to format.
2. Choose a style from the Quick Styles gallery.
You can scroll through the list to find the style you want, or drop down
the menu to see a smattering of styles.
As you hover the mouse over each Quick Style, text in your document is
updated to reflect the style’s appearance — a boon to help you make
that difficult choice.
Each style has a name that helps describe how best to use it, and those names
are important! Table 16-1 lists some common Quick Styles names and how
Figure 16-1:
The Home
tab’s Styles
group.
214

best to put them to use. (Many more styles are available than can fit in the
table; only some of the more common or useful styles are listed as examples.)

Chapter 16: The Styles of Word

 The heading styles are special. Your document can be organized with
Heading 1 main headings, Heading 2 subheadings under Heading 1
styles, and down the line through Heading 3 and Heading 4, and so on.
When you use the heading styles this way, you not only help keep your
document organized, but also take advantage of other Word features as
noted throughout this book.
 Heading 1 is similar to the A-level heading found in other word proces-
sors and desktop publishing programs. Heading 2 is the B-level heading,
and so on.
 Headings should be only one line long.
 You can break up headings: Press Shift+Enter to create a soft return in
the middle of a long heading.
 When you’re done typing a heading formatted with Heading 1 or Heading 2
or some other heading level, press the Enter key. Automatically, the fol-
lowing paragraph is formatted using the Normal style. Normal is the
“follow me” style used for all the heading styles. Refer to the sidebar
“The follow-me style,” later in this chapter, to find out how that works.
 The Title style isn’t a heading style.
 Normal is the name of the style that Word applies to all text unless
another style is chosen.
 There’s an advantage to using character styles such as Emphasis and
Strong instead of formatting your text as italic or bold. Refer to the sec-
tion “Switching to another style set,” later in this chapter, for one reason
why you might want to use those Quick Styles rather than manually
format your text.
 Quick Styles work with only Word 2007 documents. To use Quick Styles
with an older Word document, you must convert the document’s format.
Refer to Chapter 25 for information on how to do that.
Employing the Styles task pane
The Quick Styles gallery, shown on the Ribbon, shows only the last several
styles you’ve used. Often, that’s not enough! Like wee little Oliver, you want
some more! Happily, more styles — lots more — can be found in the Styles
task pane, shown in Figure 16-2.
To display the Styles task pane, click the Dialog Box Launcher in the lower-
right corner of the Styles group on the Home tab. The keyboard shortcut is
Alt+Ctrl+Shift+S.
216
Part III: Formatting 

The Styles task pain, er, pane works just like the Styles group on the Ribbon:
To select a style, choose it from the list. Unlike with the Ribbon, however, text
in your document doesn’t change as you point your mouse at the various
styles; you must click the mouse on a style to see it applied to your text.
Dismiss the Styles task pane by clicking the X (close) button in the upper-right
corner of its window.
Here are some other things to note about the Styles task pane:
 Choosing the Show Preview option displays the styles in their given 
formats.
 The Styles task pane lists only “recommended” styles. To see the whole
slew of styles available in Word, click the Options link in the lower-right
corner. In the Styles Gallery Options dialog box, use the Select Styles to
Show drop-down list to choose the item labeled All Styles. Click OK, and
the Styles task pane is updated to list every dang doodle style available
in Word.
 When you idle the mouse pointer over a style, a technical description
appears in a pop-up bubble. Gross!
 Pointing the mouse at a style reveals its menu button to the right of the
style’s name. Options on that menu help you control the style. The last
option on the menu lets you add or remove the style from the Quick
Style gallery on the Ribbon.
Figure 16-2:
The Styles
task pane.
217
Chapter 16: The Styles of Word

The Styles task pane lite
If the Styles task pane seems a bit unwieldy, especially on a small monitor, you
can use the Apply Styles task pane as an alternative, as shown in Figure 16-3.
Regardless of whatever text is selected, or whichever text the insertion
pointer is blinking inside, that format is reflected inside the Apply Styles task
pane, on the Style Name list. You can also reformat text by choosing a new
style from that list.
To conjure up the Apply Styles task pane, click the More arrow in the Quick
Style gallery and choose the Apply Styles command. The keyboard shortcut
is Ctrl+Shift+S.
Discovering which style you’re using
It’s often difficult to discover which style is applied to your text. Sometimes,
the style is highlighted in the Quick Styles gallery. The Home tab’s Font group
displays the text (Heading) or (Body) when you’ve selected Heading- or
Normal-formatted text. But that’s just not good enough.
To determine which styles you’re using, summon the Style Inspector by click-
ing the Style Inspector button at the bottom of the Styles task pane (shown in
the margin). The Style Inspector dialog box appears, shown in Figure 16-4.
It’s quite the informative thing.
Figure 16-4:
The Style
Inspector.
Figure 16-3:
The Apply
Styles
task pane.
218
Part III: Formatting 

Close the Style Inspector task pane by clicking the X in its upper-right corner.
To really see the details of how your text is formatted, click the Reveal
Formatting button in the Style Inspector. Clicking that button summons the
gruesome Reveal Formatting task pane, which shows the specifics of which
formats are applied to any text. It’s quite the display! Click the X button in the
task pane’s upper-right corner to hide the thing at once!
The keyboard shortcut for the Reveal Formatting command is Shift+F1.
Switching to another style set
One of the reasons you would want to use the Emphasis style rather than
apply italics directly to your text is that Word comes with a bunch of style sets.
You can universally change the look of your document by simply choosing a
new style set.
To select a new style set, from the Home tab’s Styles group, click the Change
Styles button. From the menu that’s displayed, choose Style Set, and then move
the mouse over the various menu items. As each menu item is highlighted,
your document’s formatting is updated with new styles (if you used Quick
Styles to format your document). Choose a style you find pleasing.
 The Default style set is the one you probably used originally, unless you
specifically chose a style set to use.
 Also refer to the topic of document themes, which is covered in
Chapter 17.
Unapplying a style
Choosing a new style for your text replaces the old style. Changing paragraph
styles doesn’t change any character styles. All that makes sense as you play
with it, but sometimes what you really want to do is rid yourself of styles
entirely. To do that, you need a style scrubber, strong as any household bath-
room cleanser. In Word, that’s the Clear Formatting command.
To peel away stubborn style stains, select the text you want to cleanse and
choose the Clear Formatting command button from the Font group on the
Home tab. Whatever text you have selected is stripped of formatting by that
command.
 The keyboard shortcut for the Clear Formatting command is Ctrl+
spacebar. When you think about it, the spacebar produces the “clear”
character, so that makes sense — at least more sense than the alterna-
tive keyboard shortcut, Alt+H, E.
219
Chapter 16: The Styles of Word

 The Style Inspector is a great place to remove specific formatting from
text without affecting other formatting. Refer to the earlier section
“Discovering which style you’re using” for information; use the Clear
Formatting buttons in the Style Inspector to selectively peel off formatting.
 The Clear Formatting command removes all text formatting, whether it
was applied with a Quick Style or a style you created yourself or was
manually applied.
 Because formatting cannot be utterly removed, what the Clear Formatting
command really does is to reapply the Normal style to the selected text.
Do-It-Yourself Styles
Despite the fact that the good folks at Swanson Foods offer a variety of inter-
esting and delicious frozen dinner selections, some people are still foolish
enough to cook their own meals. That’s because no matter the variety, no
matter the brilliance, some people know what they want and prefer to do
things themselves. The same holds true with styles in Word, although with-
out any nutritional value whatsoever.
You can use your formatting prowess in Word to create your own custom
styles, which you can then apply to your text as you see fit, saving you valu-
able formatting time. This section describes how it’s all done.
Creating a style based on text 
you’ve already formatted
The easiest way to make up a new style is to use all your formatting skills and
power to format a single paragraph just the way you like. Then create the
style based on that formatted paragraph. Here’s how:
1. Type and format a paragraph of text.
Keep all text formats (font, size, attributes) the same inside the block.
Paragraph formatting uses only one text format for the whole paragraph.
2. Mark your paragraph as a block.
See Chapter 7 to find out how to mark a block of text.
3. Press Alt+Ctrl+Shift+S to summon the Styles task pane.
The task pane may already show your paragraph style, but not as a
named style; the highlighted item in the Styles dialog box reflects the
formatting you’ve directly applied to your text. Your next job is to give
that formatting a style name.
220
Part III: Formatting 

4. Click the New Style button.
Look in the lower-left corner for this button.
The Create New Style from Formatting dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 16-5. It’s the place where new styles are born.
5. In the Name box, type a name for your style.
As usual, short and descriptive names work best. Also, try not to use the
name of an existing style or else you replace that style with the new one.
6. Ensure that Paragraph is chosen from the Style Type drop-down list.
The drop-down list is where you change the style type, as described
elsewhere in this chapter.
7. Make any further adjustments to the style as necessary.
The whole dialog box is geared toward creating styles. There are some
command buttons for quick changes, but note the Format button in the
lower-left corner of the dialog box. Clicking that button displays a pop-up
list of formatting dialog boxes. Select one to further customize aspects
of your style.
8. Put a check mark by the item labeled Add to Quick Style List if you
want your style to appear in that list.
9. Click the OK button to create your style.
The style is added to Word’s repertoire of styles for your document.
Figure 16-5:
The Create
New Style
from
Formatting
dialog box.
221
Chapter 16: The Styles of Word

The style you created now applies to the paragraph you typed (on which the
style is based), and you can apply the style to other paragraphs.
And now, the shortcut!
The fastest way to create a new paragraph style based on text you’ve typed
and formatted is to follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding steps and then,
from the Quick Styles gallery menu, choose the command Save Selection As
New Quick Style. Doing so displays a tiny dialog box in which you merely
have to type the name of your style. Click the OK button and you’re done.
Cinchy.
Now, even though there’s a quick way to create a style, you may still find
yourself using the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box (refer to
Figure 16-5), so don’t go around telling people that you were ripped off by
marching through all those steps.
 The styles you create are available only to the document in which
they’re created.
 If you create scads of styles that you love and you want to use them for
several documents, you need to create a template. Chapter 17 covers
this procedure, in the section about making a new template from scratch.
 You may have to tweak some things in your style. If so, you need to use
the Style and Formatting task pane. See the section “Modifying a style,”
later in this chapter.
222
Part III: Formatting 
The follow-me style
When I write a new chapter in a book, I start off
with my own Chapter Title style. The next style I
use is my Intro Paragraph style. Intro Paragraph
is followed by TextBody, which is followed by
TextBody, TextBody, TextBody, and on and on.
There’s no point in my having to apply those
styles because I can tell Word to switch styles
automatically.
In the Create New Style from Formatting dialog
box (refer to Figure 16-5), locate the Style for
Following Paragraph drop-down list. The style
shown on that list tells Word which style to switch
to when you press the Enter key to end a para-
graph. Normally, it’s the same style, which makes
sense for most of your work. But in situations
where you know that the style will switch, you
can demand that Word do the switching for you.
You can edit the Chapter Title style so that the Intro
Paragraph style is selected from the Style for
Following Paragraph drop-down list. That way,
pressing the Enter key after typing the chapter title
switches the style to Intro Paragraph. Very nice.

 A quick way to create a style is to base it on another, existing style. Choose
that existing style from the Style Based On drop-down list in the Create
New Style from Formatting dialog box (refer to Figure 16-5). Use the dialog
box to subtly modify the style, but be sure to give the style a new name.
 When you create one style based on another, any changes to the first
style are reflected in all styles based on that style.
 You can use the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box to whip up
a style from scratch: Just summon the dialog box and use its controls to
whip out a new style based on the formatting options you choose.
Creating character, list, and 
other types of styles
The Create New Style from Formatting dialog box (refer to Figure 16-5) allows
you to create any one of Word’s five style types. The key is to choose the type
from the Style Type drop-down list. When you do, the contents of the dialog
box change to reflect whatever options are available for that style type.
For example, when you choose Character from the Style Type drop-down list,
only character-formatting commands and settings are available in the Create
New Style from Formatting dialog box.
 See the “Types of styles” section, earlier in this chapter, for more infor-
mation on Word’s five different style types.
 Character styles don’t affect paragraph formatting. Selecting a character
style changes only the font, style, size, underlining, bold, and so on.
 Also refer to the section in Chapter 18 about stealing this format, for a
quick method of applying font formats.
Modifying a style
Styles change. Those wedgie shoes that were sworn off in the early 1980s
seem to have made a surprising comeback. Maybe there’s hope for bell-
bottoms again?
Just as fashion styles change, you may need to change styles in your document.
There’s nothing wrong with that. In fact, by changing a style, you demon-
strate the power of Word: Changing a style once causes all text formatted
with that style to be updated with the change in your document. That beats
the (bell-bottom) pants off making that change manually.
223
Chapter 16: The Styles of Word

To modify a style, heed these steps:
1. Summon the Styles task pane.
Click the Dialog Box Launcher in the lower-right corner of the Styles
group (on the Home tab), or press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S.
2. Point the mouse at the style you want to change.
A menu button appears on the right end of the style’s entry.
3. Click the menu button to display the style’s menu.
4. Choose Modify.
A Modify Style dialog box appears, although it’s really the same Create
New Style from Formatting dialog box (refer to Figure 16-5) you’ve used
before. This time, however, the settings you make now change the style
rather than create a new style.
5. Change the formatting for your style.
You’re free to use any of the formatting options to change your style.
You can even add new formatting options or a shortcut key (which is
covered in the next section).
6. Click OK when you’re done.
Close the task pane if you’re done with it.
Giving your style a shortcut key
Style shortcut keys make formatting even better because pressing Alt+Shift+T
to get at the TextBody style is often faster than messing with the Quick Styles
gallery or the various task panes.
To give your style a shortcut key, follow these steps:
1. Work through Steps 1 through 4 from the previous section.
Your goal is to display the Modify Style dialog box for your soon-to-be
shortcut-key-blessed style.
2. Display the style’s menu thing (refer to Figure 16-3).
3. Click the Format button.
It dwells in the lower-left corner of the dialog box.
4. Choose Shortcut Key from the menu.
A cryptic Customize Keyboard dialog box appears.
5. Press your shortcut key combination.
224
Part III: Formatting 

Notice that the key combination you press appears as text in the Press
New Shortcut Key box. (See the middle right side of the dialog box.)
If you make a mistake, press the Backspace key to erase it and choose
another key combination.
6. Check to see whether the combination is already in use.
For example, Word uses Ctrl+B as the Bold character-formatting short-
cut key. This key combination appears under the heading Currently
Assigned To, which shows up under the Current Keys box. Keep an eye
on that box! If something else in Word uses the shortcut key, press the
Backspace key and go back to Step 5.
When the key combination you press isn’t used by anything, you see
[unassigned] displayed under the Currently Assigned To heading.
That’s your signal that it’s okay to use that keystroke.
7. Click the Assign button.
8. Click the Close button.
The Customize Keyboard dialog box skulks away.
9. Click the OK button.
You can also close the Style task pane, if you’re done with it.
Congratulations; you now have a usable shortcut key for your style. Try it
out: Position the toothpick cursor in a block of text and press the key. Ta-da!
It should apply the formatting without messing with any of the other format-
ting or task pane widgets discussed elsewhere in this chapter.
Deleting a style
You can delete any style you create. It’s easy: Display the Styles task pane
(press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S), select the style, and choose Delete from its menu.
You’re asked whether you’re sure that you want to delete the style. Choose
Yes to delete it for real.
You cannot delete the Normal, Heading, or any other standard Word style.
Managing All Your Various Styles
Styles can be like trading cards. And they should be! If you create a great style,
it’s nice to use it in several documents. You can do this without re-creating
the style (and even without using a document template, which is covered in
Chapter 17).
225
Chapter 16: The Styles of Word

To trade or manage all the styles you have in Word, you need to use the Style
Organizer. It’s not the easiest thing to find:
1. Summon the Styles task pane.
2. Click the Manage Styles button at the bottom of the task pane.
The Manage Styles dialog box appears, but it’s not your final destination.
3. Click the Import/Export button.
Finally. The Organizer dialog box appears, with the Styles tab forward,
as shown in Figure 16-6.
The purpose of the Organizer is to manage styles (and other things, but this
chapter talks about styles). You can do that by moving styles between vari-
ous documents and document templates in Word.
For example, on the left side of Figure 16-6, you see the styles available in the
document: YOU DON.DOCX. On the right are the styles that appear in the
NORMAL.DOTM document template. (NORMAL.DOTM is a file that contains
all the standard Word settings.)
Choose from either side of the dialog box the style you want to copy. After
selecting the style, click the Copy button to copy it to the other side.
That’s how you swap and share styles between documents and templates.
To choose another document or template, click the Close File button. That
button changes to the Open File button, which you can then use to open any
Word document or template stored on disk. After the document is open, a list
of styles in that document is displayed in the window.
Click the Close button when you’re done managing the styles.

ord sports some formatting commands and techniques that allow you
to craft or build an entire document in one swift stroke, like a magi-
cian making an elephant appear, but without all that money spent on Purina
Elephant Chow. The tools that make such magic possible are themes and
templates.
With a mere click of the mouse, you can employ the power of themes to
quickly format your document in a most professional manner. With a few
skillful keystrokes, you can turn a template into a formatted, finished master-
piece. This chapter shows you how you can use these simple tools to fool
everyone into thinking that you’re a Word processing genius.
Formatting Fast and Fancy with a Theme
Themes are used to apply certain decorative styles to your document, giving
it a professionally formatted look and appeal. It’s like hiring an interior deco-
rator named Fránz but not having to struggle with his heavily accented
English.

A theme consists of three elements:
Colors: A set of colors is chosen to format the text foreground and back-
ground, any graphics or design elements in the theme, plus hyperlinks.
Fonts: Two fonts are chosen as part of the theme — one for the heading
styles and a second for the body text.
Graphical effects: These effects are applied to any graphics or design ele-
ments in your document. The effects can include 3D, shading, gradation,
drop-shadows, and other design subtleties.
Each of these elements is organized into a theme, given a name, and placed
on the Themes menu for easy application in your document.
Refer to the next section for information on applying a theme.
 A theme’s fonts, colors, and design effects are created by a professionally
licensed graphics designer so that they look good and work well together.
 The graphical effects of a theme are only applied to any graphics in
your document; the theme doesn’t insert graphics into your text.
See Chapter 23 for information on graphics in Word.
 You can use the various Themes menu commands to search for even
more themes.
 Choosing a theme affects your entire document all at once. To affect
individual paragraphs or bits of text, apply a style or format manually.
Refer to Chapter 16.
 A theme doesn’t overrule styles chosen for a document. Instead, it
accents those styles. The theme may add color information, choose 
different fonts, or present various graphical elements. Beyond that,
it doesn’t change any styles applied to the text.
 Themes work only with Word 2007 documents. To apply a theme to
an older Word document, you must convert the document’s format.
Refer to Chapter 25 for more on converting old Word documents.
Applying a document theme
Choosing a theme is done from the Page Layout tab, in the Themes group.
Built-in themes are listed on the Themes button’s menu along with any custom
themes you’ve created yourself. Figure 17-1 illustrates the Themes menu.
 Each of the built-in themes controls all three of the major theme ele-
ments, changing your document’s contents accordingly.
 Pointing the mouse at a theme previews your document, by showing
how it would look if you went ahead and applied that theme.
228
Part III: Formatting 

 Click to select a theme.
 Because a document can use only one theme at a time, choosing a new
theme replaces the current theme.
 To remove a theme from your document, choose the Office theme 
or the menu command Reset to Theme from Template (refer to
Figure 17-1).
 If you would rather change only one part of a theme, such as a docu-
ment’s fonts, use the Theme Colors, Theme Fonts, or Theme Effects
command button in the Themes group.
Modifying or creating a theme
You can’t really create your own themes from scratch, but you can modify
existing themes to make your own, custom theme. To do so, use the Theme
Colors, Theme Fonts, or Theme Effects button to select the fonts, colors, or
effects you want for your theme. Mix and match. Pick and choose.
Figure 17-1:

menu.
229
Chapter 17: Themes and Templates

When you have things the way you like, click the Themes button and choose
the Save Current Theme command. Use the Save Current Theme dialog box
to give your theme a proper descriptive name and save it to disk. That theme
you create then appears in the Custom area of the Themes menu (refer to
Figure 17-1).
The selections offered in Word’s themes are fairly rich. Still, it’s possible to
create custom colors or fonts for use in themes. To do so, use the Theme
Colors or Theme Fonts button:
To create a custom color theme, choose Theme Colors➪Create New Theme
Colors. Use the Create New Theme Colors dialog box to pick and choose
which colors apply to text or various graphical elements in your document.
To create a custom font theme, choose Theme Fonts➪Create New
Theme Fonts. Use the Create New Theme Fonts dialog box to select
your fonts — one for the headings and another for the body text.
In each case, give the new theme a name and save it to disk. You can then
choose that theme from the Custom area of either the Theme Colors or
Theme Fonts menu.
 To remove a custom theme, right-click it on the Themes menu and
choose the Delete command.
 You can remove a custom theme color or theme font by right-clicking
the Theme Color or Theme Font in the Custom area of the menu. Choose

the Delete button. Click the Yes button when you’re prompted to remove

Whipping Out Similar Documents 
Based on a Template
A template is a pattern you follow to create something. Had you asked a com-
puter user from the 1980s about templates, he would have thought about
something that was placed over a computer keyboard, a stiff piece of card-
board to help locate keyboard shortcuts used in various programs. Even early
For Dummies books back in the 1990s came with such keyboard templates as
a “free” bonus (a $2.99 “value”).
In Word, template refers to a skeleton document you can build upon to create
a final document. Templates are really quite handy to have and use, as this
section demonstrates.
230
Part III: Formatting 

What is a template?
Templates are special types of Word documents. They can contain styles, 
formatting, perhaps a header or footer, plus even some text. They’re created
just like documents but are saved to disk in a unique way. That’s because you
never really use the template itself, but rather a copy. By using that copy,
you can create an entirely new document; the template merely helps you
get started by doing some of the routine things for you.
Document templates help to save time and prevent you from having to
repeat your efforts. I use one template for sending faxes, one for writing 
letters, one for writing plays, and so on. This book has its own Dummies
template that contains all the text styles the publisher’s production 
department uses to produce the book. Whenever I need to start a new 
chapter, I use the Dummies template so that the paragraph, heading,
caption, and other styles match what my publisher uses, which keeps
them happy. I hope.
It’s worth your time to create a template for all the common document types
you use regularly. The following sections describe how.
 Just as all text in Word sports a specific style (see Chapter 16), all 
documents in Word are based upon a template, whether you choose
a template to start with or not.
 In Word, all documents are based on the Normal document template,
NORMAL.DOTM. Refer to the section “Understanding NORMAL.DOTM,”
at the end of this chapter, for more information.
 Information on using templates is in Chapter 9.
 There are three filename extensions for document templates in Word:
DOT was the template filename extension used for older versions of
Word. With Word 2007, DOTX and DOTM are used. DOTX refers to a tem-
plate that doesn’t employ macros; the DOTM indicates a template that
uses macros. (This book does not cover macros.)
Creating a template based on a 
document you already have
Building the pyramids was hard. Building your own document template is
comparatively easy. In fact, it’s probably easier than what you’re doing already,
which is most likely re-creating the same document and the same formats
over and over and over again. That’s tedious, even without 100,000 slaves.
And, if there’s one thing computers are good at, it’s reducing tedium.
231
Chapter 17: Themes and Templates

To create a template, follow these steps:
1. Find a common document, one that has styles or formats or text you
plan on using again and again.
When you’re using an existing document, save it to disk one last time,
just to be sure. Next, strip out all the text that you don’t want in the tem-
plate; keep the text that you plan on using over and over. Delete all the
graphics that you don’t want in the template; keep the graphics that you
need to use again and again. Edit the header and footer so that they con-
tain only the items you repeatedly need every time you create a similar
document.
Figure 17-2 shows a sample template I created, complete with some text
and graphics. Remember that the template needs to contain only the
styles you need for that document, plus any text that is common to all
documents. In Figure 17-2, only the text that stays the same is included;
other text is added when the user opens the template, to help him
create a new document.

2. Choose the Save As command from the Office Button menu.
The Save As dialog box appears. It’s the same Save As dialog box
that Word uses for saving anything. Refer to Chapter 9 if you need a
refresher.
3. Type a name for the template.
The name goes into the File Name box. Be descriptive.
You don’t need to name the template using the word template.
4. From the Save As Type drop-down list, choose Word Template
(*.dotx).
Ah-ha! This is the secret. The document must be saved as a document
template. Choosing that item directs Word to save the document as
a template in Word’s special Templates folder. Word does all that work
for you, but you must choose Word Template as the file type.
5. Click the Save button.
Your efforts are saved to disk as a document template, nestled in the
proper place where Word keeps all its document templates.
6. Close the template.
Choose the Close command from the Office Button menu, just as you
would close any other document in Word.
The reason for closing it is that any changes you make from now on are
made to the template. If you want to use the template to start a new 
document, you need to choose that template from the New Document
window as described in Chapter 9.
Refer to the later section “Modifying a template you created” for information
on updating or changing a template.
 Yes, it helps to be well-versed with Word’s formatting and style com-
mands if you attempt to create a template from scratch. Even then, you
most likely have to go back and “fix” things.
 Remember the purpose of a template: to store styles and often-used
information in a single place.
 You can give a template any name, although if you choose the name of a
template that already exists, Word warns you. This is standard file-
saving stuff; just choose another name and be on your merry way.
233
Chapter 17: Themes and Templates

Making a new template from scratch
The first thing I do before I begin some projects is to start a new template for
the project. It’s only a guess, of course, but it’s enough to get me started and
save me time for each new document I create. Here’s what to do:
1. From the Office Button menu, choose the New command.
The New Document window appears.
2. Double-click the item labeled Blank Template.
A fresh, new document appears on the screen, although it’s not a docu-
ment! Check the title bar. It’s a template!
3. Build the template by adding needed text, formatting, and other stuff.
When you’re creating a new template, simply put into the document all
the styles you plan on using, plus common text. For example, my Book
template (for when I stop writing computer books and start writing
“real” books) contains all the styles I need for writing books plus the
word Chapter at the start of each page. That’s because each document is
a chapter, and starting it with the text Chapter already in the template
saves me valuable typing energy molecules.
4. Save the template by choosing the Save As command from the Office
Button menu.
5. Use the Save As dialog box to give the template a proper, descrip-
tive name.
Note that the Save As dialog box chooses a special Templates folder in
which to place your document templates. Use that folder!
6. Click the Save button.
And the template is saved.
Refer to Chapter 9 for information on using the new template.
Modifying a template you created
Changing or editing a document template is identical to changing or editing
any document. You simply create a new document by using the existing 
template. Make your changes, and then use the Save As command to either
overwrite the existing template or save the document as a new template, per
Steps 4 through 6 in the preceding section.
Yes, there are other ways to edit a document template. You can actually open
the template itself in Word, but the steps involved are rather convoluted.
234
Part III: Formatting 

It’s just much better to start off with the template like you’re creating a new
document and then simply save that document back to disk as a template.
You’re updating a template, not just a single document on disk. Any style
changes you make to a document template affect all the documents already
created with that template.
Attaching a template to a document
Documents have templates like people have last names. Mostly, the docu-
ments are born with their templates. You either choose the template when
the document is first created (see Chapter 9) or just create a new document,
in which case the NORMAL.DOTM template is used. You can change that by
assigning or attaching a new template to a document. Here’s how:
1. Open the document that needs a new template attached.
2. From the Office Button menu, choose the Word Options command.
3. Choose Add-Ins from the left side of the Word Options dialog box.
4. On the right side of the window, near the bottom, choose Templates
from the Manage drop-down list.
5. Click the Go button.
The Templates and Add-ins dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-3.
You should see which template is currently attached to the document,
such as Normal, as shown in the figure. Whatever template name
appears there is whichever template is attached to the document.
Figure 17-3:
The
Templates
and Add-ins
dialog box.
235
Chapter 17: Themes and Templates

6. Click the Attach button.
Word displays the Attach Template dialog box, which looks and works
like the Open dialog box. Normally, this dialog box opens in the Templates
folder, where you’ve probably stored a host of templates available for
the plucking.
7. Select the template you want to attach.
8. Click the Open button.
The template is now attached, but you may need to do one more thing
back in the Templates and Add-ins dialog box (refer to Figure 17-3).
9. Optionally, select Automatically Update Document Styles.
Updating the styles means that your document’s current styles are
changed to reflect those of the new template, which is probably what
you want. If not, skip this step.
10. Click OK.
The styles (and toolbars and macros) stored in that template are now
available to your document, and the document is now attached to the
template.
Note that attaching a template doesn’t merge any text or graphics stored in
that template. Only the styles (and toolbar and macros) are merged into your
document.
You can also use these steps to unattach a template. Do that by selecting
NORMAL.DOTM as the template to attach.
 The template that’s attached to a document may be just a name (refer to
Figure 17-3) or a pathname indicating the location and name of a template
document on disk.
 Any time you change or update a template, the changes are reflected in
any document created by or attached to that template.
Understanding NORMAL.DOTM
The Normal template is a special beast. Referred to by its filename, NORMAL.
DOTM, the Normal template is where Word stores all the settings made for
any new document you create with the Ctrl+N shortcut or by choosing Blank
Document from the New Document window (see Chapter 9).
236
Part III: Formatting 

Knowing about NORMAL.DOTM is important because you can change the
Normal template, if you want.
For example, if you want to change the standard font and size (and whatever
other formatting) Word uses when it opens a new document, simply make
those changes to NORMAL.DOTM. Change the font and margins for the
Normal style. Then save NORMAL.DOTM back to disk.
Now, just after saying that, let me warn against modifying NORMAL.DOTM
too much. It’s a good idea to keep NORMAL.DOTM as a baseline standard, so
rather than modify it too much, consider creating another template instead.
 Refer to the section “Modifying a template you created,” earlier in
this chapter, for more information on how to find and change
NORMAL.DOTM.
 Another reason to change NORMAL.DOTM may be if someone else got
there first and made a modification you don’t like. In that case, you need
to edit NORMAL.DOTM to remove the change.
 If you just want to change the default font, refer to Chapter 11, the 
section about fun and formatting in the Font dialog box. Use the Font
dialog box to Set Text options as you want them in the Normal template,
and then click the Default button to make the change. The same can be
done with the Paragraph dialog box (refer to Chapter 12) and its Default
button.

Misc. Formatting Stuff
In This Chapter
 Formatting magic
 Creating automatic lists and borders
 Understanding fields
 Inserting document information
 Centering a title page
 Swiping text formats
T
he stuff in the previous several chapters describes specific things you can
do to inject some life into a dreary, unformatted document. Before leav-
ing this formatting part of the book, however, I’d like to toss in an et cetera
chapter. You’ll find the information on the following pages chockfull of for-
matting goodness, including a plethora of formatting tricks and tidbits that
just quite couldn’t fit elsewhere in this part of the book. Welcome to the Word
formatting buffet dessert bar!
Automatic Formatting
Word sports a feature called AutoFormat that does for formatting what
AutoCorrect does for typing. Where AutoCorrect instantly retypes your
spelling boo-boos (see Chapter 8), AutoFormat instantly fixes common 
formatting faux pas. This section demonstrates AutoFormat’s prowess.
 AutoFormat must be activated for it to work. Refer to the inaptly named
section “Disabling the @#$%&! AutoFormat,” later in this chapter, if
you’re having trouble working with any of the AutoFormat features.
 Likewise, AutoFormat tends to annoy people. Refer to the aptly named
section “Disabling the @#$%&! AutoFormat” for directions on turning the
booger off.

Enjoying automagical text
AutoFormat controls some of the minor text formatting you type. The best
way to demonstrate this concept is to have a Word document up on the
screen and then type the examples in the following sections. Note that these
are only a few of the things AutoFormat can do.
Smart quotes
The quote characters on the keyboard are tick marks: “ and ‘. AutoFormat
converts them into more stylish open and closed curly quotes. Type hither:
She said, “Take off my dress! And don’t you ever let
me catch you wearing my clothes again!”
Both the single and double quotes are properly used and converted.
Real fractions
You can format a fraction by typing the first value in superscript, and then
the slash, and then the second value in subscript. Or, you can let AutoFormat
do it for you. Here’s an example:
I spend twice the time doing 1⁄2 the work.
The 1/2 is converted into the single character 1⁄2. This trick works for some,
but not all, common fractions. When it doesn’t work, use the superscript/
subscript trick described in Chapter 32, in the section about building your
own fractions.
Hyperlinks
Word can underline and activate hyperlinks typed in your document, such as
I’ve been to www.hell.com and back.
Now, I don’t like this trick and prefer not to have hyperlinks in a document.
Visit the section “Disabling the @#$%&! AutoFormat,” later in this chapter, if
you agree.
Ordinals
You’re guessing wrong if you think that ordinals are a baseball team or a
group of religious leaders. They’re numbers with st, nd, or rd after them, as
this line demonstrates:
I came in 1st and Blake came in 3rd.
240
Part III: Formatting 

Word automatically superscripts the ordinals, making them look oh-so-spiffy.
Em dashes
An em dash is the official typesetting term for a long dash, longer than the
hyphen (or its evil twin, the en dash). Most people type two hyphens to emu-
late the em dash. Word fixes that:
Bart’s first stage appearance was a triumph --
except for the zipper incident.
As you type the -- (dash-dash), AutoFormat replaces it with the official em
dash character.
 The keyboard shortcut for typing an em dash is Ctrl+Alt+minus, where
minus is the minus key on the numeric keypad.
 The keyboard shortcut for typing an en dash is Ctrl+minus.
 Don’t type Ctrl+Alt+hyphen, where the hyphen key is on the typewriter
keyboard. That changes the mouse pointer to a heavy black bar and acti-
vates a secret destructive mode in Word. Quickly press the Esc key to
cancel.
Paragraph formatting tricks
At the paragraph level, AutoFormat helps you quickly handle some otherwise
troublesome formatting issues. Some folks like this, some don’t. The follow-
ing sections provide a few examples of what AutoFormat is capable of.
If you find any of these AutoFormat tricks annoying, refer to the later section
“Disabling the @#$%&! AutoFormat” for information on shutting the dumb
thing off!
Numbered lists
Any time you start a paragraph with a number, Word assumes (through
AutoFormat) that you need all your paragraphs numbered. Here’s the proof:
Things to do today:
1. Buy new freezer for the cat.
Immediately after typing the 1., you probably saw the infamous AutoFormat
lightning bolt icon and noticed your text being reformatted. Darn, this thing is
quick! That’s AutoFormat guessing that you’re about to type a list. Go ahead and
finish typing the line; after you press Enter, you see the next line begin with 2.
241
Chapter 18: Misc. Formatting Stuff

Keep typing until your list ends or you get angry, whichever comes first.
To end the list, press the Enter key again. That erases the final number and
restores the paragraph formatting to Normal.
 This trick also works for letters (and Roman numerals). Just start some-
thing with a letter and a period, and Word picks up at the next line with
the next letter in the alphabet and another period.
 Bulleted lists can also be created this way: Start a line by typing * and a
space to see what happens.
 See Chapter 22 for more information on creating numbered or bulleted
lists.
 I know that I say earlier in this book not to press the Enter key twice to
end a paragraph. That still holds true: When you press Enter twice to end
an AutoFormat list, Word sticks only one Enter “character” into the text.
Borders (lines)
A line above or below a paragraph in Word is a border. Most folks call them
lines, but they’re borders. Here’s how to whip out a few borders by using
AutoFormat:
---
Typing three hyphens and pressing the Enter key causes Word to instantly
transmute the three little hyphens into a solid line that touches the left and
right paragraph margins.
 To create a double line, type three equal signs and press Enter.
 To create a bold line, type three underlines and press Enter.
 Refer to Chapter 19 for more information on borders and boxes around
your text.
Undoing an AutoFormat
There are two quick ways to undo AutoFormatting. The first, obviously, is to
press Ctrl+Z on the keyboard, to give the Undo command. That’s easy.
You can also use the lightning bolt icon to undo an AutoFormat. Clicking the
icon displays a drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 18-1. Three options are
usually available: Undo what’s been done, disable what’s been done so that it
doesn’t happen again, and, the final option, display the AutoFormat dialog
box, which is covered in the next section. Choose wisely.
242
Part III: Formatting 

Disabling the @#$%&! AutoFormat
Formatting is subjective. Sometimes you want AutoFormat to help you
out, and sometimes it makes you angry enough to hurl the computer into
a lake. Either way, AutoFormat is controlled by a special dialog box buried
deep within Word’s bosom. Here’s the treacherous trail that leads to that
location:
1. Choose the Word Options command from the Office Button menu.
The Word Options window steps front and center.
2. Select Proofing from the left side of the window.
3. Click the button labeled AutoCorrect Options.
4. Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab in the AutoCorrect dialog box.
This part of the dialog box, shown in Figure 18-2, is where all the
AutoFormat options dwell. Turning an option off or on is as easy as
removing or adding a check mark.
5. Set the options as you like.
I don’t mind some of the options, but I detest the Apply As You Type
options, so I unchecked them all.
6. Click the AutoFormat tab.
Gadzooks! More options.
7. Set the options on the AutoFormat tab.
Repeat your choices here; I don’t know why some of the things are listed
twice in the dialog box. Silly Microsoft.
8. Click OK to confirm your choices, and close the Word Options
window.

Become an Expert in Your Fields
The text you write in Word is as everlasting as text forged by electrons can
be. You’re the only one who can change your text by editing it. Or, I should
say, only humans can change the text because on the 19th day, when God
was angry over just having created lawyers and mortgage brokers, God cre-
ated copy editors. But I digress. . . .
There’s such a thing as changing text in Word. By using a nifty device called
a field, you can insert a special chunk of text into your document, text that
changes to reflect information about your document: the current page,
today’s date, your name, and other changing stuff.
Inserting a field into your document
To take advantage of fields, you use the Field dialog box, shown in Figure 18-3.
To display this dialog box, click the Insert tab and then choose Quick Parts➪
Field from the Text group.
The left side of the Field dialog box contains scrolling lists of categories and
then field names. The right side of the dialog box changes to let you further
select options, based on what type of field you’re messing with.

As an example, choose Author from the list of field names. In the Field

matted, such as Title case. Click the OK button to insert the field into your
document. Lo and behold, that should stick your name into the document.
Hello, author!

Chapter 18: Misc. Formatting Stuff
Those mystery tag-like things
When Word creates a header or footer for you
or you insert a page number, you see that spe-
cial content formatted differently from a field. It
looks something like this:
That’s a content control, a special type of field
that contains dynamic information pertaining to
a document. The content controls are usually
inserted by Word commands, such as those that
automatically create headers or footers or insert
page numbers. You can also use the Quick Parts➪
Properties command (found in the Insert tab’s
Text group) to insert a property control.
You can edit a content control’s contents if you
like, and some controls are designed that way.
But editing the text in other controls changes
the thing to plain text, so be careful.
Time-sensitive content controls can be updated
by pressing the F9 key.
Some Date content controls have a pick-the-
date button, displaying a tiny calendar from
which you can set the property’s date.
To automatically insert a Date content control
into your document, press Alt+Shift+D. To insert
a Time content control, press Alt+Shift+T.

Though fields look like regular text, they’re not. For example, when you press
Backspace to erase a field, the entire field becomes highlighted. That’s your
clue that you’re about to erase a field, not regular text. Press Backspace again
to erase the field (and its text).
 You cannot edit text in a field. You can only delete it: Do so by selecting
the entire field as a block and then pressing the Delete key.
 To adjust a field, right-click the field and choose Edit Field from the 
pop-up menu. The Field dialog box is redisplayed, allowing you to
make modifications to the field.
 Some field’s contents can change. To ensure that the field is up-to-date,
right-click it and choose the Update Field command. For example, a date
field is updated to the current date when you choose the Update Field
command.
 You can display the field’s true, ugly self. Just as those mutants at the
end of Beneath the Planet of the Apes removed their human masks, you
can remove a field’s mask by right-clicking it and choosing the Toggle
Field Codes command. Repeat those steps to put the mask back on. Whew!
Playing with fields
You can insert a variety of interesting, dynamic information into a document
by using fields. The following sections go over some of my favorite fields. In
each case, I assume that the Field dialog box (refer to Figure 18-3) is visible
so that you can make your selections.
Page numbers
My favorite fields are the page number fields. For example, I may write in a
document “Here you are on page 246, and you still have to refer to Chapter 12
to find out about hanging indents!” To ensure that the document accurately
reflects the current page number, insert a current page number field:
1. In the Field dialog box, select Numbering from the Categories drop-
down list.
2. Select Page from the Field Names list.
3. In the Field Properties section of the Field dialog box, select a format
for the page number.
4. Click OK.
The current page’s number is plopped into your document. Of course, it
could also land in a header or footer or anywhere else.
246
Part III: Formatting 

Total number of pages
To insert the total number of pages in your document, heed these directions:
1. Select Document Information from the Categories drop-down list.
2. Select NumPages from the Field names list.
3. Select a format.
4. Click OK.
Word count
Getting paid by the word? Be sure to stick an automatic word count at the
end of your document:
1. From the Categories list, select Document Information.
2. Select NumWords from the Field Names list.
3. In the Field Properties section of the Field dialog box, select a format.
4. Click OK.
The print date
I like to stick the current date in my document’s header so that I know on
which day it was printed. Here’s how:
1. Select Date and Time from the Categories drop-down list.
2. Select PrintDate from the Field Names list.
3. In the Field Properties section of the Field dialog box, select a format.
4. Click OK.
Other date formats can be selected from the Date and Time category, but
only the PrintDate is updated each time you print the document.
247
Chapter 18: Misc. Formatting Stuff
Inserting the current-date-and-time trick
If you just want the date or time inserted into
your document, use the Text group on the Insert
tab. Clicking the Date and Time button in that
group displays a dialog box from which you can
choose how to insert the current date or time into
your document. You can even click the Update
Automatically option so that the date and time
text are always current.

Center a Page, Top to Bottom
Nothing makes a document title nice and crisp like having it sit squat in the
center of a page. The title is centered left to right, which you can do by
selecting Center alignment for the title’s paragraph. But how about centering
the title top to bottom? Word can do that too:
1. Move the insertion pointer to the start of your document.
The Ctrl+Home key combination moves you there instantly.
2. Type and format your document’s title.
It can be on a single line or on several lines.
To center the title, select it and press Ctrl+E, the Center keyboard short-
cut. Apply any additional font or paragraph formatting as necessary.
Avoid the temptation to press the Enter key to add space above or
below your title. Right now, the title sits by itself at the top of the page.
That will be fixed in a jiffy.
3. Insert a section break after the title’s last line: On the Page Layout tab,
choose Breaks➪Next Page from the Page Setup area.
The section break ensures that only the first page of your document is
centered top to bottom. Refer to Chapter 16 for more information on
document sections.
4. Ensure that the insertion pointer is once again on the document’s
first page.
You need to be on the page you want to format.
5. Summon the Page Setup dialog box: Click the Page Layout tab and
choose the Dialog Box Launcher from the lower-right corner of the
Page Setup area.
The Page Setup dialog box appears.
6. Click the Layout tab.
7. Select Center from the Vertical Alignment drop-down list.
You can find this item in the bottom half of the dialog box.
8. Confirm that the Apply To drop-down list shows This Section.
9. Click OK.
In Print Layout view, it’s easier to see the change than when you’re in Draft
view. Of course, you can use Print Preview (refer to Chapter 10) to confirm
that, indeed, the first page — and only the first page — of the document is
centered top to bottom.

Part III: Formatting 

Steal This Format!
Speaking of mad artists, the Paintbrush tool in the Clipboard group, on the
Home tab, can be used to paint character styles, by copying them from one
bit of text to another in your document. Here’s how:
1. Force the insertion pointer into the middle of the text that has the for-
matting you want to copy.
The insertion pointer must be in the midst of the word, not to the left or
right of it. (The pointer doesn’t have to be exactly in the middle — just
“in the word”). If it’s not, this trick doesn’t work.
2. On the Home tab, click the Format Painter command button in the
Clipboard group.
The cursor changes to a paintbrush/I-beam pointer, as depicted in the
margin. This special cursor is used to highlight and then reformat text
in your document.
3. Hunt for the text you want to change.
4. Highlight the text.
Drag the mouse over the text you want to change — to “paint” it.
(You must use the mouse here.)
Voilà! The text is changed.
Mad modern artists can also make use of the following tips and tidbits:
 The Format Painter works with only character and paragraph format-
ting, not with page formatting.
 To change the formatting of multiple bits of text, double-click the Format
Painter. That way, the Format Painter cursor stays active, ready to paint
lots of text. Press the Esc key to cancel your Dutch Boy frenzy.
 If you tire of the mouse, you can use the Ctrl+Shift+C key command to
copy the character format from a highlighted block to another location
in your document. Use the Ctrl+Shift+V key combination to paste the
character format elsewhere. Just highlight the text in your document
and press Ctrl+Shift+V to paste in the font formatting.
 You can sorta kinda remember Ctrl+Shift+C to copy character formatting
and Ctrl+Shift+V to paste because Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V are the copy-and-
paste shortcut keys. Sorta kinda.
 Don’t confuse the Format Painter with the highlighting tool, found in the

Making Your

All Fancy-
Schmancy

In this part . . .
T
he notion of a word processor goes well beyond simply
creating and formatting documents. During the Great
Word Processor Feature Wars of the 1980s and 1990s, the
duties and tasks assumed by the lowly word processor
grew to include complex drawing, graphics, and desktop
publishing abilities. Concerned that this would drive away
consumers, limited (“lite”) versions of word processors
were offered. No one bought them. So, obviously, there’s a
need in word processing for more than just writing and for-
matting. Yea, verily, there’s a need to make your documents
all fancy-schmancy. In this part of the book, you’re intro-
duced to some tools that help make that happen.

T
he days of whacking the hyphen, equal sign, or underline keys to deco-
rate your text are long over. It’s sad, too, because I knew quite a few
people who were adept at using the computer keyboard’s more interesting
symbol keys to draw boxes and lines and even graphics within their text. I
can understand the need, but what I don’t understand is why people don’t
simply use the borders, lines, and shading commands in Word, which are so
cleverly discussed in this very chapter.
This Border Situation
To fully understand how Word draws lines, you need to accept a few things.
First, they’re borders, not lines. I have this chapter indexed under both items
because too many people get frustrated with random lines in their text, yet
cannot find a solution because they think “line” and not “border.”
No, that’s not your fault.

The second thing to know about borders in Word is that they’re primarily
paragraph things. Borders are added above, below, or to either side of a para-
graph. You cannot add individual borders around single words, although you
can box words on all four sides.
 The border is applied to the paragraph that the insertion pointer is
blinking in.
 To apply the border to multiple paragraphs, select them with the mouse.
 Borders can also be applied to a page. Refer to the section “Putting a
border around a page of text,” later in this chapter.
 Not all lines in Word are borders. A thin border on the left margin of
a line of text can be a sign that something was changed on that line.
Refer to Chapter 27 for more information on revision marking.
The Border command button
Quick application of a border is possible, thanks to the Border command
button, found in the Home tab’s Paragraph group. Clicking that button imme-
diately applies a border to your text, or removes the borders, as is the case
with the No Border button shown in the margin.
When you click the menu part of the Border command button, a menu full of
border choices is made available, as shown in Figure 19-1. Choosing a border
from the menu not only applies that border to your text, but also changes the
Border command button to reflect that new border style.
Figure 19-1:
The Border
menu.
254
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

You can use only one border style from the Border menu at a time. Choosing
another style replaces the first style. If you want some combination of bor-
ders, you must use the Borders and Shading dialog box, as described in the
next section. That dialog box also allows you to change the line style, color,
and thickness of your border.
The Borders and Shading dialog box
For real control over borders, you summon the Borders and Shading dialog
box, shown in Figure 19-2. Choosing the Borders and Shading command from
the bottom of the Border menu (refer to Figure 19-1) does the job.
Unlike on the Border menu, several options are available in the Borders and
Shading dialog box for setting borders. Most notably, you can set the border
line style, thickness, and color.
Click the OK button to apply your border settings and close the dialog box,
or press Cancel to give up and quit.
Lines and Boxes Around Your Text
Here a line. There a line. Everywhere a line-line. This section describes various
ways to apply borders to your text. This section refers to the Border menu
and Borders and Shading dialog box, as described earlier in this chapter.

and Shading
dialog box.
255
Chapter 19: Borders, Boxes, and Background Color

Drawing a fat, thick line
Sometimes you need one of those fat, thick lines to break up your text. I dunno
why, but the how is to choose the Horizontal Line command from the Border
menu. Word inserts a thin, inky stroke running from the left to right margins
on a line all by itself.
 Unlike a border, the Horizontal Line isn’t attached to a paragraph, so it
doesn’t repeat for every new paragraph you type.
 To adjust the Horizontal Line, click to select it with the mouse. Six 
“handles” appear (top, bottom, and the four corners) around the
selected image. You can drag those handles with the mouse to set the
line’s width or thickness.
 Double-clicking the Horizontal Line displays a Format Horizontal Line
dialog box, where further adjustments can be made and color added.
 To remove the Horizontal Line, click once to select it and then press
either the Delete or Backspace key.
 Word’s Horizontal Line is essentially the same thing as the <HL> tag in
HTML Web page formatting.
Making rules
A common trick in page design is to apply a line above or below text. The line
is a rule, and it helps to break up the text, highlight a specific paragraph, or
create a block quote, callout, or pull quote. Here’s how:
1. Click the mouse to place the insertion pointer into a given paragraph
of text.
Yes, it works best if you’ve already written that paragraph. Remember
my admonition: Write first, format later.
2. Summon the Borders and Shading dialog box.
3. Choose a line style, thickness, and color, if needed.
4. Click the Top button.
5. Click the Bottom button.
6. Click OK.
You may also want to adjust the paragraph margins inward so that your text
further stands out on the page. Refer to Chapter 12 for more information.
256
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

If you press Enter to end the paragraph, you carry the border formatting with
the insertion pointer to the following paragraph. See the section “Removing
borders,” later in this chapter, to find out how to prevent that.
Boxing text or paragraphs
To stick a box around any spate of words or paragraphs, summon the
Borders and Shading dialog box and choose a Box style from the Setting
column: Box, Shadow, or 3-D. Click OK.
To ensure that the border is applied to text (words) and not to the entire
paragraph, choose Text from the Apply To drop-down list in the Borders and
Shading dialog box.
Word lets you create graphical pull quotes by putting text in graphical boxes.
Refer to Chapter 24 for more information on text boxes and pull quotes.
Boxing a title
Someday when you’re tasked with creating the organizational newsletter,
you can surprise all your coworkers by coming up with a fancy title, similar
to what’s shown in Figure 19-3. It looks all complex and such, but it’s really
nothing more than the careful application of borders plus some deft text,
paragraph, and tab stop skills.
The key to creating such a heading is to type the text first and then use the
Borders and Shading dialog box to add different border styles above and
below the paragraphs.
Use the Preview window to help determine the line style. You can click the
mouse on the lines in the Preview window to add or remove lines above or
below or to either side of the text.

Chapter 19: Borders, Boxes, and Background Color

Putting a border around a page of text
Borders are popular for pages as well as for paragraphs, although this can
often be a frustrating thing because the border may not print completely. I’ve
studied the issue and found the problem. My solution to the putting-a-border-
around-a-page-of-text puzzle is presented in these steps:
1. Put the insertion pointer on the page you want to border.
For example, on the first page in your document.
2. Summon the Borders and Shading dialog box.
3. Click the Page Border tab.
Whoa! The Page Border tab looks exactly like the Borders tab (refer to
Figure 19-2). Incredible.
4. Choose the border you want: Use a preset box or pick a line style,
color, and width.
Optionally, you can select a funky art pattern from the Art drop-down list.
5. Choose which pages you want bordered from the Apply To drop-
down list.
You can select Whole Document to put borders on every page. To select
the first page, choose the This Section - First Page Only item. Other options
let you choose other pages and groups, as shown in the drop-down list.
And now, the secret:
6. Click the Options button.
The Border and Shading Options dialog box appears.
7. From the Measure From drop-down list choose the option labeled Text.
The Edge of Page option just doesn’t work with most printers. Text does.
8. Click OK.
9. Click OK to close the Borders and Shading dialog box.
In Print Layout view, you can see the border applied. Yep, that’s how it’s
gonna look.
To add more “air” between your text and the border, use the Border Shading
Options dialog box (from Step 6) and increase the values in the Margin area.
Refer to Chapter 15 for more information on creating a section break in your
document. By using sections, you can greatly control which pages in a docu-
ment have borders and which do not.
258
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

To remove the page border, choose None under Setting and then click OK.
Removing borders
When you don’t listen to my advice and you format a paragraph before you
type its contents, notice that the borders stick with the paragraph like dis-
carded gum under your shoe. To peel the annoying borders from a para-
graph, you need to choose the No Border style.
From the Border menu, choose No Border.
In the Borders and Shading dialog box, double-click the None button and then
click OK.
You can also use the Borders and Shading dialog box to selectively remove
borders from text. Use the Preview window and click a specific border to
remove it.
Background Colors
The Borders and Shading dialog box is also the place where you apply a 
background color, or shade, to your text. The background color can go under
individual words, sentences, or paragraphs — any block of text — and weird
parts of your document, like a title, as shown in Figure 19-4. You can shade in
gray, color, and patterns with or without a border around it. It’s a veritable
smorgasbord of scribbles to junk up your text.
Figure 19-4:
A sample bit
o’ text with a
border and
shading.
259
Chapter 19: Borders, Boxes, and Background Color

Heed these steps:
1. Mark your text or title as a block.
Refer to Chapter 7 for efficient block-marking instructions.
If you want the shaded area to cover more than the title line, highlight
the lines before and after the title. That creates a “buffer” of shading
around the text.
2. Conjure up the Borders and Shading dialog box.
3. Make sure that the Shading panel is up front.
4. Select a shade from the Fill palette.
You have a choice of theme colors or standard colors, or you can whip
up your own color by choosing the More Colors command.
5. Click OK.
The text is shaded.
 You can apply shading to a single word by choosing Text from the Apply
To drop-down list.
 Applying background color to a page is best done by using the Page
Color command, as described in Chapter 14.
 To create white text on a black background, select the text and apply
white as the text foreground color (refer to Chapter 11). Then, from the
Shading tab in the Borders and Shading dialog box, apply black as the
background color.
 The best values to select for shading your text are gray. I’m fond of the
Text/Background 1, Shade 85% setting because it prints nicely
without wiping out the text.
 Try to avoid using the patterns. Although some of them may look like
gray-fills, they’re really ugly. I suppose that someone somewhere may find
them useful, but for shading text, they’re probably not what you need.

I
don’t mean to dash your dreams here, but set aside those thoughts of
buying power tools and visiting the lumber store. Take off the silly-looking
safety goggles. When you build a table in Word, you’re not working with
something that has four legs or a flat top or that anyone could consider as
furniture. A table in Word is a grid. It has rows and columns, into which you
can place text or graphics or — if you want to be eccentric — mathematical
formulas. All that is explained in this chapter, which touches upon tables,
from the teensy to the spectabular.
Furnish Forth the Tables
It can be argued that tables belong on the slate of things that a word proces-
sor can do. A table is merely information organized in a grid. The Tab key can
accomplish the same thing as a table, but the table just does it so much more
elegantly.

This section explores the various ways to create a table in Word. Before read-
ing it, I recommend mulling over the following points:
 Any time you need information in a grid, or in columns and rows, you’re
better off creating a table in Word than fussing with tabs and tab stops.
 Rows in a table go left and right across the screen.
 Columns in a table go up and down.
 Each cubbyhole in a table is a cell.
 Cells can have their own margins, text, and paragraph formats. You can
even stick graphics into cells.
 Unlike working with tabs, Word tables can be resized and rearranged to
fit your data. Try doing that with tabs!
 It helps to be in Print Layout view to best work with tables. The sections
in this chapter assume that you’re using Print Layout view, not Draft view.
Starting your table-creation fun
You can build a table from scratch, or you can convert text that’s already in
your document into a table. My advice is to start from scratch: Create the
table first and then fill it with information. Word allows you to add or remove
rows or columns, so there’s no need to be precise when you first start out.
Table creation happens on Word’s Insert tab, in the Tables group. Clicking the
Table button displays a menu of table-creation options, as shown in Figure 20-1.
The following sections discuss using the various items on the menu.
When you enter Table view in Word, two new tabs appear on the Ribbon:
Design and Layout, both of which appear beneath the label Table Tools.
Using these tabs is covered in the section “Table Craftsmanship,” later in
this chapter.
After filling the table, you can format it using the various table-formatting
tricks and techniques covered in the latter half of this chapter.
 Go ahead and be lazy! Use the Quick Tables submenu from the Table
menu (refer to Figure 20-1) to select a predesigned table and slap it
down into your document. Unless the table you need is on that sub-
menu, though, you’re better off manually creating a table, as described
in this chapter.
262
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

 If you’ve already typed the table’s data, or maybe the data you want
to put into a table is now formatted with tabs, refer to the section
“Transmuting tabbed text into a table,” later in this chapter.
 I recommend starting the table on a blank line by itself. Furthermore,
type a second blank line after the line you put the table on. That makes it
easier to continue typing text after the table is created.
 Consider placing large tables on a page by themselves. You can even
reorient the page horizontally in the middle of your document. Refer to
Chapter 14 for hints and tips.
Creating a table yay-by-yay big
The quickest way to instantly slap down a table in your document is to use
the grid thing at the top of the Table menu. (Refer to Figure 20-1.) Drag the
mouse through the grid to create a table in your document with the same
number of rows and columns as you select in the grid.
Figure 20-2 shows a 4-column-by-3-row table being created by dragging the
mouse. As you drag the mouse on the menu, the table’s grid appears in your
document.
Figure 20-1:
The Table
menu.
263
Chapter 20: Turning the Tables

 Just guess! You can add or remove rows or columns at any time in Word.
 The table is created with the same width as your document’s paragraph
margins. When you add more columns, each column gets smaller.
 Column width can be adjusted, as described elsewhere in this chapter.
 If you prefer a more right-brain approach to creating a table, choose the
Insert Table command from the Table menu. Use the Insert Table dialog
box to manually enter the number of rows and columns you need. Click
the OK button to plop down your table.
Drawing a table
Feeling artistic? Especially when your table may not be a pure grid or need
even columns and text, you can use a special drawing mode to splash down a
unique table in your document. Here’s how:
1. From the Table menu, choose Draw Table.
The insertion pointer changes to a pencil, which I call the pencil pointer.
2. Drag the mouse to “draw” the table’s outline in your document.
Start in the upper-left corner of where you envision your table and drag
to the lower-right corner, which tells Word where to put your table.
You see an outline of the table as you drag down and to the right, as
shown in Figure 20-3.
As you begin drawing, you see the Design tab appear and come forward.
The Draw Borders group contains tools to help you draw tables.
Don’t worry about making the table the right size; you can resize it later.
Notice that any text you already have in your document moves aside to
make room for the new table.
Figure 20-2:
The “I want
a table this
big” table-
creation
technique.
264
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

3. Use the pencil pointer to draw rows and columns.
As long as the mouse pointer looks like a pencil, you can use it to draw
the rows and columns in your table.
To draw a row, drag the pencil pointer from the left side to the right side
of the table.
To draw a column, drag the pencil pointer from the top to the bottom of
the table, as shown in Figure 20-4.
As you drag the pencil pointer, a dashed line appears, showing you where
the new row or column will be split. Figure 20-4 shows a table shaping up.
Also notice that you can split columns or rows into more cells by simply
dragging the pencil pointer inside a cell and not across the entire table.
Again, don’t worry if you have too many or too few rows or columns.
You can add or delete them later, as you see fit. And, don’t worry about
things being uneven; you can rearrange your rows and columns later.
4. Click the Draw Table button when you’re done creating the table’s
columns and rows.
The mouse pointer returns to normal. You can begin putting text in the
table.

Drawing a
column.
Figure 20-3:

table in a

265
Chapter 20: Turning the Tables

You can draw more lines in a table by simply clicking the Draw Table button
in the Design tab’s Draw Border’s group. The table you modify need not be
created by the Draw Table command, either; any table can be modified by
using that tool.
Transmuting tabbed text into a table
Tables make organizing data so easy that at some point you may be eager to
convert one of your crafty tabbed lists into a true table. This is cinchy in
theory, but in practice requires some tidying up. Still, it’s easier than turning
lead into gold. The basic steps to take are these:
1. Select the text you want to convert into a table.
It helps if the text is arranged into columns, with each column separated
by a tab character. If not, things get screwy, but still workable.
2. Choose Table➪Convert Text to Table.
The Convert Text to Table dialog box, which assists in the conversion.
As long as the text you selected is formatted into columns with tabs,
there’s no need to modify the settings in the dialog box. Otherwise, the
settings assist in converting your text.
3. Click OK.
A table is born.
You probably need to adjust things, reset column widths, and so on and so
forth. It may be a pain, but it’s better than retyping all that text.
 Sections elsewhere in this chapter explain how to adjust the text in your
table.
 The Convert Text to Table item is available only when text is selected,
and you’ll notice that the Table menu appears shorter than normal.
(Refer to Figure 20-1.)
Turning a table back into plain text
Word lets you easily help your text escape from the prison of a table’s cells.
It’s as easy as turning a beautiful princess into a toad, although unless you
have a magic wand handy, you probably want to follow these steps:
266
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

1. Click the mouse inside the table you want to convert.
2. Click the Layout tab.
The commands you need in order to perform the conversion are found
on the Table Tools Layout tab.
3. From the Table group, choose Select➪Select Table.
4. From the Data group, choose Convert to Text.
The Convert to Text dialog box appears.
5. Ensure that Tabs is chosen in the Convert Table to Text dialog box.
6. Click OK.
Bye-bye, table. Hello, ugly text.
As with converting text to a table, some cleanup is involved. Mostly, it’s reset-
ting the tabs (or removing them) — nothing complex or bothersome.
When a table’s cells contain longer expanses of text, consider choosing
Paragraph Marks in Step 5. That makes the text look less ugly after the 
conversion.
It’s Your Turn to Set the Table
Text pours into a table on a cell-by-cell basis. Each cell can have its own para-
graph format and its own set of tabs. Groups of cells, rows, columns, and the
entire table can be selected and formatted at one time, if you like. All the
standard text and paragraph formats apply to cells in a table just as they do
to regular text.
 You should take care to avoid paragraph indents and first-line indents
for text in a cell. It just works funky.
 It’s a boon to show the Ruler when you work with formatting a table.
Use the View Ruler button, as explained in Chapter 2.
Using the mouse with a table
A typical table skeleton is shown in Figure 20-5. You can use the mouse to
manipulate the table, whether it’s empty (as in the figure) or populated with
text. Here’s what you can do:
267
Chapter 20: Turning the Tables

 Click the mouse in a cell to move the insertion pointer into that cell.
 Triple-click the mouse in a cell to select all text in that cell.
 You can select a single cell by positioning the mouse in the cell’s lower-
left corner. The mouse pointer changes to a northeastward-pointing
arrow, as shown in the margin. Click to select the cell.
 Move the mouse into the left margin and click to select a row of cells.
 Move the mouse above a column and click to select that column.
When the mouse is in the “sweet spot,” the pointer changes to a 
downward-pointing arrow (shown in the margin).
 Selecting stuff in a table can also be accomplished from the Table group
on the Layout tab. Use the Select menu to select the entire table, a row, a
column, or a single cell.
 Positioning the mouse on a vertical line in the table’s grid changes the
mouse pointer to the thing shown in the margin. That allows you to
adjust the line left or right and resize the surrounding cells.
 You can also adjust cell width by using the ruler, by pointing the mouse at
the Move Table Column button that appears above each table cell gridline.
 Pointing the mouse at a horizontal line changes the mouse pointer to
what’s shown in the margin. At that time, you can use the mouse to adjust
the line up or down and change the row height of surrounding cells.
 Although you can use the Move Thing in the upper-left corner of the table
to move the table around your document, it’s often easier to select the
entire table and then copy and paste it elsewhere. The standard Cut and
Copy commands, described in Chapter 7, also work with tables in Word.
Putting text into a table
To populate your table with text, simply type. All the text you type fits into a
single cell. Cells grow taller to accommodate long bits of text. Certain keys
perform special functions within the table:
Click to select table/drag table
Drag to resize table
Figure 20-5:
Parts of the
basic table.
268
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

 Tab: To move to the next cell, press the Tab key. This moves you from
cell to cell, from left to right. Pressing Tab in the last column moves you
down to the next row.
 Shift+Tab: To move backward to the previous cell, press Shift+Tab.
 Arrow keys: The up, down, left, and right keys also move you around
within the table, but they still move within any text in a cell. Therefore,
using the arrow keys to move from cell to cell is rather inefficient.
 Enter: The Enter key adds a new paragraph to a cell.
 Shift+Enter: The Shift+Enter key combination can break up long lines of
text in a cell with a soft return.
 Ctrl+Tab: To use any tabs or indentation within a cell, press Ctrl+Tab
rather than Tab.
By the way, pressing the Tab key in the table’s last, lower-right cell automati-
cally adds another row to the table.
Table Craftsmanship
There’s no point in making ugly tables. Word gives you the basic table layout,
which you fill with text. The next thing you can do, after filling the tables with
text, is to give them style. To help you do so, two Table Tools tabs appear
whenever you work with a table: Design and Layout. This section describes
various things you can do with the commands found on those two tabs.
The Table Tools tabs show up only when a table is being edited or selected.
Designing a table
Use the Table Tools Design tab, shown in Figure 20-6, to quickly or slowly
format your table.
Figure 20-6:
The Design
tab.
269
Chapter 20: Turning the Tables

The Table Styles group can quickly apply formatting to any table. Choose a
style or click the menu button to see a whole smattering of styles. As with
Quick Styles (refer to Chapter 16), as you point the mouse at a table style,
your table is updated to reflect the new style.
Settings chosen in the Table Style Options group determine how the table
styles shape up. Choose an option to apply that type of formatting to the
table styles, such as Header Row to format a separate header row for the table.
The following sections discuss various things you can play with to design a
table.
Setting table line styles
The lines you see in a table’s grid are the same borders you can apply to text
with the Border command button, discussed in Chapter 19. The Border com-
mand button chooses where the lines go; items on the left side of the Draw
Borders group set the border line style, width, and color.
The border changes you make apply to whichever part of the table is selected.
Refer to the section “Using the mouse with a table,” earlier in this chapter, for
tips on selecting parts of a table.
Removing a table’s lines
Occasionally, you may want a table without any lines. For example, I typically
use a one-column, two-row table to put a picture and its caption in my text.
To remove the table’s grid in that and other situations, select the table and
choose No Border from the Borders menu.
Having no lines (borders) in a table makes working with the table more 
difficult. The solution is to show the table gridlines, which aren’t printed.
To do that, select the table and choose the Show Gridlines command from
the Border menu.
Merging cells
You can combine two or more cells in a table by simply erasing the line that
separates them. To do so, click the Eraser command button found in the
Draw Borders group. The mouse pointer changes to a bar of soap, but it’s
really supposed to be an eraser (shown in the margin). Use that tool to erase
lines in the table: Click a line and it’s gone.
Erasing the line between cells merges the cells’ contents, by combining the text.
You cannot remove the outside lines of the table. (To convert the table to text,
see the section “Turning a table back into plain text,” earlier in this chapter.
To delete a table, see the section “Deleting a table,” at the end of this chapter.
270
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

Click the Eraser button again when you’re done merging.
Splitting cells
To turn one cell into two, you simply draw a line, horizontally or vertically,
through the cell. Do so by clicking the Draw Table command button in the
Draw Borders group. The mouse pointer changes to the pencil pointer, which
you can use to draw new lines in the table.
Click the Draw Table button again to turn off this feature.
Adjusting the table
After the table is splashed down into your document, you can mess with it in
uncountable ways. The messing is made possible by the Table Tools Layout
tab, shown in Figure 20-7. Various commands in the Layout tab’s groups help
you customize and adjust your table. The sections that follow highlight some
popular tricks.
Deleting cells, columns, or rows
The key to deleting all or part of a table is to first position the insertion
pointer in the part of the table you want to remove. Then choose the table
element to remove from the Delete button’s menu.
 The table’s contents are also deleted when you delete parts of a table.
 The Delete Cells command displays a dialog box asking what to do with
the other cells in the row or column: move them up or to the left. Yes,
deleting a cell may make your table asymmetrical.
Inserting columns or rows
You can expand a table by adding rows or columns, and the rows or columns
can be added inside the table or appended to any of the table’s four sides.
Four commands in the Rows & Columns group make this possible: Insert
Above, Insert Below, Insert Left, and Insert Right. The row or column that’s
added is relative to where the insertion pointer is within the table.
Figure 20-7:

Adjusting row and column size
Gizmos in the Cell Size group let you fine-tune the table’s row height or
column width. Adjustments that are made affect the row or column contain-
ing the insertion pointer.
The Distribute Rows and Distribute Columns command buttons help clean up
uneven column or row spacing in a table. With the insertion pointer anywhere
in the table, click either or both buttons to even things out.
Aligning text
Text within a cell can be aligned just like a paragraph: left, center, or right.
Additionally, the text can be aligned vertically: top, middle, or bottom.
Combine these options and you have an explanation for the nine orientation
buttons in the Alignment group.
For example, to make the title row align at the bottom center of each cell, first
select the top row in your table and then click the Align Top Center button.
Reorienting text
The Text Direction button in the Alignment group changes the way text reads
in a cell or group of selected cells. Normally, text is oriented from left to right.
By clicking the Text Direction button once, you change the text direction to
top-to-bottom. Click the button again and direction is changed to bottom-to-
top. Clicking a third time restores the text to normal.
Sadly, you cannot do upside-down text with the Text Direction button.
Deleting a table
To utterly remove the table from your document, click the mouse inside the
table and then choose Delete➪Table from the Rows & Columns group on the
Layout tab.. The table is blown to smithereens.
 Yes, deleting the table deletes its contents as well.
 If you’d rather merely convert the table’s contents into plain text, refer to
the section “Turning a table back into plain text,” earlier in this chapter.

I
f someone asks about columns and you immediately think of Doric, Ionic,
and Corinthian, then know that somewhere your ninth-grade history
teacher is smiling proudly. That’s because few people outside the publishing
industry relate columns to text. The fact that Word bothers to place text into
multiple columns on a page is merely fallout from the word processor feature
wars of decades past. Yet columns remain something that Word lets you do
with your document. Whether you find columns a useful feature or not, you
can better decide after wading through this chapter.
All About Columns
All text you write in Word is already formatted in a column, one column per
page. Most folks don’t think of things that way — that is, until you start talking
about two or three columns of text per page. Such a feat is entirely possible,
thanks to the Columns command button, found in the Page Setup group on
the Page Layout tab.

Clicking the Columns button displays a menu of handy column-formatting
options, as shown in Figure 21-1. Splitting your text into columns is as easy as
choosing a column format from that list. Or, you can choose the More Columns
command, which displays the enticing Columns dialog box. By using that
dialog box, you can create and design your own set of multiple columns.
Consider the following advice when you’re creating or working with columns:
 Word’s paragraph formatting also applies to columns. The column’s left
and right sides are equivalent to the paragraph margins.
 Rather than use the cursor-movement keys to move the insertion pointer
between columns, use the mouse. It’s much easier to point and click in a
column than to watch the insertion pointer fly all over the page.
 Columns are a section thing. You can break up your document between
pages formatted normally and pages with columns by using sections.
Refer to Chapter 15 for the details.
Figure 21-1:
The Columns
menu.

Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 
For advanced formatting, nothing beats DTP
I’ll be honest up front: When you desire columns
for whatever you’re writing, what you really
need is desktop publishing, or DTP, software.
Desktop publishing isn’t about writing; it’s about
assembling already written text with graphics
and other design elements and then laying
things out as a professional would. DTP is built
for such a thing. It can handle it.
Word’s ability to march text into columns isn’t
its best feature. Columns work for smaller 
documents — say, one-sheet newsletters or
fliers. Beyond that, I highly recommend using
DTP software for your demanding documents.
Both Adobe InDesign and Microsoft Publisher
are good places to start, if you’re interested in
DTP software.

 When you’re working with columns and notice that Word starts acting
slow and fussy, save your work!
 Although using columns for a short document seems to work well in
Word, putting text into columns in a document of ten pages or more is
better done in a desktop publishing program (DTP). See the nearby side-
bar “For advanced formatting, nothing beats DTP.”
Here Come the Columns!
To convert your standard single- (or no-) column document into one with
multiple columns, simply choose the column format you want from the
Columns menu. (Refer to Figure 21-1.) Instantly, your document is trans-
formed into a multicolumn wonder!
 To best see columns in action, use Print Layout view.
 Two columns are sufficient to impress anyone. More columns make your
text skinnier and more difficult to read.
 To have only a portion of your document use columns, refer to the sec-
tion “Mixing column formats,” a little later in this chapter.
Making more than three columns
The Columns menu lists only two-column formats, plus one three-column
format. For anything different, such as more than three columns, choose
Columns➪More Columns and use the Number of Columns box, shown in
Figure 21-2.
Figure 21-2:
The
Columns
dialog box.
275
Chapter 21: Carousing with Columns

Set the number of columns you want by using the Number of Columns box.
Use the Preview window to help determine how your page is formatted.
Click the OK button to apply the column format to your document.
 The three-column text format works nicely on paper in Landscape
mode. This method is how most trifold brochures are created. Refer
to Chapter 14 for information on Landscape mode.
 Maximum number of columns per page? That depends on the size of the
page. Word’s minimum column width is half an inch, so a typical sheet of
paper can have up to 12 columns on it — not that such a layout would
be appealing or anything.
Mixing column formats
Your whole document doesn’t have to sport just one column format. You can
split things up so that part of the document is one column, and another part
is two columns, and then maybe another part goes back to one column.
The secret is to use the Columns dialog box. (Refer to Figure 21-2.)
When you’re choosing a new column format, be sure to check the Apply To
drop-down list. When you choose Whole Document, the format applies to the
entire document. If you choose This Point Forward, the new columns start at
the insertion pointer’s location.
Choosing This Point Forward inserts a continuous section break into your
document. So the real solution to mixing column formats is to read about 
sections in Chapter 15 and then divide your document into sections and
apply the column formats accordingly.
Adjusting the columns in 
the Columns dialog box
There isn’t much to formatting columns, other than setting their width and
the space between them. This is done in the Columns dialog box. (Refer to
Figure 21-2.) Here are some points to ponder:
 You can make specific column adjustments in the Width and Spacing
area of the dialog box.
 If you want an attractive line between the columns of text, put a check
in the Line Between box. (Note: There’s no attractiveness guarantee for
the line.)
276
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

 Use the Preview window to get an idea of what the heck you’re doing.
 The space between columns is the gutter. Word sets the width of the
gutter at 0.5" — half an inch. This amount of white space is pleasing to
the eye without being too much of a good thing.
The End of the Column
There are several ways to end a column of text. Here are three of them:
 Create a column break. When you want to keep on using columns but
want the text you’re writing to start at the top of the next column, you
need a column break. Heed these steps:
1. Place the insertion pointer where you want your text to start at
the top of the next column.
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
3. From the Page Setup group, choose Breaks➪Column.
The text hops up to the top of the next column.
 Return to Single Column mode. To stop the page format from including
columns and return to standard one-column text, follow these steps:
1. Place the insertion pointer where you want your columns
to stop.
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
3. From the Page Setup area, choose Columns➪More Columns.
4. In the Columns dialog box, choose One from the Presets area.
5. From the Apply To drop-down list, select This Point Forward.
6. Click OK.
The columns stop, and regular, one-column text is restored.
 Remove columns from a document. To remove all signs of columns
from your document, repeat the previous set of steps, but in Step 5,
select Whole Document. All text is then restored to Single-Column mode.
Removing columns from a document doesn’t remove any section breaks.
You must manually delete them. See Chapter 15.

In This Chapter
 Automatically bulleting or numbering text
 Numbering lines on a page 
 Adding a TOC to your document
 Creating an index
 Using footnotes and endnotes
W
ord deals with lists in several ways. Allow me to list them: First, it can
help you organize and spiff up lists you may have in your document
by applying bullets or numbers. Second, Word lets you create specialized
lists based on your document’s contents, such as a table of contents, a list
of figures, or an index. Finally, Word lets you “go academic” by providing
easy ways to create footnotes or endnotes, which aren’t lists but are handy
to have when fussy professors demand such things. This chapter lists all
that stuff.
Basic Bullets and Numbers
There are many ways to punctuate a list. You can try hanging indents, make
the first few words bold, or take advantage of Word’s list-enhancing features,
as covered in this section.
 Bullets and numbers are handled in the Home tab’s Paragraph group.
 The Multilevel List command is best applied when you have a list that’s
indented. Pressing the Tab key to indent a line uses the next level’s
format.

Making a bulleted list
In typesetting, a bullet is merely a graphic, such as a ball or dot, used to high-
light items in a list. The word bullet comes from the French word boulette and
has nothing to do with those things that come flinging from a firearm, like this:
 Bang!
 Bang!
 Bang!
To apply bullets to your text, highlight the paragraphs you want to shoot and
choose the Bullets command button, from either the Home tab’s Paragraph
group or the Mini Toolbar. Instantly, your text is not only formatted with bul-
lets but is also indented and made all tidy.
 You can choose a different bullet by clicking the menu button by the
Bullets command. Choose your new bullet graphic from the list that
appears, or use the Define New Bullet command to dream up your own
bullet style.
 Bullets are a paragraph format. As such, they stick to the paragraphs you
type. To halt the bullets, click the Bullet command button again, and
they’re removed from the paragraph format.
Numbering a list
One good way to punctuate a list is to number it. The numbers make it easy
to refer to items within the list as well as to prioritize items in the list.
To number a list, select the paragraphs with the mouse and click the
Numbering command button. Each paragraph is numbered starting with 1
and continuing through however many paragraphs are in the list. The para-
graphs are also formatted so that the number appears as a hanging indent.
 Choose a different number style or format, including Roman numerals or
ABCs, by clicking the menu button next to the Numbering command.
Choose the numbering style you want from the menu, or click the Define
New Number Format command to create your own numbering style.
 To remove numbers, simply click the Numbering button again. This
removes numbering from the paragraph format.
280
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

Numbering lines of text
Word lets you slap down numbers for every line on a page, which is a feature
that’s popular with those in the legal profession as well as with folks who
write radio scripts. It was also a feature that many former WordPerfect users
demanded from Word. Here’s how it goes:
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
2. In the Page Setup group, click the Line Numbers command button to
display its menu.
The menu is shown in Figure 22-1.
3. Choose a numbering format from the menu.
Now each line in your document is numbered.
Choosing the Line Numbering Options command from the menu displays the
Page Setup dialog box. From there, click the Line Numbers button to summon
the Line Numbers dialog box. Use that dialog box to create custom numbers
and formatting for your document.
For example, use the Line Numbers dialog box to start each page with a
number other than 1 or to number lines by twos or threes.
Lists of Things in Your Document
Word sports a References tab that contains groups of commands you can use
to build custom lists in your documents. For example, Word can automatically
build a table of contents. Or, you can quickly create a list of figure captions.
Word can also whip together an index, complete with the real page numbers.
This section covers the two most common list-making tricks: the table of con-
tents and the index.

Chapter 22: I Love Lists

Creating a table of contents
One great example of how computers can save you time — and I’m not 
kidding — is to let Word create a table of contents (TOC) for your document.
No, there’s no need to manually type in a TOC. As long as you use the built-in
heading styles, Word can slap down a custom TOC in your document as easy
as following these steps:
1. Create a separate page for the TOC.
Word slaps down the table of contents wherever you put the insertion
pointer, but I prefer to have the thing on its own page. Refer to Chapter
14 for information on creating new pages; a new, blank page near the
start of your document is ideal for a TOC.
2. Click the mouse to place the insertion pointer on the new, blank page.
The TOC will be inserted at that point.
3. Click the References tab.
4. In the Table of Contents group, click the Table of Contents button.
The Table of Contents menu appears.
5. Choose an item from the menu based on what you want the table of
contents to look like.
And, there’s your TOC.
You may have to scroll up to see the Table of Contents. You may also want to
add a title above the TOC, something clever like, “Table of Contents.”
 Cool people in publishing refer to a table of contents as a TOC, pro-
nounced either “tee-o-see” or “tock.”
 You can update a TOC if your document’s contents change: Click the
mouse in the TOC and choose the Update Field command from the pop-
up menu.
 Use the Table of Contents dialog box (refer to Step 5) to modify the way
your TOC looks, set various options, and apply interesting styles.
 When the steps in this section don’t seem to produce anything, it usually
means that your document headings aren’t formatted with the Heading
styles.
 Word bases the TOC on text formatted with the Heading styles in your
document. As long as you use Heading 1 for main heads, Heading 2 for
subheads, and Heading 3 (and so on) for lower-level heads and titles, the
TOC will be spot-on.
282
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

 Word’s Table of Contents command also picks up your own styles format-
ting with a specific outline level. Suppose that you create a style named
Ahead. Because that style is formatted as Outline Level 1, it’s treated
the same as the Heading 1 style when Word creates a TOC. To set the
outline level for a paragraph style, use the Outline Level drop-down list
in the Paragraph dialog box. (See Chapter 12 for paragraph-formatting
information.)
Building an index
An index does the same thing as a table of contents, but with more detail and
at the opposite end of the document. Also, the index is organized by topic or
keyword as opposed to the organizational description a TOC offers.
Creating an index in Word is a two-part process. The first step is to identify
the words or phrases in a document that need to be referenced in the index.
The second part involves Word taking those references and automatically
building the index for you. The following sections explain the details.
All indexing actions and commands take place under the realm of the
References tab, in the Index group.
 Yes, it’s a really good thing to have written your document before you
create the index.
 Word allows you to change your document after the index is created.
Note that you first have to rebuild the index as well as mark any new
text for inclusion in the index.
 Studies done by people wearing white lab coats have shown that more
readers refer to an index than to a table of contents. Therefore, make
sure that your index is good and thorough.
Selecting text for the index
To flag a bit of text for inclusion in the index, follow these steps:
1. Select the text you want to reference in the index.
The text can be a word or phrase or any old bit of text. Mark that text as
a block.
2. Click the Mark Entry button (in the Index group on the References tab).
The Mark Index Entry dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 22-2.
Notice that the text you selected in your document appears in the Main
Entry box. (You can edit that text, if you want.)
You can optionally type a subentry, which further clarifies the main
entry. This is especially useful when the main entry is a broad topic.
283
Chapter 22: I Love Lists

3. Click either the Mark button or the Mark All button.
The Mark button marks only this particular instance of the word for
inclusion in the index. Use this button when you want to mark only
instances that you think will benefit the reader the most.
The Mark All button directs Word to seek out and flag all instances of the
text in your document, to create an index entry for each and every one.
Use this option when you would rather leave it to your reader to decide
what’s relevant.
When you mark an index entry, Word activates the Show/Hide com-
mand, where characters such as spaces, paragraph marks, and tabs
appear in your document. Don’t let it freak you out. Step 6 tells you how
to turn that thing off.
The Index code appears in the document something like this:
{⋅XE⋅”spanking”⋅}. The code is hidden when you turn off Show/
Hide mode.
4. Continue scrolling through your document and looking for stuff to put
into the index.
The Mark Index Entry dialog box stays open, allowing you to continue to
create your index: Just select text in the document, and then click the
Mark Index Entry dialog box. The selected text appears in the Main Entry
box. Click the Mark or Mark All button to continue building the index.
5. Click the Close button when you’re done.
The Mark Index Entry dialog box goes away.
6. Press Ctrl+Shift+8 to cancel the Show/Hide command.
Use the 8 key on the keyboard, not on the numeric keypad.

dialog box.
284
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

Creating the index
After selecting, collecting, and marking all bits and pieces of text from your
document for inclusion in the index, the next step is to create the index.
Do this:
1. Position the insertion pointer where you want the index to appear.
The index is inserted at that point in your document. If you want the
index to start on a new page, create a new page in Word (see Chapter 14).
I also recommend putting the index at the end of your document, which
is what the reader expects.
2. Choose the Insert Index button from the Index group on the
References tab.
The Index dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 22-3.
Here are some recommendations I have for this dialog box:
• The Print Preview window is misleading. It shows how your index
will look but doesn’t use your actual index contents.
• Use the Formats drop-down list to select a style for your index.
Just about any choice in that list is better than the From Template
example.
• The Columns list tells Word how many columns wide to make the
index. Note that two columns are standard, although I usually
switch to one column, which looks better on the page, especially
for shorter documents.
• I prefer to use the Right Align Page Numbers option.
Figure 22-3:
The Index
and
Tables/Index

285
Chapter 22: I Love Lists

3. Click the OK button to insert the index into your document.
4. Review the index.
Do this now, and do not edit any text. Just look.
5. Press Ctrl+Z if you dislike the index layout, and start these steps over
again.
If you think that the index is okay, you’re done.
As with other magical lists in Word, the index can be updated when you go
back and change your document. Refer to the next section.
 Feel free to add a heading for the index because Word doesn’t do this
for you.
 Word places the index into its own document section by using continuous
section breaks. Refer to Chapter 15 for more information on sections.
Updating the index
Word has made it easy for you to update a document’s index in case you go
back and meddle with things or decide to mark more entries for inclusion in
the index.
To update a document’s index, click the mouse on the index. Then choose
the Update Index command button from the Index group. Instantly, Word
updates the index to reference any new page numbers and include new
marked index entries.
Footnotes and Endnotes
The difference between a footnote and an endnote is that one appears on the
same page as the reference and the other appears at the end of the document.
A footnote contains bonus information, a clarification, or an aside, and an end-
note is a reference or citation. But I’m only guessing.
In both cases, the footnote or endnote is flagged by a superscripted number or
letter in the text, like this1. And, both are created in the same manner, like this:
1. Click the mouse so that the insertion pointer is immediately to the
right of the text that you want the footnote or endnote to reference.
2. Click the References tab.
286
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 
1Made you look!

3. From the Footnotes group, choose either the Insert Footnote or Insert
Endnote command button.
A number is superscripted to the text.
In Print Layout view, you’re instantly whisked to the bottom of the page
(footnote) or the end of the document (endnote), where you type the
footnote or endnote.
In Draft view, a special window near the bottom of the document opens,
displaying footnotes or endnotes.
4. Type the footnote or endnote.
There’s no need to type the note’s number; that’s done for you
automatically.
Footnotes are automatically numbered starting with 1.
Endnotes are automatically numbered starting with Roman numeral i.
5. Click the Show Notes button to exit the footnote or endnote.
You return to the spot in your document where the insertion pointer
blinks (from Step 1).
Here are some non-footnote endnote notes:
 The keyboard shortcut for inserting a footnote is Alt+Ctrl+F.
 The keyboard shortcut for inserting an endnote is Atl+Ctrl+D.
 The footnote and endnote numbers are updated automatically so that all
footnotes and endnotes are sequential in your document.
 Use the Next Footnote button’s menu to browse between footnote and
endnote references in your document.
 You can see a footnote or endnote’s contents by pointing the mouse at
the superscripted number in the document’s text.
 Use the Show Notes button to help you examine footnotes or endnotes
themselves.
 To quick-edit a footnote or endnote, double-click the footnote number
on the page. Use the Show Notes button to return to your document.
 To delete a footnote, highlight the footnote’s number in your document
and press the Delete key. Word magically renumbers any remaining foot-
notes for you.

A
picture is worth a thousand words.
It doesn’t matter that this so-called ancient Chinese proverb was coined by
an American in the 20th century. The essence of the saying is true: It’s much
easier to just paste in a picture of your time machine plans than it is to
describe everything with words. Word understands this truth, and therefore
it’s more than accommodating when you want to mix words and pictures.
This chapter provides the details.
 Word prefers that you view your document in Print Layout mode when
you’re working with graphics.
 The more images you add in Word, the more sluggish it becomes. My
advice: Write first. Add the graphics last. Save often.
 Word lets you use graphics from any other graphics program you have
in Windows. Often times, it works better to use those other programs
to create and refine an image, save the image to disk, and then put it
into Word.

Here Come the Graphics!
Watch out, text! You’re no longer alone in the document, naked to fend for
yourself. Behold the graphic image! It’s nothing to fear. In fact, well-placed, a
graphic can enhance a document’s value.
Inserting a picture from a file on disk
The most common type of image you stick into your documents is a graphi-
cal file stored on your PC’s hard drive. No matter how the image got on the
hard drive, you can stick a copy of that image into your document by heeding
these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. From the Illustrations group, click the Picture button.
The Insert Picture dialog box appears.
It looks similar to the Open dialog box, and it works exactly the same.
(Refer to Chapter 9 for details.) The difference is that you use the Insert
Picture dialog box to hunt down graphical images.
Use the Insert Picture’s dialog box Views command button menu (in the
far upper-right corner) to help you visually browse for images. In
Windows Vista, choose the Extra Large Icons command; in Windows XP,
choose Preview.
3. Use the dialog box controls to browse for the image you want.
4. Click to select the image file.
5. Click the Insert button.
The image is plopped down into your document.
The image is placed in-line with your text, meaning that it appears wherever
the insertion pointer is blinking. You may also notice that the image is huge.
Don’t fret! Working with graphics in Word involves more than just inserting
images into a document. Here are some things to consider:
 You can move the image around in your document; refer to the direc-
tions starting with the section “Images and Text Can Mix,” later in this
chapter.
 After inserting images, most folks do some image editing, or at least
some resizing. See the section “Image Editing,” later in this chapter.
290
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

 Word recognizes and understands just about all popular graphics file
formats.
 A cool thing to stick at the end of a letter is your signature. Use a desk-
top scanner to scan your John Hancock. Save it as a file on disk, and
then follow the preceding steps to insert the signature in the proper
place in your document.
Inserting a clip art image
Clip art is a collection of images, both line art and pictures, that you’re free to
use in your documents. In most cases, the result is the same as inserting a
picture, although you’re using images from a clip art library rather than
graphics files on your PC’s hard drive. Here’s how it goes:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. From the Illustrations group, click the Clip Art button.
The Clip Art task pane appears, as shown in Figure 23-1.
Just as you would search your hard drive for a picture, you search the
Clip Art library for artwork. The difference is that, unlike your digital life
on the computer’s hard drive, the Clip Art library is organized.
Figure 23-1:
The Clip Art
task pane.
291
Chapter 23: Going Graphical

3. In the Search For box, type a description of what you want.
For example, a picture of Napoleon may go well with your report on the
War of 1812. Type Napoleon in the box.
4. Click the Go button.
The results are displayed in the task pane (refer to Figure 23-1). Peruse
the results and note that you may have to scroll a bit to see all of them.
If you don’t find what you want, go back to Step 3 and refine your search.
5. Point the mouse at the image you want.
A menu button appears. (Look to the right of the heart in Figure 23-1).
6. Click the menu button and choose Insert.
The image is plopped down into your document.
7. Close the Clip Art task pane by clicking the X in its upper-right corner.
Word sticks the clip art graphic right into your text, just like it’s a big charac-
ter, right where the insertion pointer is blinking. At this point, you probably
want to move the image, resize it, or do other things. Later sections in this
chapter explain the details.
 Apparently, the clips are free to use; I don’t see anything saying otherwise.
But, then again . . .
 The problem with clip art is that it’s inanely common. For example, only
four images of Napoleon are available (as this book goes to press). That
means the image you choose will doubtless be used by someone else.
This gives clip art an air of unoriginality.
 Clip art libraries exist that you can buy at the software store, such as
those One Zillion Clip Art Pix things that also come with fonts and other
interesting toys. Because those images are stored on CDs or DVDs,
you need to use the Picture command button to insert them into your
documents. Refer to the preceding section.
Slapping down an AutoShape
Rather than have you fuss over creating basic shapes with various line-
drawing tools, Word comes with a library of common line art shapes ready
to insert into your document. These can be used decoratively or to create
illustrations. Here’s how to stick some AutoShapes into your document:

2. On the Insert tab, click the Shapes button to display a menu full of
AutoShapes.
The Shapes button is found in the Illustrations group.
3. Click to select the shape you desire.
And . . . nothing happens! Actually, the mouse pointer changes to a large
plus sign. Unlike with pictures and clip art, you must draw the shape in
your document:
4. Drag the mouse down and to the right to create the AutoShape.
The AutoShape artwork appears.
AutoShapes float over your text, so you probably want to use some type of
text wrapping to ensure that your artwork doesn’t hide your writing. (I
explain how to do that later in this chapter, starting with the section “Images
and Text Can Mix.”) Other sections in this chapter tell you how to modify the
AutoShape, by giving it color, effects, and a whole lotta flair.
 All shapes are drawn with black lines, although some shapes are solid
and some are see-through. (Actually, the solid images merely have a
white fill color.)
 Some shapes require you to click the mouse two or three times to draw
a line or create a curve.
Inserting a picture or text
into an AutoShape
Certain AutoShapes can be used as frames, to enclose a picture or even some
text. Simply follow the directions in the preceding section, but choose
instead an AutoShape that can be used as a frame, like a polygon. With that
shape selected, follow the steps in the following section as appropriate.
Making an AutoShape framed picture
Stick a picture in your AutoShape by obeying these steps:
1. From the Format tab’s Shape Styles group, choose Shape Fill➪Picture.
A Select Picture dialog box appears. It works just like any Open dialog
box, but it’s geared toward finding pictures.
293
Chapter 23: Going Graphical

2. Use the Select Picture dialog box to hunt down and choose an image.
3. Click the Insert button.
The picture is placed in the frame.
Making an AutoShape text box
Turn your AutoShape into a text box this way:
1. From the Format tab’s Insert Shapes group, click the Edit Text button.
The AutoShape is changed into a text box, and the Text Box Tools
Format tab appears.
2. Type and format the text you want in the box.
Be careful! Only the text you see appears in the box. Any excess text
doesn’t show up.
Refer to Chapter 24 for more information on text boxes.
Deleting an image or artwork
Getting rid of artwork in a document isn’t the same as removing text.
Graphics are special. The proper way to delete them is to click the image
once to select it. Then press the Delete key.
Images and Text Can Mix
There are three different ways you can place graphics into your document:
 In-line: The graphic works like a large, single character sitting in the
middle of your text. The graphic stays with the text, so you can press
Enter to put it on a line by itself, press Tab to indent the image, and so on.
 Wrapped: Text flows around the graphic, avoiding the image like every-
one at the casino buffet avoids the healthy fruit bar.
 Floating: The image appears behind your text like it’s part of the paper,
or it slaps down on top of your text like some bureaucratic tax stamp.
You’re not stuck with these choices. You can modify any graphic in Word to
be in-line, wrapped, or floating. The next section tells you how.
 The Picture and Clip Art commands insert art as in-line graphics.
 AutoShapes are inserted floating in front of your text.
294
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

Wrapping text around the image
I use the terms in-line, wrapped, and floating to describe how Word places text
into a document. Word uses seven different terms to control how graphics
and text mix. But as long as you think in-line, wrapped, and floating, you’ll
keep your sanity.
To control how an image and text interact, click the image to select it. When
the image is selected, the Format tab appears, from which you can choose the
Text Wrapping menu, found in the Arrange group and shown in Figure 23-2.
Here are my general thoughts on the wrapping options available on that menu:
 In Line With Text: The image is treated like text — specifically, like a
large, single character. The image can have text before it or behind it, 
be in the middle of a paragraph of text, or be on a line by itself. But the
image stays with the text as you edit, and the line that the image is on
grows extra vertical space to accommodate the image.
 Square: The image sits on the same plane as the text, but the text flows
around the image in a square pattern, regardless of the image’s shape.
 Tight: Text flows around the image and hugs its shape.
 Behind Text: The image floats behind the text, looking almost like the
image is part of the paper.
 In Front of Text: The image floats on top of your text, like a photograph
dropped on the paper.
 Top and Bottom: Text stops at the top of the image and continues below
the image.
 Through: Text flows around the image as best it can, similar to the Tight
option.
Figure 23-2:
The Text
Wrapping
menu.
295
Chapter 23: Going Graphical

 Edit Wrap Points: This command allows you to specifically control how
text wraps around an image. By adjusting tiny handles and dashed red
lines, you can really make text wrapping as tight or creative as you like.
Of course, selecting the Tight option pretty much does the same thing.
 More Layout Options: This option summons the Advanced Layout
dialog box, which provides custom controls for image position as well as
wrapping options.
Should you make the gutsy choice to edit the wrap points, here’s a quick
summary of the mouse commands used to manipulate the dashed red lines
and handles that separate the image from the text:
 Use the mouse to move a handle.
 Ctrl+click a handle to delete it.
 Ctrl+click a red line to add a handle.
Moving an image hither and thither
You can lug around graphics in a document as easily as you move text.
Consider the graphic as a block, and simply drag it by using the mouse. Of
course, how the graphic sits with your text, as covered in the preceding sec-
tion, determines where and how you can move it. Basically, it works like this:
 Point the mouse in the center of the image to drag it around.
 Try not to point at one of the image’s handles and drag. (Look ahead to
Figure 23-3.) When you do, you end up resizing the image rather than
moving it.
Choosing a specific position for the image
A handy way to place any graphic at a specific spot on the page is to use the
Position command button, found in the Drawing Tools Format tab’s Arrange
group. Clicking that button displays a menu full of options for locating an
image to the left, right, center, top, or bottom, or a combination of these.
 Before using the Position command button, zoom out so that your docu-
ment’s page fills the screen. Then you can see how choosing different
options from the Position menu affects the page as you point the mouse
at each one. See Chapter 30 for more information on zooming.
 To center an in-line image, put the image on a line by itself (a paragraph)
and then center that line by pressing Ctrl+E, the Center command key-
board shortcut.
296
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

Unlinking the image from the surrounding text
Most images stay with the text that they’re near. When you edit text, the
image shuffles up or down on the page to be near the original text it was
placed in. When you want an image not to move with the text, you need to
follow these steps:
1. Click to select the image.
2. From the Format tab, in the Arrange group, choose Text Wrapping➪
More Layout Options.
The Advanced Layout dialog box appears.
3. Choose the Picture Position tab.
4. From the Horizontal area, choose Absolute Position.
5. Choose Page from the To the Right Of drop-down list.
6. From the Vertical area, choose Absolute Position.
7. Select Page from the Below drop-down list.
8. Click OK.
This trick works best (but not exclusively) with objects placed behind your
text. It makes the graphic or image appear to be part of the paper. (To further
the effect, I recommend using very light colors or “washing out” any picture
framed in an AutoShape.)
Image Editing
Just as people edit their text, you’ll wind up editing images you put into your
documents. Word comes with a host of tools for manipulating images, orga-
nizing drawings, adding special effects, and performing other fancy stunts
for working with graphics. Indeed, a whole book could be written on the
possibilities alone. But this is primarily a word processing book, so this
section explores only some of the more common things you can do with
graphics in Word.
When you’re using a Document Theme, theme effects are automatically
applied to any graphic inserted into your document. Refer to Chapter 17 for
more information on themes.
297
Chapter 23: Going Graphical

Changing an image’s size
Resizing an image is cinchy:
1. Click to select the image.
The image grows handles, as shown in Figure 23-3.
2. Press and hold the Shift key.
3. Use the mouse to drag one of the image’s four corner handles inward
or outward to make the image proportionally smaller or larger.
4. Release the Shift key.
Holding down the Shift key keeps the image proportional. Otherwise, you’re
changing the image’s dimensions when you resize, which distorts the image.
 You can use either Shift key on the keyboard.
 When you would rather not keep the image proportional, you can grab
any handle to resize the image in that direction. For example, grab the
top handle and drag up or down to make the image taller or shorter.
Cropping an image
In graphics lingo, cropping works like taking a pair of scissors to the image:
You make the image smaller, but by doing so, you eliminate some of the con-
tent, just as some angry, sullen teen would use shears to remove his cheating-
scumbag former girlfriend from a prom picture. Figure 23-4 shows an
example.

Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

To crop, click the image once to select it, and then click the Crop command
button in the Size group. You’re now in cropping mode, which works much
like resizing an image. Drag one of the image’s handles inward to crop, which
slices off a side or two from the image.
I usually use the outside (left, right, top, or bottom) handles to crop. The
corner handles never crop quite the way I want them to.
After you’re done cropping, click the Crop command button again to turn off
that mode.
Rotating the image
There are two handy ways to rotate an image, or twist it ’round like it’s
Dorothy stuck in the cyclone on her way to Oz.
The easy way to rotate an image is to use the Rotate menu in the Arrange
group. From the menu, you can choose to rotate the image 90 degrees to the
left or right or to flip the image horizontally or vertically.
To freely rotate an image, use the mouse to grab the rotation handle at the
top of the image. (Refer to Figure 23-3). Drag the mouse to twist the image to
any angle.
Arranging multiple images
New images that you plunk down on a page appear one atop the other. You
don’t notice this unless two images overlap. When you’re displeased with the 
overlapping, you can change the order of an image by using the Bring to Front
and Send to Back buttons in the Arrange group.

Chapter 23: Going Graphical

To help you keep multiple images lined up, use the Align button’s menu. First
select several images by holding down the Shift key as you click each one.
Then choose an alignment option, such as Align Middle, from the Align
button’s menu to properly arrange images in a horizontal line.
To help you organize multiple images on a page, show the grid: Click the View
tab; and then, from the Show/Hide group, select Gridlines. Instantly, the page
turns into graph paper, to assist you in positioning your graphics and text.

S
ome people say that you just can’t stick a round peg into a square hole.
I’d like to inform those people that they’re just not trying hard enough.
With a large-enough hammer, industrial lubricant, and perhaps some explo-
sives, it’s possible to not only stick a round peg into a square hole, but to also
insert a round peg into just about anything — even a Word document.
Word has a slew of items clustered on the Insert tab that just don’t fit in any-
where else in the word processing spectrum. Those items have ended up here,
in this chapter, which tells you how to stick all sorts of things wonderful and
strange, odd and useful, into your document. Industrial lubricant optional.
Characters Fun and Funky
You use your computer’s keyboard to type all sorts of wonderful things in
your document. The 26 alphabet keys plus the numbers, symbols, and punc-
tuation allow you to craft any story you like using any of the several thou-
sand words available in English. But not everything you type is in English. For
those desperate times when you need more than the characters on your key-
board can produce, refer to this section.
Nonbreaking spaces and hyphens
Two unique characters in a document are the space and the dash, or hyphen.
These characters are special because Word uses either of them to wrap a line

of text: The space splits a line between two words, and the hyphen (using
hyphenation) splits a line between two word chunks.
There are times, however, when you don’t want a line to be split by a space
or a hyphen. For example, splitting a phone number is bad — you want the
phone number to stay intact. There are also times when you need two words
separated by a space to stick like glue. For those times, you need unbreakable
characters.
 To prevent the hyphen character from breaking a line, press Ctrl+
Shift+- (hyphen).
 To prevent the space character from breaking a line, press
Ctrl+Shift+spacebar.
In either case, a nonbreaking character is inserted into the text. Word doesn’t
break a line of text when you use these special characters.
Typing characters such as Ü, Ç, and Ñ
You can be boring and type deja vu or be all fancy and type déjà vu or café or
résumé. Your readers will think that you really know your stuff, but what you
really know is how to use Word’s diacritical prefix keys.
Diacritical symbols appear over certain letters in foreign languages and in for-
eign words borrowed (stolen, really) into English. To create a diacritical when
you’re typing in Word, you press a special Control-key combination. The key
combination you press somewhat represents the diacritical you need, such
as Ctrl+’ to produce a ‘ diacritical. The Ctrl-key combination is followed by
the character that needs the new “hat,” as shown in Table 24-1.

302
Part IV: Making Your Document All Fancy-Schmancy 

For example, to get an é into your document, type Ctrl+’ and then the letter E.
Uppercase E gives you É, and lowercase e gives you é. That makes sense
because the ’ (apostrophe) is essentially the character you’re adding to the
vowel.
Ctrl+’ followed by a D equals D (or ∏).
Be sure to note the difference between the apostrophe (or tick) and back tick,
or accent grave. The apostrophe (’) is next to your keyboard’s Enter key. The
back tick (`) is below the Esc key.
For the Ctrl+@, Ctrl+:, Ctrl+^, and Ctrl+~ key combinations, you also need to
press the Shift key, which is required anyway to get the @, :, ^, or ~ symbols
on your keyboard. Therefore, Ctrl+~ is really Ctrl+Shift+`. Keep that in mind.
Word’s AutoCorrect feature has been trained to know some of the special
characters. For example, when you’re typing café, Word automatically sticks
that whoopty-doop over the E.
Adding a dash of en or em
Advanced word processing humans don’t type the hyphen. They don’t mess
with the minus sign. No, they prefer to use the typesetter’s en dash or the
longer em dash.
 To produce an en dash, press Ctrl+minus.
 To produce an em dash, press Ctrl+Alt+minus.
 Minus is the - (hyphen) key on the numeric keypad.
The en dash is approximately the width of the N character. Likewise, the em
dash is the width of the M character.
Inserting special characters and symbols
The Symbol menu is nestled in the Symbol group on the Insert tab. Clicking
the Symbol command button lists some popular or recently used symbols
that you can insert into your document. Choosing a symbol from the menu
inserts that special symbol right into your text, just like you insert any other
character.
Choosing More Symbols from the Symbol menu displays the Symbol dialog
box, shown in Figure 24-1. Choose a decorative font, such as Wingdings, from
the Font menu to see strange and unusual characters. To see the gamut of
what’s possible with normal text, choose (normal text) from the Font drop-
down list. Use the Subset drop-down list to see even more symbols and such.
303
Chapter 24: Stick This in Your Document

To stick a character into your document from the Symbol dialog box, select
the symbol and click the Insert button.
You need to click the Cancel button when you’re done using the Symbol
dialog box.
 Click the Insert button once for each symbol you want inserted. When
you’re putting three Σ (sigma) symbols into your document, you must
locate that symbol on the grid and then click the Insert button three
times.
 Some symbols have shortcut keys. These appear at the bottom of the
Symbol dialog box. For example, the shortcut for the degree symbol (°)
is Ctrl+@, Space, which means to type Ctrl+@ (actually, Ctrl+Shift+2)
and then type a space. Doing so gives you the degree symbol.
 You can insert symbols by typing the symbol’s code and then pressing
the Alt+X key combination. For example, the code for Σ (sigma) is 2211:
Type 2211 in your document and then press Alt+X. The 2211 is magically
transformed into the Σ character.
Say It in WordArt
I probably don’t need to write a lot about WordArt because too many Word
users find it fun and enjoyable and they overuse the feature to death. In fact,
the only burning question you may have is “Where the heck is WordArt?”

Spice Up Your Document with a Text Box
A text box is a graphical element that contains — hold your breath, wait for 
it, wait — text. It can be used as a decorative element (called a pull quote) to
highlight a passage of text on the page, or it can be just an information box 
or an aside, such as those that litter the pages of the USA Today newspaper.
Overall, the purpose of the text box is to prevent your document from
becoming what layout artists refer to as the dreaded Great Wall of Text.
Text boxes are easily shoved into a document by following these steps:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. In the Text group, choose Text Box➪Draw Text Box.
The mouse pointer changes to a large plus sign.
3. Draw the mouse pointer in your document to create the text box.
Drag from the upper-left down and to the right to create the box, similar
to the way AutoShapes are drawn in a document, as discussed in
Chapter 23.
4. Type the text you need into the box.
Click anywhere outside of the box when you’re done typing.
After a text box is on the screen, or whenever you click the mouse to select a
text box, the Text Box Tools Format tab appears. It contains a lot of format-
ting and style commands for the text box. Most of them are similar, if not
identical to, the formatting commands used on images and graphics in Word.
Refer to Chapter 23 for details, hints and tips.
 As with most graphical things, Print Layout view is the preferred way to
deal with text boxes. In fact, they don’t even show up when you use
Draft view.
 Of course, you can always choose a pre-designed text box from the Text
Box menu. In that case Word does the formatting for you.
 You can use all your basic text-writing and -formatting skills inside the
box, just as you would type text outside the box. You can, for example,
apply a bold font and center the text, which is common for creating text
box callouts.
 You can turn text sideways inside the text box by using the Text Direction
button. Look in the Text group on the Text Box Tools Format tab.
 To delete a text box, click it with the mouse and press the Delete button
on the keyboard.

Instant Graphical Goodness
with SmartArt
Word’s SmartArt feature lets you quickly create complex graphics, charts,
and designs by selecting them from a gallery. The result is an informative
illustration for your document, something that looks like it took you hours 
to craft in some other program. Yes, SmartArt is another way you can cheat
inside Word, to make your stuff look better than it should.
The SmartArt journey works like this:
1. Click the Insert tab.
2. In the Illustrations group, click the SmartArt button.
The Choose A SmartArt Graphic dialog box appears, listing a bunch of
designs for presenting information in its center. The left side of the
dialog box categorizes things; the right side gives you a preview.
3. Choose the type of artwork you want from the center part of the
dialog box.
4. Click OK.
Immediately, an image is inserted into your document, as shown in
Figure 24-3.
5. Type to replace the [Text] .
6. Click to select the next bit of text.
You can click the mouse to select a bit of text or use the down-arrow key.

W
ord’s main job is to process words, but that’s too
fancy a description. If Word were merely a word
processor, this book would be a heck of a lot thinner! Then
again, were I to write about everything Word is capable of,
this book would be (seriously) six times thicker. And, even
if you could find a book that documents everything Word
can do, few people would bother to read the entire thing.
The depths of Word may never truly be explored. Then
again, why bother? My preference is really to get as much
from Word as anyone can. When you need those extra,
fancy-schmancy features, they’re available. And, when you
desire even more from Word, there’s the stuff I explore in
this part of the book. It’s not everything, but the chapters
that follow do cover some important things you may yet
find useful, all without wasting your time or boring you to

M
ost people I know use Word to edit one document at a time. That’s
okay. The program can do more than that, of course. You can have,
and work with, multiple documents at one time. You can view the same docu-
ment in multiple windows or on a split screen. You can edit documents cre-
ated by other word processors (if there are any others left). It’s multiple
document madness time!
Multiple Document Mania
It frustrates me to see people open and close documents in Word, bouncing
back and forth between two documents when they can just keep both docu-
ment windows open at the same time. Yea verily, in Word you can have multi-
ple documents open at once. While writing this book, I often had six different
documents open, to edit here and there, copy back and forth, and refer to
specific bits of text. It’s a highly productive way to get work done.

Don’t let Word’s multidocument mania intimidate you. Instead, use it to your
advantage. Word comes with an abundance of tools to make it easy to
manage the multiple documents and their many windows. This section
describes the details.
Managing multiple documents
Word keeps each document you create or open in its own, separate window.
The documents are all independent of each other, so what you do in one docu-
ment doesn’t affect another (unless you want it to). Rather than let this feature
make you go crazy, consider taking advantage of it. The following sections pro-
vide suggestions and tips for getting the most from multiple document mania.
Switching between documents
Each document dwells in its own Word program window. The sanest way to
switch between them is to use the Switch Windows menu on the View tab.
The menu lists up to nine open documents in Word, as shown in Figure 25-1.
To switch to another document, choose it from the menu.
When more than nine documents are open at a time, the last item on the
Switch Windows menu is the More Windows command. Choosing that item
displays the Activate dialog box, which lists all open document windows.
Select a document from the window and click OK to switch to it.
 A quick way to switch from one document window to another is to press
the Alt+Tab key combination.
 Each window also has its own button on the Windows taskbar. To switch
between windows in Word, choose the document name from a button on
the taskbar.
 Pointing the mouse at a taskbar button in Windows Vista displays a tiny
preview window detailing the document’s contents.
Figure 25-1:
The Switch
Windows
menu.
312
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

 The names on the taskbar buttons are the names you gave your docu-
ments after saving them to disk for the first time. When you see
Document displayed, that means you haven’t yet saved your stuff to
disk. Do so now! Refer to Chapter 9.
Viewing more than one document at a time
To see two or more documents displayed on the screen at the same time,
click the View tab and choose the Arrange All button. Immediately, Word
organizes all its windows, by placing them on the screen like a jigsaw puzzle.
This arrangement is fine for a few documents, but for too many, you end up
with a mess, as shown in Figure 25-2.
 Because Word doesn’t arrange minimized windows, one way to keep
multiple windows open yet arrange only two is to minimize the windows
you don’t want arranged. Then click the Arrange All button.
 Yes, the Ribbon disappears when the document window gets too small.
 Although you can see more than one document at a time, you can work
on only one at a time. The document with the highlighted title bar is
the one “on top.”
 After the windows are arranged, you can manipulate their size and change
their positions with the mouse. This is a Windows thing, not a Word thing.
 Clicking a window’s Maximize button restores the document to its
normal, full-screen view.

Chapter 25: Multiple Documents, Multiple Windows, Multiple Formats . . .

Comparing two documents side-by-side
A quick and handy way to review two separate documents is to arrange them
side by side in two separate windows and lock their scrolling so that you can
peruse both at one time. Here’s how such a trick is accomplished:
1. Have both documents open.
2. Click the View tab.
3. Choose View Side by Side.
Word instantly arranges both documents in vertical windows, with the
current document on the left and the other on the right.
When more than one document is open, you have to choose the second
one from a list.
4. Scroll either document.
Scrolling one document also scrolls the other. In this mode, you can
compare two different or similar documents.
5. When you’re done, choose View Side by Side again.
 You can disable the synchronous scrolling by clicking the Synchronous
Scrolling button.
 Also refer to Chapter 27, which discusses how to detect changes made
to a document.
Viewing the same document
in multiple windows
It’s possible in Word to show one document in two windows. I do this trick all
the time, especially with longer documents. It’s easier to have two windows
into the same document than to hop back and forth and potentially lose your
place.
To open another window displaying your document, click the View tab and
click the New Window button. No, this doesn’t create a new document;
instead, it opens a second view into the current document. You can confirm
this by noting that both windows have the same document name in their
titles — the first window suffixed with :1 and the second with :2.
Even though two windows are open, you’re still working on only one docu-
ment. The changes you make in one window are updated in the second.
Consider this trick like watching the same television show, but with two dif-
ferent cameras and TV sets.
314
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

When you don’t need the second window any more, simply close it. Actually,
you can close either window :1 or :2; it doesn’t matter. Closing the second
window merely removes that view. The document is still open and available
for editing in the other window.
 This feature is useful for cutting and pasting text or graphics between
sections of the same document, especially when you have a very long
document.
 You can even open a third window by choosing the New Window com-
mand a second time.
 Another way to view two parts of the same document is by using the old
split-screen trick. This feature is discussed . . . why, it’s right here, in the
next section.
Using the old split-screen trick
Splitting the screen allows you to view two parts of your document in the
same window. No need to bother with extra windows here: The top part of
the window shows one part of the document, and the bottom part another,
as shown in Figure 25-3. Each half of the screen scrolls individually, so
you can peruse different parts of the same document without switching
windows.
To split a window, heed these steps:
1. Click the View tab.
2. Click the Split button.
A gray bar slashes the document window from left to right. That’s where
the window splits, eventually.
3. Use the mouse to move the gray bar up or down.
4. Click the mouse to split the window.
The split falls into place.
Both document views, above or below the split, can be scrolled individually.
To edit in one half or the other, click the mouse.
To undo the split, double-click it with the mouse. Poof! It’s gone.
 When the ruler is visible, a second ruler appears just below the split.
 Just above the Show/Hide Ruler button is a tiny, black bar. Double-clicking
that bar, or dragging it downward with the mouse, is the fastest way to
split a window.

Working with Non-Word
Document Formats
When you save a document to disk, Word not only places the document’s
text into a file but also stores other information: formatting, graphics, page
layout — everything. To keep all that stuff organized, Word uses a specific
file format for your document. It’s the Word file format that makes a Word
document unique and different from other types of files you may store on
the computer’s hard drive.
Word’s document format is popular, but it’s not the only word processing
document format available. Other word processors (believe it or not) use
their own formats. Plus, some popular common file formats are designed to
make sharing documents between incompatible computers easier. Yes, Word
accepts these formats and allows you to save your stuff in those formats if
you desire to do so. This section explains everything.
Figure 25-3:
A document
split in one
window.

Part V: What Else Is Left? 

Using the Files Type drop-down list
The key to opening or saving a document in one file format or another is to
use the file type drop-down list. That list sets the file format Word uses, for
either opening a file or saving a file under a format other than Word’s stan-
dard .doc format. A version of the file type drop-down list is found in both the
Open dialog box and the Save As dialog box.
In the Open dialog box, the drop-down list is named Files of Type, although in
Windows Vista it has no name. Choosing a file type from that list directs the
Open dialog box to not only display those specific file types, but also open
them properly for editing in Word.
In the Save As dialog box, the drop-down list is named Save As Type. It lists
file formats you can use to save your document in addition to Word’s own
Word Document file type.
Loading an alien document
Choose your alien: homely ol’ E.T. or the slithery alien from Aliens? Meh — it
doesn’t really matter because Word is prepared to welcome any intruder. You
name the funky file format, and Word can most likely take its magic can
opener to the thing and see what’s inside. Here’s how:
1. Do the Open command.
2. From the Files of Type drop-down list, select the file format.
If you’re using Windows Vista, the drop-down list lacks a name; it just
says All Word Documents. Click that button to choose a format.
By choosing a specific file format, you make Word narrow the files dis-
played in the Open dialog box. Only files matching the specific file format
are shown.
If you don’t know the format, choose All Files from the drop-down list.
Word then makes its best guess.
3. Choose the file from the list.
Or, work the controls in the dialog box to find another disk drive or
folder that contains the file. Chapter 9 explains how this works in detail.
4. Click Open.
The alien file appears on-screen, ready for editing, just like any Word
document.
317
Chapter 25: Multiple Documents, Multiple Windows, Multiple Formats . . .

Well, the file may not be perfect. It may not even open. But be prepared to fix
some things or do some tidying up. Word tries its best.
 Word may display a File Conversion dialog box, allowing you to preview
how the document appears. Generally speaking, clicking the OK button
in this step is your best bet.
 The Recover Text from Any File option is great for peering into unknown
file formats, especially from antique and obscure word processing file
formats.
 Word remembers the file type! When you go to use the Open dialog
box again, it has the same file type chosen from the Files of Type drop-
down list.
 Accordingly, when you want to open a Word document after opening an
HTML document, or especially by using the Recover Text from Any File
option, you must choose Word Documents from the list. Otherwise, Word
may open documents in a manner that seems strange to you.
318
Part V: What Else Is Left? 
Saving a PDF
(oh, and XPS as well)
The PDF, or Portable Document Format, pio-
neered by Adobe and used with its common
Acrobat Reader program, is perhaps the most
common complex file format around. PDF doc-
uments are everywhere, and the Acrobat
Reader is free, which makes for a killer combi-
nation. By saving your document as a PDF file,
you ensure that folks all over the world can
read it — complete with any formatting and
graphics — just the way you want it to look.
Microsoft has also developed a file-sharing
format that it calls XPS, for XML Paper
Specification. Like PDF, it’s a file format that
anyone can read, although it’s rather new and
most likely will never be as popular as PDF.
The best way to save a document in the PDF
format is to plunk down your hard-earned cash
and buy the Adobe Acrobat Writer program. The
Writer, unlike the Reader, is used to create PDF
files. You simply print the document to the
Acrobat Writer program: Press Ctrl+P and
choose Acrobat Writer from the list of printers.
That’s the best way.
Your version of Word may sport PDF and XPS as
file formats on the Save As dialog box’s Save As
Type drop-down list. If so, great. If not, you can
contact Microsoft to obtain an add-on package
for Word 2007, one that includes the ability to
save documents in the PDF and XPS file for-
mats. The Web page link to use can be found in
the Word help system: Search for PDF or XPS
and choose the search result titled Enable
Support for Other File Formats or something
similar.

Saving a file in a horridly strange
and unnatural format
Word is quite smart when it comes to saving files to disk. For example, when
you open a WordPerfect document, Word automatically saves it back to disk
in the WordPerfect format. Ditto for any other alien file format: Whichever
format was used to open the document, Word chooses the same format for
writing the document back to disk.
The secret, as with opening files of another type, is to check the Save As Type
drop-down list in the Save As dialog box. In fact, choosing a new item from
that drop-down list is the only way to save a document in another format.
For example, if you need to save a document as a text file, choose Text Only
from the Save As Type drop-down list. Click the Save button, and your docu-
ment is saved. Ditto for the HTML or RTF format or for any other alien docu-
ment format.
Word may explain that saving the document in an alien format is, well, bad.
Whatever. Click Yes to save the document.
 You can save a document to disk by using both the Word format and
another format. First, save the file to disk as a Word document by select-
ing Word Document from the Save As Type list. Then save the file to disk
by using another format, such as Plain Text.
 Word remembers the format! If you notice that your documents aren’t
being saved to disk the way you want, the Save As Type drop-down list
is to blame! Always double-check it to ensure that you’re saving docu-
ments to disk in the proper format.
Updating older Word documents
Word 2007 easily opens documents created by older versions of Word. It even
saves them in those older Word formats, so normally nothing goes wrong.
Well, except that certain features available to Word 2007 documents, such as
Quick Styles and themes, aren’t available to files saved in older Word formats.
To fix that, you must update the older Word documents. Here’s how:
319
Chapter 25: Multiple Documents, Multiple Windows, Multiple Formats . . .

1. Use the Open dialog box to locate an older Word document.
Word is smart and displays older Word documents with special icons
representing their versions, such as the icon shown in the margin.
2. Choose the older word document.
3. Click the Open button.
The Word document opens and is displayed on the screen. And now, the
secret:
4. From the Office button, choose Convert.
The Convert command appears only when you open an older Word doc-
ument, one that can be converted into the Word 2007 document format.
A boring dialog box appears.
5. Click the OK button.
The document is updated — but you’re not done yet.
6. Save the document.
Now you’re done.

 Adding topics, subtopics, and text topics
 Promoting and demoting topics
 Rearranging topics in an outline
 Printing an outline
 Using Reading Layout mode
I
n the beginning . . . Word was a DOS program. It showed ugly text on the
screen and looked nothing like what actually got printed. Then came
Windows, and Word users beheld Normal view, which actually had no name
because it was the only way you could look at your document. Then came
Print Preview view, which changed into Print Layout view. Meanwhile, Normal
view became Draft view — probably because someone left a window open.
Today, Word offers five different ways of viewing a document. Print Layout
and Draft are covered throughout this book. Web Layout, well, that’s a wacky
view that I don’t even bother to cover in this book. That leaves Outline and
Full Screen Reading views, which are covered in this chapter.
 The views can be changed by using the command buttons in the
Document Views group on the View tab.
 Views are also controlled by the five wee little View buttons near the
right end of the status bar. Refer to Figure 1-2, over in Chapter 1.

Organize Your Thoughts
Word offers Outline view, which isn’t really used for writing as much as it’s
used for organizing things. Outline view can help you create a simple list of
items — if that’s really all you need to keep your thoughts lined up correctly —
or it can hunker down and create a fancy hierarchical list with topics and
subtopics and even pesky little sub-subtopics. This section explains the
details, which are well organized because I used Outline view to help create
them.
Entering Outline view
An outline in Word is just like any other document. The only difference is in
how Word displays the text on the screen.
To create a new outline, follow these steps:
1. Start a new, blank document.
Ctrl+N is my favorite new-blank-document keyboard shortcut.
2. Click the View tab.
3. Choose Outline from the Document Views group.
The screen changes, as shown in Figure 26-1, although the outline in the
figure is more extensive than what you probably see on your screen
now. Note the appearance of the Outlining tab, along with its various
groups and buttons.
4. You’re ready to start your outline.
Any typing you do now is really list making, or organizing information in
major topics, and then subtopics, and so on.
You can keep a document in Outline mode, if you like. I do; I keep all my book
outlines as documents in Word’s Outline view. Remember that it’s simply a
way of looking at a document.
To see the outline in Print Layout view, close the outline by clicking the Close
Outline View button.
322
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

All the outlining details are covered in the next few sections. In the meantime,
I offer some general tidbits:
 That thick, short, horizontal line marks the end of your outline. It also
appears in Draft view for the same reason.
 All Word’s basic commands work in Outline view. You can use the cursor
keys, delete text, check spelling, save, insert oddball characters, print,
and so on. Don’t worry about paragraph formatting.
 Word uses the Heading 1 through Heading 9 styles for your outline. Main
topics are formatted in Heading 1, subtopics in Heading 2, and so on.
 The Body style can also be used in an outline, mostly for making notes
and such. See the section “Adding a text topic,” later in this chapter.
Adding topics to your outline
An outline is composed of topics and subtopics. The topics are your main
ideas, with the subtopics describing the details. You should start your outline
by adding the main topics. To do so, just type them out.
Figure 26-1:
A typical
outline.
323
Chapter 26: Other Ways of Viewing a Document

In Figure 26-2, you see several topics typed out, each on a line by itself.
Pressing Enter after typing a topic produces a new gray circle, at which
you can type your next topic. This is basically using outline mode as a list
processor.
By the way, that black bar below your list simply shows you where the end of
the document is located. The bar doesn’t go away in Outline mode, so don’t
try to delete it.
 Press Enter at the end of each topic. This creates another topic at the
same level as the first topic.
 See the next section for information on creating a subtopic.
 Main topics should be short and descriptive, like in a book’s table of
contents.
 Use the Enter key to split a topic. For example, to split the topic Pins and
Needles, first delete the word and, and then with the insertion pointer
placed between the two words, press the Enter key.
 To join two topics, put the insertion pointer at the end of the first topic
and press the Delete key. (This method works just like joining two para-
graphs in a regular document.)
 It doesn’t matter whether you get the order right at first. The beauty of
creating your outline with a word processor is that you can rearrange
your topics as your ideas solidify. My advice is just to start writing
things down now and concentrate on organization later.
Demoting a topic (creating subtopics)
Outlines have several levels. Beneath topics are subtopics, and those
subtopics can have sub-subtopics. For example, your main topic may be
Food I’d Rather Not Eat, and the subtopics would be what those things 
actually are.
Figure 26-2:
Level 1
topics.
324
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

To create a subtopic, simply type your subtopic at the main topic level, but
don’t press Enter when you’re done. Instead, click the Demote command
button or press Alt+Shift+→.
Demoting a topic has these effects in Outline mode:
 The topic is shifted over one notch to the right in the outline.
 The text style changes from one heading style to the next-highest-
numbered, such as from Heading 1 to Heading 2.
 The Level item in the Outline Tools group changes to reflect the new
topic level.
 The parent topic (the one the subtopic lives in) grows a + symbol. That’s
the sign that subtopics exist.
You can continue creating subtopics by typing them and then pressing the
Enter key at the end of each subtopic. Word keeps giving you subtopics, one
for each press of the Enter key.
 You don’t really create subtopics in Word as much as you demote main
topics.
 Not only does the Level drop-down list tell you a topic’s level, but you
can also use the list to instantly promote or demote the topic to any spe-
cific level in the outline.
 Unlike when you’re creating main topics, you can get a little wordy with
your subtopics. After all, the idea here is to expand on the main topic.
 You can demote a topic several levels down without having any parent
topics. Although Word lets you do this, it’s not really best for an outline.
 According to Those Who Know Such Things, each topic must have at
least two subtopics. A single subtopic isn’t a subtopic at all. I tend to
agree with this line of thinking.
Promoting a topic
Moving a topic to the right demotes it. Likewise, you can move a topic to the
left to promote it. For example, as you work on one of your subtopics, it
grows powerful enough to be its own main-level topic. If so, promote it:
 To promote a subtopic, put the insertion pointer in the topic’s text and
click the Promote command button. You can also press Alt+Shift+←on
the keyboard.
 To instantly make any topic a main-level topic, click the Promote to
Heading 1 button.
325
Chapter 26: Other Ways of Viewing a Document

Adding a text topic
When you feel the need to break out and actually write a paragraph in your
outline, you can do so. Although it’s perfectly legit to write the paragraph on
the topic level, what you should really do is stick in a text topic by using the
Demote to Body Text button. Here’s how:
1. Press the Enter key to start a new topic.
2. Click the Demote to Body Text button.
Or, you can press Ctrl+Shift+N, the keyboard shortcut for the Normal
style.
What these steps do is change the text style to Body text, which is the
Normal style. In your outline, however, that style change allows you to write
an actual bit of text for your speech, instructions in a list, or dialogue from
your novel.
Rearranging topics
The beauty of creating an outline on a computer is that you can not only pro-
mote and demote topics, but also shuffle them around and reorganize them
as your thought process becomes more organized. To move a topic, click the
mouse so that the insertion pointer is blinking inside that topic. Then choose
one of these techniques to rearrange that topic:
 Click the Move Up button (or press Alt+Shift+↑) to move a topic up a
line.
 Click the Move Down button (or press Alt+Shift+↓) to move a topic down
a line.
The mouse can also lug topics around. The secret is to drag the topic by its
circle. When the mouse is positioned just right, the mouse pointer changes
to a four-way arrow (see the margin). I recommend using this trick only
when you’re moving topics around a short distance; dragging with the mouse
beyond the current screen can prove unwieldy.
Expanding and contracting topics
Unless you tell Word otherwise, it displays all the topics in your outline, from
top to bottom — everything. That’s fine for the details, but as your outline
grows, you may want to see just part of the picture — perhaps a grand
overview of only the main topics or just Level 2 topics. That’s done by
expanding and contracting portions of the outline.
326
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

A topic with subtopics has a plus sign in its circle. To collapse that topic
and temporarily hide the subtopics, choose the Collapse button or press
Alt+Shift+_ (underline). You can also double-click the plus sign with the
mouse to collapse a topic.
To expand a collapsed topic, choose the Expand button or press Alt+Shift++
(plus). Again, you can also click the plus sign with the mouse to expand a
collapsed topic.
Rather than expand and collapse topics all over, you can view your outline
at any level by choosing that level from the Show Level drop-down list. For
example, choose Level 2 from list so that only Level 1 and Level 2 topics are
displayed; Levels 3 and higher are hidden.
 When a topic is collapsed, you see a fuzzy line extending over the last
part of the topic text. That’s a second hint (along with the plus sign) that
the topic has subtopics and is collapsed.
327
Chapter 26: Other Ways of Viewing a Document
The outline shortcut-key summary box
I’m a keyboard freak, and I like using shortcut
keys whenever possible. You may be the same
way, in which case you’ll enjoy using the
following keyboard shortcuts when you’re
dealing with an outline:
Key Combo
What It Does
Alt+Shift+→
Demotes a topic
Alt+Shift+←
Promotes a topic
Alt+Shift+↑
Shifts a topic up one line
Alt+Shift+↓
Shifts a topic down one line
Ctrl+Shift+N
Inserts or demotes to body text
Alt+Shift+1
Displays only top topics
Alt+Shift+2
Displays first- and second-level topics
Alt+Shift+#
Displays all topics up to number #
Alt+Shift+A
Displays all topics
Alt+Shift+plus (+)
Displays all subtopics in the current topic
Alt+Shift+minus (–)
Hides all subtopics in the current topic

 To see the entire outline, choose Show All Levels from the Show Level
drop-down list.
 If you have wordy topic levels, you can direct Word to display only the
first topic line by clicking to put a check mark by the Show First Line
Only option.
 As your outline nears perfection, you can copy parts of it and paste
them into other, new documents. This method is the way some writers
create their books and novels; the document is merely a longer, more
complete version of what starts as an outline.
Printing an outline
Printing your outline works just like printing any other document in Word.
But because it’s an outline, there’s one difference: Only those topics visible in
your outline are printed.
For example, if you want to print only the first two levels of your outline,
choose Level 2 from the Show Level drop-down list. To print the entire out-
line, choose All Levels from the Show Level drop-down list. Whatever option
is chosen determines what is printed.
The outline isn’t printed with any indents, although it’s printed using the
heading styles of each topic level.
Sit Back and Read
As a popular and common file format, Word documents crop up all over. Just
the other day, I downloaded a program from the Internet, and its instructions
were contained in a Word document. Or, maybe you receive Word documents
as e-mail attachments. Either way, Word provides a special mode for reading
documents (not editing — reading): It’s Full Screen Reading view (duh).
To switch to Full Screen Reading view, click the View tab and then the Full
Screen Reading command button. Your document then appears in a special
side-by-side page format, as shown in Figure 26-3.
Only a thin toolbar remains in Full Screen Reading mode. You can do some
things in this mode, but mostly you read.
328
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

To exit Full Screen Reading mode, choose the Close button in the upper-right
corner of the window.
 Use the gizmo in the top-center area of the screen to go from page to
page, or use the arrows that appear in the lower-right and -left corners.
 Use the PgUp or ↑key to see the previous page(s); use PgDn or ↓to see
the next page.
 By the way, Full Screen Reading mode shows your document on special
pages, customized for reading on-screen. These pages aren’t the same
ones you would see when your document is printed or when you’re
using Print Preview.
 The Home and End keys move you to the start and end of your docu-
ment, respectively.
 The View Options menu contains commands to help enlarge or reduce
text size.
 You can also use the View Options menu to view a document one page at
a time or read the document as it will be printed on the page (which is
harder to see).
 Reading Layout mode is ideal for reviewing and collaborating on docu-
ments with others. This topic is covered in Chapter 27.

In This Chapter
 Sticking comments in a document
 Highlighting text
 Finding changes in a document
 Reviewing document changes
 Tracking changes in any document you edit
W
riting is but a lonely art. For those raw times when writing becomes a
team sport, however, Word is happy to oblige with tools both offen-
sive and defensive. On the offense are commands that let others litter your
text with comments and suggestions, which may or may not be offensive. On
the defensive, Word has modes of operation that disclose any altered jot or
tittle in your text. Amazing tools these, and covered well in this chapter.
Here Are My Thoughts
Word has devised a clever way to let you insert comments or notes into a
document. The Comment command works like a combination of the old blue
pencil from copy editing days of yore and the modern sticky note. This com-
mand allows you to insert notes, suggestions, ideas, or advice into a docu-
ment without botching up the whole thing. This section explains.
 It’s best to use Print Layout view when you’re making comments.
 Folks reviewing your document can use your computer to do so, but
most likely they’ll read your document using Word on another computer.
 This section refers to commands found on the Review tab.

Adding a comment
To shove a comment into your document, follow these steps:
1. Select the chunk of text you want to comment on.
Be specific; although you may be tempted to select the entire document,
just the first few words of a longer chunk are all that’s necessary.
2. Click the Review tab.
3. Click the New Comment button from the Comments group.
Immediately, the document shrinks a tad to make room for the markup
area, on the right. Your selected text is hugged by red parentheses and
highlighted in pink. Off to the right, in the markup area, appears a com-
ment bubble, inside of which is the comment number and your initials.
4. Type your comment.
The bubble expands to contain all your comment text. Comments can be
endless, although short and to the point is best. Figure 27-1 illustrates
several comments in a document.
5. Continue reading or reviewing the document.
The comments and the markup area stay visible until you hide them,
which is covered in the next section.
Comments are best made in Print Layout view, as just described, but it’s pos-
sible to add comments in Full Screen Reading view by using the Insert
Comment button on the wee toolbar (refer to Figure 26-3).
In Draft view, comments appear highlighted and numbered in the text; to see
the actual comments, however, you must show the Reviewing pane. Click the
Reviewing Pane button to see the comments; click the button again to hide
them.
 Comments are labeled with your initials and a number.
 Comment numbers are sequential, starting with 1 for the first comment
in a document.
Figure 27-1:
Several
comments
are noted in
this text
passage.
332
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

 When new comments are inserted, the numbering changes so that the
comments are always sequential.
 When someone else reviews your document and makes comments, their
initials are used. Furthermore, their comments appear in a different
color.
 You can edit the comments the same as you edit any text in Word.
 Comment text has its own style: Comment Text. Refer to Chapter 16 for
more information on styles.
 The initials you see next to the comment are supposed to be your ini-
tials, which you entered when Word was first configured. To change the
initials, choose Word Options from the Office Button menu to display the
Word Options dialog box. Choose the Personalize category on the left
side of the window. On the right side, near the bottom, enter your user
name and initials. Click OK.
Hiding comments
There are various ways to hide comments that are made in your document.
These tricks don’t delete the comments; for that topic, refer to the section
“Deleting comments,” later in this chapter. Instead, just like a good wrinkle
cream, you can cover up the comments temporarily.
To get rid of the markup area (to the right of your document, where the com-
ments dwell), choose Balloons➪Show All Revisions Inline. Highlighted text
still appears in the document; you can point at the text with the mouse to see
a pop-up bubble with the comment. But at least the markup area is gone.
To restore the markup area, choose Balloons➪Show Revisions in Balloons.
When you want to hide the markup area as well as all the comments, choose
Show Markup➪Comments to remove the check mark next to the Comments
option.
To restore the markup area and comments in your text, choose Show
Markup➪Comments to restore the check mark.
Reviewing comments
Perusing comments is done by using two commands in the Comments group:
Choosing Next jumps to the next comment in your document.
333
Chapter 27: Working This Out Together

Choosing Previous jumps to the previous comment in your document.
To see all of a document’s comments at one time, click the Reviewing Pane
button. A special frame opens to the left of or beneath the document window,
listing all the comments in sequence for easy review. (To locate a comment
from the Reviewing pane in the document text, just click the comment with
the mouse.)
Close the Reviewing pane by clicking the Reviewing Pane button again.
Printing comments (or not)
Putting comments into your text means that Word prints them when you print
your document. Yes, this has shocked many a Word user. The key to prevent-
ing it from happening is to direct Word not to print the comments. Here’s how:
1. Summon the Print dialog box.
Press Ctrl+P or choose Print from the Office Button menu.
2. From the Print What drop-down list, choose Document.
Do not choose Document Showing Markup, which is what Word has pre-
selected for you.
3. Click the OK button to print the document.
And the document prints without comments.
The change made by these steps isn’t permanent. You must follow these
steps every time you print the document or else the comments print as well.
Deleting comments
To delete a comment, point at it and click the right mouse button. Choose
Delete Comment from the pop-up menu.

Whip Out the Yellow Highlighter
Word comes with a digital highlighter pen that lets you mark up and colorize
the text in your document without damaging your computer monitor. To
highlight your text, obey these steps:
334
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

1. Click the Home tab.
2. Click the Text Highlight button in the Font group.
The mouse pointer changes to a, well, I don’t know what it is, but the
point is that you’re now in Highlighting mode.
3. Drag the mouse over the text you want highlighted.
The text becomes highlighted — just like you can do with a highlighter
on regular paper.
4. Click the Text Highlight button again to return the mouse to normal
operation.
Or, you can press the Esc key to exit Highlighting mode.
The highlight doesn’t necessarily need to be yellow. Clicking the menu button
to the right of the Text Highlight button displays a palette of highlighter
colors for you to choose from.
To remove the highlighting from your text, you can highlight it again with the
same color, which erases it. Or, you can choose None as the highlight color
and then drag the mouse over any color of highlighted text to unhighlight.
 Highlighting is a text format. It’s not the background color, but rather its
own text format.
 You can also highlight a block of text by first marking the block and then
clicking the Highlight button that appears on the Mini Toolbar.
 The highlighted text prints, so be careful with it. If you don’t have a
color printer, highlighted text prints black on gray on your hard copy.
Look What They’ve Done to My Text, Ma
Be elated when all your critics do is stick comments in your text or use the
Highlight tool. More likely, what your enemies, uh, I mean editors will do is to
rewrite your text. Unless you’re a total brainiac or you have a very bad editor,
there’s really no way to determine which was your original text and which
was modified. That is, unless you use Word’s revision-tracking tools, as dis-
cussed in this section.
Comparing two versions 
of the same document
You have two copies of the same document: the original you created and a
duplicate that someone has modified, edited, changed, mutilated, folded, or

spindled. Assuming that both documents have different names (which is a
must under Windows), here are the steps you take to determine what has
been changed:
1. Click the Review tab.
2. From the Compare group, choose Compare➪Compare.
The Compare Documents dialog box shows up.
3. Choose your original document from the Original Document drop-down
list.
4. Choose the edited document from the Revised Document drop-down
list.
In either case, when you cannot find the original or revised document,
choose Browse to use an Open dialog box to help you hunt down the
documents.
5. Click OK.
Word compares the two documents and notes all the changes. Then it
displays a list of the changes, the compared document with changes
marked, plus the original and revised documents, laid out as shown in
Figure 27-2.
If your screen doesn’t look like Figure 27-2, choose Show Both from the
Show Source Documents menu.

Look things over! Peruse the changes made to your pristine prose by the bar-
barian interlopers. Continue with the next section for reviewing, accepting,
and rejecting tips. Here are some additional suggestions:
 The full list of changes is shown in the Summary panel to the left. Click a
change to go to that spot in the document.
 The Compared Document (middle pane) is the same as the revised
(edited) document, but with the changes noted. New text is red-
underlined. Removed text is in red strikethrough. Any text that has 
been modified has a vertical line appearing to its left.
 Your original document and the edited version appear on the right.
 Scrolling is synchronized between all three documents: original, edited,
and compared.
 Each “reviewer” is given his own color on your screen. For example, on
my screen, I see the revision marks in red. Had a second reviewer gone
over the text, those comments would appear in a second color, and so
on for other reviewers.
Reviewing the changes
It’s understood that you want to scrutinize every change made to your docu-
ment. Word makes the task easy, thanks to commands in the Changes group,
found on the Review tab. Here’s how things go:
1. Press Ctrl+Home to start at the top of the document.
Ensure that you’re looking at the compared document, not the original
or edited version (refer to the preceding section).
2. Click the Next button to locate the next change in your document.
3a. To accept the change, click the Accept button.
The change is approved, and you’re taken to the next bit of modified
text. Or:
3b. To reject the change, click the Reject button.
The change is removed from your document, and you’re taken to the
next location where text has been modified.
4. Save the final document.
When you’ve found the last change and fixed it (or not), a dialog box
explains that your quest is over. The document has been reviewed. You
should now save it to disk, by giving it a new name so that you know it’s
the result of combined efforts.
337
Chapter 27: Working This Out Together

Going through this process removes all the revision marks from your docu-
ment. If you want to re-review the revisions, you have to repeat the steps in
the preceding section for comparing two documents.
 Use the X buttons to close various task panes that are open for the
reviewing process.
 When you’re in a real hurry, you can use the drop-down menus beneath
either the Accept or Reject command button to choose either the
Accept All Changes in Document or Reject All Changes in Document
commands, respectively.
 When you goof, you can choose Edit➪Undo, just as you can undo any
other boo-boo.
 You can also right-click any revision mark to accept or reject it.
Tracking changes as you make them
Comparing documents after they’ve been edited is the defensive way to
locate changed text. A more friendly way to do things is simply to direct
your editor to activate Word’s revision-tracking feature. That way, changes
are noted on the screen as they’re made.
Turn on revision tracking by clicking the Review tab and then clicking the
Track Changes button. The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+E.
With revision tracking turned on, simply start editing the document. Any new
text you add appears in red underlining. Text you delete is colored red with
strikethrough. (Those aren’t really text attributes, but rather are Word show-
ing you which text has been messed with.
To turn off revision tracking, click the Track Changes button again.
 The only clue that you’ve properly activated revision tracking is that the
Track Changes button appears highlighted.
 It’s common for Word users not familiar with revision tracking to be frus-
trated with unexpected red-underlined text. This is simply revision
tracking, which someone has enabled. To disable it, click the Track
Changes button in the Review tab’s Tracking group.

Merrily We Mail Merge
In This Chapter
 Understanding Mail Merge
 Building the main document
 Conjuring up an address list
 Making records
 Inserting fields into the main document
 Merging (the final act)
D
espite being back here in this book’s darker chapters, Mail Merge is per-
haps one of the oldest and truest word processing abilities. The mail
comes from the ancient concept of form letters. The merge comes from com-
bining a list of names and other informative tidbits and mixing them into a fill-
in-the-blanks form letter. The result is a series of documents, each of which
appears to be painstakingly customized to a specific individual, but which in
fact were quickly created with scant effort, thanks to the power of Mail Merge.
All About Mail Merge
Mail merge is the process of taking a single letter, stirring in a list of names
and data, and combining (merging) everything into a final set of documents,
each of which is customized and nearly personal. Obviously, Mail Merge is a
useful thing, but before immersing yourself in the process, I believe that
you’ll find it useful to become familiar with the following terms:
 Main document: This is the form letter, the document that contains the
various fill-in-the-blanks places. But it starts just like any other docu-
ment in Word, complete with formatting, page numbers, or anything else
you want to add, fancy or schmancy.

 Address list: The information you use to create customized letters is
held in a type of database file — basically, a list of names and other data.
It’s those names and such that are merged with the main document to
form individual customized letters.
 Fields: These are the fill-in-the-blanks items inside the main document.
Each field represents an item from the address list, a data tidbit. The
field’s contents flow from the address list and into the main document,
where the field’s data appears (after merging). Fields are what make the
mail merge possible.
Getting these three things to work together is the essence of Mail Merge. In
Word 2007, the tools to make that happen are found on the Mailings tab. This
section explains the details.
 In Word, you can also mail-merge e-mail messages, envelopes, labels,
and lists of information — all of which are a little eccentric but still capi-
talize on the basic mail-merge formula. Whether this book covers any of
that stuff depends on my mood.
 In Word, the key to mail merging is the address list. If you plan on doing
a mail merge as part of your regular routine, you want to build an
address list that you can use over and over.
 Word can also pull in addresses and other information from lists created
in the Outlook program. This trick seems to work best when you use
special server software to help Word and Outlook sort things out. When
you cannot get Outlook and Word to share information, it’s probably
because you’re missing some other piece of software.
 Please note that Outlook isn’t the same thing as Outlook Express.
Outlook is the “Professional” e-mail and contact management program
that comes with Microsoft Office. Outlook Express is a stupid version of
Outlook that comes with every copy of Windows XP.
 The address list is actually a Microsoft Access database file. It’s possible
to use Access to create or manipulate the address list files, though I
have no idea how that would work.
Mail Merge Ho!
Doing a mail merge isn’t the easiest thing, but it’s not impossible — not like
weaving a basket out of ramen noodles. The way I see it, there are five sepa-
rate tasks you must complete:
340
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

1. Build the main document.
2. Decide which fields are needed for the main document.
3. Create the address list, or the data for the mail merge. This step involves
combining the fields into records and filling in the data.
4. Place the fields into the main document.
5. Merge the records and their fields from the address list into the main
document to create the merged documents.
This section covers each of these tasks with sequentially numbered steps —
36 of them altogether.
It’s also possible to use a Mail Merge Wizard in Word. From the Start Mail Merge
menu, choose Step By Step Mail Merge Wizard. Then use the Mail Merge task
pane to proceed through six complex and terrifying steps. Or, just chuck that
and keep reading in the next section.
Creating the main document 
(Task 1 of 5)
Mail Merge begins with a document, what I call the main document. Eventually,
it will have those fill-in-the-blanks elements, but don’t get ahead of me!
The mail-merge journey begins with a single step:
1. Create the main document.
Write all the text. Add necessary formatting and other fancy elements.
Basically, you’re just making the unchanging parts of the document now.
2. Type the fill-in-the-blanks parts in ALL CAPS.
The text you type in ALL CAPS is the text that will be replaced during
the mail merge. Try to use descriptive terms in ALL CAPS. What you
type can be replaced with any length of text, but short and vivid terms
work best. Figure 28-1 shows an example.
3. Save the main document to disk.
Continue with steps in the next section.
341
Chapter 28: Merrily We Mail Merge

The ALL CAPS thing is my idea, not Word’s. I use them as placeholders for the
fields to come, and also to determine which and how many fields I’ll need in a
document.
 The main document can be created from a new, blank document, a tem-
plate, or an existing document.
 The fill-in-the-blanks items are officially known as fields.
 The document can have as many fields as it needs. In fact, any item that
you want to change from letter to letter can be a field: the greeting, a
banal pleasantry, gossip, whatever. Anything can be changed from docu-
ment to document, but you need to specify it now.
 In addition to mail-merging fields, I inserted a PrintDate field in the docu-
ment shown in Figure 28-1. See the section “Inserting a field into your
document” in Chapter 18 for more information.
 Don’t let the simplicity of this first task lead you down the merry path;
this is the easiest step there is.
Figure 28-1:

Part V: What Else Is Left? 

Assigning fields 
(Task 2 of 5)
By building the main document first, you get a good idea of what type and
how many fields you need. The next step is to create the address list, which
contains the data that eventually is merged into the main document.
From Figure 28-1, the example shows the following as needed fields for the
main document:
 FIRST
 LAST
 DATE
 APTNUM
Each one of these fields will be collected into a group called a record. Each
record, representing a different document to be produced by the mail merge,
is what comprises the address list. But at the heart of the game, it’s the fields
that make the mail-merged document appear customized.
Here’s how to create the fields and build the structure of each record in the
address list:
4. Jot down the fields you need.
Yes, this is a non-computer step, but believe me, you need it. Make a list
of the fields you need on paper with the old-fashioned pen or pencil.
5. Click the Select Recipients button (on the Mailings tab, in the Start
Mail Merge group).
A menu drops down with several options:
• Type New List: Unless you already have a list created for mail
merging, you have to build a new one. You start with Step 6, next.
• Use Existing List: When you’ve been through this before or you
have handy a database list you want to use, this option makes the
most sense. After choosing the list from the Select Data Source
dialog box, skip cheerfully over to Step 23 in the section “Inserting
fields into the main document (Task 4 of 5).”
• Select from Outlook Contacts: Unless your PC is on a network with
the proper kind of Microsoft Server software installed, you can
forget this option.
. 
For this example, I’m assuming that you need to make up a new list.
343
Chapter 28: Merrily We Mail Merge

6. Choose Type New List.
The new Address List dialog box appears, but it’s empty. Don’t start
typing the list yet! First, you need to customize the fields shown in the
Address List dialog box, by eliminating what you don’t need and adding
what you do need.
7. Click the Customize Columns button.
A Customize Address List dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 28-2.
The dialog box is populated with a standard set of fields that Word
assumes you need in each document. When this is enough, you’re done;
skip over to Step 15. But often it’s not, so:
8. Select a field that you do not need.
Click it with your mouse.
9. Click the Delete button.
10. Click Yes in the confirmation dialog box.
The field you don’t need is gone.
11. Repeat Steps 8 through 10 for each field you don’t need.
After removing the excess fields you don’t need, the next step is to add
those fields you do need — if any.
You can also rename fields to match what you want in your document.
To do so, select the field and click the Rename button. For example, I
renamed First Name to just First; Last Name to Last; and Address
Line 1 to simply Address.
12. To add a field, click the Add button.
The teeny Add Field dialog box pops into view.
13. Type the field name and click the OK button.
Figure 28-2:
Adding and
deleting
fields are
done here.
344
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

14. Repeat Steps 12 and 13 for each new field you need in your main
document.
When you’re done, review the list. You can change the order of items by
selecting a field name and using the Move Up and Move Down buttons to
change its order — though that isn’t really vital.
15. Click OK.
You now see the customized fields appear as column headings in the
New Address List dialog box. The next step is to create the records for
the mail merge, as continued in the next section.
Here are some suggestions for field names:
 Name the field to reflect the kind of information in it; for example, Shark
Bite Location.
 No two fields can have the same name.
 Field names can contain spaces, but cannot start with a space.
 Field names can be quite long, though shorter is best.
 The following characters are forbidden in a field name: . ! ` [ ]
Building records 
(Task 3 of 5)
Continuing from the preceding section. . . .
After defining the fields you need, the next step is to complete the address
list. To do that, you create a list of records, by entering the data for each field
in each record. This happens in the New Address List dialog box, shown par-
tially filled-in in Figure 28-3. Yeah, this is all just basic data entry.
Figure 28-3:
We will
come
rejoicing,
filling in the

345
Chapter 28: Merrily We Mail Merge

Fields are columns; records are rows.
16. Type in the first field’s data.
Type the information appropriate to the field: a name, title, hair style,
favorite way to eat pork, and so on.
17. Press Tab to enter the next field.
Keep filling in the data and pressing Tab to move between fields.
18. Press Tab to start a new record.
When you press the Tab key on the last field in a record, a new record is
automatically created and added on the next line. Keep filling in data!
19. Review your work when you’re done.
You can edit any field in any record by selecting it with the mouse.
If you accidentally added a blank field at the end, click to select it and
then click the Delete Entry button. (Blank records are still processed in a
mail merge, which results in wasted paper.)
20. Click OK.
A special Save As dialog box pops up, allowing you to save your address
list to disk.
21. Type a name for the address list.
Short and descriptive names are best.
I recommend not choosing another location for the address list; use the
folder chosen for you by Word.
22. Click the Save button.
The address list is now saved to disk.
By saving the address list to disk, you can use it again, which comes in handy
for future mail-merge operations.
The next step in the mail-merge process is to stir the fields from the address
list into the main document. That’s covered in the next section.
You can return to edit the address list at any time by clicking the Edit
Recipient List button, located in the Start Mail Merge group on the Mailings
tab. In the Mail Merge Recipients dialog box, choose the Data Source file in
the lower-left corner and then click the Edit button. (If there’s an error, you
may need to close the main document.) Clicking the Edit button displays the
Edit Data Source dialog box, similar to the New Address List dialog box (refer
to Figure 28-3).
346
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

Inserting fields into the main document
(Task 4 of 5)
The final step before actual merging is to place the fields into the main docu-
ment, by replacing the ALL CAPS placeholders you inserted earlier. Continue
from the preceding section:
23. Return to the main document (if necessary).
24. Select an ALL CAPS text of a field placeholder in the main document.
Or, you can simply stick the insertion pointer where you want a field to
appear.
25. Use the Insert Merge Field menu to stick the proper field in the
document.
Clicking the Insert Merge Field command button displays a menu of
fields according to the address list associated with the main document.
Choose the proper field to insert into your text.
For example, if you’re replacing the text FIRST in your document with a
First field, choose it from the list. The field is inserted into your docu-
ment and replaces the ALL CAPS text.
26. Continue adding fields until the document is complete.
Repeat Steps 24 and 25 as necessary to stick all the fields in your
document.
When you’re done, you have a standard Word document, but one that’s also
associated with an address list from which certain fields are used to help fill
in and complete the document. Actual merging happens with the next step,
as continued in the following section.
 Fields appear with double angle brackets around their names, such as
<<Name>>.
 To delete an unwanted field, select it with the mouse and press the
Delete key.
 A tad bit of editing may be required after inserting the field. I typically
have to add a space, comma, colon, or whatever after fields as Word
inserts them.
 If the Insert Merge field button isn’t available, you’ve lost the association
between your main document and the address list. To reattach the
address list, choose Select Recipients➪Use Existing List. Use the Select
Data Source dialog box to choose your address list. Then you can start
inserting fields.
347
Chapter 28: Merrily We Mail Merge

Merging it all together
(Last task)
With the merge fields inserted into the main document and the address list
standing by, you’re ready to merge away! Next to creating the main docu-
ment, this is the simplest part of all this mail-merging nonsense:
27. Save the main document.
Clicking the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar does this step
best.
28. Click the Preview Results command button (on the Mailings tab, in the
Preview Results group).
The fields in the main document vanish! They’re replaced by information
from the first record in the address list. What you see on the screen is
how the first customized mail-merge letter appears. Hopefully, every-
thing looks spiffy.
29. Peruse the records.
Review each of the merged documents to ensure that everything looks
right. Use the record-browsing buttons in the Preview Results group to
move forward or backward through the records. You want to look for the
following things:
• Formatting mistakes, such as text that obviously looks pasted in or
not part of the surrounding text
• Punctuation errors and missing commas and periods
• Missing spaces between and around fields
• Double fields or unwanted fields, which happen when you believe
that you’ve deleted a field but didn’t
• Awkward text layout, strange line breaks, or margins caused by
missing or long fields
To fix any boo-boos, you must leave Preview mode and then go back and
reedit the main document.
30. Click the Preview Results command button again to exit Preview
mode.
You’re now ready to perform the actual merge.
348
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

31. Click the Finish & Merge button to display its menu.
The Finish & Merge button’s menu lists three options for completing the
mail merge:
• Print Documents: This is the obvious choice in most cases: The
documents have been previewed, and they’re ready to go. If the
printer is all set up, choosing this option prints your documents
and completes the process.
• Edit Individual Documents: This choice creates a new Word docu-
ment, one containing all the merged documents one after the other.
This option is ideal for long mail merges that may screw up when
printing; it’s easier to print from the merged documents than to
repeat the steps in this section.
• Send E-mail Messages: This option frightens me, so I’ve never
chosen it.
32. Choose an option from the Finish & Merge button’s menu.
A dialog box appears from which you can choose which records to save
or print (or e-mail).
33. Click the All button to print or save everything.
Or, make whichever choice you feel is best for your needs.
34. Click OK.
35a. If you’ve chosen to print your documents, click OK in the Print dialog
box to print them.
Or, make whatever settings you need in the Print dialog box, and then
click OK to print your merged documents.
35b. If you’ve chosen to save your documents, choose Save As from the
Office Button’s menu.
The merged documents appear all together in a single document created
by the mail merge. (This isn’t the same as the main document — it’s a
new document.) You can also edit the document, print it, or do what-
have-you, but it’s more important to save it in this step.
35c. If you’ve chosen to e-mail the documents, hey, Bud — you’re on your
own. Good luck.
And don’t forget about your ISP’s anti-spamming rules.
36. Tidy up.
Save and close the main document plus any other open documents or
windows lurking about. You’re done.
349
Chapter 28: Merrily We Mail Merge

Now you know how to get those custom, uniquely crafted documents out to
the jokers who actually think that you took the time to compose a personal
letter. Ha! Mail Merge fools them all!
 When you choose to merge to individual documents, each is contained
within a section break inside a larger document.
 Always examine the results of the merge. Some things may not fit prop-
erly, and some editing will no doubt be required.

Chapter 29
Labels of Love
In This Chapter
 Understanding labels
 Printing a sheet of identical labels
 Merging an address list onto mail labels
 Adding graphics to your labels
W
ord has the interesting ability to print out sheets of labels. They can be
all the same label or be labels produced as the result of a mail-merge
operation. This works because the labels are, at their core, merely cells in a
table and, unlike most 12-year-olds, Word has no problem setting a table.
Normally, I wouldn’t write about labels, but over the years I’ve received lots
of fan mail regarding Word’s ability to print labels. Therefore, way back here
in the shadowy part of the book, I offer you a chapter on Word and its label-
making abilities.
The Label Thing
Word isn’t a label-making program. Although it has the ability to produce
labels, as shown in the sections that follow, it’s not your best choice. I highly
recommend that if you plan on printing labels, you get a label-design pro-
gram, one specifically geared to print labels — perhaps even some type of
database program that lets you manage simple lists as well. That said:
Word prints on labels just as it prints on any sheet of paper. Basically, Word
puts a table on the page, with each cell the same size as the sticky labels. It
then fills the cells with information, which fits snugly on each label. When the
sheet emerges from the printer, you have a bunch of labels for your peeling-
and-sticking pleasure.

 Labels can be found wherever office supplies are sold. Labels come in
packages thin and thick, with various label layouts and designs.
 Ensure that you buy labels compatible with your printer. Laser printers
need special laser printer labels. Some inkjet printers require special,
high-quality paper to soak up the ink.
 Of all the label brands available, I recommend Avery. Its stock numbers
are standard. So, if you buy Avery stock number 5160 or something simi-
lar, your software and printer know which type of label you have and
which format it’s in.
Here’s a Sheet of Identical Labels
One of the things Word does easily and reliably is to print a sheet of identical
labels. Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Mailings tab.
2. Click the Labels button (in the Create group).
The Envelopes and Labels dialog box appears, with the Labels tab ready
for action, as shown in Figure 29-1.
3. Use the Address box to type what you want printed on the label.
Keep in mind that you have only so many lines for each label and that
each label is only so wide.
Press the Enter key at the end of each line.
Figure 29-1:
The Labels
side of the
Envelopes
and Labels
dialog box.
352
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

You can apply some simple formatting at this stage: bold, italic, underlin-
ing. If you right-click in the Address box, you can choose Font or
Paragraph from the pop-up menu to further format the label.
4. In the Print section of the Envelopes and Labels dialog box, select the
Full Page of the Same Label radio button.
5. In the Label section, choose the type of label you’re printing on.
If the stock number displayed doesn’t match up, click the sample label
to display a Label Options dialog box, from which you can choose the
proper stock number or design of your labels.
6. Click the New Document button.
By placing the labels in a new document, you can further edit them, if
you like. You can also save them to disk so that you can use the same
document in case you need to print a batch of labels again.
7. Print the labels.
Ensure that the sheet of labels is loaded into your printer, proper side up.
Use the Ctrl+P command to print the labels as you would any document.
I have a whole folder on my hard drive full of label documents I print from
time to time. For example, one document is my return address, and another
has my bank’s address. They come in quite handy.
 When you elect to save the labels to a new document, avoid the tempta-
tion to mess with the table because it’s perfectly aligned to the labels.
Also don’t adjust the page’s margins or paragraph formatting.
 You can edit the labels. Sure, they all look the same, but if you like, you
can type a few new names or other information in several of the little
boxes.
Print That Address List
Word has the ability to take a list of names and addresses and print them all, or
a selected few, on a sheet of labels. This is more of a mail-merge thing than a
true label-making ability; therefore, I highly recommend that you check out the
mail-merge process in Chapter 28 before proceeding with the following steps:
1. Start a blank, new document in Word.
2. Click the Mailings tab.
All the action in the remaining steps involves command buttons on the
Mailings tab.
3. From the Start Mail Merge button’s menu, choose Labels.
A Label Options dialog box appears.
353
Chapter 29: Labels of Love

4. Choose the product number representing the sheet of labels upon
which you’re printing.
For example, to print on a sheet of standard Avery address labels, use
Avery catalog number 5160.
5. Click OK.
Word builds a table on your document, one with cells perfectly aligned
to match the labels on the sheet you selected. (The table’s gridlines may
be hidden, but it’s still there.)
Do not edit or format the table! It’s perfect.
6. From the Select Recipients button’s menu, choose either Type New
List to create your own list of names for the labels or Use Existing List
to take advantage of lists you’ve already created.
Please refer to Chapter 28 for information on creating an address list.
Word fills in all but the first cell (label) with the <<Next Record>>
field. That field is how Word can duplicate the label layout from the first
label onto the remaining labels on the page. Before that can happen,
although, you need to build the first label.
7. Use the Insert Merge Field button to insert fields to help create and
format the first label.
Clicking the Insert Merge Field command’s menu button displays a list of
fields associated with the address list you chose in Step 6. Choose a field
from the list, such as First Name. Then type a space and insert the Last
Name field from the list. Use the fields, as well as your keyboard, to build
the first label. Figure 29-2 shows an example.
8. Check the layout.
Ensure that you have spaces between those fields that need the spaces,
and also commas and other stuff.
9. Click the Update Labels button.
Word populates the remaining cells in the table with the same fields.
This is why I had you check the layout in Step 8; if you find a mistake
now, you have to fix every dang-doodle label rather than a single label.
10. Choose the proper command from the Finish & Merge button’s menu:
To save the document and print, choose Edit Individual Documents.
To just print, choose Print Documents.
11. Select which records to print, or just keep the All option chosen in the
Merge To dialog box.
354
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

12. Save. Print. Whatever.
If you’re presented with a new document, save it to disk. You can then
use it over and over and print it any time you like.
When you’ve chosen to print the labels, click OK in the Print dialog box
to start printing. (Be sure that the printer is loaded with as many sheets
of labels as you need.)
A Label Trick with Graphics
It’s possible to add a graphical image to the mailing label. This can be done to
a sheet of labels that are all identical or when you’re merging names from an
address list. I recommend reviewing Chapter 23 on using graphics in Word
before you proceed.
To stick a graphical image into your list of labels, work through Steps 1
through 5 from the preceding section. What you do next depends on whether
you’re merging an address list or just making a sheet of identical labels.
 When you’re merging in an address list, follow Steps 6 through 8 from
the preceding section.
 When you’re creating a sheet of identical labels, simply type and format
the label you want in the table’s first cell, such as your own name and
address to be used for return address labels.
After making your label, either from an address list’s Merge fields or by just
typing plain text, you’re ready to add the graphical image: Click the Insert tab
and use the Picture button to insert the image — or use any of the techniques
covered in Chapter 23 for sticking graphics into a Word document.
Figure 29-2:
The first
label
dictates
how the

355
Chapter 29: Labels of Love

This is important! Click the image and choose Square as the text-wrapping
option. Resize and position the image so that it’s completely within the first
cell in the table, as shown in Figure 29-3.
When everything looks just right, click the Update Labels button on the
Mailings tab. This populates the entire sheet, duplicating exactly what you’ve
placed into the first cell — including graphics.
Unfortunately, because this graphical trick involves fooling Word’s mail-
merge function and before you can save or print your document, you need to
get rid of those <<Next Record>> fields. Here’s my suggestion:
1. Carefully select the text <<Next Record>>, including the angle 
brackets on either side.
You have to select the whole thing; clicking just the field turns it gray.
That’s not selecting! Drag the mouse over the entire thing to select it.
2. Press Ctrl+C to copy that text.
3. Press Ctrl+H to conjure up the Find and Replace dialog box.
4. Click the mouse in the Find What box and then press Ctrl+V to paste.
This step pastes the text <<Next Record>> into the box.
Leave the Replace With box blank.
5. Click the Replace All button.
At this point, Word may replace only the selected text. That’s fine: Click
the Yes button to continue replacing throughout the entire document.
Also click the Yes button if you’re asked to continue searching at the
beginning of the document.
Click OK when the search-and-replace operation has been completed.
6. Close the Find and Replace dialog box.
And all those annoying <<Next Record>> things are gone from the
labels.
Now your labels are ready to save and print.

W
hat you see is not what you have to put up with. Word 2007 offers
fewer chances to customize things than earlier versions of Word, but
that doesn’t mean that you utterly lack ways of modifying Word’s appear-
ance. This chapter covers a few things you can do to make Word your own,
by customizing its look and interface to match the way you use the program.
Paint an inch thick!
All the Better to See You, My Dear
Since computers went graphical some 15 years ago, just about every program
has a Zoom command. Like the zoom lens on a camera, the Zoom command
is used to make the stuff you work on appear larger or smaller. So, if you have
a difficult time seeing your document, you can zoom in. Or, to help get the big
picture, you can zoom out.
The main Zoom control is found on the status bar, as shown in Figure 30-1.
The percentage value is the approximate ratio between the size of your docu-
ment on the computer’s monitor versus how big it will be when printed.
Figure 30-1:
The Zoom
tool.

 To make the document appear larger, slide the gizmo to the right
(toward the plus sign).
 To make the document appear smaller, slide the gizmo to the left.
You can also zoom about by using the commands found in the View tab’s
Zoom group.
Clicking the Zoom button displays the Zoom dialog box, which contains
custom controls for setting document magnification, as shown in Figure 30-2.
The Whole Page command zooms out so that you can see the entire page on
the screen. The text is very tiny, but — amazingly — you can still edit (if
you’re nuts).
Like the One Page command, the Two Pages command zooms out and shows
two pages on the screen at one time. You can see more than two pages at a
time by using the Many Pages button in the Zoom dialog box. (Refer to
Figure 30-2.)
The Page Width command sets the zoom level so that you see your entire
document from its left to right margins; it’s my favorite setting.
 You can also display the Zoom dialog box by clicking the zoom percent-
age (100%) on the status bar.
 When zooming takes you too far out, your text changes to shaded
blocks, called greeking. Although it’s not keen for editing, zooming out
that far gives you a good idea of how your document looks on the page
before printing.
Figure 30-2:
The Zoom
dialog box.
358
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

 If you have a Microsoft IntelliMouse (or any other wheel mouse), you
can zoom by pressing the Ctrl key on your keyboard and rolling the
wheel up or down. Rolling up zooms in; rolling down zooms out.
The Status Bar Configuration Menu
Word’s status bar is an extremely useful strip of informative tidbits and con-
trols, lurking at the bottom of Word’s screen. Chapter 1 introduces the status
bar, but only hints at its potential. Now it’s time to reveal all: Right-clicking
the status bar produces the helpful Status Bar Configuration menu, shown in
Figure 30-3.
The Status Bar Configuration menu does two things. First, it controls what
you see on the status bar, informational tidbits as well as certain controls.
Second, it lets you turn on or off some Word features. Here are my thoughts:
 Choosing an item from the menu doesn’t cause the menu to disappear,
which is handy. To make the menu go away, click the mouse elsewhere
in Word’s window.
 The menu’s options are on when a check mark appears next to them.
Figure 30-3:
The Status
Bar Config-
uration
menu.
359
Chapter 30: Customizing Word

 The top eight items on the menu display information about your docu-
ment. You can also choose to have that information displayed on the
status bar by choosing one or more of those options.
 The options from Caps Lock down through Macro Recording are used to
turn off or on those features. (Selection Mode is the F8-key thing, as cov-
ered in Chapter 7.)
 This book doesn’t cover Word’s macros.
 The last three items on the menu control whether the View or Zoom
shortcuts appear on the status bar.
The Quick Access Toolbar
If you used Word back in the old days, you may or may not have known that
you could customize the toolbars, or even create your own. Few people did.
That may change with the new Ribbon interface. Despite the Ribbon’s
quicker nature than the toolbars of old, you may find yourself pining for cer-
tain commands that used to be immediately available on a toolbar and are
now buried deep somewhere within the Ribbon.
To satisfy your customization desperation, Word comes with the Quick
Access toolbar, which can be customized to your heart’s content. This sec-
tion explains.
Finding the toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar is preset to dwell above the Ribbon, just to the
right of the Office Button, shown in Figure 30-4. Three command buttons
reside on the toolbar: Save, Undo, and Redo. Beyond the toolbar’s curved
right end, you find its menu button, illustrated in the figure.
Save Redo
Undo
Quick Access
toolbar menu
Figure 30-4:
The Quick

360
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

Moving the toolbar
Like many creatures, the Quick Access toolbar can be found in two habita-
tions. The ocelot exists in both North and South America. The peregrine
falcon can be found in both Eastern and Western hemispheres. The Quick
Access Toolbar can be found either above or below the Ribbon.
Use the toolbar’s menu to set where it calls home. 
 Choose the Show Below the Ribbon command from the toolbar’s menu
to lodge the toolbar beneath the Ribbon.
 Choose the Show Above the Ribbon command to domicile the toolbar
back on top.
There’s no need to evict the toolbar from its top perch unless it’s growing so
many command buttons that it crowds over onto the title bar.
Adding command buttons to the toolbar
You’re free to add command buttons to the Quick Access toolbar: popular
commands you use often, commands missing from the Ribbon, or commands
that add a festive and tasteful touch to Word’s interface, ideal for those who
enjoy decorating on a budget.
There are two ways to add a command to the Quick Access toolbar. The easi-
est way is to right-click a command button on the Ribbon (or just about any-
where in Word) and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar from the shortcut
menu.
The second way to add a command to the Quick Access toolbar is to use its
menu. The top several items in the menu are common commands that most
folks would enjoy having on the Quick Access toolbar. To add a command,
simply select it from the menu.
Not all the commands in Word are listed on the Quick Access toolbar’s menu.
But that doesn’t mean that those commands are excluded. Simply choose the
More Commands item from the menu and you see the Word Options dialog
box appear, as shown in Figure 30-5. You can use the Customization area in
that dialog box to add commands to the toolbar.
361
Chapter 30: Customizing Word

When you’re done making additions, click the OK button to close the Word
Options dialog box and return to Word. There, you can view and treasure
your new Quick Access toolbar.
 Word remembers which commands you add to the toolbar. Those same
commands will be there the next time you start Word.
 Not all the commands on the Quick Access toolbar are available for use.
 Choose the All Commands item from the Choose Commands From menu
to view every possible command in Word. Sometimes, a missing com-
mand that you think could be elsewhere ends up being available in the
All Commands list.
 Some commands place buttons, and others place drop-down menus or
text boxes on the toolbar.
 When your command list gets long, consider organizing things. Use the
<Separator> item to help group similar commands. The <Separator>
appears as a vertical bar on the Quick Access toolbar.
Figure 30-5:
Adding
command to
the Quick
Access
toolbar.
362
Part V: What Else Is Left? 

 Yes, some of the items lack specific graphics on their buttons; they show
up as green spheres. And sometimes the button graphics don’t really
make any sense.
 My personal Quick Access toolbar contains these commands: Save,
Open, Close, Print Preview, Quick Print, (Separator), Undo, Redo, Edit
Header, Show/Hide, (Separator), Strikethrough, Small Caps, Subscript,
and Superscript.
Removing commands from the toolbar
The easiest way to remove a command from the Quick Access toolbar is to
right-click its button. From the pop-up menu, choose Remove from Quick
Access Toolbar.
Mass removal can also take place in the Word Options dialog box. (Refer to
Figure 30-5.) Choose a command from the right, and then click the Remove
button.
I wouldn’t recommend removing the Undo or Redo commands from the tool-
bar, unless you’ve really committed the Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y keyboard shortcuts
to memory.
Restoring the Quick Access toolbar
Clicking the Reset button in the Customization portion of the Word Options
dialog box, as shown in Figure 30-5, restores the Quick Access toolbar to the
standard way it comes with Word. After you click Reset, you see a confirma-
tion dialog box: Click Yes to restore the toolbar as it once was.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Guinness folks list only the world’s records, which
is an extensive list but with only one item in each
category. That’s a list of one. My grandmother loved
to say that things come in threes. When you’re listing
mystical things, however, seven seems to be the key
number, as in the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
Ancient pantheons came in twelves, a six-pack each
of male and female gods. I prefer lists of tens, such as
the Ten Commandments. Ten is handy because humans
carry around their own list of ten: ten fingers! It’s also
very trendy in that the Roman numeral for ten is X.
At this point in the book, I present The Part of Tens. Each
chapter that follows contains a list of ten items, all related
to some aspect of Word. It’s my way of drawing this fat,
fact-filled book to a fun and fancy finish.

Chapter 31
The Ten Commandments of Word
In This Chapter
 Thou shalt remember to save thy work
 Thou shalt not use spaces unnecessarily
 Thou shalt not press Enter at the end of each line
 Thou shalt not neglect thy keyboard
 Thou shalt not manually number thy pages
 Thou shalt not use the Enter key to start a new page
 Thou shalt not press OK too quickly
 Thou shalt not forget thy Undo command
 Honor thy printer
 Thou shalt have multiple document windows before thee
D
espite this book’s girth, there are still some very simple rules I would
recommend to anyone using a word processor. These rules are nothing
new; even the biblical Ten Commandments include basic moral codes
embraced by most civilizations. So, despite being written about elsewhere
in this book, these rules are worth repeating. I call them my Ten
Commandments of Word.
Thou Shalt Remember to Save Thy Work
Save! Save! Save! Always save your stuff. Whenever your mind wanders, have
your fingers wander to the Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut. Savest thy work.

Thou Shalt Not Use More Than
One Space
Generally speaking, you should never find more than one space anywhere in
a Word document. The sign of two or more spaces in a row is a desperate cry
for a tab. Use single spaces to separate words and sentences. Use tabs to
indent or to align text on a tab stop.
 Refer to Chapter 13 on setting tabs.
 Refer to Chapter 20 for creating tables, which is a great way to organize
information into rows and columns.
Thou Shalt Not Press Enter
at the End of Each Line
Word automatically wraps your text. As you type and your text approaches
the right margin, the words are automatically advanced to the next line.
Therefore, there’s no need to press the Enter key unless you want to start
a new paragraph.
 For one-line paragraphs, pressing the Enter key at the end of the line
is okay.
 When you don’t want to start a new paragraph but need to start a new
line, use Shift+Enter, the soft return command.
Thou Shalt Not Neglect Thy Keyboard
Word is Windows. Windows is a graphical operating system. Graphics means
using the mouse. So, although you can get lots done with the mouse, some
things in Word are done faster by using the keyboard.
For example, when I’m working on several documents at once, I switch
between them with Alt+Tab. Stab the Ctrl+S key combo to quickly save a doc-
ument. Ctrl+P to print works better than fumbling for the mouse. You don’t
have to learn all the keyboard commands, but knowing those few outlined in
this book helps.
368
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Thou Shalt Not Manually
Number Thy Pages
Word has an automatic page-numbering command. Refer to the section in
Chapter 14 that talks about where to stick the page number.
Thou Shalt Not Use the Enter Key
to Start a New Page
When you need to start text at the top of a new page, you use the manual
page break command. The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Enter. That’s the best
and most proper way to start a new page. Also see Chapter 14.
The worst way to start a new page is to brazenly press the Enter key a couple
of dozen times. Although that may look okay, it doesn’t guarantee you any-
thing; as you continue to edit your document, the page break moves back
and forth and ends up looking ugly.
Thou Shalt Not Click OK Too Quickly
Word has many Yes/No/OK-type questions. If you click OK or Yes without
thinking about it (or press Enter accidentally), you can delete text, delete
files, or perform a bad replace operation without meaning to. Always read
your screen before you click OK.
Some dialog boxes have a Close button rather than an OK button. These but-
tons are typically used when you make some choice or reset some option and
you don’t want to continue with the command. For example, you can change
printers in the Print dialog box and then click the Close button to continue
without printing.
Thou Shalt Not Forget
Thy Undo Command
Just about anything that happens in Word can be undone by choosing the
Undo command from the Quick Access toolbar or pressing the popular and
common keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z.
369
Chapter 31: The Ten Commandments of Word

Honor Thy Printer
The biggest printing problem anyone has is telling Word to print something
when the printer isn’t on. Verify that your printer is on, healthy, and ready to
print before you tell Word to print something.
Never (or at least try not to) keep using the Print command over and over
when a document doesn’t print. Word tries to print once every time you use
the Print command. Somewhere and sometime, those documents will print,
unless you do something about it.
Thou Shalt Have Multiple Document
Windows Before Thee
In Word, as in most Windows applications, you can work on more than one
document at the same time. In fact, you can have as many document windows
open as you can stand (or until the computer runs out of memory). Word even
lets you view a single document in multiple windows. Refer to Chapter 25 to
see how things are done.
 You don’t have to close one document to open and view another
document.
 You don’t have to quit Word to run another program either. In Windows,
you can run multiple programs at a time. So don’t quit Word when you
plan on starting it again in just a little while.

hen it comes down to it, just about everything that Word does can be
considered a cool trick. I still marvel at word wrap, or how you can
change margins after a document is written and all the text instantly jiggles
into place. Everything in this book could be considered a cool trick, but
when it came down to the wire, I found ten cool tricks not really mentioned
anywhere else and stuck them in this chapter.
Automatic Save with AutoRecover
Word’s AutoRecover feature will save your butt someday. What AutoSave
does is to periodically save your document, even when you neglect to. That
way, in the event of a computer crash, Word recovers your document from a
safety copy that it has secretly made for you. That’s a blessing.
Ensure that AutoSave is activated: From the Office Button menu, choose
Word Options. In the Word Options dialog box, choose Save on the left. On
the right side of the window, ensure that there’s a check mark by the item
Save AutoRecover Information Every 10 Minutes. Click OK to close the
window. Whew! You’re safe.

Most of the time, you never notice AutoRecover. But when there’s a computer
crash and you restart Word, you see a Document Recovery task pane dis-
played that lists any files you didn’t save before the crash. To recover a docu-
ment, point the mouse at the document name. Use the menu button that’s
displayed to open and recover the document.
 If the power is unstable at your home or office, enter 5, 3, 2, or even 1
minute as the AutoRecover backup interval.
 The best way to avoid accidentally losing your stuff is to save now and
save often!
Keyboard Power!
Windows and its programs, including Word, reside in a graphical kingdom. As
such, the mouse is your primary means of making things happen. But don’t
forget the keyboard! You can also use the keyboard in Word to do just about
anything that the mouse can do. Specifically, you can use the keyboard to
work the Ribbon interface.
Each tab on the Ribbon has its own keyboard shortcut. To see the shortcut,
you need to press one of two magical keys: Alt or F10. After you press either
key, a tiny bubble appears, telling you which key to press next to choose a
tab on the Ribbon.
After you press a tab’s shortcut key, additional shortcut keys appear for each
command or group on the tab. Sometimes one character appears as a short-
cut, and sometimes two characters appear. Either way, pressing those keys
one after the other activates the command or displays further keyboard
shortcuts.
For example, to change the page orientation to Landscape mode, you press
Alt, P, O to display the Orientation menu and then press the down arrow key
to choose Landscape. Press Enter to choose that menu item.
After you press Alt or F10 to activate keyboard control over the Ribbon,
your keyboard is used to manipulate the Ribbon, not to write text. Press
the Esc key to cancel this mode.
Build Your Own Fractions
Word’s AutoCorrect feature can build common fractions for you. Actually,
it doesn’t really build them as much as it pulls them from a set of existing
372
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

fraction “characters.” Sadly, there are only a few of those fraction characters.
When you need your own, specific fraction, such as 3⁄64, you can create it
this way:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+= (the equal sign).
This is the keyboard shortcut for the superscript command.
2. Type the numerator — the top part of the fraction.
For example, type 3 for 3⁄64.
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+= again to turn off superscripting.
4. Type the slash.
5. Press Ctrl+= to turn on subscripting.
6. Type the denominator — the bottom part of the fraction.
7. Press Ctrl+= to turn off subscripting.
There’s your fraction.
Electronic Bookmarks
Word allows you to stick electronic bookmarks into your document. They not
only help you set your place in a document, but they also can be used to flag
specific tidbits of text for other commands, such as Go To, or the Browse but-
tons. Bookmarks can prove quite handy — better than trying to use the Find
command to locate stuff in your text.
To set a bookmark in your document, observe these steps:
1. Put the insertion pointer where you want to place the bookmark.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Click the Bookmark button in the Links group.
The Bookmark dialog box opens, listing any current bookmarks but also
allowing you to create a new bookmark.
4. Type a name for the bookmark.
Be clever! The name reminds you of where you are in your document,
but it cannot contain spaces. (Use underlines rather than spaces.)
5. Press Enter or click the Add button.
You don’t see anything on the screen, but the bookmark is there, invisi-
bly lurking in your text.
373
Chapter 32: Ten Cool Tricks

Of course, bookmarks mean nothing unless there’s a way to find them. That’s
where the Go To command comes in handy:
To jump to a bookmark anywhere in a document, press the F5 key. It summons
the Go To tab in the Find and Replace dialog box. Choose Bookmark from the
Go To What list, and then select a bookmark name from the drop-down list on
the right side of the dialog box. Click the Go To button to visit that bookmark’s
location. (Close the Find and Replace dialog box when you’re done with it.)
Document Inspection
Stories in the media a few years ago disclosed that the typical Word document
contains more than just the text you see on the screen. Occasionally, some per-
sonal data would slip out with a Word document, allowing anyone reading it to
trace that document back to whoever wrote it or at least figure out on which
computer it was written. Some people consider this a security flaw. I agree!
To help protect your document from snooping eyes, you can perform a
Document Inspection. Here’s what I do:
1. Save your document to disk.
Do this step a final time before inspecting. And, yes, this step assumes
that your document has already been written.
2. From the Office Button menu, choose Prepare➪Inspect Document.
Mr. Document Inspector appears, listing suspicious things it looks for
inside a document.
3. Click the Inspect button.
Any suspect items found in your document are flagged in the Document
Inspector window. To fix the items, click the Remove All button(s).
4. Click the Reinspect button to scan your document again, if you feel
the need.
Go to Step 3 if you choose to reinspect.
5. Click the Close button.
The Drop Cap
A drop cap is the first letter of a report, article, chapter, or story that appears
in a larger and more interesting font than the other characters. Figure 32-1
shows an example.
374
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Here’s how to add a drop cap to your document:
1. Select the first character of the first word at the start of your text.
For example, select the O in “Once upon a time.”
It also helps if this paragraph is left justified and not indented with a tab
or any of the tricky formatting discussed in Part III of this book.
2. Click the Insert tab.
3. Choose a drop cap style from the Drop Cap button’s menu.
The first option, None, isn’t a drop cap at all. The Dropped style is
second, and the In Margin style is third. I prefer the Dropped style
myself. To select the style you prefer, click in that box.
The final menu option, Advanced, summons the Drop Cap dialog box,
from which you can select a font or make other, specific drop cap
adjustments.
You can undo a drop cap by clicking it and then choosing Drop Cap➪None.
Drop caps, like other fancy elements in your text, show up best in Print
Layout view.
The Document Map
The Document Map feature is there to help you see the big picture, especially
if you use Word’s heading styles. Click the View tab and put a check mark by
Document Map in the Show/Hide group. A special task pane opens to the left
side of your document, listing a quick summary of the various heading styles
used.
I find the Document Map useful in getting a quick overview of how my docu-
ment is structured. Also, by clicking a heading inside the map, you can
instantly jump to that part of your document.
Figure 32-1:
A drop cap.
375
Chapter 32: Ten Cool Tricks

Remove the check mark by Document Map to close that special view of your
document.
Add an Envelope to Your letter
A quick way to print an envelope with every letter you create is to attach the
envelope to the end of the letter. After typing your letter, click the Envelopes
button in the Mailings tab. When your document already has an address in it,
Word magically locates that address and places it in the Delivery Address
box in the Envelopes and Labels dialog box. Click the Add to Document
button, and you’re done.
If Word doesn’t find the address, you can manually type it in the Envelopes
and Labels dialog box. Remember to click the Add to Document button to
return to your document.
It may not be obvious on the screen, but the first page of your letter is now
an envelope. When you’re ready to print the letter, the envelope is printed
first and then the letter. All you have to do is stuff the letter into the envelope
and seal it and then apply the ever-increasing postage.
 Most printers prompt you to manually enter envelopes if that’s what
they want you to do. After doing so, you may have to press the Ready,
On-line, or Select button for the printer to continue. (My LaserJet printer
just says “Me Feed!” and, for some reason, it knows when I insert the
envelope because it just starts going!)
 Check the envelope as you insert it into your printer to ensure that you
didn’t address the backside or put the address on upside down — as so

Sort Your Text
Sorting is one of Word’s better tricks. After you understand this feature, you
go looking for places to use it. You can use the Sort command to arrange text
alphabetically or numerically. You can sort paragraphs, table rows, and
columns in cell tables and in tables created by using tabs.
Save your document before sorting. It’s just a good idea.
376
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Sorting isn’t that difficult. First, arrange what needs to be sorted into several
rows of text, such as
Arthur
Richard
Martin
Pat
Isaac
Tanya
Word sorts by the first item in each paragraph, so just select all the lines as a
block. Then click the Sort button in the Home tab’s Paragraph group. Mess
around in the Sort Text dialog box if you wish, but most of the time clicking
OK is all you need to do to sort your text alphabetically.
Text That Doesn’t Print
One of the stranger text formats is hidden text, which seems bizarre until you
discover how useful it can be. For example, rather than cut something, you
can just hide it, maybe to revive it later.
Hiding text is done by first selecting the text and then choosing the Hidden
attribute from the Font dialog box. To display the Font dialog box, click the
Dialog Box Launcher in the lower-right corner of the Font group on the Home
tab. Choose Hidden from the list of effects in the Font dialog box.
Hidden text is made invisible in your document. There’s no blank spot where
the text was; things just appear as though the text was never written. But you
can make the text show up anyway:
1. Choose Word Options from the Office Button’s menu.
2. Choose Display from the left side of the Word Options dialog box.
3. On the right side, put a check mark by Hidden Text.
Completing these steps allows hidden text to appear with a dotted underline
in your document. Ta-da! You can see the hidden text.
Hidden text normally doesn’t print. You can direct Word to print it. Simply
repeat these steps for showing hidden text, except in Step 3 choose Print
Hidden Text from the Printing Options area.

I
f Word were only about word processing, this book would have been
over by Chapter 18. Fully half the book talks about things I would
consider to be along the lines of desktop publishing or even graphics,
tasks that can be done far better with other applications. But beyond
those strange abilities are things I consider even more strange and unusual.
Welcome to the Twilight Zone, the chapter where I list ten of the oddest
things I’ve found in Word.
Equations
Here’s a feature that everyone needs, as long as everyone graduated from col-
lege with a degree in astrophysics or mathematics. It’s Word’s Equation tools,
which you need whenever you’re desperate to stick a polynomial equation
into your document and don’t want to go through the tedium of building the
thing yourself.

You can pluck a pre-made equation from the Insert tab’s Equation button
menu, providing that the equation you need is shown there. Otherwise just
click the button by itself (not the menu triangle) and two things happen.
First, an equation control is inserted into your document at the insertion
pointer’s location. Second, the Equation Tools Design tab appears on the
ribbon, shown in Figure 33-1. Creating equations was never easier! Well,
creating them is easy, but knowing what they mean is a different story
altogether.
No, Word won’t solve the equation.
Math
Equations are merely graphical decorations in your text. But when you really
want Word to do math for you, it can — not the “Taylor series expansion of e
to the x” type of equations, although some simple math isn’t beyond Word’s
reach.
Word’s math is primarily done in tables, and it’s basically a subset of some
simple math formulas found in Excel worksheets. After creating a table, click
the Table Tools Layout tab and locate the Formula button in the Data group.
Clicking that button displays a Formula dialog box, from which you can paste
into the table various functions that do interesting things with numbers in
the table.
For example, to calculate the total of a column of numbers, click in the
bottom cell in that column, choose the Formula command, and insert
the =SUM(ABOVE) function. Word automatically calculates the total. If the
values change, right-click in the cell and choose Update Field from the pop-
up menu.

Somewhere
in here is
the formula
for artificial
gravity.

Document Defense Options
There are several places in Word where you can protect your document from
being modified. The aptly named Protect Document command button on the
Review tab is one of them, as are certain commands on the Prepare submenu
on the Office button’s menu. Both these places offer tempting options that I
strongly recommend you avoid. They can lead to trouble.
Yes, there’s an advantage to protecting your document. Yes, it’s possible to
lock up anything you create with Word so that only you can open it. Don’t do
it. That’s because when (not if, but when) you lose the password or forget
how to open the locked document, you are screwed. No one can help you. Not
Microsoft. Not myself. No one. That’s why I believe it’s better just not to mess
with those options.
There’s a difference between protecting a document in Office and having a
Word document flagged as read-only in Windows. Read-only in Windows is a
file attribute. It can be set or removed by using the file’s Properties dialog box:
Right-click the file icon and choose Properties from the pop-up menu. That’s
not the same as protecting a document in Word, which cannot be so easily
undone.
Hyphenation
Hyphenation is an automatic feature that splits a long word at the end of a
line to make the text fit better on the page. Most people leave this feature
turned off because hyphenated words tend to slow down the pace at which
people read. However, if you want to hyphenate a document, click the Page
Layout tab, Page Setup group, and choose Hyphenation➪Automatic.
Hyphenation works best with paragraph formatting set to full justification.
Document Properties
When your company (or government agency) gets too big, there’s a need for
too much information. Word happily obliges by providing you with a sheet
full of fill-in-the-blanks goodness to tell you all about your document and
divulge whatever information you care to know about who worked on what
and for how long. It’s called the document properties.
381
Chapter 33: Ten Odd Things

To eagerly fill in any document’s properties, click the Office button and choose
Prepare➪Properties to summon the Properties task pane. Fill in information
as you see fit. The information can be used to track the document or used in
the document itself: From the Insert tab’s Text group, choose Quick Parts➪
Properties to insert various property text information tidbits into a document.
The Developer Tab
Word’s advanced, creepy features lie on a tab that’s normally hidden from
view: the Developer tab. To display the Developer tab, follow these steps:
1. Choose Word Options from the Office Button menu.
2. Choose Popular from the list on the left in the Word Options dialog box.
3. Click to put a check mark by the option labeled Show Developer Tab
in the Ribbon.
4. Click OK.
The Developer tab is aptly named; it’s best suited for those who either use
Word to develop applications, special documents, and online forms or are
hell-bent on customizing Word by using macros. A discussion of these sub-
jects is well beyond the scope of this beginner’s book.
To hide the Developer’s tab, repeat the preceding steps and remove the
check mark in Step 3.
Cross-References
The References tab sports a bunch of features that I don’t touch on in this
book, not the least of which is the Cross-Reference button in the Captions
group. The Cross Reference command allows you to insert a “Refer to
Chapter 99, Section Z” type of thing into your document. This feature works
because you absorbed excess energy from the universe during a freak light-
ning storm and now you have an IQ that would make Mr. Spock envious.
Anyway, the Cross-Reference dialog box, summoned by the Cross-Reference
command, is the place where cross-referencing happens. Page 653 has more
information about this feature.
382
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Smart Tags
The Smart Tags feature was introduced back when literally four people were
clamoring for such a feature. Fortunately, it now comes disabled in Word.
When it’s enabled, though, it underlines names, dates, places, and similar
contact information with a dotted purple line. Pointing the mouse at any text
underlined with purple dots displays a Smart Tag icon, from which you can
choose a menu full of options that work only when you have Microsoft
Outlook (not Outlook Express) on your computer and everything is config-
ured by an expert.
Enabling Smart Tags involves some clever decision-making processes in the
Word Options dialog box, in both the Advanced and Add-In areas. On the
remote chance that you’re in an office situation where Smart Tags can make a
difference in your life, odds are that the thing is already configured and ready
for you to use. Otherwise, I’ve wasted as much text as I care to on the silly
subject of Smart Tags.
Click-and-Type
A feature introduced with Word 2002, one that I don’t believe anyone ever
uses, is click-and-type. In Print Layout mode, on a blank sheet of paper, it
allows you to click the mouse anywhere on the page and type information at
that spot. Bam!
I fail to see any value in click-and-type, especially when it’s easier just to learn
basic formatting. But click-and-type may bother you when you see any of its
specialized mouse pointers displayed; thus:
That’s click-and-type in action, with the mouse pointer trying to tell you the
paragraph format to be applied when you click the mouse.
The best news about click-and-type is that you can disable it: Choose Word
Options from the Office Button menu. In the Word Options dialog box, choose
Advanced from the left side. On the right side, in the Editing Options area,
remove the check mark by Enable Click and Type. Click the OK button to rid
yourself of this nuisance.
383
Chapter 33: Ten Odd Things

Word and the Internet
Microsoft went kind of kooky in the 1990s when Bill Gates suddenly realized
that his company was behind the curve on the Internet. In response, many
Microsoft programs, including Word, suddenly started to bud various Internet
features, whether the features were relevant to the software’s original intent
or not. For example, Word has — even to this day — the ability to create Web
pages or send e-mail.
Word is a great word processor. Word is a lousy e-mail program. Word is even
worse at creating Web pages. Still, these features exist, and even more were
added in Word 2007, including the ability for Word to be used to help you
create an online Web log, or blog. Word also sports tools for collaborating
with others on the same document by using some Internet let’s-work-together
feature that’s really more a part of Microsoft Office than of Word itself.
Yes, I cover none of that stuff in this book. This book is about word processing.
If you want software for e-mail, making Web pages, using an Internet fax, creat-
ing a blog, or finding pictures of famous celebrities in compromising poses on
the Internet, you just have to look elsewhere.

just can’t let you leave this book without checking on a few things first.
Just like Mom wouldn’t let you run off to school without ensuring that you
wore a sweater (especially when she was cold) and had your books, home-
work, lunch, and money for milk, I don’t want you to leave this book without
at least ten more pieces of loving, Word-friendly advice. This chapter is where
that advice is found.
Keep Printer Paper, Toner, 
and Supplies Handy
The electronic office is a myth. Along with your word processor, you need
some real-world office supplies. Keep them stocked. Keep them handy.
 When you buy paper, buy a box.
 When you buy a toner cartridge or printer ribbon, buy two or three.
 Keep a good stock of pens, paper, staples, paper clips, and all other
office supplies handy.

386
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Get Some References
Word is a writing tool. As such, you need to be familiar with, and obey, the
grammatical rules of your language. If that language just happens to be
English, you have a big job ahead of you. Even though a dictionary and a
thesaurus are electronic parts of Word, I recommend that you keep a few
references handy:
 Strunk and White’s Elements of Style (Allyn & Bacon) is also a great book
for finding out where apostrophes and commas go.
 Any good college or university dictionary is helpful. If the bound copy
comes with a computer disc, all the better.
 Get a good thesaurus. (I love a good thesaurus. The one I use is from
1923. No electronic thesaurus I’ve seen has as many words in it.)
 Books containing common quotations, slang terms and euphemisms,
common foreign words and phrases, and similar references are also
good choices.
If you lack these books, visit the reference section of your local bookstore
and plan on investing some good money to stock up on quality references.
Keep Your Computer Files Organized
Use folders on your hard drive for storing your document files. Keep related
documents together in the same folders. Properly name your files so that you
know what’s in them.
One of the biggest problems with computers today is that millions of people
use computers who have no concept of basic computer science. You can get a
good dose from my PCs For Dummies (Wiley), but also consider taking a class
on computer basics. You’ll enjoy your computer more when you understand
how to use it.
Know a Little Windows
Along with file organization, try to make an effort to learn a bit more about
your computer, especially its operating system, Windows. For example, I
highly recommend learning how Windows can help you find files on your
computer. Unlike previous versions, Word 2007 no longer has a file searching
command; you’re expected to use Windows to do that.

Back Up Your Work
You should have two copies of everything you write, especially the stuff that
you value and treasure. There’s the original copy you keep on the computer’s
hard drive; this book tells you how to save that copy. A second copy, or
backup, should also be made, one that doesn’t live on the same disk drive as
the original. 
To back up your work, use a CD-R, DVD-R, USB thumb drive, flash drive, or
network drive. You can back up files by simply copying them in Windows,
though using a traditional backup program on a schedule is the best thing.
Refer to my book PCs For Dummies (Wiley) for more information.
Use AutoCorrect
As you work in Word, you soon discover which words you enjoy misspelling
the most. These words appear on the screen with a red zigzag underline. The
common thing to do is to right-click the word and correct it by choosing a
proper replacement from the pop-up list. I suggest that you go one step fur-
ther and choose the AutoCorrect submenu and then choose the replacement
word. With your oft-misspelled word in the AutoCorrect repertoire, you never
have to fix the misspelling again. Well, either that or just learn how to spell
the dumb word properly in the first place!
To quickly insert things you type over and over, like your name and address,
use an AutoText entry. Type your entry once, and then define it as a glossary
entry under the Edit menu. Then use the shortcut key to zap it in whenever
you need it. See Chapter 8 for more about AutoText.
Use Those Keyboard Shortcuts
You should have a repertoire of keyboard shortcuts, representing many of
the commands you use often. This book’s Cheat Sheet, inside the front cover,
lists a few, but also check in this book for shortcuts related to commands you
use often. Though it may not seem so at first, using the keyboard is much
faster than getting by with the mouse.
387
Chapter 34: Ten Avuncular Suggestions 

Try New Things
In Word, as in life, people get into habits and do things the same way over
and over. Rather than fall into that trap, consider trying new things from
time to time. For example, consider using a table rather than tabs to organize
your stuff. If you’re an ancient Word user from days gone by, try out some of
the Quick Styles or mess around with a theme. Try to explore as much of
Word as possible. You may learn a new trick or discover a faster way to get
something done.
Let Word Do the Work
Word does amazing things. In fact, any time you feel that you’re doing too
much work in Word, there’s probably an easier, faster way to get the same job
done. Use this book’s index or the Word help system to peruse the various
tasks you undertake. You may be surprised that a shortcut exists, one that
saves you time and makes your stuff look good.
Don’t Take It All Too Seriously
Computers are really about having fun. Too many people panic too quickly
when they use a computer. Don’t let it get to you! And please, please, don’t
reinstall Word to fix a minor problem. Anything that goes wrong has a solu-
tion. If the solution isn’t in this book, consult your computer guru. Someone
is bound to be able to help you out.
