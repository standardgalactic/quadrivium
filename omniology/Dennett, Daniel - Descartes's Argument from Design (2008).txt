DESCARTES'S ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN* 
It 
is not at all impossible for a philosopher 
to be driven to a convic 
tion by an argument that has never been consciously articulated, 
an argument 
the philosopher 
would have difficulty recognizing 
and might even disavow. Indeed, philosophers 
typically work back 
wards, casting about for suitably presentable 
arguments 
to support 
propositions 
they find irresistible for reasons to which they have only 
imperfect access. Tacitly recognizing 
this, there has been a distin 
guished 
tradition of second-guessing 
among 
interpreters, who try to 
impose "better" arguments on their authors than those authors ever 
dreamt of. A classic case is Jaakko Hintikka's 
"Cogito, ergo sum: Infer 
ence or Performance?"1 which argues that contrary to what Descartes 
himself seemed to be asserting in both the Discourse on Method and the 
Meditations, the force of the cogito lies in the performatory 
aspect of saying 
"I exist." The obviousness 
lies in "the existential inconsistency of the 
sentence T don't exist' and therefore the existential self-verifiability of 
T exist'" rather than on any deduction of sum from cogito. Descartes 
cer 
tainly never formulated the argument from pragmatic self-contradiction 
that Hintikka adduces, but it may indeed have fueled his confidence 
in the supreme self-evidence of sum. (Hintikka surmises that this is 
something Descartes may have "realized, albeit dimly" (ibid., p. 25).) 
And more 
important than this hard-to-ascertain 
biographical 
fact 
about Descartes, Hintikka's 
analysis may help explain why we today 
find cogito, ergo sum strangely compelling even though we cannot agree 
on a sound interpretation of it.

THE 
JOURNAL 
OF PHILOSOPHY 
I want to explore a similarly subliminal argument 
in Descartes's 
Third Meditation, 
which has always posed a problem 
for beginning 
students and their professors, but rather the opposite problem: what 
Descartes 
says there is not compelling at all. Descartes 
offers a notori 
ously unconvincing 
argument 
for the existence 
of God, based on 
nothing more 
than the fact that he, Descartes, has the particular idea 
of God 
that he has. This strikes most readers today as a desperate 
move, forced on Descartes 
by the very success of his skeptical house 
cleaning, which has left him with precious 
little in the way of raw 
materials 
from which 
to construct an argument. Having 
just im 
pressed us with his Olympian 
standards of systematic skepticism, he 
spoils the effect by endorsing a principle he seems to pull out of thin 
air: "in order for a given idea to contain such and such objective real 
ity, it must surely derive it from some cause which contains at least as 
much formal reality as there is objective reality in the idea" (AT VII, 41). 
This principle does not seem obvious 
to our "natural light." In fact, 
although 
commentators 
have written extensively about Descartes's 
concept of objective reality, they generally do not even try to explain 
how this causal principle could seem obvious to Descartes. 
How on earth could Descartes 
be persuaded 
by this transparently 
contrived and unconvincing 
exercise 
in scholasticism? We may be 
tempted to treat our dismay as simply a manifestation of the difference 
between our twenty-first century world of ideas and his seventeenth 
century world. Isn't it fascinating to see that Descartes 
and some of 
his contemporaries 
could be impressed by this sort of argument! This 
reflection leads to interesting questions 
in the history of philosophy 
but opting for that path of scholarship at the outset may conceal other 
riches from us. I will suggest that whatever 
the merits of Descartes's 
explicit argument in the Third Meditation, 
beneath 
the surface there 
is a very interesting?but 
ultimately flawed?argument 
for the exis 
tence of God 
that has at least this virtue: a confused appreciation 
of 
it could well have convinced Descartes, even if in the end it is unsound. 
This is Descartes's 
almost unspoken Argument 
from Design. 
(As we 
shall see, he does articulate all the pieces of the argument, without ever 
putting them together explicitly.) 
I. THE 
EXPLICIT 
ARGUMENT 
First let us review how the explicit argument in the Third Meditation 
actually runs. The conclusion 
carried over from the Second Medita 
tion is not just that he, the res cogitans, exists, but that his ideas, "in 
so far as they are simply modes of thinking, do exist within me?of 
that 
I am certain" (AT VII, 35). Then, after raising the issue of whether or 
not he can be certain of those of his ideas that are entirely "clear and

distinct," and deciding that in order to establish this he must first prove 
God's 
existence, and that God 
is not a deceiver, he turns to his first 
argument for the existence of God?with 
both hands 
tied behind 
his back, one might say. The complete inventory of his available prem 
ises is this: he exists, and his ideas, as modes 
of thinking, exist. That 
is all. From this he must construct a proof of God's 
existence. 
So, 
not surprisingly, he turns to his ideas, to see what can be made of them. 
They come in different varieties, he notes, and "Of course, if I consid 
ered just the ideas themselves simply as modes of my thought, without 
referring them to anything else, they could scarcely give me any mate 
rial for error" (AT VII, 38). Some of these ideas seem to be innate, 
others adventitious (coming from outside?via 
the senses, presumably) 
and still others seem to be invented by him. So long as he is merely 
talking of how these ideas seem to him, he is not "referring them to 
anything else" but just describing 
their properties simply as modes 
of 
his thought. 
"Insofar as the ideas are considered 
simply as modes 
of thought, 
there is no recognizable 
inequality among them; they all appear [my 
emphasis] 
to come from within me in the same fashion. But in so far 
as different ideas are considered as [my emphasis] 
images which repre 
sent different things, it is clear that they differ widely" (AT VII, 40). He 
is still not "referring them to anything else," but noting their differences 
in what they represent?or, one might better say, apparently represent? 
just to keep it clear that no commitment to external things has been 
made. 
In this regard, ideas differ widely; ideas representing substances, 
for instance, 
"are 
something 
more 
and, 
so to speak, 
contain 
more 
ob 
jective reality" than the ideas of accidents. And, he goes on to add, 
his idea of God has more objective reality than those ideas "by which 
finite substances are exhibited" 
(AT VII, 40). 
His idea of God, more precisely his idea of 
a supreme 
God, 
eternal, 
infinite, 
immutable, 
omniscient, 
omnipotent 
and 
the creator 
of all things 
that exist apart 
from him 
"certainly" has in it more objective reality than the ideas that repre 
sent finite 
substances. 
The 
term "objective 
reality" is generally regarded as an unfortu 
nate label for the distinction Descartes 
apparently had in mind. As 
Anthony Kenny notes, "'Objective reality,' which for Descartes 
signified 
something mental, has come by a quirk of history to be synonymous 
with 
'extramental 
existence'."2 
But 
even 
after we have 
set this awkward

THE 
JOURNAL 
OF PHILOSOPHY 
ness aside, the concept is apt to strike us as dubious. Suppose 
I have the 
idea of a sloop, a one-masted 
sailboat with two sails. Does 
the idea of a 
taw-masted sailboat contain more objective reality than that idea? Does 
the idea of the fastest sloop in the world contain more objective reality? 
Does 
the idea of a solid gold sloop larger than the sun and capable of 
exceeding 
the speed of light contain more objective reality? The mani 
fest differences between 
these ideas are indeed readily accessible 
to 
Descartes, and to us, independendy of whether they in fact refer to or 
represent anything real independent of themselves, but if this is how 
one distinguishes the objective reality of ideas, it is a dubious distinction 
indeed, especially when one sees how Descartes proposes 
to exploit it: 
"Now it is manifest by the natural light that there must be at least as 
much 
reality in the efficient and total cause as in the effect of that 
cause." And "it follows from this both that something cannot arise from 
nothing, and also that what is more perfect?that 
is, contains in itself 
more reality?cannot 
arise from what is less perfect." And, he goes on, 
this is "transparently true not only in the case of effects which possess 
what the philosophers call actual or formal reality, but also in the case of 
ideas, where one is considering only what they call objective reality." 
But 
in order 
for a given 
idea 
to contain 
such and 
such objective 
reality, it 
must 
surely derive 
it from 
some 
cause 
which 
contains 
at least as much 
formal 
reality as there 
is objective 
reality 
in the idea 
(AT VII, 
41).... 
But 
what 
is my 
conclusion 
to be? 
If the objective 
reality of any of my 
ideas 
turns out 
to be so great 
that I am sure the same 
reality does 
not reside 
in 
me, 
either 
formally 
or eminently, 
and hence 
that I myself 
cannot 
be 
its 
cause, 
it will necessarily 
follow 
that I am not alone 
in the world, 
but 
that 
some 
other 
thing which 
is the cause 
of this idea also 
exists 
(AT VII, 
42). 
In the general run of his ideas he finds "nothing in them so great or 
excellent as to make 
it seem impossible" that it originated 
in himself. 
But his idea of God 
is different; it has attributes "such that, the more 
carefully I concentrate on them, the less possible 
it seems that they 
could have originated from me alone. So from what has been said it 
must be concluded 
that God necessarily exists" (AT VII, 45). 
Later he summarizes: 
The whole force of the argument lies in this: I recognize that it would be 
impossible 
for me 
to exist with 
the kind of nature 
I have?that 
is, having 
within me 
the idea of God?were 
it not 
the case 
that God 
really existed 
(AT VII, 52). 
Even to many of his contemporaries, 
this argument was unpersua 
sive. Why did Descartes 
think his idea of God was so impressive? Why, 
for instance, could he not have made 
it up himself, cobbled out of the 
negations of the ordinary ideas of mortality, (limited) power, knowl

edge, and goodness? Descartes 
offers various responses 
to this chal 
lenge, which I confess I find utterly unconvincing. He makes 
it clear 
that he thinks his idea of God 
is different from other complex 
ideas 
that can indeed be constructed from various more modest 
ideas, but 
the grounds he gives strike me?and 
many others, including some of 
his contemporaries?as 
ad hoc and, at the very least, lacking the sort 
of overwhelming 
certainty that ought to reside in any constructive 
move 
that follows on the heels of the methodical 
skepticism of the 
first two Meditations. 
It really does not seem to require infinite in 
tellectual competence 
to frame the idea of an infinite, perfect, omnip 
otent Being?any 
more 
than to frame the idea of a perfect sailboat 
or a golden 
mountain. 
In Descartes's 
"First Set of Replies" 
to his critics?to 
Caterus, 
in 
fact?he 
responds with an interesting analogy: 
Thus 
if someone 
possesses 
in his 
intellect 
the idea 
of a machine 
of a 
highly intricate design, it is perfectly fair to ask what is the cause of this 
idea. And 
it will not be an adequate 
reply to say that the idea 
is not any 
thing outside 
the intellect 
and 
hence 
that it cannot 
be 
caused 
but can 
merely 
be conceived. 
For 
the precise 
question 
being 
raised 
is what 
is the 
cause 
of its being 
conceived. 
Nor 
will 
it suffice 
to say that the intellect 
itself is the cause 
of the idea, 
in so far as it is the cause 
of its own opera 
tions; for what 
is at issue 
is not 
this, but 
the cause of the objective intricacy 
which 
is in the idea [my emphasis]... 
and what 
applies 
to the objective 
in 
tricacy belonging to this idea also applies to the objective reality belong 
ing to the idea of God. 
Now 
admittedly 
there could 
be various 
causes 
of 
the intricacy 
contained 
in the idea of the machine. 
Perhaps 
the cause 
was a real machine 
of this design 
which 
was 
seen on some previous 
occa 
sion, 
thus producing 
an 
idea 
resembling 
the original. 
Or 
the cause 
might 
be an extensive 
knowledge 
of mechanics 
in the intellect 
of the 
person 
concerned, 
or perhaps 
a very subtle 
intelligence 
which 
enabled 
him 
to invent the idea [my emphasis] 
without 
any previous 
knowledge. 
But 
notice 
that all the intricacy which 
is to be found merely 
objectively 
in the 
idea must 
necessarily 
be found, 
either 
formally 
or eminently, 
in its cause, 
whatever 
this turns out 
to be. And 
the same must 
apply 
to the objective 
reality in the idea of God (AT VII, 104). 
Let me paraphrase, 
anachronistically, what Descartes 
is asserting 
here: if someone 
is found in possession of the blueprints for a highly 
intricate machine, 
then that person must either be a great engineer 
and the author of those blueprints, or that person must have copied? 
plagiarized?the 
design from an existing machine?or 
from somebody 
else's blueprints. You do not get highly intricate design?Intelligent 
Design!?for 
free. Although 
this machine 
analogy does not occur 
in the main 
text of the Meditations, Descartes 
does allude to it in his

THE 
JOURNAL 
OF PHILOSOPHY 
introductory Synopsis, so we can conclude 
that he had it in mind 
if 
not from the outset, at least from the time the Meditations went to press. 
He pushes the analogy further in his reply to Caterus: 
if someone 
possesses 
the idea of a machine, 
and 
contained 
in the idea 
is 
every imaginable 
intricacy of design, 
then the correct 
inference 
is plainly 
that this idea originally 
came 
from 
some 
cause 
in which 
every 
imagin 
able 
intricacy 
really did 
exist, 
even 
though 
the intricacy 
now 
has 
only 
objective 
existence 
in the idea. By the same 
token, 
since we have within 
us the idea of God, 
and 
contained 
in the idea 
is every perfection 
that can 
be thought of, the absolutely evident inference is that this idea depends 
on some 
cause 
in which 
all this perfection 
is indeed 
to be found, 
namely 
a really existing God (AT VII, 105). 
In his Principles of Philosophy published 
two years later, Descartes 
re 
peats this passage almost word for word, so it is not an aberration or a 
fluke. And 
in this subsequent version he uses a phrase that perfectly 
captures an apparent ambiguity in his thinking: "Furthermore, we can 
not have within us the idea or image of anything without there being 
somewhere, either within us or outside us, an original which contains 
in reality all the perfections belonging to the idea [my emphasis]" 
(AT VTIIA, 
12 [I, p. 199]). Are these perfections represented by the idea, or perfec 
tions of the idea s representation} 
What does it mean 
for a perfection to 
belong to an idea? 
II. WONDERFUL 
IDEAS 
OF WONDERFUL 
THINGS 
Here Descartes might be charged with making a curious mistake: con 
fusing an idea of a wonderful thing with a wonderful idea of a wonderful 
thing. The distinction can be illustrated by noting a familiar problem 
facing novelists and other artists who wish to portray genius. Suppose 
you want 
to write 
a novel 
about 
a great 
poet. 
The 
instructor 
in your 
crea 
tive writing class keeps admonishing you "show, don't tell" and in this 
instance the way to follow the advice is to exhibit some of the hero's 
great poems. But that means you will have to write some great poetry! 
Novelists have responded 
in different ways to this challenge: Vladimir 
Nabokov, 
in Pale Fire,5 tells the story of a great poet, John Shade, and 
the novel takes the form of a rambling commentary by Shade's 
execu 
tor, one Charles Kinbote, on Shade's masterpiece, Pale Fire, "a poem in 
heroic couplets, of nine hundred ninety-nine lines, divided into four 
cantos"?which 
Nabokov duly presents in its entirety. Nabokov has in 
deed composed 
a wonderful poem, embedded 
in a wonderful novel, a 
tour de force that makes Nabokov a world champion of "show, don't tell."

339 
Ian McEwan, 
in his recent novel Saturday, solves the same problem with 
less bravura: his young poet, Daisy Perowne, 
is given lines lifted (with 
grateful attribution) from excellent poems by Craig Raine.4 Philoso 
phers will be amused by another instance of the same strategy in the 
recent film, Closer, in which Julia Roberts plays a brilliant art photogra 
pher. When 
the action calls for scenes in the art gallery exhibiting her 
wonderful work, the works on the walls are some of the photographic 
portraits of philosophers 
taken by the British photographer 
Steve 
Pyke. (The unforgettable 
photo of Elizabeth Anscombe 
and Peter 
Geach 
appears 
in several shots, and Philippa Foot's portrait makes a 
brief, 
out-of-focus 
appearance.) 
Alternatively, when 
confronting your own inability to compose 
some great poetry (and your unwillingness 
to borrow from others), 
you can give up and just tell the reader how ravishingly beautiful the 
poems were, how deep, how elegant, how intricate, and you may sup 
port these claims with anecdotes 
about how the poems made 
strong 
men weep, brought jaded critics to their feet, and inspired the lives 
of all who read them. In short, you can represent the hero's poems 
as wonderful, but without having to come up with any particularly won 
derful representations 
of them yourself. Child's play. This, too, is a 
strategy?a 
dodge, 
really?with many familiar variations. Consider, 
for instance, the standard cartoonist's trick of portraying genius scien 
tists at a blackboard covered with a thicket of equations which we are to 
understand 
to be brilliant and deep, when in fact what is written on the 
blackboard 
is pseudo-impressive 
gobbledygook. That is another cheap 
way of representing something as wonderful and intricate without hav 
ing to come up with a wonderful and intricate representation of it. The 
huge difference between a wonderful 
representation of a wonderful 
thing, and a mere 
representation 
of a wonderful 
thing was brought 
home to me most dramatically at an exhibit at the Powerhouse Museum 
of Science and Design 
in Sydney Australia some years ago. On display 
in the same hall were (1) Charles Babbage's 
Difference Engine, one of 
the brilliant fore-runners of the computer and a tour de force of brass 
instrument engineering, and (2) various artists' sculptures meant 
to 
evoke, symbolize, celebrate... 
the genius of technology. The latter were 
as full of gee-whiz mechanical 
details?gears, 
wires, dials, test tubes, 
circuit boards, rocket engine cowlings and the like?as 
the Difference 
Engine, but the parts were just glued together haphazardly, 
"for ef 
fect," well-intentioned but ludicrous hodge-podges 
that did not belong 
in the same building with Babbage's 
creation.

THE 
JOURNAL 
OF PHILOSOPHY 
In this contrast, 
we now 
have 
a worthy 
candidate 
for Descartes's 
curi 
ous concept of objective reality as referring somehow to the excellence 
of the idea, rather than just the excellence 
of the object of the idea. 
Second-rate 
ideas of God 
or any other wonderful 
thing, like the 
second-rate 
representations 
of scientific genius 
created by those 
sculptors, would not rate high in objective reality. This is definitely not 
the standard interpretation.5 It is possible, however, to read one of 
Descartes's 
definitions of objective reality as supporting such a view: 
"By this I mean 
the being of the thing which is represented by an idea, 
in so far as this exists in the idea. In the same way we can talk of 'objective 
perfection' 
'objective intricacy' and so on" (AT VII, 160, my emphasis). 
And in his reply to Gassendi, Descartes 
compares his idea of God with a 
work of artistic genius: "Suppose 
there is a painting in which I observe 
so much 
skill that I judge 
that it could only have been painted by 
Apelles, and I say that the inimitable technique 
is like a kind of mark 
which Apelles 
stamped on all his pictures to distinguish 
them from 
others. The question you raise is just like asking, in this case, 'What is 
the form of this mark, and how is the stamping carried out?'" (AT VII, 
372 [p. 256]).6 
If we do not interpret objective reality as a mark of excellence 
in the 
design of the idea, Descartes's 
principle of causation 
loses all its persua 
siveness. There 
is just no reason at all to think that a second-rate rep 
resentation of something magnificent 
needs a fancier cause than a 
second-rate 
representation 
of something 
modest. 
The 
suspicion 
is, how 
ever, that even when we grant him some such reading, Descartes 
is just 
wrong about his idea of God. It seems a rather ordinary idea of an un 
deniably wonderful thing, rather than, as he thinks, a wonderful idea of 
a wonderful 
thing?an 
idea so wonderful he himself could not be its 
cause. It is not that there could not be a wonderful idea of God, but just 
that the idea Descartes 
tells us about does not seem to bear the mark of 
genius. Where 
is the "intricacy," where is the wonderfulness? We can get 
a better perspective on this if we indulge in some alternative fantasies.

Kenny briefly considers 
and rejects this reading of objective reality: "If I think about 
an ingenious 
machine, 
then my idea has 
the property 
of objective 
ingeniousness 
(AT VIII, 
11, HR 
I, 226). But of course 
it may lack the property of formal ingeniousness: 
it may be a vague and 
inaccurate 
idea of a machine 
whose workings 
I do not under 
stand. Perhaps 
Descartes 
did not sufficiently reflect on this possibility when 
he dis 
cussed our idea of God"

III. THE 
MARKS 
OF GENIUS 
Suppose we discovered a five-year-old child who, without any special 
education, 
spoke spontaneously 
in perfect sonnets. Now 
that would 
be a great marvel 
indeed, crying out for explanation. 
Or suppose 
we found a race of people who apparently had an innate knowledge 
and understanding 
of Maxwell's 
Equations. 
It would be stunning to 
discover such wonderful 
ideas already fully formed and understood. 
And 
if when we asked for an explanation, we were told, simply, that 
they inherited this talent from their parents, we would not be satisfied. 
How did their parents acquire 
this innate talent? What makes 
these 
ideas wonderful 
is not their basic ingredients?their 
expressions are 
composed 
of ordinary words and symbols in every normal person's 
vocabulary?but 
the excellent design of their construction. 
It takes 
genius to come up with the particular designs found in (good) sonnets 
or in (good) scientific equations, and if the imagined children seemed 
manifestly to lack the genius to have authored 
the ideas, some prior 
author would have to be located. (One is reminded here of the tragic 
folly of "facilitated communication" 
in which severely disabled 
chil 
dren are deemed 
to be composing meaningful 
and heart-wrenching 
messages 
thanks to the helping hands of their handlers. There is much 
controversy?though 
I do not believe 
there should be?regarding 
whether the children themselves are the authors, but there is no dis 
agreement about the underlying premise: someone of some intelligence 
is composing 
these messages; 
they are not random juxtapositions 
of 
letters. In Descartes's 
terms, there has to be as much 
formal reality 
in the cause as objective reality in the effect.) 
What, then, would be a similarly wonderful idea of God? It could be 
an idea of poetic or artistic power and beauty?of 
the sort that many 
great religious artists have claimed to derive from divine inspiration.7 
Or, presumably, 
it could be an idea of great scientific power. Some 
great scientific ideas have the sort of intricacy Descartes mentions 
in his 
discussion of the idea of a machine. Maxwell's Equations, for instance, 
1. oT = 
curl B - 
4irj, 
6E = -curl E 
c2?t 
8t 
div E = 4irp, 
div B = 0 
have various different formulations, all with the sort of impressive sur 
face intricacy that make 
them just the thing for the cartoonist to put 
on the blackboard. But other great scientific ideas are famously simple: 
E = mc2 
7 
One 
should bear 
in mind Descartes's 
tale of the dream 
that inspired his project.

THE 
JOURNAL 
OF PHILOSOPHY 
Now there are two ways of having this idea in your mind: just as a sort 
of icon, a talisman or good luck charm that does not have to be under 
stood?that 
is the second-rate way most of us have the idea in our 
minds?or 
alternatively, we could understand 
it deeply, and be able to 
use it, to see its implications, to exploit it in the development of further 
scientific theories. If we have the idea of E = mc2 in our minds in the 
latter way, I propose 
that we might say that the idea has, for us, great 
objective reality. 
Einstein's formula, for all its simplicity, is extraordinarily powerful. Part 
of its power, curiously, is that, like an excellent intricate machine, 
it need 
not be entirely 
understood 
to be used effectively. (At Fermilab a few years 
ago I asked an audience of several hundred of the world's best physicists 
to raise their hands if they understood "E = mc2" and of course all their 
hands went up, but one physicist shouted out an objection: "The experi 
mental physicists don't really understand it; only we theoretical physicists 
do!" ?to 
general applause and laughter.) One 
can be in possession of, 
and make professional use of, a wonderful idea without having a com 
plete understanding 
of it. An idea can be a thinking tool, a machine 
which one fully appreciates without being able to reconstruct oneself. 
To take the obvious example, few of us understand 
the intricacies of 
our own computers, but we are well aware of the wonderfulness of their 
design, which we can measure 
by the fruits of our efforts when using 
the 
tool. 
IV. THE 
PRESUMED 
PRODUCTIVITY 
OF DESCARTES'S 
IDEA OF GOD 
But now we can see for the first time that Descartes 
did have grounds 
for believing that his idea of God, for all its apparent simplicity, was a 
wonderful idea of a wonderful thing, an idea of tremendous objective 
reality, for he did believe, after all, that he had used that very idea and 
no other as the sole foundation for his theory of... Le Monde?the World! 
Descartes propounded 
the original TOE 
(Theory Of Everything), a pro 
totypical Grand Unified Theory, in which everything was to be explained 
(and predicted, deductively): from the orbits of the planets and the na 
ture of light to the tides, from volcanoes 
to magnets, why water forms 
into spherical drops, how fire is struck from flint, and much, much more. 
Descartes's 
theory was almost all dead wrong, of course, but what would 
you expect from a theory derived, more or less as Descartes 
insisted it 
was, from the solitary idea of an omnipotent, omniscient God? The fact 
remains that it was a huge theory, full of intricacy, remarkably self 
consistent, often fiendishly persuasive even in today's hindsight. Any idea 
that could generate such a stunning intellectual edifice would be a pro 
digiously fecund idea, and if the edifice were true in all particulars (as 
Descartes 
thought his edifice was), the fact that such an idea was to be

found in a mind would be something aching for explanation. So now we 
can explain what puzzled us at the outset: How could a great thinker like 
Descartes find his own idea of God so wonderful that he himself could 
not be its author? It is because his idea is not just made of lots of good 
parts (ideas available to everybody), and not because his idea is of a won 
derful thing?God; 
it is because his idea is (he thought) a stunningly 
well-designed engine of scientific 
discovery. 
Like Babbage's Difference Engine, 
it was not just intricate, it worked. 
V. THE 
FLAW 
IN DESCARTES's 
ARGUMENT 
FROM DESIGN 
Where 
on earth could Descartes have come across such a wonderful 
idea? Here comes the Big Step8?the only cause that could explain such 
a prodigious effect is God.9 
Now this argument is just a special case of the Argument from Design, 
a special case forced on Descartes by his starting point. "Look round 
the world," the fictional Cleanthes urges, in Hume's Dialogues concerning 
Natural Religion (1779). 'You will find it to be nothing but one great ma 
chine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines.... All these 
various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each 
other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all mean, who 
have ever contemplated them." But at the beginning of the Third Medi 
tation, Descartes has no external world to contemplate; if he is to find an 
impressive design from which to infer a Designer a posteriori, it will have 
to be an impressively designed 
idea. 
There 
is no doubt that Descartes 
considered 
the argument in the 
Third Meditation 
to be an a posteriori argument from effect to cause 
(see, for example, AT VII, 167). When 
defending his second, a priori 
argument (his version of Anselm's Ontological Argument 
in the Fifth 
Meditation), 
he says: "there are only two ways of proving the existence 
of God, one by means of his effects, and the other by means of his nature 
or essence; and since I expounded 
the first method 
to the best of my 
8Gassendi, 
as usual, had particularly 
acute 
insights into Descartes's 
presuppositions 
here, and introduces his remarks 
{op. cit.) by saying "But this is a very big step to take, 
and we must stop you here for a while 
..." and goes on to consider 
"effects produced 
by 
some skill. Although 
a house 
gets all its reality from the builder, 
the builder does not 
have this reality in himself?he 
simply takes it from some other source and passes 
it on 
to the house." 
9 In his Second 
Set of Replies, 
Descartes 
says: "You suggest that I may have derived 
the idea which gives me my representation 
of God 
from preconceived 
notions of the 
mind, 
from books, 
conversations 
with friends etc., and not from my mind 
alone. But 
there is no force in this suggestion. 
If I ask these other people 
(from whom 
I have 
allegedly got this idea) whether 
they derive 
it from themselves or from someone 
else, 
the argument 
proceeds 
in the same way as it does 
if I ask the same question 
of myself; 
my conclusions 
will always be that the original 
source of the idea is God" 
(AT VII, 
136).

ability in the Third Meditation, 
I thought that I should include the sec 
ond method 
later on" (AT VII, 120). 
The principle of inference he cites to defend 
the Big Step is the 
ancient idea of nihil ex nihih?nothing 
can come from nothing. 
The 
fact that 'there is nothing 
in the effect which was not previously 
in the 
cause, 
either 
in a similar or in a higher 
form,' 
is a primary notion which 
is as 
clear as any that we have; 
it is just the same as the common 
notion 
'Nothing 
comes from nothing' (AT VII, 135). 
This principle may indeed be "as clear as any that we have," but we 
now know that it is a mistake to rely on it in the way that Descartes does. 
This comes out more clearly in John Locke's appeal to the same princi 
ple in his own argument for the existence of an intelligent God 
(Essay 
concerning 
Human Understanding, Book IV, ch. 10, parag. 10). 
If then 
there must 
be 
something 
eternal, 
let us see what 
sort of Being 
it 
must 
be. And 
to that, it is very obvious 
to Reason, 
that it must 
necessarily 
be a cogitative Being. 
For it is as impossible 
to conceive, 
that ever bare 
incogi 
tative Matter 
should 
produce 
a thinking 
intelligent 
Being, 
as that nothing 
should 
of it self produce 
Matter. 
Let us suppose 
any parcel 
of Matter 
eter 
nal, great or small, we shall find it, in it self, able 
to produce 
nothing.... 
Mat 
ter then, by its own Strength, 
cannot 
produce 
in it self so much 
as Motion: 
the Motion 
it has, must 
also be from Eternity, 
or else be produced, 
and 
added 
to Matter 
by some other Being 
more 
powerful 
than Matter 
.... But 
let us suppose Motion 
eternal 
too: yet Matter, 
incogitativeMatterand 
Motion, 
whatever 
changes 
it might 
produce 
of Figure 
and Bulk, 
could never produce 
Thought Knowledge will still be as far beyond the Power of Motion and 
Matter 
to produce, 
as Matter 
is beyond 
the Power 
of nothing or nonentity 
to produce. 
And 
I appeal 
to everyone's 
own Thoughts, 
whether 
he cannot 
as easily 
conceive 
Matter 
produced 
by nothing, as Thought 
produced 
by 
pure Matter, 
when 
before 
there was no such thing as Thought, 
or an intel 
ligent Being 
existing.... 
So if we will suppose 
nothing 
first, or eternal: Matter 
can never begin 
to be: 
If we 
suppose 
bare Matter, 
without Motion, 
eternal: 
Motion 
can never begin 
to be: If we suppose 
only Matter 
and Motion 
first, or 
eternal: 
Thought can never begin 
to be. For 
it is impossible 
to conceive 
that 
Matter either with or without Motion could have originally in and from it 
self Sense, 
Perception 
and Knowledge, 
as is evident 
from hence, 
that then 
Sense, 
Perception, 
and Knowledge 
must 
be a property 
eternally 
inseparable 
from Matter 
and 
every Particle 
of it. 
The trouble, as Darwin showed us, is that it is conceivable, in spite of 
what Locke 
says, that Thought 
should be born of mere Matter and 
Motion, and the same objection applies to the phantom argument I have 
located in Descartes. Until Darwin came along, Descartes had a pretty 
compelling reason for believing in God. He had found some Intelligent 
Design within the confines of his own mind, and you do not get Intelligent

Design 
for free. Something pretty special has to account for it. What 
Descartes 
could not have imagined?or, 
like Hume, 
could not have 
taken seriously if he did imagine it?is 
the hypothesis 
that all this 
wonderfulness, 
all 
this design, 
can have 
a nondivine 
ultimate 
cause: 
evolution by natural selection. 
It is time to take stock. Descartes's argument for the existence of God 
in the Third Meditation 
is not compelling today, and was not compelling 
to many of Descartes's 
first critics, so we must confront the question 
of why Descartes himself was so convinced. He gives us some clues: his 
analogy with the intricate machine 
and his insistence that the existence 
of his idea of God could not be adequately explained as a mere construc 
tion out of ideas available to everyone. He does not quite articulate the 
suggested Argument from Design, but he does assemble all the pieces 
and draw attention to them. If this phantom argument had been a dimly 
appreciated part of the background of his thinking, it could have se 
cured his conviction that he was on to something. Why, though, didn't 
he articulate it? He does say that the argument in the Third Meditation 
is 
an a posteriori argument from effect to cause, but at that point in his jour 
ney into skepticism and back, he cannot yet appeal to the distal effects, 
the fruits, of his wonderful idea, but only to the proximal effects, the 
wonderfulness 
that he can discern from an examination of the idea in 
itself. If others could not share his impression of the wonderfulness of 
this idea, he was in no position, in the Third Meditation, 
to demonstrate 
what he could do with it, but he knew in his heart that he had something 
wonderful that was, as we say, beyond him. 
My conclusion, then, is that Descartes's 
argument in the Third Medi 
tation can be usefully interpreted as a special case of the Argument from 
Design. On 
this reading, Descartes's 
concept of objective reality, 
when ap 
plied to his idea of God, can be seen to be playing a role parallel to the 
Intelligent Design movement's 
concept of irreducible complexity, 
the puta 
tive signature of a creating Intelligence. The 
idea that we can just see 
the brilliance of the design of something, and deduce 
that it bespeaks 
the brilliance of a being that created it, is still, a century and a half after 
Darwin, utterly compelling to many people. But Descartes's 
almost ar 
ticulated argument, like the more often discussed versions of the Argu 
ment from Design, mistakes a failure of imagination for an insight into 
necessity. Darwin corrected that failure of imagination, pulling the rug 
out from under all forms of the Argument from Design. This leaves 
Descartes's 
second argument, in the Fifth Meditation, for another day.
