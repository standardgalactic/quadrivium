Smooth Operator
If you've ever experienced a computer
reset caused by a surge in the mains
supply then an investment in a power
ﬁlter such as Warwick Products' Supa
7 could prove worthwhile.
Rated a t 7  amps -  more than
enough for most computer systems -
the Supa 7 serves two useful purposes.
First it smooths out any voltage spikes
caused by light switches or by electric
motors i n  h e a ti n g  syste ms,
refrigerators o r  deep freezers.
Secondly the unit ﬁlters out radio
frequency interference (RH) which
can emanate from many sources.
Excluding VAT, the price is E14.95
plus 50p postage and packing.

Re-Inkarnation
Tired, old printer ribbons can be given
a new lease o f  life with M G A
Microsystems' Maclnker unit.
Whether the ribbon is made of felt,
silk, cotton or nylon, the Macinker
unit will evenly re-ink it via a unique
capillary mesh. Th e  manufacturer
claims that the use o f this unit can
extend the life of a ribbon by as much
as 40 times for only a few pence each
time it is recharged. —
Actual prices for any cartridge or
reel system can b e  supplied o n
application to MGA but typical costs
range from .E60 to i n c l u s i v e  o f

The NL-10 is dead, long live the LC-
10! A t the recent Which Computer?
Show, Star Micronics announced the
Launch of a new low-cost printer with a
higher speciﬁcation but at a lower cost
than the NL-10 that it replaces.
The new multifont LC-10 offers
printine, speeds of 120 characters per
second in draft mode and an NLQ
speed of 30 cps, six resident fonts and
seven print pitches selectable from a
comprehensive front panel.
Another desirable feature which
has been included on the new machine
is a  push feed tractor mechanism
which means that paper wastage is
kept to a minimum especially when
using short form, tear off sheets such
as address labels.
An automatic paper parking
capability removes the need to remove
and relace tractor fed paper before and
after feeding in single sheets for those
important one-off missives.
The retail price of the LC-I0 is E229
excluding VAT.

"The Show has outgrown Olympia
both in terms of ﬂoor space and the
increased number o f visitors that it
now attracts," and P C W Show
manager Mike Blackman. He then
explained, "It is a move that we have
wanted to make for some time and the
increased demand for space in 1988
means that the move has to be made
now."
The move enables Montbuild, the
Show's organisers, t o  divide th e
exhibition into three sections instead
of the usual two. The Business and

Alternative Entertainment
In the right rein? Roger Hulley grappleA
Alternative, reputedly th e  fastest
growing software house, has cast a
wider net to  trawl in the rights to
products from Piranha. Audiogenic,
Incentive and Bubble Bus.
In less than a year Alternative has
charted 30 times and,for one heady
period during the last PCW Show, it
held the top slot in the C16, Amstrad,
Spectrum a n d  consequently, th e
overall charts.
Roger Hulley, Alternative's
Managing Director, boasts, "I don't
think the public could ask for better
value. I  can see n o  reason why
products such as Trap Door or Popeye
at .C1.99 should not dominate the
charts for months to come."
Also on the Alternative menu are

Prior to the announcement, it was
whispered that Turner and Braybrook
were searching for a new publisher and
it was also rumoured that they had
already been ﬂirting with Electronic
Arts.
Although Telecomsoft have been
given the go ahead to publish. the
Hewson versus Telecomsoft dispute
will not reach a conclusion for several
months and Andrew Hewson will not
cease the ﬁght until the bitter end.

P R O G R A M M I N G  T I P S
Programming
H
ave you ever looked at a game or
read a review and thought that you
could write a chart topping game? If
so, then why not give it a go. The worst
thing that could happen is that you're
left with a game that's simply enjoyed
by your friends or you could become
the ﬁrst software millionaire!
Before we start it is important to
remember that not everyone has your
outlook on games and the market, so if
you hit a brick wall, back off and try
elsewhere. This can be a frustrating
business b u t  d o n ' t  a d d  t o  y o u r
problems by engaging in arguments
fueled by dented egos.
So you want to write a game? The
ﬁrst thing y ou have t o  do is  ﬁnd
answers t o the following important
questions.
•  What type of game is it going to be?
Is it  going to be an adventure. an
arcade game, a sports simulation or a
war o r  strategy game? I t  i s  a n
important choice since arcade games
sell considerably more than others.
If it isn't then forget it. as no one is
going to consider the 81st version of
I f  you've got a brill idea for a game, but you're not too
sure how to go about it, this article will provide the tips
and advice that will put you on the right road
By Tony Hetherington
Gauntlet. Space Invaders or Marble
Madness. You can only con some of
the people some o f  the time and
your're unlikely to get away with a
ripped-off game. After all how would
you feel if someone stole your ideas?
• Which computer trill it run (in?
The C64 still has the biggest market
and so a game for this machine should
sell well. However. you should also
think whether t h e  game c an b e
converted to other home micros; does
it need the extra capacity offered by
disk or can it be updated to become
one o f  the growing band o f  Amiga
games. Whatever machine you choose
you should try and push it to its limits.
•  Is this game yam best idea?
It's  s u r p r is in g  h o w  o f t e n  a
programmer gets stuck in a project
and shelves other ideas until they've
ﬁnished w hat they're work ing on.
Sometimes the best idea never sees the
light of day.
•  Is the computer necessary?
An odd question but an important one
when y ou consider the number o f

games of  the book, ﬁlm and board
game t hat  ar e appearing o n  t h e
shelves. I f  the computer version is
actually har der  t o  play  then it ' s
unlikely to be accepted.
•  Will the game have lasting appeal?
It takes almost six months for a game
to reach the shops so don't make it too
topical as it will be out of date by the
time it's released. For example, at the
time of writing this the news is full of
storms, ﬂoods  a n d  stock mark et
crashes but by the time you read this
Once y ou'v e ponder ed thes e
pertinent points you should have a
working idea. I f  you haven't, then
don't despair as software houses are
always o n  t h e  l o o k  o u t  f o r
programmers for conversion work or
to team up with a games designer who
can't program. T h e  bes t w ay  t o
approach them is to show them what
you c an d o  either through demo
programs or your version of a coin-op
game.
Writing the Game
When you write the game use a well-

assembler as well as commercial sprite
editors and graphic packages as this
will make life easier.
Include as much animation and
graphic detail in your game as you can
possibly cram in as this will not only
grab the eye of the software manager
but also the buyers and reviewers. For
example, the most memorable part of
()din's Heartland i s the way the
skeletons crumble when they're shot.
Leave room for a sound track or
sound effect i f  you can't do them
yourself. but ensure they can be turned
off as many players have their games
going late into the night.
Include features such a s high
score tables, load and save game
options a n d  joystick a n d  user
deﬁnable keyboard options to make
V our game as playable as possible. If
you've got room. include a  demo
routine or short on-screen instructions
so players can load and go.
Write your program using clear
structured routines and keep them
well documented. It may sound like
hard Nsork but it will actually make
things a lot easier particularly when
your debugging o r make changes.
Software houses nearly always want
changes.
When you've ﬁnished coding. test
and debug i t and ensure that you

actually like playing it. I f  you don't
then nobody else will. When you think
you have the best version save i t
several times, try it on your friends and
then submit it to a software house.
Submitting Games
It is important to  ensure that you
include all the relevant information
including details o f  the machine
requirements, a short description of
the game describing why it's different
and hints or saved game positions so
that the software evaluator can see as
much a s  possible, a s quickly as
possible.
This is all parfof making it easy for
the software house to say, yes!
If you haven't ﬁnished the game
then send at least a demo routine or
some sample graphics as it's very
difﬁcult to get an idea across to a busy
man only on paper.
Send the game to the software
house that's right for your type of
game. For example you'll probably be
wasting y o u r  ti m e  sending a n
adventure to Elite or a shoot-em-up to
Level 9.
Finally, don't give up. It is unlikely
that sour ﬁrst effort will be accepted
on t h e  ﬁr s t attempt s o  ta k e
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988

constructive criticism and learn from
your mistakes.
How much can you earn?
The papers were once full o f  the
thousands that young programmers
were making and I'm afraid these
accounts a re  largely exaggerated.
However. i f a game is accepted and
sells well on more than one formic it
could bring in a tidy sum. Therefore you
should be careful about what deal you
accept. Some software houses offer a
ﬁxed sum while others have a royalty
payment paid for each game sold.
You're probably better o ff with a
royalty deal since i t  also shows
conﬁdence in your own game. Either
way ask for an advance and a contract
and check the small print.
There is no real need to involve
lawyers and secrecy clauses to protect
your work since I ﬁnd that sending a
copy o f the program to yourself by
recorded delivers' is proof enough.
If you think this is all too much
then why not start the ball rolling and
send o f f  a  program t o  Y o u r
Commodore. I f  it's accepted you'll
receive a cheque for your program and
you'll be well on your way to program-
ming for proﬁt!

resolution and character screens can
be dumped at full or half paper width
by simply pressing a function key. A
user fr iendly  B A S I C  program i s
provided to simplify the setting up of
the mac hine language pr ogr am.
Screen location addresses can be given
in decimal or hex and you can also
dump screens w hic h us e special
character sets. Any printer which uses
the Epson set of control codes can be
used when connected to the user port
on the CM.
The Epson FX80, the Epson L X80.
the Canon PW-1080A or  the Kaga
Taxan printers will all work correctly
with Multi Dump. You will need a
cable with a plug for the CM user port
on one end and a Centronics printer
plug on the other end. These can be
bought made up for about E15, or you
can make up your own as described in
the October 1987 issue o f  Your
Commodore,
Typing in Multi Dump
The machine code program whic h
does the work is given in program I as
a self-cheekine BASIC program. Type

this in and save it before you run it.
Once you have it safe, type RUN. The
chances are that you will have made a
typing error, and if so the program will
tell you which line the error is on.
Correct the error and RUN it again.
When there are no more errors vou
should save the program again.
You can now test Multi Dump by
typing SYS52662 and then pressing
function key 13. Provided your printer
is switched on and connected correctly
you should get a half page width dump
of your screen on the printer. I f  you
have additional blank lines on your
printout don't worry, this  can be
corrected by using program 2, which is
the BASIC set-up program for Multi
Dump.
Using the Set-Up Program
Press RUN/RESTORE to switch off
Multi Dump and type NEW (I hope
you remembered t o  s av e y o u r
corrected program!). N o w  ty pe i n
program 2 and save it. Notice the gaps
in the line numbers, these gaps are for
lines which w ill be added later. A
dump of the ﬁrst page of the set-up
Multi
Dump
program is shown in ﬁgure 1. As you
can sec, the set-up program asks
questions which must be answered
with Y for yes, or N for no. Answering
Y for  each question will restore the
default values t o  the Multi D ump
machine code. If you answer N to any
of the ﬁrst three questions, you will
then b e  asked f o r  t h e  loc ation
addresses of the screen or character set
you want to use.
These can be given as decimal
values, or, if  preceded by the dollar
sign, as hexadecimal values, e.g. the
program will accept either 57344 or
8E000 as equally correct forms at
input.
You can decide where on the page
you want to position the small screen
dump. Typing in zero puts the picture
on the left half of the page. while 40
puts the picture on the right half.
If your printout has narrow black
hands across the page. answer N to the
narrow line feed question. This will
increase the line feed fr om 23/216
inches to 24/216 inches and should
correct the problem. I f  your printout
has white bands between each printed

The machine code for Multi Dump
is tucked away at the top of the spare
memory block - from 52646 (SCDA6)
to 53247 ( KETT) . This means that it
can stay there without interference
from BASIC programs and is safe even
from m a n y  m a c h in e  language
programs which are stored at 49152
($C000).
Once y ou have installed M u lt i
Dump, you can load your own BASIC
or Machine language program, use it
to draw a picture, or create a screen
from CBM characters and then press
the appropriate function key to get a
hard copy. (This will work only if your
program does not overwrite Mult i

Simplifying Multi Dump
You can load and run programs 1 and
2 each time you want to use Multi
Dump, but it is much more convenient
to store the machine code as a program
and load this automatically every' time
you run the set-up program.
To do this you need to modify the

Printing your Character Screen
Press key 15 or 17 and Multi Dump will
give you an exact copy of your screen
as you see it This means that you can
use all the graphic characters, or the
lower case character set and they will
all b e  faithfully  reproduced. T h e
default character screen is the normal
text screen which starts at 1024 ($0400)
but the BASIC set-up program allows
you t o change this to any memory
block you want. I f  you wish, you can
also use Mult i D ump with special
character sets.
Printing your High Resolution
Screen
Pressing key 11 or  13 will result in the
high-res screen being dumped to the
printer. The hi gh-res screen is stored at
a different memory location to the
normal text screen. Multi Dump uses
as a default the memory block at 8192

A
many excellent commands to  allow
structured programming. it leaves a
little to be desired on the statements
which provide line numbers. I t  is
always a nuisance to have to guess the
line number that you want.
Suppose you want to jump to a
subroutine, which you haven't coded
yet you must guess the line number
that you think you might start coding
at. Almost always, this is not the case.
It would be so much easier to type
•GOSUB "CLEAR SCREEN" ', then
later deﬁne the "CLEAR SCREEN"
label to denote that the following code
is where this GOSUB is pointing to.
Another useful feature would be if
this subroutine wasn't actually in the
main program, but was the name of
another subroutine which was stored
on disk or tape.
This would provide the user with
the ability to call subroutines which
had been previously written and tested
without having to retype them in.
This would then allow libraries to
be built, and if you update one of the
library modules, all programs using it
will be modiﬁed without having to
alter all programs. All you have to do
is relink them.
All this provides more facilities to
do structured programming and to
encourage better programming
techniques.

Label Linker
Learn the secret of labelling for BASIC programs which
allows easy appending of separate modules
By David Kelsey
Deﬁning Labels
As already described, we use labels
instead of line numbers for statements
such a s GOSUB, GOTO, TRAP,
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
20
RESTORE etc. This is done by just
replacing the line number with text.
The text must be enclosed by inverted
commas, e .g . GOS U B  " T E S T
PRINT"
We also need a way to deﬁne which
line numbers refer to labels, and this is
done by using the REM statement. The
following example shows how t o
deﬁne a label:
REM rCLEAR SCREEN"
The te xt within th e  inverted
commas is the label, and the $ signals
the program that this text is a label.
There are restrictions put on labels,
and the ﬁrst of these is a label cannot
be greater than 16 characters. Also you
must deﬁne a label as you cannot just
GOSU B
Linking
You can just have one program which
uses labels referencing lines in other
places within the same program, but
the Label-Linker allows much more
than that.
It provides the facility t o  join
several separately saved programs and
create one large BASIC program. Not
only that, but you can reference a label
from one program which has been
deﬁned in a totally separate program.
This means however that you cannot
use the -

memory. The practical use of this is to
want to join, as the Label-Linker will
not know which one you are refering
to. This process o f  joining is called
LINKING.
The separate programs that are to
be linked together need not neccesarily
be complete programs, but could just
be small subroutines o r  even jus t
blocks o f  D AT A statements. These
programs are called MODULES.
The Label-Linker will require the
names of the modules that you wish to
link, and the order that you give them,
will deﬁne the order of the ﬁnal BASIC
program.
There is one extra facility that the
Label-Linker provides. I f  you have
deﬁned a  subroutine, and saved it,
instead o f  hav ing t o  g iv e  t h e
subroutine a label at the beginning of
the routine, vou can just reference this
routine by using the name vou have
saved it under as the label name. For
example, i f  the routine was saved
under the name "CLEAR SCREEN",
then all you have to do to call this
routine would be to:
GOSUB "CLEAR SCREEN"
No 'REM S' line is  needed in  the
routine.
"CLEAR SCREEN" is treated as a
label, and so must be unique. An error
would result if you have a line 'REM
"CLEAR SCREEN"' in any o f  the
program modules as well as a program
name.
While coding a  program using
labels, it is still possible to renumber
the program, b u t  obviously a n y
statements with a  label will remain
unchanged.
 Below is a listing of this type of use.
It has three separate modules which
are described under their own headers.

Note that you can link  program
modules or just data modules. There is
a danger with data statements. If you
include a module which reads its own
data statements, and you have another
module which reads data statements,
then there is the possibility that the
modules could start reading from the
wrong position or  the wrong set o f
data statements. T o  deal with this
situation, the RESTORE statement
can be used to inform BASIC where to
start reading from. The RESTORE
statement also works with labels as
shown in the above example.
Using the Label Linker
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
21
allow code programs to be stored in
the lower half of memory, with the
BASIC program above it. Then your
BASIC program can tell these machine
code routines. It also lets the user use
memory n o t  us ually  reserved f o r
BASIC, (e.g. the ,section at $1300).
The default is the usual start of
BASIC text '  COI*. Once you have
saved the program, and reset the
computer, i f  you use the D L O AD
command, then the program will be re-
loaded at wherever the BASIC start is,
not at the address you may have linked
it t o .  This  won't affect the actual
BASIC program, but it won't be in the
part o f  memory you want it. To get
over this, you can either re-direct the
start o f  BASIC using the W A D E R
programs giv en, a n d  lo a d  us ing
DLO AD as usual, or you could use the
BLOAD command, which will place it
in t h e  area i n  memory  that y ou
speciﬁed when running the Label-
Linker. However, because BASI C
hasn't been told where this program
starts, it will either not recognise that it
is there, or you will just get rubbish
displayed when you try and LIST it:
'Display link map on scn or  ptr
(sip)?
At the end of the linking, a link
map is  produced (this is  explained
later). This tells the system whether
you want to output the map to the
printer Or screen.
If nothing i s  entered o r  a n
unrecognisable character is  entered
then the output is  defaulted t o the
screen. From here, all that is required
are the modules to be linked. The ﬁrst
prompt is:
'ENTER MAIN  MODULE NAME > '
This asks for the main program
controls and the use of the external
subroutines.
The prompts are as follows:
'ENTER MO DULE NAME -> '
These are the names of the programs
containing t h e  subroutines. J us t
pressing enter on any of these prompts
will start the Label-Linker processing,
producing the ﬁnal 'object' program.
Both t h e  entries  f o r  ' M A I N
MODULE' and ' M O D U L E  names
are the same. I f  you just enter the
ﬁlename, then it will try to load from
disk, device 8. However the medium
where the modules come from can be
varied. A  preﬁx can be given in the
form of 'p:Filenaine', where 'p' is the
device where the module comes from,
and 'ﬁlename' is  the name o f  the
module to be included.
The following table gives t h e
possible options for devices:

It is possible to add devices onto
this, and deﬁne your own preﬁxes, for
example a virtual (RAM DISK) disk at
device address 12 could be given a
preﬁx of 'h'. This is described in the
expansion section.
Note that whatever order you give
the program names. they will have the
same or der  i n  t h e  ﬁnal complete
program.
When the Label-Linker replaces
labels with line numbers, it doesn't
necessarily replace i t  with the line
number that the label is deﬁned 9n, It
replaces it with the ﬁrst non-REM line
number after the label, for example:
150 G O S U B  "TEST PO R
This line is replaced by:

The j u s t  refers to the fact that

doesn't matter for this example what
they are.
The line numbers say what line
number this label is  replacing. not
where t he label deﬁnition c an be
found. Remember that when linking,
the Label-Linker locates the ﬁrst 'non-
REM' line after the label deﬁnition.
128 P R O G R A M M I N G E
Messages
The Label-Linker has a lot of error
checking, and will display any relevant
error messages. These are as follows:
device 'x' not present this  means that a
device which has been assigned the
preﬁx 'x' (x being just an example) is
not c o m m u n i c a t i n g  w i t h  t h e
computer.
ﬁle 'example' on device 'x' does not exist
— the ﬁle name example could not be
loaded as the ﬁle couldn't be found. Or
no disk is in device 'x'.
'x' has illegal device number — a preﬁx
has been deﬁned with a device number
which isn't in input medium, e.g. you
might have selected the device number
for the screen. It isn't possible to load
from the screen.
no memory left to load 'example' — all
memory has been used up; cannot load
this module, or any other module after
it. You can either reduce the size of the
program. or the BASIC start address.
unknown error on loading 'example' —
the ﬁle 'example' could not be loaded
due to some kind of error, not listed
above.
line no. '11111' in module 'example'
contains unresolved reference — the
module 'ex ample' c o u ld  n o t  b e
renumbered because the line '1111 l'
has a statement which refers to a line
number which doesn't exist in  the
module.
over 65535 lines in complete program,
unable to continue — while joining the
modules together, the number of lines
so far exceeds the maximum possible
in BASIC. Lines would have to be
concatenated to reduce the number of
lines in a module. ( I would be very
surprised if someone made this error.)
unable to update following line, too long
— the line listed below cannot be
updated because when the labels are
replaced by line numbers, the line is
too long to cope with. Another way
this error could occur is if you have
entered a  line using the shorthand
method, which allows longer lines to
be entered. I f  this error does occur.
then the offending line will have to be
split into two separate lines. Also note
that the line has been renumbered.
unable to update lines due to lack of
memorvr — while trying to replace labels
with line numbers, all of  memory is
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988

an unknown error has occurred during
•renumbering or trying to replace a line
another error, not mentioned above
has oc c urred ( s hould nev er  b e
displayed),
no label deﬁned in line below — the line
displayed has a statement which can
have a  label, b u t  ther e a r e  n o
characters w i t h i n  t h e  inv er t ed
commas. e.g. GOTO '-" will cause this
error.
label too large (>16) in line below — a
label has been deﬁned or used which is
greater than 16 cha racters.
label 'example' already deﬁned — the
label example has been deﬁned at least
twice. You are only allowed unique
labels within the whole of the program.
You cannot use the same label in
different modules.
no line number, label or statement — a
statement requiring a  line number
label or  more statements, hasn't got
any, e.g. 10 IF A=I THEN
Label 'example' not deﬁned — the label
'example' has not got a deﬁnition in
any of the modules, i.e. there is no line
with t h e  s t a t e m e n t  R E M  $
"EX AM PLE"
Labeling Statements
The following statements can have
labels instead of line numbers:
GOTO
GOSUB
ON GOTO
ON GOSUB
R ESTORE
RESUNIE
Commands such as RUN. LIST etc
CANNOT have labels, even if they are
used within a BASIC program.
These commands can be expanded
on. If new commands are added to the
BASIC, then if  these new commands
use TOKEN crunching. then they can
be added to the Label-Linker.
See the section on 'ABILIT Y TO
UPGRADE' for further information.
Final Notes
During the time the Label-Linker is
running, NEVER press RUN/STOP
and RESTORE. I f  you have typed
something wrong. or you just want the
Linker to stop, then you will have to
use the RESET button.
Another thing that you may ﬁnd
useful, is to set up the boot sector for
the Label-Linker. T o  load, all y ou

It is possible to have the Label-
Linker permanently loaded, but you
would have t o redirect the start o f
BASIC variables to at least the address
$3090.
The Label-Linker does its  own
renumbering, so when the program
has been linked, you will ﬁnd the line
numbers in steps of I, starting at I. If
this is not satisfactory, you can just
RENUMBER the program.
Ability to Upgrade and Patches
As mentioned earlier, it is possible to
upgrade this program t o  allow for
extra devices or mediums for modules,
and it is also possible for it to cope with
extra commands which may also use
line numbers. A l l  t h e  statements
within BASI C  7.0 whic h use line
numbers have been included, but i f
BASIC is expanded, then this program
can cope with this. However, the new
BASIC statements mus t b e  tok en
crunched for this program to recognise
it, and as one token labels are not
possible in BASIC TO, then two token
labels must be used. As the tokens Ste
and See have t o  be used t o  their
full extent, expansion h a s  been
based around the user of these, For
example, if  you add a  new BASIC
statement ' C A L L ' ,  a n d  w h e n
interpreted by the BASIC which has
been modiﬁed, it is crunched to the
tokens l i e  $44', then these values
could be added to the Label-Linker
such that if  a label was placed after
'CALL' instead of a line number, then
the Label-Linker will recognise it as a
label, a n d  replaced i t  w i t h  t h e
appropriate line number.
A u t ilit y  pr ogr am h a s  been
provided to do this for you.
The Utility Program
The utility program has been supplied
in separate modules for you to use the
Label-Linker on.
Each program should be saved
under the names given in the comment
block at the start of each module, The
four modules are:
(JTILMAIN
UPDATE DEVICE
UPDATE COMMAND
TXTCNTLMOD
(This is a simple text input and display
module which could be modiﬁed and
incorporated into your own programs
if you wish.)
128 P R O G R A M M I N G " '
Run the Label-Linker as explained
above. Press enter for the ﬁrst prompt
and select screen or printer for the link-
map. When prompted for  the main
module name type 'UTIL.M A IN' and
press return. For other prompts. type
in the following order:
UPDATE DEVICE (return)
UPDATE CO MMAND (return)
TXTCNTL.MOD (return)
(return)
It s hould n o w  s ay  link ing i n
process.
If all goes well, the messages 'pass
I' and 'pass 2' will be displayed, and
then after a little while, the link map
will be printed.
Save the program under the name
'LABEL-UTILITY'
Enter a n d  s a v e  t h e  p r o g r a m
'BOOT.UTIL'
To r u n  t h e  u t ilit y ,  t y p e  R U N
" BO O LUT IL"
A menu is displayed giving the options
available,
The ﬁrst option will let you change
the dev ic e pr eﬁx es  w i t h  t h e i r
corresponding numbers.
The existing ones are displayed and
the program prompts for  a preﬁx.
Once entered, y ou give the device
number you want t o correspond to
that preﬁx.
If you enter a preﬁx which already
exists, then the device number will be
changed to the new one just entered, If
you entered a new preﬁx, and there is
room in the table, then it is added to
the table, with its corresponding device
number.
To exist this change, just press
enter when prompted for preﬁx.
The next two options are used to
update the Label-Linker to recognise
new commands whic h hav e been
wedged into the operating system. The
way commands are stored in BASIC
programs are in the form of  special
values. As  BASIC 7.0 used all the
single byte values possible for  their
commands, it had to use double bytes
to deﬁne commands. The commands
can be expanded on, using the same
technique, but if a new command uses
line numbers, then you may want the
Label-Linker to know about these new
commands.
The current table contents are
displayed, and the program prompts
for a command, The two commands
are f o r  insert. or •d• for delete.
When either option is given, the
program then prompts for a token. If
possible, the program then tries t o
either insert or delete the token from
the table, If it can't then a message is
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
23
displayed saying what went wrong. To
exist this screen, just press enter on the
command line.
Option E  ends the utility , and
updates the Label-Linker. It renames
the current version to 'O LDLINK ER•
deleting any previous copy, and puts
the new version onto disk under the
name 'LABEL-LINKER'.
Cassette Based Users
This program has been designed with
disk users in  mind, but should be
possible to update the loader, and the
BASIC programs f o r  use w it h  a
cassette recorder. The main changes
being the BLO AD. and the BSAVE
commands, T he BL O AD  could be
replaced with ' L O A M
speciﬁying the particular bank to be
loaded.
BSAVE is a little more difﬁcult.
Either the monitor has to be used, or
there may be ways of calling the save
routine a n d  specify t h e  required
par ameter s  w i t h  B A S I C ,  a
programmers reference guide would
be helpful.
Extra Program
Included als o in this package, is a
simple compactor program. I t  w ill
remove all REMs and spaces from a
program. For example it could be used
to remove all the labels and the 'object'
program b y  r emov ing a l l  R E M
statements it' desired.
The loader is similar to the one
used by  the Label-Linker, and will
require a 'boot.loader• program. Type
in the loader, then save it under the
name 'COMPACT.DATA'. Load in
the program 'hoot .loader', and change
the 'DLO AD' command to •DLOAD
'CO MPACTDATA',
Once this is done, save the loader
under the name 'BOO1'.LOADER2%
To execute the program, just type
'RUN " BO O T .LO ADER2" •

Star Wars
i
on arcade originals. Having drained as much as possible
from Trivial Pursuit, Domark are now getting back into
action games with Star Wars.
The game replays the closing scenes of the ﬁrst Star Wars
ﬁlm as Luke Skywalker homes in on the Death Star to serve
the coup de grace to the Empire's evil plans.
The game opens in deep space as Luke tackles the Tie-
Fighters of Da rth Vadar's ﬂeet. There's nothing particularly
innovative about this phase and the whole section strongly
resembles an update on the old Startrek action screens.
Eventually the battered attackers make a run for cover
and you can enter the second stage of the battle as you pick
your way through the laser defence towers on the Death
Star's surface. As you steer your X-Fighter through the
forest of towers you have to blast the laser mounts on the top
of each of them t o pieces, in a  poor man's Starglider
scenario.
The ﬁnal attack phase is the gauntlet run over and under
the obstacles ranged along the trench which leads to the
Death Star's exhaust port. Depositing a high explosive

charge into the exhaust port at the end of the trench will
ﬁnish the Empires war machine and complete the game.
The game isn't spectacularly innovative but its strength
lies in the difﬁculty levels. There are three of these- for some
unfathomable reason numbered I, 3 and 5 - the lowest level
is fairly easy and omits the tower challenge but the highest
level is sure to get the adrenalin rushing about.
For me. Domark often fall short of the mark but it' you
want sweaty action you might like to give this a try.

Gary Lineker's Superstar Soccer
F
either play on the ﬁeld where the International Soccer is
King or watch from the sidelines in games like Football
Manager. Gary Lincker's Superstar Soccer is set to change
that as you not only select your team but also decide tactics
and play either as the centre forward or the goalkeeper.
To play the full game you will have to buy a disk drive or
be content with the severely cut down cassette version in
which you only play the games themselves and miss out on
runs in the cup, promotion and relegation battles and the
chance to improve your squad by training, delving into the
transfer marker or recruiting new players!
The cassette version does have all four league tables and
starts you at the foot of the fourth but all you can do is play
single games against human or computer opponents. These
football matches are six aside games which can be speeded
up to 15 times normal time. You can control either the

goalkeeper and hopefully make spectacular saves or lead the
goal rush as the centre forward. The other four players are
computer wingers and defenders whose actions depend on
the tactics you select whenever the game stops because of a
goal, halftime or a throw in, corner or goal kick. These
tactics determine how much of the defence will push up to
support the forwards and whether the computer players will
pass to you, the centre or shoot at goal themselves.
To take a shot you simply hold and release the lire
button when the gauge at the top of the screen shows the
direction you want to shoot in. To pass you must tap the
button and push the joystick in one of eight directions that
determines whether you pass the ball to a speciﬁed player.
the nearest player or to an area of the ﬁeld. The ﬁreworks
really start ﬂying when the ball is in the air as a press of the
ﬁre button will make your player leap to head the ball or
even execute a perfect overhead scissors kick to send the ball
ﬂying past the keeper into the back of the net!
II you have the disk version then each game becomes
more meaningful as a step nearer promotion or towards cup
glory. You can select any team to play in either an English or
American league and play 7 or 15 games each season even
though there are 16 teams in each division.
To improve your chances you will need to strengthen
your squad of ten players by trading them for more skillful
players or spending some of your initial 250 trading points
to send the entire team to a training camp or recruit a
youngster and spend trading points to build up his skill. At
the end of each season you'll receive more trading points
depending on your achievements during the past year.
The object o f  the game is t o  win as many games,
championships and cups as possible in nine seasons to
achieve the highest possible rating. The complete disk
version combines both football playing and management in
a game for the ﬁrst time that suffers only trom snail-like disk
access times. However, even with these considerable delays
this is better than the cassette version that has been cut into
oblivion and is like playing football with one leg tied behind
your back! The marks below are for  the disk version.
Cassette owners should half the marks as they only get half
the game!

blockbuster, the Christmas number one program and other
such hype. In the main you told the truth but there are
probably many disappointed purchasers bored after a day's
hard driving.
Out Run is certainly an impressive piece of programming
but stripping away the original arcade game's high quality
graphics and all-action console leaves a fairly average road
racing game.
The conversion includes all ﬁve of the original routes
but, once you've mastered the art of overtaking, most of the
game is played with the accelerator hard on the ﬂoor and all
you have to do is admire the scenery.
For real Out Run junkies there's a freebie audio tape
front the original which resembles the musical wallpaper
currently softening the sound of fast money being cashed up
at the local hypermarket. Perhaps there's a  hint o f  a
Freudian slip in its inclusion with this package.
If you haven't seen Sega's Out Run - the arcade machine
- it involves a cool dude in a hot red roadster with his seat
cover by his side. After selecting a ﬁve section route he has to
get through the trafﬁc to complete each stage within a time
limit to win the race and gain the adulation of the crowd.
This is accurately reproduced in the US Gold conversion
but it lacks the spark olchallenge and addictiveness to make
it a  worthy contender for  the Number One slot. The
programming has obviously been tackled with care to
include as much detail from the original as is possible on the
C64. Unfortunately. the compromises necessary to make it
lit into the memory has not been compensated for and this
leaves a feeling of nice program, shame about the game!
With Out Run we were promised great things but it's
amazing how some promises produce things that grate. Out
Run addicts may like to buy this as a memory of the great
arcade game of 1986 but, like most memories, its's a poor
substitute for the real experience.

PETER SHILTON'S HANDBALL MARADONA
N
England Argentina 1986 World Cup match. Peter Shilton's
Handball Maradona gives you a new perspective of the
football ﬁeld. You've scored winning goals for Your club
and country, even managed your favourite team to league
and cup glory and now here's your chance to save the day by
wearing the number-one shirt.
You begin the game as a class " A"  goalkeeper and have
to build you way up to class "P" (for Peter Shilton?).
Once you have selected the team you're playing for you
are presented with a menu that allows you to practice a few
saves, play a game or try for a skill upgrading.
If you play a game you see your goal, which is badly
defended by two useless defenders and between one and
three opposing forwards. These players will pass or dribble
the ball before they shoot at goal so you have to be ready for
anything. You even have to save couriers, free kicks and
penalties. Pushing the joystick left and right will move your
keeper across the goal with other directions sending him
diving to all parts of your goal.
It will take some time for you to anticipate the forward's
move, but when you do you'll save some of the eight shots at
goal and your side will win. The result doesn't seem
important and is mainly there for interest and to give you
practice. Your most important task is to improve your skill
rating.
Skill upgrading is harder than it seems as you have.four
shots to save but you fail as soon as you let one in. Succeed
and you'll get a four digit code which you can enter when you
load in the game another day, so you don't have to replay
your hard fought levels.
Although there isn't much to the game (that's all folks) it
is suprisingly addictive.

X-15 ALPHA MISSION
'ye always had a weakness for vector graphic games, ever
since I saw Star Wars in the arcade, and so I was delighted to
see X-I5 Alpha Mission on release, Although the graphics
are nothing special, the game is none-the-less addictive.
You play the part of a ﬁghter pilot, who possesses great
war tactics. NASA have started to receive strange messages
that were bouncing off the Moon to Earth, which turned out
to be ransom demands for huge sums of money. The threats
were from terrorists, who were manning a space station, and
would blow u p major American cities and microwave
President Reagan unless they were given the lolly.
Blowing up cities is okay, but microwaving President
Reagan? You're sent to destroy the space station straight
away.
At the start of the game you have to launch the ship into
the sky which is quite easy and can soon be mastered. There
are three levels of play that involve ﬂying, the ﬁrst being
below cloud level, where you must shoot down helicopters
and dodge nuclear missiles.
The second level takes you up into the clouds, where I
became airsick, but soon got over it. You just shoot and
dodge again, but this time it's  against jet aircraft and
kamakarzi gliders.
Finally we have space, where no one can hear you scream
- hmnimm, Spaceships are now y our enemy and will
attempt to blow you apart. They look rather like tie-ﬁghters
from Star Wars, but then again, this is  distributed by
Lucas Films. Anyway, once you've blown up the tie-ﬁghters
you must then avoid asteroid belts and dock with the
spacestation, where you have to enter a special code in order
to access it. The code number is given at the beginning of
each game, and changes each time you play.

When you have docked at the space station, a small
capsual is released from your spacecraft and must be guided
gently down onto the surface of the space station while
avoiding the small meteors.
Once this is done and you have landed you can then
begin your assault on the space station.
Eight robots emerge from your space-ship and you take
control o f  each one in  turn. There are eight different
movements (functions) for the robots, but as they are not
listed in the instructions, you will have to learn them off by

heart. These skills can be used to jump other robots and
burn away rubble from the planet's surface or even self-
destruct, but it is wise to do this only when you are near a
weapons system, which are poles that stick out of the planet.
You must destroy eight of these in order to blow up the space
station, and as you can guess, you can't afford to lose any
robots.
Phew, as you can see, there is a heck of a lot to do in this
game, although going by its graphics. it is still pretty average
looking, and the sound is nearly non-existant, but it's still a
very playable game ta k e  it from me.

I did think of starting this review with J'accuse in large
capital letters as APS subsidiary Bug Byte appear to be
trying it on and possibly contravening trading standards. Is
this a rip off or is it a rip off?
It's golden oldie time at Bug Byte and they've dredged
this one up from the days when the voice synthesis would be
described as revolutionary and the graphics as stunning.
Today it merely looks sad.
'Curiouser and curiouser', exclaims Alice a t the
beginning of the game and on ﬁnishing the ﬁrst very, very
dreary level the curiosity was revealed. This is not the
Audiogenic multi-load cassette, it's (shock! horror!) the ﬁrst
part of the disk version! As Alice reaches the end of her
perambulation along a dragon infested mountain road the
screen incites player one to switch on his disk drive to load
part 2.
Despite my efforts I could not ﬁnd any scenes to match
those depicted on the cassette insert, a possible case of
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988

misleading packaging. methinks.
The tawdry gameplay involves Alice on the mountain
road being assailed by ﬂimsy, ill-advised and ill-deﬁned
dragons who vanish into some dragonesque afterlife if they
touch her. Every now and again the dragons change colour
to herald the arrival o f the Jabberwock. After the next
colour change Jabberwock arrives looking like a fearsome
cockatoo and far less dangerous. Now is the time the
dragons have waited for as they home in to devour one of
Alice's six lives unless Alice gets the Jabberwock ﬁrst. Wow!
Even less frequently, wandering doors travel across the
screen. If Alice fails to jump over a door she's whisked back
to the start of her walk. Gasp!
Come off it APS. Try and pull the wool over someone
else's eyes. Malice in Videoland is a video nasty avoid it at
all costs but let the Mad Hatter and his friends have the last
say:
'This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:

ARCADE CLASSICS
T
really that long ago that we gasped with amazement at
delights such as Space Invaders and Asteroids?
For any of you who have forgotten what computer games
used to look like, Firebird have assembled four different
classic titles in one game.
Space Invaders is the daddy of all shoot-em-ups. Left,
right and lire are the basic controls, as you dodge from
under the barricades to wipe out row after row of aliens as
they pursue their ever-relentless path down the screen
towards you.
Big ﬂeas have little ﬂeas upon their backs to bite 'ern.
Little ﬂeas have littler ﬂeas and so ad inﬁnitum — the basic
1 principle of Asteroids. You are trapped in a giant storm of
these huge space boulders, and as you shoot at the rocks
the break up into medium sized rocks which in turn become
small rock. Contact with any of them, not surprisingly, is
lethal.
The other two games are. somewhat disappointingly,
two player games. Surely there were enough one player

crash into you or move back on himself. before he does
likewise to you, and Space War is a variation on the same
theme except that you must also avoid the sun's gravitational
pull.
Four games for two quid seems to be great value for
money but the games are extremely crude by today's
standards, even if they are fair copies of the originals. Unless
you are desperate for one of these oldies to complete your
collection, stay well away.

Kung-Fu Master is, as you might suspect, a martial arts
beat-ern-up. As usual, there is a princess who has got herself
captured, and it is up to you to organise a rescue, Various
henchmen block your way together with ﬁre breathing
dragons, killer bees, psychopathic dwarves and exploding
vases. If you make your way to the end of a level, a ﬁnal
confrontation with a guardian is all that stops your progress.
This is a reasonable game of its type, despite some blocky
graphics.
Breakthru sees you trying to penetrate 400 miles behind
enemy lines in order to rescue one of your country's top
secret agents. You are armed only with a jeep but it does have
the advantage that it can ﬂy and jump short distances. There
are ﬁve different terrains for you to cross should you accept
the mission.

more than a gloriﬁed Pacman derivative. Bentley Bear must

THE LAST MISSION
G A ME S  R E V I E W S

I've just been playing The Last Mission, the latest conversion
from US Gold.
The story has it that you are an outcast, driven from your
home galaxy - why I don't know. Anyway it goes on to say
that you must return to your home, blow up the aliens that
are trying to take over your homestead. If you do this you
will no longer have to live in exile, you would be a hero. So
how can you refuse - you jump into your super-star ﬁghter
and zoom off to your home planet.
On arrival you discover that you have zoomed into a
really poor arcade conversion. Your home looks like it's
made out of lego bricks and the space ships are bland and
small, but the music that your on-board computer is playing
is quite good.
Scattered around the planets are various silos which
when shot release a powerful weapon of some kind - simply
ﬂy over these to pick them up, then it will be ﬁtted to your
ship.
I cannot recommend this at E9.99, it just isn't up to
scratch. It could be different if it was a budget game. but as it
stands I would leave well alone.

keep them fed and juggle the supplies within your hold,
haggling with merchants for the best prices. If your ship is

payment of the appropriate amount of gold. Choose your
destination and set sail.

Once at sea, you have to prime your cannon ready for
any potential action. This involves selecting which of the
ﬁfteen guns are to be loaded and following a set pattern of
inserting the powder, tamping it down, putting in the ball,
etc. If all goes well, the cannon indicators change colour. Get
the sequence wrong and you have to start all over again.
When in combat, you will need to ﬁnd the right elevation
for your guns with a few test shots before moving along the
row of cannon trying to sink the enemy. Of course, he is
trying to do the same to you and any hits by him will result in
your crew falling by their guns. If you succeed in defeating
the enemy, you get the chalice to plunder for information or
gold, but not both.
Despite the large colourful graphics, the game is slow to
play and a little difﬁcult to control despite being icon/menu
driven. If you are looking for a strategy game, then Pirates
from Microprose is inﬁnitely
want, again, there are better games on the market. Pirates of

To aid you on your quest you will ﬁnd red barrels, which
must be shot three times to unleash their contents. Some
contain various weapons and power hearts, but there is a
chance that a mine lies inside so you have to watch your step
as the mines are very deadly. They can only be passed by
wearing a ﬁeld of force (also found in the barrels) or jumped,
but this may be impossible in some situations.
The backdrops and aliens are very nicely drawn and this
makes the game a lot more playable, however you may soon
ﬁnd yourself cursing this game as it can sometimes prove
very hard, and especially frustrating. That said, it is still a
nicely presented game that plays reasonably well with some
nice sound and spot effects thrown in. However, it could
have been improved with in-game music and better control
of the main character. but you can't have everything can

you are terminated - not very nice. huh?
The new plantation supervisor has decided to try and
improve production, which he does by creating a workforce
of zombies. Sleep is controlled by him, and you sleep in a
special chamber which makes you sleep and wake up in the
morning. There are countless pills to be taken but these do
nothing much, just slow your brain down - they are known
as the Tanq-u-pills and they slowly take away your resistance.
Our hero has managed to stop taking these pills and now
realises the danger.
This is where you step in; you have to guide a tank
containing our hero, around the giant base switching the
solar panels so they will direct the power beam into a selected
wall on each level. When vou are satisﬁed with this, ﬁre the
lazer beam and hope you got it right. If you do you'll go
onto the next level, if not you'll lose a life.
As you advance through the levels, the backdrops change
but that's about it, you will get the same aliens, same task,
and so after a while you may ﬁnd yourself getting bored. This
is a shame as the game has some wonderful graphics, but u p E R
stumbles on the garneplav side. If this had been a ﬁver or less
it would have been good, but at just under a tenner it's not
really very good value.

and bunkers of the Royal St. Georges course in Sandwich.
An icon drive golf game, you must select your club (and
suffer the sarcastic comments of your caddy should your
choice differ f'rom his own not so humble opinion), direction
and strength o f the shot. Your player lines up the shot
automatically and wacks the ball according to  your
predetermined instructions.
The upper portion of the screen gives a top down view
the hole and i f like me, your shots are nowhere near the iot 71u
fairway, you can call up a map of the surrounding area to
show where you arc in relation to the green.
All is well until you actually land on the green and your
ball is lying a couple of feet from the hOle. DistinguishingUla
between the hole and ball becomes next to imposible and
have actually putted six from a short distance.
This would have been a  reasonable i f  somewhat
simplistic simulation but for the putting ﬁasco. If you want L
i
n
really good golf game, then save your money and buy World
Class Leaderboard instead.

Hard News
A new series of Amiga compatible
hard disk systems have been launched
in the USA by the Supra Corporation.
The high performance systems
incorporate a hard disk drive in one of
four capacities, SCSI expansion port
and provide R A M  expansion
capabilities.
The four drives have 20. 30 60 and
250 Mbyte capacities and retail in the
States at $995. S I 195, $1995 and $3995
respectively..
The Supra Drives plug directly into
the Amiga 500 expansion socket and
feature Supra's own high speed data
transfer interface. Burst date transfer
speeds of 250Kbytes per second can be
achieved t o  complement the fast
seeking hard drives.
RAM boards o f  I  o r  2Mbyte
capacity can be plugged into the hard
disk units and the separate power
supply of the units is used to power the
expansion b o a r d s  t o  a v o i d

CRI,'s Amiga Range
CRL have announced their plans to
release three new games for the Amiga:
Blackshadow. Tau Ceti and Academy.
In Blackshadow vou command a
spacecraft which ﬂies over a vast,
heavily armed asteroid. After running
the gauntlet o f  defence systems,
knocking out as many' of the weapons
as possible, the ﬁnal target on each
level has to be destroyed.
Thu Ceti and Academy have
already been seen on the C64 but the
Amiga versions promise extra
excitement and realism.
Tau C e ti  takes place o n  a
decimated planet and your mission is
to close down the malfunctioning
systems which have deﬁed all attempts
to previous adventurers. In realistic
3D vector graphics, you must search
the cities in your skimmer craft and
collect the rods which are needed to
shut down the massive ﬁssion reactor
which fuels the planet.
Academy is the follow up to Tau
Ceti which allows you to design your
own skimmer. After graduating from
the Academy, you are able to tackle
one of 20 missions bust success will
rely on the design of your skimmer.
All three CR L games have a retail
price of t 19.95.

I Wonderful W'ordStar
Celebrations were called f o r  when
MicroPro passed the three million
sales ﬁgure f o r  t h e ir  Wor dStar
package. The crucial landmark was
due to be released in late 1987, so a
special promotion w a s  embarked
upon with the promise of a fantastic
Far Eastern holiday f or  the lucky
purchaser of the three millionth copy
of the wordprocessor.
The ac tual purchaser o f  t h e
momentous package c ould n o t  be
accurately assessed so anyone buying
their c opy  o f  Wor dStar  dur ing
September a n d  O c tober bec ame
eligible f o r  the Celebration D r aw
made at London's Hurlinagham Club
on November 27th.
The lucky recipient o f  the ﬁrst
prize was Ron Baker of Romford. Ron
works f o r  B r i t i s h  T e l e c o m
International as an implementation
and design engineer and it was in this
capacity t h a t  h e  registered t h e
software on BlTs behalf. The prize is a
holiday for two which he will share
with his wife, Jean.
The second prize, a compact disk
player, was won by Allan Green from
the Department of Physics at Queen
Elizabeth's Hospital. Edgbaston. An
Olympus T r ip camera formed the
third prize awarded to Julian Wates,
Senior Lec tur er  i n  c har ge o f
Computing at North Hertfordshire
College.
The three million sales ﬁgure in less
than a decade by MicroPro is stunning
when seen on a daily sales basis. To
reach this volume of sales, almost 1000
WordStar units will have been shipped
out every day! Perhaps we'll see the
four millionth sales in May or June
1990.

were all given the hip hop scratch

T
has set the Amiga world uttering with
fear, one software producer told me
that nearly 40% o f his disks were
"i n fe ctd " w i t h  a  v i r u s  t h a t
occasionally popped u p  with th e
message "YOUR MACHINE HAS
BEEN INFECTED".
In America -  where the virus is
believed to have ﬁrst started- there are
no less th a n  three maj or disk
infestations - all of which recognise the
other viruses and react accordingly.
For instance, one disk virus forces
another (found in DEC USA -  Palo
Alto) to pop up with the message "A
Virus... Yummy! Dinner Time"
This ain't funny anymore
I was recently talking t o  Darryl
Mays, a British software programmer
hoping t o  start breaking into the
Amiga Software scene with "Antrax"
(or should that be Anthrax?), he was
grieving about the the fact that one of
these viruses got in the way o f his
custom disk protection system, his fear
as that unless you switch the Amiga off
between every disk swap, the chances
are quite high th a t a  similarly
protected disk will get ﬁddled arodnd
with, thus rendering it useless.
Amiga Wars
In a  meeting. George Lucas was
reportedly asked if he had considered
supporting the Amiga for some of the
new mega-games doing the rounds,
apparently h e  came u p  with the
cracker: "Rounded down t o  th e
nearest million, there are no Amigas in
the world!"

Gossip
C64 Emuluation - again
I have just found out that a third C64
emulator is nearly ﬁnished, it will be
shown around the major hardware
companies soon. Called "Card128!"
this item is aimed fairly and squarely at
Amiga 500 owners who have n o
memory expansion whatsoever -  i t
plugs under the machine (where an
additional memory card is normally
ﬁtted).
Sporting a Z80 and a 6512 CPU,
this machine emulates a C64 and a
CI 28 with "a s  near as dammit"
software compatibility. There is a port
for the 1512 disk drive, the drive
controller software is reportedly inside
the Amiga.
Naturally this is pure gossip, but
rumour has it that Card128! works like
MS-DOS on the Amiga 2000, i.e. it has
a window on the workbench that can
act as a task under intuition! If this is
the case, then transferring ﬁles from
one machine to another should be a
cinch.
Take your Pick
There were a  fe w  red faces a t
COMDEX recently as rumours were
ﬂying around th a t th e  X E N I X
operating system had been developed
as an alternative operating system to
AmigaDOS in ease the Amiga's own
one proved to be bug ridden! Mind
you, I  also heard th a t TRIPOS
developed in the UK by the same team
that did Sinclair's QL) was on the
cards as well!
The last I  heard o f the XENIX
rumour was when I heard a CBM man
at the bar saying -  "well i f we have
developed it, then it wouldn't work

anyway, but if we haven't, then we sure
as hell will soon!"
Latest news i s that the A2024
colour monitor is on show in America;
released to coincide with COMDEX.
this little beastie has 1000 x  800
resolution. All of the pictures were pin
sharp a n d  there's n o  interlace
resolution, CBM were pretty cage
about the price, and as for the case -
YUK! I  have seen better crafted
monitors at the Atari stand -  son-N.
guys, but it's an ugly S.O.B!
A new video digitiser called "NYIT
Live!" was quietly being shown by
dealer (with a CBM badge!). I gather
the plan is to get the Amiga audience
"primed" b y  using products from
Mimetics and Newtek, as soon as
everybody is familiar with igitizing
hardware and software, CBM will
jump in with a licenced NTIY "Live!"
card and clean up on the professional
market. Only a pre-production model
was on show. but it looks promising as
it runs at 30 frames a second with 7 bits
for each RGB colour, as opposed to
the 3 or 4 you get with "ALIVE!"
Before y o u  start thinking o f
replacing your 68000 inside the Amiga
with a 68010.1 got a call last week from
a guy in Utah bitching about the fact
tht none of the Psygnosis game will
work with it ﬁtted I  haven't been able
to get any response from Psygnosis on
this one yet, but then it's your fault for
changing the Amiga's CPU isn't it?
This is a great little rumour. Did
you know that the developers of the
Amiga folght tooth and nail to have
PC slots i n  the A2000 -  yet the
American reviewers slated it for ill
omission - isn't life tragic!

from any PAL source FAST
DigiPic will capture a single picture ﬁeld in real time (1/50th of a
second) from your video source.
Save all, or a clipped part of a standard 320 x  200 picture in
IFF format. Take up to four images randomly or in sequence
before storing and working on them.
DigiPic works with the standard 16 level Amiga grey scale and
it includes a unique 32 level Grey Scale adaptor t h e  change is
dramatic! Alternatively you can produce a still picture in 32
COLOURS by using the three red green and blue colour ﬁlters
provided.
With the powerful, menu driven software you can modify a
picture captured b y the digitiser. Manipulate intensities, and
intensity gradients throughout the image for a clear result. You
can vary the contrast range, sharpness, and brightness for a
speciﬁc effect. Set the grey scale to a small number of steps for
a dramatic ﬁnish, or use EDGE to produce an image that
deﬁnes the outline of objects — create your own cartoons!
You can load your DigiPic image into Deluxe Paint, DigiPaint,
Prism, Superbase Professional, and many other programs for
sophisticated graphics applications.
DigiPic connects to any
Commodore Amiga computer.

But can an Amiga screen cope with
a C64 display? Or are you conﬁned to a
special Amiga part of Compunet? As

user, but say you want t o  send
something to Compunet 75 ha us is
unrealistic. Compunet i tse l f w i l l
undoubtedly support 1200/12(0 one
day when the majority of users have
the appropriate modem, but in the
meantime a separate 1200/1200 line
will be made available for the London
area. Amiga subscribers will also be
able to send their disks to Compunet
for them to upload onto the system.
Compunet will be offering a modem

added, software support business

Conclusions
Compunet itself is a very promising
resource for the Amiga user, It is likely
that the demo and software base will
quickly beneﬁt from upgraders, coders
and importers of American material.
There a re  already many demos
available on disc, If the C64 material is
anything to go by - there are well over
1.000 demos, previews, games, music,
utilities and art A m i g a  owners will
have plenty to keep them busy, The
editorial policy is to let authors put
their own material onto Compunet, to
monitor its success with other users
and, as editor Jane Firbank puts it, to
"immortalise the good stuff". Until
something even better comes along.
The terminal software is of a very
high standard with all the usual
features such as resizeable windows,
requestors f o r  a number to dial for
instance a n d  pull downs. I was most
impressed with the operation of the
multitasking. Ariadne have fulﬁlled an
ambitious design.

was bound t o  spawn utilities  t o
harness the 'power' without the pain. I
set out to test a few of the latest.
Zing! Keys
This is not just an add-on for owners of
Zing!, a  menu/control panel f o r
AmigaDOS, by  Meridian Software.
Zing! Keys certainly works very well
with Zing! but the provision of macro
keys for any application, from DOS to
Deluxe Paint 2, is  potentially very
useful for any Amiga user.
Macros are o f  course available
within some software packages, e.g.
WordPerfect. Most however contain
no such facility. A macro is a series of
key presses o r  c ommands  h e ld
together in a form which can be called
up by a single key press. For instance,
while u s i n g  t h e  S c r i b b l e !
wordprocessor, y o u  c a n  press a
previously deﬁned macro key to insert
a series of 'dot' commands to format
your document. Zing! Keys has a
number of very useful built-in macros
but any number can be deﬁned by the
user and assigned to Hot Keys. The
Hot Keys is  the key combination
which calls up the macro function,
An amazing feature of Zing! keys is
that you can record events as well as
strings of text or key presses. There are
a number of already deﬁned Intuition
macros which size and move windows
with s ingle k e y  presses M o u s e
movements and clicks can also be
programmed into macros.
Macros can be edited saved, loaded
r  and merged. The deﬁnitions can be
Rested, delays inserted and variables
introduced, e.g. prompting f o r  a
ﬁlename from the user, a string which
is then entered into a command line.
Further use o f  this  ability  t o
'record' is made with the HISTORY
command. C L I  c ommands  a r e

recorded and can be retrieved into a
gadget window for editing and reuse.
A m o r e  u n u s u a l  u s e  i s  t h e
SECURITY-LOCK command which
locks the keyboard until a password is
entered — handy if you have to leave
your desk and don't want anyone to
tamper with your work.
There's more to Zing! Keys than
ﬁrst meets the eye. For anyone who
likes to write their own batch ﬁles to
conﬁgure t h e ir  system t h e n  t h e
programming element w i l l  b e  a n
enjoyable challenge. Zing! Keys can be
used to customise an application for
the novice user so that he just has to
'press buttons ', o r  t o  s etup a n
'individual' environment. Separate
hot key and macro deﬁnitions can be
saved o n  a n y  d is k ,  r eady  f o r

Meridian's manual is excellent and
doesn't hesitate t o  repeat its elf i f

style sections.

think this will prove a popular feature.
Gizmoz
Gizmoz is  a  different animal. The
single disk contains a vast array o f
programs and utilities, some more
useful than others.
The ﬁrst thing you do with Gizmoz
is open up all the windows to see what
you've g o t ,  c lic k in g  o n  ic o n s
indescriminately t o  s e e  w h a t ' s
'underneath'. Some fun things pop up,
like the cuckoo clock — sure to replace
the boring Workbench clock — but
there are alot more rather static and
uninteresting windows.
Not impressed? Well, quickly get
into the excellent manual and you'll
begin to realise that here you have a
very workmanlike, even sophisticated,
set of productivity tools, The key to
the success o f  t h is  v ar iety  o f
utilities/applications is the way they
mesh with the Workbench, their way
of working is instantly familiar. The
sophistication o f  Memopad (text),
calendar (dates/times) and Rollodex

application and shared by each. That
is, text on screen can be cut out of one
and pasted into another, a very handy
integration of data which saves a lot of
time. Printing from all three is dealt
with by the Black Book tool, which
sets up output of schedules, cards and
labels.
The calendar can remind you of
appointments and the Rollodex can
dial a number from a telephone ﬁeld,
via a Hayes compatible modem. A bar,
column or pie graph can be generated
from a script written in Memopad and
pasted i n  G iz m o z  G r aph. T h e
resulting picture can be saved as IFF

muchmore besides. I f  calculating
annuity or compound interest is part
of your job, there's a ﬁnancial calcul-

programmer. yo u r calculator will
work in binary, octal, decimal and hex;
it will shift and rotate on 4, 8, 16, and
32 bit words and perform logical
operations. Copy this one straight to
your utilities disk. I opened it up while
working on a  program in another
window.
Gizmoz also contians an array of
utilities, FastPrefs lets yo u  save
Preference conﬁgurations which can be
activated by clicking their icon. A
library of conﬁgurations is very useful
if, l i ke  me , yo u  keep swapping
printers. Joymouse sets up port two so
that you can use a  joystick like a

becomes a useful 'command' to take
announcements from batchtiles.
Icon Maker turns making an icon
into the simple matter of loading an
FF tile (created, say, i n  Dpaint),
sizing it and matching the Workbench
colours, Next you choose the icon
type, device, disk, drawer, etc. and its
highlight (when you click on an icon it
can be highlighted i n  three ways,

The Gizmoz Terminal will get you
safely online to a text based bulletin
board o r  service such as Telecom
Gold. F o r  ﬁle transfer there i s
Xmodem, Simple (Xmodem but with
the original ﬁle length) and Amiga
binary. There a r e  si x terminal
emulations and full control over baud
rates. parity and so on.
The Gizmoz Hotkey allow the user
to deﬁne up to eight hot keys (key
press combinations, e.g. CTRL-ALT-
Z.) and to  assign a keyboard press
(including H E L P .  T A B  a n d
RETURN) to the key. This deﬁnition
is known as a macro.
You may ﬁnd Gizmoz Popup very
useful if you are new to the computer.
It 'pops up' a card on the screen. Two
cards describing Amiga DOS and
Microsoft BASIC are available but
you can prepare your own cards with
MemoPad. There's a  string search
facility too.
Two, perhaps limited interest,
utilities are compress and encrypt.
Compress can be genuinely useful for
ﬁle transfer — as long as the destination
has decompress available, Also, in an
ofﬁce environment. encrypt may be a
useful disincentive to anyone wanting
to peek at your ﬁles!
Finally there's a game o f Life —
well-known and to  be treated as a
freebie on Gizmoz.
All I can say is 'how did they get it
all on one disk?' Some of the utilities
are available in different form in the
public domain but you can judge their
value for your own purposes. After a
month's use, I'd now rate the Gizmoz
productivity tools as essential items
for the ofﬁce, or home ofﬁce, unless
you have already invested i n  full
versions of wordprocessor. database
and spreadsheet.

ave you ever wanted to drive a Porsche 911  Turbo, or a
Ferrari Testarossa, or perhaps just have a quick spin in a
little black Lotus Esprit Turbo? I have! 1 have wanted to
drive one very fast down a motorway, safe in the knowledge
that I could outrun any police car in the vicinity, or at least
be warned in advance by a small radar device (now popular
in the States).
So imagine what it's like - in your hand is a disk asking
•• ou to test drive one o f  the ﬁve most expensive and
prestigious cars there are! Quite a challenge eh?
Test Drive is Accolade's latest offering since Hardball,
and like Hardball, these guys really know how to design a
loading screen; digitized speech. snappy music - hey, if the
loading sequence is anything to go by, then the game looks
set to be a stunner,
And what a stunner it is! You make a quick selection
from the list o f  ﬁve cars (Porsche 911 Turbo, Ferrari
Testarossa, Lamborghini Countach, Lotus Turbo Esprit
and the Chewy Corvette), each machine has its  vital
statistics on display, you select the one you most like a n d
away you go.
The basic idea of' the game is to drive fast - very fast. Of
course the police try to stop you, after all racing along at
120mph in a 55mph zone is not their idea of sanity. Initially
the game is very simple, just don't go too heavy on the revs
counter, just take your machine (mine's the Porsche!) up to
$OO revs and drop the clutch, as the back tyres squeal. drop
her into second, and so on, until you start to feel yourself
lose control of the ear and then you slow down.
Al higher levels of the game, there are other cars driving
in both directions, there are more police, a really sneaky
hairpin bend. pits in the road and some rough dips and
peaks forcing you to slow down a bit - but don't go too slow
or you won't deserve to test drive any of these beautiful cars,

and the big letters G AME OVER will greet you.
The simulation, for what I  know of these marvellous
cars, is quite accurate, the Testarossa clearly outperforms
the Porsche 911. but the Porsche can be driven harder, the
Testarossa has less road handling capability than, say, the
Lotus Esprit, but the Esprit, like the Countache. is a little
delicate when i t  comes t o  pushing the machine into
overdrive.
A great game to load up when you don't feel like saving
the universe, and a really great game if you happen to like
fast cars. If you can, try this game out and see if you like it as
people's taste in ears and car racing games are electric at
best.

HIS I S  POSSIBLY l ' H E  MO ST  INF URIAT ING
G AME I H AVE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY LIFE. I
have asked the Editor to leave this statement in capitals
because I have played this game solidly all weekend with
very little sleep, hardly any food. I have a pain in my neck
and my eyes are slightly bloodshot - and I've enjoYed every
minute of it.
Terramex is an amazing game, starting off as a pretty
uninspiring graphic adventure, this game quickly moves on
to become one of  the best games I  have played on the
Amiga.
You play one of ﬁve national characters. who has been
entrusted with the job o f  ﬁnding recluse/mad !scientist
Albert Eyestrain (and with glasses like his y ou can see why)
who predicted that the world will end by being smashed to
smithereens by a huge meteriote.
The wrirld laughed at Albert. He went off in a huff
proclaiming that the world wasn't ﬁt to be saved.
When the meteor was seen just 24 hours a Wa N' from
hitting the iarth. we realised what a silly bunch of people we
had been. and therefore entrust one of our top agents. I lerr
Krusche. Wilbur  Fortiscue Smythe. Wu Pon& Big John
Caine or I ienry Beaucoup - to ﬁnd the Prof.
The adventure is whacky to say the least: there are lots of
things to pick up (carried by your jungle bearers)and puzzles
to solve. ihere are creatures in this landscape created by the
Prof. such as rock snakes. Petenxiactuls. and drops of acid
rain -  one touch from any of these and you lose a life.
The adventure is massive. with something new on just
about every screen. The rope bridge, for instance had me
thinking for ages until I came up with a suitably lateral way
of crossing it.
When you do meet the Prof. the game doesn't end there.
you will have to convince him the world needs saying and
surrender many of the things you have found on the way. He
is a bit of a cranky old fellow, saying things like -
available?'' between his calculations.
Terra mex is likely to be a long lasting game because parts
of the adventure are different when you play different
characters. It will keep you interested, not only because of
the detailed and colourful graphics. or becauAe of the great
music (somehow never becoming repetitive -  now that's a
ﬁrst!) but because the character interacts with you more
readily than in any other game: Tr Y and jump ()lithe edge of
a cliff without the right item and he will shake his head. trY
again, and he will shrug his shoulder's and jump.
Tins is a great game. infuriating and thought proy oking
with the right balance of whack Mess and realism - I haven't
seen a game like this on the Amiga yet, go out and buy it.
Ternimex is addictive and fun.

Grid Start is a pig of a game to get playing seriously
though. y o u  w on't reach amateur status ( let alone
professional) for a few weeks of almost constant play. The
secret of Grid Start. like real motor racing. is a question of
learning the track off by heart. of knowing your racing car
inside out. of knowing where and when to apply the break.

Fhe game seems to be heavily modelled on Atari's Pole
Position. o r  the later G X -  I ( without the night time
sequence). Dotted around the tracks are the ubiquitous
advertising signs (a drink called -
Rush - the rock group) and the bales of straw. which. upon
contact, make your car blow up.
Racing against other cars is very difﬁcult. at ﬁrst -  it
seems as if there are too many cars on the track, and if you're
unlucky enough to crash into a car (or whatever), the
chances of regaining your First place are very slim indeed.
Most of the cars speed past you. and you are destined to 24th
position -  but that's life in the fast lane I suppose.
for  all its  chunk Mess and basic (sometimes sparse)
backgrounds. this is an excellent game. Anco have sensibly
priced it - clearly making it one of the best value-for-money
budget releases I have Yet seen on the Amiga. C . C .

fortress. believed to be a central command for an imminent
enemy counter-offensive, which apparently poses a major
threat to the continuation o f  "our " advance, and must
therefore be eliminated before the ﬁnal offensive can begin.
So the blurb goes on. This is basically a think  veiled
excuse to kill, kill and kill some more.
You play a character who can withstand 50 shots, and
you can only carry 99 bullets on you. but the Eagles Nest has
plenty of ammo dotted around the four ﬂoors with which to
ﬁll your automatic riﬂe and happily k ill a  few more
Commies. Gooks -  or whatever.
Not having seen the C64 or the CPC versions of this game
released earlier. I must admit I wasn't overly impressed by
the programming or the graphics on this one. It is a sort of
World War II version of "Gauntlet

The sound effects, although realistic. seem somewhat
muted, even turning the Amiga
full doesn't help matters-a shame as there could be plenty of
scope for improvements (footsteps, ricochets. other bullets
Firing at you and the odd cry as an enemy bites the dust).
To make things easier, there is a supplied map of the
ground ﬂoor: this is very useful should you want to start
learning how to pia t h e  game.
You have to he pretty quick to play this game properly. If
You don't watch your ammo. you could end u p being
cornered by a load of soldiers without any bullets with which
to mow them down. or to shoot open a wooden door.
Eagles Nest is most certainly a playable game. a little
crass at times, and the puzzles aren't really as demanding as
with other games. but until Gauntlet is released for the

with a revolutionary new drive system that makes it almost
undetectable to the submarine's age old enemy -  sonar.
You play
commanders. ordered to test the latest in Soviet death-
mongering hardware. But (surprise. surprise), you decide to
defect. Your ofﬁcers are willing to risk their lives to join you
while the enlisted crew members suspect nothing.
After killing the KGB-assigned political ofﬁcer on board
your ship (the one man who could blow your cover), you set
off, under completely false orders to reach the West. Starting
at Revkjanes Ridge. you have to slip out undetected by
moving very slowly among the rock formations...
Thus starts the latest in simulations and "strategic
games programmed by Oxford Digital Enterprises, and with
the Amiga. they really have had a ball game, using full colour
graphics, (a lot o f  which is digitised). some sparse. but
effective sound effects, and mouse control throughout.
Red October isn't a particularly action packed game.
Being a more sedate version of "cat and mouse
avoid detection by all sides until you reach a safe port of call
(it's either that, or you crash off some country's coastline).
If you are detected by the Americans, they will help you
throughout. Russia will, of course, want to blow you out of
the water for defecting with their submarine! The English are
there also. hit their actions are not at clearly deﬁned as the
US or USSR ships, although they tend to be a lot faster at
ma noeu ve ring.
The game is  controlled completely b y  the mouse,
pointing to each respective icon for each member of the
crew. The main control panel basically informs you of the
ship's direction. the depth and speed of the ship. You can use
the compass to change course.
The sonar ofﬁcer represents the -
submitrine. while underwater. This has its disadvantages,
such as requiring a visual sighting before taking any action
(sonar traces are highly' subjective) and using sonar can also
leave vulnerable blind spots which can be exploited by
hostile attack submarines.
There a re plenty of  other options -  all of which have
something to do with the running of Red October. your job is
to plan ahead as far as you can, take defensive action (at
ﬁrst) but strategically plan offensive tactics should wil ﬁnd
yourself in a tight spot.
Red October is a good game for thinkers. There is plenty
of visual information, and the supplied maps and notes are
essential reading. Another nice touch is  the newspaper

headline at each end of the game. you will get one should you
successfully dock Red October in the West, but not all
countries are willing to accept a state of the art submarine
(with a nuclear capability) and they will do their best to fend
you off.
Lots of features, lots of options and lots of colourful
graphics, all you need is lots of time.

west was really won, then this game is for you. No shooting
Injuns here, just good wholesome family entertainment such
as spitting. shooting beer glasses (using the village idiots as
target bearers). eating as much food as you can (but you have
to keep it all down) and arm wrestling.
The games on this double disk package are bright, vibrant
and very. very silly, Instead o f  going for  realism the
programmers of this little gem have decided to make it look
like a cartoon or a comic strip and their attention to detail
has made what is one of the most graphically inviting games
around for an mac hine on the market.
This is, I think the ﬁrst wholly German program I have
seen for  the Amiga. released by a software house called
Magic Bytes it is an original game. a bit like the "Olympics"
games currently available for the Amiga. but on a more
down to earth level.
You will need a joystick to play this one, and it will gel
some pretty heavy bashing. as it is one of those games that
requires fast pushing and pulling on the stick in order to
control your character on the screen.
The ﬁrst game you play is the baccy spitting competition
(like I said, good clean wholesome stuff). You chew as much
baccy as you can without swallowing, you select the force at
which you want to chew, select the angle of the spit and
simply gob away!
Likewise, the beer shooting competition is similar, you
ﬁrst draw your gun, and roughly aim the cross over your
G A ME S  R E V I E W S
YOUR AMIGA march 1988
22
target (ranging from glasses, bottles, kegs and so on...) you
select the right moment to lire and then shoot.
All of the competitions are very difﬁcult to play to begin
with. but after a while, you pick up on the rhythm of the
game. and after that, it is plain sailing!
A very nice series of games to look at a n d  great fun to
play, especially with a second player as your opponent.
Deﬁnitely one to bring out at a party!

Q Ball
E
the Atari ST version of this game for the Amiga. It is a sort of
3D Zero gravity game of snooker with mouse control and
full colour graphics.
The problem is that while Q Ball is very easy to learn. the
game is nigh-on-impossible to play and control properly.
I have tried this game out with many different friends
(most of whom already have STs of Amigas) and none of
them could control the ball properly - even after a month's
lull playing. So in  the end we satisﬁed ourselves with
randomly aiming the ball and hitting the cue as hard as we
can (more logical attempts proving fruitless).
The graphics looks nice, the sound effects are very nice
and the music is good (when it lasts) but other than that. Q
Ball is best left to lesser machines such as the Atari ST- iris
not worth playing because there isn't a game here. C . G .

Silence, high reliability and fast access are just some of
the advantages that purchasers of the new high quality

The Cumana CAX 354 takes its power from the host
computer and offers afull 880k of formatted storage to either
A500 owners or users of the A1000 series.
Other points to ponder are, high quality NEC 3.5" double
sided drive mechanism, 1 Mb unformatted storage capacity.
and standard connectors which enable easy addition of 5.25"
drives.
For those who want to
know the real nitty gritty the seek
time (track to track) is a superfast
3ms with a settling time of 15ms,
to really zip through your
software – and all at an

now 'borrowed' by  other database
programmers) has been evolving over
at Precision in Surrey, into Superbase
Professional.
The new software tidies up some of
the old and features new elements such
as a text and forms editor. The most
Important addition however is that of
a programming language f o r
Superbase. The designers have not
come up with some esoteric database
language for us to  learn but have
sensibly made the familiar structures
and keywords of Basic available for
Superbase programming.

one ﬁle to another.
CHAIN loads a new program but
retains variable information. CLEAR
and ERASE clear variables while SET
interprets variable settings and
commands from a disk tile. ERRNO,
ERRS, ON ERROR and RESUME
help with error tracing and FREE
gives a memory free ﬁgure.
The main control structures are
FOR TO NEXT, IF THEN ELSE and
WHILE WEND. There are no line
numbers b u t you can GOTO o r
GOSUB to a label and (of course)
RETURN to  the main ﬂow o f the
program. ON GOTO and ON GOSUB
are also available.
DOS l i ke  commands COPY,
DELETE, DIRECTORY. RENAME
and SETBUEEERS are available from
within a program. CALL calls up any
U T I L I T Y  R E V I E W
DOS command fr o m  d i sk f o r
execution before returning control to
the program. DISKSPACE is also
useful when ﬁles are ﬁlling up fast.
FOE detects the end of a Superbase
ﬁle.
Superbase deals comprehensively
with time, indeed there seems to be a
strange preponderence of time based
keywords: DATES. D AY, DAYS,
HRS. MINS. DATEBASE. TIMES,
THOUSECS, TIMEVAL. TODAY,
NOW. YEAR, MONTH, MONTHS,
SECS. All are available to deﬁne the
date and time format and toexpressor
assign the required moment, down to
milliseconds!
String handling is a vital part of
database w o rk, carried o u t  i n
Superbase by the following keyword
commands: FCASES, ',CASES,
',TRIMS, UCASES, TRIMS, and
SPCALS. Number precision can he set
with FIX.
The cursor position is read by COL
and R O W  a n d  i s  assigned b y
LOCATE and HOME. NEWLINE
moves to the next line, REPLICATE
reproduces a  character a speciﬁed
number of times and SET PAGING
controls the page scrolling while
WAIT does just that. Bold, underline.
and italic text can be easily turned on
and off.
PRINT selects the printer as the
output device. PC01. and PROW
detect the printhead position and
EJECT can be used to ensure sensible
page breaks for printed output.
Tale of Two Users
I put myself initially in the position of
a u s e r  setting u p  fo r m s  f o r
presentation o n  screen and paper,
including mail merging and reports

and secondly i n  the position o f a
programmer/consultant creating an
easy t o  u s e  s y s t e m  w h i c h
inexperienced operators could use
efﬁciently.
Forms
For the former the forms editor is the
ﬁrst port o f  call. Forms have the
advantage t h a t  t h e y  p re se n t
information on screen or on paper in a
manner designed by the Superhase
user. Speciﬁed information from a
combination of ﬁles can be displayed
clearly and attractively.
Forms are designed page by page. a
printer page. not a screen full, and
each form consists o f three pages.
Pages can he saved and reloaded, and
their positions within th e  forms
swapped about in memory.

photocopy. If you can sheet feed your,
printer then an A4 form design can be
printed once, photocopied many times
and the resulting forms put through
the printer to have individual details
Filled in.
Calculated ﬁelds, which change
dynamically, can be added to the form.
They are attached only to the form,
not to the ﬁle. The report functions
SUM, SD, MEAN, MAX, MIN and
VAR are available.
Any o f  th e  ﬁl e s supplying
information to the forms can be made
the master ﬁle and new selection
criteria applied to the records.
The form can appear in 4. 8 or 16
colours and the design itself is carried
out with the aid o f  the following
'objects': areas (solid and patterned
ﬁlls), boxes, lines, images ( loaded from

'object' is placed on the form in the
desired position and can be moved,

preview of the complete form can be
displayed. Field objects can have
justiﬁcation adjusted_ can be set as
'read only' and can be automatically
given a border and/or the ﬁeld name
before the data.
Printing of the form can be in text
or graphics modes. Each object can
have a  value assigned to  i t which
indicates whether it is to appear on a
printout or not. Some design features
(especially colours) may look excellent
on screen but confusing on paper.
Function Keys and Automatic
Reports
1 F o r  performing repetitive but limited
actions on the data the user needn't go
as far as writing a program. Function
keys can be used very effectively.
Commands can be assigned to  the
function keys and activated with a
ing,le key press. For instance loading a
letter i n to  th e  te xt editor a n d
extracting a  couple o f  names and
address ﬁelds f o r  merging a n d

deﬁnitions,' which can be loaded and
saved a s required. Programming
function keys with often used strings
also helps with data entry. The text
editor has a complete set of menus of
its own and i s  capable o f  64K
documents. A  format ruler can be
placed at any point in the text, There is
help on key presses and the mailmerge
simply involves inserting ﬁeld names
in the text between the &  character
(Wordstar style).
Another boon to this user is the
automatic generation o f  reports
without the need for programming.
The reports are designed on screen
with the forms editor. On saving, the
editor automatically creates a report
ﬁle and a n  associated Superbase
program ﬁle which will reproduce the
report on screen or printer, including
title page and totals page if required.
Programming
Because th e  command language
matches closely the menu options in
Superhase. any regular user can turn
his hand to programming and quickly
get a feel for the actions which will

result f r o m  a  p ro g ra m. T h e
professional programmer can go a step
further to automate data processing or
design an interface suitable fo r a
particular Superbase application.
It is possible to create ﬁles from
scratch w i th i n  a  program v i a

corresponding QU IT, REMOVE

can be saved with PROTECT and, for
further security. a password added
with PASSWORD.
Record creation involves the use of
BLANK. E N TE R  a n d  STOR E
keywords. Field values can come from
the user with EDIT (whole record) or
ASK (speciﬁc input) o r  values
assigned directly from DATA in the
program or INPUT from disk ﬁles.
POINTER can be used to control the
pointer i n  a n  ASC II ﬁl e  when
extracting data.
REQUEST is a  vital command
which brings up one of the variety of
existing Superbase dialogue boxes.
You can manipulate menus with
MENU ON  and CLEAR (menu).
Presentation as record, table or form
can be set and records selected with
SELECT — CURRENT. D U PL I-
CATE, FIRST, K E Y  (with string
parameter), L A S T .  N E X T .
PREVIOUS and REMOVE. A  path
can be set to a validation ﬁle (which
checks data entry) and suitable error
message issued. Data entry can also be
forced if necessary.
WHERE sets a ﬁlter on the ﬁelds
selected (b y SELECT) fo r  report
output or for other query applications,
such as sorting, merging ﬁles or simply
retrieving data. Sorting is carried out
by SELECTing the ﬁelds upon which
to sort and ORDERing them, either
ASCENDING or DESCENDING.
Forms, reports and mail merging
can all be handled from within a
program. B o t h  fu n c ti o n  k e y
deﬁnitions and programs can b e
loaded automatically by creating a
program ﬁle called START, which
Superbase will load and execute on
startup, allowing a 'turnkey' system to
be easily implemented.
Conclusions
A journalist colleague recently
remarked that the potential o f the
Amiga hadn't been realised. True, but
Superbase is one of a new generation
of software now realising i t. The
creative (graphics, page design, fonts,
speech and music) is combined with
YOUR AMIGA march 1988
29
the practical power o f a relational
database. The one limitation you are
probably already aware o f is your
printer. The appearance of fonts on
screen is often much better than on a
graphics dump. The Amiga does not
have special f o n t  libraries t o
accurately reproduce these, even on a
laser printer.
The designers of Superbase haven't
made any assumptions about what the
business user will want from the
database. After all, these days the
business computer is more than likely
used i n  the engineering o f science
departments a s  m u c h  a s  i n
administration. A  scientist w i l l
appreciate the precision of numbers
and the accurate dates, even including
changes to the calendar in 1752.
Superbase, like all good software,
creates its own working environment,
The new features o f  Superbase
professional a l l o w  th e  powerful
features to  be extended o r for the
environment to  be restricted for a
particular category of use or user.
The fast Amiga interface shines
through but I must mention, as I have
with all the disk based software, that
the performance of the Amiga ﬂoppy
disk drives inevitably slows down the
movement between some operations.
Users who have Superbase up and
running daily would beneﬁt, indeed
proﬁt, from a hard disk (they start
from E694 from Precision).
When Superbase was demon-
strated to me on a 5I2K A1000. the
program ve ry quickly ra n  i n to
memory problems. These were
instantly cured by the ﬁtting o f a
Promiga tnegaboard 2  f r o m
Progressive Peripherals. I suggest, i f
you are working with 5I2K, that you
discuss this with Precision before
purchase.
The documentation is of a high
standard, one manual for Superbase.
another f o r  th e  n e w  Superbase
professional features. Although these
are general purpose manuals, Amiga
users can easily avoid the material
about Superbase o n  A ta r i  a n d
MSDOS, though i t is obvious that
many Amiga features such as speech
and external music ﬁles are missing
from the inferior versions!
Upgrade prices will be available
and registered users wil be mailed by
Precision.

our Commodore is always on the
r
look out for new programs, hints and
tips, articles and even regular series. In
fact if  you have something that you
think could be of use to other Commo-
dore owners we want to hear about it.
So if you have got something which
you think  we may be interested in.
How do you go about submitting it to
us?
Below you will ﬁnd a list of guide-
lines that will help us to deal with any
item that you send in to us. We don't
expect everybody t o  b e  t h e  nex t
William Shakespeare but i f  you do
follow these simple rules then it will
make our job a lot easier.
I) If possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a margin o f  about 1 0  characters
around the text.
3) On the very ﬁrst page you should
put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any extras required - disk, printer
etc.
Your name
Your address
Your telephone number
The top of every page should have
e following information on it:
Abbreviation of the article title
Your name
The page number
READERS SUBMISSIO NS
So you own a Commodore? So you've
written some programs? So why haven't you
sent them to us?
For ex ample, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on C64 interrupts.
You should put something lik e the
following at the head of the page:
Interrupts/J.Smit h/1
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try and wr ite i n  clear concise
English, it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom o f  each page you
should put the word MORE if there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page.
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under n o  circumstances us e a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
11) Programs under 10 lines can be
i
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette,
12) I f  your article needs ally artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be an
artist but we do need to see what is
required.
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
63
13) Photographs, i f  necessary, must
be either black and white prints or
colour slides, We can take shots our-
selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a live line routine
that y ou think  may  be o f  use t o
someone else we welcome it just as
much as a full blown six part series.
15) Payment varies quite a lot and de-
pends on quite a number of factors,
such a s  complexity o f  program,
presentation o f  program, number of
magazine pages it takes up etc. Pay-
ment is generally between £10.00 and
900.00.
16) A l l  payments are made in  the
month that the magazine containing
your article has appeared in print.
17) If we do ﬁnd your submission
suitable for inclusion in the magazine
we will write to you giving the terms of
publication, the rate of payment and
an agreement form. Prompt return of
this form will allow us to use your
program as soon as possible.
18) I f  you want the program return-
ing to you, should we ﬁnd it unsuitable
for public ation, then y o u  s hould
enclose a  stamped s elf addressed
envelope.
19) The last and most important point
to make is 'get writing', we are waiting
for your articles.

Knightmare
W
confusion ... I f  you recognise these opening words then
you're already one of the dedicated followers of ITV's cult
roleplaying TV  game Knighttnare, in which teams o f
advisors guide a knight, blinded by a full facial helmet,
around a  computer generated graphic dungeon. The
graphics in the TV program were created by two Supernova
computers which are slightly more powerful than your
average C64 so this is obviously going to be a cut down
version from Activision.
You play the knight who must ﬁnd his way out of the
Knightmare by solving his problems and overcoming the
monsters and go to the second wilderness section. To help
you in your quest you can seek advice from two Oracles,
However, one is good and the other is evil so you should
listen to both sets of advice but follow none to ﬁnd the
successful middle path. You will also hear from Treguard,

the Dungeontnaster whenever you waste time or attempt
pointless actions or anything else that annoys him.
Your quest is told in 3D graphics which is displayed on
the turning pages of a book alongside a burning candle
which represents your lifeforce. As monsters hit you, and
poison and traps take their toll, the level of the candle will
plummet to end your game.
You control the Knight's movements with a joystick and
his actions with adventure style commands selected from
menus or by pressing the ﬁrst letter of the command, object,
person or sell. This may seem an efﬁcient method - however
it can cause you problems as it takes a long time to throw a
rock while a ghost and a demon chomp at your heels.
Unfortunately, the game also suffers from a  few
annoying bugs such as if you throw a rock in one room and
then enter the other, the same rock comes ﬂying across to
meet youl To add to this the graphics are crude and the

action i s  f a r  fro m th e  combination o f  traditional
adventuring and arcade action promised on the packaging.
There is no way a C64 can mimic the efforts of two
Supernovas and live actors but surely it can come closer than
this. Perhaps the approach used in Dragon's Lair and
Escape from Singe's Castle would have been better.
Disappointing I'm afraid.

which is best described as a sort of thinking man's Trivial
Pursuit.
The game poses a series of moral dilemmas to each
player in turn. It is up to you whether you decide to answer
truthfully or bluff your way out of things but you are always
likely to be challenged in which case you will have to justify
your answer. The other players will then vote as to whether
they believe you or the challenger.
A typical question would be, "If you saw your boss
coming out of a cinema that showed exclusively blue movies,
would you tell your colleagues at work?" Personally. I would
only bother if I recognised him appearing in one of the blue
movies!

Between three and ten players, either human o r
computer, can take part in a game. Setting up the game is
somewhat tedious as you must select from sixty-four
different faces for each computer player and deﬁne
personality traits for the humans. This involves deﬁning on
'a bar chart how you see yourself for each of twelve different
characteristics. These range from personal integrity via
greed to family relationships. The computer then adjusts
ur inputs slightly and presents you with a new graph at the
R E V I E W S
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
65
end o f the game according to how you answered the
questions.
The game itself depends on getting rid of your dilemma
cards before anyone else does. You have an answer card
(yes, no or depends) which is kept secret from the other
players and the trick is to ask questions which will force
players to give the same answer as you have on your card.
The problem with the game is that to get the best out of
it, you need to be watching the other players and judging
their reactions. Against computer opponents, this i s
obviously impossible. Again, with human opponents,
making them look away as you examine your answer card
destroys the atmosphere of the game. The conversion of the
game is excellent, no complaints there. I just think that this is
the wrong sort of game to be converted in the ﬁrst place.
Whereas it works well with a group of you sitting round a
table, it fails miserably when you all move to the small
screen.

found his way somewhere into the computer world. After
all, his list o f  appearances i n  recent years has been
considerable - television, books, the stage. political rallies
and the High Court. Domark have atTected the link up and
produced a games based on Archer's ﬁrst book, Not a
Penny More. Not a Penny Less.
The book, like most ﬁrst novels tends • to be semi-
autobiographical. Four totally unconnected people are
persuaded to sink their life savings into shares in an oil
company. There is the promise of enormous proﬁts but the
deal turns out to be one large con trick and the punters lose
one million dollars between them (early 1970s prices).

You play one of the four. Stephen Bradley. and it is up to
you to contact the other three and persuade them that you
ought to try and get back all the money that you were
swindled out of. Hence the title of the game.
That is the gist of the story and a very good one it is too
for whether you like Jeffrey Archer or not. he does tell an
excellent tale even i f his literary powers do not feature
among the world*s greatest.
The games itself is a different matter and I am afraid that
it takes the art of adventuring back into the dark ages. The
list of problems and bugs is phenomenal and I can do no
more than mention some of the ones that occur at the start
of the game.
The parser is pathetic. Even by the standards of games
written ﬁve years ago. it is dire. There is no inventory'
command so that if you pick something up, there is no way
you can ﬁnd out what you are holding at a later stage of the
game. Directions have to be typed out in full, e.g. 'go north
east' rather than just 'NE'. Not that you can move anywhere
anyway. At least not until you have solved certain puzzles.
The game is entirely linear in construction so that everything
must be done in an exact order. Get it wrong and it is
effectively game over although you are not told that at the
time.
Although many items are described in the location
descriptions, trying to examine them further is by and large a
waste of time. In some cases they disappear totally. For
example, you start off in your room in college (you are a
university lecturer). In  the room is a bookcase and a
cupboard. Or at least there are until a policeman arrives and
catches you with an incriminating dossier open. Then they
disappear. I I  however you manage to close the dossier
before the policeman arrives, after he as gone. re-
examination reveals a vital phone number that you managed
to miss ﬁrst time around.
Still the bugs haven't ﬁnished. Phoning Scotland Yard
puts you through to your stockbroker (perhaps this is an
intentional dig at BT). Examining the top names in the
dossier gives you a description o f your rooms again. I
managed to go and see this ﬁrst character, a doctor. on three
occasions within one game: each time following exactly the
same sequence of events because no ﬂag had been set to
instruct the program only to allow' things happening once.
There are graphics but they are o f the line variety
complete with a ﬁll routine that takes ages to complete. The
program also boasts an impressive speech routine but there
is so much hiss that it sounds like a badly tuned radio
station. Pronunciation isn't all that i t might be either.
Magdalene College is pronounced a mag-da-lin instead of
maudlin.
Perceptive readers will notice that I  was not too
impressed with this game. In fact, I would go so far as to say
that this is the worst full priced adventure I have played for
several years. The package includes a copy o f the book
which is necessary to ﬁnd out what you are supposed to be
doing. My advice is to go and buy the book and ignore the
game, especially at just under ﬁfteen pounds for a cassette
version.

is almost impossible to describe if you haven't seen it before.
The playing area is a circle with four squares of eight
different colours showing at any one time. The position of
these squares is altered by rotating two spirals within the
circle. The object o f the game is to place the requisite
number of your own pieces on your own colour before your
opponents manage the same feat. How many pieces you
need is determined by the number of players.
You have a number of moves determined by the highest
number of pieces you have on any one colour. A move can
consist of sliding one of your own pieces to an adjacent
square or twisting one of the two spirals to change the
pattern of the colours either with the object of hindering one
of your opponents o r helping yourself. I f  that wasn't
complicated enough, you can also control netural colours
and at the beginning of each turn, you can move any of your
opponent's pieces that happen to be lying on a colour you
control.
Although it all sounds very complicated, you soon get
the hang of what's going on and the game becomes quite
addictive. One advantage of the computer version is that
there are several game variations that are not possible in the
board game but against that, one of the most enjoyable parts
of the board game is moving the spiral and watching the
colours change. In the computer version. this effect is lost as
the screen blanks out and redraws with the new pattern.
Eye is the sort of board game that converts well to the
computer and fans of strategy games like this who are in
constant need of someone else to play against will not be
disappointed. Two minor quibbles. The printed instructions
are somewhat sparse and could usefully have been expanded
and also there is a silly grammatical error when you are
setting up the game (whose instead of who's). I know it's
trivial but it does have the effect of making the ﬁnished
product look unprofessional-

Welcome Back
hen N OU go into a shop to buy a game you're usually
W
greeted with a bewildering array of titles; some of which are
treasures. others are terrors. For full-priced games the
answer is simply to read through Your Commodore's review
pages and then go out and buy with conﬁdence. Even budget
games have the same pitfalls as £1.99 for a bad game is good
money wasted. However, i f you look carefully you can
usually pick up a bargain as you can ﬁnd games that were
top of the full-priced games enjoying a cut-price comeback.
Here are ten to look out for if you want to bag a bargain.
Football Manager
Football Manager has got to be one of the most successful
games ever. Launched i n  1982 on the Spectrum and
converted later for the C64 and C16 this game captures the
problems of football management and presents them in a
ridiculously addictive form. Although the game was written
in Basic the snail pace action didn't deter it's players staying
up all night to play just one more season I don't think my
neighbours will ever recover from the time 1 won the league
and cup double!
The good news is that Addictive Games is adding the
ﬁnishing touches to Football Manager II, and even better
news is that you can pick u a copy of the original from Prism
Leisure for only €2.99.

puzzles that you must solve in a race against the clock and it

The star of the game is Rockford. a little character that
must collect diamonds while avoiding crushing boulders

imported by Beyond and now is back for a well-deserved

MUSIC GRADE EXAM TIME?
You need trained ears for music exams -
Perfect Fourth AURAL trains ears.
In every music grade examination, a section
is devoted to ear testing which is called an
aural test. Although the actual marks
Ltllotted for this test amount to just under a
Fifth of the total marks available, lack of
practise in  this section can profoundly
effect the whole examination result
You w i l l  n o  d o u b t  remember t h e
nervousness that you felt during your
school (or even professional) exams, if you
knew that you were weak in a particular
subject. or perhaps even just an area of a
subject
So it is with music examinations. But with
(me major difference. Aural tests are the only
parr of the grade t n
not practice alone. A  skilled pianist is
essential. Without this help, you will be
entering t h e  exams wit h  a  g a p  i n
preparation with the result that conﬁdence
is sapped. And nervousness can adversely
affect the whole performance.
The result? A missed distinction or merit.
hut even worse o ve ra ll failure.
And this tragic state of affairs is not the fault
of the student. I f  no pianist is available to
help, then you can't practise aural, having to
rely on snatched moments from the weekly
music lesson.
You will surely agree with music teachers
that this is a totally unsatisfactory state of
affairs. Daily practise is the only certain
answer.
Recognising this urgent need, a practising
music teacher set about solving t h e
problem. After four years work and in
consultation with the examining boards.
Perfect Fourth AURAL was created. Today
you can practice aural daily in your own
home, totally without help.
Perfect Fourth AURAL  is a remarkable
computer program designed to be used on
popular home micros, needing absolutely no
computer or piano skills at all If you can play
a game - you can use aural_
Not only is AURAL intelligent • it will
randomly select one of over 250 different
tests available on each program - it will even
show you how to conduct with cleverly
synchronised graphics. Th is program is
ﬁeld-tested and has already helped students
to play with much more conﬁdence and
greatly improved results.
This is what top teachers and performers

eviewing this package gave me a
R
deep feeling of nostalgia in that it took
me back to the good old ('BM PET
days. After the initial Palo Alto HELP
chips, there emerged a  number o f
advanced tool kit packages; the most
notable o f these being the POWER
chip and VICTREE. Certainly there
were a  number o f  similar British
products but these were feeble efforts
compared to the American packages.
SYSRES demonstrates that things
haven't changed and i s  the C64
equivalent to  the excellent POWER
package for the PET.
Enough o f  the spiel, what's
SYSRES all about? Basically it is a
toolkit to allow the easy manipulation
of disk commands, programs and ﬁles.
First we have extensions to the disk
operating system. Th e se  a r e
commands w h i c h  replace t h e
extremely tedious way of accessing the
disk.
OPEN 15,8,15," " :C L OS E  15
These allow you to  copy ﬁles,
scratch ﬁles, call the directory. etc by
use of simple commands such as @ S and
*S. OK, so that's fairly standard. One
rather nice command is the list from
disk (oL). This allows you to display a
ﬁle direct from disk without loosing
any programs i n  memory. Th e
command handles sequential, relative
and program ﬁles. If you think about
it, this is a very handy facility with a
wide range of uses.
The remainder o f  the package
comprises about 30 other commands.
These ra n g e  f r o m  t h e  u su a l
RENUMBER, AUTO and DELETE
commands through enhancements to
RUN. LIST and CMD to the positively
phenomenal C H A N GE . Before
describing some of these commands, it
is worth making some points about the

author's approach to the design of the
package.
First o f all, this package can be
considered t o  be a  true operating
system. A range of enhancements such
as bi-directional scrolling, key repeat,
redeﬁnition o f all keys and default
devices are wedged into the system.
Having d o n e  th i s, t h e  system
recognises i f you run a program and
disconnects and reconnects functions
to ensure that optimum speed i s
achieved.
Secondly, rather than just provide
the basic commands, the author has
crammed in as many options as his
fevered imagination can dream up.
RENUMBER, fo r  example, allows
you to renumber the whole program,
part of it and even move a block of
code. Commands such as CHANGE
arc even more complex.
Thirdly, maximum use is made of
the many ways of storing and handling
ﬁles, allowing some extremely involved
operations.
For users of BASIC, there are a full
range of editing tools. These include:
These allow you to write code, run
and debug and edit i t in a simple
mariner. Rather than slavishly describe
all of these commands, I will mention
those which were most outstanding.
FIND: This allows you to look for a
speciﬁed pattern o f characters. The
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
74
commands is extended. however, to
allow you to specify which position in
each line to search, specify the areas to
search and to specify pattern matching
with "wild cards".
CHANGE: This ﬁnds a  speciﬁed
pattern of characters and replaces it
with another pattern o f characters.
The command supports all the options
of FIND with a claimed 700 valid
combinations. The potential of' the
command i s  q u i te  phenomenal
allowing operations which would
normally be very difﬁcult to achieve in
BASIC. Y o u  can, f o r  example.
concatenate lines to longer than 80',
characters, remove R EMS, ﬁnd
unresolved references or start a line
with a  number. I  found this a
potentially powerful command which
required a  l o t  o f  concentration
preferably with a  cold wet towel
wrapped around your head.
TRACE: Most trace commands glie
some form o f a scruffy list o f line
numbers on the screen which at best is
unintelligible and at worst wrecks the
screen format. With SYSRES. you
have th e  choice o f  two optional
windows at the top of the screen. The
-
line as it is executed and the left hand
one gives the value of each variable
every time it is redeﬁned. The options
to pause or slow execution or print the
windows ease the viewing of the trace.
MERGE: This is a true merge which
will interleave the program lines off'
disk with a program in memory.
For machine code users, the
commands are even more user
allowing the preparation and editin
of source codes. T o  allow th

is the
JCL assembler. PUT and CIET are
provided. This allows you to  take
advantage o f the superior SYSRES
functions w h i l e  ma i n ta i n i n g
compatibility with the assembler. The
PUT command strips o ff the line
numbers and saves the program as a
sequential ﬁle. Very handy. To aid
debugging of machine code, a BREAK
line is provided. This is accessed in the
usual way via a BRK instruction or
from a MON command, If no monitor
is present, details of the page where the
break occured along with the contents
of the registers, etc. are given. I f  a
monitor is present, it is entered. The
package comes with a public domain
monitor ( X M ON )  w i th  several
versions at different addresses. The
system also seems to work with other
monitors, however. One rather bizarre
feature i s  th a t th e  bidirectional
scrolling is active, even from within the
monitor. This allows you to LIST a
source code o r  BASIC  program
without leaving the monitor. This
offers some useful debugging features.

will know the irritating way that the
BASIC. pointers are left so that any
attempt to LOAD or amend programs
get an OUT OF MEMORY error. To
allow for this, three commands are
provided. BLOAD and BSAVE allow
the storage and retrieval of binary ﬁles
Without this problem. BRUN loads a
binary ﬁle and commences execution
at the start address of the code. This
command also allows you to transfer
parameters, provided that your code
requires this. The following syntax is
therefore accepted:
BRUN "myﬁle",parm 1, parm2
A slightly stranger method o f
handling ﬁles is provided by the EXEC
command. This command is aimed at
providing a  means o f booting key
deﬁnitions and other more esoteric
functions. The BASIC program is
saved as a Sequential ﬁle which can
then be handled by EXEC.
Most toolkits provide a means of
redeﬁning keys, and SYSRES is no
exception, Generally, these a re

SYSRES, somehow predictably, goes
much further. On boot-up. 18 of the

commands which are accessed b y
pressing the L OGO key with the
appropriate alphabet key. The KEY
command can be used to additionally
deﬁne most of the keys when used in
conjunction with the SHIFT key.
Redeﬁnitions can be set up manually
or by loading deﬁnitions via EXEC.
An important feature of this type of
software is the need to  give nicely
formatted output. When listing source
code or BASIC programs, SYSRES
uses white for line numbers and the
normal ink colour for the rest of the
code. The normal scroll is changed so
that you cannot accidently' lose the
screen contents by trying to move the
cursor off the bottom of the screen.
Instead, where a program is longer
than the screen, you can list in either
direction — a much more civilized and
controlled approach. LISTing long ﬁles
can be paused by pressing the SPACE
BAR or slowed by pressing CTRL,

For those .of you with printers,
things are even more attractive. Many
commands can be sent to a printer by
preﬁxing them by  *,  The nature o f
Output and the device are set by the
SETP command. By adding 64 to the
device number, a formatted output can
be obtained, This format option does a
number of things:
•  Line numbers are right justiﬁed.
• Multi-statement lines are split with
one statement per line.
•  Spaces a r e  ins er ted betw een
commands.
•  FOR-NEXT loops are indented by
level o f  nesting. F o r  example, the
following program:
90 F O R  I= I T020
100 E O R J = I T 0 . 2 0
110 F O R K =  IT020
120 P R I N T I * J * K

is printed as:
90 F O R  I= I TO 20
100 F O R  I T O  20

The obvious value of this feature is
that y o u  can wr ite a  program as
compressed as you like and still get a•
legible hard copy to aid debugging. So
far as I could establish, SYS RES does
not provide a Centronics driver.
SYSRES is hidden mostly behind
the ROMs and uses only a page o f
memory from SCF00 to KET T .  No
indication is  given o f  zero page or
other memory usage so I assume that
there are n o  speciﬁc compatibility
problems. The manual claims that the
program attempts t o  analyse other
cartridges or programs present which
might give extensions to BASIC and
make appropriate allowances. I tried
using SYSRES w i t h  t h e  M I K R O
assembler casrtridge with no obvious
clashes. Clearly, machine code users
will need to take care as to which areas
of RAM are used by their programs.

detail. SYSRES is not one of them. The
author has gone out o f  his way to
provide a full compliment of features
and t o  ensure that every detail is
catered for. The program shows an
appreciation of the 64's operation and
caters for the unusual but ﬂexible ﬁle
handling system.
The program comes on disk and
not only  is  it  unprotected. but the
manual encourages the user to make a
work ing b a c k u p ,  T h e  m a n u a l
comprises about a 100 pages o f  text
held in an A5  size ring binder. The
manual is well printed and reads well.
Unlike many  products where t h e
manual is the last and most poorly
produced item, the SYSRES manual is
detailed and offers both examples for
use and plenty of hints.
The pric e may  a t  ﬁrst appear
high but for what is a tour de force of
programming this is an investment for
anybody who wishes to use the 64 to
the full.

your life as you take on a human or increasingly difﬁcult
computer opponents at the ancient Japanese art of unarmed
combat. Armed with just your wits and a good joystick you
must literally get to grips with your opponent so you can
then throw him with moves such as Tomoe-Nage, 0  Soto
Gan. D e  As h i Bar ai a n d ,  o f  course U c h i Ma t a .
To succeed with these moves you have to grab your
opponent with a stronger grip than he's got on you and
complete a series of joystick moves that will hopefully leave
him ﬂat on the mat. At the end of the game your score is
accumulated and converted into an award that ranges from
White belt to black belt and beyond through the Dans. A
good beat 'em up that's a more subtle variation of the kicks
and chops of karate.

into three groups, running (100, 200. 400. 800, 1500 metres),
throwing (javelin. discus. hammer) and jumping Hong jump.
high jump and pole vault).
To play the events y ou will need a combination o f
keyboard hammering and timing as you gain speed and
jump or throw at the right time and are poorly rewarded for
your efforts by jerky basic graphics. The running events can
be particularly grueling, both on ﬁngers and keys, as even
the 1500m is a sprint!

eating a cheese sandwich. Unfortunately, this is no ordinary
dream as it's a nigh tma re and is very real. You are trapped in
a car in tovland and are pursued by ﬂuffy snakes, wooden
snakes, toy trucks, turtles, joysticks. ghosts and a whole host
of other toys that have turned nasty and are out to get you.
Your only defence against this attack is a nuclear

eing a good snooker player is supposed to be a sign of a
B
mispent youth. Unfortunately, I chose the less proﬁtable
pastime of pinball. Asa result I have hit more targets. scored
more replays and claimed more extra balls than Steve Davis
has potted blacks.
Up to four players can play Micro Ball or more likely you
can play four games at once as you attempt to keep the ball
in play, knock down sets of targets for bonus multipliers and
score the 250,000 points necessary for the ﬁrst extra ball
(480,000 and 720.000 bring second and third extra balls).
As the scores rack up. watch out for "out shots
bounce can send the ball down one of the side channels
before you can get to the tilt button.
Micro Ball occasionally deﬁes the laws of physics as the
ball seems to stop in mid air and then carries on once the
program has worked out where it's going. but for € 1.99
pinball wizard's will enjoy this.

As bowler runs in he can decide where to bowl the ball
and where to pitch leaving the batsman to judge the ﬂight of
the ball, decide the angle of the shot and get the bat to the
ball. If you hit the ball you can attempt to run between the
wickets. The ﬁelding side can then select a ﬁelder to run for
the ball and attempt a run out if they haven't already bowled
you.
This isn't an easy game to play: so don't expect to score
too many  centuries particularly against the computer
opponent.

world's best display team? Noyv's your chance to ﬁnd out as
you jump into your Hawk and take to the skies with the elite

The game features two parts in which you learn how to
ﬂy a Hawk and then ﬂy in formation with the rest of the
team. The controls to ﬂy the I lawk can be selected for
the keyboard or joystick and include controls for the Hawks
thrust and brakes. ailerons and elevators. Once you can keep
the plane in the air and on course you're ready to join the rest
of the squadron and perform formation manoeuvres such as
the Diamond, Pyramid, Eagle and Manhauen. In all these
formations you ﬂy a plane at the back of the group so your
screen is full of the other planes which can make it difﬁcult
to follow.

J  Burst Nibbler is actually a two part system a  software ;adage end a parallel cab/e to connect the
154111570/1571 to 64/128 state type
Li What gives Burst Nibbler I% power? Conventional nibblers have to decode the data from the disk
before it can transfer it using the serial bus -  when non standard data is encountered they are beat.
Burst Nibbler transfers data as raw nal code via the paraEe', cable without the need to decode it so you
gut a perfect copy of the original.

difﬁcult fo r Basic programmers to
access with WEOS. Continuing on
from last month's mammoth program
we give You the remainder o f the
programming information you need to
use WEOS together with a  demo
program (at the rear of the magazine)
which illustrates how to use some of
the WEOS commands.
CHECK LIST
• Due t o  a  small programming
mistake you can't deﬁne a shadow

the text string, follow it directly by
another comma -  you have to use a
value or a variable instead.

confusing.' Well it isn't, let's imagine
the following:
You've got three menus with the
following names:
'DESK','FILES','OPTIONS' as you
can see the headers have a length of 4,5
and 7 characters. So the ﬁrst menu
starts at 0 (begin position) and the
second menu starts at the ﬁfth position
and the last menu at the eleventh
position. Each Menu will be separated
with a space as you can see.
Since t h e  p r i n t position i s
calculated by the other menus, you'll
have to be careful with the x-length of
the window. L e t's imagine th e
following: o  u have already deﬁned six
menus and the seventh (which you
want to add) starts at position 36 but
the length of the window is 16, as you
can see this wrong because the sum of
xp and xl exceeds 40.
• The x-length o f the window also
depends on the shadow ﬂag. if this is
set to one, you have to add 1 to the x-
length. So remember: xl-f-xp+sh may

not be greater than 40.
• Watch out that the length o f the
names of the options may not exceed
the ( x-length )-2.
• Sometimes when you deﬁne menus
and you deﬁne different colours, you
can discover that the inverted option
line when you choose an option has
two colours!
This is because WEOS will not ﬁll up
the remaining gap of characters, to
solve this problem. ﬁll each option
(after the menu text of course) up with
spaces. Try this:
10 M E N U  1 .1 0 ,2 .1 "H EAD ER
O P T I
20 DESK 94:MENU 1 ON:PAUSE 0
Run it and go to an option (ﬁrst
turn your pointer on) and click the
button. As you will see the inverted
line has two colours! To  cure this,
modify line 10 to:
10 M E N U  1,10.2,1.“HEADER
OPTI(4 spc) — OPT2 (4spc) I ",4.11.1
Run it again. This time it is perfect.

As m e n t i o n e d  e a r l i e r  t h i s
command gives you the ﬁrst way to
read data when WEOS is performed.
•  Some people may ask themselves
why I  added the commands MENU
ON and MENU OFF since WEOS 2
does all the work for you. Well this is
because some people don't have a
joystick or a mouse.
One ﬁnal note -  i f  you select a
menu it is possible that nothing will
happen. This is because the computer
is too fast. To solve this problem try
this:
PO KE 3 9 2 5 1 .  d e l a y  ( v e r y
fast;255=Yery slow)
TYPE
Syntax: TYPE (x)
Mode: all.
Output: all.
This function is the data read function
of W EOS.
When you perform WEOS, it changes
a lot of data in your computer, to read
it out, use this command!
YPE(0): which type of character has
collided with the pointer?
0...nothing
1...a special symbol
2...a menu !
If TYPE(0) returns a zero, TYPE(' )
will return wrong values (so you ﬁrst
have to check TYPE(0)).
If TYPE (0) returns a 1, TYPE (I) will
return the symbol number.
When TYPE(0) returns a 2, TYPE( I)
will work the same as the MENU(0)
command. The special symbols are:

Symbok 1 and 2 are at both edges

used in  most cases as O K symbol,
symbol codes 4-7 are arrow codes
which c an be used as  markers o r
something different (e.g. Preference

• The s y mbols  hav e n o  special

and thus you still have to write the
routine to perform it.

They may not contain any control
character (such as colour codes or
CR). The header string may not be
greater than x1-6, and if you want no
header simply create an empty string.
The window cursor is now at (0,0).
This is  the upper left corner of  the
window, and als o means that the

Any screen/window operation is

This command opens a•static window
(SW). T he only  difference between
APWs and an SW is that they don't
need a start position. It is calculated
automatically for you and centred in
the middle of the screen (nice hey??).
You simply have to specify the window
size. When you try to open an SW
there is  still an PD M o r  a SW on
screen, an error is printed. However.
this will not happen if there still is an
APW on your screen.
The border of a SW is also different
(like any different window type). A SW
has the highest priority, (lowest has a
APW and a PDM is among them).
Well what does this mean? It means
that you have to close it ﬁrst by S•CLOSE
before you can use commands such as
wcopy or wswap. And this is the reason
why each time you try to open a PDM
or APW when there is still a SW on
your screen an error is given. The last
three paras have the same function as
by APW and PDIM. e.g.

one Cruncher is a soap opera with a difference as the
B
star of the show is a dragon called Bono who makes a nice
little earner by collecting skeletons to make soap that he
then sells to the monsters bathing in his castle's moat.
Your job as Bono is to keep your customers happy by
generatjng a constant supply of soap. You can get limited help
from your business partner Fozzy whose the equivalent of a
heavy. but since he's not too bright you're on your own most
of the time,
The headquarters of the "Bono Bathing Company" is
your dark. dank and dingey castle and the game is set in a
series o f increasingly difﬁcult chambers. There are 22

chambers to be solved and if you manage to complete them
all you will win a portable stereo! That's how conﬁdent
Superior Software are that you'll fail!
Each chamber is a maze of walled off root* that are
ﬁlkd with earth which our hero can dig through. There are
also doors that can block the way until the key is found and
then used properly! Skeletons have to be collected, as do
cauldrons which turn them into soap; staricases that lead up
to the bathing monsters and deadly monsters, spiders and
glooks tht populate the caverns and can kill you with a single
touch and trapdoors that lead to oblivion!
To complete a cavern you must concoct the required

number of soaps by taking skeletons to cauldrons and then
delivering them to the staircases. However, blocking your
way stands a mind-mangling array o f puzzles with the
monsters featuring at the top of the list.
Monsters are killed whenever they are trapped ami turn
into incredibly convenient skeletons that can be added to
your store to make more soap. That may sound simple but
juggling the joystick movements required to trap a monster
is far from easy and involves strategy, tactics, a lot of trial
and error and glooks!
Glooks are round purple blobs, with two sullen eyes and
a bad spiky haircut that spend most of the game being
pushed around (by you) when they frown in disgust. Glooks
don't move very much but they do ﬂoat towards the smell of
G A ME  O F  T H E  M O N T H
bathing monsters, and since this is determined by the
direction of the last staircase you delivered soap to, you have
limited, but important, control over the garne's glooks. By
pushing glooks and anticipating the direction they will move
as you deliver soap to staircases you can trap monster's open
entrances to new pans o f the cavern but can also trap
yourself and Fozzy. If you trap yourself then your only way
out is to sacriﬁce one of your ﬁve lives to restart from the last
soap delivery, if Fozzy is trapped then his energy plummets
and he loses one o f his three lives. Fozzy may not be
important in the early levels but later in the game is
immunity to  monsters and his ability to grab them is
invaluable as it either allows you to push a glook onto a
collared monster to trap and kill or simply to get past alive.
Spiders are a  little trickier as although Fozzy is
invulnerable to their touch he can't grab them, neither can
they be killed and to make things worse, a spider will eat any
skeletons i t can which could cost you the game. N o
skeletons, no soap I'm afraid. Luckily, i f you keep your
mind in gear you shouldn't run into too many troubles since
spiders always cling to the left hand wall and so you can
predict their moves and even get them going around in
circles.
The early levels are relatively simple and if you look
before you leap you should be able to collect all the skeletons
you need to keep the bathing monsters in soap. However,
the game suddenly throws you in the deep end. There just
aren't enough skeletons so you have to set about making
some out of dead monsters.
However to move the glooks to kill the monster also
blocks crucial passageways trapping either you or Fozzy
and the few skeletons that are there are either buried in a
solid block of glooks in a locked room or you have to run the
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
90
gauntlet of spiders to reach them. To make things worse you
KNOW there must be a solution! Then, just when you're so
annoyed that the GA's about to ﬂy across the room you try
one more plan. ludicrous it may sound, it might just work. It
doesn't, but you're hooked again.
A few hours, days or weeks later you'll ﬁnally solve it
and the whole process starts again. At the end of each level
the game gives you a password that you can type in as a
shortcut through the levels you've already completed.
However, you may ﬁnd it useful to practise these conquered
levels occasionally as to win,the personal stereo you have to
complete all 22 caverns in a single game!
Bone Cruncher will be compared to Superior's own
Repton series and other Boulder Dash style games.
Although it is set in a series of caverns in which the hero digs
out dirt to collect skeletons or diamonds other game elements
such as Fozzy, the glooks and the way you must turn
monsters into skeletons creates a game that is out on its own.
Add functional but funny graphics (such as the Glooks
grimace when you shove them or Bono scratching himself
while he's waiting for you to work out your next move), a
catchy tune and digital speech introduction and you have a
game that you must not miss.

unfortunately s till suffers fr om a n
acuate shortage of software compared
with its more successful predecessor.
the Commodore 64. This is certainly
true in the area of utilities, although to
be fair, the Plus/4 does come equipped
with a  pretty good, although basic
machine language monitor (MLM).
The program I  have written is a
two-pass symbolic assembler which is
disk-based, i.e. it reads its source code
from a  dis k  ﬁle  a n d  writes t h e
assembled code to another disk ﬁle.
The source ﬁle is assumed to have an
MSDOS-type ﬁle extension . A M .
The rununit (assembled code) has lie,
extension .EXE. For  example, when
the program runs, it asks the user for a
ﬁlename. I f  you enter PROG I and
press return, the program will assume
that t h e  s our c e ﬁl e  i s  c a lle d
PROGLASM a n d  w ill produce a
rununit with the name FROG I .EXE.
The load address of the rununit is
the address given i n  the assembler
directive O R G  (code origin). Y o u
should therefore ensure t h a t  t h e
correct address is given here. The code
address defaults t o  S0000 i n  t h e
absence of the ORG directive. When
assembled, the rununit is loaded by
either the MLM I  command or be a
BASIC L O A D  w it h  a  secondary
address of I.

assembler, fairly large source code ﬁles

may be used. The Plus/4 allows about
60K of BASIC. Thus the same amount
is available to source code programs
since the normal BASIC editor is used
to prepare programs.
Getting it all in
The program is presented as a BASIC
loader w i t h  l o t s  ( ! )  o f  D A T A
statements. Eac h l i n e  i s  checked
against the checksum value but it's still
a good idea to make use of the Your
Commodore loader program. Should a
problem occur, the line where the fault
was detected will be printed. Before
typing in the program, you will have to
move the start of BASIC upwards in
memory by 4K, Type in the following
direct command;
POKE 8192,0:PO KE 43,1:PO KE
44,32:NEW
This moves BASIC up to 8192 in
memory. I f  y ou are typing in  the
program i n  s tages , y o u  m u s t
remember to type this in every time
before you start.
When the program has been typed
in, SAVE it ﬁrst then RUN it. If all is
well, the program w ill be built in
memory and SAVED to disk.
Reset the machine then load the
new program. The assembler has been
designed to LO AD and RUN like a
BASIC program at the normal BASIC
start address ($1001 I and will return to
BASIC when assembly stops. You are

happens then the line in which the
error occurred is printed along with an
error message.
During Pass 2, a  full listing is

shown AF T ER the line in which it
occurred and assembly stops.

(things w o u ld  never h e the same

Normally, the Commodore line editor
tries to tokenise anything in the input
line which looks like a BASIC reserved
word, As certain assembly mnemonics
contain character sequences which
resemble BASIC commands, we have
to pr ev ent t h is  happening. T h e
program " ED I T "  is a small BASIC
loader with a machine-code program
in D A T A  statements. When i t  is
loaded and RUN, it causes a bypass of
the tokenisation routine for program
lines only. This  means that direct

Assembler Directives and Formats
There are six assembler directives:
BYT
EQA
RES
Assemble bytes to memory. This directive also allows text to be
entered. Typical examples are:
10 byt $93,'Hello CBM',$0d,$00
20 byt 23,24,$19,$la
WOR A s s e m b l e s  2-byte words to memory. Bytes are arranged in lo-byte,
hi-byte order.
10 wor $0071.32768.vectorl
20 vector! wor $3000
This example also shows how symbols may be inserted into WOR
and BYT directives.
EQZ T h e  eqz directive allows you to associate a symbol with a zero
page memory location. When referred to later, this symbol will
assemble in zero page addressing mode.
20 pointerl eqz $14
The equ directive allows you to associate a symbol with an
absolute memory location. When referred to later, this symbol will
assemble in absolute addressing mode.
40 .irqvector eqa $0314
50 .nrnivector eqa irqvector+2
The RES directive allows an area of memory to be set aside for a
table of some such thing. It simply adds the amount speciﬁed to
the assembly program counter.
IGO .table
110 res 100
120
ORG T h i s  directive sets the code origin in memory. Because the disk
system uses this to set the program load address, it is advisable to
use this as the ﬁrst line of any program.
10 org $6000
You may insert comments into a
source program using the semi-colon.
As you may have noticed above,
symbols are declared using a full stop.
When referred to later, only the name
need be given.
Assembly Language Formats
Immediate operands are assumed to be
preceeded b y  t h e  h a sh  ( #  ).
Hexadecimal numbers m a y  b e
preﬁxed with either the dollar o r
ampersand ($A). Ascii characters may
be inserted into something like LDA
# 'A'. This will load the ascii code
value of the letter A. Decimal numbers
have no preﬁx thus LDA 3 0  will
assemble to load the accumulator with
30.
As mentioned above, symbols
must be declared usinif, a full-stop, for
example:
10 org $7000
20 lomen=81001
30 .himen•=-
40 ;
50 Ida # < foment
60 Ids # < lomem
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
94
70 sta himem
stx himem+1
90 rts
In this example, you see that the
symbols a n d  m a y  be used to load
the lo-order or hi-order byte o f an
operand respectively. Also you may
add or subtract values as in line 80.
Note that i n  a  line such as L D A
# < memory+. the "memory+1
evaluated BEFORE the o p e ra to r
takes effect.

The Choice
of Modem
T
are the Kirk Enterprise I and the Pace
Series Four 1200S. Before describing
each modem i n  t u r n ,  it ' s  wor th
pointing out the hardware/software
that is  used with these modems, as
neither one was speciﬁcally designed
for use with the Commodore 64/128.
Kirk recommended the Mustang
64 Communications Cartridge (V2.1)
from Y2 Computing for use with the
Enterprise 1 modem. This item plugs
into the cartridge por t and offers
viewdata a n d  s c r olling ter minal
facilities. Howev er , because t h e
Enterprise I is equipped with a female
25 way D-type RS232 connector, it is
not essential that the modem be used
with the Y2 software.
Indeed. to test the 1200 baud half-
duplex capability of the Enterprise L I
interfaced the modem to the 64 via an
RS232 interface which plugs into the
user port of the 64/128. The software
used w i t h  t h e  in t e r f a c e  w a s
HomeTerm whic h i s  par t o f  the
Home Pack i  ntegra ted s u i t e  o f
software from Ariolasoft.
Basically the same applies with the
Series Four. It too is equipped with a
female RS232 connector, and can be
used w i t h  t h e  Y 2  cartridge. o r
connected to the 64/128 via an RS232
interface. F o r  the purpose o f  this
review. the Series Four 12.00S was
tested with both the Y2 software. as
well as HomeTerm.
P E R I P H E R A L  R E V I E W
There are a number of factors to be taken into
consideration when entering the world of
communications. Here we look at Iwo modems at
Opposite ends of the 'vice scale
By David Janda
Commodore Connection
This choice of connecting a modem to
the 64/1.28 is a little confusing. and
deserves f u r t h e r  e x p la n a t io n .
Cartridge software is Vel
this countiA. and because the major
control lines are supported on the
ea rt ridge por t ,  manufactures hav e
opted to put their comms software and
interfacing electronics i n t o  o n e
package —a cartridge. The Y2 Mustang
software is one example. however, the
cartridge in turn must be connected to
a modem.
The nex t stage fr om this  is  t o
incorporate a modem into the package
as well examples are the Commodore
modem and the Multi-modem from
Miracle Technology.
The alternative is to connect the
modem to the 64/128 via the user port.
To do this the user must purchase an
RS232 interface (which costs as little as
00) . T er minal s oftware w i l l  b e
required to 'drive' the RS232 interface.
hut this should not be a problem as
there a r e  doz ens  o f  t e r m in a l
programs i n  t h e  public  domain.
One example is Your Cr»mnothwe's
very own Telecom 64. which was listed
in the April 1986 issue. Connecting a
modem v i a  this  method has  t h e
advantage that the RS232 interface can
be used to dri e devices other than a
modem a  pr inter  o r  plotter  f o r
example. The main disadvantage is
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
96
that there is no viewdata software (that
1 know of) which operates through the
user port.
Enterprise 1
Probably the best way to describe the
Enterprise I  i s  t o  say that it's  a
Voyager 7  with bits added on. The
appearance a n d  func tionality  a r e
almost identical, and perhaps this is
not s o  s urpris ing a s  b o t h  t h e
Enterprise I  and the Voyager 7 were
manufactured by Kirk automation.
Appearance wise. the Enterpise I is
housed in a black casing with green
lettering on the front panel. A rotary
switch on the right is used to select the
required baud rate which can be one of
300/300 org/ans . 1200/ I '200 hall-
duplex. 1200/75. 75/1200 baud and
test; A  feature which is not on the
Voyager 7 is the one/off line button
which is used when dialing/answering
manually. An interesting oddity is that
pushing the button in will switch the
modem ofﬂine and out online. The
other way round would have been
more logical in my opinion.
At the rear of the modem is the
RS232 socket (female), phone socket,
telephone lead and power cable. O f
particular interest is the 21 pin RS232
connector. Looking inside the modem
reveals that pins 1-6, 15, 17, 20, 22-23
and 25 are in use. Basically this means
that connecting the Enterprise to your

Commodore should be no problem as
a variety of options are available. The
phone socket is recessed and allows a
telephone to be used in-line with the
modem which saves you the expense of
buying a splitter.
Using the Enterprise I proved to be
simplicity its elf, ev en though t h e
manual is  quite grotty. When used
with software such as Mustang from
Y2 Computing the auto-dial feature
can be used. The Enterprise series uses
boring old relay technology to auto-
dial, which is quite loud in operation
and not the most reliable method of
getting a telephone to dial, but what
can you expect for the price?
One aspect o f  the operation o f
Enterprise 1 that particularly annoyed
me was  the so-called auto-answer
facility which, more often than not, did
not work. I have had this problem with
several Voyager 7's, and I  can only
conclude that the problem is inherent
in the design of the modem.
I laving said this, all other aspects
of the modems operation were ﬁne.
and 1 would conclude that if you are
looking f o r  a  cheap ( but mos tly
reliable) modem w i t h  dual speed
operation, it would be a good idea to
shop around for an Enterprise
Series Four Range
The Series F our  range o f  modems
from Pace Micro Technology consists
of three models, and I looked at the
1200S, which is in the 'middle' of the
range.
What you get for the price (and the
price is quite a lot) is sophistication
P E R I P H E R A L  R E V I E W
with simplicity. Let me explain. The
Series Four is one of the new breed of
intelligent modems. That is, a lot of the
work that is  normally done by  the
micro/RS232 imerface/softwa re i s
done by the modem itself. The modem
has its  ow n control program and
central processing unit and is in effect a
computer in its own right. Operation
of the modem is done by sending it
cornmands H o r n  t h e  t e r m i n a l
software. These commands were
developed by the Hayes company and
are w idely  us ed thr oughout t h e
industry.
The 1200S model reviewed can
operate at 300/300, 1200/75, 75/1200
and 1200/1200 full-duplex. It features
auto-dial, auto-answer, auto-baud
rate detection/selection. Also included
is a battery backed clock/calandar and
the facility to store up to 64 phone
numbers i n  its  internal 'note@ad'
memory which is battery packed. The
1200S also features a full RS232 port
YOUR COMMODORE march 1988
97
with inline phone socket as well as a
Centronics pr int er  p o r t  a n d  2 0
segment led display with line strength
indicator and speed buffering.
The modem itself is quite ﬂat but
takes up a large footprint on our work
surface. The front panel consists of an
LCD display with two touch-sensitive
buttons (that are used t o  manually
select options) and the line status/line
strength LEDs . A t  the rear o f  the
modem is the power supply socket for
the PSU which is a separate unit, the
inline phone socket, the Centronics
port and the only button on the whole
machine: the reset switch.
Interfacing t h e  1200S t o  y our
Commodore i s  a ls o  v e r y  easy.
lowever, because t h e  modem i s
intelligent, i t  c a n  b e  us ed w i t h
practically any comms software you
care to name.
Simple Operation
Once connected t o  y our micro the
I200S is easy to operate. Due to the
way the modern is  wired up to the
micro the COITI MS software (such as
Mustang) will think that the modem is
online and go into terminal mode after
a few seconds. The reason for this is
that the commands t o  operate the
modem a r e  enter ed, fr om y o u r
keyboard while in terminal mode. To
understand this  better consider the
following e x a m p le :  u s i n g  t h e
Mustang cartridge connected t o the
Series Four I  would like to contact
Telecom G o ld  a t  1200 baud full-
duplex. I  would select the terminal
mode and to online by pressing return
(even though I was not online). At this
stage I would be greeted with a blank
screen, but by entering 'AT?' followed
by RETURN the Series Four help
Table I - ENTERPRISE I RS232 PIN OUTS

screen would be displaved (Table 2).
To enter Telecom Gold at 1200 lull-
duplex I  would simply enter the
following:
ATD 583 1200
The rest would be automatic with
the modem dialing, detecting the
answer, selectimg th e  appropriate
baud rate and so on. Even i f my
terminal software can only operate at
300/300 baud it is still possible to use
services that operate at 1200 baud full-
duplex because the Series Four has an
internal memory buffer that keeps
things in order. The ﬁnal result is that
the modem is very easy to use. and yet
extremel% powerful. Without a doubt.
the Series Four is the Rolls-Royce
among modems.

bait t o  lure prospective buyers i n to  acquiring the
Commodore 64C package. As with any mousetrap there is a
catch - once the mouse is plugged in. the keyboard responds
in a most peculiar way. In the real world mice are rarely
noticed and it would be good if their electronic counterparts
acted in a similar way.
With the Mouse Plus, Shazaan Systems offers a means of
fulﬁlling this dream b y  providing a  connector and
associated software which allows the mouse to be attached
to the user port instead of the joystick port. Connected in
this way the software can then set up the necessary interrupts
to allow the keyboard and mouse to he used in unison.
What's on the Disk
The disk provided with the adaptor/connector contains ﬁve
programs which adequately demonstrate the power of the
module. The ﬁrst program offers an Amiga style set of pull-
down menus, two of the others demonstrate the use of the
mouse and a fourth is a program which can be incorporated
in the user's own software.
The ﬁnal program on the disk is a Cheese modiﬁer which
unfortunately only appears to work in conjunction with the
disk version o f the original program. The MC package
incorporates the cassette version o f this mouse-driven
drawing program. After transferring the cassette version to
disk. I attempted to incorporate the modiﬁer but found it to
he a  fruitless experiment. Th e  Newcheese program
generated would not operate at all so I would like to see a
cassette modiﬁer included in future.
To return to the Amiga-style menu program, the master
menu names are displayed across the top line of the display
screen. By clicking onto one of these headings various useful
utility programs can be called from the revealed pull-down
menus,

centre of the screen so that speciﬁc program details can be
entered. When the operation has been completed. the
original screen is restored.
The printer options gives a screen dump. Basic program
printout and reset options. Utilities allows the recovery of a
'newed' program and the appending or merging of two
programs. Border. screen, cursor or mouse pointer colours
can be changed via the special menus option and the ﬁnal
menu simply displays the version date of the menu program
in use.
The instructions give full details on how this rudimentary
selection o f  utilities can be expanded with your own
programs. This means that i f  a  renumber utility is
considered essential to your programming needs you can
patch it into the menu system and then save the whole new
program to disk.
One of the ﬁrst utilities that I would like to add to this system
is an option to change the colour of the menu tabs. These are
displayed in dark blue so. i f this is also your favoured
background colour, the menu becomes invisible until you
MO VC the pointer onto one of the options.
The two mouse programs, Mouse! and its associated
demo, graphically. display the was in which the system can
be used to great effect in your own software and there is a
separate program. Mouse2, which has been created for your
own use.
The Mouse Plus package certainly offers vastly
improved and much needed control systems for the Neos
Mouse and turns a novelty into a practical device which will
enhance your software. Such value does not come cheaply
but for t 19.95 you not only get the disk and the connector
but also the freedom to leave your mouse permanently
connected and ready for use with suitable software,

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid,
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s  always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [SA I would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S-I-2] means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C+2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC4] o r, exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C3]
This would be achieved by holding

for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SSI,[C*]
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T1 will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine ke y
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one of these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PR INT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:

Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

Due to  the illness o f our software
evaluator some people ma y b e
experiencing a  delay i n  getting to
replies regarding si.•bmissions. We are
trying to clear the backlog of programs
as quickly as we can but this is taking
some time. This backlog also effects

We apologise for the delay and
would ask that you would bear with us
while the backlog is cleared.
The publication o f lifesavers has
also been halted because o f  this

soon as we can.
Puzzle
Corner
After a series of adventures, you have
made your way to the evil wizard's
treasure room. All that remains is to
make off with the loot!
The treasure is on an island in the
centre o f  an acid ﬁlled pool. The
distance between you and the island is
twelve feet. All you can ﬁnd to help
you are two planks but unfortunately,
they are both only ten feet long.
Can you still get the treasure and if
so, how? Diagrams should be sent to:

Commodore Where Are You?
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we are
repeatedly asked for the address and
telephone number o f  Commodore
U.K. Many people, after referring to
their computer manuals, believe them
to be based in Corby.
The Commodore plant at Corby
was closed down some time ago.
Reproduced here you will ﬁnd the
correct address for Commodore U.K.
We suggest that you write this
correct address in the front of your
computers manual f o r  fu tu r e
reference.
Commodore Business Machine, (UK ).
Commodore House,
The Switchback,
Gardner Road,
Maidenhead,
Berks SL6 7XA.
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we receive hundreds of letters from readers every
month_ We do try and answer each individually but sometimes this is impossible
due to pressure of work. If you have written to us and not received a personal
reply, we apologise for this but we cannot promise to reply to every item of mail
we receive. If you feel that your question or letter really needs an answer, then
inclusion of an s.a.e. will guarantee a reply, although this may still take time to
arrive.

Milton Bradley's compelling game is now available for computer.
Anticipate your friend's responses to the provocative questions, in
Scruples. Think carefully before answering the moral dilemma you are
posed, or turn the tables and give an opposite reply to the one expected!
Bluff and counter bluff will be needed, and beware, the other players (the
Jury) can challenge your honesty at any time.
The computer interpretation is ingenious and funny. Up to ten
people can play: all human, all computer, or any combination. There is a

TRAPPED - in a 1970's arcade machine! Every escape route is blocked by a wall of brightly
coloured bricks. Powerfully addictive, with 200k of digitized sound, IMPACT has 80 built in
screens plus 48 that you can design yourself as hard, as simple, as much fun as you like.
Hidden on each screen are special tokens—catch them if you can. Use them to buy one of nine
powerful weapons, or keep them until the end of the screen to score a bonus.
