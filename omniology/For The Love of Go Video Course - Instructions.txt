Introduction
Hello, and welcome to learning Go! It’s great to have you here.
What’s this?
This is a video course introducing the Go programming language, suitable
for complete beginners. It covers roughly the same material as the For
the Love of Go book, and while you don’t need the book in order to learn
Go from this course, you may find it helpful, as it goes into some topics in
a little more detail, and offers more goals and challenges for you to com‐
plete.
What you’ll need
You’ll need to install Go on your computer, if you don’t have it already (if
you can run the command go version without errors, you’re all set!)
Follow the instructions here to download and install Go:
• https://golang.org/dl/
You’ll also need at least Go version 1.16 to run the code examples in this
course. Run the following command to see what version of Go you have:
3

go version
go version go1.19 darwin/amd64
While all you need to write and run Go programs is a terminal and a text
editor, you’ll find it very helpful to use an editor that has specific support
for Go. For example, Visual Studio Code has excellent Go integration.
What you’ll learn
By working through this course and completing the goals, you’ll learn:
• How testing works in Go, and how to write code guided by tests
• How to deal with data in Go, including structs, slices, and maps
• How to use methods and pointers to create Go objects with beha‐
viour
• All about Go’s syntax and control structures, such as loops and state‐
ments
Prerequisites
You don’t need any prior knowledge of Go, or even any programming ex‐
perience of any kind. This course is designed for complete beginners
(though it should also be extremely useful to people who already have
some programming experience!)
How to use this course
Throughout the course we’ll be working together to develop programming
projects in Go. I’ll introduce each topic and show you some useful tech‐
niques or ideas, and there’ll be some practical goals for you to achieve,
such as writing a function or program. At these points I’ll prompt you to
pause the video and try to solve the goal yourself; if you get stuck, review
the video, or keep watching to get some helpful hints.
If you’re finding the goals easy, or want a bit more of a challenge, there
are some stretch goals, too, identified with the words STRETCH GOAL.
These are optional; if you’re not interested or not ready to tackle them,
just skip over them.
So let’s get started!

I’m not a global mega‐corporation, and I don’t have a publisher or a mar‐
keting budget: I write and produce these products myself, at home, in my
spare time. They’re priced very cheaply because I’m not doing this for
the money: I’m doing it so that I can help bring the love of Go to as many
people as possible.

Further reading
I’ve written a series of books on Go programming that cover more or less
the same material as this course. You may find them interesting and use‐
ful, especially as a way to review what you’ve learned in this course.
