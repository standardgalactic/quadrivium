Foreword
Mushroom Biotechnology – Developments and Applications focuses our attention on the highly diver-
sified attributes of a fascinating group of fungi whose contributions to economic and technological 
development have often been greatly under-estimated. The volume is edited by Professor Marian Petre, 
organizer in 2012 of the International School of Advanced Studies on Mushroom Biotechnology and 
Bioengineering at the University of Pitesti. Contributing authors are distinguished mushroom biolo-
gists who are all actively engaged in research at prestigious universities and research institutes world-
wide. Compiling a publication of this kind is a demanding and complicated exercise, and all concerned 
are to be congratulated on a highly successful outcome.
Mushrooms impact on human welfare in many ways. For centuries, edible varieties have been 
treasured for their high nutritive value and desirable organoleptic qualities. Over 60 species are now 
cultivated on a commercial scale, and this figure is increasing every year as more species are domes-
ticated. Also, the health-promoting properties of mushrooms have long been recognized in some cul-
tures, especially in China, although this perception has, until recently, largely depended on empirical 
observations. However, latter-day application of modern analytical techniques has identified various 
mushroom-derived compounds, polysaccharides and triterpenoids for example, which exhibit a wide 
range of medicinal properties including immuno-enhancing, anti-tumor, anti-viral and hypocholes-
terolemic activities. There is growing experimentally-based evidence to suggest that dietary supple-
ments based on bioactive compounds extracted from mushrooms (mushroom nutriceuticals) increase 
resistance to disease and, in some cases, cause regression of a diseased state. Mushroom cultivation 
also impacts positively on the environment since the lignocellulosic waste materials generally used as 
growth substrates are often disposed of using less environmentally-friendly methods. Moreover, the 
metabolic diversity of mushrooms is integral to bioremediation and biocontrol functions.
One important facet of mushroom biotechnology is focused on mushroom products obtained by 
fermentation or extraction from fruiting bodies, fungal mycelium, or spent culture liquor. It is this 
sector of the mushroom industry, currently estimated to be worth in excess of 20 billion US dollars 
annually, that is expanding most rapidly. Therefore, it is appropriate that two contributions to this book 
(Chapters 1 and 9) focus on fungal biomass production using fermenter-based systems. Depending 
upon the mushroom species, traditional mushroom cultivation periods can extend to several months, 
during which time microbial contamination and/or insect infestation may occur and adversely effect 
quality and yield. Production of bioactive mushroom metabolites through the controlled cultivation of 
fungal biomass in bioreactors, using both submerged and solid–state processes, allows system param-
eters to be easily and accurately manipulated to maximize product yields in the shortest time.
The two chapters on the use of winery and fruit tree wastes will appeal to the more entrepre-
neurial wine producer/fruit grower. Although some basic principles apply, mushroom cultivation does 
not necessarily require highly automated growth facilities and the heavy capital investment associated 
with Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom) production in Europe and North America. Low-
technology cultivation systems also have the potential to increase profit margins by generating an 
added-value cash crop from plentiful supplies of locally-available agricultural waste materials that 
would otherwise require cost-incurring disposal.
Major mushroom growing enterprises, especially those producing A. bisporus, are already using 
highly automated, computer-controlled systems. It will be interesting to see how long it takes for the 

xviii
Foreword
virtual robotic prototype for safe and efficient cultivation of mushrooms, introduced in Chapter 4, to 
become reality.
Since it is generally accepted that A. bisporus cultivation was first undertaken in France, it is per-
haps fitting that French researchers are associated with the two chapters in the book that are focused 
solely on “Le champignon.” The first emphasizes the role of the mushroom in sustainable agricultural 
development and the importance of conserving and improving germplasm resources. The second per-
tains to the major pathogens affecting the mushroom and the need to adopt environmentally-friendly 
solutions.
The chapter on sclerotium-forming mushrooms is a helpful addition to the relatively sparse litera-
ture describing this interesting group of fungi. Sclerotium-forming Pleurotus tuber-regium is economi-
cally important in Africa, both as a food and a medicine, while Inonotus obliquus (chaga mushroom) 
has a long history of use as a tonic and for the treatment of various ailments.
Mushrooms are non-photosynthetic and instead produce a battery of extracellular enzymes (e.g., 
cellulases, hemicellulases, and ligninases) in order to convert the lignocellulosic residues that nor-
mally serve as the growth substrate into products that can be assimilated for fungal nutrition. Although 
Aspergillus niger, the fungal subject of Chapter 10, is not a mushroom, it is feasible to extrapolate the 
methodology used to produce xylanases by this fungus to high xylanase-producing mushroom species.
The penultimate chapter describes the identification of mating type loci and genes in the straw 
mushroom, Volvariella volvacea, and the various techniques adopted for molecular marker–assisted 
breeding. The methodologies described are again generally applicable but this chapter will be of special 
interest to breeders and growers located in tropical and subtropical regions where the straw mushroom 
is widely cultivated.
Two other contributions are both concerned with “mycorestoration” – the use of fungi to restore 
degraded environments. Mushrooms as a source of various biocontrol agents are the subject of the 
former, while the latter describes the significance of fungal ligninolytic enzymes in the degradation of 
recalcitrant agro-pesticides (mycoremediation).
Mushroom Biotechnology – Developments and Applications covers a wide range of topics which 
highlight the versatility of mushrooms and their fundamental importance to the welfare of humankind. 
It will appeal to both specialists and non-specialists alike, and I am confident it will enjoy a wide read-
ership and provide a stimulus for future research.

Preface
Mushrooms are considered one of the most diversified groups of biological species adapted for living in 
extreme environmental conditions all over the Earth. For centuries, many mushroom species have been 
used as outstanding sources of food and medicine, but in the recent past humans have discovered some 
of their powerful features to clean the environment through the bioconversion of organic residues from 
the habitats where they live and continuous recycling of chemical elements.
Nevertheless, for humankind, there is as an urgent need to sustain the efforts to change the current 
status of serious crises in food, human health, and environmental pollution through the beneficial appli-
cations of mushroom biotechnology!
In this respect, a better understanding of the main interactions between biological, biophysical, and 
biochemical phenomena and processes involved in biotechnological applications of using mushrooms 
as one of the most important biologic tools for maintaining environmental health will be a key solution 
for the future progress of humanity.
Mushroom biotechnology is defined as a component discipline of mushroom biology applications 
including mushroom cultivation, mushrooms for biocontrol of phytopathogens, and mushrooms as 
bioremediation agents. In this respect, a new field of using mushrooms in cleansing organic and inor-
ganic wastes from the environment has been developed as mycoremediation.
The book Mushroom Biotechnology—Developments and Applications has been conceived as a syn-
thetic mirror of recent scientific achievements in the fields of controlled cultivation of culinary and 
medicinal mushrooms as organic sources of food and medicines, automatic cultivation and processing 
of mushrooms, biocontrol of pathogens and pests, improvement of mushroom breeding by genetic 
methods, as well as biodegradation of recalcitrant contaminants through the application of advanced 
mycological biotechnology.
The content is divided into 12 chapters, each of which provides detailed information regarding sci-
entific experiments carried out in various countries of the world to test novel applications designed to

1.1  INTRODUCTION
From the beginning of this century, the submerged cultivation of culinary and medicinal mushrooms 
has received a great deal of attention as a promising and reproducible alternative for the efficient pro-
duction of mycelia biomass and fungal metabolites. Due to economic reasons, the submerged cul-
tivation of mushrooms (SCM) has gained an ascending attention due to its significant potential for 
industrial applications, but its prospective success on a commercial scale depends on increasing prod-
uct yields and development of novel production systems that address the problems associated with this 
biotechnology of mushroom cultivation.
In the recent literature, there are described several methods of growing strains of Basidiomycetes in 
submerged cultures, which provide an opportunity to get a huge production of biomass containing high 
concentrations of bioactive compounds with healthful effects on humans, such as proteins, essential 
amino acids, vitamins, and polysaccharides (Verstraete and Top, 1992; Smith, 1998; Stamets, 2000; 
Sanchez, 2004; Wasser, 2010).
Any technology for bioprocessing raw materials or their constituents into bioproducts requires the 
following three steps: process design, system optimization, and model development. To achieve all 
these steps, a biotechnological proceeding involves the use of biocatalysts, as whole microorganisms 
or their enzymes, to synthesize or bioconvert raw materials into new and useful products. At the same 
time, optimization of any submerged cultivation bioprocess is essential for biotechnology development 
in an industrial-scale application. In this respect, it should be taken into consideration that physical 
and chemical factors interact and affect the efficacy of the bioprocess regarding mycelia growth within 
the liquid medium. However, for the time being, in spite of research into optimizing the production 
of bioactive metabolites by synthesis by mushrooms, the physiological and engineering aspects of 
all submerged cultures are still far from being thoroughly studied (Wood, 1992; Wedde et al., 1999; 
Elisashvili, 2012).

Chapter 1  BIOTECHNOLOGY OF MUSHROOM GROWTH
1.2  THE CONCEPT OF SCM
First of all, it is necessary to point out that the SCM has an exclusive and specific character concerning 
fungal cell growth and development in totally different conditions compared with the natural environ-
ment where all native mushrooms exist.
This means that the concept of SCM refers to a biotechnological process of mushroom growth 
inside an artificial environment represented by the volume of a liquid medium in which all physical 
and chemical factors needed for optimal development of mycelium are provided without any risk of 
chemical or biological contamination.
The specific status of all mushroom species as native or indigenous fungi is to grow and develop 
in natural habitats in terrestrial ecosystems; in other words, they are species adapted to colonize only  
solid substrates containing a certain amount of water and involving living organisms or organic struc-
tures accumulated outside or inside the soil (Vournakis and Runstadler, 1989; Wedde et al., 1999; 
Uphoff, 2002).
More precisely, no known mushroom species has any capability of growing and developing in 
natural aquatic habitats; more than that, none of them is adapted to form fruiting bodies inside a liquid 
medium. This is a restrictive living condition for all native mushroom species of planet Earth, by which 
they are compelled to live only inside terrestrial ecosystems from the natural environment due to their 
strictly specific adaptation to aerobic respiration.
The cellular metabolic processes of any mushroom species require permanent oxygen intake in 
appropriate concentrations, supplied from the outer environment of the mycelia, and this cannot be 
achieved inside a liquid volume of any natural environment where there does not exist the proper con-
centration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in order to maintain the mushroom’s life!
Mushroom species have great potential for adapting to any habitat which provides a solid support 
and containing only a small amount of water to sustain their natural life cycle. If this support is entirely 
formed by water, there is no chance for a mushroom strain to survive due to the lack of DO intake to the 
membrane surface of fungal cells. In such circumstances, the only way to artificially grow mushroom 
species inside a liquid medium is to keep the dissolved oxygen concentrations (DOC) at required levels 
to maintain the mushroom’s metabolic activities by using special devices to force oxygen penetration 
inside the liquid volume.
Thus, despite both the shear forces and turbulence generated by oxygen intake inside the liquid 
cultivation medium from the culture vessel of a bioreactor, the mycelium is forced to move circularly 
according to the specific rheology of such a medium. During the cultivation process, the fungal cells are 
able to grow in submerged conditions and, due to centrifugal force, these cells metabolize the nutritive 
particles from the cultivation medium and develop as a biomass containing many mycelium pellets of 
different sizes and almost rounded shapes.
1.3  METHODS AND TECHNIQUES USED FOR SCM
As a general matter, SCM requires full control of the cultivation bioprocess regarding the automatic 
tracking of all chemical and physical parameters and keeping them at optimal values.

3
1.3  Methods and Techniques used for SCM
This biotechnological method permits fully standardized production of the fungal biomass with 
high nutritional value or the biosynthesis of mushroom metabolites with a predictable composition. 
At the same time, the downstream processing after submerged cultivation is very feasible and easier 
to carry out as compared with the classical procedure of solid-state cultivation. Inside the cultivation 
vessel of a bioreactor, it is possible to control the culture conditions, such as temperature, agitation, 
DOC, temperature, substrate and metabolite concentration, as well as the pH inside the liquid culture 
substrate (Kim et al., 2007; Elisashvili, 2012; Turlo, 2014; Homolka, 2014).
It is well known that the morphology of mycelia in submerged cultures has a significant influence 
on the rheology of the culture broth. At the same time, the initial viscosity of the liquid medium, as well 
as the stirring speed and air intake pressure, have important effects on fungal pellet formation during 
the cultivation cycle of mushroom spawn. Thus, the agitation rate and dispersion effect induced by 
shear forces upon the fragile structure of the mycelium, especially in the first period of time during a 
cultivation process, have determinant influence upon the fragile structure of the mycelium which is to 
develop inside the liquid culture medium as fungal pellets with different shapes and sizes. After many 
experiments to study the effects of stirring rate and share forces, it was noticed that an inverse rela-
tionship exists between agitation speed and pellet features. In fact, increased agitation determines the 
formation of small and very compact pellets; on the other hand, a vigorous agitation seems to prevent 
pellet formation (Park et al., 2001; Papagianni, 2004; Turlo, 2014).
Along the evolution of submerged cultures, the mushroom mycelia generate globular shaped aggre-
gates called pellets. The morphological forms of pellets are characteristic of each mushroom species. 
In any submerged culture, the pellet size determines the oxygen and nutrient transport into its center. In 
the core region of a large pellet, the fungal cells stop their growth because of low DOC and nutrients, 
and for this reason the smaller pellet diameter could be advantageous in terms of increased mycelia 
biomass (Lee et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2007; Elisashvili et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2011; Turlo, 2014).
However, pellet size is influenced by various variables, such as agitation regime, density of the 
inoculums, and sugar concentration in the culture medium (Petre et al., 2010).
During the cultivation process, the culture viscosity increases significantly, and sometimes, mush-
room mycelia start to wrap around impellers, spreading into the sampling devices and feed tubing with 
nutrients, causing functional blockages. All these problems limit the operation time of bioreactors, 
and they must be avoided by constant control and correction of the culture density (Shih et al., 2008; 
Elisashvili, 2012; Turlo, 2014).
While the SCM mycelia induce relatively high energy costs required for agitation, oxygen supply, 
and constant control of the temperature of the liquid medium during the whole cultivation process, this 
biotechnological method has significant industrial potential due to the possibility of process upscaling 
and operation of large-scale bioreactors.
There are many biotechnological methods for cultivating the mycelia of edible mushrooms in liquid 
media by applying various strategies. In this respect, batch culture is one of the most frequently used 
biotechnological methods for the SCM. In this cultivation method, no fresh nutritive elements are added 
to the culture composition and no end products of fungal metabolism are discharged during the process.
The simplest technique used for this kind of cultivation is based on shake flask cultures in order to get 
relatively small quantities of mycelia that can be used as inocula for the larger production of mycelia bio-
mass by growing in the culture vessels of laboratory-scale bioreactors designed for batch cultures (Porras-
Arboleda et al., 2009; Lin, 2010; Xu et al., 2011; Elisashvili, 2012; Petre and Petre, 2013; Homolka, 2014).

1.4  BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR SUBMERGED CULTIVATION OF PLEUROTUS 
OSTREATUS AND LENTINULA EDODES
The main problem that needs to be solved for the intensive biotechnological process of submerged cul-
tivation of edible and medicinal mushrooms on nutrient substrates made of agricultural wastes result-
ing from cereal grain processing is to convert these natural waste products of organic agriculture into 
nutritive biomass to be used as food supplements that are made only through biological means (Petre 
et al., 2014a; Petre and Petre, 2013).
In our recent studies on the application of laboratory-scale biotechnology for submerged cultivation 
of culinary mushrooms, we tested two Basidiomycetes species, described in the following lines.
Lentinula edodes (Berkeley) Pegler is a heterothallic mushroom species belonging to Basidiomycetes 
group. The optimum temperature for spore germination is 22–25°C, but for mycelial growth tempera-
ture can range from 5°C to 35°C. The species of the genus Lentinula can grow on various culture media, 
both natural and synthetic, depending on the cultivation procedure, and they have certain morphologi-
cal and physiological characteristics that distinguish them from other types of mushrooms (Carlile and 
Watkinson, 1994; Hawksworth et al., 1995; Jones, 1995; Hobbs, 1995).
Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacquin ex Fries) Kummer, also known by its popular name as the oyster mush-
room, is a Basidiomycetes species belonging to the family Pleurotaceae (Agaricales, Agaricomycetes). 
The species have carpophores with eccentric pileus and decurente blades showing white or hyaline 
enhanced with cylindrical or oval forms (Chahal and Hachey, 1990; Carlile and Watkinson, 1994; 
Hawksworth et al., 1995).
The pure cultures of these mushroom species, which were tested in our experiments, are represented 
by two strains, L. edodes LE 07 and P. ostreatus PO 14, belonging to the mushroom collection of the 
University of Pitesti.
Before starting the application of submerged mushroom cultivation, the pure mycelial cultures 
were inoculated into 250-mL flasks containing 100 mL of MEYE (malt extract 20%, yeast extract 
2%) medium, and then they were placed in a rotary shaker incubator set to keep the temperature level 
at 23°C with a stirring speed of 110 rpm (rotations per minute) for 5–7 days. Then the fungal cultures 
were placed by aseptic inoculation inside the bioreactor vessel for submerged cultivation.
The main stages of biotechnology to get high nutritive mycelial biomass by controlled submerged 
fermentation are as follows: (i) preparation of culture substrates, (ii) steam sterilization of the bioreac-
tor culture vessel, (iii) aseptic inoculation of sterilized culture media with the pure cultures of selected 
mushroom strains, (iv) running the submerged cultivation cycles under controlled conditions, and (v) 
collecting, washing, and filtering the fungal pellets that were obtained.
Such cellulosic wastes as apple marc and winery wastes were chosen as the main components of 
mushroom cultivation substrates; these were mixed with cereal bran, such as wheat, barley, and oats, 
which were weighed before mixing with limestone powder and tap water in different ratios, as shown 
in Table 1.1.
The first stage of biotechnology for submerged cultivation of P. ostreatus and L. edodes was achieved 
by preparation of culture substrates represented by agricultural wastes resulting from industrial pro-
cessing of cereal grains (wheat bran, barley bran, oat bran) and apple and winery wastes (grape marc 
and apple marc), with pure water (in the composition shown in Table 1.1), which were then poured into 
the cultivation vessel of the bioreactor.

1.4  BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR SUBMERGED CULTIVATION
In the next stage, steam sterilization of the bioreactor vessel containing the culture substrates was 
performed at 121°C and 1.1 atm. for 30 min. The third stage was aseptic inoculation of the sterilized 
culture media with pure cultures of selected mushroom strains inside the bioreactor vessel, using a 
sterile air hood with laminar flow.
In the next stage, the submerged cultivation cycles were carried out under controlled conditions: 
temperature 23 ± 2°C, stirring speed 70 rpm, and dissolved oxygen tension of 25–35%. Finally, the 
last step was accomplished by collecting, washing, and filtering the fungal pellets obtained by the sub-
merged fermentation of substrates made of by-products resulting from cereal grains processing (Petre 
and Petre, 2008; Petre and Petre, 2012).
The biotechnological experiments inside the bioreactor vessel were conducted under the follow-
ing conditions: temperature, 25°C; stirring speed, 120–180 rpm; dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) of 
35%, and an initial pH of 4.5–5.5. After 10–12 days of cultivation, the mycelial pellets were collected 
from the bioreactor vessel where they were formed, having various shape and size characteristics. All 
experiments were carried out in three replicates. Then we proceeded to filtration and concentration of 
the fungal pellets dispersed inside the cultivation vessel to get a pure and fresh mycelial biomass, as 
can be seen in Figure 1.1A and B.
At the end of the fermentation process in submerged conditions, we obtained a mushroom biomass 
with a brownish color, composed of mycelial formations consisting of compact and spherical anasto-
mosed hyphae that were concentrically distributed in their internal structure. Finally, the fungal pellets 
that were collected from the cultivation vessels were chemically analyzed for the percentage of dry 
matter, sugar content, Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total protein, as shown in Table 1.2.
The experiments were carried out three times for each mushroom species and substrate variant. The 
reported results are the means of the three repeated experiments. Samples for analysis were collected 
at the end of the submerged cultivation process, when mycelia pellets took on specific shapes and 
characteristic sizes. The mycelia biomass was washed repeatedly with double distilled water in a sieve 
with a 2 mm diameter eye to remove the remained bran in each culture medium. Biochemical analyses 
of mycelia biomass samples obtained through SCM were carried out for the solid fractions after their 
separation from the remaining fluid by pressing and filtering. In each experimental variant, the amount 
of fresh biomass mycelia was determined. Percentage of dry biomass was determined by dehydration 
obtained at a temperature of 70°C until constant weight was obtained.
The total protein content was determined by a biuret method, whose principle is similar to the 
Lowry method, this method being recommended for protein content ranging from 0.5 to 20 mg/100 mg

1.5  Physical and Chemical Factors That Influence the SCM
sample (Raaska, 1990; Park et al., 2001; Sanchez, 2010; Shih et al., 2008). This method requires 
only one sample incubation period for 20 min. In this way, interference from various chemical agents 
(e.g., ammonium salts) is eliminated. The principal method is based on the reaction that takes place 
between copper salts and compounds with two or more peptides, which results in a red-purple complex 
whose absorbance is read in the visible domain (λ = 550 nm) of a spectrophotometer. Using the Dubois 
method (1956), the sugar content of dried mycelia pellets collected after the biotechnological experi-
ments was determined (Petre and Petre, 2008; Papaspyridi et al., 2012).
Of the two mushroom species which were tested during the biotechnological experiments, L. edodes 
cultivated on substrate variant II showed the best value of sugar content; the next best, in order, was 
L. edodes in culture variant III, and P. ostreatus in culture variant III could be mentioned. Regarding 
Kjeldahl nitrogen, most favorable amounts were registered in the case of P. ostreatus cultivated on sub-
strate variant V, followed by L. edodes cultivated on substrate variant II and also by P. ostreatus on sub-
strate I. Total protein content was the greatest in the case of P. ostreatus cultivated on substrate variant 
I, followed by the same species cultivated on substrate variant II and L. edodes cultivated on substrate 
variant V. However, the registered results concerning sugar and total nitrogen contents showed higher 
values than those obtained by other researchers (Beguin and Aubert, 1994; Carlile and Watkinson, 
1994; Moo-Young, 1993; Confortin et al., 2008; Lin and Yang, 2006; Kim et al., 2004).
As a matter of fact, the nitrogen and protein contents of mycelia biomass represent key factors for 
assessing its nutritive potential, but the assessment of different protein nitrogen compounds requires 
additional investigation. Comparing all registered data, it can be noticed that the correlation between 
the dry weight of mycelia pellets and their protein, sugar, and nitrogen content is kept at a balanced 
ratio, as in the case of the fungal pellets of each tested mushroom species, as mentioned in a few scien-
tific works (Park et al., 2001; Papagianni, 2004; Shih et al., 2008; Papaspyridi et al., 2012).
The optimization of any submerged cultivation bioprocess is essential for biotechnology devel-
opment in an industrial-scale application. In this respect, it should be taken into consideration that 
the physical and chemical factors interact and affect the efficacy of the bioprocess regarding mycelia 
growth inside the liquid medium. One of the best methods to optimize the culture medium composi-
tion and physical culture parameters involves the changing of one independent parameter (physical or 
chemical) while keeping the other factors constant.
Such a method allows one to determine the optimal parameter (e.g., carbon or nitrogen sources) 
but it does not provide information on interactions and correlations between parameters. The most 
appropriate way is to use statistical techniques that permit the simultaneous optimization of multi-
ple factors, thereby obtaining considerable quantitative information by only a few experimental trials 
(Subramaniyam and Vimala, 2012; Turlo, 2014).
1.5  PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE SCM
The physicochemical characteristics of the submerged cultivation process may influence cell growth 
and, consequently, the number of viable cells per unit volume of cultivation media. These factors 
include temperature, pH index, the availability of oxygen (aeration), stirring, and inoculum quantity. 
The optimal timing for adding fresh nutritive medium in the case of batch cultivation is determined 
by the enzyme amount divided by the number of viable cells existing in the culture medium (Chahal, 
1994; Bae et al., 2000).

8
Chapter 1  BIOTECHNOLOGY OF MUSHROOM GROWTH
Usually, the ideal moment to add fresh culture medium in the cell culture is in the course of the expo-
nential growth phase, especially toward the middle or end of it, ensuring in this way the exposure of the 
cells growing on the contact surface of recently added substrate (Glazebrook et al., 1992; Zarnea, 1984).
1.5.1  CHEMICAL FACTORS
In the establishment of any biotechnological application, the most important key factors that must be 
taken into consideration are the chemical factors, because these could influence the running of bio-
processes to the highest degree.
1.5.1.1  Carbon sources
The carbon sources, particularly important due to the inducible characteristics of cellulases, must be 
accessible and at competitive manufacturing costs; this will result in a major production of enzymes. 
To select the optimal carbon source in order to increase the cellulose production of P. ostreatus, the 
strain PO 14 was grown on nutrient media containing soluble sugars (maltose, glucose, and xylose) in 
concentration ranging from 3% to 15%. The amount of soluble sugars determined in the fluid culture 
did not inhibit the total cellulose production of the P. ostreatus strain (van den Twell et al., 1994; Zhang 
and Cheung, 2011).
In order to achieve certain experiments regarding the biodegradation of cellulose constituents by 
cultivating P. ostreatus in a batch system, we tested different carbon sources in the form of suspensions 
in a concentration of 5–10 g% dry matter (d.m.), and a pure cellulose solution (Schuhardt) was used as 
the control. Monitoring the enzyme biosynthesis intensity, there were results that showed much higher 
values of enzymatic activity in the case of using natural carbon sources, represented by wastes resulting 
from industrial processing of cereal grains rather than the ones belonging to the control. In this respect, 
depending on the concentration of natural agricultural wastes, the cultivation substrates can be clas-
sified into the following categories: solid substrates (80–90 g% d.m.), semisolid substrates with high 
viscosity (30–40 g% d.m.), and colloidal suspension (5–10 g% d.m.).
There are many mushroom species that develop on cultivation substrates made of carbohydrates. 
It was noticed that fungal growth in media containing polysaccharides, such as starch, is much slower, 
since the depolymerization reaction of the carbohydrate compound was a limiting factor in the dynamic 
of cell growth process. As a result, the mushroom grew much faster on the equivalent substrate con-
sisting of a single monosaccharide (Beguin, 1990; Petre et al., 2010). The results showed a direct cor-
relation between particle size of cultivation substrate and the final amount of fungal biomass, which is 
explained by the influence of the ratio of volume/surface conversion during the dynamic biochemical 
processes of submerged cultivation.
1.5.1.2  Nitrogen sources
When the nitrogen sources were tested in experimental work, some of them (e.g., yeast extracts, malt 
extracts, peptones, triptones) did not provide nitrogen molecules which were specifically accessible 
to the cells, but they had provided vitamins and essential minerals for the proper development of the 
mushroom species used in certain cycles of cultivation.
For many mushroom species, these organic compounds may be used as combined sources of carbon 
and nitrogen at the same time. The nitrogen source capable of inducing the synthesis of cellulases at the 

9
1.5  Physical and Chemical Factors That Influence the SCM
optimum level during the cultivation of P. ostreatus strain PO 14 was determined by assaying organic 
(urea, yeast extract, peptone) or inorganic (ammonium nitrate, nitrite potassium) compounds, and the 
total amount of nitrogen registered in the culture fluid was 0.5 g/L. This demonstrated a need for the 
presence of organic compounds such as urea, peptone, yeast, or meat extracts and inorganic salts such 
as ammonium nitrate, as preferred sources of nitrogen to produce cellulolytic enzymes (Tanaka and 
Matsuno, 1985; Songulashvili et al., 2005).
Regarding the influence of some nitrogen sources upon the level of enzyme activity of cellulolytic 
fungi, a series of experimental tests were carried out using inorganic sources, such as ammonium 
nitrate in concentrations of 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.5%, and 1%. The stimulating effects on the cel-
lulolytic enzyme biosynthesis, such as endoglucanase in batch cultures of L. edodes and P. ostreatus 
mushrooms, were registered at ammonium nitrate concentrations of 0.5% and 1%, respectively. The 
highest enzyme activities were recorded in terms of using a mixture of beef extract, peptone, and inor-
ganic salts such as ammonium nitrate or potassium nitrate. In each case, the enzyme activity, dosed in 
the culture supernatants, reached the maximum values (Zarnea, 1994; Cohen et al., 2002).
1.5.1.3  pH index
The influence of pH values upon the selected substrates for edible mushroom cultivation has been  
studied in a relatively broad range of variation, between 3.0 and 7.5 pH. For the mushroom species of  
L. edodes and P. ostreatus, the maximum cellulase activity was registered at an initial pH of 5.5–6.0. 
The highest values of enzymatic activities during the cultivation cycle of the mentioned mushrooms 
were registered between 2.80 and 3.70 U/mL.
Adjusting the pH index to 5.5 during the whole cycle of submerged cultivation of the PO 14 strain, 
an increase in enzyme activity of this species of approximately 20–23% was registered compared with 
the uncorrected pH variant of blank. Thus, the variation of pH from 4 to 7 units resulted in a decrease 
of endoglucanase activity of the L.E.07 strain of 30–40% compared to the blank, which was maintained 
under standard conditions at a pH value of 7.0. Other results registered during cultivation cycles ranged 
from 2.80 to 3.70 U/mL, such variation being dependent on the time consumed from the beginning of 
mushroom growth. The results confirm the data from the literature, according to which the production 
of cellulase by the fungal strains is carried out in a weakly acidic pH range (Finkelstein and Ball, 1992; 
Gregg and Saddler, 1996).
1.5.1.4  Oxygen intake
Fungi in general are strictly aerobic microorganisms, and therefore, aeration is an extremely important 
factor in the development of metabolic processes. Experiments conducted under certain conditions, 
with different average values of surface/volume ratio (S/V), had provided relevant data on the sensi-
tivity of oyster mushroom strains depending on the air flow, as well as about how proper is the actual 
implementation of its uniform dispersion throughout the mass of nutrient medium (Mikiashvili et al., 
2006).
Concerning the mycelial growth of P. ostreatus in a batch cultivation system, a significant increase 
was determined in the amounts of dried protein biomass at levels that ranged from 15.9 to 23.8 g% d.m., 
registering a difference of 8.9 to 15.5 g% d.m., compared to the blank represented by the same species 
grown in a cultivation system without aeration, as compared to the initial protein content, which regis-
tered between 2.1 and 4.0 g% d.m.

Chapter 1  BIOTECHNOLOGY OF MUSHROOM GROWTH
It is worth pointing out that at flow rates of the air volume at 5 and 10 m3/h, the differences are 
negligible, which shows that an additional air intake (over 5 m3/h) has no significant influence on the 
metabolic activity of cultivated mushrooms. The registered data showed that the maximum levels of 
mycelial biomass belonging to PO 14 (15.35 g/L) and LE 07 (14.20 g/L) were noticed at aeration rates 
of 0.5 and 1.5 vvm, respectively. Also, the biometric analysis of mycelial morphology showed that 
mycelia formed fungal pellets even in the early stages of culture. Subsequently, during submerged 
cultivation the fungal pellets increased in their sizes.
In addition to these results, when the same species were grown in a chemostat-based system, an 
increase in the yield protein biomass conversion process was reflected in the final composition of myce-
lia biomass, which registered between 14.5 and 15.9 g% d.m., versus the initial content of 2.0–4.0 g% 
d.m. at the beginning of the cultivation cycle. The optimal specific growth of mycelia biomass was 
significantly enhanced, from 3.50 to 7.30 g/L, when the aeration rate increased from 0.5 to 1.5 vvm, but 
it dropped to 5.10 g/L at an aeration rate of 1.7 vvm. Finally, it was established that the optimal aeration 
rate is between 0.7 and 1.2 vvm.
1.5.2  PHYSICAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE SCM
1.5.2.1  Temperature
In a biosynthetic process, the temperature factor is of exceptional importance, as this parameter 
increases in its optimum value affecting the specific growth rate, according to the Arrhenius relation-
ship. Experiments relating to the monitoring of temperature, to see how they influence enzymatic activ-
ity when the value of this biochemical parameter is different from that required for adequate cell growth, 
have been performed mainly by cultivation of L. edodes. The intensity of L. edodes enzyme activities 
was determined for temperatures in the range of 10–30°C, under conditions of stationary cultivation on 
Mandels and Sternberg medium with cellulose 1%; a variation was noted in the range of 0.9–2.50 U/mL, 
the maximum activity being recorded at 23°C, while under a stirring regime it ranged between 1.50 and 
4.50 U/mL, with a maximum at a temperature of 28°C. Experiments around the effect of temperature on 
the stationary cultivation of L. edodes have revealed a decrease in enzymatic activity of about 30–40% 
compared with those results obtained by cultivation under a stirring regime. This highlighted the posi-
tive impact that was exercised by the stirring process, in close correlation with the carbon source, as 
well as its state of dispersion inside the culture medium (Jiang, 2010; Petre et al., 2014a).
1.5.2.2  Fragmentation degree of cultivation substrates
Increasing the degree of fragmentation of cellulosic materials used for submerged cultivation of several 
species of mushrooms is directly proportional to the extension of contact surfaces of cellulolytic enzymes. 
Mechanical fragmentation at dimensions of microns ensured an enhanced enzymatic activity by increas-
ing the coefficient of adhesion of the particles to the substrate on the external surface of the cell walls of 
hyphae from the mycelium structure (Leahy and Colwell, 1990; Frankland, 1992; Howard et al., 2003).
1.5.2.3  Stirring rate
The method of achieving a uniform dispersion of nutrient compounds contained in a cultivation liquid 
substrate demonstrated the important role of using a stirring regime, properly adapted to the morpho-
physiological requirements of fungal cultures (Glazebrook et  al., 1992; Davitashvili et  al., 2008). 
Without a controlled stirring regime, significant changes in the intensity of cellular metabolic activity 

11
1.7  NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR SUBMERGED CO-CULTIVATION
were noticed, particularly as a result of the emergence of some areas deficient in nutrients, while there 
were others that kept their concentration within appropriate limits. These disturbances with entropic 
effects on the fungal microhabitat were caused by an improper stirring regime, which may occur when 
certain shear forces are generated due to the swirling effects that occur in the area adjacent to the impel-
ler blades. In certain experiments, the intensity of such effects increased exponentially, as the optimal 
rheology of the cultivation medium decreased during the development of fungal biomass (Carlile and 
Watkinson, 1994; Cocker, 1980).
Data recorded during the experiments regarding simulation of growing cycles under various stir-
ring speeds demonstrated that each of the species tested in cultures needed a certain stirring regime, 
through a well-defined number of rotations per minute, allowing optimal deployment of morphogenesis 
processes, and eliminating the risk of cell damage (Petre et al., 2010).
1.6  THE BIOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE SCM
Many species of Basidiomycetes mushrooms produce extracellular enzymes that give them the abil-
ity to break down polysaccharides such as pulps and convert these organic compounds into polymeric 
carbohydrates and other low molecular weight substances. The metabolic characteristics of cellulolytic 
fungi require the use of a cell culture with high enzymatic potential (Beguin and Aubert, 1994; Boddy, 
1992, Hawksworth, 1992; Carlile and Watkinson, 1994).
Determination of the optimal influence of spore inoculum upon the submerged cultures was 
performed by inoculation of the spore suspensions with the following titers: 3%, 5%, and 7%. The 
experimental results showed that in small culture volumes, the amount of inoculum had no significant 
influence on enzyme biosynthesis (Kirk and Eriksson, 1990; Nevalainen and Pentilla, 1995; Baker 
et al., 1995). However, submerged cultivations in chemostat and batch systems have demonstrated the 
need for certain types of inoculum with morphological and physiological characteristics corresponding 
to the specificity of the cultivation process for which they are used as biocatalysts.
The optimal age of fungal inoculums to be used for submerged cultures was determined by test-
ing the spore suspensions of L. edodes LE 07 through cultivation in petri dishes on MEYEA (malt 
extract-yeast extract-agar) medium; the fungal cultures were maintained for 5 days at 28°C and a pH 
value of 4.5. When the PO 14 strain was tested, the variant of the mycelial inoculum having an age of 
72 h showed a stimulation of enzyme activity compared with another variant of 120 h. The influence 
of inoculum amount was obviously much more important when the cultivation processes were carried 
out in large volumes of culture medium (Wainwright, 1992; Trinci, 1992; Tsivileva et al., 2005). The 
use of an appropriate volume of inoculum has the advantage of inducing mycelia growth in the shortest 
period of time, starting at an optimal development level that ensures the reproducibility of the cultiva-
tion process (Baker et al., 1995; Beveridge et al., 1997).
1.7  NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR SUBMERGED CO-CULTIVATION OF 
MUSHROOM SPECIES
Preparation of substrates for the cultivation of edible mushrooms to convert the apple marc by sub-
merged fermentation in order to produce protein biomass to be used as feed products was carried out in 
two different compositions after prior grinding and hydration of apple marc.

12
Chapter 1  BIOTECHNOLOGY OF MUSHROOM GROWTH
In the first variant of the cultivation, as substrate 1, the apple wastes were mixed with the following 
organic and inorganic ingredients as dried matter: apple marc (30%), wheat bran (5%), CaCO3 (1%), 
NH4NO3 (0.5%), and MgSO4·5H2O (0.5%). The second alternative substrate for the cultivation of 
edible mushrooms (substrate 2) was prepared with the same sort of apple wastes, supplemented with 
organic and inorganic following components: apple marc (30%), barley bran (5%), NH4NO3 (0.5%), 
and MgSO4·5H2O (0.3%).
Both of these substrates were used in experiments of fungal fermentation of winery wastes through 
mono- and co-cultures of L. edodes and P. ostreatus mushroom species. Optimal temperatures for the 
growth and development of mycelium in both monocultures and co-cultures of these mushroom species 
were recorded in the range of 23–25°C, at an initial pH index of 5.5–6.5, and a stirring speed which 
ranged between 60 and 90 rpm.
The composition of the cultivation substrate, the index levels of pH, incubation temperature, agita-
tion speed, inoculum age, and volume of samples are all the same physical, chemical, and biological 
factors that influence the evolution of the submerged fermentation process in its different stages up  
to the end of substrate conversion into useful biological products (Petre et  al., 2014b; Ropars  
et al., 1992).
Experiments in the cultivation of both mushroom species, L. edodes and P. ostreatus, in monocul-
tures and co-cultures as submerged fermentation of winery wastes, were performed using a laboratory-
scale bioreactor equipped with main control system operational parameters, incorporating a device 
for maintaining a constant temperature, a device for the supply of sterile air, a mechanical stirrer, an 
inoculum tank, a pH index correction device, and an automation system for driving the biotechnologi-
cal process.
To establish the efficiency of submerged fermentation processes for the winery wastes for conver-
sion into fungal biomass to be used as feed products, the mushroom species have been used in pairs, 
as co-cultures, and separated as monocultures, for periods of time between 20 and 30 days, using and 
inoculum age of 3 days and having a volume size between 3% and 9% (v/v).
The reducing sugar content was determined during the biotechnological experiments by using the 
method laid down by Kubicek et al. (1993), and the total amount of nitrogen that was accumulated in 
the fungal biomass obtained by culturing the two species of mushrooms on two different substrates was 
analyzed by the Kjeldahl method (Table 1.3).
The results recorded during experiments showed an increase in the amount of reducing sugars in 
conjunction with a corresponding increase in the total nitrogen content when using co-cultures as com-
pared to monocultures belonging to the same species of edible mushrooms.
The optimum temperatures for the growth and development of the mycelium in both monocultures 
and co-cultures of both species of fungi have been recorded in the range from 23°C to 25°C, at an initial 
level of pH index between 5.5 and 6.5 and a stirring speed which ranged between 60 and 90 rpm. The 
analysis of total nitrogen content of fungal biomass (g% d.m.) in the conversion process, for substrate 
S1 and substrate S2, strictly depending on the type of culture and time period, highlights the constant 
accumulation of nitrogen in the total fungal biomass in the three culture types (Table 1.4).
The results of the determination of reducing sugars (Kubicek et al., 1993) were correlated with those 
on lowering the amount of dry matter contained in cultivation substrates, during the course of conver-
sion processes fungal, and then compared between the monocultures and co-cultures of L. edodes and 
P. ostreatus, as shown in Table 1.5. The progress of weight loss in the total amount of dry matter (%) 
of the composition of the two types of the cultivation substrates (S1 and S2) is in direct correlation to 
the rate of their decomposition.

The bioprocess to obtain the nutritional biomass of P. ostreatus was carried out using the cultivation 
medium composed of all natural ingredients, which provide the development of submerged fermenta-
tion induced by fungal enzymatic activity, and was much faster and showed far greater economic effi-
ciency compared to currently used methods.

The biotechnological process of controlled SCM showed the following advantages:
1.	 uses nutrient media consisting of fully natural ingredients for culturing the strain P. ostreatus, in 
order to obtain a food supplement with high nutritional value;
2.	 removes the technological processes and does not require expensive cultivation substrates and 
auxiliary materials, which could increase production costs;
3.	 provides short production time with increased amounts of fungal biomass, which contains 
biologically active substances with nutritional properties significantly higher than other farming 
methods employed to date.
1.8  CONCLUDING REMARKS
The optimization of any submerged cultivation bioprocess is essential for biotechnological development 
in an industrial-scale application. In this respect, it should be taken into consideration that the physical 
and chemical factors interact and affect the efficacy of the bioprocess regarding mycelia growth inside 
the liquid medium. Comparing all registered data, it may be noticed that the correlation between the 
dry weight of mycelia pellets and their protein, sugar, and nitrogen contents is kept at a balanced ratio, 
as in case of the fungal pellets of each tested mushroom species.
The processing of the recorded data on variations in the concentration of total reducing sugars 
(mg/g) in the fungal biomass grown on substrates S1 and S2, depending on the culture type and for 
different periods of time, showed significant differences between the amounts of total reducing sug-
ars in the biomass accumulated obtained during the three types of fungal cultures. The co-culture of 
L. edodes and P. ostreatus showed the highest rate of accumulation of reducing sugars, with values 

15

of 30–32 mg/g, significantly higher than specific monocultures of L. edodes and P. ostreatus, which 
recorded maximum amounts of 26–28.5 mg/g and 19–21 mg/g, respectively.
The data relating to the variation of total nitrogen content in the fungal biomass synthesized dur-
ing the bioconversion of substrate S1, depending on the time and type of culture, shows a highly 
significant percentage difference between the type of co-culture and the monocultures, in particular 
with that belonging to L. edodes. Statistically analyzing the change in the total nitrogen content of the 
fungal biomass (g% dry matter) during the bioconversion of substrate S2, depending on the culture type 
and the specific period of time, showed significant differences among all mushroom cultures, which 
reflect the lower efficiency of nitric biosynthesis for monocultures compared to the type of co-culture.
The results concerning the reducing sugars were correlated with those concerning the lowering of 
dry matter contained in cultivation substrates during the bioconversion processes, and then they were 
comparatively analyzed in case of the monocultures and co-culture of L. edodes and P. ostreatus. The 
weight loss of the total amount of dry matter (%) from the composition of the cultivation substrates (S1 
and S2) is in direct correlation to the rate of their decomposition. The analysis of total nitrogen content 
of fungal biomass (g% d.m.) in the conversion process, substrate S1 and substrate S2, strictly depend-
ing on the type of culture and time period, highlights the constant accumulation of nitrogen in the total 
fungal biomass in the three culture types.
By comparing the registered results concerning the use of both substrates for SCM, there are signifi-
cant differences between them whatever the type of fungal cultures and time periods used for each phase 
of the bioconversion, which highlights the important influence of substrate composition in the efficient 
cultivation of mushroom for getting a mycelial biomass with high nutritional value and economic benefit.

2.1  INTRODUCTION
The woody wastes which are produced every year during fruit tree pruning in all Romanian orchards 
represent in total a huge amount of redundant materials that need to be recycled through their use as 
main substrates for solid-state mushroom cultivation. These organic materials coming from the fruit 
trees are composed of dried trunks, branches, leaves, and even fruit seeds. Statistical data showed that 
in 2012 between 1.2 and 1.5 tons/ha of dried trunks and branches of fruit tree wastes are produced on 
around 75.000 ha in Romania, resulting a total amount of 90,000 tons up to 112,500 tons of such ligno-
cellulosic materials (www.eubia.org; www.insse.ro).
Taking into consideration that almost 90% of all these redundant organic wastes are used as the 
cheapest fuels for heating of fruit tree farm owners and only about 10% are used as raw materials for 
furniture manufacturing, it is obviously a great challenge for fruit tree farmers to apply the biotechnol-
ogy of recycling the fruit tree wastes as natural substrates for mushroom cultivation.
The biotechnology of lignocellulosic material conversion into high-value products normally requires 
multistep processes, which include pretreatment (mechanical, chemical, or biological), polymer 
hydrolysis to produce readily metabolizable molecules (e.g., hexose or pentose sugars), the use of such 
molecules to support microbial growth or to produce biochemical compounds, and the separation and 
purification of final products (Chang and Miles, 2004; Chahal, 1994; Breene, 1990).
The laboratory experiments which are presented in this chapter were carried out on testing and opti-
mization of fruit tree waste recycling through controlled cultivation of edible and medicinal mushroom 
species Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus in order to retrieve their carpophores to be used 
as food and nutraceuticals. To achieve these goals, a new and innovative environmental biotechnology 
was applied for full recovery and valorization of all fruit tree wastes (leaves, branches, dried trunks), 
usable as raw materials of hitherto untapped economic value, to prepare nutritive substrates for mush-
room growth. In this way, the lignocellulosic wastes of fruit trees may be integrated extremely quickly 
into the main cycles of organic matter in nature, as new links in the natural food chain made by the

cultivation of edible and medicinal mushrooms belonging to the mentioned species (Beguin, 1990; 
Verstraete and Top, 1992; Smith, 1998; Wedde et al., 1999).
Among the Basidiomycetes group, the genus Pleurotus includes a group of ligninolytic mushrooms 
with medicinal properties and important biotechnological and environmental applications. Thus, the 
solid-state cultivation of Pleurotus species is an economically important food industry worldwide, 
which has expanded in the past few years (Arjona et al., 2009; Das and Mukherjee, 2007; Kurt and 
Buyukalaca, 2010). Pleurotus ostreatus is the second most cultivated edible mushroom worldwide after 
Agaricus bisporus, according to Sanchez (2010). Normally, P. ostreatus, known as oyster mushroom, 
requires a shorter growth time in comparison to other edible mushrooms (Ropars et al., 1992; Salmones 
et al., 2005; Kachlishvili et al., 2006).
The substrates used for the cultivation of this mushroom species do not require complex ingredients 
to be added, and hence are less expensive (Leahy and Colwell, 1990; Moser, 1994; Rani et al., 2008). 
By growing P. ostreatus, the oyster mushrooms, the lignocellulosic materials are converted in a high 
percentage into fruiting bodies, increasing profitability (McIntyre, 1987; Obodai et al., 2003; Sanchez, 
2004; Songulashvili et al., 2005).
Pleurotus ostreatus demands few environmental controls, their fruiting bodies are not often attacked 
by pathogens or pests, and they can be cultivated in a simple and cheap way. All this makes P. ostreatus 
cultivation an excellent alternative for production of mushrooms as compared to other mushroom spe-
cies (Chahal and Hachey, 1990; Eichlerova et al., 2000; Uphoff, 2002; Holker et al., 2004).
Cultivation of P. ostreatus strains for commercial purposes could be performed in plastic bags, and 
the tree leaves appear to be an excellent growth substrate for conversion into fruiting bodies, with a 
biological efficiency of 108–118% (Stamets, 2000; Robinson et al., 2001; Elisashvili et al., 2008).
2.2  THE SOLID-STATE CULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS (SSCM) ON 
LIGNOCELLULOSIC WASTES OF FRUIT TREES
For the development and application of biotechnology for conversion of fruit tree wastes, experiments 
were set up for the cultivation of the mushroom species previously mentioned on substrates made of 
wastes from performing operations involving the cutting of dry or unproductive branches of tree spe-
cies of apple, plum, and cherry, and the dried leaves after their collection. The application of such bio-
technology allows a consistent reduction of pollutant effects induced by constant accumulation of huge 
quantities of lignocellulosic wastes, which are produced annually on every fruit tree farm in Romania.
In our experiments, two mushroom species, namely G. lucidum (Wm. Curtis: Fries) Karsten and 
P. ostreatus (Jacquin ex Fries) Kummer, belonging to the mushroom collection of the University of 
Pitesti, were used for testing as biodegrading agents of lignocellulosic wastes of fruit trees. The stock 
cultures were maintained on Difco malt-extract agar (MEA) slants (Difco), incubated at 25°C for 5–7 
days, and then stored at 4°C. To prepare the inoculum for solid-state cultivation on fruit tree wastes, the 
seed cultures were grown in 250-mL Erlenmayer flasks containing 100 mL of Difco malt-extract broth 
(MEB) at 23°C on rotary shaker incubators at 150 rpm (rotations per minute) for 7 days (Jiang, 2010; 
Park et al., 2001; Wagner et al., 2004; Elisashvili, 2012).
The mushroom cultures were prepared by inoculating 100 mL of MEB culture medium using 3–5% (v/v) 
of the seed culture and then were grown at 23–25°C inside the Erlenmayer flasks of 250 mL, mounted on 
a rotary shaking incubator. The experiments were conducted under the following conditions: temperature, 

21
2.2  SSCM ON LIGNOCELLULOSIC WASTES OF FRUIT TREES
25°C; agitation speed, 120–180 rev/min; initial pH, 4.5–5.5. After 10–12 days of incubation, all the mush-
room cultures were ready to be inoculated with mycelium in aseptic conditions.
2.2.1  PREPARATION OF SUBSTRATES FOR SSCM
Before starting the proper bioprocess of mushroom cultivation, all lignocellulosic wastes, mainly com-
posed of trunks, branches, and leaves belonging to apple, plum, and cherry trees, were dried at least 
6 months at 25–30°C after they were collected from the fruit tree farms. Then all woody dried materials 
were chopped and split into relatively equal-sized fragments of 3–5 cm.
Five variants of mushroom cultivation substrates were set up, made of lignocellulosic wastes 
belonging to apple, plum, and cherry trees, mixed with cereal grain wastes from the milling industry, 
such as wheat bran (5% w/w) and barley bran (5% w/w). These natural ingredients were added with the 
role of enhancing the processes of growth and development of the mycelium of the fungi used, in order 
to stimulate enzymatic activity of the fungal species, as well as the processes of growth and develop-
ment of mycelia biomass, according to Table 2.1.
2.2.2  MAIN STAGES OF SSCM
In the first phase, all variants of substrates for mushroom cultivation were soaked in a tap water–based 
synthetic medium containing 5 g/L yeast extract for 20 h at room temperature. After leaching, 1 kg of 
the substrate was placed in polypropylene gas-permeable bags for sterilization by autoclaving at 121°C 
for 1 h (Saddler et al., 1993; Wainwright, 1992). After cooling at room temperature (23–25°C), in the 
second phase of the experiments, the bags containing lignocellulosic wastes of apple, plum, and cherry 
trees were inoculated with 10% (wet weight) of mycelium from pure cultures of the species G. lucidum 
and P. ostreatus, using the hood with sterile air laminar flow for aseptic handling of biological materi-
als during the inoculation. The inoculated bags were incubated in the dark at 23°C. Immediately after 
inoculation of substrates with the pure mushroom cultures of mentioned species, the inoculated plastic 
bags (three replicates for each strain/substrate) were placed in growth chambers to be kept at a constant 
temperature of 21 or 23°C, during an incubation period lasting between 20 and 30 days, depending on 
the cultivated mushroom species (van den Twell et al., 1994; Stamets, 2000).

After incubation, the bags were exposed over 3 days at 4°C to experience a cold shock necessary 
for the stimulation of fruit body formation. Then the blocks were kept in the fruiting room at 15–18°C, 
having a relative humidity around 90%, an aeration volume of 3 shifts/h, and under illumination of 
about 1500 lux (Arjona et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 2002; Stamets, 2000). When the first primordia 
appeared, the bags were removed from the blocks formed by the mycelium colonization on the whole 
surface and inside the substrate volume. Thus, the carpophores emerged outside the plastic bags and 
they were collected during three consecutive flushes (Rosado et al., 2002; Songulashvili et al., 2005; 
Sainos et al., 2006).
Regarding the amounts of fresh fungal biomass produced by cultivation of G. lucidum and P. ostrea-
tus mycelia, the experimental results, which are presented in Figures 2.1 and 2.2, reflect the variation 
of fungal biomass growth on the substrates consisting of fruit tree wastes, supplemented with natural 
ingredients, according to Table 2.1, depending on both substrate type and fungal species.
Taking into consideration the statistical processing of the recorded data after performing chemical 
analysis, there was a variation in the amount of fresh fungal biomass produced by G. lucidum mycelia, 
depending on the substrates made of apple, plum, and cherry tree wastes, which reached an average 
value of 21% w/w; in the case of P. ostreatus, the average quantity of biomass was significantly greater, 
registering 28.75% w/w, as shown in Figure 2.1.

2.2  SSCM ON LIGNOCELLULOSIC WASTES OF FRUIT TREES
On the other hand, the ratio of the average quantity of mycelial biomass obtained by the solid-state 
cultivation of mushroom (SSCM) species G. lucidum and P. ostreatus registered only a difference of 
5 g% in the substrate variants made of apple and plum tree wastes, while in the case of cherry tree 
wastes, the difference was of 9 g% w/w in comparison with plum tree wastes and 14% w/w compared 
to apple tree wastes (Figure 2.2).
2.2.3  CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE COLLECTED MUSHROOMS
To prove the effectiveness of the biotechnological procedure which was applied to test the biochemical 
ability of mushroom species to convert the fruit tree wastes into useful products, chemical analyses 
were carried out at the end of the mushroom cultures.
The fungal biomass produced after the cultivation cycles was investigated to determine the dry 
matter, carbohydrates, total nitrogen, and protein, both for secondary mycelium and for carpophores 
belonging to the cultivated fungal species. Initially, the contents of dry matter of mycelia and carpo-
phores were analyzed for both mushroom species G. lucidum and P. ostreatus, using a drying oven at a 
temperature of 105°C and weighing the dried sample directly. The results showed a higher dried matter 
content for G. lucidum species compared with P. ostreatus. The differences between dry matter con-
tents of the biomass of fungi tested in experiments demonstrated significant differences of 15–16 g% 
FIGURE 2.2

Chapter 2  BIOTECHNOLOGICAL RECYCLING OF FRUIT TREE WASTES
between secondary mycelium and the carpophores (fruit bodies) of each of the mentioned species 
(Petre and Petre, 2013).
To determine the soluble carbohydrates in carpophores as well as the secondary mycelium of 
G. lucidum and P. ostreatus, the colorimetric method with anthrone reagent was used (Dubois et al., 
1956), modified by the phenol-sulfuric acid method in microplate format Masuko et  al., 2005). 
Comparing the results, there are no significant differences between the two cultivated species. 
Regarding the variation of soluble carbohydrate content as determined by the analysis of mushroom 
biomass belonging to G. lucidum and P. ostreatus, depending on the stage of mycelium development, 
there is a significant difference of 4.1 g% d.m. between the secondary and tertiary stage (corresponding 
to carpophore formation) of G. lucidum but only 3.35 g% d.m. in the case of P. ostreatus. At the end of 
the cultivation cycle, the total protein content was determined by the Lowry method (1951), for both 
the secondary mycelium and carpophores of mushrooms species G. lucidum and P. ostreatus. There 
were significant differences between the total protein contents of secondary mycelia compared to those 
of carpophores for both mushroom species. The total protein content of the carpophores belonging 
to G. lucidum was registered as 17.1 g/kg d.m., which means a significant improvement, while for 
P. ostreatus carpophores, it was only 15.4 g/kg d.m.
The quantitative analyses of total nitrogen in the fungal biomass during the controlled cultivation 
cycles of G. lucidum and P. ostreatus on each of cultivation substrates were carried out by the Kjeldahl 
method. The variations in total nitrogen content, calculated in relation to dry matter of the obtained 
biomass, were noted in the case of P. ostreatus grown on substrates S1, S3 and S2, the values ranging 
between 14.7 and 12.3 g% d.m., while for G. lucidum cultivation, the largest quantities of total nitrogen 
were recorded for substrates S3, S2, and S1, between 14.3 and 12.1 g% d.m. (Figures 2.3 and 2.4).
During the formation of carpophores of both species of mushrooms, there were registered three 
periods of 7 days, corresponding to the cyclic occurrence of fruit bodies related to the fungal species 
in question (Petre and Petre, 2012; Petre et al., 2014). Data regarding the total weight of P. ostreatus 
carpophores emerged in bags containing all five types of cultivation substrates were regularly recorded

and are presented in Table 2.2. The entire fruiting period was conducted over 30 days under constant 
temperature (15–18°C), relative humidity (80–85%), and air intake (3 shifts/h).
The cultivation of both mushroom species on the same cultivation substrates showed that the mushroom 
yield was strain dependent (Table 2.2). Biological efficiency (BE) was estimated as the ratio of the weight 
of fresh fruiting bodies and weight of dry substrate, multiplied by 100. P. ostreatus cultivated on substrate 
S1 and S3 as well as G. lucidum grown on S1 appeared to be the most productive mushroom/substrate vari-
ant ratio compared with the rest of the cultivation variants, registering a BE between 95% and 90.5%. All

the cultivated mushroom species were more productive, especially during the first flush. Statistical analysis 
of the results regarding the weight of carpophores, revealed the highest values in the first three stages of 
cultivation (Petre et al., 2014). At the same time, the most productive substrates were found to be S1 and S2, 
followed, finally, by substrate S3. Based on the experiments carried out, the results of the laboratory-scale 
biotechnology for recycling of fruit tree wastes by controlled cultivation of mushroom species G. lucidum 
and P. ostreatus are shown in Figure 2.5.

strated significant differences of 15–16 g% between secondary mycelium and the carpophores (fruiting 
bodies) of each of the mentioned species.

biomass belonging to G. lucidum and P. ostreatus, depending on the stage of mycelium development, 
there is a significant difference of 4.1 g% d.m. between the secondary and tertiary stages (correspond-
ing to carpophore formation) of G. lucidum and only 3.35 g% d.m. in case of P. ostreatus. It was noticed 
that there are significant differences between total protein contents of secondary mycelia compared to 
those of carpophores for the two mushroom species. Thus, the total protein content of the carpophores 
belonging to G. lucidum was registered as 17.1 g/kg d.m., which is a significant improvement, while for 
P. ostreatus carpophores, it was only 15.4 g/kg d.m.
The variations in total nitrogen content, calculated in relation to the dry matter of the obtained bio-
mass, were noticed in the case of P. ostreatus species grown on the substrates S1, S3, and S2, the values 
ranging between 14.7 and 12.3 g% d.m., while for G. lucidum cultivation, the largest quantities of total 
nitrogen were recorded for substrates S3, S2, and S1, between 14.3 and 12.1 g% d.m.
Statistical analysis of the results regarding the weight of carpophores harvested at the end of the 
cultivation cycle on fruit tree wastes used as substrates revealed that the highest values were registered 
in the first three stages of cultivation, which were recorded as the most significant results, and the most 
productive substrates were found to be S1 and S2, followed, finally, by the substrate S3.

3.1  INTRODUCTION
Many of the agricultural lignocellulosic wastes which are produced every day in the world cause seri-
ous environmental pollution effects if they are allowed to accumulate in the agro-ecosystems or, much 
worse, burned for uncontrolled domestic purposes. Every year, large amounts of lignocellulosic wastes 
are generated through forestry and agricultural practices, in timber industries and many agroindustries, 
generating environmental pollution problems by their burning on the soil surface or their incorporation 
into the soil matrix. The optimal and efficient way to solve these problems is to recycle these ligno-
cellulosic wastes as main ingredients in nutritive compost preparations that could be used for edible 
mushrooms cultivation (Petre and Petre, 2012).
So far, the basis of most studies on lignocellulose-degrading fungi has been economic rather than 
ecological, with emphasis on the applied aspects of lignin and cellulose decomposition, including bio-
degradation and bioconversion (Boddy, 1992; Beguin and Aubert, 1994; Chahal, 1994; Carlile and 
Watkinson, 1994; Uphoff, 2002).
A wide range of biomass resources are produced all over the world, including whole plants, plant 
parts (e.g., seeds, roots, stems) or plant constituents (e.g., starch, lipids, protein, and fiber), processing 
by-products (distiller’s grains, corn solubles), animal by-products, and municipal and industrial wastes 
(Smith et al., 1987). All these resources can be used to create new biomaterials, and for this purpose 
they have to be converted into bioproducts. This process of bioconversion requires a deep knowledge 
of raw material composition, so that the desired functional elements can be obtained for bioproduct 
production (Kleman-Leyer et al., 1992; Nevalainen and Pentilla, 1995; Lestan and Lamar, 1996).
Bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials to useful, higher-value products normally requires multi-
step processes, which include: (i) pretreatment (mechanical, chemical, or biological) of raw materials, 
(ii) hydrolysis of the polymers to produce readily metabolizable molecules (e.g., hexose or pentose 
sugars), (iii) use of these compounds to support microbial growth or to produce chemical products, and 
(iv) separation and purification (Tanaka and Matsuno, 1985; Smith et al., 1987; Smith, 1998; Verstraete 
and Top, 1992; Zarnea, 1994).

Chapter 3  CONTROLLED CULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS ON WINERY
3.2  SOLID-STATE CULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS (SSCM) ON WINERY AND 
VINEYARD WASTES
The biotechnological processes for the total recovery of lignocellulosic wastes resulting from industrial 
processing of grapes, as well as the maintenance of vineyards, through solid-state cultivation of mush-
rooms were tested using two Basidiomycetes species, namely, Ganoderma lucidum (Curt.: Fr.) P. Karst 
and Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacquin ex Fries) Kummer (Hawksworth et al., 1995).
The experiments were achieved by in vitro growth of these fungal species in special rooms, where 
the main culture parameters were kept at optimal levels in order to get the greatest production of mush-
room fruit bodies. The effects of culture compost composition (carbon, nitrogen, and mineral sources) 
as well as other physical and chemical factors (such as temperature, inoculum amount, pH level, incu-
bation time) on mycelial net formation, and especially on fruit body induction, were investigated.
The stock cultures were maintained on malt-extract agar (MEA) slants. Slants were incubated at 
25°C for 5–7 days and then stored at 4°C. The fungal cultures were grown in 250-mL flasks contain-
ing 100 mL of MEA medium (20% malt extract, 2% yeast extract, 20% agar-agar) at 23°C on rotary 
shaker incubators at 110 rotations per minute (rpm) for 5–7 days. The fungal cultures designed to be 
used in experiments were prepared by inoculating 100 mL of cultivation medium with 3–5% (v/v) of 
the seed culture and then cultivated at 23–25°C in rotary shake flasks of 250 mL. The experiments were 
conducted under the following conditions: temperature, 25°C; agitation speed, 90–120 rpm; initial pH, 
4.5–5.5. The seed culture was then transferred to the fungal culture medium and cultivated for 7–12 
days (Petre et al., 2007; Glazebrook et al., 1992; Ropars et al., 1992).
In the next step of the experiments, the incubation of prepared fungal cultures was performed by 
keeping them in growth rooms where all the culture parameters were maintained at optimal levels in 
order to get the greatest production of fruit bodies. During the experiments, the effects of culture com-
post composition (carbon, nitrogen, and mineral sources) as well as other physical and chemical factors 
(such as temperature, inoculum size and volume, and incubation time) on mycelial net formation, and 
especially on fruit body induction, were investigated (Petre and Petre, 2008).
During and after the run cycles conducted for proper cultivation of edible mushroom species, certain bio-
chemical analyses were performed in order to determine the composition of plant constituents which were 
used as substrates for cultivation, determining initial dry matter content by dehydrating the plant material at 
105°C to constant weight. Then we proceeded to determine photometrically the content of soluble sugars by 
the method proposed by Panczel and Eifert (1960), with anthrone reagent, after their extraction from plant 
tissue with 80% ethanol; Kerepesi et al.’s (1996) method was also referred to. The amount of crude fiber 
(residue consisting of soluble or insoluble parts of cell membranes in the plant tissue, obtained by treating 
the residue under specified conditions with acids and bases of certain concentrations) was determined by 
the method of Henneberg and Stohmann (1864), supplemented by that of Greenfield and Southgate (1992).
The total nitrogen content determined for the two types of organic wastes was determined by the Kjeldahl 
method. In addition, measurements were taken to establish the content of phenolic compounds, through 
dosage of UV (λ-275 nm) using tannins extracted in ethyl alcohol 80% (Hagerman and Butler, 1978).
The lipids were dosed according to the protocol proposed by Zollner and Kirsch (Gunstone et al., 
1994), involving extraction in methanol:chloroform= 1:1 (v/v). Mineral components were quantified by 
atomic absorption spectroscopy, after solubilization of ash with 5N HCl (Ihnat, 1982). Also, measure-
ments were taken of the pH of the aqueous solution of grape marc, where the ratio of grape marc extract 
to water was 1:10; the potentiometric pH values were recorded indicating an acid reaction of grape marc.

3.2  SSCM ON WINERY AND VINEYARD WASTES
Due to the particularities of structure and chemical composition of these vegetable wastes, the 
pretreatment methods proved to be a particularly important application before their being used as sub-
strates to grow mushrooms (McIntyre, 1987; Leahy and Colwell, 1990; Gregg and Saddler, 1996). 
In addition, the physical and chemical properties of grape marc differ according to the proportion of 
stalks, seeds, and skins of the grapes, and they vary as well depending on the variety (McCarty, 1988; 
Chahal and Hachey, 1990; Lamar et al., 1992).
Chemical analysis of grape marc showed that total nitrogen was present in a relatively high pro-
portion (13.7%), which allows its use as a source of nitrogen for macromycetes which are grown on 
substrates made of such winery wastes. Also, the cellulose and soluble carbohydrate contents in grape 
marc have registered appropriate levels for use as carbon sources during the conversion process of 
substrates for mushroom cultivation.
The relatively high content of phenolic compounds in the composition of grape marc was due to 
primarily to the anthocyanin pigments that exist in red grapes. The amount of ash resulting from the 
incineration of plant waste at 550°C was almost four times higher for grape marc compared to the 
sample resulting from the calcination of vineyard wastes. The results were recorded per 100 g dry 
matter, as shown in Figures 3.1 and 3.2.

Chapter 3  CONTROLLED CULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS ON WINERY
In terms of chemical content regarding the macro- and micronutrients, it was noted that the grape 
marc had significantly higher amounts than the woody materials derived from vineyard wastes. These 
wastes were used for the preparation of nutritive substrates on which to grow the mushroom species G. 
lucidum and P. ostreatus. Five variants of cultivation substrates were prepared, as well as one control 
sample to be used in experiments.
These compost variants were mixed with other needed natural ingredients in order to improve the 
enzymatic activity of mushroom mycelia and to convert the cellulose content of grape marc and vine-
yard wastes into protein biomass as carpophores. The best compositions of the five compost variants 
are presented in Table 3.1.
All the culture substrates for mushroom growth were steam sterilized at a pressure of 1.1 atm and 
at a temperature of 121°C for 60 min. (Saddler et al., 1993; Crawford and Crawford, 1980; Finkelstein 
and Ball, 1992). Then they were inoculated using liquid inoculum with an age of 5–7 days, with the 
volume size ranging between 3% and 7% (v/w). During the period of 18–20 days after the inoculation, 
all the fungal cultures developed a significant biomass on the culture substrates made of grape marc and 
vineyard wastes. These wastes were used as the main ingredients to prepare natural substrates for mush-
room growth. The optimal temperatures for incubation and mycelia growth were maintained between

23°C and 25°C. The whole period of mushroom growth from inoculation to fruit body formation lasted 
between 30 and 70 days, depending on the fungal species used in experiments (Petre et al., 2007).
The experiments were carried out inside growth rooms, where the main culture parameters (tem-
perature, humidity, aeration) were kept at optimal levels to get the greatest production of mushroom 
fruit bodies (Moser, 1994; Stamets, 2000; Sanchez, 2010).
In comparison with organic nitrogen sources, the inorganic ones gave rise to relatively lower growth 
of mycelium and fungal biomass production (Bae et al., 2000). The influence of various mineral sources 
on fungal biomass production was examined at a standard concentration level of 5 mg. In comparison 
of KH2PO4 and MgSO4·5H2O as mineral sources tested in experiments, K2HPO4 yielded good mycelia 
growth as well as fungal biomass production, and for this reason it was recognized as a favorable min-
eral source. Also, K2HPO4 could improve productivity through its buffering action, being favorable for 
mycelia growth (Kirk and Eriksson, 1990; Wainwright, 1992; Moo-Young, 1993; Wedde et al., 1999; 
Papaspyridi et al., 2012).
In order to study the effects of the initial medium pH in correlation with the incubation temperature 
upon fruit body formation, experiments using G. lucidum and P. ostreatus mushrooms were carried 
out for 6 days at 25°C with an initial pH of 5.5. Similar observations were made by Stamets (2000), 
because the optimization of substrate composition and cultivation conditions are essential for enhanc-
ing efficiency in a submerged culture.
To find the optimal incubation temperature for mycelia growth, these fungal species were cultivated 
at different temperatures, ranging from 20°C to 25°C; in the end, the optimum temperature was found to 
be 23°C, and the appropriate pH level was 5.5. The best levels of pH and temperature for fruit body pro-
duction were found between 5.0°C and 5.5°C and 21°C and 23°C. Among several fungal physiological 
properties, the age and volume of mycelia inoculum may play an important role in fungal hyphae devel-
opment, as well as in fruit body formation (Petre and Petre, 2013). To examine the effect of inoculum age 
and volume, mushroom species G. lucidum and P. ostreatus were grown on substrates made of vineyard 
wastes over different time periods between 30 and 90 days, varying the inoculum volume (5–7 v/w). All 
the experiments were carried out at 25°C and an initial pH of 5.5. An inoculum age of 120 h as well as 
an inoculum volume of 6.0 (v/w) had beneficial effects on the fungal biomass production.
During the mushroom growing cycles, the specific rates of cellulose biodegradation were determined 
using the direct method of biomass weighing, the results being expressed as percentage of dry matter 
(d.m.) before and after cultivation (Songulashvili et al., 2005; Sanchez, 2010; Turlo, 2014). The data

revealed that by applying this biotechnology, the grape marc and vineyard wastes could be recycled as 
useful raw materials for mushroom compost preparation in order to get significant mushroom production.
In order to determine the evolution of the total nitrogen content in the fungal biomass, samples 
were collected at precise time intervals of 50 h; these were analyzed by using the Kjeldahl method. 
The results concerning the evolution of total nitrogen content in G. lucidum biomass are presented in 
Figure 3.3 and the data regarding P. ostreatus biomass can be seen in Figure 3.4.

3.3  SCM IN LIQUID MEDIA CONTAINING WINERY WASTES
Based on the experimental results, the laboratory biotechnology for cultivation of edible mush-
rooms G. lucidum and P. ostreatus on grape marc and vineyard wastes was developed to produce nutri-
tive biomass as carpophores (fruiting bodies).
From the point of view of total duration of biological cycle to produce carpophores, P. ostreatus 
was found to be the fastest mushroom culture (30–35 days), followed by G. lucidum (50–60 days). It 
is important to note that the experiments demonstrated the feasibility of biotechnological processes 
applied to edible mushroom cultivation on substrates consisting of wastes resulting from viticulture and 
the winemaking industry, as well as the efficiency of their use for the production of nutritive biomass 
as fruit bodies of mushroom species, and finally as fodder, obtained by dehydration of exhausted sub-
strates used for mushroom cultivation.
3.3  SUBMERGED CULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS (SCM) IN LIQUID MEDIA 
CONTAINING WINERY WASTES
Submerged cultivation refers to any controlled biochemical process regarding the enzymatic conver-
sion of substrates distributed in a liquid nutrient phase, consisting mainly of carbohydrates, which 
promote the growth and development of microbial species (bacterial or fungal) under constant monitor-
ing of the physical and chemical parameters (Atlas, 1984; Levinson et al., 1994; Bae et al., 2000; Park 
et al., 2001; Subramaniyam and Vimala, 2012).
For these experiments, three species of Basidiomycetes group were used, namely, G. lucidum (W. 
Curt.: Fr) Lloyd (popular name: reishi), Lentinula edodes (Berkeley) Pegler (popular name: shiitake), 
and P. ostreatus (Jaquin ex Fries) Kummer (popular name: oyster) were used (Hawksworth et al., 
1995). These mushroom species were preserved on a special culture medium for the maintenance 
of pure cultures, specifically an average type malt-extract-agar (MEA) (20% malt extract, 2% yeast 
extract, 20% agar).
The nutrients absolutely necessary for the growth and development of mushroom mycelia were 
based on malt extract, yeast extract, peptone, CaCO3, and wheat bran, to which were added certain 
amounts of grape marc resulting from vinification processes, as specified in Table 3.2. Each of these 
nutrients can affect the growth of the fungal species used in the experiments both according to the spe-
cific amount of each and by the proportionality between them.

Chapter 3  CONTROLLED CULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS ON WINERY
The pH index of the cultivation media which were prepared for these three species of mushrooms 
had a relatively broad range of variation over the 72 h of each cultivation cycle. Analyzing the results 
obtained during the cultivation cycle of P. ostreatus species, it appeared that the version V1 presented 
performance results relatively similar to that of the control, namely a decrease from baseline of 6 pH 
units to 5 units, and then a slight improvement to 5.5, while the V2 variant showed a steady downward 
trend in the amount from pH 5.9 to a very low value of 4.7.
In case of L. edodes, the pH index variation for the variants V1 and V2 of cultivation substrates was 
recorded as having almost identical progressions, from 7 to 7.2 to 5.2 pH, compared with M version, 
which highlighted a constant curve downward from 5.2 pH, finally reaching a value of 3.5 pH.
In the case of G. lucidum, the pH index was recorded as a sinusoidal progress over the course of 72 
hours of cultivation, based on the relative similar values for V1 and V2 variants of 7.3 to 7.4 pH, reach-
ing 5.5–5.7 pH units, passing through the extreme minimum of 3.5–3.3 pH. The M variant, used as the 
control for this species, showed a relatively balanced curve compared with the other two variants, the 
initial value being identical to the final one.
The Applikon bioreactor was used to carry out the biotechnological experiments in a batch culti-
vation system, being characterized by automatic control of bioprocesses using edible and medicinal 
mushrooms and permanent monitoring of all process parameters. This is an automatized bioreactor 
consisting of an autoclavable cultivation vessel equipped with transducers for temperature, pH, and 
dissolved oxygen (DO) level, and a set of systems for agitation and aeration control (Figure 3.5).

During the course of the experiments, a system was established and developed by which the sub-
merged cultivation developed in the bioreactor batch type can be monitored, controlled, and operated 
using the remote control software and hardware assemblies. This communication system allowed the 
video monitoring of the bioreactor vessel using a webcam and data transmission on a process controller 
(Packer and Thomas, 1990). A remote control system was conducted for wireless online monitoring 
and total control of bioprocess parameters inside the cultivation medium (Petre and Petre, 2013).
The experiments mounted for studying the fermentation processes were conducted under the fol-
lowing conditions:
●	 temperature 25°C;
●	 stirring speed, 120 rotations per minute (rpm);
●	 initial pH 4.5–5.5.
All the experiments were carried out over at least three repetitions. The analysis samples were col-
lected at different time points during the fermentation process, centrifuged at a speed of 12,000 g for 
15 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a Millipore membrane filter (0.45 μm). The amount of 
the mycelium dry matter was determined after repeated washes of the fungal pellets with distilled water 
and drying at 70°C overnight in a stream of air at a constant rate.
The fungal pellets belonging to G. lucidum, L. edodes, and P. ostreatus mushroom species which 
formed during the controlled submerged cultivation were analyzed using an Olympus stereomicro-
scope, and images taken are shown in Figures 3.6–3.8.
The fungal biomass samples were initially filtered, and then the solid filtrates were dried in an oven 
at 35°C for 48 h. The amount of biomass thus obtained was weighed.
In order to determine the chemical composition of fungal biomass samples collected after carrying 
out the submerged cultivation cycle of the mushroom species, chemical measurements were carried out 
FIGURE 3.6

on the solid content of dried matter, crude cellulose, ash, fat, carbohydrates, and soluble phenolic com-
pounds (Masuko et al., 2005). The amount of total nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl method, 
and to analyze the crude fiber we used the acid hydrolysis method with an acid solution (acetic, trichlo-
roacetic, and nitric acids) that solubilizes all the available nutrients, with the exception of the raw pulp 
(cellulose, hemicellulose, inlaid substances) and mineral compounds. The lipids were analyzed by the 
Soxhlet method, and soluble sugars were determined by the Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951).

3.3  SCM IN LIQUID MEDIA CONTAINING WINERY WASTES
The chemical analyses showed that the total nitrogen in the composition of grape marc recorded a 
relatively high proportion (14.7%), which allows its use as a nitrogen source by the macromycetes grown 
on this type of waste. Both the crude fiber content (21.6%) and soluble carbohydrates (5.1%) present in 
grape marc contained sufficient amounts for use as a carbon source in the process of fungal conversion.
At the same time, the results showed a significant increase of biomass, with increasing amounts of 
grape marc in the cultivation media, with P. ostreatus variant V1 recording the highest value of 27.2 g% 
d.m. (dry matter), followed by G. lucidum variant V2 with 20.9 g% d.m., and then L. edodes variant V2 
by 20 g% d.m.
In contrast to the variants that were recorded as the highest values in respect of the final amount of 
fungal biomass resulting after performance of controlled submerged culture processes, other variants 
were recorded in the range of 13.9 to 18.9 g% d.m. (Figure 3.9).
Determination of the chemical elements carbon (C%), nitrogen (N%), sulfur (S%), and hydrogen 
(H%) in the fungal biomass obtained by the submerged cultivation of mushrooms in the experiments 
was performed by the Dumas method (known as dry combustion) using the analyzer Vario Macro 
analyzer. This involved dehydration at 105°C, grinding, and mixing the final powder in order to obtain 
homogeneous samples. The combustion was done at 1150°C and, in the next step, reduction took place 
in the second furnace at 850°C in a helium flow, allowing the reduction of nitrogen oxides to molecular 
nitrogen (N2).
The chemical elements C, N, H, and S were determined through thermoelectric cells, and the analy-
ses were performed after previously calibrating with substances of which the composition of these ele-
ments was already known. Thus, sulfanilamide was used for calibration of the following composition: 
N: 16.25%, C: 41.81%, S: 18.62%, and H: 4.65%. The amount of crude protein was deducted from the 
amount of total nitrogen according to the relationship: Crude Protein (%) = Total Nitrogen × 4.38. The

conversion factor from total nitrogen in protein is 4.38, as described in the literature (Braaksma and 
Schaap, 1996).
According to the results obtained after carrying out these biochemical investigations (Table 4.6), 
it can be concluded that the concentration levels of the four elements analyzed were more diminished 
in the case of variants M, V1, and V2 compared with the corresponding cultivation substrates. This is 
explained by the fact that the biotechnological processes of submerged cultivation caused significant 
biochemical transformations of initial chemical composition of the cultivation substrates due to enzyme 
activities induced by the cultivated mushrooms. It may be noted that the quantitative ratio of those four 
chemical elements was kept relatively constant, which showed that metabolic processes induced by the 
enzymatic action of fungi qualitatively transformed the organic compounds from cultivation substrates 
in substances with a modified biochemical structure, under conditions in which the stoichiometric ratio 
of the elements was kept relatively constant (Table 3.3).
Regarding the protein content of fungal biomass samples belonging to G. lucidum, L. edodes, and 
P. ostreatus species, the investigation highlighted a relative decrease in the quantities of protein in 
variants V1 and V2 compared with the M variant as the control for the three species of cultivated 
mushrooms (Figure 3.10).
In the case of the V1 variant belonging to mushroom species L. edodes and G. lucidum, the protein 
concentration levels were fairly similar, 19.96 and 19.71 g% d.m., respectively, while that of P. ostreatus 
was only 14.94 g% d.m. Also, the V2 variant of L. edodes had the highest protein concentration, at 
18.92 g% d.m., followed by the same variants of P. ostreatus with 17.62 g% d.m. and, finally, G. lucidum 
with 17.49 g% d.m. The M variants (as controls for which the substrate composition did not contain grape 
marc) were recorded as having the highest values of protein concentration, which proved that grape marc 
had an inhibitory effect on fungal enzyme activity during the bioconversion of cultivation substrates.
Regarding the nitrogen content of fungal biomass samples belonging to G. lucidum, L. edodes, and 
P. ostreatus, the results demonstrated a significant proportionality of these quantities with those of each 
of the proteins (Figure 3.11).

The total duration of the cultivation cycle varied between 7 and 10 days, depending on the fungal 
species as well as the type of substrate used in submerged cultivation. Based on the results, the appro-
priate biotechnology was developed at laboratory level for fungal conversion of grape marc wastes by 
submerged cultivation of G. lucidum, L. edodes, and P. ostreatus, as shown in Figure 3.12.
3.4  CONCLUSIONS
The results showed a significant increase of biomass with increasing amounts of grape marc in cul-
tivation media; in this respect, P. ostreatus variant V1 recorded the highest value, 27.2 g% d.m. (dry 
matter), followed by G. lucidum variant V2 with 20.9 g% d.m. and L. edodes variant V2 with 20 g% 
d.m. In contrast to the variants that recorded the highest values in respect of the final amount of fungal

biomass resulting after performance of controlled submerged culture processes, other variants were in 
the range of 13.9 to 18.9 g% d.m.
Regarding the protein content of fungal biomass samples belonging to G. lucidum, L. edodes, and 
P. ostreatus, the investigation highlights a relative decrease in the quantities of protein for variants  
V1 and V2 compared with the M (control) variant for all three species of cultivated mushrooms. In the 
case of the V1 variant belonging to L. edodes and G. lucidum, the protein concentration levels were 
fairly similar, at 19.96 and 19.71 g% d.m., respectively, while that for P. ostreatus was only 14.94 g% 
d.m. Also, the V2 variant of the species L. edodes had the highest protein concentration, 18.92 g% 
d.m., followed by the same variants of P. ostreatus with 17.62 g% d.m. and, finally, G. lucidum with  
17.49 g% d.m.
The M variants (as controls, for which the substrate did not contain grape marc) were recorded as 
having the highest values of protein concentration, which proved that grape marc had an inhibitory 
effect on fungal enzyme activities during the bioconversion of cultivation substrates.
The nitrogen contents of fungal biomass samples belonging to G. lucidum, L. edodes, and P. ostreatus 
showed a significant proportionality of these quantities with those of each of the proteins. The contents 
of the chemical elements C, N, H, and S were determined through thermoelectric cells, and the analyses 
were performed after previous calibration with substances whose composition of these elements was 
known. According to the results obtained after carrying out these biochemical investigations, it can be 
concluded that the concentration levels of the four elements analyzed are more diminished in the case 
of variants M, V1, and V2 compared with the corresponding cultivation substrates.

4.1  INTRODUCTION
Recent research on the production of organic foods produced from biomass of different species of 
mushrooms, which have beneficial effects on human health, are well advanced. In-depth studies carried 
out in China, Japan, the United States, and Russia have proved highly beneficial in the production of 
foods with high nutritional value from the edible mushroom fruit bodies obtained under standardized 
conditions using biotechnological systems and continuous-flow processing in terms of food quality and 
safety (Cho et al., 2002; Reed et al., 2001; Belforte et al., 2006b).
Currently, research in the field of robotic systems with applications in the agro-food industry take 
place in over 30 prestigious universities in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, UK, Sweden, Israel, 
the United States, Canada, Japan, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Australia. Unfortunately, only some of 
these studies are involved strictly in the field of robotic systems development for growing and collect-
ing mushrooms, the most advanced of them being Silsoe Research Institute, Robotics & Automation 
Group; Warwick University, Horticulture Research International, Wellesbourne in the UK; Pennsylvania 
State University, Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering in the United States; Pingtung 
University of Science and Technology, Department of Food Science in Taiwan; Okayama University, 
Faculty of Agriculture in Japan; and TNO—Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research in 
the Netherlands (Noble et al., 1997; Heinemann et al., 1994; van Galen et al., 2003).
In conjunction with the specific technology and related equipment for cultivation and harvesting 
of mushrooms, a clear distinction must be made between the work environment and specific opera-
tions performed by human operators in mushroom farms and industrial pilot plants with automatic 
production processes and harvesting of mushrooms. In this respect, the first group mainly produces 
mushrooms to supply the fresh market, while the second group has as its main target to perform high 
production of mushrooms for the food industry (Jarvis, 1997; Che and Ting, 2004; Reed et al., 2001).
Thus, in the Netherlands, the most advanced country in Europe in the field of mushroom cultivation, 
there are currently more than 300 mechanized farms, with different levels of automation of mushroom 
production processes (van Galen et al., 2003).

Chapter 4  VIRTUAL ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR MUSHROOMS CULTIVATION
A first main feature of these farms consists of much larger areas of cultivation (usually up to 10,000 
square meters) compared to farms where manufacturing operations are carried out by humans (usually 
limited to about 1200 cultivation areas, up to 2400 square meters).
The second major feature –common to both types of mushroom producing—is the use of growth 
substrates arranged in horizontal supports (cultivation beds), loaded with organic matter made up of 
agricultural wastes, horse manure or poultry droppings, gypsum, and other ingredients. The main dis-
tinction between these two categories of mushroom production systems consists in specific production 
processes carried out in each one of them. Thus, in the case of mushroom farms with no automatic 
equipment, all processes, from the step of filling with nutritive substrates of cultivation beds to mush-
room harvesting are performed only by human personnel (Reed and Tillett, 1994; Connolly, 2003).
Mechanized farms have automatic dispensing systems for compost in the beds of cultivation, trans-
portation systems of frames in storage areas for incubation and fruiting body formation, as well as 
mechanized harvesting systems for mushroom on the cultivation beds. Such automatic collection sys-
tems can collect up to 250 kg of mushroom fruit bodies/h, as opposed to collection by human opera-
tors, by which can be obtained only about 20–30 kg of mushroom fruit bodies/h. These farms use a 
cultivation and collection cycle of 5 weeks, which includes mechanized operations of evacuation and 
emptying of frames with compost, their refill, and relocation in cultivation spaces after these areas were 
themselves mechanically cleaned.
The beneficial economic effects of the automation processes of cultivation, harvesting, and process-
ing mushrooms in mechanized farms can be summarized as including an increase of cultivated areas by 
about 5–8 times within the same production cycle, and also an increase of harvesting productivity by 
8–12 times, a reduction of 66% of staff costs, 50% decrease of fixed costs, reduction by 60% of the sale 
costs toward beneficiaries of the products obtained from such farms, and the increase of profits from 
sales by about 30–35% on average. As a result of these beneficial effects, there is a strong tendency to 
increase the number of research projects developed in the field of automatic cultivation, harvest, and 
processing of mushrooms as well as ongoing development of new concepts and specific equipment for 
greater automation of mushroom biotechnology.
The cultivation and production of mushrooms involves a lot of different operations, each of them 
requiring careful performance. To design a robotic growing system for mushroom production, it is 
compulsory to have specialized knowledge from many advanced fields of science and technology 
(Masoudian and McIsaac, 2013; Belforte et al., 2006a; Che and Ting, 2004).
The unceasing improvement and development of modern cultivation technologies, such as com-
puterized control of the whole production process, new methods applied for spawn preparation and 
sterilization of substrates needed for cultivation, and automated harvesting of mushroom fruit bodies, 
will increase the large-scale productivity of mushroom cultivation with lower costs than conventional 
technologies (Noble et al., 1997; Connolly, 2003).
In the last two decades, a lot of machinery has been designed for picking up the mushroom fruit 
bodies, especially in the case of button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), and there have been experi-
ments testing them in mushroom production. In many of these experiments, the locating and picking 
performance of robotic machineries for mushroom harvesting was assessed (Reed and Tillett, 1994; 
Belforte et al., 2006a). Some of the recent results regarding the modern technology and research are 
increasingly used in agriculture, especially in intensive cultures that ensure remunerative returns.
For instance, most organic cultures grown in greenhouses are in a category where, despite the wide 
use of technology, a lot of human operators still manually perform almost all operations on the crops, 

51
4.3  CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF ROBOTIC CULTIVATION
although they are often highly repetitive. In this respect, a multipurpose, low-cost robot prototype was 
designed and built, although more research is needed to improve the productivity of such a prototype 
(Belforte et al., 2006b). The results proved to be promising and showed some advantages that can be 
achieved with robotic automation. This fact greatly impacts on the quality of the product, on the pro-
duction costs, and on collateral issues such as pollution and safety. Knowledge of the state of advanced 
research in robotic automation with application in agriculture, outlining the characteristics that robots 
should have to allow their profitable use, is compulsory in order to select the best solutions for robotic 
automation to put into practice (Belforte et al., 2006b).
However, though the actual results are not significant enough to be applied on a large scale, the 
newest automation technologies for harvesting, transporting, and grading are in great demand. Thus, 
a robotic system was developed for harvesting lettuce plants, comprised of a three degrees of freedom 
manipulator, an end-effector, a feeding conveyor, an air blower, a machine vision device, six photoelec-
tric sensors, and a fuzzy logic controller (Cho et al., 2002).
4.2  CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES USED IN MUSHROOM CULTIVATION
Current methods for growing mushrooms on various nutritional substrates contain mostly synthetic 
ingredients, which require nonperforming, energy-intensive, and less productive and efficient machines 
compared with the structure and functionality of the robotic installation that is the subject of this 
chapter. There are various ways of growing mushrooms using conventional methods which have a lot 
of disadvantages, for the following reasons:
1.	 They require the application of energy-intensive processes, characterized by using a large number 
of appliances and heating, electrical, and electronic installations;
2.	 They do not fully ensure fully aseptic conditions imposed by proper cultivation technology for 
growth and multiplication of biological material, with a permanent risk of contamination of the 
working environment by human operators, compromising the production of mushrooms;
3.	 The mushroom production cycle does not work in a continuous flow and requires human operators 
in the sterile zone, increasing the risk of infection sources;
4.	 They do not lead to continuous production of mycelium-inoculated compost bags;
5.	 They do not allow a high and continuous production of fruit bodies and sterilized and inoculated 
substrate in bags with economical efficiency.
4.3  CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF ROBOTIC CULTIVATION AND INTEGRATED 
PROCESSING OF MUSHROOMS
The conceptual model of robotic cultivation and integrated processing of mushrooms was designed as 
a fully automatic installation with a modular structure and multiple workflows, which are compulsory 
for continuous production of organic fruiting bodies belonging to edible and medicinal mushrooms in 
fully aseptic conditions, with complete elimination of any human operator along the overall production 
chain (Petre et al., 2010).

52
Chapter 4  VIRTUAL ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR MUSHROOMS CULTIVATION
Starting from the thermo-sterilization of heat-resistant plastic bags filled with nutritive substrates, 
going through robotic inoculation with liquid mycelium, and continuing the cultivation flow through 
mushroom incubation and fruit body formation inside sterilized and inoculated bags placed in special 
growth rooms (with fully controlled atmosphere and robotic manipulation devices), the biotechnologi-
cal process was designed to be finished with automatic crop harvesting of mushroom fruit bodies and 
aseptic removal of bags containing the exhausted substrates used for cultivation. Then, by prepar-
ing and processing the plastic bags filled with sterilized organic substrates and inoculated with liquid 
mycelium, they could be commercialized to customers interested in the processing and sale of fruiting 
bodies belonging to edible and medicinal mushrooms produced through continuous controlled cultiva-
tion in a fully aseptic environment (Petre et al., 2010; Nicolescu et al., 2009a).
To put into practice this conceptual model of robotic cultivation and integrated processing of mush-
rooms, two zones were designed as the main important areas of the robotic prototype structure. The 
first was designed as being the unsterile zone designed to be served by human operators, dedicated to 
the preliminary processing of substrates, filling the plastic bags with nutritive cultivation substrates, 
loading bags on the transfer devices, and positioning them in front of automated entry gates in the 
processing system.
The second zone was organized to contain four specific sections, established as the sterile zones, 
with specific areas having completely automated functioning. The first section was dedicated to sub-
strate sterilization and robotic inoculation of sterilized substrates in plastic bags with liquid mycelium, 
and the second was designed as the control unit for the inoculated bags, performed by an automated 
vision inspection system, and then their corresponding distribution (Nicolescu et al., 2009b).
The bag distribution area was designed to have three distinct functionalities: evacuation from the 
production system of the transfer devices identified as containing damaged bags; transport of transfer 
devices containing bags identified as being in good shape out of the sterile section in order to be com-
mercialized as the first deliverable products, dedicated to customers interested in developing their own 
mushroom fruiting body production, and the transport of the transfer devices containing the appropri-
ate inoculated bags which are to be placed in the third section, reserved for the growth rooms for fully 
automated incubation and fruiting body formation. Each of these sections may be independently oper-
ated, though they are integrated with the same robotic system for uploading and downloading of the 
transfer devices containing inoculated bags through a set of two storage racks located inside each room 
for incubation or fruit body formation (Petre et al., 2010; Nicolescu et al., 2010a).
As a result, a fully robotic prototype with a modular structure was designed to have an integra-
tive functionality as scalable variants in single or multiple workflows for continuous production and 
processing of plastic bags filled with sterilized organic substrates inoculated with liquid mycelium, as 
well as production of edible and medicinal mushroom fruiting bodies, cultivated on natural substrates 
in growth rooms equipped with automatic devices for leading and controlling the whole process of 
mushroom cultivation (as shown in Figures 4.1 and 4.2).
Such a modular robotic prototype is suitable to for use in continuous controlled cultivation of well-
known mushroom species such as Ganoderma lucidum, Lentinula edodes, Pleurotus ostratus, and 
Pleurotus eryngii, taking into account that these species do not require composted substrates and casing 
layers, and their fruiting bodies emerge all over the surface of cultivation substrates, which are packed 
in plastic bags with a cylindrical shape (Petre et al., 2010).
There are a number of technical problems that the proposed model could solve, such as the prevention 
and removal of any potential sources of infection on producing substrates for mushrooms cultivation, due

Chapter 4  VIRTUAL ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR MUSHROOMS CULTIVATION
to the obvious fact that in the case of “classical” technology of mushroom production there is always a 
potential risk of contamination with pathogens, which could compromise the whole production of mush-
rooms. Also, this modular robotic prototype was designed to ensure high-quality production and food 
safety of the mushrooms produced in a continuous cycle of production, with an increase of economic 
efficiency of 70% compared to other processes and equipment used in conventional cultivation systems.
Through the biotechnological process applied by such a robotic prototype, the disadvantages out-
lined above will be removed, providing for the simultaneous production of bags filled with sterilized 
and inoculated substrates with mycelium as well as the production of mushroom fruiting bodies. The 
technological solution to create more areas for sterile cultivation of mushrooms in continuous modular 
robotic flow was designed so as to allow maximum optimization of production efficiency by ensuring 
the maximum degree of aseptic conditions for mushroom cultivation (Nicolescu et al., 2009b, 2010a).
At the same time, the modular robotic prototype removes other disadvantages mentioned, as the 
equipment in sterile areas ensures automated handling, transfer, storage, sterilization, cooling, and auto-
matic inoculation with mycelium, incubation and fruiting body formation in a controlled atmosphere, 
maintaining optimum and permanent cleaning of air, optimal temperature and relative humidity, harvest-
ing and automatic collection of fruiting bodies, and the washing, disinfection, and collection of wastes 
from incubation and fruit body formation rooms, as well as final processing of the mushrooms produced.
In addition, the previously mentioned prototype keeps a permanent workflow of fully automated 
cultivation, production, and processing of edible and therapeutic mushrooms, eliminating the presence 
of human operators during its deployment, and also permits monitoring and command and control of all 
production parameters in sterile areas and ensures continuous production of sterilized and inoculated 
substrates with mycelium from the plastic bags, as well as the production of mushroom fruiting bod-
ies with maximum food safety and security. In this way, significant savings are achieved per finished 
product unit, and significantly reduced costs of raw materials, energy, and labor, which are reflected 
in by over 100% higher compared to other facilities used now in the cultivation of mushrooms for 
consumption.
Concerning the novelty and originality of this conceptual model, which is already patented, the 
following aspects should be remarked. To avoid any direct human involvement in the production bio-
process, all mushroom cultivation stages, starting from the substrate sterilization and mycelium inocu-
lation, through mycelium incubation and fruiting body formation as well as harvesting, are performed 
using this fully automatic system, which operates inside a completely controlled and 100% aseptic 
environment without any human handling.
The whole bioprocess of mushroom growing does not require any use of pesticides to prevent 
mushroom pathogens and pests. As a result, all harvested mushrooms are produced only by organic 
cultivation with no use of any kind of pesticide, and they are 100% natural products.
Using this robotic prototype produces two sorts of final products to be traded: packed mushrooms to 
be commercialized as fresh food, and plastic bags containing sterilized and inoculated substrates with 
pure liquid mycelium of edible or medicinal mushrooms. At a middle level capacity of an industrial 
plant, the continuous production of sterilized and inoculated substrates packed in plastic bags (250 bags 
per day, every day all through the year) and production of fresh mushroom fruit bodies (1500 kilos per 
month) in a 100% aseptic environment is simultaneously ensured. The exhausted substrates resulting 
from mushroom cultivation can be used directly as feed supplements (containing proteins) or natural 
fertilizers for certain types of soil that are poor in organic substances, closing a short food chain of plant 
waste recycling, making from this point of view a significant contribution to environmental protection.

4.4  MODULAR ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION
4.4  MODULAR ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION AND 
INTEGRATED PROCESSING OF MUSHROOMS
The modular robotic prototype for continuous controlled cultivation and integrated processing of edible 
and medicinal mushrooms was already patented in 2010 (Petre et al., 2010). This prototype is the first 
fully automated system for mushrooms cultivation and integrated processing that has been designed so 
far in mushroom cultivation field.
The use of such a system has a number of technological and economical advantages, such as fully 
preventing human errors by ensuring biotechnological safety through the application of standardized 
conditions of workspace purity in the sterile zones, and guaranteed safety and microbial purity of 
mushroom fruit bodies of cultivated mushroom species as primary organic sources of food and medi-
cines. In addition, this system uses an efficient sterilization method for cultivation substrates by total 
decontamination with microwaves, which is accomplished in a 70% shorter period of time compared 
to pasteurization method and with 40% lower energy costs compared to the classic procedures used in 
existing mushroom farms.
Also, it fully ensures the totally sterile conditions by removal of any hazards regarding human con-
tamination of the workspace, through exclusion of human access to the sterile zones, all the bags being 
handled, transported, sterilized, cooled, transferred, inoculated, and stored; and finally, the mushroom 
fruiting bodies are harvested and processed by modular robotic equipment. All functions of the robotic 
prototype are controlled by a central command system, which also monitors the system parameters 
as well as controllers for the sterilization system, the cooling area, the robotic inoculation system, the 
inoculated bag transfer system, storage systems, the air control systems for the incubation areas, the 
robotic harvesting system, and the final product packing equipment.
The modular robotic prototype for mushroom cultivation was designed to be useful for different 
production variants, with single or multiple workflows, which could include several nonsterile zones 
(ZN-A…ZN-K) for nutritive substrate preparation, as well as several sterile zones (ZS-A…ZS-K) for 
both automatic sterilization and inoculation with liquid mycelium of the solid substrates, followed in 
order by incubation, fruiting body formation, harvesting, and automatic processing of fruiting bodies 
belonging to cultivated mushrooms (Figure 4.3).
The programming and monitoring of each component system as well as the whole modular robotic 
prototype were designed as informatics systems placed in a command room, which is completely iso-
lated from the sterile zones. Human access in the command room was projected to be only through 
the sealing gates and special equipment having the role of eliminating all pathogenic agents and pests 
(Petre et al., 2010; Nicolescu et al., 2010b).

4.4.2  SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGICAL OPERATIONS OF MODULAR ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE
The nonsterile zones, from ZN-A to ZN-I (Figure 4.4), are designed for storage and preliminary pro-
cessing of raw materials needed for the preparation of substrates for mushroom cultivation. ZN-A 
zone includes chopping and milling of substrates as well as soaking and homogenizing systems. 
The next nonsterile zone, B (ZN-B), is served by human operators for filling the bags with cultiva-
tion substrates and fixing supporting devices for sustaining bags on transfer devices such as trans-
port pallets. Nonsterile zone C (ZN-C) is designed for temporary storage of transfer devices for bags. 
The next nonsterile zone, D (ZN-D), is the interface between the last nonsterile zone, ZN-I, and the 
first sterile one, ZS-A, being dedicated for loading the transfer devices of bags on input conveyors, 
which will lead them through the access gates into the sterile automatic processing zones. Nonsterile 
zone E (ZN-E) is placed upstream of the proper cultivation zone. In this area, the bags are collected, 
packed, and transferred to potential mushroom farmers. The next nonsterile zone, F (ZN-F), is used by 
human operators to handle the pallets with the supporting devices after the bags have been unloaded.

59
4.4  MODULAR ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION
Nonsterile zone G (ZN-G) is designed for centralized collection of bags with exhausted substrates 
after the mushroom fruiting bodies have been harvested. Nonsterile zone H (ZN-H) is used to store the 
packed final (post-processed) products, and nonsterile zone I (ZN-I) is designed to allow human access 
to the final product storage area (Petre et al., 2010).
Regarding the sterile zones of the modular robotic prototype, Figure 4.5 presents all sterile areas in 
which are performed all the main technological operations involved in the aseptic inoculation, incuba-
tion, fruiting body formation, harvesting of mushrooms, and their aseptic processing to get the final 
fresh products.
The modular robotic prototype includes sterilization enclosures (9), palletizing systems for auto-
matic manipulation of transfer devices for plastic bags (11, 14, 17), microwave sterilization devices, 
rooms for controlled cooling in aseptic atmosphere of the plastic bags filled with sterilized substrates 
for cultivation (12, 18, 38), a workstation for temporary storage of sterilized bags during the automatic 
inoculation procedure (15), a gantry robot for automatic control of inoculation with liquid mycelia (16), 
video inspection systems for checking the integrity of bags (28a, 29b), and systems for the automatic 
transfer of inoculated bags (28, 31, 32, 35, 37, 46, 52, 53, 54) and redirecting the bags through transfer 
devices (30a, 30b, 30c, 30d) to a collecting station for outdoor delivery of plastic bags filled with steri-
lized compost and inoculated with liquid mycelia (38, 39, 40).
This modular robotic prototype also has incubation and fruiting body formation rooms (49, 50), 
including racks for storage of the transfer devices of bags (48a, 48b, 48c, 48d) and a Cartesian column-
type robot (47) for automatic loading and unloading of the bags through transfer devices, a station for 
pallets stopping and indexing at a fixed point (55), a gantry robot (56) for automatic harvest of mush-
room fruit bodies, four stations for automatic collection and transport of the harvested fruit bodies 
(57a, 57b, 58a, 58b), the systems (62, 63) for palletizing the rack-type pallets containing bags with the 
exhausted substrates (59, 64), and the final processing systems (69a, 69b) for the harvested mushroom 
fruit bodies (Petre et al., 2010).
Sterile zone A (ZS-A) includes a microwave oven area (9) for thermal sterilization of the bags filled 
with cultivation substrates. Zone B (ZS-B) has as its main structure an automatic transfer system (11), 
which moves the pallets from zone A (ZS-A) to zone C (ZS-C), including the controlled cooling area 
(12). The second automatic transfer system moves the pallets from the cooling area (12) to the tempo-
rary storage area (15) included in zone D (ZS-D). In zone E (ZS-E), a gantry robot with three degrees of 
freedom (16) allows simultaneous or successively controlled inoculation with liquid mycelium inside 
of three bags stored on a transfer device (Figure 4.5). After inoculation, the third automatic transfer 
system (17), located in sterile zone F (ZS-F), carries the pallets through a transfer gate (18) from zone 
G (ZS-G) into sterile zone H (ZS-H). The programming and monitoring of the automatic functioning 
of each system and of the entire robotic prototype (from sterile zone A to the sterile zone G) is done 
by informatics systems (20) located in the control room (21), which is completely separate from the 
nonsterile zones previously mentioned (Figure 4.4).
Zone H (ZS-H) includes three visual control systems for automated examination of bags for physi-
cal integrity after sterilization and inoculation processes and before their transfer and loading into the 
incubation and fruit body formation rooms located in I (ZS-I) zone. If the visual control system con-
firms the full integrity of the bags, they are transported by conveyors (28, 30, 46) through the Cartesian 
column-type robot unit (47) for automated loading into the storage racks (48a, 48b, 48c, 48d). If inad-
equate bags are identified on a transfer device, they are evacuated through the redirecting systems 
(30a, 30b) for extraction from further processing workflow, by means of the special conveyor sections 
(31, 32), the bag transfer device being leaded to nonsterile zone D (ZN-D).

61
4.4  MODULAR ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION
All fully processed bags, once loaded with sterilized substrates and inoculated with mycelium, 
are evacuated by a system which contains the transporter (28), the pallet redirecting device (30a), the 
transporter (37), and the gate (38). The bags are transferred to the incubation rooms in zone I (ZS-I) 
by the transporters (45, 46). An automated system for transfer and transport (47) loads the four storage 
systems (48a, 48b, 48c, 48d) and places them in two incubation rooms. After the bags are unloaded 
from the storage systems, the incubation rooms are cleaned, washed, and sterilized by the system (47). 
At the same time, the disinfecting liquids and the wastes resulting from the harvest process are removed 
through gravitational collection systems on the ground.
The inoculation robot (56) includes a rectangular gantry system sustained by eight poles and two 
mobile trolleys sliding on a cross mounted on the gantry structure; one trolley has a vertical slide with a 
gripper (in order to manipulate the bags), and the other trolley has a vertical slide with an end-effector 
that harvests the mushrooms from the surface of bags (3, 5).
The mushrooms are finally collected by the flat band conveyors (58a, 58b). The bags containing 
exhausted substrates are evacuated by the rack-type pallets (59, 64), the palletizing systems (62, 63), 
as well as the ground transfer system (65) and some sliding access doors. There is also a system that 
evacuates the bag-sustaining pallets, which is composed of the transporter (54), the pallet redirecting 
system (30c), the transporter (53), the pallet redirecting system (30d), the transporter (68), the pallet 
redirecting system (30b), and the transporters (32, 35) (Figure 4.5).
The entire robotic prototype is controlled by a central command system, which also controls the 
system parameters and the specific controllers of the sterilizing system, the cooling area, the robotic 
inoculation system, the evacuation system for inoculated bags, the pallet moving, transfer, transport, 
and storage systems, the climatic systems for the incubation and fruit body formation rooms, the robotic 
harvest system, and the packing equipment for final products.
4.4.3  THE ROBOT OF INOCULATION
The gantry robot with three degrees of freedom has the role of inoculating mycelium in the plastic 
bags loaded with sterilized substrates. For this purpose, this type of robot will gradually take a posi-
tion above each inoculation post, and the end-effectors will perform the operation of introducing the 
liquid mycelium inside the content of each group of three bags. The needed amount of mycelium for 
inoculation is downloaded from a low-capacity collector, which is provided with a device for continu-
ous homogenization of its content, and transferred to the final injection devices by a pump and several 
injectors. After inoculation, the robot will retract to a “home position,” allowing the recharge of the 
collector from a main storage tank of mycelium through a pipeline with direct connection.
The robot is specially designed for working in a sterile environment and has three degrees of free-
dom, as follows: X longitudinal axis, Y transversal axis, and Z vertical axis. The drive system is com-
posed of electrical motors, and the programming is done through teach-in techniques (Nicolescu et al., 
2010a,b).
The automatic inoculation with liquid mycelium of the bags loaded with sterile compost is done in 
sterile zone ZS-E, which includes temporary storage posts for pallets loaded with transfer supports of 
bags and a gantry robot with three degrees of freedom. The robot (Figure 4.6) is specially designed for 
inoculation, being equipped with a multiple end-effector (Figure 4.7), which may operate by simultane-
ously injecting a controlled volume of liquid mycelium in all the bags placed on the same support or 
successively injecting each of them. Before the inoculation, the end-effector is positioned according

4.4  MODULAR ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION
to the coordinates of palette location on the temporary storage post. After the inoculation process is 
completed, the pallets are automatically transferred from zone ZS-E to zone ZS-G by another transfer 
system placed in zone ZS-F. This transfer system takes the pallets from the temporary storage posts 
and introduces them into the transfer gate placed in zone ZS-G. The transfer gate is equipped with two 
vertically sliding doors (Nicolescu et al., 2009b, 2010a).
4.4.4  THE ROBOTIC HARVESTING CELL
Once the pallets with bags containing emerged mushroom fruit bodies reach the robotic harvesting area, 
a specially designed gantry robot with two end-effectors allows the picking-up of each bag with fruiting 
bodies from the pallet/support, using a first end-effector, transport of the bags to the collecting tables 
and evacuation conveyors, mushroom harvesting (using a second specially designed end-effector), and, 
finally, the transport of bags and their storage in a specially designed support/pallet system for collec-
tion and automatic transport of bags outside the sterile area. The central element of the robotic harvest-
ing cell (Figure 4.8) is a specially designed gantry robot equipped with two end-effectors, having a total 
of 5 NC axes. Two of these are set as independent Z-axes, two as independent Y-axes, and one as a com-
mon X-axis. Each Z-axis is equipped with a specific end-effector, one designed for manipulation and 
transport of bags and the second for mushroom harvesting (Nicolescu et al., 2010a,b). To pick up the 
bags from the pallet/support and transport them to the harvest area, a three-finger gripper was designed,

powered by an electric actuator (Figure 4.9), while for the harvesting of mushroom fruit bodies a spe-

harvesting robot equipped with both end-effectors.

4.4  MODULAR ROBOTIC PROTOTYPE FOR CONTINUOUS CULTIVATION
However, the harvesting of mushroom fruit bodies represents a difficult task due to their non-uniform 
shapes and sizes on the surface of bags. To overcome this difficulty, a completely new technical solu-
tion was designed for a “harvesting end-effector with self-adaptive sliding blades,” both closing and 
opening of end-effector being done by a bilateral electric actuator. The self-adaptive sliding blades of 
the harvesting end-effector have been designed using standardized mechanical components (Nicolescu 
et al., 2009b, 2010a).
After the harvesting operation is accomplished by the gantry robot, the depleted bags are trans-
ported to a storage pallet, which is led outside the sterile area of the facility and replaced with an empty 
one using the pallet transfer system and roller conveyors.

4.5  CONCLUSIONS
The modular robotic prototype presented, already patent protected, is the first fully automated system 
for continuous controlled cultivation and integrated processing of mushrooms.
Through its application at the industrial plant level, this system guarantees the nutritional and 
microbiological safety of final products by ensuring all standardized conditions of workspace purity 
in the sterile zones and also by preventing human error in the sterile zones, ensuring biotechnological 
safety. In the workflow put into practice by this prototype, efficient methods of sterilizing the cultiva-
tion substrates are used, involving total decontamination with microwaves, which is accomplished in a 
time 70% shorter and with energy costs lower by 40% compared to the “classical” procedures.
This robotic system fully ensures the total sterile conditions imposed by appropriate biological mate-
rial cultivation, eliminating any hazards regarding human contamination of the workspace. Also, it pre-
vents human access to the sterile zones, because the bag handling, transport, transfer, storage, inoculation, 
cooling, sterilizing, harvesting, and other operations are performed by modular robotic equipment.
All functions of installations and devices are effected by a central command system, which also 
controls the parameters for the sterilizing system, the cooling area, the robotic inoculation system, 
the evacuation system for inoculated bags, the pallet handling, transfer, transport, and storage systems, 
the control systems for air and temperature inside the incubation and fruiting body formation areas, the 
robotic harvesting system, and the packaging equipment for final products.
Concerning the novelty and originality of this conceptual model already patented, the following 
aspects should be remarked. To avoid any direct human involvement in the production bioprocess, 
all mushroom cultivation stages, starting from the substrate sterilization and mycelium inoculation, 
through mycelium incubation and fruiting body formation, as well as mushroom harvesting, are per-
formed using this fully automatic system, which operates inside a completely controlled and 100% 
aseptic environment without any human handling.
The whole bioprocess of mushroom growing does not require any use of pesticides to prevent 
mushroom pathogens and pests. As a result, all harvested mushrooms are produced by organic cultiva-
tion only, with no use of any kind of pesticides, and they are 100% natural products.
Using this robotic prototype achieves two sorts of final products to be traded: packed mushrooms to 
be commercialized as fresh food, and plastic bags containing sterilized and inoculated substrates with 
pure liquid mycelium of edible or medicinal mushrooms.
At a middle level capacity in an industrial plant, the continuous production of sterilized and inocu-
lated substrates packed in plastic bags (250 bags per day, every day all through the year) and production 
of fresh mushroom fruit bodies (1500 kilos per month) in 100% aseptic environment are simultane-
ously ensured.
The exhausted substrates resulting from mushroom cultivation can be directly used as feed supple-
ments (containing proteins) or natural fertilizers for certain types of soil that are poor in organic sub-
stances, closing a short food chain of plant waste recycling, making from this point of view a significant 
contribution to environmental protection.

5.1  INTRODUCTION
Mushrooms have been consumed by humans since ancient times as a part of the normal diet and as 
a delicacy due to their desirable taste and aroma. In addition, mycotherapy has been used for a long 
time and currently is receiving increasing interest in Europe for prevention and treatment purposes. 
Consequently, humans have developed cultivation methods that yield abundant and constant resources 
of specific edible and medicinal mushrooms. All over the world, cultivated mushrooms are mainly sap-
rotrophic species, being grown on various agroindustrial wastes. Increasing cultivation of mushrooms 
may then contribute to the development of a new agriculture and address consumer demand for healthy 
products. This may satisfy the three interrelated dimensions of sustainable development as proposed 
by the United Nation Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20): environmental, economic, 
and social. According to the UN Environmental Programme, “Innovative and green technologies can 
simultaneously increase employment, foster better use of science and traditional knowledge, upscale 
provision of basic services, and at the same time protect the environment” (UNEP Post 2015 #1: http://
ozone.unep.org/Publications/UNEP_Post_2015_Note1.pdf). Progress in mushroom science will help 
the mushroom industry to address these objectives.
Despite the button mushroom having been cultivated for centuries, recent progress in scientific 
knowledge of the fungal species Agaricus bisporus offers new opportunities to innovate cultivation 
processes with a contribution to a sustainable agriculture as a target. The history of button mushroom 
cultivation is uncertain. There is some reason to suspect cultivation of agarics in ancient Egypt and 
then Greece. An Egyptian wall painting indicated that they cultivated an Agaricus sp. strain. In France, 
during the seventeenth century, the cultivation of what was probably A. bisporus had been developed. 
One story explains that Jean-Baptiste La Quintinie, an expert gardener and agronomist at that time, 
who created the vegetable garden at Chateau de Versailles, cultivated button mushrooms for the French 
King Louis XIV. What is undoubtedly known is that at the beginning of the eighteenth century, cultures

were developed in cellars and underground below the buildings of Paris, and then moved into caves and 
stone quarries around Paris and in the Loire Valley in France. It is now cultivated all over the world in 
temperate areas. Past and recent research on the ecology, biology, genetics, and cultivation techniques 
of this mushroom opens new possibilities for the production of this common fungal species under vari-
ous conditions, having sustainable development as an objective.
The control of pests and pathogens by biological treatments in place of pesticides as well as by the 
use of resistant cultivars are significant strategies to reach this objective. This is the topic of the following 
chapter in this volume. The present chapter gives, on the one hand, an overview of the improvement of 
agro-waste valorization in A. bisporus cultivation, and, on the other hand, progress in biodiversity pres-
ervation and utilization, as well as developments in genetics are highlighted through the interest in pro-
ducing strains able to fruit at high temperatures and having health promoting action and low safety risks.
5.2  THE IMPROVEMENT OF AGRO-WASTE VALORIZATION
Edible and medicinal mushrooms are cultivated on lignocellulosic residues, and the economic value 
of their recycling with these fungal species is considerable. The wastes can be viewed as reusable 
materials, at least in terms of providing new economic opportunities and positive environmental con-
sequences. Contrary to other cultivated mushrooms, such as Lentinula edodes and Pleurotus spp., 
A. bisporus is not a lignicolous species, rather, it is a leaf-litter degrading white-rot basidiomycete 
acting as a secondary decomposer. Forest litter decomposition is usually initiated by generalist primary 
colonizers involving a diverse community of fungi and bacteria which utilize simple sugars, oligosac-
charides, and other low molecular weight compounds. After this initial flush of microbial activity, 
specialist secondary colonizers, which are less competitive than the microfungi in exploiting labile 
resources (Frankland, 1992), develop via the decomposition of more recalcitrant plant polymers such 
as lignocellulose complexes and humic compounds formed during the first phase of decomposition. 
Taking into account these ecological traits, the cultivation of A. bisporus is conventionally performed 
by inoculating pre-decomposed substrates obtained by composting. Composting is a human action 
which is designed to accelerate the process of complex organic matter decomposition by the action of 
microbial communities under high temperature, high humidity, and oxygenation. For the cultivation of 
A. bisporus, the overall goal of composting is to produce a selective nutrient medium for mushroom 
growing (Miller, 1993). This refers to both chemical and biological aspects that must be managed to 
obtain the conversion of raw agricultural wastes into compost which is more resistant to degradation 
and inhabited by a steady microbiota (Savoie et al., 1993). The two controllers that can be activated to 
reach the composting goals are the quality of raw materials and the physicochemical conditions during 
the process. Improving the valorization of agro-wastes by cultivation of A. bisporus with sustainable 
development as an objective leads to the use of local resources in composting processes that are envi-
ronmentally safe and energetically moderate.
5.2.1  THE USE OF LOCAL RESOURCES
Wheat straw and horse manure including straw have been the major components of mushroom compost 
formulations for a long time in Western countries. Other cereal straws (rice, oat, barley) and sugarcane 
bagasse are used as lignocellulosic materials in other countries, when these wastes are locally available. 

71
5.2  The Improvement of Agro-Waste Valorization
Horse manure is an important ingredient of compost for supplying both microorganisms and nitrogen 
plus some minerals. In fact, the C/N ratio is an index that has to be taken into account in the choice 
of raw ingredients. Optimal values in the cultivation substrate are around 20 (Sharma and Kilpatrick, 
2000). Due to degradation during composting, this value can be reached when the C/N ratio in the 
mixture of raw materials is at 40–60. This means that nitrogen sources have to be added to the straw 
or bagasse (C/N > 100). Due to the limited availability of horse manure in large amounts around the 
world, composts whose formulations are prepared without the addition of this manure but using other 
nitrogen-rich materials are proposed. They must provide the compost microbiota with readily available 
N sources for their growth, and this nitrogen is transformed into more stable forms in the microbial bio-
mass. For instance, ammonium nitrate or urea must be added at the outset of the composting process. 
Poultry manure, cereal grains and bran, and oilseeds are also commonly used, with soybean being the 
most often used in countries where available (Zied et al., 2011). Soybean or other seed meals may be 
treated to delay the immediate availability of nutrients. However, chemical compounds such as formal-
dehyde have been used for this purpose, which is not in agreement with the objectives of sustainable 
development due to the toxicity of this product.
As an illustration of the use of local resources for both nitrogen-rich compounds and lignocellu-
losic materials, Andrade et al. (2008) worked on formulations with soybean mill and urea as a nitrogen 
source and compared three lignocellulosic materials available in Brazil (two varieties of Cynodon dac-
tylon straw and oat straw) mixed with sugarcane bagasse. Mushroom productivity with four A. bisporus 
strains varied from 7 to 18 kg mushroom/100 kg compost. Different types of raw materials can be used 
depending on their availability, but experiments are needed to define the best formulae for growing a 
specific strain under local conditions. The quality of materials is known to influence compost ability 
to support high yields of mushrooms. It may be variable, even with the same ingredient such as wheat 
straw. It has been shown that the geographical source, the variety, and agronomical practices such as 
use of growth regulators or fungicides affect straw quality and may have consequences for the compost-
ing process and mushroom yields (Savoie et al., 1992, 1993, 1997).
Apart from the raw ingredients of compost, the casing material is an environmental issue. Covering 
the colonized compost with a casing layer is the way to induce the production of fruiting bodies. In 
Western countries peat moss is used alone, or in a mixture with calcareous materials as the casing mate-
rial. Peat is forming very slowly in natural wetlands, which are sources of pure water and ecological 
reserves for many plants and animals. Mining peat in these ecosystems for the mushroom industry is 
an environmental problem, and peat availability is a great concern in some regions around the world. It 
is a great challenge to find a substitute that is available in volume and at low cost to meet the demands 
of mushroom production (Colauto et al., 2011). The casing layer provides the support and storage of 
water for developing mushrooms and protects the substrate from desiccation; it adsorbs volatile and 
other chemical components produced by the vegetative mycelium of A. bisporus and provides for cer-
tain beneficial bacteria. Alternatives to peat used alone or in mixture for decreasing the quantity of peat 
have been tested and sometimes practically used, including soil (clay-loam), vermiculite, weathered 
mushroom compost, activated carbon, bagasse and filter cake, coconut fiber, among others (Bechara 
et al., 2009b; Siyoum et al., 2010). In the mushroom industry, aerated steam treatment of casing is rec-
ommended to reduce the incidence of mushroom pests, but with low intensity and followed by a delay 
before use, for substrate recolonization by beneficial microorganisms. Such pasteurization might also 
suppress pathogens of the human body that would contaminate the mushrooms. Soil fumigation might 
also be used for cleaning the casing material, but there is a lack of environmental friendly fumigants. 

72
Chapter 5  A. BISPORUS: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
Whereas these treatments are mandatory with soil-based and spent-mushroom compost casing, they 
might be avoided with other materials, saving energy and cost.
Finally, the use of new local resources as raw ingredients for composting and the casing layer is pos-
sible and is environmental friendly, but it needs years of experience for the development of mushroom 
cultivation at a commercial scale, with mushroom production reaching the standards of quality and 
yields of the places where A. bisporus has been cultivated for a long time. The path of commercializa-
tion, social issues, and economic balance also contribute to the choice of the use of local raw materials.
5.2.2  FROM OUTDOOR TO INDOOR COMPOSTING
Since the 1950s, conventional composting has been carried out in two steps. Phase I is an initial step 
carried out outdoors with rather limited process control, while phase II is a conditioning step carried 
out indoors under generally well-defined process controls (Miller, 1993).
After a pre-wetting period, ingredients are mixed and phase I is driven in long rectangular stacks 
for 1–2 weeks. Phase I is both biological and chemical, with the breakdown of organic substrates for 
energy supply and incorporation into microbial biomass being the crucial mechanisms (Figure 5.1). 
Composting is mainly an aerobic process, but during phase I, anaerobic areas develop in the inner 
parts of stacks (Miller et al., 1989). In addition, temperature increases due to microbial activity, and in 
some parts temperatures might reach extreme values greater than 70°C, which, with an atmosphere rich 
in ammonia, results in partial sterilization (Miller et al., 1989). On the other hand, high temperature 
and high ammonia levels make the lignocellulosic components of compost more readily available for 
microbial degradation and stabilize nitrogen resources into steady forms (Savoie et al., 1996b). For 
management of both aeration and temperature, the stacks are turned frequently. This turning mixes the 
different parts of the stacks and introduces successive cycles of raw ingredient transformation, which 
enhances the overall microbial activity and tends to foster better homogenization of the substrate.
Research since the early 1960s has been devoted to techniques for preparing high-quality mush-
room compost in the shortest possible time. Meanwhile, large composting facilities were developed 
in Western countries and residents began to complain about composting odors. At the same time there 
was an increasing demand from the public for ecologically acceptable production techniques, with a 
focus on water quality and chemical pollution. As a consequence, several methods of indoor compost-
ing were developed and experimented with. They helped to clarify the biological mechanisms involved 
during composting, mushroom growth, and fruiting. However, empirical approaches allowed the rapid 
development of indoor composting in tunnels on a large industrial scale in Italy, Austria, Australia, and 
the Netherlands (Laborde et al., 1993). During indoor composting, the odors can be trapped before air 
is vented to the outside, and the climatic parameters of the process are controlled. The calories pro-
duced can be used for heating the tunnels and other buildings. Nowadays, growers across the world 
have adopted this environmentally friendly way of making compost in a short time because of the good 
results obtained by adequately managing the climatic parameters. This reaches the objectives of sus-
tainable development by saving time, energy, raw materials, and space, by improving sanitary control 
and favoring the stabilization of compost and mushroom quality. However, the main problem is that it 
means sophisticated facilities with computerized monitoring and management. The technology might 
be available for small local growers, but it requires a grouping of several growers in cooperatives or 
other sharing structures.

73
5.2  The Improvement of Agro-Waste Valorization
At the midterm between indoor and outdoor phase I composting, new devices for aerated wind-
row have been developed for improved rapid composting procedures. These generally use polyvinyl 
chloride pipes with holes drilled at various distances and positioned in different parts of the windrows, 
providing either forced or passive aeration (Song et al., 2014; Wakchaure et al., 2014).
5.2.3  REUSE OF THE SAME COMPOST SEVERAL TIMES
Mushrooms are produced in a series of breaks or flushes at one-week intervals. After the second break, 
each successive flush produces fewer mushrooms due to the depletion of available nutrients in the 
compost. Compost supplementation with nitrogen-rich nutrients having delayed release and mixed in 
compost at spawning or casing can limit this phenomenon (Zied et al., 2011), but it is theoretically less 
efficient than regular injection of nutrients during the culture. This was experimented with in the 1960s 
(San Antonio, 1966) but not implemented.

Chapter 5  A. BISPORUS: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
More recently, Royse and collaborators, renewing an old idea (Schisler, 1990), developed a meth-
odology to obtain additional yield of mushrooms from compost after one or two flushes, which may 
help to reduce production costs and reduce the amount of spent mushroom compost requiring disposal: 
double-cropping (Royse et al., 2008; Royse and Sanchez, 2008a,b; Royse and Chalupa, 2009). This 
requires removing the casing layer after one, two, or three breaks and incorporating various supple-
ments into the first crop compost (Royse, 2010; Royse et al., 2008). Then the compost is recondi-
tioned and re-cased. In various attempts to improve the double-cropping method, the authors showed 
that addition of spawn had the effect of supplementation but was not enough, and other supplements 
were used with higher efficiencies. Addition of 20% of phase II compost for introducing new nutrients 
and balancing the loss of dry matter during the first crop was experimented with. It proved efficient 
when supplements were added and thoroughly mixed with de-cased first crop compost (Royse, 2010). 
Compost fragmentation proved to be efficient in improving the yield of the second crop. Finally, by 
using de-cased compost collected after two flushes of harvest, fragmented and mixed with commercial 
supplements, second crops of two flushes may reach the same level of yield per m² as the first crops. 
Double-cropping could help growers become more efficient and competitive, and ensure sustainability 
of production by increasing the efficiency of raw material use. However, the risks of pathogen transmis-
sion from crop to crop may limit the use of the double-cropping, though Royse and Chalupa (2009) did 
not notice any interference from potential pests and pathogens.
5.2.4  A CULTIVATION SUBSTRATE WITHOUT COMPOSTING?
Composting being a source of some environmental drawbacks and loss of raw materials before inocu-
lation of A. bisporus, early in the 1960s, some methods were developed for mushroom cultivation on 
non-composted substrates. Till (1962) succeeded with sterilized complex substrates by maintaining 
axenic conditions up to fruiting. This was the first report of Agaricus cultivation on a non-composted 
substrate (NCS). This NCS was the subject of various studies, with some patents registered, showing it 
is possible to cultivate A. bisporus on NCS; however, formulas and techniques need to be optimized and 
the economic balance needs to be improved before commercial development is achieved. The main-
tenance of sterile conditions being technically complex and costly, another approach was carried out. 
This method directly uses grain spawn normally used for inoculating A. bisporus in compost and adds 
a casing layer onto it (San Antonio, 1971; Bechara et al., 2006). Using commercial millet grain spawn 
to which a delayed-release supplement was added, experiments were conclusive at the laboratory scale 
(Bechara et al., 2009a).
NCS without sterilization was also experimented with. Sanchez and Royse (2001) reported a pro-
cedure for preparing mushroom substrate without composting of ingredients used for the cultivation 
of shiitake and with a nonsterile phase for fruiting induction. Fermentation processes (Huhnke and 
Sengbush, 1968), or reinoculation of pasteurized substrates (8 h at 60°C) with specific thermophile 
microorganisms (Sanchez et al., 2008; Coello-Castillo et al., 2009), were also tested. The objective was 
focused on inhibiting and preventing the subsequent development of microorganisms which could be 
compete with the cultivated mushroom. These techniques used various raw materials that were locally 
available, such as pergola grass or corn cobs in Mexico (Sanchez et al., 2008; Sanchez and Royse, 
2009), but require the production of pure inoculum of Scytalidium thermophilum, a thermophile fungus 
known to contribute to the selectivity of composts and to enhance yields of A. bisporus. However, sup-
plementation of substrate at casing is required for correct yields (Coello-Castillo et al., 2009).

75
5.3  The Preservation and Management of Biological Diversity
With NCS developed up to now, yields are rather low compared to traditional compost, and the eco-
nomic balance of the process is not in favor of development to large-scale production, but this original 
method of mushroom production is worth studying, as are new composting processes for the improve-
ment of sustainable agricultural waste valorization through A. bisporus cultivation.
5.3  THE PRESERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
5.3.1  THE LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY IN CULTIVATED LINES
All cultivated crops and domesticated animals have resulted from the human management of biologi-
cal diversity, and their continuous evolution through improvement by breeders and farmers constantly 
responds to new challenges to maintain and increase productivity. In this respect, cultivated mushrooms 
are no exception. The scientific names given to the button mushroom have changed several times, 
finally stabilizing 70 years ago (in 1946) as A. bisporus (J.E. Lange) Imbach (Table 5.1), but one can 
speculate that the same biological species has been cultivated since its first appearance in France at the 
end of the seventeenth century, with improvements to increase productivity.
After the first cultivation, mushroom growers’ selection for desirable characteristics, such as faster 
growth and yield or color, has dramatically changed the cultivated button mushroom compared to its 
native relatives. Growers used selected mushrooms for inoculating subsequent cultures and accumu-
lated some characteristics over time. With the easy vegetative dissemination of A. bisporus and the pos-
sibility of storing mycelium alive for months, the diversity in cultivated strains decreased rapidly. In the 
second part of the twentieth century, all the cultivated strains of A. bisporus came from five ancestral 
lineages defined by phenotypes as “off white,” “small white,” “white,” “brown,” “small brown,” and 
“golden white.” The lineages, which are genetically different, have a European origin (Xu et al., 1997; 
Royse and May, 1982; Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2009). The first hybrids, Horst® U1 and Horst® U3, were 
obtained in the 1980s in the Netherlands by crossing “white” and “off white” cultivars. Except for a 
hybrid developed during the 1980s in China (Wang et al., 1995), no new white hybrids with genetic 
backgrounds different from Horst® U1 and Horst® U3 have been developed since (Foulongne-Oriol 
et al., 2011b; Sonnenberg et al., 2011). White hybrids derived from these original ones are cultivated 
widely throughout the world. As a result, A. bisporus is nearly a monolineage crop.
Today, the lack of diversity in cultivated strains of the button mushroom is considered an important 
risk for this culture, and efforts have been made over the past 30 years to overcome this problem. The

Chapter 5  A. BISPORUS: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
native crop relatives and local varieties are the elements of agricultural biodiversity most likely to con-
tain the high levels of genetic diversity and biological novelty needed to sustain innovations in breed-
ing programs. This implies preservation of the native resources and an evaluation of their genetic and 
phenotypic diversity, which are significant components of the development of a sustainable agriculture.
5.3.2  THE NATIVE RESERVOIR OF BIODIVERSITY
The native populations of fungi are undoubtedly very important for the productive sector of cultivated 
mushrooms because individuals physiologically adapted to certain substrates and environmental condi-
tions provide the genetic variation necessary to potentiate desirable characteristics for the commercial 
sector (Salmones and Mata, 2012). However, in developing countries, and especially in tropical and 
subtropical areas, which harbor enormous biological diversity, few government agencies have shown 
interest in supporting regular and organized research on knowledge, conservation, management, and 
implementation of fungi as a genetic resource. It would be appropriate to avoid the study of native 
germplasm of an isolated and disintegrated form, and instead encourage efforts to collect, review, 
analyze, and integrate the different aspects of edible mushrooms in order to obtain a real picture of 
the strengths, problems, needs, and current priorities. Strain collections are fundamental tools for the 
development of research currently being carried out in the area of cultivation of edible fungi. Existing 
collections are dedicated to maintaining mycelia and safeguarding related information. Some of these 
collections provide deposit services, identification, and authentication of the strains. According to data 
from the World Federation of Culture Collections (WFCC, 2015), there are 678 collections of micro-
organisms distributed over 71 countries. In these collections about 2.5 million strains are safeguarded, 
and approximately 30% of the strains (725,000) correspond to fungi. The American Type Culture 
Collection (ATCC) holds approximately 56,000 strains of fungi and yeasts, among which are 427 
strains of Agaricus, many of which do not have data about their origin or are copies of the same strain 
sheltered in collections of other countries. Other collections not registered in the WFCC also exist.
In the 1980s, there appear to have been fewer than 20 independent lines of A. bisporus in mainstream 
culture collections worldwide, including those of commercial laboratories (Kerrigan, 1996). Mycologists 
had not reported the species in their native form for a while. Collecting the native strains and their pres-
ervation in germplasms appeared necessary to R.W. Kerrigan in North America and P. Callac in Europe 
(Kerrigan, 1996; Callac et al., 2002), because there was concern about losing their genetic diversity 
forever. With the contribution of some mycological societies, mycologists, and researchers from many 
countries, and thanks to specific collaborative programs, more than 600 native specimens have been col-
lected from their natural environments and preserved in two collections: the ARP (Agaricus Resource 
Program) in the United States (Kerrigan, 1996) and the CGAB (Collection du Germoplasme des Agarics 
à Bordeaux) in France (Callac et al., 2002). Currently, native strains are also preserved in collections 
of various universities and research institutions. The geographic distribution of the germplasm mainly 
covers Europe, the Mediterranean region, and North America. However, native strains also have been 
collected from the Tibetan Plateau (Wang et al., 2008) and other places in Asia, South America, and 
the Middle East (Malekzadeh et al., 2011). The known geographic range of the species extends from 
the equatorial climate of Congo (Heinemann, 1956) to the boreal region of Alaska (Geml et al., 2008). 
Unfortunately, no living specimen from extreme climates is available in free culture collections.
Recently, A. bisporus obtained the status of a model fungus for its adaptation, persistence, and 
growth in the humic-rich leaf-litter environment (Morin et al., 2012). The leaf litter of Cupressus spp. 

77
5.3  The Preservation and Management of Biological Diversity
was identified as a good habitat for isolating native strains in various countries (Figure 5.2). The needle 
litter of Picea, plant wastes, and manures in fields or parks also furnished numerous native strains. 
However, A. bisporus has been found in various habitats such as in coastal dunes in France or under 
Prosopis and Tamarix in arid place of the Sonoran Desert, California, USA (Kerrigan, 1995; Xu et al., 
1997; Callac et al., 2002). In light of this, adaptation of geographical populations and/or varieties of 
the species to different climates and habitats could be expected (Largeteau et al., 2011). This ability is 
associated with genetic diversity for the use of the native isolates as new sources of breeding material 
to restore genetic variability in cultivars. Preserving the habitats where A. bisporus is frequently found 
should be a way to maintain the natural reservoir of diversity for this mushroom species. Unfortunately, 
such habitats are frequently threatened by extreme climatic events and human activity. That is the case 
of cypress forests in coastal areas in Europe and North America. Development of a durable germplasm 
is increasingly of concern for A. bisporus biodiversity preservation.
5.3.3  GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC RICHNESS OF GERMPLASMS
Genetic studies on native mushroom populations have revealed a large diversity, and three varieties hav-
ing different life cycles were identified. Agaricus bisporus is an amphitallic species with a homothallic 
or heterothallic cycle depending on the ploidy level of the spores, which can be heterokaryotic (n + n) 
or homokaryotic (n) (Figure 5.3). Each dominant life cycle is characteristic of a variety. The cultivated 
strains and most of the native strains belong to A. bisporus var. bisporus, which has a predominantly 
pseudohomothallic life cycle. In this life cycle, most of the basidia are bisporic and produce heterokary-
otic spores, giving rise to fertile heterokaryons able to produce fruiting bodies, whereas plasmogamy 
between two sexually compatible homokaryons is needed to restore a fertile heterokaryon in the amphi-
thallic life cycle of A. bisporus var. burnettii (Kerrigan et al., 1994) (Figure 5.3). The variety burnettii 
FIGURE 5.2

78
Chapter 5  A. BISPORUS: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
was discovered in the Sonoran Desert of California (Callac et al., 1993), and up to now it has been 
restricted to this local population. The basidia are mostly tetrasporic and the variety is completely inter-
fertile with the variety bisporus. A homothallic life cycle in which homokaryotic sporophores produce 
homokaryotic spores giving rise to fertile homokaryons has been found in rare tetrasporic specimens 
in France and in Greece. They belong to the same clonal colony and are the only known members of  
A. bisporus var. eurotetrasporus (Callac et al., 2003).
In a survey of genetic diversity in North American populations with molecular markers, 144 dif-
ferent nuclear haplotypes were characterized, showing a wide genetic diversity, but many strains had 
the same 10 mitochondrial haplotypes as the traditional cultivars originating in Europe. Among such 
cultivar-like isolates, nuclear genetic divergence between geographical populations was significantly 
less pronounced than among the strains that do not bear such haplotypes (Kerrigan et al., 1998). This

5.3  The Preservation and Management of Biological Diversity
suggested that certain populations, such as those of the California coast, are contaminated by cultivars 
via outcrossing since nuclear genotypes of cultivars are rarely found in the wild (Kerrigan et al., 1998), 
whereas other populations such as that of Alberta in Canada have proven to be relatively uncontami-
nated by cultivar-like genotypes (Xu et al., 1997). From these results the question of the contamination 
of the native populations has arisen and spurred mycologists to preserve the biodiversity of A. bisporus 
in a germplasm.
Xu et al. (2002) analyzed the genetic diversity of samples from two local populations in the west 
of France over a two-year period. One site (50 × 70 m) was a field frequently receiving horse manure; 
the other site, 450 km away, was under Monterey cypress trees, Cupressus macrocarpa. High levels of 
genetic variation were recorded in each population, with the largest potential clonal colony found in 
no more than 1 m². Genetic drift, hybridization between neighboring individuals, and gene flow among 
populations could contribute to genotypic changes over a period of years. The significant genetic dif-
ferentiation between the two sites, however, suggested that long-distance gene flow was relatively 
limited. It might also be due to differences in the ability of each population to develop in the habitat of 
the other. This was observed by Savoie et al. (1996a) in a study on the ability to colonize and degrade 
mushroom compost made from horse manure using isolates of these two local populations. The strains 
from the cypress litter were less efficient at compost colonization, whereas their ability to resist or to 
adapt to metabolites of Trichoderma spp., which is an antagonist of A. bisporus in cultures on compost, 
was higher than that from the open area confronted with horse manure on a field (Savoie et al., 2008b). 
By comparing various European native strains of A. bisporus, the litter of Cupressus sempervirens and 
the climatic conditions associated with the development of this tree in Mediterranean regions appeared 
to select for strains of A. bisporus with low susceptibility to Trichoderma spp. metabolites (Savoie 
et al., 2008b). Resistance to pests and pathogens is searched for in native relatives of cultivars with the 
expectation of introducing such resistance in cultivated strains and then protecting the culture without 
using pesticides (Chapter 6).
In addition to adaptation to the cultivation substrate and resistance to pathogen attacks, thermo-
tolerance is an important trait for the promotion of sustainable production of the button mushroom. 
A large sample of native strains representing the major geographical populations of A. bisporus was 
screened for the ability to produce mature fruiting bodies at a higher temperature (25°C) than the 
normal temperature (17–19°C) used for the induction of fruiting in commercial cultures (Largeteau 
et al., 2011). One quarter of the strains of A. bisporus var. bisporus were able to fruit at high tem-
perature, but with significantly lower yields than at the normal temperature for most. No correlation 
between either habitat or climate and the frequency of thermo-tolerant strains was found (Largeteau 
et al., 2011). All the A. bisporus var. burnettii strains originating from the Sonoran Desert produced 
high yields of fruiting bodies at 25°C, and some strains retain this ability at 30°C (Navarro and Savoie, 
2015). Apparently, this variety is not dependent on or is less susceptible to temperature for fruiting. The 
mushrooms produced are small, and they rapidly break their veil for dissemination of the spores. All 
these properties, combined with the amphithallic life cycle, contribute to the adaptation of A. bisporus 
var. burnettii to rapidly completing its life cycle in an environment where the favorable period with 
enough humidity is short.
Recent evidence suggests that A. bisporus mushrooms also contain high levels of substances of 
possible medicinal importance such as tyrosinase, aromatase inhibitors, immunomodulating and anti-
tumor polysaccharides, ergosterol, vitamin D2, and various antioxidants (Beelman et al., 2003). All 
these components are interesting for the development of A. bisporus as a nutraceutical for the future 

80
Chapter 5  A. BISPORUS: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
(Gopalakrishnan et al., 2005; Lelley and Vetter, 2005). Genetic background is also expected to affect 
the quality and quantity of molecules with health-promoting activity in A. bisporus. Shao et al. (2010) 
measured higher concentrations of ergosterols and antioxidant activity in a brown cultivated strain 
than in a white hybrid. Savoie et al. (2008a) reported higher radical scavenging activity correlating 
with higher phenol content in methanol extracts of two native strains than in a white hybrid cultivated 
under the same conditions. But there has been no publication on variations in the potentials of health 
benefits with the genotypes of a large number of strains of A. bisporus. The only published work on a 
large number of strains was a comparison of agaritine contents in 50 A. bisporus strains from the native 
germplasm (Sabourin et al., 2008). Each of the American samples had lower mean agaritine levels than 
any of the European population samples, and cultivars had intermediate agaritine levels correspond-
ing to the lower-middle range recorded from European strains. The tetrasporic var. burnettii strains 
had significantly lower levels of agaritine than the cultivars. This work highlights a potentially useful 
resource available for developing A. bisporus strains with high or low contents of specific components.
The diversity of interest traits in native isolates and the knowledge of population features is a mine 
for mushroom breeders who pay attention to improving cultivation characteristics and post-harvest 
quality reaching consumer expectations and sustainable development.
5.4  GENETIC PROGRESS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWING OF  
AGARICUS BISPORUS
5.4.1  GENERATING VARIABILITY BY OUTCROSSING
Both availability and characterization of the genetic and phenotypic variability in a large germplasm on 
the one hand, and possibilities for outcrosses and recombination generating variability are required for 
genetic selection in breeding programs.
The main method for outcrossing is crosses between compatible homokaryons. In A. bisporus var. 
bisporus, the predominantly pseudohomothallic life, equivalent to a pseudoclonal inbreeding system, 
hampers outcrossing and limits breeding success since only a small proportion of the offspring is 
homokaryotic. Single spore isolates must be obtained, and 1 to 10% of homokaryotic ones are selected 
on phenotypic criteria such as mycelial growth rate and their inability to fructify. This is time con-
suming and results in high levels of error. Fortunately, the basic concept of marker-assisted selection 
(MAS), which refers to selection on the genotype of molecular marker(s) tightly linked to the trait 
rather than selection on the phenotype itself, has been developed and applied to homokaryotic spore 
isolation, giving a quick result with a high level of confidence (Kerrigan, 1992; Callac et al., 1997). On 
the other hand, the discovery of the heterothallic A. bisporus var. burnettii among the native genetic 
resources makes it possible to partly overcome the limitations due to selection of homokaryotic spores 
as the percentages of bi-, tri-, and tetrasporic basidia was estimated to be 1%, 14%, and 85%, respec-
tively (Callac et al., 1996) (Figure 5.3). The first generation of intervarietal hybrids (var. bisporus × var. 
burnettii) predominantly inherit the heterothallic life cycle of A. bisporus var. burnettii, giving rise to 
large recombined homokaryotic progenies useful for breeding works and genetic studies.
The second method of outcrossing in A. bisporus is a cross between a homokaryon and a heter-
okaryon via the Buller phenomenon (Buller, 1931). Callac et al. (2006) developed an easy way to get 
numerous hybrids in a single experiment by inoculating compost simultaneously with homokaryotic 

81
5.4  GENETIC PROGRESS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWING
mycelium from one parent and predominantly heterokaryotic spores from a second parent of A. bispo-
rus var. bisporus. Due to the intramictic process, these spores are not equivalent (Kerrigan, 1993). 
Taking into consideration the rearrangements by crossing over during the karyogamy and meiosis 
phases in basidia (Figure 5.3), the exchanged fragments are placed in a new genetic configuration 
because of interactions with the other loci of the chromatids. This leads to phenotypic variability, which 
could be used directly in breeding programs using single spore cultures to generate small changes in a 
variety (Moquet et al., 1998). The intramictic process might have been used to generate new cultivars 
from hybrids Horst® U1 and Horst® U3 exhibiting several phenotypic differences with the same genetic 
background (see II-1). The enhancement of variability by the “multispore culture” crossing method 
proposed by Callac et al. (2006) offers additional advantages. When positive traits such as resistance 
to a pathogen are linked to a locus bearing a lethal recessive allele, they cannot be exploited in breed-
ing programs using conventional crosses between homokaryons since the interesting homokaryon is 
not viable. Hybrids resulting from crosses between a homokaryon and heterokaryons via the Buller 
phenomenon can receive recessive deleterious alleles since there is no haploid step (no gametic/hap-
loid selection) for the material coming from the parent of the spores. In this way, alleles unavailable 
by conventional crossing are introduced. An example is given by Callac et al. (2008) with a strain for 
which only one of the parental nuclei can be isolated either from homokaryotic spores or by de-dikar-
yotization techniques. The hybrids which received recessive lethal alleles from the spores of this strain 
were on average less susceptible to the dry bubble disease caused by a fungal pathogen, Lecanicillium 
fungicola, than those that did not receive these alleles (Callac et al., 2008).
5.4.2  MODERN GENETICS APPLIED TO A. BISPORUS
Two haploid isolates of A. bisporus have recently been genome sequenced (Morin et al., 2012). Isolate 
H97 is from a cultivated European strain of A. bisporus var. bisporus which was a parent of the genuine 
hybrid Horst® U1, while isolate JB137-s8 is a native strain of A. bisporus var. tetrasporus isolated in 
the Sonoran Desert. The genome sequence offers a platform to develop genomic and transcriptomic 
analyses of A. bisporus for optimizations of the cultivation substrate utilization, improving the man-
agement of fruiting induction, for identifying and using genetic sources of resistance to pathogens, for 
improving shelf life, and for controlling metabolite biosynthesis. For instance, Eastwood et al. (2013) 
analyzed transcriptomic changes during the reproductive phase change and identified three gene clus-
ters with coordinated regulation of transcription in each. Two of them could represent a response to 
morphogenetic changes occurring during the reproductive phase change, and the third may form part 
of a genetic response to environmental signals which prepare the hyphae for fruiting. Temperature 
reduction, CO2, and 1-octen-3-ol all exert regulatory control on the initiation of fruiting body develop-
ment, but independently and at different points on the morphogenetic pathway and to different extents 
(Eastwood et al., 2013). The genes identified are functional targets for helping in the selection of strains 
with varying regulations by these factors. As another example, Bailey et al. (2013) studied the cap-
spotting symptoms that are produced when infection by the pathogen L. fungicola occurs late in the 
development of A. bisporus. They identified host-derived genes in a collection of suppression subtrac-
tive hybridizations, but only a few differential expressions were observed. Overall, the genes identified 
could be exploited as markers to assist in breeding programs. In sum, the genome provides for practical 
advances with an endless source of molecular markers useful for further genetic applications in the but-
ton mushroom (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2013).

82
Chapter 5  A. BISPORUS: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
Agaricus bisporus is entering the genomics era, with perspectives for integrative studies merging 
genomics, phenomics, and classical genetics. Genetic linkage mapping, which has been extensively 
used in plant or animal models, is more recent in fungal research and could become a major asset in the 
researcher’s toolbox (Foulongne-Oriol, 2012). A genetic linkage map is a representation of the genome 
that shows the relative position and genetic distances between markers or genes along chromosomes. 
A genetic distance is defined as a function of the crossover frequency during meiosis. The reference 
linkage of A. bisporus (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2010) was useful for assembling the genome, and it 
can now feed from the genome for developing new markers and fine mapping. Genetic linkage maps 
are useful for the localization of genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for economically 
important traits and then for marker-assisted selection in breeding (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2011a; 
Foulongne-Oriol, 2012). The genetics of yield-related traits and cap color have been investigated, mak-
ing it possible to refine our understanding of the inheritance of these traits (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 
2012a). The combination of phenotypic data along with genotypic data has permitted the genomic loca-
tion of either genes or QTLs for resistance to three pathogens (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2012b; Savoie 
et al., 2013). In addition to yield and pathogen resistance, two other traits are of concern for the promo-
tion of a sustainable agriculture and may benefit new prospects in the genetics of A. bisporus: aptitude 
to fruit at high temperature, and the composition of fruiting bodies in terms of health promoting actions 
and low safety risks. These are developed in the following paragraphs.
5.4.3  THE SELECTION OF STRAINS ABLE TO FRUIT AT HIGH TEMPERATURE
In Europe and America, the button mushroom has been grown in caves and cellars for two centuries. 
This was because of the climatic conditions favorable to the development of fruiting bodies, allow-
ing off-season cultivation: high relative humidity in the air and constant temperatures of 14–16°C. 
A temperature reduction from 25°C used during spawn running to 18°C induces the differentiation of 
primordia, which then develop further into fruiting bodies (Eastwood et al., 2013). With the objective 
of improving the management of fruiting body development and of both yield and quality, climatic 
chambers have replaced caves since the 1980s. Cleaning and prophylaxis are easier for controlling 
pests and pathogens, the work environment for the staffs is microbiologically secure, and the organiza-
tion of mushroom production is highly optimized. The synchronization of flushes may be improved by 
increasing the temperature to 21–25°C between flushes, and the fruiting temperature may be adapted 
to each commercial strain in the range of 16–19°C. However, this modern cultivation process neces-
sitates expensive facilities and it consumes large quantities of energy for climatic regulation, espe-
cially in hot countries and during hot seasons in temperate areas. Consequently, it is not suitable to 
sustainable small-scale farming. Therefore, identifying sources of thermo-tolerance, understanding the 
genetic background of the trait, and breeding thermo-tolerant strains are of practical significance for 
new opportunities for sustainable cultivation of A. bisporus.
Strains of A. bisporus tolerant to relatively high temperatures for both mycelial growth rate and 
fruiting ability have been identified in the germplasm of the species, either in China (Chen et al., 
2003) or in the European and North American mushroom populations (Largeteau et al., 2011). In 
these strains able to fruit at high temperature (FHT+), differentiation of primordia is not controlled by 
a decrease of temperature to 18°C and may occur at a constant temperature of 25°C. A few strains of 
A. bisporus var. producing high yields of mushrooms at 25°C have been selected (Navarro and Savoie, 
2015). Unfortunately, none of them combines all the traits the growers expect: rusticity, thermo-
tolerance, resistance to pathogens, high yield, high quality, and long shelf life. Therefore, breeding for 

83
5.4  GENETIC PROGRESS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWING
combining different agronomical traits in a single cultivar is a way to reach the objective of cultivation of  
A. bisporus at temperatures higher than 20°C in a context of sustainable agriculture together with the 
economic expansion of emerging countries. Understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie 
thermo-tolerance during fruiting is helping in breeding.
Genes potentially involved in thermo-tolerance have been identified. The first three thermo-
tolerance-related gene fragments were obtained using DD-RT-PCR to analyze gene expression in the 
vegetative mycelium of a thermo-tolerant Chinese strain under normal and higher-temperature cultiva-
tion (Chen et al., 2003). Later the full-length cDNA sequence of one gene (028-1 GenBank accession 
number DQ235473) was published, but no obvious homological sequence was found in the databases 
(Chen et al., 2005). Constructing a binary expression vector of 028-1 and transferring the gene in a non-
thermo-tolerant strain by Agrobacterium spp. mediated transformation; Chen et al. (2009) observed 
transformants able to growth at 34°C, whereas the native type did not grow at temperatures higher than 
30°C. However, the mycelial growth rate of both the thermo-tolerant parent and the transformants was 
strongly affected, with mycelial diameters after 22 days at 34°C being 15% to 25% of that at 28°C. The 
consequences for fruiting ability were not tested on these transformants. Navarro et al. (2013) studied 
028-1 in several FHT+ and FHT− strains and finally identified the encoded protein as an activating 
protein Yap1-like transcription factor participating in yeast thermo-tolerance. The protein was revealed 
as belonging to a new Agaricomycotina (Basidiomycota) subfamily of YAP1 homologs, and aap1 was 
proposed as a new name for 028-1. The authors analyzed the sequence polymorphism and alignment of 
the deduced polypeptide sequences in 24 strains of A. bisporus having different abilities for mycelial 
growth at temperatures above 30°C and for producing mature fruiting bodies at 25°C. No specific allele 
was observed for either the mycelium surviving at 33°C or the ability to fruit at 25°C (Navarro et al., 
2013). On the other hand, measuring the relative expression levels of aap1 in primordia or fruiting bod-
ies produced at 17°C and 25°C in nine FHT+ strains showed low levels of regulation and absence of 
a general pattern for the different strains. Aap1 is not a dominant contributor to the thermo-tolerance 
of A. bisporus, but the protein it encodes may be involved as an overall stress resistance transcription 
factor (Navarro et al., 2013).
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) constitute a large group of chaperone proteins found in virtually all 
organisms. They are a class of ubiquitous and highly conserved proteins which show increased expres-
sion in response to elevated temperature or other forms of environmental stress including increased con-
centrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interactions with pathogens. The hspA gene (Genbank 
X98508) was identified in A. bisporus thanks to differential expressions in primordia and fruiting bod-
ies of a commercial strain (Ospina-Giraldo et al., 2000). Regulation of hspA, a gene for a heat shock 
protein of the hsp70 family, was studied by qPCR in primordia and sporophores of 10 strains cultivated 
at 17°C or 25°C. Higher levels of expression were observed in the critical stages of primordia than 
in sporophores (unpublished data). The hspA gene might help prepare the primordia physiologically 
to rapidly progress in differentiation, leading to the production of mature sporophores, but the levels 
of expression in primordia produced at 25°C were lower than at 17°C, or not significantly different 
(unpublished data). On the other hand, measuring the time course of expression of heat shock proteins 
of A. bisporus, Lu et al. (2014) observed faster and more robust accumulation of these defense-related 
proteins in a thermo-tolerant strain than in a sensitive strain during high-temperature treatment of veg-
etative mycelium. Meanwhile, heat stress induced fast accumulation of H2O2 in the thermo-sensitive 
strain, but had a more moderate effect in the thermo-tolerant strain, where H2O2 accumulation might be 
limited by higher activities of catalase and superoxide dismutases (Lu et al., 2014). Para-amino-benzoic 
acid (PABA) has been identified as a component involved in the thermo-tolerance of the mycelium, 

84
Chapter 5  A. BISPORUS: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
by combining proteomic analysis, gene expression, quantification of the final product (PABA), and 
thermo-tolerance analysis after addition of PABA or inhibitors of its synthesis. PABA was shown to alle-
viate oxidative damage caused by heat stress, by increasing hsp genes and catalase and SOD activities 
(Lu et al., 2014). Finally, while mycelial thermo-tolerance involves general stress resistance processes, 
the ability to produce mature sporophores at 25°C is not likely linked to a stress response mechanism. 
This might explain why Foulongne-Oriol et al. (2014) did not observe significant differences in tran-
script profiling of A. bisporus var. burnettii primordia under two fruit-producing temperature conditions 
(17°C and 25°C) and why the numbers of fruiting bodies produced at both temperatures were correlated 
in an analysis of hybrids from an intervarietal A. bisporus var. bisporus × A. bisporus var. burnettii cross. 
A hypothesis for the mechanisms leading to the FHT+ trait is a lack of susceptibility to the temperature 
signal, which is necessary for induction of sporophores development in FHT− strains.
By phenotyping the progeny of the intervarietal A. bisporus var. bisporus × A. bisporus var. burnet-
tii hybrid previously used for building the reference linkage map of the species (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 
2010), the genetic inheritance of the FHT+ trait brought by the burnettii parental strain was demon-
strated (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2014). The phenotypic distribution of the number of fruiting bodies 
produced at both 17°C and 25°C and of the earliness of production showed continuous variation. The 
A. bisporus var. bisporus parent did not fructify at 25°C. Depending on the experiment, 65–87% of 
the hybrids from the offspring fructified at 25°C, but most of them were less productive than at 17°C 
and none reached the yield of the A. bisporus var. burnettii parent. A significant delay of first picking 
day was observed at 25°C, whereas the A. bisporus var. burnettii parent fructified earlier at 25°C than 
at 17°C. Broad-sense heritability analyses have suggested that most of the phenotypic variation was 
genetically determined (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2014).
Therefore, one can plan to breed strains of A. bisporus combining thermo-tolerance, high yields, and 
pathogen resistance (see Chapter 6) of the variety burnettii and other quality traits (firmness, low sus-
ceptibility to discoloration, color, etc.) found in strains of the variety bisporus. However, like the quality 
traits which might be affected under higher fruiting temperature conditions (Gao et al., 2013), FHT+ 
is a complex trait, with polygenic inheritance and sensitive to the environmental changes; thus, MAS 
based on QTLs might be useful for breeders. QTLs have been detected for FHT+ traits (Foulongne-
Oriol et al., 2014). Only two genomic regions, on two different linkage groups, are involved in deter-
mination of the ability to fructify at 25°C. Using the genome sequence, colocations between candidate 
genes and QTL related to FHT trait are possible. Two genes proved to be involved in thermo-tolerance 
in mycelium by Lu et al. (2014), an Hsp70 gene and Pabs gene encoding for PABA, are colocated with 
the most significant QTL of the FHT+ trait and might be used as markers for selection (Foulongne-
Oriol et al., 2014). MAS applied to either pyramiding or backcross breeding schemes is a promising 
strategy to develop original cultivars of A. bisporus.
The studies reported above illustrate how the use of modern genetics and the toolbox now available may 
contribute to generating markers and efficiently assisting breeding work for research groups or private com-
panies willing to develop A. bisporus strains attaining some of the requirements of sustainable agriculture.
5.4.4  SELECTION OF STRAINS WITH HEALTH-PROMOTING  
COMPOUNDS AND LOW SAFETY RISK
Among natural products, the use of mushrooms with therapeutic properties is growing day by day 
because they are readily obtained in relatively large quantities and are inexpensive. It is commonly 

85
5.4  GENETIC PROGRESS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWING
accepted by the scientific community that this resource remains largely underexploited in terms of 
molecules (metabolites, proteins, enzymes, polymers), the existence of which we may even not suspect. 
Some cultivated mushrooms are famous for their medicinal properties (L. edodes, Agaricus subrufes-
cens, Ganoderma lucidum, and other species), but A. bisporus also contains high levels of substances 
of possible medicinal importance (Beelman et al., 2003). In addition to the effects of cultivation condi-
tions and of mushroom maturation, one can expect to improve the mushrooms’ quality and their natural 
ability to produce selected health-promoting compounds by breeding programs, as for other traits.
Agaritine is a phenylhydrazine derivative naturally present in A. bisporus and other Agaricus spp. 
There is controversy about its status as a potential carcinogen, depending on the doses used in in vitro 
tests or in feeding tests (Roupas et al., 2010). Moreover, in contrast to the carcinogenic activity previ-
ously ascribed to this compound, Endo et al. (2010) reported antitumor activity against leukemic tumor 
cells in vitro for agaritine from A. suburefescens. Agaritine might be converted to a stronger carcino-
genic derivative when it is metabolized (Walton et al., 1997), which could explain its toxicity in certain 
experiments. Though a review of feeding studies using mushroom carpophores and mushroom extracts 
suggests that agaritine from consumption of cultivated A. bisporus mushrooms poses no known toxi-
cological risk to healthy humans (Roupas et al., 2010), it is a challenge for the mushroom industry to 
guarantee low levels of agaritine in mushrooms. The fact that the tetrasporic var. burnettii strains and 
some American native strains of A. bisporus var. bisporus had significantly lower levels of agaritine 
than the cultivars of A. bisporus var. bisporus (used in all the feeding tests) and some European native 
strains (Sabourin et al., 2008) opens up prospects for the development of improved intervarietal hybrids 
with low agaritine content. As for the FHT trait discussed above, phenotyping the progeny of the inter-
varietal A. bisporus var. bisporus × A. bisporus var. burnettii hybrid used for building the reference 
linkage map of the species would allow deciphering the genetic heritability of the agaritine content, and 
molecular markers would be identified for MAS application in breeding of low agaritine strains. This 
work still has to be done.
5.4.5  VALORIZATION OF GENETIC PROGRESS FOR SUSTAINABLE  
GROWING OF AGARICUS BISPORUS
A biological translation of the practical needs for developing sustainable growth of A. bisporus through-
out the world is the development of homogeneous, vigorous, and rustic strains able to produce under 
various conditions large quantities of fruiting bodies rich in active ingredients. The research performed 
on this mushroom clearly finds an available biodiversity within the species that is a source of interesting 
traits for the development of improved cultivars. The examples developed above show that intervari-
etal hybrids of A. bisporus var. burnettii × A. bisporus var. bisporus might be a primary source for the 
development of cultivars combining various traits in favor of sustainable methods of cultivation: high 
mycelial growth rates in compost, thermo-tolerance, ease of fruiting induction, high yields, resistance 
to pests and pathogens, richness in active ingredients, safety, but also firmness, low susceptibility to 
discoloration, and long shelf life.
Breeding usually requires considerable investment in time and resources, even taking advantage of 
the best of all the genome-based tools. This is a challenge now for mushroom breeders, but they might 
avoid the development of new varieties if they know it will be difficult to cover their investment due to 
a lack of protection of the new variety or strain. On another hand, growers and consumers are waiting 
for genetic progress allowing the development of sustainable mushroom production. Therefore, there is 

86
Chapter 5  A. BISPORUS: SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
a need for worldwide regulation for the protection of new mushroom varieties which both encourages 
breeders to develop new varieties expecting a return on investment and favors the global qualitative 
and quantitative improvement of mushroom production as one of the common public goods that should 
benefit the welfare of mankind.
The massive development of mycelium under sterile conditions is one of the main stages in the 
cultivation of edible fungi (Salmones et al., 2007). In the best case, it should be performed in well-
equipped laboratories with highly trained staff, which is a complex activity (Royse, 1997) and one of 
the main “bottleneck” processes for obtaining mushrooms with high commercial quality. The quality of 
the inoculum is related to the type of grain used, strain, and method and conditions of preparation (Mata 
and Savoie, 2007). Although the technology for spawn production has been properly established and 
considered a standard methodology, much of the information has been disseminated by the academic 
sector based on the experimental and control “hot spots” process, both from the point of biotechnol-
ogy as microbiologically through numerous scientific publications and outreach. In Western countries, 
specialized companies have developed and improved their own technologies without dissemination 
of information, and the links between mushroom cultivators and research centers have not been kept 
sufficiently robust as should be expected from a developing industry. In developing countries, some 
large mushroom growers have specialized laboratories to produce their own spawn, while others, usu-
ally small businesses or cooperatives, buy their spawn from private laboratories, but also from public 
research centers and universities (Salmones et al., 2007) working in the field of edible mushrooms.
5.5  CONCLUSIONS
Agaricus bisporus mushroom growth is an ancient activity which has developed in recent years with 
the introduction of more sophisticated cultivation techniques such as indoor composting, cultivation in 
climatic rooms, and use of hybrids. This progress leading to build large production facilities has mostly 
been motivated by market and economic constraints, but there still are several challenges in terms of 
environmental issues, management of fruiting induction, control of pests and pathogens, and food qual-
ity which growers and mushroom industry are faced with. In Western countries, there is a new demand 
for a re-localization of food production under environmentally friendly conditions, whereas the glo-
balization of food leads to a demand among consumers for the same products all over the world. The 
production of A. bisporus is an interesting way to respond to this demand and contribute to promoting 
sustainable production, both with the development of a small-scale mushroom farming and improve-
ment of the efficiency of production in large mushroom farms. They both will benefit from new under-
standing of biological processes now facilitated through the availability of modern biological tools and 
data as well as old and recent research results produced by universities and research institutes around 
the world. Current and future research thus concerns the improvement of agro-waste valorization dur-
ing A. bisporus cultivation and the use of natural biodiversity along with genetic knowledge.

6.1  INTRODUCTION
The mushroom industry is under pressure to comply with changing legislation regarding environ-
mental issues, human health, and food safety; it also faces economic constraints to reduce production 
costs. As other crops are, cultivated mushrooms are susceptible to a variety of pests and pathogens 
including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, which affect the yield and quality of mushroom harvested 
by growers. Few chemicals might be used to control mushroom pests and pathogens because of the 
susceptibility of the cultivated fungi to many molecules, the short duration of the cultivation cycles 
with risks of pesticide residues in harvested mushrooms, the decision that many molecules are going 
to be banned in Western countries, and resistance developed by pathogens to the commonly used 
pesticides. Consequently, mushroom growers have to change their practices for pest and pathogen 
suppression in their cultures. Four kinds of alternative actions might be used separately or in combi-
nation in integrated pest and pathogen management: (i) good hygiene practices; (ii) using mushroom 
varieties resistant to the main pests and pathogens; (iii) introducing biocontrol agents acting both 
directly as microbial antagonists and indirectly by stimulating the mushrooms’ defense mechanisms; 
and (iv) applying environmentally friendly biomolecules from agricultural wastes as substitutes for 
pesticides.
The most widely grown edible mushroom in many countries is the button mushroom Agaricus 
bisporus (J.E. Lange) Imbach. Because it is a humicolous fungus growing in the natural habitat in 
manures and leaf litters, its cultivation technique is quite different from that of most of the other culti-
vated species [Pleurotus spp., Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Pegler, Flammulina velutipes (Curtis) Singer, 
etc.], which are lignicolous fungi growing in the natural environment on dead wood. This chapter 
is focused on A. bisporus and presents an outline of past and recent developments in alternatives to  
pesticides for disease suppression during cultivation (Figure 6.1).

6.2  MAJOR PATHOGENS AFFECTING AGARICUS BISPORUS  
AND THEIR PROPHYLAXIS
The principal mushroom pests and pathogens known to significantly affect cultures of A. bisporus 
are fungal antagonists and fungal pathogens [Trichoderma aggressivum Samuels & W. Gam (green 
mold); Lecanicillium fungicola (Preuss) Zare & W. Gam (dry bubble); Mycogone perniciosa (Magnus) 
Delacr. (wet bubble); Hypomyces rosellus (Alb. & Schwein.) Tul. & C. Tul. (cobweb); Diehliomyces 
microsporus (Diehl & E.B. Lamb.) Gilkey (false truffle)], bacterial pathogens [Burkholderia gladi-
oli Severini (soft rot, cavity disease), Pseudomonas tolaasii Paine (bacterial blotch or brown blotch); 
Pseudomonas sp. (mummy disease)], viruses, insects (phorid and sciarid flies, cecidomyiid midges, 
mites), and nematodes (Fletcher and Gaze, 2008). Three pathogens are specifically presented in this 
chapter for discussion of new prospects in pathogen control in button mushroom cultures: (i) green 
mold as the representative of competitors or antagonists of the vegetative mycelium in compost, (ii) 
dry bubble as a significant disease caused by a fungus affecting the development of fruiting bodies 
after interaction on the casing layer during the early stage of differentiation, and (iii) brown blotch as a 
disease caused by bacteria altering the fruiting bodies.
6.2.1  ANTAGONISTS OF A. BISPORUS: WEED MOLDS AND TRICHODERMA SPP.
Fungi which act as competitors or antagonists of the vegetative mycelium of A. bisporus are frequently 
responsible for crop loss. These weed molds generally develop in bad-quality composts. One can often

find small patches of the lipstick mold (Sporendonema purpurescens) at the surface of the casing layer. 
The white and brown plaster molds (Scopulariopsis fimicola and Papulaspora byssina) are present in 
wet composts which remain sticky and dark colored in infected areas. Later, the surface of the casing 
may be densely covered with spores looking like flour or plaster. When high ammonia content persists 
in compost, Chaetomium spp. (C. olivaceum, C. globosum) might colonize it as the olive green mold. 
Green molds were caused by Trichoderma species and had no serious consequences, except during 
the summer months in Western countries, until a new pathogen appeared in cultures in Ireland in the 
spring of 1985 and spread across Europe in the following years. In parallel, the new green mold disease 
was recorded in North America 10 years later. The causal agent is T. aggressivum, with a European 
biotype (T. aggressivum f. europaeum, formerly Th2; Figure 6.2) and an American biotype (T. aggres-
sivum f. aggressivum, formerly Th4). The ability of these biotypes to grow in compost and outcompete  
A. bisporus depends on several genetic characteristics. Trichoderma aggressivum can flourish in com-
post inoculated or uninoculated with A. bisporus, while less aggressive species only poorly colonize 
these substrates. Metabolites produced by A. bisporus and stimulating the growth of T. aggressivum,

but inhibiting other Trichoderma spp., contribute to the aggressiveness (Mumpuni et al., 1998). On the 
other hand, T. aggressivum does not present a better ability to degrade compost components than the 
other species, but it exhibits a higher tolerance toward the inhibitory effect of bacteria and fungi pre-
sent in compost (Mamoun et al., 2000a; Savoie et al., 2001). During direct interaction, T. aggressivum 
produces a coumarin that limits the growth of A. bisporus (Krupke et al., 2003). Specific isoforms of 
chitinases (Guthrie and Castle, 2006) and a β-glucanase are induced as a part of its aggression capacity 
(Abubaker et al., 2013).
Management of the composting process using indoor composting, or at least a carefully performed 
pasteurization phase with filtered air, is recommended for producing high-quality composts cleaned of 
most of the spores of the weed molds. During the cultures, the spread of spores from the infected area 
to others can be limited by good hygiene and adequate organization of the cultivation areas and circula-
tion of workers. Red pepper mites are often associated with the presence of Trichoderma spp. and may 
contribute to the spread of the spores. Benzimidazole fungicides have been used in America as a pre-
ventive treatment for mushroom spawn, but benzimidazole resistance has appeared in T. aggressivum 
(Romaine et al., 2005) and it is not authorized in Europe. There is no specific fungicide treatment for 
controlling weed molds, though several molecules have been tested (Kredics et al., 2010).
6.2.2  DRY BUBBLE DISEASE
A profile of Lecanicillium fungicola, the fungal agent of dry bubble diseases, has been published by 
Berendsen et al. (2010). When L. fungicola spores germinate on developing fruiting bodies, superficial 
cinnamon-brown lesions are formed (spotty cap). When the sporophores initially are attacked before 
the mushroom tissues are differentiated into stipes and caps, the mycoparasites affect the morphogen-
esis of A. bisporus fruiting bodies, leading to the production of deformed tissue with no sign of dif-
ferentiation, the dry bubbles (Figure 6.3). Lecanicillium fungicola infects fruiting mycelia but rarely 
attacks vegetative ones. This might be due to identification of the host via lectins on the surface of 
hyphae that are developmentally regulated (Bernado et al., 2004). A lectin was actually shown to be 
downregulated during infection of A. bisporus sporocarps by L. fungicola. In this way, the mushroom 
might alter its mycelial surface composition and therefore interfere with recognition by the pathogen, 
limiting the infection (Bailey et al., 2013). 1-Octen-3-ol is a volatile compound produced by A. bispo-
rus; it has been implicated in the self-inhibition of fruiting body formation, while it has been shown to 
inhibit spore germination of L. fungicola. The decrease of 1-octen-3-ol concomitant with the induction 
of fruiting might also be favorable to the germination of L. fungicola and consequently infection at the 
susceptible stage (Berendsen et al., 2013a). After attachment, the mycoparasite penetrates the host cell 
walls and modifies the genetic program of differentiation into fruiting bodies.
By studying the expression of three selected genes, Largeteau et al. (2010) observed levels in dry 
bubbles similar to the first developmental stage of non-infected cultures. This illustrates morpho-
genesis disruption occurring after infection. Unfortunately, there is no published work on an overall 
survey of differentially expressed genes in healthy and affected pins. In a transcriptomic analysis 
of the interactions between A. bisporus and L. fungicola forming spotty caps, it was impossible to 
determine whether the differential expression observed was a function of the host defense pathways, 
or whether it was a result of L. fungicola interfering with normal developmental processes (Bailey 
et al., 2013).

97
6.2  MAJOR PATHOGENS AFFECTING AGARICUS BISPORUS
The necrotic lesions on the cap surface (spotty cap symptom) may reflect a response of A. bisporus  
similar to the hypersensitive response in plants where cells in contact with the pathogen die and encap-
sulate it in a necrotic tissue. In the bubbles, the browning was shown actually not to be an efficient 
mechanism of defense but a tissue alteration resulting from high levels of infection by L. fungicola 
(Largeteau et al., 2007). The oxidative stress reaction may occur during the host-pathogen interaction 
with involvement of hydrogen peroxide. A negative correlation was found between the susceptibility 
of A. bisporus strains to dry bubble disease and hydrogen peroxide levels in infected tissues of these 
strains, but not in healthy sporocarps (Savoie and Largeteau, 2004). A gene encoding for a heat shock 
protein of the HSP70 family in A. bisporus involved in oxidative stress reaction (hspA) was shown to 
be overexpressed in primordia of strains partially resistant to L. fungicola when compared to suscepti-
ble strains (Largeteau et al., 2010). This may help A. bisporus to protect itself against the high level of 
reactive oxygen species which it produces to counterattack L. fungicola.
Currently, control of L. fungicola relies mainly on prevention and hygiene measures in mushroom 
farms during picking, on control of mites and flies disseminating spores, and on efficient removal

of finished crops. Fungicides may be sprayed on the developing crop if the pathogen appears, but 
active control is difficult because the chemicals used have become less effective as the pathogen has 
developed resistance, and legislation is restricting their use. In Europe, chlorothalonil and prochloraz 
manganese are recommended and authorized, while carbendazim is inefficient because of L. fungicola 
resistance (Anonymous, 2000).
6.2.3  THE BACTERIAL BROWN BLOTCH PATHOGENS
Pseudomonas is the major spoilage genus associated with blotch in fresh mushrooms. A number of 
diverse species have the ability to cause blotch diseases with various degrees of discolorations and 
have a certain role in the expression of such symptoms. Pseudomonas tolaasii is the main causative 
agent of the classical bacterial blotch disease in cultivated mushrooms (Figure 6.4). It induces dark-
brown, often wet and sunken lesions on button mushroom caps and stalks, which render the crop 
unmarketable.
The mechanism of A. bisporus infection by P. tolaasii is well documented (Largeteau and Savoie, 
2010). Briefly, the pathogenic type of bacteria produces the extracellular toxin tolaasin, composed of 
seven lipodepsipeptides. The effect of tolaasin on mushroom caps is attributed to its capacity to disrupt 
the plasma and vacuole membrane in A. bisporus cells by its surfactant properties and its ion channel 
forming activity. As a consequence, the phenol oxidases (tyrosinases) in the mushroom cells are in 
contact with phenolic compounds released from vacuoles, and these substrates are transformed into 
dark pigmented melanin by the enzymes. Mamoun et al. (1999) proposed a model in which the inten-
sity of the symptoms is dependent on the GHB-melanin biosynthesis pathway and the concentration in 
γ-l(+)-glutamyl-4-hydroxybenzene (GHB). By studying other strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens 
Migula group, Henkels et al. (2014) suggested that certain antifungal metabolites, long associated with 
FIGURE 6.4

6.3  STRAINS OF AGARICUS BISPORUS RESISTANT TO PATHOGENS
the biocontrol capabilities of these bacteria against fungal plant pathogens, can be toxic to A. bisporus, 
manifesting as discoloration or pitting of mushroom caps.
Bacterial blotch is strongly influenced by environmental and surface-moisture conditions. Once the 
disease occurs, blotch-causing bacteria are spread by splash-dispersal during watering. Consequently, 
pathogen control requires inhibiting its reproduction on the mushroom surface and further dissemina-
tion. Temperature and relative humidity should be controlled to ensure that water droplets or moisture 
films on mushrooms dry up within 2–3 h. Good ventilation should be ensured after watering. Sodium 
hypochlorite at 150 ppm chlorine, applied every time the casing is watered, helps to keep the incidence 
down (Anonymous, 2000). Alternatively, an acetic acid solution at 70–80 mM might be used as it has 
proved to be efficient in Pleurotus eryngii (DC.) Quél. cultures (Bruno et al., 2014).
6.3  STRAINS OF AGARICUS BISPORUS RESISTANT TO PATHOGENS
6.3.1  GENETIC RESOURCES FOR RESISTANCE TO MUSHROOM PATHOGENS
Local varieties and native relatives of a cultivated mushroom might be a source of biodiversity likely 
to contain high levels of genetic diversity with potential resistance or low susceptibility to pathogens. 
Unfortunately, many studies show a narrow genetic variability among the cultivars of A. bisporus 
(Savoie et al., 2013), but hundreds of native specimens are currently preserved in the germplasm of  
A. bisporus in the collection of the Agaricus Resource Program (ARP) or Collection of Germplasm 
of Agaricus at Bordeaux (INRA-CGAB), as well as various laboratory collections. Attempts to find  
A. bisporus strains resistant to various pathogens have been undertaken to different extents depending 
on the pathogen, but not all the germplasm potential has been investigated yet.
6.3.1.1  Resistance to Trichoderma aggressivum
To test the susceptibility of A. bisporus strains to green mold, the best method is based on crop loss anal-
ysis in experimental facilities, in trials where calibrated spore suspensions of T. aggressivum have been 
either mixed with the spawn just before compost spawning, or inoculated at the surface of the compost 
just after spawning. Using this method, commercially available A. bisporus strains have exhibited dif-
ferent susceptibility to T. aggressivum f. aggressivum (Anderson et al., 2001). Hybrid white strains were 
extremely susceptible, while hybrid off white strains exhibited intermediate susceptibility and brown 
strains were less susceptible. However, using 25 native strains ranging from cream to dark brown color, 
and 12 commercial strains, Mamoun et al. (2000b) did not observe significant relationships between cap 
color and susceptibility to T. aggressivum f. europaeum.
Alternative methods have been searched for in the laboratory for screening the mushroom germ-
plasm for pathogen resistance. Chen et al. (2003) proposed to measure the ability of the strains to 
protect the spawn substrate from colonization by the pathogen, though this grain test does not offer 
the level of resolution afforded by a crop loss assessment. An in vitro test using agar media containing 
cell wall lytic enzymes and undefined metabolites of Trichoderma from a commercial product (Lysing 
Enzyme®) was used to establish whether improvement of mushroom resistance to T. aggressivum could 
be obtained by inducing reaction mechanisms before contact with the pathogen and whether this abil-
ity was strain dependent (Savoie and Mata, 2003). A large variability in response to the treatment was 
observed, and this method was further used in laboratory screening of germplasms on this component 

100
Chapter 6  NEW PROSPECTS IN PATHOGEN CONTROL
of resistance (Savoie et al., 2008). Recent results have indicated that laccase activity, in particular that 
encoded by lcc 2, serves as a defense response of A. bisporus to T. aggressivum toxins and contributes 
to green mold resistance in commercial brown strains (Sjaarda et al., 2015).
Using the different methods, a few strains have appeared slightly susceptible and could be used in 
breeding programs, but absolute resistance was not observed.
6.3.1.2  Resistance to Lecanicillium fungicola
For testing the resistance to a pathogen, management of the contamination by the pathogen is neces-
sary. With L. fungicola, it is easy to evaluate the resistance of an A. bisporus strain to the development 
of spotty caps by placing droplets containing spore suspensions of the pathogen on fruiting bodies. 
However, this gives no information on the susceptibility to the production of dry bubbles. Inoculation 
of the casing surface before the development of the fruiting bodies is more representative of the natural 
contamination leading to dry bubbles. Both the yield of healthy mushrooms and the percentage of dis-
eased mushrooms can be measured as criteria for dry bubble susceptibility. However, the date of inocula-
tion is an important parameter. In a casing inoculation experiment, a significant correlation between the 
time needed by A. bisporus strains to form their first fruiting bodies and susceptibility to L. fungicola 
was observed (Largeteau et al., 2004). The earlier fruiting strains were significantly less diseased.
Using such tests, wild A. bisporus strains highly tolerant to L. fungicola were identified in the 
INRA-CGAB collection after testing 450 strains (Savoie et al., 2013). In this work, as in others, total 
resistance was not found (Berendsen et al., 2010; Largeteau and Savoie, 2010), showing that resistance 
is a multifactorial trait. However, interesting strains have been identified as candidate for introgression 
of their partial resistance into other strains in breeding programs.
6.3.1.3  Resistance to Pseudomonas tolaasii
A standardized method to assess mushroom blotch resistance in cultivated and native A. bisporus strains 
has been developed and used on a wide range of strains. Immediately after harvesting, mushrooms are 
arranged in moist chambers. Then 20-µL droplets of bacterial suspension are placed at the top of the 
caps and symptoms are evaluated after incubation for 48 h at 16°C. Alternatively, a toxin (tolaasin) 
suspension may be used. Three commercial strains and 26 native strains were tested by Moquet et al. 
(1996). A great diversity of symptom intensity was observed. The susceptibility of white and brown 
strains was different, and due to a strong genetic linkage with the color allele PPC1, two different mod-
els for the susceptibility had to be taken into account, depending on the type of strain (Mamoun et al., 
1999; Moquet et al., 1999).
As with the two other pathogens, no absolute resistance was found. In addition, there is no cor-
relation between the susceptibility of different A. bisporus strains to P. tolaasii, to L. fungicola, and to  
T. aggressivum (Largeteau et al., 2004), showing that different biological mechanisms are involved.
6.3.2  BREEDING FOR RESISTANCE TO PATHOGENS
As with other economically important production traits such as yield and quality, resistance to patho-
gens of edible mushroom cultures is under polygenic inheritance. This was suggested by the absence of 
true resistance in the germplasm of A. bisporus and had been clearly stated for resistance to L. fungicola 
(Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2011a). Partial resistances identified in native strains have yet to be introduced 
into suitable commercial varieties of mushroom. Selecting for such quantitative traits is possible, but 

101
6.3  STRAINS OF AGARICUS BISPORUS RESISTANT TO PATHOGENS
not easy and could take a long time due to the difficulties in selective breeding of A. bisporus. This spe-
cies has a complex life cycle involving dikaryotic cells, infrequent meiotic recombination, and usually 
the production of dikaryotic basidiospores which effectively are already mated and can produce new 
fruiting bodies without crossing (Savoie et al., 2013).
That is why great attention was paid on the development of molecular tools allowing the dissection 
of these quantitative traits in individualized loci through quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. These 
approaches may greatly facilitate the effective manipulation of levels of resistance to pathogens in 
subsequent breeding programs. They have been extensively proven to be successful in plant and animal 
breeding, and the use of molecular markers in mushroom varietal selection is now on the rails with 
studies developed with A. bisporus as a model (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2012a,b).
The construction of a genetic linkage map was the first step toward understanding the genetic basis 
of resistance to pathogens. This was achieved with the construction of the first comprehensive linkage 
map for A. bisporus obtained in intervarietal hybrids between A. bisporus var. bisporus and A. bisporus 
var. burnettii (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2010). In parallel, numerous traits of interest were assessed on the 
intervarietal derived materials, and a phenotypic database was established. The combination of pheno-
typic data along with genotypic data permitted the genomic location of either genes or QTLs for resist-
ance to the three pathogens explored in this chapter (Savoie et al., 2013). A majority of the QTLs was 
found specific to one pathogen, suggesting that distinct mechanisms are involved, in agreement with the 
absence of strain combining resistances to the three pathogens in the explored germplasm.
QTL analysis may help to understand the biological bases of the pathogen actions. A QTL on the 
ability to resist or adapt to Trichoderma metabolites was found in the vicinity of a QTL related to myce-
lium growth in controlled condition (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 2011b), in agreement with the role of the 
fitness of A. bisporus strains for colonizing the compost before strong development of T. aggressivum. 
A QTL controlling the dry bubble symptom caused by L. fungicola mapped in the same genomic inter-
val as the fruiting earliness trait and may be related to fitness, in agreement with previous observations 
on susceptibility of the native strains (Largeteau et al., 2004) presented in Section 2.1.2. A major QTL 
for resistance to P. tolaasii explained about 30% of phenotypic variation, and was closely linked to the 
cap color locus PPC1 (Moquet et al., 1999). Interestingly, this region was also found to be involved in 
resistance against L. fungicola during secondary infection leading to spotty caps (Foulongne-Oriol et al., 
2012b; Savoie et al., 2013). The resistance alleles to the both symptoms were associated with the brown 
allele at PPC1, suggesting a shared mechanism of resistance based on melanin biosynthesis.
QTL analysis also allows the highlighting of the difficulties and limitations of mushroom breed-
ing for resistance to pathogen. The hybrids most resistant to L. fungicola tend to early production of 
numerous small mushrooms that could not be expected by mushroom growers searching for large 
mushrooms. This is in agreement with QTL collocations, but such unfavorable linkage drags highlight 
the difficulty for introgressing desirable pathogen resistance traits from native strains in commercial 
hybrids maintaining expected yield and quality levels (Savoie et al., 2013). On the other hand, a com-
mon genomic region was involved in both spotted cap symptom caused by L. fungicola and adaptation 
to Trichoderma metabolites, but the parental origin was different for each trait. Combining multiple 
pathogen resistances in one genotype will necessitate multi-path breeding schemes.
The whole genome of A. bisporus has been publicly available since 2011 (http://genome.jgi.doe 
.gov/Agabi_varbisH97_2/Agabi_varbisH97_2.home.html), and this is going to contribute hugely to our 
understanding of interactions with its pathogens and to development of resistant strains. The tight rela-
tionship between the linkage map and genome sequence also makes possible custom-made molecular

markers tightly linked to target loci for further marker-assisted selection (MAS). MAS is a promising 
tool that is already used in A. bisporus breeding for genetically simple traits and is going to be used for 
pathogen resistance, based on the studies of QTLs presented above. In combination with the genetic 
resources available, the whole genome sequence and the new generation sequencing technologies offer 
the opportunity to perform genome-wide association studies to identify pathogen resistance traits.
6.4  BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS
Biological control is the practice or process by which an undesirable organism is controlled by means 
of another (beneficial) organism. Biological control agents (BCAs) act by direct and sometimes indi-
rect effects of microbial antagonism: parasitism, antibiosis, or competition. There are a number of 
BCAs commercially available for use in plant protection. As is done for fungicides, one can imagine 
testing their efficiency for the protection of mushroom cultures. Another way of developing biocontrol 
of mushroom pathogens is to identify new BCAs and define their optimal use by using knowledge on 
the biology of the host–pathogen interactions.
6.4.1  BIOCONTROL OF TRICHODERMA AGGRESSIVUM WITH BACTERIA
A relevant illustration of the extensive use of a BCA is given by the biofungicide Serenade®, tested and 
registered as a biocontrol agent of T. aggressivum in Europe since 2007. On the one hand, Savoie et al. 
(2001) observed that Bacillus species had inhibitory effects on T. aggressivum growth in compost, and 
on the other hand, Krupke et al. (2003) suggested that lactonase-producing bacteria should be involved 
in disease prevention by degrading methyl-isocoumarins produced by T. aggressivum as an antifungal 
compound active on A. bisporus. Based on these publications, several groups have tried to isolate lac-
tonase-producing bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis from mushroom cultures and tested their efficiency 
as BCAs toward T. aggressivum. Another method was followed at the French Mushroom Technical 
Center. Védie and Rousseau (2008) examined commercial formulae of registered BCAs and found 
Serenade® based on B. subtilis QST 713 an efficient biocontrol product for protecting A. bisporus when 
mixed with the spawn just before inoculation into the compost. This strain was already registered as a 
biopesticide and it was easy to obtain a registration for its use in mushroom cultures. It is supposed to 
work in three different ways to fight disease-causing pathogens: it stops harmful spores from germi-
nating, it disrupts cell membrane growth, and it inhibits attachment of the pathogen to its host. Up to 
now, the role of lactonase in its efficiency against green mold disease has not been proved. As a fungus, 
A. bisporus might also be affected by B. subtilis QST 713. It is thus obvious that indirect mushroom-
mediated mechanisms also play a role in disease suppression. In the case of another mushroom species, 
Pleurotus ostreatus, it was shown that Paenobacillus polymyxa and other bacterial isolates inhibiting 
Trichoderma spp. in substrate did not stop the growth of the cultivated fungus, but partially affected 
mycelium growth and stimulated a defense reaction in which induction of higher levels of laccase 
activities occurred (Velázquez-Cedeño et al., 2008). Similarly, B. subtilis QST 713 could stimulate the 
defenses of A. bisporus in which laccase activity contributes to resistance and is a likely candidate for 
the enzymatic breakdown of methyl-isocoumarin produced by T. aggressivum (Sjaarda et al., 2015). 
This BCA is currently used by mushroom growers in France, but when tested under different cultiva-
tion conditions, the efficiency of Serenade® has not always been confirmed (Kosanovic´ et al., 2013). 

103
6.4  Biological Control Agents
Research into defining these bioprotective mechanisms and for selecting BCAs adapted to the compost 
microbiota is needed. There have been some results registered leading to patents. That is the case for 
the use of a strain belonging to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Bolkan and Larsen, 1998) and of another 
strain of B. subtilis (Gheshlaghi and Verdellen, 2009). However, to our knowledge, the development of 
commercial products used by growers is not documented.
6.4.2  BIOCONTROL OF PSEUDOMONAS TOLAASII WITH PHAGES AND 
ANTAGONISTIC BACTERIA
Various viruses affect A. bisporus, and some of these may cause diseases, but this issue is not discussed 
here [see Largeteau and Savoie (2010) for a review]. We paid attention to bacteriophages, which are 
bacterial viruses that invade bacterial cells, being ubiquitous in the environment. They play a key role 
in controlling bacterial numbers in various habitats and are involved in gene transfer between bacteria. 
There are many advantages to the use of bacteriophages. They have a high specificity to certain host 
bacteria, avoiding their detrimental effect on other Pseudomonas species in the casing layer that can be 
involved in fruiting induction, and they have a rapid sterilization effect on their hosts.
The first report on the isolation of bacteriophages from fruiting bodies of A. bisporus and their 
potential for practical use as BCAs in the mushroom industry was published by Munsch and Olivier 
(1995). The phage TO.1 was selected by these scientists. The best application time of phage suspen-
sion as a spray on the casing layer was at the beginning of the bacterial multiplication, i.e., 4 days after 
casing. Over 10 years of experiments with artificial inoculation of the same strain of P. tolaasii, the 
efficiency of bioprotection with TO.1 varied from 30% to 80%, depending on uncontrolled variations 
of cultivation conditions. In another experiment, it was shown that the efficiency of using this phage 
was dependent on the bacterial strain and there was a risk of selection regarding preexisting resistant 
strains in mushroom farms. To our knowledge, this bacteriophage has not been commercialized and 
used in mushroom farms, but the concept of bacteriophage use still is a good strategy to decrease the 
level of bacterial blotch disease in mushroom cultures. Recently, bacteriophages isolated from various 
sewage samples were shown to have lysing activities in P. tolaasii and to efficiently protect P. ostreatus 
against bacterial blotch (Kim et al., 2011). The sequence of the whole genome of the phage φPto-bp6g 
was then characterized and proposed to be potentially applicable as a safe biological control reagent 
against brown blotch disease in mushroom cultivation (Nguyen et al., 2012). Sajben-Nagy et al. (2012) 
isolated phages from necrotic caps of P. ostreatus and characterized one of them.
The search for antagonistic bacteria has received more attention than the bacteriophage method. It 
was initiated in the 1970s with the use of nonpathogenic P. tolaasii, but control levels were low and 
inconsistent (Nair and Fahy, 1972, 1976; Olivier et al., 1978). After an intensive isolation and screen-
ing program for bacteria antagonistic to P. tolaasii, Fermor et al. (1991) developed a biocontrol system 
for bacterial blotch in which the antagonist was applied on the mushroom bed in three treatments dur-
ing the culture: at casing, pre-pinning, and after first flush. A consistent reduction in bacterial blotch 
disease levels in mushroom crops, of at least 50%, was achieved in assays with selected antagonists. 
Recently, antagonist strains have been isolated from compost, soil cover, and button caps with or with-
out visible symptoms. A strain of Pseudomonas putida was selected as a potential BCA (Tajalipour 
et al., 2014). A patent has been registered on an active biocontrol agent (Pseitdonionas synxantha 
PS54) against Pseudomonas species causing rotting diseases in mushroom production (Manczinger 
et al., 2013). This followed an older one on an isolated strain of P. fluorescens (Fahy, 1987). Overall 

104
Chapter 6  NEW PROSPECTS IN PATHOGEN CONTROL
results of the different studies suggest that bacterial antagonists may be potential biocontrol agents for 
biological promotion of the health and growth of button mushroom, but their real use in mushroom 
farms still needs to be developed.
6.4.3  NO BIOCONTROL OF LECANICILLIUM FUNGICOLA
In the specific case of fungal pathogens of cultivated mushrooms, both the host and the pathogen are 
fungi, making it necessary to test the effect of the biocontrols on the host. Due to the biology of the 
host-pathogen interaction, the selection of possible biocontrol agents for dry bubble disease should 
focus on microorganisms that occur naturally in the casing soil in high densities, and preferably associ-
ated with A. bisporus (Berendsen et al., 2012). There have been attempts to identify BCAs effective 
against L. fungicola reported in the 1970s (de Trogoff and Ricard, 1976) and since 2000 (Bhatt and 
Singh, 2000; Bhat et al., 2010), but as for the other pathogens presented above, there is no publication 
on follow-up.
In a recent work, 160 bacterial strains were isolated from colonized casing and screened for in vitro 
antagonism to L. fungicola (Berendsen et al., 2012). It appeared in vitro that L. fungicola was sensi-
tive to siderophore-mediated competition for iron and to antibiosis. Consequently, it was affected by 
many fluorescent pseudomonads. However, the more promising bacteria did not control the pathogen 
in bioassays simulating the commercial culture conditions. The authors attributed this ineffectiveness 
to characteristics of both L. fungicola and A. bisporus. The survival of the inoculum and the rate of bac-
teria necessary for biocontrol activity are also questioned. On the other hand, Berendsen et al. (2013b) 
observed that the white button mushroom did not develop an induced resistance to L. fungicola after a 
first infection. The conclusion of these investigations is that biological control of the dry bubble patho-
gen with antagonistic bacteria will be very difficult. Future efforts to control the dry bubble pathogen 
should therefore focus on other methods such as the development of resistant A. bisporus strains or the 
use of environmentally friendly biomolecules.
6.5  USE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BIOMOLECULES
Environmentally friendly biomolecules from specific plants and agricultural wastes might be used as 
substitutes for pesticides for mushroom pathogens control.
6.5.1  ESSENTIAL OILS
Since antiquity, essential oils have been widely used for bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, and insec-
ticidal applications. Most of them are extracted by distillation from aromatic plants, and they contain 
a variety of volatile and nonvolatile molecules. Depending on type and concentration, they exhibit 
cytotoxic effects on living cells but are usually non-genotoxic. Many of these natural compounds have 
been tested as alternative agents against pathogens of edible fungi, and their strong fungistatic effect 
has been demonstrated. For instance, Sokovic´ and Van Griensven (2006) tested in vitro effects of essen-
tial oils extracted from various plant species on the pathogens causing the three major diseases of  
A. bisporus. The essential oils from Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris, and Mentha spicata showed 
the best in vitro effects. Other studies were focused on the fungal pathogens affecting the fruiting 

105
6.5  Use of Environmentally Friendly Biomolecules
bodies (Tanovic et al., 2009) or on green mold (Gorski et al., 2010). All the authors observed strong  
in vitro effects after using certain essential oils.
In vitro activity is a condition that is insufficient for identifying a biopesticide. Tests must be done 
under growing conditions. In a study on wet bubble disease, only a limited number of essential oils from 
a wide range of available oils screened were found to have the ability to effectively inhibit the pathogen 
M. perniciosa while exhibiting a minimal effect on the growth of A. bisporus (Regnier and Combrinck, 
2010). In a preventive application of thyme and lemon verbena essential oils to casings inoculated with 
the pathogen, healthy mushrooms with no visible signs of M. perniciosa infection were harvested, 
whereas a curative use of these essential oils was ineffective in controlling the occurrence of the wet 
bubble pathogen on the mushrooms and severe infections (Regnier and Combrinck, 2010). Tea tree oil 
did not exhibit significant antifungal activity on Trichoderma isolates collected on A. bisporus from 
Serbian farms (Kosanovic´ et al., 2013). Finally, essential oil vapors might serve to control proliferation 
of mold and bacteria in mushroom growing chambers that are now treated with other sanitizing agents, 
but more studies are required to develop specific methods for practical application of commercial  
products, which should have a cost acceptable to the mushroom growers.
6.5.2  COMPOST TEA
Apart from essential oils, the application of a variety of water-based extracts from composts made of 
agricultural wastes was tested for suppressing plant pathogens. Interesting studies on the use of spent 
mushroom substrate (SMS) tea were performed by Gea et al. (2014). SMS tea was obtained after steam 
treatment of SMS, including casings composed mainly of peat moss, at 70°C for 12 h, followed by 
recomposting (or maturation) for 57 days, and mixing this treated SMS with water for 1 day under aero-
bic conditions. SMS teas provided in vitro inhibition of mycelial growth of L. fungicola. In mushroom 
crops inoculated with L. fungicola, the application of SMS teas decreased the incidence of dry bubble 
disease. These results and the absence of any fungitoxic effect on A. bisporus suggest that the dry bub-
ble pathogen can be controlled by the use of teas made from SMS (Gea et al., 2014). When SMS tea 
was added to the casing layer, its microbial community might have affected the final composition of the 
casing layer microbiome, which was less favorable to the development of L. fungicola. SMS tea may be 
considered a biological alternative to fungicides for the integrated control of L. fungicola because it has 
high efficiency against the pathogen without significant detrimental effects on the yield of mushroom, 
and without the risk of fungicide residues in mushrooms (Navarro et al., 2011). This is an easy method 
of biocontrol using a homemade product to be included in integrated pest management strategies. For 
large development of this biocontrol method, variations in microbial and chemical characteristics of the 
SMS teas must be managed by a standardized method of production for a guarantee of efficacy.
6.5.3  WHITE LINE-INDUCING PRINCIPLE
Bioactive compounds extracted from BCA and various microorganisms from soils and plants have been 
examined and promoted as replacements for synthetic pesticides to suppress diseases in plant cultures. 
For mushrooms, this method of biocontrol has not been developed. This might be due to the fact that 
for fungal diseases, both the host and the pathogen are fungi. In the case of bacterial blotch, a cell-free 
crude extract of Pseudomonas reactans containing a lipodepsipeptide was proposed as a bioactive  
compound to be used as a preventive treatment to protect A. bisporus against P. tolaasii (Soler-Rivas 

106
Chapter 6  NEW PROSPECTS IN PATHOGEN CONTROL
et al., 1999). This compound, named the white line-inducing principle (WLIP), is a component of 
P. reactans virulence. As tolaasin does, WLIP is able to damage mushroom membranes by forming 
transmembrane pores, but it doesn’t pass through the entire membrane because of its molecular size. 
It may have a detergent-like activity (Coraiola et al., 2006) with limited damage to the mushrooms.
WLIP was previously used in the identification of pathogenic forms of P. tolaasii due to the white 
precipitate formed by a complex between WLIP and tolaasin (Figure 6.5). Such a complex might neu-
tralize the toxin on pretreated mushrooms, which would explain the reduction of symptoms of brown 
blotch disease. Both crude extracts and purified WLIP had inhibitory effects on brown discoloration 
induced by inoculation of P. tolaasii on mushroom caps (Soler-Rivas et al., 1999), but to our knowledge, 
no commercial product has been developed to date.
6.6  CONCLUSIONS
The development of a microbial pesticide or of a product isolated from plants or microorganisms for 
controlling pathogens requires several steps, beginning with their isolation in pure culture followed by 
screening of their efficacy by efficient bioassays performed in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo, up to pilot trials 
under real conditions of application. Similar steps are needed for the development of a product isolated 
from plants or microorganisms for controlling pathogens. Whereas efficiencies were shown in various 
cases, bacterial control of T. aggressivum and other green molds is almost the only case of develop-
ment of a BCA for the cultivation of A. bisporus mushrooms. Knowledge of the various mechanisms

of interaction between A. bisporus and its major pathogens is increasing and will help to develop new 
BCAs and environmentally friendly biomolecules for controlling the pathogens.
On the other hand, the development of a mushroom strain resistant to pathogens requires other 
steps addressed to the identification of genetic sources of resistance in native relatives or local strains, 
the understanding of the heritability of this genetic resistance, the production of hybrids and screening 
of their qualities, and finally making tests under real conditions of mushroom culture. The resistance 
mechanisms of A. bisporus to its major pathogens are complex and under polygenic control, but recent 
publications and works in progress on genetics and genomics open new opportunities to rapidly select 
new hybrids of A. bisporus resistant to at least one of its major pathogens. There is now a need for 
materialization of these prospects in mushroom farms.

EMERGING SOURCE OF 
MEDICINALS: CURRENT 
PERSPECTIVES

7.1  INTRODUCTION
Sclerotia, structures formed by the dense aggregation of mycelia, are important for fungal survival 
during adverse conditions, such as desiccation, microbial attack, or the long-term absence of a host 
(Townsend and Willetts, 1954; Coley-Smith and Cooke, 1971). The nutrients contained in the scle-
rotia allow the mushroom to enter a dormant stage when conditions are not favorable. The formation 
and development of sclerotia can be divided into three overlapping stages: initiation, development, 
and maturation; these are accompanied by morphological and biochemical differentiations under tight 
genetic control. Sclerotial initiation is usually induced by the onset of starvation or depletion of nutri-
ents and other conditions not favoring mycelial growth. Moreover, several endogenous and exogenous 
factors have been reported to affect the initiation process (Willets and Bullock, 1992). When conditions 
improve, growth resumes, often with the formation of fruiting bodies.
A recent discovery by Smith et al. (2015) revealed that sclerotium-forming fungi are phylogeneti-
cally distributed among 85 genera in 20 orders of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Of interest is the 
small number of Basidiomycetes (mushrooms) that are known to form sclerotia as part of their life 
cycle, though their sizes and morphology vary depending on the taxonomic position of each species. 
Some of the sclerotium-forming mushrooms (SFM), e.g., Lentinus tuber-regium, are known for their 
culinary and medicinal properties, whereas others are more commonly consumed for their medicinal 
benefits, such as Polyporus umbellatus, Wolfiporia cocos, Inonotus obliquus, and Lignosus spp. From 
the taxonomic point of view, these mushrooms belong to the family Polyporaceae.
Background information of selected SFM that will be discussed:
Lentinus tuber-regium (Fr.) Fr. (synonym: Pleurotus tuber-regium (Fr.) Singer), also known as the 
king tuber oyster mushroom, is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including Africa, Asia, and 
Australasia. In China, L. tuber-regium is called hunai (literally, tiger’s milk) and is found mainly in 

112
Chapter 7  SFM AS AN EMERGING SOURCE OF MEDICINALS
southern China (Deng et al., 2000). The sclerotium is round with outer dark brown skin and inner white 
flesh. Both the sclerotium and fruiting body are edible. Its medicinal properties, especially antitu-
mor and immunopotentiation activity, have been studied extensively (Zhang et al., 2001, 2004, 2006). 
Despite the growing interest in its medicinal properties and the sclerotial dietary fibers, industrial pro-
duction of L. tuber-regium has not been reported; nevertheless, there are numerous studies on its cul-
tivation using various agroresidues as substrates (Fasidi and Ekuere, 1993; Okhuoya and Etugo, 1993; 
Fasidi and Olorunmaiye, 1994; Isikhuemhen et al., 2000; Kuforiji and Fasidi, 2009).
Polyporus umbellatus (Pers.) Fr. (synonym, Grifola umbellata (Pers.) Pilat; Boletus umbellatus 
Pers.), sometimes referred to as “umbrella polypore” or “lumpy bracket,” is usually found growing 
in the form of fungal rosettes on the roots of deciduous hardwood trees, most often on birch, maple, 
beech, and oak trees (Choi et al., 2003). The mushroom is distributed in China, Japan, and temperate 
regions of the northern hemisphere. The fruiting body is deeply umbilicate, light brown, and composed 
of numerous caps with narrow white pores. The flesh of the sclerotium is white and rather soft when 
young but hardens with age. The sclerotium of P. umbellatus, known as zhuling (in Chinese) or chul-
ing (in Japanese) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for a wide range of ailments related 
to edema, scanty urine, vaginal discharge, and urinary dysfunction, as well as jaundice and diarrhea 
(Zhao, 2013). It is well known for its diuretic effect, which has been actively studied lately (Zhao et al., 
2009a; Zhang et al., 2010). Regarding acclimatization, outdoor cultivation has been reported (Choi 
et al., 2003). Moreover, there have also been attempts to understand the mechanism of sclerotial forma-
tion under artificial cultivation (Xing et al., 2013).
Wolfiporia cocos (F.A. Wolf) Ryvarden & Gilb (synonym: Poria cocos F.A. Wolf; Wolfiporia 
extensa (Peck) Ginns) is an example of a wood-decay fungus that is distributed in the southern prov-
inces of China. It is notable for the development of a large underground sclerotium, used in traditional 
Chinese medicine for inducing diuresis, excreting dampness, invigorating the spleen, and tranquiliz-
ing the mind. The inner part of the sclerotium is referred to as fu-ling (Wang et al., 2013). Fu-ling-pi, 
the epidermis of the sclerotia of W. cocos, which is removed in the preparation of fu-ling, is used as 
a diuretic, and this has been validated recently (Zhao et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2013). Other medicinal 
properties of W. cocos, notably antitumor (Chen and Chang, 2004), anti-inflammatory, and immunopo-
tentiation (Lee and Jeon, 2003), have been investigated. Research on the cultivation of W. cocos is still 
limited, but previous findings have indicated that indoor cultivation using bottles containing pine logs 
was successful (Kubo et al., 2006).
Inonotus obliquus (Ach. ex Pers.) Pilát (synonym: Boletus obliquus Ach. ex Pers), also known as 
the chaga mushroom, is a parasitic fungus that grows on birch and other trees, and produces a massive 
black, crusty conk, i.e., the sclerotium. It is also known as the clinker polypore, cinder conk, black 
mass, and birch canker polypore. Interestingly, it is sometimes called the tinder fungus due to its use 
as tinder for primitive fire starting techniques. The black appearance of the sclerotium is due to the 
presence of melanin pigments. The chaga mushroom is considered a medicinal species in Russian 
and Eastern European folk medicine to treat cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, digestive disor-
ders, liver ailments, and tuberculosis (Patel, 2015). Research on its medicinal properties, including its 
anticancer effects, is ongoing (Youn et al., 2008, 2009; Song et al., 2013; Ning et al., 2014). Artificial 
cultivation of I. obliquus has been described by Sun et al. (2011).
Lignosus spp. consist of members with centrally stipitate pilei arising from sclerotia buried in the 
ground. Of interest are several species that are found in Southeast Asia and China, known in Malaysia 
as cendawan susu rimau (literally, tiger’s milk mushroom in Malay) or hurulingzhi (literally, tiger milk 

113
7.2  The Importance of Mushroom Sclerotia
Ganoderma, in Chinese). Tiger’s milk mushrooms are claimed to have numerous medicinal properties 
by the local Malays and indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia. The sclerotium is the only part 
having medicinal properties (Lee et al., 2009). Overall, research on Lignosus spp. is still limited, and 
most reports have been on Lignosus rhinocerotis (Cooke) Ryvarden (synonym: Polyporus rhinocerus 
Cooke), the most commonly encountered Lignosus sp. in Malaysia (Choong et al., 2014). To date, its 
antitumor and immunomodulatory effects have been studied, and some positive results were obtained 
from in vitro and in vivo investigations (Lai et al., 2008; Wong et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Lau et al., 
2013b; Yap et al., 2013). Successful artificial cultivation of L. rhinocerotis was reported by Abdullah 
et al. (2013).
An earlier work by Wong and Cheung (2008b) discussed the cultivation and biochemical, nutri-
tional, and biopharmacological properties of the sclerotia of L. tuber-regium, W. cocos, and L. rhi-
nocerotis. There are also review articles dedicated solely to each species, including L. tuber-regium 
(Wong and Cheung, 2008a), W. cocos (Rios, 2011; Wang et al., 2013), I. obliquus (Shashkina et al., 
2006; Zhong et al., 2009), and P. umbellatus (Zhao, 2013). In view of the expansion of research on 
various aspects of the SFM, this chapter serves to provide more up-to-date findings on medicinal 
properties apart from the widely studied antitumor and immunomodulatory effects. Considering the 
limited supply of native sclerotia and the difficulties associated with the solid-substrate cultivation 
of mushroom sclerotia, the potential use of mycelia (derived from liquid fermentation) as substitutes 
for the sclerotia will be highlighted.
7.2  THE IMPORTANCE OF MUSHROOM SCLEROTIA
7.2.1  FOOD
Some mushroom sclerotia are important as food components, especially for indigenous peoples or rural 
communities; for instance, in Nigeria, the sclerotium of L. tuber-regium is considered a delicacy (Oso, 
1977). The sclerotium is frequently used in cooking and making various dishes. The sclerotium can 
be peeled and ground for use in a vegetable soup. Sometimes, the inner tissue is milled into a paste, 
which can be used to substitute in part or whole for melon seeds in the preparation of “egusi” soup, or 
mixed with corn flour and fried (Isikhuemhen and Okhuoya, 1995; Nwokolo, 1987). The nutritional 
attributes of L. tuber-regium have been extensively documented (Nwokolo, 1987; Fasidi and Ekuere, 
1993; Akindahunsi and Oyetayo, 2006). In addition, the physicochemical and functional properties of 
the sclerotial dietary fibers have been thoroughly studied (Wong et al., 2003, 2005, 2006; Wong and 
Cheung, 2005a,b).
7.2.2  FOLK MEDICINE
All of the aforementioned SFM are used as folk remedies. Notably, the sclerotium of P. tuber-regium is 
used in some combinations that are intended to cure headache, stomach ailments, colds, fever, asthma, 
smallpox, and high blood pressure (Oso, 1977; Fasidi and Olorunmaiye, 1994). Both P. umbellatus and 
W. cocos are part of traditional Chinese medicine, in which sclerotia are appreciated for their diuretic 
activity (Zhao, 2013). The chaga mushroom, on the other hand, has been used as a folk remedy in 
Russia and Siberia since the sixteenth century. In Russian folk medicine, the chaga mushroom is used 

114
Chapter 7  SFM AS AN EMERGING SOURCE OF MEDICINALS
to treat cancers, e.g., stomach and lung cancer, and it is likewise considered effective for other com-
mon stomach and intestinal ailments such as gastritis, ulcers, colitis, and general pain (Patel, 2015). 
In Southeast Asia, Lignosus spp. are important components of the traditional medicine of the local 
communities. Information from early literature and recent ethnomycological surveys has indicated that 
the sclerotia have been claimed to be effective in treating cancer, cough, asthma, fever, wound healing, 
and other ailments (Lee et al., 2009). In China, L. rhinocerotis is used as a medicine by physicians for 
treating gastric ulcer, liver cancer, and chronic hepatitis (Wong and Cheung, 2008b).
7.2.3  BIOACTIVE COMPONENTS FROM SFM
7.2.3.1  Low-molecular-weight compounds
Chemical investigations have resulted in the isolation and characterization of low-molecular-weight 
(LMW) compounds, mainly secondary metabolites, from the sclerotia and fruiting bodies of SFM. The 
compounds are often isolated from crude extracts by a combination of techniques involving liquid–
liquid extractions, column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC), and further characterized by various hyphenated techniques, e.g., liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and 
spectroscopic methods, e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance for structure elucidation. Most of the com-
pounds isolated from the sclerotia of P. umbellatus, I. obliquus, and W. cocos belong to the classes 
of steroids. Complete lists of compounds isolated from the mushrooms have been published earlier 
(Shashkina et al., 2006; Zhong et al., 2009; Rios, 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Zhao, 2013); hence, only 
some recent findings in chemical investigations of SFM will be highlighted here:
According to Zheng et al. (2010), I. obliquus has been documented to produce a diverse range 
of secondary metabolites, including phenolic compounds, melanins, and lanostane-type triterpenoids. 
Handa et al. (2010) isolated an unusual lanostane-type triterpenoid, i.e., spiroinonotsuoxodiol, and 
two lanostane-type triterpenoids identified as inonotsudiol A and inonotsuoxodiol A. A more recent 
study by Zhao et al. (2015) reported the isolation of three new lanostane-type triterpenes, namely 
inonotusanes A–C. Bioassay-guided fractionation of ethyl acetate extract from the sclerotium of P. 
umbellatus resulted in the isolation of three ergostane-type ecdysteroids, i.e., polyporoid A–C (Sun and 
Yasukawa, 2008). In the course of searching for marker components, two new polyporusterones were 
isolated from the sclerotia of P. umbellatus, together with another three known analogs (Zhou et al., 
2007). The structures of the new ones were elucidated as (20S,22R,24R)-16,22-epoxy-3β,14α,23β,25-
tetrahydroxyergost-7-en-6-one and (23R,24R,25R)-23,26-epoxy-3β,14α,21α,22α-tetrahydroxyergost-
7-en-6-one. A new pentacylic triterpene, 1β-hydroxylfriedelin, has been isolated and characterized 
(Zhao et al., 2009b). Working with the sclerotium of W. cocos, Zheng and Yang (2008) reported the 
isolated of two new lanostane triterpenoids, 29-hydroxypolyporenic acid C and 25-hydroxypachymic 
acid, together with known compounds, including ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, polyporenic acid C, and 
pachymic acid.
On the other hand, chemical investigations of the remaining SFM are limited, and in many cases 
chemical profiling was carried out without isolation and characterization by spectroscopic methods, 
and compound identification relied on comparison with authentic samples, databases, characteris-
tic fragmentation patterns, and UV absorption profiles. According to Afieroho and Ugoeze (2014), 
GC-MS analysis of the hexane extract of L. tuber-regium resulted in the identification of several fatty 

115
7.3  Scientific Validation of the Medicinal Properties of SFM
acids, such as linoleic acid and oleic acid, as well as steroids. Lin et al. (2014) identified typical phe-
nolic compounds including protocatechuic, chlorogenic, syringic, ferulic, and folic acids in the ethanol 
extract of L. tuber-regium using HPLC. Working with the extracts of L. rhinocerotis, Lau et al. (2014) 
identified several LMV compounds, including sugars, fatty acids, methyl esters, sterols, amides, amino 
acids, phenolics, and triterpenoids from the aqueous methanol extract of L. rhinocerotis using GC-MS 
and UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS.
7.2.3.2  High-molecular-weight compounds
High-molecular-weight (HMW) components, mostly hydrophilic polysaccharides, proteins, and poly-
saccharide–protein complexes, have received a lot of attention over the last decade. In general, poly-
saccharides are commonly extracted using water at different temperatures (e.g., boiling is a common 
method) or alkaline aqueous solutions. The crude polysaccharides will then be subjected to a series of 
purification steps which usually involve gel filtration (separation by sizes) and ion-exchange (separa-
tion by charge) chromatography to yield pure glucans. Characterization of polysaccharides includes 
determination of their molecular weight and the composition of monosaccharides by GC-MS following 
acid-hydrolysis of the polysaccharides. There are some excellent review papers regarding the isolation, 
characterization, and biological activities of mushroom polysaccharides, in which some of the sclerotial 
polysaccharides are described (Zhang et al., 2007; Cheung, 2013; Giavasis, 2014; Ruthes et al., 2015).
7.3  SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF THE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF SFM
The purported medicinal benefits of SFM, based on traditional practices, have been the subject of 
intense research in the past decade. Among the multitude of medicinal benefits of SFM reported in the 
literature, it was obvious that their antitumor and immunomodulatory effects received far more attention 
than other biological activities. In many cases, these effects are more often attributed to the hydrophilic 
HMW components, mainly in the form of polysaccharides, proteins, and/or polysaccharide–protein 
complexes that are typically abundant in aqueous preparations of culinary and medicinal mushrooms. 
These have been subjects of intense research and review by previous workers, although the focus was 
not only on SFM (Wasser and Weis, 1999; Wasser, 2002; Moradali et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; 
Patel and Goyal, 2012; Ren et al., 2012). Therefore, this time around, the focus is shifted to other bio-
logical properties of SFM that have received less attention and have not been systematically compiled, 
such as the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and neuritogenic effects, and 
their effects on the cardiovascular systems. Major findings pertaining to the aforementioned biological 
activities, especially information on potentially active compounds and their possible mode of action, 
will be highlighted.
7.3.1  ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY
Chemical components of the sclerotia, including the polysaccharides, proteins, and polysaccharide–
protein complexes, are best known for their antitumor activities. The extracts and fractions of SFM have 
been demonstrated to exhibit in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity; some are selective against cancer 
cells with lesser damage to the normal cells. Findings from in vitro studies have also revealed that, in 
many cases, cell death is attributed to apoptosis involving either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways.

116
Chapter 7  SFM AS AN EMERGING SOURCE OF MEDICINALS
Among the LMW compounds, secondary metabolites belonging to the classes of triterpenoids 
(including steroids) and phenolic acids have been identified as active compounds that target multiple 
pathways related to carcinogenesis, such as induction of apoptosis, prevention of metastasis, and inhi-
bition of angiogenesis. Numerous LMW compounds with cytotoxic effects against various cancer cells 
have been isolated from alcoholic extracts of SFM, but in-depth studies on potential mechanisms of 
action have been carried out for only a small number of antitumor metabolites. The mode of action of 
cytotoxic chemical constituents from the sclerotia of W. cocos and P. umbellatus has been actively stud-
ied. Chemical constituents from the sclerotium of W. cocos, such as dehydropachymic acid, pachymic 
acid, and tumulosic acid, were reported to exhibit moderate cytotoxicity against human colon carci-
noma cells (Li et al., 2004). Further, pachymic acid inhibited the proliferation of human pancreatic 
cancer cells (Panc-1, MiaPaca-2, AsPc-1, BxPc-3) without affecting the normal pancreatic duct epi-
thelial cells (HPDE-6), causing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase as well as downregulating the expres-
sion of KRAS and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) in BxPc-3 cells. At the same time, pachymic 
acid also suppressed the invasive behavior of BxPc-3 cells, and this was associated with a reduction 
of MMP-7 at the protein level (Kikuchi et al., 2011). Previously isolated cytotoxic constituents from 
the sclerotium of P. umbellatus are mainly steroids (Zhao et al., 2010). One of the compounds, ergone, 
displayed remarkable cytotoxicity against Hep G2, Hep-2, and Hela cells without affecting normal 
cells (HUVEC).
Based on the work of Zhao et al. (2011), the cytotoxicity of ergone against Hep G2 was attributed to 
apoptosis, which was evidenced by cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage, chromatin condensation, nuclear 
fragmentation, and externalization of phosphatidylserine. Both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic path-
ways were involved based on the occurrence of PARP-cleavage, activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and 
upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2. Inotodiol isolated from I. obliquus was shown to be 
a potent antitumor agent in a two-stage carcinogenesis test on mouse skin using 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]
anthracene as an initiator and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) as a promoter (Nakata et al., 2007). 
Some of the compounds were able to inhibit DNA topoisomerases; for instance, Mizushina et al. (2004) 
reported that dehydroebriconic and dehydrotrametenoic acids inhibited DNA topoisomerase II activity 
(IC50: 4.6 μM), while both compounds moderately inhibited the activities of DNA polymerases α, β, γ, 
δ, ɛ, η, ι, κ, and λ in mammals to similar extents. Both compounds also suppressed the growth of human 
gastric cancer cells and induced cell cycle arrest. Chemical investigation on the sclerotial LMW of 
L. tuber-regium is limited, but a recent study by Lin et al. (2014) demonstrated that a 60% (v/v) ethanol 
extract of P. tuber-regium sclerotium inhibited the vascular endothelial growth factor-induced human 
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and tube formation. Moreover, the phenolics-rich 
extract also inhibited the formation of subintestinal vessel plexus in zebrafish embryos in vivo.
HMW components are known to exhibit antitumor activity via modulation of the immune system. 
Their activities were affected by a number of factors, namely molecular weight, degree of branching, 
solubility, type of side linkages, and other physicochemical characteristics, as reviewed by Zhang et al. 
(2007). The antiproliferative effects of L. tuber-regium are largely attributed to the sclerotial water-
soluble components, mainly polysaccharides. In a study by Tao et al. (2006), a water-soluble β-glucan 
extracted from the sclerotia was fractionated into eight fractions, five of which were sulfated. In the 
in vitro cytotoxicity test, the sulfated derivatives were relatively more cytotoxic than the native glucan 
fractions. Wong et al. (2007) reported that the nonstarch polysaccharides exerted strong cytotoxic-
ity against human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and induced apoptosis. Zhang et al. 
(2006) explored the antiproliferative effect of a water-soluble carboxymethylated β-glucan partially

synthesized from an insoluble native glucan isolated from L. tuber-regium sclerotium. It inhibited the 
growth of MCF7 (IC50: 204 μg/mL) and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, which was also 
associated with the downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E expressions and increased expression of 
the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Zhang et al. (2011) demonstrated that the aqueous extract and polysaccharides of 
P. umbellatus sclerotium inhibited bladder carcinogenesis in rats, which may be associated with upreg-
ulation of glutathione S-transferase π (GSTPi) and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (NQO1) in 
the bladder. Chen and Chang (2004) isolated a neutral polysaccharide fraction from W. cocos (desig-
nated as PC-PS, 160 kDa) by a series of chromatographic separations, and its antiproliferative activity 
against human leukemic cells U937 and HL-60 was investigated in vitro. They found that the condi-
tioned medium prepared with PC-PS (15 μg/mL) stimulated human blood mononuclear cells for 5 days 
suppressed the proliferation of U937 and HL-60 cells by 87.3% and 74.7%, respectively.
According to Youn et al. (2008), water extract of I. obliquus inhibited the growth of Hep G2 cells 
in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied with G0/G1-phase arrest and apoptotic cell death. At the 
molecular level, cell cycle arrest was associated with downregulation of p53, pRb, p27, cyclins D1, D2, 
and E, and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 expression. Working on the melanoma 
cell lines B16-F10, Youn et al. (2009) found that the water extract of I. obliquus also suppressed the 
growth of cells and induced apoptosis, and these were associated with the downregulation of pRb, p53, 
and p27 expression levels. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of I. obliquus extract, at a dose 
of 20 mg/kg for 10 days, inhibited tumor progression in B16-F10 cells implanted mice—lear evidence 
of in vivo antitumor effects. Among the SFM, studies on the antiproliferative activity of the sclerotial 
aqueous extracts of L. rhinocerotis are limited. Sclerotial hot and cold aqueous extract was reported to 
moderately inhibit the growth of leukemic and solid-tumor cell lines (Lai et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2012; 
Lau et al., 2013b; Yap et al., 2013). The cytotoxic action of a cold aqueous extract against MCF7 was 
found to be mediated by apoptosis, based on DNA fragmentation studies (Lee et al., 2012). The nature 
of cytotoxic components in the sclerotium of L. rhinocerotis has yet to be identified but is suspected to 
involve some HMV components, either proteins or protein–carbohydrate complex (Lee et al., 2012), 
and these are heat-sensitive (Lau et al., 2013b).
It has been established that chemical modification might enhance the antitumor properties of mush-
room polysaccharides; for instance, Tao et  al. (2009) extracted two water-soluble polysaccharide–
protein complexes from the sclerotium of P. tuber-regium and chemically modified them to obtain their 
sulfated and carboxymethylated derivatives, which both showed good cytotoxicity against cancer cells. 
In another study by Wang et al. (2004), a water-insoluble (1→3)-β-glucan isolated from the sclerotium 
of W. cocos was sulfated, carboxymethylated, methylated, hydroxyethylated, and hydroxypropylated, 
respectively, to afford five water-soluble derivatives. The authors reported that the native β-glucan did 
not show antitumor activity, whereas the sulfated and carboxymethylated derivatives exhibited signifi-
cant antitumor activities against S-180 and gastric carcinoma tumor cells. As reported by Chen et al. 
(2009), (1→3)-β-glucan isolated from W. cocos was phosphorylated to obtain a series of derivatives that 
exhibited relatively strong inhibition against S-180 tumor cells (Chen et al., 2009).
7.3.2  IMMUNOMODULATORY ACTIVITY
The HMW from SFM are sometimes called biological response modifiers, as they are known to 
modulate the immune system. Various polysaccharides, proteins, and polysaccharide–protein com-
plexes from SFM have been reported to exert an immunomodulatory effect. According to Chang et al. 

118
Chapter 7  SFM AS AN EMERGING SOURCE OF MEDICINALS
(2009), an immunomodulatory protein (designated PCP, 35.6 kDa) from the sclerotium of W. cocos 
stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages through the induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) 
and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-related gene expres-
sion. Further, in vivo work demonstrated that PCP activated peritoneal cavity macrophages to induce 
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent signaling. Ma et al. 
(2010) evaluated the immunomodulatory effect of a polysaccharide-rich fraction (designated PRF) of 
the sclerotium of W. cocos. Oral administration of PRF at 200 mg/kg body weight to immunized mice 
increased the T-cell percentage among splenocytes but reduced anti-OVA immunoglobulin G and M 
levels significantly, indicating that PRF could modulate the specific immune response of Balb/c mice 
and that the modulation occurs via the activation of T cells. Kim (2005) evaluated the immunomodula-
tory effect of an aqueous extract of I. obliquus. Oral administration of the extract increased serum levels 
of IL-6 and suppressed an NF-α-related pathologic condition. Fan et al. (2012) purified a water-soluble 
polysaccharide (designated ISP2a) from I. obliquus. ISP2a was reported to enhance the proliferation 
of lymphocytes and increased production of TNF-α. In another study by Li et al. (2010), a polysac-
charide isolated from P. umbellatus promoted the activation and maturation of murine bone marrow-
derived dendritic cells (BMDC) via TLR4. Treatment of BMDC with the sclerotial polysaccharides 
resulted in enhanced cell-surface expression of CD86, enhanced production of both IL-12 p40 and 
IL-10, increased T-cell-stimulatory capacity, and decreased phagocytic ability. Further, the sclerotial 
polysaccharides were found to upregulate the functions of macrophages such as nitric oxide (NO) pro-
duction and cytokine expression (Li et al., 2011).
The effect of extracts of L. rhinocerotis on the immune system have received vast attention. Wong 
et al. (2009) reported the stimulation of human innate immune cells by sclerotial polysaccharides from 
L. rhinocerotis. The sclerotial polysaccharides were found to upregulate the expression of Dectin-1 
in NK-92MI and MD but not CD56+ NK cells, suggesting that Dectin-1 might act as the receptor for 
binding of sclerotial polysaccharides. In a separate study, Guo et al. (2011) found that the sclerotial 
hot aqueous extract (25 µg/mL) enhanced the functional activities of RAW 264.7 and murine primary 
macrophages. The hot aqueous extract also increased the phosphorylation of IKBα, which could trigger 
the NF-κB signaling pathway for macrophage activation.
7.3.3  ANTIOXIDATIVE ACTIVITY
There are numerous studies directed to analysis of the antioxidant capacity of extracts, fractions, and 
isolated compounds in both cellular and animal models. Earlier studies have established the correla-
tion between antioxidant capacity and the phenolic contents of various mushrooms, including SFM. 
Liang et al. (2009) evaluated the antioxidant capacity of a crude ethanol extract of I. obliquus and its 
subfractions (ethyl acetate fraction, n-butanol fraction, and aqueous fraction). The results showed that 
the extent of antioxidant activity is in accordance with the amounts of phenolics and flavonoids. In 
a study by Lin et al. (2014), the aqueous ethanol extract of L. tuber-regium sclerotium showed good 
antioxidant activity, which might be attributed to the presence of several phenolic compounds, includ-
ing protocatechuic, chlorogenic, syringic, ferulic, and folic acids. Based on a report by Nakajima et al. 
(2007), the aqueous methanol extract of I. obliquus, which demonstrated strong antioxidative activity, 
was subjected to further purification that resulted in the isolation of 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy benzoic 
acid, 2-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl ethyl ester, protocatechic acid, caffeic acid, 3,4-dihybenzaladehyde, 
2,5-dihydroxyterephtalic acid, syringic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzalacetone.

119
7.3  Scientific Validation of the Medicinal Properties of SFM
The antioxidative compounds from SFM are not limited to phenolics, but there is increasing evidence 
that polysaccharides might also play a role; for instance, the water-soluble and alkaline-soluble polysaccha-
rides from P. tuber-regium were studied for their in vitro antioxidant properties (Wu et al., 2014). Results 
indicated that the alkaline-soluble polysaccharides were stronger than water-soluble polysaccharides in the 
scavenging of free radicals, as well as in their inhibitory effect on liver lipid peroxidation, liver mitochon-
dria swelling, and red blood cell hemolysis. Tang et al. (2014) prepared polysaccharides (designated PCP-1, 
PCP-2, and PCP-3) from the degradation of W. cocos polysaccharides (PCP) with different concentrations 
of H2O2 solution. These exhibited antioxidant activity, as demonstrated by the scavenging of hydroxyl 
radicals, ABTS radicals, and ferrous ions. In addition, the polysaccharides demonstrated DNA protective 
activity. Mu et al. (2012) compared the antioxidant capacity of the water-soluble and alkali-soluble crude 
polysaccharides (designated IOW and IOA, respectively) isolated from I. obliquus, and the carbohydrate-
rich fractions IOW-1 and IOA-1 were obtained, respectively, after deproteination and depigmentation. The 
polysaccharides scavenged DPPH, hydroxyl, and superoxide anion radicals in a dose-dependent manner. 
These polysaccharides also afforded protection against oxidative stress in PC12 cells.
It is worth pointing out that the contribution of polyphenolic and polysaccharide fractions from 
SFM is still not conclusive. In a work by Cui et al. (2005), the polyphenolic-rich extracts as well as 
triterpenoid- and steroid-rich extracts exhibited moderate antioxidant effects by scavenging 1,1-diphe-
nyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, and peroxyl radicals; however, the polysaccharide extracts 
were inactive. Nevertheless, only the polyphenolic extract protected the human keratinocyte cell line 
(HaCaT) from H2O2-induced oxidative stress, whereas the polysaccharide, triterpenoid, and steroid 
extracts were ineffective.
The antioxidant capacity of Lignosus spp. has been reported recently. Yap et al. (2013) compared 
the antioxidant properties of the hot water, cold water, and methanol extracts of the cultivated and wild-
type sclerotium of L. rhinocerotis. The DPPH, ABTS, and superoxide anion radical scavenging activi-
ties of the extracts ranged from 0.52 to 1.12, 0.05 to 0.20, and −0.98 to 11.23 mmol Trolox equivalents/g 
extract, respectively, whereas FRAP values ranged from 0.006 to 0.016 mmol/min/g extract. Working 
with Lignosus tigris, Yap et al. (2014) reported that FRAP values ranged from 0.002 to 0.041 mmol/
min/g extract, while the DPPH, ABTS, and superoxide anion scavenging activities ranged from 0.18 to 
2.53, 0.01 to 0.36, and −4.53 to 10.05 mmol Trolox equivalents/g extract, respectively. Taken together, 
on the basis of antioxidant capacity, preliminary results indicate that both L. rhinocerotis and L. tigris 
cultivars showed good prospects of being developed into functional foods, although the extracts of the 
wild-type samples appeared to be more potent.
In addition, the antioxidant capacity of SFM is associated with potential antiaging effects. A study 
by Yun et al. (2011) demonstrated that I. obliquus exerted protective effects against H2O2-induced apop-
tosis and premature senescence in human fibroblasts. In addition, I. obliquus suppressed UV-induced 
morphologic skin changes, such as skin thickening and wrinkle formation, in hairless mice in vivo, 
and increased collagen synthesis through inhibition of MMP-1 and MMP-9 activities in H2O2-treated 
human fibroblasts. These results seem to provide some indication of potential antiaging effects of 
I. obliquus. In another study, the protective effects of W. cocos water extract (designated as PCW) 
against Aβ1–42-induced cell death were investigated using rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (Park 
et al., 2009). Pretreatment with PCW (5–125 µg/mL) reduced Aβ1–42-induced cell death, and attenu-
ated cytotoxicity, apoptotic features, and accumulation of intracellular oxidative damage. Moreover, 
the expression of apoptotic protein Bax and activity of caspase-3 were decreased, but the expression of 
an antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased.

Chapter 7  SFM AS AN EMERGING SOURCE OF MEDICINALS
7.3.4  ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY
Crude extracts of SFM were found to have anti-inflammatory activity, and bioactive compounds are 
usually triterpenoids (including steroids). According to Ma et al. (2013), petroleum ether and ethyl ace-
tate fractions of P. umbellatus were found to have significant inhibition effects on NO production and 
NF-κB luciferase activity in RAW 264.7 cells. According to Sun and Yasukawa (2008), compounds iso-
lated from P. umbellatus, namely polyporoid A–C and other known ecdysteroids, demonstrated potent 
anti-inflammatory activity in a test of TPA-induced inflammation (1 µg/ear) in mice. Fuchs et al. (2006) 
evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of W. cocos extracts on experimentally induced irritant contact 
dermatitis (ICD) in a repeated sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) irritation model.
The anti-inflammatory efficacy of the extract on the elicitation phase of the ICD induced by repeated 
SLS test could be observed, and this might be attributed to its influence on proinflammatory enzymes 
such as phospholipase A2. In another study by Cuellar et al. (1997), a hydroalcoholic extract from 
W. cocos was examined for oral and topical anti-inflammatory activity. It was shown to be active against 
carrageenan, arachidonic acid, TPA acute edemas, TPA chronic inflammation, and oxazolone delayed 
hypersensitivity in mice. Dehydrotumulosic and pachymic acids were identified as active compounds.
There are increasing studies to unravel the molecular mechanism of action; however, it seems that 
most work was carried out using crude extracts rather than pure compounds; for instance, the ethanol 
extract of I. obliquus inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 mac-
rophages (Kim et al., 2007).
The inhibition of LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cycloox-
ygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins was mediated by Akt and JNK pathways. Jeong et al. (2014) demon-
strated the anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extract of W. cocos in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 
macrophages. They reported that the extract targeted the inflammatory response of macrophages via 
inhibition of iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, and TNF-α through inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathways.
The anti-inflammatory activity of L. rhinocerotis is of interest as the mushroom is traditionally 
used to relieve cough, asthma, and chronic hepatitis, all of which are presumably related to its anti-
inflammatory effect. According to Lee et al. (2014), the cold water extract (CWE) of the sclerotial 
powder of L. rhinocerotis TM02 cultivar possessed potent antiacute inflammatory activity as measured 
by the carrageenan-induced paw edema test. Nevertheless, CWE at 200 mg/kg did not inhibit transu-
dative and proliferative phases of chronic inflammation, as shown by using the cotton pellet induced 
granuloma model. The anti-inflammatory activity of CWE was mainly attributed to its HMW fraction, 
but the precise component has yet to be identified and/or isolated.
7.3.5  ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY
The antimicrobial activities of SFM have received far lesser attention when compared to other medici-
nal properties. Chemistry-wise, the antimicrobial activities of SFM are mostly attributed to the LMW 
compounds that are present in the organic solvent extracts rather than the components in aqueous 
extracts. Current findings seem to indicate that the extracts and fractions of SFM showed inhibitory 
effect on Gram-positive and negative bacteria but inactive against several pathogenic fungi. In view of 
its role in fungal survival, it is hypothesized that the sclerotium might produce chemical components 
(e.g., secondary metabolites) for defense against other antagonistic microorganisms, which might be 
exploited as antimicrobial compounds.

121
7.3  Scientific Validation of the Medicinal Properties of SFM
On the contrary, so far, studies carried out on L. tuber-regium seem to suggest that the fruiting body, 
rather than the sclerotium, is a better source of antimicrobial compounds. Ezeronye et al. (2005) found 
that only the ethanol extract of the fruiting bodies showed antibacterial activity. The ethanol extract 
of the sclerotium, as well as the aqueous extracts of the fruiting body and sclerotium, were not active. 
These findings were confirmed by Jonathan et al. (2008), who reported that the crude methanol and ethyl 
acetate fractions of the fruiting body of L. tuber-regium showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus 
cereus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus vulgaris. The antimicrobial activity of the 
sclerotium belonging to L. rhinocerotis was demonstrated by Mohanarji et al. (2012). It was proved that 
the methanol and aqueous extracts showed stronger antibacterial activity than did the petroleum ether 
and chloroform extracts, suggesting that the active compounds are likely to be polar in nature.
7.3.6  ANTIHYPERTENSIVE ACTIVITY AND RELATED CARDIOVASCULAR 
COMPLICATIONS
In most studies, in vitro inhibition of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is taken as indicative 
of potential antihypertensive activity in vivo. Although there are no reports on the inhibitory effect of 
mushroom sclerotia against ACE, the antihypertensive effect of sclerotial extracts has been demon-
strated. A recent study revealed that the sclerotial aqueous extract of L. tuber-regium was reported to 
lower the systolic, diastolic, pulse, and mean arterial pressures of salt-loaded rats in a dose-dependent 
manner (Ikewuchi et al., 2014). Chemical analysis indicated that the aqueous extracts contained fla-
vonoids (kaempferol, quercetin, and hesperidin) and sterols; therefore, the hypotensive activity of the 
aqueous extract might have been due to these compounds. In addition, Ikewuchi et al. (2013) investi-
gated the effect of L. tuber-regium aqueous extract on the biochemical and hematological indices in 
normal and subchronic salt-loaded rats. Their results indicated that, compared to test controls, the treat-
ment lowered the mean cell volume, atherogenic indices (cardiac risk ratio, atherogenic coefficient, and 
atherogenic index of plasma), plasma alanine and aspartate transaminase activities, mean cell hemo-
globin, sodium, bicarbonate, urea, blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and total, non-high-density, low-
density, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, as well as neutrophil, monocyte, 
and platelet counts in the treated animals. However, treatment with the extract increased hemoglobin 
concentration, mean cell hemoglobin, red cell and lymphocyte counts, plasma high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol, calcium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, albumin, and total protein concentrations 
in the treated animals. Taken together, the results seemed to suggest that the antihypertensive activity 
of L. tuber-regium may be mediated through alteration of plasma levels of sodium and potassium, or 
increases in muscle tone brought about by changes in plasma calcium levels.
7.3.7  ANTIDIABETIC ACTIVITY
Studies on the antidiabetic activity of SFM are still limited. Earlier, Li et al. (2011) investigated the 
effect of W. cocos on type 2 diabetes. The sclerotial crude extract at 50 mg/kg body weight or more 
significantly decreased blood glucose levels in db/db mice. Some of the bioactive constituents identi-
fied from the chloroform extract and subfractions are dehydrotumulosic acid, dehydrotrametenolic 
acid, and pachymic acid. Mechanistic study on streptozocin (STZ)-treated mice revealed that the crude 
extract, dehydrotumulosic acid, dehydrotrametenolic acid, and pachymic acid exhibited different levels 
of insulin sensitizer activity but did not activate the PPAR pathway.

122
Chapter 7  SFM AS AN EMERGING SOURCE OF MEDICINALS
7.3.8  DIURETIC ACTIVITY
Some of the SFM, namely P. umbellatus and P. cocos, have been reported to have diuretic activity, 
while no work has been done on L. tuber-regium, I. obliquus, and L. rhinocerotis. Zhao et al. (2009a,b) 
evaluated various extracts of P. umbellatus sclerotium for diuretic activity, in which oral administration 
of the n-hexane and n-butanol extracts led to a significant increase in the urinary volume. Bioassay-
guided isolation of the active extracts led to the isolation and identification of ergone, ergosterol, and 
d-mannitol. All isolated compounds increased the cumulative urinary volume excretion compared to 
the control. d-mannitol was found to affect the excretion of potassium, sodium, and chloride, whereas 
ergone did not produce a similar effect. The diuretic activity of ergosterol was suspected to be due to 
its conversion into ergone by dioxygenase in vivo.
Zhang et al. (2010) reported the diuretic activity of the sclerotial aqueous extract of P. umbellatus. 
Oral administration of the aqueous extract led to an increase in the total volume of urine excreted as well 
as the levels of Na+, K+, and Cl−. In an attempt to gain insight into the possible role of the aquaporin 
(AQP) family on water reabsorption in different regions of the kidney, their mRNA expression level was 
investigated. Postoral administration of the sclerotial aqueous extract did not affect the level of AQP1 
and AQP3 but downregulated the mRNA expression of AQP2 and V2R relative to the controls in normal 
rat kidney medulla. Taken together, the sclerotial aqueous extract of P. umbellatus exerted a diuretic 
effect by regulating AQP2, and the downregulation of AQP2 might be due to the downregulation of 
V2R. The epidermis layer of the sclerotium of W. cocos has been claimed to have a diuretic effect.
In a study by Zhao et al. (2012), the sclerotial ethanol and aqueous extracts of W. cocos were 
investigated for potential diuretic activity in saline-loaded rats. It was found that the ethanol extract 
significantly increased urinary excretion rates compared to the aqueous extract. The ethanol extract also 
increased the excretion of Na+ but produced little or no effect on K+. Due to the remarkable diuretic 
effect of the ethanol extract, it was fractionated by liquid–liquid partitions to yield fractions of different 
polarity, i.e., petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and aqueous fractions. The fractions produced 
different degrees of diuretic activity, but it was noted that the ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions gave 
the highest activity. Oral administration of the ethyl acetate fraction (400 mg/kg) significantly enhanced 
the Na+/K+ ratio, whereas the n-butanol fraction only slightly increased the Na+/K+ value. Recently, 
Wu et al. (2014) found that the scleroderma of P. cocos exhibited its diuretic effect by suppression of 
renal AQP2 expression in rats with chronic heart failure.
Some chemical constituents have been identified as active components from organic solvent extracts, 
whereas the active components from aqueous extracts have yet to be determined. So far, only steroidal 
constituents, i.e., ergone and ergosterol, and d-mannitol, a known light diuretic, have been identified 
as diuretic agents. Chemistry-wise, triterpenoids are abundant in mushroom sclerotia, and tetracyclic 
triterpenoids that present a structural similarity to aldosterone and its antagonist spironolactone (a 
potassium saver prototype diuretic). On the assumption that compounds that have similar chemical 
structures will give the same effect, the triterpenoids were suspected to be the active compounds with 
diuretic activity in SFM.
7.3.9  NEURITOGENIC ACTIVITY
Studies on the neuritogenic potential of mushroom sclerotia are limited; however, previous work has 
demonstrated the ability of the extracts of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium to stimulate neurite outgrowth 

123
7.4  PERSPECTIVES ON MYCELIAL BIOMASS AS A POTENTIAL SUBSTITUTE
using PC-12 Adh (rat pheochromocytoma, adherent variant) and Neuro-2a (mouse neuroblastoma) 
cell lines as in vitro neuronal models (Eik et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2012). Treatment of the cells with 
sclerotial aqueous and ethanol extracts led to a significant increase in the number of neurite-bearing 
cells compared to the untreated control. The mechanism of the action has not been fully explored, but 
preliminary results obtained from work using specific inhibitors seem to indicate the involvement of 
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/ERK1/2) signaling path-
ways (Seow et al., 2013). The chemical components of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium with neuritogenic 
potential, however, have yet to be identified.
7.4  PERSPECTIVES ON MYCELIAL BIOMASS AS A POTENTIAL SUBSTITUTE 
FOR SCLEROTIA AND FRUITING BODIES
As the main supply of the sclerotia of the SFM mentioned earlier is from their natural habitat, the 
difficulty in harvesting sufficient amounts of samples has caused researchers to shift the focus to the 
mycelia as potential substitutes. While the cultivation of some SFM has been established, large-scale 
production has not been reached to date. Another aspect to be considered would be the chemical com-
position of the mycelia and culture broth and the associated medicinal properties.
7.4.1  CULTIVATION
The lack of understanding of the life cycle of SFM has emerged as one of the biggest constraints in 
improving the cultivation process. The use of solid-substrate fermentation is time consuming, and the 
fruiting bodies and sclerotia formed are dependent on environmental conditions which might affect 
the yield and quality of the mushroom products. In most cases, the bottleneck appears to be the way 
to induce formation of sclerotia in the fastest time possible. Previous work demonstrated that burial of 
mycelia-colonized substrate bags and continuous watering are some of the commonly used techniques 
to induce fructification.
The cultivation of L. rhinocerotis requires more than a year to obtain the fruiting bodies and sclero-
tia. Pilot cultivation of L. rhinocerotis (Figure 7.1) carried out using an optimized formulation consist-
ing of sawdust, paddy straw, and spent yeast at a ratio of 7.9:1:1 in bags yielded mycelial growth rate 
of 3.8±0.8 mm/day. Sclerotia formation was induced by burying matured colonized substrate in soil. 
Sclerotia weighing between 80 and 120 g on a fresh weight basis were formed 3–4 weeks after burial, 
and this was followed by sporophore formation, 8–12 months after burial (Abdullah et al., 2013). 
On the contrary, cultivation of some SFM can be relatively easy. Under similar conditions, the fruit-
ing body and sclerotium of L. tuber-regium can be produced in a shorter time (Figure 7.2). In fact, 
L. tuber-regium can be cultivated by planting the sclerotium in damp soil, and in some cases a scle-
rotium can be peeled and both the inner, edible white portion and outer peeling can independently 
produce mushrooms.
As opposed to solid-substrate fermentation, liquid fermentation enables year-round production in a 
limited space. Mycelia formed by growing pure cultures in submerged conditions are of constant com-
position, and submerged culture is considered to be the best technique for obtaining consistent and safe 
mushroom products. Several authors have reviewed the use of liquid fermentation techniques for the pro-
duction of mycelial biomass and culture broth (Zhong and Tang, 2004; Gregori et al., 2007; Tang et al.,

7.4  PERSPECTIVES ON MYCELIAL BIOMASS AS A POTENTIAL SUBSTITUTE
2007; Elisashvili, 2012). The optimization of culture conditions to obtain high mycelial biomass and bio-
active compounds, such as endo- and exopolysaccharides has been intensively studied (Wu et al., 2003, 
2004). The potential of using liquid fermentation for the production of mycelial biomass is enormous.
7.4.2  CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS
From a nutritional point of view, the chemical composition of mycelia, in many cases, is comparable to 
that of the sclerotium. As reported by Lau et al. (2013a), the proximate composition of the mycelium 
of L. rhinocerotis was found to be comparable to that of the sclerotium, in which carbohydrates were 
dominant with smaller amount of proteins and low levels of fat. However, there are also differences in 
the bioactive constituents when SFM are cultured by liquid fermentation compared to the fruiting bod-
ies and sclerotia derived from solid-substrate fermentation; for instance, Zheng et al. (2008) reported 
that phenolics detected in submerged cultures of I. obliquus consisted of flavonoids, small amounts 
of melanins, and trace elements of hispidin analogs, whereas in the sclerotium, hispidin analogs and 
melanins were dominant.
While the factors that influence the production of intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides 
have been extensively studied, similar work on the secondary metabolites has received less attention. 
Studies on the fungal metabolite biosynthesis pathways enable us to understand the production of 
metabolites under different conditions and to exploit this knowledge to foster the overexpression pro-
duction of metabolites of interest. The possibility of manipulating culture conditions to alter the fungal 
biosynthesis pathways for the production of metabolites has been demonstrated by several workers 
using I. obliquus as a model organism. Steroids and phenolics are among the important bioactive com-
pounds in I. obliquus, but cultured mycelium has contained lower amount of steroids compared to 
wild-growing mushrooms (Zheng et al., 2008).
In order to increase the amount of steroids in I. obliquus (as a model organism) cultured by sub-
merged fermentation, several strategies have been followed. One plausible method is to mimic its 
growth condition in the natural habitat by introducing chemical components from host-related species 
to stimulate mycelial biomass and fungal metabolite production. Wang et al. (2014) reported that aque-
ous and methanol extracts of birch bark and core resulted in increased steroid content of I. obliquus 
grown in submerged cultures. Production of several steroids, namely botulin, ergosterol, cholesterol, 
lanosterol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol, was reported to have increased between 45.2% and 166.8% 
compared to those in the control group, when treated with 0.01 g/L of birch bark aqueous extracts. 
While the precise molecular mechanism involved in stimulating steroid biosynthesis has not been elu-
cidated, the chemical components of the birch extracts were speculated to play a role.
The production of fungal secondary metabolites is often viewed as a consequence of the environ-
mental stress faced by the fungus in its natural habitat. The production of some metabolites has been 
associated with a possible role in fungal defense against antagonistic microorganisms. The lack of these 
environmental stresses in laboratory conditions has been suggested as the likely factor in the lower pro-
duction of the metabolites. A technique involving coculture of two microorganisms has been studied; 
the relevance of the presence of another microbe is to induce the biosynthesis of antagonistic metabo-
lites. Coculture of I. obliquus and Phellinus punctatus was attempted by Zheng et al. (2011b). Under 
their experimental cultivation, the decrease in mycelial biomass production was accompanied by the 
accumulation of several metabolites from the classes of phenolics, melanins, and lanostane-type triter-
penoids. It was postulated that the gene clusters responsible for production of metabolites with possible 

126
Chapter 7  SFM AS AN EMERGING SOURCE OF MEDICINALS
roles in defense were upregulated when the mushroom species were cocultured. The ethanol:acetone 
extracts derived from the mycelia of co-cultures demonstrated higher radical scavenging activities and 
inhibitory effects against tumor cell proliferation than those from monocultures.
Another method to enhance the production of fungal metabolites is to alter the composition of 
culture media and conditions. For instance, the effects of culture media on the accumulation of ster-
oids in the mycelium of I. obliquus have been studied by Zheng et al. (2008). It was reported that 
culture media consisting (w/v) of glucose (1.5%), rice powder (0.5%), yeast extract (0.4%), wheat bran 
(0.1%), KH2PO4 (0.01%), and MgSO4·7H2O (0.05%) with pH adjusted to 6.5 yielded the maximum 
production of lanosterol and ergosterol. Further, supplementation of metal ions such as Ag+, Cu+, and 
Ca2+ had positive effects on the accumulation of the sterols, which was thought to be mediated by 
enhanced expression of the HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase) gene. 
Zhu and Xu (2013) demonstrated that several lignocellulosic materials increased the production of 
intra- and extracellular phenolic compounds in I. obliquus; for instance, the production of phenolics 
was enhanced by the addition of wheat straw (45.3–151.2%), sugarcane bagasse (26.1–106.9%), and 
rice straw (38.9–67.6%), and the extracts exhibited higher radical scavenging activity than those of 
the control media. The supplementation of lignocellulosic materials affected the chemical profiles of 
I. obliquus. Davallialactone and inoscavin B were detected in the extracellular phenolic extracts in the 
lignocellulosic media but not in the control media. The difference in enhancement among the materials 
was suggested to be related to the content and degradation rate of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.
The production of phenolics by I. obliquus in submerged cultures was also enhanced by imposing 
oxidative stress. As demonstrated by Zheng et al. (2009a,b,c), the addition of H2O2 and simultaneous 
addition of H2O2 and arbutin to the culture medium increased the levels of intracellular phenolics but 
lowered the production of extracellular phenolics. The production of melanins, on the other hand, was 
improved by the addition of H2O2.
The effect of abiotic and biotic factors has been studied as well. The regulation of light on the biosyn-
thesis of phenolics in I. obliquus has been investigated by Zheng et al. (2009a,b,c). It was demonstrated 
that the production of davallialactone, phelligridins, and other hispidin analogs was inhibited by day-
light illumination, whereas their biosynthesis was stimulated under continuous darkness. In addition, 
both compounds were detected in mycelium grown in blue and red light with levels lower than those 
found in darkness. Polyphenols produced under daylight conditions were reported to exhibit lower anti-
oxidant capacity than those produced with other light regimes. Zheng et al. (2009a,b,c) investigated the 
role of NO in the production of phenolics in I. obliquus. The use of a fungal elicitor in the form of cell 
debris from the plant-pathogenic ascomycete Alternaria alternata increased the production of NO, and 
this was accompanied by increases in the levels of hispidin analogs such as inoscavins, phelligridins, 
davallilactone, and methyldavallialactone. It was deduced that the production of phenolics in I. obliquus 
was mediated by signaling pathways independent of oxylipins or jasmonic acid, a different mechanism 
from those in some higher plants. Further studies demonstrated that higher NO levels coincided with 
accumulation of S-nitrosothiols (SNO) and higher activity of denitrosylated S-nitrosoglutathione reduc-
tase (GSNOR) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (Zheng et al., 2011a). The state of S-nitrosylation and 
denitrosylation affects the accumulation of phenolics and the fungal metabolic profile.
7.4.3  COMPARATIVE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES
Several comparative analyses on the biological activities of extracts of the mycelium, culture broth, 
and/or fruiting bodies of a number of SFM have been reported. Findings have indicated that these 

127
7.5  Future Perspectives
extracts exhibited biological activities comparable to the sclerotium; in some cases, these are even more 
potent than the extracts prepared from the sclerotium; for instance, Zhang et al. (2004) compared the 
antitumor activities of the hot aqueous extracts of the sclerotium and mycelium of L. tuber-regium. The 
mycelial extracts (65.4%) exhibited higher inhibition ratios than those of the sclerotium (55.3%) when 
tested against sarcoma 180 solid tumor grown in Balb/c mice at a dosage of 20 mg/kg for 10 days. The 
mycelial extracts (83–65%) revealed a higher inhibition ratio against HL-60 leukemic cells than sclero-
tial extract (approximately 30%) at a concentration of 50–200 µg/mL. As for their antioxidative effects, 
the polysaccharide-enriched extracts of the mycelium and culture broth of I. obliquus demonstrated 
relatively higher antioxidant capacity than that of the natural sclerotia.
The extra- and intracellular polysaccharides showed stronger hydroxyl radical and lipid peroxida-
tion inhibitory effects, but lower DPPH quenching activity, than the sclerotial polysaccharides. Lau 
et al. (2014) compared the biological activities of the sclerotium with the mycelium and culture broth 
produced from shaken and static conditions of liquid fermentation. It was demonstrated that the aque-
ous methanol extracts of the mycelium and culture broth showed either higher or comparable anti-
oxidant capacity compared to the extract of the sclerotium. The extract of culture broth from static 
liquid fermentation showed the highest radical scavenging, reducing, metal chelating, and inhibitory 
effects on lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, the effect of the extracts on the cellular viability 
of mammalian cells was found to be comparable. The extracts were considered to be noncytotoxic 
(IC50 > 200 µg/mL, 72 h) against a panel of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines. The aqueous 
extract of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium was reported to stimulate neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells at a low 
concentration of 20 µg/mL (Eik et al., 2012).
Mycelial extracts of the same species cultured in liquid fermentation also retained their neurito-
genic properties, as demonstrated by John et al. (2013). In another study, the polysaccharide extracts 
and fractions of the sclerotium and mycelium of I. obliquus enhanced cell proliferation and stimulated 
the secretion of cytokines of human PBMC (Xu et al., 2014); again, this seemed to indicate that myce-
lial extracts might exhibit bioactivities similar to those of the sclerotium. Table 7.1 depicts the biologi-
cal activities of SFM from different developmental stages, i.e., fruiting body, sclerotium, as well as 
mycelium and culture broth from liquid fermentation. One important question is whether the observa-
tion is due to different active compounds or similar compounds in different concentrations; this remains 
unclear, and extensive chemical profiling should be carried out to ascertain this.
7.5  FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Several aspects have been identified for further research. As the medicinal properties of SFM have been 
scientifically validated, there is a need to explore the active compounds and their mechanisms of action 
to provide a better understanding. Second, cultivation of SFM should be developed so that higher yields 
are obtained and shorter amounts of time are needed for fructification and formation of sclerotium. The 
use of inducers might have an effect on the formation of sclerotium. It was mentioned that mushroom 
mycelia are “waves of the future” as these represent consistent quality. Third, there seems to be a gap 
in the current findings on the medicinal properties of SFM from different developmental stages; for 
instance, most SFM have yet to be screened for biological activities such as neurite-outgrowth stimula-
tory and antihypertensive activities.
While there is work that describes similar medicinal properties of the mycelia as compared to the 
sclerotia and fruiting bodies, this cannot be generalized for all species; for example, the diuretic activity

of P. umbellatus and W. cocos mycelial extracts has yet to be demonstrated. In another study by Zheng 
et al. (2008), it was reported that the extract of I. obliquus sclerotium exhibited two-fold higher capacity 
in inhibiting CYP-induced reduction of body weight, spleen index, and viability of peripheral lympho-
cytes than those of the culture filtrate. Since the concentration of some hispidin analogs and melanins 
was higher in the extract of sclerotium, these were postulated to contribute to the observed effect. 
Further work is needed to confirm this and to establish the relative potency of extracts and chemical 
constituents from mycelia as opposed to the sclerotia and fruiting bodies.
7.6  CONCLUSIONS
The vast amount of scientific data provides evidence that SFM are emerging sources of bioactive com-
pounds with various biological activities and that these can be potential lead structures for the develop-
ment of drugs. The possibility of cultivating SFM on a large scale through solid-substrate fermentation 
to produce sclerotia and fruiting bodies is high, as proved by the artificial cultivation of L. rhinocerotis; 
however, the length of time required makes mushroom mycelium from liquid fermentation a viable 
alternative to both native and cultivated sclerotia. The evidence presented above also reveals that myce-
lium is on par with the sclerotia in terms of chemical composition and bioactivity. This is because 
mycelium possesses all the outstanding properties of the mushrooms but in even stronger form because 
it is the substance that creates and feeds the fungal bodies; however, more research is needed to opti-
mize the yield of target compounds found in nature by controlling the time of growth to harvest, physi-
cal and chemical requirements of growth, and effects of inducers.

8.1  INTRODUCTION
In the early 1950s, the agrochemical industry provided agriculture with a vast array of chemicals for 
crop protection, including virucides, fungicides, bactericides, insecticides, and nematocides. Pathogenic 
organisms are mainly controlled chemically; however, the use of synthetic compounds is limited due to 
several undesirable aspects, such as carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, acute toxicity, and the requirement 
of an extended degradation period with consequent development of environmental pollution problems 
(Sokovic´ et al., 2013). The new awareness of modern consumers about these problems has created 
a “green” consumer profile that demands the removal of synthetic chemicals from food production 
and preservation, together with extended shelf life for the majority of food products. Altogether, this 
demand forces the scientific community and agroindustrial and pharmaceutical companies to search 
for natural compounds that will satisfy the consumer (Harvey, 2008). Furthermore, there is growing 
concern about chemical protection because of their undesirable side effects in humans and other target 
organisms, and their behavior and fate in the environment (Jespers, 1994). Recently, interest has been 
growing in natural products derived from mushrooms due to their availability, fewer side effects, and 
lower toxicity as well as better biodegradability, which is important in the agricultural industry.
The number of mushroom species on Earth is currently estimated at 140,000, yet perhaps only 
10% (approximately 14,000 named species) are known to science; 2000 of these are safe for human 
consumption, and about 660 possess medicinal properties. In the second half of the twentieth cen-
tury, mushroom-producing technologies have grown enormously, and the value of world mushroom 
production in 2011 was estimated to be worth about US$60 billion. Many pharmaceutical substances 
with potent and unique properties have recently been extracted from mushrooms. In particular, and 
most importantly for modern medicine, medicinal mushrooms contain an unlimited source of poly-
saccharides and polysaccharide–protein complexes with anticancer and immunostimulating proper-
ties. Many, if not all, higher Basidiomycetes mushrooms contain biologically active polysaccharides 
in their fruit bodies, cultured mycelia, and cultured broth. The data on mushroom polysaccharides 
today have been summarized for 660 species and intraspecific taxa from 182 higher Hetero- and 
Homobasidiomycetes.

138
Chapter 8  MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS
Numerous excellent scientific investigations and review articles have been published on the subject 
of biologically active secondary metabolites from higher Basidiomycetes (Anke, 1989; Lorenzen and 
Anke, 1998; Wasser and Weis, 1999a,b; Wasser, 2002; Brandt and Piraino, 2000; Reshetnikov et al., 
2001; Abraham, 2001; Zjawiony, 2004; Rai et al., 2005; Robles-Hernández et al., 2008, Barros et al., 
2007; Fagade and Oyelade, 2009, Hearst et al., 2009; Beattie et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2010; Saddiqe 
et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Chang and Wasser, 2012; Younis et al., 
2015). These investigations have focused exclusively on higher Basidiomycetes, which are considered 
by many authors to be a major source of pharmacologically active natural products. According to 
Sokovic´ et al. (2013), from higher Basidiomycetes—exemplified by species of the genera Ganoderma, 
Lactarius, or Agaricus—about 2000 active compounds have been derived.
Medicinal mushrooms offer an advantage in that their active components are safe for humans. Many 
compounds such as β-D-glucans, heteropolysaccharides, glycoproteins, lectins, and terpenoids inhibit 
tumor cells and have not shown negative effects on treated patients. The antimicrobial properties of 
certain Basidiomycetes provide human and plant pathogen control that is generally safe and effective. 
Several species of Basidiomycetes mushrooms have demonstrated antibacterial activity against human 
pathogens; others have shown antifungal activity against both human and plant pathogens, while others 
have inhibited phytopathogenic nematodes.
In this context, systematic screening of secondary metabolites of higher Basidiomycetes may result 
in the discovery of novel and unique sets of compounds with the potential to address agricultural and 
medicinal challenges.
This paper gives an overview on the activity of mushroom compounds as well as their chemical 
composition and potential uses.
8.2  ANTIBACTERIAL METABOLITES
There are numerous publications describing the antibacterial properties of secondary metabolites iso-
lated from various higher Basidiomycetes (Barros et al., 2007; Fagade and Oyelade, 2009, Hearst 
et al., 2009; Beattie et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2010; Saddiqe et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; 
Wang et al., 2012). The antibacterial activity of some Basidiomycetes mushrooms provides efficient 
and low-cost methods for human and plant disease control. The highest antibacterial activity occurred 
among members of the Ganodermatales, Poriales, Agaricales, and Stereales, and these may constitute 
a good source for developing new antibiotics. But the effect of Basidiomycetes secondary metabolites 
has been investigated mainly on human and animal disease pathogens. Unfortunately, the publications 
describing antibacterial properties of isolated secondary metabolites of mushrooms on plant bacteria 
models are very limited. Despite this, several interesting publications have shown the potential of 
Basidiomycetes as valuable producers of substances that can be used successfully in the agricultural 
sector.
Two Basidiomycete mushrooms, Ganoderma lucidum and Laetiporus sulphureus, showed strong 
antibacterial activity against Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Erwinia caroto-
vora subsp. carotovora, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, and Xanthomonas campestris pv. camp-
estris (Robles-Hernández, 2004).
Extracts from Clytocybe geotropa have shown the broadest range of inhibition against Ralstonia 
solanacearum, E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, P. syringae pv. syringae, X. campestris pv. vesicatoria,

and Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus. Purified protein, clitocypin from C. geotropa, 
showed inhibition against C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus when tested on agar plates (Dreo et al., 
2007).
Coprinol, isolated from culture fluids of Coprinus spp., shows antibacterial activity against most of 
the plant pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria in vitro (Johansson et al., 2001).
The fungicide strobilurin F 500 enhances resistance of tobacco to the wild fire pathogen 
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. The mechanism of action of strobilurin F 500 is by inducing cel-
lular responses to the pathogen attack. It induces the production of endogenous salicylic acid and 
pathogenesis-related proteins that usually are used as molecular markers for disease resistance (Herms 
et al., 2002).
8.3  ANTIFUNGAL AND HERBICIDAL METABOLITES
Naturally occurring substances found in medicinal mushrooms have revealed important sources of mol-
ecules with antifungal properties. For example, the secondary metabolites strobilurin (Table 8.1, N1) 
and oudemansin (Table 8.1, N6), isolated from mycelia of the Basidiomycete fungi Strobilurus tenacel-
lus (Anke and Oberwinkler, 1977) and Oudemansiella mucida (Musilek et al., 1969), showed high anti-
fungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi at very low concentrations (Lorenzen and Anke, 1998). 
They have a unique mode of action, selectively inhibiting the respiration of fungi by interfering with the 
ubiquinol oxidation center of the mitochondrial bc1 complex (Lorenzen and Anke, 1998). Oudemansin 
X (Table 8.1, N8) was isolated from Oudemansiella radicata, and showed high fungicidal and bacteri-
cidal activities against many plant pathogens (Anke et al., 1990). The chlorinated strobilurins B (Table 
8.1, N7) are also isolated from Mycena alkalina, Mycena avenacea, Mycena crocata, Xerula longipes, 
and Xerula melanotricha. Basidiocarps of the genera Agaricus, Favolaschia, and Filoboletus produced 
strobilurins A (Table 8.1, N1), E (Table 8.1, N3), and F1 (Table 8.1, N4), 9-methoxystrobilurins A 
(Table 8.1, N5), and oudemansin A (Table 8.1, N6) (Zjawiony, 2004). According to Clough (1993), 
the strobirulin E and oudemansins also were isolated from the Basidiomycetes fungus Crepidotus ful-
votomentosus. These compounds have served as natural product prototypes for the design of synthetic 
analogs Azoxystrobin (ICI5504) and kresoxim-methyl (BAS490F), which were sold for the first time 
in 1996 (Knight et al., 1997). Their lack of mammalian toxicity has made them good lead compounds 
for the development of commercial agricultural fungicides.
Very similar aromatic compounds, such as anisaldehyde (Table 8.1, N9) and (4-methoxyphe-
nyl)-1,2–propanediol (Table 8.1, N10), showing weak antifungal activity, were isolated from Pleurotus 
pulmonarius and Bjerkandera adusta (De Jong et al., 1994).
Another fungal metabolite, favolon (Table 8.1, N11), produced from a culture of an Ethiopian 
Favolaschia species, is an unusual ergosterone with a B/C-cis ring junction. This compound displayed 
strong antifungal activity against numerous fungal pathogens, with the strongest inhibitions in the 
agar diffusion assay for Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces varioti, and Penicillium islandicum (Anke et al., 
1995). According to Aqueveque et al. (2005) the new biologically active triterpenoid favolon B (Table 
8.1, N12), isolated from fermentation broth of Mycena spp., showed antifungal activity toward Botrytis 
cinerea, M. miehei, P. variotii, and Penicillium notatum.
A potent fungicidal N-hydroxylated maleimide derivative, himanimide C (Table 8.1, N14), was 
isolated from Basidiomycete Serpula himantoides (Aqueveque et al., 2002). Himanimide C exhibited

Chapter 8  MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS
fungicidal effects, especially against Alternaria porri, Aspergillus ochraceus, and Pythium irregu-
lar from a concentration of 25 µg/mL. Fungistatic effects were observed against Absidia glauca, 
Cladosporium cladosporiodes, Curvularia lunata, Zygorhynchus moelleri, Nadsonia fulvescens, and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Himanimide B (Table 8.1, N13) exhibited a weak inhibition of root forma-
tion of Lepidium sativum at the concentration of 100 µg/disc.
The antifungal isocumarin oospolactone (Table 8.1, N15) was identified as a secondary metabolite 
of Gleophyllum sepiarium (Nakajima et al., 1976). This compound was most active against strains of 
the asexual ascomycete Alternaria, showing MIC values of 12.5–25 µg/mL.
Hypnophilin (Table 8.1, N14), together with pleurotellol (Table 8.1, N17), was isolated from fer-
mentation of the agaricoid Basidiomycete Pleurotellus hypnophillus (Kupka et al., 1981). Hypnophilin 
and pleurotellol both act as plant growth inhibitors.
The antifungal sesterterpene β-D-xyloside aleurodiscal (Table 8.1, N18) was isolated from the 
wood-rotting polypore Aleurodiscus mirabilis (Lauer et al., 1989). Aleurodiscal is selectively active 
against Zygomycetes, especially against M. miehei.
An interesting acetylenic compound exhibiting antifungal activity is 1-hydroxy-2-nonyn-3-one 
(Table 8.1, N19), isolated from the biomass after fermentation of the polypore Ischnoderma benzoinum 
(Lorenzen and Anke, 1998).
The cultivation of Clitocybe claviceps led to the isolation of three metabolites with pronounced 
antifungal activities, the clavilactones A, B, and C (Table 8.1, N20). In addition to its antifungal activi-
ties, clavilactone B exhibits antibacterial and herbicidal effects (Arnone et al., 1994).
Agrocybin (Table 8.1, N21) was isolated from Marasmius oreades. This metabolite, previously 
isolated from Agrocybe dura, is suggested to be the principal herbicide responsible for the killing of 
grass caused by the fairy ring mushroom M. oreades (Ayer and Craw, 1989).
A new chlorinated phthalide, 7-chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-1(3H)-isobenzofuranon (Table 8.1, N22), 
was isolated from Leucoagaricus carneifolia (Lorenzen and Anke, 1998), which exhibited selective 
activity against Botrytis cinerea.
The melleolides (Table 8.1, N23) B, C, and D are the first terpenoid orsellinates isolated from 
Armillaria mellea. Elsewhere in nature, many esters of orsellinic acid have been isolated from lichens 
or their mycobionts. The melleolides exhibited activity against the fungus Cladosporium cucumerinum 
(Lorenzen and Anke, 1998).
Omphalodin (Table 8.1, N24) containing a succinic acid anhydride element was isolated from 
Lentinellus spp. This herbicidal compound delayed the germination and reduced the growth of  
L. sativum by 80% at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. Weak antifungal activity against Naematospora 
coryli was observed (Stärk et al., 1991).
1-Sterpurene, together with sterpuric acid, sterepolide, and dihydrosterepolide (Table 8.1, N25), 
was isolated from Stereum purpureum (Ayer and Saeedi-Ghomi, 1981). Sterpuric acid was reported 
to possess phytotoxic properties and is thought to be the causative agent of silver leaf disease in many 
fruit and ornamental trees (Ayer et al., 1984).
Phlebiakauranol, an ent-kaurane, was first described as a metabolite from Phlebia strigoso-
zonata. Phlebiakauranol aldehyde (Table 8.1, N26) was derived by heating phlebiakauranol. 
Phlebiakauranol aldehyde exhibited strong antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. In greenhouse 
trials with Phytophtora infestans on tomatoes and Plasmopara viticola of grapevines, positive pro-
tective effects were obtained (Lorenzen and Anke, 1998).

8.4  Antiviral Metabolites
The methanol extract of Laetiporus sulphureus indicated complete inhibition of Aspergillus fla-
vus growth in tomato paste for 15 days. An inhibition rate of 99.83% was achieved with 0.15 µg/
mL of extract. Complete fungicide activity (100%) and no spore survival in the tomato product was 
recorded using 0.25 µg/mL of L. sulphureus extract in tomato medium. Since L. sulphureus is widely 
consumed as an edible mushroom, its use as a natural preservative in tomato paste can be considered 
safe (Stojković et al., 2011).
The initial transformation product of pyrene metabolization by Crinipellis stipitaria, 1-hydroxypyr-
ene (Table 8.1, N27), showed significant antifungal activity. Growth of most fungi was inhibited at 5 to 
25 µg/mL (Lambert et al., 1995).
8.4  ANTIVIRAL METABOLITES
Brandt and Piraino divided the antiviral compounds from fungi into two major classes: (i) those that 
act indirectly as biological response modifiers (usually from polysaccharide fractions) and (ii) those 
that act directly as viral inhibitors (Brandt and Piraino, 2000). In higher Basidiomycetes, especially 
polypores, several polysaccharide fractions display direct inhibitory effects on various viruses. Most 
commonly, the effect of Basidiomycete polysaccharides has been investigated using only human and 
animal virus models (Gao et al., 1996, 2004). The influence of Basidiomycete metabolites on plant 
pathogenic viruses compared with human and animal pathogens has been poorly studied. Only a few 
articles on anthiphytoviral activities of higher Basidiomycetes have been published.
A pink quinone, tentatively identified as β-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone, present in sporo-
phores of Agaricus bisporus is a potent systemic inhibitor of plant virus infections (Tavantzis and 
Smith, 1982). A high level of resistance (98.5% or 81.5% reduction in members of lesions) has been 
observed when cowpea or pinto beans were mechanically inoculated with tobacco ringspot virus 
(TRSV) or tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).
Aqueous extracts from Agaricus brasiliensis and Lentinula edodes fruiting bodies showed antiviral 
activity against infection of passionflower with cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (Di Piero et al., 2010).
The filtrate from cultured biomass of the polypore Fomes fomentarius, “tinder conk,” is highly 
active against the mechanical transmission of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), with an IC50 value of 10 µg/
mL, and it has similar effects against TMV infection on bell pepper and tomato plants (Lorenzen and 
Anke, 1998).
The screening of G. lucidum and Ganoderma applanatum strains for antiviral properties of their 
metabolites has shown that all of them were able to inhibit TMV development. The activity of prepara-
tions increased with the increase of concentration. Ganoderma lucidum and G. applanatum at a con-
centration of 1000 µg/mL inhibited viral infection to 65–70% (Kovalenko et al., 2008).
A new lectin, named AAL, has been purified from the fruiting bodies of the edible mushroom 
Agrocybe aegerita (Sun et al., 2003). It showed inhibition activity to infection of TMV on Nicotiana 
glutinosa. The result of IEF suggested that AAL attached to TMV particles.
According to their chemical properties, two types of polysaccharides, neutral and acid polysaccha-
rides, have been isolated from the culture liquid and fruit bodies of higher Basidiomycetes. In par-
ticular, the acid polysaccharide of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) (Table 8.1, N28), produced by 
Tremella mesenterica, consists of a linear backbone of β-(1→2)(1→4)-linked oligosaccharides of xylose 

148
Chapter 8  MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS
and glucuronic acid, which produces the polyanion properties (Kakuta et al., 1979; Kovalenko, 1993; 
Vinogradov et al., 2004). According to Kovalenko et al. (2009), the neutral and acid polysaccharides 
have different characteristics of antiphytoviral activity. Neutral polysaccharides inhibited the develop-
ment of local lesions induced by TMV on Datura plants by 80% and 99.4% (in concentrations of 100–
1000 µg/mL). GXM was considerably less active, and, in this case, the total preparation occupied an 
intermediate position, revealing evidence that the total preparation activity relative to the infectivity of 
TMV is induced to a greater extent by neutral polysaccharides (Kovalenko et al., 2009).
8.5  INSECTICIDAL AND NEMATOCIDAL METABOLITES
Fruiting bodies and mycelium of Basidiomycete species, such as those belonging to the genera Lepista, 
Clitocybe, and Cantharellus, are never inhabited by insects. Extracts from numerous mushroom fruit-
ing bodies have been demonstrated to possess insecticidal properties, and several of these fungi are 
edible, which makes them valuable sources of new candidate insecticides. The insecticidal properties 
of these mushrooms were attributed to proteins such as lectins or hemolysins (Meir et al., 1996; Wang 
et al., 2002). The first protein isolated from a Basidiomycete mushroom showing insecticidal activity 
was a lectin from the red cracking bolete (Xerocomus chrysenteron), named lectin XCL, which is the 
third known member of the new saline-soluble lectin family present in fungi (Triguéros et al., 2003). 
This protein, purified from mushrooms, was found to be toxic to some insects, such as the dipteran 
Drosophila melanogaster and the hemipteran Acyrthosiphon pisum.
Several species of Lactarius (Russulaceae) contain sescuiterpene lactones (Table 8.1, N29) that 
deter insects from feeding (Nawrot et al., 1986). The European Lactarius fuliginosus contains a variety 
of chromenes (Conca et al., 1981; Allievi et al., 1983). Chromenes are toxic to various Lepidoptera  
species or cause anti-hormone effects that induce a precocious metamorphosis (Bowers, 1976). Extracts 
of L. fuliginosus and L. fumosus var. fumosus showed the strongest toxic effects against the large  
milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, and in some cases caused precocious development (Dowd and 
Miller, 1990).
Glucose-, galactose-, sucrose-, lactose-, and sepharose-binding lectines have been isolated from 
fruiting bodies of Clytocybe nebularis (Pohleven et  al., 2011). Sucrose-binding lectin showed the 
strongest activity against D. melanogaster, followed by lactose- and galactose-binding lectins. A feed-
ing bioassay with the Colorado potato beetle revealed that C. nebularis extract exhibited high antinutri-
tional activity against the insect; of those tested, only lactose-binding lectin, named CNL, showed the 
effect. C. nebularis lectines could thus have potential use as natural insecticides.
The nucleoside antibiotic clitocine (Table 8.1, N30) was isolated from C. inversa as an insecticidal 
compound (Kubo et al., 1986).
According to Bücker et al. (2013), crude extracts from the Basidiomycete Pycnoporus sanguineus 
have high larvicidal activity against the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Anopheles nuneztovari, and have 
potential for the production of bioactive substances against larvae of these two tropical disease vectors, 
with An. nuneztovari being more susceptible to the extracts.
According to Chelela et al. (2014), the Lactarius gymnocarpoides crude ethanol extract exhibited 
the highest larvicidal activity against the mosquito A. aegypti, with an LC50 of 10.75 µg/mL after 72 h 
of exposure. L. densifolius chloroform extract was effective against Anopheles gambiae (LC50 = 91.33  
µg/mL) and moderately effective against Culex quinquefasciatus (LC50 = 181.16 µg/mL), respectively.

149
8.6  Conclusions
Anisaldehyde (Table 8.1, N31), 3-chloro-anisaldehyde, and (4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2-propandiol 
were isolated from fungal fermentation products and from natural substances of several common wood 
and forest-litter degrading fungi, e.g., P. pulmonarius, B. adusta, Hypholoma fasciculare, and Pholiota 
squarrosa (Stadler et al., 1994; De Jong et al., 1994). For p-anisaldehyde and (4-methoxyphenyl)-
1,2-propandiol, weak antifungal and nematocidal properties have been described. Fatty acids, e.g., 
S-coriolic acid or linoleic acid (Table 8.1, N32), isolated from P. pulmonarius exhibit nematocidal 
effects against the saprophytic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, with LD50 values of 10 and 5 µg/mL, 
respectively (Stadler et al., 1994). These effects depend on the degree of unsaturation, the position of 
the double bonds, and the length of the fatty acid (Lorenzen and Anke, 1998). Also, 1,2-dihydroxy-
mintlactone (Table 8.1, N33), a nematocidal monoterpene, was isolated from the wood-inhabiting 
Basidiomycete Cheimonophyllum candidissimum (Stadler et al., 1995). The LD50 toward the sapro-
phytic nematode C. elegans was 25 µg/mL, and herbicidal effects against Setaria italic and L. sativum 
were detected at concentrations starting from 50 µg/mL (Lorenzen and Anke, 1998). Six new bisab-
olane type sesquiterpenes, the cheimonophyllons and cheimonophyllal, were isolated from the wood-
inhabiting mushroom Ch. candissimum. These sesquiterpenes exhibit nematocidal activities against 
nematode C. elegans, with LD50 values of 10–25 µg/mL (Lorenzen and Anke, 1998).
The furaldehydes 5-pentyl-2-furaldehyde and 5(4-penteny)-2-furaldehyde (Table 8.1, N34) were 
isolated from Irpex lacteus. They exhibited nematocidal activity against Aphelencoides besseyi, with 
IC50 values of 25–50 µg/mL (Hayashi et al., 1981).
A nematocidal cyclic peptide, omphalotin (Table 8.1, N35), was isolated from biomass after 
fermentation of Omphalotus olearius (Mayer et  al., 1997). The LD50 against the plant-pathogenic 
nematode Meloidogyne incognita was determined at 0.75 µg/mL, while only weak effects against the 
saprophytic nematode C. elegans were detectable (LD50 25 µg/mL). Omphalotin is a promising candi-
date for the development of an agricultural nematocide.
1-Hydroxypyrene (Table 8.1, N27), derived from C. stipitaria, showed very strong nematocidal 
activity against the saprotrophic soil-inhabiting nematode C. elegans. The effects of 1-hydroxypyrene 
were visible after 1 h, with immobilization of nematodes by 1 mg/mL (Lambert et al., 1995).
The cultural filtrates from Amauroderma macer, Laccaria tortilis, Peziza spp., O. mucida, Pleurotus 
pulmatus, and Tylopilus striatulus showed high nematocidal activity against the pine wood nematode 
Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, with over 80% pathogenicity within 72 h of exposure being observed 
(Dong et al., 2006).
8.6  CONCLUSIONS
Deadly chemical pesticides have been the go-to fix for the conventional agricultural industry, but new 
research suggests that biopesticides made from fungi could be a safer, more planet-friendly alternative.
The present review focuses on isolated biologically active compounds of mushrooms from all over 
the world and their potential as sources of biopesticides. This information certainly will be useful for 
future scientific studies. Natural product-based virucides, fungicides, bactericides, insecticides, and 
nematicides are generally considered safer than synthetic products because of their relatively short 
environmental half-life and lack of harmful effects. Many if not all bioactive metabolites presented 
may lead to the discovery of novel target sites or to new classes of chemicals that can be developed for 
pathogen management.

Chapter 8  MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS
The advantage of biopesticides compared with synthetic ones is not only their nontoxic character-
istics but also the low cost for their production. Growing culinary-medicinal mushrooms is well estab-
lished and, in most cases, economically justified. Identification and isolation of active compounds from 
mushrooms has been clearly elaborated. Mushroom-derived biopesticides usually operate at very small 
concentrations, and for further application only small amounts are needed. Most importantly, mush-
room-derived biopesticides are relatively cheap and are available as biocontrol agents.
The data available from the literature clearly demonstrate that culinary-medicinal mushrooms 
and their metabolites present great potential for developing biopesticides. Future studies of bioac-
tive compounds and synergistic combinations from mushrooms may further the development of viru-
cides, fungicides, bactericides, insecticides, and nematicides, as well as applications for food and crop 
management.

9.1  INTRODUCTION
According to Wasser (2002), the number of mushrooms on Earth is estimated at 140,000, yet perhaps 
only 10% of species are known and named. Basidiomycete mushrooms comprise a vast but largely 
untapped source of new pharmaceutical products in the fruit bodies, cultured mycelium, and culture 
broth. They are of varying chemical composition, such as polysaccharides, glycopeptide–protein com-
plexes, proteoglycans, proteins, and triterpenoids, with most scientific attention focused on the group 
of noncellulosic β-glucans with β-(1–3) linkages in the main chain of the glucan, and additional β-(1–6) 
branch points, which are characteristic for antitumor and immunostimulating action.
Mushroom polysaccharides do not attack cancer cells directly, but produce their antitumor effects 
by activating various immune responses in the host. Structurally different β-glucans have different 
affinities toward receptors and thus generate different host responses (Chen and Seviour, 2007).
Immunomodulating and antitumor activities of these metabolites are related to immune cells such 
as hematopoietic stem cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer 
cells, which are involved in the innate and adaptive immunity, resulting in the production of biologic 
response modifiers.
The clinical evidence for antitumor and other medicinal activities comes primarily from some com-
mercialized purified polysaccharides, such as lentinan from Lentinula edodes, krestin from Coriolus 
versicolor, grifolan from Grifola frondosa, and schizophyllan from Schizophyllum commune (Wasser, 
2002; Chen and Seviour, 2007), but polysaccharide preparations of some other medicinal mushrooms 
in bioreactors represent an interesting direction in comprehensive biotechnology for the near future.
9.2  CULTIVATION TECHNOLOGIES
9.2.1  OVERVIEW OF CULTIVATION TECHNOLOGIES
Since medicinal mushrooms are scarce in nature, cultivation of these fungal species on artificial media 
has been introduced. The traditional cultivation of mushrooms on wood logs has been known for cen-
turies. Over time, cultivation methods have been diversified, modified, and developed. In addition to 

156
Chapter 9  Cultivation of Medicinal Fungi in Bioreactors
wood logs, fruit bodies are being produced on sawdust substrates in trays or beds, and in sterilized 
plastic bags or in bottles. In addition, production of fungal mycelia has been developed in bioreactors, 
utilizing submerged cultivation technologies in liquid media or solid-state substrates (Wasser, 2002).
9.2.2  PRODUCTION OF BIOMASS IN BIOREACTORS
The traditional cultivation of mushrooms to get their fruit bodies takes several months, and it is difficult 
to control the quality of products. In order to decrease cultivation time and to improve the quality, con-
trolled cultivation in bioreactors has been developed, using both submerged and solid-state processes. 
Cultivation of pharmaceutically active biomass of higher fungi in bioreactors with optimized substrate 
compositions and controlled process parameters enables a shorter cultivation time and large-scale pro-
duction under full process control. Two main aerobic technologies are used—submerged cultivation, in 
a liquid medium, and solid-state substrate bioprocessing. Compared the traditional farming production 
to get fungal fruit bodies, which requires months for cultivation, submerged and solid-state bioprocess-
ing (SSB) produce greater amounts of fungal mycelia and pharmaceutically active products in a much 
shorter time.
The submerged cultivation of fungal biomass takes place in aerobic conditions in liquid media. 
Although far from the natural environment of higher fungi, this technology enables fast and large-scale 
production of fungal mycelia and its extracellular (EPS) and intracellular (IPS) polysaccharides, pro-
tein–glucans, sterols, steroids, and other compounds in 2–3 weeks. Large amounts of fungal biomass 
and metabolites can be produced, suitable for human consumption. Solid-state cultivation in bioreac-
tors enables the production of medicinal fungi on various secondary raw material sources, obtained 
from wood, agriculture, and food industry wastes. The final product is a delignified solid substrate, 
overgrown with fungal mycelia, enriched with protein-rich biomass, with immobilized pharmaceuti-
cally active compounds. This type of cultivation is suitable primarily for veterinary uses. Drying, pul-
verization, and pelletization of pulverized material enable the inexpensive production of animal feed 
for ruminants.
9.2.3  SUBMERGED BIOPROCESSING
Submerged bioprocessing represents a method of liquid-state cultivation with the introduction of inlet 
air as a source of oxygen for aerobic processes. The bioreactors for submerged cultivation are based on 
various mixing principles, with various kinds of radial or axial agitators, pneumatic mixing systems, or 
circulation pumps. Usually, the production size of bioreactors ranges from 50 to 400 m3, and they are 
fully equipped with comprehensive instrumental control. The cultivation of liquid substrate inside the 
bioreactor is either batch or continuous. In submerged cultivation the consistency of the substrate and 
secretion of fungal polysaccharides influence the formation of pseudoplastic bioprocess in broth rheol-
ogy, and consequently limit transport processes, namely oxygen and heat transfer.
In recent decades, submerged cultivation has become a promising alternative for efficient produc-
tion of valuable mushroom metabolites, such as fungal polysaccharides. The influence of agitation 
rate and the shearing action of impellers on the morphology and productivity of filamentous fungi has 
received considerable scientific attention. There seems to be an inverse relationship between agita-
tion intensity and pellet size. Vigorous agitation appears to prevent pellet formation, while elevated 
agitation results in small and compact pellets. The outstanding problems in submerged production of 

157
9.3  Cultivation of Medicinal Mushrooms in Bioreactors
medicinal mushroom biomass in bioreactors are: (i) intensive growth on fungal biomass on the bio-
reactor head space, sensors, and bioreactor wall; (ii) secretion of fungal polysaccharides changes the 
cultivation liquid rheology; (iii) changes of mass and heat transfers (Berovic et al., 2003).
9.2.4  SOLID-STATE BIOPROCESSING
SSB involves the growth of microorganisms or fungi in beds of moist solid materials, in which the 
interparticle spaces contain a continuous gas phase and little or no free water. The main sources of 
water, carbohydrates, phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur are intrapartically bounded; therefore, the cul-
ture applied must possess the ability to access water and essential element sources in the solid matrix. 
Heat removal is a major design consideration for SSB bioreactors, both static and mixed. Internal and 
external heat exchangers have been incorporated in many bioreactor designs, including packed beds 
and bioreactors that provide agitation during bioprocessing. Since the late 1970s, there has been inter-
est in using SSB to produce various bioproducts, such as enzymes, organic acids, and antibiotics.
A major difference between submerged cultivation and solid-state cultivation is thus the amount 
of free liquid in the substrate. In submerged cultivation, the amount of dissolved solids rarely exceeds 
5–10%, whereas in solid-state cultivation the solids typically represent between 20% and 70% of the 
total substrate mass. The water activity (aw) of substrates is an important aspect of fungal cultivation, 
because the growth of fungi is controlled by the level of aw. This means that the water activity of the 
substrate determines the lower limit of available water for fungal growth (Mitchell and Berovic, 2014).
9.3  CULTIVATION OF MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS IN BIOREACTORS
Almost unknown in Western scientific research, some of the wood-degrading Basidiomycetes have been 
intensely and systematically studied in bioreactors due to their promising pharmacological effects (Wasser, 
2002). Medicinal mushrooms of greatest interest, cultivated in various kinds of bioreactors, have been 
Ganoderma lucidum, G. frondosa, Trametes versicolor, Hericium erinaceus, and Cordyceps militaris.
9.3.1  SUBMERGED CULTIVATION OF G. LUCIDUM
Recently, submerged cultivation technology for mycelial cultures of G. lucidum has been developed, 
and has attracted much attention as a promising cultivation alternative (Berovic et al., 2003). In com-
mercial applications, most market products emphasize both the amount of fungal mycelium and dose 
of polysaccharides. Therefore, an efficient cultivation process combines the production of cellular bio-
materials and released EPS. Optimization of substrate composition and cultivation conditions is vital 
for enhancing production efficiency in a submerged culture.
Cultivation parameters, including inoculation density (Fang et al., 2002), pH (Fang et al., 2002a), 
temperature, mixing intensity (Yang and Liau, 1998), and medium composition (Yang et al., 2000; 
Fang and Zhong, 2002b), have been reported to affect the efficiency of cultivation of G. lucidum. 
However, few investigations have taken into consideration the optimization of cultivation conditions 
while simultaneously studying interactions among various operational factors, especially when both 
mycelium and polysaccharides were produced. Chang et al. (2006) applied the Taguchi experimental 
design to optimize the medium composition for submerged culture of G. lucidum.

Chapter 9  Cultivation of Medicinal Fungi in Bioreactors
9.3.1.1  Inoculum preparation
There are two main strategies for the preparation of mycelial inocula in submerged cultivation: either 
preparation of the seed culture on agar, or preparation by submerged cultivation. Zore et al. (1998) 
used the inocula of 120 h shaken vegetative cultures grown on a substrate consisting of potato dextrose, 
20 g/L of glucose, and 2% (v/v) of olive oil at pH 5.8. A stirred tank bioreactor (STB) was inoculated 
at 30°C with 17% (v/v) of the vegetative inoculum. Cultivation lasted 160 h, the concentration of dis-
solved oxygen was maintained by aeration at 10 L/min, and the mixing speed was 400 rpm. Minimal 
oxygen partial pressure was 30% (v/v) at pH 4.2.
Simonic et al. (2008) inoculated the bioreactor with 5.0% (v/v) of the homogenized seed culture, 
and cultivated it at 30°C and initial pH of 4. The optimum inoculum density for biomass and polysac-
charide production in the case of G. lucidum HAI 447 was 40%. These results were different from the 
results of Berovic et al. (2003), using strain G. lucidum MZKI, which showed that 17% of inoculum 
was the most suitable. Using 14% inoculum was not sufficient to support growth intensively, due to the 
low production of EPS activators and growth factors. An inoculum of 20% concentration was too high, 
inducing competition in substrate consumption. Fang et al. (2002b) and Fang et al. (2002) obtained at 
an inoculation density of 330 mg dry weight/L a maximal cell concentration of 15.7 g dry cell weight/L. 
Within an inoculation density range of 70–670 mg dry weight/L, a larger inoculation density led to 
small pellet size and high production of EPS and IPS, while a relatively large pellet size and high accu-
mulation of ganoderic acids were observed at a low inoculation density. The conclusion was that small 
pellet size resulted in high polysaccharide production, while large pellet size led to high production of 
ganoderic acids. Similar results were reported by Hsieh et al. (2006b).
9.3.1.2  The effect of medium initial pH
A medium initial pH can greatly affect cell membrane function, cell growth, morphology and structure, 
salt solubility, the ionic state of substrates, uptake of various nutrients, and product biosynthesis. Yang 
and Liau (1998) found that pH values from 4.0 to 4.5 in a glucose-NH4Cl medium in a range were opti-
mal for G. lucidum production of EPS (1.6 mg/mL); with decreasing pH, the amount of EPS declined. 
Lee et al. (1999) reported that pH control affected G. lucidum mycelial growth and exopolysaccharide 
production. Bistage pH control retained the desirable morphologies of the mycelia during cultivation, 
and resulted in low viscosity of the culture broth.
Fang and Zhong (2002a) investigated the effects of initial pH of 3.5–7.0 on production of G. luci-
dum polysaccharides and ganoderic acids. The initial pH value had a significant effect on the cell 
growth and product biosynthesis. At a pH of 6.5, a biomass of 17.3 ± 0.12 g/L was obtained, and the 
production of ganoderic acid was 1.20 ± 0.03 mg. Gradually lowering the initial pH from 6.5 to 3.5 led 
to higher production of EPS and IPS. In G. lucidum CCRC36021 cultivation in a medium composed 
of thin stillage and wastewater resulting from the rice wine production, the lowest level of biomass and 
exopolysaccharide production was at pH 4.0, and the highest at pH 5.0 (7.8 and 7.5 g/L); with further 
pH increase, the yields decreased (Hsieh et al., 2005). Hsieh et al. (2006a,b) reported that exopolysac-
charide and specific IPS production increased with a decrease in the initial medium pH. This can be 
explained by the fact that cells continuously metabolized the carbon source and secreted various gano-
deric and lucidenic acids in the medium during the first few days of cultivation (Berovic et al., 2003; 
Hsieh et al., 2005). Using a liquid substrate based on whey permeate, optimum mycelial growth was 
observed at pH 4.4 and cultivation temperature of 30°C (Song et al., 2007).

9.3  Cultivation of Medicinal Mushrooms in Bioreactors
9.3.1.3  The influence of aeration and agitation
The oxygen in a liquid substrate affects cell growth, cellular morphology, nutrient uptake, and metabo-
lite biosynthesis, while agitation and aeration have a great influence on biomass and polysaccharide 
production, particularly EPS (Yang and Liau, 1998; Tang and Zhong, 2003). Stationary conditions 
seem to be more suitable for IPS production (Simonic et al., 2008). According to Yang and Liau (1998), 
while higher agitation speeds enhanced mixing efficiency and polysaccharide release, the higher shear 
stress had a detrimental effect on mycelial growth and polysaccharide formation. Tang and Zhong 
(2003) reported on the effects of oxygen supply on submerged cultivation of G. lucidum in a 3.5-L 
bioreactor with two six-bladed turbine impellers for agitation. An initial volumetric oxygen transfer 
coefficient (kLa) value within the range of 16.4–96.0/h had a significant effect on cell growth, cellular 
morphology, and metabolite biosynthesis. An increase in the initial coefficient led to a larger size of 
mycelia aggregates and a higher production of ganoderic acids. Mycelial growth was significantly 
inhibited when dissolved oxygen tension was about 10% of air saturation. Hsieh et al. (2006b) observed 
optimum polysaccharide production under conditions of sufficient oxygen during the first few days of 
cultivation. Zhang and Zhong (2010) studied the effects of oxygen concentration of 21–100% in gase-
ous phase on the morphology and ganoderic acid production by G. lucidum in liquid stationary culture. 
A higher oxygen concentration increased individual ganoderic acid production, and more spores and 
higher total ganoderic acid content were obtained at an oxygen level of 80%.
9.3.1.4  The influence of substrate composition
The substrate compositions for submerged cultivation of G. lucidum mycelia differ from author to 
author. For instance, an optimized medium for a shake-flask submerged culture of G. lucidum, as 
reported by Chang et al. (2006), consisted of 1.88 g/L CaCO3, 71.4 g/L brown sugar, 12.1 g/L malt 
extract, 2.28 g/L yeast extract, 18.4 g/L skim milk, 3.44 g/L safflower seed oil, and 3.96 g/L olive oil, 
at pH 6.5. Compared to an unoptimized substrate, mycelium formation was markedly improved, from 
1.70 to 18.70 g/L, and polysaccharide production increased from 0.140 to 0.420 g/L. Yang and Liau 
(1998) studied the influence of cultivation parameters on polysaccharide formation by G. lucidum 
in submerged cultures. The substrate consisted of 50 g/L glucose, 0.5 g/L K2HPO4, 0.5 g/L KH2PO4, 
0.5 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g/L yeast extract, and 4 g/L ammonium chloride. Optimal temperature was 
30–35°C and the pH was 4–4.5. Tang and Zhong (2003) used a medium consisting of 35 g/L lactose, 
5 g/L peptone, 2.5 g/L yeast extract, 1 g/L KH2PO4·H2O, 0.5 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.05 g/L vitamin B1. 
Cultivation was conducted at 30°C in the dark. Numerous studies have shown that biomass and polysac-
charide production obtained using various G. lucidum strains were dependent on the type and concentra-
tion of carbon source, such as glucose, maltose, or saccharose. Glucose and maltose were confirmed as 
suitable carbon sources for mycelial biomass production, but not saccharose (Song et al., 2007). Using 
complex substrates, Fang and Zhong (2002a) noted the highest biomass (16.7 g/L) and IPS (1.19 g/L) 
production with a glucose-peptone-yeast extract medium, at initial glucose concentration of 50 g/L; at 
higher concentrations the yields were lower due to high osmotic pressure. However, EPS production 
of 1.08 g/L increased with an increase of glucose concentration, and the maximum value was observed 
at glucose concentration of 65 g/L. Berovic et al. (2003) observed significant EPS and IPS production 
by G. lucidum in a liquid potato dextrose-olive oil medium (9.6 and 6.3 g/L, respectively). Hsieh et al. 
(2005) reported that biomass production increased significantly with an increase of molasses concen-
tration, but the contrary was observed for EPS and IPS production. According to Xu et al. (2008), a 

160
Chapter 9  Cultivation of Medicinal Fungi in Bioreactors
composition of 16 g/L glucose, 2.93 g/L peptone, 20.93 g/L corn flour, and 6.44 g/L soybean powder 
resulted in 496 mg/L ganoderic acid production. Zhu et al. (2008) studied the stimulating effects of 
fungal elicitors on the production of ganoderic acids and polysaccharides in a submerged culture. Lee 
et al. (2003a,b) used deproteinated cheese whey for cultivating mycelia of G. lucidum in a bioreactor 
by submerged cultivation. However, proper mixing with other solid media was necessary to adjust the 
C/N ratio.
9.3.1.5  Influences of carbon and nitrogen sources, and C/N ratio
Tang and Zhong (2002) studied the effects of carbon sources and initial sugar concentration on the 
production of ganoderic acids and polysaccharides in a G. lucidum cultivation process. Sucrose was 
suitable as a carbon source for EPS polysaccharide production, although the cells did not grow well. 
Lactose was beneficial for cell growth and production of ganoderic acid and IPS. When the initial 
lactose concentration exceeded 35 g/L, ganoderic acid accumulation decreased. However, ganoderic 
acid production improved remarkably with pulse feeding of lactose, when the residual concentration 
was between 10 and 5 g/L. Fang and Zhong (2002a,b) studied the effects of nitrogen source and initial 
glucose concentration in submerged cultivation of G. lucidum for simultaneous production of bioac-
tive ganoderic acids and polysaccharides. The cells could not grow well when either yeast extract or 
peptone was used as the sole nitrogen source. However, addition of 5 g/L of yeast extract and 5 g/L of 
peptone was optimal for cell growth and metabolite production. Initial glucose concentration within 
20–65 g/L greatly affected cell growth and product biosynthesis. Different responses of polysaccharide 
production were observed under different limitations of nutrients. Of the carbon sources examined 
by Chang et al. (2006), brown sugar and malt extract most effectively promoted mycelial growth and 
the production of polysaccharides, while yeast extract and skim milk were the most effective nitrogen 
sources. By adding safflower seed oil in the medium, formation of mycelia increased significantly.
9.3.1.6  The effects of nitrogen sources and concentrations
Several studies have shown that organic nitrogen sources were more suitable than inorganic ones for 
biomass and polysaccharide production, due to the fact that essential amino acids could not be synthe-
sized from inorganic nitrogen sources. This observation was reconfirmed in a cultivation of G. lucidum 
HAI 447 (Simonic et al., 2008), where peptone was the optimum nitrogen source for biomass and for 
EPS production. According to Fang and Zhong (2002a), biomass and IPS production was maximal 
(15.8 and 0.9 g/L) with a combined usage of yeast extract and peptone in a ratio of 1:2, and EPS produc-
tion in a ratio of 1:1 (0.8 g/L). However, in cases when either yeast extract or peptone was used as the 
sole nitrogen source, production was not optimal, and glucose consumption was incomplete. Fang and 
Zhong (2002a) explained this observation by the fact that yeast extract and peptone had complementary 
effects in promoting the cell growth. Hsieh et al. (2006a,b) noted the best biomass production (5.6 g/L) 
and the lowest EPS production (1.4 g/L) in a medium with a corn-steep powder as the nitrogen source, 
at a concentration of 5.0 g/L. Biomass production increased with an increase of nitrogen source concen-
tration, while polysaccharide production was higher at a lower nitrogen concentration.
9.3.1.7  The influence of macro- and microelements
Macroelements, especially P and Mg, have significant effects on biomass and polysaccharide pro-
duction, as they are cofactors for some enzymes, catalyzing polysaccharide synthesis (Hsieh et al., 
2006a,b). However, Chang et al. (2006) reported that Ca addition caused a decrease in biomass and 

161
9.3  Cultivation of Medicinal Mushrooms in Bioreactors
an increase in polysaccharide production. The results of Simonic et al. (2008) on Fe influence on bio-
mass and polysaccharide production were in accordance with the previous results of Park et al. (2001). 
The best results were obtained in the medium containing maltose, peptone, K, Na, and Mg, inoculated 
with 20 mL of inoculum at pH 5.5 and under constant aeration. In a study by Song et al. (2007), when 
the cultivation medium was enriched with K, Na, and Mg at concentrations of 6.0, 3.0, and 2.0 mM, 
respectively, a mycelial biomass 29.2 g/L and EPS production of 2.9 mg/mL were obtained. IPS produc-
tion was increased with an increase of K and Na concentration, while in the case of Mg it was 53.3 mg/g.
9.3.1.8  The effects of plant oils and fatty acids
Several plant oils, which can be used as antifoam agents, may be beneficial to fungal growth. Lee et al. 
(1999) used a commercial brand of an antifoaming agent at a volume fraction of 0.5%, while Habijanic 
and Berovic (2002) used olive oil at a volume fraction of 2%. The advantages of plant oils are their low 
cost and the possibility of higher growth yields due to their stimulatory properties. The effects of soy, 
peanut, safflower, corn, sunflower, and olive oils were investigated by Yang et al. (2000) at a volume 
fraction of 1%. EPS production was highest with safflower oil. In studying the effects of fatty acids, no 
general relationship could be identified between either the length of the carbon chain or the extent of its 
unsaturation and the level of growth stimulation.
9.3.1.9  The effect of polymer additives
Through the addition of a polymer into the medium, very uniform and tiny pellets could be formed dur-
ing inoculum preparation. The addition of polymers, such as Carbopol 934 (carboxypolymethylene), 
Junlon (polyacrylic acid), and Hostacerin (sodium polyacrylate), reduced agglomeration, and hence 
decreased pellet formation in many filamentous fungi (Jones et al., 1988). Junlon was found to be effec-
tive in preventing mycelia aggregation. Polymer additives and a novel agitation scheme were employed 
by Yang et al. (2009) to vary mycelia morphology, which in turn led to higher mycelium production 
rates. The effect of various polymer additives, including sodium alginate, polyacrylmide, and agar, on 
mycelia growth was investigated.
9.3.1.10  Ganoderma lucidum cultivation in an STB
The optimum agitation rate represents a balance between oxygen transfer into the medium and shear 
forces, both of which increase with the agitation rate. Yang and Liau (1998) suggested that higher 
shaking speeds favored EPS production, because they decreased the adsorption of the secreted EPS 
on the cell wall, providing stimulus for further EPS synthesis. However, a mechanism by which this 
stimulus would occur was not proposed. Berovic et al. (2003) cultivated G. lucidum in an STB using 
a liquid substrate based on potato dextrose and olive oil. A cultivation temperature of 30°C, mixing at 
300 rpm, aeration of 1 L/min, pH 5.8–4.2, oxygen partial pressure of 70–80%, and redox potential Eh 
300–400 mV were applied.
9.3.1.11  Ganoderma lucidum cultivation in airlift bioreactor
Lee et al. (1999) cultivated G. lucidum in an airlift bioreactor at 25°C with an aeration rate of 2.5 vvm 
under batch conditions. With the bistage pH control technique, in which pH was shifted from 3 to 6 
at the initial phase of exponential growth, 20.1 g/L of exopolysaccharides were produced; desirable 
mycelia morphologies were retained during the cultivation, and a low viscosity and yield stress in the 
culture broth were maintained.

162
Chapter 9  Cultivation of Medicinal Fungi in Bioreactors
9.3.2  SOLID-STATE CULTIVATION OF G. LUCIDUM
Solid-state cultivation of G. lucidum has several advantages, such as low investment cost, easier opera-
tion, and minimal waste production, as well as some disadvantages, including longer cultivation time 
and the difficulty of separating/isolating the biomass and pharmaceutically active compounds from 
the solid substrate. Data on G. lucidum solid-state cultivation in bioreactors are scarce. Habijanic and 
Berovic (2002) patented a process of growing G. lucidum on a solid cultivation substrate using solid-
state cultivation in a horizontal stirred bioreactor. Beech sawdust was used as the cultivation substrate. 
Large quantities of biomass were produced, including pharmaceutically applicable products.
9.3.2.1  The influence of substrate composition
For the production of G. lucidum mycelia in a bioreactor by Habijanic and Berovic (2000, 2002), 
the substrate consisted of beech sawdust, olive oil, (NH4)2SO4, KH2PO4, CaCl2·2H2O, MgSO4·7H2O, 
FeSO4·7H2O, and distilled water. During cultivation, the content of EPS in the solids increased rapidly 
over the first 7 days, remained relatively constant until 21 days, and then decreased, suggesting that 
the polysaccharide was actually degraded in the latter stages of the process. The period during which 
the polysaccharide content decreased corresponded with the time in which the water mass fraction was 
falling rapidly from the values of 70–80% that were maintained during the first 21 days to 20% at 35 
days (Habijanic and Berovic, 2002). Song et al. (2007) used a whey permeate as an alternative additive 
to a growth medium for the cultivation G. lucidum mycelia in a solid-state cultivation. Optimal condi-
tions were found at pH 4.4 and 29°C. The results showed that the cultivation of G. lucidum mycelia 
could be a potential cost-effective solution for treatment of cheese whey permeates. However, proper 
mixing with other solid media was necessary to adjust the C/N ratio. In a rare report, cultivation was 
carried out in a horizontal STB with a total working volume of 30 L (Habijanic and Berovic, 2002). 
Conditions were controlled as follows: temperature 30°C, airflow 2 L/min, agitation rate 80 rpm for 
2 min every second day during the first 7 days, and every day during the latter stages of the cultivation. 
The effect of initial moisture content was evaluated. An aw of at least 0.85 was necessary to get satisfac-
tory rates of cell growth and exopolysaccharide production.
9.3.3  SUBMERGED CULTIVATION OF G. FRONDOSA
9.3.3.1  Inoculum
In a study carried out by Bae et al. (2005), the stock culture was maintained on potato dextrose agar 
slants, incubated at 27°C for 5 days, and then stored at 4°C. The seed culture was grown at 27°C on 
a rotary shaker incubator at 120 rpm for 5 days in a 250-mL flask containing 50 mL of the following 
medium: 30 g/L glucose, 6 g/L yeast extract, 2 g/L polypeptone, 0.5 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g/L K2HPO4, 
and 0.2 g/L MnSO4·5H2O. The cultivation media were inoculated with 3% (v/v) of the seed culture and 
then cultivated at 27°C in a 5-L STB.
9.3.3.2  The effect of initial pH
Lee et al. (2004) reported that pH 5.5 was the optimal initial level for both mycelial biomass and EPS 
production with G. frondosa in a submerged culture. These results were reconfirmed by Shih et al. 
(2008), and were consistent with the fact that many fungi have acidic pH optima during submerged 
cultivation (Yang and Liau, 1998; Fang and Zhong, 2002a; Hsieh et al., 2006a,b).

163
9.3  Cultivation of Medicinal Mushrooms in Bioreactors
9.3.3.3  The effects of carbon and nitrogen sources
The influence of carbon sources for mycelial biomass and EPS production was studied by Shih et al. 
(2008). In media containing various carbon sources, i.e., sucrose, maltose, glucose, fructose, and 
molasses, each carbon source was added to the basal medium at 20 or 40 g/L. Maltose and glucose 
were preferred carbon sources for high mycelial production. The concentration of EPS was doubled 
(0.76–1.49 g/L) after 13 days of cultivation when added glucose increased from 2 to 4 g/L. Yeast extract 
in combination with corn-steep powder (0.4:0.6 or 0.8:1.2 g/L) were preferred nitrogen sources for high 
production of mycelia and EPS. The conclusion was that an increase of carbon source concentration 
led to an increase in EPS production for all carbon sources tested; in contrast, mycelium dry weight 
showed no substantial increase when the concentration of carbon source increased (Zhu, 2006).
9.3.3.4  The effects of plant oils and surfactants
Under high oxygen concentration supply in an STB, the production of mycelial biomass and EPS was 
greatly enhanced with 1% olive oil addition in 21% O2 and 40% O2 (Hsieh et al., 2006a). In a further 
study by Hsieh et al. (2008), the effects of adding various plant oils and surfactants were examined in 
terms of cell growth and production of EPS and IPS in a submerged culture of G. frondosa with 2% 
and 4% glucose medium. Olive, safflower seed, soy, and sunflower oils were favorable plant oil sources 
for mycelial growth. The highest cell growth, 12.6 g/L, was obtained after 13 days of cultivation in a 
medium containing 1% of plant oils. EPS polysaccharide production was slightly enhanced by olive oil, 
but significantly inhibited by safflower seed oil and sunflower oil after 13 days of cultivation. Among 
four plant oil sources examined, cell growth yielded relatively high mycelial biomass of 11.22 g/L 
in 4% glucose medium with 0.5% soybean oil. High EPS polysaccharide production of 2.24 g/L and 
slightly lower cell growth were found with 4% glucose media with olive oil addition. Tween 80 and 
Span 80 addition showed increased cell growth. A maximal cell concentration of 9.10 g/L was obtained 
with 1% Span 80 addition. However, both EPS and IPS production decreased with all the tested con-
centrations of Tween 80 and Span 80 addition. The worst results were obtained with Tween 20 and 
Span 20 addition—these were shown to have serious inhibiting effects on cell growth of G. frondosa 
and also on polysaccharide production (Yang et al., 2000).
9.3.3.5  The effects of oxygen concentration
Hsieh et al. (2006a) examined the effects of oxygen concentrations of 21%, 30%, and 40% on the pro-
duction of mycelial biomass and polysaccharides with G. frondosa in a 5-L STB. The 40% concentration 
of oxygen was found to inhibit both cell growth and polysaccharide production, with a higher rate of glu-
cose consumption. The highest cell concentration of 9.29 g/L was found at day 9 with 21% O2. Oxygen 
concentrations also affected intercellular polysaccharide production. With 21% O2, intercellular poly-
saccharides reached a maximum concentration 19.5 mg/g at 11 days with 30% O2, and 21.9 mg/g at 8 
days and 28.2 mg/g with 40% O2 at 7 days. On the other hand, EPS production increased from 0.7–0.9 
to 2.24–3.00 g/L at 13 days with 21% O2 and 40% O2 aeration, respectively.
9.3.3.6  Grifola frondosa cultivation in an STB
To find the optimal operational parameters in a 5-L STB, the self-directing optimization technique 
was used by Lee et al. (2004), with culture pH 5.06, aeration rate of 1.16 vvm, and agitation rate of 
166 rpm. Mycelial morphology was significantly altered by culture pH, aeration rate, and hydrodynamic 

164
Chapter 9  Cultivation of Medicinal Fungi in Bioreactors
characteristics, which subsequently affected the yield of EPS production. While compact pellets were 
formed under low aeration conditions, freely suspended mycelial growth was observed at high aeration 
conditions. Under optimal culture conditions, maximum biomass concentration and EPS production 
in an STB were 16.8 and 5.3 g/L, respectively, which were significantly greater than results prior to 
optimization (13 and 4 g/L, respectively).
Bae et al. (2005) used a 5-L STB with a working volume of 3 L, a 3% (v/v) inoculum of 5-day-
old seed culture, and cultivation parameters of 27°C, aeration rate 1.0 vvm, agitation speed 150 rpm, 
and pH 5.5. Biomass concentration at 4 days was 24.8 g/L, and EPSs were 7.2 g/L. Xing et al. (2006) 
investigated the effects of nutritional parameters in batch and fed-batch cultivation in a 5-L STB. 
Cui et al. (2006) applied a 15-L STB equipped with three six-bladed Rusthon disc impellers. Batch 
cultivation was carried out under inoculation volume 10% (v/v), temperature 25°C, initial pH 5.5, 
aeration rate 8.0 vvm, and agitation speed 80 rpm. A maximum mycelial biomass yield of 22.50 g/L 
was achieved. Habijanic et al. (2009) cultivated G. frondosa in a 5-L airlift reactor on substrate that 
consisted of 45 g/L glucose, 6.5 g/L peptone, 3 g/L KH2PO4, and 7 g/L olive oil. Cultivation was car-
ried out at 28°C and aeration of 50 L/h; 4.5 g/L dry biomass, 183 mg/L of EPS, and 480 mg/L IPS were 
obtained.
9.3.3.7  Grifola frondosa cultivation in airlift bioreactor
In a comparative study by Suzuki et al. (1989), G. frondosa was cultured in a 5 L airlift bioreactor. 
Mycelial biomass yields of 10 g/L and EPS yields of 4.53 g/L were lower than those produced in an 
STB. Lin and Liu (2006), in a 2-L airlift reactor, used 150 mL of seed culture for inoculating a medium 
consisting of 40 g of glucose, 10 g of malt extract, and 5 g of yeast extract per 1 L of distilled water, at 
pH 4.5. The cultivation was carried out at an aeration rate of 0.5 vvm and 25°C for 14 days. A maximum 
12.8 g/L of biomass was produced.

Cheap substrates composed of secondary raw materials, such as agricultural, food, and wood indus-
try residues, with little pretreatment or enrichment with mineral salts (MgSO4·7H2O, K2HPO4, and 
MnSO4·5H2O), can be used for G. frondosa cultivation (Berovic et al., 2008). Xing et al. (2006) used a 
substrate consisting of (dry weight basis) 75% of oak sawdust (25% humidity), 23% of corn bran (15% 
humidity), 1% sucrose (2% humidity), and 1% of calcium carbonate. The moisture content was then 
adjusted to 62%. Svagelj et al. (2008) cultivated G. frondosa in a 15-L horizontal STB using various 
substrates based on beech, Norwegian spruce, European larch, or common grape vine (Vitis vinifera) 
sawdust with 75% humidity. The best results were obtained with milled whole corn plant straw and the 
addition of (20% dry weight) wheat bran, 2% CaCO3, 2% olive oil, and olive press cake supplemented 
with mineral additives at 28°C. Periodic mixing at 80 rpm was applied for 2 min/day and aeration of 
5 L/h throughout the cultivation. Maintenance of the moisture content in the solid substrate was found 
to be of crucial importance. Moistures higher than 70% promoted the growth of G. frondosa mycelium 
and polysaccharide production. Four fractions of pure EPS β-d-glucans with a total mass 127.2 mg and 
four fractions of IPS with total mass 47.2 mg were isolated (Svagelj et al., 2008, Gregori et al., 2009).

9.3.5  CULTIVATION OF T. VERSICOLOR
9.3.5.1  Submerged cultivation of T. versicolor
Trametes versicolor cultivation was conducted on milk whey and beer worth (Klecak et al., 2009), 
tomato pomace (Freixo et al., 2008), barley husk, oak and cornbeam sawdust (Tisma et al., 2012), and 
bread crumbs in a submerged culture (Ivanova et al., 2014). The influence of various nutrient sources 
on EPS production and biomass yield by submerged culture of T. versicolor was investigated. The best 
EPS production by T. versicolor was achieved after stimulation with sucrose ranging within 1.00–1.80 
and 1.80–2.00 mg/L. The lowest EPS production was recorded using xylose and glucose. Xylose and 
sorbitol supported the highest biomass yield (1.9 g dry weight/L and 2.0 g dry weight/L, respectively) 
by T. versicolor, and yeast extract induced the highest EPS production (7.83 mg/L). The EPS ranged 
within 0.70–0.78 mg/L. Yeast extract and NaNO3 induced the highest biomass yield by T. versicolor; 
ranging within 1.0–1.6 g dry weight/L and 2.0–1.9 g dry weight/L. The least stimulatory amino acids 
were alanine and glutamate, while the best amino acids for biomass production by the isolates were 
aspartic acid and asparagines, in ranges within 1.0–15.0 g dry weight/L and 1.0–16.0 g dry weight/L, 
respectively.
9.3.5.2  The effects of carbon sources on biomass and EPS
Bolla et al. (2010) used a basal medium containing MgSO4·7H2O (0.2 g), K2HPO4 (1.0 g), NH4SO4 
(5.0 g), d-glucose (9.75 g), yeast extract (3.0 g), peptone (1.0 g), and 1.0 L of distilled water. Also, 97.5 g 
of carbon of each carbon source (lactose, glucose, sucrose, maltose, mannose, galactose, fructose, 
xylose, sorbitol, and starch) were supplements to the basal medium. The pH of the basal medium 
was adjusted to 6. The basal medium without any carbon source served as control. Further, 100 mL 
of each basal medium was dispensed into a corresponding 500-mL flask and autoclaved at 121°C for 
15 min. In order to suppress bacterial growth, 1 mL of streptomycin was added. Then the flasks were 
inoculated with 10% of 5-day-old actively growing cultures of T. versicolor. Finally, the flasks were 
incubated at 25°C for 2, 4, 7, and 14 days. The cultivation medium was then analyzed for biomass and 
EPS production.
9.3.5.3  The effects of nitrogen and amino acid sources on biomass and EPS
Bolla et al. (2010) used a basal medium made up of 10.0 g glucose, 0.1 g NaCl, 0.1 g CaCl2, 0.5 g 
KH2PO4, 0.5 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 mg thiamine hydrochloride, and 1.00 L distilled water. The medium 
was supplemented separately with amino acids and inorganic nitrogen sources at a rate of 1.0 g per liter. 
Complex nitrogen sources (casein, urea, yeast extract, and peptone) were supplemented at a concentra-
tion of 2.0 g/L. The liquid without any nitrogen source served as control. Further, 100 mL of each liquid 
medium was dispensed into a conical flask and treated as described in the carbon medium experiment.
9.3.6  SOLID-STATE CULTIVATION OF T. VERSICOLOR
Kneževic´ et al. (2013) used wheat straw and oak sawdust as carbon sources, and 10 mL of modified 
synthetic medium without glucose, with NH4NO3 and pH 6.5. Stoilova et al. (2010) used wheat bran 
and oat straw as carbon sources. Solid-state cultivation was carried out using a medium consisting 
of 4.0 g wheat bran, 2.5 g oat straw, and 2.5 g beetroot press in 300-mL flasks. The moisture of the 

166
Chapter 9  Cultivation of Medicinal Fungi in Bioreactors
substrate was adjusted to 60% by mineral salt solution containing 0.14% (NH4)2SO4, 0.2% KH2PO4, 
0.03% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.03% CaCl2, FeSO4·7H2O, ZnSO4·7H2O, MnSO4·7H2O, and 0.002% CoCl2 at 
pH 4.5. Rakus et al. (2015) cultivated T. versicolor mycelia in solid-state cultivation on corn straw in 
a 15-L horizontal STB. The moisture content of the substrate before inoculation was 2.33 (w/w dry 
biomass). The inoculum consisted of twenty-five 1 cm2 cuts mixed in a sterile grinder together with 
700 ml of sterilized distilled water. The cultivation of T. versicolor biomass was carried out at 24°C 
and the airflow was 5 L/min. Periodic mixing at 80 rpm per 2 min (in the first 7 days every second day, 
and 2 minutes every day in the last part of cultivation) was used. In the end, 5.95 g/L IPS were isolated.
9.3.7  SUBMERGED CULTIVATION OF H. ERINACEUS
Krzyczkowski et al. (2009) optimized the production of IPS and EPS of H. erinaceus in a submerged 
culture. Various factors, including carbon and nitrogen sources, vitamins, mineral elements, and initial 
pH, had significant effects when tested using a 24 central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Under 
optimal culture conditions, the maximum yield of biomass reached 14.24 g/L, 1.85-fold higher than 
in the basal medium. The kinetics of EPS biosynthesis in a bioreactor showed that the highest yield 
of 2.75 g/L of EPS could be obtained on the eighth day of cultivation. The process of biosynthesizing 
high-molecular-weight polysaccharides proceeded through 14 days of cultivation after the depletion of 
the carbon source in the medium. The results are very helpful in the large-scale production of bioactive 
polysaccharides from H. erinaceus (Krzyczkowski et al., 2009).
In the second study by Krzyczkowski et al. (2010), the most favorable combination of nutrient 
medium constituents, ensuring the highest erinacine production, was found to be 69.87 g/L glucose, 
11.17 g/L casein peptone, 1.45 g/L NaCl, 55.24 mg/L ZnSO4, 1.0 g/L KH2PO4, and pH 4.5. The kinet-
ics of metabolite biosynthesis were examined during cultivation in a 10 L bioreactor. The biomass was 
13.52  g/L, while the production of erinacine A was 192.42 mg/L. The best results were obtained after  
8 days of cultivation. A new diterpene from the fungal mycelia of H. erinaceus was found by Zhang 
et al. (2015). The effects of medium composition and cultivation parameters on the simultaneous pro-
duction of mycelial biomass and EPS by H. erinaceus CZ-2 were investigated in submerged cultures 
by a one-factor-at-a-time method using an orthogonal array design. The most suitable carbon, nitro-
gen, and mineral sources, and cofactors for the mycelial biomass and exopolymer production were 
corn flour combined with 1% glucose, yeast extract, KH2PO4, and corn steep liquor. The effects of 
nutritional requirements on the mycelial growth of H. erinaceus CZ-2 were in the regular sequence 
of corn flour combined with 1% glucose > yeast extract > corn steep liquor > KH2PO4, and those 
on exopolymer production were in the order of corn flour combined with glucose > KH2PO4 >yeast 
extract > corn steep liquor. A maximum of 16.07 g/L biomass was obtained when the composition of 
the culture medium was 30 g/L corn flour, 10 g/L glucose, 3 g/L yeast extract, 1 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L 
CaCO3, and 15 mL/L corn steep liquor; 1.31 g/L exopolymer yield was achieved when the composition 
of medium was 30 g/L corn flour, 10 g/L glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L CaCO3, and 
15 g/L mL/L corn steep liquor. In the 15-L STB cultivation, a maximum of 20.50 g/L mycelial biomass 
was achieved using the optimized medium (Huang et al., 2007).
9.3.8  SOLID-STATE CULTIVATION OF H. ERINACEUS
The potential for using several agricultural by-products as supplements of sawdust substrate was evalu-
ated by Ko et al. (2005). Gerbec et al. (2015) cultivated H. erinaceus in a 15-L horizontal STB (HSTB) 

167
9.4  Conclusions
using the design and construction of Berovic et al. (2012). The cultivation was carried out at 24°C and 
5 L/min airflow. Periodic mixing at 80 rpm for 2 min (in the first 7 days every second day, and every day 
in the last part of cultivation) was used (Gerbec et al., 2015). Han (2003) studied H. erinaceus solid-
state cultivation on corn meal degrading starch, and found an upgrading of its nutritional value.
9.3.9  SUBMERGED CULTIVATION OF C. MILITARIS
A study by Mao and Zhong (2006), using a chemically defined medium, indicated that NH4
+ played an 
important role in cordycepin biosynthesis. In a complex medium, peptone was identified as the best nitro-
gen source for cordycepin biosynthesis (Song et al., 1998). Park et al. (2001) reported that exopolysac­
charide production and mycelial growth in the submerged culture of C. militaris were almost tripled by 
supplementation with vegetable oils in the medium (Park et al., 2001). Mao and Zhong (2004) investi-
gated submerged cultivation of C. militaris and the effect of oxygen supply on cordycepin production in 
a 5-L STB. Initial volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa) within the range of 11.5–113.8 h−1 had a 
significant influence on cordycepin production. A cordycepin concentration of 167.5 mg/L was obtained 
at an initial kLa value of 54.5 h−1, where a moderate dissolved oxygen (DO) pattern was observed 
throughout cultivation. A higher cordycepin production of 201.1 mg/L was achieved by a proposed DO 
control strategy. Similar results were obtained by Park et al. (2002). Mao and Zhong (2006) also found 
in a fed-batch culture in a 3.5-L STB that NH4
+ feeding with peptone enhanced cordycepin production. 
By optimizing the feeding time and feeding amount of NH4
+, a maximal cordycepin concentration of 
420.55 mg/L was obtained, which was 70% higher than in batch cultivation (Mao and Zhong, 2006).
9.3.10  SOLID-STATE CULTIVATION OF C. MILITARIS
Substrates of rye seeds and spent brewing grains were mixed in different ratios (9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 
4:6). Water was added to the mixture to achieve 65% moisture content and 100 g of substrate. To date, 
concentrations of 10.42 mg/g of cordycepin have been reported (Gregori, 2014).
9.3.11  CULTIVATION OF OTHER MEDICINAL MUSHROOM SPECIES  
IN BIOREACTORS
Besides the cultures presented in this chapter, there are some other medicinal mushrooms, such as 
Agaricus brasiliensis, Agrocybe argerita, Antrodia camphorata, Auricularia polytricha, Inonolus 
obliquus, Collybia marculate, Phelinius gilvus, and Sarcodon asparatus, suitable to be cultivated in 
laboratory-scale STBs. Schizophyllum commune was cultivated in airlift and bubble column reactors. 
Although several medicinal mushroom species are suitable for large-scale production, only A. cam-
phorata has reportedly been cultivated in a 500-L pilot-scale stirred reactor having 350 L of working 
volume (Tang et al., 2007).
9.4  CONCLUSIONS
The reports on pharmacological activity of extracts, partly purified preparations, and isolated com-
pounds from medicinal mushroom biomass of G. lucidum, G. frondosa, T. versicolor, H. erinaceus, and 
C. militaris are based on experimental research. Their biotechnological cultivation in bioreactors has 

168
Chapter 9  Cultivation of Medicinal Fungi in Bioreactors
mostly been studied in laboratory- and pilot-scale installations. There is abundant scientific evidence 
that triterpenoids, polysaccharides, and proteoglycans have been effective in in vitro and in vivo testing. 
The synergistic effects of mixtures of active components have been known, but their biological activi-
ties need further assessment before they can be fully accepted, not only by traditional Asian medicine, 
but also by Western science and medicine. In this respect, modern biotechnological cultivation methods 
in bioreactors enable fast, efficient, and economic production of medicinal fungi in sufficient quantities 
for future potential production of pharmaceuticals at a large industrial level.

10.1  AGRO-FOOD INDUSTRIAL WASTES AS RAW MATERIALS
Agricultural and agro-food by-products or residues such as bagasse, marc, bran, husk, shell, peel, pits, 
seeds, straw, leaves, or prunings from various crops (sugarcane, wheat, soy, rice, barley, corn, apple, 
orange, grapes, vine, treenuts, olives, cotton) are constantly generated as a result of industrial processing  
(Devesa-Rey et al., 2011; Dhillon et al., 2011; Mirabella et al., 2014; Sánchez, 2009).
These by-products have no major applications in the production line, being rarely employed as an 
alternative substrate for a second process or use. As a consequence, their disposal causes problems in 
various ways. Additionally, residues must be kept until their disposal, occupying space in the industrial 
enclosure or in fields, resulting in extra costs for companies. This drawback is usually avoided by burn-
ing some agro-food wastes, mainly those of a lignocellulosic nature, although this practice is tending to 
be banned since it leads to environmental pollution problems as well as a risk to human health, due to 
the formation of toxic compounds from lignin combustion (Bustos et al., 2004).
Another common treatment involves composting of organic matter, which could be applied in the 
ground as a natural fertilizer. It must be taken into account that composting generates leachates that 
can infiltrate the subsoil and reach groundwater, thus becoming an environmental problem if not cor-
rectly treated (García-López et al., 2014; Mirabella et al., 2014). Nevertheless, there are several dis-
advantages associated with this type of treatment, since attainment of compost requires considerable 
time, usually months, and it is an activity which does not get full use of the potential residue as a 
raw material. Once obtained, the use of compost from agroindustrial residues rarely meets nutritional 
soil requirements because of its unbalanced C/N composition and the possible presence of toxigenic 
compounds such as heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cd) or herbicides that could destroy or pollute 
crops and soils. These aspects necessitate a strategy of adjusting compost composition to plant needs 
and removing such harmful compounds from composts to make them suitable for soil nourishment  
(de Alencar Guimaraes et al., 2013; Facchini et al., 2011; Özbas¸ and Balkaya, 2014; Sánchez, 2009; 
Santos et al., 2014).

Chapter 10  USE OF ASPERGILLUS NIGER EXTRACTS
Although some residues have been employed for animal feeding, there is no doubt that this alterna-
tive does not take advantage of the whole waste potential for the production of high value-added prod-
ucts, dismissing a good opportunity, considering that agricultural and food industry residues represent 
an abundant and inexpensive alternative source of valuable compounds.
Currently, a growing number of scientific works in the biorefinery field aim at “zero waste” disposal, 
where wastes are used as raw material for new products such as saccharides, organic acids, or phenolic 
compounds by such clean technologies as fermentation or enzymatic hydrolysis. In this way, an initial 
waste and environmental problem is turned into a cheap and readily available substrate. Consequently, 
these residues have attracted considerable interest because of their possible use in biotransformation 
to obtain “low volume-high cost” products or bioenergy (Mirabella et al., 2014). Because of all that, 
agricultural and food industry by-products and residues represent an inexpensive alternative source 
for microbial growth and enzyme production mainly using solid-state fermentation (SSF) (de Alencar 
Guimaraes et al., 2013; Haltrich et al., 1997).
SSF is useful for valorizing complex materials including agricultural, forestry, and food processing 
residues and wastes. Valorization as raw materials can be achieved, on the one hand, by using lignocel-
lulosic materials as fungal mycelia support and a nutritional source for fungi growth and enzymatic 
production. On the other hand, different compounds can be enzymatically released from agriculture 
and food industry residues matrices, including saccharides, organic acids, or phenolic compounds 
among others, with many applications in sundry industrial fields.
10.2  LIGNOCELLULOSIC COMPOSITION OF AGROINDUSTRIAL WASTES
Most of the potentially valuable residues from agricultural, food, and feed industries have a lignocellu-
losic nature. The crops’ plant cell wall is mainly composed of three polymers: cellulose, hemicellulose, 
and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose represent the two major quantitative polysaccharides in plant 
cell wall, and lignin is the most abundant noncarbohydrate constituent (Berlin et al., 2005; de Vries 
and Visser, 2001). The principal component of lignocellulosic biomass is cellulose, a linear homopol-
ymer composed of d-glucose units linked by β-1,4 glucosidic bonds (de Vries and Visser, 2001).  
The second most abundant organic structure in the plant cell wall is hemicellulose, which is a  
heterogeneous polysaccharide. The predominant polymer in hardwood hemicelluloses fraction 
is xylan, comprising up to 20–35% dry weight of agricultural wastes. Xylan consists mainly of a  
backbone chain of β-1,4-linked d-xylopyranose residues, which are substituted by different side 
groups such as l-arabinose, d-galactose, acetyl, feruloyl, p-coumaroyl, and glucuronic acid residues, 
which represent a small fraction (de Vries and Visser, 2001; Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014). Finally, 
lignin has a complex, heterogeneous, polymeric structure derived from three monolignol mono-
mers, methoxylated to various degrees: p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol 
(Majumdar et al., 2014).
The hemicellulose chains coat the cellulose fibrils and interact with lignin, being all entangled, 
thereby ensuring the mechanical and structural stability of the plant cell wall, limiting cell growth, and 
supplying resistance to chemical and biological degradation agents (de Vries and Visser, 2001). Given 
that the already mentioned characteristics provided by hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin help the 
plant to persist in natural environment, degradation of polysaccharides becomes a complex step in the 
industrial use of lignocellulosic materials.

175
10.3  Enzymes Involved in Lignocellulose Degradation
Chemical processing for the fractionation and valorization of lignocellulosic materials has been 
employed for years in various industries. However, an increasing awareness of environmental pollution 
has forced industries to replace the use of harsh chemicals with environmentally friendly procedures 
(de Alencar Guimaraes et al., 2013). Enzymatic hydrolysis is a greener technology which provides a 
good alternative to preserve nature, especially when a subsequent food or feed use is required.
10.3  ENZYMES INVOLVED IN LIGNOCELLULOSE DEGRADATION
Several classes of enzymes are involved in the biodegradation of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin 
fractions. The cellulose fraction can be hydrolyzed by four classes of enzymes, namely endoglucanases, 
cellobiohydrolases, β-glucosidases, and exoglucanases (de Vries and Visser, 2001). The hemicellulosic 
fraction presents a more heterogeneous polymeric composition, so that many diverse enzymes are 
involved in hemicellulose degradation. Although endoxylanases and β-xylosidase are the enzymes that 
hydrolyze the xylan backbone (Juturu and Wu, 2012), their activity is improved by the activity of 
so-called accessory enzymes such as α-l-arabinofuranosidases, arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase, 
α-glucuronidases, β-xylosidases, arabinases, galactosidases, galactanases and feruloyl, coumaroyl, and 
acetyl and methylesterases, which are responsible for cleavage of the xylan side chains (de Vries et al., 
2000). Although in low amounts, pectins are also components of the plant cell wall and, consequently, 
different enzymes are involved in the degradation of this polysaccharide with lyase and hydrolase 
activities. There are several studies reporting the ability of several Aspergillus species to produce a 
broad spectrum of most of these enzymes (de Vries and Visser, 2001), and the importance of synergism 
between them has also been described, which is in good agreement with the coordinated regulation of 
gene expression (de Vries et al., 2000). Finally, lignin’s degrading enzymes are laccase, lignin peroxi-
dase, and manganese peroxidase (Wang et al., 2013), which are mainly produced by white-rot fungi.
Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials has been traditionally focused on cellulose, which is the most 
abundant plant polysaccharide, to obtain glucose. However, the presence of hemicellulose and lignin 
can restrict cellulose hydrolysis. In particular, lignin appears to limit cellulose hydrolysis by forming 
a physical barrier that reduces the access of enzymes to their specific substrates (Berlin et al., 2005). 
Effective hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials requires a synergistic action between the enzymes 
responsible for cleaving the different bonds, making possible the cooperation between the main-chain-
cleaving enzymes with the so-called “accessory enzymes.” Hemicellulases can enhance cellulose 
hydrolysis in terms of speed and hydrolysis yield by the removal of the noncellulosic polysaccharides 
or by enabling the release of other saccharides and other compounds from the recalcitrant substrate 
(Berlin et al., 2007; de Vries and Visser, 2001; Robl et al., 2013).
In particular, xylanases are hemicellulosic enzymes with accessory roles in the hydrolysis of cel-
lulose in lignocellulose materials. Xylanases are involved in the depolymerization of xylan by releasing 
d-xylooligosaccharides (Collins et al., 2005). Filamentous fungi are particularly good producers of this 
enzyme from an industrial point of view, attracting greater attention than bacteria and yeasts due to 
the generally higher values of xylanolytic activity produced, and also because of fungal metabolism, 
having a natural capacity to grow and degrade lignocellulosic materials, allowing the production of 
related enzymes. Extracellular release of xylanases into the medium by fungi, avoiding the need for 
cell disruption, is another remarkable point for industrial purposes (de Alencar Guimaraes et al., 2013; 
Haltrich et al., 1997).

10.4  FUNGAL SSF
Fungi are saprotrophic organisms with a naturally adapted metabolism enabling them to synthesize and 
secrete enzymes having the capacity to degrade tissues. Thus, fungi are the spotlight microorganisms 
of many scientific assays to obtain hydrolytic enzymes. In this context, SSF is the most widespread 
technique for fungal growth and enzyme production, emerging as an appropriate technology for the 
management of agroindustrial residues. SSF can be defined as the culture of microorganisms on moist 
solids in the absence or near absence of free water. Solid culture processes present advantages over sub-
merged fermentation, including higher concentration of products, higher volumetric productivity, better 
product recovery, higher oxygen availability, lower capital investment, simpler fermentation equipment 
and technique, and less generation of effluents, among others (Facchini et al., 2011; Mrudula and 
Murugammal, 2011; Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014). These cultivation conditions are particularly suit-
able for the growth of fungi, which are known to be able to colonize solid materials with relatively low 
water activity, unlike most bacteria and yeasts (Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014). Fermentation conditions 
in solid-state systems resemble those circumstances present in the natural habitats of fungi. Fungi’s 
inherent mechanisms for enzyme production developed and improved over centuries of adaptation to 
these environments (Singhania et al., 2009), which are usually characterized by a high surface area 
in contact with air and reduced water activity. They have a significant influence on fungal metabo-
lism since they favor oxygen availability for aerobic metabolism and can even affect gene expression  
(te Biesebeke et al., 2002).
The regulation of fungal synthesis of enzymes degrading polymeric substances, such as xylanases, 
is based on many feedback processes. First, filamentous fungi synthesize and release into the external 
environment low levels of certain hydrolases. These hydrolases act on the polymeric matrices, such 
as lignocellulose materials, releasing soluble monomers, which penetrate the cell membrane. Then 
the liberated compounds and other molecules present in the medium generate the appropriate cell 
signal that triggers the production of larger quantities of the enzymes necessary for its breakdown  
(Haltrich et al., 1997). Fungi produce specific enzymes to get nutrients from a particular medium, and 
in this way fungal metabolism induces the synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes to degrade polymers from 
biomass to digestible compounds.
According to the aforementioned, xylanolytic activity in fungi is inducible, and xylan is the best 
xylanolytic enzyme inducer for several filamentous fungi (Knob et al., 2009). Therefore, substrates 
containing large quantities of xylan, such as corn cob, are keys in xylanase induction. Considering 
that fungi seem to produce specific xylanases based on the chemical composition and structure of 
their substrate, the best way to obtain such enzymes for corn cob hydrolysis consists in producing 
them ad hoc by growing fungal cultures also on corn cob (Figure 10.1). In this way, fungi can upgrade 
xylanase secretion to the same substrate in a more specific process that can offer the prospect of higher  
hydrolysis yields.
Fungal enzyme production in SSF is affected by several environmental factors. The nature of solid 
substrates, temperature, pH, water activity and moisture, carbon and nitrogen sources, minerals, parti-
cle size, aeration, pretreatment of lignocellulosic residues, or bed-loading are parameters that can affect 
the metabolism of filamentous fungi, and many authors have studied several conditions to improve 
xylanase production (Ahmad et al., 2012b; Bakri et al., 2008; Benedetti et al., 2013; Dobrev et al., 
2007; Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014; Singhania et al., 2009). Furthermore, during the scale-up of fungal

10.5  ASPERGILLUS NIGER FOR THE PRODUCTION OF XYLANASES
SSF systems by using bioreactors, the most important parameters that need consideration include agi-
tation, aeration and oxygen transfer, temperature and moisture of the solid substrate, and air humidity 
(Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014).
10.5  ASPERGILLUS NIGER FOR THE PRODUCTION OF XYLANASES
The ability of the genus Aspergillus to produce a wide range of natural products such as enzymes jus-
tifies extensive research and the economical and industrial importance of biotechnological processes 
involving these fungi (Carvalho et al., 2012; de Vries and Visser, 2001; Knuf and Nielsen, 2012).
Aspergillus are filamentous fungi included in the Ascomycota phylum. Other renowned fungi such 
as Penicillium spp. or Trichoderma spp. are also part of this taxonomic group (Karpe et al., 2014). 
The genus Aspergillus consists of a large number of species, the most important of them being 
Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus japonicas, Aspergillus nid-
ulans, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus (de Vries and Visser, 2001; Knuf and Nielsen, 2012). 
Aspergillus are saprotrophic fungi with a high tolerance to a wide range of pH, making them suitable for 
growing on a broad spectrum of substrates. Aspergillus species synthesize enzymes, including several 
hydrolytic enzymes useful for the polysaccharide decomposition of plant cell wall. Therefore, good 
fermentation capabilities and high levels of protein secretion are characteristics that make them ideal 
organisms for industrial applications (de Vries and Visser, 2001; Stroparo et al., 2012; Ward et al., 2005).
In particular, A. niger has been widely studied and employed in biotechnological processes due 
to its considerable extracellular enzyme production using different agricultural and food industry 
FIGURE 10.1

Chapter 10  USE OF ASPERGILLUS NIGER EXTRACTS
wastes (wheat bran, soybean bran, barley bran, rice straw, corn cob, apple pomace, orange peel, mango  
residue, sugarcane bagasse, oil, and wine residues) as substrates. In recent years, several scientific 
works have corroborated and supported the importance of A. niger for the production of xylanases  
(Ahmad et al., 2012b; Bakri et al., 2008; Benedetti et al., 2013; de Alencar Guimaraes et al., 2013; 
Dhillon et al., 2012; Dobrev et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2009; Okafor et al., 2007; Pal and Khanum, 2010; 
Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2013), and for obtaining other lignocellulosic enzymes 
such as cellulase, β-glucosidase, pectinase, or feruloyl esterase (Bansal et  al., 2012; Hegde and 
Muralikrishna, 2009; Mamma et al., 2008; Ou et al., 2011; Rodríguez-Zúñiga et al., 2014; Sánchez, 
2009; Vitcosque et al., 2012).
On an industrial scale, xylanases are produced mainly by Aspergillus species (de Alencar Guimaraes 
et al., 2013; de Vries and Visser, 2001; Shekiro et al., 2012; Yoon et al., 2006). Among the Aspergillus 
genus, there are many species that are used to produce xylanases, including A. niger (Ahmad et al., 
2012a,b; Bakri et al., 2008; Benedetti et al., 2013; de Alencar Guimaraes et al., 2013; de Vries and 
Visser, 2001; Dobrev et al., 2007; Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014).
10.6  CORN COB AS A CARBON SOURCE FOR XYLANASE  
PRODUCTION BY A. NIGER
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, maize was the second most 
produced crop in the world in 2013, with a total production of 1.02 × 109 tons, preceded by sugarcane 
(1.88 × 109 tons) and followed by other important cereal crops, mainly rice (7.46 × 108 tons) and wheat 
(7.13 × 108 tons). The xylan content of corn cob is approximately 35% (Aachary and Prapulla, 2009). 
Corn cob xylan can be separated into two different structural types. One is a low-branched arabino-
glucuronoxylan, which is mostly water insoluble, and the second is a highly branched, water-soluble 
heteroxylan. These two xylan structural types can be distinguished by the amount and proportion of non-
regularly distributed side chains. These are mainly single α-(1→2)-linked 4-O-methyl-d-glucopyranosyl 
uronic acid units and α-(1→3)-linked l-arabinofuranose residues, as well as 2-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl-
α-l-arabinofuranose. Thus, the difference is mainly due to the content of arabinose and uronic acid, 
both of which are higher in the water-soluble fraction (Ebringerová et al., 1992). To sum up, due to the 
notable percentage that corn cob makes up as a by-product of maize processing, the high worldwide 
production of this cereal and corn cob’s notable xylan composition clearly indicate the potential utiliza-
tion of corn cob substrate for fungal growth as well as xylanase and xylose production.
Corn cobs were found to be the best substrates for high yield of xylanases with poor cellulase produc-
tion (Shah and Madamwar, 2005), so various authors have assayed corn cob as substrate for the synthesis 
of xylanases by A. niger (Ahmad et al., 2012b; Bakri et al., 2008; Benedetti et al., 2013; Dobrev et al., 
2007; Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014; Ximenes et al., 2007). For instance, Bakri et al. (2008) evaluated the 
production of xylanases by A. niger SS7 using a submerged culture with a basal medium (yeast extract 
2.0 g/L, peptone 2.0 g/L, K2HPO4 1.5 g/L, MgSO4·7H2O 0.5 g/L) supplemented with various agricul-
ture residues (barley straw, wheat straw, wheat bran, corn hulls, olives pulp, apple pulp, and sawdust). 
Corn cob hulls were considered the best agricultural residue among all the studied wastes, obtaining a 
maximum of 293.82 U/mL after 5 days at 30°C, pH 7.0, 120 rpm, and 3.0% concentration of corn cob. 
Similarly, Benedetti et al. (2013) assayed the production of xylanases by A. niger FCUP1 in a medium 
made up of 0.1% CaCO3, 0.5% NaCl, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.5% corn steep liquor, and 1% of different residues 

179
10.6  CORN COB AS A CARBON SOURCE FOR XYLANASE PRODUCTION
as carbon source (corn cob, sugarcane bagasse, wheat bran, and soy husks) at 40°C for 16 h, and proved 
that powdered corn cob was an excellent inducer for the A. niger xylanolytic complex.
Likewise, Ahmad et al. (2012b) tested the synthesis of xylanases by A. niger on three different 
concentration levels of corn cob (2.5%, 3.0%, and 3.5%), using four different pH levels (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 
and 6.5) and four incubation temperatures (25.0°C, 27.5°C, 30.0°C, and 32.5°C). The highest xylanase 
activity (60.03 ± 1.83 IU/mL) was achieved at 30°C, pH 5.5, 3.0% concentration of corn cob, and an 
incubation period of 72 h. Meanwhile, Dobrev et al. (2007) optimized the composition of nutrients 
added to the culture broth ((NH4)2HPO4 2.6 g/L, urea 0.9 g/L, malt sprout 6.0 g/L, corn cob 24.0 g/L, 
and wheat bran 14.6 g/L), increasing by 33% the xylanase activity of xylanases secreted by A. niger 
B03 (996.30 U/mL) in comparison to the activity obtained with the basic medium, all in a submerged 
culture (Dobrev et al., 2007).
On the other hand, Pérez-Rodríguez et al. (2014) optimized the production of xylanases in solid-
state culture by A. niger CECT 2700, enhancing the amount of xylanases from 504 ± 7 U/g dry corn 
cob (using the nonoptimized culture broth) to up to 2452.7 U/g dry corn cob after improving the opera-
tional conditions and supplementing the nutrients (corn cob without pretreatments moistened in a ratio 
1:3.6 (w/v) with a solution containing 5.0 g/L NaNO3, 1.3 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 4.5 g/L KH2PO4, and 3 g/L 
yeast extract, after 8 days of fermentation at 30°C in Erlenmeyer flasks). This study was complemented 
by the scale-up of xylanase production, where the effects of various air flows was assayed. Successful 
results were achieved in a laboratory-scale horizontal tube bioreactor, reaching highest xylanase activ-
ity (2926 U/g dry corn cob) at a flow rate of 0.2 L/min.
Taking into account that substrates should not only provide nutrients for fungi but also support, 
facilitate microbial attachment, and allow oxygen transfer and heat dispersion among other condi-
tions, various pretreatments have been investigated to improve the use of corn cob as a substrate for 
fungal xylanase production under SSF. Pretreatments of lignocellulosic substrates can modify the 
physical structure of lignin, increase the available surface area and pore size (Figure 10.2), cause

partial depolymerization of hemicellulose, reduce the crystallinity of cellulose and lead to deacet-
ylation of hemicellulose (Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014; Shah and Madamwar, 2005). Ferreira et al. 
(1999) evaluated the production of xylanase and β-xylosidase by Aspergillus tamarii in solid-state 
culture using corn cob subjected to three different pretreatments: alkali treatment (adding 1 mL of 0.3 N 
NaOH per g substrate), hydrogen peroxide containing MnSO4 treatment, and heating (121°C for 1 h). 
However, they concluded that neither alkali, hydrogen peroxide, nor heat treatment of corn cob caused 
further improvements in enzyme production. In like manner, corn cob was enzymatically treated to 
remove the starch, pretreated with alkali (sodium hydroxide or ammonia solution), or subjected to 
physical pretreatments with autoclave and microwave by Pérez-Rodríguez et al. (2014) to assay xyla-
nase production by A. niger CECT 2700. These treatments did not improve xylanase production,  
giving in all cases lower values compared to those obtained using the raw material. 
Similar results were obtained by Rahnama et  al. (2013) working with untreated and alkali- 
pretreated rice straw. They justified that their best results regarding cellulase and xylanase production 
and those reported by researchers using untreated substrates could be related to the overall complexity 
of the untreated matrix, that could impact and induce greater enzyme production. Considering also the 
higher energy consumption and the additional economic costs related to the application of pretreat-
ments, untreated corn cob appears to be the most environmentally friendly and sustainable technology 
for xylanolytic enzyme production by A. niger (Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014).
10.7  INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION OF FUNGAL XYLANASES
Fungal xylanases have gained importance in recent years due to their biotechnological application in 
diverse sectors such as paper, pulp, food, and animal feed industries, as well as for bioconversion of 
lignocellulosic waste into value-added compounds and to fermentative products (de Vries and Visser, 
2001; Juturu and Wu, 2012; Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014; Polizeli et al., 2005).
In the pulp and paper industry enzymatic degradation focuses on the hemicellulose-lignin com-
plexes, where the cellulose fibers are still intact and strong. Endoxylanase is the most remarkable 
enzyme used in bio-bleaching of kraft pulps. Nevertheless, the addition of other xylanolytic enzymes 
has also been shown to be effective (de Vries and Visser, 2001). Xylanolytic enzyme preparations lack-
ing in cellulase can be of great value in the bio-bleaching of pulps, thus reducing the amount of bleach-
ing chemicals, such as chlorine, and the mechanical methods required in the pretreatment of paper pulp. 
As a result, the cost of the process is decreased because of the diminution in the use of chemicals and 
energy consumption and the environmental impact of the paper and pulp industries is reduced since the 
pollution caused by the use of chlorine and toxic discharges is diminished (de Vries and Visser, 2001; 
Collins et al., 2005). Various studies describing the use for pulp bio-bleaching of cellulase-free xyla-
nases produced by different Aspergillus species such as terricola, ochraceus, niger, niveus, and oryzae 
reflected the potential of these enzymes for this application (Szendefy et al., 2006; Betini et al., 2009; 
Michelin et al., 2010).
A second area in which xylanases find application is represented by the food and beverage indus-
tries. Products obtained microbiologically or enzymatically have been regarded as a GRAS (generally 
recognized as safe) status by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). This regulation allows 
industries to use A. niger products in food and feed applications (Knuf and Nielsen, 2012), which 

181
10.7  Industrial Application of Fungal Xylanases
yields an advantage in comparison to chemical and physicochemical procedures. Xylanolytic enzyme 
preparations are widely used in the production of bakery goods, coffee, starch, plant oil, and juice 
(Harris and Ramalingam, 2010). In the bakery industry, xylanases improve the elasticity and strength 
of the dough as a consequence of the arabinoxylan fraction. Thus, xylanolytic hydrolysis enables eas-
ier handling and larger loaf volumes, enhances bread texture, and improves dough quality (Collins 
et al., 2005; de Vries and Visser, 2001). Aspergillus xylanases, and especially A. niger xylanases, have 
shown interesting abilities for improving dough and bread quality attributes (Ahmad et al., 2012a; Shah 
et al., 2006; Romanowska et al., 2006; Camacho and Aguilar, 2003). Xylanases are also used in cof-
fee extraction and in the preparation of instant coffee. The solubilization of cellulose, galactomannan, 
arabinogalactan, and xylan determines the yield of soluble solids used for the final products and their 
organoleptic characteristics. Thus, xylanolytic enzymes influence the properties of the coffee beverage 
(Jooste et al., 2013).
Arabinoxylans are cereal grain polysaccharides that appear in relatively small amounts. However, 
the unique physicochemical properties of arabinoxylans give them an outstanding significance, 
affecting grain functionality in biotechnological cereal-based processes such as separation of wheat 
flour into gluten and starch. The addition of xylanases to wheat flour changes the gluten agglom-
eration behavior during gluten–starch separation (Dornez et al., 2009). Hemicellulases have a con-
siderable effect on the viscosity of the dough depending on their specificity toward the soluble and 
insoluble fractions of the polysaccharide and their dosage (Frederix et al., 2003). Low viscosity 
increases the mobility of the components during the batter stage and improves the rate of gluten 
agglomeration. Hence, an enzyme blend containing xylanases with selectivity toward water-extracta-
ble arabinoxylan or a high concentration mixture of both xylanases active with soluble and insoluble 
arabinoxylan improves gluten agglomeration behavior, starch yield, gluten–starch separation, and 
the global efficiency of cereal-based processes (Dornez et al., 2009). Studies using Aspergillus acu-
leatus xylanase with selectivity toward water-extractable arabinoxylan and no inhibition by wheat 
flour xylanase inhibitors, and Bacillus subtilis xylanase with selectivity toward water-unextractable 
arabinoxylan and inhibition by wheat flour xylanase inhibitors, have shown the better performance of 
the Aspergillus enzyme on gluten separation and the convenience of applying both enzymes together 
at high dosages to even further improve the process (Frederix et al., 2003). In fruit and vegetable pro-
cessing, including juice, oil, brewing, and wine production, xylanases enhance extraction yield and 
filtration process performance, increasing must filterability and reducing final turbidity. Xylanases, 
acting in conjunction with other enzymes, yield improvements in consistency and palatability of 
drinks as well as increasing the recovery of essential oils, vitamins, mineral salts, and edible dyes 
or pigments from fruits and vegetables (Harris and Ramalingam, 2010), a necessity for processing 
industries.
Other applications in which xylanolytic enzymes are used include increasing feedstock nutritive 
value, digestibility, and conversion efficiency by cattle. Arabinoxylans are one of the major nonstarch 
polysaccharide fractions present in agricultural silage and grain feed. Arabinoxylans create a physical 
barrier to nutrient digestion and absorption by increasing gut viscosity, thus interfering in reducing 
the digestibility and assimilation of nutrients. The previously mentioned polysaccharides also pro-
duce an alteration in the secretion of endogenous digestive enzymes, water, and electrolytes, modi-
fying the digestive tract functions and modulating gut microbiota (Zhang et al., 2014a). Addition of 
xylanases to feed enhances digestibility by leading to a decrease of digesta viscosity, an increase in 

182
Chapter 10  USE OF ASPERGILLUS NIGER EXTRACTS
the release of the enclosed nutrients from cell wall polysaccharides, and an improvement in protein 
and starch utilization. Nourishing diets containing feed treated with a cocktail of hydrolytic enzymes 
(mainly cellulase and xylanase, with or without feruloyl esterases) release monosaccharides due to two 
principal reasons: the breakdown of nonstarch polysaccharides and the release of their constituent 
monomers, and the subsequently release of the starch within the endosperm of grains exposed to the 
endogenous amylase, releasing more glucose. Thereby, ruminant feed enzyme additives boost animal 
growth performance and body weight gain, milk yield, and milk composition of dairy animals without 
changing feed intake (Dhiman et al., 2002; Phakachoed et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014a). Moreover, 
the enzyme supplementation of feed has a positive collateral impact on the environment because of 
the reduction of undesirable residues in excrements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, copper, and zinc, 
thus decreasing environmental pollution (Harris and Ramalingam, 2010; Polizeli et al., 2005). Crude 
xylanase from A. niger has been successfully assayed in pig diets, improving the in vitro feed digest-
ibility and the average daily gain, as well as reducing the incidence of diarrhea (Tapingkae et al., 2008).  
A xylanase produced by a genetically modified A. niger was also assayed for chicken feeding, and good 
results were obtained for growth, which were related to the positive effect of the enzyme on digestion, 
absorption, metabolism, and immunity (Gao et al., 2007).
As an interesting alternative to the development and use of first-generation bioethanol obtained 
by fermentation of sugar and starchy materials, which has generated considerable controversy due to 
the competition between food or feed and fuel production, second-generation bioethanol produced 
from lignocellulosic biomass has emerged as an alternative renewable energy source to fuel petroleum. 
Agroindustrial wastes of a lignocellulosic nature are a good option to be used as raw materials for this 
purpose (Matsushika et al., 2009; Viikari et al., 2012). The conversion includes two steps: hydrolysis of 
cellulose in the lignocellulosic materials to fermentable reducing sugars, and fermentation of the sugars 
to ethanol. Bioconversion of the hemicelluloses by xylanases helps to achieve a reasonable commercial 
price for bioethanol by enhancing hydrolysis in two ways. On the one hand, xylanases and other hemi-
cellulases expose the cellulose fibers to cellulase action, facilitating hydrolysis, and, on the other hand, 
releasing fermentable sugars from the hemicellulosic fraction. Regarding this, it must be considered that 
pentoses (mainly xylose and arabinose) account for the majority of hemicellulose monomers and that 
there are a limited number of microorganisms able to use xylose or arabinose (Kumar and Wyman, 2009),  
which do not include the Saccharomyces species usually employed for bioethanol fermentation  
(Hahn-Hägerdal et al., 2006). Because of this, great effort has been made in recent years to find wild 
or transformed efficient pentose-fermenting yeasts. In this way, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellu-
lose and hemicellulose, which comprise up two-thirds of lignocellulosic materials (Gírio et al., 2010), 
results in sugar-rich liquid streams useful for the biological production of fuel ethanol, reducing the 
demand for and dependence on petroleum, mitigating global warming by reducing the amounts of 
greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and also achieving at the same time an acceptable dis-
posal of industrial residues (Matsushika et al., 2009; Viikari et al., 2012). The use of an A. nidulans 
endoxylanase in combination with a commercial cellulase preparation has allowed an improvement of 
more than 28% in ethanol production from wheat straw by a xylose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevi-
siae strain (Alvira et al., 2011). In the case of A. niger, the particular ability of this fungus to produce 
significant levels of feruloyl esterase together with xylanases makes A. niger enzymatic extracts very 
suitable for this purpose, since xylan hydrolysis is synergistically enhanced by the previous cleavage of 
the ferulic side chains (Tabka et al., 2006).

10.8  CORN COB FOR XYLOOLIGOSACCHARIDES-XYLOSE PRODUCTION
10.8  CORN COB AS SUBSTRATE FOR THE ENZYMATIC PRODUCTION  
OF XYLOOLIGOSACCHARIDES AND XYLOSE
Xylooligosaccharides are getting increasing attention as functional food ingredients with beneficial 
properties for gastrointestinal health by their prebiotic action, increasing enteric microbiota stabil-
ity. Some studies have found that these sugars may reduce the risk of colon cancer and suppress 
blood cholesterol levels, and are also capable of improving diabetic symptoms (Khandeparker and 
Numan, 2008). Consequently, xylooligosaccharides have proved to have potential uses in various fields 
including pharmaceuticals, feed formulations, and agricultural and food applications (de Vries and  
Visser, 2001; Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014).
Xylooligosaccharides are produced from corn cob by several methods, including hydrother-
mal treatment, chemical (acid) hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, or a combination of these methods 
(Chapla et al., 2012). Nevertheless, enzymatic hydrolysis is attractive because it does not produce 
undesirable by-products, generates less production of monosaccharides, and does not require special 
equipment (Chapla et al., 2012). Fungal xylanases are the preferred catalysts for the hydrolysis of 
xylan, mainly due to their higher specificity, milder reaction conditions, and negligible substrate losses 
(Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014). Xylanases release xylooligomers, xylobiose, and xylose. The main 
drawback of the enzymatic production of xylooligosaccharides is the accessibility of the enzymes to 
the substrate inside the lignocellulosic matrix. One method involves the extraction of xylan prior to the 
hydrolysis step. Chapla et al. (2012) carried out four different extraction protocols in order to recover 
the maximum amount of xylan from raw corn cobs. Treatments with sulfuric acid, sodium hypochlorite 
solution, sodium hydroxide, and autohydrolysis were applied. The best yield in corn cob xylan extrac-
tion (178.73 ± 5.8 g of xylan/kg of corn cob) was achieved using a mild alkali treatment. A partially 
purified xylanase from Aspergillus foetidus MTCC 4898 was used for the selective enzymatic produc-
tion of xylooligosaccharides. Maximum production of xylooligosaccharides was 6.73 ± 0.23 mg/mL 
after 8 h of reaction time using 20 U of xylanase at a temperature of 45°C (Chapla et al., 2012).
An interesting method involves the application of different pretreatments to the lignocellulosic 
matrix for the purpose of making corn cob xylan more accessible for the enzymatic reaction instead 
of the complete extraction of xylan as substrate (Aachary and Prapulla, 2009). Aachary and Prapulla 
(2009) tested various pretreatment methods to evaluate the efficiency of xylooligosaccharide produc-
tion of alkali- and acid-pretreated powdered corn cob and the combination of corn cob that was acid 
treated and cooked under pressure in xylooligosaccharide production. Compared with the xylan content 
of native corn cob (31.9 ± 2.3%), alkali-pretreated, acid-pretreated, and pressure-cooked corn cob pow-
der showed greater percentages of xylan (40.8 ± 1.2%, 39.2 ± 1.1%, and 40.0 ± 0.8%, respectively). 
As a result, alkali pretreatment was found to be more efficient for xylooligosaccharide production.  
In the release of xylooligosaccharides studies, 200 U of endoxylanase (Bioxyl P40) per gram of mate-
rial was employed. The percentage of xylooligosaccharides obtained by the enzymatic hydrolysis of 
raw corn cob was 89 ± 1.1%, whereas 81 ± 1.5%, 77 ± 1.8%, and 52 ± 3.2% of xylooligosaccharides 
were obtained by the enzymatic hydrolysis of alkali-pretreated, steam-cooked corn cob powder and 
acid pretreatment. Considering the percentages of both xylan and xylooligosaccharides released by 
endoxylanase Bioxyl P40, the alkali-pretreatment was the most efficient method, providing the highest 
xylooligosaccharides production (equivalent to 5.8 ± 0.14 mg/mL).

184
Chapter 10  USE OF ASPERGILLUS NIGER EXTRACTS
Zhu et al. (2006) also used pretreated corn cob as substrate for enzymatic release of xylooligosac-
charides. Corn cob was pretreated in aqueous ammonia (15% ammonia, 60°C, L/S 2.8, and 48 h), 
which generated a delignified and xylan-rich substrate. Subsequently, both untreated and treated corn 
cobs were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using endoxylanase X2753 for production of xylooligo-
saccharides. Aqueous ammonia treatment of corn cobs yielded a superior substrate for saccharification 
(15.74 mg/mL) compared with untreated corn cob (4.11 mg/mL), with a total molar yield of 80.5% of 
xylan. Moreover, Zhu et al. (2006) studied corn stover as well as corn cob; they concluded that corn 
cobs are a more suitable feedstock than corn stover for xylooligosaccharide production, since corn cob 
has higher xylan content and greater bulk density.
A combined deacetylation and laboratory beating of pulp with a PFI mill as refining pretreatment 
was applied to corn cob by Zhang et al. (2014b) for the enhancement of a two-step enzymatic hydroly-
sis of both hemicellulose and cellulose to xylooligosaccharides and glucose, respectively. In the first 
step, the pretreated corn cob was hydrolyzed by xylanase (Habio Enzyme) to produce xylooligosac-
charides. Further hydrolysis of the solid residue isolated from the first step was carried out by cellulase 
(Celluclast 1.5 L) and β-glucosidase (Novozyme 188). In deacetylation pretreatment, two weak bases, 
Na2CO3 and Ca(OH)2, and one strong base, NaOH, were tested to remove acetyl groups. To further 
increase enzymatic digestibility, the deacetylated and washed corn cob was milled using a PFI mill, 
which applied a great proportion of compressive to shear forces on the corn cob. According to this work, 
the most suitable alkali for deacetylation of corn cob was Ca(OH)2. It was also found that increasing the 
charge of the alkali the percentage of enzymatic hydrolysis and sugar yields were improved. Finally, 
86.8% of xylan and 86.1% of glucan in the raw corn cob were hydrolyzed in the two-stage enzymatic 
hydrolysis with the combined refining pretreatments of deacetylation and PFI. The same authors also 
suggested that corn cob could be highly enzymatically hydrolyzed after mild deacetylation treatment 
compared to other cellulosic materials (such as corn stover and aspen wood).
Xylose is the final product of the complete hydrolysis of the xylan chain. It has applications in the 
food industry as a noncariogenic light sweetener, and it is the precursor for the biotechnological produc-
tion of xylitol, which is based on the fermentation of xylose from the hemicellulosic fraction of agroin-
dustrial wastes into xylitol by microorganisms (mainly yeasts) (Parajó et al., 1998; Rivas et al., 2006; 
Silva et al., 2007). Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol with sweetness similar to that of sucrose, which 
has many advantages as a food ingredient. It has anticariogenic properties, inhibiting the growth of oral 
bacteria and so reducing plaque formation and preventing caries. This polyol has a lower energy value 
than sucrose, so xylitol can be supplied in the diet, perhaps limiting the tendency to obesity. Xylitol can 
be used in diabetic food formulations because, with fructose, it is not insulin-mediated, which causes 
only limited increases in glucose and insulin blood levels. The incorporation of xylitol in formula-
tions can reduce darkening and preserve the nutritional value of proteins because it does not undergo 
the Maillard reaction, and also produces an enhancement of color and taste without causing changes 
in properties during storage (Parajó et al., 1998; Rivas et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2005; Su et al., 2013).  
Due to all the mentioned desirable properties and vast potential uses of xylitol, industries are com-
mitted to xylitol incorporation as an ingredient in drugs, food, and dental products among others  
(Parajó et al., 1998; Rivas et al., 2006).
The generation of monomeric xylose by enzymatic processes using xylan from corn cob as sub-
strate and A. niger xylanases as catalysts, was reported by Yoon et al. (2006). These authors evaluated 
three commercial xylanase preparations (Rapidase Pomaliqan (Gist-Brocades International), Clarex 
ML (Genenor), and Validase (Valley Research)) in the enzymatic production of pentoses and xylooli-
gosaccharides from the hemicellulose fraction of corn husk and corn cob. Rapidase Pomaliqan enzyme

10.9  Conclusions
preparation (1941 U/mL xylanase), derived from A. niger and Trichoderma reesei, was capable of 
increasing the concentration of sugars from an initial value of 106.5 to 210.6 g/kg dry matter corn husk 
and of 8.6 to 141.6 g/kg dry matter of corn cob, respectively, under favorable conditions (480 min of 
reaction at pH 5.0 and 50°C). Referring strictly to xylose, 83.7 ± 8.3 g/kg of dry matter from corn husks 
and 31.1 ± 6.1 g/kg of dry matter from corn cob were achieved using Rapidase Pomaliqan. Yields, 
including arabinose, xylose, xylobiose, and xylotriose, from the hemicellulose fraction of corn husks 
and corn cob with Rapidase Pomaliq xylanase were 75.2% and 65.6%, respectively.
However, the most common studies have been focused on the pretreatment of lignocellulosic mate-
rials in order to heighten xylose release. There are a large number of possible pretreatments (Banerjee 
et al., 2010). An effective pretreatment is characterized by several criteria. It must avoid the need for 
reducing the size of biomass particles, preserve the pentose (hemicellulose) fractions, limit formation 
of degradation products that inhibit growth of fermentative microorganisms, minimize energy demand, 
and limit cost (Mosier et al., 2005). For instance, Ximenes et al. (2007) employed corn spent from etha-
nol production, either used as delivered from the industry (untreated) or after being pretreated with hot 
water, and two fungal strains (Trichoderma reesei Rut C-30 and A. niger NRRL 2001) to first produce 
xylanases. Aspergillus niger NRRL 2001 secreted a maximum amount of xylanases (72.21 IU/mL) at 
28°C after 132 h in flasks, thus improving the production after 264 h in a 4-L bioreactor (64.31 IU/mL).  
Then they evaluated the hydrolysis of xylan from corn waste pretreated with hot water to xylose. 
Although A. niger enzymes released more xylose (64%) compared to T. reesei (48%), when added 
separately, the mixture of T. reesei and A. niger enzymes increased the xylose content up to 71%. 
Weijuna et al. (2010) optimized alkali liquor pretreatment conditions of corn cob to remove lignin and 
improve the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of hemicellulose and cellulose. Under the optimal pretreatment 
conditions obtained (reaction time 12 h, temperature 70°C, liquid to solid ratio 23:1, aqueous ammonia 
concentration 2.5%(w/v), hydrogen peroxide 0.6%, sodium silicate 5%, magnesium sulfate 0.05% in 
reaction mixture), the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicellulose, cellulose, and corn cob residue 
was 41.36%, 88.09%, and 69.21%, respectively, by two steps of hydrolysis (xylanase and cellulose). 
These results mean an increase in hydrolysis yield compared with the untreated materials.
10.9  CONCLUSIONS
Lignocellulosic residues, such as corn cob, generated from agricultural activities and food or feed 
industries represent an inexpensive natural resource for fungal growth and production of enzymes or 
value-added compounds. Considering that the enzyme production cost is one of the main factors in 
determining the economic efficiency of a biotechnological process (Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2014), its 
reduction by optimizing the fermentation substrates by incorporating lignocellulosic wastes as a carbon 
source must be a serious objective for industrial applications. SSF is an optimal method for waste val-
orization processes based on fungal culture. Considering the ability of several fungi to produce a broad 
spectrum of complementary and synergic enzymes, and taking into account that in many cases their 
regulatory mechanisms of gene expression are coordinated (de Vries et al., 2000), it is reasonable that 
the mixture of enzymes produced from a specific substrate could be the most appropriate for hydrolyz-
ing it. Therefore, the use of the same substrate for fungal xylanase production and for enzymatic release 
of xylose and xylooligosaccharide seems to be an interesting methodology. Consequently, corn cob can 
be considered potentially recoverable as a raw material for a broad number of applications in industrial 
biotechnology processes.

11.1  INTRODUCTION
Volvariella volvacea, also known as the Chinese mushroom or straw mushroom, is an edible fungal 
species grown in tropical and subtropical regions. In the eighteenth century, Buddhist monks of Nanhua 
Temple located in the Chinese province of Guangdong, developed a primitive method of cultivating 
the straw mushroom to enrich their diet. Subsequently, V. volvacea was presented as tribute to China’s 
royalty (Chang, 1969, 1977).
Although V. volvacea has been cultivated for approximately 300 years, there are still many associ-
ated production problems that greatly restrict the commercial exploitation of this mushroom. Mushroom 
yields in proportion to the dry weight of compost at spawning (biological efficiency) are only ~15% 
for straw substrates and 40% for cotton-waste “composts” (Chang, 1980), which are very low values 
compared with many of the other major cultivated edible mushroom species such as Agaricus bispo-
rus, Lentinula edodes, and Pleurotus spp. (Chang, 1974). V. volvacea is also very sensitive to low 
temperatures, and the fungal mycelium will lose viability when exposed to temperatures below 15°C. 
Furthermore, mushroom fruit bodies suffer chilling damage and undergo autolysis when stored at low 
temperatures (4°C) (Chang, 1978), thereby restricting their shelf life.
V. volvacea is generally recognized as a primary homothallic Basidiomycete (Chang, 1969; Chang 
and Chu, 1969; Chang and Yan, 1971), although some single spore isolates are self-fertile (heterokary-
otic) while others are self-sterile (homokaryotic) (Chiu and Moore, 1999). The heterokaryotic isolates 
complete the sexual cycle without mating, but homokaryotic isolates convert to the dikaryotic form 
with mating (Figure 11.1). Moreover, V. volvacea hyphae are multinucleate (Chang and Ling, 1970)  
and do not form clamp connections, which, in other fungi, serve as morphological markers to distin-
guish self-fertile from self-sterile mycelia (Chang, 1983). These traits are problematic for the develop-
ment of a simple and efficient method for V. volvacea cross-breeding.
The sequencing of the genome of the monokaryotic V. volvacea strain V23-1 has been completed 
(Bao et al., 2013). These data will facilitate elucidation of the reproductive issues of the mushroom.

Chapter 11  V. VOLVACEA: IDENTIFICATION AND APPLICATION 
The molecular genetic structure of the mating type locus and phylogenetic analysis of the mating type 
gene of V. volvacea will be helpful in identifying the sexual pattern of V. volvacea accurately, and also 
in finding the proper molecular markers for cross-breeding.
11.2  THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE V. VOLVACEA GENOME
The V. volvacea whole genome sequence was assembled into 62 scaffolds with an N50 of 388 kb and 
a total size of 35.7 Mb, determined using combined Roche 454 GS FLX sequencing and Illumina 
Solexa sequencing (Bao et al., 2013) (Table 11.1). The size of the V. volvacea genome is similar to the 
genomes of several other species assigned to Agaricaceae, including Schizophyllum commune (38.5 M) 
FIGURE 11.1
Life cycle and the fruiting body of Volvariella volvacea. (A) Basidiospores of V. volvacea are in tetrad and 
attached to a basidium by four sterigmata. Mature basidiospore germinates under favorable conditions to form 
primary mycelium. Secondary mycelia form by the fusion of primary mycelia, and give rise to fruiting bodies, 
which create another new generation of basidiospore. The fruiting mycelium has no clamp connections. The 
life cycle of V. volvacea in general is complete in 4–5 weeks. (B) “Button” stages in the development of

11.3  MATING TYPE LOCI AND MATING TYPE GENES OF V. VOLVACEA
(Ohm et al., 2010), Coprinopsis cinerea (37 M) (Stajich et al., 2010), and Pleurotus ostreatus (35 M) 
(Ramírez et al., 2011), but is bigger than that of another straw rotting fungus, A. bisporus (30.2 M) 
(Morin et al., 2012). Annotation of the assembled genome sequence generated 11,084 gene models, 
76.43% of which were supported by EST data. The average transcript length was 1572 bp, with an 
average of six introns per multiexon gene. The average exon and intron sizes were 252.3 and 83.2 bp, 
respectively (Bao et al., 2013) (Table 11.1).
The data of the V. volvacea whole genome sequence have been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) under the accession number AMXZ01000000, and also at JGI (http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/).
11.3  MATING TYPE LOCI AND MATING TYPE GENES OF V. VOLVACEA
In the genome sequence of the single spore-derived V. volvacea, strain V23-1, the homologous 
gene scanning revealed two homeodomain (HD) genes, VVO_04854 and VVO_05004 (designated  
vv-HD1-A1-V23-1 and vv-HD2-A1-V23-1), located 271 bp apart on scaffold 07 (Bao et  al., 2013). Both 
encoded HD proteins have a high similarity with homologs from the bipolar Basidiomycetes  
Pholiota microspora (P. nameko) and the tetrapolar Basidiomycetes C. cinerea and S. commune. We sug-
gested that V. volvacea has one A mating type locus containing HD1 and HD2 genes. Subsequently, we 
identified a pair of genes, vv-HD1-A2-V23-18 and vv-HD2-A2-V23-18 (accession number: JX157875), within 
the A2 locus of another single spore-derived V. volvacea, strain V23-18, which is compatible with strain 
V23-1. The encoded HD1 and HD2 proteins from the spore monokaryons V23-1 and V23-18 showed 
48% and 49% similarity, respectively (Bao et al., 2013). Studies on the molecular genetic structure  
of mating type A locus of V. volvacea showed that the flanking genes of the A mating type locus are  
the mip gene (coding mitochondrial intermediate peptidase, MIP) and β-fg gene (Bao et al., 2013) 
(Figure 11.2), which has highly conserved synteny with other Basidiomycetes, such as C. cinerea 
(Brown and Casselton, 2001), P. djamor (James et  al., 2004), Coprinellus disseminates (James 
et  al., 2006), Phanerochaete chrysosporium (James et  al., 2011), P. microspora (P. nameko)  
(Yi et al., 2009), and Postia placenta (Martinez et al., 2009).

Chapter 11  V. VOLVACEA: IDENTIFICATION AND APPLICATION 
We also found three pheromone-receptor-like genes (named vv-rcb1, vv-rcb2, and vv-rcb3) on scaffold 
24 by blasting homologs in the V. volvacea genome, which are 72 and 4 kb apart, respectively (Bao et al., 
2013). The deduced protein sequences of vv-rcb1, vv-rcb2, and vv-rcb3 genes all have the seven-transmem-
brane structure, which is a classic trait of the pheromone receptor at mating type B locus of Basidiomycetes, 
and have high similarity with other pheromone receptors. We suggested V. volvacea also has a B mating 
type locus. But the B mating type locus of V. volvacea shows poorly conserved synteny with those of other 
Basidiomycetes. The genes encoding pheromone precursor, which is necessary for the function of B mat-
ing factor, failed to be found at the flanking region of the vv-rcb1, vv-rcb2, and vv-rcb3 genes. Another 
three pheromone-receptor-like genes obtained from the B mating type locus of strain V23-18 by specific 
primes shared completely identical DNA sequences with that of strain V23-1. These results suggested that 
pheromone-receptor-like genes in V. volvacea might not regulate mating compatibility, which is the same 
as those in bipolar fungi C. disseminatus (James et al., 2006) and P. nameko (Yi et al., 2009).
Mating compatibility, leading to heterokaryosis and fruiting, exists only between homokaryotic 
mycelia carrying different mating type genes and is the basis for cross-breeding. The V. volvacea whole 
genome has greatly increased our understanding of the mating type system operative in this mushroom. 
V. volvacea strains V23-1 and V23-18 have the compatible bipolar mating type alleles A1 and A2, 
respectively, each of which consists of a pair of mating type genes HD1 and HD2, demonstrating the 
possibility of mating between homokaryotic hyphae. And the sequences of mating type genes HD1 and 
HD2 between strains V23-1 and V23-18 have been shown to be different, which provides the basis to 
design the molecular markers.
11.4  SETTING THE MOLECULAR MARKER-ASSISTED BREEDING  
TECHNIQUES OF V. VOLVACEA
V. volvacea have two kinds of single spore isolates: self-fertile (heterokaryotic) isolates and self-sterile 
(homokaryotic) isolates (Chiu and Moore, 1999). To date, many features relating to the sexual pattern of 
V. volvacea remain unclear, such as the origin of heterokaryotic isolates and the mechanism(s) involved 
in generating genetic variation among progeny; but the existence of the homokaryotic isolates raises the 
possibility of using self-sterile isolates as the crossing parent strains to create strains with desirable traits. 
However, due to the absence of clamp connections in heterokaryotic hyphae, it is problematic to simply

11.4  SETTING THE MOLECULAR MARKER-ASSISTED BREEDING TECHNIQUES
and quickly identify the homokaryotic isolates from the heterokaryotic isolates according to morpho-
logical differentiations. Nevertheless, the identification of cross-bred V. volvacea hybrids (homokaryon 
× homokaryon crosses) has been reported using molecular screening based on RAPD, SRAP, ISSR, and 
SCAR markers (Chen, 2006; Li, 2008; Fu et al., 2010; Zhao, 2011). However, since compatible pair-
ings between homokaryotic isolates are controlled by mating type locus, it should be possible to resolve 
the above-mentioned problem by using the mating type genes as the molecular markers. Guided by this 
information, we have identified homokaryotic, heterokaryotic, and cross-bred strains of V. volvacea using 
mating type molecular markers as auxiliary molecular markers, and established that the molecular marker-
assisted cross-breeding technique represents a practical and highly efficient system for generating improved  
V. volvacea varieties with desirable characteristics. The technique consists of a series of sequential steps 
involving the separation of single spore isolates, cloning the mating type gene, designing the PCR prim-
ers for amplifying the mating type genes, marker-assisted identification of homokaryons, cross-breeding 
between pairs of homokaryons, marker-assisted identification of hybrids, cultivation experiments, and 
marker-assisted identification of hybrid sporophores (Xiong et al., 2014) (Figure 11.3).

11.5  THE SEPARATION OF SINGLE SPORE ISOLATES
The tested strains were cultivated on the cultivation medium (95% straw and waste cotton, 5% calcium 
carbonate, 65% tap water) for collecting the mature fruiting bodies. The spore prints obtained from the 
mature fruiting bodies were suspended in distilled water and, after appropriate dilution, spread onto 
PDA (potato dextrose agar) plates. After incubation at 32°C, well-separated colonies were subcultured 
onto PDA slants following Royse’s method (Royse et al., 1987).
11.6  CLONING THE MATING TYPE GENE
The whole genome of strain V23 (A mating type locus alleles A1 + A2) and PY (A mating type locus 
alleles A3 + A4) have been sequenced and deposited at the NCBI database, so it is easy to obtain 
the DNA sequences of mating type genes of strain V23 and PY by using the BLAST (Basic Local 
Alignment Search Tool) program. However, if a new V. volvacea strain without the information of the 
whole genomic sequence was used as the tested parent strain, how do we clone the DNA sequences of 
the mating type genes of this new strain?
The mip and β-fg genes flanking A, the mating type locus, provide a convenient method 
to clone new mating type genes of the new strain. However, the DNA sequences of mip genes of  
V. volvacea have polymorphism and are different between tested homokaryotic strains. So we usually 
obtain the conserved fragment of the mip genes by using a pair of degenerate PCR primers (mip-F: 
5′-TGGGAYMGNGAYTTYTAYTGYCC; mip-R: 5′-CATNGCRTGNCCCATYTCRTGRAA), and 
then design the specific primers according to the conserved region of mip genes for different tested 
strains.
In our laboratory, we obtained a new strain VT1 (A mating type locus alleles A5 + A6) 
derived from Thailand and isolated the single spore isolates VT1-1 and VT1-2. We designed 
the upstream specific primer A5mip-F1 (5′-ATACAGAGTGAGGGAGTCATTTGG) for strain 
VT1-1 and A6mip-F1 (5′-GGTGGAGGTTAAATACCAAGTGAG) for strain VT1-2, accord-
ing to the conserved DNA sequence of mip gene. The downstream specific primer fg-R1 
(5′-TCGGAGGAAGCGGGTCCACTACA) is designed for both strains based on the conserved DNA 
sequence of β-fg gene (Figure 11.2).
The approximately 5-kb DNA sequence containing the A5 mating type locus was obtained 
from V. volvacea strain VT-1 by long-chain PCR using a pair of primers, A5mip-F1 and fg-R1. 
Further analysis showed that the A5 mating type locus of strain VT-1 contained vv-HD1-A5-VT1-1 and  
vv-HD2-A5-VT1-1 genes (GenBank accession numbers: KF702360 and KF702361), 162 bp apart in the 
opposite direction, which were 1341 and 1450 bp in length and encoded HD1-A5-VT1-1 (446 amino acids) 
and HD2-A5-VT1-1 (429 amino acids), respectively. The similarity of HD1-A5-VT1-1 and HD2-A5-VT1-1 with 
HD1-A1-V23-1 (GeneBank accession number: AEO99207.1) and HD2-A1-V23-1 (GenBank accession num-
ber: AEO99208.1) are 51% and 49%, and with HD1-A2-V23-18 and HD2-A2-V23-18 (GenBank accession 
number: JX157875) are 56% and 45%, respectively. The vv-HD1-A5-VT1-1 gene is 531 bp apart from the 
mip gene.
The A6 mating type locus of strain VT-2 was amplified using primers A6mip-F1 and fg-R1, and 
contained vv-HD1-A6-VT1-2 and vv-HD2-A6-VT1-2 genes (GeneBank accession numbers: KJ396286 and 
KJ396287), 161 bp apart in the opposite direction, which were 1442 and 1501 bp in length and encoded 

197
11.8  The Marker-Assisted Identification of Homokaryons
HD1-A6-VT1-1 (463 amino acids) and HD2-A6-VT1-2 (443 amino acids), respectively. The similarity of 
HD1-A6-VT1-2 and HD2-A6-VT1-2 with HD1-A1-V23-1 and HD2-A1-V23-1 are 41% and 46%, and with HD1-
A2-V23-18 and HD2-A2-V23-18 are 45% and 48%, respectively. The vv-HD1-A6-T1 is 818 bp apart from the 
mip gene.
The above information on the A mating type loci of V. volvacea strain VT-1 will be helpful in 
designing the specific PCR primers for amplifying the mating type genes.
11.7  DESIGNING THE PCR PRIMERS FOR AMPLIFYING THE  
MATING TYPE GENES
The heterokaryon V. volvacea has two different mating type loci, each of which contains two mating 
type genes, HD1 and HD2, usually having ~1700 bp length, respectively, and being <500 bp apart.  
A pair of specific PCR primers must be designed for each mating type locus to check the specificity of 
the mating type gene. Usually, the upstream primer was designed to locate at the HD1 gene, and the 
downstream one was within the HD2 gene. So the interval of HD1 and HD2 genes was spanned by the 
pair of PCR primers. The length of the amplified PCR fragment has usually <1000 bp, which is easy 
and quick to detect by electrophoresis. In our previous study, the primer pairs A1-F/A1-R and A2-F/
A2-R (Figure 11.2, Table 11.2), which produced 655 and 265 bp amplified DNA fragments, respec-
tively, were designed based on the HD1 and HD2 gene sequences (HQ343318 and JX157875) of the 
A1 and A2 alleles in the A mating type locus of strain V23 (Xiong et al., 2014). The primer pairs A3-F/
A3-R and A4-F/A4-R, which produced 748 and 693 bp amplified DNA fragments, respectively, were 
designed according to the HD1 and HD2 gene sequences (JN578700 and JN578701) of the A3 and A4 
alleles in the A mating type locus of strain PY (Xiong et al., 2014).
11.8  THE MARKER-ASSISTED IDENTIFICATION OF HOMOKARYONS
The single spore isolates of V. volvacea contained the self-fertile (heterokaryotic) strains and the 
self-sterile (homokaryotic) strains (Chiu and Moore, 1999). Only the homokaryon is a useful

Chapter 11  V. VOLVACEA: IDENTIFICATION AND APPLICATION 
candidate for cross-breeding; the heterokaryon will disturb the results of the cross-breeding test. So the  
key step for the cross-breeding of V. volvacea is to select out the homokaryotic strains from the  
single spore isolates. Due to the absence of clamp connection formation in the heterokaryotic strain  
of V. volvacea (Chang, 1983), it is difficult to establish the difference between homokaryotic and heter-
okaryotic strains according to morphological trait as in the case of other mushrooms, such as L. edodes 
or P. ostreates.
Fortunately, the homokaryon of the single spore isolates has only one kind of the two mating type 
loci (Ax or Ay) of the parent strain, but the heterokaryon has both mating type loci (Ax and Ay) of the 
parent strain. Thus, it is possible to identify the homokaryon and heterokaryon by detecting the exist-
ence of the mating type loci according to the specificities of the mating type genes. For example, we 
obtained 124 single spore isolates at random isolated from V. volvacea strain V23 (A mating type 
locus alleles A1 + A2). Mating types A1 and A2 of the single spore isolate were identified by DNA 
fragments amplified using the primer pairs A1-F/A1-R and A2-F/A2-R, respectively. By using the 
molecular screening, a total of 101 single spore isolates were putatively identified as homokaryons, of 
which 35 were mating type A1 and 66 mating type A2. The remaining 23 were heterokaryons carrying  
both A1 and A2 mating type loci (Xiong et al., 2014). Of the 88 single spore isolates isolated at random 
from strain PY (A mating type locus alleles A3 + A4), by detecting the DNA fragments amplified using 
the primer pairs A3-F/A3-R and A4-F/A4-R, 72 were putatively identified as homokaryons, of which 
41 were mating type A3 and 31 mating type A4. The remaining 16 were heterokaryons carrying both 
A3 and A4 mating type loci (Xiong et al., 2014). Among 62 single spore isolates at random isolated 
from strain No. 9715 (A mating type locus alleles A7 + A8), there were 21 homokaryons carrying A7 
and 23 homokaryons carrying A8, and the remaining 20 were heterokaryons carrying both A7 and A8.
11.9  CROSS-BREEDING BETWEEN PAIRS OF HOMOKARYONS
In the last step, the heterokaryotic strains could be picked out and not used as parent strains for the 
cross-breeding test. This will avoid disturbance of the heterokaryotic strains for pairing the cross strains.  
On the other hand, the homokaryotic strains will be accurately selected out with the information on the 
carried mating type genes, which will be helpful in designing compatible cross-pairings to be tested. 
In this step, the mycelia of two self-sterile isolates (homokaryons) with compatible mating types were 
inoculated 1.0 cm apart on to PDA plates and incubated at 32°C until they merged. Mycelium from the 
area of contact was subcultured onto fresh PDA medium and purified by repeated subculture from the 
edge of the fungal colony. In our study, we paired the 72 homokaryons (41 strains carrying A3 mating 
type locus and 31 strains with A4) derived from strain PY with the homokaryotic strain V23-1 carrying 
the A1 mating type locus (Xiong et al., 2014).
11.10  MARKER-ASSISTED IDENTIFICATION OF HYBRIDS
The putative hybrids had been purified by the repeated subculture in last step, but this operation still 
couldn’t ensure all assumed hybrids are true ones. So we further used the molecular markers of the 
mating type genes to identify the realness of the putative hybrids. If the putative hybrid has only one 
of the mating type loci of the parent strains, this means the cross is incompatible and we will delete it.  

199
11.12  Marker-Assisted Identification of Hybrid Sporophores
If the putative hybrid has both mating type loci of the parent strains, we will treat it as assumed com-
patible crosses (the mixed culture of the homokaryotic parent strains cannot be found in this way, but 
the rate of this happening is usually very low) and use them for the cultivation test. In our laboratory, 
we identified the above-mentioned 72 crosses between the homokaryons derived from strain PY and 
the homokaryotic strain V23-1; the results revealed that the putative compatible crosses were 58 pairs,  
33 of which derived from the crosses between 41 A3 strains and the A1 strain V23-1 (compatible mat-
ing rate: 80.5%), and 25 of which came from the crosses between 31 A4 strains and the A1 strain V23-1 
(compatible mating rate: 80.6%) (Xiong et al., 2014). In our study, we deleted about 20% of candidate 
hybrids based on molecular marker-assisted identification in this step, which eliminated a lot of labor in 
the further experiment. In other laboratory work, 106 crosses between the single spore isolates of strain 
PY and strain No. 9715 were all identified as heterokaryons and shown to be compatible.
11.11  CULTIVATION EXPERIMENTS
All putative hybrids were to be cultivated for checking the ability of fruiting body production and 
selecting for biological traits such as: fruiting body yields, average weight of fruit bodies, time between 
substrate inoculation and primordia formation, fruiting body color, and tendency of fruit bodies to open 
(parachuting). In our laboratory, the cultivation test was carried out by the following process. The cul-
tivation medium usually consisted of 95% straw and waste cotton, 5% calcium carbonate, and 65% tap 
water. The compost was turned each time the temperature at a depth of 10 cm reached 55°C, and the pH 
was regulated to 8.0–8.5 with lime. After uniformly mixing, the compost was spread over the cultiva-
tion beds to a thickness of approximately 12 cm and compost temperature was maintained at 65°C for 
12 h by steam heating. The surface temperature was then allowed to fall to 30–32°C by natural cooling 
before inoculating with spawn, after which the temperature of the cultivating room was maintained 
at 30–32°C by air-conditioning. Tap water was sprayed on the compost at 500 g per square meter five 
days after inoculation, primordia appeared 2–3 days later, and harvesting commenced after a further  
3–5 days. Each putative hybrid strain was cultivated in triplicate, and the cultivation data were sub-
jected to statistical analysis using SAS software.
In our study, the cultivation tests revealed that all 58 putative hybrids produced fruiting bodies, 
which means that all crossed pairs were indeed compatible and produced true heterokaryotic cross-bred 
strains. The cultivation experiments undertaken to determine selected biological traits associated with 
the cross-bred strains revealed that highest yields (1735 g per 10 kg wet substrate) were obtained with 
hybrid PV26, while the lowest-yielding hybrid, PV5, produced only 135 g per 10 kg wet substrate. In 
the initial cultivation experiments, among 58 putative hybrids, only 18 strains producing high-quality 
fruiting bodies and exhibiting a range of desirable biological traits were selected for a second screen-
ing test using the parent strains (V23 and PY) as controls, three of which were designated as candidate 
hybrids for further selected cultivation experiments.
11.12  MARKER-ASSISTED IDENTIFICATION OF HYBRID SPOROPHORES
This step is usually carried out to confirm that the fruiting body derived from the hybrid is a true hete-
orkaryon, using the molecular markers of the mating type genes. DNA was extracted from the mature 

200
Chapter 11  V. VOLVACEA: IDENTIFICATION AND APPLICATION 
fruiting body using an improved CTAB method (Zhang et al., 2006). Mating types A1 and A2 were 
identified by the DNA fragments amplified using primer pairs A1-F/A1-R and A2-F/A2-R, respectively 
(Table 11.2). Mating types A3 and A4 were identified by the DNA fragments amplified using primer 
pairs A3-F/A3-R and A4-F/A4-R, respectively (Table 11.2). PCR reaction mixtures contained ddH2O 
(18.25 μL); 2.5 μL 10 × buffer solution; 2.0 μL dNTP (each 2.5 mmol/L); primer, 1 μL (10 μmol/L); 
0.25 μL Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/μL), 1 μL DNA template. Amplification conditions were: 94°C for 
5 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 51–53°C (see Table 11.1) for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min; followed by a 
final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% sepharose 
(Xiong et al., 2014). The above-mentioned 18 selected strains were confirmed as true hybrids by validation  
of the mating type using DNA extracted from the fruiting bodies (Figure 11.4).
To date, the sexual pattern of V. volvacea still remains unclear, but the V. volvacea genome has facil-
itated the establishment of an efficient and facile technique for V. volvacea cross-breeding using mating 
type genes as molecular markers. The above-described methodology employing a series of sequen-
tial steps reduces the workload and uncertainty inherent in cross-breeding for generating improved  
V. volvacea cultivars, and further application of the technique will provide an important stimulus to the 
V. volvacea cultivation industry.

12.1  INTRODUCTION
Agriculture is one of the main activities that provides food for the world population. One of the great-
est challenges faced by agriculturalists is their ability to control pathogens, insect pests and weeds that 
destroy crops in which time and financial resources have been invested.
Prior to modern agriculture, appropriate land use, crop rotation, and recycling of organic matter 
were effective in preventing pest proliferation. Generally, these methods avoided alteration of the eco-
systems that were exploited for agriculture (Altieri, 1995). However, as time progressed, the introduc-
tion and use of agrochemical compounds increased, permitting the total or partial elimination of insect 
pests and weeds in crop areas. Despite the obvious efficacy and benefits of these types of compounds, a 
series of restrictions and negative effects became evident, namely damage to human health, the elimina-
tion of beneficial insects, and the general modification of ecosystems. The World Health Organization 
has calculated that approximately 220,000 people die as a consequence of exposure to different insec-
ticides each year (Eddleston et al., 2002). Pesticides present a serious predicament in that the use of 
agrochemical compounds protects production, investment, and public health through the eradication of 
hunger, but at the same time they are extremely harmful to living organisms. Many of these compounds, 
including glyphosate, chlorothalonil, and paraquat, have successfully eradicated various natural agri-
cultural pests (Matlock and de la Cruz, 2002; Boza, 1972); however, their bioaccumulation and persis-
tence in the environment represent serious problems.
The onset of World War II saw the development of several organic insecticides such as dichlorodi-
phenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which experienced a boom between 1942 and 1950. Subsequently, it 
was removed from the majority of countries due to its easy accumulation in organism tissues and high 
persistence in the soil (Longnecker et al., 1997), although it is still employed in vector control strategies 
against mosquitoes that transmit dengue and malaria (WHO, 2006, 2009).

204
Chapter 12  FUNGI FOR DEGRADATION OF AGRO-PESTICIDES
The problem of persistence associated with insecticides is not limited to developing countries: in 
California, more than 6 million hectares of crop land were treated with pesticides between 1990 and 
2003 (Epstein and Bassein, 2003). One of the solutions to this problem is the use of integrated pest 
management (IPM) (Kogan, 1998). IPM refers to a decision-making system on the use of multiple pest 
control strategies, resulting in a management strategy based on cost analysis, the impact on society and 
the environment, and, most importantly, a reduction in the use of chemical products (Metcalf, 1980; 
Allen and Rajotte, 1990; Grewell et al., 2003).
There is a long history of organochloride pesticide (OCP) use in Mexico. Between 1974 and 1991, 
close to 60,000 tons of OCP, in particular DDT, were released into the environment; however, the use of 
this compound and chlordane was prohibited in 2000 and 2003, respectively (López-Carrillo et al., 1996; 
Moody, 2003). Despite these measures, concentrations of these compounds in the soil, air, and blood of 
people who had been in contact with them were much higher than permitted levels (Wong et al., 2008; 
Alegría et al., 2006).
One of the most important aspects of pesticides is their high prevalence index in the soil and the risk 
of these compounds reaching underground water tables. The persistence of these compounds in the soil 
is a result of many factors, including physical, chemical, and biological processes such as absorption, 
volatilization, chemical degradation, and accumulation in plants. These processes control the transport 
and form in which the pesticide moves in the soil, air, or water (Linn et al., 1993; Moorman et al., 2001), 
and are associated with many soil characteristics including pH, salinity, porosity, and the quantity of 
organic matter (Boivin et al., 2004; Clausen and Fabricius, 2002).
Residues of pesticide compounds have been found in the air, water, and soil; furthermore, they have 
been identified in several geographic regions, including some that are far from the original application 
site, such as deserts, oceans, and even in the polar regions. Many organisms such as whales and other 
arctic animals have accumulated pesticides in their tissues, and these compounds are magnified as they 
pass from one trophic level to another within food chains (biomagnification). Humans are not exempt 
from exposure to these contaminants, and pesticide residues have been found in a variety of tissues and 
secretions (Asita and Hatane, 2012; Miranda-Contreras et al., 2013; Ansari et al., 2014).
The residues that persist in soil or water can be degraded by microorganisms that are naturally 
present in the contaminated environment (Guo et al., 2000). However, in many cases this tends to be a 
slow process due to the high concentrations of the compounds or the incapacity of the microorganisms 
to incorporate them into their metabolic pathways (Rao et al., 1983).
12.2  BIOREMEDIATION OF XENOBIOTICS
Due to the aforementioned factors, the use of technologies such as bioremediation have increased 
over the last few years, and the search for appropriate strategies that permit the reduction of recalci-
trant compounds in the environment in a safe and natural way has been one of the main objectives of 
research centers.
Bioremediation exploits the capacity of microorganisms to degrade organic compounds, using those 
that are native to the contaminated sites or others that are genetically improved (Poindexter and Miller, 
1994; Nocentini et al., 2000; McGuinness and Dowling, 2009). There are several bioremediation pro-
cesses that are capable of biodegrading persistent compounds, the following being the most important: 
phytoremediation, algae treatment, and bacterial accumulation of xenobiotics.

205
12.2  Bioremediation of Xenobiotics
12.2.1  PHYTOREMEDIATION
Phytoremediation consists of using of plants to accumulate, remove, and neutralize organic compounds, 
metals, or radioactive compounds. This method takes advantage of the associations between plants and 
endophytic bacteria such as Acetobacter and Bacillus (McGuinness and Dowling, 2009). Similarly, 
numerous studies have focused on the improved resistance of genetically modified plants when faced 
with an accumulation of toxic compounds (Gisbert et al., 2003; Krämer and Chardonnens, 2001).
Another system that has proved to be very efficient in removing contaminants is algae treatments. 
These treatments are based on the capacity of algae to accumulate large quantities of metals and sev-
eral other compounds that are water contaminants (De Godos et al., 2009). An example is the use of 
the alga Fucus vesiculosus, which tolerates high concentrations of crude oil and its derivatives, which 
accumulate within its tissues (Wrabel and Peckol, 2000).
Another promising option for removing contaminants is the use of microorganisms such as bacteria, 
which possess metabolic pathways that enable the accumulation or metabolization of different types of 
xenobiotics. Research on these techniques has increased in recent years, particularly as it appears that 
they have less impact on the natural environment and can be applied simply and safely. Pseudomonas 
putida has been one of the most frequently used microorganisms for this type of bioremediation, and 
to date many research papers have been published, not only on the level of biodegradation of various 
compounds but on the specific mechanisms that carry out this process along the biodegradation meta-
bolic pathways (Reardon et al., 2000; Van Beilen et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2005; El-Naas et al., 2009).
12.2.2  BIOREMEDIATION BY FUNGI
One of the main groups of organisms used for bioremediation is white rot fungi. These living systems 
use a complex enzymatic system to degrade lignin, a highly complex polymer that is present in wood 
and is one of the main components in nature (Pointing, 2001). The enzymes that carry out this type of 
biodegradation are composed of extracellular oxidases and peroxidases, including laccases, manganese 
peroxidases, aryl alcohol oxidases, and lignin peroxidase, among others (Paszczynski and Crawford, 
2000; Noyotný et al., 2004).
Many fungal species have been extensively studied in relation to biodegradation. Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium, a resupinate or crust fungus belonging to the white rot fungi group, has been used 
as a model for the biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons, colorants, and pesticides (Kullman and 
Matsumura, 1996; Fournier et al., 2004; Lopera et al., 2005).
Laccase is one of the most studied enzymes for biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds; how-
ever, its capacity for degrading only phenolic compounds, which are rarely found in lignin, places 
it at a disadvantage compared with other enzymes such as lignin peroxidase, which are capable of 
degrading both phenolic and nonphenolic compounds (Higuchi, 2004). The use of mediators, sub-
stances of low molecular weight that act as electron acceptors during the oxide reduction reaction, 
favor the oxidation of those nonphenolic substrates that have a high redox potential. There are many 
compounds used as mediators; these promote the biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds in the envi-
ronment and are also used in the paper-making industry and for processing fruit juices. These include 
2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), violuric acid, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, 
N-hydroxyphthalimide, syringaldehyde, and 1-nitro-2-naphthol-3,6-disulfonic acid, among others 
(Moldes and Sanroman, 2006; Camarero et al., 2007; Baiocco et al., 2003).

206
Chapter 12  FUNGI FOR DEGRADATION OF AGRO-PESTICIDES
The use of brown rot fungi as mediators for contaminant biodegradation has also been suggested. 
These types of mushrooms are capable of degrading cellulose and hemicelluloses, but not the lignin 
present in wood. Bioremediation is carried out using free radicals produced by the Fenton reaction. 
This mechanism has been reported to play a specific role in the biodegradation of many xenobiotic 
compounds such as enrofloxacin, chlorophenol, and 2,4,6 trinitrotoluene (Wetzstein et  al., 1997; 
Schlosser et al., 2000; Newcombe et al., 2002). Other research includes the degradation of DDT by 
brown rot mushrooms such as Fomitopsis pinicola and Daedalea dickinsii, which can transform DDT 
to DDE 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene and DDD (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophe-
nyl) ethane) via the Fenton reaction (Purnomo et al., 2010, 2011).
Due to their importance, use, and distribution, pesticides have been the center of many biodeg-
radation studies. In this respect, the biodegradation of pentachlorophenol has been tested using 
P. chrysosporium, Berjkandera adusta, and Pleurotus ostreatus. The biodegradation percentages 
vary, with P. chrysosporium recording the highest with 96% after 64 days in a liquid culture medium 
(Lamar et al., 1990; Ruttimann and Lamar, 1997). Biodegradation of the insecticide lindane by the 
fungal species Trametes hirsuta, Pleurotus eryngii, and P. chrysosporium has been extensively studied. 
Liquid cultures as well as soil contaminated by these agrochemicals have been studied, resulting in bio-
degradation percentages ranging from 10.6% to 96%, demonstrating that T. hirsuta is the most suitable 
biodegrader (Arisoy, 1998; Quintero et al., 2007; Singh and Kuhad, 1999).
Another compound used as a study model is heptachlor; the use of this pesticide is currently 
prohibited, but residues that are highly toxic to living systems are still found in areas where it 
was previously applied. The species P. chrysosporium and two species from the Pleurotus genus, 
Pleurotus sajor-caju and P. eryngii, have been used in studies of heptachlor biodegradation 
(Arisoy, 1998; Kennedy et al., 1990).
Finally, a number of studies have been done on the biodegradation of glyphosate, one of the most 
widely used herbicides worldwide. In this case, the process was carried out using purified enzymes. 
Total degradation of this compound was achieved when laccase and manganese peroxide were incu-
bated, using ABTS as a mediator for the former and manganese sulfate and Tween 80 for the latter 
(Pizzul et al., 2009).
Important advances have been made regarding the biodegradation of three model compounds: 
endosulfan (insecticide), chlorothalonil (fungicide), and paraquat (herbicide). These three compounds 
present aromatic structures that can be used as a target for nonspecific extracellular enzymes of the 
ligninolytic type that possess several macromycetes (Figure 12.1).
12.2.2.1  Endosulfan biodegradation by fungi
Endosulfan is an insecticide that is applied extensively to coffee, tea, and cotton crops, among others. 
In its commercial form, endosulfan is composed of two stereoisomers, α and β endosulfan, in a 70:30 
ratio. This compound is especially toxic for aquatic organisms (Broomhall, 2002; Capkin et al., 2006). 
In mammals, it can induce reproductive toxicity (Saiyed et al., 2003; Bharath et al., 2011) and neuro-
toxicity (Ravi and Varma, 1998). In the soil, endosulfan is converted into endosulfan sulfate by oxi-
dation and diol endosulfan by hydrolysis. Both isomers present different levels of persistence in the 
environment. The half-life of total endosulfan and α and β endosulfan is 1336 and 27.5 and 157 days, 
respectively, under aerobic conditions (GFEA-U, 2007; US EPA, 2007a). Endosulfan sulfate is a more 
persistent and toxic residue than endosulfan isomers (US EPA, 2007b).

207
12.2  Bioremediation of Xenobiotics
Various studies have been conducted on the biodegradation of the insecticide endosulfan. The capacity 
of Aspergillus niger to metabolize this compound was tested, revealing that this species is capable of elim-
inating a concentration of 400 ppm endosulfan after 12 days of incubation (Tejomyee and Pravin, 2007). 
Another study demonstrated the biodegradation of endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate by the fungi 
T. hirsuta, achieving 90% removal after 14 days incubation (Kamei et al., 2011).
The ability of fungal strains from the Pleurotus genus and the species Auricularia fuscosuccinea to 
degrade endosulfan was demonstrated. Eighty Pleurotus strains including Pleurotus djamor, Pleurotus 
ostreatus, Pleurotus cornucopiae, and Pleurotus cystidiosus were studied. The results show that all 
the evaluated strains were capable of growth in a concentration of 100 ppm endosulfan. The growth 
medium was deprived of glucose, indicating that these fungi were able to degrade the contaminant 
and use it as a source of carbon. One of the Pleurotus pulmonarius strains grown in a liquid culture 
achieved 96.98% and 93.62% biodegradation of α endosulfan and β endosulfan, respectively, after 
8 days of growth. Figure 12.1 shows the influence of culture medium composition on biodegradation 
rates (Kegley et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2001; Wales et al., 2003; Shia et al., 2013). A medium with 
high nitrogen concentration (HNC) and another with low nitrogen concentration (LNC) were used; the 
LNC degraded compounds at a faster rate than the HNC (Mendoza et al., 2008) (Figure 12.2).
During fungal development, the growth substrate may contain considerable quantities of endosul-
fan; thus, it is important to know how the pasteurization and composting processes affect compound 
degradation and also compare these processes using biodegradation by the fungi P. pulmonarius. 
During the composting process of the grass Digitaria decumbens, in the presence of Ca(OH)2, a 
reduction in α and β endosulfan concentration by 61.4% and 49.5%, respectively, was achieved; this 
was considerably more than was attained by the control (38.5%), which did not contain Ca(OH)2.

Chapter 12  FUNGI FOR DEGRADATION OF AGRO-PESTICIDES
This indicates that the process of substrate alkalinization is fundamental to the degradation process. 
In the case of sterilization, 84.8% of α endosulfan and 87.5% of β endosulfan was removed. Finally, 
subsequent to substrate colonization by P. pulmonarius, α and β endosulfan were degraded by 99%. 
These results demonstrated that although considerable removal of endosulfan is achieved during the 
composting and sterilization processes, much higher levels of degradation (99%) are achieved as a 
result of fungal growth (Hernández-Rodríguez et al., 2006).
In the case of A. fuscosuccinea, 100 ppm of endosulfan was removed over a period of 8 days 
using a medium with a limited source of carbon; however, biomass production was much lower 
when compared to the control, demonstrating that endosulfan is capable of inhibiting fungal growth 
(Escobar et al., 2002). Studies on endosulfan biodegradation by A. fuscosuccinea strains have contin-
ued; in one study, biodegradation was carried out using four species of A. fuscosuccinea. Their biodeg-
radation capacity was evaluated after 4 and 8 days of growth; it was determined that biodegradation 
reached approximately 100% after 8 days of growth for all the evaluated strains; furthermore, the cell-
free culture mix was capable of degrading the insecticide, indicating that an extracellular enzyme may 
be responsible for biodegradation. An analysis of the enzymes that participated in the biodegradation 
process revealed only laccase and phenol oxidase activities; thus, it can be inferred that these could be 
involved in endosulfan biodegradation (Yanez-Montalvo et al., 2015).
12.2.2.2  Chlorothalonil biodegradation by fungi
Around 45 species of microorganisms have been described that are capable of degrading the fungicide 
chlorothalonil; bacteria and actinomycetes comprise the large majority of the microorganisms studied, 
the most important being Bacillus cereus, Moraxella spp., and Agrobacterium spp., which are capable 
of degrading a concentration of 50 ppm chlorothalonil (Wang et al., 2011).
The bacterial species Ochrobactrum lupine can degrade 90.4% and 99.7% chlorothalonil after 
4 and 7 days of incubation, respectively, using a mineral salt medium and a 50 ppm contaminant con-
centration (Shi et al., 2011). The assays conducted with this fungicide refer to biodegradation using

12.2  Bioremediation of Xenobiotics
spent mushroom substrate (SMS) from the strain P. pulmonarius ECS-0190. These experiments dem-
onstrated that after two mushroom harvests, the remaining substrate could be used for degradation of 
an aqueous solution containing the fungicide (2 mg/L chlorothalonil). Freshly obtained SMS extract 
was able to reduce 100% of the initial concentration of chlorothalonil (2 mg/L) in a liquid effluent after 
45 min of contact. SMS storage time had a negative effect on the stability of enzymatic activity: using 
spent substrate stored for a week, chlorothalonil concentration was reduced by 49.5% after 1 h reaction, 
while with substrate stored for 2 and 3 weeks, biodegradation efficiency decreased to 9.15% and 0%, 
respectively. Cooling and freezing the spent substrate extract also had a negative effect on chlorotha-
lonil biodegradation (Córdova-Juárez et al., 2011). However, in these studies, the authors could not 
determine if biodegradation was caused by ligninolytic enzymes (essentially phenol oxidase, laccase, 
and MN-peroxidase) from the cultivated fungi. This suggests the influence of other factors such as the 
presence of mediators or alternative systems that enable degradation.
12.2.2.3  Biodegradation of paraquat
Paraquat is a nonsystemic contact herbicide that is applied to coffee, banana, mango, and sugar crops. 
Its use has been prohibited in many countries; however, it is still distributed in some countries, including 
Mexico (Wesseling et al., 2001). This highly toxic herbicide is still extensively used, mainly due to its 
low price, rapid action, and environmental characteristics. A large number of cases of poisoning and death 
from ingestion by humans have been reported. The compound is not absorbed into the intestinal tract 
and therefore tends to accumulate in the kidneys and lungs (Shimada et al., 2002; Murray and Gibson, 
1974). Paraquat also causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (Liou et al., 1996; Chanyachukul 
et al., 2004). Due to its high persistence in the soil, it is difficult to eliminate and therefore presents severe 
problems of contamination and accumulation (Smith and Mayfield, 1978). In the soil, paraquat can be 
removed by implementing two techniques. The first is the photolytic technique, using low wavelengths 
(300–200 nm). In this method the main metabolites produced from paraquat are monoquat and piridone; 
however, this only occurs in the soil surface layers and is very inefficient as most of the paraquat remains 
in the soil layers below the surface. The second method is the microbial technique, producing mainly 
monoquat, which can subsequently be metabolized into ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water. This type of 
biodegradation depends largely on soil type and the quantity of paraquat (Roberts et al., 2002).
There are few reports on paraquat degradation using microorganisms. The bacterial species 
Pseudomonas putida has been used as a model for research on the biodegradation of diverse envi-
ronmental contaminants. One such study on paraquat biodegradation resulted in 90% removal of the 
contaminant in 24 h, using activated carbon (Kopytko et al., 2002). Other studies have analyzed pho-
tolytic degradation of this herbicide; for example, the effectiveness of X-ray diffraction, UV diffuse 
reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy have been demonstrated. These methods 
have attained 100% contaminant reduction using a support of copper and titanium mesoporous material 
(Sorolla et al., 2012).
A large number of fungal species have not yet been studied, and as many of these grow in areas that 
have suffered from indiscriminate use of harmful substances, they can tolerate or even biodegrade large 
quantities of contaminants. To increase knowledge on this type of fungi, native strains from the southeast 
region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico, were isolated and characterized. These strains were collected 
from coffee farms and crop fields that had been susceptible to paraquat application. Some 105 strains 
were analyzed to determine the biodegradation capacity in a liquid medium with 200 ppm of paraquat. 
The experiment was carried out over a period of 15 days, after which the residual paraquat was extracted 

210
Chapter 12  FUNGI FOR DEGRADATION OF AGRO-PESTICIDES
and the levels of biodegradation were quantified. Approximately 10 strains were capable of biodegrading 
between 30% and 90% of paraquat present in the growth medium.
12.3  PERSPECTIVES
Without doubt, the indiscriminate use of chemical products in agriculture has generated a huge amount of 
contamination in the air, water, and soil. Currently, the use of alternative technologies against pest species, 
such as bioinsecticides, integral pest management, and genetically modified plants that can exploit soil 
nutrients more efficiently, or with specific insect defense characteristics; together, these provide an encour-
aging picture. However, more work is needed on bioremediation treatments that include the use of ligni-
nolytic enzymes, intracellular metabolic pathways, and biodegradation by native soil microorganisms, the 
latter considered as one of the best techniques in counteracting high pollution levels that persist in the soil.
Currently, studies and processes are being developed to improve the use of the enzymatic sys-
tems that only microorganisms possess. An alternative that offers great potential for the develop-
ment of innovative applications refers to the use of self-propelled nanomotors (Soler and Sánchez, 
2014). These systems are already being tested with ligninases. Orozco et al. (2014) report using a 
self-propelled tubular motor that releases an enzyme for efficient biocatalytic degradation of chemical 
pollutants. These processes are based on the Marangoni effect, involving the simultaneous release of 
an SDS surfactant and the enzyme remediation agent laccase in the polluted sample. The movement 
induces fluid convection and leads to the rapid dispersion of laccase into the contaminated solution and 
to a dramatically accelerated biocatalytic decontamination process.
These new alternatives, together with those that already exist, are potential tools that can be used to 
reduce or alleviate levels of agrochemical contamination in the environment. Essentially, they are still 
under development, and it will probably take more than 10 years until crops can be grown on soils that 
are free from agrochemical residues, or before the new treatments can be used to treat effluent waters 
from agroindustry and agriculture.
Despite having been little studied, the enzymatic systems of macromycetes appear to be very pow-
erful, and therefore further research is needed, particularly when applications for the biodegradation 
of other contaminants are found, such as newly emerging contaminants for which there is currently no 
treatment method (De Morais et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2012).
