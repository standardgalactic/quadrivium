Preface
The principal aims of this monograph are (i) to serve as an introduction and a
guide to the basic principles and the analysis of collocation methods for a broad
range of functional equations, including initial-value problems for ordinary
and delay differential equations, and Volterra integral and integro-differential
equations; (ii) to describe the current ‘state of the art’ of the ﬁeld; (iii) to
make the reader aware of the many (often very challenging) problems that
remain open and which represent a rich source for future research; and (iv) to
show, by means of the annotated list of references and the Notes at the end of
each chapter, that Volterra equations are not simply an ‘isolated’ small class of
functional equations but that they play an (increasingly) important – and often
unexpected! – role in time-dependent PDEs, boundary integral equations, and
in many other areas of analysis and applications.
The book can be divided in a natural way into four parts:
r In Part I we focus on collocation methods, mostly in piecewise polyno-
mial spaces, for ﬁrst-kind and second-kind Volterra integral equations (VIEs,
Chapter 2), and Volterra integro-differential equations (Chapter 3) possess-
ing smooth solutions: here, the regularity of the solution on the interval of
integration essentially coincides with that of the given data. This situation is
similar to the one encountered in initial-value problems for ordinary differ-
ential equations. Hence, Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to collocation
methods applied to initial-value problems for ODEs: this will allow us to
acquire an appreciation of the richness of these methods and their analysis
for more general functional equations encountered in subsequent chapters
of this book.
r Part II deals with Volterra integral and integro-differential equations contain-
ing delay arguments. For non-vanishing delays (Chapter 4), smooth data will
in general no longer lead to solutions with comparable regularity on the entire
ix

Preface
interval of integration, and hence optimal orders of convergence in colloca-
tion approximations comparable to those seen in the previous chapters can
only be attained by a careful choice of the underlying meshes. For equations
with (vanishing) proportional delays (Chapter 5) the situation is completely
different. Here, the solution inherits the regularity of the given data, but on
uniform meshes the analysis of the attainable order of superconvergence is
much more complex, due to the ‘overlap’ between the collocation points
and their images under the given delay function. This is not yet completely
understood, and a number of problems remain open.
r In Part III we study collocation methods for Volterra integral equations
(Chapter 6) and integro-differential equations (Chapter 7) with weakly sin-
gular kernels. The presence of these kernel singularities gives rise to a sin-
gular behaviour (different in nature from the non-smooth behaviour encoun-
tered in Chapter 4) of the solutions at the initial point of the interval of in-
tegration, and at the primary discontinuity points if there is a non-vanishing
delay: typically, the ﬁrst- or second-order derivatives of the solutions, or
(in the case of ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equations) the solution itself, are
unbounded at these points. Thus, a decrease in the order of convergence
can only be avoided either by introducing suitably graded meshes, or by
switching to appropriate non-polynomial spline spaces, reﬂecting the nature
of this singular behaviour. This insight is then combined with results gained
in Chapter 4 when turning, at the end of Chapters 6 and 7, to collocation
methods for Volterra equations possessing weakly singular kernels and delay
arguments.
r In Part IV (Chapters 8 and 9) we shall have reached the current ‘frontier’ in
the analysis of collocation methods when considering their use for solving
integral-algebraic equations (IAEs, which may be viewed as differential-
algebraic equations (DAEs) with memory terms, or as ‘abstract’ DAEs in an
inﬁnite-dimensional setting) and singularly perturbed Volterra integral and
integro-differential equations. It is known from the numerical analysis of
DAEs that the ‘direct’ application of collocation (even for index-1 problems)
will in general not yield the ‘expected’ convergence (and stability) behaviour
since very often the given problem is not ‘numerically well formulated’. But
while this is now well understood for DAEs, we have a far way to go when
analysing collocation methods for suitably reformulated IAEs. Thus, much
of Chapter 8 consists of a look into the future. Chapter 9 adds some additional
dimensions to this outlook: it points to a number of – to me – promising and
important directions of research that may contain the keys to obtaining deeper
insight into a number of the open problems we met in previous chapters.

Preface
xi
It will become apparent that the number of unanswered questions and open
problems becomes larger as we move through the chapters. For example, the
analysis of asymptotic stability of collocation solutions for most classes of
Volterra integral and functional differential equations is still in its infancy (I
believe that relatively little essential progress has been made since Pieter van
der Houwen and I wrote down a similar observation in the preface of our 1986
book), and this lack of progress and new results is reﬂected in the fact that
the present monograph deals with this topic only peripherally. It has also be-
come clear from recent advances in the analysis of the asymptotic properties
of numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations (Hairer and Wanner
(1996)), dynamical systems (Stuart and Humphries (1996)), and delay dif-
ferential equations (Bellen and Zennaro (2003)), that the study of the anal-
ogous properties of collocation methods for more general functional differ-
ential and integral equations will eventually have to be treated in a separate
monograph.
Most chapters begin with a section reviewing the relevant elementary theory
of the class of equations to be discretised by collocation. It goes without saying
that a thorough understanding of the theoretical aspects of a given functional
equation is imperative since a successful analysis of its discretisation will often
be inspired, and thus helped along, by insight into the essential features in the
analysis of the given equation and the corresponding discrete analogue derived
by collocation.
At the end of each chapter the reader will ﬁnd exercises and extensive notes.
The Exercises range from ‘hands-on’ problems (intended to illustrate and com-
plement the theory of the respective chapter) to research topics of various degree
of difﬁculty, and these will often include important unsolved problems. The pur-
pose of the Notes is twofold: they contain remarks complementing the contents
of the given chapter (giving, e.g., the sources of original results), and they point
out papers on related topics not treated in the book.
The list of References tries to be representative, without being exhaustive,
of the developments in the research on collocation methods over the last 80
years or so. Moreover, it includes many papers on the analysis and application
of collocation methods to types of functional equations not treated in this book.
The intent of these references is to guide the reader to work that describes
results and mathematical techniques whose analogues and application are, in my
view, of potential interest for Volterra integral and related functional differential
equations, and they may thus yield the motivation for future research work. In
order to make this extensive bibliography more useful and give it a certain
guiding role, many of its items have been annotated, so as to enhance the Notes
given at the end of each chapter: the brief comments are either cross-references
to related work, give an idea of the main content of a paper, or point to books and

xii
Preface
survey articles containing large bibliographies complementing the one given in
this monograph.
As mentioned above, the bibliography lists also many papers and books
dealing with topics where exciting work is currently being carried but which,
due to limitations of space (and lack of expertise on my part) are not included in
this book. Among these topics are spectral and pseudo-spectral methods (which
appear to be very promising for Volterra equations but whose theory remains to
be developed); sequential (collocation based) regularisation methods for ﬁrst-
kind VIEs; the numerical treatment of Volterra equations occurring in control
theory; and a posteriori error estimation and the design of adaptive collocation
methods (especially for problems with non-smooth solutions). I hope that these
additional references, while not directly relevant to the text of the monograph,
and the accompanying notes will encourage the reader to have a closer look at
these important topics.
This monograph is intended for researchers in numerical and applied analy-
sis, for ‘users’ of collocation methods in the physical sciences and in engineer-
ing, and as an introduction to collocation methods for senior undergraduate and
graduate students.
Since the exercise section of each chapter contains a rich list of open prob-
lems, the book may also serve as a source of topics for M.Sc. and Ph.D. theses.
Prerequisites: Senior-level courses in linear algebra, the theory of ordinary
differential equations, and numerical analysis (especially numerical quadrature
and the numerical solution of ODEs). A knowledge of elementary functional
analysis will prove helpful in Chapter 8.

The collocation method for ODEs:
an introduction
A collocation solution uh to a functional equation (for example an ordinary
differential equation or a Volterra integral equation) on an interval I is an
element from some ﬁnite-dimensional function space (the collocation space)
which satisﬁes the equation on an appropriate ﬁnite subset of points in I (the
set of collocation points) whose cardinality essentially matches the dimension
of the collocation space. If initial (or boundary) conditions are present then uh
will usually be required to fulﬁl these conditions, too.
The use of polynomial or piecewise polynomial collocation spaces for the
approximate solution of boundary-value problems has its origin in the 1930s.
For initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations such collocation
methods were ﬁrst studied systematically in the late 1960s: it was then shown
that collocation in continuous piecewise polynomial spaces leads to an impor-
tant class of implicit (high-order) Runge–Kutta methods.
1.1 Piecewise polynomial collocation for ODEs
1.1.1 Collocation-based implicit Runge–Kutta methods
Consider the initial-value problem
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
y(0) = y0,
(1.1.1)
and assume that the (Lipschitz-) continuous function f : I ×  ⊂IR →IR is
such that (1.1.1) possesses a unique solution y ∈C1(I) for all y0 ∈. Let
Ih := {tn : 0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tN = T }
be a given (not necessarily uniform) mesh on I, and set σn := (tn, tn+1], ¯σn :=
[tn, tn+1],
with
hn := tn+1 −tn (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1).
The

1 The collocation method for ODEs: an introduction
h := max{hn : 0 ≤n ≤N −1} will be called the diameter of the mesh
Ih; in the context of time-stepping we will also refer to h as the stepsize. Note
that we have, in rigorous notation,
tn = t(N)
n
,
σn := σ (N)
n
,
hn = h(N)
n
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1), and h = h(N).
However, we will usually suppress this dependence on N, the number of subin-
tervals corresponding to a given mesh Ih, except occasionally in the conver-
gence analyses where N →∞, h = h(N) →0, so that Nh(N) remains uni-
formly bounded.
The solution y of the initial-value problem (1.1.1) will be approximated by
an element uh of the piecewise polynomial space
S(0)
m (Ih) := {v ∈C(I) : v| ¯σn ∈πm (0 ≤n ≤N −1)},
(1.1.2)
where πm denotes the space of all (real) polynomials of degree not exceeding
m. It is readily veriﬁed that S(0)
m (Ih) is a linear space whose dimension is
dim S(0)
m (Ih) = Nm + 1
(a description of more general piecewise polynomial spaces will be given in
Section 2.2.1). This approximation uh will be found by collocation; that is, by
requiring that uh satisfy the given differential equation on a given suitable ﬁnite
subset Xh of I, and coincide with the exact solution y at the initial point t = 0.
It is clear that the cardinality of Xh, the set of collocation points, will have to
be equal to Nm, and the obvious choice of Xh is to place m distinct collocation
points in each of the N subintervals ¯σn. To be more precise, let Xh be given by
Xh := {t = tn + cihn : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}.
(1.1.3)
For a given mesh Ih, the collocation parameters {ci} completely determine Xh.
Its cardinality is
|Xh|
=
 Nm
if 0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (or 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm < 1),
N(m −1) + 1
if 0 = c1 < c2 < . . . < cm = 1 (m ≥2).

(1.1.4)
If uh corresponds to a set of collocation points with c1 = 0 and cm = 1 (m ≥2),
it lies (if it exists on I) in the smoother space S(0)
m (Ih) ∩C1(I) =: S(1)
m (Ih) of
dimension N(m −1) + 2 whenever the given function f in (1.1.1) is contin-
uous. This follows readily by considering the collocation equation (1.1.4) at

1.1 Piecewise polynomial collocation for ODEs

t = tn−1 + cmhn−1 =: t−
n and at t = tn + c1hn =: t+
n : taking the difference and
using the continuity of f leads to
u′
h(t+
n ) −u′
h(t−
n ) = 0,
n = 1, . . . , N −1,
and this is equivalent to u′
h being continuous at t = tn.
In order to obtain more insight into this piecewise polynomial collocation
method, and to exhibit its recursive nature, we now derive the computational
form of (1.1.4). This will reveal that the collocation equation (1.1.4) represents
the stage equations of an m-stage continuous implicit Runge–Kutta method for
the initial-value problem (1.1.1) (compare also the original papers by Guillou
and Soul´e (1969), Wright (1970), or the book by Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner
(1993).
Here, and in subsequent chapters of the book, it will be convenient (and
natural) to work with the local Lagrange basis representations of uh. Since
u′
h|σn ∈πm−1, we have
u′
h(tn + vhn) =
m

j=1
L j(v)Yn, j, v ∈(0, 1],
Yn, j := u′
h(tn + c jhn), (1.1.5)
where the polynomials
L j(v) :=
m

k̸= j
v −ck
c j −ck
( j = 1, . . . , m),
denote the Lagrange fundamental polynomials with respect to the (distinct)
collocation parameters {ci}. Setting yn := uh(tn) and
β j(v) :=
 v
0
L j(s)ds
( j = 1, . . . , m),
we obtain from (1.1.5) the local representation of uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) on ¯σn, namely
uh(tn + vhn) = yn + hn
m

j=1
β j(v)Yn, j,
v ∈[0, 1].
(1.1.6)
The unknown (derivative) approximations Yn,i (i = 1, . . . , m) in (1.1.6) are
deﬁned by the solution of a system of (generally nonlinear) algebraic equations
obtained by setting t = tn,i := tn + cihn in the collocation equation (1.1.4) and
employing the local representations (1.1.5) and (1.1.6). This system is

1 The collocation method for ODEs: an introduction
We see that the equations (1.1.6) and (1.1.7) deﬁne, as asserted above, a
continuous implicit Runge–Kutta (CIRK) method for the initial-value prob-
lem (1.1.1): its m stage values Yn,i are given by the solution of the nonlinear
algebraic systems (1.1.7), and (1.1.6) deﬁnes the approximation uh for each
t ∈¯σn (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1). This local representation may be viewed as the
natural interpolant in πm on ¯σn for the data {(tn, yn), (tn,i, Yn,i) (i = 1, . . . , m)}.
It thus follows that such a continuous implicit RK method contains an em-
bedded ‘classical’ (discrete) m-stage implicit Runge–Kutta method for (1.1.1):
it corresponds to (1.1.6) with v = 1,
yn+1 := uh(tn + hn) = yn + hn

j=1
b jYn, j
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1),
(1.1.8)
with b j := β j(1), and the stage equations (1.1.7).
If m ≥2 and if the collocation parameters {ci} are such that
0 = c1 < c2 < . . . < cm = 1,
then tn,1 = tn implies Yn,1 = f (tn, yn), and the CIRK method (1.1.6), (1.1.7)
reduces to

Example 1.1.1 uh ∈S(0)

Since L1(v) ≡1 and β1(v) = v (hence a1,1 = θ and b1 = 1), (1.1.6) reduces to
uh(tn + vhn) = yn + hnvYn,1,
v ∈[0, 1],
with Yn,1 deﬁned by the solution of
Yn,1 = f (tn + θhn, yn + hnθYn,1).
These equations may be combined into a single one (by setting v = 1 in the
expression for uh(tn + vhn) and solving for Yn,1); the resulting method is the

continuous θ-method for (1.1.1),
uh(tn + vhn) = (1 −v)yn + vyn+1,
v ∈[0, 1].
where
yn+1 = yn + hn f (tn + θhn, (1 −θ)yn + θyn+1)
implicitly deﬁnes yn+1.
This family of continuous one-stage Runge–Kutta methods contains the
continuous implicit Euler method (θ = 1) and the continuous implicit mid-
point method (θ = 1/2). For θ = 0 we obtain the continuous explicit Euler
method. Due to its importance in the time-stepping of (spatially) semidiscre-
tised parabolic PDEs (or PVIDEs) we state the continuous implicit midpoint
method for the linear ODE
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + g(t),
t ∈I,
with a and g in C(I). Setting θ = 1/2 we obtain
yn+1 = yn + hn
2 a(tn + hn/2)[yn + yn+1] + g(tn + hn/2)(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1),

(1.1.11)
Observe the difference between (1.1.11) and the continuous trapezoidal
method: the latter corresponds to collocation in the space S(0)
2 (Ih), with
c1 = 0, c2 = 1 being the Lobatto points; it is described in Example 1.1.2 below
(m = 2).
Example 1.1.2 uh ∈S(0)
2 (Ih) (m = 2), with 0 ≤c1 < c2 ≤1:
It follows from L1(v) = (c2 −v)/(c2 −c1), L2(v) = (v −c1)/(c2 −c1) that
β1(v) = v(2c2 −v)
2(c2 −c1) ,
β2(v) = v(v −2c1)
2(c2 −c1) .
Hence, b1 = β1(1) = (2c2−1)/(2(c2−c1)), b2 = β2(1) = (1−2c1)/(2(c2−c1)).
The resulting continuous two-stage Runge–Kutta method thus reads:
uh(tn + vhn) = yn + hn{β1(v)Yn,1 + β2(v)Yn,2},
v ∈[0, 1],
where
Yn,i = f (tn,i, yn + hn{ai,1Yn,1 + ai,2Yn,2}) (i = 1, 2).

The discrete version of this two-stage implicit Runge–Kutta–Gauss method
(of order 4; cf. Section 1.1.3, Corollary 1.1.6) was introduced by Hammer and
Hollingsworth (1955) and generalised by Kuntzmann in 1961 (see Ceschino
and Kuntzmann (1963) for details).
r Radau II points c1 = 1/3, c2 = 1:
Here, we have
β1(v) = 3v(2 −v)/4,
β2(v) = 3v(v −2/3)/4,

1 The collocation method for ODEs: an introduction
Here, Im denotes the identity in L(IRm), An := diag(a(tn,i) )A, and e :=
(1, . . . , 1)T ∈IR m.
The derivation of the analogue of (1.1.15),(1.1.16) corresponding to the sym-
metric formulation (1.1.12),(1.1.13) of the CIRK method is left as an exercise
(Exercise 1.10.1).
The classical conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a solution y ∈
C1(I) to the initial-value problem (1.1.1) (see, e.g. Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner
(1993, Sections I.7–I.9) assure the existence and uniqueness of the collocation
solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to (1.1.1) or its linear counterpart for all h := max(n) hn
in some interval (0, ¯h), provided that fy is bounded (or a and g lie in C(I)
when the ODE is y′ = a(t)y + g(t)). In the latter case, the existence of such
an ¯h follows from the Neumann Lemma which states that (Im −hn An)−1 is
uniformly bounded for all sufﬁciently small hn > 0, so that hn||An|| < 1 for
some (operator) matrix norm. We shall give the precise formulation of this
result in in Chapter 3 (Theorem 3.2.1) for VIDEs which contains the version
for ODEs as a special case.
It is clear that not every implicit Runge–Kutta method can be obtained by
collocation as described above (see, for example, Nørsett (1980), Hairer, Nørsett
and Wanner (1993)): a necessary condition is clearly that the parameters ci
are distinct. The framework of perturbed collocation (Nørsett (1980), Nørsett
and Wanner (1981); see also Section 1.2 below) encompasses all implicit)
Runge–Kutta methods. There is also an elegant connection between continuous
Runge–Kutta methods and discontinuous collocation methods (Hairer, Lubich
and Wanner (2002, pp. 31–34)). The following result (which can be found in
Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner (1993, p. 212)) characterises those implicit Runge–
Kutta methods that are collocation-based.
Theorem 1.1.1 The m-stage implicit Runge–Kutta method deﬁned by (1.1.7)
and (1.1.8), with distinct parameters ci and order at least m, can be obtained
by collocation in S(0)
m (Ih), as described above, if and only if the relations

(i = 1, . . . , m),

The proof of this result is left as an exercise. Recall that a (discrete) Runge–
Kutta method for (1.1.1) is said to be of order p if
|y(t1) −y1| ≤Ch p

1.1 Piecewise polynomial collocation for ODEs

for all sufﬁciently smooth f = f (t, y) in (1.1.1). The next section will reveal
that the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to (1.1.1) is of global order p ≥m
on I.
1.1.2 Convergence and global order on I
Suppose that the collocation equation (1.1.4) deﬁnes a unique collocation so-
lution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for all sufﬁciently small mesh diameters h ∈(0, ¯h). What
are the optimal values of pν and p∗
ν (ν = 0, 1) in the (global and local) error
estimates
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞:= sup
t∈I
|y(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνh pν
(1.1.17)
and
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||h,∞:= max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνh p∗
ν,
(1.1.18)
respectively? These values depend of course on the regularity of the solution
y of the initial-value problem (1.1.1). For arbitrarily regular y we will refer
to the largest attainable pν (ν = 0, 1) as the (optimal) orders of global (super-)
convergence (on the interval I) of uh and u′
h, respectively, and the corresponding
p∗
ν will be called the (optimal) orders of local superconvergence (at the mesh
points Ih \ {0}) of uh and u′
h, provided p∗
ν > pν.
In order to introduce the essential ideas underlying the answer to the above
question regarding the optimal orders, we ﬁrst present the result on global
convergence for the linear initial-value problem
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + g(t),
t ∈I,
y(0) = y0.
(1.1.19)
Theorem 1.1.2 Assume that
(a) the given functions in (1.1.19) satisfy a, g ∈Cm(I);
(b) the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for the initial-value problem (1.1.19)
corresponding to the collocation points Xh is deﬁned by (1.1.15), (1.1.16);
(c) ¯h > 0 is such that, for any h ∈(0, ¯h), each of the linear systems (1.1.16)
has a unique solution.
Then the estimates

depend on the collocation parameters {ci} but are independent of h, and the
exponent m of h cannot in general be replaced by m + 1.
Proof Assumption (a) implies that y ∈Cm+1(I) and hence y′ ∈Cm(I). Thus

m := max( j) ||L j||∞and ¯β := max( j) ||β j||∞. This establishes the de-
sired estimates of Theorem 1.1.2. We note that Guillou and Soul´e (1969) derived
these estimates for the ﬁrst subinterval ¯σ0.
We have presented the proof of the global convergence estimates in Theorem
1.1.2 in some detail because, as we shall soon see, analogous global collocation
error estimates for various types of Volterra integral and integro-differential
equations can be established along very similar lines. In other words, the key to
the proof of such results consists in a suitable local representation (on σn) of the
solution y of the given integral or integro-differential equation which reﬂects
(i) the regularity of y, and (ii) the choice of the (local) basis employed in the
representation of the piecewise polynomial collocation solution uh. Since the
latter is most conveniently chosen to be the local Lagrange basis, the Peano
Kernel Theorem is clearly the appropriate tool for the local representation of y
(or y′), especially if the exact solution does not have full regularity.
Remark The above proof reveals that we could have stated Theorem 1.1.2
under weaker regularity conditions on y: if assumption (a) is replaced by a, g ∈
Cd(I), with 1 ≤d < m (implying y ∈Cd+1(I)), then its proof can be trivially
modiﬁed to show that now uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) satisﬁes only
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cν||y(d+1)||∞hd
(ν = 0, 1).
(1.1.33)
Compare also Theorem 3.2.4 which contains the above result as a special case.
For certain choices of the collocation parameters {ci} we obtain global su-
perconvergence on I; that is, the estimate (1.1.20) holds with m replaced by
m + 1, as is made precise in the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1.3 Assume that the assumptions (b), (c) of Theorem 1.1.2 hold
and let (a) be replaced by a, g ∈Cd(I), with d ≥m + 1. If the m collocation

the interpolatory m-point quadrature formula over [0, 1] whose abscissas are

least) m, while for arbitrary {ci} the degree of precision is only m −1 (see,

implies the uniform boundedness (as h →0) of δh on I, as well as that of its
derivatives of order not exceeding d (compare also Exercise 1.10.4).
Consider now the linear ODE (1.1.19): it follows from (1.1.36) that the
collocation error eh = y −uh satisﬁes the equation
δh(t) = e′
h(t) −a(t)eh(t),
t ∈I.

Hence, using the estimates in Theorem 1.1.2 and the notation in its proof we
readily derive the estimate
||δh||∞≤C1||y(m+1)||∞hm + a0C0||y(m+1)||∞hm ≤D1Mm+1hm,
(1.1.37)
and this holds for any choice of the {ci}. On the other hand, the collocation error
eh solves the initial-value problem

f (t, y) = a(t)y + g(t), and the assumed regularity of a and g (which is inher-
ited by r(t, s)). Due to the special choice of the quadrature abscissas, we have
φn(tℓ+ c jhℓ) = 0, because δh(t) = 0 whenever t ∈Xh. Hence, the equation

Remark In the above proof (cf. (1.1.38)) the representation of the collocation
error in terms of the resolvent r of the (homogeneous) ODE and the subsequent
quadrature argument already give an indication that a much higher order of
convergence may be attained at the mesh points t = tn (local superconvergence
on Ih). Details will be given in the next section, and it will be shown in Sections
2.2.5andSection3.2.4thattheprincipleunderlyingtheanalysisoftheattainable
order of global and local superconvergence extends to Volterra integral and
integro-differential equations, as well as to Volterra functional equations with
non-vanishing delays (Chapter 4).

1.1.3 Local superconvergence results on Ih
We observed in the proof of Theorem 1.1.3 on global superconvergence of the
collocation solution uh that there is a close link between the attainable (optimal)
order on I and the degree of precision of the m-point interpolatory quadrature
formula whose abscissas are the collocation parameters {ci}. The reason (cf.
(1.1.41) and (1.1.38)) that the order of global superconvergence cannot exceed
p = m + 1 is given by the fact that on I \ Xh the defect δh is in general only
O(hm). If, however, we restrict eh to the points of the mesh Ih then, by (1.1.40)
with v = 0, the inequality (1.1.41) reduces to
|eh(tn)| ≤

1 ≤n ≤N,
(1.1.42)
where Qℓ:= max{|E(ℓ)

ℓ
reﬂects the degree of precision of the quadrature formulas governed by (1.1.34),
we are able to replace these terms by hm+κ
ℓ
with 0 ≤κ ≤m, provided that the
collocation parameters {ci} satisfy the more general orthogonality condition

which says that the collocation polynomial Mm(s) is orthogonal with respect to
the polynomial space πκ−1 – implies that the m-point interpolatory quadrature
formula with the m distinct abscissas {ci} has degree of precision m + κ (see,
e.g. Davis and Rabinowitz (1984)). In other words, the quadrature argument
that formed the basis of the the proof of Theorem 1.1.3 now shows that 1.1.42

Theorem 1.1.4 Assume:
(a) The solution of the initial-value problem (1.1.1) lies in Cm+κ(I), for some
κ with 1 ≤κ ≤m and value as speciﬁed in (b) below.
(b) The m distinct collocation parameters {ci} are chosen so that the general
orthogonality condition (1.1.43) holds, with Jκ ̸= 0.

1 The collocation method for ODEs: an introduction
Then, for all meshes Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h), the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih)
corresponding to the collocation points Xh based on these {ci} satisﬁes
max{|y(t) −uh(t)| : t ∈Ih} ≤C0hm+κ,
(1.1.45)
where C0 depends on the collocation parameters and on ||y(m+κ+1)||∞but not
on h.
Moreover, if cm = 1, then
max{|y′(t) −u′
h(t)| : t ∈Ih\{0}} = O(hm+κ),
too. For cm < 1 we only have e′
h(tn) = O(hm) (n = 1, . . . , N).
Proof For linear IVPs, f (t, y) = a(t)y + g(t), with a, g ∈Cm+κ(I), the proof
is obvious from the remarks preceding Theorem 1.1.3. Its extension to nonlinear
initial-value problems (1.1.1) will be studied in Section 1.1.4.
Corollary 1.1.5 For κ = m the (unique) set {ci} of collocation parameters
satifyingtheorthogonalityconditions(1.1.43)isgivenbytheGauss(–Legendre)
points, i.e. the zeros of the (shifted) Legendre polynomial Pm(2s −1), and for
these points we have
max{|y(t) −uh(t)| : t ∈Ih} ≤Ch2m,
while max{|y′(t) −u′
h(t)| : t ∈Ih\{0} = O(hm) only.
Remark It was shown by Kuntzmann in 1961 (see Kuntzmann and Ceschino
(1963)) and by Butcher (1964) that ‘classical’ (discrete) m-stage implicit
Runge–Kutta–Gauss methods have order of convergence p = 2m (see also
Hammer and Hollingsworth (1955) for the case m = 2). The above result for
the corresponding continuous m-stage Runge–Kutta–Gauss methods was es-
tablished by Guillou and Soul´e (1969) and by Wright (1970); see also the 1979
paper by Nørsett and Wanner, and the book by Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner
(1993).
In applications one is often interested in obtaining collocation solutions that
approximate the solution y and its derivative y′ on the mesh Ih with the same
(high) order. As we have shown above, this will not be true for collocation at
the Gauss points (for which cm < 1). This can be seen from the differentiated
form of (1.1.38) at t = tn,
e′
h(tn) = r(tn, tn)δh(tn) +
 tn

∂r(tn, s)

with r(t, t) = 1: while the quadrature argument employed to establish (1.1.44)
can be aplied to the integral term, (1.1.37) shows that δh(tn) = O(hm) only

1.1 Piecewise polynomial collocation for ODEs
19
unless tn (1 ≤n ≤N) is a collocation point. In the linear case (1.1.19) it follows
from
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + δh(t),
t ∈Xh,
that the order of e′
h(t) matches the one of eh(t) at t = tn if and only if δh(tn) = 0;
that is, when cm = 1. (An analogous argument shows that this is also true for
nonlinear problems; see Section 1.1.4.) Thus, κ ≤m −1. This observation
yields the following two corollaries on ‘balanced’ optimal local superconver-
gence.
Corollary 1.1.6 Let κ = m −1 and assume that the collocation parameters
{ci} are the Radau II points, that is, the zeros of Pm(2s −1) −Pm−1(2s −1).
Then the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) has the property that
max
t∈Ih\{0} |e(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνh2m−1
(ν = 0, 1),
(1.1.46)
for all meshes Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h).
If we consider smooth collocation solutions uh ∈S(1)
m (Ih) (m ≥2), corre-
sponding to collocation parameters with c1 = 0 and cm = 1 (compare the re-
mark preceding Theorem 1.1.1), then the optimal local order cannot exceed
2(m −1):
Corollary 1.1.7 Let the {ci} be the Lobatto points (κ = m −2, with m ≥2),
given by the zeros of s(s −1)P′
m−1(2s −1). Then the collocation error eh cor-
responding to the collocation solution uh ∈S(1)
m (Ih) satisﬁes
max
t∈Ih\{0} |e(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνh2(m−1)
(ν = 0, 1)
(1.1.47)
for all h ∈(0, ¯h).
The following section will reveal that all these superconvergence results
remain true for nonlinear initial-value problems.
1.1.4 Nonlinear initial-value problems
If the function
f = f (t, y) describing the initial-value problem y′(t) =
f (t, y(t)) is such that the solution y exists uniquely on I and is in Cm+1(I),
then the global convergence result of Theorem 1.1.2 remains valid for such
nonlinear equations: the role of a(tn,i) in the error equation (1.1.28) is now
assumed by fy(tn,i, ·), where the second argument comes from the application
of the mean-value theorem (i.e. the linear version of Taylor’s Theorem). The
details of the proof are left as an exercise.

20
1 The collocation method for ODEs: an introduction
In order to extend the superconvergence results of Theorems 1.1.3 and 1.1.4
to nonlinear initial-value problems (1.1.1) we may either employ a linearisation
argument in the equation for the collocation error,
e′
h(t) = f (t, y(t)) −{ f (t, uh(t)) −δh(t)},
t ∈I,
(1.1.48)
where uh(t) = y(t) −eh(t), and then use a ‘perturbed’ counterpart of the re-
solven representation of (1.1.38); or we may resort to the nonlinear variation-
of-constants formula of Gr¨obner and Alekseev (see, e.g. Hairer, Nørsett and
Wanner (1993, pp. 96–97)). We will choose the ﬁrst approach and then com-
ment brieﬂy on the second one.
Assuming that fyy(t, y) is bounded for (t, y) ∈I × , we may write
f (t, y(t)) −f (t, y(t) −eh(t)) = fy(t, y(t))eh(t) −(1/2) fyy(t, w(t))e2
h(t),
where, by Taylor’s Theorem, w(t) := y(t) −θeh(t), θ ∈(0, 1). Thus, the error
equation (1.1.48) assumes the form
e′
h(t) = a1(t)eh(t) + a2(t)e2
h(t) + δh(t),
t ∈I, eh(0) = 0,
(1.1.49)
where a1(t) := fy(t, y(t)) and a2(t) := −(1/2) fyy(t, w(t)). Setting r1(t, s) :=
exp(
 t
s a1(v)ds), the solution of this perturbed linear initial-value problem is
given by
eh(t) =
 t
0
r1(t, s)

δh(s) + a2(s)e2
h(s)

ds,
t ∈I,
(1.1.50)
in analogy to (1.1.38). Hence, recalling the quadrature argument of the proof of
Theorem 1.1.3 and the global error estimate of Theorem 1.1.2 we obtain, with
A2 := ||a2||∞,
|eh(tn)| ≤
n−1

ℓ=0
hℓQℓhm+κ
ℓ
+ A2||e2
h||∞
≤QT hm+κ + A2(C0hm)2 = O(hm+κ),
since κ ≤m. This completes the proof.
As we mentioned above, another – more elegant – way of extending the
convergence estimates (1.1.45) to nonlinear problems is based on a nonlinear
version of (1.1.38). This is the nonlinear variation-of-constants formula for
(1.1.48) due to Alekseev (1961) and Gr¨obner (1960) (see, in addition to the
reference mentioned above, the 1973 paper by Wanner and Reitberger, also for
historical references, and Nørsett and Wanner (1981)).
Theorem 1.1.8 Let y = y(t) be the solution of the initial-value problem
y′ = f (t, y),
t ∈I,
y(0) = y0,
(1.1.51)

1.1 Piecewise polynomial collocation for ODEs
21
and let w = w(t) be an approximate solution to y with the same initial value,
that is,
w′ = f (t, w) −g(t, w),
t ∈I,
w(0) = y0,
(1.1.52)
for some g. If fy exists and is continuous on I × IR, and if g = g(t, w) is
(piecewise) continuous, then
w(t) = y(t) +
 t
0
(t, s, w(s))g(s, w(s))ds,
t ∈I.
(1.1.53)
Here, (t, s, w(s)) := (∂/∂w)y(t, s, w(s)) denotes the partial derivative of the
solution y passing through (s, w(s)) with respect to the initial values w(s).
A nice proof of this result can be found in Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner (1993,
pp. 96–97). The application of this result is now obvious: the role of w in (1.1.53)
is assumed by the collocation solution uh, and the initial-value problem (1.1.52)
is given by
u′
h(t) = f (t, uh(t)) −δh(t),
t ∈I,
uh(0) = y0
(recall also (1.1.48)), where the defect δh(t) depends by deﬁnition on uh. The
quadrature argument introduced in the proofs of Theorems 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 can
now be used in (1.1.53) in exactly the same way, supported by our knowledge
of the regularity of the integrand.
1.1.5 Collocation for ‘integrated’ ODEs
When establishing existence and uniqueness results for an initial-value problem
of the form
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)),
t ∈I := [0, T ], y(0) = y0,
(1.1.54)
one resorts to its integrated form,
y(t) = y0 +
 t
0
f (s, y(s))ds,
t ∈I,
(1.1.55)
and then applies Picard iteration. Suppose now that we use the Volterra integral
equation (1.1.55) as the basis for obtaining collocation approximations to the
solution y of (1.1.54). Denote by
S(−1)
m−1(Ih) := {v : v|σn ∈πm−1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}
the space of piecewise polynomials of degree m −1 ≥0 which may be discon-
tinuous at the interior points t1, . . . , tN−1 of the mesh Ih (see also Section 2.2.1

for additional details of these collocation spaces). Since the dimension of this
linear space is
dimS(−1)
m−1(Ih) = Nm = dimS(0)

we may employ the same set Xh of collocation points given by (1.1.3), as there
is now no prescribed initial condition to be satisﬁed.

1.1 Piecewise polynomial collocation for ODEs

In general, the integrals occurring in the above collocation equations (1.1.58)
and (1.1.59) cannot be found analytically and thus will have to be approximated
by suitable quadrature formulas. Suppose that these quadrature formulas are
interpolatory m-point quadrature rules whose abscissas coincide with, or are
based on, the collocation parameters {ci}. Hence,

1 The collocation method for ODEs: an introduction
Comparing the last two equations with (1.1.6) and (1.1.7), the analogous ones
for uh, a simple induction argument shows that Yn,i = ˆWn,i for all i and n, and
hence
uh(t) = ˆvit
h (t) for all t ∈I.
There is a way of avoiding the use of quadrature approximations when
employing collocation for the integrated IVP (1.1.55). Suppose the integral
equation (1.1.55) is written in implicitly linear form: deﬁning z(t) := f (t, y(t)),
it becomes
y(t) = y0 +

t ∈I
(1.1.66)
(which is a simple example of a Volterra–Hammerstein equation; see Section
2.3). We now approximate the solution z of this nonlinear integral equation
(1.1.66) by the collocation solution zh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), using the same collocation
points Xh as before. With the local representation
zh(tn + vhn) =

the corresponding collocation equation becomes

with (1.1.66), (1.1.65) and (1.1.6), (1.1.7) readily reveals, the following is true.
Theorem 1.1.9 Let uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) denote the ‘direct’ collocation solution to the
initial-value problem 1.1.54), and let yh and ˆvit
h be the implicitly linear collo-
cation aproximations to (1.1.55) deﬁned by (1.1.66) and (1.1.68), respectively.
Then, for all sufﬁciently small h > 0,
uh(t) = yh(t) = ˆvit
h (t),
t ∈I.
If in (1.1.54) we have f (t, y) = ay for some constant a ̸= 0, then the inter-
polatory quadrature formulas used in the discretisation of (1.1.58) and (1.1.59)
are exact. This leads to the following
Corollary 1.1.10 Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1.9 we have, for
(1.1.54) with f (t, y) = ay,
uh(t) = vit
h (t),
t ∈I.
Remarks
1. Local superconvergence results for collocation-based implicit Runge–Kutta
methods applied to the integrated form of the given initial-value problem
were ﬁrst derived by Axelsson (1969) for the Radau and Lobatto points.
The reader is also referred to the results in Theorems 5.3.5 and 5.3.6
(for q = 1) which reveal more explicitly, and in a more general setting, the
connection between uh(t), vh(t) and vit
h (t) at t = h.
2. The nonlinear Volterra integral operator of (1.1.55) is a special case of a
Volterra–Hammerstein integral operator. Its general form is
(Hy)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds,
t ∈I,
where G is a (usually smooth) function from I ×  ⊂IR →IR. We shall
study collocation methods for this important class of nonlinear second-kind
Volterra integral equations in Section 2.3.3 (for bounded kernels K(t, s)),
Section 4.3.4 (VH equations with non-vanishing delays), and Section 6.2.9
(VH equations with weakly singular kernels).

1.1.6 Pad´e approximations to exp(z)
There is a close connection between the attainable order of local superconver-
gence (and the asymptotic stability) of the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) on
Ih and certain Pad´e approximants to the exponential function f (z) = exp(z) –
which, for z := ah, is the solution at t = h of the initial-value problem
y′(t) = ay(t),
y(0) = 1.
Since this connection will also play a role in Chapter 5 we brieﬂy describe its
main points. Additional details may be found in, e.g. Iserles and Nørsett (1991)
and Hairer and Wanner (1996).
Deﬁnition Let f = f (z) be a complex function that is analytic at z = 0 and
denote, for given non-negative integers k, ℓ, by πk/ℓthe set of all rational
functions of the form P/Q where P and Q (with Q(0) = 1) are polynomials
of degree not exceeding k and ℓ, respectively. A function Rk/ℓ∈πk/ℓis called
a [k/ℓ]-Pad´e approximant to f if
Rk/ℓ(z) −f (z) = O(z p∗+1) near z = 0,
with
p∗:= max{ρ : R ∈πk/ℓ
so that
R(z) −f (z) = O(zρ+1)}.
It can be shown that p∗≥k + ℓimplies that the Pad´e approximant Rk/ℓis
unique. This is in particular the case for f (z) = exp(z): here, p∗= k + ℓ. In
the following we will use the notation Rk/ℓto denote rational functions in πk/ℓ
which are [k/ℓ]-Pad´e approximants while Rk,ℓwill be a generic element of
πk/ℓ.
The following lemma describes the general form of Pad´e approximants to
exp(z).
Lemma 1.1.11 Let k and ℓbe given non-negative integers. Then the [k, ℓ]-Pad´e
approximant to f (z) = exp(z) is given by
Rk/ℓ(z) = Pk,ℓ(z)/Qk,ℓ(z),
(1.1.69)
with
Pk,ℓ(z) :=

1.1 Piecewise polynomial collocation for ODEs
27
Suppose now that we solve the linear ODE
y′(t) = ay(t),
t ∈I,
y(0) = y0 = 1,
(1.1.70)
by collocation in S(0)
m (Ih), with uniform mesh Ih and collocation points Xh de-
scribed by {ci : 0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1}. It follows from the collocation equa-
tion
u′
h(t) = auh(t),
t ∈Xh,
uh(0) = 1,
(1.1.71)
and its computational form for the subinterval [0, t1 = h],


j=1
L j(v)U0, j,
v ∈[0, 1],
at t = t1 = h can be expressed in the form
uh(h) = pm(z)/qm(z) =: Rm,m(z),
z := ah,
where the right-hand side is a rational function whose numerator pm and de-
nominator qm are polynomials of degree not exceeding m. This rational function
is obviously an approximation (or, more precisely, an interpolant) to the exact
solution y(h) = exp(z) of (1.1.70) at t = h. For special choices of the colloca-
tion parameters {ci} the rational approximant is a Pad´e approximant to exp(z).
We mention the two most important cases:
1. If the collocation parameters {ci} are the Gauss points (corresponding to the
zeros of the shifted Legendre polynomial Pm(2s −1)), then the resulting
rational approximation Rm,m(z) is the the Pad´e approximant is Rm/m(z) for
exp(z).
2. For the Radau II points (given by the zeros of Pm(2s −1) −Pm−1(2s −1))
we obtain the Pad´e approximant Rm,m(z) = R(m−1)/m(z).
We summarise these facts in the next lemma; we shall return to its result (and
its proof) in Section 5.2.3.
Lemma 1.1.12 Let M(s) = Mm(s) := (1/m!) m
i=1(s −ci) denote the collo-
cation polynomial associated with the collocation parameters {ci}. Then the
value of the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to (1.1.70) at t = h is given by

m
j=0 M(m−j)(1)z j
m
j=0 M(m−j)(0)z j ,
(1.1.73)
with z := ah. If the {ci} are the m Gauss points, then Rm,m(z) is the [m/m]-
Pad´e approximant Rm/m(z) to y(h) = exp(z), as described in Lemma 1.1.11: it
is given by

m!(2m −j)!(−z) j
(m −j)!(2m)! j! ,
(1.1.75)
and hence
y(h) −uh(h) = O(h2m+1).
If the {ci} are the Radau II points, then
Rm−1/m(z) = Pm−1,m(z)/Qm−1,m(z),
with the polynomials Pm−1,m(z) and Qm−1,m(z) obtained from Lemma 1.1.11
by replacing k by m −1 and ℓby m. We now have
y(h) −uh(h) = O(h2m).
Analogous results hold for the Radau I points (zeros of Pm(2s −1) +
Pm−1(2s −1), yielding Rm/(m−1)(z)) and the Lobatto points (zeros of s(s −
1)P′
m−1(2s −1); leading to R(m−2)/m(z)). Details and proofs of these classical
results may be found in in the books by Lambert (1991), Iserles and Nørsett
(1991, pp. 48–51), Strehmel and Weiner (1992, pp. 75–76), Hairer and Wanner
(1996), or in the papers by Guillou and Soul´e (1969), Axelsson (1969), and
Wright (1970). The comprehensive theory of so-called C-polynomials under-
lying the above result is is due to Nørsett (1975); see also the generalisation in
Iserles (1981).
We shall see in Chapter 5 (Theorem 5.2.7 and Theorem 5.2.8) that the result
of Lemma 1.1.12 will no longer be valid if the ODE y′(t) = ay(t) is replaced
by a (seemingly closely related) delay differential equation with proportional
(vanishing) delay,
y′(t) = by(qt),
0 < q < 1,
t ≥0.

1.2 Perturbed collocation methods

1.2 Perturbed collocation methods
We have seen at the beginning of Section 1.1 that the (continuous) implicit
m-stage Runge–Kutta methods generated by collocation for (1.1.1) in S(0)
m (Ih)
form a proper subset of all implicit m-stage RK Methods. Since this insight
leads to a very elegant analysis of the optimal superconvergence properties
of methods from this subset, there arises the question of whether a similar
approach is possible for other implicit RK methods. Nørsett (1980) and Nørsett
and Wanner (1981) introduced such a framework in the form of perturbed
collocation methods which we will brieﬂy describe in his section.
Deﬁnition

j=1

n,
t ∈¯σn (0 ≤n ≤N −1),
(1.2.2)
is called a perturbation operator with respect to the mesh Ih = {tn : 0 =
t0 < t1 < . . . < tN = T }.
(b) Let {ci} be a given set of m distinct points in [0, 1] and let Pn,h be the per-
turbation operator introduced in (1.2.2). The perturbed collocation method
corresponding to Pn,h consists in ﬁnding uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) so that
uh(tn) = yn,
u′
h(tn + cihn) = f (tn + cihn, (Pn,huh)(tn + cihn) (i = 1, . . . , m),
yn+1 := uh(tn + hn) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1).
(1.2.3)
Remark The choice N j(t) ≡0 ( j = 1, . . . , m) obviously reduces (1.2.3) to
the ‘classical’ collocation method (1.1.7),(1.1.8), since Pn,h is now the identity
operator.
We observe also that if to each polynomial N j(t) we add an arbitrary con-
stant multiple of the collocation polynomial Mm(s) := (1/m!) m
k=1(s −ck)
(corresponding to t = tn + shn ∈¯σn), the method (1.2.3) remains unchanged
because Mm(s) vanishes for each s = ci.

The entries pi, j in Pm are the coefﬁcients occurring in (1.2.1).
The proof of this result is straightforward. It, and the one for Theorem 1.1.2,
can also be found in Nørsett and Wanner (1981).
We have the following converse of Theorem 1.2.1, in which a RK method
will be called interpolatory if (1.2.6) holds.
Theorem 1.2.2 Consider any m-stage interpolatory RK method with distinct
parameters {ci}. Then this method is equivalent to a perturbed collocation
method (1.2.3).

1.3 Collocation in smoother piecewise polynomial spaces
31
We conclude this brief description of perturbed collocation methods with a
result on the attainable order (Nørsett and Wanner (1981)).
Theorem 1.2.3 Assume that for given integers l and κ ≤m we have:
(a) N j(t) ≡0 for j = 1, . . . ,l −1, and N j has exact degree j for j =
l, . . . , m;
(b)

sν N j(s)ds = 0 for j = l, . . . , m; ν = 0, . . . , m + κ −j −1;
(c)
 1
0
sν Mm(s)ds = 0 for ν = 0, . . . , κ −1;
(d) 2l ≥m + κ.
Then the perturbed collocation method has order p∗≥m + κ on the mesh Ih.
The proof can again be based on the nonlinear variation-of-constants formula
of Alekseev and Gr¨obner (cf. Theorem 1.1.8): now, the defect is given by
δh(t) := −u′
h(t) + f (t, (Pn,huh)(t)),
t ∈¯σn.
However, the argument (degree of (piecewise) regularity of δh, etc.) is rather
more complex than in the classical case. The reader is referred to Nørsett and
Wanner (1981) for details; see also Exercise 1.10.7 for the case of a linear ODE.
1.3 Collocation in smoother piecewise polynomial spaces
1.3.1 Divergence of collocation solutions
What can be said about the aproximation properties of collocation solutions
uh that lie in smooth collocation spaces S(d)
µ (Ih) with µ ≥2 and 1 ≤d < µ?
It was shown by Loscalzo and Talbot (1967) (compare also Loscalzo (1968,
1969), Hung (1970), and Schoenberg’s 1974 survey paper) that collocation
in the ‘classical’ spline space S(3)
4 (Ih) (which corresponds, in the notation of
Section 2.1, to S(d)
m+d(Ih) with m = 1, d = 3) at the collocation points tn +
c1hn based on the single collocation parameter c1 = 1 is divergent. On the
other hand, Callender (1971) proved that collocation in S(1)
µ (Ih (µ ≥2) leads to
convergent collocation solutions when the {ci} are equidistant: ci = i/(µ −1)
(i = 1, . . . , µ −1).
Piecewise polynomial collocation methods where some (or all) of the col-
location parameters coalesce were brieﬂy considered by Guillou and Soul´e
(1969, pp. 24–26). Important related work was carried out by Kastlunger and
Wanner (1972) on implicit Tur´an–Runge–Kutta methods; see also Chapter II.13

1 The collocation method for ODEs: an introduction
of Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner (1993). A comprehensive divergence and con-
vergence analysis was provided by M¨ulthei in the late 1970s and the early 1980s
(see especially M¨ulthei (1979, 1980a)).
Here, we summarise his results on the divergence of piecewise polynomial
collocation solutions uh, including Hermite-type methods where some of the
collocation points have multiplicity greater than one. See also Nørsett (1984)
for a good overview and numerous examples.
Let uh ∈S(d)
µ (Ih) where the mesh Ih is supposed to be uniform. The di-
mension of this linear space is N(µ −d) + (d + 1) (see Section 2.2.1). Set
q := µ −d (this integer is sometimes called the defect of the piecewise poly-
nomial spline space S(d)
µ (Ih)), and let c1, . . . , cr, with 0 < c1 < . . . < cr = 1,
be given collocation parameters with multiplicities δi ≥1, where
r

i=1
δi = q = µ −d.
Instead of using local representations of uh on ¯σn based on Hermite canonical
polynomials (see, e.g. Hairer, Nørsett and Wanner (1993, pp. 274–276)), it will
be more convenient for our purpose to write

j=d+1
αn, jv j,
v ∈[0, 1],
with y(l)

h (tn). The collocation equation for uh at tn,i := tn + cihn ∈σn is
u(ν)
h (tn,i) = (ν−1)(tn,i, uh(tn,i)),
ν = 1, . . . , δi;
i = 1, . . . ,r,
where

InthemethodsofLoscalzoandTalbot(1967)wehaved = µ −1andc1 = 1;
hence q = 1, δ1 = 1 and r = 1. The generalisation encompasses two possibil-
ities:
(I) q = µ −d > 1, but c1 = 1 with δ1 = q: this corresponds to Hermite collo-
cation at t = tn+1 (n = 0, . . . , N −1).
(II) q = µ −d > 1, with 1 < r ≤q, δi ≥1. If r = µ −d then all the param-
eters ci have multiplicity one.
We consider ﬁrst the case (I) where c1 = · · · = cr = 1, generalising the
original approach by Loscalzo and Talbot. In the ﬁrst paper of M¨ulthei (1979)
the following general result was proved.
Theorem 1.3.1 Let uh ∈S(d)

each
having
multiplicity
q := µ −d.
The
uh is divergent, as h →0 (Nh = T ) whenever
µ ≥2(q + 1),
or, equivalently, if
d ≥q + 2.
For collocation in the classical spline space S(3)
4 (Ih) (corresponding to
µ = 4, d = 3 and hence to q = 1) collocation at t = tn+1 (c1 = 1) leads to a
divergent collocation solution uh. This is the result due to Loscalzo and Talbot
(1967). More generally, we have:
Corollary 1.3.2 If uh ∈S(µ−1)
µ
(Ih) (q = 1) and c1 = 1, then uh diverges, as
h →0, whenever µ ≥4.
If there are interior collocation points present, the divergence/convergence of
the collocation solution may or may not depend on the location of these points.
The following general divergence result was proved in M¨ulthei (1980b); it uses
the above assumptions and notation.
Theorem 1.3.3 (i) Assume that d ≥q + 1 + δr,1, where δi, j denotes the Kro-
necker symbol. Then the collocation solution uh ∈S(d)
µ (Ih) is divergent,
regardless of the location of the (interior) collocation parameters.
(ii) If we have ci = i/r (i = 1, . . . ,r −1) and δr−i ≤δi (i = 1, . . . , ⌊(r −
1)/2⌋), then uh is divergent whenever d ≥δr + 2.
The last theorem (M¨ulthei (1980b)) shows that for non-equally spaced col-
location parameters {ci} the convergence/divergence of the collocation solution
will in general depend on their location in (0, 1).
Theorem 1.3.4 Assume that the degree of regularity d in S(d)
µ (Ih) satisﬁes d =
δr + 1 (≥2), with r > 1. Then the collocation solution uh is divergent if

ﬁrst three papers of 1980.

1.3.1).
Example 1.3.3 uh ∈S(2)
4 (Ih):
Here we have µ = 4, d = q = 2, and the dimension of this linear space is
2N + 3. If the collocation parameters are chosen so that 0 < c1 < c2 = 1, then
the collocation solution uh is divergent whenever
1 −c1
c1

that is, when c1 < 1/2.
Example 1.3.4 uh ∈S(2)
5 (Ih):
This space corresponds to µ = 5, d = 2, q = 3, and its dimension is 3N + 3.
For
0 < c1 < c2 < c3 = 1,
we have r = 3 and d = 2 = δr + 1. The collocation solution is divergent when-

The last two examples reveal that collocation in S(2)
µ (Ih) (µ ≥4), with the µ −2
parameters {ci} given by the Radau II points, leads to divergence.
We summarise this general divergence result in the following corollary.
Corollary 1.3.5 Let uh ∈S(2)
µ (Ih) (µ ≥4) be the collocation solution corre-
sponding to the µ −2 Radau II points {ci} in (0, 1]. Then uh is divergent.
Proof The Radau II points are the zeros of Pµ−2(2s −1) −Pµ−3(2s −1).
The corresponding points cI
i := 1 −cµ−1−i(i = 1, . . . , µ −2) are the Radau I
points (given by the zeros of Pµ−2(2s −1) + Pµ−3(2s −1)). Thus, we may

and by Theorem 1.3.4 (with δi = 1 and r = q = µ −2).

Let k ≥2 be a given integer and consider the initial-value problem

(1.4.10)
As in the case k = 1 these results remain valid for the nonlinear problem (1.4.1),
provided it has a sufﬁciently regular solution on I (see also Chapter 3 and the
remark following Theorem 1.4.3). The ﬁrst theorem describes the attainable
order of global convergence for arbitrarily chosen collocation points.
Theorem 1.4.1 Assume that the given functions aν (0 ≤ν ≤k −1) and g in
the linear ODE (1.4.10) are m times continuously differentiable on I. Then for
all sufﬁciently small h > 0 and any {ci} we have the estimates
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cνhm
(ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1)
and
sup
t∈I
|y(k)(t) −u(k)
h (t)| ≤Ckhm.
For certain special sets {ci} we obtain global superconvergence on I, as
described in the following theorem.

The comments in Section 1.1.1 motivating the use of the ‘natural’ collocation
space S(0)
m (Ih) when k = 1 imply that we will now seek the collocation solution
for (1.4.1) in the smooth piecewise polynomial space
S(d)
m+d(Ih) := {v ∈Cd(I) : v| ¯σn ∈πm+d (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}
with d = k −1 ≥1 (see also Section 2.2.1). The dimension of this linear vector
space is

m+d(Ih) = Nm + d + 1 = Nm + k.
Let Xh, the set of collocation points in I deﬁned in (1.1.3). The collocation
solution uh in this space for (1.4.1) is thus deﬁned by

This allows us to write down the computational form of the collocation equa-

instead of doing this in complete generality we illustrate this for the important
case k = 2.

Theorem 1.4.2 Assume that the given functions aν (0 ≤ν ≤k −1) and g in

holds. Then the collocation solution uh ∈S(d)

all sufﬁciently small h > 0,
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cνhm+1
(ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1).
While the collocation solution uh and its derivatives u′
h, . . . , u(k−1)
h
are glob-
ally superconvergent on I, with order p∗= m + 1, we only have O(hm)-
convergence for u(k)
h on I.
This result suggests (recalling the proof for the case k = 1) that local super-
convergence, of order up to 2m, at the mesh points is also possible.
Theorem 1.4.3 Let aν ∈Cm+κ(I) (0 ≤ν ≤k −1), g ∈Cm+κ(I), for some κ
with 1 ≤κ ≤m, and assume that the {ci} satisfy

i=1
(s −ci)ds = 0,
ℓ= 0, 1, . . . , κ −1,

tion solution uh ∈S(k−1)
m+k−1(Ih) and its derivatives u(ν)
h
(ν = 1, . . . , k −1) are
superconvergent on the mesh Ih:
max
t∈Ih |y(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνhm+κ
(ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1).
In particular, κ = m (implying that the {ci} are the m Gauss points in (0, 1))
leads to
max
t∈Ih |y(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνh2m
(ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1).
If κ = m −1 and cm = 1 (corresponding to the Radau II points in (0, 1]), then
local superconvergence of order 2m −1 holds also for u(k)
h at the points Ih \ {0}:
we now have
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(ν)(t) −uν
h(t)| ≤Cνh2m−1
(ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1, k).
We will see in Chapter 3 that these results can be viewed as corollaries to
analogous statements for Volterra integro-differential equations of order k ≥2,
y(k)(t) = f (t, y(t), y′(t), . . . , y(k−1)(t)) + (V(k y)(t),

The details will be presented in Section 3.2.5 (Theorems 3.2.12 and 3.2.13).
1.5 Multistep collocation
We have seen in Section 1.2 that if uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is obtained by collocation at the
Gauss points then it is locally superconvergent (on Ih) of order p∗= 2m. Since
the numerical implementation of the collocation method will become rather
expensive for large m and, especially, for systems of ODEs resulting from the
semidiscretisation in space of (parabolic) PDEs, there arises the question of
‘cheaper’ collocation methods of comparable order. The multistep collocation
methods (introduced by Lie (1990) and Lie and Nørsett (1989) in the late 1980s;
see also Hairer and Wanner (1996, pp. 270–278)) – which contain as special
cases the one-leg methods of Dahlquist (1983) and the BDF methods – represent
a possible alternative. These methods form themselves a particular class of so-
called general linear methods introduced by Butcher (see, e.g. Butcher (1987,
Chapter 4) or Hairer and Wanner (1996, pp. 290–295)).
A µ-step collocation method is based on piecewise polynomials uh ∈
S(0)
m+µ−1(Ih) (µ ≥2), and uh is deﬁned by the µ-step collocation equations
uh(tℓ) = yℓ
(ℓ= n −µ + 1, . . . , n),
(1.5.1)
u′
h(tn + cih) = f (tn + cih, uh(tn + cih)) (i = 1, . . . , m),
(1.5.2)
where we have assumed for simplicity that the underlying mesh Ih is uniform.
On the interval [tn−µ+1, tn+1] the collocation solution is described by
uh(tn + vh) =
µ

k=1
φk(v)yn−µ−k + h
m

j=1
ψ j(v)Yn, j
(1.5.3)
with Yn, j := u′
h(tn + c jh). The functions φk and ψ j are the canonical Hermite
polynomials (observe that the above problem may be viewed as an incomplete
Hermite interpolation problem for uh and u′
h) deﬁned by
φk(ℓ) := δℓ,k
φ′
k(ci) := 0

and
ψ j(ℓ) := 0
ψ j(ci) := δi, j

.
It is a consequence of (incomplete) Hermite (–Birkhoff) interpolation theory
(see, e.g. Lorentz et al. (1983)) that, in contrast to one-step collocation, the
multistep collocation solution need not exist. An analysis of this problem of

1.5 Multistep collocation
39
existence and uniqueness is given in Lie and Nørsett (1989) and in Hairer and
Wanner (1996). However, Lie and Nørsett have shown that there exist µ-step
collocation methods whose (optimal) order of local superconvergence is given
by p∗= 2m + µ −1 > 2m. They correspond to sets {ci} which are the abscis-
sas of µ-step Gauss quadrature formulas (see, e.g. Krylov (1962)). The global
convergence of µ-step collocation methods is due to Lie (1990). Examples of
such µ-step collocation methods, especially for µ = 2, are presented in Lie and
Nørsett (1989, pp. 77–78). Here, we mention without proof the following re-
sult which represents the µ-step analogue of the local superconvergence result
(1.1.45) in Theorem 1.1.4:
Theorem 1.5.1 For given collocation parameters {ci : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤
1} let Mm(s) := (1/m!) m
i=1(s −ci). Assume that µ ≥2 and deﬁne the deter-
minants D(µ)

by



.
Then the µ-step collocation solution deﬁned by (1.5.1)–(1.5.3), if it exists, has
local order p∗= m + µ −1 + κ (κ ≤m) on Ih if, and only if, the {ci} are such
that
D(µ)
ν
= 0
for
ν = 0, 1, . . . , κ −1.
Note that for µ = 1 the above theorem reduces to the ﬁrst part of Theorem
1.1.4.
As Lie and Nørsett (1989) have shown, this result can be derived either by a
suitable adaptation of the Alekseev–Gr¨obner (nonlinear) variation-of-constants
formula, or by an algebraic approach based on the interpolation conditions un-
derlying the method. The latter leads to the following alternative characterisa-
tion of the order of local superconvergence.

1.6 The discontinuous Galerkin method for ODEs
It was shown by Lesaint and Raviart (1974) that there is a close connection
between (collocation based) implicit Runge–Kutta methods and the discontin-
uous Galerkin (dG) method for (1.1.1). In order to describe the dG method we
introduce the following notation. For a given mesh Ih let
[φ]n := φ(t+
n ) −φ(t−
n )
denote the jump of the function φ at the (interior) mesh point t = tn, and set
V (Ih) := {φ ∈L2(I) : φ|σn is continuous and bounded}.
The weak form of the (scalar) ODE (1.1.1) is then given by: ﬁnd y ∈C1(I) so
that, for each φ ∈V (Ih),
N−1

n=0


n=1
[y]nφ(t+
n ) + y(t+
0 )φ(t+
0 ) = y0φ(t+
0 ).
(1.6.1)
(An analogous deﬁnition holds for systems of the form (1.1.1.): if y ∈IRd then
the above products are replaced by the corresponding inner products in IRd.)
Equation (1.6.1) forms the basis for the dG method: given the ﬁnite-dimensional
subspace Vh(Ih) = S(−1)
m
(Ih) of V (Ih) we wish to ﬁnd uh ∈Vh(Ih) so that, for
all φ ∈Vh(Ih),

n=1
[uh]nφ(t+
n ) + uh(t+
0 )φ(t+
0 ) = y0φ(t+
0 ).
(1.6.2)
The approximation uh deﬁned in this way is called the discontinuous Galerkin
solution to the initial-value problem (1.1.1) in the space S(−1)
m
(Ih). Its existence
and uniqueness can be established in complete analogy to that for the collocation
solution (see, e.g. Johnson (1988) or Sch¨otzau and Schwab (2000) for a general
analysis); this will also become clear from the subsequent discussion.
Although (1.6.2) appears to be a ‘global’ equation on I, we will now
show that it represents in fact a time-stepping method similar to the collo-
cation method. This computational form of (1.6.2) says: ﬁnd a polynomial

holds for all φ ∈πm(σn) and n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1. Recall that u0,h(t−

Suppose now that the integrals in (1.6.3) are approximated by interpolatory
(m + 1)-point quadrature formulas with abscissas tn, j := tn + c jhn (0 =: c0 <
c1 < . . . < cm ≤1) and weights w j ( j = 0, 1, . . . , m). We denote the resulting
discretised dG solution in S(−1)
m
(Ih) by ˆuh and write ˆun,h for its restriction to the
subinterval σn. The fully discretised version of (6.1.3) is then given by

−ˆun,h(t−
n )φ(t−
n ) = 0,
(1.6.4)
for all φ ∈πm(σn). For ease of notation we will omit the subscript n in ˆun,h. Let
ˆyn := ˆuh(t−
n ),
ˆUn,0 := ˆuh(t+
n ),
ˆUn, j := ˆuh(tn, j) ( j = 1, . . . , m),
and let L j(v) be the jth Lagrange canonical polynomial (of degree m −1)
corresponding to the points {ci : i = 1, . . . , m}. Moreover, denote by {φ j :
j = 0, 1, . . . , m} a (canonical) basis for πm(σn) so that
φi(tn + c jhn) = δi, j
(i, j = 0, 1, . . . , m).
Since the restriction of ˆu′
h to σn is a polynomial of degree m −1 we may write
ˆu′
h(tn + vhn) =

h(tn,0) −f (tn,0, ˆuh(tn,0)] + ˆuh(t+

nonlinear algebraic equations for ˆUn := ( ˆUn,0, ˆUn,1, . . . , ˆUn,m)T ∈IR m+1, with
ˆUn,0 := ˆuh(t+
n ): they closely resemble the ones corresponding to collocation at
the points {tn,0, tn,1, . . . , tn,m}.
We now show that these equations may indeed be interpreted as the
stage equations of an implicit (m + 1)-stage Runge–Kutta method. Let b j :=

because our interpolatory (m + 1)-point quadrature formula is exact for poly-

and hence, by (1.6.5), to the time-stepping equation

m + 1 stages for the initial-value problem (1.1.1).

1.7 Spectral and pseudo-spectral methods
Spectral methods (which have their origins in the numerical solution of
boundary-value problems; see, e.g. Mercier (1989), Funaro (1992), Fornberg
(1996), Boyd (2000), and Trefethen (2000)) are based on ﬁnite expansions, in
terms of orthogonal functions, approximating the unknown solution. These ap-
proximating series employ Fourier expansions or expansions involving certain
orthogonal polynomials. If algebraic or orthogonal polynomials are used, and if
the unknown coefﬁcients are determined by collocation (at feasible points in I)
then the method is called a pseudo-spectral method. One of their most prominent
features is the exponential convergence of the resulting approximations.
Numerical evidence shows (Kauthen (1998), personal communication) that
(pseudo-)spectral methods represent a class of numerical methods for Volterra
integral and integro-differential equations that are potentially superior to the
piecewise collocation methods described in the following chapters. This is
intuitively not surprising, given their success in the numerical treatment of
(ordinary and partial) differential equations. However, their analysis remains to
be carried out.
1.8 The Peano theorems for interpolation and quadrature
In this section we brieﬂy review two important special cases of the celebrated
Peano Kernel Theorem due to Giuseppe Peano (1913). The books by Stroud
(1974), Davis (1975), and Powell (1981) offer good introductions to this im-
portant tool in analysis.
We start with Peano’s Theorem on the representation of the interpolation
error.
Theorem 1.8.1 Assume:
(a) For given abscissas a ≤ξ1 < . . . < ξm ≤b, let
em( f ; t) := f (t) −
m

j=1
L j(t) f (ξ j),
t ∈[a, b]
denote the error between f and the Lagrange interpolation polynomial of
degree m −1 with respect to the given points {ξ j};
(b)
f ∈Cd[a, b] with 1 ≤d ≤m.
Then em( f ; t) possesses the integral representation
em( f ; t) =

t ∈[a, b],

Proofs of this important result (as well as of Theorem 1.8.3) may be found
for example in Stroud (1974) or Powell (1981); consult also the Notes in Section
1.11 for remarks on more general (abstract) versions of Peano’s Theorem.
If the Peano kernel Kd(t, ·) has constant sign in [a, b], we may use the Mean-
Value Theorem for integrals to write the above error representation (1.8.1) as
em( f ; t) = f (d)(ξ)

t ∈[a, b],
for some ξ ∈[a, b], and this permits the derivation of error bounds of the type

In the context of estimating global errors in piecewise polynomial colloca-
tion methods the role of f will be taken either by y or by y′, and we have
[a, b] = [tn, tn+1], ξ j = tn + c jhn (0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1). In view of these
applications we state

1 The collocation method for ODEs: an introduction
1.9 Preview: Collocation for Volterra equations
Formally,thecollocationapproachdescribedforinitial-valueproblemsinODEs
is readily extended to integral equations or integro-differential equations of
Volterra type,
y(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I := [t0, T ],
(1.9.1)
or
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I,
(1.9.2)
where Vα denotes a Volterra integral operator given by
(Vαy)(t) :=
 t
t0
(t −s)−αk(t, s, y(s))ds
(0 ≤α < 1),
and to delay problems, for example to
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t))) + (Wθ,αy)(t),
t ∈I.
(1.9.3)
Here, the delay τ(t) in the lag function θ(t) = t −τ(t) may be non-vanishing,
τ(t) ≥τ0 > 0 for t ∈I, or vanishing, when θ(t) = qt = t −(1 −q)t (0 <
q < 1) with t0 = 0. The delay integral operator Wθ,α has the form
(Wθ,αy)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)
(t −s)−αk2(t, s, y(s), y′(s))ds.
In the case of (1.9.1) we will study, in Chapter 2 (α = 0) and Chapter 6
(α ∈(0, 1])), the convergence properties of collocation solutions in S(−1)
m−1(Ih)
and corresponding iterated collocation solutions,
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I,
thus generalising the basic results of Section 1.1.5. Solutions of classical and
functional Volterra integro-differential equations (1.9.2) will be approximated
in the now familiar collocation space S(0)
m (Ih). However, numerous new prob-
lems and questions will be encountered:
r The presence of the ‘memory terms’ corresponding to the Volterra integral
operators will in general necessitate a second discretisation step, consisting
of suitable quadrature processesses for the integral terms in the ‘exact’ col-
location equations. How does this affect the (order of) convergence of the
resulting ‘discretised’ collocation solution?
r Weakly singular kernels lead, for smooth data, to solutions y which have very
low regularity at t = t0 (unbounded y′ for (1.9.1); unbounded y′′ for (1.9.2)).
Thus, the use of uniform meshes yields collocation solutions with low order

of convergence, regardless of the choice of m or the collocation parameters
{ci}. Are there ways to restore the optimal orders we had for smooth solutions,
by a suitable choice of the mesh (reﬂecting the non-smooth behaviour of y),
or by working in a different (non-polynomial) collocation space?
r The presence of non-vanishing delays θ in a given Volterra equation neces-
sitates a judicious choice of the mesh if uh is to exhibit the optimal order
of convergence, since – for reasons different from those above – the exact
solution y will have low regularity at certain ‘primary discontinuity points’
induced by θ.
r Vanishing delays like θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1) on I = [0, T ] increase the com-
plexity of the analysis (especially of local superconvergence properties of uh
very signiﬁcantly, due to (initial) ‘overlap’ of the collocation points tn + cihn
and the points q(tn + cihn) (i = 1, . . . , m). We will see that the classical
local superconvergence results (e.g. ‘O(h2m) for the Gauss points’) are no
longer true: the reason underlying this fact is that the solutions to such
delay problems can no longer be represented by a variation-of-constants
formula.
r First-kind Volterra integral equations are known to be (mildly) ill-posed and
hence, again not surprisingly, collocation solutions in piecewise polynomial
spaces will no longer be convergent for arbitrary {ci}. This fact will have
important implications in the convergence analysis for ‘mixed’ systems of
Volterra equations (now usually referred to as integral-algebraic equations;
cf. Gear (1990)), consisting of second-kind Volterra integral equations or
Volterra integro-differential equations, and one or more Volterra integral
equations of the ﬁrst kind (Chapter 8). Here, we may paraphrase the title
of Petzold’s 1982 paper, by saying that ‘IAEs are not VIEs’.

1.11 Notes
The principal aim of the notes given at the end of each chapter is to comple-
ment the annotated bibliography. While providing additional information on
results cited in that chapter (including their history), they will focus mostly on
references dealing with topics not discussed in the book and should be read
‘hand-in-hand’ with the bibliography.
1.1: Piecewise polynomial collocation for ODEs
Collocation methods were introduced for boundary-value problems in lin-
ear partial differential equations by Kantorovich in 1934. The analysis of
their convergence properties has its origin in the work by Karpilovskaya of
1953 and 1963, and – especially – by Vainikko from 1965 onwards, while
the ‘modern’ analysis of collocation methods in spaces of piecewise poly-
nomials began with the papers by Russell and Shampine (1972) and by de
Boor and Swartz (1973). An excellent historical survey, accompanied by a
chronological list of references, was given by Matth¨aus (1980). The book
by Ascher, Mattheij and Russell (1995, pp. 213–226) contains a good in-
troduction to collocation methods for two-point BVPs; see also the papers
by Ascher and Weiss (1983, 1984) and by Auzinger, Koch and Weinm¨uller
(2002).
The systematic study of collocation methods for initial-value problems in
ODEs, Volterra integral and integro-differential equations, and other types of
functional differential equations has its origin, respectively, in the late 1960s, the
early 1970s, and the early 1980s. For initial-value problems in ordinary (ﬁrst-
order) differential equations collocation by continuous piecewise polynomials
leads to a subclass of (continuous) implicit Runge–Kutta methods for which
results on optimal superconvergence and asymptotic stability properties were
well understood by the early 1980s (in fact, related superconvergence results
date back to work by Kuntzmann (1961), Butcher (1964), and – especially –
by Guillou and Soul´e (1969) and Wright (1970)). The subsequent extension
of the analysis of collocation methods to more general functional differential
and integral equations (Tavernini (1971, 1978), Bellen (1984), Buhmann and
Iserles (1991, 1992, 1993), Iserles (1994c, 1997b), Brunner (1997a)) quickly
revealed that many of the results obtained for ODEs do either not carry over to
many of these equations, or their proofs have presented (and are still presenting)
formidable challenges to numerical analysts (see Chapter 5).
The connection between collocation in S(0)
m (Ih) and certain classes of (high-
order) Runge–Kutta methods was ﬁrst observed by Guillou and Soul´e (1969)
and by Wright (1970). Compare also Nørsett and Wanner (1979) and the
relevant sections in, e.g. the monographs by Butcher (1987), Hairer, Nørsett and

Wanner (1993), Hairer and Wanner (1996); and see Lambert (1991), Iserles and
Nørsett (1991), and Iserles (1996).
Superconvergence results were also given by Axelsson (1969) (for the Radau
and Lobatto points) and Wouk (1976). Wanner (1976) uses the collocation
framework to obtain an elegant derivation of A-stability properties. Collocation
for ODEs with periodic solutions was studied by L.-Q. Zhang (1991, 1992) (see
also the references in these papers); see also Engelborghs, Luzyanina, in ’t Hout
and Roose (2000) and Engelborghs and Doedel (2002) on collocation for delay
DEs with periodic solutions.
Various properties of collocation matrices are described in Wright (1984),
Gerard and Wright (1984), Ahmed and Wright (1985); see also Russell and
Sun (1997) and D. Sloan (2003) (properties of pseudo-spectral differentiation
matrices).
Continuous (and natural extensions of) Runge–Kutta methods are analysed
in Zennaro (1985, 1986, 1988); see also Chapter 5 in Bellen and Zennaro
(2003). Collocation methods in more general settings (DEs on Lie groups)
are discussed in Zanna (1999) and in the illuminating survey by Iserles et al.
(2000); compare also the monograph by Hairer, Lubich and Wanner (2002). The
1996 monograph by Stuart and Humphries is the authoritative source for their
analysis in the framework of dynamical systems; see also Stuart and Peplow
(1991) on the dynamics of the θ-method.
The solvability of the system of nonlinear algebraic equations (1.1.7) or
(1.1.10) arising in implicit Runge–Kutta methods, and how the order is affected
by the iterative process, has been studied by many researchers: see, for exam-
ple, Liu and Kraaijevanger (1988) (and references), Spijker (1994), Jackson,
Kvaernø and Nørsett (1996), and Hairer and Wanner (1996), pp. 215–224.
A very comprehensive survey of superconvergence results (from ODEs and
PDES to IEs and IDEs) is given by Kˇr´ıˇzek and Neittaanm¨aki (1998); see also
their earlier paper of (1987) for an impression of the rapid development of this
area of numerical analysis.
1.2: Perturbed collocation methods
The question on how to ‘embed’ general Runge-Kutta methods in a collocation
framework led Nørsett (1980) and Nørsett and Wanner (1981) to introduce
perturbed collocation methods. Compare also Nørsett (1984).
1.3: Collocation in smoother piecewise polynomial spaces
Because of the considerable interest in cubic (and more general natural) spline
functions in the early 1960s it is not surprising that collocation spaces with
high regularity were used in most of the early papers on piecewise polynomial
collocation for ODEs, namely in Loscalzo and Talbot (1967), Loscalzo (1968,

stepping for parabolic PDEs.
Sch¨otzau and Schwab (2000, 2001) present the deﬁnitive analysis of hp-
versions of dG methods; see also the survey paper by Cockburn, Karniadakis
and Shu (2000) and its extensive list of references (including the history of the
subject).
1.7: Spectral and pseudospectral methods
The literature on spectral and pseudospectral methods has grown rapidly in the
last ten years. The reader will ﬁnd good introductions in, e.g. the books by
Mercier (1989), Funaro (1992), Fornberg (1996), Boyd (2000), and Trefethen
(2000); see also the surveys by Tadmore (1987) and the recent paper by D. Sloan
(2003) on properties of matrices ocurring in spectral differentiation.
A closely related class of methods are the sinc methods introduced by
Stenger; see his 1993 monograph and his survey papers of 1995 and 2000.
1.8: The Peano theorems for interpolation and quadrature
Giuseppe Peano’s paper appeared in 1913. Good introductions to (and examples
for) Peano’s remainder theory can be found in Stroud (1974), Davis (1975),
Powell (1981), and Davis and Rabinowitz (1984, pp. 285–295). Its use in the
analysis of linear multistep methods for ODEs is discussed in Hairer, Nørsett
and Wanner (1993, pp. 375–377).
A more general setting for Peano’s remainder theory is given in Sard (1963).
De Marchi and Vianello (1996, 1997) discuss abstract versions of the Peano
theorems for vector-valued functions and normed spaces. Fractional versions
of the Peano theorems are due to Diethelm (1997a, 1997b, 1999).

1969) (see also Schoenberg’s review paper of 1974) and in the 1970s in, e.g.
Hung (1970), Callender (1971), Micula (1972), and in the book by Micula
(1978, pp. 184–200). However, collocation spaces of high regularity tend to
lead to divergent approximations: this was ﬁrst observed by Loscalzo and Talbot
(1967), Loscalzo (1968), and Hung (1970). The comprehensive analysis of the
convergence/divergence properties of polynomial spline collocation solutions
for ODEs is due to M¨ulthei who, in a series of papers between 1979 and 1982
provided a complete divergence/convergence theory which also encompassed
collocation with multiple ci. Compare also the related paper by Werner and
Hilgers (1986) on nonlinear spline collocation. Related earlier results were
given by A. Pahnutov (1975) and by B.I. Kvasov (1973); compare also MR
80i:65085ab.
1.4: Higher-order ODEs
Spline collocation methods for initial-value problems in kth-order ODEs were
ﬁrst studied by Micula (1974) for k = 2; see also Micula (1978) and its refer-
ences.Theconvergenceandstabilitypropertiesareanalysedindetail(fork = 2)
in Kramarz (1978, 1980), van der Houwen, Sommeijer and Cong (1991), Cole-
man (1992), Coleman and Duxbury (2000), and Paternoster (2000). See also
Aguilar and Brunner (1988) and Brunner (1988a, 1988b) for local superconver-
gence results in kth-order VIDEs, from which analogous results for kth-order
ODEs follow.
1.5: Multistep collocation
ThepapersbyLie(1990)andLieandNørsett(1989)containacompleteanalysis
of multistep collocation methods, and in particular of their superconvergence
properties; see also Nguyen Cong and Mitsui (1996). The monograph by Hairer
and Wanner (1996, pp. 270–278) should be consulted for a concise review of
convergence results for multistep Runge–Kutta and collocation methods. In
his 1983 paper Dahlquist comments on the connection between one-leg and
(multistep) collocation methods.
1.6: The discontinuous Galerkin method for ODEs
The origins of dG methods for ODEs can be traced back to the early 1970s: see
Hulme (1972a, 1972b), Lesaint and Raviart (1974) (connection with implicit
Runge–Kutta methods), and Nørsett (1974). Results dealing with superconver-
gence properties are given in the fundamental papers by Delfour, Hager and
Trochu (1981) and Delfour and Dubeau (1986); see also Bensebah and Dubeau
(1997). The theory of a priori and, especially, a posteriori error estimates and
corresponding adaptive mesh selection is analysed in depth in Johnson (1988),
Estep (1995), in the surveys by Eriksson, Estep, Hansbo and Johnson (1995a,
1995b), and in the book by the same authors (1996). Compare also Thom´ee

Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
Piecewise polynomial collocation methods for Volterra integral equations of
the ﬁrst and second kind introduce a number of aspects not present when solv-
ing ODEs. The ﬁrst is that the collocation solution for a second-kind VIE
does no longer exhibit O(h2m) superconvergence at the mesh points if colloca-
tion is at the Gauss points: this optimal order is recovered only in the iterated
collocation solution. For VIEs of the ﬁrst kind, the collocation solution is con-
vergent only under certain ‘stability constraints’ on the collocation parameters,
and local superconvergence at the mesh points cannot occur. Secondly, the
collocation equations are in general not yet in a form amenable to numerical
computation, due to the presence of the memory term given by the Volterra in-
tegral operator. Thus, another discretisation step, based on appropriate quadra-
ture approximations, is necessary to obtain the fully discretised collocation
scheme.
In order to make the book largely self-contained we will begin this and each
of the subsequent chapters with a brief introduction to those aspects of the
theory of Volterra integral and more general Volterra functional equations that
will play a role in the analysis of the corresponding collocation solutions.

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
where the kernel K = K(t, s) is continuous on D := {(t, s) : 0 ≤s ≤t ≤T }.
The integral equation
y(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t),
t ∈I,
(2.1.2)
is a (linear) Volterra integral equation (VIE) of the second kind for the unknown
function y = y(t); g = g(t) is a given continuous function on I. It will be
assumed throughout the book that the given functions, and hence the solution,
are real-valued.
TheclassicaltheoryoflinearVIEsisduetoVitoVolterra(1896a):thestarting
point in his Nota I was the problem of ‘inverting the integral’
(Vy)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I,
g(0) = 0,
(2.1.3)
inC(I).UsingtheterminologysuggestedbyLalesco(1908,p.126),theproblem
consists in solving a Volterra integral equation of the ﬁrst kind. Volterra showed
that under certain conditions on its kernel K (see Section 2.1.4) the ﬁrst-kind
VIE (2.1.3) is equivalent to a second-kind equation to which Picard iteration
(introduced in Picard (1890)) can be applied. This iteration process leads, via
the Neumann series associated with the kernel K in (2.1.1), to the resolvent
kernel and hence to the ‘resolvent representation’ of the solution y.
To be more precise, let y0(t) := g(t) and deﬁne the inﬁnite sequence {yn(t)}
associated with (2.1.2) by
yn(t) := g(t) + (Vyn−1)(t),
t ∈I,
n ≥1.
(2.1.4)
A straightforward induction argument shows that the iterates yn(t) can be ex-
pressed in terms of the iterated kernels Kn = Kn(t, s) (n ≥1), namely,

The iterated kernels also satisfy a relationship more general than (2.1.6), as
the following result (ﬁrst established in Volterra (1896a) (Nota I, p. 316) shows.

Proof The above assertion is obviously true for r = 1, since K1 = K. Thus,
assuming it holds for n, a simple induction argument establishes the result
(2.1.7) for n + 1. The details are left as an exercise (Exercise 2.5.1).
Remark If we associate with a given iterated kernel Kn the Volterra operator
Vn : C(I) →C(I) deﬁned by
(Vnφ)(t) :=
 t

Kn(t, s)φ(s)ds,

then the result of Lemma 2.1.1 may be stated in a more general way, by saying
that the Volterra integral operators Vn commute:
Vr ◦Vn−r = Vn−r ◦Vr
1 ≤r < n (n ≥2).
Consider now (2.1.6): for K ∈C(D), with ¯K := max{|K(t, s)| : (t, s) ∈

is usually introduced by means of the above resolvent equations. We summarise
this in the following

corresponding to the given kernel K in the linear Volterra integral equation
(2.1.2) is (formally) deﬁned by either of the resolvent equations (2.1.9) and

Remark Good introductions to the resolvent theory (including the uniqueness
of the solution of the resolvent equations in C(D) and more general spaces like
L p(D)) may be found in Miller (1971a, Chapter IV) and Corduneanu (1991,
Section 4.2). The most general treatments are those in Gripenberg, Londen and
Staffans (1990) (see in particular Sections 2.3–2.5 and Chapter 6) and in Pr¨uss
(1993) where the abstract resolvent theory is presented in Chapters I.1, I.2, and
III.10. See also the papers by Grimmer (1982), Grimmer and Pritchard (1983),
and Grimmer and Pr¨uss (1985).
The existence and uniqueness of solutions to the linear Volterra integral
equations (2.1.2) is established in Theorem 2.1.2. This result is due to Volterra
and can be found in his Nota I of 1896.
Theorem 2.1.2 Let K ∈C(D),andlet R denotetheresolventkernelassociated
with K. Then for any g ∈C(I) the second-kind Volterra integral equation
(2.1.2) has a unique solution y ∈C(I), and this solution is given by
y(t) = g(t) +
 t

R(t, s)g(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(2.1.11)
Proof Replace t in the VIE (2.1.2) by v, then multiply the equation by R(t, v)
and integrate with respect to v over the interval [0, t]. Using Dirichlet’s formula
and the resolvent equation (2.1.10) we obtain

The resolvent representation (2.1.11) now follows by substituting the above
relation in (2.1.2). Thus, (2.1.11) deﬁnes a solution y ∈C(I) for (2.1.2). In
order to show that, under the assumptions of Theorem 2.1.2, this solution is

unique, assume that z ∈C(I) is also a solution. Since
z(v) = g(v) + (Vz)(v),
v ∈I,
multiplication of both sides by R(t, v) and integration with respect to v over

Here, we have again employed Dirichlet’s formula and the second resolvent
equation (2.1.10). By (2.1.11) the above equation thus reduces to
0 = [y(t) −g(t)] −
 t
0
K(t, s)z(s)ds = [y(t) −g(t)] −[z(t) −g(t)] = 0,
t ∈I.
The uniqueness of the solution y given by (2.1.11) can also be established
directly via the integral form of Gronwall’s Lemma (see Section 2.1.8). If y
and z are two (continuous) solutions of (2.1.2) it follows that
y(t) −z(t) = (V(y −z))(t),
t ∈I.
Hence, assuming again that |K(t, s)| ≤¯K in D,
|y(t) −z(t)| ≤¯K
 t

|y(s) −z(s)|ds,
t ∈I.
By Lemma 2.1.14 this yields
|y(t) −z(t)| ≤0 · exp( ¯Kt) = 0 for all t ∈I,
thus verifying that y(t) = z(t) for all t ∈I.
Remark In contrast to the linear Fredholm integral equation of the second
kind,
y(t) = g(t) + λ(F y)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
with
(F y)(t) :=

and g ∈C(I), K ∈C(I × I), the Volterra integral equation

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I) for any (real or complex) parameter λ.

(n ≥1);
hence, the inverse of the linear operator I −λV : C(I) →C(I) exists as a
bounded linear operator for any kernel K ∈C(D) and any complex number λ.
In other words, the spectrum of V, σ(V) (that is, the set of values λ for which the
operator I −λV is not invertible in C(I)) is empty. This is in general not true
for I −λF (see, e.g. Fredholm (1903), Pogorzelski (1966), Cochran (1972),
Gohberg and Goldberg (1980), or Kress (1999)).
Thus, the VIE y = g + λVy, possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I) for any
g ∈C(I) and any λ ∈IR (or in C).
The following regularity result is an immediate consequence of the deﬁnition
of the iterated kernels of K and the resolvent kernel R, since K ∈Cm(D)
implies Kn ∈Cm(D) for all n ≥2 and hence, by the uniform convergence of
the Neumann series, R ∈Cm(D).
Theorem 2.1.3 Assume that K ∈Cm(D). Then its resolvent R has the same
degree of regularity, namely R ∈Cm(D). Thus, for any g ∈Cm(I) the solution
of the Volterra integral equation (2.1.2) satisﬁes y ∈Cm(I).
It is often advantageous to represent the solution of the linear VIE (2.1.2) in
a form resembling the familiar variation-of-constant formula for a linear ﬁrst-
order ODE. To derive this alternative representation, we ﬁrst observe that the
special Volterra integral equation

(2.1.14)
the well-known representation of the solution of the initial-value problem
(2.1.13). On the other hand, we have seen that the resolvent kernel R associ-
ated with the kernel K(t, s) := a(s) in (2.1.12) satisﬁes the resolvent equation
(2.1.9),
R(t, s) = a(s) +

with R(s, s) = a(s),

This initial-value problem possesses the (unique) solution

(t, s) ∈D.
In other words, we have shown that for the special Volterra integral equation
(2.1.12),
∂U(t, s)
∂s
= −R(t, s),
(t, s) ∈D.
(2.1.17)
We will now prove that the variation-of-constants formula (2.1.14) can be
extended to the general linear Volterra integral equation (2.1.2). It can be found
in Bownds and Cushing (1973); compare also Brunner and van der Houwen
(1986, pp. 13–14).
Theorem 2.1.4 Assume that g ∈C1(I) and K ∈C(D). Then the (unique) so-
lution y ∈C(I) of the Volterra equation (2.1.2) may be expressed in the form
y(t) = U(t, 0)g(0) +

(t, s) ∈D.

Moreover, U(t, s) is related to the resolvent kernel R(t, s) of the given kernel
K(t, s) by
−∂U(t, s)
∂s
= R(t, s),
(t, s) ∈D.
(2.1.20)
Proof Consider ﬁrst the right-hand side of (2.1.18): since we have U(t, t) = 1
on I, integration by parts yields, for t ∈I,
U(t, 0)g(0) + {g(t) −U(t, 0)g(0) −

= g(t) −

Thus, (2.1.18) can be written as
y(t) = g(t) −
 t

∂U(t, s)
∂s
g(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(2.1.21)
Since y is the unique solution of (2.1.2), comparison of (2.1.11) and (2.1.20)
shows that the statement (2.1.20) in Theorem 2.1.4 is true. This can also be seen
by observing that the right-hand side of (2.1.19) is continuously differentiable
with respect to s:
∂U(t, s)

(t, s) ∈D.
Multiplying the above equation by (−1) reveals that the resulting equation
has the form of the resolvent equation (2.1.9): since that equation is uniquely
solvable on D, we must have (∂/∂s)U(t, s) = −R(t, s), (t, s) ∈D.
For certain classes of linear Volterra integral equations it is not necessary to
resort to Volterra’s classical approach to establish the existence and uniqueness
of continuous solutions. Here, we brieﬂy mention Volterra equations corre-
sponding to Volterra operators V with ﬁnite rank and described by degenerate
(or: ﬁnitely decomposable) kernels of the form

(2.1.22)
inherits the convolution structure of k(t −s): we have R(t, s) =: ρ(t −s). This
is readily seen from the Picard iteration process applied to (2.1.22): according
to (2.1.4) and (2.1.6) the iterated kernels corresponding to k(t −s) are given by
kn(t −s) =

(2.1.25)
Here, the resolvent kernel ρ is deﬁned by the resolvent equation (2.1.23) or
(2.1.24).
The following result is often useful in applications (we shall return to a
slightly more general version in Section 6.1.2) because it establishes a connec-
tion between the solution of the general convolution equation (2.1.22) and one
with a particular (constant) forcing function g (Bellman and Cooke (1963)).

Assume that g ∈C1(I), and k ∈C(I). Then the (unique) solutions y ∈C(I)
and w ∈C(I) of (2.1.26) and (2.1.27) are related by

If the solution w is in C1(I) then we also have

Proof Exercise 2.5.5.
An alternative approach to solving linear Volterra integral equations possess-
ing convolution kernels is by means of Laplace transform techniques. We shall
not pursue this here; the interested reader is referred to the classical monograph
by Doetsch (1974); see also Guy and Sal`es (1991, pp. 23–32) for a detailed
description and numerous examples.
2.1.3 Systems of linear VIEs
Systems (of usually very large dimension) arise naturally in the spatial semidis-
cretisation of partial Volterra integral equations. A typical example is given by

which occurs as a mathematical model in linear quasi-static visco-elasticity
problems(see,e.g.Shaw,WarbyandWhiteman(1997)andShawandWhiteman
(2001), and their lists of references). Here,  ⊂IRd is open and bounded, with
(piecewise) smooth boundary ∂. Spatial approximation of the differential
operator based on ﬁnite element (or, for simple geometries, ﬁnite difference)
techniques leads to a system of VIEs of the form
y(t) = g(t) +
 t
0
K(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I,
(2.1.29)
where
y(t) := ( y1(t), . . . , yM(t) )T ∈IRM,
g(t) := ( g1(t), . . . , gM(t) )T ∈
IRM and
K(t, s) :=

Ki, j(t, s)
(i, j = 1, . . . , M)

∈L(IRM)
with g and K continuous on I and D, respectively. The theory on the exis-
tence and uniqueness of a continuous solutions y follows in a straightforward
way from the theory developed in Section 2.1.1 (and was already established
by Volterra (1896c)). In particular, the resolvent kernel R = R(t, s) ∈L(IRm)
satisﬁes the resolvent equations
R(t, s) = K(t, s) +
 t
s
K(t, v)R(v, s)ds,

s
R(t, v)K(v, s)ds,
(t, s) ∈D.
(cf. (2.1.9), (2.1.10)).
The following theorems on the existence and uniqueness, and the regularity
of solution are thus readily proved: the iterated kernel matrices Kn(t, s) are
deﬁned similar to (2.1.6), and the uniform upper bounds for their norms
||Kn(t, s)||∞(n ≥1) on D are obtained in complete analogy to the scalar case,
leading again to absolute and uniform convergence of the Neumann series (cf.
(2.1.8)),
R(t, s) :=
∞

n=1
Kn(t, s),
(t, s) ∈D,
and hence to the fact that R inherits the regularity of K.

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
Theorem 2.1.7 Assume that K ∈C(D), and let R denote its resolvent kernel.
Then for every g ∈C(I) the system of second-kind Volterra integral equations

y(t) = g(t) +

R(t, s)g(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(2.1.30)
If g ∈Cm(I) and K ∈Cm(D) (m ≥1), then the solution y of the linear system
(2.1.29) lies in Cm(I).
We shall return to these results in Chapter 3 (Section 3.1.2) when discussing
neutral Volterra integro-differential equations of the form

It will be seen that such an equation can be rewritten as a system of k + 1 second-
kind VIEs with a (sparse) kernel matrix K ∈L(IRk+1). This observation, and
the result of Theorem 2.1.7, will then play a key role in the derivation of opti-
mal superconvergence estimates for collocation solutions uh ∈S(d)

2.1.4 Linear VIEs of the ﬁrst kind
The general theory of integral equations with variable upper limit of integration
was estabilshed by Volterra (1896a, Nota I). As we mentioned in Section 2.1.1
he studied the solvability of the ﬁrst-kind integral equation
(Vy)(t) :=

K(t, s)y(s)ds = g(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
with
g(0) = 0,

result.
Theorem 2.1.8 Assume that K satisﬁes K ∈C(D), ∂K/∂t ∈C(D), and
|K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 for t ∈I. Then for any g ∈C1(I) with g(0) = 0 the integral
equation (2.1.31) has a unique solution y ∈C(I).
Proof Clearly, the condition that g(0) = 0 is necessary for y to be continuous
at t = 0. The assumptions for K and g permit the differentiation of both sides
of (2.1.31), yielding

deﬁned by
g1(t) := g′(t)/K(t, t) and
K1(t, s) := −(∂K(t, s)/∂t)/K(t, t).
The proof is now completed by appealing to Theorem 2.1.2.
Remark InSection6.1.6(Theorem6.1.16withα = 0)wewillseeanextension
of this classical result to nonlinear ﬁrst-kind VIEs of Hammerstein type,
 t

K(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds = g(t),

Under appropriate regularity assumptions this problem is equivalent to an im-
plicit VIE of the second-kind,

 t
0
K1(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds,
where g1 and K1 have the same meaning as in the proof of Theorem 2.1.8.
Example 2.1.1 The assumption that K(t, t) be non-zero for t ∈I is of course
not necessary for (2.1.31) to possess a unique continuous solution in I. As an
example, consider the kernel
K(t, s) = (t −s)r−1
(r −1)! ,
r ≥1 (r ∈IN),
which vanishes identically along the line t = s. However, equation (2.1.31)
with this kernel and with
g ∈Cr(I),
g( j)(0) = 0 ( j = 0, . . . ,r −1),
possesses the unique continuous solution y(t) = g(r)(t), t ∈I. This can be
readily veriﬁed either by direct substitution or by differentiating both sides of
the integral equation r times.
Example 2.1.2 Isolated zeros of K(t, s) in I can lead to non-uniqueness, as
the following example shows. Let
K(t, s) = 2t −3s,
g(t) = t2
(t ∈I = [0, T ]).
Here, K(0, 0) = 0 and K(t, t) < 0 whenever t > 0. It is easily veriﬁed that
y(t) = 1 + γ t is a (real) continuous solution for any γ ∈IR.

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
A detailed discussion of the connection between ﬁrst-kind VIEs with kernels
having K(0, 0) = 0 (and K(t, t) ̸= 0 when t > 0) and differential equations of
Fuchsian type may also be found in the 1927 survey paper by Davis. The ﬁrst
study of such VIEs is due to Volterra (1896b).
The equivalence between (2.1.31) and (2.1.32) allows us also to derive the
following regularity result.
Theorem 2.1.9 Let m ≥0 and assume that
(a) g ∈Cm+1(I), with g(0) = 0, and
(b) K ∈Cm+1(D),
with
|K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 for all t ∈I.
Then the unique solution of the ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equation (2.1.31)
lies in the space Cm(I).

Can the solution of a linear ﬁrst-kind VIE be represented in terms of a
‘resolvent kernel’, in analogy to linear VIEs of the second kind? As we shall

Here, the resolvent kernel R(· ; α) has the form
R(t −s; α) := γα(t −s)α−1,
0 ≤s < t ≤T,
with γα := sin(απ)/π(= 1/[(α)(1 −α)]). This is reminiscent of the result
in Corollary 6.1.4.
Does an analogous resolvent representation for the solution of the ﬁrst-kind
VIE (2.1.31) exists if the kernel K is smooth on D? This problem was studied in
detail by Gripenberg 1980 (see also the monograph by Gripenberg, Londen and
Staffans (1990, pp. 156–167)). He showed that in this case no such function
in the classical sense exists: in order for an analogue of (2.1.34) to be true,
the resolvent kernel R has to be a measure. However, as can be seen in the
monograph just mentioned, the general resolvent theory for linear ﬁrst-kind
VIEs is far from being completely understood.

Volterra integral equations. A detailed treatment, including feasible numerical
(e.g. collocation based) methods for such problems, is beyond the scope of this
book. The interested reader may wish to consult the excellent survey paper by
Lamm (2000) and, in particular, the sections and references to sequential (i.e.
‘Volterra type’) regularisation methods studied by her and her collaborators.
Compare also Ring and Prix (2000) and Ring (2001) for a complementary
analysis.
As we have seen earlier, the solution of the (linear) ﬁrst-kind VIE (2.1.31)
does not depend continuously on the given data K and g. If g ∈C1(I), with
g(0) = 0, and K ∈C1(D), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 on I, then the equation can
be transformed into an equivalent second-kind equation with solution y ∈C(I).
However, for a small change from g(t) to gε(t) := g(t) + εg1(t) (ε ̸= 0), with
g1 ∈C1(I), g1(0) ̸= 0, this is no longer possible, and the solution yε is no
longer continuous on I. The following deﬁnition describes a measure of the
degree of ill-posedness (see Lamm (2000)).
Deﬁnition 2.1.2 The Volterra integral operator V given by (2.1.31) is said to
be ν-smoothing if there exists an integer ν ≥1 for which the kernel K of V
satisﬁes

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
If ∂j K(t, s)
∂t j
				
s=t
= 0 for t ∈I and all j ∈IN0, then V is called an inﬁnitely
smoothing Volterra operator.
TheVolterraequationVy = g isaν-smoothingproblemifV isaν-smoothing
operator and g ∈Cν(I).
Example 2.1.3 If K(t, s) ≡1 on D, then
(Vy)(t) =
 t
0
y(s)ds,
t ∈I,
is a one-smoothing operator. The corresponding ﬁrst-kind VIE describes the
process of differentiating the function g: y(t) = g′(t), t ∈I.
Example 2.1.4 Let r ∈IN. Then the Volterra operator given by
(Vy)(t) :
 t
0
(t −s)r−1
(r −1)! y(s)ds,
t ∈I,
is r-smoothing. We have seen in Example 2.1.1 that the solution of Vy = g is
y(t) = g(r)(t), t ∈I, provided we have g( j)(0) = 0, j = 0, . . . ,r −1.
Remark The degree of ill-posedness – which increases as ν increases – can
also be characterised by the singular values {σ j} of V (see, e.g. Lamm (2000,
p. 75) for references). These singular values behave like O(1/jν) as j →∞.
Example 2.1.5 The inverse heat conduction problem (often referred to as the
sideways heat equation; cf. Eld´en (1983) or the references in Lamm (2000,
pp. 76–77)) can be formulated as a ﬁrst-kind VIE whose kernel is
K(t, s) = k(t −s) =
1
2√π t−3/2 exp(−1/(4t)).
It is easily seen that the corresponding V has ν = ∞: it is an inﬁnitely smoothing
Volterra operator. This is of course consistent with the fact that solving the
sideways heat equation is a severely ill-posed problem.

If the functions deﬁning the kernel are continuous then we may formally trans-
form (2.1.35) into a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for
zi(t) :=
 t

bi(s, y(s))ds
(i = 1, . . . ,r).
This system of ODEs has the form

r

i=1
Ai(t)zi(t)) t ∈I
(i = 1, . . . ,r),
with initial conditions zi(0) = 0. We may thus appeal to the theory of nonlinear
ODEs to establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution z ∈C1(I), with
z := ( z1, . . . , zr )T . The unique solution y ∈C(I) of (2.1.35) is then given by

t ∈I
(n ≥0),
(2.1.37)
with y0(t) := g(t). The following (local) existence theorem (see, e.g. Miller
(1971a)) generalises the classical result for

result we will adopt the notation
D := {(t, s) : 0 ≤s ≤t ≤T },
B := {(t, s, y) : (t, s) ∈D, y ∈IR and |y −g(t)| ≤B},
and we set MB := max{|k(t, s, y)| : (t, s, y) ∈B}.
Theorem 2.1.10 Assume:
(a) g ∈C(I);
(b) k ∈C(B);
(c) K satisﬁes the Lipschitz condition

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
Then:
(i) The Picard iterates yn(t) exist for all n ≥1. They are continuous on the
interval I0 := [0, δ0], where
δ0 := min{T, B/MB},
and they converge uniformly on I0 to a solution y ∈C(I0) of the nonlinear
Volterra integral equation (2.1.36).
(ii) This solution y is the unique continuous solution on I0.
Proof
• Uniqueness: Suppose that (2.1.36) possesses two continuous solutions y1
and y2 on the interval I0. Hence, by (c),
|y1(t) −y2(t)| ≤
 t
0
|k(t, s, y1(s)) −k(t, s, y2(s)|ds
≤L B ·
 t
0
|y1(s) −y2(s)|ds,
t ∈I0.
It follows from the continuity of |y1 −y2| and from Lemma 2.1.14 (Section
2.1.8) that
|y1(t) −y2(t)| ≤0 · exp(L Bt) = 0,
t ∈I0.
Hence, ||y1 −y2||0,∞:= maxt∈I0 |y1(t) −y2(t)| = 0, implying that the two so-
lutions are identical on I0.
• Existence: We begin by showing that the Picard iterates deﬁned in (2.1.37)
satisfy
|yn(t) −g(t)| ≤MBt ≤B
for all t ∈I0.
Since this assertion is certainly true for n = 0, assume it holds for n. This
implies that (t, s, yn(s)) ∈B when t ∈I0. Hence, k(t, s, yn(s)) is well deﬁned
and we have
|k(t, s, yn(s))| ≤MB
for (t, s) ∈D.
This yields
|yn+1(t) −g(t)| ≤
 t
0
|k(t, s, yn(s))|ds ≤MBt ≤B,
t ∈I0.
Thus, yn+1(t) is deﬁned on I0, and it follows from the continuity of g and k on
I and B that yn+1 ∈C(I0).
We now prove that the sequence {yn(t)} deﬁned by Picard iteration (2.1.37)
is a Cauchy sequence on I0. To this end, let zn(t) := yn+1(t) −yn(t). It is readily

|zn(t)| ≤MB Ln

(n ≥0).
Therefore,
yn+m(t) −yn(t) =

Thus, limn→∞yn(t) =: y(t) uniformly on I0, with limit y ∈C(I0). Using the

 t

as n →∞. This allows us to carry out the ﬁnal step in the existence proof,
namely to show that y solves the nonlinear integral equation (2.1.36) in I0:
y(t) = lim
n→∞yn(t) = g(t) + lim
n→∞

 t

k(t, s, lim
n→∞yn−1(s))ds = g(t) + (Vy)(t),
t ∈I0.
The proof is now complete.
Does the solution exist (and remain continuous) beyond t = δ0? Setting
z(t) := y(t + δ0)thegivenVIE(2.1.36)canbewrittenin‘shifted’form,namely,
z(t) = g0(t) +

where

k(t + δ0, s, y(s))ds
and
k0(t, s, z) := k(t + δ0, s + δ0, z),
t + δ0 ≤T.
Since g0 and k0 satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1.10, we may deduce the
existence of a (unique) continuous solution z on some interval [0, δ1], with
δ1 > 0, and this implies that the solution y of the orginal VIE (2.1.36) has
been continued continuously to [δ0, δ1]. How far this process can be continued

obviously depends on the constants B and MB. A more detailed analysis of the
question regarding the continuation of solutions to nonlinear VIEs can be found
in, e.g. the books by Miller (1971a, pp. 30–33) or Burton (1983, pp. 66–89).
We conclude this discussion with an example showing that a solution cannot
always be continued to an arbitrary interval.
Example 2.1.6 VIEs with blow-up solutions
It is well known that solutions of the initial-value problem
y′(t) = λy(t) + ϵ(y(t))p,
t ≥0 (λ ≤0, ϵ > 0, p > 1)
y(0) = y0 > 0,
may not exist for all t > 0; in other words, the solution cannot always be
continuedtoanyﬁniteinterval.Thisinitial-valueproblemisofcourseequivalent
to the nonlinear VIE
y(t) = y0 +

{λy(s) + ϵ(y(s))p}ds,
t ≥0,
(2.1.38)
which may be viewed as a particular case of the ‘semilinear’ VIE (2.1.40)
considered below. The following result shows that the solution may blow up
in ﬁnite time: there exists Tb < ∞so that limt→T −
b y(t) = +∞. Since the VIE
(2.1.38) corresponds to a Bernoulli differential equation, the proof of Theorem
2.1.11 is elementary.
Theorem 2.1.11 Assume that λ < 0, ϵ > 0, p > 1 and y0 > 0. Then the
(unique) continuous solution of (2.1.38) is (formally) described by
y(t) =

y1−p

exp(−λ(p −1)t) −(ϵ/λ)(1 −exp(−λ(p −1)t)

.
(2.1.39)
For given λ and p it blows up in ﬁnite time Tb if, and only if, the initial value
y0 is such that
y0 > (−λ/ϵ)1/(p−1).
The blow-up time is then

are discussed in Miller (1971a, pp. 46–51). Related blow-up results can be
found in, e.g. Okrasi´nski (1991), Mydlarczyk (1994, 1996, 1999), Bushell and
Okrasi´nski (1996), Olmstead (2000); see also the survey paper by Roberts
(1998) and its list of references.
In Chapter 6 (Exercise 6.6.24) we shall encounter an analogous result for
a more general nonlinear VIE with weakly singular kernel that arises in, e.g.
combustion theory.
As we have seen above, in applications nonlinear VIEs often occur in ‘per-
turbed’ (or: ‘semi-linear’) form,
y(t) = g(t) +
 t
0
K(t, s){y(s) + H(s, y(s))}ds,
=: g(t) + (Vy)(t) + (Hy)(t),

(2.1.40)
where V is our usual linear Volterra integral operator (2.1.1) corresponding to
the kernel K and where H denotes the Volterra–Hammerstein integral operator
deﬁned by
(Hy)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)H(s, y(s))ds;
here, K ∈C(D) and H is a (‘small’) smooth function. If (2.1.40) possesses
a unique solution y ∈C(I), this equation may be rewritten in the form of a
nonlinear variation-of-constant representation in which the integral term cor-
responding to H is viewed as a perturbation of the linear VIE described by V.
This is made precise in the following theorem (Grossman and Miller (1970,
1973)).
Theorem 2.1.12 Suppose that the nonlinear integral equation (2.1.40) has a
unique solution y ∈C(I), and let H : I × IR →IR be (Lipschitz) continuous.
Then the solution of this equation may be written as

of R and K.
The nonlinear second-kind Volterra integral equation (2.1.40) is a particular
case of a more general Volterra–Hammerstein integral equation often encoun-
tered in applications (see, e.g. Brunner (1991) and its references).

(2.1.42)
is called a Volterra–Hammerstein operator. Here, G : I × IR →IR is smooth,
while the kernel function K = K(t, s) may be continuous (bounded) or weakly
singular (the latter case will be considered in Section 6.1.4). The corresponding
second-kind Volterra integral equation,
y(t) = g(t) + (Hy)(t),
t ∈I,
(2.1.43)
is a Volterra–Hammerstein integral equation of the second kind.

2.1 Review of basic Volterra theory (I)
75
Note that in the above equation (2.1.40) the nonlinearity G is given by
G(s, y) = y + H(s, y).
Remark In his 1930 paper A. Hammerstein analysed the solvability of the
nonlinear Fredholm-type integral equation
y(t) = g(t) +
 T
0
K(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds,
t ∈I.
Therefore such equations now carry the name of Hammerstein. Hammerstein’s
analysis was continued by Niemytzki (1934); see also the books by Tricomi
(1957), Krasnosel’skii and Zabreiko (1984), and Corduneanu (1991, pp. 86–88)
for the theory of Hammerstein equations of Fredholm or Volterra type.
In Section 2.3.3 we shall see that it will frequently be advantageous to
rewrite a nonlinear second-kind Volterra integral equation of Hammerstein form
(2.1.43) as follows. Deﬁne the Niemytzki operator (or: substitution operator)
N by
(Nφ)(t) := G(t, φ(t)),
t ∈I,
and set z(t) := (N y)(t). The original Volterra–Hammerstein equation (2.1.43)
then becomes
y(t) = g(t) + (VN y)(t),
t ∈I,
(2.1.44)
and can thus be written as an implicitly linear integral equation for z,
z(t) = G(t, g(t) + (Vz)(t)),
t ∈I,
(2.1.45)
where V denotes the linear Volterra integral operator with kernel K(t, s),
(Vz)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)z(s)ds,
t ∈I.
If (2.1.45) has a unique solution z ∈C(I) then the (unique) solution y ∈C(I)
of the original Volterra–Hammerstein equation is obtained by
y(t) = g(t) + (Vz)(t),
t ∈I.
(2.1.46)
It is shown in Krasnosel’skii and Zabreiko (1984, p. 143) that, under suit-
able assumptions on the (smooth) nonlinearity G, there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between (continuous) solutions of (2.1.43) and (2.1.45); hence, if
(2.1.43) possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I) then (2.1.45) has a unique so-
lution z ∈C(I). Compare also Corduneanu (1991, p. 153). General results on
the existence of solutions to Hammerstein integral equations can also be found
in Dolph and Minty (1964) and in Brezis and Browder (1975).

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
2.1.6 Volterra–Fredholm integral equations
One of the most prominent sources of Volterra–Fredholm integral equations of
the second kind is mathematical population dynamics (see, e.g. Thieme (1977,
1979), Diekmann (1978)). Typically, such a VFIE has the form
u(t, x) = g(t, x) + (T u)(t, x),

Here,  denotes a (closed) bounded region in IRd (d = 1, 2, 3) with (piecewise)
smooth boundary ∂. In applications one often has
K(t, s, x, ξ) = k(t −s)H(x, ξ),
where k represents a (positive) memory kernel.
In this section we brieﬂy show, by means of (2.1.47) corresponding to the
linearVolterra–Fredholmoperator(2.1.48)with G(u) = u,thattheVolterrapart
of the integral operator ‘dominates’ the FIE, in the sense that the Neumann series
generated by the Picard iteration process converges absolutely and uniformly on
I ×  (in other words, the spectrum of T consists only of {0}). The following
result, as well as detailed proofs, can be found in Kauthen (1989a, 1989b); see
also Pachpatte (1986), and Brunner (1990) for the nonlinear case.

sharp contrast to Picard iteration for Fredholm integral equations where the
majorant series for the Neumann series is a geometric series.) We leave the
details of the proof as a simple exercise.

(2.1.51)
Here, x(θ) is a smooth 1-periodic parametric representation of the boundary
curve  := ∂, and g represents the function describing the given boundary
condition on I × ∂. Since the kernel in (2.1.51) possesses a weak singular-
ity at t = s a more detailed discussion of this ﬁrst-kind VFIE belongs more
appropriately in Chapter 6.
Details can be found, e.g. in the papers by Iso and Onishi (1991) and Hamina
and Saranen (1994), and in the doctoral dissertation by H¨am¨al¨ainen (1998). The
book by Atkinson (1997a) contains a good introduction to the basic theory and
the numerical treatment of boundary integral equations.

(2.1.52)
with g ∈C() and K ∈C(D2), where we have set
D2 := {(x, ξ, y, η) : 0 ≤ξ ≤x ≤X, 0 ≤η ≤y ≤Y}.
The existence and uniqueness of continuous solutions was discussed by Vol-
terra (1986c), Lalesco (1912), Volterra (1913); see also Kowalewski (1930,
pp. 83–90). Picard iteration is again the principal tool in the proof of the fol-
lowing result, the analogue of Theorem 2.1.2.
Theorem 2.1.14 Assume that K ∈C(D2). Then for any g ∈C() the integral
equation (2.1.52) possesses a unqique solution u ∈C(). This solution has the

kernel K; it inherits the regularity of K.

two-dimensional ﬁrst-kind integral equation

K(x, ξ, y, η)u(ξ, η)dη dξ = g(x, y),

(partial) derivatives on their respective domains  and D2, with g(0, y) =
0 (y ∈[0, Y]), g(x, 0) = 0 (x ∈[0, X]), and |K(x, x, y, y)| ≥k0 > 0 for x ∈
[0, X], y ∈[0, Y]. He showed that under these hypotheses the above ‘multiple
integral’ can be ‘inverted’ and the (unique) solution u ∈C() is given by the

with obvious meaning of the kernels H1,0, H0,1 and H1,1. This equation is
obtainedbydifferentiating(2.1.53)withrespectto x,followedbydifferentiation
with respect to y.
Second-kind VIEs of the form (2.1.53) also arise in the analysis of a special
second-order hyperbolic initial-value problem, known as the Goursat problem:

(x, y) ∈,
with u(0, y) = α(y), u(x, 0) = β(x) on [0, Y] and [0, X], respectively. Details
can be found in, e.g. Goursat (1942), Moore (1961), and Dzyadyk (1995); see
also McKee, Tang and Diogo (2000) and the Notes at the end of this chapter
for additional references.
2.1.8 Comparison theorems
We begin with a slight generalisation of the classical result by Gronwall (1919).
Its proof can be found for example in Quarteroni and Valli (1997, pp. 13–14).
Lemma 2.1.15 Let I := [0, T ] and assume that z, g ∈C(I), k ∈C(I), with
k(t) ≥0. If z satisﬁes the inequality
z(t) ≤g(t) +
 t
0
k(s)z(s)ds,
t ∈I,
(2.1.55)
then
z(t) ≤g(t) +
 t
0
k(s)g(s) · exp
 t
s
k(v)dv

ds
for all t ∈I.
(2.1.56)
If g is non-decreasing on I the above inequality reduces to
z(t) ≤g(t) · exp
 t
0
k(s)ds

for all t ∈I.
(2.1.57)
Remark Gronwall’s original result is obtained by setting k(s) = k0 > 0 and
g(t) = at with a ≥0. We note also that the continuous function k = k(s) can be
replaced by an unbounded, but integrable, function, for example by k(t −s) =
(t −s)−α with 0 < α < 1. We shall return to this generalisation in Section 6.1.8
(Theorem 6.1.17).
We now turn to some representative comparison theorems for solutions of
Volterra inequalities. Good treatments of such results are given in the papers
by Beesack (1969, 1985a) and in Miller (1971a).

80
2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
Theorem 2.1.16 Assume that g ∈C(I) and K ∈C(D), with g(t) ≥0 and
K(t, s) ≥0 on I and D, respectively. Let R = R(t, s) be the resolvent ker-
nel corresponding to K = K(t, s). If z ∈C(I) satisﬁes the Volterra inequality
z(t) ≤g(t) +
 t
0
K(t, s)z(s)ds,
t ∈I,
then
z(t) ≤g(t) +
 t
0
R(t, s)g(s)ds,
t ∈I,
and R(t, s) ≥K(t, s) ≥0 for all (t, s) ∈D.
This result is readily proved, by observing that the non-negativity of K
is inherited by its iterated kernels Kn (cf. (2.1.7)) and hence, by the uniform
convergence of the Neumann series, by the resolvent kernel R. This also implies
that
R(t, s) =
∞

n=1
Kn(t, s) ≥K1(t, s) = K(t, s) ≥0,
(t, s) ∈D.
A more general comparison result is presented in Theorem 2.1.17. Its proof,
as well as variants of this result (including extension to VIEs in the L2 setting),
can be found in Beesack (1969, 1975); see also Pachpatte (1998). The books
by Miller (1971a) and Cochran (1972) contain nonlinear analogues of Theorem
2.1.16.
Theorem 2.1.17 Assume:
(a) The functions gi ∈C(I) (i = 1, 2) satisfy |g1(t)| ≤g2(t) on I.
(b) An analogous inequality holds for the kernels Ki ∈C(D):
|K1(t, s)| ≤K2(t, s),
(t, s) ∈D.
Then the (unique) solutions of the two integral equations
yi(t) = gi(t) +
 t
0
Ki(t, s)yi(s)ds,
t ∈I
(i = 1, 2),
are related by
|y1(t)| ≤y2(t) + |g1(t)| −g2(t),
t ∈I.
If g1 and K1 are non-negative on I and D, respectively, the absolute value signs
in the above inequality can be dropped.
Additional, and more general, comparison theorems can also be found in
Section 9.8 of the monograph by Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990).

2.2 Collocation for linear second-kind VIEs
2.2.1 Meshes and piecewise polynomial spaces
Let
Ih := {tn = t(N)
n
: 0 = t(N)
0
< t(N)
1
< . . . < t(N)
N
= T }
denote a mesh (or: grid) on the given interval I := [0, T ] and set, as in Section
1.1.1,
σ (N)
n
:= (t(N)
n
, t(N)
n+1,
h(N)

n+1 −t(N)
n
,
h(N) := max
(n) h(N)
n ,
h(N)
min := min
(n) h(N)
n .
Four types of meshes (or, more precisely, mesh sequences) will be used in this
and the following chapters:

2.2 Collocation for linear second-kind VIEs
83
r Uniform mesh Ih:
h(N)
n
= h(N)
min = h(N) = T/N
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N).
r Quasi-uniform mesh Ih:
h(N)
n /h(N)
min ≤h(N)/h(N)
min ≤γ
for all N ∈IN.
This implies that
Nh(N)
n
≤Nh(N) ≤γ Nh(N)
min ≤γ T
for all N ∈IN.
(2.2.1)
We shall encounter quasi-uniform meshes in Section 2.4.2 when analysing
the convergence of collocation solutions for ﬁrst-kind VIEs.
r Graded mesh Ih:
t(N)
n
:= (n/N)rT
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N),
r > 1.
(2.2.2)
The real number r is called the grading exponent (or: scaling parameter).
For r = 1 such a mesh reduces of course to a uniform one.
Observe that for r > 1 a graded mesh is not quasi-uniform, because we have
h(N)
h(N)
min
= h(N)
N−1
h(N)
0
= r N −1(1 −θ/N)r−1
N −r
= r Nr−1(1 −θ/N)r−1,
with 0 < θ < 1. Hence, h(N)/h(N)
min →∞as N →∞, whenever r > 1, but
limN→∞h(N) = 0.
Graded meshes will play an important role in Chapters 6 and 7, in the analysis
of the attainable order of collocation solutions for Volterra equations with
weakly singular kernels.
r Geometric mesh Ih:
t(N)
n
:= γ N−nT
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N),
with 0 < γ < 1.
The mesh parameter γ will depend on N, m, such that h(N) = h(N)
N−1 =
(1 −γ )T →0, as N →∞.
These meshes will be used in Chapter 5 when analysing optimal local su-
perconvergence of collocation solutions for functional equations with (van-
ishing) proportional delays.
For ease of notation we will, as in Chapter 1, usually suppress the superscript
N in t(N)
n
, h(N)
n
(etc.), except possibly in convergence analyses where we shall
be dealing with sequences of meshes corresponding to N →∞and h(N) →0.

84
2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
Deﬁnition 2.2.1 For a given mesh Ih the piecewise polynomial space S(d)
µ (Ih),
with µ ≥0, −1 ≤d < µ, is given by
S(d)
µ (Ih) := {v ∈Cd(I) : v|σn ∈πµ (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}.
Here, πµ denotes the space of (real) polynomials of degree not exceeding µ.
It is readily veriﬁed that S(d)
µ (Ih) is a (real) linear vector space whose dimension
is given by
dim S(d)
µ (Ih) = N(µ −d) + d + 1.
Remark The particular piecewise polynomial space S(d)
m+d(Ih) corresponding
to µ = m + d with m ≥1 and d ≥−1 will play a central role in this book.
Since its dimension is
dim S(d)
m+d(Ih) = Nm + (d + 1),
(2.2.3)
it may be viewed as the ‘natural’ collocation space for the approximation of
solutionstoinitial-valueproblemsforODEsorVolterraequations:aswealready
indicated in Chapter 1, the choice of the degree of regularity d will be governed
by the number of prescribed initial conditions, while the term Nm suggests that
m (distinct) collocation points are to be placed in each of the N subintervals
σn. Thus, the ‘natural’ choice of d in (2.2.3) is as follows:
r For Volterra integral equations (no initial condition) we choose d = −1;
hence, the natural collocation space will be S(−1)
m−1(Ih). Its dimension
is Nm.
r For ﬁrst-order ODEs or Volterra integro-differential equations (one initial
condition) we use d = 0, and the preferred collocation space is S(0)
m (Ih), with
dimension equal to Nm + 1.
r For ODEs or VIDEs of order k with k ≥2 (k initial conditions) the natural
collocation space is S(k−1)
m+k−1(Ih), corresponding to the choice d = k −1. The
dimension of this space is Nm + k.
Remark In the computational use of piecewise collocation methods in
S(d)
m+d(Ih), the value of m will usually not exceed m = 4. Hence, the obvious
candidate for the local representation of the collocation solution on σn will
be the local Lagrange basis corresponding to the m (distinct) collocation
parameters {ci}.

2.2 Collocation for linear second-kind VIEs
85
2.2.2 Piecewise polynomial collocation methods in S(−1)
m−1(Ih)
As in Section 2.1.1 let the linear Volterra integral operator V : C(I) →C(I)
be given by
(Vφ)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)φ(s)ds,
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(2.2.4)
where K ∈C(D) (D := {(t, s) : 0 ≤s ≤t ≤T }), and let g ∈C(I) be a given
function. The solution of the Volterra integral equation
y(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t),
t ∈I,
(2.2.5)
will be approximated by collocation in the piecewise polynomial space
S(−1)
m−1(Ih) := {v : v|σn ∈πm−1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)},
corresponding to the choice µ = m −1, d = −1 in Deﬁnition 2.2.1 and pos-
sessing the dimension dim S(−1)
m−1(Ih) = Nm. This collocation solution uh is
deﬁned by the collocation equation for (2.2.5),
uh(t) = g(t) + (Vuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(2.2.6)
where (see (1.1.3)) the set of collocation points,
Xh := {tn + cihn : 0 ≤c1 ≤. . . ≤cm ≤1 (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1)}, (2.2.7)
is determined by the given mesh Ih and the given collocation parameters {ci} ⊂
[0, 1]. Note that for m ≥2 the choice c1 = 0 and cm = 1 implies
uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) ∩C(I) = S(0)
m−1(Ih),
with dim S(0)
m−1(Ih) = N(m −1) + 1. This means that uh assumes the initial
value uh(t0,1) = uh(0) = g(0).
The iterated collocation solution uit
h corresponding to the collocation solu-
tion uh is deﬁned by
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Vuh)(t),
t ∈I.
(2.2.8)
It trivially satisﬁes
uit
h (t) = uh(t) for all t ∈Xh.
It will be seen below (Theorem 2.2.5 and, especially, Theorem 2.2.6) that uit
h
will often exhibit a higher order of convergence (‘superconvergence’) than uh
itself, for example if the collocation parameters {ci} are given by the Gauss
points: globally (on I) a gain of one order is obtained, while locally (at the
mesh points) the order is twice the global order of uh. We observe also that for
continuous data we have uit
h ∈C(I), in contrast to uh.

86
2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
As we mentioned at the end of Section 2.1.1, a convenient computational
form of the collocation equation (2.2.6) is obtained when employing local
Lagrange basis functions: setting
L j(v) :=
m

k̸= j
v −ck
c j −ck
(v ∈[0, 1]) and
Un, j := uh(tn + c jhn) ( j = 1, . . . , m),

Theorem 2.2.1 Assume that g and K in the Volterra integral equation (2.2.5)
are continuous on their respective domains I and D. Then there exists an
¯h > 0 so that for any mesh Ih with mesh diameter h ∈(0, ¯h) each of the linear
algebraic systems (2.2.14) has a unique solution Un (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1).
Hence the collocation equation (2.2.6) deﬁnes a unique collocation solution
uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for (2.2.5), with local representation on σn given by (2.2.9).
Proof Since the kernel K of the Volterra operator V is continuous on D,
the elements of the matrices Bn (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1) are all bounded. The
Neumann Lemma (cf. Ortega (1972, p. 26) or Atkinson (1989, p. 492))
then shows that the inverse of the matrix Bn := Im −hn Bn exists whenever
hn||Bn|| < 1 for some matrix norm. This clearly holds whenever hn is sufﬁ-
ciently small. In other words, there is an ¯h > 0 so that for any mesh Ih with
h := max{hn : 0 ≤n ≤N −1} < ¯h, each matrix Bn has a uniformly bounded
inverse. The assertion of Theorem 2.2.1 now follows.
When the collocation solution on the subinterval σn has been computed, the

The collocation solution is now determined by the resulting system (2.2.14) and
the local Lagrange representation (2.2.9) with m = 2, and (2.2.15) then yields
the iterated collocation solution on ¯σn.
2.2.3 The fully discretised collocation equation
We have seen in Section 1.1.1 that when an initial-value problem for an
ODE is solved by collocation in a piecewise polynomial space, for exam-
ple in S(0)
m (Ih), then the resulting collocation equation is completely discre-
tised and thus in a form feasible for numerical computation. When applying
the collocation method to Volterra integral (or integro-differential) equations,

2.2 Collocation for linear second-kind VIEs

this is in general not true: in the collocation equation (2.2.10) and the lag
term (2.2.11) corresponding to the VIE (2.2.5) the integrals cannot, in gen-
eral, be found analytically but have to be approximated by suitable numerical
quadrature formulas. Thus, the fully discretised version of (2.2.9) will have the
form
ˆuh(t) = g(t) + ( ˆVh ˆuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(2.2.18)
where ˆVh denotes some discretisation of the original Volterra integral oper-
ator V in (2.2.6). While in principle these integrals can be approximated to
any desired accuracy, the nature of the Volterra integral operator (memory
term!) makes such an approach prohibitively expensive, especially in long-
time integration problems and when solving systems of VIEs. On the other
hand we have to make sure that the quadrature formulas are order preserv-
ing; that is, they are such that the order of the resulting quadrature errors
will (at least) match the order of convergence of the exact collocation solu-
tion deﬁned by (2.2.6), either globally (on I), or at the mesh points Ih. We
shall see below, when carrying out the detailed error and convergence analy-
ses, that this can be achieved if we choose interpolatory m-point quadrature
formulas whose abscissas are given by, or based on, the m collocation param-
eters {ci}. To be more precise, we shall in the following employ the quadrature

The fully discretised collocation equation is obtained from the exact col-
location equation (2.2.10) by replacing the integrals by the above quadrature
approximations, disregarding the quadrature errors induced by this secondary
discretisation process. We shall denote the resulting discretised collocation so-
lution by ˆuh: it is, of course, still an element of our space S(−1)
m−1(Ih), but in
general we now have ˆuh ̸= uh. In analogy to (2.2.9) the local representation of
ˆuh on σn is

(2.2.23)

Theorem 2.2.2 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2.2.1 hold. Then there exists
an ˆh > 0 so that for any mesh Ih with mesh diameter h satisfying h ∈(0, ˆh)
there exists a unique discretised collocation approximation ˆuh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) de-
ﬁned by the unique solutions ˆUn of the linear algebraic systems (2.2.25)
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1) and the local representations (2.2.22).
The proof of Theorem 2.2.2 closely resembles the one for Theorem 2.2.1:
since, for any ﬁxed m, the weights {b j} of the interpolatory m-point quadrature
formulas underlying the discretised collocation equations (2.2.23) are bounded,
it follows from the Neumann Lemma that each matrix ˆBn := Im −hn ˆBn (n =
0, 1, . . . , N −1) in (2.2.25) possesses a uniformly bounded inverse whenever
hn < ˆh, for some suitable ˆh > 0, where in general ˆh ̸= ¯h.
For t = tn + vhn ∈σn the corresponding discretised iterated collocation
solution ˆuit
h corresponding to ˆuh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) in (2.2.18) is deﬁned by
ˆuit
h (tn + vhn) := g(tn + vhn) + ˆFn(tn + vhn) + hn( ˆQn ˆuh)(tn + vhn),
v ∈[0, 1].
(2.2.26)
The following two illustrations are the discrete counterparts of the exact
collocation methods described in Examples 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.

Setting ˆyn+1 := ˆuh(tn + vhn) = ˆUn,1, equation (2.2.25) yields

(2.2.25).
2.2.4 Global convergence results
Theorem 2.2.3 Assume:
(a) The given functions describing the Volterra integral equation (2.2.5) satisfy
K ∈Cm(D) and g ∈Cm(I).
(b) uh ∈S(−1)
m
(Ih) is the collocation solution to (2.2.5) deﬁned by (2.2.6) with
h ∈(0, ¯h).
Then
||y −uh||∞:= sup
t∈I
|y(t) −uh(t)| ≤C||y(m)||∞hm
(2.2.29)
holds for any set Xh of collocation points with 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1. The
constant C depends on the {ci} but not on h.
Since the dependence of the error bounds on certain derivatives of the exact
solution y will become apparent in the course of the proof, we will usually no
longer state this dependence explicitly in subsequent convergence theorems.
Proof The proof of course follows closely the one for Theorem 1.1.2, except
that now there is no continuity constraint at the the mesh points t1, . . . , tN−1.
Since assumption (a) implies y ∈Cm(I) we may resort to Peano’s Theorem
(Corollary 1.8.2 with d = m) to write
y(tn + vhn) =

(2.2.33)
We observe that it closely resembles (2.2.14): both systems are described by
the same matrix Bn := Im −hn Bn, while the role of gn is now assumed by
the sum of the remainder term vectors. Moreover, a glimpse at (1.1.31), the
ODE analogue of (2.2.33), reveals that the terms in (1.1.31) emanating from
the continuity requirements at the mesh points are here replaced by the terms
reﬂecting the memory term Veh.
It thus follows from the proof of Theorem 2.2.1 that we have again the
uniform bound
||(Im −hn Bn)−1||1 ≤D0
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1),
for all mesh diameters h with h ∈(0, ¯h). Assume that ||B(ℓ)

Gronwall inequality has the same form as the one encountered in the proof of

n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1.

uniformly for v ∈[0, 1] and 0 ≤n ≤N −1. The is equivalent to the estimate
||eh||∞≤C||y(m)||∞hm, as asserted in (2.2.30).
Remarks
1. An important problem that, to my knowldege, remains open concerns the
determination of an ‘optimal’, computable value of the error constant C
in Theorem 2.2.3, especially in long-time integration. (See, however, the
implementation of the collocation method on adaptive meshes discussed in
Blom and Brunner (1987, 1991).)
2. The convergence analysis of general one-step methods for second-kind
Volterra integral equation is given in Hairer, Lubich and Nørsett (1983).
The above proof shows that, as for ODEs, lower regularity in the solution
leads to a corresponding lower order of global convergence. We summarise this
result in Theorem 2.2.4 whose proof resorts again to Peano’s Theorem where
now m is replaced d < m.
Theorem 2.2.4 Suppose that (a) in Theorem 2.2.3 is replaced by the weaker as-
sumption g ∈Cd(I), K ∈Cd(D)), with 1 ≤d < m, implying that y ∈Cd(I).
Then
||y −uh||∞≤C||y(d)||∞hd.
(2.2.35)
The analysis in Section 1.1.3 has given a ﬁrst indication that global (and
local) superconvergence results for ODEs may not necessarily carry over to
second-kind Volterra integral equations. On the other hand, they might hold
for the iterated collocation solution. This is made precise in the following
theorem, the counterpart of Theorem 1.2.3 (Brunner and Yan (1996)), for global
superconvergence.

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
Theorem 2.2.5 Assume:
(a) g ∈Cm+1(I) and K ∈Cm+1(D);
(b) uh ∈S(−1)

location parameters {ci} satisfying the orthogonality condition
J0 :=

i=1
(s −ci)ds = 0.
Then the iterated collocation solution,
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Vuh)(t),
t ∈I,
is globally superconvergent on I, with
||y −uit
h ||∞≤Chm+1,
(2.2.36)
where C is depends on the {ci} and on ||y(m+1)||∞but not on h.
Proof In analogy to (1.1.36) we deﬁne the defect (or residual) associated with
the collocation solution uh to the VIE (2.2.5) by
δh(t) := −uh(t) + g(t) + (Vuh)(t),
t ∈I,
with δh(t) = 0 whenever t ∈Xh. Under the regularity assumptions for g and K
it is piecewise Cm+1, and Theorem 2.2.3 implies that it has uniformly bounded
derivatives on each subinterval σn (Exercise 2.5.14). Since eh = y −uh, with
y denoting the solution of (2.2.5), we also have
δh(t) = eh(t) −(Veh)(t),
t ∈I.
(2.2.37)
Thus, it follows from (2.2.29) and (2.2.37) that
||δh||∞≤||eh||∞+ ¯K||eh||∞≤C(1 + ¯K)hm := D1hm,
with
¯K := ||V||∞= max

The defect and the collocation error are related by equation (2.2.37) which we
write as

t ∈I,
(2.2.38)
and the iterated collocation error eit
h := y −uit
h has the property that
eit
h (t) = eh(t) −δh(t),
t ∈I.

2.2 Collocation for linear second-kind VIEs
97
Thus, denoting by R = R(t, s) the resolvent kernel of K(t, s) we know from
Section 2.1.1 (Theorem 2.1.1) that the solution of the Volterra equation (2.2.38)
is given by
eh(t) = δh(t) +
 t
0
R(t, s)δh(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(2.2.39)
(We note that since δh is only piecewise continuous (but bounded) on I, (2.2.38)
and the representation of eh given by (2.2.39) are to be interpreted in the corre-
sponding way, that is, for each subinterval σn.) The above thus implies
eit
h (t) =
 t
0
R(t, s)δh(s)ds,

(2.2.40)
Formally this reminds us immediately of equation (1.1.38) which we encoun-
tered in the proof of the global superconvergence result for ODEs. Therefore,
the arguments based on replacing the various integrals over subintervals making
up a given interval [0, tn + vhn] (v ∈[0, 1]) carry over to the present situation,
where the role of r(t, s) is assumed by R(t, s). More precisely, it is easy to see
that instead of (1.1.41) we now obtain

This readily leads to the completion of the proof of Theorem 2.2.5.
2.2.5 Local superconvergence results
Will collocation using the collocation points Xh corresponding to the m Gauss
points {ci} yield a collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to the Volterra integral
equation (2.2.5) for which
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uh(t)| = O(h2m)
holds, in analogy to the result of Corollary 1.1.5 for ODEs? A ﬁrst indication
that this will not be true can already be found in Section 1.1.5 (Corollary 1.1.10):
we showed that collocation in S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for the integrated form of a linear ODE
will not coincide with the ‘direct’ collocation solution in S(0)
m (Ih) for the given
ODE when the collocation parameters are the Gauss points. These observations
suggest the conjecture that the above local superconvergence result will be true

m−1(Ih) is p∗= 2(m −1).
For m = 2 the local order on Ih coincides with the global order on I, namely
p∗= p = m = 2.
The above analysis gives rise to the following question regarding repeated
iterated collocation: if we deﬁne uit
1,h := uit
h and
uit
µ+1,h := g(t) + (Vuit
µ,h)(t),
t ∈I
(µ ≥1),
what can be said about the resulting order and, more importantly, the behaviour
of the error constants? It is clear that the order of (local) superconvergence
cannot be increased. To understand this, observe ﬁrst that it follows from
uit

t ∈I,
that

Hence, an induction argument readily leads to
Theorem 2.2.10 For µ ≥1 the µth iterate uit

more concrete answers to the above question. We leave this as an exercise
(Exercise 2.5.20).
A result related to that in Theorem 2.2.9 can be found in Brunner, Lin and
Yan (1996): it deals with iterative correction techniques (see also Q. Lin (1979),

if uh is replaced by the iterated collocation solution uit
h . The following theorem
shows that this is indeed so.
Theorem 2.2.6 Assume that the given functions in (2.2.5) satisfy g ∈Cm+κ(I)
and K ∈Cm+κ(D) for some integer κ with 1 ≤κ ≤m. If the collocation pa-
rameters {ci} are chosen so that the orthogonality conditions

i=1
(s −ci)ds = 0,
ν = 0, . . . , κ −1,
(2.2.42)
hold, with Jκ ̸= 0, then the (optimal) order estimate
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uit
h (t)| ≤Chm+κ
(2.2.43)
is true whenever h ∈(0, ¯h).
If, in addition to (2.2.42), we have cm = 1, then local superconvergence is
obtained for the collocation solution uh itself:
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Chm+κ.
(2.2.44)
Here, κ cannot exceed m −1.
Proof Recall (2.2.40): for t = tn the expression for the iterated collocation
error can be written as

R(tn, tℓ+ shℓ)δh(tℓ+ shℓ)ds
(n = 1, . . . , N).
Hence, a glimpse at the corresponding expression (1.1.38) in Section 1.1.2
reveals that the arguments used in the proof of Theorem 1.1.4 carry over to the
present situation, leading straightforwardly to the assertions of Theorem 2.2.6.
Corollary 2.2.7 Let κ = m. Collocation at the corresponding Gauss points
yields
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uit
h (t)| ≤Ch2m,
but only
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uh(t)| = O(hm).
Note the second estimate is a consequence of the estimate |δh(tn)| = O(hm)
whenever cm < 1.
Corollary 2.2.8 If κ = m −1 and cm = 1, the {ci} are the Radau II points,
leading to
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Ch2m−1.

mention also that Porter and Stirling (1993) studied the convergence proper-
ties of repeated iterated Galerkin solutions to second-kind Fredholm integral
equations.
2.2.6 Optimal orders for the discretised collocation solutions
Do the discretised collocation solution ˆuh and the corresponding iterate ˆuit
h
possess the same order as the exact collocation approximations uh and uit
h ; in
particular, do the local superconvergence results of Theorem 2.2.6 remain valid
for ˆuh and/or ˆuit
h ? The answer is in the afﬁrmative if, as in Section 2.2.3, the
quadrature processes employ interpolatory m-point quadrature formulas whose
abscissas are based on the collocation parameters {ci}.
In order to understand this, observe ﬁrst that we have
|y(t) −ˆuh(t)| ≤|y(t) −uh(t)| + |uh(t) −ˆuh(t)| =: eh(t) + zh(t),
t ∈I.
(2.2.46)
Global and local estimates for the exact collocation error eh were established
in Sections 2.2.4 and 2.2.5. In order to analyse the perturbation zh induced by
the quadrature processes, recall that uh and ˆuh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) are, respectively, the
exact and discretised collocation solutions to (2.2.5) deﬁned by
uh(t) = g(t) + (Vuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
and
ˆuh(t) = g(t) + (Vh ˆuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
corresponding to
(Vuh)(tn,i) = Fn(tn,i) + hn(Qnuh)(tn,i)
and
(Vh ˆuh)(tn,i) = ˆFn(tn,i) + hn( ˆQn ˆuh)(tn,i).
Here, the lag terms are given by
Fn(tn,i) =

(cf. (2.2.19) and (2.2.20)). We will denote by E(ℓ)
n (tn,i) (ℓ< n) and En(tn,i)
the quadrature errors associated with these quadrature approximations
( ˆQ(ℓ)
n ˆuh)(tn,i) and ( ˆQn ˆuh)(tn,i). This allows us to write
( ˆQ(ℓ)
n ˆuh)(tn,i) = (Q(ℓ)
n ˆuh)(tn,i) −E(ℓ)
n (tn,i) (ℓ< n),
and
( ˆQn ˆuh)(tn,i) = (Qn ˆuh)(tn,i) −En(tn,i).
Thus, setting
zh(tn + vhn) := uh(tn + vhn) −ˆuh(tn + vhn) =


j=1
L j(v)Zn, j,
v ∈(0, 1],
(2.2.47)
with Zn, j := Un, j −ˆUn, j, it follows from the above collocation equations, upon
replacing the quadrature approximations by the difference between the exact
integrals and the quadrature errors, that the vector Zn := (Zn,1, . . . , Zn,m)T
solves the linear algebraic system
Zn,i =
n−1

ℓ=0
hℓ(Q(ℓ)
n zh)(tn,i) + hn(Qnzh)(tn,i) + ϵn(tn,i) (i = 1, . . . , m),
(2.2.48)
where
ϵn(tn,i) :=
n−1

ℓ=0
hℓE(ℓ)
n (tn,i) + hn En(tn,i).
This algebraic system can be written as

ℓ=0
hℓB(ℓ)
n Zℓ+ ϵn,
(2.2.49)
with ϵn := (ϵn(tn,1), . . . , ϵn(tn,m))T . Its structure is similar to that of (2.2.33),
and hence it leads again to a discrete Gronwall inequality analogous to (2.2.34),
except that now the non-homogeneous term is governed by an upper bound
for ||ϵn||1. If the quadrature formulas have degree of precision p (where p ≥
m −1), then

fact that n−1
ℓ=0 hℓ≤T (n ≤N).

The analysis is now readily completed: since ||Zn|| satisﬁes the discrete
Gronwall inequality
||Zn||1 ≤γ0h
n−1

ℓ=0
||Zℓ||1 + γ1h p
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1),
it follows that ||Zn||1 ≤γ h p and so, by (2.2.47),
|zh(tn + vhn)| ≤


j=1
|L j(v)| · |Zn, j| ≤m||Zn||1 ≤mγ h p,
where m := max( j) ||L j||∞. This estimate is valid uniformly for v ∈[0, 1]
and n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1, for all meshes Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h).
It is obvious that this perturbation analysis can also be used to deal with the
effect of the full discretisation on the iterated collocation error: if we deﬁne
zit
h (t) := uit
h (t) −ˆuit
h (t) then it follows from the deﬁnition of the exact iterated
collocation solution and its discretised counterpart (recall (2.2.17) and (2.2.26))
that the above equation (2.2.48) is to be replaced by
zit
h (tn + vhn) =
n−1

ℓ=0
hℓ(Q(ℓ)
n zh)(tn +vhn) + hn(Qnzh)(tn + vhn) + ϵn(tn + vhn),
with v ∈[0, 1], and this leads to the expected order results, both globally on I
and locally on the mesh points Ih, thus extending Theorems 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 to
||y −ˆuit
h ||∞and max(Ih) |y(t) −ˆuit
h (t)|, respectively. Moreover, the same ideas
can be used to deal with the fully discretised collocation methods for other
types of Volterra integral and (functional) integro-differential equations. In the
following chapters we will usually not explicitly state the convergence results
corresponding to fully discretised collocation solutions since they can easily
be obtained by adapting the above analysis. We will, however, summarise the
insight obtained presently in Theorem 2.2.11: it represents the discrete analogue
of Theorems 2.2.5 and 2.2.6.
Theorem 2.2.11 Assume that the collocation equation deﬁning the exact col-
location solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) and the corresponding iterated collocation so-
lution uit
h for (2.2.5) are discretised by using interpolatory m-point quadrature
formulas whose absissas are based on the collocation parameters {ci}. Then
the resulting discretised collocation approximations ˆuh and ˆuit
h have the same
(optimal) global and local optimal convergence properties as uh and uit
h .
Remark Discretised collocation methods, in the past often called block meth-
ods, were analysed by Weiss (1972a) and by de Hoog and Weiss (1975). The

103
connection between these methods and (exact) collocation methods was studied
in Brunner (1977).
2.2.7 Divergence of collocation solutions in smoother
collocation spaces
We have observed in Section 1.1.5 (Theorem 1.1.9 and Corollary 1.1.10)
that if uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the collocation solution for the initial-value problem
y′(t) = ay(t), t ∈I, y(0) = y0, and if vit
h denotes the iterated collocation so-
lution corresponding to vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for the integrated form of the initial-value
problem,
y(t) = y0 +
 t
0
ay(s)ds,
t ∈I,
then uh(t) = vit
h for all t ∈I. We will now show that this result remains true for
moregeneral,smoothpiecewisepolynomialcollocationspaces S(d)
µ (Ih (d < µ).
An important consequence of this result will be that it allows us to extend
M¨ulthei’s divergence theory for collocation solutions for ODEs (described in
Section 1.3.1) to second-kind VIEs.
Theorem 2.2.12 Let µ and d be any positive integers satisfying d < µ, and let
X(d)
h
:= {tn + cihn : 0 < c1 < . . . < cµ−d ≤1 (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1)}
denote the set of collocation points associated with the mesh Ih and the given
µ −d (distinct) collocation parameters {ci}. If uh ∈S(d)
µ (Ih) is the collocation
solution deﬁned by
u′
h(t) = auh(t),
t ∈X(d)
h ,
uh(0) = y0
(a ̸= 0),

since the kernel of the VIE does not depend on t.
In order to bring the proof to its conclusion we ﬁrst observe that:
(i) The matrices V (d)

and W (d)
n
on the left-hand sides of (2.2.53) and (2.2.54)
are identical: V (d)

(iii) Since y′(t) = ay(t), we have y(ν)(0) = ay(ν−1)(0) (ν = 1, . . . , d).
(iv) The following relationship between uh and vit
h is obvious:

106
2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
straightforward induction argument (and an obvious change of the variables of
summation j in (2.4.54) and ν in the ﬁrst term on its right-hand side), we ﬁnd
that for all n,
u(ν)
h (tn) = y(ν)
n

h )(ν)(tn) (n = 1, . . . , N −1),
and hence, αn = γγn, that is,
αn, j = hnaγn, j−1
( j = d + 1, . . . , µ; n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1).
By combining all these observations we can now easily convince ourselves that
the assertion of Theorem 2.2.11 is indeed true.
Remark As we indicated in Section 1.3.1, an obvious alternative to the above
local representations of uh and vh are the ones based on the Hermite canonical
polynomials with respect to the {ci} (see Exercise 2.5.26).
Corollary 2.2.14 Assume that the collocation solution uh ∈S(d)
µ (Ih) for the
initial-value problem for y′(t) = ay(t) is divergent. Then both the iterated col-
location solution vit
h and the underlying collocation solution vh ∈S(d−1)
µ−1 (Ih),
based on the same (distinct) collocation points X(d)
h , for the second-kind VIE
(2.2.5) are also divergent.
Proof We simply note that

t ∈I,
where
K0 := max

 t

|K(t, s)|ds = |a|T.
We described divergence results for collocation solutions to ODEs (due
mainly to Loscalzo and Talbot (1967) and M¨ulthei (1979, 1980a)) in Section
1.3.1. Hence, Theorem 2.2.11 and Corollary 2.2.13 provide the basis for the
analogous divergence theory for second-kind VIEs. The ﬁrst convergence and
divergence results for second-kind VIEs are due to Hung (1970) and to El Tom
(1971, 1974, 1976). A more general (stability) analysis can be found in the
recent papers by Oja (2001a, 2001b) and Oja and Saveljeva (2002).
The equivalence result of Theorem 2.2.11 and Corollary 2.2.13 allows us to
establish the complete divergence theory of piecewise polynomial collocation
methods for second-kind VIEs. We state a number of representative results,
starting with the case of simple parameters {ci}. Similar results on collocation
using parameters with higher multiplicity will be given in Section 2.2.8. Revert-
ing to our standard notation, using again uh, instead of vh, to denote a collocation

2.2 Collocation for linear second-kind VIEs
107
solution to the VIE (2.2.5), we conclude this section by stating the analogue
of Theorem 1.3.4. The results for Hermite-type collocation (corresponding to
Theorem 1.3.1 and Corollary 1.3.2) will be given in Section 2.2.8.
The analogue of Corollary 1.3.2 for second-kind VIEs is due to Hung (1970).
Theorem 2.2.15 The collocation solution uh ∈S(2)
3 (Ih) for (2.2.5), with c1 =
1, is divergent.
A more general result is given in Theorem 2.2.16: it corresponds to Theorem
1.3.4 for ODEs.
Theorem 2.2.16 Let uh ∈S(d−1)
µ−1 (Ih) (d < µ) be the collocation solution for
the second-kind VIE (2.2.5), with collocation parameters 0 < c1 < . . . < cr =
1 possessing multiplicities δi = 1 (hence r = µ −d). If d ≥2 then uh is diver-
gent whenever
r−1

i=1
1 −ci
ci
> 1.
Proof The above divergence result is implied by Theorem 1.3.4 (δi = 1 for all
i, and d = 2 = δr + 1) and by Corollary 2.2.14.
Corollary 2.2.17 If uh ∈S(1)
µ−1(Ih) is the collocation solution corresponding to
the µ −2 Radau II points, then uh is divergent.
Proof This divergence result follows from Corollary 1.3.5 and Corollary
2.2.14.
2.2.8 Hermite-type collocation methods
Assume now that some of the collocation parameters ci have multiplicities
δi > 1. In analogy to Section 1.3, the collocation solution uh ∈S(d−1)
µ−1 (Ih) is
now determined by the collocation equation
u(ν)
h (tn,i) = g(ν)(tn,i) + d
dt (Vuh)(tn,i),
ν = 0, . . . , δi −1;
i = 1, . . . ,r,
(2.2.56)
with initial values u(ν)
h (0) = y(ν)(0) (ν = 0, . . . , d −1). Setting

adapted to encompass this more general situation; hence the equivalence result
remains valid. This allows us to deduce the following divergence statements.

108
2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
Theorem 2.2.18 Let uh ∈S(d−1)
µ−1 (Ih) (1 ≤d < µ) be the collocation solution
for the VIE (2.2.5), corresponding to the collocation parameters satisfying
0 < c1 < . . . < cr−1 < cr = 1 and possessing multiplicities δ1, . . . , δr, so that
δi > 1 for at least one i.
If d is such that d = δr + 1 (≥2) then uh is divergent whenever

Theorem 2.2.19 The Hermite collocation solution uh ∈S(m)
2m−1(Ih), with q =
m −1 and c1 = 1, is divergent for second-kind VIEs.
The proof is a consequence of the second part in Example 1.3.2.
Remarks
1. Esser (1978) showed that Hermite collocation for second-kind VIEs in
S(m−1)
2m−1 (Ih) (with c1 = 1 having multiplicity δ1 = m) is convergent.
2. M¨ulthei’s convergence results for ODEs (M¨ulthei (1980a, 1980b, 1980c,
1982a)) do not necessarily imply analogous convergence results for VIEs,
since a linear second-kind VIE is in general not reducible to a ﬁrst-order
ODE. Except for some partial results by Oja et al. mentioned above, the
convergence analysis of piecewise polynomial collocation solutions to VIEs
is still incomplete.
2.2.9 Multidimensional VIEs of the second kind
We have seen in Section 2.1.7 that the second-kind VIE,
u(x, y) = g(x, y) + (Vu)(x, y),
(x, y) ∈ := [0, X] × [0, Y],
(2.2.57)
with Volterra integral operator V : C() →C() given by
(Vφ)(x, y) :=
 x
0
 y
0
K(x, ξ, y, η)φ(ξ, η)dη dξ,
possesses a unique solution u ∈C() whenever g and K are continuous on
 and D2 := {(x, ξ, y, η) : 0 ≤ξ ≤x ≤X, 0 ≤η ≤y ≤Y}, respectively.
Moreover, as in the one-dimensional case it can be represented by a variation-
of-constants formula (resolvent representation), as shown in Theorem 2.1.14.
This suggests that the convergence results derived in Section 2.2 will also carry
over to collocation solutions and their iterates for the above VIE.
We will give a brief description of the collocation method and a summary
of the corresponding (super-) convergence results; details and proofs are along
familiar lines and can also be found in Brunner and Kauthen (1989).

Ih := {x j : 0 = x0 < x1 < . . . < xM = X},
Jk := {yl : 0 = y0 < y1 < . . . < yN = Y},
h j := x j+1 −x j,
kl := yl+1 −yl;
h := max
( j) h j,
k := max
(l) kl,
and set h,k := Ih × Jk. The collocation space will be
S(−1)
m−1,µ−1(h,k) := {v : v|σ j,l ∈πm−1,µ−1 (0 ≤j ≤M −1, 0 ≤l ≤N −1)},
where σ j,l := (x j, x j+1] × (yl, yl+1] and πm−1,µ−1 := πm−1 ⊗πµ−1. The di-
mension of this linear space is M Nmµ, and hence the set of collocation points,
Zh,k := Xh × Yk, will be based on the sets
Xh := {x j + cih j : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤j ≤M −1)},
Yk := {yl + dikl : 0 ≤d1 < . . . < dµ ≤1 (0 ≤l ≤N −1)}.
The collocation solution uh,k to (2.2.57) is the element of S(−1)
m−1,µ−1(h,k) that
satisﬁes the collocation equation
uh,k(x, y) = g(x, y) + (Vuh,k)(x, y),
(x, y) ∈Zh,k,
(2.2.58)
and the corresponding iterated collocation solution is determined by
uit
h,k(x, y) := g(x, y) + (Vuh,k)(x, y),
(x, y) ∈.
(2.2.59)
Note that uit
h,k ∈C(); this is true for uh,k only if m ≥2 and c1 = d1 = 0, cm =
dµ = 1.
We leave the derivation of the computational forms of the above collocation
equations to the reader: since the collocation space is a tensor-product space,
the local representation of uh,k on a subregion σ j,l is the tensor product of the
two familiar one-dimensional local Lagrange representations.
Theorem 2.2.20 Assume that g ∈Cd() and K ∈Cd(D2), for some d ≥0.
(i) There exists ¯H > 0 so that (2.2.58) deﬁnes a unique collocation solution
uh,k ∈S(−1)
m−1,µ−1(h,k) for all meshes h,k with h, k ∈(0, ¯H).
(ii) If d ≥m, then
sup{|u(x, y) −uh,k(x, y)| : (x, y) ∈} ≤C H ρ,
ρ := min{m, µ}.
Here, H := max{h, k}, and the estimate is true for arbitrary collocation
parameters {ci} and {di}.

Analogous results are true for the discretised collocation solutions ˆuh,k and

h,k, provided the (tensor product) quadrature formulas are of interpolatory
type and based on the collocation parameters {ci} and {di}, respectively. See
also Stroud (1971) for details and expressions for the quadrature errors (and the
underlying two-dimensional version of the Peano Kernel Theorem).
2.2.10 Comparison with collocation for Fredholm
integral equations
In order to gain a better perspective on the superconvergence results for Volterra
integral equations, we brieﬂy look at collocation methods for linear Fredholm
integral equations of the second kind,
y(t) = g(t) + λ(F y)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(2.2.60)
where λ denotes a (real or complex) parameter and where the Fredholm integral
operator F : C(I) →C(I) is deﬁned by
(Fφ)(t) :=
 T
0
K(t, s)φ(s)ds,
K ∈C(I × I).
We will assume that λ−1 is not in the spectrum σ(F) of the Fredholm integral
operator F; that is, I −λF is invertible in C(I).
The collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for (2.2.60) is determined by
uh(t) = g(t) + λ(Fuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(2.2.61)

TheconvergenceanalysisofcollocationmethodsforFredholmintegralequa-
tions of the second kind dates back to the work of Kadner (1960, 1967); of the
many papers dealing with superconvergence properties of piecewise colloca-
tion solutions (also in Galerkin methods) we cite those by Sloan (1976, 1984,
1988a, 1990), Chandler (1979), Chatelin and Lebbar (1981), Brunner (1984a),
Joe (1985a, 1985b); see also the monographs by Chatelin (1983), Golberg
and Chen (1997), and Atkinson (1997a). As the following theorem shows, the
fundamental difference between superconvergence results for Volterra and for
Fredholm integral equations is that in the latter case, high-order (e.g. O(h2m)-)
convergence for uit
h holds globally on I.
Theorem 2.2.21 Assume:
(a) g ∈Cm+κ(I), K ∈Cm+κ(I × I);
(b) λ−1 ̸∈σ(F);

Then for all sufﬁciently small h > 0, the collocation solution uh is supercon-
vergent on Xh:
max
t∈Xh |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Cκhm+κ,
and the iterated collocation solution exhibits the same order of superconver-
gence on the entire interval I:
||y −uit
h ||∞≤Cκhm+κ.
A proof of these results, along the lines of the one for VIEs (Section 2.2.5)
may be found in Brunner (1984a); see also the survey paper by Brunner (1987).
The analysis of the attainable order when the solution of (2.2.57) does not have
full regularity was analysed in detail by Joe (1985a, 1985b).
Remark The above analysis and the results derived in Section 2.2.9 readily
suggest that the global superconvergence result of Theorem 2.2.19 for uit
h will
remain valid for the analogous iterated collocation solution to
u(x, y) = g(x, y) + (Fu)(x, y),

2.2.11 Collocation for Volterra–Fredholm integral equations
We have seen in Section 2.1.6 that in the analysis of ‘mixed’ integral equations
of the form
u(t, x) = g(t, x) + (T u)(t, x),
(t, x) ∈I × J := [0, T ] × [0, X], (2.2.63)

it is the Volterra part of the integral operator T that dominates the existence
of solutions (Theorem 2.1.13). Hence, we intuitively expect that the (super-)
convergence properties of (iterated) collocation solutions to (2.2.63) will also
be governed to some extent by the Volterra integral operator making up T . In
order to state the precise convergence results, we adopt a notation similar to the
one in Section 2.2.9: we set τ,h := Iτ × Jh, with
Iτ := {tn : 0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tn = T },
τn := tn+1 −tn,
Jh := {x j : 0 = x0 < x1 < . . . < xM = X},
h j := x j+1 −x j,
and τ := max(n) τn, h := max( j) h j. The collocation space based on the mesh
τ,h will be
S(−1)
m−1,µ−1(τ,h) := {v : v ∈πm−1,µ−1 on each subregion (tn, tn+1]
×(x j, x j+1]}.
Accordingly, we will work with the collocation points Xτ × Yh, deﬁned by
Xτ := {tn + ciτn : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1)},
and
Yh := {x j + dih j : 0 ≤d1 < . . . < dµ ≤1 ( j = 0, 1, . . . , M −1)}.
The collocation solution uτ,h ∈S(−1)
m−1,µ−1(τ,h) to (2.2.63) and its iterate uit
τ,h
are then respectively deﬁned by
uτ,h(t, x) = g(t, x) + (T uτ,h)(t, x),
(t, x) ∈Xτ × Yh,
(2.2.64)
and
uit
τ,h(t, x) := g(t, x) + (T uτ,h)(t, x),
(t, x) ∈.
(2.2.65)
However, since in physical or biological problems leading to the VFIE (2.2.63)
the independent variable t represents time, we will also consider the continuous-
time collocation equation: for t ∈I it deﬁnes a collocation solution Vh(t) ∈
S(−1)
µ−1(Jh) by means of
Vh(t, x) = g(t, x) + (T Vh)(t, x),
x ∈Yh
(t ∈I);
its iterate is
V it
h (t, x) := g(t, x) + (T Vh)(t, x),
x ∈J
(t ∈I).
The time-stepping scheme is then described by the collocation approximation
Uτ,h to Vh(t, x) with respect to t, using the space S(−1)
m−1(Iτ) as the collocation
space. We obviously have Uτ,h = uτ,h.

h (t, x) were analysed by Kauthen (1989a, 1989b) (for (2.2.63)),

{ci} and {di} deﬁning the sets Xτ and Yh satisfy the orthogonality conditions
stated in Theorem 2.2.14. Then:

(ii) max{|u(t, x) −V it

(iii) max{|u(t, x) −uτ,h(t, x)| : x ∈J, t ∈Iτ \ {0}} ≤C H ρ∗,
with ρ∗:= min{m + κ1, µ + κ2} and H := max{τ, h}.

extended to encompass nonlinear VIEs, and in particular the Hammerstein

While leaving the details to the reader we just state that, under appropriate

m−1(Ih)
induces an error whose order is described by
||y −uh||∞≤Chm,
and this holds for any {ci} with 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1.
2.3.2 Local superconvergence results for nonlinear V2s
For nonlinear VIEs (2.1.36) with sufﬁciently regular solutions the global and
local superconvergence results of Theorems 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 remain valid. This is
not surprising because if we employ Taylor’s theorem with quadratic remainder
term, we may write the equation for the collocation error,
eh(t) = δh(t) +

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
Here, η(s) := y(t) −θeh(s) for some θ with 0 < θ < 1. We deduce from the
order of global convergence of uh that
|T2(t)| = O(||eh||2
∞) = O(h2m),
t ∈I,
provided fyy(t, s, ·) is bounded on D ×  for some  ⊂IR. Denoting the re-
solvent kernel associated with the kernel H0(t, s) by R0(t, s), the solution of
the linearised error equation can be written as
eh(t) = δh(t) + T2(t) +
 t
0
R0(t, s) (δh(s) + T2(s)) ds,
t ∈I.
Hence, the statements on the attainable order of eh(t) at t = tn (n = 1, . . . , N)
follow from the familiar quadrature arguments based on the degree of precision
of the interpolatory quadrature formulas with the collocation points as abscissas.
Inotherwords,thesuperconvergenceresultsofTheorems2.2.5and2.2.6remain
valid for nonlinear VIEs.
Remark As in the case of nonlinear ODEs (Section 1.1.4) an alternative proof
can be based on the nonlinear ‘variation-of-constants formula’ for the VIE
(2.1.36) (see Beesack (1987)). Note, however, that the formula given originally
in Bernfeld and Lord (1978) is not correct.
2.3.3 Hammerstein-type VIEs: implicitly linear collocation
We have seen at the end of Section 2.1.5 that the Volterra–Hammerstein integral
equation
y(t) = g(t) + (Hy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(2.3.2)
with
(Hy)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds,
can be rewritten in a form that leads to a computationally more attractive version
of the collocation method. This form is based on the Niemytzki operator (or:
substitution operator) N,
z(t) := (N y)(t) := G(t, y(t)),
t ∈I,
(2.3.3)
which permits the recasting of (2.3.2) as an ‘implicitly linear’ Volterra integral
equation,
z(t) = (N(g + Vz)(t) = G(t, g(t) + (Vz)(t)),
t ∈I,
(2.3.4)

The solution to the original VIE (2.3.2) is then obtained by the iteration

(2.3.5)
We now approximate z by the collocation solution zh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih),
zh(t) = G(t, g(t) + (Vzh)(t)),
t ∈Xh,
(2.3.6)
and deﬁne the approximation yh to the solution y of the original VIE by

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
can be found analytically, thus avoiding the need for quadrature approximations.
A more important advantage of implicitly linear collocation lies in the fact that,
in contrast to direct collocation for (2.3.2), the integrals need not be re-computed
for every iteration step when solving the nonlinear algebraic system (2.3.9),
or when computing the approximation yh(t) for different values of t ∈I by
(2.3.10).
Remark Implicitly linear collocation methods (called ‘new collocation-type
methods’) were ﬁrst introduced for Fredholm integral equations in Kumar and
Sloan(1987)andKumar(1987);seealsoBrunner(1991,1992b),Frankel(1995)
and Kaneko, Noren and Padilla (1997).
It turns out that the approximation yh obtained by implicitly linear colloca-
tion and the iterated collocation solution uit
h generated by ‘direct’ collocation
are closely related and, for certain kernels, essentially identical. Thus, for judi-
ciously chosen collocation parameters both approaches yield superconvergent
approximations of the same global and local orders. This is made precise in the
following theorem.
Theorem 2.3.1 Assume that:
(a) The given functions g, K and G in (2.3.2) are continuous on their domains,
and G is such that the VHIE possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I).
(b) yh is the approximation to the solution y of the Volterra–Hammerstein
equation (2.3.2) obtained by implicitly linear collocation and deﬁned by
(2.3.6), (2.3.7).
(c)
ˆuit
h denotes the discretised iterated collocation solution corresponding to
the ‘direct’ collocation solution ˆuh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) deﬁned by the fully discre-
tised collocation equation (2.3.11) below, using the same collocation points
Xh as for the computation of zh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) in (2.3.6).
Then
ˆuit
h (t) = yh(t) for all
t ∈I.
Proof If we solve the given Volterra–Hammerstein equation (2.3.2) by ‘direct’
collocation, then the exact collocation equation is
uh(t) = g(t) + (Huh)(t),
t ∈I,
and the exact iterated collocation solution is found from
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Huh)(t),
t ∈I.

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
We wish to show that ˆVn,i = Zn,i (i = 1, . . . , m; n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1), where
the Zn,i are deﬁned by the solution of the nonlinear algebraic system (2.3.9).
This is readily veriﬁed by induction, using the obvious fact that the assertion is
true for n = 0. We leave the remaining details of this simple proof to the reader.
In view of applications the kernel will usually be of convolution type,
K(t, s) = k(t −s), and hence the quadrature weights in (2.3.11)–(2.3.14) have
an analogous structure, e.g.
wn,ν(v) :=
 v
0
k((v −s)hn)Lν(s)ds, v ∈(0, 1].
For K(t, s) ≡1 we obtain the result of Theorem 1.1.9 for the special Volterra–
Hammerstein integral equation arising in the integrated form of the initial-value
problem y′(t) = f (t, y(t)), y(0) = y0.
2.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs
2.4.1 The exact collocation equations for S(−1)

deﬁned by
(Vφ)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)φ(s)ds,
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(2.4.1)
is in C1(D) and is strictly non-zero along the line t = s of I; that is, |K(t, t)| ≥
k0 > 0 for all t ∈I. According to Theorem 2.1.8 the ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral
equation
(Vy)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I,
(2.4.2)
then possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I) for any g ∈C1(I) with g(0) = 0.
Since (Vy)(0) = 0 the parameters {ci} underlying the set Xh of collocation
points will have to satisfy
0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1,
both for the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) and the one in the continuous
space S(0)
m (Ih). We will see, however, that these collocation solutions will con-
verge uniformly on I to the solution y of (2.4.1), as h →0, only under rather
stringent conditions on the {ci}. In particular, while collocation at the Gauss
points will yield a convergent collocation solution in S(−1)
m−1(Ih) (with possible
order reduction), the collocation solution in S(0)
m (Ih) for the same collocation
points turns out to be divergent.

(2.4.6)
Is this matrix non-singular, at least for sufﬁciently small values of hn? We
observe that its elements sample the kernel K(t, s) only ‘near’ the boundary
t = s of D; hence, since K ∈C1(D) we may employ Taylor’s Theorem to write
K(tn,i, tn + shn) = K(tn, tn) + hn[ci Kt(tn + θ1cihn, tn + θ2shn)
+ sKs(tn + θ1cihn, tn + θ2shn)],
where θk ∈(0, 1) (k = 1, 2). Hence, the elements of the matrix Bn can be there-

where the ﬁrst matrix on the right-hand side is non-singular for all n =
0, 1, . . . , N −1, due to the linear independence of the (local) basis functions
{L j}.
Theorem 2.4.1 Assume that g and K in the ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equation
(2.4.2) satisfy
g ∈C1(I), g(0) = 0;
K ∈C1(D), |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0, t ∈I.
Thenthereexistsan ¯h > 0sothatforallmeshes Ih withdiameter h ∈(0, ¯h)each
of the linear algebraic systems (2.4.5) possesses a unique solution Un ∈IRm.
Hence, the collocation equation (2.4.3) deﬁnes a unique collocation solution
uh ∈S(0)
m−1(Ih) which on σn is given by (2.4.4).

cation solutions to ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equations in more general linear

Forθ = 1weobtainthecontinuousmidpointmethod(seealsoExample2.4.4for

2.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs
123
This collocation solution is convergent only if the collocation parameters are
chosen so that (1 −c1)(1 −c2) ≤c1c2 (see Theorem 2.4.2 below). The global
order of convergence is p = m = 2 for, e.g. the points c1 = 1/3, c2 = 1 (the
Radau II points) and c1 = 1/2, c2 = 1; in both cases we have ρm = 0 in (2.4.7).
If c1, c2 are the Gauss points (for which we have ρ2 = +1 in (2.4.7)) then we
obtain only O(h)-convergence.
2.4.2 Global convergence in S(−1)
m−1(Ih)
We have seen in Section 2.2.4 that for second-kind Volterra integral equations
the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) converges to the exact solution for any
choice of the collocation parameters {ci} with 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1. This is
no longer true for ﬁrst-kind VIEs, as the following theorem shows.
Theorem 2.4.2 Let d ≥m and assume that
(a) g ∈Cd+1(I), with g(0) = 0;
(b) K ∈Cd+1(D), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 for t ∈I;
(c) uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is the collocation solution deﬁned by the collocation equa-
tion (2.4.3).
Then for all uniform meshes Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h) the collocation solution uh con-
verges uniformly on I to the solution y of (2.4.2) if, and only if, the collocation
parameters satisfy the condition
−1 ≤ρm := (−1)m

The attainable global order of convergence is then described by
||y −uh||∞=
"O(hm)
if ρm ∈[−1, 1),
O(hm−1)
if ρm = 1.
(2.4.8)
Remark Recall that in Section 1.1.2 (following Theorem 1.1.3) we introduced
the collocation polynomial Mm(s) := (1/m!) #m
i=1(s −ci) associated with the
given collocation parameters {ci}. Thus, the above theorem can be rephrased, to
say that the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is convergent of (global) order
p = m if, and only if,
−1 ≤ρm = Mm(1)
Mm(0) < 1.
(2.4.9)
Proof The collocation error eh := y −uh is governed by the equations
(Veh)(tn,i) = 0,
i = 1, . . . , m
(0 ≤n ≤N −1).

Recall from Section 2.2.1 that dim S(0)
m (Ih) = Nm + 1. Thus, in order to com-
pute the collocation solution uh in this continuous collocation space from the
collocation equation (2.4.3) we need to prescribe an initial value; it can be
obtained from the differentiated form of (2.4.2) and is given by
uh(0) = y(0) =

K(0, 0) =: y0.

The analogue of the collocation equation (2.4.3) is: ﬁnd uh ∈S(0)

system of ﬁrst-order difference equations (2.4.12) remain uniformly bounded
(as N →∞) if, and only if, |λ1| = ρm ≤1. This completes the ﬁrst part of the
proof of Theorem 2.4.2.
Suppose now that cm < 1. If ρm ∈[−1, 1) then the proof that this yields
again O(hm)-convergence is almost identical to the one for cm = 1, as (2.4.12)
and the corresponding discrete Gronwall estimate show. If ρm = 1 then the
reason for the resulting order reduction is found in the following lemma (see,
e.g. Henrici (1962, p. 18)).
Lemma 2.4.4 Assume that {zn} (0 ≤n ≤N) is a sequence of non-negative

Our situation corresponds to the case A = 1, where A assumes the role of

matrix P−1Q now equals one) is a lower bound for any matrix norm induced by
a vector norm. Hence, the term nB corresponds to const · nhm and is bounded
by const · Nh · hm−1 = CT · hm−1.
Remark If the mesh sequence {Ih} is quasi-uniform, then we have hℓ/hn ≤γ

Illustration Numerical differentiation by collocation
If the kernel of V in (2.4.3) is given by K(t, s) ≡1 on D, then the solution
of the integral equation (4.4.2) is y(t) = g′(t), t ∈I, for any g ∈C1(I) with
g(0) = 0. Hence, Examples 2.4.1–2.4.3 yield simple (global) numerical dif-
ferentiation formulas of orders one and two. Since the kernel K(t, s) has now
the value one on D the integrals occurring in the collocation equations can be
evaluated analytically, leading to the desired differentiation formulas on, e.g.
the subinterval σ0 := (0, h] with h = 1. We leave their explicit derivation as an
exercise (see also Brunner and van der Houwen (1986, Section 5.5.2)).

BnUn = h−1

(2.4.19)
The matrix Bn and the vectors gn and Gn are as in (2.4.5).
Observe that the existence of a unique collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is
assured by Theorem 2.4.1 because in the systems of linear algebraic equations
(2.4.19) we have the same coefﬁcient matrices Bn as in (2.4.5).
Example 2.4.3 uh ∈S(0)

v ∈[0, 1],

It follows from Theorem 2.4.5 below that this method is convergent and its
global order of convergence is p = m + 1 = 2 (since c1 = 1).
The fully discretised (continuous) counterpart of this method will be derived
in Example 2.4.5.

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
We have seen in Section 2.4.1 that collocation in the discontinuous colloca-
tion space S(−1)
m−1(Ih) does not yield a uniformly convergent collocation solution
for any choice of the {ci}. Thus, it is intuitively clear that for uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to
be uniformly convergent on I the collocation parameters will have to obey an
even more restrictive condition than (2.4.7), due to the continuity constraints
now imposed on uh at the interior mesh points. In fact, as Theorem 2.4.6 below
shows, collocation at the Gauss points leads to a divergent uh.
We ﬁrst consider the case where cm = 1. We know from Theorem 2.4.2 that
if the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is based on collocation parameters
satisfying this condition, it will be uniformly convergent on I for any distinct
c1, . . . , cm−1 in (0, 1). This is no longer true in the collocation space S(0)
m (Ih),
as the following theorem makes clear (Brunner and van der Houwen (1986),
Kauthen and Brunner (1997)).
Theorem 2.4.5 Assume:
(a) g ∈Cm+3(I), with g(0) = 0;
(b) K ∈Cm+3(D), and |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 on I;
(c) uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the collocation solution deﬁned by (2.4.15) and (2.4.17),
with uniform mesh Ih.
If the collocation parameters {ci} are so that 0 < c1 < . . . < cm = 1, then uh
converges uniformly (on I) to the solution y of (2.4.2) if, and only if,
−1 ≤ρm−1 := (−1)m
m−1

i=1
1 −ci
ci
≤1.
(2.4.20)
For such collocation parameters the global order of convergence, as h →
0 (Nh = T ), is given by
||y −uh||∞=
"O(hm+1)
if −1 ≤ρm−1 < 1,
O(hm)
if ρm−1 = 1.
(2.4.21)
In the case where cm < 1 (for example if the {ci} are the Gauss points) the
convergence analysis is much more complex. The following theorem gives a
ﬁrst indication of this fact.
Theorem 2.4.6 Let g and K be subject to the assumptions in Theorem 2.4.5.
If cm < 1 and if the collocation parameters are symmetrical,
ci = cm+1−i,
i = 1, . . . , m,
then the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to (2.4.2) does not converge uni-
formly to y. In particular, the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
1 (Ih) corresponding
to c1 = 1/2 and uniform Ih is divergent as h →0.

2.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs
131
Proof See Kauthen and Brunner (1997). The techniques employed in the proof
are based on a connection between the collocation solution deﬁned by equa-
tion (2.4.3) and the value of the stability function at inﬁnity associated with
(continuous) Runge–Kutta methods for (stiff) ODEs.
We note that there exist non-symmetric sets {ci} for which the collocation
solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to (2.4.2) does converge uniformly on I. A detailed dis-
cussion of the construction and the numerical performance of such methods
can be found in Kauthen and Brunner (1997, pp. 1449–1452).
2.4.4 Is local superconvergence on Ih possible?
Do there exist sets of collocation parameters {ci} in (0, 1] for which the colloca-
tion solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) exhibits local superconvergence of order p∗> m
at the mesh points? The next theorem shows that the answer is negative. How-
ever, local superconvergence of (optimal) order p∗= m + 1 can occur at certain
non-mesh points.
Theorem 2.4.7 Assume:
(a) g ∈Cd(I), with d ≥m + 2 and non-trivial g satisfying g(0) = 0;
(b) K ∈Cd(D), with d ≥m + 2 and |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0, t ∈I;
(c) uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is the collocation solution deﬁned by (2.4.5), with distinct
collocation parameters ci ∈(0, 1].
Then:
(i) Local superconvergence of order p∗> m on Ih \ {0} is not possible for uh.
(ii) If Xh is based on collocation parameters {ci} given by the zeros of (s −1)
P′
m(2s −1) (the m + 1 Lobatto points minus the point 0), and if the set
Yh := {tn + dihn : 0 < d1 < . . . < dm < 1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}
corresponds to the Gauss points {di} (the zeros of Pm(2s −1)), then
max
t∈Yh |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Chm+1 :
local superconvergence of order p∗= m + 1 occurs at the Gauss (–
Legendre) points in each subinterval σn. In particular, for odd values of
m we have
max
1≤n<N |y(tn+ 1
2 ) −uh(tn+ 1
2 )| ≤Chm+1.
Remark Note that the set Yh of points at which local superconvergence can
occur is not unique (Exercise 2.5.19). Compare also Brunner (1978, 1979a,
1979b) and Eggermont (1982, 1983, 1986) for additional details.

v ∈(0, 1],
with
¯Un, j := uh(tn + d jhn).

eh(tn + vhn) =

We wish to show that for certain choices of the collocation parameters {ci}
there exist sets {di} (with a prominent example speciﬁed in Theorem 2.4.7) so
that || ¯En||1 = O(hm+1), and that under the constraint dm = 1 we only obtain
|| ¯En||1 = O(hm).
We know that the collocation error satisﬁes
(Veh)(tn,i) = 0,
i = 1, . . . , m
(0 ≤n ≤N −1).
For n = 0 these equations reduce to
 ci

2.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs
133
(recall also Section 2.4.2), where by assumption, K(t, t) ̸= 0 for t ∈I. Hence,
the linear algebraic system (2.4.24) possesses a unqiue solution ¯E0 whenever
h0 > 0 is sufﬁciently small (cf. (2.4.6) and Theorem 2.4.1). Moreover, since
r0,i = −K(t0, t0)y(m)(t0) ·

this solution satiﬁes || ¯En||1 = O(hm+1

) if, and only if,
 ci

¯Mm(s)ds = 0,
i = 1, . . . , m,
(2.4.25)
is true. It is easily seen that (2.4.25) can only hold if the sets {ci} (deﬁning the
collocation points) and {di} (describing the ‘evaluation points’) interlace, that
is, if
0 < d1 < c1 < d2 < . . . < dm < cm ≤1.
Direct computation, using an elementary property of the Legendre polynomials,
shows that
Qm+1(v) :=
 v
0
Pm(2s −1)ds = const · [Pm+1(2v −1) −Pm−1(2v −1)]
(see also Ghizzetti and Ossicini (1970, pp. 62–63)). The zeros of Qm+1(v) are
the m + 1 Lobatto points in [0, 1] (including 0 and 1). If we denote these points
by
0 =: c0 < c1 < . . . < cm−1 < cm = 1,
(2.4.25) is satisﬁed if we choose
¯Mm(v) = am Pm(2v −1) = 1
m!
m

i=1
(v −di),
with am := 1/(1 · 3 · · · (2m −1)2m). This also shows, by the above interlacing
property, that O(hm+1)-convergence at t = t1 (corresponding to dm = 1) is not
possible.
We leave the extension of the above analysis to the subintervals σn with
1 ≤n ≤N −1 to the reader. It uses as its starting point the equation (2.4.10),
and (for cm = 1) it leads to

2.4.5 Fully discretised collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs
Since we have discussed the fully discretised collocation method for second-
kind VIEs in some detail in Section 2.2.3, we can be brief in dealing with the
analogous discretisations for VIEs of the ﬁrst kind. As before, the integrals in the
collocation equations (2.4.5) and (2.4.19) are approximated by the interpolatory
m-point quadrature formulas corresponding to the local abscissas tn + cihn.
The resulting approximations then coincide with those obtained, in the early
1970s (Weiss (1972a), de Hoog and Weiss (1973a, 1973b), by ‘block-by-block’
methods (see also Brunner (1977, 1978) for the connection with discretised
collocation methods). It is intuitively clear from the perturbation analysis of
Section 2.2.3 that the discretised collocation solution ˆuh will also converge,
provided the collocation parameters satisfy the stability condition (2.4.7) when
ˆuh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), and (2.4.20) for ˆuh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) with 0 < c1 < . . . < cm = 1.
Theorem 2.4.8 Assume that g and K satisfy the assumptions stated in Theorem
2.4.4, and let ˆu(−1)
h
(Ih) be the discretised collocation solution for (2.4.3) that is
based on the interpolatory m-point quadrature formulas introduced in Section
2.2.3. Then the order results of Theorem 2.4.4 remain valid for ˆuh.
An analogous theorem – the discrete counterpart of Theorem 2.4.6 – can be
stated for ˆuh ∈S(0)
m (Ih).
We conclude this discussion with three examples which play a role in many
applications (and which, in Linz’s work of the late 1960s, introduced – and are
still introducing – many numerical analysts and users of computational mathe-
matics to the numerical solution of ﬁrst-kind VIEs). Their proper place within
the general framework of (discretised) collocation, as described above, does,
however, shed more light on their convergence analysis and their numerical
implementation.
Example 2.4.4 ˆuh ∈S(−1)
0
(Ih) (m = 1), 0 < c1 =: θ ≤1:
Consider the fully discretised version of Example 2.4.1 corresponding to θ = 1:
using again interpolatory one-point collocation based on the abscissas tn +
θhn, the discretised collocation solution in this space is determined by ˆyn+1 :=
uh(tn + vhn) (v ∈(0, 1]) and
K(tn+1, tn+1)ˆyn+1 = h−1
n [g(tn+1) −ˆFn(tn+1)],
where
ˆFn(tn+1) =

2.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs
135
Its global order of convergence is p = m = 1; on the set
Yh := {tn+1/2 := tn + hn/2 : n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1}
we have local superconvergence of order p∗= m + 1 = 2,
max
t∈Yh |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Ch2
(see Theorem 2.4.6), a result well known in the classical literature on the nu-
merical analysis of ﬁrst-kind VIEs (see, e.g. Linz (1969b) for a discussion of
the (discrete) midpoint method for ﬁrst-kind VIEs).
Example 2.4.5 ˆuh ∈S(0)
1 (Ih) (m = 1), 0 < c1 =: θ ≤1:
It follows from Example 2.4.3 that the discretised collocation solution in the
space of continuous piecewise linear polynomials is, on ¯σn,
ˆuh(tn + vhn) = 1
θ [(θ −v)ˆyn + vUn,1],
v ∈[0, 1],
with ˆUn,1 being the solution of
1
2 K(tn,1, tn,1) ˆUn,1 = h−1
n [g(tn,1) −ˆFn(tn,1)] −2θ −1
2
K(tn,1, tn)ˆyn.
The corresponding discretised lag term is given by
ˆFn(tn,1) = 1
2
n−1

ℓ=0
hℓ[K(tn,1, tℓ)ˆyℓ+ K(tn,1, tℓ+1)ˆyℓ+1].
For θ = 1 this fully discretised method becomes the discretised (continuous)
trapezoidal method, described by
ˆuh(tn + vhn) = (1 −v)ˆyn + v ˆyn+1,
v ∈[0, 1],
and
1
2 K(tn+1, tn+1)ˆyn+1 = h−1
n [g(tn+1) −ˆFn(tn+1)] −1
2 K(tn+1, tn)ˆyn.
Its order (globally, on I, and locally, on Xh) is p = m + 1 = 2.
2.4.6 Direct versus indirect collocation
We have seen in the previous sections that the collocation solution uh in
S(d)
m+d(Ih) (d ∈{−1, 0}) is in general not locally superconvergent at the points
of the mesh Ih. Thus, if a given ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equation can be
converted into an equation of the second kind, it will be advantageous to use
the latter as the basis for obtaining high-order collocation solutions to (2.4.2)
since the superconvergence results of Section 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 will now apply.

136
2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
It follows under the assumptions of Theorem 2.1.8 that, upon differentiation
with respect to t, the ﬁrst-kind VIE (2.4.2) can be rewritten as
y(t) = g1(t) +
 t
0
K1(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I,
(2.4.26)
with
g1(t) := g′(t)/K(t, t),
K1(t, s) := −(∂K(t, s)/∂t)/K(t, t)
(cf. (2.1.32)), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 for t ∈I. If g1 and K1 are sufﬁciently
regular, then collocation in S(−1)
m−1(Ih) yields local superconvergence of order
p∗= 2m −1 at the mesh points tn (n = 1, . . . , N) when the Radau II points
are chosen as the collocation parameters (Corollary 2.2.8). Note that the amount
of linear algebra required for solving the linear algebraic systems (2.4.5) and
(2.2.14) is the same, and the matrices Im −hn Bn in (2.2.14) are in general
better conditioned than Bn in (2.4.5).
If collocation for (2.4.26) is at the Gauss points, then the iterated colloca-
tion solution for uh yields local superconvergence of order p∗= 2m at these
mesh points with little additional computational cost. We observe again that the
amount of linear algebra remains the same in both approaches.
The indirect collocation approach will be particularly advantageous when
solving nonlinear ﬁrst-kind VIEs, as we shall see in Section 2.4.8.
2.4.7 Adjoint ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equations
We will refer to the VIE
(V∗y)(t) :=
 T
t
K(s, t)y(s)ds = g(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(2.4.27)
as the adjoint equation of (2.4.2).
Let 0 ≤c1 < c2 < . . . < cm < 1 be the collocation parameters underly-
ing the collocation points Xh and the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for
(2.4.27). The collocation equation now reads
(V∗uh)(tn,i) = g(tn,i) i = 1, . . . , m
(n = N −1, N −2, . . . , 0).
Theorem 2.4.9 Assume:
(a) g ∈Cm+1(I), with g(T ) = 0;
(b) K ∈Cm+1(D), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 for t ∈I;
(c) uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is the collocation solution to the adjoint VIE (2.4.27) with
respect to a uniform mesh Ih.

2.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs
137
Then uh converges uniformly to the exact solution y on I,
lim
N→∞||y −uh||∞= 0,
if, and only if, the collocation parameters satisfy the condition
−1 ≤ρ∗
m := (−1)m
m

1 −ci
≤1.
(2.4.28)
We leave the proof (and the statement, analogous to (2.4.8) in Theorem 2.4.2,
on the attainable order of convergence) as an exercise.
Remarks
1. If the collocation parameters are such that c1 = 0, then we have ρ∗
m = 0, and
the collocation solution is convergent for any choice of the remaining ci in
(0, 1).
2. The stability condition (2.4.28) can also be written as
−1 ≤Mm(0)
Mm(1) ≤1
(compare (2.4.7) and (2.4.9)), and we have ρ∗
m = 1/ρm. It is reminiscent of a
similar condition for adjoint collocation methods in ODEs whose collocation
parameters {c∗
i } are given by
c∗
i = 1 −cm+1−i,
i = 1, . . . , m.
For details, see Section V.2.1 in Hairer, Lubich and Wanner (2002).
2.4.8 Nonlinear ﬁrst-kind VIEs
Although nonlinear ﬁrst-kind VIEs,
 t
0
k(t, s, y(s))ds = g(t),
t ∈I,
can in principle be solved by ‘direct’ collocation in S(−1)
m−1(Ih), it is often ad-
vantageous – as we have already brieﬂy indicated in Section 2.4.6 – to use
a somewhat different, ‘indirect’ approach. We will illustrate by considering
nonlinear equations of Hammerstein type, namely,
(Hy)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds = g(t),
t ∈I,
(2.4.29)
with g(0) = 0 and appropriately differentiable K and G.

138
2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
The basis of this approach is the differentiated form of (2.4.29): it is an
implicit VIE of the second kind, again of Hammerstein type,
G(t, y(t)) = g1(t) +
 t
0
K1(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds,
t ∈I,
(2.4.30)
with g1 and K1 as in (2.4.26). We assume again that |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 on I. In
analogy to Section 2.3.3 we rewrite this equation, by setting z(t) := (N y)(t) =
G(t, y(t)), as
z(t) = g1(t) +
 t
0
K1(t, s)z(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(2.4.31)
If its solution z is known, the solution y of the original VIE can be found by
solving the nonlinear operator equation
(N y)(t) = G(t, y(t)) = z(t),
t ∈I
(2.4.32)
for y in C(I). In the collocation framework the problem becomes: ﬁnd the collo-
cation solution zh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) satisfying the collocation equation corresponding
to (2.4.31),
zh(t) = g1(t) +
 t
0
K1(t, s)zh(s)ds,
t ∈Xh,
(2.4.33)
and then deﬁne the iterated collocation solution zit
h by
zit
h (t) := g1(t) +
 t
0
K1(t, s)zh(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(2.4.34)
For any given t ∈I the approximation yh(t) to the exact solution y(t) is obtained
by solving the nonlinear equation
(N yh)(t) = G(t, yh(t)) = zit
h (t).
(2.4.35)
Under suitable conditions guaranteeing the invertibility of the Niemytzki op-
erator on C(I) we obtain a unique approximation yh ∈C(I) to the solution of
the ﬁrst-kind Volterra-Hammerstein equation (2.4.29).
2.4.9 Collocation in smoother piecewise polynomial spaces
Hung (1970) showed that the collocation solution uh ∈S(1)
2 (Ih) to the ﬁrst-kind
VIE (2.4.1) is divergent when c1 = 1. From what we have seen in Section 1.3.1
(Theorem 1.3.1) and Section 2.2.15 this result is perhaps not entirely surprising.
However, the general ‘M¨ulthei theory’ on the divergence and convergence of
smooth piecewise polynomial collocation solutions for Volterra integral equa-
tions of the ﬁrst kind has not yet been established.

2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
The name ‘integral equation’ appears to be due to Du Bois-Reymond (1888):
in his paper on elliptic partial differential equations he says that ‘Ich schrieb
diese Gleichungen nicht hin, als ob sie etwa das Problem l¨osten oder doch der
L¨osung n¨aher f¨uhrten, sie sollen nur ein Beispiel unter zahllosen sein, daf¨ur,
dass man bei Randwertproblemen der linearen partiellen Differentialgleichun-
gen best¨andig vor dieselbe Gattung von Aufgaben gestellt wird, welche je-
doch, wie es scheint, f¨ur die heutige Analysis im Allgemeinen un¨uberwindliche
Schwierigkeiten darbieten. Ich meine die zweckm¨assig Integralgleichungen zu
nennenden Aufgaben, welche darin bestehen, dass die zu bestimmende Func-
tion, ausser ihrem sonstigen Vorkommen, in ihnen unter bestimmten Integralen
enthalten ist,. . . ’ (‘I write down these equations not as if they solve the problem
or even carry it nearer to a solution; they serve only as examples of the fact
that in the boundary value problem of linear partial differential equations one is
continually faced by this type of problem which still, for the analysis of today,
presents in general insurmountable difﬁculties. I propose to give to these very
useful problems the name integral equations . . . ’.) An English translation of
most of this can be found in Davis (1926, p. 10). These ‘insurmountable dif-
ﬁculties’ were of course dealt with by Ivar Fredholm some twelve years later
(see his main paper of 1903).
Picard introduced the iteration technique that now bears his name in his
m´emoire of 1890. Some of the results by Le Roux (1895) predate the ones by
Volterra (1896a); however, his convergence analysis for the Neumann series
was based on a geometric series and hence valid only under the condition that
¯K T < 1.
The paper by Lauricella (1908) gives a survey of the early developments of
the theory of integral equations with variable upper limits of integration. While
such integral equations were already considered by Liouville in the late 1830s
(see, e.g. Dieudonn´e (1981)), the name ‘Volterra integral equation’ appears to
have been coined by Lalesco (1908, p. 126), following a suggestion by his
teacher, E. Picard.
Bˆocher(1909,2ndedn:1913)wastheﬁrstmonographdedicatedtothetheory
of integral equations. Its publication was followed by the report by Bateman
(1910) on the state of the art in their theory. (It is interesting to compare this
account with the report by Walther and Dejon (1960), published 50 years later.)
The following books contain large sections on Volterra integral equations:
Lalesco (1912) (pp. 5–18: Volterra theory, including V1s in IR2; systems of
V2s; nonlinear V2s (pp. 127–130); (V 1)α (pp. 103–111); chronological bib-
liography (≤1911), Volterra (1913) (based on lectures given in Rome during
1909–1910: Volterra theory (pp. 34–101); ‘ﬁnite to inﬁnite’ (corresponding

Kowalewski (1930). See also Schmeidler (1950), Pogorzelski (1966), Cochran
(1972), and Zabreyko et al. (1975). Mingarelli (1983) analyses VIEs of Stieltjes
type.
The papers by Klebanov and Sleeman (1996) and V¨ath (1998a, 1998b),
and the book by V¨ath (1999) beautifully complement the above expositions of
Volterra theory: they respectively introduce an axiomatic theory of VIEs and
study abstract VIEs by means of topological and algebraic methods (V¨ath).
Because of practical implications, we also mention a number of contributions
to the problem of deriving optimal estimates for the norm of the nth power of
a linear Volterra operator (usually with K(t, s) ≡1); they are Halmos (1982,
Chapter 20), Lao and Whitley (1997), Thorpe (1998), Little and Read (1998),
and Kershaw (1999).
The detailed study of nonlinear Volterra integral equations of the second
kind has its origin in the early 1950s, in the papers by Sato (1951, 1953), Mann
and Wolf (1951), and Roberts and Mann (1951); see also Padmavally (1958).
A detailed survey (including a comprehensive list of references) of the early
developments of this theory can be found in Nohel (1964), Wouk (1964), and
Nohel (1976). See also v. Wolfersdorf (2000). Miller (2000) describes the
important role the group at the University of Wisconsin at Madison played in
this.
The classical book on nonlinear VIEs is the one by Miller (1971a); see also
Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990) and Corduneanu (1991) (this book
starts with an excellent overview of the many contributions to the subject).
The reader may wish to look at the paper by Diekmann and Gils (1981) for
a variation-of-constants formula for nonlinear VIEs with convolution kernels;
see also Brauer (1972). We also mention Diekmann and van Gils (1984) for an
illuminating discussion of invariant manifolds.
The existence and uniqueness of solutions to nonlinear VFIEs is studied in,
e.g. Pachpatte (1986) and Zaghrout (1993).
Theoretical aspects of the Goursat problem are discussed in Dzyadyk (1995)
(Section 5.3.1); see also Kowalewski (1930), Goursat (1942), and T¨ornig
(1959), Moore (1961), Filippi and Stimberg (1968), and Dobner (1987) for
additional references and numerical approaches to the problem.
The books by Bellman and Cooke (1963), Lakshmikantham and Leela
(1969), Miller (1971a), Cochran (1972), Mitrinovi´c, Peˇcari´c and Fink (1991),
and Bainov and Simeonov (1992) contain much material on Gronwall type in-
equalities and comparison theorems for Volterra equations; see also the papers
by Beesack (1969, 1985b), Agarwal and Thandapani (1981), and Dixon and
McKee (1984).
The ﬁrst result on a discrete Gronwall inequality appears to occur in Mike-
ladze (1935, p. 259); more recent results can be found in, e.g. Jones (1964),

(1986), and Brunner and van der Houwen (1986), Ch. 1.
Due to limitation of space we have not mentioned the qualitative theory
of VIEs (and VIDEs), which may be said to have its origin in the celebrated
results by Paley and Wiener (1934) (see also Exercise 3.5.3). The monograph
by Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990) should be consulted for a thorough
exposition of this theorem (see pp. 45–63 and pp. 83–89). However, see also
Nohel (1964, 1976), Tsalyuk (1969), Shea and Wainger (1975), and the survey
paper by Tsalyuk (1979).
Linear and nonlinear VIEs with periodic solutions are studied in Friedman
(1965); see also Miller (1971a) and Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990).
Applications of VIEs:
The following books and survey papers contain sections dealing with various
applications of Volterra integral equations in the physical and biological sci-
ences: Schmeidler (1950), Bellman and Cooke (1963), Anselone (1964), Miller
(1971a), Brunner (1982a), Burton (1983), Webb (1985), Okrasi´nski (1989),
Corduneanu (1991), Guy and Sal`es (1991), Pr¨uss (1993), Agarwal and O’Regan
(2000), and Corduneanu and Sandberg (2000), Zhao (2003). Most of these also
include extensive lists of references.
The following is a selection of papers dealing with speciﬁc applications of
VIEs of the second kind:
r Population dynamics, spread of epidemics: Brauer (1975, 1976a), Diekmann
(1978, 1979), Thieme (1977, 1979), Gripenberg (1981) (‘non-standard’ VIE),
Brauer and Castillo-Ch´avez (2001) (see also for additional references).
r Renewal equation: Feller (1941), Karlin (1955), Bellman and Cooke (1963)
(Chapters 7 and 8), Brauer (1976b).

wave analysis in nonlinear reaction-convection-diffusion problems), mono-
graph by Kabanikhin and Lorenzi (1999) (identiﬁcation problems for wave
phenomena), Franco (1999) (nonlinear waves).
r Water percolation: Okrasi´nski (1978).
r Semi-conductor devices: Miller and Unterreiter (1992), Schmeiseer, Unter-
reiter and Weiss (1993), Unterreiter (1996) (models for switching behaviour
of PN-diodes).

Volterra (operator) integral equations arising in such problems and their reg-
ularisation is given in the book by Kabanikhin and Lorenzi. (See also the
Notes to Chapters 3 and 6 on additional, related work by Lorenzi and his
co-workers.)

r Identiﬁcation of memory kernels in viscoelasticity and heat conduction: This
problem was studied extensively by v. Wolfersdorf (1994), Unger and v.
Wolfersdorf (1995), Janno and v. Wolfersdorf (1997a,b), Kiss (1999 / doc-
toral thesis). See also Berrone (1995) on the modelling of materials that may
undergo a change of phase.
r Viscoelasticity (partial VIEs): Shaw, Warby and Whiteman (1994, 1996,
1997), Shaw and Whiteman (1997).
Applications of ﬁrst-kind VIEs with bounded kernels:
Volterra’s Nota I of 1896 may have been motivated by a ﬁrst-kind integral
equation he encountered in a problem in electrostatics (Volterra (1884)). A
selection of more recent sources of applications of such functional equations
is given below.
r The books by Sneddon (1972), Asanov (1998) and Bukhgeim (1999) contain
numerous sources of applications of ﬁrst-kind VIEs.
r Inverse problems in heat conduction: Beck, Backwell and St. Clair (1985),
Eld´en (1976), Lamm (2000 / survey paper with comprehensive list of refer-
ences), Lamm and Scoﬁeld (2000).

tions.

2.2: Collocation for second-kind VIEs
In his book of 1913 (pp. 40–46) Volterra used a discretised version of the lin-
ear second-kind VIE to establish the existence of a unqiue continuous solution
for the latter. The underlying quadrature formula is based on the left rectangu-
lar rule, and the resulting discrete version version of the VIE may be viewed
as discretised collocation in S(−1)
0
(Ih), with c1 = 1. The idea of employing
collocation-type approximations in S(0)
1 (Ih) for the numerical solution of VIEs
is due to Huber (1939); his aproach was extended by Wagner (1954). See also
the paper by Kaspˇsickaja (1969) where special polynomial collocation spaces
are used.
The books by Baker (1977), Linz (1985), and Brunner and van der Houwen
(1986) contain a wealth of information (and extensive bibliographies) on the
numerical treatment of Volterra integral equations. See also the survey papers
by Bernier (1945), Noble (1964, 1977), Baker (1982, 1997, 2000), Brunner
(1982a, 1987, 1999b).
The papers by Brunner (1984c, 1986b) review the historical development of
numerical methods – particularly collocation methods – for second-kind VIEs.
In Section 2.2.6 we analysed the error uh −ˆuh that results when the ex-
act collocation equation is replaced by its fully discretised counterpart. If

148
2 Volterra integral equations with smooth kernels
the kernel of the Volterra integral operator V is highly oscillatory, K(t, s) =
exp(iω(t −s))H(t, s), with ω ≫1, this analysis will be misleading when h > 0
is ﬁxed: interpolatory quadrature based on the collocation points will in general
introduce large errors depending on ω. A powerful alternative to such classical
quadrature formulas is described in Iserles (2004); it employs an elegant vari-
ant of Filon-type quadrature. The application to the derivation of feasible fully
discretised collocation equations remains to be investigated.
As we already indicated in the Preface, an attractive alternative to piecewise
polynomial collocation methods is given by pseudo-spectral methods. Of the
papers dealing with these methods we mention the ones by Elnagar and Kazemi-
Dekhordi (1996) and Elnagar and Razzaghi (1996) on Volterra–Hammerstein
equations; see also their references.
An early contribution to the numerical analysis of (nonlinear) two-
dimensional VIEs of the second kind is by Bel’tyukov and Kuznechikhina
(1976): they design and analyse a class of Runge–Kutta methods (extending
Bel’tyukov’s method of 1965; see Brunner and van der Houwen (1986, Chapter
4)). See also the papers by Singh (1976) and Mure¸san (1984). The paper by
Schaback (1974) contains may pertinent remarks on multi-dimensional spline
collocation.
More recent papers on such VIEs are by, e.g. Brunner and Kauthen (1989),
G. Han and Zhang (1994a), Luo and Hu (1995), G. Han et al. (2000), and G. Han
and Wang (2001).
Second-kind integral equations of (‘mixed’) Volterra–Fredholm type arise
for example in the modelling of the spread of epidemics (cf. Thieme (1977,
1979), Diekmann (1978), Pachpatte (1986), and Brunner (1990) for addi-
tional references). The numerical treatment of such functional equations has
been studied by many authors; see, e.g. Ha¸cia (1979, 1996, 1999), Kauthen
(1989a, 1989b), Brunner (1990, 1991), Han and Zhang (1994b), Han (1995),
and Hadizadeh (2003).
Divergence of classical (full-continuity) cubic spline collocation solution:
convergent variants given by Hung (1970), Netravali (1973) and by Oja and
Saveljeva (2001); in latter paper: one of the initial conditions is replaced by a
right-hand boundary condition. The analysis for the collocation spaces S(d)
m+d(Ih)
given by Danciu (1995) is, as pointed out in MR 99g:65125a and in Oja (2001a,
2002b), unfortunately ﬂawed.
Fredholm integral equations of the second kind: Nystr¨om’s paper on the
numerical solution of Fredholm integral equations dates from 1928. Kadner
(1960, 1967) initiated the interest in collocation methods for second-kind FIEs
(see also Dejon (1962) on the choice of the collocation points). One of the
subsequent key papers is the one by Sloan (1976) in which the notion of the
iterated collocation (and Galerkin) solution is introduced; compare also Sloan

2.6 Notes
149
(1984) (variants of the Galerkin method) and Schock (1985) (analysis of pos-
sible rates of convergence). Surveys of superconvergence results for FIEs can
be found in Chatelin and Lebbar (1981), the monograph by Chatelin (1983), in
Brunner (1987), and in Sloan (1988a, 1990). The reader should also consult the
papers by Joe (1985a, 1985b) on exact and discretised collocation methods, and
their optimal convergence estimates. Similar analyses, especially for nonlinear
FIEs, can be found in Atkinson and Bogomolny (1987) (Galerkin methods) and
Atkinson and Flores (1993) (collocation methods). See also the survey paper
of Atkinson (1992).
The paper by Graham, Joe and Sloan (1985) gives an illuminating com-
parison (with respect to regularity requirements and attainable orders of con-
vergence) of iterated Galerkin methods with iterated collocation methods for
second-kind Fredholm integral equations. See also Sloan (1990, pp. 63–64) for
a concise survey of these results. It would be of considerable interest to carry
out a similar study for Volterra integral equations.
TheauthoritativebookonthenumericalanalysisofFIEsisAtkinson(1997a);
it contains extensive sections on piecewise polynomial collocation solutions.
2.3: Collocation for nonlinear second-kind VIEs
A general analysis of fully discretised collocation methods can be found in
Brunner (1992a). Implicitly linear collocation methods are analysed in Brunner
(1992b); see also Brunner (1991).
2.4: Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs
Many of the common numerical methods described in, e.g. Linz (1969b),
Weiss (1972a), de Hoog and Weiss (1973b, 1973c) and McAlevey (1987) can
be interpreted as fully discretised collocation methods in S(−1)
m−1(Ih) or S(0)
m (Ih);
see Brunner (1977) and Brunner and van der Houwen (1986, Chapter 5).
The diploma theses of Rothe (1982) and Ries (1988) analyse various aspects
of piecewise poynomial collocation methods for VIEs of the ﬁrst kind with
smooth kernels.
The numerical solution of two-dimensional VIEs of the ﬁrst kind by block
methods was studied by Ten Men Yan (1979): it corresponds to discre-
tised collocation in S(−1)
0,0 (h,k) with c1 = d1 = 1 and leads (as in the one-
dimensional case) to local superconvergence of order O(h2) at the midpoints
points x j+1/2, yl+1/2 of a uniform mesh.
We have already mentioned (end of Section 2.1.4) the sequential regularisa-
tion approaches by Lamm et al. (see e.g. the surveys by Lamm (2000, 2003);
also Ring (2001)): some of these methods are based on collocation techniques.
Plato and Vainikko (1990) study the regularisation of general projection meth-
ods. A different approach to regularisation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs is discussed in
Brunner and Sizikov (1998).

Volterra integro-differential equations
with smooth kernels
In 1909 Volterra wrote (following the study of the modelling of hysteresis prob-
lems) that one is led ‘. . . ad equazioni che hanno tipo misto, cio´e in parte quello
delle equazioni differenziali a derivate parziale ed in parte quello delle equazioni
integrali. Mi permetto perci`o di chiamarle equazioni integro-differenziali.’ He
then used such ‘equations of mixed type’, namely linear integro-differential
equations involving Volterra integral operators, as models describing heredity
effects (see Volterra (1913, pp. 138–162)). Related, but more general (non-
linear) versions became famous in Volterra’s work, starting around 1926, on
the growth of single-species or interacting populations. At the end of his 1909
paper (p. 174) he added, however, a cautionary note when he observed that ‘. . . il
problema della risoluzione delle equazioni integro-differenziali costituisce in
generale un problema essenzialmente distinto dai problemi delle equazioni dif-
ferenziali e da quelli ordinarii delle equazioni integrali’ [his italics].
Although such functional equations may be viewed formally as ODEs per-
turbed by a ‘memory’ term given by a Volterra integral operator, the analysis of
collocation methods will be more complex (perhaps not ‘essentially distinct’ –
except when it comes to the analysis of qualitative properties) than simply a
synthesis of the techniques employed in Chapters 1 and 2. The convergence
results we establish in this chapter will of course yield those of Chapter 1 as
special cases.

and Zhang (1998) (see also for additonal references). The reader should also
consult the important paper by Graham, Joe and Sloan (1985) in which the
relative merits of Galerkin and collocation methods for second-kind Fredholm
integral equations are studied. An analogous comparison of these methods for
second-kind VIEs would be valuable, too.
An important topic for future research relates to a posteriori error estimates
for (iterated) collocation solutions and adaptive mesh selection. There are now
a number of papers in which this problem has been studied for (continuous
and discontinuous) Galerkin methods: we cite especially Shaw and Whiteman
(1996a, 1997, 2000a, 2001b, 2001).
Postprocessing methods
There is an extensive literature on methods aimed at improving the accu-
racy/order of a computed numerical (quadrature, collocation, or Galerkin) so-
lution to a VIE (or a Fredholm integral equation). Hock (1979, 1980, 1981)
studied extrapolation techniques based on simple quadrature methods (which
can be interpreted as discretised collocation methods). The research work of
Lin Qun (Chinese Academy of Sciences) from the late 1970s onwards was the
starting point for many more recent papers. A detailed treatment of the mathe-
matical framework and their computational applications of such postprocessing
methods would easily ﬁll a separate monograph. (The monograph by Marchuk
and Shaidurov (1983) deals with extrapolation methods for VIEs of the ﬁrst
and second kind.)
Extrapolation techniques applied to simple quadrature methods for second-
kind VIEs were suggested by Noble (1964) and, especially, by Hock (1979,
1980, 1981). Of the numerous papers on iterative correction and multilevel
correction techniques we mention the ones by Lin and L¨u (1984), Lin, Sloan
and Xie (1990), Xiang (1991), Lin and Shi (1993), Han (1993, 1994a, 1994b,
1994c), Han and Zhang (1994a, 1995), Han (1995) (for VFIEs), Luo and Hu
(1995), Brunner, Lin and Yan (1996), Zhou (1997), Lin and Zhou (1997a,
1997b), Lin, Zhang and Yan (1998a,b), Hu (1998a), Brunner, Y. Lin and Zhang
(1998), Zhang, Y. Lin and Rao (2000), Luo (2000), Han et al. (2000), Han and
Wang (2001).
Extrapolation methods for ﬁrst-kind VIEs were studied by Linz (1969b),
Hung (1970) (for collocation in S(0)
1 )(Ih)), Eggermont (1985, 1986) (for collo-
cation solutions), and McAlevey (1987). Zhou (1991) presents a detailed anal-
ysis of extrapolation methods for collocation solutions (see also Zhou (1997)
for multiparameter error resolution techniques).

and where a, g ∈C(I), K ∈C(D) are given (real-valued) functions. It is clear
from the analysis presented in Section 2.1.1 that the result on the existence
and uniqueness of a solution to (3.1.1) can readily be obtained by rewriting the
above initial-value problem (which generalizes the initial-value problem for a
linear ODE) as a second-kind Volterra integral equation,

notion of the (differential) resolvent kernel associated with the given functions
a and K (which describe the homogeneous part of the VIDE in (3.1.1)) and to
derive the corresponding resolvent equations. We ﬁrst state
Theorem 3.1.1 Assume that a, g ∈C(I) and K ∈C(D). Then for any initial
value y0 ∈IR the VIDE (3.1.1) possesses a unique solution y ∈C1(I) satisfying
y(0) = y0. Moreover, there exists a unique functionr = r(t, s), the (differential)
resolvent kernel, with r ∈C1(D), so that this solution can be written as
y(t) = r(t, 0)y0 +

Q(t, v)dv,
(t, s) ∈D;
(3.1.7)
its uniqueness, and hence that of y, follow from the uniqueness of the resolvent
kernel Q and from Theorem 2.1.2. Note that r ∈C(D), with ∂r(t, s)/∂s =
−Q(t, s) ∈C(D), and we have r(t, t) = 1 for all t ∈I. This completes the
proof.
These observations reveal that the resolvent r(t, s) associated with the linear

(3.1.8)
The resolvent kernel r(t, s) can also be deﬁned by the (unique) solution of an
adjoint resolvent equation, in complete analogy to the situation for second-kind
VIEs. We summarise this result in the following theorem.
Theorem 3.1.2 Assume that a ∈C(I) and K ∈C(D). Then the resolvent ker-
nel r = r(t, s) of the linear VIDE (3.1.1) is the (unique) solution of the resolvent
equation (3.1.8), corresponding tor(t, t) = 1 for t ∈I. It also solves the adjoint
resolvent equation,

= r(t, s)a(t) +
 t
s
K(t, v)r(v, s)dv,
(t, s) ∈D,
(3.1.9)
with r(s, s) = 1 for s ∈I.
We leave it to the reader to prove the second part of Theorem 3.1.2 (see Exercise
3.5.1).
Corollary 3.1.3 The resolvent equations associated with the special VIDE

with r(t, t) = 1 (t ∈I) and r(s, s) = 1 (s ∈I), respectively. If K(t, s) = k(t −
s) then the resolvent r inherits the convolution structure of the kernel.
The next theorem, the counterpart of Theorem 2.1.3, deals with the regularity
of the solution to the linear VIDE (3.1.1).
Theorem 3.1.4 Assume that a, g ∈Cm(I) and K ∈Cm(D). Then for any y0
the solution y of the linear VIDE (3.1.1) lies in the space Cm+1(I).
Proof This regularity result can be proved either by applying Theorem 2.1.3
to the second-kind VIE (3.1.2) (with m + 1 replacing m, due to the additional
regularity in g0 and H), or by showing that the resolvent r lies in Cm+1(D) and
using this fact in the representation (3.1.4). Details are left to the reader.
In Section 3.1.3 we shall describe analogous results for various nonlinear
counterparts of the VIDE (3.1.1), including the generic nonlinear VIDE
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)) +
 t

Here, r(t, s) denotes the resolvent kernel associated with a and K describing
the linear part of (3.1.11).
Proof Setting Q(t) := g(t) + (Hy)(t), the semilinear VIDE (3.1.11) becomes
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + Q(t) + (Vy)(t),
t ∈I.
According to Theorem 3.1.1 the solution of this ‘linear’ VIDE is formally given
by
y(t) = r(t, 0)y0 +
 t

3.1.2 Neutral and higher-order VIDEs
If the kernel k = k(t, s, y) in the VIDE (3.1.10) also depends on y′, that is, if
the VIDE has the form
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)) +
 t

k(t, s, y(s), y′(s))ds,
t ∈I,
(3.1.13)
then such a functional equation is often (but not quite properly) referred to as a
neutral (ﬁrst-order) VIDE. It is a particular case of the kth-order VIDE (3.1.14)
we shall study below. In Chapters 4 and 8 we shall meet another class of neutral
(delay) VIDEs for which

Let now k ≥2 be a given integer and consider the initial-value problem for
the general (nonlinear) neutral VIDE,
y(k)(t) = f (t, y(t), y′(t), . . . , y(k−1)(t)) + (Vy)(t),
t ∈I,

where we now deﬁne

k(t, s, y(s), y′(s), . . . , y(k)(s))ds.

with continuous functions g, aν and Kν, to render the subsequent convergence
analysis more transparent. Note that we allow the derivative of order k of y
to occur as argument in the kernel of the VIDE, thus generalising the neutral
VIDE (3.1.13).
We shall now show brieﬂy that, under the above continuity assumptions,
the linear VIDE possesses a unique solution y ∈Ck(I) which assumes the
prescribed initial values. An analogous (generally only local) existence and
uniqueness result can be obtained for the nonlinear VIDE (3.1.10), by suitably
adapting the arguments presented below.
Let w(t) := (w0(t), w1(t), . . . , wk(t))T:= (y(t), y′(t), . . . , y(k)(t))T∈IRk+1:

(3.1.20)

R(t, s) :=

. . .
R0,k(t, s)

Rk,0(t, s)

,
then the representation (3.1.20) permits the explicit derivation of the expressions
for the k + 1 components, e.g. for w0(t) = y(t), of the solution vector w(t).
The above equivalence between the initial-value problem for the kth-order
neutral VIDE given by (3.1.14)–(3.1.16), and the system of k + 1 linear Volterra
integral equations (3.1.19) allows us, by appealing to Theorem 2.1.7, to obtain
the following regularity result.
Theorem 3.1.6 Assume that aν (ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1) and g are in C(I),
and Kν ∈C(D) (ν = 0, 1, . . . , k). Then for any initial values y(ν)
0
(ν =
0, 1, . . . , k −1) the linear kth-order VIDE (3.1.14) corresponding to (3.1.15),
(3.1.16) possesses a unique solution y ∈Ck(I) satisfying the given initial con-
ditions.
If the given functions have continuous derivatives of order m on their re-
spective domains I and D, then the solution y lies in the space Ck+m(I).
We will return to this result, and the equivalence property underlying it, in
Section 3.2.6 when we analyse the attainable order of global and local super-
convergence of the collocation solution in S(d)
m+d(Ih) (d = k −1) for (3.1.14).

We observe that in certain applications, in particular in the spatial semidis-

Zhang (1989), Zhang (1990), Kauthen (1989b, 1992), Larsson, Thom´ee and
Wahlbin (1998), Lin (1998), and Chen and Shih (1998), as well as the the refer-
ences in Brunner (1989b)), nonlinear VIDEs typically have a more structured
form. A representative example is
y′(t) = f (y(t)) + (Hy)(t),

(3.1.22)
(compare also the end of Section 3.1.1), where H denotes the Hammerstein
operator introduced before,

3.1 Review of basic Volterra theory (II)

Results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to initial-value prob-
lems for higher-order (neutral) VIDEs of the form (3.1.14) can be proved by
rewriting the VIDE as a system of k + 1 nonlinear second-kind VIEs, analogous
to (3.1.19).
Other mathematical modelling processes (we mention those in population
growth and viscoelasticity as two important examples; cf. Volterra (1927, 1928,
1931, 1959), Cushing (1977), Lodge, McLeod and Nohel (1978), Markowich
and Renardy (1983), and the Notes at the end of the chapter) lead to more
general, non-standard VIDEs in which the integrand depends both on y(s) and
y(t). A typical generic form is given by
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)) +
 t
0
k(t −s)G(y(t), y(s))ds,
(3.1.25)
and the best known example is probably the logistic equation with memory
term,

ε −ay(t) −
 t

k(t −s)y(s)ds

y(t),
t ≥0,
(3.1.26)
which corresponds to f (t, y) = f (y) = (ε −ay)y and G(y, z) = −yz (see, for
example, Volterra’s papers of 1928 and 1934); an existence result can be found
in Miller (1966)). The memory kernel k is usually of the form
k(t) = (γ0b−1 + γ1b−2t) exp(−t/b),
with γ1 > γ0 ≥0, γ0 + γ1 = 1, and b > 0 (see also Cushing (1977) and Aves,
Davies and Higham (1996, 2000)).
The dynamics of two interacting species was ﬁrst modelled by Volterra
(1927) (and preocccupied him until his death in 1940 – see Volterra (1939)):
if we denote by N1(t) and N2(t) the size of the two populations at time t ≥0,
then the resulting system of non-standard VIDEs has the form

Here, the εi and ai denote given positive constants, and the lower limit of in-
tegration is either θ = 0, θ = −∞, or θ = θ(t) = t −τ (τ > 0) (VIDEs with
constant and variable delays τ > 0 will be discussed in Chapter 4). In his 1927
paper Volterra presents a detailed analysis of the quantitative and qualitative
properties of the solutions to the above system of VIDEs.

3.2 Collocation for linear VIDEs
3.2.1 The exact collocation equations
Consider the ﬁrst-order Volterra integro-differential equation
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)) + (Vy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(3.2.1)
with initial condition y(0) = y0. The operator V : C(I) →C(I) for now de-
notes again the linear Volterra integral operator deﬁned by
(Vφ)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)φ(s)ds,
t ∈I,
where K ∈C(D). Since the VIDE (3.2.1) can be viewed as being a ‘pertur-
bation’ of the ODE (1.1.1), with perturbation term given by the memory term
(Vy)(t), it will be interesting to see how this perturbation affects the order results
we derived for ODEs, and how the usually necessary quadrature approximations
for the memory term inﬂuence these results for the exact collocation equation.
Here, the insights we obtained in Chapter 2 will of course be helpful.
As in the case of ODEs we approximate the solution y by collocation in the
piecewise polynomial space S(0)
m (I): the collocation solution uh is the element
in this space that satisﬁes the collocation equation
u′
h(t) = f (t, uh(t)) + (Vuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(3.2.2)
together with the initial condition uh(0) = y(0) = y0. Since the dimension of
thiscollocationspaceisdim S(0)
m (Ih) = Nm + 1,theset Xh ofcollocationpoints
will be as in Sections 1.1.1 and 2.2.1, namely,
Xh := {tn,i := tn + cihn : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}.
If we admit sets Xh with c1 = 0 and cm = 1 (m ≥2), then the collocation
solution lies again in the smoother space S(0)
m (Ih) ∩C1(I) =: S(1)
m (Ih), provided
the given functions in (3.2.1) are continuous. Its dimension is dim S(1)
m (Ih) =
N(m −1) + 2, implying that we need a second (‘artiﬁcial’) initial condition,
u′
h(0) = y′(0) = f (0, y0), in order to start the recursive process for solving
(3.2.2).
We have already encountered the local (Lagrange) representation of uh ∈
S(0)
m (Ih) on ¯σn in Section 1.1.1: setting Yn, j := u′

3.2 Collocation for linear VIDEs
163
When the solution Yn of (3.2.9) has been found, the collocation solution on the
interval ¯σn is determined by
uh(tn + vhn) = yn + hnββT (v)Yn,
v ∈[0, 1],
(3.2.10)
where ββ(v) := (β1(v), . . . , βm(v))T ∈IRm.
Theorem 3.2.1 Assume that the functions a, g and K in the VIDE (3.2.1),
with f given by (3.2.5), are continuous on their respective domains I and D.
Then there exists an ¯h > 0 so that for any mesh Ih with mesh diameter h > 0
satisfying h < ¯h, each of the linear algebraic systems (3.2.9) has a unique
solution Yn ∈IRm. Hence the collocation equation (3.2.2) deﬁnes a unique
collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for the initial-value problem (3.2.1), (3.2.5),
and its representation on the subinterval ¯σn is given by (3.2.10).
Proof It follows from the assumptions on a and K that the matrices
Cn := An + hnCn ∈L(IRm) (0 ≤n ≤N −1)
have bounded elements for any mesh Ih. Thus, the argument in the proof of
Theorem 2.2.1 can again be used to deduce that the inverses (Im −hnCn)−1
exist and are bounded whenever hn ∈(0, ¯h), for some sufﬁciently small ¯h >
0, implying that each of the systems (Im −hnCn)Yn = gn + Gn + κκnyn is
uniquely solvable in IRm when h = max(n) hn < ¯h. This proves Theorem 3.2.1.
For V = 0 (i.e. Cn = 0 for all n) we obtain the uniqueness of the collocation
solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for ODEs.
Example 3.2.1 uh ∈S(0)
1 (Ih) (m = 1),
0 < c1 =: θ ≤1, tn,1 = tn + θhn:
Here we have, as in Example 1.1.1, β1(v) = v, A = a1,1 = θ, and
uh(tn + vhn) = (1 −v)yn + vyn+1,
v ∈[0, 1],
yn = uh(tn)
(3.2.11)
(since uh(tn + vhn) = yn + vhnYn,1 yields, for v = 1, hnYn,1 = yn+1 −yn). It
thus follows from (3.2.6) that yn+1 is given by the solution of the linear algebraic
equation

3.2.2 The fully discretised collocation equations
The (exact) collocation equation (3.2.6) for the linear VIDE (3.2.1),(3.2.5) can
only be used for the numerical computation of uh if the integrals in the equation

3.2 Collocation for linear VIDEs

(and the lag term (3.2.7)) can be found analytically. Since this will in general
not be possible (compare, however, Section 3.3) these integrals will have to be
approximated by feasible numerical quadrature processes which, as in Section
2.2.1, will be given, or are based on, interpolatory m-point quadrature formulas
whose abscissas are determined by the collocation parameters {ci}. Hence,
using the notation introduced in (2.2.19), (2.2.20), the fully discretised version

3.2 Collocation for linear VIDEs
167
Theorem 3.2.2 Assume that the given functions a, g and K in the linear VIDE
(3.2.1), (3.2.5) satisfy the conditions of Theorem 3.2.1. If the exact collocation
equation (3.2.6) is discretised by interpolatory m-point quadrature formulas
based on the collocation parameters {ci} and given by (3.2.16) and (3.2.17),
then there exists an ˆh > 0 so that for any mesh Ih with mesh diameter h ∈(0, ˆh),
each of the linear systems (3.2.19) has a unique solution ˆYn ∈IRm. Hence the
discretised collocation equation (3.2.14) deﬁnes a unique collocation solution
ˆuh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) which on ¯σn is given by (3.2.22).
The proof is a straightforward adaptation of the proof for Theorem 3.2.1: for
ﬁxed m ≥1 the weights of the above interpolatory m-point quadrature formulas
are bounded for all h > 0, and hence, by the assumed continuity of a and K,
the matrices ˆCn ∈L(IRm) have bounded elements for any hn. This implies
that the inverses of the matrices characterising the systems (3.2.18), ˆCn :=
Im −hn(An + hn ˆCn) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1), exist and are uniformly bounded
for hn ∈(0, ˆh) for some ˆh > 0 which will in general be different from ¯h deﬁned
in Theorem 3.2.1.
Example 3.2.3 m = 1 (discretised θ-method): It follows from Example 3.2.1
that this method is given by
ˆuh(tn + vhn) = ˆyn + (1 −v)ˆyn + v ˆyn+1,
v ∈[0, 1],
and
[1 −θhna(tn,1) −θ3h2

3.2.3 Global convergence results
We start by deriving global error estimates for the collocation solution uh ∈
S(0)
m (Ih) to the linear VIDE
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + g(t) + (Vy)(t),
t ∈I,
y(0) = y0,
(3.2.23)
where
(Vy)(t) :=
 t

K(t, s)y(s)ds.
Theorem 3.2.3 Assume:
(a) The given functions in (3.2.23) satisfy a, g ∈Cm(I), K ∈Cm(D).
(b) uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the collocation solution to (3.2.23) deﬁned by (3.2.3),
(3.2.4) with h ∈(0, ¯h).
Then the estimates
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cν||y(m+1)||∞hm
(ν = 0, 1)
(3.2.24)
hold for any set Xh of collocation points with 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1. The
constants Cν depend on the collocation parameters {ci} and but not on h.
Proof The collocation error eh := y −uh satisﬁes the equation
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + (Veh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(3.2.25)
with eh(0) = 0. Recall now the analogous error equations for ODEs, (1.1.25),
and for second-kind VIEs, (2.2.32), as well as the local representations (1.1.22)
and (1.1.23) for eh and e′
h; they are, respectively,

we recall the proofs of Theorem 1.1.2 and Theorem 2.2.3, all the essential ingre-
dients for proving Theorem 3.2.3 are in place, and therefore we will just focus
on the main steps, leaving most of the details to the reader. Consider ﬁrst the ex-
pression for (Veh)(tn,i) in (2.2.32): the only changes necessary to adapt it to the
present situation consist in replacing the Lagrange polynomials L j(s) by their
integrals β j(s), and the Peano remainder terms Rm,ℓ(s) by Rm+1,ℓ(s) (ℓ≤n).

whenever hn ∈(0, ¯h), and hence there exists a constant D0 < ∞so that
||(Im −hnBn)−1||1 ≤D0 uniformly for 0 ≤n ≤N −1. Equation (3.2.30) now
leads to the estimate
||En||1 ≤D0 [

(3.2.31)
Here we have used the notation introduced in Sections 1.1.2 and 2.2.2. It follows
from the continuity relation (3.2.28) that
|eh(tn)| ≤¯b

3.2 Collocation for linear VIDEs

Moreover, bounds for the error terms ρ(ℓ)
n (ℓ< n) and ρn are readily found from
the deﬁnition of their components given above; they are, respectively,
||ρ(ℓ)
n ||1 ≤m ¯Kkm Mm+1
(ℓ< n) and
||ρn||1 ≤m(A0 + h ¯K)km Mm+1.
Thus, observing that sums of the form n−1
ℓ=0 hℓare bounded by T uniformly
for 0 ≤n ≤N −1, the above inequality for ||En||1 reduces to a generalized
discrete Gronwall inequality,
||En||1 ≤γ0
n−1

ℓ=0
hℓ||Eℓ||1 + γ1Mm+1hm,
0 ≤n ≤N −1.
Hence, as in the proofs of Theorems 1.1.2 and 2.2.3, this leads to the uniform
estimate
||En||1 ≤γ1Mm+1hm exp(γ0T ) =: BMm+1hm,
0 ≤n ≤N −1,
and so (3.2.32) yields
|eh(tn)| ≤(¯bB + km)T Mm+1hm
(1 ≤n ≤N −1).
Recalling the error representations (3.2.26) and (3.2.27) and employing by now
familiar notation, we ﬁnd the estimates
|eh(tn + vhn)| ≤|eh(tn)| + h ¯β||En||1 + hm+1km Mm+1
≤[(¯bB + km)T + h( ¯βB + hkm]Mm+1hm =: C0Mm+1hm
and
|e′
h(tn + vhn)| ≤m||En||1 + hmkm Mm+1
≤(m B + km)Mm+1hm =: C1Mm+1hm,
uniformly for v ∈[0, 1] and 0 ≤n ≤N −1 (h ∈(0, ¯h)). Since the constants
C0 and C1 depend (via the bound B for ||En||1 and the bound Mm+1) on
||y(m+1)||∞, this concludes the proof of Theorem 3.2.3.
As we know from the error analyses in the two preceding chapters, less
than full regularity (y ∈Cd(I) with d < m + 1) will imply a lower order of
global convergence for uh. The above proof, with appropriate form of Peano’s
Theorem, is thus readily modiﬁed to furnish the following convergence result.
Theorem 3.2.4 Suppose that the regularity assumption (a) in Theorem 3.2.3 is
replaced by:
(a′) The given functions in (3.2.3) satisfy a, g ∈Cd(I) and K ∈Cd(D), for
some d with 1 ≤d < m.

3 VIDEs with smooth kernels
If (b) of Theorem 3.2.3 holds, then the estimates
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cν||y(d+1)||∞hd
(ν = 0, 1)
are best possible and hold for any set Xh of collocation points with 0 ≤c1 <
. . . < cm ≤1.
On the other hand, a judicious choice of the {ci} and a higher degree of
regularity for y than in Theorem 3.2.3 will lead to global superconvergence on
I, in complete analogy to Theorem 1.1.3 for ODEs.
Theorem 3.2.5 Assume that the given functions in the linear VIDE (3.2.23)
satisfy a, g ∈Cm+1(I) and K ∈Cm+1(D), and let uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) be the collo-
cation solution to (3.2.23) corresponding to the collocation points Xh. If the m
collocation parameters {ci} deﬁning Xh are chosen so that the orthogonality
condition
J0 :=
 1
0
m

i=1
(s −ci)ds = 0
holds (cf. (1.1.34)), then for all meshes Ih with mesh diameter h ∈(0, ¯h) the
global order of the collocation solution uh on Ih exceeds m:
||y −uh||∞≤Chm+1,
(3.2.33)
with C depending on the {ci} and on ||y(m+2)||∞but not on h.
Proof Starting with the defect δh induced by uh,
δh(t) := −u′
h(t) + f (t, uh(t)) + (Vuh)(t),
t ∈I,
with f (t, y) = a(t)y + g(t), we have
δh(t) = e′
h(t) −a(t)eh(t) −(Veh)(t),
t ∈I,
and thus, by the estimates in Theorem 3.2.3,
||δh||∞≤C1hm + A0C0hm + ¯KC0hm =: Dhm,
with A0 := ||a||∞and ¯K := ||V||∞. Hence, since the collocation error is the
solution of the initial-value problem
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + δh(t) + (Veh)(t),
t ∈I,
eh(0) = 0,
(3.2.34)
it may be written in the form
eh(t) = r(t, 0)eh(0) +

(3.2.35)

3.2 Collocation for linear VIDEs
173
(cf. Theorem 3.1.1). Except for the deﬁnition of the resolven kernel r(t, s),
which is now given by the solution of the resolvent equations (3.1.8) or (3.1.9),
the above error representation is formally identical with (1.1.38) for linear
ODEs. Thus, taking into account the regularity of r(t, s) and of the defect δh in
the subintervals σn, we are able to complete the proof of Theorem 3.2.3 exactly
along the lines of the one for Theorem 1.1.3 (or Theorem 2.2.5), to arrive at the
desired global estimate (3.2.33).
3.2.4 Local superconvergence results
When we proved the result on global superconvergence for VIDEs (Theorem
3.2.5) we pointed out that the formal analysis was identical with the one we
used in Section 1.1.3 for establishing such results for ODEs. In addition, we
saw that the key to establishing local superconvergence results for uh and u′
h on
Ih was the resolvent representation of the collocation error eh and its derivative
e′
h in terms of the defect δh, namely
eh(t) =
 t
0
r(t, s)δh(s)ds,
t ∈I
(3.2.36)
and
e′
h(t) = r(t, t)δh(t) +
 t
0
∂r(t, s)
∂t
δh(s)ds,
t ∈I,
(3.2.37)
where r(t, t) = 1 on I. For linear VIDEs an analogous (and formally identical)
resolvent representation holds (Theorem 3.1.1), with the differential resolvent
r(t, s) of the linear VIDE (3.2.23) deﬁned by
∂r(t, s)
∂s
= −r(t, s)a(s) −
 t
s
r(t, v)K(v, s)dv,
(s, t) ∈D
(3.2.38)
(cf. (3.1.8)), again with r(t, t) = 1 for t ∈I.
Thus, in view of these observations it is not surprising that Theorem 1.1.4
and its corollaries remain valid for ﬁrst-order VIDEs.
Theorem 3.2.6 Assume:
(a) The given functions in (3.2.23) satisfy a, g ∈Cm+κ(I) and K ∈Cm+κ(D),
for some integer κ ≥1 speciﬁed in (c) below.
(b) u ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the collocation solution to (3.2.23) with respect to the col-
location points Xh.

3.2 Collocation for linear VIDEs
175
Corollary 3.2.8 If the {ci} are the Radau II points (corresponding to (3.2.39)
with κ = m −1 and cm = 1), then
max
t∈Ih\{0} |e(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνh2m−1
(ν = 0, 1).
Corollary 3.2.9 For the continuously differentiable collocation solution corre-
sponding to the Lobatto points {ci}, 0 = c1 < . . . < cm = 1 (κ = m −2, with
m ≥2 in (3.2.39)), the attainable order of uh ∈S(1)
m (Ih) and u′
h is described by
max
t∈Ih |e(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνh2(m−1)
(ν = 0, 1).
Remark The above order estimates remain valid for the discretised collocation
solution ˆuh : the ‘perturbation argument’ of Section 2.2.6 can again be used to
show that the order of ||uh −ˆuh||∞, as well as the one for |uh(tn) −ˆuh(tn)| (n =
1, . . . , N), match the orders of the exact collocation error on I and on Ih,
respectively.
Theorem 3.2.10 Suppose that the collocation equation deﬁning the exact col-
location solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for the VIDE (3.2.23) is discretised by interpo-
latory m-point quadrature formulas based on the collocation parameters {ci}.
Then the resulting discretised collocation solution ˆuh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) has the same
global and local (super-) convergence properties as uh itself.
3.2.5 Neutral and higher-order VIDEs
In Section 3.1.2 we introduced the ﬁrst-order VIDE (3.1.13),
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)) +
 t
0
k(t, s, y(s), y′(s))ds,
t ∈I,
y(0) = y0, (3.2.42)
and its linear version,
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + g(t) + (V0y)(t) + (V1y′)(t),
(3.2.43)
with Vi : C(I) →C(I) given by
(V0φ)(t) :=
 t
0
K0(t, s)φ(s)ds,
and
(V1φ)(t) :=
 t
0
K1(t, s)φ(s)ds,
as special cases of higher-order ‘neutral’ VIDEs. In this section we will derive
the collocation equations and corresponding convergence results for the latter.

i=1
(s −ci)ds = 0,
ν = 0, . . . , κ −1,

Then, for h ∈(0, ¯h), with ¯h > 0 deﬁned in Theorem 3.2.1, the collocation error
satisﬁes
max
t∈Ih |eh(t)| ≤C0hm+κ,
(3.2.40)
If cm = 1, then u′
h exhibits the same order of local superconvergence as uh:
max
t∈Ih\{0} |e′
h(t)| ≤Chm+κ
1
,
(3.2.41)
while for cm < 1 we only obtain |e′
h(tn)| = O(hm) (1 ≤n ≤N). The constants
C0 and C1 depend on the {ci} and on ||y(m+κ+1)||∞but not on h.
Proof Consider (3.2.36) with t = tn:
eh(tn) =
 tn

r(tn, s)δh(s)ds

n−1

ℓ=0
hℓ
 1
0
r(tn, tℓ+ shℓ)δh(tℓ+ shℓ)ds
(n = 1, . . . , N).
The assertion (3.2.40) now follows immediately along the lines of the proof
of Theorem 1.1.4, by observing the regularity of the differential resolvent
r = r(t, s) (which is governed by the assumed regularity of a and K; i.e.
r ∈Cm+κ+1(D)) and the piecewise smoothness of the defect δ = δh(t) on each
subinterval σn (depending on the regularity of g).
If cm = 1 we have δh(tn) = 0 (since now tn ∈Xh), and hence (3.2.37) yields
e′
h(tn) =
 tn
0
∂r(tn, s)
∂t
δh(s)ds,
n = 1, . . . , N.
Thus, the by now familiar quadrature argument carries over, with the role of
r(tn, s) in the above expression for eh(tn) assumed by (∂/∂t)r(tn, s).
Theorem 3.2.6 yields the following obvious corollaries generalising the re-
sults of Corollaries 1.1.5–1.1.7:
Corollary 3.2.7 Let the {ci} be so that the orthogonality condition (3.2.39)
holds with κ = m, that is, collocation is at the Gauss points. Then
max
t∈Ih |eh(t)| ≤Ch2m,
while maxt∈Ih |e′
h((t)| = O(hm) only.

The proofs of the analogous theorems for kth-order ODEs follow then as special
cases, as announced in Section 1.4.
Let k ≥2 be a given integer and consider the initial-value problem

polynomial space
S(d)
m+d(Ih) := {v ∈Cd(I) : v| ¯σn ∈πm+d (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}
with d = k −1 ≥1. We know that the dimension of this linear space is
dimS(d)
m+d(Ih) = Nm + d + 1 = Nm + k
(see Section 2.2.1). Let Xh, the set of collocation points in I, be as in Section
3.2.1. The collocation solution uh in this space for (3.2.44) is thus deﬁned by

In analogy to the case k = 1 these results are readily extended to the nonlinear
neutral VIDE (3.2.44); the proofs given below for the linear neutral VIDE
suggest how to adapt the key ideas to the nonlinear problem.
Theorem 3.2.11 Assume that the given functions aν, g and Kν in the linear
VIDE (3.2.44)–(3.2.46) are m times continuously differentiable on their respec-
tive domains I and D. Then for all sufﬁciently small h > 0 and any {ci} with
0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 we have the estimates

Proof Weleavetheproofasanexercise:itisastraightforward(butnotationwise

in Theorem 3.2.3 for ﬁrst-order VIDEs.
As we saw in Section 1.4 when we studied the question of global supercon-
vergence in collocation solutions for higher-order ODEs, a judicious choice
of the collocation parameters {ci} leads to O(hm+1)-convergence on I for
u(ν)
h
(ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1). The following theorem shows that this remains true
for higher-order VIDEs.
Theorem 3.2.12 Assume that the given functions aν, g and Kν in (3.2.58) and

3.1.3 (cf. (3.1.18)), we can write the VIDE for the collocation error as a system

We see that we are back on familiar territory: the quadrature arguments we
used in the previous chapters to prove global (and local) superconvergence
results are clearly applicable here, too. Thus, the proof is brought to its end
by observing that ||δh||∞≤Dhm (as a consequence of the global convergence
result in Theorem 3.2.10 and the error equation (3.2.59)). We omit the details.
Note, however, that O(hm+1)-convergence does not hold for u(k)
h
because of
the presence of the term δh(t) in (3.2.63). For this term we have, according to
Theorem 3.2.11 and (3.2.60), ||δh||∞= O(hm) only.
Finally, and by now not surprisingly, the optimal local superconvergence
results of Section 1.2.4 carry over to kth-order VIDEs, since the argument
in the proof of the previous theorem on global superconvergence can be
readily adapted, by setting t = tn (n = 1, . . . , N) in the error representation
(3.2.61),(3.2.62). We deduce that for collocation parameters {ci} with cm < 1
(e.g. the Gauss points) superconvergence of order p∗= 2m at the mesh points
can only be achieved for u(ν)
h with ν < k. If we have cm = 1 (as for the Radau
II points), then u(k)
h (tn) will also exhibit (the same order of) local supercon-
vergence as uh(tn) itself, since tn ∈Xh and hence δh(tn) = 0 in (3.2.63). We
summarise this in

If κ = m −1 and cm = 1 (corresponding to the Radau II points in (0, 1]),
then local superconvergence holds also for u(k)

3.2.6 Collocation in smoother piecewise polynomial spaces
As a consequence of the results of Loscalzo and Talbot (1967) and Loscalzo
(1968), it is clear that the collocation solution uh ∈S(3)
4 (Ih) (classical quartic
splines of degree four) for the VIDE (3.1.1) will be divergent. Hung (1970)
showedthatcollocationsolutionsuh ∈S(µ−1)
µ
(Ih)areconvergentwhenµ = 2, 3
and c1 = 1. He also established the convergence of Hermite-type collocation in
the space S(2)
4 (Ih) (whose dimension is 2N + 3), with collocation at the points
t = tn+1 (n = 0, 1, . . .) corresponding to c1 = c2 = c3 = 1. More recently, Oja
and Tarang (2001) and Oja and Saveljeva (2002) have obtained a number of
signiﬁcant results on the dependence of the convergence of smooth collocation
solutions on the location of the collocation parameters {ci}, using techniques
different from those of M¨ulthei (1979, 1980a).
The general divergence results by M¨ulthei on collocation in S(d)
µ (Ih) for
ODEs remain of course valid for general VIDEs of the form (3.1.1). However,
it is not clear – and remains an open problem – if they can be reﬁned (and are
possibly different) for the special VIDE
y′(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t),
with V as in (3.2.23).

instead on the analysis of local superconvergence on Ih. Since the collocation

H1(t, s) :=
ky(t, s, y(s)) assume the roles of a(t) and K(t, s) in the linear VIDE (3.2.23),

error can be expressed in a form reﬂecting the perturbed error equation (3.3.3),
namely,

(3.3.4)
Comparing this with the error representation (3.2.36) we observe that we now
have two additional nonlinear terms which depend on e2
h. Thus, assuming that
fyy(t, ·) and kyy(t, s, ·) are bounded, the previous quadrature argument com-
bined with the global estimate in Theorem 3.2.3 (cf. the remark at the end of
its proof) and the estimates for these nonlinear terms, e.g.,

3.3 Collocation for nonlinear VIDEs
185
Therefore, the global and local superconvergence results of Theorems 3.2.5
and 3.2.6, and Corollaries 3.2.7–3.2.9 carry over to nonlinear VIDEs, under the
appropriate smoothness and boundedness conditions. Compare also Brunner
(1992a) for additional details.
Remark Alternatively, these superconvergence results can be proved by em-
ploying the nonlinear variation-of-constant formula for (3.3.1). We refer the
reader to the paper by Burgstaller (2000) in which a corrected version of the
nonlinear variation-of-constants formulas contained in Brauer (1972) and Bern-
feld and Lord (1978) has been used. Nonlinear variation-of-constants formulas
for VIDEs can also be found in Hu, Lakshmikantham and Rao (1988).

g(t). The collocation error eh := y −uh solves, as we have already seen above
in a more particular situation, the initial-value problem

k(t −s) (G(y(t), y(s)) −G(uh(t), uh(s)))ds,

Under appropriate regularity assumptions on G = G(y, z) we may write
G(y(t), y(s)) −G(y(t) −eh(t), y(s) −eh(s))
= G y(y(t), y(s))eh(t) + Gz(y(t), y(s))eh(s) + T2(t, s),

with eh(0) = 0. (Here, we have set f (t, y) ≡0 for simplicity: we recall that
this term has been dealt with in Section 1.1.4.) The above error equation is of
the form

W2(t) :=
 t
0
k(t −s)T2(t, s)ds,
and K0(t, s) := k(t −s)Gz(y(t), y(s)). Hence, the solution of the linearised
initial-value problem (3.3.6) for eh is given by
eh(t) =
 t
0
r0(t, s)[δh(s) + W2(t)]ds,
t ∈I.
(3.3.7)
As in the case of standard nonlinear VIDEs the global order of the collocation
error eh corresponding to the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for (3.3.5),
||eh||∞≤Chm,
for any set {ci},
can be derived in a straighforward way. It thus follows from the deﬁnition of
W2(t) and T2(t, s) that, under appropriate smoothness assumptions on the given
functions,
|W2(t)| ≤const.

gument used to derive the earlier ‘classical’ global (on I) and local (on Ih)
superconvergence results we see that they carry over to non-standard VIDEs;
that is, Theorems 3.2.5 and 3.2.6, and Corollaries 3.2.7–3.3.9 remain valid for
(3.3.5).
3.4 Partial VIDEs: time-stepping
The
spatial
semidiscretisation
of
initial-boundary-value
problems
for
(parabolic) partial integro-differential equations is the main source of (high-
dimensional) systems of semilinear VIDEs. Two representative examples are
given below.
Example 3.4.1 Consider the parabolic problem with memory term,
ut(t, x) −u(t, x) = f (t, x) +
 t
0
k(t −s)Bu(s, x)ds,
t ≥0,
x ∈,
u(0, x) = u0(x),
x ∈;
u(t, x) = 0,
t ≥0,
x ∈∂,

3.4 Partial VIDEs: time-stepping
187
where  ⊂IRd is bounded, with piecewise smooth boundary ∂, and B denotes
a (linear or nonlinear) spatial partial differential operator of order not exceeding
two.
Spatial discretisation (e.g. by ﬁnite difference or ﬁnite element techniques)
leads to a (large) system of ordinary VIDEs for U(t) ∈IRM, with M ≫1,
Uh(t)
dt
= AhUh(t) +
 t
0
k(t −s)(BhUh)(s)ds,
t ≥0,
corresponding to discrete versions Ah and Bh of the Laplace operator  and
the operator B. For the common spatial discretisations the dimension M corre-
sponds to the number of interior mesh points resulting from the triangulation of
. Note that Ah ∈L(IRM) is an (unboundedly) stiff matrix (Dekker and Verwer
(1984), Kauthen (1989a,b, 1992)).
Example 3.4.2 In the mathematical modelling of population dynamics involv-
ing spatial dependencies one encounters PVIDEs of the form
ut(t, x) −△u(t, x) = g(t, x) + (T u)(t, x),
x ∈ ⊂IRd, t ∈I
(3.4.1)
(cf. Zhao (2003) and its references), where T denotes the Volterra–Fredholm
integral operator given by
(T u)(t, x) :=
 t
0


K(t, τ, x, ξ)u(τ, ξ)dξ dτ.
(3.4.2)
The integral operator may even contain a delay argument.
Spatial semidiscretisation, in which  is replaced by a suitable triangulation
h, and the use of corresponding appropriate quadrature approximations for the
Fredholm part of the integral operator T , leads to a (large) system of ordinary
VIDEs, similar to the one in Example 3.4.1.
Example 3.4.3 It is well known that, depending on the geometry of the
(bounded or unbounded) spatial domain  ⊂IRd and the ‘size’ of the initial
function u0(x) ≥0, solutions of
ut(t, x) −u(t, x) = u p(t, x),
t > 0,
x ∈ (p > 1),
with u(0, x) = u0(x), x ∈ and u(t, x) = 0, x∂, t ≥0, will blow up in ﬁ-
nite time (see, e.g., the survey by Bandle and Brunner (1998) and its references).
Bellout (1987) showed that the same is true for solutions of parabolic equations
in which the local reaction term u p is replaced by a memory term, e.g.
ut(t, x) −u(t, x) =
 t
0
k(t −s)G(u(s, x))ds,
t > 0,
x ∈,
(3.4.3)

188
3 VIDEs with smooth kernels
with G(u) = u p (p > 1), with initial and boundary conditions as before, and
bounded  (the analogous problem for unbounded  remains open).
If the VIDE (3.4.3) is semidiscretised in space, with respect to a mesh h,
then we obtain a (generally large) system of nonlinear VIDEs of the form
Uh(t)
dt
= AhUh(t) +
 t
0
k(t −s)Gh(U(s))ds,
t > 0.
(3.4.4)
It is clear that since the dynamics of the system (3.4.4) depends both on the
geometry of h and on the approximating (ﬁnite element or collocation) space
and will thus be different from that of (3.4.3), blow-up of the solution of (3.4.3)
will not necessarily imply blow-up for Uh.
Remarks
1. If time-stepping in the above semidiscretised systems of VIDEs is based on
collocation in the space S(0)
m (Ih) with m ≥2, the approximation of the time
integrals (when deriving the fully discretised time-stepping scheme) will be-
come prohibitively expensive. There are a number of ways to ‘economise’
these quadrature approximations; see, for example, Sloan and Thom´ee
(1986).
2. The numerical detection of blow-up remains remains essentially open, in
particular for the classes of (parabolic) partial VIDEs described in Bell-
out (1987) and Souplet (1998a, 1998b). The same is true for the accurate
computation of the blow-up time and corresponding realistic (a posteriori)
error estimates, especially in two- and three-dimensional spatial domains.
Compare also Bandle and Brunner (1994, 1998), especially for references.

properties of their solutions. An important result is given by a generalisation
of the Paley–Wiener Theorem (Paley and Wiener (1934)). We state these two
results for scalar VIEs and VIDEs; analogous results hold for systems of such
Volterra equations with convolution kernels (see Miller (1971a, Appendix I),
also for background material on the Laplace transform).

If k ∈L1(IR+) and if K(s) :=

form of k, then the resolvent kernel R = R(t −s) corresponding to the con-
volution kernel k = k(t −s) is in L1(IR+) if, and only if, A(s) ̸= 1 for all s
with Re(s) ≥s.
Prove this result. An analogous condition holds for matrix kernels k(·) ∈IRm:
det(I −K(s)) ̸= 0 whenever Re(s) ≥0.
2. Grossman and Miller (1973) extended this result to the VIDE

Prove this theorem. The corresponding matrix condition reads
det[sI −A −K(s)] ̸= 0 whenever Re(s) ≥0.
Here, A ∈IRm is the matrix replacing a in the VIDE.

Souplet (1998a, 1998b); in addition; consult the list of references in the sur-
vey paper by Bandle and Brunner (1998).) Here, one is above all interested in
computing very accurate approximations for the blow-up time. However, the
more challenging problem is the numerical detection of blow-up, especially
in partial VIDEs: since numerical time-stepping is usually based on some spa-
tially semidiscretised version of the given PVIDE, the dynamics of the resulting
(high-dimensional) system of ordinary VIDEs will be different from the one of
the original problem.
Exercise 3.5.12 (Research problem)
Discuss the solvability of the system of nonlinear algebraic equations arising
in the (exact and discretised) collocation equation for (stiff) nonlinear VIDEs
(including ‘non-standard’ VIDEs). Analyse the effect of the stopping error in
iterative methods used to solve these systems, e.g. in Newton’s method, on the
attainable order of the method. This will generalise analogous investigations for
ODEs, as given for example in Liu and Kraaijevanger (1988), Spijker (1994),
Jackson, Kvaernø and Nørsett (1996); see also Hairer and Wanner (1996,
pp. 215–224) (and compare with Exercise 2.7.30).

3.6 Notes
3.1: Review of basic Volterra theory (II)
An excellent account of the early theory of VIDEs, and especially of Volterra’s
contributions, can be found in Hellinger and Toeplitz (1927, pp. 1494–1498).
The monograph by Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990) contains many
results on linear and nonlinear VIDEs, as does Corduneanu (1991). See also
the important paper by Nohel and Shea (1976) on global existence of solutions
to nonlinear (Hammerstein-type) VIDEs. A variation-of-constant formula for
linear neutral VIDEs is presented in Wang, Wu and Li (1986); the result is used
to prove the existence of periodic solutions.
Extensions of the Paley–Wiener theorem (Paley and Wiener (1934, pp. 58–
63)) to linear VIDEs with convolution kernels can be found in Grossman and
Miller (1973), Shea and Wainger (1975), and in Lubich (1983b); see also
Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990) and B. Zhang (1997) on the inte-
grability of resolvent kernels.
Ordinary and partial VIDEs with blow-up solutions are studied in Bellout
(1987), Hattori and Lightbourne (1990), and Souplet (1998a, 1998b). The last
paper contains a good bibliography. See also Chadam, Pierce and Yin (1992)
for related problems involving nonlinear Fredholm operators.
Good references on nonlinear Gronwall-type inequalities and comparison
theorems for VIDEs are the books by Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990,
Chapter 10 (Lemma 3.10)) and Gy¨ori and Ladas (1991, Section 9.2).
Applications of VIDEs
The following monographs and conference proceedings contain numerous
applications of VIDEs, as well as extensive lists of references: Cushing
(1977), Brunner (1982a), Burton (1983), Lakshmikantham (1987), Yanik and
Fairweather (1988), Brunner (1989b), Corduneanu (1991), Pr¨uss (1993), Wu
(1996), Agarwal and O’Regan (2000), and Zhao (2003). As in the Notes to the
previous chapter we list a brief selection of more speciﬁc references; most of
these papers and book feature detailed bibliographies.

A survey of such problems was given in Volterra (1912); see also Volterra
(1928). His book of 1959 contains a review of VIDEs arising as models of
hysteresis effects. The book by Visintin (1994) treats the modern theory of
hysteresis. As indicated there, it appears that in spite of Volterra’s pioneering
work of around 1910 many challenging problems remain in the theory and,
especially, the numerical analysis of Volterra integral and integro-differential
equations with hysteresis.

3.2 / 3.3: Collocation for linear and nonlinear VIDEs
The paper by Brunner and Lambert (1974) contains a detailed quantitative and
qualitative analysis of various one-step methods (based on the explicit and
implicit Euler methods) that may be viewed as fully discretised collocation
methods. The A-stability of such methods was also studied in Matthys (1976).
The general convergence and local superconvergence analysis of piecewise
polynomial collocation for linear VIDEs was given in Brunner (1984b, 1988a,
1988b), Brunner and van der Houwen (1986, Chapter 5), and Aguilar and Brun-
ner (1988). Analogous results for nonlinear VIDEs are the subject of Brunner
(1989a, 1989b), while local superconvergence results for higher-order nonlinear

VIDEs can be found in Brunner (1992a). The paper by Brunner (1992b) deals
with collocation methods for VIDEs with Hammerstein nonlinearities. See also
the doctoral dissertation by Burgstaller (1993) for a good treatment of many
aspects of collocation methods for VIDEs.
A survey of spline collocation methods for (partial) differential and integro-
differential equations was given by Fairweather and Meade (1989); it contains a
comprehensivelistofreferences.SeealsothemorerecentpapersbyFairweather
(1994), Ganesh and Spence (1998), Ganesh and Sloan (1999), and Bialecki and
Fairweather (2001) on orthogonal spline collocation methods.
In his doctoral dissertation, Wahr (1977) studies the convergence and nu-
merical implementation of collocation methods for boundary-value problems
in mth-order VIDEs. See also the related paper by Hangelbroek, Kaper and Leaf
(1977) (extension of superconvergence results of de Boor and Swartz (1973)).
The analysis of pseudo-spectral methods for VIDEs is still incomplete. The
reader may wish to consult the paper by Aky¨uz and Sezer (1999) (which deals
with Chebyshev collocation) for additional references.

Of the numerous literature we cite the papers by Sloan and Thom´ee (1986),
Yanik and Fairweather (1988), Thom´ee (1988) (survey paper), Kauthen (1989b,

(1998) contains a comprehensive treatment of spatial (ﬁnite element) and time-
discretisation techniques, as well as a good bibliography.
Post-processing methods
The post-processing (by extrapolation or multilevel iteration correction tech-
niques) of collocation solutions to VIDEs was studied by Hu (1996b) and Hu
and Peng (2000); see also the related analysis of Hu (1998a) for Fredholm
integro-differential equations. We also mention the papers by Zhang, T. Lin,

Y. Lin and Rao (2001) (Galerkin methods), T. Lin, Y. Lin, Rao and Zhang (2000)
and T. Lin, Y. Lin, Luo, Rao and Zhang (2001) (Petrov–Galerkin methods).
Q. Lin and his collaborators have done extensive research on Richardson
extrapolation and defect correction methods for improving the accuracy of
collocation and Galekin ﬁnite-element methods for parabolic and hyperbolic
partial VIDEs. The paper by Q. Lin, Zhang and Yan (1998a) lists many of their
papers. In addition, see Q. Lin and L¨u (1984), Q. Lin and Zhang (1997), Q. Lin,
Zhang and Yan (1997, 1998a, 1998b), and Q. Lin and Zhou (1997a,b).
The discontinuous Galerkin method for VIDEs
The doctoral dissertation by Ma (2004) presents a detailed convergence analysis
of the discontinuous Galerkin methods, especially for non-standard (nonlinear)
VIDEs. Compare also Ma and Brunner (2003).
WR and TR methods
Due to limitation of space we have not dealt with the question on how best
to solve the (large) linear or nonlinear systems of algebraic equations result-
ing from the computational form of the collocation equations for systems of
VIDEs. As we have brieﬂy seen in Section 3.4, such systems are typically
encountered in time-stepping for semi-discretised semi-linear partial VIDEs.
Waveform relaxation (WR) methods and their discrete analogues, time-point
relaxation methods, have recently received considerable attention. The reader
will ﬁnd information on theoretical and computational aspects of such methods
in, e.g., Crisci, Ferraro and Russo (1996), Crisci, Russo and Vecchio (1997,
1998); see also the doctoral thesis by Parsons (1999) and the paper by Brunner,
Crisci, Russo and Vecchio (2003) (on weakly singular VIDEs). Jackiewicz and
Kwapisz (1997) and Zubik-Kowal and Vandewalle (1999) study WR methods
for general functional differential equations.

Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
The functional equations considered in the previous three chapters had the com-
mon feature that smooth data led to smooth solutions. This will in general no
longer be true if the equation contains a non-vanishing delay: such delays induce
so-called primary discontinuity points at which the regularity of the solution
will be lower, at least initially, than that of the given functions. Thus, supercon-
vergence can only occur if the meshes underlying the collocation spaces are
chosen so as to reﬂect this behaviour of the analytic solutions.
4.1 Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays
4.1.1 Deﬁnitions and notation
The initial-value problem for a ﬁrst-order delay differential equation (DDE) is
described by
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t))),
t ∈I := [t0, T ],
(4.1.1)
y(t) = φ(t),
t ≤t0.
The DDE (4.1.1) is also referred to as a retarded differential equation. We will
assume that the delay function (or: lag function) θ(t) := t −τ(t) is continu-
ous and strictly increasing on I, and that the delay τ(t) is strictly positive on
I : τ(t) ≥τ0 > 0 for all t ∈I.
A DDE containing also the derivative of the unknown solution at the points
θ(t),
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t)), y′(θ(t))),
t ∈I,
(4.1.2)
196

4.1 Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays
197
is called a neutral DDE. Neutral DDEs often occur in a somewhat different, but
related form – often called Hale’s form – namely,
d
dt [y(t) −G(t, y(θ(t))] = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t))),
t ∈I.
(4.1.3)
The most complex situation arises if the lag function θ depends also on
the unknown solution, θ = θ(t, y(t)) = t −τ(t, y(t)): we then speak of a DDE
with state-dependent delay.
The following deﬁnition, together with examples, may be found in Bellen
and Zennaro (2003, Section 2.2).
Deﬁnition 4.1.1 The points {ξµ : µ ≥0} generated by the recursion
θ(ξµ+1) = ξµ+1 −τ(ξµ+1) = ξµ,
µ = 0, 1, . . . ; ξ0 := t0,
(4.1.4)
are called the primary discontinuity points associated with the lag function
θ(t) = t −τ(t).
As the name indicates, at these points the solution of a DDE, regardless of
how regular the given functions are, will in general exhibit a low degree of
regularity: for example, at t = ξ0 = t0 the solution will be continuous but will
have a discontinuous derivative. We note that additional, so-called secondary
discontinuity points may arise if the given initial function φ is only piecewise
continuous, that is, if it contains one ore more ﬁnite jump discontinuities.
Illustration
1. If τ(t) = τ > 0 is constant, then the primary discontinuity points induced
by θ(t) = t −τ are
ξµ = t0 + µτ,
µ = 0, 1, . . . .
2. Let I := [t0, T ] be such that t0 > 0. Then the lag function θ(t) = qt = t −
(1 −q)t (0 < q < 1) corresponds to the non-vanishing proportional delay
τ(t) = (1 −q)t. The corresponding primary discontinuity points are given
by
ξµ = q−µt0,
µ = 0, 1, . . . .
We note that for t0 = 0 there are no primary discontinuity points: as we will
see in Chapter 5, in this case smooth data lead to smooth solutions on I.
Deﬁnition 4.1.2
(i) The lag function θ(t) = t −τ(t) describes a fading memory if there exists
a τ1 > 0 so that τ(t) ≤τ1 for all t ≥t0.

198
4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
(ii) The delay τ is said to be bounded if sup{τ(t) : t ≥t0} < ∞.
(iii) The delay τ is called unbounded if τ(t) →∞as t →∞.
Note that for the delay function θ(t) := qt = t −(1 −q)t (0 < q < 1), with
t0 > 0, we have τ(t) = (1 −q)t, and hence τ is unbounded, while the constant
delay τ(t) = τ > 0 is bounded.
A detailed discussion of DDEs with more general (e.g. non-monotonic) θ
can be found in Chapters 1 and 2 of the monograph by Bellen and Zennaro
(2003). In addition, see the papers by de Gee (1985), Will´e and Baker (1992),
Baker, Paul and Will´e (1995a), and the survey Baker (2000) on the implications
of delays of various types on their solutions.
Standard introductions to the general theory of DDEs are Bellman and Cooke
(1964), Halanay (1966), El’sgol’ts and Norkin (1973), Driver (1977), Hale
(1977), and Hale and Verduyn Lunel (1993). Compare also Diekmann et al.
(1995) and Wu (1996) for more advanced treatments.
4.1.2 Second-kind Volterra integral equations with
non-vanishing delays
The general linear Volterra integral equation with delay (or lag) function θ(t)
has the form
y(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ].
(4.1.5)
Here, V : C(I) →C(I) denotes the classical Volterra integral operator intro-
duced in Chapter 2,
(Vy)(t) :=
 t
t0
K1(t, s)y(s)ds,
(4.1.6)
with kernel K1 ∈C(D), D := {(t, s) : t0 ≤s ≤t ≤T }. The kernel K2 of the
delay integral operator
(Vθ y)(t) :=
 θ(t)
t0
K2(t, s)y(s)ds,
(4.1.7)
is assumed to be continuous in Dθ := {(t, s) : θ(t0) ≤s ≤θ(t), t ∈I}, with
I := [t0, T ]. Throughout this chapter the lag function θ will be subject to the
following conditions (D1)–(D3):
(D1) θ(t) = t −τ(t), τ ∈Cd(I) for some d ≥0;
(D2) τ(t) ≥τ0 > 0 for t ∈I;
(D3) θ is strictly increasing on I.

4.1 Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays
199
Remark The subsequent discussion will reveal that condition (D3) has been
introduced mainly for technical reasons. However, the reader is encouraged
to consult Section 2.1 in Bellen and Zennaro (2003) for many illuminating
examples and remarks on the complications arising if (D3) does not hold. While
the vast majority of delay Volterra equations (including of course those with
constant delay τ > 0) satisfy (D1)–(D3), severe complication will usually arise
when the lag function θ depends on the solution y.
In applications (for example, in mathematical models for population growth;
see Section 4.1.5 below) one often encounters delay integral equations of the
type
y(t) = g(t) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.1.8)
corresponding to the delay Volterra integral operator
(Wθ y)(t) :=
 t
t0
K(t, s)y(s)ds
(4.1.9)
(or to its nonlinear version, see Section 4.1.5). This delay equation may be
viewed as a particular case of (4.1.5), obtained formally by setting K2 =
−K1 =: −K.
As for DDEs, the given delay integral equation will have to be complemented
by an initial condition,
y(t) = φ(t),
t ∈[θ(t0), t0].
We observe that, in contrast to initial-value problem for DDEs and DVIDEs with
non-vanishing delays (compare Section 4.1.3), the interval in which (4.1.5) is
considered is the left-open interval (t0, T ]: we shall see below (Theorem 4.1.1)
that solutions to Volterra integral equations with non-vanishing delays typi-
cally possess a ﬁnite (jump) discontinuity at t = t0, while for ﬁrst-order DDEs
(and DVIDEs) the solution y is continuous at this point, with the discontinuity
occurring in y′.
However, in complete analogy to DDEs the non-vanishing delay θ gives rise
to the primary discontinuity points {ξµ} for the solution y of (4.1.5): they are
determined by the recursion
θ(ξµ) = ξµ−1,
µ ≥1 (ξµ = t0).
Condition (D2) ensures that these discontinuity points have the (uniform) sep-
aration property
ξµ −ξµ−1 = τ(ξµ) ≥τ0 > 0 for all µ ≥1.

4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
Theorem 4.1.1 Assume that the given functions in (4.1.5) are continuous on
their respective domains and that the lag function θ satisﬁes the above con-
ditions (D1)–(D3). Then for any initial function φ ∈C[θ(t0), t0] there exists a
unique (bounded) y ∈C(t0, T ] solving the delay integral equation (4.1.5) and
coinciding with φ on [θ(t0), t0]. In general, this solution has a ﬁnite (jump)
discontinuity at t = t0:
lim
t→t+
0
y(t) ̸= lim
t→t−
0
y(t) = φ(t0).
The solution is continuous at t = t0 only if the initial function is such that
g(t0) −
 t0
θ(t0)
K2(t0, s)φ(s)ds = φ(t0).
Proof For t ∈I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1] the initial-value problem for (4.1.5) may be
written as a Volterra integral equation of the second kind,
y(t) = gµ(t) +
 t
ξµ
K1(t, s)y(s)ds,
(4.1.10)
with gµ(t) := g(t) + µ(t) and
µ(t) :=
 ξµ
t0
K1(t, s)y(s)ds +
 θ(t)
t0
K2(t, s)y(s)ds.
For µ = 0 this function is known and given by
0(t) = −
 t0
θ(t)
K2(t, s)φ(s)ds;
by our assumptions we have 0 ∈C(I (0)). It follows from the classical Volterra
theory of Chapter 2 that for each µ ≥0 (so that I (µ) ⊂I) the integral equation
(4.1.10) possesses a unique continuous solution in I (µ).
As for its regularity, we ﬁrst observe that for µ = 0 (with ξ0 = t0),
lim
t→t+
0
y(t) = g(t0) + 0(t0) = g(t0) −
 t0
θ(t0)
K2(t0, s)φ(s)ds
which, for arbitrary (continuous) data g, K2, φ, will not coincide with the
value φ(t0). For µ ≥1 we derive

4.1 Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays
201
Hence,
y(ξ +
µ ) −y(ξ −
µ ) = 0,
whenever g, K1, K2 and θ are continuous functions. This completes the proof
of Theorem 4.1.1.
We have seen in Chapter 2 that the solution of a linear Volterra integral
equation of the second kind can be expressed in terms of the resolvent kernel
and the non-homogeneous term g (recall Theorem 2.1.2); this ‘variation-of-
constants’ formula proved to be the key to the establishing of (global and
local) superconvergence results for collocation solutions to such equations. As
the above proof implicitly shows, an analogous representation can be derived
for the solution of the delay Volterra integral equation (4.1.5), since by (D2)
the delay τ = τ(t) in θ(t) = t −τ(t) does not vanish in I. Suppose, for ease
of notation and without loss of generality, that T in I = [t0, T ] is such that
ξM+1 = T (or, alternatively, T ∈(ξM, ξM+1]) for some M ≥1.
Theorem 4.1.2 Suppose that (D1)–(D3) and the assumptions of Theorem 4.1.1
hold, and set
g0(t) := g(t) −
 t0
θ(t)
K2(t, s)φ(s)ds
for t ∈I (0).
Then for t ∈I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1] (µ ≥1) the unique solution y of (4.1.5) corre-
sponding to the initial function φ can be expressed in the form
y(t) = g(t) +

4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
Remarks
1. The structure of the above variation-of-constants formula (4.1.11) clearly
reveals the interaction between the classical lag term Fµ(t) (governed by the
classical Volterra operator V) and the delay term µ(t) (which reﬂects the
action of the non-vanishing delay function θ). The insight obtained from the
latter will play a crucial role in the selection of appropriate (‘θ-invariant’)
meshes underlying local superconvergence results (Section 4.2.1).
2. Cerha (1976) showed that the solution of a delay VIE whose delay occurs
in the integrand,
y(t) = g(t) +
 t
0
K(t, s)y(θ(s))ds,
t ∈I,
with g ∈C(I) and K ∈C(D), admits a simpler ‘resolvent representation’,
namely
y(t) = g(t) +
 t
0
R(t, s)g(θ(s))ds,
t ∈I.
The resolvent kernel R associated with the given kernel K satisﬁes the
resolvent equations
R(t, s) = K(t, s) +

and

Proof The solution of the integral equation (4.1.10),
y(t) = gµ(t) +

R1(t, v)K1(v, s)dv,
(t, s) ∈D(µ)
(cf. (2.1.9)), where D(µ) := {(t, s) : ξµ ≤s ≤t ≤ξµ+1}. The expression
(4.1.12) for the solution on the interval I (0) thus follows immediately.

Recall now the representation (4.1.13) of the solution y on I (1): after trivial
algebraic manipulation it can be written as
y(t) = g(t) +

Q(1)
1,0(t, s) + ˆQ(1)

g0(s)ds.
This yields (4.1.11) for µ = 1, by setting
R1,0(t, s) := Q(1)
1,1(t, s) + ˆQ(1)
1,1(t, s),
Q1,0(t, s) := Q(1)
1,0(t, s) + ˆQ(1)
1,0(t, s).
Clearly, the functions describing this expression for y are continuous in the
region where they are deﬁned.
The proof is now concluded by a simple but (notationwise) tedious induc-
tion argument. This argument reveals that in the variation-of-constants formula
(4.1.11) the integrals over [ξµ, ξµ+1] with µ ≥1 will contribute terms involving
only g(t), while the integrals over [ξ0, ξ1] and [ξ0, θµ(t)] contain the ‘entire’
initial function g0(t).
The result of Theorem 4.1.2 and its proof lead to the following result on the
regularity of solutions of (4.1.5).

4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
Theorem 4.1.3 Assume that (D1)–(D3) are satisﬁed and that the functions
describing the delay Volterra integral equation (4.1.5) all possess continuous
derivatives of at least order m ≥1 on their respective domains. Then:
(a) The (unique) solution y of (4.1.5) is in Cm(ξµ, ξµ+1] for each µ =
0, 1, . . . , M and is bounded on Z M := {ξµ : µ = 0, 1, . . . , M}, and hence
on I.
(b) At t = ξµ (µ = 1, . . . , min{m, M}) we have
lim
t→ξ −
µ
y(µ−1)(t) = lim
t→ξ +
µ
y(µ−1)(t),
while the µ-th derivative of y is in general not continuous at ξµ. In addition,
if min{m, M} = m < M, the solution also lies in Cm[ξm+1, T ].
The proof is left as an exercise (Exercise 4.7.3).
In Section 4.4.2 we shall meet a second-kind delay VIE that is somewhat
more general than (4.1.8), namely,
y(t) = g(t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈(θ(t0), t0].
(4.1.14)
Since the delay τ in θ(t) = t −τ(t) does not vanish on I the above result on
the existence and uniqueness of a solution of the corresponding initial-value
problem (Theorem 4.1.1), the variation-of-constant formula (Theorem 4.1.2),
and the regularity properties (Theorem 4.1.3) can be generalised to encompass
(4.1.14). We leave the proofs of these generalisations as an exercise (Exercise
4.7.4).
Turning to the regularity and smoothing properties of solutions of delay
VIEs, it is not diffult, on the basis of Theorem 4.1.2, to establish results that
are close analogues of those for DDEs with non-vanishing delays. Due to
limitation of space we will simply summarise some of these results; the proofs
of some of these can be found in Brunner and Zhang (1999). The extension of
the results to delay VIEs with weakly singular kernels can be found in Section
6.1.7 (Table 6.1).
4.1.3 First-kind VIEs with non-vanishing delays
Consider the linear ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equation with lag function θ
satisfying (D1)–(D3),
(Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t) = g(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.1.15)
subject to the initial condition y(t) = φ(t), t ∈[θ(t0), t0]. The (linear) Volterra
integral operators are those of (4.1.6) and (4.1.7). Using the notation of the

Hence,accordingtotheclassicalVolterratheoryof1896,itfollowsthattypically
the solution of (4.1.16) (with µ = 0) will be unbounded at t = t+
0 :
lim
t→t0−y(t) = φ(t0) ̸= lim

(b) K2 ∈C1(Dθ);

4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
(c) g ∈C1(I);
(d) θ is subject to (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.2, with d = 1 in (D1).
Then for any initial function φ ∈C[θ(t0), t0] there exists a unique y with y ∈
C(ξµ, ξµ+1] (µ = 0, 1, . . . , M) which solves (4.1.15) and coincides with φ on
[θ(t0), t0].Thissolution y remainsboundedatt = t0 = ξ0 if,andonlyif,(4.1.19)
holds.
Proof We know from Section 2.1.3 that under the assumptions (a)–(d) the ﬁrst-
kind Volterra integral equation (4.1.16) possesses, for each µ = 0, 1, . . . , M,
a unique solution y ∈C(ξµ, ξµ+1]. At t = ξ +
0 = t+
0 the solution is bounded
if, and only if, g0(ξ0) = 0 which, according to (4.1.18), is equivalent to the
condition (4.1.19).
Is the smoothing property we encountered in solutions of delay Volterra
integral equations of the second kind (Theorem 4.1.3) also present for solutions
of the ﬁrst-kind delay equation (4.1.15)? Let us obtain some insight into the
general answer by looking at a representative example.

For the smooth kernels K1(t, s) ≡1, K2(t, s) ≡λ2 ̸= 0, (4.1.15) reads

On (t0, ξ1] we ﬁnd the solution to be
y(t) = g′
0(t) = g′(t) −λ2φ0θ′(t).

It is bounded at t = t+
0 if, and only if, the initial function is such that g(t0) = 0,
implying that
φ0 = −g(t0)
λ2τ(t0)
holds (recall that t −θ(t) = τ(t), with strictly positive delay τ(t)). We observe
also that under this hypothesis,
y(t+
0 ) = g′(t0) −λ2φ0θ′(t0) = g′(t0) + g(t0)θ′(t0)/τ(t0);
thus, y(t+
0 ) ̸= φ(t0) for general data.
Let now µ = 1: using the above results and deﬁnitions we ﬁnd
g1(t) = g(t) −

and hence
g1(ξ1) = g(ξ0) + λ2φ0(ξ0 −θ(ξ0)) = g(t0) + λ2φ0τ(t0).
If the boundedness condition (4.1.19) is true, then it follows that g1(ξ1) =
g0(t0) = 0. In other words, boundedness of y at t = t0 = ξ0 implies bounded-
ness at t = ξ1; an analogous argument yields then boundedness at the remaining
points of Z M. Moreover, we ﬁnd from the expressions
y(ξ −
1 ) = g′(ξ1) + g(ξ0)θ′(ξ0)/τ(ξ0)
and
y(ξ +
1 ) = g′(ξ1) −λ2θ′(ξ1){g′(ξ0) + g(ξ0)θ′(ξ0)/τ(ξ0)}.
that the jump at t = ξ1 is given by
y(ξ +
1 ) −y(ξ −
1 ) = −λ2g′(t0)θ′(ξ1) −g(t0)θ′(t0)[1 + λ2θ′(t0)]/τ(t0).
Clearly, the jump discontinuity of y at t = t0 will lead to such a discontinuity at
the next primary discontinuity point t = ξ1: even if the boundedness condition
(4.1.19) is fulﬁlled, there is no smoothing in the solution of the ﬁrst-kind delay
Volterra integral equation (4.1.20).
The analysis for the particular ﬁrst-kind delay integral equation (4.1.20)
is readily generalised to encompass (4.1.15). We summarise the result in the
following theorem but leave the proof of the result to the reader.
Theorem 4.1.5 Let the assumptions of Theorem 4.1.4 for the given functions in
(4.1.15) hold, and assume that the initial function φ ∈C[θ(t0), t0] is such that
the solution y of the initial-value problem for (4.1.15) is bounded at t = t+
0 .

4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
If y possesses a ﬁnite discontinuity at t = t0, then the discontinuity persists at
the other points of Z M.
4.1.4 VIDEs with non-vanishing delays
In this section we study the properties of solutions of the linear ﬁrst-order delay
VIDE
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + g(t) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t), t ∈I := [t0, T ],
(4.1.21)
corresponding to the Volterra integral operators V and Vθ introduced in (4.1.6)
and (4.1.7). It includes the analogue of the particular delay VIE (4.1.8),
namely
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + g(t) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈I.
(4.1.22)
The solutions y of the delay VIDE (4.1.21) (and hence those of (4.1.22))
will in general again have lower regularity at the primary discontinuity points
{ξµ} deﬁned by the recursion
θ(ξµ) = ξµ−1,
µ = 1, . . . (ξ0 = t0)
(cf. Section 4.1.1).
We start with a basic result on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of
the initial-value problem for (4.1.21).
Theorem 4.1.6 Assume:
(a) a, b, g, θ ∈C(I), K1 ∈C(D), K2 ∈C(Dθ);
(b) θ(t) = t −τ(t) satisﬁes the conditions (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.2.
Then for any initial function φ ∈C[θ(t0), t0] there exists a unique function
y ∈C(I) ∩C1(t0, T ] which satisﬁes the delay VIDE (4.1.21) on I and coincides
with φ on [θ(t0), t0]. At t = t0 its derivative is, in general, discontinuous (but
bounded):
lim
t→t+
0
y′(t) ̸= lim
t→t−
0
y′(t) = φ′(t0)
(assuming that θ′(t0) exists).
The proof is left as an exercise (for which the lines preceding Theorem 4.1.9
below may be helpful).
The (unique) solution y of the initial-value problem for (4.1.21) can be
expressed by a variation-of-constant formula, analogous to the one in Theorem

4.1 Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays
209
4.1.2 for the delay VIE (4.1.5). This result is based on the ‘local’ form of the
above delay VIDE, that is, on the initial-value problem with respect to the
interval I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1] (µ = 1, . . . , M):
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + gµ(t) +

and assume that the delay function θ is subject to (D1)–(D3). Then on the
interval I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1] (µ ≥1) the solution of the initial-value problem for

r1 = r1(t, s) denotes the resolvent kernel for K1 = K1(t, s) deﬁned by the re-
solvent equation (4.1.27).
Remark As in Theorem 4.1.2 we see again how the presence of the delay
term (Vθ y)(t) in (4.1.21) inﬂuences the resolvent representation of the classical
(non-delay) VIDE on the macro-interval I (µ). In addition, we now have terms
reﬂecting the initial values y(ξν) (0 ≤ν ≤µ).
Proof The basic idea governing the proof of the above result is essentially the
one used to establish Theorem 4.1.2, except that now the variation-of-constant
formula is based on the resolvent representation of the solution of the ‘local’
VIDE (4.1.26) and will thus reﬂect the initial values y(ξµ). Due to this similarity,
we just sketch the ﬁrst steps of the proof. For µ = 0 (t ∈I (0)) the solution of
(4.1.26) is

Thus, starting with µ = 1, and noting that the double integrals in the corre-
sponding above equation have already been encountered in the proof of Theo-
rem 4.1.2, the use of Dirichlet’s formula and a simple induction argument yield
the main proposition of Theorem 4.1.8 in a straightforward way.

4.1 Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays

For the sake of completeness, and since in Section 4.5.4 on neutral functional
integro-differential equations we shall have to resort to the result, we add the
following corollary on solutions to DDEs with non-vanishing delays.
Corollary 4.1.8 Consider the delay differential equation
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + g(t),
t ∈I := [t0, T ],
(4.1.30)
with y(t) = φ(t) on [θ(t0), t0]. If the given functions are continuous, with θ
subject to the conditions (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.2, then the (unique) solution
y of this initial-value problem is given on I (µ) (µ ≥1) by

(t, s) ∈D.
The continuous functions rµ,ν and qµ,ν depend on a, b, θ and r.
If the data in the delay VIDE (4.1.21) are smooth functions, the correspond-
ing solution will essentially inherit this smoothness, except – similar to delay
VIEs of the second kind – at the primary discontinuity points {ξµ}. This is made
precise in
Theorem 4.1.9 Let a, b, g, K1, K2 and φ in (4.1.21) be Cm-functions on
their respective domains, and assume that the delay θ is subject to the conditions
(D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.2, with d ≥m. Then:
(a) The (unique) solution of the initial-value problem for (4.1.21) is (m +
1)-times continuously differentiable on each left-open macro-interval
(ξµ, ξµ+1] and has a bounded ﬁrst derivative on I.

while the (µ + 1)st derivative of y is in general not continuous at t = ξµ.
If min{m, M} = m < M, the solution possesses a continuous (m + 1)st
derivative on [ξm, T ].

We will again summarise a number of regularity and smoothing results in a
table; proofs (which can be based on Theorem 4.1.7) are left to the reader. See
also Brunner and Zhang (1999).

4.1.5 Nonlinear delay problems
Nonlinear Volterra integral and integro-differential equations with non-
vanishing delays have been used since the 1920s as mathematical models of
population growth and related phenomena in biology. In this section we will
brieﬂy describe two such classes of Volterra functional equations; comments
pointing to additional sources of nonlinear delay Volterra equations will be
added at the end.
Example 4.1.1
In Part IV (‘Studio delle azioni ereditarie’) of his 1927 paper Volterra reﬁned
his earlier celebrated (ODE) ‘predator–prey’ model to include situations where
‘historical actions cease after a certain interval of time’ (see also Volterra (1939),

4.1 Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays

p. 8). This leads to a system of nonlinear Volterra integro-differential equations
with constant delay T0 > 0 (using again Volterra’s notation),

with εi > 0, γi ≥0, and continuous Fi(t) ≥0. Volterra later extended this
model and its analysis to n interacting populations (see also his survey paper
of 1939). Cushing (1977) is an excellent source on the further development of
such population models based on VIDEs with delays; see also Bocharov and
Rihan (2000) and its bibliography.
Example 4.1.2
Many basic mathematical models in epidemiology and population growth (see,
e.g.CookeandYorke(1973),Waltman(1974),Cooke(1976),andSmith(1977))
are described by nonlinear Volterra integral equations of the second kind with
(constant) delay τ > 0, namely,
y(t) =
 t
t−τ
P(t −s)G(s, y(s))ds + g(t),
t > t0,
(4.1.34)
or
y(t) =
 t
t−τ
P(t −s)G(y(s) + g(s))ds,
t > t0.
(4.1.35)
Here, g is usually assumed to be such that limt→∞g(t) =: g(∞) exists. These
delay integral equations model the deterministic growth of a population y =
y(t) (e.g. of animals, or cells) or the spread of an epidemic with immigration
into the population; it also has applications in economics.
Example 4.1.3
A generalisation of the above model is discussed in B´elair (1991): here, the
delay τ in the delay (or: lag) function θ(t) := t −τ(y(t)) (life span) is no longer
constant but depends on the size y(t) of the population at time t (reﬂecting, e.g.
crowding effects). B´elair’s model corresponds to the delay VIE with state-
dependent delay,
y(t) =
 t
t−τ(y(t))
P(t −s)G(y(s))ds,
t > 0,
(4.1.36)
with P(t) ≡1. Here it is assumed that the number of births is a function of
the population size only (that is, the birth rate is density dependent but not age
dependent). For this choice of the kernel P it is tempting to ‘simplify’ the delay

214
4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
VIE, by differentiating it with respect to t, to obtain the state-dependent (but
‘local’) DDE
y′(t) = G(y(t)) −G(y(t −τ(y(t))))
1 −τ ′(y(t))G(y(t −τ(y(t)))) .
(4.1.37)
While any constant y(t) = yc solves the above DDE, this is not true in the
original DVIE (2.1.36): it is easily veriﬁed that y(t) = yc is a solution if, and
only if, yc = G(yc)τ(yc). This simple example also contains a warning: the use
of the the DDE (2.1.37) as the basis for the (‘indirect’) numerical solution of
the delay VIE (2.1.36) may lead to approximations for y(t) that do not correctly
reﬂect the dynamics of the original (highly nonlinear) delay integral equation.
4.1.6 Volterra functional equations of neutral type
The delay differential and integro-differential equations we have studied so far
are functional equations of retarded type: the derivative y′(t) of the unknown
function depends on y(t) and y(θ(t)) but not on y′(θ(t)). As we have seen, one
of the consequences of this is that the solutions become smoother at the primary
discontinuity points {ξµ}. This is in general no longer true if the delay equation
of of neutral type, as the simple linear model problem
y′(t) −cy′(θ(t)) = ay(t) + by(θ(t)),
t ≥t0,
y(t) = φ(t) ̸≡0, t ≤t0,
(4.1.38)
with c ̸= 0 and θ(t) = t −τ, readily shows. The following theorem is repre-
sentative of neutral differential equations more general than (4.1.38). Its proof,
and a general discussion of DDEs of neutral type, can be found in, e.g. the
books by El’sgol’ts and Norkin (1973) and, especially, Hale (1977) and Hale
and Verduyn Lunel (1993).
Theorem 4.1.10 Assume that φ ∈C1[θ(t0, t0]. Then there exists a unique func-
tion y that coincides with φ on [θ(t0, t0], is in C1 and satisﬁes (4.1.38) for t ≥0,
except possibly at the points ξµ = µτ (µ ≥0). This solution cannot have higher
regularity than the initial function φ, and it is a C1-function for t ≥0 if, and
only if, φ is such that
φ′(t0 −cφ′(θ(t0) = aφ(t0) + bφ(θ(t0) + g(t0).
Will the result of Theorem 4.1.10 substantially remain valid if the right-hand
side of (4.1.38) also contains a memory term, for example
(W1
θ y)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)

K1(t, s)y(s) + K2(t, s)y′(s)

4.1 Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays
215
To study this question consider the general (nonlinear) ﬁrst-order delay VIDE
of neutral type,
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t)), y′(θ(t))) + (V1y)(t) + (V1
θ y)(t),
t ∈I, (4.1.39)
where the kernels of the Volterra operators V1 and V1
θ also depend on y′(s):
(V1y)(t) :=
 t
t0
k1(t, s, y(s), y′(s))ds,
(V1
θ y)(t) :=
 θ(t)
t0
k2(t, s, y(s), y′(s))ds.
We will also consider the important case
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t)), y′(θ(t))) + (W1
θ y)(t),
t ∈I,
(4.1.40)
corresponding to the (nonlinear) Volterra operator
(W1
θ y)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)
k(t, s, y(s), y′(s))ds.
As we have seen in Section 4.1.1, neutral delay differential equations often
occur in what we called ‘Hale’s form’, which for (4.1.38) with θ(t) = t −τ is
given by
d
dt [y(t) −cy(θ(t))] = ay(t) + by(θ(t)),
t ≥t0,
(4.1.41)
with y(t) = φ(t) when t ∈[θ(t0), t0] (see also Liu (1999a, 1999b)). Note that
here the initial function need only satisfy φ ∈C[θ(t0), t0]. An obvious gener-
alisation of this simple neutral functional equation is given by
d
dt [y(t) −(Vθ y)(t)] = F(t, y(t), y(θ(t))),
t ∈I,
(4.1.42)
with y(t) = φ(t), t ∈[θ(t0, t0] and
(Vθ y)(t) :=
 θ(t)
0
k2(t, s, y(s))ds
(compare also Brunner and Vermiglio (2003)). Its ‘local’ counterpart is the
neutral DDE
d
dt [y(t) −G(t, y(θ(t)))] = F(t, y(t), y(θ(t))),
(4.1.43)
corresponding to a smooth function G.
In view of applications, and to prepare for the collocation analysis to be
presented in Section 4.5.4 we will focus on NFIDEs in the class (4.1.42). Results
on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the above initial-value problems
can be obtained by considering the integrated forms of (4.1.42) and (4.1.43):

216
4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
they are, respectively,
y(t) = 0 + (Vθ y)(t) +
 t
t0
F(s, y(s), y(θ(s)))ds,
t ∈I,
(4.1.44)
with y(t) = φ(t), t ≤t0, and 0 := φ(t0) −(Vθφ)(t0); and
y(t) = 0 + G(t, y(θ(t)) +
 t
t0
F(s, y(s), y(θ(s)))ds,
t ∈I,
(4.1.45)
with 0 := φ(t0) −G(t0, φ(t0)). These NFIDEs are thus equivalent to initial-
value problems for nonlinear second-kind Volterra integral equations with delay
function θ. Their existence and uniqueness theory is a straightforward conse-
quence of Theorems 4.1.1.
Alternatively, setting
z(t) := y(t) −(Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I,
(4.1.46)
and
H(t, z, w) := F(t, z + Vθ y, w),
(4.1.47)
the initial-value problem (4.1.42) can be reformulated as an initial-value prob-
lem for z,
z′(t) = H(t, z(t), y(θ(t))),
t ∈I,
(4.1.48)
z(t0) = φ(t0) −(Vθφ)(t0) (= 0),
whose solution then determines the solution y of the orginal problem (4.1.42)
via the recursion
y(t) = z(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I,
(4.1.49)
with y(t) = φ(t) when t ≤t0. Clearly, the DDE (4.1.48) may be viewed as a
sequence of initial-value problems on I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1] for a nonlinear ODE,
with the explicit recursion (4.1.49) furnishing the expression for y(θ(t)). This
reformulation can also be used to obtain insight into the regularity properties
of the solution y of the original NFIDE (4.1.42).
We note in passing the the analogous reformulation of the NDE (4.1.43) is
z′(t) = H(t, z(t), y(θ(t))),
t ∈I,
(4.1.50)
z(t0) = φ(t0) −G(t0, φ(t0)) (= 0 ),
with
z(t) := y(t) −G(t, y(θ(t)))
and
H(t, z, w) := F(t, z + G(t, y), w),

(compare Liu (1999a), Vermiglio and Torelli (1998), Torelli and Vermiglio
(2002) and, especially, Bellen and Zennaro (2003, Section 3.2.3)).
4.2 Collocation methods for DDEs: a brief review
A comprehensive treatment of continuous (explicit and implicit) Runge–Kutta
methods for various classes of delay differential equations, including their con-
vergence and asymptotic stability properties, can be found in the 2003 mono-
graph by Bellen and Zennaro. We therefore restrict our discussion to the pre-
sentation of the basic deﬁnitions and to the description of piecewise polynomial
collocation methods for DDEs. The corresponding convergence results will be
obtained as particular cases of theorems for delay VIDEs (Section 4.5).
4.2.1 Constrained and θ-invariant meshes
Assume that the given delay function θ(t) = t −τ(t) satisﬁes the assumptions
(D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.2 which we recall for the convenience of the reader:
(D1) θ ∈Cd(I) for some d ≥0, with I := [t0, T ];
(D2) τ(t) ≥τ0 > 0 for t ∈I;
(D3) θ is strictly increasing on I.
This implies that the primary discontinuity points {ξµ} induced by θ and given
by
θ(ξµ) = ξµ −τ(ξµ) = ξµ−1,
µ = 1, . . . ,
with ξ0 := t0,
have the (uniform) separation property
ξµ −ξµ−1 ≥τ0 > 0 for all µ ≥1.
For ease of notation we will again assume that T deﬁning I = [t0, T ] is such
that
T = ξM+1
for some M ≥1,
and we recall the set Z M := {ξµ : µ = 0, 1, . . . , M} introduced in Theorem
4.1.3.

4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
Since, as we have already seen in Section 4.1.1, solutions of delay problems
with non-vanishing delays generally suffer from a loss of reguarity at the pri-
mary discontinuity points {ξµ}, the mesh Ih underlying the collocation space
will have to include these points if the collocation solution is to attain its optimal
global (or local) order (of superconvergence). Thus, we shall employ meshes
of the form
Ih :=
M

µ=0
I (µ)
h ,
I (µ)
h
:= {t(µ)
n
: ξµ = t(µ)
0
< t(µ)
1
< . . . < t(µ)
Nµ = ξµ+1}.
(4.2.1)
Such a mesh is called a constrained mesh (with respect to θ) for I. We will
refer to Ih as the macro-mesh and call the I (µ)
h
the underlying local meshes.
Deﬁnition 4.2.1
A mesh Ih for I := [t0, T ] is said to be θ-invariant if it is constrained (that is,
given by (4.2.1)) and if
θ(I (µ)
h ) = I (µ−1)
h
(µ = 1, . . . , M)
(4.2.2)
holds. We then have Nµ = N for all µ ≥0.
Observe that if Ih is θ-invariant then
t ∈I (µ)
h
=⇒
θµ−ν(t) ∈I (ν)
h
(ν = 0, 1, . . . , µ).
(4.2.3)
In analogy to the previous chapters we will use the following notation:
σ (µ)
n
:= (t(µ)
n , t(µ)
n+1], h(µ)
n
:= t(µ)
n+1 −t(µ)
n , h(µ) := max
(n)
h(µ)
n , h := max
(µ)
h(µ),
and ¯σ (µ)
n
:= [t(µ)
n , t(µ)
n+1].
For a given θ-invariant mesh Ih the collocation solution uh will be an element
of a piecewise polynomial space
S(d)
m+d(Ih) := {v ∈Cd(Ih) : v|σ (µ)
n
∈πm+d (0 ≤n < N; 0 ≤µ ≤M)}.
(4.2.4)
It follows from Section 2.1.1 (Deﬁnition 2.2.1) that this linear space has the
dimension
dim S(d)
m+d(Ih) = (M + 1)Nm + d + 1.
This suggests we choose the set of collocation points as
Xh :=
M

µ=0
X(µ)
h
:
(4.2.5)

it is based on the local sets
X(µ)
h
:= {t(µ)
n
+ cih(µ)
n
: 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}.
In the collocation equation for a given delay equation with non-vanishing
delay τ(t) we shall encounter the mapping θ(X(µ)
h ) (see, for example, (4.3.2)).
It is clear that for linear lag functions θ and a given θ-invariant mesh Ih the
set Xh deﬁned in (4.2.5) is also θ-invariant. However, for nonlinear delays this
will no longer be true. We record this important fact – which will affect the
computational form of the collocation equation – in the following lemma. Its
proof is straightforward and is left as an exercise.
Lemma 4.2.1 Assume that the lag function θ satisﬁes (D1)–(D3), and let Ih be
a θ-invariant mesh on I = [t0, T ].
(a) If θ is linear, then
θ(X(µ)
h ) = X(µ−1)
h
,
µ = 1, . . . , M :
the set Xh of collocation points is also θ-invariant.
(b) For nonlinear θ this is no longer true: setting
θ(t(µ)
n
+ cih(µ)
n ) = t(µ−1)
n
+ ˜cih(µ−1)
n
=: ˜t(µ−1)
n,i
(i = 1, . . . , m),
the images {˜ci} of the {ci} satisfy
0 ≤˜c1 < . . . < ˜cm ≤1 (with
˜ci ̸= ci
in general),
and they depend on the micro-interval σ (µ)
n
containing the collocation point
t(µ)
n,i ; that is, we have
˜ci = ˜ci(n; µ) (i = 1, . . . , m).
4.2.2 Collocation and continuous implicit
Runge–Kutta methods
As will become apparent in more detail in the following section on delay VIEs
and VIDEs, collocation solutions in S(0)
m (Ih) to DDEs with non-vanishing delays
satisfying (D1)–(D3) will have the same global and local (super-) convergence
properties as those for ODEs, provided the underlying mesh is constrained and
(for superconvergence) θ-invariant. In the case of ODEs this was ﬁrst observed
by Bellen (1984). Thus, we will not state these convergence results explicitly
here since we shall obtain them in Section 4.1.4 as particular cases of results for
VIDEs with non-vanishing delays. However, we brieﬂy describe the collocation

t ∈I := [t0, T ],

y(t) = φ(t),

and assume that the delay function θ satisﬁes (D1)–(D3). For a θ-invariant mesh
Ih given by (4.2.1) and (4.2.2), let uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) be the collocation solution to

the DDE (4.2.6). We observe that, in contrast to ‘classical’ (discrete) Runge–
Kutta methods, the collocation scheme automatically furnishes the ‘natural’
continuous (local) interpolant on each ¯σ (µ)
n .
Since the results on the attainable orders of global and local (super-)
convergence of collocation solutions uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to DDEs will be obtained
as special cases of such results for VIDEs with non-vanishing delays (Sections
4.4.2 and 4.5.3), we will not state them explicitly here. The ﬁrst comprehensive
convergence analysis of collocation solutions to DDEs was given by Bellen
(1984).
4.3 Collocation for second-kind VIEs with delays
4.3.1 The exact collocation equations
The collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for the delay integral equation
y(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.3.1)
with
(Vy)(t) :=
 t
t0
K1(t, s)y(s)ds,
(Vθ y)(t) :=
 θ(t)
t0
K2(t, s)y(s)ds,
and with initial condition y(t) = φ(t), t ≤t0, is deﬁned by the collocation
equation
uh(t) = g(t) + (Vuh)(t) + (Vθuh)(t),
t ∈Xh.
(4.3.2)
The values of uh at t ∈[θ(t0), t0] are determined by the given initial function for
(4.2.1), uh(t) = φ(t). As for classical second-kind Volterra integral equations
we will also consider the iterated collocation solution corresponding to uh:
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Vuh)(t) + (Vθuh)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ].
(4.3.3)
The lag function θ = θ(t) = t −τ(t) will be assumed to satisfy the con-
ditions (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.2, and the mesh Ih on I := [t0, T ] will be
assumed to be the θ-invariant mesh deﬁned by (4.2.2). As we indicated in
Section 4.2.1 (cf. (4.2.5)) the collocation points Xh are given by
Xh :=

Since the contribution of the classical Volterra term Vuh to the computational
form of the collocation was analysed in detail in Chapter 2, we will focus here
on the terms induced by the delay part (Vθuh)(t) with t = t(µ)
n,i .
Assume ﬁrst that the lag function θ is linear. Since, as we have seen in
Lemma 4.2.1, the θ-invariance of the mesh Ih implies the θ-invariance of the
set Xh of collocation points, we may write, using the fact that θ(t(µ)
n,i ) = t(µ−1)

4.3.2 Global convergence results
The collocation error eh := y −uh associated with the collocation solution
uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for the delay integral equation (4.3.1) solves the initial-value
problem
eh(t) = δh(t) + (Veh)(t) + (Vθeh)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.3.21)
with initial condition eh(t) = 0 for t ∈[θ(t0), t0]. The defect δh vanishes on the
set Xh. For t ∈σ (µ)
n
(µ ≥1) the above error equation can be written as
eh(t) = Eµ(t) + δh(t) +

If the given functions in (4.3.1) have continuous derivatives of at least order
m on their respective domains, the global convergence and order analysis can
be based again on the (local) representation of the collocation error by means
of the Peano Kernel Theorem: in analogy to the approach in Section 2.2.4 we
now have

m,n(v) is
obvious from (2.2.30), (2.2.31) in the proof of Theorem 2.2.3.
In order to obtain an estimate for eh on (t0, ξ1] we can resort directly
to the proof of Theorem 2.2.3: a trivial change in the notation yields

||E(0)

lows that
||eh||0,∞:= sup
t∈I (0) |eh(t)| ≤C0(h(0))m
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1).
A simple induction argument, employing the estimates for the terms Eµ(t) on
I (µ) in (4.3.22), together with the observation that by the conditions (D1)–(D3)
for the lag function θ the number (M + 1) of macro-intervals I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1]
is ﬁnite, yields the results summarised in the following theorem.
Theorem 4.3.2 Assume
(a) The given functions g, K1, K2 and φ in (4.3.1) all possess continuous
derivatives of order m on their respective domains.
(b) The lag function θ(t) = t −τ(t) is subject to the conditions (D1)–(D3) of
Section 4.2.1, with d ≥m in (D1).
(c) uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is the collocation solution to (4.3.1) corresponding to a θ-
invariant mesh Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h), with ¯h deﬁned in Theorem 4.3.1.
Then for any set of collocation parameters {ci : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1} the
collocation error eh := y −uh has the property that
||eh||∞:= sup
t∈(t0,T ]
|eh(t)| ≤Chm.
(4.3.25)
The constant C depends on the {ci} but not on h := max(n,µ) h(µ)
n .
Not surprisingly, the global superconvergence result of Theorem 2.2.5 for
the iterated collocation solution uit
h remains valid in the case of second-kind
Volterra integral equations with non-vanishing delays.
Theorem 4.3.3 Suppose that the assumptions (a)–(c) of Theorem 4.3.2 hold,
but with m + 1 replacing m in (a) and (b). If the collocation parameters {ci}
are chosen so that the orthogonality condition

We now adapt the techniques employed in the proofs of Theorem 1.1.3 (cf.
(1.1.39) and (1.1.40)) and Theorem 2.2.5 ((2.2.40), (2.2.41)) to (4.3.27). The
integrals over subintervals [t(v), t(v)
l+1] can then be replaced by the sum of an
interpolatory m-point quadrature formula with respect to the collocation points
in that interval and the corresponding quadrature error. The expression given
by the quadrature formula has value zero, since δh(t) = 0 for t ∈Xh. Due to
the assumed regularity of the data (which is inherited on D by the resolvent
R1 and piecewise on I and D, respectively, by the defect δh and the functions
Rµ,ν, Qµ,ν), the orthogonality condition (4.3.26) implies that all quadrature
errors are O(hm+1).
It remains to deal with the integrals

R1(t, s)δh(s)ds
and
 θµ−ν(t)

(recall from (4.2.3), following the deﬁnition of a θ-invariant mesh, that
θµ−ν(t) ∈σ (ν)
n
if t ∈σ (µ)
n ). It is easily veriﬁed (using the global convergence
result of Theorem 4.3.2 and (4.3.21)) that ||δh||∞= O(hm). Thus, in the esti-
mation of the above integrals (via the usual scaling) the uniform estimate for
δh is multiplied by h, leading to the required O(hm+1)-term in Theorem 4.3.3.
Corollary 4.3.4 In the particular delay integral equation (4.3.15) assume that
g ∈Cm+1(I) and K ∈Cm+1( ¯Dθ), with ¯Dθ := {(t, s) : θ(t) ≤s ≤t, t ∈I},
and let the delay function θ satisfy (D1)–(D3) with d ≥m + 1. Then the iterated
collocation solution based on uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) and deﬁned by (4.3.20) has the
global superconvergence property
||y −uit
h ||∞≤Chm+1
provided the mesh Ih is θ-invariant, the {ci} underlying the set Xh of collocation
points satisfy J0 = 0 (cf. (4.3.26)), and φ ∈Cm+1[θ(t0), t0].

4.3.3 Local superconvergence results
The proof of the global superconvergence result in Theorem 4.3.3 indicates
that we can readily modify it – as we have already seen in Section 2.2.5 when
we established local superconvergence results for classical Volterra integral
equations of the second kind – to obtain the ‘non-vanishing delay analogues’ of
Theorem 2.2.6 and Corollaries 2.2.7–2.2.9. The key to the proofs of these results
is once more the variation-of-constants formula of Theorem 4.1.2, evaluated at
t = t(µ)
n
∈Ih.
Theorem 4.3.5 Let the given functions g, K1, K2 and φ in the delay integral
equation (4.3.1) have continuous derivatives of order m + κ in their respective
domains I, D, Dθ and [θ(t0), t0], and assume that the delay function θ is
subject to the conditions (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.2.1, with d ≥m + κ in (D1).
If uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) denotes the collocation solution, for a θ-invariant mesh Ih,
with corresponding iterated collocation solution uit
h , and if the collocation
parameters are so that the orthogonality conditions (2.2.42),
Jν :=

(0 ≤ν ≤κ −1),
hold, with Jκ ̸= 0, then
max
t∈Ih\{t0} |y(t) −uit
h | ≤Chm+κ
is true whenever h ∈(0, ¯h).
If, in addition, we have cm = 1 (implying κ < m), then uh itself exhibits local
superconvergence at the mesh points:
max
t∈Ih\{t0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Chm+κ.
Proof Our starting point is (4.3.27) in the proof of Theorem 4.3.3 where we
now set t = t(µ)
n . Hence,

(cf. (4.2.3)). Hence, the by
now rather familiar quadrature argument is applicable: since the defect δh van-
ishes on Xh, and since the orthogonality and regularity conditions imply that
the quadrature errors induced by the interpolatory m-point quadrature formu-
las based on the {ci} are all of order O(hm+κ), with the number M + 1 of

230
4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
macro-intervals I (µ) being ﬁnite, the ﬁrst assertion in Theorem 4.3.4 follows
immediately.
The second assertion is based on the fact that when cm = 1, each mesh
point t(µ)
n
(1 ≤n ≤N) is a collocation point and thus uit
h (t(µ)
n ) = uh(t(µ)
n ), since
δh(t(µ)
n ) = 0. Note also that eit
h (t0) = 0 because uit
h (t0) = y(t+
0 ).
Corollary 4.3.6 Assumeκ = m inTheorem4.3.4.Thencollocationin S(−1)
m−1(Ih)
at the Gauss points leads to an iterated collocation solution with the property
that
max
t∈Ih |y(t) −uit
h (t)| ≤Ch2m,
while
max
t∈Ih\{t0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Chm
only.
Corollary 4.3.7 Suppose that κ = m −1 and cm = 1. The optimal order of
convergence of the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) corresponding to the
Radau II points is then given by
max
t∈Ih\{t0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Ch2m−1.
Recall that we have uit
h (t) = uh(t) for t ∈Ih\{t0} whenever cm = 1 (i.e. when
tn ∈Xh, n = 1, . . . , N).
We illustrate these results by an example:
Example 4.3.1 Non-vanishing proportional delay
On I = [t0, T ] with t0 > 0, the delay function θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1) corre-
sponds to a non-vanishing delay τ(t) since
θ(t) = qt = t −(1 −q)t =: t −τ(t),
with τ(t) ≥(1 −q)t0 > 0 for t ∈I. Hence, the primary discontinuity points
{ξµ} are given by
ξµ = q−µt0
(µ ≥0).
We will assume, for ease of exposition and without loss of generality, that T is
such that ξM+1 = T for some M > 1. Hence, we may write
ξµ = q M+1−µT,
µ = 0, 1, . . . , M + 1.
Suppose that the mesh Ih is constrained, and let each local mesh I (µ)
h
be uniform:
I (µ)
h
:= {t(µ)
n
:= ξµ + nh(µ) : n = 0, 1, . . . , N (h(µ) = q−(µ+1)(1 −q)t0/N)}.

A mesh of this type is often called a quasi-geometric mesh (see also Section
5.5.3). The linearity of θ then implies that Ih is θ-invariant, and the same is true
for the set Xh of collocation points.
This choice of the local meshes deﬁning Ih implies that
h = h(M) = 1
N (ξM+1 −ξM) = (1 −q) T
N ,
and
h(µ) = 1
N (ξµ+1 −ξµ) = q M+1−µ−1(1 −q) T
N
(µ = 0, 1, . . . , M).
The result of, e.g. Theorem 4.3.5 then becomes
max
t∈Ih\{t0} |y(t) −uit
h (t)| ≤C(q)N −(m+κ).
Note that this result also holds for the delay VIE (4.3.15),
y(t) = g(t) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈I := [t0, T ] (t0 > 0),
with θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1).
We shall return to this example in Section 5.5.3 when we describe collocation
on quasi-geometric meshes for VIDEs with vanishing delays.
4.3.4 Nonlinear delay VIEs
We turn to the nonlinear version of (4.3.1),
y(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.3.28)
where now
(Vy)(t) :=
 t
t0
k1(t, s, y(s))ds,
(Vθ y)(t) :=
 θ(t)
t0
k2(t, s, y(s))ds.
(4.3.29)
The computational form of the collocation equation for uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is readily
obtained by adapting (4.3.10), and thus we will not write it down in detail.
Instead, we focus on the particular nonlinear delay VIE
y(t) = g(t) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.3.30)
where we assume that the Volterra operator Wθ is now of Hammerstein type,
(Wθ y)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)
k(t −s)G(s, y(s))ds.
(4.3.31)
As we have already seen in Section 2.3.3, there are two ways of generat-
ing collocation approximations to solutions of Volterra–Hammerstein integral

232
4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
equations of the second kind. In the ‘direct’ approach we approximate y by
uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), followed by the iterated collocation solution uit
h based on uh.
The equations deﬁning these approximations are the nonlinear analogues of
those in (4.3.18), namely,

The local representation of uh on σ (µ)

is again described by (4.3.4).

(4.3.34)
Here, ¯(µ−1)
n
(t) is the nonlinear counterpart of (4.3.17).
Alternatively, we can resort to what we called implicitly linear collocation
in Section 2.3.3. Setting z(t) := G(t, y(t)) (recall the Niemytzki operator intro-
duced at the end of Section 2.1.5), the nonlinear delay VIE (4.3.30) becomes
an implicitly linear delay VIE for z,
z(t) = G

t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.3.35)
with initial condition z(t) = G(t, φ(t)), t ∈[θ(t0), t0]. The solution of the orig-
inal DVIE is then obtained via the recursion
y(t) = g(t) + (Lθz)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.3.36)
where Lθ denotes the linear delay Volterra operator
(Lθ y)(t) :=
 t

The solution z of (4.3.35) will be approximated by zh ∈S(−1)

In this section we will study the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)

4.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with delays
235
As we have observed before, an important special case of (4.4.1) is
(Wθ y)(t) = g(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.4.6)
with given y(t) = φ(t) on the initial interval [θ(t0), t0]. The kernel K of the
integral operator
(Wθ y)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)
K(t, s)y(s)ds
is assumed to satisfy the hypotheses stated in Theorem 4.1.4.
Since we have already done our homework in Section 4.3.1, the computa-
tional form of the collocation equation
(Wθuh)(t) = g(t),
t ∈Xh,
(4.4.7)
with initial values given by uh(t) = φ(t), t ∈[θ(t0), t0], derives immediately

Remark In Example 4.3.1 we considered the lag function θ(t) = qt (0 < q <
1) on I = [t0, T ] with t0 > 0. The corresponding delay τ(t) = (1 −q)t does
not vanish on I. Consider the delay equation
(Wθ y)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I
(g(0) = 0),
where the kernel K in W and the function g are such that it possesses a unique
solution y ∈Cd(I) for some d ≥1. Suppose that y is approximated by the col-

m−1(Ih), with Ih being the θ-invariant (quasi-geometric)
mesh of Example 4.3.1.

imply the uniform convergence of uh to y on I, as N →∞? The answer to this
question remains to be found (see Exercise 4.7.13).
4.4.2 Direct versus indirect collocation
We know from Section 2.4.4 that local superconvergence at the mesh points is
not possible in collocation solutions for ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equations,
and that hence it is often advantageous to use its differentiated form (a VIE of
the second kind) as the basis for generating high-order solutions. The same is
true for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with non-vanishing delays θ. Thus, if the given functions
in (4.4.1) satisfy the conditions in Theorem 4.1.4, differentiation of both sides
of the given equation yields the delay integral equation
y(t) = f (t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + ( ˜Wθ y)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
(4.4.10)
where we have introduced the functions f (t) := g′(t)/K(t, t),
b(t) := −K(t, θ(t))θ′(t)/K(t, t),
H(t, s) := −[∂K(t, s)/∂t]/K(t, t),
and the Volterra integral operator
( ˜Wθ y)(t) := −
 t
θ(t)
H(t, s)y(s)ds.
Thus, instead of the given ﬁrst-kind integral equation (5.4.1) we solve (4.4.5)
by collocation in S(−1)
m−1(Ih), with θ-invariant mesh Ih:
uh(t) = f (t) + b(t)uh(θ(t)) + ( ¯Wθuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(4.4.11)
with uh(t) = φ(t) when t ∈[θ(t0), t0]. Since the delay function θ does not van-
ish on I, the result of Theorem 4.3.1 on the existence of a unique collocation
solution uh carries over to the more general equation (4.4.11). Hence, the it-
erated collocation solution for (4.4.1) corresponding to the unique ‘indirect’
collocation solution uh is obtained from
uit
h (t) := f (t) + b(t)uh(θ(t)) + ( ¯Wθuh(t),
t ∈(t0, T ].

4.5 Collocation for VIDEs with delays
237
Theorem 4.4.1 Suppose that the functions deﬁning the ﬁrst-kind delay Volterra
integral equation (4.4.1) satisfy, for d ≥m + κ:
(a) K ∈Cd+1( ¯Dθ);
(b) g ∈Cd+1(I);
(c) θ ∈Cd+1(I), and θ subject to the conditions (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.2.1;
(d) φ ∈Cd+1[θ(t0), t0].
If the collocation points Xh are deﬁned by the Gauss points {ci}, then the
‘indirect’ iterated collocation solution uit
h corresponding to uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), with
θ-invariant mesh Ih, and deﬁned by (4.4.11), has the superconvergence prop-
erties
||y −uit
h ||∞≤Chm+1
(if κ = 1),
(4.4.12)
and
max
t∈Ih\{t0} |y(t) −uit
h (t)| ≤Ch2m
(if κ = m).
(4.4.13)
If the collocation parameters are the Radau II points (κ = m −1) then uh itself
is superconvergent on Ih \ {t0}:
max
t∈Ih\{t0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Ch2m−1.
Proof We leave it as Exercise 4.7.12.
4.5 Collocation for VIDEs with delays
4.5.1 The exact collocation equations
The description and analysis of collocation methods in Chapters 1 and 3, and
in the previous sections of the present chapter, have introduced all the ideas
required to deal with collocation solutions for the initial-value problem
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t))) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I := [t0, T ],
(4.5.1)
y(t) = φ(t),
t ∈[θ(t0), t0],
with Volterra integral operators V and Vθ given by (4.3.29) or by their linear
counterparts in (4.3.1). The delay function θ will again be assumed to sat-
isfy conditions (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.1. Therefore, the collocation equation
deﬁning uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) in the subinterval ¯σ (µ)
n
of the θ-invariant mesh Ih is
uh(t) = f (t, uh(t), uh(θ(t))) + (Vuh(t) + (Vθuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,

functions θ be subject to the hypotheses (D1)–(D3) in Section 4.1.2. Then there
exists a ¯h > 0 so that for any θ-invariant mesh Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h) and any initial
function φ ∈C[θ(t0), t0] each of the linear algebraic systems (4.5.8) possesses a
unique solution Y (µ)
n
∈IRm. Therefore, the collocation equation (4.5.2) deﬁnes a

unique collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for (4.5.7) whose local representation
on ¯σ (µ)
n
is given by (4.5.5).
4.5.2 Global convergence results
Let eh := y −uh denote the collocation error for the collocation solution uh ∈
S(0)
m (Ih) to the linear version (4.5.7) of the delay VIDE (4.5.1), where Ih is the
θ-invariant mesh deﬁned in (4.2.1), (4.2.2). It obviously solves the initial-value
problem
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + b(t)eh(θ(t)) + δh(t) + (Veh)(t) + (Vθeh)(t),
t ∈I,
(4.5.9)
eh(t) = 0 on [θ(t0), t0], where the defect δh vanishes on Xh, the set of collocation
points. For t ∈I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1] we write the above error equation in the form
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + δh(t) + Gµ(t) +
 t
ξµ
K1(t, s)eh(s)ds,
t ∈I (µ), (4.5.10)
with given initial value eh(ξµ) and lag term
Gµ(t) := b(t)eh(θ(t)) +
 ξµ
t0
K1(t, s)eh(s)ds + (Vθeh)(t).
When µ = 0 we have
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + δh(t) +
 t
t0
K1(t, s)eh(s)ds,
t ∈I (0),
(4.5.11)
since the initial condition eh(t) = 0, t ≤0 implies G0(t) = 0 in [θ(t0), t0].
Hence, on the ﬁrst macro-interval I (0) the gobal convergence result of The-
orem 3.2.1 for classical VIDEs holds: under appropriate assumptions on the
regularity of the solution (see Theorem 4.5.1 below) the collocation error can
be estimated by
||e(ν)
h ||0,∞:= sup
t∈I (0) |e(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cν(h(0))m
(ν = 0, 1).
This implies in particular that e(ν)
h (ξ1) = O((h(0))m).
An analogous global error estimate can now be derived on each subsequent
macro-interval I (µ) (1 ≤µ ≤M), by applying the global convergence esti-
mates of Section 3.2.3 to the VIDE (4.5.10) on I (µ). We leave these obvious
details to the reader and simply summarise the result in
Theorem 4.5.2 Assume:
(a) a, b, g ∈Cm(I), and φ ∈Cm+1[θ(t0), t0];

4.5 Collocation for VIDEs with delays
241
(b) K1 ∈Cm(D), K2 ∈Cm(Dθ);
(c) θ satisﬁes the conditions (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.2, with d ≥m in (D1);
(d) uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the collocation solution to the delay VIDE (4.5.7), where
Ih is θ-invariant and h ∈(0, ¯h) so that the linear algebraic systems (4.5.8)
all have unique solutions.
Then the estimates
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cνhm
(ν = 0, 1)
(4.5.12)
hold for any set {ci} of distinct collocation parameters in [0, 1]. The constants
Cν depend on these parameters but are independent of h.
Since the delay τ in the VIDE (4.5.1) does not vanish on I, a gain of one
can be achieved in the global order of convergence of uh by a judicious choice
of the {ci}, thus extending the global superconvergence result of Theorem 3.2.5
for classical VIDEs.
Theorem 4.5.3 Let the assumed degree of regularity for the given functions in
the initial-value problem for the linear delay VIDE (4.5.7) be raised by one (to
m + 1 and m + 2, respectively) in Theorem 4.5.1. If the collocation parameters
satisfy the orthogonality condition
J0 :=
 1
0
m

i=1
(s −ci)ds = 0
then for all θ-invariant meshes Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h), the collocation solution
uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is globally superconvergent on I:
||y −uh||∞≤Chm+1,
(4.5.13)
with C depending on the {ci} but not on h.
Proof The key to establishing this global superconvergence result (and the
local superconvergence results in the next section) is the variation-of-constants
formula of Theorem 4.1.7, where y and g are replaced, respectively, by eh
and δh, and where the initial condition is given by eh(t) = 0 (t ≤t0). It is then
easy to show that eh(ξµ) = O((h(µ))m+1) (1 ≤µ ≤M; h(µ) ≤h), by applying
Theorem 3.2.5 on each of the macro-intervals I (µ). Note that, as discussed in
detail in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 (proof of Theorem 4.3.3), the image of a
point t = t(µ)
n
+ vh(µ)
n
∈σ (µ)
n
under θµ−ν (0 ≤ν ≤µ −1) is given either by
t(ν)

(v ∈[0, 1]) if θ is linear, or by t(ν)
n
+ ˜vh(ν)
n
(for some ˜v ∈[0, 1],
with ˜v ̸= v) if θ is nonlinear.
The remaining details of the proof are left as an exercise.

4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
Remark The convergence results of Theorems 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 contain, as spe-
cial cases, global convergence and superconvergence results for DDEs (corre-
sponding to Ki = 0 on D and Dθ, respectively).
4.5.3 Local superconvergence results
In the previous section we have brieﬂy described the foundation for proving op-
timal superconvergence results on Ih for the collocation solution uh ∈Sm((0)(Ih)
to the linear delay VIDE (4.5.7): it is given by the variation-of-constants for-
mula (or ‘resolvent representation’) for the collocation error eh := y −uh de-
rived from Theorem 4.1.7 The essential ingredients of the proof of the local
superconvergence result are thus all in place: the θ-invariance of the mesh
Ih and the resulting mapping (4.2.2) of mesh points t(µ)
n
into corresponding
previous mesh points t(ν)
n
(which is of course true regardless of whether the
delay function θ is linear or nonlinear) and the order of the quadrature errors
corresponding to the interpolatory m-point quadrature formulas based on the
collocation points and depending on the familiar orthogonality conditions for
the collocation parameters {ci}. Thus, without any more ado we state
Theorem 4.5.4 Assume:
(a) The given functions a, b, g and K1, K2 in the DVIDE (4.5.7) are in Cm+κ
on their respective domains, for some κ with 1 ≤κ ≤m, as speciﬁed in
(d).
(b) The lag function θ is subject to (D1)–(D3) in Section 4.2.1, with d ≥m +
κ + 1 in (D1).
(c) uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the collocation solution, with θ-invariant mesh Ih, for the
delay VIDE (4.5.7).
(d) The collocation parameters {ci} are such that the orthogonality conditions
(3.2.39),
Jν :=

m

i=1
(s −ci)ds = 0,
ν = 0, 1, . . . , κ −1,
with Jκ ̸= 0, hold.
Then, for all sufﬁciently small h (i.e. h ∈(0, ¯h)) the collocation error eh :=
y −uh satisﬁes
max
t∈Ih |eh(t)| ≤Chm+κ
(4.5.14)
for some constant C which depends on the {ci} but not on h.

4.5 Collocation for VIDEs with delays

If, in addition, cm = 1 (implying κ ≤m −1), then we also have

t∈Ih\{t0} |e′
h(t)| ≤C1hm+κ.

4.5.4 Neutral VFIDEs
InSection4.1.4weintroducedtwoclassesofneutralVolterrafunctionalintegro-
differential equations, namely
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t)), y′(θ(t))) + (V′y)(t) + (V′
θ y)(t)
(4.5.16)
where the kernels of V′ and V′
θ depend also on y′(s), and
d
dt [y(t) −(Vθ y)(t)] = F(t, y(t), y(θ(t)))
(4.5.17)
with
(Vθ y)(t) :=
 θ(t)
t0
k(t, s, y(s))ds.
Since the global and local (super-) convergence properties of collocation so-
lutions uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to (4.5.16) can be derived along the lines of the ones for
the ‘classical’ neutral VIDEs we considered in Section 3.2.6 (see also Brunner
(1994b) for the case of constant delay τ > 0), we leave their derivation as an
exercise (Exercise 4.7.14) and focus instead on collocation methods for (4.5.17)
and the corresponding initial-value problem introduced in (4.1.48),
z′(t) = H(t, z(t), y(θ(t)),
t ∈I := [t0, T ],
(4.5.18)
z(t0) = 0 := φ(t0) −(Vθφ)(t0),
where
z(t) := y(t) −(Vθ y)(t)
and
H(t, z, w) := F(t, z + Vθ y, w).
The solution to (4.5.17) is then obtained from
y(t) = z(t) + (Vθz)(t),
t ∈I
(see also Brunner and Vermiglio (2003)).
Suppose that the solution z of the initial-value problem (4.5.18) is approxi-
mated by the collocation solution zh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) where Ih is a θ-invariant mesh
on I:
z′
h(t) = H(t, zh(t), yh(θ(t))),
t ∈Xh;
zh(t0) = 0.
(4.5.19)

244
4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
The induced approximation yh to the solution y of the original problem (4.5.17)
is then determined by
yh(t) := zh(t) + (Vθ yh)(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(4.5.20)
On the ﬁrst macro-interval I (0) := [ξ0, ξ1], with ξ0 = t0, the above equations
reduce to
z′
h(t) = H(t, z(t), φ(θ(t))),
t ∈X(0)

and

The convergence analysis is straightforward because it can be based on

4.6 Functional equations with state-dependent delays
245
(4.5.19): since zh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) approximates the solution of a delay differential
equation, we know that
||z −zh||∞≤Chm+1
holds if the {ci} satisfy the orthogonality condition J0 = 0 (cf. Theorem 4.5.3).
Also, we have
max
t∈Ih |z(t) −zh(t)| ≤Ch2m,
provided Jν = 0 (ν = 0, 1, . . . , m −1) (Theorem 4.5.4). It is then easy to show
that the same order results are true for the approximation yh to the solution y
of (4.5.17): this follows from
|(Vθ y)(t) −(Vθ yh)(t)| ≤
 θ(t)
0
|K2(t, s)| · |y(s) −yh(s)|ds,
t ∈I,
and the estimate
|y(t) −yh(t)| ≤|z(t) −zh(t)|,
t ∈I.
Here, we have used the fact that y(t) = yh(t) = φ(t), t ≤t0, where φ is the
given initial function.
Remark When solving neutral delay VIDEs (or neutral DDEs), for example
the analogue of problem (4.5.17)),
d
dt [y(t) −(Vθ y)(t)] = F(t, y(t), t(θ(t), y′(θ(t))),
it is desirable to have high-order approximations to y(t) and its derivative y′(t)
on Ih. In this case the use of the Radau II points as the collocation parameters
deﬁning Xh is to be preferred over the Gauss points. The resulting order of local
superconvergence on Ih is then p∗= 2m −1, both for yh and y′
h.
4.6 Functional equations with state-dependent delays
4.6.1 DDEs with state-dependent delays
The numerical analysis of DDEs with state-dependent delays is now quite well
understood. The pioneering papers by Neves and Feldstein (1976) and Feldstein
and Neves (1984), as well as those by, e.g. Neves (1975a, 1975b), Neves and
Thompson (1992) (with many examples and additional references), Will´e and
Baker (1994), Karoui and Vaillancourt (1994), Hartung and Turi (1995), Gy¨ori,
Hartung and Turi (1995), Hartung, Herdman and Turi (1997), Gy¨ori, Hartung

246
4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
and Turi (1998), and the monograph by Bellen and Zennaro (2003, pp. 30–32)
convey a good picture of its development and current state of the art.
4.6.2 Collocation for VIEs and VIDEs with
state-dependent delays
For Volterra functional differential systems with state-dependent delays (which
include integro-differential equations with such delays) we have the substantial
work by Tavernini (1978) on general one-step methods. It also contains some
superconvergence results. The numerical solution of second-kind Volterra inte-
gral equations with state-dependent delays was studied by Cahlon and Nachman
(1985) and Cahlon (1992).
However, except for the results in Cryer and Tavernini (1972) (Euler’s
method may be viewed as a simple collocation method) the general (super-)
convergence analysis for piecewise collocation methods is still outstanding. For
example, we do not know if the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
1 (Ih) for DVIDEs
of the form
y′(t) = g(t) +
 t
t−τ(y(t))
k(t −s)G(y(s))ds
(i.e. the VIDE analogue of (4.1.36)) exhibits O(h2)-superconvergence if collo-
cation is based on the Gauss point c1 = 1/2. We are similarly ignorant about
the optimal order of convergence on Ih for uit
h corresponding to the colloca-
tion solution uh ∈S(−1)
0
(Ih) for B´elair’s state-dependent delay integral equation
(4.1.36).
The major obstacle in these still missing analyses is of course the fact that
now the location of the primary discontinuity points {ξµ} is not known a priori
since these points depend on the unknown solution of the functional equation.
The problem of tracking the {ξµ} is addressed in Neves and Feldstein (1976),
Feldstein and Neves (1984), Neves and Thompson (1992), and Will´e and Baker
(1994).SeealsoBellenandZennaro(2003)foragoodexpositionoftheseresults
for DDEs. The same problem is discussed in Brunner and Zhang (1999); they
also analyse the regularity of solutions to VIEs and VIDEs with state-dependent
delays (extending the techniques due to Feldstein and Neves). The exploitation
of these results in collocation methods remains open.

4.8 Notes
4.1: Basic theory of Volterra equations with delays (I)
Variation-of-constants formulas for DDEs (including neutral equations) can
be found for example in the books by Hale (1977), Hale and Verduyn Lunel
(1993), and Diekmann et al. (1995). The paper by Cerha (1976) presents various
variation-of-constants formulas and related solution representations for second-
kind VIEs with variable delays; while Corduneau (1989) establishes analogous
results for abstract Volterra differential equations.
An important early paper on nonlinear delay VIEs is Nohel and Levin (1964)
(see also Ford, Baker and Roberts (1998)). The analysis of such functional
equations received considerable momentum from the study of mathematical
models of biological growth processes: see, e.g. Cooke (1976), Cooke and
Kaplan (1976), Hethcote, Lewis and van den Driessche (1989), and Hethcote
and van den Driessche (2000) (also for additional references).
The papers by Cahlon, Nachman and Schmidt (1984), Cahlon (1990, 1995b)
and Cahlon and Schmidt (1997) deal, in addition to numerical solutions, with
various aspects of the theory of delay VIEs of the second kind. Compare also
Cahlon and Dentz (2000) for related results. A more general stability analysis
can be found in Luzyanina, Roose and Engelborghs (2003). DVIEs with state-
dependent delays are discussed in Cahlon and Nachman (1985) and Cahlon
(1992).
Results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to (nonlinear) delay
VIEs of the ﬁrst kind can be found in Meis (1978). See also Esser (1976, 1978)
for related results for second-kind DVIEs.
The regularity of solutions to functional differential and integral equations
was studied in Neves and Feldstein (1976) (DDEs with state-dependent delays),
de Gee (1985), Will´e and Baker (1992), Baker and Paul (1997), and in Brunner
and Zhang (1999) and Ma (2004) (DVIDEs). The papers by Tavernini (1971)
and by Cryer and Tavernini (1972) contain results on the solvability of gen-
eral Volterra functional differential equations. We also point out the important
contribution by Kappel and Kunisch (1987) on invariance results for delay and
Volterra functional equations.
Applications of Volterra functional equations
As we have already seen brieﬂy in Section 4.1.5, one of the principal sources
of DDEs and, especially, Volterra integral and integro-differential equations
with constant or more general non-vanishing delays is the mathematical mod-
elling in population dynamics, with Volterra’s pioneering work of the late 1920s
marking its beginning. Many basic (early) mathematical models in epidemi-
ology and population growth are described in, e.g. Waltman (1974), Cooke

(1976), Smith (1977), and Busenberg and Cooke (1980). The monographs by
Volterra (1931), Volterra and d’Ancona (1935), Cushing (1977), Webb (1985),
Kuang (1993), Wu (1996) (partial functional differential equations), Brauer and
Castillo-Ch´avez (2001), and Zhao (2003) contain a wealth of material on the
theory and application of population models, as do the proceedings edited by
Schmitt (1972), Metz and Diekmann (1986) (especially Chapter IV), and Ruan,
Wolkowicz and Wu (2003), and the survey papers by Cooke and Yorke (1973),
Busenberg and Cooke (1980), Ruan and Wu (1994), Bocharov and Rihan
(2000), and Brauer and van den Driessche (2003) (the last two papers fea-

are the papers by Volterra (1927, 1928, 1934, 1939), Cooke (1976), Cooke
and Kaplan (1976), Smith (1977), Hethcote and Tudor (1980), Hethcote et
al. (1989), Ca˜nada and Zertiti (1994), Hethcote and van den Driessche (1995,
2000). In addition, the reader may ﬁnd it worthwhile to look at Tychonoff
(1938) (for early applications of Volterra functional equations), Corduneanu
and Lakshmikantham (1980) (on functional equations with unbounded delays),
Ruan and Wu (1994) (on non-standard Volterra integro-differential equations),
and Thieme and Zhao (2003), not least because of the numerous additional
references contained in these papers.

delay VIEs and VIDEs can be found in Marshall (1979), Lakshmikantham

4.2: Collocation for DDEs: a review
The monograph by Bellen and Zennaro (2003) gives a comprehensive account
of numerical methods for DDEs, with the focus being on (classical and con-
tinuous) Runge–Kutta methods and their asymptotic stability properties. Early
papers on the subject are by Bellman (1961), Bellman and Cooke (1965). The
papers by Torelli (1989) and Zennaro (1993) are landmarks in the analysis of
contractivity of Rung–Kutta approximations to DDEs (but see also Reverdy

(1981, 1990) for closely related results). Related stability results were derived
bynumerousauthors;weciteBellenandZennaro(1992),Zennaro(1993,1997),
Bellen (1997), Bellen, Guglielmi and Zennaro (1999), and Torelli and Vermiglio
(2003).
The important question of delay-dependent stability was answered by
Guglielmi (1998, 2000, 2001); see also Guglielmi and Hairer (2001a, 2001b).
In order to obtain an impression of the development of the numerical analy-
sis of DDEs and related functional equations, the reader may wish to consult
the surveys by Cryer (1972), Bellen (1985), Jackiewicz and Kwapisz (1991),
Zennaro (1995) and Baker (1997).
Bellen (1984) established the local superconvergence results of collocation
methods (for the Gauss points) for nonlinear DDEs with non-vanishing delays;
see also Vermiglio (1985) and Zennaro (1985, 1986, 1988).
Collocation methods for functional differential equations with periodic so-
lutions were studied in Bellen (1979) and, more recently, in Engelborghs,
Luzyanina, in ’t Hout and Roose (2000) and Engelborghs and Doedel
(2002).
4.3: Collocation for second-kind VIEs with delays
The superconvergence analysis of collocation and iterated collocation solutions
for linear second-kind VIEs with constant delays is due to Brunner (1994a). It
was extended to nonlinear equations in Brunner (1992a). Related convergence
results may be found in Hu (1997c, 1999).
The asymptotic stability of collocation solutions for delay VIEs (with con-
stant delays) was studied by Vermiglio (1992). As we mentioned in the Pref-
ace, the stability properties of numerical methods for Volterra integral and
more general functional equations are not yet well understood. Stability anal-
yses for some classes of numerical methods for (special) delay VIEs can be
found Cahlon (1990, 1995a, 1995b), Cahlon and Dentz (1992), and Cahlon
and Schmidt (1997, 2000); see also Tian and Kuang (1995). A more general
approach is given in Luzyanina, Roose and Engelborghs (2003).
4.4: Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with delays:
Brunner (1999b) uses the integrated form of the neutral functional equation
(d/dt)[(Wθ y)(t)] = f (t) (with θ(t) = t −τ) to generate piecewise polynomial
solutions and prove corresponding superconvergence results.
4.5: Collocation for VIDEs with delays
Collocation methods for VIDEs with constant delays were studied by Brunner
(1994b). These superconvergence results were extended to VIDEs with non-
vanishing proportional (and more general) delays in Brunner, Bellen, Maset
and Torelli (2002).

252
4 Initial-value problems with non-vanishing delays
Brunner and Vermiglio (2003) analyse continuous Runge-Kutta and collo-
cation methods for delay VIDEs in ‘Hale’s form’; the focus of the analysis is on
contractivitypropertiesoftheaproximatesolutions.Adifferentapproach(based
on the integrated form of the neutral Volterra integro-differential equation) is
studied in Brunner (1999b).
The papers by Kappel and Kunisch (1982) and Ito and Kappel (1989) are
concerned with spline approximation methods to neutral functional differential
equations and Volterra functional equations with inﬁnite delay, respectively.
The basis for these methods is the semigroup framework generated by the
given functional equations (see also the Notes to Chapter 7, and the monograph
by Ito and Kappel (2002)).

Initial-value problems with proportional
(vanishing) delays
Delay differential equations and Volterra functional equations with smooth
data and proportional delays that vanish at the left endpoint of their interval of
integration I = [0, T ] possess smooth solutions on I. However, the supercon-
vergence analysis of collocation solutions to functional equations with these
seemingly ‘innocent’ delays is much more complex, not least due to the fact
that variation-of-constants formulas for the representation of their solutions do
no longer exist. A thorough understanding of the numerical analysis of these
functional equations will be crucial when dealing with more general problems
including vanishing delays.
5.1 Basic theory of functional equations with
proportional delays
5.1.1 Volterra’s 1897 paper and some early history
In the ﬁrst Nota of his 1896 papers Volterra had studied and solved the problem
of ‘inverting’ deﬁnite integrals of the form
(Vy)(t) :=
 t
0
K(t, s)y(s)ds = g(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
g(0) = 0,
where K ∈C(D). He then turned his attention to the more general inversion
problem in which the lower limit of integration in the Volterra integral operator
is also variable. In particular he considered the delay equation
(Wθ y)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I,
g(0) = 0,
(5.1.1)
253

254
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
where the Volterra integral operator Wθ is deﬁned by
(Wθφ)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)
K(t, s)φ(s)ds,
with θ(t) := qt (0 < q < 1).
(5.1.2)
He gave a complete answer to this question in Volterra (1897), by adapting the
techniques he used in Nota I (1896a) to this new, and very different, situation.
Under suitable conditions on K and g (similar to those in Theorem 2.1.8) this
equation can be transformed into the equivalent second-kind equation
K(t, t)y(t) −qK(t, qt)y(qt) +
 t
qt
∂K(t, s)
∂t
y(s)ds = g′(t),
t ∈I. (5.1.3)
(see also Brunner (1997b)). This reformulation is the basis for Volterra’s 1897
result which we state below. We set ¯Dθ := {(t, s) : 0 ≤θ(t) ≤s ≤t ≤T }.
Theorem 5.1.1 Assume:
(a) g ∈C1(I), with g(0) = 0;
(b) K ∈C( ¯Dθ), ∂K/∂t ∈C( ¯Dθ), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 for all t ∈I.
Then for each θ(t) = qt with q ∈(0, 1) the ﬁrst-kind delay integral equation
(5.1.1) possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I).
Proof Volterra starts the proof by the following observation (Volterra (1897,
pp. 156–157). Suppose that the given (real-valued) functions λ and ϕ are con-
tinuous on I, with |λ(0)| ≤1, and consider the inﬁnite series
θ(t) := ϕ(t) +
∞

j=1
α j
 j−1

l=0
λ(αlt)

ϕ(α jt),
t ∈I.
This series converges uniformly on I, and hence its limit θ lies in C(I). On the
other hand, if θ ∈C[0, T ] is given, then replacing t in the above equation by αt
and then multiplying by αλ(x) readily leads to an expression for the unknown
function ϕ,
θ(t) −αλ(t)θ(αt) = ϕ(t),
t ∈I.
In other words, these two equations are reciprocal to each other. This obser-
vation was then used by Volterra to establish the desired result for the delay
integral equation (5.1.2) in a rather elegant way. We shall encounter the second
functional equation again later, in Section 5.3.4; see also Liu (1995b).
Volterra’s analysis – which relies on Picard iteration techniques – was ex-
tended by Lalesco (1908, 1911) (see also Volterra (1913, pp. 92–101) and Feny¨o

5.1 Basic theory of functional equations with proportional delays
255
and Stolle (1984, pp. 324–327)) to ﬁrst-kind integral equations with more gen-
eral vanishing delays.
We note in passing that the above result was generalised by, among others,
Lalesco (1908, 1911), and more recently by Denisov and Korovin (1992) and
by Denisov and Lorenzi (1995). From the latter paper we cite the following
result.
Theorem 5.1.2 Assume the lag function θ in Wθ satisﬁes
(a) θ ∈C3(I), with θ(0) = 0, θ′(0) = 1, θ′′(0) < 0, θ(t) < t (t ∈(0, T ]),
θ′(t) > 0 for t ∈I,
and let
(b) g ∈C2(I), with g(0) = g′(0) = 0;
(c) K ∈C3( ¯Dθ), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 (t ∈I).
Then the ﬁrst-kind delay integral equation (Wθ y)(t) = g(t) has a unique solu-
tion y ∈C(I).
Remark A similar result was proved in Denisov and Korovin (1992), but under
the hypothesis that θ′(0) < 1. If, as in the above theorem, θ′(0) = 1, the domain
¯Dθ has a cusp at the point (t, s) = (0, 0), and new techniques are needed to deal
with this situation. We note that the case θ′(0) = 1 was already treated, albeit
in a somewhat sketchy way, by Lalesco (1911).
In his papers of 1913 and 1914 Andreoli studied the class of ‘pure’ delay
integral equations of the second kind described by
y(t) = g(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I,
with
(Vθφ)(t) :=
 θ(t)
0
K(t, s)φ(s)ds,
and he illustrated his observation (Andreoli (1914, p. 77)) that
‘. . . la θ(t) avr`a un’enorme inﬂuenza sulle formole di soluzione . . .’
by two examples, namely
y(t) = g(t) +
 qt
0
K(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I = [0, T ] (0 < q < 1)
(5.1.4)
(which is also analysed in Chambers (1990)), and
y(t) = g(t) +
 tr
0
K(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈[0, 1] (r > 0).

256
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
The use of Picard iteration, extending Volterra’s approach of 1896, reveals im-
mediately that the representation of the solution is now much more complex
(see Theorem 5.1.4 below). Andreoli’s statement is even more true in the nu-
merical analysis of such proportional delay VIEs, as we shall see in Sections
5.2.5 and 5.3.6!
If the kernel in (5.1.4) is constant, K(t, s) = b/q, and g ∈C1(I), then the
delay VIE is equivalent to the proportional delay differential equation
y′(t) = g′(t) + by(qt),
t ∈I,
y(0) = g(0).
We shall have a closer look at ‘innocent’ DDEs of this type in the following
section (cf. (5.1.6)).
5.1.2 Linear differential equations with proportional delays
The linear DDE with constant coefﬁcients,
y′(t) = ay(t) + by(qt),
t ≥0 (0 < q < 1),
(5.1.5)
arose in the mathematical modelling of the wave motion in the supply line
to an overhead current collector (pantograph) of an electric locomotive (see
Ockendon and Tayler (1971) and Fox et al. (1971); also Tayler (1986, pp. 40–
45, 50–53)): the resulting pantograph equation is a (seemingly!) very simple
example of a DDE with vanishing delay on any interval I := [0, T ]: here, we
have θ(t) = t −τ(t), with τ(t) = (1 −q)t ≥0.
A special case of (5.1.5) is the ‘pure delay’ equation
y′(t) = by(qt),
t ≥0,
y(0) = y0
(b ̸= 0)
(5.1.6)
(which we have already met at the end of the previous section). Its (unique)
solution is given by
y(t) =
∞

j=0
q j( j−1)/2
j!
(bt) j · y0,
t ≥0.
(5.1.7)
Iserles (1993) presents an illuminating introduction into the beautifully com-
plex world of solutions to (5.1.5) and its generalisations.
The following result can be found in Kato and McLeod (1971); compare
also Frederickson (1971), Morris, Feldstein and Bowen (1972), Derfel (1990),
Iserles (1993), and Terj´eki (1995).
Theorem 5.1.3 For any q ∈(0, 1) and any y0 the delay differential equation
(5.1.5) possesses a unique solution y ∈C1(I) with y(0) = y0, regardless of the

choice of a, b ̸= 0, and T > 0. It is given by
y(t) =
∞

n=0
γn(q)tn,
where
γn(q) := 1
n!
n
j=1
(a + bq j−1).
Proof We apply Picard iteration to the equivalent Volterra integral equation,
y(t) = y0 +
 t
0
(ay(s) + by(qs))ds,
t ∈I.
It can be shown that the resulting sequence {yn(t)} (n ≥0, y0(t) := y0) con-
verges uniformly on any interval I. Moreover, setting
y(t) :=
∞

n=0
γn(q)tn,
one veriﬁes the power series has inﬁnite radius of convergence, since its coef-
ﬁcients satisfy
γn
γn−1

n [a + bqn−1],
n ≥1.
Remarks
1. The above result (except for the last statement) remains true for (5.1.5) with
variable coefﬁcients a, b ∈C(I). More precisely, if a, b ∈Cm(I) then, for
any q ∈(0, 1) and any y0, the solution y lies in Cm+1(I). See also Terj´eki
(1995) on various representations of solutions to linear pantograph DDEs.
Properties of solutions of nonlinear versions of these equations (e.g. Riccati-
type equations) can be found in the papers by Iserles (1994b) and Iserles and
Terj´eki (1995).
2. These results reveal a crucial difference between the regularity of solutions
of DDEs with non-vanishing delays and DDEs of pantograph-type DDEs:
for the latter, smooth data lead to solutions that are smooth on the entire
interval [0, T ]. In particular, solutions to (5.1.6) are entire functions of order
zero. It follows from classical complex function theory (Ahlfors’s Theorem)
that an entire function of order zero cannot have ﬁnite asymptotes. This
implies that, for b < 0, non-trivial solutions of (5.1.6) are not bounded on
IR+; also, the number of sign changes (zeros) is inﬁnite. (See also Iserles
(1993, 1997b), Liu (1997), and Exercise 5.6.2.) The properties of solutions
to the second-order analogue of (5.1.6) were analysed in B´elair (1981).

The values of |y(t)| in the interval given by the last listed zero and the
following one exceed 1015.
The reader interested in details on the asymptotic distribution of the zeros
of such solutions may wish to consult the 1992 paper by Elbert (which in-
cludes a reference to the ﬁrst study of this subject, a 1967 report by Feldstein
and Kolb).
5.1.3 Linear Volterra integral equations with
proportional delays
We now return to the delay VIE (5.1.4) considered by Andreoli (1913, 1914)
(and by Chambers (1990)), and to his remark about the effect the (vanishing)
proportional delay has on the representation of the solution.
Theorem 5.1.4 Let g and K in (5.1.4) satisfy g ∈C(I) and K ∈C(Dθ), where
Dθ := {(t, s) : 0 ≤s ≤θ(t), t ∈I}. Then for any θ(t) := qt with q ∈(0, 1)
the delay integral equation (5.1.4) possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I). This
solution is given by

Proof The Picard iteration process we applied to the integrated form (5.1.8)
of the pantograph DDE can of course be used for the delay VIE (5.1.4), with
suitably adapted Dirichlet’s formula when changing the order of integration
in the double integrals: here again, the resulting limits of integration depend
on the iteration number n. To see this in some more detail, we have, setting
y0(t) := g(t),
y1(t) := g(t) +

K1(t, s)g(s)ds,

It is now easily veriﬁed by induction that the iterated kernels Kn(t, s) of the

Kn+1(t, s) =
 qt

K(t, v)Kn(v, s)dv,
(t, s) ∈D(n+1)

(see also Chambers (1990)).
We leave the detailed steps of the proof as an exercise but state the uniform
bounds for the iterated kernels. This (readily veriﬁed) result will play a role
in the analysis of global superconvergence of collocation solutions for (5.1.9)
below (compare the proof of Theorem 5.3.4).
Lemma 5.1.5 Uniform bounds on I = [0, T ] for the iterated kernels Kn(t, s)

The existence, uniqueness and regularity properties hold also for the more
general linear delay VIE with proportional delay,

t ∈I,

Theorem 5.1.6 Assume that K1 ∈Cd(D) and K2 ∈Cd(Dθ), for some d ≥
0. Then the delay integral equation (5.1.9) with θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1) has a
unique solution y ∈Cd(I) for any g with g ∈Cd(I).
Proof Theorem 5.1.4 shows that the iterated kernels Kn(t, s; q) associated with
the kernel K of the special delay integral equation (5.1.4) inherit the regularity
of K. Since the additional term (Vy)(t) in the general linear delay VIE (5.1.9)
will not lead to lower regularity in the Picard iteration process, the assertion of
Theorem 5.1.5 follows from the uniform convergence of the Picard iterates on
I, for any q ∈(0, 1).
We shall see in Section 5.1.5 that this regularity result can also be derived
by means of embedding techniques.
Remark The paper by Morris, Feldstein and Bowen (1972, pp. 518–523) con-
tains an illuminating discussion of the connection between general pantograph
DDEs and certain Volterra integral and integro-differential equations with (mul-
tiple) proportional delays. Compare also Iserles and Liu (1994).
5.1.4 Volterra integro-differential equations with
proportional delays
In order to obtain some ﬁrst insight into the properties of solutions of linear
VIDEs with proportional delays we will consider the analogue of Andreoli’s
‘pure delay’ problem (5.1.4), namely
y′(t) = g(t) +
 qt
0
K(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I := [0, T ],
y(0) = y0,
(5.1.10)
assuming that g ∈C(I), K ∈C(Dθ), and 0 < q < 1. This initial-value prob-
lem is equivalent to the delay VIE
y(t) = g0(t) +

We now apply Theorem 5.1.4: setting H1(t, s) := H(t, s; q), and denoting by
Hn(t, s) the corresponding iterated kernels, the unique solution y of (5.1.11)
(which, since g0 and H(·, ·; q) are continuously differentiable functions, lies in
C1(I)) can be expressed in the form*

5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
The regularity of the kernels G1 and G2(·; ·; q) is determined by that of the
original data a, b and K1, K2. Thus, Theorem 5.1.6 implies
Theorem 5.1.8 Assume:
(a) a, b, g ∈Cd(I) for some d ≥0;
(b) K1 ∈Cd(D) and K2 ∈Cd(Dθ).
Then for each initial value y0 the delay VIDE (5.1.12) possesses a unique
solution y ∈Cd+1(I).
5.1.5 Embedding techniques
The embedding of a (proportional) delay differential equation into an inﬁnite
system of ordinary differential equations was studied in detail in the 1995 paper
by Feldstein, Iserles and Levin (1995). The motivation behind this approach
was to explore another way of obtaining results on the asymptotic stability
(or the boundedness) of solutions of such DDEs, and for constructing feasible
methods for their numerical solution. It also permits the derivation of regularity
results for the exact solutions.
Here, we extend these embedding techniques to the delay Volterra integral
equation (5.1.9) and to the delay Volterra integro-differential equation (5.1.12).
Note that these delay VEs contain the important special cases characterised by
K2(t, s) = −K1(t, s) =: −K(t, s):
y(t) = g(t) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈I,
(5.1.13)
and
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(qt) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈I;
y(0) = y0.
(5.1.14)
corresponding to the delay Volterra operator Wθ introduced in (5.1.2). The fol-
lowing embedding results (which can be extended to the nonlinear counterparts
of the above pantograph-type Volterra equations) contain the key not only to
establishing results on the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions
but possibly also to the analysis of the local superconvergence properties of
collocation solutions to such functional equations.
Embedding results for the DVIE (5.1.9)

where
zν(t) := y(qνt),
gν(t) := g(qνt)
and
K1,ν(t, s) := qν K1(qνt, qνs),
K2,ν(t, s) := qν+1K2(qνt, qν+1s).
The proof of this embedding result is left as an exercise.
Consider now the truncated (ﬁnite) system corresponding to (5.1.15),
zM,ν(t) = gν(t) +

Lemma 5.1.10 Assume that g ∈C(I), K1 ∈C(D), K2 ∈C(Dθ). Then for
ν = M, M −1, . . . , 0, the (unique) solution of (5.1.16), (5.1.17) satisﬁes
||zν −zM,ν||∞≤Cq
˜M,
with
˜M ≥M + 1.
Proof Setting εM,ν := zν −zM,ν, it follows from (5.1.16) and (5.1.17) that
εM,ν(t) =
 t

K1,ν(t, s)εM,ν(s)ds + M,ν(t),

 t

Let R1,ν = R1,ν(t, s) denote the resolvent kernel associated with the kernel
K1,ν in (5.1.15); we know from Section 2.1.1 that K1 ∈C(D) implies R1,ν ∈
C(D) for all ν ≥0. The (unique) solution of the ﬁnite system (5.1.18) may thus
be written as
εM,ν(t) =
 t
0
R1,ν(t, s)M,ν(s)ds + M,ν(t),
t ∈I
(5.1.19)
(ν = M, M −1, . . . , 0). Since |K2,ν(t, s)| ≤¯K 2 qν+1, (t, s) ∈Dθ, where
¯K 2 := maxDθ |K2(t, s)|, setting ν = M in (5.1.19) leads to
|εM,M(t)| ≤Cq M+1,
t ∈I.

264

Thus, assuming that ||ε||∞≤Cq ˜M ( ˜M ≥M) for ν = M, M −1, . . . , M0 + 1,
we ﬁnd
|M0,ν(t)| ≤¯K 2Tqν+1C0q
˜M =: Cq
˜M+ν+1,
ν ≥˜M + 1,
and hence,
|εM,M0(t)| ≤Cq

with
˜M ≥M + 1.
This establishes the uniform estimates in Lemma 5.1.10.
Embedding results for the DVIDE (5.1.12)
Lemma 5.1.11 The delay VIDE (5.1.12) can be embedded into an inﬁnite-
dimensional system of ‘classical’ VIDEs, namely,

˜bν(t) := qνb(qνt),
and
˜K i,ν(t, s) := qν Ki,ν(t, s) (i = 1, 2).
The kernels Ki,ν are those deﬁned in Lemma 5.1.9.
This easily veriﬁed result leads to the VIDE analogue of Lemma 5.1.10:
Lemma 5.1.12 Assume that a, b ∈C(I), K1 ∈C(D), and K2 ∈C(Dθ). Then

5.1.6 Nonlinear pantograph-type functional equations
Results on the existence, uniqueness and qualitative behaviour of solutions
to various classes of nonlinear DDEs with vanishing proportional delays can
be found for example in Iserles (1994a), Iserles and Tej´eki (1995), Feldstein,
Iserles and Levin (1995) (embedding techniques), and Feldstein and Liu (1998)
(see also for additional references).
Three typical examples are described below; the ﬁrst two were studied in
detail by Iserles (1994a) and Feldstein and Liu (1998).
Example 5.1.1 The nonlinear DDE with proportional delay,
y′(t) = ay(t) + by(qt)(1 −y(qt)),
t ≥0 (0 < q < 1).
(5.1.25)
is a Riccati-type equation which may be viewed as the proportional delay ana-
logue of the classical logistic equation.
Example 5.1.2 The rational version of (5.2.5) is
y′(t) =
ay(t)
1 + by(qt),
t ≥0 (0 < q < 1).
(5.1.26)
Example 5.1.3 Nonlinear second-kind Volterra integral equations with propor-
tional delays were studied by Chambers (1990). He showed that the equation
y(t) = g(t) +
 qt
0
k(t, s, y(s))ds,
t ∈I := [0, T ],
possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I) if g ∈C(I) and k satisﬁes
|k(t, s, y) −k(t, s, z)| ≤P(t)Q(s)|y −z| for (t, s) ∈Dθ, y, z ∈IR,
for some functions P and Q with P(t) = ptα, Q(s) = sβ (α, β ≥0).
Results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of more general non-
linear VIEs (and VIDEs) with vanishing proportional delays can be established
by using the embedding techniques described in the previous section. We leave
the details to the reader.
5.2 Collocation for DDEs with proportional delays
Since a complete understanding of the effects of the (seemingly simple) vanish-
ing proportional delay θ(t) = qt on the structure of the collocation equations
and hence on the convergence properties of collocation solutions to functional
equations with vanishing proportional delays is essential for tackling analo-
gous questions for problems with state-dependent delays, we will present a

5.1 Basic theory of functional equations with proportional delays

Let r1,ν = r1,ν(t, s) denote the (differential) resolvent kernel corresponding
to the functions ˜aν and ˜K 1,ν in (5.1.20); that is, r1,ν is deﬁned by the (unique)

r1,ν(t, z) ˜K 1,ν(z, s) dz,

with r1,ν(t, t) = 1, t ∈I (recall Theorem 3.1.2). The solution of the initial-
value problem (5.1.21),(5.1.22) can then be written in the form

(ν = M, M −1, . . . , 0), where εM,ν(0) = 0 for all ν. Since
|M,M(t)| ≤γ0q M + γ1q2M+1,
t ∈I,
for some ﬁnite constants γ1 (recall that
˜K 2,ν(t, s) = qν K2,ν(t, s) and
|K2,ν(t, s)| ≤¯K 2qν+1), we readily derive the uniform estimate
|εM,M(t)| ≤C0q M + C1q2M+1 =: Cq M,
t ∈I
(M ∈IN0),
where C = C(q, M) < ∞and q ∈(0, 1).
For ν < M the argument for bringing the proof to its conclusion is analogous
to the one in the proof of Lemma 5.1.10: we employ the representation (5.1.24)
and the estimate for ||εM,M||∞. Details are left to the reader.
Remark The(uniform)convergenceresultsinLemmas5.1.10and5.1.12allow
us not only to deduce the existence of unique solutions to the delay problems
(5.1.9) and (5.1.12) but also to establish the global regularity results already
alluded to: Cm-data imply that the solutions of the DVIE and the DVIDE lie,
respectively, in Cm(I) and Cm+1(I).

5.2 Collocation for DDEs with proportional delays
267
rather detailed description of the collocation equations and the corresponding
error analysis, perhaps more so than in the previous chapters. Although Runge–
Kutta methods for pantograph-type DDEs are studied in some detail in Bellen
and Zennaro (2003), our approach in Section 5.2.1 may yield some additional
insight into collocation-based continuous RK methods.
5.2.1 Collocation and continuous Runge–Kutta methods
Assume that the initial-value problem
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(qt)),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
y(0) = y0 (0 < q < 1),
(5.2.1)
possesses a unique solution y ∈C1(I). As we have seen in Section 5.1.2, so-
lutions of equations with proportional delays on any interval [0, T ] essentially
inherit the regularity of the given data on that interval; that is, there are no pri-
mary discontinuity points, in sharp contrast to DDEs with non-vanishing delays
(e.g. (5.2.1) on I = [t0, T ] with t0 > 0). Hence, the meshes Ih underlying the
collocation space S(0)
m (Ih) need not be constrained ones, and we may choose, as
in Section 1.1 for ODEs,
Ih := {tn : 0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tN = T },
with
σn := (tn, tn+1], hn := tn+1 −tn, h := max
(n) hn,
and ¯σn := [tn, tn+1]. The resulting computational form of the collocation equa-
tion for uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih),
u′
h(t) = f (t, uh(t), uh(qt)),
t ∈Xh,
uh(0) = y0,
(5.2.2)
with collocation points
Xh := {tn,i := tn + cihn : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)},
is, however, much more complex than the one for ODEs or for DDEs with
non-vanishing delays. This is due to the presence of the terms q(tn + cihn):
since t0 = 0, these points qtn,i will initially lie in the same subinterval σn as
the collocation points tn,i themselves, and this will be followed in general by
‘partial overlap’. The collocation equations assume a structure similar to the one
of the collocation equation corresponding to a DDE with non-vanishing delay
only after some ‘transition phase’, when we have reached the subintervals σn
for which qtn,i ≤tn for all i = 1, . . . , m.

268
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
We shall limit our analysis to uniform meshes and to certain (quasi-) ge-
ometric meshes. The (non-trivial!) case of more general meshes – important
when designing collocation methods on adaptive meshes Ih – will be left as a
research problem (Exercise 5.6.24).
Assume ﬁrst that Ih := {tn := nh : n = 0, 1, . . . , N; ; hn = h = T/N} is a
uniform mesh. Set
qn,i := ⌊q(n + ci)⌋,
γn,i := q(n + ci) −qn,i ∈[0, 1),
(5.2.3)
where, for x ∈IR, ⌊x⌋denotes the largest integer not exceeding x. Hence,
qtn,i = q(tn + cih) = h · (qn,i + γn,i) = tqn,i + γn,ih ∈[tqn,i, tqn,i+1].
(5.2.4)
We denote by ⌈x⌉the least upper integer bound of x ∈IR.
Lemma 5.2.1 Let q ∈(0, 1) and 0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 be given, and assume
that Ih is a uniform mesh with mesh diameter h = T/N. Then:
(i) For n = 0 we have qtn,i ∈(tn, tn+1) for i = 1, . . . , m.
(ii) If n ≥1, then qtn,i ∈(tn, tn+1) for i = 1, . . . , m if, and only if, n <
⌈
q
1−q c1⌉=: q I.
(iii) qtn,i ≤tn for i = 1, . . . , m if, and only if, ⌈
q
1−q cm⌉=: q I I ≤n ≤N −1.
Proof
(i) Assuming that c1 > 0 we clearly have q(t0 + cih) = h · qci ∈(0, h) for
all i; i.e., ‘complete overlap’ occurs always at least for n = 0, for any
q ∈(0, 1).
(ii) Since qtn,i ≥qtn,1, qtn,1 ∈(tn, tn+1) if, and only if, q(n + c1) > n. This
holds if, and only if, n < qc1/(1 −q).
(iii) We have qtn,i ≤tn for i = 1, . . . , m if, and only if, qtn,m ≤tn. This leads
to the condition that n ≥qcm/(1 −q), and hence to the ﬁnal assertion in
Lemma 5.2.1.
The above results and their proofs are readily modiﬁed to cover sets {ci}
where c1 = 0 (e.g. the Lobatto points). We leave this as an exercise.
Lemma 5.2.1 shows that the recursive computation of the collocation solu-
tion for the DDE (5.2.1) with vanishing proportional delay qt (or, as we shall
see in subsequent sections, for analogous DV2s and DVIDEs with vanishing
proportional delays) consists in general of three phases:
r Phase I: This ‘initial phase’ (complete overlap) is described by the values n
satisfying
0 ≤n <

q
1 −q c1

=: q I

5.2 Collocation for DDEs with proportional delays
269
(assuming again that c1 > 0). For these values of n we have q(tn + cih) > tn
for i = 1, . . . , m. As already metioned in Lemma 5.2.1 this is always true
when n = 0, for any q ∈(0, 1).
r Phase II: The ‘transition phase’ (partial overlap) is characterised by the
values of n with
q I ≤n <

q
1 −q cm

=: q I I.
In this phase there exists, for given n, a νn ∈{1, . . . , m −1} so that
q(tn + cih) ≤tn
for i = 1, . . . , νn,
while
q(tn + cih) > tn
for i = νn + 1, . . . , m.
Note that this phase may be empty (recall Example 5.2.1, and see Exercise
5.6.11).
r Phase III: The ‘pure delay phase’ (no overlap) consists of those values of n
for which
q I I ≤n ≤N −1.
Here,
q(tn + cih) ≤tn
for all
i = 1, . . . , m,
that is, qn,i ≤n −1 for all i = 1, . . . , m.
Example 5.2.1
For q = 1/2 and n = 1,
q(tn + cih) = hq(1 + ci) ≤h(1 + ci)/2 ≤h, i = 1, . . . , m.
Thus, we have either (assuming c1 > 0)
qtn,i > n (i = 1, . . . , m) =⇒n = 0,
or
qtn,i ≤tn (i = 1, . . . , m) if 1 ≤n ≤N −1.
Hence, q I = q I I = 1: Phase II is empty for all values of m and any set {ci}
with c1 > 0.
Compare also Example 5.4.1 (m = 1) and the values for qn,1 and γn,1 given in
Tables 5.4–5.7.

270
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
Example 5.2.2
Let q = 1/2 and uh ∈S(0)
2 (Ih) (m = 2). Hence,
qn,i = ⌊(n + ci)/2⌋= ⌊ci/2 + n/2⌋(i = 1, 2).
r Let the {ci} be the Gauss points: c1 = (3 −
√
3)/6, c2 = (3 +
√
3)/6. It is
easily seen that
qn,i = ⌊n/2⌋(i = 1, 2),
and
γn,1 =

(3 −
√
3)/12 if n is even
(9 −
√
3)/12 if n is odd
γn,2 =

(3 +
√
3)/12 if n is even
(9 +
√
3)/12 if n is odd.
Here, we have q I = ⌈c1⌉= 1, q I I = ⌈c2⌉= 1, a particular case of the pre-
vious example.
r For the Radau II points, c1 = 1/3, c2 = 1, we ﬁnd
qn,1 = ⌊1/6 + n/2⌋= ⌊n/2⌋,
qn,2 = ⌊(n + 1)/2⌋,
and
γn,1 =

1/6 if n is even
2/3 if n is odd
γn,2 =

1/2 if n is even
0
if n is odd.
The values of q I and q I I are again given by q I = q I I = 1.
Example 5.2.3
Assume that q = 0.9 and uh ∈S(0)
2 (Ih) (m = 2).
r For the Gauss points, Lemma 5.2.1 yields
qtn,i > tn (i = 1, 2) if, and only if n < ⌈9c1⌉= 2,
and
qtn,i ≤tn (i = 1, 2) if, and only if n ≥⌈9c2⌉= 8.
Thus, for n = 2, . . . , 7 we have
qtn,1 ∈(tn−1, tn] and qtn,2 ∈(tn, tn+1).

It follows that q I = ⌈9c1⌉= 2, q I I = ⌈9c2⌉= 8.

qtn,i > tn (i = 1, 2) if, and only if n < ⌈9c1⌉= 3,
and
qtn,i ≤tn (i = 1, 2) if, and only if n ≥⌈9c2⌉= 9,
implying that for n = 3, . . . , 8 we have
qtn,1 ∈(tn−1, tn] and qtn,2 ∈(tn, tn+1).
Hence, q I = ⌈9c1⌉= 3, q I I = ⌈9c2⌉= 9.
For later reference we add a brief summary of values of q I and q I I corre-
sponding to m = 2, m = 3 and to two prominent sets of collocation parameters.

We complement these illustrations by a more general result: it deals with a
classofvaluesofq forwhichwehaveq I = q I I andforwhichinPhaseIII(q I I ≤
n ≤N −1) all values q(tn + cih (i = 1, . . . , m) lie in the same subinterval.
Lemma 5.2.2 Let 0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1, and assume that q is of the form
q = 1/r, with r ∈IN, r ≥2. Then:
(a) q I = q I I = 1: Phase I consists of n = 0 only, Phase II is empty, and hence
Phase III is described by 1 ≤n ≤N −1.

(b) In Phase III, the images θ(tn,i) := q(tn + cih) (i = 1, . . . , m) all lie in the
same subinterval (tqn, tqn+1] for some qn < n −1.
(c) For kr ≤n < (k + 1)r we have qn = k.

(because, by (5.2.4), qtn,i ∈[tqn,i, tqn,i+1]), with ai, j := β j(ci). Thus, by Lemma
5.2.1, as n increases from 0 to N −1 the above systems of nonlinear algebraic
equations for Yn := (Yn,1, . . . , Yn,m)T ∈IRm assume the following forms:
(I) Initial phase (complete overlap)
0 ≤n < q I.
For these values of n we have, according to Lemma 5.2.1, qtn,i >
tn (i = 1, . . . , m); this is always true at least for n = 0. Since now

t ∈I,
(5.2.8)

5.2 Collocation for DDEs with proportional delays

and

and deﬁning

(II) Transition phase (partial overlap)
q I ≤n < q I I.
If this set of values n is not empty (recall the remark following Lemma 5.2.1),
let νn ∈INwith 1 ≤νn < m be such that
qn,i = n −1 (i = 1, . . . , νn) and
qn,i = n,
γn,i > 0 (i = νn + 1, . . . , m).

of q, the indices qn,i and qn, j (i ̸= j) are either equal or differ by one. Thus,
for such an n there is an integer νn ∈{1, . . . , m} so that
qn,i = qn (i = 1, . . . , νn) and qn,i = qn + 1, γn,i > 0 (i = νn + 1, . . . , m),

5.2 Collocation for DDEs with proportional delays
275
Remark We will employ the above notation also in subsequent sections: if a
matrix or vector carries the argument q, it is to indicate a contribution from a
delay term; a hat over a matrix or vector suggests that this quantity originates
from an index i ∈{1, . . . , νn} with νn < m.
Summary The collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for uniform mesh Ih and col-
location parameters {0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1} has, on the subinterval σn :=
[tn, tn+1], the local representation (5.2.5) in which Yn = (Yn,1, . . . , Yn,m)T is
determined by a system of algebraic equations in IRm, as follows:
Phase I (complete overlap):
0 ≤n < ⌈qc1/(1 −q)⌉=: q I:
(5.2.7) (nonlinear DDE (5.2.1)), or (5.2.9) (linear DDE (5.2.8));
Phase II (partial overlap):
q I ≤n < ⌈qcm/(1 −q)⌉=: q I I:
(5.2.10),(5.2.11) (nonlinear DDE (5.2.1)), or (5.2.12) (linear DE (5.2.8));
Phase III (no overlap):
q I I ≤n ≤N −1:
(5.2.13), (5.2.14) (nonlinear DDE (5.2.1)), or (5.2.15) (linear DDE (5.2.8)).
Although we have based the above discussion on the assumption that c1 > 0,
these arguments are – as we have already brieﬂy indicated – readily modiﬁed to
include the case where c1 = 0 (occurring, for example, when we choose c1 = 0
and cm = 1, thus generating a continuous collocation solution uh). We leave
this as an exercise (Exercise 5.6.15).
The existence and uniqueness of the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih), i.e.
the unique solvability for sufﬁciently small h > 0 of the nonlinear or linear
algebraic systems mentioned in the above summary, follows from arguments
essentially identical with those in Section 1.1 (Theorem 1.1.2) and Section 2.1
(Theorem 2.2.1). Note in particular that the matrix of the linear system (5.2.15)
(pure delay phase) coincides of course with the ones for the linear ODEs in
(1.1.16).
Theorem 5.2.3 Assume that the given functions a and b in (5.2.8) are con-
tinuous on I. Then there exists an ¯h > 0 so that the linear algebraic systems
(5.2.9), (5.2.12) and (5.2.15) are uniquely solvable whenever the mesh diameter
of the underlying uniform mesh Ih satisﬁes h ∈(0, ¯h). Thus, for such meshes the
collocation equation (5.2.2), with f (t, y, z) := a(t)y + b(t)z, deﬁnes a unique
collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) whose local representation on ¯σn is given by
(5.2.5).
We shall see in Section 5.2.3 that the analysis of the attainable order of local
superconvergence (on Ih) is very complex (and is not yet fully understood)

276
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
if the mesh Ih is uniform. This is due to the fact that such meshes are not
θ-invariant and, as we have seen above, lead to initial ‘overlap’. Moreover,
collocation on uniform meshes will lead to severe storage problems if it is used
for long-time integration (compare the papers by Iserles (1997b) and by Liu
(1997) for illuminating comments and illustrations in the case of DDEs with
proportional delays). Hence, it seems natural to ask if (non-uniform) meshes
can be constructed for which the ‘non-vanishing delay techniques’ of Chapter
4 can be employed.
Two such approaches have recently been analysed: Brunner, Hu and Lin
(2001) consider collocation solutions uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) where Ih is a geometric
mesh deﬁned by
tn = t(N)
n
:= q1/κT
(n = 1, . . . , N),
(5.2.16)
where κ = κ(q; N) depends not only on q ∈(0, 1) but also on the number N
of subintervals σn corresponding to the mesh Ih.
Collocation (or, more generally, continuous implicit Runge–Kutta methods)
on quasi-geometric meshes requires the computation of a sufﬁciently accurate
approximation y0 to y on some (small) initial interval [0, t0], with t0 = q MT
(Bellen (2002)). Once a feasible (small) t0 > 0 has been chosen, we deﬁne the
points {ξµ} by setting
ξµ := q M−µT
(µ = 0, 1, . . . , M)
(these points may be viewed as the primary discontinuiy points generated by
ξ0 := t0 > 0), each of the subintervals [ξµ, ξµ+1] is endowed with a (usually
uniform) mesh deﬁned by
I (µ)
h
:= {t(µ)
n
:= ξµ + (n/N)[ξµ+1 −ξµ] : n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1}.
We shall describe the details in Sections 5.5.3 and 5.5.4 when studying collo-
cation solutions for DVIDEs with proportional delays. Consult also Example
4.3.1.
5.2.2 Global convergence results: uniform Ih
We ﬁrst study the convergence of the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) on uni-
form meshes Ih. In order to exhibit the basic principles underlying the global
convergence and error analysis more clearly and without additional technicali-
ties we will deal ﬁrst with the linear proportional delay equation (5.2.8).
Theorem 5.2.4 Consider the linear DDE (5.2.8),
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(qt) + g(t),
t ∈I = [0, T ] (0 < q < 1),

5.2 Collocation for DDEs with proportional delays
277
with initial condition y(0) = y0, and assume that
(a) a, b, g ∈Cm(I);
(b) uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the (unique) collocation solution to (5.2.8) corresponding
to uniform Ih and collocation parameters {ci} with 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1.
Then for all uniform meshes Ih with diameter h ∈(0, ¯h) (cf. Theorem 5.2.3) we
have
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞:= sup
t∈I
|y(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cν||y(m+1)||∞hm
(ν = 0, 1),
(5.2.17)
and this optimal order estimate holds for any set {ci} deﬁning the set of collo-
cation points Xh. The constants Cν depend on the {ci} but not on h.
Proof Theorem 5.1.3 shows that assumption (a) implies y ∈Cm+1(I). Thus,
the local representations (1.1.22), (1.1.24) of the collocation error eh := y −uh
carry over to the present situation, except that now collocation is based on
uniform meshes Ih. To be more precise, we have

By Theorem 5.2.3, each of the linear algebraic systems (5.2.22), (5.2.23),
(5.5.24) possesses a unique solution En whenever h ∈(0, ¯h). Thus, the argu-
ments we used to pass from the linear system (1.1.31) to a generalised discrete
Gronwall inequality for ||En||1 are readily adapted to the present situation: de-
noting by DI

Thus, the standard argument of Section 1.1.1 and the local representations for
eh and e′
h yield, respectively, ||En||1 ≤BMm+1hm (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1), and
hence the asserted estimates (5.2.17) follow.
Remark If the regularity assumption y ∈Cm+1(I) replaced by y ∈Cd+1(I)
with 1 ≤d < m, then a trivial modiﬁcation (employing the Peano Kernel The-
orem with remainder terms Rd+1,n(v)) leads to
Theorem 5.2.5 Suppose that assumption (a) of Theorem 5.2.4 is replaced
by
a, b, g ∈Cd(I), 1 ≤d ≤m. Then the collocation error eh := y −uh

for all uniform Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h).
We now enter what may be called ‘new territory’ – as predicted by Andreoli
(1914) (cf. Section 5.1.1): we shall see that while the global superconvergence
results for DDEs and VIEs with non-vanishing delays (e.g. Theorems 4.5.3 and
4.3.3) remain valid for pantograph-type functional equations (but with much
less obvious proofs!), this is no longer true for local superconvergence state-
ments. The following result can be proved by adapting the analysis employed
in Brunner and Hu (2003).

graph equation
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(qt) + g(t),
t ∈I,
are in Cm+1(I). If the collocation parameters satisfy the orthogonality condition
J0 :=
 1

m

i=1
(s −ci)ds = 0,
then the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) on uniform Ih can be estimated by
||y −uh||∞≤Chm+1.
(5.2.27)
This holds for any q ∈(0, 1), and the exponent m + 1 is best possible.
We shall obtain this result as a special case of the more general convergence
theorem for delay VIDEs with vanishing proportional delays (Theorem 5.5.4).
5.2.3 Attainable order at t = t1 = h
To obtain some ﬁrst insight into the optimal local superconvergence properties
of the collocation solution at the points of a uniform mesh Ih, suppose that the
solution of the initial-value problem
y′(t) = by(qt),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
y(0) = 1, (0 < q < 1),
(5.2.28)
is approximated by uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih). What can be said about the order of y(t) −
uh(t) at t = t1 = h? Since uh ∈πm in ¯σ0 := [0, h], the collocation equation
u′
h(t) = buh(qt), t ∈Xh ∩¯σ0, may be written in the form
u′
h(t) −buh(qt) = K · Mm((t −tn)/h),
t ∈¯σ0,
vh(0) = 1.

(s −ci) (s = (t −tn)/h)
(which for brevity we will often denote just by M(s)) is the collocation poly-
nomial introduced in Lemma 1.1.11, and K is a constant to be determined.
(Compare also Nørsett (1974, 1984) and the monograph by Iserles and Nørsett
(1991, pp. 29–32).) Note that K M((t −tn)/h) is of course closely related to
the defect δh(t) induced by the collocation solution uh: it is deﬁned by
δh(t) := −u′
h(t) + buh(qt) = −K M((t −tn)/h),
t ∈¯σ0.
The following result may also be found in Brunner (1997a). Observe that
for q = 1 we obtain the result of Lemma 1.1.12.
Theorem 5.2.7 The value of the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for (5.2.28)
at t = t1 = h is given by
uh(h) = vh(h) = Pm,m(z; q)/Qm,m(z; q),
with
Pm,m(z; q) :=
m

j=0
q j(2m−j+1)/2M(m−j)(1/qm−j+1)z j,
Qm,m(z; q) :=
m

j=0
q j(2m−j+1)/2M(m−j)(0)z j.
Remark Observe that the term in Pm,m(z; q) corresponding to j = m contains
the factor M(1/q) which, for q ∈(0, 1), does not vanish. Hence, the numerator
polynomial in the expression for uh(h) is of exact degree m for any set {ci} with
ci ∈[0, 1].
Proof The proof is a straightforward adaptation of ideas due to Nørsett (see,
e.g. Nørsett (1975) or Iserles and Nørsett (1991, pp. 29–32)). It follows from
equation (5.2.29) that
u′′
h(t) −bqu′
h(t) = K M′((t −t0)/h),
t ∈¯σ0,
and hence,
u′′
h(t) −bq{buh(q2t) + K M(q(t −t0)/h)} −K M′((t −t0)/h) = 0,
t ∈¯σ0,
where we have set, without loss of generality, h = 1. This leads to

5.2 Collocation for DDEs with proportional delays
283
Here, z := bh, and we have u(m+1)
h
(t) ≡0 on ¯σ0. Setting t = 0 and t = 1/qm+1,
respectively, and observing that uh(0) = 0, we readily ﬁnd
uh(h) =

j=0
q(m−j)(m+ j+1)/2M( j)(1/q j+1)zm−j
m

j=0
q(m−j)(m+ j+1)/2M( j)(0)zm−j
.
An obvious change in the order of summation leads to the desired result.
Example 5.2.1 m = 1
Here, the collocation polynomial is M(s) = s −c1, and the expressions for
uh(h) and the [1/1]-Pad´e approximant are given respectively by
uh(h) = 1 + (1 −qc1)z
1 −qc1z
and
R1/1(z; q) = 1 + (1 −q/2)z
1 −(q/2)z
(z := bh).
Note that these expressions coincide for any q ∈(0, 1) if, and only if, c1 = 1/2
(collocation at the Gauss points).
Example 5.2.2 m = 2
The collocation polynomial has the form M(s) = (s −c1)(s −c2)/2, and we
readily obtain
uh(h) = 1 + [1 −(1/2)q2(c1 + c2]z + (q/2)[1 −q(c1 + c2) + q2c1c2]z2
1 −(1/2)q2(c1 + c2)z + (1/2)q3c1c2z2
(see also [195]), while the [2, 2]-Pad´e approximant is found to be
R2/2(z; q) =
1 + [(6 −4q −2q2 + q4)/(2(3 −2q))]z + [q(18 −24q + 10q3 −3q4)/(12(3 −2q))]z2
1 −[q2(2 −q2)/(2(3 −2q))]z + [q4(4 −3q)/(12(3 −2q))]z2
.
For the Gauss points, c1 = (3 −
√
3)/6, c2 = (3 +
√
3)/6, and q = 1/2 the
above expressions become, respectively,
vh(h) = 1 + (7/8)z + (13/96)z2
1 −(1/8)z + (1/96)z2
and
R2/2(z; 1/2) = 1 + (57/64)z + (113/768)z2
1 −(7/64)z + (5/768)z2
.
It follows that they are identical if, and only if, q = 1.
For the Radau II points c1 = 1/3, c2 = 1 we obtain
uh(h) = 1 + [1 −(2/3)q2]z + (q/2)[1 −(4/3)q + (1/3)q2]z2
1 −(2q2/3)z + (q3/6)z2
.

Note that this rational function is not the [1/2]-Pad´e approximant to y(h).
Do there exist (distinct) collocation parameters ˆci = ˆci(q) ∈[0, 1] so that
vh(h) = Rm/m(z; q) for all q ∈(0, 1)? This question was answered by Brunner
(1997a) for m = 2 and by Takama, Muroya and Ishiwata (2000) for arbitrary
m ≥3. See also Ishiwata (2000).
5.2.4 Local superconvergence on uniform meshes
The optimal order estimates for the collocation solution at the ﬁrst mesh point
t = t1 = h of the previous section might suggest that, for collocation at the
Gauss points, the optimal order of convergence of uh(t) at t ∈Ih is again
p∗= 2m, or at least p∗= 2m −1. Numerical examples suggest that we have
p∗= 2m when m = 2 (see Brunner (1997a); however, this is no longer true
for m > 2. Instead the following result (whose proof is still elusive) appears to
hold when m ≥3. It is a special case of Conjecture 5.5.5.
Conjecture 5.2.8 Assume that the assumptions on a, b, g of Theorem 5.2.6
hold, but with Cm+1(I) replaced by Cd(I) (d ≥m + 2). If the collocation solu-
tion uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) corresponds to the collocation parameters given by the Gauss
points {ci} and if m ≥2, then
max
t∈Ih |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Chm+2,
where m + 2 cannot be replaced by m + 3. This estimate is true for all q ∈
(0, 1).
Remark We shall see in Section 5.5.4 that the classical local superconvergence
results (e.g. p∗= 2m for collocation at the Gauss points) can be restored if we
use quasi-geometric meshes. For DDEs with proportional delays this was shown
by Bellen (2001).

(5.3.3)
We shall return to (5.3.3) in more detail in Section 5.4. We will ﬁrst focus on
general second-kind delay VIEs of which (5.3.1) with b(t) ≡0 is a particular
case. It will be seen later that the analysis of collocation methods for (5.3.1)
with b ̸≡0 is much harder.
5.3.1 The collocation equations for uniform meshes
Set θ(t) := qt, 0 < q < 1, and recall the delay integral equation (5.1.9),
y(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(5.3.4)
with Volterra operators V and Vθ given by
(Vy)(t) :=
 t
0
K1(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I,
and
(Vθ y)(t) :=
 θ(t)
0
K2(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I.
Their kernels are assumed to be continuous on their respective domains D :=
{(t, s) : 0 ≤s ≤t ≤T } and Dθ := {(t, s) : 0 ≤s ≤θ(t), t ∈I}.
As for DDEs with (vanishing) proportional delay, smooth data g, K1 and K2
in (5.3.4) yield correspondingly smooth solutions y (Theorem 5.1.5), and hence
we may choose the same collocation space as for classical (non-delay) second-
kind VIEs, namely S(−1)
m−1(Ih), with unconstrained mesh Ih and with collocation
points again given by
Xh := {tn,i := tn + cihn : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}.
The equations
uh(t) = g(t) + (Vuh)(t) + (Vθuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(5.3.5)
and
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Vuh)(t) + (Vθuh)(t),
t ∈I,
(5.3.6)
determine, respectively, the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) and the corre-
sponding iterated collocation solution uit
h ∈C(I) for (5.3.4). As in Section 5.2.1

286
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
we shall ﬁrst study the computational form of the collocation equation (5.3.5) on
uniform meshes; collocation on geometric meshes will be considered in Section
5.3.7.
For uniform meshes Ih the general framework is the one introduced in Section
5.2.1. Recall in particular that, for t = tn,i := tn + cih ∈Xh, we set
qtn,i = tqn,i + γn,ih ∈[tqn,i, tqn,i+1],
with
qn,i := ⌊q(n + ci)⌋,
γn,i := q(n + ci) −qn,i.
Hence, the collocation equation (5.3.5) at t = tn,i (i = 1, . . . , m) becomes
Un,i = g(tn,i) + Fn(tn,i) + h
 ci

K1(tn,i, s)uh(s)ds + (Vθuh)(tn,i).

Recall from Section 5.2.1 that the integer qn,i is not necessarily the same for all
i ∈{1, . . . , m}: it is possible that qn,i = qn, j −1 for some i < j.

If this set of values n is not empty, there exists, for given n, an integer νn ∈

This conﬁrms of course that once we have reached Phase III the matrix charac-
terising the linear algebraic system (5.3.14) coincides with the one in (2.2.14),
the linear algebraic system for second-kind Volterra integral equations without
delay argument.
The existence of a unique collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is guaranteed by
Theorem 5.3.1 Assume that g, K1, K2 are continuous on their domains
I, D, Dq, and let the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to the delay VIE

5.3 Second-kind VIEs with proportional delays
289
(5.3.4) be deﬁned by (5.3.5) and (5.3.10). Then there exists an ¯h > 0 (depend-
ing on q) so that for all h ∈(0, ¯h) each of the linear algebraic systems (5.3.12),
(5.3.13), (5.3.14) possesses a unique solution Un. Thus, for such a mesh Ih the
collocation solution uh is unique for all q ∈(0, 1), and it is given locally, on
σn, by (5.3.10).
The proof is completely analogous to the one for Theorem 2.2.1 and is readily
carried out by applying the Neumann Lemma to each of the linear algebraic
systems (5.3.12)–(5.3.14). We leave the details to the reader.
Once the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) has been computed, the cor-
responding iterated collocation solution uit

5.3.2 Two prominent DVIEs with proportional delay
We will now brieﬂy illustrate the foregoing analysis by looking at two particular
cases of the general delay Volterra integral equation (5.3.1) which we have met

290
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
before. These delay integral equations have both historical and practical signif-
icance. The ﬁrst is the ‘pure delay’ Volterra integral equation corresponding to
K1 = 0,
y(t) = g(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I = [0, T ],
(5.3.18)
where
(Vθ y)(t) :=
 θ(t)
0
K(t, s)y(s)ds,
(5.3.19)
with θ(t) := qt (0 < q < 1). Its collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is com-
puted by solving the linear algebraic systems (5.3.12)–(5.3.14) in which Bn = 0
and B(ℓ)
n
for all n and ℓ< n. See also Exercise 5.6.16.
The more interesting equation corresponds formally to K2 = −K1 in (5.3.4),
y(t) = g(t) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈I,
(5.3.20)
with Wθ : C(I) →C(I) given by
(Wθ y)(t) :=
 t

K(t, s)y(s)ds.
(5.3.21)
Let t = tn,i := tn + cih ∈Xh be given. If n is such that qtn,i ≤tn, we may write

If qtn,i > tn we have qn,i = n and γn,i > 0 (which is true for all i = 1, . . . , m
in Phase I, and at least for some i in Phase II, unless it is empty). Hence, the

5.3.3 Global convergence results: uniform Ih
Consider the linear delay integral equation introduced in Section 5.3.1,
y(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(5.3.27)
with V and Vθ as in (5.3.4), and θ(t) := qt (0 < q < 1).
Theorem 5.3.2 Assume:
(a) The given functions describing (5.3.27) satisfy the regularity conditions
g ∈Cm(I), K1 ∈Cm(D), and K2 ∈Cm(Dθ).
(b) For given uniform mesh Ih and collocation points Xh, uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is the
collocation solution to (5.3.27).
Then for any uniform mesh Ih with mesh diameter h ∈(0, ¯h), with ¯h as in
Theorem 5.3.1, and any set {ci} of m distinct collocation parameters in [0, 1],
the collocation error eh := y −uh can be estimated by
||eh||∞≤C||y(m)||∞hm.
(5.3.28)
The constant C depends on the {ci} but not on h.
Proof We have seen in Theorem 5.1.5 that assumption (a) implies that the
(unique) solution y of (5.3.27) lies in Cm(I). Thus, we may again resort to the
local representation (2.2.31) for the collocation error eh := y −uh on σn,

The description in the previous section of the structure of the recursive
process underlying the collocation method for the proportional delay VIE
(5.3.27) contains all the essential ingredients for proving Theorem 5.3.2: since
Phase I and Phase II, corresponding to the values of n for which, respectively,
0 ≤n < q I := ⌈c1q/(1 −q)⌉and q I ≤n < q I I := ⌈cmq/(1 −q)⌉holds, in-
volve only ﬁnitely many time steps, regardless of the choice of h, the order of
convergence is governed by a generalised discrete Gronwall inequality arising
from the pure delay Phase III. We observe that these systems of linear algebraic
equations for En closely resemble the ones for Un, namely (5.3.12)–(5.3.14):
the role of gn is now assumed by terms reﬂecting the (Peano) error terms in the
local representation (5.3.29) of the collocation error. Thus, depending on the
value of n and the corresponding qn,i the details are as follows:
(I):
0 ≤n < q I := ⌈qc1/(1 −q)⌉
Here, qn,i = n for all values of i = 1, . . . , m, with γn,i > 0. Thus, proceeding
along familiar lines and using the notation introduced in (5.3.13), the vector
En := (En,1, . . . , En,m)T is deﬁned by the solution of the linear algebraic system

According to Theorem 5.3.1 each of the above linear algebraic systems
(5.3.33)–(5.3.35) possesses a unique solution for (uniform) meshes Ih with
h ∈(0, ¯h). Thus, we may proceed as in the proof of Theorem 2.2.3: denoting
by D0 the constant for which we have

h ∈(0, ¯h) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1),
with

if 0 ≤n < q I
Bn + B I I
n (q)
if q I ≤n < q I I

if q I I ≤n ≤N −1,
we are led to a generalised discrete Gronwall inequality for ||En||1 of the type
(5.2.25), except that now the last term reads γ1Mmhm, because of the lower-
order bounds for the ρ-terms in (5.3.33)–(5.3.35). Hence, in complete analogy
totheﬁnalargumentintheproofofTheorem2.2.3weobtain||En||1 ≤BMmhm,
leading via the local error representation (5.3.29) to ||eh||∞≤C Mmhm.
The following corollary to Theorem 5.3.2 addresses again the case where
the solution y of (5.3.27) does not have full regularity; that is, if instead of
y ∈Cm(I) we only have y ∈Cd(I), 1 ≤d < m (which corresponds to the
assumption that the given functions lie only in Cd(I)).
Corollary 5.3.3 If assumption (a) in Theorem 5.3.2 is replaced by g ∈
Cd(I), K1 ∈Cd(D), K2 ∈Cd(Dθ), for some d with 1 ≤d < m, then the es-
timate
||eh||∞≤C||y(d)||∞hd
(5.3.36)
for the collocation error eh corresponding to uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is true for any set
Xh of collocation points deﬁned by distinct {ci} in [0, 1].
In Theorem 2.2.4 we showed that the iterated collocation solution for a clas-
sical Volterra integral equation of the second kind can be globally superconver-
gent if the collocation parameters are chosen judiciously. An analogous result

296
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
holds for second-kind VIEs with proportional delays. However, the proof of
this result (due to Brunner and Hu (2003) and based on interpolatory projection
techniques) is much more complex.
Theorem 5.3.4 If the collocation parameters {ci} are chosen so that
J0 :=

then
||y −uit
h ||∞≤Chm+1,
provided we have g ∈Cd+1(I) and K1 ∈Cd+1(D), K2 ∈Cd+1(Dθ), with
d ≥m. This global superconvergence result is true for any q ∈(0, 1), and
the exponent m + 1 can in general not be replaced by m + 2.
Proof Since the crucial term in the delay VIE (5.3.1) is Vθ y, we will prove
Theorem 5.3.4 for the ‘pure delay’ delay VIE (5.3.18), employing an approach
that is different from the one in Brunner and Hu (2003). This will exhibit
more clearly how the ‘overlapping effect’ seen in the solution representation of
Theorem 5.1.4 affects the superconvergence analysis.

For any ﬁnite T and q ∈(0, 1), the inﬁnite series is convergent (note its simi-
larity to the expression for the solution of the initial-value problem
y′(t) = ¯K θ y(qt),
t ∈[0, T ],
y(0) = y0,
at t = T , as seen in (5.1.7)!). We therefore conclude that there exist constants
C I(q) and C I I(q) so that
|eit
h (t)| ≤(C I(q) + C I I(q))hm+1,
t ∈I.
5.3.4 A more general VIE with proportional delay
As we have seen at the beginning of Section 5.1.1, the ﬁrst-kind delay integral
equation (5.1.1) can often be recast as an equation of the second kind,
y(t) = g(t) + b(t)y(qt) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ]
(5.3.39)
(cf. (5.1.3))), with b(t) ̸≡0. This more general delay equation is a particular
case of
y(t) = g(t) + b(t)y(qt) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I.
(5.3.40)
It is immediately clear that the analysis of existence and uniqueness of the
collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), deﬁned by
uh(t) = g(t) + b(t)uh(qt) + (Vuh)(t) + (Vθuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
and that of its attainable order of convergence on I and Ih is much more com-
plex, due to the presence of the term b(t)uh(qt) on the right-hand side of the
collocation equation. The additional matrix representing the contribution of
b(tn,i)uh(qtn,i), for example to Phase I,
DI
n := diag(b(tn,i), . . . , b(tn,m))

L j(γn,i)
(i, j = 1, . . . , m)

,
implies that the matrix Im −h[Bn + B I
n(q)] characterising the linear algebraic
system (5.3.12) is now replaced by Im −DI
n −h[Bn + B I
n(q)]. Thus, since
DI
n does not carry the factor h, the statement Theorem 5.3.1, guaranteeing the
existence of a (unique) solution Un for all sufﬁciently small h, will in general no
longer remain valid, unless we have ||DI
n|| < 1 for all n. An analogous remark
applies to Phase II, while Phase III is no longer affected by the additional delay
term b(t)uh(qt).
A very particular case was studied by Y. Liu (1995b): it essentially corre-
sponds to the choice m = 1, c1 = 1, and it already exhibits the different, much
more difﬁcult nature of the analysis.

300
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
space S(−1)
m−1(Ih) we have, in general, uh(0) ̸= y0 = 1; that is,
uh(0) = 1 + ˜K M(0) ̸= 1 (unless c1 = 0).
Applying m-fold differentiation to the collocation equation (5.2.40) on ¯σ0 (and
setting again h = 1 for simplicity) we ﬁnd
0 ≡bmqm(m−1)/2uh(qmt) + ˜K
m−1

j=0
q j(2m−j−1)/2M(m−j)(q jt)z j.
It thus follows from the above value of uh(0) and by setting, respectively, t = 0
and t = 1/qm in the differentiated collocation equation that the ﬁrst assertion
of Theorem 5.3.5 is true.
To prove the second statement we ﬁrst note that, by deﬁnition,
uit
h (t) = 1 +
 qt
0
(b/q)uh(s)ds,
t ∈¯σ0.
Hence,
(d/dt)uit
h (t) = buh(qt),
t ∈¯σ0.
Since on ¯σ0 the iterated collocation solution uit
h for (5.3.39) reduces to a poly-
nomial of degree m, we ﬁnd that
0 ≡(dm/dtm)uit
h (t) = bm+1qm(m+1)/2uit
h (qm+1t)
+ bq2 ˜K
m

j=0
q j(2m−j−1)/2M(mj)(q j+1t).
The proof is brought to its conclusion by setting t = 0 and t = 1/qm+1 and by
observing that uh(0) = 1, in complete analogy to the proof of Theorem 5.2.7.
Example 5.3.1
For m = 1 we obtain
uit
h (h) = 1 + (1 −c1)z
1 −c1z
(z := bh)
for all values of q ∈(0, 1]. Thus, for c1 = 1/2 (Gauss point) this coincides with
the [1, 1]-Pad´e approximant for exp(z), regardless of q.
Example 5.3.2
For m = 2 Theorem 5.3.5 yields
uit
h (h) = 1 + (1 −[q(c1 + c2)/2]z + [q(1 −c1)(1 −c2)/2]z2
1 −[q(c1 + c2)/2]z + [qc1c2/2]z2
.

delay) remain valid when 0 < q < 1?

result remains of course true for q = 1; see Sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 (Corollary
1.1.10 and Lemma 1.1.12).
Proof In analogy to the proof of the previous theorem the collocation equation
for uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) on the ﬁrst subinterval ¯σ0 = [0, h] may be written as
uh(t) = 1 +
 qt
0
(b/q)uh(s)ds + ˜K M(t),
t ∈σ0,
(5.3.42)
where M(t) denotes the collocation polynomial with respect to the points {ci}.
There is, however, one major difference: since we are now in the discontinuous

5.3 Second-kind VIEs with proportional delays
301
If c1 and c2 are the Gauss points then
uit
h (h) = 1 + (1 −q/2)z + (q/12)z2
1 −(q/2)z + (q/12)z2
.
This rational function is different from the one for vh(h) (recall Example 5.2.2),
and it also differs from the [2, 2]-Pad´e approximant for y(h), whenever q ∈
(0, 1).
If we compare the expressions for vh(h) and uit
h (h) given, respectively, in
Theorem 5.2.7 and Theorem 5.3.5, we see that the following result (answering
one of the questions raised above) is now obvious. To state it, assume that
vh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is based on the collocation parameters {ci} while uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih)
corresponds to the m collocation parameters {ˆci}.
Theorem 5.3.6 For q ∈(0, 1), we obtain
uit
h (h) = vh(h) if, and only if, ˆci = qci (i = 1, . . . , m).
The proof of this result can be found in Takama, Muroya and Ishiwata (2000);
for m = 2 it was given in Brunner (1997a).
Remark For q = 1 the result of Theorem 5.3.6 reduces to the one in Corollary
1.1.10 (Section 1.1.5).
5.3.6 Local superconvergence analysis on uniform meshes
We have already seen that for DDEs with proportional delay the classical local
superconvergence order of p∗= 2m for collocation at the Gauss points can
no longer be attained if m > 2 (Conjecture 5.2.8). For pantograph-type delay
Volterra integral equations of the second kind the situation is even worse, as
the following theorem shows (Brunner and Hu (2003)). This is not really too
surprising in view of Theorem 5.3.6 on the relationship between the collocation
solutions for a special case of the pantograph equation and its integrated form.
To be more precise, we will now show that, in contrast to the global super-
convergence result of Theorem 5.3.2, the attainable order of local superconver-
gence on the uniform mesh Ih differs rather substantially from earlier classical
O(hm+κ)-estimates (κ ≤m) when m ≥3.
Theorem 5.3.7 Let uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) be the collocation solution to the DVIE
(5.3.27), and let uit
h be the corresponding iterated collocation solution. If the
collocation parameters {ci} are the Gauss points, then the order p∗in the
estimate
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uit
h (t)| ≤Ch p∗

302
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
cannot exceed m + 2. More precisely, the following is true:
(i) If q = 1/2, then
p∗=
m + 2
if m is even,
m + 1
if m is odd.
(ii) For q ∈(0, 1) \ {1/2} we attain only p∗= m + 1.
Proof See Brunner and Hu (2003).
We note in passing that the superconvergence results presented in Theorems
5.3.4 and 5.3.7 are of course also true for the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih)
to the particular delay VIEs (5.3.20) and (5.3.18).
5.3.7 Local superconvergence on geometric meshes
The special form of the delay function θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1) suggests that uit
h
might possibly attain the classical optimal order of superconvergence p∗= 2m
on a suitable geometric mesh, if collocation is at the Gauss points. That this is
(almost) so was veriﬁed in Brunner, Hu and Lin (2001). We brieﬂy describe
this result and sketch its proof.
Assume that Ih is a geometric mesh deﬁned by
Ih := {tn : tn = γ N−nT,
n = 0, 1, . . . , N;
γ ∈(0, 1)}.
(5.3.43)
As we shall see below, the mesh parameter γ will depend on N (but not on n),
on q, and on m. The mesh (5.3.43) possesses the following obvious properties:
(i) hn := tn+1 −tn = γ N−n−1(1 −γ )T
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1);
(ii) max(n) hn = hN−1 = (1 −γ )T (for any N ∈IN). Hence, γ = γ (N) will
have to be chosen so that γ →1, as N →∞, for all q ∈(0, 1).
Let ρ ∈IN be deﬁned by
ρ :=

ln(q)
ln(1 −2m ln(N)
(m+1)N )

:
(5.3.44)
it is the largest integer for which
q1/ρ ≤1 −2m · ln(N)
(m + 1)N .
Theorem 5.3.8 will reveal the motivation for introducing this integer ρ. Observe
that for given (ﬁxed) q ∈(0, 1) and m ≥1, we have ρ > 1 for all sufﬁciently
large N. This is true because
1 −2m · ln(N)
(m + 1)N −→1−,
as N →∞,

5.3 Second-kind VIEs with proportional delays
303
for any m ∈IN. The following is the result of Brunner, Hu and Lin (2001).
Theorem 5.3.8 Assume:
(a) g ∈C2m(I), K1 ∈C2m(D), K2 ∈C2m(Dθ);
(b) Ih is the geometric mesh described by (5.3.43) and (5.3.44), with γ = q1/ρ;
(c) uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is the collocation solution to the delay VIE (5.3.5), with the
{ci} given by the Gauss points, and uit
h denotes the corresponding iterated
collocation solution.
Then for all sufﬁciently large N the resulting local order of convergence of uit
h
is given by
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uit
h (t)| ≤C(q)N −(2m−εN ),
where
εN := logN

(2m · ln(N))2m
(2m + 1)(m + 1)2m

satisﬁes
lim
N→∞εN = 0.
Proof Since the proof is technically quite complex (using interpolatory pro-
jection techniques), we will only point to one of the key ingredients.
Lemma 5.3.9 Let Ih be the geometric mesh deﬁned by (5.3.43) and (5.3.44),
with γ = q1/ρ. Then:
(i) h0 ≤C N −2m/(m+1);
(ii)
N−1

n=1
h2m+1
n
≤C N −(2m−εN );
(iii) For ρ + 1 ≤n ≤N we have qtn = tn−ρ ∈Ih \ {0}.
Note that (iii) may be viewed as generalised θ-invariance of this geometric
mesh Ih.
Remarks
1. Geometric meshes similar to the ones employed here were introduced by Hu
(1998c) for piecewise polynomial collocation methods applied to VIDEs
with weakly singular kernels, to obtain local superconvergence of the collo-
cation solution on Ih.
2. The analysis in Brunner, Hu and Lin (2001) suggests that analogous super-
convergence results can be derived for collocation solutions in S(0)
m (Ih), with
suitable geometric mesh Ih, for Volterra integro-differential equations with

304
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
vanishing proportional delays. This has not yet been worked out in detail,
and hence the reader is invited to take up the challenge.
3. As Bellen (2001) has shown (see also the remark at the end of Section
5.2.5), the classical local superconvergence results on the mesh points Ih
can be revovered if one switches from uniform to quasi-geometric meshes.
We will not write down the details of this approach for second-kind VIEs
with proportional delays; the reader should be able to derive them from the
presentation in Sections 5.5.4 and 5.5.5.
5.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with
proportional delays
We have seen at the beginning of the present chapter that the analysis of the
existence and uniqueness of solutions becomes signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult when
we move from the ‘classical’ ﬁrst-kind integral equation in Volterra (1896a),
(Vy)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(5.4.1)
with K ∈C1(D), |K(t, t)| ≥κ0 > 0, g ∈C1(I), g(0) = 0, to the related de-
lay integral equation
(Wθ y)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)
K(t, s)y(s)ds = g(t),
t ∈I,
(5.4.2)
with lag function θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1). This is, as Volterra (1897) has de-
scribed (cf. (5.1.3)), closely related to the problem of analysing the solution of
the functional equation
y(t) −qy(qt) = f (t),
t ∈I.
This increase in complexity is even more pronounced in the convergence
analysis of collocation solutions for (5.4.2). Therefore, it will not come as a
surprise to the reader that the convergence analysis on uniform Ih is not yet
understood since, as we have already seen in Sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, even for
‘classical’ ﬁrst-kind VIEs (5.4.1) we cannot expect uniform convergence of uh
for arbitrary {ci}.
5.4.1 Collocation in S(−1)
m−1(Ih): uniform Ih
The collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to (5.4.2) with θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1)
is determined by
(Wθuh)(t) = g(t),
t ∈Xh,
(5.4.3)

5.4 Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with proportional delays
305
where, as in Section 5.3.2, the set Xh of collocation points now corresponds
to collocation parameters satisfying 0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1. Since we have
already done our homework at the end of Section 5.3.2, the precise form of
the collocation equations is already available: for t = tn,i ∈Xh we see that the
linear algebraic systems for Un in the local representation (5.3.10) have the
following forms:
Phase I
0 ≤n < q I (qn,i = n, γn,i > 0)
Here, (5.4.3) reduces to
¯B I
n(q)Un = h−1gn,
(5.4.4)
where the matrix ¯B I
n(q) was introduced in (5.3.24); the vector gn has the com-
ponents g(tn,i).
Phase II
q I ≤n < q I I (qn,i = n −1, i = 1, . . . , νn; qn,i = n, γn,i > 0
when i > νn)
A glimpse at (5.3.25) reveals that Un is now given by the system
¯B I I
n (q)Un = h−1gn −¯SI I
n−1(q)Un−1,
(5.4.5)
with the matrices ¯B I I
n (q) and ¯SI I
n−1(q) as in (5.3.25).
Phase III
q I I ≤n ≤N −1 (qn,i = qn < n −1, i = 1, . . . , νn; qn,i = qn +
1, γn,i > 0 when i > νn)
Since we have now reached the pure delay stage in the recursion, the left-hand
side matrix in these linear systems coincides with the one for the ‘classical’
ﬁrst-kind equation (5.4.1) and we obtain
BnUn = h−1gn −[ ¯SI I I
n
(q)Uqn +
n−1

ℓ=qn+1
B(ℓ)
n Uℓ+ SI I I

(5.4.6)
in complete analogy to (5.3.26) for the second-kind delay VIE of Section 5.3.3.
Example 5.4.1 uh ∈S(−1)
0
(Ih) (m = 1)
Here, we have q I = q I I. According to (5.4.3) and (5.3.24), the collocation
equation of Phase I (0 ≤n < q I) assumes the form
 c1
γn,1
K(tn,1, tn + sh)ds

yn+1 = h−1g(tn,1).
Since Phase II is empty, the collocation equation for Phase III (n ≥q I I = q I)
is given by
(Wθuh)(tn,1) =
 tn

K(tn,1, s)uh(s)ds +

K(tn,1, tqn,1 + sh)ds,
with qn,1 := ⌊q(n + c1)⌋and γn,1 := q(n + c1) −qn,1, the above difference
equation deﬁning the values {yn+1} becomes

ℓ=qn,1+1
B(ℓ)

qn (q)yqn,1+1 = h−1g(tn,1).
(5.4.7)
If K(t, s) ≡1 the delay integral equation (5.4.3) reduces to
 t
qt
y(s)ds = g(t),
t ∈I
(g(0) = 0),
and this is equivalent to the functional equation
y(t) −qy(qt) = g′(t),
t ∈I.
The corresponding collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
0
(Ih) is thus determined by
the solution of the difference equations
(c1 −γn,1)yn+1 = h−1g(tn,1) (0 ≤n < q I)
(5.4.8)
(for Phase I), and

(for Phase III; Phase II is empty). We will brieﬂy return to this in Section 5.4.3.
Note that Liu (1995b) analysed similar difference equations in the special case
where c1 = 1.

In order to illustrate the structure of the above difference equations corre-
sponding to collocation at the Gauss points (c1 = 1/2) we give a sample of
values of qn,1 and γn,1 (Tables 5.4 and 5.5). For comparison we also show a
sample of values of qn,1 and γn,1 for c1 = 1 (Tables 5.6 and 5.7).
If the given functions K and g in (5.4.2) satisfy the hypotheses stated in
Theorem 5.1.1, the existence of a unique collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to
(5.4.2), for all meshes with sufﬁciently small h > 0, can be established along
the lines of the analysis in Section 2.4.1, by proceeding from Phases I and II to
the ‘pure delay’ Phase III.

5.4.2 Convergence results for S(−1)
m−1(Ih) on uniform meshes
What can be said about the (order of) global convergence of the collocation
solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to (5.4.2)? Perhaps not surprisingly, we do not even
know sufﬁcient conditions on the {ci} for which uh converges uniformly to y
on I. Numerical evidence suggests that the condition
−1 ≤ρm := (−1)m
m

i=1
1 −ci
ci
≤1
(which guarantees uniform convergence when q = 0 in Wθ with θ(t) = qt;
see Section 2.4.2) is necessary but certainly no longer sufﬁcient for uniform
convergence. In particular, it is not even known for which values of c1 ∈(0, 1]
the solution of the simple difference equations (5.4.8) and (5.4.9) remains uni-
formly bounded as N →∞(h →0, Nh = T ) when q ∈(0, 1).
5.5 VIDEs with proportional delays
5.5.1 The collocation equations and their discretisations
We now study the convergence of collocation solutions for the delay VIDE with
proportional delay θ(t) := qt (0 < q < 1),
y′(t) = f (t, y(t), y(qt)) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I, y(0) = y0,
(5.5.1)
with V and Vθ denoting the nonlinear Volterra integral operators from C(I) to
C(I),
(Vy)(t) :=
 t

k1(t, s, y(s))ds,
t ∈I,
and
(Vθ y)(t) :=
 qt
0
k2(t, s, y(s))ds,
t ∈I.
(5.5.2)
The kernel functions ki (i = 1, 2) are supposed to be (Lipschitz-) continuous.
Hence, the derivation and the analysis of the collocation equation deﬁning
uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for (5.5.1),
u′
h(t) = f (t, uh(t), uh(qt)) + (Vuh)(t) + (Vθuh)(t),
t ∈I, uh(0) = y0,
(5.5.3)
are by now straightforward, since they will be based on the machinery intro-
duced in Sections 5.2. and 5.3. For ease of exposition we will often resort to
the linear version of (5.5.1), because it captures most of the essential features.

5.5 VIDEs with proportional delays
309
This delay VIDE is
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(qt) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),
t ∈I.
(5.5.4)
where a, b ∈C(I). The Volterra integral operators V and Vθ are the linear
counterparts of the above nonlinear operators, as deﬁned at the beginning of
Section 5.3. It will again be assumed that the kernels K1 and K2 deﬁning these
linear integral operators V and Vθ are continuous on their respective domains
D and Dθ.
Suppose now that the mesh Ih is uniform and that the local representation of
uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) on the subinterval ¯σn is

γn,i := q(n + ci) −qn,i ∈[0, 1).
Thus, at the collocation points tn,i := tn + cih (i = 1, . . . , m) the collocation

Employing the local representation (5.5.5) and letting t = tn,i := tn + cih in

above, where qn,i in Qqn,i(tn,i) now assumes the value n for all i.
(II) Transition phase (partial overlap)
q I ≤n < ⌈qcm/(1 −q)⌉=: q I I.
If this set of values of n is not empty there is an integer νn ∈{1, . . . , m −1} so

(5.5.13)
In order to understand the precise structure of these (seemingly) rather
complex algebraic systems, and to prepare the ground for the analysis of the

312
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
collocation error, we will use the linear VIDE with proportional delay (5.5.4)
to make the above collocation equations more transparent. The corresponding
systems of linear algebraic equations describing the three phases of the com-
putational form of the collocation equation are presented below. The reader
may ﬁnd it instructive to compare these systems with those corresponding to
‘classical’ linear Volterra integro-differential equations (Section 3.2.1) and the
ones encountered in Section 5.3.1 (cf. (5.3.12)–(5.3.14)).
We ﬁrst study the contributions arising from the classical (non-delay) VIDE
part, a(t)uh(t) + (Vuh)(t), and the delay part, b(t)uh(t) + (Vθuh)(t), separately.
Since the former was studied in Section 3.2, we can be brief: recall that, for all
values of n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1,
a(tn,i)uh(tn,i) + (Vuh)(tn,i)
= ha(tn,i)

The precise structure of the corresponding matrices and vectors will now of
course depend on the value ofqn,i: We haveqn,i = n in Phase I;qn,i ∈{n −1, n}
(Phase II); and qn,i ∈{qn, qn + 1}, with qn < n −1 (Phase III). Thus, let νn ∈
{0, 1, . . . , m} be such that, for given n,
qn,i =
qn
for i = 1, . . . , νn
qn + 1 (γn,i > 0)
for i = νn + 1, . . . , m.
The three phases I–III are then characterised by
qn,i =


qn + 1 = n
(νn = 0) :
Phase I
qn = n −1
(1 ≤νn < m) :
Phase II

(1 ≤νn ≤m) :
Phase III.
(5.5.18)
If we are in Phase II or Phase III, the equations (5.5.17) will in general split
into two separated forms: for qn,i = qn (i = 1, . . . , νn) we obtain

be written concisely as

ready to describe the linear algebraic systems corresponding to the three phases;
the deﬁnitions of the above matrices and vectors will then also become clear.

Combining (5.5.13) and (5.5.19) (with qn + 1 = n (νn = 0) and {∗} = {I}), the

(5.5.23)
We refrain from writing down the by now self-explanatory meanings of the
matrices and vectors describing the above linear algebraic system (5.5.23): a
brief look at (5.2.15) and the explicit equations (5.5.14) and (5.5.20) will help
the reader readily to do this.
Theorem 5.5.1 Assume that a, b and K1, K2 in (5.5.4) are continuous on their
respective domains I, D and Dθ. Then there exists an ¯h > 0 (depending on
q) so that for every uniform mesh Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h) the linear algebraic sys-
tems (5.5.21)–(5.5.23) have unique solutions Yn for any q ∈(0, 1); that is, the
collocation equation (5.5.3) corresponding to the linear DVIDE (5.5.4) deﬁnes
a unique collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) which on ¯σn is described by (5.5.5).

If K2 = −K1 =: −K, the (linear) delay VIDE (5.5.4) becomes
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(qt) + (Wθ y)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(5.5.24)
where the delay operator Wθ is as in (5.4.2). In the corresponding collocation
equation for uh ∈S(0)

h(t) = a(t)uh(t) + b(t)uh(qt) + (Wθuh)(t),

This allows us to write down the linear algebraic systems for Yn correspond-
ing to Phase I, II, and III (cf. (5.5.22)–(5.5.24) with K2 = −K1 =: −K), and
the collocation solution uh on any subinterval σn is then given by the local

Consider ﬁrst the linear VIDE

t ∈I = [0, T ],
y(0) = y0,

and θ(t) := qt, 0 < q < 1.
Theorem 5.5.2 Assume:
(a) The
given
functions
in
(5.5.27)
are
sufﬁciently
regular:
a, b ∈
Cm(I), K1 ∈Cm(D), and K2 ∈Cm(Dθ).
(b) For given uniform mesh Ih, uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the collocation solution to
(5.5.27).
Then for all h ∈(0, ¯h) and any set {ci} of distinct collocation parameters in
[0, 1] the collocation error eh := y −uh satisﬁes
||e(ν)
h ||∞≤Cν||y(m+1)||∞hm
(ν = 0, 1),
(5.5.28)
with constants Cν depending on the {ci} but not on h. This estimate is true for
any q ∈(0, 1).
Proof Consider the equation satisﬁed by the collocation error eh := y −uh,
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + (Veh)(t) + (Vθeh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(5.5.29)

(compare with (5.5.17)). As described in detail in Section 5.5.1, the value of
qn,i depends crucially on that of n and the corresponding phase: it is qn,i =
n (γn,i > 0) in Phase I; qn,i ∈{n −1, n} in Phase II (which may be empty); and
qn,i ∈{qn, qn + 1}, with qn < n −1, in Phase III. This leads to the three sets of
linear algebraic systems, in complete analogy to Section 5.2.2 and Section 5.3.2.
The proof of Theorem 5.5.2 is then achieved in a by now familar way. In order
not to become overly repetitive, we leave the details of the precise structure
of these algebraic systems and the derivation of the corresponding generalised
discrete Gronwall inequalities for ||En||1, and hence the completion of the proof
of Theorem 5.5.2, to the reader.
The proof of Theorem 5.2.2 shows that Theorem 5.5.3 can be modiﬁed in
a straightforward way to derive optimal global error estimates for solutions of
(5.5.4) possessing a lower degree of regularity:
Theorem 5.5.3 If y ∈Cd+1(I) with 1 ≤d < m (corresponding to the assump-
tion that a, b ∈Cd(I), K1 ∈Cd(D), K2 ∈Cd(Dθ)), then the optimal esti-
mates (5.5.28) have to be modiﬁed to read
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cd||y(d+1)||∞hd
(ν = 0, 1).
(5.5.32)

320
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
The key to the proof is again Peano’s Kernel Theorem and the corresponding
local error representations (5.5.32) and (5.5.31), with d + 1 replacing m + 1.
Remark Both Theorem 5.5.2 and the above observation regarding the order
of global convergence in the case of lower regularity in y include the special
delay VIDE (5.5.26),
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(qt) + (Wθ y)(t),
as well as its nonlinear counterpart
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)), y(qt)) +

(5.5.33)
Do the global and local superconvergence results we derived for classi-
cal VIDEs (Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4) and VIDEs with non-vanishing delays
(Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3) remain valid for VIDEs with vanishing proportional
delay? From what we have seen in this chapter, the answer will likely be in
the afﬁrmative for global convergence (as shown in Theorem 5.5.4). Regarding
local superconvergence on Ih the answer appears to be no if m > 2 (Conjecture
5.5.5), and this is supported by numerical evidence.
Theorem 5.5.4 Assume that the orthogonality condition J0 = 0 holds. If the
given data in the DVIDE (5.5.27) are in Cd with d ≥m + 1, then the attainable
order of global superconvergence of the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is,
for all q ∈(0, 1), described by
||y −uh||∞≤Chm+1.
Proof In order to exhibit the crucial steps leading to the above global super-
convergence result we will prove Theorem 5.5.4 for the delay VIDE
y′(t) = g(t) + (Vθ y)(t).
(cf. Section 5.1.4). The collocation error eh := y −uh solves the initial-value
problem
e′
h(t) = δh(t) + (Vθeh)(t),
t ∈I,
eh(0) = 0,
and hence, according to Theorem 5.1.6, it can be written as
eh(t) =
 t

δh(s)ds +
∞

k=1
 qkt
0
¯Hk(t, s)δh(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(5.5.34)
If we now compare the error representation (5.5.34) with (5.3.37), the one for
the iterated collocation error for second-kind VIEs with proportional delay,
we see that they possess an essentially identical structure, except that (5.5.34)

contains the additional term
 t

Hence, if we now approximate each integral over [0, 1] by interpolatory m-
point quadrature formulas based on the {ci}, the orthogonality condition J0 = 0
implies that the induced quadrature errors are O(hm+1). Furthermore, it follows
from
sup{|δh(tn + vh)| : v ∈[0, 1]} = O(hm)
that the argument used in the proof of Theorem 5.3.4 is now easily modiﬁed,
to yield the O(hm+1)-estimate of Theorem 5.5.4.
Conjecture 5.5.5 If d ≥m + 2 in Theorem 5.5.4, with m ≥2, and if the col-
location points Xh correspond to the Gauss points {ci}, then the optimal value
of p∗in the local estimate for the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to (5.5.27),
max
t∈Ih |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤Ch p∗,
is given by p∗= m + 2. This holds for all q ∈(0, 1), and the value m + 2 is
best possible.
5.5.3 Collocation on quasi-geometric meshes
Suppose that on some small initial subinterval [0, t0] of I := [0, T ] we have
computed, by some continuous method, an approximation y0 = y0(t) to the
solution y = y(t) of the initial-value problem for (5.5.1) with θ(t) = qt (0 <
q < 1), so that
||y −y0||0,∞:= max
t∈[0,t0] |y(t) −y0(t)| ≤C0t p0
0
(5.5.35)
for some p0 ≥1 to be speciﬁed later. We will assume that this initial interval
is deﬁned by setting
t0 = θ M(T ) for some
M ∈IN,
(5.5.36)
where θ M(T ) := (θ ◦θ ◦. . . ◦θ



M
)(T ) = q MT .
High-order approximations to the solution y of (5.5.1) on [0, t0] can be
generated either by computing the collocation solution vh ∈S(0)
m+r([0, t0]), using
the single subinterval [0, t0] and with the choice of r depending on the desired

322
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
order, or by resorting to the appropriate Taylor series for y (since on I the
solution y of (5.5.1) is smooth when the data are smooth).
The original initial-value problem (5.5.1) is now replaced by
z′(t) = f (t, z(t), z(θ(t))) + (Vz)(t) + (Vθz)(t),
t ∈¯I := [t0, T ],
(5.5.37)
z(t) = y0(t),
t ∈[θ(t0), t0] = [qt0, t0] ⊂(0, t0].
Since, by assumption, the delay θ does not vanish on the interval ¯I (recall
condition (D1) in Section 4.1.2) we introduce on ¯I the graded macro-mesh ¯
by
¯ := {ξµ : t0 = ξ0 < ξ1 < . . . < ξM = T,
ξµ := θ M−µ(T ) (0 ≤µ ≤M)},
(5.5.38)
with H (µ) := ξµ+1 −ξµ (µ = 0, 1, . . . , M −1) denoting the macro-steps. The
local meshes I (µ)
h
on the subintervals I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1] (µ = 0, 1, . . . , M −1)
are deﬁned by
I (µ)
h
:= {t(µ)
n
: ξµ = t(µ)
0
< t(µ)
1
< . . . < t(µ)
N

and we set
σ (µ)
n
:= [t(µ)
n , t(µ)
n+1],
h(µ)
n
:= t(µ)
n+1 −t(µ)
n ,
h(µ) := max{h(µ)
n
: 0 ≤n < N}.
For linear delays θ we will assume, without loss of generality, that the sub-
meshes I (µ)
h
are all uniform; that is, h(µ)
n
= h(µ) = Hµ/N (0 ≤n < N). The
corresponding mesh on ¯I,
¯I h :=

I (µ)
h ,
(5.5.39)
is then both constrained and θ-invariant, that is,
θ(I (µ+1)
h
) = I (µ)
h
(µ = 0, 1, . . . , M −1).
(5.5.40)
The collocation solution uh for the delay VIDE (5.5.1) will be an element of the
continuous piecewise polynomial space S(0)
m ( ¯I h). It is deﬁned by the collocation
equation
u′
h(t) = f (t, uh(t), uh(θ(t))) + (Vuh)(t) + (Vθuh)(t),
t ∈¯X h,

denotes the set of collocation points for the underlying θ-invariant mesh Ih.
Hence, the basic setting is the one for VIDEs with non-vanishing delays intro-
duced in Section 4.5.1, and we can employ that notation to put (5.5.41) into a
form that is feasible both for the subsequent convergence analysis and for the
numerical computation of uh. We employ the local Lagrange basis representa-
tion for uh on σ (µ)
n
= [t(µ)

Recall from Section 4.2.1 that if the delay θ(t) is linear, the set ¯X h of collocation
points is θ-invariant, too:
θ(X(µ+1)
h
) = X(µ)
h
(µ = 0, 1, . . . , M −1).
(5.5.44)
As we have already seen in Lemma 4.2.1, this is of course no longer true for
nonlinear delay functions θ(t).
The collocation equation (5.5.41) at t = t(µ)

:=

n,m)T ∈IRm of each nonlinear algebraic system (5.5.45). In order to
make this discussion more transparent we will derive these algebraic systems
in the case where the given VIDE (5.5.37) is linear:
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ y)(t),

respective domains D and Dθ, respectively. The resulting linear algebraic sys-
tems can be described in concise form if we introduce matrices in L(IRm) given
by

The exact collocation method in S(0)
m ( ¯I h) for the VIDE (5.5.1) with delay
function θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 0) can now be summarised as follows:
1. Choose a small initial interval [0, t0] deﬁned by t0 := θ M(T ) (cf. (5.5.36))
where M denotes an appropriate ‘large’ integer which will be speciﬁed in
Section 5.5.4.
2. The points ξµ := θ M−µ(T ) (µ = 0, 1, . . . , M), with ξ0 = t0, deﬁne the
macro-intervals I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1] and the macro-steps H (µ) := ξµ+1 −ξµ.
3. Introduce the local meshes I (µ)
h
:= {t(µ)
n
: ξµ = t(µ)
0
< t(µ)
1
< . . . < t(µ)
n
=
ξµ+1} (µ = 0, 1, . . . , M −1) on the intervals I (µ) and deﬁne the (con-
strained and θ-invariant) mesh on ¯I := [t0, T ] by (5.5.39). These local

326
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
meshes will often be chosen to be uniform: h(µ)
n
= h(µ) := H (µ)/N (n =
0, 1, . . . , N −1).
4. On the subinterval ¯σ (µ)
n
:= [t(µ)
n , t(µ)
n+1] the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m ( ¯I h)
to the delay VIDE (5.5.1) is determined by (5.5.43) and by the solutions
Y(µ)
n
of the algebraic systems (5.5.45) (or by (5.5.52) and (5.5.54) if the
delay VIDE is the linear equation (5.5.51)).
The existence of a unique collocation solution uh for (5.5.45) is guaranteed for
any sufﬁciently small h, say h ∈(0, ¯h), provided the given delay VIDE has a
unique solution y ∈C1(I). In the linear case this is obvious from the form of
the linear algebraic systems (5.5.52) and (5.5.54) (recall also Theorem 4.5.1).
In the nonlinear situation the assertion follows by the usual classical ﬁxed-point
argument.
5.5.4 Superconvergence results on quasi-geometric meshes
Suppose that the initial approximation y0(t) in [0, t0] satisﬁes (5.5.35) with
some feasible order p0 ≥m. How should t0 be determined? It is suggestive that
it be chosen so that
t0 = θ M(T ) = q MT ≤max
(n,µ) h(µ)
n
=: h.
(5.5.55)
If the local meshes I (µ)
h
are all uniform then
h = h(M−1) = H (M−1)/N = (T −θ(T ))/N = (1 −q)T/N.
(5.5.56)
It then follows that (5.5.55) holds if M in (5.5.36) is such that
θ M(T ) = q MT ≤(T −θ(T ))/N = (1 −q)T/N.
(5.5.57)
For the (linear) proportional delay θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1) we have θ(T ) = qT ,
and this leads to
M = M(q; N) ≥log(1 −q) −log(N)
log(q)
(5.5.58)
Hence, we choose
M = M(q; N) :=
log(1 −q) −log(N)
log(q)

(5.5.59)
(see Bellen (2001)). In order to obtain an idea on how large these values of M
deﬁning the number of macro-intervals are for speciﬁc values of q ∈(0, 1) and
N, the number of subintervals corresponding to each local mesh I (µ)
h , it may be
instructive to list a sample of such values (Table 5.8).

We will assume in the following that θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1) and that the
local meshes I (µ)
h
(0 ≤µ ≤M −1) are all uniform, with M in (5.5.36) sat-
isfying (5.5.58) (implying that t0 = O(h)). It then follows from the classical
convergence analysis of collocation methods for VIDEs with non-vanishing de-
lays (Section 4.5) that the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m ( ¯I h) for (5.5.1) induces
the estimates
max
t0≤t≤ξµ+1 |z(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h | ≤Cν(h(µ))m
(5.5.60)
for µ = 0, 1, . . . , M −1, and hence
||z(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞:= max
t∈¯I |z(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνhm
(ν = 0, 1),
(5.5.61)
for any choice of the m (distinct) parameters {ci}, provided the mesh Ih is given
by (5.5.39), and the exact solution z is in Cm+1(I (µ)) for µ = 0, 1, . . . , M −1.
These results are notparticularlyexcitingsinceweobtainedthesameorderof
global convergence on I by collocation on uniform meshes. However, since the
order of local superconvergence can apparently not exceed m + 2 on uniform
Ih (Conjecture 5.5.5), the use of these quasi-geometric meshes leads to the op-
timal local superconvergence results we derived for VIDEs with non-vanishing
delays.
Theorem 5.5.6 Assume
(a) a, b ∈Cm+1(I); K1 ∈Cm+1(D), K2 ∈Cm+1(Dθ); θ(t) = qt (0 < q <
1);
(b) uh ∈S(0)
m ( ¯I h) is the collocation solution deﬁned by (5.5.39), (5.5.54),

(c) ¯I h is the (constrained and θ-invariant) mesh deﬁned by (5.5.39) and
(5.5.40), with uniform local meshes I (µ)

so that h ∈(0, ¯h);
(d) p0 ≥m + 1 in (5.5.35), with M as in (5.5.59).

As we have indicated earlier, the principal motivation for employing appro-

to proportional delay VIDEs, with given initial approximation y0, is that we
can then resort to the results of Chapter 4 to allow us to generate collocation

In this case κ cannot exceed m −1.
Corollary 5.5.8 Let κ = m in Theorem 5.5.7: the (unique) {ci} are the m Gauss
points in (0, 1). Then for all q ∈(0, 1) the local estimate
max
t∈¯I h
|z(t) −uh(t)| ≤Ch2m
(5.5.67)
holds, while we only obtain
max
t∈¯I h\{ξµ} |z′(t) −u′
h(t)| = O(hm).

5.5 VIDEs with proportional delays

If κ = m −1, then collocation at the corresponding Radau II points (for which
cm = 1) yields
max
t∈¯I h\{ξµ} |z(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cνh2m−1
(ν = 0, 1).
(5.5.68)
Proof We proceed as in Section 4.5.3. The only difference is that now the
initial condition eh(0) = 0 is replaced by eh(t0) ̸= 0, and thus the initial-value
problem for eh := z −uh is
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + b(t)eh(θ(t)) + δh(t) + (Veh)(t) + (Vθeh)(t),
t ∈¯I,
eh(t) = ε0(t) for
t ∈[θ(t0), t0].
(5.5.69)
Here,
|ε0(t)| ≤C0t p0
0 ,
t ∈[0, t0],
(5.5.70)
by our assumption (5.5.34). Note that ε0(t) ≡0 if y0(t) coincides with the exact
solution y(t) of (5.5.1) for t ∈[0, t0].
The key to the proofs of the superconvergence results is again the variation-
of-constants formula for the representation of the (unique) solution of the initial-
value problem (5.5.69), in analogy to delay VIDEs with non-vanishing delays
treated in Chapter 4 (cf. Theorem 4.1.7). We now have

in (5.5.71). Thus, we have to show that, in spite of the
fact that M = M(N; q) = O(log(N)) and N →∞, the sums with upper limits
equal to µ −1 remain uniformly bounded. This central basic ingredient in the
subsequent convergence analysis is summarised in the following lemma (whose
proof is obvious).

5.5 VIDEs with proportional delays

In the remaining terms of (5.5.71) the integrals over the macro-intervals I (ν) are
broken down similarly into sums of (scaled) integrals over [0, 1] with factors
h(ν). Each of the integrals over [0, 1] is replaced by the sum consisting of the
m-point interpolatory quadrature approximation using the collocation points as
abscissas and the corresponding quadrature error Eµ,ν(t). Due to the orthog-
onality assumption (5.5.62) all these quadrature errors are of order O(hm+1)
since the integrands possess, by assumption on the given functions in (5.5.1),
the required (piecewise) regularity. The integral over [0, v] can be bounded by
h(µ) · const||δh||µ,∞= O((h(µ))m+1). Collecting all these estimates and invok-
ing Lemma 5.5.9 we readily establish the desired global O(hm+1)-estimate of
Theorem 5.5.6.
We now turn to the proof of Theorem 5.5.7. Here, we set t = t(µ)
n
in the
representation (5.5.71) of the collocation error eh(t(µ)
n ), and we employ again
m-point interpolatory quadrature formulas based on the collocation parameters
{ci} plus the corresponding error terms Eµ,ν(t), to replace the (scaled) integrals
over [0, 1]. To illustrate this, consider the sum in the third line of (5.5.71): it is
replaced by

It follows from the orthogonality conditions (5.5.64) (and the resulting degree of
precision of these quadrature formulas) and from the assumed regularity of the
given data that all quadrature errors are of order O(hm+r). Moreover, the sums
with upper limit µ −1 can again be bounded, uniformly in N and M, using
Lemma 5.5.9. The ﬁnal estimate (5.5.65) is now obtained in a straightforward
way, as is (5.5.66).
5.5.5 More general vanishing delays
The approach and the convergence results described in Sections 5.5.3 and 5.5.4
are not conﬁned to vanishing linear delay functions θ(t) = qt (0 < q < 1), but
they remain valid, with obvious modiﬁcations, if θ(t) is nonlinear and is such
that
(N1) θ ∈C1(I), with θ(0) = 0 and θ(t) < t for t > 0;
(N2) min
t∈I θ′(t) =: q0 > 0.

332
5 IVPs with proportional (vanishing) delay
Then – as we already brieﬂy indicated in Section 4.2.1 (Lemma 4.2.1) –
(5.5.43) is no longer valid: the set ¯X h of collocation points in no longer θ-
invariant. Hence the expression (5.5.48) for (Vθuh)(t(µ)
n,i ) in the collocation
equation (5.5.45) has to be modiﬁed. Since θ is strictly increasing on I we
have
θ(t(µ)

:= t(µ−1)

(5.5.74)
for some {˜ci} with 0 ≤˜c1 < . . . < ˜cm ≤1. (It is understood that the value of
each ˜ci depends on both n and µ: ˜ci = ˜ci(n; µ). For the sake of ease of notation
we will usually supress these arguments.) The θ-invariant mesh ¯I h on ¯I is still
given by (5.5.39) and (5.5.40). Since θ is nonlinear, this mesh ¯I h is no longer
quasi-geometric: we will call it quasi-graded.
Using again the local Lagrange representation (5.5.43) for uh ∈S(0)

The validity of the global and local superconvergence results of Theorems
5.5.6 and 5.5.7 hinges on the fact that, for such nonlinear delays θ the corre-
sponding θ-invariant mesh has, as for linear delays θ, the property that
h := max

H0 := max

h0 := H0/N = (1 −q0)T/N.
Assume in the following that one of the local meshes I (µ)
h , e.g. I (0)
h
or I (M−1)
h
, has
been prescribed; without loss of generality we will assume that this prescribed
mesh is uniform. Hence,
h(0)
n = h(0) := H (0)/N,
or
h(M−1)
n
= h(M−1) := H (M−1)/N.
Lemma 5.5.10 Let θ satisfy (N1) and (N2), and let θ0(t) := q0t. Then, under
the above hypotheses on the choice of I (0)
h
(or I (M−1)
h
), we have
H (µ) ≤H0 = (1 −q0)T
(µ = 0, 1, . . . , κ −1),
and
h(µ) ≤h0 = (1 −q0)T/N
(µ = 0, 1, . . . , M −1).
Proof The assertion is geometrically evident. Its analytical veriﬁcation is left
to the reader.
The above observations, including Lemma 5.5.10 and the (super-) convergence
arguments based on it, show that the linear pantograph VIDE (5.5.1), with q0
replacing q, is a representative test equation for a large class of VIDEs with
vanishing nonlinear delay functions θ.

5.7 Notes
5.1: Basic theory of functional equations with proportional delays
The book by Volterra (1913, pp. 85–88, 92–100) gives a detailed analysis of the
solvability of integral equations with proportional (and more general vanishing)
delays. This review is based on his own paper of 1997, as well as on work by
Picard (1907) (on functional equations of the form y(t) = g(t) + b(t)y(qt) +
(Vy)(t)), and Lalesco (1908, 1911). Hellinger and Toeplitz (1927) contains a
concise overview of this development. Volume 3 of Feny¨o and Stolle (1984) is,
tomyknowledge,theonly‘modern’bookthatdealswithpantograph-typeVIEs.
Compare also the papers by Chambers (1990), Pukhnacheva (1990), Denisov
and Lorenzi (1997) and Mure¸san (1999) for additional results for linear and
nonlinear second-kind VIEs with proportional delays.
First-kind VIEs with variable upper and lower limits of integration are the
subject of the monograph by Apartsin (2003).
The systematic study of the theory of the pantograph DDE and its various
generalisations began with the papers by Ockendon and Tayler (1971), Fox,
Mayers, Ockendon and Tayler (1971), and Kato and MacLeod (1971). These
DDEs almost immediately received much attention by researchers in analysis;
see, for example, the papers by Frederickson (1971), Kato (1972), Nussbaum
(1972), Carr and Dyson (1976), B´elair (1981), Derfel (1990, 1991), Kuang and
Feldstein (1990), Derfel and Molchanov (1990), Iserles (1993) (survey with
extensive list of references), Iserles (1994b), Terj´eki (1995), Iserles and Terj´eki
(1995), Derfel and Vogl (1996), Liu (1996a), Iserles (1997a), Iserles and Liu
(1997), Feldstein and Liu (1998). However, the reader may also wish to look at

the ‘early’ papers cited in Frederickson (1971), including the one by de Bruijn
(1953).
5.2: Collocation for DDEs with proportional delays
Numerical analysts remained singularly inattentive to the challenges of the
numerical analysis of pantograp-type DDEs: the fundamental paper by Fox et al.
(1971) on the numerical solution of the pantograph DDE (and its formulation as
Volterra functional equation) stood alone until the early 1990s, when Buhmann
andIserles(1991,1992,1993),Iserles(1993),andBuhmann,IserlesandNørsett
(1993) understood that this class of functional differential equations represents
a rich source of deep mathematical problems, both for the (theoretical and
computational) numerical analyst.
In the contributions just mentioned the focus was on the asymptotic prop-
erties of numerical approximations, by linear multistep and simple collocation
methods, for the pantograph equation (5.1.5). The survey by Iserles (1994a)
and the papers by Iserles (1994c, 1997a, 1997b), Y. Liu (1995a, 1995b, 1996a,
1996b, 1997), Liang and Liu (1996), Liang, Qiu and Liu (1996), Bellen,
Guglielmi and Torelli (1997), Carvalho and Cooke (1998), Koto (1999), Liang
and Liu (1999), Bellen (2001), Liu and Clements (2002), and Guglielmi and
Zennaro (2003) describe various extensions of these early stability results, both
on uniform and (quasi-) geometric meshes. Compare also the monograph by
Bellen and Zennaro (2003) for a survey of many of these results, and Brunner
(2003) for additional references.
Collocation methods and their (super-) convergence properties are consid-
ered in Buhmann, Iserles and Nørsett (1993) (for uh ∈S(0)
1 (Ih) and q = 1/2),
Brunner (1997a), Zhang (1998), Zhang and Brunner (1998), and Takama,
Muroya and Ishiwata (2000). While these properties are now reasonably well
understood, this is not true for the qualitative aspects of piecewise polynomial
(and continuous Runge–Kutta) methods: as shown in, e.g. Buhmann, Iserles
and Nørsett (1993) the present understanding is still at a very primitive level
(except possibly when q = 1/2).
5.3: Second-kind VIEs with proportional delays
Fox et al. (1971, pp. 292–295) used the integrated form of the pantograph
equation, i.e. a Volterra functional integral equation, to analyse the error induced
by a variant of the classical Lanczos τ-method. Collocation methods for Volterra
integral and integro-differential equations with proportional delays were stud-
ied in detail in Brunner (1997a), Zhang (1998), Brunner and Zhang (1998)

(2002), and Bellen et al. (2002). In these papers the focus is on the attainable
orders of global and local (super-) convergence in collocation solutions. See
also the survey by Brunner (2003).
As we mentioned before, the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of collo-
cation solutions to pantograph-type Volterra integral (and integro-differential)
equations is completely open.
5.4: Collocation for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with proportional delays
As we have already indicated in Section 5.4.2, the convergence analysis for
collocation solutions to pantograph-type VIEs of the ﬁrst kind is completely
open (see also Brunner (1997b). The same is of course true for the more general
ﬁrst-kind VIEs with vanishing delays (Denisov and Korovin (1992), Denisov
and Lorenzi (1995).
5.5: VIDEs with proportional delays
Piecewise polynomial collocation methods on uniform meshes for a rather
general class of VIDEs with proportional delays are studied in Ishiwata (2000);
her analysis (which focuses on the attainable order of the collocation solution
at t = h) generalises the ones in Brunner (1997a) and Takama, Muroya and
Ishiwata (2000). See also the sequel to this paper, Muroya, Ishiwata and Brunner
(2003).

Volterra integral equations with weakly
singular kernels
Volterra integral equations with weakly singular kernels (of algebraic or loga-
rithmic type) typically have solutions whose derivatives are unbounded at the
left endpoint of the interval of integration. Due to this singular behaviour the op-
timal global and local (super-) convergence results of Chapter 2 for collocation
solutions in piecewise polynomial spaces on uniform meshes will no longer be
valid. The use of appropriately graded meshes, or of non-polynomial colloca-
tion spaces on uniform meshes, are two of the possible alternative approaches
for dealing with this order reduction problem.

6.1.1 The Mittag-Lefﬂer function
In Chapter 1 we encountered the special linear initial-value problem
y′(t) = λy(t),
t ≥0,
y(0) = y0,
(6.1.1)
which is equivalent to the second-kind Volterra integral equation
y(t) = y0 +
 t
0
λy(s)ds,
t ≥0,
(6.1.2)
and whose solution is given by y(t) = exp(λt)y0. We then studied, in Chapter 5,
a delay variant of this problem,
y′(t) = λy(qt),
t ≥0,
y(0) = y0
(0 < q < 1),
(6.1.3)
or, equivalently,
y(t) = y0 +

(λ/q)y(s)ds,
t ≥0 :

while its solution is also smooth for all t ≥0, the analysis of the local supercon-
vergence properties of the corresponding collocation solutions is vastly more
complex.
Another variant of (6.1.2) and (6.1.4) arose in Chapter 4: for τ > 0 the
solution of
y(t) = y0 +
 t−τ
0
λy(s)ds,
t > 0,
corresponding to an arbitrarily smooth initial function φ in the initial condition
y(t) = φ(t), t ∈[−τ, 0], has low regularity at the points ξµ := µτ (µ ≥0).
Smoothing occurs at ξµ as µ increases.
In the present chapter we meet an entirely different non-smooth behaviour of
solutions. To illustrate this we choose as our starting point the VIE generalising
(6.1.2), i.e.
y(t) = g(t) + λ
 t
0
(t −s)−αy(s)ds,
t ≥0,
0 < α < 1,
(6.1.5)
with g(t) = y0. The (unique) solution can be found in explicit form generalising
the expression for the solution of (6.1.2), as shown in the following theorem
(due to Hille and Tamarkin (1930); see also Friedman (1963)).
Theorem 6.1.1 For any interval I := [0, T ] the unique solution y ∈C(I) of
the VIE (6.1.5) with 0 < α < 1 is given by
y(t) = E1−α(λ(1 −α)t1−α)y0,
t ∈I,
(6.1.6)
where
Eβ(z) :=
∞

k=0
zk
(1 + kβ)
(β > 0)
(6.1.7)
denotes the Mittag-Lefﬂer function.
Remark The Mittag-Lefﬂer function was introduced early in the 20th century
by the Swedish mathematician whose name it bears (see, e.g. his paper of 1903).
It is an entire function of order p = 1/β for any β > 0. For β = 1/2 we have
E1/2(±z1/2) = exp(z)[1 + erf(±z1/2)] = exp(z)erfc(±z1/2),
with
erf(x) :=
2
√π
 z
0
exp(−v2)dv
and
erfc(z) := 1 −erf(z)
denoting, respectively, the error function and the complementary error function.

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
For β = 1 we obtain of course E1(z) = exp(z). Additional properties and
applications can be found, for example, in Erd´elyi (1955) and, especially, in the
survey paper by Mainardi and Gorenﬂo (2000).
We do not prove Theorem 6.1.1 here since the result will be obtained as
a special case of Theorem 6.1.2 (see Corollary 6.1.4). Note that for α = 0
we recover the solution of (6.1.2), y(t) = E1(λt) = exp(λt). If α ∈(0, 1) the
solution of (6.1.5) is no longer smooth on I: according to (6.1.6) near t = 0+
its ﬁrst derivative behaves like
y′(t) = λy0t−α + (λ(1 −α))2
(2(1 −α)) y0t1−2α + · · · .
As we shall see in the next section this representation also reﬂects the general
situation: the solutions of general linear (and nonlinear) second-kind VIEs with
algebraic kernel singularity pα(t −s) (0 < α < 1), but otherwise smooth data,
are smooth on (0, T ] but have an unbounded ﬁrst derivative at t = 0; in the
terminology of Section 6.2.3, y lies in the H¨older space C1−α(I).
6.1.2 Linear VIEs of the second kind
The linear Volterra integral operators Vα : C(I) →C(I) we will consider in
this and the next chapter have as part of their kernels the weakly singular
(integrable) convolution factor
pα(t −s) :=
(t −s)−α
if 0 < α < 1,
log(t −s)
if α = 1.
(6.1.8)
(We note in passing that writing (t −s)α−1 instead of (t −s)−α is a seemingly
more obvious choice of notation. However, it will become clear that the one
chosen here will have certain advantages in our analysis.) Hence, Vα has the
form
(Vαφ)(t) :=
 t
0
pα(t −s)K(t, s)φ(s)ds,
t ∈I := [0, T ];
(6.1.9)
we will assume that K ∈C(D), with K(t, t) ̸= 0 for t ∈I. The nonlinear case
will be treated in Section 6.1.4.
Since the kernel Hα(t, s) := pα(t −s)K(t, s) in the corresponding linear
VIE,
y(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I,
(6.1.10)
is integrable on D, Picard iteration will lead to a uniformly and absolutely
convergent Neumann series with limit Rα(t, s), in analogy to Theorem 2.1.2.

6.1 Review of basic Volterra theory (III)

Hence, the solution of (6.1.10) will possess a representation similar to (2.1.11),
namely
y(t) = g(t) +
 t
0
Rα(t, s)g(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(6.1.11)
This is made more precise, ﬁrst for 0 < α < 1, in the following theorem.
Theorem 6.1.2 Assume that K ∈C(D), and let 0 < α < 1. Then for any g ∈
C(I) the linear, weakly singular Volterra integral equation (6.1.10) possesses a
unique solution y ∈C(I). This solution is given by (6.1.11): here, the resolvent
kernel Rα correspondingtothekernel Hα inheritstheweaksingularity(t −s)−α
and has the form
Rα(t, s) = (t −s)−αQ(t, s; α),
0 ≤s < t ≤T,
(6.1.12)
where
Q(t, s; α) :=
∞

n=1
(t −s)(n−1)(1−α)	n(t, s; α).
(6.1.13)
The functions 	n are deﬁned recursively by
	n(t, s; α) :=
 1

(1 −z)−αz(n−1)(1−α)−1K(t, s + (t −s)z)
	n−1(s + (t −s)z, s; α)dz
(n ≥2), with 	1(t, s; α) := K(t, s) and 	n(·, ·; α)∈C(D). Moreover, Q(·, ·; α)
solves the resolvent equations
Q(t, s; α) = K(t, s) + (t −s)α
 t

(t −v)−α(v −s)−αQ(t, v; α)K(v, s)dv

Proof The Picard iteration process for (6.1.10) deﬁnes an inﬁnite sequence
{yn(t)} by choosing y0(t) := g(t) and setting
yn(t) := g(t) + (Vαyn−1)(t),
t ∈I
(n ≥1).
In complete analogy to Section 2.1.1 the resulting iterated kernels Hn(t, s; α)
corresponding to Hα(t, s) := pα(t −s)K(t, s) =: H1(t, s; α) are obtained re-
cursively by

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
Using the variable transformation v = s + (t −s)z and an induction argument
it is easy to prove the following result on the form of the iterated kernels.
Lemma 6.1.3 Let 0 < α < 1 and K ∈C(D), with
¯K := max{|K(t, s)| :
(t, s) ∈D}. Then the iterated kernels {Hn(t, s; α)} corresponding to the ker-
nel H1(t, s; α) := Hα(t, s) in (6.1.9) can be written as
Hn(t, s; α) = (t −s)−α(t −s)(n−1)(1−α)	n(t, s; α) (n ≥2),
with
	n(t, s; α) :=
 1
0
(1 −z)−αz(n−1)(1−α)−1K(t, s + (t −s)z)
	n−1(s + (t −s)z, s; α)dz.
Moreover, the terms 
n(t, s; α) := (t −s)(n−1)(1−α)	n(t, s; α) can be bounded
uniformly by
|
n(t, s; α)| ≤¯K nT (n−1)(1−α) ((1 −α))n
(n(1 −α)).
We note in passing that the above uniform estimate for the iterated kernels
corresponding to the weakly singular kernel Hα(t, s) was already given by
Tychonoff (1938). The resulting uniform convergence of the Neumann series,
∞

n=1

n(t, s; α) =: Q(t, s; α),
(t, s) ∈D,
implies that Q(·, ·; α) ∈C(D) for all α ∈(0, 1). The representation (6.1.11)
then follows, thus generalising the analogous result (2.1.11) of Theorem 2.1.2.
To show that this solution y ∈C(I) given by (6.1.11) is unique, we observe
that the existence of another solution z ∈C(I) leads to
y(t) −z(t) = (Vα(y −z))(t) =
 t
0
Hα(t, s)[y(s) −z(s)]ds,
t ∈I.
Hence,
|y(t) −z(t)| ≤¯K
 t
0
pα(t −s)|y(s) −z(s)|ds,
t ∈I.
Since 0 < α < 1, the generalised Gronwall inequality dealt with in Theorem
6.1.17 yields, since γ (t) ≡0,
|y(t) −z(t)| ≤E1−α( ¯K(1 −α)t1−α) · 0 = 0 for all t ∈I.
The assertion regarding uniqueness of y thus follows from the continuity of
|y −z|.

Remark The ﬁrst proposition in Lemma 6.1.3 shows that the iterated kernels
Hn(t, s; α) become bounded (that is, continuous) on D when n ≥N = N(α):
it is easily veriﬁed that this value of N is N(α) = ⌈1/(1 −α)⌉.
Corollary 6.1.4 Let g ∈C(I) and 0 < α < 1. Then the (unique) solution y ∈
C(I) of the weakly singular VIE (6.1.5) can be written as

of (6.1.5) is
Rα(t, s) = d

(t, s) ∈D;
it can be written as

(λ(1 −α))n

	n(t, s; α) = λn ((1 −α))n
(n(1 −α)),
and hence
Hn(t, s; α) = 	n(t, s; α)(t −s)n(1−α)−1
(n ≥1).

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
since (1 + n(1 −α)) = n(1 −α)(n(1 −α)). The last statement in Corollary
6.1.4 follows by recalling that Eβ(0) = 1 for all β > 0.
For g(t) ≡1 we can explicitly compute the above integrals (note that the
inﬁnite series converges absolutely and uniformly on D), and this allows us to
derive the expression (6.1.6) for the solution of the special VIE (6.1.5).
We have seen in Section 2.1.1 that there exists an alternative representation
of the solution in terms of the ‘integrated’ resolvent kernel U(t, s) (cf. Theorem
2.1.4). This result extends to VIEs with weakly singular kernels.
Theorem 6.1.5 Assume that g ∈C1(I) and K ∈C(D), and let α ∈(0, 1).
Then the solution y ∈C(I) of (6.1.10) can be written as
y(t) = Uα(t, 0)g(0) +
 t
0
Uα(t, s)g′(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(6.1.15)
The function Uα = Uα(t, s) is related to the resolvent Rα = Rα(t, s) by
−∂Uα(t, s)
∂s
= Rα(t, s),
0 ≤s < t ≤T.
(6.1.16)
Proof Using integration by parts to rewrite the integral on the right-hand side
of (6.1.15) we derive

We already know from Theorem 6.1.2 that the VIE has a unique solution y ∈
C(I) for any α ∈(0, 1). Hence, by comparing the above expression for y with
the one in (6.1.11) we deduce that (6.1.16) must hold uniquely.
The proofs of the previous results on the resolvent representation of the
solution y of (6.1.10) also contain information on the regularity of y: for 0 <
α < 1 it conﬁrms that Theorem 6.1.1 in fact reﬂects the general qualitative
regularity behaviour of the solution of (6.1.10) near t = 0+.
Theorem 6.1.6 Assume that g ∈Cm(I) and K ∈Cm(D), with K(t, t) ̸= 0 on
I. Then:
(i) For any α ∈(0, 1) the functions 	n(t, s; α) (n ≥1) in (6.1.13) deﬁning
Q(t, s; α) lie in the space Cm(D), and the regularity of the unique solution
of the weakly singular VIE (6.1.10) is described by
y ∈Cm(0, T ] ∩C(I),
with
|y′(t)| ≤Cαt−α
for t ∈(0, T ].

(6.1.17)
Here, ( j, k)α := {( j, k) : j, k ∈IN0, j + k(1 −α) < m} and Ym(· ; α) ∈
Cm(I). The coefﬁcients γ j,k(α) are deﬁned in the proof below.
Proof The assertion regarding the regularity of y follows straightforwardly
from the proof of Theorem 6.1.2, since K ∈Cm(D) implies – by Lemma 6.1.3 –
that 	n(·, ·; α) possesses the same regularity: 	n(·, ·; α) ∈Cm(D) (n ≥1) for
any α ∈(0, 1).
Consider now the solution representation described by (6.1.11) and Theorem
6.1.2. By the uniform convergence of the inﬁnite series deﬁning Q(t, s; α) we

g and K that Gk(·, ·; α) ∈Cm(D) (k ≥1). Hence, by Taylor’s formula and by
employing the more convenient multi-index notation d := (d1, d2) (di ∈IN0),
with
|d| := d1 + d2,

where Ym(t; α) comprises those terms containing t j+k(1−α) with j + k(1 −α) ≥
m, and all Taylor remainder terms. This completes the proof of Theorem 6.1.6.
(Compare also Cerezo (1996) and Cao, Herdman and Xu (2003) for a repre-
sentation very similar to (6.1.17) and for an alternative proof.)
Remark If the given functions g and K are (real) analytic in their domains,
then it can be shown (see Lubich (1983a) that there is a function Y = Y(z1, z2),
real and analytic at (0, 0), so that solution of the VIE (6.1.10) (0 < α < 1) can
be written as y(t) = Y(t, t1−α). Related regularity results can be found in the
papers by Miller and Feldstein (1971) and de Hoog and Weiss (1974).
The existence and uniqueness of a solution y ∈C(I) of (6.1.10) is also guar-
anteed if the kernel singularity is of logarithmic type, p1(t −s) := log(t −s).
We summarise this in the following theorem (but leave its proof as an exercise).
Theorem 6.1.7 Let α = 1 and K ∈C(D) in (6.1.10). Then for any g ∈C(I)
the VIE
y(t) = g(t) +

with |y′(t)| ≤C| log(t)|,

If in addition we assume that g ∈Cm(I), K ∈Cm(D) (m ≥1), with
K(t, t) ̸= 0 on I, then the solution lies in Cρ(I) whenever 1 ≤ρ < m, while
y(ρ+1)(t) near t = 0+ behaves like t−α. If ρ ≥m then y ∈Cm(I).
Remark In Section 6.2.3 we will adopt the more concise (classical) notation
to describe the regularity properties of solutions to VIEs with weakly singular
kernels of algebraic type, by introducing the notion of a H¨older space. In that
terminology, the regularity result in the above theorem will read: y ∈Cρ,1−α(I),
with 1 ≤ρ < m.
Theorem 6.1.8 yields an obvious generalisation of the result we met in
Corollary 6.1.4, namely:
Corollary 6.1.9 Assumethat g ∈C(I),andletν := ρ−α(ρ ∈IN, 0 < α < 1).
Then the (unique) solution of the integral equation

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
The last statement in this theorem will often form the basis for ﬁnding the
solutions of somewhat more general VIEs with weakly singular kernels, in com-
plete analogy to Theorem 2.1.6 for second-kind VIEs with regular convolution
kernels. A particular case corresponds to the choice k(t −s) = pα(t −s) (0 <
α ≤1).
The next result (extending Theorem 2.1.6) puts Corollary 6.1.9 into a some-
what more general context.

Proof We leave it as an exercise. The reader is also referred to Bellman and
Cooke (1963).
The ﬁnal result in this section forms the basis for analysing the effect of a
non-smooth function g on the regularity of the solution of the weakly singular
VIE (6.1.10).
Theorem 6.1.11 Let g(t) = g1(t) + tβg2(t), with gi ∈C(I) (i = 1, 2) and
β > 0 (β ̸∈IN), and assume that K ∈C(D). Then the (unique) solution y ∈
C(I) of (6.1.10) with this function g can be written as

Remarks
1. The statement of Theorem 6.1.11 yields a regularity result for the solution of
(6.1.10) corresponding to g1(t) ≡0. An obvious modiﬁcation of Theorem
6.1.6 and its proof then leads to the analogue of the representation (6.1.17)
of y. See also Exercise 6.6.6.

t ∈I
(0 < α ≤1),

is integrable, it can be shown in a straightforward way that the existence and
uniqueness result of Theorem 2.1.10 remains valid: however, the number δ0
deﬁning the existence interval I0 now depends on α. We leave the proof as
an exercise (Exercise 6.6.5) and instead consider brieﬂy the Hammerstein-type
Volterra equation
y(t) = g(t) + (Hαy)(t),
t ∈I,
(6.1.23)
where the weakly singular Volterra–Hammerstein operator is
(Hαy)(t) :=
 t
0
pα(t −s)K(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds.
The functions pα and K are subject to the assumptions stated at the beginning
of Section 6.1.2, and G : I ×  ⊂IR→IRis smooth.

to cover the above VHIE with weakly singular kernel: with the Niemytzki
operator N as in (2.1.44),
z(t) := (N y)(t) = G(t, y(t)),
(6.1.23) yields an implicitly linear VIE for z,
z(t) = G(t, g(t) + (Vαz)(t)),
t ∈I,
(6.1.24)
and this is followed by the recursion
y(t) = g(t) + (Vαz)(t),
t ∈I.

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
The operator Vα is our linear, weakly singular Volterra integral operator,
(Vαz)(t) :=
 t
0
pα(t −s)K(t, s)z(s)ds.
We will return to this reformulation in Section 6.2.11.
The analysis of second-kind VIEs with weakly singular kernels and Ham-
merstein nonlinearities has its origin in the early 1950s. Such equations arise
in the modelling of one-dimensional heat ﬂow with radiation cooling at the
boundary, and they typically have the form
y(t) =
 t
0
(t −s)−αG(y(s))ds,
with G(y) = γ (1 −yν); (γ > 0, ν = 4). Mann and Wolf (1951) showed that
for α = 1/2, the solution y is increasing and satisﬁes
0 < y(t) < 1 (t > 0),
and
lim
t→∞y(t) = 1.
These results were extended by Roberts and Mann (1951) to arbitrary α ∈(0, 1),
and by Padmavally (1958) to nonlinearities G(s, y(s)). The papers by Nohel
(1964, 1976) and Miller (2000) survey this development and contain additional
references.
6.1.4 Linear VIEs of the ﬁrst kind

(6.1.28)
has a continuous derivative on (0, T ]. This is certainly true if g ∈C1(I) (I :=
[0, T ]); if, in addition, we have g(0) = 0 then the solution y lies in C(I) and is

We summarise Abel’s result in the following theorem.
Theorem 6.1.12 Let g ∈C1(I). Then for any α ∈(0, 1) the Abel integral equa-
tion (6.1.26) possesses a unique continuous solution on (0, T ]. This solution

(6.1.29)
In his Nota II of 1896, Vito Volterra extended both his approach of Nota I
and Abel’s result (and his key idea in the proof) of 1823/26 to the more general
ﬁrst-kind integral equation
(Vαy)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I = [0, T ] (0 < α < 1),
(6.1.30)
with Vα as in (6.1.9) and g(0) = 0. He showed, by multiplying the equation
by (z −t)α−1 and then integrating with respect to t over [0, z], that the given
equation (6.1.31) can be written as a ﬁrst-kind VIE with regular (bounded)
kernel,
 t
0
H(t, s; α)y(s)ds = Gα(t),
t ∈I,
(6.1.31)
where Gα is the function deﬁned in (6.1.28) and
H(t, s; α) :=
 1
0
K(s + (t −s)v, s)
vα(1 −v)1−α
dv.
Observe that this kernel H(·, ·; α) inherits the regularity of the original kernel
K: if K ∈Cm(D) then H(·, ·; α) ∈Cm(D). Moreover, H(t, t; α) = K(t, t)/γα.
We shall return to these facts in Theorems 6.1.13 and 6.1.14.
The following theorem contains Volterra’s fundamental result (Volterra
(1896a, Nota II)).
Theorem 6.1.13 Assume that
(a) g ∈C1(I), with g(0) = 0;
(b) K ∈C(D), ∂K/∂t ∈C(D), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 when t ∈I.
Then for any α ∈(0, 1) the following is true:
(i) Theﬁrst-kindVIE(6.1.30)possessingtheweaklysingularkernel Hα(t, s) :=
(t −s)−αK(t, s) is equivalent to the ﬁrst-kind VIE (6.1.31) with bounded
kernel H(t, s; α) and with non-smooth right-hand side Gα(t).

354
6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
(ii) The kernel H(t, s; α) and the right-hand side Gα(t) satisfy the hypotheses
for K(t, s) and g(t) in Theorem 2.1.8, and hence the given VIE (6.1.30)
possesses a unique solution y ∈C(I).
We leave the proof as a simple exercise. It makes use of the fact that
 1
0
vµ−1(1 −v)ν−1dv = B(µ, ν) = (µ)(ν)
(µ + ν)
(µ, ν > −1),
where B(·, ·) denotes Euler’s beta function (see, e.g. Henrici (1962, pp. 24–62)).
We shall see in Theorem 6.1.14 that while the solution y is continuous on
the interval [0, T ], its derivative near t = 0+ will behave like tα−1, for any
non-trivial Cd-data with d ≥2.
Due to this equivalence between the ﬁrst-kind VIE with weakly singular
kernel and smooth right-hand side, and a ﬁrst-kind VIE with smooth kernel
but non-smooth right-hand side, the proof of Theorem 2.1.9 can be adapted to
yield an analogous regularity result for the weakly singular VIE (6.1.31). Note,
however, that since Gα is smooth only on the left-open interval (0, T ], the same
will be true of the solution y when g and K are smooth. In other words, as the
previous theorem already suggests, the regularity of Gα(t) at t = 0 will depend
on the values of g(ν)(0) (ν ≥0).
In order to make this more precise we recall the deﬁnition of the Pochhammer
symbol,
(α)k := α(α + 1) · · · (α + k −1),
k ≥1 (k ∈IN).
Theorem 6.1.14 Assume:
(a) g ∈Cm+1(I);
(b) K ∈Cm+1(D), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 when t ∈I;
(c) g(ν)(0) = 0 for ν = 0, 1, . . . , q (q < m).
Then the unique solution of (6.1.30) lies in the space Cq(I) ∩Cm(0, T ] for all
α ∈(0, 1), and |y(q+1)(t)| ≤Ctα−1 on (0, T ].
For q = 0 the solution of (6.1.30) has a representation similar to (6.1.17) in
Theorem 6.1.6, with α replacing 1 −α.
In the terminology to be introduced in Section 6.2.3 the solution lies in the
H¨older space Cq,α(I).
The proof of Theorem 6.1.14 is based on the observation that, by (c), the
function Gα in (6.1.27) can be written as
Gα(t) =
1
(α)q+1
 t
0
(t −s)q+αg(q+1)(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(6.1.32)
Hence it follows that Gα ∈Cq+1(I), with G(ν)
α (0) = 0 (ν = 0, . . . , q).

and Stolle (1984).
We continue by brieﬂy touching upon the ﬁrst-kind Abel-type VIE corre-
sponding to the ‘non-standard’ Volterra–Abel integral operator

(h(t) −h(s))−αK(t, s)φ(s)ds,

(6.1.33)
with K ∈C(D), K(t, t) ̸= 0 (t ∈I, and h ∈C1(I), h′(t) > 0 (t > 0). In
many applications (see, e.g. Anderssen (1977) and its bibliography) we have
h(t) = t p, p > 1. In this case we will denote the corresponding integral oper-
ator (6.1.29) by Ap,α.
The following theorem is concerned with this particular case; it is readily
extended to encompass the general case, and the reader may wish to consult
Schmeidler(1950),Sneddon(1972),Anderssen(1976,1977),andHung(1979).
The regularity result (ii) is due to Atkinson (1974a) (see also Lubich (1987)). In
addition, compare Smarzewski and Malinowksi (1978, 1983) where Volterra–

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
Theorem 6.1.15 Consider the Abel-type integral equation
(Ap,αy)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ] (0 < α < 1, p > 1).
Assume that g ∈C1(I) and K ∈C1(D), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 for t ∈I.
(i) If K(t, t) ≡1 then the (unique) solution y ∈C(0, T ] of (Aαy)(t) = g(t) is
given by the inversion formula

t ∈(0, T ].
(ii) If g(t) = g0(t)tβ, with g0 ∈Cm+1(I) and β > −pα, and K ∈Cm+1(D),
then the solution is of the form
y(t) = t pα+β−1[c0 + tφ0(t)],
t ∈(0, T ],
where φ0 ∈Cm(I) and c0 = 0 if, and only if, g0(0) = 0.
We conclude with a remark on the fundamental difference between the in-
tegral operators Vα and Ap,α (0 < α < 1, p > 1); we illustrate this with the
example p = 2, α = 1/2 and K(t, s) ≡1 (see also Atkinson (1997a), p. 20).
If we deﬁne φβ(t) := tβ, direct computation shows that, for any β ≥0, β ∈IR,
(A2,1/2φβ)(t) =
 t

(t2 −s2)−1/2φβ(s)ds = λβφβ(t),
t ∈I,
with (A2,1/2φ)(0) := 0 and
λβ :=

(1 −s2)−1/2sβds ∈(0, π/2].
In other words, the integral operator A2,α (0 < α < 1) has a continuous spec-
trum σ(A2,α) = (0, π/2]. This is equivalent to the statement that A2,1/2 is not
a compact operator from C(I) →C(I). Thus, not surprisingly, the analysis
of piecewise collocation methods for ﬁrst-kind and second-kind integral equa-
tions described by such Abel-type operators is considerably more complex; it
remains essentially open (Exercise 6.6.17).
6.1.5 Nonlinear VIEs of the ﬁrst kind
As we shall see in Chapter 8, nonlinear VIEs of the ﬁrst kind occur for example
in systems of integral-algebraic equations, replacing the algebraic constraints
in a DAE (Chapter 8). Their kernel functions are usually of Hammerstein type,

6.1 Review of basic Volterra theory (III)

and hence we will restrict our present discussion to VIEs of the form
(Hαy)(t) :=
 t

pα(t −s)K(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds = g(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ] (0 ≤α ≤1),
(6.1.34)
with g(0) = 0 and K(t, t) ̸= 0 on I.
The following result is due to Deimling (1995). Related results can be found
in Gladwin and Jeltsch (1974), Branca (1976, 1978), and Dixon, McKee and
Jeltsch (1986).
Theorem 6.1.16 Assume:
(a) g ∈C1(I), with g(0) = 0;
(b) K ∈C1(D), with |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0, t ∈I;
(c) G : I × IR→IRis continuous and satisﬁes
(G(t, y) −G(t, z))(y −z) > 0,
t ∈I, y, z ∈IR (y ̸= z);
(d)
lim
|y|→∞
G(t, y)y
|y|
→∞(t ∈I).
Then the nonlinear Volterra–Hammerstein equation (6.1.34) possesses a unique
solution y ∈C(I) for any α ∈[0, 1). For 0 < α < 1 and sufﬁciently regular
functions g, K and G its regularity properties coincide with those described in
Theorem 6.1.14. In particular, if g′(0) ̸= 0 then |y′(t)| ≤Ctα−1 near t = 0+.
Remark The above result remains valid for systems of ﬁrst-kind Volterra–
Hammerstein integral equations when the products and absolute values are
replaced, respectively, by the standard inner product in IRm and the induced
Euclidian norm (see Deimling (1995) and Section 8.1.2).
Proof Since 0 < α < 1 we can adopt Volterra’s idea of rewriting the given
VIE as an equivalent, now nonlinear, ﬁrst-kind equation with bounded kernel
function. Recalling the remarks preceding Theorem 6.1.13 this VIE is
 t

 t

∂H(t, s; α)

G(s, y(s))ds = G′

(6.1.36)
Since by (b) (see also (ii) in Theorem 6.1.13)) we have H(t, t; α) ̸= 0 on I, we
have to show that this implicit second-kind VIE has a unique continuous solution

358
6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
on I. To this end, set z(t) := G(t, y(t)) and consider the integral equation
z(t) = Fα(t) +

H1(t, s; α)z(s)ds,
t ∈I,

where
Fα(t) := G′
α(t)/H(t, t; α),
H1(t, s; α) := −[∂H(t, s; α)/∂t]/H(t, t; α).
It follows from the theory of linear second-kind VIEs and assumptions (a), (b)
that there exists a unique z ∈C(I) solving (6.1.35). The unique solvability of
G(t, y(t)) = z(t),
t ∈I,
is now a consequence of the assumptions (c) and (d).
6.1.6 Weakly singular Volterra equations with
non-vanishing delays
Let θ be a delay function satisfying the conditions (D1)–(D3) of Section 4.1.2:
(D1) θ(t) = t −τ(t), τ ∈Cd(I) for some d ≥0;
(D2) τ(t) ≥τ0 > 0 for t ∈I;
(D3) θ is strictly increasing on I.
Here, we assume that I := [t0, T ] for some t0 ≥0.
For given θ and α ∈(0, 1] we deﬁne the Volterra integral operator Vθ,α by
(Vθ,αy)(t) :=
 θ(t)
0
pα(t −s)K2(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(6.1.38)
where K2 ∈Cd(Dθ) for some d ≥0. We also introduce
(Wθ,αy)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)
pα(t −s)K(t, s)ds,
t ∈I.
How does a non-vanishing delay affect the regularity of the solutions of the
second-kind VIEs
y(t) = g(t) + (Vy)(t) + (Vθ,αy)(t),
t ∈I,
(6.1.39)
and
y(t) = g(t) + (Wθ,αy)(t),
t ∈I,
with y(t) := φ(t) if t ≤0, when all the given functions are smooth, e.g. have
continuous derivatives of order m on their respective domains?

extend those described in Section 4.1.2 (Table 4.1). The proofs are left as an
exercise.
6.1.7 Comparison theorems and Gronwall-type inequalities
We conclude this look at the theory of weakly singular Volterra integral equa-
tions by describing a number of generalisations of the continuous and discrete
comparisons theorems of Sections 2.1.8 and 2.1.9. These results (as well as
more general variants) are due to McKee (1982a), Beesack (1985a, 1985b),
and Dixon and McKee (1986); see also McKee and Tang (1991).
We start with an extension of the classical result of Gronwall.
Theorem 6.1.17 Let I := [0, T ] and assume that
(a) g ∈C(I), g(t) ≥0 on I, and g is non-decreasing on I.

Theorem 6.1.18 Assume that g ∈C(I), with g(t) ≥0 on I, and K ∈C(D),
with K(t, s) ≥0 on D. Let Rα(t, s) = (t −s)−αQ(t, s; α) denote the resolvent
kernel associated with

6.2 Collocation for weakly singular VIEs of the
second kind
6.2.1 The exact collocation equations
As in Section 6.1.2 let the linear Volterra integral operator Vα : C(I) →C(I)
be given by
(Vαy)(t) :=
 t
0
Hα(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(6.2.1)
with
Hα(t, s) := pα(t −s)K(t, s),
0 < α ≤1.
(6.2.2)
The kernel function K = K(t, s) is assumed to satisfy K ∈C(D) and K(t, t) ̸=
0 on I, and the integrable (weak) singularity pα has the form
pα(t −s) :=
(t −s)−α
if 0 < α < 1,
log(t −s)
if α = 1.
(6.2.3)
Given a function g ∈C(I) we shall approximate the solution of the weakly
singular VIE
y(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I,
(6.2.4)
by collocation in the piecewise polynomial space
S(−1)
m−1(Ih) := {v : v|σn ∈πm−1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}.

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
The desired collocation solution uh is therefore deﬁned by
uh(t) = g(t) + (Vαuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(6.2.5)
where the set of collocation points,
Xh := {tn + cihn : 0 ≤c1 < · · · < cm ≤1 (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1)}, (6.2.6)
is determined by the given mesh Ih and the (distinct) collocation parameters
{ci}. As we have already observed at the beginning of Section 2.2.2, the choice
c1 = 0 and cm = 1 (m ≥2) implies, for continuous g and K, that
uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) ∩C(I) = S(0)
m−1(Ih),
with dim S(0)
m−1(Ih) = N(m −1) + 1. In this case we require uh to satisfy the
the initial condition uh(t0,1) = uh(0) = g(0).
The iterated collocation solution uit
h corresponding to the collocation solu-
tion uh is then deﬁned by
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Vαuh)(t),
t ∈I.
(6.2.7)
It trivially satisﬁes
uit
h (t) = uh(t)
for all
t ∈Xh
and for any α ∈(0, 1].
As in Chapter 2, the computational form of the collocation equation (6.2.5)
will again be based on the local representation employing the Lagrange basis
functions with respect to the collocation parameters {ci} which we will recall
for convenience: setting
L j(v) :=
m
	
k̸= j
v −ck

and
Un, j := uh(tn + c jhn) ( j = 1, . . . , m),
the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)

Due to the integrability of the kernel Hα in the Volterra integral operator Vα
it is clear that the result of Theorem 2.2.1 on the existence and uniqueness of
the collocation solution uh remains valid for any α ∈(0, 1].
Theorem 6.2.1 Assume that g and K in Hα(t, s) = pα(t −s)K(t, s) are con-
tinuous on their respective domains I and D. Then there exists an ¯h = ¯h(α) > 0
so that, for every α ∈(0, 1] and any mesh Ih with mesh diameter h satisfying
h ∈(0, ¯h), each of the linear algebraic systems (6.2.13) has a unique solution
Un ∈IRm (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1). Hence the collocation equation (6.2.5) de-
ﬁnes a unique collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for the weakly singular VIE
(6.2.4), with local representation given by (6.2.8).
Proof By our assumptions on the factor K in the kernel Hα of the Volterra
operator Vα, the elements of the matrices Bn(α) in (6.2.12) are bounded for
all α ∈(0, 1]. As in the case α = 0 this implies that the inverse of the matrix
Bn(α) := Im −hn Bn(α) ∈L(IRm) exists if hn||Bn(α)|| < 1 for some matrix
norm. This clearly holds whenever hn is sufﬁciently small. In other words,
there is an ¯h = ¯h(α) > 0 so that for any mesh Ih with h := max{hn : 0 ≤
n ≤N −1} < ¯h, each matrix Bn(α) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1) has a uniformly
bounded inverse. The assertion of Theorem 6.2.1 now follows.
When the collocation solution on the subinterval σn has been computed, the
iterated collocation solution for t = tn + vhn ∈¯σn := [tn, tn+1] is given by

w(ℓ)
n, j(v; 0) = β j(1) = b j, respectively (cf. (2.2.19), (2.2.20)).
We observe in passing that the integrals Q(ℓ)
n (α)uh)(t) (ℓ< n) in the lag term
(6.2.10) could, of course, also be discretised by the ‘classical’ (i.e. non-product)
interpolatory quadrature formulas used in Section 2.2.3, since pα(tn + vhn −
tℓ−shℓ) is now bounded for v ∈(0, 1] when ℓ< n.
The fully discretised collocation equation is obtained from the exact col-
location equation (6.2.9) by replacing the integrals by the above quadrature
approximations, disregarding the quadrature errors induced by this secondary
discretisation process. As in Section 2.2.3 we will denote the resulting discre-
tised collocation solution by ˆuh: it is, of course, still an element of our space
S(−1)
m−1(Ih), but in general we have ˆuh ̸= uh. The local representation of ˆuh on σn

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
The collocation solution is now determined by the corresponding system
(6.2.13) in IR2 and the local Lagrange representation (6.2.8) with m = 2, and
(6.2.16) yields the iterated collocation solution on ¯σn.
6.2.2 The fully discretised collocation equations
The integrals occurring in the collocation equation (6.2.9), and in (6.2.10) and
(6.2.16), usually cannot be found analytically but have to be approximated by
suitable numerical quadrature formulas, similar to the situation we have already
encountered in Section 2.2.3. Now, due to the presence of the weak singularity
pα(t −s) it will be natural, as we shall see below, to base this further discretisa-
tion step on (interpolatory) product quadrature formulas whose weights depend
on the weakly singular factor pα(t −s) in the kernel Hα(t, s).
Thus, the fully discretised version of (6.2.5) will be
ˆuh(t) = g(t) + ( ˆVα,h ˆuh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(6.2.19)
where ˆVα,h denotes the discrete version of the original Volterra integral operator
Vα in (6.2.4). The weighted interpolatory m-point quadrature formulas (which
we will refer to simply as m-point product quadrature formulas) whose ab-
scissas are given by, or based on, the m collocation parameters {ck} and whose
weights depend on pα will be employed to generate the quadrature approxima-

propriately redeﬁned matrix ˆBn(α).
Theorem 6.2.2 Let the assumptions of Theorem 6.2.1 hold. Then there exists
an ˆh = ˆh(α) > 0 so that for α ∈(0, 1] and any mesh Ih with mesh diameter h
satisfying h ∈(0, ˆh) there exists a unique discretised collocation approximation

m−1(Ih) deﬁned by the unique solutions ˆUn of the linear algebraic systems
(6.2.27) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1) and the local representations (6.2.24).
The proof of Theorem 6.2.2 of course closely resembles the one for Theo-
rem 6.2.1: since, for any ﬁxed m and any α ∈(0, 1], the weights {wn,k(ci; α)}
characterising the elements of ˆBn(α) are bounded, it follows from the con-
tinuity of K and the Neumann Lemma that each matrix Im −hn ˆBn(α)

6.2.3 Approximation of functions in H¨older spaces and
graded meshes
We brieﬂy mentioned in Section 2.2.1 that graded meshes would play an impor-
tant role in the computation and convergence analysis of collocation methods
for Volterra equations with weakly singular kernels. The regularity results of
Section 6.1 indicate why this will be so: typically, the ﬁrst derivative of so-
lutions of second-kind VIEs with smooth data behave like t−α if 0 < α < 1,
or like t · log(t) if α = 1, near t = 0+. Thus, it is intuitively clear that collo-
cation in piecewise polynomial spaces based on uniform meshes Ih will, due
to the lack of regularity in y at t = 0, lead to low orders of (global or local)
convergence.
We recall from Section 2.2.1 that for an interval I := [t0, T ] a graded mesh
with grading exponent r > 1 is deﬁned by
Ih := {tn = t(N)
n
:= t0 + (n/N)r(T −t0) : n = 0, 1, . . . , N}.
(6.2.31)
The sequence {hn := tn+1 −tn (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1)} is strictly increasing,
and its mesh diameter is given by h = hN−1.
In this chapter we will assume that t0 = 0; graded meshes corresponding to
more general t0 will be encountered in Sections 6.4 and 7.4.2. The following
elementary lemma summarises the key properties of graded meshes.

6.2 Collocation for weakly singular VIEs of the second kind
371
Lemma 6.2.3 Let Ih be a graded mesh of the form (6.2.31), with t0 = 0. Then:
(a) tn = nrt1
(n = 1, . . . , N),
with t1 = h0 = T N −r.
(b) h = hN−1 = rT N −1(1 −θ N −1)r−1 ≤rT N −1, for some θ ∈(0, 1).
(c) h/h0 = r Nr−1(1 −θ N −1)r−1 for some θ ∈(0, 1).
The grading exponent r = r(α) > 1 of the meshes that will be employed
in this and the next chapter will depend on the real number α ∈(0, 1] charac-
terising the weakly singular factor pα(t −s) of the kernel Hα(t, s): our aim is
to choose r(α) so that the collocation solutions uh and uit
h , or their discretised
counterparts, exhibit optimal orders of global and local (super-) convergence.
In order to obtain some ﬁrst insight into why mesh grading is crucial when
approximating functions with low regularity we recall a number of relevant
deﬁnitions and results from classical aproximation theory.
Deﬁnition A function f : I := [0, T ] →IRis said to be H¨older continuous on
I, with H¨older exponent β ∈(0, 1], if there exists a constant Lβ > 0 so that the
H¨older condition,
| f (t) −f (τ)| ≤Lβ|t −τ|β
for all t, τ ∈I,
holds. The space of H¨older continuous functions on I will be denoted by Cβ(I).
If a function f : I →IRis in Ck(I) and y(k) ∈Cβ(I), then we shall write
f ∈Ck,β(I), withC0,β(I) := Cβ(I). For β = 1 we obtain the space of Lipschitz
continuous functions on I which we will denote by C0,1(I). Clearly, C0,1(I) is
a proper subset of C(I).
Illustration 6.2.1 It is easily veriﬁed that for ρ ∈IN0 the function f (t) := tρ+β
is in Cρ,β[0, T ] for any T > 0.
How well can a function f ∈Cβ(I) (0 < β < 1) be approximated by (con-
tinuous) piecewise polynomials? The key to the answer in the case of polyno-
mial approximation is given by the classical results of Jackson (see, e.g. Timan
(1963) or Schumaker (1981)), and they can be used to obtain corresponding
optimal orders of convergence for piecewise polynomials of (ﬁxed) degree. We
ﬁrst cite the following simple but instructive result (which, together with their
proofs, can be found in the books by de Boor (2000) and Powell (1981, pp.
254–255)).
Theorem 6.2.4 Let f (t) = tβ (0 < β < 1), t ∈[0, 1], and assume that ph is
the unique interpolant in S(0)
1 (Ih) for f with respect to the points Ih := {tn :
0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tN = 1}.

372
6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
(i) If Ih is the uniform mesh then
|| f −ph||∞≤C1(β)N −β.
This estimate is also true if Ih is a quasi-uniform mesh.
(ii) If Ih is the graded mesh given by
tn :=
 n
N
r
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N),
with r = r(β) = 2
β ,
then
|| f −ph||∞≤C∗
1(β)N −2.
Proof It is not difﬁcult to show that the interpolation error on the subinterval
¯σn := [tn, tn+1] is given by
eh(t) := f (t) −ph(t) = tβ −[(tn+1 −t)tβ
n + (t −tn)tβ
n+1]/hn,
with hn := tn+1 −tn. The maximum of |eh(t)| on ¯σn is attained at the point
ξn := [βhn/(tβ
n+1 −tβ
n )]1/(1−β.
It now follows from the geometry of f that for uniform Ih we have ||eh||∞=
|eh(ξ0)|, and a simple calculation then yields the result of (i).
The assertion of (ii) is proved analogously, by using the given specially
graded mesh and the above expression for ξn.
In order to acquire more insight into the nature of this problem, and as a step
towards the general best approximation result of Theorem 6.2.7 below, we will
indicate how the results of Theorem 6.2.4 can be derived in a different way, by
using what is called an equidistribution principle for the points of the mesh Ih.
The proof can be found in, e.g. de Boor (2000).
Theorem 6.2.5 Assume that f ∈C2(0, 1) has the property that it is monotone
near t = 0+ and t = 1−, with
 1
0 | f ′′(t)|1/2dt < ∞. If ph ∈S(0)
1 (Ih) is the in-
terpolant for f on Ih and if the points of Ih satisfy the equidistribution condition
 tn
0
| f ′′(t)|1/2dt = n
N
 1
0
| f ′′(t)|1/2dt
(n = 1, . . . , N −1),
then the order of the interpolation error eh := f −ph is optimal:
||eh||∞≤C∗
1 N −2.
As we will see in Illustration 6.2.2 below, for f (t) = tβ (0 < β < 1) the
corresponding optimally graded mesh of Theorem 6.2.4(ii) can also be obtained
by the above equidistribution equation.

6.2 Collocation for weakly singular VIEs of the second kind
373
So far we have only looked at interpolation for H¨older continuous functions.
What can be said about the optimal approximation order exhibited by the best
uniform approximation p∗
h ∈S(0)
m (Ih)? It turns out, not surprisingly if we look
at the Jackson theorems, that the optimal order on uniform Ih is again O(N −β),
regardless of the degree m ≥1. The optimal order is recovered by a judicious
grading of the mesh Ih, as the following theorem reveals.
Theorem 6.2.6 Assume:
(a) f ∈Cm+1(0, 1), with
 1
0
| f (m+1)(t)|1/(m+1)dt < ∞.
(b) The points deﬁning the mesh Ih satisfy the equidistribution equations

N
 1
0
| f (m+1)(t)|1/(m+1)dt,

If p∗
h ∈S(0)
m (Ih) denotes the best uniform approximation to f on I, that is, if
|| f −p∗
h||∞≤|| f −ph||∞
for all
ph ∈S(0)
m (Ih),
then
|| f −p∗
h||∞≤C∗N −(m+1).
The proof of this theorem can be found in Schumaker (1981, pp. 286–294);
see also de Boor (2000).
Illustration 6.2.2 Let f (t) = tβ (0 < β < 1) and I = [0, 1]. It follows from
f (m+1)(t) = const · tβ−m−1 that
| f (m+1)(t)|1/(m+1) = const · tβ/(m+1)−1.
Hence, the equidistribution condition reduces to
 tn
0
tβ/(m+1)−1dt = n
N
 1
0
tβ/(m+1)−1dt
(n = 1, . . . , N −1),
and this yields the mesh described by
tn =
 n
N
(m+1)/β
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N).
We shall encounter this optimal grading exponent, r = r(β) := (m + 1)/β, in
the subsequent convergence analyses for VIEs and VIDEs with weakly singular
kernels.
Illustration 6.2.3 Consider f (t) = t log(t) in I = [0, 1]. Since we now have
f (k+1)(t) = (−1)k+1(k −1)!t−k (k ≥1, t > 0),

374
6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
and hence
| f (m+1)(t)|1/(m+1) = const · t−m/(m+1),
the equdistribution condition yields the optimal grading exponent r = m + 1,
and the corresponding graded mesh is given by
tn =
 n
N
m+1
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N).
We observe that this agrees formally with r(1) in Illustration 6.2.2. See also the
result of Theorem 6.2.11.
Readers who are looking for a more general setting and additional details
on the results in this section are directed to the papers by Krantz (1983) and
Graham (1985).

6.2 Collocation for weakly singular VIEs of the second kind

The ﬁrst result (see de Hoog and Weiss (1973c)) deals with the optimal
order of the product quadrature error on uniform meshes when pα(t −s) =
(t −s)−α (0 < α < 1).

(c) Ih is uniform: tn := nh, n = 0, 1, . . . , N (Nh = T ).
Then for any α ∈(0, 1) and any d ≥m,
|(Q(α) f )(tn) −( ˆQ(α) f )(tn)| ≤C(α)
 hm
if κ = 0
hm+1−α
if κ > 0.
For suitably graded meshes it is possible to attain a higher order of conver-
gence (Schneider (1980); compare also Kaneko and Xu (1994), K¨ohler (1995),
and Tamme (2000)):
Theorem 6.2.8 Let κ be as in Theorem 6.2.7 and assume that:
(a) f ∈Cm+κ(I) if κ > 0; else f ∈Cm+1(I);
(b) Ih is the graded mesh given by
tn :=
 n
N
ρ∗
,
with ρ∗= ρ∗(α) := m + κ + 1
m + 1 −α .
Then for any α ∈(0, 1) we have
|(Q(α) f )(tn) −( ˆQ(α) f )(tn)| = O(n−(m+κ)) (n = 1, . . . , N).
This estimate remains true for graded meshes with grading exponents ρ > ρ∗
and sufﬁciently small mesh diameters h.
The principal application of these results in the subsequent analysis will
be in the convergence analysis of the discretised collocation solution (Section
6.2.7). As a preview we note here that the optimal grading exponent ρ∗given
in (b) of the above theorem satisﬁes
ρ∗= m + κ −α
m + 1 −α <
m
1 −α =: r
for all α ∈(0, 1]: since r will be seen to be the optimal grading exponent for
the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to attain the global order p = m on I,
Theorem 6.2.8 will show that the discretised collocation solution will retain
this order, due to sufﬁcient (over-) grading of the mesh.

376
6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
An analogous result is true for the logarithmic kernel singularity p1(t −s) =
log(t −s) (corresponding to α = 1). This can be proved by using, for example,
Theorem 2.3 in Kaneko and Xu (1994), with r = m in the above inequality.
6.2.5 Global convergence results
The collocation error eh := y −uh associated with the collocation solution
uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to the (linear) VIE
y(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
satisﬁes
eh(t) = (Vαeh)(t),
t ∈Xh.
(6.2.32)
Assume ﬁrst that 0 < α < 1 (the case of the logarithmic kernel singularity will
be considered later). We know from Section 2.2.4 and the regularity property
of the exact solution y that much of the global convergence analysis carries
over to VIEs with weakly singular kernels. The signiﬁcant new element is the
representation of eh on the ﬁrst subinterval ¯σ0 := [0, h0]: since y possesses an
unbounded derivative at the left endpoint t = 0+, we have to replace the local
representation (2.2.31) (which was based on the Peano Theorem) by
eh(t0 + vh0) =
m

j=1
L j(v)E0, j + hβ
0 Rm,0(v; α),
v ∈[0, 1],
(6.2.33)
with appropriate (fractional) exponent β > 0 and remainder term Rm,0(v; α) to
be determined. On the other subintervals σn (n = 1, . . . , N −1) the represen-
tation (2.2.31),
eh(tn + vhn) =
m

j=1
L j(v)En, j + hm
n Rm,n(v),
v ∈(0, 1],
(6.2.34)
remains valid. Hence, a look at the proof of Theorem 2.2.3 (recall in particular
(2.2.33) and the subsequent discrete Gronwall argument for (2.2.34)) reveals
that the order of the collocation error will be governed by the ﬁrst remainder
term hβ
0 Rm,0(v; α). The detailed proof of the following theorem will show that
for uniform meshes the value of β will be β = 1 −α, regardless of the degree
m −1 of the piecewise polynomials in uh. This is of course not unexpected
after our short excursion, in Section 6.2.3, into the problem of approximating
non-smooth functions. That insight also suggests that if Ih is a graded mesh with
grading exponent r = r(α) ≥m/(1 −α) then uh converges again with optimal
order p = m.

6.2 Collocation for weakly singular VIEs of the second kind
377
Graded meshes in collocation (and Galerkin) methods for Fredholm integral
equations of the second kind were ﬁrst employed in the late 1970s, by Chandler
(1979), Graham (1980), Schneider (1981), and Vainikko and Uba (1981) (com-
pare also the Notes in Section 6.7). For VIEs with 0 < α < 1 they were used
by Brunner (1985a, 1985c) (see also the Brunner and van der Houwen (1986,
Chapter 6) and the survey by Brunner (1987)). The deﬁnitive convergence (and
superconvergence) analysis, including weakly singular kernels of logarithmic
type, as well as bounded but non-smooth kernels, can be found in Brunner,
Pedas and Vainikko (1999).
The basic result is the following.
Theorem 6.2.9 Assume:
(a) The given functions in the Volterra integral equation (6.2.4) satisfy K ∈
Cm(D) and g ∈Cm(I).
(b) The kernel singularity in Vα is pα(t −s) = (t −s)−α, with 0 < α < 1.
(c) uh ∈S(−1)
m
(Ih) is the (unique) collocation solution to (6.2.4) deﬁned by
(6.2.5), with h ∈(0, ¯h) and corresponding to the collocation points Xh.
(d) The grading exponent r = r(α) ≥1 determining the mesh Ih is given by
r(α) =
µ
1 −α ,
µ ≥1 −α.
Then we have, setting h := T/N:
||y −uh||∞:= sup
t∈I
|y(t) −uh(t)| ≤C(r)
 hµ
if 1 −α ≤µ ≤m,
hm
if µ ≥m,
(6.2.35)
holds for any set Xh of collocation points with 0 ≤c1 < · · · < cm ≤1. The
constant C(r) depends on the {ci} and on the grading exponent r = r(α), but
not on h.
Proof As we have indicated at the beginning of this section, the proof will fol-
low closely the one for Theorem 2.2.1, except that now the local (Peano) repre-
sentation of the exact solution y on ¯σn remains valid only if n = 1, . . . , N −1.
The collocation error eh := y −uh satisﬁes the error equation
eh(tn,i) = (Vαeh)(tn,i),
i = 1, . . . , m
(0 ≤n ≤N −1).

and with obvious adaptation of the meaning of the deﬁnition of Ym,0(v; α);
recall (6.1.17). (The general initial point t0, instead of t0 = 0, is being used in
view of later applications to weakly singular VIE with non-vanishing delays;
see Sections 6.5 and 7.5.)

Recall now the deﬁnition of the matrices B(ℓ)
n (α) and the vectors ρ(ℓ)
n (α) (ℓ<
n) from Section 6.2.1. It is easy to verify, along the lines of the proof of Theorem
2.2.3, that
||B(ℓ)
n (α)||1 ≤D1(α)(n −ℓ)−α
(ℓ< n)
and
||ρ(ℓ)
n (α)||1 ≤R1(α)(n −ℓ)−α
(ℓ< n),
with appropriate constants D1(α) and R1(α) depending on m and the bounds
for K and the uniform norms of the Lagrange fundamental polynomials L j.
The inequality (6.2.45) now becomes

Recall now the generalised discrete Gronwall inequality (6.1.45) and Theo-
rem 6.1.19: we now have zℓ:= ||Eℓ||1, and the sequence {γn} given by

where the last expression represents the lower Riemann sum (left rectangular
quadrature approximation) for the given integral whose integrand is convex on

Hence, we have found a uniform upper bound for γn, namely,
γn ≤¯γ := γ1(α)h1−α

+ γ2(α)hm+1−α + γ3(α)hmT 1−α/(1 −α)
= γ1(α)h1−α

and with this (6.2.46) leads to

Lemma 6.2.3 shows that

n = 1, . . . , N,
and we have

= (T N −r)1−α = T 1−αN −r(1−α) = T 1−αN −µ,
(6.2.47)
for any graded Ih with grading exponent r = µ/(1 −α) (1 −α ≤µ ≤m).
Therefore, ||En||1 ≤Bhµ (1 ≤n ≤N −1), and so, by (6.2.37) and (6.2.41),
we arrive at the desired estimate for ||eh||∞.
If the weakly singular part of the kernel Hα(t, s) in (6.2.2) is of logarithmic
type (corresponding to α = 1) we recover the optimal (global) order of conver-
gence if r = m, as the following theorem (due to Brunner, Pedas and Vainikko
(1999)) shows.
Theorem 6.2.11 Assume that in (6.2.2), (6.2.4) we have α = 1 (that is,
pα(t −s) = log(t −s)) and g ∈Cm(I), K ∈Cm(D). Let Ih be the graded
mesh (6.2.31) with grading exponent r ≥1, and set h := T/N. Then the global
order of convergence of the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for (6.2.4) is
described by
||y −uh||∞≤C(r)



h(1 + | log(h)|)
if r = 1 and m = 1,
h
if r > 1 and m = 1,
hr
if 1 ≤r ≤m
and m ≥2,
hm
if r ≥m and m ≥2.
Proof The proof is based on the regularity result of Theorem 6.1.7 (recall
also Illustration 6.2.3). Details may be found in the paper just mentioned: they
include the embedding of the given VIE (6.2.4) into a second-kind Fredholm
integral equation and the corresponding tools for the analysis of its collocation
solution.

6.2 Collocation for weakly singular VIEs of the second kind
385
We conclude this section by complementing the above convergence results
with one for VIEs whose kernels are bounded but have unbounded derivatives.
As a typical example, consider
(Vν y)(t) :=
 t
0
(t −s)ν K(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(6.2.48)
with ν := ρ −α (ρ ∈IN and 0 < α < 1). Assume also that K(t, t) ̸= 0 for
t ∈I. (VIEs with more general non-smooth (but bounded) kernels have been
studied in Brunner, Pedas and Vainikko (1999).)
Theorem 6.2.12 Assume that the given functions g and K in
y(t) = g(t) + (Vν y)(t),
t ∈I,
satisfy g ∈Cm(I), K ∈Cm(D). If Ih is the graded mesh (6.2.31) with grading
exponent
r = r(ν) =
µ
1 + ν
(µ ≥1 + ν),
then the corresponding collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) satisﬁes
||y −uh||∞≤C(r)
 hµ
if 1 + ν ≤µ ≤m,
hm
if µ ≥m,
where we have again deﬁned h := T/N. These estimates hold for any {ci} with
0 ≤c1 < · · · < cm ≤1.
The proof is left as an exercise: its starting point is the regularity result of
Theorem 6.1.8, and it consists essentially in a straightforward adaption of the
proof for Theorem 6.2.9 where 1 −α is now replaced by 1 + ν = ρ + 1 −α.
The choice of the grading exponent then implies
h1+ν
0
= (T N −r)1+ν = T 1+ν N −µ.
Compare also Brunner (1985b), and see Brunner, Pedas and Vainikko (1999)
for the extension of Theorem 6.2.12 to bounded but non-smooth kernels of the
form (t −s)k log(t −s) (k ∈IN).
6.2.6 Global and local superconvergence results
So far we have only considered the attainable order of (global) convergence
on I for the collocation solution uh when {ci} is an arbitrary set of collocation
parameters. If uit
h is the corresponding iterated collocation solution,
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Vαuh)(t),
t ∈I,

386
6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
can it exhibit global or local superconvergence (on I or Ih \ {0}, respectively),
and what are the optimal orders? It is intuitively clear that on uniform meshes
little can be gained. As the following theorems show, the possible orders of
superconvergence for suitably graded meshes are only marginally higher than
m.
Theorem 6.2.13 Assume:
(a) g ∈Cm+1(I), K ∈Cm+1(D), with K(t, t) ̸= 0 on I, and 0 < α < 1;
(b) uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) is the collocation solution to (6.2.4), with corresponding
iterated collocation solution uit

(c) the collocation parameters satisfy J0 :=

Then:

Proof The relationship between eit
h := y −uit
h and the defect δh, deﬁned by

where Rα(t, s) is the resolvent kernel introduced in Theorem 6.1.2,
Rα(t, s) := (t −s)−αQ(t, s; α) (0 < α < 1).
We ﬁrst observe that
δh(t) = eh(t) −(Vαeh)(t),
t ∈I,
implies, by the global convergence result of Theorem 6.2.9,
||δh||∞≤(1 + ||Vα||∞)||eh||∞≤(1 + ||Vα||∞)C(r)hµ =: D(r)hµ,
provided the grading exponent has been chosen as r = µ/(1 −α) with 1 −α ≤

6.2.7 Fully discretised collocation and product integration
methods
We have shown in Section 2.2.6 that a judicious choice of the quadrature for-
mulas in the discretisation of the integrals occurring in the collocation equation
will not reduce the order of convergence of the resulting discretised collocation
solution ˆuh. This remains true for VIEs with weakly singular kernels when
appropriate product quadrature formulas are used. To be more precise, assume
that uh and ˆuh denote again the exact and the discretised collocation solution
in S(−1)
m−1(Ih): they are determined, respectively, by the equations
uh(t) = g(t) + (Vαuh)(t),
t ∈Xh
and
ˆuh(t) = g(t) + ( ˆVα,h ˆuh)(t),
t ∈Xh.
The discretised Volterra operator ˆVα,h was introduced in Section 6.2.2: it is
given by
( ˆVα,h ˆuh)(tn,i) := ˆFn(tn,i; α) + h1−α
n
( ˆQn(α)ˆuh)(tn,i),
where
ˆFn(tn,i; α) :=

ℓ=0
( ˆQ(ℓ)
n (α)ˆuh)(tn,i)
and with product quadrature operators ˆQn(α) and ˆQ(ℓ)
n (α) deﬁned in (6.2.20)
and (6.2.21). The discretised iterated collocation solution ˆuit
h associated with
ˆuh is deﬁned by
ˆuit
h (t) := g(t) + ( ˆVα,h ˆuh)(t),
t ∈I.
What can be said about the orders of the perturbations
zh(t) := uh(t) −ˆuh(t),
and
zit
h (t) := uit
h (t) −ˆuit
h (t),
t ∈I ?
In order to show that its order agrees with that of the exact collocation solution
itself, we introduce the product quadrature errors,
( ˆQ(ℓ)
n (α)ˆuh)(tn,i) = (Q(ℓ)
n (α)ˆuh)(tn,i) −E(ℓ)
n (tn,i; α) (ℓ< n),
( ˆQn(α)ˆuh)(tn,i) = (Qn(α)ˆuh)(tn,i) −En(tn,i; α),

zh(tn,i) = (Vαuh)(tn,i) −( ˆVα,h ˆuh)(tn,i),
it follows that Zn := (Zn,1, . . . , Zn,m)T solves the algebraic system

erned by the results of Theorem 6.2.7 (if Ih is uniform) and Theorem 6.2.8 (if Ih
is graded); see also Brunner (1984b) and Brunner and van der Houwen (1986,
pp. 365–369). We summarise these order results in
Theorem 6.2.14 Assume:
(a) g ∈Cd(I), K ∈Cd(D) for some d ≥m, and 0 < α < 1;
(b) uh ∈S(−1)

(1982a), and in the book by Vainikko, Pedas and Uba (1984). More recent
papers are by Kaneko, Noren and Xu (1992) and by Pedas and Vainikko (1997)
(nonlinear FIEs). The standard reference for regularity results of solutions of
multidimensional FIEs with weakly singular kernels is Vainikko (1993).
It is clear from our earlier analysis that this singular behaviour of the solution
at t = 0 and t = T will in general again result in a reduction of the attainable
orderofpiecewisepolynomialcollocationsolutions.Assumethatuh ∈S(−1)

with corresponding iterated collocation solution given by

h (t) := g(t) + λ(Fαuh)(t),
t ∈I.
The set Xh of collocation points is again based on m distinct collocation pa-
rameters {ci} in I. In order to reﬂect the symmetric location of the points where
y has unbounded derivatives we choose the points of the mesh Ih by

Vainikko and Pedas (1981), Schneider (1981), Pedas and Vainikko (1997); also
Kaneko, Noren and Xu (1992) and Kaneko, Noren and Padilla (1997)) that, for
sufﬁciently regular g and K and 0 < α < 1,
||y −uh||∞:= sup{|y(t) −uh(t)| : t ∈I} = O(N −µ)
if the grading exponent is given by r = µ/(1 −α) (1 −α ≤µ ≤m), in com-
plete analogy to the result in Theorem 6.2.9 for weakly singular VIEs. The
iterated collocation solution exhibits (slight) global superconvergence on I,
namely
||y −uit
h ||∞= O(N −(m+1−α),
provided the collocation parameters satisfy the orthogonality condition J0 = 0
(cf. Theorem 6.2.13).
Similar optimal estimates hold when α = 1 (pα(t) = log(t)); see Pedas and
Vainikko (1997) for details.
6.2.9 Hammerstein-type VIEs: Implicitly linear collocation
Most nonlinear VIEs with weakly singular kernels arising in the mathemati-
cal modelling of physical or biological phenomena are of Hammerstein type

(ii) If Ih is graded, with grading exponent r satisfying r ≥(m + κ + 1)/
(m + 1 −α), then we obtain (setting h := T/N)
||uh −ˆuh||∞≤C(r)hm+κ
and ||uit
h −ˆuit
h ||∞≤C(r)hm+κ,
for all α ∈(0, 1).
Remark The use of non-product (but interpolatory) quadrature formulas for
the integrals Q(ℓ)
n (α)uh (ℓ< n) whose abscissas are the collocation points in
the subintervals σℓlead to the same estimates, but possibly with larger error
constants.
Proof In Theorem 6.2.7 (product quadrature on uniform Ih) and Theorem 6.2.8
(product quadrature on graded meshes) we presented the relevant information
on the orders of the resulting product quadrature errors. Note that the smooth
part of the integrand in Section 6.2.4 is now given by the product of the kernel
K and the restriction of the collocation solution uh (or ˆuh) on the subintervals
¯σn. Moreover, as we observed after Theorem 6.2.8,
r = m/(1 −α) > (m + κ + 1)/(m + 1 −α)
for α ∈(0, 1) and all m ≥1.
6.2.8 Comparison with weakly singular Fredholm
integral equations
Solutions of second-kind Fredholm integral equations with weakly singular
kernels but otherwise smooth data g and K (with K(t, t) ̸= 0),
y(t) = g(t) + λ(Fαy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
where the Fredholm operator Fα : C(I) →C(I) has the form
(Fαφ)(t) :=
 T
0
pα(|t −s|)K(t, s)φ(s)ds,
0 < α ≤1,
and pα(t) as before, possess unbounded derivatives at both endpoints of I. To be
more precise, assume that λ−1 ̸∈σ(Fα) and that g ∈Cm(I), K ∈Cm(I × I).
The unique solution y then lies in Cm(0, T ), and the behaviour at t = 0+ and
t = T −is described by
|yν)(t)| ≤C[t1−α−ν + (T −t)1−α−ν],
t ∈(0, T ),
(ν = 1, . . . , m).
Details and proofs of this and more general regularity results for weakly singular

mavally (1958), Levin (1960), Olmstead and Handelsman (1976), Groetsch
(1989, 1991), and their references). A typical example arises in nonlinear heat

(t −s)−α[ f (s) −(y(s))k]ds
(α = 1/2,
k > 1)
(Roberts and Mann (1951); see also Gorenﬂo and Kilbas (1995)). Therefore
we will not extend the previous convergence analyses to completely general
nonlinear VIEs but restrict our considerations to problems of the form
y(t) = g(t) + (Hαy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(6.2.52)
with
(Hαy)(t) :=
 t
0
Hα(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds.
Here, Hα(t, s) := pα(t −s)K(t, s), with smooth K and G and with K(t, t) ̸=
0 on I. The VHIE (6.2.53) can again be rewritten in a form that leads to a
computationally more attractive version of the collocation method. Setting
z(t) := (N y)(t) := G(t, y(t)),
t ∈I,
(6.2.53)
where N denotes the Niemytzki operator, equation (6.2.52) becomes an im-
plicitly linear integral equation for z, namely,
z(t) = (N(g + Vαz))(t) = G(t, g(t) + (Vαz)(t)),
t ∈I,
(6.2.54)
with linear Volterra operator
(Vαz)(t) :=
 t
0
pα(t −s)K(t, s)z(s)ds.
The solution y is then found by the iteration
y(t) = g(t) + (Vαz)(t),
t ∈I.
(6.2.55)
Hence, as in Section 2.33, we approximate z by the collocation solution zh ∈
S(−1)
m−1(Ih),
zh(t) = G(t, g(t) + (Vαzh)(t)),
t ∈Xh,
(6.2.56)
and deﬁne the approximation yh to the solution y of the original VHIE (6.2.50)
by
yh(t) := g(t) + (Vαzh)(t),
t ∈I.

(6.2.60)
As we have already observed in Section 2.3.3 (see the remark preceding
Theorem 2.3.4), the principal merit of implicitly linear collocation is that it
eliminates the necessity of re-computing the integrals in the (nonlinear) collo-
cation equation: since the integrals in (6.2.59) do not depend on the unknown
Zn := (Zn,1, . . . , Zn,m)T , they need to be evaluated only once, before the begin-
ning of the iteration process chosen for the solution of the nonlinear algebraic
system (6.2.59).
Itturnsoutthattheapproximation yh obtainedbyimplicitlylinearcollocation
and the iterated collocation solution uit
h generated by ‘direct’ collocation are
essentially identical when K(t, s) ≡1. Thus, for judiciously chosen collocation
parameters {ci} both approaches yield superconvergent approximations of the
same global and local order, in particular on optimally graded meshes (cf.
Theorem 6.2.13). This is made precise in
Theorem 6.2.15 Assume:
(a) g ∈C(I), K(t, s) ≡1, and G is smooth and such that the Volterra–
Hammerstein equation (6.2.52) has a unique solution y ∈C(I) for given
α ∈(0, 1].

0 < α ≤1, obtained by implicitly linear collocation (6.2.56), (6.2.57).

direct collocation solution ˆuh ∈S(−1)

collocation equation (6.2.61), (6.2.62) below, using the same collocation
points Xh as for the computation of zh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) in (6.2.56).
Then for any α ∈(0, 1] we have
ˆuit
h (t) = yh(t) for all
t ∈I.
Proof If we solve the given Volterra–Hammerstein integral equation (6.2.52)
by ‘direct’ collocation in S(−1)
m−1(Ih), the the exact collocation equation reads
uh(t) = g(t) + (Hαuh)(t),
t ∈I,
and the corresponding exact iterated collocation solution is found from
uit
h (t) := g(t) + (Hαuh)(t),
t ∈I.
Recall that by our assumption on K we now have Hα(t, s) = pα(t −s). For
t = tn,i (i = 1, . . . , m) and t = tn + vhn (v ∈[0, 1]) these equations become,

where the stage values Zn,i are deﬁned by the solution of the nonlinear al-
gebraic system (6.2.59). This is readily veriﬁed by induction, using the obvious
fact that the assertion is true for n = 0. We summarise the convergence result
in Theorem 6.2.16 and leave the remaining details of its proof as an exercise.
Theorem 6.2.16 Assume that the given functions describing the VHIE (6.2.52)
satisfy g ∈Cm(I), K(t, s) ≡1, with G ∈Cm(I × ) ( ⊂IR) such that the
integralpossessesauniquesolution y ∈Cm(I).If(6.2.52)issolvedbyimplicitly

It is clear that the superconvergence results of Theorem 6.2.13 carry over to

these by now expected results.

donotconvergetotheexactsolutionforanychoiceofthecollocationparameters
{ci}. Hence, it is intuitively clear that the same will be true when the Volterra
integral operator contains the weakly singular factor pα(t −s) (0 < α ≤1).
It turns out, however, that to describe this quantitatively poses a formidable
challenge, and so far only a few partial results are known.
We will focus on the case where uh ∈S(−1)
nm−1(Ih); in view of the results of
Theorem 2.4.5 (Kauthen and Brunner (1997)) the convergence analysis in the
continuous collocation space S(0)
m (Ih) will be even more intractable at present.

(6.3.6)
Under the assumptions of Theorem 6.1.13 the matrix Bn(α) is non-singular
for all sufﬁciently small values of hn. To see this, recall that the assumption
K ∈C1(D) allows us to write, by Taylor’s Theorem,
K(tn,i, tn + shn) = K(tn, tn) + hn[ci Kt(tn + θ1cihn, tn + θ2shn)
+ sKs(tn + θ1cihn, tn + θ2shn)],
where θk ∈(0, 1) (k = 1, 2). Hence, the element of the matrix Bn(α) corre-
sponding to the index pair (i, j) can be expressed in the form
 ci
0
pα((ci −s)hn)[K(tn, tn) + O(hn)]L j(s)ds
(i, j = 1, . . . , m),
and this reveals that for sufﬁciently small hn > 0,
Bn(α) =

is invertible for n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1 and all α ∈(0, 1], under the assumption
that |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0, t ∈I.
Theorem 6.3.1 Assume that g and K in the ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equation
(6.3.1) satisfy
g ∈C1(I), g(0) = 0;
K ∈C1(D), |K(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0, t ∈I.
Then for any α ∈(0, 1] there exists an ¯h = ¯h(α) > 0 so that for all meshes Ih
with diameter h ∈(0, ¯h) each of the linear algebraic systems (6.3.4) possesses
a unique solution Un ∈IRm. Hence, for such meshes the collocation equation
(6.3.2) deﬁnes a unique collocation solution uh ∈S(0)

by (6.3.3).

Since uh is constant on each σn we again set yn+1 := uh(tn + vhn (v ∈(0, 1]).

uniformly on I only if
θ ≥θ∗(α) := 1
2(α(1 −α)γα)1/(1−α) (0 < α < 1).
On uniform meshes the order then cannot exceed p = α, while on suitably
graded meshes (with grading exponent r ≥m/α) we observe O(h)- conver-
gence (having set h := T/N).

6.3 Collocation for weakly singular ﬁrst-kind VIEs
399
As we shall see in Conjecture 6.3.5 at the end of Section 6.3.3, no necessary
and sufﬁcient condition on the two collocation parameters is known yet under
which uh converges uniformly on I to y.
6.3.2 Collocation in S(0)
m (Ih)
We have seen in Section 2.4.3 that the imposition of continuity at the mesh
points on the collocation solution uh for a ﬁrst-kind VIE leads to a more severe
constraint on the collocation parameters {ci} for which uh is convergent, even
in the case of smooth exact solutions. Since in a weakly singular ﬁrst-kind VIE
(6.3.1) with smooth g (satisfying g(0) = 0) and K the exact solution has an un-
bounded derivative at t = 0+ (Theorem 6.1.14), such a continuity requirement
will likely make the conditions on the {ci} more stringent (and will certainly
lead to very challenging arguments in the convergence analysis!). At the time
of writing this problem remains essentially open (except for some special re-
sults in the case m = 1 and c1 = 1; see, e.g. Weiss (1972b), Benson (1973),
Eggermont (1981), and Capobianco (1990a, 1990b)).
The collocation equation determining uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is
(Vαuh)(t) = g(t),
t ∈Xh,
with uh(0) = y(0),
(6.3.7)
where
y(0) = lim
t→0+
(1 −α)tα−1g(t)

must be known. As in Section 2.4.3, let the local representation of uh on σn be

L j(v) := (v/c j)

k=0,k̸= j

we are led to a linear algebraic system for Un := (Un,1, . . . , Un,m)T which
resembles (6.3.4) but which contains on its right-hand side an additional term
reﬂecting the continuity of uh at the mesh points:
Bn(α)Un = h−1
n [gn −Gn(α)] + ρn(α)yn
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1).
(6.3.11)
The matrix Bn(α) and the vectors gn and Gn(α) are as in (6.3.4)–(6.3.6).
Note that the existence of a unique collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is
assured by Theorem 6.3.1 because in the systems of linear algebraic equations
(6.3.11) we have the same coefﬁcient matrices Bn(α) as in (6.3.4).
Example 6.3.3 uh ∈S(0)

6.3.3 Convergence analysis; conjectures
For the weakly singular ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equation (6.3.1) with
0 < α < 1, no necessary and sufﬁcient conditions under which the colloca-
tion solutions in the spaces S(d)
m+d(Ih) (d = −1, 0) are convergent are yet known
(compare, however, Eggermont (1984, 1988b) for an analysis of related ques-
tions in Galerkin methods for (6.3.1) and for a comparison of Galerkin and
collocation methods).
Before describing a partial answer for the collocation space S(−1)
0
(Ih) of
piecewise constant functions we ﬁrst show that we can answer the question on
the global order of convergence of uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), provided we know that the
collocation parameters {ci} are such that ||y −uh||∞→0, as h →0, is true.
Theorem 6.3.2 Let 0 < α < 1 and assume that K and g in (6.3.1) are, re-
spectively, in Cm+1(D) and Cm+1(I), with K(t, t) ̸= 0 for all t ∈I. In addition
suppose that
g( j)(0) = 0,
j = 0, 1, . . . , q,
(6.3.12)
for some q with 0 ≤q < m. If the collocation parameters {ci : 0 < c1 < · · · <
cm ≤1} are such that the corresponding collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to
(6.3.1) converges uniformly to y on I then we have, for all h ∈(0, ¯h),
∥y −uh∥∞≤Chα+q
(6.3.13)
for any α ∈(0, 1), regardless of the choice of m, if the mesh Ih is uniform.
For graded meshes given by
tn =
 n
N
r
T
(n = 0, 1, . . . , N),
with r =

(6.3.14)
we obtain the estimates

 hµ
if α + q ≤µ ≤m,
hm
if µ ≥m,
(6.3.15)
with h := T/N.

Proof We will sketch the main steps but leave the details to the reader. First,
we recall that the collocation error, eh := y −uh, satisﬁes
(Vαeh)(t) = 0
for t ∈Xh.
Since 0 < α < 1, this equation can be written more explicitly as

(i = 1, . . . , m; n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1). While uh |(tn,tn+1] is a polynomial of de-
gree m −1, the exact solution y of (6.3.1) has, according to Theorem 6.1.14,
lower regularity at t = 0, namely y ∈Cq,α(I). Thus, the collocation error may
be expressed in the form
eh(tn + vhn) =

n Rm,n(v),
if 1 ≤n ≤N −1,
(6.3.17)
in analogy to (6.2.39) and (6.2.37). Here, ρ0(·; α), Rm,0(·; α), and Rm,n are
bounded functions analogous to those in Theorems 6.1.6 and 6.1.14 (compare
also the results in Section 6.5.2) below).
If the above expressions (6.3.17) for eh are substituted in the error equation
(with t = tn,i) we obtain, as in the proof of Theorem 6.2.9 but with α + q
replacing 1 −α, ﬁrst an estimate of the form ||β0(α)||1 ≤Bhα+q
0
and so
|eh(t0 + vh0)| = O(hα+q
0
),
v ∈[0, 1].
The subsequent systems of difference equations (for 1 ≤n ≤N −1) are
uniquely solvable for h ∈(0, ¯h), thanks to the crucial assumption on the col-
location parameters {ci} (which is equivalent to the statement that the matrices
Bn(α) all possess uniformly bounded inverses for α ∈(0, 1)). A discrete Gron-
wall argument leads to uniform O(hα+q
0
)-bounds for the quantities ||En||1 and
hence, by the local representation (6.3.17) for eh, for ||eh||∞itself.
Note that for the graded meshes Ih with grading exponent r = µ/(α + q)
we obtain
h0 = t1 = (N −1)rT = N −µ/(α+q)T,
and hence hα+q
0
= O(N −µ) = O(hµ) (α + q ≤µ ≤m) similar to (6.2.47).

6.3 Collocation for weakly singular ﬁrst-kind VIEs
403
The order result of Theorem 6.3.2 hinges on the assumed uniform conver-
gence of the collocation solution uh. We will now investigate this assumption
for the simple collocation space S(−1)
0
(Ih) and derive a sufﬁcient condition for
c1 ∈(0, 1] under which uh is convergent. Some related convergence results
were obtained in the early 1970s: In Weiss and Anderssen (1972) it was shown
that uniform convergence holds for the (discretised) collocation solution uh
when c1 = 1. It is thus natural to ask if this is true for all c1 ≥1/2, as in the
nonsingular case α = 0. The following theorem answers this question in the
afﬁrmative. The result shows in particular that the collocation equation corre-
sponding to m = 1 has uniformly bounded solutions as h →0 even for certain
values of c1 < 1/2, depending on the given value of α. This is not entirely
surprising because the ﬁrst-kind VIE (6.3.1) becomes ‘less ill-conditioned’ as
α moves from 0+ to 1−.
Theorem 6.3.3 Let K and g in (6.3.1) satisfy the conditions stated in The-
orem 6.3.2 (with m = 1), and let uh ∈S(−1)
0
(Ih) be the collocation solution
corresponding to the collocation parameter c1 ∈(0, 1] and uniform mesh Ih. If
c1 ≥c∗
1(α) := 1
2 (α(1 −α)γα)1/(1−α) ,
(6.3.18)
where γα := π/ sin(απ) (= (α)(1 −α)), then uh converges uniformly on I
to the solution y of (6.3.1).
We present a sample of values for c∗
1(α) in the following table, as an illus-
tration of (6.3.18).
While numerical experiments indicate that the lower bound (6.3.18) for
c1 appears to be also necessary for uh to remain uniformly bounded for all
α ∈(0, 1), a result analogous to that for α = 0 (cf. Theorem 2.4.2), giving a
necessary and sufﬁcient condition, is yet to be established.
Proof We will outline a few of the key steps in the proof of the above result;
details are left to the reader. The setting is as follows. We have seen in Section
6.1.3 (Theorem 6.1.13) that, for 0 < α < 1, (6.3.1) is equivalent to the regular

(Ih), with
collocation at tn + c1h, 0 < c1 ≤1, and the solution of the (equivalent) ﬁrst-
kind Volterra integral equation (6.3.19) is approximated by zh in the same space,
but with collocation at the points tn + d1h, for some d1 ∈(0, 1]. Since H(·, ·; α)
and Gα in (6.3.19) satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 2.4.2, we know that zh
converges uniformly on I to y if, and only if, d1 ≥1/2.
The collocation equation determining uh is given in Example 6.3.1. For ease
of exposition we will assume that K(t, s) ≡1, implying that H(t, s; α) = γα
on D; suppose also that q = 0. Thus, setting uh(tn + vhn) =: yn+1 (v ∈(0, 1]),

Lemma 6.3.4 We have uh(t1) = zh(t1) for any g ∈C1(I) with g(0) = 0 if, and
only if, ξ1 = c1 and
c1 = φ(α) · d1,
where φ(α) := (α(1 −α)γα)1/(1−α) and γα := π/ sin(απ).
Note that the function φ is strictly decreasing on (0, 1), with φ(0) = 1 and
φ(1−) = e−1.
For n ≥1, |zn+1| (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1) is uniformly bounded as h →0
and Nh = T if, and only if, d1 ≥1/2 (Theorem 2.4.2)). In order to complete
the proof of Theorem 6.3.3 we now have to show that, using (6.3.20) and
(6.3.22), |zn+1 −yn+1| (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1) remains uniformly bounded as
N →∞, tN = T , whenever c1 ∈(0, 1] is chosen so that
c1 ≥φ(α)/2 = c∗

The details are left to the reader.
As we observed at the beginning of the present section, an analogue of
Theorem 6.3.3 for collocation in S(−1)
m−1(Ih) with m ≥2 is not yet known. There
appears to be a close connection between the answer to this open problem and
the asymptotic behaviour of the collocation solution vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), with the

y(t) = 1 +
 t
0
λ(t −s)−αy(s)ds,
0 < α < 1,
λ < 0.
(6.3.23)
We will say that the solution y of (6.3.23) is Aα-stable if, for tn := nh (n =
0, 1, ...), with ﬁxed h > 0,
lim
n→∞uh(tn) = 0,
for all λ < 0.
Conjecture 6.3.5 Assume that the collocation parameters {ci} satisfy 0 <
c1 < · · · < cm ≤1 and let the mesh Ih be uniform. The collocation solution
uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for the weakly singular ﬁrst-kind VIE (6.3.1) with 0 < α < 1
converges uniformly to the exact solution y as h →0 if, and only if, the collo-
cation solution vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), using the same set {ci}, for the weakly singular
second-kind equation (6.3.23) is Aα-stable.
However, it is at present not known for which {ci} the collocation solution
vh for (6.3.23) has the property of being Aα-stable. A partial answer (sufﬁcient
condition) was given in Brunner, Crisci, Russo and Vecchio (1991) for the case
m = 1.
The ﬁnal remark in this section concerns collocation for the singularly per-
turbed VIE
εy(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I,
0 < α < 1,
with 0 < ε ≪1. We have seen that for ε = 1 the collocation uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih)
exhibits optimal order of convergence p = m if the mesh Ih is graded and
r =: r1 = m/(1 −α). If ε = 0 and the collocation parameters {ci} are such
that the collocation solution in this space converges uniformly to y, then it
attains the same optimal order p only if the grading exponent is r =: r0 = m/α.
While we have r1 = r0 when α = 1/2, numerical experiments show clearly that
for α ̸= 1/2 the collocation solution corresponding to mesh grading with r1
loses its optimal order as ε →0+. Thus, it will be important to understand the
dependence of the order, and hence that of the optimal grading exponent, on ε,
as ε →0.
An excellent survey of singularly perturbed Volterra equations and the state
of the art in their numerical analysis can be found in Kauthen (1997a).
6.3.4 Fully discretised collocation
The secondary discretisation step in the (exact) collocation equation (6.3.2)
will, as in the case of second-kind VIEs with weakly singular kernels, be based

on interpolatory m-point quadrature formulas whose abscissas are given by
the collocation parameters. Since the generalities have been dicsussed in detail
in Section 6.2.2, we will not repeat them here. Instead we present the fully
discretised collocation equations for two important special cases: these product
integration methods were analysed in the early papers Weiss and Anderssen
(1972), Weiss (1972b), Benson (1973), and Eggermont (1981).

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
is given in Brunner (1983). In the practically important case where α = 1/2
the number of basis functions used to represent zh on σ0 is 2m. If α →1−, the
number of basis functions tends to inﬁnity. This observation is closely connected
with a result of Lubich (1983a) which shows that the number of order conditions
required for a Volterra–Runge–Kutta method for a weakly singular VIE to have
order m tends to inﬁnity as α →1−.
Variants of such non-polynomial collocation methods were studied by a
number of authors. The paper by te Riele (1982) discusses hybrid methods (for
α = 1/2) that combine the above non-polynomial spline collocation technique
(on a feasible small number of subintervals σ0, . . . , σn0) with subsequent piece-
wise polynomial collocation. The underlying mesh is uniform. See also Cao,
Herdman and Xu (2003).
Another approach was investigated by Hu (1997a): here, the collocation
solution is a so-called piecewise β-polynomial (employing integer powers of
tβ, with suitable β, as basis functions), and Ih is a specially chosen geometric
mesh. Compare also Hu (1998c) for postprocessing techniques based on this
special non-polynomial spline approximation, and Hu and Luo (1997) for its
use in Volterra–Hammerstein equations with weakly singular kernels.
6.5 Weakly singular Volterra functional equations with
non-vanishing delays
6.5.1 Collocation for delay equations of the second kind
In Section 6.1.6 we introduced the delay Volterra operators Vθ,α and Wθ,α:
recall that they are respectively deﬁned by
(Vθ,αy)(t) :=
 θ(t)
0
pα(t −s)K2(t, s)y(s)ds,
t ∈I := [t0, T ] (t0 ≥0),
and
(Wθ,αy)(t) :=
 t
θ(t)
pα(t −s)K(t, s)ds,
t ∈I.
The lag function θ is assumed to be subject to the conditions (D1)–(D3) of
Section 6.1.7, and the kernels K2 and K are smooth on their domains Dθ and
¯Dθ. Suppose we approximate the solutions of the corresponding VIEs
y(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t) + (Vθ,αy)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],
and
y(t) = g(t) + (Wθ,αy)(t),
t ∈(t0, T ],

6.4 Non-polynomial spline collocation methods
409
The discretised product trapezoidal method was studied by Weiss (1972a,
1972b); see also Benson (1973) and, especially, Eggermont (1981).
Remark Convergence results for the product midpoint and product trape-
zoidal methods were proved in Weiss and Anderssen (1972) and Weiss (1972b)
(and by Eggermont (1981)) under the assumption that the underlying exact
solution of (6.3.1) has Lipschitz-continuous derivatives, namely y ∈C1,1(I)
and y ∈C2,1(I), respectively. The resulting orders of convergence on uniform
meshes are then given by O(h) and O(h2). As we have seen in Theorem 6.1.14,
this regularity is present only under special assumptions on g( j)(0) ( j ≥1). In
general, smooth K and g lead to y ∈C0,α(I) only. Hence, in order to attain
O(h)- and O(h2)-convergence the mesh Ih must be graded, with grading ex-
ponents r = m/α (m = 1, m = 2), as shown in Theorem 6.3.2. On uniform
meshes we have only O(hα)-convergence, both for m = 1 and m = 2.
6.4 Non-polynomial spline collocation methods
6.4.1 Weakly singular VIEs of the second kind
In Section 6.2.5 (proof of Theorem 6.2.9) we observed that the reason behind
the low (O(h1−α)-) convergence of the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for
uniform meshes lies in the fact that on the ﬁrst subinterval σ0 the polynomial
uh ∈πm−1 cannot match the fractional-power terms of the exact solution y (cf.
Theorem 6.1.6). This suggests that, on uniform Ih, it may be more natural to seek
thecollocationsolutioninspecialnon-polynomialsplinespaceswhoseelements
reﬂect the expansion (6.1.38) of y. In other words, if we choose a collocation
space Z(−1)
m−1(Ih) with the property that zh ∈Z(−1)
m−1(Ih) on ¯σ0 = [t0, t1] (t0 = 0)
reduces to
zh(t0 + vh) =

( j,k)1−α
b j,kv j+k(1−α),
v ∈[0, 1],
(6.4.1)
where ( j, k)1−α := {( j, k) : j + k(1 −α) < m, j, k ∈IN0} and b j,k = b j,k(h),
then this local representation exactly matches the terms in the ﬁrst expression
on the right-hand side of (6.1.38). The error analysis for the corresponding
collocation solution zh can then be carried out along familiar lines (using a
standard Gronwall argument, as in the proof of Theorem 6.2.9) and it reveals
that ∥y −zh∥∞= O(hm) (see also Brunner and van der Houwen (1986, Section
6.2.5)).

with y(t) := φ(t) if t ≤0, by the collocation solutions uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) and the
associated iterated collocation solutions uit
h . What is the combined effect of the
non-vanishing delay and the weakly singular kernel on the order of (super-)
convergence of the collocation and iterated collocation solutions? Since opti-
mal convergence orders are attained only if the mesh Ih is suitable graded (cf.
Theorems 6.2.9 and 6.2.13), the answer to this question depends on the regu-
larity of the solutions y at the primary discontinuity points {ξµ} (Table 6.1) and
– as we shall see – on whether the lag function θ is linear or nonlinear. The
following lemma provides the key to these results.
Lemma 6.5.1 Assume that the mesh Ih := ∪M
µ=0I (µ)
h
is θ-invariant (Deﬁnition
4.2.1), and let the ﬁrst local mesh I (0)
h
be optimally graded:
t(0)
n
:= ξ0 +
 n
N
r0 (ξ1 −ξ0) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N; ξ0 = t0), with r0 =
m
1 −α .
(i) If the lag function θ is linear, then the other local meshes I (µ)
h
are also
optimally graded, with grading exponents rµ = r0 (µ = 1, . . . , M).
(ii) If θ is nonlinear, then the grading is lost for I (µ)
h
(µ = 1, . . . , M).
Proof The assertion in (i) is a direct consequence of the deﬁnitions of θ-
invariance and the primary discontinuity points {ξµ}, and the linearity of θ(t) =
t −τ(t). These reveal that the grading exponent r0 remains invariant under θ.
The validity of (ii) can be seen graphically, by constructing an example.
Table 6.1 shows that, depending on the type of the delay VIE, the solution at ξ +
µ
is in Cµ,1−α (smoothing), or in C1−α for all µ = 0, 1, . . . , M (no smoothing).
Hence, Lemma 6.5.1 tells us that for linear lag functions the proofs of Theorems
6.2.9 and 6.2.13 carry over to second-kind VIEs with non-vanishing delays and
weakly singular kernels, leading to the ﬁrst assertion in the following theorem.
Theorem 6.5.2 Assume:
(a) The given functions g, b, K1, K2, θ, φ are d ≥m-times continuously
differentiable on their respective domains, with the lag function θ satisfying
the conditions (D1)–(D3) and α ∈(0, 1).
(b) uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), with θ-invariant mesh Ih.
(c) The ﬁrst local mesh I (0)
h
is optimally graded:
t(0)
n
:= t0 +
 n
N
r0 (ξ0 −t0) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N),
with r0 =
m
1 −α .

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
(I) If θ is linear, the results of Theorems 6.2.9 and 6.2.13 remain valid on each
subinterval I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1]:
∥y −uh∥µ,∞:= sup
t∈I (µ) |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤C(α)N −m
(0 ≤µ ≤M),
and, for d = m + 1 and {ci} with J0 = 0,
∥y −uit
h ∥µ,∞≤C(α)N −(m+1−α)
(0 ≤µ ≤M).
(II) If θ is nonlinear, the results of Theorems 6.2.9 and 6.2.13 are in general
valid only on I (0). On the subsequent subintervals I (µ) (µ ≥1) the attainable
orders of ∥y −uh∥µ,∞and ∥y −uit
h ∥µ,∞will be less than m and lie between
1 −α and m, except when m = 1 and we have smoothing in the exact solution.
Remarks
1. For linear lag functions the (super-) convergence results of Brunner, Pedas
and Vainikko (1999), in particular those involving logarithmic kernel sin-
gularities, remain true for second-kind delay VIEs with weakly singular, or
bounded but non-smooth, kernels.
2. If θ is nonlinear, we can of course still obtain global convergence order
p = m, by resorting to local meshes I (µ)
h
that are individually graded:
r If the solution y has Cµ,1−α-regularity at t = ξ +
µ (cf. Table 6.1) then –
according to Theorem 6.2.9 – the optimal grading exponent for I (µ)
h
is
rµ =



m
µ + 1 −α
for µ = 0, 1, . . . , min{m, M},
1
for µ = m + 1, . . . , M.
r If y has only C1−α-regularity at each ξµ (no smoothing), then we choose
rµ = m/(1 −α for all µ = 0, 1, . . . , M.
The corresponding global mesh Ih is of course no longer θ-invariant.
6.5.2 Collocation for weakly singular delay VIEs of the
ﬁrst kind
Since we do not yet understand for which sets of collocation parameters {ci}
collocation solutions to ﬁrst-kind VIEs with weakly singular kernels converge
uniformly on I, the reader will not be surprised to read that the convergence
analysis of collocation solutions uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) for the functional equation
(Wθ,αy)(t) = g(t),
t ∈(t0, T ] (g(0) = 0),

is a completely open problem. The same is true for a closely related Volterra
functional integro-differential equation, namely
d
dt [(Wθ,αy)(t)] = f (t),
(6.5.2)
even when θ(t) = t −τ (τ > 0) (compare also the comments at the end of the
paper by Ito and Turi (1991)). A new semigroup framework (different from the
one in the paper just mentioned) for (6.5.2) has recently been established in
Cl´ement, Desch and Homan (2003): since, as shown in Ito and Turi (1991), the
delay equation (6.5.1) can be recast in the form (6.5.2), this framework may
yield the basis for the analysis of collocation solutions to (6.5.1).

Exercise 6.6.20 (Research problem)
Extend the sequential collocation method/sequential future (constant/poly-
nomial) regularisation methods of Lamm and Scoﬁeld (2000) and of Ring

Exercise 6.6.21 The result in Theorem 6.1.6 on the representation of the solu-
tion to the second-kind VIE y(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t) (0 < α < 1) can be used,
as already suggested in Section 6.4.1, as the basis for obtaining non-polynomial
collocation solutions to this equation. Using the appropriate collocation space
(which, on the ﬁrst subinterval ¯σ0, is spanned by the functions
φ(0)
j,k(t) := t j+k(1−α),
j + k(1 −α) < m
( j, k ∈IN0 )),
analyse the attainable orders of convergence of the corresponding collocation
solution and its iterate. In particular, is superconvergence (globally, on I, and
locally, on Ih) possible? (Compare also Brunner (1982b, 1983) and Brunner
and van der Houwen (1986, Section 6.2.5).)
Exercise 6.6.22 Show that the starting methods used by Lubich for the frac-
tional linear multistep methods for solving weakly singular VIEs of the second
kind can be interpreted as non-polynomial spline collocation methods using
equidistant collocation points (see also Exercise 6.6.23 below).
Exercise 6.6.23 (Research problem)
Give a convergence analysis of non-polynomial spline collocation for linear
ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equations with weakly singular kernel pα(t −s)

condition for the collocation parameters which implies the uniform convergence
of the collocation on I (assume that the mesh is uniform).

Exercise 6.6.24 (Research problem)
Solutions of certain nonlinear VIEs with weakly singular kernels can blow
up for some ﬁnite value of t (recall also Section 2.1.5). Typical examples are
encountered in the modelling of the formation of shear bands in steel, when
subjected to very high strain rates (see Roberts, Lasseigne and Olmstead (1993)
and the survey paper by Roberts (1998)). If y = y(t) denotes the temperature
at time t, a simple such model is given by
y(t) = γ
 t
0
(t −s)−α(1 + s)q[y(s) + 1]pds,
t ≥0,
where γ > 0, 0 < α < 1, q ≥0, p > 1. The numerical analysis (e.g. of col-
location methods) for such problems is not yet understood. Thus, as a ﬁrst step,
consider the collocation solution uh ∈S(−1)
0
(Ih), with c1 = 1/2 and c1 = 1, and
the associated iterated collocation solution. The choice of the mesh Ih is ini-
tially governed by the non-smooth behaviour of y near t = 0 (graded mesh with
r = 1/(1 −α)). As we approach the blow-up point t = Tb (and uh becomes
large), the stepsize sequence {hn} must be such that the nonlinear algebraic
equations remain uniquely solvable.
(a) Discuss the choice of Ih near t = T −
b . (Compare also Bandle and Brunner
(1994).)
(b) (Detection of blow-up.) Is it possible to generate collocation solutions
uh, vh (corresponding to two different values of c1) so that, for a given
mesh Ih,
vit
h (t) ≤y(t) ≤uit
h (t) for all t ∈[0, Tb) ?
Exercise 6.6.25 Let 0 < α < 1 and assume that the lag function θ is nonlinear
and satisﬁes (D1)–(D3). Let Ih be a θ-invariant whose ﬁrst submesh I (0)
h
is
graded with grading exponent r0 = m/(1 −α). Are the submeshes I (µ)
h
(µ =

Exercise 6.6.26 Suppose that a weakly singular delay VIE with α ∈(0, 1)
and non-vanishing linear delay satisfying (D1)–(D3) is solved by collocation
in S(−1)
m−1(Ih). If the submeshes I (µ)
h
(µ = 0, 1, . . . , M) are graded individually,
each with optimal grading exponent rµ (recall Remark 2 following Theorem
6.5.2), is local superconvergence of order m + 1 −α possible on Ih \ {t0}?

6.7 Notes
6.1: Review of basic Volterra theory (III)
The two papers by Evans (1910, 1911) are based on his doctoral dissertation
(written under the supervision of Bˆocher); they represent the ﬁrst detailed stud-
ies of second-kind VIEs with weakly singular kernels, as well as other types of
singular VIEs.
The Swedish mathematician Mittag-Lefﬂer introduced ‘his’ function in se-
ries of papers in the early 1900s; the one of 1903, listed in the References, is a
good one to consult. It was used by Hille and Tamarkin (1930) to represent the
solution of certain linear VIEs with weakly singular kernels. The survey paper
by Mainardi and Gorenﬂo (2000) is a rich source of information on the history,
theory, and applications of the Mittag-Lefﬂer function; it also contains an exten-
sive list of references. In addition see Erd´elyi (1955), Wagner (1978) (Laplace
transform techniques and asymptotic behaviour of solutions), Gorenﬂo (1987,
1996), W. Han (1994), and Kiryakova (2000).
Regularity results for weakly singular second-kind VIEs can be found for
example in Evans (1910), Tychonoff (1938), Miller and Feldstein (1971), Lu-
bich (1983a), Brunner (1983, 1985b, 1985c), Brunner and van der Houwen
(1986, Ch. 6), Mydlarczyk (1990) and – especially – in Brunner, Pedas and
Vainikko (1999). Compare also volume 2 of Feny¨o and Stolle (1984). At the
end of Section 6.1.5 we pointed out an example of a non-compact Volterra
integral operator. The paper by Graham and Sloan (1979) establishes necessary
and sufﬁcient conditions for compactness of (Fredholm) integral operators, and
introduces tests for deciding if these conditions are satisﬁed. Many of these
results will of course be relevant for Volterra integral operators.
Blow-up for nonlinear weakly singular VIEs (possessing Hammerstein non-
linearities G(s, y) with G(s, 0) = 0, implying the existence of nontrivial solu-
tions, in addition to y = 0) is studied in Mydlarczyk (1994, 1996, 1999, 2003),
Bushell and Okrasi´nski (1996), and Mydlarczyk and Okrasi´nski (2001, 2003).
See also Constantin and Peszat (2000) on the generalisation of some results in
Bushell and Okrasi´nski (1996).

6.7 Notes
419
Another important class of VIEs with ﬁnite-time blow-up is mentioned in
the next paragraph on applications. The numerical analysis (e.g. of collocation
methods) for blow-up problems in VIEs is not yet understood.
Existence results for nonlinear VIEs of the form (y(t))β = g(t) +
(Vy)(t) (β > 1), can be found in Bushell and Okrasi´nski (1992) and in Buckwar
(1997, 2000). See also Kilbas and Saigo (1999).
Applications of VIEs with weakly singular kernels
Of the many papers listed (and annotated) in the bibliography we just mention
a brief selection:
r Heat transfer problems: This is one of the major sources of (nonlinear) VIEs
with weakly singular kernels. Beginning with the papers by Mann and Wolf
(1951) and Roberts and Mann (1951), we have later contributions by Keller
and Olmstead (1972), Olmstead and Handelsman (1976), Gorenﬂo (1987),
Norbury and Stuart (1987), Groetsch (1989, 1991), Jumarhon (1994), Ju-
marhon and McKee (1996), Jumarhon et al. (1996), and Ibrahim and Alnasr
(1997).
An interesting VIE, due to Lighthill, is studied in Franco, McKee and Dixon
(1983): its kernel is of form (t p −s p)−α, with p = 3/2 and α = 2/3.
r Gas absorption: Olmstead (1977).
r VIEs with blow-up solutions: Solutions of certain nonlinear VIEs with weakly
singular kernels can blow up for ﬁnite value of t (recall also Section 2.1.5).
Typical examples are encountered in the modelling of the formation of shear
bands in steel, when subjected to very high strain rates (see Roberts, Lasseigne
and Olmstead (1993)). Related papers are by Olmstead and Roberts (1994,
1996), Olmstead, Roberts and Deng (1995), Roberts and Olmstead (1996),
Olmstead (1997, 2000), Roberts (1997, 2000) and her survey paper of 1998.
Compare also Exercise 6.6.23.
r Weakly singular VIEs of the ﬁrst kind, either in Abel’s original form, or with
singularity (t p −s p)−α (p > 1), arise in many applications. The survey paper
by Anderssen (1977) and the monograph by Gorenﬂo and Vessella (1991) list
numerous sources and contain extensive bibliographies. See also Atkinson
(1974a, 1974b), Brunner (1975), and Hung (1979). A related ﬁrst-kind VIE
(the generalised Tricomi equation, related to a boundary-value problem in
PDEs) is studied in v. Wolfersdorf (1965); its numerical analysis is to my
knowledge completely open.
The reader should also consult the illuminating paper by Plato (1997a) in
which a general resolvent theory for Abel-type integral operators of the above
form is established; it also deals with Lavrentiev’s iterated regularisation
method.

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
r Systems of VIEs with non-smooth solutions arise for example in the spatial
discretisation of partial VIEs of the form
u(t, x) = φ(x) +
tα/2
(1 + α/2)ψ(x) +
1
(α)
 t
0
(t −s)α−1u(s, x)ds,
with 1 ≤α ≤2. Such PVIEs are studied in the two papers by Fujita (1990).
6.2: Collocation for weakly singular VIEs of the second kind
Many different aspects of the classical H¨older spaces (including approxima-
tion theory) can be found in Timan (1963), Kufner, John and Faˇc´ık (1977),
Burchard (1977), Powell (1981), and Zeidler (1990). See also Rice (1969)
(where a somewhat different terminology is employed), and the survey paper
by Brunner (1987, p. 585).
Of the many papers dealing with product quadrature for weakly singular inte-
grands we cite the theses by Benson (1973), Logan (1976) and Kutsche (1994),
andthepapersbydeHoogandWeiss(1973c,1974),Schneider(1980),Palamara
Orsi (1993), Kaneko and Xu (1994), Mastroianni and Monegato (1994), K¨ohler
(1995), Monegato and Lyness (1998) and Tamme (2000). See also Schwab
(1994) for an analysis of composite quadrature formulas of variable order, and
Monegato and Sloan (1997) on quadrature approximations for Cauchy-type
singular integrals.
Discretised collocation methods based on product integration (for weakly
singular VIEs of the ﬁrst and second kind) was suggested by Huber (1939);
he used the space S(0)
1 (Ih). His analysis was extended by Wagner (1954) (see
also Mirkin and Nilov (1991) where non-uniform meshes were employed). The
application of product integration to integral equations is the subject of Young
(1954).
Of the subsequent papers we mention Oul`es (1964), Linz (1969c), the doc-
toral theses of Benson (1973) and Logan (1976), de Hoog and Weiss (1974),
Bownds (1979), Bownds and Wood (1976), Cameron and McKee (1984).
Lubich (1983a) provided a comprehensive analysis (order conditions and
their dependence on α ∈(0, 1)) of Runge–Kutta methods for weakly singular
VIEs.
Various aspects of piecewise collocation methods were analysed by Brunner
and Nørsett (1981) (superconvergence), Kershaw (1982a, 1982b) (asymptotic
stability in S(0)
1 (Ih)), Brunner (1985a, 1985c) (graded meshes), Brunner and van
der Houwen (1986, Chapter 6) (see also the survey paper of Brunner (1987),
Eggermont (1988a) (trapezoidal method on IR+), Palamara Orsi (1996), Mon-
egato and Scuderi (1998a,b), Kasemets and Pedas (1999) (discretisation of
collocation equation by product quadrature), Tamme (1999), and Savchenko

(2003). Optimal superconvergence order estimates, also for L p-norms and log-
arithmic kernel singularities, can be found in Brunner, Pedas and Vainikko
(1999); this paper contains an extensive list of references.
Collocation methods for VIEs with other types of singular kernels are dis-
cussed in Diogo (1991), Diogo, McKee and Tang (1991, 1994), and Lima and
Diogo (1997).
A numerical approach to weakly singular VIEs of the third kind (whose
left-hand side is p(t)y(t), with p(t) = 0 at a ﬁnite number of points in I) can
be found in Pereverzev and Pr¨ossdorf (1997).
In order to avoid the use of graded meshes, it may be feasible to use a suitable
transformation of the independent variable to obtain a VIE whose solution is
smooth and which can be solved on a uniform mesh (with respect to the new
variable). Such an approach were already described by Prasad (1924). See also

A good (early) survey paper is by Elliott (1982); compare also Volume 4 of

Galerkin and collocation methods. The most comprehensive exposition of the

6.3: Collocation for weakly singular ﬁrst-kind VIEs
Huber (1939) studied collocation in S(0)
1 (Ih) for weakly singular VIEs. The con-
vergence properties of the product midpoint and trapezoidal methods were anal-
ysed in detail in Weiss (1972a, 1972b), Weiss and Anderssen (1972), Benson
(1973) and – especially – in Eggermont (1981). See also Cameron and McKee

6 VIEs with weakly singular kernels
(1984). Branca (1976, 1978) used a more general approach which is more in
the spirit of collocation methods; it leads to higher-order spline methods. The
paper by te Riele and Schroevers (1986) contains an illuminating numerical
comparison of the performance of many discretisation methods, including col-
location.
The papers by Brunner (1997b, 1999a, 1999c) convey a picture of the ‘state
of the art’ in the analysis of collocation methods for such VIEs, including the
open problems mentioned earlier in this chapter. In addition, see Eggermont
(1984, 1988b) (also for a comparison of collocation and Galerkin methods),
Capobianco (1988, 1990), and Capobianco and Formica (1998).
Numerical methods for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with kernel singularities (t p −
s p)−α p > 1, 0 < α < 1) can be found in, e.g. Atkinson (1974b), Brunner
(1975), Anderssen (1976) (use of inversion formula and spectral differentia-
tion), Anderssen (1977) (survey paper; see also the proceedings volume edited
byAnderssen,deHoogandLukas(1980)),SmarzewskiandMalinowski(1978),
Hung (1979), and Smarzewski and Malinowski (1983) (singular kernels of the
form (h(t) −h(s))−α).
The convergence analysis for collocation solutions in S(d)
m+d(Ih) (d ∈
{−1, 0}) remains to be established: as in the case p = 1 it is not known (except
for m = 1 and c1 = 1) under which conditions on the collocation parameters
{ci} one obtains uniform convergence on I as h →0 (to my knowledge, there
is not even a counterpart to Theorem 6.3.3 when m = 1).
Boundary integral equations
Collocation methods for BIEs have received considerable attention in the last
dozen years or so. The surveys by Atkinson (1997b) and by Sloan (2000)
convey a detailed picture of these developments. In addition, see also, e.g.
Chandler (1984) (mesh grading), Elschner (1989), Chandler and Sloan (1990),
Iso and Onishi (1991), Lubich and Schneider (1992) (time-discretisation), Sloan
(1992, 1995), Hamina and Saranen (1994), McLean (1994) (comparison of
exact and discretised collocation solutions), Sloan (1995), Berthold and Sil-
bermann (1995), Elschner and Graham (1995), Saranen and Vainikko (1996)
(trigonometric collocation), Tran and Sloan (1998), H¨am¨al¨ainen (1998), Sloan
and Tran (1998, 2001), Junghanns and Rathsfeld (2002), as well as the mono-
graphs by Saranen and Vainikko (2002) (and its bibliograpy) and Yu (2002).
Qualocation
The ‘quadrature modiﬁed collocation method’ (or qualocation method) com-
bines the best properties of Galerkin methods (superconvergence, easy stability
analysis) and collocation methods (no inner products, cheaper implementa-
tion); this is achieved by replacing the inner products by speciallly designed

quadrature rules not based on the collocation parameters. Its principal applica-
tion is in boundary integral equations. An excellent survey is Sloan (2000)
(with numerous references); in addition, see Sloan (1998b, 1991), Hagen
and Silbermann (1988), Wendland (1989), Yan (1990), Chandler and Sloan
(1990), Tran and Sloan (1998), Sloan and Tran (2001), and the book by Hagen,
Roch and Silbermann (1995). An alternative but related approach for periodic
pseudo-differential equation, using ‘corrected’ collocation methods, described
in Berthold and Silbermann (1995).
6.4: Non-polynomial spline collocation methods
Collocation methods in non-polynomial spline spaces (and on uniform meshes)
reﬂecting the non-smooth behaviour of solutions of weakly singular VIEs were
introduced in te Riele (1982) (for α = 1/2) and Brunner (1983); see Brun-
ner (1982b) and Brunner and van der Houwen (1986, Chapter 6). Hu (1997a,
1997) and Hu and Luo (1997) combined special non-polynomial splines (‘β-
polynomials’), geometric meshes, and interpolation postprocessing to obtain
superconvergence results for such VIEs. An analogous approach to weakly sin-
gular VIDEs can be found in Hu (1996a, 1998b). Cao, Herdman and Xu (2003)
describe a hybrid collocation method, combining non-polynomial spline col-
location near the singular point t = 0 with polynomial spline collocation on
suitably graded meshes in the rest of I. Riley (1989, 1992) applied Sinc meth-
ods to linear, weakly singular VIEs. Stenger (1993, 1995, 2000) should be
consulted for a comprehensive treatment and applications of these functions. A
different kind of non-polynomial spline approximation can be found in Horvath
and Rogina (2002) (for singularly perturbed VIEs and VIDEs).
The reader may also wish to look at the survey paper by Unser and Blu
(2000) on fractional splines and wavelets.
6.5: Weakly singular Volterra functional equations with non-vanishing delays
Numerical methods for the ﬁrst-kind Volterra functional integro-differential
equation (6.5.2) can be found in Herdman and Turi (1991a) and in Ito and
Turi (1991). They use the semigroup framework of Burns, Herdman and Stech
(1983) to rewrite the given equation as a hyperbolic PDE with non-local bound-
ary conditions. As we mentioned before, the numerical exploitation of the alter-
native semi-group framework for (6.5.2) given in Cl´ement, Desch and Homan
(2002) remains to be studied. Collocation for the integrated form of this class
of equations is discussed in Brunner (1999c).

VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
The order reduction we observed in Chapter 6 when approximating solutions of
weakly singular Volterra integral equations by piecewise polynomial colloca-
tion on uniform meshes is also present in analogous Volterra integro-differential
equations, although their solutions are slightly more regular. We shall see that
the principal ideas underlying the convergence analysis in the previous chap-
ter are readily adapted to derive analogous optimal convergence estimates for
VIDEs with weakly singular kernels.
7.1 Review of basic Volterra theory (IV)
7.1.1 Linear weakly singular VIDEs
In this section we will focus on the regularity properties of solutions to initial-
value problems for linear ﬁrst-order VIDEs with weakly singular kernels,
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
y(0) = y0.

if
0 < α < 1,
log(t −s)
if
α = 1,
and with K ∈C(D), K(t, t) ̸= 0 for t ∈I. We will again set Hα(t, s) :=
pα(t −s)K(t, s). Various nonlinear and higher-order (neutral) counterparts of
(7.1.1) will be considered in Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3.

The regularity analysis can be based on either of two second-kind VIEs that
are equivalenti to the original initial-value problem (7.1.1). Its ﬁrst reformula-

if 0 < α < 1,
(t −s)[log(t −s) −1]
if α = 1.
Before stating the fundamental result on existence and representation of
solutions we look at a representative example, as we did in Section 6.1.1. It is
the VIDE
y′(t) = g(t) + λ

(7.1.10)
Its uniqueness, and the uniqueness of y, follow from that of the resolvent kernel

ular, we have ∂rα(t, s)/∂s = −RI
α(t, s) ∈C(D), and rα(t, t) = 1 for all t ∈I.
Since (7.1.1) and (7.1.3) are equivalent, this completes the ﬁrst part of the proof.
The above also reveals that the resolvent rα(t, s) associated with the linear

The resolvent kernel rα(t, s) can also be deﬁned by the (unique) solution of
an adjoint resolvent equation, in complete analogy to the result in Chapter 3
(Theorem 3.1.2). We summarise this for the sake of completeness in Theorem
7.1.2 and leave the details of its proof as an exercise.
Theorem 7.1.2 Assume that a ∈C(I) and K ∈C(D), and let α ∈(0, 1]. Then
the resolvent kernel rα = rα(t, s) of the linear weakly singular VIDE (7.1.1) is
also the (unique) solution of the adjoint resolvent equation,

7 VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
Corollary 7.1.3 The resolvent equations associated with the special weakly
singular VIDE
y′(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I,
(7.1.13)
with Vα as in (7.1.2), are

Hα(t, v)rα(v, s)dv,
(t, s) ∈D,
with rα(t, t) = 1 (t ∈I) and rα(s, s) = 1 (s ∈I), respectively.
We now return to (7.1.1) and show that solutions corresponding to smooth
data will in general not be smooth at t = 0+: they lie in the H¨older space
C1,1−α(I).
Theorem 7.1.4 Assume that a, g ∈Cm(I) and K ∈Cm(D) (m ≥1), with
K(t, t) ̸= 0 on I, and let α ∈(0, 1). Then:
(i) The regularity of the solution y of the linear VIDE (7.1.1) with weak kernel
singularity pα(t −s) is described by
y ∈C1(I) ∩Cm+1((0, T ]),
with y′′ being unbounded at t = 0+:
|y′′(t)| ≤Ct−α
for t ∈(0, T ].
(ii) The solution y can be written in the form
y(t) =

( j,k)ν
γ j,k(ν)t j+k(1+ν) + Ym+1(t; ν),
t ∈I,
(7.1.14)
where ν = 1 −α and, slightly abusing the notation in Theorem 6.1.6,
( j, k)ν := {( j, k) : j, k ∈IN0, j + k(1 + ν) < m + 1}.
Moreover, Ym+1(·; ν) ∈Cm+1(I), and the coefﬁcients γk, j(ν) are deﬁned in
analogy to the γ j,k(α) in the proof of Theorem 6.1.6.
Proof We have seen that for 0 < α < 1, the weakly singular VIDE (7.1.1) is
equivalent to the second-kind VIE (7.1.3) whose kernel is bounded and whose
convolution part is essentially (t −s)1−α. The regularity of solutions to VIEs
of this type has been analysed in Theorem 6.1.8: the present case corresponds

426
7 VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
A more explicit expression can be obtained by carrying out the differentiation
and then applying integration by parts. For g(t) ≡0 this yields
y(t) = E2−α(λ0(2 −α)t2−α)y0,
t ∈I.
The deﬁnition of the Mittag-Lefﬂer function tells us that the solution y of (7.1.5)
is in C1(I); however, its second derivative typically behaves like |y′′(t)| ≤Ct−α
near t = 0+. As Theorem 7.1.4 will show, this reﬂects the general situation:
solutions to (7.1.1) with smooth data a, g and K and 0 < α < 1 exhibit the
regularity behaviour just described; that is, the solution of (7.1.1) is in the H¨older
space C1,1−α(I).
We ﬁrst give the representation of the solution of the initial-value problem
(7.1.1), thus extending Theorem 3.1.1 to linear VIDEs with weakly singular
kernels.
Theorem 7.1.1 Assume that a, g ∈C(I) and K ∈C(D), and let α ∈(0, 1].
Then for any initial value y0 the VIDE (7.1.1) possesses a unique solution
y ∈C1(I) satisfying y(0) = y0. Moreover, there exists a unique function rα =
rα(t, s) satisfying rα ∈C1(D), so that this solution has the representation
y(t) = rα(t, 0)y0 +
 t
0
rα(t, s)g(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(7.1.6)
The resolvent kernel rα can be deﬁned as the solution of the resolvent equation

= −rα(t, s)a(s) −
 t
s
rα(t, v)Hα(v, s)dv,
(t, s) ∈D,
(7.1.7)
with rα(t, t) = 1 for t ∈I.
Proof We will use the second-kind VIE (7.1.3) to establish results on the
properties of solutions of the weakly singular VIDE (7.1.1). Let RI
α(t, s) denote
the resolvent kernel of the kernel K I
α(t, s) in the integral equation (7.1.3). Since
K I
α ∈C(D) we can use the results of Section 2.1.1: RI
α solves the resolvent
equation (2.1.10),

to ρ = 1 in ν = ρ −α. Thus, the result of Theorem 7.1.4 follows immediately
from that theorem.
Regularity results for linear VIDEs with logarithmic kernel singularity or
with non-smooth but bounded kernels can be found in the papers by Brunner,
Pedas and Vainikko (2001a, 2001b). Exercise 7.7.6 also deals with some of
those cases.
7.1.2 Nonlinear VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
The nonlinear VIDE with weakly singular kernel,
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)) +
 t
0
hα(t, s, y(s))ds,
(7.1.15)
where hα(t, s, y) := pα(t −s)k(t, s, y) and 0 < α ≤1, with smooth f (t, y)
and k(t, s, y), is equivalent to a nonlinear VIE with bounded kernel,

f (s, y(s)) +

ds.
If (7.1.15) is of Hammerstein type, that is, if k(t, s, y) = K(t, s)G(s, y), then
the equivalent VIE is
y(t) = y(0) +
 t
0
( f (s, y(s)) + Hα(t, s)G(s, y(s)))ds,
with
Hα(t, s) :=
 t
s
pα(v −s)K(v, s)dv,
(t, s) ∈D.
Therefore, the existence and uniqueness of its solution follow from Theorem
2.1.10: if the nonlinearities f (t, y) and G(s, y) are (Lipschitz) continuous on
I × 	 for some 	 ⊂IR, then there is a unique local solution on some interval
[0, δ0).
The semilinear VIDE

VIDEs: the linear Volterra integral operator Vα has been perturbed by the Ham-
merstein term

7 VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
corresponding to Hα(t, s) := pα(t −s)K(t, s), with K(t, t) ̸= 0 on I. The fol-
lowing result can be found for example in Grossman and Miller (1970).
Theorem 7.1.5 Assume that the initial-value problem for the semilinear VIDE
(7.1.16) possesses a unique solution y ∈C1(I), and let
yℓ(t) := rα(t, 0)y0 +
 t
0
rα(t, s)g(s)ds,
t ∈I,
denote the solution of the linear VIDE
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
y(0) = y0.
Then y and yℓare related by
y(t) = yℓ(t) −

(7.1.17)
Here, rα(t, s) denotes the resolvent kernel associated with a and Hα describing
the linear part of (7.1.16).
Proof Setting Qα(t) := g(t) + (Hαy)(t), the semilinear VIDE (7.1.16) can be
written as
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + Qα(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I.
According to Theorem 7.1.1 the solution of this perturbed linear VIDE is for-
mally given by
y(t) = rα(t, 0)y0 +
 t
0
rα(t, s)Qα(s)ds,
t ∈I.
The representation of y in Theorem 7.1.2 now follows readily by observing the
resolvent equation (7.1.6) and by writing
 t
s
rα(t, v)Hα(v, s)dv = −rα(t, s)a(s) −∂rα(t, s)

We observe that when α = 0 the above result reduces to the one in Theorem
3.1.5.
7.1.3 Neutral and higher-order VIDEs

then this functional equation is the weakly singular counterpart of the (neutral)
ﬁrst-order VIDE (3.1.13). It can be viewed as a particular case of a weakly
singular kth-order VIDE
y(k)(t) = f (t, y(t), y′(t), . . . , y(k−1)(t)) + (Vαy)(t),

and corresponds to the kernel

We will often use the linear counterpart of this VIDE as the basis for our
subsequent convergence analysis: it is described by

The given functions g, aν and Kν are assumed to be continuous on I and D,
respectively. We note again that we allow the derivative of order k of y to occur
as argument in the kernel of the VIDE. Compare also Exercise 7.7.7 for the
more general form of (7.1.21),

We shall now brieﬂy show that, for α ∈(0, 1), the linear VIDE corresponding
to (7.1.20) and (7.1.21) possesses a unique solution y ∈Ck,1−α(I) satisfying a
prescribed set of initial conditions. An analogous (generally only local) exis-
tence and uniqueness result can be obtained for the nonlinear VIDE (7.1.19),
by a straightforward adaptation of the arguments presented below.

then the representation (7.1.24) permits the explicit derivation of the expressions
for the k + 1 components of the solution vector w(t), e.g. for w0(t) = y(t), in
analogy to Section 3.1.2.
This equivalence between the initial-value problem for the kth-order VIDE
(7.1.19)–(7.1.21) and the system of k + 1 linear Volterra integral equations of
the second kind (7.1.22) allows us, by appealing to Theorem 6.1.6, to obtain
the following.
Theorem 7.1.6 Let α ∈(0, 1) and assume that the aν (ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1)
and g are in C(I), and Kν ∈C(D), with Kν(t, t) ̸= 0 on I (ν = 0, 1, . . . , k).
Then for any initial values y(ν)
0
(ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1) the kth-order VIDE
(7.1.19) corresponding to (7.1.20), (7.1.21) possesses a unique solution y ∈
Ck,1−α(I) satifying the given initial conditions.
We leave it to the reader (see Exercise 7.7.8) to write down the analogue of
the solution representation (7.1.14) in Theorem 7.1.4.
The arguments leading from (7.1.18) to the system (7.1.23) remain valid for
α = 1 (when pα(t −s) = log(t −s)). Hence, we see by extending Theorem
6.1.7 to systems of second-kind VIEs with logarithmic kernel singularity that,
for any set of initial values, the the initial-value problem

|y(k+1)(t)| ≤C · t| log(t)|,
t ∈(0, T ],
provided the given functions are in C(I).
7.1.4 Weakly singular VIDEs with delay arguments
Let the Volterra integral operator Vθ,α be deﬁned as in Section 6.1.7, with the
delay function θ subject to (D1)–(D3). From what we have seen in Section 6.1.7
it is clear that the presence of this delay operator in the VIDE
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + g(t) + (Vαy)(t) + (Vθ,αy)(t),
t ∈I,
(7.1.25)
with initial condition y(t) = φ(t) on [θ(t0), t0], will affect the regularity of the
solution y at the points t = ξ +
µ (µ ≥0).

dt [a0y(t) −(Vθ,αy)(t)] = f (t, y(t), y(θ(t))),
(7.1.26)
where the coefﬁcient a0 is from {1, 0}.
The regularity results summarised in Table 7.1 are analogous to those in
Table 6.1 for weakly singular VIEs and generalise those described in Table 4.1
(Section 4.1.4). Their proofs can be found in Ma (2004). In analogy to Table
6.1 the range of the values µ is such that when the exponent of the indicated
H¨older space reaches m + 1, the reguarity on the remaining subintervals I (µ) is
Cm+1. We will not specify this in Table 7.1.

Hence, the uniqueness of the solution of the initial-value problem for the VIDE

to Dixon and McKee (1984).
Theorem 7.1.7 Assume that γ ∈C(I) is non-negative and non-decreasing on

7.2 Collocation for linear weakly singular VIDEs
7.2.1 The exact collocation equations
The weakly singular counterpart of the VIDE (3.2.1) is given by
y′(t) = f (t, y(t)) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ], y(0) = y0
(0 < α ≤1).

Hα(t, s)φ(s)ds :=
 t

pα(t −s)K(t, s)φ(s)ds,

Recall that the kernel singularity is either of algebraic type, pα(t −s) :=
(t −s)−α if 0 < α < 1, or of logarithmic type, pα(t −s) := log(t −s) when
α = 1. We will assume that K ∈C(D) and K(t, t) ̸= 0 (t ∈I). Later in this
chapter we shall also turn to fully nonlinear versions of (7.2.1), in particular to

(7.2.2)
with the familiar set Xh of collocation points,
Xh := {tn,i := tn + cihn : 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}.
If we admit sets {ci} where c1 = 0 and cm = 1 (m ≥2), then – as in the case
α = 0 – the collocation solution lies in the smoother space S(0)
m (Ih) ∩C1(I) =:
S(1)
m (Ih), provided the given functions f and k in (7.2.1) are continuous. How-
ever, since
dim S(1)
m (Ih) = N(m −1) + 2,
we need a second, ‘artiﬁcial’, initial condition, u′
h(0) = y′(0) = f (0, y0), in
order to start the recursive process given by the computational form of (7.2.2).
The memory term (Vαuh)(t) corresponding to t = tn,i may be written as

When the solution Yn of (7.2.9) has been found, the collocation solution on the
interval ¯σn is determined by
uh(tn + vhn) = yn + hnβT (v)Yn,
v ∈[0, 1],
(7.2.10)
where β(v) := (β1(v), . . . , βm(v))T ∈IRm.
Theorem 7.2.1 Assume that the functions a, g and K in the VIDE (7.2.1),
with f given by (7.2.6), are continuous on their respective domains I and D.
Then for any α ∈(0, 1] there exists an ¯h = ¯h(α) > 0 so that for any mesh Ih
with mesh diameter h ∈(0, ¯h), each of the linear algebraic systems (7.2.9) has
a unique solution Yn ∈IRm. Hence the collocation equation (7.2.2) deﬁnes a
unique collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for the initial-value problem (7.2.1),
(7.2.6), and its representation on the subinterval ¯σn is given by (7.2.10).
Proof It follows from the assumptions on a and K, and because the kernel Hα
is integrable for all α ∈(0, 1], that the matrices
Cn(α) := An + hnCn(α) (0 ≤n ≤N −1)
in (7.2.9) have bounded elements for any mesh Ih. The argument in the proof of
Theorem 2.2.1 can thus be used to deduce that the inverses [Im −hnCn(α)]−1
exist and are uniformly bounded for hn ∈(0, ¯h), with sufﬁciently small ¯h > 0.
This implies that each of the systems [Im −hnCn(α]Yn = gn + Gn(α) +
hnκn(α)yn is uniquely solvable for Yn ∈IRm when h = max(n) hn < ¯h. Hence,
for each n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1 the local representation (7.2.10) is uniquely de-
termined.

(7.2.11)
(since uh(tn + vhn) = yn + vhnYn,1 yields, for v = 1, hnYn,1 = yn+1 −yn).

The (exact) collocation equation (7.2.5) for the VIDE (7.2.1) is amenable to
numerical computations of uh only if the integrals in the equation (and in the
lag term (7.2.8)) can be found analytically. Since this will in general not be
possible, they will have to be approximated by appropriate numerical (product)
quadrature processes which, as in Section 6.2.1, will again be interpolatory
m-point product quadrature formulas whose abscissas are based on the collo-
cation parameters {ci}. Hence, using the notation of (6.2.20) and (6.2.21), the

Theorem 7.2.2 Assume that the given functions a, g and K in the linear
weakly singular VIDE (7.2.1), (7.2.6) satisfy the conditions of Theorem 7.2.1,
and let α ∈(0, 1]. If the corresponding exact collocation equation (7.2.7) is
discretised by means of the interpolatory m-point product quadrature formulas
(7.2.14), (7.2.15), then there exists an ˆh = ˆh(α) > 0 so that for any mesh Ih
with mesh diameter h ∈(0, ˆh), each of the linear systems (7.2.17) has a unique
solution ˆYn ∈IRm. Hence the discretised collocation equation (7.2.12) deﬁnes
a unique discrete collocation solution ˆuh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) whose restriction to ¯σn is
given by (7.2.16).
The proof is a straightforward adaptation of the one for Theorem 7.2.1 (or
Theorem 6.2.2): for ﬁxed m ≥1 the weights of the above interpolatory m-point
quadrature formulas are bounded for all h > 0, and hence, by the assumed
continuity of a and K, the matrices ˆCn(α) := An + hn ˆCn(α) ∈L(IRm) have
bounded elements for any hn. This implies that the inverses of the matrices
characterising the systems (7.2.16), Im −hn ˆCn(α) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N −1), exist
and are uniformly bounded for hn ∈(0, ˆh) for some ˆh > 0 which depends on
α and will in general be different from ¯h deﬁned in Theorem 7.2.1.

7.2.3 Global convergence results
We have seen in Section 7.1 that, typically, VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
but otherwise smooth data possess solutions that have an unbounded second
derivative at the left endpoint of the interval of integration. Thus, in analogy to
the results for weakly singular VIEs of the second kind, collocation solutions
in S(0)
m (Ih) with uniform mesh Ih will not converge with optimal (global) or-
der p = m. This result, and the one on how to recover optimal order, can be

444
7 VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
established in two different ways: we can either take the proof of the conver-
gence result for VIDEs with smooth solutions (Theorem 3.2.3) as our starting
point, with appropriate modiﬁcations – similar to the proof of Theorem 6.2.9
for weakly singular VIEs – of the remainder terms Rm+1,0(v) and R(1)
m+1,0(v) in
the local representations of eh and e′
h on the initial interval σ0 (recall (3.2.26)
and (3.2.27)). Alternatively, we may use the integrated form of the VIDE, as
discussed in Section 6.1.1, whose kernel is bounded but non-smooth, and then
apply Theorem 6.2.12 to the resulting second-kind VIE.
We begin by stating the basic global convergence result for the collocation
solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) to the linear VIDE
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(7.2.20)
where
(Vαy)(t) :=
 t
0
pa(t −s)K(t, s)y(s)ds
(0 < α < 1),
with K(t, t) ̸= 0, t ∈I.VIDEswithlogarithmickernelsingularity(α = 1)will
be considered in Theorem 7.2.5. Recall that our graded meshes on I := [0, T ]
are deﬁned by
Ih := {tn := (n/N)rT : 0 ≤n ≤N; r = r(α) ≥1}.
Theorem 7.2.3 Assume
(a) The given functions in (7.2.20) satisfy a, g ∈Cm(I), K ∈Cm(D), with
K(t, t) ̸= 0 for t ∈I.
(b) In the weakly singular part of Hα(t, s) := pα(t −s)K(t, s) we have 0 <
α < 1.
(c) uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the (unique) collocation solution to (7.2.20) deﬁned by
(7.2.9), (7.2.10), with h ∈(0, ¯h) and collocation points Xh.
(d) The grading exponent r = r(α) has the form
r =
µ
1 −α ,
with µ ≥1 −α.
Then, setting h := T/N, the estimates
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cν(r)

1 −α ≤µ < m,
hm
if
µ ≥m

cm ≤1. The constants Cν(r) depend on the collocation parameters {ci} and on
the grading exponent r = r(α), but not on h.
Proof The collocation error eh := y −uh satisﬁes the initial-value problem
e′
h(t) = a(t)eh(t) + (Veh)(t) −δh(t),
t ∈I,
eh(0) = 0.

The defect δh is deﬁned by
δh(t) := −u′
h(t) + a(t)uh(t) + g(t) + (Vαuh)(t),
t ∈I,
and vanishes on Xh. Recall now the analogous error equation (3.2.25) for
VIDEs, as well as the local representations (3.2.27) and (3.2.26) for eh and
e′
h, respectively:

n R(1)
m+1,n(v),
v ∈(0, 1],
(7.2.24)
with En, j := Zn, j −Yn, j. Since, according to Theorem 7.1.4, the solution y has
an unbounded second derivative at t = 0+, these representations are only valid
for n ≥1. On the ﬁrst subinterval ¯σ0 = [0, h0] we resort to the representation
(7.1.14) (Theorem 7.1.4) for the exact solution of (7.2.20) and the resulting
analogue to the error representation (6.2.39), with m replaced by m + 1. The
convergence analysis proceeds now along the lines we have mapped out in the
proofs of Theorem 3.2.3 and Theorem 6.2.9.
In order to avoid these repetitive arguments (the reader may wish to consult
Brunner (1985b, 1985c, 1986a) or Brunner and van der Houwen (1986, Chapter
6), we will describe a somewhat different approach to establishing the results
of Theorem 7.2.3. It is based on the easily veriﬁed fact that we may without
loss of generality consider the VIDE
y′(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I,
since the deleted term a(t)y(t) of (7.2.20) has, according to Theorem 7.1.4, no
smoothing effect on the solution. The error equation is then, for 0 < α < 1,

h(t) = δh(t) +

WeknowfromTheorem7.1.4that y′ ∈Cm,1−α(I).Hence,on ¯σ0,e′

with appropriately adapted meaning of the coefﬁcients β j,0(α) and the remain-
der terms Rm,0(v; α) (recall (6.2.39)). These observations imply that we may
now proceed exactly as in the proof of Theorem 6.2.9, to show that
|e′

v ∈[0, 1],
where ||β0(α)||1 ≤Bh1−α

is given by r = µ/(1 −α) then we obtain ﬁrst, in analogy to the proof of The-

Remarks
1. It is possible to show that on uniform meshes one obtains in fact the slightly
better order estimate ||eh||∞= O(h2−α) (see Tang (1992, 1993a)).
2. Tang (1992) showed that the collocation solution uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) correspond-
ing to collocation parameters with J0 = 0 and graded meshes with r ≥
(m + 1 −α)/(2 −α) satisﬁes
||eh||∞= O(N −(m+1−α)) and
max
t∈Xh |e′
h(t)| = O(N −(m+1−α)).
Moreover, the choice r > m/(2 −α) implies ||eh||∞= O(N −m) for any set
{ci} (Tang (1993a)).
The papers by Brunner, Pedas and Vainikko (2001a, 2001b) contain a com-
plete global convergence and superconvergence analysis for linear VIDEs with
weakly singular kernels (see also Kangro and Parts (2003) for related results).
It complements the analysis in Tang (1992, 1993a) not only by admitting
logarithmic kernel singularities but also by giving optimal L p-estimates. We
cite two typical results. Their proofs can be found in the above-mentioned
papers.
Theorem 7.2.4 Let 0 < α < 1, d ≥m, and assume:
(a) a, g ∈Cd(I);
(b) K ∈Cd(D), and K(t, t) ̸= 0 on I;
(c) uh is the collocation solution to (7.2.20) in S(0)
m (Ih), with graded mesh Ih
governed by some grading exponent r ≥1.

7.3 Hammerstein-type VIDEs with weakly
singular kernels
We brieﬂy consider the nonlinear VIDE
y′(t) = g(t) +
 t
0
pα(t −s)K(t, s)G(s, y(s))ds,
t ∈I,
(7.3.1)
with y(0) = y0, α ∈(0, 1] and K(t, t) ̸= 0 on I. Systems of this kind arise for
example in the spatial semidiscretisation of certain partial VIDEs with weakly
singular kernels, as studied by, e.g. Lubich, Sloan and Thom´ee (1996) and
McLean and Thom´ee (1997). Compare also Chapter 7 in the monograph by
Chen and Shih (1998).
As an alternative to using ‘direct’ collocation in S(0)
m (Ih), with appropriate
mesh grading as discussed in Section 7.2.1, we rewrite this VIDE as a second-
kind VIE,
y(t) = g0(t) +
 t
0
K0(t, s; α)G(y(s))ds,
t ∈I,
(7.3.2)
where
g0(t) := y0 +
 t
0
g(s)ds
and
K0(t, s; α) :=
 t
s
pα(v −s)K(v, s)dv.
If the solution of this VIE is approximated by uh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), followed by an
iteration step to generate uit
h , then (by Theorem 6.2.12)
||y −uit
h ||∞≤C(r)hm
if r ≥m/(2 −α).
Since the VIE (7.4.2) is of Hammerstein type, it can also be solved by
implicitly linear collocation, especially if K(t, s) is constant on D. Setting
z(t) := G(t, y(t)) we obtain
z(t) = G

t, g0(t) +
 t

K0(t, s; α)z(s)ds

,
and hence
y(t) = g0(t) +
 t
0
K0(t, s; α)z(s)ds,
t ∈I.
As we have seen in Section 6.2.9, this approach will often avoid the need of
having to resort to quadrature approximations in order to make the ‘direct’ col-
location equations amenable to numerical computations. For details, including
convergence estimates based on optimally graded meshes, we refer to Section
6.2.9 and Theorem 6.2.16: in the latter, the role of the optimal grading exponent

(7.4.2)
with
(Vα,1φ)(t) :=
 t

pα(t −s)K1(t, s)φ(s)ds,
and
(Vα,2φ)(t) :=
 t
0
pα(t −s)K2(t, s)φ(s)ds,
as special cases of higher-order neutral VIDEs. In this section we shall derive the
collocation equations and corresponding convergence results for the latter, and
so obtain the analogues of Theorems 3.2.11–3.2.13 (Section 3.2.6) for (3.2.44).
They then yield as special cases convergence order estimates for (7.4.1) and
(7.4.2).
Let k ≥2 be a given integer and consider the initial-value problem
y(k)(t) = f (t, y(t), y′(t), . . . , y(k−1)(t)) + (Vαy)(t),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
y(ν)(0) = y(ν)

(ν = 0, 1, . . . , k −1),

where, as in Section 7.1.3,
(Vαy)(t) :=

hα(t, s, y(s), y′(s), . . . , y(k)(s))ds,
with
hα(t, s, y, y′, . . . , y(k)) := pα(t −s)k(t, s, y, y′, . . . , y(k))
and 0 < α ≤1.

The given functions aν and Kν are assumed to be continuous on I and D,
respectively.
The collocation solution for (7.4.3) will be sought in the ‘natural’ smooth
piecewise polynomial space
S(d)
m+d(Ih) := {uh ∈Cd(I) : uh| ¯σn ∈πm+d (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}
with d = k −1 ≥1 and, as the reader will recall, dim S(d)
m+d(Ih) = Nm + d +

7 VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
Substitution of these local representations in (7.4.6), with t = tn,i (i.e. v =
ci, i = 1, . . . , m) yields a system of algebraic equations for Yn ∈IRm, and its
solution determines the values of the collocation solution and its k derivatives
on σn, via (7.4.7).

we cite a theorem (due to Tang and Yuan (1990)) for (7.3.10),(7.3.16) (k = 2).
(The original result was proved only for kernels of the form hα(t, s, y); however,
it is readily extended to the general case where hα(t, s, y, y′, y′′).) Note that for

smooth data the exact solution of (7.4.10) lies in the space C2,1−α(I) and has
an unbounded third derivative at t = 0+ that behaves like |y′′′(t)| ≤Ct−α.
Theorem 7.4.1 Assume:
(a) The given functions aν, g and Kν in (7.4.10) and (7.4.16) possess contin-
uous derivatives of order m on their respective domains I and D.
(b) uh ∈S(1)
m+1(Ih) is the collocation solution deﬁned by (7.4.12)–(7.4.15), and
the underlying mesh Ih is graded, with r = µ/(1 −α) ≥1.
Then for any α ∈(0, 1) the estimates
||y(ν) −u(ν)
h ||∞≤Cν(r)
 hµ
if
1 −α ≤µ ≤m,
hm
if
µ ≥m
hold for ν = 0, 1, 2 and all {ci} with 0 ≤c1 < . . . < cm ≤1.
Reﬁned estimates, analogous to those given in Theorems 7.2.4 and 7.2.5,
can also be derived. We leave this as a research exercise (Exercise 7.7.13).
7.5 Non-polynomial spline collocation methods
The solution representation (7.1.14) in Section 7.1.5 suggests that, on uniform
Ih, it may be more natural to seek the collocation solution to the weakly singular
VIDE (7.2.20) in a special non-polynomial spline space based on the expan-
sion (7.1.14) of the exact solution y. In analogy to Section 6.4.1 we choose a
collocation space Z(0)
m (Ih) with the property that on ¯σ0 = [t0, t1] (t0 = 0) any
element zh from this space reduces to
zh(t0 + vh) =

( j,k)2−α
b j,kv j+k(2−α),
v ∈[0, 1],
(7.5.1)
where ( j, k)2−α := {( j, k) : j + k(2 −α) < m + 1, j, k ∈IN0} and b j,k =
b j,k(h). This local representation thus exactly matches the terms in the ﬁrst
expression on the right-hand side of (7.1.14)). The error analysis for the cor-
responding collocation solution zh can then be carried out along familiar lines
(using a standard Gronwall argument, as in the proof of Theorem 7.2.3), and it
reveals that ∥y(ν) −z(ν)
h ∥∞= O(hm) for ν = 0, 1. The details can be found in
Brunner (1983, pp. 1116–1119).
Variants of this non-polynomial collocation method were studied by Hu
(1996a, 1998b): he employed collocation solutions based on so-called piece-
wise β-polynomials (employing integer powers of tβ, with suitable β, as basis
functions); the mesh Ih is a specially chosen geometric mesh.

7 VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
7.6 Weakly singular Volterra functional
integro-differential equations
7.6.1 Weakly singular VIDEs with non-vanishing delays
The result in Lemma 6.5.1 shows that the attainable order of (super-) conver-
gence of collocation solutions to VIDEs with non-vanishing delays and weakly
singular kernels will depend on whether the lag function θ is linear or nonlinear.
Hence, in analogy to Theorem 6.5.2, if θ in the equations
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + g(t) + (Vαy)(t) + (Vθ,αy)(t),
t ∈I,
(7.6.1)
or
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(θ(t)) + g(t) + (Wθ,αy)(t),
t ∈I,
(7.6.2)
is linear, the optimal orders derived in Theorem 7.2.3 are also attained by the
collocation solutions uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) for (7.6.1) and (7.6.2), provided the mesh
Ih is θ-invariant and the ﬁrst submesh I (0)
h
is optimally graded. For nonlinear θ
this is no longer valid. We summarise these fact in
Theorem 7.6.1 Assume
(a) The given functions a, b, K1, K2, K in (7.6.1) and (7.6.2) are d ≥
m-times continuously differentiable on their respective domains, φ ∈
Cd+1[θ(t0, t0], and the lag function satisﬁes (D1)–(D3).
(b) uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) is the collocation solution to (7.6.1) or (7.6.2), with θ-
invariant mesh Ih.
(c) The ﬁrst submesh I (0)
h
is optimally graded:
t(0)
n
:= t0 +
 n
N
r0 (ξ0 −t0) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N),
with r0 =
m
1 −α .
(I) If θ is linear, the results of Theorems 7.2.3 and 7.2.4 remain valid on each
subinterval I (µ) := [ξµ, ξµ+1]:
∥y(ν) −u(ν)
h ∥µ,∞:= sup
t∈I (µ) |y(ν)(t) −u(ν)
h (t)| ≤Cν N −m
(0 ≤µ ≤M; ν = 0, 1).
If the collocation parameters are such that J0 = 0 holds, and if d ≥m + 1,
then we obtain
∥y −uh∥µ,∞≤C(α)N −(m+1−α)
whenever r ≥m + 1 −α
2 −α
.
(II) If θ is nonlinear, the results of Theorems 7.2.3 and 7.2.4 are in general valid
only on I (0). On the subsequent subintervals I (µ) (µ ≥1) the attainable orders

457
of ∥y(ν) −uν
h∥µ,∞(ν = 0, 1) will be less than m and lie between 1 −α and m,
except when m = 1 and we have smoothing in the exact solution.
Remarks
1. For linear lag functions the (super-) convergence results of Brunner, Pedas
andVainikko(2001a,2001b),inparticularthoseinvolvinglogarithmickernel
singularities, remain true for second-kind delay VIDEs with weakly singular,
or bounded but non-smooth, kernels. The same is true for the convergence
estimates corresponding to a more reﬁned choice of the grading exponent
(recall Remark 2 following the proof of Theorem 7.2.3).
2. If θ is nonlinear, we can – as for weakly singular VIEs with weakly singular
kernels – again achieve global convergence order p = m, by resorting to
submeshes that are individually graded:
r If the solution y has Cµ+1,1−α-regularity at t = ξ +
µ (cf. Table 7.1) then –
according to Theorem 7.2.3 – the optimal grading exponent for I (µ)
h
is
rµ =



m
µ + 1 −α
for µ = 0, 1, . . . , min{m, M},
1
for µ = m + 1, . . . , M.
r If y has only C1,1−α-regularity at each ξ +
µ (no smoothing), then we choose
rµ = m/(1 −α) for all µ = 0, 1, . . . , M.
We recall from Section 6.5.1 that the corresponding global mesh Ih is now
no longer θ-invariant.

7.8 Notes
7.1: Review of basic Volterra theory (IV)
The regularity properties of solutions to VIDEs with weakly singular kernels are
analysed in Lubich (1983a), Brunner (1983, 1985b, 1985c) and – especially –
in Brunner, Pedas and Vainikko (2001a, 2001b). See also Kiryakova (1994) and
Meehan and O’Regan (1999) for related results.
There is an extensive literature on the regularity of solutions to partial VIDEs
of parabolic type. We mention DaPrato, Iannelli and Sinestrari (1985), Lunardi
and Sinestrari (1986), Sanz-Serna (1988), Choi and MacCamy (1989), Grasselli
and Lorenzi (1991), Sforza (1991), Pr¨uss (1993), Chen and Shih (1998, Chapter
7), Cl´ement and Londen (2000), and Gripenberg, Cl´ement and Londen (2000).
See also the two papers by Fujita (1990).
The mathematics underlying Volterra functional integro-differential equa-
tions with non-vanishing delays has received much attention since the early
1980s. In particular, the semigroup framework for (d/dt)[(Wθ,αy)(t)] =
f (t) (θ(t) = t −τ, 0 < α < 1) is discussed in, e.g. Burns, Herdman and Stech

7.2: Collocation for linear weakly singular VIDEs
A comprehensive analysis of global and local superconvergence in collocation
solutions on graded meshes for linear weakly singular VIDEs (with 0 < α ≤1)
is given in Brunner, Pedas and Vainikko (2001a, 2001b). Earlier results (for
0 < α < 1) were given by Brunner (1985b, 1985c, 1986a), Brunner and Tang
(1989) (for the Basset equation), Tang (1992, 1993a). The paper by Kangro and
Parts (reﬁnes some of the results by Brunner, Pedas and Vainikko.
The discontinuous Galerkin method for such VIDEs is studied in Brunner
and Sch¨otzau (2002) (hp-method) and in the dissertation by Ma (2004).
Waveform and timepoint relaxation methods for solving large systems of nonlin-
ear systems of weakly singular VIDEs (and their discrete versions) are described
and analysed in Parsons (1999); also VIEs: Brunner, Crisci, Russo and Vecchio
(2003).
7.3: Hammerstein-type VIDEs with weakly singular kernels

with weakly singular kernels.

7.4: Higher-order weakly singular VIDEs
The convergence and numerical performance of collocation methods for such
problems were studied by Papatheodorou and Jesanis (1980) (general mth-order
VIDEs), Prosperetti (1982), and by Tang and Yuan (1990) (k = 2: extension of
results of Brunner (1986a)).
7.5: Non-polynomial spline collocation methods
Collocation solutions in special non-polynomial spline spaces (and uniform
meshes) were ﬁrst analysed by Brunner (1983). Hu (1996a, 1998b) combines
so-called β-polynomials with geometric meshes to obtain superconvergent non-
polynomial spline collocation solutions.
We note that Keller (1982) used special non-polynomial collocation spaces
for (stiff) ODEs; these spaces also reﬂect certain known properties of the solu-
tion of the given problem.
7.6: Weakly singular Volterra functional integro-differential equations
The survey papers by Brunner (1999a, 1999c) describe the many open problems
in the numerical analysis of VIEs and VIDEs with weakly singular kernels and
non-vanishing delays.
Parabolic VIDEs with weakly singular kernels
There are numerous papers on time-stepping in spatially semidiscretised ver-
sions of such PVIDEs; see, e.g. Sanz-Serna (1988), L´opez-Marcos (1990),
and Tang (1993b) (Burgers’ equation with weakly singular Volterra memory
term, 0 < α < 1), Chen, Thom´ee and Wahlbin (1992), Xu (1993, 1998), Y. Lin
(1994), Chen and Shih (1998), and Larsson, Thom´ee and Wahlbin (1998) (also
for additional references). The hp-discontinuous Galerkin method described in
Brunner and Sch¨otzau (2002) extends the approach by Sch¨otzau and Schwab
(2000, 2001) to parabolic VIDEs with weakly singular memory term; see also
the Ph.D. thesis of Ma (2004). Related papers of interest are by Kim and Choi
(1998) (spectral collocation) and by Cuesta and Palencia (2003) (fractional
trapezoidal method for abstract VIDEs).

Outlook: integral-algebraic equations
and beyond
Summary: As we mentioned in the Preface the voyage through the previous
seven chapters has now brought us in many ways to the ‘frontier’ of what
is known about the analysis of collocation methods. Thus, in this chapter we
will make this more precise, ﬁrst by reviewing recent and current work on
collocation methods for DAEs and Volterra-type integral-algebraic equations
(IAEs) of index 1. This will be followed by an exploration of various directions
for future research on IAEs in particular, and collocation methods in general,
in more abstract settings that may contain the key to the solution of many of
the open problems encountered earlier.
8.1 Basic theory of DAEs and IAEs
The purpose of this section, especially Section 8.1.1, is to present some of the
modern tools that will be required in the analysis of collocation methods for
integral-algebraic equations of Volterra type. Thus, we present a fairly detailed
introduction to the basic theory of (index-1) DAEs: this will allow us better
to appreciate the complexity behind the analysis of collocation methods for
IAEs and, especially, IDAEs of higher index. As we have just said, much of the
quantitative and qualitative analysis of collocation solutions to such problems
remains to be carried out.
The reader not familar with the theory and numerical analysis of DAEs will
ﬁnd good introductions to these subjects in the monographs by Griepentrog and
M¨arz (1986), Hairer, Lubich and Roche (1989), Brenan, Campbell and Petzold
(1996), and the surveys by M¨arz (1992, 1994), Rabier and Rheinboldt (2002),
and Schulz (2003).

8.1.1 DAEs: a brief introduction
A system of implicit ODEs,
(x′(t), x(t), t) = 0,
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(8.1.1)
where  : IRd × IRd × I →IRd (d ≥2) is said to be a system of differential-
algebraic equations (or simply: a DAE) if the Jacobian ∂/∂x′ is singular for
all values of its arguments. If ∂/∂x′ is regular on IRd × IRd × I, then (8.1.1)
is a regular (implicit) ODE.
If the DAE (8.1.1) has the form
y′(t) = F(t, y(t), z(t)),
(8.1.2)
0 = G(t, y(t), z(t)),
t ∈I,
with (continuous) functions F : I × IRd1 × IRd2 →IRd1 and G : I × IRd1 ×
IRd2 →IRd2, it is called is a semi-explicit DAE. The component z(t) in the
solution x(t) = (y(t), z(t))T (with y ∈IRd1 and z ∈IRd2) is referred to as
its algebraic component. In this chapter we will restrict the discussion to
semi-explicit DAEs (and analogous integral-algebraic and integro-differential-
algebraic equations; see Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3).
The system (8.1.2) is complemented by a given set of initial values, x(0) =
(y(0), z(0))T = (y0, z0)T : it will be assumed that these values are consistent,
that is, they satisfy
G(0, y0, z0) = 0
(8.1.3)
(see also Griepentrog and M¨arz (1989)). The general semilinear version of the
DAE (8.1.1) is given by
A(t)x′(t) + b(x(t), t) = 0,
t ∈I,
(8.1.4)
where A(·) ∈L(IRd) is continuous and singular (but has constant rank at least
one) for all t ∈I, and b : IRd × I →IRd is (Lipschitz) continuous. The semi-
explicit form of the linear DAE
A(t)x′(t) + B(t)x(t) = q(t),
t ∈I.
(8.1.5)
with continuous B(·) : I →IRd, corresponds to
A(t) = diag (Id1, Od2)

8.1 Basic theory of DAEs and IAEs

and is thus given by the more structured system
y′(t) + B11(t)y(t) + B12(t)z(t) = q1(t),
(8.1.6)
B21(t)y(t) + B22(t)z(t) = q2(t),
t ∈I.
(8.1.7)
The matrix functions Bkk(·) ∈L(IRdk) (k = 1, 2) and B12(·) ∈L(IRd2, IRd1),
B21(·) ∈L(IRd1, IRd2) are assumed to be continuous on I, as are q1 : I →IRd1
and q2 : I →IRd2.
It was shown by Rheinboldt (1984) (see also Hairer and Wanner (1996,
pp. 457–458) and Rabier and Rheinboldt (1994, 2002)) that DAEs may be
viewed as differential equations on manifolds, with the manifolds described
by the given algebraic constraints in the DAE. This geometric interpretation
adds considerable insight into the behaviour of solutions to DAEs and into
the properties a feasible numerical method must have. (See also the related
remark in Section 8.3 and Exercise 8.6.12 on the geometry of IDAEs!) While
the geometry is relatively simple for so-called index-1 DAEs like
y′(t) = F(y(t), z(t)),
(8.1.8)
0 = G(y(t), z(t)),
t ∈I
(where G is smooth and has non-vanishing Jacobian ∂G/∂z), it becomes much
more complex if the DAE has the (‘index-2’) form
y′(t) = F(y(t), z(t)),
(8.1.9)
0 = G(y(t)),
t ∈I.
The notion of index is crucial for the classiﬁcation of DAEs, as the above
examples indicate. There exist several different (but often closely related) def-
initions of the index of a DAE. Somewhat loosely speaking, we say that the
semi-linear DAE (8.1.4) has
r differentiation index 1 if, and only if, a single differentiation of the algebraic
constraints yields a system of (implicit) regular ODEs;
r perturbation index 1 if, and only if, perturbations in the right-hand side of
(8.1.4) lead to perturbations in the solution that can be estimated in terms of
the original perturbations, with the estimate not depending on derivatives of
the input.
r tractability index 1 if, and only if, the algebraic constraints are locally solv-
able for the algebraic components of the solution x.
For details and, especially, the extension of the above deﬁnitions to DAEs
with index 2 and higher, and to fully nonlinear DAEs, we refer the reader to

8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
Griepentrog and M¨arz (1986), M¨arz (1987, 1989, 1992, 2002a), Gear (1990),
Hairer,LubichandRoche(1989),Brenan,CampbellandPetzold(1996),andthe
recent survey by Schulz (2003). Lamour (2001) presents a general algorithm,
based on the notion of the tractability index, for computing this index.
In the following we will follow the route chosen by R. M¨arz and her collab-
orators and employ the tractability index, not least because it requires minimal
regularity assumptions. Also, it can easily be seen that if (8.1.4) possesses
tractability index 1, then its perturbation index is also 1; the same is true for
the differentiation index, provided b has sufﬁcient regularity. This close rela-
tionship no longer remains true for DAEs of index 2 or higher (compare also
Hairer, Lubich and Roche (1989, pp. 12–13), and Schulz (2003)).
Deﬁnition 8.1.1
(i) The matrix pencil p(λ) := det(A + λB) (A, B ∈L(IRd), λ ∈C) associ-
ated with the linear DAE with constant coefﬁcients,
Ax′(t) + Bx(t) = q(t),
t ∈I
(det(A) = 0, rank(A) ≥1),
(8.1.10)
is called a regular matrix pencil if p(λ) ̸≡0 (that is, if there is a λ for which
A + λB is a regular matrix). We will denote the matrix pencil associated
with the matrices A and B by {A, B}.
(ii) The DAE (8.1.10) is said to be tractable if its matrix pencil {A, B} is
regular.
We leave it to the reader to discuss the phenonema that can occur if the matrix
pencil associated with (8.1.10) is singular.
In order to make the meaning of Deﬁnition 8.1.1 more transparent, assume
that {A, B} is a regular matrix pencil. It then follows from a result by Weierstrass
(see, e.g. Griepentrog and M¨arz (1986, pp. 14–23) or Brenan, Campbell and
Petzold (1996, pp. 18–22) for details) that there exist regular matrices E, F ∈
L(IRd) so that

∈L(IRd−k):
here, the Ji denote (nilpotent) Jordan blocks in L(IRmi). The pencil { ˜A, ˜B} is
called the Kronecker normal form of the regular matrix pencil {A, B}, and the

8.1 Basic theory of DAEs and IAEs
467
corresponding transformed DAE is
˜A˜x′(t) + ˜B ˜x(t) = ˜q(t),
t ∈I,
where ˜x(t) := F−1x(t), ˜q(t) := Eq(t).
Deﬁnition 8.1.2 The index of nilpotency of {A, B} is
µp := max{mi : i = 1, . . . , ν}.
It is not difﬁcult to see that the perturbation index of the linear DAE (8.1.10)
equals its index of nilpotency.
The given DAE (8.1.10) can therefore be decoupled into a system of (regular)
differential equations of the form
˜y′(t) + W ˜y(t) = ˜q1(t),
(8.1.11)
J ˜z′(t) + ˜z(t) = ˜q2(t),
t ∈I,
(8.1.12)
with obvious meaning of ˜y(t) and ˜z(t). This DAE is referred to as the Kronecker
normal form of the DAE (8.1.10). It is described by the regular ODE (8.1.11)
for ˜y and the ‘backward system’ (8.1.12) for the algebraic components ˜z. Note
that if we have mi = 1 for i = 1, . . . , ν, then the components of ˜z are given
in terms of those of ˜q2, and no derivatives of ˜z are needed. In other words, the
index of nilpotency equals one, and this is also the index of tractability of the
original DAE (8.1.10).
While the Kronecker normal form also exists for DAEs (8.1.5) with variable
coefﬁcients A(t), B(t)(see,e.g.GearandPetzold(1984)),thereisamoreelegant
(and practically very feasible – see Lamour (2001, 2003)) way to describe the
index of tractability. It was introduced by Griepentrog and M¨arz (1986) and is
based on the null space of A(t) and certain matrix chains associated with it.
Details can be found in, e.g. Griepentrog and M¨arz (1986), M¨arz (1992, 2002a,
2002b), and Schulz (2003). Here we will describe the basic ideas for the index-1
case. See also Lamour (2001, 2003) on the computational determination of the
tractability index of a DAE.
Assume that A(·) ∈L(IRd) is singular for all t ∈I := [0, T ] but has constant
rank r ≥1. We introduce the subspaces
N(t) := ker A(t) := {w ∈IRd : A(t)w = 0}
(the null space of A(t)) and, for B(·) ∈L(IRd) in (8.1.5),
S(t) := {w ∈IRd : B(t)w ∈im A(t)},
where im A(·) := {A(·)w : w ∈IRd} denotes the image of A(·) ∈L(IRd). This
space obviously contains every solution of the homogeneous DAE (8.1.5).

468
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
Moreover, we assume that N(t) (t ∈I) is spanned by d −r continuously dif-
ferentiable basis functions. Then there exists a matrix function Q(·) ∈L(IRd),
with Q ∈C1(I), that projects IRd pointwise onto N(t):
(Q(t))2 = Q(t),
im Q(t) = N(t),
t ∈I.
(8.1.13)
For such a projector Q(t) deﬁne P(t) := Id −Q(t), t ∈I. It follows that
A(t) = A(t)P(t), since we have, by deﬁnition of Q(t),
0 = A(t)Q(t) = A(t)[Id −P(t)] = A(t) −A(t)P(t),
t ∈I.
Hence, the DAE (8.1.5) can be rewritten as
A(t)[(P(t)x(t))′ −P′(t)x(t)] + B(t)x(t) = q(t),
or as
A(t)[P(t)x(t)]′ + [B(t) −A(t)P′(t)]x(t) = q(t),
t ∈I.
(8.1.14)
This reformulation, incidentally, also yields information about the feasible func-
tion space in which the solution x is to be sought: instead of requiring that
x ∈C1(I), we deﬁne a solution to be an element of the space
C1
N(I) := {x ∈C(I) : P(·)x ∈C1(I)}.
Lemma 8.1.1 Let N(t) be the null space of A(t) in (8.1.5), and assume that
the projector Q(t) satiﬁes (8.1.13). Then the DAE (8.1.14) decomposes into the
system
[P(t)x]′ −P′(t)P(t)x + P(t)A−1
1 (t)B0(t)P(t)x = P(t)A−1
1 (t)q(t),
(8.1.15)
Q(t)x + Q(t)A−1
1 (t)B0(t)P(t)x = Q(t)A−1
1 (t)q(t).
(8.1.16)
Here, we have introduced the matrix functions
B0(t) := B(t) −A(t)P′(t),
A1(t) := A(t) + B0(t)Q(t).
Proof Using the deﬁnition of Q(t) and P(t) (and omitting the argument t) we
ﬁrst write (8.1.14) as
A(Px)′ + (B −AP′)(Px + Qx) = q.
Since AP = A, Q2 = 0 and QP = 0 we obtain
{A + (B −AP′)Q}{P(Px)′ + Qx} + (B −AP′)Px = q.
(8.1.17)
This motivates the deﬁnition of the matrix functions B0 and A1. If A1 is non-
singular for all t ∈I, we multiply (8.1.17) by P A−1
1
and Q A−1
1 , respectively,

8.1 Basic theory of DAEs and IAEs
469
and this yields the system
(Px)′ −P′Px + P A−1
1 B0Px = P A−1
1 q,
(8.1.18)
Qx + Q A−1
1 B0Px = Q A−1
1 q.
(8.1.19)
We see that the second component (8.1.19) of this system is derivative free and
determines the null space component Qx of the solution once Px is known.
The non-null space component w := Px (note that P is non-singular) is given
by the solution of the so-called inherent regular ODE,
w′ −P′w + P A−1
1 B0w = P A−1
1 q,
associated with the DAE (8.1.5).
The proof of the following criterion for A1(t) to be non-singular on I is left
as an exercise.
Lemma 8.1.2 The matrix A1(t) = B(t) + B0(t)Q(t) is non-singular for all
t ∈I if, and only if, the direct sum of the spaces N0(t) := N(t) and
S0(t) := s(t){w ∈IRd : B0(t)w ∈im A(t)} = {w ∈IRd : B(t)w ∈im A(t)}
spans IRd:
S0(t) ⊕N0(t) = IRd
for all t ∈I.
(8.1.20)
We are now ready to characterise linear DAEs with variable coefﬁcients that
are index-1 tractable.
Deﬁnition 8.1.3 Consider the linear DAE (8.1.5) whose coefﬁcients are con-
tinuous matrix functions in L(IRd), and assume that on I, det A(t) = 0, A(t)
has constant rank, and its null space N(t) is smooth. Then (8.1.5) is said to be
index-1 tractable if
det A1(t) ̸= 0 for all t ∈I.
Here, A1(t) is deﬁned in Lemma 8.1.1.
It can be shown that the tractability index does not depend on the choice of
the projector Q.
We will use these insights into the ‘inner’ structure of linear DAEs to obtain
a better understanding of the semi-explicit DAE given by (8.1.6) and (8.1.7).
We start with
Theorem 8.1.3 The semi-explicit DAE (8.1.6),(8.1.7) is index-1 tractable if
B22(t) is non-singular on I.

We now formalise the above discussion by introducing the important concept
of a (numerically) properly stated DAE. Our starting point is the linear DAE
(8.1.5) which we now write in the form
¯A(t)(D(t)x(t))′ + ¯B(t)x(t) = g(t),
t ∈I,
(8.1.21)
where ¯A(·) ∈L(IRd0, IRd), D(·) ∈L(IRd, IRd0)and ¯B(·) ∈L(IRd)arecontinuous
on I. Here, we usually (but not always) have d0 = d. The term ¯A(t)(D(t)x(t))
is called the leading term of the DAE (8.1.21).
Deﬁnition 8.1.4 The leading term of the DAE (8.1.21) is said to be properly
stated if the matrices ¯A(t) and D(t) have the property that
im D(t) ⊕ker ¯A(t) = IRd
for all t ∈I,
with the subspaces im D(t) and ker ¯A(t) spanned by C1 bases.
The matrices ¯A(t) and D(t) in (8.1.21) are then called well matched.
The following statements are readily veriﬁed.
Lemma 8.1.4 Assume that the matrices ¯A(t) and D(t) are well matched. Then:
(i) rank ¯A(t) = rank D(t) =: r is constant on I;
(ii) im ¯A(t)D(t) = im A(t),
ker ¯A(t)D(t) = ker D(t);
(iii) ker ¯A(t) 	 im D(t) = ∅.
If the matrix A(·) ∈L(IRd) in the DAE (8.1.5) has constant rank and admits
a factorisation A(t) = ¯A(t)D(t) (t ∈I) so that ¯A(·) and D(·) are continuously
differentiable matrix functions on I that are well matched, then the left-hand
side of the DAE can be written in the form
¯A(t)D(t)x(t) + B(t)x(t) = ¯A(t)(D(t)x(t))′ + [B(t) −¯A(t)D′(t)]x(t),
(8.1.22)
in analogy to (8.1.14).
8.1.2 IAEs with smooth kernels
We now turn to ‘mixed’ systems of Volterra integral equations,
A(t)x(t) = q(t) +

 t
0
k(t, s, x(s))ds,
t ∈I,
(8.1.23)

8.1 Basic theory of DAEs and IAEs
471
with continuous A(·) ∈L(IRd) as in (8.1.4) and (8.1.5) (that is, det A(t) = 0 and
rank A(t) ≥1 on I). The semi-explicit linear version of this system is
y(t) = q1(t) + (V11y)(t) + (V12z)(t),
(8.1.24)
0 = q2(t) + (V21y)(t) + (V22z)(t),
t ∈I,
(8.1.25)
where the Volterra integral operators Vkl are given by
(Vklφ)(t) :=

 t
0
Kkl(t, s)φ(s)ds
(k,l = 1, 2).
(8.1.26)
The
matrix
kernels
Kkl(·, ·) (k,l = 1, 2):
Kkk(·, ·) ∈L(IRdk), K12(·, ·) ∈
L(IRd2, IRd1), and K21(·, ·) ∈L(IRd1, IRd2) are assumed to be continuous (or pos-
sibly unbounded but integrable). We will always assume that q2(0) = 0.
As the nonlinear analogue we will choose the one based on Hammerstein
operators,
y(t) = q1(t) +

 t
0
K1(t, s)G1(s, y(s), z(s))ds,
(8.1.27)
0 = q2(t) +

K2(t, s)G2(s, y(s), z(s))ds,
t ∈I,
(8.1.28)
with continuous Kk(·, ·) ∈L(IRdk) (k = 1, 2); the functions G1 : I × IRd1 ×
IRd2 →IRd1 and G2 : I × IRd1 × IRd2 →IRd2 are assumed to be smooth. We
set again x(t) := (y(t), z(t))T .
In accordance with the terminology introduced by Gear (1990) we will refer
to these systems of Volterra integral equations as integral-algebraic equations
of Volterra type (or IAEs in short since we will not discuss Fredholm-type
integral equations). Here, the word ‘algebraic’ assumes a wider meaning, in
that it refers to the ‘non-differential’ constraints forming part of the system.
Deﬁnition 8.1.5 The semi-explicit IAE (8.1.24/25) is said to be index-1
tractable if the ﬁrst-kind VIE corresponding to the Volterra operator V22,
(V22w)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I,
(8.1.29)
is uniquely solvable in C(I) whenever g ∈C1(I) and g(0) = 0.
In the following we will focus again on index-1 IEAs, in analogy to DAEs
in Section 8.1.1. Thus, the key question concerns the unique solvability for z(t)
of the (linear or nonlinear) ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equations (8.1.25) and
(8.1.28) replacing the algebraic equations in (8.1.7) and (8.1.2).
Note ﬁrst that when we have
∂K2l(t, s)/∂t = 0 on D

472
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
if V21 and V22 are linear, or
∂Kk(t, s)/∂t = 0 on D
in the nonlinear (Hammerstein) case, then differentiation of these ﬁrst-kind
integral equations leads to (linear or nonlinear) algebraic constraints,
0 = g′(t) + K21(t)y(t) + K22(t)z(t)
and
0 = g′(t) + K2(t)G2(t, y(t), z(t)),
respectively.
In order to deal with the general case of integral constraints, we resort
to Theorems 2.1.8 and 6.1.16 (with α = 0). It follows from the former that
the linear VIE (8.1.25) is (formally) uniquely solvable for z ∈C(I) if we as-
sume q2 ∈C1(I), with q2(0) = 0, and if given matrix functions K21(·, ·) ∈
L(IRd1, L(IRd2), K22(·, ·) ∈L(IRd2) describing the Volterra operators V21, V22
in (8.1.25) are all continuous on their domains D and in addition satisfy
K21 ∈C1(D);
K22 ∈C1(D),
with | det K22(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0, t ∈I.
(8.1.30)
We now turn to the nonlinear IAE (8.1.28): in this case, Theorem 6.1.16)
(α = 0) reveals the additional conditions we have to impose on G2. To see this
in the present context, consider the differentiated form of (8.1.28),
0 = q′

(8.1.31)
Thus, this implicit VIE is uniquely solvable for z ∈C(I) if K2(·, ·) ∈L(IRd2)
is continuously differentiable, with | det K2(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 (t ∈I), and if G2
satisﬁes, for y ∈IRd1, z, ˜z ∈IRd2 (z ̸= ˜z),
⟨G2(t, y, z) −G2(t, y, ˜z), z −˜z)⟩> 0,

(8.1.33)
Here, ⟨·, ·⟩denotes the standard inner product in IRd2, with induced norm || · ||.
We will now have a closer look at the linear IAE (8.1.25) and describe its
solvability and the regularity of its solution.
Theorem 8.1.5 Let ν ≥0 and assume that
(a) K1l ∈Cν(D) for l = 1, 2;
(b) K2l ∈Cν+1(D) (l = 1, 2), and K22 satisﬁes the condition (8.1.30);
(c) q1 ∈Cν(I) and q2 ∈Cν+1(I), with q2(0) = 0.

Then the IAE (8.1.24),(8.1.25) possesses a unique solution x = (y, z)T on I,
with y, z ∈Cν(I).
The proof of the regularity of x can also be deduced from the following
representation theorem (which we state and prove, for ease of notation, for the
case V21 = 0).
Theorem 8.1.6 Assume that the hypotheses given in Theorem 8.1.5 hold with
ν ≥0. Then for K21(t, s) = 0 on D the (unique) solution of the linear IAE
(8.1.24),(8.1.25) is given by the representation

the matrix functions Q12, Q22 lie in Cν(D). (The proof will give an indication
of the connection between these functions and the given kernels Kkl.)
Proof If we denote by R11(t, s) and R22(t, s) the resolvent kernels associated
respectively with the kernel K11(t, s) in (8.1.24) and the kernel
H22(t, s) := −(K22(t, t))−1 ∂K22(t, s)

is rewritten as a standard second-kind VIE. Recall from Chapter 2 that these

equations (2.1.9) or (2.1.10). The solutions of the second-kind VIEs (8.1.31)
(with K21 = 0) and (8.1.24) are then given by

respectively, where g2(t) := −(K22(t, t))−1q′
2(t) and R22(t, s) denotes the re-

(note that, by assumption, q2(0) = 0). The representation (8.1.35) for z(t) now
readily follows, by setting κ22(t) := −(K22(t, t))−1.
The representation (8.1.34) for the solution component y(t) results by re-
placing z(s) by the right-hand side of (8.1.37), and by applying Dirichlet’s
formula and an integration by parts step. This representation also yields the
desired information on the regularity of the solution y of the IAE (8.1.24/25).
8.1.3 IDAEs with smooth kernels
In this section we will consider the semilinear Volterra ‘integro-differential-
algebraic’ equation (IDAE),
A(t)x′(t) + b(x(t), t) =

 t
0
k(t, s, x(s))ds,
t ∈I,
(8.1.38)
(cf. (8.1.4) and (8.1.23)), as well as its linear version described by
b(x, t) = B(t)x −q(t) and k(t, s, x) = K(t, s)x.
We write the corresponding linear semi-explicit IDAE as
y′(t) + B11(t)y(t) + B12(t)z(t) = q1(t) + (V11y)(t) + (V12z)(t),
(8.1.39)
0 = q2(t) + (V21y)(t) + (V22z)(t),
(8.1.40)
with B11, B12 and the integral operators Vkl as in (8.1.6/7) and (8.1.24/25),
and subject to the hypotheses stated earlier. We assume again that q2(0) = 0.
An interesting special case – the link between a DAE and a ‘full’ IDAE, so to
speak – is obtained when V11 = V12 = 0: we then have the coupling of an ODE
with a ﬁrst-kind VIE. If we are looking for a solution x(t) = (y(t), z(t))T to the
IDAE system (8.1.39),(8.1.40) satisfying an initial condition x0 = (y0, z0)T ,
we observe that these initial values are consistent if
K21(0, 0)y0 + K22(0, 0)z0 = −q′
2(0).

8.1 Basic theory of DAEs and IAEs
475
Deﬁnition 8.1.6 The semi-explicit IDAE (8.1.39/40) is said to be index-1
tractable if the ﬁrst-kind VIE corresponding to the Volterra operator V22 in
(8.1.40),
(V22w)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I,
(8.1.41)
is uniquely solvable in C(I) whenever g ∈C1(I) and g(0) = 0.
We will focus again on index-1 IDEAs, in analogy to DAEs in Section 8.1.1.
It follows from the resolvent theory of Section 3.1.1 and the analysis of the
previous section on the representation of solutions of IAEs that the solution
x(t) := (y(t), z(t))T of the IDAE (8.1.39),(8.1.40) can be expressed in a way
completely analogous to that of Theorem 8.1.6. We state this in Theorem 8.1.7
but leave the details of the proof to the reader.
Theorem 8.1.7 Assume that the matrix functions B11(·, ·), B12(·, ·) are in
Cν(I), with ν ≥0, and that q1, q2 and the kernels Kk,l (k,l = 1, 2) are subject
to the assumptions (a)–(c) of Theorem 8.1.5. Then for any set of consistent
initial values {y0, z0} the IDEA (8.1.39),(8.1.40) possesses a unique solution
x = (y, z)T , with y ∈Cν+1(I) and z ∈Cν(I), satisfying x(0) = (y0, z0)T .
This solution can be represented in the form
y(t) = r11(t, 0)y0 +

 t
0
r11(t, s)q1(s)ds
(8.1.42)
+ κ12(t)q2(t) +

 t
0
q12(t, s)q2(s)ds,
z(t) = κ21(t)q2(t) + κ22(t)q′
2(t) +

 t
0
q22(t, s)q2(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(8.1.43)
Here, r11 ∈Cν+1(D) denotes the matrix resolvent kernel corresponding to the
homogeneous data B11(·) and K11(·, ·) in (8.1.39), and the remaining functions
κ12, q12 and κ21, κ22, q22 inherit, respectively, the regularity of the data in
(8.1.39) and (8.1.40).
Proof We proceed along the lines of the proof of Theorem 8.1.6 for IAEs. The
argument regarding the solvability of the ﬁrst-kind equation (8.1.40) and the
representation of its solution z by (8.1.35) remains the same. If we view the
VIDE (8.1.40) as an equation for y, then we may use the classical resolvent
representation (see (8.1.46) below) to express y in terms of z: we know that
formally this representation is the same for both equations. Substitution of the
previously derived expression for z, and the adaptation of the techniques used
in the proof of Theorem 8.1.6 then readily lead to the result of the theorem.

476
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
Remark The form of the solution representation in Theorem 8.1.7 remains of
course valid for IDAEs of the special form
y′(t) + B11(t)y(t) + B12(t)z(t) = q1(t)
(8.1.44)
(V21y)(t) + (V22z)(t) = q2(t),
(8.1.45)
since the resolvent representation (3.1.4),
y(t) = r(t, 0)y0 +

 t
0
r(t, s)g(s)ds,
t ∈I,
(8.1.46)
with r(t, s) deﬁned by
∂r(t, s)
∂s
= −r(t, s)a(s) −

 t
s
r(t, v)K(v, s)dv,
(t, s) ∈D,
of the solution to
y′(t) = a(t)y(t) + g(t) +

 t
0
K(t, s)y(s)ds,
y(0) = y0,
is formally identical with the one for the ODE corresponding to K(t, s) ≡0.
Question Can we extend the notion of inherent regular ODE and properly
stated leading term, described in Section 8.1.1 (recall Lemma 8.1.1, its proof,
and Deﬁnition 8.1.4), to the linear version of the IDAE (8.1.38),
A(t)x′(t) + B(t)x(t) = q(t) + (Vx)(t),
t ∈I,
(8.1.47)
where we have set
(Vx)(t) :=

 t
0
K(t, s)x(s)ds,
with continuous matrix function K(·, ·) ∈L(IRd)? In other words, what is the
inherent regular VIDE of (8.1.38) or (8.1.47)?
Proceeding formally, starting from Lemma 8.1.1 (and omitting the argument
t in P(t), A1(t), B0(t)), we may rewrite (8.1.47) as
(Px)′ −P′Px + P A−1
1 B0Px = P A−1
1 [q(t) + (Vx)(t)],
(8.1.48)
Qx + Q A−1
1 B0Px = Q A−1
1 [q(t) + (Vx)(t)].
(8.1.49)
This observation clearly reveals the limitations of the previous framework:
the analogous decoupling analysis for IDAEs requires an inﬁnite-dimensional
(Hilbert or Banach space) setting, as has been pointed out in M¨arz (2002) and
Lamour, M¨arz and Tischendorf (2001). Compare also the remarks in Section
9.3.

8.1 Basic theory of DAEs and IAEs
477
8.1.4 IAEs and IDAEs with weakly singular kernels
Except for the regularity results in Theorems 8.1.5 and 8.1.7, the analysis of
Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 carries over to IAEs and IDAEs in which the Volterra
integral operators possess weakly singular kernels. In the linear case the deﬁ-
nition (8.1.26) is then replaced by
(Vα
klφ)(t) :=

 t
0
pα(t −s)Kkl(t, s)φ(s)ds,
t ∈I
(k,l = 1, 2),
with 0 < α ≤1. As in Chapter 6 the weakly singular factor pα is given
by pα(t) := t−α when 0 < α < 1, and by p1(t) := log(t). The continu-
ous matrix kernels Kkl(·, ·) (k,l = 1, 2) satisfy Kkk(·, ·) ∈L(IRdk), K12(·, ·) ∈
L(IRd2, IRd1), and K21(·, ·) ∈L(IRd1, IRd2), with Kkl(t, t) ̸= 0 on I.
Hence, the weakly singular analogue of the semi-explicit linear IAE
(8.1.24/25) reads
y(t) = q1(t) + (Vα
11y)(t) + (Vα
12z)(t),
(8.1.50)
0 = q2(t) + (Vα
21y)(t) + (Vα
22z)(t),
t ∈I.
(8.1.51)
We will always assume that q2(0) = 0, and we set again x(t) := (y(t), z(t))T .
In the nonlinear case corresponding to (8.1.27/28) the Volterra operators
have the Hammerstein forms

 t
0
pα(t −s)Kk(t, s)Gk(s, y(s), z(s))ds
(k = 1, 2),
with 0 < α ≤1, continuous kernels Kk not vanishing along t = s, and smooth
Gk as in (2.1.27) and (2.1.28). The corresponding weakly singular IAE is then
y(t) = q1(t) +

 t
0
pα(t −s)K1(t, s)G1(s, y(s), z(s))ds,
(8.1.52)
0 = q2(t) +

 t
0
pα(t −s)K2(t, s)G2(s, y(s), z(s))ds,
t ∈I. (8.1.53)
As in Section 8.1.2 we will again focus on index-1 IEAs.
Deﬁnition 8.1.7 The semi-explicit IAE system (8.1.50/51) is said to be index-1
tractable if the ﬁrst-kind VIE corresponding to the Volterra operator Vα
22,
(Vα
22w)(t) = g(t),
t ∈I,
(8.1.54)
is uniquely solvable in C(I) whenever g ∈C1(I) and g(0) = 0.
Index-1 tractability for the nonlinear system (8.1.52/53) is deﬁned analo-
gously, based on the unique solvability of (8.1.53) in C(I) with respect to z.
Conditions under which the ﬁrst-kind VIEs (8.1.51) and (8.1.53) possess
unique continuous solutions can be found in, or deduced from, Theorems 6.1.13

478
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
and 6.1.16. In the following we will restrict our analysis to values α ∈(0, 1);
its (rather straightforward) extension to logarithmic kernel singularities is left
to the reader.
The degree of regularity of y and z follows essentially from Theorems 6.1.11
and 6.1.14. To see this, assume for ease of exposition that Vα
21 = 0 in (8.1.51)
(compare Exercise 8.6.6 for the general case). If q2 ∈Cν+1(I), with q2(0) = 0,
and K22 ∈Cν+1(D) satisﬁes |K22(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 on I, then it follows from
Theorem 6.1.14 that the solution z of the ﬁrst-kind VIE (8.1.51) lies in the
H¨older space Cα(I) and possesses continuous derivatives up to order ν on
(0, T ].
Consider now (8.1.50): since

 t
0
(t −s)−αsαds = t1−α+α

 1
0
(1 −v)−αvαdv = B(1 −α, 1 + α)t,
the contribution of the term (Vα
12z)(t) is smooth: it is in Cν(I) (but see also the
Remark below). Hence, Theorem 6.1.11 tells us that the (unique) solution of
y(t) = f (t) + (Vα
11y)(t),
t ∈I,
with f (t) := q1(t) + (Vα
12z)(t), lies in C1−α(I) but has continuous derivatives
up to order ν on (0, T ].
We summarise these observations in
Theorem 8.1.8 Assume that 0 < α < 1, and let the given functions qk and
Kkl (k,l = 1, 2) in the index-1 IAE system (8.1.50/51) satisfy the hypotheses
stated in Theorem 8.1.5. If K21 ≡0, then the regularity of its solution x =
(y, z)T is described by
y ∈C1−α(I),
with
y ∈Cν(0, T ],
and
z ∈Cα(I),
with z ∈Cν(0, T ].
Remark SupposethattheVolterraintegraloperatorsdescribingtheIAEsystem
(8.1.50/51) are replaced respectively by Vα1
1l (0 < α1 < 1) (in (8.1.50)) and
Vα2
2l (0 < α2 < 1) (in (8.1.51)). Let again K21 ≡0. Since z ∈Cα2(I), it follows
from the analysis preceding Theorem 8.1.8 that

 t
0
(t −s)−α1sα2ds = B(1 −α1, 1 + α2)t1−α1+α2.
Hence, according to Theorem 6.1.11, we have y ∈Cα2(I), regardless of the
value of α1.

8.2 Collocation for DAEs: a brief review
479
A similar regularity result is true for the semi-explicit IDAE system
y′(t) + B11(t)y(t) + B12(t)z(t) = q1(t) + (Vα
11y)(t) + (Vα
12z)(t), (8.1.55)
0 = q2(t) + (Vα
21y)(t) + (Vα
22z)(t), (8.1.56)
with B11, B12 and the integral operators Vα
kl as in (8.1.6) and (8.1.50/51), re-
spectively, and subject to the hypotheses stated earlier. We assume again that
q2(0) = 0 and that the tractability index of (8.1.55/56) equals one.
Theorem 8.1.9 Let 0 < α < 1 and assume that the given functions in
(8.1.55/56) satisfy the assumptions stated in Theorem 8.1.7. If Vα
21 = 0, then the
regularity of the solution x = (y, z)T to the IDAE system (8.1.55/56) is given by
y ∈C1,1−α(I),
with
y ∈Cν+1(0, T ],
and
z ∈Cα(I),
with z ∈Cν(0, T ].
An interesting special case corresponds to Vα
11 = Vα
12 = 0: we then have the
coupling of an ODE with a weakly singular ﬁrst-kind VIE.
Corollary 8.1.10 Let 0 < α < 1. If K1l ≡0 (l = 1, 2) and K21 ≡0 in
(8.1.55/56), then z ∈Cα(I), with z ∈Cν(0, T ], and y ∈C1,α(I), with y ∈
Cν+1(0, T ].
The proofs of the above regularity results are a direct consequence of Theorems
6.1.14 and Theorem 7.1.4. Details are left to the reader (who should also study
Exercise 8.9.2(ii) to obtain analogous results for more general IDAE systems).
8.2 Collocation for DAEs: a brief review
8.2.1 The collocation equations for index-1 problems
Let x(t) := (y(t), z(t))T denote the solution of the semi-explicit index-1 DAE
y′(t) = F(t, y(t), z(t)),
(8.2.1)
0 = G(t, y(t), z(t)),
t ∈I := [0, T ],
(8.2.2)
with consistent initial values {y0, z0}. Assume that it is approximated by the
collocation solution xh(t) := (uh(t), vh(t) T ), where uh, vh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) are de-
termined by the collocation equations
u′
h(t) = F(t, uh(t), vh(t)),
t ∈Xh,
(8.2.3)
0 = G(t, uh(t), vh(t)),
t ∈Xh,
(8.2.4)
and the initial conditions uh(0) = y0, vh(0) = z0.

480
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
Let
Xh := {tn,i := tn + cihn : 0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}
be the set of the collocation points. In analogy to Chapter 1, the computa-
tional form of the collocation equations (8.2.3),(8.2.4) will be based on the
local Lagrange representations of uh and vh:
uh(tn + shn) = yn + hn

(8.2.5)
vh(tn + shn) = zn + hn

s ∈[0, 1],
(8.2.6)
where yn := uh(tn), zn := vh(tn), Yn, j := u′
h(tn,i), Zn, j := vh(tn,i). Thus, for
t = tn,i the collocation equations become the stage equations for the resulting
continuous m-stage implicit Runge–Kutta method for the given semi-explicit
DAE, namely
Yn,i = F(tn,i, yn + hn

(8.2.8)
(i = 1, . . . , m), with ai, j := β j(ci).
Since classical Runge–Kutta methods and collocation methods for DAEs are
well understood (detailed treatments, also for DAES with index 2 and higher,
can be found in the books by Griepentrog and M¨arz (1986), Brenan, Campbell
and Petzold (1996), Hairer, Lubich and Roche (1989), Strehmel and Weiner
(1992) (index-1 DAEs), and Hairer and Wanner (1996); see also Ascher and
Petzold (1991) and Jay (1993)), we will only state a typical (super-) conver-
gence result. Additional convergence results will be given in Section 8.4 for
IDAEs (see in particular Theorem 8.4.2) of which our DAEs are particular
cases.
Theorem 8.2.1 Let xh = (uh, vh)T be the collocation solution to the semi-
explicit DAE (8.2.1),(8.2.2), with uh and vh in S(0)
m (Ih). Deﬁne, as in Theorem
2.4.2,

If the given functions are sufﬁciently regular, and such that (8.2.1),(8.2.2) is an
index-1 DAE, the following is true:

Remarks
1. The the eigenvalue ρm (recall the proof of Theorem 2.4.2) is closely related
to the stability function R(z) associated with the (collocation-based) implicit
Runge–Kutta method using as abscissas the collocation parameters {ci} with
c1 > 0 (see, e.g. Dekker and Verwer (1984) or Hairer and Wanner (1996)):
it coincides with R(∞). The reader may also wish to consult Kauthen and
Brunner (1997) for details on this connection.
2. As Ascher (1989) has shown, the collocation approximation vh to the alge-
braic component z of x could also have been sought in S(−1)
m−1(Ih).
8.2.2 Collocation for semi-explicit index-2 DAEs
We will brieﬂy illustrate, mainly for the sake of comparison, the collocation
equations for the semi-explicit index-2 DAE
y′(t) = F(t, y(t), z(t)),
0 = G(t, y(t)),
t ∈I,
where F and G are smooth and G y is non-singular. The collocation approxima-
tions uh and vh in S(0)
m (Ih) to y and z are deﬁned by their local representations

Detailed analyses of the convergence properties of Runge–Kutta methods
for index-2 DAEs can be found in, e.g. Griepentrog and M¨arz (1986), Petzold
(1986) and, especially, in M¨arz and Rodr´ıguez-Santiesteban (2002). Conver-
gence results for piecewise polynomial collocation methods (and corresponding
implicitRunge–Kuttamethods)appliedtoindex-2DAEsarediscussedinHairer
and Wanner (1996, pp. 498–501); a summary of local superconvergence results
is given on p. 504. Ascher and Petzold (1991) introduced projected colloca-
tion methods and studied their properties; see also Lubich (1991) and M¨arz
(1996) for an in-depth analysis and wider prespective of projected collocation
methods.
8.2.3 Numerically properly formulated DAEs
The above (superconvergence order) results for index-1 DAEs do not neces-
sarily imply that the collocation solution possesses the correct dynamics as
t →∞(and h > 0 ﬁxed). This fact is closely connected with the notion of
a properly formulated DAE described in Section 8.1.1. We will illustrate this
by analysing the collocation in the space S(0)
1 (Ih) and with c1 = 1 for a simple
index-1 DAE: while the resulting continuous implicit Euler method shows the
familiar unconditional asymptotic behaviour when the DAE has constant coef-
ﬁcients, it is no longer asymptotically stable for any stepsize h > 0 in the case
of variable coefﬁcients. This deﬁciency can be rectiﬁed if the DAE is rewritten
so that its leading terms are well matched, as described at the end of Section
8.1.1 (Deﬁnition 8.1.4).
We use the following linear DAE (see also Gear and Petzold (1984), M¨arz
(1996),M¨arzandRodr´ıguez-Santiesteban(2002))toshowthateveninanindex–
1 DAE a usually ‘foolproof’ collocation method (like the continuous implicit
Euler method) may not reﬂect the asymptotic behaviour of the exact solution
unconditionally for any stepsize h > 0.

where δ, σ ∈IR, with δ ̸= 1, σ ̸= 0. It is easy to see that under these assump-
tions the DAE has (tractability) index one. Note also that for δ = 0 the DAE has
constant coefﬁcients. For q(t) ≡0 the solution x(t) = (y(t), z(t))T is given by
z(t) = exp((δ −σ)t)z0,
y(t) = 1 −δt
δ −1 z(t).
(Note that the initial values x(0) = x0 = (y0, z0)T are consistent if (δ −1)y0 −
z0 = 0, or y0 = z0/(δ −1).) It thus follows that
lim
t→∞z(t) = lim
t→∞y(t) = 0
whenever δ < σ.
Assume now that we solve (8.2.10) by collocation in S(0)
1 (Ih), with uniform
mesh Ih and 0 < c1 ≤1. We use the local representations
uh(tn + sh) = yn + shYn,1,
vh(tn + sh) = zn + shZn,1
(v ∈[0, 1]),
where yn := uh(tn), zn := vh(tn), Yn,1 := u′

It reveals the following:
r For δ = 0 (DAE with constant coefﬁcients) and σ < 0 we see that

for any stepsize h > 0. This reﬂects the ‘typical’ unconditional asymptotic
stability of the implicit Euler method.

484
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
r For δ ̸= 0 (DAE with variable coefﬁcients) the situation is very different: the
approximation zn to the algebraic component z(t) at t = tn does not remain
bounded for every h > 0. More precisely, xh is asymptotically stable only
under the stepsize restriction
|1 + δh| < |1 + σh|.
This shows that, in contrast to ODEs (‘DAEs are not ODEs’ – Petzold (1984))
DAE test equations with constant coefﬁcients do not properly model the
general qualitative behaviour of solutions to variable coefﬁcient DAEs, even
if they are linear: variable coefﬁcients in DAEs have a much stronger effect
on the numerical solution than in ODEs.
This phenomenon is even more pronounced in DAEs of higher index.
Illuminating examples (and additional references) can be found in M¨arz
(1992) and Schulz (2003).
However, choosing ¯A := diag (1, 0), D = A, we obtain ¯B := B −¯AD (cf.
(8.1.22)), and the use of the continuous implicit Euler method to the decoupled
DAE
¯A(D(t)x(t))′ + ¯B(t)x(t) = 0,
t ≥0,
(8.2.11)
with δ ̸= 0, δ < σ, yields an approximation that is asymptotically stable for
any stepsize h > 0. Its components are given by

We leave the proof of this statement to the reader.

In order to describe the key ideas without having to resort to complex notation
involving Kronecker products of matrices and vectors (for example in the linear

In order to formulate the resulting systems of linear algebraic equations for
the vector Un := (Un,1, . . . , Un,m)T and Vn := (Vn,1, . . . , Vn,m)T we adapt the
notation introduced in Section 2.2.2 and deﬁne the matrices

and
G(k)
n := (F(k)

It is clear that due to our assumptions on the kernels Kkl the left-hand side
(block-) matrix is non-singular for all sufﬁciently small hn: there exists a ¯h > 0
so that the linear algebraic system (8.3.12) has a unique solution Un, Vn for n =
0, 1, . . . , N −1 whenever Ih is a mesh with h ∈(0, ¯h). This is a consequence
of the structure of the matrix block Im −hn B(1,1)
n
(cf. Theorem 2.2.1) and the
form of B(2,2)
n
(condition (8.2.20) on K22(t, s) and Theorem 2.4.1).
8.3.2 Convergence results
Once we know the collocation solution components uh and vh we can compute
the iterated collocation solution uit
h at t = tn + vhn (v ∈[0, 1]) via (8.3.6).
However, as we shall see below (Theorem 8.3.2) this will now not have any
advantage (except for generating a continuous approximation on I). Since the
given system of IAEs contains a ﬁrst-kind Volterra integral equation, the con-
vergence properties of the collocation solution wh will be governed by the
(necessary and sufﬁcient) conditions on the {ci} given in Theorem 2.4.2. The
‘coupling’ of VIEs of the second and ﬁrst kind will also mean that collocation
at the Gauss points (for which we have cm < 1) will no longer lead to global
superconvergence (of order m + 1) on I, or to local superconvergence (of order
2m) on Ih in the iterated collocation solution uit
h .
We start with the following global convergence result (due to Kauthen
(2001)).

8.3 Collocation for IAEs with smooth kernels
487
Theorem 8.3.1 Let the assumptions of Theorem 8.1.5 hold with ν ≥m, and
suppose that Ih is a mesh with h ∈(0, ¯h). Then the following statements are
true for the collocation solution xh, with uh, vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih):
(i) For every choice of the {ci} with 0 < c1 < . . . < cm = 1 we have
||y −uh||∞≤C1hm,
||z −vh||∞≤C2hm.
(ii) If 0 < c1 < . . . < cm < 1, the attainable order of convergence is given by
||y −uh||∞≤C1hm,
||z −vh||∞≤C2
 hm
if ρm ∈[−1, 1),
hm−1
if ρ = 1.
Here,
ρm := (−1)m
m

i=1
1 −ci
ci
.
Proof The proof of this result combines elements of the proofs for Theorems
2.2.3 and 2.4.2. For cm = 1 the assertion that both uh and vh converge with
the same order p = m is easily veriﬁed. In the case where cm < 1 we have to
resort to the differencing procedure (used in the proof of Theorem 2.4.2) for the
collocation equation corresponding to the ﬁrst-kind VIE (8.2.3). The reader is
referred to Kauthen (2001, pp. 1509–1511) for the details.
We now turn to the question on the attainable orders of (global and local)
superconvergence for uh and vh. As in Section 2.2, let
eh(tn + vhn) :=
m

j=1
L j(v)En, j + hm
n R(1)
m,n(v),
v ∈(0, 1],
and
ϵh(tn + vhn) :=
m

j=1
L j(v)En, j + R(2)
m,n(v) v ∈(0, 1],
with En, j := eh(tn, j) and En,i := ϵh(tn, j), be the local representations of the
collocation errors eh := y −uh and ϵh := z −vh on σn. These errors solve the
IAE system
eh(t) = δh(t) + (V11eh)(t) + (V12ϵh)(t),
(8.3.13)
0 = dh(t) + (V21eh)(t) + (V22ϵh)(t),
t ∈I,
(8.3.14)
where the defects δh and dh vanish at all points of Xh. Since the above system
has the same structure as (8.1.39) and (8.1.40), with eh, ϵh, δh and dh replacing

488
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
y, z, f and g, Theorem 8.1.6 tells us that the solution of the system of IAEs
for the errors has the representation
eh(t) = δh(t) +

 t

h(t) +

 t
0
Q22(t, s)dh(s)ds,
t ∈I. (8.3.16)
Moreover, we have eit
h := y −uit
h = eh −δh. Setting t = tn (n = 1, . . . , N) we
are led to two observations: ﬁrstly, the expression for eh(tn) reduces to a sum of
integrals (containing the defects δh and dh in their integrands) if, and only if, tn ∈
Xh, that is, if cm = 1. In this case, the well-known quadrature argument we have
employed in the proofs of superconvergence results for second-kind VIEs can
againbeapplied:theyshowthatifthe{ci}aretheRadauIIpointstheneh exhibits
O(h2m−1)-convergence on Ih \ {0}. We also see that local superconvergence in
eit
h of order 2m is no longer possible when the Gauss points are used, due to the
presence of the term κ12(t)dh(t) in (8.3.15).
A similar reason prevents the occurrence of local superconvergence in ϵh(tn).
Here, (8.2.3) contains, in addition to κ21(tn) (which vanishes when cm = 1) the
term κ22(tn)d′
h(tn): it would only be zero in the case of Hermite-type collocation
at cm = 1. This is of course not surprising after what we have learned in Section
2.4.2.
We summarise the results obtained from these observations in
Theorem 8.3.2 Assume:
(a) f ∈Cν(I), K1l ∈Cν(D) (l = 1, 2).
(b) g ∈Cν+1(I), g(0) = 0, and K2l ∈Cν+1(D), with |K22(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 for
t ∈I.
(c) uh ∈S(−0)
m−1(Ih) and vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) are the collocation solutions to the IAE
(8.3.1),(8.3.2) determined by (8.3.4) and (8.3.5).
If the collocation points Xh correspond to the Radau II {ci} points (where
cm = 1) and if ν ≥2m −1, then
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤C1h2m−1,
(8.3.17)
max
t∈Ih\{0} |z(t) −vh(t)| ≤C2hm.
(8.3.18)

8.4 Collocation for IDAEs with smooth kernels
489
If collocation is based on the Gauss points, then the (local) order of uit
h on Ih
cannot in general exceed
max
t∈Xh\{0} |y(t) −uit
h (t)| ≤C1hm,
even if ν ≥2m. The order of vh depends on the value of ρm: if ρm ∈[−1, 0)
then we obtain O(hm)-convergence, while for ρm = 1 the order reduces to
p = m −1.
8.4 Collocation for IDAEs with smooth kernels
8.4.1 The collocation equations for Volterra IDAEs
Recall the IDAE system given by (8.1.39) and (8.1.40):
y′(t) + B11(t)y(t) + B12(t)z(t) = q1(t) + (V11y)(t) + (V12z)(t), (8.4.1)
0 = q2(t) + (V21y)(t) + (V22z)(t).
(8.4.2)
We will also consider the corresponding nonlinear (Volterra–Hammerstein)
version,
y′(t) = F(y(t), z(t)) +

 t
0
K1(t, s)G1(s, y(s), z(s))ds,
(8.4.3)
0 = q2(t) +

 t
0
K2(t, s)G2(s, y(s), z(s))ds,
t ∈I.
(8.4.4)
It is natural to approximate their solutions x(t) = (y(t), z(t))T by the collo-
cation solution xh(t) = (uh(t), vh(t))T with uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) and vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih).
Since, as we know from Section 2.2.1, the dimensions of these two linear spaces
differ only by one, we can use the set
Xh := {tn,i := tn + cihn : 0 < c1 < . . . < cm ≤1 (0 ≤n ≤N −1)}
as collocation points in the collocation equations for both VIEs in (8.4.1/2) and
(8.4.3/4). For the linear IDAE system (8.4.1/2) these equations read
u′
h(t) + B11(t)uh(t) + B12(t)vh(t) = q1(t) + (V11uh)(t) + (V12vh)(t), (8.4.5)
0 = q2(t) + (V21uh)(t) + (V22vh)(t), (8.4.6)
where t ∈Xh.
As in Section 8.3.1 we will again assume that d1 = d2 = 1 in (8.4.1/2);
this permits a more transparent exposition of the main ideas underlying the
convergence analysis. The reader is again invited to derive the more general
analysis for arbitrary d1 and d2, employing the familiar Kronecker product

Observe the similarity with the analogous system (8.3.12) for IAEs. The mean-

Thanks to the assumed continuity of the kernels Kkl on D there exists again
an ¯h > 0 so that the (block-) matrix describing the left-hand side of (8.4.11)
is invertible for all h ∈(0, ¯h). Thus, for meshes whose diameters satisfy this
condition, the algebraic systems (8.4.11) and the local representations (8.4.7/8)
deﬁne a unique collocation solution xh to the IDAE (8.4.1/2).
8.4.2 Convergence results
Theorems 8.2.1 and 8.3.2 give an indication of what the analogous results on
the optimal global and local orders of (super-) convergence for the collocation
solutions deﬁned by (8.4.5) and (8.4.6) will look like for IDAEs, since the
orders will again be governed by the presence of a ﬁrst-kind VIE. We ﬁrst
state, without proof, the result on the attainable order of global convergence on
I. A closely related result for implicit Runge–Kutta methods was derived by
Kauthen (1993).
Theorem 8.4.1 Assume that
(a) B11, B12, q1 ∈Cm(I), and q2 ∈Cm+1(I), with q2(0) = 0;
(b) K1l ∈Cm(D) (l = 1, 2);
(c) K2l ∈Cm+1(D), with |K22(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 on I;

8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
(d) xh = (uh, vh)T , with uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) and vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), is the collocation
solution deﬁned by (8.4.7/8) and (8.4.11).
If the collocation points Xh correspond to any {ci} with 0 < c1 < . . . < cm = 1,
then xh induces the estimate
||y −uh||∞≤C1hm,
||z −vh||∞≤C2hm.
For cm < 1 the second of the above estimates does not necessarily remain true:
we now have
||y −uh||∞≤C1hm,
||z −vh||∞≤C2
 hm
if −1 ≤ρm < 1,
hm−1
if ρm = 1.
As in Theorem 8.2.1, ρm (= R(∞)) is given by
ρm := (−1)m
m

i=1
1 −ci

.
An order reduction in the optimal order of local superconvergence is, after
Theorem 8.2.1 (index-1 DAEs), Theorem 8.3.2 (index-1 IAEs) and the above
result, no longer surprising: collocation at the Gauss points does not lead to
p∗= 2m for uh on Ih, and the optimal order is given by 2m −1.
Theorem 8.4.2 Let the assumptions of Theorem 8.4.1 hold, but with m in the
regularity hypotheses replaced by ν ≥2m −1. If the collocation points Xh are
those corresponding to the Radau II points {ci}, we obtain the estimates
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤C1h2m−1,
(8.4.12)
max
t∈Ih\{0} |z(t) −vh(t)| ≤C2hm.
(8.4.13)
If collocation is at the Gauss points, then the local order of uh coincides with
the global one: we only attain
max
t∈Ih\{0} |y(t) −uh(t)| ≤C1hm.
The second estimate (8.4.13) remains valid if m is odd; for even values of m it
becomes
max
t∈Ih\{0} |z(t) −vh(t)| ≤C2hm−1.
Proof Setting again eh := y −uh and ϵh := z −vh, and denoting the defects
induced by collocation by δh and dh, respectively, we see that the errors solve
e′
h(t) = B11(t)eh(t) + B12(t)ϵh(t) + δh(t) + (V11eh)(t) + (V12ϵh)(t),
t ∈I,
0 = dh(t) + (V21eh)(t) + (V22ϵh)(t),
t ∈I,

8.5 IAEs and IDAEs with weakly singular kernels
493
with eh(0) = 0. Thus, the key to the above order results is contained in Theorem
8.1.7 and the representation of the collocation errors eh and ϵh. We readily obtain
– along the lines of the proof of Theorem 8.3.2 – the error representations
eh(t) = r11(t, 0)eh(0) +

 t

and
ϵh(t) = κ21(t)dh(t) + κ22(t)d′
h(t) +

 t
0
q22(t, s)dh(s)ds,
t ∈I.
(8.4.15)
Setting t = tn (1 ≤n ≤N) and employing once more the familiar quadrature
arguments, the assertions in Theorem 8.4.2 follow: we observe that cm = 1
implies that δh(tn) = dh(tn) = 0.
If the {ci} are the Gauss points, then dh(tn) ̸= 0 (in fact, this term is O(hm)).
Thus, the local order on Ih cannot exceed the global order, p = m, of uh.
Corollary 8.4.3 The optimal order results of Theorem 8.4.2 hold for the semi-
explicit index-1 system given by
y′(t) = F(t, y(t), z(t)),

8.5.1 Collocation for weakly singular IAEs
Assume that the solution x = (y, z)T of the linear semi-explicit IAE system
(8.1.50/51) is approximated by the collocation solution xh = (uh, vh)T , as al-
ready described in Section 8.3.1 for α = 0. The collocation equations deﬁning
uh, vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) are now
uh(t) = q1(t) + (Vα
11uh)(t) + (Vα
12vh)(t),
t ∈Xh,
(8.5.1)
0 = q2(t) + (Vα
21uh)(t) + (Vα
22vh)(t),
t ∈Xh.
(8.5.2)
The iterated collocation solution uit
h is then found from
uit
h (t) := q1(t) + (Vα
11uh)(t) + (Vα
12vh)(t),
t ∈I.
(8.5.3)
The computational forms of these three equations are readily derived from
(6.2.13), (6.3.4), and (6.2.16), using again the familiar local Lagrange

(k,l = 1, 2).
Due to our assumptions on the kernels Kkl, the existence of a unique solution
for these linear algebraic systems follows along standard arguments, and is true
for all meshes Ih with h ∈(0, ¯h), for some ¯h = ¯h(α) > 0.
The convergence analysis for the collocation solution xh remains open. This
is due, as we recall from Section 6.3.3, to the fact that for m > 1 we do not
yet know necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on the collocation parameters {ci}
ensuring the uniform convergence of vh to z. However, assuming that we have
set {ci} for which convergence holds, then we can say more about the attainable
order of convergence of uh and vh, since we have already derived, in Theorem
8.1.8, results on the regularity of solution components y and z.
Suppose that Ih is a graded mesh of the form
Ih := {tn := (n/N)rT : n = 0, 1, . . . , N (r = r(α) ≥1)},
and set
r I :=
m
1 −α ,
r I I := m
α
(0 < α < 1).
We remember from Chapter 6 that r I and r I I are respectively the optimal
grading exponents for weakly singular VIEs of the second and ﬁrst kind

8.5 IAEs and IDAEs with weakly singular kernels
495
(cf. Theorems 6.2.9 and 6.3.2). For α = 1/2 we have r I = r I I. If α ̸= 1/2,
‘over-grading’ still yields optimal convergence orders. Hence, the following
result is now obvious.
Theorem 8.5.1 Assume that the given functions describing the IAE system
(8.1.50/51) with 0 < α < 1 are subject to the hypotheses in Theorem 8.1.5,
where ν ≥m and K21 ≡0. Set r∗:= max{r I, r I I}, and let the collocation
parameters {ci} be such that the collocation solution vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to weakly
singular ﬁrst-kind VIEs is uniformly convergent on I. Then the collocation solu-
tion xh := (uh, vh)T determined by the collocation equations (8.5.1/2) satisﬁes
||y −uh||∞≤C1hm,
||z −vh||∞≤C2hm,
for any graded mesh Ih with grading exponent r = r∗and sufﬁciently large N.
Here we have set again h := T/N.
Remark The attainable order in the iterated collocation solution uit
h given by
(8.5.3) is not yet understood, since we do not know if collocation parameters
satisfying the orthogonality condition J0 = 0 (recall assumption (c) in Theorem
6.2.13) lead to convergent collocation solutions for weakly singular VIEs of
the ﬁrst kind.
8.5.2 Collocation for weakly singular IDAEs
The results in the previous section readily suggest that an optimal convergence
result similar to that in Theorem 8.5.1 will hold for the semilinear IDAE system
y′(t) + B11(t)y(t) + B12(t)z(t) = q1(t) + (Vα
11y)(t) + (Vα
12z)(t),
(8.5.6)
0 = q2(t) + (Vα
21y)(t) + (Vα
22z)(t),
(8.5.7)
again with the proviso that the collocation parameters are feasible in the sense
of that theorem. Thus, assume that the solution of (8.5.4/5) is approximated
in S(0)
m (Ih) and S(−1)
m−1(Ih), respectively. According to Section 8.4.1 the resulting
collocation equations are
u′
h(t) + B11(t)uh(t) + B12(t)vh(t) = q1(t) + (Vα
11uh)(t) + (Vα

(i = 1, . . . , m; k = 1, 2).
Theorem 8.5.2 Let 0 < α < 1 and assume that the given functions describing
the IDAE system (8.5.4/5) are subject to the hypotheses in Theorem 8.1.7,
with ν ≥m and K21 ≡0. Set r∗:= m/α, and let the collocation parameters
{ci} be such that the collocation solution vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to weakly singular
ﬁrst-kind VIEs is uniformly convergent on I. Then the collocation solution
xh := (uh, vh)T determined by the collocation equations (8.5.1/2) satisﬁes
||y −uh||∞≤C1hm,
||z −vh||∞≤C2hm,
for any graded mesh Ih with grading exponent r = r∗and sufﬁciently large N.
Here we have set again h := T/N.
Proof Under the assumption that the chosen collocation parameters {ci} yield
uniform convergence of collocation solutions in S(−1)
m−1(Ih) to weakly singular
VIEs of the ﬁrst kind, we can resort to Section 7.2.3 (see Remark 2 following
the proof of Theorem 7.2.3) and to Theorem 6.3.2, to deduce that – in complete
analogy to Theorem 8.5.1 – the optimal order of global convergence for uh and

497
vh is attained if the grading exponent r∗is given by
r∗:= max{(m + 1 −α)/(2 −α), m/α} = m/α
(0 < α < 1).
We conclude this section by brieﬂy looking at a simple special case of the
index-1 IDAE system (8.5.4), namely
y′(t) + B11(t)y(t) + B12(t)z(t) = q1(t),
(8.5.13)
(Vα
22z)(t) + q2(t) = 0,
t ∈I.
(8.5.14)
Here, the kernel K22 in Vα
22 is assumed to satisfy the condition (c) in Theorem
8.4.1: K22 ∈Cm+1(D), with |K22(t, t)| ≥k0 > 0 on I. While the ﬁrst part of
this IDAE system now does not contain a Volterra operator with weakly singular
kernel, the non-smooth contribution has its origin solely in the second equation:
under the standard assumptions on q2 and K22 we know that its solution lies in
Cα(I) and is smooth on (0, T ]. Hence, according to Theorem 7.1.1 and Exercise
7.7.5, the general solution of the VIDE (8.5.6) lies in the H¨older space C1,α(I).
This insight allows us to establish the attainable orders of uh and vh on suitably
graded meshes.
Theorem 8.5.3 Let the setting described in Theorem 8.5.2 hold. If the mesh Ih
is graded, with grading exponentr = r I I := m/α, then the collocation solution
xh = (uh, vh)T to (8.5.6/7), with uh ∈S(0)
m (Ih) and vh ∈S(−1)
m−1(Ih), exhibits the
global orders given by
||y −uh||∞≤C1hm,
||z −vh||∞≤C2hm,
with constants Ck = Ck(r) depending on α but not on N.

8.1: Basic theory of DAEs and IAEs
The most comprehensive and up-to-date survey of the theory and numerical
analysis of DAEs is Rabier and Rheinboldt (2002). The books by Griepen-
trog and M¨arz (1986), Brenan, Campbell and Petzold (1996) (ﬁrst published

500
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
in 1989), Hairer, Lubich and Roche (1989), and Hairer and Wanner (1996)
(Chapters VI and VII) all contain good introductions to, and descriptions of,
the respective state of the art in numerical DAEs and their applications. See, in
addition, the survey papers by M¨arz (1985, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1998), the book
by Boyarintsev and Chystyakov (1998) (who also consider the IAE forms of
DAE systems), and the report by Schulz (2003). Chapter 6 of Strehmel and
Weiner (1992) treats numerical methods for index-1 DAEs.
The geometry of DAEs is studied in Rheinboldt (1984) and Rabier and
Rheinboldt (1994, 2002).
Applications of DAEs, IAEs and IDAEs:
The survey by Rabier and Rheinboldt (2002, pp. 197–218) contains a wide-
ranging description of DAEs arising in applications, from network problems
and constrained rigid-body systems to control problems. Good sources on appli-
cations are also Ascher (1989), Brenan, Campbell and Petzold (1996), Winkler
(2003), and Tischendorf (2001). Consult also the many references in M¨arz
(2001).
‘Mixed’ systems of IAEs consisting of second- and ﬁrst-kind VIEs arise in
many mathematical modelling processes; we mention memory kernel identiﬁ-
cation problems in heat conduction and viscoelasticity (v. Wolfersdorf (1994),
Janno and v. Wolfersdorf (1997a, 1997b) and Kiss (1999)), evolution of a chem-
ical reaction within a small cell (Jumarhon, Lamb, McKee and Tang (1996) and
references), and Kirchhoff’s laws (Doleˇzal (1960); this appears to be the ﬁrst
source (except for a similar paper, in Czech, of 1959 by the same author) of a
Volterra IDAE). (The author is grateful to Roswitha M¨arz for pointing out this
paper to him.)
8.2: Collocation for DAEs
Hairer, Lubich and Roche (1989) present numerous superconvergence results
for Runge–Kutta solutions to DAEs; see also Petzold (1986), M¨arz (1989),
Lopez(1990),Hanke,IzquierdoMacanaandM¨arz(1998),M¨arzandRodr´ıguez-
Santiesteban (2002), and Rabier and Rheinboldt (2002, pp. 415–424). Two-step
Runge–Kutta methods for index-1 DAEs are presented in Y. Chen (1995).
Collocation methods for higher-index DAEs are studied in Hairer, Lubich
and Roche (1989), Jay (1993) and Hairer and Wanner (1996, Ch. VII). Ascher
and Petzold (1991) introduced projected collocation methods for DAEs, to
avoid ‘drift-off’ of the approximate solution; these methods are studied further
in Lubich (1991), Hairer and Wanner (1996, pp. 512–515) and, especially, in
M¨arz (1996). See also Rabier and Rheinboldt (2002, pp. 426–428).
Boundary-value problems for DAEs have also received considerable atten-
tion, not least owing to their importance in applications. We refer the reader to

Readers interested in the numerical analysis of partial DAEs should consult
the paper by Lucht, Strehmel and Eichler-Liebenow (1999) and its references.
M¨arz (2001) and Lamour, M¨arz and Tischendorf (2001) have shown that
partial DAEs and IDAEs can be re-formulated as abstract DAEs in an inﬁnite-
dimensional (Hilbert space) setting. This insight, combined with the work of
M¨arz and her collaborators (see, e.g. the papers by M¨arz (1992, 2002a, 2002b),
Higueras and M¨arz (2000), Higueras, M¨arz and Tischendorf (2001a, 2001b),
and Balla and M¨arz (2002)) appears to provide a powerful tool for the qualitative
and quantitative analysis of numerical solutions to partial DAEs and IDAEs.
DAEs with delay arguments
Ascher and Petzold (1995) and Hauber (1997) studied the convergence proper-
ties of Runge–Kutta and piecewise polynomial collocation solutions for DAEs
with constant and (more general) non-vanishing delays. It would be interesting
to investigate these problems within the general framework of abstract DAEs,
as described in M¨arz (2001). The alternative approach by Bellen and Maset
(1999) and Maset (1999, 2002) of recasting a DDE as a Cauchy problem for an
abstract ODE may also be worth investigating.
Except for our (super-) convergence results for index-1 IAEs and IDAEs with
delay arguments, the general study of the quantitative (and qualitative) proper-
ties of collocation solutions to such problems with higher index, especially the
extension of the theory of M¨arz and her collaborators, has not yet been done.
8.3: Collocation for IAEs with smooth kernels
The results on local superconvergence of piecewise polynomial collocation
solutions to index-1 Volterra IAEs are due to Kauthen (2001). Compare also
Kauthen (1997b) for a related analysis. The analogous analysis for IAEs of
tractability index 2 and higher is waiting to be carried out.
8.4: Collocation for IDAEs with smooth kernels
To the best of my knowledge, this is the ﬁrst treatment of the question of global
and local superconvergence of piecewise polynomial collocation solutions for
index-1 IDAEs. The corresponding analysis for IDAEs with index-2 or higher
is open.
Kauthen (1993) provided the ﬁrst study of the convergence properties of
implicit Runge–Kutta methods of Pouzet-type for IDAEs. These methods can
be viewed as fully discretised collocation methods.
8.5: IDAEs with weakly singular kernels
As we have mentioned, the numerical analysis of IAEs and IDAEs with weakly
singular kernels is largely incomplete, because it hinges on the open problem

502
8 Outlook: integral-algebraic equations and beyond
regarding the sets of collocation parameters {ci} for which the collocation so-
lution in S(−1)
m−1(Ih) or S(0)
m (Ih) for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with integrable kernel singu-
larities is uniformly convergent.
The paper by Favini, Lorenzi and Tanabe (2002) deals with the analysis of
IDAEs of the form
[Mu′(t)]′ + Lu(t) =

 t
0
k(t −s)L1u(s)ds + f (t),
where L, L1, M are closed linear operators in a Banach space, with L−1
bounded and M not necessarily invertible. The kernel k(t −s) is either weakly
singular or non-smooth (with some unbounded derivative when t = s). The
numerical analysis of problems of this type appears to be open, too.
Singularly perturbed Volterra equations
Due to limitations of space we can only point to some recent advances in the
theory and the numerical analysis of singularly perturbed Volterra equations;
the comprehensive survey paper by Kauthen (1997a) gives a good idea about
the ‘state of the art’ and has an extensive list of references also on applications.
In addition, compare Kauthen (1995) and Bijura (2002a, 2002b, 2003).
The analysis regarding the attainable order of convergence in collocation
solutions for singularly perturbed VEs possessing weakly singular kernels,
εy(t) = g(t) + (Vαy)(t),
(8.7.1)
and
εy(r)(t) = f (t, y(t)) + (Vαy)(t),
(r = 1, 2),
(8.7.2)
with 0 < ε ≪1, 0 < α ≤1, and with Vα as in Chapters 6 and 7, is essentially
open. This is due to the fact that (i) we do not yet know under what conditions
on the collocation parameters {ci} the collocation solutions for the limiting
ﬁrst-kind VIEs corresponding to ε = 0 in (8.10.1) and (8.10.2) are convergent;
and (ii) for α ̸= 1/2 the optimal grading exponent have different values (recall
Theorems 6.2.9, 6.3.2, and 7.2.4). Thus, a complete understanding of the de-
pendence of the optimal grading exponent on ε, as ε →0+, will be crucial for
the analysis of the attainable order convergence.

Epilogue
Our voyage through the preceding eight chapters has shown that we have cer-
tainly not yet reached the end of the story on collocation methods for Volterra
functional integral and integro-differential equations. Many important ques-
tions remain unanswered. It is my belief that we have to ﬁnd new mathematical
approaches and tools (likely from very unexpected areas) if we are to make sub-
stantial progress towards ﬁnding complete solutions to these open problems.
It is the purpose of this brief ﬁnal chapter to point to some possible, and seem-
ingly very promising, new approaches for the numerical analysis of collocation
solutions to Volterra functional equations.
9.1 Semigroups and abstract resolvent theory
The long-time integration of Volterra integral and integro-differential equations
by collocation methods, in particular the asymptotic behaviour of collocation
solutions, is not yet understood. As a number of papers and books have shown
(see, e.g. Ito and Kappel (1989, 1991, 2002), Ito and Turi (1991), Brunner,
Kauthen and Ostermann (1995), Bellen and Maset (1999), Maset (1999, 2003),
and Bellen and Zennaro (2003, pp. 56–60)) the appropriate reformulation of the
given equation as an abstract Cauchy problem and the exploitation of the under-
lying semigroup or abstract resolvent framework (integrability and asymptotic
behaviour of resolvents) will often lead to deep insight into the qualitative
properties of approximate solutions.
The following books and papers will be helpful in acquiring the basic tools
necessary to investigate qualitative properties of collocation solutions to VIEs
and VIDEs, and their more general (delay and weakly singular) versions.

r Semigroup theory and sectorial operators:
These aspects of modern functional analysis are well covered in the mono-
graphs by Aubin (1979), Henry (1981), Zeidler (1990), Pr¨uss (1993), Lunardi
(1995), and Ito and Kappel (2002). See also Delfour (1980), Burns, Herdman
and Stech (1983), Staffans (1984, 1985a, 1985b), Kappel and Zhang (1986),
Burns, Herdman and Turi (1990), and Cl´ement, Desch and Homan (2003),
and the references in these papers.
r Abstract resolvent theory:
Abstract VIEs in Banach spaces and properties of resolvents are analysed in
Friedman and Shinbrot (1967), Miller (1975), Chen and Grimmer (1980),
Grimmer (1982), Grimmer and Pritchard (1983), Gripenberg and Pr¨uss
(1985), Gripenberg (1987), Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990), Pr¨uss
(1993), and Engel and Nagel (2000, Ch. VI.6/7).
Analogous results for abstract VIDEs can be found for example in Chen
and Grimmer (1982), Desch and Schappacher (1985), Desch and Grimmer
(1989); see also Gripenberg, Londen and Staffans (1990) and Pr¨uss (1993).
9.2 C∗-algebra techniques and invertibility of
approximating operator sequences
Suppose that the operator equation Ay = g, where A is a bounded linear oper-
ator acting between two inﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces, is approximated
by a sequence of approximating equations Ahuh = gh (where, for example,
h = T/N, with N →∞). Under what conditions on the approximating opera-
tor Ah does uh converge (in an appropriate norm) to the solution y of the given
operator equation?
We have encountered a typical problem of this kind in Sections 6.3 and 6.5.2,
where A represents one of the Volterra integral operators Vα or Wθ,α, and uh is
a piecewise polynomial (or non-polynomial spline) collocation solution. As we
have seen, we do not know necessary or sufﬁcient conditions for the collocation
parameters {ci} under which uh converges uniformly to y on I, as h →0.
In recent years, Silbermann and his collaborators have convincingly shown
that C∗-algebra techniques provide very powerful tools for answering such
invertibility and convergence questions in the case of, e.g. spline projection
methods for periodic pseudo-differential equations and other types of singular
integral equations. This novel approach (based on a very surprising connection
between the rather different worlds of C∗-algebra and numerical analysis) may
well yield the key tools for successfully dealing with our open problems in
collocation methods for ﬁrst-kind VIEs with weakly singular kernels.

9.3 Abstract DAEs
505
Excellent introductions to the application of C∗-algebra in the numerical
analysis of operator equations are given in the monograph by Hagen, Roch and
Silbermann (2001) and in the survey papers by Roch and Silbermann (1996),
Silbermann, Hagen and Roch (1998), and B¨ottcher (2000). The related books
by Pr¨ossdorf and Silbermann (1991) and Hagen, Roch and Silbermann (1995)
provide much of the necessary functional analysis framework.
9.3 Abstract DAEs
As we brieﬂy mentioned in Chapter 8, partial (parabolic) DAEs and (partial)
IDAEs of Volterra (or Fredholm) type can be reformulated as abstract DAEs in
an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space setting. This not only permits the exten-
sion of the notions of (tractability) index and properly stated leading terms to a
much wider class of differential-algebraic problems but also appears to furnish
the tools for the analysis of collocation methods for ordinary or partial IDAEs
of higher index.
The mathematical framework underlying the numerical analysis of abstract
DAEs is currently being developed by M¨arz and her collaborators at Hum-
boldt University in Berlin; the reader can ﬁnd an introduction to these ideas in
the paper by M¨arz (2001, pp. 330–334) and its sequel by Lamour, M¨arz and
Tischendorf (2001).
