About the Authors
Suzanne DeJohn describes her fascination with all things botanical as 
encompassing a curiosity about the natural world and a passion for the sci-
ence that explains what she sees, all wrapped up in an aesthetic sensibility 
that inspires her to fi nd beauty in the simplest expressions of nature. “As 
gardeners, we must take our cues from nature and follow the principles that 
govern healthy ecosystems. It’s the only way we can create an environment 
that can sustain us now and for generations to come.” 
Suzanne has worn a variety of hats in her twelve years with the National 
Gardening Association, including work in the education, editorial, and IT 
departments. She coordinated NGA’s online question and answer service 
for six years and has answered literally thousands of gardening questions. 
Convinced that gardeners are curious and love to learn, she was inspired to 
create the Exploring the Garden series of in-depth, online courses that teach 
the principles of botany in the context of the garden. Suzanne also does Web- 
and print-based graphic design work for NGA, takes photos for the Web sites, 
and creates illustrations to accompany articles. 
Suzanne’s varied background includes a BS in geology from Tufts; university 
courses in botany, soils, and plant pathology; a stint as a research assistant 
in plant pathology; and several years as a self-employed artist and graphic 
designer. She’s worked on a landscape crew, as well as on a dairy farm and 
an organic vegetable farm, and spent several years as a cook at a natural 
foods store. The common themes running through these seemingly disparate 
vocations are plants, beauty, nature, and healthy food. Suzanne strives for 
balance in her life by combining time spent outdoors in her gardens with 
time spent at the computer, communicating what she has learned about 
plants and gardening. 
Ann Whitman earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Plant and Soil Science 
at the University of Vermont. She also completed a Master of Arts degree 
in Landscape Design from the Conway School of Landscape Design in 
Massachusetts. Ann is the author of Trees and Shrubs For Dummies (Wiley 
Publishing, Inc.) as well as How-To Landscaping Basics and Water Gardens: 
Simple Steps to Adding the Beauty of Water to Your Garden, both published 
by Time Life. She also contributes to several gardening magazines and Web 
sites. When she’s not writing, Ann gardens on fertile river-bottom soil in 
Vermont where the winters are long and the summers are short, but worth it. 

The National Gardening Association (NGA) is committed to sustaining 
and renewing the fundamental links between people, plants, and the earth. 
Founded in 1972 as “Gardens for All” to spearhead the community garden 
movement, today’s NGA promotes environmental responsibility, advances 
multidisciplinary learning and scientifi c literacy, and creates partnerships 
that restore and enhance communities.
NGA is best known for its garden-based curricula, educational journals, inter-
national initiatives, and several youth garden grant programs. Together these 
reach more than 300,000 children nationwide each year. NGA’s Web sites, 
one for home gardeners and another for those who garden with kids, build 
community and offer a wealth of custom content.

Dedication
Suzanne dedicates this book to her husband, Dale Lane. “Your wisdom, 
integrity, generosity, and love inspire me every day.”


Acknowledgments
Suzanne would like to thanks Ann Whitman for her incredible work on the 
fi rst edition of this book. It was an honor, a pleasure, and a challenge to 
revise — and attempt to improve upon -— a book that was so fi lled with 
useful information. A big round of applause goes to Tracy Barr, the project 
editor whose insights greatly improved the organization, clarity, and usabil-
ity of the book. I’m in awe of the way she kept everyone and everything 
organized. Thanks, too, to Kathy Simpson, another editor who helped focus 
my wandering prose, and technical editor David King for scrutinizing the con-
tent. Finally, thank you to the National Gardening Association for the oppor-
tunity to write about organic gardening, a subject near and dear to my heart.

Introduction
T
his book is for people who want to grow food and maintain their land-
scape without using synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Organic 
gardening is more than just safe food, however, and it’s bigger than nontoxic 
lawns. Organic gardening is also about making conscious decisions and taking 
responsibility for actions that affect the world outside your back door, past the 
end of your driveway, and beyond the boundaries of your hometown.
Most people proudly admit to being environmentalists, but not everyone 
knows how to be a good steward of his or her own yard, let alone the entire 
planet. This book gets you started on the path to making healthier choices 
for your own garden and landscape.
About This Book
Organic gardening covers a lot of ground, so to speak — from maintaining a 
lawn and growing roses to harvesting fresh fruits and vegetables. If you’ve 
read this far, you must be curious about how to garden organically in your 
own yard. This book takes you step by step through building and maintaining 
healthy soil, encouraging helpful insects and other organisms, choosing prob-
lem-free plants, and getting your plants off to the right start. In addition to the 
basic concepts of organic gardening, it also includes information about how to 
grow vegetables, herbs, flowers, trees and shrubs, fruits and nuts, roses, and 
lawns — without harmful pesticides or synthetic chemical fertilizers.
Conventions Used in This Book
When I refer to plant hardiness — a plant’s ability to survive the winter 
extremes — I use the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Plant Hardiness Zone 
Map, which you can find in Chapter 3. All temperatures are given in degrees 
Fahrenheit and measurements in feet or inches.
A lowercase x in a species name indicates a hybrid cross. C. x lavellei, for 
example, indicates the Lavalle hawthorn, a variety of Hawthorn (Crataegus 
species).

Organic Gardening For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
When I refer to a local extension office, I’m referring to government- or 
university-sponsored services that offer helpful information on gardening. 
Look under “Extension office” or “Cooperative extension service” in the 
phone book. The name of the extension office may also be preceded by the 
name of your local land-grant college, such as “Ohio State University.”
Following are a few more conventions, designed to help you navigate your 
way through the content:
 
✓ Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are 
defined.
 
✓ Boldfaced text is used to indicate the action part of numbered steps.
 
✓ Monofont is used for Web addresses.
What You’re Not to Read
Although we’d like to believe that you want to pore over every word between 
the two yellow covers, we know that you may be in a hurry or just want the 
basic information. To help you out, we’ve made the “skippable” information 
easy to recognize: It appears in sidebars or is marked by a Technical Stuff 
icon. While interesting and related to the topic at hand, this information isn’t 
essential for you to know to have success as an organic gardener.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made some assumptions about you:
 
✓ You want to create a safe, beautiful, and healthful place for your family 
to work and play.
 
✓ You want to harvest the freshest, tastiest, and most nutritious fruits and 
vegetables possible.
 
✓ You care about the environment and are looking for information that 
helps you care for your landscape in an ecologically sound way.
 
✓ You’ve heard about organic gardening but you need more specifics and 
‘perhaps some convincing that it’s right for you.
Whether you come to this book in total gardening ignorance or have some 
experience under your fingernails, you’ll find plenty of hands-on, how-to 
information to make your organic garden and landscape the best ever.

▶ Managing pests
▶ Practicing conservation
E
veryone agrees that organic gardening means avoiding synthetic fertiliz-
ers and pesticides. But the philosophy and practice of organic gardening 
go far beyond that simple concept. Growing organic food, flowers, and land-
scapes represents a commitment to a sustainable system of living in harmony 
with nature. For many people, organic gardening is a way of life. This chapter 
deals with the fundamentals of organic growing, including the philosophy 
behind organic gardening and the specific techniques that lead to success.
Defining Organic Gardening
The ways that people use — and misuse — soil, water, and air affect the lives 
and habitats of plants, insects, birds, fish, and animals, as well as humans. 
Organic gardening is all about preventing and treating problems in the least 
obtrusive, most nontoxic ways. Dedicated organic gardeners adopt methods 
that use cultural and natural biological processes to do the following:
 
✓ Improve soil health and fertility: Organic gardeners nurture the soil 
ecosystem by adding organic matter, such as compost, and avoiding 
pesticides that can harm soil life. In turn, soil organisms consume and 
break down the organic matter, making the nutrients it contains avail-
able to plants.

8
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
✓ Decrease erosion: Exposed soil is vulnerable to erosion by rain and 
wind. By covering soil with mulch, cover crops, or other protective 
materials, organic gardeners preserve the integrity of this precious 
resource.
 
✓ Reduce pests and diseases: Organic gardeners minimize pest problems 
and reduce the need for pesticides by relying on cultural techniques, 
such as proper pruning, removing unhealthy plant material, and using 
row covers.
 
✓ Encourage plant and animal diversity: Through diverse plantings and 
judicious use of pesticides — even organic ones — organic gardeners 
promote healthy ecosystems that invite beneficial organisms, including 
pollinators and predators of garden pests, to take up residence.
Organic gardeners take their cues from nature. Instead of relying on the spray 
schedules promoted by pesticide manufacturers, organic gardeners observe 
what’s going on in their gardens and intervene to prevent pest problems. When 
you see white butterflies fluttering around your garden, for example, you know 
it’s time to protect your cabbages, broccoli, and cauliflower from cabbage 
worm. Instead of sprinkling on a pesticide after the caterpillars hatch, you can 
cover the plants with a special fabric to prevent the butterflies from laying 
eggs in the first place.
Organic growers view their gardens as living ecosystems and work with 
nature to produce beautiful landscapes and healthy foods. No matter what 
plants you’re growing — vegetables, fruits, herbs, trees, flowers, grasses — 
the same basic techniques apply, as the following sections show.
 
Depleting soil fertility, damaging and polluting ecosystems, and consuming 
excess water threaten the future of Earth’s safe and abundant food supply. 
The ways that farmers and individual gardeners and homeowners choose to 
farm, garden, and maintain their landscapes make a difference in whether the 
land can continue to house, feed, and clothe us. Gardeners around the globe 
have adopted organic gardening techniques to help nurture the health of the 
Earth and all its inhabitants. (If you need more convincing that organic is the 
way to go, turn to Chapter 2.)
Building Soil
Just as a durable house needs a strong foundation, healthy plants require soil 
that can provide their roots with nutrients, water, and air. Few gardeners are 
blessed with perfect soil, and even if they were, keeping soil healthy and able 
to support plants is an ongoing process. Building and maintaining healthy 
soil is the single most important thing you can do to ensure the success of 
your garden and landscape plants.

9
 Chapter 1: Basic Techniques in Organic Gardening
Building soil means providing soil life — microbes, worms, fungi — with the 
materials and environment they need to do their jobs. Taking from the soil 
without giving anything back breaks the natural cycle. Harvesting crops, bag-
ging lawn clippings, and raking fallen leaves removes organic material that’s 
ordinarily destined for the soil on which it falls. If the organic material isn’t 
replenished, soil health declines. Substituting synthetic chemical fertilizers 
for naturally occurring nutrients may feed plants, but it starves the soil.
Adding organic matter is the most common — and most important — part of 
building soil. Compost is a perfect source of organic matter; other sources 
include aged manures and crop residues. Maintaining proper soil pH (a mea-
sure of acidity/alkalinity) is also vital, because it affects soil life and the abil-
ity of plants to use nutrients.
Avoiding things that damage soil is just as important. Compaction from heavy 
foot or vehicle traffic and misapplied fertilizer and pesticides, for example, 
can harm the soil’s ability to support plant life. Part II tells you everything 
you need to know about your soil and how to improve it in an organically 
sound way.
Planting Wisely
Organic gardens strive to maintain healthy, balanced ecosystems. Because 
plants evolved over millennia to adapt to specific growing conditions, they 
thrive when those conditions are met. By choosing plants that match a 
garden site’s sun, shade, climate, soil type, and soil moisture, you’ll be well 
on your way to creating a healthy, thriving, pest-free landscape.
The first step in planting wisely is understanding your region’s climate, as 
well as your landscape’s particular attributes. Then you can effectively match 
plants to planting sites. You can find out more about evaluating your land-
scape in Chapter 3. For specific planting information and the lowdown on 
growing a wide variety of plants organically — vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs, 
and flowers — go to the chapters in Part IV. You can also find information in 
that part on applying organic principles to lawn care.
The second step is ensuring that your garden cultivates stable plant and animal 
communities. In nature, plants and animals live in ecosystems — communities 
in which each part contributes to and affects the lives of the other parts. In a 
balanced ecosystem (see Figure 1-1), each plant and animal species has enough 
food, water, and habitat (place to live).

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
Figure 1-1:

ties extend

and below 
ground.
 
In a balanced ecosystem, the predators have enough prey, and the prey 
have enough predators. When one part of an ecosystem dies out or becomes 
too scarce, the plants and animals that depend on its function in the envi-
ronment get out of balance, too. If honeybees disappear, for example, the 
plants that need bees for flower pollination won’t be able to produce seeds. 
If predators such as ladybugs become scarce, the insects they normally prey 
on — aphids — will become so numerous that they will seriously injure or 
even kill the plants on which they feed.
Ensuring diversity of plant types
Organic gardeners mimic nature by encouraging diversity in their land-
scapes. Natural plant communities contain many species of trees, shrubs, 
and perennial and annual plants. This rich diversity helps each plant species 
survive in many ways:
 
✓ Mixed populations avoid insect and disease devastation because all the 
plants of a particular species aren’t located next to one another. While 
pests damage or kill some plants, they overlook others.
 
✓ Deep-rooted plants often bring soil nutrients to the surface, where they 
are released by decomposition, benefiting more shallow-rooted species.

11
 Chapter 1: Basic Techniques in Organic Gardening
 
✓ Nitrogen-fixing plants, which can take nitrogen from the air and deposit 
it in the soil, benefit other species nearby.
 
✓ Tall, sun-loving species provide shade, shelter, and support for lower-
growing, shade-preferring species.
 
When plants grow artificially in monocultures, which are large colonies of a 
single species, they lose the benefits of a diverse plant community. Pests and 
diseases spread easily from one plant to the next, and plants rapidly deplete the 
soil of nutrients. A good example of the risks of monoculture is the American 
elm, which was planted as a shade tree along streets across the country. When 
Dutch elm disease was inadvertently introduced in the late 1920s, its carrier, 
the elm bark beetle, flew from tree to tree spreading the disease.
Many farmers and gardeners recognize and take advantage of the benefits 
of polyculture — growing more than one crop in a field. Growing plants that 
mutually benefit one another makes sense and is simple to do in home gar-
dens and landscapes. You can add clover to your lawn, for example, because 
clover takes nitrogen from the air and adds it to the soil. Also, you can plant 
shade-loving, ground-covering plants under leafy trees to protect soil and 
tree roots from erosion.
Encouraging animal and insect diversity
A variety of plants naturally invites a variety of wildlife and insects. Berry-
producing trees and shrubs attract birds; nectar-rich flowers draw butterflies 
and hummingbirds. Why, you may ask, do you want to encourage wildlife and 
insects in your garden? Answer: Your garden needs them. Beneficial insects 
and other creatures prey on plant pests and pollinate plants. Some of garden-
ers’ best friends include ladybugs; syrphid flies; and tiny, nonstinging parasitic 
wasps.
Edible gardens
Since ancient times gardeners have combined 
plants grown solely for their beauty with those 
grown for food. Ancient Babylonians mixed 
ornamentals and edibles in their gardens; so 
did early American colonists. The trend to 
separate food gardens from ornamental plant-
ings began in the Victorian era and culminated 
during the last few generations, when people 
began relegating food gardens to a corner of 
the backyard. Some homeowners’ associations 
even forbid food gardens in the front yard! But 
in the past few years, gardeners have shown 
renewed interest in edible landscaping — using 
edible plants throughout the landscape, grow-
ing vegetables, fruits, and herbs among flowers 
and shrubs. Organic landscapes invite this min-
gling; you don’t need to worry that the chemical 
pesticides you’ve sprayed on your roses will 
affect the edibles nearby. Refer to Chapter 7 for 
organic alternatives to synthetic pesticides.

12
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
Encourage beneficial creatures by providing a variety of habitats. Plant a 
variety of flowers so that something is in bloom all season long. Particularly 
good choices are herbs, such as basil and cilantro; plants with tiny flowers, 
such as alyssum and thyme; and plants whose small blooms are arranged in 
flat-topped flower heads, including yarrow and dill. Avoid spraying insecti-
cides, because most of them will harm beneficial creatures too; see Chapter 7 
for more information.
Here are some other ways to encourage diversity:
 
✓ Provide specific foods for the organisms you want to attract. Plant pars-
ley for the larvae of swallowtail butterflies or milkweed for monarchs, 
for example.
 
✓ Build shelters designed for birds, butterflies, native bees, and toads.
 
✓ Mimic nature by creating a layered garden with tall trees, medium 
shrubs, and lower-growing perennials and annuals.
 
✓ Include a variety of different plants, including some evergreens, to 
provide winter habitat and food.
 
✓ Provide a source of fresh water.
 
✓ Leave a section of your yard wild, or at least minimally cultivated.
 
In most natural ecosystems, pests and predators are in a balanced but 
dynamic relationship. Coyotes and bobcats keep rabbits and rodents in check; 
without these predators, the rapidly reproducing prey would soon overpopu-
late, leading to death by starvation. Pests also have a place in your garden 
because they provide food for beneficial organisms — if food is scarce, the 
beneficials will starve or leave. The tiny, nonstinging braconid wasp, for exam-
ple, is a beneficial insect that helps control pest caterpillars called horn-
worms. The wasp reproduces by laying its eggs on a hornworm. The eggs 
hatch and the developing wasps slowly devour the caterpillar as they mature. 
If you kill every hornworm, including the parasitized ones (as evidenced by 
the white cocoons along its back), you’re killing the next generation of benefi-
cial braconid wasps. Tolerating some pests will assure predators that your 
garden is a good place to hang around.
Using Integrated Pest Management
When faced with pest problems, many gardeners automatically reach for a 
can or jar of poison. Using pesticides to kill insects deprives the pests’ natu-
ral predators of food, which causes the predators to decline, necessitating 

13
 Chapter 1: Basic Techniques in Organic Gardening
more pesticides to achieve pest control (refer to the preceding section for 
details). It’s a vicious cycle. In addition, pesticides often kill more than just 
their intended targets. Beneficial insects and spiders that prey on plant pests 
and pollinate flowers die, too. And if pesticides drift on the wind or water 
away from their target, fish and birds may be poisoned as well.
Organic gardeners choose a different approach. Instead of fighting pests and 
disease with chemical warfare, organic gardeners strive to create healthy, 
balanced ecosystems. If pest problems arise, the gardeners look first for the 
least toxic, least environmentally disruptive solutions.
Integrated pest management (IPM) combines biological, cultural, physical, and 
chemical strategies to control pests. In plain English, that means using the 
easiest, least environmentally harmful, cheapest methods first and using the 
more expensive, toxic methods only as a last resort.
Managing pests through IPM involves the following steps:
 
1. Prevention.
 
 Keeping pests and diseases out of the garden in the first place is more 
than half the battle won. Inspecting new plants, cleaning your tools, 
eliminating weeds, and using best watering practices help prevent the 
spread of potential problems.
 
2. Crop monitoring.
 
 You have to know exactly what pest you’re dealing with, when it 
appears, how many individuals you have, and on what plants.
 
3. Cultural controls.
 
 Strategies such as rotating crops to avoid planting related plants in the 
same spot each year and choosing pest-resistant varieties will minimize 
problems.
 
4. Mechanical controls.
 
 You can prevent pests from getting on your plants in the first place. 
Examples include covering plants with special fabrics or using hot 
water, air, fire, and the heat of the sun to kill pests without poisons. 
Simply knocking pests into a can of soapy water does the trick too.
 
5. Biological controls.
 
 Take advantage of nature’s law that every organism has a natural con-
trol. You can buy and release many of these control organisms, such as 
ladybugs and beneficial nematodes, or encourage the ones that already 
exist around your garden.

14
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
6. Chemical controls.
 
 Chemicals are the last resort. Start with the least toxic pesticides, choos-
ing kinds that target only the pest and don’t affect innocent bystanders, 
such as bees and spiders.
Part III is devoted to pest management.
Managing Nutrients
Plants need nutrients to grow; flourish; and fend off pests, diseases, and 
environmental stresses. Giving them what they need is a key to successful 
organic gardening, but as with humans, overdoing poor food choices spells 
trouble. The best way to feed plants is to feed the soil. Vast numbers of bene-
ficial organisms call the soil home; nourish them, and you nourish the plants. 
Adding organic matter, such as compost, provides fungi, bacteria, earth-
worms, and other soil dwellers both food and a hospitable environment. In 
turn, they break down this organic matter into nutrients that plants can use.
In some cases, you may need to apply extra nutrients to keep plants healthy. 
Using organic slow-release fertilizers encourages strong, steady, healthy 
plant growth. Most organic fertilizers provide a broad range of nutrients, and 
they won’t harm soil life or hurt plant roots. 
The synthetic fertilizers that conventional gardeners use provide a few spe-
cific nutrients in a form that plants take up immediately. They make plants 
grow quickly but don’t necessarily make them grow strong and healthy 
because fast-growing leaves and stems are soft and juicy — and very invit-
ing to pests. Plus, any applied nutrients that the plants can’t use are wasted, 
sometimes running off to pollute waterways. Synthetic fertilizers usually 
come in concentrated liquids or granules that you must dilute in water, and 
improperly diluted solutions can burn plant roots. 
Turn to Chapter 5 for information on soil-building, and see Chapter 6 for 
information on organic fertilizers.
Conserving Inputs
Most organic gardeners are conservative — in the true sense of the word. We 
reduce, recycle, reuse, and in general try to limit what we buy. In the garden, 
conservation means reusing the nutrients contained in plant matter by com-
posting kitchen scraps and garden trimmings. It also means taking care not to 
waste water and making sure that the products you use in your garden don’t 
put an undue burden on the environment.

15
 Chapter 1: Basic Techniques in Organic Gardening
Water
Communities across the country are experiencing record drought, and some 
municipalities are enacting watering restrictions. A well-designed, organic 
landscape adapts better to restricted watering because the soil has been nur-
tured and plants are well adapted. Still, even organic gardeners must water 
once in a while.
The ideal watering system applies moisture directly to the place where it’s 
needed: the roots. Soaker hoses and drip irrigation are best; they apply water 
slowly, right to the soil, where it can soak in rather than run off. Overhead 
sprinklers are worst, especially if they’re used on a hot, sunny day. Up to 
one third of the water applied is lost to evaporation, and water inadvertently 
applied to driveways and sidewalks runs off into storm drains, carrying pol-
lutants with it.
Consider the source
Look at where the products you use in your garden originate. You may be 
surprised. Is using bagged bark mulch shipped thousands of miles good for 
the environment, especially if local mulch is available? Does it make sense 
to buy bat guano from distant caves when a local farm can supply aged cow 
manure?
As the price of fuel rises, the cost of shipping goods thousands of miles will 
force consumers to look for products that originate closer to home. You may 
be surprised by what you can find just down the road: wood shavings from 
furniture factories; grounds from nearby coffee shops; brewery waste; mulch 
from municipal Christmas-tree-recycling programs and tree-trimming compa-
nies; and small-scale composting operations.
 
Think creatively! I buy the ends of newsprint rolls from the printer of our 
daily paper. Instead of laying down individual sheets of newspaper under 
mulch to prevent weeds — a daunting task on a breezy day — I simply unroll 
the newsprint and spread mulch as I go. Shredded paper is a good addition to 
the compost pile.

Why Garden Organically?
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping your family healthy
▶ Protecting and preserving the environment
G
ardeners may choose organic growing techniques for several reasons. 
Some do so because they believe organic gardens and landscapes are 
better for their health and the health of their families. Others grow organi-
cally because they believe this practice is better for the environment. And 
some gardeners believe organic gardens are more productive and beautiful. 
I grow organically for all these reasons and because, when I do so, I become 
part of the legacy of people who honor the health of the Earth and all its 
inhabitants by using growing techniques that are safe and sustainable over 
the long term.
This chapter outlines some of the reasons why gardeners choose organic 
methods. If you’re unsure about committing to organic growing or you need

Probably the main reason why many people garden organically is to provide 
their families with safe, wholesome food and a toxin-free environment. Many 
gardeners believe that organically grown foods taste better, and recent stud-
ies show that organically grown foods may have higher nutrient levels than 
their conventionally grown counterparts. Organic growers also steer clear of 
genetically modified plants, the health risks of which are still unclear.

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
Alternative to synthetic pesticides
When it comes to health and safety, pesticides pose the greatest concern in 
gardening. Americans use about 4.5 billion pounds of pesticides each year in 
yards, gardens, homes, farms, and industry, about 1 billion pounds of which 
are synthetic pesticides. Despite a complex system of rules, regulations, and 
labeling requirements, thousands of people suffer acute pesticide poison-
ing each year. Like most gardeners, organic growers may occasionally need 
to use pesticides, but they choose them carefully, opting for the least-toxic 
organic sprays as a last resort — only after other control measures have 
failed.
 
Many people assume that organic means nontoxic, but that’s not really correct. 
Some commonly accepted organic pesticides are, strictly speaking, more toxic 
than some synthetic chemical pesticides. But in general, organic pesticides, 
which are derived from plant, animal, and mineral sources, tend to be less 
toxic than synthetic chemical pesticides, which are created from petroleum and 
other chemical sources. More important, organic pesticides tend to break 
down quickly into benign substances, whereas synthetic pesticides can linger 
in the environment for decades.
 
Many of the synthetic pesticides used today belong to a group of chemical 
compounds called organophosphates. They’re used to control insect pests on 
fruits and vegetables, to combat termites, and to control fleas and ticks on 
pets. These chemicals work by interfering with the nervous systems of the 
pests. Unfortunately, organophosphates can also harm the nervous systems of 
animals and humans. In fact, they are chemically similar to the World War 
II–era chemical-warfare agent known as nerve gas. In humans, symptoms of 
overexposure include nausea, headache, convulsions, and (in high doses) 
death. Diazinon and chlorpyrifos, two recently banned pesticides discussed in 
the sidebar “How unsafe pesticides remain on the market,” fall into this cate-
gory. Unfortunately, since diazinon and chlorpyrifos have been phased out, 
the use of carbaryl, an insecticide that also damages the nervous system, has 
increased. The EPA classifies this product as a likely human carcinogen.
Despite extensive testing by chemical companies in controlled trials, it’s hard 
to know exactly what pesticides will do out in the real world. Ponder these 
statistics: The EPA now considers 60 percent of herbicides, 90 percent of fun-
gicides, and 30 percent of insecticides to be potentially carcinogenic (able to 
cause cancer). A study conducted by the National Cancer Institute found that 
farmers exposed to chemical herbicides had a six-times-greater risk of devel-
oping cancer than farmers who were not exposed. Scary stuff.
 
No matter what type of pesticide you’re using — organic or synthetic — you 
must follow label directions to the letter. Read all warnings, wear recom-
mended protective gear, and use only as instructed. Taking these precautions 
isn’t just smart, it’s also the law.

19
 Chapter 2: Why Garden Organically?
More nutrients in organically grown foods
Most organic gardeners will tell you that the fruits and vegetables they har-
vest from their gardens taste better than their supermarket counterparts. Are 
the foods healthier, too? A multi-million-dollar, four-year study of the benefits 
of organic food, funded by the European Union (EU), suggests that some 
organically grown foods are more nutritious than their nonorganic counter-
parts. The study — the largest of its kind — also found that in some cases 
organically grown foods had higher levels of antioxidants, which are believed 
to be beneficial in fighting cancer and heart disease.
Why is organically grown food more nutritious? Scientists aren’t sure, but 
here are a couple of tantalizing ideas:
 
✓ Nonorganic fertilizers may force rapid plant growth: Research sug-
gests that the soluble nitrogen fertilizer applied in nonorganic gardens 
forces rapid but weak plant growth, and that these plants contain fewer 
of the antioxidants needed to protect their own health — the same anti-
oxidants that protect our health.
How unsafe pesticides remain on the market
When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) bans a pesticide, it usually phases it out 
over several years. In some cases, products 
already on store shelves or in home garden 
sheds may legally be sold and used even though 
they have been banned. (You have to ask your-
self why, if a product is worthy of banning, it’s 
also worthy of being sold until the stockpile is 
used up.) Consider the recently banned pesti-
cides diazinon and chlorpyrifos:
 ✓ Diazinon: The EPA banned residential use 
of diazinon in 2002, beginning with a ban on 
using diazinon indoors. Outdoor and garden 
use was not phased out until two years 
later.
 ✓ Chlorpyrifos: On June 8, 2000, the EPA 
announced that many of the currently 
labeled uses of insecticides containing 
chlorpyrifos, including Dursban and 
Lorsban, would be canceled. But selling 
the products became unlawful only after 
December 31, 2001 — 18 months later.
The task of removing a chemical from a product 
is daunting. Manufacturers must change their 
products, modify packaging, rework their mar-
keting materials, and inform tens of thousands of 
retailers nationwide to pull products containing 
the chemical. A comprehensive public relations 
campaign to inform consumers of the risks as 
well as safe alternatives is also required. Then 
any leftover pesticides containing the banned 
substance must be disposed of safely. When a 
chemical pesticide comes under suspicion, it 
can be years before consumers are affected. 
That’s one reason why I avoid these pesticides. 
I’d rather not take the chance that I’m unwit-
tingly using a dangerous product.

20
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
✓ Higher nutrient levels in organically grown foods may be linked to 
healthier soil: Several studies comparing the nutrient levels in differ-
ent fruits and vegetables show an apparent decline in food nutrient 
content over the past 70 years. Studies suggest that this decline may be 
the result of soils that have been depleted by an industrial agriculture 
system that relies on synthetic fertilizers rather than on the soil-building 
techniques favored by organic growers.
Fewer genetically modified organisms
Along with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, organic growers avoid plant-
ing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) — organisms whose DNA has 
been altered through genetic engineering. Introduced to commercial farmers 
in the early 1990s, GMOs have raised concerns among health activists and 
environmentalists.
Historically, plant breeding was confined to cross-pollination: The pollen of a 
flower from one plant was transferred to the stigma of a flower from another 
plant. If pollination was successful, the flowers produced viable seeds, and 
if the breeders were lucky, one of the plants that grew from those seeds had 
the beneficial traits the breeders were seeking. The plants had to be com-
patible for pollination to occur; usually, that meant they had to be the same 
species. Hybrid plants are created through complex, carefully controlled 
cross-pollination. Genetically modified plants, on the other hand, are created 
by introducing genes of completely unrelated species. The unrelated species 
don’t even have to be plants!
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proclaims that genetically 
modified (GM) foods are no different from their hybrid counterparts and 
therefore needn’t be labeled as such. But the public’s concern about genetic 
engineering reflects the notion that mixing the genes of entirely different 
organisms just isn’t right. Food activists coined the term “Frankenfoods,” and 
although the specter of a fish with feathers is evocative, the biggest health 
risks likely lay in the potential for allergic responses when foreign genetic 
materials are consumed.
GMOs pose environmental risks, too. Farmers regularly plant GMO varieties 
of soybean, corn, canola, and cotton. Some of these varieties have been geneti-
cally modified with DNA from a soil bacterium to resist the synthetic herbicide 
glyphosate so that farmers can spray fields to control weeds without damaging 
crops. The result has been the evolution of “super weeds” that are increasingly 
resistant to the herbicide. Now researchers are racing to introduce GMOs that 
are also resistant to dicamba, another synthetic herbicide. How many more 
genetic mutations and rounds of super weeds do we need before we see that 
this strategy is flawed?

21
 Chapter 2: Why Garden Organically?
Similarly, some crops have been altered to contain the bacteria Bacillus thu-
ringiensis (Bt), an important biological control used by organic farmers for 
decades. Pests such as corn earworm are quickly developing resistance to 
this formerly safe and effective control, leaving organic farmers searching for 
alternatives.
Although GMOs are currently marketed only to commercial growers, that 
may not always be the case. And if you live near a farm growing GMOs, pollen 
from those fields may contaminate your backyard crop. The danger of geneti-
cally modified crops is hotly debated, and the EU has placed strong restric-
tions on growing GMOs.
Organic Growing for the Environment
The Earth’s population continues to grow, but the amount of land available 
for growing food is disappearing rapidly. Erosion, development, pollution, 
dwindling water supplies, and other human-induced and natural disruptions 
threaten safe food and water supplies. Plant and animal species continue to 
disappear at alarming rates as humans damage and encroach on their habitats.
Many gardeners work to improve this grim picture by making personal 
choices that, at the very least, do as little harm to the environment as pos-
sible. The way you choose to grow flowers and food and to maintain the land-
scape can actually improve the quality of the soil, air, and water, as well as 
the lives of the organisms that depend on them.
Protecting wildlife
Organic gardeners strive to maintain a balanced ecosystem in which all 
creatures, even garden pests, play a role. They rely on nontoxic techniques, 
such as row covers and repellents, to manage pests, not eradicate them. By 
allowing the presence of some pests, organic gardeners encourage the pests’ 
natural predators to take up residence. And when pests and predators are in 
balance, everyone wins.
Sometimes, even organic gardeners may choose to use pesticides as a last 
resort. When they do, they keep in mind that, while pesticides kill pests, they 
can harm innocent bystanders as well. When possible, organic gardeners 
choose products that affect only the pest they’re trying to control.
Most organic pesticides break down quickly into harmless substances once 
they’re exposed to air, sunlight, and/or water. Many synthetic pesticides, on 
the other hand, are formulated to keep working — killing — long after the 
need is passed. These long-lasting pesticides not only continue killing pests, 
they can also accumulate in the bodies of animals, harming them over a long 

22
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
period. In the case of the infamous DDT, which was banned in the United 
States in 1972, the chemical accumulated in fish, rodents, and other animals. 
When predators such as hawks and eagles ate those animals, they accumu-
lated increasingly larger quantities of DDT, too. As a result, they laid eggs 
with thin shells that broke before they hatched, destroying generations of 
birds and sending many species to the brink of extinction. Even today, tens of 
millions of birds are killed each year as a result of pesticide use.
Pesticide contamination of wildlife has serious implications for humans, too. 
In its report Chemicals in Sportfish and Game: 2008-2009 Health Advisories, the 
New York State Department of Health listed 136 bodies of water with specific 
fish consumption advisories. The report suggests that women of childbearing 
age, infants, and children younger than 15 should avoid eating fish from these 
waters and that others should limit their intake to no more than one meal per 
month. Pesticides, including chlordane and DDT, are listed as contaminants 
in some of the lakes and streams. Advisories such as this exist throughout 
the United States.
Helping pollinators
Pollination occurs when pollen is moved within flowers or from one flower 
to another of the same species, leading to fertilization and successful seed 
and fruit production. Some plants, like corn, are pollinated by wind. However, 
nearly 80 percent of the world’s crop plants, including alfalfa, apples, blueber-
ries, cotton, and melons, depend on insects or other pollinators to transfer 
their pollen. According to the North American Pollinator Protection campaign, 
30 percent of the foods we eat require the presence of a pollinating insect.
Although concern for the welfare of pollinating insects has been growing 
among scientists for decades, it wasn’t until a crisis dubbed Colony Collapse 
Disorder (CCD) caught the media’s attention that the general public took 
notice. During the winter of 2006–2007, U.S. beekeepers reported losses of 50 
percent to 90 percent of their hives. Researchers are still trying to determine 
the cause, but many think that a combination of disease-related and environ-
mental factors may be involved.
Whatever the cause, CCD has awakened us to our utter dependence on the 
honeybee — a non-native species that was brought here from Europe by 
early settlers. Before that, plants relied on native pollinators, such as soli-
tary bees, bumblebees, wasps, butterflies, and beetles. Unfortunately, the 
populations of these native pollinators have dwindled, due at least in part 
to pesticide use.
Using organic growing practices can help reverse this trend. By growing 
diverse plants, choosing plants specifically to attract and feed pollinators, 
and minimizing pesticide use, home gardeners can play an important role in 
increasing the populations of pollinating insects.

23
 Chapter 2: Why Garden Organically?
Minimizing water contamination
The U.S. Geological Survey conducted a decade-long study of pesticides in 
our nation’s surface water and groundwater. (Surface water includes above-
ground sources, such as streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Groundwater 
flows below ground in cracks in bedrock and between soil particles, collect-
ing in large saturated areas called aquifers.) Half of the U.S. population uses 
surface-water sources for drinking water; the other half gets drinking water 
from groundwater via dug or drilled wells.
The results, published in 2006, show that at least one pesticide was detected 
in water from every stream studied. Groundwater fared a bit better. Between 
one third and one half of groundwater sampled from wells contained one or 
more pesticides. Although in most cases, the concentration of pesticides was 
well below levels considered to be harmful to human health, the results show 
that pesticide contamination is widespread.
Surface waters become polluted from runoff — water flows over the ground, 
carrying pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and soil with it. Traces of triazine 
herbicides, which farmers use on corn and other crops, have been found in 
more than 90 percent of Midwestern surface waters. Researchers also found 
triazines in raindrops in 23 states. Even at very low concentrations, these 
chemicals can harm aquatic life.
Fertilizers pose an additional threat:
 
✓ Excess nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers from lawns, farms, and gar-
dens wash into streams, lakes, and oceans, where they contribute to 
excess algae growth. Densely growing algae depletes the oxygen in the 
water, which can kill fish and suffocate the native plant species.
 
✓ Nitrogen, the main element in most fertilizers, also moves easily through 
the soil, especially when mixed with water from rain, snowmelt, or 
irrigation, and enters the groundwater, contaminating wells and other 
sources of drinking water. High concentrations of nitrate — a common 
nitrogen compound — can be toxic to children younger than 6 months 
old and to other mammals, including cattle, sheep, and horses.
 
We can’t control what commercial farmers spray on their crops. But we can 
choose to use safe products in our own landscapes and support farmers who 
grow their crops in environmentally sound ways. As an organic gardener, 
when you have to resort to using pesticides, you can choose organic alterna-
tives that have less impact on the environment than their synthetic counter-
parts. Also, you can ask local farms about their pesticide use and purchase 
from those that espouse the principles you believe in.

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
Preventing erosion
It takes 500 years to produce 1 inch of natural topsoil — the rich matrix of 
humus, minerals, and microorganisms that plants depend on for growth. 
Plants in turn hold the topsoil in place with their roots and shelter it with 
their leaves. Soil without plants erodes easily, washing away with runoff from 
rain and snow or blowing away in the wind.
When soil washes into streams, rivers, and lakes, it significantly disrupts 
those ecosystems and pollutes the water. In fact, sediment accounts for 
nearly 50 percent of all lake pollution and 22 percent of river pollution, 
according to a 1991 U.S. government report. Erosion devastates farmland, 
too. The United States loses 2 million acres of arable land (land that’s suit-
able for growing crops) each year due to soil erosion. The Iowa Department 
of Agriculture reported that half of that state’s topsoil had eroded by the 
early 1980s. Experts report that 30 percent of arable land was lost worldwide 
in the last 40 years of the 20th century, due in part to erosion.
What happens in your own small garden plot may seem insignificant com-
pared with these mind-numbing statistics, but how you garden does play a 
role in the bigger picture. Gardeners can help reduce erosion by keeping 
plants growing on or covering the soil throughout the year; preserving and 
encouraging humus formation; and avoiding excessive tilling, disruption, and 
compacting of the soil.
Conserving water
Fresh, clean water is a scarce and limited resource. Only 1 percent of all the 
water on Earth is freshwater; the rest is saltwater in the oceans and ice in 
polar regions. The water cycle is a closed system; the amount of water in the 
world remains the same but changes its form, from fog to rain to rivers to 
groundwater.
A typical U.S. household uses about 350 gallons of water per day. 
Collectively, that’s an average of 26 billion gallons of freshwater every day. 
Up to half the water consumed by many homeowners in summer is used to 
water lawns and gardens. And when water is applied improperly, much of it 
runs off into sewers and storm drains, carrying pesticides from lawns, motor 
oil from driveways, and anything else in its path.
Organic gardeners need to water their gardens, too, but they take steps to 
minimize use, waste, and contamination. Grouping plants according to water 
needs, using drip irrigation and soaker hoses, applying mulch, reducing the 
amount of water-hungry lawn, and watering only when necessary are a few 
ways to conserve water.

25
 Chapter 2: Why Garden Organically?
Some gardeners use rain barrels connected to gutters to collect and store 
water for later use. Others build rain gardens — specially landscaped areas 
designed to collect rainwater and allow it to soak into the ground rather than 
run off. Conservation of this precious resource just makes sense, and it’s 
especially critical in many regions of the United States that are facing serious 
drought.
What Constitutes “Organic”? The 
U.S. Government Gets Involved
When synthetic pesticides and fertilizers became available in the early and 
middle twentieth century, mainstream farmers embraced them; others 
bucked the system, remaining committed to what they believed were more 
ecologically sound farming practices. What began as fringe groups in the 
United States and Europe evolved into organizations espousing specific prac-
tices and certifying farms that practiced them. In the United States, dozens 
of regional groups created rules and certified farm products as organic. 
Regional organization made sense, because most organic farms were small, 
family-run operations that served their local populations.
Things got a bit more confusing when the organic movement gained momen-
tum. Owners of large corporate farms — agribusinesses — realized that con-
sumers were willing to pay a premium for foods labeled organic and began 
marketing their own produce as organic. But no one could say precisely what 
the term organic meant. To try to clear up the issue, the federal government 
got involved.
The Organic Foods Production Act
The Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA), enacted as part of the 1990 Farm 
Bill, set the stage for establishing uniform national standards for the produc-
tion and handling of foods labeled organic. The Act authorized the creation 
of a new USDA National Organic Program and established an advisory group 
called the National Organic Standards Board to help determine the rules.
The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) includes a set of standards for 
organic growing. Pesticides, fertilizers, and other farm and garden products 
meeting these standards are acceptable for use in USDA-certified organic 
farming, production, and processing operations. In a nutshell, here’s what’s 
acceptable and what’s not under NOP standards:
 
✓ Acceptable: Most horticultural oils and soaps, most copper- and sulfur-
based fungicides, seaweed extracts, rock powders, and animal manures

26
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
✓ Not acceptable: Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, genetically modified 
organisms, and sewage-sludge fertilizers
Although some people label the National Organic Program as a watering-
down of the principles of organic farming, it does ensure that the products 
you buy meet certain criteria.
 
The rules can be a bit confusing and are continually evolving as new products 
are introduced. Fortunately, there’s an easy way to determine whether a prod-
uct is all right to use in your organic garden: Look for an OMRI logo on the 
label (see Figure 2-1).
 
Figure 2-1: 
The OMRI 
logo.
 
The Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) is a national not-for-profit 
organization that evaluates products and determines whether they are 
approved for use in certified organic farming. The OMRI designation on prod-
ucts assures you that the products conform to NOP standards. Learn more 
about OMRI at www.omri.org.
 
Must home gardeners abide by the same rules as commercial operations? Of 
course not. But using OMRI-listed products assures you that the NOP finds 
them acceptable. Your approach doesn’t have to be all or nothing, however. 
Although I believe that the organic approach is best, you may choose to use a 
nonorganic fertilizer or pesticide for a particular situation.
New trends in the organic movement
Can a 1,000-acre corporate farm, growing just one or two crops and owned by 
shareholders who expect the largest return on their investment, truly espouse 
the heart and soul of organic growing? Will health and the environment end 
up playing second fiddle to the bottom line of these huge agribusinesses? 
Some organic gardeners — and consumers — who espouse organic growing 
primarily because no harmful pesticides are used might say the nationaliza-
tion of organic agriculture is a good thing, if it means fewer farm chemicals 
are being used. Those who see organic growing as a holistic endeavor that 
encompasses techniques to nurture above- and below-ground ecosystems 
might argue otherwise.

27
 Chapter 2: Why Garden Organically?
The nationalization of the organic movement has spawned a new movement, 
one that focuses more on preserving and expanding local agriculture and less 
on rules and regulations. This local movement believes in nurturing the rela-
tionship between farmer and consumer. The latest buzzword among garden-
ers and nongardeners alike is locavore — a person who strives to eat locally 
grown foods. Backyard vegetable gardeners are the ultimate locavores, but 
most of us can’t raise all our own food.
Another buzzword is sustainable, which can be defined as the ability of some-
thing to continue indefinitely. To me, a sustainable landscape is one in which 
few, if any, external materials are required. The nutrients in organic matter 
are recycled and fallen leaves are used as mulch. Energy is provided by good, 
old-fashioned, elbow grease, rather than petroleum-powered mowers and 
trimmers. Plants and animals — including humans — exist in harmony.
 
Here’s the U.S. government’s definition of sustainable agriculture: “An inte-
grated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific 
application that will, over the long term, satisfy human food and fiber needs; 
enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the 
agricultural economy depends; make the most efficient use of nonrenewable 
resources and on-farm resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural 
biological cycles and controls; sustain the economic viability of farm opera-
tions; and enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.” That 
definition isn’t quite warm and fuzzy, but even in the language of bureaucrats, 
it’s more a value system than a set of rules.
Pioneers of organic growing
Advocates of natural farming methods eschew 
the “chemical” way of doing things, believing 
that that it disrupts the natural ecological order, 
creating an escalating cycle of dependency on 
stronger and newer chemicals. Following are 
a few pioneers of organic agriculture and the 
systems they created in response to chemical 
farming:
 ✓ Biodynamic agriculture, Rudolf Steiner: 
Steiner, an Austrian philosopher, studied 
the relationships between plants and their 
environment to develop a holistic grow-
ing system called biodynamic agriculture, 
which made use of plants’ rates of growth, 
favored environments, and relationships 
with other plants. He found, for example, that 
some plants grow better when grown next 
to certain other plant species. Biodynamic 
agriculture is still widely practiced 
throughout the world. You can learn more 
about biodynamics from the Biodynamic 
Farming and Gardening Association 
(www.biodynamics.com).
 ✓ Biodynamic/French intensive method, 
Alan Chadwick: Chadwick combined bio-
dynamics with the agricultural practices 
he learned in France, in which plants grow 
in wide rows of deeply loosened, compost-
fed soil. Chadwick brought his techniques 
to the United States in the 1960s, when 
(continued)

28
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
he accepted a teaching position at the 
University of California at Santa Cruz.
 ✓ Biointensive mini-farming, John Jeavons: 
In the 1970s, Jeavons combined the methods 
he learned from Chadwick with sustainable 
agricultural practices from ancient cultures 
to create a new organic method called bio-
intensive mini-farming. He wanted to find 
the smallest area needed to produce all his 
own food, clothing, income, and building 
materials. Jeavons’s techniques allow 
anyone, anywhere, to produce all the veg-
etables one person needs for a year with 
100 square feet and a four- to six-month 
growing season. Learn more about bioin-
tensive techniques from Ecology Action 
(www.growbiointensive.org).
 ✓ Polyculture, Masanoba Fukuoka: Fukuoka, 
a Japanese farmer, developed a system 
of agriculture that uses no compost or soil 
turning; his method uses specific mixes of 
plants and animals to feed and protect the 
soil. Polyculture, the practice of growing 
multiple crops together so that each ben-
efits the others, is part of this system. For 
more information about Fukuoka’s tech-
niques, refer to his book The One-Straw 
Revolution (Other India Press, 1992).
 ✓ Permaculture, Bill Mollison and David 
Holmgren: Mollison, an Australian ecolo-
gist, and his student, David Holmgren, 
founded permaculture in the 1970s. In a 
permaculture system, the gardener 
designs the garden and landscape as a 
closed system. Collected rainwater irri-
gates the crops; plant and animal waste 
returns to the soil; plants and animals 
benefit one another by serving multiple 
purposes. To learn more about permacul-
ture, see Mollison’s book Introduction to 
Permaculture (Tagari Publications, 1997) 
and the Permaculture Institute Web site 
(www.permaculture.org).
 ✓ Forest gardening, Robert Hart: Hart, 
observing the food-growing practices of 
indigenous peoples in and near forests 
worldwide, noted that traditional forest gar-
deners obtained their food from many layers 
of the forest and surrounding areas. Similar 
in many ways to permaculture, forest gar-
dening creates an ecosystem that benefits 
plants and animals as well as humans. Find 
out more from Hart’s book Forest Gardening 
(Chelsea Green Publishing, 1996).
 ✓ Rodale Institute, J. I. Rodale: While 
European gardeners were developing and 
promoting organic gardening techniques 
in the 1940s and ’50s, American publisher 
J. I. Rodale established an organic farm 
in Pennsylvania. He called his vision of 
sustainable food culture regenerative 
agriculture and worked to spread his 
techniques worldwide. Rodale began pub-
lishing Organic Gardening and Farming 
magazine in 1942 and founded the Soil 
and Health Foundation, now called the 
Rodale Institute, in 1947. His son Robert 
took over the reins in the 1970s, buying 
more farmland and establishing an experi-
mental farm. For information about the 
institute’s many activities, visit its Web site 
(www.rodaleinstitute.org).
By growing organically, you too can join an 
international community of gardeners and farm-
ers who are committed to protecting the Earth 
and growing wholesome, healthful food.

D
esign is fundamental to successful organic gardening. Well-placed 
plants can shelter your house; provide refuge for wildlife; and give you 
all the fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers you desire. This chapter may be 
the most important one in the book because it’s about putting plants in the 
right places and starting them off on the right foot, so to speak. It provides 
an overview of designing all types of gardens. For specific information on 
individual categories of plants, see Chapters 13 through 20.
Factors Affecting Your Design Decisions
Plants come in a huge variety of shapes, sizes, and habits. Knowing some-
thing about plant characteristics and getting familiar with descriptive terms 
makes choosing and using plants easier. Like any hobby, gardening has a 
vocabulary of its own that allows enthusiasts to communicate effectively. 
Here’s a rundown of terms to understand before you start your garden plan.
Life cycles: Annual, biennial, 
and perennial
Different plants have different life cycles — the amount of time it takes for 
them to become mature enough to bloom, produce seed, and ultimately die. 
Plants belong in one of three categories: annuals, biennials, and perennials.

30
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
✓ Annuals: Annuals complete their life cycle in a single growing season. 
They typically sprout from seed in the spring, bloom, produce seed, and 
die before winter comes again. With proper care, most annual flowers 
will bloom continuously all summer, right up until frost. If you want the 
most bang for your buck, flowerwise, choose annual plants. Most garden 
vegetables and many herbs are annuals (or we treat them as such). 
Because they die in fall, annuals must be replanted every year.
 
✓ Biennials: Biennials live for two growing seasons. In the first year, 
they sprout and grow leaves and roots. The flowers and seeds come in 
the second growing season, after which the plant dies. Biennials are 
relatively uncommon in home gardens.
 
✓ Perennials: Perennials live for at least three seasons, and many live 
much longer in the right climate (in the wrong climate, they act more 
like annuals). Perennials can be herbaceous, those with stems that die 
to the ground in the winter and grow back from their roots, or woody, 
those with tough, persistent stems or trunks (think trees, shrubs, and 
woody vines). Woody perennials create a backdrop for other plants, and 
provide habitat for wildlife.
 
 Perennial flowers tend to have a distinct bloom period lasting several 
weeks, although some flower sporadically throughout the summer. By 
choosing a combination of early-, mid-, and late-season bloomers, you 
can have continuous color as different flowers bloom and fade.
Deciduous, evergreen, and conifer
Plants are also characterized by whether they keep their leaves year-round, 
and they fall into these categories:
 
✓ Deciduous plants: These plants grow new leaves each spring. In autumn, 
those leaves die and fall off, leaving branches bare until spring.
 
✓ Evergreen plants: These plants keep their leaves year-round. Although 
most shed leaves occasionally, their branches are never bare. Following 
are two examples of evergreens:
 
• Needled evergreens, which include pines and spruces. (Think 
Christmas trees.)
 
• Broadleaf evergreens, which have non-needle-like leaves. This 
category includes rhododendrons and most hollies.
 
 Some herbaceous perennials, such as candytuft and hellebore, are 
evergreen. Others, such as bearded iris, are evergreen in warm climates 
and deciduous in cold climates; plants like these are sometimes 
described as semievergreen. And sometimes varieties of the same plant 
differ — evergreen and deciduous daylilies, for example.

31
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Organic Landscape
 
✓ Conifers: Conifers are plants that bear cones. Although most conifers 
are evergreens, exceptions occur. One exception is larch (also known 
as tamarack), which is a conifer that loses its needles and is known as a 
deciduous conifer.
 
Whether a plant drops its leaves is an important consideration in garden 
design. If you want a year-round screen between your home and your 
neighbors, make sure that the plants you choose are evergreen. To find out 
which of these categories a plant fits into, read plant descriptions carefully; 
don’t make assumptions based on generalizations; and try to find information 
specific to your gardening climate.
Type of leaves, flowers, and roots
This section isn’t a botany lesson. The reason you need to know plant parts 
when you’re planning a garden is that it will help you choose plants with 
flowers and foliage that complement each other from a design perspective, 
and it will help you foresee challenges such as trying to plant under trees 
with shallow roots.
Leaves
Each leaf characteristic influences the overall appearance of a plant. I won’t 
bore you with the scores of words botanists have come up with to describe 
leaves, but here are a few of the most useful categories:
 
✓ Color: Like beauty, color is in the eye of the beholder. Foliage described 
as black is often dark maroon, for example. (Plant breeders take license 
when naming new varieties, so try to find photos or live samples.) 
Variegated foliage has leaves with two or more colors in them.
 
✓ Size: Look for actual measurements if leaf size is a concern.
 
✓ Shape: Most descriptions use everyday language, but you may run 
across botanical terms such as ovate (egg-shaped), lanceolate (lance-
like), and cordate (heart-shaped). Figure 3-1 shows some common leaf 
shapes.
 
✓ Surface texture: Leaves can be shiny and smooth, hairy, fuzzy, or 
wrinkled.
Flowers
Knowing what a plant’s flowers look like can help you find the most 
complementary place for the plant in your garden. Some plants, like most 
daffodils, have single flowers, which come one to a stem. Others produce 
clusters of flowers in a wide array of shapes (a variety of which are shown in 
Figure 3-2).

Roots
Roots don’t get much attention, but the kind of roots a plant has can give you 
hints about its culture. Plants generally have one of two kinds of roots:
 
✓ Fibrous roots are finely branched and grow close to the soil surface. 
Plants with fibrous roots are easy to transplant and divide into new 
plants, but are more easily damaged by drought and cold weather.
 
✓ Taproots usually are thick and long, reaching deep into the soil. After 
they’re established, taproots are difficult to move, but they tolerate 
temporary drought.
 
Some plants, such as clematis, have particularly shallow root systems that 
are easily damaged by cultivation, so use extra caution when weeding around 
them. Maple trees have extensive surface roots, making it a challenge to grow 
plants underneath them.

Plant shapes
When you’re planning how to use a plant in your garden or landscape, it 
helps to know something about how it grows. A garden filled with tall, narrow 
plants has a very different feel to it than one featuring spreading mounds 
of foliage. The best garden designs usually include plants with a variety of 
shapes:
 
✓ Climbing plants cling or twine around a support as they reach for the 
sky. Without a support, they sprawl on the ground.
 
✓ Upright plants stand tall on their own. Columnar plants are upright plants 
that are especially tall and narrow.
 
✓ Mounding and shrubby plants form rounded cushions.
 
✓ Weeping plants have branches that hang down.

34
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
✓ Prostrate and creeping plants stay close to the ground, and some spread 
themselves around the garden.
 
✓ Pyramidal plants are wide at the base and narrow at the top, while 
vase-shaped plants are narrow at the bottom and wide at the top.
Plant cold and heat hardiness
The ability of a plant to survive is called its hardiness. Plant catalogs often 
use the term rather loosely to indicate whether you can expect a particular 
plant to live in a cold-winter climate, but hardiness really is a measure of a 
plant’s ability to survive all the aspects of a particular climate. For a map of 
U.S. hardiness zones (as well as information about heat zones and sunlight 
zones), head to the later section “Considering your region’s climate.”
Cold hardiness
Many things influence a plant’s cold-hardiness. It helps to think of all the 
factors as links in a chain: The weakest link determines the strength of the 
chain (or, in this case, the hardiness of the plant). Some of the factors have 
to do with the plant itself, including the following:
 
✓ Genetics: The genetic adaptability of plants to specific climates and 
soils is called provenance. Provenance is a major factor to consider in 
choosing landscape trees and shrubs, as well as some perennial plants.
 
✓ Stage of growth: The timing of acclimation, or winter readiness, varies 
with each species and depends partly on growing conditions, such as 
soil moisture and fertility. Soft, new shoots, for example, may suffer 
frost injury in the autumn, whereas woody stems that grew earlier in the 
summer remain undamaged.
 
✓ Health: Environmental stressors — such as drought, flooding, storm 
damage, diseases, and pests — weaken plants and can make them more 
vulnerable to cold damage.
 
✓ Plant parts: Flower buds are often less cold-hardy than the woody 
stems of trees and shrubs, and they may be damaged or killed before 
stem damage occurs. That’s why a late-spring cold snap often kills 
frost-tender flowers but does little harm to other plant parts.
The climate itself also affects plant hardiness. Climatic factors that influence 
plant survival include the following:
 
✓ Duration of winter: Genetic programming signals some plants to 
begin flowering and growing after a particular number of hours of cold 
temperatures followed by warm temperatures. Even before winter really 
ends, some plants — especially those growing outside their preferred 
range — break dormancy (begin growing again) and are damaged by 
spring frost.

35
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Organic Landscape
 
✓ Duration of extreme cold: Prolonged periods of extreme cold usually 
cause more damage than a single night of unusually cold temperatures.
 
✓ Wind: Wind increases moisture loss. Unfortunately, plants can’t 
replace lost moisture while the soil is frozen and plants are dormant. 
Evergreens, which keep their leaves year-round, are especially vulnerable 
to the effects of drying winds in winter.
 
✓ Snow: Snow provides an insulating blanket that protects plant roots 
and stems from extreme cold. In areas that receive little snow, the soil 
temperature gets much colder than in areas with snow cover. (You can 
use a thick layer of loose mulch to mimic the insulating effect of snow.)
 
✓ Sun exposure: The sun can increase moisture loss from winter foliage 
and stems. The winter sun can cause frost cracks: The bark on young 
or thin-barked trees like beech and maples thaws during the day, then 
freezes at sunset, causing the bark to split.
Heat tolerance
Heat tolerance is a common limiting factor for plants, and in many parts 
of the country, this factor — not cold-hardiness — is the primary concern. 
Plants native to desert and tropical regions are naturally heat-tolerant, 
whereas plants from cooler regions may show little tolerance. Some plants 
can withstand high daytime temperatures but suffer if nights stay too warm. 
Sun exposure, humidity, and soil moisture can influence a plant’s ability to 
thrive in a hot climate.
Knowing Your Landscape Conditions
Healthy plants suffer from fewer pest and disease problems, and tolerate 
drought, flood, and other adverse situations more easily than do struggling 
plants, so it makes sense to put plants in the right places to encourage their 
natural resilience. The natural rhythm of the seasons, including the winter 
low temperatures and the summer highs, sets the most obvious limits within 
which you garden. Other, subtler factors — including moisture, nutrients, 
soil, and sun — also influence how and where plants grow best.
Considering your region’s climate
The predominating weather conditions of an area, measured over a long 
period of time, determine a region’s climate. Factors affecting climate include 
seasonal temperatures; humidity; timing, amount, and type of precipitation; 
length of growing season; and wind patterns. Proximity to mountains and 
large bodies of water, distance above sea level, position on the planet relative 
to the equator, and prevailing wind (the direction from which the wind 

36
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
usually blows) also affect climate. The following sections provide a variety of 
hardiness maps — for hardiness zones, heat zones, and sunset times.
 
Don’t use geographic proximity alone to evaluate climate. Two places near 
each other geographically can have very different climates if one is high on 
a mountainside and the other is on the valley floor, for example. Also, widely 
separated regions can have similar climates.
USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map
Low winter temperatures limit where most plants will grow. After compiling 
weather data collected over many years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) divided North America, Europe, and China into 11 zones. Each zone 
represents an expected average annual minimum temperature.
On the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map for North America (see Figure 3-3), 
each of the 11 zones is 10°F warmer or colder in an average winter than the 
adjacent zone. The warmest zone, Zone 11, records an average low annual 
temperature of 40°F or higher. In Zone 1, the lowest average annual tempera-
ture drops to minus 50°F or colder. Brrr!
Zones 2 through 10 on some North American maps are further subdivided 
into a and b regions. The lowest average annual temperature in Zone 5a, for 
example, is 5°F warmer than the temperature in Zone 5b. When choosing 
plants that are just barely hardy in your zone, knowing whether your garden 
falls into the a or b category can ease your decision. After a few years of per-
sonal weather observation in your own garden, you’ll have a pretty clear idea 
of what to expect for winter low temperatures too.
Return of the native (plants, that is)
Native plants are all the rage in gardens across 
the country. A native plant is one that origi-
nated in a particular place and that evolved 
and adapted over millennia alongside the native 
insects, fungi, wildlife, and other plants. This 
longtime association creates a complex web 
of interrelationships, with plants, insects, and 
animals depending on one another for food, 
shelter, pollination, and other needs. Native 
plants are touted as being universally easy 
to grow and beneficial to wildlife. In some 
cases, this description is valid; sometimes, it’s 
just hype.
Some people use native to refer to any plant 
that originates in the United States, but the 
term is better used to link plants with specific 
biomes. A “native” cactus from the deserts 
of the Southwest won’t thrive in the upper 
Midwest, and if it did, the animals and plants 
there would view it as exotic. The cactus is 
native to the Southwestern desert biome, not 
the upper Midwestern biome.
Using an abundance of plants native to your 
region can benefit native insects and wildlife. 
Most states have a native-plant society, which 
is a good place to start your search for true 
native plants: the ones from your biome.

Most books, catalogs, magazines, and plant labels use the USDA zone system. 
For a color version, which may be a bit easier to read, visit the U.S. National 
Arboretum Web site, which offers a map of North America and individual 
regions at www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/index.html.
 
The USDA map is based on a single factor: a region’s average minimum winter 
temperature. Many other factors affect a plant’s ability to thrive in a particular 
environment, so use the map only as a guideline.
AHS Heat Zone Map
To help gardeners in warm climates, the American Horticultural Society 
developed the AHS Heat Zone Map. This map divides the United States into 
12 zones based on the average number of heat days each year — days that 
reach temperatures of 86°F or higher. Zone 1 has fewer than one heat day per 
year; Zone 12 has more than 210.
Order your own color poster of the AHS Heat Zone Map by calling the society 
at (800) 777-7931, ext. 137. Or visit the American Horticulture Society’s Web 
site at www.ahs.org/publications/heat_zone_map.htm for more 
information and a downloadable map. The site also offers a Heat Zone Finder 
to locate your particular heat zone by zip code.
Sunset map
In an attempt to take total climate into consideration when evaluating plant 
hardiness, Sunset Publishing created Sunset’s Garden Climate Zones, a map 
that divides the country into 24 zones. This map is especially useful to 
gardeners in the western United States, where mountains, deserts, and 
coastal areas create wildly diverse climates, sometimes within a few miles 
of each other.
Although most national plant suppliers and references use the USDA 
zone map, regional garden centers and growers in the western half of the 
country often refer to the Sunset map. View it at www.sunset.com/sunset/
garden/article/1,20633,845218,00.html.
Thinking about your microclimates
Within larger climates, smaller pockets exist that differ somewhat from the 
prevailing weather around them. These microclimates occur wherever a 
building, body of water, dense shrubs, or hillside modifies the larger climate.
Microclimates may be very small, such as the sunny side of your house or 
the shady side under a tree, or as large as a village. A town on the shore of 
Lake Michigan has a different microclimate than a town 20 miles inland, for 
example. Common microclimates around your property may include the 
following:

39
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Organic Landscape
 
✓ North side of house: Cool and shady year-round
 
✓ South side of house: Hot and sunny all day; often dry
 
✓ East side of house: Warm morning sun and cool afternoon shade
 
✓ West side of house: Morning shade and hot afternoon sun
 
✓ Top of hill: Exposed to wind and sun; soil dries quickly
 
✓ Bottom of hill: Collects cold air and may be poorly drained due to 
precipitation that runs down the slope
No doubt you can find other examples on your site as you closely observe 
the patterns of sun, water, wind, and temperature throughout the year.
 
Plan your landscape and gardens to take advantage of microclimates. Use 
wind-sheltered areas to protect tender plants from drying winter winds in cold 
climates and hot, dry winds in arid places. Put plants such as phlox and lilac, 
which are prone to leaf disease, in breezy garden spots as a natural way to 
prevent infections. Avoid putting frost-tender plants at the bottoms of hills, 
where pockets of cold air form.
Seasonal sun and shade
When you work out your garden and landscape plans, it helps to know where 
the sun shines and shadows fall at different times of the year. In the summer, 
the sun rises higher in the sky, for example, and casts shadows differently 
than it does in the winter, when it’s lower in the sky. 
Where you live also affects the sun’s intensity. Gardeners in the southern 
latitudes and at higher elevations enjoy stronger sunlight than gardeners 
who live in the north and at lower elevations. Garden books use terms such 
as full sun or part shade to describe where plants grow best, but full sun 
in San Diego, California, is not the same as full sun in Eugene, Oregon, or 
Boulder, Colorado. Plants that grow happily in the sun all day long in Eugene, 
for example, may prefer a little midday shade in sunny Southern California or 
mountain-high Boulder.
 
Figuring out just what kind of sun and shade you have can be confusing. Plant 
descriptions in this book and many others use the following terms:
 
✓ Deep or dense shade occurs on the north sides of buildings and walls, 
and under trees with low branches and dense leaves. No direct sunlight 
reaches the ground.
 
✓ Partial shade occurs in places that receive direct morning or afternoon 
sun, but none at midday, from about 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 
✓ Light shade falls under trees with high branches or sparse foliage.
 
✓ Full sun means direct sunlight for at least six hours each day, including 
some or all of the midday hours.

40
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
Do what I do: Combine sun- and shade-loving plants so that one protects the 
other. In my vegetable garden, for example, I plant leaf-lettuce seeds between 
the broccoli plants because the broccoli shades the sprouting lettuce, which 
prefers cooler, shadier soil.
Water
Your climate determines how much water falls on your garden, and the slope 
of the land and type of soil determine whether that water puddles or runs 
away. But you can also influence what happens to water after it falls from the 
sky or flows out of the faucet by designing your garden and landscape to take 
advantage of natural conditions.
 
In arid climates where rain falls infrequently, you can grow a lush, colorful 
garden and landscape — and conserve water too. Here’s how:
 
✓ Choose plants that naturally thrive with little rainfall in your climate. 
Plant water-hungry exotics sparingly — in containers or as accent 
specimens only. Seek out plant nurseries that specialize in drought-
tolerant species.
 
✓ Protect existing native plants during construction and landscaping 
projects on your property. These plants are naturally adapted to the 
site and require little maintenance. Use them to guide your design plan.
 
✓ Install rain barrels or a cistern to collect and store whatever rain 
does fall. Use this water for your garden instead of drawing on municipal 
services or depleting your well water.
 
✓ Avoid wasteful overhead sprinklers. Use drip irrigation to deliver water 
efficiently and directly to the plant roots through a pipe or hose. 
 
✓ Alter the slope or make channels to direct the surface water, if you 
find that rainfall runs off too quickly. Check local regulations before 
altering any natural wetland or bodies of water, or affecting water flow 
onto a neighboring property.
 
✓ Use ground-covering plants to preserve soil moisture and cool the 
surrounding area. Avoid heat-reflecting mulches and surfaces, which 
can increase plants’ need for water.
Gardeners who regularly deal with too much moisture, which results in plant 
disease, have several options as well. Beyond choosing plants that enjoy 
plenty of water, you can build raised gardens. The soil in a raised garden may 
drain more quickly than the surrounding soil, especially if you add plenty of 
organic material. Find out more about raised beds in Chapter 5. You can also 
install buried drainpipe to carry away excess surface water.

41
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Organic Landscape
Soil conditions
Nothing you do in your garden is more important than building healthy, 
fertile, organically rich soil. Soil does much more than simply hold plants in 
place; it’s also the source of nearly all plant nutrition and water. Many of the 
microorganisms that live in soil benefit plants, too. Soil is so important, in 
fact, that I devote two entire chapters to the subject. Flip to Chapter 4 for an 
overview of soils and to Chapter 5 for soil-building techniques.
Getting Started on Your Garden Design
You can find hundreds of garden design books and Web sites, but often, 
the best place to start planning a design is your neighborhood. What yards 
strike your fancy as you drive by? Visit public gardens in your region; they’re 
ideal for getting ideas about plants that thrive in your climate. Keep a small 
camera with you, and snap shots of plant groupings and color combinations 
that you’d like to replicate in your landscape. Tear pages out of magazines 
and catalogs, and start a scrapbook.
 
As you plan your organic landscape, keep the following tips in mind:
 
✓ Plan for convenience. Common-sense design features can make garden 
tasks easier. Make sure that fence openings are wide enough for a lawn 
mower or wheelbarrow, for example. If you’re creating a new garden, 
install soaker hoses or drip irrigation at planting time, the easiest time 
to tackle that task.
 
✓ Plan for diversity. Choosing plants in a range of types, sizes, colors, and 
shapes makes for a more interesting landscape; encourages wildlife and 
beneficial organisms; and minimizes pest problems. See the earlier 
section “Factors Affecting Your Design Decisions” for more info.
 
✓ Plan for low maintenance. Minimize gardening chores with careful 
planning. Choose hardy, reliable, easy-care plants. Make sure that the 
mature sizes of trees and shrubs are appropriate to the site so that 
you’ll have to do little pruning. Use easy-care ground covers in place of 
high-maintenance lawns.
 
✓ Plan for sustainability. Think long-term when designing your gardens; 
consider how plantings will look in five or ten years. (Visit botanical 
gardens to view mature specimens.) Choose well-adapted, long-lived 
plants that require minimal supplemental water and fertilizer. Minimize 
the need for outside sources of fertilizer by composting yard and 
kitchen waste.

42
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
✓ Plan for abundance. Think about how your landscape will look in all 
four seasons, and include plants that will provide interest year-round. 
Consider all the things gardens can provide. Add a cutting garden for 
indoor bouquets; plant extra herbs for drying; add gourds and berry-
filled shrubs for crafts. Install a cold frame and have fresh produce from 
early spring to late fall.
 
✓ Plan for energy conservation. Strategically placed shade trees help 
keep your house cool in summer. Proper landscaping can reduce 
heating and cooling costs by one third or more. (For details, see 
“Landscaping for energy conservation,” later in this chapter.)
 
Before you start planning, check local regulations and community covenants 
for restrictions on things like grass height and types of plants allowed. Some 
homeowners’ associations prohibit vegetable gardens or allow them only in 
backyards, for example. If you find the rules objectionable, persuade others in 
your neighborhood to join you in attempting to have them revoked.
Basic design principles for your garden
Mixing and matching plants with creative flair is the part of gardening that 
gets me excited every winter, when seed and plant catalogs land in my mail-
box, and when the soil warms in the spring. Whether you’re designing a new 
landscape or just adding or rearranging existing plants, keep the following 
design elements in mind:
 
✓ Season of bloom: A big mistake that many gardeners make is buying 
only what they see blooming in the garden center in the spring. Their 
gardens end up looking lovely in spring and early summer but lack inter-
est during the rest of the year.
 
✓ Color: Gardeners usually make flower color their top priority when 
deciding which plants to purchase, but the color of foliage and bark can 
also add to a garden’s overall palette. Consider that many plants bloom 
for only a few weeks, but you see their foliage and bark at other times 
of year. Sometimes, the most beautiful gardens have the simplest color 
schemes. A garden filled with white flowers and silvery-gray foliage, for 
example, shimmers in the moonlight.
 
✓ Scale: Look for trees and shrubs that complement the scale of your 
landscape. A huge tree can overwhelm a small yard; a small shrub can 
look lost in an expanse of lawn. Keep scale in mind in individual gardens, 
too. You may want to arrange plants by height, putting the shortest ones 
in the front and the tallest in the back. For gardens that will be viewed 
from all sides, put the tallest plants in the middle.

43
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Organic Landscape
 
✓ Season-extending attributes: Some plants offer good-looking seedpods, 
buds, bark, or growth habits. Poppy seed heads, ornamental grass seed 
heads, curly willow stems, red osier dogwood shoots, and river birch 
bark take center stage when foliage and flowers have faded. Plants with 
an extra-long blooming period or that bloom twice in a season, such as 
reblooming bearded irises, offer good garden value.
 
✓ Growth habit: Growth habit can make a particular plant more or less 
suitable for a garden. Climbing vines, for example, they take up little 
room in the garden and give an extra vertical dimension to the space. 
Trailing plants, such as creeping thyme and petunia, carpet the ground.
 
✓ Cultural considerations: Look for disease-resistant varieties, especially 
in species that are vulnerable to particular problems. Phlox, for exam-
ple, is prone to powdery mildew, but many newer varieties resist the 
fungus. Look for “disease-resistant” in the descriptions of all plants, but 
especially for roses, fruit trees, vegetables, and berries.
Types of landscape arrangements
Landscaping can be so much more than just making your yard beautiful. 
Many plants can serve double duty. For example, a fruit tree planted so it 
shades your porch will help keep you cool while you savor its delicious 
fruits. When planning your landscape, consider all the ways in which plants 
can enhance your daily life.
Designing with color
Although you really can’t go wrong in mixing 
flower colors, some hues naturally go well 
together. Color wheels, which you can find in 
the local art supply store, show the rainbow as 
a circle of colored slices. Color-wheel oppo-
sites — such as red and green, orange and 
blue, purple and yellow — complement each 
other. Colors that form triangles on the color 
wheel — such as blue, green–yellow, and red–
purple — also make good combinations. A 
single hue (such as red) has many lighter and 
darker colors (such as pink and deep red) within 
its family, and combining these hues make 
single-color-theme gardens more interesting.
Hot colors — red, yellow, and orange — jump 
out in the landscape and can appear to be 
closer than they are. Cool colors — blue, green, 
and purple — blend into the garden and look 
farther away. Use these colors to achieve 
certain effects. Cool colors in a small garden 
can make it appear larger; hot colors draw 
more attention to streetside plantings. White 
also stands out in the landscape, especially 
in dim light, and is useful for planting with 
more-colorful flowers to brighten or moderate 
the mix.

Landscaping for energy conservation
 
Before the advent of cheap and readily accessible heating and air condition-
ing, people used common-sense landscaping to increase the comfort of their 
homes and to reduce heating and cooling costs. A well-planned landscape can 
reduce a home’s summer air-conditioning costs by 15 percent to 50 percent. 
Windbreaks can save up to 25 percent on heating costs. Here are a few energy-
conservation tips:
 
✓ Plant deciduous trees on the southeast and southwest corners of your 
house. They’ll shade your home from summer sun but shed their leaves 
in the fall so that the warmth of the winter sun can reach your home. 
Note: Trees on the south side of the house won’t provide much cooling 
in midsummer unless they overhang the roof. Because they block winter 
sunlight in that position, it’s usually best to leave the south side treeless.
 
✓ Plant an evergreen hedge on the north or northwest side of the house 
(or whichever side is the direction of the prevailing winter winds) to 
provide a buffer from cold gusts.
 
✓ Plant trees to shade an air-conditioning unit, thereby increasing the 
unit’s efficiency by 10 percent or more. Trim away foliage around the 
unit to ensure good air circulation.
 
✓ Plant annual or deciduous vines on south-facing exterior walls to 
help insulate them from hot summer sun. They’ll die back or lose their 
leaves in the fall, letting winter sun reach the walls. Grow vines to shade 
sunrooms and porches, too.
 
Some municipalities offer financial incentives to homeowners who use water-
conserving landscape plants. Consult your local conservation commission, 
community conservation district, or state department of natural resources to 
see whether such a program exists in your area.
An integrated landscape
It’s time to rethink the suburban landscape paradigm: a house surrounded by 
symmetrical evergreen foundation plants; a huge manicured lawn punctuated 
by occasional flower beds; a vegetable garden relegated to a corner of the 
backyard.
As an organic gardener, you’re uniquely positioned to create integrated 
landscapes in which edibles and ornamentals share garden space. Why? You 
don’t have to worry about pesticides sprayed on lawns and flowers contami-
nating your food plants. Why not use blueberry bushes as foundation plants? 
They’re attractive and low maintenance, and the foliage turns a beautiful 
crimson in fall. Best of all, you can step out your door to a harvest of juicy 
berries. Rainbow Swiss chard, which has striking orange, pink, red, and 
yellow stems, is a natural in flower beds and offers a nutritious harvest, too.

 Chapter 3: Planning Your Organic Landscape
 
It’s okay to know the rules of traditional garden design, but it’s just as 
important to know that you can break them!
Putting pencil to paper
Good designers observe and discover how the different parts of the land-
scape — home, gardens, and other functional areas of a site — relate to 
one another, and they use those relationships to direct their designs. Think 
through each of the following items as completely as you can, using plenty of 
paper to take notes and scribble ideas:
 
✓ What you want from your landscape: Your list may include a vegetable 
garden, herb patch, flowers for bouquets, fruit trees or shrubs, compost 
bin, tool storage, and recycling bins.
 
✓ How the different items in your list relate to one another: Consider the 
distance between places that depend on each other. Does it make more 
sense to put the vegetable garden at the far corner of the backyard or 
close to the kitchen and tool-storage area in the garage?
 
✓ How often you will visit each area: Places that you visit daily, such as 
the trash, compost, and vegetable garden, should be located closest 
to the house. An area that needs infrequent maintenance, such as an 
orchard, can be situated farther away.
 
✓ How many functions each element can fulfill: Trees can provide shade, 
fruit, ornament, and windbreak, among other things. Vegetable gardens 
can be ornamental and also provide food. Flowers attract hummingbirds, 
color the yard, furnish garnish for salads and bouquets for the table, and 
provide habitat for beneficial insects.
When you’re done brainstorming your list, you’re ready to draw up a plan 
that makes sense on the ground.
Making a map
One of the most important ways that organic gardeners encourage healthy, 
pest-resistant plants is to plant them where they can naturally thrive. But you 
have to know something about your site before you can match the plants to 
their right places. Grab a buddy, the longest tape measure you own or can 
borrow, and a pencil and paper; then head outside. The next sections lead 
you through a quick-and-dirty mapmaking exercise.

46
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
Step 1: Sketch the major features of your property
Start by drawing the outlines of major features of your property, including 
buildings and property lines. Use your tape measure and do your best to 
draw to scale, with everything in the correct proportion to everything else, 
but don’t agonize: Neatness doesn’t count.
 
For long distances, measure the length of your stride, and multiply it by the 
number of strides it takes you to get from one end to the other.
Sketch the locations of important rooms, windows, and exterior doors of 
your house. Remember to note permanent features, such as the driveway, 
paths, deck, and shed. Note the location of water spigots and electrical 
outlets. Make an arrow on your map to indicate the direction of north; you’ll 
need that information as you plan your garden.
Step 2: Note natural features
Add the following natural features to your map:
 
✓ Sun and shade: Label the sunny and shady spots around your yard so 
that you can take advantage of them. If you have lived in the house long 
enough, note the sun and shade at different times of the day and year.
 
✓ Views: If you plan to do some landscaping, note the nice and not-so-nice 
views around your property. Remember to check the views from your 
windows, too.
 
✓ Soil, slope, and water: Draw arrows on your map that point down 
slopes. Circle areas where water pools or runs after a rainstorm. Note 
places where your soil stays muddy or drains quickly.
 
✓ Wind: Note the direction and strength of the prevailing winds across 
your site at different times of the year.
 
✓ Existing plants and natural features: Use circles to draw existing trees 
and shrubs that you intend to keep. Record the width of the plant 
canopy by measuring from one edge of the drip line (where rain drips 
from the foliage to the ground) to the other. Note the locations and sizes 
of gardens, large rocks, and other features you want to preserve.
Your map may resemble the one shown in Figure 3-4 when you’re done. 
Resist the temptation to add “things to do” to this map at this stage; save 
that task for the following section.

Putting it all together
Here’s where your dreams meet reality. The idea is to take your list of proj-
ects and match them to the most appropriate places in your yard. For this 
project, lay tracing paper over your map or make a bunch of photocopies so 
that you can doodle ideas at will without messing up the original. As you try 
out different combinations and placements, keep the following tips in mind:
 
✓ Prioritize your list of desires. Put them into a time frame or order of 
steps. You may have to build a deer-excluding fence before planting an 
orchard or vegetable garden, for example, and preparing soil comes 
before planting.
 
✓ Think long-term. Some tasks take a day to accomplish; other projects 
stretch out for months or even years. Break long projects into shorter, 
prioritized steps.

48
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Organic Gardening 
 
✓ Concentrate on the areas closest to the house first. Put your most 
intensive gardens and use areas near the house, and plan to install them 
before you tackle the outlying areas.
 
✓ Conserve energy. Use gravity, sun, shade, wind, and precipitation to 
your advantage. It’s easier to move a barrel of water or a cart of compost 
downhill than uphill, for example. Note the places where soil warms up 
first in the spring, and plant your early-season vegetables there.
 
✓ Consider maintenance. Decide how much time you can realistically 
devote to maintaining your gardens and landscape plants, and plan 
accordingly. Don’t sketch in a 400-square-foot vegetable garden if you 
have only enough time to weed and harvest a garden half that size.
 
✓ Think multipurpose. Make plants and built-in features serve more than 
one function. Use a fence or plants to support an ornamental or food-
producing vine, screen an unpleasant view, prevent trespassing, enclose 
a private space, and deflect wind.
 
✓ Play matchmaker. Make a list of plants that you want to grow. Next to 
each one, write down whether it needs full sun, part shade, or shade. In 
another column, note soil and moisture preferences. Group plants with 
similar needs, and look at the places on your map where each group 
would be happiest.
 
✓ Avoid obstacles. Put trees, shrubs, and perennial plants where they will 
have room to mature. If you have overhead utility lines, avoid planting 
trees under or near them. Choose shrubs that won’t cover the windows 
of your house, and plant them so that they won’t rub on the siding in 
five or ten years.
Now, with your plan in hand, it’s time to dig in!

R
eady to get down and dirty? This part is the heart 
of the book, because healthy soil is where organic 
gardening — and healthy plants — begin.
Chapter 4 explains why soil is more than just dirt. 
Healthy soil contains minerals, organic matter, and the 
proper amount of air and water. It’s also teeming with 
microorganisms that help the soil support your garden 
plants.
Chapter 5 gives you the tools to evaluate the soil you 
have and good ideas about how to improve it. Compost is 
king in this chapter, and I get up close and personal with 
manure, too (whew!). Flip to Chapter 6 for the lowdown 
on fertilizers that come from plants, animals, and minerals,
and find out how to use them.

Chapter 4

Surface: Soils 101
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know soil components
▶ Understanding soil fertility
▶ Recognizing the importance of pH
S
oil may not be the most exciting part of gardening, but it’s the foundation 
upon which you build everything else. Healthy soil is alive; it’s the most 
biologically diverse habitat on Earth. A shovelful of rich garden soil contains 
more species of organisms than you can find aboveground in the entire 
Amazon rain forest!
What do all those organisms do? They feed on and decompose organic 
matter and release nutrients for plants to use. Beneficial microorganisms 
in the soil prey on harmful ones and protect plant roots from diseases and 
pests. Earthworms and other soil creatures tunnel through the soil, opening 
spaces for oxygen, water, and nutrients to move freely.
Organic gardeners and farmers encourage this beneficial soil life and improve 
their soil by adding organic matter, such as compost; by using practices that 
prevent damage to the soil habitat; and by avoiding synthetic pesticides and 
fertilizers that destroy subterranean life. To join their ranks, first you need to 
know what you’re dealing with. This chapter has the details.
Soil Components: The Nitty-Gritty
The first step toward improving your soil is understanding what it’s made of. 
If you dig down deeply into the soil, you can see that it’s composed of layers, 
called horizons, as shown in Figure 4-1. These layers are, from the bottom up:

52
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
 
✓ Parent rock: About half the volume of most soils consists of small 
mineral pieces that originate in the underlying parent rock. The 
composition of the parent rock partly determines the type of soil you 
have; sandstone parent rock yields sandy soil, for example. Impervious 
parent rock can lead to poorly drained soils, whereas porous or highly 
fractured parent rock usually contributes to good drainage.
 
✓ Subsurface soil (subsoil): This layer is mineral-rich and largely undisturbed 
by cultivation and weather. Subsoils contain little organic matter and 
few microorganisms. Sometimes, a hard, impervious layer called caliche 
or hardpan forms in the subsoil; it prevents water from draining properly.
 
✓ Surface soil: This layer, also called topsoil, lies above the subsoil, where 
plows, gardeners, and weather can alter it. Most plant roots and soil 
microorganisms live in the surface soil. In addition to small mineral 
pieces, topsoil contains organic matter, air, and water. The proper
balance of these components is vital to the health of garden plants.

 Chapter 4: Digging beneath the Surface: Soils 101
It has been said that a nation endures only as long as its topsoil. Without 
topsoil, little plant life is possible, and without plants, no animals survive. 
During the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, hundreds of millions of tons of topsoil 
blew off the land in the southern Great Plains, in part because the deep-
rooted native prairie grasses had been replaced by farm fields. It takes 500 
years or more for nature to create 1 inch of topsoil from subsoil.
 
Preserving and improving soil are among the tenets of organic growing. You 
can’t change the type of parent rock in your garden, but you can improve your 
soil. Most improvement efforts focus on the topsoil, but if this layer is thin, 
you may need to extend your efforts to the subsoil layer. Find out more about 
building healthy soil in Chapter 5.
Digging into the Topsoil
As I mention earlier in this chapter, the health of garden plants depends on 
the soil having the proper balance of mineral pieces, organic matter, air, and 
water (see Figure 4-2). Understanding the nature of topsoil is key to improving 
it, and knowing what type of soil you have can help you choose techniques to 
enhance its good qualities.

Composition of soil
About half the volume of most soils consists of clay, silt, and sand particles, 
which differ in size and shape (see Figure 4-3). The relative amounts of these 
particles determine your soil texture:
 
✓ Clay particles, the smallest soil particles, are microscopic and flat.
 
✓ Silt particles are more angular and larger than clay but still microscopic.
 
✓ Sand particles are the largest of the three types. They can be angular or 
rounded.

The spaces between soil particles are called pores. Nutrient-rich water moves 
through these pores, as does the air that roots and microorganisms depend 
on. When the soil contains very little pore space, water and air can’t move 
through the soil. When it has too much pore space, water passes through too 
quickly.

55
 Chapter 4: Digging beneath the Surface: Soils 101
For most plants, the ideal mixture is approximately 40 percent sand, 40 percent 
silt, and 20 percent clay. Soil with this makeup is called loam. Loamy soil is 
ideal because it provides a balance of water-holding capacity, drainage, and 
fertility. Alas, not all soils are loamy. Those composed of mostly one particle 
type can pose challenges for gardeners:
 
✓ Clay soils are naturally fertile, but they can be difficult to work. Clay 
soil’s individual particles are so small and flat that they pack tightly, 
leaving little room for water and air. On a practical level, this structure 
means that clay soil drains poorly, stays wet longer than other soils, 
contains little oxygen, and dries as hard as concrete. A wet spring may 
mean a delay in planting; a dry summer causes the soil to crack and 
harden.
 
✓ Silt soils have moderate fertility and medium-size particles and pore 
spaces that hold some water and air. Like clay soils, they can pack 
tightly, especially when wet. They may get powdery or dusty when dry. 
Silt particles are easily carried away by runoff and are small enough to 
be blown away by wind.
 
✓ Sandy soils contain few nutrients. Sand particles are large; water drains 
quickly from the pore spaces, and any nutrients that are present tend to 
leach out. Sandy soils don’t pack tightly like clay and silt soils.
Unfortunately, except by trucking in huge amounts of soil, you have no way 
to change your soil’s texture. You can take advantage of its natural assets, 
however, and compensate for its challenges by working on the soil structure.
Soil structure
The way that the soil particles align themselves or clump together is called 
soil structure. The best garden soils have a loose, crumblike structure that 
water, air, and plant roots can penetrate easily. Unstructured soils, such as 
beach sand, don’t clump together, which allows water to flow through them 
too rapidly for most plant growth. Poorly structured soils, such as heavy clay, 
clump together so tightly that little water and air can pass through.
Two of the most important goals for organic gardeners are improving 
and maintaining good soil structure. Improving soil structure can improve 
water-holding capacity in sandy soils and improve drainage in clay soils.
 
Many things affect soil structure, but the most important ones from a 
gardener’s point of view include the following:

56
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
 
✓ Organic matter: Decayed plants and animals become humus, a substance 
that helps soil particles bind together into crumblike aggregates. Soils 
that lack enough humus may clump together too tightly or not at all. 
Adding organic matter improves the structure of both sandy and clay 
soils. To find out how to add organic matter, head to Chapter 5.
 
✓ Soil organisms: As they tunnel through the soil, earthworms, beetles, 
and other organisms open spaces between soil particles, allowing air, 
water, and roots to pass through easily. Earthworm castings (excrement) 
are also rich in nutrients. Encourage these beneficial soil organisms by 
providing food and habitat for them in the form of organic matter.
 
✓ Rotary-tilling: Churning the soil through rotary-tiller blades is a good 
way to break up compact soils and mix in organic matter. Rotary-tilling 
(also called rototilling or just tilling) also changes the soil structure.
 
 Although tilling can initially add more air to the soil, be careful not to 
overtill. Overtilling pulverizes soil aggregates, damages soil life, and 
promotes too-rapid breakdown and loss of organic matter. Find out 
more about rototilling in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Working with wet soil: Avoid walking on, digging in, or rototilling 
saturated soil. Wet soil, especially clay, packs together tightly when 
compressed, forming clods that can bake to potterylike hardness in hot 
sun. Allow garden soil to drain to the dampness of a wrung-out sponge 
before working in it. Find out about building raised beds to improve 
drainage and minimize soil compaction in Chapter 5.
 
Improving and maintaining soil structure is an ongoing process no matter 
what type of soil you have. Adding organic matter to your soil every year is an 
important step, particularly for sandy or clay soils. Organic matter acts like a 
glue to help sandy soils stick together into aggregates that retain the proper 
amount of moisture. It also helps clay soils drain better by binding with the 
tiny particles to create larger ones with more pore space. But even healthy, 
loamy soils benefit from annual additions of organic matter. Organic matter is 
vital to soil structure, but it also contributes to soil fertility. Head to the later 
section “Organic matter” for more information.
Starting from Fertile Ground
If you feed the soil, the soil will feed the plants. For organic gardeners, feeding 
plants isn’t just a matter of pouring on the fertilizer. Instead, gardeners build 
the natural fertility of their soil by adding organic matter, preserving and 
improving the soil structure, and modifying the soil pH. (Fertility is the 
capacity of a soil to supply the mineral nutrients that plants need.) Several 
factors influence soil fertility, as the following sections explain.

57
 Chapter 4: Digging beneath the Surface: Soils 101
Amount of nutrients in the soil
Overall, plants need 16 elements, or nutrients, for proper growth. Different 
soils contain differing levels of these needed elements. When enough of each 
element is present, plants grow optimally. If even one element is in short 
supply, plants can’t grow as well. Think of the weakest-link theory, which 
says that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Your soil is only as 
fertile as its most deficient nutrient.
Nutrients for photosynthesis
The nutrients that plants need in the largest quantities are carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen, which plants use for photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, 
green plants take these nutrients from the air and from the water in the soil 
to produce sugars — the “food” that fuels plant growth.
Mineral nutrients
Plants generally get mineral nutrients from the soil or from applied fertilizers. 
Mineral nutrients include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (the familiar 
N-P-K on fertilizer bags), as well as numerous others. When gardeners talk 
about feeding plants, they’re talking about providing them with extra mineral 
nutrients.
 
The term feeding is a bit of a misnomer because plants produce their own 
food — carbohydrates — during photosynthesis. These mineral nutrients 
(nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and others) are more akin to the vitamins 
we take to supplement our food.
The mineral nutrients needed in the largest quantities are called macronutrients 
and consist of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and 
sulfur. In addition, plants need smaller amounts of so-called micronutrients. 
The eight micronutrients considered essential for plant growth are iron, 
manganese, boron, copper, zinc, molybdenum, chlorine, and nickel, all of 
which occur in very small quantities in most soils. These micronutrients, and 
other substances found in low concentrations in soils, are sometimes called 
trace elements. Scientists studying plant nutrition may discover additional 
micronutrients among the many trace elements in soils.
 
Plants may take up trace elements that they don’t need — but that we humans 
do. The trace elements iodine, fluorine, selenium, cobalt, arsenic, lithium, 
chromium, silicon, tin, and vanadium, for example, are considered to be 
essential for animals and humans but not for plants. Brazil nuts usually 
contain large amounts of selenium, which has no known nutritional value to 
plants but which is an important antioxidant for human health. The level of 
selenium in plants varies due to the selenium content in the soil.

58
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
Because they are derived from natural sources, many organic fertilizers contain 
an abundance of trace elements, including important plant micronutrients. 
Synthetic fertilizers, on the other hand, often contain just nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium, so they don’t replenish or enhance the other nutrients and 
trace elements. Researchers still have much to discover about soil and the 
interplay among minerals, organic matter, soil life, and plant health, so it 
makes sense to choose fertilizers and other soil additives that supply a broad 
range of nutrients. What’s certain is that plant — and human — health depends 
on healthy soil.
For more on plant nutrients and building soil fertility, see Chapter 5. Look in 
Chapter 6 for a rundown on organic fertilizers.
Soil particles
The kinds and relative amounts of soil particles you have in your garden 
soil also affect its fertility. Clay and silt soils tend to hold more nutrients 
than sand soils do because they have larger surface areas and smaller pore 
spaces. Sandy soil drains quickly, washing nutrients away. Improving soil 
structure — the way individual soil particles bind together — can improve 
fertility. For more information on soil texture and structure, refer to “Soil 
Components: The Nitty-Gritty,” earlier in this chapter.
Organic matter
Organic matter is simply plant and animal matter that is dead and in the 
process of decay. For gardeners, the most important sources include grass 
clippings, leaves, hay, straw, pine needles, wood chips, sawdust, and manure. 
As organic matter decomposes, soil microorganisms consume and break 
down the material, releasing the nutrients it contains into the soil in forms 
that plants can use.
 
Want easy and environmentally friendly ways to add organic matter to your 
garden (a task you should do every year)? Try the following:
 
✓ Till compost into vegetable gardens
 
✓ Leave grass clippings on the lawn
 
✓ Apply wood-chip mulch to perennial beds
As the organic matter decomposes, it feeds soil organisms, which in turn feed 
plants. Because organic matter is consumed, it must be replaced regularly. 
For more information on organic matter, see Chapter 5.

59
 Chapter 4: Digging beneath the Surface: Soils 101
Soil pH
The pH of a soil affects the forms that nutrients take. pH is the measure of a 
liquid’s acidity or alkalinity. The pH scale runs from 1 to 14, with 7 being 
neutral. Anything below 7 is considered to be acidic; anything above 7 is 
alkaline. If soil is too acidic or too alkaline, nutrients may be present but 
bound up in compounds unavailable to plants.
Depending on the pH of water in the soil, nutrients form different compounds, 
some of which plants can’t use. Phosphorus, for example, becomes less 
available for plants at a pH level below 6 and above 7. No matter how much 
phosphorus the soil actually contains, plants can’t use it if the pH is too high 
or low. The ideal soil pH for most plants is between about 6 and 7. Regions 
with high rainfall tend to have acidic soils; in dry regions, the soil tends to be 
alkaline. See Chapter 5 to learn how to determine your soil’s pH and modify 
it, if necessary, for optimum plant growth.
pH facts
The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning that 
values increase (or decrease) exponentially. 
Therefore, a liquid with a pH of 5 is ten times 
more acidic than one with a pH of 6; a liquid 
with a pH of 4 is 100 times more acidic than one 
with a pH of 6.
Soil isn’t the only substance that has a pH value.

Building Healthy Soil

▶ Understanding the type of soil you have
▶ Adjusting the pH and nutrient levels
▶ Getting in touch with organic matter
▶ Making compost
▶ Working the soil
O
rganic gardeners know that if you feed the soil, the soil will feed the 
plants. Healthy soil supports an abundance of living organisms, includ-
ing bacteria, fungi, and earthworms, that together create a dynamic soil eco-
system. Many synthetic pesticides and fertilizers destroy this subterranean 
life, and poor gardening practices can damage the soil environment. The 
organic techniques described in this chapter will help you improve and main-
tain a healthy soil environment. Don’t treat your soil like dirt!
Knowing Your Soil
Like the aboveground ecosystem of your garden, the underground ecosystem 
in the soil needs nurturing. Soil improvement isn’t a one-time deal; it’s an 
ongoing process of promoting the beneficial organisms your plants depend on.
In the wild, soil life is sustained and nutrients are recycled through natural 
processes. Microorganisms, earthworms, and other decomposers feed on 
organic matter and transform the nutrients it contains into forms that plants 
can use. The process is a slow, steady, ongoing one: Plants grow, die, and 
decompose; the cycle continues.
If you maintain tidy perennial beds or harvest crops from your vegetable 
garden, you change this natural dynamic. By raking up fallen leaves or picking 
produce, you’re removing organic matter — and the nutrients it contains — 
from the garden environment. To keep soil healthy, you must put some back, 
which may mean mulching flower beds with bark mulch or adding compost to 

62
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
vegetable gardens. Most of the soil-building techniques I discuss in this 
chapter center on nurturing beneficial soil life and maintaining this dynamic 
underground ecosystem.
The first step to improving your soil is knowing what kind of soil you have. 
Different soils have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to 
supporting plant life. The proper soil-building techniques depend on your 
soil’s fundamental characteristics, such as its water-holding capacity and pH.
Testing your soil type: Sand, silt, or clay?
So how do you know what type of soil you have? Take a small amount of 
damp soil in your hand, as shown in Figure 5-1, and rub a pinch of it between 
your thumb and index finger. If the soil feels gritty, it’s mostly sand; if it feels 
slick and slimy, it’s mostly clay. If you can form a cylinder, but the material 
starts to crumble as you roll it, it’s mostly silt.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Testing 
your soil by 
squeezing 
a clump in 
your hand.
 
For a more accurate measurement of the amounts of clay, silt, and sand in 
your soil, use the jar test. Here’s how:
 
1. Collect soil from several places in your garden and mix the samples 
thoroughly.
 
2. Measure 1 cup of the mixture and remove stones and debris.
 
3. Place the soil in a narrow glass jar (such as a pint canning jar), then 
fill the jar about two-thirds full of water.
 
4. Seal the jar, and shake it vigorously to mix the contents. Set it down, 
and start a timer.
 
5. After one minute, measure and mark the level of settled soil. This 
layer is sand.

63
 Chapter 5: Building Healthy Soil
 
6. Measure again in two hours, and subtract the sand layer to find the 
amount of silt.
 
7. After several days, measure again, and subtract the sand and silt to 
find the amount of clay.
 
8. Divide the height of each level by the total height of the settled soil, 
and multiply by 100 to find the percentage of each component.
 
 If the total settled soil is 6 inches high and the sand portion is 3 inches, 
for example, the sand content is 50 percent (3 ÷ 6 × 100 = 50%)
Testing for drainage
Knowing how well your soil drains helps you determine what to plant, or if 
you need to take steps to improve drainage. Sometimes, drainage conditions 
are obvious. Puddles in your lawn a day or two after heavy rains indicate 
poor drainage, for example. But a layer of clay may lurk underneath a loamy 
or sandy soil, causing water to linger in otherwise well-drained soil. So before 
you plant, especially trees and shrubs, dig a hole to see what lies beneath the 
surface.
Here’s how to check for percolation, or soil drainage:
 
1. Dig a hole 1 foot in diameter and 1 foot deep.
 
2. Fill the hole with water.
 
3. Time how long it takes for the water to drain.
If the water drains out within 10 minutes or less, your soil drains too fast and 
probably dries too quickly. In well-drained soils, the water drains within 10 to 
30 minutes. If it drains within four hours, the drainage is okay for most plants. 
If it takes more than four hours, the soil is poorly drained.
Use this information to choose the most appropriate plants for your soil. 
Keep in mind that adding organic matter, such as compost, to the soil can 
improve the drainage of both sandy and clayey soils (see “Adding Organic 
Matter: The Soul of the Soil,” later in this chapter).
Testing for pH and nutrients
You need to know your soil’s pH and nutrient levels. The soil pH measures 
the alkalinity (sweetness) or acidity (sourness) of the soil. It’s important 
to know whether your soil is acidic (below pH 7 on a scale from 0 to 14) or 
alkaline (above pH 7), because some nutrients are available to plants only 
within a specific pH range.

64
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
A simple rule is that if your plants are growing, flowering, and fruiting well, 
the nutrient levels are fine. A high or low pH or unbalanced nutrient levels, 
on the other hand, can result in yellow, stunted, and unproductive plants. 
Unhealthy plants are more prone to insects and disease attacks, translating 
into more work for you and less satisfaction from your garden. That’s not 
what you want!
Testing on your own or sending a sample to the lab
Home test kits give you a basic pH reading and an estimation of the major 
nutrients in your soil. Nurseries and garden centers sell test kits ranging from 
extremely simple to elaborate. The more sophisticated tests cost more but 
give you more accurate results.
You can also send a soil sample to a lab for testing. The nutrient level and 
pH test results are more accurate and detailed than those provided by home 
kits. In addition, testing labs can look for things that home kits can’t, such 
as organic matter and micronutrients, as well as heavy metals and other 
industrial residues. (Soils near heavily traveled roads or on old industrial 
sites can contain chemicals and metals that you may want to know about 
before planting a vegetable garden.)
Lab reports also offer specific recommendations about which nutrients to 
add to your soil (and in what quantity) for your plants’ optimum growth. 
Many state-university extension services offer free or low-cost soil test kits. 
To find the extension office nearest you, consult the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service 
Web site at www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension.
 
The soil ecosystem changes constantly, so a soil test is just a snapshot of your 
soil at the time you gather the sample. Although the soil pH and many nutrient 
levels are relatively stable, other nutrient levels (such as nitrogen) can change 
forms depending on precipitation, temperature, and crop cover. Use your soil 
test results as guidelines, but focus on building a healthy ecosystem rather 
than on simply adding nutrients.
Your soil’s pH results
Most plants grow best in a pH range between 6 and 7, with 6.5 to 6.8 considered 
ideal. Some plants, however, such as blueberries and rhododendrons, like a 
highly acid soil (pH below 5), so you may need to adjust the pH to individual 
plants.
Generally, soils in areas with low rainfall often are alkaline; those in high-
rainfall areas usually are acidic because rain leaches calcium from the soil. 
To paint a broad stroke, if you live east of the Mississippi River, you probably 
have acidic soil; if you live in the arid Western states, your soil is probably 
alkaline. Testing your soil to be sure is a good idea, however.

65
 Chapter 5: Building Healthy Soil
Nutrient test results
A soil test also shows the quantities of soil nutrients that are available to 
plants, especially the three nutrients that plants use in the greatest amounts: 
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Soils also contain many other nutri-
ents, such as magnesium and calcium, that plants need in smaller amounts. If 
any nutrient is insufficient, plants don’t grow to their maximum potential.
 
Soil test recommendations may not follow organic principles. They may sug-
gest, for example, that you add specific synthetic fertilizers to boost certain 
nutrient levels. You may need to look for organic alternatives to provide these 
nutrients.
Adjusting your pH
If your soil is too acidic, you’ll need to add lime to raise the pH. The term 
lime, or limestone, refers to crushed calcium carbonate (calcite or calcitic 
limestone) rock. Soils that test low in magnesium benefit from dolomitic 
limestone (calcium–magnesium carbonate). The finer the dust, the faster it 
dissolves and begins to raise soil pH.
Look for pelleted lime, which consists of very finely ground limestone formed 
into easy-to-apply pellets. Avoid slaked or hydrated lime, which acts so 
quickly that it can harm soil life. How much lime you need to add depends on 
the type of soil you have and its current pH. The soil-testing lab will make a 
specific recommendation based on that information.
If you have alkaline soil, applying sulfur will lower the pH. Usually, the best 
product to use is 100 percent finely ground sulfur, sometimes called elemen-
tal sulfur. Soil bacteria convert sulfur to sulfuric acid, which lowers the soil 
pH. Again, soil-testing lab results offer guidelines.
 
When adding lime or sulfur to your soil, be sure to wear gloves and a dust 
mask, because the material can be very dusty and irritating if inhaled. You 
can spread the material by hand or use a drop spreader made to spread grass 
seed on a lawn. In the garden, work the lime or sulfur into the top few inches 
of soil with a rake or shovel after spreading.
Don’t expect results from the addition of lime or sulfur right away. Most lime-
stone or powdered sulfur products take a few months to react with the soil 
enough to change the pH to the desired levels — another good reason to pre-
pare your soil a season before you plan to plant.

Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
Adding Organic Matter: 
The Soul of the Soil
“Organic matter” is the mantra of the organic gardener and farmer. It’s the 
soul of the soil and a universal component of healthy earth. Organic matter 
basically is dead plant and animal stuff: grass clippings, leaves, hay, straw, 
pine needles, wood chips, sawdust, manure, and anything else that used to 
be alive. It’s a miracle worker that improves soil in several vital ways:
 
✓ Feeds microorganisms and other soil life: Beneficial bacteria, protozoa, 
fungi, beneficial nematodes, and other soil microbes consume organic 
matter (and one another) and excrete that matter in a form plants 
can use for growth. Earthworms, beetles, and other creatures also eat 
organic matter and tunnel through the soil, creating beneficial air spaces 
and excreting nutrients.
 
✓ Decreases harmful disease organisms: Beneficial microbes prey on and 
control harmful, plant-damaging nematodes and fungi.
 
✓ Improves the soil structure: Organic matter helps sandy soils stick 
together better and hold water and nutrients. It also helps open spaces 
between small, sticky clay particles so that clay soil drains better and 
contains more oxygen.
 
✓ Increases reserve of soil nutrients: Soil microbes store nutrients in 
their bodies; they release those nutrients as they die or are consumed 
by other microbes. The more microbes the soil contains, the more 
nutrients it can store.
Add organic matter to your plantings any time you can, whether you use 
straw mulch between vegetable garden beds, compost around perennial 
flowers, or bark mulch around trees or shrubs.
 
If you mix uncomposted, carbon-rich materials such as sawdust or straw into 
the soil, you’ll get a flurry of microbial activity. As the organisms reproduce in 
response to the influx of food, they tie up other nutrients, especially nitrogen. 
Plan to wait at least a month before planting; otherwise, your plants may show 
signs of nutrient deficiency. After the microbes do their work decomposing 
the carbon-rich material, they die; then the nitrogen and other nutrients tied 
up in their bodies return to the soil and become available to plants again. 
Carbon-rich materials applied on the surface of the soil as mulch decompose 
slowly and won’t tie up nutrients.
One of the end products of organic matter decomposition is humus, a 
chemically stable material that contributes to good soil fertility and structure. 
Humus is a sticky, shapeless substance in which no identifiable organic 
matter (leaves, stems, and so on) is present. The actual properties of humus 
are still a bit of a mystery to soil scientists, but they agree that it is an 

67
 Chapter 5: Building Healthy Soil
important part of a healthy soil ecosystem. Humus helps soil particles stick 
together to form aggregates and acts like a sponge to absorb and hold water 
and nutrients. People sometimes use the terms humus and organic matter 
interchangeably, or describe good soil as humus, but technically, humus is 
just one component of healthy, biologically active soil.
 
Sometimes, even the healthiest soil can’t provide all the nutrients garden 
plants need, and a boost of fertilizer is called for. For information on buying 
and using organic fertilizers, turn to Chapter 6.
Dung ho!
If you’re not yet a connoisseur of manure, think of it as processed organic 
matter that has already begun decomposing. It does wonders for soil health 
and plant growth. You can add the droppings of different farm (and some-
times wild) animals to your garden, giving the soil all the benefits of organic 
matter plus a boost of nutrients. Like a fine wine, however, manure is best 
when it’s aged before using.
 
Fresh manure contains concentrated nitrogen. It may be too potent for tender 
plants and can “burn” roots — similar to the way that a too-concentrated 
solution of synthetic fertilizer can burn roots. Let manure age for six months 
to a year before using it, or compost it for faster results (see “Compost: The 
prince of organic matter,” later in this chapter). Some garden resources refer 
to aged manure as well-rotted manure, which is the same thing.
Table 5-1 shows animal manures that you may find locally or bagged at 
your garden center, along with their relative nutrient values (dry weight) of 
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as some additional comments.
Table 5-1

If you live near a zoo, you may have access to the manures of wild animals, 
such as elephants and giraffes. You can also use water from your freshwater 
aquarium or pond.

68
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
 
Keep these rules in mind when using manures:
 
✓ Select manure from the oldest pile at the farm. Many farm manure piles 
contain lots of additional organic matter, such as sawdust from horse 
or chicken bedding. Manure mixed with bedding and aged for a year or 
more can be used directly on your garden.
 
✓ Use bagged manures. Bagged products usually are composted and 
ready to use. If you need lots of manure, however, buying bags can be 
costly.
 
✓ Avoid cat, dog, pig, and human manures. These substances can carry 
diseases that affect humans.
 
✓ Apply composted manure annually. In general, add a 2- to 3-inch layer 
of manure to garden beds and around perennial plants at least once a 
year. If you want to use fresh manure, add it to your garden in the fall 
(or whenever you can leave that part of the garden unplanted for six 
months or so), and mix it into the soil so it can slowly decompose.
 
A few people have become ill after handling fresh manure. Wear gloves and 
shoes when working with raw manure, and wash your hands and clothing 
afterward to be on the safe side. If the manure is dry and dusty, wear a dust 
mask. The National Organic Program rules state that raw animal manure must 
be composted or incorporated into the soil at least 120 days before the har-
vest of a crop whose edible portion has contact with the soil (such as root 
and leafy crops). Some experts recommend avoiding the use of uncomposted 
manure on edible crops.
Green manures and cover crops
Another great way to get organic matter into your garden is to grow your 
own. Green manures are plants that you grow specifically to cut down and 
mix into the soil to add organic matter and nutrients.
Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, green manure usu-
ally refers to crops that are planted during the regular growing season spe-
cifically to add organic matter and nutrients, and cover crop refers to plants 
grown during the dormant season — winter in most regions; summer in hot, 
dry climates — to help prevent erosion, loosen compacted soil, and control 
weeds, besides adding organic matter.

69
 Chapter 5: Building Healthy Soil
In addition to providing these benefits, green manures and cover crops do 
the following:
 
✓ Maintain high levels of soil microorganisms: When the plants are 
incorporated into the soil, they feed the essential microbes that make 
nutrients available to plants. The plant residues also provide surfaces 
on which the microbes can live.
 
✓ Attract beneficial insects: Some green manures and cover crops, such 
as clover and buckwheat, have flowers that beneficial insects love. 
These insects help with pollination and pest control in your garden.
The best type of plant for your green manure or cover crop depends on what 
you’re trying to accomplish, your climate, and the planting time. Plants that 
are often grown as green manures or cover crops include legumes, such as 
clover, vetch, cowpea, and fava bean; grasses, such as winter rye, wheat, oat, 
and barley; and buckwheat.
 
Farm supply stores usually offer a good selection, and the proprietors can 
suggest the best ones for gardens in your region. Mail-order catalogs offer the 
widest selection, but even small garden centers may sell the most common 
ones. Consult the package or catalog description for the amount of seed you 
need to sow per square foot.
Planting green manures
Using green manures is an ideal way to prepare the soil in new garden beds 
or beds that you intend to leave fallow (unplanted) for the growing season. 
Rototill the area, broadcast the seed, and let the green manure crop grow 
through the gardening season. At the end of the growing season, before the 
plants go to seed, mow the area and rototill to incorporate the material into 
the soil. Don’t let the plants produce mature seed if you want to prevent 
plants from returning next season. The garden will be ready for fall plant-
ing, or you can sow a fall cover crop. Buckwheat is a popular green manure 
because it grows quickly in summer.
Planting cover crops
Plant cover crops after the harvest when garden beds would otherwise be 
bare. Plant seeds a month or more before your dormant season. (Sow seeds 
in fall in the North, early summer in the Deep South and Southwest.) The 
seeds will sprout, begin to grow, and then slow down during the dormant 
season. When temperatures moderate, the plants grow again.

70
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
Winter rye, barley, and wheat are good choices for winter cover crops in 
areas where winter is the dormant season. In hot, dry climates in which 
summer is the dormant season, good choices are buckwheat and cowpeas. A 
few weeks before planting, mow the cover crop, till it into the soil, and allow 
the plant matter to begin decomposing.
Compost: The prince of organic matter
The best and most refined of organic matters is compost, which is organic 
matter and/or manures that have decomposed until they resemble loamy 
soil.
Whether you make your own compost (see the “Compost Happens: Making 
Your Own” section, later in this chapter) or buy it ready-made, you can add 
finished compost to the garden or around plants at any time. I pile a 2- to 
3-inch layer annually around my plants and on my garden beds.
Why not just add raw organic matter to your garden instead of compost-
ing it? When you compost the materials first, the final product is uniform in 
color, nutrients, and texture; is odor free; and contains fewer viable weed 
seeds and potential disease organisms (depending on how it was compos-
ted). Your plants will be happy with you for treating them so well.
As gardeners have become more aware of the value of compost, more 
sources of it have become available. You can buy compost in bulk (back the 
truck right up) or bagged, depending on where you live. The following sec-
tions explain these options. For many gardeners, making their own compost 
is the best solution. For information, head to the section “Compost Happens: 
Making Your Own.”
Buying bagged compost
Bagged compost is the easiest form to buy, especially if you have a small yard 
or container garden. Look for the words “certified organic,” the “OMRI Listed” 
seal, or some other indication that the contents are approved for organic 
growing and don’t come from contaminated sources, such as sewage sludge. 
(OMRI — the Organic Materials Review Institute, or OMRI — certifies products 
that meet the National Organic Standards. Find out more in Chapter 2.)
Buying compost in bulk
For larger quantities of compost, buy in bulk. The price is less in quantity, 
and you can check the quality of the compost as well. Many private companies, 
municipalities, and community groups make and sell compost. Often, they 
even deliver the compost to your yard for a fee.

71
 Chapter 5: Building Healthy Soil
 
Use these tips to evaluate bulk compost:
 
✓ Consider the source. Before buying the compost, ask about the primary, 
organic-matter sources that were used to make the compost. Compost 
made from yard waste (leaves and grass clippings) is considered to be 
the safest and best. Other compost may contain ingredients that had 
contaminants, such as herbicides from agricultural crop residues and 
heavy metals from municipal wastes, which may affect the growth of 
your plants or accumulate toxins in your soil. Ask if the finished product 
is tested for contaminants.
 
✓ Look at the color and texture. Finished compost should look dark and 
have a crumbly texture without any large pieces of undecomposed 
organic matter, such as branches or pieces of wood.
 
✓ Squeeze it. If water oozes out when you squeeze a handful of the 
material, it’s too wet; if it blows away easily, it’s too dry.
 
✓ Give it a whiff. The smell should be earthy, without a strong ammonia 
or sour smell.
Compost Happens: Making Your Own
Making your own compost is probably the simplest way to ensure high-quality 
compost and save some money. The process really isn’t as complicated as 
you may think; the many commercial composting bins and containers on the 
market make composting a mess-free, hassle-free process.
When you make compost, you create a pile of material to be composted, mix 
the materials thoroughly at the correct ratios of carbon (brown stuff) and 
nitrogen (green stuff) — explained in detail in “Maintaining proper ratios,” 
later in this chapter — and keep the pile watered just enough to keep it moist 
but with enough air to breathe. Using this method, you can enjoy finished 
compost a month or two after you start.
 
Why not just pile the material in the backyard somewhere and let it rot on its 
own? A pile just thrown together and not maintained may dry out too much 
for microbes to flourish, or it may stay so wet that the wrong microbes take 
over. Anaerobic bacterial thrive in saturated conditions, and their presence 
results in a slimy, sour-smelling pile. Anaerobes don’t produce as much heat 
as aerobic bacteria (see the following section), so they won’t kill the weeds 
and pests, and the pile will take much longer to decompose.

72
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
Getting your compost pile started
A well-constructed and well-maintained pile provides the proper amount 
of water and oxygen for aerobic bacteria, which are the best decomposing 
microbes; they work quickly, generating heat as a byproduct of their activity. 
This heat helps material break down quickly and kills many diseases, insects, 
and weed seeds. Containing your compost pile makes it look neater, helps 
you maintain the correct moisture, and prevents animals from getting into it.
Here’s what you need to know to build a good compost pile:
 
1. Choose a shady location that’s out of the way but still within view so 
that you don’t forget about the pile.
 
 The soil under the site should be well drained.
 
2. Make (or buy) a bin.
 
 You can build your own (see Figure 5-2) or buy a commercial home 
composting unit, like those shown in Figure 5-3.
 
3. Add dry materials.
 
 Add a 6-inch layer of dry (brown) organic matter — such as hay, straw, 
old leaves, or sawdust — to the bottom of the container.
 
4. Add fresh materials.
 
 Add a 2- to 3-inch layer of fresh (green) organic matter — such as grass 
clippings, manure, table scraps, or even high-nitrogen fertilizer such as 
cottonseed meal — on top of the dry layer. For advice on choosing your 
ingredients, go to “Choosing materials to compost,” later in this chapter.
 
5. Keep adding these layers, watering each one as you go, until the pile 
is 4 to 5 feet tall and fills the bin.
 
 A smaller pile won’t heat up well enough to break down the materials, 
and a larger pile can be difficult to manage.
 
6. In two days, mix the layers thoroughly.
 
 Particle size should be varied; smaller particles hasten decomposition.
 
7. Cover the pile with a tarp to keep rain away and preserve moisture.
 
 If the pile gets too soggy or too dry, it won’t heat up.

Keepin’ it cookin’
The pile will start to cook within a week. Now you need to keep it cooking. 
After all, a hot pile is a happy pile. Here’s the procedure:
 
1. Keep the pile moist by watering it periodically.
 
 Dig into the pile about 1 foot to see whether it’s moist. If not, water the 
pile thoroughly, but not so much that it’s soggy.

74
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
 
2. Turn the pile when it cools down.
 
 Using a garden fork, remove the outside layers and put them aside. 
Remove the inside layers into another pile and then switch. Place the 
outside layers in the center of the new pile and the inside layers along 
the outside of the new pile. Loosen any matted clumps.
 
3. Let it cook again.
 
 How hot it gets and how long it cooks depend on the C/N ratio, or 
carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, of materials in the pile and whether you have the 
correct moisture levels. For information on C/N ratios, see “Maintaining 
proper ratios,” later in this chapter.
 
4. When the pile is cool, turn it again.
 
 You should have finished compost after two to three turnings. The 
finished product should be cool and crumbly, with a dark color and 
earthy smell.
Sometimes, a compost pile never heats up, smells bad, or contains pieces of 
undercomposed materials. Chances are that one of the following conditions 
occurred:
 
✓ The pile was too wet or dry.
 
✓ You added too many carbon materials and not enough nitrogen materials.
 
✓ The pieces of material were too big or packed together. Shred leaves, 
branches, and pieces of wood to help them decompose more quickly.
 
✓ The pile was too small.
You can find lots of compost aids on the market. Bioactivators — packages 
of concentrated microbes — are among the most popular because they can 
speed the decomposition process. These microbes occur naturally, however, 
and many are already present in a well-constructed compost pile.
Choosing materials to compost
What you put in the compost pile is up to you; just remember that it needs to 
be from an organic material. Here’s a short list of possibilities:
 
✓ Hay, straw, pine needles, leaves, yard trimmings, and weeds
 
✓ Kitchen scraps (eggshells, old bread, and vegetable and fruit scraps)
 
✓ Manure (except dog, cat, pig, or human) 
 
✓ Sawdust and wood chips
 
✓ Shredded newspaper

75
 Chapter 5: Building Healthy Soil
 
Avoid adding the following to your compost bin:
 
✓ Kitchen scraps containing meat, oil, fish, dairy products, and bones 
(They attract unwanted animals, such as rats and raccoons.)
 
✓ Weeds that have gone to seed or that spread by their roots, such as 
quack grass
 
✓ Diseased or insect-infested vegetable or flower plants
 
✓ Herbicide-treated grass clippings or weeds
 
✓ Dog, cat, pig, or human feces
Maintaining proper ratios
In composting corners, you often hear about the C/N ratio or carbon-to-nitrogen 
ratio. All organic matter can be divided into carbon-rich (brown stuff) and 
nitrogen-rich (green stuff) materials. Using the right mixture of brown to green 
stuff when building a compost pile encourages the pile to heat up and decom-
pose efficiently.
Table 5-2 shows which common compost materials are high in carbon and 
which materials are high in nitrogen. Notice that the soft, fresh materials, 
such as fresh grass clippings, tend to be higher in nitrogen than hard, dry 
materials, such as sawdust. Mix these materials to form a pile with an aver-
age C/N ratio of 25:1 to 30:1, and you’ll be well on your way to beautiful 
compost. Note: Use the ratios in Table 5-2 as guidelines. Actual ratios vary 
depending on the sources of the materials and other factors.
 
Speaking of sources, make sure that your compost materials haven’t been 
contaminated with pesticides or other chemicals.

Turning Your Soil 
Whether to use a rotary tiller is an ongoing philosophical debate among 
gardeners, with promoters and detractors arguing the issue. Rotary tillers, 
often called tillers for short, are machines with blades or tines that chop into 
the soil, churning (or tilling) it and blending everything in the top 6 to 12 
inches of soil. Following are some of the factors to consider and arguments 
on both sides of the fence:
 
✓ Tilling is an easy way to incorporate soil amendments, such as lime, 
compost, and green manure crops into the soil.
 
✓ Tilling turns weeds under, facilitating their decomposition. But it can also 
bring weed seeds to the surface of the soil, where they can germinate 
readily. It can also chop and disperse roots of perennial weeds, facilitating 
their spread.
 
✓ Tilling can kill some insects and diseases that may be lurking around 
the soil surface. But it can also kill earthworms and other beneficial soil 
creatures.
 
✓ Tilling makes for a clean garden bed that’s easy to plant. But it can also 
damage soil structure, increasing the risk of creating a poorly drained 
and hard-to-work soil, especially if the area is tilled when the soil is still 
too wet.
 
✓ Tilling hastens the breakdown of desirable organic matter, so you have 
to add organic material more frequently and in greater quantities.
 
✓ Tilling promotes erosion, especially when you’re gardening on a slope or 
in a windy area.
 
✓ Repeated tilling can create a compacted layer just below the tilled layer.
Quick and easy compost recipes
To make the most compost in the shortest time, 
try some of these proven recipes. For each 
recipe, mix the ingredients thoroughly, and 
follow the directions in “Keepin’ it cookin’,” ear-
lier in this chapter. Depending on the weather 
and compost ingredients, you should have fin-
ished compost within one to two months.
 ✓ Recipe 1: Use 4 parts kitchen scraps from 
fruits and vegetables, 2 parts chicken or 
cow manure, 1 part shredded newspaper 
(black ink only), and 1 part shredded dry 
leaves.
 ✓ Recipe 2: Use 2 parts kitchen scraps, 1 
part chicken manure, and 1 part shredded 
leaves.
 ✓ Recipe 3: Use 2 parts grass clippings, 1 
part chicken manure, and 1 part shredded 
leaves.

77
 Chapter 5: Building Healthy Soil
 
An alternative to tilling that’s easier on the soil and gives you more exercise 
is using a turning tool such as a garden fork, shovel, or U-bar (shown in 
Figure 5-4). These tools work especially well in small, raised beds that don’t 
have a lot of earth to turn. A few weeks before planting, add any compost or 
amendments, and use these tools to turn the soil over. Then rake the bed 
smooth, and plant to your heart’s content.
If you have a large garden or are breaking new ground, a powerful tiller can 
save time and effort. To minimize damage, till as little as possible, using hand 
tools to do the rest of the work.
 
Figure 5-4: 
A U-bar tool.
 
No-till gardening
Because tilling can be so disruptive to the soil ecosystem, some gardeners 
use a no-till system. If you’re patient, you can create a garden without 
disturbing the soil at all by using sheet composting. Follow these steps:
 
1. Cut existing vegetation close to the soil line.

78
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
 
2. Cover the area with layers of newspaper or cardboard, and begin 
adding layers of organic matter, using the same ratios suggested for 
compost piles.
 
3. Continue adding layers to a depth of a foot or so.
 
4. Cover the entire area with a few inches of straw.
 
5. Wait.
 
 In six months to a year, depending on the climate and time of year, you 
should be able to dig through the pile into the native soil and begin 
planting.
Maintain your no-till garden by keeping unplanted areas covered with a thick 
layer of organic mulch.
Raised beds
A raised bed is soil that has been mounded to form a large flat surface. 
Raised beds are commonly used in vegetable gardens, but the principles 
apply to other types of plantings too. These structures offer many advantages, 
especially if you have poorly drained or clayey soil:
 
✓ Faster soil drainage: Water drains quickly from the loose, mounded soil.
 
✓ Faster soil warmup in the spring: Drier soil warms more rapidly than 
water-saturated soil.
 
✓ Prevention of soil compaction: Because you don’t step on raised beds, 
the soil doesn’t compact as much, and the roots grow better.
 
✓ Concentration and conservation of fertilizer and water in the growing 
zone: Materials are applied only to the beds, rather than broadcast over 
the entire garden, including paths.
 
✓ Efficient and more productive plants: More ideal growing conditions 
allow you to space plants a little closer together than normal, thereby 
reducing watering and weeding.
You can build two types of raised beds: contained and freestanding. 
Contained raised beds have permanent walls around them made of wood, 
bricks, or stone. These beds look neat and tidy and are good for permanent 
plantings. Freestanding raised beds don’t have walls made from other materi-
als, so you can modify their shape and size.

79
 Chapter 5: Building Healthy Soil
Limit the width of raised beds to 3 to 4 feet so that you can reach in to tend 
plants without stepping on the soil. The height of raised beds is up to you; a 
height of 6 to 12 inches provides all the benefits listed in this section.
You can make a raised bed by raking existing soil into a mound or by bringing 
in extra topsoil. When you have the bed, amend the soil with compost each 
year to replace nutrients removed by harvesting. Work the compost into the 
top 12 inches of soil with a garden fork, and smooth the top of the bed with a 
garden rake, as shown in Figure 5-5.

▶ Choosing the right kind of fertilizer
▶ Securing sources of organic fertilizer
P
lants need nutrients to grow; flourish; and fend off pests, diseases, and 
environmental stresses. Giving them the nutrients they need is key to 
successful organic gardening. Healthy soil that contains plenty of compost or 
organic matter goes a long way toward providing essential nutrients for plant 
growth, but your plants may still need additional nutrients to grow to their 
full potential. In this chapter, I give you the lowdown on organic fertilizers — 
those derived from natural plant, animal, and mineral sources — and how to 
use them.
Fertilizers 101
In contrast to soil amendments that improve the overall soil environment, 
fertilizers are formulated to provide specific plant nutrients in specific 
amounts.
It’s a myth that all plants need repeated fertilizing throughout the growing 
season. Plants growing in healthy soil — soil that has the proper pH and 
is amended regularly with organic matter — may thrive just fine without 
supplemental feeding. Trees, shrubs, and perennials especially adapt well to 
slow, steady growth. The fast growth stimulated by heavy fertilizing, on the 
other hand, can result in weak, succulent plant tissue that’s more susceptible 
to attack by insects and diseases and to damage from severe weather.

82
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
Vegetables often benefit most from fertilizing. We expect these plants — 
whether they’re broccoli or corn or zucchini — to put on fast growth and 
produce abundantly, and when we harvest, we remove nutrient-rich plant 
material, so we need to replace those nutrients in the soil. Annual flowers 
also thrive with supplemental feeding, especially those growing in containers.
The continuous flowering we expect from our petunias and impatiens 
requires a reliable supply of nutrients.
 
Garden centers, farm stores, and catalog suppliers offer fertilizers in so many 
forms that you may get confused about which ones to choose. Make your 
decision based on the cost of the actual nutrients, the ease of application, and 
how quickly you want the nutrients to become available to the plants.
Organic versus synthetic fertilizers
Organic fertilizers generally come from plants, animals, or minerals. Most 
organic fertilizers contain a broad range of nutrients, including important 
trace elements; many add organic matter to the soil and enhance the soil 
ecosystem. By contrast, synthetic fertilizers have specific chemical formula-
tions and often contain only three nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorous, and 
potassium. These products don’t do anything to enhance soil life, and they 
don’t add organic matter.
Organic fertilizers have other benefits over synthetic fertilizers for both soil 
and plants:
 
✓ They release their nutrients more slowly in the soil, when the plants 
need them, so they last longer.
 
✓ The nutrients are contained in complex molecules that won’t leach away 
with the first rain.
 
✓ They are less likely to burn the young roots of seedlings. Synthetic 
fertilizers are made from mineral salts that can kill roots as well as soil 
microbes if applied improperly.
 
✓ They enhance soil health by nurturing (or at least not harming) the soil 
microbes that help make soil nutrients available to plants.
In general, organic fertilizers are a kinder, gentler way to give plants the 
nutrients they need.

83
 Chapter 6: Using Organic Fertilizers
Fast release versus slow release
Applying nutrients in a form that plants can use immediately may seem logical, 
but often, that strategy isn’t the best one. The nutrients in fast-release, or 
highly soluble, fertilizers are ready to use as soon as you apply them. The 
problem is that plants may not be able to use all the nutrients right away, so 
any excess nutrients can leach away or run off, possibly leading to stream or 
groundwater pollution. Later, when the plant is ready to use the nutrients, 
they’re gone.
Most organic fertilizers provide a slow, steady supply of nutrients. Often, 
the nutrients are bound in organic molecules that require the ongoing action 
of soil microbes to release them. This process gives plants a limited but 
steady supply of nutrients, mimicking nature’s processes. (Many fertilizer 
manufacturers are now creating slow-release formulas of synthetic fertilizers. 
Sometimes, these fertilizers are bound into little pellets that dissolve slowly 
in the soil. Although they’re a step up from fast-release synthetic fertilizers, 
these fertilizers don’t offer all the benefits of organic alternatives. They still 
may contain only nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, for example, and 
they do nothing to improve the soil environment.)
Some organic fertilizers are relatively fast-release. Liquid seaweed/fish 
emulsion blends, for example, contain a supply of readily available nutrients. 
They’re perfect when plants need an extra boost, and they contain a broad 
range of trace elements too. Slow-release organic fertilizers such as rock 
powders, on the other hand, break down slowly in the soil environment, 
releasing their nutrients over months or years.
 
Before adding fertilizer, take a soil sample to a soil-testing lab or use a home test 
kit to find out the soil pH and to see exactly which minerals your plants need and 
in what quantities. Even if your plants show signs of a nutrient deficiency, your 
soil may need a pH adjustment instead of fertilizer (as discussed in Chapter 5). 
Also note that some plants have special pH and nutrient requirements. Check 
the plant descriptions in Part IV to find out more.
The big three
Nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium are the three nutrients plants need in 
the largest quantities; they’re sometimes referred to as the primary nutrients. 
They each play a critical role in plant growth and development. Healthy, fer-
tile soil naturally contains these three elements, and plants can easily take 
them up. But if your soil is deficient or if you’re growing vegetables, fruits, 
or other demanding crops, you may want to supplement the soil’s nutrients 
with fertilizers.

84
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
 
Complete fertilizers contain nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K), 
but don’t let the term complete fool you. It doesn’t mean that the fertilizer has 
all the nutrients that plants need — just that it contains three of the major 
ones. (In case you’re wondering, the scientific symbol for potassium, K, comes 
from the Latin word kalium.) Bags of complete fertilizers are labeled with 
three numbers, such as 5-3-3. Each number represents the percentage of N, P, 
and K in that bag, in that order, as measured by weight. A bag of 5-3-3 fertil-
izer, then, contains 5 percent nitrogen, 3 percent phosphorous, and 3 percent 
potassium.
 
You need to know the actual percentages of nutrients in the bag because a soil 
test often recommends pounds of actual N, P, or K to add to your garden. To 
determine the amount of each nutrient in the bag, multiply the weight of the 
bag (say, 20 pounds) by the percentage of each nutrient — for example, 20 
pounds × 5% (.05) = 1 pound of nitrogen. If the soil test recommends 2 pounds 
of actual nitrogen per 100 square feet, you want to evenly distribute two 
20-pound bags of this 5-3-3 fertilizer over each 10-x-10-foot section of garden.
Nitrogen (N)
Nitrogen is responsible for the healthy green foliage of plants, as well as 
protein and chlorophyll development. (Chlorophyll is the pigment that makes 
plants green and is a vital component of photosynthesis.) Nitrogen moves 
easily in the soil and leaches out rapidly, especially from sandy soils and in 
high-rainfall areas or irrigated gardens.
Plants use lots of nitrogen during the growing season, so nitrogen is commonly 
the most deficient element. If you add too much nitrogen, however, plants 
have dark green, leafy growth but less root development and delayed flower-
ing or fruiting. Also, pests may target the overly vigorous growth stimulated 
by excess nitrogen. Symptoms of nitrogen deficiency include slow growth 
and yellowing leaves, especially in older foliage.
Phosphorous (P)
Plants need phosphorus for strong root growth; fruit, stem, and seed 
development; disease resistance; and general plant vigor. Phosphorous 
doesn’t move in the soil as easily as nitrogen does, so you don’t have to add 
it as frequently.
Depending on where you live, your soil may have plenty of phosphorous, but 
that nutrient may be unavailable to plants. Phosphorus availability depends 
on soil temperatures, pH range, and the soil levels of other nutrients (such 
as calcium and potassium). Maintain the soil pH between 5 and 7 to keep 
phosphorous available. Work phosphorous-rich fertilizers into the soil 
around the root zone at planting time to make the nutrient readily accessible 
to plant roots. Deficiency symptoms include stunted plants with dark green 
foliage, reddish-purple stems or leaves, and fruits that drop early.

85
 Chapter 6: Using Organic Fertilizers
Potassium (K)
Potassium, sometimes called potash, is essential for vigorous growth, disease 
resistance, fruit and vegetable flavor and development, and general plant 
function.
Potassium doesn’t move around in the soil, so work the fertilizer into the 
root zone. Potassium also breaks down slowly, so you won’t need to add it 
often. Annual applications of organic matter may supply enough potassium, 
but a soil test is the surest way to determine need. Avoid adding too much 
potassium fertilizer because it can make other nutrients (such as magne-
sium) unavailable.
Deficiency symptoms include yellow areas along the leaf veins and leaf edges, 
crinkled and rolled-up leaves, and dead twigs. Fruit trees growing in potassium-
deficient soils may have poorly developed or bland-tasting fruit. In conifers, 
the needles on the tree become dark blue-green and then turn yellow to 
reddish brown. (Note that some conifers, mainly pines, normally shed older, 
yellow needles.) Florida palms are especially prone to deficiency of this 
nutrient: Their leaves develop yellow to orange spots on the oldest foliage 
first, and then the leaf edges turn brown and die.
Secondary nutrients
Calcium, magnesium, and sulfur are called secondary elements. They’re 
essential not only for plant growth, but also for adjusting and maintaining soil 
pH — the measure of acidity and alkalinity of the soil (see Chapter 5). These 
nutrients are also vital to plant functioning, and excessive or deficient levels 
can upset plants’ ability to use other nutrients in the soil.
Although it’s rare for home garden soils to be deficient in these nutrients, 
keep your eye out for these deficiency symptoms:
 
✓ Calcium: Calcium-deficient plants may have twisted, dark green new 
leaves and leaf-tip burn. Flowers may have weak stems, and fruit may 
develop rotten spots on the bottom (opposite the stem end).
 
✓ Magnesium: Magnesium-deficient plants have curled leaf edges and 
discolored older leaves.
 
✓ Sulfur: Sulfur deficiency results in slow growth and small, spindly 
plants.
Limestone, which contains calcium, and dolomitic limestone, which contains 
calcium and magnesium, are used to raise the pH of acid soils toward neutral, 
where most plants grow best. In alkaline soils, sulfur helps lower the pH to 
the optimum level. 

86
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
Micronutrients
The essential nutrients that plants need in the smallest quantities are 
called micronutrients, and they include iron, manganese, boron, copper, 
zinc, molybdenum, chlorine, and nickel. Fortunately, organic matter usually 
supplies adequate amounts of these nutrients, because adding too much of 
any one of these micronutrients can cause more problems than adding none 
at all.
Micronutrient deficiency is often hard to spot because plants vary in their 
specific needs and symptoms. Too little iron, for example, can cause blue-
berry leaves to turn yellow between the veins; too little boron can cause 
black spots on beet roots.
If your plants have a micronutrient deficiency, the best solution may be to 
adjust the pH to the level that those specific plants prefer rather than to 
apply micronutrient fertilizers. Blueberries, for example, require acidic soil; 
at a pH of 4.2 to 5, the plants usually can take up all the iron they need from 
the soil. If blueberry plants show symptoms of iron deficiency, check the 
soil pH, and adjust it if necessary. Beets, on the other hand, prefer a soil pH 
between 6.5 and 7. If the pH is too low or too high, they can’t take up the 
boron they need. It’s better to adjust the pH than to add boron-rich fertilizers, 
because too much boron can harm other types of plants.
 
It pays to research the plants you’re growing so that you can provide them the 
basic growing environment they require. You’ll save time, aggravation, and 
money spent on unnecessary — and possibly detrimental — micronutrient 
fertilizers.
Some fertilizers contain chelated micronutrients. In the process of chelation, 
the nutrients are chemically bound to other molecules so that the plants can 
absorb them more easily. Usually, chelated micronutrient fertilizers are used 
to provide a quick, short-term fix for mineral deficiencies.
Application methods
Application methods simply come down to spraying, spreading, or sprinkling. 
Here’s how to apply some common types of fertilizer:
 
✓ Granular: Among the most common and easily applied forms, granular 
fertilizers are also among the most economical. Sprinkle by hand or 
broadcast them with a lawn spreader around plants or over the lawn. 
Many organic fertilizers come in granular form.

87
 Chapter 6: Using Organic Fertilizers
 
✓ Powder: Some fertilizers, such as limestone and rock powders, are so 
finely ground that they readily blow in the wind. When applying them 
in your garden, choose a windless day, and wear a dust mask. As an 
alternative, look for pelletized forms of these fertilizers. 
 
 Granular and powder fertilizers take time to break down and release 
their contents to the soil and plants, so apply them a few weeks before 
planting vegetables and flowers, and use them as long-term sources of 
nutrients for trees, shrubs, lawns, and perennials. Generally, the smaller 
the particles, the more quickly the fertilizer becomes available to plant 
roots.
 
✓ Liquid: Liquid fertilizers give plants a quick nutrient boost. Common 
liquid fertilizers include fish emulsion and seaweed extract, as well as 
homemade “tea.” (You can find a recipe for manure and compost teas 
in the sidebar “Tea,anyone?” later in this chapter.) Liquid fertilizers are 
good candidates for foliar feeding, that is, being applied directly to plant 
leaves.
 
To apply nutrients during the growing season, side-dress plants by applying 
granular or liquid fertilizer to the soil about 6 inches from plant stems. For 
even faster results, apply liquid fertilizers directly to plant leaves (called foliar 
feeding). Mix foliar fertilizers with water with neutral pH (7.0), and apply only 
when air temperatures are below 85 degrees Fahrenheit. One or two side 
dressings or foliar feedings during the active growing season should be plenty 
for most garden vegetables and flowers. Container-grown plants may need 
monthly fertilizing for best growth.
Types of Organic Fertilizers
Commercially formulated fertilizers list specific nutrient levels on the pack-
age, but bulk products, such as compost and manure, have widely variable 
contents. The nutrient levels I mention for each fertilizer type in this section 
are approximate, because levels vary somewhat depending on the product 
and supplier.
Plant-based fertilizers
Fertilizers made from plants generally have low to moderate N-P-K values, but 
their nutrients quickly become available in the soil for your plants to use. Some 
of them even provide an extra dose of trace minerals and micronutrients. The 
most commonly available plant-based fertilizers include the following:

88
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
 
✓ Alfalfa meal: Derived from alfalfa plants and pressed into pellet form, 
alfalfa meal is beneficial for adding nitrogen and potassium (about 2 
percent each), as well as trace minerals and natural growth stimulants. 
Roses in particular seem to like this fertilizer; they benefit from up to 5 
cups of alfalfa meal per plant every ten weeks, worked into the surface of 
the soil. Add some to your compost pile, too, to speed the decomposition 
process.
 
✓ Compost: As I discuss in Chapter 5, compost is beneficial mostly for 
adding organic matter to the soil. Although it supplies some nutrients, 
its most important roles are enhancing soil life and helping make nutrients 
available to plants.
 
✓ Corn gluten meal: Derived from corn, this powder contains 10 percent 
nitrogen fertilizer. Apply it only to actively growing plants, because it 
inhibits the growth of seeds. The manufacturer recommends allowing 
one to four months after using this product before planting seeds, 
depending on the soil and weather conditions. Use it on lawns in early 
spring to green up the perennial grasses and prevent annual weeds like 
crabgrass from sprouting.
 
✓ Cottonseed meal: Derived from the seed in cotton bolls, this granular 
fertilizer is particularly good at supplying nitrogen (6 percent) and 
potassium (1.5 percent). Look for organic cottonseed meal; traditional 
cotton crops are sprayed heavily with pesticides, some of which can 
remain in the seed oils.
 
✓ Kelp/seaweed: Derived from sea plants, this product comes in liquid, 
powder, and pellet forms. Although kelp/seaweed fertilizer contains only 
small amounts of N, P, and K, kelp adds valuable micronutrients, growth 
hormones, and vitamins that help increase yields, reduce plant stress 
from drought, and increase frost tolerance. Apply it to the soil or as a 
foliar spray.
 
✓ Soybean meal: Derived from soybeans and used in pellet form, soybean 
meal is prized for its high nitrogen (7 percent) content and is used as a 
source of phosphorous (2 percent). Like alfalfa meal, it is particularly 
beneficial to nitrogen-loving plants, such as roses.
 
✓ Humus: When looking at organic fertilizer products, you’ll invariably 
come across those containing humus, humic acid, or humates. Humus is 
a stable end product of organic-matter decomposition that’s believed to 
increase microbial activity in soil, improve soil structure, and enhance 
the root development of plants. Although it doesn’t necessarily add 
nutrients directly, humus may help plants take up the fertilizers you 
apply. If you add compost to your garden regularly, you’re already 
adding humus, so it’s probably not worth purchasing it. If you’re not 
using compost, it may be a useful amendment.
Other plant-based organic fertilizers include cocoa meal (may be toxic to 
pets), coffee grounds, molasses, and peanut meal.

89
 Chapter 6: Using Organic Fertilizers
Animal-based fertilizers
Whether by land, by sea, or by air, animals, fish, and birds all provide organic 
fertilizers that can help plants grow. Following are some of the most commonly 
available kinds:
 
✓ Manures: Animal manures provide lots of organic matter to the soil, but 
most have low nutrient value. A few, such as chicken manure, do have 
high available nitrogen content. In general, use only composted manures, 
because fresh manures can burn tender roots. You can find much more 
information on manures and the many available types in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Bat/seabird guano: Yes, this product is what it sounds like — the poop 
of bats and seabirds. Guano comes in powdered or pellet form and is 
high in nitrogen (10 to 12 percent). Bat guano provides only about 2 
percent phosphorous and no potassium, but seabird guano contains 10 
to 12 percent P, plus 2 percent K. The concentrated nitrogen in these 
products can burn roots if they’re not used carefully. Use them to make 
manure tea, as described in the sidebar “Tea, anyone?” They tend to be 
more expensive than land-animal manures.
 
✓ Blood meal: It’s a bit gruesome, but blood meal is the powdered blood 
of slaughtered animals. It contains about 14 percent nitrogen and many 
micronutrients. Leafy, nitrogen-loving plants such as lettuce grow well 
with this fertilizer. Reportedly, blood meal also repels deer (but may 
attract dogs and cats).
 
✓ Bonemeal: A popular source of phosphorous (11 percent) and calcium (22 
percent), bonemeal is derived from animal or fish bones and is commonly 
used in powdered form on root crops and bulbs. It also contains 2 percent 
nitrogen and many micronutrients. It may attract rodents.
 
✓ Fish products: Fish byproducts make excellent fertilizers, and you can 
buy them in several forms:
 
• Fish emulsion is derived from the fermented remains of fish. This 
liquid product can have a fishy smell (even the deodorized version), 
but it’s a great complete fertilizer (5-2-2) and adds trace elements 
to the soil. When mixed with water, it’s gentle yet effective for 
stimulating the growth of young seedlings.
 
• Hydrolyzed fish powder has higher nitrogen content (12 percent) 
than fish emulsion; it’s mixed with water and sprayed on plants.
 
• Fish meal, which is high in nitrogen and phosphorus, is applied to 
the soil.
 
 Some products blend fish with seaweed or kelp (refer to “Plant-based 
fertilizers,” earlier in this chapter) for added nutrition and growth 
stimulation.
Other animal-based organic fertilizers include crab meal, dried whey, earth-
worm castings, feather meal, and leather meal.

90
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
 
Using composted human waste (euphemistically called night soil) to fertilize 
gardens has been a common practice in countries such as China for genera-
tions. In many Western countries, our version of this practice is using compos-
ted sewage sludge as fertilizer. Modern sewage treatment plants, however, 
receive waste from many sources, including industries. Although sludge has 
fertilizer and soil-building value, sewage sludge is not generally considered to 
be an organic fertilizer, because it may contain toxic heavy metals that accu-
mulate in the soil. Although you can buy granular fertilizers made from sludge, 
organic gardeners generally avoid them.
Rock on with mineral-based fertilizers
Most rock fertilizers decompose slowly into soil, releasing minerals gradu-
ally over a period of years. Organic gardeners use many different minerals to 
increase the fertility of their soils, but fertilizing with minerals is a long-term 
proposition. Because some of these products take months or years to break 
down fully into forms that plants can use, one application may last a long 
time. Following is a list of rock powders, the nutrients they supply, and appli-
cation tips:
 
✓ Chilean nitrate of soda: Mined in the deserts of Chile, this highly 
soluble, fast-acting granular fertilizer contains 16 percent nitrogen. It’s 
also high in sodium, though, so don’t use it on arid soils (in which salt 
buildup is likely) or on salt-sensitive plants. Because it is so fast-acting, 
this product can harm soil life; certified organic farms may use it to 
supply only 20 percent of a crop’s nitrogen.
Tea, anyone?
You can use animal manures and compost to 
make liquid fertilizers called manure tea and 
compost tea. The brewing process yields nutri-
ents that are readily available for plant use, and 
the teas are gentle enough to use on young plants 
and to spray on plant foliage for a quick boost. 
Here’s how to make manure or compost tea:
 1. Place a shovelful of aged manure and/or 
compost in a burlap bag (or other porous 
cloth bag), and secure the top.
 2. Submerge the bag in 10 to 15 gallons of 
water, and let it steep for one week or 
until the liquid takes on the color of strong 
brewed tea.
 3. Pour off the liquid, and dilute it until it’s the 
color of weak brewed tea.
 4. Use the diluted tea to water around plants.
 5. Dilute it again to half strength for use on 
young seedlings and as a foliar spray.

91
 Chapter 6: Using Organic Fertilizers
 
✓ Epsom salt: Epsom salt helps tired feet — and it’s a fertilizer too! 
Containing magnesium (10 percent) and sulfur (13 percent), Epsom salt 
is a fast-acting fertilizer that you can apply in granular form or dissolve 
in water and spray on leaves as a foliar fertilizer. Tomatoes, peppers, 
and roses love this stuff! Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom salt in a gallon of 
water, and spray it on plants when they start to bloom.
 
✓ Greensand: Mined in New Jersey from 70-million-year-old marine 
deposits, greensand contains 3 percent potassium and many 
micronutrients. It’s sold in powdered form. Greensand breaks down 
slowly, so it’s used to build long-term reserves of soil potassium.
 
✓ Gypsum: This powdered mineral contains calcium (20 percent) and 
sulfur (15 percent). It adds calcium to soil without raising the soil pH. 
Some gardeners claim that it helps loosen heavy clay soils.
 
✓ Hard-rock phosphate: This mineral powder contains 20 percent 
phosphorous and 48 percent calcium, which can raise soil pH; avoid it if 
your soil is already alkaline. It breaks down slowly, so use it to build the 
long-term supply of phosphorous in your soil.
 
✓ Soft-rock phosphate: Often called colloidal phosphate, soft-rock phosphate 
contains less phosphorus (16 percent) and calcium (19 percent) than hard-
rock phosphate, but the nutrients are in chemical forms that plants can use 
more easily. This powder breaks down slowly, so one application may last 
for years in the soil. It also contains many micronutrients.
 
✓ Limestone: This mined product has various nutrient levels, depending 
on its source. It’s used primarily to raise pH. Calcitic limestone is high 
in calcium carbonate (usually above 90 percent). Dolomitic limestone 
contains both calcium (46 percent) and magnesium (38 percent). These 
powders are often available in easier-to-spread granular forms. Conduct 
a soil test (see Chapter 5) for pH and for magnesium to find out which 
kind of lime, and how much, to add to your soil.
 
✓ Rock dusts: These powders, which are mined from various rocks, often 
contain few major nutrients but are loaded with micronutrients and other 
essential elements that plants need in small quantities. One dust, called 
Azomite, supplies more than 50 trace minerals; another, granite dust, 
breaks down very slowly and contains about 3 to 5 percent potassium 
plus trace elements. Use these products as supplements in regular soil-
building and fertility programs.
 
✓ Sul-Po-Mag: Also known as K-Mag, this mineral source provides plants 
readily accessible potassium (22 percent), magnesium (11 percent), and 
sulfur (22 percent). Use it to add magnesium to high-pH soils without 
raising the pH.
 
✓ Sulfur: This yellow powder contains 90 percent elemental sulfur, which 
is used not only as a nutrient for plant growth, but also to lower the pH. 
Go easy on the application, however, because overuse can decrease soil-
microbe activity.

92
Part II: Soil and Fertilizers 
Finding a Sustainable Source
Organic gardeners striving to build a sustainable landscape must take into 
account the sources of the materials they use. Many organic fertilizers and 
soil amendments are bulky and heavy, and some are shipped hundreds or 
thousands of miles to reach garden centers. Consider the amount of nonre-
newable petroleum needed to transport these products.
 
Start your search for fertilizers in your own backyard and neighborhood. You 
may be able to satisfy all your plants’ nutrient needs by using green manures 
and homemade compost, and by finding sources of fertilizer close to home: 
coffee grounds from local coffee shops, for example, and waste from various 
manufacturing processes such as breweries and dairy processors. If you live 
near an ocean, seaweed (rinsed of salt) may be an option.
 
You can find most of the fertilizers discussed in this chapter in local garden 
centers and home-and-garden supply stores. If you can’t find what you want,

Part III
Managing Pests

In this part . . .
Just as you expect ants at a picnic, you can count on 
weeds in a garden and bugs on the plants. But these 
pests don’t have to spoil your fun or your gardening 
success. Instead of reaching for a pest-killing potion, turn 
to this part for environmentally safe and effective 
solutions.
For an overview of organic pest control, look to Chapter 7. 
You’ll learn how to prevent many pest problems and 
diagnose those that do arise. When you know what’s 
“bugging” your garden, read on to learn about the many 
organic pest control products.
Chapter 8 is all about insects — good and bad. If you can 
identify and nurture the good guys, they’ll help keep pests 
in check. Turn to Chapter 9 to learn about diseases and to 
Chapter 10 for information about animal pests. Weeds can 
be among the biggest headaches for organic gardeners; 
Chapter 11 gives you the tools you need to take control.

M
ost discussions of garden pests are full of warfare terms such as 
battle, enemy, and defeat. It’s easy to understand this attitude when 
you see your rose blossoms ravaged by Japanese beetles or your cabbages 
full of cabbageworm holes. Then, even the most eco-friendly gardener is 
tempted to reach for the nearest insecticide! But for organic gardeners, pest 
management isn’t just about killing pests. It’s also about taking steps to 
prevent pest problems and choosing nontoxic pest control methods before 
resorting to sprays.
This chapter introduces you to integrated pest management and explains 
how you can use it to create a healthy, productive garden. And because 
many pesticides — even organic ones — can be harmful if misused, there’s a 
section on using pesticides safely.
Dealing with Pests the Organic Way: 
Integrated Pest Management
Spraying pesticides to get rid of pests may be satisfying in the moment, 
but the long-term effects can include poisoning soil and water; creating an 
unhealthy environment for yourself, your family, and your pets; eliminating 
beneficial organisms; and wasting money on unnecessary products. Organic 
gardeners take a different approach: They strive to maintain a healthy bal-
ance of organisms, and they treat problems only when treatment is clearly 
warranted. The goal is to manage pests, not annihilate them.

96
Part III: Managing Pests 
When it comes to pest management, organic gardeners heed two basic 
tenets:
 
✓ Pesticides aren’t always the answer: Organic gardeners consider 
whether it’s really necessary to control the pests they find. A few aphids 
on your hibiscus aren’t likely to cause any major damage if your garden 
is a haven for beneficial insects that dine on aphids. As a matter of fact, 
organic gardeners try not to eliminate all insect pests, because if all the 
pests disappear, so will the insects, birds, and spiders that feed on them. 
By tolerating a small number of pests, you can keep their predators 
around in case your garden has a sudden pest-population explosion. 
 
✓ Not all problems are pest problems: Avoid the temptation to assume that 
all problems are caused by pests. Other factors may be at fault: excessive 
heat, not enough or too much sun, lack of or too much moisture, herbicide 
drift, freezing temperatures, hail, wind, air and water pollution, and mower 
and string-trimmer injury, for example. These problems are especially likely 
in plants growing in unfavorable environments — shade-loving plants in full 
sun, for example. Plants stressed by these factors are also more vulnerable 
to insect and disease attack. Eliminating the environmental stress solves 
the underlying problem, which in turn may make pesticides unnecessary.
When problems arise in your garden, you need a methodical and environment-
ally sound way to deal with them. That’s where the concept of integrated pest 
management (IPM) comes in. Although not strictly an organic approach, IPM 
outlines logical steps that you can use to keep your garden and landscape 
healthy.
In IPM, farmers and gardeners follow a series of graduated steps, starting 
with good growing practices and establishing acceptable levels of damage. 
Control starts with least-toxic methods and moves to more-toxic or invasive 
steps only when needed. 
Start with pest-resistant plants
Plant breeders work constantly to introduce more varieties, or plant selec-
tions, with characteristics different from those of the original species. One 
of the most important factors that breeders look for in a variety is disease 
resistance — the ability of a plant to remain unaffected (or only slightly dam-
aged) by a particular disease. Many modern plant varieties resist devastating 
plant diseases, such as the potato blight that led to the Irish famine of the 
mid-nineteenth century and the apple scab fungus that disfigures fruits and 
foliage.

97
 Chapter 7: Pest Control and Pesticide Safety 101
Breeders have introduced resistance to insect pests, too. If squash borers 
are a problem in your garden, for example, look for squash varieties listed 
as resistant or tolerant to this common pest. If deer repeatedly ravage your 
garden, look for plants touted as deer resistant (although deer will eat almost 
anything if they’re hungry enough).
 
It helps to know which pests are most likely to affect the plants that you want 
to grow. I mention these potential problems in the plant descriptions in Part 
IV. Catalog write-ups often mention pest resistance as well, because it’s a good 
selling point.
Make the garden less inviting to pests
Your garden may be rolling out the red carpet for pests unintentionally. Most 
pests are opportunists that take advantage of weak or stressed plants and 
take up residence where the eating is easy.
Put the right plant in the right place
Choose the best location for each plant, taking into account its particular 
needs for water, sunlight, and nutrients. Plants emit a chemical signal when 
they are weakened, and pests get the message loud and clear. Although 
experts continue to debate the degree to which stress affects human health, 
in the plant kingdom, no such quibbling exists. When plants don’t get their 
needs met, they become stressed, and the longer the stressful situation con-
tinues, the greater the decline in plant health. Even a healthy plant can fall 
prey to pests, of course, but it will be better able to survive the attack than a 
plant that is already weakened by stress.
Confuse pests with mixed plantings
Insects have chemical receptors that help them zero in on their favorite 
foods, making your 50-foot row of squash plants look like a giant billboard 
flashing the message “Squash plants here; come and get ’em!” So plant 
smaller patches of each crop and scatter the patches throughout the garden 
or yard. Combining different types of plants in your garden instead of plant-
ing each crop in large blocks makes it harder for insects to find all the plants. 
Diseases are less likely to spread in mixed plantings, too.
Keep time on your side
Young plants, with their tender, succulent stems, are easy prey for pests. As 
plants mature, their tissues become more fibrous and less prone to damage. 
Use this to your advantage: Plant a crop so that it’s growing strong by the 

98
Part III: Managing Pests 
time the predominant pest insect hatches. In some regions of the North, for 
example, early plantings of corn can avert corn earworm and fall armyworm, 
which migrate from the South and arrive in the North later in the season. You 
can also time your plantings for a couple of weeks after the pest eggs hatch 
so that the young larvae will die from lack of food before your plants are up 
and growing.
 
Pests emerge earlier in the season if local temperatures have been high and 
later if temperatures have been cool. Farmers and other agriculture experts 
use these temperature records to predict the emergence of key pests — when 
the pests emerge from their winter hiding places. Talk to local growers and 
your local extension office about pest-emergence predictions and recom-
mended planting times. Some extension Web sites offer weekly pest-emergence 
updates during the growing season.
Avoid opening wounds
Like an open skin wound, damaged bark or foliage provides an ideal entry 
point for diseases and insects. Even torn leaves caused by a thunderstorm 
provide an opening for invasion. Although you can’t lessen the ravages of 
weather, you can protect plants from mechanical damage caused by string 
trimmers and rotary tillers. Encircling trees, shrubs, and perennial beds with 
a wide band of mulch helps keep power equipment away from the plants. 
Make sure that mower blades are sharp so that they make straight, clean 
cuts, rather than leaving ragged edges on grass blades.
Rotate crops
Moving each vegetable crop to a new location in the garden every year can 
help foil pests. At the end of the season, many insects leave eggs or pupae 
in the soil near their favorite host plants. If the young emerge in the spring 
and find their favorite food there again, they will have a feeding frenzy. If, on 
the other hand, their food is now on the other side of the garden, they may 
starve before they find it. Also, diseases can build up in the soil to infect the 
same crops each year. Crop rotation is easy with annual flowers and vegeta-
bles that you replant each year.
Don’t overfertilize
It’s easy to end up applying too much fertilizer in the mistaken belief that if 
a little is good, more is better. Unfortunately, excess nutrients are as harm-
ful to plants as nutrient deficiency is. Excess nitrogen, for example, causes 
stems and leaves to grow rapidly, producing juicy growth that’s a delicacy 
for aphids and spider mites because it’s easy to puncture and consume. An 
imbalance of phosphorus encourages egg production in spider mites.

99
 Chapter 7: Pest Control and Pesticide Safety 101
The easiest way to prevent nutrient imbalances is to provide nutrients in the 
form of organic matter and organic fertilizers, which make nutrients available 
gradually. Refer to Chapter 6 for information on organic fertilizers.
Clean up debris
Fallen leaves, dropped fruit, and other debris can harbor insects and dis-
eases, so during the season and at season’s end, pick up and destroy fallen 
fruit, and turn plant residues into the soil or add them to your compost pile. 
Dispose of diseased plants in the trash or add them to a compost pile that 
reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultivate the soil to work in any debris that 
could shelter insects through the winter. Cultivating also exposes hiding 
pests to cold temperatures and predators.
Invite beneficial organisms
Spiders, birds, toads, and a whole host of insects prey on garden pests. Make 
your garden and landscape an attractive place for them, and they’ll do much 
of your pest-control work for you. Find out more about beneficial organisms 
later in this chapter.
Identify culprits
Even the most accomplished and diligent organic gardeners face pest 
problems. The first step in managing a specific pest is identifying it.
 
Just because an insect shows up on a plant doesn’t mean that it’s a pest. Ants 
and spiders, for example, may take up residence on plants, but they’re gener-
ally harmless. Always take the time to research pests and make a positive ID. 
Use a field guide to identify insects so that you don’t inadvertently destroy 
beneficial ones.
If you think your plant is being attacked by a pest, give the entire plant a 
once-over. Where is the damage? Is it all over or confined to one area? Is dis-
coloration all over the plant, or does the damage occur in distinct locations? 
What type of plant is it? Are nearby plants also affected? If so, what types?
Next, examine the plant up close. Check the tops and bottoms of leaves, 
looking for insects, caterpillars, and egg masses. Look carefully at the new 
growth — a common gathering place for insect pests. As you touch the 
leaves, watch for scurrying or flying insects. Examine the plants at differ-
ent times of day, and try to catch the pests in action. Jot down notes, take 
photos, or collect samples so that you can research possible culprits.

100
Part III: Managing Pests 
Do you see lesions on the leaves? A disease may be the cause. Note the size, 
color, and shape of the spots. Look at the spots’ margins. Are the edges 
of the spots distinct or fuzzy? Note whether the lesions are on the top or 
bottom of leaf surfaces, and whether they’re all over the plant or confined to 
one area. Are the flowers and fruit also affected?
If only the lower leaves on a plant are chewed, you may be dealing with an 
animal pest. Different animals can reach different heights, so measure how 
high up the plant the damage occurs.
Chapters 8 through 11 identify common garden pests, so you may find your 
culprit in those chapters. If not, consult regional field guides and extension 
publications. After you identify the pest, learn as much as possible about 
when it appears and on which plants, what factors contribute to its abun-
dance, what kind of damage it does, and at what life stage it is easiest to con-
trol. Controls are more effective if you catch the pest in the most vulnerable 
part of its life cycle. 
Establish thresholds
One of the most challenging steps in integrated pest management is deter-
mining whether control of a pest is really necessary. Resist the temptation to 
react immediately with a pesticide; analyze the situation first. Do you see a 
few scattered insects or a cast of thousands? After you spot a particular pest 
or symptoms of its damage, examine similar plants in your garden to deter-
mine the extent of the population and its distribution. Is the damage located 
on the leaves of a plant you’ll be harvesting in a week or two? Is the damage 
purely cosmetic? Control measures may not be warranted. 
In IPM, this process is called establishing damage thresholds, and it’s fundamental 
to organic gardening. Small populations of pests may not cause enough damage 
to warrant control, and they may provide a consistent supply of food for the 
predators that keep them in check. Kill all the pests, and their predators will 
leave too. When the next population of pests arises, the predators will be gone.
Some pests multiply quickly, however, so keep a close eye on plants so that 
pests don’t get out of hand. Aphids, for example, are remarkably prolific: a 
single aphid, for example, can produce 5.9 billion offspring in 6 weeks. That’s 
a lot of aphids!

101
 Chapter 7: Pest Control and Pesticide Safety 101
Choose a control method
Once you decide to take action, you need to choose your control method. 
Organic gardeners use a variety of techniques to manage pests, starting with 
the least toxic and least disruptive to the garden ecosystem. The following 
sections provide an overview of the various controls available to organic 
gardeners. In Chapters 8 through 11, you find more details on controlling 
specific pests.
Physical controls
One of the simplest ways to keep pests from attacking plants is to keep the 
two apart. The following control methods involve preventing pests from 
reaching plants and removing the ones that do take up residence:
 
✓ Barriers: Use barriers as your first line of defense against pests. They 
keep pests away from plants before they can do any damage. Fences are 
the obvious solution for animal pests such as deer and woodchucks. 
Row covers protect young crops from insect attack. Bird netting keeps 
birds from eating your berries. The color insert shows barriers in action.
 
✓ Handpicking: For some gardeners, removing pests, such as Japanese 
beetles and slugs, by hand is a satisfying endeavor, not to mention an 
easy, nontoxic solution. For the squeamish, battery-powered, handheld 
bug vacuums are available.
 
✓ Hosing off: Small insects such as aphids and spider mites are easily 
dislodged by a spray from the hose. Often, washing plants every few 
days is enough to keep these pests in check.
 
✓ Repellents: You can keep pests at bay by using substances that are 
unappealing to them. Deer, for example, may avoid trees in which bags 
of human hair or fragrant soaps are hanging, and neem oil is reputed to 
repel Japanese beetles. You may need to try several repellents or rotate 
them to keep pests away.
 
✓ Scare tactics: Shiny Mylar balloons may frighten birds, at least long 
enough for you to gather your fruit harvest. Motion detector-activated 
sprinklers can scare off raccoons, deer, and cats.
 
✓ Trapping: You can use traps in two ways: set them out to detect the first 
appearance of a pest so you can start preventive measures, or use them 
to reduce pest populations. Popular traps include sticky red spheres for 
apple maggots and hanging traps for Japanese beetles.

102
Part III: Managing Pests 
Biological controls
Biological controls use living agents to control pests. Although the term 
can technically refer any organism that kills pests, it most often refers to 
products containing microscopic organisms (usually bacteria or fungi) that 
we apply to plants. Larger predators of garden pests, such as ladybugs and 
toads, are usually called “beneficials” and are addressed in the following sec-
tion, “The Benefits of Beneficials.”
Most organic gardeners are familiar with Bt (short for Bacillus thuringiensis), 
a strain of bacteria used to control pest caterpillars. Other biological con-
trols include milky spore disease and parasitic nematodes, both of which 
are used to control Japanese beetle grubs. Some of the biggest innovations 
in pest control are coming in the field of biological controls. Manufacturers 
have introduced products containing Streptomyces griseoviridis, a species of 
soil bacteria that colonizes roots and helps prevent disease organisms from 
infecting the plants. In light of recent bans on common synthetic pesticides, 
we’re likely to see more and more biologically based pesticides introduced.
Other controls
A huge range of pesticide sprays and dusts is available to gardeners. Organic 
growers choose products that are the least toxic and most targeted to the 
pests they want to control. Insecticidal soap and horticultural oil are two 
mainstays. Look for more detailed information on pest-control products in 
Chapters 8 through 11.
The Benefits of Beneficials
Sometimes, the best control is right under your nose. Many familiar garden 
denizens are voracious eaters of the pests we’re trying to control. We just 
need to invite them to dine. The following sections help you sort out the 
good from the bad and give you tips for keeping the good guys where you 
want them: in your garden.
Identifying beneficial insects
Insects that prey on or parasitize insect pests are called beneficial insects. 
Whether you know it or not, you rely on these allies to help keep the insect 
balance from tipping too far in the destructive direction. If you familiar-
ize yourself with these good guys, you can encourage their presence in the 
garden and avoid killing these innocent bystanders just because they happen 
to be the insects you spy on your favorite dahlias.

103
 Chapter 7: Pest Control and Pesticide Safety 101
 
You can buy many of these beneficial insects from mail-order catalogs to 
increase your local populations. See the “Sources of beneficial insects” sidebar, 
later in this chapter.
The following beneficial insects are worth befriending:
 
✓ Big-eyed bug: These fast-moving, 
1⁄8- to 
1⁄4-inch bugs have tiny black spots 
on their heads and the middle part of their bodies, as shown in Figure 
7-1. They dine on aphids, leafhoppers, spider mites, and some small 
caterpillars. Because these bugs aren’t commercially available, look 
for them on nearby weeds, such as goldenrod or pigweed, and relocate 
them to your garden.
 
✓ Braconid wasps: Several species of braconid wasps, shown in Figure 7-2, 
parasitize pest insects. Both the slender adults and tiny, cream-colored 
grubs feed on a range of pests, including aphids, cabbageworms, codling 
moths, and corn borers. Purchase these 
1⁄10- to 
1⁄2-inch wasps from suppliers 
and plant some dill, fennel, and other parsley-family flowers to help keep 
them around. Adults require carbohydrate food, such as the honeydew 
secreted by aphids, tree sap ooze, or flower nectar.
 
✓ Centipedes: Indoors and out, multilegged centipedes feed on many 
insect pests. Most species don’t bother humans (unless you count 
the screech with which they are frequently greeted), and while some 
southwestern species do inflict a temporarily painful bite, none are 
dangerous. You can’t do much to encourage their presence, but if you 
can leave them alone to do their job, you’ll have fewer insects around.
 
✓ Damsel bugs: These slender, 
3⁄8- to 
1⁄2-inch bugs have strong-looking front 
legs. They prey on aphids, caterpillars, leafhoppers, and thrips. Damsel 
bugs are common in unsprayed alfalfa fields, where you can collect them 
in a net for relocation to your yard.
 
✓ Ground beetles: Many beetle species live in or on the soil, where both 
their larval and adult stages capture and eat harmful insects. They vary 
in color (black, green, bronze) and in size. Although most live close to 
the ground, feeding on aphids, caterpillars, fruit flies, mites, and slugs, 
the 1-inch-long caterpillar hunter beetle climbs trees to feed on gypsy 
moths and other tree-dwelling caterpillars.
 
 Because these beetles aren’t available commercially, the best thing you 
can do to encourage their presence is to avoid using herbicides and 
insecticides. Also, learn to distinguish them from unwanted insects. 
Most of the helpful ground beetles are large, dark, and fast moving. They 
often have nasty-looking mandibles and eyes on or near the fronts of 
their heads.

✓ Hover flies: These insects get their name from the adults’ habit of 
hovering around flowers. The adults, resembling yellow jackets, are 
important pollinators; the brownish or greenish caterpillar-like larvae 
have an appetite for aphids, beetles, caterpillars, sawflies, and thrips. If 
you grow an abundance of flowers, you’re likely to see hover flies.
 
✓ Ichneumonid wasps: Ichneumonid wasps are valuable allies in controlling 
many caterpillars and other destructive larvae. The dark-colored adult 
wasps (see Figure 7-3) vary in size from less than 1 inch to 1
1⁄2 inches, 
and they have long antennae and long egg-laying appendages — called 
ovipositors — that are easily mistaken for stingers. The adults need a 
steady source of nectar-bearing flowers to survive.
 
✓ Lacewings: The delicate green or brown bodies and transparent wings 
of these 
1⁄2- to 
3⁄4-inch insects, shown in Figure 7-4, are easy to recognize 
in the garden. Adults live on nectar. The spindle-shaped, alligator-like, 
yellowish or brownish larvae feed on a wide variety of soft-bodied pests, 
such as aphids, scale, thrips, caterpillars, and spider mites. Each of the 
distinctive, pale green, oval eggs sits at the end of its own long, thin stalk 
on the underside of a leaf. You can purchase lacewings as eggs, larvae, 
and adults. To keep the welcome mat out for the adults, allow some 
weeds to flower nearby.

monid wasp.

✓ Lady beetles: The convergent lady beetle, also called a lady bug, is what 
most people think of when they praise lady beetles’ appetite for aphids. 
Both adults and larvae prey on soft-bodied pests, including mealybugs 
and spider mites. The convergent lady beetle larvae look like small, 
black, segmented pillbugs with rows of knobby or hairy projections and 
four orange spots on their backs. (This species is distinguished from 
her damaging pest cousin, the Mexican bean beetle, by two converging 
white lines on the thorax — the segment between the head and the 
abdomen. The number of spots varies widely.) 
 
 If you plan to purchase and release lady beetles, prevent them from 
flying away by setting out another food source, such as an artificial 
yeast/sugar or honeydew mixture, which is available from commercial 
lady beetle suppliers. See the “Sources of beneficial insects” sidebar, 
later in this chapter.
 
✓ Minute pirate bugs: These bugs have an appetite for soft-bodied insects, 
such as thrips, corn earworms, aphids, and spider mites. A single bug 
can consume 30 or more spider mites a day! The adults are 
1⁄4 inch 
long, somewhat oval-shaped, and black with white wing patches. The 
fast-moving, immature nymphs are yellow-orange to brown and tear-
drop-shaped. You can purchase them for release in your yard.

106
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Predatory mites: Similar in appearance to pest mites, predatory mites 
are tiny (smaller than 
1⁄25 inch) and quick. They feed primarily on thrips 
and pest mites, and are widely used to control these insects in commercial 
orchards and vineyards. They are available to home gardeners as well, 
from the places listed in the “Sources of beneficial insects” sidebar, later 
in this chapter.
 
✓ Praying mantises: Because these curious-looking insects eat as many 
beneficial insects as pest insects, they’re not among the most useful of 
the beneficial insects. Other beneficials that target specific pests usually 
are more effective.
 
✓ Rove beetles: These beetles have the distinctive habit of pointing their 
abdomens upward as they walk. Decaying organic matter is their home, 
where they feed on soil-dwelling insects, such as root maggot eggs, 
larvae, and pupae (especially those of cabbage and onion maggots). In 
mild, wet climates, they also eat slug and snail eggs.
 
✓ Soldier beetles: The favorite diet of both the adults and larvae of these 
common beetles consists of aphids, caterpillars, corn rootworms, 
cucumber beetles, and grasshopper eggs. The adults, shown in Figure 7-5, 
are slender, flattened, and 
1⁄3 to 
1⁄2 inch long. The larvae are the same shape 
and covered with hairs. They spend much of their life cycle in the soil, so 
they will be more prevalent in areas where the soil is undisturbed.
 
✓ Spiders: All spiders are predators, ridding the garden of many common 
pests. You can provide good habitat for spiders by mulching with hay 
and straw, which has been found to reduce insect damage by 70 percent 
due solely to the numbers of resident spiders.
 
✓ Spined soldier bugs: Adult spined soldier bugs dine on the larvae of 
Colorado potato beetles, Mexican bean beetles, and sawflies, as well 
as European corn borers, cabbage loopers, and tent caterpillars. The 
adults, shown in Figure 7-6, resemble tan, shield-shaped stinkbugs with 
prominent spurs on their shoulders immediately behind the head. They 
pierce their victims with a harpoon-like mouth. You can purchase them 
for release in your garden.

✓ Tachinid flies: These large flies feed on tent caterpillars, armyworms, 
corn borers, cutworms, stinkbugs, and other pests. The adult fly is 
about the size of a housefly and may hover above squash plants in 
search of prey. It has a bright orange abdomen, black head and thorax, 
and a fringe of short black hairs on the hind legs. Coriander, coyote 
brush, evergreen euonymus, fennel, goldenrod, and white sweet clover 
attract these flies to your yard.
 
✓ Tiger beetles: A variety of brightly colored and patterned, 
1⁄2- to 
3⁄4-inch 
beetles fall into this group, and they all have distinctively long legs. 
They feed on a wide range of soil-dwelling larvae. If you use an electric 
bug-zapper light, you’re inadvertently killing these garden allies.
 
✓ Trichogramma wasps: Tiny as pencil points, these parasitic wasps inject 
their eggs inside the eggs of more than 200 species of moths, and the 
developing larvae consume the host. Buy these wasps commercially, 
and release them during their hosts’ peak egg-laying times. Suppliers 
can give you more specific directions on release times.
 
✓ Yellow jackets: I know it’s hard to think of these annoying insects as 
beneficial, but they do help rid your garden of flies, caterpillars, grass-
hoppers, and many larvae by taking them home to their young. Yellow 
jackets are fond of white sweet clover and ivy, so expect to see them 
near your house if you have either type of plant nearby.
Attracting beneficial insects
You can take important steps to welcome beneficial insects to your yard and 
encourage those you purchase to stick around:
 
✓ Wait to release beneficials until you’ve seen their favorite prey in the 
garden. If beneficials don’t find any food in your garden, they move else-
where. You can purchase food for lady beetles (from the companies that 
sell the beetles) to encourage them to stay even after aphid populations 
decline, for example.

108
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Grow some plants that attract beneficial insects. With a constant 
supply of nectar, adult beneficial insects can live much longer than they 
would without it. Shallow-throated flowers are easier than deep-throated 
flowers for many of the tiny beneficials to feed from. Goldenrod is a 
favorite, attracting more than 75 species of beneficial insects. Include 
this and other plants from the parsley and sunflower families, such as 
alyssum, artemesia, aster, coriander, cumin, daisy, dill, Florence fennel, 
gazania, goldenrod, marigold, sunflower, yarrow, and zinnia.
 
 To make it easier for gardeners to attract beneficial insects, many sup-
pliers offer seed mixtures for plants that provide nectar and pollen for 
beneficial insects. See the “Sources of beneficial insects” sidebar, later in 
this chapter.
 
✓ Include a diversity of plants in your yard to attract a variety of insects. 
Choose a mix of species, including evergreens, and plants of different 
sizes and shapes. A mixture of trees, shrubs, perennials, and annuals in 
the yard provides a lot of options for food and hiding places. Try to have 
something in bloom throughout the growing season.
 
✓ Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides, which kill a wide range of 
insects, including beneficials. Even some organic insecticides, such 
as pyrethrin, are toxic to beneficials. Often, beneficials are even more 
susceptible to the insecticide than pests are, because as predators and 
parasites, they must move quickly over leaf surfaces and thus come into 
contact with insecticides more readily. Many insecticides are also toxic 
to bees. If you must use a chemical as a last resort, spray only in the eve-
ning, when bees have returned to the hive.
 
✓ Provide a water source for beneficial insects. Fill a shallow birdbath 
or bowl with stones and water, and place it near the garden. Change the 
water frequently to discourage breeding mosquitoes.
Encouraging other insect predators
Many creatures depend on insects for food, and you can enlist them in your 
pest-control efforts. Birds, bats, frogs, toads, lizards, and even small mam-
mals can eat surprisingly large numbers of insects. Offer them the habitat 
they enjoy, and let them get to work:
 
✓ Bats: Bats aren’t exactly a welcome sight around most homes, especially 
if you’ve ever awakened at night to hear their flapping wings above 
your head. But bats are often underappreciated. Their steady diet of 
insects — beetles, moths, and (of course) mosquitoes — makes them 
worth a gardener’s tolerance.

109
 Chapter 7: Pest Control and Pesticide Safety 101
 
 Consider putting up a bat house to help keep bats nearby. Bat houses, 
which look like birdhouses with entrance slots in the bottom, are avail-
able at many garden-supply outlets, including Gardener’s Supply Co. 
(www.gardenerssupply.com), Peaceful Valley Farm & Garden Supply 
(listed in the “Sources of beneficial insects” sidebar), and Bat 
Conservation International (www.batcon.org).
 
✓ Birds: If you’ve ever watched a mother bird feeding her young, you 
know that her nestlings are nonstop insect feeders. Granted, birds do 
snare valuable, soil-enriching earthworms, but they also consume huge 
numbers of insects. A house wren, for example, can gobble more than 
500 beetles, grubs, and insect eggs in an afternoon. Welcome birds to 
your yard by providing food, such as fruiting trees and shrubs, birdseed, 
suet, water from birdbaths, and shelter that includes a diversity of trees 
and shrubs (including evergreens). Put up birdhouses to encourage 
your favorite feathered friends to raise their families nearby.
 
✓ Toads: If you’re lucky enough to have a resident toad in the garden, 
consider him an ally. He’ll consume up to 100 insects — cutworms, 
grasshoppers, grubs, slugs — every night during the gardening season. 
He may even hang around for years if you make your yard hospitable. 
Toads lay their eggs in water, so a water garden or pond will ensure future 
generations. You can easily provide drinking water by setting a low dish 
or birdbath on the ground near some tall plants that offer shelter.

✓ Lizards: The five-lined skink is common in the eastern United States and 
eats a variety of insect pests, including roaches, grasshoppers, flies, and 
grubs. The Mediterranean gecko, another insect-eating lizard, is found 
in Texas and throughout the southeastern United States. Attract these 
lizards to your yard by leaving wild areas that include some brush and 
rock piles.
Using Pesticides Safely
Many gardeners rely on pesticides to achieve beauty and bounty in their 
landscapes. Although as an organic gardener you’ll choose the least toxic 
controls, you still must follow all the safety precautions recommended on 
the label when you apply organic products. This chapter outlines important 
safety information about buying and using pesticides.
Types of pesticides
Pesticide is a catchall term that describes materials used to kill pests. The 
three most commonly used by gardeners are
 
✓ Insecticides, which are materials used to kill insects
 
✓ Fungicides, to control fungal diseases
 
✓ Herbicides, for killing weeds
Other pesticides include bactericides to control bacterial diseases, mollusci-
cides to control slugs and snails, and miticides or acaricides to kill mites.
 
I may seem to be stating the obvious, but make sure that you’re applying the 
right control for the problem. An insecticide won’t control fungal diseases, 
and vice versa. Some pesticides are nontoxic to all but the intended pest, 
whereas others affect multiple organisms. Pesticides that kill a wide range of 
insects are called broad spectrum; they should be used only as a last resort, 
because they kill beneficial organisms as well as harmful ones.
 
Many people mistakenly believe that organic and nontoxic mean the same 
thing, so I must lay this myth to rest. Organic simply means that the product 
came from naturally occurring sources, such as plants, animals, and soil min-
erals. Some organic pesticides — nicotine, for example — are highly toxic 
and every bit as dangerous to humans and other animals as they are to insect 
pests. Whether you grow plants organically or not, use the least toxic pesti-
cides possible.

111
 Chapter 7: Pest Control and Pesticide Safety 101
Active versus inert ingredients
The ingredients in a pesticide that are responsible for killing, repelling, 
or otherwise controlling pests are called active ingredients. The rest of the 
formulation — up to 99.9 percent — is made up of inert ingredients. Inert 
ingredients are added for a variety of reasons, such as to make the pesticide 
easier to apply, to help the material cling to leaves, or to improve shelf life.
 
Manufacturers aren’t required to list the individual inert ingredients, but that 
doesn’t mean they aren’t toxic. In 1997, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency began encouraging (but not requiring) pesticide manufacturers to 
use the term other ingredients on their labels because a survey found that 
consumers assumed “inert” meant “harmless.”
Pesticide toxicity
All pesticides are toxic, but some are more toxic than others. Acute toxins 
poison immediately upon exposure. Chronic toxins may accumulate in body 
fat and organs, and reach toxic levels after repeated exposure.
Acute pesticide toxicity is determined by feeding the material to (orally) 
or applying the material to the skin of (dermally) laboratory rats, mice, or 
rabbits, and determining the dosage — milligrams of product per kilograms 
of body weight — at which 50 percent of the animals die within 14 days. 
The acute toxicity is expressed as lethal dose, or LD50. The lower the LD50, 
the more acutely toxic the pesticide is. The LD50 doesn’t measure chronic 
toxicity. Pesticides are categorized and labeled according to their acute oral 
and dermal toxicity as follows:
 
✓ Class I: The most highly toxic pesticides have an oral LD50 below 50 mg/kg 
or a dermal LD50 below 200. Their labels always bear a skull-and-crossbones 
symbol and the words DANGER and POISON. A special license is required 
for their use.
 
✓ Class II: Moderately toxic pesticides have oral and dermal LD50 levels of 
51 to 500 and 201 to 2,000 mg/kg, respectively. Their labels always say 
WARNING.
  
✓ Class III: Slightly toxic pesticides have oral and dermal LD50 levels of 501 
to 5,000 and 2,000 to 20,000 mg/kg, respectively, and their labels must 
say CAUTION.
  
✓ Class IV: Considered to be the least toxic, these pesticides have LD50 
levels above 5,000 mg/kg oral and 20,000 mg/kg dermal, and their labels 
may say CAUTION.

112
Part III: Managing Pests 
In addition, the lethal inhalation dose is determined by exposing test animals 
to the chemical dust or vapors, and this toxicity is expressed as LC50 (parts 
per million). Many chemicals are more acutely toxic when inhaled because 
they enter the bloodstream more quickly.
 
Toxicity varies from one person to the next and depends greatly on how 
a person is exposed to the chemical. Some chemicals have low toxicity if 
ingested but cause severe lung damage if inhaled. Other chemicals cause 
bodily harm other than acute poisoning. Treat all pesticides with respect, and 
always read the label completely before using.
Protecting yourself, the plants, 
and the environment
As an organic gardener, you have already made the commitment to eliminate 
synthetic chemical pesticides from your garden and yard. Many of the insect, 
weed, and disease controls that organic gardeners use, however, are still 
toxic, especially if improperly used. Broad-spectrum botanical insecticides 
such as pyrethrins — used by many organic growers — if used improperly 
will harm beneficial insects and aquatic animals, and can injure pets and 
people. Knowing when, where, and how to apply these chemicals is part of 
responsible gardening.
Personal safety
Before you grab that spray bottle or can of dust off the shelf and head out to 
the garden, pause to check your personal attire. No matter how innocuous 
the pesticide, you must protect yourself from potential harm. Here’s what 
you need:
 
✓ Long sleeves: Cover your arms and legs completely. If you’re spraying 
trees, wear a raincoat with a hood for extra protection.
 
✓ Shoes: No sandals, please, and don’t forget the socks.
 
✓ Hat: Your scalp absorbs chemicals easily. Also remember to cover your 
neck.
 
✓ Gloves: I use disposable rubber gloves, especially when measuring and 
mixing concentrated pesticides with water.
 
✓ Goggles: Eyeglasses aren’t enough. Use safety goggles that enclose your 
eyes and protect them from spray.
 
✓ Dust mask or respirator: Protect your lungs and sensitive membranes 
from damage. Use a special respirator with filters (available from garden 
centers, farm supply outlets, and mail-order catalogs) when spraying 
pesticides. A dust mask is helpful only when you’re applying nontoxic 
dusts to prevent inhalation.

113
 Chapter 7: Pest Control and Pesticide Safety 101
 
Most pesticide injuries occur during mixing, while you’re preparing to spray. 
Put on your gear before you get started. Always mix and pour chemicals, 
including organic pesticides, in a well-ventilated area where accidental spill-
age won’t contaminate or damage food or personal property. Even something 
as nontoxic as diatomaceous earth can irritate your lungs, and spilled oil can 
ruin your clothes. Following are other points to keep in mind:
Other toxic chemicals
Many chemicals — both natural and 
synthetic — are toxic to one degree or another. 
The following table shows the oral LD50 of some 
common household and garden chemicals. The 
lower the LD50, the more toxic the substance. 
Note the range for some chemicals, which 
can depend on the sensitivity of different test 
animals and on the way the pesticide is formu-
lated. Note: The ones marked with an asterisk 
(*) are considered to be acceptable for use in 
organic gardens.

Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Don’t use your kitchen measuring cups and spoons; buy a separate set 
for garden use.
 
✓ Clear all toys and other stuff out of the area you plan to spray, including 
the areas where the spray may drift (check the wind direction).
 
✓ Don’t allow pets or other people into the area while you’re spraying, and 
keep them out for the duration recommended on the product label.
Plant safety
Read the pesticide label carefully, and apply the chemical only to listed 
plants. Consider weather and overall plant health, too. Some chemicals 
more easily injure drought-stressed and insect- or disease-weakened plants. 
High temperatures or intense sunlight can also increase the chance of plant 
damage.
 
Relatively harmless pesticides can injure some plants. Horticultural oil, for 
example, isn’t safe to use on Colorado blue spruce and many thin-leafed 
plants. Protect them from harm if you spray other nearby plants.
Environmental safety
 
One of the reasons I choose to garden organically is to keep the environment 
safe for the wild critters that live around me. Some botanical pesticides, such 
as pyrethrins, are very toxic to fish and beneficial insects. When you apply 
chemicals, follow the label directions very carefully. Never spray or dump pes-
ticides near bodies of water; never pour them into the sink or down the storm 
drain. Mix up only as much as you need.
Also check the weather. Don’t spray or apply dust in breezy conditions, 
because the chemical may drift away from the target area and harm nearby 
plants or animals. If you expect rain, don’t bother to apply pesticides that will 
wash off before doing their job.
Keeping records
Use a calendar with plenty of space on it to write notes and record every-
thing that affects your garden. Seed-planting and first-harvest dates, rainfall 
amounts, unusual temperatures and weather events, the appearance of pests 
and diseases — everything goes on the calendar. Also note which fertilizers 
and pesticides you used and on which plants.
After keeping calendars for a couple of years, you may see patterns emerging 
that help you anticipate problems and keep them from becoming too trouble-
some. Good records show you what works and what doesn’t, allowing you to 
make informed changes in your gardening practices. Keeping records is one 
of the easiest and most important organic gardening practices that you can 
undertake.

M
ost of the insects in your garden and yard won’t harm your plants, but 
the ones that do are enough to keep you on your toes. As an organic 
gardener, you’ve made a commitment to protect the good guys and innocent 
bystanders from harm while eliminating the bad guys. To do that, you have to 
know a little about insects themselves and about organic insect-control meth-
ods. In this chapter, I describe the major insect pests (as well as nematodes, 
slugs, snails, and spider mites, even though they’re not technically insects) and 
explain what you can do as an organic gardener to control them all.
Understanding Insects
Each insect has its preferred foods and methods of feeding. Some primarily 
eat only certain plants; others are less fussy. Some chew only roots or the 
youngest new leaves; others tunnel through stems or pierce holes in their 
host and suck plant sap.
Insects also pass through several life stages, each often looking very different 
from the last. At different stages, they live in different places. A beetle, for 
example, may spend parts of its life in the soil, on tree bark, and on leaves. 
In addition, insects are more vulnerable to attack by predators, parasites, 
or pesticides and traps during some life stages than during others. Knowing 
how to identify all the life stages gives you more ways to control it. Here’s 
what to look for:
 
✓ Eggs: Each insect species has unique times, places, and methods for 
laying its eggs. Colorado potato beetles, for example, lay clusters of 
orange eggs underneath plant leaves. Plum curculios and the apple 
maggot fly lay their eggs inside fruit.

116
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Larvae, grubs, nymphs, maggots, and caterpillars: When the eggs 
hatch, they become immature insects. This immature stage, during 
which the insect eats and grows rapidly, is often the most plant-
destructive period of an insect’s life. Plant symptoms include holes 
or tunnels in leaves, fruits, bark, and stems, as well as stunted and 
deformed growth.
 
 The name of this life stage depends on the kind of insect you’re 
describing. Immature moths and butterflies are called caterpillars, for 
example, whereas young beetles are called grubs.
 
✓ Pupae: Many insects — including beetles, moths, butterflies, and flies — 
go through a stage between larva and adult when they form a cocoon 
or hard shell around themselves. They don’t eat or cause damage at 
this stage and don’t succumb easily to predators or pesticides. The 
transformation of a larva into an adult is called pupating.
 
✓ Adults: Adult insects are ready to mate and lay eggs. Most have wings 
and are at their most mobile life stage. Some adult insects, such as 
thrips, feed on plants by piercing or rasping holes and sucking or spong-
ing up the plant juices. Others, such as Japanese beetles, chew on plant 
parts. Adult butterflies and moths don’t damage plants and actually help 
pollinate flowers.
 
Many insects spend part of the year, usually winter, in plant debris and fallen 
fruit. Sometimes the easiest way to control these insects is to rake up debris 
thoroughly and destroy it. Other insects need access to their hosts only 
during a very short period; using barriers and traps at just the right time may 
prevent them from doing damage or laying their eggs. Get to know your pests, 
and you may find easy ways to control them.
Managing Insect Pests
Sharing your vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, and lawn with insects is a 
balancing act. On one hand, you want a safe, attractive landscape and a boun-
tiful, pesticide-free harvest. On the other hand, armies of marauding insects 
and other pests may seem intent on destroying your dreams. What’s an 
organic gardener to do?
The answer is integrated pest management, called IPM for short. Success with 
IPM depends on careful and regular observation of your plants, the weather, 
soil conditions, and other factors that influence plant and insect growth. 
Refer to Chapter 7 for an overview of how you can use IPM to manage all 
types of garden pests. In the following sections, I outline techniques and 
products specifically for controlling insect pests.

117
 Chapter 8: Managing Insect Pests
Removing pests manually
Getting rid of insects can be as simple as handpicking or even vacuum-
ing them. You can incorporate some of these easy techniques into a stroll 
around your yard.
 
✓ Handpicking insects: When I go out to tend my plants, I’m never without 
a can of soapy water — the future final resting place for any Japanese 
beetle I encounter. Beetles are as sluggish as I am in the early morning, 
so they can be easily picked or knocked off your plants into a can. You 
can make this an after-dinner routine as well, when the beetles have 
slowed down and settled in for the night. Use this technique on many 
other insects as well. As an alternative to the catch can, spread plastic 
under plants and shake the plants to dislodge insects. Then pour the 
insects from the plastic into a pail of soapy water.
 
 Tiny insects are difficult to pick off, but a little judicious pruning can 
remove masses of them. Aphids tend to cluster near flower buds and 
growing tips, so cutting off those portions will help reduce the popula-
tion and control damage spread. Pick off leaves that have leaf miners 
and other insects, and remove portions of branches infested with tent 
caterpillars.
 
✓ Vacuuming the leaves: Pest insects tend to congregate on the upper 
portions of plants, whereas beneficials frequently hide on the lower 
leaves and branches. You can use these tendencies to your advantage 
by vacuuming the upper leaves with a low-suction vacuum (you don’t 
want to lose the leaves too) whenever you see pests accumulating. 
Afterward, dispose of the vacuum bag so that insects can’t crawl back out.
 
✓ Giving plants a brisk shower: Simply knocking the insects off can 
greatly reduce their damage, especially if you spray plants every day or 
two, before the insects have time to make the journey back up onto the 
plant. I use this technique on houseplants too. Avoid spraying leaves in 
the evening, because wet foliage at night can encourage disease organisms 
to spread.
 
An estimated 70 percent of all insect pests spend part of their life cycle in the 
soil, which is why birds flock to bare soil looking for food. Whenever you cul-
tivate the soil, you help bring larvae and eggs to the surface, where they can 
be picked off by birds and other creatures. Keep in mind that cultivating also 
warms the soil faster in the spring and encourages insects to emerge from the 
soil sooner. I let chickens roam free in my gardens after the final harvest and 
again after turning the soil in the spring. They do an excellent job of cleaning 
up insects and leftover vegetables.

118
Part III: Managing Pests 
Barriers, repellents, and traps
Insect pests can’t damage your plants if they can’t get to them. Block their 
access with simple but effective barriers around your plants, such as those 
explained in the following sections.
Particle barriers
Substances made up of fine grains or powders can create a physical barrier 
between plants and pests.
 
✓ Diatomaceous earth: Called DE for short, this widely used white powder 
consists of the fossil remains of microscopic water creatures, called 
diatoms, and is mined from areas where ancient oceans or lakes once 
existed. The particles pierce an insect’s exterior cuticle and cause 
dehydration. The sharp particles also injure and deter slugs and snails. 
DE kills beneficial as well as harmful insects, so it may not be the best 
choice in all situations. Apply the dust to damp foliage to control soft-
bodied insects, or spread a 6-inch band of DE on the soil around each 
plant stem to control crawling pests. Some DE products contain non-
toxic bait that attracts pests and induces them to eat the dust, which is 
also fatal. Wood ashes and limestone can have the same effect. These 
powdery materials work best when dry and need to be reapplied after 
a rain.
 
✓ Particle films: Particle films are mixed with water and sprayed directly 
onto plants. One brand, Surround, is made from very fine kaolin clay, 
a naturally occurring mineral. Treated plants look like they’ve been 
dusted with a fine layer of talcum powder, so this product is best used 
on vegetable and fruit crops rather than ornamental plantings. The 
material sticks to insects and discourages them from feeding. At harvest 
time, the white film is easily washed or rubbed off.
Row covers
These lightweight air- and water-permeable fabrics were developed to raise 
the temperature around plants and extend the growing season. They can 
also keep plants relatively safe from insect pests — such as cabbage mag-
gots, Mexican bean beetles, and squash bugs — if you spread them over your 
plants early enough in the season. If you wait too long before covering your 
plants, the insects will have a chance to set up housekeeping in the garden, 
and they’ll thrive under the protective covering.
Floating row covers are so lightweight that you can simply drape them loosely 
over seedlings (to allow room for the plants to grow). Secure the edges in the 
soil or with boards to keep opportunist insects from slipping in through the 
sides. You can use light- or medium-weight row covers to form low tunnels — 
row covers supported by hoops (go to the color insert to see a row cover in 
action).

119
 Chapter 8: Managing Insect Pests
If you live in a cool climate, you may be able to keep the covers on all season 
long without overheating your plants; warm-climate gardeners need to 
remove the covers when temperatures rise. Remove the covers from plants, 
such as squash, that depend on insects for pollination when the plants 
bloom.
Cutworm collars
If you’ve ever come out to the garden and found transplants flat on the 
ground with their stems chewed off at soil level, you’ve seen the handiwork 
of cutworms. Their name is quite descriptive of their damage. These caterpil-
lars emerge hungry from the soil in the early spring, and your plants will be 
dinner unless their stems are protected. You can make cutworm collars from 
empty toilet-paper or paper-towel cores, cut into 2-inch cylinders, or from 
strips of newspaper that encircle the stem completely (but not tightly) and 
extend 1 inch into the soil. Place the collars around transplants when you put 
them in the ground.
Tree protectors
Caterpillars and other insects crawl up the trunk en route to the leaves, and 
crawl back down the trunk to rest or pupate in the soil. Catch them during 
their travels with strips of cardboard or fabric that encircle the tree and form 
a barrier. Some insects, such as the codling moth, like to hide under cor-
rugated cardboard, especially in the fall as they prepare for winter. To trap 
these insect pests, cut old boxes into long strips and wrap the strips around 
the tree trunk, with the ridges facing the tree. Destroy the infested cardboard 
strips before spring and replace them with fresh ones.
You can also wrap 18-inch-wide burlap strips, folded in half, around the 
trunk, with string securing the burlap to the tree at the inside of the fold. 
Insects become trapped under the fold as they head upward. Even simple 
wide burlap strips wrapped around the trunk collect some caterpillars under-
neath. These traps are only a temporary detour for most insects, so you need 
to check the traps frequently and dispose of the insects.
Copper bands
Copper has the unique ability to repel slugs and snails, whose slimy coatings 
react chemically with copper, generating a toxic reaction — similar to an 
electric current — that sends them elsewhere. You can use copper sheet 
metal to fashion permanent edging around your garden beds, or staple 
copper-backed paper (available from garden centers) to the sides of wooden 
planter beds.
You can also make a tree band out of copper. Cut a 3-inch-wide strip of 
copper sheet metal long enough to encircle the tree trunk. Punch holes in the 
ends for string to tie the strip together when you wrap it around the trunk.

120
Part III: Managing Pests 
Repellents
Just like there are tastes most humans don’t like, there are substances that 
insect and animal pests avoid. Like barriers, repellents are a good way to 
prevent pest problems:
 
✓ Neem: Neem does not poison insects outright. Instead, when insects eat 
the active ingredient, it interrupts their ability to develop and grow to 
their next life stage or lay eggs. It also deters insects from feeding and 
is effective against aphids, thrips, fungus gnats, caterpillars, beetles, 
leaf miners, and others. Amazingly, plants can absorb neem so that any 
insects that feed on them may be killed or deterred from feeding. Neem 
breaks down in the presence of sun and soil within a week or so. To 
discourage insects from eating your plants, spray neem before you see a 
large infestation.
 
✓ Citrus oils: The oils from the skins of citrus fruits kill a broad range of 
insects on contact. The oils continue to repel pests such as fleas, ants, 
and silverfish for weeks, and are safe around people and pets. The active 
ingredient — the chemical that does the damage — is d-Limonene; look 
for it on the label.
 
✓ Hot pepper wax sprays: The chemical capsaicin causes the heat in hot 
peppers and is the active ingredient in these botanical products. In low 
doses, as in ready-to-use sprays, hot pepper wax repels most common 
insect pests from vegetables and ornamental plants. It doesn’t cause the 
fruit or vegetables to become spicy hot but stays on the surface of the 
plant, where it remains effective for up to three weeks. Hot pepper wax 
is even reportedly effective in repelling rabbits and tree squirrels.
 
 Avoid using cayenne or other hot pepper powder from your spice rack. 
If the material gets into animals’ eyes, it can cause excruciating pain. Use 
waxy sprays, which stick to plant material and are more likely to act as 
deterrents to feeding.
 
✓ Other plant extracts: Many herbs, spices, and plants — including 
tansy, nasturtium, garlic, onion, marigolds, rue, mint, rosemary, sage, 
and geranium — contain chemicals that repel or kill insects. Garlic is 
one of the best-known and most-effective extracts against thrips and 
other leaf-eating insects: The strong odor disguises the true identity of 
the host plant, so pests pass them by.
Traps
You can use traps in two ways: You can set them out to detect the first 
appearance of a pest so you can start preventive measures, or you can use 
them to reduce pest populations. The following sections discuss several 
common types of traps.

121
 Chapter 8: Managing Insect Pests
Sticky traps
Wrap a piece of fabric around a tree trunk and paint it with a sticky coating to 
trap crawling insects. You can make your own sticky coating by mixing equal 
parts mineral oil or petroleum jelly and liquid dish soap. Or purchase premade 
sticky substances such as Tanglefoot at hardware stores or garden centers. 
A sticky substance can damage bark, so always apply it to another material.
 
You can take advantage of insects’ color preferences in making traps. If you 
have some scrap wood, paint it yellow, cover it with a sticky coating, and 
place it in the garden to lure aphids, imported cabbageworms, fungus gnats, 
and several types of flies (including whiteflies). Codling moths prefer white 
traps. Trap thrips with sticky blue cards. To make cleanup easier, cover the 
trap with plastic wrap before applying the sticky coating.
Apple maggot traps
Apple maggot traps are sticky traps (see the preceding section) that go a 
step further by mimicking the color and shape of the apple maggot’s favor-
ite fruit. These sticky red spheres lure adult females searching for apples in 
which to lay their eggs. You can make your own trap by painting any apple-
size ball red, covering it with a sticky coating, and hanging it in an apple tree. 
The larger the tree, the more traps you’ll need. Set out the spheres in early to 
mid-June, just after the petals have fallen.
Pheromone-baited traps
These traps are baited with a pheromone — the scent released by a female 
insect to attract a male of the same species. The artificial pheromone in the 
trap lures male insects, and a sticky coating or the trap’s configuration pre-
vents them from leaving after they realize that they’ve been hoodwinked. 
Codling moths, oriental fruit moths, and Japanese beetles are some of the 
insects easily captured in this type of trap.
 
Some evidence exists that putting up a Japanese beetle trap can attract more 
trouble than you bargained for. The beetles move so freely from yard to yard 
that your trap may solve your neighbors’ beetle problems and worsen yours. 
To avoid being the neighborhood lure, place traps at the edge of your prop-
erty and buy traps for your neighbors, too! Japanese-beetle control needs to 
include large areas, such as whole neighborhoods, to be most effective.
Biological controls
Everybody gets sick at one time or another — and that includes bugs. You 
can help them along the path to their destruction with a variety of infectious 
microorganisms, or microbes, that target specific pests. The beauty of these 
disease-causing microbes is that they are completely harmless to most 
beneficial insects, humans, and other animals. Microbes take time to work 
but often remain active in the environment long after you apply them.

122
Part III: Managing Pests 
Bacteria
Several insect-infecting bacteria, or Bacillus species, that exist naturally 
in most soils have become important tools in the battle against damaging 
caterpillars, beetles, and other pesky bugs:
 
✓ Milky spore: Milky spore disease controls Japanese beetles and other 
closely related beetles. It affects the soil-dwelling larvae or grubs. After 
the grubs eat the bacteria, they become ill and stop feeding, dying 
within days. They often darken in color when infected. When the insects 
die, the disease organism spreads in the soil, where it can infect other 
insects.
 
 It takes several years for the bacteria to spread and achieve good 
control, however, and they are less effective in very cold winter 
climates. In warmer climates, one treatment can remain effective for at 
least ten years. For best results, entire neighborhoods should participate 
in spreading the milky spore product.
 
✓ Bt: Bacillus thuringiensis, known as Bt for short, infects many insect 
pests, especially in their larval stages. Different strains or varieties of 
the bacteria affect different kinds of pests. One of the most widely used 
products contains the strain Bt kurstaki or Bt aizawai, which infects 
and kills young caterpillars, including many major pests of vegetables, 
ornamentals, and trees.
 
 The strains Bt tenebrionis and Bt san diego infect leaf-eating beetles, 
such as Colorado potato beetles. The bacteria are most effective against 
young larvae because the bacteria more easily rupture their stomach 
linings. Another strain, Bt israelensis, is effective against mosquitoes, 
fungus gnats, and blackflies.
 
✓ Spinosad: The active ingredient in this relatively new insecticide is 
derived from a naturally occurring soil-dwelling bacterium called 
Saccharopolyspora spinosa. It is an effective control for caterpillars as 
well as for beetles, leaf miners, thrips, Colorado potato beetles, and 
fire ants.
 
All bacteria-containing pesticides degrade when exposed to sunlight and high 
storage temperatures. Also, insects must eat the pesticide to become infected.
Fungi
Many naturally occurring fungi infect and kill insect pests, and you’ll likely 
see new fungal-based insecticides introduced.
 
✓ White muscadine fungus: One of the most promising fungal-based 
insecticides for farm and garden use is Beauveria bassiana, commonly 
known as the white muscadine fungus. The fungus lives in the soil and 
affects aphids, caterpillars, mites, grubs, whiteflies, and others. Insects 

123
 Chapter 8: Managing Insect Pests
don’t have to consume the fungus; mere exposure can lead to infection. 
For this reason, avoid using it whenever bees and beneficial pollinators can 
be affected. It may also be toxic to fish and shouldn’t be used around 
fish-containing waters. To encourage the native Beauveria population in 
your garden, avoid using fungicides.
 
✓ Endophytic grasses: The word endophyte literally means within plants. 
In this case, it describes a mutually beneficial relationship between 
a fungus and a grass; the fungus lives entirely within the grass plant. 
Some lawn-grass mixes touted as low maintenance include “endophyte-
enhanced” species. These grasses tend to be more drought-tolerant and 
better able to compete with weed species, and they are able to repel 
insect feeding.
Nematodes
Not to be confused with pest nematodes, beneficial nematodes are microscopic, 
wormlike organisms that live in moist soil. Naturally occurring throughout 
the world, they prey on many soil-dwelling pests, including ants, fleas, sod 
webworms, raspberry cane borers, and cutworms. They are especially useful 
for controlling Japanese beetle grubs. You can purchase beneficial nematodes 
from garden centers and mail-order suppliers.
Because they’re living organisms, nematodes must be stored and applied 
properly. Beneficial nematodes are most effective in moist soil and at soil 
temperatures between 60 and 90 degrees. They can be killed by exposure to 
the sun, so they’re best applied in early evening or on cloudy or rainy days 
when the soil temperature is at least 55 degrees.
Viruses
Two other groups of promising microbes include granulosis virus and nuclear 
polyhedrosis virus, which infect many caterpillar pests. Although still unavailable 
for home gardeners, granulosis virus is proving to be an important tool for 
commercial orchardists. These viruses can control codling moths, armyworms, 
gypsy moths, oriental fruit moths, and cabbageworms.
Soap and oil sprays
Insects breathe through pores in the cuticle that surrounds their bodies. 
If you plug up the pores, the insects suffocate and die. That’s where soaps 
and horticultural oils enter the picture. Disrupt the cuticle with these sprays, 
and — poof! — the insects can’t maintain their internal moisture. Soaps and 
oils kill a wide range of pest insects but affect beneficial insects, too. Use 
them with caution to avoid harming beneficial insects.

124
Part III: Managing Pests 
Horticultural oils
Horticultural oils are made from refined mineral or vegetable oils. Although 
oils effectively kill any insect that they cover — including eggs, larvae, 
pupae, and adults — they don’t differentiate between good and bad bugs. 
Horticultural oils come in two types:
 
✓ Dormant oil: Dormant oil is a heavy grade of oil usually used in late 
winter or early spring to suffocate overwintering insects such as aphids, 
mites, and scales, including their eggs, on dormant fruit and ornamental 
trees and shrubs.
 
✓ Summer oil: Lighter oil, sometimes called summer oil, is sprayed during 
the growing season to control aphids, mites, lace bugs, corn earworms, 
mealybugs, leaf miners, and many others, including tough-to-kill scale 
insects.
Read labels carefully to make sure that you have the right oil for the job; then 
mix and spray as directed.
 
Oils do have several drawbacks. Don’t use them when temperatures are likely 
to rise above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, when plants are suffering from drought 
stress, or if you have applied or plan to apply sulfur fungicide within 30 days. 
Oils also remove the bluish waxy coating from Colorado blue spruce, so avoid 
using it on that species. Follow all precautions on the label.
Some products combine oil with ingredients such as insecticidal soaps or 
botanical insecticides, which make them even more effective. Oil helps these 
other ingredients stick to the plant or penetrate the insect’s cuticle.
Insecticidal soaps
Insecticidal soaps contain the active ingredient potassium salts of fatty acids, 
which penetrate and disrupt the cuticle that holds moisture inside insects’ 
bodies. When sprayed with soap, many soft-bodied insect pests, such as 
aphids, dry out and die. Some pests, especially beetles with hard bodies, 
remain unaffected, however. To make soaps more effective, some products 
combine soap with pyrethrins, a botanical insecticide that’s described later 
in this chapter.
Insecticidal soap is nontoxic to humans and other animals, and breaks down 
quickly in the environment. If you use a concentrated product, dilute it with 
soft water before use for the best effect. Hard or mineral-rich water decreases 
its effectiveness.
The downside to insecticidal soap is that it also disrupts the waxy cuticle on 
some plants, making it toxic to young and thin-leafed plants, especially toma-
toes. If you aren’t sure of the plant’s sensitivity to the product, always test it 
on a leaf or two, and allow a couple of days to pass before spraying a whole 
plant. Follow the label directions carefully.

125
 Chapter 8: Managing Insect Pests
Botanicals: Plant-based insecticides
Insect and disease killers that come from plant extracts are called botanical 
pesticides or botanicals. Although derived from natural sources, botanicals 
are not necessarily safer or less toxic to nonpest insects, humans, and ani-
mals than synthetically derived pesticides. In fact, most botanicals are broad-
spectrum insecticides, which kill both good and bad bugs indiscriminately. 
Some botanicals cause allergic reactions in people; others are highly toxic to 
fish and animals; and some may even cause cancer.
 
Use all pesticides, including botanicals, only as a last resort and only after 
thoroughly reading the label on the package. See Chapter 7 for information on 
how to use pesticides safely.
Pyrethrins
These insecticidal compounds occur naturally in the flowers of some species 
of chrysanthemum plants. The toxins penetrate the insects’ nervous system, 
quickly causing paralysis. In high-enough doses or in combination with 
other pesticides, the insects die. The compound breaks down rapidly when 
exposed to sun and air, and becomes less effective if stored for longer than 
one year. Many commercial products contain pyrethrins.
Powerful synthetic compounds that imitate the natural chrysanthemum 
compounds are called pyrethroids. Pyrethroids are not approved for use in 
organic farms and gardens. Also avoid any pyrethrins that list piperonyl 
butoxoid on the label. This additive is not approved for organic use.
 
Although relatively harmless to humans, pyrethrins are highly toxic to fish 
and bees and moderately toxic to birds. They kill both beneficial and pest 
insects. To keep bees safe, spray pyrethrins in the evening after bees have 
returned to their hives for the night, and avoid spraying blooming plants.
Ryania and sabadilla
Ryania and sabadilla are botanical pesticides historically used by organic 
gardeners to control a variety of insects. Because of their toxicity to beneficial 
insects, fish, birds, and mammals, these pesticides are becoming increasingly 
hard to find.
 
Seek other pest controls before resorting to these substances. Rotenone was 
once a popular organic insecticide, but because of its extreme toxicity to fish, 
it has fallen out of favor. Although it may be available from garden and farm 
suppliers, no rotenone products are approved for organic production.

A Quick Guide to Getting 
Rid of Common Pests
The following list of vegetable, flower, tree, shrub, and fruit pests includes 
the worst offenders. Many more insects cause damage, of course, and you 
can get more information about the ones to watch out for from your local 
extension office:
 
✓ Aphids: These pear-shaped pests, shown in Figure 8-1, pierce holes in 
plant tissue and suck the juices. Their sizes range up to 
1⁄8 inch, and color 
varies depending on the species, from black to green, red, or even trans-
lucent. Aphids leave behind sticky sap droppings called honeydew that 
attract ants and may turn black if covered with sooty mold. Aphids can 
proliferate quickly on weakened plants and tend to congregate on the 
newest leaves and buds. Blast them off with a hose; control them with 
beneficial green lacewings, ladybugs, or sticky yellow traps; or spray 
them with insecticidal soap.
 
✓ Apple maggots: Slightly smaller than houseflies, these pests spend 
the winter in soil and then appear in June or July, mainly in northern 
climates, to begin laying eggs in apples, crabapples, plums, and other 
fruits. Maggots hatch and tunnel through the fruit, ruining it (see Figure 
8-2). Rake up and dispose of infested fruit in the fall before the maggots 
emerge and become established in the soil for the winter. Trap adult 
flies with red, apple-like spheres coated with sticky goo (refer to “Apple 
maggot traps,” earlier in this chapter) and baited with a special apple-
scented lure. Begin trapping three weeks after the petals begin falling 
from the blossoms in spring and continue through August, cleaning and 
refreshing the sticky stuff as needed. Use one to two traps in young or 
small, 6- to 8-foot-high fruit trees, and six traps in mature 10- to 25-foot 
trees. Apply a spinosad-based insecticide.
 
✓ Ataenius spretulus: These 
1⁄4-inch-long black beetles lay eggs in turf-
grass in the spring. The eggs hatch into small white grubs, which feed on 
grass roots until midsummer. After pupating, new adults emerge from 
the soil and mate; then they prepare for winter by burrowing an inch or 
so deep into the soil. Discourage the pest by reducing lawn thatch and 
encouraging predatory and parasitic beneficial insects.
 
✓ Bagworms: Bagworms are the larval stages of moths. After hatching in 
late spring, bagworm caterpillars use pieces of plant debris to construct 
dangling 1- to 2-inch-long, baglike structures for themselves. The small 
caterpillars feed on the leaves and twigs of many trees and shrubs, espe-
cially arborvitae and juniper. Cut the bags loose, removing the silk that 
wraps around the stem, and destroy them. Spray with Bacillus thuringi-
ensis (Bt) or a spinosad-based insecticide in early spring, or trap adults 
with sticky pheromone traps.

127

got larvae.
 
 
✓ Bean leaf beetles: Adult beetles, shown in Figure 8-3, chew large holes in 
bean leaves, and the larvae attack the roots. Control by covering plants 
with row-cover fabric. Spray with the organic pesticide neem as a last 
resort.

128
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
Figure 8-3: 
Adult bean 
leaf beetles.
 
 
✓ Billbugs: The adult beetles have long snouts and eat turfgrass leaves, 
while the grubs consume the grass roots and lower stems. They’re 
especially fond of zoysia and Bermuda grasses. Control by planting tall 
fescue and perennial ryegrass varieties that contain endophytes.
 
 Don’t use these grasses where horses, cattle, and sheep will graze, 
because endophytes produce a toxin that affects animals as well as 
insect pests.
 
✓ Black vine weevils: Both adults and larvae of this snout-nosed beetle 
species damage fruit and ornamental plants. The 
1⁄3-inch-long black 
adults emerge from the soil in early summer and lay eggs near the soil 
on host plants. When the eggs hatch, the larvae burrow into the soil 
and eat the roots. Meanwhile, the adults eat crescent-shaped notches in 
the leaves. Control by covering crops with floating row-cover fabric to 
screen out adults or by knocking the adults off the plants onto a drop-
cloth in the evening. Use beneficial nematodes for the larval and pupal 
stages.
 
✓ Borers: Some beetle and moth larvae tunnel into the wood, canes, and 
stems of raspberries, roses, rhododendrons, squash, fruit trees, and 
other ornamental trees and shrubs, as shown in Figure 8-4. The tunnel-
ing weakens the plant and makes it more disease-prone, and can cut off 

129
 Chapter 8: Managing Insect Pests
sap circulation, causing wilting and twig or cane death. Prevent borers 
by choosing plant species that are less susceptible, wrapping the trunks 
of young trees to prevent sunburn or other wounds where borers can 
attack, and covering susceptible vegetable crops with floating row-
cover fabric. Watch for signs of damage, including dead bark, sawdust 
piles, dead or wilted canes and limbs, and poor performance. Control 
by slitting open affected stems and killing the larvae or pruning off and 
destroying stems. If you find borers or bark beetles, cut off and destroy 
the severely infested limbs, inject beneficial nematodes into the remain-
ing borer holes, and remove dead or dying trees and plants.
 
✓ Cabbage loopers: The 1-inch-long, gray, adult moths lay eggs on cab-
bages, broccoli, cauliflower, and similar types of crops in late spring to 
early summer. The bright green caterpillars have white stripes down each 
side of their bodies and move with a looping motion. Control by handpick-
ing the caterpillars, encouraging beneficial wasps, and spraying Bt.
 
✓ Chinch bugs: Both the immature nymphs and the black-and-white, 
1⁄6-inch-long, winged, adult bugs cause significant damage to lawns and 
grain crops by sucking the juice from grasses. Irregular patches of lawn 
turn brown, and you may detect a foul odor from crushed bugs when 
you walk over the affected areas. Control by planting endophyte-con-
taining grasses and encouraging beneficial predator insects by allowing 
clover to grow in your lawn.

Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Codling moths: This 
1⁄2-inch-long brown moth lays its eggs on the leaves 
and twigs of apples and other fruits, starting when the trees’ flower 
petals begin falling in the spring and continuing through the summer. 
When the caterpillars hatch, they tunnel through the center of the fruit, 
as shown in Figure 8-5. Control adult codling moths by trapping, killing, 
or confusing them with sticky pheromone-baited traps. Immature larvae 
spend the winter under the loose bark of fruit trees and in fallen apples. 
Spray trees with horticultural oil in early spring before the leaves 
emerge to smother the larvae. You can also trap the larvae by wrap-
ping corrugated cardboard around the tree trunks in summer and then 
destroying it after the insects crawl inside. Monitor and replace every 
one to two weeks.
 
✓ Colorado potato beetles: The yellow- and black-striped adults, shown in 
Figure 8-6, emerge from the soil in early summer, mate, and lay orange 
eggs on the undersides of potato-family leaves, such as potato, eggplant, 
tomato, tomatillo, and nightshade. Both adults and larvae defoliate 
potato-family crops quickly. The reddish grubs devour the plant leaves 
and then develop into beetles, which lay a second generation of eggs 
later in the summer. The adults spend the winter in the soil and in plant 
debris. Control by encouraging spiders, lady beetles, predatory stink-
bugs, and tachinid flies. Cover plants by applying a floating row cover or 
straw mulch, handpicking adults, crushing egg clusters, and spraying Bt 
san diego or a spinosad-based insecticide on very young grubs.
 
✓ Corn earworms and tomato fruitworms: This caterpillar is one and the 
same critter, but its name changes depending on the crop it’s damag-
ing. The adult moths emerge in spring to lay their eggs on plant leaves 
and corn ears. The caterpillars burrow into the fruit or eat the leaves for 
up to a month before dropping to the soil to pupate. Control in corn by 
choosing resistant varieties with tight husks on their ears or by applying 
soybean oil mixed with Bt or spinosad to the corn silks. Handpick from 
other fruits and vegetables, encourage beneficial bugs and wasps, or 
spray with neem. In warm regions, the pupae overwinter in the soil; light 
tilling exposes them to predators. In colder regions, the moths migrate 
in fall.
 
✓ Cucumber beetles: Striped and spotted cucumber beetle species, shown 
in Figure 8-7, cause significant damage by chewing large holes in the 
leaves, roots, and fruit of vegetables such as squash, corn, beans, and 
peas. They can also carry viral and bacterial wilt diseases, spreading the 
diseases throughout your garden. Both adults and larvae feed on plants. 
Control by covering plants with row covers until they flower to prevent 
adults from laying eggs. Remove plant residue from the garden to elimi-
nate winter hiding places. Use beneficial nematodes to control grubs 
in the soil; use a particle film barrier like Surround WP to confuse the 
adults and discourage feeding.

Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Cutworms and armyworms: The 1- to 2-inch-long cutworm caterpil-
lars, shown in Figure 8-8, chew through the stems of young plants at 
night, killing them, and then spend the day curled in the soil nearby. 
Armyworms also feed at night, usually in early summer, stripping the 
leaves from grasses, grains, and vegetable crops. Control by picking the 
caterpillars from the soil near decimated seedlings and spraying Bt or 
spinosad to kill caterpillars. Spray horticultural oil in midsummer to kill 
the eggs on host plants. Remove plant debris from gardens to prevent 
overwintering by adults. Wrap the stems of young vegetable plants with 
2- to 3-inch-wide strips of newspaper so that half the paper extends 
below the soil surface.
 
✓ Flea beetles: The highly mobile, shiny blackish beetles are only 
1⁄10 inch 
long, but they tend to feed in large groups, skeletonizing leaves in a few 
days’ time. Adults emerge in spring and do most of their damage by mid-
summer. Eggs, laid in the soil, hatch into larvae that eat plant roots until 
late summer. Control by covering vegetables and susceptible flowering 
plants with row-cover fabric or delaying plantings until the beetles sub-
side. Beneficial nematodes attack the grubs. You can also vacuum them 
up with a small handheld vacuum cleaner early in the morning, while 
they’re still sluggish. A particle film barrier like Surround WP may dis-
courage feeding.
 
✓ Gypsy moths: The adult moths lay masses of eggs under a fuzzy cover-
ing on trees and other surfaces in autumn. The caterpillars are 2 inches 
long, and are gray with brown hairs and distinctive red and blue spots 
(see Figure 8-9). They emerge in spring to eat the foliage on several spe-
cies of shade trees, including oaks. This pest spreads across the country 
as the caterpillars and egg clusters hitchhike on cars, campers, trains, 
and trucks. Catch caterpillars as they attempt to crawl up tree trunks by 
using a sticky pest barrier wrapped around the tree. Spray the caterpil-
lars with Bt, spinosad, or neem. If the pests are severely damaging any 
trees that are too tall for you to treat yourself, call an arborist for help.
 
✓ Imported cabbage moths: The white moths have a distinctive black dot 
on each wing. They flutter around your garden, laying yellow eggs on the 
undersides of leaves of cabbage, broccoli, and other cole crops in the 
spring and early summer. The fuzzy green caterpillars hatch and quickly 
begin feeding on leaves and developing flower buds, leaving piles of 
green excrement. Control by covering crops with floating row covers 
or by handpicking and crushing eggs and caterpillars. Spray with Bt or 
spinosad, if necessary. Yellow sticky traps attract the adults.

✓ Japanese beetles: Found mostly east of the Mississippi River, the fat, 
white, C-shaped, 
3⁄4-inch-long larvae live in the soil under turf, where they 
consume grass roots from early spring to early summer. The adults — 
1⁄2-inch-long, metallic blue-green beetles with coppery backs — emerge 
from the soil in midsummer and attack plants with gusto, stripping 
leaves, buds, and flowers. Inspect your garden in the evening or early 
morning for the beetles, shown in Figure 8-10, knocking them off plants 
into a can or bucket of soapy water. To control the larvae, treat your 
lawn with milky spore disease, which takes several years to spread 
through the lawn, or with beneficial nematodes, a quicker-acting helper. 
Neem sprays may discourage feeding.

134
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Lace bugs: These 
1⁄8-inch-long insects suck the sap out of the undersides 
of foliage, giving the leaves a whitish or yellow blotchy appearance. Look 
under the leaves for their sticky brown droppings. Ornamental plants 
including firethorn, mountain laurel, cotoneaster, and rhododendron 
are vulnerable, as well as vegetables and flowers. Hose off insects or 
spray with horticultural spray oil to suffocate the pests, concentrating 
on the undersides of the leaves. Use insecticidal soap or neem on heavy 
infestations.
 
✓ Leaf miners and sawflies: The larvae of tiny sawflies, moths, beetles, 
and flies, these pests tunnel through the leaves of trees, shrubs, flowers, 
and vegetable plants (honeysuckle, tomato, holly, pine, boxwood, birch, 
and lilac), leaving discolored patches on the foliage. Control by planting 
vulnerable crops in a new place each year and covering with row-cover 
fabric in spring. Remove and destroy infested leaves, shown in Figure 
8-11, and rake up any that fall. Eliminate host weeds, especially lamb’s-
quarter and dock, but encourage parasitic wasps with carrot-family 
plants. Spray with neem in spring, when adults begin to lay eggs. Leaf-
miner damage is mostly cosmetic.
 
✓ Leafhoppers: These small, wedge-shaped adults jump from plant to 
plant, especially when disturbed. The adults and immature nymphs suck 
plant juices, distorting plant growth and spreading plant diseases. Many 
beneficial insects prey on and parasitize the nymphs. You can also try 
spraying plants with strong blasts of water to dislodge the immature 
insects. Spray neem if necessary.
 
✓ Nematodes: Plant-damaging nematodes are microscopic, wormlike crea-
tures that live in the soil. (They’re different species from the beneficial 
parasitic nematodes.) They usually attack plant roots, causing abnormal 
growths and decreasing the plant’s ability to take up water and nutri-
ents. Some nematodes also attack stems and leaves. Control by rotating 
vegetable crops, and avoid planting susceptible crops in the same place 
each year. Solarizing the soil — covering it with clear plastic and letting 
it bake in the sun — also provides some control. Planting certain types 
of marigolds can discourage nematodes. The marigold (Tagetes patula) 
variety called Single Gold, also sold as Nema-gone, has proved most 
effective in Dutch trials. Many nematodes are beneficial, however, and 
actually attack the harmful kinds.
 
✓ Oriental fruit moths: These small, slim moths produce several genera-
tions of larvae each year in the North and as many as seven generations in 
the South. In the spring, the first larvae tunnel into the new twigs of fruit 
trees, causing wilting and twig death. The midsummer generations burrow 
into the fruit, leaving sticky residue on the surface. Late-summer larvae 
tunnel into the stem ends of the fruit, leaving no visible signs but destroy-
ing the inside of the fruit. Larvae spend the winter in tiny cocoons on tree 
bark and surrounding plant debris. To control, work the soil shallowly 
around infested trees in early spring to kill the larvae, and spray trees with 
horticultural oil spray. Use pheromone traps to catch adult males and dis-
rupt mating. Attract parasitic wasps and flies with flowering plants nearby.

135

✓ Plum curculios: Occurring east of the Rocky Mountains, these 
1⁄4-inch-
long weevils, shown in Figure 8-12, cause significant damage to apple, 
pear, and cherry fruit. The female beetles make crescent-shaped cuts 
in young fruit right after the petals fall from the flowers and then lay 
their eggs in the wound. When the grubs hatch, they eat through the 
fruit, causing it to drop from the tree. The larvae pupate in the soil and 
emerge as new adults in mid- to late summer. To control the adult bee-
tles, spread out a tarp or old sheet underneath the tree, shake the tree 
to knock the beetles off, and then step on them. Rake up and destroy 
fallen fruit, which may contain larvae. Keep plant debris out of orchards 
to eliminate hiding places for overwintering adults. If you happen to 
have a flock of chickens, as I do, let them forage for insects under the 
trees.

lio weevils.
 
 
✓ Root maggots: Small flies of several species lay eggs in the soil near host 
plants or on the base of the plant. When the maggots hatch, they burrow 
into the roots, killing or stunting the plant. Onions, leeks, vegetables in 
the cabbage family, radishes, and carrots are common targets. Onion 
maggots can kill significant numbers of onion seedlings, especially in 
cool, wet weather. Control by covering susceptible crops with floating 
row-cover fabric or apply beneficial nematodes.
 
✓ Rose slugs: The 
1⁄2-inch-long sawfly larvae and adults eat the undersides 
of rose leaves and related plants in spring and early summer, quickly 
stripping them to skeletons. Handpick small infestations, or spray with 
insecticidal soap or horticultural oil.
 
✓ Sawflies: The caterpillar-like larvae of the sawfly, shown in Figure 8-13, 
hatch in early spring and devour the foliage of needle-bearing ever-
greens, especially pine, hemlock, and spruce. They pupate in the soil, 
emerging as adults in the fall. Adults lay eggs in cracks in tree bark. 
Many natural predators eat the larvae and pupae. Control by spreading 
a dropcloth under infested trees and collecting the larvae as they drop 
to the ground in late summer. Spray trees with horticultural oil in early 
spring to smother eggs and newly hatched larvae. Avoid using oil on 
blue spruces, however, because it will permanently discolor the foliage.
 
✓ Scales: Adult scale insects, shown in Figure 8-14, may have a hard 
or soft shell-like exterior that resembles bumps on plant stems and 
leaves. These pests suck plant sap and can weaken and even kill plants 
if present in large numbers. Many species secrete sticky honeydew 
that encourages fungus. Control is difficult on large trees and shrubs; 
your best bet is to release and encourage predatory beetles and wasps. 
Remove and destroy badly infested stems, and spray with horticultural 
oil. Indoors or on small plants, clean off light infestations with a cotton 
ball soaked in soapy water.

137
 Chapter 8: Managing Insect Pests

larvae.
 
 
✓ Snails and slugs: These pests feed on the tender leaves of many orna-
mental, fruiting, and vegetable plants during the cool of night or in rainy 
weather. Sometimes they’re hard to spot: All you see are the slime trails 
they leave behind and the holes they chew in leaves and fruit. They 
proliferate in damp areas, hiding and breeding under rocks, mulch, 
and other garden debris. Control by placing boards, cabbage leaves, or 
other hiding places in the garden. In the early morning, lift the traps and 
destroy the slugs by sprinkling with a 50/50 mix of ammonia and water. 
Shallow pans of beer also attract and drown these pests. Surround 
plants and gardens with copper barriers — metal strips that seem to 
shock slugs if they attempt to crawl across them. Diatomaceous earth 
and wood ash also deter them but must be refreshed periodically. Look 
for nontoxic baits that contain iron phosphate.
 
✓ Spider mites: These tiny arachnids, shown in Figure 8-15, are almost 
microscopic, but when they appear in large numbers, you can begin to 
see the fine webs that they weave. Use a magnifying glass to identify 
them. They suck plant sap, weakening plants and causing leaf discolor-
ation. They’re especially active in arid conditions. Favorite hosts include 
fruit trees, miniature roses, citrus, pines, and houseplants. To control, 
wash plants with a strong blast of water, use dormant oil in early spring, 
or use light horticultural oil or insecticidal soap in summer. Encourage 
beneficial insects, many of which prey on spider mites.
 
✓ Spruce budworms: These caterpillars cause significant damage to 
spruce and fir forests throughout North America and can severely disfig-
ure and kill landscape trees, too. In midsummer, moths lay eggs, which 
hatch into small, orange-yellow to brownish caterpillars. The caterpillars 
hibernate until the following spring when they emerge to eat the mature 
and newly developing needles. Symptoms include dead shoots and 
chewed needles and cones. Control the pest by spraying with Bt in late 
summer as the newly hatched larvae emerge and again in early spring. 
Release and encourage parasitic Trichogramma wasps. Avoid planting 
spruce and fir trees in areas where the pest is prevalent.

✓ Squash bugs: These brown, green, or gray 
1⁄2-inch-long bugs and their 
nymphs attack the leaves of squash and pumpkins, causing the leaves 
to die. They become a problem when their population swells in late 
summer. Control by handpicking the bugs, growing vines on trellises, 
rotating crops, and cleaning up plant debris before winter.
 
✓ Squash vine borers: The adult lays an egg at the base of the stem in 
spring to early summer. After hatching, the larvae tunnels into the stem, 
causing the plant to wilt and eventually die. Control by covering plants 
with floating row covers early in the season. Remove the row covers at 
blossom time. Remove larvae from infested stems and cover the stem 
with soil, allowing it to root. Butternut squash resists this pest.

and other crops, plant bugs pierce the tissues of vegetable, flower, and 
fruit plants, and suck the sap. Their feeding damages the plants, caus-
ing swelling, dead spots, bud drop, and distorted growth. The brownish, 
flattened oval bugs, shown in Figure 8-16, move quickly when disturbed 
and spread plant diseases. Control by covering crops with floating row 
covers and encouraging or releasing predatory insects. Knock insects off 
plants into soapy water in cool morning or evening hours, when bugs are 
sluggish. Spray with neem or pyrethrins if necessary.
 
✓ Tent caterpillars: Adult moths lay eggs in midsummer in hard, dark-
colored, shiny masses that encircle twigs of deciduous trees. 
Caterpillars emerge in the spring and form colonies in large tentlike 
webs on their host trees. Large infestations can defoliate an entire tree. 
Control by seeking out and destroying the egg masses in late summer, 
especially on apple, cherry, and aspen trees. In spring, break up the 
tents with a long pole, and before the caterpillars disperse, spray them 
with insecticidal soap. Knock caterpillars off severely infested branches 
with a broom and destroy. Encourage beneficial insects by planting 
carrot-family plants. Spray with Bt or spinosad in spring.
 
✓ Thrips: These tiny, slender-bodied flying insects damage all soft parts of 
ornamental and vegetable plants, including leaves, flowers, and roots. 
Infested flowers and young fruits look distorted. Leaves have silvery or 
white discolored patches on them, sometimes speckled with black. Use 
a magnifying lens to identify them. Encourage or release lacewings and 
other predatory beneficial insects. Spray with horticultural oil or hang 
blue sticky traps.
 
✓ Tomato hornworms: Once you see these caterpillars, you never forget 
them. The bright green larvae grow up to 4 inches long and as big 
around as your little finger, with white diagonal stripes along their sides 
and a black horn on their tail end. When disturbed, they may rear up 
and make a clicking sound. Handpick them and drop into soapy water, 
or spray small ones with Bt or spinosad. The large, gray-brown adult 
moths are 4 to 5 inches across and fly at night.

Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Webworms: This group includes several moth species whose caterpil-
lars spin webs or cocoons around themselves and their host leaf, which 
they devour. Fall webworms attack trees and shrubs in late summer; 
garden webworms prefer vegetables and strawberries; and turf web-
worms go after grass. Control by handpicking; breaking up nests; and 
spraying with insecticidal soap, Bt, or spinosad. Encourage beneficial 
insect predators.
 
✓ White grubs: Many beetle species lay eggs in the soil, which hatch into 
root-eating grubs. Common species of white grubs (see Figure 8-17) 
include June beetles, Japanese beetles, and rose chafers. Control with 
beneficial nematodes applied to the soil.
 
✓ Whiteflies: Resembling tiny, white moths, these insects (shown in 
Figure 8-18) congregate on the undersides of leaves, sucking plant 
sap and spreading plant diseases. Infested plants may release clouds 
of them when disturbed. Control whiteflies with insecticidal soap or 
light horticultural oil, or by trapping them with yellow sticky traps. Be 
sure to treat leaf undersides, where whiteflies and their larvae reside. 
Encourage parasitic wasps and predatory beetles.
 
✓ Wireworms: These 1-inch-long, copper-colored worms tunnel through 
plant roots and tubers, causing significant damage and opening wounds 
that encourage plant disease. Control the larvae by cultivating fre-
quently and destroying the exposed insects. Chickens do a good cleanup 
job in my garden before planting time. You can also trap worms with 
pieces of cut potato placed in the soil. Check the potatoes for worms 
every few days and discard.

W
hen it comes to diseases, prevention is the name of the game. You 
can do your part to prevent disease through thoughtful garden and 
landscape planning and maintenance. But what do you do when disease does 
strike? How can you tell whether the problem is a disease or some other 
malady?
In this chapter, I explain the most ecologically friendly ways to prevent and 
manage diseases. Then I describe the most common diseases, including envi-
ronmental problems that are sometimes mistaken for diseases.
What’s Wrong with My Plant?
The symptoms of many diseases, environmental stresses, nutrient deficien-
cies, and insect attacks may look similar at first glance. Even something as 
simple as wilting has several possible causes, including too little water, stem 
or root disease, high temperature, and stem-boring insects. Fortunately, 
most problems have more than one symptom, which helps you pinpoint the 
trouble. Boring insects, for example, often leave a pile of sawdust or drop-
pings at the entrance of the wound. Digging into the soil may reveal decaying 
or nematode-infested roots. So before you jump to any conclusions, look at 
all the possibilities. (Refer to Chapter 7 for an overview of evaluating plant 
problems.)

142
Part III: Managing Pests 
The first step in diagnosing a disease problem is gathering all the facts. Start 
by looking at overall conditions:
 
✓ Environment: Check soil moisture and pH (see Chapter 5); recall any 
fertilizers or other amendments you’ve used recently (see Chapter 
6); rule out unusually hot or cold temperatures; consider wet or dry 
weather; and look for mechanical damage, such as severed roots, leaves 
torn by high winds or hail, or string-trimmer injury. If you applied a her-
bicide recently, consider whether it could have drifted onto the affected 
plant.
 
✓ Insect activity: Examine leaves and stems for obvious pests and sticky 
residue or droppings. Dig gently around the roots for grub and nema-
tode damage. Refer to Chapter 8 for descriptions of insect pests and the 
damage they cause.
 
✓ Comparison with healthy plants: Note specific differences between 
healthy specimens and troubled ones. Check leaf color and size, as well 
as overall plant vigor. Look at the bark and stems.
Typical symptoms of disease include discoloration and spotting; sudden 
death of stems or twigs; and soft, watery plant tissue. If you suspect that your 
plant is affected by disease, compare the symptoms with those described in 
the “Curing Common Garden Diseases” section, later in this chapter.
Understanding Plant Diseases
Several kinds of organisms cause diseases in plants, just as they do in people. 
Viruses are the toughest ones because they’re incurable; all you can do is try 
to prevent them. Bacteria are nearly impossible to eliminate, too, after the 
plant is infected. Fortunately, fungi cause most plant diseases, and effective 
control chemicals are available, although prevention is still the best course 
of action.
The following sections give you an overview of diseases caused by pathogens — 
bacteria, fungi, viruses — and the ways you can prevent and control them. Later 
in the chapter, I describe specific diseases and environmental conditions that 
can mimic disease symptoms.
The fungus among us
Fungi play an important role in our lives and in garden ecosystems, and the 
number of species that cause problems is relatively small. “Good” fungi are 
responsible for much of the decomposition that takes place in your compost 
pile. Also, without fungi we’d have no yeast bread (yeast is a fungus) and no 
beer!

143
 Chapter 9: Battling Plant Diseases
 
If you take the time to study them, you’ll find that fungi are fascinating. They 
range in size from a single cell to the largest known living organism on the 
planet: a 3
1⁄2-mile-wide underground fungus in Oregon that consists of a huge 
tangled mass of threads called mycelium. Occasionally, the fungus reveals 
itself in mushrooms at the bases of dead trees. 
Like all living organisms, fungi have distinct life cycles that vary from species 
to species. Most fungi have very exacting requirements that allow them to 
live and spread, and knowing these requirements will help you predict and 
prevent problems in your garden.
Plant pathologists (scientists who study plant diseases) use the phrase 
disease triangle to illustrate the fact that plant diseases result from an inter-
action among a pathogen (disease-causing organism), a plant, and an envi-
ronmental condition. Most fungus species infect a single plant species, called 
the host plant, and most require the presence of water to spread. If you can 
interrupt any step of the process, you can prevent the spread of disease.
Most plant-disease fungi spread by releasing huge numbers of dustlike 
spores. The spores are dispersed in many ways: on the wind, in water drop-
lets, in your clothing as you brush by infected plants. If a spore lands on 
the species’ host plant and the environmental conditions are right (usually, 
moisture is present), the spore germinates and begins to grow. Fortunately, 
gardeners can take many steps to minimize the spread of these fungi in their 
gardens.
Bacteria and viruses
Bacteria have colonized nearly every habitat on Earth. They are remarkably 
durable and able to withstand environmental extremes that would kill other 
organisms. Bacteria cause more plant problems in tropical regions than tem-
perate ones; most require warmth and moisture to spread. Symptoms include 
spotting of leaves, stems, or fruits, as well as soft rots, which make plant tis-
sues watery or slimy. Although bacterial plant diseases can be controlled by 
the same types of antibiotics used in animals, this strategy usually isn’t prac-
tical, so gardeners must rely on prevention.
Plant diseases caused by viruses are often named for the symptoms they 
cause. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), for example, affects tobacco-family 
plants and causes leaves to become mottled. Viruses are transmitted on 
infected seed, through wounds such as pruning cuts, and via insects, such as 
aphids and leafhoppers.
 
Plant viruses can’t be treated — only prevented.

144
Part III: Managing Pests 
Preventing Problems
Some diseases, especially of trees and shrubs, are incurable and the plant 
values are high, so prevention is critical. Fortunately, your gardening meth-
ods can go a long way toward keeping diseases out of your vegetable and 
flower patch, and away from your fruits and landscape trees. Because the 
presence of moisture is required for most diseases to spread, you’ll see that 
many of these techniques involve keeping plant foliage dry.
 
Inspect your plants frequently. You have a better chance of preventing a seri-
ous outbreak if you catch it early. Look for stem and leaf wounds and damage, 
off-color foliage, wilting, leaf spots, and insects whenever you work among 
your landscape and garden plants.
Making wise plant selections
When choosing plants for your garden, choose disease-resistant varieties. 
Many popular flowers, vegetables, perennials, turfgrasses, trees, and shrubs 
come in varieties that resist common diseases and even some pests. Liberty 
apple, for example, resists apple scab fungus, and the President Lincoln lilac 
resists powdery mildew. One of my favorite tomatoes, Celebrity, is resistant 
to verticillium and fusarium wilts, nematodes, stem canker, and mosaic virus.
Also make sure to choose plants that are adapted to your climate and site. 
Avoid plants that struggle in your climate, moisture, sunlight, or soil condi-
tions. If your soil drains poorly, for example, don’t plant shrubs that require 
well-drained soil. See Chapter 3 for more about designing your garden and 
landscape for success.
Keeping plants dry and mulched
Most diseases described in this chapter thrive on moist leaves but not on dry 
foliage. To keep the leaves dry, follow this advice:
 
✓ Space and prune plants to provide good air circulation. Fresh air helps 
leaves dry quickly and thwarts diseases.
 
✓ Water the soil, not the plants. Soaker hoses and drip irrigation are 
better choices than sprinklers because they apply water directly to the 
soil. If you must use sprinklers, early-morning watering is best, because 
the sun will evaporate any water on the leaves. Avoid evening watering; 
the foliage will stay wet all night, giving fungus spores a chance to grow 
and infect plants.

145
 Chapter 9: Battling Plant Diseases
 
✓ Avoid working with wet plants, because diseases spread easily when 
the foliage is wet. Many diseases spread through splashed water. Beans, 
strawberries, raspberries, and other plants are particularly susceptible.
Another way to keep your plants healthy and prevent disease is to mulch. 
A thick layer of organic mulch around your garden plants and shrubs keeps 
weeds from gaining an upper hand. It also helps maintain consistent soil 
moisture and temperature, which keeps plant roots healthy and better able 
to resist disease. Soil- and water-borne diseases, such as black spot on roses, 
have a harder time infecting plants when mulch prevents muddy water from 
splashing onto leaves. To discourage fungi that attack tree trunks and stems, 
however, keep mulch a few inches away from plants.
Other ways to prevent disease
Add the following techniques to your gardening routine and you’ll be well on 
your way to preventing most disease problems.
 
✓ Avoid excess nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen makes plants grow fast and 
juicy. As a result, the outer layers of the leaves and stems that pro-
tect the plant are thinner than usual (similar to human skin) and more 
susceptible to insect damage. Use organic fertilizers that release their 
nutrients slowly to avoid encouraging insects. See Chapter 6 for fertilizer 
suggestions.
 
✓ Keep your yard clean. Dispose of diseased leaves, fruit, and wood in the 
garbage, not in the compost pile.
 
✓ Keep your tools clean. If you prune diseased plants, sanitize your prun-
ing shears between cuts by spraying with isopropyl alcohol. Oil your 
shears regularly; it helps them cut easier and makes them a snap to 
clean. Also clean your digging tools.
 
✓ Keep your shoes clean. Knock the dirt off your shoes to keep pests and 
diseases from traveling from one garden to another.
 
✓ Practice crop rotation. Many diseases live in the soil from one year to 
the next, waiting for their favorite host plants to return. Foil them by 
planting something different in each spot each year. This method is 
especially effective for annual vegetables.
 
✓ Control insects. Many insects — including aphids, bark beetles, and 
tarnished plant bugs — can spread diseases between plants. Keep them 
under control, and you’ll help prevent disease. Refer to Chapter 8 for 
information.

146
Part III: Managing Pests 
Disease-Control Techniques and Products
Preventing plant stress and environmental imbalances are the most impor-
tant first steps in controlling disease. Beneficial microbes, especially in 
the soil, usually keep the populations of plant-disease-causing organisms 
in check, but environmental factors can tip the balance in favor of the bad 
guys. High humidity and soil moisture encourage diseases to spread. Stress 
from transplanting, pruning, and insect infestation can weaken plants and 
make them more vulnerable to infection from fungi, bacteria, and viruses. 
And sometimes the pesticide you use against one problem can make another 
problem worse. Broad-spectrum fungicides (copper and sulfur, for example) 
kill beneficial fungi as well as harmful ones.
The only plant diseases you can control effectively after the plants become 
infected are those caused by fungi. Except for solarization and copper, the 
following control methods target mainly fungi. (See Chapter 7 for information 
on pesticide safety.)
 
✓ Solarization: Discussed in detail in Chapter 11 as a weed control, solar-
ization captures the sun’s heat under a sheet of clear plastic and literally 
bakes the soil, killing fungi and bacteria as well as weeds. Unfortunately, 
it also kills both good and bad microbes. Use this technique in gardens 
where disease has been a problem in the past.
 
✓ Particle films: Particle films, which are relatively new products, are 
made from fine clay particles that are mixed with water and sprayed 
directly on plants. Treated plants look like they’ve been misted with 
white spray paint, so particle films aren’t the best choice for ornamental 
plantings. In addition to reducing disease infection, the material deters 
insect feeding, and helps protect plants against heat stress and sunburn. 
One brand is Surround.
 
✓ Botanical sprays: Some organic fungicides contain citric acid and mint 
oil. They are broad-spectrum products, killing a range of fungi and bac-
teria. One brand is Fungastop.
  
✓ Antitranspirants: These waxy or oily materials are designed to help 
evergreens maintain leaf moisture during winter months. By coating the 
leaves, they also prevent fungus spores from attacking. Look for Wilt-
Pruf and similar products, and follow the instructions on the label.
 
✓ Potassium bicarbonate: This natural chemical controls powdery mildew 
and some other diseases in roses, grapes, cucumbers, strawberries, and 
other plants. It also supplies some potassium fertilizer when sprayed on 
foliage, which strengthens plants’ cell walls and makes them harder for 
pests and diseases to penetrate. Follow label directions carefully, spray-
ing all leaf surfaces thoroughly to ensure contact with the fungus.

147
 Chapter 9: Battling Plant Diseases
 
✓ Fungal fungicides: Some of the newest fungicides are fungi themselves. 
These good guys grow in the soil and into roots, protecting the plants 
from harmful root-rot fungi (see “Curing Common Garden Diseases,” 
later in this chapter). Apply them to the soil before planting or water 
them into lawns and gardens. You can also apply these fungicides to foli-
age. These products contain viable fungi, so you must store them prop-
erly and use them according to label instructions for best results.
 
✓ Bacterial fungicides: Two fungicides derived from naturally occurring 
bacteria are Serenade (derived from Bacillus subtilis) and Sonata (derived 
from Bacillus pumilus). They work by boosting the plants’ natural immune 
systems as well as by inhibiting fungal germination and growth. They 
work best when sprayed early in the growing season as a preventive mea-
sure, before diseases have spread.
 
 Another bacterial fungicide called Mycostop is made from the soil bac-
teria strain Streptomyces griseoviridis. It’s applied at planting time and 
colonizes plant roots to help prevent infection.
 
✓ Neem oil: This multipurpose pesticide thwarts black spot on roses; it 
also prevents powdery mildew and rust fungi, as well as insects and 
mites. Several formulations are available, so read the label to be sure 
that the product is labeled for the plant you want to treat, as well as for 
the pest you’re trying to control.
 
✓ Sulfur: Useful for controlling nearly all fungus diseases on leaves and 
stems, sulfur is one of the oldest pesticides known. You can dust the 
powder directly on leaves or mix finely ground dust with water and a 
soapy wetting agent that helps it adhere to leaf surfaces.
 
 Sulfur can cause leaf damage if it’s applied within a month of horticul-
tural oil, however, or when temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 
It also lowers soil pH and harms many beneficial insects. Inhaled dust 
can cause lung damage. Take precautions to protect yourself. Lime–
sulfur sprays are also available; the addition of lime reduces the possi-
bility of leaf damage.
 
✓ Copper: Copper sulfate is a powerful fungicide that controls a wide 
range of leaf diseases, including fungal and bacterial blights and leaf 
spots, but it is much more toxic to humans, mammals, fish, and other 
water creatures than most synthetic chemical fungicides. It also can 
build up in the soil and harm plants and microorganisms. Use copper-
containing products only as a last resort, and take full precautions to 
avoid poisoning yourself and others. 
Some gardeners have found that repeated sprays of compost teas seem to 
minimize disease problems, in addition to providing nutrients. Find out more 
about making and using compost tea in Chapter 6.

148
Part III: Managing Pests 
Curing Common Garden Diseases
Many names of plant diseases describe the symptoms they cause — powdery 
mildew, leaf curl, and club root diseases, for example. Some diseases attack 
only one plant part, whereas others can affect the entire plant. The following 
list describes some of the most common diseases of trees, shrubs, vegeta-
bles, flowers, and fruits:
 
✓ Anthracnose: This group of fungi can attack many plants (beans, vine 
crops, tomatoes, and peppers) and trees (dogwoods, maples, ash, and 
sycamores). Look for small, discolored leaf spots or dead twigs. The 
disease can spread to kill branches and eventually the whole plant. You 
can spread it easily by splashing water and walking through wet plants. 
Many plant varieties are resistant to anthracnose fungi; choose them 
whenever you can. Prune off affected plant parts, if possible, and dis-
pose of the debris in the trash, not in the compost pile. Fungicides con-
taining copper can help.
 
✓ Apple scab: This fungus attacks apple and crabapple trees, producing 
discolored leaf spots and woody-brown scabs on the fruit. The leaf spots 
start out olive-colored, eventually turning brown. Plant scab-resistant 
varieties. Rake up and destroy fungus-infected leaves to prevent the 
fungus from reinfecting the trees in spring. Spray with copper- or sulfur-
based fungicides during wet spring and summer weather.
 
✓ Armillaria root rot: This fungus infects and kills the roots and lower 
trunk of ornamental trees, especially oaks. Symptoms include smaller-
than-normal leaves, honey-colored mushrooms growing near the base of 
the tree (see Figure 9-1), and declining tree vigor. Trees may suddenly 
fall over when the roots weaken and decay. Keep trees growing vigor-
ously, and avoid damage to their roots and trunks. If you live in an area 
where the disease is prevalent, plant resistant tree species. Consult local 
nursery or local extension-office experts for information.
Sources of information
As consumers and farmers demand more 
organic methods of disease control, alterna-
tives to chemical pesticides are becoming more 
common. To keep up with the latest information, 
visit the following Web sites:
 ✓ Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural 
Areas (ATTRA) offers in-depth information 
on many home, garden, and agricultural 
crops, and focuses mainly on sustainable

American universities and government 
agencies (http://plantfacts.

✓ Black spot: This fungus causes black spots on rose leaves, as shown in 
Figure 9-2. Yellow rings may surround the spots, and severe infections 
can cause the shrub to lose all its foliage. The disease spreads easily in 
splashing water; it overwinters in fallen leaves and mulch around the 
plant. Remove old mulch after leaf fall in the autumn, and replace it with 
fresh mulch. Prevent black spot by choosing disease-resistant roses 
and by cleaning up and destroying any diseased leaves that fall to the 
ground. Avoid wetting the foliage when you water.
 
 Neem oil (not neem extract) is the best organic fungicide against black 
spot. Use it at the first signs of the disease, but spray either early or late in 
the day to avoid harming beneficial insects. Fungicide sprays containing 
copper, sulfur, or potassium bicarbonate can also offer some protection.
 
✓ Botrytis blight: This fungus attacks a wide variety of plants, especially 
in wet weather. It causes watery-looking, discolored patches on foliage 
that eventually turn brown. Infected flowers — especially roses, gerani-
ums, begonias, and chrysanthemums — get fuzzy white or gray patches 
that turn brown, destroying the bloom. Strawberry and raspberry fruits 
in particular develop light brown to gray moldy spots, and the flesh 
becomes brownish and water soaked. Discourage botrytis by allowing 
air to circulate freely around susceptible plants, and avoid working with 
wet plants. Remove and destroy any infected plant parts. Try a citric 
acid/mint oil fungicide or the bacterial fungicide Mycostop.

150

✓ Cedar-apple rust: Rust diseases, including this one, often have 
complicated life cycles in which they infect different plant species and 
exhibit very different symptoms in each, depending on their life stage. 
Cedar-apple rust fungus appears as bright orange spots on the leaves 
and fruit of apples and crabapples. On its alternative hosts — juniper 
and red cedar — it develops yellow to orange jellylike masses in the 
spring. The fungus needs both hosts to reproduce and spread.
 
 Prevent the disease by planting resistant apple varieties and keeping the 
alternative hosts several hundred yards away from susceptible trees. A 
related fungus, pear rust, affects pears similarly.
 
✓ Club root: This fungus infects mainly cole crops (such as cabbage, 
broccoli, and collards) and grows best in acidic soils. Symptoms include 
stunted growth, wilting, poor development, and swollen lumps on the 
roots. Practice good garden hygiene by keeping tools clean and picking 
up plant debris. Raise the soil pH to 7.2, and avoid planting susceptible 
crops in infected soil for at least seven years. Some vegetable varieties 
are immune.
 
✓ Corn smut: You can’t miss this fungus disease, which causes large, 
mutant-looking, white to gray swellings on corn ears. When the swellings 
burst open, the fungus spreads. Prevent the disease by planting resistant 
corn varieties and rotating crops so that you don’t grow corn in the 
same place year after year. Dispose of infected plant parts in the trash.

151
 Chapter 9: Battling Plant Diseases
 
✓ Cytospora canker: Cankers appear as oozing, sunken, or swollen areas 
on the bark of susceptible trees, such as peaches, apples, maples, 
spruces, and willows. The new shoots turn yellow, wilt, and then die 
back. The disease attacks the woody stems of susceptible plants, 
forming cankers that can kill infected branches. Plant resistant or less-
susceptible plants, and keep them growing vigorously. Avoid bark inju-
ries that provide an entrance for infecting fungus. Remove and destroy 
infected branches, cutting back to healthy wood that doesn’t contain 
any black or brownish streaks.
 
✓ Damping off: A problem mostly in young plants and seedlings, this 
fungus rots stems off near the soil line, causing the plant to keel over 
and die. Prevent damping off by planting seeds and seedlings only in 
pasteurized planting soil and avoiding overwatering. Air circulation 
helps prevent the fungus, too. Clean your tools in isopropyl alcohol to 
prevent the spread of damping off.
 
✓ Fusarium wilt: This fungus is fatal to many vegetable crops. The first 
symptoms are yellowing leaves and stunted growth, followed by wilting 
and plant death (see Figure 9-3). In melons, the stems develop a yellow 
streak, which eventually turns brown. Choose Fusarium-resistant variet-
ies. After plants are infected, no cure is possible. If you build your soil’s 
health so that it contains lots of beneficial microorganisms, you should 
rarely be bothered with this disease.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Fusarium 
wilt.
 

152
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Galls: Galls appear as swollen bumps on leaves, stems, and branches. 
Gall wasps, aphids, and mites infest oaks and other landscape trees and 
shrubs, causing unsightly swellings on leaves and twigs. In other cases, 
bacteria and fungi are the culprits. Usually, the damage is simply cosmetic 
and not life-threatening to the plant. Control depends on what’s causing 
the problem. Take a sample of the damage to a plant expert at your local 
extension office, or contact your local Master Gardener program.
 
✓ Leaf spots and blights: Several fungi show up first as circular spots on 
leaves of tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and other vulnerable vegetables, 
flowers, and ornamental plants. The spots increase in size until the 
leaves die and fall off. The fungi spread easily in damp weather and in 
gardens where overhead watering wets the foliage, especially late in 
the day. The best control is to remove all plant debris at the end of the 
gardening season, clean tools between uses, practice crop rotation, buy 
disease-resistant varieties, and avoid contact with wet plants. Try botan-
ical and biological fungicides first, using copper-based fungicides only as 
a last resort.
 
✓ Mildew (downy and powdery): These two fungi produce similar symp-
toms: a white, powdery coating on leaves. They infect a wide variety of 
plants, including roses, vegetables, fruit trees, strawberries, raspber-
ries, and lilacs. A different species of mildew attacks each kind of plant. 
A mildew that attacks lilacs, for example, won’t harm roses. The fungi 
disfigure plants but may not kill them outright. Instead, they weaken 
their hosts, making them unattractive and susceptible to other prob-
lems. Downy mildew attacks during cool, wet weather. Powdery mildew 
(shown in Figure 9-4) appears during warm, humid weather and cool 
nights, especially when the soil is dry.
 
 Many vegetable and flower varieties are resistant to mildew; read pack-
age and catalog descriptions carefully. Remove infected plant debris 
from the garden, and avoid getting the leaves wet. Use potassium bicar-
bonate, superfine horticultural oil, or neem oil to treat infected plants. 
Try botanical and biological controls, using copper- and sulfur-based 
fungicides as a last resort.
 
✓ Root rot: This broad term covers several fungal root diseases that cause 
susceptible plants to turn yellow, wilt, and sometimes die. Nearly all 
plants are susceptible under the right conditions, such as excessive soil 
moisture, poor soil aeration, and wounding. The fungi can survive in the 
soil for many years without a host. Prevent root rot by building healthy, 
well-drained soil. Microbial fungicides can help foil many root-rot diseases.

153
 Chapter 9: Battling Plant Diseases
 
Figure 9-4: 
Powdery 
mildew.
 
 
✓ Rust: Many fungi cause rust, and the symptoms of this disease vary 
widely, depending on the kind of plant they infect. Usually, the symp-
toms include yellow to orange spots on the leaf undersides, with white 
or yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. Susceptible plants include 
brambles, hollyhocks, roses, pines, pears, bluegrass and ryegrass lawns, 
wheat, barberry, and beans. Each rust species infects a specific plant 
species, so the rust on roses can’t infect beans, for example. Some rusts, 
such as white pine blister rust, have complicated life cycles and must 
infect two different plants — in this case, white pines and Ribes spe-
cies, such as currant and gooseberry. Symptoms of this disease include 
yellow, orange, reddish-brown, or black powdery spots or masses on 
leaves, needles, or twigs.
 
 Rust fungus: Rust fungus, shown in Figure 9-5, forms yellow or orange 
bumps on leaf undersides and is most prevalent in humid and damp con-
ditions. Provide good air circulation to keep foliage as dry as possible, 
remove and destroy infected parts, and keep your tools clean. Plant 
disease-resistant varieties.
 
✓ Slime flux: This bacterial rot inside infected trees — usually, elms, 
maples, and poplars — causes oozing and often bad-smelling sap run-
ning from old wounds or pruning cuts. No control is possible after the 
symptoms appear.

154
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
Figure 9-5: 
Rust fungus.
 
 
✓ Verticillium wilt: This fungus affects many plants, including tomatoes, 
eggplant, potatoes, raspberries, strawberries, roses, Japanese maples, 
olives, and cherries. Look for wilting and yellow leaves, especially older 
ones. In some plants, the leaves curl up before falling off. Prevent future 
infections by cleaning up all garden debris, cleaning tools thoroughly 
with disinfectant, and avoiding susceptible species. Choose resistant 
varieties, and practice crop rotation.
 
✓ Viruses: This group of incurable diseases infects vegetables, brambles, 
strawberries, trees, and flowering plants. Usually, the leaves develop 
mottled yellow, white, or light green patches and may pucker along the 
veins. Flowers may develop off-color patches, and fruit ripens unevenly. 
Aphids, leafhoppers, nematodes, and whiteflies spread the virus as they 
move from plant to plant. Viruses often live in wild bramble plants and 
weeds. Smoking or handling tobacco products around susceptible plants 
can spread tobacco mosaic virus, which infects tomatoes, eggplants, 
peppers, petunias, and other plants. Prevention is the only strategy. Buy 
only virus-free plants and keep pests in check. Eradicate wild brambles 
near your garden.
Rooting Out Environmental Problems
Plants live intimately with their environment, which means that air, water, 
and soil quality, weather, and animals can take their toll. The way plants 
respond to environmental damage often mimics disease caused by micro-
organisms or insect pests; at other times, the culprit is fairly obvious. Look 
through the following sections of probable causes before you start blaming 
innocent viruses, aphids, and fungi.

 Chapter 9: Battling Plant Diseases
Air pollution and ozone
Automobile exhaust and other pollutants contain gases that injure suscep-
tible plant leaves. Ozone gives foliage a white speckled appearance. Another 
common pollutant in urban areas is peroxyacyl nitrate (PAN), which causes 
silvery damage to leaf undersides. Sulfur dioxide, an industrial air pollutant, 
turns leaves yellow, especially between the veins. Beans, lettuce, spinach, 
tomatoes, sugar maples, pines, and English ivy are especially vulnerable to 
air pollutants.
Herbicide injury
Weed-killing sprays can drift on the wind to affect nearby plants. If a section 
of plant turns brown seemingly overnight, try to determine whether anyone 
in the area has used a herbicide. You can’t fix the damage, but if you prune 
off damaged foliage, the plant may recover. Some herbicides are systemic 
and move within the plant to kill it, roots and all, so you’ll have to wait and see.
Lawn-mower and string-trimmer damage
Mechanical damage to the bark and stems of trees and shrubs poses a seri-
ous threat to their health. Water and nutrients flow through the stems just 
under the bark, and breaking the bark interrupts this flow, causing stress, 
wilting, and even death. Even small wounds open the plant to insect and 
disease invasion. Maintain a wide weed- and grass-free area around trees, 
shrubs, and gardens so that you don’t have to mow or weed-whip close to 
them. Hard plastic or wire mesh tree guards also offer protection.
Leaf scorch
When the edges of leaves turn yellow and then brown, as shown in Figure 9-6, 
suspect environmental damage from drought or heat. Trees in paved areas 
where heat rises from the pavement are vulnerable, as are any plants in very 
dry soil or unusually hot weather. Avoid planting susceptible trees, such as 
maples, in hot, dry locations.

156
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
Figure 9-6: 
Leaf scorch.
 
Nutrient deficiency
Although most natural soils contain enough nutrients to support healthy 
plants, disturbed soil around new homes and in improperly maintained gar-
dens may have some nutrient shortages. Each nutrient has specific deficiency 
symptoms, but some symptoms resemble others or mimic other problems 
or diseases. Nitrogen-deficient plants have yellow older leaves and stunted 
growth; lack of potassium causes yellow leaf margins; and phosphorus-deficient 
leaves usually have purplish streaks or an overall purplish appearance. Iron 
deficiency, caused by high pH, is especially prevalent in acid-loving plants such 
as azaleas, blueberries, oaks, and hollies. The leaf veins remain dark green, but 
the rest of the leaf becomes yellow. Conduct a soil test (see Chapter 5) and flip 
to Chapter 6 for more information about specific nutrients.
Salt damage
Salt used to de-ice roads poses a serious threat to perennials, trees, and 
shrubs. As water drains off the roads, salts in the water accumulate in the 
soil, burning foliage and roots, and killing plants. Salt spray from passing cars 
can also damage or kill trees and shrubs. Injury appears as stunted growth, 
brown needles on conifers, and wilting. You can leach road salts out of the 
soil with heavy irrigation, but a better solution is to avoid planting within 20 
feet of a frequently salted road and to divert drainage water from the road 
away from plants. If you live in a coastal area where salty air and soil are the 
norm year-round, choose salt-tolerant plants recommended by your local 
nurseries.

157
 Chapter 9: Battling Plant Diseases
Winter and frost injury
Cold temperatures, frost, wind, and frozen soil combine forces to damage 
plants in several ways. Late-spring and early-autumn frosts injure tender 
plants as well as hardy plants that aren’t sufficiently dormant and, therefore, 
able to withstand cold temperatures. Young, succulent, actively growing 
shoots and expanding flower buds usually are the most vulnerable. Avoid 
fertilizing and pruning plants in late summer, which can promote new growth 
that won’t mature before freezing occurs. Injury symptoms include wilted 
brown leaves, stems, and flowers. Protect vulnerable plants in spring and fall 
by covering them with row covers or cold frames, as described in Chapter 13.
Low winter temperatures cause the most damage to plants growing in con-
tainers, in areas where they are marginally hardy, and in places where win-
ters bring little snow cover (snow insulates the soil and prevents the soil 
temperature from dropping dangerously low). Even the roots of the hardiest 
shrubs and trees die at temperatures between 0 and 10 degrees. Here are 
some symptoms of injury caused by low temperatures:
 
✓ Root damage: Root damage may appear later in the growing season, 
when plants either fail to grow or sprout leaves but die suddenly in late 
spring. Spread 4 to 6 inches of loose mulch over the roots of perenni-
als, strawberries, and vulnerable shrubs after the ground freezes in late 
autumn.
 
✓ Sunscald: Sunscald is the cracking of tree branches and trunks caused 
by sudden and dramatic temperature fluctuations. The sun heats trees’ 
bark during winter days, but the temperature drops rapidly at sunset. 
To protect vulnerable trees, such as citrus, paint trunks with whitewash 
made from a 1:1 mix of water and white water-based latex paint, wrap 
them in light-colored tree wrap, or use clay particle film like Surround.
 
✓ Dried-out evergreen leaves and needles: The leaves and needles of 
evergreens face the challenge of drying out in the winter without being 
able to replace their lost moisture. When the soil freezes, the roots can 
no longer take up water to transport to the leaves. Winter sun and wind 
take their toll, and symptoms include bronze or brown needles and 
leaves. Wrap vulnerable shrubs with burlap, plant them in protected 
places, or spray them with an antitranspirant that prevents them from 
drying out. See the “Disease-Control Techniques and Products” section, 
earlier in this chapter, for more information.
 
✓ Split trunks and branches: Snow and ice can accumulate on tree and 
shrub branches and split them from the trunk, toppling whole trees. 
Protect shrubs by wrapping them with burlap and heavy twine to hold 
the branches together or by covering them with plywood A-frames, 
especially if they are near a building where snow can slide off the roof or 
where snowplows dump their loads. Prune damaged limbs immediately 
to prevent further damage from bark tearing.

158
Part III: Managing Pests 
Woodpecker holes
These birds eat insects that live in and around trees, and they often make 
holes in the bark in pursuit of their prey. Some bird species also enjoy the 
sap of some trees and drill holes to get at it. The holes usually are small, 
round, and drilled in neat rows in the trunk. Unfortunately, you can’t do 
much after the damage is done. Wrapping the tree may prevent further 
damage, but don’t fill the holes or paint over them.

Chapter 10
Outwitting Critters
In This Chapter
▶ Observing symptoms and signs
▶ Determining the cause
▶ Controlling the culprits
A
 discussion of garden pests wouldn’t be complete without considering 
the animals that may plague your gardens: deer, rabbits, groundhogs, 
and the like. Although insect feeding is subtler and causes incremental 
damage over time, some of these larger critters can quickly eliminate an 
entire plant — or row of plants. This chapter looks at the most common 
animal pests and the steps you can take to minimize the damage they cause. 
Note: For the most part, the animals have been ordered from most to least 
damaging to a garden. Deer, rabbits, and woodchucks can consume a whole 
garden. The smaller creatures cause specific problems but they don’t eat 
everything overnight. Of course, whatever critter is eating your garden is the 
most serious at that moment!
 
Most of these animals do their work under the cover of darkness, so you’re 
unlikely to catch them in action. Instead, to figure out what’s doing the 
damage, you’ll have to look at the plant and scout for signs that tell you which 
animal was there. After all, there’s no use putting up a 3-foot rabbit fence 
when deer are the culprit, or installing an expensive 8-foot deer fence to keep 
out groundhogs.
Oh, Deer!
Deer are among the most troublesome of garden pests. They live in wooded 
areas but also in suburban and urban locales, and in many places their num-
bers are increasing. When food is scarce, they eat just about anything. A 
deer or two can ravage an entire garden overnight. Deer eat plants but also 
trample vegetation, and bucks rub their antlers on young trees to remove the 
“velvet” and to mark their territory.

160
Part III: Managing Pests 
Deer tend to travel the same routes day after day. If your yard is in the path 
of their customary travels from sleeping quarters to a water source, you’ll be 
spending some evenings discussing deer-repellent strategies.
Identifying deer damage
To identify deer damage, look closely at affected plants. Deer don’t have 
upper front teeth, so when they eat, they tear plant tissue rather than cutting 
it, leaving ragged edges. Deer prefer tender new growth when it’s available, 
but eat buds and twigs in winter. They tend to feed on the edges of wooded 
areas so that they can duck for cover if threatened.
Deer can reach as high as 6 feet, so if you see damage at eye level, you’re 
probably dealing with a deer, not a mutant rabbit. Look for telltale hoofprints 
and piles of deer scat (usually rounded pellets with a dimple on one end, 
about the size and shape of a chocolate-covered peanut or small black olive). 
Deer are most likely to visit gardens when other food sources are scarce, 
especially in late winter and early spring.
Keeping deer out of your garden
Deer have some quirky tendencies that gardeners can use to their favor. Try 
some of the remedies discussed in the following sections.
 
If you continually use the same deterrent, the deer will get used to it and 
ignore it. So vary your methods, try different products, and combine them 
now and then. You can use predator urine (which repels by scent) along with 
a bad-tasting hot pepper spray, for example.
Repellents
Several types of repellents may keep deer out of your yard:
 
✓ Soap: Hang bars of soap from low tree branches or from stakes so that 
the bars are about 30 inches off the ground. Fragrant, tallow-based 
soaps such as Irish Spring work best.
 
✓ Hair: Ask your barber or hairdresser if you can have some hair trim-
mings. Human hair hung in mesh bags about 3 feet off the ground may 
deter deer.
 
✓ Spray: Use spray repellents on foliage. One recipe: Mix three raw eggs in 
a gallon of water and spray the mixture on plants. This substance appar-
ently smells worse to the deer than it does to you.
 
 For best results, spray plants before the deer develop their feeding 
habits and reapply most sprays after heavy rain.

161
 Chapter 10: Outwitting Critters
 
 Avoid spraying fruit and vegetables, because you don’t want to eat 
the stuff yourself. If you use commercial repellents, follow the label 
instructions carefully.
Row covers
In early spring, spread row-cover fabric over tender new growth, supporting 
the covers with wire cages or hoops if necessary. These row covers can deter 
the deer long enough to give your plants a head start and allow time for wild 
food plants to become plentiful. Refer to Chapter 8 for info on row covers.
Scare tactics
Motion-detector-activated sprinklers may deter deer for a short time. (Just 
be sure to turn them off before you venture into the garden.) Playing a radio 
in the garden at night may work for a few days, but the deer will catch on 
quickly, and if they’re hungry enough they won’t care.
Stringing fishing line between posts scattered through your garden some-
times confuses deer enough that they go elsewhere. You’ll have to remember 
that the fishing line is there, however, or you’ll keep walking into it too. This 
option is better for less frequently visited gardens than for your vegetable 
garden.
Fencing
The only surefire way to keep deer out of your garden is to put up a tall 
fence. Deer have been known to jump 10-foot fences, but an 8-foot fence will 
deter most intruders unless they’re very hungry.
 
To ensure the success of your fence, use deer tendencies to your advantage. 
Apparently, deer are intimidated about jumping when they can’t tell how 
much distance they have to clear. For that reason, they’re less likely to jump 
a fence over a narrow, long garden than a fence that surrounds a large, wide 
garden. The two long sides appear to be too close together for the deer to see 
a place to land. You can create the same illusion by installing a fence so that 
it slants outward away from the garden. This technique can intimidate the 
deer by making the fence appear wider than it really is. You can even make a 
5-foot-fence more deerproof by using taller posts and attaching strands of wire 
above the fence, such as at 7 feet and 10 feet.
Place a circle of 4-foot-tall wire fencing around young trees, especially fruit 
trees. Make sure that the diameter of the fence is large enough that the deer 
can’t reach over to eat the twigs.
If all else fails, you may need to resort to low-voltage electric fencing, as 
shown in Figure 10-1. Place an electrified strand 3 feet high and 3 feet outside 
your other fence. Bait the strands of wire with peanut butter to encourage 
the deer to take a taste and get the message.

Deer- resistant plants
Many plants are touted as deer resistant, but if deer are hungry enough, 
they’ll eat just about anything. Still, if you live in an area where deer pressure 
is high, including deer resistant plants like catmint, hellebore, and yarrow 
increases the likelihood that at least something in your garden will survive.
Wascally Wabbits
Rabbits are homebodies. They tend to stake out a rather small territory — 10 
acres or less — and not wander elsewhere. They make their homes in natural 
cavities in trees, in other animals’ abandoned burrows, in brush piles, and 
under buildings. They nibble the foliage of almost any plant, returning again 
and again, day and night, to finish the job.
Unlike deer, rabbits have both upper and lower front teeth, and you can 
identify their damage by a clean, angled cut on the ends of leaves and twigs. 
If you suspect rabbits, look for their droppings, which are round or slightly 
flattened; think marbles or M&Ms. The individual pellets are smaller and 
rounder than the more elongated deer scat.

163
 Chapter 10: Outwitting Critters
Rabbits tend to eat vegetables and flowers in spring and summer; sprouting 
tulips are a favorite spring treat. In fall and winter, they favor twigs and bark 
and can cause considerable damage to landscape trees and shrubs. Wild rab-
bits may strip bark off of young trees up to a height of 2
1⁄2 feet off the ground; 
snow cover allows them to reach higher. If they remove the bark around the 
entire trunk or stem, girdling it, any plant parts above that portion won’t be 
able to get nutrients and will die.
Here are some techniques to foil their feeding:
 
✓ Fencing: The best way to keep rabbits away from your plants is to fence 
them out. Because they burrow, a fence must also extend underground. 
Choose a 4-foot-high, chicken-wire fence with 1-inch mesh. Bury the 
bottom foot of the fence, bending the lowest 6 inches into a right angle 
facing outward.
 
✓ Trunk protectors: Protect tree trunks with a cylinder of 
1⁄4-inch hardware 
cloth or other wire mesh. (Larger mesh works for rabbits, but the 
1⁄4-inch 
size protects trees from gnawing mice, too.) The material should be a 
few inches away from the trunk and extend high enough that rabbits 
standing on snow can’t reach above it. You can also get commercial tree 
guards (see Figure 10-2).

164
Part III: Managing Pests 
 
✓ Repellents: I’ve had good luck repelling rabbits with hair gathered from 
hair salons and dog groomers. I sprinkle it around the boundary of a 
garden and replenish it every few weeks. You can also purchase com-
mercial repellents that are made to spray on the ground or directly on 
plants. Because most of these sprays repel by taste, use them only on 
ornamental plants, and follow label directions carefully.
Groundhogs
These slow-moving rodents, also called woodchucks and whistlepigs, live in 
an extensive system of underground dens and tunnels, and they defy you to 
find all their tunnel entrances. A tunnel can extend nearly 70 feet. If you see 
a mound of excavated earth surrounding a foot-wide hole, you’re probably 
looking at the entrance to a groundhog tunnel.
Groundhogs generally stay within about 100 feet of their dens, venturing out 
morning and evening to find food: your tender veggies. They favor beans, 
squash, and peas, and they can mow down a row of seedlings overnight. 
They also gnaw and claw woody plants.
If you suspect groundhogs, scan your landscape in the morning and evening 
hours. The animals are relatively bold, and you may catch a culprit red-
handed. Here are some deterrents:
 
✓ Fencing: Groundhogs can climb up almost as well as they can dig down, 
so use a sturdy 4- or 5-foot fence, and bury the bottom 18 inches under-
ground. Bend the top of the fence outward so that a groundhog falls over 
backward if it attempts to climb over. Two strands of electric fence — one 
4 inches above the ground and the other 8 inches high — may also keep 
them out.
 
✓ Repellents: Hot pepper wax sprays may act as deterrents; groundhogs 
don’t seem to be fazed by other repellent sprays.
 
✓ Traps: You can use a Havahart trap to capture a live groundhog and 
then release it into the wild. Groundhogs can’t survive in wooded areas, 
so know that you’re probably giving the creature a death sentence 
unless you release it in a suitable habitat: an open grassy field. In most 
cases, this habitat is likely to be someone’s backyard or a farm field, and 
the property owner probably won’t appreciate your gift.
 
 Be sure to check with local and state ordinances about restrictions on 
the live trapping and release of wild animals.

165
 Chapter 10: Outwitting Critters
 
Groundhogs can carry rabies and are aggressive, so use caution around them.
Gophers
These burrowing rodents live in underground tunnel systems extending as 
far as 200 yards. They feast underground on plant roots and bulbs, occa-
sionally emerging to eat aboveground parts of those plants located near the 
tunnel openings. Most gopher species live in the western two thirds of the 
country; one species is native to the Southeast. If you live in New England, 
don’t blame your garden problems on gophers.
The telltale sign of gophers is a collection of fan-shaped soil mounds, with 
new mounds appearing daily. You won’t see a tunnel entrance; the critters 
keep the entrances plugged with soil.
Gophers are difficult to scare or repel. Castor oil sprayed on the garden may 
repel them. If gophers are a serious problem, you may want to go to the 
trouble of lining the sides and bottom of your garden (at a depth of 2 feet) 
with hardware cloth to keep the gophers out. Gopher-resistant wire baskets, 
which can be placed in planting holes before planting, are commercially 
available. For persistent problems, use traps.
 
Research has shown that vibrating devices such as large whirligigs stuck 
in the ground near tunnels have little effect. Apparently, gophers in a home 
landscape get used to the sounds and vibrations of mechanical equipment like 
lawn mowers. So don’t waste your money on these devices.
Mice and Voles
Mice and voles look similar. Both are small rodents, but the tail of a vole is 
much shorter than that of a mouse. Mice are fond of young seedlings, espe-
cially those that are growing in a warm house or greenhouse on a cold winter 
day; they’re omnivores, though, and eat almost anything. Voles, on the other 
hand, are almost exclusively herbivores and are the more troublesome pest 
for gardeners.
Both mice and voles cause damage to plants in the wintertime, when food is 
scarce and the bark of your favorite tree makes an easy meal. Fruit trees are 
especially at risk. Even during the summer, if you have a thick layer of mulch 

166
Part III: Managing Pests 
surrounding the tree right up to the trunk, the rodents can hide in the mulch 
and feed undetected. To guard against giving them sanctuary and to deter 
feeding, leave a space of several inches between the trunk and the mulch. 
If necessary, remove all the mulch around trees and shrubs in the winter, 
because the animals don’t like to feed out in the open, where predators can 
find them. Snow cover also provides a hiding place. Where voles are a prob-
lem, wrap the trunks of young trees with a tree guard made of wire or plastic.
Voles create extensive networks of tunnels that, if located under your garden 
or lawn, can cause root damage. Chewed root vegetables probably are the 
work of voles. Look for the tiny, 
1⁄8-inch-wide chisel marks left by their inci-
sors. Damage to stored vegetables, on the other hand, probably is the work 
of mice.
Voles are hard to control, but you can discourage them by keeping your yard 
free of weeds and keeping grass mowed. Surround valuable plantings with a 
fence made of 
1⁄4-inch hardware cloth buried 6 inches deep and rising at least 
a foot off the ground. Keep the perimeter mowed and free of plant debris.
Moles and Skunks
These critters are the innocent bystanders or innocent burrowers of the 
garden-pest realm. Unlike voles, moles are carnivores and don’t eat plants. 
They simply love to burrow in search of grubs, earthworms, and other 
insects. In the process, they inadvertently expose plant roots to air or push 
the plants out of the ground, in both cases killing the plants.
Moles produce two types of tunnels: tunnels that lie just beneath the surface 
and appear as raised ridges in your lawn, and tunnels that go much deeper, 
connecting the surface tunnels. It’s when they’re digging the deep tunnels 
that moles create the characteristic round, volcano-like mound of soil. Field 
mice or voles may also use the tunnels to forage for plant roots and flower 
bulbs. The best strategy for controlling moles is to control the grubs they’re 
hunting by using some of the strategies discussed in Chapter 8.
Like moles, skunks will dig up a lawn in search of grubs. Look for their dis-
tinctive 3- to 5-inch-wide pits or cone-shaped holes. They may also remove 
or roll back sections of sod in their quest. Skunks will scavenge fallen fruit, 
slugs, and even pet food. To discourage them from their nocturnal visits, pick 
up pet food at night, keep garbage cans tightly closed, and treat your lawn for 
grubs. Skunks love eggs, so you may be attracting them inadvertently if you 
put eggshells in your compost.

167
 Chapter 10: Outwitting Critters
Squirrels
Squirrels are so bold, it’s likely that you’ll catch them in the act of digging in 
your garden. These agile, fearless creatures can cause quite a problem, espe-
cially in newly planted bulb beds; crocus and tulip bulbs are like candy to 
them. They’re also likely to eat fruits, nuts, berries, seedlings, and bark.
You can’t get rid of squirrels permanently. If you evict your current residents, 
new ones will come to take their place. You can try deterrents like spraying 
bad-tasting sprays on favorite plants, however.
To protect your bulbs in fall, cover newly planted beds with chicken wire; 
the bulbs will grow right through it in spring. Be sure to plant bulbs at the 
proper depth, too, and take care not to leave any bulb debris (such as pieces 
of the papery outer covering) on the soil surface to attract squirrels. Motion 
detector–activated sprinklers can offer short-term help.
 
Don’t use mothballs in the garden. You don’t want this potential carcinogen 
contaminating your soil.
Raccoons
Raccoons like to eat pretty much anything. They seem to appear out of 
nowhere to pilfer your fruit and corn just before you get out to harvest it. 
They also eat grubs and, like skunks, dig up your lawn to find them, damaging 
plants in the process.
Repellents and motion detector-activated sprinklers may provide enough 
protection to allow your crops to ripen. Controlling grubs in the lawn (using 
the techniques described in Chapter 8) can also help. A low, two-strand elec-
tric fence, described in the “Groundhogs” section earlier in this chapter, may 
keep them out of vegetable gardens.
Armadillos
Armadillos are awfully cute until they decide to tear up your lawn in search 
of insects and grubs. These creatures can climb and burrow, but you may 
be able to exclude them from your yard with a fence that slants outward and 
extends 1 foot into the soil and 2 feet aboveground.

168
Part III: Managing Pests 
Armadillos have poor eyesight but an acute sense of smell. Try deterring 
them by sprinkling human hair around the garden or by using a low electric 
fence, described in the “Groundhogs” section.
Birds
Birds in the yard are a mixed blessing. You appreciate their appetite for 
insects, but when they nibble on the tomatoes and devour the ripe blueber-
ries, they cross the line into nuisance territory. You can keep birds away 
from your plants by draping bird netting or row covers over them, but this 
solution isn’t always practical.
Noise, fluttering objects, and anything resembling a predator can startle 
birds. Try bordering your garden with strings tied to stakes and fastening alu-
minum pie plates or unwanted CD disks to the string. The noise and flashing 
of the sun on the shiny surfaces can scare birds away. Or instead of string, 
use only a thin nylon line, which will vibrate and hum in the breeze.
You can use the modern version of the scarecrow: balloons and kites with 
images of predators, such as owls and hawks. Place them in the garden to 
convince birds that their enemy is on guard.
 
Birds catch on quickly, so change your scare tactics regularly.
Your garden is my litter box
Roaming cats enjoy loose soil and mulch, and 
frequently use gardens and landscaped areas 
as litter boxes. Laying rough-textured or chunky 
bark mulch or ornamental rocks on the soil may 
repel them, because these materials are uncom-
fortable to soft paws. You can also lay chicken 
wire on the soil and cover it with mulch.
Cats don’t like the smell of dog hair or anise oil, 
so try spreading these substances on the soil. 
Shredded lemon and grapefruit peels also deter 
cats. If you prefer using a commercial product, 
try one like Bad Cat, which contains citrus oils.

C
ontrolling weeds is one of the biggest challenges for all gardeners, but 
especially for those of us trying to grow organically. Weeds compete 
with your lawn and garden plants for food, water, and sun; they harbor injuri-
ous pests and diseases; and they run amok, making the yard look unkempt.
The organic weed-control methods described in this chapter offer new hope 
of winning the battle against weeds without poisoning the environment. 
But wild plants, as I prefer to call weeds, also offer an opportunity. They 
give observant gardeners clues about the soil in which they grow and pro-
vide habitat for helpful insects as well as harmful ones. And some so-called 
weeds are actually valued garden plants in other regions: One man’s trash is 
another man’s treasure.
Winning the Weed Wars
Weeding is not a favorite gardening activity; it’s just not glamorous. I don’t 
know about you, but I prefer almost any other chore to crawling around on 
my knees in the dirt and pulling weeds. And although my tool shed is fes-
tooned with quite a number of very effective weeding tools, I’ve learned by 
experience that it’s better to prevent them from sprouting in the first place.
Use the techniques in the following sections to prevent and control weeds 
in your landscape and garden. Choose the methods that match your needs, 
whether you’re starting a new garden or maintaining an established planting.

170
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Mulching
Just like other plants, weeds need air and light to grow, and if you deprive 
them of these crucial requirements, they die. One of the best ways to keep 
weeds in the dark is to put mulch over them. Mulch is anything that covers 
the soil for the purpose of preventing weeds, conserving moisture, or moder-
ating the soil temperature.
Many materials make good mulch. The ones you choose really depend on 
what’s locally available, how much you want to spend, the appearance factor, 
and where you plan to put it.
Decomposing mulches
The best mulch materials for organic gardens and landscapes also feed the 
worms and add organic matter to the soil as they decompose. Usually, 2- to 
4-inch layers are sufficient to do the job, depending on the density of the 
material. Take a look at the following popular mulches and their uses:
 
✓ Tree bark: Tree bark is the ubiquitous landscape mulch. Available in 
shreds or chunks of various sizes, bark lasts a long time (depending 
on the particle size) and gives your landscape a finished look. Be sure 
you’re buying real bark, however, by checking the bag label or asking 
the seller for the content. Wood chips that are dyed to look like bark are 
becoming prevalent in some areas.
 
✓ Wood chips, sawdust, and shavings: Although suitable for mulch, these 
products break down more quickly than bark and compete with your 
plants for nitrogen as they decompose. If you use these substances 
around food and landscape plants, be sure to add an additional nitrogen 
source, such as those described in Chapter 6. Fine materials like saw-
dust can compact so tightly that water can’t penetrate.
 
 Never use materials from pressure-treated wood. Although the green-
hued, CCA (chromated copper arsenate), pressure-treated wood was 
phased out in 2004, the newer types of pressure-treated wood may still 
contain substances that you don’t want in your gardens.
 
✓ Shredded leaves and pine needles: These materials are among the 
best sources of free, attractive, and nutrient-rich mulch for flower beds, 
fruits, and vegetables. Be sure to shred leaves before using to prevent 
matting in the garden. I run over fallen leaves with the lawn mower, dis-
charging them into easy-to-rake mounds.
 
 Pine needles and the leaves of oak and some other trees acidify the 
soil. Use these freely around acid-loving plants, but monitor the soil pH 
around less tolerant plants. Some plants are sensitive to the chemicals 
in certain tree leaves. Cabbage-family plants, for example, don’t like oak 
leaves, and many plants, including tomatoes and blueberries, are incom-
patible with walnut leaves.

 Chapter 11: Weed It and Reap!
 
✓ Seed hulls and crop residue: These attractive, locally available, light-
weight materials include cocoa bean, buckwheat hulls, ground corncobs, 
and other substances left over from processing an agricultural crop. Use 
on top of newspaper or other sheet mulch to increase suppression of 
weeds. 
  
 If you decide to use cocoa mulch, take care: It can be toxic to dogs.
 
✓ Straw and hay: Although straw and hay are traditional mulches for 
vegetables and strawberries, beware! Hay contains weed seeds that can 
add to your problems. Straw from grain crops, such as oats and wheat, 
contains fewer seeds and is a better choice as weed-suppressing mulch. 
Allow the soil to warm up in the spring before putting mulch around 
tomatoes and other heat-loving crops; otherwise, the straw will insulate 
the soil from the sun’s warmth.
 
✓ Lawn clippings: Clippings cost nothing and work best in flower and veg-
etable gardens, where they decompose quickly. Allow the clippings to 
dry on the lawn before raking them up. Fresh clippings may mat down 
and become slimy as they decompose. If you’re getting clippings from a 
well-meaning friend, be sure that the clippings don’t come from a chemi-
cally treated lawn.
 
✓ Newspaper and cardboard: Use cardboard or several layers of whole 
newspaper sheets in pathways or around landscape plants to smother 
weeds. (Avoid using the colored glossy pages.) Cover with a thick layer 
of loose mulch, such as bark, shredded leaves, or straw. Depending on 
rainfall, you may have to replace newspaper during the growing season.
 
 If you have lots of ground to cover, ask your local newspaper printer 
whether you can have or buy the ends of paper rolls left over from print-
ing. It’s easy to roll out a section, moisten the paper with a hose, and 
apply mulch, and then continue unrolling the paper for the next section.
 
Some organic mulches can go sour if they get too wet and packed down, and 
begin to decompose without sufficient air. If your mulch smells like vinegar, 
ammonia, sulfur, or silage, mix and aerate it with a garden fork. Don’t apply 
sour mulch around flowers, vegetables, fruits, or young shrubs and trees; 
its acidity can damage or even kill the plants. Cover unused mulch piles with 
a tarp.
No matter what kind of organic mulch you use, keep it away from direct con-
tact with plant stems and trunks. Pull it several inches away from the plants 
to prevent moisture buildup around the trunks and to deter insects, slugs, 
rodents, and diseases. Be sure to loosen mulch with a rake periodically to 
allow water to penetrate easily.
Nondecomposing mulches
Some mulches don’t decompose but have other special uses that make them 
useful in some situations:

172
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Gravel and stone are best for landscapes in fire-prone areas and around 
buildings where termites and carpenter ants pose problems. They 
don’t add significant nutrients to the soil, however, and usually need 
landscape fabric (see the following paragraph) under them to prevent 
weeds. Avoid sand, which attracts cats, ants, and weed seeds.
 
✓ Landscape fabrics allow water to pass through but shade the ground 
and prevent weeds from coming up. They also prevent organic material 
from reaching the soil, however, and I find that shallow-rooted plants 
such as blueberries grow roots into the landscape fabric, making it dif-
ficult to remove later.
 
 Although the synthetic fabric lasts a long time, it may need to be 
replaced at some point. Use it around trees and shrubs or under decks 
where you don’t want weeds, but avoid using landscape fabrics in gar-
dens. There are new paper versions of landscape fabric that can be used 
anywhere.
 
✓ Plastic sheeting is commonly used to cover soil under heat-loving crops 
like tomatoes and squash. Black and colored plastics heat the soil; white 
plastic keeps it cool. Plants growing in plastic mulch need careful and 
frequent irrigation because rain won’t reach the soil. Don’t use plastic 
sheeting around landscape plants, because it prevents water and air 
from reaching roots.
 
 Many specialty plastic mulches are available now, in addition to the 
basic black and clear plastic that you find in the hardware store. Here 
are two examples:
 
• IRT (infrared transmitting) plastic lets in the warming rays of the 
sun but blocks the rays that stimulate seed growth.
 
• SRM (selective reflective mulches) warm the soil, increase some 
crop yields, and may repel some pests. But their unique benefit is 
that they reflect specific wavelengths of light back to the plants, 
stimulating growth.
 
 Some organic gardeners avoid plastic mulches despite their benefits 
because as they age they become brittle and break into pieces but never 
truly biodegrade.
 
✓ Mulch mats are made from a variety of materials, including cocoa fiber 
and recycled rubber. Most of these mats are designed to look like bark 
mulch but last much longer. Circular mats are designed to be placed 
around trees; the long strips are for edging beds.

173
 Chapter 11: Weed It and Reap!
Solarizing
One of the niftiest ways to beat the weeds is to solarize — use the heating 
power of the sun. The concept is simple: Capture the sun’s heat under a 
sheet of clear plastic and literally bake the weeds and their seeds to death. 
Use solarization to clear existing plants from new gardens. If the soil gets hot 
enough, solarization also eliminates some soil-dwelling pests and diseases.
This technique takes several weeks in warm, sunny climates. If you garden 
in a cool, cloudy climate, try it during the warmest or sunniest times of year, 
and allow up to 8 weeks for the process to work. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Mow closely or till the ground to remove as much of the existing 
vegetation as you can.
 
 Solarization works best on bare ground.
 
2. Dampen the soil.
 
 Moisture helps speed the process.
 
3. Spread a sheet of heavy-gauge clear plastic over the area.
 
 Stretch it taut to keep it close to the ground, as shown in Figure 11-1.
 
4. Anchor with stones.
 
 Place a few stones or other weights on the plastic to keep it from blowing 
around and to hold it near the soil.
 
5. Seal the edge of the plastic to hold in the heat by covering it all the 
way around with soil or boards.

Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
Avoid tilling the soil after solarization; otherwise, you may bring new seeds to 
the surface.
Cover cropping
Open ground is an open invitation for weed seeds to take root and for creep-
ing plants to expand their territory. You can prevent and smother weeds, 
protect the soil from erosion, and enrich the soil at the same time by planting 
crops that you can till into the soil later. Thickly planted cover crops prevent 
weed seeds from sprouting and crowd out the ones that do. When the cover 
crop has done its job, you simply rototill it into the soil, where it decomposes 
and adds organic matter. (Cover crops grown primarily to add nutrients are 
sometimes called green manures, which I discuss in Chapter 5.)
 
Unlike some other weed-control measures, cover cropping requires you to 
plan ahead.
Legumes, grasses, and buckwheat
Cover crops fall into two broad categories. Within each group, some crops 
live for a single season and others are perennial, coming back year after year:
 
✓ Legumes: Plants that can convert nitrogen from the air to nitrogen in 
the soil are called legumes. These plants increase the fertility of the soil 
while they grow and add rich organic matter when they’re rotary-tilled 
under. Some of them, especially alfalfa, have deep roots that bring water 
and other nutrients to the surface.
 
 Legumes provide an excellent source of nectar for bees as well as habi-
tat for numerous beneficial insects. Legumes for cover crops include 
several types of clover, hairy vetch, soybeans, and alfalfa.
 
✓ Grasses and buckwheat: These cover crops grow quickly, allowing 
you to till under some of them just a few weeks after planting; others 
can remain in place for months. Either way, they add large amounts of 
organic matter to the soil.
 
 Buckwheat flowers are valuable for bee nectar. Other cover crops in this 
group include annual ryegrass, oats, winter rye, and Sudangrass. 
Ways to use cover crops
Cover crops can serve your garden needs in different ways, depending on 
your goals and time frame:

175
 Chapter 11: Weed It and Reap!
 
✓ New garden preparation: The year before you intend to plant a vegeta-
ble, fruit, or flower garden, turn over the soil and sow a thick cover crop. 
Depending on the crop used and on whether you have time, turn under 
the first cover crop and grow another before tilling the garden for food 
or flowers.
 
✓ Between gardening seasons: After you harvest the last of your veg-
etables and remove the crop residue from the garden, sow a cover crop 
for the winter. If you live in a cold-winter climate, choose a fast-growing 
grass and plant it at least several weeks before the ground freezes. Turn 
it under in the spring. In warmer climates, prevent the cover crop from 
going to seed; otherwise, it can become a weed itself.
 
✓ During the garden season: Some cover crops, especially white clover, 
are useful as permanent ground covers in orchards and in the aisles 
between permanent planting beds. Clover encourages beneficial insects 
and adds nitrogen to the soil while preventing noxious weeds.
Farm supply stores usually are the least expensive sources of cover-crop 
seed. Their knowledgeable staff can help you choose the best crop for your 
climate and particular need. If you don’t have a farm supply store nearby or 
just need a small amount of seed, buy it from a seed catalog that specializes 
in organic supplies. Read more about cover crops in Chapter 5.
Flaming
Among the latest and most effective weed killers to hit the market are 
propane-fueled flamers, which make quick work of weeds. These devices 
don’t actually set plants on fire; they have special nozzles that work by 
literally boiling the sap inside the plants and bursting their cells.
The least expensive flamer costs little more than a high-quality rake and is 
a worthwhile investment for a large garden, yard, or orchard. Expect to pay 
$30 to more than $100 for a flamer hose, fittings, nozzle, and valves. The gear 
attaches to any standard propane tank, such as the kind used for barbecue 
grills. The most expensive models allow you to wear the fuel tank as a back-
pack and include convenient squeeze-control valves. You can purchase flam-
ers at farm and garden supply stores and from mail-order companies.
For the most effective control, use your flamer when weeds are small (see 
Figure 11-2). Large weeds and tough perennials may need repeat treatments.
 
Avoid using flamers in windy or dry conditions, especially if you live in an arid 
region. Keep a hose or other water source handy to douse unexpected flames.

Flamers use a nonrenewable resource, propane, to generate the heat. 
Gardeners striving for a sustainable landscape may want to limit the use of 
propane, which is a fossil fuel.
Pulling and cultivating
Good old-fashioned hand pulling and hoeing aren’t among gardeners’ favorite 
garden chores, but they work, especially if you follow these two basic rules:
 
✓ Disturb the soil as little as possible. This first rule is really important, 
because many weed seeds lie dormant in the darkness just under the 
soil surface. When you churn up the soil, you expose the seeds to the 
light and air they need to sprout and attain pest status.
 
✓ Get them while they’re small. Small weeds with fragile roots and stems 
take little effort to destroy. Large weeds take more work, disrupt more 
soil, and potentially contribute to the seed population in your soil if you 
leave them long enough to go to seed. Also, the longer the weeds live, 
the more water and nutrients they rob from your food and landscape 
plants.
Weeding techniques
If you’ll be pulling by hand, moisten the soil thoroughly first, preferably the 
day before so that the soil can drain. The weeds will be much easier to pull 
and you’re more likely to get the whole root than you would in dry soil. You 
can leave small pulled weed seedlings in the garden to decompose; remove 
larger ones to the compost pile.
Weed your garden in sections. When you complete a section, immediately 
cover the soil with a layer of organic mulch to prevent more weeds from 

177
 Chapter 11: Weed It and Reap!
invading. Any weeds that do manage to grow through the mulch will be 
easier to pull. To keep lawn grass from invading perennial beds, install edging 
that extends several inches into the soil.
Weeding tools
With so many different weeding devices on the market, you may have a dif-
ficult time choosing the most effective tools for the job. The kinds of weeds 
that you’re dealing with affect your choice. For plants with long taproots 
(dandelions and burdock, for example), you need a tool that reaches down 
into the soil and pulls out the entire root without disturbing your lawn too 
much. I use a dandelion weeder, also called an asparagus knife or fishtail 
weeder, which consists of a 12-inch-long metal rod with a forked tip and 
wooden handle.
Most weeds don’t require such a specialized tool, however. The most effec-
tive and all-around useful weeding tools disturb very little soil as they work. 
The best hoes for weeding, shown in Figure 11-3, have sharp blades that slice 
the plants just below the soil surface:
 
✓ Collinear hoe: The collinear hoe allows you to stand up straight as you 
weed.
 
✓ Stirrup hoe: I use the stirrup hoe frequently because it cuts on both the 
push and pull actions.
 
✓ Swan-neck hoe: The swan-neck hoe gets into tight spots easily.

Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Smaller hand tools and those with shorter handles are available too; they 
allow you to weed raised beds or weed while sitting or kneeling.
 
All weeding hoes need occasional touching up with a sharpening stone.
Organic herbicides
When all else fails, gardeners can turn to herbicides to kill the weeds. 
Before you accuse me of blasphemy, allow me to introduce you to some 
organic weed-control chemicals. As with any chemical treatment — organic 
or synthetic — use the most powerful ones only as a last resort.
Herbicides work in several ways that depend on a particular plant’s life stage 
or characteristics to be effective:
 
✓ Pre-emergent herbicide: Sprouting seeds send out roots first, followed 
by the stem and first leaves. This vulnerable time is the best and easiest 
stage in which to knock them out. Pre-emergent herbicides kill these tiny 
seedlings as they sprout and are especially useful on lawns and in other 
places where mature weeds are difficult to remove.
 
 One relatively new organic pre-emergent herbicide is corn gluten meal, 
a highly concentrated corn protein extract. It can control weeds for up 
to six weeks if applied in early spring and again in late summer, and as a 
bonus, it’s high in nitrogen.
 
✓ Herbicidal soap: Plants have a waxy coating on their leaves that pre-
vents moisture loss. Herbicidal soap damages the waxy layer, allowing 
the plant to dry out and die. This type of herbicide works best on young, 
tender, actively growing weeds in hot, dry weather. It’s less effective on 
mature plants and perennial weeds.
Plants are sensitive to changes in pH. Some products use acetic acid (derived 
from vinegar) or pelargonic acid (derived from fruit) as their active ingre-
dient. These acids damage the plants’ protective waxy coating, killing the 
sprayed plant parts in a matter of hours. 
 
Regular kitchen vinegar is only 5 percent acetic acid; though it may kill weed 
seedlings, it has little effect on mature plants. Commercial formulations of up 
to 20 percent acetic acid are available. Although these substances are more 
potent weed-killers, they’re also more hazardous to use. Follow label direc-
tions, wear gloves and goggles when applying, and store them as you would 
any other garden chemicals.

179
 Chapter 11: Weed It and Reap!
These products are acceptable for spot treatments but shouldn’t be used 
extensively, because they also kill beneficial organisms and lower soil pH. 
New formulations made from a combination of vinegar and citrus, cinnamon, 
and/or clove oils have been introduced recently.
Home Sweet Home
As if weeds themselves weren’t bad enough, they also contribute to the two 
other major headaches that gardeners face: pests and diseases. Knowing 
which insects and diseases the wild plants around your garden harbor can 
help you decide whether to encourage their growth or eradicate them.
For insects, both good and bad
Wild plants provide habitat for a wide range of insects, but not all bugs are 
bad bugs. Some insects (such as the beneficial insects discussed in Chapter 7) 
actually help your garden, and many of them depend on wild plants for 
habitat — places to lay their eggs, forage for food, and spend the winter 
months.
Wild plants with small flowers — yarrow, goldenrod, pigweed, and wild 
carrots — attract many beneficial insects. In addition, wasps that prey on 
aphids, caterpillars, and other pests also enjoy pollen and nectar-rich flowers, 
such as dandelions, daisies, clover, nettles, and coneflowers. Leave these 
plants in the wild places outside your garden, but remove their spent flowers 
before they go to seed and spread beyond their allotted space.
Some wild plants not only provide habitat for beneficial bugs, but also create 
a haven for damaging insects. Carrot rust flies live on both wild and garden-
variety carrots, for example, and wild apple trees harbor curculio, apple 
maggots, and codling moths that move into your nearby orchard. Consider 
eliminating these wild plants near your garden if you have trouble with the 
pests they perpetuate.
Another way that some wild plants benefit your garden is by attracting pests 
that would otherwise discover and damage your crops. I’m perfectly happy 
to encourage the wild grapes and other so-called trap plants that Japanese 
beetles like to munch if they leave my roses alone! In some cases, you may 
wait to until these wild weeds have attracted a load of pests and then destroy 

180
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
them, taking care of two problems at the same time. Flowering mustard, for 
example, attracts cabbage worms and harlequin bugs. When the wild plants 
contain plenty of pests, pull them up and destroy them — killing two birds 
with one stone, so to speak.
For diseases that spread to related plants
Wild plants often suffer the same diseases that affect cultivated plants and 
gladly spread their misery around. Related plants such as those in the night-
shade family — including deadly nightshade, horsenettle, potatoes, toma-
toes, and eggplants — can infect one another with verticillium wilt and other 
diseases. Wild brambles share viruses with strawberries and cultivated bram-
bles. Insects that feed on these plants often spread diseases as they travel 
and forage, and the soil remains contaminated even after the diseased weeds 
are gone. Avoid planting vulnerable plants in the same soil where related spe-
cies grew within the past few years, and control insects that spread diseases.
See Chapter 9 for more on diseases and Chapter 8 for insect identification 
and control.

W
hether you’re planting vegetables, fruits, herbs, or trees and shrubs, it’s 
important to know a little something about each plant, such as when 
to plant it and how it grows. This chapter gives you an overview of the various 
types of plants and describes planting techniques. Look to Chapters 13–20 for 
more specific information on different types of garden and landscape plants.
Types of Plants
Garden and landscape plants can be divided into categories — annuals, bienni-
als, and perennials (both herbaceous and woody) — based on their life cycles. 
I describe all four types of plants in the following sections. (Refer to Chapter 3 
for more information about plant types, hardiness, and climate zones.)
Annual plants
Annual plants complete their life cycles in one growing season and must 
be replanted each spring. Most vegetables and some flowers and herbs 
are annuals. You plant annual crops in spring, and harvest in summer and 
autumn; then the plants die. The following spring, you start over. Tomatoes, 
peppers, corn, and melons fall into this category. So do herbs like dill and 
basil, and flowers like sunflowers and zinnias.
You can purchase annuals as young plants growing in containers — sometimes 
called transplants or starter plants — or start them yourself from seed. Some 
plants are easier to start from seed than others; see “Starting from Seed,” later 
in this chapter.

184
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Biennial plants
Biennial plants complete their life cycles in two years. Because they flower in 
their second year, by planting biennials every year you’ll always have some 
in bloom. Biennials, such as parsley, that are grown for their leaves are often 
grown as annuals and replanted each spring (see the preceding section).
 
If you purchase or sow biennial flowers, make sure the plants are hardy 
in your area because they’ll need to overwinter, then bloom in the second 
growing season.
Herbaceous perennials
Herbaceous perennials are plants that live for more than two years. Each 
autumn the aboveground parts die back. If a perennial is hardy in your 
region, the roots remain alive and resprout the following spring. Many flow-
ers and herbs are herbaceous perennials, as are a few familiar vegetables 
and fruits, such as asparagus, horseradish, and strawberries. Perennial 
herbs include thyme, oregano, and sage. The thousands of perennial flowers 
include coneflower, black-eyed Susan, and peony.
Perennial plants are sometimes started from seed but are more commonly 
sold growing in containers or as bare-root plants. Bare-root plants are 
sold during their dormant season and are packaged without soil around 
their roots. Instead, the roots are packed in moist newspaper or sawdust. 
Asparagus and strawberries are commonly sold in bare-root condition.
Woody perennials
Woody perennials are plants whose aboveground parts persist throughout 
the winter and are more commonly called trees and shrubs. Most landscapes 
include trees and shrubs, most of which are grown for their ornamental prop-
erties. Landscape designers sometimes describe these woody plants as form-
ing the bones of the landscape. They provide a year-round framework and 
backdrop for other garden plants.
Woody plants are sold growing in containers, bare root, or balled and bur-
lapped. Balled and burlapped plants are dug from the field with a ball of soil 
around their roots; then this ball of soil is wrapped in burlap or plastic.

185
 Chapter 12: Planting How-To
Starting from Seed
You can start many plants from seed, but annual flowers and vegetables are the 
most common types. Starting your own plants from seed has many benefits:
 
✓ Seeds usually come in greater variety than plants. A store may offer 
a half-dozen varieties of tomato plants, for example, but hundreds of 
tomato varieties are available by seed. The same is true of many flowers.
 
✓ You control what’s sprayed on plants. Growers and garden centers may 
use nonorganic pesticides; if you start from seed, you can manage pests 
organically.
 
✓ You can provide plants the optimum conditions to thrive. Purchased 
plants are often grown in hot, humid greenhouses and given a daily dose 
of synthetic fertilizer to promote fast growth. By the time they reach store 
shelves, they’re often root-bound, with the roots completely filling the 
pot. In the garden, these plants may struggle to adapt to the harsher con-
ditions, and their small root systems are so used to synthetic nutrients 
that they may not be able to take up nutrients from the soil efficiently.
 
✓ Some plants grow best from seed. Although you can purchase squash 
and nasturtium as starter plants, for example, these varieties grow so 
quickly from seed that seed-grown plants often outperform transplanted 
ones that need time to acclimate after planting.
 
✓ It’s fun! Perhaps this is the best reason.
You have two ways to grow plants from seed: direct sowing and starting 
plants in containers. I discuss both methods in the following sections.
Why bare root?
If properly stored and shipped, bare-root plants 
grow as well as, or better than, container-
grown plants. Bare-root plants are often less 
expensive, and you may find a greater selec-
tion of varieties than in container-grown plants, 
especially from mail-order companies.
These plants must be kept cool so that they 
don’t break dormancy until they’re planted. If 
you purchase plants through the mail, be sure 
to keep them cool upon arrival and plant them 
within a day or two.
Avoid buying bare-root plants that have been 
sitting on store shelves and have begun to 
sprout. They are no longer dormant and will 
struggle to get established in your garden.

186
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Sowing seeds directly
Some plants grow best when their seed is sown directly into the garden. In 
some cases, the plants grow so quickly that direct sowing is the most effi-
cient method. In other cases, the seedlings’ roots are so sensitive that they 
don’t like to be disturbed.
Sorting out seed types
When choosing varieties of seeds to plant, you 
may come across the terms open pollinated, 
heirloom, hybrid, and genetically modified. The 
first three types are important for home gar-
deners; the fourth is a new type that, to date, 
applies mainly to commercial farmers.
 ✓ Open-pollinated varieties produce offspring 
that are similar to the parents. The flowers 
are pollinated naturally rather than in a 
plant-breeding lab. Some genetic variability
occurs among the plants, so when growers
save seed from their best-performing 
plants, those traits are passed to the off-
spring. Many open-pollinated varieties are 
locally adapted and have unusual colors, 
shapes, and flavors. Gardeners have relied 
on these varieties for generations because 
they can save the seeds for replanting.
 ✓ Heirloom seeds are varieties that have 
been planted for several generations — 
perhaps 50 years or more, although there’s 
no specific longevity required to qualify as 
an heirloom.
 ✓ Hybrid varieties have been around since 
the 1920s. Researchers found that breeding 
different corn varieties together resulted 
in offspring with better traits than either 
parent, and they grew more vigorously and 
uniformly. Many hybrid varieties exhibit 
improved disease resistance. Hybrid seeds 
are a result of controlled cross-pollination 
of specific parent plants. For this reason, 
plants grown from seed collected from 
hybrid plants may not resemble the parent 
plant closely. If you plant seeds from a 
hybrid tomato, for example, you’ll get a 
tomato plant, but its fruit may not taste 
nearly as good as does the parent plant’s.
 ✓ Genetically modified plants (sometimes 
called genetically modified organisms, or 
GMOs) are created through gene splicing, 
wherein genetic material from unrelated 
plants or even other organisms is inserted 
into a plant. These varieties generally are 
available only to commercial farmers. 
Genetically modified plants may offer some 
benefits, but many questions still exist 
about the long-term health risks and envi-
ronmental safety of manipulating the gene 
pool so dramatically and quickly. GMOs are 
not allowed in organic growing. Read more 
about GMOs in Chapter 2.
Which type of seeds to plant is a personal 
decision, and your decision doesn’t have to 
be all or nothing. Many organic growers plant 
hybrids; others opt for open-pollinated varieties
so that they can save seeds for replanting. 
If you know that tomatoes commonly suffer 
from Fusarium in your area, for example, go 
ahead and plant some flavorful but susceptible 
heirloom Brandywine tomatoes — but include 
a few Fusarium-resistant hybrid plants too, just 
in case the disease is especially bad this year 
and your Brandywines succumb. The key is 
to experiment in your garden with a range of 
varieties to find the ones that grow, produce, 
and taste best.

187
 Chapter 12: Planting How-To
Corn, beans, peas, carrots, sunflowers, larkspur, and morning glories all grow 
best when their seeds are planted directly in the garden.
Preparing the soil
Well-prepared soil is the key to successful growing, especially with seeds 
that you sow directly in the garden. Remove golf-ball-size or larger rocks 
and clods of soil; rake the bed flat. For more about preparing your soil, see 
Chapter 5.
Sowing the seeds
 
Whether you’re planting flower or vegetable seeds, the general rule is to 
plant seeds twice as deep as the seeds are wide. For big seeds, such as beans, 
that means about 1 to 2 inches deep; small seeds, such as lettuce, should be 
planted only 
1⁄4-inch deep. Heed the planting depth guidelines on seed packets, 
because seeds planted too deeply may not grow.
Seed packets also provide specific planting information. Some seeds require 
light to germinate, for example, and should be pressed into the soil surface 
rather than buried.
Label the beds, noting the plant type, planting date, and days to germination 
(also listed on the seed packet).
Tending the soil and the sprouts
After planting, keep the soil evenly moist, especially the soil surface. If the 
surface dries out, it can form a crust that prevents seedlings from emerging. 
In hot weather, a daily light sprinkling may be necessary.
You should see signs of life within a few days for quick sprouters or in two 
weeks or more for slow growers. Be patient — as long as you used fresh seed 
labeled for the current year, the plants should come up. In unusually wet and 
cold or hot and dry soil, however, seeds may rot or fail to sprout. Keep track 
of the days to germination, and if that period passes with no signs of sprout-
ing, replant when the weather improves.
Starting seeds indoors
In many parts of the country, the growing season is too short to grow slow-
maturing plants from seed sown in the garden. Tomatoes, peppers, petunias, 
and pansies are examples of plants that must be started indoors or in a 
heated greenhouse. By the time the weather warms up, the plants will be 
several inches tall and will have a good head start.
 
In regions with long winters, starting seeds indoors is a great way to beat the 
winter blues as well as to get a jump on the gardening season.

What you need
To start seeds indoors successfully, you need some specific equipment:
 
✓ Sterile soilless seed-starting mix: Purchased planting mix has the 
proper balance of drainage and water-holding capacity, and it’s sterile 
to minimize disease problems. Avoid using garden soil to start seeds 
indoors; it often drains poorly and may harbor organisms that can 
damage germinating seeds. Note: Some seed-starting mixes contain syn-
thetic fertilizers, so choose carefully.
  
✓ Containers: Any small vessel with drainage holes will suffice, but most 
gardeners use purchased plastic flats or peat pots set into a waterproof 
tray.
 
✓ Light source: Although some seeds can be started on a sunny window-
sill, you’ll have better success if you provide supplemental light. You 
can purchase commercial indoor light gardens or rig up a set of fluores-
cent lights over a table. Raise the lights (or lower the table) so that the 
lights remain close to, but not touching, the growing plants.
Planting your seeds
Before you begin, moisten the seed-starting mix with warm water. Then fill 
each container with mix, firming it gently. Sow seeds at the depth recom-
mended on the seed packet. Label containers with the type of seed, the 
planting date, and the days to germination; then set the containers in a warm 
place. Check the containers daily, and as soon as you see the first sprout, 
place the containers under lights.
Caring for the emerging plants
To care for your growing plants, follow this advice:
 
✓ Watering: Plants growing in small containers may need watering daily. 
Strive to keep the soil evenly moist — think wrung-out sponge. Too 
much moisture can lead to root rot; too little moisture will wilt the 
plants.
  
✓ Fertilizing: Begin fertilizing your seedlings when they have two sets of 
true leaves (the first set of leaves is called seed leaves). One option is to 
use an organic fertilizer diluted to half strength once a week. Some gar-
deners use 
1⁄4-strength fertilizer at every watering.
 
✓ Transplanting: Depending on the type of plant, the size of the container, 
and the length of time until you set the plants out in the garden, you may 
need to transplant seedlings into larger containers. Do the transplanting 
when the roots are starting to fill out the container but before they begin 
to wrap around the perimeter and grow out the drainage holes.
When should you start different kinds of seeds? Create a planting calendar, 
as described in Chapter 13.

189
 Chapter 12: Planting How-To
 
Keep seed packets so that you can refer to them during the season for infor-
mation such as spacing guidelines. Also, if a crop performs especially well or a 
flower is particularly beautiful, having the packet allows you to track the 
source of the seeds.
Buying Plants
Few gardeners grow all their plants from seed; most of us buy some plants. 
These days, it seems as though everyone sells plants, from the traditional 
greenhouse/nursery to the drugstore. You can also order plants from a cata-
log or on the Internet. Wherever you purchase them, it pays to buy the best-
quality plants that you can find.
Knowing your sources
Here are some pros and cons of different sources:
 
✓ Locally owned garden centers: They usually offer the best varieties for 
your area and can give you advice on growing them. Plants grown on-site 
haven’t been subjected to shipping stress. Usually, the size-to-price ratio 
is excellent. Although the selection may not be as large as a mail-order 
catalog offers, I often find a good blend of favorite “bread-and-butter” 
varieties and newer, more exotic offerings.
 
✓ National chain stores: Garden centers attached to home improvement 
and mass-market department stores are known for their cheap prices 
and vast quantities of merchandise, but watch out for neglected plants. 
For the best-quality plants, show up when the delivery trucks do. Be 
sure that the perennials, trees, and shrubs you buy are truly hardy in 
your climate. The staff may or may not have a clue.
 
✓ Mail-order catalogs and Web sites: The glossy pictures look perfect 
and enticing, and the descriptions sound like dreams come true. Due 
to shipping costs, however, the plants usually are smaller and more 
expensive than locally grown specimens. The plants also have to 
undergo the rigors of hot or cold and bumpy travel. Catalogs, however, 
expand the universe of available plant varieties and offer a cornucopia 
for the specialist and the connoisseur.
 
Buying your plants from any specific source matters less than choosing vig-
orous, healthy specimens. When you buy your plants by mail, you’re at the 
mercy of the supplier, so when you find a reliable source, you may want to 
stick with it rather than simply look around for the best deal.

190
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Picking winners
When you’re shopping for plants locally, it helps to know what qualities to 
look for. Here’s how I pick the winners from the losers:
 
✓ Look for disease-free foliage. Avoid plants with yellow, brown, or black 
spots or with wilted, yellow, or mottled leaves. See Chapter 9 for more 
on diseases.
 
✓ Check for pests. Pass your hand gently over a flat of seedlings. If a cloud 
of whiteflies or tiny gnats swirls up out of the foliage, pass the plants by. 
Peek under leaves for aphids, thrips, and spider mites, and check stems 
for scale insects. See Chapter 8 for pest descriptions.
 
✓ Watch for mechanical damage. Look for broken stems or bruised 
leaves, which can indicate rough handling.
 
✓ Choose plants whose compact growth is in proportion to pot size. If 
the top of the plant appears to be too big for the pot, the roots may be 
squished and/or the plant has been pushed into vigorous growth with 
lots of fertilizer. Both conditions compromise the plant’s health and abil-
ity to adapt to life in the garden.
 
✓ Small is beautiful. Large plants make a more immediate impact in your 
garden, but they cost more and recover from transplanting more slowly 
than smaller ones do. Small perennials and annuals often catch up in 
growth to larger plants within a few weeks and may even surpass them 
by season’s end. And although they’re tempting, avoid flowers that are 
already in full bloom. Instead, look for compact plants with healthy foliage.
 
It goes without saying that buying wilted plants is a no-no. Plants need water 
to survive, and even a short drought when they are small and growing rapidly 
can affect how they perform in your garden in the coming months. If you see 
widespread wilting in the nursery, take your business elsewhere.
 
When you transport your plants from the store to your planting site, protect 
them from wind, heat, and cold. Never carry them uncovered in the back of a 
truck — conditions in the bed of a moving truck are the equivalent of a hur-
ricane — and don’t leave them to cook in a closed vehicle. When you get them 
home, keep them in a cool, shady place, and water as needed until planting 
time.
Preparation and Planting
After you get your plants home from the nursery (or, if you planted them 
from seed, when you decide that they’ve grown enough), you can pop them 
right in the ground, right? Not so fast. Plants have a better chance of survival 
if you follow this advice first:

191
 Chapter 12: Planting How-To
 
✓ Check the calendar and the weather forecast. Be sure that the tempera-
tures are warm enough for the type of plant. If there’s a threat of temper-
atures dropping into the 40s, heat-loving plants are going to be shocked 
and unhappy about their plight.
 
✓ Prepare plants for outdoor life. If you’re planting indoor- or green-
house-grown plants, you need to give them time to toughen up gradu-
ally so they can adjust to the natural wind and sun conditions in your 
garden. Introduce them to the great outdoors on cloudy, calm days, and 
bring them inside at night. Gradually allow them more direct sun and 
wind over a period of seven to ten days. Allow the soil to dry between 
waterings, but don’t let the plants wilt. This process is called hardening 
off. When the plants can tolerate full sun and wind, they’re ready for the 
garden. (Be sure to cover tender plants if frost threatens.)
 
✓ Time your planting to coincide with seasonably cool and damp 
weather. Transplanting invariably damages some roots, so plants may 
not be able to take up water fast enough to endure hot, sunny weather. If 
you must plant when it’s hot, provide some shade and keep plants well 
watered until they can survive on their own.
 
✓ Prepare the soil. The perfect garden soil is weed free, well drained, 
loosened, and fertile. See Chapter 5 for more on soil.
When the weather is cooperative, the ground is ready, and your plants are 
hardened off, you’re ready to go. The following sections tell you what to do.
Planting container-grown perennials, 
annuals, and vegetables
Whether your plants are purchased or homegrown, the act of putting plants 
in the ground is pretty straightforward, and most plants are quite forgiving. 
Water the plants a few hours before planting and then follow these simple 
steps to get your potted plants off to a good start:
 
1. Dig a hole that’s twice as wide as the pot.
 
 Use a shovel or trowel, and make the hole deep enough to keep the plant 
at the same soil level that it occupied in its container.
 
2. Gently remove the plant from the pot.
 
 Cup your hand around the stem of the plant and tip the pot gently, sup-
porting the soil with your fingers and the heel of your hand, and protect-
ing the stem and leaves from bruising. Push or tap on the bottom of the 
pot if the plant resists, but don’t pull on the stem.
 
 If the plant is large, lay the container on its side on the ground, and slide 
the plant out. Squeeze or roll the pot if necessary to dislodge the root 
ball; if you can’t loosen it, cut the pot away.

192
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
3. Put the plant into the hole.
 
 In most cases, the crown of the plant — where the roots meet the top 
of the plant; usually the soil level in the pot — should be at or slightly 
above ground level. Add soil to or remove soil from the hole so the plant 
sits at the proper height.
 
4. Backfill with soil.
 
 Gently fill around the roots, firming the soil around the roots while keep-
ing the crown at the proper level.
 
5. Water the plant.
 
 Saturate the soil gently, being careful not to displace the soil. Add more 
soil to the hole if needed.
 
 If water appears to be running off rather than soaking in, create a berm 
of soil in a circle around the plant to create a shallow basin (see Figure 
12-1). Fill the basin with water, and allow it to soak in. To prevent stem 
rot, remove the berm during prolonged wet weather and after the plant 
is established.
 
Figure 12-1: 
Make a 
raised ring 
or berm of 
soil around 
the planting 
hole, and fill 
with water.
 
Planting bare-root plants
Plant bare-root plants as soon as possible after purchasing or receiving them 
through the mail. Immediately unwrap the plants from the packaging, and 
make sure that the packing material — usually sawdust or shredded paper — 
is moist. If you must delay planting for a few days, keep the plants moist and 
in a cool, dark location.

193
 Chapter 12: Planting How-To
 
Don’t store bare-root plants with any ripening fruit, such as in a refrigerator or 
root cellar, because the fruit gives off ethylene, which harms growing plants.
Here’s how to get your bare-root plants off to a good start:
 
1. Prune any damaged or dead roots and stems, and prune back extra-
long roots so that they’re even with the others.
 
2. Soak the root system.
 
 Place the roots in a bucket of tepid water for about an hour before planting.
 
3. Dig a planting hole that’s twice as wide as your plant’s root spread.
 
 Follow the instructions that come with the plant to determine how deep 
to dig the hole. In many cases, the plant’s crown should sit at the soil 
level, but the level varies depending on the type of plant.
 
4. Make a mound of soil in the bottom of the hole and then set the plant 
on top of this mound, spreading the roots evenly around it.
 
5. Fill the planting hole half way and then add water to settle and 
moisten the soil around the roots.
 
6. Finish backfilling and then water the plant thoroughly.
 
 If necessary, create a berm of soil in a circle around the plant to keep 
water from running off (refer to Figure 12-1).
Planting trees and shrubs
Trees and shrubs are often expensive, and it pays to take special care in 
planting them. Most woody plants are sold in containers or are balled and 
burlapped (refer to “Woody perennials,” earlier in this chapter). Be sure 
that the soil is moist, but not sopping wet, at planting time to make handling 
easier. Prune any damaged, dead, or broken stems before planting.
In some circles, the proper way to dig a hole is controversial. What’s the big 
deal, you ask? Plenty, if you ask someone who installs trees for a living. If you 
plant trees and shrubs too deep or too high, or crowd the roots into a small 
hole, they’ll fail to thrive. People who study these things have also discov-
ered that adding peat moss and other amendments to the planting hole is not 
only unnecessary but also can contribute to trouble in the long run: Roots 
tend to stay where the soil is most fertile and may not venture outside the 
walls of the original hole. The resulting plants have small root systems, are 
more prone to drought stress, and are likely to blow over in a strong wind.
Here’s the right way to plant a tree or shrub:

194
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
1. Measure the diameter of the root ball or root spread, and multiply the 
result by 3 to find the diameter of the hole you need to dig.
 
 If the root ball is 1 foot wide, for example, you need a 3-foot-wide hole.
 
2. Measure the depth of the root ball and dig a hole no bigger than this 
result.
 
 The idea is to set the root ball on undisturbed soil. If it’s sitting on loos-
ened or amended soil, the tree or shrub may sink over time.
 
3. Check the planting depth.
 
 Test the depth by setting the tree in the hole. The trunk flare — where 
the trunk widens near the base — should be at the soil surface or 
slightly above it, as shown in Figure 12-2. Shrubs should be at or slightly 
above the soil depth at which they previously grew.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Position the 
tree so that 
the trunk 
flare is at 
the soil 
surface.
 
 
4. Prepare the roots.
 
 Lift the plant out of the hole and slip it out of its pot or remove the plas-
tic burlap from the root ball. (You can leave natural burlap on the root 
ball because burlap degrades in the soil, but you should slice it off care-
fully and roll it down to help the decay process.) Prune broken roots 
and gently unwind tangled roots, preserving as many roots as possible.

195
 Chapter 12: Planting How-To
 
5. Put the plant back in the hole.
 
6. Backfill the hole until it is about three quarters full.
 
 Fill the hole with the soil you removed from the hole, working it gently 
around the roots and holding the tree in position. 
 
7. Add water.
 
 Fill the hole with water to settle the soil around the roots. Allow it to 
drain.
 
8. Finish filling the hole with soil.
 
9. Make a watering basin.
 
 Build a low ring of soil around the perimeter of the planting hole to hold 
water for the first few months (refer to Figure 12-1). Knock it down when 
the tree begins growing actively.
 
10. Mulch and water again.
 
 Spread a 2-inch-thick layer of bark or shredded leaf mulch over the 
planting area. Pull mulch 3 to 4 inches away from the trunk, however. 
Then water the tree again.
After planting your tree or shrub, water it only when the soil dries out to a 
depth of 4 to 6 inches. When you do add water, apply it slowly and gently, 
making sure that it soaks in rather than runs off. Moisten the soil down to the 
depth of the root ball.
What’s at stake?
Unless your tree has a trunk greater than 3 
inches in diameter or you live in a windy area, 
you probably don’t need to stake it. Trees 
develop stronger roots and trunks if they’re 
allowed to move in the wind. If you must stake 
a tree, follow these steps:
 1. Place two stakes opposite each other and 
perpendicular to the prevailing wind.
 2. Cut the stakes equal to half the height of the 
tree plus 18 inches.
 3. Loosely attach loops made from strips of 
soft cloth to the tree and stakes so that the 
tree can gently sway in the wind.
 4. Remove the stakes and ties after a year.

In This Chapter
▶ Making plans for your vegetable garden
▶ Sowing and caring for vegetable plants
▶ Reviewing all varieties of vegetables, from asparagus to zucchini
F
or most people, growing chemical-free vegetables is what organic gar-
dening is all about. As more and more news comes out about the dan-
gers of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, more people are choosing to grow 
their own food — and are finding that homegrown vegetables are fresher and 
taste better than the store-bought kind.
In the first half of this chapter, I talk about designing and starting your veg-
etable garden, and give you some tips to make your garden more productive. 
The second half of the chapter describes the most popular home-garden veg-
etables and varieties, tells you how to grow and harvest them, and describes 
which pests you can expect to show up for dinner.
Planning Your Vegetable Garden
You may dream of a big garden filled with all types of fresh and inviting veg-
etables, but getting to that stage takes experience and preparation. For the 
first-timer, small is beautiful; take time to get it right on a small scale before 
launching a market-garden-size project. Keep the following ideas in mind to 
save yourself a lot of work and frustration later in the season:
 
✓ Start small. Little plants and seeds turn into a big commitment as they 
grow. A 10-x-20-foot garden is plenty to grow a variety of vegetables, 
such as lettuce, beans, carrots, tomatoes, and peppers. If you want to 
grow vining crops or space hogs such as corn or pumpkins, you can 
expand it to 20 x 30 feet. Planting too large a space to keep well tended 
probably is the number-one cause of gardener frustration and burnout.

198
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Make it convenient and inviting. Place the garden in a location where 
you’ll see it daily. Mine is right outside the dining-room window, and my 
garden gets more attention now than it did when it was in the corner 
of our backyard. Your garden is more likely to thrive when you visit it 
regularly.
 
✓ Put the garden in full sun. Vegetable plants need at least six hours of 
full sun each day. Orient and plan the garden so that tall plants such as 
corn and tomatoes don’t cast shade on shorter plants such as beets and 
cabbage.
 
✓ Choose a well-drained spot. Vegetables are more prone to disease in 
soggy soil. Consider building raised beds. See Chapter 5 for how to test 
and amend soil for proper drainage.
 
✓ Grow a mix of crops. Planting a variety of vegetables ensures that some-
thing will produce. Also, diversity in the garden encourages good insects 
and helps reduce problems from harmful ones.
Choosing varieties
For some vegetables, dozens — or even hundreds — of varieties are avail-
able. How do you choose? Try these tips:
 
✓ Consider taste. Some varieties are relatively mild; others are more 
strongly flavored. Romano beans, for example, are described as having 
a pronounced beany flavor, and purple asparagus varieties are sweeter 
than green varieties.
 
✓ Look for disease resistance. The letters VFFNT in Celebrity tomato 
descriptions, for example, denote resistance to verticillium wilt, two 
strains of fusarium wilt, nematodes, and tobacco mosaic virus. Look for 
scab-resistant potatoes, powdery mildew–resistant squash, and downy 
mildew–resistant lettuce, too.
 
✓ Note days to maturity. If you live where summers are short or plan to 
grow a succession of crops, look for relatively fast-maturing varieties.
 
✓ Grow the unusual. Consider planting unusual crops or varieties — 
those that aren’t readily available in markets. Regular white potatoes are 
easy to find and inexpensive, but fingerling and blue potatoes are harder 
to find, and when you do find them they’re often expensive.
 
✓ Consider plant size. Look for varieties described as compact if space is 
at a premium.

199
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
Deciding what goes where
You can be as creative or traditional as you like in your vegetable-garden 
design. Plant everything in straight rows or create imaginative curved raised 
beds. My vegetable garden is oddly shaped, so I frequently make rounded 
and triangular beds. I even made a heart-shaped raised bed one year and 
planted it with red-leaf lettuce and carrots!
Draw your garden plan on graph paper, laying out rows and raised beds with 
a ruler and pencil. To figure out how many plants will fit into a row or bed, 
follow the guidelines on the seed packets and make little dots or circles to 
indicate the larger veggies, such as broccoli, tomatoes, and squash.
 
When you plan your vegetable garden, leave room for walking paths at least 24 
inches wide that allow you to harvest and work the beds easily. And don’t be 
afraid to mix in herbs and flowers. The more color and variety a garden has, 
the more beautiful it is, and the more likely it is to strike an ecological balance 
with birds and beneficial insects that help keep harmful pests in check.
 
For even more garden success, try a few of the techniques I use in my garden. 
They may help you grow better and more vegetables, too:
 
✓ Spread the wealth. Don’t plant all the same type of vegetables in one 
spot. I plant two small patches of beans in different places in the garden, 
for example, so that even if animals or insects destroy one patch, they 
may not find the other.
 
✓ Rotate crops every planting season, if possible. Follow crops that use 
lots of nitrogen, such as sweet corn and tomatoes, with crops that add 
nitrogen to the soil, such as beans and peas. Avoid planting crops from 
the same family, which tend to have the same insect pests and diseases, 
in the same spot — for example, tomatoes, eggplants, and potatoes or 
cabbage, broccoli, and kale. Allow at least three years before planting a 
vegetable family in the same spot again.
 
✓ Use succession planting. Some crops, such as lettuce and beans, are 
quick to mature, so you can plant them several times throughout the 
growing season for a constant supply of tender new vegetables. This 
technique works best when you plant small patches of each vegetable 
every two weeks. That way, you won’t ever have a glut of lettuce, and 
you can extend the growing season.

200
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Determining a planting date
Most vegetables are annual plants that die after one season of growth. They 
generally fall into two groups:
 
✓ Warm-season vegetables — such as tomatoes, peppers, sweet corn, 
melons, and cucumber — grow best in hot weather. Plant them one to 
two weeks after the last frost date for your area or when the soil is at 
least 60 degrees Fahrenheit. These plants don’t like the cold, so don’t 
rush to plant them before the soil warms up. Contact your local weather 
service, your cooperative extension office, or a gardening neighbor to 
determine your average last spring frost date, if you aren’t sure when it 
usually occurs.
 
✓ Cool-season vegetables — including broccoli, spinach, lettuce, car-
rots, and potatoes — grow best during cool weather. You usually can 
plant them in the garden one to two weeks before the last frost date. 
These crops not only tolerate cool weather, but also need it to grow and 
mature properly. You can even plant some cool-season crops, such as 
peas and lettuce, in midsummer to late summer for a fall harvest.
Winter is the quiet time between gardening seasons in most parts of the 
country. But in mild-winter and hot-summer areas of the country — such as 
Southern California, Texas, and Florida — you plant warm-season crops in 
spring and late summer, and cool-season crops in winter. Summer is the time 
for you and the veggies to take a break from the hot weather. In rainy, mild 
areas, you can grow some crops year-round, especially those that enjoy cool 
weather.
 
You can get vegetable plants started in your garden in two ways. Some crops — 
such as beans, peas, carrots, and squash — normally are sown directly in the 
garden soil, where they’ll grow. Other plants — such as tomatoes, peppers, 
and eggplants, which take a long time to mature their crops — grow best if 
they’re transplanted (in fact, they’re called transplants). These plants get an 
early start in a greenhouse or in your house four to six weeks before you set 
them in their permanent garden location. This head start is critical in cold 
areas that have short summers. Find out more about starting seeds indoors in 
Chapter 12. Other vegetables, like cucumber, broccoli, onion, and lettuce — go 
either way. Base your decision on how much time you have and on whether 
your favorite varieties are more readily available as transplants or as seeds.
 
The easiest way to organize your planting schedule is to make a calendar. 
Begin by marking your average last spring frost date; then fill in the planting 
dates for different crops. You could write “Plant peas” two weeks before the 
last frost date, for example. If you do most of your gardening on weekends, 
fill in the nearest weekend date. Use your calendar to guide your indoor 

201
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
seed-starting, too. If you plan to grow your peppers indoors for eight weeks, 
and you intend to plant them in the garden a week after the last frost date, 
count back seven weeks from the last frost date and write “Start peppers 
indoors.” A calendar like this will simplify your planting and ensure you don’t 
forget anything.
Sowing seeds and setting out transplants
The general rule for planting seeds is to plant them twice as deep as the 
seeds are wide, but your best bet is to follow the guidelines on the seed 
packet. Keep the soil evenly moist after planting. If you’re unsure what the 
crop seedlings look like, plant seeds in rows. That way, you’ll be able to dif-
ferentiate and remove weed seedlings between and within the rows.
If you’re transplanting plants that were started indoors or in a greenhouse, 
give them at least a week to harden off (become acclimated to harsher outdoor 
conditions) before planting them outside. Use your planting calendar to help 
you time your transplants. Find out more about sowing seeds and growing 
your own transplants, hardening off, and planting techniques in Chapter 12.
When you plant vegetable transplants in the garden, you can set some types 
deeper in the soil than they grew in their pots. I plant peppers, eggplants, 
tomatoes, and cabbage-type plants right up to their first set of true leaves, the 
ones that look like miniature adult leaves. Planting more deeply gives plants 
stability, and some plants form roots along the buried stem.
 
At planting time, loosely wrap a strip of newspaper 2 to 3 inches wide around 
each vegetable seedling’s stem to prevent cutworms from chewing through it. 
The paper should extend at least an inch above and below the soil.
Feed me: Fertilizing
When seeds are up and growing, and the transplants are planted, some gar-
deners give them all a dose of fertilizer. Mild liquid organic fertilizers, such 
as fish emulsion and seaweed mix, provide nitrogen and other essential nutri-
ents for early growth. Follow label directions for dilution rates.
Depending on the health of your soil, you may also consider applying a granular 
organic fertilizer, such as 5-3-3, to keep plants growing strong. (See Chapter 6 
for more on organic fertilizers.) Heavy-feeding vegetables — such as corn, 
tomatoes, and broccoli — may need monthly doses of fertilizer to perform 
their best, whereas light feeders — such as beans, radishes, and peas — may 
need little or no additional fertilizer.

202
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Apply fertilizer according to the label instructions. Sprinkle granular fertilizer 
6 to 8 inches from plant stems, and scratch it gently into the soil. Water the 
soil to dissolve and disperse the fertilizer. Use a watering can to apply liquid 
fertilizer around the bases of the plants.
 
If you have healthy soil you may not need to fertilize. Even organic fertilizers 
can accumulate in the soil, causing a harmful salt buildup that damages plant 
roots. Also, excess fertilizer can run off into streams, causing water pollution. 
If you give your plants too much nitrogen at the wrong time, you may even 
prevent some vegetables from forming fruit. Tomatoes, peppers, and egg-
plants, for example, may grow loads of lush foliage but few flowers or fruit.
Weeding and watering
As soon as you see signs of vegetables germinating — or even before — you’ll 
likely see weeds too. Get familiar with what your vegetables will look like 
when they’re small so that you don’t pull them out instead of the weeds. 
Planting in rows and marking seedlings carefully will help you distinguish 
crop from weed.
The best way to control weeds is to hand-pull or slice them off with a hoe 
when they’re young; you disturb less soil that way, and the weeds are easier 
to pull at that time than when they’re more mature. When you finish, mulch 
around the vegetables to conserve moisture and help control weeds. (Head 
to Chapter 11 for more about weeding and mulching.)
 
Watering is critical during the early stages of plant growth, but it’s also essen-
tial when the plants are forming and ripening fruits. Mulching is an excellent 
way to conserve soil moisture, but you may need to do some supplemental 
watering, depending on your weather and where you live. Rather than water 
with overhead sprinklers or with your garden hose, consider using soaker 
hoses to apply water directly to the soil. You’ll minimize disease problems 
and waste less water.
Garden tricks and season extenders
Experienced gardeners pick up a few methods along the way that make certain 
crops grow better. Consider trying these nifty tricks to save space, produce 
better-quality veggies, and extend your growing season beyond the first and 
last frost dates.
A trifecta of tactics: Trellises, fences, and cages
If you’re short on space in your garden or want to plant more than you really 
have room for, go vertical! You can save space and energy by trellising, fenc-
ing, or caging certain vegetables. Climbing vegetables, such as peas and pole 

203
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
beans, need fences or poles to grow on. These devices save space; also, these 
crops produce best when they’re allowed to climb. Set up a teepee of 6- to 
8-foot poles, attach chicken wire to fence posts, or train the plants on an 
A-frame. (If you use the teepee method, wind some twine around the poles at 
6-inch intervals to give the vines something to cling to or wind around.)
Cucumbers, melons, and even some squash love to vine and ramble. You 
can direct their energy by growing them on a trellis. Place the trellis on an 
angle, such as an A-frame design (shown in Figure 13-1), instead of straight 
up and down.
 
If you’re growing vines with heavy fruits, such as melons or squash, make sure 
that the trellis is very sturdy.
Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants all can be caged or staked with a pole to 
keep them growing upright, elevate their fruits off the ground (which can 
help prevent disease and damage from slugs, mice, and other ground-
dwelling critters), and give you more produce in less space. Commercial 
growers tie wire or twine between fence posts and weave the growing tomato 
plants through it. Also, 4- to 5-foot-high wire cages made of hog fencing 
or concrete reinforcing wire work well. Secure the cages with a tall stake 
pounded into the ground to prevent them from blowing over.

Floating row covers
Floating row covers are among the best things ever to happen to veggie gar-
deners. The material, which is like cheesecloth, is lightweight and lets air, 
light, and water through it, but it blocks insects that can attack vegetables. 
Also, when row covers are used on newly sown plants in the spring, they 
keep the air and soil a little warmer, thereby helping seeds germinate faster 
and young plants grow more quickly.
I use floating row covers on my peppers in spring to ensure an early harvest 
of fruits, because pepper flowers need warm air temperatures. The row 
covers help at the other end of the season, too, by holding in heat and mod-
erating the cool autumn-night temperatures.
 
For vegetables that require pollination by insects, such as pumpkins and 
squash, remove row covers as soon as you see the first flowers. For crops that 
don’t need pollination by bees, such as lettuce and broccoli, you can leave 
the row cover on throughout the growing season — as long as it doesn’t hold 
in too much heat. The row cover prevents cabbage moths, aphids, and other 
pests from getting to your vegetables. You can support a row cover with wire 
hoops or just lay it right on the top of vegetables. It’s so lightweight that the 
veggies will lift it as they grow.
Staying warm with cold frames
A clever way to start your growing season earlier in the spring and keep it 
going long into the frosty fall is to make or buy a cold frame. Cold frames 
are bottomless, insulated boxes made of wood, hay bales, metal, or plastic; 
they work like miniature greenhouses. The lid of the box is angled slightly 
to increase its exposure to the sun; its plastic or glass top keeps the inside 
much warmer than the outside air temperature. Even in the coldest climates, 
you can use a cold frame to grow food year-round.
In the spring, grow a crop of lettuce in a cold frame, and get your other warm-
season crops off to an early start. In the fall and winter, try cold-tolerant spin-
ach, kale, and leeks.
You can make your cold frame large enough to fit over a raised bed in the 
garden, or keep it small and portable to move around as needed. Cold frames 
are also handy for hardening off seedlings before transplanting them to the 
garden.
 
The key to using cold frames is ventilating them as needed by propping open 
the sash or top window. Even on very cool but sunny days, the inside of the 
box really heats up, much like a car with its windows rolled up. Automatic 
vent openers, available from greenhouse suppliers, raise and lower the top 
automatically without electricity, depending on the air temperature. For more 
on gardening with cold frames, get a copy of Eliot Coleman’s excellent book 
Four-Season Harvest (Chelsea Green Publishing Co.).

 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
Harvest time
Picking is one of my favorite activities, second only to eating. The temptation 
is to go out and harvest as soon as I see something growing. This technique 
works well for crops that taste best when they’re harvested young, including 
beans, summer squash, cucumbers, lettuce, and peas. The more you pick of 
these crops, the more they produce! In fact, if you allow some vegetables to 
become too mature on these plants, they may stop producing altogether.
For many other crops, however, you have to be patient. Tomatoes, peppers, 
carrots, and beets taste best when they’re allowed to ripen and grow to matu-
rity in the soil or on the plant. When in doubt, take a bite. If the flavor doesn’t 
suit your taste buds, wait a few days before you try again.
Most vegetables taste sweetest and are most tender when they’re freshly 
picked. In our house, I start the water boiling on the stove before I head out-
side to harvest the corn for supper. Peas, summer squash, and string beans 
are also sweet and juicy if they’re picked just before eating. Other vegetables, 
such as most varieties of winter squash, need a week or two at 60 to 70 
degrees Fahrenheit to cure after harvest to develop their full flavor. Read the 
next section to get more specifics on each vegetable.
Vegetables from A to Z
Seed catalogs have so many delicious veggies to choose from that you may 
have a tough time knowing where to start — and stop! If you’re growing your 
first garden, grow just a few of your favorite vegetables, and stick to one 
variety of each. As you gain experience, add more kinds, and experiment 
with one or two new crops each year. If something doesn’t work out the way 
you expected it to, try a different variety or growing method, or abandon it 
and give the garden space to another crop. For me, that’s one of the beauti-
ful things about vegetable gardens — you get to start with a clean slate each 
year and get the chance to improve and change your garden based on last 
year’s experiences.
In the following descriptions of vegetables, I include some choice varieties, 
planting and care recommendations, harvest tips, and specific pests you 
need to watch out for.
 
Many organic gardeners prefer to buy seeds and young transplants that were 
produced organically. More and more seed companies are offering organic 
seeds, and some specialize in them (refer to Chapter 12). Support your local 
organic growers by buying vegetable transplants from them if they offer trans-
plants for sale.

Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Alliums: Onions, shallots, garlic, and leeks
Onions, garlic, shallots, and leeks belong to a group of pungent plants called 
alliums. These plants generally form bulbs or enlarged below-ground stems. 
Many members of the allium family make lovely additions to the flower garden.
 
✓ Planting: Alliums like well-drained, fertile, loose soil and appreciate 
raised beds. They grow well in cool weather and can take a light frost. 
Sow onion and leek seeds indoors 8 to 10 weeks before transplanting the 
plants into the garden. Keep the tops trimmed to about 3 inches high 
until transplant time.
 
 In moderate climates, sow seeds in fall for a spring harvest. Plant shallot 
and onion sets in the spring for a late-summer harvest. Cloves of garlic 
are best planted in fall, even in cold climates, to overwinter and mature 
the following summer.
 
✓ Care: Keep your alliums weed free, well watered, and fertilized with a 
high-phosphorous fertilizer (such as bonemeal) to promote large bulb 
growth.
 
✓ Harvesting: When the tops begin to yellow, onions usually are ready for 
harvest. After pulling them out of the ground, either use them fresh or 
allow them to cure in a warm, airy room for a few weeks before storing 
in a cold basement. Use sweet onion varieties within a few weeks.
 
 Shallots, pungent onions, and some garlic varieties, however, can last 
for months in storage.
 
 Pull leeks as needed in fall, after cool weather sweetens their taste. 
Many varieties can withstand 20-degree Fahrenheit temperatures. When 
temperatures drop below that, mulch leeks with a blanket of straw, pull-
ing it aside to harvest into winter.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Onion maggots probably are the worst pests of 
allium-family crops, feeding on onion roots and bulbs. Mulching, crop 
rotation, and row covers help reduce the risks from these pests.
Onions
Choosing an onion variety is more complicated than choosing most other 
vegetables, because onions fall into different groups based on sulfur content 
and the day length they need to form bulbs. Pungent varieties contain more 
sulfur, which makes them keep longer in storage and produce more tears 
when you cut them. Sweet varieties don’t have as much sulfur and need to be 
used sooner after harvest. Adverse growing conditions — weed competition, 
drought, and poor fertility, for example — can increase onions’ sulfur content, 
even in the sweet varieties.

207
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
Onions are also referred to as short-day, long-day, and intermediate:
 
✓ Short-day varieties form bulbs when they receive 11 to 12 hours of 
daylight. If you live south of 35 degrees latitude (from northern South 
Carolina through Oklahoma and Arizona to central California), choose 
short-day varieties.
 
✓ Intermediate varieties require days that are 12 to 14 hours long to form 
bulbs and are good for middle latitudes.
 
✓ Long-day varieties need 14 to 16 hours of daylight and are best for 
northern climates.
When in doubt, try a widely adapted, day-neutral variety such as Candy.
You can start onions from seeds, transplants, and sets, which are small 
dormant bulbs.
Garlic
Garlic varieties come in two types: soft-neck and hard-neck. Soft-neck kinds pro-
duce 12 to 18 small cloves and are best for long-term storage. Hard-neck types 
produce 6 to 12 large cloves and don’t keep as long in storage. Dozens of gour-
met garlic varieties differ in climate preference, size, storage life, and pungency. 
Ask around at farmers’ markets for advice on the best varieties for your region.
 
Don’t plant regular supermarket garlic; it may have been treated with a post-
harvest sprout inhibiter to keep it from growing more. Planting store-bought 
organic garlic should be safe, though, because it should sprout normally when 
planted.
Shallots and leeks
Shallots are mild-tasting small onions and the easiest to grow of all the edible 
alliums. Another onion relative, the leek, is indispensable in European cook-
ing and is easy to grow in raised beds.
Asparagus
Asparagus plants are either female or male, and the best varieties of aspara-
gus are the ones dubbed all-male. The female plants produce seeds, which 
reduces the amount of energy they put into producing spears. The males 
don’t produce seeds and, therefore, produce more edible-size spears. 
Good all-male varieties include the Jersey series. UC 157 is a good one for 
California. Purple Passion produces large, sweet, purple spears.
 
✓ Planting: Asparagus is a perennial vegetable that can live for 20 years, 
so take special care to create a proper planting bed. Choose a sunny 
location with well-drained soil. Dig a 1-foot-deep trench, and add 6 

208
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
inches of compost or well-rotted manure. Form 8-inch-high mounds 18 
inches apart in the trench, and lay the spiderlike asparagus roots over 
the mounds, as shown in Figure 13-2.
 
 The crowns (where the roots meet the stems) should be about 5 to 
6 inches below the soil surface. Cover them with 2 inches of soil and 
gradually backfill the trench, an inch or two at a time over the course 
of several weeks as the asparagus spears grow, until the trench is level 
with the surrounding soil.
 
✓ Care: Fertilize the bed each spring with compost and a complete fertil-
izer. Keep the bed weed free and well watered.
 
✓ Harvesting: Don’t harvest any asparagus spears for the first year after 
planting. Let the crowns build up strength. The second year, harvest in 
spring only those spears larger than a pencil diameter for 3 to 4 weeks. 
In subsequent years, harvest spears for up to 2 months. Then allow the 
remaining spears to grow to rejuvenate the crown.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Asparagus beetle is a hard-to-kill pest of asparagus. 
The adults damage the spears, and larvae eat the fernlike leaves. Control 
them by removing the ferns in late fall, and spray with pyrethrins in 
spring at first signs of this pest. Foraging hens can also help keep the 
pest in check.

Cole crops: Broccoli, cauliflower, 
cabbage, and company
These closely related plants have the same growing requirements, diseases, 
and pests. All these vegetables thrive in cool spring and autumn weather, and 
tolerate frost. Check days to maturity, which can vary widely among varieties.

209
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
In addition to the familiar broccoli varieties, such as Premium Crop and 
Packman, consider including some broccoli raab and rapini, which have 
smaller stems and a stronger flavor. Try one of the new orange, purple, or 
green cauliflowers, which contain more vitamins and antioxidants than regu-
lar white varieties. Some new cabbage varieties produce smaller heads that 
are easier to use and store. Consider including savoy, red, and Chinese cab-
bages too. Kale is considered to be one of the most nutritious vegetables, so 
be sure to include a few varieties. Other cole crops to try include Brussels 
sprouts, kohlrabi, and collards.
 
✓ Planting: Sow seeds directly into the ground or start transplants 
indoors 4 to 6 weeks before transplanting them outside. Take advantage 
of cool weather by sowing cole crops in early spring for an early-summer 
harvest or in late summer for a fall harvest. Some cole crops can be 
grown through the winter in mild-winter areas for harvest in spring.
 
✓ Care: Cole crops need a moderate amount of fertilizer and water 
throughout the growing season to grow well; they also like well-drained 
soil. Fertilize at planting and 1 month later with a complete fertilizer. 
Place organic mulch such as straw around plants after transplanting to 
help keep the soil cool and moist.
 
✓ Harvesting: Harvest broccoli when the heads (clusters of flowers) are 
tightly packed and still green, cutting just below the head. In most cases, 
new but smaller broccoli heads will grow farther down the stem. If the 
yellow flowers begin to open, the taste becomes bitter, and the plant will 
stop producing more heads.
 
 Harvest cabbage when it’s firm to the squeeze. Cut the plants as 
described for broccoli. To harvest white or blanched cauliflower, wrap 
the upper plant leaves around the developing 3- to 4-inch heads. Harvest 
within 4 to 10 days. Harvest Brussels sprouts after cool weather in fall 
when the sprouts are still firm by twisting them off the stem. Pick kale 
and collard leaves as needed.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Cabbageworms and cabbage loopers are the two pri-
mary pests of cole crops. The larvae feed on the leaves, decimating the 
plant quickly. Handpick the caterpillars, or spray Bacillus thuringiensis 
(Bt) to control them (refer to Chapter 8). Cabbage maggots attack the 
roots of cole crops. Place row covers over the plants to prevent the flies 
from laying eggs at the base of the plant. Also, black rot and club root 
damage the roots and heads of cole crops; crop rotation is the best con-
trol for these diseases.
Eggplant
Eggplant, like its cousins peppers and tomatoes, loves hot weather, plenty 
of water, and full sun. Eggplants come in many size and color varieties. In 

210
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
addition to the dark purple, oval types, try lavender-streaked Rosa Bianca, 
long and narrow Ichiban and Thai Long, and round Easter Egg and Turkish 
Orange.
 
✓ Planting: Start seeds indoors 8 weeks before transplanting outside. Wait 
until the soil has warmed to at least 60 degrees before transplanting. In 
colder climates or small gardens, consider planting eggplants in large 
containers to save space and encourage them to grow faster. Eggplants 
in containers also are very ornamental and look great as decorative 
plants. Here in cool Vermont, I grow the best eggplants by covering 
them with a floating row cover to hold in the heat.
 
✓ Care: Eggplants like moderate fertility and water, so fertilize monthly 
and mulch with black landscape fabric. But go easy on the nitrogen fer-
tilizer; otherwise, you’ll have too much foliage and too few flowers and 
fruits.
 
✓ Harvesting: Harvest eggplants when they’ve reached the desired size for 
eating. Harvest before the skin color becomes dull-looking — a sign of 
overmaturity and mushiness.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Verticillium wilt disease is a main problem for egg-
plants. This disease causes the entire plant to wilt and die in summer. 
The easiest solution for this soil-borne disease is planting eggplants in 
containers filled with sterilized potting soil. Colorado potato beetles also 
love eggplant leaves. Handpicking adults, crushing eggs, and spraying 
with Bt san diego control the larval stage of this pest. See Chapter 8 for 
more on Bacillus thuringiensis varieties.
Leafy greens: Lettuce, Swiss chard, 
spinach, and friends
Leafy greens are easy crops to grow because you don’t have to wait for the 
flowers or fruits, as you do with cucumbers or tomatoes — you just eat the 
leaves!
Lettuce varieties are categorized by the way their leaves grow. Head lettuces, 
such as iceberg types, form compact balls of leaves. Loose-leaf lettuces, at the 
other end of the spectrum, have loosely arranged leaves that don’t form tight 
heads. Other types — such as butterhead, romaine, and oakleaf — fall some-
where in between.
Consider planting loose-leaf lettuce seed mixes, which contain several vari-
eties and are beautiful in both the garden and the salad bowl. Other leafy 
vegetable garden staples include Swiss chard, spinach, and an array of 

211
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
less well-known salad and cooking greens. Some Swiss chard varieties are 
ornamental and edible, such as red-stemmed Ruby and multicolored Bright 
Lights. In regions where temperatures warm quickly in spring, look for spin-
ach varieties described as slow to bolt, such as Space, Tyee, and Bloomsdale 
Longstanding.
In the specialty greens category, grow arugula, dandelion, cress, chicory, 
mache, and mustard to give salad a zippy flavor. Many of these greens are 
blended in mixes called mesclun. Mescluns may be spicy or mild flavored, but 
I guarantee that they have more flavor than just a simple bowl of lettuce.
For Asian cooking, grow bok choi, tatsoi, and mizuna. You can add these 
leafy vegetables to stir-fries or mix them into the salad bowl. Bok choi forms 
a loose cluster of juicy stems and dark green leaves. Tatsoi grows in a low 
rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that regrow if you cut them. Mizuna has slen-
der stalks and fringed leaves.
 
✓ Planting: Most greens are cool-season crops, so sow seeds or set trans-
plants outdoors a few weeks before the last frost date. You can start 
some leafy greens, such as lettuce, indoors 3 to 4 weeks before you set 
them outdoors, giving plants a jump on the growing season. Stagger 
your crops of greens by planting small patches a couple of weeks apart 
throughout the season. These plants mature quickly, and you’ll want a 
consistent harvest of greens.
 
✓ Care: Leafy greens need nitrogen first and foremost. Add compost 
before planting, and add a supplemental nitrogen fertilizer such as fish 
emulsion every few weeks. Mulch the plants after they’re established 
with an organic hay or straw mulch to keep the soil cool and moist 
and to prevent soil from splashing onto leaves. Keeping the plants well 
watered will help prevent leaf-tip burn on lettuce.
 
✓ Harvesting: Harvest lettuce and greens when you’re hungry and when-
ever leaves are big enough to eat. Pick off the lower leaves first so that 
new, younger leaves continue to grow from the center of the plant. 
When greens such as arugula and lettuce bolt (send up a flower stalk), 
the leaves probably are too bitter for most tastes; you should pull up 
and compost the plants.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Snails and slugs can devour a patch in no time. 
You can trap them; set up barriers; bait them; and, of course, handpick 
them to keep the populations low. Rabbits and woodchucks can also 
be a problem — fencing is the best cure for them. Leaf-miner insects, 
especially on spinach, can ruin individual leaves. Just pick them off and 
destroy the damaged leaves, and the plant will be fine. See Chapters 7 
and 8 for more information on managing pests.

212
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Legumes: Peas and beans
You have hundreds of bean varieties to choose from. Dry beans in particular 
have colorful regional names and histories.
Beans enjoy warm weather; wait until after the last spring frost, when the soil 
has warmed to at least 60 degrees, to sow seeds in the garden. Bean plants 
grow by forming low bushy plants or climbing up a pole or trellis. In some 
cases, you can find pole and bush versions of the same variety. You can eat 
beans fresh or allow the pods to mature for dry beans used in cooking.
Peas produce better in cool weather, so plant them as soon as the soil has 
dried out in spring. Pea varieties fall into two camps: those with edible pods 
and those grown just for fresh or dried seeds, called English peas. Peas with 
edible pods either have flat pods (snow peas) or fat, juicy pods (called snap 
or sugar peas).
 
✓ Planting: Legumes are easy to grow because the seeds are so large and 
easy to plant. Sow directly in well-drained soil.
 
✓ Care: After they’re growing, pole beans need poles for support, whereas 
tall pea varieties need a fence to climb on. Keep the beds well weeded 
and watered. Legumes generally don’t need supplemental fertilizer 
because they have the unique ability to make their own nitrogen fertil-
izer through a relationship with soil-dwelling bacteria called rhizobia.
 
✓ Harvesting: Harvest beans when the pods are about 6 inches long, 
before the pods get bumpy from the seeds forming. Harvest dry beans 
after the pods have yellowed and withered. If they don’t dry in the 
garden, you can pull up the whole plants and hang them to dry in an airy 
garage.
 
 Harvest snap and English peas when the pods fill and are firm to the 
squeeze. Keep checking and tasting when the pods begin to size up to 
be sure that you harvest at the peak of sweetness. Harvest snow peas at 
any point after the pods form.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: The Mexican bean beetle causes the most trouble. 
Handpick them or use predatory insects such as soldier bugs to control 
them. Pea aphids attack pea plants and are easy to kill with just a stream 
of water from a hose. Watch out for rabbits and woodchucks — fences 
work best. Rust fungal disease attacks beans and spreads quickly, 
especially if you work in the bean patch while the leaves are still wet. 
The plants and beans develop yellow spots, which can kill the plant. 
Clean up plant debris in fall, and stay away from the bean patch in wet 
weather. See Chapters 8 through and 10 for more about managing pests 
and diseases.

213
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
Peppers
Peppers are warm-weather crops that come in a rainbow of colors. Peppers 
generally are grouped according to their taste: hot or sweet.
Capsaicin gives hot peppers their heat. Use care when handling hot peppers; 
take care not to rub your eyes or an open wound, because the capsaicin can 
cause painful burning. (Researchers are also studying capsaicin’s antimicro-
bial properties, its ability to relieve pain, and its potential to prevent cancer.)
 
Peppers are sometimes rated in Scoville heat units (SHU) based on the 
amount of capsaicin they contain. Sweet peppers contain no capsaicin and get 
a rating of 0; medium-hot jalepeños, a rating around 4,000; and fiery-hot haba-
ñeros, a rating of 200,000 or more. How much capsaicin a pepper contains 
depends on factors other than variety, such as water availability, so use the 
scale as a general guideline to help you choose varieties.
Peppers are also great plants for container growing. Some varieties are very 
ornamental, such as Pretty in Purple, which has colorful purple to red fruit 
and purple-tinged stems and leaves.
 
✓ Planting: Start seeds indoors 8 weeks before setting plants outside. Wait 
until the soil has warmed to 60 degrees before transplanting.
 
✓ Care: Peppers need fertile soil and plenty of water to grow well. In cool 
areas, consider growing them in black fabric mulch to heat the soil and 
keep weeds away. Fertilize monthly with a complete fertilizer, and add 1 
tablespoon of Epsom salt to the water to help the peppers grow better. 
Don’t overfertilize peppers with nitrogen fertilizer, though; you’ll get 
more foliage than flowers and fruits.
 
✓ Harvesting: Pepper fruits turn a rainbow of colors, depending on the 
variety, as they mature. The beautiful part about peppers is that you can 
pick them at the green stage or allow them to mature, when they reach 
their sweetest flavor. Hot peppers also can be harvested at any stage, 
but the flavor is hotter and better developed when the peppers are 
allowed to mature.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: The pepper maggot is among the most frustrat-
ing pests of sweet peppers. The adult fly lays an egg on the developing 
fruits; the egg hatches into small, white worms that tunnel into the fruit; 
the tunneling causes the fruit to rot. Cover the plants with row covers 
early in the season to discourage adults from laying eggs. Sprays are of 
little use because the worm is inside the fruit.
 
 Fruitworms and wilt disease also cause trouble; consult Chapters 8 and 
9 to learn more about these pests.

214
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Potatoes
Look for early-, mid-, and late-season potato varieties to stretch out your 
harvest. Early potatoes are ready to harvest about 65 days after planting — 
perfect for summer potato salads. Midseason varieties mature in 75 to 80 
days, and late ones take 90 days or more to harvest. The later varieties keep 
longer in storage.
Potatoes are also roughly divided into baking and boiling varieties. Baking 
potatoes have drier, more mealy-textured flesh; boiling potatoes are moist 
and waxy. Look for colorful varieties such as All Blue, All Red, and lavender-
skinned Caribe.
If you’re looking for something new to try, plant some fingerling potatoes. 
These varieties produce long, slim, tasty tubers and tend to yield more per 
pound planted than regular potatoes. My favorites include Russian Banana, 
which has yellow flesh and skin, and French Fingerling and Rose Finn Apple, 
which have pink skin and yellow flesh.
 
✓ Planting: Potatoes are another cool-season root crop that can be 
planted a few weeks before your last frost date. They grow rather unpre-
tentiously and without much maintenance until late summer, when you 
dig the roots. Potatoes grow best in loose soil that hasn’t been amended 
with fertilizer. Too much nitrogen fertilizer in particular can lead to poor 
tuber formation.
 
 Purchase seed potatoes (small tubers), cutting the largest ones into 
smaller pieces with at least one “eye” or bud. Avoid planting supermar-
ket potatoes, because they may have been sprayed with a sprout inhibi-
tor. (Store-bought organic potatoes are okay to plant.) Place them in 
1-foot-deep trenches about 1 foot apart. Fill in the trench with soil as the 
plants sprout and grow, eventually mounding or hilling around the tops 
of the plants with soil, as shown in Figure 13-3. Hilling the soil around 
the plants allows the roots to form more potatoes, kills weeds, and pro-
tects the tubers from the light. Tubers exposed to light turn green and 
have an off flavor.
 
✓ Care: Keep the soil moist by watering or applying organic mulches such 
as hay or straw.
 
✓ Harvesting: When the potato tops turn yellow and begin to die back, it’s 
time to dig up the tubers. With a shovel or iron fork, carefully dig around 
the potato plants, and lift up the tubers. Let them cure in a dark, airy, 
50-degree room for a few weeks; then store them in a cool basement at 
about 40 degrees. Eat any damaged potatoes immediately.

215
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
 
 Never store potatoes and apples near one another. Apples give off ethyl-
ene gas, which causes potatoes and other vegetables to spoil.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: The Colorado potato beetle is the most famous pest. 
This yellow- and black-striped beetle lays orange eggs on the undersides 
of leaves; these eggs hatch into voracious orange-red larvae that devour 
potato and eggplant leaves. Handpick the adults and crush the eggs. 
Spray Bt san diego to control the larvae.
 
 Wireworms tunnel into potato tubers, causing them to rot. They’re a 
problem mostly in new gardens created from lawns.
 
 Fungal diseases, such as potato scab and blight, can ruin a crop. Your 
first defense is to buy resistant varieties. Control potato scab by lower-
ing the soil pH to below 6, and avoid using manure fertilizer. Control 
blight by planting your potato crop in a new place every year, buying 
certified disease-free tubers, mulching, and keeping weeds under con-
trol. See Part III for more information on managing pests and weeds.

Root crops: Carrots, beets, and radishes
Root crops provide good eating well into the fall and winter, and they’re easy 
to grow. Raised beds filled with loose, fertile, stone-free soil provide just the 
right environment. In addition to the usual orange carrots, consider growing 
white, yellow, and purple varieties. If your soil is heavy or rocky, try shorter, 
stubbier varieties like Danvers Half-Long and Parisian Market. Beets come 
in a range of colors in addition to the common dark red, including white, 
orange, and red-and-white-striped Chioggia. Like hot peppers, radish variet-
ies differ in how hot or pungent they are, so choose varieties according to 
your taste preference.

Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Planting: Directly sow root crop seeds a few weeks before the last frost 
date for your area. Sow the seeds lightly and cover them with sand, 
potting soil, or grass clippings to keep them moist. Radishes germinate 
within a few days; carrots may take 2 weeks. I usually mix radish and 
carrot seeds to help mark the row and harvest the radishes before the 
carrots need the space.
 
✓ Care: Root crops generally need loose soil well amended with compost, 
weed-free growing conditions, and consistently moist soil to thrive. 
Thin the seedlings so the eventual spacing is about 2 to 4 inches apart, 
depending on the crop. If you don’t thin root crops when they’re young, 
they won’t get large enough to eat. You can eat the thinned beet greens.
 
✓ Harvesting: Pull up radishes when the roots get large enough to eat. 
Leave carrots and beets in the ground to harvest as needed. Their flavor 
gets sweeter after the soil cools. You can even cover carrots in late fall 
with a cold frame, fill it with hay mulch, and harvest carrots all winter.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Other than four-legged critters such as rabbits, 
which love to eat the carrot and beet tops, the biggest pest of carrots 
is the rust fly. The adult fly lays an egg near the carrot, and the small 
larvae tunnel into the carrot root. Cover the crop with a row cover to 
prevent the flies from laying eggs. Swallowtail butterfly larvae also like 
to munch on carrot tops, so try to grow enough for all of you!
Sweet corn
As soon as you harvest corn, the sugars in the kernels begin to turn to 
starch, making the corn less sweet as time goes by. But many new sweet-corn 
varieties stay sweeter longer after harvest because plant breeders breed 
them to contain supersweet characteristics. These varieties — which include 
Bodacious (yellow), Honey N’Pearl (bicolor), and How Sweet It Is (white) — 
must be planted at least 25 to 100 feet from other, non-supersweet varieties. 
If another variety pollinates a supersweet variety, the kernels may be tough 
and starchy. Another way to separate varieties is to stagger the planting 
dates so only one type of corn is in flower at a time.
If you’re satisfied with regular, old-fashioned varieties, choose those with 
yellow, white, or both-colored (bicolor) kernels. If you plant yellow and white 
varieties in close proximity, you may get bicolor corn anyway. Some of my 
favorites include Silver Queen (white) and Early Sunglow (yellow).
 
✓ Planting: Sow seeds in blocks of 4 to 5 short rows after the soil has 
warmed to 65 degrees. Separate blocks of different corn varieties by at 
least 25 feet so that no cross-pollination occurs.

217
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
 
✓ Care: Sweet corn needs well-drained, highly fertile soil and warm 
weather to grow well. Hoe soil up around the plants when they’re 8 
inches tall to support them during windy days and to destroy young 
weeds that compete with the corn plants. Fertilize at planting (with com-
post) and again when the corn is knee-high (with a high-nitrogen fertil-
izer such as soybean meal). Fertilize a final time with the same fertilizer 
when the silk emerges at the tips of the ears.
 
✓ Harvesting: Start checking for maturity when the corn ears feel full and 
the silks are brown. You can take a peek under the husks at the corn ear 
tip to see whether the kernels have matured. Pick the ears on the young 
side for the sweetest flavor.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Major corn pests include the corn earworm and 
corn borer. The earworm larvae tunnel into the tip of the corn ear, caus-
ing only cosmetic damage; the ear is still edible. Either spray Bt on the 
silks or apply a few drops of mineral oil when ears are young to kill the 
earworm larvae. Varieties with extra-tight husks, such as Tuxedo, resist 
damage.
 
 Corn-borer larvae cause more major damage to a plant by tunneling into 
the leaves and stalk. Bt sprays and crop rotation can help lessen the 
problems from corn borers.
 
 Raccoons are the other major corn pests. Raccoons love corn and seem 
to know when it’s ripe. An electric fence is the best — and maybe the 
only — defense against these clever animals.
Tomatoes
Easily the most popular garden vegetable, the tomato comes in a variety 
of sizes, shapes, and colors. The plants, however, fall into two categories. 
Determinate varieties stop growing taller when they reach a certain height 
and need minimal support, making them ideal for containers. Indeterminate 
varieties just keep on growing taller and taller, like Jack’s beanstalk! 
Indeterminate tomatoes require trellising but yield more fruit per square foot 
of garden space.
Most gardeners grow tomatoes for three main purposes: slicing, snacks, and 
sauce. Some of my favorite standard, round, slicing tomato varieties include 
Celebrity and Early Girl (red), Brandywine (pink), Lemon Boy (yellow), Big 
Rainbow (striped yellow and red), and Big Beef (red). For snacking, I like 
cherry-tomato varieties Sun Gold (gold), Super Sweet 100 (red), Sweet Million 
(red), and Yellow Pear (yellow). My favorite plum tomatoes, which I use to 
make sauce, include Amish Paste, Roma, Bellstar, Heinz 2653, and Viva Italia.

218
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Planting and care: Tomatoes grow best when transplanted into 
60-degree soil and kept warm. Plant tall and leggy tomato transplants up 
to within 4 inches of their tops in a deep hole, or lay them on their side 
in a trench (see Figure 13-4), and the stem will root. Place a tomato cage 
or trellis support around the plants at planting time. Tie or wind indeter-
minate varieties around their supports as they grow, and prune off extra 
side shoots to keep the plant from getting too bushy.
 
✓ Care: Mulching with black landscape fabric in cool areas helps speed 
the growth of tomato plants. Tomatoes need fertile soil, so amend the 
soil with compost before planting and then side-dress plants monthly 
with a complete fertilizer. Keep the plants mulched and well watered to 
prevent blossom-end rot (discoloration and decay on the end opposite 
the stem) as fruits mature.
 
✓ Harvesting: Allow the fruits to turn red (or yellow, gold, or whatever the 
mature color). The longer you leave them on the vine, the deeper the 
color, and the sweeter and fuller the fruit flavor. Even if you pick too early, 
however, fruits continue ripening if they’re placed in a warm, airy room.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: The main insect pests are tomato hornworms and 
tomato fruitworms. Both of these caterpillars can be controlled with 
Bt, although you can easily handpick hornworms because they’re so 
large. Nematodes can also attack tomato roots, causing the roots to be 
deformed and the plants to be stunted and unproductive. Choose 
nematode-resistant varieties if these microscopic soil pests are a 
problem in your area.
 
 Leaf blight diseases often start as small spots on leaves and then expand 
to yellow areas, killing leaves and the plant if unchecked. To control 
these diseases, clean up crop debris at the end of the growing season, 
rotate crops, and mulch to prevent the disease spores from splash-
ing onto leaves during rains. Wilt diseases, such as verticillium and 
fusarium, can cause plants to wilt and die in midseason. Purchase plants 
that are wilt resistant (usually indicated in the variety description), and 
remove and destroy infected plants as soon as you can to prevent the 
disease from spreading.
Vining crops: Cucumbers, squash, 
pumpkins, and melons
All these crops have the common trait of growing their fruits on long, trailing 
vines, although some varieties now grow in more compact bushlike patterns. 
Many of these species can pollinate one another, too, making it nearly impos-
sible to get seeds that grow fruit resembling the original varieties.

219
 Chapter 13: Raising Organic Vegetables
 
Figure 13-4: 
Plant leggy

in a trench.
 
Cucumbers are classified as slicers (long and thin) and picklers (short and 
prickly). Squash are grouped as summer and winter varieties. Summer 
squash — such as zucchini, pattypan, and crookneck — have tender skin and 
are best eaten soon after harvest. Winter squash — such as acorn, buttercup, 
and butternut — develop hard skins and dense flesh, making them good for 
storing through the fall and early winter.
Pumpkins range in dimension from apple-size to something resembling a 
small Volkswagen Beetle. Some are used for cooking; others are better for 
carving and ornament. For pies and soup, grow New England Pie, Baby Pam, 
or Small Sugar. For carving, Howden and Connecticut Field are among the 
standards. Grow Atlantic Giant or Big Max for the big-pumpkin contest at the 
county fair.
Finally, a few good melons include Earli-Dew and Burpee Hybrid muskmelon, 
as well as French Orange, a muskmelon/Charentais cross. Charentais are 
orange-fleshed French melons that resemble muskmelons. Cantaloupes, by 
the way, have smoother skins and smaller seed cavities than muskmelons, 
but taste pretty much the same. For something delicious and unusual, grow 
green-fleshed Passport cantaloupe. Try Crimson Sweet and yellow-fleshed 
Yellow Doll watermelon, or one of the new “personal size” varieties, such as 
Little Baby Flower and Mini Yellow, that weigh in at just 2 to 4 pounds.
 
✓ Planting: Sow these vegetables directly 1 to 2 weeks after your last frost 
date, when the soil is at least 60 degrees. In colder areas, start seedlings 
indoors 3 to 4 weeks before setting them outdoors to get a head start.
 
 Even though many bush varieties are available, most squash-family 
plants need room to spread their vines, so space them according to 
seed-packet instructions.

220
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Care: These warm-weather crops need heat, water, and fertility to grow 
best. Amend the soil at planting with a layer of compost, and side-dress 
the plants with a complete fertilizer when they start vining. Keep the 
plants well watered. Protect all squash-family plants and fruits from frost.
 
 Squash-family crops need bees to pollinate the flowers to get fruit. Plant 
bee-attracting flowers around the garden to ensure fruit pollination. If 
fruits form but rot and drop off before enlarging, it’s probably due to 
poor pollination.
 
✓ Harvesting: Pick cucumbers when they are 4 to 6 inches long, before the 
seeds enlarge. Harvest summer squash when they’re small and the flow-
ers are still attached for best flavor and to keep the plants producing 
well. Harvest winter squash and pumpkins when the varieties turn the 
desired color and your thumbnail can’t puncture the skin.
 
 Harvest muskmelons when they slip off the vine easily when lifted. 
Watermelons are harvested when the skin color turns from shiny to dull 
and the spot where it rests on the ground turns from white to yellow. 
Also check the last tendrils (curlicues coming off the stems) before the 
fruit. When the tendril turns brown, it’s harvest time.
 
✓ Pests and diseases: Squash-family vegetables have their own whole set 
of insects and diseases — many named after the plants they attack. The 
most prominent ones include cucumber beetles, which are yellow- and 
black-striped or spotted beetles that feed on young cucumbers, melons, 
and squash; squash vine borers, which attack mostly squash and pump-
kins; and squash bugs. Turn to Chapter 8 for more detailed information 
on these bad guys.
 
 Bacterial wilt disease attacks mostly cucumber and melons. The plants 
wilt during the day and are slow to recover even if they’re well watered. 
Control this disease by planting resistant varieties and controlling 
cucumber beetles, which spread the disease.
Going beyond the ordinary
Looking for something different? Try some of 
these varieties in your vegetable garden:
 ✓ Celeriac (also called celery root), a gnarly, 
potato-like root vegetable that tastes like 
celery
 ✓ Daikon radish, a large white root vegetable 
with a mild radish flavor
 ✓ Edamame, soybeans that are harvested 
while green and eaten fresh
 ✓ Florence fennel (also called finocchio), 
whose basal leaves form a bulb with a 
refreshing anise flavor
 ✓ Okra, a mainstay in Southern cooking
 ✓ Parsnip, a mild-tasting root vegetable 
resembling white carrots
 ✓ Tomatillo, a tomato relative and an essen-
tial ingredient in traditional salsas

Herbs for the Home and Garden
In This Chapter
▶ Growing and using the most common herbs
▶ Choosing herbs that attract helpful insects
D
efining herbs is no easy feat when you consider that this group includes 
plants from every continent and climate — and the word herbs refers 
to everything from shrubs and trees to short-lived annuals and tough-as-nails 
perennials. Throughout history, herbs have served as food, medicine, fra-
grance, ornament, and even magical ingredients. In the days before refrigera-
tion, people used strongly flavored chives, thyme, sage, rosemary, savory, 
basil, and mint to flavor meats. Aromatic herbs with scented flowers and 
leaves bring pleasant fragrance to homes today and still help protect woolen 
and linen fabrics from insect damage. Some medicines consist primarily of 
herbal preparations.
In this chapter, I focus on plants commonly grown to flavor foods, to add color 
and fragrance to the garden, and to make helpful companions for other crops.
Growing Herbs
How and where you choose to grow herbs is limited only by your imagination 
and, of course, by the needs and characteristics of the plants themselves. 
Most herb plants aren’t too fussy about the soil they grow in as long as it’s 
well drained. (If you’re growing herbs simply for their ornamental flowers or 
foliage, give them fertile garden soil. Herbs grown for fragrance and flavor, 
however, are more pungent if they’re grown in less fertile soil, so go easy on 
the fertilizer.)

222
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Fitting herbs into your garden
You can fit herbs into your garden and landscape in myriad ways. Tuck herbs 
into your flower garden, plant them among your vegetables, or give them a spe-
cial garden of their own. Take advantage of their flowers or leaves to add spark 
to container gardens and window boxes. Use creeping kinds between paving 
stones, or allow them to trail over retaining walls. Even if you’re challenged for 
space, you can grow some herbs on a sunny windowsill as houseplants.
If you need a few ideas on how and where to grow herbs, here’s a list for 
inspiration:
 
✓ Herb garden: Take a herbs-only approach and design an intricately pat-
terned garden. A typical arrangement consists of a geometric border of 
tidy, compact plants such as basil or lavender surrounding groups of 
herbs with contrasting foliage colors and textures.
 
✓ Ground cover: Creeping herbs such as thyme can cover large areas 
quickly or fill the gaps between stones in a path. Allow them to trail over 
a wall to add color and soften the effect of the stone.
 
✓ Vegetable garden: Some herbs make natural companions for vegetable 
plants. Basil, for example, is said to improve tomatoes, whereas dill and 
cabbage complement each other.
Using herbs
Most herbs have fragrant or pungently flavored 
leaves or flowers that make them useful for 
cooking, crafts, natural remedies, potpourri, 
and more. Consider the following ways to use 
harvested herbs:
 ✓ Food and drink: Herbal teas offer alterna-
tives to stronger brews, and no supper is 
complete without seasonings for soups and 
salads, meats, and vegetables.
 ✓ Fragrance: In the days before frequent 
bathing, central vacuum cleaners, and 
indoor plumbing, herbs played a large role 
in odor control. Today, aromatherapy, the 
art and science of affecting mood with 
scent, makes liberal use of dried herbs in 
little pillows and bowls of potpourri.
 ✓ Crafts: Herbs give color, structure, and 
fragrance to dried wreaths, arrangements, 
and other crafts. Some herbs lend their 
colors to fabrics and paints.
 ✓ Medicine: People have used herbs to treat 
every ailment known to mankind: head-
aches, depression, colds, general aches 
and pains, and so on. Check out Herbal 
Remedies For Dummies, by Christopher 
Hobbs (Wiley), for ways to use herbs as 
medicine. Laymen can safely use aromatic 
herbs to add zip or tranquilizing effects to 
ointments, massage oils, and baths.

223
 Chapter 14: Herbs for the Home and Garden
 
✓ Flower garden: Many herbs have beautiful flowers or foliage that add 
color and texture to flower borders. As a bonus, some of these plants 
attract butterflies and provide food for their larva. Good additions to 
your flower garden include catnip, lavender, chamomile, borage, and 
oregano.
 
✓ Container garden: Treat them as ornamental plants or bring your 
culinary herbs closer to the kitchen by planting them in pots, tubs, or 
baskets. In cold climates, grow tender herbs such as rosemary and bay 
in pots that you can bring indoors for the winter. Be sure to give these 
Mediterranean-climate plants 14 to 16 hours of bright light year-round to 
keep them happy. Be sure to keep the soil moist but never soggy.
Watching for invaders
Some herbs have a very bad habit: They just don’t know when to stop growing. 
These so-called invasive herbs travel in the following ways:
 
✓ Seeds: Some plants produce way more seeds than you need. Their little 
seedlings pop up everywhere, like weeds. Examples of prolific herbs 
include German chamomile, fennel, and garlic chives. Keep them in 
check by removing the flowers before they disperse seeds.
 
✓ Roots: With some herbs, such as comfrey and horseradish, your eradica-
tion efforts may lead to an even larger patch of the confounded plant. 
Any bit of root left in the soil may grow into a new plant. Introduce these 
unruly herbs to your garden with caution.
 
✓ Rhizomes and stolons: Some herbs take off cross-country, growing 
horizontal stems from their crowns that creep over or under the soil, 
forming new plants along the way. (Rhizomes grow under and stolons on 
top of the soil.) These plants are useful for covering large areas or fill-
ing gaps between paving stones, but rapidly become a nuisance in other 
situations. Tansy, mint, and artemisia can be particularly rampant; plant 
these herbs in containers or in gardens surrounded by 12-inch-deep bar-
riers that prevent the roots from getting out. Pull up escapees as soon as 
they appear.
Encyclopedia of Herbs
Useful herbs number in the hundreds — at least. In this section, I highlight 
a few of the most commonly grown herbs. For information about more 
herbs, as well as in-depth discussions, pick up a copy of Herb Gardening For 
Dummies, by Karan Davis Cutler, Kathleen Fisher, and the National Gardening 
Association (Wiley).

224
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Basil
Easily one of the most popular culinary herbs grown, basil (ocimum basilicum) 
is an annual that comes in more than 30 varieties, which include both orna-
mental and tasty forms. For plenty of pesto, grow sweet basil varieties such 
as Mammoth or Large Leaf in your vegetable garden. Or try varieties with 
unusual foliage, such as purple-leafed Dark Opal and Purple Ruffles or frilly 
Green Ruffles. To edge a garden or spice up a patio planter, grow compact, 
small-leafed varieties such as Spicy Globe and Green Globe. For an alternative 
taste sensation, grow lemon, anise, cinnamon, and Thai basil varieties.
 
✓ Planting and care: Sow seeds directly in the garden, or start indoors. 
Give basil moist, fertile, well-drained soil, and space plants about 1 foot 
apart in full sun. Water them in dry weather, and pinch off young flower 
buds to prevent bloom and encourage more leaves. Protect basil from 
frost, which will kill it.
 
✓ Special uses: Plant with tomatoes to discourage tomato hornworms. Use 
dried or fresh leaves to flavor food.
 
In recent years, a strain of fusarium disease has begun causing problems for 
basil growers. Choose at least one resistant variety, such as Nufar, for your 
herb patch.
Calendula
The beautiful flowers alone make planting calendula (Calendula officinalis) 
worthwhile. Add the fact that the flowers are edible and can be used in heal-
ing salves, and calendula becomes a must-have in the herb garden.
 
✓ Planting and care: Sow seeds directly in the garden in full sun, or start 
indoors. The plants can tolerate light frosts. If some flowers are allowed 
to form seeds, the plant will self-sow.
 
✓ Special uses: The yellow, gold, or orange flowers have a tangy and pep-
pery taste; they can be used in dyes and added to salves, soaps, and 
lotions.
Caraway
Caraway (Carum carvi), a member of the carrot family, is a biennial that pro-
duces its aromatic seeds in its second growing season, although some plants 
may bloom the first year. The plants have fine, lacy foliage topped by umbels 
of tiny white flowers.

225
 Chapter 14: Herbs for the Home and Garden
 
✓ Planting and care: Sow seeds directly in the garden in full sun, where they 
can remain for two growing seasons. In hot climates, give caraway partial 
shade. Seeds germinate slowly and have deep taproots, which bring min-
erals to the surface and loosen the soil. Plants grow 1 to 2 feet tall.
 
✓ Special uses: Add the leaves to salads or soups. Use the distinctively fla-
vored seeds in breads, stews, and other foods. The flowers attract many 
beneficial insects.
Chamomile
Choose 2- to 3-foot-tall German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) or creeping, 
9-inch Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile), depending on your garden 
desires. The perennial Roman species is hardy through Zone 3 and thrives in 
cool, damp climates. German chamomile is an annual. Both plants have lacy, 
aromatic, apple-scented foliage and small, daisylike flowers.
 
✓ Planting and care: Sow seeds directly in the garden and keep moist until 
well established. Chamomile can tolerate some drought after that and 
appreciates full sun. Harvest the flowers when fully open, and dry them 
on screens in an airy place. Plants self-sow prolifically, so after you plant 
some, you’ll have chamomile for a long time unless you remove all spent 
blooms before they develop seeds.
 
✓ Special uses: The dried flowers make a popular tea for relieving stress 
and heartburn. They’re also used in many cosmetics and toiletries. 
Roman chamomile makes an excellent ground cover or mowed lawn in 
mild, moist climates similar to England or the Pacific Northwest.
Chives
Their grassy, onion-flavored foliage makes chives (Allium schoenoprasum) 
popular in the culinary arts, but this perennial plant makes a good 1-foot-tall 
addition to the ornamental landscape and vegetable garden, too. The dense 
tufts of lavender flowers bloom in early summer. A related species, garlic 
chives, grows about 2 feet tall and has starry white flowers in late summer to 
early fall. Both species self-sow freely.
 
✓ Planting and care: The best way to obtain chives is to divide a clump 
into groups of slender bulbs and plant in any well-drained garden soil. 
Chives prefer full sun but aren’t fussy. If you sow from seed, cover the 
seeds lightly with soil, keep the soil moist, and be patient; the seeds may 
take 2 to 3 weeks to sprout. Keep weeds away to make harvesting easier. 
Harvest by shearing the stems to within a few inches of the ground.

226
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Special uses: The pungent foliage reportedly repels some injurious 
pests, especially around roses, tomatoes, carrots, grapes, and apples. 
Puree the leaves in a blender with water, strain, and use as a spray to 
prevent powdery mildew. The flowers attract beneficial insects. Use 
chives in cooking as you would onions, or serve fresh in salads, dips, 
and sauces.
Coriander and cilantro
This annual herb (Coriandrum sativum) is so versatile that it bears two names — 
cilantro for the leaves and coriander for the seeds. The flat, parsleylike leaves 
add pungency to Latin American and Asian dishes. The seeds play a major 
role in curry and other Middle Eastern fare. Ancient Mediterranean peoples 
prescribed cilantro and coriander for many medical ailments.
 
✓ Planting and care: Sow directly in fertile garden soil, where seeds will 
sprout in a couple of weeks. Plant every 2 to 3 weeks for continuous 
harvest, because the plants tend to set seed quickly (especially in hot 
weather) and stop producing new foliage. Harvest young tender leaves 
before plants send up flower stalks. Harvest seeds when the seed heads 
turn brown but before they scatter, and dry thoroughly before using for 
best flavor.
 
✓ Special uses: Use leaves and seeds in cooking. Plant near aphid-prone 
crops to help repel pests. The flowers also attract beneficial insects.
Dill
Dill (Anethum graveolens) is another member of the aromatic carrot family. 
The seeds are an essential ingredient in pickles, breads, and other savory 
dishes. The fine, threadlike foliage is rich in vitamins and flavor for fish, 
sauces, and dips. The tall, narrow plants of this annual herb grow 2 to 3 feet 
tall. Choose the variety Bouquet for seeds, or grow Dukat or 18-inch-tall 
Fernleaf if you want mainly leaves.
 
✓ Planting and care: Sow seeds directly in fertile, sunny garden soil. 
Barely cover the seeds and sow again every few weeks for continuous 
harvest. Protect from strong winds.
 
✓ Special uses: The flowers attract beneficial insects, and the foliage is a 
favorite of swallowtail butterfly larvae. It reputedly makes a good com-
panion for cabbage crops and can be planted with low-growing lettuce 
and cucumbers. Use the seeds and leaves in cooking.

227
 Chapter 14: Herbs for the Home and Garden
Fennel
Useful in cooking and in the garden, 4- to 8-foot-tall fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) 
has a tropical look and resembles giant dill plants. Common fennel is hardy 
in Zones 6 through 11, but you can grow it as an annual in cooler climates. It 
self-sows and can become a nuisance weed. Try the bronze-red-leafed variety 
Purpureum as an ornamental plant. If you want to eat the root, look for the 
annual or biennial plant called finocchio or Florence fennel.
 
✓ Planting and care: Sow directly in fertile, sunny soil where you want it 
to grow. Its long taproot makes it difficult to transplant. Protect from 
strong wind.
 
✓ Special uses: You can use all parts of fennel, from the bulblike root to 
the leaves, stalks, and seeds. Harvest seeds when they turn brown; snip 
leaves and stems as needed, and use fresh or cooked lightly in soups 
and sauces. The flowers attract many beneficial insects.
Horseradish
Take care where you plant the tenacious perennial horseradish (Armoracia 
rusticana); its pungent roots extend 2 feet into the soil, and the smallest piece 
can sprout into a new plant. The wavy, 1- to 3-foot-long leaves are attrac-
tive, however, and small white flowers add to the plant’s appeal. It’s hardy 
through Zone 5.
Herbs for companion planting
The idea of growing certain plants in close prox-
imity for mutual benefit is well rooted in folklore 
and is gaining some ground in scientific circles. 
One way that plants help one another is by pro-
viding habitat for insects and other creatures 
that prey on damaging pests. Many herbs excel 
in this role because they have small, nectar-
rich flowers and aromatic leaves. Herbs in the 
carrot family (especially dill, caraway, tansy, 
fennel, and parsley) attract the following ben-
eficial insects:
 ✓ Lacewings
 ✓ Braconid wasps
 ✓ Aphid parasites
 ✓ Syrphid flies
 ✓ Spiders
 ✓ Mealybug and spider mite destroyers
 ✓ Trichogramma wasps
 ✓ Minute pirate bugs

228
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Planting and care: Plant the roots in deep fertile soil about 1 foot apart 
and 2 inches deep in full sun. To keep horseradish from taking over your 
garden, plant it in a bottomless trash can sunk into the ground. Wait a 
year or so before harvesting the roots in the fall.
 
✓ Special uses: The roots are sharply pungent and valued for the zip 
they give sauces and tomato drinks. The young spring leaves are edible 
when they’re cooked like spinach. Try a little horseradish to open your 
sinuses the next time you have a head cold. Some biodynamic farmers 
(see Chapter 2) believe that horseradish is beneficial in fruit orchards 
and around potatoes.
Lavender
One of the most recognized and popular scents for cosmetics, toiletries, and 
aromatherapy, lavender (Lavandula) also adds drama to your flower garden. 
Several species exist, all of which have needlelike foliage and spikes of pur-
plish blue flowers. The English lavender varieties, such as purple Hidcote 
and Munstead, grow up to 24 inches high and are hardy through Zone 5. Pink-
flowering varieties include Hidcote Pink and Miss Katherine. Other species 
are less hardy but equally appealing, including spike, French, and fringed 
lavenders.
 
✓ Planting and care: Start from stem cuttings, because seeds may not 
give you plants of uniform quality. Plant in compost-enriched, very well 
drained, even gravelly soil in full sun. Space plants 2 to 3 feet apart for 
a low hedge or mass planting. Prune in early spring to encourage bushy 
growth.
 
✓ Special uses: Harvest flowers as they begin to open, and dry them in 
bundles hung upside down in an airy place. The flowers attract bees and 
beneficial insects.
Mints
With 20 or so species and more than 1,000 varieties to choose from, you 
should find a mint (Mentha) to suit your taste. Peppermint and spearmint 
are the most popular, but fruit-flavored varieties also exist. Some plants have 
variegated foliage, including the pineapple mint Varieagata. Some mints, such 
as Corsican mint, creep along low to the ground; others grow 2 to 3 feet tall. 
Hardiness depends on the variety and species.

229
 Chapter 14: Herbs for the Home and Garden
 
✓ Planting and care: Start new plants from stem cuttings of the varieties 
you want, to make sure that you get the flavor or scent you expect. Plant 
just below the soil surface and keep the soil moist until the plants begin 
to grow. Mints can be invasive, so contain them or plant them where 
you don’t mind having a carpet of fragrant foliage.
 
✓ Special uses: Harvest the fresh leaves and add them to Middle Eastern 
dishes, soups, vegetables, and beverages. Mint flowers attract beneficial 
insects. Also, the fragrant plants reportedly repel some damaging insects 
and improve the health and flavor of nearby cabbages and tomatoes.
Oregano
Small fragrant leaves on sprawling 1- to 2-foot stems topped by loose spikes 
of white to pink flowers give oregano (Origanum vulgare) a casual appeal for 
planting in vegetable and flower gardens or trailing over a wall or basket. 
Many cooks prefer Greek oregano over the readily available common oreg-
ano. Before buying plants, pinch a leaf to test flavor and pungency. Some 
varieties, such as Aureum Crispum and Compactum, are more ornamental 
than edible. It’s a hardy perennial in Zone 5 and warmer areas.
 
✓ Planting and care: Start new plants from stem cuttings to guarantee the 
best flavor. Seed-grown plants may lack their parents’ pungent flavor. 
Any average, well-drained soil in full sun will do. Harvest leaves as 
needed, or cut the plant down to a few inches from the ground and hang 
the sprigs to dry.
 
✓ Special uses: The tiny flower clusters attract bees, butterflies, and other 
beneficial insects. The fresh and dried leaves add classic flavor to many 
Latin American and Mediterranean dishes. Some varieties look good in 
hanging baskets, patio containers, and flower gardens.
Parsley
A common garnish on restaurant plates, parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is 
probably the most recognized herb. The leaves contain loads of vitamins A 
and C, and help sweeten garlic breath. Although both varieties are edible, the 
flat-leafed variety has stronger flavor, whereas the curly-leafed kind is more 
commonly used as garnish.
The plants are biennial and hardy through Zone 5; they bloom only in their 
second year. The 1-foot-tall plants form tidy, bright green mounds of orna-
mental foliage. Plant in vegetable and flower gardens or in container gardens.

Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Planting and care: Soak seeds overnight before sowing, and plant 
directly in the garden. If you start seeds indoors, plant them in peat pots 
(biodegradable compressed peat moss containers) so that you don’t 
have to disturb their taproots when transplanting them later. Give the 
plants fertile garden soil and a cool, slightly shady spot in hot summer 
climates. Snip fresh leaves as needed, or cut the whole plant to a few 
inches high and dry the leaves on a screen.
 
✓ Special uses: Use for cooking, especially in Greek and Middle Eastern 
dishes. Parsley makes an attractive ornamental garden plant and serves 
as food for swallowtail butterfly larvae. The flowers attract beneficial 
insects.
Rosemary
Two types of this tender perennial evergreen shrub exist — upright and 
prostrate — and both are fragrant and edible. The short, needlelike foliage of 
Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) gives off a heady, distinctive aroma when 
lightly bruised. Ornamental varieties include those with golden or variegated 
leaves, pink or bright blue flowers, and especially sprawling or upright forms.
 
✓ Planting and care: Start from rooted stem cuttings, and plant in well-
drained garden soil. Rosemary doesn’t tolerate soggy soil or complete 
drought. Although the herb is hardy only to Zone 8, you can grow rose-
mary in a greenhouse or indoors under strong light. Plant it in a pot at 
least 1 foot deep to accommodate its taproot, and maintain humidity by 
setting it over moist pebbles or misting the plant a few times a week.
 
✓ Special uses: As an ornamental, rosemary excels in the low shrub 
border or trailing over a low wall. Its aromatic foliage is said to repel 
flying insects from cabbages and other vegetables. Use fresh sprigs in 
meat stews; use dried rosemary for culinary use or to scent rooms and 
linens.
Sage
In Zone 5 and warmer areas, sage (Salvia officinalis) is a perennial that grows 
into a shrubby mound of fragrant leaves. It can grow up to 2 feet tall. The 
2- to 3-inch-long leaves are fuzzy and oval, ranging in color from silver-green, 
purple, golden to mixed white, green, and pink, depending on the variety. 
Sage is equally at home in the herb garden and among the ornaments in a 
container or flower bed. In late spring, sage produces spikes of blue or white 
flowers.

231
 Chapter 14: Herbs for the Home and Garden
Several sage species exist, varying in hardiness, pungency, and size. One 
of my favorites, pineapple sage, is winter-hardy only to Zone 8, but its soft-
textured, pineapple-scented foliage and red flowers make a beautiful addition 
to my flower garden.
 
✓ Planting and care: It’s easier to start sage from stem cuttings, but sage 
can grow slowly from seeds. Plant in organically rich, well-drained 
garden soil, and give it full sun. Avoid soggy soil. Prune to keep the 
growth compact.
 
✓ Special uses: The spiky flowers attract bees and other beneficial insects, 
and look great in the garden. Use sage to scent dresser drawers and to 
help prevent damaging clothing moths. Use the leaves, either fresh or 
dried, in poultry and meat dishes.
Stevia
The incredibly sweet leaves of Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) can be used to 
sweeten a variety of foods and beverages.
 
✓ Planting and care: Hardy only to Zone 9, stevia is a tender perennial 
that you can grow as an annual or bring indoors in winter. The shrubby 
plants grow well in containers; you can snip off a leaf or two to chew on 
or drop into your tea.
 
✓ Special uses: To make stevia powder, remove the leaves; dry them in 
the sun; and grind them, using a mortar and pestle or an electric spice 
or coffee grinder. Use the powder to sweeten just about anything, but 
use it sparingly — it’s very potent.
Sweet marjoram
A tender perennial shrub in Zone 9 and warmer areas and a relative to oreg-
ano, sweet marjoram (Origanum majorana) has to be grown as an annual. 
It tends to sprawl and is best confined in a container or planted in a herb 
garden.
 
✓ Planting and care: Start from seed in late spring indoors, or buy rooted 
cuttings to be sure that you get the plant that you expect. The plant 
prefers full sun and fertile garden soil. Remove the flowers to encourage 
more leaves. Harvest and dry the leaves for year-round culinary use.
 
✓ Special uses: The light-purple flower clusters attract many beneficial 
insects. The leaves taste similar to oregano and are used extensively in 
cooking, especially in vegetable and egg dishes.

232
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Tarragon
A staple in French cooking, tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) is used to flavor 
a variety of foods, especially chicken, fish, and egg dishes. French tarragon — 
the preferred variety for cooking — can be propagated only from cuttings 
and divisions. If you see tarragon seeds, they’re likely Russian tarragon, a 
hardy but less flavorful plant.
 
✓ Planting and care: Plant tarragon in full sun and very well-drained soil, 
and water sparingly. Consider growing the herb in clay pots to ensure 
the excellent drainage it requires to thrive.
 
✓ Special uses: Use tarragon fresh or dried in just about any savory dish 
or sauce.
Thymes
Hundreds of thyme (Thymus) species and varieties are available, ranging 
from creeping 1-inch-high mats to 18-inch shrubs. All varieties have tiny oval 
leaves, in colors ranging from wooly gray to smooth green to golden to white-
edged. Even the fragrance varies from very mild to pungent, and includes 
lemon, caraway, and coconut.
Creeping thyme makes a fragrant, attractive ground cover and excels 
between paving stones; shrubby types make useful low hedges. Clusters of 
tiny white, pink, or crimson flowers bloom in summer, sometimes covering 
the plants. The creeping thymes are the hardiest kind and survive in Zone 4.
 
✓ Planting and care: Start with rooted stem cuttings to guarantee the 
flavor and appearance of your thyme. Plant in organically enriched, well-
drained soil in full sun. Divide the plants every few years, and keep them 
pruned to encourage dense growth.
 
✓ Special uses: The flowers attract bees and many beneficial insects. 
Much folklore exists on the use of thyme as a helpful companion plant 
for roses and vegetables. Use the herb between patio and walkway 
stones, or plant it as a ground cover to replace lawn in small areas. The 
trailing kinds look good in hanging baskets and planters. Harvest the 
leaves and young stems for cooking.

Picking from the Berry Patch
In This Chapter
▶ Planning where to plant
▶ Preparing the planting site
▶ Choosing the best fruits for your area
▶ Anticipating common pests and problems
F
ew plants give you more bang for your buck than berries. Homegrown 
raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and grapes take little space and 
return months of mouthwatering fruit salads, pies, pancakes, and fresh-eating 
goodness. Although less commonly grown, elderberries, currants, and some 
other small fruits make excellent landscape specimens, and turn out fruit fit 
for delicious jellies and other homemade treats. Because berries are perish-
able and the soft fruits are difficult to package and ship, supermarket berries 
are expensive and often past their prime. Also, conventionally grown grapes, 
raspberries, and strawberries are some of the most heavily sprayed food 
crops, making growing your own even more attractive.
Some of these berries are easy to grow organically; others present a real 
challenge. Choosing disease-resistant varieties, using the pest- and disease-
control methods described in Part III, and planting correctly go a long way 
toward producing healthful, pesticide-free berries.
Berry Patch Basics
Site selection and preparation are more critical for berries than for nearly 
any other food crop you may grow, because most of these plants stay in 
place for years. The varieties you choose, where you plant them, and how 
you prepare and maintain the soil determine whether your berry patch pro-
duces bumper crops or becomes a disappointing chore.

234
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
As you make decisions about where to plant your berry patch, keep the 
following requirements in mind:
 
✓ Sun: All fruits need at least six hours — preferably more — of full sun 
each day to produce large, flavorful crops.
 
✓ Air circulation and drainage: Moving air helps prevent disease organ-
isms from settling on vulnerable fruits and leaves, so choose a slightly 
breezy site, if possible. High winds cause damage, however, so protect 
crops with a windbreak if necessary.
 
 Cold air settles at the bottom of slopes, where it may damage early-
blooming flowers in the spring or ripening fruit in the fall. Plant your 
fruits on the slope of a hill instead of at the bottom.
 
✓ Soil moisture and drainage: With the exception of elderberries, all 
small fruits need well-drained soil. Soggy soil encourages root diseases, 
which are among the most serious problems for fruits. If your soil drains 
poorly, however, you can still grow fruits in raised beds. Make beds 6 to 
10 inches high and 4 feet wide, and amend with plenty of organic matter.
 
✓ Soil amendments and fertility: Fruiting plants need fertile, moist, richly 
organic soil to produce the best crops. Improve the soil with several 
inches of compost or composted manure, and add any needed pH 
amendments and nutrients before planting. See Chapter 5 for more on 
soils and drainage.
 
✓ Locally adapted varieties: Some plant varieties grow better in particular 
situations than other varieties. Check with your local extension office or 
nurseries in your area for recommendations, or ask around at farmers’ 
markets.
 
Plant your fruits close to the kitchen door, garage, or some other place that 
you visit daily. Frequent inspection helps you see potential pests and diseases 
before they become problems. Picking and maintenance feel like less of a 
chore, too, when the patch is just outside the door.
Weed control
Controlling weeds is more critical for small fruits than for nearly any other 
crop (except vegetables). Many fruits have shallow roots, which can’t com-
pete with more aggressive weeds for water and nutrients. Weeds also harbor 
insect pests that feed on your fruits. Perennial weeds often cause the most 
trouble because their roots persist from year to year and often sprout if even 
a small piece remains in the soil. Annual weeds come in the form of seeds 
blown by the wind or are carried by people, pets, birds, and rain.

235
 Chapter 15: Picking from the Berry Patch
Weeding a mature berry patch is a strenuous chore, because most of these 
plants have shallow roots that don’t allow cultivation or that grow in such a 
way that hand-pulling each weed is the only solution. Weeding thorny bram-
bles is an especially onerous job, so prevention is key. See Chapter 11 for 
information on controlling weeds.
Buying plants
It really pays to buy the best-quality plants that you can find. If you’re for-
tunate enough to have a local nursery that grows its own fruit plants, by all 
means pay it a visit. Local nurseries usually offer the best varieties for your 
area and can give you valuable advice on growing them in your particular 
situation.
In many parts of the country, however, specialty mail-order nurseries are 
often the best sources of virus-free, disease-resistant fruits. For more tips on 
buying plants, turn to Chapter 12.
 
A last piece of advice from someone who’s been there and done that: Don’t 
plant more than you have time to harvest and maintain. It’s easy to get excited 
about all the promising fruits you can grow and end up buying more plants 
than you need. Luckily, small fruits freeze very well, but you still have to weed 
and pick them.
Guide to Small Fruits
Growing berries is one of my most rewarding gardening activities. The season 
begins with strawberries. Then raspberries, blueberries, elderberries, and 
grapes ripen in succession through the summer and early fall. Pick your own 
favorites from this chapter, and get growing!
Beautiful blueberry
I’d be hard pressed to name a shrub that I like better than blueberry 
(Vaccinium species). As an ornamental plant, it offers small white flowers in 
spring, glossy green leaves in summer, and spectacular crimson foliage in 
fall. As an edible fruit, it can’t be beat for fresh eating, pies, pancakes, dessert 
sauce, and jam.

236
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Blueberries grow in Zones 3 to 10, but the species and best varieties vary 
from one extreme to the other. Choose one of these three species to suit your 
climate:
 
✓ Lowbush blueberry (V. angustifolium) is the hardiest for Zones 3 to 6. 
These 8- to 18-inch-tall plants form spreading mats and produce small, 
intensely flavored berries. Grow them as ground-covering landscape 
plants in well-drained acidic soil, and enjoy the fruits as a bonus or leave 
them for wildlife. Prune only to remove dead, damaged, or diseased 
plants. Varieties include Northsky and Putte.
 
✓ Highbush blueberry (V. corymbosum and hybrids) can grow from Zones 
4 to 10, but some varieties are better suited to either extreme. If you 
want plenty of large, flavorful, easy-to-pick fruit, choose highbush blue-
berries. Shrubs grow 2 to 6 feet tall and produce more fruit when you 
plant at least two different varieties. In the northern United States, try 
Bluecrop, Blueray, Earliblue, Northblue, Patriot, and Northland. In the 
South, plant Gulf Coast, Misty, O’Neill, and Reveille.
 
 Flower buds, which appear larger and rounder than leaf buds, form in 
the summer the year before the plants bloom and are most abundant 
on the 2- to 5-year-old woody stems, called canes. Prune in late winter to 
remove the oldest and most unproductive canes, leaving the most vigor-
ous 15 to 18 canes.
 
✓ Rabbiteye blueberry (V. ashei) grows in the warmer Zones 7 through 
9. Growing up to 10 feet tall, the varieties of this species have thicker-
skinned berries. You need to plant two different but compatible variet-
ies to get fruit. Good companions include Beckyblue and Bonitablue or 
Powderblue and Tifblue.
 
Blueberries belong to a group of plants that have very specific soil needs, 
including lots of decomposed organic matter and an acidic pH of 4.5 to 5.2. 
They grow where azaleas and rhododendrons naturally thrive, but you can 
also alter your soil with acidifying peat moss and sulfur to accommodate 
their needs. It takes at least 6 months to a year or more for amendments to 
significantly lower soil pH, so plan ahead, and test the soil before planting. See 
Chapter 5 for more on soil amendments and pH.
All blueberries have shallow roots and need moist, well-drained soil. Mix 1/2 
cubic foot of peat moss per plant into the soil at planting time. Cover the soil 
around the shrubs with organic mulch — such as pine needles, shredded 
oak leaves, or hardwood bark — to maintain the soil moisture and prevent 
weeds. Keep the soil moist throughout the growing season. Avoid deep culti-
vation, which can damage the shrubs’ roots.

237
 Chapter 15: Picking from the Berry Patch
 
Blueberries have relatively few serious pests or diseases, but good sanitation 
practices are a must. Mummy berry fungus causes trouble in some areas, 
spreading from fallen fruit. You can prevent other fungus diseases by pruning, 
to encourage air circulation through the plants, and by keeping the foliage dry. 
Birds are the most serious pests; cover the plants completely with bird netting 
before the berries turn blue.
Ramblin’ brambles
If you love fresh raspberries or blackberries, you’ll be glad to know how easy 
they are to grow. These delicate and perishable fruits are expensive in the 
market, but you can plant your own small patch and produce enough for 
fresh eating and freezing, too.
 
When planning your patch of brambles (as these fruits are known), thoroughly 
follow the instructions in the “Berry Patch Basics” section earlier in this chap-
ter. Pay special attention to air circulation and soil drainage: Raised beds work 
well with brambles; be sure to allow at least 8 feet between rows of plants. 
Taking weed-control precautions before you plant is also important, because 
most brambles sport hooked thorns, which make weeding the mature plants 
difficult, and shallow roots that are easily damaged by hoes.
 
Don’t plant where other brambles or potatoes, tomatoes, or eggplants have 
grown in recent years due to risk of verticillium root disease infection. It’s also 
best to eliminate nearby wild brambles, if possible, because they often spread 
disease.
Brambles range in growth habit from upright to sprawling. Some stand up on 
their own, but most need trellis supports to keep the fruiting canes off the 
ground. A typical arrangement consists of a T-shaped post and crosspiece at 
either end of the row, with taut wires or heavy twine running between them 
down the length of the row. Trailing varieties of blackberry can also be tied 
to a wire fence or another type of flat support.
Shoots called canes grow from either the roots or crown of the plant. 
Bramble canes are biennial, which means that plants flower on second-year 
canes, which subsequently die. Canes are called primocanes the first year 
they sprout and floricanes in their second year. Floricanes die after fruiting 
and should be pruned out. Most raspberries and blackberries produce fruit 
only on the floricanes, but some raspberry varieties — often referred to as 
everbearing — also produce on primocanes in the fall.
Depending on your preference and climate, you can choose among several 
bramble types and many different varieties for your garden.

238
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
Some diseases cause serious damage to raspberries and blackberries, leading 
to their decline and reduced fruiting. Root rot, verticillium wilt, and leaf rust 
are among the worst, but some varieties are less susceptible than others to 
disease. Whenever possible, choose a resistant variety.
Red raspberries
This delicate fruit grows best in cool climates, where plants will receive the 
800 to 1,800 hours of chilling they need to produce fruit (see Chapter 16). Most 
varieties bear one crop per year; others produce two. Summer-bearing variet-
ies produce fruit in the summer on floricanes. Everbearing types fruit in the 
summer on floricanes and again in the fall on new primocanes. Although most 
raspberries produce red berries, some varieties have yellow or purple fruit.
Prune summer-bearing raspberries twice a year. After summer fruiting, 
remove all the floricanes. In early spring, prune out winter-damaged and 
weak canes, leaving about three to four vigorous canes per square foot, or 
roughly 6 to 9 inches between canes. Cut these remaining canes back to 
about 3 to 4 feet high (see Figure 15-1). You can treat the everbearing types 
similarly or prune all the canes to the ground in late autumn or early spring. 
This severe pruning forfeits the summer crop but yields a bumper crop in 
autumn.
Summer-bearing red varieties include Latham, Boyne, Killarney, Milton, 
September, Canby (nearly thornless), and Nordic. Everbearing varieties 
include Heritage, Autumn Bliss, and Indian Summer. Yellow varieties include 
Fall Gold, Amber, and Honeyqueen. Purple varieties share red and black rasp-
berry parentage and may resemble either one. Royalty is the most common 
variety.
Black and purple raspberries
Black raspberries, also called black caps, have a rich flavor and lack the core 
that characterizes blackberries. Plants grow new primocanes from the crown 
instead of from the roots; they’re easier to contain within a row because they 
don’t grow shoots several feet from the mother plant, as red raspberries do. 
Plant black raspberry plants 3 feet apart in raised hills.
To control their length and encourage lateral branches (side shoots) to form, 
prune 3 to 4 inches off the primocane tips when they reach 24 to 30 inches 
high in midsummer. The following spring, prune the lateral branches to about 
6 to 10 inches long. At that time, also remove all but the strongest four to six 
canes. Black raspberry varieties include Black Hawk, Mac Black, Bristol, and 
Jewel.
Purple raspberries result from crosses between red and black raspberry vari-
eties, but they are much less commonly grown. Their growth habit is similar 
to that of black raspberries, and the fruit is excellent for jams. Royalty is the 
most common variety.

 Chapter 15: Picking from the Berry Patch

prune rasp-
berry canes

fruit.
 
Blackberries
Preferring hot southern summers, blackberries grow in Zones 6 and warmer, 
although some varieties make it into Zone 5 and warmer parts of Zone 4. 
Prune blackberries as described for summer-bearing raspberries, but leave 
the floricanes about 4 to 5 feet high.
Blackberries fall into two main categories: bush (or upright) and trailing. 
The trailing varieties make less appealing plants for most home gardeners 
because they require more trellising and maintenance, have more thorns 
than the uprights, and are less cold-hardy. Thornless blackberries are now 
available, including Arapaho, Black Satin, Chester, Navaho, Hull, and Triple 
Crown. Of the thorny upright varieties, Illini Hardy, Darrow, Lowden, and 
Ebony King are among the cold hardiest.
Keeping current with currants 
and gooseberries
A mainstay in European gardens and gaining popularity in North America, 
currants and gooseberries (Ribes species) make excellent jams, jellies, and 
dessert berries. The U.S. government at one time banned growing this group 
of ornamental and delicious fruits, because Ribes species contribute to a 
deadly white pine disease called white pine blister rust. Several states still 
restrict the sale and transport of Ribes, although disease-resistant varieties, 
which eliminate the problem, are now available.
Use currents and gooseberries as ornamental landscape shrubs. They bear 
attractive flowers and fruit, have maple-shaped leaves, and remain 3 to 4 
feet high. Gooseberries do have thorns, however, so choose their planting 

240
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
locations carefully. Plant the plants 3 to 4 feet apart in fertile, well-drained, 
compost-enriched soil with a pH of 6 to 7. Full sun to light shade is best. Most 
plants in this group are hardy to Zone 3, but spring frost may damage the 
early flowers. In very cold regions, plant on the north side of a building or 
other location that warms slowly in the spring to delay bloom. Gooseberries’ 
high chill requirement (see Chapter 16) makes them unsuitable for climates 
with warm or very short winters and hot summers.
The most commonly grown Ribes fall into two major groups:
 
✓ Currants don’t have spines and bear 3/8-inch fruit in clusters, called 
strigs, that look like miniature bunches of grapes. Red and white cur-
rants have a mild flavor, whereas black currants have a stronger taste. 
Disease-resistant red currants include Red Lake and Redstart. The most 
disease-resistant black currants are Consort and Crandall.
 
✓ Gooseberries have a spine at the base of each leaf. The fruit is larger 
than that of currants, varies in color from greenish white to red, and is 
borne singly or in small clusters. Popular varieties include Hinnonmaki 
Red, Invicta, and Poorman.
 
✓ Jostaberries have black currant and gooseberry parentage and have red 
or black fruits that are larger than currants. The plants are vigorous and 
generally pest-free.
Currants, gooseberries, and jostaberries can pollinate themselves and don’t 
need another variety to produce fruit. Prune the shrubs in late winter, and 
remove only canes older than 3 years. Thin younger canes, if necessary, to 
prevent crowding.
Elegant elderberry
This underused shrub (Sambucus canadensis) is native to eastern North 
America. It has few serious pests or diseases, thrives in poorly drained 
soil, lives in Zones 3 to 9, and produces clusters of Vitamin C–rich fruit. If 
groomed to remove dead wood and wayward shoots, elderberry makes an 
attractive small landscape tree or large shrub, which grows up to 8 feet tall 
and 8 to 12 feet wide. Elderberries tend to send up new shoots from the roots 
and create thickets, but individual stems usually live for only a few years. 
Prune these stems out when they become unproductive.
Elderberries bloom in the late spring, producing 8- to 12-inch-wide, flat-topped 
clusters of flowers that nearly cover the plant. Elderflowers are used to make 
wine and a delicate liquor. You can also dip them in batter and fry them into 
fritters. The dark purple berries ripen in late summer. You can eat the berries 

241
 Chapter 15: Picking from the Berry Patch
raw, but they contain large seeds. I boil and strain the berries to collect the 
juice for jelly. Mixed with apple juice, they make a beautiful, clear, deep pink 
to wine-colored jelly. The St. Lawrence Nurseries (see Chapter 16) catalog 
suggests boiling a pint of juice with 21/2 cups of sugar and 10 whole cloves, 
and serving it over ice for stomach ailments and colds. I mix a similar concoc-
tion with sparkling water for a natural soft drink. Elderberry wine is another 
possibility, of course.
Plant elderberries in moist soil and full sun. For best fruiting, plant two dif-
ferent varieties or seedlings. Wild seedlings are adequate for my garden, but 
several good improved varieties exist, with larger and more numerous ber-
ries. These varieties include Kent, York, Nova, and Johns.
Going ape for grapes
Growing organic grapes (Vitis species) successfully depends on your climate, 
cultural strategies, and the varieties you choose. Arid climates provoke 
fewer diseases than humid climates. You can grow grapes nearly anywhere 
in Zones 3 through 10, and they tolerate a wide range of soil conditions; well-
drained soil in the pH range of 5.5 to 7.0 is best. Grapes need full sun and 
very good air circulation to hamper diseases.
At least three grape species and countless varieties exist in North American 
gardens and vineyards. The European grape (V. vinifera) grows best in a 
Mediterranean climate, such as California and parts of the southwestern 
United States. In hotter, humid climates, many people grow muscadine 
grapes (V. rotundifolia), which thrive in Zones 7 through 9. The native North 
American species (V. labrusca) and its hybrids are the hardiest and best for 
most other regions of the country.
To sort out the complicated lineage, divide grapes into two broad categories: 
table grapes and wine or juice grapes. Table grapes have tender skins suit-
able for fresh eating and may contain seeds or be seedless. Wine and juice 
grapes may have tougher skins but plenty of sweet juice for liquid consump-
tion or making into jelly. Ripe fruit colors range from green to pink and red to 
deep purplish black.
Before planting young grapes, prepare the soil thoroughly as described in 
the “Berry Patch Basics” section, earlier in this chapter. Install a sturdy trel-
lis consisting of two or three heavy wires strung 24 inches apart on sturdy 
posts. Brace the end posts.
Several pruning and training systems exist, but the basic idea in all of them 
is to establish one or two main trunks per vine. Each trunk grows horizontal 
lateral branches, as described for kiwi (see the following section), which you 

242
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
attach to the wires. The flowers and fruit appear on wood that grows in the 
current year from the laterals that grew in the previous year. Starting in winter 
after the first growing season, begin the pruning and training as follows:
 
1. In the first winter, choose two healthy, vigorous canes to keep, and 
remove the rest.
 
 Prune these main trunks back to three or four buds each.
 
2. The next summer, select the most vigorous shoot from each trunk, and 
remove competing shoots.
 
 Train the shoots on a string until they reach the top wire; then pinch 
them to encourage lateral branching, as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
3. In the second winter, remove all growth from the trunk and lateral 
branches.
 
 Cut laterals back to ten buds. Let vines grow unpruned through the 
summer.
 
4. In the third winter and subsequent years, choose the laterals for the 
current year, as well as replacement laterals for the next year.
 
 Leave ten buds on the current-year laterals and two buds on the replace-
ments. (Remember that grapes grow fruit on wood that grows in the cur-
rent year from last season’s laterals.) Prune off all other wood, removing 
as much 90 percent of the previous year’s growth.
Prevalent diseases and pests include berry moth, mites, leafhoppers, and 
Japanese beetles, as well as Botrytis bunch rot, powdery mildew, and black 
rot. Some varieties are less sensitive to infection than other varieties.

 Chapter 15: Picking from the Berry Patch
Grape varieties often grow best in specific regions of the country. Consult 
your local extension office or reputable nursery for recommendations. Also 
take a look at the “Surfing for small fruits” sidebar in this chapter.
Have a hardy kiwi, mate?
Unless you happen to live in Zone 8 or warmer, you can forget about growing 
the subtropical kiwis that appear in grocery stores. Luckily, if you live in a cli-
mate as cold as Zone 5 and even Zone 4, you can grow hardy kiwis. The hardy 
species, Actinidia arguta, produces very sweet, smooth-skinned, green fruit 
about the size of a large cherry, which ripens in late summer to early fall. You 
can eat these kiwis skin and all, and many people consider them more flavor-
ful than the less hardy, store-bought kiwifruit. Male and female flowers occur 
on separate plants, so you need one male plant for every five female plants. 
The sweetly fragrant ornamental flowers smell like lily of the valley.
The hardy kiwi plant is a very vigorous vine that can grow 20 feet or more 
long and requires a strong trellis. A mature, properly pruned kiwi vine can 
produce more than 100 pounds of fruit per year. To make a trellis, set 4- to 
6-inch diameter, 8- to 9-foot high posts at least 2 to 3 feet into the ground, and 
run heavy-gauge wire between them 6 feet off the ground. Train the vines up 
the posts and along the wire. Avoid planting where strong wind may damage 
the vines or blow down the trellis.
Space plants about 15 feet apart in full sun. Soil must have a pH around 6.5 
and be well drained but moist, especially as new plants become established 
and while fruit develops. Root rot is common in overly wet soil. Mulch to sup-
press weeds and maintain soil moisture. Plants produce flowers and fruit on 
shoots that grow in the current spring.
Pruning is critical to control rampant growth and encourage maximum fruiting:
 
✓ Summer pruning: Establish one to four main trunks, using more in 
colder climates and fewer where cold damage is less likely. Train these 
trunks up the center post, and prune to 6-foot lengths when they reach 
the top to encourage them to sprout lateral shoots along the wires. 
These lateral shoots become the permanent arms from which fruiting 
wood will grow. In the summer, as the laterals branch, prune off 4 inches 
of new growth whenever the shoots reach 8 inches in length. The result 
should be a series of 4-inch sections of vine, called spurs, that will send 
out fruiting wood the following spring.
 
✓ Winter pruning: In late winter, remove fruiting wood older than three 
years, as well as very tangled or twisted vines. Shorten any vines that 
may reach the ground when growth resumes, but avoid cutting the 
spurs or arms.

Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Harvest the fruit in late summer when it softens and becomes sweet. (You 
may have to beat the squirrels to the harvest.) You can store kiwifruit in the 
refrigerator for a short time.
Sublime strawberries
Probably the most popular small fruits for the home garden, strawberries are 
also among the hardest to grow organically. Strawberries have many insect 
pests and diseases that damage plants and berries alike. Establishing your 
planting in well-drained, fertile soil and maintaining a weed-free patch are 
essential for success.
You can choose among three kinds of strawberries, depending on when you 
want fruit. Consult your local extension office or nurseries for the best varieties 
for your area. Also see the “Surfing for small fruits” sidebar in this chapter.
 
✓ June-bearing varieties produce one large crop of berries in late spring 
to early summer.
 
✓ Everbearing varieties produce two smaller crops: one in early summer 
and another in early fall.
 
✓ Day-neutral berries, the newest type, can produce fruit continuously 
throughout the growing season.
Strawberry planting and growing guide
Plant dormant, bare-root strawberry plants 18 to 24 inches apart in 3- to 
6-inch-high, 3- to 4-foot-wide raised beds. Set the plants so that soil covers 
the roots but the crown remains above the soil, as shown in Figure 15-3. Keep 
the soil moist but not saturated. Pinch off all flowers until midsummer for the 
first season to encourage strong root and top growth.
The plants that you set out are called the mother plants. They send out run-
ners that take root and develop new daughter plants in mid- to late summer. 
Space the daughter plants evenly around the mothers to give each plant 
plenty of space to grow. Daughter plants flower and fruit the year after they 
grow. In the second summer, you can remove the original mother plants 
to make room for new daughter plants. Another method is to rotary-till the 
sides of the bed in midsummer of the second or third year, leaving plants 
only in the 18- to 24-inch-wide center strip. Train new daughter plants into 
the tilled soil.
Plan to replace your strawberry planting every three to five years. Cover the 
planting with straw mulch after the ground freezes in cold-winter climates, 
and remove the mulch as the weather warms in spring.

Diseases and insect pests that prey on strawberries
 
One of the most serious insect pests that affect strawberries is the tarnished 
plant bug, which can severely damage the developing fruit. These insects 
spend the winter in plant debris and live on weeds in and around your yard. 
Covering the strawberry plants in the fall with a floating row cover can offer 
some, but not complete, protection from the bugs in the following spring and 
early summer. Early-ripening varieties often suffer less damage than late-
season berries.
The strawberry clipper or bud weevil is another significant pest in some 
areas. These insects fly into the planting from neighboring woodlots and 
hedgerows about the time that the flower buds swell. Adults destroy the 
developing buds by laying eggs in them. Many other insects, slugs, mites, 
and nematodes attack strawberry fruits and plants, reducing vigor and pro-
duction, and introducing disease. Birds and ground squirrels also take their 
share.
Strawberries are subject to many fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases. Fungal 
infections include leaf spot, leaf scorch, leaf blight, powdery mildew, red 
stele, verticillium wilt, root rot, and several berry rots. Buy only virus-free 
plants from a reputable nursery, and avoid planting strawberries where 
tomatoes, eggplants, or potatoes previously grew to prevent wilt diseases. 
See Part III for more control strategies.

Surfing for small fruits
The Internet offers a wealth of information 
about any topic that you care to know about 
(and some topics that you don’t), and small 
fruits are no exception. Government- and 
university-sponsored sites feature advice and 
instructions, as well as links to other related

Organic Orchard

▶ Choosing disease-resistant varieties
F
reshly picked fruit from your own trees and shrubs is juicy joy — and 
easier to grow than you may think. Sure, some fruit and nut trees need 
more attention than many other plants, but the harvest is worth the effort. 
Many fruit varieties that you can grow at home taste far better than super-
market fruit. While better flavor is reason enough to grow your own fruit, 
if you’re concerned about pesticides, you have another compelling reason: 
Cherries, peaches, apples, and apricots are among the 12 most pesticide-
contaminated foods, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Even if you have nothing more than a large patio planter, you can grow your 
own fruit; on a half-acre lot, you can plant an orchard large enough to pro-
vide fruit for yourself and half the neighborhood. As a bonus, most fruit trees 
and shrubs are ornamental, especially when they’re blooming.
Anatomy of a Fruit Tree
Fruit and nut trees resemble other trees in most ways but differ in one 
important aspect: Unlike ornamental plants, fruit trees are grown primarily 
to produce food. To make these fruit factories more and more efficient, plant 
breeders continue to develop special techniques, such as reducing the size 
of the trees, to make trees produce at an earlier age and yield more fruit per 
acre. That’s good news for home gardeners.

248
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Size does matter
Trees are easier to harvest and maintain when all the branches are within 
arm’s reach. Unfortunately, many fruit trees can grow up to 40 feet tall or 
even higher when left to their own devices. To keep them in bounds and 
to produce more high-quality fruit, most fruit varieties and many nuts are 
grafted onto the roots of smaller-growing varieties.
Some rootstocks influence the size that the tree will ultimately attain, 
although the mature size of the tree also depends on the standard height 
that’s normal for the variety of fruit that’s been grafted onto the rootstock. 
Dwarfing rootstocks are categorized by the amount of dwarfing they provide. 
Apple-tree sizes, for example, fall into several categories:
 
✓ Standard-size apple trees, grown on seedling or nondwarfing roots, may 
reach 25 feet.
 
✓ Semidwarf trees are about 75 percent of the standard height, or about 
18 feet at maturity.
 
✓ Dwarf trees are about 50 percent as high as standard trees, or 
12 feet tall.
 
✓ Miniature trees are only about 15 percent of the standard size. At a 
mere 4 feet in height, these trees are the best kind for growing in 
containers.
 
As an organic home gardener, consider dwarf to semidwarf trees. It’s easier 
to monitor and control pests when you can reach the top of the tree. On very 
small trees, you can even use a barrier fabric to help prevent insect infesta-
tions (see Chapter 8). You can also harvest fruit years sooner and pick the 
fruit more easily.
Sex and the single tree
Many fruit and nut species — such as apples, sweet cherries, European pears, 
Japanese plums, walnuts, pecans, and filberts — require cross-pollination to 
bear fruit. That means that you need two different but compatible varieties 
planted near each other so that the pollen of one species fertilizes the flowers 
of the other.
The trees must bloom at the same time for cross-pollination to occur, and 
some varieties are fussy about the trees with which they mix. Other fruit and 
nut species are self-fruitful, which means that they can pollinate their own 
flowers, but even those species often produce larger crops when they mix 
pollen with a friend. Reputable nurseries can tell you which varieties can pol-
linate each other. See the “Where to find fruits and nuts” sidebar, later in this 
chapter.

249
 Chapter 16: Fruits and Nuts for Your Organic Orchard
Chill out
Fruits and nuts have another peculiar requirement. Most need a certain 
number of hours below 45 degrees Fahrenheit — their chill requirement or 
chill factor — to produce lots of flowers and fruit. As you may guess, fruits 
(such as oranges) that grow mostly in warm climates have lower chilling 
requirements than some cold-climate fruits (like apples). The chill factor is 
not related to cold-hardiness, however. Even some frost-tender plants, such 
as fig trees, need some time below 45 degrees Fahrenheit to bear fruit prop-
erly. Table 16-1 lists the chill categories.
 
Look for specific varieties that match your climate. Some peach varieties need 
only 200 hours; others require more than 1,000.

Low winter temperatures and the timing of autumn and spring frosts play 
important roles in your selection of fruit species and varieties for your organic 
orchard. Local nurseries generally sell plants that are best suited to your local 
climate. Reputable mail-order nurseries and your local extension office can 
also steer you toward appropriate varieties.
Budding genius
Fruit trees grow different kinds of buds, and it helps to be able to recognize 
the various types. The terminal bud grows at the end of branches, and that’s 
where new branches and twigs grow from each spring. When the termi-
nal buds expand, they leave bud scars, which look like slightly raised rings 
around the twig. You can measure how much a tree has grown each year 
by looking at the distance between bud scars. Leaf buds appear along the 
twigs and expand into leaves. Flower buds are usually fatter than leaf buds 
and swell first in the spring. Some trees — such as most apple, pear, cherry, 
plum, and apricot trees — produce their fruit on spurs, which are short, mod-
ified twigs. Spurs usually live and produce flower buds for several years or 
longer before becoming unproductive. See Figure 16-1 for examples of these 
bud types.

250
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
For the best-quality apples and pears, leave only one fruit on each spur, and 
pinch off the others in early summer. Spurs and flower buds develop best on 
limbs that are angled slightly above horizontal. Branches that grow upright 
and those that dangle below horizontal produce little, if any, fruit.

The whys and wherefores of grafting
Tree nurseries slip a bud, called a scion, from a 
desirable fruit variety, such as Delicious apple 
or Bing cherry, under the bark of a dwarf-
ing rootstock variety in early spring. The two 
grow together, and when the scion bud starts 
growing vigorously, the nursery prunes off the 
dwarfing rootstock’s top growth to just above 
the bud. The place where the two parts meet is 
called the bud union, which usually shows up 
as a bulge, bend, or scar.
Plant breeders and tree nurseries graft fruit and 
nut trees for a variety of reasons:
 ✓ Reproduce exact copies of desirable trees: 
Nurseries can make as many trees as they 
need by grafting buds of a desirable variety 
onto uniform rootstocks.
 ✓ Influence the mature size of the tree: 
Reducing the tree size has many advan-
tages, especially for home gardeners.
 ✓ Encourage fruit bearing at an earlier age: 
Some standard-size apple trees can take up 
to ten years to begin bearing fruit, whereas 
a dwarf bears fruit in two years.
 ✓ Increase disease and pest resistance: 
Some rootstocks resist soil-borne diseases 
and harmful pests better than others.
 ✓ Adapt to different soils: Some trees grow 
better in clay soils; others prefer loam.
 ✓ Determine hardiness to particular climates: 
Roots are among the most cold-sensitive 
parts of a tree. Some rootstocks increase 
the trees’ hardiness to cold temperatures.

251
 Chapter 16: Fruits and Nuts for Your Organic Orchard
Cultural Exchange
Choosing the best kinds of fruit and nut plants for your climate is only one 
part of establishing a successful, low-maintenance organic orchard. You also 
have to plant your trees and shrubs where they can thrive, give them the fer-
tile soil they need, prune them for health and maximum production, and plan 
your strategies for dealing with the inevitable pests and diseases.
Planting for success
All fruits need moisture-retentive but well-drained soil. (Flip to Chapter 5 for 
more on soil testing and drainage.) Soggy sites spell doom for these species. 
Adequate water is also critical, especially when the fruit is developing and 
expanding.
Professional fruit growers also consider air movement when they plan their 
orchard placement and layout. Air affects fruit and nut plants in several ways:
 
✓ Wind: Too much wind can keep pollinating insects, such as bees, from 
flying and pollinating the flowers at critical times. It also knocks fruit off 
the tree and can damage the branches. Plant a windbreak if necessary, 
or put the trees where a building shields them.
 
✓ Frost pockets: Cold air flows downhill and collects at the bottom of a 
slope. Trees that bloom in early spring are especially vulnerable to cold 
temperatures at that time, and the flowers may be severely damaged if 
they’re planted where cold air collects. Plant fruit trees and shrubs on 
the slope instead of near the bottom, but avoid the windy top of a slope.
 
✓ Circulation: Constantly but lightly moving air helps prevent disease 
organisms from getting a foothold on your trees. Many fungus diseases 
that infect leaves need water and moisture to spread and grow, so keep-
ing the leaves dry is important.
 
If you buy your plants locally, they usually are already growing in a container. 
If you order them from a mail-order nursery, however, they arrive in a dormant 
(nongrowing) state and bare root — without any soil around their roots. Be 
sure to plant bare-root trees and shrubs right away. Refer to Chapter 12 for 
information on how to plant container-grown and bare-root plants.
 
After planting, establish a wide ring of organic mulch around your trees to 
conserve soil moisture, prevent grass and weeds from competing with the tree 
roots, and reduce insect pests. See Chapter 11 for the lowdown on mulch and 
its benefits.

252
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Because producing heavy crops of fruit stresses trees and shrubs, fruit- and 
nut-bearing species may need additional nutrients. See Chapter 5 for details 
on soil testing and Chapter 6 for more on fertilizers.
Pruning fruit trees
Producing bushels of high-quality fruit and developing a sturdy tree that can 
support the crop are the twin goals of pruning and training fruit trees. If you 
end up with an attractive landscape specimen too, that’s a bonus! Although 
you use the same basic pruning techniques on all fruit trees, each kind of 
fruit tree has unique timing and methods for reaching your goals. For an 
introduction to basic pruning techniques and tools, flip to Chapter 19.
You need to prune fruit trees regularly for several reasons:
 
✓ To remove dead, damaged, and diseased wood: Do this before any 
other pruning and whenever necessary.
 
✓ To control tree and shrub size: Keep fruit down where you can harvest 
and care for it without a ladder.
 
✓ To provide air circulation: Circulation helps ward off pests and dis-
eases. Crowded limbs invite fungus diseases and provide habitat for 
damaging insects.
 
✓ To increase exposure to sunlight: Fruit that’s exposed to direct sunlight 
tastes better than fruit shaded by leaves and branches.
 
✓ To increase the quality and quantity of fruit: Branches trained to 
60-degree angles where they meet the trunk develop the most flower 
buds. Spacing the limbs up and down and around the trunk provides the 
best conditions for the fruit to mature.
Professional fruit growers use several pruning and training methods, depend-
ing on the type of fruit they grow (see Figure 16-2):
 
✓ Central leader: Used mainly with apple, European pear and plum trees, 
large nut trees, and dwarf cultivars, this method yields trees with single, 
upright trunks, called central leaders. The main limbs should be spaced 
about 8 inches apart and extend in all directions around the trunk so 
that no limb is directly above another. To maximize sunlight penetra-
tion, prune the limbs so that those at the top of the tree are shorter than 
branches under them.
 
✓ Modified central leader: In this system, trees are trained to a single, 
upright central leader, with limbs evenly spaced until they reach a 
desired height — usually, 6 to 10 feet. At that point, you prune out the 
leader and maintain the tree at that height. All fruit trees can be trained 
to this form.

253
 Chapter 16: Fruits and Nuts for Your Organic Orchard
 
✓ Open center (also called vase shape): Peaches, nectarines, sour cher-
ries, apricots, Asian pears, and Japanese plums produce easy-to-reach, 
high-quality fruit when the trees are pruned to this form. In this style, 
you select four or five well-placed main branches and then prune out the 
central leader. This method limits the height of the tree and creates a 
spreading crown.
Note: These styles apply mainly to temperate-climate fruit; tropical fruits, 
such as citrus, are trained differently.

Choose young fruit trees with good structure to start with and shape them as 
they grow. Here’s how to get your trees off to a good start:
 
✓ At planting time: Remove damaged and dead limbs, those less than 
25 inches from the ground, and any with narrow crotch angles of less 
than 45 degrees. Leave branches with crotch angles between 45 and 80 
degrees. If the tree has two shoots competing to be the leader, choose 
one and remove the other.
 
✓ First winter: In late winter, select three to four limbs to keep as main 
branches. They should be about 8 inches apart vertically, be well spaced 
around the trunk, and have approximately 60-degree angles at the trunk. 
Prune off all other limbs. Prune the remaining limbs back by one third 
of their length to encourage side branching. Prune the central leader to 
24 to 30 inches above the uppermost limb for a central-leader-style tree. 
If you’re pruning for an open center or vase shape, remove the central 
leader just above the top branch.

254
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Second summer: In midsummer, remove water sprouts, which grow 
upright from the branches, and suckers, which grow up from the base 
of the tree. In central-leader trees, choose the strongest, most upright 
leader; then remove the competing ones. Using the criteria mentioned 
for the first dormant season, choose the next tier of limbs, begin-
ning about 15 to 18 inches above the top branch of the lower tier, and 
remove undesirable limbs. In open-center trees, remove competing, 
crowded, and upright shoots.
 
✓ Second winter: Remove undesirable limbs, competing leaders, water 
sprouts, and suckers, and prune the new growth of side branches back 
by one third. Use notched sticks called spreaders to spread the remain-
ing limbs to 60-degree angles where they meet the trunk. Leave the 
spreaders in place until mid- to late summer. In open-center trees, prune 
new shoots by one third to outward-facing buds — buds that face away 
from the trunk — to encourage branching. Thin out crowded shoots by 
removing the weakest ones. See the “Where to find fruits and nuts” side-
bar for sources of spreaders; many nurseries offer them.
 
✓ Continuing care: Continue to follow the directions for the second 
season year after year. To develop a modified central-leader tree, 
remove the central leader just above the uppermost branch you want to 
keep. Do this job in the summer to inhibit vigorous sprouting.
Preventing pests and diseases
Humans aren’t the only beings who love fruit; insects, diseases, and other 
creatures appreciate these trees and shrubs too. Some insects damage the 
fruits; others concentrate their efforts on the foliage and wood. Insects take 
a toll, but you can control many of them without resorting to pesticides.
Sticky traps, baited either to resemble a ripe red apple or with hormones 
that the bugs find sexy, capture many codling moths, apple maggots, borers, 
and some scale and leaf-miner species. White and yellow plastic rectangles 
covered with sticky glue also attract several species of harmful insects. 
Horticultural oil sprays can control aphids, pear psyllas, mites, leaf miners, 
and caterpillars. Other insects can be trickier to deal with, but luckily, you 
can fool many pests with traps and barriers and, if necessary, well-timed 
organic pesticide sprays. See Chapter 8 for more information on organic con-
trols and purchasing sources.
 
Plant breeders have developed many modern fruit varieties that resist or 
at least tolerate some of the most devastating diseases. And some old-time 
varieties are naturally resistant to certain pests. Learn what pests pose the 
biggest problems in your region and choose varieties that resist them.

255
 Chapter 16: Fruits and Nuts for Your Organic Orchard
Temperate-Climate Trees and Shrubs
Popular and easy to grow in U.S. Department of Agriculture Hardiness Zones 
8 and northward, these fruits find their way into lunch boxes, fruit salads, 
and pies from coast to coast. All require some dedication to their cultural 
needs but richly reward your efforts.
Apples
Apples (Malus sylvestris) are among the most popular fruit trees to grow, 
but to harvest high-quality fruit, you must be prepared to regularly prune, 
feed, and deal with pests. Apples require cross-pollination; you can also use 
ornamental crabapples to pollinate apple trees. When choosing an apple-tree 
variety, consider these factors:
 
✓ Ripening time: Apples ripen from late summer through late autumn, 
so choose a variety that ripens its fruit before freezing temperatures in 
your area have a chance to damage the crop. Varieties also vary con-
siderably in their chill requirements. Take a look at the “Where to find 
fruits and nuts” sidebar, later in this chapter, for sources of trees that 
are best suited for your area.
 
✓ Size: As trees increase in size, they become harder to prune and spray, 
so choose trees on semidwarf and dwarf rootstocks that reach only 8 to 
12 feet tall. You can also use pruning techniques to control tree height. 
Prune apple trees in late winter, while they are dormant, and follow up 
in midsummer to remove overly vigorous sprouts.
 
✓ Disease resistance: This aspect is key when you’re choosing apple variet-
ies for organic orchards. Apple scab, cedar apple rust, powdery mildew, 
and fire blight devastate many common varieties, which makes them 
unsuitable for home orchards. Although the names of improved variet-
ies may be unfamiliar, the fruit is just as flavorful. Some disease-resistant 
apple varieties worth seeking out, listed from those that ripen earliest 
(late summer) to latest (mid- to late autumn), include Redfree, Prima, 
Novamac, JonaFree, Priscilla, Freedom, Liberty, Nova Easygro, Enterprise, 
and GoldRush. Although you may not see these varieties in the super-
market, many farmers’ markets and organic cooperatives offer the fruit in 
season, so you can do a taste test before you buy your own trees.
 
Apples have several serious pests that make them a challenge to grow organi-
cally. Plum curculio, apple maggot, and codling moths damage the developing 
fruits, frequently making them inedible. See Chapter 8 for more on these pests 
and how to control them.

256
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
European and Asian pears
Pears (Pyrus species) share many quirks and characteristics with apples, and 
they grow in similar climates. Like apples, pears are usually sold as grafted 
trees and require similar pruning and training. With their glossy dark green 
foliage, pears make especially good landscape specimens in addition to pro-
viding delicious fruit.
You can choose between European and Asian pears. They share most cul-
tural attributes but differ in some other ways:
 
✓ Pollination: Most European pears require another variety planted 
within 50 feet for cross-pollination. Asian pears are mostly self-fruitful 
but produce heavier crops when cross-pollinated.
 
✓ Shape: European pear fruits have the traditional pear shape, with a wide 
bottom tapering to a narrower top. Most Asian pears resemble round 
apples.
 
✓ Texture: European pears have soft, melting flesh when ripe. Asian pears 
have crisp, applelike flesh.
Unfortunately, pears also share many diseases and insect pests with apples. 
Fire blight is its most devastating disease, and pear scab can render the trees 
and fruit unsightly. Avoid planting fire-blight-prone varieties, and control 
insect pests that spread the disease. Pear psylla, an insect that resembles 
a winged yellow-to-orange aphid, sucks the juice out of new foliage and 
excretes sticky droppings that support a black, sooty-looking fungus. You can 
control it with dormant spray oil and beneficial insects.
Fire-blight-resistant varieties of European pear, listed in order of ripening, 
include Harrow Delight, Harvest Queen, Starking Delicious, Moonglow, Stark 
Honeysweet, Magness, Seckel, and Harrow Sweet. The earliest varieties 
begin ripening in mid-August in Zone 5, with the latest finishing up in late 
September. Disease-resistant Asian varieties include Shinko, Shinseiki, Large 
Korean (also known as Dan Beh), Korean Giant, and Olympic.
 
Pears are best picked when they’re still somewhat hard and allowed to ripen 
at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Fruit that overripens on the tree 
develops hard, gritty spots in the flesh and may turn brown and mushy near 
the core. Asian pears and late-season European pears keep for months in the 
refrigerator if they’re picked just before ripeness.

257
 Chapter 16: Fruits and Nuts for Your Organic Orchard
Sweet and sour cherries
Cherries (Prunus) are glorious in their spring bloom; the fruit seems like a 
bonus. In Zone 5, cherries ripen from June into July, providing the first tree 
fruit of the season. Most cherries are red when ripe, but some sweet cher-
ries are yellow. Cherries belong to the Prunus genus, along with peaches, 
almonds, and plums.
Although sweet and sour or tart cherries are similar in many respects, they 
differ in significant ways:
 
✓ Pollination: Sweet cherries need cross-pollination, except for the variety 
Stella, so you need two compatible varieties. Sour cherries, also called 
pie cherries, are self-pollinating. Sour cherries can pollinate sweet cher-
ries but may not bloom at the same time. (The trees must bloom at the 
same time for the varieties to cross-pollinate.)
 
✓ Hardiness: Sweet-cherry trees grow reliably only in Zones 5 to 8, but 
some sour cherries thrive in Zone 4.
 
✓ Culinary use: Sweet cherries, common in supermarkets in early 
summer, are best when eaten fresh. Sour cherries make the best pies 
and jams, but you have to grow your own; markets rarely offer them. 
Some varieties are sweet enough to eat fresh, too.
The pests that plague apples, including plum curculio and apple maggot, also 
infest cherries, as do the cherry fruit fly and Oriental fruit moth. Birds will 
also take a portion of the crop, if not the whole thing, unless you cover the 
ripening fruit with a net. Birds tend to bother tart cherries less than sweet 
cherries, but better to be safe than sorry. The fruits of some varieties tend to 
crack in the rain as they ripen, but others resist this bad habit.
Of the diseases that affect all Prunus species, black knot fungus, bacterial 
canker, and leaf spot are the most serious. Practice good sanitation by raking 
up foliage and dropped fruit, and prune out any infected wood immediately.
 
For best flavor, let sweet and sour cherries ripen fully on the tree before pick-
ing, but keep them covered to prevent bird theft!
Montmorency is the most widely grown commercial sour cherry, but other 
varieties — such as Morello, Meteor, and Northstar — are good choices for 
home orchards. Good sweet-cherry varieties for homegrown fruit include 
Stella, Lapins, Glacier, Surefire, and Sunburst, which are self-pollinating. Bing, 
which is the most common commercial variety, is susceptible to canker and 
fruit splitting. Good varieties that require cross-pollination include Van and 
yellow cherries Emperor Francis, Stark Gold, and Rainier.

Peaches and nectarines
Peaches and nectarines (Prunus persica) are actually the same species, but 
peaches are fuzzy, and nectarines are smooth-skinned. They have the same 
diseases and pests as cherries but are worth growing for the juicy flavor and 
aroma that comes only from freshly picked, sun-ripened fruit. They are self-
pollinating, so you need only one tree.
 
Geography and climate influence peach growing rather significantly. Diseases 
and pests that are prevalent in some parts of the United States cause little 
concern in other areas. Plum curculio, bacterial leaf spot, and fungus dis-
eases, for example, present problems for peaches in the eastern United States, 
approximately from Fort Worth, Texas, to Fargo, North Dakota. Gardeners 
west of that region have an easier time growing peaches organically, except in 
the Pacific Northwest, where the damp climate encourages diseases. If you’re 
in the eastern United States, vigilant housekeeping, pruning, and choosing a 
site that encourages air circulation, as well as using natural pesticides, can 
help you grow this problem-prone crop.
Peaches and nectarines grow reliably only in climates with mild winters and 
fairly dry summers, preferably Zones 6 to 9, although some varieties produce 
fruit in warmer parts of Zones 4 and 5. The hardiness of their overwintering 
flower buds is the limiting factor in cold-winter climates; several consecu-
tive nights of –13 degrees Fahrenheit will kill them. Mild weather in winter or 
early spring followed by a return to freezing weather also spells disaster for 
their blooms. Plant breeders have developed varieties, such as Reliance and 
Veteran, that withstand temperatures as low as –25 degrees Fahrenheit, but 
they usually are less flavorful than peaches grown in warmer climates. If you 
want to try growing peaches in Zone 4 or 5, choose varieties with high chill 
requirements because they bloom later in the season.
Gardeners in Zones 9 and 10 can grow peaches successfully if they choose 
varieties with low chill requirements. Some varieties developed for Florida, 
for example, need only 150–400 hours below 45 degrees Fahrenheit to bear 
fruit.
Peaches and nectarines bloom on wood that grew in the previous year, 
so prune them in June after flowering. Maintain an open-centered form, 
and encourage lots of new growth each year. Maintain a vigilant pest- and 
disease-control program, too, because peach and nectarine trees are among 
the most susceptible to attack of all fruit trees. Peach leaf curl — a serious 
fungus disease — causes leaves and fruit to drop prematurely. Look for 
varieties that resist canker, brown rot, bacterial leaf spot, and pit splitting. 
Catalog or plant-tag descriptions usually tell you whether a variety is resis-
tant to particular diseases.

259
 Chapter 16: Fruits and Nuts for Your Organic Orchard
Peach varieties that resist bacterial leaf spot include Harrow Diamond, 
Harrow Beauty, Delta, Southern Pearl, Desert Gold, Candor, Sweethaven, 
Redhaven, Reliance, Harbrite, Harken, and Veteran. Nectarine varieties 
include Sunraycer, Fantasia, RosePrincess, Mericrest, Hardired, and Harko.
European and Asian apricots
Members of the Prunus genus, European and Asian apricots enjoy the same 
mild climates and well-drained soils as peaches. Although plum curculio, 
codling moth, and brown rot can infest the fruits, the trees are more vigor-
ous and resistant to disease than peaches. Prune apricot trees to a modified 
central leader or open-center form. If you can grow them in your climate, give 
apricots a try, because they have beautiful early-spring flowers followed by 
luscious fruit that supermarkets just can’t match. Unfortunately, spring frosts 
damage the tender blooms in cold regions.
 
European apricots that you may see in your grocery’s produce section grow 
on 10- to 30-foot trees that thrive in the warmer, drier parts of Zones 6 to 8. 
Trees grown in cool, humid climates produce less fruit, and it tends to be of 
poorer quality.
Choose varieties that are suitable for your specific climate. Local nurseries 
and your local extension office can make knowledgeable recommendations. 
Choose a freestone variety (discussed in the “Peaches and nectarines” sec-
tion) if you want to dry the ripened fruits for storage. Good varieties include 
Harcot, Harglow, Hargrand, Harlayne, Puget Gold, Veecot, and Goldcot. For 
best flavor, allow the fruits to ripen on the tree before picking in July and 
early August.
Plums and prunes
Plums and prunes are among the most genetically complicated fruits in the 
Prunus group, because several species share the name plum, and all the vari-
ous species commonly interbreed. The resulting fruits fall into several broad 
categories, including European, Japanese, and prune plums. They differ in 
important ways:
 
✓ Japanese plums are round, usually require cross-pollination to set fruit, 
and are pruned to an open-centered shape. They generally are hardy to 
Zone 6 and warmer parts of Zone 5, although some hybrids are hardier. 
Varieties include Shiro, Early Golden, Burbank, Redheart, Santa Rosa, 
Methley, and Beauty. Hybrids Elite, Superb, Tecumseh, Perfection, and 
Brookgold are hardy through Zone 4.

260
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ European plums are oval, and most don’t need a second variety for pol-
lination. Train these trees to a modified leader form. Most varieties are 
hardy through Zone 5, and some produce fruit even in Zone 4. Varieties 
include Damson, Seneca, Verity, and Green Gage.
 
✓ Prune plums are European plums with drier flesh and a high sugar 
content that makes them suitable for drying. Common varieties include 
Stanley, French Prune, Fellenberg or Italian Prune, Valor, Earliblue, 
Sugar, and Mount Royal (which is hardy in Zone 4).
 
Japanese and European plums can’t pollinate each other, so if your trees 
require cross-pollination, be sure to choose compatible varieties. Five to eight 
weeks after bloom, thin the fruits to hang 4 to 6 inches apart. Fruits ripen from 
July through September, starting with Japanese plums and ending with prune 
plums, depending on the variety.
Plant breeders have also crossed apricots with plums to create hybrids 
called apriums, plumcots, and pluots. These trees are hardy wherever 
European apricots grow, require cross-pollination, and otherwise have char-
acteristics of both parents.

Warm-Climate Fruit Trees
These trees grow where winter temperatures remain mild — generally in Zones 
8 and warmer. Evergreen species, such as citrus, perish when the thermometer 
reaches or goes more than a few degrees below freezing, although some citrus 
varieties can grow in colder climes. Deciduous fruits like figs and persimmons 
are somewhat hardier, especially if you give them a favorable site. Gardeners 
in colder climates can grow some of these fruits successfully in containers, 
moving them to sheltered places in the winter or growing them as houseplants.
Citrus
This large tropical and subtropical group covers a wide range of juicy fruits 
from tiny kumquats to huge pummelos, which require almost frost-free cli-
mates to produce fruit (most can take 25–28 degrees Fahrenheit for several 
hours) and hot summers to help ripen and sweeten the fruit. These trees 
need temperatures between 70–90 degrees Fahrenheit for best growth. In the 
United States, the citrus-growing region is limited to Florida, coastal areas of 
the Gulf Coast states, and parts of Arizona and California.
Citrus trees have evergreen foliage, and most have thorny limbs. Trees usu-
ally are grafted (see the “Size does matter” section earlier in this chapter). 
Most species bloom in early spring and don’t require cross-pollination. Fruit 
ripens from autumn to spring, but some everbearing trees produce fruit year-
round. Allow fruit to ripen on the tree for best flavor. Here’s a rundown of 
some popular citrus fruits:
 
✓ Grapefruits: Grown primarily in Florida and southern Texas, the trees 
reach 30 feet in height. Varieties include seeded and seedless types, and 
those with red, pink, or white flesh.
 
✓ Kumquats: A bit hardier and smaller than most citrus trees, kumquats can 
tolerate temperatures as low as 18–20 degrees Fahrenheit and also make 
good houseplants. You can eat the small fruits whole — rind and all.
 
✓ Lemons and limes: Among the most cold-sensitive citrus, this group 
grows best in frost-free climates. Some varieties do well as houseplants, 
producing the sour fruits indoors.
 
✓ Mandarins: Members of this large group have somewhat flattened 
shapes and loose, easy-to-peel skins. Varieties include tangerines, clem-
entines, and tangelos. The Calamondin variety makes a good houseplant 
or container shrub, and produces loads of small fruit with edible rinds. 
Most mandarin varieties need Zone 9 and warmer, although Calamondin 
and Satsuma varieties tolerate temperatures down to 20 degrees 
Fahrenheit.

262
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Oranges: You can choose among many varieties, which vary in ease of 
peeling, sweetness, number of seeds, hardiness, quality of juice, color, 
and time of ripening. Although most types ripen during December and 
January, some are ready to pick in November; others, such as juicy 
Valencia varieties, don’t ripen until late winter to spring. Navel oranges 
are among the hardiest varieties.
 
Annual pruning isn’t necessary for citrus trees, which is a good thing, because 
most of these trees sport long, sharp thorns. They require pruning mostly 
just to keep the centers of the trees open to light and air and to remove dead 
branches. If trees get too big to pick easily, you can cut back the limbs with 
thinning cuts (see Chapter 19) every year or two. Wait to prune frost-nipped 
trees until new growth shows the extent of damage. To prevent sunburn after 
pruning, paint exposed branches that were previously shaded by foliage with 
whitewash made from a 1:1 mix of water and a white water-based paint.
Citrus demands moist but well-drained soil and regular applications of nitro-
gen fertilizer beginning in January and ending in late summer. Adequate 
water is especially necessary when the trees are actively growing and devel-
oping fruit. Pests and diseases infrequently cause problems except when 
trees are stressed from drought or other weather-related factors. Scale, 
mites, thrips, and whiteflies may infest these trees, in addition to cankers 
that infect the wood. You can easily control most pests with fine oil spray, as 
described in Chapter 8.
Figs
These attractive trees have smooth, gray bark and large, lobed, tropical-
looking leaves. Figs (Ficus carica) can take winter cold down to 15 degrees 
Fahrenheit, but freezing temperatures kill the upper branches and even the 
trunk of the tree. When this happens, the tree sprouts up from its roots and 
forms a shrub with several stems. Following such a freeze, the plants may not 
produce fruit in the following season, depending on the variety.
Figs grow best in subtropical climates with mild winters and long, hot sum-
mers to ripen their fruit. They need well-drained soil.
Figs make good container specimens for climates where they can’t survive 
outdoors year-round. Move the containers into a cool, protected location 
where temperatures remain above freezing. Bring the plants into a warm, 
sunny location in early spring when the buds begin to swell.
Figs typically ripen two crops per year in warm climates. Leave the fruit on 
the trees to fully ripen before picking, but protect them from hungry birds. 
Prune to encourage new shoots, prevent branch crowding, and remove dead 

263
 Chapter 16: Fruits and Nuts for Your Organic Orchard
wood. Encourage the plant to form three to five main stems. If you prune 
when the trees are dormant, you’ll decrease or eliminate the first crop but 
increase the second crop of the year.
Fig trees have no serious pests except for fruit flies and ants, which attack 
the fruit in some climates. In some areas, the trees are prone to fig rust. (See 
Chapter 9 for more on disease control.) Brown Turkey, Celeste, Magnolia, 
and Mission are common varieties.
Persimmon
This lovely landscape tree grows up to 25 feet tall and wide, with bright 
yellow, red, and orange fall foliage and gracefully drooping branches. Its 
orange fruit dangles from the ends of the limbs as they ripen. Although this 
tree can withstand winter temperatures to 0 degrees Fahrenheit, in colder 
regions it tends to break dormancy and begin growing before the cold 
weather has fully departed.
Plant persimmons in well-drained, acidic soil, but keep the soil moist, especially 
during the summer, when the tree is carrying fruit. Prune only to establish a 
modified central-leader branching structure of young trees and to remove dead 
and damaged limbs from mature trees.
Persimmons have few serious pests or diseases, although fungus disease can 
affect the fruit late in the season, and trees are susceptible to wilt disease in 
some areas. Control scale insects with dormant oil spray in late winter. The 
trees need little pruning.
Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki) fruit falls into two categories: astrin-
gent and nonastringent. The fruit of the astringent varieties is eaten when 
the flesh is soft and almost jellylike, whereas nonastringent varieties can be 
eaten when firm. Some varieties have seeds; others are seedless. The best 
astringent varieties include Saijo, Tanenashi, and Yomato Hyakume. Good 
nonastringent varieties include Fuyu, Hanagosho, and Hana Fuyu.
Female trees don’t need male trees to set fruit and, in fact, produce seedy 
fruit with dark streaks in the flesh when pollinated. Harvest in autumn when 
the fruit feels slightly soft. Protect from birds.
The common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), which is native to the United 
States, grows vigorously from Zones 4 to 9, and spreads easily from seeds 
eaten by birds and animals. The trees tend to form thickets of suckers. Fruits 
measure 1 to 2 inches across. Some varieties with larger fruit exist.

264
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Oh, Nuts!
Plant these ornamental or shade trees, and enjoy the nut harvest as an added 
treat. Most nut trees need little care but can be messy when the fruit and 
foliage drop. Plant the large-nut species, such as walnuts and pecans, where 
you can enjoy their beauty without worrying about falling nuts. Use smaller 
species, such as filberts, as hedges or small landscape trees. Most nut trees 
and shrubs require cross-pollination, which means you need two compatible 
varieties to produce nuts.
Filberts
Also known as hazelnuts (Corylus species), these delicious nuts grow on 
ornamental 20-foot-high trees or large shrubs in Zones 5 to 8. Several species 
exist, but the one most commonly grown is the European filbert (Corylus avel-
lana). Native North American species (C. americana) have smaller nuts that 
make excellent wildlife food but can be harvested as well. European filberts 
like moist, well-drained soil and climates in which late-spring frosts don’t 
damage their flower buds, but native species tolerate a wider range of condi-
tions from Georgia into Canada. Commercially, European filberts grow best 
in the coastal valleys of the Pacific Northwest, where summers are cool and 
winters mild.
Filberts require cross-pollination with another filbert variety to set fruit, 
which is ready to harvest in late summer. Variety pairs that can pollinate 
each other include Barcelona with either Daviana or Casina and Royal with 
Hall’s Giant. Prune and train to a central-leader tree or maintain as a shrub. 
Collect the nuts as they fall from the trees; dry them in the sun until the ker-
nels snap when bitten; and store them in a cool, dry place.
Squirrels and nut-eating birds are the most serious pests. Eastern filbert 
blight, however, is a devastating disease that has no known cure. The native 
North American species is less affected than the European filbert.
Almonds
Almonds (Prunus amygdalus) are related to peaches, plums, and apricots, and 
require similar growing conditions. Although the trees are hardy to Zone 6, 
they have a chilling requirement of only 300 to 500 hours (see the “Chill out” 
section, earlier in this chapter), which results in early-spring flowering. Warm 

265
 Chapter 16: Fruits and Nuts for Your Organic Orchard
spring weather followed by a cold snap ruins their lovely pink flowers and 
damages their developing fruits. Warm, dry summers in Zones 6 to 9 ensure a 
good harvest of the sweet oval nuts.
Trees range in height from 10 to 40 feet, depending on the rootstock and vari-
ety. They require cross-pollination to set fruit except for the varieties All-in-One 
and Garden Prince.
Pests and diseases are the same as for peaches. Train trees to an open-center 
shape, and remove limbs that become unfruitful. Almonds fruit on spurs up 
to 5 years old. Harvest the nuts in early to midautumn by shaking or knocking 
them from the tree when the hulls begin to split. Let them sun-dry for a day 
or two and then store them in a cool, dry place.
Pecans
Pecans (Carya illinoensis) grow best in peach country in Zones 6 to 9, but 
they need at least 140 to 200 or more frost-free days to develop their fruit, 
depending on the variety. Although these trees may live in cool climates, 
they may not produce fruit unless temperatures remain in the 75–85 degrees 
Fahrenheit range. High humidity encourages disease and other problems. 
They can serve as 60- to 100-foot shade trees in large home landscapes, 
although the dropping fruits can make quite a mess on the lawn.
Choose varieties that grow well in your climate and look for varieties with 
thin nuts that are easy to shell. Pecans are grouped according to growing 
conditions:
 
✓ Warm, humid climates: Look for scab-resistant varieties that tolerate 
humidity. Varieties include Stuart, Candy, Chickasaw, and Choctaw.
 
✓ Cold-winter climates: Choose pecans that can mature their nuts within 
the shorter growing season, such as Colby, Starking Hardy Giant, and 
Fritz.
 
✓ Arid climates: These varieties — including Cheyenne, Sioux, and 
Western Schley — are often susceptible to scab disease but grow in 
more alkaline soil.
Pecans require cross-pollination and adequate water to set good crops. Keep 
the soil moist during the growing and fruiting season. Train the young trees 
to a modified central-leader form, and prune older trees to remove dead or 
undesirable limbs.

266
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Walnuts
These stately 50- to 150-foot shade trees grow from Zones 4 to 9, depending 
on the species, variety, and origin of the seedling. They enjoy fertile, deep 
soils with adequate moisture and require cross-pollination to produce good 
fruit. English and black walnuts are the two most commonly available types:
 
✓ English walnuts (Juglans regia) grow primarily in Zones 5 to 9 and have 
thin shells. They are susceptible to walnut blight on early-spring foliage, 
especially in cool, damp climates. Codling moths and walnut husk flies 
damage developing young nuts. To ensure high-quality nuts, choose 
grafted varieties such as Lake, Stark Champion, Hartley, and Franquette.
 
✓ Black walnuts (J. nigra) are native North American trees that grow as 
far north as Zone 4. They have hard shells and intensely flavored nuts. 
The lumber from these huge trees is valuable for fine woodworking. 
Choose locally adapted trees to ensure their hardiness in your area. 
Although black walnuts are often grown from seed, cultivated varieties 
include Thomas and Ohio. Black-walnut roots produce a chemical that 
inhibits the growth of many other trees and plants. Flower and vegetable 
gardens may not grow readily within the root zone of these trees.
 
 You may have to fight off the squirrels, but collect the nuts as they fall, 
and remove the husks as soon as possible to hasten drying. The hulls 
contain a yellow-orange dye that readily stains everything they touch, so 
take care when handling them.

In This Chapter

▶ Designing with annuals, perennials, and bulbs

▶ Planting and maintaining flower gardens
T
rees and shrubs give your landscape structure, and vegetables and 
fruits put food on the table, but flowers are pure fun. You plant them to 
bring your landscape to life — to add color, vibrancy, drama, and romance. 
Daffodils, tulips, and other spring bulbs cheerfully greet the end of winter, 
whereas annual and perennial flowering plants put on a constantly changing 
and colorful show from one end of the growing season to the other.
Flowers are among the easiest crops to grow organically. Yes, insects and 
diseases do bother some of them, but you have many control strategies to 
choose among. Keeping them well fed isn’t hard, either. This chapter covers 
all the basics you need to grow happy flowers almost year-round.
Mixing It Up with Flowers: The Basics
Flowers are diverse, resilient, and compatible with one another. You can mix 
them up any way you like, and as long as you give them their basic food, soil, 
water, and sun requirements, you can reasonably expect loads of blooms 
or attractive foliage. Even if a plant dies or gets eaten by bugs, it usually 
costs little to replace. In the case of annuals, which live only for the summer 
anyway, you can always try again next year.
 
Promoting diversity in any garden and landscape is a crucial part of organic 
gardening, and nowhere is it easier than in the flower garden. Except for large 
formal plantings or commercial-cut flower fields, most gardeners grow only a 
few plants of each flower species or variety and tend to mix them up in their 
gardens. Here are a few good reasons to continue that practice:

268
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Beneficial insects and other organisms, which fight harmful pests and 
diseases, thrive in diverse environments.
 
✓ Season-long color is easier to manage when you plant perennials, annu-
als, and bulbs that bloom at different times throughout the spring, 
summer, and fall. You can mix and match color schemes, too.
 
✓ You can save garden space by planting ornamental vegetables and 
herbs in your flower beds or by planting flowers in your vegetable or 
herb garden. You can plant bulbs right under the root zones of annuals 
and perennials to extend the season of color.
 
✓ You can fool pests by planting only a few plants of each species in spots 
around the garden or landscape. The critters may find some — but not 
all — of your zinnias or lilies!
Before you fill out the catalog order form or head out to the garden center 
to buy every flower that tickles your fancy, take time to plan your garden 
for success and prepare your soil, as the following sections explain. (For 
more info on garden planning and soil preparation, go to Chapters 3 and 5, 
respectively.)
Designing for year-round beauty
Flowers come in a rainbow of colors and a vast array of shapes and sizes. 
To me, mixing and matching them with creative flair is the best part of gar-
dening. As you’re planning your garden, choose plants to provide color and 
texture in all four seasons. Spring-flowering bulbs start off the season, fol-
lowed by summer’s bountiful blooms. Fall brings mums and asters, as well as 
colorful foliage, and winter snow decorates ornamental grasses and the seed 
heads of late bloomers. 
 
When you design your flower garden, whether you choose annuals, perenni-
als, bulbs, or combinations of each, keep in mind that plants have a greater 
impact when you plant them in groups of the same kind. A single petunia looks 
lost in a 5-x-20-foot border, for example, but six petunias of the same color 
make a bold statement. The same goes for perennials; always plant at least 
three and preferably five or more of each kind, especially the smaller varieties. 
With bulbs, I consider a dozen the bare minimum for tulips and daffodils and 
two dozen for crocus and small bulbs. Plant in circular or free-form groups, 
and avoid rigid rows.
 
Annuals complete their life cycle in a single year, whereas perennials grow 
from one year to the next, usually sprouting from their overwintering roots. 
Bulbs are perennial plants that store food in special swollen stems or roots.

269
 Chapter 17: Say It with Flowers
Preparing your soil
Annual flowers grow rapidly from seedling to mature flowering plant in just a 
few short weeks, so they need plenty of good nutrition. Perennials and bulbs, 
too, need to put down roots and develop leafy tops to make food for their 
roots, which live from one year to the next. Adequate soil fertility, moisture, 
and organic matter keep your flowers growing robustly, producing more and 
larger blooms, and fending off pests and diseases.
When you’re done preparing your soil, make a list of plant combinations that 
suit your site; then boldly go forth to make your selections. For information 
on choosing the healthiest specimens and proper planting techniques, refer 
to Chapter 12.
Caring for your flower garden
Consistent maintenance throughout the growing season guarantees plenty of 
flowers and lush, healthy plants. Perennials and bulbs, which live for more 
than a year, are better prepared for winter, too, when they’ve had adequate 
nutrition and water during the summer and fall.
Keeping your garden looking good and growing strong doesn’t have to be a 
lengthy chore if you take a few minutes each day or on the weekend. Here’s 
what you can do to keep your garden looking its best:
 
✓ Deadhead: Removing spent flowers — a practice called deadheading — 
before they go to seed keeps annuals and some perennials blooming longer. 
Snip or pinch the dead flower off, making the cut just above a bud or a leaf.
 
✓ Pinch: Flowers that get tall and floppy, especially perennial asters and 
chrysanthemums, stay more compact if you pinch back their early-
summer stems to encourage them to grow shorter and more numerous 
shoots. When the plants reach 1 foot high in spring, snip off the top 3 to 
4 inches. Repeat once more in midsummer, but not after you see flower 
buds forming.
 
✓ Support: Some tall, floppy flowers, such as delphiniums and peonies, 
need a little help to stay upright. Use bamboo stakes to tie up individual 
delphinium or lily stalks. Surround peony clumps with purchased cir-
cular wire or homemade stake-and-twine supports. I often use branches 
left over from tree and shrub pruning to support plants, too.
 
✓ Scout for problems: As you walk through the garden, keep a sharp eye 
out for anything unusual, such as holes in flowers or leaves, wilting, 
insects, or off-color foliage. Catch a problem early, and you have a better 
chance of solving it without taking drastic action.

270
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Fertilize: Plants need plenty of fuel to keep pumping out the flowers. 
Supplement your fertile soil with composted manure in the spring, and 
feed again in midsummer with a mild complete fertilizer, such as fish 
emulsion.
 
✓ Water: If Mother Nature provides regular, gentle rainfall from spring 
through fall, you’ve got it made. Otherwise, you may have to supple-
ment. Dig into the top 6 to 8 inches of soil, and if it’s dry, irrigate your 
garden until the water reaches an 8-inch depth. Shallow watering that 
wets only the top few inches encourages roots to grow close to the sur-
face, where they’re more vulnerable to drought.
 
✓ Weed: No, weeding isn’t the most fun, but it’s necessary. Pull up or hoe 
small weeds as soon as they appear, disturbing the soil as little as pos-
sible. Try corn gluten meal (see Chapter 6) as a fertilizer in established 
beds because it also prevents weed seeds from sprouting. Replace or 
add more mulch as needed to smother weeds, but keep the mulch an 
inch or two away from plant stems.
If you grow flowers in gardens surrounded by lawn, as I do, you face the addi-
tional chore of edging. Edging means keeping the lawn and the flowers sepa-
rated by a barrier. I use a half-moon edging tool to cut away a slice of lawn 
around the entire perimeter of the garden in the spring and again in midsum-
mer. To use the tool, push the blade straight down into the turf about 4 to 6 
inches, and pull the handle back toward yourself to pop out the wedge. Other 
edging options include flexible plastic edging (available at garden centers) 
that you install around the garden or bricks, landscape timber, or stones. 
If you use these materials, bury them so that they’re flush with the ground, 
which makes mowing easier.
Annual Events
Annual plants live short but spectacular lives because they have to accomplish 
their entire life’s purpose — perpetuating the species — in only one growing 
season. Most annuals bloom nonstop from spring to autumn or until they 
succeed in setting seed. The secret to keeping annuals blooming all summer is 
preventing the plants from forming seeds by deadheading (see “Caring for your 
flower garden,” earlier in this chapter). Some plants that you may consider to 
be annuals — such as Vinca rosea, ivy geraniums, and begonias — actually are 
perennials in nonfreezing climates. Count yourself lucky if you can enjoy these 
plants year-round.
Use versatile annuals anywhere you want nonstop color. Plant them in mixed 
gardens with perennials to provide constant bloom, in the cut-flower garden 
for bouquets, or in hanging baskets and patio planters for portable color. You 
can also dedicate a garden just to them. The beauty of annuals is that you 

271
 Chapter 17: Say It with Flowers
can change the garden completely from one year to the next to suit your 
current taste and whim.
Hundreds of annual flowering plants are available in every shape, form, color, 
and size imaginable, and it’s beyond the scope of this book to describe them 
all. I’ve divided a few of the most popular annuals into categories to help you 
find the best ones for each landscape use. Consult the label that comes with 
each particular plant for spacing and cultural requirements.
 
Some annuals, especially those with large seeds, are easy to start yourself from 
seed, either right in the garden or in the house before transplanting. Refer to 
Chapter 12 for information on starting from seed. The easiest flowers to grow 
from seed include calendula, cosmos, marigold, zinnia, aster, nasturtium, 
morning glory, sunflower, and sweet pea. Plants with tiny seeds — such as 
begonia, petunia, and impatiens — are tough to start or need several months of 
pampering before they’re ready for the garden.
Bedding plants for mass planting
Gardens devoted to just annuals make a big impact along streets, sidewalks, 
and other places where the mass of color is more important than the individ-
ual plants. Look for plants that grow fairly low (usually up to a foot high) and 
that bloom for at least two to three months with little maintenance. Bright 
red, yellow, orange, and white work best in plantings viewed from a distance; 
cool blue and purple are better for close-range viewing. To find the number 
of plants you need to fill a 100-square-foot garden (10 feet x 10 feet), consult 
Table 17-1.

Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Cutting flowers for bouquets
Plants that produce long stems for cutting, as well as colorful or fragrant 
flowers, are tops in my garden. Many of these plants mix well in a perennial 
border, or you can devote a row in your vegetable garden to them. If you 
have space and a passion for bouquets, give them a garden of their own. 
Don’t forget to add some everlasting flowers, such as statice and strawflower, 
which have papery petals that remain colorful for months or even years 
when dried. Use them for making dried bouquets and craft projects.
 
For the freshest and longest-lasting bouquets, cut the flowers in the morning 
before the sun heats up, and plunge the stems right into a bucket of water. Use 
a sharp knife or scissors to cut stems at a 45-degree angle, and choose stems 
with only partially opened buds. Strip the leaves from the submerged parts of 
the stems. Use clean vases and change the water daily, adding a floral preser-
vative or two to three drops of bleach per quart.
Great annuals for cutting include aster, baby’s breath, calendula, campanula, 
cosmos, sweet William, gloriosa daisy, larkspur, lisianthus, pincushion flower 
(scabiosa), salpiglossis, salvia, snapdragon, stock, sweet pea, sunflower, and 
zinnia. For dried-flower bouquets, try strawflower, statice, cornflower, salvia, 
celosia, ageratum, globe amaranth, larkspur, baby’s breath, and love-in-a-mist. 
Cut them before the flowers open fully; bundle the stems with a rubber band; 
and hang them to dry in a cool, dry, airy place away from the sun.
Foliage fillers
Flowers usually take center stage, but you need supporting players too. 
Plants with attractive foliage provide a soothing foil for their more flamboy-
ant companions, although some plants have foliage that’s colorful enough 
to stand alone. Popular favorites include dusty miller, coleus, Kochia (or 
firebush), Persian shield, nasturtium Alaska, ornamental cabbage and kale, 
amaranthus, and polka dot plant.
Best for baskets and containers
These plants stay small enough to live in confinement all summer without 
complaint. In containers, you can plant everything closer together than usual, 
but the limited soil space means that the plants need more attention (water-
ing, fertilizing, and pruning) than other landscape and garden plants do.

273
 Chapter 17: Say It with Flowers
 
Although it’s tempting to use your own garden soil to fill containers, consider 
a pasteurized, lightweight alternative instead. When you put garden soil into a 
container, it loses its loose, well-aerated structure and becomes too compact 
for healthy root growth. In most cases, a soilless mix is best. I usually add up 
to 25 percent pasteurized topsoil or composted manure to the mix, as well as 
some water-retaining gel crystals, which help the soil hold more moisture.
For the best design effect, combine trailing, upright, and low-growing plants 
in each container. Good trailing plants include browallia, creeping zinnia, 
lobelia, nasturtium, nierembergia, petunia, scaevola, sweet alyssum, and ver-
bena. Choose bedding plants to fill in most of the container. Consider adding 
a trellis to larger containers to hold an annual vine, such as canary creeper, 
morning glory, or thunbergia.
Perennial Favorites
Perennial plants, by definition, live from year to year, but herbaceous peren-
nials actually die to the ground in the fall and sprout from their roots again 
in the spring. Happy perennials increase in size and bloom potential with 
each growing season that passes. Unlike with annual flowers, however, your 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Hardiness Zone and American Horticultural 
Society (AHS) Heat Zone make a difference in your garden’s success (see 
Chapter 3). Use the information as a guide when buying plants.
Popular myth claims that perennial gardening is low-maintenance compared 
with other types of gardening — you know, plant it once and forget about it. 
That’s simply not true, as any experienced perennial gardener quickly points 
out. Although many plants live for a long time, they also require regular main-
tenance. See “Caring for your flower garden,” earlier in this chapter, to see 
what your perennials need to flourish.
Making more perennials
One of the best features of perennials is that you can start with one plant 
and divide it into more plants as it grows. This trick doesn’t work with all 
perennials, however, especially those with taproots that grow straight down, 
deep into the soil. The best plants for dividing form clumps of stems and 
have fibrous roots. Easy plants to divide include daylilies, hosta, bee balm 
(Monarda species), Siberian iris, ornamental grasses, and almost anything 
else that creeps over the ground, rooting as it grows.

274
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
The best time to divide perennials depends partly on their season of flower-
ing and your climate. I find it easier to divide mid- to late-summer-flowering 
plants, such as asters, in the spring as soon as they start growing. Spring and 
early-summer bloomers, such as peonies and iris, recover better if they’re 
divided later in the summer. A few, such as daylilies and Siberian iris, can be 
divided any time you have a shovel handy.
Here’s the basic method for dividing perennials with fibrous roots:
 
1. Soak the soil to make digging easier.
 
 Water the day before, if possible, so that the soil isn’t still muddy.
 
2. Cut down some or all of the stems to within 6 inches of the ground 
unless you’re dividing newly sprouted plants in the spring.
 
 The roots won’t be able to support big leafy tops until they recover fully.
 
3. Dig up the whole clump, and drag it onto a tarp.
 
 Check it over, looking for groups of rooted stems that could form new, 
self-supporting plants. Blast the clump with spray from the hose to wash 
away soil that obscures the crown, or soak the whole clump to make 
root separation easier.
 
4. Pry, tease, cut, or pull apart the clump.
 
 Some perennials come apart easily; others may require a sharp knife 
or other drastic measures. For large tough grasses, Siberian irises, and 
daylilies, push two garden forks into the clump back to back, and pry 
the handles apart to divide the clump in two, as shown in Figure 17-1. 
Repeat as needed to reduce the clump to manageable pieces.
 
5. Discard dead and less vigorous pieces.
 
6. Replant the pieces as soon as possible.
 
 See Chapter 12 for planting advice.
Some perennial plants, such as bearded iris, get bare spots in their centers as 
they expand outward, so they need dividing to keep them vigorous. Bearded 
irises need slightly different treatment during division. After the plants finish 
blooming, proceed with Steps 1 through 3. Then choose the fattest sections 
of fleshy roots, called rhizomes, with the most vigorous fans of foliage and 
roots. Using a sharp knife, cut the rhizomes apart into one- or two-fan sec-
tions, as shown in Figure 17-2. Discard woody and insect-damaged pieces as 
well as the oldest parts. (The newest rhizomes are firm and grow at the outer 
edges of the clump.) Plant immediately in fertile soil, draping the roots over 
a ridge of soil so that the top of the rhizome is just at the soil surface when 
watered.

Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Using popular perennials
You have hundreds, if not thousands, of perennial plants to choose among. 
Instead of trying to memorize all those plants, think of them in groups. You 
can divide them into groups based on garden placement, cultural require-
ments, flower color, season of bloom, use, or any number of other criteria. 
For more information on gardening with perennials, look for Perennials 
For Dummies, by Marcia Tatroe and the Editors of the National Gardening 
Association (Wiley). I’ve chosen the following categories with organic garden-
ers in mind:
 
✓ Butterfly- and bee-attracting plants: Butterflies and moths glide from 
flower to flower looking for energy-rich nectar. Some of their favorites 
include butterfly weed, aster, butterfly bush, Centaurea, purple and 
orange coneflowers, Joe-pye weed, Penstemon, goldenrod, verbena, 
salvia, and bee balm.
 
✓ Shade-loving perennials: Shade is a relative concept, ranging from 
dense to dappled. Most of these perennials prefer a few hours of direct 
sunlight each day but can survive in all but the deepest shade. For your 
shady nook, try hosta, forget-me-not, pachysandra, lungwort, meadow-
rue, foamflower, myrtle, coral bells, lily-of-the-valley, foxglove, Bergenia, 
wild ginger, and Solomon’s seal.
 
✓ Deer-resistant perennials: Although it seems that deer will eat anything, 
it’s really not true. Plants with strong scent or flavor repel them, as do 
some toxic plants. Resistant plants include alliums, artemesia, black-
eyed Susan, lupine, catmint, delphinium, hellebore, tansy, and yarrow.
 
✓ Hard-to-kill perennials: If you’re just starting or need low-maintenance 
plants, give these tough customers a try. Perennials that can survive 
in well-drained soil almost anywhere include yarrow, Artemesia, tick-
seed (Coreopsis species), Euphorbia, blanket flower, Heliopsis, catmint, 
Oriental poppy, sedum, and feverfew. If your soil tends to run on the 
damp side, try Siberian iris, daylily, bee balm, and mint.
 
✓ Foliage friends: Flowers aren’t everything, and these lovely leafed 
perennials prove it. Although some of these also have nice blooms, for 
fabulous foliage try hosta, dead nettle (Lamium), lungwort (Pulmonaria), 
coral bells, astilbe, peony, thyme, sage, liriope, amsonia, artemesia, 
ginger (Asarum species), Bergenia, crane’s bill geranium, ornamental 
grasses, and many others.
Perennials work well in containers, too. See “Annual Events,” earlier in this 
chapter, for ideas on how to use them in patio planters and baskets.

277
 Chapter 17: Say It with Flowers
Blooming Bulbs
Some plants form swollen underground roots or stems, which people tend to 
lump together and refer to as bulbs. Not all these fleshy appendages are the 
same, however, and the differences affect how you plant and use them, as 
explained in “This side up: Putting down roots,” later in this chapter.
True bulbs — including onions, lilies, tulips, and daffodils — have pointed 
tops and flat bottoms called basal plates, from which roots grow. If you cut 
one open, you see that a bulb consists of rings or layers with developing 
leaves, flowers, or stems in the center. The bulb itself lives from year to year 
and develops new daughter bulbs from its base.
Other bulblike plants form corms, tubers, or rhizomes. Corms — such as 
crocus, colchicum, crocosmia, and gladiola — resemble bulbs, but their flesh 
isn’t layered when it’s cut open. Each corm lives for a single year, but it pro-
duces offsets or new corms around its basal plate. Tubers — such as potatoes, 
caladiums, and tuberous begonias — don’t have a basal plate and sprout 
from several eyes, or growing points. They just grow larger and form more 
eyes each year but don’t produce offsets. Rhizomes, such as bearded iris and 
canna, are simply swollen, creeping stems. They grow from the tip, which 
may branch and root, forming new plants.
To simplify bulbs and bulblike plants, I’ve divided them into two broad 
groups:
 
✓ Spring-blooming bulbs include tulips, narcissus (daffodils), crocus, 
fritillaria, snowdrops, winter aconite, hyacinths, bluebells, and glory of 
the snow (Chionodoxa species). These bulbs survive in the ground in 
cold-winter climates and bloom when the soil warms in the spring. Plant 
them in early autumn to allow them time to root before winter.
 
✓ Summer-blooming bulbs include lilies, alliums, canna, caladium, dahlia, 
gladiola, tuberous begonia, crocosmia, and amaryllis. Many of these bulbs 
are frost-tender; dig them up at the end of the growing season and store 
them in a nonfreezing place. Many species and varieties of lilies and alliums, 
however, are perfectly winter-hardy throughout most USDA hardiness 
zones. Plant tender bulbs in the spring and hardy ones in the fall.
When you shop for bulbs, look for firm, heavy, unblemished specimens. 
Avoid those with gouges or signs of withering, softness, or decay. Bulbs vary 
enormously in size from one species and variety to the next. In general, you 
want to buy top-size bulbs, which usually are the largest bulbs available for 
the particular variety. Landscape-size bulbs are smaller, and produce fewer 
stems and smaller blooms.

278
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
After you get your bulbs home, plant them as soon as possible. If you must 
store them — even briefly — keep them dry and cool (50°F to 65°F). Don’t 
store them with apples or other fruit, however, because ripening fruit gives off 
ethylene gas, which is deadly to dormant flower buds inside the bulbs.
This side up: Putting down roots
Bulbs appreciate the same loose, fertile, well-drained garden soil that your 
other plants enjoy. If you’re planting bulbs in an existing, well-maintained 
garden, you need only add a bit of fertilizer to the hole at planting time; oth-
erwise, turn back to Chapter 5 for more on soil preparation. Slow-release, 
complete, granular fertilizer works best at planting time. Mix it into the soil at 
the bottom of the hole, covering it with a thin layer of unamended soil before 
setting in the bulbs.
 
Contrary to tradition, bonemeal is not the best fertilizer choice for bulbs. 
It attracts skunks and other scavengers willing to dig up a tasty meal. If the 
bonemeal is well mixed in small quantities with composted manure and other 
nutrient-rich fertilizers, however, your garden is less likely to have nocturnal 
visitors.
How deeply you plant your bulbs depends on whether you have true bulbs, 
corms, tubers, or rhizomes. Each is handled a little differently:
 
✓ True bulbs and corms: As a general rule, plant them so that the top is 
buried twice as deep as the bulb is tall. A daffodil that measures 2 inches 
from base to tip, for example, needs a hole 6 inches deep so that 4 inches 
of soil covers the top of the bulb. Bulb companies always provide handy 
charts, too, with specific instructions for each type of bulb. Depending 
on your soil type, you can vary the planting depth a bit. Set bulbs 1 or 
2 inches deeper in sandy soil and 1 to 3 inches more shallowly in heavy 
clay. Gardeners in warm-winter climates who want to grow daffodils can 
plant the bulbs twice as deeply as northern gardeners do.
 
✓ Tubers and rhizomes: These bulbs get special planting treatment 
because they prefer to grow closer to the soil surface. Tuberous bego-
nias and cyclamen, for example, need only 1-inch depth, whereas gladi-
olas and cannas prefer 2 to 3 inches of soil over them. Plant bearded iris 
rhizomes so that the tops of the rhizomes are just barely exposed after 
you water the planting site.
 
Determining which end goes down and which points up is easy for bulbs with 
a pointed top or roots clinging to the bottom. But what do you do with shriv-
eled, featureless anemone tubers? If you can’t tell which side is up, plant the 
bulbs on their sides; the plants will figure things out.

279
 Chapter 17: Say It with Flowers
Planting methods vary depending on whether you’re putting in a handful 
of bulbs or planting dozens. The most efficient system is to dig a hole large 
enough to accommodate a group of bulbs. I dig the hole to the proper depth, 
amend the soil (see Chapter 5), space the bulbs around the hole, backfill, 
and water. Bulbs grow best in the loosened soil. I find those little bulb plant-
ers that look like open-ended tin cans with handles to be useless. You can’t 
amend the soil effectively, planting takes longer, and the soil around the 
sides of the hole remains compact.
Protecting your assets
Bulb-producing plants need leaves to make food and keep their bulbs fat and 
happy during their dormant season. Although yellowing leaves look unsightly 
after the flowers bloom, leave the foliage alone (and resist the urge to braid 
it) until it naturally withers away. If you cut the blooms of lilies, gladiolas, and 
other leafy stemmed plants, leave as much foliage behind as you can. Bulbs 
robbed of their food source will produce fewer — if any — blooms in subse-
quent years.
Finding the best bulb source
You can buy bulbs from so many sources that 
it’s downright confusing to know where to get 
the best value and quality. Here’s my take on 
the choices:
 ✓ Mail-order bulb suppliers have selling 
down to an exact science. Most catalogs 
offer a hefty discount if you order early, 
which results in big savings. Specialty bulb 
suppliers also carry the widest assortment, 
including rare, unusual, and hard-to-find 
bulbs as well as the most popular varieties.
 
 Avoid catalogs that give inadequate 
information or offer prices significantly 
lower than similar catalogs. They may be 
offering smaller bulbs that produce smaller 
and fewer flowers.
 ✓ Garden centers usually start selling bulbs 
shortly after the bulb farmers harvest them, 
which is the right time to plant them in your 
garden. When the bins of bulbs appear in 
the stores, they’re as tempting to a gardener 
as candy to a chocoholic! Go ahead and 
indulge, but keep a few tips in mind: Boxes 
of loose bulbs may get mixed up (think of 
playing children), the selection is relatively 
limited, and the bulbs are often smaller than 
those available from specialty catalogs. On 
the other hand, you usually can inspect the 
bulbs before you buy. Bulbs stored in sunny 
windows or hot corners may not grow as 
well as those stored at cooler (50°F to 65°F) 
temperatures.

280
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
In climates where the ground freezes, gardeners must dig up and store tender 
tropical bulbs, corms, tubers, and rhizomes for the winter. (Tulips, daffodils, 
lilies, and other hardy bulbs can remain in the ground.) You can keep cannas, 
dahlias, tuberous begonias, and other tubers and bulbs from one year to the 
next by putting them in a cool, nonfreezing place. Dig up the bulbs after the 
leaves die back, brush off loose soil, and trim off the leaves and stems. After 
letting them dry for a few days in a nonfreezing place, brush off more soil, 
and place the bulbs in dry wood shavings or peat moss in a cardboard box. 
Don’t let the pieces touch each other. Cover with more shavings or moss, and 
store in a cool, dry place until spring.
Gladiola and similar corms are even easier to store. After brushing off the 
soil, place them in a mesh bag (like the ones that onions come in), and hang 
the bag in a cool (35°F to 41°F) place where mice can’t reach it.
Bulb-munching rodents and deer can take a bite out of your bulb garden, but 
you can take preventive action. My favorite method is to plant bulbs that 
these animals won’t eat, such as narcissus, fritillarias, snowflakes (Leucojum 
species), and snowdrops (Galanthus species). The bulbs are toxic and may 
give some protection to surrounding nontoxic species. Animals seem to stay 
away from alliums, too.
If you want to succeed with tulips, crocus, lilies, and other tempting morsels, 
plant your bulbs in a wire cage (see Figure 17-3) that excludes the trouble-
some animals. Bend hardware cloth into a shallow cage, and bury it at the 
appropriate depth to keep out voles and mice. For the top, choose a wire 
opening large enough to allow the shoots to grow through. Use chicken wire 
for woodchucks and other large diggers.

Run for the Roses
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing trouble-free roses
▶ Getting roses off to a good start
▶ Caring for roses organically
▶ Helping roses get ready for winter
▶ Dealing with common rose pests
R
oses have an undeserved reputation as temperamental, demanding, 
pest-prone plants. That’s why you may have assumed that to grow 
roses successfully, you have to use toxic pesticides. Yet the keys to growing 
roses organically are really quite simple:
 
✓ Choose varieties of roses that grow best in your region.
 
✓ Get the plants off to a strong start by carefully selecting disease and 
pest-resistant plants and planting them properly.
 
✓ Catch and treat pest problems early.
Fortunately, you can find the details on performing all these tasks successfully 
in this chapter.
Making the Right Choice
Over the years, rose fanciers have developed many categories of roses, such 
as hybrid tea and antique roses. Although they share the name rose, each has 
unique features and garden merit.
I prefer to grow plants that don’t need lots of extra care, and you probably 
do, too. So to help you choose the easiest roses for your garden, I’ve com-
pressed all the kinds of roses into two groups, based on how easy or hard 
they are to grow and care for: show roses and garden roses.

282
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Show roses: Show roses produce those beautifully shaped, long-stemmed 
flowers for cutting and arranging. Show roses, however, need plenty of 
TLC to maintain their stylish good looks because they’re prone to pests 
and diseases.
 
 Those classic long-stemmed roses — the kind that made roses so popular 
in the first place — attract the most insects and dastardly rose diseases. 
You may decide to throw good sense to the wind and plant one of these 
varieties despite my good advice to the contrary. Many disease-prone 
roses are among the most popular and readily available varieties at some 
garden centers; your choices include Climbing America, Apricot Nectar, 
Chrysler Imperial, Don Juan, Double Delight, Fragrant Cloud, Mister 
Lincoln, Queen Elizabeth, Pristine, and New Dawn. Nevertheless, you can 
try to grow them organically — that is, with an ecological perspective. 
Also, if you’re planting new roses, keep in mind that many varieties are 
both beautiful and disease-resistant.
 
✓ Garden roses: Garden roses are easy to grow. They’re more like other 
flowering shrubs — laid back and easygoing. They add lots of color and 
fragrance to the garden without too much fuss but aren’t really grown 
for their dramatic bouquet potential.
 
If you’d like to know more about all the kinds and varieties of roses, I highly 
recommend Roses For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Lance Walheim and the 
National Gardening Association (Wiley). It’s one of the most complete and up-
to-date guides available, not to mention the most fun.
Choosing disease-resistant roses
If you’re starting a new rose garden or wanting to replace your pest-prone vari-
eties, try garden roses, because many of them are among the most trouble-free 
plants you can own. Some of my favorite disease-resistant garden roses are 
pink-flowered Baby Blanket, Bonica, Carefree Delight, Carefree Wonder, Cécile 
Brunner, Flower Carpet Pink, Lady of the Dawn, Pink Meidiland, Simplicity, and 
The Fairy; and red-flowered Kardinal, Red Meidiland, and Red Ribbons. Good 
white roses include Alba Meidiland, Bolero, Fabulous, Moon Dance, and Sea 
Foam. Also try orange Livin’ Easy and Ralph’s Creeper, yellow Julia Child, and 
lilac-pink Lavender Dream. Finally, all the roses in the Knock Out series are 
exceptionally resistant to common rose diseases.
Picking winter survivors
Depending on where you live, you must consider hardiness (the rose’s 
ability to survive cold winter temperatures; see Chapter 3). Hardy roses stay 

283
 Chapter 18: Run for the Roses
healthier because they aren’t struggling for survival when spring warmth — 
and pests — return. Gardeners in warm climates, where temperatures rarely 
drop below 15 degrees Fahrenheit, don’t have to worry whether their roses 
will survive the winter. But if you live in colder places, you may have greater 
success if you stick with the roses that can put up with frosty weather.
 
If you live in U.S. Department of Agriculture Zone 5 or colder, you can still 
grow most any kind of rose, but your plants will need winter protection, as 
described in “Preparing Roses for Winter,” later in this chapter. Unless you 
really must have a particular rose variety regardless of its hardiness, I advise 
you to stick to the hardier roses.
Cold-hardy stalwarts that show good disease resistance include Autumn 
Sunset, Blanc Double de Coubert, Bonica, Carefree Beauty, Carefree Wonder, 
John Cabot, The Fairy, and William Baffin. Bred in Canada, roses in the 
Explorer series are very cold-hardy, as are rugosa and moss roses.
Buying Roses
Everybody sells roses — from grocery stores to hardware stores to mail-
order nurseries. Impulsively grabbing a $4 rose with a pretty picture on the 
wrapper and dropping it into your cart, however, won’t guarantee you the 
best value. You’ve heard it before: You get what you pay for.
Different nurseries often sell exactly the same rose varieties, but the differ-
ence is in how they handle the plants. Buy from stores that take good care 
of their roses. Don’t buy plants that have shriveled canes, wilted leaves, or 
dusty dry packing material around their bare roots.
 
Mail-order nurseries can also provide a good selection of high-quality plants. 
Most guarantee their plants to grow and bloom, given normal care. (Look for 
catalogs that list the recommended winter-hardiness zones, too, if you live 
where winters get frigid.)
You can buy roses in two forms: potted and bare root. Bare-root plants are 
dormant and have no soil around their roots. Stores usually have large bins 
full of bare-root roses in plastic-wrapped packages at the start of the growing 
season. Mail-order nurseries also sell bare-root plants because they cost less 
to ship than potted plants and survive transport more easily. Bare-root roses 
grow vigorously after planting as long as they remain cool and moist before 
you buy them.
Both bare-root and potted roses are graded to ensure quality, with Grade 1 
indicating the highest quality.

284
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
Members of local garden clubs and rose societies are always good sources of 
specific information regarding varieties of roses that do well in your area. 
Local rose growers are happy to share their knowledge about varieties that 
grow best where you live and garden. The American Rose Society also offers a 
list of where to buy roses, plus lots of other information. Visit its Web site at 
www.ars.org. The other rose organization you’ll hear about is All-America 
Rose Selections, a not-for-profit organization that evaluates new roses under 
actual garden conditions and then selects and recommends superior varieties 
to the rose-buying public. You can find out more about AARS and its recom-
mendations at www.rose.org.
Planting Roses
Nearly all roses are made of two parts grafted together. The top part, called 
the scion, is the desirable flowering rose. The rootstock, on the bottom, adds 
hardiness and tolerance to a wide range of soil types. Where the two parts 
meet is called the bud union, shown in Figure 18-1.

 Chapter 18: Run for the Roses
Growing beautiful roses begins with putting them in the right place and plant-
ing them properly. The following sections show you how to get your new 
roses off to the best possible start.
Picking an ideal time and place
Roses establish faster, and resist pests and diseases better, when you plant 
them in an ideal location. Roses require at least six hours of direct sunlight 
each day for good flowering and growth. An eastern exposure, which receives 
morning sun, is ideal. Choose a planting location away from shady buildings 
or trees, and avoid trees and shrubs with roots that will compete with the 
roses for moisture and nutrients.
Make sure that the site is open to allow the summer breezes to blow through; 
good ventilation helps keep leaf diseases to a minimum. Also choose a loca-
tion from which water drains promptly. Roses don’t grow well where soil 
stays wet or where water puddles on the surface.
You can plant roses any time from early spring to early fall, but the best plant-
ing time depends on where you live and how your plants are packaged. Plant 
bare-root roses in early to midspring, before the new shoots start to develop 
and before daytime temperatures rise above 70 degrees Fahrenheit — usually 
late March to early April in the middle latitudes of North America. You can 
plant container roses any time from spring to early fall, after danger of spring 
frost and a month or so before danger of fall frost.
Preparing the planting site
Roses thrive in loamy, well-drained garden soil with a pH of 5.5 to 7.0 (see 
Chapter 5). Begin with a soil test to determine pH and nutrient levels so that 
you can make corrections, if necessary, while you prepare the soil.
Most soils, whether clay or sandy, benefit from the addition of organic 
matter, which improves drainage, aeration, and nutrient-holding capacity. 
Spread a 2- to 4-inch layer of organic matter — such as compost, rotted 
manure, shredded leaves, or finely ground potting bark — on the soil surface, 
and work it into the top 8 inches of soil.
To prepare your planting site, follow these steps:
 
1. Dig out enough soil to form a hole approximately 15 inches deep and 
at least 18 inches, but preferably 36 inches, wide.
 
 It’s important to improve the soil in the entire future root zone.

286
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
2. Mix 3 to 6 shovelfuls of your chosen organic matter with the soil 
removed from the hole.
 
3. Add to that mixture about 10 cups of fertilizer made of a half-and-half 
mixture of alfalfa and cottonseed meals, and mix thoroughly.
 
 This substance becomes the backfill soil for the new plant.
Plant spacing varies according to the growth habit of the rose plant. Plants 
that grow too close together are tall and spindly, and produce only a few 
small flowers. For a guide to plant spacing by rose type, see Table 18-1. The 
plant description in the catalog or on the plant tag should tell you what type 
of rose you have and also recommend the proper spacing.

Planting a bare-root rose
Plant bare-root roses as soon as possible after purchasing or receiving 
them through the mail. Unwrap plants from the packaging and soak the root 
system in a bucket of tepid water for about an hour before planting. If you 
must delay planting for a few days, keep the plants moist and in a cool, dark 
location, or place them in a temporary soil trench in a shaded location.
 
Don’t store rose plants with any ripening fruit, such as in a refrigerator or root 
cellar, because the fruit gives off ethylene, which harms growing plants.
Follow these steps to plant your bare-root rose:
 
1. Prune out any damaged or dead roots and stems before planting. 
 
 Refer to Chapter 12 for general information on bare-root plants.

287
 Chapter 18: Run for the Roses
 
2. Make sure that your planting hole is twice as wide as your plant’s root 
spread; then loosen the soil in the bottom of the hole, and make a 
cone of soil.
 
 Use the prepared backfill soil discussed in “Preparing the planting site,” 
earlier in this chapter. 
 
3. Set the plant on top of this cone, spreading out the roots, and then 
check its planting height — the place where the knobby bud union 
(refer to Figure 18-1) is relative to the ground at the top of the hole.
 
 In most parts of the country, adjust the height of the cone until the bud 
union is just above the level of the surrounding soil, as shown in Figure 
18-2. In cold-winter climates (USDA Zones 3 to 5), set the bud union 3 to 
6 inches belowground to help protect it from freezing.
 
Figure 18-2: 
Place the 
roots over a 
cone of soil, 
and adjust 
the depth 
of the bud 
union.
 
 
4. When the rose is properly positioned, begin filling the planting hole 
with the prepared backfill. 
 
5. Work the backfill around each root with your hands, and when you’re 
about halfway done, add water to the hole to settle and moisten the 
soil around the roots. After the water drains away, finish backfilling. 
 
 If you live where irrigation is a necessity, build a water-retaining ring of 
soil around the outside edge of the planting hole, and water again (refer 
to Chapter 12 for building a shallow basin around a plant).
 
6. After the plant is set, mound the canes with an additional 4 to 6 inches 
of soil or mulch to prevent the canes from drying out before roots 
start growing (see Figure 18-3). 
 
 When the new shoots appear and the danger of frost is past, remove this 
soil slowly, over a week’s time.

Planting a container-grown rose
Keep container-grown plants watered and in a sunny location until they can 
be planted in the garden. Make sure that the soil in the pot is moist but not 
sopping wet at planting time to make handling the plant easier. Prune out 
any damaged, dead, or broken stems before planting. Refer to Chapter 12 for 
details on planting container-grown plants.
Cultivating Roses
Roses need plenty of nutrients and regular watering to grow vigorously and 
flower profusely. You don’t need synthetic chemical rose fertilizers, though; 
many organic options are available.
Fertilizing
Organic fertilizers — such as fish emulsion, compost, and aged manure — 
not only contribute nutrients to soils but also provide organic matter that 
has positive, long-term benefits on soil health. Compared with chemical fertil-
izers, organic fertilizers also release their nutrients more slowly over a longer 
period and feed the beneficial soil microorganisms. Therefore, don’t expect 
fast results when you first apply the fertilizer.
 
My favorite organic fertilizer for roses is a half-and-half mix of alfalfa and cot-
tonseed meals. Use about ten cups per plant every ten weeks through the 
growing season, mixing it lightly into the top inch or two of soil.

289
 Chapter 18: Run for the Roses
 
You can save a lot of money if you shop for organic fertilizers like alfalfa and 
cottonseed meal at feed stores rather than at garden centers. Animal-feed 
dealers sell much greater quantities of these materials compared with garden 
centers, so they can offer them at a much lower price per pound. If you can’t 
find the selection of organic fertilizers you like, check with Peaceful Valley 
Farm & Garden Supply at www.groworganic.com or Gardener’s Supply 
Company at www.gardeners.com.
Apply fertilizer when new spring growth is well established and all danger of 
frost has passed. Make a second application four to six weeks after the first 
application, or monthly at lower rates if plants show evidence of mineral 
deficiencies, such as yellowing of leaves from lack of nitrogen.
 
Don’t apply any type of nitrogen fertilizer within six weeks of the expected 
first frost in fall. When applied late in the season, nitrogen may stimulate fresh 
growth and delay hardening of the wood before winter.
Watering
How much and how often you need to water roses depends on several 
conditions, including the type and age of the rose, the soil, where you live, 
and the weather. But if you’re looking for a rule to remember, figure that a 
mature rosebush needs about 1 inch of water per week applied over its root 
zone. Water enough to soak the entire root zone; then wait until the soil is 
dry 2 or 3 inches down to water again. You can check the water penetration 
in the soil by digging out a shovel-length wedge of soil, but try not to damage 
the plant roots in the process.
 
Drip irrigation is particularly useful for organic and conservation-minded 
gardeners because it delivers the water to the root zone under the rosebush 
without waste. Additional benefits include fewer weeds to contend with and 
dry foliage, which reduces the incidence of many diseases. See Chapter 11 for 
more ways to prevent and control weeds.
Pruning Roses
Although some kinds of roses don’t absolutely require pruning to remain in 
good health, most do. Pruning improves the plant’s health by letting more 
air and light reach all the leaves and stems, which discourages some insects 
and diseases. Left unpruned, some roses become a tangled mess of barbed, 
disease-prone canes. Reaching into such a thorny thicket to weed and prune 
takes nerves of steel and heavy leather gloves! Some vigorous roses just 
don’t know where to stop, and you need to prune them to keep their stems 
within bounds.

290
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
Well-pruned roses give you more bang for your buck because you remove the 
weak and unproductive shoots and the spent flowers that divert the plant’s 
energy from making new flowers. Show roses — the kind with the long stems 
and big, luscious blooms — respond especially well to pruning by growing 
even bigger flowers with longer stems. Garden roses that produce clusters of 
flowers bloom more prolifically when you keep them groomed. (For more 
information about show and garden roses, refer to “Making the Right Choice,” 
earlier in this chapter.)
Making the cut
Use only sharp, clean tools to prune roses. Dull blades crush stems and tear 
or fray the edges of the cut, making it easier for diseases to gain a foothold. 
Also, disinfect your tools between plants to prevent the accidental spread 
of disease. Just give the blades a wipe with a cloth dampened in isopropyl 
rubbing alcohol.
Bypass hand pruners are the tools I use most frequently, because they snip 
everything from dead flowers to canes up to 
1⁄2-inch thick. Loppers take care 
of canes up to 1-inch thick, and the long handles allow me to reach into a 
prickly tangle without endangering my arms. If you’re dealing with a big old 
rosebush with large dead canes, use a fine-toothed pruning saw.
Your three primary pruning goals are
 
✓ To remove weak, dead, and undesirable canes
 
✓ To open the center of the bush to air and light
 
✓ To remove old flowers
If you don’t know where to start, remove the dead wood first, cutting back to 
healthy tissue. Living wood is beige or white. If you see dark brown tissue in 
the stem, cut back a little farther.
Most people start getting cold feet when cutting into living wood. Following a 
few simple rules and keeping your goals in mind should alleviate your fears:
 
✓ Prune most roses right after they bloom. Cut the flowers off just above 
a healthy five-leaflet leaf, as shown in Figure 18-4. Cut farther down the 
stem to encourage stockier growth or to shorten overlong canes.
 
✓ Make cuts at a 45- to 60-degree angle about 
1⁄4 inch above a bud. The 
angle and proximity to a bud are important because the cut heals more 
quickly and sheds water away from the bud (see Figure 18-5).

✓ Cut to a bud that points away from the center of the bush. Imagine a 
V or vase shape with the center of the bush mostly free of stems and 
branches.

292
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
 As you prune, keep in mind that buds grow in the direction in which 
they point.
 
✓ Remove suckers that grow from the rootstock. Most roses consist of 
a scion of a desirable flowering variety grafted onto a rootstock of a 
more vigorous type of rose. Suckers often arise from this rootstock, 
and because they are more vigorous than the scion variety on top, they 
eventually crowd out the flowering rose. It’s easy to distinguish sucker 
growth, because the leaves and flowers look very different. Cut or pull 
them off below the soil line.
Pruning climbing roses
Roses with very long canes, called climbing roses (which I consider to be 
garden-type roses), offer a special challenge to rose growers because they 
have two different kinds of shoots: the main structural canes and the flowering 
shoots, called laterals, that grow from them. For the first two or three years 
after planting, allow the structural canes to grow with abandon, removing only 
dead or damaged canes. Tie them to a trellis or other support as desired.
Some climbing roses bloom just once, in the spring. The time to prune them 
is right after flowering, as you would for other garden roses.
Another kind of climbing rose, called everblooming, blooms throughout the 
summer, and these roses need a different pruning strategy. Tie their struc-
tural canes at a nearly horizontal angle to encourage them to sprout flower-
ing lateral branches. In the winter or early spring, when the plant is dormant, 
prune these laterals back to about two to three buds above the structural 
canes. These buds will grow vigorously and produce flowers. After blooming, 
remove the flowers as you would for other roses.
Preparing Roses for Winter
If you live where winter temperatures rarely dip much below 15 degrees 
Fahrenheit — USDA Zones 9 through 11 — you can skip this section. Just 
about any rose can handle typical winters in these zones without any special 
attention.
Zones 6 through 8 are transition zones for winter-hardiness. If you live in one 
of these areas, you can grow most any kind of rose, but the more tender ones 
may be damaged by some winters. Often, it’s not the absolute cold that does 
them in, but the wide temperature swings from cold to warm and back to 
cold again. That’s why gardeners in these zones are likely to take measures 
to protect their favorite plants.

293
 Chapter 18: Run for the Roses
If you live in Zone 5 or colder, expect the harshest winter cold and winds, and 
protect all but the hardiest of roses.
The bud union is the most cold-sensitive part of most rose plants. Covering 
the bud union with soil protects it from the cold. To prepare the bud union 
for winter, follow these steps:
 
1. Tie all the canes together to keep them from being windblown and 
loosening the soil around the base of the bush, or shorten the canes to 
reduce the effect of winds.
 
 Don’t cut the canes to soil level, though, because you want the buds 
near the bottom of the canes to sprout into new canes in the spring.
 
2. Mound soil 8 to 10 inches high around the base of canes after the first 
hard frost but while you can still work the soil.
 
 Bring soil from another part of the garden for mounding, because you 
may injure roots if you remove soil from around the rose plant or bed. 
Avoid using clay or heavy soils to build these mounds, because they 
hold too much moisture.
 
3. Pile hay, straw, horse manure, leaves, or similar loose material over 
the mounded canes.
 
 To prevent invasion by mice, wait until after the ground has frozen in 
late fall — around Thanksgiving in northern areas. Hold the material in 
place by covering it with some soil. These materials help keep the soil 
temperature constant. For additional protection, place twiggy branches 
or evergreen boughs over the top of the bushes. (I use limbs from my 
Christmas tree.) These branches help accumulate snow between the 
bushes, which may help reduce injury to the roots while still allowing 
some air circulation.
You can also make or buy cylinders, such as styrofoam cones, to place 
around your rosebushes, but these devices work only for small plants. Set 
the cylinders in place after two hard frosts have occurred — usually, after 
Thanksgiving. If you use an open-top cylinder, tie the rose plant’s canes 
together; put the cylinder in place; cut the canes even with the cylinder’s top; 
and then fill the cylinder with dry organic matter, such as leaves or straw. 
(Don’t use peat moss.) Cover the top with polyethylene film to keep the insu-
lation material dry, and anchor it in place to keep it from blowing over. Check 
the plants occasionally in winter for rodent, wind, and other damage.
Remove protective materials in spring as soon as the danger of hard frost 
passes but before new growth appears. Carefully remove the soil mounded 
around the bases of plants to avoid breaking off any shoots that may have 
started to grow. Never uncover the bushes in spring before the ground has 
thawed, because the tops may start to grow before the roots can provide 
water.

294
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
The most important thing you can do to help prevent winter injury is to keep 
your roses healthy during the growing season. Roses that were free of disease 
and properly nourished during the summer are less likely to suffer damage 
come winter.
Solving Common Rose Troubles
Choosing disease-resistant roses in the first place eliminates many common 
problems, but many of the most popular roses need intervention to keep 
them healthy. Show roses regularly fall prey to the common diseases, espe-
cially in climates with humid growing seasons. If you’re in a low-humidity 
region where summer rainfall is rare, you have the best chance of growing 
disease-free show roses without fungicides.
Rose diseases
Diseases that damage leaves look unsightly and prevent plants from making 
enough food to flower and grow robustly. The two most common rose diseases 
throughout most of the United States are black spot and powdery mildew. My 
observation from years of growing and watching roses is that the favorite show 
roses — dark red and richly scented — are more prone to powdery mildew 
than others. Similarly, roses with yellow flowers or yellow-flowered ancestors 
are also somewhat more subject to disease. Other common rose diseases 
include downy mildew, rust disease, and rose mosaic virus. You can find out 
more about plant diseases and control methods in Chapter 9.
Insect pests
Many insect pests feed on roses, but few cause really devastating harm. 
Vigilance and applying a strong blast of water or handpicking take care of 
most pests, such as common aphids, Japanese beetles, rose slugs, rose 
curculios, and caterpillars. Other common pests include spider mites, scale 
insects, and thrips. You can read more about insect pests and how to control 
them in Chapter 8.
 
Recognize the difference between your rose-garden friends and the pests. 
Don’t assume that any insect you spot in the garden is the perpetrator of some 
damage. Nothing could be further from the truth. Most of the insects you see 
in your garden are harmless; only a few cause damage. Some actually help!

T
rees and shrubs lend structure to the landscape; they form the frame-
work around which you plan your flower and vegetable gardens. As these 
long-lived plants mature, they become like old friends. Losing one to accident 
or disease leaves a hole in your landscape — a gap in the hedge. Taking care 
of these irreplaceable assets and using them to your best advantage starts 
with choosing the right plants in the first place, planting them correctly, and 
caring for them to keep them thriving.
Planning for Low Maintenance
I like to have a map in hand when I set out into unfamiliar territory. Knowing 
the lay of the land — what to expect around the next bend in the road — 
saves me missteps, as well as valuable time and energy. Using a map of your 
yard works the same way when you’re choosing the best trees and shrubs. 
Miss a turn, and you may not get where you intended to go. In Chapter 3, I 
talk about how to assess your growing conditions. That chapter is a good 
reference as you browse through this one.

296
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Putting everything in its place
When they’re happy, trees and shrubs live for a long time and suffer few 
problems. Even before you begin shopping for these long-term landscape 
investments, assess the conditions of your planting site and use this 
assessment to narrow the list of potential plants to those that thrive in your 
particular situation.
 
One aspect that many people fail to consider when placing trees and shrubs in 
their landscapes is the plants’ mature size. Most of these woody plants grow 
so slowly that it’s easy to forget that the spindly twig you planted by the mail-
box will grow wide enough to divert traffic within a few years. Play it safe by 
spacing trees where they can grow to full size without overhanging buildings 
and roads, growing into utility wires, or crowding the house. Choose shrubs 
that won’t cover the windows or sidewalk. If the space between your small, 
newly planted shrubs looks too bleak and barren, plant some colorful annual 
or perennial flowers in the gaps until the shrubs fill in.
Avoiding troublemakers
Buying trees is like entering into any other long-term relationship: The char-
acteristics that attracted you in the first place may lose their appeal in time if 
the bad habits outweigh the good ones. When you choose trees and shrubs for 
your landscape, consider the attributes that you want your plants to have. It’s 
easy to focus on color, texture, shape, and flowers, but keep other factors in 
mind too. If you want a shade tree to plant in the lawn, look for deeply rooted, 
long-lived species. No time for raking? Stay away from trees that drop copious 
twigs and leaves. Following are some notorious troublemakers:
 
✓ Invasive roots wreak havoc in septic fields and often grow close to 
the soil surface, making lawn mowing difficult. Trees to avoid in lawns 
include red and silver maples, box elders, birches, beeches, Ficus 
species, poplars, and willows.
 
✓ Weak-wooded trees frequently break under ice and wind stress, causing 
property damage. Home wreckers include red and silver maples, box 
elders, horse chestnuts, Catalpa species, Eucalyptus species, poplars, 
and willows.
 
✓ Messy trees drop leaves, sap, fruits, nuts, and twigs frequently, 
adding to yard maintenance. Species to avoid include box elders, oaks, 
walnuts and other nut-bearing trees, Catalpa species, sweetgums, pines, 
magnolias, and plane trees and sycamores.
If you space them to allow some of these troublesome trees to grow without 
endangering or inconveniencing you, by all means plant them. They do have 
some endearing traits. But it pays to be forewarned. Find out as much as you 

297
 Chapter 19: Managing Landscape Trees and Shrubs
can about a species before you buy, and choose varieties that offer disease 
resistance, if available. I mention disease-resistant varieties in the plant 
descriptions in this chapter.
Planting for Success
How you plant your tree or shrub may determine whether it thrives, merely 
survives, or dies. Not long ago, a neighbor asked me to look at a young 
crabapple tree that he planted several years earlier. It wasn’t growing well and 
looked a little sadder each year. After digging around the trunk a bit, I discovered 
that he had planted it about 6 inches too deep — the tree was suffocating! 
We replanted that tree, and now it’s blooming reliably every spring. Those 6 
inches seem like such a small thing, yet they meant life or death for that tree. 
Read the following sections to get your plants off to the best possible start.
There is a season . . .
The best time of year to plant trees and shrubs depends mostly on your 
climate and the type of plant you’re installing. Newly transplanted trees 
and shrubs have small root systems that need time to grow before they can 
support lots of leafy twigs and flowers. Identify your climate to find the best 
planting times for your trees and shrubs:
 
✓ Cool, rainy winters: Plant in autumn at the beginning of the rainy 
season to take advantage of the natural moisture.
 
✓ Freezing, snowy winters: Plant in early spring as soon as the ground 
thaws or in late summer to early autumn. Roots continue to grow until 
the ground temperature approaches 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
✓ Warm year-round: Plant at the beginning of the coolest, wettest season.
Deciduous and evergreen plants have somewhat different needs in the 
months following transplanting, which can affect the best time to plant in 
your area:
 
✓ Deciduous: Plant when the trees have an opportunity to grow roots 
without the added stress of leaves — usually, early autumn to spring.
 
✓ Evergreen: These plants lose water through their leaves year-round but 
can’t take up water through their roots when the ground is frozen. Avoid 
planting just before winter in cold climates.
Nurseries sell woody plants in three ways: in containers, bare root, and 
balled and burlapped. Consult Chapter 12 for details on planting trees in 
these different forms.

298
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Picking out healthy plants
My mantra throughout this book is prevention, prevention, prevention. 
One of the first steps to low-maintenance, problem-free trees and shrubs 
is picking out healthy specimens. Refer to Chapter 12 for tips on choosing 
healthy plants in general. Here are a few tips specific to trees:
 
✓ Mechanical damage: A few broken twigs usually aren’t reasons to reject 
a plant, but avoid those with gashes on the trunk and main limbs, as well 
as any with torn limbs. Balled and burlapped (B&B) plants should have a 
solid, unbroken root ball, which indicates intact roots.
 
✓ Branch and trunk structure: Look for trees with straight, evenly tapered 
trunks and evenly distributed limbs. Unless the tree is supposed to have 
several trunks or large main branches, such as ornamental cherries 
and crabapples, choose trees with a single main trunk that doesn’t fork. 
Avoid trees with crowded or lopsided branches. Trees (such as birches) 
that are sold in clumps should have similar-size trunks that don’t rub 
against one another; the trees will become larger and more crowded as 
they grow. Figure 19-1 compares trees with good and poor structure.

299
 Chapter 19: Managing Landscape Trees and Shrubs
Shrubs vary considerably from species to species; desirable structure in one 
may be undesirable in another. In general, choose shrubs with symmetrical 
branches that don’t rub against one another. Avoid shrubs with roots 
growing on the surface or out of the drainage holes of their pots.
Long-Term Care for Landscape 
Trees and Shrubs
Established trees and shrubs need less attention than just about any 
other landscape plants. Except in unusual circumstances, they rarely need 
watering. They need little fertilizer. All they ask for are observation for 
potential problems and occasional pruning to keep them healthy and 
respectable-looking.
Fertilizing follies
Unless your soil is unusually infertile or you want your trees to grow extra 
fast, you don’t need to fertilize them regularly. If you do choose to fertilize, 
don’t apply more than 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet per year. 
(Never add it to the hole at planting time, however.) You can apply organic 
granular fertilizer or spread composed manure over the root zone. The root 
zone, where the roots grow, usually is at least twice as wide as the branch 
spread. If the branches measure 10 feet from trunk to tips, figure that the 
roots stretch about 20 feet. To calculate the square feet in the root zone, use 
this formula: 3.14 × (root radius) × (root radius). In this case, 3.14 × 20 × 20 = 
1,256 square feet. See Chapter 6 for more on using organic fertilizers.
Pruning 101
You need a good reason to prune a twig or remove a limb from a tree or 
shrub; every time you cut into a plant, you open a wound that’s vulnerable 
to disease. Having a goal in mind helps guide you toward making the right 
cuts and minimizes the size and number of cuts you need to make. Common 
reasons to prune include the following:
 
✓ Removing dead, damaged, and diseased wood: Prune any time you see 
these three Ds to prevent the damage or disease from spreading. If the 
trunk or major limbs are affected, call an arborist for help.

300
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Establishing healthy structure: Removing poorly placed, crowded limbs 
when they’re small prevents major pruning cuts down the road. Limbs 
that rub against one another, emerge too close together from the trunk, 
or have very narrow crotch angles where the limb meets the trunk are 
all candidates for removal.
 
✓ Controlling growth: Part of your annual yard maintenance includes 
shaping shrubs that grow out of bounds, removing old and unproductive 
shoots, and trimming limbs that get in the way.
 
✓ Increasing flowers: Fruiting and ornamental flowering trees and shrubs 
produce more flowers and better-quality fruit when pruned properly. As 
a rule, prune spring-flowering shrubs right after they finish blooming. 
Prune summer-blooming shrubs and most trees when they’re dormant 
in the winter.
The tools you need to do a good pruning job include hand pruners for cuts 
up to 
3⁄4 inch in diameter, and loppers for cuts between 
3⁄4 inch and 1
1⁄2 inches 
in diameter or for limbs that are just out of arm’s reach. Use a pruning saw 
with a curved 8- to 12-inch blade for larger cuts. To prevent the spread of 
disease, always clean your tool blades with isopropyl alcohol between 
prunings of trees and shrubs. Don’t coat the wounds with paint, tar, or any 
other material; it actually slows the healing process.
 
If the pruning job is too high to reach from the ground, use a pole pruner with 
a telescoping handle, or call a professional. Never climb a tree when using 
power equipment (such as a chain saw), and never cut limbs near utility wires.
You need to know only two basic pruning cuts to maintain your trees, shrubs, 
and flowering plants: thinning and heading.
 
✓ Thinning cut: A thinning cut removes a branch back to its origin, as 
shown on the left in Figure 19-2. Use thinning cuts to maintain plants’ 
natural appearance while decreasing their height, width, or branching 
density.
 
✓ Heading cut: A heading cut, shown on the right in Figure 19-2, removes 
shoots or branches back to buds. Plants usually respond to heading 
cuts by sprouting new shoots near the pruning site, resulting in denser 
growth. Deadheading, a technique used to remove spent flowers, helps 
increase future flowering. Pinch or prune off the flowers to a point just 
above healthy-looking buds.

When you make a thinning cut, it’s really important to cut at the right place. 
If you look closely where a branch joins the trunk or a larger limb, you should 
see a series of raised ridges, called the branch collar. That’s where the scar 
tissue begins to form when the limb dies or is removed. Make your cut just 
outside that collar without leaving a stub. Stubs invite infection that may lead 
to the death of the tree. Never cut a limb flush with the trunk, either. And 
always support the limb you’re removing to avoid tearing the bark on the 
trunk.
Choosing the Perfect Trees and Shrubs
When you choose new trees and shrubs, think about what you want these 
plants to do in your landscape. Do you need shade or shelter from the wind? 
Does a corner of the yard need a spark of color? Consider all the seasons of the 
year when you make your decision; the best shrubs and trees have practical or 
decorative value in several seasons, not just one. A Japanese maple, for exam-
ple, may have ornamental leaves in spring and summer, colorful fall foliage, 
and interesting branching patterns and bark in the winter. I’ve chosen some 
of the best and most versatile landscape trees and shrubs for this section.

302
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
If you want to know more about flowering and shade trees, shrubs, and conifers, 
and how to care for them, pick up a copy of Trees & Shrubs For Dummies 
(Wiley). The book also lists many of the most attractive and disease- and 
pest-resistant varieties of each tree and shrub.
Shade trees
Shade trees frame the landscape, cool the space around them, and provide 
a backdrop for colorful flowering trees and shrubs. Most of these trees grow 
too tall for you to treat for pests or diseases, so if you’re planting new trees, 
your best bet is to choose species that suffer few problems in the first place. 
If you already have large shade trees with chronic pests, or if you suspect 
disease, call an arborist who can diagnose the trouble and offer advice and 
treatment.
 
✓ Maple (Acer species): A large and diverse group of valuable landscape 
trees, maples range in mature size from 20 to 100 feet, depending on 
species. The larger species serve as shade trees; smaller ones make 
good specimens and street trees. Many maples are renowned for their 
brilliant autumn foliage; some also have attractive bark.
 
 Maples that grow 25 to 30 feet high include trident (A. buergeranum), 
hedge (A. campestre), fullmoon (A. japonicum), Japanese (A. palmatum), 
Amur (A. tataricum), and Shantung (A. truncatum). All have yellow, orange, 
or crimson fall foliage. Larger species for shade include paperbark (A. 
griseum), red (A. rubrum; note this tree’s bad habits in “Avoiding trouble-
makers,” earlier in this chapter), and sugar (A. saccharum) maples.
 
 Most maples prefer well-drained, fertile soil and regular moisture. Some 
maples, including hedge and trident, tolerate drier and less fertile soil, 
such as occurs near roads. For damp soil, try red or Amur maples. 
Prune only to remove dead, damaged, or diseased limbs, or any that 
rub or hang over buildings. Prune in early summer, avoiding late winter 
through spring, when pruning cuts will bleed sap profusely.
 
 Leaf spots, cankers, caterpillars, borers, leafhoppers, and scale insects 
injure maples, especially those growing in stressed conditions or in 
unsuitable soils. Some species are also more prone to insects, disease, 
and structural damage than others, including box elder (A. negundo), 
silver (A. saccharinum), and sycamore (A. pseudoplatanus) maples. In 
hot, dry climates, look for brown leaf edges that signal leaf scorch. Give 
additional water to moisten the soil to a depth of at least 12 inches.

 Chapter 19: Managing Landscape Trees and Shrubs
 
✓ Birch (Betula species): When you think of birches, you likely picture a 
clump of white-barked trees. Not all birches have white bark, however. 
Many actually make better landscape specimens, especially for organic 
gardeners, because they resist the most common and devastating 
pest — the bronze birch borer — and tolerate a wider range of growing 
conditions.
 
 Birches cast light shade, making them good choices for cooling a shady 
seat. Most birches thrive in moist, well-drained, acidic soils, but try 
gray birch in drier situations and river birch in damp soil. Prune birches 
in late spring to early summer after the leaves have fully emerged. If 
pruned too early or late in the season, they bleed sap excessively. Avoid 
disturbing the soil around their shallow roots.
 
 Birches are subject to attack from many insects and several diseases, 
including leaf miners, canker, and leaf diseases. The bronze birch 
borer decimates the white-barked birches, especially the European 
white birch throughout the eastern and midwestern United States, 
targeting stressed trees and older specimens first. The first symptoms 
of infestation are dead branches near the top of the tree.
 
 Choose species that resist the bronze birch borer, such as Asian white 
(B. platyphylla japonica), gray (B. populifolia), and river (B. nigra) 
birches. If the pest is not a problem in your area, try white-barked paper 
(B. papyrifera) and European white (B. pendula) birches. All these 
birches are hardy in Zones 3 to 6 except Asian white birch, which grows 
north to Zone 4, and river birch, which grows south to Zone 9.
 
✓ Hackberry (Celtis species): These native North American species thrive 
in adverse conditions, tolerating wet to dry soil and urban to open prairie 
situations. They grow 40 to 60 feet tall and form an elmlike silhouette. 
Common hackberry (C. occidentalis) grows in Zones 3 to 9, tolerates 
midwestern wind and dry soil, and has wildlife-attracting berries. Sugar 
hackberry (C. laevigata) grows in Zones 5 to 9, prefers low wet areas, 
has smooth gray bark, and resists some common hackberry diseases.
 
 Common hackberry is prone to a disfiguring disease called witches’ 
broom that makes the twigs grow abnormally. The cultivar Prairie 
Pride resists the disease. Other problems include leaf spots and galls. 
Mourning cloak butterfly larvae enjoy its foliage.
 
✓ Ginkgo (Gingko biloba): Growing 50 to 80 feet tall and 30 to 40 feet 
wide, ginkgo is best suited to large yards. Young trees have a pyramid 
shape, but older trees become widely spreading. Varieties also differ 
significantly in width and shape. Ginkgo’s pollution tolerance and neat 
habits make it attractive for planting along streets, in parks, and in other 
urban and suburban areas.

304
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
 Not fussy about soil, the gingko thrives in Zones 4 to 8. It needs little 
care and has no significant pests or diseases. Choose a male cultivar 
such as Autumn Gold, Fairmount, or Princeton Sentry to avoid the 
unpleasant-smelling fruits that drop from female trees.
 
✓ Katsura (Cercidiphyllum japonicus): This tree has so many good 
things going for it that’s it hard to go wrong by choosing it for your 
yard — as long as you have the space to accommodate it. It grows 40 to 
60 feet high and spreads just as wide from several branched trunks. The 
nearly round leaves are attractive from spring to their final fall blaze of 
apricot-orange.
 
 Katsura prefers moist, slightly acidic, well-drained, fertile soil and full 
sun. Keep the soil moist but not saturated for the first few years after 
transplanting. Mulch to hold soil moisture. The species has no significant 
pests or diseases. For something different, look for the cultivar Pendula, 
which grows cascading limbs that reach 15 to 25 feet high with a wider 
spread.
 
✓ Oak (Quercus species): The queen of trees, oaks suggest majesty 
wherever they grow. Oak species fall into three broad categories:
 
• White oaks have leaves with rounded lobes and grow 80 feet 
high — too large for most home landscapes.
 
• Red oaks have leaves with pointed lobes and make better 
landscape specimens.
 
• Narrow-leafed oaks don’t have lobed leaves, and many are 
suitable for home landscapes.
 
 Plant dormant, balled and burlapped, or container-grown specimens in 
well-drained soil. Pin oak (Q. palustris) and swamp white oak (Q. bicolor) 
can grow in wet soils. Preferred soil pH varies widely. Pin oak is especially 
sensitive to high pH soils, and the leaves will turn yellow if the soil isn’t 
acidic.
 
 Oaks suffer from many insect pests that eat their leaves — including 
gypsy moths, oak moths, mites, and borers — plus various fungus 
diseases. Few pests prove fatal to otherwise-healthy trees.
Other shade trees to consider are ash (Fraxinus spp.), beech (Fagus spp.), 
black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), Chinese pistache (Pistacia chinensis), hickory 
(Carya spp.), Japanese zelkova (Zelkova serrata), Kentucky coffeetree 
(Gymnocladus dioicus), lacebark elm (Ulmus parvifolia), linden (Tilia spp.), 
and yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea).

Flowering and ornamental trees
Flowering trees give your yard a colorful exclamation point whenever they 
bloom. The anticipation of cherry or crabapple blossoms marks the changing 
of the seasons, often highlighting the start of the gardening season.
 
✓ Serviceberry (Amelanchier species): These trees grow about 20 feet 
high in Zones 3 to 7 and often form multiple-trunked trees with silvery 
bark. In spring, they produce clouds of white flowers, which ripen 
to delicious deep red to black fruits similar to blueberries by early 
summer. Their glossy, deep green, oval foliage turns brilliant yellow to 
orange in the fall. They have a few diseases, such as leaf spots and rust, 
and though insects pester them, no pests are serious. Plant in moist, 
acidic soils.
 
✓ Redbud (Cercis canadensis): Although hardy in Zones 5 to 9, individual 
trees may have a much narrower range, depending on where their fore-
bearers grew. If possible, choose trees from a similar climate to your 
own. Trees grow up to 25 feet tall and tend to form wide-spreading, 
multiple-trunked canopies. Leaves are heart-shaped and follow the pink 
early-spring flowers. Plant in moist, well-drained soil and full sun to light 
shade. Canker disease is the only serious problem; prune infected limbs.
 
 Varieties with unusual foliage include Forest Pansy, which grows in 
Zones 6 to 9 and has dark purple new leaves that mature to deep 
burgundy; and Silver Cloud, which has creamy-white, variegated leaves. 
Other varieties have flower colors ranging from white to reddish purple.
 
✓ Dogwood (Cornus species): Distinctive horizontal branching, clouds of 
spring flowers, and fiery autumn foliage make this group of landscape 
trees well loved. The most commonly planted species is flowering 
dogwood (C. florida), which is hardy in Zones 5 to 9.
 
 Many good varieties exist, including Cherokee Princess, which is very 
cold-hardy and disease-resistant. Another underappreciated species is 
kousa dogwood (C. kousa), which grows in similar conditions but stays 
smaller and blooms later than flowering dogwood, and is more resistant 
to anthracnose disease.
 
 Plant dogwoods in well-drained, moist, humus-rich soil. In hot climates, 
give midday shade. Canker, twig blights, anthracnose, and wood-boring 
insects frequently damage these trees. Prune out diseased wood when 
you see it. Dogwood is also prone to rot diseases if the bark is damaged — 
take care with the mower and string trimmer!

306
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Hawthorn (Crataegus species): This group of trees tolerates urban 
pollution and poor, dry soil; in return, it offers clouds of spring bloom, 
followed by crabapplelike fruits. Most have thorny branches and grow in 
Zones 4 to 7 or 8. Fire blight, leaf rust, blights and spots, apple scab, leaf 
miners, and aphids plague hawthorns. A few varieties — such as green 
hawthorn (C. viridis), Lavalle hawthorn (C. x lavellei), and English haw-
thorn Crimson Cloud (C. laevigata) — are more resistant to leaf diseases.
 
✓ Magnolia (Magnolia species): Ranging in size from shrubs to magnificent 
trees, magnolias include both evergreen and deciduous species. Some 
grow only in warmer climates from Zones 6 to 9; others tolerate Zone 
5 and even Zone 4. Magnolias prefer moist, well-drained, slightly acidic 
soil with plenty of organic matter and full sun to light shade. Protect 
the shallow roots from drought and weed competition with a layer of 
organic mulch. Prune only to shape the tree and remove undesirable 
limbs. Magnolias as a group suffer from few pests or diseases except 
for saucer magnolia (M. x soulangiana), which is prone to several leaf 
diseases.
 
 For shrub to small tree-size magnolias, look for lily magnolia (M. liliiflora); 
any of the Kosar-DeVos hybrids, such as Ann or Betty; sweetbay (M. 
virginiana); and star magnolia (M. stellata). Species that grow up to 30 
feet tall include Yulan (M. denudata), Loebner (M. x loebneri), and many 
hybrids.
 
✓ Flowering crabapple (Malus species): One of the most widely grown 
flowering trees in Zones 4 to 7 for home and public landscapes, flower-
ing crabapples have a lot to offer. Spring bloom, persistent and colorful 
fruit, and attractive branching and bark make them justifiably popular. 
Hundreds of varieties are available, and many of the newest ones have 
built-in disease resistance. Plant in nearly any well-drained, moderately 
fertile soil and full sun. Prevent weed and grass competition with 
organic mulch. Prune while dormant, in late winter to early spring.
 
 Choose the best varieties by first looking at disease resistance. 
Crabapples suffer from many serious diseases, including leaf scab, 
cedar-apple rust, powdery mildew, and fire blight. Expect aphids, mites, 
caterpillars, rodents, and deer to take a bite too.
 
 After selecting disease-resistant cultivars, select for flower color (white 
to deep pink), height and growth shape (column to wide and low), leaf 
color (green to reddish), and fruit size and color (red to yellow).
 
✓ Stewartia (Stewartia species): If you have moist, well-drained, acidic 
soil, consider stewartia for its flaky, mottled bark; late-summer bloom; 
and striking fall foliage. Trees stay 20 to 40 feet tall, making them ideal 
for most home landscapes. They suffer from few pests or diseases and 
need little pruning.

307
 Chapter 19: Managing Landscape Trees and Shrubs
Other small, ornamental trees include white fringetree (Chionanthus virginicus), 
goldenrain tree (Koelreuteria paniculata), purple-leaf plum (Prunus cerasifera), 
red buckeye (Aesculus pavia), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), and silverbell 
(Halesia carolina).
Flowering and ornamental shrubs
The seasonal stars of the show, flowering shrubs light up the landscape with 
drifts and spots of bloom. The best shrubs, however, offer more than a week 
or two of flowers; attractive foliage, stems, and colorful berries can carry the 
show through the rest of the year.
 
✓ Summersweet (Clethra alnifoli): This North American native offers 
spikes of fragrant, white to pink, late-summer flowers that attract 
butterflies and many other pollinating insects. It grows 6 to 10 feet tall 
and wide, but the award-winning cultivar Hummingbird grows only 36 
inches high. It grows in Zones 4 to 9 and prefers moist, acidic soil and 
part shade to full sun but tolerates less hospitable seashore conditions. 
It has few pests except for mites in overly dry sites. Prune to maintain 
shape and to remove spent flowers.
 
✓ Cotoneaster (Cotoneaster species): Deciduous members of this 
group have small leaves; attractive fruits; and distinctive, herringbone-
patterned branches. Some, such as spreading cotoneaster (C. divaricatus), 
grow upright to 5 or 6 feet, but most species remain under 3 feet tall. 
Creeping (C. adpressus), cranberry (C. apiculatus), and rockspray 
cotoneaster (C. horizontalis) spread up 6 feet wide, making them useful 
as ground covers.
 
 Plant cotoneasters in nearly any well-drained soil, including sandy, 
heavy clay, drought-prone, salty, and high- or low-pH soil. Prune to 
shape or remove damaged limbs. Pest and disease problems include fire 
blight, leaf spots, canker, and spider mites.
 
✓ Forsythia (Forsythia species): Cheerful, yellow, bell-shaped flowers 
welcome spring, but the shrubs frequently become straggly and over-
grown unless pruned regularly. Prune after flowering in the spring, 
choosing one-fourth of the oldest stems and cutting them right to the 
ground. To ensure consistent flowering in the most northern parts of 
its Zone 4 to 8 range, choose hardy varieties, including Northern Sun, 
Northern Gold, and Meadowlark. Plant in nearly any soil in full sun. 
Although several species of insects attack forsythia, none is serious. 
Prune out twigs that die back.

308
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Hydrangea (Hydrangea species): Popular for its huge balls of white, 
pink, and blue flowers, this group of shrubs grows in nearly any soil 
and sun conditions. Most varieties prefer some midday shade in hot 
climates, however. As a rule, hydrangeas are tough as nails, although 
some are prone to powdery mildew in humid climates, and aphids, 
mites, and scale can cause some damage. Prune smooth hydrangea (H. 
arborescens) and panicle or PeeGee hydrangea (H. paniculata) in late 
winter or spring because they bloom on new growth. Bigleaf or French 
hydrangea (H. macrophylla) and oakleaf hydrangea (H. quercifolia), 
however, bloom on last year’s wood, so prune them right after they 
bloom in the summer, and avoid spring pruning.
 
✓ Holly (Ilex species): This huge group of mostly evergreen trees and 
shrubs includes everything from the classic English holly (I. aquifolium) 
to the less-well-known inkberry (I. glabra) and hundreds of species and 
varieties in between. Hardiness ranges from inkberry’s span of Zones 4 
to 9 to the tender Chinese holly (I. cornuta), which prefers Zones 7 to 9. 
Most hollies produce large crops of attractive, persistent berries, but 
most species bear male and female flowers on separate plants. Plant 
at least one of each species if you want berries, and look at the plant 
names for clues about the sex of the shrub. Blue Boy and Blue Girl make 
good companions, as do China Boy and China Girl.
 
 Hollies in general enjoy moist, well-drained soil and full sun, although 
Chinese holly withstands drought and flooding with aplomb. In windy 
areas and climates where the soil freezes, protect the foliage from 
drying out by covering with burlap or other windbreak material. Hollies 
suffer from many pests and diseases, including scales, spider mites, 
nematodes, leaf miners, and various bugs and caterpillars, as well as 
mildew and leaf spots. The most problem-free species include Yaupon (I. 
vomitoria), inkberry, and the Foster hybrids.
 
 Winterberry (I. Verticillata), one of my favorite hollies, grows in Zones 3 
to 9. It loses its leaves in winter but retains the characteristic masses of 
red berries. Winterberry has few pests or disease problems.
 
✓ Spirea (Spirea species): These easygoing shrubs are useful for informal 
hedges, foundation plantings, and mixed shrub borders. Most have flat 
clusters of little white to pink flowers; some, such as Magic Carpet and 
Goldflame, even offer three seasons of interest with their brilliant yellow 
foliage, floral display, and autumn color. Plant in any well-drained soil, 
and give them full sun and regular watering in dry spells.
 
 Spireas come under attack from many pests and diseases, but these 
attacks rarely prove to be fatal. After flowering, cut the weakest or 
oldest one-fourth of the shoots to the ground each year to keep shrubs 
vigorous and tidy.

309
 Chapter 19: Managing Landscape Trees and Shrubs
 
✓ Lilac (Syringa species): If you give your lilac moist, fertile soil and full 
sun, and prune it to remove spent flowers and weak growth, you can 
expect it to live for many years. Varieties now exist that can grow in 
any zone from 3 to 9. Major problems include lilac borer, scale insects, 
lilac blight, and powdery mildew. The common lilac (S. vulgaris) offers 
the widest range of flower colors, from white to pink and blue to deep 
purple. Some varieties have double flowers or extra fragrance. Meyer 
lilac (S. meyeri) and Manchurian lilac (S. patula) Miss Kim stay smaller 
than the common species. Japanese tree lilac (S. reticulata) grows 20 to 
30 feet tall and has white blooms in June.
 
✓ Viburnum (Viburnum species): This diverse group shares the attribute 
of profuse flowering; some, such as Korean spice viburnum (V. carlesii) 
and fragrant viburnum (V. x carlcephalum), have intoxicatingly fragrant 
flowers. Many also produce attractive berries, although with some 
species, such as Korean spice viburnum, you have to plant both male 
and female shrubs. Birds appreciate some native species for food. Most 
of these shrubs grow in any well-drained but moisture-retentive soil. 
Some prefer acidic soil; others are less fussy. Full sun to part shade suits 
them fine, depending on the species and climate.
 
 Species that grow in dry soils include wayfaring tree (V. lantana), arrow-
wood viburnum (V. dentatum), and blackhaw viburnum (V. prunifolium). 
Few pests or diseases cause serious damage.
Other shrubs to consider include azaleas and rhododendrons (Rhododendron 
spp.species), mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), red-osier dogwood (Cornus 
sericea), and Virginia sweetspire (Itea virginica).
Conifers
Needle- and cone-bearing trees and shrubs, called conifers, provide the 
backdrop for more colorful garden elements and serve as hedges, screens, 
and windbreaks. Their imposing size and stiff formality make many evergreen 
trees difficult to integrate into small home landscapes. Think twice before 
planting a potentially 50-foot-tall Colorado blue spruce in your front yard! In 
larger settings, where the trees can attain full size, evergreen trees add 
grandeur and provide refuge for wildlife.
Shrub-size conifers are invaluable for the year-round color and texture they 
add to the landscape. Some creep over the ground and drape over walls; 
others grow into neat cones, pyramids, and rounded cushions. Foliage colors 
range from gold through a wide range of greens to silver and even purplish. 
Some plants appear fuzzy and soft; others are stiff and bristly.

310
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
Although you can shape many conifers into geometric and fanciful forms, 
most don’t require pruning at all except to remove dead, diseased, or damaged 
limbs and undesirable growth that detracts from the plant’s appearance. In 
fact, pine, spruce, and fir trees that grow in whorls (with layers of branches 
around the trunk) will not sprout new limbs in response to pruning. To control 
their growth, pinch or prune their new, soft growth in late spring before it 
hardens, cutting into only the new tissue. Arborvitae, false cypress, cypress, 
juniper, and yew plants with random branching can tolerate more pruning, 
however, and usually will sprout new limbs to replace the ones that you 
remove. Conifers that usually grow into a pyramid shape with one central 
trunk sometimes develop additional leaders (competing main trunks) at the 
top of the tree. Remove all but one leader to retain the tree shape.
As a group, conifers suffer from their share of pests and diseases. The most 
troublesome pests include spruce budworm, bagworms, and various cater-
pillars. Bacterial and fungal diseases cause blights, cankers, and root rots. 
See Part III for more information about these pests and diseases. The best 
defense against disease is to plant your trees and shrubs in the soil and sun 
conditions they prefer, and keep them growing strong. Protect evergreens 
from drying winter winds wherever the ground freezes.
 
✓ Fir (Abies species): Imagine the perfect Christmas tree, and you 
probably picture a fir. Firs have short, bristly needles and a pyramid 
shape. Although popular for home landscapes, balsam (A. balsamea), 
white or concolor (A. concolor), and frasier (A. fraseri) firs grow 30 to 
more than 40 feet tall and spread 25 feet or more at their bases when 
mature. Use as windbreaks, or plant as groups in large areas. Firs prefer 
cool, moist, acidic soils and don’t readily tolerate dry, alkaline soil. 
They require no pruning except to remove damaged limbs. Insect pests 
include spruce budworms, bagworms, spider mites, and scales. Diseases 
include leaf and twig blights and rust fungus.
 
✓ Cypress and false cypress (Cupressocyparis and Chamaecyparis 
species): These two closely related groups share many features 
but differ in their preferred growing conditions. False cypress 
(Chamaecyparis) prefers cool, moist, humid conditions; cypress 
(Cupressocyparis) enjoys the heat and drier soil found in more arid 
climates. The hybrid between the two groups, Leyland cypress, tolerates 
a wider range of soils and climates than either of its parents. Cypresses 
have flat, scalelike foliage that’s compressed against the twigs, giving 
the branches stringy or fanlike textures.
 
 Hundreds of varieties are available, including low-growing shrubs to 
stately trees. Leyland cypress is used widely for hedges because it 
grows up to 3 feet per year and tolerates salt spray and any soil except 
poorly drained. Hinoki (C. obtusa) and threadleaf (C. pisifera) false 
cypresses have many popular varieties used in home and commercial 
landscapes. Cypresses require no pruning except to shape the plant or 
remove damaged limbs. Bagworms are the only troublesome pests. Twig 
blight occurs in some areas but isn’t prevalent.

311
 Chapter 19: Managing Landscape Trees and Shrubs
 
✓ Juniper (Juniperus species): Versatile and tough as nails, junipers are 
justifiably among the most popular landscape shrubs. They tolerate poor, 
dry soil, as well as urban and roadside conditions; they come in a seem-
ingly infinite number of shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. Depending 
on the species and variety, you can find a juniper to grow in any climate 
from coastal Florida to the Canadian plains. Ground-hugging forms make 
excellent carpets for slopes and lawn substitutes. Taller varieties serve 
as shrubs for hedges and planting around buildings.
 
 In cold-winter Zone 3 or 4, and warmer, look for Chinese (J. chinensis, 
J. x media), creeping (J. horizontalis), savin (J. sabina), and Rocky 
Mountain (J. scopulorum) juniper varieties. Shore juniper (J. conferta) 
enjoys the heat in Zones 6 to 9 and tolerates coastal conditions.
 
 Junipers can suffer from several insect pests and diseases, including 
bagworms, scales, webworms, borers, twig blight, and cedar-apple rust. 
Creeping juniper is more disease-prone than others, but savin juniper 
varieties Calgary Carpet, Arcadia, Scandia, Blue Danube, and Broadmoor 
resist juniper blight. In wet, poorly drained soils, junipers are prone to 
root rot.
 
✓ Spruce (Picea species): Give spruce trees plenty of room if you plant 
them in your landscape, because they tend to spread widely at the base 
as they mature, often measuring 20 feet or more across at the ground. 
Most spruce have a stiff, formal pyramid shape, which looks best in 
large landscapes or when the trees grow in groups. Use for windbreaks 
or large screens.
 
 A few dwarf varieties are available; they grow into small mounds or 
weeping specimens suitable for planting in home landscapes. For dwarf 
varieties, look for Norway (Picea abies), Little Gem, Pumila, Nidiformis, 
or Bird’s Nest Spruce; black (P. mariana) Nana; or white spruce (P. 
glauca) Conica, also known as Dwarf Alberta Spruce.
 
 Spruces prefer cool climates and well-drained but moderately moist soil. 
Avoid planting them in dry soil and polluted urban locations. They often 
suffer from aphids, spruce budworms, bagworms, and other pests, as 
well as canker and twig blight.
 
✓ Pine (Pinus species): Most pines grow into large, picturesque trees up 
to 100 feet tall, but a few dwarf varieties stay small enough to serve in 
home landscapes. For small pines, seek out Japanese red pine (Pinus 
densiflora) Umbraculifera, Japanese white pine (P. parviflora) Glauca, 
Japanese black pine (P. thunbergii), and mugo pine (P. mugo).
 
 Pines have long needles that give them a softer texture than most other 
conifers. The needles occur in bundles of two, three, or five. Pines with 
the same number of needles in a bundle often have other common 
characteristics, such as growth habits and cultural requirements. Two-
needled pines, such as Scotch pine (P. sylvestris), for example, tolerate 
drier soil and more heat than the five-needled species, such as white pine 
(P. strobus).

312
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
 Pines don’t tolerate air pollution or road-salt spray. Common diseases 
and pests include white pine blister rust, spruce budworms, and white 
pine weevils.
 
✓ Yew (Taxus species): Yews, among the most widely grown conifers for 
hedges and shearing into fanciful shapes, respond to pruning by sprout-
ing ever-denser growth. Keep in mind that most yews will grow into 
30- to 60-foot trees if allowed to do so. They grow best in well-drained, 
fertile, moist soil and full sun to part shade, and may need protection 
from the winter wind in cold climates.
 
 In hot, muggy climates, look for the variety Tauntonii, which tolerates 
the summer heat better than most other yews. Pests include deer, 
weevils, and mealybugs, as well as blights and root rot.
 
✓ Arborvitae and white cedar (Thuja and Platycladus species): These 
tough trees and shrubs grow in a wide range of soils and climates, from 
soggy to well drained, in Zones 3 to 11. They need full sun to grow lush 
and full. Few pests or diseases cause them serious trouble, although 
bagworms, spider mites, blight, and canker can show up when plants are 
stressed. Protect them from road-salt spray and drying winter winds.
 
 As trees, arborvitae grow up to 50 feet high, but many varieties stay 
shrub-sized and come in many shapes, including globe, cone, column, 
pyramid, and weeping. Some have yellowish foliage; others have deep 
green foliage. Choose a variety that matches your climate, soil, and 
specific landscape needs. Arborvitae make a classic tall hedge without 
shearing, and smaller varieties are suitable for planting around buildings.

M
any people think that to have an attractive lawn, they have to 
douse it with herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. That, of course, 
is a fallacy. It’s possible — and even easy — to grow a great-looking lawn 
organically. An organic lawn-care program requires an attitude adjustment, 
however. The secret is to think of your lawn as a mixed garden of grass and 
other compatible, low-growing plants that tolerate mowing. 
As in any other kind of gardening, your success depends on how well you 
lay the groundwork by preparing the soil, choosing the right grass varieties, 
and giving the plants what they need. This chapter explains what you need to 
know about your lawn’s growth habits, fertilizer needs, and pests and 
diseases.
Getting Down to Grassroots
If you dig out a wedge of turf and soil and look at it, you’ll see several layers. 
At the top is the mostly flat grass blade, which should be bright green. That’s 
the part of the plant that you mow every week. At the next-lower level, you 
see rounder grass stems and then the crown, where the roots meet the stems. 
The new grass growth emerges at the ground-hugging plant crown. Under the 
soil, you’ll find miles of roots for each grass plant. The root length is directly 
proportional to the plant health: The longer the roots, the healthier the plant. 
Grass plants come in two basic forms: clump-forming and creeping.

314
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Creeping: With creeping or sod-forming grasses, such as Kentucky
bluegrass or Bermuda grass, horizontal stems called stolons and 
rhizomes grow out of the crown, take root, and form new plants. Stolons 
grow on top of the soil; rhizomes grow underground, as shown in 
Figure 20-1.
 
✓ Clump-forming: Clump-forming or noncreeping grasses, such as 
chewings fescue and hard fescue, don’t spread by stolons or rhizomes. 
If allowed to grow without mowing, these and other grasses send up a 
tall flowering stalk that may produce seed.

grass types

Choosing the Right Grass
Organic lawn care gets a lot easier if you grow the right grass for your cli-
mate, sun, and soil conditions. You can find grasses that thrive under nearly 
every combination of lawn conditions. Finding the right grass variety for your 
lawn is easier than ever because plant breeders have worked hard to pro-
duce grasses that thrive under different conditions. 
 
One particular variety can’t do it all. For that reason, most grass seed and turf 
is sold as combinations of grasses that complement one another. The labels 
on grass seed packages list the percentage of each seed by weight, as well as 
other information such as what percentage of weed seed and inert matter the 
package contains and when the seed was tested for germination. The most 
important things to look for are improved varieties, current-year test date, and 
weed content of less than 1 percent.

315
 Chapter 20: Caring for Your Organic Lawn
Cool-season and warm-season grasses
Turfgrass species (grasses that are used for lawns) are classified as either 
cool season or warm season. The cool-season grasses grow best north of the 
so-called bluegrass line — an imaginary border that stretches from the middle 
of North Carolina through the centers of Arkansas and New Mexico into 
Southern California. The warm-season grasses grow best south of that line.
Too cool, man
Cool-season grasses prefer moist, cold-winter climates with mild summers. 
These grasses grow most actively in the cool spring and fall months; they 
may turn brown and become dormant during extended hot, dry periods in 
summer. Although traditionally grown north of the bluegrass line, cool-season 
grasses also grow well at higher elevations and in other, cooler microclimates 
south of the bluegrass line. (Jump to Chapter 3 for information about 
microclimates.) Trying to grow cool-season grasses outside their preferred 
climate, however, adds up to more maintenance and trouble. These species 
need frequent watering in arid climates and are prone to disease and insect 
attack in hot-summer spots. The main grass species that grow in the north 
include the following:
 
✓ Kentucky bluegrass is known for its cold-hardiness, fine-textured 
blades, and rich green color.
 
✓ Perennial ryegrass is tough enough to be used on athletic fields.
 
✓ Tall fescue is a good low-maintenance grass that can be allowed to 
grow tall.
 
✓ Chewings fescue grows well in light shade and tolerates cold and 
drought.
 
✓ Hard fescue is a low-maintenance species good for the far North.
 
✓ Red fescue (also known as creeping fescue) withstands shade and 
drought well.
 
✓ Bent grass is the very fine-textured (and very fussy) grass used mainly 
on golf putting greens.
Some like it hot
Warm-season grasses thrive where winters are mild and summer temperatures 
stay above 85 degrees Fahrenheit for months on end. Most don’t appreciate 
freezing weather and respond by turning brown. They grow vigorously, 
especially during the summer. Warm-season grass species for the South 
include the following:

316
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Bahia grass makes a thick, drought-tolerant lawn in the Gulf Coast 
states.
 
✓ Bermuda grass is the workhorse grass of the South. It grows fast and 
can withstand hot, dry weather.
 
✓ Centipede grass is called lazy man’s grass because it needs less mowing 
and water than other grasses do.
 
✓ Carpet grass has thick, coarse blades, but it grows well in the coastal 
plain region.
 
✓ St. Augustine grass may be the most attractive of all warm-season 
grasses, but it does require frequent watering and feeding to stay 
that way.
 
✓ Zoysia grass withstands more shade than most warm-season southern 
grasses but is slow to establish.
Regional preferences
Because climates vary in many ways other than temperature, it helps to 
divide the United States into nine turf-growing zones, as shown in Figure 20-2. 
Each zone has specific grass species best suited to grow in its climate.
 
✓ Zone 1 (the coastal West) is characterized by dry summers and cool, 
wet winters. Grow cool-season grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass, tall 
fescue, fine fescue, and perennial ryegrass.
 
✓ Zone 2 (the western transitional zone) has long dry summers and 
moderate winters. You can grow either warm- or cool-season grasses 
here. Hybrid Bermuda grass is popular for the summer. For winter color, 
sow seeds of a cool-season grass, such as ryegrass or tall fescue, over 
your warm-season grass lawn when it starts to turn brown or yellow in 
the fall.
 
✓ Zone 3 (the arid Southwest) has long, hot, dry summers and dry 
winters. Plant Bermuda grass or zoysia grass for summer in low-
elevation areas and overseed with ryegrass or fescue for winter color. 
In high elevations, plant drought-resistant buffalo grass.
 
✓ Zone 4 (the Great Plains) has two native turfgrasses: buffalo grass and 
blue grama grass. Plant them for a low-maintenance lawn. Use Bermuda 
grass or zoysia grass in the southern region, and use northern grasses, 
such as Kentucky bluegrass or perennial ryegrass, in the northern 
region.

317
 Chapter 20: Caring for Your Organic Lawn
 
✓ Zone 5 (the Midwest) offers moist, humid summers and cold winters. 
Any cool-season grasses will grow here, such as Kentucky bluegrass, 
perennial ryegrass, and any of the fescues. Warm-season zoysia grass 
may be grown in the southernmost areas.
 
✓ Zone 6 (the Northeast) has a climate similar to the Midwest, except with 
cooler summers and longer winters. Grow the same types of grasses — 
all cool-season species, especially Kentucky bluegrass and perennial 
ryegrass.
 
✓ Zone 7 (the eastern transitional zone) is an area where both warm-
season grasses such as Bermuda grass and cool-season grasses such as 
Kentucky bluegrass grow.
 
✓ Zone 8 (the central Southeast) has a warm, humid, and wet climate 
year-round. Although the cool-season grass tall fescue may be grown in 
high-elevation areas, this is primarily warm-season country, best suited 
for Bermuda grass, zoysia grass, and centipede grass.
 
✓ Zone 9 (the Gulf Coast) is even warmer and wetter than the central 
Southeast. Along with Bermuda grass and zoysia grass, you can grow 
centipede grass, Bahia grass, and St. Augustine grass here.

Best grass for trouble spots
Anybody can grow a lawn when conditions are perfect. But when they’re not 
so great, you can stack the odds in your favor by choosing grasses that have 
been proven to succeed under less-than-optimal conditions. Table 20-1 lists 
some of these varieties.

Researchers recently discovered that some grass species show increased 
resistance to insect and disease attack, and also need less water and fertilizer,
when the grass plants are colonized by beneficial fungi called endophytes. 
So-called endophyte-enhanced lawn seed mixes are now available for home 
lawns. You can’t see the fungi on the lawn; they’re inside the grass plant. Also 
look for grass mixes described as dwarf or semidwarf. These grasses grow 
more slowly than regular grasses, so they need less water, less fertilizer, and 
less-frequent mowing.
 
Endophyte-enhanced seed is only for lawns; it’s toxic to livestock and horses, 
and should not be used in pastures.
Preparing the Soil
When you’re planting a new lawn, you have only one chance to get it right. 
After you plant the grass, you can’t easily improve the soil or add amend-
ments, as you can with your vegetable gardens. Here are things you need to 
do to prepare your soil:

319
 Chapter 20: Caring for Your Organic Lawn
 
✓ Test for pH. The soil should be neutral to slightly acidic; pH 6 to 7 is 
best. Add enough lime or sulfur to bring the pH to the proper level.
 
✓ Add organic matter. Spread a 1-inch layer of compost, and till it in to a 
depth of 6 inches.
 
✓ Correct any potential drainage problems. Install drain tiles if 
necessary. Wet spots attract disease.
 
✓ Remove every single weed root. Allow the prepared soil to rest for a 
week or two, to allow weeds and weed seeds to sprout; then use a hoe to 
slice them off just under the soil.
 
✓ Rake the soil smooth and level. Hollows, ruts, and dips cause uneven 
turf growth, and result in wet or dry patches that encourage disease and 
attract insect pests.
For more about improving your soil, changing pH, and adding organic matter 
and other amendments, flip to Chapter 5.
Planting the Lawn
Whether you’re planting seed or laying sod, do it during the prime grass-
growing time for your area if at all possible. In the northern United States, 
late summer or early spring is best. In the South, the best time is late spring 
or late summer. As a rule, it’s okay to plant any time when you can count on 
about a month of temperate and moist weather to follow. That should give 
your grass enough time to get off to a good start.
 
If you need a lawn in a hurry, but it’s the wrong time to plant, sow a temporary
crop of annual ryegrass. The turf comes up fast. While it won’t survive a 
freezing winter, it can help prevent erosion and discourage weed seeds from 
sprouting until you can replace it with a permanent lawn.
Going for sod
Most people assume that starting a lawn from sod is easier, faster, and more 
reliable than seeding. Well, at least one of those assumptions is true: It’s 
faster. With sod, you can have a great-looking lawn in one day. But sodding 
(installing sod) requires just as much soil preparation work as seeding and 
even more aftercare. On the other hand, if you plant sod properly and nurse 
it through its establishment period, your lawn will start out entirely free of 
undesirable weedy plants, such as dandelions and thistle.

320
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
Installing sod
When it comes to installing sod, follow these two important rules for best 
results: Get the soil thoroughly moist and work quickly. It’s also a good idea 
to get the ground as level as possible and make sure that the soil is good to 
go before the sod arrives. You don’t want to let it sit and dry out in a heap.
 
If for some reason you can’t install the sod immediately, store it in a cool area 
out of the sun and cover it lightly with a tarp to keep it moist until you can 
install it. Mist it with water, if necessary, but don’t soak it. Wet sod is heavy to 
work with and may fall apart. 
To lay the sod, start at a straight edge, such as a driveway or sidewalk. 
Lay the sod pieces end to end, making sure that they butt up against each 
other tightly, with no bare soil showing. When you finish one row, offset the 
beginning of the next row so that the starting ends of each row are staggered 
instead of in a line.
Caring for your sod
Even after the entire area has been covered, your job is far from over. 
Aftercare is critical for success. Follow these steps:
 
1. Roll the entire area with a lawn roller to make sure that the sod is in 
good contact with the soil beneath it.
 
 You can rent a roller from any tool-rental agency.
 
2. Spread a small amount of topsoil over the sod, and work it into the 
cracks between strips with a broom.
 
3. Water — and keep watering!
 
 The sod needs pampering until the roots dig deep into the soil to forage 
for their own water. Don’t let the sod dry out for four weeks.
 
4. Mow the grass when it starts growing vigorously.
Creating a lawn from seed
If you start your lawn with seed, weeds can and will sprout along with the 
grass. That’s the major disadvantage of seed versus sod. But you have many 
more improved varieties of seed to choose among. Choosing seed also allows 
you to add the seeds of other desirable lawn plants, such as clover and white 
yarrow. Seed is much less expensive than sod, too.
How much seed do you need? That depends on the type of grass you’re 
planting. Use the number on the box to figure how much you need, and buy 
about one-quarter more than you think you need.

321
 Chapter 20: Caring for Your Organic Lawn
Prepare the soil as described in “Preparing the Soil,” earlier in this chapter, 
and then go over it one more time with a rake to remove all rocks and make 
the surface as level as possible. Water the area thoroughly.
You can sow the seed with a broadcast or drop spreader. A broadcast 
spreader spins the seeds out in a wide pattern. A drop spreader places the 
seeds in a band between the wheels. If the lawn area is small, you can also 
sow the seed by hand. No matter how you do it, be careful to get uniform 
coverage. Here’s how:
 
1. Divide the seed into two equal lots.
 
 If you need to spread 20 pounds of seed, for example, divide the seed 
into two 10-pound applications.
 
2. Adjust your spreader to deliver seed at half the rate recommended on 
the seed package.
 
3. Sow the first half of the seed across the lawn in rows.
 
4. Sow the second half of the seed in rows at right angles to the first until 
the whole lawn has been covered.
 
5. Rake very lightly to mix seeds into the top 
1⁄8 to 
1⁄4 inch of soil.
 
6. Roll with a water-filled lawn roller.
 
To speed germination, mulch the area with organic materials, such as finely 
shredded compost or dried manure, topsoil, finely chopped straw, or even a 
thin layer of sawdust. Apply it no more than 
1⁄4 inch thick and as evenly as pos-
sible. Avoid hay, which contains weed seeds.
 
Letting the tender grass seedlings dry out will kill them. For complete germina-
tion, you must keep the top layer of soil constantly moist. Soak the soil to a 
6-inch depth after sowing; then lightly sprinkle by hand or with a sprinkler as 
often as three to four times daily until the young grass is established.
Allow the young grass to reach its maximum recommended height before 
mowing. Read “There’s more to mowing,” later in this chapter, to find the 
best mowing height for your lawn grass.
Maintaining an Organic Lawn
Maintaining turf without chemicals requires that you understand a little 
bit about the habits of grass and the problems that plague it. Fortunately, 
proper mowing, watering, fertilizing, and aerating can go a long way toward 
preventing pest problems, especially diseases.

322
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
There’s more to mowing
The lawn mower is your most important turf-maintenance tool. Mowing not 
only cuts the grass down to size, but done properly, it also helps grass grow 
thicker. It can reduce the weed population, too, and even feed the turf.
Every type of grass has its own preferred height. Table 20-2 lists how high to 
set your mower blades. For best results, mow when the grass is no more 
than 50 percent taller than its optimal height (see Figure 20-3). If your grass 
should grow to 3 inches, for example, mow it when it reaches 4
1⁄2 inches tall. 
In general, mow at the bottom end of the range when the grass is actively 
growing and at the top end of the range during times of stress or slow 
growth.

Here’s how to get the best cut from your mower:
 
✓ Make sure the blade is sharp (sharpen it at least twice per season).
 
✓ Vary the mowing direction once a month to avoid soil compaction.
 
✓ Don’t mow when the grass is wet.
 
✓ Overlap by about one-third of the width of the mower deck with 
each pass.
 
✓ Clean the grass off the mower after each mowing.
 
One of the best things to happen to the organic lawn is the mulching mower, 
which pulverizes grass clippings into smaller pieces than a conventional 
mower does. Grass clippings are probably the best fertilizer your lawn can get 
because they provide free and natural nitrogen. When chopped into little bits, 
the clippings begin to break down into useful nitrogen almost as soon as they 
hit the ground.

Watering
People spend a lot of time, effort, and money keeping their lawns watered. 
In many parts of the country, that effort is wasted, because the lawn can 
survive the summer without any supplemental water. To withstand periods 
of drought, many types of turfgrass enter dormancy. They stop growing 
and turn brown. But when the rains return, the grass springs back to life. 
Sometimes, raising an organic lawn means putting up with an unattractive 
lawn for a while instead of using precious water resources. If and when you 
do irrigate your lawn, you must water deeply and slowly. Follow these tips:
 
✓ Water long enough to moisten the soil to a depth of 6 to 12 inches. 
The amount of time it takes to achieve this goal depends not only on the 
sprinkler, but also on the type of soil under the lawn.
 
 Standing out on the front lawn in the evening with a hose in hand does 
more harm than good. You’d have to stand out there for hours and 
hours to apply an adequate amount of water. Plus shallow sprinkling 
makes the roots lazy; if they get a little bit of water regularly, they 
become conditioned to staying near the surface of the soil. If you stop 
watering, your lawn will die of drought because the roots haven’t grown 
deep enough to forage for their own water.
 
✓ Apply water slowly enough so that it doesn’t puddle or run off your 
lawn. Look for a sprinkler with a low flow rate of less than 
1⁄4 inch of 
water per hour, especially if you have clay soil. On such heavy soil, you 
may need to cycle your watering by turning the water on for 15 minutes, 
off for 15 minutes, on again, and so on.

324
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
In general, high-quality oscillating and impulse sprinklers offer the most 
uniform coverage and cover the most ground.
 
The best time of day to water your lawn is early morning, which features 
cooler temperatures. You’ll lose less water to evaporation than at midday, and 
the grass blades will dry quickly, minimizing disease problems.
Feeding the lawn
Grass needs more nitrogen than any other nutrient for strong growth, and 
because it grows almost continuously, it needs a constant supply. Grass 
clippings themselves provide some natural fertilizer, but you can use several 
other organic materials to feed your lawn as well.
 
Natural fertilizers contain nitrogen that doesn’t dissolve readily in water but 
needs a little help from soil microorganisms to become available for plants. 
That’s good. It means that the nitrogen is released slowly, and consequently, 
the lawn grows slowly and steadily. Synthetic chemical lawn fertilizers, on the 
other hand, tend to release lots of nitrogen all at once, which makes the lawn 
grow fast at first, adding to your mowing chores. Also, chemical lawn fertilizers 
are among the largest sources of water pollution in the country.
Figuring out how much fertilizer you need
Your lawn probably needs less nitrogen than you think. You can figure out 
how much nitrogen to apply by using the following steps:
 
1. Find the amount of actual nitrogen required by the type of grass in 
your lawn.
 
 Cool-season fescues need 1 to 3 pounds of nitrogen per year per 1,000 
square feet. Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass need 2 to 3 
pounds, and bent grasses prefer 2 to 6 pounds. Warm-season blue grama 
and buffalo grasses need only 
1⁄2 to 1 pound of nitrogen; Bermuda and 
carpet grasses need 1 to 3 pounds; Bahia, centipede, and zoysia grasses 
need 2 to 3 pounds; and St. Augustine grass needs 3 to 6 pounds.
 
 If you don’t know the predominant type of grass in your lawn, dig up a 
sample and take it to your local extension office or a full-service nursery 
for identification. Or start with 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1,000 
square feet twice a year; that’s a safe maintenance dose.
 
2. Find the percentage of actual nitrogen in the fertilizer you want to use.
 
 See Chapter 6 for naturally nitrogen-rich fertilizers and the percentage of 
nitrogen they contain.
 
3. Plug those numbers into the following formula to determine exactly 
how much material you need to feed your lawn:

325
 Chapter 20: Caring for Your Organic Lawn
 
 Pounds of nitrogen that grass requires per year ÷ percentage of nitrogen 
in the fertilizer = pounds of fertilizer required per year per 1,000 square 
feet.
 
 Kentucky bluegrass, for example, requires 2 pounds of actual nitrogen 
per year, per 1,000 square feet. A bag of 10-6-4 organic lawn fertilizer 
contains 10 percent actual nitrogen, and 2 divided by .10 (10 percent 
converted to decimal) equals 20. So 1,000 square feet of Kentucky 
bluegrass would require 20 pounds of 10-6-4 fertilizer per year.
 
4. Divide the pounds of fertilizer required per year by the number of 
applications you plan to make.
 
 If you plan to fertilize your lawn twice, for example, divide the answer 
you get in Step 3 by 2 to find the amount you need for each application.
 
Just by leaving the grass clippings on the lawn to decompose, you’re adding 
the equivalent of about 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet. Consider 
this fact in your fertilizer calculations.
 
Many homeowners think of their property in terms of acres rather than square 
feet. A 
1⁄4-acre lot is roughly 10,000 square feet. Subtract the square footage of 
nonlawn areas to get the approximate size of your lawn.
Knowing when to feed
Most folks go into a lawn-feeding frenzy at the first sign of spring, but for 
most of the country, that’s not the best time to feed the grass. It’s better to 
fertilize in autumn in cold climates. That practice helps the grass grow strong 
and packs away some nutrients for the following year. In warmer climates, 
the best time to feed is late spring, after the grass breaks out of dormancy 
and begins to grow again. Warm-season grasses need regular feeding to 
survive the stressful summer months. Cold-season grasses usually can get by 
with just one or two feedings per year.
 
If you want to green up your lawn quickly and naturally, use a hose-end 
sprayer to apply liquid seaweed. The iron in the seaweed encourages a rich 
green color.
Thinking about thatch
As grass plant parts die, they can form a tangled mat of undecomposed or 
partially decomposed organic matter on the surface of the soil called thatch. 
A little thatch is a good thing. If it’s less than 
1⁄4 to 
1⁄2 inch thick, thatch helps 
cool and cushion the soil, as well as conserve moisture. Thick thatch may 
cause problems, however. A layer more than 
1⁄2 inch thick keeps water and 
nutrients from reaching the soil and provides a cozy home for turf-destroying 
insects and diseases.

326
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
If thatch builds up on your lawn, remove it, or dethatch the lawn. For small 
areas, you can use a thatch rake (sometimes called a cavex rake) to scratch 
the thatch from the soil. This job is backbreaking work, however, so try it 
only on small lawns. For large areas, rent a dethatcher (also called a vertical 
mower). This gasoline-powered device cuts the thatch and lifts it to the 
surface, where you can easily rake it up.
Loosening the soil
The soil under a lawn takes a lot of abuse. You walk and run over it, stand 
on it, run a heavy mower over it regularly, and sometimes even drive over it. 
The result is compaction that slows the growth of the grass. With you can’t 
turn and condition the soil every year for a lawn, there is a specialized way to 
cure lawn compaction and invigorate the soil: aeration.
Aeration is simply the process of creating holes in the turf. Done right, it 
removes cores of compacted soil, leaving room for air, water, and nutrients 
to penetrate. On small lawns, you can aerate by hand. For less than $20, you 
can buy a hand aerator that uses foot power to remove cores of soil. For 
large lawns, you can rent a power aerator from the local tool-rental shop. 
Steer it over the lawn like a lawn mower as it jams its tines into the turf, 
removing cores of soil in the process.
With either implement, the next step is to break up the cores and leave them 
on the surface of the lawn to decompose — or, if you find the waste too 
unsightly, rake it up and toss it into the compost heap. If you use your lawn 
heavily, aerate once a year, just like they do down at the ball field.
Top-dressing
Most lawn owners neglect one very important organic lawn-care practice: 
top-dressing, which is simply spreading a thin layer of organic matter over 
the lawn. No, it’s not fertilizing per se, but it does improve the soil and can 
provide nutrients depending on the material used. Top-dressing is vital 
because you don’t dig up the lawn every year; the only way to improve the 
soil is from the top down.
Top-dressing is a simple process. In autumn, spread a very thin (about 
1⁄4 inch 
deep) layer of organic matter over the lawn. Use topsoil, shredded compost, 
or any other organic matter. The material works its way down through the 
sod, with the help of earthworms and other critters, to improve the texture 
of the soil. You can make the process even more effective by aerating the turf 
first (refer to “Loosening the soil,” earlier in this chapter).

Weeding
The best way to defeat weeds is to grow a healthy, thick sod. Fertilizing, 
watering, and mowing properly all make the grass thicker, which makes it 
tougher for weeds to get a foothold. In fact, correct mowing alone can help 
control certain types of weeds. University experiments show that mowing a 
bluegrass lawn at a height of 2 inches helps reduce the amount of crabgrass 
in a lawn significantly. Mowing your lawn higher helps the grass outcompete 
low-growing weeds, such as crabgrass and creeping Charlie.
You can also use old-fashioned elbow grease. When you find weeds in your 
lawn, pull ’em or chop them out. Long-handled specialty weeding tools for 
the lawn, such as the Houn Dog Weeder and the Speedy Weeder, make a 
surprisingly fast and easy job of pulling dandelions, plantain, and other lawn 
weeds.
Recently, some natural herbicides have become available that give organic-
lawn owners a lucky break. Corn gluten meal is a highly effective natural turf 
herbicide. It works as a pre-emergent to kill sprouting plantain, creeping bent 
grass, dandelion, and many other weed seeds. Apply 25 pounds per 1,250 
square feet in spring before weeds begin to sprout. Don’t apply it to newly 
seeded lawns, however. Corn gluten meal also contains about 10 percent 
nitrogen, so it serves double duty on the lawn. For already growing weeds, 
you can also try Sharpshooter, a broad-spectrum, soap-based organic herbicide 
that kills all vegetation on contact. Use it with caution, because it kills grass 
as well as weeds. For more on weeds and weeding, turn to Chapter 11.
 
Perhaps the best way to deal with weeds is to change your definition of them. 
Take clover, for example. Just because clover isn’t a grass plant doesn’t mean 
that it doesn’t belong in the lawn. Clover stays green through tough weather, 
recovers nicely from mowing, and is soft and cushiony. Also, unlike grass, it 
increases the fertility of the soil by taking nitrogen from the air and making it 
available to plant roots in the soil. Other so-called weeds, such as yarrow and 
Roman chamomile, attract beneficial insects. 
Managing pests
Although a long list of insects may chow down on grass, only a few pests 
really do serious damage to turfgrass, and organic treatments exist for all 
of them. The most notorious and damaging turf pest is the grub, which is 
an immature beetle that lives in the soil. Grubs, especially the larvae of 
Japanese beetles, can do a number on turf. They feast on grass roots and kill 
the plants in the process. Pull up a patch of sod, and if you see a dozen grubs 
per square foot, it’s time to take action. Here are two biological controls for 
grubs:

328
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
✓ Milky spore disease: This bacteria species infects and kills grubs. Apply 
at a rate of 4 ounces per 1,000 square feet any time the grubs are active. 
It works best in areas where the soil temperature remains above 70 
degrees Fahrenheit for several months a year.
 
✓ Beneficial nematodes: Spray these microscopic worms onto the soil, 
and they begin killing grubs within 48 hours and continue their grub-
killing duty for months. In the process, they also eliminate cutworms 
and armyworms. Flip to Chapter 8 for more on milky spore disease, 
beneficial nematodes, and other safe pest controls.
 
Intensive turfgrass breeding has yielded several new varieties of grass that 
actually resist damage from greenbugs, armyworms, billbugs, cutworms, 
and sob webworms. Look for the tall-fescue variety Apache and several 
perennial varieties, including Premier, All Star, Cowboy, Prelude, Sunrise, 
Pennant, Citation II, and Repell. Also look for endophyte-enhanced lawn seed 
mixes that minimize insect damage (refer to “Best grass for trouble spots,” 
earlier in this chapter).
Switching to Lawn Alternatives
Lawns just don’t belong in some places, and trying to grow grass where 
it won’t thrive is just going to cause heartache. Grass doesn’t like shade. 
It doesn’t like wet roots. Sometimes it can’t stand too much foot traffic. It 
doesn’t like hard and dry soil. In situations like these, you may do better to 
find a substitute for turfgrass that enjoys the conditions you have.
Using low-maintenance grass
 
If you really want a lawn, but your conditions just don’t suit most turfgrasses, 
consider a tough-as-nails native grass instead. Two native grasses — buffalo 
grass and blue grama grass — work well in hot, dry conditions with little 
maintenance. You can mow and maintain them as a lawn or let them grow as 
meadow grasses.
 
✓ Buffalo grass is a Plains native and as such has adapted to survive with 
very little water. It makes an attractive fine-textured lawn when watered 
and mowed; it’s also an ornamental prairie grass when it’s allowed to go 
dormant during periods of low rainfall. For the best-looking lawn, mow it 
high — 2 to 3 inches high — to discourage weeds. Despite its tolerance 
to heat, sun, and hard dry soil, buffalo grass doesn’t like shade or sandy, 
wet soils.

329
 Chapter 20: Caring for Your Organic Lawn
 
✓ Blue grama grass is another North American native. This bunch-type 
grass forms a dense sod of fine-bladed grass. During drought, it goes 
dormant and turns brown. It requires little fertilizer, no watering, and 
only infrequent mowing while surviving extreme heat and cold.
Growing ground covers
When you’re trying to fill a shady spot where grass won’t grow or reducing 
the size of your lawn, you’re likely to look for ground covers. By their very 
nature, ground covers are low-growing plants that spread rapidly to colonize 
large expanses. Good ground-cover options include partridgeberry (Mitchella 
repens), wild ginger (Asarum canadense), Allegheny spurge (Pachysandra 
procumbens), and creeping phlox (Phlox stolonifera). Many taller perennials 
would make fine shade garden plants; see Chapter 17 for ideas.
 
Some of the fastest-growing ground covers can quickly become troublesome, 
invasive plants. Ajuga, lily of the valley, pachysandra, periwinkle, and (to a 
lesser extent) liriope are common, readily available, shade-tolerant ground 
covers that are also notoriously invasive.
Sun-loving, noninvasive ground covers include Phlox subulata, three-toothed 
cinquefoil (Sibbaldiopsis tridentata, formerly Potentilla tridentata), and golden-
star or green-and-gold (Chrysogonum virginianum).
Making a meadow
Meadows and prairies sound too good to be true, and in a way, they are. 
Despite the common belief that making a meadow involves little more than 
sowing some seeds and allowing nature to take its course, meadows require 
more work than that. It’s true that after it’s established, a meadow or prairie 
takes less time and labor than a lawn or a flower bed. But getting a meadow 
started takes just as much preparation and labor as establishing a lawn.
You can plant a meadow or prairie in either of two simple ways. If you start 
with bare ground, follow this procedure:
 
1. Prepare the area as you would for a lawn.
 
 Rotary-till the top few inches of soil and rake it smooth, removing as 
many weed roots, stolons, and tubers as possible.
 
2. Sow a low-maintenance, clump-forming grass, such as sheep fescue, in 
cold climates or buffalo grass in warmer areas.

330
Part IV: Growing Organically in Your Yard and Garden 
 
 Avoid grasses that spread by runners or stolons. Sow it at one-half the 
recommended rate.
 
3. Plant transplants or sow wildflower seed at random spots, about 2 or 
3 feet apart, throughout the area.
 
 Keep those spots grass free until the wildflower plants are established.
 
A less labor-intensive way to establish a meadow is to plant in existing turf. 
Remove patches of turf throughout the lawn, and replace it with wildflower 
plants or seeds. Gradually remove more and more of the lawn each year.

regions of the United States.

f you like lists as much as I do, welcome to Part V. It’s 
also a good place to get started if you want to be an 
organic gardener but really don’t know what to do first. 
This part sums up the major principles and techniques of 
organic gardening in a few short pages and offers ideas for 
making your home and landscape more eco-friendly.

Chapter 21
Ten Best Organic Gardening 
Practices
In This Chapter
▶ Combining the best strategies
▶ Beating the pests naturally
▶ Promoting plant health
T
he most successful organic gardeners use a combination of strategies 
to grow healthy food and ornamental plants. They monitor and increase 
soil fertility, observe and emulate nature, and make planting decisions based 
on the needs of the plants and opportunities of the site. Organic gardeners 
see their gardens as small parts of the larger natural world and understand 
that their gardening practices have an impact that goes far beyond the borders 
of their yards. If you’re just getting started, though, all these practices can 
seem daunting — even discouraging. Keep in mind that gardening is a process, 
and take it one step at a time. Add the ten practices in this chapter one at a 
time, and you’ll be gardening organically before you know it.
Enrich Your Soil
Plant health starts with the soil, so it makes sense to put this organic 
gardening practice at the top of the list. Get your soil right, and many other 
potential problems are apt to be less troublesome.
Soil is composed of various sizes and shapes of mineral particles, which give 
it texture. You can’t do much to alter your soil’s texture except bring in loads 
of sand or topsoil, but you can change the other soil components: organic 
matter, air, water, and soil organisms. Organic matter, which decomposes 
into humus, increases soil’s ability to hold moisture and drain efficiently, 
feeds the beneficial soil organisms, and adds important plant nutrients. You 
can increase the amount of organic matter in your soil by adding compost 

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
and using plant-based mulches, such as shredded leaves, bark, and straw. 
Make your own compost, as described in Chapter 5, or buy it in bags or bulk 
from a local nursery.
 
You can improve the ratio of air and water in your soil, too, by avoiding 
excessive tilling, compacting the soil as little as possible, and adding organic 
matter.
Mulch Early, Mulch Often
Weeds flourish on open ground, but mulch can slow them — or even stop 
them in their tracks. Surround your garden and landscape plants with bark, 
pine needles, grass clippings, shredded leaves, straw, and other organic 
materials to shade the ground and keep weeds from sprouting. Use landscape 
fabric or newspaper in paths and around trees and shrubs, covering them 
with loose mulch materials.
Grow living mulches, too: Sow cover crops in empty vegetable garden beds 
and over the whole garden at the end of the growing season to crowd out 
weeds. Find out more about mulches and cover crops in Chapter 11.
Choose Healthy and Disease-Resistant 
Plants
Your plants won’t get sick if they’re immune to or at least tolerant of the 
nastiest diseases. Plant breeders work long and hard to develop varieties
of your favorite fruits, vegetables, flowers, and landscape plants that fight 
off devastating diseases. Read catalog descriptions and plant tags to find 
resistant plants whenever possible. It also pays to buy and plant only 
healthy plants. Take time to find the healthiest specimens, as I describe in 
Chapter 12. Don’t bring home any insect-infested plants, either. If you have 
any doubts about a plant’s health, quarantine a new plant in a separate area 
before adding it to your landscape or garden.
Put Plants in the Right Place
Struggling plants attract diseases and insects, but thriving plants fight them 
off. Give your plants the soil, sun, and moisture conditions they prefer to 
keep them healthy and thriving. Consider native plants that naturally grow 
in your region or in a similar climate. If you have an established garden, 

335
 Chapter 21: Ten Best Organic Gardening Practices
replace the unhappy campers with plants that have a can-do attitude. Use 
the observation and planning steps in Chapter 3 to inventory what your yard 
has to offer; then find plants with needs that match.
Use Organic, Slow-Release Fertilizers
Many synthetic fertilizers contain highly soluble nutrients that force plants 
into quick, lush growth. Although this growth may seem like a good thing, it’s 
not; succulent growth is very attractive to insect and disease pests. Also, any 
fertilizer that isn’t taken up immediately by plants may run off and pollute 
waterways. Most organic fertilizers are the slow-release kind. The nutrients 
are bound up in large molecules and are released slowly through the action 
of microorganisms. Plants receive a slow, steady diet of nutrients, and the 
risk of runoff is minimized. See Chapter 6 for full details on fertilizers.
Encourage Beneficial Organisms
Each harmful insect has a predator or parasite that attacks it, making your 
work easier. You can cheer these helpmates by planting flowers and other 
plants that they’re attracted to and by avoiding the use of pesticides. Other 
garden visitors — including birds, bats, and toads — can also help you in 
your pest control efforts, so welcome them into your landscape.
Many crops require pollination by visiting insects, and unfortunately, the 
populations of many native pollinating insects are in decline. Invite these 
important garden denizens by providing food and shelter, in addition to 
avoiding pesticides. Chapter 7 gives you more information on beneficial 
creatures versus pests.
Practice Integrated Pest Management
Integrated pest management (IPM for short) is the practice of looking at all the 
costs and options before deciding on a course of pest treatment. Instead of 
merely eradicating pests, you manage them. In practicing IPM, you do the 
following:
 
✓ Monitor the weather carefully. The appearance of many insects and 
diseases is tied closely to the temperature, humidity, and time of the year.
 
✓ Monitor pests. It doesn’t make sense to treat for pests unless they’re 
causing serious damage. A few pests may be insignificant and tolerable 
in the big picture.

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Keep everything clean. Practice good cultural techniques: Rotate crops 
from one part of the garden to another, destroy harmful weeds, and 
clean up infested plant debris.
 
✓ Use the least invasive and least toxic control methods first. Start with 
nontoxic controls, such as dislodging insects with a strong blast of water.
Control Pests with Traps and Barriers
Sometimes, protecting your crops from insects is as easy as throwing a fabric 
row cover over them. If the cabbage moths can’t reach your broccoli to lay 
their eggs, for example, you won’t find caterpillars in your vegetables. A strip 
of newspaper wrapped around the tender stem of a seedling can prevent a 
cutworm from chewing through it. You can foil many common pests with 
specially colored, sticky-coated traps. See Chapter 8 for more ideas.
 
You can also use insects’ own attractants against them. Pheromones, which 
are scents secreted by insects to attract a mate, are among the most powerful 
tools in your pest control kit. Pheromone baits combined with traps are the 
downfall of millions of Japanese beetles and other pests every year. These 
baits attract only the pests you want to eradicate, so they’re safe to use 
around beneficial insects.
Avoid the Most Toxic Pesticides
Commonly available synthetic pesticides are some of the most toxic materials
 used by homeowners. Fortunately, gardeners who choose or need to use 
some pesticides have organic alternatives to synthetic chemicals. Even 
organic pesticides, however, such as pyrethrum and neem, can harm 
beneficial organisms. Always follow the label directions precisely if you 
choose to use pesticides, and use them as a last resort. See Chapters 7 and 8 
for more information on managing pests without pesticide sprays.
Promote Diversity
Natural plant populations contain many species scattered over a large area, 
making them less vulnerable to insect and pest eradication. Use the same 
concepts in your garden by mixing crops within a row and avoiding large 
patches of the same variety. Instead of planting a long hedge made up of a 
dozen or more specimens of the same species of shrub, for example, 
consider designing a mixed border that includes a variety of evergreens and 
perhaps some flowering and fruiting small trees and shrubs.

eing eco-friendly means more than simply not spraying chemicals. 
You can minimize your ecological footprint, both in what you do and 
in what you don’t do. Here are some ways to conserve resources, reuse and 
recycle, and minimize the environmental effect of activities in your home and 
landscape.
Don’t Be a Perfectionist
Seeking perfection — unblemished red apples, long straight stems topped by 
curvaceous rosebuds, or a lawn with nary a dandelion in sight — is tempting. 
Usually, though, that perfection just isn’t worth the effort and the resources 
required. If you tend to be a perfectionist, consider a change of perspective. 
I find perfection in many things, such as a balanced ecosystem of plants, 
insects, and microorganisms that benefit one another. I find it in a lesson 
learned from experience. I find it in the satisfaction of knowing that I did 
my best.
 
If you must have perfection in your garden, choose one thing and nurture it 
well, but let the rest be what it will. My own obsession is a neatly tended patch 
of blueberry bushes. Visitors find weeds in my lawn and gardens, but not in 
the blueberries!

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle
Before you buy a product, consider its useful life and what will happen to it 
when you’re through with it. Is it something that will last a long time? Can 
you reuse or at least recycle it? Reducing the number of throwaway products 
is an important part of an eco-friendly lifestyle. Similarly, look for products 
with minimal or at least recyclable packaging.
Before you throw anything away, consider whether it could be of use to 
someone else. Used plastic pots, for example, may be trash to you, but 
organizers of a local school garden may welcome them.
Compost Kitchen Scraps and Yard Debris
Layer kitchen scraps with lawn clippings, chopped dry leaves, shredded 
twigs and plant stalks, and other landscape and garden debris to make rich 
compost. Composting recycles the nutrients contained in organic materials. 
My family keeps a small plastic bucket with a lid right in the kitchen sink, and 
that bucket is where all our eggshells, teabags, fruit and vegetable scraps, 
and inedible leftovers go. When it’s full, my uncomplaining spouse carries 
it out to spread in the compost bin. (I love that man.) Our composting habit 
keeps our trash can smelling better, makes the earthworms happy, and keeps 
our dog from getting fat. Flip to Chapter 5 for details on how to make your 
own compost pile.
Reduce (Or Eliminate) Your Lawn
Reducing or eliminating your lawn is a great way to cut your water bill, 
especially if you live where less than 30 inches of rain falls during the 
growing season. (Spread out evenly over the span of a growing season, 30 
inches of rain equals about 1 inch of water a week — the amount of water 
that lawns need to grow well.) Even if you live where water is plentiful, 
making your lawn smaller makes ecological sense.
In the many parts of the western United States, water is diverted from distant 
rivers and springs so that city residents can have plenty of water. Although 
much of the diverted water is necessary for city survival, using it on lawns 
is a questionable practice at best. Moving water from where it’s plentiful to 
where it isn’t takes energy. Many gardeners worry about the fumes that lawn 

339
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to be Eco-Friendly
mowers make, and that concern is a valid one. But power plants also spew 
out fumes as they create electricity for the water pumps that move the water 
through the pipes over the mountains and across the deserts to the lawn 
sprinklers.
If you must have a lawn, make it smaller. Think of it as an appetizer instead 
of the main course. Plant drought-tolerant grasses, and use the water-saving 
tips in Chapter 20.
Plant a Tree
The list of reasons why trees are good for the environment is long, and 
you’ve probably heard many of the them before: wildlife habitat, shade, 
erosion control, increased property value, wind protection, and carbon 
dioxide trapping, to name a few. Trees are also beautiful in their own right. 
To plant a tree is to plan for the future — your children’s future, your 
neighborhood’s future, your planet’s future. Check out Chapter 19 for 
information about good trees and how to plant them.
Choose Human-Powered Equipment
Whenever possible, choose tools powered by old-fashioned elbow grease. 
Think rakes and brooms instead of leaf blowers, for example. Although 
electric- and battery-powered equipment creates less on-site pollution than 
gasoline-powered tools, keep in mind that the electricity they use has to be 
generated somewhere, invariably causing some degree of pollution — just 
not in your backyard. If you have a small lawn, consider a new, high-quality 
version of the traditional reel mower. This type of mower is quiet and easy 
to push.
Minimize All Forms of Pollution
The fumes from your two-stroke, oil-burning, gas-powered string trimmer — 
and the loud noise it makes — are obvious sources of air and noise pollution. 
Keep your eyes out for more subtle types, too. Evaluate your landscape 
lighting, and eliminate unnecessary lights to decrease light pollution, for 
example. Consider quiet, solar-powered pumps for fountains.

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Teach Your Children Well
Helping children discover the pleasures of gardening and connecting with 
the natural world ensures that future generations will become eco-friendly, 
too. Start small by sprouting seeds together or talking about the plants you 
see on a walk. Name the vegetables and fruits in the supermarket, and talk 
about where and how they grow. For more great ideas about gardening with 
children at home and in schools, visit the National Gardening Association’s 
Kidsgardening Web site at www.kidsgardening.com.
Become a Locavore
Most of us can’t grow all our own food, but we can strive to eat locally 
produced foods harvested at their peak of flavor and nutrition. Support local 
farmers by buying direct from the farm and at local farmers’ markets. Or join 
a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) organization, which is essentially 
a subscription for locally produced foods. You pay a certain amount to the 
farmer up front, usually in early spring, and then receive weekly deliveries of 
produce, flowers, fruit, eggs, or other farm products.
Many small farms are organic; those that aren’t usually use ecologically 
sound practices. Ask the farmers, and they’ll be happy to tell you about their 
farming philosophy and techniques. For products that can’t be grown locally, 
such as coffee and chocolate, look for organic options. Also, some companies 
sell products described as “fair trade” or “sustainably grown” that benefit 
both the environment and family farmers in their native countries.
Consider the Seventh Generation
According to The Great Law of the Iroquois, “In every deliberation we must 
consider the impact on the seventh generation.” By looking at all your 
decisions through this lens, you’ll choose activities and products that have a 
minimum negative effect on the environment. After all, don’t you want your 
great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren to inherit a vibrant, ecologically 
diverse Earth that is able to sustain them and their progeny? Maintaining 
your gardens and landscape by using organic techniques is one step toward 
this goal.
