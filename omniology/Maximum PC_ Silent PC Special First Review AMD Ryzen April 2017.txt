There’s someThing exciTing coming 
this year that I’ve been eagerly awaiting: 
faster storage. Those who know me know 
I archive everything. I love all things 
storage, including its speed. Which is 
why Intel’s XPoint, which is now referred 
to as Optane, is so exciting. When Intel 
initially announced Optane, it said that 
the new storage technology would 
deliver performance greater than 1,000 
times that of today’s fastest NVMe SSDs. 
This isn’t just fast, it’s a humiliation of 
what we have today.
Based on a manufacturing process 
that employs phase-change memory 
designs, 
drives 
that 
utilize 
XPoint 
technology are poised to deliver a 
gargantuan increase in both storage 
capacity and performance. If that’s 
possible, it would be a real challenge to 
spinning-disk hard drives. Today, if you 
want large capacity, you still have to 
really on hard drives, which currently top 
out at 10 terabytes. XPoint would be the 
holy grail of storage for me, especially 
as I use an enormous number of hard 
drives. This is a problem. 
I have to deal with technology on a 
daily basis, and while it’s exciting, fun, 
and educational, there’s just one tidbit 
that I can’t seem to get a handle on: the 
noise. My home is full of hardware. The 
worse part of it is, my home office is also 
part of where I sleep. It’s one long room 
that’s divided in half: a bedroom on one 
side and an office on the other.
I think I’ve gotten to the point where 
I’ve become numb to all the whirring 
sounds of technology, but it’s still 
bothersome at times, especially when I 
need to test things such as headphones. 
Servers, PCs, and cooling equipment 
all generate noise. I’ve gotten around to 
replacing stock fans on products with 
quieter and lower-rpm fans, but they still 
generate a noise when everything’s on. 
For most people, their PC is the center of 
this problem.
Thankfully, we’ve put together an 
exhaustive guide for you on how to 
build a dream setup that’s both potent 
and whisper-quiet. This is typically 
a dichotomy, because power usually 
means noisy—just look at cars. And, 
yes, I know you can get a very quiet Tesla 
Model SP100D, and humiliate virtually 
every petro-powered supercar without 
making a peep. With a little planning 
and careful selection of components, 
however, you can achieve the equivalent 
of a Tesla in the form of a PC.
For my own main rig, I’ve taken a 
few tips right out of these pages: silent 
water cooling, high-quality fans, and an 
increased reliance on SSDs. I even went 
as far as to water-cool my graphics card. 
The possibilities are essentially endless, 
and I’m happy with the results I’ve 
achieved. The only issue is achieving the 
same levels of silence with the myriads 
of servers that dwell within my room. 
This is a challenge that I’ve yet to tackle.
There will be some point in the 
future where I imagine my room to be 
thoroughly water cooled, all storage 
equipment is solid state, and everything 
is silent. But that’s still a ways off. For 
now, I’ll settle for silencing my PC, and 
living with 48 spinning hard drives.

All we had hoped for is true: AMD has raised the 
bar for processors with its new architecture
Ryzen Rules
three initially. The A320 is a 
mainstream 
chipset, 
while 
the B350 is where things 
get interesting, as it offers 
overclocking and better USB 
support. However, the one 
all eyes will inevitably swivel 
toward is the X370, which 
has everything thrown at it, 
including SLI and CrossFire 
support, four DDR4-3200 slots, 
two 16-lane PCIe, and more. 
Later on, we will see A300, 
B300, and X300 chipsets all 
aimed at small form factor 
builds, with the latter offering 
overclocking goodness.
Some small wrinkles have 
emerged. Asus has discovered 
that there are issues with 
high-frequency DDR4 memory, 
making 
it 
unstable 
above 
2,400MHz if you use four sticks 
(although with two sticks, 
3,200MHz is fine). BIOS and 
memory controller fixes are 
due shortly. Also, despite initial 
hopes to the contrary, Ryzen is a 
Win 10-only affair. Face it, you’ll 
have to upgrade eventually. 
The 
more 
mainstream 
Ryzen 5 chips are expected 
in the spring, with the Ryzen 
3 family planned for later in 
the year. These will similarly 
undercut Intel Core i5 and 
i3 offerings in price and 
performance; Intel is facing 
pressure across the range. 
What can Intel do? In the 
short term, not a lot. There’s 
precious little room to crank 
up clock speeds on the current 
Core i7 chips. Most obviously, 
it can cut prices; at the time 
of going to press there have 
been no official price cuts 
yet, but we suspect you won’t 
have to wait long. Retailers 
are already discounting like 
crazy. At Microcenter, the Core 
i7-6950X has dropped $300, 
and the i7-6900K by $200. The 
price cuts run right through 
the Intel range. Intel’s people 
will be out there now trying to 
cut deals. The company has an 
unflattering history here, and 
has picked up fines for anti-
competitive practices in the 
past, under the guise of counter 
rebates and such. Let’s hope it 
can keep things clean this time.
For any real response, we 
have to wait until August, and 
the launch of Kaby Lake-X and 
Skylake-X. These are branded 
as Core i7-7000 series chips, 
and use a new 2,066-pin socket 
and X299 chipset. The range 
will include 10-core versions; 
rumor has it that Intel is 
developing a 12-core version, 
but this is highly speculative. 
What is clear is that Intel will 
have to do something. This 
is not a company that enjoys 
coming second. It will respond.
Meanwhile, AMD is enjoying 
a well-deserved moment in the 
sun. So far, Ryzen has lived up 
to our expectations—it’s hugely 
fast, and priced to sell. AMD has 
put itself right back in the game, 
and caused high-power CPUs to 
tumble in price. And for that, we 
can all be thankful. –CL
It’s here for reaL. AMD’s 
new processor architecture is 
available, and it’s just as fast 
and as competitive as we’d 
hoped. AMD has started at the 
top, by releasing three eight-
core chips: the $329 3.0/3.7GHz 
(base clock and boost) 1700, the 
$399 3.4/3.8GHz 1700X, and 
the $499 3.6/4.0GHz 1800X. 
The “X” stands for eXtreme. 
Performance is very strong, 
and at those prices, Intel’s Core 
i7s are starting to look woefully 
poor value.
Initial benchmarks put Ryzen 
on a par with or better than 
Intel’s finest (see our review 
of the 1800X on page 76). The 
overclockers have already been 
at play, and one bright spark 
has produced a world-record 
Cinebench R15 score of 2,449, 
achieved at 5.2GHz, with the 
help of some judicious cooling. 
Pre-orders have been huge; 
currently, 
the 
best-selling 
processor on Amazon is the 
Ryzen 7 1800X. This has been 
the most hotly anticipated 
launch since Intel unleashed 
the Core 2, in 2006.
Alongside the processors, 
we have motherboard chipsets 
for the new AM4 boards—
One bright spark produced a 
world-record Cinebench R15 
score of 2,449 at 5.2GHz. 
The official reveal: 
Not much to see, 
but this is the 
hottest processor 
launch for years.

If you are runnIng VIsta, you won’t need to 
be told that support from Microsoft is ending 
on April 11—you’ve had an annoying pop-up 
telling you that for weeks. All updates and 
security patches will stop, and you’ll be on 
your own. Vista was never very popular; it 
took some serious patching and Service 
Packs before it stabilized, installation 
was cumbersome, and driver support 
erratic. Sales were poor—according to 
NetMarketShare, it currently accounts 
for under 1 percent of the world’s PCs. 
Windows 7 is still the most popular, at over 
47 percent—those people have until 2020 
before support is pulled. The end of Vista 
isn’t going to be the shock that the death of 
Windows XP caused. This was so unpopular 
that Microsoft had to extend support and add 
XP Mode to Win 7. Vista has had a good 10-
year run, and won’t be missed.
Do you have to upgrade? Not really. The 
lack of security updates is an issue, but 
proper security practice can replace much 
of that. However, things will slowly become 
more awkward if you insist on installing new 
hardware and software. Game and driver 
support will vanish—Gmail and Blizzard 
have already announced their withdrawal 
of support.
Meanwhile, Windows 10 is due for two 
major updates this year. Along with the 
Creators Update this spring, we have 
“Redstone 3” being readied for the fall. It 
is expected to include Composite Shell, to 
unify the Windows interface across devices, 
Project NEON, to animate screen elements, 
and My People, carried over from the 
Creators Update, designed to make sharing 
with contacts a drag-and-drop operation. 
Windows 10 looks to be on about an eight-
month cycle of updates—fairly hectic by 
Windows standards. –CL 
DrIVerLess Cars are coming; Uber 
has started a trial of its new vehicles 
in Arizona. You might wonder how 
the company managed to create such 
complex technological hardware with no previous history, but Uber spent $680 
million buying Otto last year, which was developing the tech, including LiDAR, 
Light Detection And Ranging, the hardware that tracks the car’s position.
Otto was founded by ex-Google employees, half of whom were working in 
Google’s driverless car division. Google claims they stole data before they left. It 
says it has “significant” evidence, including download logs totaling 14,000 files 
of blueprints and technical data. Uber has issued a denial, but the situation could 
be very painful for the company, which has been very ambitious to get driverless 
cars to the streets before anyone else. This case could derail those plans, and 
prove expensive for a company that already posts alarming losses. –CL

Atom Goes  
16-core
InteL’s baby proCessor, the Atom, has had 
fresh life breathed into it with the release of the 
C3000, armed with 16 low-power x86 cores, and clock speeds up to 2.2GHz. It’s aimed at 
NAS and IoT devices, where data throughput is more important than processing power. 
The previous Atom C2000 has an unenviable reputation for frying itself after a year or two. 
Details as to why are scarce, but it was a headache for manufacturers. 
This also highlights the repositioning of the Atom. It was originally designed with phones 
and netbooks in mind, but poor performance and even poorer sales caused Intel to drop 
any attempt at the market last year. It canceled all development of new mobile versions, 
and wrote off considerable investments. The Atom is now all about network devices. –CL

Your Computer’s  
Memory Hierarchy
CPUs perform a lot of repetitive calculations 
and data accesses—it’s not a constant stream of 
new data. Small segments of code are repeated 
thousands of times, before moving on to the next 
block that gets repeated. The memory hierarchy 
optimizes the flow of data and instructions, a critical 
task for keeping the CPU fed with the data it needs.
Think of the CPU as the chef at a restaurant. 
People might order steak and potatoes, fish and 
chips, a salad, or any number of meals. Each uses a 
recipe that repeats the same sequence of ingredients 
and steps. A chef has limited resources, and can 
only use a few items at any time—cooking utensils, 
pots and pans, seasonings, ingredients, and so on. 
Whatever is in his hands can be used immediately, 
with commonly used items kept close by. But not 
everything can fit on the counters, so some things 
are in the cupboards, refrigerator, and pantry, and 
a larger storage area and meat locker might hold 
additional stock. And when supplies run low, orders 
are placed with markets and warehouses.
That’s sort of the high-level overview of the 
memory hierarchy. The hands of the CPU are called 
registers—they manipulate specific data at any 
given moment. Unlike humans, processors have 
way more than two hands. The x86-64 instruction 
set defines 16 integer registers, eight floating-
point/MMX registers, and 16 SSE/AVX registers 
The core of any modern Pc is the processor—it’s the brain that makes 
everything else work. But just like human brains, the processor 
depends on other components to keep things ticking along. One aspect 
of PCs that routinely gets mentioned, without digging into what’s really 
going on, is the memory hierarchy, so I want to discuss cache levels 
and other parts of the hierarchy, and how they relate to performance.
(plus a few others). So the CPU is 
like a 40-tentacled monster chef, 
each tentacle holding data and 
instructions that it’s ready to use, 
but even 40 tentacles isn’t enough, 
which brings us to the caches.
The L1 cache is close at hand, 
with an access delay measured in 
a few clock cycles (typically 4–5). 
The CPU tries to predict what data 
it needs next, and an L1 cache 
hit means there’s no delay with 
the number-crunching going on. 
L1 cache size is typically limited, 
usually 32K or 64K, to keep access 
times high. It’s a huge step up from 
the total register space of around 
512 bytes, but still relatively small.
L2 cache is a larger repository, 
with current CPUs using anywhere 
from 256K to 2MB. Unlike the L1 
cache, which usually has separate 
areas for data and instructions, L2 
cache holds both types of content. 
L1 and L2 cache are generally 
implemented on a per-core basis, to 
keep latency low, but the larger size 
makes searching the L2 cache take 
longer, around 12 cycles—and a 
2MB L2 cache would be even longer.
Last is the L3 cache (or on some 
CPUs, L4/eDRAM, but I’ll skip that), 
which is usually several times 
larger than L2 cache, and shared 
among all processor cores. Modern 
Jarred Walton has been a  
PC and gaming enthusiast  
for over 30 years.
Intel processors have anywhere 
from 2MB to 25MB L3 cache (more 
on server parts). AMD’s FX CPUs 
have 4MB or 8MB, but the APUs 
have no L3 cache; Ryzen has 8MB 
per four cores. L3 cache latency 
varies by the size of the cache and 
other factors, ranging from around 
35 to 60 cycles.
After the cache levels comes 
system RAM, which is like a local 
supermarket with a huge inventory. 
But you have travel there, grab 
what’s needed off the shelves, and 
pay at checkout. RAM accesses are 
measured in nanoseconds, with 
DDR4 memory requiring around 
50–60ns. That’s on top of the L3 
delay, so about 250–300 cycles for 
a 4GHz CPU to pull data from RAM. 
And heaven help your CPU if it has to 
wait on long-term storage, such as 
an SSD or HDD, where delays can be 
thousands of clock cycles.
So, next time someone starts 
talking about L3 cache or the 
memory hierarchy, picture our 
friendly monster chef, busy at work. 
Then overclock him, so he can keep 
up with the orders, because the 
apps are tired of waiting.
The CPU is like a 40-tentacled 
monster chef, each tentacle 
holding data and instructions.

LibreOffice is a far cry from the older and antiquated 
OpenOffice.org it’s forked from, and is a pillar of 
offline productivity on Linux. After all, it provides 
word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and 
presentation applications that enable you to get Real 
Work™ done. For years, LibreOffice served well as 
a drop-in replacement for Microsoft Office, with 
one big caveat: The user interface was kind of, well, 
fugly. And LibreOffice isn’t alone.
Sure, the program could read and do a reasonably 
good job of displaying and formatting Microsoft 
Office documents. Sure, it’s got Track Changes and 
other features. Hell, recent updates even introduced 
support for setting pre-defined and custom 
classification statuses for documents. (You can 
create classifications such as “SECRET/NOFORN,” 
for instance.) All of that is great, but it seemed weird 
with a default interface that looked like it was stuck 
in 2003. Custom icon themes and other tweaks help, 
but they can only go so far, and are a pain to set up.
While I remember the online gripes about the 
move to a “ribbon” UI in Microsoft Office, most 
people expect that interface nowadays. LibreOffice’s 
UI team finally arrived in this decade with the 
release of LibreOffice 5.3 in February. Even with 
the update, the new UI has to be enabled. (To do 
this, click “Tools > Options > Advanced,” check 
“Enable experimental features,” then click “View > 
Toolbar layout > Notebookbar.”) Even with the new 
UI layout, some of the default icons still seem a little 
dated or out of place (though you can always use 
your own icon theme).
A good UI is nothing to sneer at, even for 
a hardcore terminal junkie. A user interface 
determines how most people use an application and 
connect to it emotionally. As good as Nixnote 2 is as 
an Evernote client for Linux, the fact 
remains that the UI for Evernote 
on Mac OS X and Windows is much 
easier on the eyes. As beautiful 
as some GTK and Qt themes can 
be, they can’t always make up for 
lagging implementations or other 
shortfalls. The other main staple, 
GIMP, still uses GTK 2 (though 
porting to GTK 3 is on the v.3.0 
roadmap). Good design encourages 
the user to use the program, and 
gets out of the user’s way. Many 
Linux apps do this well, but some 
just aren’t there yet. And I get why: 
Function often trumps form in the 
world of open source.
Not everyone will clamor for the 
new ribbon (I, personally, like the

LibreOffice, Please  
Meet Office 2007
When you have a fresh Linux installation, you can count on a few basics. 
A browser, such as Firefox or Chromium, a mail client, and a file browser 
all come stock with a Linux desktop. LibreOffice is another of those 
included goodies, and it has become one of the core products in the world 
of desktop free software.

but it may prove a welcome feature 
for those making the switch over 
to a Linux system. It will take a 
while to get the new ribbon code 
and appearance polished, for sure. 
But once it’s looking good enough 
to be a default UI, it will be a lot 
easier to sell LibreOffice’s other 
merits to everyday people. However 
small, it’s certainly a welcome 
visual update, and I hope that it’s an 
indicator of better things to come

BY zak storey
Gaming is a common passion of PC enthusiasts, and it challenges manufacturers to 
continually push the envelope with their hardware. It’s not the only crux upon which 
computational performance sits, but it’s one of the biggest, raking in an astonishing 
$36 billion every year, so it’s easy to see why companies want a chunk of the pie. We spoke 
to PNY’s EMEA marketing manager, Jonathan Filleau, about how PNY is taking advantage 
of this, and what we’re likely to see from the Paris New York company this year.
PNY on Breaking into  
the Gaming Market
Jonathan Filleau reveals why gaming is important 
to the industry, and what PNY can bring to the table
Maximum PC: It’s fair to 
say PNY has traditionally been 
more oriented towards large-
scale businesses and design 
houses, things like that. Can 
you give us a little insight as to 
why you’ve decided to target the 
gaming market so aggressively 
in the last few years?
Jonathan Filleau:
So, basically, PNY has been 
working with gamers for 15 
years or so now. We are known 
both on the professional side, 
with the Quadro cards, of course, 
and on the gaming side, which 
used to be the Verto cards, and 
is now the GeForce category. 
We decided to invest a lot—I 
would say eight years ago—in 
the gaming industry, because 
we were looking at the trend, 
which was really growing. And in 
the last four years, we have the 
XLR8 brand, which is kind of a 
sub-brand within the company, 
pushing a lot of graphics 
cards—but not only graphics; 
DRAM, SSDs, and peripherals. 
And, at the end of the day, if you 
think about this, PNY is the only 
company in the market able to 
provide this full kind of access 
to all these components all at 
the same time. So this is why 
we decided to provide all of this 
to the market and invest in all 
these gaming solutions.
MPC: We’ve always been a big 
fan of your memory products, 
especially your DDR4, as it hits 
that sweet spot between price 
and performance that we all 
love. Talking specifically about 
SSDs, can you tell us how you go 
about designing a product, ready 
to go to market?
JF: So, the design process 
starts with a strong relationship 
with our internal engineers, and 
also with gamers. We take some 
of the gamers in house, from 
our own community, or from 
some people we are sponsoring 
with the XLR8 brand, and we 
talk about what they would 
want to use in their systems. 
Based on this kind of brief, the 
marketing team then works 
with the engineers, trying to 
find the right speed and the right 
firmware, because it is not just 
a question of speed, but also a 
question of firmware, and what 
you can provide with a product, 
and even what endurance you’re 
going to get. So, if you take the 
example of the CS2211 SSD, 
which is our gaming model, we 
spend a lot of time finding the 
right speed, which happens to 
Jonathan Filleau explains 
why PNY is so keen to crack 
the gaming market.

be 565MB/s and 540MB/s for 
the sequential read and write 
speeds, but we also have to 
spend time on tuning the right 
firmware and crafting the right 
packaging, to perfect the overall 
XLR8 environment.
MPC: Arguably, M.2 PCIe 
storage is now the next big thing 
when it comes to advancement 
in SSD speeds, so what are 
PNY’s plans regarding this 
platform change? How is 
the company going to take 
advantage of this form factor 
and connection standard?
JF: I’m quite glad that you 
asked that question, because 
today we’re really happy to 
announce a new product, which 
is the CS2030 M.2 by PNY. Of 
course, it’s NVMe compliant, 
because in our opinion, that’s 
absolutely a file formatting 
system that you need to be 
utilizing to be successful in this 
field. It’s M.2, of course. The 
speeds are 2,500MB/s read and 
1,500MB/s write speed. It’s a 
very high-speed drive, and it’s 
going to give an opportunity to 
our customers to install their 
operating system, if they have a 
motherboard that’s compatible, 
or a compatible laptop, on to the 
drive, and we strongly believe 
it’s going to be a part of the 
future when it comes to SSD 
storage. So, we’re going to get 
our storage setup solutions, and 
our M.2 solutions as well.
MPC: Is it likely that we’ll see 
any U.2 storage coming from 
PNY in the future, or is that a 
connectivity standard that’s 
going to be solely limited to Intel 
at the moment? 
JF: As of today, it’s not 
something we have on our 
development roadmap 
preparation. We don’t really 
feel the interest of U.2 at the 
moment on our roadmap, 
because it’s great if you want 
really, really crazy speed—so 
it’s really great if you’re looking 
for benchmarks—but at the 
end of the day, PNY is looking 
for the standard people, buying 
standard products for their 
system, for gamers, for high-
end gamers, and we strongly 
believe that M.2 is going to give 
the same type of results for a 
better price, so that’s why we’re 
not focusing on U.2 solutions.
MPC: Speaking of new 
connection standards and 
pursuits into other areas, is 
there any chance we’ll see PNY 
produce any AMD graphics 
cards going forward? Obviously, 
with Vega rumored to be 
releasing soon, that’s going to 
be a series of cards that are at 
the forefront of the minds of the 
vast majority of our readers, 
not to mention us hardware 
journalists, too.
JF: PNY has always had 
a really good historical 
relationship with Nvidia, and 
we’re really glad to work with 
it, with this company. Nvidia 
has always been the first one 
with the innovation and the 
technology, and always in 
advance of its competitors, 
which is exactly what the final 
customer and the gamer is 
looking for. So, this is exactly 
where we want to go, this 
is where we are, and that’s why 
we’re really happy to continue 
with Nvidia.
MPC: The XLR8 GTX 1080 
impressed us with its triple-
fan cooling, its plug-and 
play-design, and its general 
performance as well. However, 
I think a lot of us were a little 
disappointed there was no 
aftermarket software support. 
Is that something we may see 
any time soon?
JF: No, because PNY has 
always wanted to come with a 
ready-to-use solution for the 
final customer. So, that’s why 
our decision was to provide 
something that was already 
overclocked, ready to install, and 
ready to use. We are spending 
a lot of energy on the quality 
of the components and the 
quality of the PCB, and we are 
always following Nvidia’s PCB 
guidelines and design. So the 
hardware is really our part—for 
the software, we prefer to have 
everything fixed in place, to 
avoid any issues for the final 
customer, and have everything 
ready to use.
MPC: With Nvidia’s Volta 
allegedly launching later this 
year, can you give us any hints 
at all about what advances you 
will be introducing with your 
next generation of card? Is 
RGB lighting going to be there, 
for instance, or perhaps a new 
design of cooler?
JF: It’s very difficult for me 
to talk about them right now, 
because we don’t have access 
to those plans just yet. But what 
I can tell you is that compared 
to what we’ve just done with 
the XLR8 GTX 1080 and 1070, 
we’re going to continue to spend 
effort and marketing energy 
on the fans, on the cooling 
system, on the components on 
the card. So, if you look at our 
overclocked versions, this is 
something we’re going to do 
on our next generation. We’ve 
done triple fans on the GTX 1070 
and 1080, and dual fans on the 
GTX 1060 and 1050 Ti, so we’ll 
definitely still be working on 
that. RGB is a very interesting 
question—this is something 
we have in our development 
team, with our brainstorming 
sessions; this is something 
we’re definitely investing in, in 
the future, as we believe this is 
definitely something that can be 
added value on the graphics, but 
maybe also on those other kind 
of accessories.

THIS MONTH THE DOCTOR TACKLES...
↘ submit your questions to: doctor@maximumpc.com
Installing Windows 10
Hi Doc, I’m planning to build a 
desktop PC, and would like to 
know the best way to install 
Windows 10 on an SSD. I’m 
thinking about buying a 1TB 
Samsung drive based on the 
M.2 form factor. To start, I 
only want one, though I might 
upgrade later. The storage 
would likely drop on to an Asus 
X99 platform or something 
similar. I’m in the market for an 
Intel Core i7-6600K and 32GB of 
DDR4-2666, too. 
Please let me know how all 
of that would work together. I’m 
leaning toward purchasing a 
Windows 10 disc. –Ken Payne 
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Before 
the Doc gets to your question, 
Ken, there is no Core i7-6600K. 
There’s a Core i5-6600K, 
but it drops into an LGA 1151 
interface and is not compatible 
with Intel’s X99 platform 
controller hub. Perhaps you 
meant Core i7-6900K?
Microsoft sells Windows 10 
as a download or on a USB flash 
drive. If you choose the former, 
a media creation tool on the 
company’s site loads the ISO 
file on to a flash drive or blank 
DVD, enabling you to boot from 
solid-state storage or optical 
media, and install the OS. 
Asus sells several X99 
motherboards with M.2 
connectivity, and a 1TB 
Samsung SSD should be 
sufficiently roomy and fast.
Stuck in the Slow Lane
Hi Doc, I have an Asus VG278HE 
monitor that worked fine under 
Windows 7, but now I’m using 
Windows 10, the highest refresh 
rate it supports is 60Hz. Asus 
doesn’t have a driver on its 
website for Windows 10, and 
under the Device Manager, I 
see “Generic PnP Monitor.” I 
talked with Asus, and it wasn’t 
able to help. Naturally, I’d 
like to get my 144Hz setting 
back. After searching online, I 
found a couple of driver update 
programs, but I’m not sure if 
they are worth paying for. 
If it helps, I’m using an Asus 
ROG Maximus VIII Hero Alpha, 
an Intel Core i7-6700K, an MSI 
GeForce GTX 1070, and 32GB of 
G.Skill DDR4 RAM.  
–Craig M
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Don’t 
bother with a third-party driver 
update program. Simply head 
to www.nvidia.com, mouse 
over “Drivers,” and click 
“GeForce Drivers.” Choose the 
relevant options under “Manual 
Driver Search,” and snag the 
latest build for Windows 10. Get 
it installed, right-click on your 
desktop, and select the “Nvidia 
Control Panel.” Under “Change 
Resolution,” you should have a 
drop-down for “Refresh Rate,” 
and 144Hz should be available. 
If it isn’t, double-check you’re 
using a dual-link DVI cable 
between your graphics card 
and the monitor. None of the 
VG278HE’s other display inputs 
support 144Hz operation.
Refresh Rate Madness
Hey Doc. To start, I am 
incredibly frustrated with 
Nvidia’s hardware. Invariably, 
driver updates always result 
in a failure to install. I was 
dismayed that, when I replaced 
my GeForce GTX 970 with a 
GeForce GTX 1070 Sea Hawk, 
software on the bundled CD 
wouldn’t even load. I ended up 
accepting a Windows Update 
version just to use the card. Is 
there a more reliable way of 
updating my drivers that doesn’t 
involve hacking the Registry?
When I upgraded my video 
card, I also moved to a BenQ 
GW2075HT monitor. It is rated 
at 144Hz, but the best I can get 
from Windows is 70Hz. I am 
using the DisplayPort cable 
that came bundled with the 
display, and recently ordered 
a replacement in case this 
cable is defective. Do you have 
any other suggestions?
 
–Luis Kapel
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: It 
sounds like driver issues might 
be causing your monitor to 
not operate at its maximum 
refresh rate, Luis. Start by 
eradicating old driver files 
with DDU (Display Driver 
Uninstaller), available from 
www.wagnardsoft.com. Next, 
follow the guidance Craig M 
just received: Download the 
latest GeForce driver straight 
from Nvidia’s website, open 
the Nvidia Control Panel, and 
check for a 144Hz option under 
“Change Resolution.” 
The Doc wishes he could 
be of more help. There is no 
mention of a GW2075HT on 
BenQ’s website, and all of the 
company’s 144Hz-capable 
PC displays currently listed 
belong to the XL series. With 
that said, double-check your 
monitor’s model number and 
Most of Asus’s X99 mobos 
support M.2 solid-state drives.

specifications to make certain it 
does indeed support 144Hz.
Picking an Upgrade
Dear Doctor, I am a retired 
veteran who loves to play PC 
games. I’m currently using 
an MSI Z87-GD65 Gaming 
motherboard with an Intel  
Core i7-4770 processor that’s 
not overclocked. A GeForce  
GTX 780, 16GB of DDR3 
memory, a 512GB SSD, and an 
outdated 1080p Acer monitor 
are all plugged in.
I am thinking of upgrading 
the monitor, graphics card, 
and memory. As of now, I’m 
leaning toward a GeForce GTX 
1080, but I want to make sure 
my CPU won’t bottleneck it. 
Next question: What’s the best 
monitor for the money if I want 
to do 2K or better? Finally, 
what would be the best RAM 
upgrade? I have hit 100 percent 
too many times. 
 
–Peter Walkoviak 
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Thank 
you for your service, Peter. That 
MSI motherboard supports 
up to 32GB of memory, and if 
you’re seeing 16GB gobbled 
up today, the only solution is 
installing four 8GB modules to 
max it out. 
As for monitors, the GeForce 
GTX 1080 you’re eyeballing 
calls for a resolution of at least 
2560x1440. Anything lower 
would render the graphics 
card overkill. Although Nvidia’s 
G-Sync adaptive refresh tech 
adds a hefty premium to any 
display, if you’re willing to 
spend $500, Acer’s 24-inch 
XB241YU is a nice complement 
to the GeForce. It may even 
be worth stepping down to a 
GeForce GTX 1070, if that’s what 
it takes to free up extra cash for 
the best display possible.
The vanilla (non-K) Core i7-
4770 operates at a base 3.4GHz, 
and Turbo Boost pushes it up 
to 3.9GHz in lightly threaded 
workloads. MSI’s Z87-GD65 
Gaming does include a BIOS 
feature called Enhanced Turbo. 
Enabling it sets all four of the 
i7-4770’s cores to 3.9GHz, even 
under full utilization. Obviously, 
that won’t buy you as much 
performance as a newer CPU 
or an aggressive overclock, 
but a Haswell-based chip at 
just under 4GHz should be fast 
enough to prevent bottlenecks 
in most games.
Thumb Drive Recovery 
Hey Doc, I recently grabbed my 
favorite Corsair Flash Voyager 
GT to run a Linux partition again. 
I say again because I previously 
used it as an Ubuntu Installation 
Drive. Now, however, it appears 
useless. I’ve tried it in two PCs 
and with HP’s USB Repair Tool. 
Whenever the drive is plugged 
into a USB port, it shows up in 
the Device Manager, Explorer, 
and Disk Management, but it 
can’t be formatted, and double-
clicking on it results in an error 
that says no disk is inserted. I 
can only rename the stick. 
Corsair recommends 
sending it back, though that 
doesn’t seem worth the trouble 
for a 16GB drive. Does it sound 
as though something might be 
corrupted, or is it unreadable 
because it was formatted 
by Linux? 
–Ryan Pitts
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: It’s 
entirely possible that something 
is wrong with the drive. And 
the Doc agrees—when a 32GB 
Voyager GT sells for $25, 
there’s not much reason to 
jump through hoops getting a 
16GB model back to Corsair. 
But before you give up, dig a 
little deeper with Microsoft’s 
DiskPart utility, which is built 
into Windows. 
Start by plugging the drive in 
to a USB port. Under Windows 
8 or 10, move your mouse 
to the bottom-left corner of 
your desktop, right-click, and 
select “Command Prompt 
(Admin).” Type “diskpart” in 
the window, then hit Enter. 
Using the command “list disk” 
returns similar information 
as the Management Console’s 
Disk Management extension, 
but that should allow you to 
confirm your thumb drive’s disk 
number. Next, type “select disk 
x,” where “x” is the number 
corresponding to the Voyager 
GT. A message confirms the 
drive you picked. Double-check 
it’s correct because the final 
command, “clean,” removes 
all configuration information 
from the device, including its 
partition and data. If the drive is 
still good, you should be able to 
re-partition and format.
Favorite Flight Sims
Greetings, Doc. I grew up on the 
Atari 800 and ST/TT systems. 
When Atari died, I went with 
Windows (I just couldn’t stand 
the way Apple treated Digital 
Research and other Atari ST 
supporters). That was also the 
last time I even pretended to 
think I was a geek or knew what 
I was doing on a computer. 
I fell in love with the many 
outstanding air combat 
simulators that prospered in the 
Windows 95 to Vista era. They 
made this old USAF veteran 
feel at home in P-51s, Me 262s, 
and more. But shortly after 
Windows Vista hit the market, 
they started vanishing. None of 
them were 64-bit-capable, and 
their developers didn’t want to 
update them. All of my research 
suggests I shouldn’t bother with 
any of them; compatibility just 
isn’t there. The few success 
stories I’ve read were loaded 
with cumbersome Registry 
hacks and other workarounds I 
dare not try.
Please, are there any good 
Windows 7- and 10-compatible 
WWII sims you might consider 
plug-and-play? I did 20 years in 
Air Force blue. My father flew 
over Nazi-occupied Germany 
in B-17s and -24s. It breaks my 
heart that I can’t fly those skies 
and pretend he’s out there with 
me somewhere. 
I just finished building a new 
machine with an Intel Core 
i7-6850K, an EVGA GeForce GTX 
1080, 64GB of memory, a 1TB 
SSD, and, of course, Windows 
10 Home. 
–Gregg Anderson
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Although the Doc never got into 
flight sims, he has friends with 
projector-based wraparound 
displays and custom-built 
cockpits. The consensus seems 
to be that IL-2 Sturmovik: 
1946 remains one of the most 
popular sims out there, despite 
the fact it’s a decade old. 
According to the product 
page for IL-2 on GOG.com, 
Windows 7 and 10 are both 
compatible (though some folks 
report needing to launch it 
in Windows XP compatibility 
mode). The simulator does 
cost $10, but you also get a 
30-day money-back guarantee 
through the CD Projekt-owned 
distribution platform, should it 
prove too complicated to set up.  
Be sure you visit http://
forum.1cpublishing.eu after 
installing, and click on the IL-2 
Sturmovik community. Inside, 
you’ll find a number of sticky 
posts, including one that walks 
you through applying a long 
series of patches. Each patch 
is accompanied by a changelog 
detailing new content and bug 
fixes. The Doc is assured a lot of 
work goes into keeping that title 
fresh, so give it a shot. 
The $500 XB241YU isn’t 
cheap, but you’ll enjoy it 
for years to come.

A brave venture into fanless 
PCs and minimal noise By Zak Storey
Super 
silent 
SyStem
W
e have questions. Questions 
that 
need 
answering. 
OK, 
maybe not quite on the same 
level as Gandalf needing to know whether 
a certain golden trinket belonging to 
Bilbo Baggins was wielded by the dark 
lord Sauron, but we think they’re just as 
valid. After all, isn’t the advancement of 
technology and silent computing just an 
extended metaphorical allegory of that 
servant of Morgoth’s rise to power?
Too much? OK, back to something a 
little more rational. The questions of 
which we’re speaking are: Is it possible 
to build an almost fanless PC? One that 
has little, if any, capacity to generate 
noise? It’s a concept we’ve mused over 
ever since we crafted our Dream Machine 
in 2016. The Core i7-6950X located at the 
heart of our $10,000 build was cooled 
by a single (admittedly rather chunky) 
240mm radiator. Though, of course, it was 
surrounded by a plethora of other fans, in a 
somewhat open-aired chassis…. Combine 
that with our experience of benchmark 
testing, when we use little in the way of 
cooling on our open-air test bed, and you 
can see where these thoughts first arose.
The theory was simple, then: Take a 
high-end system—Core i7-6950X, 64GB 
of DDR4, and a Fury X—and combine that 
with soft-tube liquid cooling, including two 
360mm radiators (one extra-thick, and 
another still twice as thick as any AIO), and 
then add one of Corsair’s AX1200i power 
supplies, because the fan itself never 
spins under 50 percent load. If it works, 
fabulous. If not, then we can add fans 
at a later date to soothe this monster’s 
fevered wrath.
On top of that, there’s a few extra 
cautions we decided to include, just in case. 
From the get-go, we’d be using Be Quiet!’s 
phenomenally modular Dark Base Pro 
900 chassis. Its additional soundproofing 
and expansive liquid-cooling support are 
exceptional, and having the opportunity to 
mount fans stealthily at a later date meant 
we could truly take advantage of the 
interior space. And, of course, speaking 
of additional backup cooling, in case our 
theory fell through, we decided to test 
out another of Be Quiet!’s latest products: 
the Silent Wings 3 120mm high-speed 
fans. Specifically designed with radiators 
and static pressure in mind, these 
pressure pushers pump out an impressive 
3.37mmH2O at full speed, topping out 
at 28.6dBA, and come in a sleek black 
finish, too. Compare that with Corsair’s 
legendary SP120 series high-pressure fan 
at 3.1mmH2O and 35dBA, and you can see 
why we were intrigued by them. So, on to 
the build itself!

BeGInnInG Any lIqUID-CooleD BUIlD is always daunting. 
Mixing liquid with electricity goes against everything we’ve 
been taught, but there’s no denying that it’s by far the most 
efficient method of chilling beefy components. Right from the 
start, you need to plan carefully. You must establish exactly how 
many fittings you need, what components you have to cool, 
how you’re going to have your loop set up, and, of course, where 
you are going run your tubing. We’re going to take you through a 
step-by-step guide to how we put this particular build together, 
and hopefully inspire you to try it out yourself.
Precision 
cooling 
Procedure
1
STRIP The CASe
AFTeR yoU’ve SeleCTeD an adequate case, gathered your 
hardware, and made sure that the case itself supports the 
cooling you have in mind, the first thing you should do is strip 
the case of any unwanted hardware. Be Quiet!’s Dark Base 
Pro 900 was particularly in need of stripping down. There’s 
a plethora of hard drive bays located in the front of the case, 
and a 5.25-inch bay to contend with, too, all of which needed 
removing to allow room for our two radiators, pump, and 
considerable amount of hardware. Once removed, hold 
on to them, in case you do swap out your system at some 
later point. Right now, you should remove all the panels 
you can, including the roof, front, any dust filters, and side 
panels. Carefully place these in the box the chassis came 
in, preferably between the hard-foam packaging, to ensure 
they don’t get damaged.
You should also remove any unnecessary cables, and 
find a way of tucking the front I/O cables out of the way—
either tie them somewhere neat in the back with the 
included stock wire cable ties, or just tuck them out of the 
way until you need them later.
The reason we’re stripping the case down to its bare 
bones is that it makes life so much easier when it comes 
to the build process itself. You may notice from our 
photography that we haven’t taken all the panels off our 
case—this is purely for show, and to make the feature 
look a little more interesting than if we were working in 
completely stripped-down chassis.

TRy A TeST FITTInG
yoU CAn Do All The TheoRIzInG and planning in the world, but 
you won’t know what you have to work with until you have all the 
hardware. This is one of the biggest risks of water cooling, and 
often where you’ll find you need to purchase more kit. Even at 
Maximum PC, it takes us two or three orders each time we build 
a liquid-cooled system to get all the parts we need.
We suggest you install your motherboard in the system, 
without anything attached. Then place your power supply in as 
well (not necessarily screwed down), and take a look at where 
your radiators will go. 
This should give you time to line up your fittings, visualize 
your tubing runs, and alert you to any potential issues. For 
us, it was during this phase that we identified that we couldn’t 
install EKWB’s XE 360mm in the roof, because clearance 
for the motherboard was a major issue, so we decided to place 
the thicker XE at the front instead, and use the skinnier PE 360 
in the roof. Although still a little tight when it came to installing 
the two EPS power cables we 
needed at the top of the X99 
TUF, we could slide them in 
ahead of installing the mobo to 
resolve the issue, then install 
the radiator after that to solve 
the problem .

InSTAll The Key CoMPonenTS
ADD The RADIAToRS
FIT The PUMP
yoU ShoUlD InSTAll the two chunkier components first: 
the motherboard and the power supply. The good thing 
about a modular PSU is that it’s just a box with nothing 
attached, until you need it to be. In a chassis with a power 
supply cover, such as Phanteks’ Evolv or NZXT’s Manta, you 
can leave this until later; it’s only when you might need to 
run tubing across the PSU that you must install it first.
You can see in our build that the fan is facing up. This is 
for two reasons. Firstly, so we can make sure that the fan 
isn’t spinning while the system is under load, and secondly 
because it looks more interesting. That said, this PSU has 
been witness to a nasty water-cooling leak in the past, 
with a fitting on a Fury X giving way after it was knocked 
too many times. Because the power supply fan was facing 
down in that instance, no coolant entered the system, and 
the power supply survived.
TheRe’S A Few wAyS to install radiators—it depends on 
how patient you are, and what size radiators you’re fitting. 
The larger triple-fan behemoths require a little extra care. 
You can install the radiator to the panel, with a fan on the 
exterior, using long mounting screws, pinning the two with 
the case panel in the middle (on cases that support it). Or 
precariously mount the fans and the radiators on the inside 
of the chassis by threading those same long screws through 
the case panel, through the fan, and into the radiator. Or 
you can mount the radiator to the case on the inside, using 
every other screw, then mount the fans on the outside of the 
case panel using the remaining screw holes. That is if you 
want to have your fans set up in a push configuration. 
You also need to keep in mind where your G1/4-inch 
mounting points are on your radiators, and ensure you’ve 
got enough space to run your cables and fittings through.
nexT UP IS yoUR PUMP and reservoir. We recommend 
saving space and grabbing a combi pump/res, as it’s a lot 
less hassle. Manufacturers make a plethora of different 
sized pumps, but the smaller the pump, the higher the 
whine, due to a smaller sized fan running at higher RPMs. 
Pictured is EKWB’s EK-XRES 100 DDC 3.2 PWM Elite, 
with an XRES-250 reservoir. Some cases support reservoir 
or pump mounting, while others are less forgiving—in such 
a case, you can invest in a mounting bracket, as we did. The 
bracket is secured to the radiator, then you secure the pump 
to the bracket. If you intend to use the recessed G1/4-inch 
fitting on the pump/res combi, you need to use the included 
extender fitting, and if you intend to use a tubing run on the 
top of the res, you need to invest in a down tube as well. We 
suggest you use the in and out ports on the bottom of the 
pump, and use the top of the res as a fill port.

InSTAll yoUR CPU BloCK
ADD SoMe RAM
FIT The GPU
UnDeRSTAnD The FITTInGS
FoR A 2011 SoCKeT, once your CPU is locked in place 
with a dab of thermal paste, install the included 2011 
socket mounting screws, place the block on top, add the 
included spring to each stand-off, then screw it down 
using the included silver caps. Always secure these in 
a star configuration (bottom-left first, then top-right, 
then the other two points), to ensure you don’t damage 
the CPU by placing too much weight on one side.
For more mainstream CPUs, you have to do this prior 
to installing the mobo, as you need to attach a backplate 
to the board, thread the stand-off screws through it, 
attach the block, and secure it in the same way. There’s 
no wrong orientation to mount the block, but you want 
the coolest liquid flowing in the inlet, and out the outlet.
yoU’ve GoT yoUR RADIAToRS In, and your power supply 
and motherboard are installed, so it’s time to install 
the “smaller” components. RAM is first on the list. As 
you can see, we’ve also sneakily plugged in a few front 
panel headers now, plus the pump fan header, and 
have threaded the EPS power in, too, before getting too 
involved with the water cooling. 
We decided to use eight sticks of 8GB Corsair 
Dominator Platinums, so which slots to place these in 
wasn’t a big deal. However, if you’re using a kit of four, 
you must ensure you install the DDR4 into the correct 
matching channels. Fortunately, on most X99 boards, 
these are color-coded, and it's also obvious on any Z270 
or AM4 boards, because there are only four slots.
yoU PRoBABly Know how to install a GPU—make 
sure it’s lined up with the slot, the PCIe covers have 
been removed from the rear of the chassis, then gently 
slot it in. The biggy is the GPU block—the tricky part 
comes from removing the stock cooler. Work from the 
backplate first. Take a picture first for reference, then 
remove each screw, and keep them safe for future use. 
Work your way around to the rear I/O of the card, and 
remove the screws. Gently remove the fan cables on the 
PCB, then you should be able to pull the stock cooler off.
Remove the thermal paste from the GPU (the silver 
square), and any thermal pads (gray spongy strips) 
from the memory stacks and VRMs. Then follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions to mount your waterblock.
FITTInGS ARe one oF The BIGGeST expenses in a 
water-cooled system. Always buy two or three more 
than you think you need, and get some rotating 45- and 
90-degree fittings to help move things along. You also 
need the correct type of fitting for your tubing. For hard 
tubing, there are fittings with two rubber o-rings; for 
soft tubing, compression fittings are your best bet.
Look at the easiest routes from A to B. You’re trying 
to avoid unnecessary kinks in tubing runs, so use a 
combination of angled and straight fittings. Use plugs to 
block off unused ports on the reservoirs and graphics 
cards. And place a drain port at the lowest point—it 
makes life easier if you need to drain your system. Use 
a T splitter block and ball valve, and you’re all set.

InSeRT The TUBInG
SoRT oUT The CABlInG 
when IT CoMeS To SoFT TUBInG and hard piping, both have 
their merits, and both have their frustrations. Getting the 
bends just right on a piece of acrylic takes time to master, 
and can lead to many failed attempts. However, it’s also 
by far the easier of the two types to install and fix. Soft 
tubing, on the other hand, is easier to cut and line up, but 
a nightmare to install. In short, for soft tubing, get a length 
of tubing (make sure you purchase the correct outer and 
inner diameter of tube for the fittings you have), line it up 
between the two points, and cut off slightly more than you 
think you need. A pair of large, sharp scissors will do the 
trick, although you can buy tools specifically designed for 
soft tubing.
Next, you need to take a set of needlenose pliers, insert 
them in the end of the tube you’re attaching to the fitting, 
then stretch it outward. Do this in two different directions 
to give you a bit of slack to play with. Then install your fitting 
cap over the tube, and try to wiggle it over the barb on the 
compression fitting. Push it down until the tube is all the 
way up to the thread, then move the second part of the 
fitting up, and screw it into place. This compresses the tube 
and locks it into place. Repeat across your entire system, 
and you’re good to go.
we’Re FInAlly STARTInG to wrap up the system. For our 
build, we’ve already threaded the EPS power through, to 
allow for that tight mobo/top rad combo, so now it’s all 
about working the remaining cables around the back of the 
chassis, and into their allocated positions. Work around the 
tubing where you can. Unfortunately, in the Dark Base 900 
Pro, there is no PSU cover, so we’re going to go straight out 
the back with all the cables, bundle up the ones we don’t 
need, where we can, and tie them down to the chassis with a 
combination of cable ties and plastic-coated wire. It doesn’t 
need to look super-glamorous back there.
There are a few things you can do to enhance the 
appearance of your cabling. Cable combs, for instance, 
are a great addition to ensure your cabling looks clean and 
sharp, and most places that sell custom cable kits probably 
also have cable combs available, so bear that in mind 
when you’re building your system. With a modular PSU, 
everything else should be pretty straightforward.

TeST FoR leAKS
now CoMeS The FUn PART: filling the loop. But first, take 
precautions—paper towels are your best friend, so grab as 
many as you can, and place them around the system, above 
and below all your major fittings.
If you’ve followed us so far, you simply need to unplug the 
fitting at the top of your reservoir, attach a length of tubing 
with a fitting, then, either using a funnel or a squirty plastic 
sauce bottle, pour the coolant into the reservoir. It goes 
without saying that your entire system should be switched 
off at this point. You should be looking at adding coolant 
until the reservoir is around 70 percent full.
We’re a big fan of EKWB’s pastel coolant concentrate. It 
contains all the biocides and anti-corrosion inhibitors you 
need, and is easy to mix. Simply add one part concentrate 
to two parts tap water (or deionized water, if you really want 
to be jazzy), and you’re set.
FIRST, PReP yoUR PoweR SUPPly. Remove the PCIe power 
from your GPU, unplug your EPS power from the mobo, then 
unplug your 24-pin ATX power. Keep your pump plugged 
into its Molex power, but unplug the pump fan header. Make 
sure your PSU is off and unplugged. Now, you can either 
buy a 24-pin ATX bridge from Newegg for $10 (XSPC ATX 
PSU Bridge Tool), or bridge the PSU yourself—use a paper 
clip or piece of plastic-coated copper wire, strip the plastic 
off each end, and with the retention clip of the 24-pin ATX 
cable facing down, bridge the fourth and fifth pins from the 
right, on the bottom row of pinouts. During the next step, 
do not touch the wire. Plug your PC in, and switch on the 
PSU. Run the system for a few seconds as the pump cycles 
the coolant around. Don’t let the pump run dry, as you’ll 
damage the bearing. Refill the res, and cycle the pump until 
you have a continuously flowing liquid-cooled system.
AnD voIlA! You now have a fully running liquid-cooled 
loop. We suggest you run it like this for at least 24 hours, to 
make doubly sure there’s no leaks, using the paper towels 
as indicators. Once this is all wrapped up, you can plug all 
of your hardware back in, and get to testing and installing 
your operating system. Overall temperatures should be far 
lower than any AIO can muster—especially under load—
and the absence of fans on your graphics card ensures a 
super-silent system.
What you’re left with is, in our opinion, a masterpiece. 
Are water-cooled machines easy to build? There are a few 
extra steps involved, but if you take your time, plan it well, 
double-check everything, and do your research ahead of 
time, you shouldn’t go wrong. Arguably, it’s the mistakes 
we make that teach us the most, but when you’re messing 
around with $1,500 processors, they’re something you 
generally want to avoid.

not that you can see it here, but 
the tubing that runs from the top 
radiator to the front radiator utilizes 
four separate 90-degree fittings to line 
up just right, just behind the pump/res.
 
This length of tubing running 
from the front radiator to the 
pump/reservoir combo’s inlet port 
also serves as a drain valve, using a 
ball valve fitting, two male to male 
connectors, and a T splitter.
located along the front and top 
of the case, the two adhesive RGB 
leD strips allow us to change the white 
coolant to any color we like, with just a 
quick click of a front-panel button.
There’s no other backup hard 
drives located anywhere in this 
build, but the 2TB Samsung 960 Pro 
hidden under the motherboard’s armor 
packs enough wallop for us.
DID oUR venTURe into a quick and easy 
fanless system work? Sort of. Idling and on 
desktop, the system can go all day without 
a flutter. However, during benchmarking, 
we encountered issues. After 52 minutes 
of testing, the processor reached its Tj max 
of 100 C, and, boy, were those radiators hot. 
For short bursts, the benchmarking process 
was fine, but if you intend to render for any 
length of time (beyond 20–30 minutes, at 
4GHz), issues would soon become apparent. 
That said, the processor didn’t throttle 
under load, and remained at 4GHz turbo. 
When we added Be Quiet!’s Silent Wings 
fans to the interior radiators, temperatures 
dropped dramatically, and remained stable 
at around 55 C throughout our benchmarks, 
even while running under lower RPMs. 
This suggests that airflow is the important 
factor. We still managed to keep the 
system excruciatingly quiet, with the fans 
registering less than 9.8dBA at 33 percent 
speed. Ramping that up to 66 or 100 percent 
via the TUF X99’s onboard fan controller 
improved temperatures by up to 8 C, but it 
did increase noise levels notably.
We also decided to see what would 
happen if we swapped from a fully positive 
airflow system to a more balanced system, 
with the three fans at the front on the 
XE360 drawing air into the case, and the 
three on the PE in the roof exhausting 
instead. Overall, we didn’t see any massive 
temperature difference, with most results 
being well within the margin of error.
Using soft tubing was a godsend—it’s 
easy to manipulate, and with enough 
angled fittings, generally isn’t an issue. 
It’s worth mentioning just how vital those 
fittings are: We did a similar feature way 
back in 2015, utilizing a Core i7-5820K and 
the Fractal Define S chassis, but routing 
the soft tubing was a nightmare compared 
to this build, even making the hard tubing 
NZXT Manta easy in stark contrast. 
So, to answer the question, can a high-
end, silent, passive rendering workstation 
be achieved? Sadly, at this moment in time, 
we don’t believe so. That said, with a little 
thought and some neat cooling, you can 
optimize a system to be near-silent, and 
that’s close enough in our eyes.

master the powershell

Discover how to get started with Microsoft’s 
powerful scripting tool, with Nick Peers
Master the 
Powershell
a
t first glance, the Windows 
PowerShell looks to be a 
facsimile of the Command 
Prompt, but to dismiss it as 
such leaves you missing a huge trick. In 
fact, PowerShell is a platform designed 
to automate many Windows tasks through 
a clever scripting language. It’s based on 
the .NET Framework, which gives it lots 
of flexibility and scope, particularly when 
you access it through the PowerShell 
ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment) 
program, which provides even more 
useful 
tools 
and 
shortcuts—such 
as 
syntax highlighting and IntelliSense tab 
completion—to help you build the perfect 
script to achieve what you want.
If you’ve already dabbled with the 
Command Prompt—and .bat batch files in 
particular—you’re already well on the road 
to getting to grips with PowerShell. Many 
familiar commands work in PowerShell, 
too—thanks to a clever aliasing system, you 
can type a Command Prompt command and 
it’s automatically translated into the correct 
PowerShell command.
In this article, we’re going to introduce 
you to the PowerShell from the perspective 
of someone who’s not encountered it before, 
and is interested in discovering what it may 
or may not be able to do for them. We’ll 
make some fairly basic assumptions—
you’re aware of how programing and 
scripting work, for example—but we will 
start at the beginning, teaching you the 
fundamental building blocks of PowerShell. 
In the process, we’ll reveal what “cmdlets” 
are and how they work, plus you’ll discover 
how to stitch them together to form fully 
functional commands, gently easing you 
into the world of scripting. We’ll also 
introduce the basic syntax and structure 
of the language, while providing you with 
some real-world examples to try.
You’ll find out how to install the latest 
version of PowerShell in older versions of 
Windows, discover how to get help, and find 
some of the best online reference guides. 
You’ll also learn about setting up profiles, 
and gain useful tips and tricks to help you 
start to use PowerShell to make your own 
computing life that bit more easy. Ready to 
start on the road to becoming a PowerShell 
guru? Let’s go!
We’ll begin by opening PowerShell—if 
you’re running Windows 7, 8, or 8.1, check 
the box over the page to obtain the latest 
version. Click the “Start” button, and scroll 
down the “All Apps” list until you locate the 
“Windows PowerShell” folder. Click this 
to reveal two (or four if you’re running 64-
bit Windows) options: “PowerShell” and 
“PowerShell ISE.” Let’s start with the basic 
PowerShell command prompt, so select

“PowerShell.” This launches the application 
with non-administrative privileges, and 
places you in your own personal user 
folder, just like the Command Prompt. 
Right-click the shortcut, and choose “Run 
as Administrator,” and it places you at  
C:\Windows\System32. It goes without 
saying, though, that you shouldn’t run 
PowerShell as an administrator unless you 
specifically need to. For the purposes of this 
tutorial, we’re going to stick to running it as 
a regular user, except where stated.
The PowerShell window opens, providing 
you with a similar—at first glance—
interface to the regular Command Prompt. 
You can customize the view by right-clicking 
its menu bar and choosing “Properties” to 
reveal a tabbed window. The options are 
broadly identical to the Command Prompt—
use the “Font,” “Layout,” and “Colors” tabs 
to customize its look and feel.
To help you plot a route through 
potentially maze-like commands, the text 
changes color as you type different parts 
of the command: cmdlets and aliases are 
yellow, with parameters displayed in white, 
and flags (switches preceded by the – (dash) 
symbol) in gray. Variables are displayed in 
green, and text strings in dark blue.
As an aside, you can change these—and 
other message colors—if you don’t like 
them, but those options are edited using 
PowerShell commands. We’ll look at them 
in more detail later on.
First  
stePs
PowerShell is about 
building 
blocks. 
Those 
blocks 
are 
known as “cmdlets.” 
They’re called this to 
differentiate them from commands as used 
by the Command Prompt. In the Command 
Prompt, commands either refer to specific 
programs, such as chkdsk.exe or edit.com, 
or are “internal commands” related to the 
main command.com program (for example, 
“dir” and “mkdir”).
Cmdlets work in a different way. 
PowerShell works through the .NET 
Framework, so cmdlets are actually 
instances of .NET Framework classes, 
not standalone executable files. What 
this means in practice is that cmdlets 
rely on PowerShell to handle the parsing 
of commands, plus provide any error 
presentation and output formatting.
Furthermore, while commands are 
designed to work on their own, cmdlets can 
work in isolation, or be used in combination 
with others to create more feature-
complete commands. Cmdlets can be split 
into various types, enabling you to mix and 
match with precision to get the results you 
need. Indeed, with some practice, you’ll be 
able to build complete applications from 
just a few dozen lines of code.
CMdlets  
unCovered
All cmdlets follow 
the same structure: 
verb-noun. So you 
have 
“Get-Alias,” 
“Clear-His tor y,” 
“Set-Location,” and so on, which helps 
make them easier to grasp. The verb part of 
the cmdlet reveals what it’s designed to 
do—for 
example, 
“Get” 
cmdlets 
are 
designed to retrieve data, while “Set” 
cmdlets are used to establish or change 
data. “Format” cmdlets format data in a 
particular way, and “Out” cmdlets are 
designed to direct your command’s output 
to a specific destination, whether that’s the 
screen, a file, or somewhere else.
Many cmdlets have abbreviated aliases, 
too. These are shortened forms of the 
cmdlet—for example, “clhy” refers to 
“Clear-History,” the command for deleting 
all entries from the command history. 
Others link back to the Command Prompt, 
to make it easier for those with experience 
of the command line to migrate across to 
PowerShell. For example, “cd” refers to 
“Set-Location,” which is used to change 
the working directory in PowerShell, while 
“dir” is the alias for “Get-ChildItem,” which 
is used to list the files and folders in the 
Get PowerShell
We’re featuring the 
most recent release of 
PowerShell—version 
5.1—and it comes pre-
installed with the latest 
version of Windows 10. All 
you need to do is launch 
it, either from the Start 
menu’s “All Apps” list, or 
by typing “powershell” into 
the “Search” box. You can 
then right-click its Taskbar 
icon and choose “Pin to 
Taskbar” for a convenient 
shortcut going forward.
Windows 8 and 8.1 users 
currently use PowerShell 
4. If you want to upgrade 
to version 5.1, simply 
download the correct 
version—x86 (32-bit) or 
x64 (64-bit)—from https://
msdn.microsoft.com/en-
us/powershell/wmf/5.1/
install-configure. Double-
click it, and follow the 
installation prompts.
Windows 7 ships with 
an even older version of 
PowerShell, dating back 
to 2009. To upgrade that, 
you first need to verify 
the .NET Framework 
4.5.2 is installed (a link to 
it is provided at the site 
above, or you can install it 
through Windows Update). 
Once done, download 
the relevant x86 or x64 
standalone installer file 
(around 65MB), then 
double-click it, and again 
follow the prompts.
Once installed, you’re 
prompted to reboot, so do 
so, and impatiently wait 
for Windows to reload. 
Then it’s a case of simply 
opening PowerShell in the 
usual way—via the “Start” 
menu or by pressing Win-Q 
in Windows 8 to open the 
Search charm. The latest 
version powers up (you can 
verify this by checking out 
the copyright notice, which 
should now read “2016,” 
rather than “2009” or 
“2012”), and you’re ready 
to delve into PowerShell 
without missing out on all 
the latest improvements 
and new features.
To see what’s new, 
click “New Scenarios and 
Features” on the download 
page for version 5.1, and 
also check out the “WMF 
5.0” link, where you’ll 
discover major features 
introduced since Windows 
7 and 8 were released.
Upgrade to the 
latest version.

current directory. To list all aliases, use the 
“Get-Alias” cmdlet on its own, like so:
 > Get-alias
Add “alias” to the end, substituting 
“alias” with your chosen alias, to get a 
specific command. For example:
 > Get-alias dir
To find out more about what specific 
cmdlets 
and 
aliases 
can 
do—and 
see examples of them in action—use 
PowerShell’s help commands. The box on 
page 41 reveals what you need to know.
You can also create your own aliases 
using the “function” cmdlet—we touch on 
this in the profiles box on page 42.

Just 
like 
regular 
Command 
Prompt 
commands, cmdlets 
are controlled using 
various parameters 
(also referred to as switches and flags). The 
“Help” box on page 41 reveals how to identify 
what a cmdlet’s parameters are, and what 
they do, plus see some examples.
PowerShell also supports variables, 
which should be preceded with a $ string. 
Each variable is defined on its own line, and 
then that variable can be called later on. For 
example, try the following lines:
 > $Bill = 100
 > $taX = 20
 > $total = $Bill + $taX
 > “Your final bill is” +$total
As an aside, you could write “Your final 
bill is $Total” and that would work, too, 
because PowerShell is smart enough to 
recognize that $Total is variable. On other 
hand, if you wanted to write $Total as a word 
and not the variable, use ‘Your final bill is 
$Total’ instead. (More on command syntax 
in a minute.) You’ll come across a special 
variable ($_) that may or may not precede

something else, such as “$_.status.” This is 
a placeholder, and we’ll look at it later.

PowerShell 
uses 
standard 
scripting 
operators 
to 
help 
build 
commands— 
everything 
from 
commas to separate items in a list, to 
enclosing text strings in double quotation 
marks (as you saw earlier, PowerShell is 
smart enough to identify variables inside 
quote marks). There are also some handy 
conditional operators you can use when 
creating conditional statements. Use “-eq” 
to mean equals, and “-ne” to mean not 
equal. Enter “-gt” for greater than (and 
“-ge” for greater than or equal), or “-lt” and 
“-le” for less than or less than or equal.
The pipe symbol—“|”—combines two or 
more commands in a single line of code. It’s 
used to “pipe” the output of one command so 
it becomes the input of the next command. 
If you type “ping pcgamer.com” you’ll see a 
list of text describing the results—now type 
the following command:
 > Ping pcgamer.com | select-string  
 packets | out-File tempfile.txt
This pings pcgamer.com as before, but 
this time it searches the output for lines 
containing “packet,” then saves them 
into a tempfile.txt file, which it saves to 
the current working directory. Open File 
Explorer to locate the file—it contains a 
single line of text, something like “Packets: 
Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss).”

specific conditions are met. Like all good 
scripting 
and 
programing 
languages, 
PowerShell supports this through “If” and 
“Else” statements (as well as variants, such 
as “ForEach”). The basic structure for 
conditional commands is this:
 > if (condition) {perform task if   
 condition is met or true}
You’ll see two different types of 
bracket have been referenced here. Use 
parentheses (regular brackets) for required 
options within the loop. Your conditions can 
include “-And,” “-Not,” and “-Or” flags 
to provide more complex conditions. For 
example, the following performs the task if 
either test1 or test2 conditions are met:
 > if (test1 -or test2) {perform task}
Replace “-Or” with “-And,” and both test 
conditions would be required; change it to 
“-Not,” and test1 would need to be met and 
test2 specifically not met for the task to run.
Curly braces—{}—can also be used for 
block expressions within a command that 
explicitly looks for a condition to be met. For 
example, the “Where-Object” cmdlet allows 
you to filter data returned by other cmdlets, 
as the following example demonstrates:
 > Get-service | where-object {$_.status  
 -eq “stopped”}
This produces a list of services on your 
PC that aren’t currently running. The “$_” 
placeholder enables you to capture the 
output of “Get-Service” without having 
to run the command again. The “status” 
portion of the variable is a specific child 
property linked to “Get-Service.” You can 
find out what these are using the “Get-
Member” command, like so:
 > Get-service | Get-Member
Last, but not least, you can also use 
square 
brackets—[]—which 
represent 
optional elements that aren’t required for a 
cmdlet to run. For example:
 > Get-service [w]*
This produces a filtered list of services 
that begin with the letter “w.” Square 
brackets 
are 
also 
used 
for 
certain 
math functions.
Put it all 
toGether
You 
can 
combine 
cmdlets, 
variables, 
parameters, 
and 
syntax to perform 
quite complex tasks 
with what amounts to not very much code. 
The following example provides a complete 
list of aliases, their associated cmdlets, and 
available parameters, sorted by cmdlet 
name rather than alias. Look closely, and 
you should see some logic—the “sort” 
command 
clearly 
refers 
to 
“ResolvedCommand” (the cmdlet name), 
for example, while the “Get-Help” cmdlet 
pulls the information about each cmdlet’s 
parameters. Finally, the “Format-Table” 
cmdlet is used to output the results neatly 
over three columns. 
 > Get-alias | select name, 
 resolvedCommand, @{  
 name=”description”; exp={ Get-help $_  
 | select -expandProperty synopsis }} |  
 sort resolvedCommand | Format-table  
 -wrap
Before we move on, having to type these 
commands in full can be time-consuming, 
but here’s a handy shortcut: start typing a 
cmdlet, then press Tab to auto-complete 
it—if more than one match is found, keep 
hitting Tab until your cmdlet is displayed, 
and press Shift-Tab to cycle back through 
the list in case you miss your target.

CMdlets
Let’s introduce some 
more cmdlets. An 
exhaustive A-Z list is 
beyond 
us, 
so 
bookmark the “Task-
Based Guide to Windows PowerShell 
Cmdlets” at https://technet.microsoft.com/
It’s possible to create quite complex commands by combining cmdlets together.
PowerShell’s cmdlets can perform a huge variety of tasks.
PowerShell can 
also be used 
to manipulate 
services and 
processes.
Using pipes enables you to direct 
output from one cmdlet to another.

There’s plenty of help—
offline and online—waiting 
for you with PowerShell. 
The obvious place to start 
is with its own built-in help 
tools. Type the following:
 > help cmdlet
Replace “cmdlet” 
with your cmdlet’s or 
alias’s name. You’ll 
receive a prompt that the 
more detailed help files 
require installing, but 
to avoid a string of error 
messages, first close and 
restart PowerShell as an 
administrator, then type:
 > Update-Help
A green progress bar 
appears, and then the files 
are added, one module at a 
time—don’t be surprised to 
end with an error message 
or two, which can be safely 
ignored. Close and restart 
PowerShell again.
Now the help files have 
been replaced, use the 
following command:
 > Get-Help cmdlet
You can add some handy 
parameters: “-detailed” 
(“Get-Help cmdlet 
-detailed”) provides a list 
of all available parameters 
for that cmdlet, plus 
examples of them in action. 
Use “-examples” if you only 
want to view examples. 
One downside of the help 
file is that you need to keep 
scrolling back to reference 
it; add “-online” and it 
opens in your browser, 
enabling you to view it side-
by-side while coding.

advice holds true, and it

The “ConvertTo-HTML” cmdlet is crude, but effective nonetheless.
en-us/library/dd772285.aspx. It’s organized 
into tasks under such groups as “Dates and 
Times,” “Files and Folders,” “Help and 
Information,” “Scripting Techniques,” and 
“System Administration Tasks.”
First up, the “Get-Date” cmdlet lists 
the date and time—use the “-displayhint” 
parameter, and specify either date or time 
to filter the output. You can also use “Get-
Date” to specify a variable using date/time 
format, and to perform various forms of 
time- or date-based arithmetic, using such 
parameters as “AddSeconds” through to 
“AddYears.” The following is a handy way to 
quickly calculate time offsets for different 
parts of the world:
 > (Get-date).addhours(-5)
Next, use “Copy-Item” to copy files or 
folders to a new location—you need to 
specify the source, then the destination. 
Use the wildcard (*) character to copy all 
files in a folder to the location, or “*.doc” to 
restrict it to copying only specific file types:
 > Copy-item c:\users\nickd\documents\ 
 scripts\*.ps1 c:\users\nickd\downloads\test\
Related file-based cmdlets include 
“Remove-Item” 
(delete), 
“Move-Item,” 
“Rename-Item,” and “New-Item” (create a 
file or folder—use the “-type” parameter to 
specify “file” or “directory’ respectively).
We’ve touched on using “Out-File” to 
record a command’s output to a text file, but 
what if you want to append a string of text 
to an existing file, instead of creating one? 
The “Add-Content” cmdlet does just that. By 
default, it appends your string immediately 
after the last character in the file, but it’s 
likely you’ll want to append it to a new line, 
so precede your text with “`n,” like so:
 > add-Content c:\users\nickd\ 
 documents\text.txt “`nthe end”
Want to output your command to a web 
page? Use the “ConvertTo-Html” cmdlet 
in a piped command, in conjunction with a 
“Get-” command and “Set-Content” (which 
does the actual writing of data):
 > Get-Process | Convertto-html | set- 
 Content c:\user\nickd\downloads\test.htm
PowerShell can be used to manipulate 
services (and processes), using a number 
of different cmdlets. Available commands—
all self-explanatory, and requiring you 
to run PowerShell as an administrator—
include 
“Start-Service,” 
“Stop-
Service,” 
“Restart-Service,” 
“Suspend- 
Service,” and “Resume-Service.” These 
need to be followed by the service’s name 
as stored in the Registry—if you don’t know 
this, use the “-displayname” parameter, in 
conjunction with the name of the service, as 
it appears under services.msc:
 > restart-service -displayname “File  
 history service”

Build a profile
By default, everything you 
set up in PowerShell—
variables, functions, and 
other customizations, such 
as the color of warning 
messages—is lost when 
you close the current 
session. If you’d like to 
preserve this across 
multiple sessions, you 
need to create a profile. 
First, display the path to 
the Windows PowerShell 
profile by typing:
 > $profile
 > test-path $profile
This reveals that the 
profile will reside in your 
Documents folder, while 
the second command 
returns a value of “False,” 
indicating that the profile 
doesn’t yet exist. To create 
a profile, type:
 > new-item -path $profile  
 -itemtype file -force
Type the following to 
open it in Notepad:
 > notepad $profile
A blank document is 
opened, ready for you to 
record your variables and 
other customizations. 
For example, to change 
the warning message as 
outlined in the main text, 
add the following three 
lines of code:
 $a = (Get-Host).PrivateData
 $a.WarningBackground  
 Color = “red”
 $a.WarningForeground  
 Color = “white”
Add the following line, 
and you can edit your 
profile simply by issuing 
the command “pro” into 
PowerShell going forward:
 function pro {notepad  
 $profile}
Save the file in Notepad, 
then close and reopen 
PowerShell—your 
customizations should 
be in place. It basically 
works like a script file, but 
is loaded each time you 
launch PowerShell. It only 
affects PowerShell when 
you run it as the current 
user—if you want to create 
a profile that affects all 
users and shells, simply 
launch PowerShell as an 
administrator instead. The 
profile is stored inside the 
Windows\System32 folder, 
and applies to all users of 
your PC.
Make your customizations stick.
majority of services that don’t support being

We have touched on 
how cmdlets work 
best when used in 
conjunction 
with 
others 
to 
form 
complete commands. Here’s a practical 
example of how to use PowerShell to 
change the message colors it displays, with 
the help of the “Get-Host” cmdlet. Start by 
typing the following, to see how PowerShell 
currently displays warning messages:
 > write-warning “alert!”
You’ll see the message is displayed as 
yellow text on a black background, which is 
fine, unless you’ve modified the background 
and font colors, as outlined earlier. So 
how do you go about changing it? Easy. We 
use the “Get-Host” cmdlet to extract the 
current properties of the command window 
using its “PrivateData” property (which is 
anything but private—oh the irony):
 > $a = (Get-host).Privatedata
 > echo $a
This reveals no fewer than 10 child 
properties for “PrivateData,” including two 
referring to warning colors. We can then 
change these, like so:
 > $a.warningBackgroundColor = “red”
 > $a.warningForegroundColor = “white”
Now try the “Write-Warning” cmdlet 
again. Note, however, that the changes won’t 
survive the current PowerShell session—
close the window and open it again, and 
you’re back to the original settings. This 
leads us on to the concept of PowerShell 
profiles, which you can find out more about 
in the box on the left.

Scripting is a way of 
storing and running 
multiple commands 
from a single file. 
Command 
Prompt 
scripts are written as plain text files, and 
saved using the .bat extension. Each 
command is placed on a separate line, and 
they’re run in sequence when the batch file 
is called from the Command Prompt by 
navigating to the directory the script is 
stored in, typing its name—”script.bat,” for

PowerShell ISe
Once you’ve got to grips with the basics, 
we recommend switching to coding, and 
developing scripts using PowerShell ISE 
(search for “ISE” in the Windows search 
box). It opens to a multi-pane window: 
the console window appears to mimic the 
basic PowerShell interface, but comes with 
some hidden extras. First, you can input 
and edit multiple lines of code at once—hit 
Shift-Enter to add an extra line. 
Second, as you start typing cmdlets, the 
Snippets feature automatically suggests 
commands to enter (select them with 
the arrow keys, then a list of supported 
parameters for the selected cmdlet is 
displayed; press Tab to insert the cmdlet). 
Right-click the console window, and choose 
“IntelliSense” for an even more helpful 
tool that suggests parameters, parameter 
values, and even files and folders.
You’ll see a functional menu bar with 
lots of options related to scripting, and 
the elusive script window can be brought 
into view by pressing Ctrl-R. Snippets and 
IntelliSense work inside here, too, and 
you can run all your script by pressing F5, 
plus save it to disk for future use. You can 
also run just a small portion of it—select 
the code in question, then hit F5 to run it in 
isolation from the rest of your script.
The Command panel on the right offers 
an alternative, interactive way of inserting 
cmdlets. Select one from the list for a 
description, then click “Insert” to insert 
it into your console, or click the “Show 
Details” to view all available parameters. 
Select one or add in any required 
information, then click “Insert” to insert a 
fully formed command into the console.
Finally, you can expand ISE’s capabilities 
by choosing “Add-Ons > Open Add-Ons 
Website” to browse community-written 
snippets that add different types of 
functionality to ISE.
your script resides in the same directory 
you’re currently in, use the following:
 > .\filename.ps1
If you need to call it from another 
directory, use the following syntax:
 > & “c:\users\nickd\script.ps1”
The first time you attempt this, you’ll 
receive an error message telling you 
that scripts can’t be run. This is down to 
PowerShell’s security policy, which is set 
to “Restricted” by default. You can change 
this policy within PowerShell, but you need 
to exit and relaunch it as an administrator to 
do so. Once done, type the following:
 > set-executionPolicy -executionPolicy  
 remotesigned 
Press Y, and hit Enter when prompted, 
and try running your script again. This 
time, it should work—”RemoteSigned” 
basically allows all local scripts, as well as 
downloaded scripts that have been signed 
by a trusted publisher, to run. 
While you can create scripts by hand in 
a text editor, Windows provides all the tools 
you need to build and test .ps1 scripts in 
PowerShell ISE, which provides a more fully 
rounded experience, and is geared toward 
making it easier and quicker to write, test, 
and run scripts. Check out the final box for 
an overview of how it works. 
You’ve now started on your journey to 
tapping into scripting using PowerShell and 
PowerShell ISE. We’ve barely scratched 
the surface, but you should have enough 
of a grounding to strike out on your own. 
To help you move on to the next level, visit 
https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/
ScriptCenter, where you’ll find thousands 
of 
script 
resources 
for 
PowerShell. 
They’ve technically been written for IT 
professionals, but you’ll find plenty of 
examples that you can make use of as a 
regular user, too—for example, the “Reset 
Windows Update Agent” script enables you 
to attempt to fix problems with Windows 
Update from the PowerShell interface.
Before we go, one final use for 
PowerShell (run as an administrator) is to 
remove Windows Store apps from your PC. 
Use the following syntax:
 > Get-appxPackage *appname* |  
 remove-appxPackage
Substitute “appname” with the name of 
the app you wish to remove, and they’re all 
up for grabs, even built-in apps ignored by 
Apps & Features. To get a full list, use:
 > Get-appxPackage -alluser | Format- 
 list -Property PackageFullname 
There are loads of great PowerShell scripts online, such as this one, which can help fix issues with Windows Update.

NiNe thousaNd of your hard-earned 
dollars would buy you this behemoth. 
It’s a gaming notebook—if you can call it 
that—unlike any other. A titan in its field. 
The pinnacle of all you could possibly 
achieve with the laptop form factor. 
Packing an arsenal of the latest 
hardware, of which even the most 
exuberant PC enthusiast would be 
jealous, the 21 X sits on the cusp of a 
new concept: that curved screen. Sitting 
in front of you is a 21:9 superwide, IPS, 
G-Sync, curved screen, with a resolution 
of 2560x1080.
Powering 
that 
screen 
are 
two 
GeForce GTX 1080s operating in SLI, 
fully capable of being overclocked on 
demand, simultaneously co-ordinated 
by the phenomenal processing power 
of Intel’s Core i7-7820hK, a four-cored, 
eight-threaded Kaby Lake powerhouse 
of a chip. On top of that, there’s 64GB of 
DDR4, two Samsung 256GB PCIe SSDs 
operating in RAID 0, and a chilling cooling 
solution consisting of no fewer than five 
separate fans, most of which are Acer’s 
patented aluminum design.
But it’s raw power that tames the 
beast, so does the 21 X compete? The 
answer, rather unsurprisingly, is yes. 
Although not quite at the same level as its 
desktop counterpart, it hammers frames 
into the ground in quick succession with 
that superwide screen, making gaming 
on this truly beautiful. 
The 21 X is, admittedly, for a select 
few. It’s designed for people on the move. 
Tournament players. Those who want 
the pinnacle of laptop performance. 
And although its meaty design may be 
off-putting to many, there are others for 
which it’s the epitome of everything that 
makes PC gaming what it is. –ZaK stoReY

Jeremy Laird asks, what is 3D XPoint? 
A supercharged flash alternative or the 
gateway to 100GHz optical computing?
Is 3D XPoint 
Intel’s  
secret  
weapon?
I
s Intel’s new 3D XPoint tech the biggest 
paradigm shift in computing since 
the introduction of silicon chips? Is it 
merely the basis of faster SSDs? Or is 
this story nothing more than a combination 
of vaporware and conspiracy theories? 
3D XPoint is one of the most mysterious 
technologies to come out of Intel in years. 
The first products derived from it are 
imminent, yet we don’t fully understand 
what it is or how it works. It’s not even 
totally clear what it’s really intended to do.
Partly that’s down to a lack of clarity on 
Intel’s (and its partner, Micron’s) behalf. 
The messaging has been mixed, both in 
terms of the intended applications for 3D 
XPoint, and the insight Intel has provided 
into its technical underpinnings. It’s 
the latter, in particular, that has fueled 
speculation. Nature abhors a vacuum, and 
into the space created by equivocation has 
flowed extensive conjecture.
Is 3D XPoint the basis for a whole new 
approach to chips, with chalcogenide 
and phase-change materials replacing 
silicon and the transistor? Does it open 
the door to fully integrated on-chip optical 
computing? Will it smash the circa-
4GHz ceiling on CPU speeds, achieving 
frequencies in hundreds of gigahertz?
Meanwhile, 
rumors 
abound 
of 
corporate 
maneuvering 
and 
even 
skulduggery. Is the patchy technical 
insight an attempt to protect valuable and 
vulnerable intellectual property? Could 
Intel be playing down the true value of 
3D XPoint, while it scoops up the relevant 
patents, ensuring a lucrative lockdown 
on the next age of computing? Could 
there be an intentional cover-up involving 
infringement of third-party patents?
Heady stuff. Getting to the truth, 
however, isn’t easy. All we know is that the 
first 3D XPoint products will take the form 
of non-volatile solid-state storage, sold 
under the new Intel Optane brand. But even 
here, there’s scope for confusion. The first 
Optane drives aren’t intended to replace 
system memory or hard drives. Instead, 
they’re somewhere in between—a kind of 
fast cache designed to act as a buffer in 
front of the relatively slow performance 
of an SSD containing NAND flash memory. 
With that, let us begin….

Intel’s 3D XPoint 
Optane drives are 
nearly here...

MAXIMUMPC

The structure 
of 3D XPoint is 
surprisingly 
simple.
Intel is making 
big claims 
for 3D XPoint 
performance.
w
hen 3D XPoint was first 
mooted, it was exciting 
simply as a new memory 
technology, 
let 
alone 
as the foundation for a whole new 
approach to computer chips. The 
industry has spent decades trying to 
cook up a new non-volatile storage 
technology with which to improve 
upon flash memory. Finally, here it is.
The sales pitch was stellar. In 
early presentations, Intel said 3D 
XPoint was up to 1,000 times faster 
and 1,000 times more durable than 
existing NAND flash memory. Even 
by the standards of the chip industry, 
for which exponential improvements 
over time are the norm, that kind of 
one-off step change is exotic.
The 
commercial 
reality 
isn’t 
proving quite so spectacular. The 
first retail products based on 3D 
XPoint are just about to hit the market 
under Intel’s Optane branding, and 
expectations have been scaled back 
dramatically. Specific performance 
data hasn’t been released. But Intel is 
talking about Optane drives being up 
to 10 times faster than a conventional 
SSD. Still a big jump, but perhaps 
rather more plausible.
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. 
First, let’s lay out what we know 
about 3D XPoint. Currently, there are 
two prevailing memory technologies, 
if we’re talking integrated circuits 
rather 
than 
magnetic 
memory 
solutions, such as a hard disk. RAM 
or system memory is super fast and 
effectively lasts forever, but requires 
a constant electrical current. NAND 
or flash memory is non-volatile, so 
maintains data integrity without a 
power supply, but at the expense of 
speed and durability.
There are a few other details that 
separate the two, such as memory 
cell size and power consumption, both 
of which are relatively poor with RAM. 
But the holy grail for the last 20 to 30 
years has been to develop a memory 
technology that combines the best of 
both: speed and durability with non-
volatility. Several technologies and 
even whole companies promising just 
such a solution have come and gone 
over the past few decades. But 3D 
XPoint is arguably the first that really 
looks like it’s going to stick.
It’s actually the work—or at least 
the property—of two of the biggest 
players in computer chips in general, 
Intel and Micron. The former is 
best known today as a maker of PC 
processors. But Intel’s genesis was 
actually as a maker of memory. Its 
first product was in fact DRAM, or 
dynamic random access memory, 
which remains the basis of system 
memory in PCs and other computing 
devices today. Micron, meanwhile, is 
well known as a maker of all kinds of 
memory, from sticks of DDR to solid-
state drives, many of which sell under 
its Crucial retail branding.
Although 3D XPoint may eventually 
end up replacing both DRAM and 
NAND, for now it’s the latter that 
begs the most obvious comparison, 
not least because it, too, is a non-
volatile memory type. But there are 
huge differences thereafter. NAND, 
for instance, stores data by trapping 
electrons in an insulated floating 
gate. Thus, each memory cell is a 
sort of capacitor, with the charged 
or discharged state representing a 
bit of data.
3D XPoint, by contrast, is a 
resistance-based technology that 
uses bulk property change to the cell 
material to alter its resistance level, 
and so record a memory state. When 
you drill right down to cell level, 3D 
XPoint also has a remarkably simple 
structure. There’s the memory cell 
itself, a switch or selector element, 
then the connecting wires. And that’s 
really it. The cleverness comes in the 
materials, and how it’s all arranged.
c
urrently, Intel and Micron 
haven’t 
revealed 
all 
the 
details, leaving space for 
speculation as to the full 
implications 
of 
the 
technology. 
But what is clear is that the bitline 
and 
wordline 
connecting 
wires 
are arranged above and below the 
cells, and laid perpendicular to one 
another, in a grid pattern, hence the 
“XPoint,” or crosspoint, moniker.
There 
are 
some 
immediate 
benefits that come out of all that. 
For starters, the simplicity of the 
structure, including the notable lack 
of a transistor, makes for excellent 
cell density. In other words, you 
can pack in more data, especially

The first Optane 
drives are  
M.2 items.
Get a load of the 
first 3D XPoint 
wafers....
It’s going to be a while before 
we’ll be able to uncover the 
full implications of Intel’s 3D 
XPoint tech. But we do now 
know what shape the first 
products will take. At CES in 
Las Vegas, earlier this year, 
Intel divulged initial details of 
its first 3D XPoint products.
To be sold under the new 
Optane brand, we’re talking 
solid-state storage in the 
M.2 form factor, and initially 
16GB and 32GB capacities. 
Somewhat oddly, the 
marketing pitch for Optane 
has involved the shortcomings 
of using a “spinning hard disk” 
for data storage. That’s true, 
of course, but the fact that 
Optane drives are solid state 
and faster than magnetic hard 
drives surely isn’t what sets 
them apart. It’s the distinction 
compared to existing solid-
state drives that makes 
Optane interesting.
Whatever, Optane drives 
are being pitched as a disk 
drive cache memory option 
for its seventh-gen Kaby Lake 
processors and platforms. 
To quote: “Intel Optane 
memory is a revolutionary 
new memory technology that 
affordably accelerates your 
system, delivering high speed 
and responsiveness without 
compromising system storage 
capacity. When combined 
with a large storage drive, 
the Intel Optane memory 
M.2 module accelerates 
computer performance, 
while maintaining 
capacity. You’ll be 
amazed at how fast 
applications launch 
or new games install. 
Together, Intel Optane 
memory and a seventh-
generation Intel Core i-series 
processor deliver a snappy 
PC experience with short 
boot times, fast application 
launches, extraordinary 
gaming experience, and 
responsive browsing.”
You will, as we understand 
it, need the full Kaby Lake 
package to use an Optane 
drive. That means a Core 
iSomething-7xxx CPU and 
a motherboard with Optane 
support, based on Intel’s new 
200 Series chipsets. Exactly 
what we can expect in terms of 
performance boosts, whether 
Optane will play nicely with 
both HDDs and SSDs, and so 
on isn’t yet clear. Our guess 
is that the very first products 
could be underwhelming, and 
will be held back by things like 
the controller technology and 
other specifics related to the 
early implementation. But, 
with any luck, we’re no more 
than mere months away from 
revealing 3D XPoint’s first 
tranche of secrets.
Intel’s oPtane:  
3D XPoInt Is go for launch
compared to DRAM. What’s more, 
the “crosspoint” wiring means the 
data is addressable at individual bit 
level. This has all kinds of upsides 
compared to NAND flash, which must 
be read and written in large blocks.
The 
latter 
is 
a 
reasonable 
approach when reading or writing 
large chunks of data, but it quickly 
becomes inefficient with random 
access workloads involving high 
frequency requests to read and write 
little snippets of data. The net result 
is that you end up reading and writing 
large amounts of redundant data. By 
enabling bit-level access to data, 3D 
XPoint has NAND flash dramatically 
beaten for speed and latency.
As we mentioned earlier, 3D 
XPoint is also claimed to offer up to 
1,000 times better endurance than 
NAND. That makes for something in 
the order of a few million write-erase 
cycles, or hundreds of petabytes 
of writes overall, and hundreds of 
terabytes of writes per day. So, for 
most users, an SSD using 3D XPoint 
technology could be considered to 
last forever. It will never wear out.
Overall, the broad picture for the 
first implementation of 3D XPoint in 
Optane drives puts its capabilities 
roughly between DRAM and NAND, 
but arguably closer to the former. It’s 
far faster than NAND, but not as fast 
as DRAM. Likewise, it’s much denser 
than DRAM in terms of data storage, 
but not quite as dense as NAND.
If that’s what we know for sure 
today, how will 3D XPoint deliver in 
the future, and could it really be the 
beginning of a new age of computing? 
In the short to medium term, it seems 
fairly certain that Optane drives will 
transition from cache drives into 
general storage. The first Optane 
products have been announced at 
16GB and 32GB capacities, using a 
production node roughly equivalent 
to 20nm transistors (without any 
transistors, direct comparisons of 
feature size become quite subjective), 
reflecting the relatively high cost 
of the very first 3D XPoint chips. 
Prices haven’t been announced, but 
as Intel and Micron get to grips with 
production, we expect to see the cost 
come down fairly rapidly. Within a 
couple of years at most, Optane drives 
measuring hundreds of gigabytes 
and more should be available at 
prices normal consumers can afford.
It’s everything beyond that where 
things get complicated. For instance, 
co-CEO Guy Blalock of the IMFT Intel-
Micron joint venture responsible 
for 3D XPoint has said, “3D XPoint 
specifically offers a path to provide 
massive 
amounts 
of 
memory 
storage at a latency rate sufficient 
to place it in close proximity to the 
CPU.” Intriguing, but what does it 
actually mean? It’s not exactly saying 
that 3D XPoint is poised to replace 
DRAM. But it’s also placing it in an 
51

unambiguously different position in 
the system hierarchy compared to 
existing solid-state drives. Overall, 
it points to a new class of memory 
that’s difficult to currently define.
e
ven 
more 
significantly, 
however, could 3D XPoint 
be the basis of a new age of 
post-silicon computing? At 
this point, a warning is required. Much 
of what follows is highly speculative, 
though the scope for speculation is at 
least in part due to Intel and Micron’s 
failure to provide clarity on some of 
the technical details.
Much of the speculation revolves 
around the materials and operational 
specifics of 3D XPoint. Some earlier 
speculation implied it depended on 
phase-change physics to store data, 
an approach that has been under 
evaluation for non-volatile memory 
for 
some 
time. 
Phase-change 
memory is built around a material 
known as chalcogenide glass, which 
sports some pretty funky properties. 
In simple terms, chalcogenide can be 
switched between amorphous and 
crystalline solid states or phases, 
courtesy of applying an electrical 
current. What’s more, a number of 
distinct intermediate states can also 
be achieved. Amorphous versus 
crystalline gives you 0 and 1 for the 
storage of a single bit, obviously. The 
intermediate states allow for multiple 
bits of memory per cell.
Multiple 
companies, 
including 
IBM, Samsung, Numonyx, and Intel, 
have been working on phase-change 
memory, or PRAM, for some time. 
However, Intel and Micron have 
repeatedly denied that 3D XPoint 
depends upon phase-change physics. 
For instance, when UK tech site The 
Register put the question to Micron 
regarding 3D XPoint’s use of phase-
change materials, it was told, “3D 
XPoint technology is a new class of 
non-volatile memory invented by Intel 
and Micron that relies on resistance 
change of the bulk material to achieve 
non-volatility. Unlike phase-change 
memory, 3D XPoint technology uses 
a unique cross point architecture, 
enabling it to scale in ways that 
phase-change memory has not been 
able to accomplish.”
That’s 
a 
pretty 
unambiguous 
denial that 3D XPoint is a phase-
change memory technology. So, 
why are we even discussing it? How 
about this quote in reference to 3D 
XPoint, again from Guy Blalock of the 
IMFT? “Chalcogenide material and 
an Ovonyx switch are magic parts 
of this technology, with the original 
work starting back in the 1960s.” So, 
3D XPoint is a chalcogenide device, 
and builds on its development of that 
material in a computing context since 
the 1960s, which has been primarily 
centered 
on 
its 
phase-change 
properties. All very confusing.
This is where the conspiracy 
theories come in. Are Intel and Micron 
Is the end nigh for Moore’s 
Law? You could certainly 
make that case. After all, it’s 
true that the computer chip 
industry has had a tricky few 
years of late, keeping up with 
the pace of progress that 
Moore’s Law implies. 
Lest you have forgotten, 
Moore’s Law is simply the 
observation that transistor 
densities in integrated 
circuits tend to double every 
two years. Put another 
way, Moore’s Law says 
computer chips either double 
in complexity and thus 
performance, or halve in 
cost—or some mix of the two, 
depending on what you’re 
after—every couple of years.
It dates back to the 
1960s or 1970s, depending 
on the precise part of the 
technological folklore you 
want to focus on. But the point 
is that it undeniably proved 
prescient for several decades. 
More recently, it’s come into 
doubt. Whether Moore’s Law 
has really hit a wall will only 
become clear several years 
from now. What we can say 
is that big players like Intel 
and TSMC—the latter being 
the foundry responsible for 
making most AMD and Nvidia 
GPUs in recent memory—have 
missed several self-imposed 
targets when it comes to 
new production nodes and 
shrinking their transistors.
The situation has become 
acute enough for Intel to 
abandon its so-called Tick-
Tock cadence of a new CPU 
architecture and production 
process in alternating years, 
as dictated by Moore’s Law. 
Instead, Intel has switched 
to a three-year cadence 
of process, architecture, 
and optimization. 
Meanwhile, it’s also 
undeniable that CPU 
operating frequencies have 
hit something of a wall around 
roughly 4GHz. In the good 
old days when MHz ruled, 
CPUs would benefit from 
both process shrinks and 
increased frequencies. Not 
any longer.
It’s just possible, however, 
that 3D XPoint’s chalcogenide 
underpinnings could reboot 
Moore’s Law, at least for a 
time. The structure 
is completely 
different, so 
the fact that 
transistor 
gate 
sizes are 
running up 
against the laws of physics 
suddenly becomes irrelevant. 
3D XPoint’s chalcogenide 
devices don’t use transistors. 
Likewise, chalcogenide 
devices have at least the 
theoretical potential to hit 
insanely high frequencies, 
well beyond those seen in 
commercial silicon chips. 
Whether any of this becomes a 
practical reality, only time will 
tell. But it’s fun to know that 
it’s possible we’re on the cusp 
of a new wave of computing.
rebootIng Moore’s law
Is Intel’s Kaby 
Lake CPU family 
the last of a 
dying breed of 
silicon chips?
Intel is certainly making impressive performance claims 
for its new Optane drives.

The first of its Ryzen CPUs 
have launched, and the 
early indications are that 
the new architecture is 
going to sock it straight 
to Intel with CPU models 
up to eight cores, and 
therefore give $1,000 Core 
i7 CPUs a run for their 
money at less than half 
the price.
Intel, of course, will 
hardly be blown out of 
the water. It’s been taking 
things very easy in recent 
years, and has quite a bit 
of performance in hand. 
It can easily up its game, 
and no doubt will. But 
there’s also a chance 
that 3D XPoint could give 
Intel a killer advantage, 
even without taking into 
account the more exotic 
end of the spectrum of 
possibilities that involve 
3D XPoint-derived 
technology replacing 
CPUs wholesale.
Instead, we’re talking 
about what’s required 
to make the most of 3D 
XPoint as a memory and 
storage technology with 
conventional platforms 
and silicon processors. As 
we’ve seen, 3D XPoint has 
the potential to deliver a 
huge jump in solid-state 
storage performance. The 
benefit of that is obvious, 
but it’s also theoretical. A 
storage technology that’s 
10 times faster than NAND 
simply has no way to talk 
to the CPU on existing 
platforms without either 
a huge performance hit 
or soaking up bandwidth 
that’s critical for other 
components like graphics. 
That’s the problem.
Instead, to make 
the most of 3D XPoint 
technology, new on-
CPU interconnects 
and controllers will be 
needed. It goes without 
saying, Intel will be far, 
far better placed to design 
and implement them 
than AMD. It’s not hard 
to imagine Intel shipping 
CPUs with on-package 
dollops of 3D XPoint  
memory measuring tens 
or hundreds of gigabytes, 
and offering stellar 
storage performance, 
thanks to clever caching 
features, for instance.
Maybe the solution will 
be along the lines of a new 
type of memory controller 
and data addressing, 
which can neatly speak 
to RAM and 3D XPoint 
memory in parallel, in 
some kind of shared 
memory space. Either 
way, at best AMD would 
be years behind, playing 
catch-up. If Intel can 
lock AMD out via patents 
or similar intellectual 
property restrictions, 
on the other hand, AMD 
could be out of the 3D 
XPoint game altogether, 
and with devastating 
consequences.
Does 3D 
XPoInt sPell 
DooM for aMD?
obscuring 3D XPoint’s phase-change 
properties with a view to sidestepping 
patents they don’t own? Could it be 
a double bluff, in which they imply 
that it’s phase change by indicating 
that the core tech is chalcogenide, 
because they’re either in the process 
of acquiring patents for something 
else, or know it can’t be protected 
and want to give themselves as big 
a head start over the competition as 
possible? Who knows?
w
here things get even 
more 
speculative 
is 
3D XPoint’s role as a 
candidate 
technology 
for 
non-memory 
devices. 
Some 
commentators 
speculate 
that 
transistor-less chalcogenide devices 
similar to those used in 3D XPoint 
memory cells are good candidates 
for replacing the transistor itself, and 
could operate at speeds far higher 
than silicon chips. Switching speeds 
measured in hundreds of gigahertz 
are mooted, and the simplicity of the 
internal structure could allow for 
additional scaling in device density, 
too. Put the two together, and you 
have a roadmap that keeps the 
computer industry rolling for some 
time, just when conventional silicon 
chips are increasingly running up 
against the laws of physics.
Another more specific avenue by 
which 3D XPoint might be implicated 
in new approaches to computing 
involves 
optical 
technology, 
or 
photonics—using light, rather than 
electrons, as the basis for computing. 
Photonics, 
of 
course, 
already 
exists as a computing technology, 
most obviously as a superfast data 
interconnect in the form of fiber 
optics. The fact that light is the 
ultimate in high-speed comms is a 
hint of its broader potential. Indeed, 
much of the backbone of the Internet, 
which is built out of fiber optics, 
depends on just that potential.
The argument as it relates to 3D 
XPoint, photonics, and computing 
goes something like this: Currently, 
integrating photonics into a computing 
platform requires dedicated chips. 
It’s not possible to put silicon 
photonics on to the same chip as a 
high-performance computing circuit 
like a CPU. However, chalcogenide 
devices, according to some, solve 
that problem. Indeed, chalcogenide 
photonics is a science all of its own.
Taking the discussion any further, 
unfortunately, is almost impossible. 
We simply don’t know whether Intel 
and Micron have plans beyond solid-
state memory when it comes to 
3D XPoint. It’s true that the use of 
chalcogenide devices is extremely 
novel, but even the best qualified 
engineers and scientists can’t say 
for sure where the limits lie for 
chalcogenide as a candidate material 
for replacing silicon and transistors.
If Intel and Micron have made some 
major breakthroughs, the only thing 
you can be sure about is that they’d 
be keeping their cards close to their 
chests until they were either certain 
they had the relevant intellectual 
property on total lockdown or, if 
that wasn’t possible, until they were 
absolutely ready to launch products. 
The truth will out eventually. Watch 
this space. 
Intel’s existing photonics 
tech is limited to heavy-duty 
interconnects.
The failure of Thunderbolt to 
deliver an optical interconnect 
hints at the difficulties with 
silicon photonics.
There is speculation that 
transistor-less chalcogenide 
devices are candidates for 
replacing the transistor itself.

dreaming 
of copper
I’m grateful—incredibly so—for what 
my job enables me to do. Working at 
Maximum PC is phenomenally good 
fun, and being in a position where I’m 
continuously surrounded by some 
of the most powerful hardware in 
the world allows me to build some 
amazing machines, the likes of which 
I used to only dream of.
That said, it does tend to mar 
my views on the world of hardware, 
with particular emphasis on what’s 
“enough.” I’ve had four separate 
systems this year, yet with each and 
every one, there have been niggling 
problems, whether it’s fan noise, not 
enough processing power, or other 
irritating issues. My current S340 dual 
GTX 1080 is no different. This time, the 
problem lies with the GPUs. Frankly, 
it’s only a small annoyance, but they 
tend to get a little toasty. Perhaps it’s 
because I’m averse to running my 
intake fans any higher than 40 percent; 
or perhaps it’s because there’s just not 
enough airflow in the chassis.
Either way, I’ve come up with a 
solution, and it’s another stab at water 
cooling. Yep, that means you’re going 
to be getting at least one more feature 
this year on chilly liquid substance 
abuse, before we jump into the titanic 
attempt that is Dream Machine 2017. 
So, what will I be looking at this time 
around? Copper tubing, nickel plating, 
and one meaty-looking Phanteks 
Enthoo Evolv.

BACKGROUND
Oculus finally catches up with the big boys with the release of 
its ultra-responsive Oculus Touch controllers. Requiring a 
second IR camera and featuring a whole mess of tactile and 
capacitive input options, these controllers are bound to be 
chock-full of IR LEDs and tons of exciting tech—but we’ll only 
know for sure if we tear them down!
MAJOR TECH SPECS
•  An additional Oculus Sensor
•  A Rockband adapter
•  Two IR-emitting Touch controllers, with finger tracking and a 
mess of buttons
KEY FINDINGS
•  Using our fancy IR-viewing technology, we get an Oculus 
Sensor’s-eye view of the Touch controllers. While the twin 
black plastic halos are featureless to the naked eye, our 
camera sees the double rings of infrared LEDs residing 
beneath. The LEDs, like those present in the headset, are 
arranged in distinct patterns, allowing the Oculus Sensor to 
pick out the headset and two controllers, and determine their 
position and orientation. Also, thanks to the not-quite-round 
shape of each controller, the sensor ought to be able to tell 
left from right—even after you’ve crossed your arms while 
playing Disappointed Parent Simulator 2016.
•  The battery panel is secured by a pretty hefty magnet, and 
packs a rubber bumper to keep the battery itself nicely in 
place. Said battery is a non-rechargeable but perfectly 
standard AA type, which you can replace with a rechargeable 
at the first opportunity. Better this than a glued-in battery!
•  There are some hidden screws, but even after removing 
them, we’re not getting anywhere. Looking around for 
another point of attack, we decide the top is as good a place 
as any. Smelling glue, we turn up the heat! Prying up the 
control surface reveals gobs of glue, and the cause of our 
troubles: another hidden screw.
•  Uncovered, the single-cable LED array peels off fairly easily 
after being disconnected. All 22 IR LEDs are conveniently 
labeled, and there’s even a barcode. Cross your fingers for 
Oculus-provided replacement parts! Digging deeper into the 
handheld’s handle, we find a cute little power distribution 
board—that we can’t remove without a soldering iron. 
•  Repairability Score: 5 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). 
Battery replacements are quick and easy, with a magnetic 
cover being the only barrier to entry. There are only T5 and T6 
Torx screws in the Touch controllers, making screwdriver 
selection seamless. Accessing the Touch controller internals 
requires fighting through a layer of adhesive. The joystick, 
button bases, and battery connections are soldered to a 
board and require soldering knowledge to repair. Navigating 
through the tabs, adhesive, and hidden screws is not 
intuitive, and could result in damage during disassembly. 
Oculus 
Touch
More torque screws than 
you could shake a VR 
controller at.
Hopefully, the LEDs 
will be easy to replace 
when damaged.

Secure Your Backups 
With nCrypted Cloud
1
First steps
Make sure you’ve installed the software for your chosen cloud 
service(s) before you set up nCrypted Cloud. It supports five 
major providers: Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, and Egnyte.
>> Head over to www.encryptedcloud.com/apps, where you’ll 
find a link for the Windows client. Click and save the installer to 
your hard drive, then double-click the setup file, and follow the 
prompts [image A]. File Explorer will restart, so don’t panic when 
the screen temporarily goes black. Once complete, leave “I don’t 
have an nCrypted Cloud account” selected, and click “Next.” Fill 
in the form, ignoring the prompt for a work email at the bottom. 
Remember to set a strong (but memorable—forget this and your 
data is toast) password, then check the terms of service box. Click 
“Next,” and wait while a recovery key is generated. When prompted 
to enter your organization’s name, click “Skip,” followed by “Finish.”

tweAk initiAl settings
nCrypted Cloud scans your PC for any recognized cloud 
providers, and automatically links to them—you’ll see a 
File Explorer window open, pointing to the nCrypted Cloud folder, 
inside which are shortcuts to each cloud provider. Don’t panic—
nCrypted Cloud hasn’t started encrypting any files yet, so before 
EvEr wondErEd just how secure your data is when you upload it to the cloud? Providers such as 
OneDrive and Dropbox make a big song and dance about the fact your data is encrypted, but who 
holds the all-important encryption keys? If those keys are stored with your data, as is the case with 
most cloud providers, it leaves one glaring weakness in your secure backup plan.
If you’re serious about protecting your data, you need to add extra layers of encryption to it that 
aren’t left in the hands of your cloud storage provider. nCrypted Cloud separates your encryption 
keys from your data, and one of those keys (the UPK—or User Personal Key) never leaves your 
client devices. Your cloud provider has no access to your key, and nCrypted Cloud has no physical 
access to your data, neatly closing that particular security loophole.
nCrypted Cloud works with all major cloud providers, and tucks in lots of useful tools and 
features to keep inconvenience down and security up. Read on to discover how to add a much-
needed extra layer of security to your data. –nick peers

you go further, review which providers have been linked, 
and verify you’re happy with the choices made.
>> If you want to exclude any, look in the Taskbar’s 
Notification area for the nCrypted Cloud blue padlock-
like icon. Right-click this, and choose “Preferences” to 
access the main “Settings” screen. Switch to the “Account” 
tab, where you’ll see a list of providers [image B]—simply 
deselect those you wish to exclude, and click “Apply.” You’re 
prompted to confirm each change by clicking “Yes,” then 
entering your nCrypted Cloud’s username and password.

You’re ready to add that extra layer of protection to 
your cloud-hosted data. To see how it works, enter 
your cloud folder in File Explorer, and locate a small folder. 
Right-click it, and choose “Make Private,” clicking “Yes” 
when prompted. You’ll see a progress bar as nCrypted 
Cloud encrypts the folder using AES 256-bit encryption, 
then the folder icon refreshes to show a blue padlock. 
This padlock is added to each file and subfolder inside the 
folder, too, making encrypted files easy to identify.

the change and upload the encrypted content to your cloud

storage, overwriting the unprotected files. To verify this, right-click 
your cloud storage app’s Taskbar Notification area icon, and choose 
“View online” (or similar) to access it through your web browser. 
Each file is now encrypted as a zip file, and is accompanied by an 
“nCrypted Cloud Readme” file. Click this to be told the folder has 
been protected, complete with a link to the nCrypted Cloud website. 
People can download the zip file, but they can’t access its contents 
without the unique password assigned to it (see the box on right).
4
work with enCrypted Files
This confirms that the files are now protected by a second 
layer of encryption, so inaccessible to anyone even if they 
somehow gain access to your cloud provider account through the 
web. Look carefully at the file in File Explorer, however, and it 
appears to be unchanged. Double-click it, and it opens in the usual 
way. If you right-click an encrypted file and choose “Properties,” 
however, you’ll see it’s now identified as a zip file (switch to the 
“nCrypted Cloud” tab and the file’s actual properties are revealed, 
including its size) [image C].
>> What’s happening? The nCrypted Cloud app on your PC is 
invisibly decrypting any files you open, then encrypting them again 
once they’re closed—including any saved changes. There’s a slight 
pause with larger files, but otherwise the process is seamless.
5
limitAtions
One major limitation of nCrypted Cloud is that some 
applications can’t access your encrypted files from their 
traditional “Open” dialog boxes. Those that use the latest Windows 
“Open/Save” dialog box, which contains the same Navigation pane 
found in File Explorer, have no problems opening files, but older 
programs that use a different style of dialog—typically with a 
“Places” bar, listing five basic shortcuts—can’t access files within 
protected folders; instead, they simply see the encrypted zip files (if 
they see anything at all).
>> To work around this problem, you need to open the file from 
within File Explorer— right-click, and choose”Open with…” to select 
your target app, if it isn’t already the default for that file. Similarly, 
when you save files in these applications, they’re saved without 
encryption—to fix this, right-click the file (or its parent folder, if 
there are a lot of files to process), and choose “nCrypted Cloud > 
Re-apply policy” (or “Make Private,” if that option isn’t present).
6
more enCryption options
The “Make private” option can also be applied to individual 
files within your cloud folder when you right-click them 
[image d]. Sadly, you can’t select multiple files or folders at once 
C
to make them private—presumably for safety reasons—
so you have to wade through your folders one at a time. 
Should you later wish to make files or folders publicly 
available again, right-click them as before, but this time 
choose “Remove Privacy,” clicking “Yes” when prompted.
>> If you move a file from one folder to another within 
your cloud folder, you get a warning telling you the policy of 
the file will be changed to your name. This isn’t important 
unless you’ve set up multiple identities, which is beyond 
the scope of this tutorial, so ignore it.
>> If you try to move or copy the file outside of your cloud 
folder by dragging it to another folder or drive, you end 
up transferring the encrypted zip file instead. Just drag it 
back into your cloud folder to make it accessible again. If 
nCrypted Cloud stores your data in compressed zip 
format, protected by industry standard AES-256 
encryption. The universal nature of zip means there are 
plenty of tools—7-Zip (www.7-zip.org), for example—that 
can read, decrypt (with the right password), and extract 
the contents if necessary. The password in question isn’t 
your nCrypted Cloud password; it’s generated using 
nCrypted Cloud’s own key management system.
This consists of two keys: UPK (User Personal Key) 
and URK (User Recovery Key). The UPK is generated 
using your account details, and never leaves your 
client. The URK is a public/private key, stored locally 
in a KeyStore file that’s encrypted by Windows. This is 
transferred to the nCrypted Cloud server, but encrypted 
again before uploading.
URKs are generated for each file, and contain the 
unique password required for decrypting that file, which 
is found in the comment area of the zip file. This allows 
the file to be recovered using the Recovery Key (along 
with your user credentials). You can read a more detailed 
technical overview at https://bit.ly/ncrypted-encryption.

you want to make an unencrypted copy of your target file or folder, 
right-click it in File Explorer, and choose “Copy Unprotected” 
to transfer it to the clipboard, then simply browse to your target 
folder, and press Ctrl-V to copy the unprotected file.

set up trusted shAring
Like all good cloud providers, nCrypted Cloud makes it 
possible to share selected data with trusted users. Better 
still, they don’t need to have their own cloud storage account or 
sign up for nCrypted Cloud. Simply right-click the file or folder 
you wish to share, and choose “Trusted Sharing.” A new window 
appears. Type the email address of each person you want to share 
the folder or file with into the “Recipients” box (click the button to its 
right to use your Outlook address book). You can also add a suitably 
descriptive message to explain what’s happening here, too.
>> If necessary, click “Edit Settings” to fine-tune permissions. By 
default, your audience can only view the file or folder you send them. 
Select “Download” to allow them to download an unencrypted copy 
of the file on to their own computer, and select “Upload” if you’d 
like them to be able to make changes to some or any of the shared 
content (you select what after checking the box), and then upload 
the file back through their browser [image e].
>> You’ll also see a “Watermarked” option—select this, and any 
shared files are watermarked with the recipients’ email and IP 
addresses, discouraging any potential data leaks.
>> For additional security, select “Require Access Code” so your 
recipients need to enter an additional alphanumeric password to 
gain access to the files. Select “Email Code to Recipient” to send 
a separate email containing the access code, or—if you’re ultra-
cautious—communicate it separately.
>> You’ll see the link is set to expire after one week—once this 
date passes, it won’t work. You can change this so the link only 
works once, expires after a day, or choose “Other” to set 
an expiry time by minute, hour, day, or month. Once you’re 
happy, click “Share.”
8
how trusted shAring works
Your recipient then receives one or two emails (the 
second containing the access code, if you opted to 
share it). Clicking “Access Share” takes them to a web page 
where—if necessary—they first need to enter the required 
access code. Once entered, they’re shown the selected 
files or folders in the same Explorer-like interface you use 
when accessing nCrypted Cloud content through your own 
web browser.
>> You’re notified by email whenever anyone accesses the 
file, and if uploading is permitted, you’re also alerted when 
someone either uploads new files or folders to the share, 
or makes changes and uploads edited copies of existing 
files to the nCrypted Cloud collaboration page (they can 
overwrite the original or opt to create a duplicate).
>> To make changes to your share, log in to your 
account at https://login.ncryptedcloud.com, click the 
“Collaboration Management” icon, and go to “My Shares.” 
Click the “Settings” button next to the shared folder, where 
you’ll find options for revoking access, extending the expiry 
date, or tweaking the sharing settings.
9
shAred ACCess
While Trusted Sharing is a good way to quickly share 
selected files and folders with anyone, if you plan to 
take collaboration to the next level, you and your confidants 
need their own Dropbox and nCrypted Cloud accounts (they 
obviously need to link both accounts together, too—go to 
“Preferences > Account” in nCrypted Cloud to do so). 
Once done, you can share a folder over the same cloud 
service without having to remove its encryption.
>> If you’d like anyone you share the folder with to 
have access, right-click the folder in File Explorer, and 
first choose “Enable Shared Access” to set up open 
enrolment—this means anyone with an nCrypted Cloud 
account automatically gains access to the folder when 
you share it with them through their own nCrypted Cloud 
account. Don’t select this if you want to review requests on 
a case-by-case basis.
>> Finally, right-click the folder again, and choose 
the “Dropbox Share” option. Share the file in the usual 
way, and after your recipients accept the invitation in 
Dropbox, they can view the folder’s contents normally in 
the nCrypted Cloud app, or online at the nCrypted Cloud 
web portal. If you skip open enrolment, when they attempt 
to open a file, they’re prompted to either download the 
encrypted (and therefore unreadable) file, or ask for 
access [image F]—you’re prompted by email. Revoke 
access at any time by simply right-clicking the file or folder 
in File Explorer, and choosing “Remove Shared Access” to

protection to individual files or folders? Right-
click the nCrypted Cloud Taskbar Notification area icon, 
and choose “Preferences.” Check the “Show advanced

you next right-click an item and open the nCrypted Cloud 
submenu, you’ll see a new “Sensitivity” menu, offering 
five choices. Select one, and the item is color-coded 
accordingly, from green (Low) through yellow (Medium), 
orange (High), and finally red (Top Secret). Select “none” to 
remove any sensitivity setting.
>> This is fine, but how does it better protect your files? 
Simple: If you mark an item “Top Secret,” you’re prompted 
to enter your nCrypted Cloud account credentials each 
time you access it through the app [image h], providing 
another welcome layer of protection.

>> The second part of this project involves installing an easy-to-
use firewall on your Raspberry Pi, which will block any open ports 
that attackers can exploit. You can also configure the firewall to 
allow access to legitimate programs, as well as block any websites 
you think are unsafe. Provided you have the correct equipment, you 
can have your own secure AP with firewall up and running in under 
20 minutes.

the bAre necessities
The wireless device you use must be compatible with 
Hostapd (more about this shortly). This project is technically 
compatible with all models of Pi, although the Pi needs to be 
both wireless-enabled and have an Ethernet port to connect to 
your router. The Raspberry Pi 3 lends itself very well to this. If at 
all possible, setup should be done using a keyboard and monitor, 
rather than SSH, as once the Pi has created its own AP, you won’t 
be able to connect to it wirelessly. You can, however, connect to it 
through your router’s wireless network, if you know the IP address.
>> If you prefer the compact Pi Zero [image b], make sure you 
have both a USB OTG host cable or a USB to micro-USB OTG 
adapter (available from all Pi accessory suppliers—from Adafruit, 
for example, it’s just $3, www.adafruit.com/product/2910). You 
also need an RJ45 to USB converter to attach to the USB port. 
You can then connect the Pi Zero to your router. In addition to the 
Raspberry Pi itself, you also need a secondary device to check 
You probablY remember the news. In December 2016, it was reported that the infamous Mirai 
worm had infected a substantial number of routers used by customers of UK ISP TalkTalk, stealing 
their Wi-Fi passwords. The worm exploited the default admin passwords that are hardwired into a 
number of machines, and although the focus was on enslaving devices to take part in DOS (Denial 
of Service) attacks, the implications are staggering. Even those handfuls of users who take the 
trouble to change their router’s default passwords seldom bother to use firewalls.
In plain English, this means your router’s settings, and theoretically devices on your home 
wireless network, could be laid bare by attackers. Fortunately, the Raspberry Pi comes to the 
rescue once again, and we’ll show you how. –Nate Drake

that the wireless AP is functioning correctly, as well as 
a network cable to link the Pi to the router. Most modern 
routers have at least one USB port, so you should be able 
to power the Pi from there.
>> For security reasons and to save on resources, 
it’s best to have a dedicated Raspberry Pi for your home 
firewall [image c], rather than one that you might use for 
other additional purposes. If at all possible, plug your Pi 
into a monitor, and work from Terminal directly when going 
through this project, rather than connect via SSH. This 
reduces the chance that your connection will drop at a vital 
stage in the proceedings.
>> As always, it’s best to start with a clean install of the 
latest version of Raspbian on the Pi. Once the install is 
complete, open Terminal, and run the following commands 
to be certain your system is fully up to date:
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get upgrade
>> If you do not have access to a monitor, you can connect 
to the Pi wirelessly through your router’s Wi-Fi network via 
SSH. Connect your Pi to the router via Ethernet cable first. 
If you have a mobile device, the handy app Fing can be used 
to easily identify the IP address of all devices on your local 
network. Fing is available to download free of charge from 
both the iOS App Store and Google Play. 
>> Once you’re satisfied that the AP is working as you 
would like, be sure to disable the wireless function on your 
router, to prevent people from connecting to it instead of 
the Raspberry Pi firewall.

tAlkinG Points
The access point is set up and managed by the handy 
program Hostapd. Step three of our walkthrough over the 
page covers creating a configuration file wherein you specify the 
settings for the Pi’s new wireless network, such as name, password, 
and encryption type used. You can return to this hostapd.conf file at 
any time to change your settings if you wish.
>> While every wireless card can connect you to a Wi-Fi network, 
not all Wi-Fi cards can generate their own wireless networks. 
Fortunately, the Wi-Fi module built into the Raspberry Pi 3 does 
support this feature, which is a good reason to consider using one 
for your firewall. 
>> We’ll also install the devilishly clever program Dnsmasq to 
handle the network infrastructure. It also draws its settings from a 
small configuration file, which you set up in step four. The suggested 
settings have Dnsmasq use Google for its DNS server (8.8.8.8), but 
you can change this to another DNS provider if you wish, such as 
OpenDNS (208.67.222.222). For best performance, you may want to 
list more than one DNS server. To do this, simply add a new line for 
this in the dnsmasq.conf file, for example:
 server=208.67.222.222
 server=208.67.222.220

uncomPlicAted firewAll
Ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) comes bundled with a number 
of Linux distros and, true to its name, is very simple to use. 
It is by no means the only firewall program out there—in fact, there 
are entire distributions of Linux in the wild, such as IPFire (more 
on this next month), which are specifically designed to act as a 
gateway between your computer and the Internet, complete with 
colorful windows. Why, then, use a rather mundane command-line 
application? Aside from the fact that Ufw has withstood the test of 
time, it’s very easy to install and set up. Once enabled, it launches 
automatically. By default, it blocks all incoming connections, and 
allows all outward ones. This can be a nuisance if you and other 
users on your network want to use certain applications, such as 
BitTorrent or Skype, but configuring exceptions to these rules is 
easy. Ufw also has a graphical companion for those who are still not 
entirely comfortable with the command line. See the “Configuring 
your Firewall” boxout on page 65.
>> Ufw also has the ability to block connections to specific IP 
addresses or ranges, so you can prevent network users from 
visiting certain websites (see “Domain Denial,” above-right).
>> Although Ufw can be used to block individual websites, any 
web pages that do load display banner ads and pop-ups. By far 
the easiest way to deal with these irritations is for you and other 
users on your network to install browser extensions, such as 
Ublock Origin and Ghostery, to prevent both ads and tracking 
cookies. Mobile users can also benefit from the official 
Adblock Browser.
>> If this isn’t feasible, you can remove the Raspberry 
Pi’s default DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
server, and configure Dnsmasq in its place to automatically 
redirect known ad servers to an internal IP address. By 
default, this creates ugly blank spaces in the middle of 
your web pages, but you can solve this by also installing 
the handy app Pixelserv. Pixelserv’s sole purpose in life is 
to support ad-blocking via serving a transparent 1x1-pixel 
GIF image in place of ads. This makes your ad-blocking a 
much tidier experience.
>> If you’re interested in adding an ad-blocking feature 
to the Raspberry Pi, a tutorial is available on the Adafruit 
website: https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-as-an-
ad-blocking-access-point. 
Its full name, Uncomplicated Firewall, might sound modest, 
but Ufw is a powerful firewall, and can be used to block access 
to certain websites. Although, technically, you can also do 
this with Dnsmasq, this would be a form of “DNS hijacking,” 
which is a rather dastardly procedure, usually carried out 
by scammers.
The advantage of using Ufw is that it blocks domains 
by IP address. This means you have to write down only 
one rule per address, rather than remember the various 
domains and subdomains used by sites. Imagine trying to 
block every variant of Facebook.com, for instance: fb.com,  
m.facebook.com, the list goes on.
It stands to reason, then, that in order to block websites by 
IP address, you need that information. Open Terminal on your 
Pi, or connect via SSH, and use the  host  command to view an 
objectionable page’s IP address. For instance:
 host strawberryfunk.com
This outputs the IP address of the site in question. Next, 
use  ufw deny  to block this domain. For example:
 sudo ufw deny out from any to 205.178.189.29
You can check that the domain has successfully been 
blocked by using  ping . For example:
 ping -c 1 strawberryfunk.com
If you have set up Ufw correctly, ping reports that the 
domain is unreachable. 
Ufw can also block outgoing connections to certain ports. 
For instance, if you want to reduce the chance of your Pi being 
used to send spam messages, you can disable Port 25 with 
the following:
 sudo ufw deny out 25

 ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
 wpa=2
 wpa_key_mgmt=WPa-Psk
 wpa_passphrase=raspberry231
 wpa_pairwise=tkiP
 rsn_pairwise=CCMP
Change the SSID, passphrase, and 
network encryption as you see fit. 
Next run:
 sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
Find the line starting “#DAEMON_
CONF=“”.” Remove the # at the start of 
the line and change it to:
 DaeMoN_CoNF=”/etc/hostapd/ 
 hostapd.conf”
6. set up fIrewall 
Run the following commands, one after 
the other:
 sudo update-rc.d hostapd enable
 sudo update-rc.d dnsmasq enable
Reboot the Pi, and reopen Terminal. To 
install and then enable the firewall, run 
the following:
 sudo apt-get install ufw gufw
 sudo ufw enable

Once enabled, Ufw automatically launches on startup, 
blocking all incoming connections, and allowing all outgoing 
ones. This might not be the ideal setup for you, particularly 
if you like to connect to your Pi via SSH or VNC. To configure 
Ufw, use Terminal on your Pi. Ufw recognizes most services 
like SSH, so in most cases you can enable access using  
 ufw allow . For instance:
 sudo ufw allow ssh
To see a full list of services you can enable in this way, 
simply run the following command:
 nano /etc/services
If your service isn’t listed, you can simply open the port it 
uses. For instance, RealVNC, which can be used to connect 
remotely to the Pi’s desktop, runs on Port 5800. To have Ufw 
open it, run:
 sudo ufw allow 5800
To allow connections only from a specific IP address, use 
 from . For instance:
 sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.12
For a complete readout of the firewall settings in Ubuntu, 
use the following:
 sudo ufw status verbose
To make life even easier for you, Ufw has a graphical 
companion, Gufw. To open it, run:
 sudo gufw
There’s a handy rocker switch, as well as a list of open and 
blocked ports. Click the “+” button to add additional rules.

buildinG bridGes
This project focuses on bridging the connection between 
your Pi’s wireless interface and the Ethernet interface. This 
allows your access point to remain connected to the Internet. If you 
need to double-check the names of your interfaces, you can run 
the command  ifconfig  at any time. By default, the names of these 
interfaces should be “wlan0” and “eth0” respectively.
>> If you’re unable to plug the Pi into a router, theoretically you 
could add another wireless interface, such as the official Raspberry 
Pi Wi-Fi module, and use it to access your router’s wireless 
network. However, this is less secure, and reduces your connection 
speed. If your router is somewhere hard to reach (or actually out of 
range), consider using a “homeplug” style device, which uses the 
power lines in your home or office for network connections.
>> Do not despair if the access point or the firewall do not work the 
first time you go through the steps. Fortunately, the Pi’s network 
settings are very flexible, so you can usually go back over the steps 
again without having to reinstall Raspbian.
>> If you’re using a Wi-Fi driver besides that built into the Pi 3 
or the official Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi adapter, you may have to change 
the “driver=” value in hostapd.conf. For information, visit http://
linuxwireless.org/en/users/Documentation/hostapd. 
>> You can disable the Ufw firewall permanently and delete all 
rules with the following command:
 sudo ufw reset
>> If required, you can also restore the settings you previously 
backed up with Dnsmasq, by reversing the original command:
 sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig /etc/dnsmasq.conf
>> If you choose to block specific ports or services (see the 
“Domain Denial” boxout on page 63), bear in mind that IT-literate 
users on your network could bypass this via a VPN. You can, of 
course, use Ufw to block the ports commonly used by VPNs, such 
as 1154, or block all outgoing traffic, and then enable it for specific 
applications and services. Some applications randomize the ports 
used, making it difficult to lock down specific protocols, such as 
BitTorrent. You might consider disabling UDP (User Datagram 
Protocol) if you want to prevent streaming of most music and 
video sites. 
>> If you choose to use a browser extension or Pixelserv to block 
ads, certain sites may display incorrectly or fail to load altogether. 
Ad-blocking extensions can usually be disabled temporarily by 
clicking on their icon in your browser’s menu bar. 
For security reasons, it would be wise to use a dedicated Pi 
exclusively as an access point, and avoid placing any personal data 
on it. For extra safety, be sure to use a long, robust password—the 
one in the tutorial is only by way of example.
>> For the uber-cautious, consider creating a hidden Wi-Fi 
network for the Pi [image d]. Edit the Hostapd configuration by 
opening a Terminal and typing:
 /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
Change 
“ignore_broadcast_ssid=0” 
to 
“ignore_
broadcast_ssid=1.” From now on, all devices will have to 
enter the name of the network as well as the password 
in order to connect. Consider setting a new name when 
editing the file to be extra secure. 
>> If you have devices using a cabled connection, such as 
a home server, you can continue connecting these directly 
to your router for Internet access, but bear in mind that 
they won’t be visible on the Pi’s wireless network. This 
works both ways, however—the Pi will not interfere with 
their operations at all. 
>> Finally, bear in mind that your router may also use a 
firewall. If you’re comfortable with configuring your router, 
you can choose to open and close ports to match Ufw’s 
settings. Alternatively, you can disable the router’s firewall 
altogether, and let the Pi manage everything.

The Last Password 
You’ll Ever Need
1 
Create aCCount and enable two-step verifiCation
Visit https://bitwarden.com and select “Create an account.” 
The master password that you enter here will be the only way 
to access your encrypted logins in the future, so make sure it’s 
memorable, and add a hint that only makes sense to you. Once 
you’ve finished, log in.
>> It’s a good idea to initiate two-factor authentication so that 
even if your master password is compromised, your logins can’t 
be decrypted without verification from your smartphone. Click 
“Settings > Two-step login.” Enter your master password again, 
then download the appropriate mobile app (Authy for iOS or Android, 
or Microsoft Authenticator for Windows devices), and follow the on-
screen instructions to create an authentication account. Use the 
smartphone app to scan the QR code on your Bitwarden account 
page [image a] to connect the two accounts. Now, to log into 
Bitwarden, you’ll need not only your master password, but also a 
seven-digit security token generated by the mobile app every 20 
seconds. Bitwarden provides you with a backup code in case you 
lose your phone; keep this in a safe place.
We all knoW We shouldn’t re-use passWords, but with so many websites requiring user 
accounts, creating a different, secure, memorable login for each is all but impossible. That’s before 
you consider how you’re going to change them regularly (a policy enforced by some companies). 
This leads to an problem: If someone can crack the password for one of your accounts, it can 
open the door to many others. That’s where password managers come in, storing all your account 
details in a central location, and automatically completing login screens so you don’t have to 
remember them yourself (or jot them down on sticky notes). The password vault is secured by a 
single master password, which is the only one you need to commit to memory.
Bitwarden is a free, open-source password manager that stores your account details in 
the cloud, enabling you to access them from any Internet-enabled device. Bitwarden encrypts 
everything using AES 256-bit encryption and salted hashing, so the data on its servers is no use 
without your master password—and your smartphone, if you enable two-factor authentication. 
Because Bitwarden is cloud-based, it can’t be used to secure passwords for Wi-Fi access points, 
Windows user accounts, or other offline services, but for web accounts, it’s excellent. –Cat Ellis

store your logins
Now you’re ready to start saving your usernames 
and passwords. You probably have dozens of 
logins, so it’s useful to keep them organized by type; click 
“My vault > New folder,” and make some directories for 
different account types (social media, email, shopping, 
forums, and so on). Now click “Add a login,” and fill in 
the form provided [image b]. Bitwarden shows you the 
strength of your password as you type it. Click the eye icon 
to make sure you’ve typed the password correctly, or click 
the refresh icon to generate a new, stronger one. There’s 
also an area to store notes, which are encrypted along with 
the username and password.
>> Add the rest of your logins in the same way. Now, 
whenever you visit one of those sites while logged into 
Bitwarden, the username and password fields are 
completed for you automatically.

multiple accounts, you can connect them to avoid

duplicating the effort of entering them. Set one up in your vault, 
then click “Settings > Domain rules.” Bitwarden comes with a list 
of related sites that are likely to use the same login details—such 
as Google and YouTube—which can be toggled on and off [image C]. 
To add your own equivalents, scroll right down to the bottom of the 
list, and click “Add new.” Enter the domains you want to connect, 
separated by commas, then click “Submit.” Note that you can only 
use “base” domains—not subdomains. 
4 
import and export logins
If you’re moving to Bitwarden from a different password 
manager, you don’t have to re-enter all your logins manually. 
Most password managers offer the ability to export your archived 
logins in CSV (comma-separated value) format. To add them to 
Bitwarden, select “Tools > Import” from your dashboard, then 
locate the file, and click “Import.” If, for whatever reason, you 
decide Bitwarden isn’t the tool for you, you can also export logins 
in the same way.
5 
get the browser extension
The Bitwarden browser extensions are a convenient way to 
manage passwords on the sites you visit, without visiting 
https://bitwarden.com to start a new browsing session. There 
are currently plugins available for Firefox, Chrome, and Opera—
just search for “bitwarden” in the appropriate store, install it, 
and log in with your username and master password (plus a 
C
verification code from your phone if you’ve enabled two-
factor authentication). Most of the features will be familiar 
from https://bitwarden.com, but the password generator 
[image d] is a very handy extra tool that helps you make 
secure logins for sites that demand specific character 
counts or types. Click “Tools > Password generator,” 
and use the checkboxes to choose whether the password 
should be upper case, lower case, or a mixture of both, and 
whether it should contain numbers or special characters 
(and how many).
6 
try bitwarden’s mobile app
Bitwarden also has a mobile app for iOS and 
Android. Once it’s installed on your smartphone, 
log in using your username, password, and verification 
code. Again, most of the features will be familiar, but there 
are some interesting extras. Tap “Settings” and you’ll find 
additional security options, including the ability to log in 
with a fingerprint or PIN, and how long your session should 
remain active before it’s locked and you have to re-enter 
your master password. 
>> To visit a site and log in, tap “Vault,” then tap the site’s 
URL, and it opens in your default browser. Bitwarden’s 
developer is currently working on an improved auto-fill 
feature, but for the time being, you have to copy and paste 
passwords from Bitwarden into other apps. 
There are lots of other password 
managers. Some, including KeePass, 
store your encrypted logins locally. This 
means you retain complete control of your 
logins, and you can access them offline, 
but setting up synching is complicated 
(the options are explained at http://
keepass.info/help/v2/sync.html), 
and 
they’re less convenient if you use multiple 
devices. Others, such as LastPass and 
Bitwarden, store your logins on remote 
servers after encrypting them. This is 
more convenient for multiple devices, but 
means you have to trust that the servers 
will remain up, and won’t have their 
security compromised. In 2015, LastPass 
reported that user data had been 
stolen from its servers, including email 
addresses, password reminders, and 
authentication hashes. The hashes were 
sufficiently encrypted to prevent anyone 
accessing user accounts, but all users 
had to reset their master passwords 
to be safe. It’s up to you to decide what 
your biggest priority is—however, since 
Bitwarden has far fewer users than 
LastPass, it’s less likely to be a target.

Polygonal Portraits

On the grid
First of all, let’s set up the document grid. This will make it easier 
to keep our triangles together. Pull down the “Edit” menu, and 
select “Preferences > Grids, Guides, and Slices” [image A]. Type 
in a figure for your grid spacing. For our picture, taken with a 16MP 
DSLR, we went for a gridline every 50 pixels, with subdivisions 
every 10. We also selected an off-white color and changed the grid 
into a pattern of dots, so the underlying image showed through 
better. Use “View > Show > Grid” if you can’t see the grid. When 
it comes to drawing the triangles, this grid will make it easier to 
get them even, with their sides and points neatly lined up. Turn on 
grid-snapping (“View > Snap”) to make it even easier, because your 
pointer will stick to the grid lines—we particularly recommend this, 
as we started out with good intentions, but soon drifted away from 
the grid while creating our triangle matrix. Later, we wished we’d 
had the self control to stay on the grid—you’ll get a much better end 
result as a result of sticking to it.

Next, we’re going to create an Action. Actions are like the

sequences of commands that are played back on request. 
Photoshop’s Actions can record mouse and menu events, as well 
as keypresses, and hotkeys can be assigned to play back an Action 
Be warned: This is time-consuming. If you’re not prepared to draw loads of little triangles, perhaps 
you should skip past. However, if that kind of work with Photoshop’s Polygonal Lasso tool leaves you 
breathless with anticipation, this low-poly portrait is a great way to create a striking representation 
of a friend or loved one to hang on your wall or something. We just tell you how to make it, not what 
to do with it afterward.
You will, as ever, need a suitable source image to work with. We’ve chosen a full-face portrait 
of a beautiful young model, and halfway through the process wished we’d picked a different photo. 
Something with a little more background, not so tightly framed, would be faster to work with, due 
to there being less area to cover with triangles. 
Whatever you choose, putting the time and effort into making the portrait will give you a fantastic 
final result, and tighten up some core Photoshop skills, such as pointer accuracy and use of a 
document grid, along the way. –Ian EvEndEn

Polygonal Lasso, trigger your action, repeat. Every triangle ends 
up on a different layer [image c], so if you get one wrong or want 
to tweak the effect later, you can. Save frequently as a PSD file, to 
preserve the layer structure, and remember you can double-click 
to complete a triangle once you’ve drawn two sides. Start at the 
edge with larger triangles, making them smaller as you pass over 
areas of more detail, such as the eyes. Hit Caps Lock to turn your 
pointer into a crosshair for more accuracy, and try to encompass 
areas of similar color within your triangles, as the Average filter 
isn’t kind to contrasting skintones, rendering them muddy brown.

Once you’ve finished all the triangles, you end up with a 
rather large file. Ours was 100MB and had 420 layers. As 
you can see from image d, which has the Background layer hidden, 
we’ve ended up with slight gaps between our triangles, a result of 
not having enough discipline when snapping to the grid. It’s still 
an interesting result, though, and by merging the triangle layers 
(Shift-select them all, then go to “Layer > Merge”), you can play 
with the blending of the triangles with the background.

Finishing tOuches
We found that using the “Darken” blend mode (find 
it in the drop-down menu on the Layers palette) led 
to a striking blend of the two image styles, while “Divide” 
inverted many of the colors, and made it look like our 
model was caught in a nuclear fireball. Experiment with 
the blend modes, darkening the upper layer using Hue 
and Saturation’s “Lightness” slider (Ctrl-U or “Image > 
Adjustments > Hue/Saturation”), or perhaps add extra 
triangles near the edges, to give the impression your 
subject is flying apart in a storm of polygons. Whatever you 
choose to do, remember to save your work often, and keep 
a layered PSD file of it for later tinkering [image e].

to select using geometric

which comes in rectangular 
and elliptical flavors, but sadly 
not as a triangle. The Lasso 
also has a magnetic variant, 
which attempts to stick to 
contrasting edges in your 
image, so you could, in theory, 
trace it around the edge of a 
house without having to be 
too precise. In practical use, 
however, it rarely ends up with 
the kind of precise selection 
you’re looking for.

Breathing Fresh 
Life into Old Gear
We are asked to piece together 
machines 
all 
the 
time 
here 
on 
Maximum PC. These one-off projects 
are generally short-lived, and are 
designed to solve a particular problem 
or help elsewhere: a quick boost to a 
rendering farm, say, or to see whether 
a new graphics card or CPU really 
improves performance in a particular 
application. We also get more specific 
requests, such as a recent one to build 
a system for games coding. The caveat 
on this one was for a machine that they 
would get to keep—something we don’t 
normally do because the components 
generally need to be returned to our 
hardware hoard for future builds. 
However, we were feeling benevolent, 
so set out to put some of the older gear 
to good use.
When it comes to coding, there aren’t 
many specialist requirements above 
and beyond what you would want from a 
modern machine. A little more memory 
than the bare minimum helps, as does 
a speedy multi-core processor for 
compiling, and fast drives can make a 
difference when throwing around high-
resolution assets. But, in general, any 
PC can turn its hand to the task. Still, 
it helps to know what the machine will 
be used for when picking components.

Beggars Can Be Choosers 
This Build Was a deparTure from the norm, in that it wasn’t a 
case of starting with a shopping list, then tracking down an ideal 
collection of hardware from which to build a glorious system. 
Instead, it was about looking at what was in the storeroom, what 
wasn’t likely to be recalled, and what would work together to 
form a machine that was fit for purpose. So, we trawled through 
our spreadsheets and dusty cupboards for parts that were viable, 
if not exactly cutting-edge. 
Our first port of call was the AMD FX-8370E, which is a 
reasonable enough processor, if not quite competitive with Intel’s 
offerings. It’s an “eight-core” chip that relishes multi-threaded 
environments, though it struggles at less parallel work. The 
price doesn’t make a lot of sense either, which is why it’s been 
languishing in our chip drawer, waiting for a moment to shine. 
We’ve slotted this into the MSI 970 Gaming, which is a thrill-free, 
but competent, board. For graphics, the Asus Strix 960 2GB is 
beginning to show its age, but it handles older games without a 
problem. The rest of the spec is fairly straightforward, with the 
exception of storage—where we’d normally use a spinning drive 
alongside a speedy boot SSD, we’ve employed another SSD for 
that task. This will help keep access speeds up, while providing 
plenty of space at the same time. It’s a pricey solution, but it 
makes sense to focus the potential budget where it counts.
We admiT To Being oBsessed with cooling, and adding 
more fans to a case is pretty much the first thing we 
do with any build. Easing more fans into the BitFenix 
Shadow was straightforward, as there’s room for a pair 
of 120mm fans behind the front panel. We reached for a 
couple of the Spectre Xtremes, and screwed them into 
place after popping off the panel. We were squeezed 
for PWM fan headers on the MSI 970 Gaming, but didn’t 
want the fans running at full speed all the time, as that 
would be unnecessary. This is why we attached the fans 
to the motherboard through a low-noise adapter (LNA), 
which reduces their running speed, so helps keep noise 
levels down. You can pick up a triple-pack of these from 
Be Quiet! for about $5, which is a decent investment.
The BiTFenix shadoW Case isn’t exactly cutting-edge, 
but it’s not a relic either, which is why we were surprised 
to discover that there’s no easy way to mount SSDs in 
its monolithic form. There are plenty of drive bays, but 
the holes for the 3.5-inch bays don’t line up with the 
mounting holes on our SSDs, and the tool-free brackets 
on the 5.25-inch bays don’t fit either. Our solution was to 
screw the drives into place instead. Unfortunately, this 
was only possible in the 5.25-inch drive bays, but there’s 
the obvious problem that we couldn’t secure the drives 
in place from both sides, as we couldn’t find a mounting 
bracket. We’re not too concerned about the drives only 
being screwed in on one side, though, because SSDs 
are light, and won’t move under their own weight.

keeping your CaBling ouT of the way is a good idea in any 
build, because it not only keeps the build looking tidy, but it also 
helps with airflow. Getting the ATX power cables to play ball can 
often be a pain, though, so you need to plan ahead with regard 
to how you’re going to achieve this. Here we routed the EPS12V 
cable behind the motherboard, before actually installing 
the motherboard, so that it was completely out of the way. The 
main ATX power cable was a little easier to route, thanks to 
the section behind the drive bays that is designed specifically 
to help on this front.
in a perFeCT World, we’d kit out this machine with a card 
befitting premium games development: Something along 
the lines of a GeForce GTX 1080 or even a Titan X would be 
lovely. However, we can’t afford to give such things away 
as though they’re candy, so it was a case of installing what 
we had spare. The Asus Strix 960 is a solid card that can 
handle most games at 1080p with the settings dialed back 
a little. It’s fair to say that upgrading this would offer up the 
biggest boost to frame rates, though, and there’s plenty of 
room to support such a purchase. The EVGA 600B power 
supply supports dual eight-pin connectors as well, so no 
worries on that front.

graphiCs on a BudgeT
The TriCk WiTh non-modular power supplies is knowing 
what to do with unused cables—hide them away, truss them 
up into a central column, or construct a coil out of them. 
Here we went for the final option, as there wasn’t room 
to hide them behind the motherboard tray, and a central 
column wasn’t needed. While a little unsightly, tying up the 
unused connectors with cable ties means they’re kept out 
of the way in terms of airflow, but are available if you add 
additional hardware. Don’t overdo the cable ties, though, as 
freeing a cable if you need it shouldn’t be a chore. 
We’re so used To insTalling all-in-one water coolers in our 
builds, that it was something of a shock going back to a straight 
air cooler. It worked well in practice, though—once we’d actually 
got it installed. We did need to install a holding bracket on the 
motherboard before we could use it, which we only realized 
after screwing the motherboard in place—learn from our 
mistake, and install the bracket first. Once done, however, the 
cooler clips into place relatively easily, even if space is a little 
tight. Installing the cooler before dropping the motherboard 
into place would have been a wiser move.

These toolless drive bays are 
fine for traditional spinning 
and optical drives, but the 
mounting pins don’t line up with 
ssds. There’s plenty of space if 
you do want to add more drives, 
though, and the fans behind the 
front door will help to keep them 
cool if you do.
2
The BitFenix shadow case 
we’ve used doesn’t have a 
side window panel, so while this 
isn’t the tidiest build we’ve ever 
done, it’s good enough in terms of 
airflow, and because no one can 
see inside, it doesn’t need to look 
any better than this.
3
The case comes with a single 
fan installed at the rear, 
which we’ve left in place to help 
with the overall airflow—
important when dealing with a 
traditional Cpu air cooler.
We’ll Be honesT, this isn’t a machine that is  
going to set the world alight in terms of raw 
performance. When you’re piecing together a 
system using older parts, though, it’s never 
really going to be anything else. You could 
argue, quite fairly, that a system built with 
development in mind should use the latest, 
greatest hardware. After all, when time is 
precious, scrimping on parts at the build stage 
will ultimately cost you in the long run. That 
would be true in a professional capacity, but 
this was actually built with an intern in mind, 
and because it uses a lot of older, unused 
parts, it’s essentially free.
The build itself was fairly straightforward, 
with only the SSD mounting causing any 
serious head-scratching. The fact that those 
holes don’t line up at all had us wondering 
whether we were doing something seriously 
wrong, but we simply couldn’t resolve what 
was happening here. It could be that we were 
missing some holding brackets, which is a risk 
you take when you’re using older hardware 
that may not be complete. 
When it comes to performance, the 
machine may struggle to impress when 
compared to our default zero-point, but it’s 
really not that bad a machine in normal day-
to-day use. Those gaming frame rates are 
generally smooth, and with a few judicious 
tweaks here and there, you should be able to 
enjoy games for a few years yet. The Deus Ex 
Mankind Divided score is low, but that game 
does appear to thrash even top-end hardware 
as well—we would have hoped that some 
optimizations would have materialized by now, 
but nothing yet.
By the time you read this, AMD Ryzen will 
be out in the wild, and a quick look at the 
Cinebench score here shows that it couldn’t 
have come soon enough. To be brutally 
honest, AMD’s Piledriver is miserable when 
compared to Intel’s offerings—even a Core i3 
will give this chip a run for its money. At the 
lower end of the pricing spectrum, this can 
be forgiven, but at this price, we expect much 
more. It does have the raw core count when 
it comes to compiling and handling multiple 
threads, though, so isn’t quite as bad as this 
benchmark would suggest. 
We would recommend upgrading the 
graphics card, depending on what sort of 
game development the user intends doing 
with it, but this is a reasonable enough starting 
point. Apart from that, the core specification 
should last a couple of years, and with that 
large meaty data SSD, there should be plenty 
of space for textures, videos, models, and 
anything else needed. A bit more memory 
wouldn’t go amiss, but again, as a starting 
point, this isn’t too bad. The PSU should last a 
few upgrades as well.

Ryzen has been in development for six 
long, arduous years, hand-crafted by 
the grand master architect himself, Jim 
Keller, and perfected by AMD’s crack team 
of engineers. And since 2011, as AMD has 
had to weather Intel’s aggressive, yet 
incrementally dull, Core-series storm, 
Ryzen has endured, flourished even, 
waiting to be unleashed. It’s hard to deny 
how much hype Zen has generated, with 
many hoping and praying that it would 
shake up the market, and unseat Intel 
from its perch of pride. So, has it met our 
expectations? And is it worthy of the hype?
The AMD Ryzen 7 1800X is an eight-core, 
16-thread, 14nm behemoth of a processor. 
Each core sports 64KB of L1 cache, followed 
by 512KB of L2 cache, and 8MB of L3 cache 
shared between each set of four cores, 
giving each R7 series chip a combined total 
of 16MB of L3. That last part is important: 
Instead of allocating 2MB to each core, the 
cache is shared across each set of four, 
so the processor can allocate memory to 
each core depending on how much it needs, 
without having to store that additional data 
externally in the memory itself. 
So, what’s the difference between all the 
7-series chips? After all, each comes fully 
unlocked, and each comes packing eight 
cores, and 16 threads. It mostly comes 
down to two things: clock speeds and TDP. 
At the very bottom of the ladder (if you can 
even call it that) is the Ryzen 7 1700, with 
a clock speed of 3GHz at stock, boosting to 
3.7GHz, given the right cooling, and a 65W 
TDP. Next is the 1700X, with a 3.4/3.8GHz 
clock speed, and a 95W TDP. And, lastly, the 
1800X, still touting that 95W TDP, but with a 
base clock of 3.6GHz, turboing up to 4.0GHz 
The Red Wedding
AMD Ryzen 7 1800X
when the situation demands. In short, 
you pay for better binned chips, but with a 
higher TDP. If overclocking isn’t your jam, 
the 1700X is perfect; if you’re after a content 
creator on a budget, the 1700 is ideal; and if 
you want the absolute maximum, you’ll go 
for this little beauty, the 1800X.
Making sense
On top of the TDP and clock speed variance, 
the X-series processors come with AMD’s 
latest SenseMi software suite, including 
one neat little inclusion in the form of XFR, 
or extended frequency range. Think of it as 
GPU boost for processors. Thanks to Ryzen 
incorporating over 1,000 different sensors 
into each chip, it can detect how much 
voltage is being directed to each area, and 
how well the chip is being cooled, then 
overclocks individual cores as necessary, 
boosting 
frequencies 
by 
50–100MHz, 
depending on the application, cooling 
capacity, and utilization. Although not 
hugely impressive considering how little 
overclocking potential the R7 series has, 
it bodes well for AMD’s future chip design.
Now the bit you’ve been waiting for: 
performance. For the price, it’s incredible. 
Watching those 16 threads blazing away in 
Cinebench was a joy to behold. It absolutely 
smashed what we expected, scoring an 
astounding 1,612 in Cinebench R15, with 
single-core performance at an impressive 
160 points—only 20 behind Intel’s top-
end 
Skylake 
chips. 
Other

benchmarks 
continued 
to 
impress, 
smashing figures by minutes in some 
cases. Power wattage was low for an eight-

are still only four-core parts. Gaming was 
impressive, too: Across all our 1440p tests, 
we only saw frame rates differ by 1–2fps at 
most from the Intel counterparts.
That said, this chip is nothing if not 
unusual. Its aggressive price point, insane 
core count, and stunning performance 
only account for one part of its disruptive 
nature. Overclocking is also a mixed bag, 
with most 1800Xs only capable of maxing 
between 4.0 and 4.1GHz on all eight cores. 
But the real kicker is how the 1800X 
handles temperatures. With a 280mm 
AIO locked into place, we recorded idle 
temps at 50–60 C, which is ridiculously 
hot. We conferred with colleagues and 
other industry journalists, but they were 
seeing the same. However, weirdly, 
under 100 percent load across all eight 
cores, the 1800X topped out at 73 C, and 
then just held it there.
When all’s said and done, the Ryzen 7 
1800X is phenomenal. For the money, its 
performance dwarfs the competition, 
and shines a light on the profit margins 
Intel has been leveraging over the last 
few years. Disruptive? Definitely. Is AMD 
on top again? Time will tell. –zak stoRey

With any neW intel processor comes a 
new and improved chipset, while every 
other generation brings a new socket 
type, too. This pushes people into a newer 
platform, while giving Intel the opportunity 
to reinforce the chipset with better 
connectivity options. And, of course, it 
gives AIB manufacturers the opportunity to 
reiterate their own motherboard designs. 
Jump ship to the red side of the fence, 
however, and the role has generally been 
reversed. AMD has always prided itself 
on maintaining a resolute socket type, 
requiring only a BIOS update to enable 
its latest performance powerhouses to 
operate with impunity. Which has meant 
that both chipset updates and connectivity 
have suffered. 
With the launch of Ryzen and the AM4 
socket, on the other hand, it seems this 
state of affairs may be changing in the 
rouge ecosystem. Taking a quick glance 
at AMD’s X370 chipset and comparing it 
to Intel’s Z270, you’d be justified in feeling 
slightly underwhelmed. By default, Intel’s 
Z270 chipset supports 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 
six SATA 6Gb/s, 10 USB 3.0 ports, 14 USB 
2.0 ports, and Intel Gigabit Ethernet. In 
contrast, AMD’s X370 supports eight PCIe 
2.0 lanes, four SATA 6Gb/s, two USB 3.1 
Type C ports, six USB 3.0 ports, six USB 
2.0 ports, and, once again, Intel Gigabit

Ethernet. However, that’s far from the full 
story. It’s only when you take a look at what 
Ryzen (the processor) directly supports 
that you get a better understanding of how 
this platform will work going forward. By 
default, all of Ryzen’s 7 series will support 
four USB 3.0 ports, four USB 2.0 ports, 16 
Gen 3.0 dedicated graphics PCIe lanes 
(similar to its Intel Kaby counterparts), 
an additional four PCIe 3.0 lanes for 
“general use” (read: “NVMe SSD”), and 
an additional four PCIe 3.0 lanes for 
chipset communication. Which brings it 
exceedingly close to its Kaby competition, 
although without support for more than a 
single M.2 PCIe SSD.
Now let’s look at the motherboard 
in question. Asus’s Crosshair VI Hero is 
the first X370 mobo we’ve had in the labs 
for testing, and it’s everything we want 
in a board. With support for DDR4 up to 
3,200MHz, two 16 PCIe 3.0 slots, eight SATA 
6Gb/s ports, a single M.2 PCIe x4 port, a 
plethora of fan headers, and a rear I/O that 
makes most Z270 boards look like a meal 
at your local Denny’s, it’s insanely good 
value for money. There’s no integrated 
graphics support here, but to be quite 
frank, it’s simply not needed with any of 
the three processors. The VRM solution is 
substantial, and having an eight-pin EPS 
power, plus an additional four-pin 12V CPU 
power, has allowed this board to clock up to 
5.2GHz with some world-record-breaking 
chips. So, overclocking should be covered, 
if you luck out in the silicon lottery.
The biggest benefit the Hero has over its 
competition, though, is down to the socket 
itself. Namely, cooler support. AM4 has, 
rather annoyingly, come with an ever-so-
slightly different mounting solution from 
its AM3+ predecessor’s design. However, 
the Hero has mounting holes for both AM3+ 
and AM4 coolers. 
Although we can’t give any word on 
comparative performance just yet (at the 
time of writing, we’re only two days away 
from our print deadline), overall it seems 
solid in contrast to the Intel alternatives, 
and we’re happy to give it our seal of 
approval for anyone looking to get into the 
new AM4 platform. –Zak storey

After testing crAzy multi-GPU setups 
for the past few issues, it was nice to kick 
back with a sleek, straightforward system. 
High-end machines are fun to play with, 
but their power levels (and price tags) 
are overkill for the majority of users, and 
SLI is becoming increasingly frustrating 
to deal with. This month, we’re looking at 
the Lenovo Y900 RE, a mid-tower desktop 
featuring 
top-end 
(but 
reasonable) 
components, accompanied by a 27-inch 
Lenovo Y27g RE curved monitor. 
The Y900 RE itself is a respectable 
system aimed mostly at gamers. The Intel 
Core i7-6700K CPU is clocked at 4.0GHz, 
but a “one-key turbo” button can push it up 
to 4.5GHz. That’s enough to not bottleneck 
the GPU, and should be able to handle 
streaming or light video editing—though 
it would have been nice to see an updated 
Kaby Lake chip in there instead of last 
generation’s i7-6700K. The difference isn’t 
huge, but the i7-7700K would have given 
the system a bit more juice for basically the 
same price. 
A bigger issue is the installed RAM—a 
single stick of 16GB DDR4-2133. To us, that’s 
the weakest link of all the components, 
contributing to benchmark scores lower 
than our zero-point in all non-gaming 
tests: 790 in Cinebench 15, 18.68 in Tech 
ARP’s x264, and 5,635 in PCMark 8 Creative 
(without CPU overclocking). Storage is 
handled by a 256GB PCIe SSD accompanied 
by a 2TB 7,200 rpm HDD, the former scoring 
42.26 and 165.1 in CrystalDiskMark64 4K 
read and write respectively—zippy, but 
again falling short of our zero-point. For 
RGB as far as the eye can see
Lenovo Y900 RE
gaming needs, the Y900 RE features a 
more-than-capable 
Nvidia 
GTX 
1080, 
which handily gave us solid frame rates in 
all of our gaming benchmarks. The system 
pulled an average of 88fps across Rise of 
the Tomb Raider’s three-part benchmark 
at 1080p max settings, scoring 131fps at  
the mountain peak, 71fps in Syria, and  
61fps in the geothermal valley. Far Cry 
Primal and The Division also performed 
well, at 95fps and 92fps respectively—
again at 1080p max settings. 
Frame rates hovering in the 90–120 
range fit perfectly with the bundled Y27g 
RE monitor, a 27-inch curved screen, with 
1920x1080 resolution, and 144Hz refresh 
rate. The screen itself looks great, offering 
very good brightness and color, but might 
seem overpriced ($650) to some for only 
offering 1080p resolution. However, much 
of that price is due to the inclusion of 
Nvidia’s G-Sync technology for variable 
refresh rates, which nicely eliminates 
screen tearing, even at those higher frame 
rates. Aside from being only 1080p, the 
biggest bummer about the Y27g is a lack 
of speakers. Monitor audio often isn’t 
spectacular, but it’s still a nice inclusion on 
a modern piece of equipment—especially 
at this price point.
Ride the Rainbow
The RE stands for Razer Edition, because 
the Y900 RE comes bundled with a Razer 
Mamba Tournament Edition mouse and 
Blackwidow Chroma keyboard, and sports 
Razer branding and Chroma lighting 
integration. Both peripherals are great 
pieces of hardware—Razer’s Deathadder 
Elite is one of our favorite gaming mice, 
and the Mamba offers everything that does, 
plus tilt buttons on the mouse wheel, as well 
as two extra buttons for DPI adjustment. 
Similarly, 
the 
Blackwidow 
Chroma 
features everything you want in a gaming 
keyboard: clicky mechanical switches, USB 
pass-through, mic/headphone jack, and a 
five-key macro column. 
The Y900 RE comes in a sleek case 
that matches the Razer aesthetic. It feels 
relatively sturdy, made mostly of metal 
and plastic, and features a neat side panel 
that pops out when you press a spot on top. 
The main difference between the RE and 
the plain, non-Razer-branded Y900 (aside 
from the bundled Mamba and Blackwidow) 
is Chroma integration for the Y-shaped 
accent lighting. With Chroma support, 
the case lights can sync (or not) with the 
aforementioned mouse and keyboard, 
offering a bright array of colors and 
patterns. However, an equally spec’d plain 
Y900 is priced at $450 less than the Razer 
Edition, so it’s up to you to decide whether 
a mouse, keyboard, and light show is worth 
the extra cash. –Bo Moore

Best scores are in bold. Our test bench consists of an Intel Core i7-7700K, Asus Maximus IX Hero, 
and 16GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR4-2400.
Is the market for m.2 SSDs with support 
for the NVMe control protocol already a 
bit stagnant? You certainly get the sense 
that it’s dominated by the usual suspects. 
More specifically, Samsung seems to have 
things sewn up with its 960 Pro drives.
So we extend a warm welcome to PNY 
with this, its entry-level enthusiast M.2 
drive. It’s powered by the Phison PS5007 
NVMe controller, which has been shaking 
things up versus some arguably more 
established control chips, and hooks up via 
a quad-channel PCI Express 3.0 interface.
It’s a quad-core controller, with some 
fairly lofty claims when it comes to internal 
house cleaning and in turn minimizing the 
performance delta between a full and 
empty drive. It also sports eight memory 
channels for maximum peak performance.
As for the PNY CS2030 itself, it uses 
relatively old-school 15nm Toshiba MLC 
planar or 2D NAND memory, instead of 
the more fashionable 3D TLC. That means 
lower data density, and it explains why PNY 
is only offering 240GB and 480GB models. 
To go beyond those capacities, PNY would 
have to opt for something larger than the 
M.2 2280 form factor seen here, which is 
22mm by 80mm, to ensure compatibility 
with a broad range of systems.
The upshot in terms of the CS2030’s 
on-paper capabilities at 240GB include 
A serious alternative 
to Samsung?

speeds 
of 
2,750MB/s and 1,500MB/s respectively, 
while IOPS come in at 201,000 and 215,000. 
For the record, its larger 480GB sibling 
rocks significantly superior numbers for 
random access performance, with IOPS at 
300,000 and 270,000 for reads and writes.
Number cruNchiNg
If that’s how this drive stacks up on paper, 
what’s it like when you throw some actual 
data at it? Pull some peak numbers 
with a test of throughput like ATTO Disk 
Benchmark, and you’ll be impressed. 
With reads of 3.1GB/s and writes around 
2.3GB/s, it not only exceeds PNY’s own 
claims, it hands the Intel 750 and Samsung 
950 Pro their derrières on a plate. It even 
trades blows with Samsung’s 960 Pro 2TB.
Of course, ATTO is about as theoretical 
as it comes. Shift the focus toward more 
taxing synthetic and real-world metrics, 
and the picture is more mixed. The CS2030 
is a whisker behind the older Samsung 950 
Pro in CrystalMark, for instance, whether 
that’s sequential or 4K random access 
performance, though the comparison drive 
in this case is a 512GB model. That said, the 
newer Samsung 960 blows this PNY drive 
away in CrystalMark sequential testing.
The CS2030 is also off the pace with our 
30GB internal file copy benchmark. It’s still

seriously quick by broader SSD standards, 
but the comparison with the very best isn’t 
flattering. Arguably more of a concern was 
our experience during pre-benchmarking 
preparations, which involve filling the drive 
with data, before deleting and allowing a 
little time for garbage collection to do its 
work. During the fill process, which mainly 
involves dumping large quantities of multi-
GB video files from another drive on to the 
testee, the best SSDs maintain consistent 
performance. But not the CS2030. It kicks 
off at high speed, but can only sustain 
that for short periods, which indicates a 
significant role in buffering technology to 
achieve the impressive peak numbers.
All of which means the CS2030 is pretty 
solid, but it isn’t quite a world-beater, and it 
needs to be cheaper to make a compelling 
case against the already entrenched SSD 
establishment. –Jeremy LaIrd

Back in 1944, Supreme Court Justice 
Robert H. Jackson, when talking about 
slightly more important things than a 
wireless headset, said that, “The price of 
freedom … is that we must put up with, 
and even pay for, a good deal of rubbish.” 
How right he was; while there’s a lot to 
absolutely adore about Logitech’s wireless 
G533 headset, there are also a few things 
you need to endure. So, let’s get through 
those first.
Closed-back earcups are a bit of a 
science to get right. These wobbly, circa-
30-degree twisters should, at least in 
theory, clamp down on a head of any shape. 
But we found an element of looseness, 
even after properly adjusting the decent 
ratcheted headband. You do settle in to 
the slightly sloppy fit after a while, though, 
but the same can’t necessarily be said 
for the fabric. It’s a rather rough mesh, 
fully washable, probably scientifically 
awesome, and we found it massively itchy. 
A good headset is one you forget you’re 
wearing—this is a headset you feel like 
you’re still wearing even some hours after 
taking it off.
The microphone offers up a double-
strike of emotion. It’s immensely cool 
in its design, clicking up flush with the 
right earcup to mute itself, hinging down 
satisfyingly, pulling out with a light tug, 
and not putting up a fight when you attempt 
to angle the bendy extension precisely 
where you want it to be. There’s even a 
dim, subtle red light to indicate when it’s 
muted. Beautiful. But then you speak into 
it. There’s virtually no mid-point; with the 
extension fully sheathed, the mic isn’t 
sensitive enough to satisfyingly pick up 
anything below an almost-shout, but when 
it’s anywhere near your mouth, it’s buzzy, 
clipping, and overpowered. It is possible 
to luck into a good position—and it’s worth 
pointing out that, wherever it is, it’s well 
Tireless wireless
pop-shielded, which is a major plus—but 
this is not a great mic by any means.
Audibly, things start to get a lot better. 
If we had to sum up the G533’s mix in one 
word, we’d choose “clean.” Thankfully, we 
have a few more words to play with: It’s a 
clear, untouched sound stage, with none 
of the infighting you might find in other 
headsets, even at very high volumes. The 
software DTS 7.1 surround sound is fine, 
and every frequency gets the same chance 
to shine. While it’s not as ludicrously 
booming or crunchy as some headsets, 
we come back to freedom; you’re free 
to enjoy anything you like, with no sense 
this headset is meant for something else. 
You’re free to tweak your own equalization 
in software, setting up personalized 
profiles on a per-game or per-program 
basis, and to do what you want with its 
entirely customizable button. And you’re 
free to enjoy all this within a decent range 
of its simple USB dongle, with such little 
lag that it’s completely imperceptible.
We never quite managed to walk the 
quoted 45 feet away from base. Our 
maximum range topped out at closer to 
20 feet, in a busy office full of wireless 
interference, but that’s not a bad result, 
and the connection never dropped or 
faltered while we were close. Pretty good, 
considering the battery life: Logitech 
quotes 15 hours, and we actually got 15 
hours from a full charge at a reasonable 
volume. Battery test results matching a 
manufacturer’s quote is almost unheard of, 
and the automatic power-off makes sure 
the G533 should be ready when you need it. 
If it’s not, plug a micro-USB cable into the 
ear, and you can charge them as you listen. 
There are no jack options and, since it runs 
a proprietary lossless wireless protocol, 
the G533 is tied to your PC. Not absolute 
freedom, then, but freedom at a price that, 
depending on your preferences, could be 
worth paying. –alex cox

We’re frequently told that we can’t 
have it all, but just as frequently, that’s a 
lie. You can’t work hard enough to attain 
a reasonable standard of living and still 
have a fulfilling life outside. You can’t have 
jelly on your spaghetti. You have to choose. 
Corsair seems to disagree, as the K95 
Platinum does, indeed, have it all. As long 
as you’re prepared to stump up a frankly 
eye-watering amount of green.
Yes, for the price of a Radeon RX 480, you 
can get a mechanical keyboard with all the 
trimmings. Macro keys, Cherry MX Speed 
switches, RGB lighting inserted into places 
you never thought possible. Aircraft-grade 
brushed anodized aluminum. Eight whole 
megabytes of storage for swappable 
profiles. A detachable, double-sided wrist 
rest. An honest-to-goodness, proper USB 
2.0 port, instead of a mere “charging” 
socket. A USB cable as thick as your finger, 
and a metal rolling volume control.
Visually, there’s a hint of the HyperX 
Alloy FPS we liked so much back in the 
February issue about the K95 Platinum, 
its edgeless design meaning the keys 
stand out proudly from the baseplate, 
and you can inspect their undersides 
like an over-friendly drill sergeant. The 
drawback to this kind of design is that it 
mercilessly exposes any flaws in your 
keyboard hygiene routine: Blackened grot, 
bits of old fingernail, and the crumbs of 
too many hastily eaten burritos will work 
themselves into the mechanism, or just 
lie between the keys. The caps are easily 
removed for cleaning, exposing the gray 
stems of the MX Speed switches. These 
Next up: gold-plated frames, and every key topped 
with rubies, sapphires, and emeralds
are clickless, like the more common Red 
variant, but activate after a mere 1.2mm 
of travel. The ubiquity of Cherry switches 
means the Platinum feels remarkably 
similar to other keyboards that use the 
same ones, but the light touch needed on 
the MX Speeds, mixed with the weightiness 
of the keyboard base, mean it’s a board 
that lends itself to quick use, and would 
make a fine first mechanical keyboard for 
the novice or upgrader.
Every key is programmable, but the 
dedicated macro keys, separated on the 
left, are distinguished by a different color 
on top, and a textured and cambered 
surface—it is possible you might hit G3 
while reaching for Tab, but you’ll know 
what you’ve done the second your fingertip 
hits the top of the key. The rest of the 
alphabet has a smooth, concave top, the 
letter cutouts reassuringly large and 
letting through plenty of that RGB light. 
Not content with every key (except for the 
macro keys) having RGB LEDs underneath, 
Corsair has taken inspiration from its 
absurd MM800 RGB Polaris mouse mat, 
and run a strip of lighting round the back 
and top edges of the keyboard, too.
All of this requires programing, of 
course, and duties are held by the usual 
Corsair Utility Engine software. It’s a 
nicely made bit of code that happily sits 
in the background, and can tie all your 
Corsair products together into one ungodly 
coruscating whole. 
So, having it all is possible, as long as 
you’re prepared to pay for it. There’s not 
much to criticize about the Platinum—
apart from the lack of actual platinum in 
its frame—except maybe that mandible-
slackening price. At this level of outlay, 
you have to really want the Platinum. The 
original K95, with the same switches, goes 
for around $50 less; the K70 Rapidfire 
knocks even more off; and the HyperX 
Alloy, with glorious clicky MX Blue 
switches, is half the price. The siren call of 
the lighting and that useful USB port will 
have to be strong, therefore, to prevent 
passing corsairs lashing themselves to the 
masts of their ships, and sailing on past to 
less expensive waters. –Ian evenden

Thanks To the aggressive prices of the 
latest UHD TVs, the value proposition of 
any given PC monitor is pretty parlous. 
Take the new ViewSonic XG2703-GS. For 
around $700, you get a paltry 27 inches of 
LCD panel, and a mere 2560x1440 pixels.
In UHD TV land, the astonishing reality is 
that $250 will buy you 40 inches and the full 
4K complement of 3840x2160 pixels. That’s 
nigh on one third the money for roughly 
twice the screen, by the major metrics.
Of course, UHD TVs are not directly 
comparable with PC monitors. What’s 
more, ViewSonic’s latest looks pretty 
clever next to what is arguably its nemesis, 
the Asus ROG Swift PG279Q. Both monitors 
check an awful lot of the same boxes. We’re 
talking 27-inch, WQHD resolution, IPS 
panel technology, 165Hz refresh capability, 
and support for Nvidia’s G-Sync adaptive 
frame synching tech. And yet the new 
XG2703-GS comes in at a full $100 cheaper 
than its Asus competition. Nice.
Indeed, ViewSonic has done a very nice 
job all round with its latest gaming panel. 
Straight out the box, it’s immediately 
obvious just what a nicely calibrated 
monitor this is. The colors really pop, 
without being over-saturated, and both 
the black and white scales are pretty much 
pitch perfect. This thing has balance.
As you’d expect for an IPS panel, the 
viewing angles are super. More of a 
surprise, perhaps, are the subjectively 
deep and inky black tones. Contrast 
performance is above the IPS norm. We 
really like the smooth, clean anti-glare 
coating, too. There’s hardly a whiff of that 
nasty grain and sparkle that blighted those 
IPS monitors of yore.
Likewise, support for up to 165Hz 
refresh just sweetens the deal, as does the 
lack of perceptible input lag, and G-Sync 
doing its buttery smooth thing in games. 
Add that to those rockin’ colors, the clean 
panel coating, the top-notch viewing 
angles, and the super-smooth rendering, 
and you have a near faultless package. 
The chassis is also a nice break from the 
ViewSonic norm, and comes complete with 
some slick plastics and green accents that 
hint at the Nvidia G-Sync technology inside. 
The stand is fully adjustable, to boot, 
including rotation into portrait mode. 
If you were determined to find fault, a 
little banding is visible in gradients, and 
the black levels can’t quite compete with 
the very best VA panels. Likewise, the 
165Hz refresh setting is buried under a

very silly “overclocking” heading in the 
on-screen menu, which is annoying more 
than actually debilitating in any way. And 
the Asus Swift is superficially a bit snazzier 
as a piece of consumer electronics. That 
aside, there’s virtually nothing in it.
With all that in mind, we’re struggling to 
come up with compelling reasons to pay the 
extra $100 for the Asus. But still that UHD 
TV comparison is hard to shake. Indeed, 
there are some 40-inch 4K PC monitors, 
albeit somewhat UHD TV derived, that come 
in well under the price of this panel. Heck, 
there are middle-budget smartphones that 
can match its pixel count.
Part of the problem is no doubt 
the inclusion of G-Sync. It requires a 
proprietary module inside the monitor that 
adds at least $100 to the eventual retail 
price. The high refresh capability and the 
quality IPS panel all add to the cost, too. 
All of these are industry-wide issues, not 
things specific to this monitor, of course. 
But as nice a screen as this ViewSonic is, 
$700 still feels like one hell of a lot for 
a 27-inch PC monitor with mere WQHD 
resolution. Hopefully, the market as a 
whole will realize this sooner rather than 
later, and the price of this kind of high-
performance 27-incher will come down a 
little. It needs to. –Jeremy Laird

future of processor cooling. They’ve come 
a long way over the last six years, from 
leaky, haphazard, nightmare-installation

So, what on earth could you do to make

since the Corsair H100i days, and apart 
from improving fan design, and beefing 
up the thickness of the radiator, there’s 
little, as far as we know, that can be done 
regarding performance gains.

improvements in the water block. All of 
NZXT’s second-generation coolers come 
featuring an infinity mirror on the CPU 
block itself, and on the outside of that is 
situated a fully RGB light ring, with an 
RGB NZXT logo in the middle, and one of 
the most advanced RGB controllers we’ve 
encountered. Pulsing, rainbow waves, 
ripple effects, color-switching, or simply 
static, there’s a true cornucopia of lighting 
profiles embedded into NZXT’s free CAM 
software, making this the best-looking AIO 
we’ve ever seen.
Installation hasn’t changed at all from 
the previous generation, and follows 
the usual fanfare associated with most 
mainstream AIO liquid coolers developed 
by Asetek. A simple plastic backplate 
slots through an Intel Z270 motherboard, 
followed by the four correct-length screws 
on the other side to lock it into place. Then 
it’s just a case of placing the water block 
down, threading the other end of the 
screws through the holes on the block, and 
securing with the thumb screws. Job done. 
This new gen of Kraken comes with two 
additional cables that need to be installed 
on the block, one with the pump header 
and an additional four fan headers, and one 
micro-USB to internal USB to be plugged 
in and installed into the motherboard. This 
allows NZXT’s CAM software to control fan 
profiles and LED lighting, and give you real-
time feedback on other system resources.
Overall performance is similar, if not 
identical, to the previous generation of 
Kraken cooler. We saw a temperature 
variance of 1–2 C in most scenarios. 
However, that’s well within margin of error 
and variances in air temperature. NZXT’s 
new fan designs are also pretty slick. 
There’s nothing fancy, in terms of RGB 
lighting, or anything out of the ordinary, 
and the max noise does peak up to 38dBA—
which, for a 140mm fan, is pretty crazy. 
However, they do keep the AIO well chilled, 
and can be replaced with NZXT’s RGB Aer 
fans if so desired.
Ultimately, the Kraken X62 is a well-
crafted, 
beautifully 
stunning 
280mm 
AIO. Yep, there may be cheaper AIOs out 
there, but we can tell you right now that 
you won’t find one better looking or more 
complementary to any system. –ZAk storey

Fetch an umbrella, it looks nasty out there
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
Resident evil 4 was quite good. However, 
the series has seen a bit of a downturn in 
quality since 2005, so hopes were high that 
Capcom could return to past triumphs with 
the seventh main-line game.
It certainly delivers. Resi 7 is a break 
from the fast-headshotting crowd-control 
style of the past decade, dropping even the 
once-innovative over-the-shoulder camera 
in favor of good old first-person. The other 
thing that’s changed is the globetrotting 
of Resi 6. Resi 7 is tightly framed, much of 
its action taking place around one house 
in the Louisiana swamps. It’s a throwback 
to the older games that were set in a lone 
mansion, but also a step forward, as it 
allows the designers to concentrate on 
puzzles and scares, rather than creating 
vast environments. Claustrophobia and 
isolation are very much the order of the day. 
It’s a good hour before guns are even 
introduced, and the feeling of vulnerability 
is cut by relief as you finally get something 
offensive, only to return as you realize 
how ineffective it is. Couple this with a 
save system from the 1980s—manual, and 
only in certain places—plus the series’s 
notorious item-juggling, and the thought 
of what could be lurking around every dark 
corner gets very tense. (You can undo the 
work that’s gone into the game’s oppressive 
atmosphere by changing the gamma setting 
so everything’s lit up like Times Square, but 
surely only a chicken would do that....)
The influence of cinema on Resident 
Evil has always been clear, but Resi 7’s 
makers have been watching different 
movies. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has 
been in the VCR as much as Evil Dead, with 
Leatherface’s disgusting home informing 
the design of this old house. The derelict 
plantation’s inhabitants come straight from 
that movie, too, while hanging totems evoke 
The Blair Witch Project, and the sultry, 
swampy, unsettling ambiance could come 
straight from season one of True Detective. 
The found-footage genre is particularly in 
abundance, thanks to collectable tapes that 
open side missions, in which you join the 
cameramen on their explorations.
Some things never change, however, 
and mysterious serums, bioweapons, and 
Papa Baker has a lot of charming 
qualities, fire resistance being 
just one of them.
even a certain corporation all raise their 
mutated heads over the game’s 15 or so 
hours. The new engine led to a VR version 
of the game on PlayStation. The thought of 
crashing around a room while trying to tear 
a Rift from our face almost makes us glad it 
hasn’t yet made it to PC in this form.
Resi 7 is filled with ways to make the old 
feel new again. Its tight design, new engine, 
and keen understanding of how to unsettle 
the player make this one of the finest horror 
games to see the outside of a mysterious 
laboratory in living memory. –ian evenden

Man is the most dangerous game
Sniper Elite 4
There’s an obvious poinT of comparison 
when considering Sniper Elite, Rebellion’s 
sneak-around-and-kill-Nazis 
game: 
Hitman. But while IO’s episodic title sees 
you travel the world in search of individual 
targets, in Sniper Elite everyone’s game for 
a bullet in the skull. Because they’re Nazis.
Dropped into a plot concerning Hitler’s 
latest wonder weapon, Karl Fairburne 
finds himself in 1940s Italy, acting as a kind 
of one-man army. He totes a sighted rifle, 
plus a couple of secondary weapons, and a 
holdall of explosives with which he can blow 
his own cover. The game’s main focus is on 
the rifle, and stealthy, long-range kills, but 
it also encourages you to get up close and 
personal by making you search corpses and 
slaughter everyone you come across.
The game’s kill-cams keep up the 
entertainment. Get a hit on a particularly 
sensitive part of an enemy, and the camera 
circles round while the victim’s skeleton is 
revealed, all bulging eyeballs and grinning 
teeth, showing the bullet tearing through 
bone or your knife slicing arteries. Knowing 
you’re likely to trigger one of these gory 
mini cutscenes adds extra enjoyment as 
you see the crosshairs turn red.
On a second playthrough of a level, we 
discovered we could take out the mission’s 
main target and a great many roaming 
soldiers from a tower, using a small supply 
of suppressed ammo and good timing 
to keep our location secret. Seeing their 
general lose his head and get stuck against 
a fence wasn’t too much of a trauma for his 
bodyguards, who went on a brief, localized 
sniper-hunting spree before resuming their 
patrols in front of his cooling corpse. 
This is the AI at its worst, but when you’re 
in the thick of the action, its ability to search, 
as well as react to gunfire and unexpected 
sounds, means being discovered is always 
a possibility, no matter how well hidden you 
are. Italy’s overgrown backyards and the 
patches of dense scrub on its more open 
plains mean it’s possible to circumvent 
trouble by dodging from hiding place to 
hiding place, eventually settling on the 
perfect spot from which to sight your target.
Your secondary weapons, which start out 
as submachine guns and pistols but can be 
upgraded to shotguns or rocket launchers, 
mean running gunfights aren’t out of the 
question. They’re best entered into against 
small groups who can’t call reinforcements, 
and out of earshot of larger bands, as a flow 
of troops into an area can ruin your fun, 
though a knowledge of your surroundings 
pays dividends if you have to run and hide.
Sniper Elite games may look like they’re 
churned out on a production line, but this one 
shows genuine craft, and an understanding 
of what makes stalking your prey fun. That it 
also provides gory gratification just makes 
it easier to recommend. –ian evenden

Zak Storey, reviews editor
It’s that tIme agaIn, when I have to begin 
looking at which GPU benchmarks we’ll 
be using for the coming year. Our CPU and 
motherboard benchmarks had their revamp 
early in January, just as Intel and AMD began 
to launch their new platforms. And now, as 
we expect new GPUs to arrive over the next 
four months, it’s time we banished some of 
our older benchmark titles, and invested in 
some new ones for our GPU suite.
The question is, which benchmarks 
should we use? Getting a healthy mix of both 
Nvidia and AMD sponsored titles is key, of 
course, to avoid any bias, and we’ll need to 
nab some DX12 and DX11 tests, too.
But how do we test? There are two routes 
we can take: Either we can use an integrated 
benchmark, something akin to Total War’s 
Attila; or we can use a custom, in-game run 
instead. The thing is, both methods have 
their downsides. Integrated benchmarks 
are often optimized to show a title running 
at its very best, and are never indicative 
of a scenario in game; while in-game 
benchmarks are trickier to perform, and 
infinitely more difficult to repeat in order to 
guarantee 100 percent accuracy.
This brings up an interesting point, 
especially when you’re looking at our 
benchmarks, those of other publications, 
or even those of YouTubers. In reality, 
GPU 
benchmarks 
should 
always 
be 
analyzed only within the context of the one 
journalistic outlet from which they come, 
and taken with a pinch of salt. That’s not to 
say people are fudging their numbers, just 
that the variance in test benches, how they 
perform the benchmark, what settings they 
use, and how they record those figures all 
varies so wildly that you can guarantee no 
two reviews ever look the same. That said, 
if you’re looking to see where your system 
falls on those scales, your best bet is to use 
something like 3DMark’s Fire Strike, or an 
integrated benchmark for which you know 
the graphical profile settings your favorite 
reviewer uses, and go from there.
Or how you should take everything with a pinch of salt
The Problem With 
Benchmarks
I recently saw a video where a 
gaming enthusiast managed 
to install Doom—yes, the 
game—on his Porsche’s in-
dash entertainment system. At 
first, I thought this was really 
cool. Unfortunately, to control 
and move the protagonist, the 
driver had to use his Porsche’s 
steering wheel, and drive the 
vehicle around. I can’t stress 
enough how dangerous this 
As you’ve no doubt realized, 
we spend a lot of time 
talking 
about—and 
getting 
excited 
about—crazy 
high-
end systems on Maximum 
PC. However, right now, I’m 
actually psyched about the 
low end. That’s largely to do 
with the Intel Pentium G4560, 
a low-end processor that gives 
you just enough power to not 
bottleneck your graphics. Of 
is. While it may be a cool 
exercise to try to install Doom 
on your car’s computer, it’s 
just another vector for bad 
things to happen. Technology 
is always being added to cars 
to make driving safer, but a lot 
of drivers fail to even use their 
car’s turn signals, and that’s a 
standard technology available 
on every car. Basic life things 
first; cool tech later.
course, you’re not going to pair 
a $600 GPU with a $60 CPU—
that wouldn’t make a whole 
lot of sense—but dropping the 
G4560 into a budget gaming 
build means that you can put 
together a GTX 1060 or RX 
470-powered system for less 
than $500. A system that’ll 
hold down 60fps at 1080p 
without breaking a sweat. 
Finally, a true console-killer.

Great for those in HR, finance, and

These aren’t the chips I’m most excited

Which is why the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 
have piqued my interest. We won’t see the 
seriously-budget-focused Ryzen 3 until the 
second half of the year, but we should see 
the Ryzen 5 this side of summer. 
The Ryzen 5 1600X is a six-core, 12-thread 
chip running at 3.6GHz (4GHz Turbo), while 
the Ryzen 5 1500X is a quad-core, eight-
thread chip thrumming along at 3.5GHz 
(3.7GHz Turbo). Both are intriguing, but it’s 
the six-core chip that I’m desperate to drop

Ryzen right now is $329, we should have a 
decent Core i5-beater on our hands.

GeFoRce GTX 1080 Ti
Nvidia has just revealed 
its latest and greatest 
graphics card, and it’s 
a doozy. The GTX 1080 
Ti cranks the dial all 
the way to 11—literally. It uses the same 
GP102 GPU as the Titan X, with the same 
3,584 CUDA cores, but it comes with 11GB 
of GDDR5X memory, clocked at 11Gbps. It 
also has higher GPU clocks than the Titan X, 
and a price that replaces the old GTX 1080 
Founders Edition. Speaking of which, there 
will be 1080 Ti FE cards, but they won’t be 
priced any higher than the custom cards.
So, the Titan X has become a status 
symbol that’s no longer the fastest GPU 
on the planet. The 1080 Ti will outperform 
it by around five percent—unless you can 
find a workload that uses more than 11GB of 
memory but less than 12GB, and does so in 
a way that puts the Titan ahead of its more 
cost-effective sibling. This is also the most 
powerful Ti card, relative to the stock 1080, 
with performance over 30 percent higher.
Nvidia has used improved GDDR5X yields 
to hit 11Gbps, and has reworked elements 
of power and cooling. Using the same 220W 
load, Nvidia says the 1080 Ti cooler can run 
5 C lower than the 1080, or be 2.5dB quieter. 
Don’t fret if you couldn’t justify the cost of the 
Titan X; the 1080 Ti is a Titan-killer.

WE TACKLE TOUGH READER QUESTIONS ON...
Upgradeable GPUs
This topic comes up quite a 
bit in the magazine, but ever 
since I bought my first Intel 
quad-core CPU, I’ve been 
off the clock, so to speak, 
when it comes to upgrading 
motherboards and CPUs 
in tandem. Never quite 
satisfied, and always feeling 
behind the cutting edge, I’ve 
hit my budget for now at a 
Z97 with a Core i5-4690K. 
Lately, I’m seeing the speed 
of video cards running the 
same pattern. For instance, 
an upgrade to a 4GB GTX 960 
early last year is already 
choking on anything but 16:9 
frame rates. Do you think 
we’ll ever see the great 
Red versus Green teams 
introduce technology where 
we’re upgrading a video 
card, rather than changing 
them out completely each 
year or two? –Ryan Anthony
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: Keeping 
bang up to date with the 
latest technology can be 
a pricey pastime, but, 
realistically, very few 
of us live on the cutting 
edge, or indeed need to. 
If you’re happy with your 
system’s performance—
or you’re happy to dial 
back the settings in order 
to keep the frame rates 
smooth enough—that’s 
all that really matters. 
However, when it comes to 
upgrading, we generally 
recommend going with the 
latest and greatest gear, 
because that will last you 
the longest time until your 
next upgrade.
As for Nvidia and AMD 
changing the way they make 
and sell graphics cards, I 
can’t see this happening any 
time soon, simply because 
the rate of progress is 
still so incredible. Both 
companies have big plans 
on the memory front at the 
moment, and that affects 
pretty much everything 
about the design of the 
next generation of graphics 
cards. This, coupled with 
the fact that the graphics 
card market is quite healthy 
right now, suggests that 
the situation isn’t going to 
change any time soon. 
Speedier Boot Times
Interestingly, while reading 
your March 2017 issue, I 
noticed Zak Storey’s article 
entitled: “Boot Times.” He 
speaks about the lengthy 
boot times that seem to be 
associated with using the 
newer PCIe SSDs or M.2 
drives as a boot device.
I found this not to always 
be the case. I have an MSI 
Z270 Gaming M7 board, with 
a shiny new Core i7-7700K, 
and I am using a Samsung 
950 Pro as my boot drive in 
the middle M.2 slot (with 
the latest Samsung NVMe 
driver). The only BIOS 
settings I changed from 
default when I installed the 
M.2 (and Windows 10 Pro) 
were to enable the Windows 
8.1/10 WHQL Support, and 
disable the MSI Fast Boot, as 
recommended by users on

about nine seconds from 
button-press—slightly 
faster than my previous 
build, which had a Samsung 
840 EVO SSD as the boot 
drive. Obviously, there are a 
plethora of variables here, 
but depending on what 
motherboard you are using, 
and what particular BIOS 
settings, a PCIe SSD can be 
a blazing-fast boot device. 
Try hitting the john before 
my system is ready after 
pressing the power button. I 
hope you can pee fast!

rEsponds: I’ve seen plenty 
of speedy boot times over 
the years, using a variety 
of hardware, which is why 
it struck me as being so 
odd that one of my builds 
was struggling so much. I 
tried various things to sort 
out the problems, but in 
the end swapped out the 
motherboard—which, as an 
aside, proved that it wasn’t 
the SSD at fault. 
Juggling Upgrades
Love the magazine. I suspect 
I am one of your older 
readers, as I am 77 and still 
building my own PCs. I have 
a rig that was pretty high-
end when I built it several 
years ago, but it’s getting 
a bit long in the tooth now. 
Here are its specs:
• Intel Core i7-2600K
•  Asus P68-V Pro Gen 3 
motherboard
•  16GB Corsair 1600 
DDR3 RAM
•  Asus Radeon HD 7970 
Direct CUII TOP GPU
•  Antec HCG-900 900W PSU
• Crucial M500 960GB SSD
•  2x WD Black 7,200rpm 2TB 
storage drives
•  LiteOn DVDRW LH-20A1L 
optical drive
•  Asus VW222 1680x1050 
monitor
•  Windows 10 Home 
Premium
I do routine Word and 
Excel tasks, web browsing,

with basic tools such as 
AVS Video Editor. And, of 
course, I like to play top-title 
games of various genres at 
high-quality settings.
Although I’m satisfied 
with how my rig handles 
all of the stuff I do, I would 
like to replace my monitor 
with a 27-inch 2560x1440 
one, perhaps an Asus ROG 
Swift PG278Q.
Question 1: Do you think 
the problems surrounding 
the use of 4K monitors 
will soon be resolved, and 
that it would be a mistake 
to purchase a 2560x1440 
monitor at this point?
Question 2: If you think a 
2560x1440 monitor is a good 
choice, what do you think of 
the Asus ROG Swift PG278Q 
in particular? Would you 
recommend it, or perhaps 
something else?
Question 3: Do you think my 
rig would provide adequate 
frame rates in demanding 
games at high settings on 
a 2560x1440 monitor? I 
suspect not, so…
Question 4: Although I’d love 
to build an entirely new rig 
with all the latest goodies, 
my wallet won’t support that 
at this time. I’m wondering 
whether I can rock a new 
2560x1440 monitor simply 
by replacing my GPU with a 
current top-end Nvidia GTX 
1080 GPU of some ilk, and 
get by until the rig is just not 
up to the demands of next-
gen games. Then, when I do 
eventually replace the CPU/
mobo/boot SSD/memory and 
so on, I could continue to 
use the 2560x1440 monitor 
and GTX 1080 GPU, perhaps 
adding a second GTX 1080 
in SLI (that is, unless at 
that point they, too, have 
become obsolete).
So, what do you think? I’d 
appreciate any and all advice 
you can offer.
–Salvatore Mazzone
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: The 
“problem” with 4K is that we 
haven’t yet seen a monitor 
that checks all of our dream 
screen boxes—high refresh 
rates, HDR, perfect size, and 
4K panels simply don’t exist 
right now. They’re coming, 
but they’re going to be 
pricey, and if you’re looking 
to buy a graphics card at the 
same time, then your budget 
may well be stretched to 
breaking point. Driving 
that many pixels isn’t easy 
either—even the best cards 
right now can struggle in 
some games at the highest 
settings at 4K. 
Grabbing yourself a 
beefy GTX 1080 certainly 
won’t hurt your options, 
though, and we still have a 
weakness for a good quality 
2560x1440 screen—so, 
yes, we would find it quite 
easy to get behind your 
suggestion of upgrading 
your graphics card now, and 
coupling it with a quality 
1440p panel. The Asus ROG 
Swift PG278Q is a good TN 
panel, but it is getting a bit 
old now, and we’ve seen a 
few competing screens pop 
up that have tickled our 
fancy a touch more—such as 
the IPS AOC Agon AG271QG 
(currently on Amazon for 
$620) that we reviewed in 
our January issue, or there’s 
the ViewSonic XG2703-GS, 
which you’ll find reviewed 
this issue on page 86. 
Beating the Budget
I have been an avid reader 
of Maximum PC for a while, 
and it is a great magazine, 
but I just wanted to point out 
some flaws with the $300 
budget build article. I feel 
that by just picking parts at 
MSRP, you are not only not 
making the best out of the 
budget, but also encouraging 
people to do the same. I have 
built two PCs—one last year 
for me, and one this winter 
for my friend, who wanted 
to get into PC gaming. They 
were both built with a budget 
of $325, and I was able to 
get an Intel Core i3-6100 and 
R9 270X, and an AMD Athlon 
X4-860K and R9 380 in each 
of them respectively, with 
8GB of RAM. I spent a lot of 
time picking out the parts, 
and bought most of each 
build from Craigslist. This 
includes the case, PSU, 
RAM, and the R9 270X. This 
just shows that if you really 
want a decent cheap build, 
it is possible if you just work 
to find good deals and used 
parts. 
–Keegan Pelton
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: While I 
agree with your sentiment, 
in practice there are plenty 
of things that make it a 
tricky route to follow in 
the magazine—one-off 
sales that aren’t available 
by the time we go to press 
aren’t much use to the vast 
majority of our readers. 
There’s also the problem 
with hardware not working 
and not being covered by 
warranties, or being tricked 
by the more unscrupulous 
sellers. Having said all that, 
we genuinely do see this 
as a great way of making 
tight budgets stretch that 
little bit further. This also 
touches on a challenge 
we’ve been meaning to do 
for a while now—seeing how 
much machine you can get 
second-hand for the very 
smallest of budgets, and 
what you need to spend to 
turn them into full-fledged 
systems. Watch this space. 
Dead Pixels
As Ultra HD monitors have 
more pixels than 1080p 
Full HD ones, do they get 
more dead pixels? And, 
therefore, do they have a 
shorter lifespan? 
–Rusoha
scrEEn ExpErt JErEmy 
lAird rEsponds: While 
you’re correct that, in 
theory, Ultra HD has a 
greater risk of dead pixels, 
I can’t remember the last 
time I saw one—and I see 
a lot more screens than 
most. There is the point, as 
well, that as the pixels get 
smaller and smaller, the 
impact is less obvious—in 
fact, unless a pixel was 
stuck on bright near the 
center, you’d be hard pushed 
to spot it most of the time. 
This doesn’t generally affect 
the lifespan either.

How mucH RAm do you 
ReAlly need foR gAming? 
How much RAM do you 
really need for gaming? 
Time was that 4GB was 
more than enough for 
gaming and most daily 
tasks, but those days are 
in the past. If you have too 
little RAM—4GB, say—
there’s a good chance that 
a lot of the games you want 
to play just won’t run, or at 
least won’t run well. Mass 
Effect: Andromeda, for 
example, lists 8GB of RAM 
as the required minimum, 
falling in line with many 
other modern games. 
And even for those that 
have a minimum of 4 or 
6GB, 8GB is definitely 
recommended, because 
other programs on your PC 
run in the background.

At the time of writing, Newegg has a deal that shaves $10 of the 
usual retail price of the Core i5-7600K. Normally, we avoid such 
short-lived offers, but in the case of the Core i5, you can assume there 
will be rolling deals for a while, as Intel responds to the release of 
Ryzen. Elsewhere, we’ve switched graphics card vendor again this 
month, because Zotac’s compact GeForce GTX 1070 saw a healthy 
price cut. It also comes with your pick of either For Honor or Ghost 
Recon: Wildlands. This deal is spearheaded by Nvidia, and it’s a 
common sight when picking up a new graphics card; although it’s 
worth noting that they are often time- or game-limited. Graphics card 
aside, the machine is identical to last month’s build, with a few subtle 
price tweaks here and there—RAM increased a little (no surprise), 
as did Corsair’s H100i V2, but the savings on the GPU and CPU meant 
that, overall, we managed to save $8 compared to last month’s build. 
there Aren’t A lot of chAnges for our budget rig this month, 
with only the fight against increasing prices forming any serious 
difference. Pricing for the 3GB spin of the 1060 continues to be 
volatile, with last month’s choice seeing a $10 price bump, so we’ve 
gone for the EVGA card this month instead. RAM pricing continues its 
upward spiral, too, but we managed to grab a pair of G.Skill sticks for 
a reasonable price. SSDs are mimicking this trend as well, forcing us 
to swap out to one of SanDisk’s Z400s again—a solid budget option 
that we’ve used before. It’s hard to say for sure why there’s been a 
5 percent price drop on the Pentium G4600, because we suspect 
that the launch of Ryzen hasn’t impacted Intel’s budget offering, but 
you never know. We expect more shifts in pricing over the next few 
months, though, so it definitely pays to shop around a bit. Overall, our 
budget build saw its price tag increase by $22.

All chAnge At the top. We did briefly consider holding off on 
recommending Ryzen so soon after release, but we’ve been so 
impressed by the performance that we feel the need to endorse it from 
day one. The Ryzen 7 1800X boasts two more cores than the 6800K 
that it replaces, which means software has four more threads to play 
with—a significant difference  for plenty of high-end applications.
A new processor means a new motherboard. At this stage, it’s 
hard to know for sure whether the Asus Crosshair VI Hero is the best 
available, but it checks plenty of boxes when it comes to features 
and overclocking potential (even if Ryzen doesn’t seem to want to 
overclock too much). On the memory front, we’ve gone a slightly 
different route to Intel’s quad-channel offering, picking up a pair of 
16GB Vengeance LPX DDR4-2666 sticks, for a total of 32GB—plenty 
for high-end work. We’ve also picked up the newer Kraken X62 
cooler, because it’s one of the first to support AMD’s new AM4 socket.
The other notable change is on the graphics front: Prices for the 
GeForce GTX 1080 have dropped to around the $500 mark since 
Nvidia announced that the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti was on the way. While 
the 1080 Ti will undoubtedly be the card to lust after the moment it 
hits the shelves, that shouldn’t detract from the fact that the straight 
1080 now offers great value for money. In fact, this DUKE rendition 
boasts a healthy overclock of 1,708MHz (101MHz over the base clock).

It’s hard to state exactly what kind of effect Ryzen has had on the 
entirety of the processor ecosystem, but we’d put good money 
on it putting Intel on the back foot. This is likely to be the end of 
the quad-core processor being the norm for the mainstream, 
and not soon enough, we say. The Ryzen 7 1800X is the core that 
started this revolution, bringing HEDT-class performance at 
an affordable price point. The chipset may not be perfect right 
now, and AMD’s definitely going to be working on those teething 
problems, but for the price, that pro-grade performance is 
nothing short of exceptional.
