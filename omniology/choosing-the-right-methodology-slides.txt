Choosing the Right Methodology

Module Objectives
 Overview of the different methodologies
- PASTA
- Microsoft Threat Modeling
- OCTAVE
- TRIKE
- VAST
 Advantages and disadvantages of each
 How to choose a methodology

Threat Modeling
Risk Analysis
Threat Analysis
Comparing Methodologies…

Asset-Centric
Approaches Covered During This Course
Attacker-Centric
Application-Centric

PASTA

What Is PASTA
Process for Attack Simulation and Threat 
Analysis
Threat analysis and threat modeling
Asset-centric approach
7 Stages

PASTA Process
Perform Impact Analysis
Enumerate Attacks
Identify Vulnerabilities
Analyze Threats
Decompose Application
Define Technical Scope
Define Business Objectives

PASTA Key Elements
Targeted towards
Medium to large size companies
Mature companies
Having security knowledge
Executive sponsorship necessary
Iterative, maturing process
Outcome is geared towards management

 Advantages
Great for business integration
Mature, well described processes
Lots of documentation
Tooling available
 Disadvantages
Specialized input necessary
Time consuming
Each step generates output
A lot of intermediate models
Output depends on dynamic input
PASTA

Microsoft Threat Modeling

What Is Microsoft Threat Modeling
Threat modeling framework
Sometimes incorrectly named STRIDE
STRIDE is threat classification system
Focuses on technical risk
Developer-driven
Application-centric approach

Microsoft Threat Modeling Process
Identify 
Assets
Create 
Architecture 
Overview
Decompose 
Application
Identify 
Threats
Document 
Threats
Rate Threats

Microsoft Threat Modeling Key Elements
Targeted towards development teams
Simple, lightweight
Practical approach
Plain language
Widely adopted

 Advantages
Easy to pick up
Can be easily integrated into SDLC
Very flexible
 Disadvantages
More practical than academic
STRIDE classification is redundant
Does not factor in business risks
Microsoft Threat Modeling

OCTAVE

What Is OCTAVE
Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and 
Vulnerability Evaluation
Risk analysis framework
Evaluates organization
Different versions
- OCTAVE
- OCTAVE-S
- OCTAVE Allegro
“Asset-centric approach”

OCTAVE Process
Establish 
Drivers
Profile 
Assets
Identify 
Threats
Mitigate 
Risks

OCTAVE Key Elements
Each version targets ‘different’ organization
Focus on organizational risk
Not technical risk
Focus on security practices
Strategic issues
Flexible, self direction
Series of workshops

 Advantages
Improves risk-aware corporate culture
Creates organization wide risk overview
In-depth
Flexible
 Disadvantages
Large and complex
Lots of paperwork
Requires ‘investment’
OCTAVE

TRIKE

What Is Trike
Methodology as well as tool
High levels of automation are possible
Asset-centric approach
Focus on defensive side

Trike Process
Model 
System
Identify 
Threats
Investigate 
Threats
Identify 
Mitigations
Investigate 
Mitigations

Trike Key Elements
Targeted towards security auditing teams
Three models
Requirements model
Implementation model
Risk model

 Advantages
Automatically generates threats
Consistent results
Built-in tool
 Disadvantages
Does not scale
Not maintained / defunct / unfinished ?
Trike

VAST

What Is VAST
Visual Agile Simple Threat Modeling
Two threat model types
- Application threat model
- Operational threat model
Uses process flow diagram

VAST Key Elements
Targeted towards agile companies
Scalable

 Advantages
Flexible
Scalable
Process flow diagrams might be easier
 Disadvantages
Not an open methodology
No documentation or guidance
VAST

 Best methodology depends on
- Team
- Organization
- Goal
 Asset-centric
- PASTA
 Application-centric
- Microsoft Threat Modeling
Summary

Choose methodology
based on team, 
organization and objective
