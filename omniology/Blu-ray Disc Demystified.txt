“BD Demystified is an essential reference for designers and developers building with-
in Blu-ray’s unique framework and provides them with the knowledge to deliver a
compelling user experience with seamlessly integrated multimedia.”
— Lee Evans, Ambient Digital Media, Inc., Marina del Rey, CA
“Jim’s Demystified books are the definitive resource for anyone wishing to learn
about optical media technologies.”
— Bram Wessel, CTO and Co-Founder, Metabeam Corporation
“As he did with such clarity for DVD, Jim Taylor (along with his team of experts)
again lights the way for both professionals and consumers, pointing out the sights,
warning us of the obstacles and giving us the lay of the land on our journey to a new
high-definition disc format.”
— Van Ling, Blu-ray/DVD Producer, Los Angeles, CA
“Blu-ray Disc Demystified is an excellent reference for those at all levels of BD pro-
duction.  Everyone from novices to veterans will find useful information contained
within. The authors have done a great job making difficult subjects like AACS
encryption, BD-Java, and authoring for Blu-ray easy to understand.”
— Jess Bowers, Director, Technical Services, 1K Studios, Burbank, CA
“Like its red-laser predecessor, Blu-ray Disc Demystified will immediately take its
rightful place as the definitive reference book on producing BD.  No authoring
house should undertake a Blu-ray project without this book on the author’s desk.  If
you are new to Blu-ray, this book will save you time, money, and heartache as it
guides the DVD author through the new spec and production details of producing
for Blu-ray.”
— Denny Breitenfeld, CTO, NetBlender, Inc., Alexandria, VA
“An all in one encyclopedia of all things BD.”
— Robert Gekchyan, Lead Programmer/BD Technical Manager
Technicolor Creative Services, Burbank, CA

“So what sort of business are you in?” I am asked by a bored traveler sitting next
to me on an airplane trip, sometime in 2004.
“A new technology called Blu-ray Disc™,”  I answer.
“Blue.....uh......what?”
“Blu-ray Disc. It’ll be a next generation disc format – similar to DVD –but this one
is going to be high definition. You know, HDTV on a disc that looks and feels just
like a DVD when you hold it in your hand. You won’t believe how great the picture
looks on a decent HDTV set.”  A flicker of hopeful recognition at “DVD” and
“HDTV”. Then, suddenly, a dark look.
“Wait a minute. Does that mean I have to throw away all of my DVDs? Already??
Why do we need another disc format, anyway?”
This exchange illustrates a pretty common set of questions I’ve encountered in
recent years in my role as a spokesperson for the Blu-ray Disc format: Do we really
need a new disc format? Isn’t DVD good enough?
To make things even more challenging, a confusing format war between Blu-ray
and another high-definition disc format broke out, causing many pundits to proclaim
that unlike DVD, that overnight sensation from the mid-nineties, a newfangled
“blue” format would likely have a tough time even making it to market, let alone suc-
ceeding.
There is a great deal of irony in this thinking. If you have followed DVD’s progress
since the format first appeared in late 1996 – perhaps by being a faithful reader of
DVD Demystified, the predecessor of  this book – you already know that it actually
took years for that format to become the “overnight sensation” that many people
seem to remember now. In fact, about two years after DVD hit the market, one ana-
lyst concluded that VHS had a “long and healthy life ahead”, and another deter-
mined that DVD sales were “slow to take off, partly due to consumer confusion”.
The thinking was that since few people had heard of DVD and no one had asked for
it, why did we need a new format?
Actually, just about everyone needed it, as it soon turned out. After about three
uncertain years on the market, consumers began to fall in love with DVD, and sales
of players and discs increased dramatically. DVD quickly became the fastest grow-
ing consumer format in history, and everyone lived happily ever after.
So if DVD appears to have a long and healthy life ahead of it and no one was ask-
ing for Blu-ray Disc, why do we need a new format? As you can see, it’s a familiar
question, and the fact that you are reading this book shows you already know the
answer.
Foreword

DVD managed to squeeze a remarkable degree of picture quality out of broadcast
TV standards that were introduced more than fifty years ago. But, by early 2009, the
United States’ venerable old “480i” NTSC broadcast system will be shut off and
replaced with high-definition signals containing up to six times more picture infor-
mation. The long dream of upgrading from an old, noise-prone analog TV system to
a new, crystal clear digital one is finally happening, and the electronics industry is
embracing the change with all its might. Walk into a typical electronics retail store,
and you’ll notice that every single TV is displaying beautiful high definition images
on newly affordable flat-panel TVs that you can hang on your wall. Recent advances
in video projection technology are bringing the “theater” to home theaters like never
before, since HDTV enables stunning picture quality on much larger screens than
standard definition could ever support.
In short, high-definition technology is bringing the full visual and sonic impact of
filmed entertainment into your home with a mesmerizing clarity that was only a dis-
tant promise ten years ago. In the home video world, this is a Very Big Deal – a tec-
tonic change of a magnitude we have not experienced since the introduction of color
TV decades ago.
Given this momentous high-definition revolution, should we all just keep watch-
ing programs on the same old standard- definition DVD format forever? Or, should
we also have a new high-definition disc format that shows just what that marvelous
1080p display you recently bought can really do? Such a new format is already here,
and it’s called Blu-ray Disc.
Blu-ray’s designers realized that the opportunity to create a new worldwide disc
format doesn’t come along every day. They knew that, historically, optical disc for-
mats have always provided the very best picture and sound that the technology of the
day could deliver, from analog LaserDisc in the ‘80’s to digital DVD in the ‘90’s. So
the new Blu-ray Disc format first needed enough high-def horsepower to exceed
what anyone had ever seen or heard before, including even the best 1080i broad-
casts. This is why so much effort was made to provide a lavish amount of storage
capacity and data throughput: the ultimate, archive quality version of a program
deserves no less.
But Blu-ray Disc also needed to offer more than the absolute best picture and
sound. It needed to provide new ways to go far deeper into a film-viewing experience
than DVD could ever deliver. Don’t get me wrong – in 1996, DVD was an exciting
new technology that greatly improved the home video experience compared to tape.
But just look at some of the features the Blu-ray format offers using today’s tech-
nology: a full-fledged programming language for in-movie games, education and
interactive exploration; two simultaneous video channels that allow film-school-
quality director commentaries; far superior graphics with less disruptive “popup”
menus; and, with BD-Live, even a connection to the Internet that can extend the
x x

original linear film into something much more immersive, interactive and social. If
I’ve learned anything in nearly 30 years in this business, it’s that giving powerful new
tools to highly creative people almost always results in something ingenious and
compelling. Give it some time – you’ll see.
Meanwhile, the timing of this new book, Blu-ray Disc Demystified, is superb. The
industry has settled on a single high-definition disc format, thereby removing any
need to hedge bets or sit on a fence. As I write this, Blu-ray is already beginning to
see substantial growth in the marketplace, so it’s an ideal time to learn all about how
the format works and what it can do for you.
If you’ve had the pleasure of reading any of Jim Taylor’s earlier DVD Demystified
books, you already know that they have been a treasure for those seeking more than
a just a thorough technical analysis. This new book continues the highly successful
blend of carefully researched factual information and industry insight that the other
books have become known for, and, as always, no punches are pulled along the way.
You will find a unique perspective of the history, practical applications, and even
some of the common myths surrounding the format, all written in an accessible style
that makes for an enjoyable and engaging read. Jim and his co-authors have done it
again, so whether your profession requires you to know about Blu-ray Disc or you
just have an interest in knowing how this wonderful new technology works, you’ve
come to the right place.

I’ve concluded that writing a book is a bit like having a baby (although clearly not
in the same league). It takes a few years before you forget just how hard it was —
enough that you rashly sign up for another one. And, as with a child, you hope that
it comes out all right and that people like it when you let it loose on the world.
Luckily, I had a team of similarly rash co-authors who made it all possible. I am
indebted to Chuck, Chris, and Mike for their knowledge, their hard work, and their
good natures. Special thanks again to Samantha Cheng for keeping everything
together and everyone on track. I’d like to acknowledge my colleagues at Sonic
Solutions, who considerately support my literary endeavors. 
I wrote the original DVD Demystified in 1997 because I was captivated by DVD, an
extraordinary new technology that I wanted to tell everyone about. I knew almost
nothing when I started, so I began asking questions of anyone I could find who knew
more than I did. Literally hundreds of people, far too many to list, contributed to the
collection of know-how that I synthesized and disseminated over the years. I’m grat-
ified that, three editions later, DVD Demystified is still useful as a guide and reference
for those who are just crossing the threshold of DVD as well as those who are ven-
turing deeper into the maze of twisty passages.
I hope this new book is also useful for anyone eager to learn more about Blu-ray
Disc technology. Once again I am obliged to many people who have taken time to
explain many things. The art of optical media, interactivity, and digital video and
audio progressed immensely in the decade after DVD debuted. Descriptions of Blu-
ray often come out sounding like a portrayal of a medieval ruler: rich, powerful,
renowned, inscrutable, versatile, acclaimed, byzantine, stimulating, dominating. But
Blu-ray genuinely is a world-changing innovation — it will reign for decades as the
flag-bearer of highest quality home entertainment. If this book benefits anyone who
wants to take advantage of this important medium then my time writing it will have
been well spent.
As always, my deep thanks to Steve Chapman at McGraw-Hill for putting up with
far more than anyone should ever have to. And to my congenial colleague, Andy
Parsons, who always manages to start things off with an astute and thoughtful fore-
word. I express my gratitude and my apologies to my wife and children, who allowed
me to hole up for days on end when deadlines loomed, and came, and passed, and
were finally met. And thanks to Fleischman and Arthur, who, as always, have been
solidly supportive.

Blu-ray Disc Demystified
Introduction
About Blu-ray Disc™
We have entered the third age of digital optical disc technology, or fourth age if you
start with analog laserdisc. Laserdisc led to CD which led to DVD which led to Blu-ray
Disc (BD). Milestones along the way include the transition from analog to digital
(laserdisc to CD), stereo audio to video plus multichannel audio (CD to DVD), and stan-
dard definition to high definition (DVD to BD). Storage capacity leapt from 650
megabytes (a little more than half a gigabyte) on CD to 50 gigabytes on dual-layer BD
(and more, if three, four, or more-layer BD experiments ever escape from the laborato-
ry).
DVD is commonly put on a pedestal as the most successful consumer electronics prod-
uct of all time. It has clearly changed the way many of us watch movies at home, adding
menus, commentaries, widescreen video, multichannel audio, and more. DVD was a sea
change from analog videotapes, a hugely compelling improvement that led to over one
billion DVD playback devices finding their way into homes, automobiles, and offices in
ten swift years.
Although the triumph of DVD set very high expectations for BD as a successor format,
BD isn’t a similar quantum leap, so it will never achieve the same world-altering success.
However, the shift to high-definition video is inevitable, and BD will undoubtedly be
along for the ride.
Many people will require a working knowledge of BD, including its capabilities,
strengths, and limitations. This book provides a significant amount of this knowledge.
DVD, and now BD, affects a remarkably diverse range of fields. Advances in the arts and
technologies of film and video, combined with breakthroughs in recording, display, and
interactivity, have vaulted shiny discs into a leading role in a broad spectrum of uses. A
few are illustrated in the following pages. 
Movies, Television Shows, and More
High-definition video moves the home entertainment experience closer to the theater
experience. According to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), by the end of
2007 approximately 50 million HDTV sets had been sold to consumers in the U.S. alone
since the format debuted in 1998. 
Music and Audio
Because audio CD is well established and satisfies the needs of most music listeners,
DVD and BD have less of an effect in this area. Unlike DVD, BD has the capacity to eas-
I - 1

ily hold uncompressed or losslessly compressed multichannel audio tracks. DVD-Audio
and SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc) never achieved mainstream success, and the
audio-only playback features of BD were wisely rolled back into the video format.  DVD-
Audio and SACD appealed to music labels because they included content protection fea-
tures that CD never had. The same is provided by AACS for BD, but BD will never
become a dominant music distribution medium, especially in the face of Internet music
distribution medium.
BD is a boon for audio books and other spoken-word programs. Literally hundreds of
hours of stereo audio can be stored on a single disc — a disc that is cheaper to produce
and more convenient to use than cassette tapes or multi-CD sets.
Music Performance Video 
Music performance video was one of the most successful categories for DVD, and
should prove equally popular for BD. With high-definition, long-playing video and mul-
tichannel surround sound, BD music video appeals to a range of fans from opera to bal-
let to New Age to acid rock. Music albums on BD can improve their fan appeal by adding
such tidbits as live performances, interviews, backstage footage, outtakes, video liner
notes, musician biographies, and documentaries. And of course BD players can still play
existing CD audio discs and DVD music discs.
Training and Special Interest 
Until it is eventually replaced by video delivered over broadband Internet, DVD has
become the medium of choice for video training. The low cost of hardware and discs, the
widespread use of players, the availability of authoring systems, and a profusion of knowl-
edgeable DVD developers and producers made DVD - in both DVD-Video and multi-
media DVD-ROM form - ideal for industrial training, teacher training, sales presenta-
tions, home education, and any other application where full video and audio are needed
for effective instruction.
Videos for teaching skills from accounting to TV repair to dental hygiene, from tai chi
to guitar playing to flower arranging become vastly more effective when they take advan-
tage of the on-screen menus, detailed images, multiple soundtracks, selectable subtitles,
and other advanced interactive features. Consider an exercise video that randomly selects
different routines each day or lets you choose the mood, the tempo, and the muscle
groups on which to focus. Or a first-aid training course that slowly increases the difficul-
ty level of the lessons and the complexity of the practice sessions. Or an auto-mechanic
training video that allows you to view a procedure from different angles at the touch of a
remote control (preferably one with a grease-proof cover). Or a cookbook that helps you
select recipes via menus and indexes and then demonstrates with a skilled chef leading
you through every step of the preparation. All this on a small disc that never wears out
and never has to be rewound or fast-forwarded. 
Discs are cheaper and easier to produce, store, and distribute than videotape. Earlier
products such as laserdisc, CD-i, and Video CD did well in training applications, but they

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

required expensive or specialized players. Given the widespread availability of DVD play-
ers, many training titles will continue to be created on DVD, but BD is the perfect solu-
tion for applications that require high-definition video or advanced interactivity.
Education 
Filmstrips, 16-mm films, VHS tapes, laserdiscs, CD-i discs, Video CDs, CD-ROMs,
and the Internet have all had roles in providing images and sound to supplement text-
books and teachers. But those technologies lacked the picture quality and clarity that is
so important for classroom presentations. The unprecedented image detail, high storage
capacity, and low cost of BD make it an excellent candidate for use in classrooms, espe-
cially since it integrates well with computers. Although BD players are not widely adopt-
ed in education, computers with BD-ROM drives will become more commonplace in the
classroom. CD-ROM infiltrated all levels of schooling from home to kindergarten to col-
lege and then passed the baton to DVD as new computers with built-in DVD-ROM dri-
ves were purchased. The same will happen with BD as educational publishers discover
how to make the most of the format, creating truly interactive applications with the sen-
sory impact and realism needed to stimulate and inspire inquisitive minds.
Computer Software 
The Internet is supplanting CD-ROM and DVD-ROM as the computer software dis-
tribution medium of choice. Still, multi-gigabyte applications that would take days or
weeks to download can be distributed quickly and efficiently on DVD-ROM or BD-
ROM. These include large application suites, clip art collections, software libraries con-
taining dozens of programs that can be unlocked by paying a fee and receiving a special
code, specialized databases with hundreds of millions of entries, and massive software
products such as network operating systems and document collections. 
Video Games 
The capacity to add high-quality, real-life video and full surround sound to three-
dimensional game graphics has proven to be highly attractive to video game manufactur-
ers. A combination video game/CD/DVD/BD player is quite appealing. Sony pushed the
envelope with BD drives in the PlayStation 3 console, putting over 9 million devices into
the worldwide marketplace by the Spring of 2008.
Information Publishing 
The Internet is a wonderfully effective and efficient medium for information publish-
ing, but it currently lacks the bandwidth needed to do justice to large amounts of data rich
with graphics, audio, and motion video. BD, with storage capacity far surpassing CD and
DVD, high-definition video, and the power of Java programming, is perfect for publish-
Introduction

ing and distributing information in our ever more knowledge-intensive and information-
hungry world.
Organizations can use BD to quickly and easily disseminate reports, training material,
manuals, detailed reference handbooks, document archives, and much more. Portable
document formats such as Adobe Acrobat and HTML are perfectly suited to publishing
text and pictures on BD. Recordable BD is available for custom publishing of discs cre-
ated on the desktop. 
Marketing and Communications 
BD is well suited for carrying information from businesses to their customers and from
businesses to businesses. A BD can hold an exhaustive catalog that elaborates on each
product with full-color illustrations, video clips, demonstrations, customer testimonials,
and more, at a fraction of the cost of printed catalogs.
About This Book 
BD Demystified is an introduction and reference for anyone who wants to understand
Blu-ray Disc. It is not a production guide, nor is it a detailed technical handbook1, but it
does provide an extensive technical grounding for anyone interested in BD technology.
This book borrows a few elements from previous publications — DVD Demystified, DVD
Demystified Second Edition, and DVD Demystified Third Edition. This book can be con-
sidered as the “fourth edition” in the DVD Demystified family, but we gave it a new title
to match the winner of the next-generation format war. This book is divided into sections,
which are subdivided into chapters.
Section I - History and Background 
Chapter 1, “The Development of Blu-ray Disc,” provides historical context and back-
ground, and describes the growing pains of BD as it evolved from DVD. Any top analyst
or business leader will tell you that extrapolating from prior technologies is the best way
to predict technology trends. This chapter takes a historical stroll through the develop-
ments leading up to the introduction of BD. 
Section II - Fundamentals and Features 
Chapter 2, “Technology Primer,” explains concepts such as aspect ratios, digital com-
pression, progressive scan, and describes associated display and signal technologies. This
chapter is a gentle technical introduction for nontechnical readers, and it will be useful
for technical readers as well.

Programming HD-DVD and Blu-ray Disc, for more technical details of next generation optical disc produc-
tion, compression, and authoring.

Chapter 3, “Features,” covers the basic features of the BD video formats. In addition
to feature details, topics such as interoperability, network capabilities, and programma-
bility are discussed in this chapter. 
Chapter 4, “Content Protection, Licensing, and Patents,” details the mechanisms that
have been developed to protect the assets of the content owner. This chapter covers
AACS, BD+, region playback control, watermarking, managed recording, and managed
copying, as well as transmission protection technologies such as DTCP and HDCP. It also
attempts to make sense of the dozens of format and patent licenses that are necessary for
BD product makers.
Section III - Formats 
Chapter 5, “Physical Disc Formats,” breaks down the physical characteristics of blue-
laser optical disc technologies, from the mechanics to the data handling attributes. 
Chapter 6, “Application Details,” reveals the particulars of the video and audio speci-
fications. It lays out the data structures, stream composition, navigation information, and
other elements of the application formats.
Section IV - Implementation 
Chapter 7, “Players,” provides information on BD players and their connections. 
Chapter 8, “Myths,” does a reality check on the myths and the misunderstood charac-
teristics of BD. Be careful what you believe. 
Chapter 9, “What’s Wrong with Blu-ray Disc,” explores the shortcomings of the for-
mat and how to deal with them. 
Section V - Uses 
Chapter 10, “Interactivity,” investigates what happens when you add the power of Java
programming and Internet-style multimedia with multiple video planes, mixable audio
streams, downloadable content, and flexible user settings. 
Chapter 11, “Use in Business and Education,” helps you decide what disc flavor is
right for you. This chapter explains how BD can be integrated in the home, in the work-
place, and in training, teaching, and learning situations.
Chapter 12, “Production Essentials,” dips into the most important mysteries of pro-
ducing content for BD. This chapter provides a thorough grounding for anyone interest-
ed in creating discs or simply learning more about how the creation process works. 
Section VI - The Future 
Chapter 13, “Blu-ray and Beyond,” is a peek into the crystal ball to see what possibil-
ities lie ahead for BD and the world of digital video. Keep your arms in the vehicle at all
times.

Appendixes and Glossary 
Appendixes provide information about the disc accompanying this book and provide
reference details on the data and standards for the optical disc formats. 
A glossary of esoteric, arcane, and mundane words and terms is provided to aid those
who know they saw a word somewhere but cannot remember what it means or where they
saw it.
Units and Notation 
BD is yet another casualty of an unfortunate collision between the conventions of com-
puter storage measurement and the norms of data communications measurement. The
SI1 abbreviations of k (thousands), M (millions), and G (billions) usually take on slightly
different meanings when applied to bytes, in which case they are based on powers of 2
instead of powers of 10 (see Table I.1). 
The problem is that there is no universal standard for unambiguous use of these pre-
fixes. One person’s 50 GBs is another person’s 46.57 Gbytes and one person’s 6 MB/s is
another’s 5.72 Mbytes/s. Can you tell which is which?2
The laziness of many engineers who mix notations such as KB/s, kb/s, and kbps with no
clear distinction and no definition compounds the problem. And since divisions of 1000
look bigger than divisions of 1024, marketing mavens are much happier telling you that a
dual-layer BD holds 50 gigabytes rather than a mere 46.57 gigabytes. It may seem trivial,
but at larger denominations the difference between the two usages — and the resulting

250 GB is the typical data capacity given for a dual layer BD – fifty billion bytes, measured in magnitudes
of 1000. The 46.57 Gbyte value is the true data capacity of BD, measured using the computing method in
magnitudes of 1024. The 6 MB/s value is the 48 Mbps BD reference data transfer rate in thousands of
bytes per second. The 5.72 Mbytes/s value is the rate measured in computer units of 1024 bytes per sec-

mega level and more than a seven percent difference at the giga level. If you are planning
to produce a Blu-ray Disc and you take pains to make sure your data takes up just under
25 gigabytes, you will be surprised and annoyed to discover that only 23.28 gigabytes fit
on the disc. Things will get worse down the road with a ten percent difference at the tera
level.

measurement values in decimal and in binary computation.
Because computer memory and data storage usually are measured in megabytes and
gigabytes (as opposed to millions of bytes and billions of bytes), this book uses 1024 as the
basis for measurements of data size and data capacity, with abbreviations of KB, MB, and
GB. However, since these abbreviations have become so ambiguous, the term is spelled
out when practical. In cases where it is necessary to be consistent with published numbers
based on the alternative usage, the words thousand, million, and billion are used, or the
abbreviations k bytes, M bytes, and G bytes are used (note the small k and the spaces). 
To distinguish kilobytes (1024 bytes) from other units such as kilometers (1000 meters),
common practice is to use a large K for binary multiples. Unfortunately, other abbrevia-
tions such as M (mega) and m (micro) are already differentiated by case, so the conven-
tion cannot be applied uniformly to binary data storage. And in any case, too few people
pay attention to these nuances. 
In 1999, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) produced new prefixes
for binary multiples3 (see Table I.1). Although the new prefixes have not caught on, they
are a valiant effort to solve the problem. The main strike against them is that they sound
a bit silly. For example, the prefix for the new term gigabinary is gibi, so a BD-25 can be
said to hold 23.28 gibibytes, or GiB. The prefix for kilobinary is kibi, and the prefix for
terabinary is tebi, yielding kibibytes and tebibytes. Jokes about “kibbles and bits” and
“teletebis” are inevitable.
As if all this were not complicated enough, data transfer rates, when measured in bits
per second, are almost always multiples of 1000, but when measured in bytes per second

are sometimes multiples of 1000 and sometimes multiples of 1024. For example, a 1X BD
drive transfers data at 48 million bits per second (Mbps), which might be listed as 6 mil-
lion bytes per second or might be listed as 5.722 megabytes per second. A 1X DVD drive
transfers data at 11.08 million bits per second (Mbps), which might be listed as 1.385 mil-
lion bytes per second or might be listed as 1.321 megabytes per second. The 150 KB/s 1X
data rate commonly listed for CD-ROM drives is “true” kilobytes per second, equivalent
to 153.6 thousand bytes per second.
This book uses 1024 as the basis for measurements of byte rates (computer data being
transferred from a storage device such as a hard drive or DVD-ROM drive into comput-
er memory), with notations of KB/s and MB/s. For generic data transmission, generally
measured in thousands and millions of bits per second, this book uses 1000 as the basis
for bitrates, with notations of kbps and Mbps (note the small k) (See Table I.3).
Keep in mind that when translating from bits to bytes, there is a factor of 8, and when
converting from bitrates to data capacities in bytes, there is an additional factor of
1000/1024.

Other Conventions
Spelling 
The word disc, in reference to optical discs, should be spelled with a c, not a k. The gen-
erally accepted rule is that optical discs are spelled with a c, whereas magnetic disks are
spelled with a k. For magneto-optical discs, which are a combination of both formats, the
word is spelled with c because the discs are read with a laser. The New York Times, after
years of head-in-the-sand usage of k for all forms of data storage, revised its manual in
1999 to conform to industry practice. Standards bodies such as ECMA and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) persist in spelling it wrong, but
what can you expect from bureaucracies? Anyone writing about DVD who spells it “disk”
instead of “disc” immediately puts the reader on notice that the author is clueless. 
PC
The term PC means “personal computer.” If a distinction is needed as to the specific
type of hardware or operating system, brand names such as Windows, Mac OS, and Linux
are added.
Player
The term “player” used in a general sense refers to standalone players, game consoles,
and software playback applications.
Title
The word title fulfills two primary roles in optical disc parlance. In a general sense, title
may be used to indicate the entire contents of a disc, as in, the disc accompanying this
book is a BD title. In a specific sense, title is the highest-level unit of a BD disc, and a sin-
gle disc may contain up to 1,001 titles.
Aspect Ratios
This book usually normalizes aspect ratios to a denominator of 1, with the 1 omitted
most of the time. For example, the aspect ratio 16:9, which is equivalent to 1.78:1, is rep-
resented simply as 1.78. Normalized ratios such as 1.33, 1.78, and 1.85 are easier to com-
pare than unreduced ratios such as 4:3 and 16:9. Note also that the ratio symbol (:) is used
to indicate a relationship between width and height rather than the dimension symbol
(×), which implies a size.
Widescreen 
When the term widescreen is used in this book, it generally means an aspect ratio of
1.78 (16:9). The term widescreen, as traditionally applied to movies, has meant anything
wider than the standard 1.33 (4:3) television aspect ratio, from 1.5 to 2.7. Since the 1.78
ratio has been chosen for DVD, BD, digital television, and widescreen TVs, it has become
the commonly implied ratio of the term widescreen.

Disc Format Names 
The term BD is often applied both to the BD family as a whole and specifically to the
HDMV and BD-J video application formats, which together are often called BDMV. This
book follows the same convention for simplicity and readability but only when unam-
biguous.
When a clear distinction is needed, this book uses precise terms, such as, BD-ROM for
replicated (pre-recorded) discs; HDMV, BD-J (BD-Java), or BDAV for application for-
mats; and BD-R or BD-RE for write-once and rewritable formats, respectively.
HD
The initialism HD can refer to both high definition and high density. This book gener-
ally uses HD for high definition, which should be clear from the context.
Television Systems 
There are basically two mutually incompatible standard-definition television recording
systems in common use around the world. One system uses 525 lines scanned at 60 fields
per second with NTSC color encoding and is used primarily in Japan and North America.
The other system uses 625 lines scanned at 50 fields per second with PAL or SECAM
color encoding and is used in most of the rest of the world. This book generally uses the
technically correct terms of 525/60 (simplified from 525/59.94), and 625/50, but also uses
the terms NTSC and PAL in the generic sense.
When the world moved to high-definition the number of scan lines were standardized
at 720 and 1080, but there are still two common frame rates of 50 Hz and 60Hz that vary
among regions. In addition, the “film” frame rate of 24 Hz has become common for both
encoding and display. This book uses terms 720p and 1080p to refer to progressive-scan
picture formats regardless of frame rate, and 1080i to refer to the interlaced variation.
Terms such as 720/30p, 1080/24p, and 1080/30i are used when more precision is needed.
The number after the slash is always the frame rate, not the field rate, to avoid confusion
caused by sloppy notation such as 60i or 50i that all careful writers should eschew.
Colorspaces
BD uses three standards for video — for high-definition video, ITU-R BT.709 compo-
nent digital video 4:2:0 colorspace, and for standard-definition video, ITU-R BT.601 com-
ponent digital video 4:2:0 colorspace. BD allows for the JPEG background plane to be
either Y’CbCr 4:2:0 or Y’CbCr 4:2:2 colorspace. The Java graphics plane uses the RGBA
colorspace.
Some BD video playback systems include analog component video output in Y’PbPr
format, which is also correctly called Y’/B’-Y’/R’-Y’. Digital component output is cor-
rectly called Y’CbCr, although it’s often referred to as HDMI or DVI, the digital connec-
tion format. When a technical distinction is not critical or is clear from the context, this
book uses the general term YUV to refer to the component video signals in nonlinear
color-difference format. This book also uses the general term RGB to refer to nonlinear
R’G’B’ video.

Chapter 1
The Development of
Blu-ray Disc™
A Brief History of Storage Technology
In 1801, Joseph-Marie Jacquard devised an ingenious method for weaving complex pat-
terns using a loom controlled by punched metal cards. The same idea was borrowed over 30
years later by Charles Babbage as the program storage device for his mechanical computer,
the Analytical Engine.1 Ninety years after Jacquard, Herman Hollerith used a similar system
of punched cards for tabulating the US Census, after getting the idea from watching a train
conductor punch tickets. Fifty years later, the first electronic computers of the 1940s also
employed punched cards and punched tape — using the difference between a surface and a
hole to store information. The same concept is used in modern optical storage technology.
Viewed through an electron microscope, the pits and lands of a DVD or Blu-ray Disc would
be immediately recognizable to Jacquard or Hollerith (see Figure 1.1). However, the immen-
sity and variety of information stored on these miniature pockmarked landscapes would truly
amaze them. Hollerith’s cards held only 80 characters of information and were read at a
glacial few per second.2
Another essential method of data storage — magnetic media — was developed for the
UNIVAC I in 1951. Magnetic tape improved on the storage density of cards and paper tape
by a factor of about 50 and could be read significantly faster. Magnetic disks and drums
appeared a few years later and improved on magnetic tape, but cards and punched tape were
still much cheaper and remained the primary form of data input until the late 1970s. IBM

1Unlike Jacquard, whose system enjoyed widespread success, Babbage seemed incapable of finishing any-
thing he started. He never completed any of his mechanical calculating devices, although his designs were
later proven correct when they were turned into functioning models by other builders.
2Modern card readers of the 1970s still used only 72 to 80 characters per card but could scan over a thou-
sand cards per second.
Figure 1.1  Punched Card and Optical Disc

introduced 8-inch flexible floppy disks in 1971. These gave way to smaller 5.25-inch disks in
1976 and, finally, in 1983, 3.5-inch diskettes small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. Each suc-
cessive version held two or three times more data than its predecessor despite being smaller.
Magnetic tape was adapted for video in 1951 by Bing Crosby Enterprises. Videotape
recording was first used only by professional television studios, but a new era for home video
was ushered in when Philips and Sony produced black-and-white, reel-to-reel videotape
recorders in 1965. However, at $3,000 (the equivalent of about $19,000 in 2007) they did not
grace many living rooms. Sony’s professional 3/4-inch U-matic videocassette tape appeared
in 1972, the same year as the video game Pong. More affordable color video recording
reached home consumers in 1975 when Sony introduced the Betamax videotape recorder.
The following year JVC introduced VHS (Video Home System)3, which was slightly inferior
to Betamax but won the battle of the VCRs by virtue of longer recording time, lower costs,
and extensive licensing agreements with equipment manufacturers and video distributors.
The first Betamax VCR cost $2,300 ($8,800 in 2007 dollars), and a 1-hour blank tape cost $16
(about $60 at today’s value). The first VHS deck was cheaper at $885 (over $3,200 today),
and Sony quickly introduced a new Betamax model for $1300, but both systems were out of
the financial reach of most consumers for the first few years.
MCA/Universal and Disney studios sued Sony in 1976 in an attempt to prevent home
copying with VCRs. Eight years later, the courts upheld consumer recording rights by declar-
ing Sony the winner. Established content owners, such as record labels and motion picture
studios, have fought a similar battle with each new introduction of recording technology,
going back to player pianos and extending to MP3, DVD, and Blu-ray, as they try to control
the technology and influence the law.
In 1978, Philips and Pioneer introduced videodiscs, which actually had been first devel-
oped in rudimentary form in 1928 by John Logie Baird.4 The technology had improved in 50
years, replacing wax discs with polymer discs and delivering an exceptional analog color pic-
ture by using a laser to read information from the disc. The technology got a big boost from
General Motors, which bought 11,000 players in 1979 to use for demonstrating cars.
Videodisc systems became available to the home market in 1979 when MCA joined the
laserdisc camp with its DiscoVision brand. A second videodisc technology, called capacitance
electronic disc (CED), introduced just over two years later by RCA, used a diamond stylus
that came in direct contact with the disc — as with a vinyl record. CED went by the brand
name SelectaVision and was more successful initially, but eventually failed because of its
technical flaws. CED was abandoned in 1984 after fewer than 750,000 units were sold, leav-
ing laserdisc to overcome the resulting stigma. JVC and Panasonic (Matsushita) developed a
similar technology called video high density or video home disc (VHD), which used a groove-

3It is sometimes claimed that VHS originally stood for vertical helical scan and was later changed to a more
consumer-friendly expansion. The backronyms Victor Home System and Victor helical scan are also occa-
sionally seen.
4Baird was a brilliant inventor who made major contributions to the development of television. He used stan-
dard gramophone music recording equipment to record a 30-line video signal from a Nipkow disc. In the early
1980’s, Donald McLean was able to digitize, process, and recover the video from Baird’s surviving
Phonovision discs, making it possible to see the very first television recordings with remarkable clarity.

less disc that was read by a floating stylus. VHD limped along for years in Japan and was mar-
keted briefly by Thorn EMI in Great Britain, but it never achieved significant success. 
For years, laserdisc was the Mark Twain of video technology, with many exaggerated
reports of its demise as customers and the media confused it with the defunct CED. Adding
to the confusion was the addition of digital audio to laserdisc, which in countries using the
PAL television system required the re-launch of a new, incompatible version. Laserdisc per-
severed, but because of its lack of recording, the high price of discs and players, and the
inability to show a movie without breaks (a laserdisc cannot hold more than one hour per
side), it was never more than a niche success, catering to videophiles and penetrating less
than 2 percent of the consumer market in most countries. In some Asian countries, laserdisc
achieved as much as 50 percent penetration, almost entirely because of its karaoke features. 
Despite the exceptional picture quality of both laserdisc and CED, they were quickly over-
whelmed by the eruption of VHS VCRs in the late 1970s, which started out at twice the price
of laserdisc players but soon dropped below them. The first video rental store in the United
States opened in 1977, and the number grew rapidly to 27,000 in the late 1990s. Direct sales
of prerecorded movies to customers, known as sell-through, began in 1980. In 2008, the home
video market was a $24 billion business in the US and generated over $50 billion worldwide.
Optical media languished during the heyday of magnetic disks, never achieving commer-
cial success other than for analog video storage (i.e., laser videodiscs). It was not until the
development of the compact disc (CD) in the 1980s that optical media again proved its worth
in the world of bits and bytes, setting the stage for DVD.
Another innovation of the 1980s was erasable optical media based on magneto-optical
(MO) technology. Magneto-optical discs use a laser to heat a polyphase crystalline material
that can then be aligned by a magnetic field. Features of MO technology were later adapted
for recordable DVD and BD.
In the late 1980s, a new video recording format based on 8-mm tape with metal particles
was introduced. The reduced size and improved quality were not sufficient to displace the
well-established VHS format, but 8-mm and Hi8 tapes were quite successful in the cam-
corder market, where smaller size is more significant. 8mm tape was later adapted by Sony
to store digital video in the DV format.
Around this time, minor improvements were made to television, with stereo sound added
in the United States in 1985 and, later, closed captions.
In 1987, JVC introduced an improved “super VHS” system called S-VHS. Despite being
compatible with VHS and almost doubling the picture quality, S-VHS was never much of a
success because there were too many barriers to customer acceptance. Oddly, S-VHS fore-
shadowed very similar problems that DVD-Audio would encounter a decade later. Players
and tapes were much more expensive, and VHS tapes worked in S-VHS players but not vice
versa. A special s-video cable and an expensive TV with an s-video connector were required
to take advantage of the improved picture, and S-VHS was not a step toward high-definition
television (HDTV), which was receiving lavish attention in the late 1980s and was expected
to appear shortly. The major contribution of S-VHS to the industry was the popularization
of the s-video connector, which carried better-quality signals than the standard composite
format. S-video connectors are still mistakenly referred to as S-VHS connectors.

TV’s Digital Face-Lift
As television began to show its age, new treatments appeared in an attempt to remove the
wrinkles. European broadcasters rolled out PALplus in 1994 as a stab at enhanced-definition
television (EDTV) that maintained compatibility with existing receivers and transmitters.
PALplus achieved a widescreen picture by using a letterboxed5 image for display on conven-
tional TVs and hiding helper lines in the black bars so that a widescreen PALplus TV could
display the full picture with extended vertical resolution.
Other ways of giving television a face-lift included improved-definition televisions (IDTV)
that doubled the picture display rate or used digital signal processing to remove noise and to
improve picture clarity.
None of these measures were more than stopgaps while we waited for the old workhorse
to be replaced by high-definition television. HDTV was first demonstrated in the United
States in 1981, and the process of revamping the “boob tube” reached critical mass in 1987
when 58 broadcasting organizations and companies filed a petition with the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) to explore advanced television technologies. The Advanced
Television Systems Committee (ATSC) was formed and began creeping toward consensus as
25 proposed systems were evaluated extensively and either combined or eliminated.
In Japan, a similar process was underway that was unfettered by red tape. An HDTV sys-
tem called HiVision, based on MUSE compression, was developed quickly and put into use
in 1991.6 Ironically, the rapid deployment of the Japanese system was its downfall. The
MUSE system was based on the affordable analog transmission technology of its day, but
soon the cost of digital technology plummeted at the same time as its capability skyrocketed.
Back on the other side of the Pacific, the lethargic US HDTV standards creation process was
still in motion as video technology graduated from analog to digital. In 1993, the ATSC rec-
ommended that the new television system be digital. The Japanese government and the
Japanese consumer electronics companies — which would be making most of the high-defi-
nition television sets for use in the United States — decided to wait for the American digital
television standard and adopt it for use in Japan, as well. A happy by-product of HiVision is
that the technology-loving early Japanese adopters served as guinea pigs, supporting the
development of high-resolution widescreen technology and paving the way for HDTV else-
where. A European HDTV system, HD-MAC, which combined widescreen analog video with
digital audio, was even more short-lived; it was demonstrated at the 1992 Albertville
Olympics but was abandoned shortly thereafter.
Discussions had begun in Europe around creating a digital television format, which lead
to the launch of the DVB (Digital Video Broadcast) Project in 1993. It became clear that the
satellite and cable industries would be able to bring digital television to market before the
terrestrial broadcast industries, which led to the development and launch of DVB-S in 1995,
followed quickly by DVB-C, and finally by DVB-T in 1998.

5Letterboxing is the technique of preserving a wide picture on a less wide display by covering the gap at the
top and bottom with black bars. Aspect ratios and letterboxing are covered in Chapter 2.
6The HiVision system used 1125 video scan lines. In the charmingly quirky style of Japanese marketing,
HiVision was introduced on November 25 so that the date (11/25) corresponded with the number of scan
lines.

The ATSC made its proposal for a digital television standard to the US FCC in November
1995, and it was approved at the end of 1996. HDTV, originally promised for the early 1990s,
finally concluded its long gestation period in December 1998, only to begin an even longer
battle for ascendancy.
During the gestation of HDTV, numerous formats were developed to store video digitally
and convert it to a standard analog television signal for display. The elephantine size of video
is a problem. Uncompressed standard-definition digital television video requires at least 124
million bits per second (Mbps).7 Obviously, some form of compression is needed. Many pro-
prietary and incompatible systems were developed, including Intel’s DVI in 1988 (which had
been developed earlier by the Sarnoff Institute). That same year, the Moving Picture Experts
Group (MPEG) committee was created by Leonardo Chairiglione and Hiroshi Yasuda with
the intent to standardize video and audio for CDs. In 1992, the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted the
standard known as MPEG-1. Audio and video encoded by this method could be squeezed to
fit the limited data rate of the single-speed CD format. The notorious MP3 format is a nick-
name for MPEG-1 Layer III audio.
The MPEG committee extended and improved its system to handle high-quality
audio/video at higher data rates. MPEG-2 was adopted as an international standard in 1994
and is used by many digital video systems, including DVB and the ATSC’s DTV. An updat-
ed version of Video CD, called Super Video CD, used MPEG-2 for better quality. MPEG-2
is also the basis of DVD-Video, augmented with the Dolby Digital (AC-3) multichannel
audio system, developed as part of the original work of the ATSC.
The CD Revolution
Sony and Philips had reinvigorated optical storage technology when they introduced
Compact Disc Digital Audio in 1982. This was known as the “Red Book standard” because of
the red cover on the book of technical specifications. The first CD players cost around $1,000
(over $2,000 in 2007 dollars).
Three years later, a variation for storing digital computer data — CD-ROM — was intro-
duced in a book with yellow covers. As CD-ROM entered the mainstream, original limita-
tions such as slow data rates and glacial access times were overcome with higher spin rates,
bigger buffers, and improved hardware. CD-ROM became the preeminent instrument of
multimedia and the standard for delivery of software and data.
After introducing CD-ROM, Sony and Philips continued to refine and expand the CD
family. In 1986, they produced Compact Disc Interactive (CD-i, the “Green Book standard”),
intended to become the new system for interactive home entertainment. CD-i incorporated
specialized file formats and custom hardware with the OS-9 operating system running on the
Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Unfortunately, CD-i was obsolete before it was finished,

7124 Mbps is the data rate of active video at ITU-R BT.601 4:2:0 sampling with 8 bits, which provides an aver-
age of 12 bits per pixel (720×480×30×12 or 720×576×25×12). The commonly seen 270 Mbps fig-ure
comes from studio-format video that uses 4:2:2 sampling at 10 bits and includes blanking intervals. At higher
4:4:4 10-bit sampling, the data rate is 405 Mbps.

and the few supporting companies dropped out early, leaving Philips to stubbornly champi-
on it alone before finally giving up in the mid 1990s.
The “Orange Book standard” was developed in 1990 to support magneto-optical (MO)
and write-once (WO) technology. MO had the advantage of being rewritable but was incom-
patible with standard CD drives and remained expensive. CD-WO was superseded by
“Orange Book Part II,” recordable CD (CD-R). Recordable technology revolutionized CD-
ROM production by enabling developers to create fully functional CDs for testing and sub-
mission to disc replicators. As prices dropped, CD-R became widely popular for business and
personal archiving.
MPEG-1 video from a CD was demonstrated by Philips and Sony on their CD-i system in
1991. The CD-i MPEG-1 Digital Video format was used as the basis for Karaoke CD, which
became Video CD, a precursor to DVD. About 50 movies were released in CD-i Digital
Video format before a standardized version appeared as Video CD (VCD) in 1993, based on
proposals by JVC, Sony, and Philips and documented as the “White Book specification.” Not
to be confused with CD-Video (CDV), Video CD used MPEG-1 compression to store 74
minutes of near-VHS-quality audio and video on a CD-ROM XA bridge disc.8 Video CD 2.0
was finalized in 1994. Video CD did quite well in markets where VCRs were not already
established, but Video CD never fared as well in Europe, and almost qualified as an endan-
gered species in the United States.
Erasable CD, part III of the “Orange Book standard,” did not appear until 1997. The stan-
dard was finalized in late 1996, and the official name of Compact Disc Rewritable (CD-RW)
was chosen in hopes of avoiding the disturbing connotations of “erasable.” Around 1999, the
prices of CD-R/RW drives and blank CD-R discs dipped enough to provoke their wide-
spread use for recording custom music CDs. This, plus the proliferation of MP3 music files
across the Internet, drove a worldwide demand for 1.3 billion CD-Rs in 1999, with an esti-
mated 30 to 40 percent being used for music.
The Long Gestation of DVD 
Shortly after the introduction of CDs and CD-ROMs, prototypes of their eventual
replacement began to be developed. Systems using blue lasers achieved four times the stor-
age capacity, but were based on large, expensive gas lasers because cheap semiconductor
lasers at that wavelength were not available. In 1993, 10 years after the worldwide introduc-
tion of CDs, the first next-generation prototypes neared realization. Some of these first
attempts simply used CD technology with smaller pits to create discs that could hold twice as
much data. Although this far exceeded original CD tolerances, the optics of most drives were
good enough to read the discs, and it was possible to connect the digital output of a CD play-
er to an MPEG video decoder. The reality that CD technology tended to falter when pushed
too far, however, soon became apparent. Philips reportedly put its foot down and said it

8This is actually quite amazing when you consider the difference in data bandwidth between audio and video.
VCD, using MPEG-1 compression, made it possible to store just as much video (and its accompanying audio)
on a compact disc as CD audio can store for audio alone. The difference, of course, is that VCD used data

would not allow CD patent licensees to market the technology because it could not guaran-
tee compatibility and a good user experience. When all things were considered, it seemed
better to develop a new system.
The stage was set in September 1994 by seven international entertainment and content
providers — Columbia Pictures (Sony), Disney, MCA/Universal (Panasonic), MGM/UA,
Paramount, Viacom, and Warner Bros., who called for a single worldwide standard for the
new generation of digital video on optical media. These studios formed the Hollywood
Advisory Committee and requested the following —
j Room for a full-length feature film, about 135 minutes, on one side of a single disc
j Picture quality superior to high-end consumer video systems such as laserdisc
j Compatibility with matrixed surround and other high-quality audio systems
j Ability to accommodate three to five languages on one disc
j Content protection
j Multiple aspect ratios for wide-screen support
j Multiple versions of a program on one disc, with parental lockout
Preparations and proposals commenced, but two incompatible camps soon formed. Like
antagonists in some strange mechanistic mating ritual, each side boasted of its prowess and
attempted to enlist the most backers. At stake was the billion-dollar home video industry, as
well as millions of dollars in patent licensing revenue.
1995 – The Pre-DVD Formats Duke it Out
On December 16, 1994, Sony and its partner Philips independently announced their new
format — a red laser based, single-sided, 3.7-billion-byte Multimedia CD (MMCD, renamed
from HDCD, which, it turned out, was already taken). The remaining cast of characters joint-
ly proposed a different red laser standard one month later on January 24, 1995. Their Super
Disc (SD) standard was based on a double-sided design holding five billion bytes per side.
The SD Alliance was led by seven companies — Hitachi, Panasonic (Matsushita),
Mitsubishi, Victor (JVC), Pioneer, Thomson (RCA/GE), and Toshiba (business partner of
Time Warner) — and attracted about ten other supporting companies, primarily home elec-
tronics manufacturers and movie studios. Philips and Sony assembled a rival gang of about
14 companies, largely peripheral hardware manufacturers. Neither group had support from
major computer companies. At this stage, the emphasis was on video entertainment, with
computer data storage as a subordinate goal.
Sony and Philips played up the advantages of MMCD’s single-layer technology, such as
lower manufacturing costs and CD compatibility without the need for a dual-focus laser, but
the SD Alliance was winning the crucial support of Hollywood with its dual-layer system’s
longer playing time. On February 23, 1995, Sony played catch-up by announcing a two-layer,
single-side design licensed from 3M that would hold 7.4 billion bytes.
The scuffling continued, and the increasing emphasis on data storage by consumer elec-
tronics companies began to worry the computer industry. At the end of April 1995, five com-
puter companies — Apple, Compaq, HP, IBM, and Microsoft — formed a technical working

group that met with each faction and urged them to compromise. The computer companies
flatly stated that they did “not plan to choose between these proposed new formats” and pro-
vided a list of nine objectives for a single standard —
j One format for both computers and video entertainment
j A common file system for computers and video entertainment
j Backward compatibility with existing CDs and CD-ROMs
j Forward compatibility with future writable and rewritable discs
j Costs similar to current CD media and CD-ROM drives
j No mandatory caddy or cartridge
j Data reliability equal to or better than CD-ROM
j High data capacity, extensible to future capacity enhancements
j High performance for video (sequential files) and computer data
Sony refused to budge, and one month later said there would be “no adjustment” in its
MMCD format. On August 14, 1995, the computer industry group, now up to seven mem-
bers with the addition of Fujitsu and Sun, concluded that the most recent versions of the two
formats essentially met all their requirements except the first — a single, unified standard. In
order to best support the requirements for a cross-platform file system and read/write sup-
port, the group recommended adoption of the Universal Disk Format (UDF) developed by
the Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA). Alan Bell, at IBM, reportedly told Sony
and Philips that the group intended to settle on the SD format and gave the squabbling com-
panies a few weeks to produce a compromise. Faced with the peril of no support from the
computer industry or the worse prospect of a standards war reminiscent of Betamax versus
VHS, the two camps announced at the Berlin IFA show that they would discuss the possibil-
ity of a combined standard. The companies officially entered into negotiations on August 24.
The computer companies expressed their preference that the MMCD data storage method
and dual-layer technology be combined with SD’s bonded substrates and better error-cor-
rection method.
On September 15, 1995, the SD Alliance announced that “considering the computer com-
panies’ requests to enhance reliability,” it was willing to switch to the Philips/Sony method of
bit storage despite a capacity reduction from 5 billion to 4.7 billion bytes. Sony and Philips
made a similar conciliatory announcement, and thus, almost a year after they began, the hos-
tilities officially ended. The two DVD groups continued to hammer out a consensus that
finally was announced on December 12, 1995. The combined format covered the basic DVD-
ROM physical and video elements, taking into account the recommendations made by movie
studios and the computer industry. A new alliance was formed — the DVD Consortium —
consisting of Philips and Sony, the big seven from the SD camp, and Time Warner. When all
was said and done, Panasonic held roughly 25 percent of the technology patents; Pioneer and
Sony each had 20 percent; Philips, Hitachi, and Toshiba were left with 10 percent of the pie.
Many people at Sony felt they had lost the war, since only a small part of their format was
adopted and they were left with a smaller patent position than expected. A group of engi-
neers decided to start work on a successor format with the goal of being more in the driver’s
seat. This was the birth of Blu-ray.

1996 – DVD is Born, Barely
In January 1996, companies began to announce their DVD plans for the coming year. The
road ahead looked smooth and clear until the engineers in their rose-colored glasses, riding
forecast-fueled marketing machines, crashed headlong into the protectionist paranoia of
Hollywood.
As the prospect of DVD solidified, the movie studios began to obsess about what would
happen when they released their family jewels in pristine digital format with the possibility
that people could make high-quality videotape copies or even perfect digital dubs. Rumors
began to surface that DVD would be delayed because of copyright worries. On March 29, the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA) and the Motion Picture Association
of America (MPAA) announced that they had agreed to seek legislation that would protect
intellectual property and consumers’ rights concerning digital video recorders. They hoped
their proposal would be included in the Digital Recording Act of 1996 that was about to be
introduced in the US Congress.
Their recommendations were intended to —
j allow consumers to make home video recordings from broadcast or basic cable
television, 
j allow analog or digital copies of subscription programming, with the qualifica-
tion that digital copies of the copy could be prevented, and
j allow copyright owners to prohibit copying from pay-per-view, video-on-
demand, and prerecorded material.
The two groups hailed their agreement as a landmark compromise between industries that
often had been at odds over copyright issues. They added that they welcomed input from the
computer industry, and input they got! A week later, an agitated group of 30 computer and
communications companies fired off a “list of critiques” of the technical specifications that
had been proposed by Hollywood and the consumer electronics companies. They were less
than thrilled that MPAA and CEMA had attempted to unilaterally dictate hardware and soft-
ware systems that would keep movies from being copied onto personal computers. The com-
puter industry said it preferred voluntary standards for content protection and objected to
being told exactly how to implement things. Hollywood countered that the computer indus-
try had been invited to participate early on but did not, either due to laziness or arrogance.
The news media was filled with reports of DVD being “stalled,” “embattled,” and “derailed.” 
In anticipation of the imminent release of DVD, and with content protection details still
unresolved, the MPAA and CEMA announced draft legislation called the Video Home
Recording Act (VHRA), designed to legally uphold content protection, which included the
insertion of a 2-bit identifier in the video stream to mark content as copy-prohibited. The two
groups had been working on the legislation since 1994, apparently without directly consult-
ing the computer industry, which filed a letter of protest against the proposed legislation,
requesting that an encryption and watermarking scheme be used as a technical alternative to
legislation. The content protection technology eventually became the much more complex
CSS, and the legislation mutated into the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
On June 25, Toshiba announced that the 10 companies in the consortium had agreed to
The Development of Blu-ray Disc
1

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

integrate standardized content protection circuits in their players, including a regional man-
agement system to control the distribution and release of movies in different parts of the
world. Many people understood this to mean that the content protection issue had been laid
to rest, not realizing that this content protection agreement dealt only with analog copying
by using the Macrovision signal-modification technology to prevent recording on a VCR.
The manufacturers, still clutching their dreams of DVD players under Christmas trees and
hoping to keep enthusiasm high, conveniently failed to mention that Hollywood was holding
out for digital content protection as well.
At the end of July, more than a month after a content protection settlement was to have
been made, the DVD Consortium — the hardware side of the triangle — agreed to support
a content protection method proposed by Panasonic. The Copy Protection Technical Working
Group (CPTWG), representing all three sides of the triangle, agreed to examine the propos-
al, which used content encryption to prevent movie data from being copied directly using a
DVD-ROM drive.
The big news finally arrived on October 29, 1996 — the Copy Protection Technical
Working Group announced that a tentative agreement had been reached. The modified copy
protection technology developed by Panasonic and Toshiba, called Content Scramble System
(CSS), would be licensed through a nonprofit entity, later formed and named the DVD CCA
(Copy Control Association).
Panasonic and Toshiba debuted DVD players in Japan on November 1, a dismal rainy day
with lackluster player sales and a handful of discs, mostly music videos. Warner Home Video
began sales in Japan of four major movie titles — The Assassin, Blade Runner, Eraser, and
The Fugitive — on December 20. Players from Panasonic and Pioneer finally began to appear
in the United States in February as more movies and music performance videos were
announced from Lumivision, Warner Bros. Records, and others. Eager customers bought the
players, only to discover that no titles other than those from Lumivision were scheduled to
appear before the end of March. Warner, the primary supplier, limited its release to seven
test cities.
DVD had finally embarked, late and lacking some of its early luster, on the rocky road to
acceptance.
1997 – Ups and Downs
The DVD roller coaster ride continued into the fall of 1997. Disney announced that it
would finally enter the market with DVD discs, but the planned titles did not include any of
the coveted animated features.
In October, the 10-member DVD Consortium changed its name to the DVD Forum and
opened membership to all interested companies. By the time the first DVD Forum general
meeting was held in December, the organization had grown to 120 members.
The first DVD-R drives appeared from Pioneer. In spite of the $17,000 price tag, DVD
developers, desperate for an easy way to test their titles, snapped them up. After all, com-
pared to the $150,000 price of the first CD-R recorders, DVD-R recorders were a bargain.
In November 1997, the first public breach of DVD content protection occurred. A pro-

gram called softDVDcrack was posted to the Internet, allowing digital copies of movies to be
made on computers. The press reported that CSS encryption had been cracked but, in actu-
ality, the program hacked the Zoran software DVD player to get to the decrypted, decom-
pressed video.
At the end of December 1997, 340,000 DVD players had been sold in the US. This was far
below “expectations” of 1.2 million. Dozens of reports appeared that disparaged DVD’s per-
formance. Few bothered to mention that most of the expectations had been unreasonably
optimistic.
1998 – DVD Matures
In 1998, the new Toshiba SD-7108 progressive scan DVD players, able to display almost
twice the resolution as standard players from the same DVD, did not make it out of the ware-
house. Concerns about lack of content protection on progressive scan output kept them there
for another year.
Demolishing opinions that dual-layer, double-sided discs (DVD-18s) would never be
achieved, Warner Advanced Media Operations (WAMO) announced a new process to make
them. This was immediately followed by rumors that the 195-minute Titanic would be the
first DVD-18 release, since director James Cameron was insisting that the DVD contain both
fullscreen and widescreen versions. It was no surprise that the rumors were false.
1999 – The Year of DVD
It was, by most reckonings, the year of DVD. 
The Digital Display Working Group (DDWG) announced on February 23 the completion
of the Digital Visual Interface (DVI) specification for final draft review. Studios were looking
forward to this replacement for computer VGA output, since DVI included an optional con-
tent protection mechanism.
On March 14, director John Frankenheimer hosted a live web event for owners of the
Ronin DVD. As he answered questions over the Internet, he played back hidden content
from the disc to illustrate behind-the-scenes events and to explain details of producing the
movie. Since it was impossible to stream DVD video over the Internet, the trick was to use
InterActual’s PCFriendly software to remotely control the DVD-ROM drives of the tens of
thousands of chat participants. This was one of the first attempts to extend the features of
DVD by connecting it to the Web. InterActual pioneered other interactive adaptations of
DVD, many of which were the genesis for some of the advanced interactive features in HD
DVD and Blu-ray, including BD-Live.
On July 6, 1999, Pioneer Entertainment announced its completed transition out of the
laserdisc business. After years of being the leading laserdisc supplier, Pioneer Entertainment
had shifted to DVD and VHS only, which by then accounted for more than 90 percent of the
company’s title business. Although laserdisc players were still made by Pioneer New Media
Technologies for education and industrial applications, the decision by Pioneer
Corporation’s entertainment group to abandon laserdiscs marked the end of an era.

Panasonic, hoping to create a new era of digital tape for consumers, announced again that
it would begin to sell its HD-capable D-VHS VCR.
In September 1999, The Matrix became the first DVD to sell a million copies.9 The Matrix
gained notoriety as buyers reported problems playing it on dozens of different player mod-
els. While there were some UDF filesystem errors on the disc itself, it was discovered that
some players had not been properly engineered to handle a disc that aggressively exercised
DVD features and included extra content for use on PCs. The success of The Matrix ampli-
fied the magnitude of the problem. Under pressure from disgruntled customers, manufac-
turers released firmware upgrades to correct the flaws in their players. Years later, when
these same manufacturers began working on vastly more complex Blu-ray players, the
lessons they learned from DVD upgrades led them to add an Ethernet port to many Blu-ray
player models so they could download firmware updates over the Internet.
Also in September, Toshiba shipped its progressive scan DVD player, which had been lan-
guishing in ware-houses for a year. Panasonic released its progressive scan player in October.
The true potential of DVD video quality was finally being unlocked in places other than com-
puters.
At the last minute, Sony, Philips, and HP cancelled their planned DVD+RW launch. The
DVD+RW camp had decided to retrench, abandoning the 3.0G format — which would have
been incompatible with every existing DVD-ROM drive and player — and focusing on the
improved 4.7G version that promised backward compatibility with most DVD readers.
Pioneer announced that it would release a DVD-Audio player in Japan without content
protection, since that was the only part that was unresolved. The player would only be able
to play unprotected DVD-Audio discs until it was updated with final content protection sup-
port. This turned out to be a reasonable compromise because decisions on DVD-Audio
encryption and watermarking were almost a year away.
In November and December, fallout began from a Windows-based software program
called DeCSS that had spread across the Internet in late October. The program was designed
to remove CSS encryption from discs and to copy the video files to a hard drive. DeCSS was
written by 16-year-old Jon Johansen of Norway, based on code created by a German pro-
grammer who was a member of an anonymous group called Masters of Reverse Engineering
(MoRE). The MoRE programmers reverse-engineered the CSS algorithm and discovered
that the Xing software DVD player had not encrypted the key it used to unlock protected
DVDs. Because of weak security in the CSS design, additional keys were quickly generat-ed
by computer programs that guessed at values and tried them until they worked. Johansen
claimed his intent in turning the MoRE code into an application was to be able to play
movies using the Linux operating system, which had no licensed CSS implementation.
Anyone familiar with CSS was surprised that it had taken so long for the system to be
cracked. After all, the first edition of DVD Demystified (the predecessor to this book) had pre-
dicted three years earlier that CSS would be compromised. In spite of this, frenetic press
reports portrayed a “shocked” movie industry, taken aback by the failure of the system that
was supposed to protect its assets. DVD-Audio player manufacturers announced a six-month

9It took two years for DVD to reach the first million-copy point for a title. Audio CD took four years with

delay, presumably to counter the threat of DeCSS by reworking the planned CSS2 copy pro-
tection system. Those familiar with the lack of DVD-Audio titles and the incompleteness of
CSS2 saw the announcement as a convenient excuse to delay products that would not have
been ready in any case.
2000 – The Medium of the New Millennium
On February 14, Jack Valenti, then the head of the MPAA, speaking of DeCSS and other
threats to Hollywood’s intellectual property, told Salon that, “...some obscure person sitting
in a basement can throw up on the Internet a brand new motion picture, and with the click
of a button have it go with the speed of light to 6 billion people around the world, instanta-
neously.” This led people to wonder where they could get these new ISL modems10 that 6 bil-
lion people already had.
Region coding, part of the CSS license, came under attack in London when British super-
market group Tesco wrote to Warner Home Video demanding an end to the policy.
Sony’s PlayStation 2 shipped more than 1 million units in its first 12 days, and in less than
a month doubled the number of DVD players in Japan. DVD industry analysts worldwide
quickly updated their forecasts to account for the expected impact of this new kind of DVD
player.
JVC announced a consumer version of D-VHS. The digital tape format, originally
designed only to record data, had been reworked with a standard way of recording and play-
ing back digital video, along with now requisite content protection.
In July 2000, more than three years after the introduction of DVD-Video and DVD-ROM
in the US, DVD-Audio players belatedly shipped. It was not what anyone would call a grand
coming-out. There was no marketing or PR hoopla and the players were in short supply and
hard to find.
In November, Sony announced that it was working on Ultra Density Optical (UDO), a new
blue-laser optical disc format intended to replace magneto-optical discs. In October, Sony
showed UDO at the Ceatec show in Japan and also jointly with Pioneer unveiled a sister for-
mat called DVR Blue, which eventually became first-generation Blu-ray Disc rewritable for-
mat (BD-RE).
2001 – DVD Turns Five
On October 29, 2001, the DVD format officially turned 5 years old. During this one year,
over 12.7 million DVD-Video players shipped to form an installed base of more than 26 mil-
lion players in the US alone, with over 14,000 titles to chose from.11 There were more than
45 million DVD-ROM drives in the US, with approximately 90 million installed worldwide.
And, for the first time, DVD player sales exceeded VCR sales. Not bad for a format with only
five candles on its cake!
The D-Theater format was released, which provided copy-protected high-definition movies

11This figure did not include adult video titles, which accounted for an estimated additional 15%.

at excellent quality on D-VHS tape. However, after a limited test run by Universal and oth-
ers, the format never took hold.
The next several years saw DVD flourish as sales of DVD players in the US continued to
grow to form an installed base of over 73 million players by the fall of 2003. By that time,
more than 27,000 DVD-Video titles were available, of which over 1.5 billion copies had been
shipped. Within a year, 40,000+ DVD-Video titles were available as the industry topped $22
billion. (That’s right, “billion” is the one with nine zeros after it.) By this point, home video
releases on DVD began to overtake theatrical revenue for the same titles, marking the start
of a new paradigm in the content community.
In December, the DVD Forum set up an ad-hoc group to study new, efficient HD codecs
— including Microsoft’s Corona, the code name for what became Windows Media Video 9
and VC-1 — with an eye toward fitting HD movies on dual-layer DVDs. Meanwhile, work
had been steadily progressing on next-generation optical disc technology. Unfortunately, fac-
tions were forming, and it soon became clear that there would be a repeat of the early days
of DVD, with more than one contender for the title of successor.
Format Wars, the Next Generation
On January 7, 2002, Toshiba announced its next-generation read/write optical disc tech-
nology using 405-nm blue-laser technology, able to store up to 30 Gbytes on a single side,
capacity enough to record three hours of high-definition video. Toshiba demonstrated the
technology at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, and said it
would propose the technology to the DVD Forum.
On February 19, 2002, nine companies — Hitachi, LG, Panasonic, Pioneer, Philips,
Samsung, Sharp, Sony, and Thomson Multimedia — announced that they had established
preliminary specifications for the Blu-ray Disc format, a new, high-density, rewritable disc
format with up to 50-Gbyte capacity based on solid-state blue-laser technology.
The war had begun.
Of course, blue-laser announcements did not make DVD instantly obsolete, and on
February 26 the DVD Forum voted to move ahead with a proposal from Warner Bros. and
other motion picture studios to put high-definition video on dual-layer DVD-9 discs. This
was informally dubbed HD DVD9.
Seeing a storm on its horizon, the DVD Forum (which included Toshiba and the nine Blu-
ray companies) announced in April that it would investigate next-generation standards for
high-capac-ity, blue-laser discs. Many in the industry predicted that Blu-ray would soon be
adopted by the DVD Forum and there would be a smooth road to the next-generation of
optical disc formats. Insiders quickly realized, however, that the beginning of a politically
charged conflict was being staged that would create new friends and new enemies in a fight
for the multi-billion dollar legacy from DVD.
In May, the nine Blu-ray companies announced the formation of the Blu-ray Disc Founders
group and stated that they planned to release version 1.0 of the recordable disc specifications
in June. Incredibly, in spite of the clear lesson from DVD that entertainment content could
make or break a format, the group was focused on recording technology and seemed to

ignore the behemoth industry in the hills of Los Angeles.
On June 20, 2002, Circuit City, the largest electronics retailer in the US, became the first
major VHS retailer to announce that it was eliminating VHS movies from its stores to make
room for faster-selling DVDs. 
In August, Toshiba and NEC formally proposed their blue-laser optical disc format, now
called Advanced Optical Disc (AOD), to the DVD Forum. The AOD format was twice voted
down in meetings of the DVD Forum Steering Committee, with Blu-ray supporters mostly
voting against or abstaining (which had the effect of a “no” vote). 
In November 2002, amidst charges of anti-trust behavior against the Blu-ray companies
that had blocked previous votes, the DVD Forum voting rules were changed (so that absten-
tions no longer counted) and AOD was finally approved by the DVD Forum Steering
Committee. It was later renamed to HD DVD. 
Also in November, the Chinese government announced that enhanced versatile disc
(EVD), a project that started in 1999 and experienced several cancelled launches, would be
launched by Christmas 2003. EVD had been created as an alternative to DVD in part to
decrease the flow of licensing royalties to Japan and other DVD patent holders. The plan was
for EVD to use a new optical disc format and compression technologies developed in China,
but the anticipated new technologies were too slow in coming, so the format ended up using
red-laser DVD, flirted with proprietary video compression technologies (VP5 and VP6,
developed by On2 in the US), and finally settled on MPEG-2. The EVD format supported
HD video resolutions, including 1280×720 at 60 fps progressive (720p) and 1920×1080 at
30 fps interlaced (1080i). In April 2004, another group led by Amlogic and several major
Chinese television manufacturers, announced development of the HVD format, and in May
the DVD Forum began investigating a proposal from the Industrial Research Technology
Institute (ITRI) of Taiwan for the FVD (forward versatile disc) format, intended specifically
for the low-cost Chinese market. 
In October, prototypes of both dueling blue-laser formats were unveiled at the Ceatec
exhibition in Tokyo. Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, Pioneer, and JVC showed prototype Blu-ray
Disc recorders while Toshiba showed an AOD prototype.
2003 – Blu-ray: Take One
In early 2003, at least five candidates were vying to be anointed as the new high-definition
DVD format — Blu-ray Disc, HD DVD-9 and AOD from the DVD Forum, Blue-HD-DVD-
1 and Blue-HD-DVD-2 from the Advanced Optical Storage Research Alliance (AOSRA) in
Taiwan, and WMV HD (WMV 9 files on standard DVD) from Microsoft. Of course most
bets were on Blu-ray and AOD, where the real battle lines were drawn.
In February, the Blu-ray Disc Founders group began licensing the Blu-ray Disc format. On
April 7, Sony confused a lot of BD watchers when it announced a new blue-laser Professional
Disc format for data archiving applications, which was not part of the Blu-ray format, at all.
On April 10, 2003, Sony opened the book on an entire new generation of optical technol-
ogy when it put on sale in Japan the world’s first consumer Blu-ray Disc recorder, the BDZ-
S77 at a rather steep price of ¥450,000 ($3,800 in 2003 dollars, $4,200 in 2007 dollars). The

recorder used a single-layer, 23-Gbyte BD-RE disc in a cartridge, to record about 2 hours of
high-definition MPEG-2 video direct from the built-in BS digital broadcast tuner, or 3 to 12
hours of NTSC analog video encoded internally to MPEG-2.
On May 28th, Mitsubishi Electric joined the BDF, bringing total membership to ten.
In the middle of March 2003, statistics from the Video Software Dealers Association
(VSDA) indicated that DVD had reached a major milestone in the US — rental revenue had
surpassed VHS tape. DVD sales had passed VHS sales in 2001. DVD players were now in
more than 40 million households in the US, and shipments of DVD titles had passed 700 mil-
lion units. DVD was nearing its peak just as Blu-ray began to slowly creep up from behind.
On September 12, Microsoft announced that it had submitted Windows Media Series 9 to
the Society of Motion Picture Television Engineers (SMPTE) for standardization. This was a
strategic move to distance the codec technology from Microsoft in order to get the DVD
Forum (and later the Blu-ray camp) to consider adopting it.
2004 – Blue-laser Specs and Battle Lines Are Drawn Up
Toshiba started out the year by unveiling its first prototype HD DVD player at CES in
January. The following week, Hewlett-Packard and Dell put their support behind Blu-ray
Disc.
In April, Sony pulled off a cute publicity stunt by announcing that it had worked with
Toppan Printing to make a Blu-ray disc that was 51 percent paper.
On May 18, 2004, the ten members of the Blu-ray Disc Founders group, plus HP and Dell,
announced the formation of the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) to continue development of
technical specifications and promote the format. The group welcomed other companies to
join, in a clear bid to set up a rival organization to the DVD Forum. Many companies jumped
on the bandwagon, but now had to send engineers and managers to two sets of regular tech-
nical meetings. Sun Microsystems joined immediately to stump for Java.
On June 10, the DVD Forum approved version 1.0 of the HD DVD read-only (ROM)
physical specifications.
Meanwhile, not wanting to repeat either the format delays or the content protection
breaches that had plagued DVD, an unlikely group of bedfellows from the PC, CE, and
motion-picture industries — IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Disney, and
Warner Bros. — had been working on a new content protection system to apply to upcoming
HD video recorders, and players. On July 14, 2004, they announced the formation of the
Advanced Access Content System (AACS) group. The goal was to finish the specification by
December. Old hands in the industry chuckled at the aggressive timeline, but no one had an
inkling of how long it would really take for the sometimes fiercely contentious group to pro-
duce the final documents.
At the end of July, Panasonic improved on Sony’s Blu-ray debut with the DMR-E700BD
Blu-ray recorder, which used a dual-layer 50-Gbyte BD-RE cartridge that could record 4.5
to 6 hours of HD digital satellite (BC) or terrestrial (BS) broadcast, or up to 63 hours of ana-
log NTSC video. The Panasonic model could play discs recorded on the Sony, but the Sony
could not read the 50-GByte discs. The Panasonic recorder was relatively less inexpensive at

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

$2,800 ($3,200 in 2007 dollars). The 50-Gbyte discs cost around $69 and the 25-Gbyte discs
cost around $32.
On August 11, 2004, the BDA approved version 1.0 of the physical format specifications
for the read-only (ROM) version of Blu-ray Disc so that manufacturers could begin design-
ing components. Physically, the BD-ROM format was similar to the existing BD-RE version,
but the file system and application specs for playback were being extensively reworked, and
video codec selection had yet to be determined. Players and discs were expected to be avail-
able in late 2005. 
On September 21, 2004, Sony announced that the PlayStation 3 (PS3) would use Blu-ray
Disc. This was a huge boost for the Blu-ray format and, certainly, one of the biggest factors
in its eventual success.
At the beginning of October, 20th Century Fox joined the BDA but stayed mum about
which format it would support. At the end of November, HBO, New Line Cinema,
Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros., announced support for HD DVD. With only Sony
Pictures and MGM (which was controlled by Sony) officially behind Blu-ray, the balance was
clearly tipping toward HD DVD. The significant holdout was Disney. If Disney chose HD
DVD — which many expected, since Disney had worked with Microsoft to develop the pro-
posal for HD DVD advanced interactivity — then the war would be all but over. The camp
with the most content was destined to win. But on December 8, 2004, Disney announced that
it would support Blu-ray Disc. The balance was restored and the game was back in full swing.
2005 – Pits and the Pendulum
On December 4, 2004 in Japan, followed in the US on March 5, 2005, Sony launched the
PlayStation Portable (PSP™) and its new universal media disc (UMD™) format, a 60-mm,
red-laser disc that held 1.8 Gbytes, plenty of room for games and music, and just large
enough to hold a two-hour movie encoded in AVC format. In spite of predictions that no one
really wanted to watch an entire movie holding a small game player in front of their face, PSP
movie titles began to sell briskly. Hollywood studios scrambled to ramp up production and
accelerate planned title releases. DVD Release Report statistics showed that within five
months of launch, over 240 movie and TV titles were in the market or announced, signifi-
cantly more than games. People held up UMD as the example of the right way to launch a
format.
At the CES show, backers of both blue-laser formats promised players and movies in
North America by the end of the year. They were only off by several months.
TDK announced that they had developed a hard-coat process for Blu-ray discs. Although
it could be just as easily applied to HD DVD discs (or DVDs), it was touted as a major advan-
tage of Blu-ray. It did mean that the BDA was finally able to drop requirements for car-
tridges, which no one wanted anyway.
On March 10, Apple Computer announced that it had joined the BDA and would support
Blu-ray.
During March, as a result of strong industry pressure, talks started between Toshiba, Sony,
and Panasonic in an attempt to  unify the formats. Ryoji Chubachi, president of Sony, said,
The Development of Blu-ray Disc

“Listening to the voice of the consumers, having two rival formats is disappointing and we
haven’t totally given up on the possibility of integration or compromise.” Within weeks, how-
ever, it was reported that the talks had completely broken down with neither side willing to
compromise. Those hoping for a single next-generation format watched the situation go from
bad to worse. A format war raged in China between EVD, HVD, and FVD, and convergence
between HD DVD and BD seemed impossible. Meanwhile Microsoft’s WMV-HD had sold
a few titles in the US and was actually doing quite well in Europe. A few AVC-based formats
such as DivX HD and Nero Digital attempted to make a land grab amidst the turmoil, but with
little backing and no distinct disc specification to tie their formats to, they fell by the wayside.
On May 10, Toshiba announced that it had developed a triple-layer HD DVD-ROM disc
with a data capacity of 45 Gbytes, 50 percent more than the 30-Gbyte dual-layer disc. This
brought them within spitting distance of Blu-ray’s 50-Gbyte disc. Proponents of each camp
argued incessantly that the other camp’s highest-capacity disc was a fantasy and would never
see the light of day. And in a somewhat glib response, Blu-ray promoters announced a theo-
retical four-layer version that could hold up to 100 Gbytes.
The pendulum swung toward the HD DVD camp in June 2005 when Microsoft and
Toshiba said they would consider working together on the development of HD DVD players
using Microsoft Windows software. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates hinted that the Xbox 360
might add an HD DVD drive. “The initial shipments of Xbox 360 will be based on today’s
DVD format,” he said. “We are looking at whether future versions of Xbox 360 will incor-
porate an additional capability of an HD DVD player or something else.” It was not exactly
a ringing endorsement of the format, but the Internet reality distortion machine was soon
churning out reports that Gates had chosen HD DVD for the Xbox. Not surprisingly, “con-
sidering” and “looking” turned into doing, and an HD DVD drive was eventually released
for the Xbox. Likewise, Toshiba’s first HD DVD player was co-developed with Microsoft.
On July 29, 2005, the pendulum swung back to the Blu-ray side when 20th Century Fox
officially announced its support. Fox had cleverly hung back until it was the last holdout, so
it was able to wrangle promises of increased content protection mechanisms in Blu-ray in
return for its support. The BDA soon announced that it was adding ROM Mark (a mecha-
nism to deter professional piracy of replicated discs) and BD+ (a system to implant special
code on discs to check player security).
The pendulum inched a bit more toward Blu-ray in August when Lionsgate and Universal
Music Group announced their support.
On August 22, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper in Japan reported that yet another round
of unification negotiations between the Blu-ray Disc Association and the DVD Forum had
failed.
Ironically, there was quite a bit of informal “merging” of specifications occurring behind
the scenes. Some people attended spec-development meetings in both groups. Other com-
panies kept separate delegates for each format, but people working on one format shared
ideas and concerns with colleagues working on the other format. For example, in August an
ad-hoc group of the DVD Forum published the Application Requirements document, a thor-
ough investigation of scenarios desired by Hollywood studios and others in the industry.
Features to support may of these scenarios soon appeared in the Blu-ray format.

Page one of the Washington Post on Sunday, August 28, 2005, carried an obituary for VHS,
“the beloved videotape format that bravely won the war against Betamax and charmed mil-
lions of Americans by allowing them to enjoy mindless Hollywood entertainment without
leaving their homes.” Although 94.7 million American households still owned VCRs, and
more than $3 billion had been spent on VHS rentals and purchases in 2004, revenue from
DVD sales and rentals was more than eight times greater. The unprecedented success of
DVD was pushing VHS off store shelves, out of customer storage cabinets, and into obliv-
ion.
The pendulum swayed back on September 27, when Microsoft finally officially announced
that it would back HD DVD along with Intel. In an interview with the Daily Princetonian, Bill
Gates sniped at Blu-ray, saying, “it’s that the protection scheme on Blu is very anti-con-
sumer,” referring to the added locks and lack of commitment to managed copy, unlike the
HD DVD camp. Gates — and many other Blu-ray detractors — glossed over the crucial
point that managed copy was a feature of AACS so it applied equally to both formats. He fol-
lowed that with a prognostication that “this is the last physical format there will ever be.
Everything’s going to be streamed directly or on a hard disk. So, in this way, it’s even unclear
how much this one counts.” Once again, having Bill Gates as a cheerleader resulted in faint
praise indeed.
In October, Paramount decided it would firmly straddle the fence and offer movies on
both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Warner Bros. also climbed out of the HD DVD camp onto
the fence, announcing it would also release titles in both formats.
At the same time, HP suddenly and publicly called for changes to the Blu-ray format,
strongly suggesting that it would defect to the HD DVD format if its demands were not met.
HP specifically requested two features that were already part of HD DVD — mandatory
managed copy (to allow disc owners to copy content from their discs onto PCs and portable
devices) and iHD (the XML and ECMAScript-based advanced interactivity format that
Microsoft and others had developed in the DVD Forum). HP’s cover story was that it did not
want customers to have to choose between dissimilar competing formats. Conspiracy theo-
ries blossomed — Microsoft was paying HP off or had threatened to shortchange HP’s access
to the Windows OS.
The BDA’s response came from spokesman Andy Parsons on November 16, 2005,
“Mandatory managed copy will be part of the Blu-ray format, but while HP’s request [for
interactivity] is being considered, at this point in time, the Blu-ray group is still proceeding
down the path of Java,” he told Reuters. HP decided this was not good enough, and on
December 16 announced that it would support both HD DVD and Blu-ray.
This was good news for Toshiba, which two days earlier had said that design work on its
first HD-DVD player was complete, with factories ready to produce the players, but that it
was held up waiting for the final version of AACS. Remember AACS? The content protec-
tion system that was going to be done the year before? It was not for lack of effort, since the
group had been gathering regularly for over a year, with meetings often dragging late into the
night, but they had been unable to reach consensus on items such as managed copy and
requests to add BD+ into the mix.

2006 – On Your Marks, Get Set, Go
The big news at CES in January was from Bill Gates, who announced that Microsoft would
offer an add-on HD DVD drive for the Xbox 360 console. HD DVD supporters who expect-
ed a new version of the Xbox with an HD DVD drive built in were not exactly dancing in the
streets, but at least it was some ammunition against the specter of millions of Blu-ray-
equipped PS3s.
The AACS group met on February 10 to crank out the final specifications, but once again
came up empty-handed. Reports stated that “an important member of the Blu-ray Disc
Association is still voicing concerns about the interaction of AACS and the additional BD+
protection for Blu-ray movies.” But there was a massive hitch — Toshiba had planned for a
March launch date, with a 40-city tour starting on February 22 to kick it off. Likewise,
Samsung and Pioneer had picked May launch dates for their Blu-ray players. If AACS was
not ready to go, everyone would be trapped at the starting gate. Finally, on February 15, after
working feverishly for days to come up with a compromise, the AACS group agreed to
release an interim license that would permit hardware makers and disc manufacturers to sign
up for the encryption keys they needed to make the discs and players work together with pro-
tected content. The interim license would leave out elements such as managed copy and
watermark detection. On February 21, the ACCS LA (license administrator) announced
availability of the interim agreement documents, saying, “The final license agreement for
AACS is expected to be announced in the coming months.” Hope sprang eternal.
In related news, on March 14 the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper in Japan reported that
Sony had pushed back the PlayStation 3 release date from early spring to November. This was
allegedly because of the delay in finalizing AACS, but some opined that it was just a handy
excuse to cover Sony’s inability to pull everything together for the complicated game system.
Meanwhile, the meteoric rise of UMD for the PSP (that’s movies on tiny discs for Sony’s
tiny game player, for readers whose acronym buffer has overflowed) had turned into a dis-
astrous tailspin. Initial sales demand from a year earlier had evaporated, and in February,
Sony Pictures, Paramount, Warner, and other smaller studios began delaying or cancelling
UMD movie releases. Sony had shipped more than 10 million PSP units worldwide since its
release a year earlier, but average UMD sales of only 50,000 units mean that less than 1 per-
cent of PSP owners were interested. Various theories were put forth — PSP owners bought
a few movies when they first got their system to try it out, but it turned out that people real-
ly did not want to watch a movie on a tiny screen with tinny speakers while their arm muscles
cramped from holding it; the first rush of titles purchased were from mothers and grand-
mothers who were overjoyed that they could buy something that was not a violent videogame
for their teenager; prices were simply too high compared to DVDs; or people realized they
should not have to buy what they already owned on DVD. The latter theory was rooted in

12These may seem like high prices, but for an introductory high-tech product they are stupendously low.
Consider other introductions in the US (each adjusted for inflation to 2006):  1939 TVs, $2900 to $8700; 1975
Betamax VCR, $8600; 1976 VHS VCR, $3100; 1978 laserdisc player, $2300; 1982 CD player, $2000. iSuppli,
a market analysis company specializing in “teardowns” of products to inspect the components, estimated that
the bill of materials for the HD-A1 came to $674, which revealed that Toshiba was heavily subsidizing the
price in hopes of winning sales.

the growing realization within Hollywood that solutions such as managed copy, to allow con-
sumers to legally move purchased content between media and devices, were needed.
By the end of March, Universal, New Line, and others had cut their UMD releases com-
pletely or to just a trickle. One unnamed studio executive told Hollywood Reporter, “It’s
awful. Sales are near zilch. It’s another Sony bomb — like Blu-ray.” Just over 600 titles had
been released by the time the format neared a total eclipse two years later. In a classic case
of making lemonade out of lemons, many UMD titles wasting in inventory were added as
free “extra bonus discs” in DVD packages.
Toshiba won the race to store shelves, shipping the world’s first HD DVD player, the HD-
XA1, on March 31, 2006 in Japan for ¥110,000 ($940). The HD-XA1 arrived in the US on
April 18, priced at $800, along with its simpler sibling, the $500 HD-A1.12 Each model was,
in fact, a high-powered PC in a box, running Linux on a 2.5-GHz Intel Pentium CPU aug-
mented with a Broadcom decoder chip. The HD-XA1 added four SHARC digital signal
processors (DSPs) to handle the audio processing load. Disc load time was interminable and
the interactive features were sluggish, but the high-definition picture was widely praised in
spite of complaints that it was only 1080i. Toshiba had the market to itself for three months.
On June 20, 2006, Sony and MGM released the first Blu-ray titles — 50 First Dates, The
Fifth Element, Hitch, House of Flying Daggers, The Terminator, Underworld: Evolution, and
XXX. All contained MPEG-2 video, although VC-1 encoders were being used in HD DVD
production. Five days later, the first Blu-ray player appeared in the US — the Samsung BD-
P1000, priced at $1,000. Sony and Pioneer had planned to release Blu-ray players in June, but
pushed their release dates out by a few months. A few days earlier, a Samsung representa-
tive had confessed that the company was considering releasing a “universal” player that
would take both Blu-ray and HD DVD discs.13
At Toshiba’s annual shareholder meeting on June 27, 2006, President Atsutoshi Nishida
said, “We have not given up on a unified format. We would like to seek ways for unifying the
standards if opportunities arise.” 
In July, the first mass-market Blu-ray rewritable drive for the PC, the $700 BWU-100A,
was released by Sony. It recorded both single- and dual-layer BD-R and BD-RE discs.
On September 26, 2006, the first titles using the more efficient VC-1 codec hit the streets
in the US — Corpse Bride, Swordfish, Space Cowboys, The Fugitive, Lethal Weapon 2, and
House of Wax. The next month, Sony Pictures debuted Click, the first title on a dual-layer
disc. Detractors who had up to this point maintained that dual-layer discs were too prob-
lematic and too expensive to be used for mass production quietly melted back into the crowd.
On November 11, 2006, Sony’s PlayStation 3 went on sale in Japan. The US launch fol-
lowed on the 17th, but the PS3 didn’t make it to Europe and elsewhere until March 23, 2007.
The two US models were priced at $500 and $600 (each with an estimated $250 price sub-
sidy), making them the cheapest available Blu-ray players. One million units sold in the US
in less than 2 months, with sales in Japan passing one million units shortly after. By April
2007, over 5 million units had sold worldwide. This was a massive boost to the installed base

13Samsung eventually did release the $1000 BD-UP5000 at the end of 2007, but not before LG beat them to
the punch in February with the $1200 Super Multi Blu BH100, which was rushed to market with only a partial-
ly implementation of HD DVD. Many reviewers remarked that you could buy the Blu-ray-capable PS3 and an
HD DVD player together for less than the price of the combo player and get a game console “for free.”

of Blu-ray players, and although game titles obviously competed with Blu-ray video titles for
mindshare and play time, later data from Sony indicated that 87 percent of PS3 owners
watched Blu-ray discs on their system.
Just in time for the holidays, a hacker under the alias of muslix64 made a December 27
posting on the Doom9 Internet discussion boards claiming success in breaking part of the
AACS content protection scheme with a program called BackupHDDVD. He (or she) did
point out that, “This software don’t [sic] provide any cryptographic keys, so you have to add
your own keys.” It turned out that the crack was not all that helpful, as it required someone
very knowledgeable to figure out where in memory a Blu-ray or HD DVD software player
kept the AACS decryption key for a particular volume, extract the keys, and then plug them
into BackupHDDVD to decrypt the disc. Since every title has a different key, the sleuthing
had to be repeated for each title, although, of course, lists of keys soon appeared on the
Internet and, as expected, the AACS LA then used the legal muscle of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to send cease-and-desist letters to Web sites posting
“stolen” AACS keys. The game of cat and mouse was afoot.
2007 – HD Formats Take their Second Lap
At CES, LG Electronics unveiled their dual-format player. Many people in the industry
predicted that if the format war did not end within a few years, dual-format players would
become the norm, and the battle would end in détente rather than producing a single sur-
viving format. In a similar vein, Warner Bros. showed off a prototype disc, dubbed THD for
Total HD, carrying both an HD DVD and a Blu-ray layer to be compatible with either kind
of player. (It turned out that THD never made it past the demo stage.)
On January 24, AACS LA released a statement in response to the December news, say-
ing, “AACS LA has confirmed that AACS Title Keys have appeared on public websites with-
out authorization. Such unauthorized disclosures indicate an attack on one or more players
sold by AACS licensees. This development is limited to the compromise of specific imple-
mentations, and does not represent an attack on the AACS system itself.” In a restrained jab
at the software developers whose products had exposed the keys, the statement went on to
say, “it illustrates the need for all AACS licensees to follow the Compliance and Robustness
Rules set forth in the AACS license agreements to help ensure that product implementations
are not compromised.” The software developers were privately told they had a few months
to fix their players. The story picks up again in April....
In February, VHS turned 30 years old. As if echoing the theme from Logan’s Run, Wal-
Mart — the world’s biggest video retailer, with over 30 percent of DVD and VHS sales —
finally abandoned VHS. Back in June 2005, long after Circuit City and others had pushed
VHS tapes off the shelves, there had been a spurious report that Wal-Mart was exiting the
VHS business, but this time it was for real. DVD reigned supreme.
In April 2007, step-by-step instructions on how to reset region code change counts in the
four major software players (CyberLink PowerDVD, Corel WinDVD, Arcsoft Total Media
Theater, and Nero Showtime) began to appear on websites. The process was usually as simple
as deleting a file or stopping a service to be able to change the region code an unlimited num-
ber of times.

On April 16, AACS LA announced that it had taken action to “expire the encryption keys”
(is expire now a transitive verb?) of specific implementations of AACS-enabled software.
The revocation feature of AACS was being activated, which allowed the encryption key struc-
ture to be changed on new discs so that they would not play on compromised players. The
AACS LA posted links to websites of CyberLink and Corel, where users could download
security updates that kept their players working with new discs and did a better job of obfus-
cating AACS keys. Of course, the new versions of the software applications were soon
cracked as well, and cracking websites with lists of keys popped up in new places like moles
in a carnival game, but at least AACS was able to stay ahead of the game, unlike CSS, which
lost most of its efficacy once all the player keys were compromised.
In May, the new head of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), Dan
Glickman, said that the AACS support behind managed copy would be ready before the end
of the year. Once again, the pessimists in the audience were doubtful and, once again, even
their extensions of Glickman’s assertion turned out to be madly optimistic.
On June 30, 2007, BD+ Technologies, the company licensing the additional content pro-
tection layer for Blu-ray, announced that it had completed the specifications for BD+.
Luckily the industry had not waited for them.
In August, the HD DVD backers worked to swing the pendulum back in their direction.
Microsoft cut the price of its HD DVD add-on drive for the Xbox 360 from $199 to $179 and
threw in five free movies. Toshiba allegedly offered Paramount and Dreamworks each $75
million to drop Blu-ray in favor of HD DVD, which they both did with announcements on
August 20.
On September 7, in response to another round of attacks because of inadequate security
in the CyberLink PowerDVD software player, AACS LA announced it was again revoking
keys. AACS also announced that it was activating another feature of AACS, proactive
renewals, which required software products to periodically release updates that refreshed the
AACS encryption keys. Software that was not updated would no longer be able to play newly
released discs. The software companies — who knew it was coming — grumbled but com-
plied, since by this time it was common to provide automatic downloadable software updates.
In October 2007, Panasonic released the DMP-BD30K, the first Blu-ray Profile 1.1
(BonusView) player on the market, beating its competitors by a few months, even Sony’s PS3,
which did not receive a software update to Profile 1.1 until December 18. However, discs
using Profile 1.1 features were nowhere to be found.
In November 2007, apparently feeling pressure from the gradually increasing sentiment
that Blu-ray was winning the format war, Toshiba held closeout sales of old-model HD DVD
players at several major retailers in the US. Limited quantities of players were sold for less
than $100, causing a few stampedes and minor injuries. The HD DVD promotion group
announced that 750,000 HD DVD players had been sold, which included standalone players
and the Xbox 360 add-on.
Also in November, SlySoft, the makers of the popular but, in many cases, illegal AnyDVD
ripping software, released a new version that could crack and rip the few Blu-ray discs pro-
tected by BD+. Of course BD+ was designed to be changed when the algorithms were
cracked, but SlySoft claimed they’d figured out the basics and could handle any variation that
BD+ threw at them.

On December 10, 2007, the world’s first Blu-ray disc to use the Profile 1.1 picture-in-pic-
ture feature, Neues vom Wixxer, was released in Germany from Imagion AG. Unfortunately,
no one could try out the feature since there were no Profile 1.1 players in Germany. On the
other side of the pond, the US had Profile 1.1 players but no discs. Finally, on December 20,
New Line released Rush Hour 3 in the US, the first disc there to use picture in picture.
The year closed out with reports of multi-region Blu-ray players appearing for sale on web-
sites outside of the US. Firmware modifications had apparently been made to the Samsung
BD-P1400, Sony BDP-S300, and Sony BDP-S500 to make them switchable between Blu-ray
regions A and B as well as DVD regions 1 and 2. The modified players were not cheap, rang-
ing from $900 to $1,300.
2008 – The War Is Over, Long Live Blu-ray
On the first day of 2008, Lionsgate released War, the first BD-Live disc. It was a fitting title
given the state of the industry and the chest-thumping leading up to CES. Rumors were cir-
culating that Warner Bros. would announce its allegiance to one format. Everyone knew what
this meant if it were true. Given the stalemate between the formats, and with Warner repre-
senting roughly 40 percent of available studio content but releasing most of its titles in both
formats, any move in either direction would drastically tip the balance. But some rumors
pegged HD DVD while others named Blu-ray. Then, on January 4, 2008, Warner dropped its
bombshell — it would phase out HD DVD and move exclusively to Blu-ray. A shell-shocked
HD DVD Promotion Group canceled its CES news conference. Toshiba executives immedi-
ately flew back to Japan. Apparently they had been expecting Warner to announce it would
be exclusive to HD DVD. Unsubstantiated reports declared that Sony and/or the BDA had
paid Warner anywhere from $250 to $500 million dollars, beating Toshiba’s highest offer.
Some reports claimed that Fox switching to HD DVD was to have been part of the deal,
which was improbable in the extreme, given how hard Fox had worked to get BD+ into Blu-
ray. Warner Home Entertainment President Kevin Tsujihara denied that there had been a
payoff, maintaining that it was about choosing the best format for consumers. Warner had
been in the expensive position of releasing two versions of every title, and Blu-ray discs had
been outselling HD DVD discs roughly 2:1 for the previous year.
Toshiba responded with a statement that began, “Toshiba is quite surprised by Warner
Bros.’ decision to abandon HD DVD in favor of Blu-ray, despite the fact that there are var-
ious contracts in place between our companies concerning the support of HD DVD,” and
ended with, “We will assess the potential impact of this announcement with the other HD
DVD partner companies and evaluate potential next steps. We remain firm in our belief that
HD DVD is the format best suited to the wants and needs of the consumer.” Translation:
“Warner broke our agreements. If we weren’t a polite Japanese company we would sue them.
We don’t know what to do now, but we can repeat our mantra.”
Flurries of articles, blogs, and opinion pieces announced the imminent end of the format
war, laying short odds on how long Toshiba would last. In a sense it became a self-fulfilling
prophecy. By this time the industry, the press, and the public were so tired of the delays, the
uncertainty, and the waste of time and money dealing with two irreconcilable formats that
they welcomed any excuse to get it all over with and move on. The fat lady was warming up

in the dressing room.
Toshiba tried measures such as cutting the price of the HD-A3 player to $150 and running
a $2.7 million Super Bowl ad. But the bad news kept coming —
j New Line, HBO, and National Geographic Presents all followed in the footsteps
of their parent Warner and announced they would phase out HD DVD.
j The BDA Promotions committee announced that roughly 3.5 million Blu-ray
players had been sold to date in the US (three million PS3 consoles and 500,000
standalone players). Over 10.5 million PS3s had been sold worldwide. This com-
pared to roughly 850 thousand HD DVD players in the US and just over one
million worldwide (300,000 PCs with HD DVD drives, 300,000 Xbox 360 drives,
and 430,000 standalone players).
j An Xbox group marketing manager said Microsoft would consider a Blu-ray
add-on drive for the Xbox 360. Oops, hang on — the next day Microsoft re-
affirmed its belief that HD DVD was the best optical disc for consumers and
that it had no plans to support Blu-ray Disc on the Xbox 360.
j Nielsen VideoScan data showed that for the week ending January 13, all ten of
the top ten high definition discs in the US home video sales and rental charts
were Blu-ray discs.
j Analyst firm NPD said that for the week ending January 12, Blu-ray players out-
sold HD DVD players 9 to 1. HD DVD player sales sank from 14,558 two weeks
before to a meager 1,758. Blu-ray sales jumped from 15,257 to 21,770 for a 93
percent share. NPD analysts cautioned that one week of data did not a trend
make.14
j Sonic Solutions, the main provider of professional authoring tools for both HD
DVD and Blu-ray formats announced that its Professional Products Group
would focus on Blu-ray.
j Woolworths in the UK announced that beginning in March it would sell only
Blu-ray discs.
j NetFlix announced it would phase out HD DVD discs by the end of the year.
(Blockbuster had decided in June the year before to stock only Blu-ray titles.)
j BestBuy stated it would focus on Blu-ray. 
j Rumors that Circuit City would follow suit were dispelled when a representative
stated that the company would remain platform agnostic. A statement from the
President of Philips Consumer Electronics that Target would go exclusively Blu-
ray was unsubstantiated.
j Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said it would phase out HD DVD prod-
ucts by June.

stated that Blu-ray player unit sales in the US had dropped 40 percent from January to February while HD
DVD player unit sales dropped only 13 percent. In the next period, from February to March, Blu-ray players
saw a 2 percent increase while HD DVD entered its death spiral, dropping 65 percent. Blu-ray proponents
pointed out that the January to March period followed a very successful holiday season and sales were down
partly because of low inventory.

There were a few glimmers of good news. Universal stated that it had no plans to abandon
HD DVD. An online “Save HD DVD” petition garnered over 31,600 signatures by February
8, while the competing “Let HD DVD Die” petition had reached only 11,300. 
The fat lady was clearing her throat. Rumors surfaced from The Hollywood Reporter and
elsewhere that Toshiba was preparing to throw in the towel. Japanese public broadcaster
NHK reported on February 18 that Toshiba was closing its HD DVD production factories.
The Nikkei Business Daily reported that Toshiba would announce tomorrow the discontinua-
tion of HD DVD. Sure enough, on February 19, 2008, Toshiba formally announced it would
quickly phase out the production of HD DVD players and recorders by the end of March.
“We concluded that a swift decision would be best,” said Toshiba President Atsutoshi
Nishida.
The fat lady had sung. The format war was over, exactly six years after it stepped onto the
public stage.15
The dominos fell quickly after that, with Universal Studios announcing the same day that
it would be releasing movies on the Blu-ray format, and Paramount making the same
announcement two days later. 
In March, Toshiba projected that it would lose $665 million (¥65 billion) at the upcoming
end of its fiscal year, “reflecting the discontinuation of the HD DVD business and the decline
in sales prices of NAND flash memories.” Goldman Sachs had earlier said that pulling out
of the HD DVD business would improve Toshiba’s profitability by $370 to $460 million a
year.
In retrospect, the competition between Blu-ray and HD DVD was beneficial, to a point. It
drove both groups to push harder for advanced features, sped the pace of development, and
kept prices low. However, it would have been much better had there been a reconciliation
around the middle of 2005, when the prospect was still workable. 
On March 25, 2008, Sony’s PlayStation 3 became the first Profile 2 (BD-Live) player by
virtue of a software upgrade.
On May 27 the first Blu-ray audio-only release, Divertimenti, performed by the Trondheim
Solistene ensemble, was released in Norway by 2L. Although there were as yet no Profile 3
(audio-only) players, the disc played on standard Blu-ray players but showed just how many
of them were incapable of reproducing 192-kHz audio.
May 27 also marked the release of the last US HD DVDs from a major studio, P.S. I Love
You and Twister from Warner Bros.
In June, the first standalone BD-Live player arrived, the Panasonic DMP-BD50. At a
launch party on June 9 for Sleeping Beauty (which would not appear until four months later),
Disney Studios president Bob Chapek said, “Every subsequent Disney title will have BD-
Live.” Contrary to Disney’s approach with DVD, which had been to hang back until the for-
mat was established, then cautiously ensure that every title played on as many players as pos-
sible, Disney was pushing the envelope with dozens of groundbreaking features. It was a
clever strategy that forced player makers to fix deficiencies in their players and prodded the

others studios to keep up. A few weeks later, Rich Marty of Sony Pictures stated that  all the
studio’s titles from the end of June on would have some level of BD-Live interactivity. Marty
said that so far one in five BD-Live disc buyers had activated and used the online features.
Given the difficulty of connecting players to the Internet, 20 percent was a promising num-
ber.
On July 8, the BDA announced that China’s DigiRise DRA digital audio coding technolo-
gy had passed technical evaluation, paving the way for it to be formally adopted for the China
version of Blu-ray. China remained the last battleground for HD DVD, which had been
adapted to form the CBHD (formerly CH-DVD) specification for use in China.
At the International Symposium on Optical Memory in July, a team of Pioneer engineers
presented results showing that a 20-layer Blu-ray discs was viable, potentially providing a
whopping 500 Gbytes on a single disc.
Meanwhile, the final version of AACS was getting closer to takeoff but was still being
delayed on the tarmac. In September, reports from a BDA news conference indicated that
the final license was delayed yet again. Published articles referred to industry officials who
said that managed copy complications were causing the delay because of concerns that a
company could own the rights to release a movie on disc but not as a digital sale, which might
or might not encompass a managed copy. In private conversations fingers were again point-
ing to Fox for slowing things down with its almost fanatically cautious scrutiny of details. To
be fair, there had been plenty of complications and external demands hampering progress
throughout the process, such as adding BD+, accommodating the China HD format, and
getting the key generation facilities up and running. In spite of that, draft documents were
circulated with a hoped-for final date in mid October, which would clear the way for man-
aged copy to be available in July 2009. This would also require Blu-ray players released after
May 2009 to check for audio watermarks.
On September 18, 2008, Memorex signaled the inevitable price drops heading into the hol-
iday sales season with the first Blu-ray player priced below $270.
Three weeks later, players began to appear at Amazon.com and RadioShack.com on sale
for $199, blasting through the $250 barrier that few people expected to be broken before
2009. In spite of the near-meltdown of economies around the world, hopes were high for
healthy holidays for Blu-ray, heading into the crucial shopping season for once without a con-
flicting format to confuse and deter potential buyers. Hit titles were coming close to selling
a million copies each — a breakthrough often considered to herald the coming of age of a
new format. At long last, Blu-ray was beginning to fulfill its considerable potential.

Chapter 2
Technology Primer
This chapter1 explains key technologies developed for or used by Blu-ray Disc™. Many of
the fundamental technologies in use with DVD are being used by the Blu-ray Disc (BD) for-
mat. We feel it is beneficial to use the advances instituted with DVD as aids in understand-
ing the Blu-ray format.
Understanding Digital and Analog
We live in an analog world. Our perceptions are stimulated by information that is received
in smooth, unbroken form, such as sound waves that apply varying pressure on our eardrums,
a mercury thermometer showing infinitely measurable detail, or a speedometer dial that
moves continuously across its range. Digital information, on the other hand, is a series of
snapshots depicting analog values coded as numbers, such as a digital thermometer that
reads 71.5 degrees or a digital speedometer that reads 69 mph.2
The first recording techniques used analog methods — changes in physical material such
as wavy grooves in plastic discs, silver halide crystals on film, or magnetic oxides on tape.
After transistors and computers appeared, it was discovered that information signals could
be isolated from their carriers if stored in digital form. One of the major advantages of digi-
tal information is that it is infinitely malleable. It can be processed, transformed, and copied
without losing a single bit of information.
Analog recordings always contain noise (such as, tape hiss) and random perturbations, so
each generation of recording or transmission decreases in quality. Digital information can
pass through multiple generations, such as, from a digital video master, through a network,
over the Internet, into a computer, out to a recordable DVD or BD, back into a computer,
through the computer graphics chips, out over an HDMI (High Definition Multimedia
Interface) connection, and into a digital monitor, all with no loss of quality. Digital signals
representing audio and video can also be numerically processed. Digital signal processing is
what allows AV receivers to simulate concert halls, surround sound headphones to simulate
multiple speakers, and studio equipment to enhance video or correct colors.

Demystified Third Edition, High Definition DVD Handbook, and The HD Cookbook. We hope this neither
confuses nor disturbs the reader.
2There are endless debates about whether the “true” nature of our world is analog or digital. Consider again
the thermometer. At a minute level of detail, the readings can’t be more accurate than a molecule of mercury.
Physicists explain that the sound waves and photons that excite receptors in our ears and eyes can be treat-
ed as waves or as particles. Waves are analog, but particles are digital. Research shows that we perceive
sound and video in discrete steps, so our internal perception is actually a digital representation of the analog
world around us. There are a finite number of cones in the retina, similar to the limited number of photorecep-
tors in the CCD of a digital camera. At the quantum level, all of reality is determined by discrete energy states
that can be thought of as digital values. However, for the purposes of this discussion, referring to gross
human perception, it’s sufficiently accurate to say that sound and light, and our sensation of them, are analog.

When storing analog information in digital form, the trick is to produce a representation
that is very close to the original. If the numbers are exact enough (such as a thermometer
reading of 71.4329 degrees) and repeated often enough, they closely represent the original
analog information.3
Digital video is a sheet of dots, called pixels, each holding a color value. This is similar to
drawing a picture by coloring in a grid, where each square of the grid can only be filled in
with a single color. If the squares are small enough and there is sufficient range of colors, the
drawing becomes a reasonable facsimile of reality. For Blu-ray, each grid of 1920 squares
across by 1080 squares down represents a still image, called a frame. Twenty-four to sixty
frames are shown each second to convey motion.
Digital audio is a series of numbers representing the intensity, or amplitude, of a sound
wave at a given point. For BD, these numbers are “sampled” over 48,000 times a second
(sampling may be performed as frequently as 192,000 times a second for super-high–fidelity
audio), providing a much more accurate recording than is possible with the rough analogues
(pun intended) of vinyl records or magnetic tape. When a digital audio recording is played
back, the stream of numerical values is converted into a series of voltage levels, creating an
undulating electrical signal that drives a speaker.
Pits and Marks and Error Correction
Data is stored on optical discs in the form of microscopic pits (see Figure 2.1). The space
between two pits is called a land. On writable discs, pits and lands are often referred to as
marks and spaces. Read-only discs are stamped in a molding machine from a liquid plastic
such as polycarbonate or acrylic and then coated with a reflective metallic layer. Writable
discs are made of material designed to be physically changed by the heat of a laser, creating
marks. As the disc spins, the pits (or marks) pass under a reading laser beam and are detect-
ed according to the change they cause in the intensity of the beam. These changes happen
very fast (over 980,000 times per second on Blu-ray Discs) and create a stream of transitions
spaced at varying intervals: an encoded digital signal.

3Ironically, digital data is stored on analog media. The pits and lands on a DVDor a BD are not of a uniform
depth and length, and they do not directly represent ones and zeros. They produce a waveform of reflected
laser light that represents coded runs of zeros and transition points. Digital tape recordings use the same
magnetic recording medium as analog tapes. Digital connections between AV components (digital audio
cables, HDMI cables, etc.) encode data as square waves at analog voltage levels. However, in all cases, the
digital signal threshold is kept far above the noise level of the analog medium so that variations do not cause
errors when the data is retrieved.
Figure 2.1  Optical Disc Pits

Many people assume that the digital ones and zeros that comprise the data stored on the
disc are encoded directly as pits and lands, but the reality is actually much more complicat-
ed. Pits and lands both represent strings of zeros of varying lengths, and each transition
between them represents a one, but neither is a direct representation of the contents of the
disc. Almost half of the information has been used to pad and rearrange (modulate) the data
in sequences and patterns designed to be accurately readable as a string of pulses.
Modulation makes sure strings of zeros aren’t too long (no more than 10) or too short (no
fewer than two) and that there is only a single one between them (since ones are represent-
ed by “edges” and it’s not physically possible to have two edges together.)
About 13 percent of the digital signal before modulation is extra information for correct-
ing errors. Errors can occur for many reasons, such as imperfections on the disc, dust,
scratches, a dirty lens, and so on. A human hair is about as wide as 150 pits, so even a speck
of dust or a minute air bubble can cover a large number of pits. However, the laser beam
focuses past the surface of the disc so the spot size at the surface is much larger and is hard-
ly affected by anything smaller than a few millimeters. This is similar to the way dust on a
camera lens is not visible in the photographs because the dust is out of focus. As the data is
read from the disc, the error correction information is separated and checked against the
remaining information. If it doesn’t match, the error correction codes are used to try to cor-
rect the error.
The error correction process is like a number square, where you add up columns and rows
of numbers (see Figure 2.2). You could play a game with these squares where a friend ran-
domly changes a number and challenges you to find and correct it. If the friend gives you the
sums along with the numbers, you can add up the rows and columns and compare your totals
against the originals. If they don’t match, then you know that something is wrong—either a
number has been changed or the sum has been changed.4 If a number has been changed,

To help put the burning process in perspective, consider that at 16x DVD
recording speeds a disc makes 10,800 rotations per minute, corresponding to a
linear velocity of 56 meters per second (over 200 km/h), while marks are burned
with a precision of less than 0.05 micrometer!
NOTE
Figure 2.2  Number Squares
4It is possible for more than one number to be changed in such a way that the sum still comes out correct,
but the BD encoding format makes this an extremely rare occurrence.

then a corresponding sum in the other direction also will be wrong. The intersection of the
incorrect row and incorrect column pinpoints the guilty number and, in fact, by knowing what
the sums are supposed to be, the original number can be restored. The error correction
scheme used by DVD and BD is a bit more complicated than this but operates on the same
general principle.
It is always possible that so much of the data is corrupted that error correction fails. In this
case, the player must try reading the section of the disc again. In the very worst cases, such
as, an extremely damaged disc, the player will be unable to read the data correctly after mul-
tiple attempts. At this point, a movie player will continue on to the next section of the disc,
causing a brief glitch in playback. A DVD-ROM or a BD-ROM drive, on the other hand,
cannot do this. Computers will not tolerate missing or incorrect data, so the -ROM drive
must signal the computer that an error has occurred so that the computer can request that
the drive either try again or give up.
Layers
One of the innovations of DVD and Blu-ray Disc is to use layers on the disc to increase
storage capacity. Commercially, there are only single-layer and dual-layer discs, but research
is ongoing and discs containing four, eight, and more layers are under development.
The laser that reads the disc can focus at different levels so that it can look through a layer
to read the layer beneath. With a dual-layer disc, the outside layer is coated with a semire-
flective material that enables the laser to read through it when focused on the inner layer.
When the player reads a disc, it starts at the inside edge of the track area and moves toward
the outer edge, following a spiral path. When the laser reaches the end of the first layer, it
quickly refocuses onto the second layer and starts reading in the opposite direction, from the
outer edge toward the inner. This is known as opposite track path (OTP) or reverse spiral dual
layer (RSDL). Unlike DVD, BD does not allow parallel track path (PTP), where the second
layer can optionally spiral from the hub to the outer diameter. Refocusing happens very
quickly, but on most DVD players the video and audio pause for a fraction of a second as the
player searches for the resumption point on the second layer. For BD, if the player has a
large enough buffer and the disc is carefully designed to lower the data rate at the layer
switch point (so that the buffer will take longer to empty), the laser pickup may have time to
refocus and retrack without causing a visible break.
The DVD specification requires backwards compatibility with the earlier CD format and
the BD specification does not require players to read DVDs, but manufacturers recognize
have a snowball’s chance in Hollywood of surviving. The difficult part is that the pits on CDs,
DVDs, and BDs are all at different levels (see Figure 2.3). In essence, the newer format play-
er must be able to focus a laser at different distances. This problem has various solutions,
including using lenses that switch in and out, and holographic lenses that are actually focused
at more than one distance simultaneously. Further, each format uses a different wavelength
—780nm infrared for CD, 650nm red for DVD, and 405nm blue for BD — so multiple lasers
or multi-wavelength diodes are needed.

The remaining task to ensure CD and DVD compatibility requires an extra bit of circuit-
ry and firmware for reading format-specific data. However, the CD family is quite large and
includes some odd characters, not all of which fit well with DVD and BD. The prominent
members of the CD family are audio CD, Enhanced CD (or CD Plus), CD-ROM, CD-R,
CD-RW, CD-i, Photo CD, CDV, and Video CD. It would be technically possible to support
all these yet most of them require specialized hardware. Therefore, some manufacturers
choose to support only the most common or easiest-to-support versions. Disc types, such as
Enhanced CD and Video CD, are easy to support with existing hardware. Others, such as
CD-i and Photo CD, require additional hardware and interfaces, so they are not commonly
supported. Given that the native data on a CD or a DVD can be read by any compatible BD
system, conceivably any CD and DVD format could be supported. Computers support more
CD formats than DVD and BD players partly because some are designed for computer appli-
cations and also because specialized CD systems can be simulated with computer software.

The Two HDs — High Definition and High Density
With Blu-ray Disc, the acronym “HD” has more than one meaning. Although this book
regards “HD” as shorthand for “high definition” because the disc can contain high definition
video, the acronym can also mean high density when refering to the physical disc. The BD for-
mat uses the same basic technology as DVD and CD, but one of the key differences is that
the pits and lands are recorded at a much higher density. As a result, a shorter wavelength
blue laser must be used to read the disc, just as DVD required a shorter wavelength (635-650
nm) laser relative to CD (780 nm).
Backward compatibility with DVD and CD is a de facto requirement for BD, just as DVD
players needed to support CD formats to succeed in the marketplace. This results in signifi-
cant challenges for the player manufacturers, who must design pick-up heads that contain
three lasers, one for each wavelength, all aiming down the same emission path. For Blu-ray
Disc, this is particularly challenging because BD uses a different type of lens than its fellow
travellers. Instead of the 0.65 NA (numeric aperture) lens that CD and DVD both use, Blu-
ray hosts a 0.85 NA lens, which corresponds to a much shorter focal length. As a result, the
pickup head and the drive mechanism have to be much more sophisticated in order to adjust
for the difference in focal length between BD and the other disc formats.
Another effect of the Blu-ray 0.85 NA lens is that it results in a much smaller spot on the
surface of the disc. As a result, dust, hair, fingerprints and scratches all have a much greater
negative impact on the player’s ability to read the disc. The size of a particle or a scratch is
considerably larger for the laser spot diameter of a BD player than that of a DVD or CD. As
a result, there is far less of the defocusing effect described earlier and the resulting signal is
much more degraded by a surface aberration.
The BD format has taken two steps to address this issue. First, disc caddies (for BD-RE)
and special hard surface coats have been adopted to help protect the surface of the discs
from fingerprints, scratches, or anything that may threaten the readability of the disc.
Second, BD uses much stronger error correction, allowing it to more easily detect and cor-
rect errors that may have occured while reading the disc. One interesting technique used is
to almost double the size of the error control block such that a read error from a hair or fin-
erprint has much less significance relative to the size of the error control block. In essence,
the larger error control block in BD offers essentially the same increase in resiliency as the
defocusing effect for DVD and CD.
The World’s Television Systems
It is important to understand how the world’s television systems were developed. Not to
get the reader bogged down in minutiae, but without a basic knowledge of how and why US
television operates differently from other countries, it is very difficult to explain, let alone
understand, the variety of frame rates and video resolutions that are now available with high
definition television.
There are three standard definition television (SDTV) systems in the world. The NTSC
Technology Primer

standard is used in Canada, Mexico, the U.S, and Japan. NTSC is shorthand for National
Television Systems Committee. The PAL standard and its variations PAL-M and PAL-N are
used in most of Europe, as well as China, India, South America, Africa, and Australia. PAL
is shorthand for Phase Alternating Line. A third standard, known as SECAM, is in use in
Russia and France. SECAM is the acronym for Système Électronique pour Couleur avec
Mémoire. The English translation of SECAM is Sequential Color with Memory. Production
for SECAM is accomplished using PAL format equipment. These television standards are
adapted from the electrical standards of the respective countries.
Long before the invention of television, the US standard for electricity was developed so
that manufacturers would be able to make products that would work when plugged in to a
common electrical source. The US standard was set at 110/120 volts, with the system chang-
ing polarity from positive to negative and back again, 60 times a second. This sequence is
referred to as alternating current, with each positive/negative polarity change termed a cycle.
In Europe, the standard was set at 220/240 volts and 50 cycles per second.
When first introduced, television broadcasts were in black and white, and the NTSC stan-
dard mandated a rate of 30 frames per second with two fields comprising a frame, for 60
fields per second. NTSC uses 525 scan lines to compose a frame, with the odd lines displayed
as field one and the even lines displayed as field two. The fields interlace on presentation to
compose a frame. The PAL standard adopted a rate of 25 frames per second, also comprised
of two fields, for 50 fields per second, and uses 625 scan lines to compose a frame.
The scan line counts are the product of a string of small integer factors that, at the time,
could only be reliably supported by vacuum tube divider circuits — 525 is 7×5×5×3, and
625 is 5×5×5×5. These divider circuits derive the field rate from the power line rate. These
factors combined to give monochrome NTSC 525/60 television a line rate of
30×(7×5×5×3), or exactly 15.750 kHz. Monochrome PAL 625/50 television has a line rate
of 25×(5×5×5×5), or exactly 15.625 kHz. With the introduction of color for television, the
NTSC number takes on immense significance, whereas the PAL signal structure was mostly
unaffected.
In 1953, when adding color to the monochrome signal, a second NTSC determined that it
would be appropriate to choose a color subcarrier in the region of 3.6 MHz. This subcarrier
would imbed the color information within the television signal. But there was a technical con-
cern with adding the color information without disturbing the sound subcarrier element of
the signal. Too close a relationship in the subcarrier frequencies would result in distortion
that would become visible in the luminance component of the signal.
Remember that the responsibility for setting broadcast standards resides with the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). If the FCC had altered the sound subcarrier frequen-
cy to be increased by the fraction 1001/1000 (as recommended by the second NTSC) — that
is, increased by 4.5 kHz to about 4.5045 MHz — then the color subcarrier in NTSC could
have been exactly 3.583125 MHz, the line and the field rates would have been unchanged,
and we would have retained exactly 30 frames per second!
But true to form, alas, the FCC refused to alter the sound subcarrier for fear of possible
minor audio interference on existing black and white television receivers. Instead, the FCC
Technology Primer

chose to reduce both the line rate and the field rate by the fraction 1001/1000, effectively
dropping those rates to about 15.734 kHz and 59.94 Hz, respectively. Thus the 59.94 rate was
born!5
Unfortunately the field rate of 60 divided by 1.001, rounded to 59.94 for convenience,
means that 60 fields consumes slightly more than one second, so 30 frames no longer agrees
with one second of clock time. As a side note, this precipitated the invention of dropframe
timecode that, ostensibly, alleviated this disparity.
Regrettably, the shortsighted, although pragmatic, FCC decision helped to bring about the
frame and video rate complexity that exists today. This is further amplified by the continuing
convergence of video and computer technologies and terminologies, let alone the emergence
of high definition standards and formats. As noted in the Introduction, a billion might mean
something other than a thousand million.
Frame Rates
With the exceptions of cinema, computer displays, and HDTVs, we are in a universe of
NTSC and PAL television systems. Even with cinema, though, that may be the initial display,
only to be rapidly followed by conversion to video for alternate market exploitation. Thus, no
matter the acquisition, television boundaries will be encountered by virtually every produc-
tion.
The explosion in frame rate flexibility of video acquisition cameras has been generated by
the desire to match film acquisition settings, so that a video camera can achieve the cine-look
of film. That is a highly subjective goal. One person’s “cine-” is another person’s “(fill in your
own word here)”. At the upper reaches of the technology, that is to say the more expensive
end of the spectrum, the “cine-look” attained by a video camera is indistinguishable from a
film source. And there are tools that can be used that will enhance footage from a lower-end
camera that may render the final product compatible with a satisfactory “film-like” look.
But, when using video tools in place of film, extreme care must be exercised in all aspects
of image preparation — lighting, set design, cast choices, costumes, makeup, time of day and
phase of the moon. It must be understood that video tools have limitations in extreme con-
ditions that may preclude their use. If the image acquired by the source is less than desired,
no amount of manipulation after the ‘get’ can save the picture.
But what exactly is “frame rate”? Is it a component of acquisition or of display, or both?
You’re probably not gonna love us for this one...it is both, and more.
Frame rate in acquisition establishes the speed with which action is transcribed to media,
capturing moments in time either as two fields or as a frame. Frame rate in display estab-
lishes the frequency with which frames are presented for viewing. Frame rate is expressed in
the number of frames per second, or, by the number of frames in Hertz. What’s “Hertz”?
Hertz is a unit of frequency equivalent to cycles per second. Alternating current of 60 cycles
per second can be called 60 Hertz. Hertz is abbreviated “Hz”.

5Actually, the number 59.94 is rounded off, as the fraction results in an incomplete number that repeats the
integers in the sequence 59.9400599400599400599400599400...forever.

Additionally, there are two methods of frame construction — interlace and progressive.
Interlace is the method of interweaving the two fields that comprise a frame. Progressive is
the method of contiguously presenting all of the lines that comprise a frame, as in a snapshot.
Interlace is represented as “i” and progressive is represented as “p”.
There are five primary frame rate standards for television and movies —
j 30i: 30 frames interlaced, comprised of 60 fields. For NTSC, this is really 59.94
fields, interlaced, composing 29.97 frames per second.
j 30p:   30 frames, progressive, for video cameras, producing an image without
interlaced field artifacts. For NTSC, this is really 29.97 frames per second.
j 25i:   25 frames interlaced, comprised of 50 fields.
j 25p:   25 frames progressive.
j 24p: 24 frames, progressive, for film and capable video cameras.
Depending on the camera, there are any number of frame rates that may be used for the
acquisition rate. With a film camera, the standard acquisition rate is either 24 or 25 frames
per second (fps), depending on the region of display. Film cameras can be run off-speed,
either sped up or slowed down, to accomplish various special effects and/or to capture scenes
under unique conditions.
Since their invention, NTSC color video cameras have captured images at the rate of 59.94
fields per second. Nowadays, high definition capable video cameras can be set to record
either 59.94 fields per second or 59.94 frames per second, as well as rates from 2 frames per
second to 60 frames per second. Unfortunately, we identify all of these rates with the abbre-
viation “fps”.
Very often, the goal is to give video images a “cine-look”, so the opportunity to shoot
footage at a rate equivalent to the film rate is highly prized. However, 59.94 fields per sec-
ond is equal to shooting 29.97 frames per second. We have to get from 29.97 to 24, and you
cannot get there from there. But you can get to 23.9766, which is sometimes rounded to
23.98. Employing the frame rate of 23.98 also allows for an easy expansion to the 29.97 or
59.94 rates by the use of what are called “pulldown” techniques, wherein fields or frames are
duplicated to meet the higher rate. This allows for the integration of “cine-look” video with
other video assets, as well as the presentation of the footage via television. (Although that
might defeat the quest for “cine-”, wouldn’t it? But we digress…)
Further, with sophisticated circuitry, sensors and integrated chips, some video cameras
may be set to record 24 frames per second, also known as “true 24”. However, 24 fps is not
natively compatible with an NTSC display, but video shot at 24 frames per second can read-
ily integrate with film originals that are shot at 24 frames per second. It is this fluidity of
medium that accommodates the extensive use of computer generated imagery and augmen-
tation that is evident in motion pictures today.
As noted earlier, if you are producing for theatrical presentation exclusively you can estab-
lish 24 fps as the production criteria, whether shooting film or video. The follow-on produc-
tion steps would all respect the 24 fps rate, and all will remain as intended.

623.976 is shorthand for the result of dividing 24 by 1,001. The actual quotient is the incomplete number
23.976002397600239760023976...forever, akin to the result that gives us 59.94.

But, “true 24” and “23.98” are not the same. In fact, 23.98 can become something called
progressive segmented frame (PsF), wherein the odd lines from the frame are segregated from
the even lines for the frame. This is not the same as interlace fields because the progressive
frame segments are not presented sequentially. Rather, the two segments are recombined
prior to presentation as a single frame. The PsF technique allows for easier integration with
interlace technologies.
Beyond the imaging source is the recording device for saving and storing the images
acquired. The recording rate for devices may be set independently from the frame rate,
depending on the technology employed. Once again, it is the ultimate display criteria that
should govern the settings for recording. The 24 fps rate may be used when the footage is
destined for cinema, whereas a rate of 29.97 Hz or 59.94 Hz should be used when footage
will appear on television. Put another way, when the intent is to shoot cine-like video, set the
camera to image 23.98 fps and the recording device to match NTSC display criteria.
And what about frame rate for display, as in the frequency that images are presented for
viewing? The methods for presentation vary between platforms — projectors, television
receivers, and displays. A projector runs at a speed of 24 frames per second, but shows each
frame twice, thereby displaying the film at the rate of 48 Hz. This action is done to minimize
the perception of flicker between frame images.
Television receivers present the image standard for their format, PAL or NTSC, as either
25 or 29.97 frames per second, respectively, but given the interlaced field construction of the
frames, the display rate is either 50 or 59.94 Hz.
Technology has provided new ways to display images that are not bound to television stan-
dards and do not use a cathode-ray tube (CRT) for presentation. These displays are capable
of presenting standard definition television, high definition television, and images from a
variety of sources — disc players, hard drives, computers, et cetera. The circuitry employed
by these technologies provides vastly improved control over the data being displayed. And,
we are now able to view images with display rates that are multiples of either television or
film frame rates — 48, 60, 72 Hz and higher (120 Hz is highly regarded as it is a multiple of
both 24 and 30). These increased frame display rates can significantly improve the perceived
clarity, depth, and color characteristics of a presentation, depending on the breadth of fea-
tures included in the display.
High Definition Image Resolutions
Image resolution is determined by several factors — image size, frame style, color or chro-
ma sampling, and data bit rate or depth. When multiplied by frame rate, we get the data rate
required for streaming images to a display and/or to storage. Picture sizes for high definition
and beyond generate exceptionally large numbers, both in terms of data rate and cumulative
data for storage.
The high definition digital television formats defined by the ATSC (Advanced Television
Systems Committee)7 are —

7The ATSC standards are intended to replace the NTSC system and are being adopted by many other coun-
tries besides the US. The ATSC has defined systems for both standard and high definition television, but only
the high definition formats are included here.

j 1280 pixels per line×720 lines, in 16:9 widescreen aspect, with progressive
frames, at frame rates of 23.976, 24, 29.97, 30, 59.94 and 60 per second
j 1920 pixels per line×1080 lines, in 16:9 widescreen aspect, with either —
j interlace frames, at frame rates of 29.97 (59.94 fields) and 30 (60
fields) frames per second, or
j progressive frames, at frame rates of 23.976, 24, 29.97 and 30 frames
per second
Shorthand is applied to these standards, resulting in the terms 720p, 1080i, and 1080p.
Adding frame rates to those terms, creates terms like 720/24p or 1080/30i. Although, in the
case of 720, the “p” is unnecessary as all of the frame rates for 720 lines are progressive.
Also, please note that the much ballyhooed image rates of 1080/60p and 1080/59.94p are
not included in the ATSC high definition standards. Another component of the ATSC stan-
dards is the use of MPEG-2 compression in the transmission of data for the ATSC formats.
All of the ATSC image formats are compressed somewhat to accommodate the bandwidth
allocation for television channel transmission. With the conversion to digital television, the
channel bandwidth allocation is only 19.39 megabits per second for over-the-air transmission.
The high data rates generated by images at 1080/60p (59.94) would result in poor image qual-
ity when compressed, transmitted, uncompressed, and displayed.
The ATSC standards notwithstanding, Blu-ray Disc specifications define high definition
video as —
j picture sizes, in 16:9 widescreen aspect —
j 1920 pixels per line×1080 lines
j 1440 pixels per line×1080 lines
j 1280 pixels per line×720 lines
j display frame rates —
j for 1080 lines — frames rates of 23.976p, 24p, 25i, 29.97i per second
j for 720 lines — frame rates 23.976p, 24p, 50p, 59.94p per second
The Blu-ray Disc frame rate of 23.976 for both 1080 and 720 includes a 2-3 pulldown
instruction in order to display at 29.97 frames per second. Depending on the connection type
and the display type, this frame type may be either interlace or progressive.
Typically, Blu-ray Discs will have content that is encoded at either 1080/24p or
1080/23.976p for film-based content, and 1080/29.97i or 1080/25i for video-based content.
And, please note that marketing jargon will refer to these numbers as 1080/24p and 1080/30i
(or 1080/60i, which does not mean 60 frames per second).
Whereas ATSC incorporates MPEG-2 compression in meeting the delivery and display
requirements for television broadcast, Blu-ray can use either MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 AVC or
VC-1 for compression, and is not restricted by the digital television channel bandwidth limi-
tation. These expanded compression choices allow for improved data rates, at higher com-
pression levels. The Blu-ray Disc maximum data rate for the video component of the trans-
port stream is 40.0 Mbps. Thus, the seeds for confusion are sown when comparing data rates
for broadcast high definition television with that of high definition discs.

Chroma Subsampling and Bit Depth
Another component of image data is the sampling that is performed on an image. This is
referred to as chroma subsampling, and is generally expressed as a three number ratio, such
as, 4:4:4 or 4:2:2 or 4:2:0, among others. These numbers reflect the sampling rate and method
that is applied to the luminance and chrominance components of an image. The theory
behind this sampling process is that the human eye is more sensitive to changes in brightness
(luminance) than changes in color (chrominance), and there is no perceived loss when sam-
pling color details at a lower rate. The signal is divided into a luminance element (Y’) and
two color difference elements that are derived as red minus luminance (Cr) and blue minus
luminance (Cb)8. But, the three numbers are not directly related to the three signal elements
and instead reflect the methodology of the sample (otherwise, the 4:2:0 variant would have
no data for one of the color channels...doh!).
The terms 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 were developed for standard definition digital video. Nowadays,
the sampling rates for high definition video are 22:22:22 and 22:11:11, respectively, but casu-
al use of the SD terms has been adopted for the HD rates.
Technically, sampling is performed using rates that are multiples of 3.375 MHz, and 4
times 3.375 is 13.5 MHz and 22 times 3.375 is 74.25 MHz. Thus, 4:4:4 means that the signal
elements are each sampled at 13.5 MHz (74.25 MHz for HD). Sampling at 4:4:4 provides
close to real-life color representation and is considered to be lossless. Taking advantage of
the different sensitivity to color perception, 4:2:2 samples the luminance at 13.5 MHz (74.25
MHz), but the color difference signals are each sampled at 6.75 MHz (37.125 MHz) or one
half the frequency of 4:4:4. The ratio 4:2:0 means that the luminance is still sampled at 13.5
MHz, but the color difference channels are subsampled by a factor of 2 both horizontally and
vertically, in a two-line grouping structure. The 4:2:0 sampling scheme is the method in use
for BD, as well as standard DVD.
Bit depth reflects the number of bits used to store information about each sample. The
higher the bit depth means that more bits per pixel are used for an image, and the more pix-
els used for an image then the larger the image file. Eight bits provide up to 256 color gra-
dations from black to white, while 10 bits provide up to 1024 color gradations from black to
white. And, there are 12-bit schemes that, in conjunction with 4:4:4, provides for the best
image quality currently available.
High Definition Data Streams
The goal is capturing data digitally at the highest possible quality given the current capa-
bilities of technology. Translating these image format sizes and frame rates to continuous
data streams requires advanced degrees in mathematics or an association with some
extremely knowledgeable and quick partners. In our case, we have a couple of authors who
can rattle off data rate computations on request (see Table 2.1).

8The terms Y’, Cb, and Cr denote digital encoded component video signals. The terms Y, R-Y, and B-Y are
used to denote analog component signals. Technically, these terms are not interchangeable, although tech
talk frequently crosses the term boundaries.

Table 2.1 provides a sampling of the data rates that are generated when working with high
definition data streams. What is important to note is that even before compression is exe-
cuted on an image data stream, the amount of data can be reduced dramatically by choosing
a different sampling scheme, and/or by resampling the image data to meet the requirements
of BD playout, which is 4:2:0 YUV 8-bit.
There is a concerted effort underway to address the issue of producing HD images in the
1080 line format with 60 progressive frames per second. Termed 1080/60p, the hope is that
cameras will be capable of acquiring images in that image format and productions will be
able to take advantage of the perceived superior resolution. But this quest overlooks the hard
fact of exactly how much data can be transmitted via an HD Serial Digital Interface (HD
SDI) link, the standard for connecting cameras to recording devices, monitors, et cetera. The
maximum data rate for a single HD SDI link is 1.485 Gbps, including audio. As you can see
in Table 2.1, the data rate for 1080/60 interlaced video, sampled at 4:4:4 12 bit, is 2.24 Gbps,
and the data rate at 4:2:2 YUV 10 bit is 1.24 Gbps. This means that HD SDI cannot accom-
modate 4:4:4 12-bit data, but can accommodate 4:2:2 10-bit data. When these data rates are
doubled to accommodate 60p, it becomes obvious that some other interconnection is
required.
Standards have been established for a dual-link HD SDI structure which ties two HD SDI
links together in parallel, which is intended to accommodate 4:4:4 sampling or 1080/60p. Yet
another standard was adopted in June 2006 for a 2.97 Gbps interface that uses a single cable,
which may be used to replace the dual-link approach.

That, then, is the conundrum. Even if cameras and sensors are created that are capable of
1080/60p acquisition, the production infrastructure will have to be changed. New tools need
to be and are being developed, as well as taking on the massive tasks of updating editing and
workstation interfaces to accommodate the realtime needs when presenting images at these
gargantuan data rates. All of these are considerable undertakings.
And yes, these 1080/60p data rates could be dramatically reduced with compression, but
wouldn’t that be self-defeating? We’ll leave it to others to decide.
Birds Over the Phone: Understanding Video
Compression
After compact discs (CDs) appeared in 1982, digital audio became a commodity. It took
many years before the same transformation began to work its magic on video. The step up
from digital audio to digital video is a doozy, for in any segment of standard definition tele-
vision there is about 250 times as much information as in the same-length segment of CD
audio. The trick is to reduce the amount of information without significantly reducing the
quality of the picture. As we have seen, the solution is digital compression.
In a sense, you employ compression in daily conversations. Picture yourself talking on the
phone to a friend. You are describing the antics of a particularly striking bird outside your
window. You might begin by depicting the scene and then mentioning the size, shape, and
color of the bird. But when you begin to describe the bird’s actions, you naturally don’t repeat
your description of the background scene or the bird. You take it for granted that your friend
remembers this information, so you only describe the action — the part that changes. If you
had to continually refresh your friend’s memory of every detail, you would have very high
phone bills. The problem with TV is that it has no memory — the picture has to be continu-
ally refreshed. It’s as if the TV were saying, “There’s a patch of grass and a small tree with a
4-inch green and black bird with a yellow beak sitting on a branch. Now there’s a patch of
grass and a small tree with a 4-inch green and black bird with a yellow beak hanging upside
down on a branch. Now there’s a patch of grass and a small tree with a 4-inch green and black
bird with a yellow beak hanging upside down on a branch trying to eat some fruit,” and so
on, only in much more detail, redescribing the scene 30 times a second. In addition, a TV
individually describes each piece of the picture even when they are all the same. It would be
as if you had to say, “The bird has a black breast and a green head and a green back and
green wing feathers and green tail feathers and...” (again, in much more meticulous detail)
rather than simply saying, “The bird has a black breast, and the rest is green.” This kind of
conversational compression is second nature to us, but for computers to do the same thing
requires complex algorithms. Coding only the changes in a scene is called conditional replen-
ishment.
The simplest form of digital video compression takes advantage of spatial redundancy—
areas of a single picture that are the same. Computer pictures are comprised of a grid of dots,
each one a specified color, but many of them are the same color. Therefore, rather than stor-

ing, say, a hundred red dots, you store one red dot and a count of 100. This reduces the
amount of information from 100 pieces to 3 pieces (a marker indicating a run of similar col-
ored dots, the color, and the count) or even 2 pieces (if all information is stored as pairs of
color and count), as shown in Figure 2.4. This is called run-length encoding (RLE). It is a form
of lossless compression, meaning that the original picture can be reconstructed perfectly with
no missing detail. Run-length encoding is great for synthetic images — simple, computer-gen-
erated images containing relatively few colors. However, this method does not work well for
most natural images (e.g., photographs) because in the natural world there are continuous,
subtle changes in color that thwart the RLE process.
If you take the fundamental concept behind run-length encoding, which is to find redun-
dancies by identifying correlations in the data, and then apply more sophisticated pattern
search algorithms and efficient symbol replacement (e.g., replace a 10-byte pattern with an
8-bit symbol each time that pattern appears), you will have an even more effective version of
lossless compression. The PNG image format, which is primarily used for graphics on Blu-
ray Discs, supports compression filters, which provide different search algorithms for identi-
fying and reducing redundant patterns in the image data. With these formats, even natural
images can start to see at least some benefit (though it is still more effective for synthetic
images where there tend to be more and larger repeating patterns).
To reduce picture information even more, lossy compression is required. This results in
information being removed permanently. The trick is to only remove detail that will not be
noticed. Many such compression techniques, known as psychovisual encoding systems, take
advantage of a number of aspects of the human vision system —
j The eye is more sensitive to changes in brightness than changes in color.
j The eye is unable to perceive brightness levels above or below certain thresholds.
j The eye cannot distinguish minor changes in brightness or color. This percep-
tion is not linear, with certain ranges of brightness or color more important visu-
ally than others. For example, variegated shades of green such as leaves and
plants in a forest are more easily discriminated than various shades of dark blue
such as in the depths of a pool.
j Gentle gradations of brightness or color (such as a sunset blending gradually
into a blue sky) are more important to the eye and more readily perceived than
abrupt changes (such as pinstriped suits or confetti).
The human retina has three types of color photoreceptor cells, called cones.9 Each is sen-
sitive to different wavelengths of light that roughly correspond to the colors red, green, and

monly called night vision.

blue. Because the eye perceives color as a combination of these three stimuli, any color can
be described as a combination of these primary colors.10 Televisions work by using three elec-
tron beams to cause different phosphors on the face of the television tube to emit red, green,
or blue light, abbreviated to RGB. Television cameras record images in RGB format, and
computers generally store images in RGB format.
RGB values are a combination of brightness and color. Each triplet of numbers represents
the intensity of each primary color. As just noted, however, the eye is more sensitive to
brightness than to color. Therefore, if the RGB values are separated into a brightness com-
ponent and a color component, the color information can be more heavily compressed. The
brightness information is called luminance and is often denoted as Y’.11 Luminance is essen-
tially what you see when you watch a black-and-white TV. Luminance is the range of inten-
sity from black (0 percent) through gray (50 percent) to white (100 percent). A logical
assumption is that each RGB value would contribute one-third of the intensity information,
but the eye is most sensitive to green, less sensitive to red, and least sensitive to blue, so a
uniform average would yield a yellowish green image instead of a gray image.12
Consequently, it is necessary to use a weighted sum corresponding to the spectral sensitivity
of the eye, which is about 70 percent green, 20 percent red, and 10 percent blue (Figure 2.5).
The remaining color information is called chrominance (denoted as C), which is made up
of hue (the proportion of color — the redness, orangeness, greenness, etc.), and saturation
(the purity of the color, from pastel to vivid). For the purposes of compression and convert-
ing from RGB, it is easier to use color difference information rather than hue and saturation. 
The color information is what’s left after the luminance is removed. By subtracting the
luminance value from each RGB value, three color difference signals are created: R-Y, G-Y,
and B-Y. Only three stimulus values are needed, so only two color difference signals need to
be included with the luminance signal. Since green is the largest component of luminance, it
has the smallest difference signal (G makes up the largest part of Y, so G-Y results in the
smallest values). The smaller the signal, the more it is subject to errors caused by noise, so
B-Y and R-Y are the best choice for use as the color difference values. The green color infor-

10You may have learned that the primary “colors” are red, yellow, and blue. Technically, these are magenta,
yellow, and cyan and usually refer to pigments rather than colors. A magenta ink absorbs green light, thus
controlling the amount of green color perceived by the eye. Since white light is composed of equal amounts of
all three colors, removing green leaves red and blue, which together form magenta. Likewise, yellow ink
absorbs blue light, and cyan ink absorbs red light. Reflected light, such as that from a painting, is formed from
the character of the illuminating light and the absorption of the pigments. Projected light, such as that from a
television, is formed from the intensities of the three primary colors. Since video is projected, it deals with red,
green, and blue colors.
11The use of Y for luminance comes from the XYZ color system defined by the Commission Internationale de
L’Eclairage (CIE). The system uses three-dimensional space to represent colors, where the Y axis is lumi-
nance and X and Z axes represent color information.
12Luminance from RGB can be a difficult concept to grasp. It may help to think of colored filters. If you look
through a red filter, you will see a monochromatic image composed of shades of red. The image would look
the same through the red filter if it were changed to a different color, such as gray. Since the red filter only
passes red light, anything that’s pure blue or pure green won’t be visible. To get a balanced image, you would
use three filters, change the image from each one to gray, and average them together.

mation can be recreated by subtracting the two difference signals from the Y signal (rough-
ly speaking). Different weightings are used to derive Y and color differences from RGB, such
as YUV, YIQ, and Y’CbCr. DVD uses Y’CbCr as its native storage format. (Details of the
data variations are beyond the scope of this book.)
The sensitivity of the eye is not linear, and neither is the response of the phosphors used
in television tubes. Therefore, video is usually represented with corresponding nonlinear val-
ues, and the terms luma and chroma are used. These are denoted with the prime symbols as
Y’ and C’, as is the corresponding R’G’B’. (Details of nonlinear functions are also beyond
the scope of this book.)
Compressing Single Pictures
An understanding of the nuances of human perception led to the development of com-
pression techniques that take advantage of certain characteristics. Just such a development
is JPEG compression, which was produced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and is now
a worldwide standard. JPEG separately compresses Y, B-Y, and R-Y information, with more
compression done on the latter two, to which the eye is less sensitive.

Figure 2.5  Color and Luminance Sensitivity of the Eye

To take advantage of another human vision characteristic — less sensitivity to complex
detail — JPEG divides the image into small blocks and applies a discrete cosine transform
(DCT) to the blocks, which is a mathematical function that changes spatial intensity values
to spatial frequency values. This describes the block in terms of how much detail changes,
and roughly arranges the values from lowest frequency (represented by large numbers) to
highest frequency (represented by small numbers). For areas of smooth colors or low detail
(low spatial frequency), the numbers will be large. For areas with varying colors and detail
(high spatial frequency), most of the values will be close to zero. A DCT is an essentially loss-
less transform, meaning that an inverse DCT function can be performed on the resulting set
of values to restore the original values. In practice, integer math and approximations are
used, causing some loss at the DCT stage. Ironically, the numbers are bigger after the DCT
transform. The solution is to quantize the DCT values so that they become smaller and repet-
itive.
Quantizing is a way of reducing information by grouping it into chunks. For example, if
you had a set of numbers between 1 and 100, you could quantize them by 10. That is, you
could divide them by 10 and round to the nearest integer. The numbers from 5 to 14 would
all become 1s, the numbers from 15 to 24 would become 2s, and so on, with 1 representing
10, 2 representing 20, and so forth. Instead of individual numbers such as 8, 11, 12, 20, and
23, you end up with “3 numbers near 10” and “2 numbers near 20.” Obviously, quantizing
results in a loss of detail.
Quantizing the DCT values means that the result of the inverse DCT will not exactly
reproduce the original intensity values, but the result is close and can be adjusted by varying
the quantizing scale to make it finer or coarser. More importantly, as the DCT function
includes a progressive weighting that puts bigger numbers near the top left corner and small-
er numbers near the lower right corner, quantization and a special zigzag ordering result in
runs of the same number, especially zero. This may sound familiar. Sure enough, the next
step is to use run-length encoding to reduce the number of values that need to be stored. A
variation of run-length coding is used, which stores a count of the number of zero values fol-
lowed by the next nonzero value. The resulting numbers are used to look up symbols from a
table. The symbol table was developed using Huffman coding to create shorter symbols for
the most commonly appearing numbers. This is called variable-length coding (VLC). See
Figures 2.6 and 2.8 for examples of DCT, quantization, and VLC.
The result of these transformation and manipulation steps is that the information that is
thrown away is least perceptible. Since the eye is less sensitive to color than to brightness,
transforming RGB values to luminance and chrominance values means that more chromi-
nance data can be selectively thrown away. And since the eye is less sensitive to high-fre-
quency color or brightness changes, the DCT and quantization process removes mostly the
high-frequency information. JPEG compression can reduce picture data to about one-fifth
the original size with almost no discernible difference and to about one-tenth the original size
with only slight degradation.

Compressing Moving Pictures
Motion video adds a temporal dimension to the spatial dimension of single pictures.
Another worldwide compression standard, MPEG, from the Moving Pictures Expert Group,
was designed with this in mind. MPEG is similar to JPEG but also reduces redundancy
between successive pictures of a moving sequence.
Just as your friend’s memory allows you to describe things once and then only talk about
what is changing, digital memory allows video to be compressed in a similar manner by first
storing a single picture and then only storing the changes. For example, if the bird moves to
another tree, you can tell your friend that the bird has moved without needing to describe the
bird over again.
MPEG compression uses a similar technique called motion estimation or motion-compen-
sated prediction. As motion video is a sequence of still pictures, many of which are very sim-
ilar, and each picture can be compared with the pictures next to it, the MPEG encoding
process breaks each picture into blocks, called macroblocks, and then hunts around in neigh-
boring pictures for similar blocks. If a match is found, instead of storing the entire block, the
system stores a much smaller vector describing how far the block moved (or did not move)
between pictures. Vectors can be encoded in as little as one bit, so backgrounds and other
elements that do not change over time are compressed most efficiently. Large groups of
blocks that move together, such as large objects or the entire picture panning sideways, are
also compressed efficiently.
MPEG uses three kinds of picture storage methods. Intra pictures are like JPEG pictures,
in which the entire picture is compressed and stored with DCT quantization. This creates a
reference frame from which successive pictures are built. These I frames also allow random
access into a stream of video, and in practice occur about twice a second. Predicted pictures,
or P frames, contain motion vectors describing the difference from the closest previous I
frame or P frame. If the block has changed slightly in intensity or color (remember, frames
are separated into three channels and compressed separately), then the difference (error) is
also encoded. If something entirely new appears that does not match any previous blocks,
such as a person walking into the scene, then a new block is stored in the same way as in an
I frame. If the entire scene changes, as in a cut, the encoding system is usually smart enough
to make a new I frame. The third storage method is a bidirectional picture, or B frame. The
system looks both forward and backward to match blocks. In this way, if something new
appears in a B frame, it can be matched to a block in the next I frame or P frame. Thus P and
B frames are much smaller than I frames.
Experience has shown that two B frames between each I or P frame work well. A typical
second of MPEG video at 30 frames per second looks like I B B P B B P B B P B B P B B I
B B P B B P B B P B B P B B (see Figure 2.7). B frames are more complex to create than P
frames, requiring time-consuming searches in both the previous and subsequent I or P frame.
For this reason, some realtime or low-cost MPEG encoders only create I and P frames.
Likewise, I frames are easier to create than P frames, which require searches in the subse-
quent I or P frame. Therefore, the simplest encoders only create I frames. This is less effi-
cient but may be necessary for very inexpensive realtime encoders that must process 30 or
more frames a second.

MPEG-2 encoding can be done in realtime (where the video stream enters and leaves the
encoder at display speeds), but it is difficult to produce quality results, especially with vari-
able bit rate (VBR) encoding. Variable bit rate allows varying numbers of bits to be allocated
for each frame depending on the complexity of the frame. Less data is needed for simple
scenes, while more data can be allocated for complex scenes. This results in a lower average
data rate but provides room for data peaks to maintain quality. Encoding frequently is done
with variable bit rate and is usually not done in realtime, so the encoder has plenty of time
for macroblock matching, resulting in much better quality at lower data rates. Good encoders
make one pass to analyze the video and determine the complexity of each frame, forcing I
frames at scene changes and creating a compression profile for each frame. They then make
a second pass to do the actual compression, varying quantization parameters to match the
profiles. The human operator often tweaks minor details between the two passes. Many low-
cost MPEG encoders, hardware or software, for personal computers use only I frames, espe-
cially when capturing video in realtime. This results in a simpler and cheaper encoder, since
P and B frames require more computation and more memory to encode. Some of these sys-
tems can later reprocess the I frames to create P and B frames. MPEG also can encode still
images as I frames. Still menus on a DVD, for example, are I frames.
The result of the encoding process is a set of data and instructions (see Figure 2.8). These
are used by the decoder to recreate the video. The amount of compression (how coarse the
quantizing steps are, how large a motion estimation error is allowed) determines how close-
ly the reconstructed video resembles the original. MPEG decoding is deterministic — a given
set of input data always should produce the same output data. Decoders that properly imple-
ment the complete MPEG decoding process will produce the same numerical picture even if
they are built by different manufacturers.13 This doesn’t mean that all DVD players will pro-
duce the same video picture. Far from it, since many other factors are involved, such as con-
version from digital to analog, connection type, cable quality, and display quality. Advanced
decoders may include extra processing steps such as block filtering and edge enhancement.
Also, many software MPEG decoders take shortcuts to achieve sufficient performance.

13Technically, the inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) stage of the decoding process is not strictly pre-
scribed, and is allowed to introduce small statistical variances. This should never account for more than an
occasional least significant bit of discrepancy between decoders.

Software decoders may skip frames and use mathematical approximations rather than the
complete but time-consuming transformations. This results in lower-quality video than from
a fully compliant decoder.
Encoders, on the other hand, can and do vary widely. The encoding process has the great-
est effect on the final video quality. The MPEG standard prescribes a syntax defining what
instructions can be included with the encoded data and how they are applied. This syntax is
quite flexible and leaves considerable room for variation. The quality of the decoded video
depends on how thoroughly the encoder examines the video and how cleverly it goes about
applying the functions of MPEG to compress it. Video quality steadily improves as encoding
techniques and equipment get better. The decoder chip in the player will not change, but the
improvements in the encoded data will provide a better result. This can be likened to read-

ing aloud from a book. The letters of the alphabet are like data organized according to the
syntax of language. The person reading aloud from the book is similar to the decoder — the
reader knows every letter and is familiar with the rules of pronunciation. The author is sim-
ilar to the encoder — the writer applies the rules of spelling and usage to encode thoughts
as written language. The better the author, the better the results. A poorly written book will
come out sounding bad no matter who reads it, but a well-written book will produce eloquent
spoken language.14
It should be recognized that random artifacts in video playback (aberrations that appear
in different places or at different times when the same video is played over again) are not
MPEG encoding artifacts. They may indicate a faulty decoder, errors in the signal, or some-
thing else independent of the MPEG encode-decode process. It is impossible for a fully com-
pliant, properly functioning MPEG decoder core module to produce visually different results
from the same encoded data stream, although in practice there are variations in implemen-
tation along with added video processing steps that make the output from every player or
decoding software application look different.
MPEG (and most other compression techniques) are asymmetric, meaning that the encod-
ing process does not take the same amount of time as the decoding process. It is more effec-
tive and efficient to use a complex and time-consuming encoding process because video gen-
erally is encoded only once before being decoded hundreds or millions of times. High-qual-
ity MPEG encoding systems can cost tens of thousands dollars, but since most of the work is
done during encoding, decoder chips cost less than $20, and decoding can even be done in
software.
Some analyses indicate that a typical video signal contains over 95 percent redundant
information. By encoding the changes between frames, rather than re-encoding each frame,
encoders can achieve amazing compression ratios (see Table 2.2).
Advanced Video Codecs
There are two new compression/decompression (codec) technologies that are part of the
specification for Blu-ray Disc, and they are considered to be almost twice as efficient as
MPEG-2. The first of these codecs, SMPTE VC-1, is a video codec defined by the Society of
Motion Picture Television Engineers (SMPTE) as an “open standard” and is based on
Microsoft’s Windows Media Video 9 technology. Development for Windows Media began
years after the creation and standardization of MPEG-2 and has the benefit of building on
the lessons learned there. Windows Media (and now VC-1) have demonstrated dramatic
improvements in compression efficiency over MPEG-2 and MPEG-1 codecs. For example,
prior to adoption of the codec in either HD DVD or BD, Microsoft began promoting a pro-
prietary Windows Media Video HD (WMV-HD) format that showcased Windows Media
Video by putting high definition content onto standard red-laser DVDs. The content, at res-

olutions of 1280×720×24 fps and 1920×1080×24 fps, was encoded at constant data rates
from 6.0 to 12.0 Mbps for playback on Windows Media-capable PCs. Few personal comput-
ers at the time had the processing power needed to present the full-size HD video at a con-
sistent frame rate, but the WMV-HD format did go a long way to establish Windows Media,
and later VC-1, as a serious video codec.
Taking a more traditional development path, MPEG-4 Advanced Video Codec (AVC), also
known as ITU H.264 Part 10, was developed by the Joint Video Team (JVT), a co-operation
between MPEG (under the ISO) and the ITU-T.15 Designed with the intention of improving
coding efficiency of video by a factor of two or more, uses for H.264 span multimedia appli-
cations ranging from video on cell phones to high definition televisions, using a dramatic
range of data rates and screen resolutions. In the evaluation of advanced codecs performed
by both the DVD Forum and the Blu-ray Disc Founders group, MPEG-4 AVC quickly estab-
lished itself as the leader and was the first advanced codec to be accepted into the Blu-ray
format. The AVC codec includes in its toolset of compression algorithms a wide range of
options, allowing AVC encoders to achieve high quality at lower data rates.
Both VC-1 and AVC push asymmetric encoding/decoding to extremes, with first genera-
tion implementations of the encoders requiring approximately 30 to 50 times more process-
ing power than equivalent MPEG-2 encoders. Likewise, compared to MPEG-2, these
advanced video codecs require significantly more processing power when decoding, but there
the difference is perhaps only a factor of 4 to 1.
These advanced codecs achieve a 50 percent reduction in the size of a video stream. Table
2.2 shows some comparative data rates for the compression technologies.

Birds Revisited: Understanding Audio Compression
Audio takes up much less space than video, but uncompressed audio coupled with com-
pressed video uses up a large percentage of the available bandwidth. Compressing the audio
can result in a small loss of quality, but if the resulting space is used instead for video, it may
improve the video quality. In essence, reducing both the audio and the video is usually most
effective. Usually video is compressed more than audio, since the ear is more sensitive to
detail loss than the eye.
Just as MPEG compression takes advantage of characteristics of the human eye, modern
audio compression relies on detailed understanding of the human ear. This is called psy-
choacoustic or perceptual coding.
Picture, again, your telephone conversation with a friend. Imagine that your friend lives
near an airport, so that when a plane takes off, your friend cannot hear you over the sound
of the airplane. In a situation like this, you quickly learn to stop talking when a plane is tak-
ing off, since your friend won’t hear you. The airplane has masked the sound of your voice.
At the opposite end of the loudness spectrum from airplane noise is background noise, such
as, a ticking clock. While you are speaking, your friend can’t hear the clock, but if you stop,
then the background noise is no longer masked.
The hairs in your inner ear are sensitive to sound pressure at different frequencies (pitch-
es). When stimulated by a loud sound, they are incapable of sensing softer sounds at the
same pitch. Because the hairs for similar frequencies are near each other, a stimulated audio
receptor nerve will interfere with nearby receptors and cause them to be less sensitive. This
is called frequency masking.
Human hearing ranges roughly from low frequencies of 20 Hz to high frequencies of
20,000 Hz (20 kHz). The ear is most sensitive to the frequency range from about 2 to 5 kHz,
which corresponds to the range of the human voice. Because aural sensitivity varies in a non-
linear fashion, sounds at some frequencies mask more neighboring sounds than at other fre-
quencies. Experiments have established certain critical bands of varying size that correspond
to the masking function of human hearing (see Figure 2.9).

gNote that the compressed rate of Dolby TrueHD streams is heavily dependent on the source material. Values

Another characteristic of the human audio sensory system is that sounds cannot be sensed
when they fall below a certain loudness (or amplitude). This sensitivity threshold is not lin-
ear. In other words, the threshold is at louder or softer points at different frequencies. The
overall threshold varies a little from person to person — some people have better hearing
than others. The threshold of hearing is adaptive; the ear can adjust its sensitivity in order to
pick up soft sounds when not overloaded by loud sounds. This characteristic causes the effect
of temporal masking, in which you are unable to hear soft sounds for up to 200 milliseconds
after a loud sound and for 2 or 3 milliseconds before a loud sound.16
Perceptual Coding
Standard definition DVD uses three audio data reduction systems — Dolby Digital (AC-
3) coding, MPEG audio coding, and DTS (Coherent Acoustics) coding. Blu-ray Disc uses
two of those — Dolby Digital (AC-3), and DTS — and adds several audio codecs to the col-
lection — Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby True HD, DTS-HD High Resolution, and DTS-HD
Master Audio.17 All use mathematical models of human hearing based on sensitivity thresh-

16How can masking work backward in time? The signal presented by the ear to the brain is a composite built
up from stimuli received over a period of about 200 milliseconds. A loud noise effectively overrides a small
portion of the earlier stimuli before it can be accumulated and sent to the brain.
17DTS-HD Master Audio is an optional audio codec for Blu-ray Disc. Blu-ray Disc can also use Linear PCM
(Pulse Code Modulation) as an audio codec. As Linear PCM is regarded as uncompressed, we chose to not
list it here, to avoid arguments about whether it does or does not reduce audio data. But we’ll probably get an
argument, anyways. Ah, well...

olds, frequency masking, and temporal masking to remove sounds that you cannot hear. The
resulting information is compressed to about one-third to one-twelfth the original size with
little to no perceptible loss in quality (see Table 2.2).
Digital audio is sampled by taking snapshots of an analog signal thousands of times a sec-
ond. Each sample is a number that represents the amplitude (strength) of the waveform at
that instance in time. Perceptual audio compression takes a block of samples and divides
them into frequency bands of equal or varying widths. Bands of different widths are designed
to match the sensitivity ranges of the human ear. The intensity of sound in each band is ana-
lyzed to determine two things: (1) how much masking it causes in nearby frequencies and (2)
how much noise the sound can mask within the band. Analyzing the masking of nearby bands
means that the signal in bands that are completely masked can be ignored. Calculating how
much noise can be masked in each band determines how much compression can be applied
to the signal within the band. Compression uses quantization, which involves dividing and
rounding, and this can create errors known as quantization noise. For example, the number
32 quantized by 10 gives 3.2 rounded to 3. When re-expanded, the number is reconstructed
as 30, creating an error of 2. These errors can manifest themselves as audible noise. After
masked sounds are ignored, remaining sounds are quantized as coarsely as possible so that
quantization noise is either masked or is below the threshold of hearing. The technique of
noise masking is related to noise shaping and is sometimes called frequency-domain error con-
finement.
Another technique of audio compression is to compare each block of samples with the
preceding and following blocks to see if any can be ignored on account of temporal masking
— soft sounds near loud sounds — and how much quantization noise will be temporally
masked. This is sometimes called temporal-domain error confinement.
Digital audio compression also can take advantage of the redundancies and relationships
between channels, especially when there are six or eight channels. A strong sound in one
channel can mask weak sounds in other channels, information that is the same in more than
one channel need only be stored once, and extra bandwidth can be temporarily allocated to
deal with a complex signal in one channel by slightly sacrificing the sound of other channels.
Audio compression techniques result in a set of data that is processed in a specific way by
the decoder. The form of the data is flexible, so improvements in the encoder can result in
improved quality or efficiency without changing the decoder. As understanding of psychoa-
coustic models improves, perceptual encoding systems can be improved.
At minimal levels of compression, perceptual encoding removes only the imperceptible
information and provides decoded audio that is virtually indistinguishable from the original.
At higher levels of compression, and depending on the nature of the audio, bit starvation may
produce identifiable effects of compression. These include a slightly harsh or gritty sound,
poor reproduction of transients, loss of detail, and less pronounced separation and spa-
ciousness.
Many listeners claim that DTS audio quality is better than Dolby Digital, but such claims
are rarely based on accurate comparisons, and may be another form of perceptual influence
— that of assuming higher bitrates means higher quality. Within the confines of any given

codec, that is usually true, but it cannot be assumed when comparing codecs of differing effi-
ciencies — something that has become abundantly clear when comparing MP3s to iTunes
AAC recordings. DTS tracks are usually encoded at a reference volume level that is 4 dB
higher, and most DTS soundtracks are mixed differently than their Dolby Digital counter-
parts, including different volume levels in the surround and LFE tracks. This makes it nigh
impossible to compare them objectively, even using a disc that contains a soundtrack in both
formats. The limited semi-scientific comparisons that have been done indicate that there is
little perceptible difference between the two and that any difference may be noticeable only
on high-end audio systems.
Linear Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
Linear PCM is the “gold standard” against which all the other audio codecs are compared.
This is because it represents uncompressed digital audio. Although, to say that Linear PCM
is uncompressed is a bit of a misnomer since, in fact, the audio data it represents is based on
quantized samples taken at regular periods across a given time interval, therefore some
information is lost in the process, depending on the bit depth and sampling frequency com-
pared to the original source. However, the 16-, 20- and 24-bit sample sizes and 48 to 192 kHz
sampling frequencies are generally considered to capture all of the fidelity that the human
ear is capable of hearing. So, we come back to the statement that it is uncompressed. In any
case, it is enough to say that Linear PCM is the starting point from which all of the other
audio codecs begin. Any divergence from the original set of Linear PCM samples would,
therefore, be considered error, noise, or distortion.
So, if Linear PCM is the gold standard, then why not just use it exclusively? The simple
answers are file size and bandwidth considerations. Large files generated by Linear PCM are
a concern, but it is the data rate of the format that primarily impacts the decision to use it or
some other audio format. Capturing Linear PCM audio involves taking a 16- to 24-bit sam-
ple of each audio channel at anywhere from 48,000 to 192,000 times each second. For stereo
audio, that corresponds with 1.536 to 9.216 million bits per second (Mbps). For standard 5.1
surround sound audio, the numbers jump up to 4.608 to 27.648 Mbps. Given that the maxi-
mum tramsport stream data rate for Blu-ray playout is 48 Mbps, it is easy to see that with
Linear PCM there may be insufficient capacity remaining for the video component.
Many of the first Blu-ray movie titles released in 2006 included Linear PCM surround
sound audio tracks as a standard feature, although those discs had few other features since
there was no space left for them on the single-layer 25 Gbyte discs used at that time.
Nonetheless, Linear PCM files are incredibly large, especially when compared to com-
pressed counterparts from Dolby and DTS. For applications in which the highest audio qual-
ity is required, Linear PCM should be considered. However, for other applications in which
audio is not the central concern and, perhaps, disc space or other features may be of greater
importance, using one of the compressed audio options is a very attractive alternative.

Dolby Digital (AC-3) Audio Coding
Dolby Digital audio compression (known as AC-3 in standards documents) provides for
up to 5.1 channels of discrete audio.18 One of the advantages of Dolby Digital is that it ana-
lyzes the audio signal to differentiate short, transient signals from long, continuous signals.
Short sample blocks are then used for short sounds and long sample blocks are used for
longer sounds. This results in smoother encoding without transient suppression and block
boundary effects that can occur with fixed block sizes. For compatibility with existing
audio/video systems, Dolby Digital decoders can downmix multichannel programs to ensure
that all the channels are present in their proper proportions for mono, stereo, or Dolby Pro
Logic reproduction.
Dolby Digital uses a frequency transform — somewhat like the DCT transform of JPEG
and MPEG — and groups the resulting values into frequency bands of varying widths to
match the critical bands of human hearing. Each transformed block is converted to a float-
ing-point frequency representation that is allocated a varying number of bits from a common
pool, according to the importance of the frequency band. The result is a constant bitrate
(CBR) data stream.
Dolby Digital also includes dynamic range information so that different listening environ-
ments can be compensated for. Original audio mixes, such as movie sound tracks, which are
designed for the wide dynamic range of a theater, can be encoded to maintain the clarity of
the dialogue and to enable emphasis of soft passages when played at low volume in the home.
Dolby Digital was developed from the ground up as a multichannel coder designed to
meet the diverse and often contradictory needs of consumer delivery. It also has a significant
lead over other multichannel systems in both marketing and standards adoption. Millions of
Dolby Digital decoders are in living rooms, and Dolby Digital was chosen for the U.S. DTV
(digital television) standard and is being used for digital satellite systems and most other dig-
ital television systems.
Dolby Digital Plus (DD+)
Dolby Digital Plus, also known as Enhanced AC-3, is an extension of Dolby Digital that
adds a number of features to the already popular codec. In particular, DD+ provides spec-
tral coding techniques that help to improve audio reproduction at very low data rates (such
as, for streaming applications), while adding a mechanism for supporting more discrete chan-
nels and higher data rates.
Unfortunately, Dolby Digital Plus comes with a few problems, as well. First, legacy A/V
receivers that support Dolby Digital via digital connections (e.g., S/PDIF) will not natively
support the decoding of Dolby Digital Plus. Fortunately, Dolby Digital Plus can address this
by down converting to legacy Dolby Digital at a high data rate (640 kbps) to preserve as much
of the DD+ quality as possible. If the Dolby Digital Plus stream to be converted contains
more than 5.1 channels of audio, the channels beyond 5.1 are discarded during the conver-

sion process, but due to the structure of the DD+ bitstream, the content from those chan-
nels is retained in the converted Dolby Digital stream by means of a downmix process that
occurs in the Dolby Digital Pus encoder during the production process. However, only the
5.1 downmix of streams originally with 6.1 or 7.1 channels will be heard.
Second, most of the extra features of Dolby Digital Plus have the greatest effect at very
low encoding rates rather than at the data rates one would typically expect on a Blu-ray disc.
DD+ is able to retain its level of perceptual quality at lower data rates, but in the moderate
and higher data rate ranges that are more consistent with what would be expected to be used
on a BD disc, the difference in quality between AC-3 and DD+ is actually quite small. Even
though DD+ can support data rates as high as 4.7 Mbps on BD, such high rates would offer
little perceived improvement to the audio experience in a 5.1-channel surround environment. 
Dolby TrueHD
For those who have followed DVD-Audio, Dolby TrueHD is a familiar technology under
a different name. Dolby TrueHD is, essentially, the marketing name Dolby Laboratories uses
for Meridian Lossless Packing (MLP), the lossless compression scheme developed by
Meridian Audio, Ltd., but licensed by Dolby Labs. MLP was the codec of choice preferred
by the recording industry for providing lossless audio compression on formats such as DVD-
Audio. Capable of delivering the exact same quality as uncompressed Linear PCM audio but
usually at much better compression rates, Dolby TrueHD provides an excellent alternative in
cases where disc space or bandwidth are a concern.
One important advantage that losslessly compressed codecs, such as, Dolby TrueHD and
DTS-HD Master Audio (defined in the following section) have over Linear PCM is the abil-
ity to include a lossless downmix in the stream. For example, an 8-channel Linear PCM
stream contains eight discrete audio channels that are all expected to be heard by the listen-
er. However, if your sound system only has six or even just two speakers, you will not be able
to hear the full Linear PCM presentation. A Dolby TrueHD 8-channel stream, however, is
required to also include both a 6-channel and a 2-channel downmix, each of which is loss-
lessly encoded. This has almost no impact on the data rate and file size, but provides for a
greatly improved listening experience no matter how many speakers you have.
One difficulty with Dolby TrueHD, however, is that it is a variable bitrate (VBR) coding
scheme. That means the data rate of the stream fluctuates over time depending on the com-
plexity of the audio being compressed. This can be a problem when the variable bitrate audio
is combined with variable bitrate video, which can lead to unexpected multiplexing issues due
to peak data rate overruns. In areas with intricate high frequency detail, which is difficult to
encode, the data rate of a stream may reach levels as high as an uncompressed Linear PCM
stream, while in other areas it may be dramatically lower. Although the Dolby TrueHD
encoder uses a complex scheme to minimize peak data rates, some peaks may be unavoid-
able. The operator cannot simply specify data rate limits as one would do for variable bitrate
video because doing so would require changing the audio data itself, making it no longer loss-
less. Because Dolby TrueHD is a lossless compression method (a key difference from VBR
video encoding), it can only ensure a lossless encode by being allowed to raise the data rate

to encode all of the audio perfectly. What’s more, the operator cannot predict what the range
of required data rates will be until after the stream has been encoded since it is entirely con-
tent dependent. This can turn the disc production process upside down if you do not know
how much bandwidth will be available for your video until after you are done encoding all of
your audio.
DTS and DTS-HD Audio Coding
Digital Theater Systems (DTS) Digital Surround uses the Coherent Acoustics differential
subband perceptual audio transform coder, which is similar to the Dolby Digital audio coder.
It uses polyphase filters to break the audio into subbands (usually 32) of varying bandwidths
and then uses ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) to compress each
subband. The ADPCM step is a linear predictive coding that “guesses” at the next value in
the sequence and then encodes only the difference. The prediction coefficients are quantized
based on psychoacoustic and transient analysis and then are variable-length coded using
entropy tables.
DTS decoders include downmixing features using either preset downmix coefficients or
custom coefficients embedded in the stream. Dynamic range control and other user data can
be included in the stream to be used in post-decoder processes.
The DTS Coherent Acoustics format used for discs is different from the format used in
theaters, which is Audio Processing Technology’s apt-X, a straight ADPCM coder with no
psychoacoustic modeling.
An addition to the statistically lossless group of codecs is the DTS-HD variable bitrate
(VBR) codec. Built on the existing DTS foundation, the DTS-HD codec takes a backward
compatible, hierarchical approach to implementing lossless compression. The encoded data
is composed of a normal DTS core plus an additional extension to achieve lossless compres-
sion.
Both DTS and DTS-HD are built upon the same Coherent Acoustics technology, which
defines a “core + extension” structure for audio coding. The core component is typically
composed of either 768 kbps or 1.509 Mbps 5.1-channel 48 kHz encoded audio. For DTS
audio, the coded audio is composed of a single core substream that contains the core audio
data plus zero or one optional extension. For DTS-HD, however, at least one extension sub-
stream exists, which can contain one or two extension units. A legacy DTS encoder only pays
attention to the core substream, while a new DTS-HD decoder will use both the core sub-
stream and the extension substream to provide an enhanced experience. The core substream
is essentially equivalent to the DTS audio that has been used in the past on DVD titles. The
new extension substream in DTS-HD is what allows it to transcend even that high quality
experience, providing additional channels (up to 7.1), lossless compression, increased sam-
pling rates (96 kHz, or 192 kHz for lossless encoding), and additional data rates (up to 24.5
Mbps).
The extensions supported by the legacy DTS codec include XCH and X96. The DTS-HD
codec adds XXCH, XBR and XLL.

XCH
The Channel Extension, XCH, provides an additional discrete mono channel for output as
a single or dual rear center channel, and is marketed under the name “DTS-ES®.” Many
legacy DTS decoders and A/V receivers support this extension when found in the core sub-
stream.
X96
The Sampling Frequency Extension, X96, also known as “Core+96k,” provides a method
for extending the sampling frequency of DTS audio from the standard 48 kHz up to 96 kHz.
An encoder using this extension will start by performing a standard DTS 48 kHz encode of
the core data, then decode that and subtract it from the original to determine which residu-
als were lost in the process. The X96 extension data is then generated by encoding these
residuals. As with XCH, many legacy decoders and A/V receivers support this extension
under the name “DTS-96/24™” (“24” refers to the 24-bit audio data that is output).
XXCH
Similar to the XCH Channel Extension, XXCH is a newer version that supports a greater
number of additional discrete channels. For Blu-ray, however, the number of additional
channels is limited to two, extending the core 5.1 channel configuration to 7.1 channels. Only
new decoders and A/V receivers that support DTS-HD directly will recognize this extension.
XBR
Like XXCH, the High Bit-Rate Extension, XBR, is an extension for DTS that provides
greater audio quality by increasing the available encoded data rate via the extension sub-
stream. In short, an encoder implementing the XBR extension would do so in a similar man-
ner to X96, above. First, the data is compressed using the core encoder to form the core sub-
stream. It is then immediately decoded and subtracted from the original audio data to cal-
culate the residuals that were “missed” by the core encoder. These residuals are then encod-
ed into the XBR extension in the extension substream, resulting in an overall increase in data
rate. When the core and XBR extension are later decoded and recombined, the result is a
more accurate reproduction of the original audio data. Like XXCH, only newer decoders
and A/V receivers that directly support DTS-HD will benefit from the XBR extension.
XLL
The Lossless Extension, XLL, is perhaps the most exciting extension to the DTS codec.
With the ability to perform lossless compression of up to eight channels of 24-bit audio at
sampling frequencies of up to 192 kHz, DTS-HD Master Audio promises to deliver all of the
quality of a Linear PCM stream at a fraction of the bandwidth and disc space. However, sup-
port for the XLL extension in Blu-ray players is only optional, and it requires a new A/V
receiver that supports DTS-HD Master Audio to decode it, and then only if it is able to
receive the extension substream from the player. Like the other variations, DTS-HD Master
Audio includes a DTS core 5.1 channel component that can be decoded even by legacy
devices.

Like Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio is a lossless compression scheme, which
means that every bit that is encoded from the original Linear PCM source audio will be
recreated at the decoder with exact precision. However, it should also be noted that both
compression methods have variable data rates that are content dependent. In other words,
some content, such as 24-bit audio with a lot of noise in the least significant bits, can require
significantly more bandwidth and disc space than other content. In extreme cases, this can
cause a DTS-HD Master Audio or Dolby TrueHD stream to take up nearly as much room as
an uncompressed Linear PCM stream, though this is quite rare. One recommended tech-
nique in such cases is to consider “bit shaving,” in which the least significant one or two bits
of the audio samples are removed (set to zero) prior to encoding. This often results in a
stream that is far more efficient to encode, while having little or no impact on the audio qual-
ity of the stream. In any case, this is a technique that the mastering engineer ought to per-
form, as is seen fit. It is not something the encoder itself would do, since it would no longer
be considered a lossless encode if this took place inside the encoder.
Speakers Everywhere
One of the key selling points for Blu-ray Disc is its support for discrete multichannel
audio. BD players paired with A/V receivers are able to deliver a compelling experience —
5.1 and 7.1 channel surround sound with a quality equivalent to (or better than) CD audio.
Interestingly, while a higher quality of video has usually been assumed to be the most com-
pelling feature by the creators of DVD and BD, it seems that a higher quality audio experi-
ence may be an even more significant motivating factor.
Most consumers, it seems, are familiar with the common 5.1 channel speaker setup, with
left (L), center (C), right (R), left surround (LS), and right surround (RS) speakers and low-
frequency effects subwoofer (LFE) arranged around the room. Now, with Blu-ray Disc, new
speaker configurations are appearing. For example, the 7.1-channel audio codecs allow for
multiple different speaker arrangements, including the standard 5.1 plus either two addi-
tional “center surround” speakers, or two additional surround side speakers, or two addi-
tional surround rear speakers, or height speakers to provide altitude to the exprience. In the
meantime, releases to the theaters rarely use a 7.1-channel mix, and many more standard
practices must be defined before these channel configurations take on greater significance.
A Few Timely Words about Jitter
Jitter is one of the most confusing aspects of digital video and audio, and this confusion car-
ries over to Blu-ray Disc. Even the experts disagree about its effects. Part of the problem is
that jitter means many things, most of them quite technical. Modern episodes of Star Trek
come closest to providing a comprehensive definition. Since it’s not very dramatic to say,
“Captain, we have detected jitter!” crew members instead say, “We have encountered a tem-
poral anomaly!” In general terms, jitter is inconsistency over time.

When most people speak of jitter, they mean time jitter, also called phase noise, which is a
time-base error in a clock signal — deviation from the perfectly spaced intervals of a refer-
ence signal. Figure 2.10 compares the simplified square wave of a perfect digital signal to the
same signal after being affected by factors such as poor-quality components or poorly
designed components, mismatched impedance in cables, logic-level mismatches between
integrated circuits (ICs), interference and fluctuations in power supply voltage, radiofrequen-
cy (RF) interference, and reflections in the signal path. The resulting signal contains aberra-
tions such as phase shift, high-frequency noise, triangle waves, clipping, rounding, slow
rise/fall, and ringing. The binary values of the signal are encoded in the transition from pos-
itive voltage to negative voltage, and vice versa. In the distorted signal, the transitions no
longer occur at regularly spaced intervals.
However, looking closely at Figure 2.10 reveals something interesting. Even though the
second signal is misshapen to the point of displacing the transition points, the sequence of
ones and zeros is still reconstructed correctly, since each transition is within the interval tim-
ing window. In other words, there is no data loss, and there is no error. The timing informa-
tion is distorted, but it can be fixed. This is the key to understanding the difference between
correctable and uncorrectable jitter. In the digital domain, jitter is almost always inconse-
quential. Minor phase errors are easily corrected by resynchronizing the data. Of course,
large amounts of jitter can cause data errors, but most systems specify jitter tolerances at lev-
els far below the error threshold.19
Jitter is an interface phenomenon — it only becomes a problem when moving from the
analog to the digital world or from the digital world to the analog world. For example, jitter
in the sampling clock of an analog-to-digital converter causes uneven spacing of the samples,
which results in a distorted measurement of the waveform (Figure 2.11). On the other end
of the chain, jitter in a digital-to-analog converter causes voltage levels to be generated at

19The AES/EBU standard for serial digital audio specifies a 163 ns clock rate with ±20 ns of jitter. The full 40
ns range is 24 percent of the unit interval. Testing has shown that correct data values are received with band-
widths as low as 400 kHz. Jitter in the recovered clock is reduced with wider bandwidths up to 5 MHz. The
CD Orange Book specifies a maximum of 35 ns of jitter, but also recommends that total jitter in the readout
system be less then 10 percent of the unit interval (that is, 23 ns out of 230 ns). The DVD-ROM specification
states that jitter must be less than 8 percent of the channel bit clock period (8 percent of 38 ns comes to
approximately 3 ns of jitter). In BD, layer 0 jitter must be less than 0.98 ns (6.5 percent of the 15 ns channel
clock period) and layer 1 jitter must be less than 1.28 ns (8.5 percent).

incorrect moments in time, resulting in audio waveform distortions such as spurious tones
and added noise, producing what is often described as a “harsh” sound. Jitter that passes into
an analog speaker signal degrades spatial image, ambience, and dynamic range. Actual data
errors produce clicks or pops or periods of silence.
In some cases there is nothing you can do about jitter (other than buy better equipment).
In other cases, power conditioners and high-quality cables with good shielding reduce certain
kinds of jitter. Before you do anything, however, it is important to understand the various
types of jitter and which ones are worth worrying about. Many a shrewd marketer has capi-
talized on the fears of consumers worried about jitter and sonic quality, bestowing on the
world such products as colored ink that supposedly reduces reflections from the edge of the
disc, disc stabilizer rings that claim to reduce rotational variations, foil stickers alleged to pro-
duce “morphic resonance” to rebalance human perception, highly damped rubber feet or
hardwood stabilizer cones for players, cryogenic treatments, disc polarizing devices, and
other technological nostrums that are intimate descendents of Dr. Feelgood’s Amazing
Curative Elixir.
Basically, five types of jitter are relevant to DVD and BD20 —
j Oscillator jitter
Oscillating quartz crystals are used to generate clock signals
for digital circuitry. The quality of the crystal and the purity of the voltage dri-
ving it determine the stability of the clock signal. Oscillator jitter is a factor in
other types of jitter, since all clocks are “fuzzy” to some degree.
j Sampling jitter (recording jitter)
This is the most critical type of jitter. When
the analog signal is being digitized, instability in the clock results in the wrong
samples being taken at the wrong time (see Figure 2.11). Reclocking at a later
point can fix the time errors but not the amplitude sampling errors. There is
nothing the consumer can do about jitter that happens at recording time or

Figure 2.11  Effects of Sampling Jitter
20One particular phenomenon is incorrectly referred to as jitter. When optical drives perform digital audio
extraction (DAE) from audio CDs, they can run into problems if the destination drive cannot keep up with the
data flow. Most drives do not have block-accurate seeking, so they may miss or duplicate a small amount of
data after a pause. These data errors cause clicks when the audio is played back. This is colloquially referred
to as “jitter,” and there are software packages that perform “jitter correction” by comparing successive read
passes during DAE, but technically this is not jitter. It’s a data error, not a phase error.

during production, because it becomes a permanent part of the recording.
Sampling jitter also occurs when the analog signal from a player is sent to a dig-
ital processor (such as an AV receiver with DSP features or a video line multi-
plier). The quality of the DAC in the receiving equipment determines the
amount of sampling jitter. Using a digital connection instead of an analog con-
nection avoids the problem altogether.
j Media jitter (pit jitter)
This type of jitter is not critical. During disc replication,
a laser beam is used to cut the pattern of pits in the glass master. Any jitter in
the clock or physical vibration in the mechanism used to drive the laser will be
transmitted to the master and thus to every disc that is molded from it.
Variations in the physical replication process also can contribute to pits being
longer or shorter than they should be. These variations are usually never large
enough to cause data errors, and each disc is tested for data integrity at the end
of the production line. Media jitter can be worse with recorded discs because
they are subject to surface contamination, dust, and vibration during recording.
Strange as it may seem, however, recorded media usually have cleaner and
more accurate pit geometry than pressed media. However, with both pressed
and recorded discs, the minor effects of jitter have no effect on the actual data.
j Readout jitter (transport jitter)
This type of jitter has little or no effect on the
final signal. As the disc spins, phase-locked circuits monitor the modulations of
the laser beam to maintain proper tracking, focus, and disc velocity. As these
parameters are adjusted, the timing of the incoming signal fluctuates. Media
jitter adds additional perturbations. Despite readout jitter, error correction cir-
cuitry verifies that the data is read correctly. Actual data errors are extremely
rare. The data is buffered into RAM, where it is clocked out by an internal crys-
tal. In theory, the rest of the system should be unaffected by readout jitter
because an entirely new clock is used to regenerate the signal.
j Interface jitter (data-link jitter)
This type of jitter may be critical or it may be
harmless, depending on the destination component. When data is transmitted
to another device, it must be modulated onto an electrical or optical carrier sig-
nal. Many factors in the transmission path (such as cable quality) can induce
random timing deviations in the interface signal (see Figure 2.10). There is also
signal-correlated jitter, where the characteristics of the signal itself cause distor-
tions. As a result of interface jitter, values are still correct (as long as the jitter
is not severe enough to cause data errors), but they are received at the wrong
time. If the receiving component is a digital recorder that simply stores the
data, interface jitter has no effect. If the receiving component uses the signal
directly to generate audio and does not sufficiently attenuate the jitter, it may
cause audible distortion.21 A partial solution is to use shorter cables or cables
with more bandwidth and to properly match impedance.

21For example, a string of ones or a string of zeros may travel faster or slower than a varying sequence
because the transmission characteristics of the cable are not uniform across the signal frequency range.

To restate the key point, when the component that receives a signal is designed only to
transfer or store the data, it need only recover the data, not the clock, so jitter below the error
threshold has no effect. This is why digital copies can be made with no errors. However, when
the component receiving a signal must reconstruct the analog waveform, then it must recov-
er the clock as well as the data. In this case, the equipment should reduce jitter as much as
possible before regenerating the signal. The problem is that there is a tradeoff between data
accuracy and jitter reduction. Receiver circuitry designed to minimize data errors sacrifices
jitter attenuation.22 The ultimate solution is to decouple the data from the clock. Some man-
ufacturers have approached this goal by putting the master clock in the DAC (which is prob-
ably the best place for it) and having it drive the servo mechanism and readout speed of the
drive. RAM-buffered time-base correction in the receiver is another option. This reclocks
incoming bits by letting them pile up in a line behind a digital gate that opens and closes to
release them in a retimed sequence. This technique removes incoming jitter but introduces
a delay in the signal. The accuracy of the gate determines how much new jitter is created.
The quality of digital interconnect cables makes a difference, but only to a point. The more
bandwidth in the cable, the less jitter is introduced. Note that a digital audio cable is actual-
ly transmitting an analog electrical or optical signal. There is a digital to analog conversion
step at the transmitter and an analog to digital conversion step at the receiver. That is the
reason interface jitter can be a problem. However, the problem is less serious than when an
analog interface cable is used because no resampling of analog signal values occurs.
Much ado is made about high-quality transports — disc readers that minimize jitter to
improve audio and video quality. High-end systems often separate the transport unit from
other units, which ironically introduces a new source of jitter in the interface cable. Jitter
from the transport is a function of the oscillator, the internal circuitry, and the signal output
transmitter. In theory, media jitter and transport jitter should be irrelevant but, in reality, the
oscillator circuitry is often integrated into a larger chip, so leakage can occur between cir-
cuits. It is also possible for the servo motors to cause fluctuations in the power supply that
affect the crystal oscillator, especially if they are working extra hard to read a suboptimal
disc. Other factors such as instability in the oscillator crystal, temperature, and physical vibra-
tion may introduce jitter. A jitter-free receiver changes everything. If the receiver reclocks
the signal, you can use the world’s cheapest transport and get better quality than with an out-
rageously expensive, vacuum-sealed, hydraulically cushioned transport with a titanium-lead
chassis. The reason better transports produce perceptibly better results is that most receivers
do not reclock or otherwise sufficiently attenuate interface jitter. Even digital receivers with
DSP (digital signal processing) circuitry usually operate directly on the bitstream without
reclocking it.
Interface jitter affects all digital signals coming from a player — PCM audio, Dolby
Digital, DTS, and so on. In order to stay in sync with the video, the receiver must lock the
decoder to the clock in the incoming signal. Since the receiver depends on the timing infor-
mation recovered from the incoming digital audio signal, it is susceptible to timing jitter.

22The jitter tolerance characteristic of a PLL (phase-locked loop) circuit is inversely proportional to its jitter
attenuation characteristic. The more “slack” the circuit allows in signal transition timing, the more jitter passes
through. This situation can be improved by using two PLLs to create a two-stage clock recovery circuit.

There is an ongoing tug of war between engineers and critical listeners. The engineers
claim to have produced a jitterless system, but golden ears hear a difference. After enough
tests, the engineers discover that jitter is getting through somewhere or being added some-
where, and they go back to the drawing board. Eventually, the engineers will win the game.
Until then, it’s important to recognize that most sources of jitter have little or no perceptible
effect on the audio or video.
Pegs and Holes: Understanding Aspect Ratios
The introduction of high definition television and widescreen displays has taken the sub-
ject of aspect ratios to an entirely new level. Yet, we are still, and will be for some time, deal-
ing with standard definition televisions. This section describes the various cinematic and tele-
vision system approaches to presentation on standard definition displays. The following sec-
tions address the issues of widescreen displays and their aspect ratio.
The standard television picture is a specific rectangular shape — a third again wider than
it is high. This aspect ratio is designated as 4:3, or 4 units wide by 3 units high, also expressed
as 1.33.23 This rectangular shape is a fundamental part of the NTSC and PAL television sys-
tems — it cannot be changed without redefining the standards and reengineering the equip-
ment.24
The problem is that movies are generally wider than television screens. Most movies are
1.85 (about 5.5:3). Extra wide movies in the Panavision or Cinemascope format are around
2.35 (about 7:3). The conundrum is how to fit a wide movie shape into a not-so-wide televi-
sion shape (see Figure 2.12).
Fitting a movie into standard television is like the old puzzle of putting a square peg in a
round hole, but in this case it is a rectangular peg and a rectangular hole. Consider a peg that
is twice as wide as the hole (see Figure 2.13). There are, essentially, three ways that have been
developed to get the peg in the hole —
1. Shrink the peg to half its original size or make the hole twice as big (see Figure 2.14).
2. Slice off part of the peg (see Figure 2.15).
3. Squeeze the peg from the sides until it is the same shape as the hole (see Figure 2.16).

23There’s no special meaning to the numbers 4 and 3. They are simply the smallest whole numbers that can
be used to represent the ratio of width to height. An aspect ratio of 12:9 is the same as 4:3. The ratio can be
normalized to a height of 1, but the width becomes the repeating fraction 1.33333..., which is why the 4:3
notation is generally used. For comparison purposes it is useful to use the normalized format of 1.33:1 or 1.33
for short. On occasion, people will mention the “Academy Aperture” ratio of 1.37. In 1927, the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences officially chose 1.33 as the industry standard. In 1931 it was changed to
1.37 to allow room on the film for a soundtrack. From the 1920s to the early 1950s almost all films were shot
at 1.37, providing a picture aspect ratio of 1.33.
24The next generation of television — known as HDTV, ATV, DTV, etc.— has a 1.78 (16:9) picture that is
much wider than standard television. However, the new digital format is incompatible with the old standard
recording and display equipment.

Now, think of the peg as a movie and the hole as a TV. The first two peg-and-hole solu-
tions are used commonly to show movies on television. Quite often you will see horizontal
black bars at the top and bottom of the picture. This means that the width of the movie shape
has been matched to the width of the TV shape, leaving a gap at the top and the bottom. This
is called letterboxing. It does not refer to postal pugilism but rather to the process of putting
the movie in a black box with a hole the shape of a standard paper envelope. The black bars
are called mattes.
At other times you might see the words, “This presentation has been formatted for televi-
sion”, at the beginning of a movie. This indicates that a pan and scan process has been used,
where a TV-shaped window over the film image is panned from side to side, scanned up and
down, or zoomed in and out (see Figures 2.17 and 2.18). This process is more complicated
than just chopping off a little from each side; sometimes the important part of the picture is
entirely or primarily on one side, and sometimes there is more picture on the film above or
below what is shown in the theater, so the person who transfers the movie to video must
determine for every scene how much of each side should be chopped off or how much addi-
tional picture from above or below should be included in order to preserve the action and
story line. For the past 20 years or so, most films have been shot flat, sometimes called soft
matte. The cinematographer has two rectangles in the viewfinder, one for 1.85 (or wider) and
one for 4:3. He or she composes the shots to look good in the 1.85 rectangle while making
sure that no crew, equipment, or raw set edges are visible above or below in the 4:3 area.

For presentation in the theater, a theatrical matte or aperture plate is used to mask off the
top and bottom when the film is printed or projected. When the movie is transferred to video
for 4:3 presentation, the full frame is available for the pan and scan (and zoom) process.25 In
many cases, the director of photography or the director approves the transfer to ensure that
the integrity of the film is maintained. Full control over how the picture is reframed is very
important. For example, when the mattes are removed, close-up shots become medium
shots, and the frame may need to be zoomed in to recreate the intimacy of the original shot.
In a sense, the film is being composed anew for the new aspect. The pan and scan process
has the disadvantage of losing some of the original picture but is able to make the most of
the 4:3 television screen and is able to enlarge the picture to compensate for the smaller size
and lower resolution as compared with a theater screen.
There is another option that applies only to computer-generated films. The shots can be
recomposed for 4:3 presentation by moving characters and objects closer together. The story,
action, and sound all remain the same, but the movie is re-rendered to fit the dimensions of
standard TVs.
The third peg-and-hole solution has been used for years to fit widescreen movies onto
standard 35-mm film. As filmmakers tried to enhance the theater experience with ever wider
screens, they needed some way to get the image on the film without requiring new wider film
and new projectors in every theater. They came up with the anamorphic process, where the
camera is fitted with an anamorphic lens that squeezes the picture horizontally, changing its
shape so that it fits into a standard film frame. The projector is fitted with a lens that
unsqueezes the image when it is projected (see Figure 2.19). It is as if the peg were accor-
dion-shaped so that it can be squeezed into the square hole and then pop back into shape
after it is removed. You may have seen this distortion effect at the end of a Western movie
where John Wayne suddenly becomes tall and skinny so that the credits will fit between the
edges of the television screen.
Figure 2.20 depicts the aspect ratio considerations when presenting images on standard
television displays and widescreen display. Depending on the method of acquisition (1.33 or
1.85), the scene can be presented in a myriad of permutations.
Widescreen Displays
In recent years, we have seen a marked transition to widescreen and high definition dis-
plays. Display manufacturers have jumped on the February 2009 digital television switchover,
and are producing widescreen displays in a diverse array of models and technologies. We
have gone from a world dominated by cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to one in which it will soon
be difficult to find a CRT model display. Although the CRT is fading from the landscape, it
should not be dismissed too quickly.
Widescreen displays are quite flexible in the way they deal with different input formats.
Widescreen displays present images in a 16:9 aspect ratio and, generally, this accommodates

ratio, with no extra picture at the top or bottom.

high definition format presentations. They can also display 4:3 video with black bars on the
sides — a kind of sideways letterbox that is sometimes called a pillarbox — and they also have
display modes that enlarge the 4:3 video to fill their entire screen —
j Wide mode stretches the picture horizontally (see Figure 2.21). This is some-
times called full mode. This is the proper mode to use with anamorphic video,
but it makes everything look short and fat when applied to 4:3 video. Some
widescreen TVs have a parabolic or panorama version of wide mode, which uses
nonlinear distortion to stretch the sides more and the center less, thus minimiz-
ing the apparent distortion. This mode should not be used with anamorphic
DVD output or very strange fun-house-mirror effects will occur.
j Expand mode proportionally enlarges the picture to fill the width of the screen,
thus losing the top and bottom (see Figure 2.22). This is sometimes called the-
ater mode. Expand mode is for use with letterboxed video because it effectively
removes the mattes. If used with standard 4:3 picture, this mode causes a Henry
VIII “off with their heads” effect.
When DVD contains widescreen video and is played in a DVD player, the different out-
put modes of the player can be combined with different widescreen TV display modes to cre-
ate a confusing array of options. Figure 2.20 shows how the different DVD output modes
look on a regular TV and on a widescreen TV. Note that there is one “good” way to view
widescreen video on a standard TV (Figure 2.20e) but that a very large TV or a widescreen
TV is required to do it justice. Also note that there is only one good way to view widescreen
video on a widescreen TV, and this is with widescreen (anamorphic) output to wide mode
(Figure 2.20o).
Neither the Wide or the Expand modes should be used with Blu-ray players, as the player
outputs a true widescreen picture. In cases where the disc contains standard definition 4:3
video (either 720×480 or 720×576) the player will center the image on the 16:9 display, or

for anamorphic video (high definition 1440×1080 or standard definition) the player will
expand the image to fit the 16:9 display.
Clearly, it is easy to display the wrong picture in the wrong way. In some cases, the equip-
ment is smart enough to assist. The player can send a special signal embedded in the video
blanking area or via the connector to the widescreen TV, but everything must be set up prop-
erly. If everything is working correctly and the TV is equipped to recognize widescreen sig-
naling, it will automatically switch modes to match the format of the video.
Video comes out of a player in, basically, one of five ways —
1. Full frame 4:3 original
2. Pan and scan (widescreen original)
3. Full frame 16:9 original
3. Letterbox (widescreen original)
4. Anamorphic (widescreen original)
All five can be displayed on any TV, but the third, fourth and fifth modes are specifically
intended for widescreen TVs. This may seem straightforward, but it becomes much more
complicated. The problem is that very few movies are in 16:9 (1.78) format. Although, a
great proportion of video is now being created in 16:9 format as 16:9 HD cameras are being
more widely used.
Most movies are usually 1.85 or wider, although European movies are often 1.66. DVD
and Blu-ray Disc support aspect ratios of 1.33 (4:3) and 1.78 (16:9) because they are the two
most common television shapes. Movies that are a different shape must be made to fit, which
brings us back to pegs and holes. In this case, the hole is the 16:9 shape. There are essential-
ly four ways to fit a 1.85 or wider movie peg into a 1.78 hole —
j Letterbox to 16:9
Perhaps the most common approach, when the movie is
transferred from film, black mattes are added to box it into the 16:9 shape.
These mattes become a permanent part of the picture. The position and thick-
ness of the mattes depend on the shape of the original.
j For a 1.85 movie, the mattes are relatively small. On a widescreen TV the
mattes are hidden in the overscan area.26
j For a 2.35 movie, the permanent mattes are much thicker. In this case, the
picture has visible mattes no matter how it is displayed.
j For a 1.66 movie, thin mattes are placed on the sides instead of at the top
and bottom and may be hidden in the overscan area of a display.
j Crop to 16:9
For 1.85 movies, slicing 2 percent from each side is sufficient and
probably will not be noticeable. The same applies to 1.66 movies, except that
about 3 percent is sliced off the top and off the bottom, but to fit a 2.35 movie

26Overscan refers to covering the edges of the picture area with a mask around the screen. Overscan was
originally implemented to hide distortion at the edges. Television technology has improved to the point where
overscan isn’t usually necessary, but it is still used. Most televisions have an overscan of about 4 to 5 per-
cent. Anyone producing video intended for television display must be mindful of overscan, making sure that
nothing important is at the edge of the picture. It should be noted that when DVD-Video or Blu-ray Disc con-
tent is displayed on a computer there is no overscan and the entire picture is visible.

requires slicing 12 percent from each side. This Procrustean approach throws
away a quarter of the picture and is not likely to be a popular solution.
j Pan and scan to 16:9
The standard pan and scan technique can be used with
a 16:9 window (as opposed to a 4:3 window) when transferring from film to dig-
ital video. For 1.85 movies, the result is essentially the same as cropping and is
hardly worth the extra work. For wider movies, pan and scan is more useful, but
the original aspect ratio is lost, which goes against the spirit of a widescreen for-
mat. When going to the trouble of supporting a widescreen format, it seems
silly to pan and scan inside it, but if the option is there, someone is bound to
use it.
j Open the soft matte to 16:9
When going from 1.85 to 16:9 (1.78), a small
amount of picture from the top and bottom of the full-frame film area can be
included. This stays close to the original aspect ratio without requiring a matte,
and the extra picture will be hidden in the overscan area on a widescreen TV
or when panned and scanned by the player. Even wider movies are usually shot
full frame, so the soft matte area can be included in the transfer (see Figure
2.23).
Why 16:9?
The 16:9 ratio has become the standard for widescreen. Most widescreen televisions are
this shape, it’s the aspect ratio used by almost all high-definition television standards, and it’s
the widescreen aspect ratio used by DVD and BD. You may be wondering why this ratio was
chosen, since it does not match television, movies, computers, or any other format. But this
is exactly the problem: there is no standard aspect ratio (see Figure 2.24).
Current display technology is limited to fixed physical sizes. A television picture tube must
be built in a certain shape, while a flat-panel display screen must be made with a certain num-
ber of pixels. Even a video projection system is limited by electronics and optics to project a
certain shape. These constraints will remain with us for decades until we progress to new
technologies such as scanning lasers or amorphous holographic projectors. Until then, a sin-
gle aspect ratio must be chosen for a given display. The cost of a television tube is based

roughly on diagonal measurement (taking into account the glass bulb, the display surface,
and the electron beam deflection circuitry), but the wider a tube is, the harder it is to main-
tain uniformity (consistent intensity across the display) and convergence (straight horizontal
and vertical lines). Therefore, too wide a tube is not desirable.
The 16:9 aspect ratio was chosen in part because it is an exact multiple of 4:3. Going from
4:3 to 16:9 merely entails adding one horizontal pixel for every three and going from 16:9 to
4:3 requires simply removing one pixel from every four.27 This makes the scaling circuitry for
letterbox and pan and scan functions much simpler and cheaper. It also makes the resulting
picture cleaner.
The 16:9 aspect ratio is also a reasonable compromise between television and movies. It’s
very close to 1.85 and it is close to the mean of 1.33 and 2.35. That is, 4/3 × 4/3 × 4/3 ~=
2.35. Choosing a wider display aspect ratio, such as 2:1, would have made 2.35 movies look
wonderful but would have required huge mattes on the side when showing as 4:3 video (as in
Figure 2.20f, but even wider).
Admittedly, the extra space could be used for picture outside picture (POP, the converse
of PIP), but it would be very expensive extra space. To make a 2:1 display the same height as

27In each case a weighted scaling function generally is used. For example, when going from 4 to 3 pixels, 3/4
of the first pixel is combined with 1/4 of the second to make the new first, 1/2 of the second is combined with
1/2 of the third to make the new second, and 1/4 of the third is combined with 3/4 of the fourth to make the
new third. This kind of scaling causes the picture to become slightly softer but is generally preferable to the
cheap alternative of simply throwing away every fourth line. Similar weighted averages can be used when
going from 3 to 4.
Figure 2.24  Common Aspect Ratios

a 35-inch television (21 inches) requires a width of 42 inches, giving a diagonal measure of
47 inches. In other words, to keep the equivalent 4:3 image size of 35-inch television, you
must get a 47-inch 2:1 television. Figure 2.25 shows additional widescreen display sizes
required to maintain the same height of common television sizes.
Figure 2.26 demonstrates the area of the display used when different image shapes are let-
terboxed to fit it (that is, the dimensions are equalized in the largest direction to make the
smaller box fit inside the larger box).28 The 1.33 row makes it clear how much smaller a let-
terboxed 2.35:1 movie is: only 57 percent of the screen is used for the picture. On the other
hand, the 2:1 row makes it clear how much expensive screen space goes unused by a 4:3 video
program or even a 1.85:1 movie. The two middle rows are quite similar, so the mathematical
relationship of 16:9 to 4:3 gives it the edge.
In summary, the only way to support multiple aspect ratios without mattes would be to use
a display that can physically change shape — a “mighty morphin’ television.” Since this is cur-
rently impossible (or, if possible, outrageously expensive as with motorized masks that
change the shape of fancy home theater projection screens), 16:9 is the most reasonable com-
promise. That said, the designers of DVD and BD could have improved things slightly by
allowing more than one anamorphic distortion ratio. If a 2.35 movie were stored using a 2.35
anamorphic squeeze, then 24 percent of the internal picture would not be wasted on the
black mattes, and the player could automatically generate the mattes for either 4:3 or 16:9
displays. This was not done, probably because of the extra cost and complexity it would add

28If you wanted to get the most for your money when selecting a display aspect ratio, you would need to
equalize the diagonal measurement of each display because the cost is roughly proportional to the diagonal
size. This approach is sometimes used when comparing display aspect ratios and letterboxed images, and it
has the effect of emphasizing the differences. The problem is that wider displays end up being shorter (for
example, a 2:1 display normalized to the same diagonal as a 4:3 display would be 4.47:2.25, which is 12 per-
cent wider but 25 percent shorter). In reality, no one would be happy with a new widescreen TV that was
shorter than their existing TV. Therefore, it is expected that a widescreen TV will have a larger diagonal mea-
surement and will cost more.

to the player. The limited set of aspect ratios presently supported by the MPEG-2 standard
(4:3, 16:9, and 2.21:1) also may have had something to do with it.
The Transfer Tango
Most Blu-ray Disc video is in native widescreen resolution. However, the Blu-ray specifi-
cation does allow for 144031080 anamorphic high definition video and standard definition
anamorphic video. So, the option still remains to transfer a 1.85 movie to a 4:3 aspect ratio
instead of 16:9, thus creating a pillarbox presentation when viewing on widescreen. At first
glance, there may seem to be no advantage in doing this because 1.85 movies are so close to
16:9 (1.78). It seems simpler to do a 16:9 transfer and let the player create a letterbox or pan
and scan version, when viewing on a 4:3 display. However, there are disadvantages to having
the player automatically format a widescreen movie for 4:3 display — the vertical resolution
suffers by 25 percent, the letterbox mattes are visible on movies wider than 1.85, and the play-
er is limited to lateral motion. In addition, many movie people are averse to what they con-
sider as surrendering creative control to the player. Therefore, almost every pan and scan
transfer is done in the studio and not enabled in the player. During the transfer from film to
video, the engineer has the freedom to use the full frame or to zoom in for closer shots, which
is especially handy when a microphone or a piece of the set is visible at the edge of the shot.
Many directors are violently opposed to pan and scan disfigurement of their films.
Director Sydney Pollack sued a Danish television station for airing a pan and scan version of
his Three Days of the Condor, which was filmed in 2.35 Cinemascope. Pollack felt strongly that
the pan and scan version infringed his artistic copyright. He believed that, “The director’s job
is to tell the film story, and the basis for doing this is to choose what the audience is supposed
to see, and not just generally but exactly what they are to see.” Some directors, such as
Stanley Kubrick, accept only the original aspect ratio. Others, such as James Cameron, who
closely supervise the transfer process from full-frame film, feel that the director is responsi-
ble for making the pan and scan transfer a viable option by recomposing the movie to make
the most of the 4:3 TV shape.

Figure 2.26  Relative Display Sizes for Letterbox Display

About two-thirds of widescreen movies are filmed using a 1.85 aspect ratio. When a 1.85
film is transferred directly to full-frame 4:3 by including the extra picture at the top and bot-
tom, the actual size of the images on the TV are the same as for a letterbox version. In other
words, letterboxing only covers the part of the picture that also was covered in the theater.
A pan and scan transfer to 4:3 makes the “I didn’t pay good money for my 30-inch TV just
to watch black bars” crowd happy, but a letterbox transfer to 16:9 is still needed to appease
the videophiles who demand the theatrical aspect ratio and to keep the “I paid good money
for my widescreen TV” crowd from revolting. As widescreen TVs replace traditional TVs,
4:3 transfers will become less common, and even letterboxed 4:3 transfers will become more
appreciated.
More on Interlaced vs. Progressive Scanning
One of the biggest problems facing early television designers was displaying images fast
enough to achieve a smooth illusion of motion. Early video hardware was simply not fast
enough to provide the required flicker fusion frequency of around 50 or 60 frames per sec-
ond. The ingenious expedient solution was to cut the amount of information in half by alter-
nately transmitting every other line of the picture (see Figure 2.27). The engineers counted
on the persistence of the phosphors in the television tube to make the two pictures blur into
one. This approach to image presentation is continued with the high definition format of
1080 lines, first the 540 odd lines are sent and displayed, followed by the 540 even lines. This
is called interlaced scanning. Each half of a frame is called a field.
The alternative approach, progressive scanning, displays every line of a complete frame in
one sweep. Progressive scanning requires twice the frequency in order to achieve the same
refresh rate. Progressive scan monitors have generally been used for computers since their
introduction. And progressive scanning is also used for HDTV.
Progressive scan provides a superior picture, overcoming many disadvantages of inter-
laced scanning. In interlaced scanning, small details, especially thin horizontal lines, appear
only in every other field. This causes a disturbing flicker effect, which you can see when
someone on TV is wearing stripes. The flicker problem is especially noticeable when com-
puter video signals are converted and displayed on a standard TV. In addition to flicker, line
crawl occurs when vertical motion matches the scanning rate. Interlaced scanning also caus-

es problems when the picture is paused. If objects in the video are moving, they end up in a
different position in each field. When two fields are shown together in a freeze-frame, the
picture appears to shake.
Film transfer processes are now capable of producing 24 frames per second (fps) masters
that are recorded to server and hard drive arrays. (Thie film may have been shot or telecined
at 23.976, but we will use 24 fps for both cases.) By eliminating a videotape recording from
the transfer process, the native film rate is preserved and allows the encoding process to
smoothly move to an encoded video stream that can be presented at the 24 frames per sec-
ond rate. Some widescreen displays are capable of reproducing the 24p fps imagery which, in
virtually all instances, requires an HDMI connection between player and display. See Chapter
7, Players, for more information about HDMI.
The 24 fps transfer process precludes the tedious and error-fraught method of generating
a transfer master that accommodates display at the 59.94 frame rate of standard televisions.
That, however, does not exempt the likely display of the encoded footage at that ol’ bugaboo
rate of 60 video fields per second. (Yes, we’ve again taken the low road and used “60” when
it’s really 59.94.)
Further, for legacy films that had previously been transferred to videotape, a transfer
method was instituted that took the film running at 24 progressive frames per second (fps)
and displayed it at the rate of 60 video fields per second. This is done with a film telecine
machine using a process called 2-3 pulldown, where one film frame is shown as two fields, and
the following film frame is shown as three fields (see Figure 2.28).
This 2-3 pulldown pattern results in pairs of 24-per-second film frames converted to 60-
per-second TV fields ([2+3]×12=60). Unfortunately, this causes side effects. One is that
film frame display times alternate between 2/60 of a second and 3/60 of a second, causing a
motion judder artifact — a jerkiness that may be visible when the camera pans slowly.
Another side effect is that two of every five television frames contain fields derived from two
different film frames, which does not cause problems during normal playback but can cause
problems when pausing or playing in slow motion. A minor problem is that video actually
plays at 59.94 Hz, so the film runs 0.1 percent slow and the audio must be adjusted to match.
Displaying film at the rate of 50 video fields per second is simpler and usually is achieved by
showing each film frame as two fields and playing it 4 percent faster.30 This is sometimes
called 2-2 pulldown, and is used extensively in PAL countries, where 25 fps is the norm.
When an encoder processes video made with 2-3 pulldown, it would be inefficient to
encode the extra fields, so the encoder recognizes and removes the duplicate fields. This is
called inverse telecine (no, it’s not called 3–2 pushup). But, when the goal is to present 24p
material on a 59.94 display, the encoder adds flags in the data stream that indicate which
fields to show when and which fields to repeat when. The encoder sets the repeat_first_field
flag on every fifth field, which instructs the decoder to repeat the field, thus recreating the
2–3 pulldown sequence needed to display the video on an interlaced TV. In other words, the
decoder in the player performs 2-3 pulldown, but only by following the instructions in the
data stream.

30Since the video is sped up 4 percent when played, the audio must be adjusted before it is encoded. In
many cases the audio speedup causes a semitone pitch shift that the average viewer will not notice. A better
solution is to digitally shift the pitch back to the proper level during the speedup process.

New Display Technologies
In recent years, there has been a dramatic expansion in the area of new display technolo-
gies. We have gone from a world dominated by cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to one in which it
will soon be difficult to find one. With advances in these new display technologies, it is impor-
tant to understand how Blu-ray and DVD are affected.
If you go down to your local consumer electronics store, you will see that standard defin-
ition televisions have all but disappeared, and there is a wide array of widescreen high defi-
nition displays available. Most standard televisions are of the CRT genre and although there
are a small number of CRT widescreen televisions still available, most widescreen displays
are either plasma or LCD. The leading reason for this differentiation is size. It is very diffi-
cult to manufacture a glass tube CRT at very large sizes. Given that the CRT is a type of vac-
uum tube technology, the tube itself must be able to structurally withstand the pressure of
containing a vacuum without imploding. As the tube grows larger, this becomes more diffi-
cult without any sort of internal support. Additionally, it’s a lot of glass, making it expensive
and, more importantly, HEAVY.
Does that mean CRT is going away? Almost, but not completely. It’s true that a 500+
pound CRT television will have a difficult time competing against the convenience of a rela-
tively light, wall-mounted plasma screen or LCD. Even in situations where taking up a large

space is not a problem, the convenience of a lightweight DLP system may outweigh (pun
intended) the CRT heavyweight. However, it will be a shame to lose CRTs. For one thing,
there has been over 60 years of research applied to developing the color display technologies
that CRT uses, including phosphors, screen masks and color dot distribution to name a few.
However, as the new technologies mature, considerable improvements have been made that
are proving to make the good ol’ CRTs relics of a bygone era.
Types of New Displays
Digital light processing (DLP) This type of display is based on the digital micromirror device
(DMD), a silicon chip whose surface is covered by a matrix of tiny mirrors. Through electri-
cal signals, these mirrors can toggle from an “off” position to an “on” position and back.
Basically, each micromirror represents a pixel; by reflecting a light source off the mirror, one
can project a black and white image. Flickering the mirror at variable high rates creates the
impression of varying amounts of light, thereby displaying a grayscale. Passing the image
through a rotating color wheel that is properly synchronized with the mirror flashes gener-
ates a color display. This is the basis for most consumer rear-projection DLP televisions,
which can offer a bright, crisp picture. However, depending on the color wheels used and the
sophistication of the display logic, DLP displays tend to have difficulty reproducing some of
the darker color ranges. Likewise, being a rear-projection device, there may be some light
bleed, which can wash out the image, making black areas appear gray. Some DLP displays
may exhibit color shift problems, exaggerated sharpness, and excessive brightness. The latter
two characteristics, in particular, can overemphasize encoding artifacts in video.
Plasma display device panel (PDP) Plasma displays work by applying a charge to a small
gas-filled cell. The gas becomes ionized and, in turn, interacts with a phosphor on the surface
of the cell, which glows a given color. Because plasma displays work with phosphors, they are
able to utilize much of the research that has gone into phosphor research for CRTs and
reproduce more natural colors. However, it also means that they may burn in quickly, just like
a CRT, leaving a permanent after-image where something remained on screen for a length of
time. For example, channel logos that occupy a corner of the screen can begin to burn in after
a period of time. Plasma displays can consume large amounts of power compared to other
types of displays, and tend to suffer from bleed-over effects in which the plasma from one
cell bleeds over to other cells.
Liquid-crystal display (LCD) Liquid-crystal displays operate by sandwiching color filters
and polarizing filters on either side of a liquid-crystal cell matrix, and placing a white back-
light behind the sandwich. The backlight remains lit while the display is active. The liquid
crystal in each cell, by default, stays “curled” up such that it blocks the polarized illumination
from the backlight. When a charge is applied to a cell, the crystal “unwinds,” allowing the
illumination from the backlight to escape through the color filter. One of the most noticeable
problems with LCD is the limited viewing angle, although with the latest updates to these
technologies, the viewing angle has been extended dramatically (up to as much as 178
degrees). Increased viewing angle tends to lead to increases in light bleed — white light that
escapes to wash out the picture and raise black levels. In addition, the “unwinding” process
Technology Primer
2

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

takes time at a molecular level. As a result, it takes time to refresh the display. An LCD, with
a refresh time of more than 33 ms will blur 30 fps video. A refresh time of 16.7 ms is needed
to maintain the 59.94 fields per second rate of de-interlaced video. Newer LCDs with very
low pixel latency can handle even 120 Hz display rates (8.3 ms). LCDs do not suffer from
burn in.
Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) Similar to DLP rear projection displays, this type of tele-
vision operates by projecting colored light through a translucent matrix of liquid crystals, in
which each cell can be individually made opaque, transparent or somewhere in between.
Unfortunately, because LCoS uses liquid crystal, these displays tend to suffer from the same
performance issues as LCD and often require three separate light sources (or one light
source with three pathways through three separate color filters) in order to provide full color
reproduction.
With the rapid acceptance of these display technologies and with new ones emerging, such
as, organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), high dynamic range (HDR), D-ILA (Digital Direct
Drive Image Light Amplifier) , and SXRD (Silicon X-tal Reflective Display), the content pro-
ducer’s job becomes a bit more complicated. It used to be that a producer only had to worry
about NTSC and PAL video formats. Now they have a half dozen new display technologies
that bring their own problems to the reproduction mix.
HD Discs Meet HD Video Meet HD Television
As the Blu-ray Disc format enters the marketplace, it joins the collection of already intro-
duced HD video formats. In the broadcasting arena, there is an ongoing battle between the
high-definition video formats — 720p (1280×720 resolution at 59.94 progressive frames per
second) and 1080i (1920×1080 resolution at 29.97 interlaced frames per second). Television
stations, depending on their affiliations, are broadcasting in one or the other HD flavor. Yet,
there is a massive push for technology to catch up with the desire to reproduce imagery in
the 1080/24p format. The problem is that broadcast television is limited in its high-definition
data rate to that of 19 Mbps. The advanced video codecs, VC-1 and AVC, can do a passable
job of squeezing 1080/24p video to under 19 Mbps, but broadcast formats limited to MPEG-
2 cannot manage it at acceptable quality. In fact, broadcasters are going in a totally different
direction and are splitting their available bandwidth to distribute secondary digital channels
that use some of that 19 Mbps. The result is that a television station’s HD broadcast channel
may be going on the air at a rate of 12 to 14 Mbps or even less.
Even more challenging to the consumer is understanding and accepting what their
widescreen display is doing to reproduce both the television station signals and their Blu-ray
Disc player output. For the forseeable future, a Blu-ray Disc in a state-of-the-art Blu-ray
player, playing on a 1920×1080 HD display, will be the best way to view high-definition
video because Blu-ray can use up to 40 Mbps for the video stream. Yet, even that is a result
of an encode/decode process that concludes with a data stream consisting of 8-bit video in a
4:2:0 colorspace.
It is only recently that displays are being produced and marketed as capable of reproduc-
ing the elusive 1080/24p image format, with a native resolution of 1080 lines and progressive

scan. A considerable number of high-definition displays only have a native resolution of
approximately 1280×720. Some are slightly smaller (e.g., 1024×768 for some DLPs) while
others may be higher (e.g., 1368×848 for some plasma displays). However, there is still a sig-
nificant number of displays (rear projection or CRTs) that prefer 1080i.
The good news is that EICTA31 developed HD 1080p logos that help consumers identify
displays with a native resolution of, at least, 1920×1080. The “Ready” logos refer to displays
without built-in HD TV tuners. Note that the HD logos only require 720 lines. The DTV and
HDTV logos from the US Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) are not helpful in this
case, because they do not distinguish 1080p from 720p (Figure 2.29).
Finally, an overriding concern is that a display may state that it supports the 720p or the
1080i or the 1080p video format, but they rarely indicate what scaling, frame rate conversion,
deinterlacing, or other signal processing these formats may undergo prior to being displayed.
Finding a good match between video format and display device may be just a matter of luck
for some time to come. Education and understanding of these constantly evolving technolo-
gies is the only good course, albeit a never-ending one. Ah, well...

Chapter 3
Features
The features available with Blu-ray Disc™technology are considerably more advanced
than the features introduced with standard DVD. This chapter describes the breadth of gen-
eral feature approaches that may be incorporated in a BD title.
Feature playability is also dependent on the capabilities of the player being utilized for dis-
play. The Blu-ray Disc Association established a stepped introduction of players, referred to
as Profiles, that allowed manufacturers to roll out players and feature capabilities in stages.
Please see Chapter 7, Players.
Building on DVD Features
The creators of DVD realized that to succeed, DVD had to be more than just a roomier
CD or a more convenient laserdisc. Hollywood had started the ball rolling by requesting a
digital video consumer standard that would hold a full-length feature film, had better picture
quality than existing high-end consumer video plus widescreen aspect ratio support, con-
tained multiple versions of a program with parental control, supported high-quality sur-
round-formatted audio with soundtracks for at least three languages, and had built-in con-
tent protection. Next, the computer industry added their requirements of a single format for
computers and video entertainment with a common cross-platform file system, high perfor-
mance for both movies and computer data, compatibility with CDs and CD-ROMs, compat-
ible recordable and rewritable versions, no mandatory caddy or cartridge, and high data
capacity with reliability equal to or better than CD-ROM. Hollywood agreed that they too
wanted a content protection system, with the added requirement that the then new disc stan-
dard had to include a locking system to control release across different geographic regions of
the world.
Following those initial development steps, the designers threw in a few more features,
multiple camera angles and graphic overlays for subtitling or karaoke, and DVD was born.
Unlike CD, where the computer data format was cobbled on top of the digital music format,
the digital data storage system of DVD-ROM is the base format for the standard DVD.
DVD-Video is built on top of DVD-ROM, using a specific set of file types and data types.
From a purely storage application point, a DVD-ROM may contain digital data in almost any
conceivable format, as long as a computer or other device can make use of it. Whereas,
DVD-Video requires simple and inexpensive video players and the format capabilities and
features are strictly defined.
DVD-Audio was very late out of the specifications gate and remains the nearly forgotten
red-headed stepchild of the DVD format family. The plan was to create a separate DVD-
Audio format based on input from the music industry. Their requirements included copyright
identification and content protection, compatibility with DVD-ROM and DVD-Video, CD

playback including an optional hybrid DVD/CD format, navigation with random access sim-
ilar to DVD-Video but also usable on players without an attached video display, a slideshow
feature and, of course, superior sound quality. Unfortunately, DVD-Audio is a classic case
of too little, too late. It did not dramatically improve on CD and it required a special DVD-
Audio player because it was developed after DVD-Video was released. DVD-Audio was
either not quite a success or not quite a failure, depending on how you look at it. Only a few
hundred DVD-Audio discs were made. Music on standard DVD-Video discs sold much bet-
ter. The creators of Blu-ray wisely chose to make the Blu-ray audio-only capability an inte-
gral part of the format from the beginning. Profile 3 audio-only players use a subset of the
HDMV format without video and with simplified controls to play audio from many standard
Blu-ray Discs.
Now that DVD has become firmly entrenched in the marketplace it is incumbent on
would-be-successor technologies, such as Blu-ray, to incorporate innovative features and
compelling advances in order to have a hope of success. The Hollywood studios and major
production houses continue to be driving forces in establishing the functions and features of
media technologies that are heavily oriented toward entertainment (see Table 3.1). Their
motives are not solely altruistic, of course, with the overarching condition being content secu-
rity. With the early breaking of DVD's CSS mechanism, the powers that be in content own-
ership demanded that systems be developed to prevent the unauthorized illegal duplication
of data. Towards that end the criteria for new media technologies remains heavily slanted in
favor of security restrictions (see Chapter 4).
The Makeover from DVD to Blu-ray Disc
As most everyone is familiar with DVD and will inevitably compare it to Blu-ray, the fol-
lowing sections present the features that were introduced with DVD-Video and describe how
these features were adapted for Blu-ray. The term player here also applies to software play-
ers on computers, as well as other devices such as video game consoles that have the ability
to play DVD-Video or Blu-ray Discs.

High-Quality Digital Video and Audio
More than 95 percent of Hollywood movies are shorter than 2 hours and 15 minutes, so
135 minutes was chosen as the goal for DVD. Uncompressed, this much video would require
more than 255 gigabytes1 of storage capacity. DVD exclusively uses MPEG-2 compression to
fit digital video onto a disc. The length of a movie that can fit on a standard DVD depends
almost entirely on how many audio tracks are available and how heavily the video is com-
pressed. Other factors do come into play, such as, the frame rate of the source video (24, 25,
or 30 frames per second), the quality of the original images (soft video is easier to compress
than sharp video or video with a lot of film grain, and clean video is easier to compress than
noisy video), and the complexity (slow, simple scenes are easier to compress than scenes with
rapid motion, frequent changes, and intricate detail). In any case, the average Hollywood
movie easily fits on a standard-definition DVD.
Blu-ray adds two more video compression systems, AVC and VC-1. All three provide
video in widescreen, high-definition as well as standard-definition. Blu-ray also provides the
ability to decode and play a second stream of video in a picture in picture (PIP) window. The
PIP window can be scaled to smaller sizes and can be made partly transparent to reveal the
video underneath. Early Profile 1 Blu-ray players did not have the PIP feature.
Widescreen Movies
Television and movies shared the same rectangular shape until the early 1950s when
movies began to get wider. Television stayed unchanged until recently. With the advent of
HDTV, widescreen became the norm, and it is becoming harder to find "narrowscreen" TVs
in the old 4:3 shape. DVD supported widescreen with anamorphic video, which was squeezed
into a 4:3 shape to fit on the disc in standard TV format, then expanded back out by
widescreen displays.
Blu-ray uses 16:9 widescreen high-definition video formats along with older 4:3 standard-
definition video. Blu-ray players generally windowbox the narrow video for widescreen dis-
play. Blu-ray players can letterbox widescreen video when connected to older 4:3 televisions,
and some can squeeze the video anamorphically to be compatible with older widescreen tele-
visions. Aspect ratios are discussed further in Chapter 2.
Multiple Surround Audio Tracks
The DVD-Video format provides for up to eight soundtracks to support multiple lan-
guages or supplemental audio. Each of these tracks may include surround sound with 5.1
channels of discrete audio2. Audio may be encoded using Dolby Digital (AC-3), DTS Digital
Surround, or MPEG-2 audio. The 5.1-channel digital tracks can be downmixed by the player
for compatibility with legacy stereo systems and Dolby Pro Logic audio systems. An option is
also available for better-than-CD-quality PCM audio. Almost all DVD players include digi-
tal audio connections for high-quality output.

1Digital studio masters for standard-definition video generally use 4:2:2 10-bit sampling, which at 270 Mbps
eats up over 32 megabytes every second. High-definition video is even more bit hungry. A 4:4:4 12-bit master
of 1080p24 video devours 213 megabytes per second. (See Table 2.1.)
2Discrete means that each channel is stored and reproduced separately rather than being mixed together (as
in Dolby Surround) or simulated. The “.1” refers to a low-frequency effects (LFE) channel that adds bass
impact to the presentation.

The usefulness of multiple audio tracks was discovered when digital audio was added to
laserdiscs, leaving the analog tracks free. Visionary publishers, such as Criterion, used the
analog tracks to include audio commentary from directors and actors, musical sound tracks
without lyrics, foreign language audio dubs, and other fascinating or obscure audio tidbits.
Most DVD players allow the user to select a preferred language so that the appropriate
menus, language track, and subtitle track are selected automatically, when available. In many
cases, the selection also determines the language used for the player's on-screen display.
For DVD-Audio, quality was significantly improved by doubling the PCM sampling rates
of DVD-Video to 96 kHz, improving support for multichannel PCM audio tracks and audio
downmixing, and using MLP lossless compression to increase disc playing times. A single-
layer DVD-Audio disc can play 74 minutes of super-fidelity multichannel audio or over seven
hours of CD-quality stereo audio.
Blu-ray ups the ante with Dolby Digital Plus and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio, which
provide higher sampling rates and up to 7.1 channels of surround audio. Higher sampling
rates than DVD can be used with uncompressed audio, as well as with lossless audio com-
pression using Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio. A dual-layer Blu-ray disc can hold
over ten hours of highest quality uncompressed stereo (192/24 PCM) or over 200 hours of
5.1-channel Dolby Digital.
Blu-ray adds sound effects that can be incorporated with the main audio, such as, click
sounds for menus or pop sounds when popup information appears during movie playback.
Audio mixers are built into Blu-ray players so that a secondary audio stream can be overlaid
on the main audio. This opens up a large variety of options, such as, adding a director com-
mentary or fan commentary, swapping in different audio soundtracks, providing comedic
"heckling" of scenes in a movie, creating a censor's "bleep" sounds to block certain words in
the dialog, karaoke track mixing, and more.
Subpictures and Subtitles
The primary video on a standard DVD can be supplemented with one of 32 subpicture
tracks for subtitles, captions, and more. Unlike existing closed captioning or teletext systems,
DVD subpictures are graphics that can fill the screen. The graphics can appear anywhere on
the screen and can create text in any alphabet or symbology. Subpictures can be Klingon
characters, karaoke song lyrics, Monday Night Football-style motion diagrams (telestrator
diagrams), pointers and arrows, highlights and overlays, and much more. Subpictures are
limited to a few colors at a time, but the graphics and colors can change with every frame,
which means subpictures may be used for simple animation and special effects. Some DVDs
use subpictures to show silhouettes of the people speaking on a commentary track, in the
style of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 TV show. Being able to see the gestures and finger
pointing of the commentators enhances the audio commentary.
A transparency effect can be used to dim areas of the picture or make picture areas stand
out. This technique can be used to great effect for educational video and documentaries.
Other options include covering parts of a picture for quizzes, drawing circles or arrows, and
even creating overlay graphics to simulate a camcorder, night-vision goggles, or a jet fighter
cockpit.

Blu-ray extends this concept in subtle but important ways. It implements two simultane-
ous graphic overlays with significantly more color and transparency options than DVD (256
colors and transparencies instead of DVD's 4 colors and 16 transparencies). This means that
animated overlays, menus, popups over video, and the like, are smoother, more detailed, and
more vivid. A powerful computer language can be used to display text, graphics, and anima-
tion over the video.
Blu-ray also adds up to 32 text subtitles. DVD was severely limited because subtitle text
had to be pre-rendered as graphic subpictures, a complicated and error-prone process. Once
on the disc they were immutable. Subtitles in Blu-ray can be taken directly from text sources
in almost any language and displayed in various fonts, colors, and positions on the screen.
Players and discs can provide settings for the viewer to choose display preferences for subti-
tle text.
Musical Slideshows
The DVD-Audio format added a slideshow feature for showing pictures while audio plays.
The pictures may appear automatically at preselected points in the program, or the viewer
can choose to browse them at will, independent of the audio. Although the DVD-Video for-
mat also supports programmed slideshows, it does not support browsable pictures that do not
interrupt the audio. This feature is handy for displaying lyrics of songs as they play. Blu-ray
carries on the tradition of browsable slideshows with uninterrupted music.
Karaoke
DVD includes special karaoke audio modes to play music without vocals or to add vocal
backup tracks, along with information for identifying the music and singer, such as, male
vocalist, female soloist, chorus, and so on. Few DVD players support the karaoke features.
DVD's subtitle feature is also essential for karaoke, providing up to 32 different sets of lyrics
in any language, complete with bouncing balls or word-by-word (or ideogram-by-ideogram)
highlighting.
Blu-ray does not need a special karaoke mode or karaoke player features because even the
most basic Blu-ray player has everything needed to control audio mixing and show animated
on-screen lyrics.
Different Camera Angles
One of the most innovative features of DVD is the option to view a scene from different
angles. A movie or television event may be filmed with multiple cameras, which can then be
authored so that the viewer can switch, at will, between up to nine different viewpoints.
In essence, camera angles are multiple simultaneous video streams. As you watch the
DVD, you can select one of the nine video tracks just as you can select one of the eight audio
tracks. The storytelling opportunities are intriguing, and many creative uses have appeared
on DVD. A movie about a love triangle can be watched from the point of view of each main
character. A murder mystery ends with multiple solutions. A nature scene can be played at
different times of the day, different seasons of the year, or different points in time. Music
videos include shots of each performer, enabling viewers to focus on their favorite band

member or to pick up instrumental techniques. Classic sports videos are designed so that
armchair quarterbacks have control over camera angles and instant replay shots. Exercise
videos allow viewers to choose their preferred viewpoints. Instructional videos provide close-
ups, detail shots, and picture insets containing supplemental information.
The options are endless, and the multiangle approach has become a new tool for film-
making and video production. The disadvantage of this feature is that each angle requires
additional footage to be created and stored on the disc. A program with three angles always
available can only be one third as long if it has to fit in the same amount of space as a single-
angle program. Blu-ray multiangle video is essentially the same as DVD, although there is
more room on the disc for multiangle programs.
Multistory Seamless Branching
A major drawback of almost every video format that came before DVD, including
laserdiscs, Video CD, and even computer-based video formats, such as QuickTime, is that
jumping to another part of the video caused a break in play. DVD-Video overcame this draw-
back and achieved completely seamless branching. For example, a DVD may contain addi-
tional "director's cut" scenes for a movie but can jump over them without a break to recreate
the original theatrical version.
The multistory branching feature creates endless possibilities of the mix-and-match vari-
ety. At the start of a movie, the viewer could choose to see the extended director's cut, with
alternate ending number four, and the punk rock club scene rather than the jazz club scene,
and the player would jump around the disc, unobtrusively stitching the selected scenes
together. Of course, this requires significant additional work by the director or producer, and
most mass-market releases skip this option, leaving it to small, independent producers with
more creative energy.
Blu-ray provides the same multi-story branching feature as DVD. Because Blu-ray players
have relatively larger data buffers there are fewer restrictions on seamless branching, and
even the switch between layers can be seamless, whereas on DVD players it caused the video
to freeze for a moment.
Parental Lock
DVD includes parental management features to block playback of an entire disc or to con-
trol which parts of the disc or which versions of a multi-rated movie can be viewed. A player
can be set to a specific parental level using a password protected onscreen menu. If a disc
with a rating above the selected level is put in the player, it will not play. Each program on
the disc can have a different rating.
A DVD may be designed so that it plays a different version of the movie depending on the
parental level that has been set in the player. By taking advantage of the branching feature,
scenes can automatically be skipped over or substituted during playback, usually without a
visible pause or break. For example, a PG-rated scene can be substituted for an R-rated
scene, along with dialog containing less profanity. This requires that the disc be carefully
authored with alternate scenes and branch points that do not cause interruptions or discon-
tinuities in the soundtrack.

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

Sadly, fewer than one percent of DVDs use the multi-rating feature. Most of the ones that
do, ironically, use it to include unrated scenes rather than provide a more family-friendly ver-
sion. Hollywood studios are not convinced that the demand merits the extra work involved,
which may include shooting extra footage, recording extra audio, editing new sequences, cre-
ating seamless branch points, synchronizing the soundtrack across jumps, submitting new
versions for MPAA rating, dealing with players that do not implement parental branching
properly, having video store chains refuse to carry discs with unrated content, and much
more. The few discs that have multirated content do not have standard package labeling or
other ways to be easily identified.
Another option is to use a software player or a specialized DVD player that can read a
playlist or a use a filter telling it where to skip scenes or mute the audio.3 Playlists can be used
to retrofit thousands of DVD movies that have been produced without parental control fea-
tures.
Blu-ray implements parental control in a more simple and flexible way. The player has a
parental level that can be set using a password protected onscreen menu but, otherwise, the
player does not check the disc or control playback. Commands on the disc can check the
parental level of the player and respond accordingly — stop playback, choose different paths
through a movie, substitute a different audio track, play alternative versions, and so forth.
Menus
To provide access to all the content on a disc, the DVD-Video format includes on-screen
menus. Menus are used to select from among multiple programs, choose scenes (chapters)
within a program, choose audio tracks and subtitles, navigate through multilevel or interac-
tive programs, and more. Playback can stop at any point for interaction with the viewer, or
selectable “hot spots” can be visibly or invisibly placed over live video.
For example, a DVD may have a main menu from which you can choose to watch the
movie, view a trailer, watch a "making of" featurette, or peruse production stills. Another
menu may also be available from which you can choose to hear the regular soundtrack, for-
eign language sound track, or director's commentary. Selecting a "bonus features" option
from the main menu may bring up another menu with options such as cast and crew bios,
script pages, storyboards, and outtakes. 
Menus were a new and unfamiliar feature to many people when DVD was introduced.4 A
decade later, when Blu-ray rolled out, DVD menus had become comfortably familiar yet, in
some ways, frustratingly primitive. (See Chapter 10, Interactivity, for more on limitations of
modal menus.) There was an expectation that Blu-ray would take menus out of the stone age,
which it did.
Blu-ray menus can popup over the video at any time, allowing the viewer to make selec-
tions in the middle of a program without interrupting the program flow. Blu-ray also imple-
ments multipage menus so that submenus appear quickly and without interruption in the

ened versions of the movies over and over. It turned out that the hapless novice thought that the intro video
loop in the menu was all there was.

video and audio. Sound effects can be added, which provide useful feedback when on-screen
buttons are selected. Beyond built-in menu support, the Blu-ray programming language can
be used to construct just about any type of interactive user interface that can be imagined,
limited only by the buttons on the remote control.
Interactivity
DVD can be even more interestingly interactive if the creator of the disc takes advantage
of the rudimentary command language that is built into all DVD players. DVD-Video can be
programmed for simple games, quizzes, branching adventures, and so on. DVD brought a
level of personal control to video programs that simply did not exist before. While it is debat-
able just how much control the average couch potato craves, directing the path and form of
a visual experience is certainly an appealing option to some. Diverse adventurous souls in the
creative community embraced the new genre of nonlinear cinema afforded by DVD.
For example, some music video DVDs provided an editing environment where the viewer
could choose music, scenes, and so on, to create their own custom version. Instructional
videos followed lessons with comprehension quizzes. If a wrong answer was selected, a reme-
dial segment could be played to further explain the topic.
Again, Blu-ray upped the ante with new and exciting levels of user interactivity. While con-
tinuing to offer "standard content" similar to DVD with the HDMV (high-definition movie)
mode, Blu-ray added BD-J, a specially tailored version of Java, the powerful computer pro-
gramming language. BD-J puts Blu-ray interactivity into an echelon far beyond DVD.
Features previously seen only on computers, Websites, and game consoles can now be part
of the experience. Sophisticated applications can be created that go well beyond the simple
menus and games that standard navigation offers. For instance, imagine an application that
allows the viewer to choose from a pre-selected set of stillframes from a movie, generate a
coloring book version of that frame, color it with painting tools, and e-mail the new image to
a friend's Blu-ray player or upload it to a computer for printing. Or, a complete arcade-style
video game played with the buttons on the remote control. More in Chapter 10, Interactivity.
Customization
As noted previously, players may be customized with a parental lock. Other options can be
set on a Blu-ray player to customize the viewing experience. Most Blu-ray players can be set
for the preferred audio language, text and subtitle language, menu language (for disc menus
and, sometimes, for the player's own menus), subtitle style, and country code. For example,
if you are studying French, you can set your preferences to watch movies with French dialog
and English subtitles. If these are available on the disc, they will be selected automatically.
Instant Access
Consumer surveys have indicated that one of the most appealing features of DVD and
Blu-ray is that there is never a need to rewind or to fast forward. Convenience and time can
be inestimably important to consumers — just consider our penchant for microwave ovens,
electric pencil sharpeners, electric windows, and escalators. A DVD or a Blu-ray player can
obligingly jump to any part of a disc -program, chapter, or time position — in less than a sec-
ond.

Trick Play
In addition to near-instantaneous search, most DVD and Blu-ray players include features
such as freeze-frame, frame-by-frame advance, slow motion, double-speed play, and high-
speed scan. Most players scan backward at high speed, but due to the nature of video com-
pression, many cannot play at normal speed in reverse or step a frame at a time in reverse.
Access Restrictions
The author of a DVD or Blu-ray disc can choose to restrict user operations such as fast
forward, chapter search, and menu access. Almost every button on the remote control can be
blocked at any point on the disc. This is not always a benefit to the viewer (when locked into
the FBI warning or "coming attractions" at the beginning of a disc), but it is helpful in com-
plicated discs to keep button-happy viewers from going to the wrong place at the wrong time.
Durability
Unlike tape, optical discs are impervious to magnetic fields. A disc left on a speaker or
placed too close to a motor will remain unharmed. Discs are also less sensitive to extremes
of heat and cold. Because they are read by a laser that never touches the surface, the discs
will never wear out — even your favorite one that you play six times a week or the kids'
favorite one that they play six times a day. Discs are susceptible to scratching, but their
sophisticated error-correction technology can recover from minor damage. Blu-ray includes
a special hard coat that helps protect the surface from scratches.
Playback on PCs
DVDs can include more than what is playable on a standard player. Computer software,
such as, screen savers, games, and interactive enhancements can be included on a disc.
Computers, video game consoles, even cable settop boxes can play DVDs, sometimes with
enhanced DVD features. A single disc might contain a movie, a video game based on the
movie, an annotated screenplay with "hot" links to related scenes or storyboards, as well as
the searchable text of the screenplay's novelization complete with illustrations and hyper-
links. The disc might contain links to Internet Websites with fan discussion forums, related
merchandise, and special promotions.
The quantum leap in power and features on Blu-ray players enables them to do almost
everything that formerly could be done only when a DVD was played in a computer. Many
of the features that were pioneered to enhance DVDs when played in computers were later
incorporated into the Blu-ray format. Of course Blu-ray discs can also be played in comput-
ers equipped with Blu-ray drives.
Network Connection
Blu-ray players that implement the Profile 2, BD-Live, feature set can be hooked up to the
Internet, directly or through a wired or wireless home network. Extra content can be deliv-
ered via the network connection, such as, updated information about the cast and crew
including previews of their latest films, additional language subtitles, games, a new director's

commentary, popup notes for music videos, or dubbed audio tracks that were not ready when
the disc was released. Discs can provide for e-commerce transactions, allowing the viewer to
browse a collection of products and perform a purchase online. Network support does not go
so far as to implement general Web browsing capabilities, but it does provide for streaming
video and audio, uploading and downloading files, and communicating with devices, such as,
cell phones, computers, networked printers, and even other Blu-ray players.
The world of DVD was circumscribed — cozy but cramped. Content creators soon
bumped into every wall and learned the limits of the technology. There was room for cre-
ativity, but only within the compartment delineated by the format specifications. Blu-ray
blows the walls away, especially with connected players. Blu-ray players are specialized yet
incredibly powerful media processing systems cleverly disguised as innocuous plastic rectan-
gles that sit next to a TV and connect to the Internet. They do not pretend to be computers
or Internet appliances — failures such as WebTV and other browser-equipped settop boxes
have proven that few people want to surf the Internet from their couch — and that is both
the challenge and the opportunity: how to craft interactive, connected experiences that
appeal to someone putting their feet up on the sofa to watch a movie.
The possibilities for creative use of BD-J programs connected to the Internet and to other
devices are boundless. In addition to straightforward downloading of video, audio, graphics,
text, and interactive programs from content provider servers, online Web pages can change
the way a disc works in players, driven by updates from individual users or entire online com-
munities. Information flows the other way as well, so that user interactions with the discs in
their players can bubble up to Web sites. Enclaves of enthusiastic and inventive content
developers scattered across the world are germinating ideas, from sensible to harebrained —
j Multiplayer games between BD players or even between BD players, comput-
ers, and mobile phones
j Movie blogs to share with other BD player owners or upload to the Internet
j Live trivia games
j Multiplayer games between BD players or even between BD players, comput-

Some of these ideas will plop into the cyberpond and deservedly sink to the bottom with-
out a ripple, but others could generate huge waves of interest and cultivate new genres of
media interaction and social networking. A lot of people thought YouTube, Twitter, MySpace,
and the like, were faddish notions that would quickly fade, but look what has happened.
Persistent Storage and Local Storage
Unlike DVD players, which are required to perform self-administered amnesia when the
disc is taken out, Blu-ray players have persistent storage, memory space set aside for each
disc to store a small amount of information such as game high scores, last viewed position,
and viewer preferences.
Players also have local storage (which technically includes persistent storage) for holding
content downloaded via the network connection or transferred from disc for later playback.
Local storage may be a small, fixed amount built into the player, or it may be expandable to
many megabytes or gigabytes with an internal hard drive, external memory card, or external
hard disk drive.
Authorized Copying and Authorized Recording
As touched on elsewhere in this book, Blu-ray technology emerged in the middle of the
slow transition from physical to virtual delivery of content. Around the time Blu-ray was
introduced, various approaches were being attempted to allow consumers to legally copy

5One brainstorm that has been around since the first days of WebDVD is the notion that you'd say, "Look at
that shirt she's wearing, I want one just like it," and buy it on the spot. It's never been pulled off, and probably
never will be, but, on the other hand, there's huge potential (good or bad, depending on your viewpoint) in
promoting a sequel to viewers who just finished watching the first movie, offering the soundtrack CD or down-
loadable music files from a film or concert, advertising action figures while the credits roll, and so on.
Consider the art of Amazon.com's "We have suggestions for you…" and how it can be applied after viewers

their DVDs to recordable discs, hard disks, portable devices, and the like, and conversely to
legally download and burn commercial content to recordable DVDs using CSS and other
protection systems. Lessons learned from these initiatives made their way into the Advanced
Access Content System (AACS) so that similar features could be available for Blu-ray.
There are essentially two paths through the convergence zone between physical and digi-
tal — yin and yang bridges, if you will. One is from physical to virtual, where a disc or other
physical medium is copied or translated into digital form for transmission to other devices.
This is managed copying or authorized copying. The bridge in the other direction goes from
virtual to physical, where digitally distributed content is put onto physical media, such as, a
disc or a memory card. This is called managed recording, managed burning, or authorized
recording.
Authorized Copying
As digital technology has increased the demand for content to play on more than one
device, some content owners have espoused the concept of "buy once, play anywhere." For
this to work there must be a way to represent a customer's purchased access rights to a par-
ticular set of content. This can be done with an online "digital locker" or with a physical token
such as a disc or printed serial number.6 Based on the representation of ownership, an autho-
rized copy can be made into an approved content protection or digital rights management
(DRM) technology with permission from the content provider, who has full control to set the
price, number of copies, allowed formats, viewing period, and so on.
There are essentially four models for copying content based on physical media. The first
two models are supported by the managed copy feature of AACS, which is sometimes called
mandatory managed copy, since at least one copy of almost every disc must be permitted.
Duplication. An equivalent copy is made from the original disc to a similar
recordable disc. For example, a BD-ROM movie disc is copied to a BD-R disc.
Conversion. A copy is made from the original disc and adapted in one or more
ways to fit the destination — new physical medium, new video or audio encod-
ing, new application format, new picture size (resolution), or new content pro-
tection system. For example, a Blu-ray Disc is converted to Microsoft Windows
Media format (video and audio are transcoded, menus and interactivity are dis-
carded), at a lower resolution for display on portable media players, and stored
on a flash memory card with Windows Media DRM file encryption.
Digital Copy. The original disc contains an alternative version of the content or
a subset of the content in different form, intended to be copied from the disc.
This is also called second session or digital file.  For example, a Blu-ray Disc
includes a low-resolution version of the video encoded in H.264 format and pro-
tected with Apple FairPlay DRM so that it can be copied using iTunes software
and played on a compatible device such as a Mac, iPod, or iPhone.
E-copy. The original disc is used as the token of ownership to authorize the

6It is possible to combine multiple access rights representation mechanisms, such as, by registering a pur-
chased Blu-ray movie in an online system that also allows purchasing of music downloads, streaming videos,
and mobile phone ringtones. The system — or other allied services if it acts as a clearinghouse — can then
grant various access rights to each owned content item.

download of the same content or related content over the Internet. For exam-
ple, a Blu-ray Disc is inserted into a computer drive to unlock the download of
the music soundtrack as MP3 files that can be played on a computer or portable
music player or burned to CD.
Most authorized copy approaches incorporate the following elements —
j A unique identifier (ID) on the disc, either in a) electronic format such as seri-
al number in the BCA or in a file on the disc, which the copy system can read
directly, or b) in printed form on the disc or packaging, which must be entered
by the user into the copy system.
j An authorization server to verify the unique ID (and to store it in a central data-
base so that attempts to use the same ID again can be blocked or handled
appropriately)
j An optional transaction process for the consumer to pay, watch an advertise-
ment, buy something else, join a mailing list, take a survey, or engage in some
other transaction before being allowed to make the copy.
j A license server that issues the license and usage rights associated with the copy.
The license server is usually part of the DRM used to protect the copy.
j The actual process of copying, converting, or downloading the content.
AACS approves various managed copy output technologies (MCOT), including copying to
a recordable Blu-ray disc using AACS, copying to a recordable DVD using protection sys-
tems such as CPRM or VCPS, copying to memory cards using a protection system such as
CPRM or Sony MagicGate, and copying to digital files using a protection system such as
Windows Media DRM.
Authorized Recording
Given the hundreds of millions of Blu-ray players, DVD players, and CD players that play
discs, and the millions of portable devices that play video from memory cards, plus the recog-
nition that it will take another century or so before every media device on the planet is con-
nected to a vast electronic delivery network, there is clearly a need to put electronically deliv-
ered content onto physical media to bridge the gap to the player. BDs and DVDs are the ulti-
mate sneakernet for video.7 And, there's the tangibility factor. At some level, humans will
never get past the ingrained notion that you do not really own something unless you can hold
it in your hands (and show it off to your friends and neighbors).
The fundamental idea of authorized recording is that protected content, usually delivered
in a digital rights management (DRM) system, can be transferred to portable physical media

7Sneakernet refers to the fact that sometimes it is easier, faster, or cheaper to simply copy data to storage
media such as disc or memory card, walk to the destination, and copy it over. In other words, in the OSI
seven-layer model, the physical layer that is usually implemented as Ethernet or WiFi is replaced with feet in
sneakers. For devices not connected to a network, this is typically the only choice. Well, other than RFC
1149, specifying avian carriers, which was actually implemented on April 28, 2001 in Bergen, Norway using
carrier pigeons. In a sense, Netflix operates the biggest sneakernet in the world, shipping approximately 2 mil-
lion DVDs per day. This equates to 510 petabytes per month, which is astonishing considering that the total
estimated Internet traffic in the U.S. in 2007 was 750 to 1250 petabytes per month (ignoring business traffic it
was around 500 to 825). Sources: Netflix, University of Minnesota Internet Traffic Studies (MINTS).

and bound to the media with an encryption method that is tied to that particular piece of
media. A related concept is a secure move, where the content is transferred between devices
or media in a way that makes the original unplayable, at least while the copy exists.
There are basically two types of authorized secure recording —
Transmitted. Content marked as copyable with restrictions is broadcast to multi-
ple users over the air, via cable, over the Internet, or so on, or is moved or
copied from another device or medium. In other words, the content is not free
to copy, but certain types of copying are pre-authorized. Usually this means a
copy once flag is attached to the content. In most cases, generational copies —
copies of the first copy — are not allowed. Therefore, the pre-authorization stip-
ulates that the recording can only be made into a content protection system that
does not allow additional copies to be made.
Transacted. Content is delivered to a single user based on a purchase or other
transaction that gives the user the right to make one or more copies. Transacted
recording is often used for content that may not sell enough discs to make it
worth the expense of manufacturing, distribution, warehousing, and returns.
Instead, the content is sold online or in retail —taking negligible shelf space —
and is recorded on demand at relatively low cost. This enables physical formats
such as Blu-ray and DVD to move much farther into The Long Tail.8 Other
portable media such as memory cards can be used, but their relatively high price
compared to optical media makes them impractical for permanent collections,
so we'll focus on discs. Transacted copying falls into two broad categories —
Manufacturing On Demand (MOD). MOD is used in two environ-
ments. In factory MOD, merchants use centralized fulfillment centers
where content is stored in digital form and recorded to disc after a
customer places an order, which is then shipped. This is a form of
zero-inventory manufacturing that can be more cost effective than
traditional inventory distribution. The second environment is retail
MOD, also called retail managed recording (RMR). Retail stores or
other locations such as airports, train stations, coffee shops, fast food
outlets, truck stops, and even city streets, can be outfitted with stand-
alone kiosks or with touch-screen panels connected to behind-the-
counter media recording stations. Customers browse through hun-
dreds to tens of thousands of titles (more than could ever fit on a
retail shelf), choose the one they want, and have it recorded, labeled,
and packaged in minutes while they shop or wait for their prescrip-
tion, their plane, or their train.

8Chris Anderson, editor of Wired Magazine, injected the concept of The Long Tail into mainstream conscious-
ness in an October, 2004 article. He argued that technology can bring about low enough cost and wide
enough availability to a large enough market that it becomes profitable to sell hard-to-find items. That is,
providers with low-volume sales of a lot of content may do as well as providers who have a few top-selling
hits.

Electronic sell-through (EST).9 Also called consumer download and
burn (CDB) or network download. Customers use a computer or con-
sumer electronics device, or even a mobile phone, to browse titles
available from an online content service provider (CSP). Their pur-
chases are downloaded to their home system and burned to disc with-
out them ever needing to leave the house.
A key difference between transmitted recording (or secure recording) and transacted
recording (or managed recording) is that with secure recording the copy is pre-authorized.
That is, for content that is appropriately marked, the user is able to record it with an
approved technology, such as AACS, often without being aware that a content protection sys-
tem is engaged. In contrast, managed recording requires authorization from the content
owner or content service provider, usually associated with a transaction by the user. Often an
Internet connection to an authorization server is required, and in the case of AACS, the
unique media identifier of the target recordable disc must be sent to the authorization serv-
er to cryptographically bind the content to the disc.
All of the above are accomplished on Blu-ray Discs through provisions of AACS. AACS
Recordable Video is for recording protected video from transmission sources. AACS Network
Download mode is used for managed recording of AACS Prepared Video for MOD and EST.
AACS Prepared Video is also used for managed copying from a pre-recorded Blu-ray Disc
to a recordable Blu-ray Disc. Prepared Video content has the necessary certificates and hash
tables to be encrypted using AACS.
When this book was finished in fall 2008, the AACS managed copy and managed record-
ing features for Blu-ray were finally, after delays that had stretched over more than two years,
ready to be put in place and launched in the second half of 2009. See Chapter 4 for more
details regarding AACS.

9In general terms, EST refers to any method of selling a permanent electronic copy, as opposed to a transient
electronic copy that is streamed or has a limited viewing period or limited number of views. EST includes
downloads of electronic files for playback on PCs and mobile devices. Therefore, the term EST should be
carefully placed in context when referring only to copies that are recorded to portable media.

Content Protection,
Licensing, and Patents
For the Hollywood studios to support Blu-ray Disc™, they had to be assured that high-def-
inition content would be protected and that it would not be possible to make a digital copy
of the content. To achieve that goal, a number of protection schemes have been adopted by
Blu-ray. These schemes can be segregated into four major categories — conditional access,
protected distribution, protected transmission, and protected storage (see Figure 4.1).
4 - 1

Figure 4.1  Copy Protection

Conditional access.  This method primarily applies to broadcast, cable, or Internet deliv-
ery, where unprotected distribution channels are used. Conditional access ensures that only
the users who are allowed to receive or view the content, actually do.
Protected distribution.  To maintain content security during the delivery to the enduser,
the distribution method must be protected. For Blu-ray, a newly developed protection
scheme called AACS (Advanced Access Content System) provides this security.
Protected transmission.  Once the originally protected content has been decoded, most
likely into baseband form, it is transmitted to either a video display or an audio receiver. In
order to continue protection of the content from unauthorized copies, the transmission
needs to be protected, as well. Even though there are a number of protection mechanisms
for digital transmissions, a so-called “analog hole” exists for analog transmissions of high-def-
inition video. In fact, during the rush to get the first high-definition televisions (HDTVs) into
the market, they were released with unprotected HD analog inputs. Obviously, this would
allow any recording device to easily make a high quality copy of the content.
Protected storage.  To complete a full content protection ecosystem, it is important to pro-
vide means to properly protect copies when they are authorized. Broadcast content may carry
“copy once” constraints that only allow it to be copied using an approved content protection
system. Fair use doctrine historically suggests allowing one copy of a work for backup pur-
poses. AACS follows these guidelines, and furthermore provides an entirely new protection
system called Managed Copy. This system allows the consumer to create additional copies of
a disc’s content, but the content owner manages whether the copy is either free of charge or
only possible for an additional fee.
Implementing Content Protection
Even though the pursuit of total content protection is an exciting exercise, realistically, it
is in vain because it likely would make the disc impossible to play and would ultimately result
in an unsatisfying user experience. However, many engineering hours have been and will be
spent on improving content protection systems, to not only prevent digital copies but also to
ensure degradation of the quality of analog copies. Otherwise, an analog copy would only be
slightly degraded from the original digital source, and could very well be used as the source
for creating multiple additional digital copies. Some of the AACS measures to prevent dupli-
cation are discussed later in this chapter.
An additional security measure is watermarking. Watermarking can either be used for pre-
venting playback of unauthorized copies, which requires the playback devices to recognize
watermarked content, or it can help to trace back to the origin of an unauthorized copy, thus
allowing for appropriate action to be taken against the perpetrator.
In order for a content protection system to be effective, it requires three areas to work
hand in hand — technology, business, and legislation. The technology piece clearly defines
the specific protection method of encryption or watermarking to prevent digital or analog
copies. The business aspect is usually addressed by license agreements requiring manufac-
turers to only release compliant devices and for content owners to produce reasonably priced

content. And, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the entire system, legal enforcement is
necessary.
Content owners, manufacturers, and consumers have different expectations as to what
they want out of a content protection system, and all their needs must be balanced to make
content protection a success.
The requirements of content owners are —
j Maintain the highest quality possible of the content 
j Protection against unauthorized use 
j Robustness and tamper-resistance 
j Renewable system (recovery after breach) 
j Applicable to all forms of distribution or media 
j Suitable for implementation on CE devices and PCs 
j Low cost 
The requirements of system manufacturers are —
j No effect on normal use of a system
j Low resource requirements
j Voluntary implementation
j Low cost 
The requirements of consumers are —
j No effect on normal use of a system
j Maintain the highest quality possible of the content 
j Fair-use copying 
j No additional cost
j No limitations on playback equipment or environment 
j No artificial barriers (inconvenience) to access the content
As some of the requirements may conflict at times, the resulting content protection system
ends up being a compromise. However, in the case of the content protection systems for Blu-
ray, each group seems fairly happy with the outcome. As a result, manufacturers are busy
building players, studios are creatively producing content, and consumers are buying players
and discs.
Although the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) defines which content protection systems
are mandatory and which are optional for Blu-ray Discs, the technical specifications of these
technologies are not defined by the BDA. Instead, separate groups under separate licenses
establish them. However, the BDA, through its Content Protection Group (CPG), provides
a framework for coordination with the industry groups. The CPG reviews the various content
protection technologies and submits them to the BDA for approval. Once approved, the var-
ious groups within the BDA may amend the necessary specifications to incorporate support
for the required content protection technologies.
There are a multitude of content protection systems in place covering encryption, water-
marking, playback control, protection of analog and digital outputs, et cetera. Figure 4.2 pro-

vides an overview of the content protection ecosystem, describing the various pieces. The
applicable technologies for Blu-ray are described in detail in the following sections of this
chapter.
Advanced Access Content System (AACS)
The mandatory and, thus, primary copy protection system for Blu-ray is called AACS,
Advanced Access Content System. As optical discs have been around for quite some time, it
is only natural that AACS is based on its predecessors with improvements from lessons
learned in the past. The copy protection system used for DVD is called Content Scrambling
System (CSS). The CSS technology uses Title Keys that are stored in sector headers of a disc
and Disc Keys that are stored in the control area of a disc. Even though both disc areas were
considered to be very secure, as they cannot be directly accessed from a DVD-ROM drive,
it took less than two years after format launch for CSS to be hacked. A security flaw in a soft-
ware player exposed some of the keys, which was enough to reverse engineer the entire CSS
system and disable the protection mechanism on all players.
The successor format to CSS is called Content Protection for Prerecorded Media (CPPM)
and includes a number of improvements over CSS that added robustness and reliability. For
instance, CPPM does not use Title and Disc Keys anymore, replacing them with identifiers
that are stored in the disc lead-in area. This area does not exist on recordable media, mak-
ing it impossible to create a duplicate copy of the disc, even if it could be decoded. This
method was first used for protecting DVD-Audio discs.
Yet, Hollywood was trying to find a content protection system strong enough for their
valuable high-definition content. Eight companies joined forces — IBM, Intel, Microsoft,
Matsushita, Sony, Toshiba, Walt Disney, and Warner Bros. —  to develop the AACS protec-
tion scheme. The resulting system promises a seamless, advanced, robust, and renewable
content protection system. But it does not stop with the protection of optical discs. New busi-
ness models, such as electronic distribution to home media servers or portable devices were
also considered during the development process. In this way, the same content security could

be applied to multiple destinations providing a futureproof and manageable system for con-
tent owners.
Technical Overview
The underlying encryption technology used for AACS is the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) with 128-bit keys. For key management, the Media Key Block (MKB) tech-
nology is used, which was first introduced for CPPM and proved to be very robust. The
AACS licensing entity provides a set of Device Keys for each compliant device and a Media
Key Block to a replicator for inclusion on each disc. Using the MKB on a disc in combina-
tion with a specific set of Device Keys, each compliant device is able to calculate a Media Key.
This Media Key is then used to decrypt the Title Key, which then is used to decrypt the
audio/video content on the disc. This encryption chain adds additional layers of security.
An additional security measure for AACS is revocation. The MKB on each disc includes a
Host Revocation List (HRL) for software player applications and a Drive Revocation List
(CRL) for ROM drives. The most up-to-date version of each revocation list is permanently
stored in non-volatile memory of a device.  In this way, disc playback in a computer will only
be successful if neither of the two components is on a revocation list and if both components
can verify each other as compliant, uncompromised devices. This revocation mechanism
allows for future discs to contain updated Media Key Blocks with new revocation lists that
disable the disc playback on compromised devices.
There is one drawback to device revocation, however. In order to revoke a device, the cor-
responding Device Key needs to be known. As Device Keys could be shared across a manu-
facturer’s entire line of player models, it is a very difficult task to identify which individual
device was compromised. A starting point to address this issue is the Sequence Keys process
(Figure 4.3).
Content Protection, Licensing, and Patents

Blu-ray Disc Demystified
Figure 4.3  Sequence Key Example

The approach is to divide a movie into multiple sections — up to six Sequence Key Blocks
(SKB). Each SKB can contain up to 256 PlayLists, with each PlayList containing a set of
PlayItems for Sequence Key segments and non-Sequence Key segments. Each segment con-
tains multiple versions of the same scene, but with differing forensic marks embedded. Each
individual player calculates a particular path through the movie, thereby allowing investiga-
tors to narrow down which particular player was used to pirate the movie. However, as the
number of segments is limited, an individual player cannot be singled out by using only one
disc. Instead, it will take a few discs to identify an individual player.
To address the threats from computer playback environments, yet another security mea-
sure was introduced by AACS — a proactive software renewal process. The ultimate aim of
this method is to prevent hacks similar to the breaking of CSS. This proactive software
renewal approach mandates that software players have to authenticate themselves on a reg-
ular basis to ensure that they are not compromised. If the authentication fails, the player is
disabled. Further, an enhanced drive authentication has been introduced that enables new
usage scenarios, such as, content distribution to home media servers or network connectivi-
ty for e-commerce applications.
Authentication and Decryption
The AACS decryption process is essentially a method for the management and distribu-
tion of cryptographic keys. In fact, there is not just one key but there are multiple keys nec-
essary to encrypt AACS protected content.
Basically, the decryption process of the playback device starts by processing the most
recent Media Key Block (MKB), either off the disc or from within the drive. Calculating this
MKB with the Device Keys stored inside the player generates the Media Key. The Media
Key is then cryptographically calculated with the Volume ID from the disc to create a Key
Variant Unit. In combination with the Unit Key Files stored on the disc, this Key Variant Unit
is used to decrypt the Title Key. And, finally, the Title Key is used to decrypt the content from
the disc.  These rather complicated processes are in place to properly secure the Title Key,
since it is the only information needed to decrypt the content. By implementing such encryp-
tion chains, a level of added security can be achieved.
For communication between a computer drive and a software player application, there is
an additional authentication process needed to verify the integrity of both components. The
process is divided into two stages. Authentication between the host computer (a software
player) and the drive unit ensures that neither component is listed on the respective
Revocation List and both can be authenticated as being compliant with the specification. The
result of this authentication process is a shared Bus Key. This Bus Key is used for the second
stage of the process — Bus encryption. Because only these components have the Bus key, the
data being sent between the components cannot be compromised, and any other unautho-
rized component is not able to make sense of the data. Finally, the drive calculates a Read
Data Key that is encrypted by the Bus Key and sent over to the host for decryption. Once
decrypted, the host is ready to receive actual data from the disc. Now, whenever the drive is
reading data off the disc, is encrypted using this Read Data Key, because only that specific
software player understands how to decrypt the data. Figure 4.4 outlines the AACS
Authentication Process, including the Bus encryption.

Figure 4.4  AACS Authentication Process

AACS Managed Copy
In addition to conventional disc-based security measures, new business models for elec-
tronic distribution were also considered during the AACS development process. A procedure
termed AACS Managed Copy can authorize a consumer to move content from the disc to a
home media server or a portable device. This also bridges the gap to new business models
such as electronic distribution of content. The Blu-ray Disc not only contains the high-defi-
nition version of a movie but may also contain information pertinent to making an autho-
rized copy of the disc. The Blu-ray Disc may also provide links to additional or related con-
tent that is available for download. The content owner fully controls, on a title-by-title basis,
what is being offered and under what conditions. And, since the Internet drives all of this,
the offers and rules can change at any time, keeping the system highly flexible.
Technically, an AACS protected disc provides a link to a specific Managed Copy Server
(MCS), which authenticates a specific disc predicated on an embedded Prerecorded Media
Serial Number (PMSN). This PMSN is a unique identifier stored in the Burst Cutting Area
(BCA) for each individual disc. Each player contains a Managed Copy Machine (MCM) that
is used to establish secure communication and transaction with the Managed Copy Server.
Once the MCS has presented the offers that are available for a given title, it is up to the
customer to select an option — copy, or download, or other — and the transaction and
authentication process between the MCM and MCS can then take place. As soon as the
transaction is finished, either for a fee or free of charge based on the rules defined by the
content owner, the copy process begins.
BD-ROM Mark
In addition to AACS, there is a second mandatory content protection system for replicat-
ed Blu-ray Discs that uses a physical perturbation of the disc called the BD-ROM Mark. The
concept of physical marks has been around since the days of Super Audio CDs and it proved
very effective back then. The Blu-ray Disc Association picked up on the concept of a physi-
cal mark and instituted its use in combination with AACS. The physical mark contains infor-
mation that is required for AACS processing. In detail, a BD-ROM Mark contains a 128-bit
key as payload on the disc as the Volume ID. As previously noted, a Volume ID is essential
in the decryption process of a disc. Without this information, the content on the disc cannot
be decrypted successfully. The BD-ROM Mark does not prevent a copy from being made,
but it blocks playback of the copy if it is recorded onto another disc.
In addition to the added security provided by the BD-ROM Mark, the physical mark can
also be used for tracking purposes in the event that pirated discs are discovered. This track-
ing function is made possible by the BD-ROM manufacturing process. When the Volume ID
is calculated, the manufactured disc is irrevocably tied to the mastering facility. Hence, the
place where the counterfeit discs were replicated can be identified in this way.
All prerecorded Blu-ray Discs (other than BD-5 and BD-9) must contain this mark, oth-

makes it impossible to create bit-to-bit copies of a disc. And, tampering with the mark is very
difficult as well given that only licensed BD players are able to read the BD-ROM Mark, and
the mark is never transmitted outside the player. This process creates a very closed environ-
ment, thereby making this a formidable solution in the fight against piracy, even on a pro-
fessional level.
For disc replication, a special piece of hardware called the BD-ROM Mark Inserter is
required to encode and insert the Volume ID key, and to format the BD-ROM Mark prop-
erly. The Inserter is only available to licensed BD-ROM manufacturers under strict security
obligations to ensure integrity of the process. Further, both the mastering facilities and the
player manufacturers have to be licensed, thereby providing a substantial security threshold
for protecting disc content, in addition to AACS.
BD+
The technology that is now called BD+ was initially developed by Cryptography Research,
Inc. under the name Self-Protecting Digital Content (SPDC). Subsequently, it was acquired by
Macrovision and is licensed by BD+ Technologies, LLC. The technology does exactly what
is implied by the original name — it protects digital content on a disc and provides for coun-
termeasures that actively react to attacks and to fix security holes, hence the digital content
protects itself against attacks. The implementation is based on a dedicated Security Virtual
Machine (SVM) inside each player. This SVM can be compared to the Java VM used for BD-
J, but the SVM is much smaller. BD+ is mandatory for Blu-ray players and PC player soft-
ware, but is optional for Blu-ray Discs. The only purpose of the SVM is to load security code
(also called content code) from the Blu-ray Disc and run this code while the disc is playing.
Essentially, the content code may perform all sorts of operations in a very secure environ-
ment. The main goal of BD+ is to detect security problems inside the player and react to cor-
rect the problem. Since the content code can also interact with the HDMV and BD-J layer
of the disc, for example, by passing parameters back and forth, the behavior of the disc can
be altered when a security problem is detected (e.g., show a warning screen). BD+ also pro-
vides additional features, such as, countermeasures, Media Transform, and Forensic
Marking.
If security problems are found inside a player, countermeasures are intended to reverse
them. This task requires intimate knowledge of the player software, so these countermea-
sures are typically developed by the player manufacturer in order to fix the security leaks
identified. Countermeasures allow problems to be fixed on an individual basis, player by
player, rather than impacting an entire series of players.
Media Transform allows the content code to execute transformations to the media on the
disc (e.g., the video). The concept is to store heavily distorted video on the disc, which would
not be viewable in its native form following AACS decryption. The BD+ content code takes
charge of correcting the video by applying a Fix Up Table (FUT) during playback. In this way,
a player cannot be easily hacked to circumvent the content code, as the video material would
not be viewable. As the video is being manipulated during playback, this provides an excel-

lent opportunity for an additional security feature — Forensic Marking. It is even possible to
individualize the forensic mark by inserting the player serial number into the payload. This
allows identifying the specific player that was used for piracy, and allows for a countermea-
sure to be written for that specific player in order to fix the security problem.
Although Figure 4.5 outlines how the three major content protection systems for Blu-ray
Disc — AACS, BD-ROM Mark, and BD+ — work together, there are a lot of additional
possibilities for BD+, at its core, it provides a secure environment to run code and perform
myriad operations.
Content Protection on Recordable Discs
Because a large emphasis was put on the consideration of new business models during the
development process of the AACS specification, it does not come as a surprise that content
on recordable discs and other electronic distribution channels can also be protected using
AACS. The method to be used for such things is called AACS Protection for Prepared Video.
The technology is very similar to that used for prerecorded media (i.e. ROM discs), but on
recordable discs it allows content protection for other business models, such as —
j Electronic Sell-through (EST)
EST, also known as download and burn, describes the content typi-
cally distributed through the Internet that can be stored on a com-
puter, or burnt onto a recordable disc.
j Manufacturing on Demand (MOD)
This service provides a distribution channel that is particularly suited
for niche content that may create discs on-demand. Typical scenarios

include individual disc replication as needed (once an individual
order is received), or a kiosk model, where discs are created in stores
based on a customer’s order. This allows for a large amount of con-
tent (especially deep library content) to be prepared and stored on
large servers, so that discs can be created when an order is received.
j Managed Copy to Optical Discs
AACS allows endusers to make an authorized copy of a disc under
the control of the content provider — Managed Copy. To make a
copy to another optical disc, AACS provides the means to properly
secure the copy.
Generally, prepared video follows the same criteria as AACS on prerecorded media, but
it does enable different business models and distribution channels by gaining independence
from physical storage formats. For example, it provides a robust protection for content deliv-
ered through EST or Managed Copy. It also enables the content owners to fully control the
EST channels and allows for validating prepared video discs that were created with content
owner approval.
From a technical perspective, there are a number of steps involved in creating a record-
able disc with AACS security. To begin with, there are at least four different entities involved
in the process —
A License Preparer
Entity preparing the content and issuing the license
B Prepared Video Authorization Server (PVAS)
Entity that hosts the key pairs, and licenses. The PVAS also gener-
ates the security tokens to be included on the recordable disc. The
PVAS can host the content itself, or hosting can also be provided by
another entity.
C Recorder
Provides information about the recordable media and ultimately
records the data onto the disc
D AACS LA
As with any AACS process, the AACS Licensing Agency must sign
the content certificate for each prepared video.
Although there are a number of entities involved, the technical workflow is rather simple.
It starts with the License Preparer and the preparation of the content by applying the AACS
technology. The License Preparer also has a Public Key of the PVAS and uses this key to gen-
erate a content certificate for the specific piece of prepared video content. AACS LA will
have to sign this content certificate, which will subsequently be returned to the PVAS. From
this point on, the content is available for distribution. If a copy of that content is made on a
recordable disc, the content needs to be bound to the media. Every individual disc has a
unique Media ID that the recorder sends to the PVAS along with a Binding Nonce, which is
used to create the Prepared Video Token (PVT). The PVAS generates a PVT based on the
Content Protection, Licensing, and Patents
4
4 - 1 1
Blu-ray Disc Demystified

Content Certificate, the Media ID, and the Binding Nonce. This marries the content to an
individual disc. Once that is complete, the prepared video (the content), the Content
Certificate for the content, and the associated PVT are sent to the recorder.  As every
licensed Blu-ray player is required to validate the Content Certificate and the PVT prior to
playback of the disc, this process assures the integrity of each individual AACS protected
recordable disc.
The decryption process for recordable discs is akin to that for prerecorded discs. Yet, there
are a few differences. Because recordable discs do not have a BD-ROM Mark, the Volume
ID cannot be stored on the disc in the typical fashion. However, as the Prepared Video Token
is calculated based on the Volume ID and the Content Certificate ID, the playback device
can easily extract the requisite information from the PVT for the decryption process.
Watermarking
Watermarking is a process that embeds information within the content yet remains trans-
parent to the enduser, thus making it difficult to be removed or to be easily changed. If a
watermark is present, certain digital video frames and/or segments of audio are permanent-
ly marked with noise that is supposed to be undetectable by human eyes or ears. In practice,
there is considerable debate about how undetectable watermarks really are. To reduce the
impact of watermarks on the user experience, watermark intensity can be adjusted based on
the content itself. As an example, for a very dynamic piece of content, the amount of water-
marking could be reduced to decrease the possible impact, whereas for a more static scene,
the amount could be increased. The watermark is essentially a digital signature that can be
recognized by recording and playback equipment. Regardless of the digital or analog trans-
formation of the content, the watermark signature remains embedded. Watermarking is not
really protecting the content, but it identifies the status of the content.
Using watermarking in conjunction with a content protection system usually carries
Content Management Information (CMI) data. Whenever the content is played back, a com-
pliant device recognizes the CMI carried in the watermark and abides by its constraints.
Obviously, this only works if the device implements the watermark detection. To encourage
device manufacturers to do so, a requirement is included and defined in other encryption
technology license agreements. If a manufacturer wants to get the keys and the secrets to
play encrypted content, they must sign a license agreement which mandates the implemen-
tation of the watermark detection. AACS exemplifies such a scenario in which a manufac-
turer has to implement a specific watermarking technology in order to get access to the keys
necessary for encryption. In this case, all Blu-ray Disc players must implement the circuitry
to recognize the watermarking technology developed by Verance (and originally used by
DVD-Audio).
Another way to use watermarks is for forensic purposes. Forensic marking is used to trace
the path of legitimate content. If unauthorized copies of the content are created, the foren-
sic mark will help identify the source of the piracy. As an example, the forensic mark could
help identify which source tape was used to create the pirated copy. In the case of Blu-ray,

Thomson’s NexGuard technology is closely integrated with the BD+ protection system to
provide a more active solution. NexGuard embeds invisible information into the video out-
put. Then, if content were to be pirated, it could be traced back to the player used, which
would allow future titles to contain updated BD+ security code to fix the security hole.
Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP)
To preserve the high quality of digital video, it is imperative that the digital signal be trans-
mitted all the way to the receiving end — the digital television or digital video recorder. But,
due to content protection concerns, this has not always been the case (i.e., as with some DVD
players). Instead, the player converted the pristine digital signal to an analog signal and the
receiver would convert back to digital, resulting in a loss of quality.
Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) provides a solution for the security con-
cerns when content is being sent via digital connections. Developed by Intel, Sony, Hitachi,
Matsushita, and Toshiba (also referred to as 5C), DTCP primarily focuses on IEEE 1394 (aka
FireWire™) and Internet protocol (IP) connected devices, but it can also be applied to other
transmission protocols. The technology defines an authentication protocol for digitally con-
nected devices, such as DVD players, digital TVs, and digital recorders. With DTCP, con-
nected devices establish a secure transmission channel by exchanging keys and authentica-
tion certificates. Once established, the player sends an encrypted audio/video signal to the
receiving device, which decrypts the signal. Other connected devices, if present, that are not
authorized to receive the signal cannot hijack it because they do not have the decryption
keys. If the content on a disc is not protected, it doesn’t need to be encrypted during trans-
mission.
An additional bonus is the “renewability” of the security. New content (new discs or new
broadcasts) and new devices can carry updated key blocks and revocation lists identifying
compromised devices. There is a difference between the privileges of playback-only devices
and recorders. If a device is only able to reproduce audio and video, it is allowed to receive
data through the DTCP connection, as long as it can authenticate itself for being a playback-
only device. However, digital recording devices can only receive data that either is unpro-
tected or is marked as copyable. In the latter case, if the source is marked as “copy once”,
the recorder must change this flag to “do not copy” or “no more copies”. Since DTCP only
impacts the digital connection between playback and receiving devices, there are no changes
needed for the content itself.
High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP)
During the search for a digital replacement of the analog VGA connection standard, the
Digital Display Working Group (DDWG) was formed in 1998. The mission was to create a
universal digital interface standard between computers and displays. The founding members
of DDWG included Silicon Image, Intel, Compaq, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and NEC.
Progress was made rather quickly with the release of the Digital Visual Interface (DVI) spec-
ification in April 1999.
Content Protection, Licensing, and Patents

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

The DVI specification is based on the panelLink technology originally developed by
Silicon Image. DVI quickly gained wide acceptance in the industry due to its low-cost, high-
speed digital connection for video displays. DVI supports all HDTV resolutions, in fact, it
supports up to 1600×1200 (UXGA) resolution and even higher resolutions are possible with
dual links. DVI exceeds by far the bitrate limitation of contemporary IEEE 1394 implemen-
tations. IEEE 1394 supports bitrates up to 40 Mbps, which would be enough for most com-
pressed MPEG videos, whereas DVI supports up to 4.95 Gbps, which is more than enough
for high-definition video of all sorts.
Alas, in its initial configuration, DVI was missing a security component. But Intel quickly
proposed a solution — High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP). HDCP can be
used with multiple digital video monitor interfaces, such as DVI, HDMI (High Definition
Multimedia Interface), and DisplayPort. See Chapter 7 for more information on HDMI.
HDCP contains three components — authentication with key exchange, encryption, and
revocation. HDCP ciphers and circuitry are implemented both in transmitters and in
receivers, to ensure a secure end-to-end connection. Each transmitter (e.g., a player or a
computer) and each receiver (e.g., a display or a recorder) has programmable read-only
memory (PROM) circuitry that is used to store secret device-specific keys provided by the
HDCP licensing entity. The authentication between devices is a cryptographic process veri-
fying that the receiving device is indeed authorized to receive.
It is not mandatory that manufacturers include HDCP circuitry in their devices. Further,
because HDCP was introduced after the first DVI-compliant monitors were released, there
is a possibility that a device with HDCP could detect that it is connected to a non-HDCP-
capable display. When this situation occurs, the transmitting device will lower the image
quality of the protected content before transmission.
Each HDCP-compliant device has an array of 40 keys that are 56 bits each and a corre-
sponding 40-bit binary Key-selection Vector (KSV), provided by the HDCP licensing authori-
ty. The transmitter sends the KSV with a random 64-bit value that initiates the authentica-
tion process. The receiver returns its own KSV, which is then checked by the transmitter to
ensure that the key has not been revoked. Both devices individually calculate a shared value
from the exchanged data that will be equal if both devices have valid keys. Because both ends
of the transmission share the same value, it can be used to encrypt the protected data in the
transmitter and to decrypt the data in the receiver. To ensure that the connection is still
secure, a reauthentication occurs every few seconds. This avoids scenarios in which an autho-
rized device is unplugged and an unauthorized device is connected instead. An unauthorized
device will not be able to decrypt the stream and the content will appear as random noise.
Summary of Protection Schemes
Contrary to DVD, where all content protection systems were optional for the producer of
the disc, there are mandatory content protection implementations for Blu-ray — AACS and
BD-ROM Mark. Obviously, since BD-ROM Mark contains hidden keys that are necessary
for AACS decryption, if one is mandatory both have to be. Once the AACS licensing agree-

ments become finalized it may become mandatory to embed a Verance audio watermark on
the disc, as well.
The other protection schemes described above are optional for the disc producer. It is a
choice for the producer whether or not BD+ protection is added to a disc, with or without
forensic marks. As for the transmission protection systems, DTCP and HDCP, the player or
computer handles them, not the disc developer.
The Analog Sunset
There are no reliable protection mechanisms for analog transmissions of high-definition
video content — the so-called “analog hole”. This presents a serious problem since there are
many HD-ready displays in the marketplace that do not have digital connection technology.
These HD-ready devices can only display HD content delivered via analog inputs, which may
allow for easier copying of high-definition content. Obviously, this is not a satisfying scenario
for the Hollywood industry that is trying to protect their high quality content.
As much as Hollywood would like to dismiss the fact that there are a number of analog
HD displays in the market and to simply not release unprotected content into the analog
realm, a compromise had to be found in order to avoid dissatified customers. As a result, an
agreement was instituted that will result in the so-called “analog sunset”, or termination of
non-digital high-definition connectivity. This analog sunset takes place in two stages. The
first stage begins with all products manufactured and sold after December 31, 2010. They will
be allowed to only transmit high-definition content through encrypted digital outputs.
Content that may be passed through analog connections can only be in standard-definition
interlace mode, such as, composite, s-video, or 480i component. The second stage of this ana-
log sunset requires that products manufactured and sold after December 31, 2013 are not
allowed to pass any content through analog outputs.
In the meantime, the AACS specifications provide mechanisms to control the behavior of
the protected content. There are two flags that can be applied to disc behavior — the Image
Constraint Token (ICT) and the Digital Only Token (DOT). The ICT restricts the resolution
of the content to be passed through analog outputs to not exceed 520,000 pixels per frame.
This translates to a resolution of 960×540 pixels for a 16:9 aspect ratio. There are no further
restrictions on post-processing algorithms, such as scaling, line doubling, or other video pro-
cessing techniques that can be applied within the display. AACS also defines which devices
are allowed to pass content through their analog outputs prior to the first sunset date of
December 31, 2010, as outlined in Table 4.1.
The other flag, the Digital Only Token, prevents the transmission of decrypted AACS con-
tent through analog outputs. When the DOT flag is set, only protected digital outputs are
allowed to transmit the content. Furthermore, digital interfaces are required to be protected
by DTCP, HDCP, or by the Windows Media Digital Rights Management (WMDRM) process
from Microsoft™. DOT was not implemented in the AACS interim agreement.

Ramifications of Content Protection
Ever since digital content was released in a high quality, such as that for DVD, the studios
have become more and more wary of the risks surrounding the protection of digital content.
It did not take long to blame the creation of casual copies for billions of dollars in lost rev-
enues. As a result, most of the efforts in content protection technologies were focused on
stopping easy consumer copies, and hence to “keep honest people honest”. It has always
been very clear that stopping professional pirates or even determined consumers would be a
very hard task. Video pirates have a lot of professional equipment at their disposal and in
their possession that make it easy to create bit-to-bit copies of discs, or to generate high-qual-
ity masters for mass replication.
Given this history, and the fact that the protection systems for DVD did not last very long,
it does not come as a surprise that a great deal of effort has been put into the renewability of
the content protection systems for Blu-ray. The revocation systems within AACS, and the
additional renewable protection mechanisms through BD+ are two examples of this
improved security. Additional watermarking opportunities provide further enhancements for
Blu-ray that allow a forensic analysis of where the pirated content originates. But it does not
stop at the protection from casual copying, for there are also attempts to stop professional
pirates with the BD-ROM Mark technology. It is probably a false hope to expect these tech-
nologies to entirely stop digital copies of the content, and it has already been proven that
such copies can be created but, at least, they provide a means to close security holes and pro-

tect future titles with improved security. As a result, a continuous cat-and-mouse game
between studios and pirates is guaranteed.
Besides the technological aspects to prevent illegal copies, the movie studios have started
addressing the serious issue of piracy on the legal level. Dating back to 1994, they started pro-
moting the idea of making it illegal to defeat technical content protection measures, which
resulted in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty, the
WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (December 1996), and the compliant US
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in October 1998. With this legislation, process-
es and devices that circumvent content protection are now illegal in the United States and
many other countries.
Although the major studios consider content protection one of the most important issues,
many smaller, independent studios do not necessarily share this point of view. Many of the
smaller studios or commercial content producers may not mind if their content is being
copied. In fact, some of them may even encourage copying, as it provides an additional audi-
ence. Although it was at the content producer’s liberty to decide whether or not the disc was
protected for DVD-Video, this situation changes for Blu-ray. AACS and BD-ROM Mark are
mandatory features that everybody has to adhere to. As a result, smaller content producers
now have to sign various agreements. Each of the agreements are associated with certain
license fees to release content in the BD format. That obviously raises the bar for some pro-
ducers to get involved in this format, and may even prevent some of them from releasing con-
tent at all. Whether or not this situation will prevent Blu-ray from gaining the market accep-
tance that DVD did is a heavily discussed topic on numerous levels. It remains to be seen
whether the content protection obligations take priority or the necessity of mandatory pro-
tection for certain types of content will change in the future to address this problem.
Region Playback Control [RPC]
Control over geographic distribution of packaged media content became an important
issue for motion picture studios with the introduction of DVD-Video. Region playback con-
trol (RPC) provides a tool to manage the release of home video content in different regions
of the world. As an example, a movie may already have been released on video in the United
States when it is just beginning to play in theatres in Europe. However, release windows have
gotten shorter and technology has made it easier to debut movies worldwide, so this exclu-
sivity is less common nowadays. A more typical scenario is exclusive local content distribu-
tion agreements. For example, the studio distributing a movie in the United States may not
be the same studio with the rights to distribute the movie in other parts of the world. Region
playback control is designed to support this business model.
The original implementation of region control for DVD-Video defined a set of seven
region codes to allow or prevent playback of a disc in each region (plus a special region for
airplanes, hotels, and the like). Each DVD player is set to the code of the region where it is
sold. Each DVD contains flags to define which regions where it will play. A disc can allow
any combination of regions. The player is only allowed to play a disc when its own region
Content Protection, Licensing, and Patents

code matches the corresponding flag in the disc. Region codes on DVD players, including
PCs, are mandatory, but region codes on discs are optional. Discs without region codes play
in any country, although 525/60 (NTSC) discs require a player that can convert to 625/50
(PAL) output and vice versa.
Blu-ray takes a similar path but specifies only three regions — A, B, and C (see Figure 4.6
and Table 4.2, also see Table B.9 for a complete list of countries).
The most remarkable change in the constellation of countries for each Blu-ray region is
that the United States, Japan, and South Korea (countries producing a significant portion of
players), are all part of the same region, whereas with DVD-Video they were in separate
regions. As with DVD, each Blu-ray player must be permanently coded for a single region.
Each Blu-ray disc can be set to play in one, two, or all three regions. Region playback con-
trol is intended to apply only to pre-recorded (BD-ROM) discs — the license prohibits
region-checking code on recordable discs. Logos on the players and discs indicate their
region settings (see Figure 12.7). Of course Blu-ray players are also set to one of the DVD
regions for DVD region playback control.
Another key difference for Blu-ray is that the disc itself, not the player, must manage
region playback control with HDMV or BD-J code that checks the player setting and takes

action, such as limiting access to some of the content, playing different content, putting up a
warning, or stopping all playback. Player manufacturers are explicitly obligated (by the Blu-
ray format license) to stop playback if the disc requests it.
Implementation of region playback control on a computer is more difficult than on a
standalone player since two components, a drive and a software player, have to work togeth-
er, yet the components are sold independently and worldwide. The initial DVD computer
implementations mostly had ROM drives with no built-in region code, so the software play-
er application or the operating system was responsible for maintaining the region code. After
2000, all DVD drive manufacturers were required to produce drives that maintain the region
code in their firmware. The user has the chance to change the region code up to five times.
Having the region managed by the drive hardware rather than the software added more secu-
rity to the system.
For Blu-ray the burden shifted back to the computer operating system and/or player appli-
cation software, which must allow the user to change the region up to five times but other-
wise must maintain the region code setting (and the count of changes) across uninstall/rein-
stall cycles and must be designed to prevent users from tampering with the software to alter
the region code or defeat the feature.
It didn’t take long for workarounds to appear with both DVD and Blu-ray. As soon as the
first DVD players were released, people figured out how the region coding could be reset to
“region 0”1— by a switch on a circuit board, a combination of keypresses on the remote con-
trol, replacing the firmware with a “modded” chip, or some other innovative way to defeat
the system. There are dozens of legitimate vendor outlets, especially on the Internet, where
code-free DVD players can be purchased. In response to code-free players, some studios
designed discs with specific program code to query the region setting of the player. If a play-
er was set to more than one region, the disc would refuse to play. Not surprisingly, this
endeavor did not last long either — the next multi-region products were released with switch-
able region codes.
The same cat and mouse game is being played with Blu-ray regions. This time the Blu-ray
license includes specific conditions stating that players cannot include switches, buttons, cir-
cuit-board jumpers or traces, or player functions to change the region or defeat the region
playback control function. This covers software players as well. Nevertheless, by the end of
2007 multi-region players (with modified firmware) were available. In addition, hacking
instructions were soon posted on the Internet, giving details on how to reset the region
change count in computer Blu-ray player software applications, allowing unlimited region
changes.
Given the ability of BD-J code to examine the state of the player, especially in conjunction
with BD+, it is inevitable that content owners who care about region control will make discs
that attempt to recognize multi-region players. The funny thing is most of the Hollywood stu-
dios don’t care about region control the way they used to. Business models and release pat-
terns have changed since DVD came out. A look at the list of Blu-ray Discs maintained at
blurayregioncodes.com (766 discs as of September 2008) showed that only 30 percent

had region codes. In fact, the only major studios that had more region-coded discs than
region-free discs were Fox (95 percent region coded, representing one third of the entire list
of region-coded discs), Disney (including Miramax and Buena Vista, at 56 percent) and
MGM (77 percent, although ironically MGM is controlled by Sony, yet only 24 percent of
Sony Picture titles were region coded). Notably, every Paramount and Universal release was
all-region, and all of the 133 Warner titles were all-region, apart from a handful of New Line
titles.
Region codes can’t be changed on BD-ROM discs, but they can be removed from a copy.
Software utilities are available on the Internet to copy discs and strip out region coding.
Some even claim to remove BD-based region detection, which requires analyzing and mod-
ifying the BD-J code.
There are arguments that region codes are an illegal restraint of trade, although no legal
cases have been made. An important point is that while player manufacturers are obligated
by their Blu-ray format license to implement region playback control, there are no laws
requiring it. More importantly, circumventing region playback control is, in practically every
case, perfectly legal for consumers, retailers, and others.2 In fact, countries such as Australia,
New Zealand, and Switzerland have legal provisions that allow circumvention of regional
coding or access controls, and the European Commission stated in 2007 that it was allowed.
Only Japan, the United States, and South Korea have bodies of law that could arguably make
it illegal to circumvent region coding.
For the typical consumer, none of this really matters. Players and discs bought from local
stores or from domestic Internet retailers will work perfectly together. Region mismatch is
primarily an issue for those who buy imported discs from other regions or who move from
one region to another. But again, the good news for those who may be adversely affected by
region coding is that it’s not nearly as prevalent on Blu-ray discs as it was on DVDs.
Licensing
No single company “owns” Blu-ray. The official format specification was developed ini-
tially by a founding group of nine companies — Hitachi, LG, Panasonic, Pioneer, Philips,
Samsung, Sharp, Sony, and Thomson. Multi-company groups within the Blu-ray Disc
Association worked on different parts of the BD specifications. Although people around the
world have contributed to the Blu-ray format, it is not an international standard in the for-
mal sense. It is an open specification, in that anyone can sign the proper agreements to get a
copy of the technical documents, but use of the format and related logo is strictly controlled
and comes with obligations for testing and certification as well as implementing selected con-
tent protection systems and region playback control. The Blu-ray format specification books
are only available from the Blu-ray Disc Association after signing an information agreement,
which includes confidentiality obligations, and paying a $2500 fee for the first book, $1500
for the second book, and $1000 for each additional book. These fees must be paid again each
year or the books must be returned.

2The authors of this book are not lawyers, and they don’t even play them on television. So anyone relying on
this book for legal advice will not get much more than poetic justice.

Anyone who manufactures Blu-ray Disc products (media, players, PC drives, or PC soft-
ware) must sign a format and logo license agreement (FLLA). There are different agree-
ments for each format (ROM, R, RE, and AVCREC), each with a one-time fee of $15,000
for a five-year term, although the maximum for combined fees is $30,000. The agreements
include content protection obligations (CPO) that mandate the use of certain content pro-
tection systems, as shown in Table 4.3. The BDA may choose to add a new content protec-
tion system at any time, in which case manufacturers have 24 months to implement the new
system. Those who simply want to use the Blu-ray Disc logo for promotion of products may
do so after signing the free Logo License Agreement (LLA).
Content providers must sign a separate content participant agreement (CPA) and pay
$3000 per year per format (BD-ROM, BD-RE, BD-R, and AVCREC, BD-Live) in order to
release content on Blu-ray discs. There is a “light” version of the agreement that omits third-
party beneficiary rights — the ability to participate in a lawsuit against a Blu-ray licensee if
they breach the terms of the agreement, which basically boils down to the licensee doing
something that allows the content provider’s product to be illegally copied.
The format and logo license does not convey any patent royalties, which are claimed by
many companies, some of whom have banded together and pooled their patents to make
licensing easier, but there is still a bewildering array of companies holding out their hands for
their slice of royalties (see Table 4.4). MPEG LA formed a one-stop-shopping pool of all
essential Blu-ray technology patents, including interactivity and downloaded content, but as
of late 2008 they had not yet finalized the licensing program, and not all relevant patent hold-
ers were necessarily on board. The Blu-ray Disc Association provides comprehensive format
and logo licensing and content protection system licensing information on their Website
(www.blu-raydisc.info), but no patent licensing information.

lios for AVC/H.264 and VC-1. Via Licensing (a subsidiary of Dolby) covers patents for DVB-
MHP (which may apply to GEM as part of BD-J).3 Sun Microsystems charges per-unit roy-
alties for its reference implementation of Java and the technology compatibility kits (TCKs)
needed to validate BD-J implementations. Alternative Java implementations are available
from other suppliers such as IBM. AACS charges per disc and also per title for encryption
keys. BD+ Licensing LLC, not surprisingly, handles BD+ licensing. BD-ROM Mark licens-
ing can be obtained from Panasonic, Philips, or Sony. Patent royalties may be owed to
Discovision Associates, which owns about 1300 optical disc patents going back to laserdisc
days, but many are expiring. 
Essentially all BD players can play DVDs, which requires format and logo licenses from
the DVD Format and Logo Licensing Corporation (FLLC) and patent licenses from a
Hitachi, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp, Toshiba, Victor (JVC), and Warner
pool (known as 6C for the original 6 companies), from an LG, Philips, Pioneer, and Sony
pool (administered by Philips but known as 3C since there were originally three companies),
and from Thomson (jokingly referred to as the “1C pool”).4 DVD disc royalties are paid by
the replicator. Some BD recorders (video recorders or PC writers) can also record to DVD-
R/RW, DVD+R/RW, and DVD-RAM, which have associated format and patent licenses.
Philips and Sony charge per-disc royalties for DVD+R/RW. Royalties for DVD+R/RW
devices are covered by 3C fees. Implementation of the DVD-RAM specification incurs no
royalties so long as no patented technologies are used. Many DVD players are also Video
CD (VCD) players. Philips licenses the Video CD format and patents (which also cover
Super Video CD) on behalf of itself, France Telecom, IRT, JVC, Panasonic, and Sony.
All the pools give licensees the choice to negotiate directly with each patent holder rather
than with the agent for the pool. This allows for cross-licensing programs, where companies
agree to license patent rights to each other at little or no cost instead of each paying money
to the other. This is good for companies with cross licenses but hard on companies without
any patents, since they have to pay full royalty fees. One bit of overall good news is that many
of the newer technology license programs include caps, where payments stop after a few mil-
lion dollars.

Chapter 5
Physical Disc Formats
CDs and DVDs are marvels of modern technology, storing data as dots smaller than a
human hair whizzing past a laser at hundreds of kilometers per hour. Blu-ray Discs™(BD)
are even more complicated to produce because of their thinner data layer and smaller pit
structure chararacteristics. More care needs to be taken to properly replicate the pits and to
bond the substrates together.
Table 5.1 lists the physical characteristics of the Blu-ray Discs. Most of these characteris-
tics are shared by all the physical formats (read-only, writable, 12 centimeter and 8 centime-
ter). Blu-ray discs are similar to DVDs and HD DVDs but with different substrate thick-
nesses (see Figure 5.1). The data substrate, often called the cover layer, is 0.1 mm thick, and
the other substrate is 1.1 mm thick. The thin cover layer allows the laser to converge more
sharply1 without undue aberration from disc tilt2. This leads to smaller spot sizes and thus
higher data density compared to DVD or HD DVD. Minor variations in pit length on the
disc result in three slightly different capacities (see Table 5.2).

1Convergence performance of an objective lens is expressed as a unitless number called numerical aperture
(NA), calculated as the sine of the half angle of convergence. The diameter of converging light is inversely
proportional to the NA. That is, D = λ / NA, where λ = wavelength (405 nm, in this case). The larger the NA,
the smaller the convergence.
2Think of looking at reeds in a pond. If you look straight down, the reeds look normal, but if you look at an
angle, the reeds seem fractured at the point they penetrate the surface of the water because of light refrac-
tion. Likewise, a laser beam passing through the plastic material of a disc is distorted if it doesn’t enter at a
perfectly perpendicular angle, and the thicker the plastic the more severe the aberration.

Since the laser does not read through the backing substrate it does not have to be clear. It
can even be made from non-plastic material such as paper or corn starch. It is theoretically
possible to make a two-sided, three substrate BD with a 1.0-mm middle substrate sandwiched
between two 0.1-mm cover layers, but this is not covered in the format specification.
A standard feature of BD is a 2-nanometer hardcoat at the readout surface to protect the
disc from fingerprints and scratches. Think of it as transparent Teflon. Hard coatings can be
applied to DVD, as well.
Blu-ray discs can optionally use a cartridge to protect the disc (see Figure 5.2). There are
two types of cartridge — sealed (from which the disc cannot be removed) and open (allow-
ing the disc to be removed and replaced.) The original BD-RE 1.0 format used a sealed car-
tridge, but since hardcoat technology was adopted, the BDA recommends that cartridges
should not be used for any of the BD formats except in special situations.

BD-ROM Mastering
Different technologies are used for creating BD masters. One technology is phase-transi-
tion metal (PTM) mastering that uses a 405-nm laser to create a pattern in inorganic photo-
resist material similar to that used for phase-transition recordable DVD-RW and BD-RE.
The PTM layers are placed on a silicon wafer instead of a glass plate. One advantage to PTM
is that the pickup head can monitor the creation of pit patterns as they are created so that
adjustments can be made in real time. Another approach is to modify a laser beam recorder
(LBR) to use liquid immersion, where a stream of liquid is injected in front of the recording
head and retrieved behind it. The interface created by the liquid in contact with the record-
ing lens and the master surface allows a deep-UV laser to create a sufficiently small spot size
for BD-ROM. A third approach uses an electron beam recorder (EBR) to expose a photo-
resist layer. Electron beam recording can take hours to cut a master, but researchers are
making progress on enhanced photo-resists material to speed up the process to make it more
commercially viable. Regardless of the approach, the resulting masters are used to create
stampers for replication.
BD-ROM Composition and Production
BD-ROM discs are created, complete with tracks of pits holding data, by a stamping
process. There are two basic approaches to producing Blu-ray discs: 1) transfer a data pat-
tern to a 0.1 mm layer (typically by molding a PMMA base, injecting polycarbonate, then
peeling off the PMMA) and bonding it to a 1.1 mm substrate, and 2) injection-molding a pat-
tern directly on top of a 1.1 mm substrate, then adding a cover layer. The latter method,
which is more popular, includes approaches to forming the cover layer such as 1) spin-coat-
ing the cover with an ultraviolet (UV) resin, 2) bonding a pre-made cover sheet with a UV
resin, and 3) bonding a pre-made cover sheet with pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) (see
Figure 5.3). The resin coating process spins the disc to spread the resin from the hub to the

es require tight tolerances when manufacturing the sheets and performing the bonding.

BD-RE Composition
Blu-ray rewritable discs have a structure similar to Blu-ray read-only (BD-ROM) discs
(see Table 5.3). They are produced using one or two phase-change recording layers with a
high-frequency modulated groove to provide addressing information and speed control for
the recorder. Wobble period is approximately 5 μm, with embedded addresses in address in
pregroove (ADIP) units of 56 wobbles. ADIP information is stored using minimum-shift-key-
ing (MSK) modulation and saw-tooth wobble (STW). Data is written in the groove rather
than on the land between.
BD-R Composition
Blu-ray write-once discs are similar to Blu-ray rewritable (BD-RE) discs, although the
recording layers can be formulated with organic dye, inorganic alloys such as Si/Cu, or write-
once phase-change material (see Table 5.4). Data can be written in the groove or on the
groove (on the land between).

BD Error Correction
Error correction is the same for all BD formats. Data is recorded in 64K partitions, called
clusters, each containing 32 data frames with 2048 bytes of user data each. 64KB clusters are
protected by two error-correction mechanisms. The first is a long-distance code (LDC) using
Reed-Solomon (RS) in a (248, 216, 33) structure. The second error-correction mechanism
multiplexes the data with a burst indicator subcode (BIS) using (62, 30, 33) Reed-Solomon
codewords. BIS includes addressing information and application-dependent control data
information (18 bytes per data frame). BIS pinpoints long burst errors that can then be
removed to improve LDC error correction.

A data frame holds 2048 bytes of user data and 4 bytes of simple error-detection code
(EDC) for a total of 2052 bytes. Each data frame is scrambled to spread the bits around.
Then, 32 data frames are combined into a data block with 216 rows of 304 columns. Each col-
umn is one byte. A data block is extended into an LDC block by appending the LDC codes
for the data block as 32 rows of 304 columns. The LDC block is internally interleaved and
shifted to improve burst error correction, resulting in an LDC cluster of 152 columns and 496
rows.
The 64KB physical cluster is divided into 16 address units (AU). The 4-byte address unit
numbers are derived from the physical sector numbers and together with 1 byte of flags, 4
bytes of error correction, and user control data, they make up the data used for the BIS,
which goes through a RS (62, 30, 33) coding and is arranged into a BIS cluster of 496 rows
by 3 columns.
The LDC cluster is split into four groups of 38 columns, and each of the three columns
from the BIS cluster is inserted between them, forming an ECC cluster. An additional col-
umn of frame sync bits is added at the beginning of the ECC cluster and DC control bits are
inserted to form a recording frame of 496 rows by 155 columns, also called a physical cluster. 
BD Data Modulation
Data in a recording frame, except for the sync bits, are modulated using the 1-7PP tech-
nique, an RLL (1, 7) code (2T through 8T run lengths) where the first P stands for parity pre-
serve and the second P stands for prohibit repeated minimum transition run length (RMTR).
Parity preserve means that the parity of the data stream matches the parity of the modulat-
ed stream. That is, if the number of ones in the selected chunk of data is even, then the num-
ber of ones in the modulated bits is even, and the same if the number of ones is odd. This is
an efficient way to control the low-frequency content of the recorded signal. Prohibit RMTR
limits the number of consecutive minimum run lengths (2T) to six, which avoids low signal
levels and improves readout performance. A modulation conversion table is used to map
sequences of data bits to modulation bits, which are then converted to a non-return to zero
inverted (NRZI) channel bit stream that is recorded on the disc.
BD-R/RE Recording
The smallest unit for recording data is a recording unit block (RUB) consisting of 2,760
channel bits of run-in, followed by a 64KB physical cluster, followed by 1,104 channel bits of
run-out. A continuously written sequence of one or more RUBs is terminated with a guard_3
field of 504 channel bits. The run-in and run-out provide buffers so that clusters can be ran-
domly written and rewritten, and to allow for start position shift (SPS), which randomly shifts
the start position of each recording sequence by up to 128 channel bits before or 127 chan-
nel bits after the nominal start position to help the recording material last longer through
multiple overwrites of the same data.
The lead-in at the beginning of the disc contains a pre-embossed section, called the per-
manent information and control data (PIC) zone, followed by a rewritable section. The PIC
Physical Disc Formats
5 - 8
5
Blu-ray Disc Demystified

zone holds general information about the disc and includes a special section called the emer-
gency brake (EB). Up to 62 emergency brake fields can be defined, which specify a drive man-
ufacturer, drive model, and firmware version, with associated special handling procedures to
avoid damage to the drive or disc. The rewritable section is used for optimum power control
(OPC) tasks and to store information about the recorded data on the disc, including defect
management information, physical access control, and drive-specific information. Discs must
be initialized before use, which largely consists of creating a defect list, if any.
BD-R/RE Defect Management
Defect management during recording can be handled by the file system or by the drive. If
the drive manages defects, it maps defective clusters using linear replacement and a single
defect list into one or two optional spare areas per layer. The inner spare area of layer 0 is at
the inner side of the data zone and has a fixed size of 4,096 physical clusters (256 megabytes).
The outer spare area of layer 0 and the inner spare area of layer 1 each have a variable size
of 0 to 16,384 clusters (1,024 megabytes). The outer spare area of layer 1 has a variable size
of 0 to 8,192 clusters (512 megabytes). The total spare areas represent about 5 percent of the
storage capacity of the disc. If the drive detects a defective physical cluster it may replace the
cluster, mark it for future replacement, mark it as defective without replacement, or ignore
the error.
Phase-Change Recording
Phase-change recording technology, used for BD-R and BD-RE, as well as other optical
recording technologies such as CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, depends on
changes in reflectivity between the amorphous state and the crystalline state of special alloys.
When the alloy is heated by a laser at low power (bias) to reach a temperature around 200°C
(400°F), it melts and crystallizes into a state of high reflectivity. When the alloy is heated by
the laser at high power (peak) to a temperature between 500 and 700°C (900 and 1300°F), it
melts and then cools rapidly to an amorphous state in which the randomized atom placement
causes low reflectivity. As the disc rotates under the laser, it writes marks with high-power
pulses and “erases” between the marks with low-power pulses. The marks can then be read
with a much lower power setting to sense the difference in reflectivity (see Figure 5.4).

Figure 5.4  Phase-Change Recording

Phase-change discs are made of a polymer substrate to which a recording layer and a pro-
tective lacquer are applied. The recording layer is a sandwich of four thin films: the lower
dielectric film, the recording film, the upper dielectric film, and the reflective film. The upper
and lower dielectric films rapidly draw heat away from the recording layer to create the 10-
second supercooling effect needed to keep it from returning to a crystalline state. The
recording film is composed of an alloy such as germanium, antimony, and tellurium (Ge-Sb-
Te) or indium, silver, antimony, and tellurium (In-Ag-Sb-Te). The dielectric layers are made
of a material such as zinc sulfide and silicon dioxide (ZnS-SiO2). The reflective film is usu-
ally aluminum or gold.
Burst Cutting Area (BCA)
A section near the hub of the disc, called the burst cutting area (BCA), optionally can be
used for individualizing discs, usually during the manufacturing process. The BCA applies to
all BD formats — BD-ROM, BD-R, and BD-RE. A strong laser is used to cut a series of
low-reflectance stripes, somewhat like a barcode, to store simple information such as ID
codes or serial numbers. The BCA sits in the ring from 21.0 to 22.2 mm from the center of
the disc (Figure 5.5). The BCA is only written on layer 0.
The BCA holds up to 64 bytes of information, broken into four 16-byte chunks (Data
Units). The BCA can be read by the same laser pickup head that reads the disc. BCA infor-
mation can be used for inventory purposes or by storage systems, such as, disc jukeboxes, to

quickly identify discs. The BCA is used on rewritable discs to store information about the disc
so the drive can very quickly determine the type of disc. One Data Unit of the BCA on
recordable discs therefore contains information about the disc type (recordable or
rewritable), size (120mm or 80mm), specification version, structure (single or dual layer),
and channel bit length (80, 74.5, or 69nm).
The BCA is also used in AACS recording to uniquely encrypt the data on a recordable disc
so that it can be decrypted only with the key stored in the BCA. Manufacturers of AACS-
compatible recordable media write a unique serial number in the BCA of each disc. (See
Chapter 4 for more on AACS recording.)
Source Identification Codes (SID)
Two different marks, usually legible strings of letters and numbers, are placed near the hub
of a Blu-ray Disc to identify the facility where the disc is made. The Mastering Code is writ-
ten by the mastering recorder along with the pit structure that is transferred to the stamper.
The Mold Code is placed on the back of the mold used in the stamping process. The marks
then appear on all discs manufactured with that combination of stamper and mold.
Hybrid Discs
The Blu-ray format includes Hybrid discs, which are a combination of layers in BD, DVD,
and CD format. More specifically, the following formats are accounted for — BD-ROM,
BD-R, BD-RE, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, CD-ROM, CD-R,
and CD-RW. Intra-hybrid discs use two mixed BD layers, such as, a BD-ROM layer and a
BD-R layer. Inter-Hybrid discs use a BD layer and either a CD or a DVD layer. All Hybrid
discs are single sided, which means they have a normal label side and, in all cases, there is
one semitransparent BD layer so that the layer behind it (CD, DVD, or BD) can be read or
recorded.
Unfortunately, as of the BD 1.01 (December 2005) specification, most of the interesting
combinations are not allowed, but they could be supported in the future. Only the two com-
binations of BD-ROM + CD-ROM and BD-ROM + DVD-ROM are allowed.
Media Storage and Longevity
BDs can be stored and used in a surprisingly wide range of environments (see Tables 5.1,
5.2, and 5.3, for recommended temperature and humidity ranges). You can keep them in
your refrigerator or in your hot water heater, although neither of these storage methods is a
recommended alternative to a sturdy shelf or cabinet. A cool, dry storage environment is best
for long-term data protection. If a disc has been kept in an environment significantly differ-
ent from the operating environment, it should be conditioned in the operating environment
for at least two hours before use.
BDs are quite stable, and if treated well, they usually will last longer than the person who
Physical Disc Formats

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

owns them. Estimating the lifetime of a storage medium is a complex process that relies on
simulated aging and statistical extrapolations. Based on accelerated aging tests and past
experience with optical media, the consensus is that replicated discs will last from 50 to 300
years.
Organic-dye-based discs, such as, some types of BD-R discs, are expected to last from 20
to 250 years, about as long as CD-R discs3. Shelf life before recording is about 10 years. The
primary factor in the lifespan of these BD-R discs is aging of the organic dye material, which
can change its absorbance properties. Long-term storage of this type of BD-Rs should be in
a relatively dark environment, because the dyes are photosensitive, especially to blue or UV
light (both of which are present in sunlight). Cyanine media are more susceptible than
phthalocyanine media. Anecdotal reports have circulated of CD-R and DVD-R discs “wear-
ing out” after being played for long periods of time, ostensibly because of alteration in the
dye caused by reading it with a laser, but there are counter-reports of discs that play in kiosks
24 hours a day for years without a hitch.
The phase-change format (BD-RE and some BD-R) discs are expected to last from 25 to
100 years. The primary factor in the lifespan of these discs is the chemical tendency of phase-
change alloys to separate and aggregate, thus reducing their ability to hold state. This also
limits the number of times a disc can be rewritten.
In all cases, longevity can be reduced by materials of poor quality or a shoddy manufac-
turing process. Pressed BDs of inferior quality may deteriorate within a few years, and cheap
recordable BDs may produce errors during recording or become unreadable soon after
recording.
For comparison, magnetic media (tapes and disks) last 10 to 30 years; high-quality, acid-
neutral paper can last a hundred years or longer; and archival-quality microfilm is projected
to last 300 years or more.
Remember that computer storage media often become technically obsolete within 20 to
30 years, long before they physically deteriorate. In other words, long before the discs
become nonviable, it may become difficult or impossible to find the equipment to read them.
BDs may be subject to “laser rot” — oxidation of the reflective layer. Media types such as
dual-layer discs and BD-Rs that use gold for the reflective layer are not susceptible to oxi-
dation because gold is a stable element.
Handling and Storage
Handle discs only by the hub or outer edge. Do not touch the shiny surface with your pop-
corn-greasy fingers. Store the disc in a protective case when not in use. Do not bend the disc
when taking it out of the case, and be careful not to scratch the disc when placing it in the
case or in the player tray. Make certain that the disc is seated properly in the player tray
before you close it.
Keep discs away from radiators/heaters, hot equipment surfaces, direct sunlight (near a
window or in a car during hot weather), pets, small children, and other destructive forces.

3Kodak officially states that its CD-R media will last 100 years if stored properly. Testing by Kodak engineers
indicates that 95 percent of the discs should last 217 years.

Magnetic fields have no effect on DVDs or BDs. The format specifications recommend that
discs be stored at a temperature between 20 and 50°C (4 and 122°F) with less than 15°C
(59°F) variation per hour at a relative humidity of 5 to 90 percent.
Coloring the outside edge of a BD with a green marker (or any other color) makes no dif-
ference in video or audio quality. Data is read based on pit interference at one-quarter of the
laser wavelength, a distance of less than 102 nanometers. A bit of dye that, on average, is
more than 4 million times farther away is not going to affect anything.
Care and Feeding of Discs
Because BDs are read by a laser, they are resistant — to a point — to fingerprints, dust,
smudges, and scratches. However, surface contaminants and scratches can cause data errors.
On a video player, the effect of data errors ranges from minor video artifacts to frame skip-
ping to complete unplayability. Therefore, it is a good idea to take care of your discs. In gen-
eral, treat them the same way as you would a CD.
Your player cannot be harmed by a scratched or dirty disc unless there are globs of nasty
substances on it that might actually hit the lens. Still, it is best to keep your discs clean, which
also will keep the inside of your player clean. Never attempt to play a cracked disc because
it could shatter and damage the player. It probably does not hurt to leave a disc in the play-
er (even if it is paused and still spinning), but leaving the player running unattended for long
periods of time is not advisable.
In general, there is no need to clean the lens on your player, since the air moved by the
rotating disc keeps it clean. However, if you commonly use a lens cleaning disc in your CD
player, you may want to do the same with your BD players. It is best to only use a cleaning
disc designed for BD players because there are minor differences in lens positioning.
There is no need for periodic alignment of the pickup head. Sometimes the laser can drift
out of alignment, especially after rough handling of the player, but this is not a regular main-
tenance item.
Cleaning and Repairing Discs
If you notice problems when playing a disc, you may be able to correct them with a simple
cleaning. Do not use strong cleaners, abrasives, solvents, or acids. With a soft, lint-free cloth,
wipe gently in only a radial direction (in a straight line between the hub and the rim). Since
the data is arranged circularly on the disc, the microscratches you create when cleaning the
disc will cross more error correction blocks and be less likely to cause unrecoverable errors.
Do not use canned or compressed air, which can be very cold from rapid expansion and may
stress the disc thermally.
For stubborn dirt or gummy adhesive, use water, water with mild soap, or isopropyl alco-
hol. As a last resort, try peanut oil. Let it sit for about a minute before wiping it off.
Commercial products are available to clean discs, and they provide some protection from
dust, fingerprints, and scratches. Cleaning products labeled for use on CDs work as well as
those that say they are for DVDs and BDs.
Physical Disc Formats

If you continue to have problems after cleaning the disc, you may need to attempt to repair
one or more scratches. Sometimes even hairline scratches can cause errors if they happen to
cover an entire ECC block. Examine the disc, keeping in mind that the laser reads from the
bottom. There are essentially two methods of repairing scratches: (1) fill or coat the scratch
with an optical material or (2) polish down the scratch. Many commercial products do one
or both of these, or you may wish to buy polishing compounds or toothpaste and do it your-
self. The trick is to polish out the scratch without causing new ones. A mess of small polish-
ing scratches can cause more damage than a big scratch. As with cleaning, polish only in the
radial direction.
Libraries, rental shops, and other venues that need to clean many discs may want to invest
in a commercial polishing machine that can restore a disc to pristine condition, even after an
amazing amount of abuse. Keep in mind, though, that the data layer on a BD is only one-
tenth as deep as on a CD and one-sixth of a DVD so the BD cannot be repolished too many
times.
Improvement over DVD
The storage capacity of a single-layer DVD is seven times higher than that of a CD. BD
further improves on DVD capacity by reducing the laser spot size with smaller wavelength
(2.6× increase) and a more tightly focused beam (2× increase), resulting in more than five
times the capacity.
At the reference 1× linear velocity of 4.917 m/s, Blu-ray discs spin about 1.4 times faster
than DVDs but, because of the higher data density, the data rate is 35.965 Mbps, over three
times faster than DVD’s 11.08 Mbps and over 29 times faster than CD’s 1.23 Mbps. However,
to handle the high data rate requirements of video and audio, discs are played at a minimum
of 1.5 times reference velocity, giving a data rate of 53.947 Mbps, about 4.8 times faster than
DVD.

Application Details
With the exception of disc diameter, the physical format of a Blu-ray Disc™is significant-
ly different from that of a standard DVD. With 25 GB for a single layer, and 50 GB for a dual
layer disc, a Blu-ray Disc (BD) holds more than five times the data of a DVD. There are for-
mat variations that provide applications for pre-recorded discs (BD-ROM), recordable discs
(BD-R), and re-writable discs (BD-RE).
When DVD was introduced, it took a few months after the release of DVD-ROM discs
for DVD recorders to appear in the marketplace, but the progression was reversed for Blu-
ray. BD Recorders for the BD-RE re-writable format were introduced in the Japanese mar-
ket starting in 2003, significantly earlier than the first BD-ROM discs, which shipped in 2006.
The initial BD recorder applications targeted recording and playback of Japanese digital
broadcast signals, and an update of the BD-RE specification was required in order to ensure
compatibility with the subsequent BD-ROM application formats and other video recording
formats.
The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) controls all of the BD formats and applications and
ensures that they are all compatible. In order to do that objectively, the BDA is composed of
a Board of Directors along with different committees, as described in Figure 6.1.
The Joint Technical Committee (JTC) is responsible for the development of the technical
specifications and is subdivided into five Technical Expert Groups (TEGs) that cover the var-
ious aspects of the format (Table 6.1).

To ensure that all products released into the market have been properly tested and are
compliant with the technical specifications, the Compliance Committee is tasked with creat-
ing test procedures for each product category. The third committee is the Promotions
Committee, which is responsible for marketing the format in various geographical locations
around the globe.
All of these committees report to the BDA’s Board of Directors (BoD), which consists of
representatives from all key contributor companies. The BoD sets the overall strategy, dis-
cusses major issues and approves key decisions.
Beyond the division into three physical formats (BD-ROM, BD-R, and BD-RE), the spec-
ification for each format is further broken down into three parts —
j the physical specifications defining various parameters of the disc,
j the file system requirements, and
j the application formats.
Though some of the specifications are continually being updated, table 6.2 lists the most
recent versions of each specification book (see Figure B.3 for a diagram of relationships).
With every new technology comes a number of acronyms that can be very intimidating and
confusing; naturally, it is no different with Blu-ray Disc. In fact, as the format evolved, about
a dozen acronyms with “BD” in the name were used, making it very difficult to stay on track
with what is being talked about. To help with some of these acronyms, table 6.3 deciphers the
BD alphabet soup.

BDAV
The Blu-ray format for recordable discs is called BDAV (Blu-ray Disc Audio Visual). Its
primary purpose is the recording of digital broadcast content in high-definition on record-
able and rewritable Blu-ray Discs (BD-R, BD-RE). Unlike DVD, the BD recordable format
was introduced prior to the introduction of the BD-ROM pre-recorded format. With that in
mind, it is understandable that Blu-ray uses MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS) technology for
BDAV rather than the MPEG-2 Program Streams (PS) technology that is used for DVD.
The advantage of using transport streams is that much smaller packet sizes (188-bytes) are
capable of multiplexing multiple channels as well as providing additional information, such
as, electronic program guides (EPG). This makes transport streams far more suitable for
broadcast applications. Given the BDAV format’s main purpose as a recording format for
digital broadcast, it provides the means to extract, record, and play partial transport streams
that were composed from multiplexed full transport streams (digital broadcasts) containing
several channels of content.
In addition to the primary intent of recording digital broadcasts, the BDAV format sup-
ports the recording of self-encoded streams (e.g., an analog standard-definition video input)
and recording of DV video streams (e.g., a camcorder). To generate a self-encoded stream,
a built-in MPEG-2 video encoder encodes the incoming video, multiplexes it with the incom-
ing audio, and creates a valid transport stream similar to digital broadcast. Whereas, in a DV
stream, the video already exists in an MPEG-2 format and can be directly recorded without
further encoding. In that way, no quality degradation would occur.

Organizational Structure
To allow the user to seamlessly, and non-destructively, edit the recorded stream data,
BDAV provides an organizational structure that separates the physically recorded stream
from a logical playlist. Additionally, the player provides a user interface for assembling and
editing of the recorded content. Figure 6.2 outlines this organizational structure.
Interactive User Interface
Because the user wants to be in control of the navigation and the behavior of the record-
ed disc, each individual player implementation provides a user interface for establishing that
control.
Playlist
There are two types of playlists defined in the BDAV format — a real playlist and a virtu-
al playlist. A real playlist has a one-to-one correspondence to the clips on the disc. The
enduser can also create a virtual playlist as part of editing the recorded content. Each playlist
is composed of one or more playitems. This allows a virtual playlist to refer to multiple por-
tions of existing clips on the disc, each portion being defined as a separate playitem. In the
end, multiple playitems can be tied together into a single virtual playlist for seamless play-
back.
Clip
Each clip contains two components — the physical Clip AV stream data and a corre-
sponding Clip Information file. There is also a playlist created for each recorded clip, con-
taining a single playitem. When the content is being edited, and a virtual playlist is created,
the physical stream data of a clip is not changed. Instead, the virtual playlist refers to the
desired portion of each clip to allow seamless playback. In order to fully support the seam-

less playback from one playitem to another playitem in the virtual playlist, it is sometimes
necessary to create a bridge clip, which requires the re-recording of a small portion of record-
ed clips.
BDMV
To allow interoperability between the recordable BDAV format and the pre-recorded Blu-
ray Disc Movie (BDMV) format, the BDAV organizational structure was subsequently
adopted as the basis for the organization of BDMV. For pre-recorded content, however, the
control of the navigation and user experience is not handled by the player implementation’s
user interface. Instead, the content producer is in control, which results in a more sophisti-
cated application layer for BDMV content.
The BDMV format is used for pre-recorded discs and is built on the same key technolo-
gies as the BDAV recording format. On the lowest level, an MPEG-2 transport stream is
used together with corresponding clip information and playlist files as described for BDAV.
The biggest difference between the formats is the necessity of a more enriched and sophis-
ticated user interface for BDMV discs. The reason is simply that the user interface for a
recordable disc is created and driven by the recorder itself, which guarantees a similar inter-
face for each disc, regardless of the content being recorded. While this is desirable for
recordable discs to keep the user environment recognizable, it would be less than desirable
for pre-recorded discs. Instead, the content owner wants to create a unique user interface for
each disc to match the look and feel of the content.
The BDMV directory represents the root level of the pre-recorded disc and contains all of
the necessary files for a player to render the audio/video presentation material and for the
user to navigate through the logic of the disc (Figure 6.3).
First of all, the index.bdmv and the MovieObject.bdmv files identify the basic orga-
nization of the disc, listing all titles with the corresponding Movie Objects.
Secondly, a number of sub-directories exist containing the actual data to be rendered. As
mentioned before, the PLAYLIST, CLIPINF, and STREAM directories are very similar to the
BDAV disc structure in the sense that they contain the actual AV stream data with the cor-
responding clip information and playlists.
In addition, the AUXDATA directory is used to hold auxiliary data, such as, any OpenType
fonts or any sound effects that will be used on the disc. The META directory contains option-
al metadata that may be used for Disc Library or Search features in certain Blu-ray players.
If the disc is programmed with BD-J features, the BDJO and JAR folders hold the BD-J
Objects (BDJO) and Java Archive (JAR) elements, respectively.  And, to ensure that not
everything is lost in case some critical files are damaged on the disc, the BACKUP directory
contains a copy of those critical files (e.g., playlists, clip information, and others).

Presentation Data
Even though the clip AV data is stored in the same format as BDAV content — in MPEG-
2 transport streams — BDMV allows a greater variety of audio and video codecs and other
associated parameters for BDMV discs. This ultimately affords content producers more flex-
ibility in choosing the right presentation environment for their content. Table 6.4 outlines
some general characteristics of the BDMV format.
Similar to the content presentation method of DVD, the various elementary streams
(video, audio, subtitle) for Blu-ray have to be multiplexed together to create a contiguous
stream that allows for seamless playback within the player. The reason for this is the fact that
a decoder will only read small chunks of data at a time in order to render the output in a
timely manner. As a result, the various elementary streams are broken into smaller packets
and stitched together in a multiplexing process, as depicted in Figure 6.4.

Paths and Subpaths
The Blu-ray format introduces a new concept with the definition of a path and a subpath.
A main path typically represents the primary audio/video content on a disc, for instance, a
movie or other feature video with its corresponding audio and subtitles, while a subpath
allows for supplementary content. As an example, secondary audio or video would be defined
as a subpath. Similarly, certain types of interactive graphics (IG) streams, text-based subti-
tles, or audio for browsable slideshows could be defined as subpaths, as well.
Subpaths may also be used for picture in picture (PIP) presentations. For this feature,
there are three different PIP video stream scenarios — 
j in-mux synchronized,
j out-of-mux synchronized, and
j out-of-mux asynchronized.
The in-mux synchronized variety is a secondary video stream that is multiplexed in the
main program stream with the feature video content. It will always be synchronous with the
main feature and the position and size of the secondary video are determined and fixed dur-
ing the disc content authoring.
For a more flexible solution, an out-of-mux video stream can be used. This allows a file to
be played back from the local storage of a player (e.g., after downloading it from the network
or copying from the disc). A typical out-of-mux feature would be a director’s commentary
that is made available over the network after the disc is released. In such a case, the out-of-
mux synchronized picture in picture approach would be used, as the timing of the commen-
tary with the main feature is essential. However, there are scenarios in which the syn-
chronicity to the main feature is not important, in which case an out-of-mux asynchronous
stream approach can be used to allow the user to define when to play the picture in picture
video stream.

BD-ROM Application Types
Blu-ray offers two modes for BD-ROM application programming — HD Movie (HDMV)
and Blu-ray Disc Java (BD-J).
The more basic mode is the HD Movie (HDMV) mode, which can be described as a declar-
ative execution environment. This mode is similar to that employed for DVD-Video, with
very little support for dynamic control of the presentation. HDMV authoring requires the
content author to anticipate all possible scenarios and create all necessary graphics and menu
compositions ahead of time, along with the logic programming for determining which menu
to show when. However, HDMV authoring still provides a lot more capabilities than DVD
authoring. The advantage of a declarative environment is that it is more straightforward to
create and to verify the content, and to comply with the specifications, which ensures a more
consistent performance across the variety of player implementations.
In order to achieve a more flexible and dynamic user experience, the BD-Java (BD-J)
mode can be used. BD-J is considered a procedural environment where programming soft-
ware is written to handle different playback scenarios. BD-J is based on a number of other
standards, such as, DVB’s1 Multimedia Home Platform (MHP) standard, and provides addi-
tional application programming interfaces (APIs) specifically necessary for Blu-ray.
Essentially, BD-J programming code is a multimedia software application executed in a Java
virtual machine (JVM) that generates graphics and animations, interacts with the user, and
controls the media playback from the disc or from other storage. Because Java is a software
programming language, there is no declarative portion within the code. Even though this
allows the greatest flexibility and the most control over the content, it is not a trivial process.
In fact, the use of a software programming language for the development of rich multimedia
applications defines a rather huge paradigm shift within the industry. A comparison between
HDMV and BD-J mode is outlined in Table 6.5.

Presentation Planes
In order to present the different media types, a so-called plane model is used by both
HDMV and BD-J.  It basically uses five independent planes to render the various media
types as depicted in Figure 6.5.

Organizational Structure
With the BDMV format being based on the BDAV format, it does not come as a surprise
that the organizational structure is very similar, as well. However, the higher levels of the
BDMV format allow for much more sophistication. Further, this means that a disc can jump
back and forth between the modes, HDMV and BD-J, to allow content interaction and to
enable more flexibility. Figure 6.6 depicts the structural organization of a BDMV disc.
Application Details

6 - 1 1
Blu-ray Disc Demystified
Figure 6.6 Structural Organization of BDMV Content
These five planes are (from back to front) the background plane, the primary video plane,
the secondary video plane, the presentation graphics plane, and an interactive graphics (IG)
plane. The presentation plane is used for subtitles and graphics. However, there are subtle
differences between HDMV and BD-J modes in the way these planes are used. For instance,
the background plane can only be used in BD-J. And the IG plane will be populated by dif-
ferent applications — either HDMV interactive graphics, or BD-J graphics, both with their
own limitations.
It is important to understand this plane model or the final presentation of the disc may not
turn out as expected. As an example, if the background plane is supposed to be used to dis-
play a graphic, the video planes cannot be rendered in full screen HD resolution, as they
would fully cover the background. Hence, in order to use the background plane, the prima-
ry video needs to be scaled to a smaller image size.
Also, in the event where both primary and secondary video are displayed, the BD specifi-
cation requires one of the video planes to be full-screen HD resolution. As a result,  to dis-
play the background plane only the primary video can be used. And, since it is not possible
to switch the order of planes, whenever the secondary video is scaled up to full HD resolu-
tion, it will fully cover the primary video plane. Thus, applications where the secondary video
plays in full-screen with the primary video in a PIP window are not possible. 
Similarly, with the interactive graphics plane sitting on top of the subtitle plane, this means
that graphics displayed in the subtitle plane may be covered by other on-screen graphics in
the IG plane. Bottomline, during the design of a Blu-ray Disc, the position of the various
planes should be carefully considered to ensure the final presentation turns out as expected.

Index Table
The index table is the starting point of the disc — the highest level. It lists all the titles on
the disc with the corresponding Movie or BD-J Objects. The index table can be referenced
whenever a title or a menu is to be executed. Hence, it is called during initial playback of the
disc, during title search, and with menu call operations.
Movie and BD-J Objects
While movie objects refer to HDMV objects, BD-J objects (BDJOs) refer to Java applica-
tions. A movie object contains commands that can launch a playlist or execute other code to
navigate through the disc. Similarly, the BD-J object can also launch a playlist, and refers to
specific Java Archives (JARs) that contain the programming code to control the disc play-
back. The index table binds each movie and BD-J object to a specific title. Note that a num-
ber of titles can share the same BDJO.
Playlist
Similar to BDAV, a playlist consists of one or multiple playitems. Each playitem refers to
a physical stream file, or a so-called clip. The in and out points of the playitem do not nec-
essarily have to coincide with the start and end time of the clip. In other words, the playitem
can define a portion of a given clip. In the end, a playlist can refer to a main path and addi-
tional sub-paths and will be composed of one or multiple playitems.
Clip
While the playlist is a logical description, a clip describes a physical AV stream file and its
associated clip information data. Besides the actual MPEG-2 Transport Stream, as defined
in the BDAV specification, the clip information describes additional time map and other rel-
evant information of a transport stream (e.g., valid entry points into the stream).
Navigation Data
With an understanding of the organizational structure of the disc, it is important for the
content author to identify the tools available to navigate through this structure. This can best
be described as the next layer, on top of the presentation data — the Navigation data. It is a
collection of information that allows the content author to access the presentation data and
navigate the disc. Leaving the much more complex and flexible BD-J application program-
ming interfaces (APIs) aside, the navigation data presents a more fundamental toolset, which
can be used by the BD-J application as well.
The navigation commands are generally grouped into three categories — branch com-
mands, compare commands, and set commands. The branch commands provide the means to
link different pieces of the disc and actually physically navigate around the disc. Compare
commands allow the content author to compare various values and parameters to make fur-
ther decisions. And, the set commands allow for mathematical operations that enable the
content author to examine the current state of the player or disc, set streams, buttons, or
other elements, and calculate the next steps for navigation. Table 6.6 outlines the navigation
commands available to content authors.

The Blu-ray player has a total of 128 Player Status Registers (PSRs).  These are 32-bit reg-
isters that hold information about the current state of the player, such as, the current audio
language (PSR16), current chapter number (PSR5), and the current angle (PSR3). This
enables content authors to use commands that track the state of the disc in order to influ-
ence the behavior. As an example, if a user navigates to a scene selection page on a popup
menu, simply reading PSR5 and setting the button based on this parameter could highlight
the chapter that is currently playing. PSRs are read-only registers and cannot be directly
influenced. However, they can be set by special commands defined in the SetSystem group,
such as, the SetNVTimer command which would influence PSR9 (Timer). Similarly, the
SetStream command could influence PSR1 (Primary Audio), PSR2 (Subtitles), or PSR3
(Angle), depending on which streams are being set. Even though the total of 128 PSRs are
available only about two-dozen of them are actually useful for the content author. The oth-
ers are used for backup purposes, or are reserved for other uses (table 6.7).

Blu-ray Disc Demystified
In addition to the Player Status Registers, there are also General Purpose Registers (GPRs).
GPRs are useful for on-disc programs to keep scores, track what sections of the disc have
already been viewed, and to store user responses, and so on. There is a total of 4096 GPRs
available, each of them able to hold a 32-bit unsigned integer. In comparison with DVD,
where only 16 registers (called General Parameters) are available, this is a huge improvement
and provides much better capabilities for mathematical calculations and tracking of the disc.
User Interaction
The enduser is in the driver’s seat when it comes to navigating the disc using a remote con-
trol or other available interface device, such as a keyboard. The user decides when to change
audio or subtitle streams, when to jump to a different piece of content, and any other play-
back decision. There are generally two different ways for this decision to be made, either by
selecting the appropriate option on the on-screen menu page or by making a decision on-the-
fly from any part of the disc (menu or video) using keys on the remote control or other
device.
User Operations
Although the general control of the disc playback is based on user interaction, there is a
way for content authors to monitor these user operations. Furthermore, content authors can
mask user operations to prohibit use by the enduser. In the case where a user operation
(UO) is masked, the player module will still register the push of the respective button on the
remote control or keyboard, but it will be ignored. For instance, in order for content
providers to ensure that all trailers and warning cards at the beginning of the disc are seen,
the fast-forward and skip functions may be masked to disable them. However, the same but-
tons should work during other parts of the disc, such as, during the main feature. To accom-
plish this, the user operations can be controlled on a granular level, either for an entire
PlayList, a PlayItem, or a page of the interactive display (e.g., menu page).
There are three different categories of user operations — Title Control User Operations,
will be used to change from one title to another during playback; Playback Control User
Operations, as one might guess, control the playback engine, such as, forward and backward
play, or changing streams; and, Interactive User Operations, which controls the navigation
through the interactive graphics and enables or disables functions such as selecting or acti-
vating buttons.
Title Control User Operations and Playback Control User Operations are controllable
from either the HDMV mode or the BD-J mode. However, the third category, Interactive
User Operations, is only available from HDMV menus. Table 6.8 outlines the various user
operations.
One additional thing to note is that not all user operations have to be supported by all
players. Some user operations are optional functions for player implementations and may or
may not be available on a player’s remote control.

Key Events
Similar to the Interactive User Operations for HDMV menus, there are controls available
for BD-J menus. Because BD-J is using a programming language instead of a simple com-
mand set, the remote control or keyboard buttons will be tracked via Virtual Key (VK)
events. Each VK is mapped to a button on the remote control or keyboard. For BD-J menus,
event listeners must be implemented in the code to listen for the virtual keys. If the user
pushes a button on the remote control, the event listener for the VK registers the event and
an appropriate action is followed as defined in the programming. There are four groups of
Virtual Keys defined in the specification — Playback Key Events handle playback control
issues; Numeric Key Events register entries on the numeric keypad; Interactive Key Events han-
dle navigation, and there are four Color Key Events (Table 6.9). The color keys may be used
as additional buttons if needed for an application. For example, a BD-J game may need a
couple of additional buttons on the remote control to ease the navigation tasks. The color
keys are inherited from settop boxes as used for digital TV receivers, and they are always red,
green, yellow, and blue. Unfortunately, the order of the keys is not specified and, thus, varies
from country to country. Further, the color VKs are numbered from zero to three and it is
recommended to query the order of the color keys before representing them on-screen.

Video Formats
The Blu-ray specification supports three high-definition video codecs — MPEG-2,
SMPTE VC-1, and MPEG-4 AVC.  That triples the amount of supported video codecs com-
pared to DVD. Although the MPEG-2 codec is very well understood, given its legacy from
DVD, the situation is different with VC-1 and AVC. Both of these codecs are considered
more advanced and can achieve better compression ratios.  In other words, the algorithms
used by such advanced codecs are much more complex, but as a result, a better video quali-
ty can be achieved with much lower data rates.
In addition to the various video codecs, there are also a number of resolutions and frame
rates to choose from. The full high-definition resolution (also known as Full HD) of
1920×1080 pixels is supported, but Blu-ray also allows for smaller resolutions to be used,
such as, 1280×720, 720×576 (PAL), and 720×480 (NTSC). This begs the question of how
these different resolutions and, particularly, their aspect ratios, will be rendered on the var-
ious screens available (see figure 6.7 and 6.8)? For instance, how is 4:3 content rendered on
a 16:9 widescreen display, or vice versa? Ideally, the aspect ratio of the source content should
be respected, otherwise the picture will look distorted. As an example, if the source content
is 4:3 and played back on a 16:9 widescreen display, it will be stretched, making the actors
look “fat”. Since that is certainly not desired, the setting on the display should be changed to
a pillarbox presentation by adding black bars on the left and right of the picture which
remains in the original aspect ratio.

Each of the video resolutions allow for different kinds of frame rates as detailed in Table
6.10. The typical Hollywood movie is shot with a film camera, which natively produces 24
frames per second. This film frame rate is translated to 23.976 frames per second to accom-
modate NTSC television sets. Content can also be acquired through other video acquisition
methods, which results in different frame rates. For instance, some high-definition video
cameras can mimic film and record at 24 frames per second, or even 29.97 frames per sec-
ond in interlaced mode.
There are two modes in which video can be rendered to the screen — interlaced and pro-
gressive. A small letter “p” after the frame rate (e.g., 24p) indicates progressive mode, while
a small letter “i” (e.g., 29.97i) indicates interlaced mode. In interlaced mode, a frame is com-
posed of two fields, which display successively. All odd-number lines (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...) will be
rendered to the screen as the first field, and the even line numbers (e.g. ,2, 4, 6, ...) will be
rendered as the second field to compose the full frame image. This is traditionally used for
legacy television displays. However, the trend for home entertainment is to become more
and more like home theatres, so a native film resolution using progressive frames is desired.
This means that rather than splitting the frame into two fields, an entire frame is rendered
at once. Even though computer displays already use progressive display for a long time, only
recent introductions of next-generation television sets, such as, LCD or Plasma displays, or
others, allow the same frame rate film viewing experience. Figure 6.9 describes the difference
between interlaced and progressive mode.

Given the increased resolutions of high-definition content, the bitrates have to be adjust-
ed, as well. However, they certainly did not adjust scale in a linear manner. In other words,
with a high-definition resolution that is six times greater than standard definition, the maxi-
mum bitrates for video did not increase by a factor of six. Instead they only increased by a
factor of four. For DVD, the maximum video bitrate is 9.8 Mbps with a combined multi-
plexed bitrate (including all audio, video, and subtitle streams) of 10.08 Mbps. For Blu-ray,
the maximum video bitrate is 40 Mbps and the maximum multiplexed bitrate is 48 Mbps. The
reason for the larger delta between video and multiplexed bitrate is to allow enough room
for additional audio streams, especially lossless audio streams.
So now, the million-dollar question is how can the larger amount of pixels be encoded with
fewer bits while keeping the quality equal or even better? The answer is rather simple:
through advances in compression technologies. Although both VC-1 and AVC still use a
block-based motion compensation and spatial transform scheme similar to MPEG-2, there
are several enhancements in the two new codecs. Figure 6.21, presented at the end of this
chapter, shows a generalized block diagram of an MPEG-2 encoder.
VC-1 provides adaptive block-size transforms, improved motion compensation, and a sim-
ple de-blocking filter, among others tools. Figure 6.22, also presented at the end of this chap-
ter, shows a block diagram of a VC-1 encoder.
AVC provides even more advanced features and enables a lot of flexibility in the encoding
process to adapt to the complexity of the scene. As an example, the configuration of blocks
and slices, with a slice being defined as a contiguous group of multiple blocks, is flexible. So
are the multi-picture inter-picture predictions that are able to provide a higher quality image.
AVC also provides an integer-based transform algorithm to eliminate reconstruction errors
during decode, a strong de-blocking filter, and greater precision for motion compensation.
However, the biggest improvement is achieved through the Context-Adaptive Binary
Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) approach, which allows a more efficient entropy coding of the
syntax elements, and results in very big quality improvements. Figure 6.23 shows a general-
ized block diagram of an MPEG-4 AVC encoder, and is presented at the end of this chapter.
One thing to consider for both of the advanced codecs is that the increased efficiency does
not come for free. The penalty to pay is related to processing times. While an entire film
using MPEG-2 can be encoded in about the time it takes to play the film, this may not be
possible with VC-1 or AVC. The processing requirements for both advanced codecs are
much higher than for MPEG-2 resulting in much longer encoding times. One way to address
this problem is the use of so-called render farms. Many professional users take advantage of
the method of multiple computers connected via a network to share resources for encoding
tasks to significantly reduce processing times. Similarly, the advanced codecs also require
more expensive decoding circuitry in the players.
Advanced Video Applications
Besides the standard way of playing a video stream, such as a linear presentation of the
main feature, there are additional advanced video applications that allow a much richer user
experience. As with DVD, it is possible to have multiple camera angles or seamless multi-
story presentations (different contextual paths through the movie). However, the advances

do not stop there, Blu-ray also incorporates new features, such as, picture in picture (allow-
ing two parallel video streams to be presented at the same time), with or without luma key-
ing applied during playback.
Camera Angles
Blu-ray allows up to nine camera angles. This means that multiple video streams are inter-
leaved and the viewer has the opportunity to switch between the angles by using the Angle
key on the remote control. Additionally, the program code on the disc can determine and
automatically effect an angle change, as well. One thing to keep in mind for multiangle fea-
tures on a disc is the fact that all angles need to be in sync and, consequently, have the same
duration. A typical application for synchronous multiple camera angles is a concert disc,
which allow the user to switch to various camera angles, each angle following a different
member of the band. The enduser can essentially “direct” their own version of the concert
recording. Another application would be to allow multiple languages of the same scene. In
such a scenario, it is very likely that the program code makes the decision on which angle to
play based on the language selection of the user.
When multiple camera angles are used, they are multiplexed as interleave units inside the
AV stream. This is to support the buffer management of the disc, as it can automatically jump
from one interleaved unit for an angle to the next, ignoring units for other angles (Figure
6.10).
Adding a camera angle has an impact on the data rates and bit budget of the disc; having
more angles will reduce the overall running time of the disc, as well as limit the maximum
quality of the material. For example, a single-angle program of 5-minute duration encoded
at 20 Mbps would take up 750 megabytes of the disc. If the program had two angles with the
same duration, both could still be encoded at 20 Mbps. However, the program would take up
twice the amount of data on the disc — 1,500 megabytes. This obviously reduces the possi-
ble overall playback time of the disc. In addition to that, there are further limitations on the
maximum video bitrate to be used. For a single-angle program, the maximum video bitrate
is 40 Mbps while the maximum bitrate for the multiplexed stream (TS_Recording_Rate) is
48 Mbps. The limitations for multiangle are imposed on the multiplexed stream, which will
ultimately impact the maximum video bitrate. As an example, using the maximum rate for
the multiplexed stream and subtracting the data rates used by all audio streams, the author
can calculate the maximum video bitrate for each angle. Table 6.11 outlines the impact on the
maximum multiplexed data rates (TS_Recording_Rate) depending on the number of angles
being used.

Seamless Multistory
The term, seamless multistory, refers to a video presentation that allows different paths
through the disc content, hence allowing for multiple story lines. It is realized by jumping
from place to place on the disc without any break or pause in the video (see Figure 6.11).
This feature may be used for providing a viewer with alternate endings, or a director’s cut, or
similar applications.
From a conceptual point of view, the way seamless multistory is implemented in Blu-ray is
rather straightforward. Different playlists define the multiple stories and the necessary video
pieces are tied together for the desired presentation. Although two pieces of video that are
to be connected seamlessly do not have to be contiguous on the disc, the jump distance
between them is restricted. This means that any two video pieces that will be connected
seamlessly should be very close together on the disc, so that the pickup head of the drive can
jump to the next position without causing any breaks or pauses of the video. The higher the
data rate of the program stream, the smaller the jump distance needs to be, because the pick-
up head has to start reading data sooner to avoid running out of data in the buffer.
Picture in Picture
Blu-ray supports showing a secondary video image called, picture in picture (PIP). This
requires a second video decoder in the player and adds some complexity to the disc. While
the initial Blu-ray players (Profile 1.0) did not have to support picture in picture as a manda-
tory feature (which allowed for faster market introduction of players without the added com-
plexity of a secondary video decoder), all current players that are compliant with either
Profile 1.1 or Profile 2, must support PIP as a mandatory feature.

There are some restrictions on the resolutions, frame rates, and combinations of codecs
for PIP streams (Tables 6.12 and 6.13). The content author can also determine the position
of the picture in picture window and the position can change during playback. In order to do
this, each picture in picture stream has positioning and scaling metadata associated with the
secondary video file. For in-mux synchronous PIP streams, this metadata cannot be changed
on-the-fly and it has to be established during the multiplexing stage.

There are three kinds of picture in picture scenarios possible — in-mux synchronous PIP,
out-of-mux synchronous PIP, and out-of-mux asynchronous PIP.
The in-mux synchronous PIP is typically used for director’s commentary or similar appli-
cations. Both video streams are multiplexed together into a single transport stream and play
from the disc. Using this scenario, the primary and secondary videos are locked to the same
time clock when presented on the screen.
The two out-of-mux PIP options do not require the secondary video to be multiplexed
together with the primary video. And, in these scenarios, the secondary video does not have
to live on the same disc. The PIP stream could be made available as a download to a BD-
Live (Profile 2) player. A typical scenario would require the player to use a network connec-
tion to download the PIP stream to the local storage in the player. Once the download is
completed, an application on the disc would recognize the stream and use the Virtual File
System (VFS) to bind the new stream into the disc so it becomes available for the viewer
(more information on VFS is presented later in this chapter). The fact that the stream is not
on the disc will be transparent to the viewer.
With the out-of-mux synchronous approach, the application is identical to the in-mux sce-
nario where the context of the secondary video is tied to the context of the primary video.
Hence, they both have to be tied to the same clock. However, the out-of-mux scenario allows
a commentary to be made available after the disc has been finished. For instance, with
release windows for home entertainment getting shorter all the time, it may not be possible
to record a director’s commentary in time for the production of the disc. By relying on the
out-of-mux option, this commentary can be produced after the disc shipped and then made
available through a network download by the player (given that this option is authored into
the initial disc).
In the out-of-mux asynchronous case, the out-of-mux PIP stream is not tied to the prima-
ry video. Instead, user interaction can determine when the PIP stream is played. Imagine a
question and answer component on a disc: during playback of the feature, the viewer has the
option to ask various questions to the creators of the movie. The answers will be displayed as
a PIP commentary stream. Since it is up to the viewer when a question is asked, the PIP
stream cannot be synchronized to the primary video. With the asynchronous PIP, such an
application scenario is possible. However, as in the out-of-mux synchronous case, the data
cannot be played off the disc. Instead, it must be stored in the local storage area of the play-
er.
Luma Keying for Picture in Picture
An additional feature for Blu-ray is the option for luminance (luma) keys that can be
applied to PIP streams, in certain cases. The luma keying is accomplished by defining an
upper value for the luminance (Y) channel in the PIP metadata. All the pixels with a lumi-
nance value from 0 to the upper value are rendered transparent. This blends the two video
streams seamlessly together. However, the luma key can only be applied if the secondary
video is not scaled up to full screen. In the event where the secondary video is presented in
full screen, the keying cannot be applied, hence all pixels are displayed fully opaque. To avoid
such a scenario, it is recommended to prohibit the scaling of the secondary video when luma
keying is used.

Audio Formats
Considering that the number of supported video formats for Blu-ray increased compared
to DVD, the supported audio format situation is also dramatically different from DVD!
While DVD supports four audio codecs (PCM, MPEG, Dolby Digital, and DTS), Blu-ray
supports seven primary audio codecs — PCM, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby
TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD High Resolution, and DTS-HD Master Audio (Table 6.14). Why is
there a need for three Dolby formats and three DTS formats? The difference can be found
in the details. While Dolby Digital and DTS are the legacy formats from DVD, the other
audio codecs are format extensions with improved quality.
Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) is an extension of the legacy Dolby Digital format and provides
two additional channels, up to 7.1 channels. DD+ is based on the core Dolby Digital stream
and only the additional two channels are encoded using the DD+ extension while the core
5.1 streams are still encoded with the legacy Dolby Digital Substream.
The situation is similar with DTS. The DTS-HD High Resolution and the DTS-HD
Master Audio formats are extensions to the legacy DTS format. They provide up to 7.1 chan-
nels with higher bitrates, but still embodies the legacy DTS stream for backwards compati-
bility (legacy DTS only supported 5.1 channels).
Even though this may already seem a little complicated, let’s add some more confusion.

Why would we need two more audio formats — Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio?
Don’t we already have the capability for higher data rates and additional channels? The short
answer is “Yes”, but that’s not enough. The two additional audio formats are lossless formats,
whereas the Dolby Digital, DD+, DTS, and DTS High Resolution audio are lossy formats.
The difference is that lossy audio codecs are much more efficient than lossless codecs. In
other words, they eliminate a lot of redundant information in the audio source data to
achieve lower bitrates and use less disc space (see Chapter 2 for more on perceptual encod-
ing). Lossless streams provide the highest possible quality, but can require much higher
bitrates. Since lossless codecs are focused on delivering the best possible quality, they have
to allocate as many bits as needed and use a variable bitrate. This drastically changes the pro-
duction workflow compared to lossy codecs which use a constant bitrate. With a constant
bitrate, the content author is aware of how much bitrate is necessary for the audio streams
and, as a result, can easily allocate the maximum video bitrate to be used.
Having the audio stream as a variable bitrate changes this situation. The audio encoding
has to be finished before the maximum bitrate used for the lossless audio stream can be
determined. After that is done, the available maximum bitrate for the video can be calculat-
ed. Given that the video encoding historically happens before the audio encoding is finished,
the production workflow has to adapt, taking this new requirement into consideration. As
one can imagine, with the production workflow getting more complicated due to the variable
bitrate of the lossless audio codecs, the audio decoders are getting more complicated, as well.
Figures 6.24 and 6.25, presented at the end of this chapter, show block diagrams of the two
lossless audio decoders.
There is a caveat with the support of the seven primary audio formats — it is not manda-
tory for players to support the full number of channels and sampling resolutions (Table 6.14).
As some of the audio features are optional in the specification, it is up to the player manu-
facturers to decide whether or not they want to support them. The idea behind this approach
is to allow manufacturers to produce differently-featured products and to differentiate them-
selves in the marketplace. For instance, a portable player may not need to support eight
audio channels or lossless audio. By not having to support certain optional formats, the prod-
uct can be produced easier and cheaper. The content producer should be aware that in the
case where optional features are used, some players may not support them and an appropri-
ate behavior should be built into the disc.
Multichannel Configuration
With all the additional channels beyond stereo, what does that mean for the living room?
Where should the additional two speakers in a 7.1 audio configuration be positioned?
Although there is the possibility for different positioning options, a very typical scenario is
depicted in Figure 6.12. Besides the center speaker, the right and left speaker should be posi-
tioned at an angle of 30 degree, and the left surround and right surround speaker should be
positioned at an angle of 150 degrees, respectively. While this is the same configuration as a
traditional 5.1 positioning, including the position of the LFE (low frequency effects or sub-
woofer speaker), the additional two speakers would be positioned as left and right surround
side speakers, angled at 90 degree to the center speaker.

Now, if you believe that eight channels should be sufficient for a home entertainment sys-
tem, think again. Japan’s national broadcaster, NHK, has already started working on systems
of the future supporting up to 22.2 audio channels. Will that, finally, be the maximum num-
ber of audio channels? Probably not!
Secondary Audio
Besides the primary audio stream, Blu-ray also supports a secondary audio stream. This
allows discs to contain audio streams to be played in parallel and to be mixed with the pri-
mary stream. A typical application for a secondary audio stream is an audio commentary.
While watching and listening to the main feature the secondary audio commentary can be
mixed in. To allow this to happen, each Blu-ray player is required to have two audio decoders,
as well as a panner/mixer that can mix the audio channels from the secondary audio stream
with those of the primary audio stream.
The secondary audio stream can come from different sources. It can be contained on the
disc and synchronized to the movie, which would be a typical scenario for an on-disc audio
commentary. Or, it could also be made available as a download from a network source. In
such a scenario, the audio would be stored in the local storage of the player, yet could still be
synchronized to the movie. This would allow the audio commentary to be recorded later.
Note that the secondary audio does not have to be synchronized to the primary audio. An
example of an asynchronous secondary audio application might be a game where the user

can select certain buttons on the screen that drive an audio response. This response would
not be synchronized to the main feature audio as the user determines at a random point in
time when the audio is played. The asynchronous secondary audio scenario also requires the
files to come from local storage, not from the disc.
Blu-ray supports two secondary audio codecs — Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) and DTS-HD
LBR (low bitrate) (Table 6.15). As the secondary audio streams are limited to bitrates of up
to 256 kbps, both DD+ and DTS-HD are special low bitrate versions of the codecs that only
consist of an extension substream. Besides the pure audio data, secondary audio streams
must include additional mixing metadata. This allows the content producer to define the mix-
ing parameters rather than leaving it to the player to make creative decisions.
Subtitles
Blu-ray supports two types of subtitles — graphics-based and text-based. The graphics
based subtitles are called Presentation Graphics (PG) and are very similar to subpictures used
with DVD. Whereas, text-based subtitles, referred to as TextST, are a new method uniqure
to Blu-ray that can provide a more dynamic way of rendering subtitles, albeit with some
advantages and some disadvantages.
Presentation Graphics
While the graphics-based subtitles for DVD only allowed for images with four colors (two-
bit images) to be used for subtitles, Blu-ray had to add some improvements. Otherwise, the
subtitles would look awful when rendered to high definition television screens. So, the first
improvement was to increase the allowed bit-depth for the graphics to 8 bits, or 256 colors.
This allows much smoother image rendering since it is possible to use more anti-aliasing.
Looking at the Presentation Graphics (PG) decoding model, it should be mentioned that
there are three different kinds of segments described — graphics object segment, composition
segment, and palette segment. A segment defines a specific timestamp at which the element
should be decoded into the buffer. At that point in time, the graphics processor decodes the
RLE-compressed bitmap image into an uncompressed 8-bit graphic to be stored in the object
buffer. Once the image has been decoded, it can be used by one or by multiple graphics dis-
plays, as described in the composition segment. The next step has the graphics controller map-
ping the information from the composition segment and the palette segment to the image
data in the object buffer. The graphics controller is essentially responsible for compositing
the image data onto the player’s graphics plane, following the descriptions in the composi-
tion and palette segments. In other words, the controller applies the cropping, color, and
transparency information to the uncompressed image in order to render the final full-color

and full-transparency graphic on top of the video background. As mentioned earlier, each
palette segment can contain 256 entries defining color and transparency combinations to be
mapped against the 8-bit indexed source image.
As one might imagine, some basic graphics effects are possible by manipulating the color
and transparency values in the palette. In addition to that, Blu-ray supports other graphics
effects such as scrolls, wipes, cuts, and fades. Even though all of these effects may be useful
for advanced subtitle presentations, such as, karaoke streams, they could also be used for
other graphical displays over video, such as, storyboards that are timed to the video.
Bottomline, any graphical elements that can be displayed with sufficient quality using only 8-
bit graphics can take advantage of the Presentation Graphics system model.
Text-based Subtitles
Rather than using pre-rendered graphics subtitles, text-based subtitles provide a more
dynamic way for displaying subtitle data. Text and associated style information are stored and
used to render subtitles to the screen. As the text-based subtitles are implemented as out-of-
mux streams, they do not take away any bitrate capacity from the AV streams. This imple-
mentation allows text-based subtitle streams to be present on a disc without impacting the
audio or video quality. It also provides a perfect solution for downloadable subtitles as the
files are very small and they are easy to imbed as an out of-mux stream. While it is the con-
tent authors’ choice whether to use text-based or graphics-based subtitles, it should be con-
sidered that only one stream can be displayed at any given point in time. It is not possible to
display both graphics and text-based subtitles simultaneously.
Each text subtitle segment can contain up to two text regions, and each region, besides
having different text content, can be presented with a different style. However, both regions
are tied to the same timing, which is frame-accurately synchronized to the AV presentation.
The text region defines a size and position within the graphics plane and can have a unique
background color. Within the text region, a text box defines the size and position of the text
to be displayed. This framework provides flexibility for a user to define how much border will
be shown outside the text. Each text box also has attributes that can be defined, such as, text
flow, alignment, and line spacing. And, obviously, the various attributes such as font type,
style, size and color can be set for each region, as well. In addition to defining the text attrib-
utes for a given text box, they can also be set individually for each character as in-line styles.
So having listed all the flexibility and bandwidth advantages of text-based subtitles, what
are the trade-offs? Well, there are two disadvantages. First, it should be recognized that each
player has a different font renderer and although the content author is able to define the
fonts, they may look different on each player. But, besides this artistic challenge, there is a
more fundamental issue called font licensing. Which font will be used should be considered
very carefully. Although some fonts are available for free, most of them are not. And, in
order to include them on a Blu-ray Disc, each font needs to be licensed, which adds some
administrative and financial obstacles, especially when considering international releases.
One way around font licenses is to design a unique font. Although this may seem a little bit
over the top, it is actually not too difficult to implement, could add something unique to the
disc and certainly avoids getting surprised by font royalty payments.

Parental Management
One of the requirements from the Hollywood studios is to have a mechanism in place to
control the levels of parental control for their movies. The idea is to allow a user to set a cer-
tain parental level on a player and prevent the playback of movies above that level. For exam-
ple, when there are under-aged children at home, the Blu-ray player can be set to only allow
playing movies appropriate to their age, unless the parent enters a specific password to
unlock the playback of more mature content when the parents are watching themselves.
With Blu-ray, PSR 13 (Player Status Register 13) provides this kind of parental manage-
ment. The user defines the parental level for a given player in the player settings menu, which
sets the corresponding value in the register. Whenever content is played back, commands on
the disc can check for the value of this PSR. In case the value is too low to allow playback, a
warning card with an explanatory message can be displayed on-screen. In case the value is
high enough to permit playback, the disc presentation would continue without problem.
PSR13 can contain an integer value from ‘0’ to ‘255’ and represents the youngest age for
which the content is permitted. The value ‘0’ is the most restricted content and value ‘255’
signals that the parental control is switched off. As an example, Table 6.16 outlines how this
PSR could be mapped against the MPAA rating system used in North America.
Because different countries have different rating systems, it is common that a parental
management system is also bound to the country code setting inside the player. This setting
is also done within the settings menu of the player and defines which country the player is
used in, which is stored in PSR19. In order to support parental levels for multiple countries,
the value of PSR19 should be checked or determined before checking for PSR13. By com-
bining both results, the rating system for the respective country can be applied. Note that, as
with DVD, this parental control system is, of course, predicated on the film content owners
assigning practical ratings to their movies and for that information to be stored on the discs
and properly read by the players.
Metadata
Metadata is defined as data describing data and, in the context of Blu-ray, metadata is
used to describe the data on the disc. This can be very useful for certain applications, such as
disc search. For example, if each disc included a metadata description that could be stored

inside a player, a user could very easily start searching for titles with their favorite actor,
director, or genre. To allow such a disc library search, the Blu-ray implementation of the
application metadata is split into two parts — a metadata description file and associated
thumbnails.
The metadata description file contains information about the name of the disc and, on a
more granular level, the content of each title, each chapter, and track name, the various lan-
guages, and so on. All, or some, of this information can be provided by the content author
and becomes available for a disc search. The way this is implemented is that once a disc is
inserted into a player, the metadata file is copied to the local storage of the player. As discs
get inserted into the player, a disc library starts building up. However, how much of a disc
search is possible within a given player depends on the specific player implementation.
Thumbnails are an additional feature that provides a visual link to the content. They are
similar to the jacket pictures in DVD. For instance, while the metadata of a specific disc is
displayed on the screen, it could also show an associated thumbnail, such as, the disc cover.
In addition to a thumbnail for the disc, the metadata descriptors can contain thumbnails for
each title. Basically, all the thumbnails are stored as separate files with references inside the
metadata information file. In this way, it is easy for content authors to decide whether to use
thumbnails for a disc or title search. It is also possible to store multiple resolutions of thumb-
nails to accommodate different display resolutions.
HDMV Details
The HD Movie (HDMV) disc authoring model can be thought of as the more basic level
of menu programming. It can be compared to standard DVD authoring, while providing a
number of new functionalities and advanced concepts that can enrich the user experience.
The terminology for HDMV is also very different from DVD. However, in terms of the
authoring process, HDMV and DVD are, indeed, very similar in the sense that each requires
a dedicated piece of software to format the disc. And, it is up to that software to determine
whether it provides a low level access to all functions and parameters or whether it abstracts
them to a higher level for easier authoring.
Popup Menus
One of the new concepts introduced on Blu-ray discs is popup menus, which is one appli-
cation of the Interactive Graphics (IG) framework. Actually, this is not really new as settop
boxes for TV’s have been using this feature for quite a while but, compared to having to nav-
igate to full-screen menus on DVD, popup menus can provide a much less disruptive user
experience. Rather than leaving the feature presentation to jump to a full-screen menu page
in order to select a different audio stream, this can now be done while the feature keeps play-
ing, using menus that only cover a portion of the video presentation.
However, the good ol’ full-screen menus in a dedicated area (referred to as menu space)
are not completely lost. Blu-ray differentiates between a Top menu and a popup menu. The
Top menu remains a designated area on the disc, similar to DVD, where full-screen menus

can be placed and are separate from the video titles. This differentiation also means that,
depending on the player implementation, there will most likely be two different menu but-
tons on a remote control — “Title Menu” and “Popup Menu”.
As the name suggests, the popup menu appears whenever the user pushes the appropriate
button on the remote control. At that point in time, the video keeps playing while a menu
selection is displayed over the video and the user can navigate through various menu pages
to select different audio or subtitle streams, browse different chapters or other available con-
tent on the disc. Once the user is done, by pushing the same remote control button again or
through a simple timer, the popup menu disappears.
Multipage Menus
Menus may be composed of multiple pages, with a page being defined as a composite
interactive display. As there can only be one page displayed at a time, all menu elements
need to be contained therein. This includes all buttons with the various states — normal,
selected, activated — and all other displayed graphics. As Figure 6.13 depicts, the first page
may show the main menu in its starting layout with all submenus collapsed. Page 2 would
show the main menu including the submenu items for the audio settings, page 3 would show
the submenu items for the scene selection, and so on. This approach is flexible and scalable,
but requires the necessary programming logic to make sure that the appropriate page is
shown at any given time.
In addition to displaying multiple static pages, HDMV menus also offer the ability for
effects and animations. Each page can have an in- and out-effect associated with it that plays
prior to loading the page or right before transitioning the page into the inactive state. A com-
mon application of this would be to animate the main menu bar onto the screen when the
menus are turned on and to animate them off the screen when the menus are turned off.
Similar to presentation graphics (subtitles), the effects supported are scrolls, wipes, cuts,
fades, and color changes.

While the page effects certainly provide a nice visual aid for the menu presentation, ani-
mations are also possible for buttons. A sequence of images can be displayed for each but-
ton state (normal, selected, activated). Imagine having static images for each button in the
normal state, and then the selected button would spin or run some other animation to signal
the selected state to the viewer. There would not be any doubt about which button is cur-
rently selected.
HDMV Graphics Limitations
All of the new fancy menu effects are interesting, but there are limitations. There is a limit
of 16MB for all graphical elements used in the total of the menu pages of the HDMV menu
set. While this sounds plentiful, it really is not when you look into the details. For instance,
in order to render menu animations, a separate page has to be created for every frame dis-
played. Where a main menu bar is animated in ten frames onto the screen, ten menu pages
would need to be rendered. And, although the pages would all be using the same source
graphics, the amount of memory taken up would be a multiple of that, as each of the source
elements needs to be decoded separately into the graphics buffer for each menu page. This
restriction makes it very challenging to use animations within the HDMV menu framework.  
On a more fundamental level, as Interactive Graphics follow the same principles as
Presentation Graphics, they are limited to 256 color/transparency combinations. While each
menu page can have its own color palette associated with it, in practice this is not very com-
mon due to the fact that menu source elements will likely be shared between various menu
pages, and differing color palettes may result in color shifts when switching pages. When
using HDMV graphics may not result in a satisfying viewing experience, there is always the
option to go with BD-J menus, as described later in this chapter.
Interactive Audio
In addition to providing for button animations, Blu-ray Disc accommodates an option for
button sounds or interactive audio. Whenever a user interaction occurs, an audio snippet can
be played, as well. Interactive audio can be associated with each selected and each activated
button state. When a button is selected, a sound effect is heard and, when the button is acti-
vated, a different sound effect is heard. This can be used in many creative ways: just envision
using this feature to create a version of menus for the visually impaired. And in the context
of button sounds for popup menus, the audio will be mixed with any other currently playing
audio streams.
The format for interactive audio is LPCM, which may contain up to two channels with a
sampling frequency of 48kHz and 16 bits per sample. All button sounds are stored in a
sound.bdmv file, which can contain up to 128 individual pieces but cannot exceed a total
aggregated file size of 2MB.
Interactive audio can also be used by BD-J applications. In fact, the support of interactive
audio in HDMV mode is optional for players but it is mandatory for BD-J applications.
Fortunately, most players do support interactive audio for either scenario.

Browsable Slideshow
Another feature introduced with Blu-ray is the browsable slideshow. This feature basical-
ly decouples a contiguous audio presentation from the images being viewed. As a result, it is
possible to present a number of still images or video clips while audio continues to play. The
user is able to switch back and forth between the slides without interrupting the audio. With
DVD, such an application feature was desired, but was only possible with DVD-Audio play-
ers. Now, using the path and subpath concept of Blu-ray, this scenario is available. The
images are stored in the main path for the user to navigate while the audio is stored in a sub-
path. The user navigation within the main path will not interfere with the audio play back
from the subpath.
BD-Java (BD-J) Details
The most sophisticated method of programming a Blu-ray Disc takes advantage of the
Java programming language, and is called BD-Java (BD-J). This allows a lot of flexibility for
the content author at the core of the system, as there are no restrictions introduced by spe-
cific authoring software2. This is pure software development and can be best compared to
writing a software application for a PC. This, obviously, requires a much higher level of com-
mitment and a very different skill set than what regular DVD authors would normally bring
to the table.
The benefit of a full-fledged programming language is the level of flexibility it provides to
programmers. Other than your own imagination and the capabilities of the playback hard-
ware, there are no further constraints. A second benefit is the reusability of the software
code. Java code can be developed in an abstract way where the code portions are separated
from the creative or content portions. This way it is easy to reuse the same code for multiple
discs, as only the specific content (graphics, animations, text, et cetera) would have to
change. Another benefit is extensibility and scalability. As the code interacts with the appli-
cation and the player, it is possible to scale an application based on the player’s capabilities.
This means that a more powerful player may show more advanced menu animations while
other players may not. BD-J guarantees a great user experience on every player without hav-
ing to code only for the lowest common denominator. And, because players will most likely
get better and faster as time goes on, writing extensible code allows for new features to be
introduced further down the line. In other words, there may be ideas that cannot be imple-
mented in today’s applications due to player limitations, such as slow processors or minimal
loca storage capacity. However, this situation may change over time as player processors get
faster and hare larger internal and external hard drives, at which point such application fea-
tures would become possible.
2There are software applications available with the aim of simplifying the BD-J development process by auto-
matically generating BD-J code. Such applications typically provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI), which
means it doesn’t require a Java programmer to build a BD-J application. On the flip side of that, most of these
applications have their own set of limitations and it may not always be possible to implement the features and
functions desired.

System Overview
BD-J applications interact with the user to control the player. The system model, depict-
ed in Figure 6.14, shows four components that communicate with each other. On the lowest
level, the Resources represent the capabilities of the player, such as decoding, memory man-
agement, and the player control. The BD-J module includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
on which the applications run and the Application Manager, which determines what applica-
tion runs.  The BD-J module also translates the Application Programming Interface (API)
calls to access the necessary resources. The BD-J API component is a collection of functions
and objects to communicate with the player. The BD-J applications use the API to load files,
access the network, control the disc playback, any any other function that requires the play-
er to perform a task. The top level of the system model is the BD-J application, which uses a
so-called Xlet, a term inherited from JavaTV™. It is very similar to an applet, which is a light-
weight application commonly used for web applications. In this context, Xlets follow the
same lifecycle definitions with multiple states — loaded, paused, activated, and destroyed.
Resources and BD-J Module
There are a number of different resources that can be accessed by the BD-J application,
such as graphics, sounds, JARs (Java Archives), and the AV structure on or off the disc. In
order to access and manage these resources, the BD-J module is used. The BD-J module
provides an abstraction layer between the player and the disc application. It uses the appli-
BD-J applications

cation cache, which is best described as a pre-load buffer for the application. All files (JARs,
and other files or directories) necessary to properly run the application will be loaded into
this cache. Once they are loaded into the cache, the application manager can take control.
The manager can load or unload individual applications and manage their lifecycles, accord-
ingly. Besides the application cache, there are other memory buffers holding additional
resources that can be accessed by the BD-J module. Table 6.17 outlines the various buffers
and their respective sizes, which vary between the different player profiles.
Now, a question may come to mind of why the different buffers are necessary. In a real-
life scenario, the JAR files may contain a lot of class files (Java code) and a bunch of com-
pressed images (PNG, JPEG, et cetera.). These JAR files will then be loaded into the appli-
cation cache. However, in order for the application module to use the images inside the
JARs, they have to be decompressed. This would happen next and, as a result, all uncom-
pressed images will be available in the image memory. Then the application can be executed
and displayed on the screen.
It is very similar with the font buffer. In order for an application to use a font, it has to be
copied into a buffer to be accessible. Because some fonts, particularly Asian fonts with many
complex characters, may take up a lot of space, it may not be possible to render the font in a
timely manner. By using the buffer, however, fast interaction is possible. In other words,
fonts can be generated on-the-fly as the characters are pre-loaded in the buffer.
BD-J Application Programming Interface (API)
A programmer interacts with the player by using Application Programming Interfaces
(API). There are API functions for pretty much anything you can imagine — mathematical
operations, file I/O, playback control, graphics display and animations, text rendering, net-
work access, local storage management, and so on. However, the API set for BD-J pro-
grammng is a bit more complicated and requires some background on how the BD-J speci-
fication came about.
It is very common for a format specification to reference other specifications. For instance,
the DVD specification references various audio and video specifications such as MPEG,
Dolby, DTS, and others. However, from a programming perspective, DVD has always been
very self-contained in the sense that everything you needed to know was defined in one doc-

ument — the DVD Specification. While it is generally the same for HDMV, it is a little dif-
ferent for BD-J. The BD-J specification leverages a multitude of other specifications as
depicted in Figure 6.15.
For starters, BD-J uses the Personal Basis Profile (PBP) of Java, which was developed after
PersonalJava™(pJava), which was started in 1997, as a more lightweight programming envi-
ronment for applications running on interactive TV devices or something similar. Although
the PBP specification is a great start, it does not address broadcast specific functions, such
as, scaling and positioning video, switching audio, video, or subtitle channels, and so on. The
good thing is that other standards subsequently started developing on top of pJava and, later,
PBP to address such items. For instance, the JavaTV specifications, which include the Java
Media Framework (JMF), were developed to introduce media APIs for streaming applica-
tions on personal computers. Later on, when this was not enough, the GEM (Globally
Executable MHP) specifications introduced more functionality by leveraging even more spec-
ifications such as MHP (Multimedia Home Platform), which references HAVi (Home Audio
Video Interoperability) and DAVIC (Digital Audio Video Council). And since BD-J also
requires some custom APIs that were not required for anything other than Blu-ray, the BD-
J specifications contain additional APIs .
With that background in mind, it can be a little exhausting to find the necessary API for a
specific function. Table 6.20 attempts to provide an overview of the various packages con-
tained in each set of specifications — PBP, JavaTV, GEM, MHP, and BD-J specifications.
The table is by no means an exhaustive list but, hopefully, it helps as a starting point. Please
keep in mind that an MHP broadcaster becomes a BD content provider, a terminal or receiv-
er becomes a BD player, and a service becomes a title.

As one may imagine, with multiple specifications referencing each other, some function-
alities can be implemented in multiple ways using different APIs. This creates some com-
plexity for player implementation. As an example, a player manufacturer needs to support
multiple ways of loading images, making the testing procedures more complex. As a result,
it is recommended to properly test every disc in as many players as possible to ensure that
the APIs used are properly implemented in the player and do not cause any compatibility or
performance problems.
BD-J Menus
With BD-J positioned as the advanced programming method for Blu-ray, it can, of course,
at minimum mimic the menu functionality of HDMV. Full-screen and popup menus, as
described in the HDMV part of this chapter, can also be achieved using BD-J. However, the
way these menus are implemented in BD-J differs very much, and provides additional capa-
bilities. First of all, the way that graphics are used is very different. BD-J menus do not fol-
low the page model that HDMV uses. Instead, BD-J provides a minimum graphics buffer of
45.5MB for Profile 1 or 61.5MB for Profile 2 players, as noted in Table 6.17. All graphical
elements to be used by the BD-J menus are decoded into the image and audio buffer3. This
means that a decoded image can be used multiple times without taking up additional space.
This model benefits more advanced animations. Graphical elements can be moved across the
screen as much as the author would like them to, and the animations can even be dynami-
cally created by the Java code, without impacting the graphics buffer.

Blu-ray Disc Demystified
Blu-ray supports three image formats — JPEG, PNG, and GIF. The JPEG format is com-
monly used for a variety of Internet applications as the files are small in size. However, the
disadvantage of the JPEG format is that it does not support transparencies. When multiple
graphical objects are overlapping and must be composited together before being displayed,
transparency information is necessary. For such a case, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
format is typically used as it supports alpha blending. The third graphics format supported by
Blu-ray is GIF but, in reality it is not used very often as it only supports one transparency
color. As a result, JPEG and PNG are most commonly used in real-life Blu-ray applications,
with the former best used for background and opaque images with no mattes, and the latter
used for matted or transparent graphics.
Graphics Drawing
For compositing images, there are different graphics drawing methods available for BD-J.
Depending on the application scenario, an image can be drawn to the screen in different
ways. First, there is source mode (SRC), which takes an image the way it is and renders it to
the screen, which is also called direct draw. This mode does not take other graphical images
into account which may be overlapped. Instead, source mode simply renders the image that
is on top without blending any overlapped graphical areas. If the image is semi-transparent
it will render as such and allow the background video plane to be seen through the image.
But, other rendered graphic elements on the graphics plane will not be blended. Figure 6.16
is an example of source mode, where the rectangle cannot be seen through the ellipse.
Figure 6.16  Graphics Drawing in Source Mode
(Courtesy of the United States Capitol Historical Society and HeritageSeries, LLC)

The second graphics-drawing mode is called source-over mode (SRC_OVER). This mode
takes transparency values into account when compositing overlapped graphical areas. This
method is typically used for graphics animations, and takes multiple overlaid images and
blends them together. Where graphics are semi-transparent, this mode shows the back-
ground video through the transparent areas of the rendered images. Figure 6.17 is an exam-
ple of the source-over (SRC_OVER) drawing mode, where both the rectangle and the back-
ground video can be seen through the ellipse.
The reason for having both modes is to allow for different creative scenarios. However,
there is a slight performance hit when using the source-over mode. Since the images have to
be composited together, additional processing power is required inside the player. As a
result, the source-over drawing speed is slower than using source mode and this should be
considered during any application development.
Graphics Animations
The third graphics drawing mode for BD-J is called frame-accurate animation (FAA). It
comes in two variants — image frame-accurate animation and synchronized frame accurate
animation (SFAA). The idea of this drawing mode is to have a tighter connection of the
graphics animation to the video presentation in the background. The FAA graphics are
locked frame-by-frame to the video playback, which means that graphics will only appear at

the timecode desired. This feature provides a great potential for creative applications.
However, it, too, does not come for free.
Looking at all three drawing methods — SRC, SRC_OVER, and FAA, the player perfor-
mance numbers vary. The fastest drawing method is the SRC mode as it draws the image
directly to the screen without applying any alpha blending. The recommended minimum per-
formance for the SRC drawing mode is 15 megapixels per second. Since the SRC_OVER and
FAA modes require additional processing for operations, such as applying alpha blending or
timing, the minimum performance is lower at 10 megapixels per second. Such implications
should be kept in mind while designing applications to ensure that the animations will per-
form as expected on all players.
BD-J Text
One of the main benefits for using BD-J menus is they allow a lot of flexibility. An area
where this becomes particularly apparent is for displaying dynamically-generated text. This
provides a huge contrast to DVD or to HDMV menus where all the text has to be pre-com-
posed and cannot be dynamically created during playback. For example, for a DVD game, an
individual graphic for every possible score has to be created and stored on the disc. This lim-
itation is history when using BD-J where the scores can be dynamically generated by the Java
code and displayed on the screen. Additionally, for example, it is possible for users to enter
their name to personalize the game or to allow multi-player scenarios.
There are two ways that BD-J text can be implemented on a Blu-ray Disc. One approach
is to use fonts in a manner similar to text subtitles. The BD-J application loads an OTF font
and then can render any text string to the screen. Of course, this has the same drawbacks as
the text subtitles, which means each player uses a slightly different font renderer, making the
final result potentially look different on each player. However, to display certain information,
such as, game scores, user names, or runtimes of videos, this is a great method to use.
A second, but a little bit more complicated, way is to implement bitmap fonts. Basically,
there is one large image file (often called a character strip) containing all the letters and num-
bers in the alphabet with an associated coordinates list that describes the cropping parame-
ters for each letter. However, it should be noted that bitmap fonts are not natively support-
ed by BD-J but, instead, must be implemented in the application. But, by using this method,
any text string can be assembled on the screen using the bitmap font. This allows the creative
designers to define how the font will look and does not leave it up to the player for interpre-
tation. The amount of additional graphics memory necessary to accommodate this may be
negligible. Although this method works great for western languages, applying it to Asian lan-
guages is much more difficult considering the larger amount of characters available.
However, both options should be considered to provide a more dynamic user experience.
Advanced BD-J Features
Being able to create interactive, dynamic, and animated menus is a great benefit of using
BD-J, but there are additional features that are much more advanced and provide a lot of
creative potential that is waiting to be unleashed. Some of these features are not possible

with the Profile 1.0 players that were first released to the market. Other features are only
possible with Profile 2, which is optional for players. However, it is worth noting these fea-
tures, as they are truly innovative and very interesting in certain applications.
Multi-disc Sets
Before getting too far into the territory of the newer generation players that are using
Profile 1.1 or 2, let’s focus on advanced features that are possible with any player. One of
those features is a multi-disc set. Imagine a Blu-ray boxed set with multiple discs holding all
episodes to a TV series. Wouldn’t it be great if the entire boxed set could be enjoyed without
interrupting the user experience? In other words, once all the episodes on the first disc are
finished, the menu would ask for the next disc to be inserted and, while the disc change hap-
pens, the menus remain on-screen with some animations continuing to run. Once the new
disc is ready, playback automatically resumes with the next episode without having to press
a single button. All this is possible with BD-J by using disc-unbound applications.
A BD-J application can be bound to either a title or a disc allowing the following three
scenarios —
j First, the application can be disc and title bound, which means that the applica-
tion is only active while a specific title is being played. In the event where the
title is changed, for instance to jump to a bonus piece, the application is termi-
nated.
j The second scenario is disc bound and title unbound, which allows the applica-
tion to continue running while a title change occurs. This allows a more inte-
grated disc experience, as the main menu may always be present regardless of
the title being played back.
j However, in the first two scenarios, the application is terminated whenever the
disc is ejected. This is where scenario three comes into play, the disc-unbound
application. This scenario allows a disc to be ejected and another disc to be
inserted without terminating the application. During the disc change, the appli-
cation continues to run, provided that both discs have the proper permissions
set. This multi-disc feature provides excellent creative opportunities to improve
the user experience.
Programmable Audio Mixing
As one may expect, BD-J also provides capabilities for interactive audio just like HDMV
does. Yet, since BD-J is a programming language it allows a lot more flexibility. Basically, a
Blu-ray Disc can play multiple different audio streams simultaneously, such as, main audio
for the primary feature track, secondary audio for a commentary or PIP track, and effect
audio for button sounds or other effects. Because the player only allows one audio stream to
be output, this requires the player to mix the streams together. An audio mixer inside the
player performs the mixing function, as depicted in Figure 6.18.

Application Details
6
6 - 4 5
Blu-ray Disc Demystified
The audio mixer accepts mixing parameters that determine how the final output will
sound. And since it is important for an application to control these parameters, BD-J allows
a content developer to have full control over the audio mixing happening inside the player.
It is even possible to programmatically change the audio mixing parameters to make it even
more flexible or to potentially pass the control to the enduser via an on-screen tool.
Local Storage
The local storage feature of Blu-ray allows a player to have onboard memory to store addi-
tional data for various purposes. Each Blu-ray player has two different local storage areas —
an Application Data Area (ADA, sometimes also referred to as APDA, and known in MHP
as persistent storage) and a Binding Unit Data Area (BUDA).
The Application Data Area resides inside the player and is guaranteed to only be 64KB in
size. This area is typically used to store small amounts of information such as user prefer-
ences, progress information, or other small data files. The Binding Unit Data Area can either
reside inside or outside the player, or both. The intention for BUDA is to be able to store
larger files — AV streams, subtitles, applications, or other types of files. Even if a player
already has a large amount of built-in local storage, it may have the option for additional
storage that can be added externally, for instance, through the use of a USB port.
While the ADA support has been available inside players from the very beginning (start-
ing with the Profile 1.0 players), support of BUDA was only introduced with Profile 1.1 play-
ers. The minimum requirement for a Profile 1.1 player level is to support 256MB of BUDA
storage, while a Profile 2 player has to support a minimum of 1GB. The reasoning for this
should be rather obvious. If a player is network-connected, it is more likely that additional
storage space for downloaded material will be required.
However, the BD requirements state that as long as a player provides the capability to add
external storage, the minimum requirement is fulfilled. In other words, as long as a player

comes with a USB port to add external storage, it does not need to ship with the required
256MB or 1GB itself. And, in reality, a lot of players indeed follow this direction and are only
shipping with a USB port and the 64KB of ADA storage, leaving it up to the consumer to
add the additional storage.
Virtual File System
Once content is available in the Binding Unit Data Area of local storage, either through
network downloads or via a copy from a physical disc, a disc application can take advantage
of it. This is accomplished by the creation of a Virtual File System (VFS). The VFS binds the
files in local storage securely to the file system on the disc and creates a new “virtual pack-
age”. None of the files on the disc are actually replaced but instead the pointers to the files
are changed to the ones in local storage. Additionally, new files can be added to the file sys-
tem to extend the capabilities of the user. For instance, a disc can be sold with three trailers
during the intro and five audio languages for the main feature. Using the VFS, at a later
point in time the initial three trailers can be replaced by newer trailers and the number of
audio streams can be increased.
To do all this, a manifest file is needed that describes which files will be used from local
storage and which files are to be used from the disc in order to create the ultimate user expe-
rience. Then, a new file system is created that maps all of the streams and makes viewing the
disc a seamless experience. The viewer will not be able to tell whether the content is playing
off the disc or from local storage.
Figure 6.26, presented at the end of this chapter, depicts how such a virtual package might
be mapped.
BD-Live Functionality
Profile 2 players are assumed to either have a WiFi or an Ethernet connection that allows
them to connect to a network or to the Internet. If a player provides this capability, a BD-J
application can talk to the network using sockets, HTTP, and HTTPS connections. In the
event where a secure connection is necessary (for example, to enable e-commerce applica-
tions), the Secure Socket Layer (SSL), formally known as the Transport Security Layer (TSL),
can be used. In such a case, the BD-J application would open an HTTPS connection and use
the specific SSL APIs provided by BD-J. This allows the same protection that is common to
other kinds of web applications.
Uploading and Downloading Content
Before a BD-Live application gets into action, it should be considered that just because a
player has the capability to connect to the Internet, does not mean that the player is actual-
ly hooked up. One of the first steps for any BD-Live application should be to check whether
or not a network connection is indeed available. Once this is confirmed, any of the above
mentioned connection types — sockets, HTTP, or HTTPS — can be used to transfer data
either from a server to the player, or from the player to a server.

Typical download applications include pulling new AV streams from the Internet, such as
the most recent trailers, additional audio or subtitle streams, bonus videos, or new BD-J
applications. Network connectivity provides the perfect mechanism to update BD-J applica-
tions of a disc to either enable more functions or to fix bugs that were encountered after the
disc was released. In fact, a great way to start implementing BD-Live on discs is by adding a
so-called bootstrap functionality. This means that a disc, after insertion into the player, will
automatically try to connect to a network server to check for available updates. If an update
is available, the user can decide if it should be downloaded or not. This bootstrap function-
ality allows additional features or fixes to be added without having to plan for them in the
beginning. It’s basically getting a foot in the door to add more functionality of any kind in the
future. And if it is not necessary to add anything in the future, then it doesn’t have to hap-
pen.
The counterpart of downloading features is uploading features. Typical scenarios for this
are to allow users to upload information and share it with others on the network. This could
be high-scores for games, bookmarks to their favorite scenes, or other types of user-specific
comments for a given title. The possibilities provided by uploading or downloading func-
tionalities are great, and combining them both makes it an even stronger proposition. A disc
could include chat functionalities, as known from other computer environments, that allow
users to talk about their favorite movie with other enthusiasts. Or, network games are also
possible, where multiple online players can compete against each other. These kinds of sce-
narios all require data to be transferred both ways and need an application to be flexible
enough to render instant information dynamically to the screen. In order to do this, though,
the use of fonts or bitmap fonts is necessary.
Progressive PlayList
A great feature introduced by BD-Live is called Progressive PlayList. The intent is to allow
AV streams delivered from the network to start playing before the entire stream is down-
loaded. A user does not have to wait until the entire stream is downloaded before it can be
watched. The playback can begin as soon as a minimum amount of data is transferred into a
local buffer, while the rest of the stream continues to download in the background. This kind
of functionality is very common to Internet downloads that provide pseudo-streaming expe-
riences using progressive downloads.
In Blu-ray, this is implemented by using a virtual asset (a Progressive PlayList) that is sim-
ilar in structure to a regular PlayList in the sense that it contains multiple PlayItems and ref-
erences AV stream data. However, it differs in the way that it allows playback to start before
all assets are available. Because a PlayList is divided into multiple PlayItems, the playback
can start once the first PlayItem is successfully downloaded. While the playback starts, the
remaining Playitems continue downloading in the background. As additional PlayItems
become available, they are enabled for playback. It only depends on the download speed to
determine whether or not the playback will be seamless. If the download speed is too slow,
the playback will pause at the end of a PlayItem until the next item is available, at which point
the playback continues.

Application Signing
If a BD-J application is attempting to perform an operation that is beyond a self-contained
“sandbox”, meaning it needs to interact with other parts of the disc or with other applications
— jumping to titles, starting and stopping other applications, reading and writing to local
storage, using the virtual file system, or accessing the network — an authentication process
is necessary. This authentication process is called application signing and the permissions of
every application are defined in the Permission Request File (PRF). The PRF contains infor-
mation about which area of the local storage can be accessed, or which network ports the
player may connect to. The application signing is not a content protection mechanism but
instead provides an authentication procedure to ensure that the content on the disc has not
been altered and is indeed allowed to access other content located in local storage or on a
network server.
The way this works is that each application is signed and a PRF, as well as the corre-
sponding certificate, is attached to it. The certificate is authenticated against a disc root cer-
tificate through a certificate chain. The disc root certificate is authenticated through AACS.
This allows scenarios where different parties may create individual parts of the disc. In this
case, each party signs their own application and creates their own PRF, and the authoring
studio putting it all together incorporates all of the applications with the signatures and PRFs
to create the disc with their own root certificate.
As the next step, a SHA-1 hash4 of the root certificate is generated that is incorporated
into the master AACS List as part of the encryption process. As a result, whenever a disc is
inserted into a player, the hash of the root certificate contained on the disc is calculated by
the player and compared against the hash in the AACS list. If the content has not been mod-
ified, the hash values will match and the application will load. Figure 6.19 outlines the work-
flow scenario for application signing including multiple application developers and the use of
content from different locations — disc, local storage, and the network.
The root certificate is also an important piece when it comes to managing the local storage
in a player. As one could imagine, having a lot of discs accessing the same storage area can
make it difficult to manage that space and will most likely come to naming conflicts if the
space is not managed properly. As such, Blu-ray implemented a directory structure that
allows sharing the common storage space. The idea is to have multiple layers of directories
that differentiate between studios (content owners), producers (authoring facilities), and
discs.
The root certificate is used to differentiate between studios. Each studio should have their
own root certificate that it carefully manages, and each studio should issue leaf certificates
to every authoring vendor they are using. Hence, every disc created by Studio A will be based
on the same root certificate, regardless of the authoring studio. As a second security step, the
4SHA is shorthand for “Secure Hash Algorithm”. A SHA-1 hash is a cryptographic signature for a text or a data
file. It is sometimes called a “digest”. A hash is not encryption, as it cannot be decrypted back to the original
file content. It is a one-way cryptographic function. It is a process that may be used to validate passwords,
authenticate “handshakes”, verify digital signatures of files, et cetera.

Organization ID is used to differentiate between different authoring vendors, or producers.
Alternatively, the Organization ID could also be used as a differentiator between different
product categories of a given studio. For example, children’s discs could use a different
Organization ID than mature content discs. The third security level is the Disc ID, which dif-
ferentiates between different discs by a given studio and authoring facility.
This kind of structure helps to manage the content of discs and keeps them organized. It
should be mentioned that a disc is only allowed to access the content of its own tree. In other
words, a disc can access the data stored in its own Disc ID directory, its Organization ID
directory, and the root certificate directory. This allows for sharing assets across multiple
discs of the same category. As an example, if multiple children’s discs of a given studio should
share the latest trailers, it probably makes sense to store them in the area of the Organization
ID, where each disc underneath can access them. On the other hand, if the trailers were
stored in the disc-specific area of the local storage, another disc would not be able to access
the data, unless specific credentials allowed for it.

Credential Process
When one disc needs to access data stored in the disc-specific area of another disc, the cre-
dential process is a method implemented in BD-J to allows for that. Credentials grant per-
mission to applications to read or write data in other areas of the local storage. The way this
works is illustrated in Figure 6.20.
Basically, one producer (Producer A) grants permission to another producer (Producer B)
to access Producer A’s application. Thus, Producer B can access the disc-specific area of the
application from Producer A to share data. In order to do so, a certain information exchange
is necessary. First, Producer B (grantee) has to provide the Organization ID, Application ID,
and root certificate of Application B to Producer A (grantor). Then, Producer A will create
a credential and provide it to Producer B along with its own signature that was used for the
initial Application A. As the last step, the credential is implemented in Application B’s per-
mission request file (PRF), and Producer B can then access Application A’s data in the local
storage area.
This all may seem a little bit confusing, but the process provides a lot of flexibility in man-
aging BD-J applications and data stored in local storage areas. However, to keep it all orga-
nized, it is recommended to properly plan a disc beforehand to make sure that the data
stored in local storage is available to all discs that need to access it. And, bearing the com-
plexity of the process in mind, it is also recommended to thoroughly test the workflows
before implementing it on discs. In that way, a desired functionality and user experience can
be guaranteed.

Player technology has advanced to a level where the device components may match or
exceed the components found in a typical desktop computer. Further, it ostensibly “won” the
high-definition format war, Blu-ray faces competition from an unlikely source — DVD play-
ers that can upconvert the video output to high-definition displays. Added to the challenge
of choosing a player, there is the confusing complexity confronted when trying to make a
decision about those very high-definition displays.
Early adopters of HD displays are now caught in the technological gulch of having a great-
looking display but the display is simply not equipped to present the best possible image from
a Blu-ray Disc player. The early model widescreen televisions may not have the latest in con-
nection security with HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) capability. If a Blu-ray
Disc is authored to require that a secure HDMI connection exist between the player and the
display, the player will only allow a less than full-resolution image to be passed to the display
when there is no HDMI security. And, lurking in the wings is the soon-to-emerge (slow-to-
emerge?) DisplayPort™connection technology that replaces DVI and VGA connections for
PCs while respecting HDMI connections to HDTVs (whew!). Those videophiles who bought
into the high definition arena before HDMI are just plain out of luck (unless they take their
chance with a reverse adapter, HDMI to RGB).
Conversely, early Blu-ray adopters most likely do not have a player that is capable of being
upgraded to take advantage of the latest Blu-ray Profile features. When Blu-ray players were
introduced they were only required to meet the initial feature set specified for a Profile 1
player. Further, the early players may not be capable of accepting a feature upgrade as their
components are simply too simple (see Chapter 8, Myths).
Yet, it is not only the endusers who are flummoxed by the myriad player choices. Disc
authors are caught in a never-neverland of what player is capable of what features and
whether they should program for what the player is supposed to be able to execute accord-
ing to the latest format specifications or should they program for the lowest common denom-
inator in player capability. Their dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that the ballyhooed
Profile 2, aka BD-Live, player level is merely an optional feature set, not mandatory. Player
manufacturers are not required to accommodate network interactivity.
Players exhibit a range of characteristics. The player Profiles define which functions are
mandatory and which functions may be optional. It is up to the player manufacturer to decide
which optional features, if any, may be implemented in a player. Subsequent player genera-
tions need to fully support all previous features to ensure backwards compatibility of discs.
Blu-ray Disc supports JPEG, PNG, and GIF graphics format files. Each of these formats
has its own advantages and disadvantages — for example, only PNG files support multiple
transparency levels. Here, again, the decoding for each of these image types is implemented
differently in each player depending on the player components, which will cause varying per-
formance results from one player to the next. All of the players are quickest when decoding

While the first generation players do not support the now current level of features, this can
change over time by either upgrading the player firmware and/or releasing successive gener-
ations of players. And, at the same time, newer discs are becoming available that take advan-
tage of the enhanced feature capabilities.

For a disc author, different Profiles mean that their latest applications can possibly use
more sophisticated features but, since first-generation players are still on the market, new
applications have to work with the early players, too. There are ways for disc applications to
query  a player and determine which features are presently implemented. Knowing the level
of the feature implementation allows the disc author to enable or disable specific features on
different players. In this way, disc features can be scaled based on the sophistication of the
player. More enhanced applications can be developed for more sophisticated players, while
basic features would still be available on all players.
Profile 1.1, aka Bonus View, requires advances in the Java VM (virtual machine)™perfor-
mance characteristics of players. Yet, the player manufacturers can adopt different methods
to achieve the desired performance results, thus creating another performance variable
among players. And, disc authors who create applications where a lot of computational oper-
ations are required may end up with extremely different playback performances on devices.
As the market matures, player prices will reflect their feature capabilities. Although we
have passed the Profile 1.1 threshold, manufacturers are not blindly altruistic and can be
expected to continue producing players that meet the Profile 1.1 standard, not exceed it.
Which may be welcomed by those users who merely wish to watch a great looking HD movie
but have no desire to chat with other viewers while doing so.
High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)
The struggle to protect intellectual property is a major cause of the difficulties being faced
by player and by display manufacturers. The desire to view the best possible image generates
the demand for high-resolution, high-definition displays. But the need to protect the content
from illicit duplication has created the unforgiving connection standards that have been
developed, which are in addition to the AACS and BD+ systems for protecting the disc con-
tent. A chief concern is that an HD display could be used as a conduit for recording the
image being presented, or that a player could have its output siphoned off to a recording
device. So a standard was needed that protected the literal connection between the image
source and the image display.
Expanding on the HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) process that was
developed for the Digital Video Interface (DVI), manufacturers are instituting the High-
Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) procedures and connection standards.
HDMI supports television and computer video formats, plus multichannel audio configu-
rations, via a single connection cable. First promulgated in 2002 as HDMI version 1.0, the
technology has matured to version 1.3. Each successive iteration provided for ever-increas-
ing data throughput, growing from 4.9 Gbps with version 1.0 to 10.2 Gbps with version 1.3.
With each new version of standards, devices adopted the new data rate. Unfortunately, this
has lead to the situation where legacy devices that only supported a lower data rate are being
connected to newer devices that recognize and/or output the higher rates. This mismatch of
data capability may create the condition where the HDMI “handshake” between the devices
cannot take place. What occurs subsequent to this connection refusal is the transmission of
a less than optimum image format with an attendant diminution of video and audio quality.

The backwards compatibility of the HDMI 1.3 connection should allow for devices with
the earlier HDMI 1.1 and 1.2 versions to be recognized. These earlier versions support all of
the mandatory audio and video formats of the Blu-ray Disc format. Once again, though, here
is where confusion may be introduced in the connection equation. When multiple devices can
be connected to a display, the display may not have the capability to automatically recognize
the signal being sent to it by a Blu-ray player and does not reset for the newly-connected
source. The display settings need to be manually adjusted before a proper connection can be
sanctioned. The user is then faced with the task of accurately re-setting both devices in order
to establish the best connection.
These security technologies add a great deal of complexity and, alas, confusion to the for-
mat, for the content creators and for the endusers. But, without the protection standards that
have been developed for content and for transmission, the movie studios and content pro-
ducers would not participate in the high-definition presentation arena. So, the difficulty of
working with these protection schemes has become something of a necessary evil.
DisplayPort Interface Standard
The DisplayPort 1.1 interface standard has been established by VESA (Video Electronics
Standards Association) (OMG, yet another committee!!!). Primarily expected to replace
analog VGA and digital DVI connections currently in use for computer hardware,
DisplayPort adds audio capacity, improved color signal passthrough, and enhanced screen
resolution capabilities to a single cable. DisplayPort offers an open standard alternative to
HDMI. As such, there is no inherent royalty cost to manufacturers, whereas HDMI technol-
ogy is licensed by HDMI LLC and the cost for HDMI licensing raises device costs to con-
sumers (see the Licensing section of Chapter 4).
DisplayPort (DP) is fully compatible with HDMI 1.3, and consumers will be able to pur-
chase HDMI-to-DisplayPort adaptors and/or cables. DP supports HDCP and DPCP
(DisplayPort Content Protection)(doh!) thus satisfying the content mavens at the Hollywood
studios and allaying their Digital Rights Management (DRM) concerns.
There are minor differences between DP and HDMI. DP 1.1 supports a maximum band-
width of 10.8 Gbit/s while HDMI supports 10.2 Gbit/s. The connector for DisplayPort is sim-
ilar to that for USB and provides an optional latching mechanism for surer connections.
There is an expected future improvement for DisplayPort that will accommodate multiple
displays in a daisy-chain configuration.
But, the bottom line difference between DisplayPort and HDMI is economics. The PC
industry is supporting DP because they do not have to pay royalties for using it, while a few
companies in the consumer electronics industry developed HDMI and require licensing
agreements for using the HDMI interface.
Fortunately, the ramp-up for DisplayPort incorporation with computers and other devices
is taking longer than initially projected thereby also delaying any confusing impact on the
marketplace.
Oh, did we mention that the DP connector is smaller than the VGA and the DVI connec-
tors that it replaces?

Upscaling DVD
When we first saw the term, upscaling DVD, another phrase came to mind — silk purse.
But, some of the biggest players in the player arena are deadly serious about providing this
feature. What everyone must recognize is that NO DVD-VIDEO PLAYER IS CAPABLE OF
PLAYING NATIVE HIGH-DEFINITION FORMAT VIDEO BECAUSE DVD-VIDEO IS ONLY
STANDARD DEFINITION!1
In the summer of 2008, Toshiba raised the confusion of digitally upscaling standard-defin-
ition DVD to new heights. After losing the HD format war, Toshiba sought to reassert itself
in the optical disc arena by introducing Toshiba XDE™(eXtended Detail Enhancement)
technology. This latest attempt at infusing a “near HD”2 quality presentation when watching
a standard DVD will likely only prolong the general malaise that is affecting the marketplace
when it comes to buying into the latest HD technologies.
Electronics manufacturers have hit on a way to provide purchasers of high-definition tele-
visions with a display size matching video output from a standard DVD-Video player, with
the additional requirement that a digitally secure connection must exist between the devices.
Through the use of specially designed integrated circuit chipsets, the DVD video output may
be scaled to match the desired display setting. These chipsets use various techniques to
achieve the higher display rates, such as line doubling, pixel interpolation or pixel repetition,
enhanced edge detail, deeper color with higher contrast, and some chipsets provide better
pictures than other chipsets.
A standard DVD contains MPEG-2 video encoded as either 525/60 (NTSC) video at 720
pixels by 480 lines or 625/50 (PAL) format video of 720 pixels by 576 lines, and the digital
upscaling recomposes the video to match the 720p, 1080i, or 1080p presentation settings of
the display.
The advantage of having a DVD player perform the upscaling function is that the data
remains in the digital domain. Previously, the DVD video would be converted to analog and
sent to the display as composite, s-video, or component video. The display would then per-
form an analog-to-digital conversion prior to presenting the rescaled imagery on the screen.
An improved viewing capability may be most noticeable when watching a digitally
upscaled output of a progressive-scan DVD player using the HDMI or DVI link. In fact, the
digitally upscaled output is not viewable on any of the player’s analog outputs.
The prices of these upscaling DVD players are considerably below that of a Blu-ray Disc
player or a PlayStation 3 game console. Giving extended, if not new, life to existing DVD col-
lections with an upscaling player may prove very appealing to a significant portion of the
market. But, it is a somewhat surprising case of manufacturers advocating “good enough
quality” as a strategy, which will likely further contribute to the delay in consumer adoption
of true high-definition.

and HD DivX files from DVD-5 or DVD-9 discs.
2Saying that “upscaled SD” is “near HD” is akin to saying the Moon is “near” the Earth. It is true, from a cos-
mic perspective, but when you are gazing up at the Moon while still on Earth it certainly does not look “near”.

Player Types
Generally, there are three types of Blu-ray Disc players — 
j CE (consumer electronics) standalone, or settop, players,
j software players in computer systems with a BD drive, and
j Game consoles, such as the Sony PlayStation 3, that have a BD player.
The three player varieties have very different capabilities in terms of processing power,
memory/storage, and graphics support. Settop players are targeted for the living room with
the main purpose of watching movies, where interactivity provides a heightened user experi-
ence and offers new viewing features. However, a settop player is not designed to be a gam-
ing device, while a game console can provide excellent graphics with a lot of fast-paced inter-
activity, transporting the game player to a different world. Yet, a game console requires more
processing and graphics power which means higher cost. 
The second playback environment, software players in computer systems or media centers,
provides a lot of processing power and memory but may not have the graphics power of a
game console. A computer system provides a more powerful playback environment than a
settop player, but the settop is generally targeted to only playback movies.
The mandatory playback capabilities for players are —
j Video decoder circuitry for MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, and SMPTE VC-1
j Encoded frame rates of 23.976, 24, 29.97, and 59.94 (25 and 50 are optional)
j Audio reproduction capability for —
j Dolby Digital (AC-3), at least two channels
j DTS Digital Surround, at least two channels
j Linear PCM (LPCM) at 48 and 96 kHz, at least two channels
There are three optional audio formats for Blu-ray Disc —
j Dolby Digital Plus, up to 7.1 channels
j Dolby TrueHD, up to 7.1 channels
j DTS-HD Audio™, up to 7.1 channels
Customers should arm themselves with a list of criteria matched to their viewing needs.
Criteria for evaluating player performance spans a diverse list of player characteristics such
as, but not limited to, the following —
j Disc loading time
j Disc access time to playlists or switching applications
j Graphic image loading
j Audio format options
j Persistent storage capacity and speed
j CPU performance
Judging player performance is extremely subjective, and the enduser should recognize that
their expected primary player usage should be the major contributor to their player decision.
Gamers expect a level of player performance that is very different from that of a passive
occupant of a favorite couch or armchair.

Blu-ray Disc Recorders
As the Blu-ray Disc format matures, disc recorders are becoming available for the format3.
These recordable drives are available for installation in laptop or desktop computers, and
may be used in standalone HD disc recorders, too.
BD recordable drives for computers have been introduced worldwide. These are available
in both the internal and the external drive flavors, using recordable and re-recordable (BD-
R/BD-RE) media. Additionally, both single and dual layer discs can be utilized for record-
ing. Manufacturers are working on even higher capacity discs, but it is unlikely that a disc
recorder of greater than dual-layer capacity will be marketed to the general consumer.
It is difficult to pin down the minimum requirements for a computer that incorporates a
high definition optical drive, whether a laptop or a desktop. The data rate and throughput
demands that a 1080p image at 24 frames per second puts on a computer are massive and
relentless. Couple those demands with the typical operating environment of a computer with
its power needs, display needs, media player needs, application needs, and that’s a whole
lotta needs!
Thus the computing power required for HD OD (high definition optical disc) play, let
alone record, remains an area for experimentation and imagination. As a reference, here are
the specifications for the Sony VAIO™ desktop, model VGT-LT39U —
 Intel® Core™ 2 Duo Processor T9300 @ 2.50 GHz
 Two 750 GB hard drives (which, by the way, is 1.5 terabytes!)
 4 GB PC2-5300 DDR2, 667 MHz SDRAM
 NVIDIA® GeForce® 8400M GT graphics card with 256 MB  video RAM
 22” WSXGA display, 1680×1050
 Blu-ray Disc Read/Write (BD-R/-RE/-ROM,DVD±RW/±R DL/RAM,
CD-R/-RW) 
(Interestingly, the display does not natively reproduce 1080 lines. Ah, well...)
Player Connections
The BD format is designed around some of the latest advances in digital audio and video,
yet the players are also designed to work with HD TVs, SD TVs, and video systems of all
varieties, as well as audio systems from monaural to surround. As a result, the back of a play-
er can have a confusing diversity of connectors producing a potpourri of signals.
One of the greatest difficulties for player manufacturers is determining how best to con-
nect legacy equipment. For example, if you are one of the video enthusiasts who purchased
an “HD Ready” television when that meant the TV did not contain an HD tuner and only
supported analog component (Y’PbPr) high-definition inputs, you most likely will not be able
to enjoy the best resolution images from a BD player. The consumer device manufacturers

want to protect their customers while the content industry wants to prevent the high-defini-
tion players from having (unprotected) high-definition analog video outputs. The DVI,
HDMI, and DisplayPort connection standards, in conjunction with disc authoring restric-
tions, can prevent the transmission of digital content to unprotected displays. For those with-
out a secure connection capability, their display may only be able to show a lower-resolution
video stream (see The Analog Sunset section in Chapter 4).
Another of the legacy connection issues that will be confronted by endusers has to do with
digital audio signals. There are millions of A/V receivers on the market that have built-in
decoders for Dolby Digital and/or DTS audio. Regrettably, none of these receivers directly
support Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD, or Dolby TrueHD decoding, and very few provide a
mechanism for delivering up to eight channels of uncompressed audio. In fact, most contin-
ue to sport S/PDIF or Toslink connectors, which are only able to carry up to two channels of
uncompressed audio data. This is particularly problematic when a BD player is added to the
setup because the BD disc formats include audio mixing capabilities that allow commentaries
and sound effects to be mixed in with the feature audio content during playback. This may
pose a problem, because in order to mix audio from different encoded sources, it must all be
decoded in the player and mixed in the uncompressed audio domain. If any of the audio
sources has more than two channels, the mixed result may exceed the capacity of a standard
digital audio connection.
Several solutions are being effectuated for this audio bandwidth problem, among them an
audio encoder embedded in the player that would recompress the high-bandwidth audio data
into, for example, a Dolby Digital 5.1 stream for delivery to the legacy decoder. Other solu-
tions implement a bypass option, in which the user can choose to bypass audio mixing and
send the primary Dolby Digital or DTS-encoded audio stream to his or her external A/V
receiver. Still other options require new A/V receivers to support HDMI or other high band-
width methods for delivering up to eight channels of uncompressed digital audio.
BD players will provide a selection of output signals with a variety of connections —
j  Analog stereo audio. This standard two-channel audio signal can include Dolby
Surround encoding.
j  Digital audio. This raw digital signal can connect to an external digital-to-ana-
log converter or to a digital audio decoder in an A/V receiver. There are two
signal interface formats for digital audio — S/PDIF and Toslink. Both formats
can carry pulse-code modulated (PCM) audio, multichannel Dolby Digital (AC-
3) encoded audio,  and multichannel DTS encoded audio.
j  Composite baseband video. This is the standard video signal for connecting to a
TV with direct video inputs or an audio-visual (A/V) receiver. But, this does
not carry the HDCP protected signal circuitry.
j  S-video (Y/C). This is a higher-quality video signal in which the luminance and
chrominance portions of the signal travel on separate wires within a bundle or
wrapper. As with composite video, this connection type does not provide secure
content protection.
Players

j  Six-, seven-, or eight-channel analog surround. These audio signals from the inter-
nal audio decoder connect to a multichannel amplifier or a “Dolby-Digital-
ready” (AC-3-ready) receiver.
j  Radio-frequency (RF) audio/video. These older-style combined audio and video
signals are modulated onto a VHF RF-carrier for connecting to the antenna
leads of a TV tuner or to a TV cable system connection. Connectors of this type
are provided as a legacy holdover for use with older televisions, as the image
via an RF connector tends to be of a poorer quality.
j  Component analog video (interlaced scan or progressive scan) . These three video
signals (RGB or Y’PbPr) can connect to a TV monitor or video projector.
Although providing a better quality video connection, these component con-
nections do not provide HDCP security, either.
j  IEEE 1394, aka FireWire. This signal type, although in use on a multitude of
consumer electronics devices, is generally used to interface devices with com-
puters.
j  DVI (Digital Visual Interface). Present on some BD players and some display
devices, DVI provides a secure HDCP-compliant data path but is video only.
j  HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface). A secure HDCP-compliant data
interface, HDMI carries both full-bandwidth uncompressed digital video and
multichannel digital audio. This connection type has become the de facto con-
nection standard for the latest consumer electronics devices.
j DisplayPort. DisplayPort is another secure HDCP-compliant data interface,
that carries both video and audio data on a single cable. DisplayPort technolo-
gy is compatible with HDMI and DVI, and offers an optional latching mecha-
nism that alleviates the loose cable syndrome.
j  Ethernet, LAN. An Ethernet signal can be used to interface a player to a com-
puter, a local area network, and to the Internet.
Connection Types
Player connections come in a variety of types. The different audio and video signals may
be present with the following types of connections —
j  RCA phono (Figure 7.1). This is a very common connector type, used for ana-
log audio, digital audio, composite video, and component video.

signals. It also may appear on the front of a player for use with headphones.
j  S-video DIN-4 (Figure 7.4). This connector, also called Y/C, carries separate
chroma and luma video signals on a special four-conductor cable.4
j  Toslink fiberoptic (Figure 7.5). This connector, developed by Toshiba, uses a
fiber optic cable to carry digital audio. One advantage of the fiber optic inter-
face is that it is not affected by external interference and magnetic fields. The
cable should not be more than 30 to 50 feet (10 to 15 meters) in length.

many audio and video signals on a single cable: analog audio, composite RGB
video, component video, and RF. Also called a Euro or Peritel connector.
j  Type F (Figure 7.9). This connector typically carries a combined audio and video
RF signal over a 75-ohm cable. A 75- to 300-ohm converter may be required.

There are two more connection types which do not require physical connectors —
j Wireless networking (WiFi). These connections, based in the IEEE 802.11 local

quency band.

Audio Connections
To hear the audio from a BD player, the player must be connected to an audio system —
a receiver, a control amp or preamp, a digital-to-analog converter, an audio processor, an
audio decoder, an all-in-one stereo, a TV, a boombox, or other equipment designed to
process or reproduce audio.
Digital Audio
The digital audio outputs provide the highest-quality audio signal. This is the preferred
connection for audio systems that have them.
For multichannel audio output, the encoded digital signal bypasses the player’s internal
decoder, and the appropriate decoder is required in the audio receiver or separate audio
processor. For PCM audio output, the PCM signal is sent directly to the digital audio output.
Alternatively, the multichannel decoder in the player may produce the PCM signal, but it is
restricted to a maximum of two output channels when using S/PDIF or Toslink. In either
case, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is required, which may be built in to the receiver
or may be a peripheral device connected to the receiver. Some players provide separate out-
puts for multichannel audio and PCM audio. Other players have either a switch on the back
or a section in their onscreen setup menu where you can choose between PCM output and
multichannel output (undecoded Dolby Digital or DTS audio). The multichannel output
menu option is usually labeled “AC-3” or “Dolby Digital/DTS.”
The digital audio output must be connected to a system designed to accept, at least, PCM,
Dolby Digital (with optional Dolby Digital Plus and Dolby TrueHD), or DTS Digital
Surround (with optional DTS-HD Audio). Most modern digital receivers can automatically
sense the type of incoming signal.
Some players include a dynamic range control setting (also called midnight mode) that
boosts soft audio and reduces loud sound effects. It is recommended that this setting should
be turned off to achieve the best effects with a home theater system, but you may wish to acti-
vate it for situations where the dialogue cannot be clearly heard, such as when everyone else
in the house has gone to bed and the volume is down low.
Additionally, Dolby Digital has a feature called dialog normalization, which is designed to
match the volume level from various Dolby Digital programs or sources. Each encoded audio
source includes information about the relative volume level. Dialog normalization automat-
ically adjusts the playback volume so that the overall level of dialog remains constant. It
Players
7

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

makes no other changes to the audio, including dynamic range; it is equivalent to manually
turning the volume control up or down when a new program is too soft or too loud. Usually,
only one setting exists in a program, which means the volume control does not change in the
middle. Dialog normalization is especially useful with a digital television source to handle
variations in volume when changing channels.
Connecting Multichannel Digital Audio
BD players can send uncompressed (PCM) multichannel digital audio to a display or to
the sound system through an HDMI connection. This is the easiest and the highest quality
option, better even than sending Dolby Digital and DTS to the built-in decoders in the
receiver, as it includes the complete audio mix from the player. Arguments abound about
what kind of cable provides the best sound, but as long as the digital signal makes it through
intact, the audio will be faithfully reproduced. (See A Few Timely Words about Jitter in Chapter
2).
Simply connect the HDMI cable between the player and an HD display or projector, or an
A/V receiver that can do HDMI video switching.
Connecting Two-channel Digital Audio
Two different standards govern the standalone digital audio connection interface: coaxial
and optical. The arguments are many and varied as to which is superior, but since they are
both digital signal transports, high-quality cables and connectors will deliver the exact same
data. Some players have only one type of connector, although many players have both.
Coaxial digital audio connections use the IEC-60958-1 for PCM, also known as S/PDIF
(Sony/Philips Digital Interface Format). Most players use RCA phono connectors, but some
use BNC connectors. Use a 75-ohm rated cable to connect the player to the audio system.
Multichannel connectors usually are labeled “Dolby Digital” or “AC-3.” PCM audio connec-
tors usually are labeled “PCM,” “digital audio,” “digital coax,” “optical digital,” etc. Dual-
purpose connectors may be labeled “PCM/AC-3,” “PCM/Dolby Digital,” or something sim-
ilar. Be sure to use a quality cable; a cheap RCA patch cable may degrade the digital signal
to the point that it will not allow the signal to pass.
Optical digital audio connections may use the EIAJ CP-340 standard, known as Toslink.
Connect an optical cable between the player and the audio  processor. The connectors are
labeled “Toslink,” “PCM/AC-3,” “optical,” “digital,” “digital audio,” or the like.
If the connection (either coaxial or optical) is made to a multichannel audio system, select
Dolby Digital/AC-3 (or DTS or MPEG multichannel) audio output from the player’s setup
menu or via a switch on the back of the player. If the connection is to a standard digital audio
system (including one with a Dolby Pro Logic processor), select the PCM audio output
instead. In cases where a player has an optical (Toslink) connection but the audio system has
a coaxial (S/PDIF) connection, or vice versa, a low-cost converter may be purchased.
Multichannel Analog Audio
A component multichannel audio connection can potentially be as good as a digital audio
connection. However, such outputs use the digital-to-analog converters that are built into a
player, and they may not always be of the highest quality, especially on a low-cost player. The
Players
7 - 1 4

analog signal must be converted back to digital when connected to a digital receiver. If you
have an amplifier with six, seven, or eight multichannel inputs, individual analog audio con-
nections are an appropriate choice, because a Dolby Digital decoder will not be required.
All BD players include a built-in two-channel Dolby Digital audio decoder. Only some
players include a full six-channel decoder along with the multichannel digital-to-analog con-
verters and external connectors necessary to make the decoded audio available. Some play-
ers support the Dolby EX or DTS ES formats, which add a rear center channel. A few play-
ers support eight channels out, decoding DTS Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD, with either
two, six, or eight output connections.
Connecting Multichannel Analog Audio
A multichannel capable player typically has six, seven, or eight RCA or BNC jacks, one for
each channel. Hence, a receiver/amplifier with six to eight audio inputs — or more than one
amplifier — is needed. Hook individual audio cables to the connectors on the player and to
the matching connectors on the audio system. The connectors typically are labeled for each
speaker position: L, LT, or Left; R, RT, or Right; C or Center; LR, Left Rear, LS, or Left
Surround; RR, Right Rear, RS, or Right Surround; Subwoofer or LFE; and sometimes, CR,
Center Rear, CS, or Center Surround. Some receivers use a single DB-25 connector instead
of separate connectors. An adapter cable would be required to convert from DB-25 on one
end to multiple RCA connectors on the other.
Stereo/Surround Analog Audio
A two-channel audio connection is the most widely used option, but it does not have the
quality and discrete channel separation of a digital or multichannel audio connection. All
players include at least one pair of RCA (or sometimes BNC) connectors for stereo output.
Any disc with multichannel audio will be downmixed automatically by the player to Dolby
Surround output for connection to a regular stereo system or a Dolby Surround/Pro Logic
system.
When making connections for a stereo/surround analog audio environment, connect two
audio cables with RCA or BNC connectors to the player. Connect the other ends to a receiv-
er, an amplifier, a TV, or other audio amplification system.
In some cases, the audio input on the stereo system (such as a boom box, if it can be right-
ly called a stereo system) will be a phono or miniphono jack instead of two RCA jacks, thus
an adapter cable becomes necessary. If the player is a portable player with a miniphono con-
nector, a phono-to-RCA adapter cable is usually required to connect the player to the audio
system. If the player includes a phono or miniphono connector for headphones, it generally
is not recommended that the headphone output be used to connect the player to a stereo sys-
tem because the line levels are not appropriate.
Bass and Low-Frequency-Effects
The heart-thumping, seat-shaking excitement of action movies relies heavily on deep,
powerful low-frequency audio effects. BD provides audio quality that is actually superior to

what comes on film for theaters. It is up to the home theater owner (subject to spousal
approval and neighbor tolerance) how close he or she wants to get to a theater sound system.
All the “.1” sound encoding formats provide special channels for low-frequency effects
(LFE). Despite becoming a standard feature, the LFE channel is frequently misunderstood
by producers and listeners. Part of the problem is the LFE channel’s overuse by audio engi-
neers. It is possible, and quite normal, for all  of the bass in a movie to be mixed in the five
main channels, because all are full frequency channels. The LFE channel should be reserved
for extraordinary bass effects, the type that only work well in a full discrete surround system
with at least one subwoofer. Again, though, the same bass effects could be mixed in a 5.0 con-
figuration with no loss or compromise, because modern receivers, particularly those with
Dolby Digital and DTS decoders and a separate subwoofer output, have integrated bass
management. Depending on the speaker configuration, the receiver automatically filters and
routes bass below a certain frequency to the speakers that can reproduce it. For example, if
an audio system has five small bookshelf speakers and a subwoofer, the receiver should send
all the bass below 80 Hz or so to the subwoofer. In an audio system with a few large speak-
ers, some smaller speakers, and a subwoofer or two, the receiver will route low-frequency
audio from all channels to the large speakers and the subwoofers. It does not matter what
channel the bass comes from; all low frequencies from the main channels and the LFE chan-
nel will be sent to every speaker that can handle them.
This is the key to understanding why certain complaints about bass and LFE are ground-
less. A 5.0 mix does not compromise the audio or cheat owners of high-end audio systems,
because all the necessary bass is still in the mix. Omitting the LFE channel when downmix-
ing to two channels is not a terrible thing, because nothing vital rests in the LFE channel —
only, extra “oomph” effects that few two-channel systems can do justice to. This does assume
that the engineer creating the audio mix understands the purpose of the LFE channel and
does not blindly move all low frequencies into it.
Video Connections
To see the video from a BD player, the player must be connected to a video system — a
television, a video projector, a flat-panel display, a video processor, an audio/visual (A/V)
receiver or other equipment capable of displaying or processing a video signal. For those with
a widescreen TV, connection details can become more confusing.
With the exceptions of RF video or HDMI-capable players, audio cables are also required
when connecting a BD player to your system, in addition to a video connection because the
video connections do not carry audio. And, communication becomes a bit trickier when there
are multiple devices fighting over a single display.
For example, a BD player, VCR, cable box, and video game console may all need to be
connected to a TV that has only one video input. In this case, the best option is to use an A/V
receiver, which will switch the video along with the audio. When buying a new A/V receiver,
get as many video inputs as you can afford. You will almost always end up with more video
sources than you initially plan for. If an A/V receiver is out of your price range, then you may
get either a new TV with more video inputs or a manual video switching box.

Most BD players provide three or four video connection options, which are detailed in the
following sections.
Digital Connections
With the emergence of a variety of digital display technologies, and with the adoption of
DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort connection standards, players may now be connected to a dig-
itally equipped display, with no loss of video quality. The digitally encoded data on the disc
stays in a digital realm for presentation on the display.
HDMI and DisplayPort are fully backward compatible with DVI, which allows a DVI
capable display to be connected with HDMI or DisplayPort, using a format adapter cable.
The primary difference between DVI and HDMI (and DisplayPort) is that DVI is video
only. The HDMI and the DisplayPort advantage is that they can contain multichannel digi-
tal audio, too.
Component Video
Prior to the introduction of digital connections, component video was the preferred
method for connecting a player to a video system. A component video output provides three
separate video signals in RGB or Y’PbPr (or Y’, B-Y’, R-Y’) format. These are two different
formats that are not directly interchangeable.
Unlike composite or s-video connections, component signals are discrete and do not inter-
fere with each other. Thus, a component connection is not subject to the picture degradation
that might be caused by video crosstalk.
There are two scan variations for video — interlaced scan and progressive scan.
Interlaced-scan is almost exclusive to standard television.5 Progressive-scan component
video produces a picture with significantly more detail than interlaced scan component video
and requires a progressive scan display. Depending on the disc content, including content
protection constraints, 1080p video may not be allowed on component outputs.
Connecting Component Video
Some players, notably U.S. and Japanese models, have Y’PbPr component video output in
the form of three RCA phono or three BNC connectors. The connectors may be labeled “Y,”
“U,” and “V,” or “Y,” “Pb,” and “Pr,” or “Y,” “B-Y,” and “R-Y,”6 they may be colored green,
blue, and red, respectively.
Some players, notably European models, have RGB component video output via a
SCART connector or via three RCA phono or three BNC connectors. The RGB connectors
are generally labeled “R,” “G,” and “B” and may be colored to match. Hook a SCART cable
from the player to the video system, or hook three video cables from the three video outputs
of the player to the three video inputs of the video system.

5Do not be confused by the difference between an interlaced signal (or source) and an interlaced display. Blu-
ray Discs can contain 1080-line video in either interlaced (1080i) or progressive (1080p) format. Almost all
high-definition display technology — including LCD, DLP, and plasma — is progressive. Even a display that
only accepts a 1080i signal must convert it to progressive format — often at a lower resolution — before it
can display it.
6Many players label the YPbPr connectors as YCbCr. This is incorrect because YCbCr refers only to digital
component video signals, not analog component video signals.

S-Video
Some BD players have an s-video (Y/C) output, which generally provides a better picture
than composite video output, unless the s-video cable is very long. In fact the picture from an
s-video connection is only slightly inferior to a component connection. S-video provides more
detail, better color, and less color bleeding than composite video. Another advantage of s-
video is that the luma (Y) and chroma (C) signals are carried separately. The player down-
scales HD video when sent over an s-video connection. It also letterboxes widescreen video
to fit into a 4:3 picture ratio unless you choose the player setting that tells it a widescreen dis-
play is connected.
Connecting S-Video
When making an s-video connection, use an s-video cable from the player to the video sys-
tem. The round, 4-pin connectors may be labeled Y/C, s-video, or S-VHS.
Composite Video
This is the most common but lowest-quality connection. All players have standard base-
band video connectors, the same type of output provided by VCRs, low-cost camcorders, and
video game consoles. This signal is also called composite video baseband signal (CVBS). The
player downscales HD video when sent over a composite video connection. It also letterbox-
es widescreen video to fit into a 4:3 picture ratio unless you choose the player setting that
tells it a widescreen display is connected.
Connecting Composite Video
For composite connections, use a standard video cable from the player to the video sys-
tem. If the connector is an RCA phono type, it is usually yellow. Connectors may also be
BNC type. The connector may be labeled “video,” “CVBS,” “composite,” or “baseband,” etc.
RF Audio/Video
This is the worst way to connect a player to a television and is only provided by a few play-
ers for compatibility with older televisions that only have an antenna or cable connection.
The RF signal carries both audio and video modulated onto a VHF carrier frequency, the
type of output frequently provided by VCRs and cable boxes.
Connecting RF Audio/Video
For an RF connection, use a coaxial cable with type F connectors from the player to the
antenna input of the TV. The connectors may be labeled “RF,” “TV,” “VHF,” “antenna,”
“Ch. 3/4,” or something similar. If the TV antenna connection has two screws rather than a
screw-on terminal, a 75- to 300-ohm adapter is needed.
If you have a TV with only RF antenna inputs, you will need to either get a player with RF
output or an RF modulator ($20 to $30). The RF modulator is connected to the player com-
posite video output. (And, we may have mentioned it already, but if you have a TV with only
RF connectors it may be time to get a new TV.)

BD Player User Tools
BD players will provide an increased level of user interaction with the player and with the
disc content, including support for added devices, such as mice, joysticks, game controllers
and keyboards. Further, many of the applications envisioned for players require a far more
sophisticated level of control than what the traditional remote control offers. Many players
offer standardized Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports to allow connections from a wide range
of devices. BD also supports generic controller programming interfaces that make it possible
for advanced applications to support new types of controllers yet to be conceived.
One of the most notable additions to the BD players is the ability to access data from loca-
tions other than the disc itself. Specifications for BD include persistent storage and network
downloads. This makes it possible to deliver applications and presentation data (video,
audio, graphics, and subtitles) via home networks and the Internet, as well as to store and
later retrieve that data from persistent storage. The amount of persistent storage and stor-
age type varies from player to player. Some players also may provide a slot for flash memo-
ry cards and/or a USB socket for an external hard drive.
BD players have a complex demultiplexer and presentation engine that includes both pri-
mary and secondary decoders, and complex data pathways that quickly adapt to different
content scenarios. For instance, the format supports secondary video that can play simulta-
neously with the feature video in a picture-in-picture (PIP) configuration. Likewise, a sec-
ondary audio decoder can be used to stream network-delivered audio commentaries that are
decoded and mixed in realtime with the movie as it plays back. The BD players also support
realtime audio mixers that can combine both primary and secondary audio content along
with additional sound effects.
Perhaps the most obvious addition to a BD player differentiating it from the standard
DVD model is an interactive graphics engine. The BD format supports strong general pro-
cessing capabilities for creating advanced, media-rich user experiences. This includes a script
processor or virtual machine, large amounts of system memory, complex input controllers,
and a whole suite of graphics scalers and compositors that can blend high definition video,
sub video, interactive graphics, and subtitles, for realtime presentation.
BD Player Remote Control
Blu-ray players are being built by a number of companies. And, the primary interface to a
BD player is a wireless remote control. As with DVD, button functions can be blocked or
rendered inactive by the programming of the disc.
The button layout and additional functions on a remote control are left to the individual
manufacturer. Pioneer, for example, provides television control buttons for displays that can
be programmed by an alternative remote control. Figure 7.14 presents a sample remote con-
trol layout. A remote control should contain —

the main menu for the disc.
The Menu key is intended to
take you to the menu that is
most appropriate for your cur-
rent location on the disc, and
may be a common button with
Popup Menu.
The Return key should perform
the valuable function of taking
you up a level, somewhat like
the Back button on a Web

The Resume key can be used
to continue playing the disc
content from the point it was
last playing, depending on the
user actions that took place
subsequent to suspending the
playing of the feature.
The Color keys are available
to the disc author for use as
they deem fit. The keys allow
for extended functionality and
disc-based applications to be
executed on a title-by-title
basis.

How to Get the Best Picture and Sound
Now that digital connections are possible between a player and a display, it requires new
purchases of digital-capable devices. Digital connections provide a surety of copyright pro-
tection that is not possible with analog signals. We certainly recommend that you create an
all-digital connection environment.
Beyond the connection scheme that you choose, one of the most important steps to get-
ting better picture and sound is to adjust the television display properly. Reduce the sharp-
ness control on the display. Video from BD is much clearer than from traditional analog
sources. The display’s sharpness feature adds an artificial high-frequency boost and it exag-
gerates the high frequencies and causes distortion, just as the treble control set too high for
a CD causes it to sound harsh. An overly sharp display can create a shimmering or ringing
effect. Reduce the brightness control, as it is usually set too high, as well.
If you get audio hum or noisy video, it is probably caused by interference or a ground loop.
Interference can be reduced with an adequately shielded cable. The shorter the cable, the
better is the result. You may be able to isolate the source of the interference by turning off
all equipment except the pieces you are testing. Try moving things farther apart or plugging
them into a different circuit. Wrap your entire house in tinfoil. If those steps do not remove
the hum or noise, make sure all equipment is plugged into the same circuit. If nothing works,
then it may be time to get a new display, as the culprit may be the set’s power supply.
It may be hard to believe, but displays are not necessarily adjusted properly in the factory.
Get your display professionally calibrated, or calibrate it yourself. A correctly calibrated dis-
play is adjusted to proper color temperature, visual convergence, and so on, resulting in accu-
rate colors and skin tones, straight lines, and a more accurate video reproduction than is gen-
erally provided by a television when it comes out of the box. Organizations such as the
Imaging Science Foundation (ISF) train technicians to calibrate televisions using special
equipment. Another option is to use Joe Kane’s Digital Video Essentials disc.
Connect the player to a good sound system. This may sound like a strange way to improve
the picture, but numerous tests have shown that when viewers are presented with identical
pictures and two different quality levels of audio, they perceive the picture that is accompa-
nied by high-quality audio to be better than the picture associated with low-quality audio.
Viewing Distance
A great deal of research has gone into human visual acuity and how it relates to viewing
distance, information size, and display resolution. Viewing distance is often measured in dis-
play screen heights. In general, the best viewing distance is about 3 to 5 times the screen
height. Some industry recommendations vary from 2 to 10 times the screen height (the lower
the number, the more likely it’s the optometry industry). If you sit too close to the screen,
you will see video scanline structures and pixels. If you sit too far away, you will lose visual
detail and will not engage enough of your field of view to draw you into the experience. The
optimal viewing experience is to fill about 35 degrees of your field of vision while staying
beyond the limit of picture resolution. The THX recommendation is a 36 degree viewing
angle, whereas, SMPTE recommends a 30 degree viewing angle. There is disagreement
Players
7
7 - 2 1
Blu-ray Disc Demystified

about the dimensions of the average human field of view, especially as it relates to watching
video, but the vertical range is about 60 to 90 degrees, whereas the horizontal angle varies
from 100 to 150 degrees, depending on the individual.7 Viewing angle fields broader than
about 40 degrees, however, can make the viewer uncomfortable after a period of time
because human vision tends to focus toward the center.
Often the resolution of the display determines the distance at which viewers naturally sit.
Psychophysical studies have shown that viewers tend to position themselves relative to a
scene so that the smallest detail of interest subtends an angle of about 1 minute of arc, which
is the limit of discrimination for normal vision. This gives an ideal viewing distance of 3,438
pixels, which for a 1920-pixel picture is 1.8 times the screen width, providing a 32-degree field
of view (32×60=1920). For a 1280-pixel image it is 2.7, but that provides only a 21-degree
viewing angle. Moving closer in to the SMPTE-recommended distance (1.9 times width for
30 degrees) means you may see the individual pixels at 1.4 times resolution.
Compatibility
Attempting to understand optical disc compatibility could wring tears from a granite
plinth. It does not help that compatibility has many facets and meanings that become increas-
ingly complex as formats have been developed for CD, DVD, HD DVD, BD, and beyond.
There is backward compatibility, such as Blu-ray players being able to play DVDs and CDs.
There is forward compatibility (or usually lack of), such as DVD players not being able to
play Blu-ray discs, or Blu-ray players perhaps being able to play future multi-layer discs or
3D movies. There is sideways compatibility — being able to play related formats, such as,
DVD players that play DivX files or Blu-ray players that play AVCHD recordings from disc
or memory card. And, there is also compatibility within a format or format family, which is
always expected but does not always work, such as CD players that cannot play CD-Rs or
Blu-ray players that cannot play some BD-RE discs.
The Blu-ray specifications focus more on the discs, file systems, and application formats
than on the players. There are profiles, performance minimums, and certain functional
requirements but, beyond that, player makers are free to implement the specifications as
they see fit. Unfortunately, failures of compatibility occur at various levels across the range
of optical disc technology — at the physical level, the logical level (file system and applica-
tion), and the implementation level (see Table 7.2). Compatibility problems are also dis-
cussed in Chapter 9, including problems outside of the player, such as HDMI snags.

There are some compatibility problems, especially
with early players, where the disc is not quite in spec
and a finicky player cannot read it
A BD player cannot play a
BD
Application
The disc may contain some other form of data not
recognized by the player, such as, a Sony PlayStation
3 game.
A BD player can only play
part of a BD
Application
The disc may use Profile 2 features, which are not
fully supported by Profile 1.1 or Profile 1 players.
Implementation
The BD formats, especially BD-J, are very complex.
It's possible the disc has errors on it or the player
may have bugs that cause problems with some discs.
A BD player cannot play a

corder
Application
Many BD camcorders record in the AVCHD format,
which only some BD players can play.

Although they are both HD formats, HD DVD is
physically very different from BD, and they are not

Application
Essentially all BD players can play standard DVDs
and CDs, but the disc may have computer data on it
or otherwise not be in standard DVD-Video or
Audio CD format.
A BD player cannot play a
recorded DVD
Application
The disc might be in DVD-VR format or in
AVCREC (BDAV recording on recordable DVD
media) or AVCHD format, which not all BD players
recognize. The disc may contain computer data or
other non-standard format.
A DVD player cannot
play a BD
Physical
BDs are very different from DVDs and are not com-
patible with DVD players, except for hybrid discs
that combine both formats on a single disc. But even
these discs sometimes do not work on DVD players
that are confused by the BD layer.
Application
The AVCREC format stores BD video on a stan-
dard, red-laser DVD, but although the player can
read data from the disc, it does not understand the
format.

Physical Compatibility
Physical compatibility is almost never an issue with the base BD-ROM format. Every play-
er and drive is physically able to read data from BD-ROM discs, the kind that are mass repli-
cated in a manufacturing plant. Players may not know what to do with the data or may not
attempt to read certain sections of the disc, but they are capable of reading the bits. Physical
compatibility is sometimes a problem with the recordable formats, as illustrated in Table 7.2.
It is not as bad as with CD and DVD, where the recordable formats were not developed until
after the ROM format was launched but, unfortunately, there are still reports of Blu-ray
players not reading recorded discs. Physical compatibility may apply to other formats, such
as, DVD and CD, where itis up to the manufacturer to decide whether or not to support a
particular physical medium. This is especially true with some BD recordable drives that can-
not write to recordable CDs or DVDs.
File System Compatibility
File system compatibility is generally not a problem. The file system determines how the
data is organized and accessed. BD-ROM discs use UDF 2.5, and BD-RE (v2 and v3) discs
use UDF 2.6. Because recordable Blu-ray discs are, at heart, simply storage media, other file
systems such as Microsoft NTFS, Macintosh HFS, and Unix can potentially be used to write
data files to the disc, but these OSes normally use UDF when writing to BD. The original 1.0
version of BD-RE, released in 2003, used a custom file system, BD-FS, which is not com-
patible with much of anything beyond original BD-RE recorders.
Application Compatibility
Application compatibility is the most confusing area. It is not always clear why a disc does
not work in a given player, since it may not be obvious which application formats the player
supports. For example, a Blu-ray player can read the data on an AVCREC disc recorded by
a Blu-ray recorder, but it may not recognize the format, at all, or it may be able to read the
format but be incompatible with peculiarities of the video streams on the disc. BD players
are not required to support the BDAV format used on recordable discs — some do and some
do not. Both the player and the disc carry the Blu-ray Disc logo, but it may not be clear why
they do not work together. The proliferation of related application formats such as BDAV,
AVCREC, and AVCHD, along with other custom formats for computers and game consoles,
places a burden on the consumer to understand which discs use which application formats
and which players can play them.
Profile Compatibility
Blu-ray profile compatibility is a form of application compatibility. The Blu-ray specifica-
tion defines several profiles for players that have different feature sets (see Table 7.1). The
good news is that the discs themselves are usually designed to play on a less-featured player
Players
7 - 2 4
7
Blu-ray Disc Demystified

by hiding or blocking parts that require advanced features to play. Still, it can be confusing
to buy a disc that touts features on the package, only for some of those features to not work
on a basic player.
Implementation Compatibility
Implementation compatibility has to do with flaws or omissions in players (including com-
puter software players) or in discs. Some players are poorly designed, whereas, others behave
in unexpected ways with unanticipated content. Each player implements the Blu-ray specifi-
cations in slightly different ways, complicated by the fact that the specification is sometimes
unclear or confusing. The result is that discs may play differently or not at all in different
players.
Implementation errors also can occur on the production side. A bug might exist in the
encoder or in the system used to author the disc. Content, such as, graphics, fonts, and file
packages, may be malformed. The person who authored the disc may have violated the Blu-
ray specification or written improper BD-J code. Programming on some discs is so complex
or inefficient that it places too heavy a load on underpowered players. Any of this can result
in a disc that will not work on some or all players. 
Backward Compatibility
Player manufacturers have it rough in the digital age. No one ever expected cassette tape
players to play old reel-to-reel tapes or eight-track tapes, but today it would be suicidal for a
manufacturer to produce a Blu-ray player that cannot play DVDs and CDs. And the player
is also expected to make DVDs look better with progressive video, upscaling, and image pro-
cessing. Luckily, anyone who owns a large collection of DVDs can count on backwards com-
patibility of future players. DVDs will only become "obsolete" in the sense that you might
want to replace them with new high-definition versions. However, Blu-ray discs are not
playable in older DVD players unless they are hybrid discs containing both Blu-ray and DVD
layers.
Dealing with Compatibility Problems
The complexity of the Blu-ray format variations, infused with other optical disc formats,
gives Mr. Murphy8 plenty of room to work. The end result is that consumers cannot assume
that any disc with "Blu-ray" or "BD" on it will work in every player or computer with a "Blu-
ray" or "BD" label.
The BDA, many of whose members cut their teeth with DVD, have tried hard to avoid the
playback incompatibility problems that arose with DVD, especially in the early days. There
are significant mandatory testing requirements that come along with the Blu-ray Disc logo.
In fact, new test discs are released frequently, which continues to raise the quality bar. From

8That is Mr. Murphy of the infamous Murphy's Law. In some circles, it is Mr. Finagle who is hard at work.

the end of 2005 to the end of 2008, the number of test discs used for BD-ROM logo verifi-
cation increased from just over 10 to over 30, with the total test cases on the discs number-
ing in the thousands. In some cases, players are required to be updated to work with new test
discs. This is a radical concept in the world of consumer electronics — that a device shipped
into the marketplace could have mandatory upgrade requirements. Therefore, virtually all
Blu-ray players come with an Ethernet port for connecting to the Internet to download
firmware upgrades.
BD-J is at least an order of magnitude more complex than DVD. Because DVD was made
up of reasonably straightforward streams of video, audio, and subpictures, combined with a
simple command set, it was possible to run a disc through a verifier program that would flag
errors and avert problems. BD-J, on the other hand, is made up of more complex video and
audio streams, plus secondary video and audio streams, plus often thousands of small com-
ponents for menus, graphics, menu noises, text, and more, all of which can come from the
disc or from local storage after being downloaded, and the whole enchilada is held together
by a full-fledged programming language with infinitely variable complexity and potential for
bugs. It borders on miraculous that Blu-ray players and discs work together as well as they
do.

Myths
Urban legends have been around as long as urbs, and myths have existed even longer.
Inevitably, every new technology brings with it a perplexity of misunderstanding, misinfor-
mation, and usually a few conspiracy theories. In the case of Blu-ray Disc™, the war with HD
DVD made things even worse as people let their facts wander off without a leash, biting
bystanders at random. Official and unofficial supporters of each camp lobbed nuggets of
half-truths into the fray — “Blu-ray manufacturing will never make it out of the laboratory;”
“Blu-ray has better picture;” “HD DVD has better picture;” “Blu-ray has region control and
HD DVD doesn’t;” “Blu-ray requires so many complex features such as Java™and picture
in picture that players can’t be built;” “Blu-ray doesn’t have enough mandatory features such
as picture-in-picture and an Internet connection,” and so on. After Blu-ray hit the market,
and then after the format war ended, some myths quickly met their well-deserved deaths, but
many others continue to circulate like urban legends of microwaved cats and stolen kidneys.
This chapter tackles myths that will not die, myths that sound true until you think about
them for a minute, and myths that even some respectable people bought into whose names
we’re keeping secret for a whole bunch of money. Some myths are not strictly wrong, but
reflect a misunderstanding of a particular fundamental aspect of Blu-ray technology and
raise the hackles of your curmudgeonly book authors. In other words, any sort of incorrect
or inaccurate statement about Blu-ray is fair game in this chapter.
Myth: “Blu-ray Is Revolutionary”
The printing press was revolutionary. Television was revolutionary. Even CDs can be con-
sidered revolutionary because they were a completely new way of storing digital audio and
computer data on a compact optical disc. But Blu-ray is fundamentally an evolution from
DVD, which was itself an evolution of CD and a refinement of Video CD.
Sure, Blu-ray provides unprecedented ability to interact with video, but this is merely tak-
ing DVD to the next level. BD-Live features, such as, Internet-based updates of actor infor-
mation and dubbing in new downloaded audio tracks are very cool, but most of these were
pioneered by InterActual and others using PC playback of DVD. Blu-ray technology is
remarkable, and can be used for some impressive things — controlling movie playback from
an iPhone or sending e-mail between Blu-ray players — but it is not a radically different, or
an even mildly disruptive, technology.
Myth: “Blu-ray Will Fail” 
Early in the lifecycle of DVD, herds of pundits predicted that it would be a flop, joining
the ranks of other neglected consumer electronic innovations such as quadraphonic sound,
the 8-track tape, the Tandy/Microsoft VIS, and the digital compact cassette. It is safe to say,
at this point, that those people should not take up careers as fortune tellers.

As the wheel turns for a new technology cycle, even more couch prognosticators have pre-
dicted that Blu-ray will fail. They argue that it is too little too late, that people are turning to
the Internet and VOD (video on demand) for content, or that most people are happy with
DVD and will not bother moving up to Blu-ray. Some even claim that because Sony was
responsible for such failures as Betamax, MiniDisc (in some countries), SACD, and UMD, it
has branded a large L on the forehead of Blu-ray. Of course, these Sony-smearers neglect to
mention the Trinitron TV, Walkman, CD, and DVD.
It is true that the window of opportunity for new technology grows smaller all the time, as
evidenced by such not-quite-failures as S-VHS, DVD-Audio, and DualDisc, and it is true that
Blu-ray is not as big a step up as DVD was from VHS, but Blu-ray simply has too much
behind it to fail. It will probably not achieve the massive success of DVD, which begat over
a billion playback devices around the world in less than a decade and transformed the world
of home video, but by almost any measure, Blu-ray is and will continue to be a success. In its
first year of existence it sold more players and discs than DVD did in its first year. Granted,
Blu-ray had the PlayStation 3 to thank for beating DVD player numbers, and it is riding the
coattails of DVD, but that is one of the very reasons for its inevitable success. Dozens of the
world’s biggest consumer electronics companies and computer companies provide Blu-ray
products. And the shift from standard definition to high definition will ineluctably pull Blu-
ray along with it.
Myth: “We’ll Soon Get Everything From the Internet and Discs
Will Go the Way of Dinosaurs”
Change “soon” to “eventually, a few decades after the introduction of Blu-ray,” and, well,
it’s still a myth. It is reasonable to expect that more and more video in homes and workplaces
will be delivered over the Internet. Short-format video (think YouTube and news clips) will
make the transition sooner than long-format video. In the very long run people will watch
more movies and other video from the Internet than from disc. But physical media will not
become marginalized before 2020 at the earliest and will not disappear for decades after that.
See the concluding section of Chapter 13, Blu-ray and Beyond for an analysis that makes this
clear.
Myth: “Some Discs Won’t Play If the Player Doesn’t Have an
Internet Connection”
This fable stems from the BD-Live feature that provides for additional content over an
Internet connection. Not all Blu-ray players have an Internet connection, but discs that incor-
porate enhanced features, such as picture in picture, are designed to disable those features
if the player cannot support them. It is possible to design a disc so it will not work if there is
no Internet connection, but only lunatics or sadists would intentionally do this. Most of the
content on every disc, such as the main feature, plays fine on every Blu-ray player.

Myth: “BD-Live Discs Don't Work on All Players”
See the myths preceding and following this one.
Myth: “Profile 2 (BD-Live) Players and Discs Make Previous
Players Obsolete”
This myth is fueled by the perception that Profile 2 (BD-Live) players have extra features
that Profile 1 players do not have. However, the only requirements that Profile 2 adds are
that players have a network connection and extra local storage to hold downloaded files.
Otherwise, player functionality and performance are essentially the same Profile 1 players
will continue to work, and will play all but the "connected" parts of BD-Live discs.
Myth: “Profile 3 and Profile 4 or Future Profiles Will Make
Previous Players Obsolete”
Profile 3 (audio-only players) and Profile 4 (recording and editing for camcorders, Blu-ray
video recorders, and PCs) are actually subsets of Profile 1. Even though they use a bigger
number and sound better, they are restricted versions of the format for specialized products.
It is possible that, in the future, the BDA will define a higher performance profile but, by
that time, there will be tens of millions of Profile 1 and 2 players in the marketplace, so discs
that took advantage of an extended protocol would be designed to still work, at least in part,
on older players.
Myth: “The BDA Will Soon Mandate that All BD Players Have
an Internet Connection”
The BDA has no plans to make Profile 2 (BD-Live) or Internet connections mandatory
for all players. As the cost of manufacturing players continues to fall and as player makers
contrive to differentiate their players from all the others, it may very well come to pass that
most or all new Blu-ray players implement Profile 2. In any case, although Profile 2 players
have the capacity to connect to the Internet, they are not required to be connected. (See the
next myth.)
Myth: “If You Unplug Your Profile 2 (BD-Live) Player From the
Internet It Will Stop Working”
The BDA does not send unmarked black vans to cruise neighborhoods and harass people
who have not plugged their player into the Internet. In fact, some Blu-ray players provide a
setting to prohibit Internet access from BD-Live discs. If your player is not connected or if
your Internet connection is not working for any of a dozen possible reasons, only the portions

of discs that depend on content from the Internet will not work or will not be fully featured.
For example, some BD-Live discs download updated information about cast and crew. If
there is no Internet connection then they simply show information that was put on the disc
when it was produced.
Myth: “All Blu-ray Discs Must Use AACS”
It is true that all pre-recorded (replicated) Blu-ray Discs must use AACS content protec-
tion. By requiring that the discs that are most likely to be legitimate always have AACS
encryption, it makes it easier to identify illegal copies.  However, recordable discs (BD-R and
BD-RE) are not required to used AACS. BD-ROM Mark is also mandatory on pre-record-
ed discs, but BD+ is optional. See Chapter 4 for more on content protection.
Myth: “AACS Is Required for HDMV, BD-J, Network Access, or
Local Storage Access”
HDMV and BD-J can be used on BD-R and BD-RE disc, which do not require AACS.
BD-J applets must be signed in order to access the Internet or local storage. Application
signing keys are not the same as AACS keys, but this seems to have caused some of the con-
fusion that created this myth. BD-J applications must have a set of certificates with a valid
chain of keys (from the content owner, authoring facility, replication facility, and so on) in
order to used some of the Profile 2 features. However, this does not guarantee that BD-J
content on a BD-R or a BD-RE disc will play on all players, since players are not required
to play recordable discs. The best way to be sure of playback compatibility is to check for a
BD-R/BD-RE logo on the player.
Myth: “AACS, BD+, and BD-Live Allow Studios to Spy on
Consumers”
Internet forums and blogs are full of “Big Brother” conspiracy theories and gripes about
Blu-ray players enabling invasion of privacy. Some player manuals contain notes, such as,
"When discs supporting BD-Live are played back, the player or disc IDs may be sent to the
content provider via the Internet,"1 but this does not mean that your name, address, and
credit card are being collected by insidious marketing machines. In order to download con-
tent associated with a particular disc, the online service has to know which disc it is. And, to
support features, such as movie e-mail between players, the online service has to keep track
of the player. Viewing and usage patterns may be tracked and reported in aggregate, to help
studios figure out what online features on which disc are most popular, for example, but not
with user-identifying information, especially if you have not entered such information into
the player. If you are still concerned about this issue, check the privacy policy on the content
provider's Web site or ask them to give you a copy of their privacy policy.

Myth: “Blu-ray Doesn’t Look Any Better Than Upconverted
DVD”
There is some (well, really, only a little) truth to this one, but it is a bit like saying that
DVD does not look any better than VHS, which is accurate only if you are watching it on a
13-year-old, 13-inch television. Experts agree that the difference between Blu-ray and DVD
picture quality becomes imperceptible below a certain screen size, but the experts do not
agree on what that size is, especially since it depends on how close the viewing position is.
One thing that is certain is that a Blu-ray picture has five to six times more pixels than a DVD
picture. That’s a huge difference which is clearly visible on a good quality display at typical
big-screen viewing distances. As digital displays get bigger and better, the difference becomes
more obvious. Tests have shown that the difference also becomes more obvious after viewers
become accustomed to HD and then revert to an SD picture that in comparison looks much
blurrier than before. And, it does not matter how good the upsampling feature of the DVD
player or the display is, no upscaling technology — no matter how ingenious — can accu-
rately extrapolate 500 percent more information if it was never there to begin with.
Myth: “Blu-ray Players Downconvert Analog Video”
Blu-ray players must respect the image constraint token (ICT), a copy deterrent feature of
AACS, that allows the content author to set a flag on the disc that makes the player down-
convert 1920×1080 digital video to 960×540 resolution on analog outputs. It is true that
using a digital video output with HDCP is the only guarantee that the full resolution will
always be used, but very few discs have ICT turned on. Around the time Blu-ray was intro-
duced, most Hollywood studios stated they had no plans to use ICT. This may change down
the road when digital video connections are more pervasive, but unless high-definition ana-
log video recorders become common — which is highly improbable — content owners still
have little reason to discomfit the legitimate users who have analog displays.
Myth: “DVD Players Can Be Upgraded to Play Blu-ray Discs”
Believe it or not there was a class-action lawsuit on behalf of DVD player owners who
claimed that the promise of disc playback compatibility meant that their DVD players should
play Blu-ray discs. This is akin to expecting a horse-drawn wagon to be easily upgraded to an
automobile because they both carry people. It is hard to believe that there are people dumb
enough to think this, but it is not so hard to believe that there are lawyers smart enough to
pretend they are this dumb. In any case, it is simply not true. Even if DVD players had pow-
erful enough processors to handle a software upgrade for HDMV and BD-J processing
(which they don’t), DVD players do not have the necessary high-definition video decoders,
video circuitry, blue-laser optics, copy protection accoutrements, and many other critical
functions required to play Blu-ray Discs.

Myth: “Older Blu-ray Players Can Be Upgraded to New Profiles”
This is not as absurd as upgrading a DVD player, but it is only possible if the player was
specifically designed with the necessary features from the beginning. Profile 1.1 added sec-
ondary video and audio playback requirements to Profile 1. An extra decoder chip and video
overlay hardware cannot just be popped into a player, and there simply is not enough horse-
power in standard Profile 1 players to add decoding support with a software update.
Likewise, Profile 2 added Internet access and additional local storage requirements, so
unless a Profile 1.1 player is already equipped with a connector and necessary networking
features, and memory slots or a USB connector for a hard drive, it cannot just be upgraded
with a wave of the magic software wand.
The Sony PlayStation 3 is an exception that proves the rule, as Sony provided a down-
loadable firmware update in December 2007 to add Profile 1.1 features and, in March 2008,
released another firmware update that made PlayStation 3 the first Profile 2 Blu-ray player.
These upgrades were possible only because the PlayStation 3 is a high-powered system with
plenty of memory, video processing features, and full Internet connectivity.
Myth: “Existing Receivers with Dolby Digital and DTS Decoding
Work Perfectly With Blu-ray Players”
In some cases, existing receivers connected to a Dolby Digital or DTS bitstream output
only reproduce the primary audio track. Blu-ray has the ability to mix in one or two addi-
tional audio sources — a secondary audio track, such as, a director commentary on the disc
or streamed over the Internet, and interactive audio, such as button sounds in an HDMV
menu or sound effects in a BD-J interactive application. Mixing must be done using uncom-
pressed audio, so the player must first decode the primary and the secondary audio tracks.
In certain cases, with players designed certain ways, and with certain audio formats on the
disc2 the player is required to re-encode the mixed audio in Dolby Digital (not Dolby Digital
Plus) or DTS (not DTS-HD) before output. Many Blu-ray players re-encode mixed audio
but, to reproduce all the possible audio from a Blu-ray player, without any quality loss from
re-encoding, the receiver must have an HDMI input or a multichannel audio input. The
upshot is that there is little value in having Dolby Digital and DTS decoders outside of the
Blu-ray player.

and the moon is waning on a Tuesday night.

apparently confusing enough that even people who ought to know better got caught up in a
bit of circular reasoning along these lines: when the US switches from analog to digital, old
televisions will not work anymore, so the analog connections will be unusable. Of course this
is silly when you think about it — the Federal Communications Commission does not have
the power to reach out to all the TVs in the US and make them stop accepting analog inputs.
The only thing that stops in February 2009 is analog broadcasting.
Analog video from DVD players, Blu-ray players, and other sources such as cable televi-
sion still works fine. However, do not get confused in the other direction and think that the
HDTV digital-to-analog converter boxes will make a high-definition Blu-ray player work
with a standard-definition television. The converter is a digital tuner with analog output, not
a general purpose downconverting adapter.
Myth: “Blu-ray Manufacturing Is Too Intricate and Too
Expensive”
This was favorite ammunition of Blu-ray bashers during the format war, based on the fact
that disc manufacturing lines required all-new Blu-ray equipment, whereas only an upgrade
to existing DVD equipment was necessary to handle HD DVD manufacturing. But, it never
held much water. Some people claimed that dual-layer Blu-ray disc production was so com-
plicated and prone to low yields that it would never be commercially feasible. Blu-ray disc
manufacturing is indeed trickier than DVD production but, within a year of launch, most
major titles were released on dual-layer discs. The cost issue is also overblown. Shortly after
launch, Blu-ray Disc manufacturing costs were only a dollar or two more than DVD (and less
than a dollar more than HD DVD), and the retail price difference more than made up for
this. Had HD DVD survived longer, the price difference would have steadily narrowed until
it was negligible. A price difference of, say, 50 cents, can be made to look like a mountain or
a molehill — for a top-ten motion picture that sells ten million discs it is an extra $5 million,
which is nothing to sneeze at, but it is less than three percent of the sales from the disc.3
Regardless of the relative increase in Blu-ray manufacturing costs compared to DVD or HD
DVD, it can be worked into the pricing model so that it makes no difference to studio rev-
enue and does not break the bank for consumers.
Myth: “The Blu-ray Disc Association Prohibits Adult Content”
The BDA does not police content on discs, and does not prohibit any particular type of
content, including “x-rated.” This myth may hav stemmed from a report that Sony was
approached early on by adult content creators interested in putting their product on Blu-ray
and promoting the format. The consumer electronics giant purportedly stated that as a com-
pany, Sony did not support or wish to promote that kind of content. Individual replication

Blu-ray discs started out more expensive than DVDs, so 50 cents is an even smaller share.

facilities may disallow certain types of content, especially if required by their customers4, but
the simple fact that adult titles are plentiful on Blu-ray puts this one to bed, so to speak.
Myth: “Blu-ray Is a Worldwide Standard”
Not quite. Blu-ray does not have some of the incompatible variants that DVD was saddled
with from being closely tied to the standard-definition NTSC and PAL television formats. For
example, Blu-ray discs primarily use a 1920×1080 picture resolution regardless of the coun-
try they are intended to play in5, but video for “50 Hz” areas — such as most of Europe —
is often encoded at 25 frames per second, whereas, video for “60 Hz” areas — such as the US
and Japan — is often encoded at 29.97 frames per second. Blu-ray players sold outside of 50
Hz countries are not required to decode 25 fps video or 720×576 video. Blu-ray also sup-
ports a film-friendly rate of 24 frames per second but, in many cases, the alternative 23.976
rate is used in source that was intended for conversion to NTSC video. These peculiar frame
rates are a relic of interlaced television that has carried over to HD. Luckily, more and more
digital televisions are designed to handle all four frame rates.
As with DVD, Blu-ray includes region codes that can prevent a disc from being played on
players sold in other countries. See Region Playback Control in Chapter 4 for further explana-
tion.
Technically, Blu-ray is not a “standard” in the formal sense. Just like DVD, it is a propri-
etary but open format created by a group of companies motivated by mutual interests and
anticipated profits. Related standards from accredited bodies, such as, MPEG, ITU (H.264),
and SMPTE (VC-1), were adopted for Blu-ray, but the important parts of the format — such
as the application specifications for video, audio and interactivity — are proprietary to the
Blu-ray Disc Association. Blu-ray also includes other proprietary formats, such as Dolby
Digital, DTS and Java. Most of the standards and formats used in Blu-ray are subject to
patent royalties from various companies or licensing entities (see Chapter 4).
Myth: “1080p Video Is Twice the Resolution of 1080i”
In a very theoretical sense, in the extreme worst case, this can be true. However, it is like
saying, “You're in danger of being killed by the Sun going nova.” This is technically true, but
the chances are astronomical (sorry, couldn't resist). It is accurate, in general, to state that
progressive video usually has more spatial resolution than interlaced video, since objects that
move between fields are captured with only half the total number of scan lines, but progres-
sive video often has less temporal resolution at the same frame rate because the picture is
updated half as often. (See Chapter 2, Technology Primer, for more on interlaced vs. progres-
sive scanning.)
Most attitudes toward interlaced video come from the days when the dominant display

5DVD has two different primary resolutions — 720×480 for 525/60 (NTSC) television and 720×576 for 625/50

technology was interlaced television. Those days are fading away. Most Blu-ray players are
connected to widescreen displays or projectors that are inherently progressive. They are
unable to display an interlaced video signal without first deinterlacing it. Therefore, issues of
interlaced video resolution, nowadays, are almost all related to deinterlacing, not to inter-
laced display. There are many approaches to deinterlacing, and some work better than oth-
ers.6 On the other hand, progressive source video, such as film, can be stored in 1080i for-
mat. A good deinterlacing processor will recognize progressive source and put it back togeth-
er with no loss of resolution. In this case there is no difference between 1080i and 1080p.
“Progressive is better than interlaced”, is a good rule of thumb. It is true that a motion pic-
ture encoded at 1080p will look better than a home video shot at 1080i on an HD camcorder.
But it is going too far — and ignoring too many complex factors — to say that progressive is
two times better.
Myth: “All Blu-ray Titles Are (or Must Be) Encoded in 1080p”
Blu-ray video can be encoded at many resolutions — high-definition 1080p, 1080i, or 720p,
and lower definition 576p, 576i, 480p, and 480i. In fact, many 1080p features are accompa-
nied by documentaries, camcorder footage, old TV shows, and other content that is only
available in standard definition (which could be upscaled and encoded at 1080p, but it usu-
ally is not worth the bother). Blu-ray is actually a great vehicle for standard-definition video,
since a BD-50 can hold over 20 hours.
Myth: “Blu-ray Players Only Output 1080i Video”
This was true for a few early players, but almost all modern Blu-ray players output a full
1080p video signal. An HDMI connection is required for protected content that does not
allow 1080p output over analog component video connections. Even when the video is
encoded on the disc in 1080i, some players deinterlace it and output 1080p.
Myth: “Blu-ray Does Not Support Mandatory Managed Copy”
Managed copy is a feature of AACS. (See Chapter 3 for basics and Chapter 4 for details.)
Managed copy is mandatory in the sense that every Blu-ray disc protected with AACS must
allow at least one authorized copy (with a few exceptions). However, it is not mandatory that
Blu-ray playback devices provide the managed copy feature. Very few Blu-ray players will
implement it, although it will be popular on computers.
When this book was written, at the end of 2008, Blu-ray actually did not yet support AACS
managed copy. AACS was released in 2006 under an interim license. Managed copy was only
provided in the final license, which was not expected to be issued until 2009.

interfield approaches, such as, vertical-temporal interpolation, motion-adaptive deinterlacing, and motion-com-
pensated deinterlacing, produce better results but are still subject to artifacts and can never fully preserve all
the detail of an interlaced capture.

Myth: “Managed Copy Means Every Blu-ray Disc Can Be
Copied for Free”
Managed copy does require that almost all Blu-ray discs be copyable, at least, once.
However, the copy must be authorized by the content owner, which is free to charge what-
ever it wishes or to require any transaction it wishes before the copy can be made. Some titles
may be copied for free. Others may require watching an ad, signing up for something, or buy-
ing something else. 
Myth: “BD+ Interferes With Managed Copy”
Because BD+ scrambles the video and audio streams on the disc, some of those guys who
slump in their seats in the back of the classroom and only partly pay attention to the teacher
but still think they know everything have claimed that managed copy is impeded by the BD+
Media Transform process. What these guys would understand, if they were paying attention,
is that the Managed Copy Machine, the component that makes the copy after it has been
authorized, acts like a player — it carries out AACS authentication and decryption along
with BD+ reverse transforms to get proper access to the content before it makes a copy.
Myth: “Region Codes Don’t Apply to Computers”
Regional codes apply to Blu-ray video discs played in BD-ROM drives. Every BD-ROM
player application is set to a region by the software vendor or is automatically set by the first
region-coded disc that it plays. Of course, there are ways around regional restrictions, just as
with DVD players and drives. Regional codes do not apply to computer data on Blu-ray
Discs, only to the HDMV and BD-J video formats, although not to HDMV or BD-J on BD-
R or BD-RE discs.
Myth: “Blu-ray Players Can’t Play CDs or DVDs”
Even though the Blu-ray specification makes no mention of CD or DVD compatibility, vir-
tually all Blu-ray players can play audio CDs and DVD-Video discs. Compatibility with other
CD formats varies. Some Blu-ray players can play Video CDs, and a few can play Super
Video CDs, MP3 CDs, WMA CDs, and DivX DVDs. Of course, Blu-ray players cannot play
CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs (discs containing only computer data).
Some Blu-ray recordable drives are unable to burn recordable CDs or DVDs, but they can
read them. Essentially all Blu-ray computers can play DVDs, audio CDs, Video CDs, and
MP3 CDs.

ray video is better than film. The way Blu-ray stores audio and video in digital form has
advantages, not the least of which is the ability to use compression to extend playing times by
lowering data rates. The quality and flexibility of Blu-ray stands out when compared with
similar analog products. It is a mistake, however, to make the generalization that anything
digital is automatically superior to anything analog.
Myth: “Blu-ray Video Is Poor Because It Is Compressed”
You will inevitably hear about “digital artifacts” that plague Blu-ray video. While it is true
that digital video can appear blocky or fuzzy, a well-encoded Blu-ray disc will exhibit few or
no discernible artifacts on a properly calibrated display. The term artifact refers to anything
that was not in the original picture. Artifacts can come from film damage, film-to-video con-
version, analog-to-digital conversion, noise reduction, digital enhancement, digital encoding,
digital decoding, digital-to-analog conversion, signal crosstalk, connector problems, imped-
ance mismatch, electrical interference, waveform aliasing, signal filters, television picture
controls, video scaling in flat-screen displays, and much more. Many people blame all kinds
of image deficiencies on the digital video encoding process. Occasionally, this blame is placed
accurately, but usually it is not. Only those with training or experience can tell for certain the
origin of a particular artifact. If an artifact cannot be duplicated in repeated playings of the
same sequence from more than one copy of a disc, then it is clearly not a result of video
encoding. Here are a few of the most common artifacts — 
j Blocks are small squares in the video. These may be especially noticeable in fast
moving, highly detailed sequences or video with high contrast between light and
dark. This artifact appears when not enough bits are allocated for storing block
detail.
j Halos or ringing are small areas of distortion or dots around moving objects or
high-contrast edges. This is called the Gibbs effect and is also known as mosqui-
toes, or mosquito wings. This is an artifact of video encoding but is easy to con-
fuse with edge enhancement. 
j Edge enhancement is a digital picture-sharpening process that is frequently over-
done, causing a “chiseled” look or a ringing effect like halos around streetlights
at night. Edge enhancement happens before encoding.
j Posterization or banding manifests as bands of colors or shading in what should
be a smooth gradation. This can come from video pre-processing (as when con-
verting from 10-bit to 8-bit video), the video encoding process, or the digital-to-
analog conversion process in the player. It also can happen on a computer when
the number of video colors set for the display is too low.
j Aliasing refers to angled lines that have “stair steps” in them. This artifact is usu-
ally caused by detail that is too sharp or too contrasty to be properly represent-
ed in video, or by poor scaling in the display.
j Noise and snow refer to the gray or white spots scattered randomly throughout
the picture, or graininess. This may come from film grain or low-quality source
video.

j Blurriness refers to low detail and fuzziness of video. This results from low-qual-
ity source video or too much filtering of the video before encoding.
j Worms or crawlies are squirming lines and crawling dots. Usually this results
from low-quality source video or bad digitizing. This also may be the result of
electrical interference. 
All this said, the number one cause of bad video is a poorly adjusted display! The high
fidelity of Blu-ray video demands much more from the display. Turning up the sharpness con-
trol was the standard operating procedure when viewing fuzzy analog video, but this artifi-
cally enhances edges, which makes hidden compression artifacts in digital video stand out
and actually makes the picture look worse. Lower the sharpness value and turn the bright-
ness down, and you will be surprised at the improvement these simple adjustments may

Myth: “Video Compression Does Not Work for Animation” 
It is often claimed that animation, especially hand-drawn cell animation such as cartoons
and Japanese anime, does not compress well. Others claim that animation is so simple that
it compresses better. Neither is generally true.
Supposedly, jitter between frames caused by differences in the drawings or in their align-
ment causes problems. Modern animation techniques produce very exact alignment, so usu-
ally no variation occurs between object positions from frame to frame unless it is an inten-
tional effect. And of course, computer-generated animation has no misalignment between
frames. Even when objects change position between frames, the motion estimation feature
of the encoder can easily compensate. That said, encoders are typically optimized for live
action and may have trouble with animated content.
Because of the way Blu-ray video is compressed, it may have difficulty with the sharp edges
common in animation. This loss of high-frequency information can show up as ringing or
blurry spots along high-contrast edges. However, at the data rates commonly used for Blu-
ray, this problem normally does not occur. The complexity of sharp edges tends to be bal-
anced out by the simplicity of broad areas of single colors. As with DVD, some of the Blu-
ray Discs with the most gorgeous pictures are from animated features.
Myth: “Discs Are Too Fragile to Be Rented” 
This myth was pretty well demolished by Netflix, which not only rents DVDs and Blu-ray
Discs but has the audacity to send them through the US Postal Service, one of the most
destructive forces known to modern civilization.
Discs are, of course, vulnerable to scratches, cracks, accumulation of dirt, and fingerprints.
But these occur at the surface of the disc where they are out of focus to the laser. Damage
and imperfections may cause minor channel data errors that are easily corrected. A common
misperception is that a scratch will be worse on a Blu-ray Disc than on a CD or a DVD
because of higher areal density and because the audio and video are more compressed. Blu-

ray data density is about five times that of DVD, and about 65 times that of CD-ROM, so it
is true that a scratch will affect more data. But Blu-ray error correction is more effective than
DVD and CD error correction. This improved reliability makes up for the density increase.
More importantly, Blu-ray discs include a special hardcoat that makes them much less sus-
ceptible to scratches and other surface damage. However, major scratches on a disc may
cause uncorrectable errors that will cause a read error on a computer or show up as a
momentary glitch in the picture from a player.
DVDs and CDs are likewise subject to scratches, but many rental stores and libraries offer
them. Manufacturers are fond of taking a disc, rubbing it vigorously with sandpaper, and
then placing it in a player, where it plays perfectly. Disc cleaning/polishing products can
repair minor damage. Commercial polishing machines can restore a disc to pristine condi-
tion after an amazing amount of abuse.
Myth: “Dolby Digital or DTS Means 5.1 Channels”
Do not assume that the “Dolby Digital” or the “DTS” label is a guarantee of 5.1 channels
(or 6.1 channels or 7.1 channels) of digital audio. These audio encoding formats can carry
anywhere from one to eight discrete channels, so a Dolby Digital or a DTS soundtrack may
be mono, stereo, Dolby Surround stereo, and so on.7
Most movies produced before 1980 had a monophonic soundtrack. When these movies are
put on Blu-ray, unless a new soundtrack is mixed, the original soundtrack is encoded into a
single channel of digital audio, usually the center channel.
In some cases, more than one Dolby Digital version of a soundtrack is available: a 5.1
channel track and a track specially remixed for two-channel Dolby Surround. It’s normal for
a player to indicate playback of a Dolby Digital audio track while the connected receiver indi-
cates Dolby Surround. This means that the disc contains a two-channel Dolby Surround sig-
nal encoded in Dolby Digital format.
Myth: “The Audio Level from Blu-ray Players Is Too Low” 
People complain that the audio level from Blu-ray and DVD players is too low. In truth,
the audio level on everything else is too high! Movie soundtracks are extremely dynamic,
ranging from near silence to intense explosions. In order to support an increased dynamic
range and to hit peaks (near the 2V RMS limit) without distortion, average sound volume
must be lower. This is why the line level from Blu-ray and DVD players is lower than from
many other sources. The volume level among Blu-ray discs varies, but it is more consistent
than on CDs or from MP3 files. If the change in volume when switching between Blu-ray and
other audio sources is annoying, check the equipment to see if you are able to adjust the out-
put signal level on the player or the input signal level on the receiver.

7Yes, it is quite possible to encode Dolby Surround audio into a 2-channel DTS track, since it is a matrixing
technique that is independent of the digital encoding process.

Myth: “Downmixed Audio Is Not Good Because the LFE
Channel Is Omitted”
The low-frequency effects (LFE, or “subwoofer”) channel is omitted for a good reason as
multi-channel soundtracks are mixed down to two channels in the player. The LFE channel
is intended only for extra bass boost, as the other channels carry full-range bass. Audio sys-
tems without Dolby Digital or DTS capabilities generally do not have speakers that can prop-
erly reproduce very low frequencies, so the designers of the audio coding technologies chose
to have the decoders throw out the LFE track to avoid muddying the sound on an average
home system. Anyone who truly cares about the LFE channel should invest in a receiver with
bass management and a separate subwoofer output.
Myth: “Blu-ray Lets You Watch Movies as They Were Meant to
Be Seen”
This may refer to Blu-ray video’s 1.78 widescreen aspect ratio, which is close to the most
common movie aspect ratio (1.85). However, many movies have a wider aspect than
widescreen TVs, such as 2.35. Thus, even though they look much better on a widescreen TV,
they still have to be formatted to fit the less oblong shape, usually with black bars at the top
and bottom. See Aspect Ratios in Chapter 2 for more information.
Myths: “Java and JavaScript™Are the Same Thing” 
Java is an island in Indonesia, south of Borneo, as well as the name of an object-oriented
programming language primarily used for network applications and applets. Programs writ-
ten in Java do not rely on a specific operating system, so they are platform independent. The
BD-J application format for Blu-ray is an implementation of Java. BD-J applications are spe-
cific to BD-J players but, if properly written, can be readily adapted to run on other GEM-
based platforms.
JavaScript is an unfortunately confusing name given to a dynamic scripting language.
JavaScript initially was used to expand the flexibility, look and style of HTML pages on web-
sites and in browser windows. It was formalized as ECMAScript and later adopted for use
with HD DVD.
The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems, while JavaScript was
parented by Netscape. Reportedly, Netscape was allowed to co-opt Java and create the word
JavaScript as part of a deal with Sun in exchange for providing support of Java applets. Sun
has regretted the confusion and misbranding ever since.

What’s Wrong with
Blu-ray Disc™
“Problems are the price you pay for progress.”
— Branch Rickey1
“Progress might have been all right once, but it has gone on too long.”
— Ogden Nash2
In 2002, following the success of DVD, which proved to be the fastest growing consumer
media of all time, the DVD Forum started talks to create a new medium that would meet the
needs of consumers for the next 10 to 25 years. Almost at the same time, a second group,
composed of many of the same companies as in the DVD Forum, began separate discussions
with the same goal. Although the design objectives and the user requirements were similar,
the primary differences between the rival groups came down to who controlled the intellec-
tual property rights of the to-be-created technology and could a group member get a better
deal by promoting one solution over the other. The efforts by the groups devolved and result-
ed in the competing high definition optical disc formats — HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The
leading proponent of HD DVD was Toshiba, while Sony, Philip and, later, Panasonic led the
Blu-ray effort.
In the Spring of 2006, the two next-generation disc formats were introduced to consumers.
Playing on the base human nature attributes of greed and ego, neither group was willing to
back down or to compromise on a unified format. In fact, the format war was introduced in
March, 2006 with such statements as this one from Kazuhiro Tsuga, an executive at
Panasonic, during an interview with Reuters, “We are not talking and we will not talk, the
market will decide the winner.” Giving a hint to the ultimate fate of HD DVD, in June, 2006,
Reuters quoted Toshiba's president Atsutoshi Nishida, during the company's annual share-
holders' meeting in Tokyo, as saying, "We have not given up on a unified format. We would
like to seek ways for unifying the standards if opportunities arise."
Although the market conflict lasted far longer than was good for any party, the end of the
war came far quicker than anyone had expected. In early January 2008, Warner Bros.
Company, with about 20% of the DVD market, decided to exclusively support Blu-ray after
having straddled the fence by offering titles in both next generation formats. This was fol-
lowed in February with the leading retailers Best Buy, Walmart, Blockbuster, and Netflix,
joined by the Paramount and Universal studios, saying they would only support Blu-ray.

Toshiba threw in the towel on February 19, 2008, announcing that  it would, “...no longer
develop, manufacture and market HD DVD players and recorders.” HD DVD “lost” the war
and Blu-ray was the victor. Among the costs of the war was the prolonged delay where con-
sumers did not even consider either new HD disc format, while the battle raged.
Even though Blu-ray has won, it is far from perfect (nor, for that matter, was HD DVD).
This chapter presents some of the shortcomings of this latest retooling in optical disc tech-
nology.
Copy Protection
A 2005 study by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) claims that pirated
DVDs were costing the movie industry over $6.1 billion per year. For Blu-ray to succeed,
some method of content protection more effective than the thoroughly compromised CSS
(Content Scrambling System, used for DVDs) was needed.
Advanced Access Content System
The industry, along with DVD Forum members and Blu-ray Disc Association members,
came up with the Advanced Access Content System (AACS). Yet, within six months of the
first shipments of HD DVD and Blu-ray titles, a hacker posted software to decrypt the AACS
scheme, allowing one to unlock disc content and to make copies or post to the Internet, albeit
only for the hacked disc. Technically, this hack took advantage of some poorly implemented
naming schemes by the disc producer, but the scheme had been hacked. So much for a secure
system.
One of the features of AACS, unlike CSS, is that specific keys used to lock and unlock con-
tent can be revoked and new keys can be issued. This has created a cat and mouse game
between the studios and the hackers, and it gives the studios some level of confidence that
their titles cannot be easily and widely copied.
Movie studios and consumer electronics companies promoted legislation to make it illegal
to defeat DVD content protection. Their efforts helped bring about the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty (December, 1996), the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty (December, 1996), and the compliant Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA), passed into US law October, 1998. Software or devices intended specifically
and primarily to circumvent content protection are now illegal in the United States and many
other countries. A co-chair of the legal group of the content protection committee stated, “In
the video context, the contemplated legislation should also provide some specific assurances
that certain reasonable and customary home recording practices will be permitted, in addi-
tion to providing penalties for circumvention.” Blu-ray with AACS has made this sort of
copying, even single copies for personal use, very difficult and, if replicators and player man-
ufactures follow the Blu-ray specification, all but impossible.
Unlike DVD, where all content protection systems are optional for DVD publishers, Blu-
ray requires that all replicated discs use AACS. The added production complexity and the
licensing costs, currently over a thousand dollars in various fees, have restricted the release
What’s Wrong with Blu-ray Disc

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

of titles to mainly those from the top studios. As with DVD, we may see players that more
loosely interpret the specifications and will play unprotected movies from replicated discs.
Although, most players will play HDMV and BD-J programmed content on BD-R/RE.
Blu-ray Disc Plus (BD+)
The Blu-ray camp expected that eventually (maybe not so soon, though) such a breach of
the AACS security and added another layer of protection called BD+ (BD Plus). Unlike
AACS, BD+ allows content producers to change the copy protection scheme from disc to
disc. So, if a hacker breaks one disc, they have just broken one disc and not all discs. The evi-
dent success of BD+ has been borne out by postings on various forums on the web, that the
hackers have only broken discs one at a time. The level of sophistication has made copying
discs a serious game. BD+ does what the content owners and format developers wanted it to
do and it does not interfere with the user experience, but it does make it very difficult for
endusers to make backup copies of their purchases.
Image Constraint Token
Image Constraint Token (ICT) is a feature that lets a content owner restrict the resolution
of disc playback on non-secure signal paths. If the High-bandwidth Digital Content
Protection (HDCP) path is not used to connect a player to a display, for example, a DVI
(Digital Visual Interface) connection without HDCP, then the signal resolution will be down-
converted by the player to that of standard definition DVD resolution (720×480). This also
means that if you set up your monitor and your Blu-ray player using component cables, which
works on some discs and looks great, the discs that use ICT will be downconverted and will
look terrible. For the consumer, this can be very confusing. Also, this means that playback on
a computer without a secure HDCP path will either be in 720×480 resolution or may not
play at all.
Watermarking
Another copy protection gotcha is what can be called the birthday scenario. This relates to
watermarking (which is a part of AACS). Hypothetically, let’s say you are filming your child’s
birthday party, and a movie is playing on a TV set in the background. If the audio is water-
marked (or if there is a video watermark and you get the TV in the frame) then it could be
possible, after you have transferred your home video to disc and are playing it in a player with
watermark detection, for your kid’s birthday party to be mistakenly identified as pirated con-
tent. Watermarking systems are supposedly designed to prevent this from happening, but it
is an interesting illustration of how complicated the balance is between protecting content
owner rights while not impinging on the freedom of consumers.
Region Playback Control
The purpose of region playback control is to allow studios to control the release of their
movies in the different markets of the world. The problem this creates for the consumer is
that if you buy a disc while traveling in one region and you live in another region, you can-
What’s Wrong with Blu-ray Disc
9
9 - 3
Blu-ray Disc Demystified

not use the disc if you purchased a player in your home region. That is similar to buying a
book in London and finding that the pages are stuck closed and you cannot open it when you
return home to San Francisco.
As opposed to the six regions in use for DVD releases, Blu-ray makes this a bit easier by
dividing the world into three regions, A, B, and C . The only upside of RPC (Regional
Playback Control) is that the studios do not have to use this feature and on many of the early
discs, RPC was not used. One of the differences between DVD and Blu-ray, is that the RPC
is handled by the application layer (with the HDMV or BD-J programming) instead of
between the player and the disc. The player can be queried by the Blu-ray title and the pro-
gramming can be made to display something more appealing than “Wrong Region”. For
example, the disc could display a pretty graphic announcing — “This disc was sold for the “A”
market. If you wish to play this movie title in this player, you can purchase a copy at your
favorite retailer.” Or, perhaps, an even more advanced announcement — “This disc was pur-
chased for playback in another region, if you wish to play this disc in this player, please click
here, enter your credit card number and for a small fee we will let you play this title on this
player”. The latter example assumes that your Blu-ray player is connected to the Internet.
Hollywood Baggage on Computers
As more computers gain the ability to play movies from Blu-ray, the region playback con-
trol and content protection requirements need to be implemented in computers as well as
home players. Manufacturers of hardware or software involved in the playback of encrypted
movies are required to obtain a license from the AACS Licensing Authority (AACS LA).
The manufacturers must ensure that decrypted files cannot be copied, that digital outputs
contain proper content protection information, and that analog outputs are also protected.
The upside is that these safeguards assure Hollywood that its property will not be plun-
dered and spread illegally from computer to computer. The downside is that most law-abid-
ing computer owners are inconvenienced and may pay slightly more because of these pro-
tection measures. This is especially irritating to those who have no interest in watching com-
mercial movies on their computer screens.
NTSC versus PAL is also 60 Hertz versus 50 Hertz
If you are a content producer you still have to worry about NTSC versus PAL for standard
definition video and, now, will also have to worry about 60 Hertz (Hz) versus 50 Hertz for
high definition content. In addition, you will have to chose whether to produce your content
at 1280×720 resolution (progressive) and risk that some displays will automatically down-
scale to 720×480 because that’s the only resolution they have that supports your frame rate.
Or, you’ll consider going with 1920×1080 progressive resolution and run the risk that the
display either has to interlace the video or scale to a lower resolution, or both, because the
display is not capable of showing 1920×1080 progressive video.
In standard definition DVD terms, we have NTSC countries — 60 hertz (Hz) power, 30
frames per second (fps) sized at 720×480 pixels, and PAL countries — 50 hertz power, 25

frames per second at 720×576 pixels. What this means is that you could have discs that
would not play because you did not have the right player or the right display. With Blu-ray,
one might have hoped that this condition would have been remedied. Well, to a degree it has.
With DVD, a player did not have to support both 25 (24.97) fps and 30 fps (29.97). In prac-
tice, though, almost all players in PAL standard countries supported NTSC discs.
For Blu-ray, all players must support 23.976/24 hz, 29.97/30 hz and 59.94/60 hz. Optionally,
players in 50 hz countries may also support 24.97/25 hz. This means that a disc can be creat-
ed for all regions unless the video is specifically targeted for the 24.97/25 hz markets.
It remains to be seen if new HD material will be created in a format that is compatible for
all regions (of the world and the universe). The bottomline is that endusers should not have
to sort out these arcane technical nuances of video.
Connection Incompatibilities
HDMI is the newest interconnect format and it is most promising. With one cable carry-
ing all of the signals it definitely makes the cable clutter behind audio and video components
much less of a mess. Alas, even though the standard has evolved from versions 1.1 to 1.2 to
1.3, getting all of the components to talk with one another is not troublefree. The connection
handshake between a player and a receiver and a monitor, when successful, can take around
four seconds. But, there is a lot that can go wrong. The monitor may not support the video
resolution that the player is outputting, for example, 720p vs 1080p. In that case the monitor
may not display anything. Getting the monitor to display a picture again can become very
tricky. For example, on the Sony PlayStation3 (PS3), you would hold the front panel power
on button for ten seconds while turning the back panel on/off switch to “on”. At one point,
eBay listings for Sony PS3s not working because of “no display” were very plentiful.
Some players, with some firmware revisions, will stop playing the disc whenever the HDMI
display connection is removed. For example, if you are checking the latest score of a ballgame
from your satellite or cable settop box, the disc may have to go through the lengthy loading
process to get back to the movie. Getting the player to sync up with the monitor can be very
frustrating. Keep a note on your player explaining how to reset the player and monitor to a
compatible display setting so that when they go out of sync you can get everything working
again. Also, because of audio copy protection concerns, if the disc has a feature which uses
audio mixing (e.g., button sounds with high definition DTS or Dolby Digitial audio), the but-
ton sounds will not be heard when using HDMI audio. Bizzare, huh? It may leave one long-
ing for the clutter and simplicity of the old fashioned RCA connectors and cables that offer
the refreshing option of plug it in and see it and hear it.
Playback Incompatibilities
There are two programming modes for Blu-ray — HDMV and BD-J. Generally, there
tends to be fewer incompatibility issues with HDMV playback than with BD-J, mainly
because the BD-J environment has many more options and is based on a wide array of spec-
ifications.
What’s Wrong with Blu-ray Disc

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

With BD-J, the chance for misinterpretation and differences in interpretation, are great.
Also, there are many different ways to accomplish the same thing in BD-J. At the core of
BD-J is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Some manufacturers have licensed the JVM code
from Sun Microsystems. Others have decided to implement their own version of JVM. This
is reminiscent of the days when you had MS-DOS and DR-DOS and PC-DOS. Often, pro-
grams would work as expected on one platform but not on others. Within the BD-J specifi-
cation, there are several libraries or packages that do virtually the same function. Some of
the early players did not implement all libraries properly, but the manufacturers are working
diligently with the BDA to improve testing routines to remedy these situations.
To address these differences, the studios and the authoring houses in Hollywood have
taken a couple of approaches. One approach is take no prisoners, program to the specifica-
tions and if the players don't work, let the manufacturers fix their players. If the manufac-
turers don't update their players to conform, the consumers will help evolve the survival of
the fittest. Or, the other approach is to program to the lowest common denominator.
However, this is difficult to achieve because if just one manufacturer's implementation dif-
fers then you don't use that feature. Some of the incompatibilities may be  frustrating to the
user in that they could see poorly drawn graphics, and poor or non-functioning features, such
as, network capability.
As if the inherent challenges in making a player conform to the specifications weren’t
enough, the BDA has specified five different profile levels of players —
Profile 1, version 1.0, players introduced before November 1, 2007,
Profile 1, version 1.1. players introduced after October 31, 2007,
Profile 2 (optional),
Profile 3 (optional audio-only player), and
Profile 4 (realtime recording and editing).
What this means is that depending on when the player you bought was introduced to the
market, the latest Blu-ray disc that you have bought may not fully work. For example, Bonus
View, a marketing name for Profile1, version 1.1 players, includes the features PiP, secondary
audio, local storage, and luma value, but these features are not available on any of the early
players except the Sony PS3. Also, the network connected feature, called BD-Live, requires
a player that conforms to the optional Profile 2.
Compatibility is a challenge to all involved whether it is the player manufacturers trying to
make their players do all of the cool things in the specifications, or the studios trying to
decide which features to put on the discs at the risk of disappointing some of their endusers,
or the authoring houses trying to figure out how to implement the feature in such a way that
it works on all of, or even just the majority of, the players, or the consumer trying to buy and
use the “right” cheapest player.
As was the case for DVD, expect that BD players will continue to have special anomalies
for years to come. The difference with Blu-ray players vs DVD players is that all of the Blu-
ray players can be updated with firmware updates, either by inserting an update disc or by
direct network connection to the player. Note that the ability to upgrade the firmware does
not help the limitations of the hardware configuration made by a given manufacturer. For
What’s Wrong with Blu-ray Disc

example, a player with no Ethernet port can never be upgraded to Profile 2. Most manufac-
turers are updating their players on a regular basis so the consumer will have to check often
for updates. Fortunately, most discs that push the limits of the specification capabilities come
with a reminder note in each disc saying, “check your player manufacturer’s website for the
latest update.”
Poor Performance
The BD specifications, for the most part, do not require any minimum performance for
the players and the minimum hardware is described as a 300 Mhz RISC based processor.
This level of processor has a speed rating of about 2 Megaflops (two million floating point
operations per second). But, Sony introduced the PS3, which plays Blu-ray discs in addition
to playing games, and gave it a processor that has an overall speed rating of 2.18 Teraflops3.
This difference, in the extreme case, means that the PS3 is 6,000 times faster than the mini-
mum player hardware requirement. Put another way, the PS3 can perform a set of operations
in one second that would take a minimum hardware system 6,000 seconds (100 minutes).
Floating point operations is only one metric, and probably not the best metric, for an overall
comparison of performance. Other performance metrics could include integer operations,
class-loading time, image decoding, drawing, font rendering, and so on.
In actual cases, the true disparity is less than this, and a PS3 user may see a popup menu
of 24 frame animation look very smooth and take one second, while on a minimum hardware
compliant player the animation may take more than 7 to 8 seconds. The result, however, is
that the animation just doesn't have the same cool look. Also, on a PS3 it might take 7 to 10
seconds to get to the opening credits of a movie, but it might take up to 3 to 5 minutes on
some of the settop players. The manufacturers that use the minimum required specifications
as their target have been overwhelmingly outclassed by the PS3. The PS3 has, as of 2008, as
much as 75% of the market of Blu-ray players. Over time, the performance gap may be
closed but, for the early adopters, the PS3 was the way to go.
Feeble Support of Parental Choice Features
Hollywood included a parental management feature for DVD but was very slow to actu-
ally use it. And, although present for Blu-ray, it is yet to be seen if Hollywood will use the
feature for Blu-ray.
One approach by some clever entrepreneurs from Utah was to create a DVD player that
allowed for specially-filtered movies. But it required an act of the US Congress to make it
legal. The Family Movie Act is part of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005.
Legislators have explicitly allowed systems that change DVD playback, as an alternative to

the absence of multi-ratings feature on the disc itself. This allows special playback devices
that filter content for objectional material by either skipping or muting the material. For
DVD, this required special players. For Blu-ray, this is, on one hand, easier and, on the other
hand, more difficult to implement.
Technically, an enduser could create a custom playlist that skips objectional material, but
not all titles support creating custom playlists. This feature may become more popular with
movies that take advantage of BD-Live players that allow users to create and share playlists.
It is possible to create an application that provides this filtering, but Blu-ray requires any
additional application (new software code) to be properly signed, in programming parlance.
The intent of this signing process is to prevent unauthorized and, therefore, presumed mali-
cious, applications from taking over a Blu-ray player, just as a virus would with a personal
computer. Unless, these new applications are created and/or approved by the content own-
ers, they cannot be signed correctly and, thus, will not work.
Yet, Blu-ray discs can be designed to play a different version of a movie depending on the
parental level that has been set in the player. By taking advantage of the seamless branching
feature of Blu-ray, objectionable scenes can be skipped automatically or replaced during
playback. This requires that the disc be carefully authored with alternate scenes and branch
points that do not cause interruptions or discontinuities in the soundtrack.
Hollywood remains unconvinced that there is a large enough demand to justify the extra
work involved — shooting extra footage, recording extra audio, editing new sequences, cre-
ating branch points, synchronizing the soundtrack across jumps, submitting new versions for
MPAA rating, dealing with players that do not properly implement parental branching, hav-
ing video store chains refuse to carry discs with unrated content, et cetera. Seamless branch-
ing is being used quite a lot more these days, but for special editions and unrated versions
rather than parental control; this is because it is done with the filmmaker’s complicity, to
extend their vision.
Not Better Enough
In an age when smaller, lower-quality video imagery, such as, iTunes downloads and
YouTube videos, have become more popular and acceptable to consumers because of their
convenience and easy access, the BD format faces an uphill battle, even with its often stun-
ning picture quality. And, many consumers cannot tell the difference between upconverted
DVD images and high definition video. Further, it requires that they have a 1920×1080-
capable display to really appreciate the difference, and those monitors did not come down to
a price that was acceptable to a large portion of the market until late 2007. Additionally,
1080p displays were not readily available at attractive prices — US$1,000 for a 42 inch dis-
play — until mid-2008.
So, if upconverted DVD is good enough and you cannot see the difference anyway, why
do you need Blu-ray? One answer may lay in having compelling content with network inter-
activity that brings out the content on a disc. But, not every Blu-ray player has, or will have,
built-in network connectivity.
The challenge is finding and exploiting the new feature capabilities of BD. In time, people

will have a playback system that allows them to see the difference between DVD and high
definition video. For the present, there is a lot of confusion in consumer's minds about the
difference. Most people are looking for “big” screen TV not high definition TV. Until con-
sumers see the difference, the biggest competitor to Blu-ray is DVD.
Blu-ray is designed for HD displays supporting 1920×1080×24 fps. On these displays, the
difference between upconverted DVD and Blu-ray is clearly visible. If you have a less capa-
ble display, you probably could stick with your old DVD player. To get the best results from
Blu-ray, you really need to invest in a new HD display.
No Reverse Play
Because of the way compressed video builds frames by using the differences from previ-
ous frames, it is difficult to smoothly play in reverse. To accomplish that feat, a playback sys-
tem must have either a very large memory buffer in which to store a set of previous frames
or use a very complex high-speed process of jumping back and forth on the disc to build a
frame sequence based on the nearest key frame. Although RAM for video buffers has got-
ten less expensive, there are only DVD computers and some very high-end DVD players that
have the capacity to play backwards at normal speed.
Some players can play backwards through a disc by skipping between key frames.
Attempting to display these frames at the proper time intervals results in jerky playback with
delays of about 1/2 second between each frame. Smooth scan can only be achieved by show-
ing the frames at 12 to 15 times normal speed, thus speeding up the action.
One of the best techie gag gifts is the DVD rewinder. But, one of the things we love about
VHS tape is that when you put a tape back in the player it would continue from where you
last stopped playing. No copyright notice, no trailers for last season's releases, no cute menu,
no having to advance to the video so that you could resume watching the movie. Because the
next generation players have memory, it is possible for content authors to create a resume
function so that you can have a VHS experience. Progress? Maybe not.
Only Two Aspect Ratios
As with DVD, Blu-ray disc is limited to the two aspect ratios of 1.33 (4:3) and 1.78 (16:9),
even though MPEG-2 allows a third aspect ratio of 2.21. Because of the need for a standard
physical shape, displays essentially come in two shapes — 4:3 and 16:9. With HDTV, the stan-
dard aspect ratio is 16:9 and yet there is all that legacy 4:3 material out there.  So, there are
black bars on either the top/bottom or the sides of the display depending on the original
source aspect.
Better yet would be the ability to support any aspect ratio. If the player or TV were able
to unsqueeze an anamorphic source of any ratio, it would provide better resolution because
pixels would not be wasted on the letterbox mattes. Letterbox mattes may still need to be
generated by the player or the display, but high-resolution displays would be able to make
the most of every pixel of an anamorphic signal. The obvious disadvantage to this feature is

that variable-geometry picture scaling circuitry is more expensive than the fixed-geometry
scaling of DVD players and existing widescreen TVs.
No Barcode Standard
In their day, one of the most powerful features of laserdisc players used in training and in
education was barcodes. Printed barcodes could be scanned using a handheld scanner or
wand that sent commands to the player, telling the player to search to a specific picture or to
play a particular segment. The player became a powerful interactive presentation tool when
combined with a barcode reader. In their time, barcodes were added to textbooks, charts,
posters, lesson outlines, storybooks, workbooks, and much more, enhancing the presentation
material with quick access to pictures and/or movies. So, although Blu-ray players theoreti-
cally can support USB keyboards and, therefore, barcode readers, this feature has not, as yet,
made it into any of the Blu-ray players.
No External Control Standard
Most consumer laserdisc players included an external control connector, and all industri-
al laserdisc players included a serial port for connection to a computer. An entire genre of
multimedia systems evolved during the 1980s using laserdisc players to add sound and video
to computer software. Reaching back more than 20 years may be a real stretch and, admit-
tedly, this is less important today as the multimedia features of computers improve, but many
applications of optical discs, such as, video editing, kiosks, and custom installations are lim-
ited by the lack of an external control standard. Each player manufacturer uses a different
proprietary command protocol.
Poor Computer Compatibility
Early compatibility problems plagued the previous generations of optical media. The CD-
ROM industry was long plagued by incompatibility problems with return rates in 1995 as
high as 40 percent. Compatibility problems were caused by incorrect hardware or software
setups, defects in video and audio hardware, bugs in video and audio driver software, and
hardware that was not powerful enough for the envisioned tasks.
And, the problems with DVD-ROM were even worse. DVD-ROMs have to deal with
defects in video and audio decoder hardware or software, incompatibilities of proprietary
playback implementations, decoder software that could not keep up with full-rate movies,
DVD-Video navigation software that did not correctly emulate a DVD-Video player, and so
on. In the early days, some computers with a DVD-ROM drive would not play movies from
a DVD-Video disc, especially computers that were upgraded from a CD-ROM to a DVD-
ROM drive.
Now, getting a Blu-ray disc to play on a computer has been an issue on all except the lat-

est, fastest, most powerful computers that were designed with all of the requirements for Blu-
ray built-in. Simply adding a Blu-ray drive to an existing, even high-end computer, does not
ensure successful results. The video decoding demands often require an upgrade of the video
card which may also require a new motherboard. Support for navigating a Blu-ray disc using
a computer mouse is often turned off, by default, by some software players. In time, as more
computers are built around the Blu-ray system requirements this may be a much more satis-
fying experience. Upgrading an existing computer system by adding a Blu-ray drive is not rec-
ommended. You are better off with a new system that has been designed and built for the
task. One must realize that Blu-ray is a great leap forward, so it is unfair to demand that your
old 90 MHz Pentium PC be able to play a BD.
Limited Web Standard
One of the most exciting possibilities for Blu-ray is the ability to connect to the Internet
with a Profile 2 enabled player. Hollywood studios, corporations, educators, and other Blu-
ray creators are exploring the potential applications achievable when combining the contents
of a Blu-ray Disc with the best of the Internet.
Unfortunately, the Blu-ray specification only defines the TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS
protocols and does not define any higher transaction level standards. There is no web brows-
er defined in the specification. With a Java program use of TCP and UDP, a Blu-ray Disc is
perfectly able to implement higher transaction level standards, e.g., a p2p, download, online
sale, chat, or mail protocol. Of course, the burden is on the author/programmer to choose
the transaction standard(s) to implement and how. So, Web browsing is something the Blu-
ray author has to create. The possibility for player and title incompatibility is high. This lack
of standardization may make the incompatabilities of the browser wars — when web pro-
ducers were seriously constrained by lack of reliable design standards — look tame and sim-
ple, in retrospect. On the other hand, the browser in Blu-ray is not burned into the player
but, instead, can be included on the disc, or even replaced with a new one with a simple net-
work update. For this reason, compatibility problems may be less, particularly for an appli-
cation used as a portal to content controlled by the studio.
Too Many Encoding Formats
Beyond the variety of video formats that have to be supported looms a variety of video
codecs — MPEG-2, VC-1, or AVC. It is not too bad for those producing discs because they
can pick one and stick with it, but for those making players — either hardware consumer
devices or software for PCs — have to implement, test, and pay royalties for the different
video decoders.
New audio codecs have been added as well, including a new version of Dolby Digital, a
new version of DTS, a renamed version of MLP, a lossless variation of DTS, plus a set of
optional audio codecs for secondary audio streams — DD+ and DTS-HD LBR (low

bitrate), aka DTS Express. While it is good to have choices, and the inclusion of lossless
audio is more preferable to an incompatible second format such as DVD-Audio, the end
result is that players and authoring tools are more complicated and more expensive.
Too Many Inputs
Even before serious work began on the new disc formats, the seeds were sown for new
problems. In the period of time that has transpired since the introduction of HD television
sets, a multitude of new video input types have also been created. In addition to the 75-ohm
VHF RF-carrier (RF), composite, S-video (Y/C), and component (Y’PbPr) connectors
defined for standard defintion video, HD television sets now may incorporate HD analog
component (also Y’PbPr), DVI (including DVI-A and DVI-D), and HDMI, among others.
Due to content protection issues, it is possible that HD displays previously sold as “HD
Ready” (no HD tuner but with DVI or HDMI and, maybe, component video inputs at less
than 1080p resolution), or “HD Compatible” (HDMI capability but with lower than HD-
ready resolution), may display 1080p video at a degraded, less than pixel for pixel resolution.
Consumers will have to educate themselves about these issues in order to get what they have
paid for from their displays.
Too Many Channels
What about audio? The Blu-ray specification supports high-bandwidth multichannel loss-
less audio compression, giving the ability to deliver up to eight channels of pristine audio
ecstasy. However, it is still not clear how all these channels will get to your speakers. Most
current A/V receivers support S/PDIF or Toslink digital connections, which have enough
bandwidth to deliver two channels of uncompressed PCM audio data or 5.1 channels of
Dolby Digital or DTS-encoded audio data. In order to carry eight channels of uncompressed
PCM audio, you would need four S/PDIF or Toslink connections all working together.
All versions of HDMI have the ability to deliver eight channels of uncompressed PCM
audio to an A/V receiver. But, if you want to use HDMI for a bitstream output of the other
lossless audio codecs (DTS-HD MA and TrueHD), you need to update your receiver to
HDMI version 1.3.  Versions 1.0 to 1.2 do not have the bandwidth to support the higher
bitrates of these advanced codecs. Another approach could be to fall back to using eight ana-
log RCA phono plugs. Alternatively, the audio data can be delivered encoded, though it still
requires more bandwidth than most receivers currently support, as well as requiring built-in
support for DTS-HD and/or Dolby TrueHD decoding.
Once you have decided on a viable solution (or two) for how to get the audio data to your
receiver, there is still the question of where to send it from there. In other words, where are
those eight speakers? There is no specific standard for 7.1 speaker placement. In some con-
figurations, the typical 5.1 configuration of Left, Center, Right, Left Surround, Right
What’s Wrong with Blu-ray Disc

9
Blu-ray Disc Demystified

Surround may be augmented with either additional side or center speakers. In other config-
urations, the extra channels are used to provide altitude. Integrating eight-channel audio into
the home environment means making a great number of decisions.
Please note that the companion disc to this book includes a DTS 7.1 piece that strikingly
demonstrates the upside of 7.1 audio. Too bad there are not more uses of 7.1 channels in the-
atrical productions.
Not Enough Interactivity
The new BD format is leaps and bounds beyond old DVD when it comes to interactivity.
BD uses a powerful programming language (Java), multiple planes of video, and sophisti-
cated layout control to provide animated menus that can popup on top of running video,
game-like control of onscreen graphics, hyperlinked content, Internet connectivity, and
much more. However, many limitations have been set and a huge numbers of compromises
have been made during the process of defining these interactive features, most in order to
meet the restrictions of insuring that low-cost consumer devices will be produced. Next-gen-
eration players will do very cool things, but they will most likely still be a far cry from game
consoles and BD-capable computers.
Too Much Interactivity
Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, there is a danger in power. The more complex
and flexible a system is, the higher the probability that something will go wrong. The old
DVD format was simple, yet there were still many cases where discs — sometimes million-
sellers from major studios — would not play properly in some players.
Virtual machines, complex programs, mixed video planes, and other interactive features
multiply the potential for playback problems by a few orders of magnitude. Unless player
manufacturers and content creators are a lot more careful when designing and testing their
wares, a serious backlash could result from consumers perceiving the newfangled format to
be unreliable and finicky.
Conclusion
In some ways, the original DVD format suffered from many of the same problems. It, too,
had too many video formats (NTSC and PAL). Likewise, it supported too many audio codecs.
After all, was it really necessary to require PCM and Dolby Digital and MPEG (for PAL play-
ers) and also have optional support for DTS and SDDS audio? But, in the end, the market
decided which of these capabilities and features were most important, and which could be
ignored. Perhaps we can expect new and creative solutions to the “too many” problems of
Blu-ray, as well.

Chapter 10
Interactivity
DVD was largely responsible for introducing consumers to the idea of a menu on their TV
screen. In the mid-90’s TVs and VCRs had begun to provide on-screen menus for changing
device settings and computers and video games have menus, but the widespread adoption of
DVDs around the turn of the millennium was what familiarized Joe and Jane Couchpotato
to the idea that six little buttons — menu, up, down, left, right, and enter— could provide
interactive, nonlinear access to assorted programs and features on a disc.
Most people look back at the early DVD titles and think how simple they were— a movie,
a few trailers, perhaps a director commentary, a set of subtitles, and some basic menus to
access the disparate elements. Of course, none of this was completely new. Laserdiscs had
provided high quality audio and video, along with secondary audio tracks, such as, commen-
taries, for years before DVD. So what made DVD so successful? More speculation has been
offered on that subject than is worth putting in print, but one point stands out — DVD
offered a new look to and a new feel for content. As simple as the early menus were, and as
basic the features, DVD offered a quantum leap beyond slow, linear videotape machines,
and a level of interactivity that jumped far beyond laserdisc. The fact that upon insertion,
most DVDs immediately display a set of menus that ask a viewer what they would like to see
or hear, coupled with the convenience of no longer needing to rewind the tape, represents a
complete transformation in how people interact with content. While this new interaction par-
adigm was not the only driving force behind DVD’s success, it is certainly important when
distinguishing DVD from previous mainstream video products.
Recreating DVD’s Success
DVD’s star is hitched to entertainment content. The unparalleled growth of DVD into a
$24 billion industry in the U.S. alone was driven by consumer demand for what’s on the discs,
not by interest in the technology itself. That growth began to slow in 2005 as saturation
became a factor — most people who wanted to replace their VCR and videotape collection
had done so but, after its tenth birthday, DVD continued to be a success by almost any mea-
sure. By 2007 more than 80 percent of U.S. households had a DVD player, more than half
had two or more, and the average number of DVDs per household was about 85.
DVD quickly became responsible for the lion’s share of entertainment revenue, account-
ing for more money than box office, network television, cable, and other sources put togeth-
er (see Figure 10.1). As a judge of the 2005 DVD Awards put it, “Hollywood is no longer in
the business of making movies but is now in the business of making DVDs.”

So what happens when customers have bought most of the old movies they are interested
in? Will they buy them over again if the movies are “new and improved?” Hopes have been
pinned to high-definition formats reinvigorating home video sales, largely based on two ele-
ments — high-definition quality and advanced interactivity. Opinions vary on how signifi-
cantly interactivity will contribute to Blu-ray adoption but it is a fundamental part of the for-
mat.
A New Kind of Interactivity
A basic characteristic of DVD interactivity is that everything can be done via menus (mak-
ing audio and subtitle selections, playing the movie, watching bonus features, and so on).
This interaction, however, is generally a modal experience — you are either on a menu or
playing a feature, but not both. You must leave the movie to get to a menu to do something
else with the disc content. This somewhat jarring activity interferes with the continuity of the
experience. Even with stylized, thematic menus the experience can be disruptive. Some
attempts have been made with DVD to improve the menu experience. The InfiniFilm™fea-
ture on some New Line Home Video DVDs, for example, uses the subtitle track to provide
popup menus over the film. The Follow the White Rabbit feature on the original Warner
Bros. The Matrix DVD used a similar technique to provide interactive jump points within the
movie. Other discs followed suit but, in each case, the extra content caused complications
with the format functionality. Having buttons appear over the video required a subpicture
stream. More importantly, it meant that no other subpicture stream (such as subtitles) could
play while the menu feature was active. As a result, if subtitles were needed in addition to the
interactive buttons, much more complex programming and asset preparation was required.

Perhaps the most successful attempts to supersede DVD’s inherent modal experience
came through the use of the format’s multiangle feature. Pioneered by companies like MX
Entertainment and Technicolor in the US and the BBC and The Yard in the UK, titles began
to appear on the market that allowed the viewer to make interactive selections, activating
alternate video and audio material without interrupting playback. Although the feature has
been most often used for concert videos, such as, U2: Live from Boston (2001), Rolling Stones:
Four Flicks, and Rush: Rush in Rio (2003), it debuted on a special edition title produced by
the BBC for their Walking with Beasts television series. Unlike the concert videos, which pri-
marily used the technique by providing an on-screen interface for accessing alternative video
angles, the BBC used the feature to create fully interactive popup menus over video that pro-
vided access to audio stream selection and alternative, synchronized video content. At any
time throughout the 30-minute episode the viewer could switch among four related video
programs. The primary video, an episode of the television series, served as the starting point.
The alternative programs provided specific information related to the main program, for
example, details about the flora of the time or about the creatures being shown. But even this
groundbreaking title was not able to fully overcome the constraints of the DVD format. Due
to the nature of multiangle video, a half-hour program consumes virtually the entire capaci-
ty of a disc. In addition, switching between menus created non-seamless pauses in the video
playback — not as bad as jumping out to a separate menu, but still rather disruptive to the
video program. Nevertheless, these titles paved the way for the next generation of interac-
tivity.
The Seamless User Experience
Dubbing it the seamless user experience, Hollywood studios gravitated toward the conve-
nience of being able to watch a movie and, without interrupting the film (without even a
glitch in the audio or video), use thematic popup menus that provide access to special fea-
tures, audio and subtitle selections, and alternate scenes or camera angles, as well as, to
launch highly interactive applications that may appear to be part of the film itself, such as, a
video game.
Imagine, for example, putting a mystery film into a Blu-ray Disc player. Instead of going
directly to a menu, playback launches directly to the feature film (with requisite logos and
warning cards). During the opening credits, a stylized menu appears in the lower third of the
screen, offering the option of watching just the film or of receiving periodic, interactive
prompts about additional bonus features on the disc. You select the latter option and the
movie continues to play effortlessly. Soon, a prompt appears to let you know that a director’s
commentary starts in ten seconds. Would you like to hear it? As the counter ticks down the
seconds, you activate the option and the director appears in the lower left corner of the
screen superimposed over the movie. When the timer hits zero, the director says hello, intro-
duces himself, and proceeds to tell you about how he made the film, sharing interesting
points and highlighting portions of the screen as the movie plays. Later in the film, an option
appears for selecting a game in which you have to identify “who dunnit.” You launch the fea-
ture and find yourself in control of an interactive magnifying glass that you can move around

the screen during the film and select items for closer inspection. As you collect these “clues”
you receive additional insight about each character. In time, between the sequence of events
in the film and the clues you have found, you decide that you know the guilty party and you
make your selection. At the conclusion of the film you find out that your selection was not
only correct but made in record time.
The hope is that this new paradigm for interactivity provides a compelling new way in
which fans can interact with the content. At the same time, a simple movie-watching experi-
ence is preserved for those who just want to see the film. After all, it is the film that ultimately
drives the purchase of the content, yet many argue that it is the look and feel of the content
that sells the platform.
Target Applications
Beyond the fundamental approach of how content may be accessed, a range of advanced
applications were considered for the platform including (but certainly not limited to) —
j The ability to select objects displayed in the feature video, adding them to a
wishlist for later purchase.
j Viewer-generated bookmarks that make it easy to jump to any part of the disc.
j Popup trivia questions tied to events taking place in the film.
j The screenplay text displayed in a scrolling window next to or over the video,
remaining in sync with the video.
j Multi-player games in which two or more direct viewers can play together simul-
taneously using multiple controllers or multiple players connected over the
Internet.
j Director’s commentary in which the director appears over the video and is able
to point out key areas in the video with graphical indicators (like a chalk board).
j Scrapbook feature in which the viewer is able to take “snapshots” of the film by
pressing a button while the movie plays, making a custom montage of the film.
j Coloring book application in which the viewer can chose a scene from the movie,
and bring up the image for coloring with interactive paint brushes and colors.
The list is a very small set of the types of applications that have been envisioned for the
new disc formats, all of which are designed around the feature itself.
Creating the Paradigm
A BD player, although vastly more advanced than a DVD player, is still a constrained
device, with specific limits on memory capacity, processing speed, and bandwidth. In part,
this is due to the realities of trying to build a reasonably priced player, because a $10,000
player would not sell very well. Further, it is also due to the need for interoperability across
the different players that will be manufactured.
Interactivity

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

To ensure that a piece of authored content operates consistently on all players, minimum
requirements have to be put on the players to allow files of a certain size to be handled and
to be able to handle a certain amount of graphics in real time. These minimum requirements
place constraints on content since a producer will generally want the material to work on all
players, and staying within the minimum requirements of the players is the only way that can
be guaranteed.
This concept of building applications within the constraints of the platform is often quite
different than what is actually done in today’s software development community. With the
ever-growing and ever-changing PC market, there is no single reference specification and,
therefore, no guarantee of cross-compatibility. As a result, application developers must
define the platform for which they will build their application. These requirements are often
listed on the product packaging so that the consumer can make sure that the software will
work in their PC. If their system does not meet the minimum requirements, then they know
that the software will probably not work, and they may chose to upgrade their system so it
will. This could be thought of as a best effort approach, in which the PC is only expected to
make its best effort to run the software. If the PC does not meet the minimum requirements,
then its best effort is not likely to be good enough. This allows a user to enhance their PC
and to grow their capabilities at their own pace, but it also creates an extremely complex mar-
ket with frequent incompatibility problems and general market confusion.
However, because people have grown up with this model of computer development,
expectations for software seem to be much lower than for other types of products. For exam-
ple, you would not expect your car to crash (literally or figuratively) by itself now and then;
in fact, that would be completely unacceptable — and, yet, one usually expects software to
crash from time to time, like it or not.
Let’s put it this way, if you knew that your car’s steering wheel or brakes would lock up
once every few hundred miles and could only be fixed by closing all the windows, shutting off
the ignition, and then restarting the car, you would probably sue the manufacturer for creat-
ing a faulty automobile. However, we don’t see software users up in arms about applications
that crash every few weeks and require them to close all the windows and restart the
machine.
DVD and BD players fall on the automobile side of the equation — they have to work
faithfully. So we return to constraints. The trick for content producers is to think imagina-
tively about how to get interesting new content to look different from other content on the
market, while still ensuring their content will work within the minimum system constraints.
It is also important that the device be designed from the start to handle the target applica-
tion and, in the case of BD players, the seamless user experience.
Designed for Interactivity
The BD format has been designed for the seamless user experience by defining an inde-
pendent interactive graphics plane that overlays the video. This graphics plane can be con-
trolled by authoring and can be filled with popup graphics of all sorts, including those nec-
Interactivity

essary for overlaying menus with alpha-blending so that portions of the graphics can appear
translucent or completely transparent. In addition, application resources such as image data
can be cached so that they can be accessed seamlessly during disc playback. (Caching, or pre-
loading of content, is necessary to prevent the disc pickup head from having to seek to anoth-
er part of the disc to read the data, thus interrupting the main feature playback.) There is
also a timing mechanism that allows applications to trigger different functions at specific
points during feature playback, such as showing the option for a director’s commentary or
video game that is synchronized to the movie. By building these features into the format, the
designers helped to ensure that the interaction model operates smoothly even on constrained
devices.
Additional Features
In addition to the seamless user experience, several other key features have a significant
effect on how people interact with the disc content. For example, the BD format includes
Internet connectivity as a key feature in the player, as well as local, persistent storage and
provides for multiple types of input devices.
Internet Connected Players
Although the player itself is not required to be attached to the Internet, many BD pro-
ducers are creating exciting new forms of content that should make it worth the effort to
establish an Internet connection. 
In addition to self-updating content, such as cast and crew biographies or upcoming
movies, an Internet connection allows downloadable supplemental content, such as audio
and subtitle streams that were not available when the disc was released (see Network
Connection in Chapter 3 for more information). This use of networked content may not only
make a BD title seem boundless, it also introduces new interaction characteristics that DVD
never had to address. The fundamental shift is that the BD-J model is much more like Web
design than the DVD model, and it requires a very different skill set.
An Internet connection also makes it possible for users to connect to other users and to
other devices, computers and Internet-connected mobile phones. In a sense, every connect-
ed player is a simple Web device. With the right kind of BD-J programming on a disc or
downloaded from a server, users can send e-mail, participate in multi-player chats or games,
or send content to mobile phones.
Key differences between networked content and traditional disc-based material are the
access time and the quality of service. DVD has established expectations for disc-based con-
tent. For instance, each jump from one point to another, though usually not seamless, com-
pletes in a few seconds or less. This, however, is rarely the case for access to network con-
tent, as it may take quite some time to identify the server, locate the content, and download
enough of it into the player’s buffers to start playback. Likewise, there is always the possibil-
ity that something in the chain fails — the connection to the player could be faulty, the home
Interactivity

router could have problems, the external connection to the Internet may go down, or the
server itself may be down or overloaded with incoming requests. As a result, applications that
use networked content must be designed to handle such situations.
In general, there can be a delay between action and response of about ten seconds before
a person thinks a system is broken.1 Ten seconds may sound like a short period of time but
imagine pressing a doorbell and having to count 1, 2, 3, ... up to 10, before you finally hear
the doorbell sound. Ten seconds seems like a long time now, doesn’t it? With networked con-
tent, it can easily take ten seconds or longer to begin playback, so it is imperative that the sys-
tem provide feedback that an operation is underway. Likewise, because delays associated
with network access tend to be somewhat random in duration, it becomes very important that
the feedback provided is informative enough that the user will realize what is happening. For
example, take the standard computer approach of having an hourglass cursor indicate that
the computer is busy doing something. This does provide feedback to the user, but it is not
very informative. After a few seconds, the user starts to wonder if the system has broken
down. On the other hand, if a progress bar is used to show how much content has actually
downloaded, then the user can clearly tell if the content is coming or if the system hung up
at the start, before any of the material had actually downloaded. But, on the third hand, a
progress bar that pops up for only a second is distracting and confusing, so the feedback sys-
tem needs to respond to actual network conditions if at all possible, providing feedback (such
as a sound or a graphic change) immediately and providing a dynamically calibrated progress
bar or a “please wait” notice only if the delay stretches past a few seconds.
Not only does BD content need to provide clear feedback for network operations, but it
also must be built with the expectation that the networked content may not be accessible.
Imagine a photo gallery with images that are periodically updated online. If the feature is
authored on the disc so that you can go to the photo gallery even when there is no network
connection, the experience will be pretty bad as the gallery will present an empty display.
One way to address this would be to simply disallow the feature, or to hide it altogether,
when the server is unreachable. However, that can lead to confusion when the viewer sees
the feature available on the same disc in a friend’s player who has a network connection. A
third alternative which, perhaps, offers the best experience for the non-networked user, is to
have a collection of photos for the gallery already stored on disc. Those with a network con-
nection can download additional photos, while those without a connection may still have an
acceptable experience.
A helpful approach is to have network access occur in the background while the movie is
playing. Since such transfers require relatively low data rates, processing time, and memory,
BD players can generally perform background transfers fairly easily. For instance, one might
download the latest movie trailer to local storage while the movie plays so that when the

1Robert B. Miller, in his seminal 1968 paper, Response Time in Man-Computer Conversational Transactions,
found that a response time of one tenth of a second seems instantaneous and gives the viewer a sense of
direct control; a response time of up to one second is fast enough for viewers to feel they are interacting
freely without interruption albeit less in control; and a response time of ten seconds or less is needed to keep
the user’s attention focused on the task. For more information, including the history of research into computer
response times, see Speed up Your Site, by Andrew B. King.

movie is finished the download will have completed and the trailer may be played immedi-
ately following the film (making it a trailer in the true sense of the word).
Another way in which network-connected players may affect the interaction model is
through the use of hooks, which can be authored into a disc prior to their scheduled release
such that the disc automatically checks the network server for any new applications or con-
tent that it should download. Such hooks can be placed at key locations within the playback
sequence, such as when the disc is first started, just before the film plays, just after the film
plays, and so on. Likewise, the hooks can be designed so that if the server does not have any
content for them, they continue playing normally, but if the server does have available con-
tent it will download and launch. In this way, one can “future proof” a disc so that new con-
tent and applications can be added after release of the product. For instance, let’s say a movie
is released on disc with one of these hooks. Two years later a sequel for the movie is made.
Using the hook on the disc, a notification or a full-blown movie trailer can appear whenever
the disc is played in a networked player, alerting viewers who would most likely want to know
about a sequel.
Local Storage
Another key Blu-ray feature is local storage, which can range from built-in 64 MB of flash
memory up to a multi-gigabyte hard drive. And, removable flash memory and network stor-
age are options that players can support in addition to or instead of the built-in storage.
Local storage allows information and content to be saved between playback sessions. In con-
trast, with DVD, as soon as you eject a disc from the player, all memory associated with that
disc is cleared. As a result, there is no way to distinguish the first time a disc is played from
the hundredth time. If you were playing a DVD video game and just reached your highest
score, it would be forgotten by the player the moment the disc was removed. However, with
Blu-ray’s local storage feature, the player will be able to save your score so that it is remem-
bered the next time you insert the disc.
Local storage can have other interesting uses, as well, many of which improve the way discs
work. For example, multi-disc box sets are very popular. Whenever it is necessary to eject one
disc and load another, the local storage can be used to save information about what to do
when the new disc is loaded, and the unbound BD-J application can continue to run during
the disc change. It is possible for each disc to have a complete menu for the set, so that when
something is selected that is on another disc, the menu can ask the viewer to insert the appro-
priate disc, and when the other disc is inserted it can automatically check local storage to see
if it should jump immediately to the chosen point, bypassing logo sequences, warning
screens, menus, and such.
Local storage can also be used to store disc status information. A producer creates a disc
with many different elements and it may be helpful for the viewer to keep track of which ele-
ments have already been viewed, even across multiple sessions. For example, imagine an
exercise program in which the disc helps you set up an ideal workout session with appropri-
ate time assigned to different exercises, mapped out over a period of months. The disc can
Interactivity

10
Blu-ray Disc Demystified

present the appropriate exercises for each session and can even be used to help track the per-
formance (weight, strength, etc.) of multiple users throughout the course of the program.
Local storage is not unlimited, so when it fills up the player may delete the oldest entries
first or may allow the user. Therefore, use of local storage must be designed to respond
gracefully if no data is present.
Specialized User Input
Perhaps one of the greatest challenges that producers of next-generation content must
deal with is the increased complexity of user input. Many applications require keyboard
input, such as entering an e-mail address or a name and address for transactions. However,
most players do not have a physical keyboard. Therefore, the BD-J application may need to
provide a virtual keyboard. Likewise, some applications work much better with a mouse or a
game controller, but most players do not come with a mouse or trackball so, again, the stan-
dard remote control must be accommodated. Designers must pay careful attention to the
lack of direct manipulation caused by the simplistic and indirect up/down/left/right/enter con-
trols. It is possible for Blu-ray players to support a wide range of input devices, which is a
tremendous benefit that allows for more creative applications, but it complicates interoper-
ability because the application developer usually does not know what controllers each user
will have. Another challenge that content producers face is inter-application navigation. Blu-
ray makes it possible to have multiple applications active and displayed simultaneously, each
with its own user interface. Due to the complexities of navigating among different interactive
elements (even within a single application), the specifications do not generally provide for
automatic inter-application navigation. As a result, an author must remain constantly aware
of what applications might be active at any time and determine how to navigate among them
(or always use just one application).
One of the more forward-thinking features is support for a generic device framework. This
allows new types of controllers to be created and used after the launch of the format. By sup-
porting a method of acquiring raw data input from a controller, applications can be written
to support new and innovative types of input devices such as specialized kiosk controllers,
new game pads, biometric devices, or other types of input devices that  have yet to be con-
ceived.

Chapter 11
Use in Business and
Education
The primary focus for marketing DVD and Blu-ray Disc™is, of course, home entertain-
ment. However, the effectiveness of video has long been recognized for instruction and
learning. DVD-Video has been hugely successful in business and education for advertising,
marketing and communications, training, self-instruction, museum installations, video signs,
and much, much more, especially because of the extremely low cost of DVD players. Digital
video on hard disks or flash memory and Internet-delivered video have begun to make a dent
in the roles that DVD carved out, but there remains an important role for Blu-ray, especial-
ly with its superior interactivity, high-definition video, and relatively low cost.
The Appeal of Blu-ray
Blu-ray has distinct advantages over other media, such as videotape, print, CD-ROM,
DVD, and the Internet. For example, the capability of Blu-ray discs to carry large amounts
of high definition, full-screen video makes it more compelling, more effective, and more
entertaining. Blu-ray players are actually sophisticated computers that a decade ago would
have cost thousands of dollars.1 Much of what can be done with a computer and Web tech-
nology can be done more simply, in a more standardized fashion, more accessibly, and less
expensively with Blu-ray. Other benefits include — 
j Low cost. Production and replication costs of Blu-ray discs are surprisingly low
compared to videotape, CD and, even, DVD, especially when cost calculations
take the larger capacity into account. Corporate and government databases that
would fill dozens or hundreds of DVD-ROMs or CD-ROMs can be put on a few
Blu-ray discs, with one BD-50 taking the place of 70 CDs.
j Simple, inexpensive, reliable distribution. Five-inch discs are easier and cheap-
er to mail than tapes or books. Optical discs are not susceptible to damage from
magnetic fields, x-rays, or even cosmic rays, which can damage tapes and mag-
netic discs in transit. A single disc is easier to store than bulky videotapes or
audiotapes and multiple CDs or DVDs. Production is quicker, logistics are sim-
pler, and inventory is streamlined. Although flash memory cards are becoming
ubiquitous, they are not suited for inexpensive mass distribution. At 2008 prices

1Amazingly, the Silicon Graphics Indy workstations used in the late 90’s to run DVD authoring software such
as Scenarist, with CPUs at less than 200 MHz and RAM less than 512MB, cost around thirty thousand U.S.
dollars. A typical Blu-ray player, at a fraction of that cost, has a CPU running faster than 300 MHz and a few
hundred megabytes of RAM, not to mention multistream hardware decoding for video and audio.

of around $5 per gigabyte, flash memory was over 100 times more expensive
than Blu-ray discs. The cost to stream video over the Internet in 2008 ranged
from around 10 cents per gigabyte (at high volumes above 500 terabytes per
month) to over 50 cents per gigabyte. By comparison, BD-50 replication costs
ranged from around 2.5 cents per gigabyte (at volumes over 100,000) to over 10
cents per gigabyte, including AACS license, certificate, and per-disc fees. Add
the cost to mail a disc via two-day U.S. Priority Mail and the total delivered cost
per gigabyte was 12 to 19 cents. Consider that you need an Internet connection
faster than 2.5 Mbps to download one BD-50’s worth of data in two days.2 If you
used next-day express delivery to cut the time to 24 hours or less (equivalent to
a 5.8 Mbps Internet connection) then the cost per delivered gigabyte would
increase to around 30 to 38 cents. Ship ten discs in one envelope (equivalent to
a 58 Mbps Internet connection) and the cost would be only 5 to 12 cents per
gigabyte. These comparisons vary for different countries, of course, and for
retail distribution there are other factors such as distribution and inventory
management, but the bottom line is that the cost to deliver a movie over the
Internet is not significantly less than — and in some cases it is much greater than
— the cost to replicate and ship the same movie on a Blu-ray disc.
j Broad availability. Blu-ray players are relatively inexpensive, available from
many sources and manufacturers, and have a variety of outputs to hook to
almost any high-definition display and associated audio equipment. Because vir-
tually all Blu-ray players can also play DVD-Video discs and audio CDs, it is a
simple matter to replace an existing player.
j High capacity. A dual-layer BD-50 can hold more than six hours of high-defin-
ition video, over 25 hours of standard-definition video, and over 75 hours of
video compressed at VHS videotape quality (which is still much better than
what we have become accustomed to from YouTube and other Internet sources).
This much video would take more than a day to transmit over the Internet with
a typical 3 to 5 Mbps cable connection, or more than seven days with a 768 kbps
DSL connection. As detailed above in the distribution section, dozens of hours
of video and hundreds of gigabytes of data can be sent anywhere in the world by
slipping a few discs into an overnight express mailer for less than the actual cost
of Internet transmission.
j Sophisticated interactivity. Other sections of this book go into detail about what
can be done with HDMV and BD-J, so suffice it to say that Blu-ray has a major
advantage over DVD and all other mainstream packaged media formats — with

2Actual Internet data transfer speeds are lower than the “rated” speed that your ISP touts. 50 gigabytes of
data can be downloaded in 24 hours at 2.3 Mbps, but transmission efficiency taking into account protocol
overhead, retries, and concurrent traffic is typically around 70 to 80%, which means you actually need a 2.9 to
3.3 Mbps connection to achieve 2.3 Mbps download speed. According to speedmatters.org, the median
broadband download speed in the U.S in 2008 was, coincidentally, 2.3 Mbps, which is 15th place after coun-
tries such as Japan (63 Mbps), South Korea (49 Mbps), France (17 Mbps), and Canada (7.6 Mbps). The
Speed Matters report pointed out that the increase from 2007 to 2008 in the U.S. was a mere 0.4 Mbps, at
which rate it would take the U.S. until after 2108 to catch up to Japan’s speed in 2008.

the obvious exception of computer and video game software — by virtue of a
rich and powerful interactive model with a very simple remote-control interface.
Just about anything that can be done on the Internet with Java and HTML can
be done on a Blu-ray disc — minus the download delays and poor quality video.
With BD Live it can be updated and expanded ad infinitum.
j Self-contained ease of use. Blu-ray programs can include integrated instruction
with on-screen text, popup help, and full interaction. Rather than being tied to
a linear presentation, the viewer can select appropriate material, instantly
repeat any piece, or jump from section to section. Unlike older commercial
media such as videotape, audiotape, and laserdisc, Blu-ray Discs need no ancil-
lary printed material for training or user education — everything explaining how
to use the disc can be put on the disc itself.
j Portability. A portable Blu-ray player, about the size of a hardback book, can be
slipped into a briefcase and hooked up to any high-definition television or video
monitor (and some players can downscale for standard televisions). One-on-one
or small-group presentations can be done using a portable player with an inte-
grated LCD video screen or a laptop computer with a Blu-ray drive. Large-audi-
ence presentations can be done with a video projector and a player or laptop
computer. There are even high-definition video projectors with built-in DVD or
Blu-ray players. Beyond presentations, portable players and laptops can be used
for training and learning in any location.
j Desktop HD video publishing. Desktop video editing and recordable DVD did
to the video industry what desktop publishing and laser printers did to the print
industry. The same thing is happening to the film and HD video industries with
HD equipment and Blu-ray technology. Video production can be done from
beginning to end with inexpensive consumer or prosumer equipment and a com-
puter. A complete setup is remarkably affordable — a consumer-grade high-
definition digital video camera (under $2000) can be plugged into a digital video
editing computer with a BD-recordable drive (under $2000), and the final prod-
uct can be assembled and recorded onto a BD-R disc with BD authoring soft-
ware (less than $200). This constitutes an entire high-definition video publish-
ing system on a desktop for under $4,000, or under $2000 at the low-end.
j Mixed media. As with DVD, Blu-ray is a melting pot for many different infor-
mation sources. A single disc can contain all the information normally provided
by such disparate sources as videotapes, newspapers, computer databases,
audiotapes, printed directories, and information kiosks. Training videos can be
accompanied with printable manuals, product demonstrations can include spec
sheets and order forms, databases can include Internet links for updated infor-
mation, product catalogs can include video demonstrations, and so on. Blu-ray
is the perfect medium for this because it provides high-definition video (unlike
DVD or the Internet); searchable, dynamic text (unlike paper); hours and hours
of random-access audio (unlike tapes); and, a rapidly growing base of devices to
read it all.

The Appeal of Blu-ray for Video
The conveniences of Blu-ray video, which in the home are enjoyable but not essential, are
translated in the office into efficiency and effectiveness. Blu-ray also brings computers into
the picture. Unlike in the home, where some may question the value of being able to play a
movie on a computer, the usefulness of computers in the office doing double duty as video
players is clearly apparent.
The natural inclination when developing material for computers is to take advantage of
the additional features, such as keyboard entry, graphic interactivity, and so on, but in many
cases this is counterproductive and inefficient. Simpler may be better.
There are certain advantages to Blu-ray based multimedia compared to traditional com-
puter multimedia, especially the more straightforward HDMV format —
j Easier development at a lower cost. For simple titles there are fewer program-
ming and design requirements. Creating a set of menu screens and related video
can be done with low-end, low-cost Blu-ray authoring packages.
j Easier for the customer. The limited interface is simple to learn and is usually
accessible using a remote control. Hooking a player to a TV is much simpler
than getting a multimedia computer to work.
j Familiar interface. Menus and remote controls are similar.
j Larger audience and no cross-platform complications. Blu-ray-equipped com-
puters, Blu-ray players, and even video game consoles can all play standard Blu-
ray Discs.
Certain kinds of programs lend themselves better to Blu-ray video, including programs
with large amounts of video, programs intended for users who may not be comfortable with
computers, programs with still pictures accompanied by extensive audio, and so on. Here are
a few examples of material well-suited for Blu-ray video —
j Employee orientation and sensitivity training 
j Press kits, corporate reports, or newsletters 
j Emergency response training or information systems 
j Product demonstrations and catalogs 
j Information kiosks - product/service searches, traveler’s aid, and way-finding 
j Product training 
j Sales and marketing tools 
j Educational learning kits 
j Video tours or video brochures 
j Collections of conferences and lectures for churches and associations
j Video “billboards” 
j Video greeting/holiday “cards” 
j Testing, including licenses and professional certification 
j Video portfolios (ads, promo spots, and demo reels) 
j Trade show demo discs

j Point-of-sale displays 
j Ambient video and music 
j Video “business cards” 
j Video “yearbooks” 
j Lecture support resources 
j Repair and maintenance manuals 
j Medical informed consent information 
j Video tributes for anniversaries, awards, and funerals
j Patient information systems and home health special needs instructions 
j Language translation assistance
j Home videos and photos
Blu-ray video, of course, has its disadvantages when compared with other media.
Following are a few examples of material where Blu-ray may not be well suited, especially
related to computer applications. (Of course, a Blu-ray Disc can contain computer software
in addition to player-based video.)
j Interface. Other devices, such as computers, allow keyboard entry and point-
and-click graphic interface. Some Blu-ray players can be equipped with mice,
keyboards, and even game-console-style hardware such as infrared batons, bal-
ance boards, and steering wheels, but these are not typically available on stan-
dard players.
j Text entry. An on-screen keyboard can be used with the remote control for
entering text, but it is cumbersome compared to a computer keyboard.
j Documentation and databases. Text may be difficult to read from normal TV
viewing distance. Searching requires unwieldy text entry using the remote con-
trol.
j Productivity applications. Word processing, checkbook balancing, e-mail, et
cetera, can actually be implemented in rudimentary fashion using BD-J, but are
generally impractical compared to computer implementations.
j Memory. Blu-ray players have persistent data storage, but it is limited in size and
may be deleted by the user.
The Appeal of Blu-ray for Data
Because a Blu-ray Disc can contain any type of computer data and software, the content
possibilities are practically endless. Video and audio, of course, are simply another form of
digital data but, in general, when people talk about data on optical discs they are referring to
computer data such as software applications, text files, and so on. Often the term BD-ROM
is used to refer to data-only discs, even when they are recordable, which is a misnomer.
Although CD-ROMs and recordable CDs are still widely used for PC applications and
data storage, DVD-ROM and recordable DVDs have become more popular. DVD drives
have become even more popular, as they can read and write CDs. Blu-ray will displace DVD
Use in Business and Education

for applications requiring large amounts of data storage and, eventually, when Blu-ray drives
approach the price of DVD drives, they will become the dominant hardware format. That
said, recordable DVD discs will continue to be widely used because of lower cost and com-
patibility with older systems.
Sales and Marketing
Blu-ray is an excellent sales and presentation tool. A complete presentation system can be
contained in a portable player. DVD proved popular for this, and Blu-ray has the advantage
of much more detail and readability on high-definition displays. Home sales presentations,
for example, can be enhanced greatly by professional video supplements provided on disc.
The presenter simply plugs a portable player into the customer’s TV or puts a disc in the cus-
tomer’s player. Unlike videotape, which must be watched in a linear manner, a DVD or Blu-
ray Disc can contain different segments for different scenarios, with answers to common
questions, and so on, all quickly accessible from menus. The need to train sales and market-
ing representatives is reduced by having them rely on prepared presentations to be called up,
as needed.
A point-of-information kiosk or a trade show video presentation is vastly improved with
Blu-ray. The disc can be set to loop forever — customers will not wander off as they did when
a black screen appeared after the tape ran out or while it rewound. Full interactivity, either
directly for the person using the kiosk or for a representative working an exhibit, can be pro-
vided on the disc. 
Product catalogs with thousands of photographs and video vignettes can be put on a sin-
gle disc for a fraction of the cost of printed catalogs. Of course, the video catalog cannot be
read at the kitchen table — at least not until thin “videopad” players become available.
Environmental resource waste from printed catalogs is becoming a big concern.
Environmentally conscious companies can replace tons of paper with polycarbonate discs. By
producing discs that connect back to the company Web site via the Internet, the life of the
discs can be extended with updated prices, product information, new promotions, and other
supplements. 
A Blu-ray Disc can contain literally hundreds of hours of audio, any part of which can be
accessed in seconds, making it the perfect vehicle for instructional audio programs. 
Communications 
Companies spend billions of dollars a year producing printed information, much of which
requires unwieldy indexes and other reference material merely to make it accessible. In addi-
tion, much of it becomes out of date in a very short time. Corporate and product informa-
tion is moving more and more to the Internet but, for large publications or those that bene-
fit from a graphic or video element, Blu-ray provides a cost-effective means of distribution
coupled with improved access to the content. 
Blu-ray is also a high-impact business-to-business communications tool. It can be used as
a standalone “no instructions needed” communication device or it can back up an in-person

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

presentation. The message can include high-quality corporate videos, advertising clips, inter-
views with staff, video introductions, dynamic video press releases, visual instruction manu-
als, and documentaries of corporate events such as new office openings and seminars. 
Companies can send free discs in the mail to targeted audiences. Unlike VHS tapes, which
people often ignore because they don’t want to have to sit through the whole thing, video on
disc can be broken into small, easily digested segments that the viewer can select from on-
screen menus. This revolutionizes the way businesses can communicate with their customers
and with other businesses. The discs can be played in both settop players and computers, so
traveling executives might be tempted to pop a free disc into their Blu-ray-equipped laptop
computer while flying or when sitting in a hotel room, for instance. 
Highly effective video-supported presentation demands on-the-fly, instant, context-sensi-
tive access to any point in the footage. Linear presentations are woefully inadequate for this
task. Even most computer-delivered video is, by comparison, stuck in a previous decade with
limited random access, a single audio track, and no subtitle tracks. You can pop a video onto
YouTube, but the clunky accessibility makes it useless for much more than casual viewing. By
supporting multiple language tracks a single Blu-ray Disc eradicates geographic and cultur-
al barriers. Whether distributed to individuals for playback on PCs, shown to groups via set-
top players or portable PCs connected to video projectors, or mounted in network servers for
remote viewing, Blu-ray helps get the message to every recipient. Obviously, DVD can do
much of this, as well, albeit with a less sophisticated interface, but in environments where
visual clarity is important, such as, in large-screen presentations, Blu-ray has the advantage.
Training and Business Education 
Now that sufficient numbers of DVD players and DVD-equipped computers are estab-
lished in businesses, there is no question that DVD has become a leading delivery format for
business training. Blu-ray also has a role to play wherever there is a need for longer playing
times, higher video quality, and more advanced interaction combined with Internet connec-
tivity. The Internet alone has certain advantages such as low cost and timeliness, but the
demand for high-quality multimedia far exceeds the capabilities of the typical Internet con-
nection for the near future. Blu-ray and DVD are better suited to deliver quick access to
large amounts of high-quality video and audio, and can be integrated easily with the Internet
to provide the best of both worlds.
The Blu-ray format, supported by Blu-ray players and by Blu-ray navigation software in
computers, is strictly defined in hundreds of pages of technical specifications. Blu-ray con-
tent development requires specialized authoring systems. As with all content authoring sys-
tems, the ease of development is inversely proportional to the flexibility of the tools (Figure
11.1). 
Use in Business and Education

Figure 11.1  The Authoring Environment Spectrum: Utility vs. Ease of Use

As the parameters of the system are constrained, the complexity of the task is reduced.
Since HDMV is quite constrained, it is relatively easy to develop for it, given the proper
tools. BD-J provides more flexibility and power, but at a cost of a steeper learning curve and
more complexity. Anyone considering video training programs should decide if the features
of BDMV or BD-J meet their requirements. A simple product containing menus, pictures,
and video may be developed using Blu-ray in less time and for less money than with a com-
plex computer authoring system.
DVD-Video worked so well for certain corporate education and training applications that
the content sold the hardware. With player prices well under $50, companies spending thou-
sands or millions of dollars on video-based education and training programs do not need to
think twice about equipping their employees or learning laboratories with players. Many
companies that used expensive or specialized systems, such as study kiosks or computers,
have switched to DVD players. As Blu-ray prices drop, it likewise becomes an amazingly
inexpensive and standardized device for video-based instruction.
Blu-ray for computer data, on the other hand, covers the entire spectrum from custom-
programmed software to fill-in-the blank lesson templates. Practically any authoring or soft-
ware development system can produce material to be delivered on BD-ROM or BD-record-
able. The main advantages of Blu-ray over other media are space, data transfer speed, and
cost per byte. Flash memory prices continue to drop as capacities increase, but BD-ROM is
literally orders of magnitude cheaper — cents per gigabyte rather than cents per megabyte.
For distributing hundreds or thousands of copies, flash memory is simply not cost effective
compared to Blu-ray. Byte-per-byte, Blu-ray is even cheaper than DVD. Blu-ray drive trans-
fer rates are similar to hard disks, and even though the access rates are slower, in many cases
Blu-ray’s higher capacity and lower cost more than compensate. 
Industrial Applications 
Both Blu-ray and DVD are being used increasingly in specialized applications. Custom
material produced for recordable discs can be unique and focused. Installations can use inex-
pensive, off-the-shelf players. More demanding installations may use professional-grade
players, which are more reliable and can be connected to specialized hardware, such as mul-
tiplayer controllers, video synchronizers, video walls, touch screens, custom input devices,
lighting controllers, robotic controllers and more. Cheap kiosks can be made from an inex-
pensive player and an input device such as a trackball or touch screen.
A few examples of industrial applications include —

j Point-of-purchase displays

Classroom Education
Laserdiscs were a success in education almost from day one. Teachers saw the advantage
of rapid access to thousands of pictures and high-impact motion video sequences. They
began investing in laserdisc players and discs after seeing the effectiveness of laserdisc-based
instruction in the classroom. In 1998, 20 years after their debut, more than 250,000 laserdisc
players were still found in schools in the United States. Computer multimedia has largely
replaced laserdisc in the classroom, but the ease of popping in a laserdisc and pressing play,
or scanning a few barcodes, may never be matched by computers with their complicated
cables and software setups and daunting troubleshooting requirements.
Educational publishers were slow to embrace DVD-Video. They did not see a large mar-
ket, and many of them were hurt by the mass flocking of teachers to the Internet as the new
source of free educational technology. Educational video titles require significant work to
develop and must be designed to meet curriculum standards. Purpose-built educational titles
will be even slower to appear for Blu-ray than for DVD. However, DVD and Blu-ray titles
from many other sources help fill the void— documentaries, historical dramas, newsreel
archives, educational television programming, and even popular movies, TV shows, and
“edutainment” programs work well for classroom as well as home education. The particular
advantage of DVD and Blu-ray for this application is random access. Teachers can quickly
jump to any desired video segment and can skip sections during playback. If a computer is
used to play the disc, it can be programmed to show particular sections in a specific order.
As Blu-ray eventually becomes a mainstream vehicle for delivering video, a larger base of
educational content will build up. It will be able to take advantage of Blu-ray features such
as random access to hundreds of video segments, subpicture overlays to enhance video pre-
sentation, on-screen quizzes, games, multiple-scenario presentations, adaptation to learner
needs, multiple languages, tailored commentary tracks, and much more.

Blu-ray Disc Demystified
Chapter 12
Production Essentials
This chapter covers the basics of producing BD-ROM video and computer-based titles. It
is not a detailed production guide, but rather an overview of the production processes which
can serve as a guide and a checklist, as well as an introduction for those who want to under-
stand what is involved. Aspects of BD authoring that are confusing, misunderstood, or over-
looked are also covered.
One of the major changes that has happened since the introduction of DVD is that video-
tape is no longer the predominant format for capturing and working with audio and video.
Production workflows are now file-based, not tape-based. Often, content will likely never
exist on tape (or film) — from the initial production shoot to the final delivery on Blu-ray
Disc™, content will exist as files. Thus, interchange formats are important to be aware of
throughout the production process. You will want to insure that the next step in the process
can accept the output of the previous step.
There are three modes of programming titles — BDAV, HDMV and BD-J. Both HDMV
and BD-J disc elements reside in a directory named BDMV. As a result, there is frequent
confusion as to proper terms, with BDMV being used to mean both HDMV and BD-J.
Extreme care should be exercised when using these terms, and the term BDMV should not
be used for defining a programming mode.
BDAV is used for simple playback, with chapter marks automatically generating thumb-
nail-based menus. For interactivity that takes advantage of all of the capabilities of BD, pro-
gramming will be in either HDMV or BD-J mode. The choice of programming mode deter-
mines the process steps needed to create a Blu-ray Disc master. Note that HDMV or BD-J
mode programming is required for replication.
At this point in time, replication is generally reserved for large volume, high budget titles.
If you want to replicate discs you must include the AACS copy protection scheme. The fees
to use this required scheme are considerable — as of 2008, the fess consist of an annual con-
tent provider fee, a per disc layer fee, and a per replicated disc fee. For small replication runs,
for example less than 2,000 discs, the fees will be more than 50% of your total replication
costs. Also note, if you have to update the disc, for example for a fix, you have to pay the per
layer fee again. Check the AACS site for the latest fees and required agreements at
http://www.aacsla.org.
The quality of HD video is very obvious when it is shown on a big screen, high-definition
monitor. This means that video production must consider everything, from using tripods for
image stabilization to giving added attention to unwanted details, from facial warts and nose
hairs to stray cables, clutter and dirt. “Realistic” takes on a new meaning with HD.
Production capture options include film, HDV, HD SDI, HD-AVC, or HD-MPEG.

Blu-ray Disc Project Examples
BD projects can take a variety of forms. The list in Table 12.1 is not by any means exhaus-
tive, but it does illustrate the ways that BD can go far beyond a presentation of linear video
transferred from videotape.
General BD Production
Creating a Blu-ray Disc is a complex process. Blu-ray production demands special knowl-
edge, skills and training in a number of disciplines including HD video production, interac-
tive design, animation, programming and quality control. BD production is surprisingly more
difficult than DVD-ROM or CD-ROM production. BD builds upon the earlier disc formats
and has more capabilities and more flexibility, and thus more potential for things that can go
wrong. Just as in the early days of DVD, tools are still being defined and refined. What is
considered “best practice” is rapidly evolving. The workflow and the tools will improve and
the process will become easier, but in the meantime do not assume that making a BD is the
same as making a DVD.
Simple AV Playback Mode
Many cameras record in AVCHD or BDAV format. Also, many computer-based video
editing programs support output to DVD-R or BD-R using either of these formats. This

mode is relatively easy to create and gives you full HD video but with limited audio and video
codec support and limited interactivity. But, it is high definition, and it can be played back
on most BD players. For AVCHD mode, simple menus are possible with some implementa-
tions. For BDAV mode, you can get thumbnail menus of each clip. This mode is not bad, but
it is not all of what is promised for Blu-ray. For high definition video use at home or simple
playback applications, it is a great start.
The rest of this chapter will focus on the process required to create the more complex
interactive titles.
HDAV and BD-J Modes
Creating titles in HDMV or BD-J mode requires more extensive tools and processes than
for the simple BDAV playback mode.
HDMV and BD-J require interactive design, careful planning and execution of a number
of skilled operations including compression, multiplexing, graphics creation, authoring/pro-
gramming and, finally, testing to realize the finished title.
The HDMV and BD-J modes of interactive programming utilize the compressed and mul-
tiplexed audio, video and subtitle streams. These streams are declared as clips which, in turn,
are used to create playlists. The playback of a title, whether in HDMV or BD-J mode, calls
on these playlists. The interactive components of the user interface are composed of many
graphical elements. The programming and the design steps must work closely together to
implement the desired experience of a highly interactive, entertaining user interface. HDMV
mode programming is more closely related to DVD authoring in that you are assembling and
connecting the graphics elements to define the navigational experience via buttons, interac-
tions, animations and button sounds. Even with HDMV mode, though, there is a higher level
of programming available than with DVD. For example, instead of the 16 registers (called
GRPMs) that are available for DVD, you now have access to 2,048 registers (now called
GPRs) with BD.
BD-J Mode programming supports all of the capabilities of the Blu-ray specification
including the Bonus View (Profile 1.1) and BD-Live (Profile 2.0) features. Creating a disc
using BD-J code is on a difficulty level that is on a par with creating a video game for a game
console or writing software applications. Discs created using BD-J can also be complement-
ed with the use of HDMV code. For example, the opening language selection logic, copyright
notices, studio logo splashes, trailers, et cetera, could use HDMV mode to take advantage of
the fact that HDMV mode starts playing faster than BD-J because the player does not have
to first load the BD-J code and graphics.
The final step of creating a BD is combining the multiplexed streams and the interactive
programming into a master image for replication. Creating the BD cutting master format
(BD CMF) image requires specialized software systems. At the introduction of BD, two
authoring systems were commercially available, Sonic Solutions’ Scenarist BD, and Sony’s
Blu-print. Both of these systems require a major commitment (fast, powerful workstations
with licensing agreements that cost in a range in the tens of thousands of dollars plus annu-
al support contracts as well as a steep learning curve). These systems support the entire
Production Essentials

process of HDMV mode authoring as well as multiplexing and premastering (output of the
BD CMF image for replication). Other lower-cost and basic-capability systems are also avail-
able from Sonic, Adobe, NetBlender and others that allow multiplexing, HDMV mode
authoring and the creation of the BD CMF images. Many of these systems also allow the
integration of BD-J mode programming. The differences between the high-end systems and
the lower-cost systems is that the high-end systems support all of the features of the specifi-
cation, such as secondary audio and video, full animated HDMV menus, slideshows, seam-
less branching, et cetera. Check out the lower-cost systems. They may meet your needs, but
for support of all of the BD specification features for advanced titles, the high-end systems
will be required.
For compression, many of the companies who had tools for DVD either extended those
tools or created new tools for the new codecs supported by BD. Most of the encoding solu-
tions are software-based with a substantial workstation or multi-CPU cluster server platform
required. High- end compression solutions include Sonic’s Cinevision (MPEG2, VC1 and
AVC), CinemaCraft (AVC), Thomson's NexCode (AVC), Inlet Technologies' Fathom
(MPEG2, VC1 and AVC) and Microsoft’s VC1 encoder (distributed and supported by Sonic
Solutions). Many other encoding solutions also support high definition BD-compliant output
for MPEG2, VC-1 and AVC (MPEG4, part 10). Look for products from Apple, Main
Concept, Canopus Procoder, Sorenson, Avid, Adobe and TMPGEnc for other compression
solutions. The quality of the results, control of the encode, the speed of the encode, and the
workflow, are all factors that distinguish one solution from another and determine the
applicability of any solution for your production. Commercial high-end compression systems
range from $50,000 to $250,000. Just as with the early days of DVD, expect that new solu-
tions will be introduced by many of the DVD mainstay companies as well as many newcom-
ers. After a few years, expect the tools to range from barebones, consumer-oriented author-
ing applications priced at less than $75 to full-featured compression, authoring and multi-
plexing packages that cost thousands of dollars but do far more than the initial, first-genera-
tion systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Producing a Blu-ray Disc is significantly different from producing older formats, such as
videotape, laserdisc, audio CD, or CD-ROM. It has many similarities to producing a DVD-
Video disc or producing a video game. There are basically six stages —
j interaction design and graphics creation
j encoding/compression
j authoring and/or programming
j multiplexing and premastering
j testing, and
j replication (mastering)
Blu-ray production costs are currently much higher than the costs for DVD. The list of
extra features for Blu-ray, such as multiple sound tracks, camera angles, synchronized lyrics,
subtitles, secondary audio and video, network connectivity capabilities, interactive program-
ming and so on, can be long and the costs expensive. On a per-byte basis, Blu-ray costs may
be about the same as DVD, but Blu-ray can hold 5-10 times as many bytes. The actual pro-
Production Essentials

ject costs have tracked this per-byte metric for production costs through replication on the
early titles. Over time, just as with DVD and, before that, CD, Blu-ray production costs will
come down as tools are developed and refined.
Authoring/programming costs are proportionately the most expensive part of BD produc-
tion. Video, audio, and subtitles must be encoded, menus have to be laid out and integrated
with audio and video, and control information has to be created. This all has to be multi-
plexed into a single data stream and finally laid down in a low-level format.
In comparison, videotapes did not have significant authoring or formatting costs, aside
from video editing, but they were more expensive to replicate. The same was true for
laserdiscs, which also included premastering and mastering costs. CDs require formatting
and mastering, but cost less than DVDs.
For the replication factories, BD production requires a major new investment in laser
beam recorders, stampers, and replication lines that support the new 405nm laser wavelength
of Blu-ray as opposed to the 605nm for DVD. Dual-layer BDs cost slightly more to replicate
because they are more difficult to produce. Eventually, mastering and replication costs will
likely drop to levels slightly higher than that of DVD. Don’t forget that the total cost for a
BD or DVD includes all of the packaging, and these packaging costs can easily exceed the
actual disc replication costs.
BD-5 or BD-9 or BD-25 or BD-50?
The type of disc to be used is generally mandated by the size of the content. BD-5 and BD-
9 are the cousins to DVD-5 and DVD-9 and are single and dual layer discs, respectively, that
have been premastered for the Blu-ray file structure. Using BD-5 or BD-9 means that you
lose the copy protection scheme of ROM mark which is required for BD-25 and BD-50.
Smaller projects (25 to 45 minutes of video) may be very appropriate for BD-5 and BD-9
discs and can be duplicated using recordable DVDs. 
BD-25 is a single layer disc and BD-50 is a dual layer disc. The added costs for BD-50
replication, which run about 25-50 percent more, mean that you want to pay attention to your
bit budget. Exceeding a single layer disc’s bit budget by even a few bits means a big differ-
ence in the replication costs if you have to move up to a BD-50 disc.
Recordable discs, either DVD+/-R/RW or BD-R/RE, can be used for distribution of the
final project as well as for prototypes and testing during development. One advantage of
using recordable media is that AACS is not required. Beware that BD-R/RE is still very
expensive compared to DVD recordable media. Also, the record times can be as long as 3
hours for a full BD-50 disc.
Tasks and Skills
Many skills and processes are needed for BD production. The larger the facility, the more
specialized each position is. No facility is likely to have all facets down to perfection, but
many have multiple areas of expertise or relationships with other service providers. Smaller
BD production shops may rely on outside facilities to do much of the technical production
work.

The following list covers the essential job positions of BD production. These could be
combined into a few positions or spread over a number of people. Rare is the person who
excels at all tasks of BD production, although it is a good idea to cross-train personnel so they
can assist in other areas, as needed.
j A project designer works with clients and is responsible for layout, design, and gen-
eral budget, and therefore must understand the steps of the production process.
j A project manager deals with minimizing bottlenecks and keeping the project mov-
ing forward. This person should be familiar with all of the production tasks, works
with clients for testing and signoff and is responsible for schedule, coordination,
budget details and asset management.
j A colorist transfers film to video, is responsible for color correction and proper
framing, and often works directly with the director or the director of photography.
j A video editor is responsible for assembling, editing, and preparing all the video
assets for encoding; uses video editing systems, usually digital video editing soft-
ware; may need to restore and clean up footage; may do compositing of video and
computer graphics; and should be familiar with video encoding and BD authoring.
Also, this person must work with the potential for varying video resolutions and
framerates of the source content.
j A video compressionist must understand the codec(s) and encoders — MPEG-2,
VC-1 or AVC compression. Each of these codecs and the compression hardware
or software have their own idiosyncracies that must be well understood to get great
results. Often DVNR or preprocessing is required to get the quality of encode at
the desired/required bitrate; should be familiar with colorist and video editor jobs;
have working knowledge of Blu-ray multiplexing and authoring process; and must
be familiar with professional video equipment.
j An audio compressionist must understand multichannel audio and principles of
perceptual audio encoding; must have in-depth knowledge of details of DTS
and/or Dolby Digital encoding; must be familiar with professional digital and (pos-
sibly) analog audio recording equipment; should be familiar with audio editor’s
job; and have working knowledge of Blu-ray multiplexing and authoring process to
ensure that they can deliver specification-compliant streams that work within the
constraints of the disc size and bitrate budgets.
j A graphic artist is responsible for graphic design, including menus and stills; may be
responsible for user interface design; may also work on disc label and package
design; uses graphics packages such as Adobe Photoshop; and must understand
nuances of integrating various resolutions of HD and SD video. May need to be
familiar with BD authoring system(s) to ensure properly prepared assets with layer
and file names conforming to delivery specification.
j A 2D or 3D animator produces animation sequences for menus and transitions;
uses graphics packages, such as Adobe Creative Suite including products, such as
After Effects and Flash; must understand nuances of video, audio and the capabili-
ties and limitations of the Blu-ray playback devices in rendering animations.

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

j A multiplexor uses specialized Blu-ray applications to create the streams, playlists,
clips that define the structure of the audio, video and subtitles of a disc; must have
detailed knowledge of audio, video, subtitles and their Blu-ray specifications. This
person must also be knowledgeable in navigation design. Often, this person is also
responsible for running and interpreting the results of the verification software
that ensures a disc is specification compliant.
j
An author uses specialized Blu-ray authoring applications; must have detailed
knowledge of Blu-ray specification and navigation design. Advanced authoring
requires programming knowledge.
j A Java programmer knowledgeable on the BD-J specification and the underlying
specifications is essential to creating BD-J based titles unless a packaged commer-
cial or proprietary framework is being used. The development of BD-J-based fea-
tures resembles the workflows, timeframes and costs associated with game devel-
opment.
j A tester is responsible for quality control (QC) of the product; reviews encoded
audio, video, and subtitles; tests navigation; and should be familiar with digital
video and audio. For larger projects, this person will be experienced in the science
of quality testing and be able to develop test strategies and plans, include unit and
regression testing.
The BD Production Process
The BD video and audio production process can be divided into basic steps, which are
shown in Table 12.2. Unlike DVD production, more of the work can — and in some cases
must — be done in parallel. Often the encoding and the multiplexing are happening at the
same time as the authoring and programming steps. The QC and testing steps are also spread
throughout most of a project. Proper project design and careful asset management are keys
to the successful creation of a BD title. Project management in larger, multi-person projects
becomes a must. Many of the steps require multiple iterations to ensure that everything will
work together. For example, after encoding the audio and video, it may be discovered that
the peak bitrates are too high and that either the audio or the video or both needs to be re-
encoded.

Authoring refers to the process of designing and creating the interactivity of a BD title.
The more complex and interactive the disc, the more authoring is required. If a title is cre-
ated using BD-J mode, extensive Java programming may be required. Creating an interac-
tive title is similar to other creative processes such as making a movie, writing a book, creat-
ing a software game or building an electronic circuit. It may include creating an outline,
designing a flowchart, writing a script, sketching storyboards, filming video, recording and
mixing audio, taking photographs, creating graphics and animations, designing a user inter-
face, laying out menus, defining and linking menu buttons, writing captions, creating button
highlight graphics, programming animation and interactivity, encoding audio and video, and
then assembling, organizing, synchronizing, and testing the material. For HDMV mode titles,
authoring is done on an authoring system, which also includes the multiplexing and premas-
tering functions.
At the professional level of tools, encoding of video and audio elementary streams is han-
dled by separate specialized encoders that are separate from the authoring system. Some of
the prosumer- or consumer-level systems will include the encoding function in an integrated
workflow. Using externally encoded streams usually means a higher level of quality.
BD premastering refers to the final multiplexing of the streams, formatting a UDF 2.5
image, padding for AACS data and creating the CMF (Cutting Master Format) image. The
CMF image, which is actually a collection of files, is sent to the replication factory via a very
fast network connection or via shipping as a hard disk drive.
Production Decisions
During the production process, many decisions between different options need to be
made. The choices that are made depend on the particular project's technical and creative
requirements, the budget, the timeframe, and, occasionally, personal preference.
Service Bureau or Home Brew?
You must decide whether to do some, most or all of the work yourself, or to outsource the

work needed to create a BD. Even the larger facilities have a network of partners to do some
of the specialized work whether it be interactive menu design and graphics creation or BD-
J programming for custom widgets or special encoding with a particular codec. All but the
very largest facilities use a partner for their subtitle needs.
The advantages of producing a title yourself are that you have full control of the project
and can make changes, as needed. If you intend to produce a number of BDs, you can build
a base for long-term production. Service bureaus have the advantage of knowledge, experi-
ence, process and the hardware and software tools needed to produce a BD. They have
trained personnel and can usually produce a disc quickly, if necessary. They have tools for
testing and should have a collection of players and BD-drive-equipped PCs for compatibili-
ty testing and quality control.  The specification verifier software, for example, is very expen-
sive, has sometimes difficult to interpret test results, and only needs to be run before repli-
cation. This is a good case for having a third-party partner perform this step.
Service facilities also usually have connections with replicators. They can also guide you
through the AACS licensing process. To find an appropriate service facility for your BD pro-
ject, check with other media producers for referrals, comments and recommendations, or
look in trade magazines and features for knowledgeable BD personnel and service bureaus.
The better companies are well known and are often featured in articles. Advertisements dis-
play the companies with marketing budgets but often the best service providers remain so
busy that they don’t need to advertise for more business.
With a list of several companies in hand, do a comparative analysis between them. Request
company information, including background, personnel, equipment, BD experience
(whether with HDMV or BD-J mode authoring/programming), video and audio encoders,
production capacity, and other available services that can help you with your project. Ask for
a demonstration or sample discs. Once you choose a facility, develop a good relationship and
communicate regularly during projects.
There are many more variables available for the VC-1 and AVC codecs than with MPEG-
2. Depending on the encoder, you may have control of bitrate (CBR, VBR, or constant qual-
ity), GOP structure as well as motion estimation. Variable bitrate (VBR) compression always
enables better quality, especially for video with varying scene complexity. VBR allows using
more bits when needed. Most encoders will only encode with VBR. Since source material is
now often in the form of digital files and not videotape, one- or two-pass VBR does not take
that much longer than a CBR encode. Good VBR encoding is somewhat of a black art and
requires a compressionist experienced with the encoder being used. Constant bitrate (CBR)
compression is cheaper and often faster because it does not require multiple passes, although
many encoders do not offer CBR due to the complexities of the VC-1 and AVC codecs. If
the encoder offers CBR encoding, for projects without a lot of video and with enough band-
width for the high data rate, CBR can achieve the same quality as VBR. Beware, though, that
when using lossless compressed audio, you will not have the bandwidth for high video
bitrates, so you will have to drop the average bitrate to allow the combined audio and video
rates to be within the maximum allowable bitrate. A high quality encoder with a highly skilled
compressionist will be needed to get streams that can be multiplexed and still be within BDA
specifications.

One point to remember is that video source files formatted in 12- to 16-bit 4:2:0 colorspace
consume about one terabyte of disk space for 60 minutes of material. Compressing a file this
size takes a lot of time and finesse. Just encoding without reviewing and then re-encoding
segments can take five to twenty times realtime (1 minute could take 20 minutes to encode).
With viewings and re-encodes, the elapsed time for encoding can easily take a week or more
for a high end Hollywood title. As encoders are further optimized and workstation hardware
gets faster and cheaper, the time to get a great-looking encode will become  shorter and the
cost will become less.
720 or 1080?
High definition video comes in a number of frame sizes, including 1920×1080,
1440×1080 or 1280×720. Many broadcasters are using 720p, asserting that it looks better
than 1080i, which it may. But, in our opinion, true HD is defined as 1080p, meaning
1920×1080 pixels, progressive usually at 24 fps or 23.976 fps. Review all of your content and
ensure that it is of the highest resolution and, hopefully, all the same resolution. Mixing
frame sizes and frame rates, although possible using separate playlists (you cannot mix reso-
lutions within a playlist), will result in some very unpleasant user experiences. When the play-
er is set to pass through the video (with no upscaling), the BD player and the monitor will re-
sync every time the resolution changes. The re-sync can take anywhere from half a second to
more than five seconds.
50 Hz or 60 Hz?
The BD specification allows for 25 and 50 Hz frame rates for players sold in countries with
50 Hz power. If you develop content for 60 Hz (e.g., 25 or 50 fps) then the material will most
likely not play back in players that are sold in 60 Hz power system countries. 60 Hz content
(29.97, 30, or 59.94 fps) will play back on all displays. So to make things simple, use either 24
fps (film frame rate) or 30/60 fps when creating or preparing content.
PCM or Dolby Digital or DTS? 
With Blu-ray, DTS is the preferred audio codec due to its optimal balance of file size and
sound quality. If you have the bandwidth or disc space, multi-channel PCM is feasible and
appropriate for titles that will be appreciated by audiophiles. The Dolby Digital audio for-
mat is still quite a good format as well and streams that were prepared for DVD can be used
with BD. Every BD player, including computer based software players, can play PCM, DTS,
and Dolby Digital audio tracks. The lossless audio codecs and PCM do not leave much room
for video, so remember to do both disc space budgeting (bit budgeting) as well as bandwidth
budgeting. Special encoding software may be required for the advanced forms of the DTS
and Dolby codecs. PCM is pretty straightforward and is a widely-compatible format that can
be output from most audio editing tools.
Multiregion and Multilanguage Issues
Unlike with DVD, where you had a region declared for the entire disc, with BD, you can
program the disc to check the region on a title by title basis (e.g., each playlist can have dif-
ferent region settings). Also, note that the regions for BD are different than for DVD. There
are only three BD regions — A, B, and C.

If you decide to use regional management, then you need to decide which regions. Again,
broadening the scope of the disc early may be a lifesaver later, when marketing plans become
more ambitious. Table A.1 lists what regions apply to which countries. You must also decide
on menu languages, and choose which audio languages and which subtitle languages to put
on the disc. Carefully check the audio and subtitle tracks to make sure they synchronize to
the video you are using. In many cases, an existing audio dub or subtitle set may be from a
different cut of the movie, and will have to be modified or redone to match the cut you are
using. Audio from film usually has to be sped up (approximately 4 percent) for 50 hz video,
so make sure the audio properly matches the video.
If you cover multiple regions, or even if you only cover a single region such as
Europe/Japan, you may need to consider certification. Each country has its own require-
ments for classifications and certification. A disc with a “children’s” rating in one country
may end up with a “teen” rating in another country. If you have to cut scenes to get a par-
ticular classification, you will have to deal with conforming the audio and any subtitles to the
revised edit. The parental management features usually will not work. The classification
boards rate a work according to all the versions on the disc, regardless of how you have
restricted access to them.
You must also decide if you want a single package (often called a SKU — stock-keeping
unit) or multiple packages for multiple regions. In some cases, creating multiple SKUs is eas-
ier, since you can concentrate on making each version appropriate for its region rather than
trying to make a single version work everywhere. For example, you might want to make three
versions of a disc for release in Europe — one for the UK and Ireland, one for Germany and
Scandinavia, and one for central and southern Europe (France, Spain, Italy, and so on).
Multiple SKUs can also help with legal restrictions concerning how soon the home video ver-
sion can be sold or rented after theatrical release.
Regardless of the number of regions, if you expect to use more than one language on the
disc, especially for menus, keep all the graphic and video elements as language-neutral as
possible. Keep text separate from graphics so it can be easily changed for other languages.
Use subpictures, including forced subpictures, to put text on video, rather than permanently
setting the text into the video. Keep in mind that American English is different from British
English regarding usage and spelling. Likewise there are differences between American
Spanish and Castillian Spanish, between Canadian French and continental French, between
Brazilian Portuguese and Portugal Portuguese, and so on. In all cases, check to ensure that
you have proper rights for the content. A particular work may have only been licensed for
distribution in one country, or a foreign language audio dub may be restricted for use in cer-
tain countries.
Persistent Storage
In BD-J mode, you have access to Persistent Storage on the player. This area is not avail-
able with HDMV mode programming.
Persistent storage, which can be either the application data area (APDA) or the binding
unit data area (BUDA), is used for storing information or content for the disc that does not
get lost when the disc is ejected or the player stopped or shut off, and that is available to the

user from one time to the next when using a disc. In your production process, you want to
address a couple of things. First, you need to ensure that you have assigned an Org_ID and a
Disc_ID for each disc. These values define where the information is stored in the player. You
will also need to address how to delete old information or data as the space is limited.
The BUDA is the area of persistent storage where content, including program code, is
stored and invoked via the virtual file system (VFS). Plan for how this area is used and how it
will work with your disc-unbound or title-unbound application(s).
All profile players, 1.x and 2.0, support the APDA storage. Be aware, though, that the
APDA is only specified to be a minimum of 64 Kbytes which means that that is the maximum
size you can count on being available. This area is shared by all discs that are played on the
player, so you want to use and share the space in a friendly and efficient way.
The BUDA is supported only on Profile 1.1 and 2.0 players. The space is a minimum of
256 Mbytes for Profile 1.1 players and 1 Gbyte for Profile 2.0 players. Many players allow the
user to expand this space with external devices such as USB flash or hard disk drives. You
need to address in your design and implementation that this space varies in size and can be
removable. If there is no BUDA storage at all then you may want ot prompt the user to insert
a storage device (such as a USB stick). If there is storage but it is filled up you may want to
display a message, e.g., “Please clear storage and try again...”. Again, you need to use this
area in a friendly way with other discs. Data and content from the same content provider can
be shared but cannot be accessed by other discs unless authorized. You may want to include
a utility in your disc to allow the viewing and deletion of the content that you have stored
here.
Network-Connected Features — BD-Live
Including network-connected features on a disc means that you have several items that
need to be addressed in the design and implementation of these titles. When a disc is access-
ing the network, be sure to check —
1. Is the player Profile 2.0 capable? 
2. Is the player connected to the Internet?
3. Is there updated content on the server?
4. Does the connection have the bandwidth to complete the download (or upload)
in a reasonable time? A one gigabyte file (about 5 minutes of HD video and
audio), could take about 45 minutes at 3 Mbps.
5. Can the download be restarted if the connection is interrupted?
6. Is there enough space available on local storage for any files that you will down-
load into APDA or BUDA?
7. Can the server and the infrastructure handle the volume of concurrent users and
the required bandwidth to support their interactivity and downloads?
For development and testing prior to shipment, you may need to set up a test environment
that mimics what endusers will experience in terms of connection speed, interruptions and
player capabilities. This is to test not only what will ship on the disc, but the backend infra-
structure needed to support the endusers.

BD-Live opens up the possibility for discs that are never “finished”. They can evolve over
time for both content and functionality. Not only can the content be updated, but the pro-
gramming code can also be updated. The updates can not only add new functionality/features
but update/fix code anomalies. It is conceivable that at some point all discs will ship with a
BD-Live capability if for no other reason than to update the programming code on the disc.
With the right planning and backend infrastructure, all discs can be fixed after they have
shipped. (Don’t you wish you had that capability on DVD???)
Supplemental Material
One of the great appeals of BD is that a disc can hold an incredible variety of added con-
tent to enhance the featured program. Being able to watch a movie a second time and listen
to the comments of the director, writer or actors gives viewers a deepened appreciation for
the movie and for the filmmaking process. Adding more video, audio, graphics, and text
information can greatly enrich a disc. Anyone producing a BD should consider how the prod-
uct can be enhanced with supplements; not just because it is neat or expected, but to truly
improve the viewing experience. The following list provides some examples of added content
for BD. Some types of added content, especially text and information that can become out
of date, are best delivered using network connected capabilities of BD-Live. Any of this con-
tent could be accessed in a BD-Live mode. The more likely BD-Live content is indicated with
an asterisk (*):
j Multiple languages and subtitles, menus in other languages
j Biographies: information about actors, directors, writers, and crew, describing
careers, influences, and other interesting data*
j Filmographies: information about actors, directors, writers, and crew describing
previous films, acting experience, awards, and current projects*
j Commentaries: audio or subtitle commentaries from people who worked on the
film, people who have studied the film, people with historical information, and
even fans
j Song list: a chapter index to all the songs on the soundtrack
j Backgrounders: historical context, timeline, important details, related works*
j “Making of” documentary
j Production notes and photos, behind-the-scenes footage, lobby cards, memora-
bilia
j Live production details, such as synchronized storyboards, screenplay, or pro-
duction notes*
j Trivia quiz or game
j “Easter eggs:” hidden features that are found by selecting disguised buttons on
menus
j Related titles: “If you liked this disc, you should see...,” lists or previews of discs
with similar characteristics or with the same actors. For BD-Live discs, this
could include discs that have been released after the initial release of this disc.*
j Trailers or ads for other titles

Scheduling and Asset Management
The secret to a smooth and successful project is a carefully-monitored production sched-
ule. The schedule enables you to allocate resources and determine bottlenecks. Project plan-
ning software such as Microsoft Project is very helpful. In many cases you will start with a
rough high-level schedule, then create an updated schedule based on the detailed project
tasks. More so than with DVD production, BD projects can have many activities that are con-
current. For example, after the title has been designed and architected, compression and
multiplexing can be happening in parallel with the graphics creation and the BD-J program-
ming. This concurrency is especially important where there are complex interactive elements
that require extensive programming to implement. Some of the programming of the interac-
tive elements may be created before other assets of a title are even conceived. For example,
features such as a progress bar with bookmarks and user-defined playlists may be created and
completed even before the rest of the disc content is complete.
Throughout the production process, keep track of the assets. Make a list of each asset,
when it is due, when it arrived, what format the source is in, when it was digitized and encod-
ed and by whom, what the filename is, where the files are stored, when the client signed off
on each stage of asset conversion or production, and so on. Clarify who owns the copyright
for new content that may be created during production.
Project Design
A project design document is the blueprint from which everyone will work; it is the impor-
tant first step for creating a disc. Decide upfront the scope and character of your title. Make
a plan and try to stick to it. Authoring is a creative process, but if you continually change the
project as it goes along, you will waste time and money. Determine the level of interactivity
you want. The more interactive the project, the more complex the layout and, thus, the more
time you need to spend at an early stage.
Laying out the disc generally involves the following —
Production Essentials

j Flowchart Diagram each part of the title. Decide what appears when the disc is
first inserted. Does the disc go straight to a video element or to a menu? Diagram
each menu and how it links to other menus and video segments. For a complex
title, unless you create a clean design with clear relationships between the various
hierarchical levels, your viewers will become lost when trying to navigate the disc.
Each box on the flowchart should indicate how the viewer will move to other boxes
and what keys or menu buttons they will use to do so (Figure 12.1).
Production Essentials

Blu-ray Disc Demystified
Figure 12.1  Sample Disc Flowchart

j Storyboard Draw pictures of the menus and the video segments. You may want to
draw a storyboard picture for each chapter point. Make sure that transitions
between menus and from menus to video are smooth.
j Prototype Create rough versions of the menus in PhotoShop, PowerPoint or anoth-
er graphics program. Simulate jumping from one menu to another by using layers
or by opening new files. Bring in other people to test the simulation. Make sure the
experience is smooth, clear, and easy. Adobe Flash is another tool that can be used
to create the menu interactions and the animations.
j UOP controls For every menu and video segment, determine what the user will be
able to do. Start with all user operations enabled, and only disable them for a good
reason. Do not needlessly frustrate your viewers by restricting their freedom.
Specify user operation results.
j If you have a dual-layer disc You will need to plan the layer break point with your
compressionist so that the layer change is seamless.
The layout process serves as a preflight check to make sure you have accounted for all the
pieces and that they work together. Good layout documents provide a roadmap to be used
by the entire team throughout the remainder of the project — a checklist for coordinating
assets and schedules, a framework for menus and transitions, a guide for bit budgeting, an
outline for the authoring program, a checklist for testing, and so on.
Many authoring systems attempt to provide layout and storyboarding tools in the applica-
tion. Some succeed better than others. In general, at least a basic layout should be done on
paper or in a separate program, such as Adobe Flash, before jumping into the authoring
process, especially since the authoring stations are often key pieces of expensive equipment
that are in constant demand.
Menu Design
Menus make the disc; they set the tone and define the user experience. They are also fun
to design. The possibilities are endless, so you must make many decisions up front. Do you
want still menus or animated menus? If you have an animated menu, consider whether to use
animated graphics or a pre-composited video or a combination of both. If you are using
video, carefully consider how to design the video so that it loops smoothly. If a great deal of
movement occurs, consider starting with a still and ending with the same still. Fade the audio
down just before the end, and fade it back up at the beginning.
Do you use only popup menus or a combination of full screen and popup menus?
Consider the best way to allow the user to have logical interactions with the disc. Sometimes
full screen, DVD-like menus are more appropriate for the content than a popup menu.
What kind of animated transitions make sense? For full screen menus, can you use a video
or animated segment that appears at the beginning of the main menu, or between menus and
video segments? Make sure the transitions are smooth and appropriate. Even if you do not
use motion transitions, jumping from one design and color scheme to a completely different
one can be very jarring. HDMV and BD-J mode programming both support animations for

both popup and for full screen menus that are much more flexible and dynamic than pre-ren-
dered, video-based animations. When using full screen menus, jumping from one type of
audio codec in the menu to a completely different type of audio codec in the video program
can be grating.
Do you want background or button audio in the menu? Be very careful with this. One of
the most obnoxious features of BD discs are menus with audio that is too loud and too intru-
sive. Drop the audio to a pleasingly low level; then cut the level in half. Provide a way for the
user to turn off any background or button sounds. Play your menus sounds at least 20 times
in a row to discover just how annoying your creation can be.
Do you want multilanguage menus? If so, keep the text separate from the graphics and
video so that it can be easily changed for each language version of the menu. If you are cre-
ating the original backgrounds in English, leave 30 percent more space for translations.
Will you use animated buttons? Consider that each state of a button needs to be either a
separate PNG or programmed/authored. The number of graphic assets can be huge.
Do you want to idle out? That is, do you want the menu to automatically jump somewhere
else after a particular amount of time? If so, choose a long timeout period. Make sure the
menu does not time out while the viewer is still reading it. You may want the menu to time-
out to a screen saver to save from any burn-in on monitors.
Menu Creation
Menus are much more dynamic with BD than with DVD. Instead of a graphic layer that
defines a background and a subpicture layer for the highlight states of buttons, each button
and its associated highlight states are separate graphics. These graphics are often stored as a
set of graphic PNG files. These PNGs are then composited realtime onto the graphics plane
by the player (see Figure 12.7, presented at the end of this chapter).
A large part of the BD menuing experience is the use of animation. There are a number
of ways to create the animations, either with a set of PNG files to represent each state of the
animation or via movement of graphical areas or programatic calculations that either expose
areas (such as a progress bar) or a programmatic scaling of a graphic or other creative ren-
dering.  The challenge in BD-J mode programming of the menus is that the player speeds
vary significantly so that an animation sequence on one player may take seven seconds while
on another less than a second. Animations need to be tested to ensure that the user has a
desirable, pleasant experience on the player they are using. With BD, a highlight state may
be represented with a series of PNGs that animate a button to indicate that it has the focus.
Menus can be full screen for the top level menu as well as popup menus that appear over
the video. Creating the menu experience means that you need to address what is happening
on all the planes, e.g., the background plane, the video plane and the interactive graphics
plane. Creating the best user experience means taking advantage of the best capabilities of
each of these planes. An animation can be either programmed or it could be also composit-
ed into the video plane. There are many more creative choices than with DVD.
Remember that you also have sounds that can be associated with button presses or the ani-
mations or randomly.

One other consideration is the space that the graphics will use in the graphics buffer.
HDMV has a 16 Mbyte limit and is restricted to 8-bit indexed graphics. Careful planning and
creative authoring make this a workable framework but many large graphical elements will
quickly consume the graphic buffer and cause a menu design to be very difficult or impossi-
ble to implement.
With BD-J mode programming, the graphics buffer is 45.5 Mybtes for Profile 1.x players
and 65.5 Mbytes for Profile 2.0 players. But these are 24-bit graphics with an (optional) 8-bit
alpha channel. Good planning and clever programming will allow the creation of a great
interactive experience. BD-J has the capability to dynamically load/unload graphic assets so
this can be less of a restriction than with HDMV, although without proper implementation,
the load/unload activity can cause the video playback to stutter.
When you lay out a menu, consider interbutton navigation. The user has four directional
arrow keys to use in jumping from button to button. Lay out the menu so that it is obvious
which button will be selected when a particular arrow key is pressed. At the same time, do
not forget that your disc inevitably will be played in a computer with a mouse interface, so do
not rely on the user moving sequentially from button to button. In general, it is best to have
button links wraparound, so when the user presses the down key on the bottom button, the
top button should be selected. When the user presses the up arrow key on the top button, the
bottom button should be selected, likewise for left and right movement. The reasoning is that
it is better to have a keypress do something than nothing. The brief confusion experienced
by novice users when the arrow key functions wraparound is preferable to the angry frustra-
tion of users who expect arrows to wrap when they don’t.
Tips and Tricks
The following will help in creating your menu and animation graphics —
j If you use button sounds, provide a way to turn them off. It is easy to go from being
entertaining to annoying.
j A user should be able to tell within less than two seconds which button is high-
lighted. The number one mistake that BD and DVD menu designers make is fail-
ing to differentiate between a highlighted and an unhighlighted button. For exam-
ple, the viewer sees a screen with two buttons — one is yellow, one is green. Which
one is highlighted? If the user presses an arrow key, the yellow button turns green
and the green button turns yellow. The user still cannot tell which one is high-
lighted. This can even be confusing with more than two buttons if some of the but-
tons are different colors in their unhighlighted state. In many cases, it is better to
put a box or a circle around a button, or have an animated icon or pointer appear
next to it, rather than only changing the color or the contrast.
j  Make sure the highlighted color is different enough from the unhighlighted color
so that button selections are visible. Do not rely on menu simulation in the com-
puter because the highlights will appear different on different resolution HD mon-
itors.

j  Each menu should pre-highlight the button that the user is most likely to select;
this is called the “default” selection for any given menu. For example, if the main
menu is shown before the feature, the play button on the menu should be prese-
lected so the user can simply press Enter or Play to start. This is especially impor-
tant since the Play key on most remote controls does the same thing as the Enter
key when on a menu. Beginning DVD users will intuitively press the Play key when
they reach the first menu.
j Author menus so that the button that takes the viewer out of the menu is high-
lighted upon return. If a video segment or another menu jumps to a menu, the but-
ton that returns the viewer to where they just came from should be highlighted.
Note that this is a user interface design decision. There may be cases where you
want the highlighted button to advance from the button for segment A to segment
B as the user watches each video segment.
j
Design your menus for numerical access. Each button on a menu is internally
assigned a button number in programming, and many remote controls enable the
user to press the 1 through 9 keys on a menu to directly choose a button. Arrange
the buttons in proper numerical order. Be careful with invisible buttons. On a disc
with several menus and complex navigation, consider putting a number next to
each button.
j An introductory video sequence for the main menu will become a flaming irritant
if the user has to sit through it every time they return to the menu. Use the intro
for initial play only, then stifle it for later menu accesses. With persistent storage,
it is possible to have this behavior carryover from one play of the disc to another.
j Animated menus can be enjoyable, but keep them short and sweet; never make
animations longer than two seconds. When creating the animations, play them
over and over and imagine yourself pressing a menu button each time the video
loops. If it seems like a long time between button presses, then it is too long a time.
j HD video is 16:9, but when using 4:3 SD mode video, you may need to create
another set of menus for when the monitor is in SD mode. Downscaled HD menus,
often do not look pleasant and are difficult to read in standard definition.
j Make sure the button highlight/selection rectangle is over the top of the button art
in the background. If you put the rectangle somewhere else on the screen, the disc
will still work with the arrow keys but the button will not work when a computer
user clicks it.
j Doublecheck that button graphics are properly aligned on a 1920×1080 monitor.
It is easy to misalign a graphic if you use a less than full HD monitor in your pro-
duction workflow.
j  Temper creativity with good user interface design. Weigh functionality over aes-
thetics and experimentation. Frustrated users will head for the eject button and
will never see your avant-garde designs.

Navigation Design
Navigation is one of the hardest aspects of Blu-ray Disc production to get right. In addi-
tion to the confusion of having a TOP Menu key, a Pop-UP Menu key, and the inconsisten-
cy of navigation on different discs, it is difficult to balance creativity and playfulness against
ease of use. And, please note, selecting Top Menu will often require a reload of the BD-J
code and resources, depending on the player. The time to reload the Top Menu functionali-
ty can vary from less than ten seconds to well over 2 minutes depending on the player and
the size of your graphics.
When you create the flowchart, identify the effect of important menu keys for each menu.
Clearly indicate where the viewer will go when they press Top (Top Menu), Pop-Up Menu, or
Return (GoUp). If you have several menus, use a hierarchical design that the user will be able
to intuitively understand. If you use more than three levels in your hierarchy, try combining
menus to flatten the structure. However, try not to have more than seven to ten buttons on
each menu in order to avoid overwhelming the user with options. Keep all selectable features
and options as close to the main menu page as possible, with a minimal number of button
selections. Make it as easy to navigate back up through menus as it is to navigate in the down
direction.
Understand the difference between the Top (Title) key and the Menu key. “Top” means
“take me to the very top, to the table of contents.” “Menu” means “take me to the most
appropriate menu for where I am.” For multilevel menu structures, the Menu key can be
used to go up one level, or the Return key can accomplish this feature. A well-designed disc
will program the Return (GoUp) function to act somewhat like the back button on a Web
browser. Each time the viewer presses Return, they move up one level until they reach the top
(see Figure 12.2). Every remote should include the three basic navigation keys — Top (Title),
Menu, and Return. Take advantage of the intended function of each button (Figure 12.3).1
Always enable navigation with on-screen buttons as an alternative to relying on remote
control keys. Assume that the viewer has only the directional arrow keys and the Enter (OK)
key, or assume that the viewer has only a mouse. Make sure that buttons labeled back or
main menu or something similar are included to enable the viewer to navigate through all the
menus without relying on any other keys.
Figure out where each chapter point will be. Anywhere the viewer might want to jump to
should be a chapter point. Identify the chapter points by timecode on the storyboard or flow-
chart. Do this before the video is encoded, since each chapter entry point in the video must
be encoded as an I-frame at a GOP header.

1Unfortunately, some player interfaces, especially on computers, leave out the Top (Title) key or the Return
key. However, the incompetence of some player designers should not cause you to castrate your disc. The
more discs there are that properly use the navigation keys, the sooner players will be fixed to provide them
all. In the meantime, you can overcome the problem by providing on-screen buttons for navigation. See the
following paragraph.

Tips and Tricks
The following tips may assist your efforts to make user navigation easier and clearer —
j If you are going to use multiple BD-J or HDMV titles, you might want to give
the user some indication that there will be some delay before the next title/mod-
ule is loaded. A black screen that is displayed for more than a couple of seconds
gives the user the impression that something is broken, especially if you did not
warn them. 
j If you only have one menu, you may want to disable the Top Menu key as this
will fully reload the disc which, as previously noted, can take minutes on some
players.

j You should not disable the Top Menu or the Popup Menu keys if you have both
menu sets available.
j Do not author the disc so that pressing the Top Menu (Title) key starts over and
forces the viewer to watch logos and FBI warnings again. You can store the
information in either the application data area or in the player registers
(GPRMs).
j Make sure the Next and the Previous keys always work. At minimum, they should
move through chapters.
j Consider placing a “How to use this disc” element on every disc you make. It
can explain the basics of your navigation when using the arrow keys, Enter, Top
Menu, Popup Menu, and Return.
j Keep in mind that not all player remotes present all of the keys, such as audio,
subtitle, or others on the remote. It is better to build these functions into the user
interface of the title. With BD-J, any key that might be on the remote can be
controlled programmatically and you can, therefore, create a more coherent
way to use the disc than trying to find a particular key on the remote.
Balancing the Bit Budget
Bit budgeting is a critical step before you encode the audio and video. You must determine
the data rate for each segment of the disc. If you underestimate the bit budget, your assets
will not fit and you will have to re-encode and re-multiplex. If you overestimate the bit bud-
get, you will waste space on the disc that could have been used for higher quality encoding.
However, be conservative — using less than the entire disc works, but exceeding its capacity,
even by a small amount, forces you to rework the project.
The idea is to list all the audio and video assets and determine how many of the total bits
available on the disc can be allocated to each. Part of the early bit budgeting process involves
balancing program length and video quality. Two axes of control exist — data rate and capac-
ity. Within the resulting two-dimensional space, you must balance title length, picture quali-
ty, number of audio tracks, quality of audio tracks, number of camera angles, amount of addi-
tional footage for seamless branching, and other details. The data rate (in megabits per sec-
ond) multiplied by the playing time (in seconds) gives the size (in megabits). At a desired
level of quality, a range of data rates will determine the size of the program. If the size is too
large, reduce the amount of video, reduce the data rate (and thus the quality), or move up to
a bigger capacity disc.
Once you have determined the disc size and the total playing time, maximize the data rate
to fill the disc, which will provide the best quality within the other constraints, such as the
maximum bitrate for video of 40Mbps. Note that increasing the bitrate above a certain
threshold will technically give better video or audio quality, but you may not see or hear the
difference. The added bits will only result in longer production times to copy and process the
larger filesizes.
Production Essentials

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

See Figure 12.4 to get an idea of needed disc sizes. A DVD-5 holds 15 minutes of the high-
est bitrate video to over 6 hours of video at the lowest practical rate. A BD-25 can hold 1.5
hours of high bitrate video to over 25 hours at the lowest bitrate. Of course, the video qual-
ity at the longer playing times would likely be for SD resolution sub-DVD quality video.
The easiest way to make a bit budget is to use a spreadsheet. One is included on the sam-
ple disc that comes with this book. For simple projects with only one video segment, use the
DVDCalc spreadsheet on the sample disc. Some authoring programs will calculate bit bud-
gets for you when you use their layout features.
To simplify calculations, keep track of sizes in megabits, rather than megabytes (see Table
12.3). Allow an overhead of 5-7 percent for control data and backup files which are added
during formatting and multiplexing. This also allows a bit of breathing room to make sure
everything fits on the disc.

In addition to fitting the assets into the available space on the disc, also make sure that the
combined data rate of the streams in a video program do not exceed the maximum data rate
(instantaneous bitrate) of 40.08 Mbps. Subtract the audio data rates from the maximum to
get the remaining data rate for video. Lowering the maximum data rate reduces the ability
of a variable bitrate encoder to allocate extra bits when needed to maintain quality.
A typical bit budgeting process for a disc with a single main video program, plus a few
ancillary segments, is depicted in Table 12.4.
Calculate the total bitrate and size of the main program’s audio tracks and subtitle tracks.
If there are additional video segments — animated logos, top menus with video backgrounds,
previews — calculate their sizes (including audio), and add them to the total size of the main
program’s audio and subtitle tracks. Still logos and copyright warnings should be authored as
timed stills, which have no impact on disc space. Subtract the total size of the ancillary mate-
rial from the disc capacity minus overhead. This gives the remaining capacity for the main
program.

Calculate the average video bitrate for the main program by dividing the remaining capac-
ity by the running time. Also, calculate the maximum video bitrate by subtracting the com-
bined audio and subtitle bitrate from 40.08 Mbps. These numbers will be set in the encoder
when compressing the video for the main program. Note that minor elements, such as, sub-
title tracks and motion menus, are usually so small that they often can be omitted from cal-
culations. If they were left out of the example in Table 12.4, the average data rate would come
out to 24.17 Mbps, which is close enough for budgeting purposes.
An alternative bit budgeting approach is to divide the disc capacity (in bits) by the total
running time of all segments (in seconds) to get the average data rate (in Mbps). Adjust up
or down for quality of different program elements, as needed. For each program, subtract the
combined data rate of its audio and subtitle streams to get a video rate. It is a good idea to
follow up by summing the sizes of each segment (including audio) to check that the total does
not exceed the disc capacity.
Tips and Tricks
The following list of tips will help you in balancing the bit budget —
j Don’t forget top menu videos and video based menu transitions, as well as logo
sequences.
j Don’t forget to leave room for any added computer-based content or for man-
aged copy files. A few programs or some HTML files are not worth worrying
about, but large multimedia applications and installer packages need to be
accounted for.
j Each camera angle increases the data; two camera angles double it, three angles
triple it, and so on (including the corresponding audio and subtitles). Reduce
the maximum data rate according to the number of angles (see Table 6.11).
j If you have two or more video segments that contain much of the same data,
consider using the seamless branching feature to combine the duplicated seg-
ments (but only if you have an authoring tool that supports the multistory fea-
ture).
j Still images take up so little space that you don’t need to include them in your
calculations unless you have dozens of them. Unless you are including more
than four subtitle streams, you may wish to omit subtitles from the calculations,
since the space they take up is negligible.
Asset Preparation
A typical project requires dozens, if not hundreds, of assets from a variety of sources. A
complicated project may require thousands (see Table 12.5). Each asset must be properly
prepared before it can be fed into the BD authoring process. The following sections cover
the details for preparing each type of asset.

Preparing Video Assets
The final quality of BD video is primarily dependent on four things — the condition and
quality of the source material, the visual character of the material, the codec used, and the
data rate allocated to the video during encoding. The better the quality of the source, the bet-
ter job the encoder can do. Always use the best quality source and insist on an uncompressed
file-based format, whenever possible. Tape-based material can be on HDCAM SR, D5-HD,
DVCPro-HD, or HDV, while some video material may be in AVCHD format. Keeping the
video in a digital format without conversion will help to ensure the best quality. Verify that
you have correctly identified all of the sources as 720p, 1080i, 1080p, or one of the support-
ed standard-definition resolutions.
If the project video is not all high definition, you may want to consider upconverting the
SD video to HD (1080p) to ensure that the viewer will have the highest consistent quality
video to view. Although the BD player and/or the monitor can upconvert the video, you no
longer have control over the quality of the conversion. The enduser's playback setup may do
a great job or a poor job. And, rest assured, the poor job will be perceived to be your fault,
not the player’s.

Tasks

If the video is of poor quality or contains noise, use some form of digital video noise reduc-
tion (DVNR) to improve it. Noise is random, high-entropy information, which is antithetical
to compression with AVC, VC-1 or MPEG-2 encoding. Efficient encoding depends on
reducing redundant information, which is obscured by noise. Noise can come from grainy
film, dust, scratches, video snow, tape dropouts, cross-color from video decoders, satellite
impulse noise, and other sources. It may also be intentional as a creative style. Complex
video, including high detail and high noise levels, can be dealt with in two ways — increase
the data rate or decrease the complexity. The DVNR process compares the video across mul-
tiple frames and removes random noise. After DVNR, the video compresses better, result-
ing in better quality at the same data rate. With HD video, many flaws in the image are
exposed that did not show up in even the best DVD productions.
If possible, keep the production path short and digital. A frequent irony of the process is
that video is edited on a computer, then output to an analog or digitally lossy tape format in
order to be encoded back into a computer file. If you use a digital nonlinear editing system
(NLE), look into options for directly outputting BD-compliant AVC, VC-1 or MPEG-2
streams. Most HD video is 16:9. If you are using other sourced material, such as, standard
definition video or film, anticipate the need for aspect ratio conversion. Make sure the vari-
ous sources are in the proper aspect ratio (4:3 or 16:9), especially for assets that need to be
edited together.
You may need to choose between variable bitrate encoding (VBR) or constant bitrate
encoding (CBR). VBR does not directly improve the quality, it only means that quality can
be maintained at lower average bitrates. For best quality of long-playing video, VBR is the
only choice. For short video segments, CBR set at or near the same data rate of VBR will
produce similar results with less work and lower cost. For VBR encoding, set the average and
the maximum bitrate as determined in the bit budgeting step. These will be largely deter-
mined by your choice of encoding, whether AVC, VC-1, or MPEG-2 and the encoder.
Tips and Tricks
The following tips will help you in preparing video assets —
j The display frame rate for high definition video can be 23.796, 24, 25, 29.97, 50,
and 59.94 fps. 25 and 50 fps video are only required in 50 hz video countries
(mainly the countries where PAL was the SD standard). True 30 and 60 fps are
not allowed.
j If utilizing secondary video (for PIP), the frame rate of the PIP video needs to
match that of the primary video — you cannot have 29.97 video, which may have
been previously used on DVD, as the PIP video on top of 24p primary video!
j BD supports different frame rates and frame sizes. Mixing and matching at the
end of a project will create results that are noticeable on HD monitors. Plan
ahead in production and in post-video production so that you have a good look-
ing master for the BD compression.
j Ensure that the encoder can produce BD-compliant streams, with proper GOP
size, display rates, peak bitrates, and so on. Also look for an encoder that can do
segment-based re-encoding, which enables you to re-encode small segments, as

needed, rather than reprocess hours of video to correct a small isolated prob-
lem. Not all MPEG-2, AVC (MPEG-4, part 10) or VC-1 streams are BD com-
pliant. For high profile projects that will be replicated, you will need to run the
multiplexed streams through a specification verifier to ensure that the streams
will be compliant to the specification, thereby ensuring the best playback com-
pability.
j If you are working with film transferred to video, make sure the workflow main-
tains the 24p framerate and progressive frame format.
j Chapters and programs must start at a sequence header or GOP header, and the
GOP must be closed, not open. Each cell must also start at a sequence header.
If you have very precise points for chapter marks, make sure they are encoded
properly, otherwise the authoring software may move the chapter point to the
nearest I-frame.
j Stills are encoded as I-frames using one of the video codecs (MPEG-2, AVC, or
VC-1) for either timebased or browsable slideshows. You can also use PNGs
that you can load/unload and control playback with BD-J code.
j Static video, where the picture does not change over time, such as FBI warnings,
logos, and so on, should be authored as a timed still. Not only does this look bet-
ter, with no movement or variation when played back, it can save space on the
disc.
j Make sure the video does not have burned-in subtitles. Use the BD subtitles
instead, particularly for multilingual discs. Even narrative subtitles can be better
displayed with BD subtitles. This will ease the localization of your disc.
j Presentation Graphics (PG)-based subtitles will look better than player-ren-
dered subtitles (termed TextST, for text subtitle). PG subtitles are 8-bits/pixel
with an indexed color palette which are multiplexed in the A/V stream. Each
player may render text fonts differently, so you will have more control of the
quality and the timing of the subtitles if you use the PG pre-rendered subtitle
approach. Subtitling software that creates the PG-based subtitles vary widely in
quality. Work with your software or service bureau to ensure that you have
great-looking subtitles. With HD resolution, subtitles can look great.
j If you want to pack a large amount of HD video on a disc, do not try to encode
to MPEG-2 under 12 Mbps. Use either SD video at 16:9 or use an AVC or a VC-
1 codec. The AVC or VC-1 codec will allow you to use a bitrate that is 20-40%
lower for the equivalent quality of a MPEG-2 encoded video stream. Before
encoding the video, use heavy digital video noise reduction (DVNR) and liber-
al application of blurring filters in video processing programs. These steps
reduce the high-frequency detail in the video, which makes MPEG encoding
more efficient. Also try reducing the color depth from 24 bits to something
between 16 bits and 23 bits. Do not use a dither process, which increases high-
frequency detail. This can help with encoding efficiency and can reduce poster-
ization artifacts.

j If video quality is a top consideration, create or request your content in pro-
gressive format if at all possible — shoot on film or use a progressive digital
video camera. If your video assets come from an interlaced source, consider
converting to progressive format before encoding. Depending on the nature of
the video, progressive conversion may cause artifacts that unacceptably degrade
the video. For some types of interlaced content, however, a high-quality pro-
gressive conversion will result in a BD that looks significantly better when
played on progressive BD players and monitors See Chapter 2 for more on pro-
gressive video.
Preparing Animation and Composited Video
Video produced on a computer or camera-source video that is composited with computer
graphics have their own sets of issues. Preview all of your video at the full resolution of
1920x1080. If you are working at lower resolutions than this, there will be artifacts that your
enduser may see. Conversely, preview your material at lower resolutions also. You may need
to decide which wreaks havoc on interlaced displays, even at 1080i. 720p displays will lose
some of the fine detail that you have at 1080p. Avoid thin horizontal lines; use the anti-alias-
ing and motion blur features of your animation or editing software, whenever possible. Use
a low-pass or a blur filter, but don’t overdo it because too much blurring reduces resolution
on progressive scan players and on computer displays.
For SD content, consider upconverting to 1080p. Although this will result in more disc
space being used, this ensures that the enduser will have the best consistently-displayed
video. If you need to use SD video — for 525-line (60hz) video, you can render animations
at 720x540 and scale to 720x480 before encoding; For 625-line (50hz) video, you can render
animations at 768x576 and scale to 720x576 before encoding, or if your software supports it,
render with D1 or DV pixel geometry. Render at 24 fps progressive as this will yield the best
looking video on high definition 1080p displays.
Player Rendered Animations and Compositions
With DVD, any animations had to be pre-rendered as video. You would then use these
pre-rendered clips as transitions between either still or motion menus. This technique still
has applications with BD, but most of the animations can be rendered by the player as the
user interacts with the disc. Some things to remember, though, unless the playback is on a
very fast player (e.g., Sony PS3), you need to pay attention to the number of pixels per sec-
ond that you are moving on the display at any one time. Keep the pixel rendering under
about a fifth of the screen size per second and you will not have tearing or stuttering on any
of the players. Test your animations to ensure that they work on the players that you have tar-
geted.
Preparing Audio Assets
Contrary to most expectations, audio is usually just as complex as video and often more
complex. You must deal with multiple tracks, synchronization, audio levels across the disc,
Production Essentials

Blu-ray Disc Demystified

and so on. As with video, the better quality the source, the better the results after encoding.
Audio assets usually come on modular digital multitrack (MDM) formats, or you may receive
PCM (WAV) files on a CD-R, DVD-R, BD-R or HDD, or already-encoded Dolby Digital
or DTS files. With a multitrack tape source, make sure the track-to-channel assignments are
correct. Dolby has specified that the sequence is L (left channel), R (right channel), C (cen-
ter channel), LFE (low frequency effects), Ls (left surround), Rs (right surround, Lt (left
total), Rt(right total), but not all production houses follow this standard.
Capture your audio mixes at the highest sample rate and word size possible. If someone
else is doing the audio mixing, request that they do the same. As recording and mastering
studios acquire the new equipment needed to work with high-resolution audio, 96 kHz 24-bit
audio will become commonplace. Unlike with DVD-Audio or for audio-oriented DVD-
Video, a 96 kHz 24-bit PCM audio track can have plenty of remaining headroom on BD.
When converting from NTSC or PAL video, or transferring from film, the audio may need
to be conformed to match the transfer imagery, preferably via a pitch shift to restore proper
pitch. If the audio is from a CD, it must be upsampled from 44.1 kHz to 48 kHz for BD. Many
audio files produced on PCs are also at 44.1 kHz.
Do all of the necessary processing before encoding — clean up and sweeten the audio, re-
mix and equalize, adjust phase, adjust speed and pitch, upsample or downsample, and so on.
Audio levels can be adjusted before encoding or, for Dolby Digital, they can be adjusted dur-
ing encoding by using the dialog normalization feature. If the mix was done for the theater,
re-equalize for the home environment. Establish consistent audio levels and equalization
throughout all of the audio on the disc, including menus and supplements. This is especially
important with multiple audio tracks from various sources, since the viewer will be able to
jump at will between them and will be bothered by inconsistencies in level or harmonic con-
tent. Resist the temptation of locking out the audio key on the remote control, which will
only annoy your viewers. Instead, get all of the sources to PCM format so they can be
matched and harmonized before being encoded.
Tips and Tricks
The following tips will assist you in preparing the audio assets —
j Make sure timecode is included with the audio so that it can be synchronized
with the video (and make sure the timecode for the audio actually matches that
of the video).
j It is almost always a good idea to mute the audio for a second or so at the begin-
ning of each segment. This ensures that the player (or receiver) does not clip the
audio as it begins the decoding process.
j If you are doing 7.1 or 5.1 channel, Dolby or DTS encoding, or using multi-
channel PCM tracks, test the downmix.
j If you do your own encoding, request a copy of the Dolby Digital Professional
Encoding Manual from Dolby Labs.

The Zen of Subwoofers
If you understand the proper use of the LFE channel, you belong to an elite minority. As
Dolby Labs has pointed out over and over, apparently with little success, LFE does not equal
subwoofer. All five channels of Dolby Digital are full range, which means they are just as
capable of carrying bass as the LFE channel. Most theaters have full-range speakers, and do
not need separate subwoofers since most of the speakers have a built-in subwoofer. In the
home, it is the responsibility of the receiver or the subwoofer crossover to allocate bass fre-
quencies to the subwoofer speaker. This is not the responsibility of the BD player (unless it
has a built-in 5.1 channel decoder) or of the engineer mixing the audio in the studio.
The LFE channel is heavily overused in most audio mixes. A case in point is a certain
famous movie released on laserdisc with Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks in which the booming bass
footsteps of large dinosaurs were placed exclusively in the LFE channel. When downmixed
for two channel audio systems, the bass was discarded by the decoder, leaving mincing, tip-
toeing dinosaurs; this was not the fault of downmixing or the decoder. It could have been
fixed by a separate two-channel mix, but it also could have been fixed with a proper 5.1 mix
or a proper 5.0 mix. Had the footsteps been left in the main five channels, which are all full
range, the bass effects would have come through properly on all home systems.
Dolby Digital decoders ignore the LFE channel when downmixing. This is because the typ-
ical stereo or four channel surround system does not have a subwoofer. Again, this does not
mean that the LFE channel represents the subwoofer, only that the extra “oomph” intended
to be supplied in the LFE channel is inappropriate and could muddy the audio. Dolby Digital
decoders all have built-in bass management2, which directs low-frequency signals from all six
channels to the subwoofer, if one exists. Therefore, the LFE channel should be reserved only
for added emphasis to very low frequency effects such as explosions and jets.3
As illustrated by the tiptoeing dinosaurs, moving low-frequency audio to the LFE channel
does not make the soundtrack better in the home environment. This mistaken approach is
what has caused complaints about the LFE channel being omitted in downmixing. Nothing
important in a film soundtrack, including low-frequency audio, should ever be moved out of
the main five channels. Isolating low-frequency audio in the LFE channel does not remove
any sort of burden from the center and main speakers since the built-in bass management
already does this.
It’s possible to mix all “subwoofer sounds” without an LFE channel at all. Some theatrical
releases are mixed this way. Such a mix will play the same in 5.1 channel home theaters as in
cinemas, since the decoder and receiver automatically route the bass to the speakers that can
best reproduce it. The .1 channel is present only for an extra kick that the audio engineer
might decide should only appear in full 5.1 audio systems.

2Most A/V receivers support the ability to disable all post processing, including bass management. It some-
times has names like, “Pure audio mode” or “Direct mode”. If a consumer has all their speakers configured as
“full range” , this will usually bypass all bass management.
3Roger Dressler, Technical Director for Dolby, has remarked that the LFE channel should be renamed as the
“explosions and special effects” channel in order to avoid confusion.

Slipping Synchronization
An occasional problem with BD is lack of proper synchronization between the audio and
the video). Players are, sometimes, partly to blame for the problem but steps can be taken
during production to keep synchronization tight.
Check the timecodes on the audio to make sure they are correct. A handy trick for testing
audio sync, especially when no timecodes exist and it has to be aligned by hand, is to bump
the audio track forward several frames, check playback, bump it back several frames from the
original position, and check playback again. If moving it one direction had little or no effect,
while moving in the other direction had a very big effect, chances are that the original posi-
tion was not optimal.4 Further, make sure the master print was not incorrectly dubbed before
being transferred to video.
If sync steadily worsens, check to see if non-drop timecode is being used on the audio mas-
ter. The difference between 29.97 and 30 fps will slowly move the audio out of sync with the
video. Also make sure the film chain in the telecine machine is run at the proper video speed.
If sync suddenly changes, suspect a slip during a reel change in the telecine process or an edit
in the NLE system, independent of the audio.
Preparing Subtitles
Subtitles can be prepared graphics, like with DVD, or they can be text that is rendered by
the player. Graphics or text subtitles are presented on top of the video using the Presentation
Graphics plane, and behind any Java graphics (which are in the Interactive Graphics plane).
Subtitles are basically the timed display of a text file or a graphic. The possible uses for
subtitles are endless. They can expand and alter existing video, emphasize regions on the
screen, cover or censor, tint the video a different color, add a logo bug, and so on.
A handy feature of subtitles is that they can be forced to appear under program control.
This is especially useful for multilanguage discs because the video can be clean and the sub-
title can be made to appear in the appropriate language during playback of the disc.
Subtitles can be used to create limited animation overlaying the video. A graphic subtitle
rate of 15 frames per second is the practical limit for many players, although anything faster
than 2 per second may cause problems on some players. Lowering the maximum data rate
for the other streams that are present can help avoid problems. Likewise, using simple pic-
tures that encode more efficiently than large, complex ones can make all the difference.
Effects such as fade, wipe, and crawl can be performed by the player. Good subtitling soft-
ware will be able to add the display commands needed to create these effects.
Tips and Tricks
The following tips will assist you in preparing subtitles —
j Subtitles cannot cross chapter points or mark IDs.
Production Essentials

1 2 - 3 3
Blu-ray Disc Demystified
4When using this trick, keep in mind that synchronization problems in audio delayed behind the video are less
perceptible than in audio that precedes the video.

j Pre-rendered subtitles (graphic subtitles), need to be rendered for HD as
Presentation Graphics (8-bit indexed palette graphics) and setup for a
1920×1080 display. SD subtitles that were made for DVD will look low resolu-
tion and aliased when attempting to reuse for HD.
j Subtitles that will be rendered by the player (TextST) are limited to 25-50 char-
acters per second (cps). You may have to adjust/edit the dialog and/or transla-
tions to meet this rate. Graphic based subtitles do not have this cps limitation.
Subtitling, particularly creating foreign language subtitles, is a tricky job best given to a
subtitling house. Provide the subtitling service with a proxy video copy that has clear audio
and burned-in timecode (BITC) that exactly matches the BD video master. This is critical for
frame-accurate subtitling work; timing is very important.
You may request that the subtitle source be provided in text form rather than graphic
form, as text is much easier to change, but text subtitles must then be turned into graphics
unless you are using player-rendered text. If you are using player-rendered text, the subtitling
house must use the same font as you will distribute on the disc. Please note that when you
distribute a font on a disc, you must either license the font (and pay the appropriate fee,
unless it is a free font) or create your own font. In most cases, you are better off using subti-
tles that have been pre-rendered to graphics.
If you are creating your own subtitles, consider the following —
j Don’t use serif fonts. Sans serif fonts are easier to read, as the serifs tend to cre-
ate single-pixel horizontal lines that produce interlaced twittering.
j Use a drop shadow or an outline, either black or translucent (using the alpha
channel of PNGs).
j Each new subtitle should appear at the scene change, not at the dialog start.
This provides more on-screen time, and studies show that it reduces reading
fatigue.
j Center the subtitles. If there is more than one line, left-justify the lines within
the centered position (or right-justify the lines for right-to-left writing systems).
Justifying the lines makes them easier to scan.
j Try to limit subtitles to two lines. Keep the first line shorter, which covers less
video and clues in the eye that there is another line.
j If there is more than one speaker, indicate speaker change with a hyphen at the
beginning of the line.
j Display subtitles for no less than one second and no longer than seven seconds.
j Keep in mind that jumping to the middle of a scene, or using fast forward or
rewind, will not refresh a subtitle. Subtitles with long periods will take a long
time to appear. To avoid this problem, you may wish to repeat the same subtitle
at intervals of five to ten seconds, if necessary.
j Proofread! With thousands of subtitles, especially in foreign languages, it is easy
for misspellings to occur.

Preparing Graphics
Graphics are much more granular for BD than with DVD. For BD, graphics can be creat-
ed for a full-screen menu, but graphics are also created for buttons, animation sequences
(such as load icons) and highlight/selector indicators. Graphics are also used for slideshows,
such as photo galleries and information pages. Graphics can be tricky and the traditional
tools for creating computer graphics are not always well suited for video-based graphics.
Colors
Graphics should be created in 24-bit mode. Choose RGB colorspace (or YUV colorspace,
if available) rather than CMYK or other print-oriented colorspaces. The file format should
be either PSD, PNG or JPEG. PNG is the basic format and it has an advantage over JPEG
in that it has an alpha channel. Whichever format(s) that you use is ultimately determined by
your authoring system or programming framework. Please be aware that JPEG compression
can cause artifacts that may be compounded by MPEG compression. If you must use JPEG,
choose the highest quality level that is compatible for BD. With Photoshop, for some odd rea-
son, this means choosing a quality level of 6 to ensure compabitility.
HD video uses the ITU-R BT.709 colorspace (RGB values in the 0-255 range). While any
SD mode video on a disc is ITU-R BT.601 colorspace (RGB values in the 15-235 range) and
saturated colors, especially bright reds and yellows, will "bleed" on the display. With a
1920×1080 display many, if not all, of the color issues that existed with DVD are gone. The
only thing to keep in mind is that there are multiple playback resolutions — 1920×1080,
1440×1080, 1280×720 and 720×480. Choose and then test the resolutions that you want to
support with your design. It is possible to use some very small fonts with the HD resolutions.
These fonts may not be readable on lower resolution monitors or at the viewing distance of
a user's display.
Image Dimensions
The pixel density of the image does not matter. Whether you use 72 dpi or 96 dpi or 300
dpi, what matters is the final pixel dimensions of the output. However, pixel geometry does
matter when using SD material. Most computer graphics programs use square pixels. SD
material on BD is based on the ITU-R BT.601 format that does not use square pixels. In
Photoshop, choose rectangular pixels for your SD graphics. For HD graphics, use square pix-
els (the default) and you're good. The screen size for HD is 1920×1080 pixels, so it is best to
work on a computer monitor that has at least this resolution so that you see an exact pixel
representation with no scaling.
Safe Areas
Most SD televisions employ overscan, which hides the edges of the picture. Overscan can
hide as much as ten percent of the picture. Two common safe areas are used to account for
this. The action-safe area defines a five percent picture perimeter as the guideline for the
outer boundary for action and important video content. The title-safe area defines a ten per-
cent picture perimeter as the guideline for the outer boundary for text and other vital infor-
mation (see Figure 12.5).

Figure 12.5  Video Safe Areas

Some programs have built-in video safe templates. In After Effects, for example, press the
apostrophe key to turn the safe area markers on and off. Most modern TVs do not have more
than 5 percent overscan, but older models may approach 10 percent. Computers, LCD or
plasma screens, and many video projectors have little or no overscan. Although, unless the
display is 1920×1080, you still need to account for action and title safe areas. Most often,
7.5% is a good allowance for action and title safe on the newer high definition displays.
Video Artifacts
Interlaced SD televisions are being replaced in large numbers around the world with the
move to HDTV, but as we have said before, not all HDTV monitors are created equal. You
may still need to address that your high definition Blu-ray Disc video might be displayed on
a non-progressive display, and therefore you must consider interlace artifacts. The funda-
mental problem is that as only every other horizontal scan line is displayed at a time, thin hor-
izontal lines will disappear and reappear 30 times a second. This interlaced twitter effect (also
called flicker) can be especially bad with computer-generated graphics. In addition to inter-
lace artifacts, chroma crawl and color crosstalk from composite video signals make thin lines
or sharp color transitions problematic, regardless of their orientation.
To reduce these effects, use the antialiasing and feathering features of your graphics soft-
ware, whenever possible. Make sure that all horizontal lines are at least two pixels wide. To
be even more careful, keep the thickness of horizontal lines at multiples of two pixels.
Use gradual color transitions instead of sharp contrasts between dark and light colors. To
adapt existing graphics, or as a final pass before encoding, apply a blur filter to the entire
image or to offending areas. For example, a Gaussian blur of 0.5 to 1 has little visual effect
but helps to reduce video artifacts. Also, because blurring reduces high-frequency detail,
compression will be more efficient, possibly resulting in higher quality.
Text is also affected by interlacing and other video artifacts. Small point sizes produce sin-
gle-pixel lines, which are bad, especially the horizontal lines created by serifs. Small text sizes
are also difficult to read from standard viewing distances. The smallest object that normal
human vision can discern subtends one minute of arc on the retina. Studies have shown that
for legibility, the height of a lower case character must subtend at least nine or ten minutes
of arc; more as the viewer moves off axis. ANSI standards recommend 20 to 22 minutes of
arc, with a minimum of 16 minutes. Angular measurements are independent of screen size.
This means, for example, that at a viewing distance of five feet, 21 minutes of arc equates to
0.37 inches, while at a viewing distance of 15 feet, 21 minutes of arc results in 1.10 inches. As
a rule, stick with 24 point or larger sizes. 14 point, bold text should be the absolute minimum.
Use antialiased text whenever possible.
Tips and Tricks
Here are a few tips that will help you in preparing graphics. Table 12.6 also provides some
guidelines to follow —

j Proofread all graphics before importing them into the authoring system. Don’t
rely on the graphic artist.
j If you work with clients, have them sign off on every graphic and menu before
the start of authoring.
Putting It All Together (Authoring)
Once all the assets are prepared and proofed, bring them into an authoring system and
knit them together. A variety of authoring paradigms are available. Some systems stick close
to the BD specification, while others try to hide terminology and details “under the hood” of
a graphical user interface (GUI). Most provide an onscreen flowchart, timeline, or a combi-
nation of the two. Large production environments may benefit from networked authoring
workstations, where each station focuses on a specific task (encoding, menu creation, asset
integration, simulation, formatting, and so on) and the project data flows from station to sta-
tion over a high-speed network.

At the authoring stage, specify basic parameters of the volume such as video format and
disc size. Import audio and video, synchronize them, and add chapter points. Then, appor-
tion titles and title sets. Create menus by importing graphics and subpictures, link buttons
together for directional highlighting, and link buttons to video segments or to other menus.
These are the essential authoring tasks. More complex projects require much more detailed
work.
Once everything is imported and connected, simulate the final product. Good authoring
systems can show menus, video, and audio, on-the-fly, giving a reasonable facsimile of how
the disc will look in a player. Take advantage of the simulation feature to test navigation and
overall layout before going further.
The authoring system is responsible for verifying compliance with the BD specification.
The better the authoring system, the better a job it will do of warning you when you have vio-
lated the spec. Better authoring systems will also provide information or warnings from the
“reality spec” — they will warn you about things that are allowed by the spec but may cause
problems on certain players. Some authoring systems also implement behind-the-scenes
workarounds to avoid known player deficiencies.
Region coding and CSS or CPPM flags may be added in the authoring system. In general,
the actual encryption is done by the replicator. This is the best option since the replicator will
have already executed a license and will have been given sets of disc keys and media key
blocks.
Tips and Tricks
The following tips will help you with the authoring process —
j Make sure you have more hard disk storage space than you think you could pos-
sibly need; BD assets are even larger than DVD and take up huge amounts of
space. The first time you have to suspend a project because of a bottleneck and
start work on a different project, you will be driven mad by the amount of time
it takes to backup a project from your RAID storage to near-line or off-line stor-
age, such as tape or hard disk. You may want to consider allocating a 1TB or
larger hard disk drive for each project.
j If you must do a layer change in the middle of the video, look for slow-moving
pictures, a still, or a fade to black. The secret to a smooth transition is low data
rate, which gives more time for the BD player to refocus on the second layer
before the buffer underflows. At the encoding stage, make the data rate as low
as possible for a few seconds going into the layer change, as well as a few sec-
onds coming out of the layer change. The players have buffers to make the layer
change undetectable even when there is motion in the video. This is not as crit-
ical for BD as it was with DVD.
Formatting and Output
Once the authoring, debugging and testing process is complete and everything works on
the Sony PS3 and your other targeted hardware players, it is time to create the final disc

image. The authoring system will add the assets together with the programming information.
The resultant fileset is stored in the BDMV directory. The multiplex is stored in the files under
these directories of the BDMV directory —
PLAYLIST
CLIPINF
STREAM
The following directories include the programming (including for BD-J) —
BDMV\AUXDATA
BDMV\BACKUP
BDMV\BDJO
BDMV\JAR
BDMV\META
CERTIFICATE
The AACS directory will be used when you create the final image for replication. 
Your debugging and testing process will have you re-creating these directories and files,
repeatedly. Unlike with DVD, you can simply replace the files that are updated and then test
again. If you are just updating the programming, you can use a multi-session BD-R/RE disc
to record the changed files. Recording just the changed files will saved a lot of time. Whereas,
a record of a full disc will take 45-90 minutes for a BD-25, a multi-session record with just
the changed BD-J code will take only 1-2 minutes. Plan on going through this step many,
many times as you debug and test your project on the various hardware players.
The data files can be used from a hard drive for use with a computer software player to
test for problems that do not show up when simulating the disc in the authoring system. 
Once everything is working perfectly, you will create a BD CMF image. This image file set
includes one file for each layer. The file set can be delivered to the replication factory either
via a fast, secure network connection or on hard disk drive.
Testing and Quality Control
Testing is the most important factor in the success of a project. If you work with clients,
quality control is vital to your reputation. Testing should never be left to the end; it must be
an ongoing process from the beginning. The BD players all have idiosyncracies that necessi-
tate testing on many players to ensure that the disc will work the way you intend. 
The first testing stage is source asset checking. Never assume that your supplier will get it
right. QC all incoming assets, at least until you have verified which suppliers you can rely on
to always get it right. Although it seems redundant and a drain on time and resources, it will
save you money and time in the long run. Screen all incoming assets for quality and accura-
cy. View every video source and encoded video file. Audition all audio files. View every
graphic file, checking for spelling mistakes and missing elements. If you cannot check foreign
language subtitles, make sure the supplier guarantees accuracy and takes responsibility for
costs associated with reauthoring the disc in case of subtitle errors. Check timecodes and syn-
chronization between audio and video and between subtitles and video.

Review video and audio during and after compression. Seamelss branching, if it exists in
the title, should be checked for smooth audio switching, as well. Check encoded audio
against the master to spot sync, level, and equalization problems. Check all text before it goes
to the graphic artist. Provide text to the graphic artist as text files that they copy and paste
(or otherwise import) into the graphics application. Do not let them type text — they always
misspell. If you work with clients, have the client proof and sign off on all the prepared assets
(video, audio, and graphics) before authoring. Check navigation, layout, and general func-
tionality as much as is supported by the simulation features of your authoring system.
After outputting the BDMV file set, do navigation testing with computer software players.
At this point, check whether the computer has reliable playback. Also be sure to check menu
functionality, since the mouse-based user interface changes the way things work. Software
player testing can catch errors before you spend the time and expense of writing a BD-R/RE. 
QC of video and audio, especially synchronization, is best done on hardware settop play-
ers. You will want to test on any target display types (CRT, LCD, DLP, et cetera), as well as
at 1920×1080 resolution and any other resolutions that you expect endusers to be using.
Although testing on a software player will help find and fix navigation issues, include test-
ing on hardware players early in the process. There is a vast difference in performance and
compatibility of the players (whether software- or hardware-based). You can choose a few
players to streamline your debugging process and then expand to a more comprehensive list
of players before finalizing the project. Reserve some of this matrix testing time for replicat-
ed check discs. Consider sending a BD-R to a verification service.
Check with your replicator, but many replicators will require that your final disc image has
passed a specification verification test. If you do not have this software in-house, consider
sending this to a BDA-approved testing center.
When you are sure everything works and complies with the specification, send the master
image to the replicator and request check discs. The check discs will require AACS encryp-
tion and the fees that go along with that process. Each master will require a new set of fees,
so do everything you can to ensure that the check discs have no surprises. Check discs are a
short replication run from the stamping master. A check disc is essentially the same as a final
mass-produced disc. If you approve the check disc, the replicator can use the existing master
for the full replication run. Most replicators include check discs as part of their replication
service charges. However, they will charge additional fees if you find errors and have to send
in a new master for another set of check discs. Unless you have thoroughly tested with BD-
R/REs and are comfortable with the potential of having thousands of shiny coasters at your
disposal, do not skip the check disc step.
Tips and Tricks
Table 12.7 and the following tips may help your testing and quality control to be more
effective and efficient —
j Test on a cheap TV, but also test on each of the display technologies — LCD,
DLP and Plasma (and maybe CRT). Most of the production process is done
with high-end, high-quality video equipment, but your customers could watch
your work on a cheap, old television or the latest 60-inch display. Make sure that
details of video and graphics, menu highlights, and so on are not lost on your

target user. Each of the display technologies has artifacts that may make your
work look terrible. Check your work beforehand so that there are no surprises.
j It is almost impossible to test all the permutations of a highly-interactive disc;
try to break things down into testable subsections. If you are using random func-
tions in your programming, you may want to do your testing folks a huge favor
and design in a way to bypass/configure them to allow easier QC of the disc.
j If you have computer software that can mount a formatted BD image file from
your CMF image on a hard drive, mount the volume for more thorough emula-
tion. This will find file system errors that normal emulation will not find.
j If you put computer applications or large amounts of computer data on the disc,
use a checksum program to verify the accuracy of the original data against BD-
Rs, CMF images, check discs, and final discs. A file-compare program such as
windiff is also useful for verifying filenames and data integrity. Be careful when
testing BD-Rs, as some BD-ROM drives have problems reading BD-Rs and will
report errors that will not be present on a check disc or the replicated copies.
j Although putting Macintosh files on the disc is not as much of an issue as it was
before Mac OS X, make sure that the icons display properly and that the appli-
cation bundle directory is still intact. The application bundle directory name will
show when viewing the disc under MS Windows or other operating systems.
j Most of the BD players can play BD-R/RE media. Use multi-session recording
mode to reduce the time it takes to record your test discs. Most often you are
only changing the programming which are small files (only a few megabytes) vs
the multiple gigabytes for the audio and video multiplex files which do not
change as much. This will cut your recording time from 45-90+ minutes to 30-
60 seconds.

Replication, Duplication, and Distribution
At this point, things are mostly out of your hands. Your BD CMF image delivery, repre-
senting weeks or months or years of your life, is in the hands of someone else. Most replica-
tors have excellent processes in place and will take good care of your project.
The replicator will use the BD CMF image to cut a glass master and make stamping mas-
ters. Some replicators first verify the BD CMF image formatting and check for specification
compliance. The replicator will send you check discs made from the master. Once you
approve the check disc, then thousands or millions of copies of your disc will be churned out.
If you want to serialize the individual discs with ID, tracking or serial numbers, or put
other custom information in the BCA, a small number of replicators have the necessary
equipment. If you need to make less than a hundred discs, you may want to use DVD-R or
BD-R duplication instead. You can burn DVD/BDs by hand, buy a DVD-R or BD-R bulk-
duplication system, or have a service bureau duplicate the discs.
Most replicators can do source tagging — inserting electronic article surveillance (EAS)
labels — into packaging. The two most popular source tagging technologies are acousto-mag-
netic tags from Sensormatic and RF tags from Checkpoint Systems.
If you need a rush job, schedule replication early, since large orders (especially things such
as Star Wars discs or Microsoft operating systems) can sometimes swallow all available repli-
cation capacity. Establishing a relationship with one or two replicators will help when you
have special demands.
Disc Labeling
Many options for disc labeling are available, such as silkscreen printing, offset printing, pit
art, and holograms. The area of a disc available for label printing normally extends from the
46 mm to the 116 mm diameter points (the data area runs from 48 mm to 116 mm). For spe-
cial applications, the print area can start at 34 mm, just past the clamping area. The BCA
area is at 44.6 mm to 47 mm, so discs that use the BCA must start the label at about 48 mm.

Check that subtitles appear at proper times. Make sure languages match
the language name displayed by the player.
Closed Captions

Make sure long filenames were not truncated and that special characters
are intact.
ROM data integrity
Verify readability of all files. (If there are errors with a BD-R, try a differ-
ent drive.) Verify file and directory counts as well as byte size comparison
with original file set. MD5 checksum comparisons can be used for key files.

Silkscreening applies layers of colored ink to the label side of the disc. If more than two
colors are used, or if the disc has large ink coverage areas, care must be taken that the disc
does not warp as the ink dries. Offset web printing causes fewer warping problems from ink
shrinkage than screen printing, but it is more expensive.
Pit art is produced by creating a stamper that embosses a graphic design onto the back sub-
strate. The black print of the source graphic will appear as a mirrored surface, while the white
areas of the graphic will appear as a frosted surface. The pit art area extends from 40 mm
diameter to 118 mm. The source graphic is a one-bit monochrome image, usually 2048×2048
pixels. Check with your replicator, as this option may not be available from your replicator.
Package Design
Packaging is the spokesperson for your disc. Make it reflect the contents of the disc and
grab the attention of the customer. Even with Internet shopping, the disc jacket influences
the buyer’s impression of the work.
Design with the collector in mind. Part of the reason people buy BDs rather than renting
them or taping them (or waiting for the network broadcast) is because they enjoy collecting.
Use quality artwork on the package. Produce an informative and enjoyable insert. Consider
including little goodies in the package that relate to the disc.
Explain what is on the disc. Do not assume that the customer is familiar with the contents.
Include a list of titles, chapters, extras, and so on. Use standard text and icons to indicate the
format of the contents. Clearly identify number and type of audio tracks, aspect ratio, disc
region, video format, running time, and so on (see Figure 12.6). Sometimes it is a good idea
to delay package design until the end because details of aspect ratio, soundtracks, extras, and
so on may change during production.

Production Maxims
For your edification and enjoyment, here is a small collection of maxims, reminders, and
rules of thumb — many of them learned the hard way — collected from various BD and
DVD authors —
j Entry points (chapters and mark items) must start at a GOP header and must
be at least 0.4 seconds apart.
j Corollary: An I frame is not necessarily a GOP header. To create an entry point,
you must force a GOP header, not just an I frame.
j Subtitles cannot cross an entry point (mark item).
j GPRMs are reset to zero on disc change (with title bound applications) or when
the player is stopped.
j Any amount of QC on a replicated check disc is worth more than the cost of pay-
ing for a disc run that failed for the simplest problem. If there will not be enough
time or budget to go through check disc testing, then you, above all others, need
to test the check disc.
j Last, but not least, no disc is ever easy, simple or trivial, and saying that it will be
usually guarantees that it won’t be.
BD-ROM Production
The following subsections go over a few of the basics of producing a BD for computers.
Also, see the testing section earlier in this chapter.
File Systems and Filenames
BD-Video discs use the UDF (Universal Disk Format) version 2.5 file system. This file sys-
tem does not include ISO 9660 and Micro UDF as with DVD-Video. A BD for computer
data may be formatted with any file system — UDF 2.0, ISO 9660, Windows NTFS, Apple
HFS, EXT2/3 and so on. However, many of the older file systems do not support volumes
greater than 4 GBytes or files larger than 2 GBytes or 4 Gbytes. UDF 2.5 solves many of

NOTE
Anyone who is serious about producing Blu-ray Discs should invest in most
of the following equipment —
j a 1080p 1920×1080 LCD monitor,
j a 1920×1080 Plasma display,
j a 720p LCD or Plasma display,
j an expensive 1920x1080p CRT monitor,
j a Blu-ray Recorder compatible PC, and
j a full audio playback setup with either 5.1 or 7.1 channels to be
able to properly preview the audio.

these problems and has been optimized for optical disc. UDF 2.5 can handle files up to 16
EiBytes and volumes in excess of 8 TiB which will handle even potential 20 layer 500 Gbyte
discs.
Not all operating systems can read the UDF 2.5 file system. For Windows you need Vista.
For WinXP, you need a special UDF 2.5 filesystem driver. For MacOS, you need 10.5 or later.
For Linux, depending on the distro, you need 2.6.26 or later. UDF 2.5 supports filenames of
up to 255 characters using the Unicode character set, which supports characters from almost
every language. However, an operating system has no guarantee that it will be able to cor-
rectly display a given Unicode character. The pathnames can be up to 1,023 characters.
If you need compatibility with older operating systems such as Windows 95, DOS, and
Unix that are unable to read the UDF 2.5 file system on BD volumes, you are probably bet-
ter off staying with DVD-ROM and using the older techniques such as implementing the
Joliet extensions to allow long filenames within the ISO 9660 file system.
In the final premastering step for replication, if this will be a data-only disc, you can deliv-
er a UDF 2.5 image file for a BD25 on a hard disk drive. For a BD50, you will need to pro-
duce a CMF image where each layer has its own image file. This is called a BDCMF type P
image. For a data-only discs (no BD-ROM video), AACS is not needed.
Bit Budgeting
Bit budgeting on BD data discs is a breeze compared to BD-ROM Video. You just add up
all the file sizes and see if they fit on a disc; however, a few potential pitfalls might arise.
Don’t forget the difference between billions of bytes and gigabytes. The operating system will
report file sizes in gigabytes, but BD capacities are usually given in billions of bytes. Don’t
forget to leave some room for the file system directory structure. When there are hundreds
or thousands of files, the file system overhead can be significant. Leave at least 4-7% for this
overhead. As a final check, for a BD25 disc, create a UDF 2.5 image file and make sure it is
less than 25×109 bytes minus the 4-7%. Note, not all formating software is created equal, so
the same file set will have a different UDF 2.5 image size depending on the formating soft-
ware.  Some software is much more efficient than others. If you are just over the limit with
one formating software, try another.
When adding up file sizes, use the actual file size, not the “size on disk” value, since the
space taken on the hard disk is dependent on the block size. Likewise, space taken up by each
file on a BD can be more than the actual file size. For a very tight bit budget, adjust the size
of each file by the BD sector size — divide the file size in bytes by 2048, round up, then mul-
tiply by 2048. This will give the sector-adjusted file size, which represents the true amount of
space the file occupies on the BD.
Creating a two layer disc, e.g. a BD-9 or a BD-50, is not as simple as it might seem. You
need an image file for each layer. Simply dividing your project in half and creating two disc
images will not work. A dual layer disc has a single UDF bridge directory section located on
the first layer that references files on both layers. If you simply use formatting software to
create two images, you will get two volumes, each with its own directory section. The first
layer will work fine, but the second layer will be inaccessible. Use a BD authoring/premas-

tering application or a BD-ROM formatting utility that knows how to create BD-9 or BD-50
CMF images, preferably one that lets you specify where the layer break occurs.
A/V File Formats
When creating a multimedia BD for playback on PCs, you have essentially two choices for
the A/V format — BD-ROM Video files (.m2ts), or computer-oriented media files
(.flv,.avi, .mov, .mpg, et cetera). The advantages of using BD-Video content are that
the disc will also play in standard BD players, the features of DVD-ROM Video such as
angles, seamless branching, fast chapter access, and subtitles are available, and the video will
be more compatible with PC decoders.
The advantages of using other formats are that the development tools are simple, widely
available and, often, inexpensive. Since the data rate of most BD drives is at least equivalent
to an 80x CD-ROM drive, high data rates can be used with a variety of codecs beyond those
that are included in the BD specification — Windows Media Video, Flash, 2K or 4K. Rich
Internet applications that have interactivity beyond what is possible within BD-Video may
also be much easier to create that work on both Windows, Linux and Macintosh computers
by using tools such as Adobe AIR or Microsoft's Silverlight. Older technologies, such as
Adobe/Macromedia Director, Click2Learn Toolbook, or even HTML authoring applications,
can be used to create multimedia experiences that surpass even the vast array of capabilities
included in BD Profile 2.0.
Hybrid Discs
If you are adding computer data/files to a BD-ROM Video (or adding BD-ROM Video
content to a data disc), be mindful of a few things. If you will be replicating the disc, you will
need to use a formatting or premastering software tool that allows for both data files and
BD-ROM Video files. Multiplexing and file topology on the disc are critical to ensure prop-
er playback of BD-ROM Video. Be sure to run a verifier on the final UDF 2.5 image to
ensure that the added computer data has been properly interleaved and layed out with the
BD-ROM Video files and that the appropriate padding has been reserved for the AACS
data. These discs will play fine in software players on PCs and work on all of the BD settop
players. If you add more than a few data/computer files to a BD-ROM Video disc, put them
in a subdirectory. Too many extra files in the root directory may cause some BD players to
fail. Many authoring/premastering software tools assume that the BD-ROM Video will take
up most of the space on the disc. But, if you have a lot of space consumed by the computer
files, make sure that the premastering software lets you have control over where the files will
be placed on the disc.
Disc topology or where the files go on the disc is critical especially for multilayer discs. For
database applications, you want to ensure that the indices are placed close to the data. You
do not necessarily want the indices to be on one layer and the data on another. You want to
be able to fine tune the file topology so that your BD-ROM Video content and the comput-
er application files have the best performance when played on the final replicated optical
disc.

Chapter 13
Blu-ray and Beyond
This chapter examines past and present forecasts1 and looks ahead to possibilities for Blu-
ray over the next decade or so. Questions, such as, “When will the format war end and which
format will emerge victorious?” have been answered, but many other questions remain —
“When will Blu-ray discs or players begin to outsell DVD discs or players?” “Will we ever
need another physical video format?” “What comes after blue laser?” “Will the Internet
obviate the need for physical media?” This chapter touches on these and other questions.
In the fall of 2008, as this book was being finished, Blu-ray Disc™had just turned two years
old (counting birthday candles from first disc and player shipments in June 2006). By many
measures, it is doing better than DVD did at the same stage, but there are obviously several
apples-to-orange factors at play. One major difference is that the Blu-ray format has the Sony
PlayStation 3 (PS3) to give it a major boost.
Looking Back at DVD
In 1997, the first year of DVD, 349,000 players were sold to dealers in the US. This was
more than double the first three years of VCR sales from 1975 to 1977, and represented
more than 12 times the first-year sales of CD players in 1983 (see Table 13.1). In comparison,
in 2006 — Blu-ray’s first year — only 25,000 standalone players were sold in the US, although
adding PS3 players to the mix brings the total to 425,000. Admittedly, DVD was released in
March of its first year, compared to Blu-ray’s June launch, but the DVD launch was limited
primarily to Warner Bros.’ seven-city trial until August.

Just over one million DVD players were sold in 1998, its second year. Roughly 350,000
Blu-ray players sold in 2007, its second year, although PS3 sales in the US kicked the num-
ber up to about 2.6 million. More than four million DVD players were sold in 1999 for a US
total of about 5.5 million at the end of 1999. About 2.5 million standalone Blu-ray players
sold in 2008, with 5.7 million PS3s lifting the combined sales to around 8.2 million. 
Comparing Blu-ray to DVD during the first three years of each format, Blu-ray straddled
the line with standalone player sales below DVD player sales while combined BD and PS3
players were significantly higher (see Figure 13.1).
Research results indicate over 80 percent of PS3 owners watch Blu-ray titles and the com-
bined player sales are meaningful, but comparing DVD and Blu-ray player sales head to head
does not paint a very precise picture. Disc sales, perhaps, tell a more consequential story.
In the first two years, somewhere between 16.3 and 30.6 million DVDs were sold in the
US, depending on who is counting. It seems only fair to combine Blu-ray and HD DVD sales
for the period since the two formats were competing for the same customers and were spread
fairly equally across the studios. High-definition discs of both flavors sold somewhere
between 6.1 and 11.25 million units in the US between June of 2006 and the end of 2007.
That is more or less half of DVD sales during the equivalent period.
In October 2000, the ten millionth US DVD player shipped. Three-and-a-half years after
their US introduction, DVD players achieved the mark that VCRs and CD players each took
eight years to reach. By the end of 2007, over 98 million US households (84 percent) owned
a DVD player. This compares to 112 million US households (97 percent) in 2007 that owned
a TV. The total number of DVD playback devices — including players, DVD computers, and
DVD game consoles — passed the one billion mark in 2007. DVD disc sales reached their
peak from 2004 to 2006, generating over $24 billion in US sales and rentals each year.
Worldwide DVD sales and rentals in 2006 were over $50 billion.
In June 2008, Futuresource Consulting released a report that projected combined sales of
Blu-ray players and PS3 consoles in Western Europe would reach 10.48 million units by the
end of the year. The report pointed out that only 1.58 million DVD players sold during the
similar time period (1997 to 1999). However, DVD was not officially launched in Europe
until the middle of 1998, so it was not a fair comparison. And, of course, there is the PS3
effect to consider.

Many dubious and even anecdotal reports floated around, claiming success or disaster for
Blu-ray. One wag, upon seeing 21 discs in a store, reported that the format was selling “much
better.” Even worse than the anecdotal reports were the non-sequiter reports, such as the
much bandied claim from the replication equipment maker, Singulus Technologies, that Blu-
ray adoption “far exceeded” adoption of DVD. This statement was based on orders for 21
Blu-ray dual-layer machines in the first quarter of 2008 compared to 17 DVD machines in
the same period 11 years before. Apparently a four-unit increase in a statistically invalid sam-
ple size of different products compared to a dubiously correlated time period under consid-
erably different conditions was taken seriously as an indicator of success. Large numbers of
critical thinkers were seen hurling themselves in despair from their ivory towers upon read-
ing the 350 exuberant reports of this assertion that appeared on the Internet.
Nevertheless, Blu-ray was doing fine. It was expected that by the end of 2008 there would
be approximately 30 million Blu-ray playback devices worldwide, about two thirds of them
PS3s. Over 15 million Blu-ray discs had been shipped by September 2008, with about 1000
different titles available (see Figures 13.2 and 13.3).

According to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), 40 million US households (36
percent) were on track to have HDTV sets by the end of 2008, for a total installed based of
52.5 million sets. Less than half of the sets were set up to receive HDTV programming.
HDTV penetration at the end of 2008 was around 35 percent in the UK, 30 percent in Japan,
18 percent in Germany, and 21 percent in France.
Peering Forward...Into the Digital Fog
The variables in predicting the path of Blu-ray are extremely complex, but this has not
deterred many people from conjectures ranging from sensible to outrageous. Looking back
on how DVD forecasts fared in the face of actual events, it seems that some prognosticators
do a reasonable job with ballpark numbers while others should consider becoming weather
forecasters. At least they would increase their accuracy to 50 percent.
In 2008, every analyst’s favorite setting on the prognostication machine was 2012, four
years out. Adams Media Research predicted that by 2012 there would be 100 million Blu-ray
players, including 30 million PS3s, worldwide. The Entertainment Merchant Association pre-
dicted 115 million. Strategy Analytics predicted 132 million — representing 55 percent
household penetration in Japan, 32 percent in Europe, and 44 percent in the US. These were
all impressive numbers yet, at the same time, reports appeared about how Blu-ray sales were
“stumbling” and Blu-ray would soon be eclipsed by digital delivery and video on demand.
Despite the nattering of naysayers, Blu-ray is guaranteed to succeed. It will be around for
decades, especially given its heritage from CD and DVD. Consider the thinking that pre-
vailed in the 1980’s and 1990’s about technology lifecycles. At the time, almost every new
generation of reproduction technology had to displace preceding technologies, requiring a
complete changeover of devices and media. This was especially true of analog technologies,
but it also applied to digital. Witness portable data storage transitions from 8-inch floppy
disks to 5-inch floppies to 3.5-inch diskettes and then to USB drives. Or, video formats from
70 mm film to 35 mm to 16 mm to 8 mm to super 8, along with U-matic tape, VHS, laserdisc,
VHS-C, 8 mm videotape, Hi8, Digital 8, Mini DV, and so on, not to mention the litany of pro-
fessional tape formats. Or, portable music format transitions from 33-, 45-, and 78-rpm vinyl
records and reel-to-reel tape to cassette tape, 8-track tape, CD, DAT, DCC, MiniDisc, and
eventually MP3 files on portable players. Since conversion between formats was difficult, and
formats tended to last ten to twenty years, it was not surprising that CD was expected to peter
out after twenty years. But on its 25th birthday, in 2008, CD was far from obsolete. The over-
looked difference was that succeeding formats were backwards compatible with CDs. DVD
players and DVD-ROM drives, as well as, BD players and BD-ROM drives, all read CDs.
The effect carries forward as well. The ability of BD players and drives to read tens of bil-
lions of CDs and DVDs makes them significantly more compelling and valuable than so-
called disruptive — but incompatible — technologies.
The question is not whether Blu-ray will succeed, it is how successful will Blu-ray be? In
other words, how compelling is the format that comes after DVD? DVD is a tough act to fol-
low because it was such a vast improvement over VHS tape. DVD heralded the switch from
analog to digital video, added multichannel audio, quick access to programs with chapters,
menus and interactivity, multiple audio tracks and subtitles, and much more. Blu-ray offers
Blu-ray and Beyond

essentially the same thing. Blu-ray picture quality is better, but DVDs already look pretty
good on HDTV sets. Interactivity is significantly improved, but consumers are not exactly
rioting in the streets demanding more interactive titles. The promise of fresh new content
delivered to Internet-connected players is probably the most interesting new feature. Is it
enough to get consumers to make the switch to new players and, more importantly, start
changing their collections over to HD format? It depends, in part, on the draw of HDTV.
Anyone who has paid a lot of money for a high-definition display will want high quality, high-
definition content to feel like they are getting their money’s worth.
Some people expect that Blu-ray will be adopted even faster than DVD, which is actually
the case if PS3s are counted. However, the format war clearly delayed adoption and allowed
consumers to gravitate toward alternative sources, such as, pay-per-view, video on demand,
and the Internet. The outlook is brighter on the computer side, where demand for increased
storage never abates. Major computer manufacturers such as Apple, Dell, and HP support
the Blu-ray format. Notebook computers, now selling more than desktop models, are getting
smaller and less likely to have an internal disc drive, but it is still inevitable that prices of BD
drives will drop to the point that they replace DVD drives, which largely replaced CD drives
after 2005.
Beyond Blu-ray
Blu-ray Disc is almost certainly the last mainstream packaged media format. There were
good reasons to raise the bar above DVD, the most important one being high-definition
video. Few consumers need anything beyond 1080p high-definition. Digital cinema resolu-
tions, such as, 2k (2048×1152) and 4k (4096×2304), are unlikely to make their way into
average homes. Stereovision (3D TV) is gaining momentum, but can be accommodated eas-
ily in Blu-ray with minor format updates. In August 2008, Taka Miyama, Sony’s product strat-
egy manager for home video marketing in Europe, said, “Blu-ray is the final format for the
optical disc. We don’t have a shorter laser.”
The most promising successor technology to blue-laser optical media is holographic stor-
age, which came on the market in 2007 with commercial products.2 Holographic systems read
and write millions of bits simultaneously in a few milliseconds by arranging them in “pages”
stored on 12 cm (5-inch) discs in holographic interference patterns. At introduction, holo-
graphic disc capacity was 300 Gbytes, but plans were in place for capacities up to 1.6 trillion
bytes (about 32 times the capacity of a dual-layer BD), with data transfer rates over one giga-
bit per second (more than twice as fast as a 12x BD drive). However, there simply is not a
demand for that kind of capacity and data rate in a consumer pre-recorded media format.
Computer applications can always use more storage capacity, but without an entertainment
format to drive adoption, future computer storage solutions will fragment, as in the days of
Syquest, Bernoulli, Zip, Jaz, and MO drives. Holographic storage may flourish, but only in
niche markets.
The primary competitor to holographic storage is actually an enhanced version of Blu-ray.
Blu-ray and Beyond

2This refers to using holographic laser technology to store data, not to three-dimensional holographic video.

In 2005, before blue-laser formats reached the marketplace, variations such as four layers
were being demonstrated. In July 2008, Pioneer presented research results for a 20-layer Blu-
ray disc holding 500 Gbytes, plenty to store hours of 4k video. Existing Blu-ray readers prob-
ably cannot be software-upgraded to read multilayer BDs, but new Blu-ray products could be
easily modified to handle multiple layers. Such increased capacity for Blu-ray Discs is espe-
cially appealing for smaller 8 cm (3-inch) discs for use in camcorders and the like.
Other future possibilities include superlenses (which focus light to a spot much smaller
than its own wavelength, getting past the “we don’t have a shorter laser” problem), diamond-
based x-ray lasers, charged particle beam recorders, near-field scanning microscopy, atomic
force microscope arrays (millipede), memristors, electron spin manipulation (spintronics),
nanodots, nanomechanics, carbon nanotube grids, self-assembling polymer arrays, and any
number of new technologies for manipulating matter in ways to store vast amounts of data.
But, it is likely that any such products will find only niche applications for portable media.
Blu-ray will remain the mainstream portable media format until it is eventually displaced by
wireless connections and solid-state memory cards, once they become cheap enough.
The Death of DVD?
Just as CD has lived much longer than most people expected, DVD will enjoy a long life
in the nurturing shadow of Blu-ray. The total number of DVD devices will eventually pass
two billion, which makes for an accumulation that will not dwindle quickly. DVD drives will
disappear first, followed by players, but the vast collections of video and data on DVDs, still
usable in BD players and drives, will endure long after manufacturers abandon the devices.
Seeing Double
Probably the most significant new development that will affect Blu-ray is stereovision, or
3D video. Beginning in 2005, Hollywood studios discovered that revenue from theaters show-
ing 3D films was two to four times higher than from standard films, partly because the tick-
et prices were higher and partly because the 3D versions attracted more viewers. (Or maybe
it’s just that wearing 3D glasses makes you eat more popcorn.) Many studios, especially
Disney, Dreamworks, and Paramount, began seriously studying 3D technologies for both
theater and home use.
There are, essentially, six technologies that may be used for 3D viewing —
j Anaglyph, using the good old red/green or red/cyan glasses;
j Color shift, an improvement on anaglyph that filters bands of color into each eye
(Dolby 3D);
j Polarization, usually circular, with polarized glasses (Real D and MasterImage);
j Shutter, using active LCD shutters on glasses synchronized to the display to
alternately feed the image to each eye (XpandD);
j Head-mounted displays, using helmets or glasses with two built-in screens, one
for each eye (Sony, Sensics, Nintendo, and many others); and
j Autostereoscopic, using image separators, such as, lenticular filters or parallax

barriers in front of the display to produce two slightly different images (Philips,
Dimension, SeeReal, Sharp, and others).
Digital cameras, digital processing, and digital projection made the renaissance of 3D
movies possible. It is expected that 3D theater screens will grow to 7,000 in the US by the end
of 2010, and to about 2500 in the rest of the world.
For theatrical projection, each frame image is flashed six times — instead of the usual two
times — to produce a refresh rate of 144 frames per second. For home use, 60- or 120-Hz
frame-sequential (left eye/right eye) progressive-scan video at 1080p gives very good results,
without the flicker and eyestrain often associated with 3D video. Given the importance of
high-definition for good 3D picture quality and the potential need for higher frame rates,
Blu-ray is the perfect candidate to carry 3D movies into the living room.
At the CEATEC show in Japan in October, 2008, Panasonic demonstrated a prototype sys-
tem using a modified Blu-ray player, a 120 Hz 100-inch plasma screen, and polarized glass-
es. Groups, such as, SMPTE’s 3D Home Display Task Force and the 3D@Home Consortium
are working to facilitate standardization, which could find its way to Blu-ray. The simple
approach for Blu-ray is to pass 3D video (using anaglyph or split-resolution approaches) out
the HDMI connector to devices that know how to handle it. This has the advantage of poten-
tially working in every Blu-ray player on the market, but the disadvantages of not supporting
active 3D technologies, not using higher frame rates, and not integrating onscreen menus
and interactivity into the experience by controlling the depth of the Blu-ray graphics planes.
It may be that a new generation of BD players (Profile 5?) is the best way to add 3D.
The Changing Face of Home Entertainment 
The final few years of the 20th century were a watershed period for digital formats. Direct
broadcast digital satellite (DBS) systems, such as, DirecTV/USSB and DISH Network, were
introduced in the US beginning in 1994. DirectTV signed up more than three million cus-
tomers in three years, making DBS the most successful consumer electronics format to date.
The first DVB-S (satellite) broadcasts began in Europe in 1995 and in Japan in 1996, fol-
lowed by DVB-T (terrestrial) broadcasts in Europe in 1998. DVD was unveiled in Japan in
1996, launched in the US in 1997, and officially launched in Europe in 1998. It went on to
surpass DBS and become one of the most successful consumer electronics formats of all
time. The first HDTV sets went on sale in the United States in 1998.
DBS and DVD each had one foot in the past and one foot in the future. They used digi-
tal signal recording and compression methods to squeeze the most quality into their limited
transmission and storage capacities, then converted the signal to analog format for display on
conventional televisions. As digital televisions slowly pushed their creaky predecessors out of
living rooms and offices, DVD players sprouted digital video outputs to complete the shift
from analog to digital. Blu-ray then took the baton to advance the movement to high-defin-
ition, progressive-scan, digital video, leaving behind the flicker and flutter of interlaced video
and enabling television personalities everywhere to wear pinstriped fabrics and sit in front of
miniblinds.
Consumer electronics devices of the 21st century, such as, televisions, DVD players, Blu-
ray players, and mobile phones, now contain computer processors more powerful than super-

computers of the 1980s. As consumer electronics companies and computer makers endeav-
or to make their products more suitable to the basic entertainment, communication, and pro-
ductivity needs of home users, features from computers, such as, onscreen menus, touch
screens, multiple windows, and even Internet connections, have become commonplace.
DVD and Blu-ray are perfect formats for this environment because they are able to carry
content for the television, the computer, and all the variations between.
Even movie theaters are being changed by digital technology. The success of digital cine-
ma has shown that film can, and should, be replaced by digital files. Movies are being
released simultaneously worldwide, or very shortly after US release dates, as the old model
of movie distribution has been changed by digital distribution and by Internet advertising
that hits all audiences simultaneously.
Convergence is happening with systems other than desktop computers and TV. The prime
candidates are cable settop boxes, satellite receivers, video game consoles, telephones,
mobile phones, laptop computers, portable music and video players, PVRs, DVD players,
and, of course, Blu-ray players (see Figure 13.4 at the end of this chapter).
In short, because of the flexibility and interconnectability of inexpensive digital electron-
ics, all the independent pieces we were once accustomed to have been tossed in a big hat,
shaken around, and pulled back out as new, mixed-and-matched systems with more features
at lower prices. Customers are benefiting from personalization, independence from location,
and independence from time. Our electronic devices are getting closer to the goal of enabling
us to access anything, anytime, in any format we choose.
The Far Horizon 
In 2004, two very rich men predicted the imminent death of optical disc technology. In
July, 2004, speaking to Germany’s Bild magazine, Bill Gates said, “The entertainment of the
future will definitely not be on a DVD player, that technology will be completely gone with-
in 10 years at the most.” In an August, 2004, Internet blog, HDNet’s Mark Cuban said,
“Which is the better way to deliver a movie or movies? On a DVD with a boring, lifeless
future, or hard drives?” Apparently the amount of money in one’s bank account can be
inversely proportional to one’s connection with the real world, because they are both wrong.3
Bill Gates is not wrong about the eventual disappearance of packaged media, but he is wrong
about the timeframe. His deadline comes only two years after 2012, the year many people
expect Blu-ray disc sales to finally catch up with DVD sales.
In September 2008, Andy Griffiths, director of consumer electronics at Samsung UK, ruf-
fled a lot of blue feathers when he told the Pocket-lint Website, “I think [Blu-ray] has five
years left, I certainly wouldn’t give it ten.” He was neither the first nor the last person to pre-
dict an early demise for Blu-ray, DVD, and CD before it.
Blu-ray and Beyond
1 3 - 8

Blu-ray Disc Demystified
3Cuban seems to ignore the fact that millions of copies of DVDs or Blu-ray discs can be mass produced for
less than a dollar or two, and even the cheapest hard disks cost hundreds of times more. Even putting hun-
dreds of movies on a single hard drive would never make it economical to ship the drives to thousands or mil-
lions of customers. As pointed out in Chapter 11, the cost of Internet delivery and Blu-ray delivery are not far
apart, at all. Lastly, compare the interesting interactive features of Blu-ray with a typical Internet video down-
load where you are lucky if you can even reliably fast forward. Which is the boring one?

If you look back at predictions of the death of CD from Internet-delivered music, it is easy
to see how people get carried away by the promise of new technology and new paradigms,
seriously underestimating the inertia of established technologies. Consider that MP3 files
became popular around 1996, developed into the Internet’s “killer app” in 1999 with the
release of Napster, were legitimized and commercialized in 2001 by Apple’s iTunes, yet when
Blu-ray was released a decade after MP3 came to life, CDs and DVDs still accounted for
more than 77 percent of US music sales compared to downloaded songs and mobile-phone
ringtones.4 At the beginning of 2008, Forrester Research projected that US digital music
download sales would finally surpass CD sales in 2012. And that is music downloads, which
had a roughly ten-year head start on video downloads, which do not lend themselves as well
to downloading and playing on portable devices. Speaking of portable devices, consider the
number of DVD and Blu-ray entertainment systems in vehicles, which will take much longer
to become Internet connected. Add in the fact that most people don’t throw away their old
DVD or Blu-ray player when they buy a new one — instead they put the old one in another
room or give it to the kids. Anyone who thinks that online delivery will soon displace the
incredible inertia represented by over a billion DVD playback devices, hundreds of millions
of Blu-ray playback devices, and tens of billions of discs is not even dipping a toe into the
waters of reality.
Eventually the demand for physical media will decline, but it will require an arduous
increase in bandwidth from the completely insufficient typical rate of 2 to 5 Mbps (see Table
B.6), plus a new generation of consumers who are comfortable with ephemeral delivery of
content rather than ownership of tangible property. This might happen as soon as 2020, but
certainly not before 2010 or even 2015, as some people predict.
The Internet has begun to merge with cable TV, broadcast TV, radio, telephones, satellites,
and, even, newspapers and magazines. The Internet will eventually take over the communi-
cations world. News, movies, music, advertising, education, games, financial transactions, e-
mail, and most other forms of information will be delivered via a world-spanning network.
Internet bandwidth, currently lagging far behind the load being demanded of it, will eventu-
ally catch up, as did other systems, such as, intercontinental telephone networks and com-
munication satellites. Discrete media, such as, Blu-ray will then be relegated to niches, such
as, data backups, photo archiving, and collector’s editions of movies with fancy packaging.
Why go to a store to buy software on a disc or to a movie rental store to rent a DVD or BD
when you can have it delivered right to your computer or your TV or your digital video
recorder? In the intervening years, however, optical media in all its permutations and gener-
ations — including Blu-ray — promises to be the definitive medium for both computers and
home entertainment.

4CDs represented 72 percent of sales, while music DVDs accounted for about 4.5 percent and DVD-Audio
and SACD discs each contributed a barely noticeable 0.03 percent. The US leads the world in digital music
sales, so the numbers for non-physical sales in other countries are even smaller. Over 30 percent of digital
music revenues in 2007 in US — and an astounding 91 percent in Japan — came from the mobile market,
which clearly won’t have the same effect with movie downloads. US figures are from the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA). Japan figures are from IFPI.

Appendix A
About the Disc
The Blu-ray Disc™provided with this book includes material that demonstrates many of
the features available with the Blu-ray Disc format. As described in Chapter 7, Players, the
Profile level of a player determines the feature playability of a Blu-ray Disc player. Please
read the Profile sections below to understand how some features might work on a Blu-ray
player. Figure A.1, Disc Flowchart, presented at the end of this appendix, depicts the con-
tents of the accompanying disc.
Most Blu-ray player users will already be familiar with some of the format features, such
as, pop-up menus and button sounds. To demonstrate the picture in picture (PIP) feature,
this disc includes Bonus View material that can be displayed when the VC1 1920×1080 video
element is playing. And, this disc includes BD-Live (Profile 2.0) elements which allow a user
to download material via the Internet, located at http://www.bddemystified.com.
The main menu is displayed following the playing of the First Play Logos. The main menu
is also available as a popup menu using the popup key on the player remote control. The
menu is divided into four primary tiers, or branches, that connect to the disc content —

Features
Blu-ray technology accommodates video that may be encoded using any one of three
encoding varieties — MPEG2, H.264 AVC, or VC1. The accompanying disc presents the
same video element that has been encoded in each of the three encoding flavors, at a
1920×1080 video resolution. 
PIP video is provided on the disc that has been created to only play with the VC1 feature
video. Although acquired in a high definition format, the resolution of this picture in picture
video has been decreased to demonstrate video as a 1280×720 aspect ratio and as a
720×480 aspect ratio, when using the VC1 video feature.
All of the feature video pieces include the audio and subtitle streams that are outlined in
the Setup section below. Information about each video piece may appear as a programmat-
ic on-screen display while the video plays.

Setup
Two streams of audio are provided for each version of the feature video — 5.1 uncom-
pressed PCM and DTS 5.1.
Three subtitle streams have been provided for each version of the feature video —
English, French and Chinese.
Bonus
The bonus section of the disc offers three bonus components — downloadable material,
the Bunny Blaster game, and a bonus piece that presents audio streams in either 5.1 or 7.1
DTS HD.
Downloadable Material
Three high definition web video pieces are available for download, when an Internet con-
nection exists for a Blu-ray Disc player. These elements are accessible via an Internet con-
nection that is designed by RCDb (Related Content Database). The videos are each ten sec-
ond in length, and demonstrate the ability to gain access to new video content that can
accompany the content already present on a disc.
Roxio BD Live is a BD-J application that showcases the interactivity and extensibility of
the Blu-ray platform. Roxio BD Live can download an updated BD-J application from a
Roxio website, demonstrating that applications that can take advantage of the rich interac-
tivity of the BD format platform.
Bunny Blaster Game
The Bunny Blaster game demonstrates the use of BD-J as a programming language to
enable collision detection. Games like this were never possible on DVD!
Bonus Audio Format Selection
A bonus video element provides demonstration audio streams in either 5.1 DTS HD or
the new 7.1 DTS HD surround.

ton combination is executed incorrectly, a message will reveal that you did not execute the
combination correctly. You may try again.
Player Profiles Functionality
This disc demonstrates functionality for the three Blu-ray Disc player profiles. The func-
tionality for Profile 1.1 will not appear on a Profile 1.0 player.  The functionality programmed
in Profile 2.0 will not function in either a Profile 1.1 or a Profile 1.0 player.
Profile 1.0 Functionality
All players exhibit the Profile 1.0 functions. This disc contains BD-Java popup menus, but-
ton sounds, 1920×1080 video in VC1, AVC, and MPEG2 video formats, LPCM 5.1 audio,
DTS HD Master Audio, DTS HD 7.1 audio, and font rendered text. The Bunny Blaster game
will also function in all players.
Profile 1.1 Functionality
Players with Profile 1.1 will exhibit the picture in picture (PIP) video as an example of
Profile 1.1 functionality. On the main menu, or on the popup menu, a leaf will appear on the
1920×1080 VC1 video button that can be used to enable or disable the PIP video streams
for the video feature. The PIP is only available with the 1920×1080 VC1 video stream and
these buttons only appear with VC1 button. If the player is Profile level 1.0, the graphic leaf
will not display.
Profile 2.0 Functionality
Only players with Profile 2.0 allow access to the Internet via an ethernet cable. This disc
demonstrates this function allowing the user to download a choice of three video pieces from
the website, http://www.bddemystified.com/. All three video pieces are ten seconds in length
but vary in their compression bitrate. Download speed will vary depending on the through-
put of the Internet connection. A player that is not Profile 2.0 enabled will not allow down-
load and will display the message, “Your player is not Profile 2.0 network compatible”.
The high bitrate version of the video is the best video quality at approximately 27Mbps but
is the largest in size at approximately 38MB. This high bitrate video will look the best but will
take the longest to download.
The medium video is encoded at a bitrate of approximately 10Mbps and its size is approx-
imately 9MB.
The low bitrate video is encoded at approximately 6Mbps and is the smallest in size at
approximately 6MB.
Each of these files may be downloaded onto a player that has an extended storage capa-
bility referred to as BUDA (Binding Unit Data Area). The files will remain in BUDA or they
can be deleted using the trashcan icon that may be displayed on-screen. Some players may
have an onboard system to delete BUDA material manually, as well.

Table B.8  Video Resolution (continued)
Notes:
1. BD is neither PAL nor NTSC. The values are placed in the NTSC rows for convenience.
2. Wide aspect ratios (1.78 and 2.35) for VHS, LD, and VCD assume a letterboxed picture. For comparison, letterboxed 1.66 aspect ratio resolution
is about 7 percent higher than 1.78. Letterbox is also assumed for DVD and BD at a 2.35 aspect ratio. DVD’s native aspect ratio is 1.33; it uses
anamorphic mode for 1.78. BD’s native aspect ratio is 1.78.
3. The very rare 1.78 anamorphic LD has the same pixel count as 1.33 LD. Anamorphic LD letterboxed to 2.35 has almost the same pixel count as
1.78 LD (567×363). The almost non-existent 1.78 anamorphic VHS has the same pixel count as 1.33 VHS. Anamorphic VHS letterboxed to 2.35
has almost the same pixel count as 1.78 VHS (333×363). No commercial 2.35 anamorphic format exists and no corresponding stretch mode
exists on widescreen TVs.
4. TVL is lines of horizontal resolution per picture height. For analog formats, the customary value is used; for digital formats, the value is derived
from the actual horizontal pixel count adjusted for the aspect ratio. DVD’s horizontal resolution is lower for 1.78 because the pixels are wider.
Pixels for VHS and LD are approximations based on TVL and scan lines.
5. Resolutions refer to the medium, not the display. If a BD or DVD player performs automatic letterboxing on a 1.85 movie (stored in 1.78), the dis-
played vertical resolution on a standard 1.33 TV is the same as from a letterboxed LD (360 lines).

* Language code is not supported by the player text subtitle capability bitmap stored in PSRs 48-61. Sadly,
Klingon is one of these.
Note 1: The Blu-ray specifications refer to ISO 639-2:1988, which has been updated regularly since 1998.
Because players have been in production since 2006, it is recommended that codes as of 2006 (as shown in
this table) be used in disc production to be compatible with older players. It is recommended that players rec-
ognize old codes and map them to any corresponding new codes.
Note 2: Blu-ray uses ISO 639-2/T, which lists roughly 480 three-letter codes for languages and language
groups, many of them obscure or no longer used. The “T” refers to the codes for terminology purposes, which
sometimes differ from the “B” codes for bibliographic purposes. ISO 639-1 lists 185 two-letter codes for more
general terminology purposes. These are included for reference.
Note 3: DVD uses ISO 639-1 codes, represented as pairs of two-digit decimal or hexadecimal numbers repre-
senting each letter. These are not formally used in Blu-ray formats but may be used by Blu-ray players to set
the preferred language for both BD and DVD discs.

Appendix C
Related Standards and
Specifications
The Blu-ray Disc™format is based on or has borrowed from dozens of standards devel-
oped over the years by many organizations. Most of the standards in this appendix are a nor-
mative part of the format. Some, such as CD and Video CD, are for players that choose to
implement the format. Many standards and specifications have been updated since most of
the Blu-ray format was finalized in 2005. The best practice is for players to implement the
latest version (as long as it does not change things in a way that would cause compatibility
problems) and for discs to implement the older version specified here. Blu-ray format
updates after 2008 may refer to newer versions of the standards and specifications listed
here.

Glossary
1080i
1080 lines of interlaced video (540 lines per field). Usually refers to 1920×1080 resolution in
1.78 aspect ratio. 1080i30 refers to 30 interlaced frames (60 fields) per second, which is often confus-
ingly written as 1080i60.
1080p
1080 lines of progressive video (1080 lines per frame). Usually refers to 1920×1080 resolution
in 1.78 aspect ratio. 1080p30 refers to 30 frames per second. 1080p24 refers to 24 frames per second
(film source).
17PP
1-7 parity preserve, the RLL(1,7) modulation technique used by BD, where each set of 2 bits is
replaced by a 3-bit code before being written onto the disc.
2-2 pulldown
The process of transferring 24-frame-per-second film to video by repeating each film
frame as two video fields. When 24-fps film is converted via 2-2 pulldown to 25-fps 625/50 (PAL) video,
the film runs 4 percent faster than normal.
2-3 pulldown
The process of converting 24-frame-per-second film to video by repeating one film
frame as two fields, then the next film frame as three fields.
3-2 pulldown
An uncommon variation of 2-3 pulldown, where the first film frame is repeated for three
fields instead of two. Most people mean 2-3 pulldown when they say 3-2 pulldown.
4:1:1
The component digital video format with one Cb sample and one Cr sample for every four Y
samples. 4:1 horizontal downsampling with no vertical downsampling. Chroma is sampled on every line,
but only for every four luma pixels (i.e., 1 pixel in a 1×4 grid). This amounts to a subsampling of chro-
ma by a factor of two compared to luma (and by a factor of four for a single Cb or Cr component). BD
and DVD use 4:2:0 sampling, not 4:1:1 sampling.
4:2:0
The component digital video format used by BD and DVD, where there is one Cb sample and
one Cr sample for every four Y samples (i.e., 1 pixel in a 2×2 grid). 2:1 horizontal downsampling and
2:1 vertical downsampling. Cb and Cr are sampled on every other line, in between the scan lines, with
one set of chroma samples for each two luma samples on a line. This amounts to a subsampling of chro-
ma by a factor of two compared to luma (and by a factor of four for a single Cb or Cr component).
4:2:2
The component digital video format commonly used for studio recordings, where there is one
Cb sample and one Cr sample for every two Y samples (i.e., 1 pixel in a 1×2 grid). 2:1 horizontal down-
sampling with no vertical downsampling. This allocates the same number of samples to the chroma sig-
nal as to the luma signal. The input to MPEG-2 encoders is typically in 4:2:2 format, but the video is
subsampled to 4:2:0 before being encoded and stored.
4:4:4
A component digital video format for high-end studio recordings, where Y, Cb, and Cr are sam-
pled equally.
480i
480 lines of interlaced video (240 lines per field). Usually refers to 720×480 (or 704×480) reso-
lution.
480p
480 lines of progressive video (480 lines per frame). Usually refers to 720×480 (or 704×480)
resolution. 480p60 refers to 60 frames per second; 480p30 refers to 30 frames per second; and 480p24
refers to 24 frames per second (film source). 
4C
The four-company entity that produces copy-protection schemes: IBM, Intel, Panasonic, Toshiba.
See CPRM, CPPM, and www.4centity.com.

quate levels for recording. Also see Macrovision. 
aliasing
A distortion (artifact) in the reproduction of digital audio or video that results when the sig-
nal frequency is more than half the sampling frequency. The sampling resolution is insufficient to dis-
tinguish between alternate reconstructions of the waveform (high-frequency components of the signal
resemble low-frequency components), thus admitting noise that was not present in the original signal.

artifact
An unnatural effect not present in the original video or audio, produced by an external agent
or action. Artifacts can be caused by many factors, including digital compression, film-to-video trans-
fer, transmission errors, data readout errors, electrical interference, analog signal noise, and analog sig-
nal crosstalk. Most artifacts attributed to the digital compression of DVD are in fact from other
sources. Digital compression artifacts will always occur in the same place and in the same way. Possible
MPEG artifacts are mosquitoes, blocking, and video noise. 
aspect ratio
The width-to-height ratio of an image. A 4:3 aspect ratio means the horizontal size is a
third again wider than the vertical size. Standard television ratio is 4:3 (or 1.33:1). Widescreen DVD
and HTDV aspect ratio is 16:9 (or 1.78:1). Common film aspect ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.35:1. Aspect
ratios normalized to a height of 1 are often abbreviated by leaving off the :1.

(FCC) empaneled the Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service (ACATS) as an investiga-
tory and advisory committee to develop information that would assist the FCC in establishing an
advanced broadcast television (ATV) standard for the United States. This committee created a sub-
committee, the ATSC, to explore the need for and to coordinate development of the documentation of
Advanced Television Systems. In 1993, the ATSC recommended that efforts be limited to a digital tele-
vision system (DTV), and in September 1995 issued its recommendation for a Digital Television System
standard, which was approved with the exclusion of compression format constraints (picture resolution,
frame rate, and frame sequence). 
ATV
Advanced television. TV with significantly better video and audio than standard TV. Sometimes
used interchangeably with HDTV, but more accurately encompasses any improved television system,
including those beyond HDTV. Also sometimes used interchangeably with the final recommended
standard of the ATSC, which is more correctly called DTV. 
audio coding mode    The method by which audio is digitally encoded, such as PCM, AC3, DTS, MPEG
Audio or SDDS.

color banding
An artifact related to digital graphics with insufficient color depth to represent subtle
differences in color. Banding occurs most visibly in slow gradients such as the fade of the blue sky. It
appears as hard lines (bands) as the shade of the color changes.
color depth
The number of levels of color (usually including luma and chroma) that can be repre-
sented by a pixel. Generally expressed as a number of bits or a number of colors. The color depth of
MPEG video in DVD is 24 bits, although the chroma component is shared across 4 pixels (averaging
12 actual bits per pixel). 
color difference
A pair of video signals that contain the color components minus the brightness com-
ponent, usually B-Y and R-Y (G-Y is not used, since it generally carries less information). The color-
difference signals for a black-and-white picture are zero. The advantage of color-difference signals is
that the color component can be reduced more than the brightness (luma) component without being
visually perceptible. 
color model

The process of removing redundancies in digital data to reduce the amount that must
be stored or transmitted. Lossless compression removes only enough redundancy so that the original
data can be recreated exactly as it was. Lossy compression sacrifices additional data to achieve greater
compression. 
compression rate
A measurement as a percent of how much something has been compressed. For
pictures, for example, the higher the percentage is, the better the quality of the image and the bigger
the file size.

data rate 
The volume of data measured over time; the rate at which digital information can be con-
veyed. Usually expressed as bits per second with notations of kbps (thousand/sec), Mbps (million/sec),
and Gbps (billion/sec). Digital audio date rate is generally computed as the number of samples per sec-
ond times the bit size of the sample. For example, the data rate of uncompressed 16-bit, 48-kHz, two-
channel audio is 1536 kbps. Digital video bit rate is generally computed as the number of bits per pixel
times the number of pixels per line times the number of lines per frame times the number of frames
per second. For example, the data rate of a DVD movie before compression is usually
12×720×480×24 = 99.5 Mbps. Compression reduces the data rate. Digital data rate is sometimes inac-
curately equated with bandwidth.

Easter egg
A hidden feature on a disc, such as a bonus video clip, that requires the user to
take certain actions (e.g., choosing an invisible buttons, moving through buttons or menus in
a certain sequence, or even finish playing a game) before it can be accessed.
EBU
European Broadcasting Union. 
ECC
See Error correction code. 
ECC constraint length 
The number of sectors that are interleaved to combat bursty error character-
istics of discs. 16 sectors are interleaved in DVD. Interleaving combats typical disc defects such as
scratch marks by spreading the error over a larger data area, thereby increasing the chance that the
error correction codes can conceal the error.
ECD
Error detection and correction code. See error-correction code.
ECMA
European Computer Manufacturers Association (see http://www.ecma.org). 
ECMA-262
An ECMA standard that specifies the core JavaScript language (roughly equivalent to
JavaScript 1.1). Equivalent to ISO/IEC 16262.
ECMAScript
The standardized version of the JavaScript language. Used as the scripting language of
HD-DVD.
edge enhancement
When films are transferred to video in preparation for DVD encoding, they are
commonly run through digital processes that attempt to clean up the picture. These processes include
noise reduction (DVNR) and image enhancement. Enhancement increases contrast (similar to the
effect of the “sharpen” or “unsharp mask” filters in Photoshop), but can tend to overdo areas of tran-
sition between light and dark or different colors, causing a “chiseled” look or a ringing effect like the
haloes you see around street lights when driving in the rain. Video noise reduction is a good thing, when
done well, since it can remove scratches, spots, and other defects from the original film. Enhancement,
which is rarely done well, is a bad thing. The video may look sharper and clearer to the casual observ-
er, but fine tonal details of the original picture are altered and lost. 
EDS
Enhanced data services. Additional information in NTSC line such as a time signal. 
EDTV
Enhanced-definition television. A system that uses existing transmission equipment to send an
enhanced signal that looks the same on existing receivers but carries additional information to improve
the picture quality on new enhanced receivers. PALPlus is an example of EDTV. (Contrast with HDTV
and IDTV.)
EFM
Eight-to-fourteen modulation. This low-level and very critical channel coding technique maxi-
mizes pit sizes on the disc by reducing frequent transitions from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. CD employs pulse width
modulation, representing 1’s as Land-pit transitions along the track. The 8/14 code maps 8 user data
bits into 14 channel bits. In the 1982 compact disc standard (IEC 908 standard), 3 merge bits are added
to the 14 bit block to further eliminate 1-0 or 0-1 transitions between adjacent 8/14 blocks. 
EFM Plus 
DVD’s eight-to-sixteen modulation is sometimes called EFM+, since it is a derivative of
EFM. It folds the merge bits into the main 8/16 table.
EIA
Electronics Industry Association. 
EICTA
EICTA was formed in 1999 as the European Information and Communications Technology
Industry Association by the consolidation of the two former European federations of the information
and telecommunications industries. In 2001, it merged with EACEM (European Association of
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers) and changed its name to European Information,
Communications and Consumer Electronics Technology Industry Association.
E-IDE    Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics. Extensions to the IDE standard providing faster data
transfer and allowing access to larger drives, including CD-ROM and tape drives, using ATAPI. E-IDE
was adopted as a standard by ANSI in 1994. ANSI calls it Advanced Technology Attachment-2 (ATA-

ducing a disc that can be played in a music player or read by a computer. Also called CD Extra, CD
Plus, hybrid CD, interactive music CD, mixed-mode CD, pre-gap CD, or track-zero CD.
entropy coding

device. DVD and BD use versions of the UDF file system.
filter
(verb) To reduce the amount of information in a signal. (noun) A circuit or process that reduces
the amount of information in a signal. Analog filtering usually removes certain frequencies. Digital fil-
tering (when not emulating analog filtering) usually averages together multiple adjacent pixels, lines,

GOP
Group of pictures. A sequence of frames in an MPEG video stream, usually 15 frames for NTSC
DVDs or 12 frames for PAL DVDs, beginning with one or more I pictures followed by I, P, and B pic-
tures. A GOP is the atomic unit of MPEG video access. There are two types of GOPs, closed and open.
A closed GOP keeps all references (from I and P frames) within the GOP. This simplifies jumping into
the middle of a video stream, since the decoder doesn’t have to reference a frames from the previous
GOP. In an open GOP, I or P frames near the beginning or the end of a GOP may refer to frames in
the adjacent GOP. Open-GOP encoding can be slightly more efficient than closed-GOP encoding.

as a CD in DVD player or a DVD in a BD player.
letterbox
The process or form of video where black horizontal mattes are added to the top and bot-
tom of the display area in order to create a frame in which to display video using an aspect ratio dif-
ferent than that of the display. The letterbox method preserves the entire video picture, as opposed to
pan & scan. DVD-Video players can automatically letterbox an anamorphic widescreen picture for dis-
play on a standard 4:3 TV.
letterbox filter 
Circuitry in a DVD player that reduces the vertical size of anamorphic widescreen
video (combining every 4 lines into 3) and adds black mattes at the top and bottom. Also see filter.

line doubler
A video processor that doubles the number of lines in the scanning system in order to
create a display with scan lines that are less visible. Some line doublers convert from interlaced to pro-
gressive scan. 
linear PCM
A coded representation of digital data that is not compressed. Linear PCM spreads val-
ues evenly across the range from highest to lowest, as opposed to nonlinear (companded) PCM that
allocates more values to more important frequency ranges. PCM is most commonly used for digital
encoding of audio signals.
lines of horizontal resolution 
Sometimes abbreviated as TVL (TV lines) or LoHR. A common but
subjective measurement of the visually resolvable horizontal detail of an analog video system, mea-
sured in half-cycles per picture height. Each cycle is a pair of vertical lines, one black and one white.
The measurement is usually made by viewing a test pattern to determine where the black and white
lines blur into gray. The resolution of VHS video is commonly gauged at 240 lines of horizontal reso-
lution, broadcast video at 330, laserdisc at 425, and DVD at 500 to 540. Because the measurement is
relative to picture height, the aspect ratio must be taken into account when determining the number of
vertical units (roughly equivalent to pixels) that can be displayed across the width of the display. For
example, an aspect ratio of 1.33 multiplied by 540 gives 720 pixels. 
Lo/Ro
Left only/right only. Stereo signal (no matrixed surround information). Optional downmixing
output in Dolby Digital decoders. Does not change phase, simply folds surround channels forward into
Lf and Rf.

The group first established black-and-white TV standards in 1941, using a scanning system of 525 lines
at 60 fields per second. The second committee standardized color enhancements using 525 lines at
59.94 fields per second. NTSC refers to the composite color-encoding system. The 525/59.94 scanning
system (with a 3.58-MHz color subcarrier) is identified by the letter M, and is often incorrectly referred
to as NTSC. The NTSC standard is also used in Canada, Japan, and other parts of the world. NTSC is

Q

quantize
To convert a value or range of values into a smaller value or smaller range by integer divi-
sion. Quantized values are converted back (by multiplying) to a value that is close to the original but
may not be exactly the same. Quantization is a primary technique of lossless encoding.

Red Book  The document first published in 1982 that specifies the original compact disc digital audio
format developed by Philips and Sony. 
Reed-Solomon
An error-correction encoding system that cycles data multiple times through a math-
ematical transformation in order to increase the effectiveness of the error correction, especially for
burst errors (errors concentrated closely together, as from a scratch or physical defect). DVD and BD
use rows and columns of Reed-Solomon encoding in a two-dimensional lattice, called Reed-Solomon
product code (RS-PC).
reference picture or reference frame

region code 
A code identifying one of the world regions for restricting BD or DVD-Video playback.
region playback control (RPC) 
A mandatory feature of BD and DVD-Video to restrict the playback
of a disc to a specific geographical region. BD players, DVD players, and DVD-ROM drives are each
set to a single region code, and each disc (or disc side for dual-sided DVDs) can specify in which regions
it is allowed to be played. Region coding is optional - a disc without region codes will play in all play-
ers in all regions (although for DVD the player would need to convert between 525/60 and 625/50).
render farm 
A dedicated set of processing units (computers) and data storage (hard drives) with a
software manager dedicated to processing video. A render farm may be used for encoding video. The
processors and storage can be thought of as the farm, the software manager is the farmer, and the video
encode is the crop.
replication
1) The reproduction of media such as optical discs by stamping (contrast this with dupli-
cation); 2) A process used to increase the size of an image by repeating pixels (to increase the hori-
zontal size) and/or lines (to increase the vertical size) or to increase the display rate of a video stream
by repeating frames. For example, a 360×240 pixel image can be displayed at 720×480 size by dupli-
cating each pixel on each line and then duplicating each line. In this case, the resulting image contains
blocks of four identical pixels. Obviously, image replication can cause blockiness. A 24-fps video signal
can be displayed at 72 fps by repeating each frame three times. Frame replication can cause jerkiness
of motion. Contrast this with decimation. See interpolate.
resampling
The process of converting between different spatial resolutions or different temporal res-
olutions. This can be based on a sample of the source information at a higher or lower resolution or it
can include interpolation to correct for the differences in pixel aspect ratios or to adjust for differences
in display rates.
resolution
1) A measurement of the relative detail of a digital display, typically given in pixels of width
Glossary

R

and height; 2) The capability of an imaging system to make the details of an image clearly distinguish-
able or resolvable. This includes spatial resolution (the clarity of a single image), temporal resolution
(the clarity of a moving image or moving object), and perceived resolution (the apparent resolution of
a display from the observer’s point of view). Analog video is often measured as a number of lines of
horizontal resolution over the number of scan lines. Digital video is typically measured as a number of
horizontal pixels by vertical pixels. Film is typically measured as a number of line pairs per millimeter;
3) The relative detail of any signal, such as an audio or video signal. See lines of horizontal resolution.

ible light.
RLL
Run-length-limited encoding, which modulates data to prevent long sequences of bits without a
transition (from 0-to-1 or 1-to-0). For optical drives and hard discs it is expressed as RLL(x, y), where
x is the run length (the minimum bit length before a transition) and y is the run limit (the maximum bit
length before a transition). BD uses RLL(1,7) parity preserve modulation.

R-Y, B-Y
The general term for color-difference video signals carrying red and blue color information,
where the brightness (Y’) has been subtracted from the red and blue RGB signals to create R’-Y’ and
B’-Y’ color-difference signals. Refer to Chapter 3, Technology Primer.
S/N
See signal-to-noise ratio. Also called SNR.
S/P DIF
Sony/Philips digital interface. A consumer version of the AES/EBU digital audio transmis-
sion standard. Most DVD players include S/P DIF coaxial digital audio connectors providing PCM and
encoded digital audio output.
sample
A single digital measurement of analog information or a snapshot in time of a con-
tinuous analog waveform. See sampling.
sample rate 
The number of times a digital sample is taken, measured in samples per sec-
ond, or Hertz. The more often samples are taken, the better a digital signal can represent
the original analog signal. The sampling theory states that the sampling frequency must be more than
twice the signal frequency in order to reproduce the signal without aliasing. DVD PCM audio enables
sampling rates of 48 and 96 kHz.
sample size
The number of bits used to store a sample. Also called resolution. In general, the more
bits allocated per sample, the better the reproduction of the original analog information. The audio
sample size determines the dynamic range. DVD PCM audio uses sample sizes of 16, 20, or 24 bits.

dard used in France and in parts of Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. Various version of SECAM use
different scanning systems and color subcarrier frequencies (identified with letters B, D, G, H, K, and
L), the most common being 625 lines at 50 fields per second, with color subcarriers 4.2 or 4.4 MHz. It’s
very common for video to be carried in 625/50 (PAL) format and only converted to a SECAM signal
before broadcast or output (as with DVD players with SECAM output). The other common TV sys-
tems are NTSC and PAL.
SECAMx
Sequential couleur avec mémoire/sequential color with memory. A composite color stan-
dard similar to PAL but currently used only as a transmission standard in France and a few other coun-
tries. Video is produced using the 625/50 PAL standard and is then transcoded to SECAM by the play-

telecine artist  The operator of a telecine machine. Also called a colorist.
temporal
Relating to time. The temporal component of motion video is broken into individual still
pictures. Because motion video can contain images (such as backgrounds) that do not change much

timecode
Information recorded with audio or video to indicate a position in time. This usually con-
sists of values for hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. It is also called SMPTE time-code. Some DVD-
Video material includes information to enable the player to search to a specific timecode position.
There are two types of timecode - non-drop frame and drop frame. Non-drop frame timecode is based
on 30 frames of video per second. Drop frame timecode is based on 29.97 frames of video per second.
Truth be told, there are only 29.97 frames of video per second. For short amounts of time, this dis-
crepancy is inconsequential. For longer periods of time, however, it is important. One hour of non-drop
frame timecode will be 108 frames longer than one hour of real time. See non-drop frame timecode and
drop frame timecode.

user operation (UO or UOP)    A user operation (UO in BD, UOP in DVD) is a function that a user
can perform, generally with a remote control. If a user operation is not locked or “masked,” the user
can employ it. Examples of user operations include stop, pause, fast forward, menu, and angle change.
A title may have all user operations locked during copyright warnings, as studios desire that users fully
view them. User operations may also be masked during previews of upcoming attractions that have
often come and gone by the time the user views them. This is a function of insensitive, greedy studios
that hope it will drive customers to buy more discs rather than drive them berserk.

Y
The luma or luminance component of video, which is the brightness independent of color.
Y/C
A video signal in which the brightness (luma, Y) and color (chroma, C) signals are sep-
arated. This is also called s-video.
Y’CbCr
A component digital video signal containing one luma and two chroma components. The
chroma components are usually adjusted for digital transmission according to ITU-R BT.601. DVD-
Video’s MPEG-2 encoding is based on 4:2:0 Y’CbCr signals. Y’CbCr applies only to digital video, but
it is often incorrectly used in reference to the Y’PbPr analog component outputs of DVD players.
Yellow Book 
The document produced in 1985 by Sony and Philips that extended the Red Book CD
format to include digital data for use by a computer. It is commonly called CDROM.
Y’PbPr
A component analog video signal containing one luma and two chroma components. It is
often referred to loosely as YUV or Y’, B’-Y’, R’-Y’.
YUV
In the general sense, any form of color-difference video signal containing one luma and two
chroma components. Technically, YUV is applicable only to the process of encoding component video
into composite video. See Y’CbCr and Y’PbPr.
Z
The brilliant feature film directed by Constantinos Gavras, better known as Costa-Gavras,
released in 1969 starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, Yves Montand, Irene Papas, and Jacques
Perrin. At the time this book was written the film was available only on DVD.

The entire and exclusive liability and remedy for breach of this Limited Warranty shall be limited to
replacement of defective Blu-ray Disc and shall not include or extend to any claim for or right to cover
any other damages, including but not limited to, loss of profit, data, or use of the software, or special,
incidental, or consequential damages or other similar claims, even if McGraw-Hill has been specifical-
ly advised as to the possibility of such damages. In no event will McGraw-Hill’s liability for any dam-
ages to you or any other person ever exceed the lower of suggested list price or actual price paid for the

sion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in
