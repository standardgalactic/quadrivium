Welcome
From the Editor
THIS ISSUE IN NUMBERS
Around this time of year you get lots of
predictions from tech ‘experts’ who are
paid far too much to imagine what the
future might look like. Their utopian
forecasts usually involve more robots, more
driverless cars, more talking gadgets and
so on. Rarely do they focus on the ‘boring
but useful’ stuﬀthat ordinary people rely on
– software, extensions, apps, downloads. I
guess that job falls to Computeractive, and
we’re happy to take it on. In our Cover Feature
we recommend tools (all free) that’ll be
particularly useful throughout 2018.
One tech boﬃn whose judgement I do trust
is Simon Brew, former editor of Micro Mart.
In his new Keep Your Brain Active column
(page 74) he’ll be testing brain-training
games that claim to keep you mentally ﬁt.
I hope you enjoy it.
I’d like to thank you for reading
Computeractive in 2017, and for your many
emails, which provide me with priceless
insights into what interests you. Merry
Christmas!

The top stories in the world of technology
Millions of bank customers
were using unsafe apps
Banks have been accused of
not doing enough to help
victims of online fraud, after a
damning report from MPs
revealed it’s the most prevalent
crime in England and Wales.
The Public Accounts
Committee (PAC) said victims
lose an estimated £10bn a
year. However, the true ﬁgure
may be much larger, the
In some respects, this story
is less about the vulnerability
of banking apps, and more a
testament to the strength of
the detection tool developed
by Birmingham University.
It was a semi-automated
device built speciﬁcally to
ﬁnd ﬂaws buried deep inside
apps. As we do more things
online, we’ll increasingly rely
on the ingenuity and rigour
of such tests.
COMMENT
Dr Tom Chothia, who led
the research, said it was
impossible to know whether
hackers exploited the ﬂaw. He
added: “In general the security
of the apps we examined was
very good, the vulnerabilities
we found were hard to detect,
and we could only ﬁnd so
many weaknesses due to the
new tool we developed”.
C
ustomers of some of the
UK’s leading banks,
including NatWest, HSBC and
RBS, have been using phone
and tablet apps that hackers
could have inﬁltrated to steal
log-in details.
Researchers at Birmingham
University’s School of Computer
Science ran a tool to test the
security of 400 Android and
iOS apps, including many
from banks that customers
use to check their account
and transfer money.
They found that several
banking apps contained a
critical ﬂaw that would let an
attacker connected to the
same network perform a
man-in-the-middle (MITM)
attack, intercepting what’s
being sent from the user to
the bank. Around 10 million
users are thought to have
been at risk.
The ﬂaw was identiﬁed in
the use of certiﬁcate pinning,
a technique that gives apps
and websites a guarantee they
are using a safe connection.
Hackers can use fake
certiﬁcates to impersonate
genuine sites and apps.
The researchers told the
banks aﬀected, and worked
with the Government’s
National Cyber Security
Centre to ﬁx the
vulnerabilities. In total, the
apps of nine banks contained
ﬂaws (see box below). They
have all been updated to
eradicate the ﬂaw except the
Bank of America Health app,
which hasn’t been available
since June 2017.
A spokesperson for HSBC
thanked the University of
Birmingham “for the
opportunity to work together”,
adding “we have already taken
steps to address this”.

report said, because only
around 20 per cent of crimes
are reported to the police. It
said “the emotional impact” of
the crime leaves many victims
reluctant to come forward.
The PAC blamed the Home
Oﬃce for being “too slow” to
respond to the threat of online
fraud, but also called for banks
to take greater responsibility
to tackle it, saying it’s “too
vast” a task for Government
alone.
Banks are “unwilling to
share information about the
extent of fraud with
customers”, PAC said. It urged
them to improve how it shares
information about scams, and
to oﬀer better protection to
customers.
It also described police eﬀorts
to ﬁght fraud as “inconsistent”,
and said forces “must prioritise”
the crime. Read the report at

Password-sharingMPs‘putUK

MPs have been warned they

The Information

Commons oﬃcials emailed
MPs to warn them that such
actions “put the entire
parliamentary network at risk”.

MPs themselves. Conservative
MP Nadine Dorries (pictured)

300 DRIVERS BANNED
FOR PHONE USE
Nearly 300 drivers were
banned for using mobile
phones between March and
August this year after tougher
laws were introduced. These
doubled the punishment to
six penalty points, which
is enough to disqualify
motorists with less than two
years’ experience. According
to ﬁgures released by the
DVLA, 15,752 drivers in total
received six penalty points
for using a phone between
March and August 2017, an
increase from 15,237 in the
same period in 2016.
IN BRIEF
RememberAmazon’sdrones?
Two years ago the company
revealed plans to deliver
items by air. That they’re
not buzzing around already
is largely down to safety
concerns. Amazon’s latest
plan to reassure nervous
authorities is a patent for a
drone that self-destructs
if it malfunctions. After it
breaks up, each part looks
for somewhere safe to land
- a tree, pond or park. What
could possibly go wrong?
Tomorrow’s

defending First
Secretary of State
Damian Green who
has been accused of
having pornography
on a work computer.
The Mid
Bedfordshire MP said it was
“utterly preposterous” for
police oﬃcers to assume that
because the PC was used by
Green, he was responsible for
downloading the porn. She
said that her staﬀ, including
interns, logged on to her
computer “every day”. She
added: “A frequent shout
when I manage to sit at my
desk myself is, ‘what is the
password?’”
Other MPs also admitted
sharing passwords, including
Nick Boles, who represents
Grantham and Stamford. He
said he gives access to four
members of staﬀso they can
deal with letters and
emails from
constituents. Will
Quince, MP for
Colchester, said he
leaves his computer
unlocked so staﬀcan
use it, adding: “Ultimately, I
trust my team”.
Security experts slammed
the MPs’ “cavalier” attitude
to passwords. Australian
researcher Troy Hunt, who
runs the website Have I Been
Pwned? (https://haveibeen
pwned.com), said it shows “a
fundamental lack of privacy
and security education”.
Consultant Graham Cluley
wrote on his blog (www.
snipca.com/26438): “It should
worry us all if the very people
who are tasked with
legislating on internet privacy
and security issues are proving
to be so utterly clueless”.
Google has claimed to have
invented a system that tells
you when nosey parkers are
looking over your shoulder
at your phone. Powered by
machine learning, it uses a
phone’s front-facing camera
to pick out faces that don’t
belong to the owner.
Its creators, Google
researchers Hee Jung Ryu and
Florian Schroﬀ, say it can
protect you “from onlookers in
a crowded space such as the
subway or an elevator”.
In a video they published
on YouTube (www.snipca.
com/26380), the camera on a
Google Pixel phone detects the
stranger’s face, then frames it
inside a red box (see
screenshot). It also adds
rainbow ‘vomit’, which is a
popular special eﬀect in
Google tells you when peeping toms spy
on your phone (using rainbow ‘vomit’!)
online videos.
The researchers, who call
the feature an ‘electronic
screen protector’, claim it
works in many diﬀerent
lighting conditions and with
several head poses, making it
“quick, robust, and accurate”.
They say it detects a gaze
within two milliseconds,
and identiﬁes it as a stranger
within 47. It appears to work
so quickly that even a passing
glance would be detected.
The project is experimental
at the moment, and there’s
no indication that Google will
add it to Android. But it’s a
prime example of the
company’s research into how
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) can
be used on phones and tablets.
Other AI features in
phones include tools that
automatically detect numbers
and addresses when you’re
copying and pasting text, and
suggesting pre-written replies
to your emails.

That such an obvious error
went unnoticed has revived
suspicions that Microsoft is
neglecting Windows 7 and 8.
In October, Google said that
by not applying security ﬁxes
to older operating systems
when it updated Windows 10,
Microsoft was unintentionally
leaving clues for hackers to
spot (see ‘Question of the
Fortnight’, Issue 513).
Google criticised Microsoft
for taking four months to ﬁx
ﬂaws it had spotted in
Windows 7 and 8.1.
Some users on the forum
wondered whether Windows
7 was still a priority. Juliepp
wrote: “We’re left here not

dropped us Windows 7 users

Windows 7 remains the

NHS Digital is aiming to
prevent another WannaCry-
style cyber-attack by hiring
‘ethical’ hackers to look for
weaknesses in its cyber-
defences. They will work
at a new £20m security
operations centre, simulating
attacks in a process known
as penetration testing.
The WannaCry ransomware
attack in May crippled NHS
systems in England and
Scotland, causing the
cancellation of an estimated
19,500 appointments, although
no personal data was stolen. It
highlighted how susceptible
NHS computers are to
cyber-attack.
A report in October criticised
NHS trusts for not acting on
Millions of British iPhone
users could receive hundreds
of pounds in compensation
from Google, after it was
accused of illegally accessing
people’s internet browsing
history.
A mass lawsuit brought
by consumer-rights
campaigner Richard Lloyd
alleges that between June 2011
and February 2012 Google
bypassed the privacy settings
of Safari, the iPhone’s default
web browser. He claims
Google placed cookies that
tracked users’ browsing,
allowing it to sell personalised
adverts in search results. This
‘trick’ became known as the
‘Safari Workaround’.
If successful, his case could
force Google to pay £2.7bn in
compensation to an estimated
5.4m iPhone users, who would
each receive up to £500.
It’s the ﬁrst collective legal
action in the UK, a procedure
more common in the US. It
allows many individuals to be

It follows a successful trial
this summer in tunnels and
platforms on the Waterloo

is available on platforms, but
there’s no connectivity on

GOVT EXTENDS HELP
FOR SLOW BROADBAND
The Government has
extended the Better
Broadband Scheme, which
gives people who can’t get
speeds of 2Mbps a subsidy
of up to £350 to look for
alternative solutions, such
as satellite broadband. It’s
available to homes and
businesses that can’t be
reached by faster services
and aren’t in locations where
the Government plans to roll
out 24Mbps broadband. The
scheme will now run until
the end of 2018 – a year later
than ﬁrst stated. To apply visit

HALF OF PRE	TEENS
ON SOCIAL MEDIA
Half of all children aged
11 and 12 have a social-
media account despite the
minimum age typically
being 13, according to a
new Ofcom report (www.
snipca.com/26379). It
found that four in 10 parents
have let their children set
up an account on sites like
Facebook, Instagram and
Snapchat before reaching
13. The NSPCC called for the
Government to take action,
accusing sites of “turning a
blind eye” to the problem.
IN BRIEF
advice from NHS Digital and
the Government to upgrade
out-of-date operating systems.
Dan Taylor, head of the
digital security centre at NHS
Digital, said the centre would
help the NHS anticipate future
vulnerabilities as well as block
known threats. He added it
will give “health and care
organisations additional
intelligence and support
services that they might not
otherwise be able to access”.
Security experts welcomed
the decision to use ethical
hackers, also called ‘white-
hat’ hackers, a practice already
common in companies and
public organisations that use
complex computer networks.
Cyber-criminals see such
organisations as a goldmine of
personal information, as well
as potential weak points in a
country’s infrastructure.
Independent security expert
Kevin Beaumont told the BBC
that suchmeasuresare“essential
in modern-day organisations”.
He added: “In an event like
WannaCry, the centre could
help hospitals know where
they are getting infected
from in real time, which
was a big issue. Organisations
were unsure how they were
being infected”.

I grew up in the golden age of sci-ﬁ
ﬁlms like Tron and WarGames, so
when I hear the word ‘hacker’, I picture
an audacious computer genius,
breaking into top-secret systems to take
down the bad guys from within.
Sad to say, the reality isn’t quite so
romantic. Take the case of 21-year-old
Alex Bessell from Liverpool, who’s
recently been on trial at Birmingham
Crown Court. His crime? Hacking into
Google, Skype and other big online
companies – not to right wrongs, but to
steal personal data that could then be
used for fraud.
He’s also admitted to raking in
£50,000 selling malware and botnets
– software designed to infect and

Junk oﬀender: CCleaner
If you hate junk as much as I do,
you probably already know
about CCleaner – a handy free tool we’ve
often recommended that removes
unwanted programs, ﬁles and registry
keys from your PC with just a few clicks.
CCleaner was ﬁrst released way back in
2003, but earlier this year its publisher
Piriform was bought by antivirus
company Avast. And not long after that,
junk-haters noticed something new: a
box had appeared in the CCleaner
installer, recommending that you install
Avast Free Antivirus at the same time. The
box was pre-ticked, and tucked away in
the small print at the bottom of the
window (see screenshot), a classic tactic
used by junk smugglers.
If you aren’t paying close attention, and
simply click the big blue ‘Install’ button,
you’ll end up with a complete antivirus

system you never wanted.
Let’s take a moment for that to sink in.
A program designed to keep junk oﬀyour
computer has been turned into a conduit
for unwanted software. What a betrayal.
Now, as I’ve said before, Avast Free
Antivirus isn’t exactly dangerous.
However, it’s confusing and alarming
when you suddenly see a security alert
from a program you don’t remember
installing. What’s more, Avast shows
regular pop-ups encouraging you to
upgrade to the company’s paid-for
security products. Adverts on my
desktop? No thanks.
The good news is that the latest versions
of CCleaner don’t include the sneaky
extra installer. Acknowledging that not
everyone appreciates bundled software,
Piriform says it has “paused distribution
while we improve the experience to make
it clearer to the customer how to accept
or decline the Avast oﬀer”.
Here’s a thought: if you want to
‘improve the experience’, don’t pester us
with these unwanted oﬀers in the ﬁrst
place. Let’s hope the feature remains
paused for good. And in future, to be on
the safe side, we suggest you use the
portable version of CCleaner (available
from www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds)
which comes as a ZIP ﬁle with no
installer, and therefore no junk.

Bessell may have the technical
brilliance of a 1980s movie hero, but
he’s abused his powers to get rich at

Question
ofthe
Fortnight
A
t Computeractive we’re
proud that our top
priority is helping you to stay
safe. Yes, we want to answer
your problems and give you
tips, but they won’t work on a
hacked PC. Blocking malware
comes before everything else.
So alarm bells rang when in
early December the UK’s
National Cyber Security Centre
(NCSC) advised Government
departments not to use
Russian antivirus software.
In a letter to senior civil
servants (www.snipca.com/
26504), NCSC’s chief executive
Ciaran Martin said “a Russia-
based provider should never
be used” on computer systems
dealing with information
classiﬁed “Secret and above”.
By “Russia-based provider”
he meant Kaspersky, which
has its headquarters in
Moscow. Its software has won
the past nine Computeractive
antivirus tests, the latest of
which appeared in our last
issue, coinciding with the
NCSC’s warning.
The Centre’s concern stems
from how antivirus programs
report details of attacks to its
developers. This information,
if intercepted by a hostile
government, could be used to
steal sensitive data or launch
cyber-attacks. There is no
evidence whatsoever linking
Kaspersky to the Kremlin,
but nonetheless the NCSC is
discussing with the company
how to develop “veriﬁable
measures to prevent the
transfer of UK data to the
Russian state”.
So where does that leave
our recommendation to use
Kaspersky? Should we
reappraise our verdict?
Our answer is that there’s
nothing to suggest Kaspersky is
unsafe on home computers. In
fact, all the evidence points to
the contrary. In our most
recent test it was one of only
two programs to block every
threat (Symantec’s Norton
was the other).
True, our antivirus tests have
never checked whether
Kaspersky has inﬁltrated the
UK’s corridors of power. But
time and again it has provided
the best defence for home
users against common
cyber-criminals.
If you’re happy with
Kaspersky’s protection you
should stick with it. That’s not
just our advice, but also the
NCSC’s. In a blog post (www.
snipca.com/26505) Ian Levy,
the Centre’s Technical Director,
said there’s no “compelling
case” for discouraging
individuals or businesses
from using Kaspersky.
He added: “Whatever you
do, don’t panic. For example,
we really don’t want people
doing things like ripping out
Kaspersky software”. Such
nuanced advice got drowned
out in the hysterical ‘Putin is
spying on you’ headlines.
In a bid to dispel
misinformation, Kaspersky
has launched a site (‘Can I
trust Kaspersky Lab?’, www.
snipca.com/26500) answering
key allegations. It states it has
What’sthetruthbehind
theKasperskywarnings?
Security experts told the Government to stop using it
Whatever you do, don’t panic.
We really don’t want people ripping
out Kaspersky software
“no political ties to any
government or country”, and
has never been engaged in
cyber-espionage.
One crucial point Levy
made has been largely ignored.
He said that Russia is similarly
cautious about using “Western
products”. You won’t ﬁnd
Kremlin computers running
software made by Symantec,
Malwarebytes, Trend Micro,
McAfee and many other
companies considered safe by
most UK users. But there’s no
suggestion that Symantec is
spying on people from Saint
Petersburg to Vladivostok.
Let’s be clear. Russian
hacking poses a grave threat
to the UK. Levy says Russia
will remain a danger even if
Kaspersky and the NCSC do
ﬁnd a method to verify the
security of the company’s
products. But there are no
facts linking Kaspersky -
which has oﬃces in 31
countries, and is run through
a holding company in London
- with Kremlin-backed hackers.
Unless you happen to run a
highly sensitive Government
department, there’s no reason
to stop using it.
• The UK’s National Cyber
Security Centre warned
the Government that using
Russian antivirus poses a
security risk
• The NCSC said home
users shouldn’t stop using
Kaspersky (used by 400
million people worldwide)
• Kaspersky has won the
past nine Computeractive
antivirus tests

Well, there is – it’s called Tonido Server
(www.tonido.com). The principle is you
are sharing a ﬁle or folder directly from
your computer, so it’s not on the web at
all. You right-click what you want to
share, select ‘Tonido 1-click share’, and
an http link is copied to your clipboard.
You then mail the link to as many people
as you like – and that’s it. They don’t need
Tonido themselves. When they click the
link, it opens in a browser.
The downside is that the originating
computer has to be switched on to enable
access, but that’s hardly onerous if a
group or family want to share photos of
an event, and it would be temporary. And
for non-commercial use, it’s free. I have
shared hundreds of photos (and other
ﬁles) this way without paying a penny.
For larger ﬁles, including videos, the link
becomes a download link, using the

Bus-ticket app is
a ‘running joke’
As someone who
lives near Bath,
I was very interested in
your news story (Issue
516, page 9) about First
Bus charging more for
passengers who use real
cash, rather than their
m-Tickets app (pictured).
Perhaps you’d like the
view from residents who
rely on Bath’s buses,
which is that the app is abysmal, a
running joke. You mention that the app
has a 2.3 rating on the Google Play Store.
I’m stunned it’s that high.
Fortunately, locals don’t blame each
other for the delays it causes when
boarding. It’s actually brought us closer
together, because we have a common
enemy: First Bus. It’s become a common
excuse when meeting people: ‘Sorry I
was late, it was the bus app’.
What was wrong with cash? You don’t
have to wait for a 50 pence piece to load.

Fast speeds important
when moving home
I read with interest ‘Question of
the Fortnight’ in Issue 515 (‘Is slow
broadband killing the countryside?’). As
a journalist working from home and
covering many events throughout the
year, I need decent broadband, and at the
moment I am fortunate to have 80Mbps
in Wales. I often have to upload a few
hundred images on a Monday after
editing and fast internet connections
are essential.
However my son and I want to move
from the middle of a small town, and this
is where it begins to become a pain.
In the 21st century you would think
that BT or any other provider could easily
have a list of postcodes showing speeds in
that area. There are many sites you can
type a postcode into and get a rough
idea. But doing this on lots of diﬀerent
sites when you’re looking for a property
is laborious.
We are not even fussy where we move
to. But when you ask the estate agent for
the full address and
postcode they say they’ll
only supply that
information if you want to
view the property.
I then ask what the
broadband speed is at that
address, to which they
reply: “We don’t know,
but you can look it up”.
But I need the postcode to
do that! These days an
internet connection is so
vital that you’d think it
would be an essential part of any lettings
or house sales information.

Microsoft’s Near Share not as
good as Tonido
I read with interest your news
article on Microsoft’s Near Share
(News, Issue 515, page 7) and how good it
is for sending ﬁles. But what a palaver!
Sender and receiver must be ‘nearby’,
and both must have the program.
Wouldn’t it be great if there were a
program that allowed both ends to be
anywhere in the world, and only the
sender needed the program?
Alarm clocks for kids? Wake up,
parents!
Reading that Elizabeth
Morris applauded the
headmistress of Lady Eleanor
Hollis (private) School for
providing 700 pupils with an
alarm clock, left me wide-eyed
and slack-jawed (Letters, Issue
515). Did she take this action
because she could not trust
parents to provide a clock?
(Upwards of £2 on eBay – to add to
private school fees!) Or, better still,
wake their children themselves? And
what chance is there that parents will
make sure all ‘technological
distractions’ are removed at night and
the clocks are actually used?
At 78 years of age I despair at the lack
of common-sense thinking and
self-discipline that appears to be rife in
the two generations below mine. In
post-war days of genuine austerity,
alarm clocks were expensive and hard
to ﬁnd. There was just one in our
house, so my father was my alarm –
and he very rarely ever had to call me
twice! Woolly-headed ‘non-thinking’
and ‘get a life’ are phrases that spring
to mind.

STAR LETTER
Facebook addicts took over my office
a negative eﬀect, but he
was about to retire, so he
didn’t really care. His
exact words were, ‘I’m
oﬀto Spain, it’s
your problem’.
Since Facebook
launched, nothing has
caused more conﬂict
within the oﬃce. It seems
to turn workers into
naughty pupils, trying to
do what they shouldn’t
without the teacher noticing. Things
calmed down after we blocked it on
oﬃce PCs, but then the arrival of
smartphones started another wave.
What astounds me is how today’s
workers regard using Facebook as an
essential part of daily life that even
work shouldn’t interrupt. When
confronted, they oﬀered vague
apologies, pledging to cut back. This
might last a day or two, but then
they’d be sucked back in. Needless to
say, when I considered making
redundancies, the Facebook addicts
were top of the list.
Anyway, it’s now someone else’s
problem. Like my old boss a decade
ago, I’m oﬀto sunny Spain!
Frank Burstow
In Issue 516’s
thought-
provoking ‘Question of
the Fortnight’ you asked
whether Facebook
addiction was “ruining
the UK economy”. My
answer, based on the past
10 years working in a
busy oﬃce, is absolutely!
I’ve just retired as an
oﬃce manager, head of a
department of around 30
people. From around 2000
I witnessed a gradual decline in
productivity, directly caused I
believe by the temptations presented
by the internet. It started slowly in the
early years. I could tell that some
employees were spending too long
online, but I thought that the novelty
of the internet would wear oﬀ. How
wrong I was!
By about 2005 I had to discipline
several employees for spending too
much time online during work hours.
But that was nothing compared to the
Facebook apocalypse about to hit. It
seemed that overnight the entire oﬃce
had discovered this ‘amazing’ site,
where they could ‘poke’ each other.
I warned my boss that it would have

Two-step checks cause
no-signal pain
My heart sank when I read about
plans to introduce two-factor
veriﬁcation to conﬁrm purchases online
(News, Issue 514, page 9), not least
because the mobile signal where we live
is simply not up to the job.
I will never forget the time not long ago
that I needed a validation code to access
my credit-card bill from Tesco on a new
PC. I was talking to a real human on the
phone – he said he would text me the
code (but he couldn’t see what it was
because it was so secret it’s generated
automatically somewhere in the void). He
said it would be valid for only 10 minutes.
I made him stay on the line so that he
could override the time limit. The code
arrived some 40 minutes later (we had a
nice chat while we waited).
To give them credit, Tesco now oﬀers to
send a code to a landline. But this
so-wonderful idea that we can do
everything using our mobile phones
simply won’t wash. There are still too
many people with really bad signals. It’s
another example of those who have will
be OK; those who don’t will lose out.
Elspeth Christie
There is an easy solution to the
inconvenience of two-step
veriﬁcation. Install the free software
Pushbullet (www.pushbullet.com) on
your PC and phone, link the two, and hey
presto, your veriﬁcation code will pop up
in a small window at the bottom of your
screen. It then doesn’t matter where in
the house your phone is.

It’s a ‘given’ that web giants
know our data
It is always a pleasure
to read your letters
and articles, but in Issue
515’s Cover Feature (‘What
Google, Facebook and
Amazon Know About
You’) you may be giving
strange advice. What they
know about us comes
with the territory. If you
connect to the internet,
all manner of
information about you
will be collected, and I believe most
people understand that. They may not
like it, but it is understood, a given. Your
solution to prevent this from happening
is to delete my Google account, rendering
my new Android phone useless. Delete
my Amazon account? Well, that’s the end
of my Amazon shopping for
good. Cancelling Facebook
accounts will result in
the same.
It is expected, rightly or
wrongly, that these major
corporations collect
information, so don’t use the
internet, have no email
address, and for good
measure maybe don’t have a
PC either. Where does it stop?

Q
I bought a Linx 810 Windows 10
tablet from Amazon Marketplace
trader GSM M. I tried to update
the operating system but wasn’t able to.
Linx told me I was sent the wrong tablet.
But GSM M and Amazon say that because
90 days have passed since purchase I’m
too late to return it. What can I do?
John MacDonald
A
John can make a claim with
Amazon. Following our
intervention, it has agreed to
extend the 90 days normally given by its
‘A-to-z’ guarantee (www.snipca.com/
26295). He’s entitled to a full refund from
the seller because, as Linx has conﬁrmed,
he was sent the wrong tablet. GSM M
either posted incorrect info in the product
description, or sent John the wrong tablet.
This may have been an innocent mistake,
but it’s still incompetent.
We’ve explained this to GSM M, but
haven’t heard back. The company, based
in Barking, has a good customer rating –
93 per cent positive over the past 12
months, based on 275 reviews (www.
snipca.com/26294). This rises to 96 per
cent for GSM M’s ‘lifetime’ on Amazon,
based on over 4,200 reviews. We’re
hopeful that, with a healthy
reputation to maintain,
the company will see
sense and refund John.
Can I return wrong
goods sent to me?
Martin actually paid £234
because he had a £75 cashback
deal, meaning Epson needn’t
refund the full price of £309.
However, he says the problems
led to him “wasting” more than £75 on
Epson inkjet cartridges. He’s legally
entitled to ask Epson for this, and said a
refund of £309 will cover
it. Epson is “escalating”
Martin’s case, so we hope
to have an update soon.
Q
I bought a WF-5690 printer
(pictured) from Epson for £309
in May. The ﬁrst printer became
faulty after six weeks but Epson refused a
refund saying it was allowed to replace it.
I’ve now had three replacements because
one minute Epson says I can have a refund;
then I can’t. I’m going mad – please help!
Martin Day
A
Such inconsistency could drive
any customer to the edge of
insanity. Like Currys in the case
above, Epson is legally allowed one repair
or replacement after the ﬁrst
30 days. But when the ﬁrst
replacement was found to be
faulty it should have oﬀered
Martin a full refund. Because
it didn’t, failing therefore to
comply with the Consumer
Rights Act, we think Epson owes Martin a
full refund. In normal circumstances,
after six months a retailer would be able
to deduct some money from a refund to
reﬂect how long the customer had used
the item (as in the Currys case).
There may be a problem though.
Can I get a refund after three printers broke?
Can a company force another repair
on me for a different fault?
Q
You took up my case in
July last year (Issue 474)
on the problems I’d been
having with my HP laptop bought
from Currys. Although it was
initially ﬁxed, the laptop’s been
sent back for repair three times
since then. Each time I asked for a
refund Currys refused, saying
they were allowed to carry out the
other repairs because each time
the fault was diﬀerent. Is this
allowed?
Kelvin Jones
A
No it’s not. The cycle of repeat
repairs consumers had to
endure under the Sale of Goods
Act was ended by the Consumer Rights
Act, introduced in October 2015. During
the ﬁrst 30 days you’re entitled to a full
refund for an inherent fault. After this
the retailer is allowed to carry out one
repair or oﬀer a replacement. And we
mean only one repair. It doesn’t matter
whether the second, third or
umpteenth fault is diﬀerent to the ﬁrst.
It’s disappointing that Currys doesn’t
know this, but we’re seeing a lot of
cases like this, so perhaps retailers
need to better train their staﬀabout the
change in the law (although two years
should be long enough for the message
to sink in!). If this ﬁrst repair fails,
you’re entitled to a full refund within
the ﬁrst six months and a pro rata one
after. Kelvin has had some use from the
laptop, so legally he can’t expect the
entire cost back.
We’ve contacted Dixons Carphone
Warehouse, Currys’ parent company,
about this case, explaining that Kelvin
is due a refund, or a new model. We’ll
politely mention that it would be lovely
if he received a better laptop as an
apology for the hassle he’s
put up with. We’ll let
you know if our powers
of persuasion work.

Happy BT outcomes
bring festive cheer
Two Computeractive readers will have a little
extra money to spend this Christmas after
receiving good outcomes from BT.
In Issue 513, we reported that Edmund Hobby wanted to
cancel his broadband contract after BT moved him on to a more
expensive deal without telling him. This broke one of Ofcom’s
golden rules, introduced in 2012, that providers have to warn
customers if they are to be moved to a new deal. You are given
a 14-day cooling-off period to cancel without a penalty.
Also, providers must give you 30 days’ notice of any price
increase. They can charge you should you decide to cancel your
contract early, but not if the price rise is above the rate of inflation
(which stands at 2.8 per cent: www.snipca.com/26298).
Even if the rise is below this rate, you can take your case to
an ombudsman if you believe the increase will be ‘materially
detrimental’ to you. This doesn’t just mean you’ll be worse off; it
specifically means you won’t be able to afford necessities, such
as rent, mortgage, utilities and food.
After approaching BT with this information, Edmund emailed
us to say: “Within a very short time I received an offer of a very
good deal. I should like to say thank you to Consumeractive”.
In the other case (see Issue 509) reader David Harrison
wanted to cancel his BT TV contract because the set-top box
was faulty. BT let him do this, and also said he could keep the
box to access other channels, sparing him from having to buy
another one.

PAYG services, which we
think should be made clearer.
You may remember that in
2014 Ofcom told Vodafone to
refund customers who had a
PAYG dongle, after the
company changed how often
it had to be used from every
180 days to every 30. Ofcom
said this broke the rules on
changing terms mid-contract.
As such, moving customers
to a new service when the
previous one closes breaks
Ofcom’s rules only if the
contract changes unfairly. This
isn’t the case with Vodafone
transferring Talkmobile
customers.
However, there are no
speciﬁc rules covering
unused money marooned in
an account that closes (an area
of law that needs tightening in
our view). This means Vodafone
doesn’t have to refund
customers unhappy about
moving from Talkmobile. But
perhaps sensing a PR disaster,
the company did refund
Aileen, as well as Geoﬀrey
Squires whose case we
covered in Issue 507.
Both were owed less than
£10, which probably made it
easier for Vodafone to agree
to a refund. It was more

A new type of tech-support scam that
without warning launches a phone app
– on your smartphone or PC screen –
showing a number to call to contact
a ‘support team’ (see screenshot). If
you tap or click the screen to begin the
call, you’ll ring an expensive number
and end up speaking to scammers who
will try to sell you ﬁxes for non-
existent problems.
Detected by Microsoft’s Windows
Defender Research team, this ‘click
to call’ scam targets iPhones and
Windows PCs. It’s accompanied
by an audio message that says your
device “has alerted us that your system
is infected with viruses, spywares,
and pornwares”. Next, it urges you to
call “immediately on the toll-free

TV Licence scam returns
I want to warn readers about an old
scam that’s returned. A few years ago
I received an email promising me a
refund on my TV Licence. It sounded
too good to be true, so I checked by
ringing them and they conﬁrmed it
was nonsense. I got a similar email in
early November, trying to tempt me
with a refund of £85.07. Maybe
scammers up their game near
Christmas because people like the
idea of having extra cash to spend.
The TV Licence people have a web
page warning about the scam: www.

refund information by email.

engineers can walk you

It also tries to frighten
you into calling by
claiming that it will be
“forced to disable and
suspend” your device if
you close the mesaage.
This is the latest scam
in the cat-and-mouse
game between criminals
and tech companies.
Previously, tech-support
frauds would strike as you
browsed online, plastering your screen
with pop-up alerts that say you need
to ring a number for help. Most browsers
now let you block or close these pop-ups,
thereby forcing scammers to adopt
new tactics.
How can you
stay safe?
As Microsoft points out
in its blog post (www.
snipca.com/26317),
genuine error messages
don’t contain phone
numbers, nor do
legitimate support sites
try to terrify users into
phoning. Also, never
tap or click a dialler
screen (like the one in
the screenshot) that
opens by itself.
What’s worrying is that the code
used to create this scam appears to be
from a template, meaning it’s probably
for sale on the black market. That
means it’s likely to spread and become
one of 2018’s most prevalent scams.

AUDIOEDITING SOFTWARE
Audacity has long been our favourite tool for editing audio
ﬁles. Whether you’re recording live music or dictation,
converting vinyl records and tapes to digital formats or just
cutting and mixings sounds for fun, Audacity oﬀers almost
everything you’ll ever need. It provides studio-level sound,
support for all the major audio formats and professional
multi-track editing tools – all for free. The recent version
(2.2.0) brings a welcome injection of new features, plus a
whole new look.
Those who have been using Audacity for a while will be
relieved to hear that the developers haven’t altered the
program’s interface too radically. It still looks and works like
Audacity, though there have been a number of improvements.
You can now choose from four themes, including Dark and
High Contrast. Some of the menus have been streamlined,
and new keyboard shortcuts are available for working with
clips, including Alt+P for selecting the previous clip in a
sequence and Alt+N for selecting the next one. Signiﬁcantly,
support for Midi ﬁles has been added, meaning you can now
playback them from within your projects, without the need
for extra software.
If you’ve ever found it hard to wrap your head around the
way Audacity works, you’ll be pleased to learn that the
program’s help ﬁles and manual have also had a major
overhaul. You’ll now ﬁnd several new question-mark icons
dotted around the program, each revealing instructions for
the speciﬁc tools you’re using. The program’s online manual
has also been updated with more images and better navigation.
Download Audacity from the link above – we recommend
the installer option that includes help ﬁles. The ﬁle is safe and
there are no extras to watch out for when you install it. We
also suggest downloading and installing some of Audacity’s
optional plug-ins – speciﬁcally the LAME MP3 encoder, which
allows you to export MP3 ﬁles.

What you need: Windows 7, 8/8.1 or 10
Microsoft added a useful Night Light feature to Windows 10 in
the Creators Update (released in April), but if you really value
your well-being, you may want to give CareUEyes a spin. Like
Night Light, it has an automatic blue-light ﬁlter that can make
your PC screen warmer (orangey red) and more comfortable for
your eyes, especially after dark. The tool also includes a screen
dimmer, which lets you adjust both the colour temperature and
the brightness together to achieve the best possible combination.
There are also a number of handy presets available from the
Display menu, including brightness and colour-temperature
settings for everyday situations, such as playing a game,
watching a movie, working under oﬃce lighting and so on.
The Reading setting switches your screen to black and white to
simulate E Ink. Use the built-in Rest Timer to remind you when
its time to take a screen break.

If you often ﬁnd yourself editing text while switching between
other open program windows – a web browser or ﬁle manager,
for example – you may ﬁnd OnTop Notepad very useful. It
works just like Windows Notepad, but has a couple of handy
extra features. For starters, as its name suggests, OnTop Notepad
includes an always-on-top mode. Click Window, then OnTop
and your text editor will be pinned to the forefront of your
workspace, so you won’t lose it behind other open windows.
It also has a line-numbering feature (handy for coding) and
you can quickly export your notes to PDF using the relevant

Q
I would appreciate your advice on a replacement
for AVG TuneUp Utilities. I installed this on a
laptop running XP some years ago and then
updated it to TuneUp Utilities 2014 on a Windows 8 laptop.
This laptop now runs Windows 10 and TuneUp Utilities
2014 seems to be suﬀering from the odd hiccup of late,
even though it tells me I’m running the ‘current version’.
Peter B Nunn
A
Those hiccups may become more frequent because
TuneUp Utilities 2014 was discontinued last year.
AVG says it will still work, but won’t receive any
security ﬁxes or new features. AVG’s recommendation is to
“upgrade to AVG TuneUp to enjoy full product support and
to use several additional features”. However, the latest
version of AVG TuneUp (www.snipca.com/26331) requires
a subscription, which costs £34.99 per year.
There are free alternatives to most of AVG TuneUp’s
features. If you have the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update
installed, you can set it to automatically delete junk ﬁles by
clicking Start, Settings, System, Storage, then ‘Change how
we free up space’, clicking
the ‘Storage sense’ slider
(see screenshot). You can
then choose which types of
temporary ﬁles are deleted
in the options below. You
could also install Glary
Utilities (www.glarysoft.

Startup Manager for
speeding up boot times, a
software updater, an
uninstaller and more.

i3 times two equals i5?
PC ❘£779 from PC Specialist www.snipca.com/26306
PCSpecialistEnigmaK6
You don’t have to be a mechanic to
buy a car, but most of us know a few
basics. For example, the bigger the
engine, the more oomph you’ll get when
you put your foot down. Of course, it’s
not quite that simple, and a modern
one-litre engine might do just as good a
job as a gas-guzzler of yesteryear. The
same applies with PC processor chips,
except that they tend to change faster.
In recent years, Intel’s numbering
system for processors made things
relatively simple: i3 was suitable for basic
Windows use, i5 for decent performance
and i7 for number-crunching and
creative jobs. Each year’s new versions
were a little faster than the last. Then in
2017, AMD complicated matters by
bringing out rival processors called
Ryzen. These are a bit slower than Intel’s
similarly priced i5s and i7s at basic tasks
that use one core, but a lot faster in more
demanding programs.
In case that wasn’t confusing enough,
Intel has now released its latest update,
known as Coﬀee Lake (it’s the name
of an actual lake in Wisconsin, not
what you get on your lap when
you’re distracted by a new series of
processors while drinking your morning
beverage). This is a quantum leap for
the humble i3. The i3-3800 in this new
desktop PC has four cores – twice as
many as any previous i3. This is
accompanied by a slight reduction in
clock speed, which reﬂects priorities
similar to AMD’s: you probably won’t
be too upset if processes that are fast
anyway are a fraction slower, but you’ll
be satisﬁed if tasks that usually cause
delays go much faster.
PC Specialist has taken the same
approach to the entire system: the
Enigma K6’s relatively modest CPU
comes with a very respectable graphics
card: an Nvidia GTX 1060 with 6GB of
fast memory. If you never play 3D games
or use creative software that beneﬁts
from a dedicated graphics card, you may
be better oﬀbuying a PC with a top-end
i5 or i7 processor and no graphics card
(both have built-in Intel graphics
processors that can handle general
tasks and some gaming). But if you’re
looking for a fully rounded PC, the
Enigma K6 is a good choice, as its
results in our speed tests show.
In 3D games, the GTX 1060 wasn’t held
back by the new i3, and the PC’s scores
were similar to those of the Ryzen 5
1600X-based Wired2Fire Pyro Reactor
(see Issue 516), which has the same
graphics card but costs over £200 more.
In our processor tests, the i3-3800
managed to keep up with the old i3-7100
in image editing, but in multitasking and
4K video processing, which use all the
cores, it performed as well as previous
i5-7500 PCs.
The Enigma K6 comes in a mid-sized
case with a full ATX motherboard and
plenty of room for drives, including two
M.2 sockets for fast SSDs. The only drive
ﬁtted is a 1TB ‘hybrid’ – a hard drive with
a small cache to make it faster – although
this means slower booting and loading
than if Windows 10 were installed on an
SSD. You might want to budget another
£75 or so for an SSD or an Intel Optane
card for more advanced caching. We
weren’t too keen on the case’s styling,
though, and it lacks USB 3.1 ports for
adding fast external storage.

If you’re bored with today’s
minimalist metal PCs, you
might appreciate the, um,
unique design of this new
all-in-one PC. Dell’s XPS
laptops have such slim bezels
around the screen that they
almost disappear. In contrast,
the XPS 27 not only retains
black borders but has
expanded the bottom edge
to accommodate six hefty
speakers. With this and a chunky
base, the whole thing looks as
much like a 1990s portable hi-ﬁas
it does a modern PC. On closer
inspection, the XPS27 uses more plastic
than Apple’s slender design and Asus’
bronze-metal Zen AiO, but it might have
greater appeal as an all-purpose home
PC and media centre.
One thing it does share with Apple’s
range is the eye-watering price. In fact,
the cheapest XPS 27 is £50 more than the
27in Retina 5K iMac, despite a slower
3.0GHz i5-7400 processor. Both have
8GB of memory and a 1TB hybrid drive
(a hard drive with a small cache to speed
it up), but the iMac comes with an AMD
Radeon Pro 570 graphics card, which is
an optional extra on the XPS 27. Dell’s
speakers are more than good enough to
avoid the need for a separate set – besides
the four full-range speaker drivers and
two tweeters on the front, it has two
passive radiators to pump out bass. Even
so, there’s no ignoring the fact that the
aluminium iMac is better value, and
when you consider how high Apple’s
prices are, that’s a serious concern.
The model we tested came with an Intel
i7 processor, which performed very well,
but with this plus a touchscreen, 16GB of
memory, a Radeon RX 570 and a faster
512GB SSD to replace the hybrid drive,
the price rises to £2,699. You can buy a
more powerful iMac for less, although it
won’t have Dell’s touchscreen.
The screen delivered excellent image
quality, according to our colour meter,
reproducing the whole sRGB range
accurately. We prefer Apple’s 5K screen,
though, and for this money you could
buy a desktop PC with a higher spec
and a fantastic monitor, and still have
several hundred pounds’ change.
We like the articulated stand that
comes with Dell’s touchscreen models
and lets you work with the screen almost
ﬂat, like Microsoft’s Surface Studio.
However, the XPS 27 doesn’t even support
a pressure-sensitive stylus, so what are
you going to do with it – play Solitaire?

The iPhone X is pronounced ‘iPhone 10’,
and costs £999 – yes, nine hundred and
ninety-nine pounds. To protect your
investment, Apple has made it entirely
out of glass. The front is glass. The back is
glass. There’s a bit of metal in between,
but that won’t help if you drop it on the
ﬂoor. It’s not fully waterproof, either –
just splash-resistant.
Apple charges £286 to replace the
screen. Any other damage, including a
cracked back, costs £556, if it can be ﬁxed
at all. Alternatively, when you buy your
iPhone X you can pay an extra £199 for
AppleCare+, which reduces these costs to
£25 and £79. Or you can sign up for
Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Programme,
which gives you interest-free credit for 20
months, free AppleCare+, and the option
to upgrade to next year’s iPhone. It’s
better value, but you have to go to an
Apple store for a credit check.

Apple’s ﬁrst OLED screen looks
fantastic, and the tall, narrow shape is

There’s bags of processing power. The
basic 64GB of storage is probably enough
(and it can’t be expanded), while the
face- ecognition system, which replaces
ﬁngerprint reading, is less annoying than
we feared, if rather awkward when using
Apple Pay. However, the battery lasted
just nine hours and 22 minutes in our
video playback test. Overall, this is just a
good phone, not a sell-your-grandmother
phone. Apple has hinted that more
TrueDepth cleverness will enhance it later.
Well, OK. We’ll wait, and start saving.

For now, yes. Over the next few months,

bit more for the new ones. Competition
with AMD should help bring prices down.
What’s the catch?
The new six-core
processors require new
motherboards, so PCs
featuring them won’t be cheap, and you
can’t put them into existing PCs. AMD’s
rival Ryzen processors (pictured), with
six or eight cores, have set a high bar for
desktop CPUs, and Intel will struggle
to match their performance per pound.
Ryzen laptops are available now.

What does it do?
The eighth generation of Intel’s Core
processor line brings more powerful
i3, i5 and i7 chips. Confusingly, while
previous generations have been given
one geographical codename, this has
three: Kaby Lake R, Coﬀee Lake and,
some time in 2018, Cannon Lake.
Why would I want it?
Kaby Lake increased speed by a few
per cent, but the new processors
promise much bigger gains, largely
thanks to extra cores. Desktop i3
processors were dual-core; now those
with i3-8 numbers are quad-core,
boosting performance in demanding
tasks (see page 20). The i5-8 and i7-8
chips have six cores. For laptops, four
new quad-core i5-8 and i7-8 chips with
the ‘U’ suﬃx, standing for low voltage,
promise to beat their predecessors by a
huge 40 per cent in overall performance
while helping to increase battery life.
This doesn’t feel like £1,000 of phone.
The screen doesn’t go right to the edges
like Samsung’s, and although it’s great
that there’s no border at the bottom,
there’s a weird notch at the top, where
the camera, speaker and TrueDepth
augmented reality sensors live. It’s not
quite as slim as an iPhone 8 Plus, yet the
similar dual-camera sticks out a mile. The
telephoto lens is a bit better in the X, and
its optical stabilisation improves on one
of the best ever phone cameras – but it’s
still not great in low light. The front
camera is very good, too, and now has its
own Portrait (blurred background) mode
thanks to TrueDepth, but it doesn’t work
reliably. We liked the ‘animoji’ cartoon

Now Alexa comes in various sizes
put each product in pairing mode to get
this working, but after that it’s eﬀortless.
If you have additional Echos, you can
also create a multi-room music setup over
your Wi-Fi network. Next year, Echo Plus
owners will be able to make phone calls
over a landline, but this will require an
add-on, called Echo Connect.
Priced £150 when it launched last
autumn, Amazon’s Echo was the ﬁrst
‘smart speaker’ on the market, bringing
Alexa – Amazon’s AI equivalent of
Microsoft’s Cortana or Apple’s Siri –
to your living room or kitchen. Like
everyone else, we wondered if there was
much point to a unit that replicated
something already available as an app,
and if it wasn’t a bit creepy to have a box
in your home that constantly listened
for your voice and, when addressed,
uploaded what you said to a server to
generate a response.
Well, the answers are in. People are
buying these devices, having decided that
the convenience outweighs the creepiness
(Amazon insists your communications are
secure). The Echo seems to be here to stay,
and now Amazon has updated it with a
second-generation model, Echo 2, at a
lower price, while also launching the more
advanced Echo Plus. The smaller Echo Dot
(£50) is still available, and
the Echo Spot, which builds
Alexa into an alarm clock, is
due in the New Year. Finally,
the Echo Show (£200),
which we’ll be testing soon,
adds a screen so you can
‘drop in’ for video chats
with other Alexa users.
The new Echo is shorter
than the original and comes
in a fabric or wood ﬁnish.
Its sound quality is about
the same – clear, but not
especially great for music –
although the addition of a
headphone jack lets you add
a better speaker. Volume is
controlled with buttons
rather than a twisting
mechanism at the top,
which is a shame. Slashing £60 from the
original price is welcome, though.
The Echo Plus keeps the original’s taller,
more austere design, with much-improved
speakers for a richer sound. Another
addition is a built-in hub for home
accessories that use the Zigbee standard,
such as lightbulbs and thermostats. Alexa
could already control many of these if you
added ‘skills’ (voice commands), but now
you can simply tell her to ﬁnd your Zigbee
stuﬀand control it. You have to manually

Obscenely expensive phones, scorchingly hot PCs and the return of buttons -
what we liked and disliked in 2017
Reviews
Heroes&zeroesof2017
The last 10 years have belonged to the
touchscreen, with taps and swipes replacing
clicks and key presses. Apps even mimic the
dials and sliders of synthesisers and mixing
desks. But it’s not quite the same – and this
year saw the return of the knob. Microsoft’s
Dial (www.snipca.com/26440) arrived with
the ridiculously expensive Surface Studio PC,
but also sells separately, while Logitech’s Craft
Keyboard mimics it in miniature. And while
the Nokia 3310 revived the button phone, BlackBerry’s
KEYone (pictured) brought it up to date. We’d be happy with
more to twiddle in 2018.
As 2017 began, we were just getting
used to the idea of the Amazon Echo,
a digital assistant that sat in your
home and constantly listened for your
commands. The privacy concerns
haven’t gone away, but as prices have
dropped and options have expanded,
millions of us have installed an Echo
(pictured) or Google Home. The era of
always-on artiﬁcial intelligence is
here, and, as with smartphones, we’ll
soon rely on it more than we thought.
We’ve been sceptical about Windows 10’s
drift from standard laptops to tablets and
laptop-tablets, but this year we were
almost convinced. Microsoft’s revamped
Surface Pro was expensive (from £799),
but cheaper rivals from the likes of Acer,
Asus and Lenovo showed a tablet could
be practical, while the Linx 12X64
(pictured) oﬀered a basic version for just
£200. Even two-in-ones started looking
decent, with HP’s EliteBook x360 G2
undercut by Dell’s Inspiron 13 5000
2-in-1, now with the latest quad- core
processors for well under £1,000.
“These tariﬀs are so simple, my bills are
smaller than I thought and their
customer service is brilliant,” said no BT
customer ever. But the former telecoms
monopoly showed it could innovate as
well as infuriate in 2017 when it jumped
into the latest home tech trend – mesh
routers. Not only was its Whole Home
WiFi the ﬁrst consumer option in the UK,
but its distinctive dishes remained the
best value at under £200 for three units.
Just as Kaby Lake had us giving up on
processor upgrades, along came AMD
with Ryzen, a new CPU series with lots of
cores and great performance levels.
Desktop PCs with these chips weren’t
clocked quite as fast as Intel’s, but when
we threw heavier work at them they beat
i7 performance but cost the same as i5
processors. Intel ﬁnally got its act
together with Coﬀee Lake chips that
delivered the speed boost we’d been
waiting for. As laptops catch up too, 2018
looks like a great time to buy a computer.

If you didn’t know the new processors that turned up in PCs at
the start of 2017 had been cobbled together to ﬁll in for a delay
to Intel’s plans, you’d probably have guessed. Performance
improvements were so small we barely noticed them, and laptop
battery life oddly seemed to go down rather than up. It‘s OK to
admit it when something isn’t ﬁnished, Intel. We’ll wait!
The iPhone 8 was great, but not much
diﬀerent from the iPhone 7. So to keep
its fans amused, Apple added another
model. Instead of the iPhone 9, they
called it the iPhone 10 and spelled it
‘iPhone X’. Excitingly, they made the
screen go all the way to the edge, but then
they remembered the front camera and
wedged it into an unattractive cut-out at
the top. With no room for a ﬁngerprint
sensor, they switched to face recognition.
Now you can pay £1,000 for a phone with
a chunk out of its screen that you have to
point at your head to buy a sandwich.
A screen needs more pixels if it’s bigger, but fewer if it’s further
from your face. So Full HD looks sharp in the cinema, on your
TV and smartphone. 4K, with four times more pixels, looks
brilliant in the cinema and on TV, and on a phone… well, to
detect the beneﬁt you’d have to put the phone inside your eye.
That didn’t stop Sony introducing a 4K screen on its 5.5-inch
Xperia XZ Premium. Why, Sony? Why?
As frustrated as we were by Kaby Lake
processors, Palicomp – one of the
UK-based ﬁrms that builds PCs based on
these components – had an answer:
overclocking the i5-7600K chip to a
searing 5GHz. Eyebrows were not so
much raised as singed when our tests,
designed to push PCs beyond their
comfort zone, sent the processor to
over 100°C before it turned itself oﬀ. It
worked ﬁne when slowed down a bit, as
did all the other PCs we’ve seen from
Palicomp. Ah well – if we get a cold
winter we can always sit round it.

If 2016 was the year virtual-
reality headsets ﬁnally
worked, 2017 was the year
manufacturers accepted that
only a few of us were ever
going to buy them. So they
turned from VR to AR
(augmented reality), oﬀering
apps and games that brought the
real world, via your phone camera, into tasks from ﬁnding
monsters to measuring your sofa. It’s all fun, but mostly pointless. Look
out for new tech in 2018 that makes AR a must-have! Maybe.

In Issue 516 we tested Roku’s £79
Streaming Stick Plus, which connects
your HDTV set to a range of online
video and music services including
Amazon Prime, Google, Netﬂix, Now
TV and BBC iPlayer. The Express does
basically the same thing, but comes with
a diﬀerent remote control and omits the
4K HDR capabilities of the pricier
version, sticking with regular Full HD.
Instead of plugging straight into an HDMI
socket, it comes as a tiny standalone box
that connects to the TV and the mains
with cables.
It’s so small, in fact, Roku suggests
you stick it to the edge of your TV with
double-sided tape, where you’ll barely
notice it. The catch is that the remote
control uses traditional infra-red, not
Bluetooth, which means it has to be in
sight of the box, so you can’t tuck it away
round the back. The Streaming Stick Plus’
remote control has volume buttons, but
the Express doesn’t, so you’ll have to
juggle two remotes. You can also use
Roku’s app on your smartphone to
control the Express. This app provides
a keyboard (making it easier to enter
the names of programmes and ﬁlms)
and lets you cast your own photos and
videos to the TV screen.
Unlike the Streaming Stick Plus, the
Express only supports the old 2.4GHz
Wi-Fi band, so reception may not be as
good. That’s not ideal, given the demands
of Full HD video streaming, but it should
still work ﬁne if you don’t usually have
Wi-Fi reception problems.
You’ll need reasonably fast broadband,

ALTERNATIVE: Amazon Fire TV Stick
(2017) £40 A roughly similar choice
of services – minus Google, plus
Alexa – and support for
games and apps

of course, for any internet video product.
This aside, the Express has similar
features to the Streaming Stick Plus.
In short, Roku’s software is good and
the choice of services is excellent, but
Amazon Fire’s Alexa voice search and
Android app support are missing, and
this isn’t a do-it-all TV-streaming and
games box like the Apple TV.
Q
My 10-year-old Canon Pixma
IP4500 printer has ﬁnally died
on me. It was mainly used for
the usual A4 documents, but from
time to time it was wheeled out to
print directly on to DVDs, which it did
very well. I’m looking around for a
printer to replace it that has disc
printing, but they
seem thin on
the ground.
Can you advise?
John Salmon
What’s the best model for printing to DVDs?
A
Canon’s cheapest inkjets at the
moment, the Pixma TS5150 and
TS6150, lack the disc-printing
feature, although it’s available on the
pricier TS8150 (£119 from Amazon www.
snipca.com/26347, pictured). Epson’s
older Expression Photo models can also
print discs, starting with the XP-760
(£115 from Amazon www.snipca.
com/26350). Neither of these printers is
especially fast or cheap to run, but they
do give high-quality results, including
photos, and for about the same price as
your IP4500 when it was new they
include a scanner/copier too.
At the time of writing, the recently
replaced TS8050 (see our review, Issue
504) was still available from many
shops for about £100. Without having
tested it yet, we can’t say whether the
TS8150 has any signiﬁcant advantages.
But we liked the TS8050 and it could
be your cheapest option.

the ﬁrst time, it’s waterproof, so you can
wear it swimming and it’ll track your
lengths and heart rate, although it lacks
advanced options like stroke detection
– available on specialised ﬁtness bands.
The other big innovation is built-in 4G,
which lets you connect to the internet
when you don’t have your iPhone.
With GPS already added, this makes
the Watch a fully standalone device,
but you still need an iPhone to make it
work, and if you opt for 4G both must
be on the EE network.
The Series 3 starts at £399 with 4G
or £329 without, with prices rising –
depending on size (38mm or 42mm
strap), colour, strap and ﬁnish to well
over a grand. The Series 1 (a slightly
upgraded version of the original model
without GPS or 4G) is still available
from £249.
This third version of Apple’s Watch is
hardly any diﬀerent on the outside
except for a red insert in the side knob
(or Crown) to let everyone know you’ve
bought the latest version. But on the
inside the hardware and software have
been updated, with watchOS 4 (also
available for older models) bringing Siri
voice assistance, improved health and
ﬁtness apps, and GymKit, which connects
to compatible gym equipment.
Fitness is increasingly the focus, although
the Watch is also good for notifying you
about incoming messages and letting you
take phone calls and reply to text messages
without having to get your phone out. For

screen itself is better, with high
brightness and contrast levels,
although colour accuracy is still
a bit oﬀ. Below it is a very fast
ﬁngerprint reader, with an NFC
chip for contactless payment,
and on the back is a higher-
resolution camera, which gave us
startlingly good results for a budget
phone – only letting us down in low light.
The front selﬁe camera is just OK.
Android 7.1.1 is installed, with a free
upgrade to 8.0 ‘Oreo’ coming soon, but
performance is still average for the price.
Despite a larger battery, the G5S lasted
only a few minutes over 12 hours in our
video-playback test, beating the Vodafone
Smart V8 but well short of the Samsung
Galaxy J5. Still, it will be enough for
most people, and all round the G5S is
not a bad deal at all.
If at ﬁrst you don’t succeed, as the saying
goes, keep launching diﬀerent versions
of the same phone. Motorola’s Moto G5
(see our review, Issue 500) was a
disappointing successor to the excellent
G4. The G5 Plus (see Issue 501) was better
but more expensive; and now the G5S
tries again to hit the happy medium.
At the oﬃcial £219 it’s only just good
enough, but if you can ﬁnd it discounted
to £200 or less, this model is well
worth considering.
Instead of the G5’s plastic chassis and

The TrackR Pixel is a little plastic
fob containing a Bluetooth chip to
which your smartphone will connect
when close by. You can put it on a
keyring or stick it to an object. The
point is that when it goes out of range,
its app can tell you where you had it last,
making whatever it’s attached to very
diﬃcult to lose.
Pixel gives up the ghost, a new
ﬂat CR2016 cell (£6 for 10
from Amazon www.snipca.
com/26361) will bring it
back to life.
Setting up the Pixel is easy. As
with the Tile, the app tells you roughly
where the TrackR was last detected via
your phone’s GPS, then helps you ﬁnd it
with a signal-strength meter and the
option of playing a loud noise on the
Pixel’s tiny speaker. It only works at short
range, so the app will lose track of it as
soon as you move away, and other users
will only locate it if they pass close to
it and for long enough to register. It’s
a bit slower to connect than the Tile, but
does the job.
You can set a Separation Alert to warn
you instantly if you move out of range,
but this can give a lot of false alarms. And
you can use the Pixel backwards to call a
lost phone, which makes a sound even if
it’s on silent – and this doesn’t require an
internet connection. However, this was
erratic in our tests.

Zip drive
WHAT WAS IT?
Launched in 1994 by
Iomega, the Zip drive (pictured) could
read and write removable magnetic
disks that looked a bit like 1.44MB 3.5in
ﬂoppies but could store a huge 100MB
each. It wasn’t the ﬁrst high-capacity
removable-disk system, but it was
simple and cheap enough to appeal
to consumers.
HOW HAVE THINGS CHANGED?
In 1999, Israeli company M-Systems
patented an 8MB SSD built into a USB
stick. It stored data on ﬂash memory
rather than amechanically rotating
magneticdisk.Floppiesremained the
favoured medium for everyday
backups, but as USB ports became
commonplace it was easier to share
ﬁles with other users on a ‘stick’
– and USB stick capacities kept doubling
every few months. Today, a USB 3.0
128GB stick costs around £30, storing
1,280 times as much as an original Zip
disk for the same price.
These days, external hard drives oﬀer
the lowest costs per gigabyte, while
online storage has replaced physical
devices for many sharing and backup
purposes.

What’s even better, there’s a large
community of TrackR users (this is a new
version, but they’ve been in business a
while now) that serve as extra ﬁnders.
When you activate Crowd Locate, their
phones will look for your Pixel too. If
they ﬁnd it, the app will tell you, but not
them. It’s a clever idea, and when we
logged on in London we found nearly
5,000 TrackRs nearby, which is
reassuring. Just try not to mislay
anything in the Orkney islands.
It’s a similar concept to the Tile (www.
snipca.com/19841, see our review, Issue
489), with one crucial diﬀerence – the
Pixel has a replaceable
battery. All versions of the
Tile so far are disposable
as soon as their power
runs out, which is
typically after about a
year. This means you’re

BootRacer comes as a ZIP ﬁle, so you’ll need a ﬁle-
compression program to install it (we recommend
PeaZip, www.peazip.org). To download BootRacer,
go to www.snipca.com/26358 and click the Download Now
link at the top right. Open the downloaded zipped ﬁle, click
the ‘bootracer.msi’ setup ﬁle 1 , then click Yes, Next, select
‘I accept the license agreement’ 2, click Next 3 again, then
Yes to install the program.
STEP
2
BootRacer doesn’t create a desktop icon. To do that,
search for bootracer on your PC, right-click the search
result, then click ‘Pin to Start’. Now open your Start menu
and drag its icon to your desktop. First, you need to restart your PC
to let BootRacer record its boot time. Click the Boot Time Test
button 1 , then click Yes 2. After your PC restarts, you’ll see a
pop-up displaying its boot time (in seconds) and an analysis
(Good, Average or Bad).
O
ver time you may install
many programs that
automatically start up with your
PC, thereby increasing its overall
boot time. Free program
BootRacer measures how long
your PC takes to start up and lets
you disable programs that slow
this process. The latest version
shows you all the programs that
start with your PC and how long
each one delays your PC’s start up
time, so you can remove those
that are a drag on your boot time.

Reopen BootRacer, click
‘Which programs slow
down start-up?’ 1 , then
click the Analyzing Results tab 2.
You’ll see three options 3 measuring
start time, load time and total startup
time. Start and load times are
explained on the right 4. Click Total
Startup Time 5 to see a list of all the
programs that start up with your PC.
STEP
5
Each start-up program is listed with its start-up time
1 . Select any 2, then click the ‘i’ button 3 to see its
start and load times (see Step 4) at the bottom 4. You
can safely disable or remove any third-party programs that
take too long or any you don’t use. Leave any programs that
came pre-installed or that you’re not sure about. Right-click
any program, then click Control Startup Programs.
STEP
6
In the window that opens, you’ll see a list of all the
items that start up with your PC - in the order they
start. Items at the top are typically needed to make
sure your PC starts without problems. Scroll down and you’ll
see non-Microsoft programs. You can disable these or remove
them from the list. Untick any program 1 to disable it. To
remove a program, select it, then click Delete 2. Click the
Refresh button 3 when you’ve ﬁnished.
STEP
3
Open BootRacer to see your boot
time (in seconds) 1 . You’ll see a
breakdown of the entire process at
the top, including how long your BIOS took
to load (Windows Boot) and how long before
your desktop was ready to use 2. To ﬁnd out
which programs are slowing down your
startup process, click Enable Control 3. Next,
click Enable Startup Control, tick Enabled,
then click ‘Restart your PC and Analyze
Results’. Your PC will now restart.

If you click the ‘Speed up’ button 1 on BootRacer’s
main screen, you’ll see two options - Remove Malware
and Fix Clean Boost, which we don’t recommend. The
ﬁrst option automatically downloads malware-removal tool
UnhackMe, while the second prompts you to install CCleaner
Professional. Instead, we recommend Kaspersky Internet Security
2018 (see our Reader Oﬀer, page 70) and the free version of
CCleaner (www.snipca.com/26366). Run both programs, then
restart your PC to further reduce your boot time 2.
STEP
9
Next, select the Boot
Time Trend tab 1 on
the main interface to
see a graph 2 showing your PC’s
boot times since installing
BootRacer. Click the History
button 3 to see a further
breakdown of this graph, with
your best, worst and average
startup times 4. You can print
this list or save a copy of it
(useful for comparison at a later
date). To do that, click the ‘Save
as’ button, click ‘Save to DOC’ 5,
then rename and save the ﬁle
on your PC.
STEP
10
BootRacer has a built-in tool that lets you
take a screenshot of its main interface –
useful if you want to take a screenshot of
your graph 1 . To do this, click the Advanced button 2
, then ‘Take screenshot’. In the window that opens,
use the dropdown menu to select your screenshot’s
save location 3. Name the ﬁle at the bottom 4, then
click Save 5. ●
STEP
7
By default, your PC leaves a one second gap between
starting each program or app on your PC during
startup. BootRacer lets you reduce this gap. To do this,
click BootRacer’s Advanced button 1 , click Options, then the
Startup Control tab 2. Here, change the ‘Delay between starting
apps’ time from 1000ms (milliseconds) to 500ms 3, then click
Save 4 or ‘Save and Reboot’ 5 (if you want to restart your PC
and check your new boot time).

To install the program, go to www.snipca.
com/26400, then click the ‘download
DMEX click here’ link in the Download
section at the top. Run the downloaded setup ﬁle (it
doesn’t contain any junk) until you need to click
Finish. To use DMEX, open Windows/File Explorer,
then press Ctrl+F1. You’ll see a small pop-up window
with ﬁve options 1 , each of which has further
dropdown menus. The ﬁrst option – Arrange
Explorer Windows 2 – is useful if you tend to use
many Explorer windows at once.
STEP
2
Move your cursor to it to see options to arrange two windows
horizontally, vertically, or multiple windows horizontally or
vertically 1 . If you’ve arranged windows and want to save their
alignment, click ‘Save positions’ 2. You can then click ‘Restore positions’ 3
to quickly restore this saved position. Some options have keyboard
shortcuts 4 (Strg indicates your Ctrl key, and Umsch indicates Shift). We’ll
show you how to customise these defaults and add shortcuts for other
options in Step 7. Of all DMEX’s options, File Operations has the most
features 5.
T
he free program DMEX adds a small
pop-up window that you can activate
by pressing Ctrl+F1 within any Windows/
File Explorer window. It has many useful
options that Explorer doesn’t oﬀer. For
example, you can align multiple Explorer
windows so they appear side by side,
sync contents of any two folders,
rename multiple ﬁles in one go,
access your favourite folders, and
copy the ﬁle names of any folder.
You can also create your own
keyboard shortcuts for each of
these tasks.
Add advanced tools to File Explorer
STEP
3
The ﬁrst option lets you create a
new sub-folder within the one
you’re in 1 . Synchronize Wizard
2 opens a new box where you’ll see
options to sync the contents of any two
folders. You can choose which folder you
want to sync items to, and replace or
update ﬁles in the folder you’re syncing.
DMEX also lets you move ﬁles from your
current folder to its parent folder 3 (the
folder above the one you’re in). You can
also see how much storage space that
folder is consuming 4 and how much
free space you have within the drive
you’re in 5.

We’ll now show you how to customise the program’s
default keyboard shortcuts or create your own for any
of the above tasks. Open your PC’s notiﬁcation menu,
right-click the DMEX icon 1 , then click Conﬁguration 2 to see
a list of all DMEX’s tasks. To customise/create your own
keyboard shortcut, select any task you want 3. Now press one
(or a combination of) Ctrl, Shift, Alt + a letter, number, or
Function key of your choice. Click Apply, then OK 4 to conﬁrm
your changes. The program’s ‘How to use’ website (www.
snipca.com/26401) explains all its features in further detail. ●
STEP
4
To rename multiple ﬁles in one go, press Ctrl, click to
select the ﬁles you want to rename, open DMEX, move
your cursor to File Operations, then click ‘Rename
ﬁles’. In the window that opens, you’ll see the ﬁles’ existing
names 1 and where they are stored 2. There are diﬀerent ways
you can rename your ﬁles. The easiest way is to select the
relevant dropdown menu at the bottom right, then double-click
the relevant renaming value(s) you want 3. You can also modify
the date and time when your ﬁles were created 4. Click Change
Names 5 to conﬁrm and rename your ﬁles.
STEP
5
Next, open DMEX and move your cursor to ‘Change to’.
You’ll see options to open the folder above the one
you’re in 1 or the drive it’s in 2. Clicking Drive 3 lists
all the drives on your PC. Click one to open it. One of the
program’s most useful tools is the option to add a list of folders
you access often to the ‘Change to’ menu. To do this, open the
ﬁrst folder you want, click ‘Add current path’ 4, then click
Accept. Repeat this to add other folders 5. You can rearrange
their order by clicking ‘Conﬁgure paths’ at the bottom.
STEP
6
Select any ﬁles within a folder, open DMEX, then move
your cursor to Clipboard 1 . You’ll see the option to
copy the ﬁle paths, names or both 2. Alternatively, to
only copy ﬁle names, click Collect 3 to open a small box at the
bottom right, then drag and drop ﬁles into it. There are diﬀerent
ways to paste this copied data. Open another folder, then click
‘Paste to ﬁle’ 4 to create a new notepad ﬁle with your copied
data. Alternatively, to only paste this data into another program
(such as Word or Outlook), simply open that program, then
press Ctrl+V.

STEP
1
Install and open the
app (www.snipca.
com/26338), tap
Agree, Allow, then OK 1 . At
the top, you’ll see how much
of your storage space you’ve
used 2. The app has two main
sections - Storage and Files 3.
In the ‘Duplicate ﬁles’ section
you’ll see how much space
you can free up by deleting
those ﬁles 4. Tap this to see all
your duplicate ﬁles - photos,
videos, music, PDFs and
downloads. By default, these
are displayed as large
thumbnails.
STEP
2
Tap the View icon 1
to see them as a list,
with ﬁle size and
date saved. The Sort icon 2
lets you sort these ﬁles by
name, date or size. Tick
‘Smart suggestions’ 3 to
delete the older versions of all
your duplicates (untick any
duplicates you want to
retain). At the top, you’ll now
see how much space you can
free up by deleting your
selected ﬁles 4. Tap Delete 5,
then Delete again to conﬁrm.
You’ll see a summary of how
much space you’ve regained.
Now return to the main
section.
STEP
3
The app also lets you identify and delete
your apps’ temporary ﬁles 1 , plus ﬁles
you’ve downloaded 2 and ‘large’ ﬁles (over
10MB) 3. In each case you’ll see how much storage
space you can regain by deleting them 4. Tap a
section and – as in Step 2 – you’ll see two buttons at
the top right to change your view and sort your list.
To delete all listed ﬁles in one go, tick ‘All items’ at
the top. You can then untick any items you want to
retain. Finally, tap Delete, then tap Delete again to
see how much space you have recovered.
G
oogle recently released a handy, free
Android app called Files Go that lets
you ﬁnd and delete ﬁles that are taking
up storage space, including duplicates
and downloads. It also identiﬁes which
apps haven’t been used in the last
month, so you can uninstall any you no
longer need in one go. The app is a beta
version but it worked perfectly well on
our phone, helping us recover more than
10GB in a matter of minutes and making
it noticeably faster.

On the main screen, you’ll also see sections for apps that
download ﬁles to your device, including WhatsApp and
Skype. This is useful because apps like WhatsApp don’t
display all the media ﬁles it downloads in one convenient location.
Select the apps on the main screen, then as in Step 2, adjust the
view and sort settings 1 to suit your needs. Tick ‘All items’ 2, untick
any you want to retain, tap Delete 3, then Delete again to conﬁrm.
We recovered about 2.5GB by deleting 3,219 unwanted ﬁles 4 from
WhatsApp alone.
STEP
6
Next, tap the Files
tab 1 . You’ll see
seven options –
Downloads, ‘Received ﬁles’,
Apps, Images, Videos, Audio
and Documents 2. Tap any of
these to see further options.
For example, tap Videos 3 to
see all videos on your device,
as well as tabs at the top to
see videos you’ve created or
downloaded using speciﬁc
apps – your Camera, WhatsApp,
Skype, email and so on (see
screenshot in Step 7).
STEP
7
It’s easy to share or delete multiple items at once
from any of these tabs. First, tap and hold an item
to select it 1 , then tap other items you want to
share or delete 2. To share them, tap the share icon 3, then
select the app you want to use. To delete items, tap the bin
icon 4, then tap Delete. Alternatively, select one item, then
tap the three dots 5 to see options to rename the ﬁle or see
information about it (location, ﬁle size and date you
created/downloaded it). ●
STEP
5
Next, tap the Find Unused Apps section. You now
need to grant Files Go permissions, so tap Go To
Settings to open the ‘Apps with usage access’
section 1 . Tap Files Go 2, then tap the ‘Usage access’ slider
to turn it on. Tap the back button 3 to return to the app,
then tap the ‘Unused apps’ section. You’ll now see a list of
apps you haven’t used for a month (and the date you last
did). Tap to select the apps you don’t use (or tap ‘All items’
at the top), then tap Uninstall. You’ll need to tap OK to
conﬁrm uninstalling each app one at a time.

SCREEN CAPTURE
Capture screenshots on any
Windows version
I’ve read about many screenshot
programs in the pages of
Computeractive. Most of these seem a
little too complicated for me. The one
I’ve been using for many years (from XP
onwards) is a tiny tool called MWSnap
(www.snipca.com/26321). Install and
open it. Next, click ‘Any rect. Area’ on the
left, then click the ‘Snap any area’ button
at the bottom (see screenshot below).
Your PC screen will appear zoomed in
(slightly larger) so you get a better view
of things. Click and drag your cursor to
select the area of your screen that you
want to capture (this will open in
MWSnap). To save your ﬁle, click the File
tab at the top left, ‘Save as’, change the
‘Save as type’ dropdown menu to PNG,
then rename and save the screenshot
on your PC.

SOUND PROBLEMS
Restore audio to your PC
About four months ago, my 10-
year-old Dell desktop PC suddenly
lost all sound. I carried out all the usual
checks - checking cables, updating
drivers and so on, but nothing worked.
I even replaced the sound card and tried
a USB plug-in sound card, to no avail.
Then a few days ago, I came across
‘Tweaking.com Windows Repair’
(www.snipca.com/26322). I remembered
reading about it in Computeractive,
so I decided to try it.
Open the program, click the ‘Repairs -
Main’ tab, then click the Open Repairs
button. Next, tick Restart/Shutdown
System, then choose whether you want it
to restart or shut down after the scan.
Finally, click Start Repairs at the bottom
(see screenshot above right).
The whole scan took about three hours,
most of which appeared to be ﬁxing
registry errors and reorganising ﬁles on
my drive. When I switched on my PC
after the scan, my desktop screen came
on, followed by Windows’ familiar ‘Ding
Ding Ding Ding!’ welcome sound.
I had my audio back. So I have to thank
Tweaking.com for such a fantastic repair
program, and you, for a truly great
magazine and all the superb free
programs you regularly recommend.

iOS
Reach iPhone apps at top of
your screen more easily
I have short thumbs so I ﬁnd it
diﬃcult to reach icons at the top of
my iPhone’s screen when using it with
one hand. I recently discovered a useful
feature (called Reachability) that shrinks
your iPhone screen and slides it toward
the bottom, thereby giving you easier
access to icons at the top. To use it, simply
double-press the Home button. Repeat
this action to return your screen to normal.

PhoneandTabletTips Brilliant things to do on your device
iOS
Find types of emails quickly
and change your settings
There’s an easy way to quickly ﬁnd
speciﬁc types of emails in iOS’s
Mail app. Open the app, then tap
Inbox at the top left to see your emails (in
the left-hand column on an iPad). At the
bottom left, you’ll see a small circular
icon with three lines (see screenshot
right). Tapping it displays all your Unread
emails. However, it’s easy to customise
this button to see other emails. First, tap
the small circular icon, then tap the
Unread link at the bottom.
You’ll see six options in the Filter
pop-up menu (see screenshot right). By
default, Unread is the only one ticked,
but you can select any of the ﬁlter options
you want to include here. When you’ve
ﬁnished, tap the Done button. Your email
list will now change to reﬂect the changes
you made. From now on, whenever you
tap the circular icon, you’ll see the emails
based on the ﬁlters you selected.
To change the Mail app’s default
settings, you need to open the Settings
app on your device, then tap Mail. Here,
you’ll see options to increase the number
of lines in your email message preview
from the default two, and customise what
swiping across emails in your list does.
By default, all sent emails have a ‘Sent
from my iPad/iPhone’ signature. To
change this, scroll to the bottom of Mail
in Settings, tap Signature, delete the
default text and type what you want.

data you’ve used at any
time, open Settings, tap
‘Network & Internet’, ‘Mobile data’, then
‘Data usage’. On iOS, tap ‘Mobile data’,
then Usage in Settings. You’ll see how
much data you’ve used in the current
calendar month. By default, this starts on
the ﬁrst day of the month, but you should
change this to the date from when your
mobile service provider bills you. You can
check this date by opening your service
provider’s app or by contacting them.
Three (Android www.snipca.com/26411;
iOS www.snipca.com/26412) has updated
its apps with a new feature that lets you
monitor how much data, call minutes
and texts you’ve used over the past four
months. Open the app to see three graphs
– Data (in GB), Voice (in minutes) and
Texts (total number) – which display
what you’ve used in your current billing
cycle. At the bottom of the graph, you’ll
see how many days it is before your data
allowance renews.
Tap any of the three graphs to see your
usage over the past four months as bars.
At the top, you’ll see your average
monthly and highest consumption. The
red line at the top indicates your data
limit. If you regularly exceed your limit,
you should consider switching to another
mobile plan or using Google’s new app,
Datally (see Best New Apps below), which
will help you save mobile data.

Zipping and unzipping files
Hide ZIP ﬁles within photos, password-protect sensitive ﬁles, automatically
extract them to speciﬁc folders and more
Unzip ﬁles to speciﬁc folders
Our favourite free archive tool, PeaZip
(www.peazip.org) has some great hidden
features, including shortcuts that let you
unzip ﬁles to your favourite folders. Open
PeaZip and navigate to a folder you want
to add as a favourite. Right-click the
folder and select Navigation, then ‘Add to
bookmarks’ (see screenshot above). You’ll
see your folder listed under Bookmarks.
Note where the folder appears in the list.
If it’s the sixth bookmark from the top,
for example, you can use the keyboard
shortcut Ctrl+6 to extract the contents
of any ﬁle directly into that folder.
Password-protect your ﬁles
To hide a ﬁle from prying eyes, you
can add it to an encrypted archive. In
PeaZip, browse to the ﬁle you want to
encrypt, click it, then click Add. In the
box that opens, select a format from the
dropdown menu, then click ‘Enter
password/keyﬁle’. Type and conﬁrm your
password (see screenshot below), and
click OK twice. Now, only people with
the password can unzip the ﬁle.
Automatically name
a ZIP ﬁle after a speciﬁc ﬁle
When you use Windows’ built-in
compression tool to unzip a group of
ﬁles, you often seem to end up with a
ZIP ﬁle that’s named after a random ﬁle
in your group. There is, in fact, a hidden
way to control how Windows names your
ZIP ﬁles. Open File Explorer, locate your
ﬁles and drag (or Ctrl+click) to select
those you want to zip. Now, when you
right-click your selection to access the
‘Send to’ option, make sure you click the
speciﬁc ﬁle you want to name your ZIP
after. Select ‘Send to’, then ‘Compressed
(zipped) folder)’ (see screenshot above
right) and your ZIP ﬁle will be named
after the ﬁle you right-clicked.
Hide a ZIP ﬁle within an image
You can use command prompt to
disguise a ZIP ﬁle as an innocent-looking
picture ﬁle. First, ﬁnd an image ﬁle –
any JPEG, PNG or GIF will do – and place
it on your desktop. Now ﬁnd a ZIP ﬁle
and put this on the desktop, too. Rename
the ﬁles so there are no spaces in the
names. If your image ﬁle is called ‘My
image.png’, for example, right-click
it, select Rename and change it to
Myimage.png.
Now click Start, type cmd and
press Enter. At the command prompt,
type cd desktop and press Enter. Then
type copy /B Myimage.png+Myzipﬁle.zip
Newimage.png Myimage.png (cut and
paste this from www.pastebin.com/
J3RGJR9r), where Myimage.png and
Myzipﬁle.zip are the names of your image
and ZIP ﬁles, and Newimage.png is the
name of the ﬁle you’re creating.
Press Enter and Newimage.png
will appear on your desktop. The ﬁle
works like a normal image ﬁle, so you
can view it in an image-editing program.
To reveal the hidden ﬁles, open PeaZip
(see next tip), navigate to the image
ﬁle, then right-click it and select ‘Open
as archive’.
PeaZip support lots of diﬀerent archive
ﬁle types and includes the useful ability
to convert from one to another without

you having to extract the contents ﬁrst.
For example, if you have a RAR or 7z
ﬁle that you want to share with a friend
but you’re not sure whether they’ll
have a tool to extract its contents, you
could convert it to a ZIP ﬁle (which
Windows can extract without any extra
tools). Locate your ﬁle in File Explorer,
right-click it and select PeaZip, then
Convert. In the bottom pane of the
window that opens, select the format
you want to convert to – ZIP, for
example – from the top dropdown
menu, then click OK.

What is it?
It’s an artiﬁcially intelligent chatbot
that has been set up by New Zealand
security ﬁrm Netsafe (www.netsafe.
org.nz) to reply to scam emails
automatically.
What’s the point of that?
The idea is that the chatbot’s replies
look like they’re coming from an
actual ﬂesh-and-blood person –
complete with typing mistakes, lame
jokes and so on – stringing the
scammers along by fooling them
into thinking you’re falling for their
con trick. By wasting their time with
a series of back-and-forth emails that
never go anywhere, the theory is that the
scammers have less time to spend on
scamming actual people. Plus, you’ll get a
a satisfying sense of turning the tables on
the bad guys.
How does it work?
When you next receive a suspicious email
promising you a miraculous and
unexpected inheritance or an unmissable
overseas investment opportunity (or
similar), forward it to me@rescam.org
before dropping it into your junk folder.
The email will be analysed and, if it’s
found to be a phishing scam, you’ll
receive a conﬁrmation email, along with
an invitation to view the hilarious
conversation between the chatbot and
the scammer.
Re:scam’s chatbot will then assume
one of its human personalities and begin
communicating with the scammer, under
the guise of someone that’s been duped
by the phishing email. In order to seem
Re:scam
Get your own back on
scammers for wasting your
time… by wasting theirs instead
convincing, Re:scam will sometimes set
your email aside for a period of time
before replying.
You can read some brilliantly funny
example conversations by clicking ‘Can
you show me?’ at www.rescam.org.
Is it safe?
Yes. We always advise never to reply to
scam emails but, technically speaking,
you’re not the one replying – the Re:scam
chatbot is. Your personal email is never
used to contact the scammers – all
communication is done via a proxy
account. When you view the email
conversation online, you may see your
name, email address and your own
comments in the message thread, but all
of this information is stripped from the
emails before Re:scam contacts the
scammer. You might still see it, but the
scammer can’t.
How eﬀective is it?
Re:scam is never going to bring an end to
phishing scams,
but that’s not the
intention. It’s all
about sending the
scammers on a
wild goose chase
and disrupting
their operations.
So far, Re:Scam’s
chatbots have sent
almost half a
million emails to
scammers (see
screenshot below left), which Netsafe
estimates would equate to wasting
around four and a half years’ worth of
scammers’ time. Netsafe also believes that
by communicating with scammers, it can
learn more about their activities,
locations and methods.
Can it be used to check
whether an email is fake?
Re:scam doesn’t recommend this,
admitting that its own systems aren’t 100
per cent foolproof. If you’re ever in any
doubt as to whether an email you receive
from your bank or any other service
you’re registered with is legitimate, it’s
best to contact the relevant company
directly.
Can I unsubscribe?
You don’t need to sign up to use Re:scam,
but if you forward a scam to the service,
you will continue to receive emails from
it, unless you opt out. This is done by
clicking the Unsubscribe link at the
bottom of the email. Even after you’ve
unsubscribed, you can continue
forwarding phishing emails to the
service.

It’s time to get your computer, phone and tablet fit for 2018.
Software expert Jonathan Parkyn
Jonathan Parkyn reveals free tools and
downloads that will prove indispensable
throughout the year ahead
intro to come
T
echnology is changing so fast it
can feel bewildering. Every year
sees new devices, threats,
software and apps that make it
seem like we’re in a sci-ﬁfuture as
imagined in the 1960s (minus ﬂying cars).
It’s hard to make predictions beyond
the next few months, but we can make
good assumptions about how you can
prepare yourself for 2018, helping you
thrive no matter what Microsoft, Google
and others throw at you. Which is why
we’ve prepared this guide to the free
software, apps and downloads we think
you’ll need.
Some of these tools will be new to you,
others will be old favourites. But they’ve
all got something special that’ll make
them essential in 2018. Several are
excellent replacements for programs that
are due to close. There are also tools that
put you back in control of your PC should
Microsoft’s upcoming changes not suit
you. And we couldn’t ignore security
software that will protect you from 2018’s
biggest threats.
But there’s more to download from the
web than programs. In the ﬁnal section of
this feature we recommend a miscellany
of downloadable treats that will prove
more useful than ever next year. These
include free fonts, maps, BBC shows,
photos and Windows 10 themes.
Before you get started, we recommend
you install a tool that automatically
updates software to the latest (and
theoretically safest) version. Our choice is
Kaspersky Software Updater, which is
free from www.snipca.com/26410. You
already have this tool if Kaspersky
Internet Security (winner of our past nine
antivirus tests) is installed on your
computer. If not, please turn to page 68
for our exclusive reader oﬀer, which
knocks 43 per cent oﬀthe price.

1 WPS Oﬃce
LibreOﬃce (www.libreoﬃce.org)
is still one of our favourite free
programs. But in 2018, as the line
between PCs, tablets and phones continues
to blur, we think you’ll need an oﬃce
suite that you can use across all your
devices and operating systems. WPS
Oﬃce (www.wps.com/oﬃce-free, see
screenshot right) ﬁts the bill. It’s a free
oﬃce suite that looks and works much
like modern versions of Microsoft Oﬃce,
and runs on Windows, iOS and Android.
It gives you 1GB free online storage to
share and sync ﬁles between your
devices, though you can also use other
services like Dropbox and OneDrive.
Currently, this works with Windows and
iOS only, but WPS has promised to make
it available for Android users soon.
Free use of WPS Oﬃce is supported by
adverts, but these are rarely intrusive and
it’s a small price to pay for such a brilliant
multi-device oﬃce suite.
2 EaseUS ToDo Backup Free
and Google Backup and Sync
CrashPlan (www.
crashplan.com), one of
the best free backup
tools, is closing its home-user services in
October 2018 to refocus on business
customers. This is a massive shame,
because it provided a useful way to back
up your ﬁles securely to an external hard
drive, as well as to someone else’s
computer over the internet, without
having to pay a sausage. This meant you
always had local (on your PC) and oﬀ-site
(someone else’s computer or online)
copies of your ﬁles. It’s a good way to
protect yourself against ransomware,
theft, ﬁre, hardware failure - almost
anything in fact, except a meteor strike.
Currently, there’s no direct free
equivalent. CrashPlan recommends
switching to Carbonite (www.carbonite.
com), but this costs a minimum of £45
per year. Instead, you can use a
combination of free tools to achieve a
similar level of protection. We
recommend using EaseUS ToDo Backup
Free (www.snipca.com/26368) for your
local backups. Just make sure you untick
the option to install any additional tools
when you run the installer.
Crucially, EaseUS ToDo Backup Free
supports ﬁle versioning, which keeps
previous versions of saved ﬁles, giving
you a lifeline if attacked by ransomware.
Click File Backup, ‘Image-reserve
strategy’, then tick ‘Enable image reserve
strategy’ and enter the number of
backups you want to preserve (‘4’ in the
screenshot below left). For your oﬀ-site
backup, we’d recommend using Backup
and Sync (www.snipca.com/26369),
Google’s new, simple tool for syncing ﬁles
with Google Drive. Also consider Veeam
Agent (see page 58).
3 MediaMonkey
Microsoft’s Groove Music app
leaves a lot to be desired. Its
interface is simplistic, awkward
to navigate and – amazingly – lacks even
basic features, like the ability to rip music
from CDs. Sadly, Microsoft shows no sign
of improving it. In fact, on 31 December
Microsoft will remove its music-
streaming features and online store.
Launch Groove Music and you’ll see a
warning telling you to download any
purchases you’ve made before that date,
or you’ll lose them forever.
There are many other, much better
music players available, including
MediaMonkey (www.mediamonkey.
com). Packed with features, it makes
browsing your collection easy, and
supports dozens of audio-ﬁle formats, as
well as podcasts. You can also ask it to
automatically add album cover art and
lyrics to your ﬁles.
MediaMonkey doesn’t have its own
built-in music store, but it can sync with
your phone or tablet (a recent update
makes it work with Android 8 and iOS
11). This means you can shop for tunes on
your mobile device and transfer them
easily to your PC.

60,000 years. In July 2018, it will get
almost as close - just 35.8 million miles
away. That’s all the excuse you should
need to download the outstanding
astronomy program Stellarium (see

Nasa’s Parker Solar Probe, also in July,
sounds exciting (go to www.nasa.gov/

download will begin automatically).
You’ll then be able to explore a 3D
simulation of the night sky. Stellarium
was recently updated, adding moons of
Saturn, Uranus and Pluto.

OTHER WINDOWS 10
CHANGES IN 2018
As well as more design tweaks, the
Redstone 4 update (due March) is likely
to include Near Share, letting you send
ﬁles between nearby computers using
Bluetooth (though not to everyone’s
liking – see James Gourley’s letter on
page 12). There will be new tools added
to Edge too, including (hopefully) the
ability to mute audio coming from a
speciﬁc tab, and saving ebooks in the
EPUB format. Cortana, rapidly becoming
an essential Windows tool, will have
a new Collections section suggesting
things you’ve shown an interest in, such
as books, TV shows and recipes.
Click ‘Run Sandboxed’ to run programs safely
on your PC
You can add items to your Christmas list using
Xodo’s annotation tool
5 Start Menu X
Sadly, it looks like one of
our favourite free tools may well
be heading for that big cloud
server in the sky next year. The creators
of Classic Shell recently decided to stop
developing it after eight years, citing lack
of time and Windows 10’s frequent updates
as two of the main factors. Originally
built to replace the sorely missed Start
menu in Windows 8, Classic Shell had
continued to be popular with Windows
10 users because of its option to restore a
more traditional Start menu to the
operating system, as well as providing
many clever ways to tweak the interface.
The source code for the last version of
Classic Shell – version 4.3.1 – has been
posted online in the hope that someone
may continue developing it. But,
ultimately, if no further updates are made
available, then Classic Shell will eventually
become unsafe and may stop working
when Windows 10 is next updated.
StartIsBack+ (http://startisback.com) and
Start 10 (www.snipca.com/26434) are
both good replacements, but cost money.
The best free option is probably Start
Menu X (www.startmenux.com, see
screenshot above right), which doesn’t
have as many features but lets you choose
a ‘classic’ menu style and customise its
look and feel.
6 Sandboxie
One of 2017’s most successful
(for the bad guys) and shocking
(for the rest of us) security scares
was September’s CCleaner hack, where
malware was found in the popular
PC-cleaning tool. The infected update is
thought to have been installed by more
than 2.27 million users. That such a
respectable tool could be inﬁltrated
highlights how diﬃcult it is to know
which programs you can trust. Hackers
aren’t stupid. They’ll always look for ﬂaws
in programs used by millions.
An extreme response is to never install
software again, maybe encasing your
computer in concrete just to be sure.
A more reasonable reaction is to use
Sandboxie (www.snipca.com/26372).
This ring-fences any programs you install,
preventing them from harming your PC.
Instead of running them as normal,
right-click the program ﬁle or shortcut
and select Run Sandboxed (see
screenshot below left). Sandboxie is free
to use, though after 30 days you’ll be
occasionally pestered to buy a licence.
7 Foxit PDF Reader or Xodo
With little fanfare
(probably hoping nobody
would notice) Microsoft
has revealed it will be retiring Reader, its
Windows 10 PDF reader app, on 15
February 2018. The company’s somewhat
unhelpful advice is to switch to using
Microsoft Edge for reading PDFs. Edge
has a handful of PDF-friendly tricks up
its sleeve – you can annotate documents,
for example – but it’s clearly no match
for a dedicated PDF tool. Instead, you
could go for Foxit Reader 9.0 (www.
foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader), which has
more features than Basil Brush has ‘boom
booms’. These include new keyboard
shortcuts (using just one key - no need to
press the Windows key), and the Reﬂow
Mode, which reformats the text in a PDF
when you zoom in.
As a downloadable program, Foxit isn’t
an exact like-for-like replacement for
Microsoft’s desktop app. If that’s what
you want, get the free Xodo PDF Reader &
Editor from the Windows Store (www.
snipca.com/26370). Its annotation tool is
very easy to use (see screenshot left).

8 Microsoft Launcher
In October, Joe Belﬁore, a vice
president in the Operating
Systems Group at Microsoft,
oﬃcially admitted via a series of tweets
that the company was no longer working
on Windows Phone (www.snipca.com/
26399). It wasn’t much of a surprise,
given how the company’s mobile
business has ﬂoundered in recent years,
unable to compete with Apple and
Google (which makes Android).
But you can keep Windows Phone alive
in 2018 by installing the brilliant
Microsoft Launcher app for Android
phones and tablets (www.snipca.
com/26381, see screenshot below). It lets
you customise your device’s interface
with new styles, and gives you the option
to tie your Microsoft account to your
phone. This is
particularly
useful because
Windows 10’s
new ‘Continue
on PC’ feature
is built into the
app, allowing
you to ‘send’
(without the
need to email)
web pages,
photos and
more to your
computer.
9 TVCatchup
2018 is going to be a bumper year
for must-watch live TV. BBC and
ITV are likely to have the best
coverage of the royal wedding in May,
while the broadcast rights to the football
World Cup in June and July are also
shared between the two channels.
The best app for tuning in live is
TVCatchup (Android www.snipca.com/
26382; iOS www.snipca.com/26383, see
screenshot right), which is essentially an
unoﬃcial Freeview streaming service
that lets you watch TV broadcasts over
the internet. It’s a great app, though
perhaps it should change its name to
reﬂect that it oﬀers more than just
‘catch-up’ TV.
10 Radioplayer
You may already have TuneIn
Radio installed on your device.
And, like us, you may also have
become increasingly frustrated with the
needless extras that have been recently
added to this once-great radio-streaming
app. Podcasts, US sports coverage,
audiobooks and more besides have started
crowding out the radio stations themselves.
In the spirit of decluttering your life for
2018, we recommend switching to
Radioplayer (Android www.snipca.
com/26384; iOS www.snipca.com/26385,
see screenshot above right), an oﬃcial,
BBC-supported app with live streams and
catch-up content from hundreds of local
and national radio stations. It’s sleek,
reliable and all about radio.
11 Fing
In the wake of the Krack WPA2
ﬂaw (see ‘What’s All the Fuss
About?’, Issue 515), we’ll need to
spend 2018 being wary of shady intruders
on our Wi-Fi network. Fing (Android
www.snipca.com/26386; iOS www.
snipca.com/26387) is a network scanner
that lets you check for unauthorised
Wi-Fi connections. It’s easy to use,
though works slightly better on Android
devices because iOS 11 can’t read MAC
addresses, making it harder to identify
what device is invading your network.
We don’t yet know what the ‘P’ in
Android ‘P’ (9.0) will stand for
(Pancake? Peanut Butter
Sandwich?). But while there will almost
certainly be a new version of Android in
2018 (around August, probably), many
Android users haven’t even been updated
to Android Oreo (8.0) yet, despite it being
released in August.
Samsung is rumoured to be releasing it
for Galaxy devices some time in early
2018. But if you can’t wait, or if your phone
or tablet just doesn’t support the update,
then consider installing apps right now
that add Oreo’s superb new features to
your device. Want a taste of Oreo’s
picture-in-picture abilities, for example?
Then install Floating Apps Free (www.
snipca.com/26389, see screenshot). Or

On some devices, it’s possible to match
another key Oreo feature by installing
Night Mode Enabler (www.snipca.

12 HTTPS Everywhere
Most security experts agree that
the best way to combat Krack is
for manufacturers to release
ﬁrmware updates that ﬁx the vulnerability
in their devices. But while many
manufacturers – including Microsoft –
have been quick to do this, others are
dragging their heels, meaning Krack is
likely to cast a shadow that stretches
well into 2018. In the meantime, we
recommend installing HTTPS Everywhere
(for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Android:
www.snipca.com/26393, see screenshot
right), which encrypts your connection to
web pages – even ones that don’t
implement encryption by default – and
makes it impossible for hackers to
intercept your browsing.
13 Data Saver and Pocket
Chrome has been the
world’s most popular
browser for many years,
but Mozilla’s new Firefox Quantum oﬀers
advantages that make it highly tempting.
It’s fast, more secure and oﬀers a number
of useful new features, such as its built-in
Pocket tool that saves web pages for later.
But if you want to stick with Chrome in
2018, you can install some extensions that
help it match Firefox Quantum’s new
super powers. Google’s own Data Saver
(www.snipca.com/26394) extension
speeds up browsing by compressing
web-page content before it’s delivered to
your PC. It shows in a graph how much
data is being used (see screenshot above
right), and how much you can save. And
Pocket is available for Chrome too – get it
from www.snipca.com/26395.
14 Cookie AutoDelete
2018 will see the implementation
of new data-protection laws
(General Data Protection
Regulation) that will give UK citizens
more control over what happens to personal
information collected by tech companies.
Under the current proposals, people will

Google’s Data Saver shows you how much

have the right to be ‘forgotten’ online by
withdrawing consent or deleting personal
data, including browser cookies. Until
then, you could install Cookie AutoDelete
(Chrome www.snipca.com/26397;
Firefox www.snipca.com/ 26398, see
screenshot), which automatically deletes
unused cookies whenever you close a tab.
15 Free media codecs
from Microsoft
Windows 10 comes with built-in
support for dozens of audio and
video-ﬁle formats. But to play
ﬁles in unsupported formats you need to
install special codec packs or multi-
format media players, such as VLC (www.
videolan.org). That’s why we’re encouraged
by Microsoft’s recent decision to release
the Web Media Extensions app in the
Windows Store (www.snipca.com/26403,
see screenshot below left). It adds support
for three new media formats (OGG, Vorbis
and Theora) to Windows 10. Hopefully,
this is a trend that Microsoft will continue
in 2018 and beyond, adding support for
more media formats via similar free apps.
16 Free maps
The recently updated
StreetComplete app (www.
snipca.com/26404) not only
provides access to all OpenStreetMap
(www.openstreetmap.org) maps on your
Android phone or tablet, but also lets
you add information yourself (see
screenshot right). By completing simple
‘quests’ you can ﬁll in incomplete or
unﬁnished data in your local area. The
latest version lets you attach photos and
comments. All you need is a free
OpenStreetMap account.

In the words of Director-General
Tony Hall, the BBC is on a
mission to “reinvent public
service broadcasting for a new
generation”. Part of that is to make more
shows available to watch online through
the iPlayer. We applaud the timing of its
ﬁrst big eﬀort – a bunch of classic shows
made available just in time for Yuletide
viewing. You can stream or download
them for free.
Visit the BBC’s site for the list of
programmes (www.snipca.com/26406),
which includes both series of Planet Earth
and Blue Planet; acclaimed dramas Peaky
Blinders, Wolf Hall and Line of Duty; and
the comedies Gavin and Stacey and
Miranda.
You can also watch series 3 and 4 of
Sherlock, every regeneration episode of
Doctor Who from 2005, and ﬁve
EastEnders Christmas specials (including
Den handing Angie divorce papers in
1986, watched by a mind-boggling 30
million people!).
The shows won’t be available for long
though – just until mid-January. Hopefully
this will free up space for more shows
throughout 2018. Classic series from the
1970s and 1980s would be our top choice.

Using Oﬃce 2007
When making their plans for 2017,
hackers would have ringed the date ‘10
October’ in their calendars. It’s when
Microsoft ended ‘Extended’ support for
Oﬃce 2007, meaning it’ll never receive
another security update. You can still use
it, but with every day that passes it
becomes less safe. It’s time to move on.
You have three realistic options:
upgrade to the latest version of Oﬃce;
switch to a non-Microsoft oﬃce suite like
LibreOﬃce (www.libreoﬃce.org); or
swap downloadable desktop programs
for online oﬃce tools.
Upgrading to the new version involves
a choice between Oﬃce 365 (subscription
only; £5.99 a month, or £60 a year) and
Oﬃce 2016 (a one-oﬀpayment of £120).
In contrast, switching to LibreOﬃce

Letting Windows 10 updates
ruin your day
Forget TVs, dishwashers and sandwich
toasters - the greatest invention of the
20th Century was the ‘snooze’ button on
alarm clocks. Microsoft added the option
(see screenshot below) to the Windows 10
Creators Update (released in April), letting
you postpone updates for up to three days.
You can also click ‘Pick a time’ to schedule
when you want an update installed.
It’s probably the most helpful thing
Microsoft did in 2017. No longer will huge
updates force themselves on your PC
unannounced. This option appears only
for Microsoft’s twice-yearly major updates
- in 2018 they are codenamed Redstone 4
(Version 1803, due March) and Redstone
5 (Version 1809, due in Autumn).

Using software to defrag
your computer
Piriform makes four essential programs.
Actually, make that three. While we
recommend Speccy, Recuva and CCleaner
(when it’s not smuggling Avast on to your
PC - see page 16), we’re less keen on
Defraggler. Such defragging tools were
once essential to keep your hard drive
healthy, but most modern PCs can do
the job themselves.
In Windows 10 it’s better to use the
Optimise Drives tool. Windows runs it on
a schedule, so you should never need to
open it manually. It’s best to leave it get
on with the job. The golden rule of
defragging is that it’s unnecessary on
SSDs. Worse, it can even damage the
drive. Windows 10 knows this, so
automatically turns oﬀOptimise Drives
when it detects you’ve installed an SSD.

Forgetting where you
parked your car
None of the world’s 10 largest car parks
are in the UK (they’re all in the US and
Canada, since you ask), but it can still be
infuriatingly tricky to locate your vehicle
in airports, theme parks and shopping
centres. It’s one of the problems Google
solved in 2017 with an update to its Maps
app in March.
Once you’ve parked, open Google Maps
on your phone, tap the blue dot that
indicates your location (and therefore
where your car is), then tap ‘Save your
parking’. When you’re ready to return to
your car, tap the ‘You parked here’ pin
(see screenshot below), then Directions.
You can make notes about where you
parked by tapping ‘Parking location’ at
the bottom, and set a timer so you return

THE £75M BITCOIN MISTAKE
Whatever mistakes you made this year,
be thankful none cost you £75m. That’s
the approximate value of 7,500 Bitcoins
stored on a hard drive that James
Howells, an IT worker from Newport,
threw away in 2013. At the time it was
worth a few hundred thousand pounds.
But as the price of the cryptocurrency
has rocketed (by over 1,000 per cent
this year), so has the value of his lost
hard drive. Howells says it’s buried in
a landﬁll site owned by Newport City
Council, and is seeking permission to
look for it. But he accepts that it’s a “big,
expensive and risky project”.
59
means a choice between nothing and
nada. Yes, it’s free, and is quickly becoming
a favourite with Computeractive readers
and writers alike (we’ll start including it
soon in our Make Oﬃce Better page).
These downloadable programs are ideal
for heavy oﬃce users. If your needs are
less advanced, try Microsoft’s free Oﬃce
Web Apps (www.snipca.com/25198) and
Google Drive (https://drive.google.com).
The latter is more versatile because it
works oﬄine. Microsoft is unlikely to
provide this because it still wants people
to cough up for the paid-for versions of
Oﬃce.
5
Using poor screen-recording
apps on iPhone and iPad
One of the best things about an update
to Windows, iOS and Android is they
come with new tools built into the system,
meaning you no longer need to use
shoddy apps made by other developers.
One of the most useful in 2017 was the
new screen-recording tool in iOS 11,
released at the end of September.
You ﬁrst need to add it to your Control
Centre by tapping Settings, Control
Centre, Customise Controls, then tapping
the green button next to Screen
Recording. Next, open the Control Center
by swiping up from the bottom of your
screen. You should see the red Screen
Recording button in the bottom-left
corner (see screenshot below). When you
tap this to start a recording, you’ll be
prompted to turn the microphone on or
oﬀ. Turn it on if you want to add a
commentary to your recording. Your
videos are saved on your Camera Roll, so
open the Photos app to watch and edit
them.
6
Letting old ﬁles clog up
your PC
With a new Paint 3D app, Microsoft
wanted the Creators Update to inspire the
inner artist in all of us. More useful
though was the ‘Storage sense’ tool,
which automatically deletes temporary
ﬁles that your programs aren’t using.
The Fall Creators Update, released in
October, added the option to delete ﬁles
in the Downloads folder that haven’t
changed in 30 days. ‘Storage sense’ is
turned oﬀby default. Activate it by
going to Settings, System, Storage, then

Hoping that ransomware
will go away
There are two strategies for dealing with
ransomware. One is what we call the
stick-your-ﬁngers-in-your-ears-and-
hope-it-goes-away method. It’s tempting,
but deeply ﬂawed. Another is to devise a
clever backup procedure to keep your
ﬁles safe. That’s the plan we prefer.
The key to surviving an attack is saving
your ﬁles to a hard drive that’s not
normally connected to your PC. Free
program Veeam Agent (www.snipca.
com/26464) does the job. It can back up
ﬁles on a schedule, but we recommend
choosing the option to back up when the
‘target’ is connected. This means it will
automatically back up ﬁles when you
attach your hard drive. Also tick the ‘Eject
removable storage once backup is
completed’ option. You should save
Veeam’s Recovery Media ﬁle to a USB
stick so you can access your ﬁles from it if
attacked by ransomware. Your ﬁles should
now be beyond the reach of hackers. Just
make sure you don’t ditch your hard drive
in a landﬁll site (see box above).

Emailing large ﬁles
One program that deserved greater
plaudits in 2017 was the free FileDirect
(www.oo-software.com/en/ﬁledirect)
from German software company O&O.
Released in May, it lets you send ﬁles of
any size without having to attach them to
an email. You need the program installed
on your PC, but the recipient doesn’t.
Instead you send them a downloadable
link by email which they open in their
browser (Chrome, Firefox and Opera; it
doesn’t work on Edge and iOS devices).
Also new this year was Firefox Send
(https://send.ﬁrefox.com), which sends
ﬁles up to 16GB (though Firefox
recommends no bigger than 1GB for
“reliable operation”). The email link
received by the recipient self-destructs
after 24 hours.

Check local crime rate
Containing data going back to October
2014, Police.uk maps (www.police.uk)
report crimes in your area. Zoom into
the map and click a number to see what
the crime was (anti-social behaviour,
burglary or shoplifting, for example),
then click the small ‘More details’ link
(see screenshot below) for more
information. To see whether the crime
was solved, click ‘Case timeline’ on the
next page. Click ‘Sign up for alerts’ in the
right-hand menu to receive monthly
bulletins about crime in your area.
Discover environmental data
Data about natural aspects of our
locality is easier to access than ever.
The Environment Agency’s website
(www.snipca.com/26351) provides
information that, 20 years ago, you’d have
needed your own weather station and
team of geographers to obtain. You can
ﬁnd out everything you need to know
about farming in your area, how local
coasts and shorelines are eroding, where
your nearest authorised landﬁll is, and
most importantly how much your home
is at risk of ﬂooding.
Also useful is the Noise Map from
environmental consultants Extrium
(www.snipca.com/26376), which
visualises noise pollution caused by road
and rail traﬃc. Purple is very noisy (75
decibels and over); orange represents the
quietest areas (under 59 decibels).
Give roadworks and accident
blackspots a wide berth
To avoid roadworks in your area visit
Roadworks.org (https://roadworks.org),
which uses information from local and
national highways authorities. Click a
symbol and you’ll see what’s taking place
and who’s responsible (Virgin Media in
our screenshot above - let’s hope they are
laying super-fast broadband!).
For details of potential disruptions,
check planning applications on your local
council’s website. One way to ﬁnd this is
via Gov.uk – go to www.snipca.
com/26342 and type your postcode.
CrashMap (www.crashmap.co.uk)
shows traﬃc incidents stretching back 19
years, using data collected by the police
and reported to the Department for
Transport. You can ﬁlter searches by
vehicle type and severity (slight, serious
or fatal), but to read more details you’ll
need to pay for a report (£1 each).
Measure your area’s
wealth and happiness
Whoever said you can’t measure
happiness obviously didn’t work for the
Oﬃce for National Statistics (ONS). Its
annual ‘Personal well-being’ survey
quantiﬁes the life satisfaction of people in
the UK of every area on the UK mainland.

of writing, this hadn’t yet been updated
with the latest results (www.snipca.
com/26344), published in November, in
which England was the only country to
see an improvement in life satisfaction.
The ONS has also measured wealth, on
its map of ‘Regional gross disposable
household income’: www.snipca.
com/26346.
Analyse 2011’s Census data
DataShine Census (http://datashine.org.
uk) is probably the most complex site
here, but also the most fascinating. It
maps every aspect of the 2011 Census in
England and Wales (for Scotland visit
www.snipca.com/26341), letting you dig
deep into the changing nature of our
country. That said, the postcode search
box is hard to spot - you’ll ﬁnd it at the
bottom. Type it, click Go, then zoom in.
Where it gets really interesting is in the
Data Chooser bar at the top right. Using
this you can ﬁlter the results by very
speciﬁc criteria, including religion,
health, ethnicity, employment and
languages spoken. You then need to
check the yellow-to-red bar at the
bottom left, showing low to high. For
example, in our screenshot above
displaying how many people in east
London were born in the UK, the redder
the area, the higher the percentage.
In the yellow areas, the proportion is
around 25 per cent and less.
To see where people are moving to
and from within the UK, visit the Royal
Mail’s Moving Map (www.snipca.
com/26349). Launched in early 2017, it
uses addresses given to its redirection
service to chart how far people move into
and out of an area (the average is 25.8
miles, with the longest being 728).
Find out the value of your
(and your neighbours’) home
It’s always interesting to check the value
of your home, then compare it with your
neighbours’. To do that, use the calculator
from mortgage advisors London &
Country (www.snipca.com/26357).
Next, browse the heat maps from
online estate agent Zoopla (www.zoopla.
co.uk/heatmaps), which show you
average prices by postcode, helpfully
colour-coded. Port Talbot’s £129,000 for
example shows as a cool, calming blue.
West London’s glamorous Fitzrovia, on
the other hand, is painted a shocking
shade of dark red, thanks to its £4.4m
price tag.
You can use the Land Registry, via
Gov.uk, to ﬁnd out how much a
particular property sold for (www.gov.
uk/search-house-prices), while
Nationwide’s House Price Index tool
(www.snipca.com/26352) calculates the
percentage rise in your home’s value.
Famous places
Forget about property values, here’s
something truly priceless: a spot in
silver-screen history. The UK Map of Film
Locations (www.snipca.com/26354) plots
82 of cinema’s most memorable
locations, some of which may be closer to
you than you think. Who knew Batman
lived in Nottingham? Wollaton Hall to be
precise.
The BFI’s Britain on Film site (www.
snipca.com/26355) may actually give you
a historical glimpse of your own home.
Thousands of clips from the past 120
years have been preserved and uploaded,
painting a unique picture of Britain
through the years.
See the Blitz bomb sites
From 7 September 1940 to 10 May 1941
London was subjected to unrelenting
bombing by the German Luftwaﬀe. Some
30,000 tonnes of bombs were dropped
during the Blitz, killing 40,000 people.
Using data previously only available at
the National Archives, Bomb Sight (www.
bombsight.org) maps where the bombs
fell, including one right next to where
Computeractive now resides (see
screenshot left).
WHAT YOUR AREA USED
TO LOOK LIKE
There are several sites that reveal how
your area has changed, over centuries,
decades and in the past 10 years.
Old Maps Online (www.oldmaps
online.org) goes the furthest back in
time, oﬀering 400,000 maps from
around the world – many from the 16th
and 17th Century. For vintage photos of
the UK, try the Francis Frith Collection
(www.francisfrith.com), which adds
new images every month. You can buy
framed prints, or turn them into jigsaws,
calendars, mugs and tea towels.
More dramatic are the photos on
the Britain from Above site (https://
britainfromabove.org.uk, pictured),
showing 95,000 aerial shots, including
the largest collection taken before
World War 2. It’s an
irresistible way to
spend a nostalgic
afternoon, even if
many of the factories,
stadiums, dockyards and cramped
streets are long gone.
Bringing us up to date is Google
Street View, which shows old and
new imagery side by side - though by
‘old’, Google means anything taken
since 2007 (when its cars started
photographing the world). This works
only in areas that have a clock icon in
the top-left box.

You didn’t say if you’re seeing
error messages, or what version
of Windows you have, but your
ﬁrst check should be in Device Manager.
To summon this, press Windows
key+R, then type devmgmt.msc into the
Run box and press Enter. Then, in Device
Manager, left-click to expand the
‘Imaging devices’ section, where you’ll
ﬁnd an entry for your webcam. If you see
a down arrow by its icon then it has, for
whatever reason, been disabled. To
re-enable it, right-click the device name,
then click ‘Enable device’ (see screenshot).
If this doesn’t work, or the webcam
wasn’t marked as disabled, then right-
click the device name again and this time
choose ‘Update driver’, followed by
‘Search automatically for updated driver
software’, and follow any prompts.
If this fails, then uninstalling the device
before restarting your PC will prompt
Windows to detect and set it up afresh,
which should ﬁx the problem. Right-click
the device, then choose ‘Uninstall device’
followed by Uninstall to conﬁrm. When
the process ﬁnishes, restart your PC.

I have an old iPhone 4
that was serving my
needs well until the
power button became
permanently stuck down! I’ve
tried everything to dislodge it
but it will not move, so I can
no longer switch oﬀmy
iPhone. The battery on this old
handset is fading, so I like to
switch it oﬀovernight to save
power – but obviously I can’t
do that now. Apple tells me it
no longer oﬀers service for this
phone. A local repair shop
quoted £90 to replace the
button, but that’s more than I
want to pay for this old thing.
Could I take this apart myself
to clean out any gunge? Or do
you have any other ideas?
Michael Grange
A
Repairing an iPhone 4
is not easy. Speciﬁcally,
the iFixit website – which is
an authority on these matters – rates
the task of replacing the iPhone 4’s
power button as ‘diﬃcult’. You’ll ﬁnd
iFixit’s detailed guide at www.snipca.
com/26155. If you do go down that
road you’ll need an appropriate
toolkit, as the iPhone is secured with a
variety of screws. These are cheaply
available from the likes of Amazon,
such as this £3.70 kit at www.snipca.
com/26154.
Once inside, if you’re lucky, a blast
from a can of compressed air or bit of
(very careful) gunge-scraping with a
ﬁne edge might get the button moving
again. But it’s just as likely that the
mechanism itself is broken. If that’s the
case, then the replacement part costs
around £3.50 (www.snipca.
com/26156). But remember that iFixit’s
rating is that this is an intricate and
delicate job.
If you decide this repair is beyond
you, the accessibility features built into
iOS can help – a bit. From the home

screen tap Settings followed by General
and then Accessibility. Now swipe to
the Physical & Motor section and tap
AssistiveTouch, then ﬂip the
AssistiveTouch switch to On.
A ‘ﬂoating’ button will appear on
screen, which you can reposition just
by dragging and dropping. Tapping this
button opens a box that provides
touchscreen control over your iPhone’s
physical buttons. Tap Device, for
example, and you’ll see a padlock icon
labelled Lock Screen (see screenshot):
this is the touchscreen version of the
Power button. If you tap and hold this
for a few moments, the lock screen will
appear, just as it would if you held
down the physical button. Then, to
switch oﬀ, just move the ‘slide to power
oﬀ’ slider all the way to the right.
However, you’ll have a problem when
you next need to switch it on, as the
physical power button remains broken.
There’s no perfect solution to this, but
plugging in to charge or sync will bring
your iPhone 4 back to life.

Q
I’ve been using PCs reasonably
proﬁciently for a few years now,
recently buying a new Windows
10 laptop to complement my Windows 7
desktop workhorse. While making an
eﬀort to learn the new operating system
I noticed that the search bar in Windows
Explorer remembers my previous
searches, much like Chrome does (that’s
my preferred web browser). I’d never
noticed this in Windows 7 but, sure
enough, when I ﬁred up Windows
Explorer on my desktop and started
typing in the search bar, I was presented
with suggestions that I recognised as old
searches. I don’t think there’s anything
embarrassing in there but, as I share both
my PCs with my partner, I’d like to erase
or at least manage this history — but I
have no idea how. Could you explain?
John Waters
A
First up, we should point out
that Microsoft renamed
Windows Explorer in Windows
10, where it’s now known as File
Explorer. Despite a visual overhaul it is
more or less the same tool as before.
However, on this one particular point the
methods to achieve what
you want are diﬀerent — so
we’ll explain each one.
File Explorer makes it
very easy to clear the search
history, though you do need
to know where to look.
First, click in the search bar as usual.
Then, in the Options category of the
ribbon’s Search tab, click ‘Recent
searches’ followed by ‘Clear search
history’ (see screenshot above).
Windows Explorer doesn’t have this
option. In fact, the only way to erase the
search history in the Windows 7 version
of the tool is to edit the Windows registry.
As ever when making changes to the
registry, we’d strongly advise backing up

Explorer searches?
have System Restore enabled
(as is both sensible and the
default). This is normal
and quite safe, and
Windows knows what
it’s doing.
The background to all this is that,
unlike traditional hard drives, an SSD
uses memory chips for storage — and
these are certiﬁed only for a limited
number of read/write cycles. However,
that number is enormous and reaching it
would take very many years of normal
use. Even then, the chip in question
won’t automatically instantly die: it’s just
a possibility.
Defragging involves lots of read/write
cycles. As the process doesn’t speed up
SSDs, it’s basically pointless. File-
shredding is similarly ﬁne, if you feel
the need, but disable any multiple-pass
options: they’re unnecessary on an
SSD. Files deleted from hard drives can
leave magnetic ‘residues’ that, in
theory, could allow someone to
resurrect the ﬁle.

not need to

If I use Internet Explorer 11
(IE11) and put my postcode into

A
Clearing internet history won’t
wipe information entered into
website forms — that’s part of
IE11’s AutoComplete feature. You can
either disable this feature or periodically
wipe the information it collects.
In IE11, click the Settings cog
followed by ‘Internet options’ and then
Content. Now, in the AutoComplete
section, click Settings. To disable the
feature, clear all the ticks. To delete the
history, click ‘Delete AutoComplete

Q
I installed my old Oﬃce
2000 CD on my new
Windows 10 laptop, as it’s
all I need. It worked at ﬁrst but for
some reason the ﬁles are no longer
associated with the Oﬃce programs,
even though Word and Excel and so
on still work. Control Panel doesn’t
list these old apps as options for
launching the relevant ﬁle types. Is
this a fault caused by a Windows 10
update?
Alan Dexter
A
While it’s possible that some
Windows 10 update
removed Oﬃce 2000’s ﬁle
associations, it would be unfair to
label this a fault: the suite is 18 years
old (it was released in June 1999)and
Microsoft ceased support for it in
2009. The company doesn’t claim
Oﬃce 2000 is compatible with
Windows 10, and doesn’t expect
people to still be using it.
Remaking these associations is
not obvious in Windows 10. From
Control Panel, click Programs
followed by ‘Make a ﬁle type always
open in a speciﬁc program’ (under
Default Programs). Select a ﬁle type
(‘.doc for Word,’ say), then click the
‘Change program’ button followed by
the ‘More apps’ link. Now scroll to
the bottom of the list and click ‘Look
for another app on this PC’, and then
navigate to ﬁnd and select Word’s
executable ﬁle (in C:\Program Files\
Microsoft Oﬃce\Oﬃce9, for
example).

charges companies like Google a hefty
fee. Google could enable payments in its

to do so for this reason.
However, the YouTube app will play
movies that you buy elsewhere online
using the same Google account. So, log
into YouTube on a web browser and make
a purchase there. You don’t have a PC but
you can do this in any web browser,
including Safari on your iPad. When you
return to the YouTube app you’ll ﬁnd
your movie by tapping Library followed

Google has just changed the

then scroll down to the bottom and click
‘PDF documents’ (see screenshot 1).
Switch oﬀthe slider on the next page
(see screenshot 2).
Close the settings and you should ﬁnd
that Chrome’s default behaviour has
reverted to displaying PDFs online. Click
the download icon at the top right to save
a copy of any PDF.

Yes, there’s an easy shortcut
to do this. Create the two
browser windows but don’t
bother resizing or repositioning
them. Hold down the Shift key and
right-click the browser’s icon on the
taskbar. You should see the option to
‘Show windows side by side’.
Selecting this does what you require,
although there will be a slightly
annoying gap between the windows.

The Startup folder is not directly related
to the Start menu. Programs or program
shortcuts that live in the Startup folder
will launch with Windows when your
computer starts up. So, for example, if
you put a shortcut to Microsoft Edge in
the Startup folder, then that web browser
would launch as soon as Windows itself
has started up (hence the folder’s name).
Up to Windows 7, the Startup folder
appeared in and was accessible from the
Start menu. Windows 8/8.1 obviously has
no Start menu, so the Startup folder
wasn’t accessible that way. For reasons
unknown, this remains true with
Windows 10, where there’s no entry for
the Startup folder in the Start menu.
The Startup folder still exists in both
Windows 8/8.1 and 10, but access is more
convoluted. One option is to press
Windows key+E to launch File Explorer
and then navigate to C:\Users\
[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\
Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\
Programs\Startup. Alternatively, press
Windows key+R, type shell:common
startup and press Enter.
You’ll probably ﬁnd shortcuts in the
Startup folder. Deleting existing ones
will stop the related tools launching
with Windows; dragging shortcuts into
this folder does the opposite.

so forgive me if my question
seems naive — but could you
explain the diﬀerence between Start
and Startup? I understand that clicking
the Start button at the bottom left
opens a menu. However, I’ve seen
advice (including in Computeractive)
to put things in the Startup folder.
When you say that do you mean the
icons that appear in the menu after I’ve
clicked Start? I’m confused, so I hope
you can explain! I use Windows 10.
Fran Fowler
A
Let’s start with the basics:
clicking the Start button opens
the Start menu. This Start
menu has existed since Windows 95,
although Microsoft famously removed
it from Windows 8/8.1 — replacing it
with a much-maligned full-screen
version, sometimes called the Start
screen. The Start menu returned in

Are my Office and OneNote files going to be useless?
The content, though, will always remain
intact. The Oﬃce ﬁles saved to your USB
memory sticks are just the same as those
on your hard drive, so you’ll be able to
open them with LibreOﬃce at any point
in the future.
Unfortunately, LibreOﬃce doesn’t
currently have an equivalent program for
OneNote, so if you’re ditching Microsoft’s
program you’ll need an alternative.
Evernote (www.evernote.com) is a
popular choice. It can import ﬁles from
OneNote: just open the File menu, then
choose Import followed by OneNote, and
then follow the prompts (see screenshot).
Q
As Microsoft has
stopped supporting
Oﬃce 2007,
I downloaded your
recommended replacement,
LibreOﬃce. I have saved
my Excel home accounts
using LibreOﬃce’s ‘ODF
Spreadsheet (.ods) (*.ods)’
option. Similarly, I have
saved my Microsoft Word
documents using
LibreOﬃce’s ‘ODF Text
Document (.odt) (*.odt)’
option. Have I done the
right thing here? I also
have a lot of old correspondence
saved on USB memory sticks. I
want to keep these, but if I delete
Microsoft Oﬃce I assume these will
no longer be accessible? If so, is there
a quick way of converting these ﬁles
en bloc? Finally, I have also used
OneNote 2007. How do I convert the
information from that for use in
LibreOﬃce?
Alan Hughes-Jones
A
If you plan to stick with
LibreOﬃce for the long term
then yes, saving your ﬁles using
the program’s ‘native’ format makes
sense. We say this because, although
LibreOﬃce is able to open Microsoft
Oﬃce ﬁles (and vice versa), there will be
occasions when small aspects of a
document won’t make the journey
entirely unchanged — whether that be the
page layout, formatting or other details.
The Startup folder is accessible from the
Start menu (above)

Why can’t I use GodMode after
Fall Creators Update?
Q
Issue 492’s Cover Feature was about
GodMode, a hidden Windows tool
which has dozens of links to Control
Panel features. I’ve found it very handy,
but after the Fall Creators Update (FCU)
it no longer works. You predicted
this might happen due to Microsoft’s
approach to Control Panel. Can you
conﬁrm if GodMode has now gone, or is
there an alternative setup code for the
latest update?
Vic Jackson
A
It’s possible that FCU removed an
existing GodMode icon from your
Windows desktop. However, we’ve tested
GodMode with FCU and it still works
just ﬁne — but its icon no longer displays
the ‘GodMode’ label. If FCU has removed
your GodMode icon then it can be re-
created as before.
First, right-click a blank area of your
desktop, then choose New followed by
‘folder’. Name this folder ‘GodMode.
{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-
99712043E01C}’ and press Enter. To avoid
errors, you can visit the Pastebin page we
created at www.snipca.com/26328 and
copy and paste the full code from there.
Can I print labels in LibreOﬃce?
Q
Thank you for the useful ‘Print
postage labels for free’ Workshop in
Issue 515 (page 38). It obviously works
well with Microsoft Word, but I would
love to print Avery labels L7160 using
LibreOﬃce Writer. Is this possible?
Dave Willington
A
Yes it is, and you’re not the only
reader to have enquired about this
(see Don Palmer’s lead tip in Readers’
Tips, page 43). This is clearly a popular
option so it’s worth repeating.
First, open the File menu, hover your
cursor over New, then click Labels.
Next, in the Labels box that appears,
click ‘Avery A4’ in the Brand dropdown
menu and ‘L7160 Address’ in the Type
dropdown menu (see screenshot below
left). Finally, click the New Document
button to create a new, blank document
with the template you need for L7160
labels.
How do I remove all my
Google data?
Q
In Issue 515, your Cover Feature on
what Google, Facebook and Amazon
know about us gives instructions on how
to remove the data Google has collected
on you (see page 51). However, it seems
you can only delete one day at the time.
Do you know if it’s possible to wipe all
the data in one fell swoop? I’ve spent ages
removing around months’ worth of data,
so this would be a great help.
Claude Legrand
A
We did provide instructions on this.
The relevant section directly followed
the advice on removing items one day at
a time (it spilled into the next column,
so you may have overlooked it). To recap,
ﬁrst click the menu button (three stacked
dots) at the top right and then choose
‘Delete activity by’ (see screenshot above
left). Now choose ‘All time’ and ‘All
products’ in the dropdown menus, click
Delete, then Delete again to conﬁrm.
Which system processes can I
close in Windows?
Q
I downloaded IObit Advanced
SystemCare as per the Workshop
in Issue 515 (page 35). Step 10 explains
how to close background processes. I
understand these can slow down a PC,
but I have diﬃculty deciding which
processes can be closed and which
should be left open. Can you advise?
Frank Hodder
A
We must admit to a small mistake
in this Workshop – the rocket icon
actually ‘cleans’ your PC’s memory,
rather than closing all background
processes. You can still do this by ticking
all the boxes then clicking End Task, but
that’s not a good idea unless you really
know what you’re doing. The best answer
to a tricky question is to close only those
entries you recognise and know won’t
cause problems. Select SystemCare’s
SpeedUp tab, then click Conﬁgure. Items
under the System Services tab are best left
alone while those under Non-Windows
Services and Background Apps (see
screenshot above) may be safe to close,
but search on Google to research these.

ack when I had luxuries such as a
generous amount of hair on my
head, and the occasional follicle
that wasn’t permanently grey, I could
look at an old class photo from my
school days (a colour photograph, and we
were allowed to wear long trousers) and
still name around 90 per cent of the
people in it.
As hair tumbled out and wrinkles
appeared, that number dropped each
time I looked at it. I reckon now, on a
good day, I can get identify 50 per cent.
I naturally did the only logical thing, and
promptly binned the photo.
These changing abilities and capacities
of our brain is a natural by-product of
age. We gather so much information
in it that it’s easy to lose things. Can
computers help?
Brain-training software has been
popular since Nintendo hit paydirt with
the hugely popular 2006 game Dr
Kawashima’s Brain Training (see
screenshot below). It sold several million
copies on the Nintendo DS, and spawned
a host of imitators. Since then a multi-
million pound industry has grown around
claims that games don’t just exercise the
grey matter, but can also delay the onset
of dementia. And yet some of the
evidence is patchy to say the least.
In this new column I’ll be putting the
games, sites and apps that make these
claims to the test, assessing whether they
are no more than just a bit of fun (not
that there’s anything wrong with that).
The Alzheimer’s Society website was a
good place to start. Its research with
King’s College London concluded that
brain-training games have a positive
impact. One game tested by volunteers
was the SeeSaw Challenge (www.snipca.
com/26428, see screenshot above right),
which asks you to click whichever object
you think is heaviest.
I’m not convinced it taught me
anything though. After beating the game
it tried to enrol in a study. This entire
process took about 50 seconds. I opted to
move on, but it’s still worth visiting the
page to read some of the more detailed
science behind the research.
As a beginner to brain training, I went
hunting for something to measure what
my abilities are like now. Which is when
I stumbled on Brain Reﬂection (www.
brainmetrix.com/brain-reﬂection) on
the educational website Brain Metrix.
Like a lot of these exercises, it appears
quite basic at ﬁrst glance, but has you
hammering your keyboard and mouse
to death by the end.
Brain Reﬂection, according to the
pompous blurb on the website,
“invariably leads to inquiry into the
human condition and the essence of
humankind as a whole”. This time, I
needed to hit start, look at a white box,
then hit stop when the colour changed.
Do this in under 0.2 seconds and my
reaction would be ‘super fast’. I’m not
sure I ever want to be described as ‘super’
anything, but I gave it a go.
Turn one: 0.359 seconds
Turn two: 0.337 seconds
Turn 10: 0.349 seconds
Turn 15: 0.371 seconds

Turn 20: I reset my router, because
clearly the speed of my web connection
was counting against me
Turn 100: 0.414 seconds
Turn 120: 0.503. In what was becoming
a metaphor for my life, I began to appreciate
that I’d peaked too soon.
My brain, its reaction, and my chances
of being ‘super-fast’ at anything useful
clearly need work. My journey down this
particular rabbit hole will begin in
earnest next issue. I’m fearful already.
