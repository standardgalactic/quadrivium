Using Two Hypnotic Cards 
 
 
So I’m going to use two cards ‘You really should discover for yourself that _____’ and ‘I 
need to tell you ______’ 
 
So, I need to tell you that you can relax and you really should discover for yourself 
that relaxation can lead to comfort. 
 
It’s the same thing we did a moment ago, we’re just going to roll on, shall we say, with 
two cards to get more the feel for it. 
 
So, I want you to suppose that you’re comfortable and what would it be like if you 
were relaxed. 
 
And you can experience comfort as if it were a blanket, just pretend you’re 
covered in that blanket. 
 
Wonderful. Notice how it starts stimulating your mind, your creative unconscious, shall 
we say, to find some logical connections between these ideas. The trick here is, don’t try 
too hard. If you try and make sense, you’ll stymie yourself and go uh, uh, ooh, uh.  
 
So the next thing I’m going to encourage you to do is turn the cards over so you don’t 
actually see what’s on the cards before they come, so then it becomes as surprise to 
you.
