The implementation of a campus information management
system design in a vocational school
Bin Han & Xiaobin Bi
Tianjin Bohai Vocational Technology College, TianJin, China
ABSTRACT:
Campus information management is the foundation of education informatization construc-
tion. So the Internet construction of campus information management systems has become an important
part of school information construction based on so much attention. In order to achieve the school of
information sharing, enhance the links between parents and schools, improve the efficiency of the manage-
ment of schools at an educational level, according to the requirements of campus information management,
VisualStudio2005 +ASP.NET2.0, as the design platform, puts forward the overall design scheme of the system,
the analysis and implementation process of the system’s detailed design, and the key techniques to realize the
system are researched in the system.
1
THE BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
OF RESEARCH WORK
With the rapid development of Internet, the Internet
has become an important channel for people to obtain,
release, and transfer information. It plays an important
role in many people’s work, life, study, etc. Publishing
information on the Internet is mainly achieved through
websites, and access to information is the Internet ‘sea’
in a certain way to retrieve the information needed to
browse. So the Internet construction of a campus infor-
mation management system has become an important
part of school information construction. In order to
achieve a school of information sharing, enhancing
the links between parents and the schools, improv-
ing school management efficiency and the managerial
level, a special construction of a campus information
management system for national vocational schools is
needed.

NET TECHNOLOGY
The NET is a new generation of Web application
development platforms of Microsoft. The NET frame-
work is a multi language environment set up, config-
ured, and run by Web services and applications, NET
components and applications, and provides the best
development environment for writing ASP.NET2.0
applications.
The Web service is the basic building block of
distributed applications based on the network. The
distributed application platform is independent and is
usually created using the object template and a vari-
ety of languages. A Web service based on HTTP and
XML, open Internet standards, and the formation in
Microsoft of a programmable network theory.TheWeb
service can receive a request and XML data by HTTP.
The Web service is not specific to a certain component
and object calling conventions, so it can be accessed in
any language, or operating system component model.
The Web service is an application, it can use the stan-
dard internet protocol to embody the function of being
online in the Internet and also an internal enterprise.
The Web service has a Web component programming.
The quality of a good selection of development tools
and the speed of the system’s development and the
system’s future maintenance and upgrading is very
important. Based on the current system development
tools on the Internet, such as ASP, JSP, and NET,
according to the system characteristics and the prac-
tical development, finally I chose ASP.NET as the
system development tool, version 2.
Select theASP.NET 2 as a development tool, mainly
based on the previous version adds new features a
convenient, practical. Mainly in the following areas:
2.1
An increase of more than new server controls
According to the control’s characteristics, they can be
divided into: data control, login control, Web control,
site navigation control, and other controls.
2.2
The ASP.NET page only need one after the
compiler does not need to be recompiled
The ASP.NET page only need one after the compiler
and does not need to be recompiled, until the page has
been modified or the Web application is restarted and
the multiple access speed has been greatly improved.

2.3
GridView
GridView, DataDroplist and other database compo-
nent ASP.NET 2.o provided by ADO.NET can have
a direct database connection.
2.4
Code behind
ASP.NET 2 ‘code behind’ is a way to write the code
making the code easier to write, the structure clearer,
reducing the complexity and cost of the system’s
development and maintenance.

SQL RELATIONAL DATABASE
This system uses SQL Server2000. It has the following
characteristics:
3.1
Internet integration
To provide a complete XML support for the SQL
Server2000 database engine. It also has the scala-
bility, availability, and security features required for
data storage components, constituting the largest web
site. The SQL Server2000 programming model and
Windows DNA framework integration, developed web
applications, and SQL Server2000 English Query and
Microsoft search service and other functions, in the
Web application contains a user-friendly query and
powerful search function.
3.2
Scalability and availability
The same database engine can be used in different plat-
forms, from the portable computer running Microsoft
Windows 98, to large multi processor servers run-
ningMicrosoftWindows2000,datacentreedition.The
SQL Serve 2000 Enterprise Edition supports the Fed-
eration server, with indexed views and large memory
support and other functions, so that it can be upgraded
totheleveloftheperformancerequiredforamaximum
Web site.
3.3
Enterprise class database function
The SQL Server 2000 database engine supports
the demanding data processing environment required
function. The database engine fully protects data
integrity, and the management of thousands of concur-
rent databases and keeps user overheads to a minimum.
For any query, it allows you to reference data from dif-
ferent data sources in SQL Serve 2000 distributed, as
if these data are part of the SQL Server 2000 database,
and the distributed transaction supports the integrity
and the full protection of any distributed data updat-
ing. Replication also allows you to maintain multiple
copies of information, at the same time it ensures syn-
chronous replica alone. It can copy a set of data to
multiple mobile offline users, allow the user indepen-
dent operation, and then merge the changes back to the
server.
3.4
Easy to install, deploy and use
SQL Server 2000 includes a series of management and
development tools, these tools can improve process at
multiple sites on the installation, deployment, manage-
ment and use of SQL Server 2000. SQL Server 2000
also supports programming model standards and inte-
gration with Windows, based on DNA, using a SQL
Server database and a data warehouse, it becomes a
seamless part of a generated scalable powerful sys-
tem. These features enable you to quickly deliver a
SQL Server application, while the client only needs
to install it and the management overhead can at least
achieve these applications.
3.5
Data warehouse
SQL Server 2000 includes extraction and summary
data analysis and On Line Analytical Processing
(OLAP) tools. Some tools include a SQL Server and
can be used to visually design databases and analyse
data by English Query.
4
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The system uses the B/S architecture design. The Web
application is an application distributed by the server,
theWeb server and the client browser to cooperate with
each other to complete the function, so the structure
is also known as B/S (Browser/Server) structure. With
the traditional C/S (Client/Server), the structure is dif-
ferent, most of the functions in the B/S structure are
implemented on the server. According to the user’s
browser server sends request,.Therefore, control of the
client interface is all Web applications must realize
the function. In addition, Web applications generally
use the database, so the function module and database
interaction are necessary for the application.
According to the characteristics of Web application
andASP.NET technology, the system uses a three layer
of Web application development and design model,
based on ASP.NET technology. This model is the Web
application and is divided into three basic levels: user
interface layer, business logic layer, and data access
layer.
4.1
Software architecture
4.1.1
The page data display technology
4.1.1.1
Based on the data source control data
processing technology
In order to solve the problem of data processing of
the ASP.NET1.x version, ASP.NET 2 with a number
of improvements. To improve the data access model,
the improvement of ADO technology, one of the most
attractive is the introduction of a variety of data source
controls. The original code to achieve the function of
data processing is encapsulated in the data source con-
trol, and the specific data to these controls to call.
Such as the use of select, update, insert and delete
4

and other methods to achieve the database query,
update, insert and delete records operation record.
ASP.NET 2 also supports data bound controls which
are many, such as: DropDownlist, RadioButtonlist,
CheckBoxlist, ListBox, and GridView server controls.
4.2
The database design
A reasonable design of the database structure can
improve the efficiency of data storage, to ensure the
integrity and consistency of data. After fully under-
standing the functional requirements of the system,
the general system of the database, according to the
module, consists of an Information Management Sys-
tem Data Base (IMSDB), a student database (Student
DB) and a message database (Guest Book DB).
4.3
The design of system function module
The main task of this system is to realize the automa-
tion of teaching management in the school, parent
school contact information, and the campus informa-
tion management system is an important guarantee of
educational information. The main goal of the system
is the realization of:
Campus news publishing and the introduction into
the school of;
The informatization of teaching management and
resource sharing;
Parents and students to achieve a good interaction;
Student achievement query and daily behaviour.
According to the target of the system, taking into
account the different functions, module independence
is strong, the characteristics of data set, system ver-
satility, reliability, openness, from the function of the
system is divided into seven modules.
4.3.1
The campus news management module
The campus information management module mainly
includes news and the news to be added, modified,
deleted, and other basic management.
4.3.2
Student management module
Student management module includes student, class
information query and student, class information man-
agement, the students, the class information manage-
ment to the school class, the student information to

5
THE SYSTEM HAS REALIZED THE
FUNCTION
With the development of the Internet, each link of
educational activities will be gradually replaced by
informatization.The school affairs information should
be preferred as the first step in educational informati-
zation. This process greatly improves the efficiency of
school educational activities, deepens the interaction
and relationship between the school, the students, and
the parents, so as to improve the school’s running level.
The work in this paper is based on the Inter-
net, according to information technology education,
research and the design of a campus information
management system and an implementation method.
The purpose of the effective management of campus
information is to improve the level of running a school.
According to the campus information management
system design requirements, the system has realized
the following function:
1. School news release, additions, modifications,
deletions.
2. The student information, class information query,
add, modify, delete.
3. Students submit online timely, and then teachers,
parents can understand the situation of students.
4. Parents, students, teachers, interactive message
communication.
5. Online voting behaviour.
6. The examinee can enter online the examination
number and name, and the results are online.
7. The professional skills of students are submitted

A study in the design and production of TV titles techniques
in modern digital media
Qi Liu & Xiao Wang
Tianjin Bohai Vocational Technology College, TianJin, China
ABSTRACT:
Dramaisaprofessionalcommunicationartstechnology,cultureandartinone,andisanimportant
part of a television program packaging and image design. With the wide application of digital media technology
in the field of television production, planning, creative, design TV titles get tangible reproducing, TV also works
greatly to meet the aesthetic needs of the masses of the people. In this paper, from the general rules of TV titles
design creation, the themes of creative drama creation, colour, and music are explored, with several problems of
digital media technology and other elements of harmony and unity.
1
EFFECT OF TV TITLES IN THE TV
With the development of the media industry, the chan-
nel has already become the basic forms of existence
of TV. Because of television media’s demand for rat-
ings and the advertising market, TV and TV channel
images are being targeted with more and more atten-
tion and this gradually becomes a new profession. How
to construct the television and television channel brand
image, enhance the brand value, brand utility achieved
by TV media’s interest, has become an important task,
for each big television station. So, major television
stations have to pay attention to image management,
andhave introduced the conceptoftelevisionpublicity,
and at the same time more pay attention to the overall
channel packaging, in addition to television TV titles.
The channel film advertisement interval has been used
as an essential element in a day full of communication
broadcast television in the process. It also appeared in
the new topic of TV title design.

TECHNICAL INDICATORS SHOULD PAY
ATTENTION TO THE TV TITLE CREATION
Drama is an important part of program content and it
plays an effective interpretation of the program image,
packaging, and positioning of the role. TV titles, like
the title of an article, are summarized and hint at
the program’s content. This generalization and prompt
strictly within a certain period of time, at the same
time, these are used the methods of TV image to con-
ceive and design. This approach makes the audience’s
understanding, identify left the impression, and also
allows the audience to accept the entire program.
According to the State Administration of radio,
TV program technical quality awards (Jin Fanjiang),
“recording technique quality assessment approach”
of “video graphic evaluation method” requirement,
generally speaking, drama produced by its success or
failure, should, from the following technical indica-
tors, be measured.
2.1
On the theme creative evaluation
The drama theme is clear, the originality is novel, and
the form is clever.
2.2
The evaluation of production skills
TV title composition and modelling is pretty standard,
colours and materials use is reasonable, with exquisite
light, clip is consistent, with smooth motion rhythm;
technology is abundant, and can accurately express the
creative intention.
2.3
The overall effect on the overall visual effect
evaluation
The drama is prominent and sublimates the program
theme; the special nature and the style of TV music
whether it reflects the program picture and music,
coordinates, and has strong appeal.
The above elements, through the technical means of
production, accurately expressTV’s creative intention,
and is the key to evaluating the success of the drama’s
production.
3
DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF TV TITLES
3.1
The theme and the creation of TV titles
3.1.1
The theme of the drama
Drama is the theme of the central idea of drama per-
formance, reflected in the program orientation and
program style. A good TV title must make clear its
theme with prominent, rich and deep meaning, posi-
tive, to withstand the test of practice, to show the spirit
of the times, but also can be understood and accepted
by the audience.
7

3.1.2
The creative drama
TV titles of creativity use very simple TV language,
vivid, with an orderly combination by means of tech-
nology, creating a specific mood, so that the viewer
recognizes and resonates with its impressive con-
notation. Originality, as the whole drama packaging
activities of the soul and life, is the core of the whole
packaging program, only to create novel, unique per-
spective, the one and only, let a person gifted with an
extraordinary retentive memory, can talent showing
itself in numerous television channel brand program,
to be recognized by the audience.
3.1.3
The relationship between creative theme and
TV titles
If creativity is from the soul, then, the theme is from
the brain, and the two complement each other, theme
determinescreativity;creativitythetheme.Dramaidea
istoexpressthethemeinanaudio-visuallanguagepro-
gram used to visualize the process to create, through
technical means, a television special language form,
so that the viewer has recognition and resonance from
its connotation, which impresses. Program Program
positioning accuracy is the premise of creativity, and
grasping the drama theme is the foundation for accu-
rately positioning. Originality, as the whole drama
packaging activity of the soul and life, is the core of
TV titles. To show itself in numerous TV titles, for the
audience to memory, just do the new in order to be
different, unique perspective, out of the ordinary, and
the photographic memory.
Different types of programs with different require-
ments of content and form, which formed the individ-
ual characteristics of different program titles, is a typi-
cal representation of the characteristics of personality.
Therefore, the design thought of drama creation can-
not do without the personalized, personalized design
ideas to the subject; and full of individual creativity
through advanced technology, to shock the audience,
the purpose of emergent themes. For example, “law
and economics” and “today” and other TV titles are
the reality of material processing technology for the
performance of the theme, is a true form for the audi-
ence watching. CCTV’s publicity film is a kind of
freehand brushwork form. It is used in ink digital art
forms to express, through several abstract expression
highlighted titles on the theme ‘believe in the power of
the brand’, the title character is outstanding, the con-
notation is rich, so there was a kind of ‘find everything
fresh and new’ feeling.
3.2
Using the TV title creation colour technology
Television is a visual art, first without light and colour.
In the artistic creation of TV titles, how to make the
colour technology and colour art together to create
the fascinating TV titles is very worthy of our consid-
eration. Colour plays a rendering of the atmosphere,
deepens the theme, emotion is an expression of the
theme and is an important factor on the TV screen.
The TV title manufacture person has to experience the
colour to express the importance of artistic creation,
and the colour also has a very strong design sense.
If the particularity in order to emphasize the picture
colour sense from the application of colour inTV titles,
this colour design is a failure.
3.2.1
Colour reflecting the visual effect
Elements of TV pictures are dynamic, television titles
in colour are moving, and the titles show more visual
effects that comprehensively reflect a dynamic art.
Therefore, only reflect the program content specific
colour, in order to better reflect the visual effect.
3.2.2
The colour of a psychological impact
According to people’s visual habits, blues have con-
tractive feeling on the vision. Therefore, in television
program packaging blue is the most used colour, blue
is also known as the eternal colour, bright, blue, free
and other various feelings can be expressed. TV news
titles, mostly use blue colours, combined with the 3D
effect of light and a strong sense of space, to reflect
the news program clear, timeliness, modernity and the
atmosphere.
3.2.3
Application of gradient colour
With a lively sense of colour, feature rich layers.
Rational use of gradient colour, can make the pic-
ture more variability with TV titles and fluidity. As
a CCTV news titles are made of blue colours, blue
with a calm, objective, atmosphere, dignified temper-
ament. Its flagship program “news broadcast”, “news
30”, “evening news”, “focus interview” and other
programs,packagingcolourtheirtitlesreflectsthepro-
gram style, reflecting the CCTV news channel in the
matter.
3.2.4
Colour and a sense of rhythm
In the first use of colour, the same or a similar
colour, on the screen more than two reproductions
can create the most basic visual rhythm. For example:
colour image duplication, alternate, gradual change,
mutation, rhythmic colour, if the formation of linear
relationships between specific objects on the picture,
can give a person to feel full of vigour colour themes.
Thefilmtitlemanufactureofcleveruseofcolourpoint,
line, surface and their spacing, transfer, change and
other technical means, can produce the vitality of a
colour rhythm.
Therefore, as a drama producer, should consider the
special nature of colour art, according to the program
orientation and style characteristics, reasonable use
of colour, the colour is more compact, orderly, orga-
nized, so that television titles give more visual impact,
and more imaginative and expressive force in creating
more excellent works of art.
3.3
The design concept of TV music
TV music has special characteristics, it because the
program orientation and program style is different.
Generally speaking, television news music should
8

adhere to the objective, the atmosphere, solemn, clear,
strong sense of rhythm design concept; children’s
program of music is relaxed, lively, lively rhythm char-
acteristics; while the other TV themes according to
the characteristics of this program. But no matter what
kind of program music must have a common charac-
teristic: that is music must be closely combined with
the screen, a painting of harmony and unity, so that
the visual image and listening constitute an indivisible
whole, with enhanced visual effects.
Significantly different, as everyone knows, the
CCTV “news broadcast” and “weather forecast” will
be in the music style. In ‘News broadcast’ the music
gives people a solemn atmosphere, the feeling, and the
music has been experienced for more than ten years,
bears the national news music image, and expresses
the in-depth audience’s bone marrow. The ‘weather
forecast’ is to give a person a kind of relaxed, lively
feeling of the music. The positioning or feature visible
TV program determines the choice of music, music
must be closely combined with the screen, to create
visual harmony.
3.4
Application of TV film title manufacture
technology
Drama creation regardless of its form as realistic or
freehand, creative ideas and thoughts, will eventu-
ally need to be realized by digital media technology.
Withthewideapplicationofinformationnetworktech-
nology, digital compression technology in the field
of television, television program manufacture tech-
nology has undergone revolutionary changes. From
the computer caption machine being widely used to
the birth and the introduction of a non-linear edit-
ing system of 3D animation technology, it brought
a technological leap to television titles in artistic
creation.
3.4.1
Application of computer subtitles
In the late 1980s, with computer graphics technology
combined with the television signal processing subtitle
editing method, can from the computer up to dozens,
even hundreds of fonts in the select program character
font, text design, and can collect an appropriate pic-
ture, from computer rich art gallery in the pattern and
active material, as the ornament design background,
provides a broad space for the drama creation.
3.4.2
The application of 3D animation
The 3D animation is the combination of computer and
high technology and art, it makes use of graphics and
the principle of computer aided design into painting,
photography and other art categories with professional
skill, from the computer to create a three-dimensional
sense of space of the virtual objects and scenes. This
application realize the creation effect which cannot
be achieved by the traditional complex method, and
enhances the artistic appeal for the TV title creation.
3.4.3
The application of a nonlinear editing system
A nonlinear editing system is a computer operated
platform television post production system, is a set
of images, sounds, graphics, subtitles, working in an
environment, making the system can easily to realize
the whole function of the traditional complex sys-
tem, which brought great convenience for the drama
creation. As in conventional picture editing, tricks,
superposition and transformation of multi screens
multichannel 2D, 3D captions stunt effects, chroma
key, high quality audio editing and synthesis, com-
bined with the technology of computer 3D animation
and virtual reality technology to finish the film art
expression, the titles of the creativity and ideas are
most incisively displayed. Real digital media technol-
ogy plays an indispensable role in the production of
TV program.
The total above, design and manufacture of visible
TV titles mainly uses the actual shooting elements,
3D elements and plane elements, and through the late
synthesis software will these materials and elements
for processing and synthesis of special effects, result-
ing in television titles. Drama production often use
software including graphic design software (such as
Photoshop, Illustrator etc.), 2/3D animation software
(such as Flash, Max, Maya etc.) and post produc-
tion software (such as After Effect, Digital Fusion,
Combustion, Shake), the software is not constant, the
general is to choose to use according to the needs
of producers and creative design habits. At the same
time, the use of digital media technology, television
titles shrouded in mystery, with brilliant lustre, it show
the unrecognizable change, marks China’sTV industry
with international standards.

ABSTRACT:
Song & Chissom founded a fuzzy time series forecasting theory in 1993. But the existing fuzzy
time series forecasting model can only study the simulation and forecast of historical data. In this paper we have
presented a forecasting model of fuzzy time series based on percentages. It can predict the data about unknown
years.
1
INTRODUCTION
Classical time series forecasting theory was founded
in the middle of the last century, and is widely applied.
‘But the classical time series methods cannot deal
with the forecasting problems in wich the values of
time series are linguistic terms represented by fuzzy
sets [1, 2]’. Song & Chissom had founded a fuzzy
time series forecasting theory in 1993, and first stud-
ies the forecasting problem of the enrolments in the
University ofAlabama. It is called ‘the enrolment fore-
casting problem’ in that the values of time series are
the problem of linguistic terms represented by fuzzy
sets. Many scholars have put forward many fuzzy time
series forecasting models, and have study ‘the enrol-
ment forecasting problem’. But the existing fuzzy time
series forecasting model can only study the simulation
and forecasting of historical data. Stevenson & Porter
[4]andSaxena,Sharma&Easo[2]usedthepercentage
changes of year to year enrolments. Jilani, Burney &
Ardil [1] and Stevenson & Porter [4] and Saxena,
Sharma & Easo [2] established and applied the concept
of the inverse fuzzy numbers.This paper has presented
a Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting Model Based on Per-
centage (FTSFMBP). Because FTSFMBP can predict
the data of the unknown years, so the range of possible
applications of the FTSFMBP is much wider.

BUILDING THE FORECASTING FORMULA
OF THE FTSFMBP
The enrolments ei in the University of Alabama in
1971–1992 are found in the Table 1, as given by Song
and Chissom [3] in 1993. From table 1 we may get the
enrolment universe E = {e1971 = 13055, . . . , e1992 =
18876}. Using the formula
to compute the percentage changes in year to year
enrolments, and obtained the percentage universe P =
{P1972 = 3.89, P1973 = 2.24, . . . , D1992 = −2.38}, and
write in the Table 1. In the percentage universe P,
Pmin = −5.83, Pmax = 7.66. we take
as the unit segment, and obtained the segmented
universe of percentage as:
On the universes e, P, T, to set up the forecasting
formula of the FTSFMBP as

Application of forecasting formula (1), in the 1993
year can show that the number of forecasting values
should be nine, as shown in Table 4.
Discussion. In Table 2 we note that the enrolments
during the three years before the year 1993 (1990–
1992) are between 18876–19337.
When there is nothing unusual happening, we seek
the forecasting values of year 1993 between 18876–
19337. If there is only one value, it is a forecasting
value for 1993. If there are some other values, the mean
of these values is the forecasting value of 1993.
Here the forecasting value for 1993 is 18908
When there is good information, we need to seek
the forecasting values those greater than 19337. Here
we take 19397 or even 19873 as a forecasting value of
the 1993.
When there is collected information, the need is
to look at the forecasting value of smaller figures
than 18876. Here we take 18427 or even 18047 as
a forecasting value for 1993.
Table 2 also conveys an important message: in all
the forecasting of FTSFMBP values, the maximum
forecasting error rate is 1.2997%. The greatest fore-
casting error rate write into GFER. We hope there are
an imagine.
The greatest forecast error rate.The forecast error
rates of unknown year 1993 is not more than GFER.
Here the forecast error rate of an unknown year1993
is not more than GFER = 1.2997%.
Of course, this is only a kind of irresponsible
estimates.

CONCLUSIONS
The forecasting formula for FTSFMBP is easy to cal-
culate, and simple to structure and it is ‘the enrolment
forecasting problem for short-term fuzzy time series
forecasting models. For the simulation and forecast-
ing of historical data, FTSFMBP provide the lesser
AFER and MSE. FTSFMBP can predict the data of an
unknown year. The potential for applications of this
model could be very extensive.

ABSTRACT:
In 1993 Song and Chissom first proposed a fuzzy time series forecasting model, and applied to
study ‘the enrolment forecasting problem.’ Over the past twenty years, despite the improved forecasting models
that are constantly emerging, none have yet been given a fuzzy time series forecasting model to predict data for
an unknown year. This paper presented a fuzzy time series forecasting model based on data differences. In this
model there is a forecasting function for data in an unknown year.

INTRODUCTION
‘During last few decades, various approaches have
been developed for time series forecasting, but the
classical time series methods cannot deal with the fore-
casting problems in wich the values of time series are
linguistic terms represented by fuzzy sets’[1].To over-
come this drawback, Song & Chissom presented the
theory of fuzzy time series in 1993 [2]. ‘A fuzzy time
series model deals with both linguistic & numerical
values.’ [3] For the sake of convenience, we are calling
such questions ‘the enrolment forecasting problem.’
The basic feature of the problem is the values of
the time series represented by the linguistic terms and
fuzzy numerical values. This paper present a fuzzy
time series forecasting model based on data differ-
ence: simply written as Fuzzy Time Series Forecast-
ing Model Based on Data Difference (FTSFMBDD).
There is a simulation forecasting function about the
historical data, but the model also has a forecasting
function for the data of an unknown year. Facing a
prediction problem for the enrolment, the University
of Alabama, used to illustrate the application process
of FTSFMBDD.

THE PREPARATION WORK ON FTSFMBDD
Using the enrolments in the University of Alabama to
introduce the use of process of the FTSFMBDD, this
section is the preparation work on the FTSFMBDD.
The enrolments Ei of University of Alabama in 1971
∼1992 are shown in Table 1, as given by Song and
Chissom [2].
From table 1 we can establish the enrolment uni-
verse E = {E1971 = 13055, E1972 = 13563, . . ., E1992 =
18876}. Using the data difference formula Dj = Ej−
Ej−1 to compute the data difference in year to year
enrolments, and to obtain each year’s Data Differ-
ence (DD) and to fill in the table 1. D= {D1972 = 508,
D1973 = 304, . . ., D1992 = −461} is called the data dif-
ference universe and is also filled in Table 1. Because
Dmin = −955, Dmax = 1219, we take a unit step
obtaining the step universe
To add S6 = 1549.2 and S7 = 1807.4 in order to cal-
culate the forecasting value of an unknown year. Mod-
ified inverse fuzzy numbers Jilani, Burney and Ardil
[12] proposed the idea; we presented the forecasting
formula of FTSFMBDD:
where i = 1973, 1974, . . .; j = −5, −4, −3, −2, −1,
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

FORECASTING ANALYSIS BASED ON
HISTORICAL DATA
Using the enrolments of Alabama University during
1971∼1992 as historical data we can make simulation
and forecasting analyses. Note that in the forecasting
formula (1) in the parameter there are 13 values, so
the application of the forecasting formula (1) in each
of the years of simulation and forecasting the value
should be 13. We give the following definitions:
Definition1 In the forecasting values of a certain
years the forecasting value of the closest historical data
is called the prediction value.
According to definition 1 we calculated the pre-
diction values of the enrolments in the University of
Alabama during 1974∼1992 as filled in Table 2.
Definition 2 The maximum prediction error rate of
historical simulation forecasting values is called the
Error Rate of Experience Prediction (EREP).
From Table 2 according to the definition 2, we
obtained the EPER = 0.9006%.

COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS
The forecast results of the proposed FTSFMBDD for
the enrolments in the University of Alabama during
1973∼1992 based on historical data and the existing
literature on [2], [3], [4], [7], [8], [10], [11], [13], [14],
[15], [16] a comparison of model predictions is shown
in Table 3. From Table 3 we see the forecast value
AFER of the enrolments obtained by the FTSFMBDD
is smaller.

ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF THE
UNKNOWN 1993 YEAR
Application prediction formula (1), parameters with
j = −5, −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 by
the enrolment of 1992 can be calculated to predict the
number values of the 13 enrolments of 1993 as shown
in Table 4.
Analysis. We observed from Table 2, that the enrol-
ments during 1989–1992 are between 18876–19337.
The data does not change radically, and belongs to
the ‘stable’ period of development.
If other unexpected events occurred and assuming
therewerenone,intheforecastvaluesfor1993weseek
after the forecast values among in 18876 to 19337. In
Table 4 there are 2 values 18932 and 19192 that meet
the conditions, we use boldface to indicate them. So
the prediction value of the 1993 enrolment is 18932 or
19192.
If there is good information, select the forecast
value as 19454, or even 19718.
If there is bad information, select the forecast value
as 18673, or even 18415.
Prediction error rate estimation. The forecast
error rate of the enrolments was not greater than the
(empirical prediction error rate) EPER.
Application prediction error rate estimation, and the
prediction error rate of the prediction value of the 1993
enrolments are not greater than the experience predic-
tion error rate EPER = 0. 9006%. This is estimated by
a form and is not binding.

CONCLUSIONS
FTSFMBDD is a short-term fuzzy time series fore-
casting model of ‘the enrolment prediction problem’
The advantages of this model is that the predic-
tion formula has the advantages of a simple structure
andconvenientcalculations,whiletheaverageforecast
error rate of the prediction value of the historical data
is smaller. The FTSFMBDD not only has a simulation
prediction function for the historical data, but it also
has a prediction function for the data of an unknown
year.The application scope of FTSFMBDD is not only
for ‘the enrolment forecasting problem’.

ABSTRACT:
Against the tedious process of PPPoE campus network access authentication on the web page, the
logic flow of the client used in the router to complete the automatic certification, and part of the kernel technology
are given to develop the software available for routers using OpenWrt system. Network communication details
are obtained and further simulated through Firebug tool, the graphical user configuration interface, based on the
LuCi framework, and the bridging technology is used to solve the IPv6 connectivity issues in subnet devices.
Automatic account login and certification can be completed by the router, and the concise interface enables users
to timely view their account status, modify their settings and monitor traffic. Through compiling and debugging,
the software has successfully achieved these functions.

INTRODUCTION
Campusnetworksaretoprovideteaching,researchand
integratednetworkinformationservices[12]forteach-
ers and students within a school. The traditional cam-
pus network originally accesses the Internet using a
fixed IP, however, with the depletion of IPv4 addresses
in worldwide, more campus networks launch the way
of PPPoE to use IPv6 resources. Point-to-Point Proto-
col over Ethernet (PPPoE)) is a point to point protocol
over Ethernet achieving authentication, encryption
andcompressionfunctions.ComparedwithIPv4,IPv6
networks can achieve barrier-free access to Google,
Wikipedia and other network services deployed IPv6
[6], which will greatly benefit the research study and
work life for university teachers and students.
However, there are some inconveniences in the
current way to access campus network.
1.1
Complicated login authentication
After using the PPPoE dial-up software to certify their
own legitimate status, users still need to pass the
web verification on the PC side. The restart of router
requires users to re-authenticate on the PC side after
power failure. In general, the campus laboratories and
dormitories will be power off at night for safety, so it is
a cumbersome process for users to repeat certification
on the PC side every day.
1.2
Subnet devices
IPv6 uses stateless address allocation mechanism [9],
subnet devices accessing to low-level commercial
routers cannot go on IPv6 communication with the
parent network.
1.3
Subnet devices
Part of campus networks make charges, based on the
use of traffic, providing different monthly traffic sub-
scription plans. If users do not promptly login the
self-service system to query the traffic amount, caus-
ing the amount having been used exceeding the limit,
the user will be required to pay a relatively expensive
cost.
Owing to the drawbacks in using the campus net-
work, this paper aims to develop a program which
runs in router to replace the external network login
authentication on the web page, login self-service sys-
tem, account cancellation, and a series of manual
operations. Meanwhile, the software needs to timely
feedback the traffic usage to the user in an intuitive
way and allow subnet devices to successfully access
IPv6 resources.

Wrt system.

A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
2.1
OpenWrt
This design uses one router installing the OpenWrt
system to do development. OpenWrt is a Linux distri-
bution for embedded devices and it provides a writable
file system for adding packages, and so develop-
ers can directly develop required applications without
building the entire effort required for firmware.
2.2
LuCi
LuCi [1] is one part of OpenWrt components, provid-
ing a free, simple, extensible, and easy maintenance
Web user interface for embedded devices.
2.3
OpenWrt Buildroot
OpenWrt Buildroot [7] does cross-compile for the
client software.
2.4
Firebug
Firebug [5] acts as a packet capture tool for analysing
the Web authentication process.
In addition, the TP-LINK WR703N router that we
used in this design was modified. To achieve the basic
requirements to install and run the client program,
the original 4MB flash memory of the router was
expanded to 16MB flash memory and 64MB RAM.

MODULE DESIGN
3.1
Program module in OpenWrt
The execution flow of general software in OpenWrt
system is shown in Figure 1. In accordance with the
design objectives and the program invocation in Open-
Wrt, we divide this software into three parts: the
network operating module, logic control module, and
user interface.
3.2
Network operating module
This module is a pre-compiled Shell program, corre-
sponding to the ‘Program’ function in Figure 1. The
Shell program sets up four kinds of invocation, respec-
tively corresponding to login to the self-service sys-
tem, login to the Internet, maintain the login state and
logout operations. The Shell program obtains param-
eters from corresponding invocation commands, and
the formats of these commands are as follows.
– Login the self-service system: Tju_Login 1 User-
name Password
– Login the Internet: Tju_Login 2 Username Pass-
word
– Maintain the login state: Tju_Login 3
– Logout: Tju_Login 4 Username Password
However, the function of this client we design is
not just the successive implementation of the above-
mentioned four basic communication operations. In
order to maintain online state and monitor the use of
traffic, the client needs to constantly repeat commu-
nication operations with the authentication server. In
addition, the client needs to make appropriate judg-
ments taking into account the occurrence of various
abnormal conditions, such as the wrong login infor-
mation, flow depletion, and other issues. Therefore,
we need a dedicated logic control process to manage
the four basic communication actions in this module.
3.3
Logic control module
This module is a bash script, defining two sub func-
tions,
Tju_init()andTju_Login().Betweenthem,Tju_init()
specifically achieve the function of logging in the self-
service system, checking the remaining traffic, and
disabling the account with excessively low remaining
traffic. While the role of Tju_Login() is to take use of
the available account checked byTju_init() function to
execute login operation, and then call the ‘stay on the
line’ function of the program to maintain login state.
When the remaining traffic of one account is insuf-
ficient, it will log off the account and switch to the
next available account. The implementation process
of Tju_Login() is shown in Figure 2.
When the router starts, by calling the Shell program,
this module achieves the function of checking status,
maintaining an online state and monitoring traffic for
every account it reads.
3.4
User interface
This design uses a defined LuCi framework to build
the user interface, and adopts the Module, View, Con-
troller(MVC)three-layerarchitecture[10][4]:Module
layer defines the configuration variables; it reads the
value of variables from the Web and then writes the
value into a configuration file, completing the oper-
ation of modifying the program configuration on the
Web page. The view layer is mainly for defining the
exclusive visual effect of the interface. The controller

layer defines the entrance of the module, equivalent
to registering a dedicated configuration interface in
LuCi. In this design, the file path of the controller
layer is /usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/.
Users can set the username and password in the
LuCi interface, and set the login and logout thresh-
old of the remaining traffic. Besides, users can also
add multiple different account information. When the
remaining flow of one account is lower than the thresh-
old, the program will logout this account and enable
the next available one to log in.

PART OF THE CORE TECHNOLOGY
4.1
HTTP communication
This design uses the library function of LibCurl [8]
to carry out HTTP communication with the authen-
tication server [2], similar to the multi-layer structure

modeinnetworkcommunication.LibCurlprovidesthe
configuration of the underlying protocol and a calling
interface for developers, while shielding the concrete
steps.TheprogramsbasedonLibCurlmainlyadoptthe
call back function to complete their transfer tasks.The
formats of call back functions are as follows. Wherein,
contents points to the received data, while userp is
specified by the user.
size_t WriteBackToString(void * contents, size_t
size, size_t nmemb, char * userp)
The following codes are used to implement the dec-
laration and initialization of the crul handle. Among
them, the curl_easy_setopt is to configure the curl
handle.
CURL * curl;
CURLcode res;
curl = curl_easy_init();
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url); //

NULL) ;

4.2
IPv6 bridge
Currently, the IPv6 portion of the campus network
uses the Neighbour Discovery Protocol [11], which is
a stateless address configuration, for address assign-
ment. For gateway and subnet devices, they can get
available addresses by directly accessing the network
using this way of address distribution. However, the
router accessing the network can obtain a valid IPv6
address with a prefix length 64, but cannot continue
subnet division based on this address, therefore can-
not continue to assign IPv6 addresses to those devices
with access to the router via LAN or WLAN.
21

Figure 4.
IPv6 bridge script.
In this case, to allow subnet devices to successfully
access the IPv6 network, our design uses IPv6 bridg-
ing technology [3], directly bridging the subnet and the
parent network through script commands, and masks
the IPv4 packet transmission in the bridge. The func-
tion of this part depends on the ebtables package in
OpenWrt, and the schematic diagram and the script of
the IPv6 bridging are shown in Figures 3 and 4.
In the above script, eth0 and eth1 corresponds to
the WAN and LAN wired network card of the router,
while wlan0 and wlan1 to the wireless network card.
Tests proved that as long as the WAN port and the
LAN port own at least one network interface, the script
can be executed normally and the IPv6 bridge will be
successfully built. Besides, the last ebtables command
isusedtoshieldtheIPv4transmitpacketsinthebridge.
4.3
Child functions
Functions of some child functions in the original Shell
codes are given in this section.
– int Login_Internet (char *id, char *pass): Call the
Post function to execute the operation of logging in
the Internet.
– int Post (char *url, char *data, char *cookie, char
*writeback):A customized Post operation, the call-
back function has been set as WriteBackToString.
This function will read the http response header, if
the header contains the set-cookie field, then the
content of the field will be stored in the file indi-
cated by the string cookie. This function is the first
step towards logging into a self-service system.
– size_t WriteBackProcess (void *contents, size_t
size, size_t nmemb, char *user p): The specific
callback function when logging in the self-service
system. This function finds the remaining flow
value from the self-service system, and stores the
value in the string indicated by userp.
– double Get_Rid_Of_Comma (char *str):This func-
tion will format the string containing the value of
the remaining flow, and then return the value in the
form of a double-precision floating point.
– int Keep_Alive(): This function will call the GET
function to maintain login state, and output and
display the remaining flow value.
Figure 5.
Menu config interface.
– size_t WriteBackToString (void *contents, size_t
size, size_t nmemb, char *user p):A call back func-
tion called when executing the operation of HTTP
POST or GET. This function writes the content
returning from the server to the string pointed by
userp.
– int Log_Out (char *id, char *pass): This function
calls the Post function to perform logout operation.

PREFERENCES, SYMBOLS AND UNITS
All compiling operations are carried out in Ubuntu
14.04 LTS. In the OpenWrt Buildroot compiler envi-
ronment, the source codes of the client were uploaded
to the router, and then got installation and running after
cross compiling.
5.1
Compile
The compilation process will first put the folder con-
taining the source tju_login under the folder package,
then enter the root directory of OpenWrt Buildroot,
generating a corresponding configuration file. Related
commands are as follows:
make defconfig
make menuconfig
Second, remove excess options and tick the
tju_login in Utilities, as shown in Figure 5.
At last execute the compilation, and the following
is the command: make package/tju_login/compileV=
s CC= architecture-openwrt-linux-uclibc-gcc LD=
architecture-openwrt-linux-uclibc-ld
5.2
Instruction
After compilation, the directory of the generated ipk
installation package is /bin/ar71xx/packages/. In order
to install the ipk package on the router, it should first
be uploaded to the router device. The command of
using SSH link to upload the ipk package to the tmp
directory of router is as follows:
scp ./bin/ar71xx/packages/tju_login_1_ar71xx.ipk
root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/tju_login_1_ar71xx.ipk
22

Figure 6.
The operating results of every account.
Then execute the opkg installation:
ssh root@192.168.1.1 opkg install /tmp/tju_login
_1_ar71xx.ipk
5.3
Debug
Visit http://192.168.1.1, and login the router set-
ting page, then set account information in the ‘net-
work/tju_login’. The information of three accounts in
the configuration file is shown as follows.
Account 1 WRONG: set as the wrong login infor-
mation.
Account 2 HeShu: login information is correct, but
the remaining flow is lower than the threshold (set as
3000B).
Account 3 Sunny: login information is correct and
the remaining traffic is higher than the threshold.
If submitting the debugger request in the user
interface, we cannot observe the specific process
of program execution. Therefore, we start the pro-
gram directly by running one script. After writing the
configuration file, we directly execute the following
command to debug:
./etc/init.d/Tju_Login restart ≫./tmp/a.txt
Look at the operating results of every account
in a.txt, and the corresponding results are shown in
Figure 6.
See from the results, the program correctly filtered
out the account "WRONG" with false login infor-
mation and the account ‘HeShu’ which traffic was
insufficient, while the account ‘Sunny’showed normal
access to external network. Besides it also updated the
PPPoE login information and then performed the login
operation.
5.4
Detect boot from start
In this section, we set the boot of the program with the
starting up of the router to test its start situation. First,
we need to add the program to the start up items of the
system:
./etc/init.d/Tju_Login enable
Then execute the restart operation of the router:
reboot
After the restart is completed, we need:
– DetecttheaccesstotheInternet,visithttp://cnbeta.com,
and the result is normal.
– DetecttheIPv6access,visithttp://ipv6.google.com,
and the result shows normal.

CONCLUSION
This paper introduces the work done for the design
and implementation of a campus network automatic
authentication software running on the router side,
mainly used to solve the drawbacks existing in the
actual usage of a campus network. Through compil-
ing, installation and testing, the software successfully
implements the convenient IPv6 access to a campus
network.
Innovation of this article:
– Change the originally cumbersome certification
process on Web page into automatically authen-
ticatation in the router for the campus network,
avoiding the mannual operation on the PC side,
which brings convenience to teachers and students
in collage.
– Traffic monitoring.The software will automatically
disconnect with the Internet when the remaining
traffic value falls below a preset threshold, thus
avoiding high network costs.
– Provide a LuCi interface based on the MVC three-
tier architecture. Users can set account-related
information, and timely view the usage state of the
traffic in this interface.
– Provide barrier-free IPv6 accessment for subnet
users by bridging technology, enabling them to
smoothly access a wealth of educational resources
at home and abroad.

ABSTRACT:
Based on Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT), the targets tracking platform which embedded
location and colour cues into the PF was developed, and the basic framework and algorithm of fusing multi-
source information were described. Results showed that the conflict strategy and DSmT combination model
were available, and the proposed approach exhibited a significantly better performance for dealing with high
conflict between evidences than a conventional PF. As a result, the approach was suitable for real-time visual
target tracking, and it can easily be generalized to deal with larger number of visual targets and additional cues
based on complicated environment.

INTRODUCTION
Visual targets’ tracking is one of the research hotspots
in the field of computer vision. In the last fifteen
years we have witnessed a rapid development in the
theory of Particle Filters (PF), and the correspond-
ing algorithms of PF are widely applied in tracking
fields [1,2]. Although lots of algorithms have been
introduced to track moving targets in different cases,
these approaches have mainly improved local perfor-
mances by optimizing PF algorithms, and there still
exist many key issues which need to be discussed
further. Recently,
Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) by Dezert
and Smarandache has to be viewed as a general flex-
ible bottom-up approach for managing uncertainty
and conflicts for a wide class of static or dynamic
fusion problems where the information to combine
is modeled as a finite set of belief functions pro-
vided by different independent sources of evidence
[3]. The corresponding researches showed the con-
flicting focal elements were increased, as based on
DSmT,andthecomputationaleffortwasalsoincreased
in the course of reasoning. Based on this matter of
fact, improved methods were presented to reduce the
computational efforts. At present, some researches
focused on visual target identification based on DSmT,
while the related studies of visual target tracking
based on DSmT are much fewer. The aim of this
article is to present a novel approach to visual tar-
get tracking that will handle the targets of crosses and
occlusions in order to attain an excellent information
fusion [4–6].

TARGETS TRACKING
2.1
Combining rule
According to the above discussion, an improved com-
bination rule of conflict redistribution is introduced
by improving the disposal way for the conflict’s focal
elements. The basic idea of conflict redistribution rule
based on DSmT is described as follows: (1) the conflict
information is only produced by the conflicts between
certain focal element information t (2) when the con-
flict information and uncertain information or conflict
information between them are combined, the uncer-
tainty of the combining rule is increased greatly. (3)
when the conflict information and single focal element
of producing the conflict are combined, the conflict
information is redistributed to the single focal element
according to the combination results.
In order to describe the total level of conflicts
between evidences efficiently, an influence coefficient
R is introduced to address the conflict level. Based on
the mass function, the conflict level can be corrected
by R, and the corresponding expression of R is given
by [7, 8].
whereA denotes the single focal element of identifica-
tion framework, m1, m2 denotes the basic probability
25

assignment function of two evidence sources, respec-
tively.
According to Eq. (1), when the influence coefficient
R tends to 1, the conflict between evidences is strenu-
ous, and the conflicts are partly transferred to a union
ofconflictingfocalelements.Whentheinfluencecoef-
ficient R tends to 0, the conflicts between evidences
are very weak, and they are partly transferred to the
conflicting focal elements.As a result, the correspond-
ing combining rule of conflict redistribution between
evidences is defined as follows.
where r denotes the absolute reliability of evidence,
and S denotes the degree of support based on the D-S
evidence theory.
2.2
Tracking model
According to the above discussion, the following
established objects tracking model of objects track-
ing by using colour and position cues, based on
conflict redistribution DSmT. In order to describe
conveniently, the tracking model of two objects was
established as an example.
For two objects,  was defined as follows:
Let define {qFA(u)}m
u=1 as the histogram of the scene
from which subtract the histogram of objects 1 and 2.
The probability that s(n)
t,j belongs to the false alarm
hypothesis was given by
The mass functions of particle n according to color
can be evaluated as follows:

rior p(Xt|Zt) distribution is calculated using belief

Based on the above discussion, the generalization
of the tracking scheme described in this section to τ
targets can be carried out by defining a frame of dis-
cernment  = {θ1, . . . , θτ, θ1 ∪· · · ∪θτ}, where θj are
individual targets and θ1 ∪· · · ∪θτ is the false alarm
hypothesis. Hence, the same method can be adopted
to establish a dynamic combination model of τ targets
in the framework of the DSmT.
2.3
Tracking realization
Based on the above analysis of combination strategy
and a dynamic model for targets tracking in targets
crosses and occlusions, the corresponding algorithm
of multi-source information fusion was realized in
the framework of the DSmT. The algorithm by merg-
ing location and colour cues was embedded in the
tracking frame of PF, and the whole tracking pro-
cess included a read module of video sequences,
a setting parameter module, a preprocessing mod-
ule of video images, a detecting module of moving
targets, and a tracking module of moving targets.
Figure 1 shows the basic framework of the tracking
process.

TRACKING EXAMPLES
A tracking example under occluding conditions was
tested to validate the correctness of the tracking
method by using improved combination rules based
on the DSmT. The image scene came from a small
region, and there were only two cross and closely
spaced objects in the region. For the sake of clarity, the
girl was denoted as object 1, and the boy was denoted
as object 2. In order to analyse them conveniently, the
two persons in the video scene kept uniform motion
along the moving direction of cross and occlusion.
The tracking sequence was divided into three phases:
phase 1 was the pre-occlusion sequence, phase 2 cor-
responded to the occlusion sequence, and phase 3
was the post-occlusion sequence. Tracking in phase 2
was challenged due to the closeness of the object,
which perturbs the measured cues and might have
led to a false identification. In the process of objects’
occlusion locally or wholly, there were high conflict
problems including scale variations, cross and closely
spaced objects. As a result, the tracking experiment
was achieved based on the improved combination rule,
and each object was tracked using 25 particles aver-
agely. Figure 2 shows the tracking process of main
frames and tracking result.
It could be seen from frame 145 to frame 175 that
the tracking accuracy was maintained even when the
target was blocked locally or wholly. Especially, the
positioncuelostgraduallyitsabilitytoseparateobjects
1 and 2 as they converged to the intersection point in
frame 145. However, the position cue remained a valid
measurement because it was independent from the rel-
ative position of objects with respect to the camera
(occluding or occluded).The colour cue was extremely
sensitive to the occlusion.
Based on the above experiment’s results, the cor-
responding error analysis of tracking objects in the
direction of level and vertical was discussed.The value
of object tracking minus the value of a real object was
defined as the mean error. Figure 3 shows the tracking
error for target 1 by comparing with the conventional
PF approach.
Figure 3.

target 1.
It was very obvious that the introduced method had
a small tracking error when the object was occluded
locally or wholly, but the error change was very visible
from frame 145 to frame 200 by using the conventional
PF. The tracking mean error was increased greatly
when high conflict evidences were handled by using
the conventional approach. Especially, the tracking
almost failed from frame 145 to frame 175, owing
to the occluded objects being fully based on the con-
ventional PF. Hence, the correctness of the introduced
method was unsuspected according to the tracking
results and error analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on DSmT, this article mainly addressed visual
target tracking in a complicated environment, and the
introduced approach has been tested and evaluated.
Experimental results have been demonstrated that this
approach ameliorated the interference immunity for
tracking targets. DSmT is a useful theory for dealing
with uncertainty problems. Study demonstrated that
DSmT fusing high conflict among evidences had lots
of difficulties for analysing a conflict’s focal element.
An improved combination rule of conflict redistribu-
tion based on DSmT was introduced to settle high
conflict among evidences. Simulation results shown
that the basic belief assignment of main focal element
A was increased efficiently by the suggested combi-
nation rule, and the value of focal element A could be
converged stably by a fusing of 10 times.

community

ABSTRACT:
In this paper, we proposed a friendship network model in a fixed community based on such
connection mechanisms as: random selection and triadic-closure. That means each node in the network can
strike up friendships with strangers randomly or its two-hop neighbours (friends of its friends). We simulated the
network structure with NetworkX and found it exhibits important network topological properties: short diameters,
high clustering coefficients, and various shapes of in-degree distributions. We found that clustering coefficients
and the shapes of in-degree distributions are both related to the ratio between triadic-closure probability and
random probability. Accordingly, we gave a simple method to distinguish the effect of triadic-closure on the
structure of friendship networks in the real world from a random connection.

BACKGROUND
In recent years, there has been considerable interest
in complex networks arising in social life, largely
because their contribution to human understanding
of various social structures and processes, such as
how people meet and make friends from strangers
(Van et al. 2003), search information and obtain
job opportunities (Granovetter 1973). The studies of
social networks mainly focus on two related tracks:
the static properties of network topological structures
observed from the real world data, e.g., movie actors
networks (Watts & Strogatz 1998), scientific collabo-
ration networks (Newman 2001; Barabâsi et al. 2002),
onlinefriendshipnetworks(Backstrometal.2012),the
dynamical evolving processes measured from some
network generation models, e.g., Erdös-Rényi model
(ERDdS 1959), Barabási-Albert model (Albert et al.
1999; Bianconi & Barabási 2001), copying model
(Kleinberg et al. 1999), forest fire model (Leskovec
et al. 2007).
Social networks are composed of a lot of peo-
ple or groups who are linked together according to
a variety of relationships. The variety of connection
mechanisms lead to complex network structures. In the
previous studies, we have learned that social networks
are very different from random and regular networks.
They always have properties of small shortest paths
(Backstrom et al. 2012), high clustering coefficients,
scale-free degree distributions, and so on. Some of
these features are also seen in the world wide web
(Albert et al. 1999;Adamic & Huberman 2000; Broder
et al. 2000), internet (Yook et al. 2002), and biological

networks (Wagner & Fell 2001). How do these features
emerge in social networks? There may be combina-
tions of one or more mechanisms that are connecting
people together. For example, homophily – the ten-
dency of individuals to associate with those who are
similar to themselves (Tarbush & Teytelboym 2013),
mutual interests (Singer et al. 2009), the maximum-
likelihood principle (Leskovec et al. 2008), the closure
of short network cycles (Kossinets & Watts 2006),
and drive people to interact with each other and social
networks evolve over times.To observe these phenom-
ena, a lot of network models have been proposed to
reproduce statistical properties in the real world.
The most celebrated model is the Barabási-Albert
(BA) model (Albert et al. 1999), in which when a new
node joins the network, it creates a constant number
of edges, where the destination node of each edge is
chosen proportional to the destination’s degree. The
BA model reproduces the scale-free network with
power law degree distribution, and reveals such a phe-
nomenon ‘richer get richer’ in social networks. There
are also some alternative models based on the prefer-
ential attachment mechanisms (Bianconi & Barabási
2001; Albert & Barabási 2000). David in his studies
showed that ‘winners don’t take all’, and gave an alter-
native model which combined preferential attachment
and random connection (Pennock et al. 2002). Copy-
ing model (Kleinberg et al. 1999) and forest fire model
(Leskovec et al. 2007) were based on attaching new
nodes to the network by copying or burning through
existingedges.Thesemodelsreproduceddensification
and shrinking diameters in social networks. Jure, Lars,
Ravi and Andrew (Leskovec et al. 2008) attributed
the macroscopic network properties to the maximum-
likelihood principle and proposed a model based
on triadic-closure mechanisms. Jackson and Rogers
29

(Jackson & Rogers 2007) additionally suggested that
‘friends of a friend’are more likely to link in friendship
networks. Based on these theories, Davidsen, Ebel and
Bornholdt (Davidsen et al. 2002) modelled acquain-
tance networks based on local interactions. Vazquez
(Vazquez 2003), Yuta, Ono, and Fujiwara (Yuta et al.
2007) respectively proposed CNN (connecting near-
est neighbours) model and CNNR (connecting nearest
neighbours with apparently random linkage) model
both based on the basic assumption: the evolution
of social connections is mainly determined by the
creation of new relations between pairs of individuals.
The models mentioned above are all growth net-
works. In the whole process, new nodes join the net-
works continuously and link edges to existing nodes.
Somemodels(Leskovecetal.2008)alsodefinedalife-
time for each node upon arrival. Though these models
have properly defined individual node behaviours and
reproduced some statistical properties such as power
law node degree distributions and small diameters,
there are still some social networks such as who-trusts-
whom (Richardson 2002)whichhasaconstantnumber
of nodes. Singer H M, Singer I, and Herrmann (Singer
et al. 2009) found that the mutual interest is the domi-
nant factor for the friendships. According to this, they
proposed a model to understand the structure of social
networks in a fixed setting. Marta, Pedro and Hans
(González et al. 2006) also proposed a model of mobile
agents to construct social networks, based on a system
of moving particles by keeping track of the collisions
during their permanence in the system. In these two
models, the numbers of nodes were constant. Deep-
ayan, Yiping and Christos (Chakrabarti et al. 2004)
gave a ‘recursive matrix’ (R-MAT) model which can
generate weighted, directed, and bipartite graphs with
a constant of nodes.

INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we try to propose a new model to
construct a directed friendship network in a fixed
community such as in a class of a university. This
is an important scene in social network areas. The
connection mechanism leading to individuals mak-
ing friends with each other in the model combines
random and triadic-closure rules. Triadic-closure is
always called ‘friends of a friend’ in friendship net-
work which also appears in previous papers (Jackson
& Rogers 2007; Vazquez 2003; Yuta et al. 2007). It is
really an important element driving the evolution of
social networks.
There are three main ingredients in our model. First,
the network is evolving in a fixed community. In the
whole process, the number of nodes is a constant.
No node is added in or moved out. And we do not
model a lifetime to keep nodes from producing new
edges. Second, the connection mechanisms in the net-
work are based on both random and triadic-closure
rules. That means each individual in the friendship
network can strike up friendships with strangers who

are selected randomly, or selected from friends of
his friends. Third, each edge in the network is direc-
tional. That means the friendships between each pair
of individuals are not symmetrical. Figure 1 shows the
connection mechanisms in the friendship network.
Our model is simple and easy to implement. It con-
tains all the structure features listed above. In section
3, we show the simulations of the friendship network
developing process based on our model and reproduce
various properties such as diameters, clustering coef-
ficients, in-degree distributions for different values of
random probability and triadic-closure probability. In
section 4, we give a brief summary of our works.

SIMULATION
Social networks always are analysed as graphs which
are combined with a set of nodes and a set of edges.
We define N nodes in the friendship network with zero
initial edges. During each time interval, we select one
node (i as identity) randomly who can interact and
make friends with others. Node i chooses the des-
tination node and produces a friendship link, based
on a two basis mechanism: random selection and
triadic-closure. If node i chooses the destination node
randomly from the whole network, the probability of
node i producing a new edge is p. If node i chooses the
destination node from its two-hop neighbours (friends
of its friends), the probability of node i producing a
new edge is q. During the whole network developing
process, these two mechanisms are effective simulta-
neously. Figure 1 also shows the evolving mechanisms
in our model.
In each simulation, the number of nodes N is
assigned a constant number 1000. The random proba-
bility p and triadic-closure probability q are assigned
different values between 0 and 1. To smooth out
measurement deviations of the friendship network
properties, we simulated the network evolving process
by a hundred times and averaged the measured values.
3.1
The diameter
Figure 2 shows the diameters of the friendship net-
works when average degrees rise to 10 and 50 (the

total numbers of edges are 10000 and 50000). In Fig-
ure 2(a), when p is smaller than q, the diameters are
a little larger. When p is larger than q, the diame-
ters are stable and remain at a lower level. The same
phenomenon also appears in Figure 2(b). The small
diameters reveal the statistical phenomena of a small-
world in social networks (Milgram 1967). In Figure
2(a), while random probability is larger than triadic-
closure probability, there are at least 5747 edges which
are produced randomly. But when random probability
p = 0.01 and triadic-closure probability q = 0.99, the
diameter is 10, there are only 1253 edges produced
randomly. In Figure 2(b), the diameters are almost at
the same level. Even though when p = 0.01, q = 0.99,
thereare1895edgesproducedrandomly,andthediam-
eter is only 6.The small diameters in Figure 2 show that
random connection is an important element leading
to a short distance between individuals in friendship
networks. The results also match some studies in WS
and NW small-world models (Watts & Strogatz 1998;
Newman &Watts 1999). Both these two models gener-
atedsmall-worldnetworksthroughreconnectingedges
or adding new edges randomly in regular networks.

works for several different values of random probability and

N = 1000, (a) and (b) are measured while the average degree
is 10 and 50.
3.2
Clustering coefficient
Figure 3 shows the clustering coefficients in the friend-
ship networks based on our model. The two figures
both consist of two parts: p > q and p < q.While p > q,
the clustering coefficients are lower and the slope of
the curved surface is gentler. As q rises, the clustering
coefficients rise too. Especially while p < q, the clus-
tering coefficients are much higher and the slope of the
curved surface is steep. In Figure 3(a), the clustering
coefficient is 0.0205 at coordinate (p = 0.99, q = 0.01)
and 0.3052 at coordinate (p = 0.01, q = 0.99). In Fig-
ure 3(b), the clustering coefficient is 0.0980 at coor-
dinate (p = 0.99, q = 0.01) and 0.2175 at coordinate
(p = 0.01, q = 0.99).All the clustering coefficients are
much higher than a random graph with the same nodes
and edges. The results reveal that triadic-closure rule
(connection based on friends of a friend) in the friend-
ship network is an important element leading to high
clustering coefficients.
In Figures 2 and 3, we can find that, at the lowest
point of the curved surfaces, the friendship networks
nearly approach to random networks which have prop-
erties of short diameters. At the top of the curved

surface, the friendship networks nearly approach to
networks completely produced according to triadic-
closure rules, which have properties of high clustering
coefficients.The effect of triadic-closure probability q
on clustering coefficients is closely related to the value
of random probability p. As p increases, the effect of
q on clustering coefficients reduces. In Figure 3(a),
while p = q and average degree is 10, the cluster-
ing coefficients in the friendship networks are around
0.0870. In Figure 3(b), while p = q and average degree
is 50, the clustering coefficients are around 0.1074.
These results reveal such a phenomenon: while q/p is
a constant, clustering coefficients nearly remain at a
stable level. In simulations, we also find a truth: while
p = q, no matter what values (0.01 or 0.99) assigned
to them, the ratio of edges, produced randomly to
edges and produced according to triadic-closure rules,
appears to be nearly uniform. It is the main cause of
the stable clustering coefficient.
Figure 4 additionally shows the relationship
between a clustering coefficient and the value of q/p
while average degrees are 10 and 50. Both in Fig-
ure 4(a) and in Figure 4(b), we can observe that no
matter what value p is, the curves are nearly coincident.
That means clustering coefficient of the friendship net-
work, based on our model, is uncorrelated with the
value of p. As long as q/p remains constant, the clus-
tering coefficient nearly stays the same.As the value of
q/p rises, the clustering coefficient increases. A clus-
tering coefficient is proportional to the ratio of q to
p. It is easy to observe the relationship: the cluster-
ing coefficient increases non-linearly with the value of
q/p. While q/p is near to zero, the friendship networks
are near to random networks, clustering coefficients
are near to 0.02 in Figure 4(a) and 0.098 in Figure 4
(b). These values also match clustering coefficients
in random networks which have the same numbers of
nodes and edges. In Figure 4, we can get such a result:
in a sparse friendship network, the value of cluster-
ing coefficients can indicate the effect of the intensity
of triadic-closure rules that lead to the structures of
networks.
3.3
In-degree distribution
Degree distribution is another important property in
social networks. There are many studies that have
revealed that social networks have a power law degree
distributions (Newman 2001; Barabâsi et al. 2002).
We give some in-degree distributions of the friend-
ship networks for several different values of random
probabilities p and triadic-closure probabilities q in
Figure 5. In Figure 5(a), while p and q are very small
(p = 0.01, q = 0.01), the in-degree distribution is Pois-
son. While p remains very small and q rises much
higher (p = 0.01, q = 0.95), the in-degree distribution
has such a shape which has a lot of small degree
nodes and a heavy tail. While q is a little higher
than p (p = 0.01, q = 0.1), the in-degree distribution
has such a qualitative shape – unimodal body and
heavy tail, which combines the two shape above (while
q = 0.01 and q = 0.95). In Figure 5(b), p grows a little
(p = 0.1), while q is less than or equal to p (q = 0.01
or q = 0.1), in-degree distributions are both Poisson.
While q = 0.95, in-degree distribution also changes, it
turns to the shape – unimodal body and heavy tail. In
Figure 5(c), while p grows to 0.3, all in-degree dis-
tributions are Poisson, no matter how high q is. The
larger q is, the lower the peak of Poisson is.
Figure 5 once again reveals that in-degree dis-
tributions in the friendship networks are not only
related with triadic probability q or random proba-
bility p, but related to the value of q/p. As the value
of q/p increases (q increases or p reduces), in-degree
distributions turn from Poisson to heavy tail. It is sim-
ilar to the phenomena of clustering coefficients in
Figures 3 and 4. The friendship networks based on
random and triadic-closure rules have various struc-
ture properties according to different values of p and q.
Diameters are mainly related to p. The friendship net-
works exhibit short diameters once there are enough

random connections. Clustering coefficients and in-
degree distributions are mainly related to the value
of q/p.
From all the results, we can get a method of how
to judge which mechanism has more effect in real
world friendship networks. The detailed steps of the

method are as follows: first, we measure the numbers
of nodes and edges in a friendship network and its clus-
tering coefficient; second, we calculate the connection
probability of the random network which has the same
numbers of nodes and edges; third, we refer to the cor-
responding curves of clustering coefficients and the
values of q/p which are shown in Figure 6. We then
estimate the triadic-closure probability. Meanwhile,
we can plot the figures of diameters and in-degree
distributions as further references. Accordingly, we
can make a judgment as to how much random con-
nections or triadic-closure rules effect the structure of
friendship networks in the real world.
In Figure 6, we can observe a phenomenon: while
average degree is low, clustering coefficient varies
apparently in a board range as long as the value of
q/p changes. As the average degree rises, the curves
of clustering coefficients vary gently and increase
on the whole. Each curve represents the relationship
between the clustering coefficient and the ratio of
triadic-closure probability to random probability in
a friendship network with different average degrees.
Thus, it is easy to judge the effect of triadic-closure
rules or random connections in a sparse friendship
network. The method is less effective when friendship
connections are dense in a network. That is because
clustering coefficients are almost at a stable level. It is
difficult for us to distinguish the corresponding value
of q/p.

CONCLUSIONS
Friendship is one of the most normal relationships
between individuals in social life. It is also an impor-
tant element constituting the complex social network.
Though there are a lot of models proposed to explain
how social networks form and evolve, they mainly

networks in a fixed community.The connection mech-
anism reveals that in the real world, individuals may
meet someone and make friendships through random
opportunities, while they can also make new friends
by introductions from their friends
In simulations, we assign random probability p
and triadic-closure probability q with different val-
ues. We generate a lot of friendship networks with
various topological structures. We find that the prop-
erties of friendship networks are related with both p
and q. In particular, clustering coefficients are propor-
tional to the value of q/p and the shapes of in-degree
distributions are also related to the value of q/p.
Accordingly, we give a method to distinguish the effect
of triadic-closure from random connection in a friend-
ship network. The results give a specific explanation:
how these various topological properties emerge in
the friendship networks based on mixed connection
mechanisms and which mechanism performs greater
effects. There is no doubt that our work is useful for
people to realize some special properties of social
networks in the real world.

ABSTRACT:
Cloud computing is a current vital issue with the global IT community and universities are
the cradles for cultivating talents for the country. In order to promote university informatization construction
and improve the competitiveness of universities, it is the general trend to apply cloud computing technology to
universities. This paper focuses on the application of cloud computing in university informatization construction
andanalysesthesignificanceofthecloudcomputingtouniversitydevelopment,combinedwiththecharacteristics
of cloud computing.

CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing is considered both a technology and
a kind of service model. From a technical point of view,
it is another innovation after the information revolu-
tion. From the service model, it provides IaaS, PaaS,
and SaaS, these kinds of service models that cover the
entire IT ecosystem. Cloud computing as a new tech-
nology or service mode has different characteristics
from those in former internet technology.
1.1
Definition of cloud computing
Cloud computing is a super computing model
connected via the internet, including distributed com-
puting, parallel computing, and grid computing tech-
nology, and it is a new service delivery and usage
pattern, under the foundation of an open standard and
service and the internet centre, to provide safe and
fast data storage and computing services.The network
for providing resources of data storage and comput-
ing services is known as cloud.[1] Cloud computing
is a new shared infrastructure model, connecting a
huge pool of resources together, as operators and cus-
tomers, through the internet, providing various kinds
of storage and computing resources for users. In the
cloud computing environment, users using a variety
of personal computer terminals, PDA, mobile phones,
etc, put a large amount of information and proces-
sor resources together for collaborating work.[2] It is
a large scale distributed computing mode, determined
bytheoperators’economicscale,abstract,andavirtual
and dynamic variable.
1.2
Characteristics of cloud computing
The characteristics of cloud computing are as follows.
1.2.1
The large scale power of data storage and
computing
“The cloud” has a considerable size, giving the user
a calculating ability hitherto unknown. For example,
Google cloud computing has about 1000000 servers
Amazon, IBM, Yahoo, and Microsoft “cloud” have
hundreds of thousands of servers; even though in gen-
eral the common private enterprises’cloud computing
also have hundreds to thousands of servers.[3] Thus,
the competence of data storage and computing given
by cloud computing is hitherto unknown.
1.2.2
Resource virtualization
Virtualization refers to the underlying hardware com-
prehensive virtualization, including servers, storage
and networking equipment, to build a shared resource
pool under the basis of a demand assignment. Cloud
computing supports users at any location using a
variety of terminal and access application services.
1.2.3
High reliability
“The cloud” guarantees high reliability service, using
measures of more copies of data fault tolerance and
computing and isomorphic interchangeable nodes,
as well as being more secure than any local computer.
1.2.4
Universality
Cloud computing does not specify particular applica-
tions, and one cloud supports different applications.
The universality of cloud makes the utilization rate
of resources more pronounced than any traditional
system.
1.2.5
Dynamic scalability
Cloud computing’s scalability includes horizontal and
vertical scalability. Horizontal scalability refers to
combining multiple cloud servers to form larger cloud
35

calculators for processing and storing internet data
computing.Vertical scalability refers to the cloud node
backwardly compatible and upwardly upgradable for
meeting the ever-changing markets and different client
demands.
1.2.6
An on-demand service
“The cloud” is a huge pool of resources, providing
enormous services. A user can buy it according to his
needs, just as water, electricity, and gas is charged by
the quantity consumed.
1.2.7
Very cheap cost
As to the special fault tolerant measures of “the cloud”,
it can be formed by extremely low nodes.” Enterprises
costs less to the increasingly high data centre man-
agement by the automatically centralized ‘the cloud’
management.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CLOUD
COMPUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF
UNIVERSITY INFORMATIZATION
‘The education cloud’refers to cloud computing appli-
cation in education. As a new service model, it is
welcomed. Its service development is significant for
promoting education informatization of our country in
depth, improving the level of informatization in uni-
versities, and promoting the development of Chinese
university education.
2.1
The use of cloud computing for reducing the
funds invested in software and hardware
infrastructures in universities
Cloud computing requires slow terminal equipment,
making the memory, storage and computing capacity
of a large number of distributed computers together
into a virtual pool of resources, and through the
network providing users computing services. With
the escalation of the software version, the hardware
requirements are also rising, so universities often have
to update their hardware equipment, which will lead
to funding problems and difficulties for them. In the
cloud computing environment, most tasks will be
handed over to the cloud, users need not worry about
information security, software upgrades, hardware
performance, storage and backup and other problems.
As long as there is a network and a terminal, it can be
used like water or electricity, at anytime, anywhere,
on demand, accessed for educational resources and
educational services.
2.2
The application of cloud computing realizing
the integration of university resources
There are differences in educational developments in
our country, for example, the development of north-
west education is inferior to southeast educational
development and the education fairness has always
existed. The cloud computing platform establishes a
virtual pool of resources crossing systems and regions,
being unified, safe, and strong. From different uni-
versities, teachers and students can upload or down-
load teaching resources in the resource pool, solving
the problems of the slow updating speed of school
resources and their low utilization rate.
2.3
The cloud computing provides secure and
dependable data storage centre for university
In the Internet era of wide spread viruses, the secu-
rity of data storage reliability becomes more and more
important, especially in any university lacking profes-
sional information security. If it uses cloud computing
services and storing data in the cloud, a professional
team with the professional means for measures of
safety control, the university need not worry about
virus and hardware data loss caused by damage. In
addition, the redundant storage and disaster recovery
mechanism of cloud storage services are the reliable
guarantees for data security.

THE APPLICATION OF CLOUD COMPUTING
IN UNIVERSITY INFORMATIZATION
Cloud computing, a great IT technology innovation,
leads us into a new information era – the cloud
era. It provides a new mode for the construction
and development of University informatization. It can
help solve the informatization construction problems,
such as when education information platforms can-
not meet the needs of teachers and students, when
education information and resources cannot be effec-
tively shared, because of network transmission speed,
lack of funds and data processing ability, etc. Using
the cloud computing technology, integrating isolated
islands of resources into a unified information plat-
form, it provides better services for teaching, research,
management, and the sharing of resources. We explore
the application of cloud computing for university
informatization in detail.
3.1
Constructing large-scale sharing education
resources library based on cloud computing
Teaching resources are the key to cultivating tal-
ents, and the current university education teaching
resources are unevenly distributed. These problems of
low teaching resources sharing a low degree of dupli-
cation investment to education resources and teaching
resources and high update costs, and a slow update
speed to expand the differences of teaching quality.
With cloud computing, domestic and foreign universi-
ties can build the sharing of teaching resources space,
share high quality education resources, composed of a
large number of university libraries, and then partici-
pating universities in cooperation will not only greatly
reduce their costs, but also greatly meet teacher and
student demands for resources. They access in cloud
36

whenever and wherever possible and use any client,
then, study or prepare for their works by using these
high-qualityeducationalresourcelibraries.Soweneed
to use cloud computing, establish the open sharing
of educational resources with flexible libraries. Cloud
computing will integrate, to the greatest degree, the
maximum range of higher education resources, narrow
higher education resource gap, promote quality edu-
cation resources with universal library sharing, reduce
teaching costs, improve the quality of teaching, and
improve the level of university education.
3.2
Constructing a digital library based on cloud
computing technology
As cloud computing technology becoming more
mature, the daring vanguards of science and tech-
nological progress, universities should timely apply
the cloud computing to the digital library. This will
bring new opportunities and challenges to university
libraries, as a library will no longer be in a tradi-
tional service mode, but replaced by a virtual cloud
management mode.
3.2.1
The development of service from
classification to individuation
In cloud age library services will tend to provide more
personalized service.Through the establishment of the
reader database, tracking the reader’s personal hobbies
and the characteristics of intellect, then analysing and
researching their researching and studying orientation
and characteristics, the cloud library will ultimately
provide a personalized service.
3.2.2
Changing service mode from fixed to mobile
Another development direction provides user informa-
tion access in any place, at any time and with any
different forms of information access, for example,
mobile phones, PDAs and with notebook computer
equipment, with the availability WiFi and cellular
connection service coupling.
3.2.3
The integrating of all sorts of resources in
society
The construction of digital library resources in cloud
computing should be presented in the macro national
perspective and provide the convenience of the com-
munication and integration of various information
resources. Pushed by cloud computing, a digital net-
work interconnection to all aspects of life can be
constructed, and this can achieve a shared interconnec-
tion between the economic and the cultural resources
of the whole society
3.2.4
Operating industrially
With deepening economic reforms, the university dig-
ital library industrialization has been imperative, as
the direction of the comprehensive development of
knowledge, the economy and society, as the goal of
promoting the development of the university digital
library for the information industry, of strengthening
the network systems and information construction,
and establishing a new development approach to the
university digital library.
3.3
Constructing online office cloud in a university
based on the cloud computing technology
Online office cloud is a virtual desktop solving scheme
based on cloud computing technology for any uni-
versity. A modem-size cloud computer equipment can
replace a PC and host, achieving the same operating
system with similar graphical desktop functions as a
PC, making the user feel as though he is using a PC.
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a type of cloud comput-
ing service, providing software as an online service.
Some commonly used software, such as office soft-
ware and email, can adopt cloud computing services,
using online office behind the cloud, and reduce the
maintenance investment of software upgrade.
Online office cloud based on cloud computing
technology effectively integrates the administrative
resources in university, builds the platform of infor-
mation exchanging, interacting and sharing among
various departments, internal departments, leaders,
administrative staff, teachers and students, serving
many people online at the same time, changing their
files, seeing others’ editing, and greatly improving
the cooperation efficiency, the public service, and the
service quality and efficiency of university admin-
istration, policy transparency, and administrative
efficiency.
3.4
Constructing teaching and research cloud
based on cloud computing technology
At present, university research and the experimen-
tal environment becomes more and more complex,
because of more and more information, which con-
stricts factors of capital, resources, time and system
load and others, resulting in a number of projects and
research plans failing to be implemented. Cloud com-
puting technology will help to build a university teach-
ing and research cloud environment, making these
projects and research projects be carried out smoothly.
In this regard, IBM has cooperated with six world-
wide universities, accelerating scientific research and
project implementation for these university using IBM
‘blue cloud’ solutions. IBM’s farsightedness in edu-
cational and cloud computing will give the global
educational institutions of existing IT service mode
positive, far-reaching significance.
3.5
Constructing distance education cloud
based on cloud computing technology
Distance education cloud is a cloud computing migra-
tion technology in the field of distance education, the
direction of future development in distance educa-
tion, including the required computational resources
of hardware and software in distance education.
After virtualizing these computing resources, distance
education institutions and students can rent these
37

computing resources. Distance education cloud infras-
tructure is consisting of the physical resource pool,
a basic management layer, an application interface
layer and an application layer of distance education.
The core of the distance education cloud is the dis-
tance education application layer, mainly containing:
1. operating system procedures for distance education,
teaching and management, including remote teach-
ing platforms, homework systems, office automation
systems, and educational administration management
systems; 2. distance education application procedures,
including e-mail, talk, video player, word and others;
3. long-distance education middleware, which is used
by users as most convenient for developing their own
desired distance education programs.
From the point of view of distance education insti-
tutions, its shape will be like the operation and service
centres of Google, or Amazon, simply regarded as
data centre + computing centre + interface or connec-
tor. By interface or connector, user can obtain all
distance education cloud computing resources. Dis-
tance education institutions will store all the teaching
resources in the cloud, by using them to do cloud busi-
ness; also develop application procedures to provide
service to the general user through a cloud computing
service centre, with open API and distance educa-
tion middleware. It will be the main trend of future
distance education and cloud will cooperate between
individuals or small and medium-sized institutions
of distance education and a distance education cloud
service centre.
From the perspective of students, distance educa-
tion cloud is the distance education resource centre
in Internet. Through various terminal configurations,
suchastelevision,mobilephone,PDAs,personalcom-
puters, etc, students can obtain a variety of distance
education service. For example, through the mail to
send and receive e-mail; throughTalk to communicate
with teachers and students, and through Word to write
documents as shown in Figure 1.
3.6
Establishing a home–university interaction
platform based on cloud computing
Family education is the basis of school education, the
establishment of home–university interaction platform
promoting communication between parents and teach-
ers based on cloud computing, providing convenience
for communication between home and university, and
parents having more initiative, and improving par-
ents’ participation, which are mainly illustrated in the
following three aspects.
3.6.1
Guiding parents to participate in school
management
A home–university interaction platform based on
cloud computing is not a simple electronic bulletin
board but an interactive gallery.Through this platform,
parents can intuitively understand student’s perfor-
mance in the university, and propose their suggestions
about whether the curriculum is reasonable, or whether
the student management systems accord with the age
and characteristics of students, etc. Let parents really
participate in university management and give timely
feedback for the university.
3.6.2
Promoting home–university exchanging
educational concept and experience
The most important feature of the home–university
interaction platform, based on cloud computing, is the
education concept of exchanges between home and
university. At the same time, parents can share their
educational experiences through the platform, and in
the “help” section parents can express their problems
meeting in the education process and receiving other
parents or teachers’views on this issue to help parents
avoid this predicament, and then form a good home–
university relation.
3.6.3
Providing educational services
Throughtheplatform,universityshowsuniversityedu-
cation and life education to parents, provides one-stop
education services by some successful cases of educa-
tional concepts and methods, and works together for
students’ healthy growth. Of course, there are more
cloud service tools realizing education function, such
as ‘Good-looking Book (a photograph blog record-
ing life and learning by photograph), Google forum
and so on , which fully indicates that cloud computing
application will become more prominent in education.
4
THE MAIN PROBLEMS NEEDED TO BE
WATCHED
At present, cloud computing and its application
develop swiftly and fiercely, which are still innova-
tions. There are many urgent improvements in cogni-
tion and practice, which need a clear understanding in
advance, planning ahead, and drawing on advantages
and avoiding disadvantages to play its role fully.
4.1
No cloud computing standards unified
At present, international and domestic industries have
not issued any relevant standards leading to no stan-
dards and unhealthy developments, unscaled and no
38

coordinated industrial development. It has to be said
that this is not only a pity but also an opportunity and
a challenge lost.
4.2
Core innovation technology needed
At present, there are fierce competitors in the field
of cloud computing, therefore, we must vigorously
develop the ‘Nuclear High-based’ projects (core elec-
tronic components, high-tech general chips and basis
software products) proposed by ‘Development and
Plan Outline of National Long-term Science and
Technology (2006–2020)’, vigorously promote core
cloud computing technology and independent innova-
tion products and continuously improve Chinese core
competitiveness in the field of cloud computing.
4.3
Cloud safety concerned mostly
At present, the security of cloud computing is still the
common issue of concern for industry and other users,
especially since 2007 when the SaaS service provider
— Salesforce.com – was attacked, resulting in a large
number of users’ privacy data being leaked lost. In
2010 two employees of Google intruded into Google
Voice, Gtalk and other accounts, causing privacy data
leakage; due to the lack of data encryption and dis-
persed isolated storage mechanism, database informa-
tion of 6000000 users in the CSDN website was stolen
and opened by a hacker[4].Therefore, information con-
struction based on cloud computing urgently needs to
innovate security management mechanisms, improve
security defence technology and products.
4.4
Issues of environmental protection
It should pay more attention to environmental protec-
tion issues because of the intensive, large-scale cloud
computing system. Faced with an increasingly ner-
vous energy situation, environmental protection con-
sciousness should be set up; scientific and reasonable
techniques and means should be adapted; and envi-
ronmental cloud computing digital resources should
be constructed with accompanying energy-saving and
emission reduction initiatives.
5
CONCLUSION
The rapid development of cloud computing is chang-
ing the pattern of Chinese university informatization
development. There are no revolutionary changes
about cloud competing, which is more like a devel-
opment method transferring and extending university
informatization computing platform and service to a
better cloud computing platform. Cloud computing,
a kind of development trend, will show great vitality
in the near future, injecting new impetus to univer-
sity education informatization, and contributing to the
leapfrog development of IT industry.

Research on internationalization and localization of user interface
ZhengXu Zhao, He Bai, LiLong Han & YunXiu Meng
Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China
ABSTRACT:
Multi-language software is one of the main goals of software internationalization since there are
various languages and writing types around the world.This paper introduces the concept and the main features of
software internationalization and localization via comparing and summarizing some technologies of multilingual
user interface in application software.
Keywords:
Multi-language; Internationalization; Localization; User interface
1
INTRODUCTIONS
With the deepening of the international cooperation,
exchanges between domestic and international corpo-
rations become more and more frequent. In order to
make the software enter into the international market
faster and easier, the idea of software international-
ization has been gradually put on the agenda. It has
contributed to the development of multi-language, and
people are paying more and more attention to the
development of multi-language, which has become
the mainstream of the application of international
software. There are many methods to achieve soft-
ware localization. Most of software support user to
choose multi-language interface, which can greatly
improve user satisfaction, reduce the cost of the soft-
ware, and make the products more available to the
international market[1]. The core of software inter-
nationalization lies in the information processing
of different languages. To put it simply, the mech-
anism of software internationalization can process
the text information from all over the world. Thus,
the software is not subject to any restrictions of
any types of languages. Users only need to con-
duct simple set up or modification and they can see
the user interface being displayed in their preferred
language.
The internationalization of operating system, win-
dows system, and programming library are crucial in
the design of international software, among which
the internationalization of GUI (short for Graphic
User Interface) is the key. The internationalization
of user interface not only needs to correctly show
the words in any languages, but more importantly
it also needs to cater for demands and habits of
different users. Therefore, GUI system should pos-
sess the abilities to adjust to different styles of user
interface.
2
SOFTWARE INTERNATIONALIZATION/
LOCALIZATION
Except the difference in language, countries often have
their own set of numbers, dates, currency and so on.
To meet the requirements of users from different reli-
gions and cultures, the software needs to be further
modified so that it can display and process the native
language, meanwhile supporting the different repre-
sentations. Since this kind of modification requires
the changes of a great number of source codes, it can
cost huge amounts of labor materials and financial
resources, and it will also result in problems in the
maintenance and upgrade of the software. Therefore,
based on internationalization, people have come up
with new method of software localization.
2.1
Concepts
Internationalization (I18n for short, where 18 stands
for the number of letters between the first I and last
n), is the process of designing a software application
which can potentially be adapted to various languages
and regions without any engineering changes. This
way it can be used among a great number of countries
and regions around the globe. Furthermore, soft-
ware internationalization is a method for development
without making any assumptions about the software
system, including encoding style, users’writing habit,
data display and religions, etc.
Localization (L10n for short, where 10 stands for
the number of letters between the first L and last n),
is the process of adapting internationalized software
for a specific region or language by adding localized
components and translated text. Specifically, it man-
ages to makes the software comply with the language
and writing habit of the local cultural.
41

Features required in the international software are
as follows. (1) By incorporating local information of
different countries and regions, the software can func-
tion smoothly in any part of the world. (2)Acertain text
messages, such as labels in the interface or prompts,
are kept in the external resource files rather than being
coded in the program. (3) It can support new languages
without the need for recompilation. (4) The software
allows the users to choose their preferred format for
display, including those with the local characteristics
in terms of numbers, dates, currencies, etc. (5) It can
be localized very easily.
Compared with the traditional method of software
localization, the new method based on international-
ization has many advantages[2]. (1) It originates from
one source program, which means it can be easily
maintained and modified. (2) It can largely cut back
long-term development fees, and reduce huge invest-
ments in human and material resources which are
necessary in the traditional method. (3) It enables
the company to promote the sales of the software
simultaneously in the global market.
2.2
The basic techniques
2.2.1
The expression and processing of characters
In the development stage of international software, the
character encoding is a problem that cannot avoided.
Thedifferencesinlanguagesleadtodifferentstandards
in character encoding, which presents as a challenge
for the development of international software. There-
fore, the crucial question lies in the encoding of
different characters. The idea of using one uniformed
coding system to process all the characters seems to be
a convenient and efficient method[3]. It is the discov-
ery of Unicode that makes the multi-language become
possible. Unicode has the code formats of all the char-
acters existed in the world and has 1.1 million of
code points for processing. Thus, Unicode is viewed
as a brilliant solution for processing multi-text and
multi-language.
2.2.2
Information processing relating to locale
The localization technique needs to extract part of
information from the source code so that it can pro-
cess different local expressions and grammar rules.
Each region has its own locale information. It reflects
the characteristic of localization and influences the
outcome of the program. Moreover, it uses message
catalogue to sort out hints and diagnostic informa-
tion. Message catalogue can be a file or a storage
area, which can be simply translated to the correspond-
ing language during localization, while storing hints
and the diagnostic information independent from the
program.
2.2.3
Separate binary resource file
In the development process of software, it is neces-
sary to put the localized contents in a single local-
ized resource file in order to separate the localized
source code[4]. In the development of internationalized

software based onWindows, the localized resource file
should be complied into a single DLL file, which is
called single binary resource file.
Short for Dynamic Link Library, DLL is a library
file which contains data and source code that can
be used by multiple programs. Since DLL does not
include executable code, it contributes to the sharing
of data and resource. The application of DLL solves
the problem of multi-language, reduces the difficulty
of localization, and improves the efficiency of the
development of international software.
3
TECHNIQUES SUPPORTING MULTIPLE
LANGUAGES
The following techniques are currently available for
the realization of multiple languages in international
application software.
3.1
Multiple independent applications
Each language corresponds to one application. It is
the easiest method that can thoroughly implement the
software internationalization. The downside of this
technology is that every language needs a series of
source code which may result in huge wastes in disk
space.
3.2
Integration resource of DLL
The application is compiled independently. The
language-related resources should be compiled to
DLL, and all the resources are stored in the same
DLL. When the application needs maintenance and
upgrade, one can just upgrade the program without
recompiling the DLL. However, recompilation of the
whole resource item is required when a new language
is added into the application.
3.3
Single language resource of DLL
This is an improved technique of the previous ne. The
resource files of different languages are compiled and
stored separately in every single DLL[5]. When the
program is operating, users can load the corresponding
resource DLL based on their actual demand. When
adding a new language, it is no longer necessary to

revise the entire language resources, which saves labor
and improves work efficiency thus, making up for the
deficiencies existed in the above technique.
3.4
The external language packages
The key of this technology is to write all the words,
which need to be displayed in the text files (*.ini or
*.lng being the most common). When transferring
languages, the system uses ID to read the associ-
ated contents, and then replaces the current messages.
It is easy to use and to be modified, but for those
large projects using this technology to transfer exter-
nal resource files requires adding large amount of the
code from the source text, which may lead to increased
system expenses.
A comparison of the four technologies regarding to
multi-language user interface is listed in Table 1.
The first two technologies are less commonly used
at present. The implementation of the last may have
the possibility of hindering the normal function of
the user interface. At the moment, the third technol-
ogy presents as a good solution to the international
problem. According to the different settings of users,
encapsulating resource by DLL can solve the problem
of user interface and satisfy the needs of the users.
4
SUMMARIES
From the above analysis, we can see that single
resource of DLL may be a better solution to the
implementation of multiple languages than other tech-
nologies. It is also the preferred method to the inter-
nationalization of applications. The design approach
of single resource of DLL can update the language
resource promptly. When consumers use the software,
they can choose to display the interface in the language
that they need.
With the continuous development of international
exchanges, the internationalization of application has
becomethemaintrendofthepresentsoftwaredevelop-
ment. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of interna-
tionalization and localization, and the ways of solving
the problems existed in the user interface of multi-
language. Aforementioned technologies have their
advantages and disadvantages. Thus further research
is needed to enlarge and improve the technology of
user interface of multi-language.

ABSTRACT:
From the angle of the feature level information integration, through linear weighting integration
method, this paper proposes a semi-supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm integrated with the sparsity
reconstruction feature information and pair constraint feature information and applies the genetic algorithm to
perform automatic optimization selection to the linear weighting balance parameters. Experiments show that,
when comparing the algorithm with the previous method, it has good dimensionality reduction classification
performance.
1
INTRODUCTION
The sparsity representation’s sparsity reconstruction
feature information is a kind of unsupervised infor-
mation. The Sparsity Preserving Projection (SPP) put
forward by Qiao, etc. keeps the geometrical structure
relationship in the sparsity reconstruction during the
dimensionality reduction process (Qiao, L.S., Chen,
S.C. & Tan, X.Y. 2010). However, when the super-
vision information is insufficient, SPP performance
will be easily impacted by the integrated structure of
the sample data. Therefore, Gu, etc. introduced the
category of marking supervision information through
regular methods (Gu, N. N., Fan, M.Y., Qiao H., et al.
2012) and Gui, etc. increased the constraint conditions
to introduce the largest category marking in edge crite-
ria supervision (Gui, J., Sun, Z.N., Jia, W., et al. 2012).
However, the algorithm of supervision information is
a kind of sample based on category marking.As for the
supervision of information, pair constraint includes
the similar positive constraint set and different neg-
ative constraint set to ensure that the dimensionality
reduction performance of the pair constraint feature
information–oriented Pair Constraint Guidance Fea-
ture Projection (PCFP) will be easily impacted by pair
constraint set compositions (Tang, W. & Zhong, S.
2006). It is noteworthy that, when comparing with the
category marking supervision information, the pair
constraint supervision information contains stronger
classifications, which can be obtained by sample
comparisons with even automatic operations of the
machine.
This paper proposes a semi-supervised dimension-
ality reduction algorithm, integrated with the sparsity
reconstruction feature information and pair constraint
feature information. The algorithm applies the linear
weighting mode to integrate the sparsity reconstruc-
tion feature information and pair constraint feature
information as well as applies the genetic algorithm
to complete the automatic optimization setting of the
linear weighting balance parameters of two different
types of information integration. Experiments show
that, when comparing the algorithm with the pre-
vious method, it has good dimensionality reduction
classification performance.

The paper, based on SPP and PCFP target func-
tion, proposes to apply the linear weighting mode

tion under corresponding constraint conditions of
these two types of information. Semi-supervised

Dimensionality Reduction fusing Sparsity Recon-
struction and Pairwise Constrint (SDRSRPC) target
function acquisition process is as follows:
(1) Firstly, based on SPP and PCFP target function,
we list the sparsity reconstruction feature infor-
mation, pair constraint feature information, and
corresponding projection constraint conditions.
SupposingthatthesampleX = [x1, . . . , xn] ∈Rd×n,
positive constraint set ML = {(xi, xj)|xi and xj
are the same type}, the negative constraint set
CL = {(xi, xj)|xi and xj are not the same type}, SPP
target function description is as follows (Qiao,
L.S., Chen, S.C. & Tan, X.Y. 2010):
where, S represents X ’s sparsity reconstruction
weight value matrix, X (I −S −ST + STS)X T
represents the sample X ’s sparsity reconstruction
feature information, w represents the projection
matrix W = [w1, w2, . . . , wd]’s column vector, and
the constraint conditions wTXX Tw = 1 is to avoid
degenerate solution.
The PCFP target function’s description is as
follows[4]:
represents the pair constraint feature infor-
mation, w
represents the projection matrix
W = [w1, w2, . . . , wd] the column vector, and the
constraint condition swTw = 1 is to avoid a gen-
eral solution.
(2) According to formula (1) and formula (2), these
two types of feature information are subject to the
linear weighting information integration; in addi-
tion, the linear weighting method is also applied
to integrate corresponding constraint conditions
swTXX Tw = 1 and wTw = 1 of two types of fea-
ture information. The SDRSRPC target function
proposed by the paper is:
where,w representstheprojectedvector,alldiffer-
ent projected vectors are used to form the projec-
tion matrix W = [w1, w2, . . . , wd] according to the
corresponding feature value in a reversed order.
The weighting parameter β represents the con-
tribution degree of SPP in SDRSRPC, ranging
between [0,1]. 1 −β represents the contribu-
tion degree of PCFP in SDRSRPC. If β = 0,
SDRSRPC will be reduced to PCFP; if β = 1,
SDRSRPC will be reduced to SPP.
(3) The target function (3) can be converted to the
minimization problem:
By Lagrange multiplier method, the formula (6)
can be converted to the minimum value optimiza-
tion function:
Derive w and make the derivative be 0. After
compilation, the following can be obtained
According to the corresponding feature value
λ, select the corresponding feature vector of the
feature value to compose the projection matrix
W = [w1, w2, . . . , wd].
As for the linear weighting balance parameters, dif-
ferent β values determine the specific gravity between
the sparsity reconstruction feature information and
pair constraint feature information. The following
experiment applies the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to
perform the dimensionality reduction performance
analysis and the automatic selection of the linear
weighting balance parameter, β value.

EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
Facial data are typical high-dimensional data; in the
experiment, real face database with different features
are selected as the experimental data for experiments
and for analysis of the corresponding experimental
result.
3.1
Experimental data
AR contains more than 4000 face images. Each face
group has 26 face photographs. Every group of face
pictures are taken during two periods, with an interval
of three weeks. Each period has 13 face images with
different expressions, illuminations, and cover. In the
experiments, the AR face image has been adjusted to
30 × 30 pixels. Figure 1 shows AR’s one group of face
samples.

tion and dimensionality, the reduction performance

proposed by the paper, in addition to selecting SPP
and PCFP algorithms, also selects DSPP (Gu, N. N.,
Fan, M.Y., Qiao H., et al. 2012), SSDR (Zhang, D.Q.,
Zhou, Z.H. & Chen, S.C. 2007), RLPP (Yu, G., Peng
H., Wei J., et al. 2010), NPSSDR (Wei, J. & Peng, H.
2008), semi-supervised sparsity dimensionality reduc-
tion algorithms for comparison. Table 1 shows the
specific settings of each algorithm.
Where, p represents the population size, c repre-
sents the length of the chromosome, pc represents the
crossover probability and pm represents the mutation
probability. Usually, the crossover probability pc and
the mutation probability pm are set to 0.6 and 0.1,
respectively. For convenient expression, SDRSRPC
(p,c) represents SDRSRPC with parameters p and c.
In addition, the experiment takes the recent neigh-
bouring classification algorithm as the classification
algorithm. Each group randomly selects L face images
as the training samples, the remaining ones are treated
as test samples. Take all marking samples to build the
pair constraint set. In order to verify the performance
of the algorithm, the retained feature dimensionality
shall undergo increment and calculation of the corre-
spondingaccuracyofidentificationinaccordancewith
the step length D. For each test, randomly select sam-
ples from the marking information to build the positive
constraint set and the constraint set. All experiments
will be carried out for twenty times and the average
value will be made as the experimental result.

We select SDRSRPC (5,10) as the algorithm with
parameters. The feature dimensionality increment is
done according to the step length D. Figure 2 gives
each group a training sample number L and an accu-
racy identification under the feature dimensionality

In addition, to verify the best dimensionality reduc-
tion classification performance of SDRSRPC, the
paper also lists the maximum accuracy identifica-
tion of different algorithms under different training
sample numbers L. Table 2 gives the corresponding
experimental results.

According to the above experimental results, the
following conclusions can be drawn:
(1) SDRSRPC’s discriminant classification perfor-
mance is obviously better than that of SPP and
PCFP, which shows that the linear weighting inte-
gration method is effective, and it can ensure that
SDRSRPC inherits SPP and PCFP’s respective
features.
(2) As the sparsity representation has good robust
performance andsparsityreconstructionhasgood
internal geometric feature description ability,
when comparing with SSDR, SDRSRPC has
significant performance advantages.
(3) RLPP strengthens the local manifold structure
retaining capability but RLPP ignores the inter-
nal geometry manifold structure of the initial
data. The sparsity reconstruction in SDRSRPC
has good internal geometry information. There-
fore, the SDRSRPC dimensionality reduction
classification performance is better than RLPP.
(4) The NPSSDR keeps local structure features
through regular methods. But the method for the
NPSSDR to keep local structure features is still
based on approximate nonlinearity. Therefore, in
the face image with obvious nonlinear structure
features, the NPSSDR’s performance is inferior
to that of SDRSRPC.
(5) As a semi-supervised sparsity dimensionality
reduction algorithm, DSPP also inherits the spar-
sity representation features, but the performance
of DSPP is inferior to SDRSRPC, the main cause
is that DSPP’s supervision information is based
on category marking, and its classification perfor-
manceisinferiortothepairconstraintsupervision
information.
3.3.2
Optimization performance analysis of the
linear weighting balance parameter β
To verify adaptive setting effectiveness of the balance
parameter β with GA, the paper selects some specific
retention feature dimensionality and increases the step
length of β in SDRSRPC (5, 10) to 1 from 0.05 and cal-
culates the corresponding accuracy of identification.
In addition, it also, according to different dimension-
alities, calculates the optimization weighting balance

parameter value, based on GA in SDRSRPC (5, 10).
Figure 3 shows the specific experimental result.
The analysis on above experimental results shows
that:
(1) When the retained feature dimensionality is
higher than a certain threshold value, the linear
weighting balance parameter β’s impact on the
accuracy of identification of SDRSRPC (5, 10) is
almost the same, which shows that the selection of
the linear weighting balance parameter, β based
on GA, has high stability.
(2) β is in the [0,1] section, which increases with the
step length of 0.05 and calculates the correspond-
ing accuracy identification of SDRSRPC (5,10).
The calculation method of the linear weighting
balance parameter β needs 21 times and the
optimization value will be selected. However,
SDRSRPC (5,10) only calculates 3 algebra indi-
viduals for 15 times. Accordingly, if applying GA
to calculate the linear weighting balance of the
parameter β value, the searching time will be
shorter.
(3) The linear weighting balance parameter β, calcu-
lated by SDRSRPC (5,10), and the optimization
48

linear weighting balance parameter β, obtained by
[0,1] section traversal, are almost the same, which
shows that the automatic setting method of the lin-
ear weighting balance parameter β by the genetic
algorithm perfect form (3) is effective.

CONCLUSIONS
The paper proposes a semi-supervised dimensional-
ity reduction algorithm, integrated with the sparsity
reconstruction feature information and pair constraint
feature information. The algorithm applies the lin-
ear weighting method to integrate with the sparsity
reconstruction feature information and pair constraint
feature information, as well as applying the genetic
algorithm to complete the automatic optimization set-
ting of linear weighting balance parameters of two
different types of information integration. The algo-
rithm effectively solves the insufficiently supervised
information and the failure of the automatic parame-
ter setting in the existing sparsity representation of the
semi-supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm.
The experimental result shows that, when compared
with the recent relevant semi-supervised algorithm,
SDRSRPC has a better dimensionality reduction clas-
sification performance.

INTRODUCTION
On the TOP500 list published in Jun 2014, the TH-2
super computer, developed independently in our coun-
try, is the fastest computer in the world due to its 33.86
PFLOPS (Peta Floating Point Operations Per Sec-
ond) operation performance, while the earliest ENIAC
operation speed is only 5000 times/s. With the rapid
improvement in computing power, the performance
improvement of the storage system cannot meet the
demand of the rapidly-growing computing power so
thatmismatching of computingperformancewithstor-
age performance has limited the overall performance
of high-performance computers.
As a branch of computer science, currently, the
high-performance computer is standing on a rapid
development stage and has a very important position
in scientific research and technological service. Tak-
ing the National Super Computer Center in Tianjin
for example, the application range of the super com-
puter TH-1Ausedinthecentrecoveredoilexploration,
biological medicine, cartoon rendering, and design
simulation, etc., in multiple fields besides scientific
calculations. It has been widely used for administrative
informationization, smart city and intelligent traffic
etc. The TH-1A super computer has been in service
for nearly four years in the Center in Tianjin. Through
a period of operation, it shows that the system has a
reasonable design, good integrated performance, and
a stable and reliable system, and has successfully fin-
ished many large-scale, complicated calculation tasks.
The TH-1A is provided with a Lustre file system as
its storage system i.e. the system structure of calcula-
tionseparatedfromstorage.Inthepracticalapplication
for such as I/O, huge and intensive application for oil
exploration data processing etc, the Lustre system for
this structure shows some inadaptability, which has
limited full play in the overall performance of this
computer.
Owing to the inadaptability of the storage system
for the specific application and research demands in a
new storage hierarchy for the next generation of high-
performance computers, as shown in the aboveTH-1A
operation,itisnecessarytosimulatethestoragesystem
needed before the scheme is determined. Simulating
the storage system is an efficient path to evaluate the
storage system’s performance during its design and to
obtain a storage system design. At the same time, dur-
ing the research for a new computer system structure,
especially for a new storage system structure, the stor-
age system simulator becomes the best tool to explore
and research the new storage system structure because
its performance cannot be verified on the existing sys-
tem.This paper presented the storage system simulator
LustreSim based on the Lustre storage system.

DESIGN AND REALIZATION OF
LUSTRESIM
2.1
Overview of Lustre file system
Lustre is an object-oriented file system and is widely
used for large-scale high-performance computing
cluster system, provided with the super computer
which its computing subsystem has separated from
its storage subsystem. Figure 1 shows the system’s
structural diagram of Lustre. It consists of three com-
ponents: Metadata Servers (MDS), Object Storage
Servers (OSS) and Client. MDS mainly provides meta-
data service for the namespace administration of the
overall file system to save and maintain the file distri-
bution layout attribution, which contains data object
index information. MDShas is a Metadata Target
Device (MDT), used to save metadata objects such
as file names, directory structures and access rights
etc. OSS is used to lead out the block device and pro-
vide file I/O service. Each OSS is used to manage
one or more Object Storage Target (OST) devices.
51

Figure 1.
Structure of Lustre file system.
OST is used to save file data objects. The file data
can be stripped to multiple objects located on OSTs to
provide rapid concurrent read/write performance. The
client realized interface of POSIX file system, such as
open(), read() and write() etc, can access file service
through a shared high-performance network. Gener-
ally, for the high-performance computing field, the
client, MDS and OSS are connected mutually through
a high speed network, such as InifiniBand. Lustre is
provided with an Out of Band system to separate the
control path from the data path. The client can directly
set up data path to rapidly obtain data with OSTs after
obtaining file metadata.
The operation process of the high-performance
computer is as follows: when submitting parallel
computation, the operator shall submit the opera-
tion description script. In the operation description
script, the operator must appoint the relationship
between the applied computing node and the data to
be transmitted, and which files shall be transmitted
to which node’s local storage. The job dispatcher of
the high-performance computer system can start data
transmission when allocating computing resources for
the parallel computation, and start computation after
the data transmission is finished. During computation,
the parallel program can guide its processes to write
back the final result into the backend storage.
Figure 2 shows the I/O process of Lustre at the stor-
age end. When the client accesses one file, he shall
firstly send the file access request to MDS through
MDC. MDS will inquire about the inode information
of the file requested on MDT and return the layout
information back to client. The data distribution infor-
mation of the file is stored in the inode. Each object
contains a part of the data of the file, which is stored on
OSTs.After receiving the stripped information, Client
can set up the data path for an I/O operation with OSCs
and OSTs.
2.2
Selection of drive mode
Currently, the method to simulate the system struc-
ture mainly includes trace-driven and execution-driven
drives.
Figure 2.
File access process in Lustre.
Trace-driven simulating is to use the trace of a
process to drive the simulation. Firstly, the trace is
obtained through the executed program in the real
system. This real system must have a similar struc-
ture to the target device. After that, the trace is used
as the input to run the simulator. Trace-driven simu-
lating is roughly divided into three stages: recording
traces from the program, trace selection, and tar-
getedmachinesimulation.Trace-drivensimulatinghas
longer appearing time and is widely used in simulator
research in the storage field.
Execution-driven simulating is used to combine
program execution with target system simulation.
Generally, it is a competitive process of multiple pro-
cesses for the processor: Firstly, when the process is
switched on, the process needs another processor to
continue its work. Secondly, if the process switching
among the processors does not occur, the current pro-
cessor will execute the basic block in the program and
promote the system clock. The repeated execution of
the above two steps will promote the overall simulating
process until each process is ended or the simulation
has finished. Currently, execution-driven simulation is
more used for the development of parallel compilers
and an analysis of the application’s performance.
Owing to the congenital advantage of the trace-
driven selection on the storage system simulation,
LustreSim uses trace-driven to set up the simulator,
and uses a simplified set of I/O traces from the actual
system for an input so that all the clients can compet-
itively use storage nodes in the Lustre file system to
obtain the results of the execution.
2.3
Design of LustreSim system structure
LustreSim, corresponding to the Lustre file system,
consists of three modules: Client module, Metadata
Server Module (MDS) and file data server module
OSS.Clientmoduleisresponsibleforthegenerationof
I/O requests, the promotion of a simulation clock, and
interaction with the MDS and OSS buffer zones. MDS
is mainly used to provide metadata service and return
OST layout information. OSS is used to manage OST
and provide I/O services. OST can provide different
transmission bandwidths according to different RAID
configurations.
52

LustreSim system structure.
In order to study the I/O performance of the Lustre
file system better, and discover the system’s bottle-
necks, LustreSim should have the following features:
1. For each I/O request, the time which it takes to pass
through each of the system’s components and the
delay in response can be logged.
2. The input of the simulator can be obtained not only
from the real trace, but also from a random gener-
ator according to any given I/O characteristics.
3. Itcanrealizeconfigurabilityofthescaleandperfor-
mance on client number, OST number, and stripped
strategy, and a MDS’s processing capacity, etc.
2.4
Specific realization of LustreSim
According to the module division of LustreSim, we
use object-oriented methods to realize LustreSim.
During actual realization, if thousands of clients are
configured with multithreads to realize parallel gen-
eration requested by the I/O may cause large time and
space overheads, these overheads will greatly increase
the actual operation time when the simulator execut-
ing the simulation process.Therefore, we want to use a
single thread with multilevel lists to realize concurrent
generations of multiple client I/O requests. Client can
take each I/O request as one Event. Cid in Event shows
the Client generating the request. The Event with the
same Cid is saved in the same line in the multilevel
linked list, constituting one request list, from the actual
client (see Figure 4). Each line of the multilevel list is
saved with all the I/O requests from one actual client.
At the beginning of the simulation, the first event on
each line of the multilevel list is sent to an MDS buffer.
When the client thread receives a completion message
of the event each time, it can send the next event on the
Figure 4.
Multilevel list of client requests.
list to the MDS buffer and release the corresponding
item on the list where the event is located. When all
the request chains are empty, the simulator ends.
MDS
Generally, the actual Lustre file system is provided
with two MDSs to provide service and data backup
(active/standby). Therefore, during realization, the
processing module for MDS metadata request only
needs one thread. When the MDS processing mod-
ule is empty in the MDS buffer, we took out the first
event from the queue in the buffer and inquired about
the metadata information of the event, then we filled
its layout information to finish the metadata inquiring
operation. During the actual operation of Lustre, after
the client received the metadata information, it will
start to set up the path for data transmission with the
corresponding OSTs. The main time overhead affect-
ing this process is the delayed time for the request
from the queuing at the OSTs end. Therefore, in the
model, the process can be simplified as MDS directly
sends I/O request to the corresponding OSTs after the
metadata information has been obtained.
The Metadata of Lustre is saved in the MDT in the
form of an inode. It is possible to obtain the file layout
information by asking the inode of the corresponding
file through FileName. In our realization, metadata
information of the file is saved in a HashTable. The
FileID is used as the key, and the other parts are saved
in HashTable, the file layout information.At the begin-
ning, HashTable is empty. When a request appears, if
HashTable is missed, we fill the table and return the
metadata information according to stripe count and
current unoccupied OST (feedback by OSS).
OSS
Corresponding to Client realization, it is unnecessary
to allocate one thread for each OST that the realization
is rather complicated. By referring to realization of the
multilevel list, as well, a multilevel list can be designed
for OST. Each line of the multilevel list saves all the
requests that refer to its corresponding OST. The I/O
bandwidth of OST is related to the configuration of
RAID array. I/O bandwidth provided by RAID array
can be obtained by testing the mathematical modelling
or the actual system.

THE LUSTRESIM TEST
In order to verify the validity of LustreSim, we per-
formed a series of experiments based on the simulator
and compared it with the testing data of the real
TH-1A system. TH-1A uses Lustre as its I/O subsys-
tem, and is provided with total four Lustre file systems.
We use the largest file system for testing. The parame-
ters for test case include 64 OSTs, 512, 1024 and 2048
cores (12 cores per node) for IOR FPP (File Per Proces-
sor).The I/O request block size is 1M.The aggregation
file size is 512G, 1024G and 2048G respectively. The
simulator is provided with same system conditions.
Figure 6 shows the comparison of the performance
testing data between them both. The result shows
that the actual system of write performance is obvi-
ously better than the simulator, which is because the
TH-1A is provided with a Seagate enterprise-level
SATA II hard disk, which has a large disk buffer. For
the write operation, the actual system would be taken
as finished when written to the disk buffer but the sim-
ulator does not realize the buffer hierarchy. However,
if the data block is increased to or higher than the disk
buffer size, the disk’s write speed would be close to
the read speed, which is dependent on the magnetic
density and rotation speed of the disk. For the parallel
read performance, the simulator shows little difference
from the actual system, which proves the validity of
the simulator.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The storage system simulator is a very important tool
during the design of the computer system or research
into the new storage system. LustreSim is designed
on the basis of a deep analysis of the Lustre system.
It can be used with relative accuracy to evaluate the
storage performance of a high-performance computer
provided with Lustre as an input/output system when
facing applications with different I/O characteristics.
In the future, according to the different require-
ments for the storage system facing different appli-
cations, the hierarchical storage system equipped by
high-performance computation will be sure to become
the vital research issue. Therefore, the future objec-
tive direction for LustreSim should be to develop
an intermediate storage level based on LustreSim,
which can simulate different storage mediums (such
as SSD) through different performance parameters
and configurations. In this way we can evaluate the
impacts brought by the intermediate storage. Then
we can provide a reference for the next generation of
high-performance computer storage subsystems.

the stone influence function

ABSTRACT:
Quantization of strong groups in the Go game is critical for both professional players and Go
programs. In this paper, we define a stone influence function named Strength, based on which a strong group
quantization model named Filtration is established, and the model parameter is further optimized by multi-level
species compete-die out algorithm. Through this approach various strong group quantization models based on
different levels can be obtained. The results of the test show that compared with the original model, Filtration’s
accuracy and speed of operation are promoted by 51.7% and 48.4% respectively, which is precise enough to do
positional analysis in the real time Go programs. Moreover, this model can be applied in researches on computer
games, artificial intelligence and game software.

INTRODUCTION
Go, known as the art of imaginative and logical think-
ing, is now regarded as one of the most difficult
challenges for artificial intelligence[1]. The exhaus-
tive research applied in the chess-playing program can
hardly work here due to the vast search space in the Go
game[2]. Presently, the strongest Go-playing program
boasts a level of amateur 6 dan, which a human player
can reach when learning for more than three years[3].
Hence, the heuristic search algorithm designed by
referring to the thinking method of a human player is a
workable approach to improve the level of a computer
program[4].
Go researchers generally consider that the calcula-
tion of strong group value plays an important role in
computer Go, the accuracy of which directly influ-
ences the final evaluation results especially during
static evaluation. However, research on the calculation
of strong group values makes slow progress because
of the great difficulty in quantizing strong group val-
ues. Abe Yoshiteru presented a method, based on the
stone quantity of a strong group, to quantize a strong
group value in 1990s[5]. However, it had an extremely
low accuracy which made it impossible to be applied
in the computer Go programs. Whereas some famous
Go programs such as MoGo[6], Crazy Stone[7], and
GNUGO[8], etc., even define the quality of strong
groups. The algorithm used to quantize a strong
group value made its debut in a winning probability
program – Winnable, which firstly adopted a quan-
tification method to calculate strong group value and
has gained good operational results[9]. Nevertheless,
Fence, the strong group value quantization model in
Winnable calculates with a relatively low speed and
accuracy, because of its direct adoption of the stone
influenced function of GNUGO, and the model was
limited to only one certain Go level by the fixed
parameters.
This paper presents a new method of strong group
influence value quantification as follows: take the
influence of the strong group as the diffusion of control
probability in the two-dimensional space, therefore the
stronggroup’svalueiscalculatedasthesumofthecon-
trol probability. Meanwhile, the Multi-Level Species
Compete Die out (MLSCD) algorithm is used to opti-
mize the model’s parameter and adjust the judgments
according to different Go levels. Based on the levels
of the players, the model finally optimizes the strong
group quantification model parameter of professional
and1danlevel,whichprovestheaccuracyandadvance
of the model. With the application of the method, the
program can calculate the strong group value in the
start game and middle game, so that the situation can
be more accurately evaluated.

STRONG GROUP QUANTIZATION
ALGORITHM
2.1
Idea of quantization
A chain of stones that has great influence in a broad
area is referred as ‘strong group’. Researchers of com-
puter Go consider that a computable model should be
defined so as to quantize and evaluate the influence of
55

Figure 1.
An example of territory and strong group.
the stones[10]. The traditional method of quantization
assesses the group’s value as the sum of the points it
controls, which works well in quantizing territories.As
Figure 1 shows, the white’s territory marked triangle
and square which cannot be invaded holds the value of
9 points considering two captured stones in the square
marked area.
However, due to the potential influence of the strong
group, the method of calculating the controlled points
can hardly work here.As Figure 1 shows, though points
C, D, E, F are greatly influenced by black, none will be
captured if white occupies any of them, so they cannot
be counted as black’s territory.As a result, according to
the traditional method, the strong group’s value cannot
be defined except by the two points marked A and B.
On the contrary, however, the black group holds a value
of 20 points[11].
Therefore, a new method of quantizing strong
group’s value is presented as follows: as strong groups
have an influence over the vast space around them and
the influence value of every unoccupied point varies
from shapes and distances, we use probability to repre-
sent potential influence. Suppose black has a potential
influence of x% over one certain point, which means
the point has a x% probability to be black’s one point,
ie black has a value of x% point on this point.
Strong group’s value can be taken as the diffusion
of control probability in the two-dimensional space.
We only need to obtain the strong group’s value by
adding up the influence probability of the unoccupied
points around the strong group instead of calculating
the points totally controlled by the strong group which
is actually impossible to count.
2.2
Stone’s influence function
When assessing the value of strong groups, proper
influence function is required to quantize the influ-
ence of every move. The earliest influence function
was proposed by Dr. Zobrist in his dissertation[12],
and then various influence functions were successively
established by Dr. Ryder[13] and Professor K. Chen[14].
However, these functions can merely be applied in con-
firming territories, dividing blocks and analysing the
strength of groups.
To promote the accuracy and speed of the strong
group’s value quantization model, a stone’s influence
function needs to be established to meet the special
requirements of the strong group value quantization.
According to the characteristic of the strong group
and the results of the tests, it is concluded that
stone’s influence function should meet the following
requirements:
(1) The influence value should be increased when the
point gets closer to the stone.
(2) The degree of decay should get deeper when the
point departs from the stone.
(3) The maximum influence distance of five gener-
ates the best effect according to the professional
players’ experience.
(4) The structure of the function should be concise
and all procedures that may increase the calcula-
tion time should be reduced or revised in order to
promote the speed.
According to the requirements above, the influence
function Strength is established under the following
rules:
(1) Given (0, 0) is the coordinates of the influence
source and the strength is S(0, 0), the influence of
the points on either x-axis and y-axis in the first
quadrant would be:
(2) The influence of the points on the angular bisector
of the first quadrant would be:
(3) The influence of the other points in the first
quadrant would be:
(4) Take y-axis as the axis of symmetry, the points in
the second quadrant would be:
(5) Take x-axis as the axis of symmetry, the points in
the third and the fourth quadrant would be:
According to the rules above, the results would be
as follows: Given S(0, 0) = 210, the influence zone
formed by the independent influence source is shown
in Figure 2, in which the numbers are actually floating
point numbers rounded off for convenience.
2.3
Quantization algorithm
Based on the stones’ influence function above,
this paper establishes a new strong group value
quantization model named Filtration and works out

Itol which represents the sum of group influence value
as follows:
(1) The black stones’ influence value is a positive
number while the white stones’ is a negative
number.
(2) Calculate the number of effective stones n: The
stone with a number of liberty equal to or more
than 3 is defined as an effective stone, to calcu-
late its number.As Figure 1 shows, the black stone
marked G has only 2 liberties, so it is not an effec-
tive stone.The black strong group’s effective stone
number n = 6.
(3) Calculate the threshold value: Vt1: Vt1 = α ∗n and
Vt2: Vt2 = β ∗n
(4) Calculate normalize parameter N: N = γ ∗n
(5) Empty point adjust: If there are at least one black
stone and one white stone beside an empty point,
the empty point’s influence value is 0.

(8) Threshold value adjust: The larger the influence
value, the more probability the empty point would
be one point. However, no matter how large the
influence value is, it is, at most, one point. For this
reason, when I ∗∗

≥Vt1, define Ii = 1. The points
of which the influence value is the lesser, although
it has an influence value, could not be conditioned
by black in fact.Therefore, when I∗∗

Ii is the value of the strong group.
The strong group is closely related with the player’s
Go level, so it is highly subjective. Therefore, when
setting the parameters, it is necessary to optimize the
model parameters according to different Go levels.
Optimization means to find the best or quasi-
optimal solution amongst lots of possible solutions to
a problem. To optimize the parameters in the strong
group quantization model means to form a combina-
tion of parameters, based on different Go levels, in
order to assess the value of a strong group more accu-
rately, so that the weight of the attacking or defensive
moves can be adjusted and thus the best move can
finally be determined upon.

OPTIMIZATION
3.1
Genetic algorithm
A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is adopted to optimize
the parameters. GA is a computation module which
simulates Darwinian’s genetic selection and natural
elimination in the process of creature evolution. The
method is proved effective in resolving the opti-
mization problem through the simulation of natural
evolution. It was first proposed by Prof. J. Holland of
Michigan University in 1975 and has now been widely
used in the domain of artificial intelligence, machine
learning, etc.[15].
3.2
Fitness function and coding scheme
The model is simplified as: y = f (X , ψ). in which X
is an argument and ψ represents the 5 parameters to
be optimized. Least square method is usually adopted
to define the object function of parameter optimiza-
tion. Given the empirical data {(xi, yi)|i = 1, 2, . . . , n},
in order to optimize parameters, the parameter com-
bination ψ should be obtained so as to minimize the
function: S(ψ) = n
i=1 [yi −f (xi, ψ)]2.
There are 90 Joseki in[16], which represent one get
territory and the other get strong group. First of all,
a professional player is invited to judge the value of
a strong group. Professional players present the high-
est Go levels, so the model of professional level could
verify the correction and compare with the model of
Winnable. Meanwhile, the worldwide top Go program
is 2 kyu or so, and it is assumed that the Go program
level equivalent of 1 dan will come out in two years.
Therefore,wehaveprospectivelyoptimizedtheparam-
eters of a strong group quantization model based on the
1 dan level.Then 60 joseki are selected at random, used
for optimizing parameters. Finally, a contrast test is
made between the optimized professional-level model
and the model in Winnable, in which 30 joseki are
selected.
It can be inferred that the strong group quantization
of optimized model can be represented by (6),
In which ψ represents the five parameters which need
preparative optimization. After that, it is defined that
the objective function of GA is (7).
57

In the research of this paper, the constant C = 600.
The results of strong group quantization, calculated
by the optimized model, are expected to be as close to
the human players’judgments as possible, ie the larger
F(ψ) the better.
We adopt floating encoding in the coding scheme of
this algorithm, for it is in correspondence with the vari-
ables and parameters of optimization problems, with
high calculation accuracy and good convenience in
realizing this algorithm. Since the winning probability
model includes 5 parameters, the coding length of this
algorithm l = 5. The value range of every gene in the
coding string is determined by the Go characteristics
of its corresponding parameters.
3.3
Multi-level Species Compete-Die out algorithm
model & optimized results
To resolve the combinatorial optimization of con-
trol parameters and the genetic operator in GA, we
introduced a multi-level species compete-die out algo-
rithms model.
Species Compete-Die out (SCD) algorithm is a kind
of genetic algorithm based on a niche evolutionary
method and hierarchical fair competitions principles.
It fully adopts the evolution phenomenon of the natural
and the human society as well as the ideology ‘survival
of the fittest’. In terms of the initial fitness value,
the niche evolution of initial species can be divided
into groups. This SCD algorithm has been applied
well in the parameter optimization of the growth
models of cucumbers in greenhouses[17]. The Multi-
Level Species Compete-Die out (MLSCD) algorithm
model is based on the original SCD model, which
has introduced the secondary GA; the primary and
the secondary GA are embed with each other to real-
ize parameter optimization of the winning probability
model. Primary GA is applied to realize the parameter
optimization of the winning probability model. SCD
model is still used as the model frame for this algo-
rithm, then the control parameters of the primary GA
in the inner of species and between the species can
be distinguished, and so can the genetic parameters;
the execution strategy of the algorithm is determined
by the secondary GA; the secondary GA is used for
the realization of the combinatorial optimization of
the control parameters and the genetic operators in the
primary GA.
The MLSCD algorithms model can obtain better
search results compared with the general GA model.
The nested relational operation of the two-level GA
model makes the iterative calculation increased by tens
of times that lead to the rise in operational cost[18].
However, it is reasonably acceptable, for there is no
real-time request.
The results of optimized parameters, shown in
Tables 1 and 2, can be used for the program’s instruc-
tion to calculate the value of a strong group.
The model of strong group quantization would fin-
ish after parameter optimization. Figures 3–5 are used
as a reference for the convenience of description.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We have used Intel Core 2 Duo CPU 3.0 GHz/4 GB
RAM, and 30 joseki as experimental tests.
A professional player is invited to judge the value of
the strong group, used as theory (Va). Then, the model
is put into operation, and an experimental value (Vb)
is obtained. According to (8) to (10), the parameters
can be computed. The experimental results are shown
in the Table 3 and Figure 6.

It can be inferred fromTable 3 that the relative error
of filtration pro model is small compared with fil-
tration ama1 model. The main reason is professional
player’s ability to make correct judgments; while 1 dan
amateur makes unstable judgments, so Va can be inac-
curate, and thus influences the final result. In order
to offset the fluctuation, we can get the average value
from the judgments of several 1 dan amateurs.

CONCLUSION
Unlike the territories, the strong groups’ value can
hardly be assessed by calculating every single point.
Therefore, a quantization method is proposed with the
introduction of probability and the establishment of
the stone’s influence function named Strength. Due to
its high accuracy and speed, Filtration can be applied
in the beginning game and middle game modules
and assist the program to conduct positional analysis.
When the level of the Go program varies, the param-
eters in the model can be adjusted correspondingly.
Therefore, this model can be applied to all Go levels
because of its good transportability and universality.
The introduction of probability theory makes it pos-
sible to substantiate the vague concepts and conduct
a quantitive analysis, so that the dimensionality of the
game is broadened. This approach can also be used to
solve other computer game problems.

ABSTRACT:
This paper studies a novel scheme of watermarking relational databases for copyright protection
based on genetic algorithms. In this algorithm, a GA is used in a watermark signal processes, and associated
novel watermark insertion algorithms and detection algorithms are proposed. Thus, the watermark signal in this
method is expected to be more meaningful and has closer correlative relationship to the copyright holder. The
experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is feasible, effective, and robust.

INTRODUCTION
Relational database watermarking protects the intel-
lectual property in today’s internet-based application
environments and in many content distribution appli-
cations. We present a mechanism for proof of own-
ership based on the secure embedding of a robust
imperceptible optimization watermark in relational
database. Based on the rational database watermark,
researches in database watermarks are being con-
ducted by people such as R. Agrawal and R. Sion.
Including previous research into watermarking, they
pay attention to arithmetic embedding and extracting.
A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search technique
that is based on the principles of natural selection or
survival of the fittest. Genetic algorithms are one of
the best ways to solve a problem about which little is
known objectively and functions directly in the search.
Then, by using evolving operations such as crossover,
mutation, and selection, the GA creates successive
generationsofsolutionsthatevolveandinheritthepos-
itive characteristics of their parents and thus gradually
approach optimal or near-optimal solutions. By using
the objective function directly in the search, GA’s can
be effectively applied in nonconvex, highly nonlinear,
and complex problems.
The main contributions to this work include: pre-
senting an effective GA technique to generate water-
mark signal; and present a new technique to insert
and detect watermarks using a mark bit position,
together with a decision-making algorithm by pattern
matching. In order to improve robustness, the scheme
embeds a watermark into the database for several times
and recovers the detected watermark by a majority
voting mechanism.

ALGORITHMS FOR WATERMARKING
RELATIONAL DATABASES
In this section, the watermark embedding and extrac-
tion algorithms are presented. We assume that some
minor changes of some attributes values can be toler-
ated. And we will embed copyright information into
these attributes. We consider the character copyright
informationasasequenceof0and1,themarksof0and
1 are small errors in the relational data. All the marks
of 0 and 1 represent integrated copyright information.
The problem of watermarking relational databases can
be modelled as follows.
Suppose relation R contains a primary key P and
numerical attributes A0, A1,…, Av-1. Assume that it
is acceptable to change one of ξ Least Significant
Bits (LSB). Copyright information which will con-
vert as a sequence of 0 and 1 is to be embedded into
relation R for the purpose of copyright protection.
Table 1 summarizes the important parameters used in
our algorithms.
Our technique aims to mark only numeric attributes.
The data owner is responsible for deciding which
attributes are suitable for marking. He also helps
to decide two important parameters ξ and γ, which
describe the limits of modification to a database. We
also suppose the adversary should not remove or mod-
ify the primary key attributes for the integrity and
availability of the database. An attacker cannot guess

all of these for the secret key and other parameters are
private to the owner.
2.1
Watermark generation algorithm
Figure 1 shows the watermark generation algorithm. It
can be express as W = G (m, Ks). W included a secret
key Ks only known to the copyright owner and identity
information “m”.
The detailed process of watermark generation algo-
rithm by using GA is as follows:
Step 1. Encoding. Encoding of chromosomes is one
oftheproblems,whenyouarestartingtosolveproblem
with GA. Encoding very much depends on the prob-
lem.Traditionally, solutions are represented in binary
as strings of 0s and 1s.
The original copyright information, identity infor-
mation and confidential information or other relevant
information ‘m’, is converted into binary code, using
function “dec2bin ()” to obtain binary code. In binary
encoding every chromosome is a string of bits, 0 or 1.
Table 2 shows the 0 generation.
Step 2: Selection, recombination, and mutation. We
formed binary code in Step 1, using a binary string of
symbols to express each individual.
(1) During each successive generation, a propor-
tion of the existing population is selected to breed
a new generation. Individual solutions are selected
through a fitness-based process, where fitter solutions
(as measured by a fitness function) are typically more
likely to be selected. Certain selection methods rate

the fitness of each solution and preferentially select
the best solutions. Other methods rate only a random
sample of the population, as this process may be very
time-consuming. Normally can be used ‘selection ()’
function to achieve the process of selection:
function[evol_gen,bes_ind,max_fitness]=
selection(old_gen, fitness) [min_fitn,expo(b)]=
min(fitn);
[max_fitn, expo (a)]=max_ (fitn);
Popusize=length (fitness);
bes_ind=old_gen (expo (a), :);
expo=[1:popusize];expo(expo(a))=0;
expo(expo(b))=0;
expo=nonzeros (expo);
evol_gen=old_gen (expo, :);
evol_fitness=fitness (expo, :);
evol_popusize=popusize- 2;
posel=evol_fitness/sum (evol_fitness);
poselcum=cusum (posel);
r=rand (1, evol_popusize);
selected=1+sum(poselcum*ones(1,evol_popusize)
<ones (evol_ popusize, 1)*r);
evol_gen=evol_gen (selection, :);
(2) The next step is to generate a second generation
population of solutions from those selected through
genetic operators: crossover (recombination), and/or
mutation. For each new solution to be produced, a
pair of ‘parent’solutions is selected for breeding from
the pool selected previously. By producing a ‘child’
solution using the above methods of crossover and
mutation, a new solution is created which typically
shares many of the characteristics of its ‘parents’. Nor-
mally ‘recombination ()’ and ‘mutation ()’functions
can be used to achieve the process of recombination:
function [new_gen] = recombination (old_gen, pc)
[nouse, match]=sort (rand (size (old_gen, 1), 1));
match_gen=old_gen (match, :);
pairs=size (match- gen, 1)/2;
bit_n=size (match_gene, 2);
string=rand (pairs, 1) <pc;
crossp=randint (string, 1, [1, bit_n]);
crossp=string.*crossp;
for i=1: pairs
new_gen ([2* i- 1 2* i], : )= [match_gen ([2* i- 1
2*i],
1: crossp (i)) match_gen ([2* i 2* i - 1], crossp (i)
+1:bin_n)];

mpoints=find (rand (size (old_gen)) <pm);

Step 3: To generate watermark W. After selection,
crossover and mutation the watermark signal was cre-
ated. Assuming bits of watermark signal is Wk∈{0,
1}, k = 1, 2…, k, decided by capability and intensity
of database. Figure 2 shows the process of watermark
anagenesis sketch map.
2.2
Embedding algorithm
We use a one-way hash function result, decided by the
primary key P and the secret key Ks, to choose where
to mark and what to mark. Usually it has the form
of h = H (M), where M is the seed. Besides, It bears
the following characteristics: given M, it is easy to
compute h; yet when given h, it is hard to compute M,
such that H (M) = h; given M, it is hard to find another
message M0 such that H (M) = H (M0). Several hash
functions, such as MD5 and SHA, are good choices
for this purpose.
Step 1. We transform a meaningful watermark W
into a bit flow E (EMC, Encrypted Mark Code) of
certain length.
Step 2. We decide which tuple (attribute and bit)
should be marked by the hash value. The remainder
of h module L (Ks = h mod L) decides which bit of
the EMC is used at one time. Since the hash result is
expected to be uniform distributed, we can divide the
relationintogroupsofvariedbutsimilarsizes.Thuswe
have L (the number of bits of the watermark) groups.
The i-th bit of the watermark will be inserted into the
i-th group. The ascending order of I ranging from 0
to L-1 naturally preserves the sequence of the marks.
This is helpful in the detection phase.
Step 3. We use id (id = Hash (Ks, P, Ks)) and L
(the number of bits of the watermark) to calculate the
remainder I for each tuple, and then collect tuples with
same values of I into the same group. The i-th bit of
the watermark will be inserted into the i-th group. The
ascending order of I ranging from 0 to L-1 naturally
preserves the sequence of the marks. This is helpful in
the detection phase.
Algorithm: watermark embedding algorithm
Input: parameters Ks, L, γ, and ν
Output: marked R

5) attribute_ index I = t mod ν // mark attribute Ai
6) bit_index j = t mod ξ // mark j th bit
7) watermark_index Ks = t mod L //use the k-th bit

8) mark_bit m=Ek XOR (Ks mod 2) // get the value
of marked bit
9) set the j-th least significant bit of r.Ai to m
10) if (not within_usability(new_data)) // check the
availability
11) rollback
12) return R
2.3
Watermark extraction algorithm
If the owner of the dataset suspects that some datasets
are illegal copied or tampered from his relational
database R, he or the third party can use watermark
extraction algorithm to verify the ownership of the
suspicious dataset. Now we introduce our watermark
extraction.
Because of the identical distribution of the hash
function when seeded by the same key, the selected
tuples in each group is of the same order as in the
insertion algorithm .For each marked bit, we count the
numbers of its value to be zeroes or ones respectively,
and then a majority voting mechanism is to decide the
final value of this bit. The detected result is a binary
sequence which includes the copyright information of
the dataset. The copyright holder can make use of the
watermark signal to prove the copyright.
Step 1. Majority-voting mechanism is used to find
effective bits in databases with keys. So a watermark
code will be obtained again as an opposite way of
insetting.
Step 2. After values of index by inverse process of
watermark generation.
Step 3. The copyright holder can make use of
the meaning and features of the signal to prove the
copyright.

EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS
We perform experiments on a computer running
Windows XP Professional with 2.4 GHz CPU and
25 MB RAM. Watermark generation algorithm of
Matlab has been given. Algorithms are implemented
on Java Eclipse Platform Version 3.0 using JDBC to
visit Microsoft Office Access 2003. We select before
50,000 tuples as a database. We choose MD5 as the
one-way hash function and the significance level is
0.01.
The testing results of the various attacks on a rela-
tional database and the necessary analysis were given
by the following.
3.1
Deletion attack
The attacker attempts to destroy the tuples from the
watermarked data set. Furthermore, in this test we
compare our implementation with the old watermark
approach. Figure 3 shows the experimental results,
where it clearly show that our watermarking technique
is resilient to the random deletion attack. Using our
technique the watermark was successfully extracted
with 100% accuracy even when over 40% of the tuples
were deleted.
3.2
Inserted attack
In this attack, the attacker takes a Bernoulli (κ) sam-
ple of the n tuples in relation R to form a subset
R’ ⊂R. He then takes a Bernoulli (1 −κ) sample U’
from a collection U of n tuples from other sources and
mixes the tuples in U’ and R’ to create his relation X
of approximately the same size as R.
Figure 4.
Compare our with old watermark technique.
The comparison show that our technique is resilient
to selected attack. While on the other hand, the old
technique deteriorates just after adding 10% of the
data set size. Figure 4. shows the resilience of our
watermarking technique to insertion attack, where the
watermark was recovered with 100% accuracy even
when up to 15% of the data set size tuples were
inserted.
3.3
Alteration attack
In this form of attack, violators try to alter some
attribute values of the relational database, which had
beenwatermarked,andstochasticallyaltertheattribute
values. Suppose that an attacker magically knows the
values of the ν and ξ parameters, used by the database
owner. Since the attacker does not know which bits
have been marked, he randomly selects a Bernoulli
(κ) sample from the n tuples. For each selected tuple,
he flips all of the bits in all ξ bit positions in all ν
attributes. It is important to bear in mind that when
the owner marks a tuple, he only perturbs a single bit,
whereas Mallory perturbs ξ × ν bits, thereby inflicting
much more damage on each tuple that he marks.
To be noted, the robustness of our algorithm has
close relation with marking frequency. The higher
marking frequency we get, the more robust it is. Yet a
compromise between robustness and imperceptibility
must be reached in the implementation phase. Figure 5
shows the experimental results; they clearly show that
our watermarking technique is resilient to a random
modify attack.

CONCLUSIONS
Much research has done on watermarking relational
databases. However, very few works focus on the
optimization of the watermark signals of relational
databases by using genetic algorithms.The results ver-
ify the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach.
Furthermore, compared with existing proposals, it also

implies the superiority of our approach over the previ-
ous ones. We have presented a resilient watermarking
technique for relational data that embeds watermark
bits in the data statistics. The algorithm proved to have
immunity to popular attacks on relational databases
and needed the smallest available bandwidth. In the
future, we intend to conduct research on improving the
robustness of the scheme by using GAs to watermark
embedding algorithms.

ABSTRACT:
Most glass composites products in engineering are manufactured by a pultrusion process.
Because the pultrusion process is affected by many factors, it is not easy to control the performance of products.
In order to obtain good performance and meet the requirements of glass composites products in specific parame-
ters, artificial neural network technology was adopted to optimize and design the pultrusion process. The results
showed that the curing degree of products increased gradually with the preheated mould temperature. During the
reverse design of glass composites products, it was found that when the spread is 0.3, the measured temperature
values of every stage based on curing degree were in good agreement with the forecasting values, which proved
the correctness of the reverse design. The research method in this paper provides important theoretical basis and
technical support for similar products.

INTRODUCTION
Glass reinforced plastic is commonly known as rein-
forced composite plastic, also known as Glass Fiber
Reinforced Plastic (GFRP). It is made of synthetic
resin as an adhesive and glass as a reinforcing material.
Composite materials are a combination of different
basesorreinforcingmaterials,suchasorganicpolymer
material, metal and inorganic non-metallic, in various
processes. In addition to retaining the main features
of component materials, composite materials can also
obtain unique properties that component materials do
not have through composite effect. With the devel-
opment of the times, cement or non-metallic based
composite materials have been gradually replaced by
GFRP. Most cable protection tubes made of GFRP
have better corrosion resistance and span with a
smooth surface which is beneficial for cleaning.
Pultrusion is a typical process for manufactur-
ing GFRP continuously and economically with many
features, such as high production efficiency, good
reproducibility, arbitrary length, raw material saving,
energy saving. In pultrusion process of GFRP, temper-
ature is one of the key factors affecting the forming
process. When the curing degree meets the require-
ments, if the temperature is the optimum value, the
energy consumption can be reduced and the costs can
be saved with the competitiveness of the products
increasing.
In this paper, the process plan of a GFRP pipe
was firstly determined by analysing its composition,
studying its properties and the pultrusion process.
According to the material properties, the temperature
of each stage was analysed and calculated. Then the
network model of the temperature and curing degree
was established, as based on the Radial Basis Function
artificial neural network (RBF) by using MATLAB.
After training, the network model could be used to
predict the temperature of each stage and then get
the optimum temperature, which could greatly cut
down on the amount of time spent on experiments,
reduce production costs, and improve the success rate
of pultrusion forming.

TRAINING AND PREDICTION OF RBF
NETWORK
The size of the GFRP pipe is: D = 22 mm, d = 6 mm,
the total length of pipe in one production of 1000 mm,
pultrusion rate of 20 m/h. This part is mainly installed
in the crossing area of the communication cable and
power line to prevent a short circuit caused by the
break of power line which may cause the communi-
cation cable and wire rope charged and then to protect
cables, switches, core boards and even the machine
from being burned.Also this part can isolate magnetic
field interference of the power line.

2.1
Training algorithms and measurement
indicators
In general, there are two methods to train and test arti-
ficial neural network models. One is ‘Leave-one-out’,
the other is ‘dichotomy’. By comparison, ‘Leave-one-
out’ can achieve a high forecasting accuracy and get
the best, reliable forecasting accuracy, though it has a
high workload and is time-consuming. In this paper,
‘Leave-one-out’ is used for training and testing RBF
network model. Specifically, based on using GFRP
temperature of each stage as input variables, the curing
degree as output variables and then building a net-
work model of three inputs and one output, the curing
degree of GFRP can be predicted after repeated train-
ing. Afterwards, the temperature can be determined
according to the curing degree through reverse design,
which can reduce experimental costs with a high preci-
sion and high efficiency. 7 set of data are used to train
the network model and by selecting different spread
values, the optimal model can be achieved.
For the qualitative and quantitative measurement
of the forecast performance of RBF, scatter plots and
statistical indicators are selected. The three statistical
indicators selected for quantitative measuring forecast
performance are Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean
Square Relative Error (MSRE) and Value of Fitness
(VOF), their formulas are shown respectively:
where: X1i is the measured value, X2i is the predicted
value, N is the sample size.
When the predicted value and the measured value
get closer, which is when the forecast performance
becomes better, MSE and MSRE get smaller and
approach to 0, the VOF gets bigger and approaches
to 2. When MSE and MSRE get bigger and farther
from 0, the VOF get smaller and farther from 2, the
forecast performance becomes worse.

Structure and training elements of RBF
network
The structure of an RBF Network model includes the
number of layers in the model, the number of neurons
in each layer, the type of the activation function and the
spread value of the model, etc. Here the significance of
spread value is explained. The model prediction accu-
racy is determined by the size of the spread value.
A lower spread value means better forecasting accu-
racy but more time consumption, while higher spread

stantly in the adjustment process so as to achieve the
best combination of accuracy and time. The model
training is selecting multiple sets of data to train the
neural network, and selecting different spread values
to determine the optimal model, which is ready for
forecasting. After training the model, the structure of
the network model has been adjusted and optimized.
If a new variable is entered, the model can predict the
result afterwards. As seen in table 1, 9 set of data have
been selected to train, wherein the pultrusion speed is
20 m/h.

Meanwhile the spread values were changed to
observe the effect of different training. Figure 1 shows
the training performance when the spread value is 0.4,
0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 1.
As can be seen from the Figure 1, when the spread
value is 0.4, 0.5 or 0.6, the points on scatter plots dis-
tribute substantially along the 45◦diagonal. However,
the distribution of points along the 45◦diagonal seems
worse and worse with the spread values increasing. It
can be seen that when the spread value reaches 1, the
scatter distribution is substantially horizontal which
indicates more training errors and a less effective
training result. By synthesizing analysing the scatter
plots with different spread values, the range of optimal
spread value in the RBF training model can be quali-
tatively determined, and some of the changes between
predicted and measured values in the graph can be
easily read out. The training performance of the artifi-
cial neural network model can be directly qualitatively
described through the scatter plot, but quantitative
description must rely on statistical indicators.
2.2.3
Statistical indicators
From Figure 1, it can be seen apparently that with the
spread value increasing, the prediction error decreases

firstly and then increases, which means that the pre-
diction accuracy increases firstly and then decreases
as the spread value increases. Different statistical indi-
cators can be obtained by taking training results based
on different spread values into the training program.
Table 2 shows mean square error, mean square relative
error, and the value of fitness.
By the table below, with the increasing spread val-
ues, mean square error and relative error are growing,
indicating the greater the deviation of the predicted
value and the measured value. When the spread
value is of 0.4, the mean square error and relative
error relative to the other groups are relatively small,
and the fitted values relatively close to 2, it was
decided to optimize the use of this spread is 0.4

FORECASTING AND IMPACT OF HEATING
TEMPERATURE ON CURING DEGREE
After training and testing of the artificial neural net-
work model, the structure has been optimized, with
the best, most reliable prediction performance. The
best spread value is 0.4, and on this condition the RBF
model can be used for forecasting curing degree on the
temperature of different stages. The samples were in
two groups, numbered 4 and 8. Comparisons of mea-
sured and predicted results of temperature on curing
degree are shown in Table 3.
Inputting measured and predicted values into pro-
gram for calculation of statistical indicators, the results
are as follows: MSE = 0.2007; MSRE = 0.0022;
VOF = 1.9987. It can be clearly seen from statistical
indicators that Mean Square Relative Error (MSRE)
and Mean Square Error (MSE) are very close to zero,
and the Value Of Fitness (VOF) is very close to 2. So
the predicted results meet the ideal requirements, and
this RBF model can be used in the pultrusion pro-
duction of GFRP pipes for optimizing the forming
process.
Figure 2 shows the influence of temperature on cur-
ing degree at different stages. As can be seen, with the
temperature increasing, the curing degree also gradu-
ally increased with nonlinear relationship between the
two. In actual production, the temperature is generally
not too high considering the production efficiency and
energy saving. Under the condition of obtaining appro-
priate performance, the temperature should not be too
high.

REVERSE DESIGN OF PROCESS
PARAMETERS BASED ON RBF
NETWORK
According to the curing degree, reverse design is
adoptedtodesignandoptimizethetemperatureofeach
stage for achieving the best predicted value. Similarly
with predicting the curing degree, the artificial neural
network model need training before using, called the
‘learning phase of model’.The purpose is to adjust the
structure of the artificial neural network model, reflect
the intrinsic relationship between the input and output
variables of training samples, and get the model that
hasthebestpredictionperformance.Spreadvalues0.3,
0.4, 0.5, 0.6 were selected to train the neural network
model.Aftertraining,itwasfoundthatwhenthespread
value is 0.3, the mean square error and mean square
relative error are relatively small, and the value of fit-
ness is close to 2 with the best performance. Figure 3

As it can be seen above, when the spread value is

focuses on the 45 degree line, indicating the predicted
temperature of each stage by curing degree has almost

noise and quality problem of samples, the mean square
error and mean square relative error do not equal zero,

but it has basically reached the requirement. Mean-
while the value of fitness is close to 2, indicating that

CONCLUSIONS
According to the pultrusion curing degree of GFRP
pipes, a neural network model was establish and after
training it was used for predicting the relationship
between temperatures and curing degrees at different
stages of pultrusion. First, to meet relevant require-
ments, the spread value based on the training results
should be modified.Then after training and testing, the
sample could be predicted and the forecasting results
were described by statistical indicators. The results
show that:
1) By using an artificial neural network, not only the
curing degree can be predicted according to the
temperature of each stage, but also the temperature
can be forecasted by curing degree with reverse
design.
2) After forecasting, the influence of each input vari-
able on the curing degree can be analysed to deter-
mine the optimal preheated temperature. Because
of the small ranges of data, the calculation results
do not change significantly, so the minimum spread
value cannot be set as the optimal value during pre-
diction.Thus the reverse design based on the curing
degree is made to analyse the influence of the cur-
ing degree on the preheated temperature at different
stages.
3) Due to the limited quantity and quality of samples,
the prediction accuracy of RBF model based on
these samples is surely affected. In order to anal-
yse more accurately of the relationship between the
curing degree and temperature in the pultrusion
process of a GFRP pipe, statistical indicators are
adopted in this paper to indicate that the prediction
method is correct and feasible.

ABSTRACT:
In the process of operation, the loading condition of an automobile steering knuckle is very
complex, which seriously affects its structure strength and fatigue life. In this paper, finite element analysis is
applied to calculate and analyse the deformation and stress distribution in a steering knuckle under conditions
of three kinds of limit load, which are the impulse force induced by rough ground, longitudinal impact caused
by emergency braking, and the transverse impact generated when the car turned. Based on this, a prediction of
the fatigue life on the more than 300000 times of cyclic loading is also carried out. The results show that under
the three kinds of limit load conditions, the maximum stress value of the steering knuckle of 940 MPa, which is
less than the yield strength of the steering knuckle materials, so the steering knuckle could not produce yield.
Fatigue strength analysis shows that the fatigue life application factor is 0.9375, less than 1, which illustrates
that fatigue damage will not occur. The study provides an important theoretical basis and technical support for
the actual design and industrial production of automobile steering knuckles.

INTRODUCTION
The steering knuckle is an important part of the vehicle
axle.Itissubjectedtoatangentialload,impactfromthe
ground, and transfers the steering force from the steer-
ing knuckle, it is also necessary to leave enough space
for brake to install Anti-lock Braking System sensor.
At the same time, the steering knuckle is connected
to the knuckle column, tie rod, shock absorber, brake
caliper, etc, so its structure is very complex, and the
requirements for strength, impact resistance, fatigue
strength, and reliability are high. Therefore, research
on steering knuckle life is necessary. In the motion
process, vehicle parts are subjected to a variety of alter-
nating loads. The alternating load is generally lower
than the tensile strength limit, so the steering knuckle
would not fail for strength reasons, but under the effect
of the alternating load repeatedly, it may occur crack
initiation and extension, and lead to a sudden rupture,
known as fatigue destruction. It is extremely impor-
tant to understand the influence of this damage form
on the strength of the steering knuckle.
Most external loads which are withstood by rolling
stock, are random loads which act repeatedly. Under
the effects of these kind of random dynamic loads,
many components will generate dynamic stresses and
cause fatigue damage. As the fatigue damage accu-
mulates, initial cracks will occur, extend, and finally
cause fracture, and this is the main form of struc-
tural damage. Thus, the structural fatigue design of
the rolling stock has gradually become one of the
necessary processes in the early stages of new prod-
uct development, while the prediction of the structure
fatigue life through an effective calculating method
is an important goal of structural design. This article
will focus on strength analysis and fatigue life predic-
tion on automobile steering knuckles, using the finite
element simulation technology.

STRESS AND DEFORMATION ANALYSIS
ON THE STEERING KNUCKLE
Thebottom-upmodelingmethodwasusedtocreatethe
model of the steering knuckle, and the basic modeling
order of the steering knuckle is as follows: the hub,
spherical area, the damping arm, the control arm, and
the tire control point. The complete model is shown in
Figure 1. The following work is then done, defining
the type of element, setting the unit cell size, material
attributes, and other parameters, using smart mesh-
ing technology to complete the knuckle model mesh,
shown in Figure 2.
The load of an automobile steering knuckle gener-
ally consists of two parts, namely, the static load gener-
ated by the hanging sprung mass, and the dynamic load
produced during the motion process. There are three
kinds of stress limit working conditions, as shown in
Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

This paper analysed the force and deformation on
the knuckle in the three different conditions, and the
results are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5.
It can be seen from Figure 3, in Condition 1, that the
values of deformation and displacement are largest on
the top of the damping arm of the steering knuckle, and
can reach 22.7 mm, which shows that the design here is
notveryreasonableitisnecessarytoincreasethethick-
ness and width of the damping arm. The maximum
stress point occurs in the middle of the damping arm,
whose value is 940 MPa, which is less than material

yield strength 1000 MPa, so the damping arm will not
be damaged, but still needs reinforcement.
It can be seen from Figure 4, in Condition 2, that
the values of deformation and displacement are largest
on the top of the damping arm of the steering knuckle,
and can reach 5.317 mm, which shows that the design
here is reasonable.The maximum stress point occurs in
the root of the damping arm, whose value is 520 MPa,
whichisfarlessthanmaterialyieldstrength1000MPa,
so the damping arm will not yield.
It can be seen from Figure 5, in Condition 3, that the
values of deformation and displacement are largest on
the top of damping arm of the steering knuckle, can
reach 2.029 mm, which shows that the design here is
reasonable. The maximum stress point occurs in the
top of damping arm, whose value is 706 MPa, which
is less than material yield strength 1000 MPa, so the
damping arm will not yield.

FATIGUE STRENGTH ANALYSIS ON THE
STEERING KNUCKLE
In this paper, the prediction on the fatigue life of the
steering knuckle is based on the elastic-plastic theory
and Miner’s linear cumulative damage rule.According
to Miner’s linear cumulative damage rule, it is assumed
that the cumulative damage and the number of stress
cycles have a linear relationship, and when the cumu-
lative damage reaches 1, material damage occurs. It
can be expressed by a mathematical expression as:
74

Figure 3.
Finite element calculation results in condition 1.
here, Di is the damage index under the i-th level
constant amplitude cyclic stress whose amplitude is Si,
ni is the times of cycles on a corresponding level, and
Ni is fatigue life under Si. The material of the steering
knuckle is 40CrNiMoA.
The analysis results are shown in Table 4.
It can be seen from Table 4, that the values of
the fatigue life application factor are all less than 1.
Figure 4.
Finite element calculation results in condition 2.
According to the linear cumulative damage rule, only
when the damage accumulation reaches 1, does mate-
rial damage occur, thus, in the three conditions above,
the steering knuckle which works under 300000 times
of cyclic loading will not fail at all.

SUMMARY
In this paper, finite element analysis is applied to anal-
yse the deformation and stress distribution in a steering
knuckle under conditions of three kinds of limit load.
In combination with fatigue strength theory, a fatigue
life application factor under 300 000 times of load-
ing cycles is calculated.The following conclusions are
gained:
1) Strength analysis is conducted usingANSYS. It can
be seen that under different conditions, displace-
ment distribution maps, displacement moir maps,
and stress distribution maps are different, and also
the maximum displacement and maximum stress
values are different. However, the maximum stress
values under different conditions are all within the
yield strength, so the steering knuckle does not
yield and strength damage will not occur.
2) Fatigue life factors are calculated based onANSYS
and linear cumulative damage theory. It can be con-
cluded that the maximum fatigue life application
factor is 0.93750, less than 1, that is, fatigue dam-
age will not occur under 300 000 times of loading
cycles in all of the three conditions.
3) In the process of simulation, a dangerous point
is found, and it is the main cause of the initial
crack, crack extension, and the flowing fatigue
damage. The main way to solve this question is
to: increase the transition fillet radius, relieve the
stress concentration, and reduce the surface rough-
ness. Surface quality to some extent also affects
the fatigue strength of the parts, so reducing the
surface roughness can reduce or avoid the genera-
tion of defects, thereby improving the fatigue life.
Within a certain range, improving the parts surface
hardness of the dangerous area on the parts sur-
face can strengthen the anti-fatigue properties of
parts. For this purpose, surface hardening meth-
ods can be used, such as carburizing, nitriding, shot
peening etc.

ABSTRACT:
The essences of computational thinking are abstraction and automation.Abstraction and automa-
tion in C++ programming language are discussed. Abstraction in C++ is the modelling process during which
the symbols in C++ are used to describe the system accurately and strictly. Automation in C++ means that
some operations are worked on the abstract modules composed of symbols, and these operations are executed
in sequential or non-sequential flow structure. Finally, simple examples about abstraction, enumeration, recur-
sion, iteration, reasoning, simulation, polymorphism, and overloading are given to show the case base about the
computational thinking in C++ programming language.

INTRODUCTION
Computational thinking is taking an approach to solv-
ing problems, designing systems, and understanding
human behaviour that draws on concepts fundamental
to computing (Wing 2006). Computational thinking
is a kind of analytical thinking (Wing 2008). Compu-
tational thinking is influencing research in nearly all
disciplines, both in the sciences and the humanities
(Bundy 2007).
There are three typical ways of scientific think-
ing: positive thinking marked by observation and
induction, logical thinking marked by reasoning and
deduction, and computational thinking marked by
abstraction and automation (Chen 2012, Li 2012).
The principal characteristics about computational
thinking are abstraction and automation. Abstraction
is the process of using the symbol system to describe
the problem which needs to be solved strictly and
accurately.Automation means that some operation can
be made on these symbols and then be automatically
executed according to some flow.
There are so many methods in computer science to
reflect computational thinking, such as enumeration,
recursion, iteration, simulation, reasoning, polymor-
phism, and overloading. So it is necessary to build
a case base about the computational thinking, when
C++ programming language is studied.

ESSENCE OF COMPUTATIONAL THINKING
Some teachers always use simple examples for
students during the teaching process of C++
programming language. They focus on how to use the
programming language in the correct syntax, not on
how to understand the principles hiding behind these
examples. This has the advantage that students learn
how to write simple programs quickly, but has the
disadvantage that students consider programming to
be just the process of using these tools, such as cod-
ing, debugging, building, and linking. This teaching
style of instrumentalism easily leads to the habit of
copying code for students who do not understand the
computational thinking behind the program.
2.1
Abstraction
One essence of computational thinking is abstrac-
tion. The abstractions in C++ are extremely general
because they are symbolic. For the programming using
C++, the abstraction is the modelling process, dur-
ing which the symbols in C++ are used to describe
the system accurately. This system may be a real one
like student management, or may be an abstract one
like a virtual game. The program is the product of
the abstraction of the system. The system has some
basic characteristics and some important activities.
The operands in C++ are used to describe these char-
acteristics, and the functions in C++ are used to
describe these activities. There are many activities in
the system and there are some complex relationships
among these activities. For example, the function to
compute the definite integration maybe call the func-
tion to compute the value of the mathematical function
at some point. If this mathematical function is com-
posed of many deterministric functions such as sine

with the different data type
function, cosine function, and tangent function, these
functions should be called in turn by the mathematical
function. This is called the multilevel calling of the
function in C++.
The operands in C++ can be divided into variables
and constants. The constants are used to describe the
characteristics with unchangeable values, such as the
circumference ratio.The variables are used to describe
the characteristics with changeable values, such as the
circumference radius. Both constants and variables
must have a value range and the permitted opera-
tions. For example, the score of course generally has
a value range from 0 to 100 and the permitted oper-
ations include addition, subtraction, and comparison.
However, the name of course can not be operated by
these arithmetic operators. Data type in C++ can be
used to define the value range for these characteristics
and the permitted operations. The abstract modules in
C++ are shown in Table 1.
C++ is an object-oriented programming language.
Class in C++ is used to abstract the substance in the
real world, and object in C++ corresponds to the real
instance.
2.2
Automation
Another essence of computational thinking in C++ is
automation.Automation means that the operations are
executed automatically in sequential or non-sequential
flow structure. For the execution of a program written
in C++ language, automation is supported by the EIP
(Extended Instruction Pointer) register, which always
points to the next address of instruction to be executed,
and the stack in memory, which has the last-in-first-out
requirement.
When the content of the EIP register increases by
itself, the instructions inside the function can be exe-
cuted in sequence. With the support of the stack in
memory, the jump between functions can be easily
implemented. The change in the stack in memory is
shown in Figure 1, when the following program in
C++ is executed:
Figure 1.
Change about the stack in memory.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Student
{
public:
Student(int pId)
{
id=pId;
}
public:
int id;
};
void printStudent(Student s1)
{
cout<<s1.id<<endl;
}
int main()
{
int id=1001;
Student s(id);
printStudent(s);
return 0;
}
When the main function is called, the stack in mem-
ory is allocated for this function to store its local
variable id and s. When the printStudent function is
called, the stack in memory is allocated for this func-
tion to store its local variable s1 at the top of stack.
At the same time, the program control is transferred
into the printStudent function. When the printStudent
finishes, the program control returns back to the main
function. The stack for the printStudent function is
deleted. When the main function finishes, the program
control returns back to the operating system and this
program is over. The last-in-first-out character about
the stack in memory guarantees that the top of the stack
is only used for the function to get the program control.

CASE BASE ABOUT COMPUTATIONAL
THINKING
The essence of computational thinking is abstraction
and automation. However, computational thinking in
80

C++ has many different forms, such as iteration, poly-
morphism, and recursion. So it is necessary to build
the case base in C++ to master these different forms
of computational thinking.
3.1
Abstraction
Abstraction in C++ is the process where the data type
is used to describe the important characteristics of the
system to be developed. For example, a variable with
the int data type can be used to define the number of
students in a class.
int number;
An array with the float data type can be used to
define the length of students in a class.
float length[30];
The class Student can define the characteristics and
activities for the real students abstractly.
class Student
{
};
3.2
Enumeration
Enumeration is the process of listing all the possi-
ble results in order. Enumeration is the direct search
method to find the solution. Although it is simple, it
can easily be forgotten. The problem about finding
the daffodil number can be solved in the enumeration
method, as shown in the following:
for(j=100;j<1000;j++)
{
a=j%10;
b=(j/10)%10;
c=(j/100)%10;
i=a*a*a+b*b*b+c*c*c;
if(i==j)
printf(" %d\n",j);
}
3.3
Recursion
Recursion in C++ means that a function can call itself
directly and indirectly. A classic example of recursion
is the definition of the factorial function and the code
is as follows:
int factorial(unsigned int n)
{
if (n == 0)
{
return 1;
}
else
{
return n * factorial(n −1);
}
}
3.4
Iteration
Iteration is the act of repeating a process with the aim
of approaching a desired goal. Unlike recursion, this
repeating is often implemented in a loop control state-
ment in C++. For example, the iteration formula to
solve the square root of a positive number is as follows:
xn+1 = 1/2 ∗(xn + a/xn).
According to this formula, the iteration process in
C++ is shown in the following:
x0 = a/2;
x1=(x0+a/x0)/2;
do
{
x0 = x1;
x1=(x0+a/x0)/2;
}while (fabs(x0-x1)>=1e-8);
Here, a is the positive number, x0 corresponds to
xn, and x1 corresponds toxn+1.
3.5
Simulation
Simulation in C++ is the process which uses the
probability function to enumerate the real case. The
following code is to simulate the probability of head
or tail appearance for a coin-tossing game:
srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
printf("input the test times: );
scanf("%d",&n);
i = n;
while(n–)
{
if(x=rand()%2)
num[1]++;
else
num[0]++;
}
Here, for every different seed value used in a call
to srand, the pseudo-random number generator can be
expected to generate a different succession of results
in the subsequent calls to rand
3.6
Reasoning
Reasoning is the capacity for consciously making
sense of things, applying logic for establishing and
verifying facts, and changing or justifying practices,
institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing
information (Nikolas 2000). There are many kinds of
reasoning. Here, just case-based reasoning is intro-
duced. Case-based reasoning is the process of solving
new problems based on the solutions of similar past
problems.The calculation about the similarity between
the new problem and the past case is very important
for case-based reasoning. The following code is to
compute the similarity, the new suspect, and the past
criminals in the case library:
double computeSimilarity(struct criminal c1, struct
criminal c2)
{
double similarity = 0.0;
double distance = 0.0;
distance+ =abs(c1.length-c2.length);
81

distance+ =abs(c1.lengthOfArm-c2.lengthOfArm);
distance+ =abs(c1.lengthOfFace-c2.lengthOfFace);
distance+ =abs(c1.lengthOfLeg-c2.lengthOfLeg);
distance+ =abs(c1.weight-c2.weight);
distance+ =abs(c1.widthOfFace-c2.widthOfFace);
if(distance==0)
similarity = 1.0;
else
similarity = 1.0/distance;
return similarity;
}
3.7
Polymorphism
Polymorphism means the occurrence of something in
different forms. In C++, the access to different types
of objects through a common base class is done by
using a pointer of the type of the base object to point
to the objects which derive from that base class. The
following code shows that the base pointer ppoly can
access the two different derived objects rect and trgl:
class Polygon {
protected:
int width, height;
public:
void set_values (int a, int b)
{ width=a; height=b; }
virtual int area (void) =0;
};
class Rectangle: public Polygon {
public:
int area (void)
{ return (width * height); }
};
class Triangle: public Polygon {
public:
int area (void)
{ return (width * height / 2); }
};
int main () {
Rectangle rect;
Triangle trgl;
Polygon * ppoly=&rect;
ppoly->set_values(4,5);
cout<<ppoly->area()<<endl;
ppoly=&trgl;
ppoly->set_values(4,5);
cout<<ppoly->area()<<endl;
}
3.8
Overloading
Overloading allows a function or a data type to be writ-
ten generically so that it can handle values identically
without depending on their type (Pierce 2002). Over-
loading is a way to make a language more expressive
whilestillmaintainingfullstatictypesafety. Overload-
ing in C++ can be divided into function overloading,
operator overloading, function template overloading,
and class template overloading. The following code
shows the overloading between two functions with the
same name add:
int add(int a,int b)
{
int c;
c = a + b;
return c;
}
float add(float a,float b)
{
float c;
c = a + b;
return c;
}

CONCLUSION
Abstraction and automation in C++ programming
language are discussed in detail. Simple examples
about abstraction, enumeration, recursion, iteration,
reasoning, simulation, polymorphism, and overload-
ing are given to show the case base about the compu-
tational thinking in C++.

Discussion on the teaching methods for a computer network course
HuiTing Wu & YanMei Liu
College of Information Engineering, Chutian College, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China
ABSTRACT:
A computer network course is a professional, required course for computer majors.The course is
wide-ranging, has abstract content, and a very strong theory content. It includes a lot of concepts, definitions, and
protocol. Generally, students feel that the learning content is abstract and boring.According to the characteristics
that the independent college students learn the course, the paper puts forward methods to improve classroom
teaching and to cultivate quality computer application specialty talents, which aim to improve the students’
computer network course learning enthusiasm and ability to solve practical problems.
1
RESEARCH BACKGROUND
With the rapid development of the computer network,
a computer network course’s requirement is the cul-
tivation of a skill, which is a subject with strong
practicability and wide application. On the other hand,
a computer network course is an important manifes-
tation of teaching and scientific research, organically
combined for teachers. It is also an important con-
version of passive learning and active learning for
students. In the independent colleges, which mainly
train applied talents, we need to advocate the setting up
ofnewteachingideas,reformtheteachingmethod,and
improve students’ autonomous learning ability, analy-
sis and problem solving ability, and practical ability.
The teacher must carefully study teaching methods to
make students better master the course. The teacher
should focus on the students’ thinking to inspire and
stimulate students’ interest in the classroom. At the
same time, the teacher should pay attention to letting
the students know the ’hows’ but not the ’whys’ when
teaching knowledge points.
The practice proved that through the classroom
method, students should be able to understand and
master the computer network more quickly and deeply,
and improve their skills.

EXISTING PROBLEMS
2.1
Boring theory teaching
Studentshavehighexpectationsofacomputernetwork
course due to the rapid development of the network.
However, after a few classes, the students often find
that the course is not as simple as they imagined it to
be. The characteristics of this course are that there are
too many and miscellaneous knowledge points, with
strong theory, and abstractness. Logical thinking and
stereo mapping are needed. If the teacher still blindly
echoes what the books say in class, and only talks about
the principle of the network, it is very difficult to guide
the students’ learning interest.
2.2
The dispersed knowledge point
Traditional teaching uses the bottom-up teaching
method. For example, the system structure of the
network is explained from the physical layer to the
application layer. The protocols and technology that
are involved in each layer, have separate explana-
tions. Students find this difficult to digest, and lose
the learning initiative.
2.3
Disconnection between experiment and reality
For the experiment of this computer network course,
students are required to study hardware knowledge
of the network including the computer, the com-
munication link, and the network equipment. Also,
knowledge about the network software should be
learnt, namely the network protocols and architecture.
However, by the experiment’s environmental restric-
tion, the course’s current experimental projects are
mainly verification experiments such as simple net-
works or application layer protocol configuration, and
comprehensive and design experiments are less. Many
students still learn the low layer protocols by rote, and
thus they cannot understand their practical application.
3
TEACHING METHODS
3.1
Analogy method
In computer network course teaching, teachers often
have to explain some concept which is abstract and dif-
ficult to understand. When some very abstract concept
83

is not easy to understand, the teacher can give living
examples to study which is very similar and more
familiar by people. This method can help students
intuitively and vividly understand abstract knowledge.
The system structure is the key content in a com-
puter network course. Students generally reflect that it
is very abstract for understanding this part content. So
the teacher can use analogy method to explain this part
content. We can compare the hierarchical structure of
the network to the courier company management sys-
tem. Item which is sent from Beijing to Shanghai will
go through the following process: After item is pack-
aged, the courier writes the destination address, post
code and telephone number in a letter. Then the item
is sent to the delivery department service in Beijing.
Express company staffs will baggage sorting accord-
ing to the destination address. Already sorting good
packages are delivered to the train station or other
transport sector. The transport sector will make pack-
ages packed in bales which are ready for transport.
After that item is transported the express to Shanghai.
Shanghai express company inspects items and assigns
to the subsidiary company. Then courier delivers the
items to the people who receive them. After people
who receive the item sign, the whole transport task is
completed. Teacher can explain the OSI (Open Sys-
tems Interconnection) model from the bottom to the
top of the function using the analogy method to make
students vividly understand the concept of hierarchy.
If the data encapsulation in the system structure, such
as the concept of protocol data unit is not well under-
stood, the teacher can continue to cite examples. The
package is a manifestation of goods in the sender and
recipient hand. The package is for the performance
of bagging state in Beijing or Shanghai express com-
pany, and is shown as packed in bales of selected state
both in the transportation sector. The form of package
is not the same in different levels. While at the same
level, the form is the same. It can help the students
to understand the various layers of the PDU (Protocol
Data Unit). In the architecture of the express company,
the sender / recipient of this layer is the upper layer of
the system. The express company is the lower layer
of the system. We can see that the express company
serves for its upper layer and the transport department
serves for express company. This analogy method can
let students better understand the relationship between
different layers in the system structure. We can give an
example to explain the task of each layer. A mother
let the child go to wash the clothes, and the mother is
waiting for airing clothes in the balcony. First of all, the
mother does not care about that child washes clothes
with soap or washing powder. It is OK as long as the
clothes are washed. Secondly, if there is soap powder
on the child’s washed clothes (This layer of the task for
child is not well completed), it will affect the mother
to air the clothes. It can help students to understand
that each layer divides the work to complete the task.
It is a difficulty for student to understand the tech-
nology of CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access
with Collision Detection). The working process of
CSMA/CD can be understood through the analogy of
many students meeting in a dark room.The IEEE802.3
standard LAN in which all computers share transmis-
sion media can be likened that the students talk in a
very small and totally dark room and only a person is
allowed to speak in the same time. When understand-
ing carrier sense, it can be likened that one student
who will speak should check to see whether other stu-
dents are speaking. If not, the student can begin to
speak. When understanding multiple accesses, it is as
if each of the students in the room has the same abil-
ity to speak. Conflict detection is that if there are two
students speaking at the same time. Everybody cannot
hear any person’s speech because of the occurrence
of conflict. When this happens, the two students need
to stop the continued talking at once and wait for a
random period of time. The students repeat the above
process until speech is successful. If there are too many
failures, the student, perhaps, gives up the idea of a
speech.
Through the analogy method, it not only allows
students to have a deeper understanding of the knowl-
edge, but it also makes the students concretize abstract
problems when understanding the knowledge points.
3.2
Heuristic method
Heuristic teaching can be reflected through the form
of a question and answer, a lecture and a practice. It
also can be realized through the teacher’s vivid lecture
to make students leave a deep impression. In com-
puter network teaching, we must use all the available
means to inspire students to broaden their thinking. For
example, when the relationship between the channel
utilization and time delay is talked about in the net-
work, we can choose a question to ask which is closely
related to the life of the students. Then we inspire the
students to think about the problem to get the answer.
For example, channel utilization means that a channel
is used in the percentage of time in the computer net-
work. If the channel utilization rate is 10%, it means
this channel is occupied for 10% of the time and idle
for 90% of the time. It is not better if channel utiliza-
tion is higher. The relationship of delay and utilization
rate is proportional. The students are often easily con-
fused when trying to understand the problem. In our
teaching, we can inspire students to think about when
they use broadband access at home; the students want
to browse webpages fast or often disconnect the inter-
net. The communication channel is often shared used
for the majority of users. From the user’s point of view
to consider the problem, the user certainly hopes that
the utilization ratio of the communication channel is
very low. In this case, the user can use it whenever he
likes.And the user also doesn’t meet that the channel is
too busy to use. It is random that the user uses a public
communication channel. If there are too many people
using the channel at a certain time, the channel may be
in the busy state. The users’ complaints increase, and
they are not even willing to use the services provided
by the company. It will force the telecommunication
84

companies to increase investment to expand the capac-
ityofthecommunicationlinesforreducingtheaverage
utilization rate of the communication channel.
Through the inspiration above, it not only allows
the students to deepen their comprehension and mem-
ory of knowledge, but it also explains the practical
problems in life.
3.3
The task-driven method
The task-driven method requires the establishment of
a task ‘goal’ and teaching situation. It can make the
students learn in the exploration with the real task.
The computer network course in this experiment, is
a practical course, and it is suitable for the method.
Firstly, the teacher forms groups as a unit to create sit-
uations, and puts forward the task in each experiment
class. For example, a company has two departments,
sales and technology, and the personal computer sys-
tem of the sales department is connected to different
switches. These need to communicate with each other,
but for data security reasons, the sales and technology
departments need to be isolated from each other. Now,
appropriate configuration is needed on the switch to
achieve this goal. Through the setting of this task,
it enables the students to master realizing port iso-
lation on the switch by the division of Port VLAN
(Virtual LocalArea Network).Then the computer sys-
tems in the same VLAN can communicate with each
other across a switch, but the computer systems in a
different VLAN cannot communicate with each other.
Students need trial, exploration, tasks research, and
correct execution in a specified time. Secondly, teach-
ers need to explain, demonstrate, reform, and innovate
according to the situation so that the students complete
the task. Finally, the teacher will evaluate, check, and
summarise for the completion situation of each group.
‘Task-driven’ is a learning method which is appli-
cable to learning knowledge and skills of an operation
class. It has formed a basic characteristic of ‘task’
as the main line, ‘teacher’ as the leading factor, and
‘student’ as the main body.
4
STIMULATION ON STUDENTS’ INTEREST
The great scientist Einstein said: “Interest is the best
teacher.” Once students have a strong interest in some-
thing, they will take the initiative to seek knowledge,
explore, and practice.A cheerful mood and experience
are generated in the process of seeking knowledge,
exploring,andpracticing.Thecharacteristicsofacom-
puter network course are that the network technology
is complex and conceptual, and the principles are
abstract to understand. However, it is unique in that
the network originates from the life and the demands
of people, thereby promoting the formation and devel-
opment of the network. So a lot of use of network
technology can be found in life. According to the
characteristics of the network, teachers should com-
bine their teaching with practical application and use
a concrete example in life to connect the concept
which is complex and difficult to understand in real
life. For example, when the concept of a hierarchical
computer network is explained, we can give exam-
ples from life: If a cook hopes his apprentice to do
a delicious meal, he must be hurry-scurry. But if he
assigns the task that one apprentice cooks coffee, one
apprentice fries chips and one apprentice fries sand-
wich, this division of labour collaboration is easier to
make a rich feast (with dynamic courseware of vivid
colour). The idea of ‘divide and rule’ is introduced to
solve smaller and simpler problems. So, the big prob-
lem of a computer network is solved too. Such a vivid
metaphor can help students understand the abstract
concept of stratification to receive more with less
effort. When explaining simplex, half duplex, and full
duplex concept, we can combine the remote controller,
interphone, and mobile phone in life. When talking
about TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP
(User Datagram Protocol) protocols, the respective
characteristicsanddifferenceofthetwoprotocolsneed
to be introduced. We can show the example of file
transferinlife.Becausewedonotwanttolosethefiles,
TCP protocol is selected in the transport layer. UDP
protocol can be selected in the transmission of video.
In addition, when introducing the three handshakes in
TCP protocol, we can start from a network popular
joke which only a programmer can understand. Then
students are gradually introduced to the principles of
learning.
The abstract problem which needs to be solved in
the network is introduced with a real life scenario. It
can help to stimulate students’ interest by making a
classroom atmosphere active.
5
LET THE STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THE
‘HOWS’ BUT NOT THE ‘WHYS’
When teachers explain new knowledge or review old
knowledge in the introduction of relevant knowledge,
students need to understand the ‘hows’ but not the
‘whys’ for learning the knowledge. When explain-
ing the production of a twisted pair, we have to ask
why twisted pair production must be conformed to
the TIA/EIA586B standard, in addition to demonstrat-
ing the basic steps of conventional cable production
(using pictures or video presentation). Then the 586B
and 586A standard is introduced. Then we can explain
that if the student is not in accordance with this stan-
dard, the cable will appear unforeseen phenomenon.
Further what is the straight line and cross line can be
extended to introduce. So it lets the students not only
learn to make double strands, but also understand why
it should be produced like that and how to use it after
making it.

CONCLUSION
As the saying goes, ‘Give a man a fish and you feed
him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed
85

him for a lifetime.’ Teachers should not only teach
the students knowledge and skills, but also cultivate
the students to obtain a desire to learn and master the
ways of learning.A computer network course contains
more content, is more difficult, and has a wider appli-
cation than other courses. Teachers should focus on
cultivating the students’ ability of analysis, software
development, network management, and innovation
based on network protocol.

The application of EXCEL in sampling
Chao Ling Qin
School of Physical Education, Southwest China Normal University, Chongqing, China
ABSTRACT:
Sampling is an important part of scientific research, and it is related to the reliability, accuracy
and scientificity of the research data. This paper lists several methods to achieve simple random sampling and
systematic sampling using EXCEL software, aiming to provide technical security and reference for scientific
sampling.
1
INTRODUCTION
The first step of scientific research is to collect
information and obtain the sample data, but unrep-
resentative sample data is worthless for the research.
The aim of sampling is to select samples in a sci-
entific way to represent the whole in order to get
reliable data and accurately determine the situation of
the whole, thus studying the characteristics or regu-
larity of the whole. It could save a lot of human and
material resources and time. Theoretically speaking
[1], for the whole with many units, the comprehensive
characteristics of one unit are in line with the char-
acteristics of the whole. When it is difficult to study
the whole or the sample could be used to replace the
whole, we use sampling to study the situation of the
whole. However, how to carry out sampling and ensure
its scientificity is a key problem. Probability theory
studies have shown that [2] sampling should follow
the random sampling principle to enable the sample
to better represent the whole. Probability sampling
mainly includes simple random sampling, systematic
sampling, stratified sampling and cluster sampling and
so on. EXCEL software can be used to achieve the sev-
eral sampling and provide a technical guarantee for the
scientific research.
2
SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING
If every unit in the whole has the same possibility to
be selected (random sampling), and the components of
the whole stay the same after the removal of one unit
(independence of sampling), this sampling method is
called simple random sampling.
2.1
Simple random sampling implemented by

using Excel are shown as Figure 11.
Step ①: Respectively input 1 and 2 at A2 and A3.
Select A2 and A3, move the cursor to the lower right
corner, and the cursor changes to a solid +. Generate
1-200 integers with the filling method as the simu-
lated number of students, as shown Figure 1; input
“=rand()” function →click “Enter” at B2 to generate
the first random number of the first student, as shown
in Figure 1.
Step ②: Use the fill handle to generate 200 random
numbers for 200 students, as shown in Figure 2. To fix
the random numbers, randomly select all the numbers,
and click “Edit” →“Copy”; “Edit” →“Paste selec-
tively”. The dialog box in Figure 3 appears. Paste the
“Selected Value” in the dialog box; select “None” for
“Operator” →click “OK”, and the value is pasted in
the original position.

C2 in the “Output Area”, →click “yes” to complete
the sample of random numbers of 50 students.

SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING
Systematic sampling is arranged according to a certain
order. Carry out sampling based on a fixed interval
which depends on the ratio of the required number
of samples and the number units in the whole. The
initiative number must be randomly determined. Sys-
tematic sampling has better representativeness than
simple random sampling, for the sample individuals
are evenly distributed among the whole. The com-
bination of systematic sampling and simple random
sampling could achieve the optimal effects.
3.1
Use the EXCEL random function to achieve
systematic sampling
Case 3: In a whole with 1500 individuals, using
systematic sampling method to randomly select 37
individuals as samples, shown as follows:
Step ①: input the first number at A1 in the EXCEL
sheet, input 1 at B1; input the last number at A2, input
1500 at B2, input the number of samples at A3, input
37 at B3; input the interval at A4, input “= B2/B3”
at B4. Click “Enter” to get the interval 40.54054, as
shown in Figure 11.
Step ②: Insert a row below B4, put the integral spac-
ing, which can be replaced by 41 after rounding or use
the ROUND () function: enter “= ROUND (B4, 0)”
“at B5 (Description: If it is necessary to make B4 an
integer, input 0; if it is necessary to keep one decimal
place for B4, enter 1, etc., as shown in Figure 12, and
then click “Enter” and the spacing is changed to 41.
Step ③: Enter “= RANDBETWEEN (B1, B5)” at
B6, as shown in Figure 13, click “Enter” to get the first
randomly selected number.

RANDOM NUMBER TABLE
The random number table is to randomly draw 0-9 and
compile these numbers as a table [1]. In any statistical
book, there is a random number table in the appendix
for future use. If there is no available one, EXCEL can
be used to make a table, shown as follows:

CONCLUSION
In addition to the simple random sampling and sys-
tematic sampling, probability sampling also includes
stratified sampling and cluster sampling and so on.
Stratifiedsampling[ii]istoclassifytheindividualsina
whole into several types or layers according to a certain
property, and ten carry out simple random sampling in
proportion to generate the research samples. Besides,
the EXCEL method in the simple random sampling
and systematic sampling could also be used to achieve
the sampling of single type or layer, and then use these
samples to compose the samples of the whole. Clus-
ter sampling [iii] is to regard cluster as the sampling
unit, and then sample several clusters to constitute the
samples according to simple random sampling and
systematic sampling. Therefore, the cluster sampling
could also be achieved by EXCEL method.
As the probability sampling in scientific research
involves theatrical and practical problems, research
workers should constantly acquire new knowledge
and technologies to improve sampling accuracy and
quality.

INTRODUCTION
MOOC, namely the Massive Open Online Course, can
provide high quality learning resources and a complete
learning experience for the majority of people on the
education of learning, especially, what it is obvious of
a revolutionary impact on education in higher educa-
tion. As a new learning concept. An MOOC advocates
autonomous learning, and provides a corresponding
flexible, as well as simple, knowledge organization
form, and a vivid manifestation course to learners.
However, as an immature method of learning, the
implementation of an MOOC also encounters many
difficulties.The major obstacles include:
(1) The learners are difficult to stick to complete the
course with lacking of instructors. In an unsuper-
vised learning environment, the most difficult part
of learning is “information overload” that is fac-
ing too much knowledge, which making leaeners
do not know how to choose it. At the same time,
the teacher can easily give students guidance in
the traditional learning environment, however, the
number of learners can easily reach over tens of
thousands in an MOOC environment, and teach-
ers’ guidance becomes impossible. Therefore, the
numberoflearnerscaneasilyshrinkcausingahigh
dropout rate, such as the online courses in arti-
ficial intelligence from Coursera which attracted
160,000 students at the initial launch, but in
the end only 14% of these learners finished the
course[1].
(2) An MOOC is difficult for learners to gain the skills
providing with the interaction, such as critical
analysis and learning to put forward its own ideas
and discussions and high level thinking etc[2].
Some MOOC organizers (such as Coursera) intro-
duced mutual learning to deal with it, such as
peer assessment, and discussion groups etc, but
students also faced difficulties to choose an appro-
priate peer and build trust network, as well as other
practical difficulties.
The introduction of an educational recommender
system in the process of an MOOC can help stu-
dents learning, and it is hoped that the above
problem will be solved satisfactorily, as shown
below:
(1) It can provide learning guidance with the help of
an education recommended system. The recom-
mender system based on peer to peer technology,
that is, study the behaviour of other peer learn-
ers, which is based on the learning characteristics
and learning progress of the current learner to
recommend the learning resources. Thus, the rec-
ommender result is personalized and consistent
with the actual needs of learners. In addition, the
recommender existence creates a direction of the
learning environment to reduce the difficulty of
courses completed and increase the possibility of
courses completed.
(2) The recommender system can help students to
build Interactive Web Personalization. Based on
the characteristics of the learners, with their own
as well as the information of other learners,
the recommender system can quickly compare
the similarities and differences between learn-
ers to recommend the most suitable learners to
form a partnership, which is much better than
the user with blinding study, and also can over-
come the users shyness and timid to interactive
others.
This paper, based on the above analysis, explores
the design of a personalized educational recommender
system for the MOOC, which can greatly enhance the
quality of the implementation and improve the user
experience of the MOOC. Compared with the tradi-
tional network video courses, the MOOC has a very
important change what provides resources provided
services in a single such as certification courses and
test and discuss etc, which those given the static course
with a new vitality. An MOOC-based educational rec-
ommender system can make these services richer and
93

more delicious. Othersides it paves the way for this
innovative learning form the brilliant learning style.

THE RESEARCH STATUS AT HOME AND
ABROAD
2012 was known as the “MOOC year”, and it was
immediately popular begin from its introduction.
Nowadays, many international first-class universities
and domestic well-known colleges and universities
have joined the MOOC camp. The current research
on the MOOC remains in the warm-up phase[1−5], and
needs further exploration.
The research of an educational recommender sys-
tem, although the number of less than the burgeoning
business recommender systems, have begun to form
scale; Among them, Buder believes recommendation
systems in e-commerce have been very widely applied,
but the majority of applications for education develop-
mentgonofurtherthantheprototypesystemstage;and
commercial recommender system should be reformed
to deep transformation for education recommender
system[6]. In recent years, the educational recom-
mender system have the Linton’s recommender sys-
tems of description for “software function learning”,
which a recommender method design to long-term
observe of the conditions of using a desktop soft-
ware, and it can provide help for the use of software[7].
Drachsler describes a learning environment that is
based on the hybrid network technology, where the
environment is based on a Web2.0 learning network to
provide useful information for the user; and the user
can specify the Web2.0 framework service to point the
information provided with training the recommender
system[8]. Hsu proposed a use for ESL(English as a
Second Language) teachers’ teaching recommender
systems that can help teachers to position difficul-
ties in the learning process of students[9]. The analysis
of educational recommender systems have also pub-
lished, such as Aehnelt etc are presented for a social
technology model of use of collaborative learning in
workshop[10]; Femandez analysis for the health edu-
cational recommender system facing opportunity and
challenge[11]. Kardan presents the recommender ref-
erence tool using concept maps and labels[12]; Liu
Xudong describes a basic framework of a learning
information recommender system[12−13], and Wang
Zhimei uses a learning state evaluation vector to calcu-
late the similarity between the learner, and introduce a
recommender system of Agent Technology to achieve
the learning content[14]. Wang Yonggu, Sun Xin, and
so on, used collaborative filtering technique to realize
recommender resources and described the correspond-
ing system architecture[15−16]. SHI Lin compared the
similarities and differences of online shopping and
online learning recommender systems and applicable
recommender technology[17].
The most literature on the research of educational
recommender systems takes a purely technical point
of view, ignoring the special of what educational
recommender system. In fact, the educational recom-
mender system, unlike the commercial recommender
system in many aspects, so it is not suitable for edu-
cation recommender system with only considering the
application environment and the user experience and
will simply commercial recommended technology and
algorithm of system copy. This article is written from
the educational designer’s perspective, rather than the
algorithm designer’s perspective, and fully considers
theeducationalenvironmentofrecommendersystems,
and combines the special requirements of the MOOC
to design an educational recommender system.

THE DESIGN OF AN EDUCATIONAL
RECOMMENDER SYSTEM FOR THE MOOC
3.1
System design
Starting with the learning environment’s characteris-
tics of massive open online courses and the actual
needs of learners, research into the design methods of
personalized education has recommended a system,
which closely combined with MOOC, can, accord-
ing to the current situation of learners, recommend
the learning resources which form a learning guide to
reduce the difficulty of learning.
Research ideas take three ways to do many things
to shoulder that educational theory as the guide and
the MOOC system as the structural basis as well as
the commercial recommended algorithm, driven as an
engine prototype, designed to meet the educational
concept and meet the MOOC’s actual needs and the
leading level of the operation’s efficiency educational
recommended system.
(1) By the theory of pedagogy as system design
guidelines
The fundamental purpose of the recommended
system is to promote learning. Therefore it must
be based on an educational theory as the design
guide.WANG Ping[5] believes that most of the cur-
rent MOOC is focused on the traditional teaching
mode of xMOOC, which is different from the early
cMOOC that is ‘based on the view of Knowledge
Construction Association’. But whether based on
the connectivism learning theory, or the currently
popular learning theory that emphasizes the con-
struction of learning significance, so the design
of the recommender systems must meet and pro-
mote such meaningful construction, and some
principles such as learner centred and empha-
sizing the creation of a learning environment
as well as an emphasis on collaborative learn-
ing and attention to feedback etc will be carried
out. For example, constructivism holds that the
construction of new knowledge is based on a pre-
viously completed knowledge structure network,
so the recommended system of learning resources
should be fully take into account this principle.

background will as one of the standards recom-
mended learning resources to help learners from
the original knowledge experience in the “growth”
of new knowledge and experience.
(2) Design the recommended system structure based
on the structure of MOOC
Wang Ping described the current mainstream
MOOC curriculum model, see Figure 1:
In Figure 1, the learning resources use the video
instruction, but it can contain other forms as an
auxiliary. We believe that any course should have
its own knowledge structure, and the video shows
the structural fragments. In addition, each video
is corresponding to a point of knowledge, and
all the knowledge points from a concept map. For
the introduction of an auxiliary learning process,
this knowledge can continue to diffuse outwards
and extend from other knowledge points which
can be the basic original knowledge of the prin-
ciple and the original historical as well as an
example and the recent development situation
etc. Similarly, it also can be in parallel with the
original knowledge. All knowledge points consti-
tute an extension of the concept map to combine
into the core of curriculum knowledge system.
A collection of knowledge points constitute the
recommended space of the recommender system
(or a part of the recommender space), accordingly.
As an important basis for making the recom-
mended decision, the structure of the concept map
alsoneedstobeabsorbedintherecommendedsys-
tem. In addition, the logical structure of MOOC
course and the link connection with the course
Web page and the curriculum content of the logic
distribution in the database will also become the
basis for system’s design.
(3) With context-aware recommender technology to
drive the engine’s system.
Traditional recommender system in User – Item in
two space dimensions try to on those who have not
yet been scoring “user-item on” calculation of score
function R:
As to the education recommended system, the “goods”
is the knowledge points that recommended by the
system to the user. This score is an ordered digital
symbol of user preference degree. R can be regarded
as a partial function, namely the combination of some
user * item that has not yet been given a determined
score (that is to say not know the evaluation of the
corresponding items of the user), which need to use
collaborative filtering (or other technologies) to esti-
mate. Once the R of the entire user * article space are
established, then some items of the highest score can
be a recommender to each user.
Context aware recommender technology will be the
environmental information as the third party to join
at the recommender space, Verbert[19] argues that the
context aware recommender system, used for mod-
elling and predicting user preferences through con-
textual information, and combined effectively, can be
more accurately inferred using behaviour to improve
the recommender satisfaction. The corresponding
score function can be expressed as
In the MOOC environment, objects can be mapped
into knowledge points, and the scores can be directly
or indirectly the score of users for learning resources
(such as whether to watch, watch, watch long times etc
converted into digital score), in addition, the situation
can be mapped into a hierarchy or multidimensional
variables, of which the contents should include the use
of learning characteristics and including from the start
the description of the learning model and the concept’s
map content.
At present, the context-aware recommender tech-
nology is one of the key research subjects in the
personalized recommender system, although, it is sub-
ject to form a unified algorithm for the diversity of
its context. There are some mainstream algorithm
structures, such as context pre filtering, context after
filtering, and context modelling, etc [20]. Based on
those algorithm building the recommender system can
improve the user’s satisfaction.
3.2
System design and planning
Based on the above ideas, the design planning of the
educational recommended system is as follows:
(1) Research in the MOOC is of particular signifi-
cance and for the user needs from the perspective
of education;
95

Compared with other learning environments,
the characteristics of MOOC is very obvious, such
as learner differences being very large, with learn-
ing content fragmented, and a high degree of free-
dom to learn, and teacher exchange opportunities
small, etc. This leads to the needs of personal-
ized learning support and the learning construct as
well as interaction skills in difficulties with learn-
ers. With the learner at the centre improvement
methods of education for the above difficulties
can be put forward, thus forming an analysis of
educational recommender system requirements.
(2) The construction of an educational recommender
systemframework,basedonamaturee-commerce
recommender system.
In the field of electronic commerce, the person-
alized recommender system technology is mature
and widely applied, which can be used as a source
of technology for the educational recommender
system. However the special educational environ-
ment makes it impossible to copy the e-commerce
recommender system as an application and a pro-
found transformation must be carried out. The
current research trend of the personalized rec-
ommender system, context-aware recommender
system based on user context to recommend, gives
full consideration to the outside position of a user
and recommender items of environmental infor-
mation. Thus, it is suitable for the technology as a
basis for educational recommender system; since
the definition of the context itself was too broad,
so context awareness technology also presents the
characteristics of diversification in view of the
teaching situation, especially the MOOC context
to explore the corresponding recommender tech-
nology, which will become the core content of the
subject.
(3) Combinedwiththeformofdesign,theeducational
recommender system and MOOC completes the
system’s scheme;
The educational recommender system must be
embedded into the MOOCWeb page, with a seam-
less integration into the network courses. Between
the MOOC curriculum and recommender system
are to promote mutual relations, such as the rec-
ommender system requires MOOC to record the
learning process perfectly, providing for basic data
for calculating similarity of users; otherwise the
curriculum team learning tasks and mutual evalu-
ation and mutual aid activities also needs that the
recommender system provides the best members
combination and score with partner. The imple-
mentationoftheeducationalrecommendersystem
needs to apply the network technology. In addi-
tion, we must consider the user experience, speed,
recommender time, and recommender user inter-
action, which are closely linked issues.This article
was readying to referent context teaching design
skills. In the meantime, it referent commercial rec-
ommender system human-computer interaction
experience structural prototype system. Finally, it
gradually improved design experience by the user
to complete this part of the work.
The specific design process can be divided into
three steps:
a. Research on MOOC teaching characteristics, are
needed to understand the needs of learners. From
the point of view of pedagogy education research
the recommender system should achieve the effect
and take the form of recommendations, in order to
format the demands of the analysis report.
b. As the goal of the current mainstream courses
products, for example Coursera, edX, and Udac-
ity, to analysis of MOOC system architecture and
combining form with the recommender system. To
complete the overall design and implementation of
educational recommender system.
c. Through trial operation for evaluation and improve-
ment of the educational recommender system, a
mature design scheme and implementation of the
program for the educational recommender system
can be formatted.

THE KEY PROBLEMS OF THE DESIGN OF
THE EDUCATIONAL RECOMMENDER
SYSTEM FOR MOOC
4.1
Grasp the particularity of an MOOC learning
situation, seek an innovative design that make a
breakthrough in traditional recommender
thinking
In detail, it can be divided into three aspects as follows:
a. Using a novel recommended way complete a rec-
ommendation of learning partners. In the envi-
ronment of MOOC, learning partners have an
‘accompany’ function, in addition, it must also be
borne in part a ‘guide’ function; So it results in
the significant difference that in the user is found
between the educational recommender system and
the traditional commercial recommender system;
First of all, the commercial recommender system
hope to find the most similar to the current user, and
predict the current user purchase behaviour; How-
ever, the educational recommender system wants
to find the learning level close to but slightly
higher than the user to provide “scaffolding” guid-
ance and help with the user, which conforms to
the educational concept of ‘the zone of proximate
development’. Courses in a Shanghai sharing cen-
tre’s data show that students in online learning will
lead to polarization, some people feel just like a
fish in water, others are not just as one wishes [18];
For the latter, which is obviously inappropriate to
recommend a learning partner who also backward.
b. In contrast to the traditional viewpoint, the learners
will be integrated into the recommender process,
which integrate into the design pattern and the
degree needing to elaborate. The commercial rec-
ommender system generally does not require the
96

user to participate in the recommender process (that
is to make the evaluation results recommender to
help improve the quality of recommendation), and
the user also did not participate in the power. How-
ever, the educational recommender system require
learners to participate actively in the recommender
system, and it has two advantages: The first is to
increase the system interaction, and “interactive”
is what MOOC has been advocating the behaviour,
so it is in line with the learning as a building
and cooperation activities of spirit; The second, the
performance of the recommender system can be
evaluated explicitly. Different from the commer-
cial recommender system can evaluate by the user
of purchase rate, what is difficult to obtain similar
evaluation, however, learners’ feedback to fill this
gap.
c. Using the characteristic of pedagogy “situation”
as the recommender foundation. The subject will
use the “context aware recommender technology”
as the core algorithm, and the “situation” can gen-
erally be understood as any information depicting
the entity characteristic.The recommender systems
context contain the user’s educational background,
age and other demographic information. in addi-
tion, the educational characteristics of learners’
learning style and learning object concept map will
constitute the core content of insinuation.
4.2
Gets the user fully trust in the recommender
system
Education recommendation system as a freshman
affairs for the majority of people are familiar with
it, and the active service characteristics are similar to
push advertising, so it may be causeed the user rejec-
tion, especially when the recommended time error. At
present there is no good way to improve user trust
degree of ascension, but we can proceed from the
following several aspects:
a. To determine the recommender principles and rec-
ommend depth by studying the recommender expe-
rience of the mature recommender system; and
recommender criteria of existing commercial rec-
ommender system can be used for reference, such
as a useful recommendation (mufti recommender
only in the alternative items) and one reason to
recommend (given a suitable reason of recom-
mendation to improve user trust) as well as based
on the social network of friends recommendation
(user-based recommendation), those recommender
criteria all can be transplanted to the research.
b. To determine the recommender time on the basis of
MOOC curriculum content difficulty distribution.
Obviouslyweshouldbebasedonthecharacteristics
of the course to determine using the recommender
plan. With the help of course designers to provide a
“degree of difficult or easy map” to trigger pre-
set recommender; in addition, adopt the way of
looking for the recommender time with dynamic
monitoring, such as learners stay repeatedly in one
knowledge point, or long time no mouse operation,
which may be the best time to recommend.
c. To adjust the recommender mechanism basis of
learner feedback to dynamically.That is the learner
containment strategy. Form of elaborate design rec-
ommender system to adjust learners of positive
emotion with lively, humanized page and language
of expression.

CONCLUSIONS
This article has discussed the MOOC educational rec-
ommender system’s design, and explained the idea of
the design and the important points that need atten-
tion and discussion. Although that are not provided a
consummately recommended system case., based on
those basis, it can achieve close corresponding recom-
mendation system practical combined with curriculum
combined with the specific MOOC courses.
A new form of teaching needs a new tutoring style
to match, which is the starting point for designing this
recommended education system. Because of the need
to learn the powerful auxiliary functions, the design
of the control system in the technical level is more
complex, if appropriate to reduce the requirements,
then the technology can greatly reduce the difficulty;
and the education recommended system need Closely
integrated with the lecture content and teaching style
of teacher, so it can be process of modular design of the
system, frame good system structure, by the MOOC to
complete the construction of the main teaching content
filling and knowledge network to “design guide” form,
to complete the implementation process of the system.

Creating a new computer education system in engineering higher education
Yuan Liu & Lihua Guo
School of Information Science and Engineering, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China
ABSTRACT:
This article reviews the origin of engineering education and the progress of engineering education
in China. Then, by taking the civil engineering specialty in the Fujian University of Technology as an example,
the importance of utilizing computer technology to create distinctive instructional resources in engineering
education is illustrated, and a new computer education system for non-computer majors is presented. The new
all-round college computer education reform requires efforts from all sides.
1
GENERAL INTRODUCTION
1.1
Origin of engineering education
The origin of engineering education can be traced
back to the “Apprenticeship” implemented by west-
ern countries and their associated industries in the
11th century. Since the Bourbon dynasty of France
created a civil engineering school in 1747, engineer-
ing education has been developed for more than 260
years up until now. The purpose of engineering educa-
tion established by a country is to cultivate talents for
industry development in one’s own country, so that the
comprehensive national power can be strengthened by
economic development.
International higher engineering education went
through three phases, the original phase, oriented to
engineering practice, the transition phase deviating
from practice, and the surpassing phase returning to
engineering practice. Nowadays, international engi-
neering education is situated in the “returning to
engineering practice” phase. However, it is not simply
returning back, instead it spiral developed to modern
engineering practice.
1.2
The training goal of higher engineering
education
Engineering is the extension and recreation of science;
contemporary engineers must be capable of transform-
ing science into technology and then transforming
technology into productivity. By taking the subject of
technology as the principal subject, and catering to the
practice application of a project, higher engineering
education aims for training engineers that are adept
in transforming science into productivity to adapt to
the developing industries of society and science tech-
nology. The US National Academy of Engineering
suggested the following qualities for being an engineer
by the year 2020:
• Analytical skills
• Practical ingenuity
• Creativity
• Business and management principles
• Leadership
• High ethical standards
• Sense of professionalism
• Dynamism, agility, resilience, and flexibility
1.3
Development of engineering education in China
At the beginning of the foundation of the PRC, China
followed the Soviet Union model, and then engineer-
ing education developed quickly by connecting theory
with practice. The “combining education with pro-
ductive labour” policy was brought in in 1958, which
promoted the development of engineering education.
In the 1960s, Chinese college students who majored
in engineering took part in not only experimental
tuition, but also took part in enterprise productive
recognition,metalworkingpractice,enterpriseproduc-
tive practice, etc.
A long time after China carried out its reform and
open policy, engineering education had been leap-
forward developed. In 1980, the Ministry of Education
modified the training objectives for undergraduate
education from cultivating engineers to cultivating stu-
dents that obtain the basic training of an engineer. The
transformation emphasized on solid subject founda-
tion other than specialty. It was the signal of deviating
from practice.
99

1.4
The deviating and the returning of engineering
education in China
The “deviating from practice” phase in China was later
than in Occident. In 1990s, Chinese engineering edu-
cation found itself still in the “deviating from practice”
phase, when the international engineering education
had been developed to the “returning back to practice”
phase.
In 2010, “China’s Medium- and Long-Term Talent
Development Plan (2010-2020)” and “Plan for Edu-
cating and Training Outstanding Engineers” (PETOE)
were published by the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and the State Council.
PETOE was a reform programme implemented in
selected units. This plan aimed to explore the ways
in which colleges cooperate with enterprises to train
talents, and it expanded the spread of engineering
education.
After the start of PETOE, many industry associ-
ations, local governments, enterprises, and colleges
worked together and made huge progress in the quality
of China’s engineering education. The new school-
enterprise cooperation training mode was established.
It improved students’ engineering practice ability,
engineering design ability, and engineering innovation
ability. As a result, the graduates were well received
at various enterprises. At the International Engineer-
ing Alliance Meeting held on June 19th 2013, China
was approved to become theWashingtonAccord’s 21st
contracting party.
1.5
Various international recognition agreements
In order to satisfy the needs of economic globaliza-
tion and the mobility of international talents, some
countries such as America began to build an interna-
tionalrecognitionsystemofengineeringeducationand
engineering technicians in the 1980s. It involved the
standardizing of engineering education and continuing
education, the certification of engineer qualifications,
and authentication of educational background, etc.
The six agreements included in the system can be
divided into two levels. The “Washington Accord”,
the “Sydney Accord”, and the “Dublin Accord” aim
for the mutual recognition of engineering education
and technique education. The “Engineer Mobility
Forum”, the “Asia-Pacific Engineer Agreement”, and
the “Engineering Technologist Mobility Forum” aim
for a certified qualification of the related engineering
technique.
The Washington Accord is the most influential
mutual recognition agreement for engineering under-
graduate degrees. It aims to promote engineers work
in different countries by the mutual recognition of
an engineering education or engineering qualification
certification. The standard of engineering education
and engineering qualification certification proposed
by the accord is the authoritative requirement for an
engineering graduate and engineer. The participation
of China in the Washington Accord illustrated the
approval of China’s engineering education quality in
an international society.
Participation in the Washington Accord will pro-
mote standards for the cultivation of talents in China
which are equal to the standards of the accord. After
that, colleges and enterprises will be connected tightly.
So it is helpful for improving China’s engineering
education level and the overall strength of China’s
engineering manufacture.

UTILIZE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN
ENGINEERING EDUCATION
2.1
Civil engineering specialty at the Fujian
University of Technology
We will take the civil engineering specialty at the
Fujian University of Technology as the example in
the following sections. The Fujian University of Tech-
nology (FJUT) is a new provincial college created
in 2002, which is now devoted to becoming an out-
standing and distinctive engineering-based Applied
University. The civil engineering major of the FJUT
is a national-level characteristic specialty, and also
is the initial national-level pilot reform specialty. By
utilizing computer technology and following progres-
sive engineering education principles, an in-depth
school-enterprise cooperation model was created dur-
ing the talents-training reform. The model was carried
out successfully during the 2010-2013 graduate edu-
cation major in civil engineering, achieving a full
employment rate and specialty counterpart rate.
The “Innovation and practice of in-depth school-
enterprise cooperation model for civil engineering
specialty” programme achieved the second class
reward of the national teaching achievement reward.
The civil engineering specialty passed the undergrad-
uate education appraise assessed by the Higher Educa-
tion Appraisal Committee of the Housing and Urban-
Rural Development Ministry. The validity period is
three years, from May 2014 to May 2017.
2.2
Utilize computer technology to create
distinctive instructional resources
The four-year training programme for civil engineer-
ing specialty offers students comprehensive devel-
opment of moral qualities, intellectual ability, and
physical fitness to serve for the modern civil con-
struction of the “Economic Zone on the West Side of
the Straits”, and also offers students general training
of being an registered engineer and innovative practi-
cal advanced engineering specialty talents. Graduates
can be engaged in construction and management of
civil engineering projects with primary project plan-
ninganddesigningability.Graduatesarealsoqualified
forprojectconstructionandmanagementjobsinbuild-
ing construction, municipal engineering, road bridge
engineering, railway track engineering, etc.
100

The multimedia courseware developed by the
school-enterprise cooperation integrates pictures and
video with 3D animation. It is more advanced, visual,
and diverse, because it combines the course content
with engineering practice to solve the obscurity of
some specialty courses such as construction tech-
nology, and it also solves the problems of outdated
textbooks. The “Building Construction” courseware
was demonstrated at many national conferences with a
favourable reception. The “Construction Organization
of Civil Engineering” teaching courseware won the
first-class award in the National Multimedia Materials
Contest for Civil Engineering Education.
The software developed by schools and enterprise
together can be generally used in tuition and con-
structionproduction,includingtemplatesoptimization
design, scaffold design, temporary electricity design,
construction plan design, quality acceptance, sched-
ule control, investment control, safety management,
civilized construction management, etc. The software
can be helpful for students to solve the problem of
project construction scheme designing, and work out
solutions during the curriculum design or the gradua-
tion project. In this way, students can master the skills
for project construction scheme designing and imple-
mentation in order to get a better job later.The software
has been applied in the tuition for seven years and also
in hundreds of construction enterprises. The software
developed for tuition and production both narrows the
gap between theory and practice. This achievement
won the third prize for technology award in Fujian.
A quality and safety supervision simulation system
was developed to simulate the multilevel examination
and approval process in different roles. It demonstrates
advanced construction techniques by 3D animation,
which encourages students to learn obscure techniques
through vivid animation. By using this system, stu-
dents can simulate an on-the-spot inspection of an
observation record in the construction site, and esti-
mate deviation according to the regulations. Also
students can virtually simulate construction workers
to check the observation records, simulate a project
manager to examine and approve construction qual-
ity or safety examination materials, simulate party
A to review, and simulate designers to review the
engineering project or conduct a sign procedure.

CREATE A NEW COMPUTER EDUCATION
SYSTEM FOR NON-COMPUTER MAJORS
3.1
Motivation of the new computer education
reform
Since the 1980s, computer education for non-
computer majors has been developed over the three
decades. After the study and practice of generations
of experts and instructors, computer education theory
for non-computer majors has been developed step by
step, and a curriculum system of computer education
for undergraduates has been created as a consequence.
The initial computer foundation education mainly
treated the computer as a tool for mastering com-
puter basic knowledge and techniques. The concept
of a computer culture was brought up in the 1990s
and increased the universality of computer educa-
tion. Nowadays, with the popularization of informa-
tion technology in elementary and secondary schools,
many first-year university students know computer
operation techniques well, so it is necessary to promote
a new computer education reform.
According to the “Washington Accord”, a certifi-
cation validity period can be provided. For example
the validity period for the civil engineering specialty
in FJUT is from May 2014 to May 2017. Various
techniques will be updated during the three years.
Therefore, we have to train college student majors in
engineering to be more flexible, and prepare them for
the next engineering education assessment.
3.2
The features of new all-round college computer
education reform
Computer education for undergraduates has been
developed with continuous reform.The new round col-
lege computer education reform proposed here shows
significant breakthrough and evolution compared to
the current education model. Following the principle
of cultivating students’ abilities, the essence of abili-
ties can be changed and developed greatly. It breaks
through the computer science field, and achieves uni-
versal computing thinking and practical abilities to
solve problems.
The functions of a college computer education
have significantly changed, along with the essence
of changing abilities. They are not to be limited to
solving the problems within computer fields, but can
also solve problems of various specialties and solve
issues in real life by computing thinking and practice.
It is a novel feature of the new all-round college com-
puter education reform.And the developing of science
thoughts including computational thinking was also a
novel contribution to computer education.
“Computational Thinking” was a concept put for-
ward by American scholars in the 1990s. Professor
Jeannette M. Wing, in America, gave a comprehen-
sive definition of computational thinking in 2006; it
is the basic quality with which to solve a problem.
So, computational thinking can be integrated into a
new all-round college computer education to improve
students’ thinking ability.
3.3
Create a curriculum system oriented to
computer application ability
Computer education for engineering education must
be categorized, not only by different subjects, but by
different college directions in China, as well.
Computer education for undergraduates must be
application oriented, and meet the specialty needs.The
101

ability.
computer related courses must be provided continu-
ously during the four-year college study, and must be
deepened step by step.
The new curriculum system may include a profes-
sional level and a universal level.
The Professional level (first level) can be divided
into the foundation, technique, and application levels.
The Universal level (second level) is a level to help
the integration of thought and action. Courses are non-
essential in the second level; we can only train students
by integrating some courses of the first level. From
the non-computer major’s perspective, computer tech-
niques can be divided into calculation techniques, data
techniques, network techniques, and design technique
domains. Utilizing the latest computer techniques to
update the course materials is very important.
The civil engineering specialty at the FJUT pro-
vide a “3.3 plus 0.7” training programme which
requires students to perform computer-aided design
and computer-aided management tasks. Therefore, we
can create a curriculum system as follows. In the
first year, computer foundation and object-oriented
programming language courses can be provided for
students to learn about the development of com-
puter techniques, master information retrieval skills,
solve practical problems with programming language,
and pass the second-level of the Computer Rank
Examination for universities in Fujian. In the sec-
ond year, combined with civil engineering cartography
and building architecture courses, basic drawing and
editing functions of the popular computer graphics
software, AutoCAD, can be taught. Students can learn
how to draw engineering graphs, and master several
mobile applications. In the third year, courses such as
Advanced Computer Aided Design (CAD) of Build-
ing, Principles of Concrete, Structure Design courses
etc, can be offered. Students can learn the popular
functions of several CAD soft wares and master sev-
eral simulate software. The skilled students or those
who are interested may also join the school-enterprise
team to develop software together.
Finally, in the fourth year, students will be encour-
aged to take part in engineering practice, so that the
application of computer-aided design in graduate pro-
grammes will be enhanced, and students’ computer
application levels will be improved.
To satisfy the needs of the curriculum system,
the supporting textbooks have to be provided. Text-
books are important for the achievement of education
thought and the tuition requirements, and also are
an important fundamental construction of education
reform. Besides bringing in some outstanding foreign
computer textbooks, the textbook system has to be
thoroughly designed according to the needs of Chinese
students who are non-computer majors.The textbooks
have to be scientific, gradually improved, progressive,
and accessible for students’ active learning.
The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) was
an education revolution launched by Silicon Valley
in 2011. The course videos of the MOOC are short,
lasting from a few minutes to more than ten minutes,
according to the fragmentation feature of reading in
the network era. The courses in the MOOC have many
quizzes; students have to answer these to continue with
the course. If students have questions about the course,
they can post on the course forum to ask for help from
anyone all over the world.
Learning from the model of the MOOC, the Uni-
versity Open Online Courses (UOOC) Alliance was
created by local colleges in May 2014. Fujian Univer-
sity ofTechnology was invited to join in the alliance in
September 2014. The UOOC Alliance integrates the
high-quality tuition resources of local colleges so that
superior courses can be shared, tuition and learning
methods are enriched, higher education is developed
and balanced, and the training level and serving abil-
ity of college talents are improved. There are sixty
colleges joined in the alliance so far, involving thirty-
eight cities all around China.The “College Computer”
course provided by Shenzhen University is one of the
initial online courses.
In brief, the computer industry is developing rapidly
nowadays; the urgent need for outstanding engineer-
ing talents is increasing in countries gradually, so the
creation of a new college computer education system
for non-computer majors is not only an opportunity,
but also a challenge.

CONCLUSIONS
Engineering education has been developing for years,
leading to more rational hierarchical structures, var-
ious training objectives for talents, and a more
optimized training system for engineering technique
talents. The application of computer techniques to
engineering education practice helps interdisciplinary
engineering talent to possess an international perspec-
tive. The new all-round college computer education
reform requires effort from all sides. Not only do all
the related teachers need to upgrade their perspectives,
improve their abilities, and become actively involved
in the reform, but also the leaders and administra-
tive departments of colleges, the related governments,
and industries have to pay more attention to the
reform. In this era of rapid information development,
by strengthening the researches and formulating the
102

related policies, the new college computer education
reform will play a more important role in engineering
education progress.

Correlations between learning networks and academic performance
Q. Zhao, K. Zhao, D.S. Zhao & J. Yang
College of Modern Educational Technology, Northwest University for Nationalities, Lanzhou, Gansu, China
ABSTRACT:
This paper investigates the correlations between learning networks (network topology, network
structure, and network properties) and academic performance. We analysed a learning network comprised of 204
students at the Northwest University for Nationalities. We found that indegree is positively related to English
performance, and betweenness is positively related to computer performance. We came to the conclusion that in
learning networks, the students who have a high-level of indegree or betweenness, play a very important role in
communication between students, they can affects academic performace of students each other.
1
INTRODUCTION
Social networks have attracted considerable interest
in recent years, largely because of their contribution
to human understanding of various social structures
and processes, such as information processing (Dodds,
Watts & Sabel, 2003), distributed search (Kleinberg,
2000), and diffusion of social influence (Valente,
1995). There are mainly two branches of the studies of
social networks: the static features of network topolo-
gical structures, and the dynamical evolving processes
measured from some network generation models.
Social learning theory (Vygotsky 1978; Wenger 1998)
suggests that learning takes place during social inter-
action and in social contexts. Learning networks, are
one kind of social network composed by students in
the process of learning and there is a relatively small
amount of research on learning networks so far.
To realize the relationship between the topological
features of a learning network and academic perfor-
mance, can improve students’ academic performance
and optimize the structure of learning networks. Social
Network Analysis (SNA) (Serrat, 2010) is a method
with increasing application in the social sciences and
has been applied in areas as diverse as psychology,
health, business organization, and electronic commu-
nications. More recently, interest has grown in the
analysis of leadership learning networks to sustain
and strengthen their relationships within and across
groups, organizations, and related systems. In addi-
tion, in this paper we also use SNA to study the
correlation between topological features (betweenness
closeness, clustering coefficient indegree and outde-
gree) of learning networks and academic performance
(common courses in English and computer studies).

RELATED WORKS
The social network approach holds that the behaviour
of an individual is affected by the kinds of relations,
or technical ties, and networks, more than by the
norms and attributes that an individual possesses. The
social, informational, or material resources, that two
individuals exchange characterize their ties. In social
network analysis, these resource exchanges are termed
“relations.” Some positive and negative relations are
assumed to be related to an individual’s performance.
Researchers empirically demonstrated that friendship
and advice relations were positively related to a stu-
dent’s academic performance and an employee’s job
performance. On the other hand, the effects of an
adversarial network were negatively related to perfor-
mance (Baldwin, Bedell & Johnson, 1997; Sparrowe,
Liden & Kraimer, 2001).
SNA has also been applied in community stud-
ies to investigate the social relationships and pat-
terns that evolve through member interactions (Cho,
Lee, Stefanone & Gay, 2005; Haythornthwaite, 2002;
Reffay & Chanier, 2002). The application of SNA to
community studies typically involves an investigation
into the types of resources exchanged, their frequency,
quantity, and flow, in order to describe the elements
comprising the social system (Haythornthwaite &
Wellman, 1998). For example, Reffay and Chanier
(2003) incorporated SNA to describe relationships and
interactions occurring among students and staff partic-
ipating in computer-supported collaborative learning.
The authors maintained that the use of SNA provides
an opportunity to gauge the communicative interac-
tions that take place, and to assess the degree of cohe-
sion within the group. Girvan and Newman (2002)
have drawn similar conclusions regarding the appli-
cability of SNA to ascertain the degree and strength
of social ties developed within a social system in
developing models of community structures.
A great deal of work in SNA focuses on the perfor-
mance of the individual in the social networks, the
evolution of the social network, network structure,
and so on. In addition, aside from a comparatively
small number of studies are about, network topology

structure characteristics, such as betweenness, close-
ness, clustering, and degree distribution, which relate
to academic performance, that prompts our passion for

DATA DESCRIPTION
3.1
Data
Inthis study, we gathereddataonthelearningnetworks
of all first-year undergraduate students in the College
of Modern Educational Technology at the Northwest
UniversityforNationalitiesduringthefirstsemesterof
the academic year 2011–2012. The group of selected
students consists of 204 students with 3 majors, and
each major contains 2 classes.
All students were asked to complete the learn-
ing network questionnaire, which provided a student
roster containing a list of their names. The students
choose them with two items, “schoolmate”, and “non-
schoolmate.” The students were asked to fill ques-
tionnaires out in 45 minutes. Questionnaires were
presentedtothestudentsafteramonthofthementering
the university. The corresponding learning networks

were indicated by L1. We also linked the learning net-
work data to teaching administrative data in order to
acquire the academic performance of the first semester
academics. This allowed us to analyse the correlations
between learning network and academic performance
(English performance and computer performance).

Topological features
We measured L1’s betweenness, closeness, degree dis-
tribution, and clustering spectrum. The results gave us
the clues as to how the learning network is formed.
1) Betweenness: betweenness of the learning network
is shown in Figure 1. The blue curve is drawn
according to the observed learning network data.
2) Closeness: closeness of the learning network is
shown in Figure 2. The blue curve is drawn accord-
ing to the observed learning network data.
3) Degree distribution: in our study, the learning
network link is directed, therefore the degree dis-
tribution of the learning network has InDegree dis-
tribution and OutDegree distribution, respectively,
shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In Figure 3, the blue
curve is drawn according to the observed learning

DATA ANALYSIS
In this section, we use R to compute the correla-
tion between topology characteristics and academic
performance.
4.1
Correlation matrix
To analyse the level of closeness between objective
things with appropriate statistical indicators, that is
correlatively analysed. In order to more accurately
describe the level of linear correlation between the
variables, the correlation coefficient for correlation
analysis can be counted. The correlation coefficient
is an important indicator which can indicate the level
of correlation. The correlation matrix in our statistics
is shown in Table 1.
4.2
Probability values
P-value is probability. It reflect the probability of an
event occurring. In statistics, p-value is the important
basis of hypothesis testing. p-values in our statistics
are shown in Table 2.

Correlation
The correlation between topological features and aca-
demic performance is shown in Figure 6. We begin
to explain these graphics from the lower triangu-
lar cell (below the main diagonal cells). In the blue
cell, the slash where the lower-left cell points to the
upper-right cell, indicates that the two variables were
positively correlated. In turn, the red cell, upper-
left point to the lower-right representing a negative
correlation. The deeper the colour, the greater the cor-
relation between the variables. Pie chart of triangular
cell (upper the main diagonal cells) shows the same
information. Colour function is the same above, the
bigger the size of the pie, the greater the correla-
tion between the variables. Positive correlation fill pie
clockwise from 12 o’clock, while a negative correla-
tion fill pie the counter-clockwise. In these graphics,
we can seeindegree and English have a positive corre-
lation. Betweenness and computer also have positively
correlation with each other.
4.4
Students in the real world
In order to study the correlations between topological
features and academic performance better, we investi-
gated the real social relationship with a high-level of
indegree in the collegeSurvey result is shown in Table
3.The students with a high-level of indegree are mostly
cadres of the Student’s Union or cadres of a class, who
have a significant effect on communication between
students. They maybe have an influence on various
aspects of the learning network, including academic
performance.

CONCLUSION
In the university campus, a learning network may be
the most basic relationship of their social networks.
In this paper, we research the correlations between
topological features of learning networks, which are
composed of students from the Northwest University
for Nationalities and academic performance (English
performance and computer performance). Accurately,
we respectively calculate the correlations between
betweenness, closeness, clustering coefficient, inde-
gree, and outdegree, and English performance and
computer performance. According to the correlations
analysis, we found that indegree and English show a
positive correlation, and betweenness and computer
also positively correlated with each other. It sug-
gests students, who have a high-level of indegree
or betweenness, play a very important role in the
academic performance of learning networks.

boring science courses, innovatively, so that changes are made to the traditional teaching methods with images,
text, sound, and video, disseminating rich information in a lively, fun, and artistic way. Zinemaker software is used
to design and develop the magazine in the field of antennas. Electronic magazine contains images, text, sound,
video, and other multimedia elements, and displays the evolution, classification, and application of antennas in
a lively and informative way. By way of example, electronic magazine’s cover, table of contents, and various
components and features are introduced.
Keywords:

INTRODUCTION
Electronic magazine, abbreviated as E-zine, also
called network magazine or interactive magazine, has
the characteristics of plane media and internet. E-zine
combines text, images, sound, and video information
andcontainshyperlinksandtimelyinteractionnetwork
elements as well, in a very enjoyable reading mode[1].
An antenna and radio wave propagation course is
a very important practical professional course with
abstract and complex theory in communication engi-
neering and electronic information engineering spe-
cialties.The course covers the theoretical research and
design application of antennas and radio waves, and
dozens of different categories of antennas that are
widely used in the field of wireless communication
are discussed. In order to enrich teaching contents
and expand the horizons of students, the electronic
magazine media form is combined with the antenna
curriculum firstly, which changes the traditional teach-
ing methods in science and engineering courses, with
a large number of images, texts, sounds and videos,
and that disseminates rich information in a lively and
artistic way to improve the interest of students[2−3].

E-ZINE FEATURES
E-zine is a kind of machine reading magazine, which
can give full play to the advantages of computing
speed and mass storage of the computer to increase the
amount of information greatly, and find contents in the
ocean of information with the computer specific query
functionality, quickly. Moreover, with more forms of
multimedia people cannot only see text and pictures,
but can also hear all kinds of sounds and see moving
images. E-zine has good extension that can be trans-
planted to a variety of personal terminals such as PDA,
MOBILE, MP4, PSP, andTV (digitalTV, set-top box),
etc. The page turning effect of E-zine is more lifelike
than an e-book, and the appearance of E-Magazine’s
user interface is more stereo than a PDF and webpage
interface.
3
APPLICATION OF E-ZINE IN TEACHING
E-zine has the characteristics of exciting content, page
turning effect, navigation buttons, link addresses, and
more rich audio-visual elements to attract readers and
promote active attention into passive attention. The
advantages of E-zine can be applied to design teach-
ing practice and enrich the traditional teaching method
with new technological elements, in order to attract
learners using the wealth of learning resources to
participate in thoughtful discussions efficiently[4].
E-zine broadens the horizons of learners, and
attracts learners to participate with the vivid and rich
learning environment. With the popular PPT (Power-
Point) software in teaching, E-zine can produce a very
good complementary effect aiming at the writing on
the blackboard. When classroom-oriented, E-zine cre-
ates vivid scenes and promotes interaction between
teachers and students. Table 1 gives the comparison of
similarities and differences between E-zine and PPT.

Practical innovation about the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
in data structure teaching
Jing Yi, Sheng’en Li, Xiaobing Tang & Xiaofei Niu
School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan, China
ABSTRACT:
In the teaching of data structure, there are lots of problems including those of vague concepts,
abstract ideas, and non-concrete algorithms. How to solve these problems from a theoretical and practical point
of view is one of the troublesome tasks of teaching. Taking the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) as an example,
this paper introduces a method of case teaching with professional characteristics. During the learning process,
as well as learning how the algorithms work, the students have to also improve their original knowledge and
ability structure. This innovative practice teaching mode played a very good teaching effect.
1
INTRODUCTION
Trees and graphs are the keystones and difficulties
of data structure teaching. Specially, it is very hard
for students to acquire knowledge about the concept
and application of graphs. To solve these problems to
attain teaching objectives, the basic theories and engi-
neering during the teaching process were combined
By taking case teaching method and graphic teaching
method; It makes the students to think positive under
the guidance of teacher. This article takes the Mini-
mum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph as an example
and combines the graphic teaching and practical teach-
ing. Meanwhile, it provides a teaching case with their
professional characteristics. It can not only make stu-
dents learn the content of MST, but also it can improve
their quality of overall problem-solving on a profes-
sional level as well. It will improve their cognitive level
of professional knowledge and make the structure of
knowledge perfect so as to achieve a better teaching
effect.

ANALYSIS OF CURRENT TEACHING CASE
2.1
Definition of the minimum spanning tree
In all the spanning trees with weighted graphs, the
spanning tree with the sum of the edges for the min-
imum cost is called the minimum spanning tree. Its
characteristics are as follows: (1) The edge number of
the minimum spanning tree edges is |V| −1 (V is the
vertices number of the weighted graph), (2) the min-
imum spanning tree is a tree structure with no ring,
and (3) the minimum spanning tree contains all the
vertices.
2.2
Analysis of current teaching case about the
minimum spanning tree
The theory of the minimum spanning tree is very
important in the teaching of data structure, which
is a typical application of combining the theory and
practice. There are many teaching cases about the
minimum spanning tree in documents, eg, literature
[1] enumerates some typical teaching cases in the
course of data structure, documents [2–4] uses the
road network planning problem as a teaching case for
the minimum spanning tree, that is, how to design a
minimum cost network which connects n cities.
Establishing a transportation network between n
city needs n −1 minimum edges. Possible lines
between n city traffic are up to 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · +
(n −1) = n*(n −1)/2. How to find the n −1 lines sav-
ing money most in the n*(n −1)/2 lines is the core
issue of solving this case. The basic idea to solve the
problem is as follows: Find n −1 lines costing the least
from possible lines, which is also equivalent to looking
for a minimum spanning tree network; choose n −1
edge (does not constitute a loop) in all the possible
e(n −1 ≤e ≤n*(n −1)/2) weighted edges and make
the weights of all chosen edges minimum.
The teaching case where highway network planning
saves money the most has the two following features:
(1) Easy understanding. The problem is clear at a
glance, easy to understand, and can guide students
to think actively, analyse, and then find a possible
solution to the problem;
(2) High pertinence. Abstract the possible link
between n cities for a network, use vertex to rep-
resent the city, the edge in the connected net
presents the boundary line between two cities,
and the weight on the edge of the net represents
113

the communication cost; such a transportation
network planning problem is equivalent to a even
lton-us minimum spanning tree problem.
This case can meet the basic conditions required
for teaching case, combined with the graphic method,
and can be easily understood and grasped by stu-
dents. However, through the teaching results, students
will still have questions after solving problems, for
example, a real traffic network, in order to bring
convenience to transportation, is often designed and
established in accordance with the network mode, not
in accordance with the minimum spanning tree finally
obtained. This phenomenon illustrates the teaching
case does not have good applicability. So, seeking bet-
ter teaching case becomes an important task in order
to strengthen the teaching effect.

TEACHING CASE WITH PROFESSIONAL
CHARACTERISTICS
3.1
Selection of teaching case
Minimum spanning tree is important and difficult in
the graph teaching of the data structure. The choice of
case is the core for the case teaching method. A excel-
lent teaching case can not only combine the practical
environment, but also can be understood easily. At the
same time, in the process of collecting case materi-
als, teaching case that is related with the professional
characteristics of students can make students combine
the learned data structure knowledge, and relate pro-
fessional knowledge effectively. As a result, students
can improve their original recognition structure in the
process of analysing and solving problems.
In accordance with the purpose of case selection,
we can find a teaching example based on campus
network planning: Taking the Shandong Jianzhu Uni-
versity area network planning as the example, it
takes the XINXI academic building (Network Center)
as the centre, connects several big teaching offices in
the campus, and discusses how to plan the campus
network.
3.2
Analysis of the teaching case
Taking the situation into account where students have
mastered the basic network knowledge before learning
the data structure, two kinds of solutions about design
of campus network can be obtained, that follows: tree
structure (as shown in Figure 1) and graph structure
(as shown in Figure 2).
The two campus network planning methods are
compared, and their characteristics are described in
Table 1.
So, the method of solving the planning campus net-
work is as follows: we can deploy the campus network
in redundancy wires, and can make use of the spanning
tree of the network to run the network. the problem of
planning campus network is, this is to say, a problem
to work out a minimum spanning tree in a connected
graph (shown in Figure 3).

Solution for the teaching case
There are two ways of obtaining the minimum span-
ning tree in a connected graph: the Kruskal algorithm
114

and Prim algorithm[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]; in the course of teach-
ing the algorithms, documents [5], [6] adopt the
illustration method. The author with the experience of
many years of teaching, explains the solving process
of the minimum spanning tree well using illustration
and multimedia animation and, at last, provides two
thoughts for the two algorithms.
The minimum spanning tree obtained by the
Kruskal algorithm is shown in Figure 4, and its core
thought is to add edges but not constitute a loop. Fig-
ure 4 shows the process for the minimum spanning tree
using the Kruskal algorithm (4.a–4.f).
ThepseudocodedescriptionforKruskal’salgorithm
is as follows:
1 CreateGraph(ST, n, 0)
2
k=0; i=1;
3
while( k<n-1 ) {
4
select a minimum-weight edge (u,v);
5
if (!isCircle(ST,u,v) {
6
addEdge(ST,u,v);
7
k++;
8
}
9
i++;
10
}
The minimum spanning tree obtained by Prim’s
algorithm is shown in Figure 5 and its core thought
is adding vertices and keeping the net connected. Fig-
ure 5 shows the process for the minimum spanning tree
using Prim’s algorithm (5.a–5.f)
The pseudocode description for Prim’s algorithm is
as follows:
1
addVerToCollection(v0,U);
2
while V-U̸=  {
115

3
select a minimum-weight edge (u,v);
//u comes from U, and v comes from V-U
4
add VerToCollection(v,U);
5
};
And finally, we conclude the shape of the minimum
spanning tree is not unique.
3.4
Summary and expansion about the
teaching case
We can obtain the detailed process for two algorithms
(Prim’s algorithm and the Kruskal algorithm) of the
minimum spanning tree in the teaching process by
introducing the teaching case of “the campus network;
how to plan and wire”, proposing the concept of a
minimum spanning tree, and combining the teaching
by way of illustration and multimedia animation. The
tested outcome of classroom has proved that 99% of
students easily understand and accept this problem,
and master it well.
We can conduct the case extension on the basis of
understanding and grasping the issues of the minimum
spanning tree, and then ask the question that “if a cir-
cuit (such as the edge <d, e>) breaks down, how will
the network run?” in order to guide students to draw the
conclusion that they can work out the new minimum
spanning tree through the algorithm of the minimum
spanning tree from the new figure after deleting the
edge <d, e>, so that the students can fundamentally
understand the rules of network operation and enrich
their original knowledge systems. Such a knowledge
point is the Spanning Tree ProtocolSTP) of the “Com-
puter Network”, which will be taught in the following
courses, and the extension of the teaching case plays
a connecting role in the teaching of these following
courses.

SUMMARY
Data structure is a very important specialized ele-
mentary course, which emphasizes both theory and
practice. Moreover, it plays an important role in teach-
ing the computer system. During teaching of the
students, we combined the student characteristics with

ABSTRACT:
In order to use radar images as cover images, whose noise level is higher than that of natural
images, we propose a steganographic method for radar images based on BEMD (Bi-dimensional Empirical
Mode Decomposition). First of all, we divide a cover radar image into many blocks, and we utilize the BEMD
to decompose every block into a set of IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Function), plus the residue. Then, we calculate the
texture strength of a block via all the IMFs’ coefficients. Namely, the hiding capacity is evaluated by the texture
strength. Finally, we embed the secret information into the cover radar image with modulus function-based
steganography. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed steganographic method provides a larger
hiding capacity and maintains a better visual quality of the stego-image.

INTRODUCTION
Since the 1990s, steganography has been a technique
for data protection, which is mainly used in the hid-
ing of communication[1]. Because there are many
images on the Internet, some people utilize certain
steganographic methods to hide secret information
within images, such as LSB (Least Significant Bit).
LSB is the most common method, but it embeds only
one bit into one pixel. That is to say, for a 256*256
image, only 65536 bits are embedded into this image.
Therefore, it has a small embedding capacity. To
enlarge the hiding capacity, modulus function-based
steganography[2] was proposed in 2003, which can
embed more bits into a pixel. However, not all pix-
els in an image can tolerate equal amounts of changes
without causing a noticeable distortion. The changes,
which occur in the texture and edge areas, can hardly
be noticed by human eyes, so scholars designed
steganographic methods to make use of HVSs (Human
Visual System), such as BPCS (Bit-plane Complexity
Segmentation)[3], PVD (Pixel-value Differencing)[4],
Side Match[5], andWCLSB[6] (Wavelet Contrast Least
Significant Bit). Using these steganographic methods,
more secret information is embedded in the texture and
the edge areas in images; less information is embedded
in smooth areas. For example, these methods embed
2–4 bits into one pixel. That is to say, for a 256*256
image, about 131072-262144 bits are embedded into
this image. Fortunately, the PSNR (Peak Signal to
Noise Ratio) of these methods are about 38–40 db.
Thus, we see that the hiding capacity of information is
greatly improved while the quality of visual impercep-
tibility is maintained. However, these methods utilize
the differences of neighbouring pixels to estimate the
human eye sensitivity, which does not make full use of
HVSs. Besides, these methods use the natural image
as the cover image, whose noise lever is lower and zero
at some times, and in these methods, the noise is not
considered. However, in radar images, the noise lever
is higher and can destroy the cover image at the same
time. Thus, these methods do not adapt to the radar
images.
At the end of the 1990s, Huang et al. developed
a novel data decomposition method as a novel sig-
nal analysis method for non-stationary and non-linear
signals, named the EMD (Empirical Mode Decom-
position). Different from the wavelet, the EMD can
decompose signals into a set of IMFs and obtain the
residue. Each IMF is the detail with a certain scale,
and the residue represents the approximation. Thus,
the EMD can be considered as a multi-resolution anal-
ysis method of a signal. Being an expansion of the
EMD method in the two-dimensional field such as the
image, the BEMD[7] (Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode
Decomposition) is a novel analytical method for image
multi-resolution. As we known, the multi-resolution
analysis is closely related to the human visual system.
Thus, we can use BEMD to build the HVS evaluated
function in this paper.
To embed more secret information into cover radar
images and make the radar images effectively robust
119

to noise, a novel steganographic method based on
BEMD and HVS is proposed in this paper, where the
radar images are adopted as the cover images. Since in
the radar images, the magnitude of the IMF’s coeffi-
cient can reflect the texture strength of images, we can
estimate the texture strength of each block according
to the sum of absolute value of all the IMF coeffi-
cients. Considering that human eyes are less sensitive
to the noise in a strong texture area than in a weak
one, we embed more secret information into stronger
texture areas. Besides, as we know, the performance
of the modulus-based steganography is best in all
steganographic methods where the HVS is not being
considered; we utilize it as the embedding method in
this paper.

STEGANOGRAPHY METHOD
BASED ON BEMD
Considering the fact that the radar image’s noise level
is higher than that of the natural images, we develop
a novel radar image steganography based on BEMD
and modulus function in this paper. First of all, a
cover radar image is divided into many blocks, and
every block is decomposed into a set of IMFs and
the residue with the BEMD. Then, we estimate the
texture strength.The texture strength of a block is eval-
uated by the sum of the absolute value of all the IMF
coefficients. As we know, the stronger the texture is,
the larger the hiding capacity is. Finally, the secret
information is embedded by modulus function-based
steganography, whose performance is very good. The
process includes the embedding method and extracting
method. The details are as follows:
2.1
Embedding method
The detailed secret data hiding steps are shown in
Figure 1. The process is as follows:
Step 1:The cover image is divided into blocks of equal
size, P ∗Q and then each block is decomposed into
a set of IMFs and the residue by BEMD.
Step 2: Calculate the texture strength of a block. In
these letters, we utilize the sum of the absolute value
of all the IMF coefficients in the block as the texture
strength of the block:
where Cj(x, y) is a coefficient of the j-th IMFs in the
block, and J is the number of IMFs.
Step 3: Obtain the modulus n according to the texture
strength. Determine the parameters nmin, nmax, and
, then calculate modulus n as Equation (2):
where nmin and nmax are the minimum and maximum
of n, respectively, and  is the quantization coeffi-
cient. From Equation (2), we can see that the larger S

is, the larger the modulus n is and n adopted by mod-
ulus function-based steganography is proportional to
the hiding capacity. This suggests that more secret
information is embedded into stronger texture areas.
Step 4: Embed additional and secret information into a
block using modulus function-based steganography.
According to a secret key, we choose a pixel from
the block, and embed the value of modulus n (the
additional information) into it by modulus function-
based steganography with modulus nmax + 1. Then,
by modulus function-based steganography with
modulus n, we embed floor(log2 (nP∗Q−1)) bits
secret information into other pixels in this block.
However, before we embed secret information into
the block, we should transform 2-base notational
secret information into an m-base notational one.
Step 5: Go to Step 2, until all blocks are processed.
2.2
Extracting method
We can retrieve secret information from the stego-
image as shown in the following steps:
Step 1: The stego-image was divided into blocks of
P ∗Q.
Step 2: According to a secret key, find the pixel
embedded with modulus n and extract the additional
information for a block.
Step 3: Secret information is extracted as Equation (4)
with modulus n.Then, secret information is converted
into a 2-base notational system. The pixel embedded
with modulus n need not to be extracted.
Step 4: Go to Step 2, until all blocks are processed.

REVIEW OF MODULUS STEGANOGRAPHY
The modulus function-based steganographic method
has the following virtues: (a) its SNR (Signal to Noise
Ratio) is high in all steganographic methods where the
HVS is not considered; (b) its embedding load is large;
it can embed 2–4 bits of secret information into one
pixel of the cover image. However, it has a weak point.
Namely, it does not make use of the HVS effectively,
and is sensitive to noise. We will use this method as a
step in the proposed method. It is described as follows.
Assume that k kinds of symbols are used in the
secret information.The digital system representing the
embedded secret information is: {0, 1, 2, . . . , k −1}.
Moreover, assume that the i-th data xi (0 ≤xi < k) is
embeddedintothepixelyi.Thus,thepixelyi ischanged
into y∗
i as follows:
where the value di can be presented as:
In a few cases, the y∗
i in Equation (3) may fall out-
side the range of [0, 255]. If that occurs, y∗
i is reset
using the following equation:
Extracting the data digit xi from y∗
i is very easy. Just
calculate as shown in Equation (6):

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Steganography security includes the perceptibility
security and the statistical security. The perceptibility
security is obtained when the human eye cannot notice
the distortion of the stego-image, while the statistical
security means that the steganalysis cannot detect the
secret information embedded within the image.
Next, we analyse the statistical security. On one
hand, the reader can determine five parameters. As
a result, steganalysis against our method must esti-
mate five parameters. As with BPCS, PVD, and SM,
each method has only one parameter to determine, and
designing steganalysis methods against these methods
is easy. However, our method has five parameters, and
designing steganalysis against our method becomes
difficult. On the other hand, the pixel into which the
modulus value of a block is embedded, is chosen by the
secretkey.Thus,anyonewhodoesnotknowtheparam-
eters and the secret key can hardly extract or detect the
secret information, and the steganalysis against our
method is defeated.
In this paper, the perceptibility security is analysed
through the simulation results.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this paper, we utilize fake stochastic sequence as
the secret information, and adopt 8, 8, 4, 11, and 3000
as the parameters P, Q, nmin, nmax, and , respec-
tively. To enhance steganographic security, the reader
can choose the parameters himself. Figure 2, Figure 3,
and Figure 4 show the simulation results for a radar
image of the Pentagon, abq apt, and isleta, respectively.
We cannot find the difference between the cover radar
image and the radar stego-image with our human eyes.

Figure 2(c), Figure 3(c), and Figure 4(c) are the differ-
ence images between the radar stego-images and the
cover radar images (with the differences of gray val-
ues being scaled 30 times). It can be seen that major
changes lie in the strong texture areas and the minor
changes lie in the weak texture areas. These results
suggest that good visual imperceptibility is obtained.
Then, we choose three test radar images (496×496)
for simulation in this paper, and the hiding capacity
and PSNR are shown in Table 1. From Table 1, we
can see that the hiding capacity is greater than 30%
of the size of the image (2.4 bits of secret information
in one pixel of the cover radar image), and all value-
sof PSNR (Peak of Signal-to-Noise Ratio) are higher
than 38 db.As we know, when the PSNR is higher than
38 db, the human eye canhardlynoticethedistortionof
the stego-image. Thus, the quality of visual impercep-
tibility is maintained. These results suggest that the
hiding capacity of our method is great, while good
visual imperceptibility is maintained.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a novel radar image
steganographic method based on modulus function-
based steganography and BEMD. The hiding capacity
of our method is improved, by about 2.4 bits of secret
information in one pixel of the cover radar image. For-
tunately, good visual imperceptibility is maintained;
the PSNR is higher than 42 db. Therefore people
cannot find the existing of the secret information.
In this method, the reader can determine five param-
eters. As a result, statistical analyses against our
method must estimate five parameters. As we know,
only one parameter can be hard to estimate. The esti-
mation of five parameters becomes very difficult. In
addition, the pixel into which the modulus value of a
block is embedded is chosen by the secret key. Thus,
steganographic analysts can not obtain parameters or
secret key. That is to say, anyone who does not know
the parameters and the secret key can hardly extract or
detect the secret information.

ABSTRACT:
SWOT is a technique for making a strategic plan based on the analysis of internal and external
factors.TheclassicSWOTanalysistechniqueneedsveryhighpersonneldiathesisanditsresultsarecomparatively
random. Therefore, the internal and external factors with weak correlation can be taken as the break point.
Through rationally dividing the associated factors, substituting low level factors for high level factors, and
increasing the correlation of internal and external factors, a TS-SWOT analysis model is established based on
the trace substitution principle. Through research on the strategy generation principle, grammar, and steps, the
classic SWOT analysis is improved, and a strategic planning method is proposed based on TS-SWOT. This
method provides a basis for generating more scientific strategic planning.

INTRODUCTION
The rapid development of society and science depends
on advanced and feasible strategic planning.The inter-
nal and external environmental analysis is requested in
strategic planning (Research Department of National
Defense University, 2009). SWOT analysis is an anal-
ysis of Strengths (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities
(O) and Threats (T) of the system, thus generating
a system development strategy and providing guid-
ance for system development. When making a SWOT
analysis, it should firstly be known exactly what the
strengths,weaknesses,opportunities,andthreatsofthe
research object are. Then, through comprehensively
evaluating and analysing the strengths and weak-
nesses of internal factors and opportunities and threats
of external factors, strategic planning can be made
according to the studied conclusions (Gao, 2010). The
system strategy generating from SWOT analysis is
concluded in the following steps:
(1) Comprehensively analysing the internal condi-
tions, history, current situation, and future trends
of the external environment of the research object
by means of investigation, literature analysis, etc.
The internal conditions include the organizational
management, personnel technology, etc., and the
external environment mainly includes the national
policy, the social environment, etc.
(2) According to the influence degree of the research
object, ordering all factors through the survey
analysis, and constructing a SWOT matrix.
(3) By using the method of system analysis, match-
ing each two of the four kinds of influence factors
of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and
threats together. Then, based on principles of
exerting strengths, overcoming weaknesses, seiz-
ing opportunities, and avoiding threats, a series
of alternative development strategies are gener-
ated, such as Strength-Opportunity strategy (SO),
Weakness-Opportunity strategy (WO), Strength-
Threat strategy (ST), and Weakness-Threat strat-
egy (WT).
A primary advantage of the SWOT analysis is its
comprehensiveness and systematic way of studying
problems. The comprehensiveness means that it con-
siders all influencing factors of the research object,
including internal conditions, external environments,
and the correlation of these two kinds of factors. Based
on this, we can make the alternatives of strategic
planning to choose. The systematicness means that
it undertakes research according to a logical proce-
dure of analysing the present situation, finding out
the problems, and dealing with the problems. How-
ever, the classic SWOT analysis still has the following
problems:
(1) The classic SWOT analysis requires higher per-
sonnel quality.
(2) Conclusions gained from the classic SWOT anal-
ysis are often different from person to person.
(3) The classic SWOT analysis fails to consider the
order of the strategic priority.
125

One important reason for these problems is that dif-
ferent researchers analyse and match the internal and
external factors differently; especially, when the corre-
lation of internal and external factors is not strong, this
is always ignored by some researchers. Even though
some researchers have considered the correlation, it
still leads to inaccurate research conclusions due to
their different understanding of the two factors.
In order to solve the problems above, the internal
and external factors with weak correlation are taken as
the break point. Through rationally dividing the asso-
ciated factors, substituting low level elements for high
level elements, and increasing the correlation of inter-
nal and external factors, aTS-SWOT analysis model is
established, based on the trace substitution principle.
Based on the strategy generation principle, grammar,
and steps, the classic SWOT analysis is improved, and
a strategic planning method is proposed, based on TS-
SWOT, which provides a basis for generating more
scientific strategic planning. By using more rigorous
ideas and quantitative analysis methods, the arbitrari-
ness of the proposed strategy can be avoided to some
extent, and the strategy can be described quantitatively,
based on the correlation degree and influence degree,
which improves the scientific feature of the SWOT
analysis.
2
TS-SWOT MODEL
2.1
Description of TS-SWOT model
Definition: a TS-SWOT model can be obtained by
analysing internal factors, external factors, and their
associations, which contains 6 elements:
where,
Tr is a TS-SWOT object;
E = O ∪T is the set of external factors;
O = {Oi, i = 1, 2, . . . , IO} is the opportunity set, that
is,thefactorswhichbelongtoexternalopportunitiesof
the object system, and IO is the number of opportunity
factors.
T = {Ti, i = 1, 2, . . . , IT} is the threat set, that is, the
factors which belong to external threats of the object
system, and IT is the number of threat factors;
N = S ∪W is the set of internal factors;
S = {Sj, j = 1, 2, . . . , JS} is the strength set, that is,
the factors which belong to strength conditions of the
object system, and JS is the number of strength factors.
W = {Wj, j = 1, 2, . . . , JW } is the weakness set, that
is, the factors which belong to weakness conditions of
the object system, and JW is the number of weakness
factors.
R = {E × N} is a relation pair composed of
external environmental factors and internal con-
dition factors, where Ei × Nj is just the correla-
tion between the external factor Ei and the inter-
nal condition Nj. According to the definition of
E and N, we know that R = {ROS, ROW , RTS, RTW },
where ROS = {O × S}IO × JS , ROW = {O ×W}IO × JW ,
RTS = {T × S}IT × JS, and RTW = {T ×W}IT × JW ;
r = {rij} is the correlation set.
rij = r(Ei × Nj) is the correlation of the external fac-
tor Ei and the internal condition Nj, where 0 ≤rij < 1.
If there is no relation between Ei and Nj, then r = 0;
otherwise, the supposed Ei can be equivalently substi-
tuted by ki, sub elements of the same level, Nj, can be
substituted by kj sub elements of the same level, and if
the number of these two kinds of elements with strong
correlation is b, then:
d = {dij} is the layer distance set of factors;
dij = d(Ei × Nj) is the layer distance extent of the
external factor Ei and the internal condition Nj. If Ei
and Nj are all the first level influence factors, then
dij = 2; if the external factor is the next level of the m
level influence factors, and the internal factor is the
next level of the n level influence factors, then:
a =

aij

is the set of the strategy importance;
aij = a

Ei × Nj

is the importance of strategy com-
prised of the external factor Ei and the internal con-
dition Nj, which is a measure of strategy availability
or its influence on the system development, where
0 ≤aij ≤1. If the strategy is not feasible or necessary,
that is to say, this strategy is not attractive, then aij = 0.
2.2
The principle of TS-SWOT analysis
Theorem: If r(Ei × Nj) ̸= 0 and r(Ei × Nj) is smaller,
then ∃(Eik ∈Ei, Njl ∈Nj); it will make r(Eik × Njl) >
r(Ei × Nj), and r(Eik × Njl) is bigger.
Proof: Suppose Ei = {Ei1, Ei2, . . . , EiK}, Nj = {Nj1,
Nj2, . . . , NjL}, and if r(Ei × Nj) ̸= 0, it means that Ei is
associatedwith Nj.Assumingthenumberofthefactors
with strong correlation is b, according to Formula (2),
we know that:
If r(Ei × Nj) is smaller, it means that Ei and
Nj
are not closely related, then ∃(Eim ∈Ei), it
makes r(Eim × Nj) = 0 or ∃(Njl ∈Nj), and it makes
r(Ei × Njl) = 0. To the first situation, suppose E′
i is a
set without this factor, then:
To the second situation, suppose N ′
j is also a set
without this factor, then:
126

Through continuous subtraction, we can find a rela-
tively small number of substitution sets or substitution
set combinations, which makes the association among
the sets remains unchanged after subtraction, and the
value of r(Eik × Njl) can become bigger to a larger
extent.
Conclusion: In the TS-SWOT analysis, through
rationally dividing the internal and external factors,
and substituting low level elements for high level
elements, the correlation degree can be effectively
increased. This conclusion is called the trace substi-
tution principle.
With regard to the division of factors, there are
mainly three situations, as follows:
(1) division of the internal condition factors;
(2) division of the external environmental factors;
(3) division of the internal conditions and external
environmental factors at the same time.
In the process of generating a strategy, the classifi-
cation method needs to be chosen according to actual
situations.
Thus, in the case of weak correlation, the descrip-
tion and application of internal and external factors is
the primary cause of the randomness of strategic anal-
ysis. According to the above theorem and conclusion,
as long as the factors with weak correlation can be
divided rationally and the superior set can be substi-
tuted by the next subset, the correlation of factors can
be increased and the situational analysis results will be
relatively definite.
The above process of dividing influence factors
with weak correlation into the next level is called the
trace process, and the process of substituting the next
level sub factors for the original is called the substi-
tution process. The SWOT situation analysis which
introduces these two processes is called TS-SWOT
analysis.
3
STRATEGY GENERATION PROCESS BASED
ON TS-SWOT ANALYSIS
3.1
Analysis of dividing TS-SWOT level
Based on trace substitution, TS-SWOT analysis can
resolve the problem of strategy generation under
the circumstances of little association between inter-
nal conditions and the external environment, which
can be achieved through further division of internal
conditions and the external environment.
As is seen above, internal conditions or external
environmental factors can be decomposed through
level division. It is a good way to remove irrelevant
factors and increase the correlation degree by substi-
tuting the next level factor for the superior. However,
while factors are traced and substituted, it also leads
to a narrow scope and low importance of the strat-
egy generated. For example, as for the problem of
the army equipment support transformation strategy,
“high-tech” is an external environmental factor and
“information construction” is an internal factor. When
analysing the correlation of these two kinds of factors,
we need to trace and substitute the “high-tech” for
“information technology” to increase the correlation,
thus “information technology” and “information con-
struction” will have a strong relationship. However,
as “high-tech” factor is more important, its weight
will be reduced if replaced with “information tech-
nology.” If it is 0.2 times more than the original, the
importance degree of the strategy generated by “infor-
mation technology” and “information construction”
should be 0.2 times the product of “high-tech” weight
and “information construction” weight. If it is further
decomposed, the strategy importance degree will be
0.04 times the original. The importance of the strat-
egy declining indicates that the strategy effectiveness
reduces. Therefore, to make sure the usefulness of the
strategy, factor division levels should be fewer.
3.2
Strategy generation grammar of TS-SWOT
By using the method of system analysis, each two of
the four kinds of influence factors of the strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, together can
be matched, thus forming a series of optional devel-
opment strategies of Strength – Opportunity strategy,
Weakness-Opportunity strategy, Strength-Threat strat-
egy, andWeakness-Threat strategy, etc.This paper will
propose a method of strategy generation based on the
combined syntax, which is shown in Formula (7):
where, Rij: strategy generated by Ei and Nj;
VE: external environmental factor verbs;
Ei: external environmental factors;
VN: internal condition factor verbs;
Nj: internal condition factors;
VV : direction of strategic application.
VE, VN and VV are defined as follows:
The strategy can be generated according to the
grammar above.

Steps of TS-SWOT analysis
In actual correlation analysis, we can divide the cor-
relation according to {0, less, 1}, thus distinguish-
ing whether the external factors are related with the
internal conditions, and whether trace substitution is
127

required. On this basis, the process ofTS-SWOT anal-
ysis is established. The concrete operation steps are as
follows:
Step (1): analysing internal condition factors;
Ways: it is carried out by studying the inter-
nal conditions of the system. Internal condition
factors are positive or negative factors existing
in the process of the system development and
evolution, which need to analyse the resources,
organization, system, and mechanism, etc. When
analysing, the status of the object system, as well
as its future trends, should be considered; defin-
ing the positive factor of the internal conditions
as strength, and denoting S = {Sj, j = 1, 2, . . . , JS};
defining the negative factor as weakness and denot-
ingW = {Wj, j = 1, 2, . . . , JW }; thereby the condition
factor set is N = S ∪W.
Step (2): analysing external environmental factors;
Ways: by means of investigation and analysis of the
external environment, we can obtain all external envi-
ronmental factors of the object system; considering
factors of economy, politics, society, science, tech-
nology, and competition, etc., and dividing them into
two kinds of factors of advantages and disadvantages;
defining the advantages as opportunities and denoting
O = {Oi, i = 1, 2, . . . , IO}; defining the disadvantages
as threats and denoting T = {Ti, i = 1, 2, . . . , IT};
thereby the external environmental factor set is
E = O ∪T.
Step (3): ordering internal condition factors;
Ways: ordering the internal condition factors
obtained from Step (1) according to its influence
on the development and evolution of the system or
the priority improvement degree (all are called the
‘influence degree’). We can gain the internal con-
dition factors after ordering, which are denoted as:
N = {Nj|Nj ∈S ∩W,A(Nk) > A(Ni) while k < l, where
j, k, l = 1, 2, . . . , JS = JW }, where A(Nj) is the influ-
ence degree of internal condition factor Nj on the
object system, which can be obtained by analysing the
dependence degree of the system development goals
on internal factors with the Quality Function Deploy
(QFD) method.
Step (4): ordering external environmental factors;
Ways: ordering the external environmental fac-
tors
obtained
from
Step
(2)
according
to
its
influence on the development and evolution of
the system. We can gain the external environ-
mental factors after ordering, which are denoted
as: E = {Ei|Ei ∈O ∩T,
B(Ek) > B(El), while k < l,
where i, k, l = 1, 2, . . . , IO + IT}}, where B(Ei) is the
influence degree of external environmental factor Ei
on the object system. Similarly, Ei can also be obtained
in the same way as Step (3).
Step (5): give an initial value j = 0, i = 0; define the
strategy set R = , k = 0;
Step (6): let j = j + 1; if j ≤JS + JW , then go to
Step (7), otherwise go to Step (19);
Step (7): let i = i + 1, if i < IO + IT, then go to
Step (8), otherwise, go to Step (6);

Step (15): let l = 0, m = 0.
Step (16): process of the trace substitution. Decom-
pose the external environmental factor Ei according
to its maximum influence discrepancy on the internal
condition factor Nj. Find out the primary influence
factor, and define it as Eil, l = 1, 2, . . . , Li. Mean-
while, we can determine its corresponding B(Eil),
where: Li
l = 1 B(Eil) ≤B(Ei). Analyse the correlation
r(Eil × Nj), if more than one of r(Eil × Nj) is big-
ger, let d(Eil × Nj) = 3; go to Step (17); if r(Eil × Nj)
are all smaller, then decompose the internal condition
factor Nj according to its maximum influence discrep-
ancy of Eil, define it as Njm, m = 1, 2, . . . , Mj, and
determine A(Njm), where Mj
m = 1 A(Njm) ≤A(Nj).Then
analyse each correlation r(Eil × Njm), and find out the
bigger factor pair. Then let the factor layer distance
d(Eil × Njm) = 4; go to Step (18).
Step (17): generating the strategy set accord-
ing to Step (10)–Step (13), and after every strat-
egy generation, let ak = a(Eil × Nj) = A(Nj)B(Eil) and
dk = d(Eil × Nj) = 3; k = k + 1; go to Step (7);
Step (18): generating the strategy set according
to Step (10) ∼Step (13), and after every strategy
generation, letak = a(Eil × Njm) = A(Njm)B(Eil) and
dk = d(Eil × Njm) = 4; k = k + 1; go to Step (7);
Step (19): let k = k −1, we can obtain the strategy
set R and the responding importance set a;
Step (20): classify the strategies according to SO,
ST, WO, and WT, and summarize the importance
of every kind of strategy. Then, use ordering and
analysing to get the current situations.
For the strategy set generated from the above steps,
we can abstract and conclude further to obtain feasible
strategy planning.

STRATEGY GENERATION INSTANCES OF
THE ARMY EQUIPMENT SUPPORT
TRANSFORMATION
4.1
Backgrounds
The army equipment support transformation is a com-
plicated system of engineering. It has characteristics of
wide ranges, many uncertain factors, enormous cost,
long duration time, and strong correlation (Liu, 2011,
Cao, 2012).A strategy for the army equipment support
transformation can provide guidelines for equipment
support transformation. Due to its many influencing
factors, it is very difficult to generating strategies.
Below, we will use the method proposed in this paper
to generate a transformation strategy.
4.2
Analysis of internal conditions and the external
environment
We need to analyse the internal conditions and the
external environment of the equipment support system
effectively (Zhang, 2011), including fully grasping the
opportunities brought by the external environment for
the transformation work, clearly defining the threats
which the transformation work may be faced with,
understanding the current situations of the equipment
support system, and determining the strengths and
weaknesses of an army equipment support system; all
of these will lay the foundation for making a scien-
tific transformation strategy. Through expert scoring,
the factor weights can be determined by the method of
Analytic Network Process (ANP) and rough set theory.
The external environmental factors and their weight
are shown in Formula 1, the internal condition factors
and their weight are shown in Table 2.
4.3
Analysis of correlation of the army equipment
support transformation factors
Through correlation analysis of the internal condition
factors and the external environmental factors above,
the results are gained and shown in Table 3.

Values in table 3 indicate the correlation r(Eik × Njl)
of the internal conditions and the external environmen-
tal factors.
r(Eik × Njl) = 1 indicates that there is strong cor-
relation between its internal conditions and external
environmental factors.
r(Eik × Njl) = 0 indicates that there is no corre-
lation between its internal conditions and external
environmental factors.
0 < r(Eik × Njl) < 1 indicates that more than one
of the internal conditions and external environmen-
tal factors needs trace substitution to determine their
correlations.
4.4
Analysis of trace substitution factors
After analysing the factors with little correlation
in Table 4, the trace substitution goes along with
substituting sub factors for original factors to increase
the correlation degree of factors. The results of trace
substitution are shown inTable 4, the factors which are
traced and substituted are shown in brackets.
By substituting the traced and substituted factors
for the original factors, we can further get the strategy
planning.
4.5
Analysis of effect
From the process above, we can see that as a result
of trace substitution, the correlation of the fac-
tors is obviously increased; therefore, the strategy
finally generated will be more concrete, scientific, and
feasible.
5
CONCLUSIONS
The scientific feature of the strategic planning is a
basic requirement for strategy generation. In origi-
nal SWOT methods of generating strategies, different
researchers often have had different understanding of
the correlation, as led to the difference in strategies
generation. However, through the trace substitution of
factors, researchers can consider a problem from the
nature of the correlation, and thus be able to under-
stand the system in an analytic perspective, as can
still improve the factors correlation and minimize the
randomness of the strategic planning. And it is abso-
lutely essential for scientifically understanding the
system development trend and effectively planning the
strategy.

A case-driven 4S teaching model
Ming Huang & Shu Yu Hu
Hunan Radio and TV University, Changsha, China
ABSTRACT:
As educational reform goes further and deeper, a growing number of schools have recognized
certain teaching ideas, such as “combination of working and learning”, “task-driven”, “experimental training”,
and “project teaching based on working process”, which are put into active practice. In response to the curricular
reform and the idea of Personal Finance, it is especially important to rebuild the knowledge system, adjust
and reinforce the teaching contents, and explore the proper teaching model accordingly. In the principle of
“satisfying the demand, exhibiting the teaching characteristics, focusing on quality development, and simplifying
the teaching content”, it is required to incorporate new teaching concept and practice into the course, and precisely
reflect the newest policy, law and regulations, industrial standards, technological methods, and development
findings in the financial industry. By doing so, the “case-driven 4S teaching model” with “updated concept,
system, content, and method” may be discovered, which could be well-suited to the development of application-
oriented talent.

INTRODUCTION
China’s economy is on the track to continuous devel-
opment, which is the impetus for the development of
familyfinance.Undersuchacontext,PersonalFinance
has been set up. With a large group of students, it is
worthwhile to probe into how to cater to their finan-
cial demand, and strengthen their financial concept
and ability by improving the course teaching. To that
regard, we should think from the angle of students, and
conduct the teaching of personal finance through dis-
cussing the case-driven 4S teaching model, according
to the practical characteristics of personal finance. It is
intended to promote the improvement of teaching and
the transformation of learning, and enhance class effi-
ciency and student quality, thereby attaining the goal
of the personal finance course.

THE GUIDELINE OF TEACHING MODEL
REFORM IN PERSONAL FINANCE
According to constructionism, knowledge can only
be acquired with the help of others (including teach-
ers and learning companions), and by tapping into
the necessary learning materials through the sense-
making model, rather than the transfer of knowledge
from teachers. Constructionism calls for a learner-
centred study under the instruction of teachers, or
in other words, it not only emphasizes the learner’s
role as a cognitive subject, but also stresses the pre-
dominant role of teachers. The learning environment
of constructionism consists of four elements, which
are situation construction, collaboration construction,
dialogue construction, and meaning construction.
As personal finance is one subject with good appli-
cability, its reform of the teaching model should
highlight the practical demand, and emphasize the
student’s practical and operational capability. Under
the conditions of modern information and technology,
the case-driven personal finance 4S teaching model
is guided by humanism and constructionism, which
adheres to the human-based and learning-centred prin-
ciple, and emphasizes the stimulation of the student’s
internal demand for learning, thereby encouraging
proactive learning; it also concentrates on the social
and situational nature of knowledge, which enables
students to learn the way of study, collaboration,
dialogue, and application. In this sense, this teach-
ing model conforms to the demand of time and the
requirement of social development.
3
THE CONTENT AND FRAMEWORK OF THE
CASE-DRIVEN 4S TEACHING MODEL
The case-driven 4S teaching model combines teach-
ing with practice, makes the teaching task typical, and
131

Figure 1.
The basic framework of the case-driven 4S teach-
ing model.
simulates the case for the student to consider, analyse,
and judge; it develops the student’s capability for self-
study, cognition, and finance through the 4S method,
the elements of which are “Study, Salon, Survey, and
Scheme”, thereby building a case that drives teach-
ing organization throughout the teaching processes,
according to the teaching objective and requirement of
personal finance. The basic framework can be shown
in Figure 1 below:
From the above, this case-driven 4S teaching model
is made up of four parts or steps, Study—Salon—
Survey—Scheme, and these four case-driven parts
collectively create an open and constructionist learn-
ing environment for students. In such an environment,
the teacher can organize and guide the teaching pro-
cesses, and help or encourage students to complete the
meaningful construction. In contrast, students are the
active participators of study, the active constructors of
knowledge, collaborative interlocutors of study, shar-
ers of information collections, and self-test monitors
of process throughout the teaching processes.
4
THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
CASE-DRIVEN 4S TEACHING MODEL
The case-driven 4S teaching model for Personal
Finance is oriented at financial demand and driven by
feature case, while its creativity, smoothness, and dis-
tinctive features can be exhibited through the teaching
organization - “Study—Salon—Survey—Scheme.”
1. Core: “Study” is the core part. In the four parts
under this model, the role of the teacher is only lim-
ited to “guiding”, but students are the practitioners
of activities, thus greatly highlighting the student’s
subjectivity and self-study. For instance, “Finan-
cial Study” requires the students to actively study
and construct the knowledge; “Financial Salon”
demands the students to collaborate in dialogue,
and actively involve themselves in the group study;
“Financial Survey” requires the students to col-
lect the financial information by themselves; while
“Financial Scheme” demands the students to carry
out the meaning construction by performing the
acquired theories and skills. These parts can not
only drive the students to reinforce the learning pro-
cess, but also stimulate the students to fully use and
absorb the effective study.
2. Objectives: It is intended to develop the student’s
learning capability and financial capability. Each
part emphasizes the need to develop the student’s
learning capability. “Introduce the case and learn
the finance”, for instance, guides the students to
find out the problems by illustrating the cases that
are close to reality; “Verify through the case and
survey the finance” can lead the students to realize
the problems; “Financial Scheme” and “Financial
Salon” can encourage the students to examine and
solve the problems. In the meanwhile, the four
parts are always targeted at developing the financial
capability gradually, which requires the students
to grasp the key points of finance, exchange their
financial experience, keep up with their financial
status, and work out the financial scheme, etc.
3. Symbols: The feasibility of this teaching model is
marked by three symbols: first, the guiding role
of the teacher is fully displayed; second, teach-
ing organization and designing could effectively
improve the student’s learning; third, the student’s
teaching objective and requirement can be greatly
met. The models such as “case-driven”, “expert
financial salon” and “financial scheme” not only
exercises the guiding role of the teacher but also
greatly promotes the student’s self-study. The other
four parts are linked one another, guiding the stu-
dents to master the knowledge and expertise of
personal finance in an logical, purposeful, and
strategic manner.
4. Strategies: Guiding students to aid their study,
encouraging students to facilitate their study, lead-
ing students to practice their study, and evaluating
the students according to their practices. “Guid-
ing students to aid the study” is the basic strategy
that we are always adopting; “encouraging students
to facilitate the study” is the fundamental strategy
throughout the case-driven teaching model; “lead-
ing students to practice the study” requires the
students to be aware of the learning objective of
Personal Finance, which can be described as learn-
ing the financial scheme, encouraging the action by
study, and practicing the study by action; “evaluat-
ing the student according to their practices” teaches
the students to have a down-to-earth learning atti-
tude towards personal finance, while students must
put the acquired knowledge into use, and promote
the study according to their financial demands.
5. Focuses: 1. The student’s position. This model fol-
lows closely the characteristics of HNRTU(Hunan
Radio and TV University) students as “general
professionals”, which focuses especially on the
family and personal financial demand, combines
their professional capability with the instruction,
and encourages the students to accumulate more
132

experience of practices in daily work and life; 2.
The action orientation. This model has the action-
oriented “how to self-manage finance”, which
emphasizes the student’s role as the learning sub-
ject,therebycreatinganatmospherewhereteaching
interacts with learning and the teacher interacts
with the student. Through their specific financial
situations, students are guided to acquire knowl-
edge and expertise, and complete the task by
themselves, thus enhancing their execution capa-
bility; 3. The case-based drive. Whenever the
teacher introduces a financial instrument, he or
she can drive the student’s craving for knowl-
edge by involving a great many of financial
stories and scheme cases, which can promote
their ability to apply the acquired professional
knowledge and expertise; 4. Interactive teaching.
The financial salon calls for on-site interaction
between the expert and students or amongst stu-
dents, which can optimize the learning effects; 5.
The extra-curricular benefit. The learning model
“Study + Salon + Survey + Scheme”canachievea
win-win result in both professional capabilities and
personal qualities.

THE SCHEME OF IMPLEMENTING THE
CASE-DRIVEN 4S TEACHING MODEL
The case-driven 4S teaching model is to be imple-
mented by introducing, exchanging, examining, and
answering the case, which can be basically described
as follows:
5.1
Step 1: Case introduction, financial study
For most families in amateur financing, the basic
objective of learning about personal finance is to
establish the rational concept of finance, grasp basic
knowledge of finance, and demonstrate basic exper-
tise of finance. To help students basically understand
the importance of personal finance and manage the
key points of personal finance, this step is mainly
conducted by teachers to guide the study, while stu-
dents are proactively learning and thinking under the
teacher’s guidance, instead of cramming knowledge.
They practice themselves in classroom communica-
tion and discussion of knowledge, ranging from active
thinking, actively finding out and raising problems,
and actively solving problems, to the active recogni-
tion. In each theme, teachers introduce some represen-
tative cases, explain the importance of finance, specify
the key points of finance, or provide some clues of
finance, which allows students to realize and think
twice about their financial situation, and stimulates
their learning. This is more obvious in our teaching
materials. “Personal Insurance Finance”, for instance,
we have illustrated four examples, “Build the insur-
ance pyramid before conducting the family finance”,
“Lausanne was hit into a car accident and Lausanne’s
parent had no alternative but went back to Tibetan”,
“Deep reflection ofYujuan Event” and “Consideration
after the disaster”, which gives incentive to the stu-
dent’s demand for the knowledge and expertise about
personal insurance finance.
5.2
Step 2: Case exchange, financial salon
In this step, an exchange platform of collaboration and
communication can be built up, which creates a learn-
ing atmosphere focusing on wealth, enjoying finance,
and highlighting the importance of personal finance.
In the two forms, “Student Finance Salon” and “Expert
Finance Salon”, it can change the student’s financial
concept, and improve the student’s financial quality.
In order to enhance the effect of the finance salon,
the teacher generally assigns a task before the salon.
For example, students are required to present the case
study or raise the confusion and problem concerning
personal finance, allowing them to be immersed into
the salon atmosphere, and absorb the knowledge.
“Student Finance Salon” refers to a group that is
spontaneously organized by several students, where
they can exchange and help each other. Students can
exchange their own financial experience and learning
experience of the personal finance course; they can
exchange ideas about personal finance knowledge and
surveys; teacher can assess and exchange the finance
scheme as prepared by students; they can plan and
evaluate the finance based on real situations; they can
organize and participate in finance simulation compe-
titions,allowingthemtoputknowledgeintouse,etc.In
thisform,studentscangainmoreknowledge,andprac-
tice the coordination and communication skills with
each other, thereby promoting the exchange.
“Expert Finance Salon” refers to the profes-
sional lecture given by financial experts that features
interaction, communication, and personalized design.
Through this lecture, that combines knowledge with
practice, students can understand the newest infor-
mation about the financial market, and learn special-
ized financial knowledge; they can get much closer
to all kinds of bank financial products; enjoy the
professional financial instruction; and optimize their
personal assets.
5.3
Step 3: Case examining, financial survey
As personal finance develops with time and practice,
students are required to do more practical surveys and
collect financial information. This is done by orga-
nizing the students to visit the practice base, or for
groups of students to conduct surveys on the websites
of financial institutions or branches. As a result, they
will understand the situation of bank finance, know the
channels of financing, know the types and character-
istics of financial products, experience the operational
flow of financial business, appreciate the financial cul-
ture, and strengthen their knowledge about the real
financial market, thus justifying us to work out the
financial scheme accordingly. As described in “Per-
sonal Insurance Finance”, the teacher assigns a survey:
133

go to several companies offering life insurance, under-
stand the situation of financial insurance, and design
an appropriate scheme for financial insurance accord-
ing to the family’s condition. We can understand the
operational effectiveness of the financial instrument
and grasp the financial situation of the financial insti-
tution only through surveying, which also provides a
reference and basis for us to work out the appropriate
financial scheme.

Step 4: Case answering, financial scheme
The ultimate objective of personal finance is to
understand the financial trend, understand financial
demands, and tailor the financial plan depending on
personal condition, in order to maximize the personal
wealth and achieve the financial freedom, whether for
common residents or financial professionals. By fol-
lowing the said three phases, learners can more or less
understand the common methods and skills concern-
ing personal finance, but how to design a financial
scheme according to a given case, or how to plan
for the future based on the available resources, is seen
as the problem to be solved. In this phase, students
play the role of finishing it, while teacher is respon-
sible for guiding students to plan and finance through
presenting the case study based on the given condition.
“Personal Financial Overview”, for instance, requires
the students to make a financial analysis of Mr. Song’s
family’s financial standing and design the comprehen-
sive scheme of the family’s financial plan based on
the specified case, or “Personal Insurance Finance”
requires the students to conduct insurance finance
depending on the individualized insurance demand.

THE EFFECTS OF APPLYING THE
CASE-DRIVEN 4S TEACHING MODEL
This model introduces a learning situation via an actual
case, and conducts a practical survey that is, more or
less, the same with the reality, and answer or probe
into the case through financial planning and financial
salon, thus improving the financial quality of learners.
By doing so, it is much applicable because of the incor-
poration of theoretical teaching with practical teaching
and teaching with social service.
First and foremost, it obtains the intended teach-
ing objective of the course. The teaching objective of
a personal financial course is to popularize the basic
knowledge of personal finance and develop the basic
skills of personal finance; as a result, the student’s
learning interest can be motivated. It also reinforces
the theoretical and systematic knowledge base, devel-
ops analytical and problem-solving abilities, thereby
allowing students to put their acquired knowledge to
good use. The case-driven 4S teaching model com-
bines network, market, and classroom, in other words,
it incorporates the sky network, the ground network
and the human network(Remote network education
terminology). In this way, it helps students embrace

the society or job gives more chances for students to
practice, allows them to partake in brainstorming for
analysing real problems, allows them to find out the
appropriatemethodtosolverealproblems,andensures
they acquire a well-founded knowledge of financial
skills. Meanwhile, the case-driven 4S teaching model
combines theory with practice, guides the students to
learn, discuss, survey, and plan while being involved
in the case study, thereby attaining the course objec-
tive.According to the distribution of final exam marks
for Personal Finance in two recent years (as shown in
Figure 2), the number of students selecting Personal
Finance is ever increasing. The percentage below 60
scores is ever decreasing, while the percentage above
90 scores is ever increasing. In January, 2014, the per-
centage above 90 scores reached 43.3%, accounting
for approximately half of the students.
Secondly, it effectively improves the student’s capa-
bility of lifelong study. Lifelong study capability is
one of the necessary skills for survival in our current
society, which mainly includes self-study capability
and information quality capability. According to the
statistics, as shown in Figure 3, financial majors or
non-financial majors spent more hours in online learn-
ing for the past one and half a year. In this sense, the
personalfinance4Steachingmodelcanencouragestu-
dents to conduct self-study and lifelong study aided
by information technology. It is gradually becoming a
habit.
By presenting the financial cases close to the life
experience, the case-driven 4S teaching model guides
the students to learn by themselves, drives them to
learn and discuss further under the teaching organi-
zation consisting of teacher-student interaction, and
organically combines learning objectives, working
requirements, and survival skills, thus creating an
open learning environment for students. The cases in
the environment are collected by students themselves;
some are familiar ones, while some are very close to
the financial stories and examples in day-to-day life.
Bylearningthesecasestudies,studentscanunderstand
and satisfy their own financial demands.These factors
could inspire a craving for knowledge and learning,
driving students to look into the case.

Finance network knowledge in November, 2013.
Last but not the least, the model develops the
student’s knowledge about society. Personal Finance
is defined by many schools as a general curricu-
lum, so it means that personal finance capabil-
ity has become a kind of general capability that
everyone should demonstrate. The learning model
“Study+Salon+Survey+Scheme” can be performed to
train the student’s basic financial capability and social
communication capability, and this combination of
training would be the key to developing the student’s
general social capability. In the second half of the
2013 semester, HRTU organized the Personal Finance
Network Knowledge Competition and Case Design
Match, which attracted 3,023 competitors in total. As
shown in Figure 4, there were 534 competitors above
99 scores, accounting for 17.7%.According to the stu-
dents, Personal Finance adopts the “case-driven 4S”
teaching model, which provides the channels for stu-
dents, such as financial surveys and expert salons. It
encourages the students to focus on and grasp their
financial environment, which develops their recogni-
tion and sensibility about the financial market; more-
over, students can participate in the social financial
consulting activities, thereby actualizing the financial
interaction and communication between campus and
workplace.

ABSTRACT:
During the cultivation of electronic engineering talents for modern enterprises, practical teaching
is an indispensable and important part. This paper analyses the question about the VHDL course in the college
teaching system. The teaching hours, the new experimental items, and the ways of evaluation and examination
of this course are redesigned in the CDIO framework. At the same time, this paper shows how to redefine the
roles of the teachers. Several years of teaching practice show that it is efficient to inspire students’ enthusiasm
for learning and to improve their creative ability and engineering consciousness.

INTRODUCTION
With the development of microelectronics technology
and design techniques, it becomes more and more
complex to design electronic circuits. Using VHDL
(Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Description Lan-
guage) can increase the development efficiency and
shorten the development time. Now VHDL is widely
used in industrial automation and control, intelli-
gent instrumentation, digital signal processing, and
communications fields with the IEEE’s (Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers) help. It also plays
an important role in modern industrial areas.
VHDL is a basic course for students of electronic
information engineering, electronic science and tech-
nology, and integrated circuit design and integration
of systems. Students can improve their practice, inno-
vation, and teamwork abilities, and lay the foundation
for the future of electronic design by learning from this
course. This paper is a study on the teaching reform
of the VHDL course under the guidance of CDIO,
including its teaching content, the teacher’s role, local-
ization, and experiment teaching etc. This paper also
presents a new training method to build the electronic
engineering technology professionals’ literacy.

CONCEPT OF CDIO
CDIO is the newest achievement of international engi-
neering education reform in recent years, which is
based on the framework of modern engineering educa-
tion at MIT(Massachusetts Institute Of Technology),
and advocated by dozens of the world’s leading
universities. CDIO is an initialism for Conceive-
Design-Implement-Operate. It is a new educational
framework. The students should learn actively by fin-
ishing several projects in the course. All the projects
should not only limited in this course but also contain
some related courses. All of these require the students
connecting what they have learned to what they are
learning actively in the projects. Specifically, it sets a
specific project where the students learn the knowl-
edge of the main areas of expertise in the completion
of the project, during the process. So this model is also
known as a project-based learning model.

PROBLEMS IN THE EXPERIMENT
TEACHING PROCESS
A VHDL course, which has less hours but involving a
wide range of knowledge, require the students have
practical operations capability. Our teaching team,
over years of theoretical and experimental teaching of
VHDL, have found some problems:
(1) The course structure was unreasonable and the
experimental projects were too simple.The course
carried three credits. It would take 48 hours: 40
hours for lectures, and 8 hours for experiments.
The course paid more attention to engineering sci-
ence knowledge, whilst ignoring practical training
and comprehensive ability.
(2) Therolesoftheteachersandstudentswereunclear.
The teachers centred on lecturing in class and
lacked communication with students. This will
make them lack of innovation. At the same time,
the students experimented in a purely mechanical
137

manner and studied passively according to the
experimental textbook. They could not correlate
their learned knowledge and lacked ability to think
independently.
(3) The students lacked creative consciousness and
active knowledge expansion, so it was hard for
them to build their own intellectual constructs.
The students did not grasp the development trend
of modern electronic technology which led to less
interest and ignoring the cultivation of interest.
(4) Some students did not understand the use of this
course. They choose this course only to get cred-
its instead of mastering and using it. So the knowl-
edge they had learned passively, was difficult to
use in practical projects.

EXPERIMENTAL TEACHING REFORM
BASED ON CDIO
In order to solve the existing problems in the experi-
ment teaching process, our teaching team has carried
on a further exploration. We have get the experience
of the reformation of experimental teaching in the
comprehensive practice.
4.1
Arranging hours and content of the theory
teaching based on CDIO
VHDL never stands still. It is always changing and
developing. It can be used at each stage of the digital
system design. Therefore, it is important to arrange
the teaching contents and hours logically. Practice has
proved that this course should consist of 3 credits,
including32hoursforthetheoryteachingand16hours
for the practice. Theory teaching focuses on a soft-
waredevelopmentenvironmentwhenusingQuartusII,
application design flow and method of depiction, basic
structures, and basic function of sentences when using
VHDL. So, this paper suggests arranging the theory
teaching contents and hours according to Table 1.
According to the CDIO teaching idea, students
are the principal part of learning. Teachers should
build a good learning environment, develop learning
resources, and serve students learning. So the teach-
ers should prepare some design examples in which
a knowledge point can be set by using multimedia
courseware. An experiment is presented to enhance
students’ perceptual knowledge when needed. In this
framework the students actively learn instead of pas-
sive learning passively.All can stimulate study interest
and excavate their potential. When facing hard prob-
lems, students can easily grasp the key to solving these
problems.
4.2
Adjusting the experimental course contents
based on CDIO
The essence of CDIO is a process of “learning by
doing.” The students learn the main professional
knowledge in a specific project. So the improved
experimental course shows that the digital circuit

modules are designed in the projects. These projects
and actual demands are closely linked. Each project
requires students to learn the theory, design the pro-
gramme, and solve the actual problems. The students
can learn the characterization for each circuit and solve
the specific problems in their application in the whole
process. These cultivate the students’ project con-
sciousness. Therefore, this paper suggests arranging
experimental teaching contents and hours according
to Table 2.
The students can master usage of Quartus II, basic
operators and data types ofVHDL, basic structure and
description methods of the program design, and con-
current statements and sequential statements ofVHDL
in required experiments, which lay a foundation to
achieve elective experiments. In the elective Mod-
ule 1 the students choose two projects to complete,
which are same type of projects, and the students learn
to design more complex electronic control systems
in these projects. In elective Module 2, the students
choose one project to complete which is more com-
plex. In this project, the students learn to conceive
the design, design the program, and operate software
to implement the whole system. It can stimulate stu-
dents’study interest, improve their practical skills, and
educate their ability for creative thought.
According to the education idea of CDIO, the stu-
dents do not work alone in the elective module. They
can work in groups of two to three people. They
activelycompleteexperimentalprojectsfromselecting
the project to implementing the project; they are active
learners. The whole experimental project originates
from practical engineering projects, and the projects
are from simple to complicated and from independent
to cooperative. These can stimulate interest as much
as possible in learning in the opening circumstances.
4.3
Adjustment of teachers’role and status based
on CDIO
Some scholars have pointed out that education con-
cepts and methods of education must be changed in
the CDIO mode. Metaphorically speaking, teachers
must change their role from chef to nutritionist firstly,

the course must be changed from food to nourishment
secondly, and finally, the school must also be changed
from kitchen to nutrition room.All of these require the
teachers to be designers and to avoid using the tradi-
tional cramming method of teaching. The teachers act
as a guide to evaluate the whole learning process of
the students. All the changes can help to build the stu-
dents’ creative consciousness. The students who can
master more knowledge of related disciplines have the
ability of independent thinking, ability of engineering,
and ability of team cooperation. At the same time, this
requires teachers to constantly improve their ability in
areas such as engineering, designing the curriculum,
and assessment.
4.4
Adjustment of the examination method
based on CDIO
A set of reasonable examination methods can guar-
antee a teaching effect. Because of the characteristics
of VHD, the traditional mode of examination of the
course cannot effectively assess the actual opera-
tion and the students’ ability for using knowledge.
The examination method has three sections: usual-
time appraisal (20%), theory examination (40%), and
project appraisal (40%). Usual-time appraisal mainly
includes four parts: attendance, discussions, attitude,
and homework. The theory examination is used to
examine how the students grasp the knowledge, and it
adopts the form of a written examination. The project
appraisal is judged by the teaching team. This is a
comprehensive appraisal according to the selected
experimental project including the conception, design,
implementation,andoperationoftheproject.Thiskind
of appraisal pattern is established to evaluate the vari-
ous abilities of the students. It can also form a diversi-
form learning style. As a result, the students who have
solved concrete problems in teaching strengthen their
responsibility, collective ideas, communication skills,
and language abilities.
5
REFORMATION ACHIEVEMENTS BASED
ON CDIO
In recent years, more and more students are inter-
ested in active learning. They actively participate in
electronics clubs or unions. Some students join the
national undergraduate or university undergraduate
innovative experiments. Some were awarded second
prize and third prize for work in the National Under-
graduate Electronic Design Contest in 2013. Some
were awarded two first prizes, a second third prize,
and a third prize in Tianjin division. Others received
awards and honours in an integrated circuit design
contest in 2014.
6
CONCLUSION
In the teaching of the VHDL course, it is obvious
to improve teaching quality and stimulate students’
interest. It does not only develop students’comprehen-
sion and practical abilities, but also develops teachers’
professional skills and ethics.
The employer put forward the consistent high
praise.And they agree with this training method which
meet a requirement of enterprise. Finally, we believe
that relevant experience can help students to form
training systems of engineering quality. It can also
provide reference for related majors in Science and
Engineering.

ABSTRACT:
The education Ministry proposed the “excellent engineers education training program”, in order
to adjust the personnel training structure and promote the education teaching reform. This paper first researches
higher education, and explains the definition of excellence.Then, the new excellence consciousness is proposed.
Moreover, the paper analyses the importance and necessity of developing excellence consciousness, and the
relationship between excellent consciousness cultivation and excellent engineers training. Finally, the paper
proposes the key path for excellent engineers training based on the cultivation of excellent consciousness.

1
INTRODUCTION
The Ministry of Education proposed Excellent Engi-
neers EducationTraining Program in 2011, in order to
cultivate a large number of excellence programmes for
the industry, the world and the future, who have strong
innovation ability, adaptability to the development of
economic society and the professional abilities for the
industry. This programme is an important guidance
and demonstration for most activities, whose aims are
providing more excellence, adjusting the personnel
training structure and improving the talent training
quality, promoting the education teaching reform and
strengthening graduates’employment ability. Our gov-
ernment and universities all actively promote this pro-
gramme’s pilot implementation. The first batches of
pilottrainingstudentshaveenteredinSeptember2011.
However, the training project is still in the start-
ing and exploration stage, whose training orientation,
training standard, training mode, and training process
arestillnotsoclearinsomepart[1].Thispaperproposes
that excellence training’s key and foothold in engi-
neering practice ability, and start point should be the
training of excellence consciousness. The conscious-
ness cultivation must run through the whole process
of excellence training and should be a motive power
for the whole programme.
2
DEFINITION OF EXCELLENCE
In order to implement the program excellently, the
focus is on understanding the definition of excellence.
The word “excellence” is coming from JiangBiao
Biography which is written byYu Pu from the West Jin
dynasty. Hu Zongzuo wrote the book Friends and said
that ‘the person, who enjoys more outstanding intelli-
gence than his peers is Zhu Gege’. The Dictionary of
Modern Chinese translates this word as outstanding
and conspicuously superb.
In this programme, the definition of excellence does
not have a unifying concept according to the current
education status, and in addition there are lots of mis-
understandings of this word. For example, in some
universities, the one-sided focus on theoretical foun-
dation and basic skills exists only towards the elite and
the training is misplaced; besides, some colleges focus
on the training of practice application talents, and uni-
laterally emphasize on practical capability. Even some
teachers and professors believe that the excellence pro-
gramme can only be used for a few members of the
elites, otherwise it cannot highlight its pre-eminence.
In essence, however, education is a career, which
can shape one’s spirit and leads it towards healthy
growth. Excellence in this programme stands for the
human spirit and attitude, as well as one type of
consciousness of improving the inner quality towards
excellent personal quality.
Human’s abilities are limited, but as human beings
realizing their limits, they can surpass it and create
something new. Only because of this excellence con-
sciousness can people constantly realize their own
excellence. Generally speaking, excellence, a relative
concept based on the consciousness training, is not a
privilege belonging to a few elites, but a life status for
everyone.
141

3
CULTIVATION OF EXCELLENCE
CONSCIOUSNESS
Current researches on consciousness are multiple, and
its definitions are also different from different posi-
tions. ENCYCLOPAEDIA of CHINA (PSYCHOL-
OGY) defines consciousness as human’s unique senior
mental reflection form objective reality. Conscious-
ness is awareness activities not only including feelings,
perception, memory, imagination, and thinking, but
also more advanced than them. It regulates human
activities, and is the essence of being human. There-
fore, the consciousness is the foundation of success[3].
Excellence consciousness is an inner request of
excellence, whose manifestation forms are different
in different environment. However, different forms
are all aspiration of fully reflecting the life potential,
embodying human goals, as well as wishes of con-
stantly pursuing harmonious objects[2]. Persons with
excellence consciousness exploit life potentials, and
will always pursue the value and significance of life,
improve life quality and intelligence and realize an
individual life’s excellence.
The cultivation of excellence consciousness is the
goal of the education, especially for higher education.
We should take different approaches and means in dif-
ferentl stages of university education to awaken and
nurture students’ consciousness of excellence. In this
way, we plant consciousness of excellence in the inner
world of contemporary college students, and gradu-
ally precipitate it to the spirit and thought patterns of
excellence. Finally, the pursuit of excellence should
be a life status of consciousness Driven. This paper
proposes that the cultivation of consciousness of excel-
lence is the key purpose and foundation mission of
implementing the excellence training program.
4
EXCELLENCE TRAINING BASED ON
EXCELLENCE CONSCIOUSNESS
CULTIVATION
Napoleon Hill (1883–1969), the earliest and the great-
est scholar of modern Success Science, said that suc-
cess comes from a person who has the consciousness
of success; and failure roots in those who uncon-
sciouslyproducelosingawareness.Also,thekeytoone
becoming excellent is whether one has consciousness
of success, which means, excellence consciousness is
excellence training’s power source.
Based on the higher education personnel training,
this paper first analyses the excellence conscious-
ness training. Then it structures the excellence con-
sciousness system and finally proposes the excellence
training model based on excellence consciousness
cultivation. Excellence consciousness is one type of
self-awareness of striving for excellence.
Subdivided into the three aspects of thought,
knowledge and ability, the excellence consciousness
includes: self-consciousness, credit consciousness,
and communication consciousness, responsibility

consciousness from a thought aspect, learning con-
sciousness, problem consciousness, and innovation
consciousness from a knowledge aspect; goal con-
sciousness, action consciousness, setback conscious-
ness and success consciousness from an ability aspect.
Pelple with consciousness of excellence perfect their
ownpersonalitytraits,accumulateprofessionalknowl-
edge and create outstanding achievement from learn-
ing, cognition and practice. In the end, they grow up to
outstanding talents which conform to ethical, entrance
and inspection standards[4]. The training model is as
follows.
Excellence consciousness is the key point of excel-
lence training, which is usually not taken seriously.
The current society is impatient, seeking a quick suc-
cess; the college students follow suit.At the sometime,
the colleges and universities’ governors eagerly urge
their students to follow the existing so-called right
way, letting them stay in the passive situation, and
overlook the foundation of excellence consciousness.
However, the difference between the excellent and
ordinary is the careless consciousness. In order to cul-
tivate some excellence, consciousness plays a much
more important role than other issues. Only by per-
ception, learning, practice and self-cultivation, can
individuals realize the excellence.
5
MEASURES AND METHODS OF
EXCELLENCE TRAINING
Excellence Training Programme clearly proposes that
the stratified cultivating different engineers talents is
necessary to improve the quality of excellence, such
as site engineers, design and development engineers
andresearchengineers.Thiscultivatingactionneedsto
findjointtrainingmechanismbetweenuniversitiesand
corporations, in order to strengthen practice activities.
As Ernst·Edward·Springer proposed that personal-
ity mind awakening is the core of education, first and
foremost step of excellence training is the conscious-
ness of becoming excellent. By improving students’
awareness the programme can be much easier realised.
The implementing subjects—universities and col-
leges are necessary for the consciousness cultivation.
142

Universities and colleges are well placed to design,
organize, and reform the education models, in order to
cultivate the excellence consciousness. The practical
actions are as follows.
5.1
Reinforce the educational foundation, enlighten
rationality and morality
Because of the exam-oriented education before col-
lege, developments of rationality and virtue are not
unified, especially in some poor areas, or remote
mountain areas, where this consciousness education
has not begun. With the aim of cultivating excellence
consciousness, the programme should first encourage
studentstoshapetheirrationalityandvirtue,pursuethe
truth, beauty and goodness, and constantly transcend
themselves through edification, initiation, guidance
and elicitation forms.
Man is not born with reason and virtue, therefore
practical life and education are the two key meth-
ods used to shaping them. Excellence training should
abandon the traditional education model with knowl-
edge education as a centre, textbooks education as a
purpose, and put forward the new comprehensive edu-
cation model with a combination of rationality and
virtue, as well as a combination of practical expe-
rience and education, which guide students to adopt
critical-reflective thinking and practical ability well.
5.2
Construction of high-level teachers
Education is an action among humans, especially
among teachers. Excellence program implementation
should be launched through two aspects. On the one
hand, university education needs high level teaching
team with practical experience. Full-time or part-time
teachers should be better qualified with precious engi-
neering experience, or working experience in some of
well- known corporations.
On the other hand, teachers equipped with valuable
professional abilities, would be better placed to imple-
ment the improved education model and education
quality and thoroughly respect student’s value option.
As Socrates said that ignorance awakens personal self-
knowledge, excellent teachers should first give up the
thought that teachers are authorities on everything, and
then,usingthecommunicationswithstudentsbasedon
equal terms, guide them in the right direction in order
to awaken their excellence consciousness. Patient and
tolerant teachers appreciate the reasoning behind per-
sonal differences among students, and bravely admit
ignoranceandimperfection,whichisfavourabletostu-
dents who are cultivating excellence consciousness,
and pursuing knowledge and truth.
5.3
Curriculum system highlighting the excellence
consciousness
Curriculum is the process of teachers teaching and
students learning, which is the main carrier of talent
training. It largely shows the orientation and key points
of education and the knowledge, ability and quality
that students are enjoying. A curriculum of the excel-
lence education is set according to the requirements of
excellence education and consciousness training.
On the one hand, practices and knowledge are
two essential contents of the excellence education. It
should consist of adaption to the new era, meeting
career requirement, and improving practical abilities
at important places. Also, we should pay attention to
setting interdisciplinary curriculums, in order to cul-
tivate interdisciplinary talents. On the other hand, the
curriculum should be an effective means of students’
realizing the mental excellence and improving their
quality of life.. Courses include not only professional
knowledge, but also consciousness training, such as e
professional spirit, professional ethics, social respon-
sibility, team work spirit and communication ability.
Course system setting should be scientific and
rational, which is beneficial to awakening students’
excellence consciousness, urging them to pursue the
truth with strong interest. In the practical experiments,
the new curriculum motivates students to study with
positive, upward and striving spirit.
5.4
Implementing personalized teaching to realize
general excellence
The purpose of the program is to train outstanding tal-
ents with consciousness of excellence. Excellence is
the general character between training objectives and
training objective in common[5]. While the generality
is the same, a respect for individual development and
adoption of the individual teaching model are neces-
sary, because “Generality contained in all personality,
no personality no generality”. It is the encouragement
of personality that considerably shows person’s unique
value and outstanding abilities.
The origin and destination of education are peo-
ple, but there are differences and uniqueness between
everyone. So, it is impossible for education to stan-
dardize production. The excellence program should
more advocate the matters of personality. Only by
cherishing an individual character can the stimula-
tion of personal excellence consciousness be realized.
Based on the consciousness, students bring full play to
individual’s potential and innovation, and achieve the
excellence goal.
6
CONCLUSIONS
The excellence programme is not only training pro-
fessional mechanical talents, but also cultivation of
excellence consciousness. The current university stu-
dents are lacking the consciousness of excellence
rather than the professional knowledge, basic ability,
brilliant brain or high IQ[6]. Universities’ education
model should be based on the awakening of excellence
consciousness, combination of professional abilities
and morals, and bound practical experience with the-
ory innovation. Only in this way, can students be
cultivated to become the outstanding youths in the new
143

era. Excellence program helps students awaken the
excellence potential and realize self- transcendence.

INTRODUCTION
At present, China’s higher education in professional
settings, training programs, teaching ideas, teaching
staff and other aspects has a serious disconnect phe-
nomenon from social needs and enterprise products.
In March 2014, the Vice Minister of Education Lu
Xin said that China will revolutionize higher educa-
tion adjustment, that more than 600 local colleges
will gradually be turned to vocational and techni-
cal colleges, providing modern vocational education
that focuses on training engineers, senior technicians,
high-quality labourers, etc. [1]. The general curricu-
lum modules in colleges and universities emphasize
the basic theory of learning, relatively lacking pro-
fessional course modules and engineering practice
modules. During traditional teaching, teacher is as the
main body, materials are for the centre, weakening the
position of students, ignoring teamwork capacity and
innovative practice ability.
CDIO stands for Conceive, Design, Implement,
Operate which is proposed by Professor Edward Craw-
ley in MIT [2]. The CDIO engineering education
concept mostly takes a product, production process
and a product life cycle as a carrier, through the pro-
cess of product demand analysis, principle design,
prototype implementation until the late running to
firm students’ foundation of scientific knowledge,
develop their lifelong learning, teamwork and system
running capabilities, and cultivate students’ compre-
hensive quality ability to construct, design, implement
and run a kind of product in enterprise and social
environment [3].

THE TEACHING MODEL INQUIRY OF AN
INNOVATIVE PRACTICE TEAM BASED ON
CDIO
An innovative practice team means that under the
guidance of teachers, students participate in project
development. According to subject direction, teach-
ers absorb students who are interested joining the
research group, assigning students to develop mod-
ules of a subject, and students implement project in
accordance with the specifications so as to achieve
the purpose of joint research of teachers and students.
With the platform of province key discipline of medi-
cal informatics, Information Science and Engineering
College of Hebei North University has built more
innovative practice teams.Through practice and explo-
ration, the graduates from innovative practice teams
gained valuable skills in technical theoretical knowl-
edge, personal problem-solving skills, teamwork and
project system capacity that practice the engineering
education concept of the CDIO.
2.1
Engineering practice and specialized
knowledge learning
The university professional training programmes are
usually step by step and traditional, which cannot meet
the needs of research team.
First, the teachers start teaching straight after their
graduation without the experience of the whole prod-
uct development process, lacking the knowledge of
social and enterprise skills, and the ability of engi-
neeringpracticetraining,althoughpossessingin-depth
145

knowledge on a single discipline. The CDIO concept
makes higher demands on teachers, in a sense that
teachers need to improve the ability to integrate the-
ory with practice, involved in the related enterprises
for engineering practice, and be able to cooperate with
businesses in related fields. For nearly three years,
the teachers in the team of Information Science and
Engineering College have been involved in dozens of
large domestic and foreign software companies and
electronic technology companies for study and prac-
tice (eg. U.S. Google IT companies, Oracle (China)
Software System Ltd., GTA IT Co., Ltd., ZhongLian
Information Industry, Taiwan Chun Original Technol-
ogy Co., etc.) which have laid the practical foundation
for guiding the team building.
Second, students of the team are in different grades,
different professions and with different interests which
cannot fully meet the needs of professional theoreti-
cal knowledge on a subject. According to the CDIO
education programmes and subject contents, teach-
ers assign the related learning contents in accordance
with students’ interest orientation and professional
characteristics. During the learning process, teach-
ers communicate with students regularly, answer their
questions, guide students through a clear research area,
subjects’contents and the corresponding development
prospects, that make students participate in various
research activities in their spare time.
In order to make use of professional knowledge
and practice skills effectively in order to achieve the
purpose of innovation, a united, harmonious and coop-
erative atmosphere must be built within the team,
giving full play to the students’ individual interests,
potential abilities, and ambitions. With this kind of
atmosphere, each member will integrate himself into
the team in order to develop their interpersonal skills
and the ability to adapt to different environments.
2.2
Strengthening team engineering practice
conditions
Research laboratories at universities are important
places for cultivating innovative, complex and applied
talents, and also the incubators bases for excellent
engineers and scientific research achievements. The
CDIO concept points out that a single experimental
curriculum teaching is difficult to cultivate students’
innovative ability, so it is necessary to integrate related
laboratories and build new research practice labs in
order to develop the concept of engineering educa-
tion. With the support of the college, the research team
of the Information Science and Engineering College
has established the Internet of Things research lab, a
virtual hospital lab, a mobile internet lab and a large
data lab, etc. Using these large laboratory equipment,
studentscancombinetheoryandpracticebetter,know-
ing trends and the latest developments of the project.
Meanwhile students’ professional knowledge will be
expanded as well.
Scientific research is the process for team mem-
bers to gradually improve professional knowledge
and engineering education. While implementing these
distinctive scientific experiments, students’ abilities
of identifying and solving problems are developed
gradually, and the product development specification
becomes habitual.Through the practice in the research
laboratory, undergraduates’ research literacy of truth-
seeking, realistic, enterprising collaboration and ded-
ication is cultivated gradually, laying the foundation
for becoming an excellent engineer with corporate
standards.
2.3
The team carries out comprehensive innovative
practice in accordance with “tutorial system”
Professor Zha Jianzhong introduced the CDIO model
to the “learning by doing” study approach, and pro-
posed that “learning by doing” method will be one
of education reform strategies to cope with the indus-
trial development demands for innovative engineering
talents under the economic globalization nowadays
[4]. Here the concept of “learning by doing” and
the project-based learning model are introduced into
the innovative practice team, advocating the student-
centred to develop the engineering practice ability-
target teaching mode. Referencing the CDIO syllabus,
“we will provide students with a rich design and
implementation of the projects, so that students grasp
the theory knowledge better in case of practice and
active learning.” [5] Within the existing basic knowl-
edge and term limit, through the actual project driv-
ing, students’ ability of identifying problems, solving
problems and knowledge application is trained. Mean-
while, by project cooperation and exchange, students’
personalqualitiesarealsoimprovedwhichmakesthem
develop all-round in engineering practice.
Currently, there are medical information technol-
ogy teams, the “Internet of Things” team, a virtual
hospital team, a mobile internet team and a large data
team, etc. in our college. Each team is composed of
backbone teachers, young teachers, senior students
and junior students forming an echeloned team. The
backbone teachers directionally guide young teachers,
and both of them guide team students to conduct the
research practice, choose the right projects, and coun-
selling students in order to determine the practical and
innovative practices.
The following example is for the Internet of Things
team to illustrate the innovative practice team’s work.
Around the project design, the necessary knowledge
and skills, being oriented towards engineering prac-
tice, the two lines of hardware development and
software development are combined organically in a
team, guiding students to learn and master the practical
ability to form an effective whole. After three years of
practice, a practical knowledge system and engineer-
ing skill training scheme are formed in the team as
shown in Figure 1.
For the hardware direction, it is carried out around
hardware development of Internet ofThings and infor-
mation transmission. The specific line is shown in
Figure 2.

2.4
Team emphasis of students’science and
technology competition
Science and technology competition provide a plat-
form to display the science and technology work that
is developed by a teacher-student team, and also being
an opportunity to test the team’s achievements in sci-
entific research. It encourages students to develop
thinking methods of identifying problems, analysing
problems correctly, and dealing with problems as
well. Science and technology competition also cul-
tivates students’ interpersonal skills of cooperating
with instructors and classmates, gradually achieving
the goal of solving scientific problems independently
[6–7]. Our college actively encouraged teams to par-
ticipate in domestic and foreign high-level scientific
research competitions. The teams prepared research
works carefully, took part in many competitions
that were students-centred, and have gained excellent
results. In some influential technology contests, such
as China Software Cup, the Students Software Design
Competition and Bi Sheng Cup, the National Elec-
tronic Innovative Design Contest, the team got two
first-prizes; in the Internet of Things innovative appli-
cations designed Competition of National Colleges,
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Students Computer
Application Competition, and Chinese Students chal-
lenge of GoogleAndroid application development, the
team got three second-prizes; in smart home APP
application design contest, the team got the third
prize. In recent years, the college teams take scientific
competitions into talents training programs, making
great efforts to cultivate students’ innovation, creative
enthusiasm, and inspire their creativity continually.
2.5
Existing problems
After nearly three years of practice, the innovative
practice team of Information Science and Engineering
College has made some achievements, having a cer-
tainunderstandingoftheconceptofCDIOengineering
147

education, and having also set a suitable CDIO teach-
ing practice scheme for the team. However, there were
still some problems during the practice, mainly in the
following aspects:
2.5.1
Teachers’engineering practice ability
cultivation
Most of the teachers have certain achievements in their
respective areas of expertise, but lack practical experi-
ence and engineering experience in social and business
environment, especially for the young teachers directly
from the university. The key to the implementation
of CDIO is the need for related engineering practice
capabilities. Therefore, strengthening teachers’practi-
cal training is our top priority. One of it is that teachers
take part in short-term training in enterprise; the other
is that new teachers should enter enterprises for one
year’s engineering experience, and then begin teach-
ing at university. In this way, teachers can know the
throughout life cycle of the product which will broaden
their horizons of engineering studies [9].
2.5.2
Undergraduate business tutor appointment
In our country, doctoral, master’s academic evaluation
anddissertationaccreditationareallcarriedoutbyaca-
demic staff and entrepreneurs, so that double tutorial
system may also be adopted to foster entrepreneurial
engineering talents, in which a university teacher
would be responsible for academic guidance of the
project, and a business tutor would be responsible
for non-academic aspects. Business tutors’ joining
can promote students’ awareness of entrepreneur-
ship, business management and product development,
enhance their market sensitivity, opportunity seizing,
and interpersonal communication abilities.
2.5.3
Research project credit system
There are credits for some practical aspects in college’s
training programs such as compulsory experiments,
curriculum design, etc.; while no credits in other prac-
tical ones such as various scientific and technology
competitions, academic papers, patents, and so on. If
there are credits for these technological activities, stu-
dents’ research enthusiasm will be incentive greatly;
furthermore if there is also a minimum credit require-
ment for research, an impact on all students’scientific
literacy and innovation will be produced.
3
CONCLUSION
Afterseveralyearsofresearchandpractice,theinnova-
tive practice team has built a suitable CDIO engineer-
ing education outline, which is student-centred and
the actual project-object, expanding the practice teach-
ing contents, improving students’ scientific literacy,
arousing their enthusiasm and fully inspiring students’
activity. Through the practical research training, the
team’s knowledge of architecture has also been per-
fected, the team’s innovation has been improved, and
the students’ research interests, personal skills and
sense of teamwork have all been improved.

INTRODUCTION
From the beginning of the 21st century, China has
begun to implement the entrepreneurship education.
At the present stage, the entrepreneurship education
has been carried out in some considerable scale and
achieved preliminary results. The entrepreneurship
education, a subject with strong practical character-
istic, aims to cultivate the students’ entrepreneurial
ability.The entrepreneurship education has become an
important concept and component of China’s higher
education. How to carry out the entrepreneurship edu-
cation and improve college students’ entrepreneurial
ability has been a hot topic researched extensively
among scholars. Some scholars have reached a con-
sensus in their researches based on tacit knowledge
theory. The exploration of tacit knowledge theory and
the research on it has to some extent promoted the
development of the entrepreneurship education in col-
leges and universities. However, it is not easy to put
the theory into practice. The entrepreneurship educa-
tion research in college and university based on the
tacit knowledge theory need a process to be estab-
lished and implemented.There are still some problems
in the entrepreneurship education research in college
and university.
This thesis attached emphasis to research on prob-
lems of China’s entrepreneurship education in colleges
and universities in the present stage based on tacit
knowledge theory. And it presents the author’s opin-
ions on the development of China’s entrepreneurship
educationresearchincollegesanduniversitiesinterms
of the concept and goal of entrepreneurship educa-
tion, teaching method, curriculum system, practice
platform, and social support mechanism, etc.

TACIT KNOWLEDGE THEORY
In 1958, Michael Polanyi, the British physicist and
philosopher, in his “Personal Knowledge”, states for
the first time the tacit knowledge theory. Polanyi
believed the human knowledge could fall into two cat-
egories: the first category is called explicit knowledge,
which could be described by written words, chart and
mathematical formula and could be combined, stored,
looked for again and converted into related practice
by different mechanism. It is characterized by normal-
ization and systematization. It is easy to communicate
andsharewithpeoplethatexplicitknowledge.Another
category, which is called tacit knowledge, is rooted
in individual and his mental model. By contrast with
the former, it is difficult to be code and communi-
cate with. Technical, restricted by circumstances, it
belongs to personal experience which is hard to share
with others. Highly personal and hard to standardized
are characteristics of tacit knowledge.
Comparedwiththeexplicitknowledge,itisdifficult
to clearly express or to formulate the tacit knowl-
edge. By some ways, it can be put into words. It is
a highly personal knowledge which is individual and
149

private. It has not been or never could be described via
formulation, but could only be combined by unsystem-
atic fragmentary knowledge unconcerned by people,
which could be understood in an integral manner.
To acquire the tacit knowledge, compared with the
explicit one, more practice is needed for the subject of
knowledge, which can be interpreted as an experience
that demands person in the scene or an understand-
ing process. To grasp the skill well and to realize the
deep connotation of the tacit knowledge, it is necessary
for the subject of knowledge to practice and practice
again. Meanwhile, in the process of acquiring tacit
knowledge, some uncertain or diversified factors may
restrict the subject of knowledge. The mutual conver-
sion between tacit knowledge and explicit one could
only be accomplished under some certain condition.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TACIT
KNOWLEDGE THEORY AND
ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION
The research on tacit knowledge theory has opened up
a new perspective of entrepreneurship education, and
promotes the development of entrepreneurship educa-
tion. To do a deep research on tacit knowledge theory
and look for new method of entrepreneurship tacit
knowledge are of great importance for the develop-
ment of entrepreneurship education research in college
and university.
The past psychological theory believed that, knowl-
edge and ability belong to two categories which
interact with each other. While, Robert Sternberg, the
American psychologist believed there was an over-
lap between knowledge and ability. This overlap is
just the tacit knowledge. Therefore, the cultivation
of entrepreneurial spirit and entrepreneurial ability
to a large degree comes from the generation and
acquisition of entrepreneurship tacit knowledge. A
considerable part of entrepreneurial abilities belong
to the category of tacit knowledge, such as to grasp
the business opportunity, to identify entrepreneurial
project, to form the business groups, to grasp the
entrepreneurial inspiration, to integrate the resources
and to coordinate the relationships, etc. The main goal
of entrepreneurship education research in college and
university is to cultivate the entrepreneurial abilities of
college students, rather than to view the survival and
growth of pioneering enterprise as the only target.
The theory that the knowledge type decides the
course type and teaching method has been recognized
extensively by educators. There are lots of differences
between the explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge
in terms of educational aim, teaching content, teach-
ing method, evaluation standard, etc.Therefore, during
the implementation of the entrepreneurship education,
the traditional teaching method which gives priority to
lecture in class has met with great challenge.The tacit-
ness, individuality, situationality, integrity and cultural
feature of tacit knowledge demand the subject of
knowledge to take part in the comprehensive prac-
tice activity under certain situation as a supporting
platform whether in the stage of acquiring knowl-
edge or in combing and converting stages. In this
way, the individual can comprehend and transform
the world.Thus, entrepreneurship education in college
and university should be implemented on the basis of
practical knowledge rather than on the basis of theo-
retical knowledge, which is a starting point to ponder
over comprehensively the entrepreneurship education
system in college and university.

PROBLEMS FOR THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP
EDUCATION FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS
BASED ON TACIT KNOWLEDGE
4.1
The tacit knowledge theory has not infiltrated
into the concept of entrepreneurship education
Influenced by the traditional teaching method, and
restricted by the traditional teaching resources,
entrepreneurship education in colleges and universi-
ties usually put emphasis on the teaching of explicit
knowledge rather than tacit knowledge. Under the
influence of such education concept, most of col-
leges and universities set up the training system of
entrepreneurship education according to the trans-
ferring pattern of explicit knowledge, and treat
entrepreneurial knowledge and ability as a kind of
explicit knowledge. The acquisition and transforma-
tion of tacit knowledge has not been given in-depth
understanding. The entrepreneurship education has
not been well combined with discipline construction
and talent training scheme, and has not conformed to
the college students’ growing pattern. Besides, some
one-sided ideas have derived from this entrepreneur-
ship education concept, such as, entrepreneurship
education in colleges and universities are nothing but
entrepreneur education or entrepreneurship education
aims to cultivate the students into business bosses, etc.
4.2
The teaching method based on tacit knowledge
has not been fully implemented
According to the features of tacit knowledge, the
explicit knowledge acquired by the students from the
receiving-type teaching is dispersed, which requires
the subject of knowledge to integrate with the tacit
knowledge acquired from experience-teaching and
inquiry learning approach. Thus, in entrepreneurship
education, the experience-teaching and inquiry learn-
ing approach which call for subject of knowledge
to take part positively are good for the college stu-
dents to acquire tacit knowledge for entrepreneurship.
Many colleges and universities have paid attention to
the importance of the subject of knowledge’s partic-
ipation in entrepreneurship education. However, the
extent and depth of such participation have not been
achieved well enough. The main teaching method
has still been receiving-type approach. The subject
150

of knowledge has not been fully engaged in teaching
process. In short, the above mentioned factors lead to
an insufficient acquisition of the tacit knowledge of
entrepreneurship education of college students. The
college students will not be guaranteed to be able to
transfer the knowledge into abilities in experience-
teaching environment, which harms the effect of
entrepreneurship education.
4.3
The practice link which reflect the
internalization and transformation of tacit
knowledge is weak
Due to the fact that tacit knowledge is understand-
ings and experiences acquired by subject of knowledge
via participating in and doing practice in specific
situations, practice is the primary channel for col-
lege students to gain the entrepreneurial ability. In
recent years, some colleges and universities have set
up several entrepreneurship training base by cooper-
ating with enterprises, trying to create a real market
scene offering tacit knowledge of starting a business.
By doing that, the college students’ entrepreneurial
ability could be transferred and improved. At present,
most of the college students lack opportunities of
entrepreneurial practice. But owing to the limitation to
the scale of school training resources and practice base
outside school, most of the entrepreneurship education
in colleges and universities has been carried out in
campus, which allows only a small number of college
students to participate in the training. More often than
not, only a very few people are starting an undertaking,
while the most are just waiting and seeing.
4.4
Multidisciplinary entrepreneurship education
curriculum system which reflect tacit
knowledge has not been implemented
The integrity, diversity and complexity of tacit knowl-
edge of entrepreneurship decide the multidisciplinary
feature of entrepreneurship education curriculum sys-
tem. In recent years, some colleges and universities
have come to realize the importance of entrepreneur-
ship education curriculum with multidisciplinary and
open features. Diverse and interdisciplinary curricu-
lum resources and teachers have been introduced to
educate and train the students’ entrepreneurial ability
in a comprehensive way. In general, the entrepreneur-
ship education curriculum system in most colleges
and universities still features a strong disciplinary
independence. The entrepreneurship education cur-
riculum system has not reflected the integration of
entrepreneurship education with professional educa-
tion, scientific education with humanistic education.
The teachers of entrepreneurship education are not
diverse. A separation between entrepreneurship edu-
cation and general education, professional education
has greatly influenced the students’ acquiring of tacit
knowledge of entrepreneurship education.

THE DIRECTION OF DEVELOPMENT OF
CHINA’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP
EDUCATION IN COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES BASED ON TACIT
KNOWLEDGE
5.1
To ensure the concept and goal of
entrepreneurship education based on tacit
knowledge
Colleges and universities should notice the features
and follow the rule of tacit knowledge in its for-
mation and break the traditional training model of
entrepreneurship education, integrating tacit knowl-
edge into the concept of entrepreneurship education.
And a scientific and comprehensive theory is needed
to instruct entrepreneurship education. An innovation
mechanism including system preparation and resource
integration is in urgent need. The traditional teaching
methods featuring transmitting of explicit knowledge
have to be changed to advocate the participation of
subject of knowledge. By this way, combined with
an interdisciplinary and open curriculum system, a
practice platform, plus various resources, a training
system aiming at cultivate college students’innovative
spirit; innovative consciousness and innovative abil-
ity could be implemented to accord with the acquiring
and transferring pattern of entrepreneurship education
tacit knowledge.
5.2
To adopt the teaching method based on tacit
knowledge
Inordertoimprovethecollegestudents’entrepreneurial
ability based on tacit knowledge, students’ active par-
ticipation and firsthand experience should be attached
emphasis to in the entrepreneurship education. More
real or simulated scenes should be created for stu-
dents and more experience-teaching models should be
adopted. Besides that, some other teaching methods
or approaches should also be taken into consideration.
Such as case teaching method or master-to-apprentice
mentoring system can both be adopted in classroom
teaching.
Case teaching is an effective way to transferring
tacit knowledge of entrepreneurship education. The
selected business cases explained by teachers in sim-
ple languages can reproduce the concrete problem
situation in entrepreneurial process, which enables
the student to more easily grasp necessary knowl-
edge to start a business and to comprehend the
entrepreneurial skills from this. Master-to-apprentice
mentoring system can be also applied to learn tacit
knowledge of entrepreneurship education. Some suc-
cessful entrepreneurs will be employed and invited to
act as mentors for college students who can under-
stand the entrepreneurial skills through the inter-
action between the masters and apprentices, gain
all-round instruction in entrepreneurial activity pro-
cess. Those employed entrepreneurs can both teach
entrepreneurial knowledge and share experience of
solving problems in starting a business.
151

5.3
To establish an open and interdisciplinary
entrepreneurship education curriculum system
Entrepreneurship education should be linked with
individuality education. College students’ individu-
ality, interest and learning characteristics should be
respected. An multivariate, layered education model
should be set up, which could be achieved by imple-
menting general entrepreneurship education in junior
grades and carrying out elite education in senior
grades,andsettingupacorrespondinglyopenandmul-
tidimensional entrepreneurship education curriculum
system. The interdisciplinary feature of entrepreneur-
ship education curriculum meets the requirement of
acquisitionoftacitknowledge,whichcanhelpstudents
to grasp the multidisciplinary theory and knowledge
needed for entrepreneurship and even achieve mas-
tery.Therefore, entrepreneurship education in colleges
and universities should be based on interdisciplinary
system, integrate various aspects of knowledge, orga-
nize teaching content revolving around the problems
in the entrepreneurial process, and introduce multidi-
mensional, interdisciplinary curriculum resource and
teachers.
5.4
To build entrepreneurial practice platform with
multi-subject participation
Entrepreneurialpracticeandscenesimulationaremain
ways to acquire tacit knowledge of entrepreneurship
education. Owing to the limitation to entrepreneurial
resources
and
fund,
in
the
primary
stage
of
entrepreneurship education, colleges and universities
can concentrate all their efforts on building incubator
part in campus to breed, hatch and support the college
students’ entrepreneurial team. Having brought the
mature entrepreneurship project into market, colleges
and universities could make a further step by building
a larger entrepreneurial platform united with enter-
prises, public welfare institutions and government.
Some colleges and universities with better condition
may make full use of their facilities to build Sci-
ence and Technology Industrial Park in campus to
offer support to the students’ entrepreneurial team in
their project selection, fund raising, market promotion
and human capital, etc. Those schools will accumu-
late experience and resources step by step, search
for cooperating institutes outside school and build
entrepreneurial practice platform system with multi-
subject participation to offer all-round, multivariate
breeding service to students’ entrepreneurial team.
5.5
To form a mass-participation entrepreneurial
supporting mechanism for college students
As the tacit knowledge of entrepreneurship mainly
comes from specific experience, only classroom activ-
ities and limited social practices can hardly guarantee
the acquisition of it. It is the common responsibility
of colleges and universities and the whole soci-
ety to cultivate undergraduates equipped with rich
entrepreneurial practical knowledge and abilities.
Their success can promote employment and economic
growth; create common wealth for the whole society.
Thus, it is necessary to form a benefit sharing mech-
anism for entrepreneurship education in colleges and
universities which is led by government and partic-
ipated by the whole society. And it is important to
construct an entrepreneurial environment encouraging
entrepreneurship and tolerating failures, with govern-
ment, colleges and universities, enterprises, and social
welfare institutions, etc. participating in the activi-
ties to cultivate entrepreneurial abilities of students. A
social service system can thus be constructed to give
support to college students’ innovative undertaking.
6
CONCLUSION
Faced with new opportunities and challenges of social
development, the major task of China’s entrepreneur-
ship education in colleges and universities is to do
research on the generation and transformation pat-
terns of entrepreneurship tacit knowledge and to
form entrepreneurship education concept and goal
based on tacit knowledge, to build an entrepreneur-
ship education system improving the college students’
entrepreneurial abilities.
The relationship between tacit knowledge theory
and entrepreneurship education is a problem demand-
ing much more deep research of scholars. Due to the
author’s limited knowledge and experience, the state-
ment on the relationship between the two has not
covered all the points. The thesis presents the author’s
opinions based on the working practice in university
and some reference documentation. Readers’valuable
advice are welcomed and hoped.

Look at the existing problems of cultivating talents in Hebei Province
for the use of foreign language—The necessity of adopting
a new foreign language education policy
Limin Liu & Jinfen Yue
College of Foreign Languages, Agricultural University of Hebei, Baoding, China
ABSTRACT:
In order to obtain details of college graduates in Hebei Province in the foreign language use
and provide a data support in personnel training, the research group launched a survey of questionnaires among
graduates and employers.The questionnaire results show the use of a foreign language differs in occupations and
employers have different requirements for graduates’ language ability. In view of this situation, it is necessary
to consider the problems of educating language talents, and discuss the necessity and urgency of adopting a new
foreign policy in teaching college English.

INTRODUCTION
In order to get first-hand material of information on
college students’ use of foreign languages (mostly
English) after graduation, a research group of five
teachers and ten students from Agricultural Univer-
sity of Hebei conducted a questionnaire survey in the
summer of 2013 in the two cities of Shijiazhuang and
Baoding, among ninety five graduates who had fin-
ished college studies within the last three years. The
questionnaire results showed that these graduates are
quite different in using English, mostly connected to
their respective professional directions, gender, and
occupations. Whereas the overall situation is satis-
factory, most employers have stronger requirements
for English abilities from the recruited members.
The Ministry of Education in 2010 promulgated the
national long-term education reform and development
plan (2010–2020), in which it clearly put forward the
idea “to cultivate a large number of language talents
with profound international vision, familiar with inter-
national rules, and active in international affairs and
competition” [1]. According to the questionnaire, it
is necessary to modify and revise the current foreign
languageeducationpolicy,inordertomeettherequire-
ments of cultivating talents in the changing society.

A STUDENT QUESTIONNAIRE
The student questionnaire includes options and self-
statements. Ten questions are given to cover a wide
range of fields, relating to respondents’ gender, age,
graduation school, time spent on learning English,
evaluation of foreign language abilities, and use of
foreign languages at work. Besides, the students are
also required to state their views on foreign language
use and their regrets in the learning process. Finally,
they give suggestions to college students on how to
learn a foreign language.
2.1
The questionnaire results roughly fall into three
categories
2.1.1
Questionnaire results in five institutions
In the five institutions surveyed, mostly schools, gov-
ernment organizations and so on, 25 students (100%)
in order to get a title or to go abroad, or to visit or
travel, will continue to use English (learning). When
talking about regrets in learning English, 70% of the
respondents choose to “master basic listening, reading,
writing, and translation skills, while the actual use of
English in real life is rare”. As an advice to college
students, 90% graduates think that “students should
practice English more and learn the Western culture at
school”.
2.1.2
Questionnaire results obtained at eleven
enterprises and companies
In the survey of eleven enterprises or companies,
mostly computer, clothing, medicine, real estate, auto-
mobile and logistics, the foreign language use has
obvious practical features. Among the fifty respon-
dents, there is a great relationship between the foreign
language use and the nature of their work. Thirty
two of them engaged in design, drug development,
circulation, services, trade and other fields will use
English 100%.Ten of them are engaged in assembling,
packing, transportation, production, the ratio of using
English is 20%. Eight of the administrative person-
nel will actively learn and use the language. When the
fifty respondents are required to state their “regrets”
in English learning, 80% of them think they only
grasped the basic skills in learning, speaking, reading
153

and writing, but rarely used them in reality. In addi-
tion, almost all of them expressed the wish for cultural
training, customs, and beliefs of the foreign language.
In the advice column, 90% of the respondents suggest
“more learning of the spoken English and the Western
culture at school”.
2.1.3
Questionnaire results of twenty individuals
and unemployed graduates
According to the survey of twenty individuals and
unemployed graduates, their foreign language use fol-
low their career development, and next study for a
further promotion. Interest in English learning starts
from the very beginning at school, with two divi-
sions of either continuing or quitting totally. Of the
ten unemployed graduates surveyed, nine believe that
it is necessary to learn English in order to find a job or
pursue a postgraduate study. Of the 1ten self-employed
graduates,sixhavevagueideasofEnglishlearningand
the English they learned at school seems forgotten.
Of them, four will not learn English unless traveling
abroad or visiting.
2.2
Characteristics of a foreign language use
2.2.1
The nature of occupation determines the
efficiency and extension of the foreign
language use
Graduates engaged in foreign businesses, such as
the overseas sales department of Baoding Great Wall
Motors, use English at work.Their abilities and knowl-
edge become rich and extensive with their working
experience. Graduates in organizations or institutions,
such as teaching, secretarial, administrative and other
fields, use English in a small range with low efficiency,
but experiences like studying abroad or competing in
a work situation can improve their initiative of learn-
ing English. Among the unemployed graduates and
postgraduates, the foreign language use differs from
man to man. English remains in use mostly as a tool
and it seems to be of little value for intercultural
communication.
2.2.2
From a “book type” to “practical”
The questionnaire results show that companies
engaged in foreign trade use English extensively,
mostly for foreign trade services (reception, corre-
spondence, negotiation, etc.), foreign language mate-
rials, studying abroad, report writing etc. Take Great
Wall Motors and North China Pharmaceutical Fac-
tory as an example, among the twenty three grad-
uates engaged in overseas trade, six graduates in
North China Pharmaceutical have once gone abroad
to participate in training or meetings, while fifteen
graduates in Baoding Great Wall Motors are mostly
engaged in automobile export and new product devel-
opment.These twenty one graduates found difficulties
in adapting to a foreign language situation, espe-
cially in oral communication and data translation, as
well as grammatical structure of language data. When
they are required to comment on “regrets”, they all
mentioned the cultural shock, namely confusion and
embarrassment in intercultural communications. The
knowledge they learned in English books becomes real
and meaningful with their deeper involvement with
a foreign culture. After using English for a while,
they become very skilful and confident in language
communication and reading accuracy.
2.2.3
(FL+professional) compound talents
Compound talents (FL+professional) are essential
workforce resources for China’s international devel-
opment. Among the ninety five respondents, self-
employed and postgraduates excluded from the group,
there are fifteen foreign language majors and sixty
non-majors. Of the fifteen majors, eleven in national
institutions, three in foreign trade correspondence and
one full-time English interpreter. Of the sixty non-
majors, fourteen were in institutions, twenty nine
engaged in foreign trade correspondence, sales, logis-
tics, product research and development, ten in pack-
aging and transportation, and seven as the company’s
administrative class. Obviously, foreign language tal-
ents no longer equate “foreign language majors”, and
compound talents of foreign language majors and
“professional + language” for non- foreign language
majors mode, and are more in line with China’s inter-
nationalization development. It should also be noticed
that of the ninety five graduates, those frequently using
English account for 42%, those occasionally using
English account for 40%, and less than 20% of the
graduates never use English.

AN EMPLOYER QUESTIONNAIRE
3.1
Questionnaire design
154

3.2
Analysis of questionnaire results
Theemployerssurveyedincludegovernmentorganiza-
tions, national institutions, big provincial companies,
as well as foreign investment enterprises.
The above questionnaire indicates that these
employers surveyed have different requirements for
graduates of foreign language use. Companies with
foreign businesses require more of English level grad-
uates, while schools and the government require a
relatively small number.
3.2.1
Great expectations of high-quality talents
The employers surveyed had great expectations for
graduates of a foreign language use. 78% of the
employers required that graduates should obtain a high
level of the English language ability, 17% required
an advanced level of the English language ability,
including listening, speaking, reading, writing and
translation, etc.With the development of China’s inter-
nationalization, many companies open international
businesses, thus needing high-quality English talents.
3.2.2
General satisfaction with the English
language abilities
The employers surveyed felt satisfied with graduates’
language abilities. 64% of the employers felt satis-
fied, while only 3% felt perfectly satisfied. On the
one hand, China’s college English language education
has achieved success to some degree, on the other
hand, there are still deficiencies in cultivating for-
eign language talents, such as excessive emphasis on
knowledge and ignorance of practical abilities.
3.2.3
More specific demands for the English
language abilities
Requirements for graduates of the English language
abilities tend to be more specific. 66% the employ-
ers required that graduates should have listening
and speaking abilities, as well as the intercultural
communicative competence. 78% of the respondents
required that graduates have a strong professional
ability and foreign language abilities in the recruit-
ment. 95% of the employers required that graduates
have higher domestic and international communi-
cation abilities. A compound type of talents with
a professional + English and the international con-
sciousness continues to sell well in the market, which
also shows the cultivation of English talents in our
country should take the market demand as a criterion,
timely adjusting the direction of personnel training.
4
TWO QUESTIONNAIRES INTEGRATED TO
MANIFEST PROBLEMS
4.1
Reform out-dated foreign language education
policy and emphasize culture in cultivation
The formulation of foreign language education pol-
icy is restricted by two aspects of factors, the internal
being the inherent law of foreign language education
while the external being globalization and national
development needs [2].
College English Teaching Requirements has been
implemented for ten years, and with China’s interna-
tionalization, some problems begin to appear. Among
the ninety five graduates, those who often use English
account for 42%. When asked about regrets and
advice, the “cultural confusion” is most often men-
tioned. For example, graduates experienced embar-
rassment in dealing with foreigners, and knew little
about the taboos, etiquette, customs etc.Teachers often
put too much emphasis on basic language skills, and
ignore the penetration of cultural knowledge, the result
of which is that students are skilful in the language use
but ignorant in the cultural background. The coexis-
tence of language and culture has been for so long
ignored, leading to the loss in intercultural knowledge
in college English education [3].
4.2
Lay solid foundation for talent cultivation and
formulate global education policy
With the rapid development of the Internet, the
Chinese multinational enterprises and the strong
appeal for China’s participation in the international
stage, China is in great need of a foreign language
education policy, which is also the premise and guar-
antee to further promote the internationalization of
China. In this regard, it is worthwhile to draw lessons
from the USA, Japan, South Korea and other countries.
America promulgated a language policy including a
foreign language ability standard and the education
funding system, which carries multiple educational
goals to meet a deep political, economic target [4].
Japan, in implementing the foreign policy, gradually
has shown “pragmatism” tendency. Students can study
English according to their own needs, interest and
ability. The aim is to cultivate “Japanese who can
use English” [5]. The South Korean government has
always seen the national English level as an impor-
tant factor to participate in international competition
and promoting the economic development. The for-
mer president Lee Myung-bak in his inaugural address
proposed “to greatly enhance the school English edu-
cation”, emphasizing that “English ability is the key
to encouraging international investments to Korean
enterprises.” [6] The internationalization of China
makes it urgent to formulate policies to keep pace
with the times. Based on curriculum requirements,
a new policy is aimed at developing an international
awareness and cultivating compound language talents.
4.3
Combine schools, students and markets to
cultivate English talents
Cultivation of English talents is an effective guarantee
of China’s international development and an impor-
tant scale to measure the national quality. “A national
language popularization degree often reflects the inter-
national consciousness of its citizens, the degree of
155

internationalization, and the development prospect of
the future …[7]”.
To cultivate talents, we must effectively combine
schools, students and market demands. Demand-
production-supply will make a sound circle to fulfill
a national goal of talents cultivation. For example,
in 2013, a Hebei pharmaceutical company specified
requirements for intensive English in its notice of
staff recruiting in the fields of chemical engineering
and technology. North China Pharmaceutical Group
and Peking University, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Meiji Seika,America Chiron Company, etc. have close
cooperation in the establishment of Microbial Engi-
neering Research Center, national drug antibody drug
development of State Key, Laboratory of National
Research and Development, and a postdoctoral scien-
tific research workstation. Workers in Baoding Great
Wall Motors, in the course of transition from the
pickup to SUV, translated into English and studied
“68 details of fine management in Toyota Business
School”. Requirements for English talents grow with
internationalization.
4.4
Guarantee the future development
China’s growing internationalization provides a solid
soil for cultivating English talents, and has produced
unexpected results. For example, Confucius Colleges
have attracted more than 100 million overseas stu-
dents today, compared with 30 million ten years ago.
Chinese Bridge, a competition show for foreign stu-
dents in China to compete in Chinese language, gets
more attention today. Chinese multinational com-
panies have been built overseas. Chinese Teachers
Working Abroad greatly promotes exchanges between
China and the world. Formulation of foreign educa-
tion policy should adapt to the changed situations and
further enhance and revise the old, rigid stereotypes.
It is crucial for teachers to build confidence in their
students and teach them the values of autonomous
learning. A harmonious atmosphere should be built
to encourage people to learn, use, and speak English
happily.
5
CONCLUSION
Hebei province is located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
Economic Zone. Its graduates render services mostly
in this area. Talent cultivation cannot do without inter-
national foreign policy guidance, so universities and
employing units should pay great attention to this
fact, in order to adapt to China’s current situation.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education, as the ultimate
authority on foreign education policy formulation and
issues, should widely collect information on reforms
and, in conjunction with experts, scholars, outstand-
ing teachers and institutions, work at the formulation
of a new education policy, effectively implement-
ing people-oriented philosophies, and contributing to
a rounded scientific development, with the aim to
improve the development of the economy, society, and
human beings.

ABSTRACT:
College English Curriculum Requirements has been issued for more than ten years until now.
Under its guidance, university English teaching has cultivated a large amount of foreign language talent.
The Agricultural University of Hebei has been strictly abiding by its provisions. With the internationaliza-
tion of China and its increasing demand for foreign language talent, there is a need to revise the Curriculum
Requirements. It can be used to correct certain teaching notions and guide the work in management and
teaching.

INTRODUCTION
Since the expansion of college enrolment in 1999,
in order to regulate college English teaching, the
State Ministry of Education issued the college English
curriculum requirements in 2004 (on trial), put for-
ward three requirements of cultivating foreign lan-
guage talents, that is, the general requirements, higher
requirements, and even higher requirements [1]. With
the progress of our education and higher educa-
tion reform, the Ministry of Education in October
2007 formally promulgated the university English
teaching requirements (hereinafter referred to as
the requirements), clearly put forward the univer-
sity English teaching goal as training the students
“comprehensive ability of using English, especially
listening and speaking ability, so that they can use
English to communicate effectively in the future
study, work and social contacts, and enhance their
ability of autonomous learning, improve the com-
prehensive cultural literacy in order to adapt to the
need of China’s social development and international
exchanges [2].”
Until today, curriculum requirements has been
implemented for nearly ten years (from the start of
trial), University English teaching has made huge
achievements, but there are some problems. The Agri-
cultural University of Hebei has been paying attention
to English teaching of the students, the ongoing class-
roompracticeandteachingreform,inordertocultivate
the national and social needs of the talents of foreign
languages.
2
MAKE CLEAR THE CONCEPTUAL ISSUES
OF FOREIGN TALENTS AND IMPLEMENT
THE CURRICULUM REQUIREMENTS
2.1
Foreign language talents under college English
education
Traditionally, a talent is a brilliant man of wide learn-
ing. The Ministry of education in the Outline of the
National Medium and Long Term Talent Develop-
ment Plan (2010–2020) pointed out that the talent
is “to have certain professional knowledge or special
skills, creative work and make a contribution to the
society. Talent is the ability of workers and high qual-
ity of human resources. Talent is the first resource
in economic and social development of China [3].”
When it refers to the foreign language talents, certain
English professional knowledge or special skills are
required.
Here, it needs to clarify the three kinds of for-
eign language talents. Only with a clear concept,
will a definite object in view be set as to the talent
cultivation.
2.1.1
Narrow sense of foreign language talents
The narrow sense of foreign language talents. It refers
to specialties in languages and literature, or profes-
sional translators. They are mostly engaged in a study
of foreign languages, of Western literature or liter-
ary translation, of interpretation and other aspects of
such works. They are the elite of foreign language tal-
ents, truly representative of a nation’s foreign language
157

level. Such figures, a modern foreign language
teaching and research authority figures are, for exam-
ple, Yang Xianyi, Dai Weidong, Hu Wenzhong, etc.
2.1.2
Broad sense of foreign language talents
The broad sense of foreign language talent is the
combination of modern English major and market
demands. Personnel training should be meet market
requirements. This kind of foreign language talents,
mastering a foreign language, receiving education or
training on foreign trade, secretarial specialty, tourism,
etc., are engaged in language related occupations after
graduation. They are among the most popular com-
pound applied talents of foreign languages. Because
of the specialty of targeted fields, compared with
the characteristics of narrow foreign language talents,
mostly engaged in academies and research, they are
more widely distributed in society. These talents are
the most vigorously trained versatile foreign language
personnel at present in our country. This kind of tal-
ents are mostly engaged in foreign trade, translation
and other social work, whereas in the academic circle
they are seldom found.
2.1.3
Mass type of foreign language talents
The object of teaching English at university are all
collegestudents.Theirpre-schooleducationgavethem
a certain foreign language foundation and university
English education only added to training them into
useful foreign language talents in our society.They use
English skilfully in study, work and life, and contribute
to our society with their talents. One of the guiding
people of modern Enlightenment, shipping expertYan
Fu, China’s supreme merit award winner, expert in “the
two bombs and one satellite”, and a scientist Tsien
Hsueshen, are examples worth having in mind. They
are not engaged in foreign languages, but have made
great contributions by using a foreign language. This
is what our country cultivates to render social services
nowadays.
2.2
English education at university should
conscientiously implement the curriculum
requirements
2.2.1
Releasing goal
Curriculum requirements was released with the inten-
tion to fully implement college English teaching
reform and to meet the needs of talents cultiva-
tion in the state and society in the new era. The
nature of college English teaching is summarized as
“guided by foreign language teaching theories, and
with English language knowledge and application of
skills, intercultural communication and learning strat-
egy as the main content, uniting many kinds of teach-
ing models and methods into an integrated teaching
system.”
The Agricultural University of Hebei, as a provin-
cial agriculture and forestry university, recruits large
numbers of students every year. How to do well in
collegeEnglishteaching,isnotonlyrelatedtotheover-
all development of the university, but will affect the
overall quality of college students in Hebei province.
This year’s enrolment in school has reached 12230
students. In cultivation of these students, we should
seriously carry out the curriculum requirements in
English teaching, and fully implement the reform.
With the teaching theory as the instruction, it is neces-
sary to meet current national and social demands for
foreign languages talents, which is also an obligation
of every English teacher.
2.2.2
Three levels of requirements
According to the curriculum requirements, English
teachingattheuniversitystageisdividedintothreelev-
els, namely, the general requirements, higher require-
ments, and even higher requirements. This is the stan-
dard that non-English major undergraduates should
reach after studying and practicing English at univer-
sity. The comprehensive ability of three requirements
includes: 1. listening comprehension; 2. oral expres-
sion; 3. reading comprehension; 4. writing ability; 5.
translation skills; 6. recommended vocabulary. Col-
lege English teaching material is written under the six
specific capacity requirements.
The foreign language teaching material that the
Agricultural University of Hebei uses is New Hori-
zons (designed and written closely to the spirit of the
curriculum requirement, whose language skills, lan-
guage application, and the language culture embodies
the basic requirements of the foreign language course,
not only as an instrument of learning language, but
also culture.) It provides a learning platform [4] for
all the college students in learning English. University
English teaching of Agricultural University of Hebei
can be divided into three levels: undergraduate class
two, class three and technical level, according to the
principle of “teach students in accordance with their
aptitude”, which focus on teaching in a different cul-
ture and different direction, respectively, to the three
kinds of talent requirements. The English class teach-
ing of undergraduates class two is divided into two
different levels, A and B. The two levels are deter-
mined at the beginning of the new semester after a
mass English exam, and restructured after the semester
ends. The purpose of construction and reconstruc-
tion is to adapt to the students’ changing situation
and to encourage and guide the students to learn
initiatively.
2.2.3
Curricula of Agricultural University of Hebei
The curriculum requirements put a particular empha-
sis on “giving full consideration to the cultivation of
listening and speaking abilities”, and giving students
enough time and credit. Moreover, it highlights that the
university English curriculum should “give full con-
sideration to students’ cultural quality cultivation and
international cultural knowledge.” This requirement
takes into consideration the fact that the Chinese inter-
nationalizationprocesshasgreatlyacceleratedandthat
158

China hugely focuses on the internationalization of
foreign language talents.
English teaching curricula of the Agricultural Uni-
versity of Hebei include the New Horizons series,
namely, the reading and writing courses, an extensive
reading course, comprehensive training, and an audio-
visual tutorial. In order to improve students’ listening
and speaking abilities, in the year 2013, the exten-
sive listening and vocabulary handbooks are added
to the original teaching curricula. What is more, the
school radio station also broadcasts listening pro-
grammes at certain times. Frankly speaking, a lot more
work has been done to build a better course system
in the cultivation of students’ listening and speak-
ing abilities. However, it needs to be pointed out that
students’listening and speaking abilities will not natu-
rally improve by doing some textbook homework, and
they also needs teachers’ guidance in the classroom.
As to the cultivation of students’ international knowl-
edge and intercultural quality, our school also needs
to make further research and improvement in the cur-
riculum system, teaching requirements, and training
of teachers.
2.2.4
Learning assessment and evaluation
The Curriculum requirements clarify students’ learn-
ing assessments, which includes a formative assess-
ment and a summative assessment. Of the two, the for-
mative assessment is introduced with more details and
it claims that it “is conducive to students’autonomous
learning process and effectively monitored”. At the
same time, the formative assessment can “use class-
room activities and record of extracurricular activities,
online autonomous learning record and other forms for
the pro-curatorial, evaluation and supervision in stu-
dents’ learning process in order to achieve effective
learning.”
Englishevaluationinourcollegeisacombinationof
a formative assessment and a summative assessment,
a comprehensive evaluation system of teachers, class-
room, and network. In university English final exam,
a course score accounts for 20%, and other compre-
hensive ability test scores account for 80%, which, as
a summative assessment, examine students’ listening,
reading, writing, and translation abilities. The course
score usually comprises four results, namely, class
attendance, students answering questions and positive
attitude, quizzes, and homework completion. In order
to prevent teachers from giving points that are too high
ortoolow,eachclassusuallymakesadistributionratio,
such as the 90–95 accounts for 10%, 80–89 accounts
for 40%, 70–79 accounts for 40%, 60–69 accounts
for 10%, and specific adjustment is made according
to specific circumstances, such as 0 attendance usu-
ally deserves 0, and so on. Internet testing (iTest)
and a new platform of English teaching and learn-
ing system have been introduced since the year 2013.
It not only helps students form autonomous learning
but also helps teachers in the formative assessment to
givestudentsascientificandareasonableperformance
result.

AFTER TEN YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE CURRICULUM REQUIREMENTS,
ACHIEVEMENTS AND PROBLEMS
COEXIST AND SOME EDUCATIONAL
IDEAS STILL NEED ADJUSTING
3.1
Ideas of education need to keep pace with the
times
Not only the school teaching management, but also
the teachers and the students in a classroom all need to
reject of the stale, narrow-minded beliefs and establish
the scientific concepts of teaching and learning, that is
“respect for talent, respect for individuality, and give
full scope to the talents”.
3.1.1
School administrators
As a school administrator, one should be full of
confidence to cultivate talents, to understand his/her
students, and to work out the training plan for their
development. Jiang Zemin emphasized on the impor-
tance of training talents, saying, “the competition of
today’s world and the future, fundamentally speak-
ing, is the competition of talents. [5]” Recent years
have witnessed a downfall in students’ overall quality
due to an expansion in enrolment, thus some schools
become pessimistic in cultivating talents, and lack
confidence in their own students. They show neglect
in the teaching management and neither go to discover
the problem, nor try to solve it. Also, in some schools,
the phenomenon that one student gains more favours
than another for no reason, greatly undermines the
teaching quality, thus fairness or equality is hard to
maintain.
3.1.2
Teachers, directors of class teaching
As directors of class teaching, teachers should be good
at discovering different personalities of students, and
design respective teaching plans according to their
achievements, personalization and their interest in
English, avoiding “drawing water with a bamboo bas-
ket in vain” and “cannot see the wood from the trees”,
the two typical defects in modern education [6]. In fact,
foreign language teachers at university English teach-
ing have greater say in determining the success of the
whole education. As the directors and participants of
teaching, they can grasp the learning dynamics and
mentality of students on time, and their teaching phi-
losophy and methods will directly affect the cultivating
effect.
3.1.3
College students as the training objects
Contemporary college students, the training objects,
have a common problem, impetuousness. On the one
hand, a society or family influence affects them, on
the other hand they lack a purpose for learning. The
key of talent cultivation is to inspire the soul and self-
confidence. University English teaching should instil
in students the philosophy of life, “you are beautiful
just the way you are”, and cultivate their autonomous
learning motivation as well as confidence in learning
English.
159

3.2
To update the teaching material and curriculum
system
Research on cultivation of foreign language talents has
been going on for many years and have made suc-
cess in the teaching reform. However, no matter how
successful the teaching system and curriculum setting
are, they need upgrading according to the market and
social demands. The school should discard those out-
dated and inappropriate teaching materials and reform
considerably based on its own specific circumstances.
Blindly indulged in authoritative textbooks or success-
ful curriculum, and totally forget its own reality, it can
only cultivate students without social demands, or no
use at all with only a name.
3.3
To further implement education reform
Foreign language teaching and research should be
focused on the needs of the country and the per-
sonnel training. The purpose of the study is to find
out and solve the problems, and ultimately to guide
the teaching practice. At present, formalism and seri-
ous plagiarism exist in the foreign language study.
Repeating word for word what others say, scratch-
ing the surface when serious study is needed, lack
of innovation and visionary perspectives, and without
hard-working, only to name a few. University English
teaching reform will be divorced from reality and fall
into the rigid ideas, if the education theories are to be
separated from the teaching practice.
4
CONCLUSION
The curriculum requirements have been issued for
more than ten years and achieved a very high perfor-
mance. It is the guidance and compass of university
English teaching and reform. In the development of
Chinese internationalization and society today, univer-
sities need to revise the requirements, and appreciate
their basic spirit, further promoting the reform of
university English teaching, changing the teaching
concept, and founding on cultivation of outstanding
foreign language talents. Teachers, working on the
frontiers of education, should put the cultivation of
talent as their focus of work, and constantly improve
their sense of responsibility and professional level, and
give their support to the teaching cause in China.

ABSTRACT:
The Problem Based Learning (PBL) teaching method is a teaching method of a problem based
learning. According to the PBL concept, in the teaching of the microcomputer principle and application course,
a teacher designs a problem, encouraging students to ask questions, guiding the students’ autonomous learning,
discussions,andcooperationingroups.Thus,thestudentscanimprovetheirlearningenthusiasmandcoordination

INTRODUCTION
In the information age, with the expanding knowledge
and the rapid development of science and technology,
socialization is more and more complex.This situation
makes students learn more and become more knowl-
edgeable, and many students began to question what to
learn and how to learn it. Without correct guidance in
study,studentstendtoloseinterestandmotivation.The
PBL, a teaching method of problem-based-learning, is
a good type of method in guiding students’ learning.
Recently, we used the PBL teaching method in the
course of Microcomputer Principle and Application
interface technology. The teaching practice revealed
that teaching under the PBL mode in the course of
Microcomputer Principle and Application has more
advantages in order to improve current college stu-
dents’ learning interest, and to cultivate the students’
thinking about control systems and their ability of
applying these to solve actual problem. This method
played a significant role in improving the teaching
quality and its effects.

THE PRINCIPLE OF PBL TEACHING
METHOD AND THE FEASIBILITY TO APPLY
PBL IN THE COURSE OF MICROCOMPUTER
PRINCIPLE AND APPLICATION
Problem Based Learning (PBL) is a problem-oriented
teaching method and a student-cantered education
way based on the real world.[1] In the late 1960s,
Barrows, an American neurology professor pioneered
this method at McMaster University in Canada. It
was mostly used in medical education, but now it has
become a popular teaching method around the world.
The PBL teaching mode emphasizes that the
study is put in the complex and meaningful problem
situation, and the problem is the starting point for a
study. In the PBL mode, students are encouraged to
ask questions which have no fixed solutions. After the
students’autonomous learning, group discussions and
mutualcooperation,studentscananalyseproblems,set
up hypotheses, simulate and do experiments, and solve
problems. Finally, they can learn the scientific knowl-
edgebehindaproblem.Thisprocesscanmakestudents
realize that they have already known what they need
to learn and try their best to solve a problem; they
discover and use all kinds of information resources
through a variety of ways in trying to solve practi-
cal problems. Meanwhile they can take the initiative
to obtain opportunities in which to apply knowledge,
which can stimulate the students’learning interest and
enthusiasm, cultivate students’ ability to master and
apply knowledge.
Microcomputer Principle andApplication course is
a professional basic course in many colleges and uni-
versities currently, which occupies an important posi-
tion in the specialty construction and course system.[2]
Microcomputer interface technology is a hardware and
a software application technology accompanied by the
overlapping and mutual basis, which is the important
technical foundation for students to learn subsequent
courses, do graduation design and future work. The
course content is made up of the theory and practice,
which can be tedious, boring and abstract. The course
has a high basic, advanced, cutting-edge, and com-
prehensive requirements. It also requires that students
have strong practical abilities. In traditional teacher-
cantered teaching mode, students are not clear about
the course objectives. Therefore, they think that it has
no practical use for their future study and employment.
161

At the same time, the teachers are usually feeling
useless about this. So the learning of this course is
based on the dilemma that ‘students find learning hard,
while teachers find teaching difficult’. The traditional
teaching process ignored the students’ cognitive main
role, which gives a priority to teaching, and it is diffi-
culttostimulatestudents’learningenthusiasmbecause
of the lack of interaction. How to achieve the teaching
goal of the Microcomputer Principle and Applica-
tion course with abstract and complex content, broad
knowledge and strong practicality in limited teaching
time? The PBL teaching mode is especially suitable
for the teaching of the course.
3
PBL MODE OF MICROCOMPUTER
PRINCIPLE AND APPLICATION COURSE
The PBL teaching mode and the characteristics of the
courses of Microcomputer Principle and Application
put forward a new challenge to teachers. It not only
requires teachers to have deep understanding of the
concept of PBL and master skills, but also requires
teachers to have a high level of professional knowledge
and skills. Thus, teachers can blend the PBL teaching
mode in the microcomputer principle and application
class gradually and effectively. For the PBL concept,
teachers present some project problems to students
through typical instances of microcomputer interface
technology, and guide students to find solutions in
the process of finishing the project of microcomputer
interface technology. Students study by themselves
and cooperate with each other, as well as simulate and
do experiments, in order to have a further consolida-
tion of the knowledge about microcomputer principle
and application, to master the implementation steps,
to know each job specification and the matters of
every step , to lay a solid foundation for the study
of subsequent course and the graduation design, etc.
3.1
Design of a problem
According to the teaching target which is set, the prob-
lem should be complex, open, real and explorative;[3]
both students’ knowledge and skills should be consid-
ered, having a moderate difficulty and conforming to
the general requirements of the syllabus.
3.2
Organizing learning team
Allow students are free to form several study teams,
each team of six to eight people. They can solve the
problem through mutual consultation and cooperation
among team members.
3.3
Guiding the team to determine the learning
goals
A teacher should guide every team to have an ele-
mentary discussion, which should include relevant
factual information, a concept, knowledge hidden in
questions, the groups’ initial ideas for solving prob-
lems, etc. The purpose of the discussion is to promote
each team to establish overall learning objectives
and learning programs by team members’ mutual
agreement, simultaneously establishing learning goals
and learning programs for each team member.[4]
3.4
Independent learning
In the guidance of learning goals, each member sep-
arately explores and tries to solve the problem. At
this stage, the teacher first must provide relevant ref-
erences and materials, including the Internet and the
laboratory.According to these resources, students will
actively try to get information, start to make hard-
ware solutions, choose the corresponding electronic
components, and formulate the corresponding circuit
principle diagram.
3.5
Reporting and counselling
After each team self-exploration, teachers should orga-
nize team members to report the progress of each team,
theexistingproblems,andthesolutiontotheproblems.
Then, teachers give answers to students’ questions,
helping students have a better understanding of rel-
evant knowledge, giving the necessary inspiration
and guidance for possible solutions to the existing
problems. According to the teachers’ opinions on
the solution, each team should make the appropri-
ate adjustments, modifications and refinements at the
same time.
3.6
Simulation and experiment
Students should verify the feasibility of the program
through debugging the hardware system and software
system by Proteus. Meanwhile, if we have enough
good condition,we can organize the students in the
lab to do it, or organize the student to weld the PCB,
debug the system, and test the feasibility, which also
can improve the practical ability of students.
3.7
Discussion and summary
Each team displays and shares their collected infor-
mation and solution, then teachers and all teams
analyse and evaluate each team’s ability from the col-
lected information, solutions, process requirements,
advanced technology and coordinated cooperation
among team members in solving the problems. All
teams discuss together and exchange views, sum up
the harvest and experience in the learning process, and
think over the problems that appear in the process of
solving problem.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
PROGRAM OF PBL
Recently, when we taught a microcomputer Inter-
face technique of the Microcomputer Principle and
Application course, students had been in the state
of being tired. In order to mobilize their learning
enthusiasm, we implemented the PBL teaching mode.
Thus, according to the actual situation of the students,
162

we gave them questions as follows: Design a square
wave generator within the scope of the knowledge
using 8086/8088 as microprocessors (To reduce the
difficulty,theoutputfrequencyofthesquarewavegen-
erator is unspecified).The course knowledge related to
this issue including the Hardware system and Software
Systems are as follows.
4.1
Knowledge of the hardware system
The Knowledge of hardware system are as follows:
(1) 8086/8088: Selection of the maximum and mini-
mum operating mode, function of the pins, a phys-
ical address, a logical address, offset addresses,
memory, and the interruption technology.
(2) 8255A: Working Principle, the distribution of port
addresses, the content of work control word, C port
reset / set control word.
(3) 8253: Working principle, the distribution of port
addresses, selection of the working modes (six
operating modes), the content of work control
word; the Equation ² about the initial count value
is below:
where fclk = frequency of the input clock pulse
signal, fout = frequency of the output signal.
(4) Integrated operational amplifier: Non-inverting
input, inverting input, virtual short, virtual off,
negative feedback.
(5) DAC0832:
Conversion
principle,
conversion
accuracy, the choices of work modes (single
buffering, double buffering, direct access). The
Equation II between analog voltage output and the
corresponding digit is below:
where U1 = the upper limit of the voltage,
U2 = the lower limit of the voltage, Ux = the
output voltage.
(6) Oscilloscope.
4.2
Knowledge of software systems
The Knowledge of software systems are as follows:
Instruction (including prescriptive statements and
indicative statements), the format of assembler, pro-
grammingmethodsofassemblylanguage,8255A’sini-
tialprogramming;8253’sinitialprogramming,Proteus
simulation software, emu8086 assembler software.
4.3
Implementation
Thenthestudentsweredividedintoseveralteams,each
team of six to eight people. After guiding the teams
to establish learning goals and learning programs, we
allowed each team member to study independently. A
week later, we organized the teams to report what they
had done, then counselled and answered their existing
problems, and guided them to make the appropriate
changes and adjustments on solutions to the problems.
After another week, we checked and accepted their
achievements.
From the feedback, we found that the students
developed two solutions: (1) Using 8086/8088 and
8253, and the working model 3 of 8253 and giv-
ing it an initial set value, and outputting a certain
frequency square wave from the output terminal of
8253. Some students used the two timers / counters of
8253. One of the square wave output of the counter
is another counter’s clock pulse signal, which is used
in order to improve the role of frequency division.
(2) Using 8086/8088, integrated operational amplifier
and DAC0832. Some students added 8255A between
8086/8088 and DAC0832. An analog current signal
out of DAC0832 is converted into a voltage signal by
integrated operational amplifier. According to the dif-
ferent settings of digital quantity, its output voltage is
correspondingly high or low. The same delay subrou-
tine is called to meet the requirements of the square
wave. The output voltage signal is unipolar or bipolar
square wave from a virtual oscilloscope on Proteus, a
simulation software.
When talking about the learning feelings and expe-
riences, the students all agreed that the PBL teaching
mode improved everyone’s interest and motivation
in learning, helped further understanding on com-
puter architecture, assembly language and interface
technology, and had more direct perceptions of con-
trol principles of microprocessor and the workflow
of some chips, and had preliminary understanding in
comprehensive application of hardware and software
systems. We all believed that the PBL teaching mode
played an important role in cultivating the ability of
solving problems, cooperation and coordination, and
the training of overall quality.
4.4
Existing questions
However, there are some problems in the specific
implementation of the PBL teaching method, as
follows:
(1) Some students showed a perfunctory attitude to
the task because of the lack of self-study time and
discussion time.
(2) Student’s ability in communication and coop-
eration is obviously inadequate. Some students
cannot adapt to the changes in teaching methods,
and some even had resentments. The quality of
teaching was affected.
(3) The PBL teaching method emphasizes that stu-
dents play the main role in learning. For the
students with poor self-discipline, it is hard to
learn things.
(4) The PBL teaching method makes higher demands
for teachers, who need to be mentally prepared,
as well as possessing the necessary skills. In addi-
tion to this, inadequate preparation can affect their
teaching effectiveness.
163

(5) The PBL teaching method requires that teachers’
guiding behaviour must be “timely”, “moderate”,
and a “proper law”, or it will also affect the
teaching effectiveness.
(6) The PBL teaching method requires improved
teaching conditions. Lack of learning resources in
the library, computer network resources, teaching
software, and lack of a hardware laboratory will
have a direct impact on students’learning attitudes
and learning results.

Research into the teaching reform of the C# course based
on One Case in the End
Xiaojing Wang
School of Information Science and Technology, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, China
ABSTRACT:
In view of the lack of coherence and integrity caused by the phenomenon of poor teaching results
in the Object Oriented Programming C# course teaching, it is proposed to use the methods of the One Case in the
End in the process of teaching C#. An analysis of the teaching process and teaching effect evaluation methods
needs to be made as well as the key problems that need attention, and the process of teaching. Finally, carrying
out the practical applications has obtained good teaching results.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
Introduction of One Case in the End
Constructivist learning theory holds that students
obtain knowledge is by way of construction of mean-
ing, in certain situations, with the help of others, using
the necessary learning materials. That is to say, the
learner to acquire knowledge quantity does not depend
on his memory or reciting ability, but the ability of
decision by itself according to the experience con-
struction the relevant knowledge of the significance
[1]. The teaching method of “One Case in the End” is
based on this theory arising.
One Case in the End, also called One Pass, refers to
at the beginning of a course, the teacher chooses a typ-
ical case or materials, and combination all knowledge
points of course to the case throughout., help the stu-
dents construct their own knowledge system and gain
new knowledge in the learning process, improve the
multi ability and scientific literacy [2]. Here’s Case,
can be either one example or one material can also be
a person, a thing, a topic.
1.2
Introduction of C# course
“Object Oriented Programming C#” is the result of the
work of a Microsoft Corporation researcher Anders
Hejlsberg , it is an object oriented language, and it
derived from C and C++ programming languages,
has the characteristics of security and stability, is sim-
ple and elegant, and almost all of the research latest
achievements of software development and software
engineering: object-oriented, type safe, component
technology, automatic memory management, cross
platform exception handling code, version control,
code security management and so on. According to
the TIOBE ranking in September 2014, data show that
C# ranked fifth in nearly 100 types of programming
languages, the market prospects are very optimistic.
Conforming to the trends of technology develop-
ment and career needs, C# language has become an
important branch of programming languages at col-
leges and universities. As a program design course,
case teaching method is the most important teaching
method. However, the coherence and integrity of the
case is often ignored by teachers, only using a large
number of cases, the teaching effect is not good. At
the end of the course, students cannot macro grasp
the course content. A lots of students almost cannot
develop a project by using curriculum knowledge, that
is to say that it cannot arrive at the teaching target.
The “One Case in the End” teaching method is
applied in some humanities teaching, and has obtained
the ideal teaching effect. R shows that One Case in the
End teaching thought of using the invariant situations
to focus the attention of students, the contact of all
knowledge can help student to bulid a good knowl-
edge construct, which avoid students cannot do what
to do. Moreover, students to construct the intrinsic
link between the old and new knowledge of the use
of comparative, reasoning, inductive method, and put
the old knowledge to new knowledge, to achieve posi-
tive transfer of knowledge [3]. However, there are few
applications used to implement One Case in the End
teaching method in science and engineering courses.
The author found that the results of the above study
are also suitable for programming courses.With object
oriented programming C# as an example, the objective
of the course is solving practical problems through
programming, this process is usually integrated appli-
cation of course content. Thus, organizing teaching
with the one case method fits the teaching goal of the
course.

APPLICATION PROCESS OF THE ONE CASE
IN THE END IN THE C# COURSE TEACHING
2.1
Case selection
The core problem of the One Case in the End is
the selection of cases. When selecting cases, teach-
ers should grasp the principle of interesting, practical,
comprehensive, applicability [4]. Among them, the
interest can captivate students’ attention, and enhance
the atmosphere of the classroom. The practicality is
determined by the characteristics of the C# curricu-
lum, the curriculum itself is used to solve the practical
problems of production and management, so a course
case also be practical. Comprehensive is to enable stu-
dents to complete course knowledge construct through
one case. Applicability is to choose a suitable case for
students to accept, should not be too difficult and too
complex, and can use some simple practical projects.
In the process of teaching in the past, the author
used a chat robot case, and found that students are
very fond of this case situation. The “robot” is a sci-
ence and technology project of popular; The “robot”
case is a universal case which can stimulate enthu-
siasm and increase interest in learning. At the same
time, this case combined with embedded technology
can achieve real robot versatility,whichispracticaland
comprehensive. Of course, teachers can choose other
cases , for example, students learning life is closely
related topics, that the Grant Management Information
System, or the Dormitory Management Information
System and so on.
2.2
Design of teaching process
The teaching process is divided into several cycles
according to time. Each cycle consists of three phases
which are: before class, in class, and after class. Each
cycle’s end to end are linked together, to form a
complete teaching process. The task of teachers and
students in each cycle is shown in Table 1. The whole
teaching process is shown in Figure 1. The BC, IC
and AC respectively represent the time before class, in
class and after class.

that integrate knowledge points closely, with different
forms of virtual robots, different functions, and differ-
ent personalities. And the case has become an organic
whole, at the end of the course, the virtual robots are
manufactured successfully.

robot object, initializes a robot parameters (build baby
robot), defines a robot methods (functions), and cre-
ates a robot future generations, build a robot family,
defines robot interface , design and implement a robot
database and so on.
Throughout the Object Oriented Programming C#
course teaching process, teachers uses different forms
of virtual robots as one case.Almost all the knowledge
points are explained using one case. Students happy
learning, and gets a systematic learning experience,
At the same time so that students interested in robotics
technology products, students explore the spirit of
innovation ability and scientific attitude, inspire stu-
dents’ curiosity and creativity, enhance analyse and
solve practical problems.(3) After class, students
digest cases using the following forms, such as exper-

be consolidated. Allow students to use their imagina-
tion to realize such robots play Rubik’s cube, and robot
play go bang, and so on.The students digest knowledge
in interesting games. The students apply old knowl-
edge to new knowledge consciously to achieve positive
transfer of knowledge in a coherent situation.After the
end of the course, all programs that students learned
about the robots are assembled by students to complete
a sizable virtual robot which has many functions, and
then students consolidate the gains by showing and
explaining the demonstration program, or join in con-
tests. Thus, the project was born, and at the same time,
students can easily construct a C# knowledge system.
The correlation between teaching content and robot

two examples, we can see that one case in the context

focus on absorbing new knowledge.

2.3
Teaching effect examination system
C# course is both a theoretical and a practical course,
evaluation of teaching effectiveness in two ways: writ-
ten examination and software works. The purpose of
the written examination is that students master the
basic concepts, the basic theory, and the basic skills.
The purpose of the software works assessment is that
testing students’ practical ability and ability to solve
problems. Both are indispensable.
As a routine examination form, written within the
stipulated time, the student independent, without the
aid of any help to complete the course under exami-
nation. If they do not understand completely course
theory, is more difficult to pass the examination.
Of course, teachers should grasp the difficulty of
examination papers. By analysing examination papers,
teachers can find shortcomings and deficiencies in
teaching, thus the teaching can be improved.
The software works reflect the students’ design
capabilities, programming capabilities, and even pro-
fessional capacity, and is directly reflected on the C#
course teaching objectives. Teachers should provide
some spare topics for students to choose from, usu-
ally works done by another student. Works need to
be completed over a longer period of time, usually
outside the classroom. To test the quality of the work,
students must pass a brief reply process to ensure
the authenticity of the work.Finally, teachers give stu-
dents a comprehensive assessment of the result, the
result should be a comprehensive written exam, work
achievements, classroom performance, and experi-
mental achievements. Teachers should summarize of
teaching methods of “One Case in the End” in practice
improve themselves.
3
THE KEY PROBLEMS THAT NEED
ATTENTION
3.1
Moderate degree of difficulty of teaching cases
If the case is too easy, they will put the simple question
to complicate when in use advanced techniques (such
as threads, commission, events). Too complex a case
will make the students lose confidence. Therefore, the
process of this case should be brief, and used to cover
all knowledge points.
3.2
Compare One Case in the End with one theory
and more cases
This method of One Case in the End is superior, but
there are also disadvantages, that will cause illusion
to students: C# can only solve this problem of the
case.The reason is that always limited in one example.
Therefore, teachers must make up for this deficiency
by increase examples. Especially for beginners, it is
necessary for a knowledge point to use multiple small
typical examples to explain. In addition, when they are
in a single situation for a long time, students appeared
fatigue, and thus lose interest. Therefore, it is advan-
tageous to add a small example. Teachers should have
strong technical reserves.
This method of One Case in the end demands that
teachers have the ability of finding, analysing and
solving teaching problems in a short time when all
program segments are transferred into one project, and
each knowledge are linked intrinsically to curriculum
teaching case, each program must have relevance.
4
CONCLUSION
The author has used the teaching method of the One
Case in the End in the Object-Oriented Programming
C# curriculum teaching for the last three years, and
it had an ideal teaching results. This method solves
the continuity, integrity and systemic problems of cur-
riculum cases, while training students in the feel of the
project, enhancing their interests in learning, and ulti-
mately enabling students to easily make sense of the
construct C# knowledge system, multi-angle, depth
and systematically mining the course content, and
strengthening their professional skills.

From the survey by the employers, medical spe-
cialty settings and the curriculum needs are adapt to
socio-economic needs in Zhejiang.The research group
received the same conclusion in the survey on the
graduates, that most graduates believe the specialty
curriculum fits social needs, and 90.54% graduates
have learned them by working with their professional
counterparts.

(13.64%).
2.4
Reform of personnel training
In terms of medical talents training and teaching
reform, the survey found that there are three sugges-
tions significantly higher than other proposals. They
are strengthening the teaching internship trainee and
social practice areas, strengthening the cultivation
of application ability (25.53%); developing interper-
sonal communication skills and coordination capacity
(23.40%); strengthening the research and innovation
capacity-building (17.02%).

DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
From the survey of employers and graduates in Zhe-
jiang, medical graduates have the solid foundation
of the theory and professional knowledge and high
professionalism, etc. But in terms of research and
innovation capacity, relationships, practices and orga-
nizational management, medical graduates are not
recognized. Based on the above issues, the research
group put forward the following recommendations.
3.1
Improving the practical teaching system,
reforming teaching mode
Because medicine is a very practical subject, med-
ical colleges should focus on strengthening students’
hands-on approach and practical ability.Teaching pro-
grams should fully reflect a practical teaching system.
Curriculum development should increase the pro-
portion of practice teaching. On clinical teaching,
most medical colleges have currently adopted bed-
side teaching. Medical colleges should establish the
university clinical skills centre (or simulated hospi-
tal), unified management, should reform assessment
methods, and increase practice assessment efforts.
3.2
Constructing the system of extracurricular
scientific and technological activities
Medical colleges should develop the system of
extracurricular scientific and technological activities,
set up scientific research training courses and special
academic lectures, hold academic forums, academic
festivals, academic essay competitions, organize stu-
dents to seminars and other academic activities of
research projects, and open laboratories which are
equipped with professional instructors. Awards and
publicity has made outstanding achievements of stu-
dents and instructors in technological innovations.
3.3
Strengthening the teaching staff
The quality of teachers determines the quality of
students. In the investigation forum of graduates,
the research group repeatedly learned that students
expressed praise and gratitude to good, serious,
and responsible teachers. Medical colleges should
strengthen the teaching staff planning, creating a num-
ber of teachers with advanced educational philosophy,
a high level of professionalism, and a strong sense
of responsibility; they should plan and systematically
train a number of teachers who are adapted to medical
education and research.
3.4
Well-organizing student activities
Students’comprehensive ability depends both on their
own quest for knowledge, but also on the atmosphere
and can affect the learning environment. Medical
colleges should give full play to the role of the sec-
ond, third class, well-organized and colourful, healthy
and progressive student activities, in the creation of
“patient communication” course, based on the intro-
duction of “medical humanities”, “interpersonal” and
other elective courses or seminars.
3.5
Helping students develop a scientific college
planning
From the results of this survey, many graduates
reflected on the lack of learning goals at college; they
did not know what to learn and how to learn it dur-
ing their time at medical school. Schools should help
students under their guidance to develop overall goals
172

as well as targeted, detailed, specific, and individu-
alized milestones. Universities should offer ‘College
study guides’, electives, and lectures, advertised on the
website.

Educational quality improvement in the ‘Principles of Communications’
course, based on bilingual teaching and research teaching mode
Lei Yu, Li Zhou, Jiali Luo & Yuhan Zhou
Department of Electronic Information Engineering, Nanchang Hangkong University, Jiangxi Province, China
ABSTRACT:
A research teaching mode centred on problem solving and the combination of teaching and
research is presented based on the characteristics of the course Principles of Communications and bilingual
teaching. A complete research teaching system is established through revision of the syllabus, development
of the interactive platform and design for the practice session. The results of the practice show that not only
are the students’ academic grades improved, but their enthusiasm for the course are also stimulated, and their
research capabilities are enhanced as well.Thus, a solid foundation has been laid for the cultivation of innovative
inter-disciplinary talents who will meet the needs of the information technology development.

INTRODUCTION1
Principles of Communications is an essential spe-
cialized basic course regarded as a vital connection
between the previous basic courses and the subse-
quent specialized courses. With the development of
science and technology, and the deepening of inter-
national communication, more and more communi-
cation engineering professionals are required to be
equipped with abundant foreign language skills in
our country in the information age. In 2002, Pro-
fessor Zhou Li at Nanchang Hangkong University
took the lead in introducing the original teaching
material from the University of New South Wales in
the curriculum construction of the bilingual course –
Principles of Communications[1]. Soon afterwards,
Southeast University[2], Jiangxi University of Sci-
ence and Technology[3], and Nanjing University of
Posts and Telecommunications[4] successively began
to open similar bilingual courses.
Dominated by the traditional teaching ideas, most
universities merely focus on the inculcation of theo-
retical knowledge instead of strengthening students’
research capabilities during the teaching process of
Principles of Communications[5]. Research teaching,
on the other hand, pays more attention to improving
students’ scientific literacy when imparting knowl-
edge. Rich in content and involving all aspects in

communication process of signal, channel, modula-
tion, demodulation, and synchronization, Principles
of Communications provides vast development space
for research-based courses[6]. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to implement the course reform and the research
teaching method.

RESEARCH METHOD
Firstly, on the basis of the characteristics of bilin-
gual teaching and Principles of Communications, we
revisethesyllabusavailableforresearchteaching.Sec-
ondly, an interactive platform is developed to support
it. Finally, during the teaching process, a design for
teaching and practice is conducted based on a problem-
solving design. In addition, website and demonstra-
tion software are further applied to assist it in order to
achieve better research results.
Research method is illustrated in Figure 1.

Obviously, it is almost impossible for teachers to drive
home the concepts, or explain the problems in such a
short time. Thus, this makes it difficult for students to
have a thorough understanding of their professionals.
Hence, we can see that the curriculum is both time
consuming and fruitless. Bilingual teaching in engi-
neering courses, on the other hand, not only improves
teaching efficiency, but also makes it possible for stu-
dents to learn more systematically and deepen their
understanding. In addition, bilingual teaching stimu-
lates students’ initiative, so that they are more likely
to acquire as much knowledge as they can in a short
time, and they are also trained in independent read-
ing and self-teaching skills. The original edition of
Principles of Communications, which is informative,
new in content and practicality, is not only beneficial
to the improvement of students’ English proficiency,
but also guides students to use English dictionaries
which enable them to increase their reading quantity
in English documents, enrich their knowledge, and
provide a thorough grounding in quick obtainment of
first-hand information on advanced technology in the
related field.

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RESEARCH
TEACHING MODE BASED ON
BILINGUAL TEACHING
Traditional expository teaching method is gener-
ally adopted in Principles of Communications. Most
teachers only focus on the inculcation of theoreti-
cal knowledge during the teaching process. Although
it maximizes the amount of knowledge transmis-
sion, students’ lack of active thinking and questioning
opportunities makes the knowledge unrenewable after
being transmitted by the teacher. This is the teach-
ing method that puts students in a passive position.
It is contrary to the original purpose of teaching, and
students’ scientific literacy development is therefore
neglected.

Principles of Communications is an important pro-
fessional course served as a link between some related
professional courses. On the one hand, knowledge
acquired in the previous basic courses such as Signal
and System and High Frequency Circuit, is essen-
tial for learning Principles of Communications. On
the other hand, knowledge learned in Principles of
Communications is also indispensable for the sub-
sequent courses such as Mobile Communication and
Fiber Communication. Rich in content and involving
all aspects of the communication process, it provides
a vast development space for research-based courses.
Therefore, due to the introduction of research teaching
mode in Principles of Communications, the traditional
teaching method will be changed and students will
have greater opportunities not only to develop their
innovative spirit and practical abilities, but also to
improve their scientific literacy and attitude, which
may lead to the improvement of their capabilities to
analyse and solve practical problems by using their
knowledge.
The research teaching mode of Principles of Com-
municationsisestablishedbasedonbilingualteaching,
aiming to improve teachers’ teaching method and
develop students’ abilities. Case teaching and heuris-
tic teaching methods are adopted in the classrooms
to stimulate students’ enthusiasm for the course. We
also design an English course website based on Zend
Framework and develop the practical teaching demon-
stration software to enhance students’ professional
skills and research capabilities.

EDUCATIONAL RESULTS
We succeeded in teaching the method by means of
teaching and developing the capabilities of problem
solving when the research teaching mode was estab-
lished and carried out on the basis of the policy: ‘To
combine teaching with scientific research, to promote
research with teaching and to enrich teaching content
with research results’.
The research teaching mode reform of Principles
of Communications (bilingual) has taken place in six
classes at our faculty from 2009 to 2011. After col-
lecting and analysing the information of Principles of
Communication’ for ten years, we can find that:
1. Students’ English level is greatly improved by
bilingual teaching. (The number of students that
passed CET-6 has greatly increased. See Table 1)

CONCLUSION
We have explored a research teaching mode suitable
for bilingual teaching through research and practice.
Our teaching purpose is achieved through the follow-
ing methods: 1. Revising the syllabus and multimedia
works for research-based Principles and Communica-
tions (bilingual). 2. Setting experiments for research-
based Principles and Communications (bilingual) and
compiling the related experiment instruction books.
3. Developing the practical teaching software and
English course website. Hence, not only do we stim-
ulate students’ enthusiasm for learning and enhance
their research capabilities, but also lay a solid foun-
dation for cultivation of innovative inter-disciplinary
talents who will meet the needs of the information
technology development.

ABSTRACT:
This paper studies the application of the virtual experiment in the power electronic technology
course theory teaching, on the basis of analysis of the course teaching content, curriculum reform direction
about the power electronic technology and the background of the electrical engineering requirements. The paper
uses different means of virtual simulation experiment, creating favourable conditions for the smooth running of
the course teaching and meeting the needs of the students’ individualized learning through the optimization of
the teaching content. After teaching practice of many years, the practice that leads the power electronics course
teaching reform by virtual experiment teaching has made a significant impact on training students to analyse
and solve problems, to develop practical and innovation ability. This teaching practice also promotes knowledge,
and the ability and quality of the students’ coordinated development.

INTRODUCTION
Electrical engineering has strong engineering proper-
ties.The professional demand of society in general can
be divided into three categories-research (including
application research), application, and professional
skills (also known as professional skills), accord-
ing to the development of science and technology in
the electrical engineering field in China. The train-
ing demand of electrical engineering undergraduate
talents should mainly belong to application, accord-
ing to the nature functions of professional technical
university. Therefore, the basic theory and the train-
ing of practical and comprehensive ability should be
paid attention to, especially the training of applica-
tion ability. So it is important that status of theoretical
analysis in the major and leads to mathematical tools
applied in the study of electrical engineering are much
more. Meanwhile, as the main and basic means, the
experiment research is very important in engineering
major. Without the basic test conditions, it is diffi-
cult for the students to grasp the basic knowledge of
this major. So simulation has become a kind of widely
used method for the specialty with the development of
computer technology. Based on above analysis, exper-
imental research, simulation, equivalent and analogy
are important scientific methods for the specialty.
Power electronic technology is an interdisciplinary
technology that powers electronic devices that are used
for power transformation and control. It is the inte-
grated interdisciplinary of many subjects that include
power transformation technology, modern electronic
technology, power semiconductor devices, and auto-
matic control technology. Then the all are applied
in the field of power electronics technology. Since
the electric circuit structure and the waveform draw-
ings of the teaching are more and complicated, so
it is difficult for the students to study. For the cur-
riculum teaching process, there are a large number
of waveform analyses in the theory teaching con-
tent. Traditional approach applies to a large number
of charts and draws voltage and current waveform fig-
ure of converter process. The analysis shows that the
process lacks the authenticity and the teaching effi-
ciency is low. If the students can observe the voltage
and current waveform after rectifier from the oscil-
loscope by combining the experiment demonstration,
it will play a good role in promoting on the students’
in-depth understanding to the teaching content. But as
a result of the teaching content update quickly, the lab-
oratory construction fund shortage and other objective
conditions, the teachers cannot be in the class presen-
tation one by one and it is impossible to allow the
students to verify all circuit by experiment one by one.
Thus it cannot be completely synchronized in prac-
tical teaching for power electronics teaching content.
How to strengthen the effect of experiment teaching,
practical teaching and teaching mode that combines
innovation theory and practice, and how to meet the
demand of the current theoretical teaching, how to
maximize the realization of the professional train-
ing target-engineering and technology talents, they
are the targets that are worthy of continuous efforts
in the teaching reform.

Course content system block diagram of power electronic technology.
With the rapid development of virtual computer
technology, building virtual experiments with the use
of electronic technology simulation software and a
computer has greatly improved the level of power elec-
tronics practice teaching course. Virtual experiment is
a new experimental method that constructs an exper-
imental simulation environment using a computer
and achieves the effect and purpose of experiment
through the establishment of circuit, and the analy-
sis of data and the circuit function. There are many
types of specific application software, for example
Multisim is one of the common tools for electronic
technology design and training, which can be used to
test and analyse control circuits of power electronics.
MATLAB/SIMULINK is mostly used to rapidly finish
the simulation and calculation of the power electronic
circuit topology structure. In particular, the power sys-
tem toolkit modules after the version of MATLAB5.2,
provide the ideal tool for the research and simulation of
power electronic technology; it makes the experiment
circuit that originally must be jointed with real power
device to finish by ‘soft experiment’ with simulation
research on the computer. Since virtual experiment
does not almost need any investment, it also does not
have the risk of burning components and endangering
the personal safety in reality, it is an ideal means to
strengthen the practical teaching effect.
This paper explores the virtual simulation software
using that MATLAB is its main tool. It constructs
a virtual experiment, which is useful in the class-
room teaching, in order to realize the specific idea and
method with the combination of theory and practice,
and then it can raise the theory teaching effect of the
power electronics course.

DIRECTION OF COURSE REFORM
AND DEVELOPMENT
2.1
Course content characteristics analysis
As the basis of electrical engineering, especially
in the comprehensive engineering technology, the
application of power electronic technology course
is main target. So the teaching content is divided
into three parts: power electronics devices, power
electronics converter circuit, and the control tech-
nology of power electronic circuit. According to the
subject development and the needs to meet the mil-
itary training transformation, we update and adjust
course content and build a new type of power elec-
tronics course content system, which is shown in
Figure 1.
Power electronic technology is based on power elec-
tronic devices, power electronic devices control is a
means of implementation, and various circuit topol-
ogy structures are the specific application. This kind
of structure determines that the course has the follow-
ing features: (1) Discipline overlapping, wide range
and good practicality; (2) Quick development and
advanced content. It is hard to meet the requirements
of teaching for the traditional experimental method
and it is necessary to pay attention to the innovation of
practice teaching content synchronization; (3) Strong
applicability. Course content does not only combine
closely with the daily life, but with the new power
equipment especially, it is more widely used in the new
weapons system. This requires certain comprehensive
design ability and analytical ability of the students,
so that they master the comprehensive utilization abil-
ity of the new weapon system power equipment, and
improve the capacity of the first position.
2.2
Course teaching reform target
These characteristics of the course determine that
the teaching reform should be aimed at making the
students understand the technical movements of the
power electronic technology development, the new
application field, and the application in weapon system
power through the course of learning. In accordance
with the requirements of the curriculum reform teach-
ing goal, it must be emphasized that equal attention
must be paid to the theory and practice; the princi-
ple of theory, as the service of application in theory
teaching, and the comprehensive application of power
180

electronic technology in weapon equipment should be
strengthened appropriately. This method requires that
the students must be good at outward learning on the
basis of the basic circuit, but is difficult to bear expand-
ing demands of the practice which rely only on the
fundamental experiment method. At the same time,
the power electronic technology is developing rapidly,
all kinds of new types of power electronic devices, the
circuit topology and control technology appear con-
stantly, and power electronic technology applications
are increasingly becoming widespread. This poses a
challenge for the course practice teaching of the power
electronic technology. Therefore the study on virtual
experiment teaching is of great significance in culti-
vating innovative talents for electrical engineering in
the power electronic technology course.

THE ANALYSIS OF APPLICATION OF
VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGY IN POWER
ELECTRONICS TEACHING REFORM
3.1
Physical and virtual combination to enhance
the cognitive level of the senses
In the knowledge system of the power electronic tech-
nology course, the component part is the foundation
and the premise of other contents. The main teaching
involves structures of various types of devices, work
principles, characteristic parameters, using method
and the drive and protection etc.The purpose of teach-
ing is to lead students to master the use method of all
kinds of power electronic devices proficiently and the
problems that should be paid attention in use. For the
primary sensory of devices, the teaching method in a
real way can be used. However, to really improve their
abilities to use the devices, there will be very large lim-
itations and low efficiency if using visual illustrations
in theory lessons. Properly combine with the simu-
lation test and make every module necessary for the
master electrical components add to the SIMULINK
model editor window, you can quickly set up simu-
lation model to realize the calculation simulation of
power electronics devices, to master the deep cogni-
tion, such as device working principle, performance
parametersandsoonandtoimprovethestudents’basic
use skills to the components. Certainly, the disadvan-
tage of the simulation software is that the elements
in circuit are all symbols and very different from the
physical test. We can increase immersion of the vir-
tual experiment software into the multimedia auxiliary
teaching software on the basis of the existing, realize
the complementary advantages through the design of
multimedia electronic technology experiment system
software and enhance intuition and operability of the
virtual experiment.
The main part of the power electronic technology
course is the five types of circuits which has a basic
transformer circuit, a rectifier circuit, a chopping cir-
cuit, ac power control and ac frequency conversion
circuit, and an inverter circuit. The teaching purposes
Figure 2.

Figure 3.
Simulation waveform when α = 0◦and α = 60◦.
of this part require students to have four types of
ability: drawing, analysis, calculation, and selection.
Drawing means drawing main circuit diagram; analy-
sis means analysing the working principle of the circuit
and drawing out the circuit work waveform combined
with the circuit diagram; calculation means calculat-
ing some important electric parameters, such as the
average of the rectifier circuit output voltage, inverter
circuit outputs voltage harmonic, and withstands volt-
age of the power switching device, etc. Selection
means choosing the appropriate power switch devices
which mostly involves in rated voltage and rated cur-
rent of a power switch device. For four kinds of ability
of the trainees, the organization way that regards the
physical experiment as the forerunner and the virtual
experiment as the subject can be used. To conduct the
virtual experiment, we first need to draw an experi-
ment circuit on the software platform, thus drawing
ability can be promoted. The experiment components
can easily change in the software testing platform,
especially as it can lower the difficulty and inexperi-
enced risk of exploratory experiment; through analysis
of the simulation software and computer waveform
display function, guiding students to analyse the cir-
cuit and select the component intuitively become easy.
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, it is the contrast results
figure that common cathode three-phase half wave
controlled rectifier circuit and operation simulation
in the Simulink environment simulation circuit. It has
181

intuitive demonstration effect for students to master
and use circuit.
Therefore, through the comprehensive combination
of physical and virtual technology the sensory cogni-
tive level of the basic components and circuit structure
can be strengthened and the students’ ability to learn
can be improved overall.
3.2
Guided with the content optimization, actively
cooperated with the virtual experiment
With the new development of power electronic tech-
nology, the course information is being continually
increased. But the formulation of new wide profes-
sional teaching plan, the teaching period be com-
pressed further, but the content become much more.
Therefore, how to effectively impart knowledge for
different majors in the limited time and how to lead the
bold innovation of teaching content, teaching means,
and teaching methods are the necessity of develop-
ing a discipline situation. Tuning the course content to
form a set of rapid change for the transformation of the
physical experiment is of certain difficulty to spend a
lot of manpower and material resources, thus keeping
the continuity through virtual experiment is of great
significance.
Aiming at the optimization of teaching contents, the
half-controlled devices physical experiment content
can be appropriately cut and the full-controlled devices
and power integrated devices of experiment content
can be strengthened in the virtual experiment teach-
ing. Compared to the traditional phase-controlling
technique, new computer control technology and
PWM control in independently virtual experiment
can be properly increased; the chopper technology
and inverter part can be increased in the virtual
demonstration experiment class.
On the basis of the innovation of the teaching means
and methods, we should implement the idea of quality
education and innovative education into the classroom.
The course can adopt the teaching experiment method
of the heuristic type, a contrast type research, etc. The
most basic approach is to give the virtual experiment
a full play in the class, and increase the experimen-
tal efficiency and saturation course. In addition, make
use of virtual simulation technology to enhance the
teaching of images and promote the students’ percep-
tions. Pay attention to summary and contrast through
the experiment teaching, such as in Figure 3, the dif-
ferent output voltage, current waveform and other
knowledge points under the different load parameters
about the full-controlled bridge. The virtual simula-
tion experiments have the advantages of intuitiveness
and accuracy. A certain number of virtual simulation
practices should be done in extracurricular studies to
deepen and consolidate the theoretical knowledge.
3.3
Flexible application of virtual teaching
methods to improve theory teaching effect
In view of different content, a virtual experiment
can be divided into different types. To enhance the
experimental effect, different ways of virtual experi-
ment should be applied flexibly in the power electronic
teaching practice.
The learned knowledge in view of power elec-
tronic components is suitable for a large number of
virtual demonstration experiments. An experiment is
presented to enhance the real sensitivity of the stu-
dents to the knowledge they have learned and inspire
the initiative and enthusiasm of the students’thinking.
The experiment is designed by the teachers carefully, it
can guide the students to observe, analyse, induce, and
summarize the relevant laws according to the experi-
ment phenomenon. Two ways that include video and
animation demonstration can be mostly adopted under
theconditionofthenetwork.Videopresentationmakes
the whole experimental process made by the teachers
filmed completely. It repeats the experiment scene by
storage and transmission of the computer network to
make the students watch the experiments. Animation
showing is made by Flash, Author ware and so on,
especially in science and engineering classes. It can
show the experiment process accurately, simulate the
actual process and phenomenon that the teachers find
hard to describe with language, and highlight the key
points and the difficulties. In the virtual demonstra-
tion experiments, the interactivity provided is limited,
and the experimental condition lacks authenticity, so
attention should be paid to strengthening the teachers’
guidance and the summary.
In the learning process of extensible knowledge of
the power electronics course, in addition to the use
of hardware experiment, a large number of simula-
tion experiments can be made. Simulation experiments
simulate the experimental equipment, such as the
instrument, the facility, the component and so on, and
the experimental conditions with software in a com-
puter, then display them using the text, graphics, or
animation. A virtual laboratory can regard MATLAB
Simulink and management software’ as a platform,
the students in the lab interact with the experiment
software after they login into the virtual laboratory.
They can make full use of the abundant experimen-
tal equipment in the virtual equipment library, design
the experimental process, build experimental devices,
operate experiment, finish statistical analysis of the
experimental results, etc. according to the needs of the
experiment. Finally, they write the experiment report
and the whole experimental process is finished on the
computer. For example, the students are free to use
all kinds of resistors, capacitors, transistors, integrated
circuits, and other virtual devices of the software to
finish the circuit that is required in the lab, and then
connect to a virtual switch and power, as well as the
signal generator, the measuring instruments, the oscil-
loscope, and other virtual instruments to conduct the
experiments and observe and record the experimental
data and results. The simulation experiment operated
by software should pay special attention to standard-
izing the experimental skills of the students and make
them develop good training habits.
Anyhow, we should formulate the corresponding
specification and apply the ways of virtual experiment
182

flexibly according to different teaching contents, so
that the students can summarise the knowledge they
have learned more conveniently and more intuitively,
and improve the ability of analysis and application in
the basic principle of power electronics technology.
3.4
Develop the advantages of virtual experiment
and promote the comprehensive ability
The teaching purpose of this course is to make the
user have certain experiment ability, accurately and
skilfully use the knowledge in order to analyse and
solve relatively simple and practical problems, lay
foundations for the study of theory and principle,
and improve students’ innovation consciousness and
innovation ability at the same time.
A target is regarded as traction, to guide students to
learn from reception of exploration and independent
cooperation through the virtual simulation experi-
ment, to encourage students to think independently,
to stimulate the initiative of learning, and improve
the ability of independent thinking. Accordingly, to
carry out a comprehensive design of the virtual power
electronics experiment and to reconstruct the curricu-
lum in several comprehensive design type teaching
experiment projects, such as an application of the
DC speed regulating device, the intermediate fre-
quency induction heating power supply, and switching
the power supply and inverter. Implementation of the
project bring in responsibility system during the pro-
cess, in the form of project development, the students
can be divided into group and select their own top-
ics. A complete power electronics experiment system
includes power electronic devices, a variable flow cir-
cuit, and a control circuit, which involves the power
electronic system design, installation, debugging, and
other working processes. These tasks can be refined
according to labour, to ensure that each goes smoothly
and exercises the students’ team consciousness and
coordinated ability.
Through the combination of comprehensive vir-
tual experiment design, theoretical teaching, and real
experiment, teaching effect of experiment process is
greatly enriched, the students’ability of understanding
of the theory, practical ability, and scientific research
is improved, the consciousness of cultivating innova-
tion is achieved, and the rigorous scientific attitude
and scientific research methods are cultivated. Also,
the students’ ability to analyse the problems by using
computer tools and solve the actual problem of power
electronic circuits is improved.

CONCLUSIONS
Virtual experiment teaching can cultivate the stu-
dents’ scientific attitude and innovation spirit, arouse
subjective initiatives of the students, make the stu-
dents master the basic theory knowledge, and promote
the students’ cognitive development. Based on virtual
experiment teaching, developing theory teaching of
the power electronics course and using the advanced
virtual simulation technology lead to electrical engi-
neering teaching go smoothly. It is easy to carry
out according to the students’ aptitude and meets the
needs of individualized learning. After several years’
of teaching practice, combining the development trend
with characteristics of power electronics, as well as
weapons and equipment by means of virtual exper-
iment teaching, focusing on the optimization of the
teachingcontents,breakthroughinthereformofteach-
ing methods, and adopting flexible virtual experiment
methods, have had a significant effect on training
students to analyse and solve problems, improving
their practical ability and innovation ability, and pro-
moting the coordinated development of the students’
knowledge, ability, and quality.

School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China
ABSTRACT:
With a higher number of students enrolling at colleges and the slowing down in global economic
growth, the original employment model has been unable to adapt to these changes. This paper begins with the
building of a career guidance system at Harbin Institute of Technology and then discusses the strengthening
construction of the career guidance team, reforming a career guidance curriculum, and building employment
information systems for the purpose of improving the reform of the graduate career guidance mode.

INTRODUCTION
With the continuous expansion scale of computer sci-
ence education, the number of university students
increased dramatically in recent years. However, the
employment rate and the job quality of graduates
whose major is in computer science are not ideal.
According to 2014 Global Employment Trends Report
by the International Labour Organization in January
2014, global economic recovery is very slow, and the
growth in the labour market is slow globally as well.
In 2013, global unemployment reached 202 million
people. In 2014, the growth of the global employ-
ment rate remains weak and unemployment continues
to rise, especially among young people and many
potential workers. The global employment situation
is not so optimistic, while the situation of student
employment is even less encouraging. There is a gap
between the requirements of companies and student’s
professional ability. In addition, there is a deviation
between the employment psychology of graduates and
theexpectation of companies.Buildingascientificand
reasonable career guidance system, in order to help
students understand society, have clear career goals,
make career plans, enhance their overall qualities, find
suitable jobs, and integrate into society, is particularly
important.
The School of Computer Science at Harbin Insti-
tute of Technology (HIT) attaches great importance to
the career guidance system. Scientific, standardized,
and systematic career guidance is the objective need
for students’ growth and the cultivation of their tal-
ents. From the point of view of the university, this is
to train professionals to adapt to social needs, eventu-
ally achieving the education policies of the Party, and
the target requirements for talent cultivation. From the
point of view of society, it is the requirement of science
and education strategies and the need for enhancing
society and the economy.
We should establish the concept of comprehensive
personal development through a career awareness pro-
gramme, career planning, and a career exploration
process, which will influence students throughout
their life.

TOTAL INVOLVEMENT AND
ESTABLISHMENT OF A
THREE-DIMENSIONAL CAREER
GUIDANCE TEAM
The career guidance system at the computer college
of Harbin Institute of Technology, whose career guid-
ance personnel is made up of career guidance teachers,
instructors, class advisers, and professional teach-
ers, who all together cooperatively integrate aspects
of work such as recruitment, teaching, management,
career guidance, and so on. In addition, they integrate
ideological education into a career guidance system,
reaching the aim of a comprehensive education. Dif-
ferent types of career guidance play different roles
from different perspectives, to guarantee the consistent
focus and concern of the leadership on a college stu-
dent’s career guidance, as well as active coordination
andparticipationofrelatedfunctionaldepartmentsand
teachers. In this system, since entering school, every
aspect and every stage of career planning of students
have corresponding instructors to provide a service
to help and guide to them, and when recruiting com-
panies select graduates, they can gain authorized and
reliableinformationprovidedbycareerpersonnelfrom
different departments of school.

REINFORCING ABILITY CULTIVATION
AND IMPROVING CAREER COMPETENCE
Helping students to gain more qualities and abilities
needed by enterprises is the basis for improving career
competence, as well as the key to improving career
quality. There have been students with great school
achievements, but with bad ability in programming
practical applications, therefore when gaining employ-
ment they would reveal their shortcomings and be
confronted with frustration many times. This situation
has enlightened the teachers who are responsible for
students’ career prospects, which shows that there is a
certain distance between the original emphasis on cul-
tivation through research, and a solid theoretical basis
with enterprise emphasis on practical operational abil-
ity. After all, there are more than 80% of graduates
having to take careers each year, and 50% of under-
graduatesenteringintoacareer.Inthemeantime,when
emphasizing theory, the question on how to improve
the practical ability and innovative ability of students
is also a subject that concerns colleges. Colleges have
a deep understanding that making a good career work
does not just mean sending students to enterprises, but
also generates feedback about the needs of enterprises.
Under the guidance of research topics “11th five-
year plan” – “tracking survey of graduate talents”,
of higher level education academy in Heilongjiang
Province, the college surveys the demand for talents of
some important employers, such as Baidu, Huawei and
Langchao etc., in forms of questionnaire investigation,
communication and interviews. Then we summarize
the real requirement of companies for the students’
ability, and report it to the leaders and career guid-
ance committee of college in time. In the meantime,
when the college emphasizes theoretical cultivation,
it also seizes the opportunity to cultivate the practi-
cal ability of students, and emphasizes experimental
work, with setting of 96 class hours for software design
and development practice, and 48 class hours for com-
puter design and practice, as well as 48 class hours for
embedded system design and practice courses, as to
the requirements of enterprises for embedded tech-
nology and talents. The college also strives to develop
an annual innovation project plan, a research centre
student academic club, effectively improving the prac-
tical ability and engineering development ability of
students, and improving the core career competence
of students.

STRENGTHENING THE COOPERATION
BETWEEN COLLEGES AND ENTERPRISES
AND GETTING THROUGH THE GREEN
CHANNEL TO EMPLOYMENT
Students lack clear understanding of industries and
enterprises, knowing little about their demand for
human resources when finding jobs. Besides, compa-
nies only enter colleges when recruiting, so they have
no opportunity to find out more about students. This
leads to a universal problem. In order to address this
problem, the department of computer science estab-
lished an HR base, student clubs, and high quality
courses together with enterprises, thus building up
an enterprise-oriented platform for students, in order
to help them stand out while looking for jobs in
outstanding enterprises.
The department encourages students to join in Edu-
cation Ministry-Microsoft’s key laboratory for lan-
guage and sound, HIT-IBM research laboratory of
China, Harbin Institute of Technology-Tencent joint
lab and other personnel training bases. The depart-
ment held 6 Microsoft summer school programmes
and other brand activities, setting up a broad platform
for the majority of students to get in touch with the
latest technology and industry applications. The CS
department, Xinchao, Sina, Baidu, Sogou and such
large IT companies established student clubs, and by
organizing related technical training and skills con-
tests, they invited enterprise personnel to carry out
lectures about technology and culture. They built up a
bridge of understanding between students and enter-
prises. During recent three years, the department of
computer science of HIT has nearly 200 students rec-
ommended for a direct interview by the clubs. The
clubs have become the buffer pool for students to
“warm-up” to their ideal companies and the “pool of
talent students” for enterprises to attract outstanding
students. In addition, Department of Computer Sci-
ence in Harbin Institute of Technology also sets up
excellent courses with enterprises, bringing in the lat-
est technology and typical cases into the classroom.
Because most banks use IBM servers, many under-
graduates who learned IBM server related courses are
preferred by many companies.

CONSTRUCTING PERFECT SYSTEM OF
CAREER GUIDENCE FOR LEADING
STUDENTS TO FIND A CLEAR
EMPLOYMENT DIRECTION
Career planning and employment guidance commit-
tees are set up in each year to constantly improve
the whole process of an employment guidance sys-
tem. In the situation where junior students are unclear
about professional knowledge and deep understanding
of the industry situation, the department held “mas-
ters in small classes activities in depth, and invited
well-known experts and scholars to join classes and be
face-to-face with students to have in-depth discussion,
and to get close with students to talk about the history
of computer science, career planning, and academic
and industry prospects. A number of senior profes-
sors from our department actively promote Computers
Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow” lecture courses,
helping younger students to solve the problems such as
what is a computer? What is its use? What do we learn
from them and put in future use?” They also address a
series of other problems.
To deal with the confusion about career direction
and job-searching skills of senior students, the school
186

actively carry out Approach to Workplace activities,
inviting well-paid graduates, employers, and HR staff
to give lectures or workshops to share career advice
and job experience, and guide students in order to
wisely find their jobs.
The school continues to use innovative training
methods. It makes full use of various resources to
provide a variety of forms, multi-angle training, guid-
ance, and training for students. These include courses,
forums, seminars, employment networks, counselling,
school-enterprise cooperation in training, experiential
training, and so on. Among them, experiential train-
ing, has been attracting the attention of a growing
number of colleges and universities. It references the
company’s human resources training to take a new,
efficient model, in order to make the training object
acquire new knowledge, skills, and attitudes through
personal intervention practice methods. It lets students
learn teamwork, communication skills, and decision-
making abilities in the activities by themselves, and
then make it a habit of thinking and behaviour. So that
students benefit endlessly in employment and future
work.
6
PERFECT SERVICE SYSTEM, HELPING
STUDENT TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS
The School of Computer Science andTechnology con-
stantly sums up experience in a working environment,
and builds and improves the student employment ser-
vice system. Through the preparation of the School
of Computer Science Employment Guidance Manual,
the school opened a variety of information platforms
of all types such as QQ group, Fetion Groups, and pub-
lic mailboxes to solve various problems that students
encounter in the course of employment.
The college formed a weekly calendar on employ-
ment to help students to organize employers, and on
the day of recruitment, we remind each student to
participate in recruiting by Fetion. In the quarter of
employment cases, the employment information sys-
tem of the school has withstood various challenges.
It costs less than half an hour for releasing employment
information to each student. The system received high
praise from employers and students. The high-quality
service offered by teachers in our school is highly
trusted and affirmed by the students. Before the sign-
ing a contract, most students discuss the conditions
and treatments with their teachers who are in charge
of career guidance, especially regarding the choice of
multiple offers, where a teacher can give a student an
adequate guidance and help.
As there are many students from poor families have
trouble in employment, the college could use help of
the committee of the Boat of Hope. Based on friendly
service,thecommitteefocusesondevelopingstudents’
skills and ability. It regularly organizes network archi-
tecture and web design training sessions to enhance
students’ professional skills, and insists on carrying
out the story-sharing sessions and lectures, known
as “I dare say” to continuously improve their com-
munication skills. During recent years, students from
poor families in our school not only achieve a 100%
employment rate, but also can find high-quality jobs.

ABSTRACT:
The division of a micro-video course content is needed in order to think about decomposition
and correlation design of the course content. This paper analyses the principle of dividing a micro-video course
content, and defines the connotation and classification of knowledge points in a micro-video course. Based on
the analysis of instructional objectives, the decomposition of a micro-video course content can be implemented
by the methods of classification analysis, interpretative structural modelling, and hierarchy analysis. In addition,
based on analysing the type and relations of knowledge points, ontology metadata modelling of knowledge
points can make the knowledge points correlate with each other, ensuring the integrity of the micro-video course
content, and the reusability of the instructional micro-video with a knowledge point-based design.

INTRODUCTION
As Khan Academy, MOOC (Massive open online
course), and other online course resources have been
paid attention to all over the world, the related research
on online courses is becoming an important issue. One
common characteristic of these course resources is that
the main carrier is instructional micro-video. In the
research, these kind of courses will be called micro-
video courses, which are the total of instructional
contents and instructional activities in a certain sub-
ject or theme, represented by a micro-teaching video.
It includes instructional contents and learning environ-
ments with specific teaching objectives and strategies.
The main carrier of instructional content is the instruc-
tional micro-video which is a kind of instructional and
educational micro resource.
Therefore, the micro-video course content is com-
posed of several instructional micro-videos based on
instructional objectives and instructional strategies,
according to some sequential structures. To ensure the
reusability and sharing of course resources, the divi-
sion of micro-video course content needs to consider
the decomposition and correlation of the course con-
tent, which means we need to consider how to divide
the course content into specific knowledge points,
according to instructional objectives. Those knowl-
edge points are correlated with each other, thus the
course content cannot only be presented by instruc-
tional micro-videos, but must also ensure the integrity
of the course content and the reusability of the instruc-
tional micro-videos. How to design the decomposition
and correlation of a micro-video course content will
be discussed and explored in the research.
2
THE PRINCIPLE OF DECOMPOSING
COURSE CONTENT
The division method and granularity of course con-
tent have played a decisive role in the application
of knowledge points in the curriculum knowledge
system. Whether the decomposition of micro-video
course content is scientific and reasonable will be
directly related to the practice and application of a
micro-video course. The design of the micro-video
course content is based on the concept of knowledge
point design from the perspective of the micro-level
design, therefore, the decomposition of the micro-
video course content needs to pay attention to the
following principles.
2.1
Loose coupling of course structure content
Although the micro-video course is composed of a
number of instructional micro-videos with intact and
independent meaning, which does not mean that the
micro-video courses do not have a course structure,
the knowledge structure, or that there is no correla-
tion between the videos. The system and structure of
the course content do not have fixed standards, and
what is more, there will be difference among sub-
jects. However, the loose coupling of a course structure
needs to be considered in order to achieve the recon-
struction and sharing of the course, and construct
dynamic, open, sharing, and personalized courses,
which means that the course content is relatively inde-
pendent. However, the content needs be correlated
in some reasonable structure relationship in order to
ensure modularity and relevance of the course content.
189

2.2
The teaching content is formed in several
knowledge points
The micro-video course is a new course form that
meets the needs of fragmental learning and micro-
learning. In order to conform to the characteristic
of fragmental learning style and meet the needs of
learning context, instructional micro-videos include a
micro and a short knowledge content, which means
that the course content needs to be decomposed in a
certain model and method.Therefore, in the demand of
keeping course systematized and content miniaturized,
the decomposition of a micro-video course content
is mainly based on- knowledge points design in the
research.
2.3
The reusability of knowledge points
From the perspective of a resource construction, the
content design of micro-video courses should consider
the characteristics of reusability. In the domain knowl-
edge ontology base, the Reusable Knowledge Point
(RPK) has constructed a reusable knowledge object
with finer granularity, which has made the knowledge
sharing on the knowledge point of domain knowledge
ontology, and can effectively improve the efficiency
of a course design and development. The knowledge
point is a type of an independent and reusable course
component. Furthermore, the curriculum always con-
sists of learning objectives and several knowledge
points which are from the domain knowledge ontology
base.

THE DECOMPOSITION AND CORRELATION
DESIGN OF THE COURSE CONTENT
BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE POINT
The decomposition design of a micro-video course
content is to divide and design knowledge points, defi-
nite teaching sub-objectives based on analysing teach-
ing objectives and learners’ characteristics, and then
determine the content of knowledge point according
to teaching sub-objectives, at last the course content
can be divided into a series of knowledge units and
knowledge points.
The size of a knowledge point varies from different
instructional designers. The structure of curriculum
is based on the knowledge point which is the small-
est knowledge unit. So we shall analyse that how
to carry on the division of knowledge point and the
decomposition strategy based on knowledge points
below.
3.1
The connotation and classification of a
knowledge point
3.1.1
The connotation of a knowledge point
The knowledge point is a general, abstract, and old
concept, which means a different content from the dif-
ferent perspective.A knowledge point is a collection of
knowledge with relatively intact logical sense from the
aspect of content. In this research, the knowledge point
refers to the basic unit for transmitting instructional
information, and it is a set of knowledge that have
relatively intact meaning, and can carry out the rel-
atively independent evaluation. The knowledge point
is the micro-videos’ smallest learning unit; the size of
knowledge point is related to the course structure and
content.
3.1.2
The classification of knowledge points in
micro-video courses
The knowledge point in a micro-video course has a
top-down and hierarchical structure. According to the
content of knowledge granularity, knowledge points
contain a meta-knowledge point and a compound
knowledge point. The meta = knowledge point is that
the content is indivisible, and the compound knowl-
edge point is composed of two or more than two
meta-knowledge points, as shown in Figure 1. The
micro-video course can contain one or more knowl-
edge modules, and a knowledge module (knowledge
unit) is composed of a number of knowledge points.
The size of knowledge granularity affects the
reusability of knowledge points and the length of the
instructional micro-video. In general, a knowledge
point with smaller granularity contains less knowledge
capacity, and a shorter duration of the instructional
micro-video. For example, the micro-video course
Laundry Tips from the website named several min-
utes net (http://www.jifenzhong.com/lesson/272) is a
knowledge module which consists of nine instruc-
tional micro-videos; each instructional micro-video
explains one knowledge point. For example, those
knowledge points respectively explain how to wash
towels, how to clean a bra and panties, how to wash
a silk scarf, how to wash shirt collars, and so on. The
length of each instructional micro-video is generally
not more than 2 minutes.
3.2
Course content decomposition based on
teaching objectives
In order to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of a
coursecontent,thecoursecontentwhichisdividedinto
knowledge points, needs to analyse teaching objec-
tives, therefore the decomposition of micro-video
course content mainly adopts the following methods.
3.2.1
Classified analysis
Classified analysis is where we first need to determine
the main categories of the course content, conclude
knowledge content into several subjects or modules
according to the category, and then decide on the
structure and range of the teaching content. It is suit-
able for the content of courses without rigorous logic
levels or programmes, for example, the course case
Creative Handicraft in Kindergartens. This research
mostly used classified analysis, which classified the
handicraft material, such as jars, cotton, reusable bags,
cups, paper, and so on, and then analysed and designed
creative handicraft according to the material used.

3.2.2
Interpretative structural modelling
Interpretative structural modelling is an effective
method to analyse and reveal complex structures,
which can decompose complex, disorder relationship
of each element in the system into clear, multi-level,
hierarchical structure. Many courses have adopted this
method at Khan Academy.
The processes of using interpretative structural
modelling method to analyse a course content are as
follows: First, extracting the core concept or the theory
of course content, and then carrying on the teaching
around these keywords and concepts. Second, find-
ing the relationship among the core keywords, form
a knowledge network by using a connection between
two knowledge points, and then form a relatively intact
course knowledge circle.
Because the structure relationship between these
courses content is more complex, in order to pro-
mote learners to have the overall framework and macro
understanding of course content, we can create rele-
vance between knowledge points by the knowledge
map. For example, micro-video courses “trigonome-
try” at Khan Academy is about the edges and corners’
relationship between a plane triangle and a spherical
triangle, and it includes 39 instructional micro-videos.
Therefore this micro-video course is divided into a
number of core concepts, including basic trigonom-
etry, trigonometric, trigonometric equation, trigono-
metric application, etc., and then the relationships
between those concepts is established.
3.2.3
Analytical hierarchy
Analytical hierarchy is a type of a content analysis
method and an inverse analysis process, which is used
to reveal the subordinate skills required by teaching
objectives. If the course has a strict knowledge struc-
ture and a clear hierarchy content, this method can be
adopted.The level of knowledge points is related to the
difficulty level of the knowledge points. If the knowl-
edge point is at the bottom, the difficulty level is lower.
If the knowledge point is at the top, the difficulty level
is higher. For example, a micro-video course Prepara-
tory Arithmetic and Algebra at Khan Academy is a
preparatory course for algebra, and both of them have a
clear knowledge hierarchy in the whole algebra course
structure. Furthermore, there is also a clear hierarchy
on knowledge points of multiplication and division in
the Preparatory Arithmetic and Algebra course.
3.3
Knowledge modelling for promoting
knowledge correlation
The correlation and aggregation of the knowledge
content is the important guarantee of realizing the
integrity and structuralization of a course content and
the correlation and systematization of learns’thinking.
Knowledge modelling is one of important ways to real-
ize the correlation and aggregation of the knowledge
content based on the semantics. There is a descrip-
tion on correlation for knowledge content through
ontology modelling for micro-video knowledge points
as follows.
Figure 1.
The hierarchical relationship of knowledge points.
3.3.1
Analysing the type and relationship of
knowledge points
As mentioned earlier in this research, we mainly
divided types of knowledge points based on the
knowledge nature, namely divided them into factual,
conceptual categories, programmes, and principles.
Knowledge points-based course designing makes a
course into a knowledge network. Therefore, the anal-
ysis for the relationship of the knowledge points is
good for ensuring and analysing the correlation and
its degree, and ensuring the logic and integrity of the
course content in emphasizing the independence of
a content. The relation of knowledge points includes
hierarchy, precursor, correlation, and parallel.
(1) The hierarchical relation of knowledge points.The
hierarchical relation of knowledge points is based
on horizontal and vertical structure of the knowl-
edge points. Horizontal structure refers to that
the relationship between knowledge points is a
peerhierarchyrelationshipandabrotherstructure.
Vertical structure refers to that the relationship
is a parent-child hierarchy relationship between
knowledge points. Take micro-video courses as
examples, the hierarchical relationship of the
knowledge point as shown in Figure 1.
(2) The precursor relation of knowledge points.
When learning a certain knowledge point, another
knowledge point should be mastered first. The
relationship between those knowledge points is
precursor relations. Take the organic chemistry
course at Khan Academy, and the micro-video
course Nomenclature of Alkanes as examples,
those knowledge points range from easy to dif-
ficult and have precursor relations.
(3) The correlation relation of knowledge points. The
correlation relation reveals the network structure
between knowledge points, and points out that
knowledge is composed of a group of mutual
connection and interaction nodes. The correla-
tion relation of knowledge points can be divided
into two categories: firstly, one to one correlation
(1:1). This represents that one knowledge point
only corresponds with another one. Secondly, one
too many correlations (1:n). This represents that

one knowledge point may have a relation with a
number of knowledge points.Take the course sine
function at KhanAcademy as an example, the cor-
relation relationship between knowledge points of
definitions to sine function and sine.
(4) The parallel relation of knowledge points. Com-
pared with the above relations, the parallel relation
of knowledge points does not have a direct rela-
tion and has a weak link. Those knowledge points
are parallel relations, which generally happens in
the condition that the content is divergent and the
logic of structure is not strong.
3.3.2
Ontology metadata model of knowledge
points
In the computer field, ontology mainly refers to
the explicit specification of concepts and relations
between concepts in a specific domain, and indicates
all concepts, relations between those concepts, and
concept properties. Ontology of knowledge points is
the expression of knowledge contents and the rela-
tions between knowledge points. Ontology metadata
of knowledge points can be regarded as the descrip-
tionforattributesofknowledgepoints,whichindicates
nature, functions, and relations, etc. Therefore, the
ontology metadata model of knowledge points for
a micro-video mainly contains the following meta-
data elements: KPid, KP, kw, type, object, description,
and relation. The specific descriptions are shown in
Table 1.
The description of ontology metadata for knowl-
edge points not only promotes the correlation of
knowledge points which have been generated by
decomposing a course’s content, but also aggregate
instructional micro-video and make these instructional
micro-videos reuseable.

CONCLUSION
Decomposition and correlation design are important
parts of designing a micro-video course. It can pro-
vide effective instructional micro-videos for learners’
fragmental learning, and can also achieve the con-
nection between knowledge and aggregation of learn-
ing resources by correlation design. This does not
only ensure the integrity of the course structure, but
also improves the application performance of online
courses and ts sharing and construction.

ABSTRACT:
With the growing of aging population in China, we pay more attention to the elderly chronic
disease, and the care of elderly chronic diseases has gradually become the family and social problem which can’t
be ignored. This paper summarizes the design contents of living environment of chronic diseases in elder which
in consideration of special psychological and physiological characteristics and the nursing care they needed from
the perspective of human nature.

DIABETES MELLITUS
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is mostly diabetes mellitus
type 2, referring to those people who are over sixty
years old and in vivo due to insufficient insulin secre-
tion or impaired insulin secretion, cause the human
endocrine disorders, leading to human body mate-
rial metabolism disorder. Thus, metabolic disorders of
hyperglycaemia and high blood cholesterol as well as
disorders of protein, water, and electrolytes occur. At
the same time, diabetes mellitus type 2 patients have
high incidence of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, high
fat, hyperinsulinism, and also coronary disease, which
is called X syndrome or metabolic syndrome.

Sensory system
As age progresses, vision, hearing, tactile sensation, taste sense, and olfactory sensation all
weaken; meanwhile, the ability to adapt to temperature change and a sensitivity to extreme
climates weakens.
Motional system
Flexibility and the power of muscles gradually weakens. Activities are restricted and the risk of
cataclasis increases. The ability to walk and understand weakens.
Central nervous system
The ability to react and the concept-forming ability weaken; flexibility and agility are reduced.
Ability for keeping one’s balance weakens. Energy and power are easily lost and depression
easily occurs.
Urinary system
Nocturia occurs. Due to increased urination, sleep quality is affected and insomnia becomes
more severe. Meanwhile, with the increase of urine in the bladder, uracratia is aggravated.
Respiratory system and
vasculature
Activities are restricted; fatigue easily occurs; energy and power are easily lost; activities without
confidence.

This paper will take the psychological and physio-
logical characteristics of DM patients as examples, and
then analyse their environmental elements, in order
to explore the environment design points for disabled
elderly people.

DESIGN OF RESIDENTIAL SPACE OF DM
2.1
Barrier to sensory system
Among all the internal senses, vision is the most
important feeling. Besides the apparent vision weak-
ening, the concurrent pathology of the eyes of people
195

with DM includes the visual area, the dark adapta-
tion ability the regulating function and the different
degrees of color perception. For the mobility of the
elderly, observation is the main way to feel the external
environment.
The light environment in a residential space is very
important. Indoor lighting forms include natural light
and artificial light. DM patients will spend most of
their time indoors. Therefore the design of the indoor
lighting environment should not only satisfy the light-
ing requirements but also combined with the use of
functional.
(1) Natural lighting
The most important part in the design of a lighting
environment is natural light because the natural light
is most consistent with the degree of adaptation to light
eyes. Natural light can enable the elderly to feel the dif-
ference between day and night more clearly, which is
beneficial to their physical and mental health. Mean-
while, ultraviolet rays in natural light do not only kill
off harmful bacteria, but also promote the absorption
of calcium
In order to provide a comfortable residential envi-
ronment for the elderly, bedrooms should be arranged
to face the best orientation in the whole design. A
glass curtain wall can be used to guarantee sufficient
light, but appropriate sunshade measures also should
be adopted.At the same time, the indoor window glass
should not be made of coloured glass that will hinder
the vision of the elderly
The most common indoor lighting method in our
country is unidirectional lighting. It should avoid daz-
zle and the depth of a room can not be too long. Mean-
while, increase the artificial lighting in the opposite
window wall to balance the illumination or sunshade
curtains can be used; when the natural lighting is too
strong, some of the rays can be shaded so that the entire
indoor lighting is comfortable. Sufficient indoor light-
ing can help prevent the elderly from falling down
and also help them concentrate. But if the light is
too strong, will cause confusion, excitement and even
affect the walking balance.
The eyes of DM patients are slow in adapting to
light. If the light between two spaces is different, a
bufferspaceshouldbeprovidedbetweenthem,inorder
to leave enough time for eyes to adapt to the change.
(2) Artificial lighting
Aiming at the vision barrier caused by DM and in order
to satisfy the physiological and psychological needs of
the elderly, indirect lighting systems should be used to
provide sufficient lighting grades and avoid the strong
light when the natural lighting is insufficient and at
nights. Meanwhile, the design should try not to use
dim lighting; using an all-optical spectrum and light
source can reflect more accurate colours of people and
objects, and can also reduce eye fatigue.
For the DM patients, because of its physiological
functionandflexibilitysignificantlyimpairedeyesight
low. In the lighting design, a warm light source should

Figure 2.1.2.
Bright artificial lighting.
(Source: Own photographs)
be used in order to improve the illumination level and
a bright residential environment helps open the mind
of the elderly.
The lighting design of residential spaces should also
avoid dazzle. The sleeping time of DM patients is
longer therefore an indirect lighting method should
be adopted. To avoid the elderly directly see the light
source on the bed. Lamps and lanterns should be of
diffused and reflective types, all the lamps should be
installed with appropriate shades, and the height of
lamps should be restricted. Indoor walls, suspended
ceilings, and floors, all should all be decorated using
non-gloss paints, in order to avoid creating dazzle.
Meanwhile, the use of auxiliary light sources can
be a practical way to make adjustments for the entire
indoor environment. Bedside lamps not only facili-
tate the individual activities of the elderly but also
satisfy the lighting needs of nursing staff when car-
ing for the elderly. Meanwhile, the bedside lights can
strengthen the old man’s personal space, enhance the
confidentiality.
(3) Colour of environment
The living space of color suitable for harmonic color
smart, low saturation, the interior space of the col-
ors should be coordinated and unified. Among them,
achieve the indicating effect local prominent in color,
the common areas such as stairs, emergency exits,
opening direction of fire door, floor signs, room
signs, reminder signs, telephones, doorbells, lifts, and
safetypilotlampsshouldbeindicatedwithoutstanding
colours.
With weakening vision caused by DM, the feeling
towards colour for the elderly will change accordingly.

Forexample, it is difficulttoidentifytheyellow.There-
fore, a sign board with yellow characters on a white
background should be avoided.Yellow on green should
also be avoided, will the people of skin color reflection
looks like a patient. Meanwhile, colours of a similar
hue should be avoided because this combination can
cause elderly confusion.
DM patients have difficulties in distinguishing
space so when the space is changed, the height of the
ground visually changes, and in some places which
need a special reminder, an apparent border line should
be provided.. If necessary, hues should be used for
emphasis. The top tread of the stairs should be high-
lighted by colours; the front of the Stair tread should
set a clear color antiskid warning.
(4) Space temperature and humidity
The ability of adapting to temperature change and
sensation to extreme climates of DM patients weak-
ens, therefore the change of indoor temperature and
humidity will also influence the health of the elderly.
Generally speaking, summer temperatures between
2l–32◦C and 24–26◦C are the most ideal; winter tem-
peratures between 16–20◦C and 16–18◦C are the most
ideal.
2.2
Barrier to motional system
The flexibility and the power of the muscles of DM
patients gradually weaken. Therefore, activities are
restricted, the risk of fracture increases, and the ability
to walk and understand weakens. Mild diabetes melli-
tus has symptoms of asymmetric progressive muscular
weakness,alongwithmusclepain,inthemuscleofcin-
gulum extremitatis inferioris and the pectoral girdle,
which is called diabetic amyotrophy.
Handrail materials should have a good durability,
and be of high strength and fine tenacity. Handrails
are usually made of strengthened plastics or plastic
steel supported by lining metal materials, which has
the advantages of being easy to clean, anti-corrosive,
anti static and do not fade.
In an indoor environment, the ground is the space
interface that people contact most; the tactile sensa-
tionthatthegroundreflectstopeopleisthemostdirect.
Within the residential space of the elderly, soft wooden
floors and Elastic plastic materials are ideal materials,
Figure 2.2.

which have the ability for heat preservation and noise
absorption, as well as elasticity and a soft tactile sen-
sation. What is more, due to the walking difficulties
and special physiological problems of the elderly, non-
slip, dirt resistant, and easy to clean materials should
also be considered.
Within the elderly’s residential space, blankets are
not suitable. Thick blankets always lead to tripping
over; by contrast, light blankets do not have that defect.
But no matter what kind of material is not easy to clean
thecarpet,atthesametimeasthebacteriareproduction
of space.
Emergency alarm systems should be installed.Tele-
vision sets, lamps, and curtains should be set up to be
close at hand. In addition, when the elderly encounter
a danger or the symptoms of illness occur, as long as
they press the button of the emergency alarm system,
doctors and nurses should arrive immediately.
2.3
Barrier to central nervous system
Ability to react and form concepts weakens; flexi-
bility and agility reduces; ability for keeping one’s
balance weakens; energy and power are easily lost,
and depression easily occurs.
Sound will influence one’s mood and the attitude
toward objective things. Too much silence will aggra-
vate loneliness but too much noise will influence
sleep and health. The biggest factor that influences
the hearing of the elderly is noise.
Doors and windows are the main channels for
spreading sound. Indoor doors and windows should
do noise reduction and also be installed with double-
glazed glass and hollow sounding insulating doors.
Within the residential space, the areas where fur-
niture touches the ground should be equipped with
soft mats. Interior can be used sound-absorbing perfor-
mance good decoration materials, to weaken the effect
ofnoiseonindoorenvironment.Inaddition,shoulduse
the reduction of stone and suction noise effect of poor
material.
A pleasant smelling environment is also very impor-
tant. Odours and emotions have strong connections,
which will directly affect people’s mood and comfort.
A pleasant smell will calm them down and release
psychological pressure.

Green plants is quite important in improving air
quality. Plants not only absorb carbon dioxide and
release oxygen, but also get rid of harmful materials
such as formaldehyde.

Barrier to urinary system
Nocturia occurs. Due to increased urination, sleep
quality is affected and insomnia becomes more severe.
Meanwhile, through the increase of urine in the
bladder, uracratia is aggravated.
The time taken for DM patients to adapt to a dark
environment is longer. When they go to the bathroom
in the night, a prolonged light contrast will lead to
visual barriers, therefore a night light or lamps of
adjustable brightness can be used to solve the prob-
lem. In addition, if it is not convenient for the elderly
to search for the switch at night, the switch should
be set up in a convenient place, such as the front of
the bed. A return circuit switch, an induction switch,
or a night light of low brightness in the corridors can
be adopted. In residential spaces, a perfect intelligent
lighting system can help promote life quality.
In addition, a snow bright bathroom will perplex the
aged, therefore dark walls and white sanitary ware will
easily help the elderly find the toilet so as to reduce
incontinence.
If urination at night increases, the consequent noise
will disrupt other elderly people, so the drainage
system should do denoising processing. Appropriate
sanitation units should be chosen. If possible, use the
quiet toilet
Unpleasant odours will cause breathing and heart-
beat rates to become too fast, which can further
influence health. Especially for those who spend most

of their time in bed, a single room or one’s own bath-
room can reduce this influence. A ventilation system
should be installed, which will help raise the air quality
and create a pleasant smelling environment.

SUMMARY
Although nowadays the treatment for DM in our coun-
try is still limited, but we can investigate the key details
of diabetes by elderly vision, hearing, touch and smell
the living space environment, into the humane care, to
provide a warm and comfortable environment for the
elderly with chronic diseases, so as to improve their
living feeling a positive.

Teaching reform and practice of industry design specialty based on the
Conceive, Design, Implement, and Operate (CDIO) engineering
education pattern

ABSTRACT:
CDIO is an engineering educational concept. This paper analyses the feasibility that puts
the CDIO engineering education pattern into the industrial design major. For industrial design major of the
Zhengzhou Institute of Aeronautical Industry Management, the paper introduces the preliminary exploration
and experience in guiding the mode into the teaching reform of industrial design specialty, in order to provide a
teaching reference for the industrial design course at undergraduate colleges and universities.
1
MODE OF HIGHER ENGINEERING
EDUCATION
CDIO stands for Conceive, Design, Implement, and
Operate. It is currently a concept of talent cultiva-
tion of higher engineering education, its name inspired
by the life cycle processes of product/system, which
embodies the life circle from development stage to
the modify and abandon stage of the modern indus-
trial products. Based on the current situation, CDIO
higher engineering education model takes the con-
ception, design, implementation, and operation as the
carrier to train students’ability for engineering, which
includes not only academic knowledge, but also stu-
dents’ life-long learning skills, team communication
ability, and system control ability.
CDIO emphasizes cultivating the comprehensive
innovative capability of students through the project
process (concept-design-implement-runs) to meet the
employment needs of the industry, which coincides
with the basic ideas of professional education. CDIO
educational philosophy has a strong systematic rigor
and operability, which is inspiring and instructive
for the improvement of the professional training pro-
gramme.

TEACHING REFORM AND PRACTICE OF
INDUSTRIAL DESIGN
a) Curriculum integration
According to engineering requirements for higher
engineering education, engineering colleges and uni-
versities should offer four courses: personality edu-
cation curriculum, engineering science and natural
science courses, social sciences, a humanities sci-
ence course, and an engineering course. Each course
may include a core course (compulsory), a series
of elective courses and the corresponding teaching
practice (experimental courses, course-related training
activities, internships, social activities, etc.). Industrial
design courses present various professional courses
and specialized courses for reintegration based on
the specific needs of professional settings, forming
a course which takes the product design as the core
course and consolidates the basic knowledge. Prac-
tical teaching includes a corresponding curriculum
(transport thematic design, furniture design), an exper-
imental course, a graduation project (actual design
or simulation design, engineering, and testing) and a
proper engineering training. Graduation design should
be prompted to strengthen students’ integrated appli-
cation of engineering knowledge and engineering
capacity.
In the training programme of industrial design, in
accordance with the intellectual content, an integrated
curriculum can be divided into: modelling, engineer-
ing, engineering technology, design theory and expres-
sion, humanities and social sciences, and economics
management. Project courses can be divided into:
professional foundation, foundation design, improve-
ment, and innovation. Practice teaching includes:
internship, curriculum design, and graduation design.
A CDIO model places great emphasis on the
cooperation of the project class, integration courses,
and practice teaching. Figure I lists the correspon-
dence relationship among the project class, the inte-
gration course, and practical teaching. CDIO-based
industrial design is different from the traditional
three-section structure (basic course- basic special-
ized courses-specialized courses). The former takes

training.
capacity development as the core which develops
students’ comprehensive ability of problem finding,
analysis and problem-solving, and communication
and cooperation through the project course. In the
meantime, it prompts students’ self-study ability. This
kind of structure may cultivate the students with a
strong ability to learn, solve new problems, and adapt
to new environments. Today, the social environment
changes very quickly. New problems and new situa-
tions require practitioners to have strong abilities for
problem-solving and innovation.
Through the CDIO approach in accordance with the
project life cycle, related courses can be associated by
teaching, learning and practicing, with the result of
avoiding unnecessary duplication, and enabling stu-
dents to master the course linkage between knowledge
and the solved synthesis problems. A CDIO approach
integrates teaching plans and curricula, breaks the bar-
riers between teachers and courses, and better supports
professional training goals.
b) Project teaching practice
Traditional teaching emphasizes knowledge special-
ization, and ignores knowledge of relevance and com-
prehensiveness.Therefore, industrial design education
curricula at colleges and universities, and the enter-
prises’ demand for industrial designers have certain
deviations, as shown in Figure 1.
A CDIO mode of engineering education enables
students to learn and practice according to the project
cycle, which is fully in line with the teaching
of industrial design education. Therefore, industrial
design specialty arranges teaching for project teaching
sequencing,takingprojectsasmotivationtostrengthen
the skills, and expertise learning to implement project
teaching.
Real designing is not to be found in the book.
The product will encounter countless details likely
to impact the final outcome from the bidding to the
final sale.Throughout the production process, ranging
from the early market demand and idea generation, to
design, manufacture, sales, and feedback, a designer
is involved in the entire process. In between, there are
problems that can be solved using books and school
experience, or details can be handled by accumu-
lated experience. A CDIO project advocates “learning
out of practicing”, that is, the students’ abilities are
improved in the courses of practice. The philosophy
of “learning out of practicing” lies in the practical
programme, which helps students not only to gain the-
oretical knowledge but also to culticate team spirit
though practice.
With school-enterprise cooperation teaching, stu-
dents are required to discuss their idea with the
enterprise while designing, to make proper sequence
in accordance with work procedures while programme
organizing, to implement in accordance with the con-
ception, design, action, operation while carrying out
programme, to know exactly about the production
process. Students improved their capacity and accu-
mulated experience through practice. For the imple-
mentation of a project-teaching concept, we joined the
Industrial Design Association, the County of Henan
province people’s government, as well as companies
such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to introduce the enter-
prise’s production and management within schools,
and supervise the teaching process and quality of the
training base together. Colleges offer office and pro-
duction sites, the training classes are on their sites,
the equipment in the training class and the com-
pany’s production equipment are fully compatible, and
practice is in accordance with the company’s pro-
duction processes and the technical requirements. At
present, the College of Art and Design Research Cen-
ter covers an area of more than 3,000 square metres;
instruments amount to 5.3 million dollars. The estab-
lishment of the Innovation Lab especially has provided
a platform for exchanges and cooperation. During
implementation, we introduce a teaching model of
team cooperation. A team is usually made up of
6–8 students by free combination, captain election,
and a clear division of responsibilities. After the
completion of project ideas and project designs, a rep-
resentative produces a design report, which will be
evaluated and scored by all the members. The teams
approved continue sequential projects while the teams
unapproved have to redesign the current project. After
the project, students are required to make a sum-
mary and share with each other, so as to develop the
design further, and improve and consolidate the stu-
dents’ ability for team communication, coordination,
and cooperation.
At the same time, students at different grades are
trained to participate in industrial design competitions
at home and abroad, in accordance with the differ-
ences of teaching plans and the mastery of professional
skills. Exercising students’ comprehensive practical
abilities through competitions, effectively implements
the concept of “learning by game” and builds their
200

self-confidence for their future work. In recent years,
substantially increasing are not only the number of
students awarded but also the awarding levels in indus-
trial design competitions at home and abroad, which
witnesses the periodical success in the practice of
teaching reform.
In the teaching courses, a teacher should establish
small-scale practical projects according to the teach-
ing needs. This should help students to understand
more about the course content and application through
curriculum development project training. The current
curriculum projects mainly in the form of programme
operations, such as a ceramic design in the course
of Basis of Product Design. This project requires
students to collect ceramics-related info, including
brands, prices, categories, styles, functions, and even
to bind the relevant paper info into booklets. Stu-
dents will take the initiative to collect information
during the implementation process, and get a more
profound understanding of the properties and uses of
the materials by comparison. Design is fundamen-
tal to the project. In terms of cultivating students’
practical capability, colleges should take cooperation
between schools and enterprises as the main line of
the project, and make students learn by doing, which
is supported by the competitions at home and abroad,
and is based on the simulation course and the core
curriculum.
c) Deepening the undergraduate tutorial system
Teachers are another important element in CDIO engi-
neering education. Teachers are the keys in cultivating
innovative talents and practicing the CDIO educa-
tional mode. The undergraduate tutorial system will
improve college students’ability for innovation, and is
a useful addition to high-quality talent training and
teaching quality improvement. The CDIO model is
implemented with extremely high requirements for
teachers. To train students with the required capac-
ity in CDIO, teachers should be well-prepared with
a wealth of experience, a long-term cooperation with
enterprises in all fields, and a deeper insight of the
CDIO model. The long-term discipline-orientation in
China resulted in the separation of engineering edu-
cation and practice, and teachers lack comprehensive
ability and practical ability training, which is a great
challenge for us.
The CDIO engineering education reform, as far as
teachers are concerned, provides certain opportunities
and offers as a beneficial platform.With the “taking in,
send out (inviting professionals out of college to give
lectures and sending out teachers to be trained out-
side)” approach, teachers have been involved in the
design of enterprise practice, improved their teaching
ability, their engineering practice ability, and taken in
the teaching contents and methods reform. In the prac-
tice of tutor systems for undergraduates, teachers can
further contribute to effective implementation of the
CDIO mode.

TEACHING EFFECT ANALYSIS OF CDIO
MODE IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION
The CDIO mode derives from Europe and America.
The reform involves various aspects of the reform of
engineering education, and may have positive impli-
cations to colleges from different countries at different
levels, and even with different circumstances. This
study mainly selected the CDIO pilot courses as study
objects, to clarify achievements and the existing prob-
lemsthroughtheinvestigationandanalysisofstudents’
learning outcomes and satisfaction levels.
The CDIO mode requires professional theoretical
knowledge, practical abilities, design skills, team-
work, communication skills, finding and problem-
solving abilities, and a sense of responsibility.
Thus, it is necessary to examine the learning effect,
so as to examine the application effect of the CDIO
mode.Throughthesurveyfound(asshowninFigure2)
that the improvement on students’ teamwork skills,
practical skills, and communication skills were quite
obvious, while the improvement on their theoretical
knowledge, designing capability, and problem solv-
ing capabilities was not so visible. Pilot classes were
carried out in basic courses for freshers and sopho-
mores, the CDIO project-based teaching is not yet
fully expanded, and therefore, once the CDIO project-
based teaching is applied over the next two years,
the improvement of students’designing ability will be
much more visible.

CONCLUSION
Through the CDIO mode, the reform and practice
on the teaching of industrial designing has exerted
positive influence on the traditional teaching mode.
Through the integration of courses and practice of
project teaching, the CDIO teaching training should
fit the teaching contents, and improve teaching meth-
ods to enhance the ability to solve practical problems.
Through constant searching and reforming in the
courses of teaching practice, interdisciplinary indus-
trial designers will be cultivated in accordance with
the general background of “created in China” which
comes out of the requirement on industrial trans-
formation and upgrading development. That is, new

industrial designing talents with design creativity and
humanities, engineering technical knowledge and art,
and ethical standards and social responsibility.

Focusing on the mental health of rural left-behind children
Xiaoling Yang
Baoding Vocational and Technical College
ABSTRACT:
The children left behind are a special group, the relevance ratio of their mental health problems
is higher, and their mental health is worrying. Their psychological problems are the results of the interaction
among many factors including school, community, parents, guardians and left-behind children, and forming a
joint force from schools, families and communities is the main measure to solve the psychological problems of
children left behind.
Keywords:
left-behind children, mental health, psychological problems
“Left-behind children” refer to children who are left
at home or staying with relatives due to their par-
ents working outside hometown, and they lead lives
without parents for a long time. Specifically, it refers
to children left behind in rural areas and separated
from one or both parents. According to the estima-
tion of National Bureau of Statistics, the number of
“left-behind children” in rural China is more than
58,000,000. With the transfer of surplus rural labor
to urban area, the number of rural left-behind chil-
dren is increasing. As these left-behind children are in
the critical period of growing and developing, receiv-
ing compulsory education, and initially forming of
enlightenment and view of life and world, the perennial
lack of parental and family care and education would
adversely affect their growth.
1
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF
LEFT-BEHIND CHILDREN
1.1
Abnormal development of individual mental
characteristics
For personality traits, left-behind children often show
two tendencies: introversion, social withdrawal, poor
communication skills with people; irritability, impul-
sion or being too naughty, making some special action
to attract the teacher to notice themselves.
1.2
Deviant behavior
Due to lack of timely and effective constraints and
education, some children left behind are regardless of
disciplineandhavedeviantbehavior.Manyleft-behind
children do not follow guardians’ instruction at home,
and have poor moral character in schools, for exam-
ple, non-compliance with rules and regulations, often
having the behavior of being late, absenteeism, tru-
ancy, lying, fights, bullying and so on, some obsessing
with billiard room, Internet bar and game room, and
even hanging out with some bad adults in the society.
1.3
Poor endurance for frustration
In the face of their own discomfort or difficulties, left-
behind children are often confused and overwhelmed,
represented as slow action and weak willpower. Some
children feel life is boring, and some even have the
idea of suicide.
1.4
Lack of leaning ability
Most of “left-behind children” lack of initiative, self-
awareness in studying, and are absent-minded and
careless in coping with trouble. Part of “left-behind
children” develop a new “uselessness of study” the-
ory. Seeing parents who haven’t been to school can
still make money outside, the children in the rural areas
begin to feel “there is no distinction between studying
and not studying.” For them, that “knowledge changes
the fate” is just nonsense.
1.5
Severe inferiority complex
Most children have mind of rivalry and sense of pride,
but as left-behind children have no reliance and pro-
tection because of the absence of parents, compared
with the children with parents around, they prone to
generate severe inferiority complex, and some even
give up on themselves, lose confidence.
203

1.6
Strong psychological dependence
Children left behind are mostly raised by grandpar-
ents who often give their excessive care and protection,
which cause the strong psychological dependence of
children.
1.7
Poor interpersonal skills
When communicating with people, some left-behind
children are timid, asocial and suspicious. When they
are confronted with troubles, they would not tell
classmates, not mention to communicate with the
teacher.
2
REASONS BEHIND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS OF LEFT-BEHIND CHILDREN
Modern psychology suggests that children’s emotional
capability is mainly learned from mother, and social
capability of communicating with people is primarily
learned from father. Therefore, in a family, the axis
composed by both the father and mother is most con-
ducive to the overall and healthy growth of children.
Parents are children’s “first teachers”, and they play
a vital role in their children’s education, emotional
training and growth.
Thegreatestneedforloveofhumanisunconditional
love, that is mothers’ love for their children. Human-
ity’s greatest fear is to be abandoned and forgotten.
The mother’s love is unconditional inclusiveness, and
this unconditional love will make people feel a deep
“sense of security.” Once people have a sense of secu-
rity, feelings of confidence, stability, and free will then
be produced. So, this need for love is the most basic
need of human. In the growing process of children, it is
necessary to listen to them and make them feel under-
stood and accepted.And young people especially need
to be listened to and be understood, because they have
a lot of pressure in life and learning but have nowhere
to express. Moreover, due to the hormonal influence,
their emotions are rather unstable, so that if the par-
ents can keep abreast of them and give care, support
and encouragement, it will certainly be of great help to
them. But parents of left-behind children work outside
throughout the year, rarely can timely and effectively
communicate with their children. When the children
encounter confusion in the growing process, they have
no right person to talk and ask, and various psycho-
logical problems arise because of this chronic lack of
affection and care.
Piaget’s “Cognitive Development Theory” puts for-
ward the theory of moral cognitive development, the
forming process of human morality is from heteron-
omy to autonomy. Heteronomy is not only a necessary
stage, but also a necessary prerequisite to achieve
moral autonomy of inner morality, it does not play
its role naturally, and only through heteronomy train-
ing supported by external coercive power can people
learn to consciously abide by the code of ethics. The
moral behavior development of “left-behind children”
is exactly at the stage of heteronomy, and the absence
of parents and lack of timely and effective restraint
and education from guardians lead to that they do not
know the boundaries of words and deeds, have behav-
ioral deviations, and some do whatever they want, if
there is no one promptly shouting “stop”, they will
continue exploring, and they may test the boundaries
of the law after entering into society.

MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL
HEALTH OF LEFT-BEHIND CHILDREN
3.1
Parents of left-behind children should change
their concepts, and attach importance to the
overall and healthy development of children
Many people believe that as long as enough money
is left to the children, the children can accept higher
education, and this is their responsibility for the child,
and also the value of their hard work. This is a wrong
one-sided concept which is often counterproductive.
For each parent, the obligations and responsibilities
taken for granted are to provide the necessary con-
dition of material life, education and security for
the children, and also to give their children family
warmth, ensuring their healthy development in terms
of emotion, morality, behavior and psychology. So
parents should encourage children to communicate
with their relatives, classmates and teachers, focus on
the emotional exchange and psychological communi-
cation with children, and make children understand
and respect themselves by sharing the experience of
working, to help children form a correct view of
life. In addition to telephone contact, parents can use
the mode of letters, for experts advocates that writ-
ing letters between parents and children can better
express feelings and opinions. Besides, parents should
always contact with the guardian, urge the guardian
to exercise supervision responsibility; contact regu-
larly with the school, and truly pay attention to the
child’s growth.
3.2
School should pay particular attention to the
mental health of left-behind children
For the left-behind children, the role of school edu-
cation will be greater than that of the other children
in general. A variety of methods should be used to
standardize the daily behavior of children left behind,
to achieve the combination of heteronomy and auton-
omy, which are the key of children education. Let the
left-behind children “learn to be a good person , learn
to deal with matters, learn to learn, learn to live and
learn to care”, which is the ultimate goal of left-behind
children’s education.
Mental health course should be offered by the
school, mental health education seminars should be
regularly organized, and “private message mailbox”
204

should be set to help “left-behind children” solve prob-
lems that they have nobody to talk to, so as to unlock
the “pimple” of mind.
Broadening the forms of education, and carrying
out a variety of extracurricular activities, to create a
goodcampusculture.Schoolscanofferactivityclasses
once a week, focus on “self-study, self-discipline,
self-reliance, self-care,” teach from the contents like
science and technology, reading, working, communi-
cation, art and so on, and correctly guide students
to arrange their leisure time reasonably, to improve
quality of life .
In order to foster a sense of cooperation of left-
behind children and promote interpersonal relation-
ships, they can be allowed to organize their own team
activities. Children can organize into a team according
to their own wishes, interests and hobbies instead of
class, and the activities of this team can be presided
by the one who devise the scheme that is acceptable
to all team members, so that everyone has a chance to
perform and exercise.
Carrying out “I’m perfect” activities. Students
actively enroll in the activities, to demonstrate their
learned skills in extracurricular activities, so as to
develop their self-confidence, and make their depres-
sion and inferiority complex disappeared in the praise
of others.
3.3
Psychological support from volunteers
Strengthening social propaganda and supervision, to
create an atmosphere for a whole society’s care to
“left-behind” children.The media, units, organizations
and individuals should try their best to make efforts
for the “left-behind” children, establish a “committee
of concerning about left-behind children”, appropri-
ately carry out activities for children to make up for
their emptiness after leaving their parents. Cadres
and workers of organs and institutions, village cadres,
capable party members and people from all works of
life in the community can help left-behind children
as a pair according to the principle of “voluntariness
and equality” and through the coordination of “com-
mittee of concerning about left-behind children” or
voluntary claim, and then they become the “surrogate
parent” of left-behind children and fulfill the respon-
sibilities of “surrogate parent”. “Surrogate parent” is
required to, in accordance with the actual situation of
left-behind children, take care of the child carefully,
teach patiently in learning, guide patiently in mental-
ity, and be the insiders of children’s lives, the guider in
learning, the protector of growth. Mobilizing veteran
cadres and senior party members to be out of school
voluntary counselor, to conduct ideological and moral
education of left-behind children.
Rural left-behind children are a phenomenon that
will exist for a fairly long period, and in order to solve
the problem fundamentally, attention and cooperation
from families, schools, communities and government
are required.

ABSTRACT:
As an important means of social construction, social work has been attached great importance
by the party and the government. The relevant policy documents become an important condition and guarantee
to the development of social work. Based on the policy documents of social work, especially the development
of social work of Shenzhen, a summary of the relevant experience of policies’ implementation is presented in
order to provide ideas for the development of social work in other provinces and cities.

INTRODUCTION
China’s economic development becomes rapid since
the implementation of reform. But as an important
task during the period of social transformation, the
situation of social construction is increasingly seri-
ous. Under domestic experience, social work plays
an important role in addressing social problems. In
recent years, the social work began in the country espe-
cially in the Pearl River Delta region . As the forefront
of China’s economic and social development, Shen-
zhen is one of the cities in China’s earlier exploration
of social work. Based on the development of social
work in Shenzhen, we study lessons of policy imple-
mentation, so as to develop other provinces and cities
nationwide and to provide ideas in social work.

RELEVANT POLICY DOCUMENTS
2.1
Relevant policies of the central government
In October 2006, the Sixth Plenary Session of its
Sixteenth Central Committee of Chinese Communist
Party clearly stated, “building great social work per-
sonnel.”Itisfocusedontheconstructionofsocialwork
personnel becomes the basis of social work develop-
ment policy in China. During 2007–2009, policies
for the development of social work in China is to
start. In terms of experimental work, job evaluation,
social collaboration, academic education, and train-
ing of cadres were actively explored and achieved
some success. During 2010 to 2012, China began to
promote the development of social work policy, and
showed it a high degree of attention, multi-sectoral
joint collaboration, and focus on the characteristics of
long-term planning.
Under the guidance of the central policy document,
different countries began to implement the theory and
practice of social work.The representative is Shenzhen
mode.
2.2
The interpretation and implementation of the
central policy in Shenzhen
In the central policy guidance, Shenzhen began to
develop social work as a breakthrough in the pub-
lic administration reform in 2007, it promulgated and
implemented a municipal relevant policy documents,
establishing the social work system with Shenzhen
characteristics. The policy response to the situation of
Shenzhen can be summarized as follows:
First, the common understanding. A delegation led
by the Shenzhen Municipal learned theoretical knowl-
edge, learned from experiences around, the Shenzhen
municipal government agreed that as a kind of institu-
tional arrangement, social work will improve the social
welfare system, and it has an important significance
in the innovation of the social management system.
Second, an innovation system. In order to ensure
the authority of decision-making, and promote the
effectiveness of the work, the establishment of the
Shenzhen municipal government implemented a pro-
cedure of coordinating bodies and strengthening the
system of combining department functions. In 2007,
the Shenzhen Municipal established a new work sys-
tem, which is “catch total sector-led organization,
specifically responsible for civil affairs departments,
actively cooperating with relevant departments.”
207

Lastly, establishing a system. In October 2007, on
the basis of learning the experiences of Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Shanghai, and other places, the Shenzhen
municipal government issued policies such as “Opin-
ions on Strengthening Social Work qualified person-
nel”. As the programmatic document to promote the
development of social work, the policy made institu-
tional arrangements to the social work management
system and the specific operation.
Through the interpretation and implementation of
central policies, Shenzhen formed the social work
development pattern of “the unified leadership of
Partycommittees,governmentguidance,thefolkorga-
nization operation, and broad public participation”,
which has been hailed as the “Shenzhen model”.

SHENZHEN POLICY IMPLEMENTATION
EXPERIENCE
Shenzhen social work related to the implementation
of the central development policy provides a rich and
profound inspiration for other provinces, which is a
milestone in the professional development of social
work in mainland China.
3.1
The party committee and government attention
is the prerequisite
In order to co-ordinate economic and social devel-
opment, the Shenzhen municipal government takes
“people-orientation” as the starting point and ruling
goal and attaches great importance to social work. To
develop social work in China one must get party com-
mittees’ and governments’ attention and support. This
is decided by the characteristics of China’s social and
political system, but also by the phasic requirements
of China’s social work development.
3.2
Fiscal input is the guarantee
The success of Shenzhen’s promotion of the develop-
ment of social work is the due to the huge financial
investment in government purchase of social work
services. The government must seize the opportunity
to vigorously promote the public finance, establish
and improve the “government purchasing social work
service” mechanism.
Through the implementation of a fair bidding sys-
tem,we can attract more social organizations to under-
take public service projects commissioned by the
government.
3.3
The innovation under the central document of
policy is the fundamental
Shenzhen took advantage of the region being adja-
cent to Hong Kong and Macao, following the courage
to reform the traditional, and explored the develop-
ment model which is “under the leadership of the
government and social organizations development”.
“Shenzhen model” is required from the regional devel-
opment reality to realize innovation, which is the
efficient execution of policy.
4
SHENZHEN’S INADEQUATE
IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES
Specific policy implementation exist certain irra-
tionality, hindered the further development of the
localization of social work, mainly reflected in the
following aspects:
4.1
The intensity of policy implementation still
needs to be improved
In policy implementation, the various stakeholders’
roles, responsibilities, and locations are not clear.
Meanwhile, due to the people’s understanding of social
work exist a big gap, resulting in some departments not
respecting the basic concepts and working methods of
social work as well as social work intervention in some
departments.
4.2
Absence of legislation limiting the development
of social work
At present, China has not yet established a dedicated
social work law, especially in the tax incentives and
exemption regime, which have a significant impact
on the resources absorbing of the social work field.
This will result in an effective donation bill not being
issued, thus affecting businesses, foundations, and
other donors’ enthusiasm. In addition, the absence of
law leads to a lack of legal status of social workers,low
salaries ,a lack of social recognition, non-standardized
rewards and punishments assessment, which will hin-
der the process of the construction of social work
personnel.
4.3
Assessment and regulation has not been
effectively incorporated into the social work
assessment
First, the current evaluation is focused on the evalua-
tion results, rather than the process supervision , lead-
ing it difficult to make timely appropriate treatment-
related violations. Second, social service agencies is
short of rewards and penalties, not only lead to the
institutions and social workers’ lack of initiative,but
it is difficult to form the deterrent force because the
penalty is not timely. Furthermore, the government
has yet to establish a supervision system of social
organization, causes more irregularities.
4.4
Mechanism of government purchase of social
services is to be further optimized
In the process of the implementation of government
purchase, there is no detailed purchase criteria, result-
ing in the purchase behaviour itself having a certain
208

degree of randomness, which is detrimental for the
orderly competition and healthy development of social
service agencies. In addition, the ability to raise their
own resources and professional services capabilities
is relatively weak, social service agencies are depen-
dent on the government as the most important source
of funds, so that the formation of social service agen-
cies rely on government funding inertia, weakening
the ability to integrate its own social resources.
5
FURTHER REFORM OF THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY IN
SHENZHEN
Social work is the inevitable outcome of China’s eco-
nomic and social development. In the modern society
it is there to meet the needs of the people, basic ser-
vices, and the means of solving social problems.Thus,
the field of social work should be focused on promot-
ing the social construction. Combined with difficulties
and problems occurring in the development of the
Shenzhen SocialWork experience and implementation
of the development of social work in the implemen-
tation of central policies, we recommend trying the
followingdimensionsfromthedirectionandcontentof
the reform policy implementation in order to achieve
the sound development of social work development.
5.1
Continue to improve the social work
organization system
We should continue to improve the social work orga-
nization system, and further improve the social work
organization system policy by an executive body of
competent authorities, service usage units, service
providers, industry associations, research institutes
and other components of the assessment, giving full
play to their capabilities, strengthening coordination,
and the formation of a work force. Whilst strength-
ening co-ordination between the party and govern-
ment departments, a clear division of responsibilities
between departments is needed, in order to build a
complete system of an effective social work service.
5.2
A sound legal system of social work
We should speed up the legislative process of social
work, standardized processes determine the social
worker job duties, professional title, evaluation, salary,
reward and punishment evaluation, selection, and
recruitment. At the same time, we should formu-
late comprehensive government purchase service
regulations and mechanisms to further regulate the
government purchase service of social work and pub-
lic service. We should improve donation duty-free
concessions law, implement the preferential develop-
ment of tax-free donations, to maximize the mobi-
lization of social forces to participate in social work
services.
5.3
Strengthen the guiding role of regulatory
assessment of social work development
First, we should strengthen the specification, guidance
and supervision, according to the government to pur-
chase a certain proportion of service funds to set up
special evaluation regulation funds. We would bring
the evaluation into social work system, optimize the
social service agencies, the board of supervisors and
other internal governance structures, establish a pub-
lic complaints system, and increase the transparency
and credibility of strong social work service mech-
anism. Second, improve the structure of third-party
professional evaluation mechanisms, the implemen-
tation of a comprehensive assessment of social work
services and social work service performance will be
evaluated based primarily on the results of the audit of
governmentprocurementofservice.Finally,weshould
formulate the behaviour system of social institutions
and social worker.
5.4
Optimization mechanism for government
purchase of social work services
First, the government should set a reasonable policy
purchase objectives of the social work service, reason-
ably determining the government’s financial payment
mechanisms to effectively guide the social service
agencies, in order to ensure their welfare and achieve
proper services. Second, the government need to sci-
entifically establish the criteria of the government pur-
chasing funds. On the basis of criteria, the government
should establish a dynamic adjustment mechanism.
Besides, according to the quality of service of social
work agencies, classifing the government purchasing
social work service funds, in order to achieve healthy
and orderly development of competition.

ABSTRACT:
On the orders of the central government, the policies being successively issued by local govern-
ments about the children of migrant workers could take the examination locally. Meanwhile, there have been
heated debates in society. This paper, from the perspective of education justice, analyses the problem of migrant
students taking college entrance exams in cities, evaluates the existing the questions, highlights the relevant
policies promulgated by the government over the years, and compares them with each other to present some
problems that need to be addressed. In so doing it puts forward the countermeasures of perfecting the system.

INTRODUCTION
Since the restoration of college entrance examinations
in 1978, the college entrance examination system has
been accompanied by an equal and fair value concept,
and it is under continuous innovation and develop-
ment. With the development of society’s economy,
the rural surplus labour force has been flowing into
the cities in recent years. The number of the chil-
dren of migrants is increasing, the problem of their
education has become a social problem and an educa-
tional conundrum. The reform of the national college
entrance examination system is becoming a hot topic
in the field of education. After years of research and
exploration, the migrant students taking the college
entrance exam in cities policy of China has finally
been put into action, many provinces have already
launched the policies, such as Henan, Hebei, Liaon-
ing, Jilin, Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, Xinjiang, etc.
These policies appear to have solved the immediate
problems, but behind the policies, the true justice prob-
lem have not been addressed. This paper, from the
perspective of education justice, evaluates the exist-
ing migrant students taking college entrance exams in
cities system, in order to promote further reform to
achieve relative fairness.
2
THE FAIR PRESENT SITUATION
Following the principles of equality and fairness, our
migrant students taking the college entrance exams in
cities system has passed through a succession of devel-
opments and has realized the transformation from
theories to practice. Some eliminate the barrier about
the household registration restrictions on education
fairness,andensuretheeducationrightsofthechildren
of migrant workers, show the equity and justice of col-
lege entrance examination. But we have to admit that
in our current system there still exist some unfair and
unjust problems, which would have a bad influence on
society.
2.1
The migrant students sitting the college
entrance exams in cities policies are unfair in
different regions
The ministry of education cannot solve the problem
on their own anyway. This issue needs collaborative
efforts of all social parties. In the face of practical
problems, the ministry of education will have to pro-
mote the migrant students taking the college entrance
exams in cities system. With years of reform, the
government followed the principles of fairness and
efficiency. Along with the ministry of education pro-
gressively liberalizing rights, it not only has brought
vitality into the state and society, but it has also
reduced a lot of responsibility of the central gov-
ernment. The ministry of education asks the local
government to issue new college entrance examination
policies which adapt to circumstances. But without a
clear guiding reform plan, it just places the awful bur-
den on local governments, which is unfair on the local
governments.
211

2.2
The starting point of the migrant students
sitting the college entrance examination system
is not fair
The migrant students taking college entrance exams
in cities policies are mainly targeted at the migrant
children which don’t have a local household regis-
tration. The policies shown that children of migrant
workers can enter senior high schools and take col-
lege entrance exams locally if certain conditions are
met: their parents must have a steady job, a stable
household, a steady revenue, should pay all sorts of
insurance, and should be permanent residents. Stu-
dents must have gone to school locally, and have a
school roll at least one year, etc. Under this assump-
tion of differences between cities and the countryside
and between different regions, the local governments
set access conditions for children wishing to sit college
entrance exams. This has a certain objective rational-
ity. But the migrant students taking college entrance
exams in cities policies tried to promote more edu-
cational equality, the conditions cannot be too hard.
In fact, the migrant students taking college entrance
exams in cities policies by the local governments are
clearly unfair.
2.3
The unfair distribution of the migrant students
sitting college entrance exams in cities policies
After the local government implemented policies,
admissions and resources will be reallocated. And as
things stand for now, some provinces have been clearly
definedthatadmissionscriteriaaboutmigrantchildren
are the same as local candidates, but other provinces
haven’t defined this. If the migrant students recruited
by the local university, it will have impact on the exist-
ing local recruiting resources, and this is unfair for the
local candidates. If the migrant students recruited by
the household school,it will cannot get effective rank-
ing due to the examination papers are different, thus
influence the examinee admission, and this is not fair
to the candidates from other places.
No matter how different college entrance exami-
nation policy design is, it will trigger a new unfair
phenomenon . Children of migrant workers to sit col-
lege entrance exams locally policy must achieve, these
newunfairphenomenonbothtotheuniversityentrance
examination system poses a challenge.

THE PATH TO REFORMING AND
PERFECTING THE SYSTEM
Rawls in his theory of justice said, “justice is the
primary value of society... Some laws and systems,
regardless of how they are efficient and orderly, as long
as they are not just, must be reformed and abolished.” 1
1 John Rawls. A theory of justice China [M]. Beijing: Social
Science Press, 1988.1
The essence of the different college entrance examina-
tions should embody justice, the core value should be
fair. Based on the idea of fairness and justice, we put
forward three aspects of thinking on China’s different
college entrance examinations reform.
3.1
To ensure a fair starting point for off-site
college entrance examinations
Education equality is a citizen’s right regardless of
nationality, race, sex, occupation, property status or
religious belief. Once there is a guarantee of a fair
starting point, then children of migrant workers to sit
college entrance exams locally policy may be effec-
tively achieve a settlement in migrant workers in the
education of their children.
First, establish the values of fairness and justice
reform. Education equity is the foundation of social
justice, college entrance examinations reform must
establish a fair and just value first. Only by fol-
lowing the fair rules, all sectors of society will be
realize the positive interaction. Fairness and justice
is the that social interest relationship are properly
coordinated and internal conflicts and other contra-
dictions are dealt with properly. Only fairness and
justice of the children of migrant workers to sit col-
legeentranceexamslocallypolicy,itwillbecoordinate
the relationship between outflow and inflow of inter-
est to the population, and will be promote reform and
development.
Second,establishalong-termenrolmentmechanism.
China’s open remote college entrance examinations,
are an essential requirement of achieving educational
equity, but are made by the different provinces, these
reform ideas within the existing framework of the col-
lege entrance examination system is flawed. This idea
in the influx of a small, highly competitive college
entrance examination populous is feasible, but for Bei-
jing, Shanghai and other places, is not effective. The
“national college entrance exam migrant”, is leaving
the low enrolment rate of domicile to the admission
of non-domicile to take the exam, the only driving
force is the difference in the provinces enrolment tar-
gets. Root cause of these things is that our college
enrolment management at the provincial implemen-
tation of the quota system. The implementation of
off-site college entrance examinations needs to break
the original provincial enrolment system and estab-
lish long-term enrolment mechanisms. To break the
provincial planned centralized admission system, once
the national key university enrolment targets are no
longer allocated to the provinces, then the conditions
for the entrance to bind household college entrance
examinationsystemwilllosethemeaningofexistence,
this may be a driving force to promote college entrance
examination reform.
Lastly, reform the household registration system.
On the one hand, the household registration system to
confirm citizenship had been unable to adapt to current
growth trends of population flows. The realization of
different college entrance examinations, must be under
212

the environment of the joint college entrance exami-
nation system reform and the household registration
system reform, thus realize the equality of education.
On the other hand, remote college entrance examina-
tion is not only solve the education issues, but also
social issues.As the implementation of policy reforms,
related policies need to be synchronized in order to
realize the value of the policy.
3.2
Remote college entrance examination to ensure
a fair process
Off-site college entrance examination is the starting
point for the fair value reflected in policy making,
but the fair process is the core implementation. There-
fore, to ensure the process fairness to different college
entrance examination policy, in order to make the chil-
dren of migrant workers benefit from the policy, in
order to effectively solve different problems of the
floating population in the entrance examination.
First, the establishment of scientific “access con-
ditions”. The offsite college entrance examination
system is to address children or to take the exam in
the non-household system, thus setting the conditions
should be set around students.. Children of migrant
workers to sit college entrance exams locally policy for
parents conditions need to be improved in two aspects.
On the one hand, parents should weaken the social
background conditions affecting their children to take
the exam. On the other hand, we should set a “con-
trolled” standard, the “stable house”, “stable job” are
no uniform standards to measure, it can be changed to
require parents with “stable income.” Because a steady
source of income means a candidate’s parents have a
stable job and a roof over their heads.
Second, strengthen the control of central govern-
ment. The Chinese Communist Party’s 18th Congress
makes this clear: fairness and justice are inherent
requests in building socialism with Chinese character-
istics. It is the responsibility of the central government
to maintain social equity and justice, and to provide
equal education opportunities. For “Migrant Students
sitting college entrance exams in cities” reform at any
onetime,theprotagonistiscentralgovernmentreform.
To promote the “off-site entrance” reform, to achieve
true educational equity, the central government should
be led by local governments to strengthen monitoring
and evaluation of off-site entrance policy implemen-
tation, and continuous reform and improve relevant
policies and systems.
3.3
To ensure the equality of results
As a solution to the problem, the migrant students sit-
ting college entrance exams in cities policies must be
feasible, the policies could be the key to the problem.
First, ensure fair admission. After publication of
the college entrance examination policy, we could see
that less than half of those policies have set admis-
sions criteria. To solve this problem, the policies must
set admissions criteria that the migrant children are
the same as local candidates, so that policies can be
implemented effectively.
Second, the implementation of compensation for
the weak. After the local government implemented
policies, the import places’ interest become the focus
of general attention. And ignore the outflow places of
examinee’s interests. Whether the success or failure
of the policies will hardly affected they participate in
college entrance examination, but there may violate
their rights and interestsl. So act on fair principle, we
should make up for the lack outflow places.
ThemigrantStudentssittingcollegeentranceexams
in cities system is improving, the scientific policies
and the government’s push are necessary to realize
the migrant students sitting college entrance exams
in cities. Multiple stakeholders are involved, society’s
public resources will be reallocated; this is an issue
that needs collaborative efforts of all social parties.
We should therefore follow the principles of equality
and fair, to set policies and allocate resources, solve the
education of a transient population, supply and perfect
the college entrance examination system, to further
guarantee the right of citizens to receive education.

A study of the personalized physical education teaching of sports courses
Lan Yu
Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China
ABSTRACT:
A yearly Physical Education (PE) sport teaching arrangement, which includes various teaching
units, is designed towards the objectives of skill learning and physical quality promotion. Considering the
difference among individual students, a personalized PE sport teaching plan is formulated for each student. At
the same time, correspondent teaching modes, methods, and organizing forms are discussed.
In a physical education (PE) sport teaching class, the
interests, physical qualities and skill levels of different
students are distinct.The uniform teaching plan, teach-
ing mode, teaching method, and organizing form are
not suitable [1,2]. Therefore, a personalized teaching
planbasedonthecharacteristicsofeachstudentshould
be formulated to maximize the teaching effectiveness,
and proper teaching mode, method, and organizing
form should be adopted [3–7].
1
PERSONALIZED PE SPORT TEACHING
PLAN
Figure 1 presents the unit component of the personal-
ized teaching plan, and Table 1 gives a thirty-six hours
example of yearly teaching plan.
Next contents of all units are introduced.
1.1
Theory unit
There are two sub-units in the theory unit.
(1) Sub-unit 1: including exercise and health, sports
history, theory of skill and tactics, exercise safety,
Figure 1.
Constitution of teaching plan.
exercise prescription theory, and the relation
between physical quality and sports.
(2) Sub-unit 2: competition rules, design and evalu-
ation of exercise plans, formulation and evalua-
tion of exercise prescription, relationship between
exercise and profession, nutrition and health care.
1.2
Experience unit
Experience unit includes three modules: (1) Games
related to a specific PE optional course; (2) Skill show;
(3) Exercise experience of different physical qualities.
1.3
Skill unit
There are two sub-units, named junior and senior sub-
units. A personalized skill exercise plan, which is
determined by the current skill and physical quality
levels of a certain student, is carried out in this unit.
As we all know, most skills of a specific sport often
have several learning tips. For example, shooting is one
of the basic basketball skills. There are many patterns
of shooting: free throw, long shot, fadeaway, and pull
shot etc.The difficulties and the effectiveness for phys-
ical quality promotion of these shooting patterns are
different.Therefore, shooting skills could be divided in
details. Students with poor foundation are required to

learn junior shooting patterns and students with certain
level foundation can learn senior patterns.
In addition, different exercise forms could be used
to meet distinct physical quality requirements of dif-
ferent students. Take shooting as the example again,
we may arrange standing shoot, multiple spots shoot-
ing, and half-court shooting and full-court shooting
to meet different endurance and strength promotion
requirements.
However, since a specific sport has its preferred
physical quality, the effectiveness of skill unit for phys-
ical quality promotion is limited. The physical quality
unit is designed to further promote the physical quality.
1.4
Physical quality unit
Similar to the skill unit, the physical quality unit is
divided into two sub-units: one is called physical qual-
ity promotion sub-unit and the other is called physical
quality strengthening sub-unit. The exercise plan in
the physical quality unit is also designed for an indi-
vidual. Objectives of physical quality unit include: (1)
Learn the theory of exercise prescription. (2) Make
up the difference between the skill teaching plan and
physical quality promotion requirements.
1.5
Competition unit
Competition unit teaches students how to apply their
skills and tactics through teaching matches. It has two
phases: one is performed before the physical qual-
ity strengthening sub-unit and the other is performed
after the physical quality strengthening sub-unit. The
other objective of the competition unit is to let students
experience the pleasures of matches.
1.6
Evaluation unit
Evaluation contents include physical quality, skill,
and theory. In the skill module, basic skills are
more important. Physical qualities include endurance,
strength, and flexibility. Theory evaluation includes
basic theory, theory of PE sport, and theory of exercise
prescription.

PERSONALIZED PE SPORT TEACHING
MODE
2.1
Experience unit
There are three teaching modules in the experience
unit: sport games, skill show, and exercise experience.
The relationship among the three modules is described
in Figure 2.That is to say, the skill show is implicit and
arranged in the sport games module so that students
will not have burdens.The exercise experience module
is arranged after the sport games module.
The sport games module includes three phases:
preparation, execution, and conclusion. In the prepa-
ration phase, the teacher is responsible for explaining
Figure 2.
Relationship among three modules.
the rules of games and arranging group division. In
the execution phase, two or three activities which can
show students’ skill level are arranged and executed
during the game.The teacher should be responsible for
arrangement and paying attention to the enthusiasm of
students. In the conclusion module, the teacher must
illustrate the relationship between games and the spe-
cific sport to improve the learning interest of students.
The relationship between sport skill and physical qual-
ity is also required to illustrate and impel students to
take part in exercise.
The exercise experience module aims at the pro-
motion of endurance, strength, and flexibility. At least
one to two exercise methods for each physical quality
should be introduced. The objectives of this mod-
ule include: (1) Make students realize the importance
of the three physical qualities. (2) Learn the differ-
ence among the three physical qualities. (3) Learn
the distinct effectiveness of different exercise meth-
ods. (4) Understand the theory of exercise prescription
further, which includes exercise item, strength, dura-
tion, and frequency. In this module, the teacher should
emphasize exercise safety.
2.2
Skill unit
The basis of the skill unit teaching is skill learning law,
exercise prescription theory, and the promotion of skill
and tactic exercises for physical quality.
The teacher should divide the students into several
groups. Students in each group often have similar skill
exercise plans.
The unit is divided into two phases: one is a skill
learning phase and the other is an integrated exercise
phase. The former phase has several lessons for differ-
ent skills. Each lesson has two links: one is uniform
learning and the other is personalized exercise. In the
personalized exercise link, each student has their own
exercise form to meet their physical quality promotion
requirements.
2.3
Physical quality unit
The basis of the physical quality unit teaching includes
the physical quality level of a student, teaching plan
of the skill unit, and exercise prescription theory.
The teaching process of the physical quality unit
is divided into three phases. The first is a prepara-
tion phase in which the teacher should explain the
teaching objective, execution mode, and notices. The
second is an execution phase in which the students
exercise personally and the teacher must pay attention
to the status of each student so that he can help the
216

student solve emerging problem.The third is a conclu-
sion phase in which the students discuss their feelings
first and the teacher then draws conclusions. During
the whole process of the unit, the teacher must guide
the students’ action according to the physical quality
promotion plan.
2.4
Competition unit
Different match forms should be designed in this unit.
The task of the first sub-unit is combat exercises.
The procedures include illustration, competition, con-
clusion, competition again, and conclusion again etc.
After multiple matches and conclusions, the skill and
tactic levels of students could be improved, and the

ABSTRACT:
Problem-based learning is the learning and teaching mode. The paper introduces the PBL teach-
ing mode and it’s application in hydraulics. PBL can reform the classroom teaching mode, encourage teachers’
classroom changes, and is helpful for students to construct new knowledge. It resolves the lack of traditional
teaching mode. The paper takes the cohesion and energy dissipation of downstream drainage buildings as an
example, this fully demonstrates the application of PBL teaching mode in hydraulics teaching, it also provides
food for thought for other courses on the reform of water resources and hydropower engineering.
Keywords:
Hydraulics; teaching mode reform; PBL teaching mode
1
INTRODUCTION
Hydraulics is an important professional foundation
course in the water conservancy specialties of water
resources and hydropower engineering, hydrology and
water resources engineering, and agricultural water
conservancy engineering. The hydraulics content is
complex and huge which consists of water statics,
fluid movement of the beam theory, energy dissipa-
tion of downstream drainage buildings, seepage, and
high speed water flow. On the one hand, it involves
many calculations of building of water conservancy
projects, the application of many theories and formula,
and a lot of half experience and half theory formula.
On the other hand, PBL haves clear engineering point,
the energy dissipation of downstream drainage build-
ings, seepage, high speed water flow, etc all can be
used it to solve the practical problems.
At present, the hydraulics courses mainly adopt the
traditional teaching method, such as classroom teach-
ing, laboratory experiments, and the combination of
multimedia and blackboard. The traditional teaching
method is based on the textbook content, teachers
are always positioned at the centre of organizations,
and they organize and monitor the whole process of
teaching activities, while students can only passively
accept, digest and understand the content. For the tra-
ditional teaching method, students don’t search the
course content which is related to the literature and
engineering case beforehand, when the actual prob-
lems appear, they have no idea what to do, so it is
difficult for them to adapt to the needs of the devel-
opment of the university education system, and their
innovative spirit and practice ability is difficult to put
to use.
What kind of teaching method can be used to
improve the applied scientific research innovation
ability of students in institutions of higher educa-
tion? The diversified teaching method reformation
is reported in literature from domestic and overseas
institutions, however these methods cannot change the
dominant role of the teacher and the passive role of stu-
dentsinteaching.Asforthelearningteachingmode,its
kernel is to place the learners at the centre, the learners
are the main body of information gathering, process-
ing, and knowledge of autonomous refactoring instead
of passively accepting state of external stimulus.
The role of the teachers is transformed from that of a
person imparting knowledge to that of the organizers,
helpers, and promoters of a student’s learning process,
maximizing a student’s enthusiasm, initiative, and
ultimately inspiring learners’ creativity. This method
whichintegratethePBLteachingideahasbeenapplied
to the hydraulics teaching reform attempts in the
class of 2010 students in our school, the education
reformation achieved a very good result.

CONNOTATIONS OF THE PBL
TEACHING MODE
In 1969 the United States professor of neurology
HowardBarrows at McMaster University in Canada
founded the PBL teaching mode, as a kind of brand-
new teaching mode, which was based on the construc-
tivism learning theory. Dewey’s pragmatism education
theory and Bruner’s discovery learning theory. The
kernel of PBL is case teaching, it takes the student
as the main body, and teacher as the leader. We can
appreciate from B. Hs and Y.B. Du’s literatures.
219

2.1
The definition of PBL
PBL takes a set of unique and interrelated tasks
as the prerequisite, by efficiently using the existing
resources, the goals of particular efforts are achieved;
it is also a method which uses a variety of resources
to solve the multiple tasks associated with each other
problems. PBL gains a more complete and specific
knowledge by the practice experience, internalizes
absorption, explores innovation, forms the special
skills, and makes the learning process more fully.
We can appreciate these information from J.F. Liu’s
literature.
2.2
The components of PBL
PBL mainly consists of four elements, that is the
content, the activity, the situation, and the result.
J.F. Liu’s and Q. Feng’s literatures are described. The
content is a series of complex, non-predictive and
multidisciplinary problems.
The activity refers to an action of inquiry where stu-
dents make use of certain technical tools and research
methods to solve the problem. In fact, it actually gives
students a close connection with the process of the
real work of a learning experience, allowing students
to construct and generate their own knowledge, at the
same time, forming the corresponding work ability or
skill.
The situation refers to an environment where stu-
dents carry out an exploration; it can be a physical
entity learning environment, a virtual environment.
The result refers to a work which is formed by the
studentsthroughtheinquiryactivity,itcanbesoftware,
a plan, or a conclusion, etc.
2.3
The characteristics of PBL
Characteristics of PBL mainly have five aspects. We
can appreciate these information from Z.W. Ai’s and
L.X. Wen’s literatures.
(1) The real and specific learning situation.
(2) Comprehensive and open learning content.
(3) Diverse and collaborative learning way.
(4) Digital and networked learning methods.
(5) Diversity and effective of learning mode to the
evaluation of students.

THE APPLICATION OF PBL IN
HYDRAULICS TEACHING—TAKING “THE
COHESION AND ENERGY DISSIPATION OF
DOWNSTREAM DRAINAGE BUILDINGS”
AS THE TEACHING EXAMPLE
According to the situation of the water conser-
vancy engineering laboratory, PBL learning mode in
hydraulics is as follows: the study should be closed
to the students’ learning content, the practical prob-
lems in engineering design and innovation of science
and technology to establish the learning program.
Under the guidance of teachers, the students should be
divided into study groups based on the characteristics
ofthestudents.Atthesametime,teachersshouldguide
students towards completing the project and exploring
the method to solve the problem. On the basis of the
connotation of the PBL teaching mode, combined with
the actual situation of the curriculum of hydraulics, the
PBL teaching is as follows: design project →the divi-
sion of groups →make a plan →collaborative inquiry
→report the demo →conclusion and evaluation.
3.1
Designing projects and establishing the
situation
The design project is a very important link, the ratio-
nality of the project directly determines the success
or failure of the follow-up teaching activities. Accord-
ing to the nature, training objective, the properties of
hydraulic factors such as social needs and the char-
acteristics of students of the hydraulics course, the
teacherscanletthestudentsdowhattheyreallyneedby
taking the design of a hydraulic engineering problem
as a starting point. For example, teachers design the
projects and create the problem situation: “the cohe-
sion and energy dissipation of downstream drainage
buildings”. The questions can be what is the water?
How much is the unit weight of water energy under
the case of the building dam? Why is the width of
the drainage buildings smaller than the original river,
what results will it produce? How much energy should
be eliminated in unit width bed every second? How
to connect to the downstream river channel which is
down from upstream of the water? etc?These problems
are the real situations which are always encountered
in the design of water conservancy projects. The stu-
dents’ attention and enthusiasm can thus be attracted
and maintained.
3.2
Dividing the groups and determining the tasks
In order to fully mobilize students’ learning motiva-
tion, teachers should divide the whole class students
into groups and make sure each group has 5–7 people
based on each student’s interests and hobbies, business
ability, professional competence, etc. Finally, we can
assign respective tasks.
There ware 42 people in the excellence of grade
2010 of water resources and hydropower engineering
class, in the project of “the cohesion and energy dissi-
pation of downstream drainage buildings”, we divided
the class into 6 groups according to the actual situ-
ation, and each group had 7 people. A captain for
every group who is responsible for coordinating the
team’s entire tasks, and a recorder for every group
who is responsible for all the problems and solution
of the project. One people responsible for comput-
ing, three people responsible for modeling, testing, and
the production of the relevant model, one person for
reporting production, demonstration, interaction, and
presentation.
220

3.3
Planning and analysing the problem
In order to better explore the activity, teachers should
fully respect the group opinion in planning. So it is
important to note your role transformation and playing
a good supporting role and avoiding too much inter-
vention. By team group discussion, the framework
is built up to solve the problem, listing the detailed
work plan and forecasting possible difficulties, solv-
ing the problem of the implementation of the plan,
implementing the personnel and the completion time
in the scheme, and ensuring the project is completed
on schedule.
In the project of “the cohesion and energy dissipa-
tion of downstream drainage buildings”, students can
put forward a series of problems, such as how to calcu-
late the discharge energy size, how do you determine
the contraction section depth, and how to use the com-
puter to visually show the output. At the same time,
Excel calculation and Matlab programming method is
considered to solve the problems.
3.4
Collaborative inquiry and problem solving
In the inquiry activity, team members should always
aim at project goals, collaboration, taking advantage
of access to information resources and technical tools,
collecting relevant data and selecting, processing the
useful information, and sharing resources between
team members.They also should construct new knowl-
edge on the basis of discussion, such as: the cause
of the upstream channel siltation, the causes and the
prophylactic measures of downstream river channel
scour, the optimization of engineering problems.Team
members use their spare time and holidays to carry out
the project, including: collecting information, process-
ing information, field visits, numerical calculation and
model simulation and model testing, etc. In project
inquiry, students may experience many technical and
life problems, once they encounter problems, they may
be in an irritable mood, and even have the idea of giv-
ing up the project. At this stage, teachers should pay
attention to guide students, on the one hand, to pre-
vent the project deviating from the topic, on the other
hand, to encourage students and help students build up
self-confidence.
In the discussion of the “the cohesion and
energy dissipation of downstream drainage buildings”
project, we mainly divide the contents into three parts
thatisthebasictheory,numericalcalculationandphys-
ical model. Every part is equipped with an instructor.
In the weekend and the students’ free time, teachers
should instruct the students by turns. We can also put
a project weekly meeting system in place according to
the needs of the project, because that can facilitate the
timely communication between teachers and students.
3.5
Demonstration report and results
After finishing the project, the whole class should get
together and engage in a group discussion.
In the inquiry of “the cohesion and energy dissipa-
tion of downstream drainage buildings” project, stu-
dents’achievement reports mainly include three parts:
1) the form of the report, each team presents the whole
research process of the project, as well as the problems
encountered in the study of and the measures to solve
theproblems;2)basedonthelaboratoryplatform,each
group summarizes phenomena which appeared in the
process of testing, and the reasons for their occurrence;
3) based on the computer workstation, teams show
their numerical calculations and visualization of the
entire project implementation process.
3.6
Summary evaluation
Through the self-assessment and mutual reporting
between each group, teachers and students should
summarize their topic.
In the inquiry of “the cohesion and energy dis-
sipation of downstream drainage buildings” project,
through summarizing and exchanging between the
students, the design content of this part can be well
understood. Method such as the high order implicit
algorithm, iterative method, numerical method, such
as hydrolysis can also be well mastered. At the same
time, combining Excel, Visual Basic and Matlab with
professional design can also inspire the students’
enthusiasm and extend the students’ knowledge.

CONCLUSION
It is necessary for students to gasp the correspond-
ing knowledge of the hydraulics. In this paper, the
PBL teaching mode is introduced into the teaching
of hydraulics to make up for the disadvantages of the
traditional teaching mode. Because the PBL teaching
mode is different from the traditional mode, it pays
attention to the performance of the students learning
process and embodies the guiding role of the teacher
and the students as leading actors. There are practical
projects throughout the course of the learning process
which can effectively stimulate the students’ intrin-
sic motivation. This teaching model can also provide
students with decision-making opportunities accord-
ing to their own interest, so that the students can
carry on the study and explore independently, thereby,
students’ autonomous learning ability and innovation
ability can be effectively promoted. By this refor-
mation, students’ knowledge analysis ability and the
ability to solve practical engineering problems have
been significantly improved, that is in accordance with
the high quality water engineering applied technolog-
ical talents ‘cultivation according to the outstanding
engineers training plan for the needs of social and
economic development.

INTRODUCTION
With the industrial automation speedily developed, the
Variable-frequency Drive (VFD) is widely used in all
types of motor-driven making control more and more
flexible and energy efficient [1].
There are two ways to drive a motor by the VFD:
external terminal control or communicational control.
The first way uses an external relay sequence circuit
or PLC output terminals to achieve the VFD stop-
forward-reverse and other operating modes [2]. The
second uses communication to achieve VFD control.
An external sequencer circuit control has poor relia-
bility and a low intelligence level. Using this method,
it is difficult to achieve human-computer interaction
and it has other shortcomings. A VFD that is con-
trolled by the PLC is very common, but the cost can
seem pretty high. In addition, a human-computer inter-
face and an optional encoder are standard modules,
which further increase the cost. Designing the VFD
controller with a microcontroller is cheaper and the
controller can easily be expanded to include mod-
ules such as human-computer interaction and other
intelligent features.
This paper develops a new type of VFD controller
basedonaMemobusRemoteTerminalUnit(RTU)and
a ds-PIC30F6010A.A Memobus RTU communication
protocol is achieved between a dsPIC30F6010A and
an A1000 VFD which are produced by Yaskawa. The
experiment results shows that this controller transports
data reliably and runs stably. The control method and
technology are worthy of using abroad.

MEMOBUS RTU COMMUNICATION
PROTOCOL
The Memobus RTU communication protocol uses a
master-slave response communication. In this commu-
nication protocol, the initiating communication device
is called the communication master (main station)The
device which receiving Communication requests and
make the appropriate response called the communi-
cation slave (slave station). The entire communication
networkallowsonlyonemasterstation.Themastersta-
tion communicates with only one slave station at the
same time. Master communication data packets con-
taintheslaveaddress,theslavecommandtoquerytheir
own information and respond by identifying address.
Memobus RTU communicate data in RTU model.
Compared with the ASCII mode, the RTU mode has
continuous data transmission, high byte transmission
efficiency, and is more suitable for real-time transmis-
sion of data, which is necessary in automation and
control systems.

THE HARDWARE CIRCUIT DESIGN
3.1
Overall design diagram
Figure 1 shows the overall block diagram of the VFD
controller which is developed with dsPIC3-0F6010A.
The controller includes an RS232 bus interface,
RS422/485 bus interface, SPI bus interface, quadra-
ture encoder interface, 8 digital inputs and 8 digital

outputs. The powerful controller can easily communi-
cate with the common human-computer interface via
RS232 and it supports Memobus RTU communica-
tion via an RS422/485 bus interface. The quadrature
encoder feedback motor speed to the controller. In
addition, eight digital inputs can achieve external con-
trol buttons or trip switch control, an eight-way switch
output can directly drive contactors action.
3.2
Host controller
As can be seen from the overall design diagram,
dsPIC30F6010A is the core of the whole system.
dsPIC30F6010A is a 16 fixed-point digital signal con-
troller chip (DSC) which was launched by Microchip.
The high speed operational ability of the DSP
and MCU control capabilities is combined in the ds-
PIC30F6010A with a high anti-jamming capability.
The maximum operating speed is up to 30 MIPS. A
high-performance Reduced Instruction Set Comput-
ing (RISC) Central Processing Unit (CPU) core and a
modified Harvard architecture reduce the difficulty of
development.
An enhanced instruction set of a special C compiler
optimization strongly supports DSP. Large-capacity
memory is integrated in this DSC, including 144kByte
ROM/FLASH, 8kByte SRAM and 4kByte data EEP-
ROM [3]. An integrated motor control Pulse-width
Modulation (PWM)module has four pairs of PWM
output pins which can be set to a variety of operating
modes. An integrated optical encoder interface makes
motor control applications easy.
3.3
RS422 circuit
The VFD A1000’s Memobus RTU electrical standards
meet the standard of the RS422 bus. Compared with
RS232, the RS422 drive is stronger due to its high

input impedance of the receiver and its transmitter
driver; RS422’s differential form of transmission sig-
nal [4] makes its anti-interference good. Figure 2
shows the RS422 driver circuit, SP490E is a low-power
differential transceiver which meets the RS-485 and
RS-422 electrical standards, data transfer rates is up to
10Mbps. dsPIC30F6010A UART1 transmit data sig-
nals U1TX_P is converted to RS422 differential signal
RXD- and RXD + via SP490E, RXD- and RXD +
connect to the A1000 receiving terminal; A1000’s dif-
ferential data transmission terminal TXD + and TXD-
is converted to single-ended data signal U1RX_P via
SP490E. Communication between the controller and
the VFD uses DB9 connectors.
3.4
Quadrature encoder circuit
The Quadrature Encoder Interface (QEI) is internally
integrated in the dsPIC30F6010A. To improve the
electromagnetic compatibility and encoder pulse sig-
nal transmission reliability, a hysteretic comparator
circuit and optical isolation circuit are designed.A dual
voltage comparator LM2903 with peripheral circuit
structures achieves the hysteretic comparator.An opti-
cal coupler 6N137 makes the signal isolated electrical.
The signal is treated by the hysteretic comparator and
optical isolation connected to the quadrature encoder
interface (QEI) of the dsPIC30F6010A. Figure 3
shows the encoder output signal which is processed
by the hysteretic comparator circuit.
3.5
Electric reliability design
The electromagnetic work environment of the VFD is
complex. In order to improve overall system reliability
and anti-jamming performance, the data transmission
path between the microcontroller and theVFD such as
the RS232, RS422/485 interface and the quadrature
encoder interface is electrically isolated by an optical
coupler. The I/O output circuit uses relays to achieve

electrical isolation. The AS is shown in Figure 4, the
optical coupler chip 6N137 is a high-speed optical
coupler, its conversion rate is up to 10 MBit/s, with a
temperature, current and voltage compensation func-
tion, isolation voltage is up to 2.5 kV. One end of the
optical coupler is powered by an inboard power sup-
ply VDD_5V, the other end is supplied by the DC-DC
power modules [5].

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEMOBUS RTU
PROTOCOL SOFTWARE
4.1
A1000 VFD master-slave communication
requirements
The Memobus RTU’s communication between the
controller and the VFD A1000 is done by way of a
master and slave protocol. The VFD as a slave sta-
tion launches communication with the master station
is time-sensitive, after receiving the information from
the master station, it is not allowed to send the same
kind of instruction information to the same slave sta-
tion for some time, otherwise the drive will generate a
communication error and an overshoot alarm will be
raised. The specific waiting time varies depending on
the different commands, the minimum waiting time
of the read operation instruction and monitoring set-
ting is 5 ms, written arguments need 50 ms, written by
determining the change of command parameters need
3–5s [6].
4.2
A1000 Memobus RTU protocol data format
Figure 4 gives the Yaskawa A1000’s Memobus RTU
data communication formats. A data frame is com-
posed of four data segments: slave station address,
function code, data, and error detection (CRC). The
VFD slave address is from 0 to 31, by setting the sta-
tion address register between 0 to FF, when setting the
slave address to 0, the master transmits data to all slave
stations in a broadcast mode.
A function code is used to distinguish the mas-
ter station command type. The Yaskawa A1000 VFD
has three types of function codes: 03H indicates that
the master reads the contents from the station regis-
ters; 08H, indicates that the loop test Memobus RTU
communications is being performed; 10H, indicates
that the main station would like to write more data to
the register of the slave station.
Figure 5.
Software flow diagram.
The data frame includes a data segment, the slave
register address, and the number of data during the
master reading operation. During the writing regis-
ter operation, the data frame data include the register
address, the number of data, and total amount of bytes
and data segments. A1000 Memobus register is two
bytes long, the high byte of data is sent first and then
the low byte of the data in data transmission.
4.3
Software design
The control system software consists of the main pro-
gram and some ISR. The main program completes
the master controller core clock configuration, IO
pin, timer and UART modules and other peripherals.
Initialization, then open interrupt switch and enters
the main loop in the end. The system uses three
timer interrupts to complete the data transmission and
unpacking work. Timer 1 interrupt period is 200 ms,
the VFD sends a reading register request when a
Timer 1 interrupt occurs. Timer 2 interrupt period is
150 ms, mainly to complete unpacking received data.
Two buffers VFD_REV_BUF and LCM_REV_BUF
are defined. The values of the register returned from
the VFD are stored in VFD_REV_BUF, variable val-
ues and various control commands sent by industrial
serial screen are stored in LCM_REV_BUF. Timer
45 interrupt period is defined as 200 ms, register
data of the VFD that is stored in VFD_REV_BUF
is sent to the industrial serial screen to display every
200 ms. Data communication between the controller
and the VFD uses a dsPIC30F6010A’s UART1 inter-
face, and industrial serial screen communication using
UART2 interface. Data is stored in VFD_REV_BUF
and LCM_REV_BUF by the UART receive interrupt
service program. Figure 5 shows the main program,
TIMER1 interrupt subroutine flow diagram.

EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION
A controller prototype was produced based on
the Memobus RTU protocol and was verified by
experiment.
The experiment results show that data communica-
tion between the controller and theVFD is reliable and
stable.The operating power, current, voltage, and other
parameters can be displayed in an industrial serial port
panel screen. It can also control the VFD such as start-
stop and run reverse by the panel screen. Figure 6 is a
photograph of the controller prototype.

ABSTRACT:
A power transformer is one of the most expensive pieces of equipment in power delivery; it is
therefore important to assess the condition of a transformer. In this paper, a transformer condition assessment
model is proposed based on fuzzy information fusion. First, an index system is established based on part division
of a transformer. A Cauchy membership function is then employed to simulate uncertainty of the transformer
condition. A fuzzy synthetic evidential reasoning method is then proposed to combine the fuzzy information of
the transformer. Finally, case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the model.
Results show that the model can provide useful suggestions relating to transformer maintenance for electric
power companies.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, with power systems’ future orientation
towards ultra-high voltage, large capacity and smart
grids, power equipment is required that is of a higher
level of safety and economic operation. Since a trans-
former is the key piece of equipment in power delivery,
the high costs and the critical nature of transform-
ers make it extremely important to prevent failures
as early as possible [1]. Therefore, obtaining the
accurate condition of a transformer is essential for per-
forming necessary and effective maintenance on the
transformers [2].
Since Dissolve Gas Analyses (DGA) is an effective
tool for fault diagnosis of transformers, genetic pro-
gramming [3] and a support vector machine [4] are
applied to obtain DGA information in order to eval-
uate the power transformer’s condition. Furthermore,
a particle swarm optimization-least squares support
vector [5], a weakening buffer operator and a least
square support vector machine [6] are applied to fore-
cast the power transformer’s condition based on the
DGA. However, these achievements are often limited
intheirrepresentationofthefaultcondition.Infact,the
condition of a transformer is often somewhere between
normal state and faulty state [7]. Therefore, the DGA
method alone is not enough for precisely assessing the
condition of a transformer and it is hard to get accu-
rate results when assessing the transformer condition
[8], [9]. Professor Liao [10] presented a method of
condition assessment for transformers based on fuzzy
evidential theory, offering a novel way of thinking
about transformer condition assessment. However, it
does not include bushing and any accessory of the
transformer in its index system, and it just focuses on
the weight relationship between indexes in the process
of evidence fusion but does not take evidence conflicts
into account.
In order to solve these problems, in this paper,
a new assessment model, based on fuzzy informa-
tion fusion, is developed to assess the condition of
a transformer. Some advantages are obtained such
as the fuzzy synthetic properties and the capabilities
of evidence combination. An assessment index sys-
tem is first established. Both the information of index
weights and the conflict of evidences are taken into
consideration in this study, which can improve the
accuracy rate of the evaluation. The results show that
the proposed approach is practical and effective.

FRAMEWORK FOR TRANSFORMER
CONDITION ASSESSMENT
2.1
Assessment system of transformer condition
According to relevant standards [11], items of a
transformer’s main body, bushing and accessory are

selected as the index system.The parameters of T1 and
T2 are defined as quantitative indices while T3 consists
of qualitative indices. The index system is illustrated
in Figure 1.
As shown in Figure 1, supposing that there are a set
of indices X , X = {x1, . . . , xm, . . . , xM}, and that there
are three parts defined as T = {T1, T2, T3} in the index
system. Unlike T3 andT2, T1 has its own factor level
Y = {Y1, Y2, Y3}, which consists of DGA indices, elec-
trical test indices, and oil test indices. Furthermore,
T, which is called the target layer, is the evaluation
outcome of the transformer’s condition [12].
2.2
Determination of the assessing grade
Generally, it is difficult to compare inferiority degrees
among indices because the index data are in different
orders of magnitude. In order to resolve this problem,
this paper employs Equations (1) and (2) to unify the
dimension of the index values. The unified index val-
ues range within [0, 1], with 0 and 1 representing the
initial state and the final state of insulation deterio-
ration of a transformer respectively. For indices (e.g.
insulation resistance of core) of which big values are
desired, their values of the relative inferiority degree
can be calculated by (1); for others like H2, whose
content are small values, are defined by (2):
where: e0 represents the index’s value given by the
manufacturer of the equipment, namely the normal

value; e1 represents the index’s value when the insula-
tion has seriously deteriorated, namely the cautionary
value; and em is the index’s current value. Following
that, the state of a transformer can be classified into
five levels: good, normal, attentive, poor, and serious,
which can be expressed by a matrix g ={g1, g2, g3,
g4, g5}.

AN INTEGRATED METHOD BASED ON
FUZZY INFORMATION FUSION
3.1
Fuzzy method
According to fuzzy theory, the border of neighbour-
ing assessing grades should be an interval. In order to
obtain the membership degree, a Cauchy membership
function is established on the basis of the relationship
between state and membership degree. The function
and its curve are illustrated in Equation (3) and Figure
2 respectively.
Parameters of the Cauchy membership function are
obtained by experts’ experience: c1 = 0.15, c2 = 0.25,
c3 = 0.35, c4 = 0.45, c5 = 0.55, c6 = 0.65, c7 = 0.75,
c8 = 0.85, b = 8, a = 1/0.058.
3.2
Index level judgment by fuzzy evidential
reasoning
Evidential Reasoning theory has the advantage of
handling problems with fuzziness and uncertainty.
Supposing that all independent possible solutions or
hypotheses of a proposition constitute a finite set ,
 is defined as the frame of discernment of the propo-
sition, and there exists a basic hypothesis Gn, which
fits Gn ⊆. All possible hypotheses of  constitute a
set G = {G1, G2, …, GN}, which is presented by the
power set 2. For example, in this paper, the state of
a transformer is classified into 5 grades. Furthermore,
an extra grade G6 = G() is introduced to reflect the
uncertainty of each grade, and these six grades can be
defined as a frame of discernment.
The effects of various indices are different in the
assessment system: some are notable while others are
weak, therefore different weights may be assigned to
different indices. Indices and factor weights calculated
by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method are
shown in Table 1 [13]. The weights of Main body B1,
Bushing B2 and Accessories B3 are 0.5297, 0.3378,
and 0.1325, respectively.

Considering the weight differences, a revision of
the original assignment value must been done before
combining evidence. The revision equations are given
by (4)–(13):
where wm ={w1, · · · , wM} is a uniform weight vector,
wr is the relative importance of xm and the sum of wm
equals to 1, wK =max {w1, · · · , wM} denotes the most
important index in the index level αm(m =1, …, M)
denotes a belief degree coefficient, and αK is referred
to as a prior coefficient representing the importance of
the role of the most important factor in the assessment.
According to repeated studies, in the index level, αK
can be defined as 0.95. Xm(H) is the original basic
assignment probability of index xm, and xm(H) is the
revised basic assignment probability, naturally, xm()
is the uncertainty of belief assignment [10].
Suppose that con is the measure of partial conflicts
between the two evidences (con=0.5 in this paper),
if 0 < con < 0.5, the classical D-S evidence approach
is available. On the other hand, if 0.5≤con, it denotes
that the conflict of the two evidences is too large, the
D-S approach fails. Rectifications of evidences must
be tackled with the following process:
where conh is the partial conflict between the hth index
evidence and the (h+1)th index evidence.The value of
βh can be calculated by (9). Suppose that the hth index
evidence mh,n(Gn) is combined with the (h+1)th index
evidence mh+1,n(Gn), the rectified evidences of the hth
and the (h+1)th grades are shown as Equations (10)
to (13); the result of the combination is shown in (14):
After combining the index evidence one by one, the
original basic probability assignment of each factor’s
evidence can finally be calculated. After combining
all the factors’evidential information, the total assess-
ment of one part of the transformer is obtained by
Equation (15):
Finally, the D-S evidence decision-making crite-
rion for evaluating condition grades is defined as
Equation (16):
where ms(GN0) =max {ms(Gn)}, Gn ⊆G, n= 1, 2, . . .,
N}; ε is set to be the threshold value based upon
experts’ field experience and standard techniques
(ε=0.04 in this paper). The less the value of ε is,
the more precise and reliable the assessment result
becomes. The assessing grade of the given example
can be judged according to Gn0

CASE STUDY
A 220 kV transformer in an electric power company in
China was used for evaluating the presented approach.
On the basis of the test data, an assessment of the
transformer can be performed. Specifically speak-
ing, for factor layer Y1, the relative inferiority degree
can be represented as follows: {x1 =0, x2 =0.0647,
x3 =0.4586, x4 =0.0584, x5 =0.1600}. The judgment
matrix of the relative inferiority degree, obtained by
(3), of each part is given in Equation (17):
Then, taking Main body T1 as an example, using
X1, the membership degree between the indices and

the grades can be obtained by Equation (3) and the
results are presented in Table 2.
By using the weight information of factors relating
to Main body, an assignment matrix is acquired, as
shown in Equation (18):
The output of the transformer’s condition assessment is
shown in the matrix in Equation (19).After combining
evidences of all three parts, the total condition of the
transformer can be obtained and it is displayed by the
matrix in Equation (20):
Finally, the assessment can be conducted by apply-
ing Equations (15) to (16), obtaining the conclusion
that the transformer is on grade g1, which indicates
that there were no faults in the transformer. Based on
the conclusion, the period of the preliminary test could
be prolonged. Further analyses suggest that the con-
dition of the Main body and the Accessories are very
good, while the Bushing is on the attentive level and its
maintenance and test should therefore be performed
ahead of schedule. Compared with the maintenance
log, this result is reasonable. In fact, as maintenance of
the transformer, only one operation, cleaning of insu-
lation waste on the bottom of oil tank, was carried
out. It can be concluded that the integrated model is
capable of delivering reliable results of a transformer’s
condition assessment.

of transformers’condition based on a transformer
related procedure and experts’ experience.

ABSTRACT:
The tetrahedral grid TEN model is an important data model in 3D Geographical Information
System (GIS). It has the limitation that it describes the dynamic characteristics of geographical things, such as
pollution cloud, ocean and so on. This paper proposes a kind of Spatio-temporal TEN model, which defines
corresponding data organization structure, and storage structure, and algorithm used to generate it. Finally, it
puts forward the railway patrol system, makes a geometrical measurement analysis and dynamic simulation of
a dynamic object by using Clifford algebra.

INTRODUCTION
Geographic information system (GIS) has been widely
applied in many fields, such as geology, oceanogra-
phy, city planning, and environmental monitoring.The
relevant scholars have put forward various 3D GIS
data models such as 3D FDS model, SMM model,
and OO3D model. However, Pilouk proposed irregu-
lar tetrahedron grid (TEN model) about the irregular
boundary objects like the pollution cloud, ocean, geo-
logical structure, metal mine etc. 3D data model
based on TEN has many advantages such as simple
topological relations which are convenient for three
dimensional analysis and display.
At the present, the development of GIS demands
that GIS can effectively support spatial and tempo-
ral integration of expression, modeling and simulation
of the continuous geographical phenomenon[1]. The
original TEN model doesn’t express dynamic charac-
teristics of geographic objects, so the construction of
spatio-temporal TEN model can describe the dynamic
characteristics of geographic objects such as a cloud
of pollution, ocean etc. This paper presents a spatio-
temporalTEN model which defines the corresponding
data organization structure and storage structure, and
The development project of science and technology of
DeZhou No. 2011B12
gives the algorithm for its generation. Finally, it puts
forward the railway patrol system, makes a geometri-
cal measurement analysis and dynamic simulation of
a dynamic object by using Clifford algebra.

TEN MODEL
Spatial point-set TEN[2] is a set of tetrahedra which
are mutually adjacent but non overlapping and sat-
isfy the Delaunay criterion. Each tetrahedron’s vertices
is concentrated nearby four points, the Circumscribed
sphere of the tetrahedron does not contain any point in
point set. TEN which conforms to Delaunay standards
and 3D Voronoi graph is a dual, 3D Voronoi diagram
is space expansion of the 2D Voronoi diagram.If the
space point set is composed of n points, the spatial
point is Corresponding to the n 3D Vorinoi map and
each point is the center of one of 3D Voronoi map[2].
In the 3D GIS, a tetrahedron is the basic element
which describes 3D space objects. Through the subdi-
vision of tetrahedrons, an arbitrary 3D space object is
divided into a series of adjacent but non overlapping
sets of tetrahedrons. The constitution principle of the
TEN model is that node is a boundary of the arc, arc
is a boundary of the triangular and the triangle is a
boundary of the tetrahedral[2].

CLIFFORD ALGEBRA
Clifford algebra is also known as geometric alge-
bra, is an algebra based on the dimension calculation,
the operation rules realized the uniform of scalar
calculation,vector calculation, dimension calculation
and geometric calculation. Clifford algebra consists
mainly of two kinds of operation of an inner prod-
uct and an outer product. The outer product mainly
reflects the mutual construction of the relationship
between different levels of geometric forms. And the
inner product can express the measurement features of
distance, angle etc. For the two vectors A and B, Clif-
ford product can be expressed as ab = a • b + a ∧b.
a • b as the inner product a and b, the results of the
operations is a scalar quantity, a ∧b as the outer prod-
uct, the result is a vector. When a • b = 0, non zero
vector a, b orthogonal; outer product is raising dimen-
sionoperation,andwhena ∧b = 0,a,binparallel.The
outer product operation and inner product operation is
also provided based on two kinds of expressions of
the measurement relationship and the dimension rela-
tionship, which makes the expression of the geometric
object contains the dimension relationship, measure
relation attributes[3].

SPATIO-TEMPORAL TEN MODEL
4.1
Data model based on tetrahedron
The spatio-temporal tetrahedral data model is based
on the space-time tetrahedron as the basic element,
a spatial-temporal tetrahedron consists of four basic
elements:the node of spatio-temporal (Tnode), the
edge of spatio-temporal (Tedge), the face of spatio-
temporal triangle (Ttriangle) and the tetrahedion of
spatio-temporal (Ttetrahedion). You can use a rela-
tional database table to store the relationship among
four basic elememts. The relationship between Tedge
and Tnode is stored by edno table;the relationship
among Ttetrahedron, Ttriangle and Tedge is stored by
tte table.
4.2
Data structure
To make the topological relationship among the geom-
etry objects, in order to make the model better establish
the space body model with a spatial location, topol-
ogy relation and time information, more detailed
data structures must be designed. the tetrahedral data
structure is as the follows:
(1) The data structure of the node.
Struct Tnode{
IntVertexID / / point identification
IntVertype / / type
Float x, y, z / / point coordinate
Float t// time t
TetreVer [n] / / point belongs to the body
TriVer [m] / / point belongs to a triangle
Pointer to a StructVertex * next// point
Edgever [p] / / edge of point
}
(2) The data structurethe of the triangle edge.
Struct TEdge{
IntEdgeID / / boundary identification
IntEdgetype / / edge type
Float t// time t
EdgeVer Va, Vb / / edge at both ends
IntTriNo [2] / / edge adjacency triangle
IntTetraNo [2] / / edge adjacent tetrahedra
}
(3) The data structure of the triangular face.
Struct Ttriangle{
IntTriID / / triangle number
Float t// time t
IntTriTetra [2] / / triangle where the tetrahedron
TriVer [3] / / three vertices of triangle
TriEdge [3] / / three edges of a triangle
}
(4) The data structure of the tetrahedral.
Struct Ttetrahedion{
IntTetraID / / tetrahedral number
Float t// time t
TetraVer[4] / / four tetrahedral vertex
TriTetra[4] / / tetrahedral four triangles
TetraTet [4] / / tetrahedral adjacent tetrahedra
The simple data structure reduces the data redun-
dancy and the occupied space, it is also very good
at maintaining the topological relationship of entities,
which are reflected in the data structure.
4.3
The generation algorithm of the
spatio-temporal TEN model
(1) A set of spatio-temporal data, in addition to the
time dimension, inevitably corresponds to convex
boundary constituted by a triangle[4]. We first find
the point on the convex boundary, then examine
all triangles using Delaunay rule to get all triangle
satisfying Delaunay condition.
(2) For a selected arbitrary triangle in a convex bound-
ary triangulation network, let vertices A, B, C be
the base triangle, rearrange the order of vertices,
in order to normal vector pointing to the inner of
convex boundaries. The triangles is written into
the data structure.
(3) Along the normal vector direction, we find a
point D satisfying Delaunay standards, make the
circumscribed sphere of the ABCD four points
exclude other points of the convex boundary.
(4) Write the tetrahedralABCD, and the time attribute
together, write into the data structure, establish
topological relations, external and makes normal
vector of each triangle pointing to the outer of the
tetrahedral, and the three new triangles is the new
base triangles.
(5) For each base triangle repeat step (2), and (3), form
a new tetrahedron and a new triangle, and write
into the data structure and update topological rela-
tionships. Finally finish the spatio-temporal TEN
model.

DYNAMIC SIMULATION
Clifford algebra has advantages in dynamic geometric
measurement analysis of a moving object[5]. For exam-
ple, in a railway patrol system, patrol personnel hold a
positioning system, we can select the patrol personnel
in four buildings under surveillance, we can analyse
the synchronous geometric measure relation of the the
four buildings and patrol personnel.
(1) A sampling frequency of satellite monitoring vehi-
cle as the interval, transmitsts the inspector’s
current coordinate information immediately.
(2) We construct the synchronous calculation model
of the geometric measure relationship by using
Clifford algebra with a centre point of the moni-
tored person and four buildings that are controlled
as the basic geometric object.
(3) Synchronous computational model based on the
step (2), constructs a synchronous calculation
matrix of the patrol and distance.realize the syn-
chronous calculation and distance between build-
ings and patrol.
(4) We reconstruct the motion process of personnel
monitored by using the relevant data and versor
interpolation operators in Clifford algebra, then
output the related data for visualization.
The simulation analysis of the movement scene
between patrol personnel and four buildings as
follows in Figure 1.
The simulated results reproduce the characteris-
tic parameters of motion of the inspection personnel,
giving the dynamic change between personnel and
building controlled.

CONCLUSION
Clifford geometric algebra has a wide application in
calculus, statistics theory, signal processing, and other
fields. Clifford algebra is an algebra of the dimen-
sion calculation based, the operation rules realized the
uniform of scalar operations, vector calculus, dimen-
sion calculation and geometric operation. Clifford
algebra consists mainly two kinds of operation of an
inner product and an outer product. The outer product
mainly reflects the mutual construction of the relation-
ship between different levels of geometric forms.The
inner product can express the measurement features
of distance, angle etc. This paper presents a spatio-
temporalTEN model which defines the corresponding
data organization structure and storage structure, and
gives the generating algorithm for the model. Finally,
it puts forward the railway patrol system,as an exam-
ple, making a geometry measurement analysis of a
dynamic object by using Clifford algebra and dynamic
simulation.
