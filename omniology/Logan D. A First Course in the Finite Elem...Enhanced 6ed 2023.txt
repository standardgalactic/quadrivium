PREFACE  T O  T H E  S I  E D I T I O N
This edition of A First Course in the Finite Element Method, Enhanced Sixth Edition has 
been adapted to incorporate the International System of Units (Le Système International 
d’Unités or SI) throughout the book.
Le Système International d’Unités
The United States Customary System (USCS) of units uses FPS (foot−pound−second) units 
(also called English or Imperial units). SI units are primarily the units of the MKS (meter−
kilogram−second) system. However, CGS (centimeter−gram−second) units are often accepted 
as SI units, especially in textbooks.
Using SI Units in this Book
In this book, we have used both MKS and CGS units. USCS (U.S. Customary Units) or 
FPS (foot-pound-second) units used in the US Edition of the book have been converted to SI 
units throughout the text and problems. However, in case of data sourced from handbooks, 
government standards, and product manuals, it is not only extremely difficult to convert all 
values to SI, it also encroaches upon the intellectual property of the source. Some data in 
figures, tables, and references, therefore, remains in FPS units. For readers unfamiliar with 
the relationship between the USCS and the SI systems, a conversion table has been provided 
inside the front cover.
To solve problems that require the use of sourced data, the sourced values can be con-
verted from FPS units to SI units just before they are to be used in a calculation. To obtain 
standardized quantities and manufacturers’ data in SI units, readers may contact the appropriate 
government agencies or authorities in their regions.
Instructor Resources
The Instructors’ Solution Manual in SI units is available through your Sales Representative 
or online through the book website at http://login.cengage.com. A digital version of the ISM, 
Lecture Note PowerPoint slides for the SI text, as well as other resources are available for 
instructors registering on the book website.
Feedback from users of this SI Edition will be greatly appreciated and will help us improve 
subsequent editions.

PREFAC E
Features and Approach
The purpose of this enhanced edition is to provide an introductory approach to the finite 
element method that can be understood by both undergraduate and graduate students without 
the usual prerequisites (such as structural analysis and upper level calculus) required by many 
available texts in this area. The book is written primarily as a basic learning tool for the under-
graduate student in civil and mechanical engineering whose main interest is in stress analysis 
and heat transfer, although material on fluid flow in porous media and through hydraulic 
­networks and electrical networks and electrostatics is also included. The concepts are presented 
in sufficiently simple form with numerous example problems logically placed throughout the 
book, so that the book serves as a valuable learning aid for students with other backgrounds, as 
well as for practicing engineers. The text is geared toward those who want to apply the finite 
element method to solve practical physical problems.
General principles are presented for each topic, followed by traditional applications of 
these principles, including longhand solutions, which are in turn followed by computer appli-
cations where relevant. The approach is taken to illustrate concepts used for computer analysis 
of large-scale problems.
The book proceeds from basic to advanced topics and can be suitably used in a two-
course sequence. Topics include basic treatments of (1) simple springs and bars, leading to 
two- and three-dimensional truss analysis; (2) beam bending, leading to plane frame, grid, and 
space frame analysis; (3) elementary plane stress/strain elements, leading to more advanced 
plane stress/strain elements and applications to more complex plane stress/strain analysis; 
(4) axisymmetric stress analysis; (5) isoparametric formulation of the finite element method; 
(6) three-dimensional stress analysis; (7) plate bending analysis; (8) heat transfer and fluid 
mass transport; (9) basic fluid flow through porous media and around solid bodies, ­hydraulic 
networks, electric networks, and electrostatics analysis; (10) thermal stress analysis; and  
(11) time-dependent stress and heat transfer.
Additional features include how to handle inclined or skewed boundary conditions, beam 
element with nodal hinge, the concept of substructure, the patch test, and practical consider-
ations in modeling and interpreting results.
The direct approach, the principle of minimum potential energy, and Galerkin’s residual 
method are introduced at various stages, as required, to develop the equations needed for 
analysis.
Appendices provide material on the following topics: (A) basic matrix algebra used 
throughout the text; (B) solution methods for simultaneous equations; (C) basic theory of elas-
ticity; (D) work-equivalent nodal forces; (E) the principle of virtual work; and (F) ­properties 
of structural steel shapes.

More than 100 solved examples appear throughout the text. Most of these examples are 
solved “longhand” to illustrate the concepts. More than 570 end-of-chapter problems are pro-
vided to reinforce concepts. The answers to many problems are included in the back of the 
book to aid those wanting to verify their work. Those end-of-chapter problems to be solved 
using a computer program are marked with a computer symbol.
Additional Features
Additional features of this edition include updated notation used by most engineering instruc-
tors, chapter objectives at the start of each chapter to help students identify what content is 
most important to focus on and retain summary equations for handy use at the end of each 
chapter, additional information on modeling, and more comparisons of finite element solutions 
to analytical solutions.
New Features
Over 140 new problems for solution have been included, and additional design-type prob-
lems have been added to chapters 3, 5, 7, 11, and 12. Additional real-world applications from 
industry have been added to enhance student understanding and reinforce concepts. New space 
frames, solid-model-type examples, and problems for solution have been added. New examples 
from other fields now demonstrate how students can use the Finite Element Method to solve 
problems in a variety of engineering and mathematical physics areas. As in the 5th edition, 
this edition deliberately leaves out consideration of special purpose computer programs and 
suggests that instructors choose a program they are familiar with to integrate into their finite 
element course.

ing questions. Each question can use any combination of text, mathematical equations and 
formulas, sound, pictures, video, and interactive HTML elements. Numbers, words, phrases, 
graphics, and sound or video files can be randomized so that each student receives a different 
version of the same question. In addition to common question types such as multiple choice, 
fill-in-the-blank, essay, and numerical, you can also incorporate robust answer entry palettes 
(mathPad, chemPad, calcPad, physPad, Graphing Tool) to input and grade symbolic expres-
sions, equations, matrices, and chemical structures using powerful computer algebra systems.
WebAssign Offers Engineering Instructors the Following
•	 The ability to create and edit algorithmic and numerical exercises.
•	 The opportunity to generate randomized iterations of algorithmic and numerical 
exercises. When instructors assign numerical WebAssign homework exercises 
(engineering math exercises), the WebAssign program offers them the ability 
to generate and assign their students differing versions of the same engineering 
math exercise. The computational engine extends beyond and provides the 
luxury of solving for correct solutions/answers.
•	 The ability to create and customize numerical questions, allowing students to 
enter units, use a specific number of significant digits, use a specific number of 
decimal places, respond with a computed answer, or answer within a different 
tolerance value than the default.

Prologue
The finite element method is a numerical method for solving problems of engineering and 
mathematical physics. Typical problem areas of interest in engineering and mathematical 
physics that are solvable by use of the finite element method include structural analysis, heat 
transfer, fluid flow, mass transport, and electromagnetic potential.
For physical systems involving complicated geometries, loadings, and material proper-
ties, it is generally not possible to obtain analytical mathematical solutions to simulate the 
response of the physical system. Analytical solutions are those given by a mathematical 
expression that yields the values of the desired unknown quantities at any location in a body 
(here total structure or physical system of interest) and are thus valid for an infinite number of 
locations in the body. These analytical solutions generally require the solution of ordinary or 
partial differential equations, typically created by engineers, physicists, and mathematicians 
to eliminate the need for the creation and testing of numerous prototype designs, which may 
be quite costly. Because of the complicated geometries, loadings, and material properties, the 
solution to these differential equations is usually not obtainable. Hence, we need to rely on 
numerical methods, such as the finite element method, that can approximate the solution to 
these equations.
The finite element formulation of the problem results in a system of simultaneous algebraic 
equations for solution, rather than requiring the solution of differential equations. These numerical

methods yield approximate values of the unknowns at discrete numbers of points in the contin-
uum. Hence, this process of modeling a body by dividing it into an equivalent system of smaller 
bodies of units (finite elements) interconnected at points common to two or more elements (nodal 
points or nodes) and/or boundary lines and/or surfaces is called discretization. Figure 1–1 shows 
a cross section of a concrete dam and a bicycle wrench, respectively, that illustrate this process 
of discretization, where the dam has been divided into 490 plane triangular elements and the 
wrench has been divided into 254 plane quadrilateral elements. In both models the elements are 
connected at nodes and along inter element boundary lines. In the finite element method, instead 
of solving the problem for the entire body in one operation, we formulate the equations for each 
finite element and then combine them to obtain the solution for the whole body.
Briefly, the solution for structural problems typically refers to determining the displace-
ments at each node and the stresses within each element making up the structure that is sub-
jected to applied loads. In nonstructural problems, the nodal unknowns may, for instance, be 
temperatures or fluid pressures due to thermal or fluid fluxes.
This chapter first presents a brief history of the development of the finite element method. 
You will see from this historical account that the method has become a practical one for 
solving engineering problems only in the past 60 years (paralleling the developments asso-
ciated with the modern high-speed electronic digital computer). This historical account is 
followed by an introduction to matrix notation; then we describe the need for matrix methods 
(as made practical by the development of the modern digital computer) in formulating the 
equations for solution. This section discusses both the role of the digital computer in solving 
the large systems of simultaneous algebraic equations associated with complex problems and 
the development of numerous computer programs based on the finite element method. Next, a 
general description of the steps involved in obtaining a solution to a problem is provided. This 
description includes discussion of the types of elements available for a finite element method 
solution. Various representative applications are then presented to illustrate the capacity of the 
method to solve problems, such as those involving complicated geometries, several different 
materials, and irregular loadings. Chapter 1 also lists some of the advantages of the finite 
element method in solving problems of engineering and mathematical physics. Finally, we 
present numerous features of computer programs based on the finite element method.

1.1  Brief History

		 1.1	
Brief History
This section presents a brief history of the finite element method as applied to both structural 
and nonstructural areas of engineering and to mathematical physics. References cited here are 
intended to augment this short introduction to the historical background.
The modern development of the finite element method began in the 1940s in the field of 
structural engineering with the work by Hrennikoff [1] in 1941 and McHenry [2] in 1943, 
who used a lattice of line (one-dimensional) elements (bars and beams) for the solution of 
stresses in continuous solids. In a paper published in 1943 but not widely recognized for many 
years, Courant [3] proposed setting up the solution of stresses in a variational form. Then he 
introduced piecewise interpolation (or shape) functions over triangular subregions making up 
the whole region as a method to obtain approximate numerical solutions. In 1947 Levy [4] 
developed the flexibility or force method, and in 1953 his work [5] suggested that another 
method (the stiffness or displacement method) could be a promising alternative for use in 
analyzing statically redundant aircraft structures. However, his equations were cumbersome 
to solve by hand, and thus the method became popular only with the advent of the high-speed 
digital computer.
In 1954 Argyris and Kelsey [6, 7] developed matrix structural analysis methods using 
energy principles. This development illustrated the important role that energy principles 
would play in the finite element method.
The first treatment of two-dimensional elements was by Turner et al. [8] in 1956. 
They derived stiffness matrices for truss elements, beam elements, and two-dimensional 
triangular and rectangular elements in plane stress and outlined the procedure commonly 
known as the direct stiffness method for obtaining the total structure stiffness matrix. 
Along with the development of the high-speed digital computer in the early 1950s, the 
work of Turner et al. [8] prompted further development of finite element stiffness equa-
tions expressed in matrix notation. The phrase finite element was introduced by Clough 
[9] in 1960 when both triangular and rectangular elements were used for plane stress 
analysis.
A flat, rectangular-plate bending-element stiffness matrix was developed by Melosh [10] 
in 1961. This was followed by development of the curved-shell bending-element stiffness 
matrix for axisymmetric shells and pressure vessels by Grafton and Strome [11] in 1963.
Extension of the finite element method to three-dimensional problems with the develop-
ment of a tetrahedral stiffness matrix was done by Martin [12] in 1961, by Gallagher et al. [13] 
in 1962, and by Melosh [14] in 1963. Additional three-dimensional elements were studied by 
Argyris [15] in 1964. The special case of axisymmetric solids was considered by Clough and 
Rashid [16] and Wilson [17] in 1965.
Most of the finite element work up to the early 1960s dealt with small strains and small 
displacements, elastic material behavior, and static loadings. However, large deflection and 
thermal analysis were considered by Turner et al. [18] in 1960 and material nonlinearities by 
Gallagher et al. [13] in 1962, whereas buckling problems were initially treated by Gallagher 
and Padlog [19] in 1963. Zienkiewicz et al. [20] extended the method to visco elasticity prob-
lems in 1968.
In 1965 Archer [21] considered dynamic analysis in the development of the consistent-mass 
matrix, which is applicable to analysis of distributed-mass systems such as bars and beams in 
structural analysis.

With Melosh’s [14] realization in 1963 that the finite element method could be set up 
in terms of a variational formulation, it began to be used to solve nonstructural applications. 
Field problems, such as determination of the torsion of a shaft, fluid flow, and heat conduction, 
were solved by Zienkiewicz and Cheung [22] in 1965, Martin [23] in 1968, and Wilson and 
Nickel [24] in 1966.
Further extension of the method was made possible by the adaptation of weighted resid-
ual methods, first by Szabo and Lee [25] in 1969 to derive the previously known elasticity 
equations used in structural analysis and then by Zienkiewicz and Parekh [26] in 1970 for 
transient field problems. It was then recognized that when direct formulations and variational 
formulations are difficult or not possible to use, the method of weighted residuals may at 
times be appropriate. For example, in 1977 Lyness et al. [27] applied the method of weighted 
residuals to the determination of magnetic field.
In 1976, Belytschko [28, 29] considered problems associated with large-displacement 
nonlinear dynamic behavior and improved numerical techniques for solving the resulting sys-
tems of equations. For more on these topics, consult the texts by Belytschko, Liu, Moran [58], 
and Crisfield [61, 62].
A relatively new field of application of the finite element method is that of bioengineering 
[30, 31]. This field is still troubled by such difficulties as nonlinear materials, geometric non-
linearities, and other complexities still being discovered.
From the early 1950s to the present, enormous advances have been made in the appli-
cation of the finite element method to solve complicated engineering problems. Engineers, 
applied mathematicians, and other scientists will undoubtedly continue to develop new appli-
cations. For an extensive bibliography on the finite element method, consult the work of Kard-
estuncer [32], Clough [33], or Noor [57].

Introduction to Matrix Notation
Matrix methods are a necessary tool used in the finite element method for purposes of simpli-
fying the formulation of the element stiffness equations, for purposes of longhand solutions of 
various problems, and, most important, for use in programming the methods for high-speed 
electronic digital computers. Hence matrix notation represents a simple and easy-to-use nota-
tion for writing and solving sets of simultaneous algebraic equations.
Appendix A discusses the significant matrix concepts used throughout the text. We will 
present here only a brief summary of the notation used in this text.
A matrix is a rectangular array of quantities arranged in rows and columns that is 
often used as an aid in expressing and solving a system of algebraic equations. As exam-
ples of matrices that will be described in subsequent chapters, the force components

The subscripts to the right of F identify the node and the direction of force, respectively. For 
instance, F x
1  denotes the force at node 1 applied in the x direction. The x, y, and z displace-
ments at a node are denoted by u, v, and w, respectively. The subscript next to u, v, and w 
denotes the node. For instance, u ,
1  
,
1v  and

w  denote the displacement components in the 
x, y, and z directions, respectively, at node 1. The matrices in Eqs. (1.2.1) are called column 
matrices and have a size of

denote a column matrix. The whole set of force or displacement values in the column matrix 
is simply represented by {F} or {d}.
The more general case of a known rectangular matrix will be indicated by use of the 
bracket notation [ ]. For instance, the element and global structure stiffness matrices [k] and

 and all other nodal 
displacement components equal to zero. We should now have a better understanding of the 
meaning of stiffness influence coefficients.
Subsequent chapters will discuss the element stiffness matrices [k] for various element 
types, such as bars, beams, plane stress, and three-dimensional stress. They will also cover the 
procedure for obtaining the global stiffness matrices [K] for various structures and for solving 
Eq. (1.2.4) for the unknown displacements in matrix {d}.
Using matrix concepts and operations will become routine with practice; they will be 
valuable tools for solving small problems longhand. And matrix methods are crucial to the 
use of the digital computers necessary for solving complicated problems with their associated 
large number of simultaneous equations.
	 1.3	
Role of the Computer
As we have said, until the early 1950s, matrix methods and the associated finite element 
method were not readily adaptable for solving complicated problems. Even though the finite 
element method was being used to describe complicated structures, the resulting large number 
of algebraic equations associated with the finite element method of structural analysis made 
the method extremely difficult and impractical to use. However, with the advent of the com-
puter, the solution of thousands of equations in a matter of minutes became possible.
The first modern-day commercial computer appears to have been the UNIVAC, IBM 701, 
which was developed in the 1950s. This computer was built based on vacuum-tube technology.

Along with the UNIVAC came the punch-card technology whereby programs and data were 
created on punch cards. In the 1960s, transistor-based technology replaced the vacuum-tube 
technology due to the transistor’s reduced cost, weight, and power consumption and its higher 
reliability. From 1969 to the late 1970s, integrated circuit-based technology was being devel-
oped, which greatly enhanced the processing speed of computers, thus making it possible to 
solve larger finite element problems with increased degrees of freedom. From the late 1970s 
into the 1980s, large-scale integration as well as workstations that introduced a windows-type 
graphical interface appeared along with the computer mouse. The first computer mouse 
received a patent on November 17, 1970. Personal computers had now become mass-market 
desktop computers. These developments came during the age of networked computing, which 
brought the Internet and the World Wide Web. In the 1990s the Windows operating system was 
released, making IBM and IBM-compatible PCs more user friendly by integrating a graphical 
user interface into the software.
The development of the computer resulted in the writing of computational programs. 
Numerous special-purpose and general-purpose programs have been written to handle various 
complicated structural (and nonstructural) problems. Programs such as [46–56] illustrate the 
elegance of the finite element method and reinforce understanding of it.
In fact, finite element computer programs now can be solved on single-processor machines, 
such as a single desktop or laptop personal computer (PC) or on a cluster of computer nodes. 
The powerful memories of the PC and the advances in solver programs have made it possible 
to solve problems with over a million unknowns.
To use the computer, the analyst, having defined the finite element model, inputs the 
information into the computer. This information may include the position of the element nodal 
coordinates, the manner in which elements are connected, the material properties of the ele-
ments, the applied loads, boundary conditions, or constraints, and the kind of analysis to be 
performed. The computer then uses this information to generate and solve the equations nec-
essary to carry out the analysis.

General Steps of the Finite Element Method
This section presents the general steps included in a finite element method formulation and 
solution to an engineering problem. We will use these steps as our guide in developing solu-
tions for structural and nonstructural problems in subsequent chapters.
For simplicity’s sake, for the presentation of the steps to follow, we will consider only 
the structural problem. The nonstructural heat-transfer, fluid mechanics, and electrostatics 
problems and their analogies to the structural problem are considered in Chapters 13 and 14.
Typically, for the structural stress-analysis problem, the engineer seeks to determine dis-
placements and stresses throughout the structure, which is in equilibrium and is subjected to 
applied loads. For many structures, it is difficult to determine the distribution of deformation 
using conventional methods, and thus the finite element method is necessarily used.
There are three primary methods that can be used to derive the finite element equations 
of a physical system. These are (1) the direct method or direct equilibrium method for struc-
tural analysis problems, (2) the variational methods consisting of among the subsets energy 
methods and the principle of virtual work, and (3) the weighted residual methods. We briefly 
describe these three primary methods as follows, and more details of each will be described 
later in this section under step 4.

Direct Methods
The direct method, being the simplest and yielding a clear physical insight into the finite ele-
ment method, is recommended in the initial stages of learning the concepts of the finite element 
method. However, the direct method is limited in its application to deriving element stiffness 
matrices for one-dimensional elements involving springs, uniaxial bars, trusses, and beams.
There are two general direct approaches traditionally associated with the finite element 
method as applied to structural mechanics problems. One approach, called the force, or flexi-
bility, method, uses internal forces as the unknowns of the problem. To obtain the governing 
equations, first the equilibrium equations are used. Then necessary additional equations are 
found by introducing compatibility equations. The result is a set of algebraic equations for 
determining the redundant or unknown forces.
The second approach, called the displacement, or stiffness, method, assumes the displace-
ments of the nodes as the unknowns of the problem. For instance, compatibility conditions 
requiring that elements connected at a common node, along a common edge, or on a common 
surface before loading remain connected at that node, edge, or surface after deformation takes 
place are initially satisfied. Then the governing equations are expressed in terms of nodal 
displacements using the equations of equilibrium and an applicable law relating forces to 
displacements.
These two direct approaches result in different unknowns (forces or displacements) in the 
analysis and different matrices associated with their formulations (flexibilities or stiffnesses). 
It has been shown [34] that, for computational purposes, the displacement (or stiffness) 
method is more desirable because its formulation is simpler for most structural analysis prob-
lems. Furthermore, a vast majority of general-purpose finite element programs have incorpo-
rated the displacement formulation for solving structural problems. Consequently, only the 
displacement method will be used throughout this text.
Variational Methods
The variational method is much easier to use for deriving the finite element equations for 
two- and three-dimensional elements than the direct method. However, it requires the existence 
of a functional, that upon minimizing yields the stiffness matrix and related element equations. 
For structural/stress analysis problems, we can use the principle of minimum potential energy 
as the functional, for this principle is a relatively easy physical concept to understand and has 
likely been introduced to the reader in an undergraduate course in basic applied mechanics [35].
It can be used to develop the governing equations for both structural and nonstructural 
problems. The variational method includes a number of principles. One of these principles, 
used extensively throughout this text because it is relatively easy to comprehend and is often 
introduced in basic mechanics courses, is the theorem of minimum potential energy that 
applies to materials behaving in a linear-elastic manner. This theorem is explained and used 
in various sections of the text, such as Section 2.6 for the spring element, Section 3.10 for 
the bar element, Section 4.7 for the beam element, Section 6.2 for the constant strain triangle 
plane stress and plane strain element, Section 9.1 for the axisymmetric element, Section 11.2 
for the three-dimensional solid tetrahedral element, and Section 12.2 for the plate bending 
element. A functional analogous to that used in the theorem of minimum potential energy is 
then employed to develop the finite element equations for the nonstructural problem of heat 
transfer presented in Chapter 13.

1.4  General Steps of the Finite Element Method

Another variational principle often used to derive the governing equations is the prin-
ciple of virtual work. This principle applies more generally to materials that behave in a 
linear-elastic fashion, as well as those that behave in a nonlinear fashion. The principle of 
virtual work is described in Appendix E for those choosing to use it for developing the general 
governing finite element equations that can be applied specifically to bars, beams, and two- 
and three-dimensional solids in either static or dynamic systems.
Weighted Residual Methods
The weighted residual methods [36] allow the finite element method to be applied directly to 
any differential equation without having the existence of a variational principle. Section 3.12 
introduces the Galerkin method (a very well-known residual method) for deriving the bar ele-
ment stiffness matrix and associated element equations. Section 3.13 introduces other residual 
methods for solving the governing differential equation for the axial displacement along a bar.
The finite element method involves modeling the structure using small interconnected 
elements called finite elements. A displacement function is associated with each finite ele-
ment. Every interconnected element is linked, directly or indirectly, to every other element 
through common (or shared) interfaces, including nodes and/or boundary lines and/or sur-
faces. By using known stress/strain properties for the material making up the structure, one 
can determine the behavior of a given node in terms of the properties of every other element in 
the structure. The total set of equations describing the behavior of each node results in a series 
of algebraic equations best expressed in matrix notation.
We now present the steps, along with explanations necessary at this time, used in the 
finite element method formulation and solution of a structural problem. The purpose of setting 
forth these general steps now is to expose you to the procedure generally followed in a finite 
element formulation of a problem. You will easily understand these steps when we illustrate 
them specifically for springs, bars, trusses, beams, plane frames, plane stress, axisymmetric 
stress, three-dimensional stress, plate bending, heat transfer, fluid flow, and electrostatics in 
subsequent chapters. We suggest that you review this section periodically as we develop the 
specific element equations.
Keep in mind that the analyst must make decisions regarding dividing the structure or 
continuum into finite elements and selecting the element type or types to be used in the anal-
ysis (step 1), the kinds of loads to be applied, and the types of boundary conditions or sup-
ports to be applied. The other steps, 2 through 7, are carried out automatically by a computer 
program.
Step 1 Discretize and Select the Element Types
Step 1 involves dividing the body into an equivalent system of finite elements with associ-
ated nodes and choosing the most appropriate element type to model most closely the actual 
physical behavior. The total number of elements used and their variation in size and type 
within a given body are primarily matters of engineering judgment. The elements must be 
made small enough to give usable results and yet large enough to reduce computational effort. 
Small elements (and possibly higher-order elements) are generally desirable where the results 
are changing rapidly, such as where changes in geometry occur; large elements can be used 
where results are relatively constant. We will have more to say about discretization guide-
lines in later chapters, particularly in Chapter 7, where the concept becomes quite significant.

The discretized body or mesh is often created with mesh-generation programs or preprocessor 
programs available to the user.
The choice of elements used in a finite element analysis depends on the physical makeup 
of the body under actual loading conditions and on how close to the actual behavior the 
analyst wants the results to be. Judgment concerning the appropriateness of one-, two-, or 
three-dimensional idealizations is necessary. Moreover, the choice of the most appropriate 
element for a particular problem is one of the major tasks that must be carried out by the 
designer/analyst. Elements that are commonly employed in practice—most of which are con-
sidered in this text—are shown in Figure 1–2.
The primary line elements [Figure 1–2(a)] consist of bar (or truss) and beam elements. 
They have a cross-sectional area but are usually represented by line segments. In general, 
the cross-sectional area within the element can vary, but throughout this text it will be con-
sidered to be constant. These elements are often used to model trusses and frame structures 
(see Figure 1–3 on page 17, for instance). The simplest line element (called a linear ele-
ment) has two nodes, one at each end, although higher-order elements having three nodes 
[Figure 1–2(a)] or more (called quadratic, cubic, etc., elements) also exist. Chapter 10 includes 
discussion of higher-order line elements. The line elements are the simplest of elements to 
consider and will be discussed in Chapters 2 through 5 to illustrate many of the basic concepts 
of the finite element method.
The basic two-dimensional (or plane) elements [Figure 1–2(b)] are loaded by forces in 
their own plane (plane stress or plane strain conditions). They are triangular or quadrilateral 
elements. The simplest two-dimensional elements have corner nodes only (linear elements) 
with straight sides or boundaries (Chapter 6), although there are also higher-order elements, 
typically with midside nodes [Figure 1–2(b)] (called quadratic elements) and curved sides 
(Chapters 8 and 10). The elements can have variable thicknesses throughout or be constant. 
They are often used to model a wide range of engineering problems (see Figures 1–4 and 1–5 
on pages 17 and 18).
The most common three-dimensional elements [Figure 1–2(c)] are tetrahedral and hexa-
hedral (or brick) elements; they are used when it becomes necessary to perform a three-­
dimensional stress analysis. The basic three-dimensional elements (Chapter 11) have corner 
nodes only and straight sides, whereas higher-order elements with midedge nodes (and 
­possible midface nodes) have curved surfaces for their sides [Figure 1–2(c)].
The axisymmetric element [Figure 1–2(d)] is developed by rotating a triangle or quad-
rilateral about a fixed axis located in the plane of the element through 
8
360 . This element 
(described in Chapter 9) can be used when the geometry and loading of the problem are 
axisymmetric.
Step 2 Select a Displacement Function
Step 2 involves choosing a displacement function within each element. The function is 
defined within the element using the nodal values of the element. Linear, quadratic, and cubic 
polynomials are frequently used functions because they are simple to work with in finite 
element formulation. However, trigonometric series can also be used. For a two-dimensional 
element, the displacement function is a function of the coordinates in its plane (say, the x-y 
plane). The functions are expressed in terms of the nodal unknowns (in the two-dimensional

problem, in terms of an x and a y component). The same general displacement function can 
be used repeatedly for each element. Hence the finite element method is one in which a con-
tinuous quantity, such as the displacement throughout the body, is approximated by a discrete 
model composed of a set of piecewise-continuous functions defined within each finite domain 
or finite element.
For the one-dimensional spring and bar elements, the displacement function is a function of 
a single coordinate (say x, along the axis of the spring or bar). For the spring and bar elements one 
can then skip step 2 and go directly to step 3 to derive the element stiffness matrix and equations. 
This will be explicitly demonstrated in Chapters 2 and 3 for the spring and bar, respectively.
Step  3 Define the Strain/Displacement and Stress/Strain Relationships
Strain/displacement and stress/strain relationships are necessary for deriving the equations for 
each finite element. In the case of one-dimensional deformation, say, in the x direction, we 
have strain x
ε  related to displacement u by

(1.4.1)
for small strains. In addition, the stresses must be related to the strains through the stress/
strain law—generally called the constitutive law. The ability to define the material behavior 
accurately is most important in obtaining acceptable results. The simplest of stress/strain laws, 
Hooke’s law, which is often used in stress analysis, is given by

Step 4 Derive the Element Stiffness Matrix and Equations
Initially, the development of element stiffness matrices and element equations was based on the 
concept of stiffness influence coefficients, which presupposes a background in structural analysis. 
We now present alternative methods used in this text that do not require this special background.
Direct Equilibrium Method
According to this method, the stiffness matrix and element equations relating nodal forces 
to nodal displacements are obtained using force equilibrium conditions for a basic element, 
along with force/deformation relationships. Because this method is most easily adaptable to 
line or one-dimensional elements, Chapters 2, 3, and 4 illustrate this method for spring, bar, 
and beam elements, respectively.
Work or Energy Methods
To develop the stiffness matrix and equations for two- and three-dimensional elements, it is 
much easier to apply a work or energy method [35]. The principle of virtual work (using vir-
tual displacements), the principle of minimum potential energy, and Castigliano’s theorem are 
methods frequently used for the purpose of derivation of element equations.

1.4  General Steps of the Finite Element Method
13
The principle of virtual work outlined in Appendix E is applicable for any material behav-
ior, whereas the principle of minimum potential energy and Castigliano’s theorem are appli-
cable only to elastic materials. Furthermore, the principle of virtual work can be used even 
when a potential function does not exist. However, all three principles yield identical element 
equations for linear-elastic materials; thus which method to use for this kind of material in 
structural analysis is largely a matter of convenience and personal preference. We will present 
the principle of minimum potential energy—probably the best known of the three energy 
methods mentioned here—in detail in Chapters 2 and 3, where it will be used to derive the 
spring and bar element equations. We will further generalize the principle and apply it to the 
beam element in Chapter 4 and to the plane stress/strain element in Chapter 6. Thereafter, the 
principle is routinely referred to as the basis for deriving all other stress-analysis stiffness 
matrices and element equations given in Chapters 8, 9, 11, and 12.
For the purpose of extending the finite element method outside the structural stress anal-
ysis field, a functional1  (a function of another function or a function that takes functions as 
its argument) analogous to the one to be used with the principle of minimum potential energy 
is quite useful in deriving the element stiffness matrix and equations (see Chapters 13 and 14 
on heat transfer and fluid flow, respectively). For instance, letting π denote the functional and 
f(x,y) denote a function f of two variables x and y, we then have 
f x y
5 ( ( , ))

function of the function f. A more general form of a functional depending on two independent 
variables u(x,y) and ( , )

Weighted Residuals Methods
The weighted residuals methods are useful for developing the element equations; particularly 
popular is Galerkin’s method. These methods yield the same results as the energy methods 
wherever the energy methods are applicable. They are especially useful when a functional 
such as potential energy is not readily available. The weighted residual methods allow the 
finite element method to be applied directly to any differential equation.
Galerkin’s method, along with the collocation, the least squares, and the subdomain 
weighted residual methods are introduced in Chapter 3. To illustrate each method, they will 
all be used to solve a one-dimensional bar problem for which a known exact solution exists for 
comparison. As the more easily adapted residual method, Galerkin’s method will also be used 
to derive the bar element equations in Chapter 3 and the beam element equations in Chapter 4 
1 Another definition of a functional is as follows: A functional is an integral expression that implicitly contains differential 
equations that describe the problem. A typical functional is of the form I u

where {f} is the vector of element nodal forces, [k] is the element stiffness matrix (normally 
square and symmetric), and {d} is the vector of unknown element nodal degrees of freedom 
or generalized displacements, n. Here generalized displacements may include such quantities 
as actual displacements, slopes, or even curvatures. The matrices in Eq. (1.4.5) will be devel-
oped and described in detail in subsequent chapters for specific element types, such as those 
in Figure 1–2.
Step 5 Assemble the Element Equations to Obtain the Global or Total 
Equations and Introduce Boundary Conditions
In this step the individual element nodal equilibrium equations generated in step 4 are assembled 
into the global nodal equilibrium equations. Section 2.3 illustrates this concept for a two-spring 
assemblage. Another more direct method of superposition (called the direct stiffness method), 
whose basis is nodal force equilibrium, can be used to obtain the global equations for the whole 
structure. This direct method is illustrated in Section 2.4 for a spring assemblage. Implicit in 
the direct stiffness method is the concept of continuity, or compatibility, which requires that the 
structure remain together and that no tears occur anywhere within the structure.

matrix, (for most problems, the global stiffness matrix is square and symmetric) and {d} is now 
the vector of known and unknown structure nodal degrees of freedom or generalized displace-
ments. It can be shown that at this stage, the global stiffness matrix [K] is a singular matrix 
because its determinant is equal to zero. To remove this singularity problem, we must invoke 
certain boundary conditions (or constraints or supports) so that the structure remains in place 
instead of moving as a rigid body. Further details and methods of invoking boundary condi-
tions are given in subsequent chapters. At this time it is sufficient to note that invoking bound-
ary or support conditions results in a modification of the global Eq. (1.4.6). We also emphasize 
that the applied known loads have been accounted for in the global force matrix {F}.

where now n is the structure total number of unknown nodal degrees of freedom. These equa-
tions can be solved for the ds by using an elimination method (such as Gauss’s method) or 
an iterative method (such as the Gauss-Seidel method). These two methods are discussed in 
Appendix B. The ds are called the primary unknowns, because they are the first quantities 
determined using the stiffness (or displacement) finite element method.
Step 7 Solve for the Element Strains and Stresses
For the structural stress-analysis problem, important secondary quantities of strain and stress 
(or moment and shear force) can be obtained because they can be directly expressed in terms 
of the displacements determined in step 6. Typical relationships between strain and displace-
ment and between stress and strain—such as Eqs. (1.4.1) and (1.4.2) for one-dimensional 
stress given in step 3—can be used.
Step 8 Interpret the Results
The final goal is to interpret and analyze the results for use in the design/analysis process. 
Determination of locations in the structure where large deformations and large stresses occur 
is generally important in making design/analysis decisions. Postprocessor computer programs 
help the user to interpret the results by displaying them in graphical form.

Applications of the Finite Element Method
The finite element method can be used to analyze both structural and nonstructural problems. 
Typical structural areas include
	 1.	 Stress analysis, including truss and frame analysis (such as pedestrian walk bridges, high 
rise building frames, and windmill towers), and stress concentration problems, typically 
associated with holes, fillets, or other changes in geometry in a body (such as automotive 
parts, pressures vessels, medical devices, aircraft, and sports equipment)
	 2.	 Buckling, such as in columns, frames, and vessels
	 3.	 Vibration analysis, such as in vibratory equipment
	 4.	 Impact problems, including crash analysis of vehicles, projectile impact, and bodies fall-
ing and impacting objects

Nonstructural problems include
	 1.	 Heat transfer, such as in electronic devices emitting heat as in a personal computer micro-
processor chip, engines, and cooling fins in radiators
	 2.	 Fluid flow, including seepage through porous media (such as water seeping through 
earthen dams), cooling ponds, and in air ventilation systems as used in sports arenas, etc., 
air flow around racing cars, yachting boats, and surfboards, etc.
	 3.	 Distribution of electric or magnetic potential, such as in antennas and transistors
Finally, some biomechanical engineering problems (which may include stress analysis) typ-
ically include analyses of human spine, skull, hip joints, jaw/gum tooth implants, heart, and eye.
We now present some typical applications of the finite element method. These applica-
tions will illustrate the variety, size, and complexity of problems that can be solved using the 
method and the typical discretization process and kinds of elements used.
Figure 1–3 illustrates a control tower for a railroad. The tower is a three-dimensional 
frame comprising a series of beam-type elements. The 48 elements are labeled by the circled 
numbers, whereas the 28 nodes are indicated by the uncircled numbers. Each node has three 
rotation and three displacement components associated with it. The rotations (us) and dis-
placements (u, v, w) are called the degrees of freedom. Because of the loading conditions to 
which the tower structure is subjected, we have used a three-dimensional model.
The finite element method used for this frame enables the designer/analyst quickly to 
obtain displacements and stresses in the tower for typical load cases, as required by design 
codes. Before the development of the finite element method and the computer, even this rela-
tively simple problem took many hours to solve.
The next illustration of the application of the finite element method to problem solving 
is the determination of displacements and stresses in an underground box culvert subjected to 
ground shock loading from a bomb explosion. Figure 1–4 shows the discretized model, which 
included a total of 369 nodes, 40 one-dimensional bar or truss elements used to model the 
steel reinforcement in the box culvert, and 333 plane strain two-dimensional triangular and 
rectangular elements used to model the surrounding soil and concrete box culvert. With an 
assumption of symmetry, only half of the box culvert need be analyzed. This problem requires 
the solution of nearly 700 unknown nodal displacements. It illustrates that different kinds of 
elements (here bar and plane strain) can often be used in one finite element model.
Another problem, that of the hydraulic cylinder rod end shown in Figure 1–5, was mod-
eled by 120 nodes and 297 plane strain triangular elements. Symmetry was also applied to the 
whole rod end so that only half of the rod end had to be analyzed, as shown. The purpose of 
this analysis was to locate areas of high stress concentration in the rod end.
Figure 1–6 shows a chimney stack section that is four form heights high (or a total of 
9.75 m high). In this illustration, 584 beam elements were used to model the vertical and 
horizontal stiffeners making up the formwork, and 252 flat-plate elements were used to model 
the inner wooden form and the concrete shell. Because of the irregular loading pattern on the 
structure, a three-dimensional model was necessary. Displacements and stresses in the con-
crete were of prime concern in this problem.
Figure 1–7 shows the finite element discretized model of a proposed steel die used in a 
plastic film-making process. The irregular geometry and associated potential stress concentra-
tions necessitated use of the finite element method to obtain a reasonable solution. Here 240 
axisymmetric elements were used to model the three-dimensional die.

Figure 1–8 illustrates the use of a three-dimensional solid element to model a swing cast-
ing for a backhoe frame. The three-dimensional hexahedral elements are necessary to model 
the irregularly shaped three-dimensional casting. Two-dimensional models certainly would 
not yield accurate engineering solutions to this problem.

perature distribution in earth subjected to a heat source—a buried pipeline transporting a hot

Finally, the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using finite element analysis has 
recently been used to design ventilation systems, such as in large sports arenas, and to study 
air flow around race cars and around golf balls when suddenly struck by a golf club [63].
These illustrations suggest the kinds of problems that can be solved by the finite element 
method. Additional guidelines concerning modeling techniques will be provided in Chapter 7.

Advantages of the Finite Element Method
As previously mentioned, the finite element method has been applied to numerous problems, 
both structural and nonstructural. This method has a number of advantages over conventional 
approximate methods, such as presented by traditional courses in mechanics of material and 
heat transfer, and for modeling and determining physical quantities, such as displacements, 
stresses, temperatures, pressures, and electric currents that have made it very popular. They 
include the ability to
	 1.	 Model irregularly shaped bodies quite easily
	 2.	 Handle general load conditions without difficulty
	 3.	 Model bodies composed of several different materials because the element equations are 
evaluated individually
	 4.	 Handle unlimited numbers and kinds of boundary conditions
	 5.	 Vary the size of the elements to make it possible to use small elements where necessary

The finite element method of structural analysis enables the designer to detect stress, 
vibration, and thermal problems during the design process and to evaluate design changes 
before the construction of a possible prototype. Thus confidence in the acceptability of the 
prototype is enhanced. Moreover, if used properly, the method can reduce the number of pro-
totypes that need to be built.
Even though the finite element method was initially used for structural analysis, it has 
since been adapted to many other disciplines in engineering and mathematical physics, such 
as fluid flow, heat transfer, electromagnetic potentials, soil mechanics, and acoustics [22–24, 
27, 42–44].

Computer Programs for the Finite Element Method
There are two general computer methods of approach to the solution of problems by the finite 
element method. One is to use large commercial programs, many of which have been con-
figured to run on personal computers (PCs); these general-purpose programs are designed to 
solve many types of problems. The other is to develop many small, special-purpose programs 
to solve specific problems. In this section, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages

of both methods. We will then list some of the available general-purpose programs and discuss 
some of their standard capabilities.
Some advantages of general-purpose programs:
	 1.	 The input is well organized and is developed with user ease in mind. Users do not need 
special knowledge of computer software or hardware. Preprocessors are readily available 
to help create the finite element model.
	 2.	 The programs are large systems that often can solve many types of problems of large or 
small size with the same input format.
	 3.	 Many of the programs can be expanded by adding new modules for new kinds of prob-
lems or new technology. Thus they may be kept current with a minimum of effort.
	 4.	 With the increased storage capacity and computational efficiency of PCs, many 
general-purpose programs can now be run on PCs.
	 5.	 Many of the commercially available programs have become very attractive in price and 
can solve a wide range of problems [45–56].
Some disadvantages of general-purpose programs:
	 1.	 The initial cost of developing general-purpose programs is high.
	 2.	 General-purpose programs are less efficient than special-purpose programs because the 
computer must make many checks for each problem, some of which would not be neces-
sary if a special-purpose program were used.
	 3.	 Many of the programs are proprietary. Hence the user has little access to the logic of the 
program. If a revision must be made, it often has to be done by the developers.
Some advantages of special-purpose programs:
	 1.	 The programs are usually relatively short, with low development costs.
	 2.	 Small computers are able to run the programs.
	 3.	 Additions can be made to the program quickly and at a low cost.
	 4.	 The programs are efficient in solving the problems they were designed to solve.
The major disadvantage of special-purpose programs is their inability to solve different 
classes of problems. Thus one must have as many programs as there are different classes of 
problems to be solved. A list of special-purpose, public-domain finite-element programs is 
given in the website [60].
There are numerous vendors supporting finite element programs, and the interested user 
should carefully consult the vendor before purchasing any software. However, to give you 
an idea about the various commercial personal computer programs now available for solving 
problems by the finite element method, we present a partial list of existing programs.

Standard capabilities of many of the listed programs are provided in the preceding refer-
ences and in Reference [45]. These capabilities include information on
	 1.	 Element types available, such as beam, plane stress, and three-dimensional solid
	 2.	 Type of analysis available, such as static and dynamic
	 3.	 Material behavior, such as linear-elastic and nonlinear
	 4.	 Load types, such as concentrated, distributed, thermal, and displacement (settlement)
	 5.	 Data generation, such as automatic generation of nodes, elements, and restraints (most 
programs have preprocessors to generate the mesh for the model)
	 6.	 Plotting, such as original and deformed geometry and stress and temperature contours 
(most programs have postprocessors to aid in interpreting results in graphical form)
	 7.	 Displacement behavior, such as small and large displacement and buckling

Introduction to the Stiffness 
(Displacement) Method
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Define the stiffness matrix.
■ Derive the stiffness matrix for a spring element.
■ Demonstrate how to assemble stiffness matrices into a global stiffness matrix.
■ Illustrate the concept of direct stiffness method to obtain the global stiffness matrix 
and solve a spring assemblage problem.
■ Describe and apply the different kinds of boundary conditions relevant for spring 
assemblages.
■ Show how the potential energy approach can be used to both derive the stiffness 
matrix for a spring and solve a spring assemblage problem.
Introduction
This chapter introduces some of the basic concepts on which the direct stiffness method is 
founded. The linear spring is introduced first because it provides a simple yet generally instruc-
tive tool to illustrate the basic concepts. We begin with a general definition of the stiffness 
matrix and then consider the derivation of the stiffness matrix for a linear-elastic spring ele-
ment. We next illustrate how to assemble the total stiffness matrix for a structure comprising an 
assemblage of spring elements by using elementary concepts of equilibrium and compatibility. 
We then show how the total stiffness matrix for an assemblage can be obtained by superimpos-
ing the stiffness matrices of the individual elements in a direct manner. The term direct stiffness 
method evolved in reference to this technique.
After establishing the total structure stiffness matrix, we illustrate how to impose bound-
ary conditions—both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous. A complete solution including the 
nodal displacements and reactions is thus obtained. (The determination of internal forces is 
discussed in Chapter 3 in connection with the bar element.)
We then introduce the principle of minimum potential energy, apply it to derive the spring 
element equations, and use it to solve a spring assemblage problem. We will illustrate this 
principle for the simplest of elements (those with small numbers of degrees of freedom) so 
that it will be a more readily understood concept when applied, of necessity, to elements with 
large numbers of degrees of freedom in subsequent chapters.

	 2.1 	 Definition of the Stiffness Matrix
Familiarity with the stiffness matrix is essential to understanding the stiffness method. 
We define the stiffness matrix as follows: For an element, a stiffness matrix [k] is a matrix 
such that
 	
{ }
{ }
5 [ ]
f
k
d 	
(2.1.1)
where [k ] relates nodal displacements {d} to nodal forces { f } of a single element, such as the 
spring shown in Figure 2–1a.
For a continuous medium or structure comprising a series of elements, such as shown for 
the spring assemblage in Figure 2–1b, stiffness matrix [K ] relates global-coordinate (x, y, z) 
nodal displacements {d} to global forces {F} of the whole medium or structure. such that

d 	
(2.1.2)
where [K] represents the stiffness matrix of the whole spring assemblage.
	 2.2 	 Derivation of the Stiffness Matrix  
for a Spring Element
Using the direct equilibrium approach, we will now derive the stiffness matrix for a one-­
dimensional linear spring—that is, a spring that obeys Hooke’s law and resists forces only in 
the direction of the spring. Consider the linear spring element shown in Figure 2–2. Reference 
points 1 and 2 are located at the ends of the element. These reference points are called the nodes 
of the spring element. The local nodal forces are 1f x and 2f x for the spring element associated 
with the local axis x. The local axis acts in the direction of the spring so that we can directly 
measure displacements and forces along the spring. The local nodal displacements are 1u  and 
2
u  for the spring element.
These nodal displacements are called the degrees of freedom at each node. Positive direc-
tions for the forces and displacements at each node are taken in the positive x direction as 
shown from node 1 to node 2 in the figure. The symbol k is called the spring constant or 
stiffness of the spring.

2.2  Derivation of the Stiffness Matrix for a Spring Element 
33
Analogies to actual spring constants arise in numerous engineering problems. In ­Chapter 3, 
we see that a prismatic uniaxial bar has a spring constant 
AE L
/
k 5
, where A represents the 
cross-sectional area of the bar, E is the modulus of elasticity, and L is the bar length. Similarly, 
in Chapter 5, we show that a prismatic circular-cross-section bar in torsion has a spring constant 
JG L
/
k 5
, where J is the polar moment of inertia and G is the shear modulus of the material. 
For one-dimensional heat conduction (Chapter 13), 
/
k
AK
L

5
, where Kxx is the thermal 
conductivity of the material, and for one-dimensional fluid flow through a porous medium 
(Chapter 14), 
/
k
AK
L
xx
5
, where Kxx is the permeability coefficient of the material.
We will then observe that the stiffness method can be applied to nonstructural problems, 
such as heat transfer, fluid flow, and electrical networks, as well as structural problems by sim-
ply applying the proper constitutive law (such as Hooke’s law for structural problems, Fourier’s 
law for heat transfer, Darcy’s law for fluid flow, and Ohm’s law for electrical networks) and a 
conservation principle such as nodal equilibrium or conservation of energy.
We now want to develop a relationship between nodal forces and nodal displacements for 
a spring element. This relationship will be the stiffness matrix. Therefore, we want to relate 
the nodal force matrix to the nodal displacement matrix as follows:

where the element stiffness coefficients kij of the [k] matrix in Eq. (2.2.1) are to be determined. 
Recall from Eqs. (1.2.5) and (1.2.6) that kij represent the force Fi in the ith degree of freedom 
due to a unit displacement dj  in the jth degree of freedom while all other displacements are 
zero. That is, when we let dj

We now use the steps outlined in Section 1.4 to derive the stiffness matrix for the spring 
element. However, for the simple one-dimensional spring element, step 2 (selecting a displace-
ment function) may be skipped using the direct method. In Section 3.2 we describe guidelines 
for selecting displacement functions and then use step 2 throughout the derivations of stiffness 
matrices for beams and two- and three-dimensional elements, as it makes the derivations based 
on the steps to follow much easier to obtain. Because our approach throughout this text is to 
derive various element stiffness matrices and then to illustrate how to solve engineering prob-
lems with the elements, step 1 now involves only selecting the element type.
Step 1 Select the Element Type
Consider the linear spring element (which can be an element in a system of springs) subjected 
to resulting nodal tensile forces T (which may result from the action of adjacent springs) 
directed along the spring axial direction x as shown in Figure 2–3, so as to be in equilibrium. 
The local x axis is directed from node 1 to node 2. We represent the spring by labeling nodes 
at each end and by labeling the element number. The original distance between nodes before 
deformation is denoted by L. The material property (spring constant) of the element is k.

Step 2 Select a Displacement Function
For the simple one-dimensional spring element, Step 2 may be skipped using the direct method. 
In Section 3.2 we describe guidelines for selecting displacement functions and then use step 
2 throughout the derivations of stiffness matrices for beams and two- and three-dimensional 
elements.
Step 3 Define the Strain/Displacement and Stress/Strain Relationships
The tensile forces T produce a total elongation (deformation) d of the spring. The typical 
total elongation of the spring is shown in Figure 2–4. Here 1u  is a negative value because the 
direction of displacement is opposite the positive x direction, whereas 2
u  is a positive value.
The total deformation of the spring is represented by the difference in nodal displacements as

(2.2.2)
For a spring element, we can relate the force in the spring directly to the deformation. 
Therefore, the strain/displacement relationship is not necessary here.
The stress/strain relationship can be expressed in terms of the force/deformation relation-
ship instead as

(2.2.9)
as the stiffness matrix for a linear spring element. Here [k] is called the local stiffness matrix 
for the element. We observe from Eq. (2.2.9) that [k] has the following properties:
1.	
It is symmetric (that is, k
k
ij
ji
5
 for ?
i
j). This is proven by the reciprocal theorem of 
Rayleigh and Betti [4].
2.	
It is square (the number of rows equals the number of columns in [k]) as it relates the same 
number of nodal forces to nodal displacements.
3.	
It is singular. That is, the determinant of [k] is equal to zero, so [k] cannot be inverted.
Step 5  Assemble the Element Equations to Obtain the Global Equations 
and Introduce Boundary Conditions
The global stiffness matrix and global force matrix are assembled using nodal force equilib-
rium equations, force/deformation and compatibility equations from Section 2.3, and the direct 
stiffness method described in Section 2.4. This step applies for structures composed of more 
than one element such that

summation of element matrices but rather denotes that these element matrices must be assem-
bled properly according to the direct stiffness method described in Section 2.4.)
Step 6 Solve for the Nodal Displacements
The displacements are then determined by imposing boundary conditions, such as support 
conditions, and solving a system of equations simultaneously as

Step 7 Solve for the Element Forces
Finally, the element forces are determined by back-substitution, applied to each element, into 
equations similar to Eqs. (2.2.7).
	 2.3 	 Example of a Spring Assemblage
Structures such as trusses, building frames, and bridges comprise basic structural components 
connected together to form the overall structures. To analyze these structures, we must deter-
mine the total structure stiffness matrix for an interconnected system of elements. Before con-
sidering the truss and frame, we will determine the total structure stiffness matrix for a spring 
assemblage by using the force/displacement matrix relationships derived in Section 2.2 for 
the spring element, along with fundamental concepts of nodal equilibrium and compatibility. 
Step 5 will then have been illustrated.
We will consider the specific example of the two-spring assemblage shown in Figure 2–5.* 
This example is general enough to illustrate the direct equilibrium approach for obtaining the 
total stiffness matrix of the spring assemblage. Here we fix node 1 and apply axial forces for 3
F x 
at node 3 and 2
F x at node 2. The stiffnesses of spring elements 1 and 2 are 1k  and 2
k , respectively. 
The nodes of the assemblage have been numbered 1, 3, and 2 for further generalization because 
sequential numbering between elements generally does not occur in large problems.
The x axis is the global axis of the assemblage. The local x axis of each element coincides 
with the global axis of the assemblage.
For element 1, using Eq. (2.2.8), we have

where, throughout this text, the superscripts in parentheses above u refers to the element 
number to which they are related. Recall that the subscript to the right identifies the node of 
displacement and that 3
u  is the node 3 displacement of the total or global spring assemblage.
Free-body diagrams of each element and node (using the established sign conventions for 
element nodal forces in Figure 2–2) are shown in Figure 2–6.
Based on the free-body diagrams of each node shown in Figure 2–6 and the fact that exter-
nal forces must equal internal forces at each node, we can write nodal equilibrium equations 
at nodes 3, 2, and 1 as

is called the total or global or system stiffness matrix.
In summary, to establish the stiffness equations and stiffness matrix, Eqs. (2.3.9) and 
(2.3.11), for a spring assemblage, we have used force/deformation relationships Eqs. (2.3.1) 
and (2.3.2), compatibility relationship Eq. (2.3.3), and nodal force equilibrium Eqs. (2.3.4) 
through (2.3.6). We will consider the complete solution to this example problem after con-
sidering a more practical method of assembling the total stiffness matrix in Section 2.4 and 
discussing the support boundary conditions in Section 2.5.
	 2.4 	 Assembling the Total Stiffness Matrix 
by Superposition (Direct Stiffness Method)
We will now consider a more convenient method for constructing the total stiffness matrix. This 
method is based on proper superposition of the individual element stiffness matrices making 
up a structure (also see References [1] and [2]).
Referring to the two-spring assemblage of Section 2.3, the element stiffness matrices are 
given in Eqs. (2.3.1) and (2.3.2) as

(2.4.1)
Here the uis written above the columns and next to the rows in the [k]s indicate the degrees of 
freedom associated with each element row and column.
The two element stiffness matrices, Eqs. (2.4.1), are not associated with the same degrees 
of freedom; that is, element 1 is associated with axial displacements at nodes 1 and 3, whereas 
element 2 is associated with axial displacements at nodes 2 and 3. Therefore, the element stiff-
ness matrices cannot be added together (superimposed) in their present form. To superimpose 
the element matrices, we must expand them to the order (size) of the total structure (spring 
assemblage) stiffness matrix so that each element stiffness matrix is associated with all the 
degrees of freedom of the structure. To expand each element stiffness matrix to the order of 
the total stiffness matrix, we simply add rows and columns of zeros for those displacements 
not associated with that particular element.

2  |  Introduction to the Stiffness (Displacement) Method
40
The expanded element stiffness matrices in Eqs. (2.4.2) and (2.4.3) could have been added 
directly to obtain the total stiffness matrix of the structure, given in Eq. (2.4.6). This reliable 
method of directly assembling individual element stiffness matrices to form the total structure 
stiffness matrix and the total set of stiffness equations is called the direct stiffness method. It 
is the most important step in the finite element method.
For this simple example, it is easy to expand the element stiffness matrices and then 
superimpose them to arrive at the total stiffness matrix. However, for problems involving a 
large number of degrees of freedom, it will become tedious to expand each element stiffness 
matrix to the order of the total stiffness matrix. To avoid this expansion of each element 
stiffness matrix, we suggest a direct, or shortcut, form of the direct stiffness method to obtain 
the total stiffness matrix. For the spring assemblage example, the rows and columns of each 
element stiffness matrix are labeled according to the degrees of freedom associated with them 
as follows:

Here elements in [K ] are located on the basis that degrees of freedom are ordered in 
increasing node numerical order for the total structure. Section 2.5 addresses the com-
plete solution to the two-spring assemblage in conjunction with discussion of the support 
boundary conditions.
	 2.5 	 Boundary Conditions
We must specify boundary (or support) conditions for structure models such as the spring 
assemblage of Figure 2–5, or [K ] will be singular; that is, the determinant of [K ] will be zero, 
and its inverse will not exist. This means the structural system is unstable. Without our speci-
fying adequate kinematic constraints or support conditions, the structure will be free to move 
as a rigid body and not resist any applied loads. In general, the number of boundary conditions 
necessary to make [K ] nonsingular is equal to the number of possible rigid body modes.

2.5  Boundary Conditions
41
Boundary conditions relevant for spring assemblages are associated with nodal displace-
ments. These conditions are of two types. Homogeneous boundary conditions—the more 
­common—occur at locations that are completely prevented from movement; nonhomogeneous 
boundary conditions occur where finite nonzero values of displacement are specified, such as 
the settlement of a support.
In the mathematical sense in regard to solving boundary value problems, we encounter two 
general classifications of boundary conditions when imposed on an ordinary or partial differ-
ential equation or derived upon taking the first variation of a functional as shown in References 
[4, 5, 8], but these are avoided in this more basic textbook.
The first type—primary, essential, or Dirichlet—boundary condition [named after Johann 
Dirichlet (1805–1859)], specifies the values a solution, such as the displacement, must satisfy 
on the boundary of the domain.
The second type—natural or Neumann—boundary condition [named after Carl Neumann 
(1832–1925)], specifies the values that the derivatives of a solution must satisfy on the bound-
ary of the domain.
To illustrate the two general displacement types of boundary conditions, let us consider 
Eq. (2.4.6), derived for the spring assemblage of Figure 2–5. which has a single rigid body 
mode in the direction of motion along the spring assemblage.
Homogeneous Boundary Conditions
We first consider the case of homogeneous boundary conditions. Hence all boundary conditions 
are such that the displacements are zero at certain nodes. Here we have 
0
1u 5  because node 
1 is fixed. Therefore, Eq. (2.4.6) can be written as

For homogeneous boundary conditions, Eq. (2.5.3) could have been obtained directly by 
deleting the row and column of Eq. (2.5.1) corresponding to the zero-displacement degrees 
of freedom. Here row 1 and column 1 are deleted because one is really multiplying column 1 
of [K] by 
0
1u 5 . However, 1
F x is not necessarily zero and can be determined once 2
u  and 3
u  
are solved for.
After solving Eq. (2.5.3) for 2
u  and 3
u , we have

Therefore, for all homogeneous boundary conditions, we can delete the rows and columns

and then solve for the unknown displacements. This procedure is useful for hand calculations. 
(However, Appendix B.4 presents a more practical, computer-assisted scheme for solving the 
system of simultaneous equations.)
Nonhomogeneous Boundary Conditions
We now consider the case of nonhomogeneous boundary conditions. Hence one or more of 
the specified displacements are nonzero. For simplicity’s sake, let 1u

(2.5.11)
Therefore, when dealing with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions, we cannot initially delete 
row 1 and column 1 of Eq. (2.5.7), corresponding to the nonhomogeneous boundary condi-
tion, as indicated by the resulting Eq. (2.5.11) because we are multiplying each element by 
a nonzero number. Had we done so, the 1k d term in Eq. (2.5.11) would have been neglected, 
resulting in an error in the solution for the displacements. For nonhomogeneous boundary 
conditions, we must, in general, transform the terms associated with the known displacements 
to the right-side force matrix before solving for the unknown nodal displacements. This was 
illustrated by transforming the 1k d term of the second of Eqs. (2.5.9) to the right side of the 
second of Eqs. (2.5.10).
We could now solve for the displacements in Eq. (2.5.11) in a manner similar to that used 
to solve Eq. (2.5.3). However, we will not further pursue the solution of Eq. (2.5.11) because 
no new information is to be gained.
However, on substituting the displacement back into Eq. (2.5.7), the reaction now becomes

Notice that if the displacement is known at a node (say 1u

5 ), then the force 1
F x at the 
node in the same direction as the displacement is not initially known and is determined using 
the global equation of Eq. (2.5.7) after solving for the unknown nodal displacements.

2  |  Introduction to the Stiffness (Displacement) Method
44
At this point, we summarize some properties of the global stiffness matrix in Eq. (2.5.7) 
that are also applicable to the generalization of the finite element method.
	 1.	 [K] is square, as it relates the same number of forces and displacements.
	 2.	 [K] is symmetric, as is each of the element stiffness matrices. If you are familiar with 
structural mechanics, you will not find this symmetry property surprising. It can be proved 
by using the reciprocal laws described in such References as [3] and [4].
	 3.	 [K] is singular (its determinant is equal to zero), and thus, no inverse exists until sufficient 
boundary conditions are imposed to remove the singularity and prevent rigid body motion.
	 4.	 The main diagonal terms of [K] are always positive. Otherwise, a positive nodal force Fi 
could produce a negative displacement di —a behavior contrary to the physical behavior 
of any actual structure.
	 5.	 [K] is positive semidefinite (that is { } [
]{ }
0
x
K
x
T
.
 for all non-zero vector {x} with real 
numbers). (For more about positive semidefinite matrices, see Appendix A.)
In general, specified support conditions are treated mathematically by partitioning the 
global equilibrium equations as follows:

For the spring assemblage with arbitrarily numbered nodes shown in Figure 2–8, obtain 
(a) the global stiffness matrix, (b) the displacements of nodes 3 and 4, (c) the reaction 
forces at nodes 1 and 2, and (d) the forces in each spring. A force of 25 kN is applied 
at node 4 in the x direction. The spring constants are given in the figure. Nodes 1 and 2 
are fixed.

required to displace node 5 by

F x at that same node and in that same direction is not initially

EXAMPLE 2.3
(a) Using the ideas presented in Section 2.3 for the system of linear elastic springs shown 
in Figure 2–13, express the boundary conditions, the compatibility or continuity condi-
tion similar to Eq. (2.3.3), and the nodal equilibrium conditions similar to Eqs. (2.3.4) 
through (2.3.6). Then formulate the global stiffness matrix and equations for solution of 
the unknown global displacement and forces. The spring constants for the elements are  
k1, k2, and k3; P is an applied force at node 2.

tion as in part (a).

Therefore, the global stiffness matrix is the square, symmetric matrix on the right side of 
Eq. (2.5.48). Making use of the boundary conditions, Eqs. (2.5.44), and then considering 
the second equation of Eqs. (2.5.47) or (2.5.48), we solve for 2

previously described in Section 2.4, and then solving for 2

where the particular degrees of freedom associated with each element are listed in the col-

add terms from each element stiffness matrix into the appropriate corresponding row and 
column in the global stiffness matrix to obtain

We observe that each element stiffness matrix [k] has been added into the location in the 
global [K] corresponding to the identical degree of freedom associated with the element 
[k]. For instance, element 3 is associated with degrees of freedom 
2
u  and 4
u ; hence its 
contributions to [K] are in the 2–2, 2–4, 4–2, and 4–4 locations of [K], as indicated in  
Eq. (2.5.52) by the 3
k  terms.
Having assembled the global [K] by the direct stiffness method, we then formulate the 
global equations in the usual manner by making use of the general Eq. (2.3.10), 
[
]{ }
{ } 5
F
K
d . 
These equations have been previously obtained by Eq. (2.5.48) and therefore are not 
repeated.
Another method for handling imposed boundary conditions that allows for either homoge-
neous (zero) or nonhomogeneous (nonzero) prescribed degrees of freedom is called the penalty 
method. This method is easy to implement in a computer program.
Consider the simple spring assemblage in Figure 2–15 subjected to applied forces 1
F x and 
2
F x as shown. Assume the horizontal displacement at node 1 to be forced to be 1
d
5
u
.
We add another spring (often called a boundary element) with a large stiffness kb to the 
assemblage in the direction of the nodal displacement 1
d
5
u
 as shown in Figure 2–16. This 
spring stiffness should have a magnitude about 106 times that of the largest kii term.

In using the penalty method, a very large element stiffness should be parallel to a degree 
of freedom as is the case in the preceding example. If kb were inclined, or were placed within 
a structure, it would contribute to both diagonal and off-diagonal coefficients in the global 
stiffness matrix [K]. This condition can lead to numerical difficulties in solving the equations

	 2.6 	 Potential Energy Approach to Derive Spring 
Element Equations
One of the alternative methods often used to derive the element equations and the stiffness 
matrix for an element is based on the principle of minimum potential energy. (The use of this 
principle in structural mechanics is fully described in Reference [4].) This method has the 
advantage of being more general than the method given in Section 2.2, which involves nodal 
and element equilibrium equations along with the stress/strain law for the element. Thus the 
principle of minimum potential energy is more adaptable to the determination of element 
equations for complicated elements (those with large numbers of degrees of freedom) such as 
the plane stress/strain element, the axisymmetric stress element, the plate bending element, 
and the three-dimensional solid stress element.
Again, we state that the principle of virtual work (Appendix E) is applicable for any 
material behavior, whereas the principle of minimum potential energy is applicable only 
for elastic materials. However, both principles yield the same element equations for linear-­
elastic materials, which are the only kind considered in this text. Moreover, the principle of 
minimum potential energy, being included in the general category of variational methods 
(as is the principle of virtual work), leads to other variational functions (or functionals) 
similar to potential energy that can be formulated for other classes of problems, primarily of 
the nonstructural type. These other problems are generally classified as field problems and 
include, among others, torsion of a bar, heat transfer (Chapter 13), fluid flow (Chapter 14), 
and electric potential (Chapter 14).
Still other classes of problems, for which a variational formulation is not clearly defin-
able, can be formulated by weighted residual methods. We will describe Galerkin’s method 
in Section 3.12, along with collocation, least squares, and the subdomain weighted residual 
methods in Section 3.13. In Section 3.13, we will also demonstrate these methods by solving 
a one-dimensional bar problem using each of the four residual methods and comparing each 
result to an exact solution. (For more information on weighted residual methods, also consult 
References [5–7].)
Here we present the principle of minimum potential energy as used to derive the spring 
element equations. We will illustrate this concept by applying it to the simplest of elements in 
hopes that the reader will then be more comfortable when applying it to handle more compli-
cated element types in subsequent chapters.

The total potential energy π p of a structure is expressed in terms of displacements. 
In the finite element formulation, these will generally be nodal displacements such that

We first state the principle of minimum potential energy as follows:
Of all the geometrically possible shapes that a body can assume, the true one, 
­corresponding to the satisfaction of stable equilibrium of the body, is identified by 
a minimum value of the total potential energy.
To explain this principle, we must first explain the concepts of potential energy and of a 
stationary value of a function. We will now discuss these two concepts.
 Total potential energy is defined as the sum of the internal strain energy U and the 
potential energy of the external forces Ω; that is,
 	
π
Ω
5

U

(2.6.1)
Strain energy is the capacity of internal forces (or stresses) to do work through deformations 
(strains) in the structure; Ω is the capacity of forces such as body forces, surface traction forces, 
and applied nodal forces to do work through deformation of the structure.
To understand the concept of internal strain energy, we first describe the concept of exter-
nal work. In this section, we consider only the external work due to an applied nodal force. In 
Chapter 3, Section 10, we consider work due to body forces (typically self weight) and surface 
tractions (distributed forces). External work is done on a linear-elastic behaving member [here 
we consider an elastic spring shown in Figure 2–17(a)] by applying a gradually increasing 
magnitude force F to the end of the spring up to some maximum value max
F
 less than that which 
would cause permanent deformation in the spring. The maximum deformation 
max
X
 occurs 
when the maximum force occurs as shown in Figure 2–17(b). The external work is given by 
the area under the force-deformation curve shown in Figure 2–17(b), where the slope of the 
straight line is equal to the spring constant k. The external work We is then given from basic 
mechanics principles as the integral of the dot product of vector force F with the differential 
displacement dx. This expression is represented by Eq. (2.6.2) as

The concept of a stationary value of a function G (used in the definition of the principle of 
minimum potential energy) is shown in Figure 2–18. Here G is expressed as a function of the 
variable x. The stationary value can be a maximum, a minimum, or a neutral point of G(x). To 
find a value of x yielding a stationary value of G(x), we use differential calculus to differentiate 
G with respect to x and set the expression equal to zero, as follows:
 	
0
5
dG
dx
	
(2.6.10)
An analogous process will subsequently be used to replace G with πp  and x with discrete 
values (nodal displacements) di. With an understanding of variational calculus (see Reference 
[8]), we could use the first variation of π p (denoted by dπ p, where d denotes arbitrary change 
or variation) to minimize π p. However, we will avoid the details of variational calculus and 
show that we can really use the familiar differential calculus to perform the minimization of 
π p. To apply the principle of minimum potential energy—that is, to minimize π p—we take the 
variation of 
p

where n equations must be solved for the n values of di that define the static equilib-
rium state of the structure. Equation (2.6.12) shows that for our purposes throughout this 
text, we can interpret the variation of π p as a compact notation equivalent to differenti-
ation of π p with respect to the unknown nodal displacements for which π p is expressed. 
For ­linear-elastic materials in equilibrium, the fact that π p is a minimum is shown, for 
instance, in Reference [4].
Before discussing the formulation of the spring element equations, we now illustrate 
the concept of the principle of minimum potential energy by analyzing a single-degree-of-­
freedom spring subjected to an applied force, as given in Example 2.4. In this example, we 
will show that the equilibrium position of the spring corresponds to the minimum potential 
energy.

For the linear-elastic spring subjected to a force of 5000 N shown in Figure 2–20, evaluate 
the potential energy for various displacement values and show that the minimum potential 
energy also corresponds to the equilibrium position of the spring.

We considered the equilibrium of a single spring element by minimizing the total 
potential energy with respect to the nodal displacements (see Example 2.4). We also devel-
oped the finite element spring element equations by minimizing the total potential energy 
with respect to the nodal displacements. We now show that the total potential energy of an 
entire structure (here an assemblage of spring elements) can be minimized with respect to 
each nodal degree of freedom and that this minimization results in the same finite element 
equations used for the solution as those obtained by the direct stiffness method.

Introduction
Having set forth the foundation on which the direct stiffness method is based, we will now 
derive the stiffness matrix for a linear-elastic bar (or truss) element using the general steps 
outlined in Chapter 1. We will include the introduction of both a local coordinate system, 
chosen with the element in mind, and a global or reference coordinate system, chosen to be

convenient (for numerical purposes) with respect to the overall structure. We will also discuss 
the transformation of a vector from the local coordinate system to the global coordinate system, 
using the concept of transformation matrices to express the stiffness matrix of an arbitrarily 
oriented bar element in terms of the global system. We will solve three example plane truss 
problems (see Figure 3–1 for a typical railroad trestle plane truss and a lift bridge truss over the 
Illinois River) to illustrate the procedure of establishing the total stiffness matrix and equations 
for solution of a structure.
Next we extend the stiffness method to include space trusses. We will develop the trans-
formation matrix in three-dimensional space and analyze two space trusses. Then we describe 
the concept of symmetry and its use to reduce the size of a problem and facilitate its solution. 
We will use an example truss problem to illustrate the concept and then describe how to handle 
inclined, or skewed, supports.
We will then use the principle of minimum potential energy and apply it to rederive the 
bar element equations. We then compare a finite element solution to an exact solution for 
a bar subjected to a linear varying distributed load. We will introduce Galerkin’s residual 
method and then apply it to derive the bar element equations. Finally, we will introduce other 
common residual methods—collocation, subdomain, and least squares—to merely expose 
you to them. We illustrate these methods by solving a problem of a bar subjected to a linear 
varying load.
	 3.1 	 Derivation of the Stiffness Matrix for a Bar Element 
in Local Coordinates
We will now consider the derivation of the stiffness matrix for the linear-elastic, constant 
cross-sectional area (prismatic) bar element shown in Figure 3–2. The derivation here will 
be directly applicable to the solution of pin-connected trusses. The bar is subjected to tensile 
forces T directed along the local axis of the bar and applied at nodes 1 and 2.
The bar element is assumed to have constant cross-sectional area A, modulus of elasticity 
E, and initial length L. The nodal degrees of freedom are local axial displacements (longitudinal 
displacements directed along the length of the bar) represented by 1u  and 2
u  at the ends of the 
element as shown in Figure 3–2.
From Hooke’s law [Eq. (3.1.1)] and the strain/displacement relationship [Eq. (3.1.2) or 
Eq. (1.4.1)], we write

where u is the axial displacement function along the element in the x direction and A and E are 
written as though they were functions of x in the general form of the differential equation, even 
though A and E will be assumed constant over the whole length of the bar in our derivations to 
follow.
The following assumptions are used in deriving the bar element stiffness matrix:

The steps previously outlined in Chapter 1 are now used to derive the stiffness matrix for 
the bar element and then to illustrate a complete solution for a bar assemblage.
Step 1 Select the Element Type
Represent the bar by labeling nodes at each end and in general by labeling the element number 
(Figure 3–2).
As in deriving the spring element stiffness matrix, step 2 can be skipped at this time in 
deriving the one-dimensional bar element stiffness matrix. To facilitate the derivation, we can 
proceed directly to step 3

Equation (3.1.14) represents the stiffness matrix for a bar element in local coordinates. 
In Eq. (3.1.14), AE/L for a bar element is analogous to the spring constant k for a spring element.

method described in Chapter 2 (see Section 3.6 for an example truss). This step applies for

	 3.2 	 Selecting a Displacement Function in Step 2  
of the Derivation of Stiffness Matrix for the  
One-Dimensional Bar Element
Consider the following guidelines, as they relate to the one-dimensional bar element, when 
selecting a displacement function. (Further discussion regarding selection of displacement func-
tions and other kinds of approximation functions (such as temperature functions) will be pro-
vided in Chapter 4 for the beam element, in Chapter 6 for the constant-strain triangular element, 
in Chapter 8 for the linear-strain triangular element, in Chapter 9 for the axisymmetric element,

3.2  Selecting a Displacement Function in Step 2 of the Derivation of Stiffness Matrix
in Chapter 10 for the three-noded bar element and the plane quadrilateral element, in Chapter 
11 for the three-dimensional stress element, in Chapter 12 for the plate bending element, and in 
Chapter 13 for the heat transfer problem. More information is also provided in References [1–3].
Guidelines for Selecting Displacement Functions
1. 	We must choose in advance the mathematical function to represent the deformed shape of the 
bar element under loading. Because it is difficult, if not impossible at times, to obtain a closed 
form or exact solution, we assume a solution shape or distribution of displacement within the 
element by using an appropriate mathematical function. The most common functions used are 
polynomials.
Because the bar element resists axial loading only with the local degrees of freedom for 
the element being displacement 1u  and 2
u  along the x direction, we choose a displacement func-
tion u to represent the axial displacement throughout the element. Here a linear displacement 
variation along the x axis of the bar is assumed [Figure 3–4(b)], because a linear function with 
specified endpoints has a unique path. Therefore,

(3.2.1)
In general, the total number of coefficients a is equal to the total number of degrees of freedom 
associated with the element. Here the total number of degrees of freedom is two—an axial 
displacement at each of the two nodes of the element. In matrix form, Eq. (3.2.1) becomes

are called the shape functions because the Ni’s express the shape of the assumed displacement 
function over the domain (x coordinate) of the element when the ith element degree of freedom 
has unit value and all other degrees of freedom are zero. In this case,

 for any axial coordinate along the bar.
The significance of the shape functions summing to one is described more fully under 
Guideline 4. In addition, the Ni’s are often called interpolation functions because we are 
interpolating to find the value of a function between given nodal values. The interpolation 
function may be different from the actual function except at the endpoints or nodes, where the 
interpolating function and actual function must be equal to specified nodal values.
2. 	The approximation function should be continuous within the bar element. The simple linear 
function for u of Eq. (3.2.1) certainly is continuous within the element. Therefore, the linear 
function yields continuous values of u within the element and prevents openings, overlaps, and 
jumps because of the continuous and smooth variation in u (Figure 3–5).

81
3.2  Selecting a Displacement Function in Step 2 of the Derivation of Stiffness Matrix
3. 	The approximating function should provide interelement continuity for all degrees of free-
dom at each node for discrete line elements and along common boundary lines and surfaces 
for two- and three-dimensional elements. For the bar element, we must ensure that nodes 
common to two or more elements remain common to these elements upon deformation and 
thus prevent overlaps or voids between elements. For example, consider the two-bar structure 
shown in Figure 3–5. For the two-bar structure, the linear function for u [Eq. (3.2.1)] within 
each element will ensure that elements 1 and 2 remain connected; the displacement at node 2 
for element 1 will equal the displacement at the same node 2 for element 2; that is, 
5
2
(1)
2
(2)
u
u
. 
This rule was also illustrated by Eq. (2.3.3). The linear function is then called a conforming, or 
compatible, function for the bar element because it ensures the satisfaction both of continuity 
between adjacent elements and of continuity within the element.
In general, the symbol Cm is used to describe the continuity of a piecewise field (such as 
axial displacement), where the superscript m indicates the degree of derivative that is interele-
ment continuous. A field is then 
0
C  continuous if the function itself is interelement continuous. 
For instance, for the field variable being the axial displacement illustrated in Figure 3–5, the dis-
placement is continuous across the common node 2. Hence the displacement field is said to be 
0
C  continuous. Bar elements, plane elements (see Chapter 7), and solid elements (Chapter 11) 
are 
0
C  elements in that they enforce displacement continuity across the common boundaries.
If the function has both its field variable and its first derivative continuous across the 
common boundary, then the field variable is said to be 
1
C  continuous. We will later see that 
the beam (see Chapter 4) and plate (see Chapter 12) elements are 
1
C  continuous. That is, they 
enforce both displacement and slope continuity across common boundaries.
4. 	The approximation function should allow for rigid-body displacement and for a state of 
constant strain within the element. The one-dimensional displacement function [Eq. (3.2.1)] 
satisfies these criteria because the 1a  term allows for rigid-body motion ­(constant motion of the 
body without straining) and the 2
a x term allows for constant strain because «
5
5
2
du dx
a
x
 
is a constant. (This state of constant strain in the element can, in fact, occur if elements are 
chosen small enough.) The simple polynomial Eq. (3.2.1) satisfying this fourth guideline is 
then said to be complete for the bar element.
This idea of completeness also means in general that the lower-order term cannot be omitted 
in favor of the higher-order term. For the simple linear function, this means 1a  cannot be omitted 
while keeping 2
a x. Completeness of a function is a necessary condition for convergence to the 
exact answer, for instance, for displacements and stresses (Figure 3–6) (see Reference [3]). Figure 
3–6 illustrates monotonic convergence toward an exact solution for displacement as the number 
of elements in a finite element solution is increased. Monotonic convergence is then the process in 
which successive approximation solutions (finite element solutions) approach the exact solution 
consistently without changing sign or direction.

The idea that the interpolation (approximation) function must allow for a rigid-body 
­displacement means that the function must be capable of yielding a constant value (say, 1a ), 
because such a value can, in fact, occur. Therefore, we must consider the case

Thus Eq. (3.2.14) shows that the displacement interpolation functions must add to unity at every 
point within the element so that u will yield a constant value when a rigid-body ­displacement 
occurs.

conveniently. Global coordinates are chosen to be convenient for the whole structure.
Given the nodal displacement of an element, represented by the vector d in Figure 3–7, we 
want to relate the components of this vector in one coordinate system to components in another. 
For general purposes, we will assume in this section that d is not coincident with either the local or 
the global axis. In this case, we want to relate global displacement components to local ones. In so 
doing, we will develop a transformation matrix that will subsequently be used to develop the global 
stiffness matrix for a bar element. We define the angle u to be positive when measured counterclock-
wise from x to 9x . We can express vector displacement d in both global and local coordinates by

The matrix [T] is called the transformation (or rotation) matrix. For an additional description 
of this matrix, see Appendix A. It will be used in Section 3.4 to develop the global stiffness 
matrix for an arbitrarily oriented bar element and to transform global nodal displacements and 
forces to local ones.

of displacement appear for the local-coordinate representation of a spring or a bar, as shown 
by Eq. (3.4.1). By using relationships between local and global force components and between 
local and global displacement components, we will be able to obtain the global stiffness matrix.

	 3.6 	 Solution of a Plane Truss
We will now illustrate the use of equations developed in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, along with the 
direct stiffness method of assembling the total stiffness matrix and equations, to solve the fol-
lowing plane truss example problems. A plane truss is a structure composed of bar elements 
that all lie in a common plane and are connected by frictionless pins. The plane truss also must 
have loads acting only in the common plane and all loads must be applied at the nodes or joints.
Example 3.5
For the plane truss composed of the three elements shown in Figure 3–13 subjected to a 
downward force of 50 kN applied at node 1, determine the x and y displacements at node 1 
and the stresses in each element. Let

SOLUTION:
First, we determine the global stiffness matrices for each element by using Eq. (3.4.23). 
This requires determination of the angle u between the global x axis and the local 9x  axis 
for each element. In this example, the direction of the 9x  axis for each element is taken in 
the direction from node 1 to the other node as shown in Figure 3–13. The node numbering is 
arbitrary for each element. However, once the direction is chosen, the angle u is then estab-
lished as positive when measured counterclockwise from positive x to 9x . For element 1, 
the local x91 axis is directed from node 1 to node 2; therefore, u
5
8
90
(1)
. For element 2, the 
local x92 axis is directed from node 1 to node 3 and u
5
8
45
(2)
. For element 3, the local 93
x  
axis is directed from node 1 to node 4 and u
5 8
0
(3)
. It is convenient to construct Table 3–1 
to aid in determining each element stiffness matrix.
There are a total of eight nodal components of displacement, or degrees of ­freedom, 
for the truss before boundary constraints are imposed. Thus the order of the total stiff-
ness matrix must be 3
8
8. We could then expand the [k] matrix for each element to 
the order 3
8
8 by adding rows and columns of zeros as explained in the first part of 
Section 2.4. Alternatively, we could label the rows and columns of each element stiffness 
matrix according to the displacement components associated with it as explained in the 
latter part of Section 2.4. Using this latter approach, we construct the total stiffness 
matrix [K] simply by adding terms from the individual element stiffness matrices into 
their corresponding locations in [K]. This approach will be used here and throughout 
this text.

(3.6.5)
We could now use the partitioning scheme described in the first part of Section 2.5 to obtain 
the equations used to determine unknown displacements 1u  and 1v —that is, ­partition the 
first two equations from the third through the eighth in Eq. (3.6.5). Alternatively, we could 
eliminate rows and columns in the total stiffness matrix corresponding to zero displace-
ments as previously described in the latter part of Section 2.5. Here we will use the latter 
approach; that is, we eliminate rows and column 3–8 in Eq. (3.6.5) because those rows 
and columns correspond to zero displacements. (Remember, this direct approach must be 
modified for nonhomogeneous boundary conditions as was indicated in ­Section 2.5.) We 
then obtain

Equation (3.6.6) can now be solved for the displacements by multiplying both sides of the

The minus sign in the 1v  result indicates that the displacement component in the y direction

Eqs. (3.6.8) and (3.6.10), we obtain the global [K] matrix and relate the global forces to

in Three-Dimensional Space
We will now derive the transformation matrix necessary to obtain the general stiffness matrix of 
a bar element arbitrarily oriented in three-dimensional space as shown in Figure 3–16. Let the 
coordinates of node 1 be taken as 1x , 1y , and 1z , and let those of node 2 be taken as 2
x , 2y , and 2z . 
Also, let ux, uy, and uz be the angles measured from the global x, y, and z axes, respectively, to 
the local 9x  axis. Here 9x  is directed along the element from node 1 to node 2. We must now 
determine [

(3.7.9)
Equation (3.7.9) is the basic form of the stiffness matrix for a bar element arbitrarily 
oriented in three-dimensional space. We will now analyze a simple space truss to illustrate the 
concepts developed in this section. We will show that the direct stiffness method provides a 
simple procedure for solving space truss problems.
Example 3.8
Analyze the space truss shown in Figure 3–17. The truss is composed of four nodes, whose 
coordinates (in millimeters) are shown in the figure, and three elements, whose cross-
sectional areas are given in the figure. The modulus of elasticity 
5
E
8 GPa for all elements. 
A load of 5000 N is applied at node 1 in the negative z direction. Nodes 2–4 are supported 
by ball-and-socket joints and thus constrained from movement in the x, y, and z directions. 
Node 1 is constrained from movement in the y direction by the roller shown in Figure 3–17.

SOLUTION:
Using Eq. (3.7.9), we will now determine the stiffness matrices of the three elements in 
Figure 3–17. To simplify the numerical calculations, we first express [k] for each element, 
given by Eq. (3.7.9), in the form

	 3.8 	 Use of Symmetry in Structures
Different types of symmetry may exist in a structure. These include reflective or mirror, skew, 
axial, and cyclic. Here we introduce the most common type of symmetry, reflective symme-
try. Axial symmetry occurs when a solid of revolution is generated by rotating a plane shape 
about an axis in the plane. These axisymmetric bodies are common, and hence their analysis 
is considered in Chapter 9.
In many instances, we can use reflective symmetry to facilitate the solution of a problem. 
Reflective symmetry means correspondence in size, shape, and position of loads; material 
properties; and boundary conditions that are on opposite sides of a dividing line or plane. 
The use of symmetry allows us to consider a reduced problem instead of the actual problem. 
Thus, the order of the total stiffness matrix and total set of stiffness equations can be reduced. 
Longhand solution time is then reduced, and computer solution time for large-scale problems is 
substantially decreased. Example 3.10 will be used to illustrate reflective symmetry. ­Additional 
examples of the use of symmetry are presented in Chapter 4 for beams and in Chapter 7 for 
plane problems.
Example 3.10
Solve the plane truss problem shown in Figure 3–19. The truss is composed of eight ­elements 
and five nodes as shown. A vertical load of 2P is applied at node 4. Nodes 1 and 5 are pin 
supports. Bar elements 1, 2, 7, and 8 have axial stiffnesses of 2AE, and bars 3–6 have 
axial stiffness of AE. Here again, A and E represent the cross-sectional area and modulus 
of elasticity of a bar.

In this problem, we will use a plane of symmetry. The vertical plane perpendicular to 
the plane truss passing through nodes 2, 4, and 3 is the plane of reflective symmetry because 
identical geometry, material, loading, and boundary conditions occur at the corresponding 
locations on opposite sides of this plane. For loads such as 2P, occurring in the plane of 
symmetry, half of the total load must be applied to the reduced structure. For elements 
occurring in the plane of symmetry, half of the cross-sectional area must be used in the 
reduced structure. Furthermore, for nodes in the plane of symmetry, the displacement com-
ponents normal to the plane of symmetry must be set to zero in the reduced structure; that 
is, we set

, and

. Figure 3–20 shows the reduced structure to be used 
to analyze the plane truss of Figure 3–19.

SOLUTION:
We begin the solution of the problem by determining the angles u for each bar element. 
For instance, for element 1, assuming 9x  to be directed from node 1 to node 2, we obtain 
u
5
8
45
(1)
 as measured from the global x to the local 9x  axis. Table 3–2 is used in deter-
mining each element stiffness matrix based on the 9x  axes shown in Figure 3–20 for each 
element.
There are a total of eight nodal components of displacement for the truss before bound-
ary constraints are imposed. Therefore, [K] must be of order 3
8
8. For element 1, using 
Eq. (3.4.23) along with Table 3–2 for the direction cosines, we obtain

where, in Eqs. (3.8.1) through (3.8.5), the column labels indicate the degrees of freedom 
associated with each element. Also, because elements 4 and 5 lie in the plane of symmetry, 
half of their original areas have been used in Eqs. (3.8.4) and (3.8.5).
We will limit the solution to determining the displacement components. Therefore, 
considering the boundary constraints that result in zero-displacement components, we can 
immediately obtain the reduced set of equations by eliminating rows and columns in each 
element stiffness matrix corresponding to a zero-displacement component. That is, because

 (owing to the symmetry condition), we can cancel rows and columns corre-
sponding to these displacement components in each element stiffness matrix before assem-
bling the total stiffness matrix. The resulting set of stiffness equations is

The ideas presented regarding the use of symmetry should be used sparingly and ­cautiously 
in problems of vibration and buckling. For instance, a structure such as a simply supported 
beam has symmetry about its center but has antisymmetric vibration modes as well as sym-
metric vibration modes. This will be shown in Chapter 16. If only half the beam were modeled 
using reflective symmetry conditions, the support conditions would permit only the symmetric 
vibration modes.
	 3.9 	 Inclined, or Skewed, Supports
In the preceding sections, the supports were oriented such that the resulting boundary condi-
tions on the displacements were in the global directions, x and y.
However, if a support is inclined, or skewed, at an angle α from the global x axis, as shown 
at node 3 in the plane truss of Figure 3–21, the resulting boundary conditions on the displace-
ments are not in the global x – y directions but are in the local 
−
9
9
x
y  directions. We will now 
describe two methods used to handle inclined supports. 
In the first method, to account for inclined boundary conditions, we must perform a trans-
formation of the global displacements at node 3 only into the local nodal coordinate system 
−
9
9
x
y , while keeping all other displacements in the x – y global system. We can then enforce 
the zero-displacement boundary condition 93v  in the force/displacement equations and, finally, 
solve the equations in the usual manner.

In Eq. (3.9.7), we observe that only the node 3 global components are transformed, as indicated 
by the placement of the [ ]
3t
T matrix. We denote the square matrix in Eq. (3.9.7) by [
]
1T
T. In 
general, we place a 3
2
2 [ ]t  matrix in [
]
1T  wherever the transformation from global to local 
displacements is needed (where skewed supports exist).
Upon considering Eqs. (3.9.5) and (3.9.6), we observe that only node 3 components of 
{ }
d  are really transformed to local (skewed) axes components. This transformation is indeed 
necessary whenever the local axes

SOLUTION:
We will solve this problem by two methods: (1) using the Eq. (3.9.14) outlined in this 
section to transform the node 3 boundary condition to its actual local y9 direction, thus 
making 9 5 0
3v
 and (2) by using the displacements in the global reference frame without 
transforming to the local frame for node 3 components. Both methods begin by obtaining 
the element stiffness matrices and then assembling the global stiffness matrix by the direct 
stiffness method.
We begin by using Eq. (3.4.23) to determine each element stiffness matrix.

3.10  Potential Energy Approach to Derive Bar Element Equations 
121
Boundary elements are used to specify nonzero displacements and rotations to nodes. 
They are also used to evaluate reactions at rigid and flexible supports. Boundary elements 
are two-node elements. The line defined by the two nodes specifies the direction along 
which the force reaction is evaluated or the displacement is specified. In the case of moment 
reaction, the line specifies the axis about which the moment is evaluated and the rotation 
is specified.
We consider boundary elements that are used to obtain reaction forces (rigid boundary 
elements) or specify translational displacements (displacement boundary elements) as truss 
elements with only one nonzero translational stiffness. Boundary elements used to either 
evaluate reaction moments or specify rotations behave like beam elements with only one 
nonzero stiffness corresponding to the rotational stiffness about the specified axis.
The elastic boundary elements are used to model flexible supports and to calculate 
reactions at skewed or inclined boundaries. Consult Reference [9] for more details about 
using boundary elements.
	3.10 	 Potential Energy Approach to Derive  
Bar Element Equations
We now present the principle of minimum potential energy to derive the bar element equations. 
Recall from Section 2.6 that the total potential energy π p was defined as the sum of the internal 
strain energy U and the potential energy of the external forces Ω:
	
π
Ω
U
p 5
1
	
(3.10.1)
To evaluate the strain energy for a bar,we consider only the work done by the internal 
forces during deformation. Because we are dealing with a one-dimensional bar, the internal 
force doing work on a differential element of sides x
y
z
D

ment through which the force moves, given by

typically from distributed loading acting along the surface of the element (in units of force per 
unit surface area) moving through displacements us, where us are the displacements occurring 
over surface 1
S , and (3) nodal concentrated forces fix moving through nodal displacements ui. 
The forces Xb, Tx, and fix are considered to act in the local x direction of the bar as shown in 
Figure 3–26. In Eqs. (3.10.5) and (3.10.6), V is the volume of the body and 1
S  is the part of the 
surface S on which surface loading acts. For a bar element with two nodes and one degree of 
freedom per node,

.
We are now ready to describe the finite element formulation of the bar element equations 
by using the principle of minimum potential energy.
The finite element process seeks a minimum in the potential energy within the constraint 
of an assumed displacement pattern within each element. The greater the number of degrees 
of freedom associated with the element (usually meaning increasing the number of nodes), 
the more closely will the solution approximate the true one and ensure complete equilibrium 
(provided the true displacement can, in the limit, be approximated). An approximate finite 
element solution found by using the stiffness method will always provide an approximate 
value of potential energy greater than or equal to the correct one. This method also results in 
a structure behavior that is predicted to be physically stiffer than, or at best to have the same 
stiffness as, the actual one. This is explained by the fact that the structure model is allowed to 
displace only into shapes defined by the terms of the assumed displacement field within each 
element of the structure. The correct shape is usually only approximated by the assumed field, 
although the correct shape can be the same as the assumed field. The assumed field effectively 
constrains the structure from deforming in its natural manner. This constraint effect stiffens 
the predicted behavior of the structure.
Apply the following steps when using the principle of minimum potential energy to derive 
the finite element equations.
	 1.	 Formulate an expression for the total potential energy.
	 2.	 Assume the displacement pattern to vary with a finite set of undetermined parameters (here 
these are the nodal displacements ui), which are substituted into the expression for total 
potential energy.
	 3.	 Obtain a set of simultaneous equations minimizing the total potential energy with respect 
to these nodal parameters. These resulting equations represent the element equations.
The resulting equations are the approximate (or possibly exact) equilibrium equations 
whose solution for the nodal parameters seeks to minimize the potential energy when back-­
substituted into the potential energy expression. The preceding three steps will now be followed 
to derive the bar element equations and stiffness matrix.
Consider the bar element of length L, with constant cross-sectional area A, shown in  
Figure 3–26. Using Eqs. (3.10.5) and (3.10.6), we find that the total potential energy, 
Eq. (3.10.1), becomes

Loads calculated by Eqs. (3.10.20a) and (3.10.20b) are called consistent because they 
are based on the same shape functions [N] used to calculate the element stiffness matrix.

The loads calculated by Eq. (3.10.20a) and (3.10.20b) are also statically equivalent to the

To illustrate the use of Eq. (3.10.20a) to evaluate the equivalent nodal loads for a bar

A bar of length L is subjected to a linearly distributed axial line loading that varies from zero 
at node 1 to a maximum of CL at node 2 (Figure 3–27). Determine the energy equivalent 
nodal loads.

Figure 3–31 shows a plot of Eq. (3.11.6) along with the finite element solutions (part of 
which were obtained in Example 3.13). Some conclusions from these results follow.
1.	
The finite element solutions match the exact solution at the node points. The reason why 
these nodal values are correct is that the element nodal forces were calculated on the basis 
of being energy-equivalent to the distributed load based on the assumed linear displace-
ment field within each element. (For uniform cross-sectional bars and beams, the nodal

degrees of freedom are exact. In general, computed nodal degrees of freedom are not 
exact.)
2.	
Although the node values for displacement match the exact solution, the values at loca-
tions between the nodes are poor using few elements (see one- and two-element solutions) 
because we used a linear displacement function within each element, whereas the exact 
solution, Eq. (3.11.6), is a cubic function. However, because we use increasing numbers 
of elements, the finite element solution converges to the exact solution (see the four- and 
eight-element solutions in Figure 3–31).
3.	
The stress is derived from the slope of the displacement curve as s
«

(
)
E
E du dx . 
Therefore, by the finite element solution, because u is a linear function in each element, 
axial stress is constant in each element. It then takes even more elements to model the first 
derivative of the displacement function or, equivalently, the axial stress. This is shown in 
Figure 3–32, where the best results occur for the eight-element solution.
4.	
The best approximation of the stress occurs at the midpoint of the element, not at the nodes 
(Figure 3–32). This is because the derivative of displacement is better predicted between 
the nodes than at the nodes.
5.	
The stress is not continuous across element boundaries. Therefore, equilibrium is not sat-
isfied across element boundaries. Also, equilibrium within each element is, in general, not 
satisfied. This is shown in Figure 3–33 for element 1 in the two-element solution and ele-
ment 1 in the eight-element solution [in the eight-element solution the forces are obtained 
from the Autodesk computer code [9]]. As the number of elements used increases, the 
discontinuity in the stress decreases across element boundaries, and the approximation of 
equilibrium improves.
Finally, in Figure 3–34, we show the convergence of axial stress at the fixed end

as the number of elements increases.

For other kinds of elements (other than beams), this adjustment is ignored in practice. The

	3.12 	 Galerkin’s Residual Method and Its Use to Derive 
the One-Dimensional Bar Element Equations
General Formulation
We developed the bar finite element equations by the direct method in Section 3.1 and by the poten-
tial energy method (one of a number of variational methods) in Section 3.10. In fields other than 
structural/solid mechanics, it is quite probable that a variational principle, analogous to the principle 
of minimum potential energy, for instance, may not be known or even exist. In some flow problems 
in fluid mechanics and in mass transport problems (Chapter 13), we often have only the differential 
equation and boundary conditions available. However, the finite element method can still be applied.
The methods of weighted residuals applied directly to the differential equation can be used 
to develop the finite element equations. In this section, we describe Galerkin’s residual method 
in general and then apply it to the bar element. This development provides the basis for later 
applications of Galerkin’s method to the beam element in Chapter 4 and to the nonstructural 
heat-transfer element (specifically, the one-dimensional combined conduction, convection, and 
mass transport element described in Chapter 13). Because of the mass transport phenomena, the 
variational formulation is not known (or certainly is difficult to obtain), so Galerkin’s method 
is necessarily applied to develop the finite element equations.
There are a number of other residual methods. Among them are collocation, least squares, 
and subdomain as described in Section 3.13. (For more on these methods, see Reference [5].)

3.12  Galerkin’s Residual Method and Its Use to Derive the One-Dimensional Bar Element Equations
137
In weighted residual methods, a trial or approximate function is chosen to approximate 
the independent variable, such as a displacement or a temperature, in a problem defined by a 
differential equation. This trial function will not, in general, satisfy the governing differential 
equation. Thus substituting the trial function into the differential equation results in a residual 
over the whole region of the problem as follows:
	
∫∫∫RdV
v
5 minimum	
(3.12.1)
In the residual method, we require that a weighted value of the residual be a minimum over 
the whole region. The weighting functions allow the weighted integral of residuals to go to zero. 
If we denote the weighting function by W, the general form of the weighted residual integral is
	
∫∫∫RW dV
v
5 0	
(3.12.2)
Using Galerkin’s method, we choose the interpolation function, such as Eq. (3.2.8), in 
terms of Ni shape functions for the independent variable in the differential equation. In general, 
this substitution yields the residual 
? 0
R
. By the Galerkin criterion, the shape functions Ni 
are chosen to play the role of the weighting functions W. Thus for each i, we have
	
∫∫∫RN dV
i
n
i
v
5
5
0
(
1,2,..., )	
(3.12.3)
Equation (3.12.3) results in a total of n equations. Equation (3.12.3) applies to points 
within the region of a body without reference to boundary conditions such as specified applied 
loads or displacements. To obtain boundary conditions, we apply integration by parts to  
Eq. (3.12.3), which yields integrals applicable for the region and its boundary.
Bar Element Formulation
We now illustrate Galerkin’s method to formulate the bar element stiffness equations. We begin 
with the basic differential equation, without distributed load, derived in Section 3.1 as

	3.13 	 Other Residual Methods and Their Application to a 
One-Dimensional Bar Problem
As indicated in Section 3.12 when describing Galerkin’s residual method, weighted residual 
methods are based on assuming an approximate solution to the governing differential equa-
tion for the given problem. The assumed or trial solution is typically a displacement or a 
temperature function that must be made to satisfy the initial and boundary conditions of the 
problem. This trial solution will not, in general, satisfy the governing differential equation. 
Thus, substituting the trial function into the differential equation will result in some residuals 
or errors. Each residual method requires the error to vanish over some chosen intervals or at 
some chosen points. To demonstrate this concept, we will solve the problem of a rod subjected 
to a triangular load distribution as shown in Figure 3–28 (see Section 3.10) for which we also 
have an exact solution for the axial displacement given by Eq. (3.11.5) in Section 3.11. We 
will illustrate four common weighted residual methods: collocation, subdomain, least squares, 
and Galerkin’s method.
It is important to note that the primary intent in this section is to introduce you to the gen-
eral concepts of these other weighted residual methods through a simple  example. You should 
note that we will assume a displacement solution that will in general yield an approximate 
solution (in our example the assumed displacement function yields an exact solution) over the 
whole domain of the problem (the rod previously solved in Section 3.10). As you have seen 
already for the spring and bar elements, we have assumed a linear function over each spring or 
bar element, and then combined the element solutions as was illustrated in Section 3.10 for the 
same rod solved in this section. It is common practice to use the simple linear function in each 
element of a finite element model, with an increasing number of elements used to model the rod 
yielding a closer and closer approximation to the actual displacement as seen in Figure 3–31.
For clarity’s sake, Figure 3–35(a) shows the problem we are solving, along with a free-
body diagram of a section of the rod with the internal axial force P(x) shown in Figure 3–35(b).

Collocation Method
The collocation method requires that the error or residual function, R, be forced to zero at as 
many points as there are unknown coefficients. Equation (3.13.2) has three unknown coeffi-
cients. Therefore, we will make the error function equal zero at three points along the rod. We 
choose the error function to go to zero at 5 0

3.13  Other Residual Methods and Their Application to a One-Dimensional Bar Problem
141
Because we have chosen a cubic displacement function, Eq. (3.13.2), and the exact solu-
tion, Eq. (3.11.6), is also cubic, the collocation method yields the identical solution as the exact 
solution. The plot of the solution is shown in Figure 3–31 on page 133.
Subdomain Method
The subdomain method requires that the integral of the error or residual function over some 
selected subintervals be set to zero. The number of subintervals selected must equal the number 
of unknown coefficients. Because we have three unknown coefficients in the rod example, we 
must make the number of subintervals equal to three. We choose the subintervals from 0 to L/3,  
from L/3 to 2L/3, and from 2L/3 to L as follows:

where we have used Eq. (3.13.3) for R in Eqs. (3.13.8).
Integration of Eqs. (3.13.8) results in three simultaneous linear equations that can be 
solved for the coefficients 1c , 2c  and 3c . Using the numerical values for A, E, and L as previ-
ously done, the three coefficients are numerically identical to those given by Eq. (3.13.6). The 
resulting axial displacement is then identical to Eq. (3.13.7).
Least Squares Method
The least squares method requires the integral over the length of the rod of the error function 
squared to be minimized with respect to each of the unknown coefficients in the assumed 
solution, based on the following:

Hence, the solution is identical to the exact solution.
Galerkin’s Method
Galerkin’s method requires the error to be orthogonal1 to some weighting functions Wi as

3.14  Flowchart for Solution of Three-Dimensional Truss Problems 
143
Integration of Eqs. (3.13.15) results in three linear equations that can be solved for the 
unknown coefficients. The numerical values are the same as those given by Eq. (3.13.6). Hence, 
the solution is identical to the exact solution.
In conclusion, because we assumed the approximate solution in the form of a cubic in x 
and the exact solution is also a cubic in x, all residual methods have yielded the exact solution. 
The purpose of this section has still been met to illustrate the four common residual methods 
to obtain an approximate (or exact in this example) solution to a known differential equation. 
The exact solution is shown by Eq. (3.11.6) and in Figure 3–31 in Section 3.11.

	3.15 	 Computer Program Assisted  
Step-by-Step Solution for Truss Problem
In this section, we present a computer-assisted step-by-step solution of a three-dimensional 
truss (space truss) problem solved using a computer program; see Reference [9].
The computer-assisted step-by-step problem uses the truss in Example 3.8 and is shown 
in Figure 3–37.
The following steps have been used to determine the x, y, and z displacement components 
at node 1 and the stresses in each truss element.
	 1.	 The first step is to draw the three truss elements using the standard drawing program in the 
finite-element program, Autodesk [9], ANSYS [10], etc. This drawing also could be done 
using other drawing programs, such as KeyCreator [11] or SOLIDWORKS [12] and then 
imported into the finite-element program. This drawing requires defining a convenient x, 
y, z coordinate system and then inputting the x, y, and z coordinates of the two nodes mak-
ing up each truss element. When we input the nodal coordinates, we are actually defining 
the description of the overall dimensions of the model truss and the individual elements 
making up the truss model. When the individual elements, with their associated nodes, are 
created, we will have defined the topology or connectivity (which nodes are connected to 
which elements). The element numbering and node numbering are done internally within 
the computer program. This drawing process is normally the most time-consuming part of 
finite-element analysis. We often use automatic mesh-generating capabilities for two-and 
three-dimensional bodies to reduce the time and error involved with modeling.
	 2.	 The second step is to select the element type for the kind of analysis to be performed. Here 
the truss element is selected.

	 3.	 The third step is to input the geometric properties for the element. Here the cross-sectional 
area, A, is input.
	 4.	 The fourth step is to choose the material properties (modulus of elasticity, E, for a truss 
element). Here ASTM A 36 steel is selected, which then means the modulus of elasticity 
has been input.
	 5.	 The fifth step is to apply the boundary conditions to the proper nodes using the proper 
boundary condition command. Here pinned boundary condition is appropriate and applied 
to the nodes labeled 2, 3, and 4 and roller condition preventing y displacement to node 1 
in Figure 3–37.
	 6.	 The sixth step is to apply the nodal load. Here the load of 5000 N is applied in the 
­negative-z direction.
	 7.	 The seventh step is an optional check of the model. If you choose to perform this step, you 
will see the boundary conditions represented by a triangle at nodes 2, 3, and 4, a circle 
at node 1, and the load represented by an arrow pointing in the negative-z direction at 
node 1.
	 8.	 In step eight, we perform the analysis. This means the solution of simultaneous equations 
of the form 
{ }
{ } 5 [
]
F
K
d  for displacement components x, y, and z at node 1 are deter-
mined. The stresses in each truss element are also determined.
	 9.	 In step nine, we select the results relevant for the specific analysis. Here the displacement 
plot and axial stress plot are the relevant quantities for design. Figures 3–38(a) and (b) show 
the maximum displacement plot and axial stress plot for the truss. The largest stress of 
221.38 Mpa (negative sign indicates compressive stress) is in the lower element (element 
three). The stresses in elements one and two are 27.22 Mpa and 10.55 Mpa, respectively.

Development of Beam 
Equations
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Review basic concepts of beam bending.
■ Derive the stiffness matrix for a beam element.
■ Demonstrate beam analysis using the direct stiffness method.
■ Illustrate the effects of shear deformation in shorter beams.
■ Introduce the work-equivalence method for replacing distributed loading by a set of 
discrete loads.
■ Introduce the general formulation for solving beam problems with distributed load-
ing acting on them.
■ Analyze beams with distributed loading acting on them.
■ Compare the finite element solution to an exact solution for a beam.
■ Derive the stiffness matrix for the beam element with nodal hinge.
■ Show how the potential energy method can be used to derive the beam element 
equations.
■ Apply Galerkin’s residual method for deriving the beam element equations.
Introduction
We begin this chapter by developing the stiffness matrix for the bending of a beam element, the 
most common of all structural elements, as evidenced by its prominence in buildings, bridges, 
towers, and many other structures. The beam element is considered to be straight and to have 
constant cross-sectional area. We will first derive the beam element stiffness matrix by using 
the principles developed for simple beam theory.
We will then present simple examples to illustrate the assemblage of beam element stiff-
ness matrices and the solution of beam problems by the direct stiffness method presented in 
Chapter 2. The solution of a beam problem illustrates that the degrees of freedom associated 
with a node are a transverse displacement and a rotation. We will include the nodal shear forces 
and bending moments and the resulting shear force and bending moment diagrams as part of 
the total solution.

Next, we will discuss procedures for handling distributed loading, because beams and 
frames are often subjected to distributed loading as well as concentrated nodal loading. We will 
follow the discussion with solutions of beams subjected to distributed loading and compare a 
finite element solution to an exact solution for a beam subjected to a distributed loading.
We will then develop the beam element stiffness matrix for a beam element with a nodal 
hinge and illustrate the solution of a beam with an internal hinge.
To further acquaint you with the potential energy approach for developing stiffness matri-
ces and equations, we will again develop the beam bending element equations using this 
approach. We hope to increase your confidence in this approach. It will be used throughout 
much of this text to develop stiffness matrices and equations for more complex elements, such 
as two-dimensional (plane) stress, axisymmetric stress, and three-dimensional stress.
Finally, the Galerkin residual method is applied to derive the beam element equations.
The concepts presented in this chapter are prerequisite to understanding the concepts for 
frame analysis presented in Chapter 5.
	 4.1 	 Beam Stiffness
In this section, we will derive the stiffness matrix for a simple beam element. A beam is a long, 
slender structural member generally subjected to transverse loading that produces significant 
bending effects as opposed to twisting or axial effects. This bending deformation is measured 
as a transverse displacement and a rotation. Hence, the degrees of freedom considered per node 
are a transverse displacement and a rotation (as opposed to only an axial displacement for the 
bar element of Chapter 3).
Consider the beam element shown in Figure 4–1. The beam is of length L with axial local 
coordinate x and transverse local coordinate y. The local transverse nodal displacements are 
given by vi’s and the rotations by 
i
f ’s. The local nodal forces are given by fiy’s and the bending 
moments by mi’s as shown. We initially neglect all axial effects.
At all nodes, the following sign conventions are used:
	 1.	 Moments are positive in the counterclockwise direction.
	 2.	 Rotations are positive in the counterclockwise direction.
	 3.	 Forces are positive in the positive y direction.
	 4.	 Displacements are positive in the positive y direction.

Figure 4–2 indicates the sign conventions used in simple beam theory for positive shear forces 
V and bending moments m.
Beam Stiffness Matrix Based on Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory 
(Considering Bending Deformations Only)
The differential equation governing elementary linear-elastic beam behavior [1] (called the 
Euler-Bernoulli beam as derived by Euler and Bernoulli) is based on plane cross sections 
perpendicular to the longitudinal centroidal axis of the beam before bending occurs remain-
ing plane and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis after bending occurs. This is illustrated 
in Figure 4–3, where a plane through vertical line a
c
2  [Figure 4–3(a)] is perpendicular to 
the longitudinal x axis before bending, and this same plane through a
c
9
9
2
 [rotating through 
angle f in Figure 4–3(b)] remains perpendicular to the bent x axis after bending. This occurs 
in practice only when a pure couple or constant moment exists in the beam. However it is a 
reasonable assumption that yields equations that quite accurately predict beam behavior for 
most practical beams.
The differential equation is derived as follows. Consider the beam shown in Figure 4–3 
subjected to a distributed loading w(x) (force/length). From the force and moment equilibrium 
of a differential element of the beam, shown in Figure 4–3(c), we have

The final form of Eq. (4.1.1c), relating the shear force to the bending moment, is obtained by 
dividing the left equation by dx and then taking the limit of the equation as dx approaches 0. 
The w(x) term then disappears.
Also, the curvature κ  of the beam is related to the moment by

(4.1.2)
The complete cubic displacement function Eq. (4.1.2) is appropriate because there are four 
total degrees of freedom (a transverse displacement vi and a small rotation fi at each node). 
The cubic function also satisfies the basic beam differential equation—further justifying its 
selection. In addition, the cubic function also satisfies the conditions of displacement and slope 
continuity at nodes shared by two elements.
Using the same procedure as described in Section 2.2, we express v as a function of the 
nodal degrees of freedom v1, v2, f1, and f2 as follows:

(4.1.14)
Equation (4.1.13) indicates that [k] relates transverse forces and bending moments to transverse 
displacements and rotations, whereas axial effects have been neglected.
In the beam element stiffness matrix [Eq. (4.1.14)] derived in this section, it is assumed 
that the beam is long and slender; that is, the length, L, to depth, h, dimension ratio of the 
beam is large. In this case, the deflection due to bending that is predicted by using the stiffness 
matrix from Eq. (4.1.14) is quite adequate. However, for short, deep beams the transverse shear 
deformation can be significant and can have the same order of magnitude contribution to the 
total deformation of the beam. This is seen by the expressions for the bending and shear contri-
butions to the deflection of a beam, where the bending contribution is of order L h
( / )3, whereas 
the shear contribution is only of order (L/h). A general rule for rectangular cross-section beams 
is that for a length at least eight times the depth, the transverse shear deflection is less than 
five percent of the bending deflection [4]. Castigliano’s method for finding beam and frame 
deflections is a convenient way to include the effects of the transverse shear term as shown in 
Reference [4]. The derivation of the stiffness matrix for a beam including the transverse shear 
deformation contribution is given in a number of references [5–8].

4.1  Beam Stiffness
177
The inclusion of the shear deformation in beam theory with application to vibration problems 
was developed by Timoshenko and is known as the Timoshenko beam [9–10].
Beam Stiffness Matrix Based on Timoshenko Beam Theory (Including 
Transverse Shear Deformation)
The shear deformation beam theory is derived as follows. Instead of plane sections remaining 
plane after bending occurs as shown previously in Figure 4–5, the shear deformation (deforma-
tion due to the shear force V) is now included. Referring to Figure 4–6, we observe a section of 
a beam of differential length dx with the cross section assumed to remain plane but no longer 
perpendicular to the neutral axis (x axis) due to the inclusion of the shear force resulting in a 
rotation term indicated by b. The total deflection of the beam at a point x now consists of two 
parts, one caused by bending and one by shear force, so that the slope of the deflected curve 
at point x is now given by

To derive the stiffness matrix for the beam element including transverse shear deformation, 
we assume the transverse displacement to be given by the cubic function in Eq. (4.1.2). In a 
manner similar to [8], we choose transverse shear strain g consistent with the cubic polynomial 
for v(x), such that g is a constant given by

Using the cubic displacement function for v, the slope relation given by Eq. (4.1.15a), and the

and the shear force-shear strain relation Eq. (4.1.15c), in the bending moment–shear force

In Eq. (4.1.15n) remember that g represents the transverse shear term, and if we set g 5 0, we 
obtain Eq. (4.1.14) for the beam stiffness matrix, neglecting transverse shear deformation. To 
more easily see the effect of the shear correction factor, we define the nondimensional shear

	 4.2 	 Example of Assemblage of Beam Stiffness Matrices
Step 5 Assemble the Element Equations to Obtain the Global  
Equations and Introduce Boundary Conditions
Consider the beam in Figure 4–7 as an example to illustrate the procedure for assemblage of 
beam element stiffness matrices. Assume EI to be constant throughout the beam. A force of 
5000 N and a moment of 2500 N-m are applied to the beam at midlength. The left end is a 
fixed support and the right end is a pin support.
First, we discretize the beam into two elements with nodes 1–3 as shown. We include a 
node at midlength because applied force and moment exist at midlength and, at this time, loads 
are assumed to be applied only at nodes. (Another procedure for handling loads applied on 
elements will be discussed in Section 4.4.)

The total stiffness matrix can now be assembled for the beam by using the direct stiffness 
method. When the total (global) stiffness matrix has been assembled, the external global nodal 
forces are related to the global nodal displacements. Through direct superposition and Eqs. 
(4.2.1) and (4.2.2), the governing equations for the beam are thus given by

	 4.3 	 Examples of Beam Analysis Using the Direct

We will now perform complete solutions for beams with various boundary supports and loads 
to illustrate further the use of the equations developed in Section 4.1.
EXAMPLE 4.1
Using the direct stiffness method, solve the problem of the propped cantilever beam sub-
jected to end load P in Figure 4–8. The beam is assumed to have constant EI and length 2L. 
It is supported by a roller at midlength and is built in at the right end.

■Figure 4–8  Propped cantilever beam
SOLUTION:
We have discretized the beam and established global coordinate axes as shown in ­Figure 4–8. 
We will determine the nodal displacements and rotations, the reactions, and the complete 
shear force and bending moment diagrams.

The results of Eqs. (4.3.8) can be interpreted as follows: The value of F

 is the 
applied force at node 1, as it must be. The values of F y
2 , F y
3 , and M3 are the reactions from 
the supports as felt by the beam. The moments M1 and M2 are zero because no applied or 
reactive moments are present on the beam at node 1 or node 2.
It is generally necessary to determine the local nodal forces associated with each ele-
ment of a large structure to perform a stress analysis of the entire structure. We will thus 
consider the forces in element 1 of this example to illustrate this concept (element 2 can be 
treated similarly). Using Eqs. (4.3.5) and (4.3.6) in the f

(4.3.10)
A free-body diagram of element 1, shown in Figure 4–9(a), should help you to understand 
the results of Eqs. (4.3.10). The figure shows a nodal transverse force of negative P at node 
1 and of positive P and negative moment PL at node 2. These values are consistent with 
the results given by Eqs. (4.3.10). For completeness, the free-body diagram of element 2 is 
shown in Figure 4–9(b). We can easily verify the element nodal forces by writing an equa-
tion similar to Eq. (4.3.9). From the results of Eqs. (4.3.8), the nodal forces and moments

In general, for complex beam structures, we will use the element local forces to determine 
the shear force and bending moment diagrams for each element. We can then use these values 
for design purposes. Chapter 5 will further discuss this concept as used in computer codes.
EXAMPLE 4.2
Determine the nodal displacements and rotations, global nodal forces, and element forces 
for the beam shown in Figure 4–13. We have discretized the beam as indicated by the node 
numbering. The beam is fixed at nodes 1 and 5 and has a roller support at node 3. Vertical 
loads of 50 kN each are applied at nodes 2 and 4. Let

SOLUTION:
We must have consistent units; therefore, the 10-ft lengths in Figure 4–13 will be con-
verted to 120 in. during the solution. Using Eq. (4.1.10), along with superposition of the 
four beam element stiffness matrices, we obtain the global stiffness matrix and the global 
equations as given in Eq. (4.3.11). Here the lengths of each element are the same. Thus, 
we can factor an L out of the superimposed stiffness matrix.
(4.3.11)
For a longhand solution, we reduce Eq. (4.3.11) in the usual manner by application 
of the boundary conditions

As observed from the solution of this problem, the greater the static redundancy 
(degrees of static indeterminacy or number of unknown forces and moments that cannot 
be determined by equations of statics), the smaller the kinematic redundancy (unknown 
nodal degrees of freedom, such as displacements or slopes)—hence, the fewer the number 
of unknown degrees of freedom to be solved for. Moreover, the use of symmetry, when 
applicable, reduces the number of unknown degrees of freedom even further. We can now 
back-substitute the results from Eq. (4.3.14), along with the numerical values for E, I, and 
L, into Eq. (4.3.12) to determine the global nodal forces as

Once again, the global nodal forces (and moments) at the support nodes (nodes 1, 3, and 5) 
can be interpreted as the reaction forces, and the global nodal forces at nodes 2 and 4 are 
the applied nodal forces.
However, for large structures we must obtain the local element shear force and bending 
moment at each node end of the element because these values are used in the design/analysis

If you wish, you can draw a free-body diagram to confirm the equilibrium of the element.
Finally, you should note that because of reflective symmetry about a vertical plane passing 
through node 3, we could have initially considered one-half of this beam and used the follow-
ing model. The fixed support at node 3 is due to the slope being zero at node 3 because of the 
symmetry in the loading and support conditions.

4.3  Examples of Beam Analysis Using the Direct Stiffness Method
193
EXAMPLE 4.5
To illustrate the effects of shear deformation along with the usual bending deformation, we 
now solve the simple beam shown in Figure 4–19. We will use the beam stiffness matrix 
given by Eq. (4.1.15o) that includes both the bending and shear deformation contributions 
for deformation in the x – y plane. The beam is simply supported with a concentrated load 
of 10,000 N applied at mid-span. We let material properties be E 5 207 GPa and G 5 80 
GPa. The beam width and height are b 5 25 mm and h 5 50 mm, respectively.

SOLUTION:
We will use symmetry to simplify the solution. Therefore, only one half of the beam will be 
considered with the slope at the center forced to be zero. Also, one-half of the ­concentrated 
load is then used. The model with symmetry enforced is shown in Figure 4–20.
The finite element model will consist of only one beam element. Using Eq. (4.1.15o) 
for the Timoshenko beam element stiffness matrix, we obtain the global equations as

	 4.4 	 Distributed Loading
Beam members can support distributed loading as well as concentrated nodal loading. There-
fore, we must be able to account for distributed loading. Consider the fixed-fixed beam sub-
jected to a uniformly distributed loading w shown in Figure 4–21. The reactions, determined 
from structural analysis theory [2], are shown in Figure 4–22. These reactions are called fixed-
end reactions. In general, fixed-end reactions are those reactions at the ends of an element 
if the ends of the element are assumed to be fixed—that is, if displacements and rotations are 
prevented. (Those of you who are unfamiliar with the analysis of indeterminate structures should 
assume these reactions as given and proceed with the rest of the discussion; we will develop 
these results in a subsequent presentation of the work-equivalence method.) Therefore, guided 
by the results from structural analysis for the case of a uniformly distributed load, we replace 
the load by concentrated nodal forces and moments tending to have the same effect on the beam 
as the actual distributed load. Figure 4–23 illustrates this idea for a beam. We have replaced the 
uniformly distributed load by a statically equivalent force system consisting of a concentrated 
nodal force and moment at each end of the member carrying the distributed load. That is, 
both the statically equivalent concentrated nodal forces and moments and the original distrib-
uted load have the same resultant force and same moment about an arbitrarily chosen point.

These statically equivalent forces are always of opposite sign from the fixed-end reactions. 
If we want to analyze the behavior of loaded member 2–3 in better detail, we can place a node 
at midspan and use the same procedure just described for each of the two elements representing 
the horizontal member. That is, to determine the maximum deflection and maximum moment 
in the beam span, a node 5 is needed at midspan of beam segment 2–3, and work-equivalent 
forces and moments are applied to each element (from node 2 to node 5 and from node 5 to 
node 3) shown in Figure 4–23(c).
Work-Equivalence Method
We can use the work-equivalence method to replace a distributed load by a set of discrete 
loads. This method is based on the concept that the work of the distributed load w(x) in going 
through the displacement field v(x) is equal to the work done by nodal loads fiy and mi in 
going through nodal displacements vi and 
i
f  for arbitrary nodal displacements. To illustrate 
the method, we consider the example shown in Figure 4–24. The work due to the distributed 
load is given by

Example of Load Replacement
To illustrate more clearly the concept of work equivalence, we will now consider a beam 
subjected to a specified distributed load. Consider the uniformly loaded beam shown in 
­Figure 4–25(a). The support conditions are not shown because they are not relevant to the 
replacement scheme. By letting W
W

distributed and by assuming arbitrary f1, f2, v1, and 
v2, we will find equivalent nodal forces and moments m1, m2, f y

2 . Figure 4–25(b) shows 
the nodal forces and moments directions as positive based on Figure 4–1.

(4.4.7)
We can conclude that, in general, for any given load function w(x), we can multiply by 
v(x) and then integrate according to Eq. (4.4.3) to obtain the concentrated nodal forces (and/or 
moments) used to replace the distributed load. Moreover, we can obtain the load replacement 
by using the concept of fixed-end reactions from structural analysis theory. Tables of fixed-end 
reactions have been generated for numerous load cases and can be found in texts on struc-
tural analysis such as Reference [2]. A table of equivalent nodal forces has been generated in 
Appendix D of this text, guided by the fact that fixed-end reaction forces are of opposite sign 
from those obtained by the work equivalence method.
Hence, if a concentrated load is applied other than at the natural intersection of two ele-
ments, we can use the concept of equivalent nodal forces to replace the concentrated load by 
nodal concentrated values acting at the beam ends, instead of creating a node on the beam at 
the location where the load is applied. We provide examples of this procedure for handling 
concentrated loads on elements in beam Example 4.7 and in plane frame Example 5.3.
General Formulation
In general, we can account for distributed loads or concentrated loads acting on beam elements 
by starting with the following formulation application for a general structure:

(4.4.8)
where {F} are the concentrated nodal forces and {F0} are called the equivalent nodal forces, 
now expressed in terms of global-coordinate components, which are of such magnitude that 
they yield the same displacements at the nodes as would the distributed load. Using the table 
in Appendix D of equivalent nodal forces {f0} expressed in terms of local-coordinate compo-
nents, we can express {F0} in terms of global-coordinate components.
Recall from Section 3.10 the derivation of the element equations by the principle of mini-
mum potential energy. Starting with Eqs. (3.10.19) and (3.10.20), the minimization of the total 
potential energy resulted in the same form of equation as Eq. (4.4.8) where {F0} now represents 
the same work-equivalent force replacement system as given by Eq. (3.10.20a) for surface 
traction replacement. Also, F

Examples 4.6 through 4.8 illustrate the method of equivalent nodal forces for solving beams 
subjected to distributed and concentrated loadings. We will use global-coordinate notation in 
Examples 4.6 through 4.8—treating the beam as a general structure rather than as an element.
EXAMPLE 4.6
For the cantilever beam subjected to the uniform load w in Figure 4–26, solve for the right-
end vertical displacement and rotation and then for the nodal forces. Assume the beam to 
have constant EI throughout its length.
Solution:
We begin by discretizing the beam. Here only one element will be used to represent the 
whole beam. Next, the distributed load is replaced by its work-equivalent nodal forces 
as shown in Figure 4–26(b). The work-equivalent nodal forces are those that result from 
the uniformly distributed load acting over the whole beam given by Eq. (4.4.10). (Or see

The negative signs in the answers indicate that v2 is downward and f2 is clockwise. In this 
case, the method of replacing the distributed load by discrete concentrated loads gives exact 
solutions for the displacement and rotation as could be obtained by classical methods, such 
as double integration [1]. This is expected, as the  work-equivalence method ensures that the 
nodal displacement and rotation from the finite element method match those from an exact 
solution.
We will now illustrate the procedure for obtaining the global nodal forces. For conve-

(4.4.17)
In Eq. (4.4.17), 
y
F1  is the vertical force reaction and M1 is the moment reaction as applied 
by the clamped support at node 1. The results for displacement given by Eq. (4.4.14b) and 
the global nodal forces given by Eq. (4.4.17) are sufficient to complete the solution of the 
cantilever beam problem.
A free-body diagram of the beam using the reactions from Eq. (4.4.17) verifies both 
force and moment equilibrium as shown in Figure 4–26(c).

4  |  Development of Beam Equations
202
The nodal force and moment reactions obtained by Eq. (4.4.17) illustrate the importance 
of using Eq. (4.4.8) to obtain the correct global nodal forces and moments. By subtracting the 
work-equivalent force matrix, F
{
}
0 , from the product of [K] times {d}, we obtain the correct 
reactions at node 1 as can be verified by simple static equilibrium equations. This verification 
validates the general method as follows:
1.	
Replace the distributed load by its work-equivalent as shown in Figure 4–26(b) to identify 
the nodal force and moment used in the solution.
2.	
Assemble the global force and stiffness matrices and global equations illustrated by 
Eq. (4.4.12).
3.	
Apply the boundary conditions to reduce the set of equations as done in previous problems 
and illustrated by Eq. (4.4.13) where the original four equations have been reduced to two 
equations to be solved for the unknown displacement and rotation.
4.	
Solve for the unknown displacement and rotation given by Eq. (4.4.14a) and Eq. (4.4.14b).
5.	
Use Eq. (4.4.8) as illustrated by Eq. (4.4.17) to obtain the final correct global nodal forces 
and moments. Those forces and moments at supports, such as the left end of the cantilever 
in Figure 4–26(a), will be the reactions.
We will solve the following example to illustrate the procedure for handling concentrated 
loads acting on beam elements at locations other than nodes.
EXAMPLE 4.7
For the cantilever beam subjected to the concentrated load P in Figure 4–27, solve for the 
right-end vertical displacement and rotation and the nodal forces, including reactions, by 
replacing the concentrated load with equivalent nodal forces acting at each end of the beam. 
Assume EI constant throughout the beam.
■
■Figure 4–27  (a) Cantilever beam subjected to a concentrated load and (b) the equivalent 
nodal force replacement system
Solution:
We begin by discretizing the beam. Here only one element is used with nodes at each end 
of the beam. We then replace the concentrated load as shown in Figure 4–27(b) by using 
appropriate loading case 1 in Appendix D. Using Eq. (4.4.9) and the beam element stiffness 
matrix Eq. (4.1.14), we obtain

(4.4.23)
We can see from Eq. (4.4.23) that F y
1  is equivalent to the vertical reaction force and M1 is 
the reaction moment as applied by the clamped support at node 1.
Again, the reactions obtained by Eq. (4.4.23) can be verified to be correct by using 
static equilibrium equations to validate once more the correctness of the general formulation 
and procedures summarized in the steps given after Example 4.6.
To illustrate the procedure for handling concentrated nodal forces and distributed loads 
acting simultaneously on beam elements, we will solve the following example.
EXAMPLE 4.8
For the cantilever beam subjected to the concentrated free-end load P and the uniformly 
distributed load w acting over the whole beam as shown in Figure 4–28, determine the free-
end displacements and the nodal forces.

Solution:
Once again, the beam is modeled using one element with nodes 1 and 2, and the distributed 
load is replaced as shown in Figure 4–28(b) using appropriate loading case 4 in Appendix D.

(4.4.28)
From Eq. (4.4.28), we see that F y
1  is equivalent to the vertical reaction force, M1 is the 
reaction moment at node 1, and F y
2  is equal to the applied downward force P at node 2. 
[Remember that only the equivalent nodal force matrix is subtracted, not the original con-
centrated load matrix. This is based on the general formulation, Eq. (4.4.8).]

To generalize the work-equivalent method, we apply it to a beam with more than one 
element as shown in the following Example 4.9.
EXAMPLE 4.9
For the fixed–fixed beam subjected to the linear varying distributed loading acting over the 
whole beam shown in Figure 4–29(a) determine the displacement and rotation at the center 
and the reactions.
Solution:
The beam is now modeled using two elements with nodes 1, 2, and 3 and the distributed 
load is replaced as shown in Figure 4–29(b) using the appropriate load cases 4 and 5 in 
Appendix D. Note that load case 5 is used for element one as it has only the linear varying 
distributed load acting on it with a high end value of w/2 as shown in Figure 4–29(a), while 
both load cases 4 and 5 are used for element two as the distributed load is divided into a 
uniform part with magnitude w/2 and a linear varying part with magnitude at the high end 
of the load equal to w/2 also.

We used symbol L to represent one-half the length of the beam. If we replace L with the 
actual length l
L
5 2 , we obtain the reactions for case 5 in Appendix D, thus verifying the 
correctness of our result.
In summary, for any structure in which an equivalent nodal force replacement is made, 
the actual nodal forces acting on the structure are determined by first evaluating the effective 
nodal forces F
{
}
0  for the structure and then subtracting the equivalent nodal forces F e
{
}
( )  
for the structure, as indicated in Eq. (4.4.8). Similarly, for any element of a structure in 
which equivalent nodal force replacement is made, the actual local nodal forces acting on 
the element are determined by first evaluating the effective local nodal forces f e
{
}
( )  for the 
element and then subtracting the equivalent local nodal forces f
{
}
0  associated only with 
the element, as indicated in Eq. (4.4.11). We provide other examples of this procedure in 
plane frame Examples 5.2 and 5.3.

for the cantilever beam shown in Figure 4–30 subjected to a uniformly distributed load. Both

We conclude that the beam theory solution for midlength displacement, 5 2 0.823 mm
y
, 
is greater than the finite element solution for displacement, 
5 2 0.788 mm
v
. In general, 
the displacements evaluated using the cubic function for v are lower as predicted by the finite 
element method than by the beam theory except at the nodes. This is always true for beams 
subjected to some form of distributed load that are modeled using the cubic displacement 
function. The exception to this result is at the nodes, where the beam theory and finite element 
results are identical because of the work-equivalence concept used to replace the distributed 
load by work-equivalent discrete loads at the nodes.
The beam theory solution predicts a quartic (fourth-order) polynomial expression for y 
[Eq. (4.5.5)] for a beam subjected to uniformly distributed loading, while the finite element 
solution v(x) assumes a cubic displacement behavior in each beam element under all load 
conditions. The finite element solution predicts a stiffer structure than the actual one. This is 
expected, as the finite element model forces the beam into specific modes of displacement and 
effectively yields a stiffer model than the actual structure. However, as more and more elements 
are used in the model, the finite element solution converges to the beam theory solution.
For the special case of a beam subjected to only nodal concentrated loads, the beam theory 
predicts a cubic displacement behavior, as the moment is a linear function and is integrated 
twice to obtain the resulting cubic displacement function. A simple verification of this cubic 
displacement behavior would be to solve the cantilevered beam subjected to an end load. In this 
special case, the finite element solution for displacement matches the beam theory solution for 
all locations along the beam length, as both functions y(x) and v(x) are then cubic functions.

and proof that compatible and complete displacement functions (as described in Section 3.2) used 
in the displacement formulation of the finite element method yield an upper bound on the true 
stiffness, hence a lower bound on the displacement of the problem, is discussed in Reference [3].
Under uniformly distributed loading, the beam theory solution predicts a quadratic moment 
and a linear shear force in the beam. However, the finite element solution using the cubic dis-
placement function predicts a linear bending moment and a constant shear force within each 
beam element used in the model.
We will now determine the bending moment and shear force in the present problem based 
on the finite element method. The bending moment is given by

4.5  Comparison of the Finite Element Solution to the Exact Solution for a Beam
213
The bending moment is derived by taking two derivatives on the displacement function. 
It then takes more elements to model the second derivative of the displacement function. 
Therefore, the finite element solution does not predict the bending moment as well as it does 
the displacement. For the uniformly loaded beam, the finite element model predicts a linear 
bending moment variation as shown in Figure 4–31(b). The best approximation for bending 
moment appears at the midpoint of the element.
The shear force is derived by taking three derivatives on the displacement function. For 
the uniformly loaded beam, the resulting shear force shown in Figure 4–31(c) is a constant 
throughout the single-element model. Again, the best approximation for shear force is at the 
midpoint of the element.
It should be noted that if we use Eq. (4.4.11), that is, f

The two-element solution yields nodal displacements that match the beam theory results 
exactly [see Eqs. (4.5.9) and (4.5.12)]. A plot of the two-element displacement throughout the 
length of the beam would be a cubic displacement within each element. Within element 1, the 
plot would start at a displacement of 0 at node 1 and finish at a displacement of 20.823 mm 
at node 2. A cubic function would connect these values. Similarly, within element 2, the plot 
would start at a displacement of 20.823 mm and finish at a displacement of 22.35 mm at 
node 2 [see Figure 4–31(a)]. A cubic function would again connect these values.
	 4.6 	 Beam Element with Nodal Hinge
In some beams an internal hinge may be present. In general, this internal hinge causes a 
discontinuity in the slope or rotation of the deflection curve at the hinge. Consider the beam 
shown with two elements and a nodal hinge at node 2 separating the two elements as shown 
in Figure 4–33(a). In general, f2
(1) for element 1 is not equal to f 2
(2) for element 2, as shown in 
Figures 4–33(b) and (c). At hinge nodes, rotations are said to be double valued. To model the 
hinge, we consider the hinge to be placed on either the right end of element 1 or on the left end 
of element 2 but not on both elements at node 2. Examples 4.10 and 4.11 will illustrate how to 
solve beam problems with nodal hinges.
Also, the bending moment is zero at the hinge. We could construct other types of connec-
tions that release other generalized end forces; that is, connections can be designed to make 
the shear force or axial force zero at the connection. These special conditions can be treated by 
starting with the generalized unreleased beam stiffness matrix [Eq. (4.1.14)] and eliminating 
the known zero force or moment. This yields a modified stiffness matrix with the desired force 
or moment equal to zero and the corresponding displacement or slope eliminated.

4.6  Beam Element with Nodal Hinge
215
We now consider the most common cases of a beam element with a nodal hinge at the right 
end or left end, as shown in Figure 4–33. For the beam element with a hinge at its right end, 
the moment m2 is zero and we partition the [k] matrix [Eq. (4.1.14)] to eliminate the degree of 
freedom f2 (which is not zero, in general) associated with m 5 0

SOLUTION:
We can consider the hinge as part of element 1. Therefore, with the hinge located at the 
right end of element 1, Eq. (4.6.13) contains the correct stiffness matrix for element 1. The 
stiffness matrix of element 1 with L

It should be noted that another way to solve the nodal hinge of Example 4.10 would be 
to assume a nodal hinge at the right end of element 1 and at the left end of element 2. Hence, 
we would use the three-equation stiffness matrix of Eq. (4.6.12) for the left element and the 
three-equation stiffness matrix of Eq. (4.6.14) for the right element. This results in the hinge 
rotation being condensed out of the global equations. You can verify that we get the same result 
for the displacement as given by Eq. (4.6.19). However, we must then go back to Eq. (4.6.6) 
using it separately for each element to obtain the rotation at node 2 for each element. We leave 
this verification to your discretion.
EXAMPLE 4.11
Determine the slope at node 2 and the deflection and slope at node 3 for the beam with 
internal hinge located at node 3, as shown in Figure 4–35. Nodes 1 and 4 are fixed, and there 
is a knifeedge support at node 2. Let E 5 210 GPa and

	 4.7 	 Potential Energy Approach to Derive Beam  
Element Equations
We will now derive the beam element equations using the principle of minimum potential 
energy. The procedure is similar to that used in Section 3.10 in deriving the bar element equa-
tions. Again, our primary purpose in applying the principle of minimum potential energy is to 
enhance your understanding of the principle. It will be used routinely in subsequent chapters 
to develop element stiffness equations. We use the same notation here as in Section 3.10.
The total potential energy for a beam is

where body forces are now neglected. The terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (4.7.3) repre-
sent the potential energy of (1) transverse surface loading Ty (in units of force per unit surface 
area, acting over surface S1 and moving through displacements over which Ty act); (2) nodal 
concentrated force Piy moving through displacements vi; and (3) moments mi moving through 
rotations 
i
f . Again, v is the transverse displacement function for the beam element of length 
L shown in Figure 4–36.
Consider the beam element to have constant cross-sectional area A. The differential vol-
ume for the beam element can then be expressed as

4.8  Galerkin’s Method for Deriving Beam Element Equations 
225
Equation (4.7.20) represents the local stiffness matrix for a beam element. As expected, Eq. 
(4.7.20) is identical to Eq. (4.1.14) developed previously.
It is worth noting that the strain energy U is the first term on the right side of Eq. (4.7.15) 
and {d} is not a function of x. If we also consider E and I to be constant over each element 
length L, we can express U as

Summary Equations
Note that when element matrices are assembled, two shear forces and two moments from 
adjacent elements contribute to the concentrated force and concentrated moment at the node 
common to the adjacent elements as shown in Figure 4–38. These concentrated shear forces

Frame and Grid Equations
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Derive the two-dimensional arbitrarily oriented beam element stiffness matrix.
■ Demonstrate solutions of rigid plane frames by the direct stiffness method.
■ Describe how to handle inclined or skewed supports.
■ Derive the stiffness matrix and equations for grid analysis.
■ Provide equations to determine torsional constants for various cross sections.
■ Illustrate the solution of grid structures.
■ Develop the stiffness matrix for a beam element arbitrarily oriented in space.
■ Present the solution of a space frame.
■ Introduce the concept of substructuring.
Introduction
Many structures, such as buildings (Figure 5–1) and bridges, are composed of frames and/or grids. 
This chapter develops the equations and methods for solution of plane and space frames and grids.
First, we will develop the stiffness matrix for a beam element arbitrarily oriented in a 
plane. We will then include the axial nodal displacement degree of freedom in the local beam 
element stiffness matrix. Then we will combine these results to develop the stiffness matrix, 
including axial deformation effects, for an arbitrarily oriented beam element, thus making it 
possible to analyze plane frames. Specific examples of plane frame analysis follow. We will 
then consider frames with inclined or skewed supports.
Next, we will develop the grid element stiffness matrix. We will present the solution of a 
grid deck system to illustrate the application of the grid equations. We will then develop the 
stiffness matrix for a beam element arbitrarily oriented in space. We will also consider the 
concept of substructure analysis.
	 5.1 	 Two-Dimensional Arbitrarily Oriented Beam Element
We can derive the stiffness matrix for an arbitrarily oriented beam element, as shown 
in ­Figure 5–2, in a manner similar to that used for the bar element in Chapter 3. The 
local axes x9 and y9 are located along the beam element and transverse to the beam

	(5.1.11)
The analysis of a rigid plane frame can be undertaken by applying stiffness matrix Eq. (5.1.11). 
A rigid plane frame is defined here as a series of beam elements rigidly connected to each 
other; that is, the original angles made between elements at their joints remain unchanged after 
the deformation due to applied loads or applied displacements.
Furthermore, moments are transmitted from one element to another at the joints. Hence, 
moment continuity exists at the rigid joints. In addition, the element centroids, as well as 
the applied loads, lie in a common plane (x – y plane). From Eq. (5.1.11), we observe that the 
element stiffnesses of a frame are functions of E, A, L, I, and the angle of orientation θ of the 
element with respect to the global-coordinate axes. It should be noted that computer programs 
often refer to the frame element as a beam element, with the understanding that the program 
is using the stiffness matrix in Eq. (5.1.11) for plane frame analysis.
	 5.2 	 Rigid Plane Frame Examples
To illustrate the use of the equations developed in Section 5.1, we will now perform complete 
solutions for the following rigid plane frames.
EXAMPLE 5.1
As the first example of rigid plane frame analysis, solve the simple “bent” shown in Figure 5–4.

SOLUTION:
The frame is fixed at nodes 1 and 4 and subjected to a positive horizontal force of 40 kN 
applied at node 2 and to a positive moment of 500 N-m. applied at node 3. The global-­
coordinate axes and the element lengths are shown in Figure 5–4.

(5.2.11)
A free-body diagram of each element is shown in Figure 5–5 along with equilibrium 
verification. In Figure 5–5, the x9 axis is directed from node 1 to node 2—consistent with 
the order of the nodal degrees of freedom used in developing the stiffness matrix for the 
element. Since the x–y plane was initially established as shown in Figure 5–4, the z axis is 
directed outward—consequently, so is the z9 axis (recall z
z
9 5 ). The y9 axis is then estab-
lished such that x9 cross y9 yields the direction of z9. The signs on the resulting element forces 
in Eq. (5.2.11) are thus consistently shown in Figure 5–5. The forces in elements 2 and 3 
can be obtained in a manner similar to that used to obtain Eq. (5.2.11) for the nodal forces

EXAMPLE 5.2
To illustrate the procedure for solving frames subjected to distributed loads, solve the rigid 
plane frame shown in Figure 5–6. The frame is fixed at nodes 1 and 3 and subjected to 
a uniformly distributed load of 13 kN/m applied downward over element 2. The global-­
coordinate axes have been established at node 1. The element lengths are shown in the ­figure.

SOLUTION:
We begin by replacing the distributed load acting on element 2 by nodal forces and moments 
acting at nodes 2 and 3. Using Eqs. (4.4.5)–(4.4.7) (or Appendix D), the equivalent nodal 
forces and moments are calculated as

5.2  Rigid Plane Frame Examples
253
Using Eqs. (5.2.23) and (5.2.29) for the local forces in each element, we can ­construct 
the free-body diagram for each element, as shown in Figure 5–7. From the free-body 
­diagrams, one can confirm the equilibrium of each element, the total frame, and joint 2 as 
desired.
In Example 5.3, we will illustrate the equivalent joint force replacement method for a 
frame subjected to a load acting on an element instead of at one of the joints of the structure. 
Since no distributed loads are present, the point of application of the concentrated load could 
be treated as an extra joint in the analysis, and we could solve the problem in the same manner 
as Example 5.1.
This approach has the disadvantage of increasing the total number of joints, as well as the 
size of the total structure stiffness matrix [K ]. For small structures solved by computer, this 
does not pose a problem. However, for very large structures, this might reduce the maximum 
size of the structure that could be analyzed. Certainly, this additional node greatly increases 
the longhand solution time for the structure. Hence, we will illustrate a standard procedure 
based on the concept of equivalent joint forces applied to the case of concentrated loads. We

Solve the frame shown in Figure 5–8(a). The frame consists of the three elements shown and 
is subjected to a 65-kN horizontal load applied at midlength of element 1. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 
are fixed, and the dimensions are shown in the figure. Let E 5 200 GPa, I 5

2 for all elements.
SOLUTION:
	1.	
We first express the applied load in the element 1 local coordinate system (here x9 is 
directed from node 1 to node 4). This is shown in Figure 5–8(b).
	2.	
Next, we determine the equivalent joint forces f
{ }
0  at each end of element 1, using the 
table in Appendix D. (These forces are of opposite sign from what are traditionally 
known as fixed-end forces in classical structural analysis theory [1].) These equivalent 
forces (and moments) are shown in Figure 5–8(c).

Free-body diagrams of all elements are shown in Figure 5–9. Each element has been deter-
mined to be in equilibrium, as often occurs even if errors are made in the longhand calcula-
tions. However, equilibrium at node 4 and equilibrium of the whole frame are also satisfied. 
For instance, using the results of Eqs. (5.2.38) through (5.2.40) to check equilibrium at

	 5.4 	 Grid Equations
A grid is a structure on which loads are applied perpendicular to the plane of the structure, 
as opposed to a plane frame, where loads are applied in the plane of the structure. We will 
now develop the grid element stiffness matrix. The elements of a grid are assumed to be 
rigidly connected, so that the original angles between elements connected together at a node 
remain unchanged. Both torsional and bending moment continuity then exist at the node point 
of a grid. Examples of grids include floor and bridge deck systems. A typical grid structure 
subjected to loads F1, F2, F3, and F4 is shown in Figure 5–13.

5.4  Grid Equations
263
We will now consider the development of the grid element stiffness matrix and element 
equations. A representative grid element with the nodal degrees of freedom and nodal forces is 
shown in Figure 5–14. The degrees of freedom at each node for a grid are a vertical deflection 
vi9  (normal to the grid), a torsional rotation 
ix
f9  about the x9 axis, and a bending rotation 
iz
f9  
about the z9 axis. Any effect of axial displacement is ignored; that is, ui9 5 0. The nodal forces 
consist of a transverse force fiy9, a torsional moment mix9  about the x9 axis, and a bending moment 
miz9  about the z9 axis. Grid elements do not resist axial loading; that is fix9 5 0.
To develop the local stiffness matrix for a grid element, we need to include the torsional 
effects in the basic beam element stiffness matrix Eq. (4.1.14). Recall that Eq. (4.1.14) already 
accounts for the bending and shear effects.
We can derive the torsional bar element stiffness matrix in a manner analogous to that used 
for the axial bar element stiffness matrix in Chapter 3. In the derivation, we simply replace fix9  
with mix9 , ui9  with 
ix
f9 , E with G (the shear modulus), A with J (the torsional constant, or stiffness 
factor), s  with τ (shear stress), and « with g (shear strain).
The actual derivation is briefly presented as follows. We assume a circular cross section 
with radius R for simplicity but without loss of generalization.
Step 1
Figure 5–15 shows the sign conventions for nodal torque and angle of twist and for element 
torque.
Step 2
We assume a linear angle-of-twist variation along the x9 axis of the bar such that

The cross sections of various structures, such as bridge decks, are often not circular. 
However, Eqs. (5.4.13) and (5.4.14) are still general; to apply them to other cross sections, 
we simply evaluate the torsional constant J for the particular cross section. For instance, for 
cross sections made up of thin rectangular shapes such as channels, angles, or I shapes, we 
approximate J by
	
∑
J
b ti i
5
1
3
3	
(5.4.15)
where bi is the length of any element of the cross section and ti is the thickness of any element 
of the cross section. In Table 5–1, we list values of J for various common cross sections. 
The first four cross sections are called open sections. Equation (5.4.15) applies only to these 
open cross sections. (For more information on the J concept, consult References [2] and [3], 
and for an extensive table of torsional constants for various cross-sectional shapes, consult 
Reference [4].) We assume the loading to go through the shear center of these open cross 
sections in order to prevent twisting of the cross section. For more on the shear center consult 
References [2] and [5].
On combining the torsional effects of Eq. (5.4.13) with the shear and bending effects of 
Eq. (4.1.13), we obtain the local stiffness matrix equation for a grid element as

Now that we have formulated the global stiffness matrix for the grid element, the proce-
dure for solution then follows in the same manner as that for the plane frame.
To illustrate the use of the equations developed in Section 5.4, we will now solve the 
following grid structures.
EXAMPLE 5.5
Analyze the grid shown in Figure 5–18. The grid consists of three elements, is fixed at 
nodes 2, 3, and 4, and is subjected to a downward vertical force (perpendicular to the x–z 
plane passing through the grid elements) of 400 kN. The global-coordinate axes have been 
established at node 3, and the element lengths are shown in the figure. Let

SOLUTION:
Substituting Eq. (5.4.17) for the local stiffness matrix and Eq. (5.4.18) for the transformation 
matrix into Eq. (5.4.19), we can obtain each element global stiffness matrix. To expedite the 
longhand solution, the boundary conditions at nodes 2, 3, and 4

Based on the downward loading location with respect to the supports, these results are 
expected.
Having solved for the unknown displacement and the rotations, we can obtain the local 
element forces on formulating the element equations in a manner similar to that for the beam

Free-body diagrams for all elements are shown in Figure 5–19. Each element is in equilib-

the y9 axis coincides with the global y axis, and the z9 axis is perpendicular to the x y

To verify equilibrium of node 1, we draw a free-body diagram of the node show-

In Figure 5–20, the local forces and moments from each element have been transformed

	 5.5 	 Beam Element Arbitrarily Oriented in Space
In this section, we develop the stiffness matrix for the beam element arbitrarily oriented 
in space, or three dimensions. This element can then be used to analyze frames in three-­
dimensional space.
First we consider bending about two axes, as shown in Figure 5–23.
We establish the following sign convention for the axes. Now we choose positive x9 from 
node 1 to 2. Then y9 is the principal axis for which the moment of inertia is minimum, Iy. By 
the right-hand rule we establish z9, and the maximum moment of inertia is Iz.

Two exceptions arise when local and global axes have special orientations with respect to

the global z axis and the y9 axis becomes uncertain, as shown in Figure 5–26(a). In this case the

SOLUTION:
Use Eq. (5.5.4) to obtain the global stiffness matrix for each element. This requires us to first 
use Eq. (5.5.3) to obtain each local stiffness matrix, Eq. (5.5.5) to obtain the transformation 
matrix for each element, and Eqs. (5.5.6) and (5.5.14) to obtain the direction cosine matrix 
for each element.

We establish the local x9 axis from node 3 to node 1 as shown in Figure 5–28. We note that 
the local x9 axis coincides with the global z axis. Therefore, by Eq. (5.5.15), we obtain

same as for element 1. However, we must remember that the degrees of freedom are for 
node 3 and then node 1.
Using Eq. (5.5.30) in Eq. (5.5.5), we obtain the transformation matrix as follows:

5.5  Beam Element Arbitrarily Oriented in Space
291
The element 3 properties are identical to the element 1 properties; therefore, the local 
stiffness matrix is identical to the one in Eq. (5.5.27). We must remember that the degrees 
of freedom are now in the order node 4 and then node 1.
Using Eq. (5.5.37) in Eq. (5.5.4), we obtain the global stiffness matrix for element 3 as

Applying the boundary conditions that displacements in the x, y, and z directions are all zero 
at nodes 2, 3, and 4, and rotations about the x, y, and z axes are all zero at nodes 2, 3, and 4,  
we obtain the reduced global stiffness matrix. Also, the applied global force is directed in the 
negative y direction at node 1 and so expressed as F y 5 2200
1
 kN, and the global moment 
about the x axis at node 1 is M x 5 2100
1
 kN-m.
With these considerations, the final global equations are

We can verify equilibrium of node 1 by considering the node 1 forces and moments from 
each element that transfer to the node. We use the results from Eqs. (5.5.41), (5.5.42), and 
(5.5.43) to establish the proper forces and moments transferred to node 1. (Note that based 
on Newton’s third law, the opposite forces and moments from each element are sent to 
node 1.) For instance, we observe from summing forces in the global y direction (shown in 
the diagram that follows)

(5.5.44)
In Eq. (5.5.44), 1.299 kN is from the element 1 local y9 force that is coincident with the 
global y direction; 30.87 kN is from the element 2 local y9 force that is coincident with the 
global y direction, while 167.85 kN is from the element 3 local x9 direction that is coincident 
with the global y direction. We observe these axes from Figure 5–28. Verification of the 
other equilibrium equations is left to your discretion.
An example using the frame element in three-dimensional space is shown in Figure 5–29. 
Figure 5–29 shows a bus frame subjected to a static roof-crush analysis. In this model, 599 
frame elements and 357 nodes were used. A total downward load of 100 kN was uniformly 
spread over the 56 nodes of the roof portion of the frame. Figure 5–30 shows the rear of the 
frame and the displaced view of the rear frame. Other frame models with additional loads 
simulating rollover and front-end collisions were studied in Reference [6].

5.6  Concept of Substructure Analysis
295
	 5.6 	 Concept of Substructure Analysis
The problem of exceeding memory capacity on today’s personal computers has decreased sig-
nificantly for most applications. However, for those structures that are too large to be analyzed 
as a single system or treated as a whole—that is, the final stiffness matrix and equations for 
solution exceed the memory capacity of the computer—the concept of substructure analysis 
can be used. The procedure to overcome this problem is to separate the whole structure into 
smaller units called substructures. For example, the space frame of an airplane, as shown in 
Figure 5–31(a), may require thousands of nodes and elements to model and describe com-
pletely the response of the whole structure. If we separate the aircraft into substructures, such 
as parts of the fuselage or body, wing sections, and so on, as shown in Figure 5–31(b), then we 
can solve the problem more readily and on computers with limited memory.
The analysis of the airplane frame is performed by treating each substructure separately while 
ensuring force and displacement compatibility at the intersections where partitioning occurs.
To describe the procedure of substructuring, consider the rigid frame shown in ­Figure 5–32 
(even though this frame could be analyzed as a whole). First we define individual ­separate 
substructures. Normally, we make these substructures of similar size, and to reduce computa-
tions, we make as few cuts as possible. We then separate the frame into three parts, A, B, and C.

We now analyze a typical substructure B shown in Figure 5–32(b). This substructure 
includes the beams at the top (a-a), but the beams at the bottom (b-b) are included in substruc-
ture A, although the beams at top could be included in substructure C and the beams at the 
bottom could be included in substructure B.
The force/displacement equations for substructure B are partitioned with the interface 
displacements and forces separated from the interior ones as follows:

That is, the interface displacements at the common locations where cuts were made must be 
the same.
The response of the whole structure can now be obtained by direct superposition of Eqs. 
(5.6.7), (5.6.9), and (5.6.10), where now the final equations are expressed in terms of the inter-
face displacements at the eight interface nodes only [Figure 5–32(b)] as

The solution of Eq. (5.6.12) gives the displacements at the interface nodes. To obtain the 
displacements within each substructure, we use the force-displacement Eqs. (5.6.4) for deB
{
} 
with similar equations for substructures A and C. Example 5.9 illustrates the concept of sub-
structure analysis. In order to solve by hand, a relatively simple structure is used.

Solve for the displacement and rotation at node 3 for the beam in Figure 5–33 by using 
substructuring. Let E 5 200 GPa and I 5

SOLUTION:
To illustrate the substructuring concept, we divide the beam into two substructures, labeled 
1 and 2 in Figure 5–34. The 45 kN force has been assigned to node 3 of substructure 2, 
although it could have been assigned to either substructure or a fraction of it assigned to 
each substructure.

We could now return to Eq. (5.6.15) or Eq. (5.6.16) to obtain v2 and f2 and to 
Eq. (5.6.19) to obtain v4 and f4.
We emphasize that this example is used as a simple illustration of substructuring and is 
not typical of the size of problems where substructuring is normally performed. Generally, 
substructuring is used when the number of degrees of freedom is very large, as might occur, 
for instance, for very large structures such as the airframe in Figure 5–31.

be a plane frame with rigid joints, and analyze using a frame element. Then assume 
the structure to be pin-jointed and analyze as a plane truss, using a truss element. If 
the structure is actually a truss, is it appropriate to model it as a rigid frame?

Select a mild steel and choose suitable cross-sectional shapes with no more than a 
4 : 1 ratio of moments of inertia between the two principal directions of the cross 
section. You may choose two different cross sections to make up each arm to reduce 
weight. The actual structure has four support arms, but the loads shown are for one 
side of the platform with the two arms shown. The loads shown are under operating 
conditions. Use a factor of safety of 2 for human safety. In developing the finite 
element model, remove the platform and replace it with statically equivalent loads 
at the joints at B and D. Use truss elements or beam elements with low bending 
stiffness to model the arms from B to D, the intermediate connection E to F, and 
the hydraulic actuator. The allowable stresses are

joint at B between the upright and the horizontal beam is best modeled with end 
release of the end node of the top element on the upright member. The allowable

device location. Note that this beam is on one side of the crane. Assume you are 
using ASTM A36 structural steel. The crane must be 3.6 m long, 2.4 m wide, 
and 4.5 m high. The beams should all be the same size, the columns all the same 
size, and the bracing all the same size. The corner bracing can be wide flange 
sections or some other common shape. You must verify that the structure is safe 
by checking the beam’s bending strength and allowable deflection, the column’s 
buckling strength, and the bracing’s buckling strength. Use a factor of safety 
against material yielding of the beams of 5. Verify that the beam deflection is less

columns and the bracing. Use a factor of safety against buckling of 5. Assume 
the column-to-beam joints to be rigid while the bracing (a total of eight braces) 
is pinned to the column and beam at each of the four corners. Also assume the

the frame. (By Matthew Groshek)
	P5.77	
	 A motorcycle frame is shown in Figure P 5–77. The loads and boundary conditions 
are shown in the figure. The nodal coordinates are listed below to assist in building 
the model. Determine a suitable cross section and material based on a maximum 
von Mises stress equal to one-third of the yield strength of the material you select. 
Also, what is the maximum displacement, and where is it located on the frame?

	 A hunting stand is shown in Figure P 5–79. The coordinates of all nodes are also 
listed. Two 1.25 kN forces are applied to the top of the platform at the two center 
most nodes as shown. The frame is rated for 2.5kN of force. Determine a standard 
suitable square tube of steel or aluminum based on a factor of safety of 2 against 
yielding of the material. (By Sam Hanson)

Introduction
In Chapters 2 through 5, we considered only line elements. Two or more line elements are 
connected only at common nodes, forming framed or articulated structures such as trusses, 
frames, and grids. Line elements have geometric properties such as cross-sectional area and 
moment of inertia associated with their cross sections. However, only one local coordinate x 
along the length of the element is required to describe a position along the element (hence, they 
are called line elements or one-dimensional elements). Nodal compatibility is then enforced 
during the formulation of the nodal equilibrium equations for a line element.
This chapter considers the two-dimensional finite element. Two-dimensional (planar) 
elements are defined by three or more nodes in a two-dimensional plane (that is, x – y). The 
elements are connected at common nodes and/or along common edges to form continuous 
structures such as those shown in Figures 1–3, 1–4, 1–6, 6–2a, and 6–6(b). Nodal displacement 
compatibility is then enforced during the formulation of the nodal equilibrium equations for 
two-dimensional elements. If proper displacement functions are chosen, compatibility along 
common edges is also obtained.
The two-dimensional element is extremely important for (1) plane stress analysis, which 
includes problems such as plates with holes, fillets, or other changes in geometry that are 
loaded in their plane resulting in local stress concentrations, as illustrated in Figure 6–1; and (2)

plane strain analysis, which includes problems such as a long underground box culvert sub-
jected to a uniform load acting constantly over its length, as illustrated in Figure 1–3, a long, 
cylindrical control rod subjected to a load that remains constant over the rod length (or depth), 
as illustrated in Figure 1–4, and dams and pipes subjected to loads that remain constant over 
their lengths, as shown in Figure 6–2.
We begin this chapter with the development of the stiffness matrix for a basic two-­
dimensional or plane finite element, called the constant-strain triangular element. We consider 
the constant-strain triangle (CST) stiffness matrix because its derivation is the simplest among 
the available two-dimensional elements. The element is called a CST because it has a constant 
strain throughout it.
We will derive the CST stiffness matrix by using the principle of minimum potential 
energy because the energy formulation is the most feasible for the development of the equations 
for both two- and three-dimensional finite elements.
We will then present a simple, thin-plate plane stress example problem to illustrate the 
assemblage of the plane element stiffness matrices using the direct stiffness method as pre-
sented in Chapter 2. We will present the total solution, including the stresses within the plate.
Finally, we will develop the stiffness matrix for the simple four-noded rectangular (Q4) 
element and compare the finite element solution to a beam bending problem modeled using 
the CST and Q4 elements.
	 6.1 	 Basic Concepts of Plane Stress and Plane Strain
In this section, we will describe the concepts of plane stress and plane strain. These concepts 
are important because the developments in this chapter are directly applicable only to systems 
assumed to behave in a plane stress or plane strain manner. Therefore, we will now describe 
these concepts in detail.
Plane Stress
Plane stress is defined to be a state of stress in which the normal stress and the shear stresses 
directed perpendicular to the plane are assumed to be zero. For instance, in Figures 6–1(a) 
and 6–1(b), the plates in the x – y plane shown subjected to surface tractions T (pressure acting 
on the surface edge or face of a member in units of force/area) in the plane are under a state 
of plane stress; that is, the normal stress 
z
s  and the shear stresses xz
τ  and yz
τ  are assumed to 
be zero. Generally, members that are thin (those with a small z dimension compared to the 
in-plane x and y dimensions) and whose loads act only in the x – y plane can be considered to 
be under plane stress.
Plane Strain
Plane strain is defined to be a state of strain in which the strain normal to the x – y plane z
«  
and the shear strains xz
g  and 
yz
gg
 are assumed to be zero. The assumptions of plane strain are 
realistic for long bodies (say, in the z direction) with constant cross-sectional area subjected to 
loads that act only in the x and/or y directions and do not vary in the z direction. Some plane 
strain examples are shown in Figure 6–2 [and in Figures 1–4 (a long underground box culvert)

and 1–4 (a hydraulic cylinder rod end)]. In these examples, only a unit thickness (1 mm or 1 m)  
of the structure is considered because each unit thickness behaves identically (except near 
the ends). The finite element models of the structures in Figure 6–2 consist of appropriately 
discretized cross sections in the x – y plane with the loads acting over unit thicknesses in the 
x and/or y directions only.
Two-Dimensional State of Stress and Strain
The concept of a two-dimensional state of stress and strain and the stress/strain relationships 
for plane stress and plane strain are necessary to understand fully the development and appli-
cability of the stiffness matrix for the plane stress/plane strain triangular element. Therefore, 
we briefly outline the essential concepts of two-dimensional stress and strain (see References 
[1] and [2] and Appendix C for more details on this subject).
First, we illustrate the two-dimensional state of stress using Figure 6–3. The infinitesimal 
element with sides dx and dy has normal stresses 
x
s  and 
y
s  acting in the x and y directions 
(here on the vertical and horizontal faces), respectively. The shear stress xy
τ  acts on the x edge 
(vertical face) in the y direction. The shear stress yx
τ
 acts on the y edge (horizontal face) in the 
x direction. Moment equilibrium of the element results in xy
τ  being equal in magnitude to yx
τ
. 
See Appendix C.1 for proof of this equality. Hence, three independent stresses exist and are 
represented by the vector column matrix

The element equilibrium equations are derived in Appendix C.1.
The stresses given by Eq. (6.1.1) will be expressed in terms of the nodal displacement 
degrees of freedom. Hence, once the nodal displacements are determined, these stresses can 
be evaluated directly.
Recall from strength of materials [2] that the principal stresses, which are the maximum 
and minimum normal stresses in the two-dimensional plane, can be obtained from the follow-
ing expressions:

Appendix C.2 shows a detailed derivation of Eqs. (6.1.4). Hence, recall that the strains x
«  and 
y
«  are the changes in length per unit length of material fibers originally parallel to the x and 
y axes, respectively, when the element undergoes deformation. These strains are then called 
normal (or extensional or longitudinal) strains. The strain 
xy
g  is the change in the original 
right angle made between dx and dy when the element undergoes deformation. The strain xy
g  
is then called a shear strain.

To illustrate the steps and introduce the basic equations necessary for the plane triangular 
element, consider the thin plate subjected to tensile surface traction loads TS in Figure 6–6(a).

6.2  Derivation of the Constant-Strain Triangular Element Stiffness Matrix and Equations 
343
Step 1 Select Element Type
To analyze the plate, we consider the basic triangular element in Figure 6–7 taken from the 
discretized plate, as shown in Figure 6–6(b). The discretized plate has been divided into tri-
angular elements, each with nodes such as i, j, and m. We use triangular elements because 
boundaries of irregularly shaped bodies can be closely approximated in this way, and because 
the expressions related to the triangular element are comparatively simple. This discretization 
is called a coarse-mesh generation if a few large elements are used. Each node has two degrees 
of freedom—an x and a y displacement. We will let ui and vi represent the node i displacement 
components in the x and y directions, respectively.
Here all formulations are based on this counterclockwise system of labeling of nodes, 
although a formulation based on a clockwise system of labeling could be used. Remember 
that a consistent labeling procedure for the whole body is necessary to avoid problems in the 
calculations such as negative element areas. Here x y

) of the element.
The linear function ensures that compatibility will be satisfied. A linear function with 
specified endpoints has only one path through which to pass—that is, through the two points. 
Hence, the linear function ensures that the displacements along the edge and at the nodes shared 
by adjacent elements, such as edge i-j of the two elements shown in Figure 6–6(b), are equal. 
Using Eqs. (6.2.2), the general displacement function c
{ }, which stores the functions u and v, 
can be expressed as

We have now expressed the general displacements as functions of {d}, in terms of the 
shape functions Ni, N j, and Nm. The shape functions represent the shape of c

over the surface of a typical element. For instance, Ni represents the shape of the variable

equal to zero; that is, u

5 1 for all x and y locations on the surface of the element so that 
u and v will yield a constant value when rigid-body displacement occurs. The proof of this 
relationship follows that given for the bar element in Section 3.2 and is left as an exercise 
(Problem 6.1). The shape functions are also used to determine the body and surface forces at 
element nodes, as described in Section 6.3.
The requirement of completeness for the constant-strain triangle element used in a two-­
dimensional plane stress element is illustrated in Figure 6–9. The element must be able to 
translate uniformly in either the x or y direction in the plane and to rotate without straining 
as shown in Figure 6–9(a). The reason that the element must be able to translate as a rigid 
body and to rotate stress-free is illustrated in the example of a cantilever beam modeled with 
plane stress elements as shown in Figure 6–9(b). By simple statics, the beam elements beyond 
the loading are stress free. Hence these elements must be free to translate and rotate without 
stretching or changing shape.

6.2  Derivation of the Constant-Strain Triangular Element Stiffness Matrix and Equations

We observe from Eq. (6.2.23b) that the strains in the element are constant. The element is then 
called a constant-strain triangle (CST). It should be also noted that based on the assumption 
of choosing displacement functions that are linear in x and y, all lines in the triangle element 
remain straight as the element deforms.

The [B] matrix (sometimes called a gradient matrix) is independent of the x and y coordinates. 
It depends solely on the element nodal coordinates, as seen from Eqs. (6.2.32) and (6.2.10). 
The strains in Eq. (6.2.33) will be constant (consistent with the simple expressions previously 
given by Eq. (6.2.23b).

where [D] is given by Eq. (6.1.8) for plane stress problems and by Eq. (6.1.10) for plane strain

Step 4 Derive the Element Stiffness Matrix and Equations
Using the principle of minimum potential energy1, we can generate the equations for a typical 
constant-strain triangular element. Keep in mind that for the basic plane stress element, the 
total potential energy is now a function of the nodal displacements ui, vi, uj, …, vm (that is, 
{d}) such that

1For one with an understanding of variational calculus, it might be appropriate to mention that the standard finite element 
method displacement formulation, based on taking the variation of the total potential energy, inherently enforces the fact that 
internal equilibrium and stress boundary conditions are enforced in an average or integral sense rather than point by point. 
In the literature, the formal mathematical basis of the finite element method is called the weak form of the finite element 
formulation. This is in opposition to the strong form where all the governing stress differential equations plus the boundary 
conditions are stated and satisfied point by point.
Furthermore, the terminology of weak form versus strong form should not imply weakness of the weak form as both forms are 
valid statements of a problem, such as the plane stress one. In fact, it can be shown that the weak form leads to the strong form 
when infinitely many degrees of freedom are approached. For a more in-depth treatment of strong versus weak form, consult [3].

6.2  Derivation of the Constant-Strain Triangular Element Stiffness Matrix and Equations 
353
where A is given by Eq. (6.2.9), [B] is given by Eq. (6.2.34), and [D] is given by Eq. (6.1.8) or 
Eq. (6.1.10). We will assume elements of constant thickness. (This assumption is convergent 
to the actual situation as the element size is decreased.)
From Eq. (6.2.52) we see that [k] is a function of the nodal coordinates (because [B] and 
A are defined in terms of them) and of the mechanical properties E and v (of which [D] is a 
function). The expansion of Eq. (6.2.52) for an element is

and so forth. In Eqs. (6.2.54), Bi
[
], Bj
[
], and Bm
[
] are defined by Eqs. (6.2.32). The [k] matrix 
is seen to be a 3
6
6 matrix (equal in order to the number of degrees of freedom per node, two, 
times the total number of nodes per element, three).
In general, Eq. (6.2.46) must be used to evaluate the surface and body forces. When Eq. 
(6.2.46) is used to evaluate the surface and body forces, these forces are called consistent loads 
because they are derived from the consistent (energy) approach. For higher-order elements, 
typically with quadratic or cubic displacement functions, Eq. (6.2.46) should be used. However, 
for the CST element, the body and surface forces can be lumped at the nodes with equivalent 
results (this is illustrated in Section 6.3) and added to any concentrated nodal forces to obtain 
the element force matrix. The element equations are then given by

is the column of equivalent global nodal loads obtained by lumping body forces and distributed 
loads at the proper nodes (as well as including concentrated nodal loads) or by consistently 
using Eq. (6.2.46). (Further details regarding the treatment of body forces and surface tractions 
will be given in Section 6.3.)
In the formulation of the element stiffness matrix Eq. (6.2.52), the matrix has been derived 
for a general orientation in global coordinates. Equation (6.2.52) then applies for all elements. 
All element matrices are expressed in the global-coordinate orientation. Therefore, no trans-
formation from local to global equations is necessary. However, for completeness, we will now 
describe the method to use if the local axes for the constant-strain triangular element are not 
parallel to the global axes for the whole structure.
If the local axes for the constant-strain triangular element are not parallel to the global 
axes for the whole structure, we must apply rotation-of-axes transformations similar to those 
introduced in Chapter 3 by Eq. (3.3.16) to the element stiffness matrix, as well as to the element 
nodal force and displacement matrices. We illustrate the transformation of axes for the triangu-
lar element shown in Figure 6–10, considering the element to have local axes 9
9

y
–
 not parallel 
to global axes x – y. Local nodal forces are shown in the figure. The transformation from local 
to global equations follows the procedure outlined in Section 3.4. We have the same general 
expressions, Eqs. (3.4.14), (3.4.16), and (3.4.22), to relate local to global displacements, forces, 
and stiffness matrices, respectively; that is,

(6.2.59)
where Eq. (3.4.15) for the transformation matrix [T] used in Eqs. (6.2.59) must be expanded 
because two additional degrees of freedom are present in the constant-strain triangular element. 
Thus, Eq. (3.4.15) is expanded to

Step 6 Solve for the Nodal Displacements
We determine the unknown global structure nodal displacements by solving the system of 
algebraic equations given by Eq. (6.2.57).
Step 7 Solve for the Element Forces (Stresses)
Having solved for the nodal displacements, we obtain the strains and stresses in the global 
x and y directions in the elements by using Eqs. (6.2.33) and (6.2.36). Finally, we deter-
mine the maximum and minimum in-plane principal stresses s1 and s2 by using the trans-
formation Eqs. (6.1.2), where these stresses are usually assumed to act at the centroid of 
the element. The angle that one of the principal stresses makes with the x axis is given by  
Eq. (6.1.3).

and Xb and Yb are the weight densities in the x and y directions in units of force/unit volume, 
respectively. These forces may arise, for instance, because of actual body weight (gravitational 
forces), angular velocity (called centrifugal body forces, as described in Chapter 9), or inertial 
forces in dynamics.
In Eq. (6.3.1), [N] is a linear function of x and y; therefore, the integration must be carried 
out. Without lack of generality, the integration is simplified if the origin of the coordinates 
is chosen at the centroid of the element. For example, consider the element with coordinates 
shown in Figure 6–12. With the origin of the coordinate placed at the centroid of the element, 
we have, from the definition of the centroid,

in three equal parts. The signs depend on the directions of Xb and Yb with respect to the positive 
x and y global coordinates. For the case of body weight only, because of the gravitational force 
associated with the y direction, we have only Y

Figure 6–15 illustrates the results for the surface load equivalent nodal forces for both 
­elements 1 and 2.
We can conclude that for a constant-strain triangle, a distributed load on an ele-
ment edge can be treated as concentrated loads acting at the nodes associated with the 
loaded edge by making the two kinds of load statically equivalent [which is equivalent to

applying Eq. (6.3.7)]. However, for higher-order elements such as the linear-strain triangle 
(­discussed in Chapter 8), the load replacement should be made by using Eq. (6.3.7), which 
was derived by the principle of minimum potential energy. For higher-order elements, this 
load replacement by use of Eq. (6.3.7) is generally not equal to the apparent statically 
equivalent one; however, it is consistent in that this replacement results directly from the 
energy approach.
We now recognize the force matrix fs
{ } defined by Eq. (6.3.7), and based on the principle 
of minimum potential energy, to be equivalent to that based on work equivalence, which we 
previously used in Chapter 4 when discussing distributed loads acting on beams.
	 6.4 	 Explicit Expression for the Constant-Strain  
Triangle Stiffness Matrix
Although the stiffness matrix is generally formulated internally in most computer programs 
by performing the matrix triple product indicated by Eq. (6.4.1), it is still a valuable learning 
experience to evaluate the stiffness matrix explicitly for the constant-strain triangular element. 
Hence, we will consider the plane strain case specifically in this development.
First, recall that the stiffness matrix is given by

On multiplying the matrices in Eq. (6.4.2), we obtain Eq. (6.4.3), the explicit ­constant-strain

Finally, it should be noted that for Poisson’s ratio ν approaching 0.5, as in rubber-like 
materials and plastic solids, for instance, a material becomes incompressible [2]. For plane 
strain, as ν approaches 0.5, the denominator becomes zero in the material property matrix [see 
Eq. (6.1.10)] and hence in the stiffness matrix, Eq. (6.4.3). A value of ν near 0.5 can cause 
ill-conditioned structural equations. A special formulation (called a penalty formulation [3]) 
has been used in this case.

solution.

SOLUTION:
Discretization
To illustrate the finite element method solution for the plate, we first discretize the plate 
into two elements, as shown in Figure 6–17. It should be understood that the coarseness 
of the mesh will not yield as true a predicted behavior of the plate as would a finer mesh, 
particularly near the fixed edge. However, since we are performing a longhand solution, we 
will use a coarse discretization for simplicity (but without loss of generality of the method).
In Figure 6–17, the original tensile surface traction in Figure 6–16 has been converted 
to nodal forces as follows:

In general, for higher-order elements, Eq. (6.3.7) should be used to convert distributed sur-
face tractions to nodal forces. However, for the CST element, we have shown in Section 6.3 
that a statically equivalent force replacement can be used directly, as has been done here.

for a one-dimensional bar subjected to tensile force. Hence, the nodal x displacement com-
ponents of Eq. (6.5.27) for the two-dimensional plate appear to be reasonably correct, con-
sidering the coarseness of the mesh and the directional stiffness bias of the model. (For more 
on this subject see Section 7.5.) The y displacement would be expected to be downward at 
the top (node 3) and upward at the bottom (node 4) as a result of the Poisson effect. However, 
the directional stiffness bias due to the coarse mesh accounts for this unexpected poor result.

Owing to the uniform stress of 7 MPa acting only in the x direction on the edge of the 
plate, we would expect the stress 
x
s
s
5
(
)
1  to be near 7 MPa in each element. Thus, the 
results from Eqs. (6.5.31) and (6.5.34) for 
x
s  are quite good. We would expect the stress 
y
s  to be very small (at least near the free edge). The restraint of element 1 at nodes 1 and 
2 causes a relatively large element stress 
y
s , whereas the restraint of element 2 at only one 
node causes a very small stress 
y
s . The shear stresses xy
τ  remain close to zero, as expected. 
Had the number of elements been increased, with smaller ones used near the support edge, 
even more realistic results would have been obtained. However, a finer discretization would 
result in a cumbersome longhand solution and thus was not used here. Use of a computer 
program is recommended for a detailed solution to this plate problem and certainly for 
solving more complex stress/strain problems.
The maximum distortion energy theory [4] (also called the von Mises or von Mises-Hencky 
theory) for ductile materials subjected to static loading predicts that a material will fail if the 
von Mises stress (also called equivalent or effective stress) reaches the yield strength, Sy, of 
the material. The von Mises stress as derived in [4], for instance, is given in terms of the three 
principal stresses by

Thus for yielding to occur, the von Mises stress must become equal to or greater than the yield 
strength of the material as given by
	
vm
Sy
s
$
	
(6.5.38)
We can see from Eqs. (6.5.37a or 6.5.37b) that the von Mises stress is a scalar that measures 
the intensity of the entire stress state as it includes the three principal stresses or the three nor-
mal stresses in the x, y, and z directions, along with the shear stresses on the x, y, and z planes. 
Other stresses, such as the maximum principal one, do not provide the most accurate way of 
predicting failure.
Most computer programs incorporate this failure theory and, as an optional result, the 
user can request a plot of the von Mises stress throughout the material model being analyzed. 
If the von Mises stress value is equal to or greater than the yield strength of the material being 
considered, then another material with greater yield strength can be selected or other design 
changes can be made.

6  |  Development of the Plane Stress and Plane Strain Stiffness Equations

For brittle materials, such as glass and cast iron, with different tension and compression 
properties, it is recommended to use the Coulomb-Mohr theory to predict failure. For more on 
this theory consult [4].
	 6.6 	 Rectangular Plane Element (Bilinear Rectangle, Q4)
We will now develop the four-noded rectangular plane element stiffness matrix. We will later 
refer to this element in the isoparametric formulation of a general quadrilateral element in 
Section 10.2. This element is also called the bilinear rectangle because of the linear terms in x 
and y for the x and y displacement functions shown in Eq. (6.6.2). The “Q4” symbol represents 
the element as a quadrilateral with four corner nodes.
Two advantages of the rectangular element over the triangular element are ease of data 
input and simpler interpretation of output stresses. A disadvantage of the rectangular element 
is that the simple linear-displacement rectangle with its associated straight sides poorly approx-
imates the real boundary condition edges.
The usual steps outlined in Chapter 1 will be followed to obtain the element stiffness 
matrix and related equations.
Step 1 Select Element Type
Consider the rectangular element shown in Figure 6–20 (all interior angles are 
8
90 ) with cor-
ner nodes 1–4 (again labeled counterclockwise) and base and height dimensions 2b and 2h, 
respectively.
The unknown nodal displacements are now given by

Step 2 Select Displacement Functions
For a compatible displacement field, the element displacement functions u and v must be linear

From Eqs. (6.6.7b), (6.6.8), and (6.6.9), we observe that x
«  is a function of y, y
«  is a func-
tion of x, and xy
g  is a function of both x and y. The stresses are again given by the formulas in 
Eq. (6.2.36), where [B] is now that of Eq. (6.6.9) and {d} is that of Eq. (6.6.1).

Displacement Results
We observe from the displacement results that the CST element models produce stiffer models 
than the actual beam behavior, as the deflections are predicted to be smaller than classical beam 
theory predicts. We also observe that the CST model converges very slowly to the classical 
beam theory solution. This is partly due to the element predicting only constant stress within 
each element when for a bending problem; the stress actually varies linearly through the depth 
of the beam. This problem is rectified by using the linear-strain triangle (LST) element as 
described in Chapter 8.
Additional comparisons of CST and LST elements are given in Section 8.3. See Tables 8.1 
and 8.2 and Figure 8-6.
The results indicate that the Q4 compatible element model predicts more accurate 
deflection behavior than the CST element model. The two-row model of Q4 elements yields 
deflections approaching that predicted by the classical beam deflection equation, whereas the 
two-row model of CST elements is quite inaccurate in predicting the deflection. As the number 
of rows is increased to four and then eight, the deflections are predicted increasingly more 
accurately for the CST and Q4 element models. The two-noded beam element model gives 
the identical deflection as the classical equation

 as expected (see discussion in 
Section 4.5) and is the most appropriate model for this problem when you are not concerned, 
for instance, with stress concentrations.
As further shown in [3] for a beam subjected to pure bending, the CST has a spurious or 
false shear stress and hence a spurious shear strain in parts of the model that should not have 
any shear stress or shear strain. This spurious shear strain absorbs energy; therefore, some of 
the energy that should go into bending is lost. The CST is then too stiff in bending, and the 
resulting deformation is smaller than it actually should be. This phenomenon of excessive 
stiffness developing in one or more modes of deformation is sometimes described as shear 
locking or parasitic shear.
Furthermore, in problems where plane strain conditions exist (recall this means when 
z
« 5 0) and the Poisson’s ratio approaches 0.5, a mesh can actually lock, which means the 
mesh then cannot deform at all.
It should be noted that using a single row of Q4 elements with their linear edge dis-
placement is not recommended to accurately predict the stress gradient through the depth of 
the beam. This is illustrated in Figure 6–21, where for the pure bending state (approximated 
by this example), the exact displacement is shown in Figure 6–21(b), while the Q4 element 
displacement is shown in Figure 6–21(c), which is not capable of pure bending deformation.

Summary Equations
Stress Results
As mentioned previously, the CST element has constant strain and stress within it, while the Q4 
element normal strain, x
« , and hence the normal stress, 
x
s , is linear in the y direction. (Also see 
Eq. (6.6.7b). Therefore, the CST is not able to simulate the bending behavior nearly as well as the 
Q4 element. The classical beam theory/bending stress equation predicts a linear stress variation 
through the depth of the beam given by 
My I

—shown in Section 4.1 as well. As shown 
when comparing the tensor stresses for each model, as more rows are used, the stresses approach 
the classical bending stress of 19 MPa 0.05 m from the wall with the Q4 approaching the classical 
solution much faster as indicated by comparing the two-row solutions for Q4 and CST models.
Finally, the eight-noded quadratic edge displacement element (Q8) predicts bending 
behavior better than both the CST and Q4 elements. Thus, fewer Q8 elements can be used and 
faster convergence to the proper solution are obtained using this element. In fact, using even a 
single row of Q8 elements yields reasonable results in bending, as shown in [3]. Again, Section 
10.5 describes the Q8 element and comparison of the Q8 to the Q4 element for a cantilever 
beam model is given in Table 10.3.
This brief description of some of the limitations in using the CST and Q4 elements does 
not prevent us from using them to model plane stress and plane strain problems. It just requires 
us to use a fine mesh as opposed to a coarse one, particularly where bending occurs and where 
in general large stress gradients will result. Also, we must make sure our computer program 
can handle Poisson’s ratios that approach 0.5 (if that is desired, such as in rubber-like materi-
als). For common materials, such as metals, Poisson’s ratio is around 0.3, so locking should 
not be of concern.

Practical Considerations 
in Modeling; Interpreting 
Results; and Examples of 
Plane Stress/Strain Analysis
Chapter Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Present concepts that should be considered when modeling for a solution by 
the finite element method, such as aspect ratio, symmetry, natural subdivisions, 
sizing of elements and the h, p, and r methods of refinement, concentrated 
loads and infinite stress, infinite medium, and connecting different kinds of 
elements.
■ Describe some of the approximations inherent in finite element solutions.
■ Illustrate convergence of solution and introduce the patch test for convergence of 
solution.
■ Discuss the interpretation of stresses in an element, including a common method of 
averaging the nodal values (also called smoothing).
■ Present a flowchart of a typical finite element process used for the analysis of plane 
stress and plane strain.
■ Describe a computer assisted step-by-step solution of a bicycle wrench.
■ Demonstrate various real-world applications where plane stress/strain element 
models are applicable. Such examples include a bicycle wrench, a connecting rod 
with notch and hole stress concentrations, an irregularly shaped overload protection 
device, an adjustable wrench, and a beam welded to a column with surface contact 
elements to allow the separation of surface between beam and column during the 
beam flexing.
Introduction
In this chapter, we will describe some modeling guidelines, including generally recom-
mended mesh size, natural subdivisions modeling around concentrated loads, and more 
on use of symmetry and associated boundary conditions. This is followed by discussion of

equilibrium, compatibility, and convergence of solution. We will then consider interpretation 
of stress results.
We then show some computer program results. A computer program facilitates the 
solution of complex, large-number-of-degrees-of-freedom plane stress/plane strain prob-
lems that generally cannot be solved longhand because of the larger number of equations 
involved. Also, problems for which longhand solutions do not exist (such as those involv-
ing complex geometries and complex loads or where unrealistic, often gross, assumptions 
were previously made to simplify the problem to allow it to be described via a classical 
differential equation approach) can now be solved with a higher degree of confidence in 
the results by using the finite element approach (with its resulting system of algebraic 
equations).
	 7.1 	 Finite Element Modeling
We will now discuss various concepts that should be considered when modeling any problem 
for solution by the finite element method.
General Considerations
Finite element modeling is partly an art guided by visualizing physical interactions taking 
place within the body. One appears to acquire good modeling techniques through experience 
and by working with experienced people. General-purpose programs provide some guidelines 
for specific types of problems [12, 15]. In subsequent parts of this section, some significant 
concepts that should be considered are described.
In modeling, the user is first confronted with the sometimes difficult task of under-
standing the physical behavior taking place and understanding the physical behavior of 
the various elements available for use. Choosing the proper type of element or elements to 
match as closely as possible the physical behavior of the problem is one of the numerous 
decisions that must be made by the user. Understanding the boundary conditions imposed 
on the problem can, at times, be a difficult task. Also, it is often difficult to determine the 
kinds of loads that must be applied to a body and their magnitudes and locations. Again, 
working with more experienced users and searching the literature can help overcome these 
difficulties.
Aspect Ratio and Element Shapes
The aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the longest dimension to the shortest dimension 
of a quadrilateral element. In many cases, as the aspect ratio increases, the inaccuracy 
of the solution increases. To illustrate this point, Figure 7–1(a) shows five different finite 
element models used to analyze a beam subjected to bending. The element used here is

the rectangular one described in Section 6.6. Figure 7–1(b) is a plot of the resulting error 
in the displacement at point A of the beam versus the aspect ratio. Table 7–1 reports a 
comparison of results for the displacements at points A and B for the five models, and the 
exact solution [2].
There are exceptions for which aspect ratios approaching 50 still produce satisfactory 
results; for example, if the stress gradient is close to zero at some location of the actual prob-
lem, then large aspect ratios at that location still produce reasonable results.
In general, an element yields best results if its shape is compact and regular. Although dif-
ferent elements have different sensitivities to shape distortions, try to maintain (1) aspect ratios

Use of Symmetry
The appropriate use of symmetry* will often expedite the modeling of a problem. Use of sym-
metry allows us to consider a reduced problem instead of the actual problem. Thus, we can use 
a finer subdivision of elements with less labor and computer costs. For another discussion on 
the use of symmetry, see Reference [3].
Figures 7–3 through 7–5 illustrate the use of reflective or mirror symmetry in modeling a 
soil mass subjected to foundation loading, a uniaxially loaded member with a fillet, and a plate 
with a hole subjected to internal pressure, respectively. Note that at the plane of symmetry the 
displacement in the direction perpendicular to the plane must be equal to zero. This is modeled 
by the rollers at nodes 2–6 in Figure 7–3, where the plane of symmetry is the vertical plane 
passing through nodes 1–6, perpendicular to the plane of the model. In Figures 7–4(a) and 
7–5(a), there are two planes of symmetry. Thus, we need model only one-fourth of the actual 
members, as shown in Figures 7–4(b) and 7–5(b). Therefore, rollers are used at nodes along 
both the vertical and horizontal planes of symmetry.
As previously indicated in Chapter 3, in vibration and buckling problems, symmetry must 
be used with caution since symmetry in geometry does not imply symmetry in all vibration 
or buckling modes.
Natural Subdivisions at Discontinuities
Figure 7–6 illustrates various natural subdivisions for finite element discretization. For 
instance, nodes are required at locations of concentrated loads or discontinuity in loads, as 
shown in Figure 7–6(a) and (b). Nodal lines are defined by abrupt changes of plate thickness, 
as in Figure 7–6(c), and by abrupt changes of material properties, as in Figure 7–6(d) and (e). 
*Again, reflective symmetry means correspondence in size, shape, and position of loads; material properties; and boundary 
conditions that are on opposite sides of a dividing line or plane.

Mesh Revision (Refinement) and Convergence  
and h, p, and r Methods of Refinement
In this section we describe three methods often used to revise a finite element mesh with the 
goal of increasing the accuracy of the results by using only as many degrees of freedom as 
necessary. One then starts with a basic mesh using the fewest, reasonable number of elements, 
often based on some default parameter setting(s) of a computer program, such as for mesh 
density or mesh size or both, and then analyzes the model to obtain a bench mark solution. 
The model is then revised in some manner, such as by increasing the mesh density, reanalyzed

and compared to the previous mesh results. This process is continued until the results converge 
satisfactorily, based on some user-defined criteria.
For structural problems, to obtain displacements, rotations, stresses, and strains, many 
computer programs include two basic methods of revising a mesh and some a third. (These 
same methods apply to nonstructural problems as well.) These are called the h method; the p 
method; and the r method. These methods are then used to revise or refine a finite element mesh 
to improve the results in the next revised analysis. The goal of the analyst is to revise the mesh 
to obtain the necessary accuracy by using only as many degrees of freedom as necessary. The 
final objective of this so called adaptive refinement is to obtain equal distribution of an error 
indicator over all elements.
The discretization depends on the geometry of the structure, the loading pattern, and the 
boundary conditions. For instance, regions of stress concentration or high stress gradient due 
to fillets, holes, or re-entrant corners require a finer mesh near those regions, as indicated in 
Figures 7–4, 7–5, and 7–6(f).
We will briefly describe the h, p, and r methods of refinement and provide references for 
those interested in more in-depth understanding of these methods.
h Method of Refinement
In the h method of refinement, we use the particular element based on the shape functions 
for that element (for example, linear functions for the bar, quadratic for the beam, bilinear 
for the CST). We then start with a baseline mesh to provide a baseline solution for error 
estimation and to provide guidance for mesh revision. We then add elements of the same 
kind to refine or make smaller elements in the model. Sometimes a uniform refinement 
is done where the original element size [Figure 7–7(a)] is perhaps divided in two in both 
directions as shown in ­Figure 7–7(b). More often, the refinement is a nonuniform h refine-
ment as shown in ­Figure 7–7(c) (perhaps even a local refinement used to capture some 
physical phenomenon, such as a shock wave or a thin boundary layer in fluids) [19]. The 
mesh refinement is continued until the results from one mesh compare closely to those of 
the previously refined mesh. It is also possible that part of the mesh can be enlarged instead 
of refined. For instance, in regions where the stresses do not change or change slowly, larger 
elements may be quite acceptable. The h-type mesh refinement strategy had its beginnings 
in [20, 21, 22, 23]. Many commercial computer codes, such as [12], are based on the h 
refinement.
p Method of Refinement
In the p method of refinement [24, 25, 26, 27, 28], the polynomial p is increased from perhaps 
quadratic to a higher-order polynomial based on the degree of accuracy specified by the user. 
In the p method of refinement, the p method adjusts the order of the polynomial or the p level 
in the element field quantity, such as displacement, to better fit the conditions of the problem, 
such as the boundary conditions, the loading, and the geometry changes. A problem is solved 
at a given p level, and then the order of the polynomial is normally increased while the element 
geometry remains the same and the problem is solved again. The results of the iterations are 
compared to some set of convergence criteria specified by the user. Higher-order polynomials 
normally yield better solutions. This iteration process is done automatically within the com-
puter program. Therefore, the user does not need to manually change the size of elements by

creating a finer mesh, as must be done in the h method. (The h refinement can be automated 
using a remeshing algorithm within the finite element software.) Depending on the problem, 
a coarse mesh will often yield acceptable results. An extensive discussion of error indicators 
and estimates is given in the literature [19].
The p refinement may consist of adding degrees of freedom to existing nodes, adding 
nodes on existing boundaries between elements, and/or adding internal degrees of freedom. A 
uniform p refinement (same refinement performed on all elements) is shown in Figure 7–7(d). 
One of the more common commercial computer programs, Pro/MECHANICA [29], uses 
the p method exclusively. A typical discretized finite element model of a pulley using Pro/
MECHANICA is shown in Figure 7–7f.
r Method of Refinement
In the r method of refinement, the nodes are rearranged or relocated without changing the 
number of elements or the polynomial degree of their field quantities, i.e., displacements. 
­Figure  7–7(e) illustrates a possible r refinement of the original coarse mesh shown in 
­Figure 7–7(a). Notice in this r refinement that we have refined the mesh closer to the loads 
with resulting coarseness in the mesh away from the end loads.

Transition Triangles
Figure 7–4 illustrates the use of triangular elements for transitions from smaller quadrilaterals 
to larger quadrilaterals. This transition is necessary because for simple CST elements, inter-
mediate nodes along element edges are inconsistent with the energy formulation of the CST 
equations. If intermediate nodes were used, no assurance of compatibility would be possible, 
and resulting holes could occur in the deformed model. Using higher-order elements, such 
as the linear-strain triangle described in Chapter 8, allows us to use intermediate nodes along 
element edges and maintain compatibility.
Concentrated or Point Loads and Infinite Stress
Concentrated or point loads can be applied to nodes of an element provided the element sup-
ports the degree of freedom associated with the load. For instance, truss elements and two- 
and three-dimensional elements support only translational degrees of freedom, and therefore 
concentrated nodal moments cannot be applied to these elements; only concentrated forces 
can be applied. However, we should realize that physically concentrated forces are usually an 
idealization and mathematical convenience that represent a distributed load of high intensity 
acting over a small area.
According to classical linear theories of elasticity for beams, plates, and solid bodies 
[2, 16, 17], at a point loaded by a concentrated normal force there is finite displacement and 
stress in a beam, finite displacement but infinite stress in a plate, and infinite stress in a two- or 
three-dimensional solid body. These results are the consequences of the differing assumptions 
about the stress fields in standard linear theories of beams, plates, and solid elastic bodies. A 
truly concentrated force would cause material under the load to yield, and linear elastic theories 
do not predict yielding.
In a finite element analysis, when a concentrated force is applied to a node of a finite 
­element model, infinite displacement and stress are never computed. A concentrated force on 
a plane stress or strain model has a number of equivalent distributed loadings, which would 
not be expected to produce infinite stresses. Infinite stresses can be approached only as the 
mesh around the load is highly refined. The best we can hope for is that we can highly refine 
the mesh in the vicinity of the concentrated load as shown in Figure 7–6(a), with the under-
standing that the deformations and stresses will be approximate around the load, or that these 
stresses near the concentrated force are not the object of study, while stresses near another 
point away from the force, such as B in Figure 7–6(f), are of concern. The preceding remarks 
about concentrated forces apply to concentrated reactions as well.
Finally, another way to model with a concentrated force is to use additional elements and 
a single concentrated load as shown in Figure 7–6(h). The shape of the distribution used to 
simulate a distributed load can be controlled by the relative stiffness of the elements above the 
loading plane to the actual structure by changing the modulus of elasticity of these elements. 
This method spreads the concentrated load over a number of elements of the actual structure.
Infinite stress based on elasticity solutions may also exist for special geometries and load-
ings, such as the re-entrant corner shown in Figure 7–6(f). The stress is predicted to be infinite 
at the re-entrant corner. Hence, the finite element method based on linear elastic material mod-
els will never yield convergence (no matter how many times you refine the mesh) to a correct 
stress level at the re-entrant corner [18]. We must either change the sharp re-entrant corner to 
one with a radius or use a theory that accounts for plastic or yielding behavior in the material.

7.1  Finite Element Modeling
403
Infinite Medium
Figure 7–3 shows a typical symmetric model used to represent an infinite medium (a soil mass 
subjected to a foundation load). The guideline for the finite element model is that enough 
material must be included such that the displacements at nodes and stresses within the ele-
ments become negligibly small at locations far from the foundation load. Just how much of 
the medium should be modeled can be determined by a trial-and-error procedure in which 
the horizontal and vertical distances from the load are varied and the resulting effects on the 
displacements and stresses are observed. Alternatively, the experiences of other investigators 
working on similar problems may prove helpful. For a homogeneous soil mass, experience 
has shown that the influence of the footing becomes insignificant if the horizontal distance of 
the model is taken as approximately four to six times the width of the footing and the vertical 
distance is taken as approximately four to ten times the width of the footing [4, 5, 6]. Also, the 
use of infinite elements is described in Reference [13].
After choosing the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the model, we must idealize the 
boundary conditions. Usually, the horizontal displacement becomes negligible far from the load, 
and we restrain the horizontal movement of all the nodal points on that boundary (the right-side 
boundary in Figure 7–3). Hence, rollers are used to restrain the horizontal motion along the right 
side. The bottom boundary can be completely fixed, as is modeled in Figure 7–3 by using pin 
supports at each nodal point along the bottom edge. Alternatively, the bottom can be constrained 
only against vertical movement. The choice depends on the soil conditions at the bottom of the 
model. Usually, complete fixity is assumed if the lower boundary is taken as bedrock.
In Figure 7–3, the left-side vertical boundary is taken to be directly under the center 
of the load because symmetry has been assumed. As we said before when discussing sym-
metry, all nodal points along the vertical line of symmetry are restrained against horizontal 
displacement.
Finally, Reference [11] is recommended for additional discussion regarding guidelines in 
modeling with different element types, such as beams, plane stress/plane strain, and three-di-
mensional solids.
Connecting (Mixing) Different Kinds of Elements
Sometimes it becomes necessary in a model to combine different kinds of elements, such 
as beams and plane elements, such as CSTs. The problem with combining these elements is 
that they have different degrees of freedom at each node. The beam allows for transverse dis-
placement and rotation at each node, while the plane element only has in-plane displacements 
at each node. The beam can resist a concentrated moment at a node, whereas a plane element 
(CST) cannot. Therefore, if a beam element is connected to a plane element at a single node 
as shown in Figure 7–8(a), the result will be a hinge connection at A. This means only a force 
can be transmitted through the node between the two kinds of elements. This also creates a 
mechanism, as shown by the stiffness matrix being singular. This problem can be corrected 
by extending the beam into the plane element by adding one or more beam elements, shown 
as AB, for one beam element in Figure 7–8(b). Moment can now be transferred through the 
beam to the plane element. This extension assures that translational degrees of freedom of 
beam and plane element are connected at nodes A and B. Nodal rotations are associated with 
only the beam element, AB. The calculated stresses in the plane element will not normally be 
accurate near node A.

For more examples of connecting different kinds of elements see Figures 1–6, 1–11, 
12–11 and 16–33. These figures show examples of beam and plate elements connected together 
(Figures 1–6, 12–11, and 16–33) and solid (brick) elements connected to plates (Figure 1–11).
Checking the Model for Errors
The discretized finite element model should be checked carefully before results are computed. 
Ideally, a model should be checked by an analyst not involved in the preparation of the model, 
who is then more likely to be objective.
Preprocessors with their detailed graphical display capabilities now make it compar-
atively easy to find errors, particularly the more obvious ones involved with a misplaced 
node or missing element or a misplaced load or boundary support. Preprocessors include 
such niceties as color, shrink plots (showing elements separated from each other as in 
­Figure 7–9), rotated views, sectioning, exploded views, and removal of hidden lines to aid 
in error detection.
Most commercial codes also include warnings regarding overly distorted element 
shapes and checking for sufficient supports. However, the user must still select the proper 
element types, define sufficient support, and place supports and forces in proper locations 
with proper directions and magnitudes, use consistent units, etc., to obtain a successful 
analysis.
Checking the Results and Typical Postprocessor Results
The results should be checked for consistency by making sure that intended support nodes 
have zero displacement, as required. Also, mesh convergence studies should be done as 
previously described to observe convergence of results, such as displacements and stresses. 
If reflective symmetry exists, then stresses and displacements should exhibit this symme-
try. That is, we should understand that for symmetry with respect to one plane, analysis 
of either half of the structure yields a complete solution, because symmetric loading in 
a symmetric structure produces symmetric results. Computed results from the finite ele-
ment program should be compared with results from other available techniques, even if 
these techniques may be cruder than the finite element results. For instance, approximate 
mechanics of material formulas, experimental data, and numerical analysis of simpler 
but similar problems may be used for comparison, particularly if you have no real idea of 
the magnitude of the answers. Remember to use all results with some degree of caution,

as errors can crop up in such sources as textbook or handbook comparison solutions and 
experimental results.
In the end, the analyst should probably spend as much time processing, checking, and 
analyzing results as is spent in data preparation.
Finally, we present an additional typical postprocessor result for the plane stress problem of 
Figure 7–9 (Figure 7–10, on page 406). Other examples with results are shown in Section 7.6.
	 7.2 	 Equilibrium and Compatibility  
of Finite Element Results
An approximate solution for a stress analysis problem using the finite element method based 
on assumed displacement fields does not generally satisfy all the requirements for equilibrium 
and compatibility that an exact theory-of-elasticity solution satisfies. However, remember that 
relatively few exact solutions exist. Hence, the finite element method is a very practical one 
for obtaining reasonable, but approximate, numerical solutions. Recall the advantages of the 
finite element method as described in Chapter 1 and as illustrated numerous times throughout 
this text.
We now describe some of the approximations generally inherent in finite element solutions.

Equilibrium of nodal forces and moments is satisfied. This is true because the global equa-

and hence in the nodal equilibrium equations. Numerous example problems, particularly 
involving truss and frame analysis in Chapter 3 and 5, respectively, have illustrated the 
equilibrium of nodes and of total structures.
2.	
Equilibrium within an element is not always satisfied. However, for the constant-strain bar 
of Chapter 3 and the constant-strain triangle of Chapter 6, element equilibrium is satisfied. 
Also the cubic displacement function is shown to satisfy the basic beam equilibrium differ-
ential equation in Chapter 4 and hence to satisfy element force and moment equilibrium. 
However, elements such as the linear-strain triangle of Chapter 8, the axisymmetric ele-
ment of Chapter 9, and the rectangular element of Chapter 10 usually only approximately 
satisfy the element equilibrium equations.
3.	
Equilibrium is not usually satisfied across interelement boundaries. A differential element 
including parts of two adjacent finite elements is usually not in equilibrium (Figure 7–11). 
For line elements, such as used for truss and frame analysis, interelement equilibrium is 
satisfied, as shown in example problems in Chapters 3 through 5. However, for two- and 
three-dimensional elements, interelement equilibrium is not usually satisfied. For instance, 
the results of Example 6.2 indicate that the normal stress along the diagonal edge between 
the two elements is different in the two elements. Also, the coarseness of the mesh causes

this lack of interelement equilibrium to be even more pronounced. The normal and shear 
stresses at a free edge usually are not zero even though theory predicts them to be. Again, 
Example 6.2 illustrates this, with free-edge stresses 
y
s  and xy
s
 not equal to zero. However, 
as more elements are used (refined mesh) the 
y
s  and xy
s
 stresses on the stress-free edges 
will approach zero.
4.	
Continuity is satisfied within an element as long as the element displacement field is 
continuous. Hence, individual elements do not tear apart.
5.	
In the formulation of the element equations, continuity is invoked at the nodes. Hence, 
elements remain connected at their common nodes. Similarly, the structure remains con-
nected to its support nodes because boundary conditions are invoked at these nodes.
6.	
Continuity may or may not be satisfied along interelement boundaries. For line ­elements 
such as bars and beams, interelement boundaries are merely nodes. Therefore, the 
­preceding statement 5 applies for these line elements. The constant-strain triangle and 
the rectangular element of Chapter 6 remain straight-sided when deformed. Therefore, 
interelement continuity exists for these elements; that is, these plane elements deform

along common lines without openings, overlaps, or discontinuities. Incompatible ele-
ments, those that allow gaps or overlaps between elements, can be acceptable and even 
desirable. Incompatible element formulations, in some cases, have been shown to converge 
more rapidly to the exact solution [1]. (For more on this special topic, consult References 
[7] and [8].)
	 7.3 	 Convergence of Solution and Mesh Refinement
In Section 3.2, we presented guidelines for the selection of so-called compatible and complete 
displacement functions as they related to the bar element. Those four guidelines are generally 
applicable, and satisfaction of them has been shown to ensure monotonic convergence of the 
solution of a particular problem [9]. Furthermore, it has been shown [10] that these compatible 
and complete displacement functions used in the displacement formulation of the finite ele-
ment method yield an upper bound on the true stiffness (yielding models that are stiffer than 
the actual physical devise), and hence a lower bound on the displacement of the problem, as 
shown in Figure 7–12.
Hence, as the mesh size is reduced—that is, as the number of elements is increased—we 
are ensured of monotonic convergence of the solution when compatible and complete displace-
ment functions are used. Examples of this convergence are given in References [1] and [11], 
and in Table 7–2 for the beam with loading shown in Figure 7–1(a). All elements in the table 
are rectangular. The results in Table 7–2 indicate the influence of the number of elements (or 
the number of degrees of freedom as measured by the number of nodes) on the convergence 
toward a common solution, in this case the exact one. We again observe the influence of the 
aspect ratio. The higher the aspect ratio, even with a larger number of degrees of freedom, the 
worse the answer, as indicated by comparing cases 2 and 3.
Patch Test
To test the convergence of a solution of an element being used in your model, a test called 
the patch test was originally developed by Irons [30, 31] to examine the soundness of a 
nonconforming plate element and is further discussed by Taylor, et al. [32], MacNeal and 
Harder [33], Bathe [34], Belytschko, et al. [35], and Cook, et al. [7] (among others). The 
patch test is based in part on the same requirements described in Section 3.2: that the ele-
ment must be able to accommodate both rigid-body motion and constant state of strain, as

both are possible within a structure. The patch test then can be used to determined if the 
element satisfies convergence requirements, although, in general, the patch test is “neither 
sufficient nor necessary for convergence” [34]. The test also can be applied to determine if 
sufficient Gauss points have been used in the numerical integration process to evaluate the 
stiffness matrix when the concept of isoparametric formulation of stiffness matrices is used 
as described in Chapter 10.
Patch Test Example
In the example to follow, we show that when properly formulated displacement-based elements 
(as for instance given by Eqs. (6.2.2) for the plane stress/strain element) are used in compatible 
meshes (those meshes that satisfy both continuity between adjacent elements and continuity 
within an element), the patch test is automatically satisfied.
The patch test is performed by considering a simple finite element model composed of 
four irregular shaped elements of the same material with at least one node inside of the patch 
(called the patch node), as shown in Figure 7–13. The elements should be irregular, as some 
regular elements (such as rectangular) may pass the test whereas irregular ones will not. The 
elements may be all triangles or quadrilaterals or a mix of both. The boundary can be a rect-
angle though.

The “displacement” patch test can be used to check if the elements can represent ­ 
rigid-body motion and a constant state of strain. To verify if the elements can represent 
­rigid-body motion, we do the following:
Step 1  Set the x-displacements of all nodes on the boundary to a value (say 1). That is, 
let

 (x-translational rigid-body motion 
check). Set the y-displacement of these nodes to zero.
Step 2  Set the applied forces to zero at all nodes, including the interior node 5.
Step 3  Using the displacement values of 1 from step 1, set up the finite element equations 
using the stiffness method.
Step 4  Solve for the unknown displacements at node 5.
Step 5  To pass the rigid-body motion test, the computed x- and y-displacements at node 5 
should be equal to u 5 1
5
 and v 5 0
5
:
Step 6  Repeat the steps by now setting all vi’s to 1 except at node 5 (y-translational 
­rigid-body motion check). The displacement at node 5 should now become u 5 0
5
 
and v 5 1
5
.
Step 7  Repeat the steps with all ui
5
’s
1 and all vi 5
’s
1 except at node 5 (x – y diago-
nal ­rigid-body motion check). The displacements at node 5 should be u 5 1
5
 and 
v 5 1
5
.
Step 8  The strains should be calculated within each element and should be zero.
To verify that the elements can represent a state of constant strain, the following steps 
are taken:
Step 1  As strains are derivatives of displacements, constant strain conditions can be obtained 
by assuming linear displacement functions. So set u x y

 and v x y 5

0.

5 0. The displacement at each node must then be equal to its 
x-coordinate. In order to pass the patch test, the calculated x-displacement at node 5 
must equal its x-coordinate; that is, u 5 0.3
5
 and v 5 0.0
5
.
Step 2  Repeat step 1 with u x y 5

. This yields,

order to pass the patch test, the calculated y-displacement at node 5 must equal its 
y-coordinate; that is, u 5 0.0
5
 and v 5 0.4
5
.
Step 3  Repeat the steps again with the shear strain becoming xy
g
5 1 and the normal strains 
equal to zero.
The “force” patch test validates that errors associated with the applied loads do not occur. 
The steps are as follows:
Step 1  Assume a uniform traction of 
x
s
5 1 or some convenient constant value is applied 
along the right side of the patch. Replace this traction with its work-equivalent 
nodal load.
Step 2  Internal node 5 is not loaded.
Step 3  The patch has just enough supports to prevent rigid-body motion. In Figure 7–14, 
the left edge has one pin support and two rollers. (One roller would be sufficient to 
prevent rigid-body motion.) The roller supports allow for strain y
«  due to the Poisson 
effect. This strain will occur for Poisson’s ratio not equal to zero and therefore should 
be accounted for.

7.4  Interpretation of Stresses
411
Step 4  The finite element direct stiffness method is again used to obtain the displacements 
and element stresses. The uniform traction 
x
s
5 1 should be obtained within each 
element. The other in-plane stresses, 
y
s  and xy
s
, should be zero.
Step 5  Repeat the steps assuming first that 
y
s
5 1 along the top edge and the other stresses 
are zero. Then assume that 
5 1
xy
s
 and the two normal stresses equal zero.
The patch test also can be applied to other element types. For instance, a patch of solid ele-
ments described for a three-dimensional stress state in Chapter 11 should be able to properly yield 
all six constant states of stress. The patch test for the plate bending analysis described in ­Chapter 12 
should yield constant bending moments Mx and My and constant twisting moment Mxy.
An element that passes the patch test is capable of meeting the following requirements:
	(a)	 Predicting rigid-body motion without strain when this state exists.
	(b)	 Predicting states of constant strain if they occur.
	(c)	 Compatibility with adjacent elements when a state of constant strain exists in adjacent 
elements.
When these requirements are met, it is sufficient to guarantee that a mesh of these elements 
will yield convergence to the solution as the mesh is continually refined.
The patch test is then a standard test for developers of new elements to test whether the 
element has the necessary convergence properties. But the test does not indicate how well an 
element works in other applications. An element passing the patch test may still yield poor 
accuracy in a coarse mesh or show slow convergence as the mesh is refined.
	 7.4 	 Interpretation of Stresses
In the stiffness or displacement formulation of the finite element method used throughout 
this text, the primary quantities determined are the interelement nodal displacements of the 
assemblage. The secondary quantities, such as strain and stress in an element, are then obtained 
through use of 
B d
« 5
{ }
[ ]{ } and 
D B d
s 5
{ }
[ ][ ]{ }. For elements using linear-displacement 
models, such as the bar and the constant-strain triangle, [B] is constant, and since we assume 
[D] to be constant, the stresses are constant over the element. In this case, it is common practice 
to assign the stress to the centroid of the element with acceptable results.
However, as illustrated in Section 3.11 for the axial member, stresses are not predicted 
as accurately as the displacements (see Figures 3–31 and 3–32). For example, remember the

constant-strain or constant-stress element has been used in modeling the beam in Figure 7–1. 
Therefore, the stress in each element is assumed constant. Figure 7–15 compares the exact 
beam theory solution for bending stress through the beam depth at the centroidal location of 
the elements next to the wall with the finite element solution of case 4 in Table 7–2. This finite 
element model consists of four elements through the beam depth. Therefore, only four stress 
values are obtained through the depth. Again, the best approximation of the stress appears to 
occur at the midpoint of each element, since the derivative of displacement is better predicted 
between the nodes than at the nodes.
For higher-order elements, such as the linear-strain triangle of Chapter 8, [B], and hence 
the stresses, are functions of the coordinates. The common practice is then to directly evaluate 
the stresses at the centroid of the element.
An alternative procedure sometimes is to use an average (possibly weighted) value of 
the stresses evaluated at each node of the element. This averaging method is often based on 
evaluating the stresses at the Gauss points located within the element (described in Chapter 10) 
and then interpolating to the element nodes using the shape functions of the specific element. 
Then these stresses in all elements at a common node are averaged to represent the stress at the 
node. This averaging process is called smoothing. Figure 7–9 shows a von Mises stress “fringe 
carpet” (dithered) contour plot obtained by smoothing.
Smoothing results in a pleasing, continuous plot which may not indicate some serious 
problems with the model and the results. You should always view the unsmoothed contour 
plots as well. Highly discontinuous contours between elements in a region of an unsmoothed 
plot indicate modeling problems and typically require additional refinement of the element 
mesh in the suspect region.
If the discontinuities in an unsmoothed contour plot are small or are in regions of little con-
sequence, a smoothed contour plot can normally be used with a high degree of confidence in the 
results. There are, however, exceptions when smoothing leads to erroneous results. For instance, 
if the thickness changes significantly between adjacent elements [See Figure 7–6(c)], the stresses 
will normally be different from one element to the next across the change in thickness. Smoothing 
will likely hide the actual stress results. If there is a change in material stiffness due to ­different E’s, 
this change will cause an abrupt change in strain across the different materials [See ­Figure 7–6(d)].

Again, smoothing will likely hide this abrupt change in strain. Also, for shrink-fit problems 
­involving one cylinder being expanded enough by heating to slip over the smaller one, the cir-
cumferential stress between the mating cylinders is normally quite different [16].
The computer program examples in Section 7.6 show additional results, such as displaced 
models, along with smoothed stress plots. The stresses to be plotted can be von Mises (used in 
the maximum distortion energy theory to predict failure of ductile materials subjected to static 
loading as described in Section 6.5); Tresca (used in the Tresca or maximum shear stress theory 
also to predict failure of ductile materials subjected to static loading) [14, 16], and maximum 
and minimum principal stresses.

	 7.6 	 Computer Program–Assisted Step-by-Step  
Solution, Other Models, and Results  
for Plane Stress/Strain Problems
In this section, we present a computer-assisted step-by-step solution of a plane stress problem, 
along with results of some plane stress/strain problems solved using a computer program [12].  
These results illustrate the various kinds of difficult problems that can be solved using a gen-
eral-purpose computer program.
The computer-assisted step-by-step problem is the bicycle wrench shown in Figure 7–17(a) 
on page 415. The following steps have been used to solve for the stresses in the wrench. (Some 
of these steps may be interchanged.)
Step 1   The first step is to draw the outline of the wrench using a standard drawing program 
as shown in Figure 7–17(a). The exact dimensions of the wrench are obtained from 
Figure P7–38, where the overall depth of the wrench is 20 mm, the length is 140 mm, 
and the sides of the hexagons are 9 mm long for the middle one and 7 mm long for 
the side ones. The radius of the enclosed ends is 15 mm.
Step 2   The second step is to use a two-dimensional mesh generator to create the model mesh 
as shown in Figure 7–17(b)–(d).
Step 3   The third step is to apply the boundary conditions to the proper nodes using the proper 
boundary condition command. This is shown in Figure 7–17(c) as indicated by the 
small D signs at the nodes on the inside of the left hexagonal shaped hole. The D sign 
indicates complete fixity for a node. This means these nodes are constrained from 
translating in the y and z directions in the plane of the wrench.
Step 4   The fourth step requires us to select the surface where the distributed loading is to 
be applied and then the magnitude of the surface traction. This is the upper surface 
between the middle and right hexagonal holes where the surface traction of 4.41 MPa 
is applied as also shown in Figure 7–17(c). In the computer program this surface 
changes to the color red as selected by the user.
Step 5   In step 5 we choose the material properties. Here ASTM A-514 steel has been 
selected, as this is quenched and tempered steel with high yield strength and will 
allow for the thickness to be minimized.
Step 6   In step six we select the element type for the kind of analysis to be performed. Here 
we select the plane stress element, as this is a good approximation to the kind of 
behavior that is produced in a plane stress analysis. For the plane stress element a 
thickness is required. An initial guess of 10 mm is made. This thickness appears to 
be compatible with the other dimensions of the wrench.
Step 7   The seventh step is an optional check of the model. If you choose to perform this 
step you will see the boundary conditions now appear as triangles at the left nodes 
corresponding to full fixity and the surface traction arrows, indicating the location 
and direction of the surface traction shown also in Figure 7–17(c).
Step 8   In step 8 we perform the stress analysis of the model.
Step 9   In step 9 we select the results, such as the displacement plot, the principal stress plot, 
and the von Mises stress plot. The von Mises stress plot is used to determine the

failure of the wrench based on the maximum distortion energy theory as described 
in Section 6.5. The von Mises stress plot is shown in Figure 7–17(d). The maximum 
von Mises stress indicated in Figure 7–17(d) is 290 MPa, and the yield strength of 
the ASTM A-514 steel is 690 MPa. Therefore, the wrench is safe from yielding. 
Additional trials can be made if the factor of safety is satisfied and if the maximum 
deflection appears to be satisfactory.

left edge and loaded around the right inner edge of the hole with a total force of 13.35 kN. For 
more details, including the geometry of this rod, see Figure P7–15 at the end of this chapter. 
Figure 7–18(b) shows the resulting maximum principal stress. The largest principal stress of 
79,750 kPa occurs at the top and bottom inside edges of the hole.

device was modeled. Node S at the shear pin location was constrained from vertical motion, 
five nodes along the left side of pin hole B were constrained in both the horizontal and vertical 
directions, and all nodes at the pin hole at A were constrained in the vertical direction. A load 
of 700 N was spread over the three lowest nodes at the inner side of the right section hanging 
down near point E to simulate the load to fail the pin at S in shear at a stress of 40 MPa. The 
largest von Mises stress of 201 MPa occurs at the inner edge of the cutout section for a device 
with thickness of 12 mm.
Figure 7–20 shows the plot of the von Mises stress of a  tapered plate with a hole in it, 
subjected to tensile loading of 5 kN acting along the right edge. The left edge is fixed. For more 
details of this problem, see Problem 7.26. The largest von Mises stress of 6.17 MPa occurs at 
the top edge of the hole, whereas the second largest von Mises stress of 5.78 MPa occurs at 
the elbow between the smallest cross section and where the taper begins.
Figure 7–21 shows the plot of the von Mises stresses in an adjustable wrench subjected to 
700 N of force applied over the top 50 mm of the wrench as shown. The largest von Mises stress 
of 29.72 MPa occurs at the outer edge of the right side at the lowest location of the narrow part 
of the handle. The lower inside surface of the wrench is fixed to simulate the wrench engaged 
with a bolt. For more details of this problem, see Problem 7.28.
Finally, Figure 7–22(a) shows a finite element model and the von Mises stress plot for a 
beam welded to a column by top and bottom fillet welds. A surface contact between the beam 
and column was used that allowed the beam and column to separate wherever tension existed 
along the surfaces in contact. The beam is 70 mm thick by 120 mm deep by 200 mm long with 
a load of 10 kN applied vertically 160 mm from the left end of the beam and at 60 mm down 
from the top edge of the beam. The material is steel with E 5 205 GPa and ν 5 0.25 for all 
material. The weld leg size is 6 mm.

After mesh refinement around the top weld to double the number of elements in the weld, 
the maximum von Mises stress was determined to be 87.3 MPa at the toe of the top weld as 
seen best in the zoomed-in Figure 7–22(b). This value compares reasonably well with that 
obtained by the classical method shown on pages 458–460 of Reference [36] where a value

	 A plate with an off-center hole is shown in Figure P7–36. Determine how close to the top 
edge the hole can be placed before yielding of the A36 steel occurs (based on the maximum 
distortion energy theory). The applied tensile stress is 70,000 kPa, and the plate thick-
ness is 6 mm. Now if the plate is made of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy with a yield strength 
of 255 MPa, does this change your answer? If the plate thickness is changed to 12 mm,  
how does this change the results? Use same total load as when the plate is 6 mm thick.

Development of the Linear-
Strain Triangle Equations
Chapter Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Develop the linear-strain triangular (LST) element stiffness matrix.
■ Describe how the LST stiffness matrix can be determined.
■ Compare the difference in results using the CST and LST elements.
Introduction
In this chapter, we consider the development of the stiffness matrix and equations for a high-
er-order triangular element, called the linear-strain triangle (LST). This element is available 
in many commercial computer programs and has some advantages over the constant-strain 
triangle described in Chapter 6.
The LST element has six nodes and twelve unknown displacement degrees of freedom. 
The displacement functions for the element are quadratic instead of linear (as in the CST).
The procedures for development of the equations for the LST element follow the same 
steps as those used in Chapter 6 for the CST element. However, the number of equations now 
becomes twelve instead of six, making a longhand solution extremely cumbersome. Hence, 
we will use a computer to perform many of the mathematical operations.
After deriving the element equations, we will compare results from problems solved using 
the LST element with those solved using the CST element. The introduction of the higher-­
order LST element will illustrate the possible advantages of higher order elements and should 
enhance your general understanding of the concepts involved with finite element procedures.
	 8.1 	 Derivation of the Linear-Strain Triangular Element 
Stiffness Matrix and Equations
We will now derive the LST stiffness matrix and element equations. The steps used here are 
identical to those used for the CST element, and much of the notation is the same.
Step 1 Select Element Type
Consider the triangular element shown in Figure 8–1 with the usual end nodes and three 
­additional nodes conveniently located at the midpoints of the sides. Thus, a computer program

(8.1.2)
Again, the number of coefficients ai (12) equals the total number of degrees of freedom for the 
element. The displacement compatibility among adjoining elements is satisfied because three 
nodes are located along each side and a parabola is defined by three points on its path. Since 
adjacent elements are connected at common nodes, their displacement compatibility across 
the boundaries will be maintained.
In general, when considering triangular elements, we can use a complete polynomial in 
Cartesian coordinates to describe the displacement field within an element. Using internal 
nodes as necessary for the higher-order cubic and quartic elements, we use all terms of a trun-
cated Pascal triangle in the displacement field or, equivalently, the shape functions, as shown

previously in Chapter 6. The complete quadratic function is used for the LST of this chapter. 
The complete cubic function is used for the quadratic-strain triangle (QST), with an internal 
node necessary as the tenth node.

where [D] is given by Eq. (6.1.8) for plane stress or by Eq. (6.1.10) for plane strain. These

(8.1.17)
where the b’s and g’s are now functions of x and y as well as of the nodal coordinates, as is 
illustrated for a specific linear-strain triangle in Section 8.2 by Eq. (8.2.8). The stiffness matrix 
is then seen to be a 12

 matrix on multiplying the matrices in Eq. (8.1.16). The stiffness 
matrix, Eq. (8.1.16), is very cumbersome to obtain in explicit form, so it will not be given here. 
However, if the origin of the coordinates is considered to be at the centroid of the element, 
the integrations become amenable [9]. Alternatively, area coordinates [3, 8, 9] can be used 
to obtain an explicit form of the stiffness matrix. However, even the use of area coordinates 
usually involves tedious calculations. Therefore, the integration is best carried out numerically. 
(Numerical integration is described in Section 10.3.)
The element body forces and surface forces should not be automatically lumped at the 
nodes, but for a consistent formulation (one that is formulated from the same shape functions 
used to formulate the stiffness matrix), Eqs. (6.3.1) and (6.3.7), respectively, should be used.

(Problems 8.3 and 8.4 illustrate this concept.) These forces can be added to any concentrated

those in Section 6.2 for the CST. However, instead of constant stresses in each element, we 
now have a linear variation of the stresses in each element. Common practice was to use the 
centroidal element stresses. Current practice is to use the average of the nodal element stresses.
	 8.2 	 Example LST Stiffness Determination
To illustrate some of the procedures outlined in Section 8.1 for deriving an LST stiffness 
matrix, consider the following example. Figure 8–3 shows a specific LST and its coordinates. 
The triangle is of base dimension b and height h, with midside nodes.
Using the first six equations of Eq. (8.1.5), we calculate the coefficients 1a  through 6
a  by 
evaluating the displacement u at each of the six known coordinates of each node as follows:

(8.2.9)
The stiffness matrix for a constant-thickness element can now be obtained on substituting 
Eqs. (8.2.8) into Eq. (8.1.17) to obtain [B], then substituting [B] into Eq. (8.1.16) and using 
calculus to set up the appropriate integration. The explicit expression for the 12
12
3
 stiffness 
matrix, being extremely cumbersome to obtain, is not given here. Stiffness matrix expressions 
for higher-order elements are found in References [1] and [2].
	 8.3 	 Comparison of Elements
For a given number of nodes, a better representation of true stress and displacement is generally 
obtained using the LST element than is obtained with the same number of nodes using a much 
finer subdivision into simple CST elements. For example, using one LST yields better results 
than using four CST elements with the same number of nodes (Figure 8–4) and hence the same 
number of degrees of freedom (except for the case when constant stress exists).
We now present results to compare the CST of Chapter 6 with the LST of this chapter. 
Consider the cantilever beam subjected to a concentrated load acting as shown in Figure 8–5. 
Let 
5 210 GPa
E
, ν 5 0.25, 
5 180 kN
P
 and 5 25.4 mm
t
.
Table 8–1 lists the series of tests run to compare results using the CST and LST elements. 
Table 8–2 shows comparisons of free-end (tip) deflection and stress 
x
s  for each element type 
used to model the cantilever beam. From Table 8–2, we can observe that the larger the number 
of degrees of freedom for a given type of triangular element, the closer the solution converges 
to the exact one (compare run A-1 to run A-2, and B-1 to B-2). For a given number of nodes, the

8.3  Comparison of Elements

LST analysis yields somewhat better results for displacement than the CST analysis ­(compare 
run A-1 to run B-1).
However, one of the reasons that the bending stress 
x
s  predicted by the LST model B-1 
compared to CST model A-1 is not as accurate is as follows. Recall that the stress is calculated 
at the centroid of the element. We observe from the table that the location of the bending stress 
is closer to the wall and closer to the top for the CST model A-1 compared to the LST model 
B-1. As the classical bending stress is a linear function with increasing positive linear stress 
from the neutral axis for the downward applied load in this example, we expect the largest 
stress to be at the very top of the beam. So the model A-1 with more and smaller elements 
(with eight elements through the beam depth) has its centroid closer to the top (at 18.75 mm 
from the top) than model B-1 with few elements (two elements through the beam depth) with 
centroidal stress located at 37.5 mm from the top. Similarly, comparing A-2 to B-2 we observe 
the same trend in the results—displacement at the top end being more accurately predicted by 
the LST model, but stresses being calculated at the centroid making the A-2 model appear more 
accurate than the LST model due to the location where the stress is reported.

Although the CST element is rather poor in modeling bending, we observe from 
Table 8–2 that the element can be used to model a beam in bending if a sufficient number 
of elements are used through the depth of the beam. In general, both LST and CST analy-
ses yield results good enough for most plane stress/strain problems, provided a sufficient 
number of elements are used. In fact, most commercial programs incorporate the use of 
CST and/or LST elements for plane stress/strain problems, although these elements are 
used primarily as transition elements (usually during mesh generation). The four-sided 
isoparametric plane stress/strain element is most frequently used in commercial programs 
and is described in Chapter 10.
Also, recall that finite element displacements will always be less than (or equal to) the 
exact ones, because finite element models are normally predicted to be stiffer than the actual 
structures when the displacement formulation of the finite element method is used. (The rea-
son for the stiffer model was discussed in Sections 3.10 and 7.3. Proof of this assertion can be 
found in References [4-7].
Finally, Figure 8–6 (from Reference [8]) illustrates a comparison of CST and LST models 
of a plate subjected to parabolically distributed edge loads. Figure 8–6 shows that the LST 
model converges to the exact solution for horizontal displacement at point A faster than does 
the CST model. However, the CST model is quite acceptable even for modest numbers of 
degrees of freedom. For example, a CST model with 100 nodes (200 degrees of freedom) often 
yields nearly as accurate a solution as does an LST model with the same number of degrees 
of freedom.
In conclusion, the results of Table 8–2 and Figure 8–6 indicate that the LST model might 
be preferred over the CST model for plane stress applications when relatively small numbers 
of nodes are used. However, the use of triangular elements of higher order, such as the LST, is 
not visibly advantageous when large numbers of nodes are used, particularly when the cost of 
formation of the element stiffnesses, equation bandwidth, and overall complexities involved 
in the computer modeling are considered.
The Q4 rectangle and CST were compared in Section 6.6 (See Table 6.1). The general 
quadrilateral elements Q4, Q6, Q8, Q9, and Q12 are described in Chapter 10, and a comparison 
of the Q4 and Q6 results for a beam bending problem is given in Table 10.3. There is also a 
comparison of CST, LST, Q4, Q6, Q8, and Q9 results for a differently meshed beam bending 
problem in Table 10.4.

Axisymmetric Elements
Chapter Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Review the basic concepts and theory of elasticity equations for axisymmetric 
behavior.
■ Derive the axisymmetric element stiffness matrix, body force, and surface ­traction 
equations.
■ Demonstrate the solution of an axisymmetric pressure vessel using the stiffness 
method.
■ Compare the finite element solution to an exact solution for a cylindrical pressure vessel.
■ Illustrate some practical applications of axisymmetric elements.
Introduction
In previous chapters, we have been concerned with line or one-dimensional elements (Chap-
ters 2 through 5) and two-dimensional elements (Chapters 6 through 8). In this chapter, we 
consider a special two-dimensional element called the axisymmetric element. This element is 
quite useful when symmetry with respect to geometry and loading exists about an axis of the 
body being analyzed. Problems that involve soil masses subjected to circular footing loads or 
thick-walled pressure vessels can often be analyzed using the element developed in this chapter.
We begin with the development of the stiffness matrix for the simplest axisymmetric ele-
ment, the triangular torus, whose vertical cross section is a plane triangle.
We then present the longhand solution of a thick-walled pressure vessel to illustrate the 
use of the axisymmetric element equations. This is followed by a description of some typical 
large-scale problems that have been modeled using the axisymmetric element.
	 9.1 	 Derivation of the Stiffness Matrix
In this section, we will derive the stiffness matrix and the body and surface force matrices for 
the axisymmetric element. However, before the development, we will first present some fun-
damental concepts prerequisite to the understanding of the derivation. Axisymmetric elements 
are triangular tori such that each element is symmetric with respect to geometry and loading

about an axis such as the z axis in Figure 9–1. Hence, the z axis is called the axis of symmetry 
or the axis of revolution. Each vertical cross section of the element is a plane triangle. The 
nodal points of an axisymmetric triangular element describe circumferential lines, as indicated 
in Figure 9–1.
In plane stress problems, stresses exist only in the x – y plane. In axisymmetric problems, 
the radial displacements develop circumferential strains that induce stresses 
r
s , su, 
z
s , and 
rz
τ , where r, u, and z indicate the radial, circumferential, and longitudinal directions, respec-
tively. Triangular torus elements are often used to idealize the axisymmetric system because 
they can be used to simulate complex surfaces and are simple to work with. For instance, the 
axisymmetric problem of a semi-infinite half-space loaded by a circular area (circular footing) 
shown in Figure 9–2(a), the domed pressure vessel shown in Figure 9–2(b), and the engine 
valve stem shown in Figure 9–2(c) can be solved using the axisymmetric element developed 
in this chapter.
Because of symmetry in geometry, material properties, boundary conditions, and loads 
about the z axis, the stresses are independent of the u coordinate. Therefore, all derivatives with 
respect to u vanish, and the displacement component v (tangent to the u direction), the shear 
strains r
g u and 
z
gu , and the shear stresses 
u
s r  and u
s z are all zero.
Figure 9–3 shows an axisymmetric ring element and its cross section to represent the 
general state of strain for an axisymmetric problem. It is most convenient to express the dis-
placements of an element ABCD in the plane of a cross section in cylindrical coordinates. We 
then let u and w denote the displacements in the radial and longitudinal directions, respectively. 
The side AB of the element is displaced an amount u, and side CD is then displaced an amount

 in the radial direction. The normal strain in the radial direction is then given by

(9.1.1a)
In general, the strain in the tangential direction depends on the tangential displacement v and 
on the radial displacement u. However, for axisymmetric deformation behavior, recall that the 
tangential displacement v is equal to zero. Hence, the tangential strain is due only to the radial 
displacement. Having only radial displacement u, the new length of the arc

Step 1  Select Element Type
An axisymmetric solid is shown discretized in Figure 9–5(a), along with a typical triangular 
element. The element has three nodes with two degrees of freedom per node (that is, ui, wi at 
node i). The stresses in the axisymmetric problem are shown in Figure 9–5(b).

so that we have the same linear displacement functions as used in the plane stress,

ment functions is the same as the total number of degrees of freedom for the element. The

We can evaluate Eq. (9.1.24) for [k] by one of three methods:

Numerical integration (Gaussian quadrature) as discussed in Chapter 10.

Explicit multiplication and term-by-term integration [1].

Steps 5 through 7
Steps 5 through 7, which involve assembling the total stiffness matrix, total force matrix, and 
total set of equations; solving for the nodal degrees of freedom; and calculating the element 
stresses, are analogous to those of Chapter 6 for the CST element, except the stresses are not 
constant in each element. They are usually determined by one of two methods that we use to 
determine the LST element stresses. Either we determine the centroidal element stresses, or 
we determine the nodal stresses for the element and then average them. The latter method has 
been shown to be more accurate in some cases [2].
Example 9.1
For the element of an axisymmetric body rotating with a constant angular velocity 
100 rev/min
v 5
 as shown in Figure 9–8, evaluate the approximate body force matrix. 
Include the weight of the material, where the weight density w
r  is 77000 N/m3. The coor-
dinates of the element (in cm) are shown in the figure.
We need to evaluate Eq. (9.1.31) to obtain the approximate body force matrix. There-
fore, the body forces per unit volume evaluated at the centroid of the element are

	 9.2 	 Solution of an Axisymmetric Pressure Vessel
To illustrate the use of the equations developed in Section 9.1, we will now solve an axisym-
metric stress problem.
Example 9.2
For the long, thick-walled cylinder under internal pressure p equal to 1 pa shown in 
­Figure 9–9, determine the displacements and stresses.
Discretization
To illustrate the finite element solution for the cylinder, we first discretize the cylinder 
into four triangular elements, as shown in Figure 9–10. A horizontal slice of the cylinder 
represents the total cylinder behavior. Because we are performing a longhand solution, a

Figure 9–13 shows the exact solution [10] along with the results determined here and 
the results from Reference [5]. Observe that agreement with the exact solution is quite 
good except for the limited results due to the very coarse mesh used in the longhand 
example, and in case 1 of Reference [5]. In Reference [5], stresses have been plotted at 
the center of the quadrilaterals and were obtained by averaging the stresses in the four 
connecting triangles.
	 9.3 	 Applications of Axisymmetric Elements
Numerous structural (and nonstructural) systems can be classified as axisymmetric. Some typ-
ical structural systems whose behavior is modeled accurately using the axisymmetric element 
developed in this chapter are represented in Figures 9–14, 9–15, and 9–17.
Figure 9–14 illustrates the finite element model of a steel-reinforced concrete pressure 
vessel. The vessel is a thick-walled cylinder with flat heads. An axis of symmetry (the z axis) 
exists such that only one-half of the r-z plane passing through the middle of the structure need 
be modeled. The concrete was modeled by using the axisymmetric triangular element devel-
oped in this chapter. The steel elements were laid out along the boundaries of the concrete 
elements so as to maintain continuity (or perfect bond assumption) between the concrete and

that the nodes along the axis of symmetry should be supported by rollers preventing motion 
perpendicular to the axis of symmetry.
Figure 9–15 shows a finite element model of a high-strength steel die used in a thin-­
plastic-film-making process [7]. The die is an irregularly shaped disk. An axis of symmetry 
with respect to geometry and loading exists as shown. The die was fixed along the top surface 
as it was mounted to a stiff platen. The die was modeled by using simple quadrilateral axisym-
metric elements. The locations of high stress were of primary concern. Figure 9–16 shows a

plot of the von Mises stress contours for the die of Figure 9–15. The von Mises (or equivalent, 
or effective) stress [8] is often used as a failure criterion in design. Notice the artificially high 
stresses at the location of load F as explained in Section 7.1.
(Recall that the failure criterion based on the maximum distortion energy theory for ductile 
materials subjected to static loading predicts that a material will fail if the von Mises stress 
reaches the yield strength of the material.) Also recall from Eqs. (6.5.37) and (6.5.38), the von 
Mises stress

s . These results were obtained from the 
commercial computer code ANSYS [12].
Other dies with modifications in geometry were also studied to evaluate the most suitable 
die before the construction of an expensive prototype. Confidence in the acceptability of the 
prototype was enhanced by doing these comparison studies. Finally, Figure 9–17 shows a 
stepped 4130 steel shaft with a fillet radius subjected to an axial pressure of 700 N/cm2 in 
tension. Fatigue analysis for reversed axial loading required an accurate stress concentration 
factor to be applied to the average axial stress of 700 N/cm2. The stress concentration factor 
for the geometry shown was to be determined. Therefore, locations of highest stress were 
necessary. Figure 9–18 shows the resulting maximum principal stress plot using a computer 
program [11]. The largest principal stress was 1507.4 N/cm2 at the fillet. Other examples of 
the use of the axisymmetric element can be found in References [2–6].
In this chapter, we have shown the finite element analysis of axisymmetric ­systems using 
a simple three-noded triangular element to be analogous to that of the two-­dimensional plane 
stress problem using three-noded triangular elements as developed in Chapter 6. Therefore, the 
two-dimensional element in commercial computer programs with the axisymmetric element 
selected will allow for the analysis of axisymmetric structures.

Summary Equations
Finally, note that other axisymmetric elements, such as a simple quadrilateral (one with 
four corner nodes and two degrees of freedom per node, as used in the steel die analysis of 
Figure 9–15) or higher-order triangular elements, such as in Reference [6], in which a cubic 
polynomial involving ten terms (ten a’s) for both u and w, could be used for axisymmetric 
analysis. The three-noded triangular element was described here because of its simplicity and 
ability to describe geometric boundaries rather easily.

	 A steel cylindrical pressure vessel with flat plate end caps is shown in Figure P9–20 
with vertical axis of symmetry. Addition of thickened sections helps to reduce stress 
concentrations in the corners. Analyze the design and identify the most critically 
stressed regions. Note that inside sharp re-entrant corners produce infinite stress 
concentration zones, so refining the mesh in these regions will not help you get 
a better answer unless you use an inelastic theory or place small fillet radii there.

Introduction
In this chapter, we introduce the isoparametric formulation of the element stiffness matrices. 
After considering the linear-strain triangular element in Chapter 8, we can see that the devel-
opment of element matrices and equations expressed in terms of a global coordinate system 
becomes an enormously difficult task (if even possible) except for the simplest of elements such 
as the constant-strain triangle of Chapter 6. Hence, the isoparametric formulation was devel-
oped [1]. The isoparametric method may appear somewhat tedious (and confusing initially), 
but it will lead to a simple computer program formulation, and it is generally applicable for

two- and three-dimensional stress analysis and for nonstructural problems. The isoparametric 
formulation allows elements to be created that are nonrectangular and have curved sides. Fur-
thermore, numerous commercial computer programs  (as described in Chapter 1) have adapted 
this formulation for their various libraries of elements.
We first illustrate the isoparametric formulation to develop the simple bar element stiff-
ness matrix. Use of the bar element makes it relatively easy to understand the method because 
simple expressions result.
We then consider the development of the isoparametric formulation of the simple quadri-
lateral element stiffness matrix.
Next, we will introduce numerical integration methods for evaluating the quadrilateral 
element stiffness matrix and illustrate the adaptability of the isoparametric formulation to 
common numerical integration methods.
Finally, we will consider some higher-order elements and their associated shape functions 
and compare their performance to the beam element.
	10.1 	 Isoparametric Formulation of the Bar Element 
Stiffness Matrix
The term isoparametric is derived from the use of the same shape functions (or interpolation 
functions) N
[
] to define the element’s geometric shape as are used to define the displacements 
within the element. Thus, when the shape function is u
a

 for the displacement, we 
use x

a s

 for the description of the nodal coordinate of a point on the bar element and, 
hence, the physical shape of the element.
Isoparametric element equations are formulated using a natural (or intrinsic) coordinate 
system s that is defined by element geometry and not by the element orientation in the glob-
al-coordinate system. In other words, axial coordinate s is attached to the bar and remains 
directed along the axial length of the bar, regardless of how the bar is oriented in space. There 
is a relationship (called a transformation mapping) between the natural coordinate system s 
and the global coordinate system x for each element of a specific structure, and this relation-
ship must be used in the element equation formulations.
We will now develop the isoparametric formulation of the stiffness matrix of a simple 
linear bar element [with two nodes as shown in Figure 10–1(a)].
Step 1 Select Element Type
First, the natural coordinate s is attached to the element, with the origin located at the center 
of the element, as shown in Figure 10–1(b). The s axis need not be parallel to the x axis—this 
is only for convenience.

We consider the bar element to have two degrees of freedom—axial displacements u1 and 
u2 at each node associated with the global x axis.

can be related by

The shape functions used to define a position within the bar are found in a manner similar

The linear shape functions in Eqs. (10.1.5) map the s coordinate of any point in the element

5 2  into 
Eq. (10.1.3), we obtain x
x1
5
. These shape functions are shown in Figure 10–2, where we can 
see that they have the same properties as defined for the interpolation functions of Section 3.1. 
Hence, N1 represents the physical shape of the coordinate x when plotted over the length of the 
element for x

of the element for x

These shape functions must also be continuous throughout the element domain and have

10.1  Isoparametric Formulation of the Bar Element Stiffness Matrix
489
When a particular coordinate s of the point of interest is substituted into N
[
], Eq. (10.1.6) 
yields the displacement of a point on the bar in terms of the nodal degrees of freedom u1 and 
u2 as shown in Figure 10–2(c). Since u and x are defined by the same shape functions at the 
same nodes, comparing Eqs. (10.1.4) and Eqs. (10.1.6), the element is called isoparametric.
Step 3 Define the Strain–Displacement and Stress/Strain Relationships
We now want to formulate element matrix B
[ ] to evaluate k
[ ] for the bar element. We use the 
isoparametric formulation to illustrate its manipulations. For a simple bar element, no real 
advantage may appear evident. However, for higher-order elements, the advantage will become 
clear because relatively simple computer program formulations will result.
To construct the element stiffness matrix, we must determine the strain, which is defined 
in terms of the derivative of the displacement with respect to x. The displacement u, however, 
is now a function of s as given by Eq. (10.1.6). Therefore, we must apply the chain rule of 
differentiation to the function u as follows:

which is the same as Eq. (3.1.14). For higher-order one-dimensional elements, the integration

angular element stiffness matrix is difficult to evaluate in closed form (Section 6.6). However, 
the use of numerical integration, as described in Section 10.3, illustrates the distinct advantage 
of the isoparametric formulation of the equations.

	10.2 	 Isoparametric Formulation of the Plane Quadrilateral 
(Q4) Element Stiffness Matrix

 for the description of a coordinate point in the plane element.
The natural-coordinate system s-t is defined by element geometry and not by the element 
orientation in the global-coordinate system x – y. Much as in the bar element example, there is 
a transformation mapping between the two coordinate systems for each element of a specific 
structure, and this relationship must be used in the element formulation.
We will now formulate the isoparametric formulation of the simple linear plane quadrilat-
eral element stiffness matrix (also recall it is called the Q4 element because it has four corner 
nodes only). This formulation is general enough to be applied to more complicated (higher-­
order) elements such as a quadratic plane element with three nodes along an edge, which can 
have straight or quadratic curved sides. Higher-order elements have additional nodes and use 
different shape functions as compared to the linear element, but the steps in the development 
of the stiffness matrices are the same. We will briefly discuss these elements after examining 
the linear plane element formulation.

Step 1  Select Element Type
First, the natural s-t coordinates are attached to the element, with the origin at the center of the 
element, as shown in Figure 10–3(a). The s and t axes need not be orthogonal, and neither has 
to be parallel to the x or y axis. The orientation of s-t coordinates is such that the four corner 
nodes and the edges of the quadrilateral are bounded by 1

allow us to take advantage more fully of common numerical integration schemes.
We consider the quadrilateral to have eight degrees of freedom, u1, v1, . . . , u4, and v4 asso-
ciated with the global x and y directions. The element then has straight sides but is otherwise 
of arbitrary shape, as shown in Figure 10–3(b).
For the special case when the distorted element becomes a rectangular element with sides 
parallel to the global x – y coordinates, the s-t coordinates can be related to the global element 
coordinates x and y by

The shape functions of Eqs. (10.2.5) are linear. These shape functions are seen to map the s and 
t coordinates of any point in the square element of Figure 10–3(a) to those x and y ­coordinates 
in the quadrilateral element of Figure 10–3(b). For instance, consider square element node 1  
coordinates, where s

coordinates x

We further observe that the shape functions in Eq. (10.2.5) are again such that N1 through 
N4 have the properties that N

1, 2, 3, 4,)

 is equal to one at node i and equal to zero at all 
other nodes. The physical shapes of Ni as they vary over the element with natural coordinates

Until this point in the discussion, we have always developed the element shape functions 
either by assuming some relationship between the natural and global coordinates in terms of 
the generalized coordinates ai
( ’s) as in Eqs. (10.2.2) or, similarly, by assuming a displace-
ment function in terms of the ai’s. However, physical intuition  can often guide us in directly 
expressing shape functions based on the following two criteria set forth in Section 3.2 and used 
on numerous occasions:

on Lagrangian interpolation when displacement continuity is to be satisfied, or on Hermitian 
interpolation when additional slope continuity needs to be satisfied, as in the beam element of 
Chapter 4. (For a description of the use of Lagrangian and Hermitian interpolation to develop 
shape functions, consult References [4] and [6].)

where u and v are displacements parallel to the global x and y coordinates, and the shape func-
tions are given by Eqs. (10.2.5). The displacement of an interior point P located at x y
( , ) in the 
element of Figure 10–3(b) is described by u and v in Eq.  (10.2.7).
Comparing Eqs. (6.6.6) and (10.2.7), we see similarities between the rectangular element 
with sides of lengths 2b and 2h (Figure 6–20) and the square element with sides of length 2. If 
we let b

Step 3 Define the Strain–Displacement and Stress/Strain Relationships
Recall for the Q4 rectangle element described in Section 6.6 and Eq. (6.6.7b), that the strains 
are given in global coordinates by

So we observe that x
«  varies with the y coordinate but not with the x coordinate, and y
«  varies 
with the x coordinate but not with the y coordinate as shown in Figure 10–5. So the normal 
strain «x not vary along the length of the element. This element then will not accurately model 
a varying moment in a beam unless many elements are used throughout the length and depth 
of the beam, as demonstrated in Table 6-1.
We now want to formulate element matrix B
[ ] to evaluate k
[ ] for a general shaped quad-
rilateral. However, because it becomes tedious and difficult (if not impossible) to write the 
shape functions in terms of the x and y coordinates, as seen in Chapter 8, we will carry out the 
formulation in terms of the isoparametric coordinates s and t. This may appear tedious, but it is 
easier to use the s- and t-coordinate expressions than to attempt to use the x- and y-coordinate 
expressions. This approach also leads to a simple computer program formulation.
To construct an element stiffness matrix, we must determine the strains, which are defined 
in terms of the derivatives of the displacements with respect to the x and y coordinates. The 
displacements, however, are now functions of the s and t coordinates, as given by Eq. (10.2.7), 
with the shape functions given by Eqs. (10.2.5). Before, we could determine

x

 and 
f
y
(

, where, in general, ƒ is a function representing the displacement functions u or v. 
However, u and v are now expressed in terms of s and t. Therefore, we need to apply the chain 
rule of differentiation because it will not be possible to express s and t as functions of x and y 
directly. For ƒ as a function of x and y, the chain rule yields

We observe that J

Hence, B
[ ] is a function of s and t in both the numerator and the denominator [because of J

given by Eq. (10.2.22)] and of the known global coordinates x1 through y4.

we must integrate with respect to s and t. Once again, to transform the variables and the region 
from x and y to s and t, we must have a standard procedure that involves the determinant of 
[J]. This general type of transformation [4, 5] is given by

where the inclusion of J
|[ ]| in the integrand on the right side of Eq. (10.2.26) results from a 
theorem of integral calculus (see Reference [5] for the complete proof of this theorem). We 
also observe that the Jacobian (the determinant of the Jacobian matrix) relates an element area 
(dx dy) in the global coordinate system to an elemental area (ds dt) in the natural coordinate 
system. For rectangles and parallelograms, J is the constant value J

the physical surface area of the element. Using Eq. (10.2.26) in Eq. (10.2.25), we obtain

The J

numerically. A method for numerically integrating Eq. (10.2.27) is given in Section 10.3. The

Surface forces along other edges can be obtained similar to Eq. (10.2.30) by merely using the 
proper shape functions associated with the edge where the tractions are applied.
EXAMPLE 10.1
For the four-noded linear plane quadrilateral element shown in Figure 10–7 with a uniform 
surface traction along side 2–3, evaluate the force matrix by using the energy equivalent 
nodal forces obtained from the integral similar to Eq. (10.2.29). Let the thickness of the 
element be h 5 0.25 cm.

	10.3 	 Newton-Cotes and Gaussian Quadrature
In this section, we will describe two methods for numerical evaluation of definite integrals, 
because it has proven most useful for finite element work.
We begin with the simpler more common integration method of Newton-Cotes. The 
­Newton-Cotes methods for one and two intervals of integration are the well-known trapezoid 
and Simpson’s one-third rule, respectively. We will then describe Gauss’ method for numerical 
evaluation of definite integrals. After describing both methods, we will then understand why 
the Gaussian quadrature method is used in finite element work.
Newton-Cotes Numerical Integration
We first describe the common numerical integration method called the Newton-Cotes method 
for evaluation of definite integrals. However, the method does not yield as accurate of results 
as the Gaussian quadrature method and so is not normally used in finite element method eval-
uations, such as to evaluate the stiffness matrix.
To evaluate the integral

we assume the sampling points of y x
( ) are spaced at equal intervals. Since the limits of inte-
gration are from 21 to 1 using the isoparametric formulation, the Newton-Cotes formula is 
given by

where the Ci are the Newton-Cotes constants for numerical integration with i intervals (the 
number of intervals will be one less than the number of sampling points, n) and h is the interval 
between the limits of integration (for limits of integration between 21 and 1 this makes h
2
5 ). 
The Newton-Cotes constants have been published and are summarized in Table 10–1 for i
1
5  
to 6. The case i
1
5  corresponds to the well-known trapezoid rule illustrated by Figure 10–8. 
The case i
2
5  corresponds to the well-known Simpson one-third rule. It is shown [9] that 
the formulas for i
3
5  and i
5
5  have the same accuracy as the formulas for i
2
5  and i
4
5
, 
respectively. Therefore, it is recommended that the even formulas with i
2
5  and i
4
5
 be 
used in practice. To obtain greater accuracy one can then use a smaller interval (include more 
evaluations of the function to be integrated). This can be accomplished by using a higher-order 
Newton-Cotes formula, thus increasing the number of intervals i.
It is shown [9] that we need to use n equally spaced sampling points to integrate exactly a 
polynomial of order at most n

2 . On the other hand, using Gaussian quadrature we will show

that we use unequally spaced sampling points n and integrate exactly a polynomial of order at 
most n

1
2 . For instance, using the Newton-Cotes formula with n
2
5
 sampling points, the 
highest order polynomial we can integrate exactly is a linear one. However, using Gaussian 
quadrature, we can integrate a cubic polynomial exactly. Gaussian quadrature is then more 
accurate with fewer sampling points than Newton-Cotes quadrature. This is because Gaussian 
quadrature is based on optimizing the position of the sampling points (not making them equally 
spaced as in the Newton-Cotes method) and also optimizing the weights Wi given in Table 10–2.

10.3  Newton-Cotes and Gaussian Quadrature

After the function is evaluated at the sampling points, the corresponding weights are 
­multiplied by these evaluated functions as is illustrated in Example 10.3.
Example 10.2 is used to illustrate the Newton-Cotes method and compare its accuracy to 
that of the Gaussian quadrature method subsequently described.

That is, to approximate the integral, we evaluate the function at several sampling points n, mul-
tiply each value yi by the appropriate weight Wi, and add the terms. Gauss’s method chooses the 
sampling points so that for a given number of points, the best possible accuracy is obtained. Sam-
pling points are located symmetrically with respect to the center of the interval. Symmetrically 
paired points are given the same weight Wi. Table 10–2 gives appropriate sampling points and 
weighting  coefficients for the first three orders—that is, one, two, or three sampling points (see 
Reference [2] for more complete tables). For example, using two points (Figure 10–10), we simply 
have I

 is a polynomial 
containing terms up to and including x3. In general, Gaussian quadrature using n points (Gauss 
points) is exact if the integrand is a polynomial of degree 2n 2 1 or less. In using n points, we 
effectively replace the given function y 5 f(x) by a polynomial of degree 2n 2 1. The accuracy of 
the numerical integration depends on how well the polynomial fits the given curve.

10.3  Newton-Cotes and Gaussian Quadrature
507
If the function f x
( ) is not a polynomial, Gaussian quadrature is inexact, but it becomes 
more accurate as more Gauss points are used. Also, it is important to understand that the ratio 
of two polynomials is, in general, not a polynomial; therefore, Gaussian quadrature will not 
yield exact integration of the ratio.

In Eq. (10.3.13), we need not use the same number of Gauss points in each direction (that is,

We have shown in Section 10.2 that k

terms of a local set of coordinates s-t, with limits from minus one to one within the element, 
and in terms of global nodal coordinates as given by Eq. (10.2.27). We repeat Eq. (10.2.27)

[ ] [ ][ ] [ ]  must be evaluated by numerical integration in the

A flowchart to evaluate [k] of Eq. (10.4.2) for an element using four-point Gaussian 
quadrature is given in Figure 10–12. When we use the four-point rule for the four-noded quad-
rilateral (Q4 element), this is called “full integration” as full integration refers to the number 
of Gauss points required to integrate the polynomial terms in an element’s stiffness matrix 
exactly when the element has a regular shape, such as the rectangular element. Furthermore, 
the Q4 fully integrated linear element then requires two integration points in each direction. 
The four-point Gaussian quadrature rule is relatively easy to use. Also, it has been shown to

Evaluation of Element Stresses
The stresses 
D B d
{ }
[ ][ ]{ }
s 5
 are not constant within the quadrilateral element. Because [B] is 
a function of s and t coordinates, { }
s  is also a function of s and t. In practice, the stresses are 
evaluated at the same Gauss points used to evaluate the stiffness matrix [k]. For a quadrilateral 
using 2
2
3  integration, we get four sets of stress data. To reduce the data, it is often practical 
to evaluate { }
s  at s
0
5
, t
0
5
 instead. Another method mentioned in Section 7.4 is to evaluate 
the stresses in all elements at a shared (common) node and then use an average of these element 
nodal stresses to represent the stress at the node. Most computer programs use this method. 
Stress plots obtained in these programs are based on this average nodal stress method. Example 
10.5 illustrates the use of Gaussian quadrature to evaluate the stress matrix at the s
0
5
, t
0
5
 
location of the element.

	10.5 	 Higher-Order Shape Functions (Including Q6, Q8, 
Q9, and Q12 Elements)
In general, higher-order element shape functions can be developed by adding additional nodes 
to the sides of the linear element. These elements result in higher-order strain variations within 
each element, and convergence to the exact solution thus occurs at a faster rate using fewer 
elements. (However, a trade-off exists because a more complicated element takes up so much 
computation time that even with few elements in the model, the computation time can become 
larger than for the simple linear element model.) Another advantage of the use of higher-order 
elements is that curved boundaries of irregularly shaped bodies can be approximated more 
closely than by the use of simple straight-sided linear elements.
Linear Strain Bar
To illustrate the concept of higher-order elements, we will begin with the three-noded ­linear 
strain quadratic displacement (and quadratic shape functions) shown in Figure 10–14. 
­Figure 10–14 shows a quadratic isoparametric bar element (also called a linear strain bar) 
with three coordinates of nodes, x1, x2, and x3, in the global coordinates.
EXAMPLE 10.6
For the three-noded linear strain bar isoparametric element shown in Figure 10–14, 
determine (a) the shape functions, N1, N2, and N3, and (b) the strain-displacement 
matrix [B]. Assume the general axial displacement function to be a quadratic taken as

multiply each term by its weight (here each weight is 1). We then add those Gauss point 
evaluations together to obtain the final term for each element of the stiffness matrix. For 
two-point evaluation, there will be two terms added together to obtain each element of the 
stiffness matrix. We proceed to evaluate the stiffness matrix term by term as follows:

Equation (10.5.26) is identical to Eq. (10.5.22) obtained analytically by direct explicit inte-
gration of each term in the stiffness matrix.
To further illustrate elements with improved physical behavior, we start with the Q6 ele-
ment, and then to further illustrate the concept of higher-order elements, we will consider the 
quadratic (Q8 and Q9) elements and cubic (Q12) element shape functions, as described in 
References [3] and [8]. We then compare results in Figure 10–20 for a cantilever beam meshed 
with the numerous element types described in this and previous chapters, such as the CST, Q4, 
Q6, Q8, and Q9 elements.

where shape functions Ni are given by Eq. (10.2.5)
The displacement field is enhanced by modes that describe the state of constant curvature 
(also called bubble modes) that are represented by g1 through g4 in Eq. (10.5.27) These correc-
tions allow the elements to curve between the nodes and can then model bending with either s 
or t axis as the neutral axis. These modes are shown in Figure 10–16. The magnitude of these 
modes is determined by minimizing the internal strain energy in the element. The additional 
degrees of freedom are condensed out before the element stiffness matrix is developed. Hence, 
only the degrees of freedom associated with the four corner nodes appear. The element can 
model pure bending exactly if it is a rectangular shape.
This element appears to be used in computer programs such as Autodesk [11] as you 
have the choice of using compatible modes or incompatible modes in the Autodesk program. 
However, the compatible modes option is really the Q4 element while the incompatible modes 
option is the Q6 element, although not mentioned as such within the computer program. The 
incompatible modes option is recommended in most cases and as such yields much better 
answers for bending problems as shown in Table 10–3. Because the g1–g4 degrees of freedom 
are internal and not nodal degrees of freedom, they are not connected to other elements. There 
is then the possibility that the edges of two adjacent elements may have different curvatures 
and thus the displacement field along this common edge may be incompatible. Hence, modes 
associated with the g degrees of freedom are incompatible, and that is why the element is also 
called incompatible. This incompatibility will occur under certain loading conditions, such as 
shown in Figure 10–17. For more on this Q6 element, see References [9 and 10].

10  |  Isoparametric Formulation

Quadratic Rectangle (Q8 and Q9)
Figure 10–18 shows a quadratic isoparametric element with four corner nodes and four addi-
tional midside nodes. This eight-noded element is often called a “Q8” element.
The shape functions of the quadratic element are based on the incomplete cubic polyno-
mial such that coordinates x and y are

(10.5.28)
These functions have been chosen so that the number of generalized degrees of freedom (2 per 
node times 8 nodes equals 16) are identical to the total number of ai’s. The literature also refers 
to this eight-noded element as a “serendipity” element as it is based on an incomplete cubic, 
but it yields good results in such cases as beam bending. We are also reminded that because 
we are considering an isoparametric formulation, displacements u and v are of identical form 
as x and y, respectively, in Eq. (10.5.28).
To describe the shape functions, two forms are required—one for corner nodes and one for 
midside nodes, as given in Reference [3]. For the corner nodes i 5

We can develop the matrix [B] using Eq. (10.2.17) with D
[
]9  from Eq. (10.2.16) and with N
[
] 
now the 2
16
3
 matrix given in Eq. (10.5.34), where the N’s are defined in explicit form by 
Eq. (10.5.29) and (10.5.32).
To evaluate the matrix [B] and the matrix [k] for the eight-noded quadratic isoparametric 
element, we now use the nine-point Gauss rule (often described as a 3
3
3  rule). Results using 
2
2
3  and 3
3
3  rules have shown significant differences, and the 3
3
3  rule is recommended 
by Bathe and Wilson [7]. Table 10–2 indicates the locations of points and the associated 
weights. The 3
3
3  rule is shown in Figure 10–19.
By adding a ninth node at s
0
5
, t
0
5
 in Figure 10–18, we can create an element called a 
“Q9”. This is an internal node that is not connected to any other nodes. We then add the a s t
17 2 2 
and a s t
18 2 2 terms to x and y, respectively in Eq. (10.5.28) and to u and v. The element is then 
called a Lagrange element as the shape functions can be derived using Lagrange interpolation 
formulas. For more on this subject consult [8].
We now present a comparison of results for a cantilever beam meshed with the various 
plane elements as described in this and previous chapters 6 and 8. These results are shown 
in Figure 10–20. In Figure 10–20, the CST, Q4, Q6, Q8, and Q9 element mesh solutions are 
compared to the classical beam element. Note that the Q6 element (or Q4 incompatible) as 
offered in Autodesk and other computer programs removes the shear locking that occurs with 
the Q4 element and yields excellent results for the displacement even with a single row of rect-
angular elements as shown in Figure 10-20(c). However, small angles of trapezoidal distortion 
(say 158 from the vertical) make the elements much too stiff, as shown by the Figure 10-20(d) 
result. Also parallel distortion reduces accuracy of the elements but to a smaller amount than 
the trapezoidal distortion, as shown in Figure 10–20(e). The Q8 and Q9 elements perform 
very well considering only one row and two elements or fewer total degrees of freedom (d.o.f) 
are used compared to the Q6 mesh [see Figures 10–20(f) and (g)]. The Q9 element with the 
additional internal node yields slightly better single row results than the Q8. Again the CST 
[Figure 10–20(a)] and Q4 single row compatible element [Figure 10–20(b)] yield the worst 
results die to shear locking, as described previously in Sections 6.6 and 8.3.
We should also realize that the standard two-noded beam element described in ­Chapter 4 
yields an exact result for the free end displacement despite having only two nonzero degrees of

This model emphasizes the power of the beam element for modeling beams, such as the can-
tilever, when stress concentrations are not of concern.
Cubic Rectangle (Q12)
Finally, the cubic (Q12) element in Figure 10–21 has four corner nodes and additional nodes 
taken to be at one-third and two-thirds of the length along each side. The shape functions of 
the cubic element (as derived in Reference [3]) are based on the incomplete quartic polynomial

Having the shape functions for the quadratic element given by Eqs. (10.5.29) and 
(10.5.32) or for the cubic element given by Eqs. (10.5.36) through (10.5.38), we can again use 
Eq. (10.2.17) to obtain [B] and then Eq. (10.2.27) to set up [k] for numerical integration for the 
plane element. The cubic element requires a 3
3
3  rule (nine points) to evaluate the matrix [k] 
exactly. We then conclude that what is really desired is a library of shape functions that can be 
used in the general equations developed for stiffness matrices, distributed load, and body force 
and can be applied not only to stress analysis but to nonstructural problems as well.
Since in this discussion the element shape functions Ni relating x and y to nodal coordi-
nates xi and yi are of the same form as the shape functions relating u and v to nodal displace-
ments ui and vi, this is said to be an isoparametric formulation. For instance, for the linear 
element 
∑

i
i

 and the displacement function 
∑
u
N u
i i
i

4

, use the same shape 
functions Ni given by Eq. (10.2.5). If instead the shape functions for the coordinates are of 
lower order (say, linear for x) than the shape functions used for displacements (say, quadratic 
for u), this is called a subparametric formulation.
Finally, referring to Figure 10–21, note that an element can have a linear shape along, 
say, one edge (1–2), a quadratic along, say, two edges (2–3 and 1–4), and a cubic along the 
other edge (3–4). Hence, the simple linear element can be mixed with different higher-order 
elements in regions of a model where rapid stress variation is expected. The advantage of the 
use of higher-order elements is further illustrated in Reference [3].

Three-Dimensional Stress 
Analysis
Chapter Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Introduce concepts of three-dimensional stress and strain.
■ Develop the tetrahedral solid-element stiffness matrix.
■ Describe how body and surface tractions are treated.
■ Illustrate a numerical example of the tetrahedral element stiffness matrix.
■ Describe the isoparametric formulation of the stiffness matrix for three­dimensional 
hexahedral (brick) elements, including the linear (eight-noded) brick, and the qua-
dratic (20 noded) brick.
■ Present some commercial computer program examples of three-dimensional solid 
models and results for real-world applications.
■ Present a comparison of the four-noded tetrahedral, the ten-noded tetrahedral, the 
eight-noded brick, and the twenty-noded brick.
Introduction
In this chapter, we consider the three-dimensional, or solid, element. This element is useful 
for the stress analysis of general three-dimensional bodies that require more precise analysis 
than is possible through two-dimensional and/or axisymmetric analysis. Examples of three-­
dimensional problems are arch dams, thick-walled pressure vessels, and solid forging parts as 
used, for instance, in the heavy equipment and automotive industries. Figure 11–1 shows finite 
element models of some typical automobile parts and a subsoiler used in agricultural equip-
ment. Also see Figure 1–7 for a model of a swing casting for a backhoe frame, Figure 1–9 for 
a model of a pelvis bone with an implant, and Figures 11–7 through 11–10 of a forging part, 
a foot pedal, a trailer hitch, and an alternator bracket, respectively.
The tetrahedron is the basic three-dimensional element, and it is used in the development 
of the shape functions, stiffness matrix, and force matrices in terms of a global coordinate 
system. We follow this development with the isoparametric formulation of the stiffness matrix 
for the hexahedron, or brick element. Finally, we will provide some typical three-dimensional 
applications.

11.1  Three-Dimensional Stress and Strain
537
In the last section of this chapter, we show some three-dimensional problems solved using 
a computer program.
	11.1 	 Three-Dimensional Stress and Strain
We begin by considering the three-dimensional infinitesimal element in Cartesian coordinates 
with dimensions dx, dy, and dz and normal and shear stresses as shown in Figure 11–2. This 
element conveniently represents the state of stress on three mutually perpendicular planes of 
a body in a state of three-dimensional stress. As usual, normal stresses are perpendicular to 
the faces of the element and are represented by 
x
s , 
y
s , and 
z
s . Shear stresses act in the faces 
(planes) of the element and are represented by τxy, τyz, τzx, and so on.
From moment equilibrium of the element, we show in Appendix C that

	11.2 	 Tetrahedral Element
We now develop the tetrahedral stress element stiffness matrix by again using the steps out-
lined in Chapter 1. The development is seen to be an extension of the plane element previously 
described in Chapter 6. This extension was suggested in References [1] and [2].
Step 1 Select Element Type
Consider the tetrahedral element shown in Figure 11–3 with corner nodes 1–4. This element is 
a four-noded solid. The nodes of the element must be numbered such that when viewed from 
the last node (say, node 4), the first three nodes are numbered in a counterclockwise manner, 
such as 1, 2, 3, 4 or 2, 3, 1, 4. This ordering of nodes avoids the calculation of negative volumes 
and is consistent with the counterclockwise node numbering associated with the CST element 
in Chapter 6. (Using an isoparametric formulation to evaluate the [k] matrix for the tetrahe-
dral element enables us to use the element node numbering in any order. The isoparametric 
formulation of [k] is left

Hence, there are 3 degrees of freedom per node, or 12 total degrees of freedom per 
element.
Step 2 Select Displacement Functions
For a compatible displacement field, the element displacement functions u, v, and w must be 
linear along each edge because only two points (the corner nodes) exist along each edge, and 
the functions must be linear in each plane side of the tetrahedron. We then select the linear 
displacement functions as

	11.3 	 Isoparametric Formulation and Hexahedral Element
We now describe the isoparametric formulation of the stiffness matrix for some three–­
dimensional hexahedral (brick) elements.
Linear Hexahedral Element
The basic (linear) hexahedral element [Figure 11–5(a)] now has eight corner nodes with iso-
parametric natural coordinates given by s, t, and z9 as shown in Figure 11–5(b). The element 
faces are now defined by s, t, z9 5 61. (We use s, t, and z9 for the coordinate axes because they 
are probably simpler to use than Greek letters j, h, and z).
The formulation of the stiffness matrix follows steps analogous to the isoparametric for-
mulation of the stiffness matrix for the plane element in Chapter 10.
The function used to describe the element geometry for x in terms of the generalized 
degrees of freedom ai s is

The same form as Eq. (11.3.1) is used for y and z as well. Just start with a9 through a16 for 
y and a17 through a24 for z.
First, we expand Eq. (10.2.4) to include the z coordinate as follows:

Explicit forms of the other shape functions follow similarly. The shape functions in Eq. (11.3.3) 
map the natural coordinates (s, t, z9) of any point in the element to any point in the global 
coordinates (x, y, z) when used in Eq. (11.3.2). For instance, when we let i 5 8 and substitute 
s 5 1

(11.3.5b)
Similar expressions are obtained for the other shape functions. Then evaluating all shape func-
tions at node 8, we obtain N 5 1

, and all other shape functions equal zero at node 8. [From 
Eq. (11.3.5a), we see that N 5 0

 when s 5 1 or when t 5 1.] Therefore, using Eq. (11.3.2), 
we obtain

We see that indeed Eq. (11.3.2) maps any point in the natural-coordinate system to one in the 
global-coordinate system.

Using Eqs. (11.3.8) by substituting u, v, and then w for f and using the definitions of the strains, 
we can express the strains in terms of natural coordinates (s, t, z9) to obtain an equation similar 
to Eq. (10.2.14). In compact form, we can again express the strains in terms of the shape func-
tions and global nodal coordinates similar to Eq. (10.2.15). The matrix [B], given by a form 
similar to Eq. (10.2.17), is now a function of s, t, and z9 and is of order 3

Again, it is best to evaluate [k] by numerical integration (also see Section 10.3); that is, we 
evaluate (integrate) the eight-node hexahedral element stiffness matrix using a 3

2 rule 
(or two-point rule). Actually, eight points defined in Table 11–1 are used to evaluate [k] as

As is true with the bilinear quadrilateral element described in Section 10.2, the eight-noded 
linear hexahedral element cannot model beam-bending action well because the element sides 
remain straight during the element deformation. During the bending process, the elements will 
be stretched and can shear lock. This concept of shear locking was introduced in Section 6.6 
and again described in Section 10.5 with ways to remedy it. More details regarding shear 
locking along with ways to remedy it are provided in [12]. However, the quadratic hexahedral 
element described subsequently remedies the shear locking problem.
Quadratic Hexahedral Element
For the quadratic hexahedral element shown in Figure 11–6, we have a total of 20 nodes with 
the inclusion of a total of 12 midside nodes.

Similar expressions describe the y and z coordinates.
The x-displacement function u is described by the same polynomial used for the x element 
geometry in Eq. (11.3.10). Similar expressions are used for displacement functions v and w. In 
order to satisfy interelement compatibility, the three cubic terms s3, t3, and z9 3 are not included. 
Instead the three quartic terms s tz9
2
, st z9
2 , and stz9 2 are used.
The development of the stiffness matrix follows the same steps we outlined before for the 
linear hexahedral element, where the shape functions now take on new forms. Again, letting

The [B] matrix is now a 60
60 matrix

. Therefore, using Eq. (11.3.9a), the stiffness 
matrix of the quadratic hexahedral element is of order 
3
60
60. This is consistent with the fact 
that the element has 20 nodes and 3 degrees of freedom (ui, vi, and wi) per node.

3 rule (27 points). However, a special 14-point rule may be a better choice [9, 10].
As with the eight-noded plane element of Section 10.5 (Figure 10–18), the 20-node solid 
element is also called a serendipity element.
Figures 1–7 and 11–7 show applications of the use of linear and quadratic (curved sides) 
solid elements to model three-dimensional solids.
Finally, commercial computer programs, such as [11] (also see references [46–56] of 
Chapter 1), are available to solve three-dimensional problems. Figures 11–8, 11–9, and 11–10 
show a steel foot pedal, a trailer hitch, and an alternator bracket solved using a computer pro-
gram [11]. We emphasize that these problems have been solved using the three-dimensional

element as opposed to using a two-dimensional element, such as described in Chapters 6 and 8, 
as these problems have a three-dimensional stress state occurring in them. That is, the three 
normal and three shear stresses are of similar order of magnitude in some parts of the foot 
pedal, the trailer hitch, and the alternator bracket. The most accurate results will then occur 
when modeling these problems using the three-dimensional brick or tetrahedral elements (or 
a combination of both).
For the foot pedal, modeled with brick elements, the largest von Mises stress was 71.1 MPa 
located at the interior corner of the elbow. The maximum displacement was 0.439 mm down at 
the front free end corner. (See Problem 11.14 for detailed dimensions and material properties 
used.)

11  |  Three-Dimensional Stress Analysis

For the steel trailer hitch shown in Figure 11–9, subjected to both a lateral and downward 
load of 12.59 kN each on the ball, the largest von Mises stress away from the unrealistic high 
stress located at the point load that was applied at the base of the ball is 406.75 MPa located 
at the inside re-entrant curve of the hitch. The largest displacement magnitude was 1.52 mm 
located at the top of the ball. This displacement magnitude also matches the value obtained 
through experimental testing of the hitch under the same load conditions used in the finite 
element analysis.
For the alternator bracket made of ASTM-A36 hot-rolled steel, the model consisted of 
13,298 solid brick elements and 10,425 nodes. A total load of 4.45 kN was applied downward 
to the flat front face piece. The bracket back side was constrained against displacement. The 
largest von Mises stress was 79.54 MPa located at the top surface near the center (narrowest) 
section of the bracket. The largest vertical deflection was 0.412 mm at the front tip of the outer 
edge of the alternator bracket.
It has been shown [3] that use of the simple eight-noded hexahedral element yields bet-
ter results than use of the constant-strain tetrahedral discussed in Section 11.1. Table 11.2 
also illustrates the comparison between the corner-noded (constant-strain) tetrahedral, the 
linear-strain tetrahedral (10 nodes with mid-edge nodes added), the 8-noded brick, and the 
20-noded brick models for a three-dimensional cantilever beam of length 2.54 m, base 15.24 
cm, and height 30.48 cm. The beam has an end load of 44.48 kN acting upward and is made 
of steel (
210 GPa)

. A typical 8-noded brick model with the principal stress plot is shown 
in Figure 11–11. The classical beam theory solution for the vertical displacement and bending 
stress is also included for comparison. We can observe that the constant-strain tetrahedral gives

Summary Equations
very poor results, whereas the linear tetrahedral gives much better results. This is because the 
linear-strain model predicts the beam-bending behavior much better. The 8-noded and 20-noded 
brick models yield similar but accurate results compared to the classical beam theory results.
In summary, the use of the three-dimensional elements results in a large number of equa-
tions to be solved simultaneously. For instance, a model using a simple cube with, say, 20 by 
20 by 20 nodes 5
(
8000 total nodes) for a region requires 8000 times 3 degrees of freedom per 
node 5
(
24,000) simultaneous equations.
References [4–7] report on early three-dimensional programs and analysis procedures 
using solid elements such as a family of subparametric curvilinear elements, linear tetrahedral 
elements, and 8-noded linear and 20-noded quadratic isoparametric elements.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Introduce basic concepts of plate bending.
■ Derive a common plate bending element stiffness matrix.
■ Present some plate element numerical comparisons.
■ Demonstrate some computer solutions for plate bending problems.
Introduction
In this chapter, we will begin by describing elementary concepts of plate bending behavior and 
theory. The plate element is one of the more important structural elements and is used to model 
and analyze such structures as pressure vessels, chimney stacks (Figure 1–5), and automobile 
parts. Figure 12–1 shows finite element models of a computer case and a water tank modeled 
using the plate bending element described in this chapter. This description of plate bending is 
followed by a discussion of some commonly used plate finite elements. A large number of plate 
bending element formulations exist that would require a lengthy chapter to cover. Our purpose 
in this chapter is to present the derivation of the stiffness matrix for one of the most common 
plate bending finite elements and then to compare solutions to some classical problems from 
a variety of bending elements in the literature.
We finish the chapter with a solution to a plate bending problem using a computer program.
	12.1 	 Basic Concepts of Plate Bending
A plate can be considered the two-dimensional extension of a beam in simple bending. Both 
beams and plates support loads transverse or perpendicular to their plane and through bending 
action. A plate is flat (if it were curved, it would become a shell). A beam has a single bending 
moment resistance, while a plate resists bending about two axes and has a twisting moment.
We will consider the classical thin-plate theory or Kirchhoff plate theory [1]. Many of the 
assumptions of this theory are analogous to the classical beam theory or Euler–Bernoulli beam 
theory described in Chapter 4 and in Reference [2].

12.1  Basic Concepts of Plate Bending
573
Basic Behavior of Geometry and Deformation
We begin the derivation of the basic thin-plate equations by considering the thin plate in the 
x – y plane and of thickness t measured in the z direction shown in Figure 12–2. The plate sur-
faces are at z
t ⁄ 2
5 6
, and its midsurface is at z
0
5 . The assumed basic geometry of the plate 
is as follows: (1) The plate thickness is much smaller than its in-plane dimensions b and c (that 
is, t
b
,,  or c). (If t is more than about one-tenth the span of the plate, then transverse shear 
deformation must be accounted for and the plate is then said to be thick.) (2) The deflection  w  
is much less than the thickness t (that is, w t/
1
,, ).
Kirchhoff Assumptions
Consider a differential slice cut from the plate by planes perpendicular to the x axis as 
shown in Figure 12–3(a). Loading q causes the plate to deform laterally or upward in

 and the plate does not stretch in the z direction. A line a-b 
drawn ­perpendicular to the plate surfaces before loading remains perpendicular to the 
surfaces after loading [Figure 12–3(b)]. This is consistent with the Kirchhoff assumptions 
as follows:

The in-plane normal stresses and shear stress are shown acting on the edges of the plate in 
Figure 12–4(a). Similar to the stress variation in a beam, these stresses vary linearly in the 
z direction from the midsurface of the plate. The transverse shear stresses τ yz and τ xz are also 
present, even though transverse shear deformation is neglected. As in beam theory, these trans-
verse stresses vary quadratically through the plate thickness. The stresses of Eq. (12.1.5) can 
be related to the bending moments Mx and My and to the twisting moment Mxy acting along 
the edges of the plate as shown in Figure 12–4(b).
The moments are actually functions of x and y and are computed per unit length in the 
plane of the plate so have units of N-m/m. Therefore, the moments are

third of Eqs. (12.1.9), then solving those equations for Qx and Qy, and finally substituting the

(12.1.10)
From Eq. (12.1.10), we observe that the solution of thin-plate bending using a displacement 
point of view depends on selection of the single-displacement component w, the transverse 
displacement.
If we neglect the differentiation with respect to the y coordinate, Eq. (12.1.10) simplifies 
to Eq. (4.1.1g) for a beam (where the flexural rigidity D of the plate reduces to EI of the beam 
when the Poisson effect is set to zero and the plate width becomes unity).

Matrix and Equations
Numerous finite elements for plate bending have been developed over the years, and Reference [3] 
cites 88 different elements. In this section we will introduce only one element formulation, the basic 
12-degrees-of-freedom rectangular element shown in Figure 12–5. For more details of this for-
mulation and of various other formulations including triangular elements, see References [4–18].

The formulation will be developed consistently with the stiffness matrix and equations 
for the bar, beam, plane stress/strain, axisymmetric, and solid elements of previous chapters.
Step 1 Select Element Type
We will consider the 12-degrees-of-freedom flat-plate bending element shown in Figure 12–5. 
Each node has 3 degrees of freedom—a transverse displacement w in the z direction, a rotation 
x
u  about the x axis, and a rotation y
u  about the y axis.
The nodal displacement matrix at node i is given by

Equation (12.2.4) is an incomplete quartic in the context of the Pascal triangle (Figure 8–2). 
The function is complete up to the third order (ten terms), and a choice of two more terms from 
the remaining five terms of a complete quartic must be made. The best choice is the x y

xy3 terms as they ensure that we will have continuity in displacement among the interelement 
boundaries. (The x4 and y4 terms would yield discontinuities of displacement along interele-
ment boundaries and so must be rejected. The x y
2
2 term is alone and cannot be paired with any 
other terms and so is also rejected.) The function [Eq. (12.2.4)] also satisfies the basic differ-
ential equation [Eq. (12.1.10)] over the unloaded part of the plate, although not a requirement 
in a minimum potential energy approximation.
Furthermore, the function allows for rigid-body motion and constant strain, as terms are 
present to account for these phenomena in a structure. However, interelement slope disconti-
nuities along common boundaries of elements are not ensured.
To observe this discontinuity in slope, we evaluate the polynomial and its slopes along a 
side or edge (say, along side i-j, the x axis of Figure 12–5). We then obtain

The displacement w is a cubic as used for the beam element, while the slope

 is the same 
as in beam bending. Based on the beam element, we recall that the four constants a1, a2, a4, 
and a7 can be defined by invoking the endpoint conditions of w

. Therefore, w 
and 

w
x

 are completely defined along this edge. The normal slope 

w
y
⁄
 is a cubic in x. 
However, only two degrees of freedom remain for definition of this slope, while four constants 
(a3, a5, a8, and a12) exist. This slope is then not uniquely defined, and a slope discontinuity 
occurs. Thus, the function for w is said to be nonconforming. The solution obtained from the 
finite element analysis using this element will not be a minimum potential energy solution. 
However, this element has proven to give acceptable results, and proofs of its convergence 
have been shown [8].
The constants a1 through a12 can be determined by expressing the 12 simultaneous equa-
tions linking the values of w and its slopes at the nodes when the coordinates take up their 
appropriate values. First, we write

The rest of the steps, including assembling the global equations, applying boundary condi-
tions (now boundary conditions on w, x
u , y
u ), and solving the equations for the nodal displace-
ments and slopes (note three degrees of freedom per node), follow the standard procedures 
introduced in previous chapters.
	12.3 	 Some Plate Element Numerical Comparisons
We now present some numerical comparisons of quadrilateral plate element formulations. 
Remember there are numerous plate element formulations in the literature. Figure 12–6 
shows a number of plate element formulation results for a square plate simply supported 
all around and subjected to a concentrated vertical load applied at the center of the plate. 
The results are shown to illustrate the upper and lower bound solution behavior and demon-
strate the convergence of solution for various plate element formulations. Included in these 
results is the 12-term polynomial described in Section 12.2. We note that the 12-term 
polynomial converges to the exact solution from above. It yields an upper bound solution. 
Because the interelement continuity of slopes is not ensured by the 12-term polynomial, 
the lower bound classical characteristic of a minimum potential energy formulation is 
not obtained. However, as more elements are used, the solution converges to the exact 
solution [1].

Figure 12–7 shows comparisons of triangular plate formulations for the same cen-
trally loaded simply supported plate used to compare quadrilateral element formulations in 
­Figure 12–6. We can observe from Figures 12–6 and 12–7 a number of different formulations 
with results that converge from above and below. Some of these elements produce better results 
than others.
The Autodesk program [19] uses, among others, the Veubeke (after Baudoin Fraeijs de 
Veubeke) 16-degrees-of-freedom “subdomain” formulation [7], which converges from below, 
as it is based on a compatible displacement formulation. For more information on some of 
these formulations, consult the references at the end of the chapter.
Finally, Figure 12–8 shows results for some selected Mindlin plate theory elements. 
Mindlin plate elements account for bending deformation and for transverse shear deformation. 
For more on Mindlin plate theory, see Reference [6]. The “heterosis” element [10] is the best 
performing element in Figure 12–8.

	12.4 	 Computer Solutions for Plate Bending Problems
A computer program solution for plant bending problems [19] is now illustrated in ­Example 12.1. 
The plate element is a three- or four-noded element formulated in three-­dimensional space. 
The element degrees of freedom allowed are all three translations (u, v, and w) and in-plane 
rotations ( x
u  and y
u ). The rotational degrees of freedom normal to the plate are undefined and 
must be constrained. The element formulated in the computer program is the 16-term polyno-
mial described in References [5] and [7]. This element is known as the Veubeke plate in the 
program. The 16-node formulation converges from below for the displacement analysis, as it 
is based on a compatible displacement formulation. This is also shown in ­Figure 12–6 for the 
clamped plate subjected to a concentrated center load.

	 A C-channel section (Figure P12–4) structural steel beam of 50 mm wide flanges, 
75 mm depth and thickness of both flanges and web of 6 mm is loaded as shown with 
500 N acting in the y direction on the free end. Determine the free end deflection 
and angle of twist. Now move the load in the z direction until the rotation (angle of 
twist) becomes zero.
	
	
	 This distance is called the shear center (the location where the force can be placed so 
that the cross section will bend but not twist). You will need to add a beam or plate 
element to the center of the web extended into the negative z direction and place the 
load at the end of this proper length beam. (See Table 5–1 for the equation for the 
shear center location.)

Introduction
In this chapter, we present the first use in this text of the finite element method for solution 
of nonstructural problems. We first consider the heat-transfer problem, although many similar 
problems, such as seepage through porous media, torsion of shafts, and magnetostatics [3], 
can also be treated by the same form of equations (but with different physical characteristics) 
as that for heat transfer.

Familiarity with the heat-transfer problem makes possible determination of the tempera-
ture distribution within a body. We can then determine the amount of heat moving into or out of 
the body and the thermal stresses. Figure 13–1 is an illustration of a three-dimensional model of 
a cylinder head with the temperature distribution shown throughout the head. The cylinder head 
is made of stainless steel AISI 410 and is part of a diesel engine that would provide reduced 
heat rejection and increased power density. The resulting temperature distribution reveals the 
high temperature of 
8
815 C in red color at the interface between the two exhaust ports. These 
temperatures were then fed into the linear stress analyzer to obtain the thermal stresses ranging 
from 585 MPa to 1380 MPa. The linear stress analysis confirmed the behavior that the engi-
neers saw in the initial prototype tests. The highest thermal stresses coincided with the part of 
the cylinder head that had been leaking in the preliminary prototypes.
We begin with a derivation of the basic differential equation for heat conduction in one 
dimension and then extend this derivation to the two-dimensional case. We will then review 
the units used for the physical quantities involved in heat transfer.
In preceding chapters dealing with stress analysis, we used the principle of minimum 
potential energy to derive the element equations, where an assumed displacement function 
within each element was used as a starting point in the derivation. We will now use a similar 
procedure for the nonstructural heat-transfer problem. We define an assumed temperature func-
tion within each element. Instead of minimizing a potential energy functional, we minimize 
a similar functional to obtain the element equations. Matrices analogous to the stiffness and 
force matrices of the structural problem result.
We will consider one-, two-, and three-dimensional finite element formulations of the 
heat-transfer problem and provide illustrative examples of the determination of the tempera-
ture distribution along the length of a rod and within a two-dimensional body and show some 
three-dimensional heat transfer examples as well.

13.1  Derivation of the Basic Differential Equation
601
Next, we will consider the contribution of fluid mass transport. The one-dimensional 
mass-transport phenomenon is included in the basic heat-transfer differential equation. Because 
it is not readily apparent that a variational formulation is possible for this problem, we will 
apply Galerkin’s residual method directly to the differential equation to obtain the finite ele-
ment equations. (You should note that the mass transport stiffness matrix is asymmetric.) We 
will compare an analytical solution to the finite element solution for a heat exchanger design/
analysis problem to show the excellent agreement.
Finally, we will present some computer program results for both two- and three-dimensional 
heat transfer.
	13.1 	 Derivation of the Basic Differential Equation
One-Dimensional Heat Conduction (without Convection)
We now consider the derivation of the basic differential equation for the one-dimensional 
problem of heat conduction without convection. The purpose of this derivation is to present a 
physical insight into the heat-transfer phenomena, which must be understood so that the finite 
element formulation of the problem can be fully understood. (For additional information on 
heat transfer, consult texts such as References [1] and [2].) We begin with the control volume 
shown in Figure 13–2. By conservation of energy, we have

the body.
	13.2 	 Heat Transfer with Convection
For a conducting solid in contact with a fluid, there will be a heat transfer taking place between 
the fluid and solid surface when a temperature difference occurs.
The fluid will be in motion either through external pumping action (forced convection) 
or through the buoyancy forces created within the fluid by the temperature differences within 
it (natural or free convection).
We will now consider the derivation of the basic differential equation for one-dimensional 
heat conduction with convection. Again we assume the temperature change is much greater in 
the x direction than in the y and z directions. Figure 13–6 shows the control volume used in the 
derivation. Again, by Eq. (13.1.1) for conservation of energy, we have

Natural or free convection occurs when, for instance, a heated plate is exposed to ambi-
ent room air without an external source of motion. This movement of the air, experienced as 
a result of the density gradients near the plate, is called natural or free convection. Forced 
convection is experienced, for instance, in the case of a fan blowing air over a plate.

13.4  One-Dimensional Finite Element Formulation Using a Variational Method

	13.4 	 One-Dimensional Finite Element Formulation  
Using a Variational Method
The temperature distribution influences the amount of heat moving into or out of a body and 
also influences the stresses in a body. Thermal stresses occur in all bodies that experience a 
temperature gradient from some equilibrium state but are not free to expand in all directions. To 
evaluate thermal stresses, we need to know the temperature distribution in the body. The finite 
element method is a realistic method for predicting quantities such as temperature distribution 
and thermal stresses in a body. In this section, we formulate the one-dimensional heat-transfer 
equations using a variational method. Examples are included to illustrate the solution of this 
type of problem.
Step 1 Select Element Type
The basic element with nodes 1 and 2 is shown in Figure 13–8(a).
Step 2 Choose a Temperature Function
We choose the temperature function T [Figure 13–8(b)] within each element similar to the 
displacement function of Chapter 3, as
	
T x

with the prescribed nodal temperature boundary conditions given by Eq. (13.1.13). Note

actually accounted for in the same manner as distributed loading was accounted for in the 
stress analysis problem; that is, they are included in the column of force matrices through 
a consistent approach (using the same shape functions used to derive [k]), as given by  
Eqs. (13.4.2).
The heat-transfer problem is now amenable to solution by the finite element method. 
The procedure used for solution is similar to that for the stress analysis problem. In Section 
13.5, we will derive the specific equations used to solve the two-dimensional heat-transfer 
problem.

Step 6 Solve for the Nodal Temperatures
We now solve for the global nodal temperature, { }t , where the appropriate nodal temperature 
boundary conditions, Eq. (13.1.13), are specified.
Step 7 Solve for the Element Temperature Gradients and Heat Fluxes
Finally, we calculate the element temperature gradients from Eq. (13.4.6), and the heat fluxes, 
typically from Eq. (13.4.8).
To illustrate the use of the equations developed in this section, we will now solve some 
one-dimensional heat-transfer problems.
Example 13.1
Determine the temperature distribution along the length of the rod shown in Figure 13–10 
with an insulated perimeter. The temperature at the left end is a constant 
8
40 C, and the free-
stream temperature is 2
8
10 C. Let h 5

55 W/(m - C)
2
 and 
5
8
35 W/(m- C)
Kxx
. The value 
of h is typical for forced air convection and the value of Kxx is a typical conductivity for 
carbon steel (Tables 13–2 and 13–3).

SOLUTION:
The finite element discretization is shown in Figure 13–11. For simplicity’s sake, we will 
use four elements, each 0.25 m long. There will be convective heat loss only over the 
right end of the rod because we consider the left end to have a known temperature and the 
perimeter to be insulated. We calculate the stiffness matrices for each element as follows:

For this elementary problem, the closed-form solution of the differential equation for 
conduction, Eq. (13.1.9), with the left-end boundary condition given by Eq. (13.1.10) and 
the right-end boundary condition given by Eq. (13.2.4) yields a linear temperature distri-
bution through the length of the rod. The evaluation of this linear temperature function at 
0.25 m intervals (corresponding to the nodal points used in the finite element model) yields 
the same temperatures as obtained in this example by the finite element method. Because 
the temperature function was assumed to be linear in each finite element, this comparison 
is as expected. Note that 1
F  could be determined by the first of Eqs. (13.4.40).

Example 13.2
To illustrate more fully the use of the equations developed in Section 13.4, we will now solve 
the heat-transfer problem shown in Figure 13–12. For the one-dimensional rod, determine 
the temperatures at 75 mm increments along the length of the rod and the rate of heat flow 
through element 1. Let

SOLUTION:
The finite element discretization is shown in Figure 13–13. Three elements are sufficient to 
enable us to determine temperatures at the four points along the rod, although more elements 
would yield answers more closely approximating the analytical solution obtained by solving 
the differential equation such as Eq. (13.2.3) with the partial derivative with respect to time 
equal to zero. There will be convective heat loss over the perimeter and the right end of the 
rod. The left end will not have convective heat loss. Using Eqs. (13.4.22) and (13.4.28), we 
calculate the stiffness matrices for the elements as follows:

Because there is no convection across the ends of element 1 (its left end has a known tem-
perature and its right end is inside the whole rod and thus not exposed to fluid motion), the 
contribution to the stiffness matrix owing to convection from an end of the element, such 
as given by Eq. (13.4.28), is zero. Similarly,

13.4  One-Dimensional Finite Element Formulation Using a Variational Method 
619
SOLUTION:
This problem is assumed to be approximated as a one-dimensional heat-transfer problem. 
The discretized model of the wall is shown in Figure 13–15. For simplicity, we use four 
equal-length elements all with unit cross-sectional area 
5
(
1 m )
2
A
. The unit area represents 
a typical cross section of the wall. The perimeter of the wall model is then insulated to obtain 
the correct conditions.
Using Eqs. (13.4.22) and (13.4.28), we calculate the element stiffness matrices as 
follows:

the furnace wall thickness. We can then assume the cross-sectional area to be a unit slice

We will develop the equations in two ways. First, using the heat flow balance at each of 
the three nodes of the model shown in Figure 13–19 and then by using the direct stiffness 
method.

Finally, remember that the most important advantage of the finite element method is that 
it enables us to approximate, with high confidence, more complicated problems, such as those 
with more then one thermal conductivity, for which closed-form solutions are difficult (if not 
impossible) to obtain. The automation of the finite element method through general computer 
programs makes the method extremely powerful.

element then follow.
Step 1 Select Element Type
The three-noded triangular element with nodal temperatures shown in Figure 13–20 is the basic

with similar expressions for N j and Nm. Here the a’s, b’s, and g’s are defined by Eqs. (6.2.10).
Unlike the CST element of Chapter 6 where there are 2 degrees of freedom per node (an x 
and a y displacement), in the heat transfer three-noded triangular element only a single scalar 
value (nodal temperature) is the primary unknown at each node, as shown by Eq. (13.5.1). 
This holds true for the three-dimensional elements as well, as shown in Section 13.7. Hence, 
the heat-transfer problem is sometimes known as a scalar-valued boundary value problem.
Step 3 Define the Temperature Gradient / Temperature  
and Heat Flux / Temperature Gradient Relationships

SOLUTION:
The finite element discretization is shown in Figure 13–23. We will use four triangular 
elements of equal size for simplicity of the longhand solution. There will be convective 
heat loss only over the right side of the body because the other faces are insulated. We now 
calculate the element stiffness matrices using Eq. (13.5.11) applied for all elements and 
using Eq. (13.5.14) applied for element 4 only, because convection is occurring only across 
one edge of element 4.

SOLUTION:
We need consider only the left half of the body, because we have a vertical plane of sym-
metry passing through the body 2 m from both the left and right edges. This vertical plane 
can be considered to be an insulated boundary. The finite element model is shown in 
Figure 13–25.
We will now calculate the element stiffness matrices. Because the magnitudes of the 
coordinates and conductivities are the same as in Example 13.6, the element stiffness 
­matrices are the same as Eqs. (13.5.23), (13.5.26), (13.5.28), and (13.5.30). Remember

	13.6 	 Line or Point Sources
A common practical heat-transfer problem is that of a source of heat generation present within 
a very small volume or area of some larger medium. When such heat sources exist within small 
volumes or areas, they may be idealized as line or point sources. Practical examples that can be 
modeled as line sources include hot-water pipes embedded within a medium such as concrete 
or earth, and conducting electrical wires embedded within a material.
A line or point source can be considered by simply including a node at the location of 
the source when the discretized finite element model is created. The value of the line source 
can then be added to the row of the global force matrix corresponding to the global degree of 
freedom assigned to the node. However, another procedure can be used to treat the line source 
when it is more convenient to leave the source within an element.
We now consider the line source of magnitude Qp, with typical units of W/m, located at 
(
,
)
x
y
o
o  within the two-dimensional element shown in Figure 13–26. The heat source Q is no 
longer constant over the element volume.

13.7  Three-Dimensional Heat Transfer by the Finite Element Method 
639
	13.7 	 Three-Dimensional Heat Transfer  
by the Finite Element Method
When the heat transfer is in all three directions (indicated by qx, qy and qz in Figure 13–28), 
then we must model the system using three-dimensional elements to account for the heat 
transfer. The basic partial differential equation for three-dimensional heat transfer by conduc-
tion, including the volumetric heat source, Q, is given by Eq. (13.7.1). It is an extension of the 
one-dimensional heat flow Eq. (13.1.7). It is interpreted as follows: At any point in a body the 
net heat by conduction into a unit volume plus the volumetric heat source generated must equal 
the change of thermal energy stored within the volume.

(13.7.1)
Examples of heat transfer that often is three-dimensional are shown in Figure 13–29. Here we 
see in Figure 13–29(a) and (b) an electronic component soldered to a printed wiring board [11]. 
The model includes a silicon chip, silver-eutectic die, alumina carrier, solder joints, copper 
pads, and the printed wiring board. The model actually consisted of 965 8-noded brick elements 
with 1395 nodes and 216 thermal elements and was modeled in Autodesk [10]. One-quarter 
of the actual device was modeled. Figure 13–29(c)  shows a heat sink used to cool a personal 
computer microprocessor chip (a two-dimensional model might possibly be used with good 
results as well). Finally, Figure 13–29(d) shows an engine block, which is an irregularly shaped 
three-dimensional body requiring a three-dimensional heat transfer analysis.
The elements often included in commercial computer programs to analyze three-­
dimensional heat transfer are the same as those used in Chapter 11 for three-dimensional stress 
analysis. These include the four-noded tetrahedral (Figure 11–3), the eight-noded hexahedral 
(brick) (Figure 11–5), and the twenty-noded hexahedral (Figure 11–6), the difference being that 
we now have only one degree of freedom at each node, namely a temperature. The temperature 
functions in the x; y; and z directions can now be expressed by expanding Eq. (13.5.2) to the 
third dimension or by using shape functions given by Eq. (11.2.10) for a four-noded tetrahedral 
element or by Eqs. (11.3.3) for the eight-noded brick or the Eqs. (11.3.11) through (11.3.14) 
for the twenty-noded brick. The typical eight-noded brick element is shown in Figure 13–30 
with the nodal temperatures included.

13.8  One-Dimensional Heat Transfer with Mass Transport

	13.8 	 One-Dimensional Heat Transfer with Mass Transport
We now consider the derivation of the basic differential equation for one-dimensional heat 
flow where the flow is due to conduction, convection, and mass transport (or transfer) of 
the fluid. The purpose of this derivation including mass transport is to show how Galerkin’s 
residual method can be directly applied to a problem for which the variational method is not 
applicable. That is, the differential equation will have an odd-numbered derivative and hence 
does not have an associated functional of the form of Eq. (1.4.3).
The control volume used in the derivation is shown in Figure 13–31. Again, from 
Eq. (13.1.1) for conservation of energy, we obtain

Having obtained the differential equation for heat transfer with mass transport, Eq. (13.8.3), we 
now derive the finite element equations by applying Galerkin’s residual method, as outlined in 
Section 3.12, directly to the differential equation. We assume here that

(13.9.14)
We observe from Eq. (13.9.13) that the mass transport stiffness matrix [
]
km  is asymmetric and, 
hence, [k] is asymmetric. Also, if heat flux exists, it usually occurs across the free ends of a 
system. Therefore, 
1
qx  and 
2
qx  usually occur only at the free ends of a system modeled by this 
element. When the elements are assembled, the heat fluxes 
1
qx  and 
2
qx  are usually equal but 
opposite at the node common to two elements, unless there is an internal concentrated heat 
flux in the system. Furthermore, for insulated ends, the 
’
q s
xp  also go to zero.
To illustrate the use of the finite element equations developed in this section for heat 
transfer with mass transport, we will now solve the following problem.
Example 13.9
Air is flowing at a rate of 2.16 kg/h inside a round tube with a diameter of 20 mm and length of 
10 cm, as shown in Figure 13–32. The initial temperature of the air entering the tube is 
8
40 C. 
The wall of the tube has a uniform constant temperature of 
8
100 C. The specific heat of 
the air is 
? 8
1.005 kJ/(kg
C), the convection coefficient between the air and the inner wall 
of the tube is 
? 8
15 W/(m
C)
2
, and the thermal conductivity is 
? 8
0.03 W/(m
C). Determine the 
temperature of the air along the length of the tube and the heat flow at the inlet and outlet 
of the tube. Here the flow rate and specific heat are given in force units (Newtons) instead 
of mass units (kg). This is not a problem because the units cancel in the mc ­product in the 
formulation of the equations.

The finite element solution is then seen to compare quite favorably with the analytical 
solution.
The element with the stiffness matrix given by Eq. (13.9.13) has been used in Reference 
[8] to analyze heat exchangers. Both double-pipe and shell-and-tube heat exchangers were 
modeled to predict the length of tube needed to perform the task of proper heat exchange 
between two counterflowing fluids. Excellent agreement was found between the finite element 
solution and the analytical solutions described in Reference [9].
Finally, remember that when the variational formulation of a problem is difficult to obtain 
but the differential equation describing the problem is available, a residual method such as 
Galerkin’s method can be used to solve the problem.

Figure 13–33 is a flowchart of the finite element process used for the analysis of two- and 
three-dimensional heat-transfer problems.
Figures 13–34 and 13–35 show examples of two-dimensional temperature distribu-
tion using the two-dimensional heat-transfer element of this chapter (results obtained from 
Autodesk [10]).
Figure 13–34(a) shows a square plate subjected to boundary temperatures. Figure 13–34(b) 
shows the finite element model, along with the temperature distribution throughout the plate.

Figure 13–35(a) shows a square duct that carries hot gases such that its surface ­temperature 
is 
8
380 C. The duct is wrapped by a layer of circular fiberglass. The finite element model, along 
with the temperature distribution throughout the fiberglass is shown in Figure 13–35(b).
Figures 13–36 and 13–37 illustrate the use of the three-dimensional solid element described 
in Section 13.7 for determining temperature distribution and heat flux in solid bodies subjected 
to temperature change. Figure 13–36 is an anvil with the nose heated to 
8
250 C. The tempera-
ture distribution throughout the anvil is shown. Figure 13–37 is a solid model of a steel forging 
hammer with the flat end of the hammer subjected to a 
8
210 C surface temperature. Notice that 
the temperature plot indicates the end of the handle temperature is 
8
84.2 C.

We will observe that the form of the equations is the same as that for heat transfer described 
in Chapter 13.
We begin with a derivation of the basic differential equation in one dimension for an ideal 
fluid in a steady state, not rotating (that is, the fluid particles are translating only), incompress-
ible (constant mass density), and inviscid (having no viscosity). We then extend this deriva-
tion to the two-dimensional case. We also consider the units used for the physical quantities 
involved in fluid flow. For more advanced topics, such as viscous flow, compressible flow, and 
three-dimensional problems, consult Reference [1].
We will use the same procedure to develop the element equations as in the heat transfer 
problem; that is, we define an assumed fluid head for the flow through porous media (seepage) 
problem or velocity potential for flow of fluid through pipes and around solid bodies within 
each element. Then, to obtain the element equations, we use both a direct approach similar to 
that used in Chapters 2, 3, and 4 to develop the element equations and the minimization of a 
functional as used in Chapter 13. These equations result in matrices analogous to the stiffness 
and force matrices of the stress analysis problem or the conduction and associated force matri-
ces of the heat transfer problem.
Next, we consider both one- and two-dimensional finite element formulations of the 
­fluid-flow problem and provide examples of one-dimensional fluid flow through porous media 
and through pipes and of flow within a two-dimensional region. We present the results for a 
two-dimensional fluid-flow problem.
We then consider flow through hydraulic networks and electric networks and show the 
analogies between these networks and the spring assemblage.
Finally, we describe concepts for electrostatic analysis and develop the two-dimensional 
finite element formulation for electrostatic analysis, along with computer program examples.

Fluid Flow through a Porous Medium
Let us first consider the derivation of the basic differential equation for the one-dimensional 
problem of steady-state fluid flow through a porous medium. The purpose of this derivation 
is to present a physical insight into the fluid-flow phenomena, which must be understood so 
that the finite element formulation of the problem can be fully comprehended. (For additional 
information on fluid flow, consult References [2] and [3]). We begin by considering the control 
volume shown in Figure 14 –1. By conservation of mass, we have

Equation (14.1.3) states that the velocity in the x direction is proportional to the gradient

positive in the direction opposite the direction of fluid head increase, or that the fluid flows 
in the direction of lower fluid head. Equation (14.1.3) is analogous to Fourier’s law of heat 
conduction, Eq. (13.1.3).

14.1  Derivation of the Basic Differential Equations
677
Fluid Flow in Pipes and Around Solid Bodies
We now consider the steady-state irrotational flow of an incompressible and inviscid fluid. For 
the ideal fluid, the fluid particles do not rotate; they only translate, and the friction between the 
fluid and the surfaces is ignored. Also, the fluid does not penetrate into the surrounding body 
or separate from the surface of the body, which could create voids.
The equations for this fluid motion can be expressed in terms of the stream function or 
the velocity potential function. We will use the velocity potential analogous to the fluid head 
that was used for the derivation of the differential equation for flow through a porous medium 
in the preceding subsection.
The velocity v of the fluid is related to the velocity potential function f by

surface 1

to a surface 2

flowing through a pipe in the positive x direction, as shown in Figure 14 –4.

We conclude that the boundary flow velocity is positive if directed into the surface (region), as 
at the left edge, and is negative if directed away from the surface, as at the right edge.
At an impermeable boundary, the flow velocity and thus the derivative of the veloc-
ity potential normal to the boundary must be zero. At a boundary of uniform or constant 
velocity, any convenient magnitude of velocity potential f may be specified as the gradient 
of the potential function; see, for instance, Eq. (14.1.13). This idea is also illustrated by 
Example 14.3.
	14.2 	 One-Dimensional Finite Element Formulation
We can proceed directly to the one-dimensional finite element formulation of the fluid-flow 
problem by now realizing that the fluid-flow problem is analogous to the heat-conduction 
problem of Chapter 13. We merely substitute the fluid velocity potential function f for the 
temperature function T, the vector of nodal potentials denoted by { }
p  for the nodal temperature 
vector { }t , fluid velocity v for heat flux q, and permeability coefficient K for flow through a 
porous medium instead of the conduction coefficient K. If fluid flow through a pipe or around 
a solid body is considered, then K is taken as unity. The steps are as follows.

Step 4 Derive the Element Stiffness Matrix and Equations
The fluid-flow problem has a stiffness matrix that can be found using the first term on the right 
side of Eq. (13.4.17). That is, the fluid-flow stiffness matrix is analogous to the conduction part 
of the stiffness matrix in the heat transfer problem. There is no comparable convection matrix 
to be added to the stiffness matrix. However, we will choose to use a direct approach similar 
to that used initially to develop the stiffness matrix for the bar element in Chapter 3.
Consider the fluid element shown in Figure 14 –6 with length L and uniform cross-­
sectional area A. Recall that the stiffness matrix is defined in the structure problem to relate 
nodal forces to nodal displacements or in the temperature problem to relate nodal rates of 
heat flow to nodal temperatures. In the fluid-flow problem, we define the stiffness matrix 
to relate nodal volumetric fluid-flow rates to nodal potentials or fluid heads as

Equation (14.2.15) is analogous to Eq. (13.4.20) for the heat-conduction element or to 
Eq. (3.1.14) for the one-dimensional (axial stress) bar element. The permeability or stiffness 
matrix will have units of square meters.
In general, the basic element may be subjected to internal sources or sinks, such as from a 
pump, or to surface-edge flow rates, such as from a river or stream. To include these or similar 
effects, consider the element of Figure 14 – 6 now to include a uniform internal source Q acting 
over the whole element and a uniform surface flow rate source p
q  acting over the surface, as 
shown in Figure 14 –7. The force matrix terms are

The assemblage procedure is similar to the direct stiffness approach, but it is now based on 
the requirement that the potentials at a common node between two elements be equal. The 
boundary conditions on nodal potentials are given by Eq. (14.1.15).
Step 6  Solve for the Nodal Potentials
We now solve for the global nodal potentials, { }
p , where the appropriate nodal potential bound-
ary conditions, Eq. (14.1.15), are specified.
Step 7  Solve for the Element Velocities and Volumetric Flow Rates

Because 1

directly. The problem is similar to that occurring if we try to solve the structural problem 
without prescribing displacements sufficient to prevent rigid body motion of the structure. 
This was discussed in Chapter 2. Because the p’s correspond to displacements in the struc-
tural problem, it appears that we must specify at least one value of p in order to obtain a 
solution. We then proceed as follows. Select a convenient value for 
3
p  (for instance set

These are not absolute values for

p  and

p ; rather, they are relative to 
3
p . The fluid veloc-
ities in each element are absolute values, because velocities depend on the differences in 
p’s. These differences are the same no matter what value for 3
p  was chosen. You can verify 
this by choosing

Fluid Flow through Hydraulic Networks
Hydraulic or piping networks typically found in buildings, industrial plants, farm irrigation 
pipe networks, municipal water systems, and power plants also can be analyzed using the 
finite element method. Pressure flow in these networks can be described by a system of linear 
equations. In these networks, such as the one shown in Figure 14 –13, the fluid flow source 
(volumetric flow rate) Q (in units of  m /s
3
) forces fluid through the pipe network. As the fluid 
flows through each branch, there is resistance in each branch which is typically a function 
of the fluid viscosity m (in units of N-s/m2) (a typical value of m is 
3

N-s/m

water at

20 C), the length of the pipe branch, the diameter of the pipe, the average velocity 
of the fluid flow in the branch, and the friction factor. These factors cause a pressure drop 
through the pipe branch. We assume the fluid to be laminar, incompressible, and in a steady 
state and the pressure drop Dp (in units of  N/m2) in a branch of the network to be pro-
portional to the volumetric flow rate q (in units of m /s
3
) through that branch, such that by

and q.
Here we consider the basic element as a branch of the network analogous to a spring 
element, as shown in Figure 14 –14.
Using Eq. (14.2.39), we relate the volumetric flow rates to the pressures at each node by 
the matrix equation as follows:

Equation (14.2.40) is considered the element equilibrium relations between the nodal pressures 
and volumetric flow rates. The stiffness matrix for the pipe resistance is now defined as the 
matrix relating the nodal volumetric flow rates to the nodal pressures. From Eq. (14.2.40), the 
element stiffness matrix is

We can draw analogies between the pipe resistor element and the spring element from ­Chapter 2 
as follows: The nodal pressures are analogous to nodal displacements, the nodal volumetric 
flow rates are analogous to nodal forces, and the resistance R is analogous to the inverse of 
the spring constant k.
We will now use Eq. (14.2.39) for each branch of Figure 14 –13 along with the continu-
ity of flow that states that the mass of fluid passing all sections in a stream of fluid per unit 
time must be the same. For networks of a single fluid property with constant density, this is 
equivalent to

Finally, we should understand that the assumptions presented in this section do not always 
apply to real pipe network systems. It should be noted that complex pipe networks often are 
composed of piping with network fittings such as elbows, tees, contractors, expansions, valves, 
and pumps. Also, the flow may not always be laminar and steady state. Numerous programs 
(such as described in References [6, 7, 8]) have been developed to deal with these additional 
design problems.

Because many fluid-flow problems can be modeled as two-dimensional problems, we now 
develop the equations for an element appropriate for these problems. Examples using this 
element then follow.

The three-node triangular element in Figure 14 –15 is the basic element for the solution of the

The finite element model is shown in Figure 14 –16. We use only the four triangular 
elements of equal size for simplicity of the longhand solution. For increased accuracy in 
results, we would need to refine the mesh. This body has the same magnitude of coordinates 
as ­Figure 13–25. Therefore, the total stiffness matrix is given by Eq. (13.5.40) as

A line or point fluid source from a pump, for instance, can be handled in the same manner 
as described in Section 13.6 for heat sources. If the source is at a node when the discretized 
finite element model is created, then the source can be added to the row of the global force 
matrix corresponding to the global degree of freedom assigned to the node. If the source is 
within an element, we can use Section 13.6 to allocate the source to the proper nodes, as illus-
trated by the following example.

	14.4 	 Flowchart and Example of a Fluid-Flow Program
Figure 14 –18 is a flowchart of a finite element process used for the analysis of two-dimensional 
steady-state fluid flow through a porous medium or through a pipe. Recall that flow through a 
porous medium is analogous to heat transfer by conduction. For more complicated fluid flows, 
see Reference [6].
We now present computer program results for a two-dimensional steady-state, incompress-
ible fluid flow. The program is based on the flowchart of Figure 14 –18.
For flow through a porous medium, we recall the analogies between conductive heat 
transfer and flow through a porous medium and use the heat transfer processor from Reference 
[4] to solve the problem shown in Figure 14 –19. The fluid flow problem shown discretized in

Figure 14 –19 has the top and bottom sides impervious, whereas the right side has a constant 
head of 3 cm and the left side has a constant head of 4 cm.
Results for the nodal potentials obtained using [4] are shown in Table 14 –2. They compare 
exactly with solutions obtained using another computer program (see Reference [5]).
	14.5 	 Electrical Networks
Current flow in electrical networks or circuits can be described by a system of linear equations 
developed using the direct stiffness method. In an electrical network such as the one shown in 
Figure 14 –20, a voltage source (such as from a battery) forces a current of electrons to flow 
through the network. When the current passes through a resistor (such as a lightbulb or motor), 
some of the voltage is absorbed by the resistor. By Ohm’s law, the voltage drop DV across the 
resistor is given by
	
D

V
RI	
(14.5.1)
where the voltage V is measured in units of volts, the resistance R is measured in ohms (the 
Greek omega symbol Ω or R is used to designate ohms), and the current flow I is measured in 
units of amperes or amps.

Here we consider the basic element as the resistor element analogous to a spring element 
shown in Figure 14 –21.
Using Ohm’s law, Eq. (14.5.1), we relate the voltage difference across the resistor to the 
current flow through each end of the resistor by the matrix equation as

Equation (14.5.2) represents the element equilibrium relations between the nodal currents and 
nodal voltages.
The stiffness matrix for the resistor is now defined as the matrix relating the nodal voltages 
to the nodal currents. From Eq. (14.5.2), the stiffness matrix is then

We can draw analogies between the resistor element and the spring element from Chapter 2 
as follows: The nodal currents are analogous to nodal displacements, the nodal voltages are 
analogous to nodal forces, and the resistance R is analogous to the spring constant k.
We now describe some sign conventions associated with the solution of the network in 
Figure 14 –20. The network contains three closed loops. We designate these loops one (left 
loop), two (center loop), and three (right loop) and by standard circuit analysis indicate the 
currents flowing in each loop with current 1I , 2I , and 3I , respectively, shown by the curved 
arrows inside each loop. The designated directions of the loop currents are arbitrary, but we 
will use counterclockwise notation as positive in this description. Upon solving the equations 
for the currents, if a current is negative, then the actual direction of current flow is opposite to

that chosen or clockwise. We must be careful regarding the positive direction of the voltages 
provided by the battery. If the current-direction curved arrowhead shown points from the neg-
ative side (shorter side) within the battery to the positive (longer side), the voltage is taken as 
positive; otherwise the voltage is negative. For example, 1
V  is positive as 1I  goes around in a 
counterclockwise manner into the short side of battery 1
V .
Current flow in a loop is described by Kirchhoff’s law as follows: The algebraic sum of 
the product of resistance times current (RI) voltage drops in one direction around a loop equals 
the algebraic sum of the voltage sources (from batteries for instance) in the same direction 
around the loop.
We will now use both Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws, along with afore-described sign con-
ventions to set up the three loop equations used to solve for the currents in each loop in 
­Figure 14 –20. That is, from Figure 14 –20 for the three loops, we have

We should note that in assembling the equations, the stiffness matrices account for the 
currents going through each resistor. For instance, by Kirchhoff’s law, element 1 only has 
current 1I  from loop 1 current passing through it, while element 2 has positive current 1I  
going through it from the counterclockwise direction around loop 1 (upward current), and 
negative current 2I  going through it from the counterclockwise flow around loop 2 heading 
down through element 2, as shown in Figure 14 –22. Also, the voltage in loop 1 is 115 V 
by convention, as the current through loop 1 passes down through the negative (short) side 
of the battery to the positive (long) side, as shown in Figure 14 –22. Similarly, the voltage 
in loop 2 is considered positive in Eq. (14.5.9), as the current 2I  passes through the negative 
side of the battery to the positive side. Finally, the voltage in loop 3 is from both the 10 V 
and 5 V batteries. As the current in loop 3 goes from the positive side of the 10 V battery 
to the negative side, the voltage is considered 210 V through this battery. Similarly, the

Notice also that by convention we have chosen all loop currents to be positive in the

negative.

The negative sign on 3I  indicates that 3I  is really in a clockwise direction in Figure 14 –22.
The branch current also can be obtained after determining the currents in each loop. 
If only one loop current passes through a branch, such as from A to B in Figure 14 –22, 
the branch current 2I  equals the loop current. If more than one loop current passes through 
a branch, such as A to D or B to C, the branch current is the algebraic sum of the loop 
currents in the branch (based on Kirchoff’s law). For example, the current in branch AD

Electric fields are often illustrated by plots of field lines as shown in Figure 14 –24. These 
will also be shown by the computer program model results given by Examples 14.9 and 10.
We will subsequently derive the finite element equations for two-dimensional electrostatic 
problems. The basis for the finite element equations is the Poisson equation which is derived 
from Gauss’s law. Therefore, we now derive Gauss’s law in differential form.
Gauss’s Law
Gauss’s law relates the relationship between the distribution of electric charge in space, called 
the charge density r (in coulombs per cubic meter units (C/m )
3 ) and the resulting electric field.

If the electric field from a point charge is spherically symmetric, coulomb’s law can be derived 
from Gauss’s law.
Consider the three-dimensional differential elemental volume shown in Figure 14 –25 
with a charge density r acting over it where we define charge density as the sum of charge in 
a differential element divided by the element volume given by

By Gauss’s law, the total flux of electric field lines out of the surface in free space is equal 
to the total charge enclosed within the differential volume divided by «0. If there is no enclosed 
charge r 5
(

First consider the two faces normal to the x axis, as shown in Figure 14 –25, with areas Dy

Dielectric materials are used in transmission lines. In a coaxial cable, polyethylene is 
often used between the center conductor and outside shield. The relative static permittivity of a 
solvent is a relative measure of its polarity. For example, water, which is a very polar material, 
has a dielectric constant of 80 at

20 C as listed above, and hexane used as a spot remover has 
dielectric constant of 2.

The steps defined in Chapter 6 will be followed to derive the stiffness matrix and equations 
for solving the electrostatics problem.
Step 1 Select Element Type
In the finite element method of solution, the basic triangle as described in Section 6.2 for 
stress analysis or Section 13.5 for heat transfer is the basis for two-dimensional finite element 
solutions, although the rectangular element (Section 6.6) and general quadrilateral element 
(Section 10.2) also can be used. For simplicity’s sake, we consider the so-called first order 
triangle with corner nodes only as shown in Figure 14 –26. The potentials vi, v j, and vm at 
nodes i, j, and m are analogous to the nodal temperatures of the heat transfer problem described 
in Chapter 13.
Step 2 Select a Potential Function
The potential function is described by the bilinear equation

The boundary conditions are of two types.
1.	
Dirichlet or imposed potentials on surface 1
S . These are enforced by applying a known 
voltage at one or more nodes (analogous to applying a known displacement in the stress 
analysis problem), such as imposing a potential or voltage at node 1 (say v
1V
1 5
) as 
shown in Figure 14 –27.
2.	
Neumann or derivative of voltage or potential is known on surface 
2
S . In this case, the 
electric field intensity, E
grad V
5 2
 must be tangential to the surface 
2
S  as shown in 
­Figure 14 –28. (These boundary conditions do not need to be specified in the finite element 
applications.)

Step 6 Solve for the Nodal Potentials or Voltages
We determine the unknown global potentials or voltages by solving the system of algebraic 
equations given by Eq. (14.6.40) with the boundary conditions invoked.
Step 7 Solve for the Electric Fields and Electric Displacement Fields
We determine the electric fields and electric displacement fields at each node or at element 
centroids using Eq. (14.6.26) and (14.6.28), respectively.
We now present a simple hand solution of an electrostatics problem.
Example 14.8
For the two-element model shown in Figure 14 –29, determine the nodal voltages at the right 
end. Node 1 has an applied voltage set to 10 V and node 2 is set to 0 V. The plate is one unit 
thick t(
1m)
5
 and the permittivity is « 5 5. There is no charge density.

We now present two computer model solutions of electrostatics problems.

■Figure 14 –30  Voltage variation throughout channel (See the full-color insert for a color 
version of this figure.)
Example 14.9
An infinitely long enclosed rectangular channel 1 m by 0.4 m is filled with air. The top is 
insulated from the sides and connected to a potential of 50 V. The sides and bottom are 
grounded (0 V). Assume the dielectric constant of air to be 1. Determine the voltage varia-
tion and the electric field through the channel.

713
SOLUTION:
The finite element model of the channel is shown in Figure 14 –30 with the voltage 
variation throughout the channel. Figure 14 –31 shows the electric field variation in the 
y direction.
Example 14.10
A busbar is a rectangular conductor used in the distribution of electric power in a distri-
bution box at 110 V. The sides of the busbar give off 110 V. In the system shown in Figure 
14 –32, the bottom side is assumed ground at 0 V. Assume the medium around the busbar 
is air (
1)
« 5
. Also assume symmetry in geometry and potential with respect to a vertical 
line along the left side of the model. Therefore, the model is really one-half of the whole 
system. Determine the voltage distribution and maximum electric field intensity. Use a 
two-dimensional finite element model. Let the thickness be 0.1 m.

Summary Equations
SOLUTION:
The results in Figures 14 –32 and 14 –33 show the voltage distribution through the air 
around the busbar and the electric field intensity magnitude distribution. As the voltage 
has not died out to near zero along the right side of the model, more air should be used 
in the model. The maximum electric field intensity magnitude is 2689 V/m near the right 
edge of the busbar.

Thermal Stress
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Formulate the thermal stress problem.
■ Derive the thermal force matrix for a one-dimensional bar.
■ Derive the thermal force matrix for the three-noded triangle for both plane stress 
and plane strain.
■ Solve examples of bars, trusses, and plane stress problems for thermal stresses due 
to temperature change.
■ Show a finite element computer result for the thermal stress solution of a plate sub-
ject to temperature change.
■ Demonstrate a finite element computer result for the thermal stress solution of a 
three-dimensional object subjected to temperature change.
Introduction
In this chapter, we consider the problem of thermal stresses within a body. First, we will discuss 
the strain energy due to thermal stresses (stresses resulting from the constrained motion of a 
body or part of a body during a temperature change in the body).
The minimization of the thermal strain energy equation is shown to result in the thermal 
force matrix. We will then develop this thermal force matrix for the one-dimensional bar ele-
ment and the two-dimensional plane stress and plane strain elements.
We will outline the procedures for solving both one- and two-dimensional problems and 
then provide solutions of specific problems, including illustration of a computer program used 
to solve thermal stress problems for two- and three-dimensional stress problems.
	15.1 	 Formulation of the Thermal Stress  
Problem and Examples
In addition to the strains associated with the displacement functions due to mechanical loading, 
there may be other strains within a body due to temperature variations, swelling (moisture 
­differential), or other causes. We will concern ourselves only with the strains due to temperature 
variation, T
« , and will consider both one- and two-dimensional problems.

Temperature changes in a structure can result in large stresses if not considered properly 
in design. In bridges, improper constraint of beams and slabs can result in large compressive 
stresses and resulting buckling failures due to temperature changes. In statically indeterminate 
trusses, members subjected to large temperature changes can result in stresses induced in mem-
bers of the truss. Similarly, machine parts constrained from expanding or contracting may have 
large stresses induced in them due to temperature changes. Composite members made of two 
or more different materials may experience large stresses due to temperature change if they are 
not thermally compatible; that is, if the materials have large differences in their coefficients of 
thermal expansion, stresses may be induced even under free expansion (Figure 15 –1).
When a member undergoes a temperature change the member attempts to change 
­dimensions. For an unconstrained member AB (Figure 15 –2) undergoing uniform change in 
temperature T, the change in the length L is given by
	
d
a
5
TL
T
	
(15.1.1)
where a is called the coefficient of thermal expansion and T is the change in temperature. The 
coefficient a is a mechanical property of the material having units of 1
C
⁄ 8  (where 8C is degrees 
Celsius). In Eq. (15.1.1), d T is considered to be positive when expansion occurs and negative 
when contraction occurs. Typical values of a are: for structural steel

Based on the definition of normal strain, we can determine the strain due to a uniform 
temperature change. For the bar subjected to a uniform temperature change T (Figure 15 –2),

(15.1.2)
Since the bar in Figure 15 –2 is free to expand, that is, it is not constrained by other members or 
supports, the bar will not have any stress in it. In general, for statically determinate structures, 
a uniform temperature change in one or more members does not result in stress in any of the 
members. That is, the structure will be stress free. For statically indeterminate structures, a 
uniform temperature change in one or more members of the structure usually results in stress 
T
s  in one or more members. We can have strain due to temperature change T
«  without stress 
due to temperature change, and we can have 
T
s  without any actual change in member lengths 
or without strains.
We will now consider the one-dimensional thermal stress problem. The linear stress/strain

15.1  Formulation of the Thermal Stress Problem and Examples 
733
The thermal force matrix for the three-noded triangular element is obtained by substituting the 
[B] from Eq. (9.1.19) and Eq. (9.1.21) into the following:

(15.1.28)
where B
[ ] is given by Eq. (9.2.3), A is the surface area of the element which can be found in 
general from Eq. (6.2.8) when the coordinates of the element are known, and [D] is given by 
Eq. (9.2.6).
We will now describe the solution procedure for both one- and two-dimensional thermal 
stress problems.
Step 1
Evaluate the thermal force matrix, such as Eq. (15.1.20) or Eq. (15.1.25). Then treat this 
force matrix as an equivalent (or initial) force matrix F
{
}
0  analogous to that obtained when we 
replace a distributed load acting on an element by equivalent nodal forces (Chapters 4 and 5 
and Appendix D).
Step 2
Apply F

 for the nodal displacements. Recall that when we formulate the set of simulta-
neous equations, {F} represents the applied nodal forces, which here are assumed to be zero.
Step 3
Back-substitute the now known {d} into step 2 to obtain the actual nodal forces, 
F
K
d
F

Hence, the thermal stress problem is solved in a manner similar to the distributed load 
problem discussed for beams and frames in Chapters 4 and 5. We will now solve the following 
examples to illustrate the general procedure.

For the one-dimensional bar fixed at both ends and subjected to a uniform temperature rise

Stresses in elements 3 and 4 can be determined similarly. The clamped plate subjected 
to uniform heating (see the longhand solution, Example 15.5) was also solved using the 
Autodesk computer program from Reference [1]. The plate was discretized using the 
“automesh” feature of [1]. These results are similar to those obtained from the longhand 
solution of Example 15.5 using the very coarse mesh. The computer program solution with 
342 elements is naturally more accurate than the longhand solution with only four elements. 
Figure 15 –12 shows the discretized plate with resulting displacement superimposed on the 
maximum principal stress plot.

100 C acting over the entire inside 
surface of the hole. The resulting von Mises stress plot is shown with the maximum value of 
329.9 MPa occurring inside the hole.

Structural Dynamics and 
Time-Dependent Heat 
Transfer
Chapter Objectives
At the conclusion of this chapter, you will be able to:
■ Discuss the dynamics of a single-degree-of-freedom spring-mass system.
■ Derive the finite element equations for the time-dependent stress analysis of the 
one-dimensional bar, including derivation of the lumped-and consistent-mass 
matrices.
■ Introduce procedures for numerical integration in time, including the central differ-
ence method, Newmark’s method, and Wilson’s method.
■ Describe how to determine the natural frequencies of bars by the finite element 
method.
■ Illustrate the finite element solution of a time-dependent bar problem.
■ Develop the beam element lumped-and consistent-mass matrices.
■ Illustrate the determination of natural frequencies for beams by the finite element 
method.
■ Develop the mass matrices for truss, plane frame, plane stress, plane strain, 
axisymmetric, and solid elements.
■ Derive the time-dependent heat transfer equations, including the consistent-and 
lumped-mass matrices in one dimension.
■ Describe numerical time integration methods which originate from the generalized 
trapezoid rule. These include the forward difference, Crank-Nicolson, Galerkin, and 
backward difference methods.
■ Report some results of structural dynamics problems solved using a computer 
program, including a fixed-fixed beam for natural frequencies, a bar, a fixed-fixed 
beam, a rigid frame, and a gantry crane—all subjected to time-dependent forcing 
functions.

include discussion of the stress analysis of the one-dimensional bar, beam, truss, and plane 
frame. This is followed by the analysis of one-dimensional heat transfer.
We will provide the basic equations necessary for structural dynamics analysis and 
develop both the lumped- and the consistent-mass matrices involved in the analyses of the 
bar, beam, truss, and plane frame. We will describe the assembly of the global mass matrix 
for truss and plane frame analysis and then present numerical integration methods for han-
dling the time derivative. We also present the mass matrices for the constant strain triangle 
and quadrilateral plane elements, for the axisymmetric element, and for the tetrahedral solid 
element.
We will provide longhand solutions for the determination of the natural frequencies for 
bars and beams and then illustrate the time-step integration process involved with the stress 
analysis of a bar subjected to a time-dependent forcing function.
We will next derive the basic equations for the time-dependent one-dimensional 
heat-transfer problem and discuss their applications. This chapter provides the basic con-
cepts necessary for the solution of time-dependent problems. We conclude with a section on 
some computer program results for structural dynamics and time-dependent heat-transfer 
problems.
	16.1 	 Dynamics of a Spring-Mass System
In this section, we discuss the motion of a single-degree-of-freedom spring-mass system to 
introduce the important concepts necessary for the later study of continuous systems such as 
bars, beams, and plane frames. In Figure 16 –1, we show the single-degree-of-freedom spring-
mass system subjected to a time-dependent force F(t). Here k represents the spring stiffness or 
constant, and m represents the mass of the system.
The free-body diagram of the mass is shown in Figure 16 –2. The spring force 
5
T
kx 
and the applied force F(t) act on the mass, and the mass-times-acceleration term is shown 
separately.
Applying Newton’s second law of motion, 
5

mmaa, to the mass, we obtain the equation 
of motion in the x direction as

(16.1.2)
Equation (16.1.2) is a linear differential equation of the second order whose standard solution 
for the displacement x consists of a homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Standard 
analytical solutions for this forced vibration can be found in texts on dynamics or vibrations 
such as Reference [1]. The analytical solution will not be presented here as our intent is to 
introduce basic concepts in vibration behavior. However, we will solve the problem defined 
by Eq. (16.1.2) by an approximate numerical technique in Section 16.3 (see Examples 16.1 
and 16.2).
The homogeneous solution to Eq. (16.1.2) is the solution obtained when the right side is 
set equal to zero. A number of useful concepts regarding vibrations are obtained by considering 
this free vibration of the mass—that is, when

(16.1.4)
where ω is called the natural circular frequency of the free vibration of the mass, expressed 
in units of radians per second or revolutions per minute (rpm). Hence, the natural circular 
frequency defines the number of cycles per unit time of the mass vibration. We observe from 
Eq. (16.1.3) that ω depends only on the spring stiffness k and the mass m of the body.
The motion defined by Eq. (16.1.4) is called simple harmonic motion. The displacement 
and acceleration are seen to be proportional but of opposite direction. Again, a standard solu-
tion to Eq. (16.1.4) can be found in Reference [1]. A typical displacement/time curve is repre-
sented by the sine curve shown in Figure 16 –3, where xm denotes the maximum displacement 
(called the amplitude of the vibration). The time interval required for the mass to complete 
one full cycle of motion is called the period of the vibration τ and is given by

Finally, note that all vibrations are damped to some degree by friction forces. These forces 
may be caused by dry or Coulomb friction between rigid bodies, by internal friction between 
molecules within a deformable body, or by fluid friction when a body moves in a fluid. Damp-
ing results in natural circular frequencies that are smaller than those for undamped systems; 
maximum displacements also are smaller when damping occurs. A basic treatment of damping 
can be found in Reference [1], and additional discussion is included in Section 16.9.
	16.2 	 Direct Derivation of the Bar Element Equations
We will now derive the finite element equations for the time-dependent (dynamic) stress anal-
ysis of the one-dimensional bar. Recall that the time-independent (static) stress analysis of the 
bar was considered in Chapter 3. The steps used in deriving the dynamic equations are the same 
as those used for the derivation of the static equations.
Step 1 Select Element Type
Figure 16 –4 shows the typical bar element of length L, cross-sectional area A, and mass den-
sity ρ (with typical units of kg/m3), with nodes 1 and 2 subjected to external time-dependent 
loads

Observe that the lumped-mass matrix has diagonal terms only. This facilitates the com-
putation of the global equations. However, solution accuracy is usually not as good as when a 
consistent-mass matrix is used [2].
We will now develop the consistent-mass matrix for the bar element. Numerous meth-
ods are available to obtain the consistent-mass matrix. The generally applicable virtual work 
principle (which is the basis of many energy principles, such as the principle of minimum 
potential energy for elastic bodies previously used in this text) provides a relatively simple 
method for derivation of the element equations and is included in Appendix E. However, an 
even simpler approach is to use D’Alembert’s principle; thus, we introduce an effective body

16.2  Direct Derivation of the Bar Element Equations
767
This mass matrix is called the consistent-mass matrix because it is derived from the same 
shape functions [N] that are used to obtain the stiffness matrix [k]. In general, [m] given by 
Eq. (16.2.19) will be a full but symmetric matrix. Equation (16.2.19) is a general form of the 
consistent-mass matrix; that is, substituting the appropriate shape functions, we can generate 
the mass matrix for such elements as the bar, beam, and plane stress.
We will now develop the consistent-mass matrix for the bar element of Figure 16 –4 by 
substituting the shape function Eqs. (16.2.3) into Eq. (16.2.19) as follows:

are the global stiffness, mass, and force matrices, respectively. Note that the global mass matrix 
is assembled in the same manner as the global stiffness matrix. Equation (16.2.24) represents a 
set of matrix equations discretized with respect to space. To obtain the solution of the equations, 
discretization in time is also necessary. We will describe this process in Section 16.3 and will 
later present representative solutions illustrating these equations.
	16.3 	 Numerical Integration in Time
We now introduce procedures for the discretization of Eq. (16.2.24) with respect to time. These 
procedures will enable us to determine the nodal displacements at different time increments 
for a given dynamic system. The general method used is called direct integration. There are 
two classifications of direct integration: explicit and implicit. We will formulate the equations 
for three direct integration methods. The first, and simplest, is an explicit method known as 
the central difference method [3, 4]. The second and third, more complicated but more versa-
tile than the central difference method, are implicit methods known as the Newmark-Beta (or 
Newmark’s) method [5] and the Wilson-Theta (or Wilson’s) method [7, 8]. The versatility of 
both Newmark’s and Wilson’s methods is evidenced by their adaptation in many commercially 
available computer programs. Wilson’s method is used in the Autodesk computer program [16]. 
Numerous other integration methods are available in the literature. Among these are Houboldt’s 
method [8] and the alpha method [13].
Central Difference Method
The central difference method is based on finite difference expressions in time for velocity and 
acceleration at time t given by

. The procedure used in deriving Eq. (16.3.1) is illustrated by use of the 
displacement /time curve shown in Figure 16 –5. Graphically, Eq. (16.3.1) represents the slope 
of the line shown in Figure 16 –5; that is, given two points at increments i 2 1 and i 1 1 on 
the curve, two Dt increments apart, an approximation of the first derivative at the midpoint i of 
the increment is given by Eq. (16.3.1). Similarly, using a velocity/time curve, we could obtain 
Eq. (16.3.1), or we can see that Eq. (16.3.2) is obtained simply by differentiating  Eq. (16.3.1) 
with respect to time.
It has been shown using, for instance, Taylor series expansions [3] that the acceleration 
can also be expressed in terms of the displacements by

Example 16.1
Determine the displacement, velocity, and acceleration at 0.05-s time intervals up to 0.02 s 
for the one-dimensional spring-mass oscillator subjected to the time-dependent forcing 
function shown in Figure 16 –7. [Guidelines regarding appropriate time intervals (or time 
steps) are given in Section 16.5.] This forcing function is a typical one assumed for blast 
loads. The restoring spring force versus displacement curve is also provided. [Note that 
­Figure 16 –7 also represents a one-element bar with its left end fixed and right node sub-
jected to F(t) when a lumped mass is used.]

SOLUTION:
Because we are considering the single degree of freedom associated with the mass, the 
general matrix equations describing the motion reduce to single scalar equations. We will 
represent this single degree of freedom by d.
The solution procedure follows the steps outlined in this section and in the flowchart

Newmark’s Method
We will now outline Newmark’s numerical method, which, because of its general versatility, 
has been adopted into numerous commercially available computer programs for purposes of 
structural dynamics analysis. (Complete development of the equations can be found in Refer-

where b and g are parameters chosen by the user. The parameter b is generally chosen 
between 0 and 1
4, and g is often taken to be 1
2. For instance, choosing g 5 1
2 and b 5 0, it 
can be shown that Eqs. (16.3.9) and (16.3.10) reduce to the central difference Eqs. (16.3.1) 
and (16.3.2). If g 5 1
2 and b 5 1
6 are chosen, Eqs. (16.3.9) and (16.3.10) correspond to 
those for which a linear acceleration assumption is valid within each time interval. For 
g 5 1
2 and b 5 1
4 , it has been shown that the numerical analysis is stable; that is, computed 
quantities such as displacement and velocities do not become unbounded regardless of the 
time step chosen. Furthermore, it has been found [5] that a time step of approximately 1
10 
of the shortest natural frequency of the structure being analyzed usually yields the best 
results.

Figure 16 –8 is a flowchart of the solution procedure using Newmark’s equations. The advan-
tages of Newmark’s method over the central difference method are that Newmark’s method can 
be made unconditionally stable (for instance, if b 5 1
4  and g 5 1
2) and that larger time steps 
can be used with better results because, in general, the difference expressions more closely 
approximate the true acceleration and displacement time behavior [8] to [11]. Other difference 
formulas, such as Wilson’s and Houboldt’s, also yield unconditionally stable algorithms.
We will now illustrate the use of Newmark’s equations as they apply to the following 
example problem.

Example 16.2
Determine the displacement, velocity, and acceleration at 0.1-s time increments up to a time 
of 0.5 s for the one-dimensional spring-mass oscillator subjected to the time-­dependent 
­forcing function shown in Figure 16 –9, along with the restoring spring force versus 
­displacement curve. Assume the oscillator is initially at rest. Let b 5 1
6 and g 5 1
2, which 
corresponds to an assumption of linear acceleration within each time step.
SOLUTION:
Because we are again considering the single degree of freedom associated with the mass, 
the general matrix equations describing the motion reduce to single scalar equations. Again, 
we represent this single degree of freedom by d.
The solution procedure follows the steps outlined in this section and in the flowchart 
of Figure 16 –8.

Wilson’s Method
We will now outline Wilson’s method (also called the Wilson-Theta method). Because of its 
general versatility, it has been adopted into the Autodesk computer program for purposes of 
structural dynamics analysis. Wilson’s method is an extension of the linear acceleration method 
wherein the acceleration is assumed to vary linearly within each time interval now taken from t 
to t
t
1 QD , where Q $ 1.0. For Q 5 1.0, the method reduces to the linear acceleration scheme. 
However, for unconditional stability in the numerical analysis, we must use Q $ 1.37 [7, 8]. 
In practice, Q 5 1.40 is often selected. The Wilson equations are given in a form similar to the

You will note the similarities between Wilson’s Eqs. (16.3.22) and Newmark’s Eqs. (16.3.14).

Also, Wilson’s method (like Newmark’s) is an implicit integration method, because the

The solution procedure using Wilson’s equations is as follows:

A flowchart similar to Figure 16 –8, based on Newmark’s equation, is left to your discretion. 
Again, note that the advantage of Wilson’s method is that it can be made unconditionally stable 
by setting Q $ 1.37. Finally, the time step, t

10 to 1
20 of the 
shortest natural period n
τ  of the finite element assemblage with n degrees of freedom; that is, 

D 5 τ

n /10. In comparing the Newmark and Wilson methods, we observe little difference in 
the computational effort, because they both require about the same time step. Wilson’s method 
is very similar to Newmark’s, so hand solutions will not be presented. However, we suggest 
that you rework Example 16.1 by Wilson’s method and compare your displacement results 
with the exact solution listed in Table 16 –1.
	16.4 	 Natural Frequencies of a One-Dimensional Bar
Before solving the structural stress dynamics analysis problem, we will first describe how to 
determine the natural frequencies of continuous elements (specifically the bar element). The 
natural frequencies are necessary in a vibration analysis and also are important when choosing 
a proper time step for a structural dynamics analysis (as will be discussed in Section 16.5).
Natural frequencies are determined by solving Eq. (16.2.24) in the absence of a forcing 
function F(t). Therefore, we solve the matrix equation

lowing example problem.
Example 16.3
For the bar shown in Figure 16 –10 with length 2L, modulus of elasticity E, mass density ρ, 
and cross-sectional area A, determine the first two natural frequencies.
SOLUTION:
For simplicity, the bar is discretized into two elements each of length L as shown in 
­Figure 16 –11. To solve Eq. (16.4.7), we must develop the total stiffness matrix for the bar by 
using Eq. (16.2.11). Either the lumped-mass matrix Eq. (16.2.12) or the consistent-mass matrix

Eq. (16.2.23) can be used. In general, using the consistent-mass matrix has resulted in solutions 
that compare more closely to available analytical and experimental results than those found 
using the lumped-mass matrix. However, the longhand calculations are more tedious using the 
consistent-mass matrix than using the lumped-mass matrix because the consistent-mass matrix 
is a full symmetric matrix, whereas the lumped-mass matrix has nonzero terms only along the 
main diagonal. Hence, the lumped-mass matrix will be used in this analysis.

However, the consistent-mass approach can be mathematically proved to yield an upper 
bound on the frequencies, whereas the lumped-mass approach yields results that can be

are two natural modes and two frequencies. When a system vibrates with a given natural 
frequency

v , that unique shape with arbitrary amplitude corresponding to v i is called the 
mode. In general, for an n-degrees-of-freedom discrete system, there are n natural modes 
and frequencies. A continuous system actually has an infinite number of natural modes and 
frequencies. When the system is discretized, only n degrees of freedom are created. The 
lowest modes and frequencies are approximated most often; the higher frequencies are

16.5  Time-Dependent One-Dimensional Bar Analysis
785
SOLUTION:
Because the bar is discretized into two elements of equal length, the global stiffness and 
mass matrices determined in Section 16.4 and given by Eqs. (16.4.9) and (16.4.11) are 
applicable. We will again use the lumped-mass matrix because of its resulting computational 
simplicity. Figure 16 –14 shows the discretized bar and the associated lumped masses.
For illustration of the numerical time integration scheme, we will use the central dif-
ference method because it is easier to apply for longhand computations (and without loss 
of generality).
We next select the time step to be used in the integration process. It has been mathe-
matically shown that the time step must be less than or equal to 2 divided by the highest 
natural frequency when the central difference method is used [7]; that is, t
v
D # 2 /
max. 
However, for practical results, we must use a time step of less than or equal to three-fourths 
of this value; that is,
	




v
D #
t

(16.5.1)
This time step ensures stability of the integration method. This criterion for selecting a 
time step demonstrates the usefulness of determining the natural frequencies of vibration, 
as previously described in Section 16.4, before performing the dynamic stress analysis. An 
alternative guide (used only for a bar) for choosing the approximate time step is

	16.6 	 Beam Element Mass Matrices and Natural 
Frequencies
We now consider the lumped- and consistent-mass matrices appropriate for time-dependent 
beam analysis. The development of the element equations follows the same general steps as 
used in Section 16.2 for the bar element.
The beam element with the associated nodal degrees of freedom (transverse displacement 
and rotation) is shown in Figure 16 –15.
The basic element equations are given by the general form, Eq. (16.2.10), with the 
­appropriate nodal force, stiffness, and mass matrices for a beam element. The stiffness matrix 
for the beam element is that given by Eq. (4.1.14). A lumped-mass matrix is obtained as

where one-half of the total beam mass has been lumped at each node, corresponding to the 
translational degrees of freedom. In the lumped mass approach, the inertial effect associ-
ated with possible rotational degrees of freedom has been assumed to be zero in obtaining 
Eq. (16.6.1), although a value may be assigned to these rotational degrees of freedom by 
­calculating the mass moment of inertia of a fraction of the beam segment about the nodal 
points. For a uniform beam we could then calculate the mass moment of inertia of half of the 
beam segment about each end node using basic dynamics as

Again, the lumped-mass matrix given by Eq. (16.6.1) is a diagonal matrix, making matrix 
numerical calculations easier to perform than when using the consistent-mass matrix. The 
consistent-mass matrix can be obtained by applying the general Eq. (16.2.19) for the beam 
element, where the shape functions are now given by Eqs. (4.1.7). Therefore,

Having obtained the mass matrix for the beam element, we could proceed to formulate the 
global stiffness and mass matrices and equations of the form given by Eq. (16.2.24) to solve 
the problem of a beam subjected to a time-dependent load. We will not illustrate the procedure 
for solution here because it is tedious and similar to that used to solve the one-dimensional bar 
problem in Section 16.5. However, a computer program can be used for the analysis of beams 
and frames subjected to time-dependent forces. Section 16.7 provides descriptions of plane 
frame and other element mass matrices, and Section 16.9 describes some computer program 
results for dynamics analysis of bars, beams, and frames.
To clarify the procedure for beam analysis, we will now determine the natural frequencies 
of a beam.
Example 16.5
We now consider the determination of the natural frequencies of vibration for a beam 
fixed at both ends as shown in Figure 16 –16. The beam has mass density r, modulus 
of elasticity E, cross-sectional area A, area moment of inertia I, and length 2L. For

to the exact solution results. Furthermore, if we had used the consistent-mass matrix for 
the beam [Eq. (16.6.5)], the results would have been more accurate than with the lumped-
mass matrix as consistent-mass matrices yield more accurate results for flexural elements 
such as beams.

Figure 16 –18 shows the first, second, and third mode shapes corresponding to the first three 
natural frequencies for the cantilever beam of Example 16.6 as obtained from a computer 
program. Note that each mode shape has one fewer node where a node is a point of zero 
displacement. That is, the first mode has all the elements of the beam of the same sign 
[Figure 16 –18(a)], the second mode has one sign change and at some point along the beam 
the displacement is zero [Figure 16 –18(b)], and the third mode has two sign changes and at 
two points along the beam the displacement is zero [Figure 16 –18(c)].

The dynamic analysis of the truss and that of the plane frame are performed by extending the 
concepts presented in Sections 16.2 and 16.6 to the truss and plane frame, as has previously 
been done for the static analysis of trusses and frames.
Truss Element
The truss analysis requires the same transformation of the mass matrix from local to global 
coordinates as in Eq. (3.4.22) for the stiffness matrix; that is, the global mass matrix for a truss 
element is given by

We are now dealing with motion in two or three dimensions. Therefore, we must refor-
mulate a bar element mass matrix with both axial and transverse inertial properties because 
mass is included in both the global x and y directions in plane truss analysis (Figure 16 –19). 
­Considering two-dimensional motion, we express both local axial displacement u and transverse 
displacement v for the element in terms of the local axial and transverse nodal ­displacements as

lumping mass at each node and remembering that mass is the same in both the x9 and y9 direc-

Plane Frame Element
The plane frame analysis requires first expanding and then combining the bar and beam mass 
matrices to obtain the local mass matrix. Because we recall there are six total degrees of free-
dom associated with a plane frame element (Figure 16 –20), the bar and beam mass matrices 
are expanded to order 6 × 6 and superimposed.

The global mass matrix [m] for a plane frame element arbitrarily oriented in x – y ­coordinates 
is transformed according to Eq. (16.7.1), where the transformation matrix [T] is now given by 
Eq. (5.1.10) and either Eq. (16.7.6) for consistent-mass or (16.7.7) for lumped-mass matrices.
Because a longhand solution of the time-dependent plane frame problem is quite lengthy, 
only a computer program solution will be presented in Section 16.9.

16.8  Time-Dependent Heat Transfer

	16.8 	 Time-Dependent Heat Transfer
In this section, we consider the time-dependent heat transfer problem in one dimension only. 
The basic differential equation for time-dependent heat transfer in one dimension was given 
previously by Eq. (13.1.7) with the boundary conditions given by Eqs. (13.1.10) and (13.1.11).
The finite element formulation of the equations can be obtained by minimization of the 
following functional:

Equation (16.8.1) is similar to Eq. (13.4.10) with definitions given by Eq. (13.4.11) except that 
the Q term is now replaced by
	
Q
c T
r

(16.8.2)
where, again, c is the specific heat of the material, and the dot over the variable T denotes 
differentiation with respect to time. Again, Eq. (13.4.22) obtained in Section 13.4 for the con-
ductivity or stiffness matrix and Eqs. (13.4.23) through (13.4.25) for the force matrix terms 
are applicable here.
The term given by Eq. (16.8.2) yields an additional contribution to the basic element 
equations previously obtained for the time-independent problem as follows:

The time-dependent heat-transfer problem can now be solved in a manner analogous to 
that for the stress analysis problem. We present the numerical time integration scheme.
Numerical Time Integration
The numerical time integration method described here is similar to Newmark’s method used for 
structural dynamics analysis and can be used to solve time-dependent or transient heat-transfer 
problems.
We begin by assuming that two temperature states Ti

method for numerical time integration of the second-order equations of structural dynamics, 
Eq. (16.8.11) includes a parameter b that is chosen by the user.

(16.8.16)
The time integration to solve for [T ] begins as follows. Given a known initial temperature T
{ }
0  
at time t 5 0 and a time step t
D , we solve Eq. (16.8.16) for T

1  at t
t
5 D . Then, using T
{ }

we determine T
{ }
2  at t
t

D
2(

D , the left-side coefficient of Ti 1
{
}
1  
need be evaluated only one time (assuming [M ] and [K ] do not vary with time). The matrix 
Eq. (16.8.16) can then be solved in the usual manner, such as by Gauss elimination. For a 
one-dimensional heat-transfer analysis, element [k] is given by Eqs. (13.4.22) and (13.4.28), 
whereas {ƒ} is given by Eqs. (13.4.26) and (13.4.29).
It has been shown that depending on the value of b, the time step t
D  may have an upper 
limit for the numerical analysis to be stable. If 
1

D  for stability as shown in

result, depending on specific values of b:

If b 5 0, the numerical integration method is called explicit; that is, we can solve for 
Ti 1
{
}
1  directly at time t
D  knowing only previous information at t
Ti
5 { }. If b . 0, the method 
is called implicit. If a diagonal mass-type matrix [M ] exists and b 5 0, the computational effort 
for each time step is small (see Example 16.4, where a lumped-mass matrix was used), but so 
must be t
D . The choice of b . 1
2 is often used. However, if b 5 1
2 and sharp transients exist, 
the method generates spurious oscillations in the solution. Using 
1
2
b .
, along with smaller 
t
D  [12], is probably better. Example 16.7 illustrates the solution of a one-dimensional time-­
dependent heat-transfer problem using the numerical time integration scheme [Eq. (16.8.16)].

. The initial temperature of the fin is

25 C. 
The fin length is 2 cm, and the diameter is 0.4 cm. The right tip of the fin is insulated. The 
base of the fin is then suddenly increased to a temperature of 
8
85 C and maintained at this 
temperature. Use the consistent form of the capacitance matrix, a time step of 0.1 s, and 
b 5 2

	16.9 	 Computer Program Example Solutions for Structural 
Dynamics
In this section, we report some results of structural dynamics from a computer program. We 
report the results of the natural frequencies of a fixed-fixed beam using the plane stress element 
in Autodesk [15] and compare how many elements of this type are necessary to obtain correct 
results. We also report the results of three structural dynamics problems: a bar, a beam, and a 
frame subjected to time-dependent loadings.
Finally, we show two additional models, one of a time-dependent three-dimensional gantry 
crane made of beam elements and subjected to an impact loading, and the other of a cab frame 
that travels along the underside of a crane beam.
Figure 16 –25 shows a fixed-fixed steel beam used for natural frequency determination 
using plane stress elements. Table 16 –5 shows the results of the first five natural frequencies 
using 100 elements and then using 1000 elements. Comparisons to the analytical solutions 
from beam theory are shown. We observe that it takes a large number of plane stress elements 
to accurately predict the natural frequencies whereas it only took a few beam elements to 
accurately predict natural frequencies (see Example 16.6 and Table 16 –3).
Figure 16 –26 shows a steel bar subjected to a time-dependent forcing function. Using two 
elements in the model, the nodal displacements at nodes 2 and 3 are presented in Table 16 –6. 
A time step of integration of 0.00025 s was used. This time step is based on that recommended 
by Eq. (16.5.1) and determined in Example 16.4, as the bar has the same properties as that of 
Example 16.4.
Figure 16 –27 shows a plot of the axial displacement of the free end node 3 versus time up 
to 0.01 s. Notice the oscillatory motion due to damping being neglected.

3 and a time step of integration of 0.001 s 
were used for the beam. The natural frequencies are shown in Table 16 –7.
Table 16 –7 lists the first six natural frequencies for the fixed-fixed beam. The natural 
frequencies 1, 2, 3, and 6 are flexural modes, while mode 5 is an axial mode. These modes are 
seen by looking at the modes from a frequency analysis. The undamped response of the center 
node 3 is shown in Figure 16 –29 along with a damped response subsequently described. The 
maximum displacement under the load (at node 3) compares with the solution in Reference 
[14]. This maximum displacement is at node 3 at a time of 0.086 s with a value of 31 mm. The 
static deflection for the beam with a concentrated load at mid-span is 15.9 mm as obtained 
from the classical solution of y

. The undamped time-dependent response oscil-
lates about zero deflection after the load is removed while the damped response oscillates in a 
damped manner approaching zero deflection.
A time step of 0.002 was used in the fixed-fixed beam as it meets the recommended 
time step as suggested in Section 16.3. That is,

frequency is used to decide what largest natural frequency to use in the analysis. In many 
applications only a few lower modes contribute significantly to the response. The higher 
modes are then not necessary. The highest frequency used in the analysis is called the cut-off 
frequency. For machinery parts, the cut-off frequency is often taken as high as 250 Hz. In the 
fixed-fixed beam, we have selected a cut-off frequency of f
31.44 Hz
6 5
 in determining the 
time step of integration. This frequency is the highest flexural mode frequency computed for 
the four-element beam model.
Damping
Damping is considered in the fixed-fixed beam example. Computer programs, such as Autodesk 
and ANSYS, allow you to consider damping using Rayleigh damping in the direct integration 
method. For Rayleigh damping, the damping matrix is

Using these v s and ζ s, in Eqs. (16.9.3), we obtain a 5 3.286 and b 5 0.000605. These values 
were used for a and b in the damped response for the fixed-fixed beam to include 5% damping

the solution in Reference [16].

Matrix Algebra
Introduction
In this appendix, we provide an introduction to matrix algebra. We will consider the concepts 
relevant to the finite element method to provide an adequate background for the matrix algebra 
concepts used in this text.
	 A.1 	 Definition of a Matrix
A matrix is an m
n
3  array of numbers arranged in m rows and n columns. The matrix is 
then described as being of order m
n
3 . Equation (A.1.1) illustrates a matrix with m rows and 
n columns.

(A.1.1)
If m
n
°
 in matrix Eq. (A.1.1), the matrix is called rectangular. If m 5 1 and n . 1, the 
elements of Eq. (A.1.1) form a single row called a row matrix. If m . 1 and n 5 1, the ele-
ments form a single column called a column matrix. If m
n
5 , the array is called a square 
matrix. Row matrices and rectangular matrices are denoted by using brackets [ ], and column 
matrices are denoted by using braces {}. For simplicity, matrices (row, column, or rectangular) 
are often denoted by using a line under a variable instead of surrounding it with brackets or 
braces. The order of the matrix should then be apparent from the context of its use. The force 
and displacement matrices used in structural analysis are column matrices, whereas the stiff-
ness matrix is a square matrix.
To identify an element of matrix [a], we represent the element by aij, where the subscripts 
i and j indicate the row number and the column number, respectively, of [a]. Hence, alternative 
notations for a matrix are given by

Addition of Matrices
Matrices of the same order can be added together by summing corresponding elements of 
the matrices. Subtraction is performed in a similar manner. Matrices of unlike order cannot 
be added or subtracted. Matrices of the same order can be added (or subtracted) in any order 
(the commutative law for addition applies). That is,

Again, remember that the matrices [a], [b], and [c] must all be of the same order. For instance, 
a 3
2
2 matrix cannot be added to a 3
3
3 matrix.
Multiplication of Matrices
For two matrices [a] and [b] to be multiplied in the order shown in Eq. (A.2.4), the number of 
columns in [a] must equal the number of rows in [b]. For example, consider
	
c
a b
5
[ ]
[ ][ ]	
(A.2.4)
If [a] is an m
n
3  matrix, then [b] must have n rows. Using subscript notation, we can write 
the product of matrices [a] and [b] as
	
∑
c
a b
ij
e
n
ie ej
5

[

(A.2.5)
where n is the total number of columns in [a] or of rows in [b]. For matrix [a] of order 3

and matrix [b] of order 3

Transpose of a Matrix
Any matrix, whether a row, column, or rectangular matrix, can be transposed. This operation is 
frequently used in finite element equation formulations. The transpose of a matrix [a] is com-
monly denoted by [ ]
a T. The superscript T is used to denote the transpose of a matrix throughout 
this text. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging rows and columns; that is, the 
first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.

initial matrices continues to satisfy the rule for matrix multiplication, Eq. (A.2.8). In general,

Symmetric Matrices
If a square matrix is equal to its transpose, it is called a symmetric matrix; that is, if

is a symmetric matrix because each element aij equals aji for i
j
° . In Eq. (A.2.14), note that 
the main diagonal running from the upper left corner to the lower right corner is the line of 
symmetry of the symmetric matrix [a]. Remember that only a square matrix can be symmetric.

The unit (or identity) matrix [I ] is such that

diagonal equal to one and all other elements equal to zero. For example, the 3

well) vector components of d expressed in the x – y system are related to those in the x

Equation (A.2.21) is used throughout this text to express the stiffness matrix [k] in the

By further examination of [T], we see that the trigonometric terms in [T] can be interpreted

	 A.3 	 Cofactor or Adjoint Method to Determine

We will now introduce a method for finding the inverse of a matrix. This method is useful for 
longhand determination of the inverse of smaller-order square matrices (preferably of order 
3
4
4 or less). A matrix [a] must be square for us to determine its inverse.
We must first define the determinant of a matrix. This concept is necessary in determining 
the inverse of a matrix by the cofactor method. A determinant is a scalar expressed by
	
a
aij
[ ]
[
]
5
	
(A.3.1)
where the straight vertical bars, | |, on each side of the matrix denote the determinant. The 
resulting determinant of a matrix will be a single numerical value or scalar.
To evaluate the determinant of [a], we must first determine the cofactors of aij
[
]. The 
cofactors of aij
[
] are given by

An important property associated with the determinant of a matrix is that if the determinant of 
a matrix is zero—that is, a

5 —then the matrix is said to be singular. A singular matrix 
does not have an inverse. The stiffness matrices used in the finite element method are singular 
until sufficient boundary conditions (support conditions) are applied. This characteristic of the 
stiffness matrix is further discussed in the text.
	 A.4 	 Inverse of a Matrix by Row Reduction
The inverse of a nonsingular square matrix [a] can be found by the method of row reduction 
(sometimes called the Gauss–Jordan method) by performing identical simultaneous operations 
on the matrix [a] and the identity matrix [I] (of the same order as [a]) such that the matrix [a] 
becomes an identity matrix and the original identity matrix becomes the inverse of [a].
A numerical example will best illustrate the procedure. We begin by converting matrix 
[a] to an upper triangular form by setting all elements below the main diagonal equal to zero, 
starting with the first column and continuing with succeeding columns. We then proceed from 
the last column to the first, setting all elements above the main diagonal equal to zero.
We will invert the following matrix by row reduction.

	 A.5 	 Properties of Stiffness Matrices
Stiffness matrix [k] is defined in Chapter 2 as relating nodal forces to nodal displacements. 
The stiffness matrix is also seen (for instance) in the strain energy expressions for springs, 
Eq. (2.6.20), for bars, Eq. (3.10.28b) and for beams, Eq. (4.7.21). The matrix has the properties 
of being square and symmetric, as defined in Sections A.1 and A.2, for nearly all applications 
in this textbook except for the mass transport problem in Section 13.9.
In the strain energy expression, we see [k] in the quadratic form
	
5 1
2{ } [ ]{ }
U
d
k d
T
	
(A.5.1)
For most structures, the stiffness matrix is a positive definite matrix. That means if arbi-
trary displacement vectors are chosen, and we calculate U, the result is a positive value. The 
exception to this is the trivial case where the displacement vector {d} is set to zero. Therefore, 
for any arbitrary displacements of a multi-degree-of-freedom system from its undeformed 
configuration, the strain energy is positive.

The exception to [k] being positive definite is when a system has rigid-body degrees 
of freedom. Then the displacement is taken as a rigid-body mode. In this case, [k] is called 
a positive semidefinite matrix. The strain energy U then can be zero for rigid-body modes 
or greater than zero when we have deformable modes. When [k] is positive semidefinite,

5 . Recall, from Section A.3, a matrix whose determinant is zero is called 
a singular matrix. To physically remove the singularity in a system in static equilibrium, 
­sufficient boundary conditions must be applied. This concept is further described in Chapter 2.
For instance, consider a bar with no supports as shown in Figure A–2. If the bar is discret-
ized into two elements and the 3 × 3 stiffness matrix of the bar is determined as described in 
Chapter 2 and as shown by Eq. (A.5.2), the determinant of this stiffness matrix, Eq. (A.5.3), is 
zero. Now if we fix one end of the bar, making u 5 0
1
, the reduced 2 × 2 stiffness matrix has 
a nonzero determinant. (Also see Problem A.12.)

Methods for Solution 
of Simultaneous Linear 
Equations
Introduction
Many problems in engineering and mathematical physics require the solution of a system of 
simultaneous linear algebraic equations. Stress analysis, heat transfer, and vibration analy-
sis are engineering problems for which the finite element formulation for solution typically 
involves the solving of simultaneous linear equations. This appendix introduces methods appli-
cable to both longhand and computer solutions of simultaneous linear equations. Many meth-
ods are available for the solution of equations; for brevity’s sake, we will discuss only some 
of the more common methods.

where the aij s are the coefficients of the unknown x j s, and the ci s are the known right-side 
terms. In the structural analysis problem, the aij s are the stiffness coefficients kij s, the x j s are 
the unknown nodal displacements di s, and the ci s are the known nodal forces Fi s.
If the c s are not all zero, the set of equations is nonhomogeneous, and all equations must 
be independent to yield a unique solution. Stress analysis problems typically involve solving 
sets of nonhomogeneous equations.
If the c s are all zero, the set of equations is homogeneous, and nontrivial solutions exist 
only if all equations are not independent. Buckling and vibration problems typically involve 
homogeneous sets of equations.

	 B.2 	 Uniqueness, Nonuniqueness, and Nonexistence 
of Solution
To solve a system of simultaneous linear equations means to determine a unique set of values 
(if they exist) for the unknowns that satisfy every equation of the set simultaneously. A unique 
solution exists if and only if the determinant of the square coefficient matrix is not equal to 
zero. (All of the engineering problems considered in this text result in square coefficient matri-
ces.) The problems in this text usually result in a system of equations that has a unique solution. 
Here we will briefly illustrate the concepts of uniqueness, nonuniqueness, and nonexistence of 
solution for systems of equations.

Hence the equations are called singular, and either the solution is not unique or it does not 
exist. In this case, the solution is not unique, as shown in Figure B –2.

	 B.3 	 Methods for Solving Linear Algebraic Equations
We will now present some common methods for solving systems of linear algebraic equations 
that have unique solutions. Some of these methods work best for small sets of equations solved 
longhand, whereas others are well suited for computer application.
Cramer’s Rule
We begin by introducing a method known as Cramer’s rule, which is useful for the longhand 
solution of small numbers of simultaneous equations. Consider the set of equations
	
a x
c

or, in index notation,

(B.3.2)
We first let d i
[

( )  be the matrix [a] with column i replaced by the column matrix [c]. Then the 
unknown xi’s are determined by

therefore is not used in solving large systems of simultaneous equations either longhand or

B.3  Methods for Solving Linear Algebraic Equations
847
Two methods for determining the inverse of a matrix (the cofactor method and row reduction) 
were discussed in Appendix A.
The inverse method is much more time-consuming (because much time is required to deter-
mine the inverse of [a]) than either the elimination method or the iteration method, which are 
discussed subsequently. Therefore, inversion is practical only for small systems of equations.
However, the concept of inversion is often used during the formulation of the finite element 
equations, even though elimination or iteration is used in achieving the final solution for the 
unknowns (such as nodal displacements).
Besides the tedious calculations necessary to obtain the inverse, the method usually 
involves determining the inverse of sparse, banded matrices (stiffness matrices in structural 
analysis usually contain many zeros with the nonzero coefficients located in a band around 
the main diagonal). This sparsity and banded nature can be used to advantage in terms of 
storage requirements and solution algorithms on the computer. The inverse results in a dense, 
full matrix with loss of the advantages resulting from the sparse, banded nature of the original 
coefficient matrix.
To illustrate the solution of a system of equations by the inverse method, consider the 
same equations that we solved previously by Cramer’s rule. For convenience’s sake, we repeat 
the equations here.

Gaussian Elimination
We will now consider a commonly used method called Gaussian elimination that is easily 
adapted to the computer for solving systems of simultaneous equations. It is based on trian-
gularization of the coefficient matrix and evaluation of the unknowns by back-substitution 
starting from the last equation.

Note that the pivot element was the diagonal element in each step. However, the diagonal 
element must be nonzero because we divide by it in each step. An original matrix with all 
nonzero diagonal elements does not ensure that the pivots in each step will remain nonzero, 
because we are adding numbers to equations below the pivot in each following step. Therefore, 
a test is necessary to determine whether the pivot akk at each step is zero. If it is zero, the current 
row (equation) must be interchanged with one of the following rows—usually with the next 
row unless that row has a zero at the position that would next become the pivot. Remember 
that the right-side corresponding element in {c} must also be interchanged. After making this 
test and, if necessary, interchanging the equations, continue the procedure in the usual manner.
An example will now illustrate the method for treating the occurrence of a zero pivot 
element.

It will often be convenient to set up the solution procedure by considering the coefficient

we have the augmented matrix written as

A second problem when selecting the pivots in sequential manner without testing for the

Hence, in general, the pivots should be selected as the largest (in absolute value) of 
the elements in any column. This process is called partial pivoting. Even better results 
can be obtained by choosing the pivot as the largest element in the whole matrix of the 
remaining equations and performing appropriate interchanging of rows. This is called 
complete pivoting. Complete pivoting requires a large amount of testing, so it is not rec-
ommended in general.
The finite element equations generally involve coefficients with different orders of magni-
tude, so Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting is a useful method for solving the equations.
Finally, it has been shown that for n simultaneous equations, the number of arithme-
tic operations required in Gaussian elimination is n divisions, n

Other elimination methods, including the Gauss–Jordan and Cholesky methods, have some 
advantages over Gaussian elimination and are sometimes used to solve large systems of equa-
tions. For descriptions of other methods, see References [1–3].
Gauss–Seidel Iteration
Another general class of methods (other than the elimination methods) used to solve systems 
of linear algebraic equations is the iterative methods. Iterative methods work well when the 
system of equations is large and sparse (many zero coefficients). The Gauss–Seidel method 
starts with the original set of equations a x

The following steps are then applied.
1.	
Assume a set of initial values for the unknowns x1, x2, . . ., xn, and substitute them into the 
right side of the first of Eqs. (B.3.29) to solve for the new x1.

Use the latest value for x1 obtained from Step 1 and the initial values for x3, x4, . . ., xn in 
the right side of the second of Eqs. (B.3.29) to solve for the new x2.

Continue using the latest values of the x s obtained in the left side of Eqs. (B.3.29) as the

Table B –1 lists the results of four iterations of the Gauss–Seidel method and the exact 
solution. From Table B –1, we observe that convergence to the exact solution has proceeded

 Table B –1  Results of four iterations of the Gauss–Seidel method for Eqs. (B.3.30)
In general, iteration methods are self-correcting, such that an error made in calculations 
at one iteration will be corrected by later iterations. However, there are certain systems of 
equations for which iterative methods are not convergent. The following example illustrates a 
system of equations for which the Gauss–Seidel iteration method will not converge to the exact 
solution, as the main diagonal terms are smaller than the off-diagonal terms.

When the equations can be arranged such that the diagonal terms are greater than the off-­
diagonal terms, which can be done for the previous Eq. (B.3.31), the possibility of convergence 
is usually enhanced.
Finally, it has been shown that for n simultaneous equations, the number of arithmetic 
operations required by Gauss–Seidel iteration is n divisions, n2 multiplications, and n

	 B.4 	 Banded-Symmetric Matrices, Bandwidth, 
Skyline, and Wavefront Methods
The coefficient matrix (stiffness matrix) for the linear equations that occur in structural analysis 
is always symmetric and banded. Because a meaningful analysis generally requires the use of a 
large number of variables, the implementation of compressed storage of the stiffness matrix is 
desirable both from the standpoint of fitting into memory (immediate access portion of the com-
puter) and for computational efficiency. We will discuss the banded-symmetric format, which is 
not necessarily the most efficient format but is relatively simple to implement on the computer.
Another method, based on the concept of the skyline of the stiffness matrix, is often used to 
improve the efficiency in solving the equations. The skyline is an envelope that begins with the 
first nonzero coefficient in each column of the stiffness matrix (Figure B –5). In skylining, only

the coefficients between the main diagonal and the skyline are stored (normally by successive 
columns) in a one-dimensional array. In general, this procedure takes even less storage space 
in the computer and is more efficient in terms of equation solving than the conventional banded 
format. (For more information on skylining, consult References [3, 10–11].)
A matrix is banded if the nonzero terms of the matrix are gathered about the main diag-
onal. To illustrate this concept, consider the plane truss of Figure B –4.
From Figure B –4, we see that element 2 connects nodes 1 and 4. Therefore, the 
3
2
2 
submatrices at positions 1–1, 1–4, 4–1, and 4– 4 of Figure B –5 have nonzero coefficients. 
­Figure B –5 represents the total stiffness matrix of the plane truss. The X’s denote nonzero coef-
ficients. From Figure B –5, we observe that the nonzero terms are within the band shown. When 
we use a banded storage format, only the main diagonal and the nonzero upper codiagonals 
need be stored as shown in Figure B –6. Note that any codiagonal with a nonzero term requires 
storage of the whole codiagonal and any codiagonals between it and the main diagonal. The use 
of banded storage is efficient for computational purposes. Reference [4] gives a more detailed 
explanation of banded compressed storage.

(

degrees of freedom per node and m is the maximum difference in node numbers deter-
mined by calculating the difference in node numbers for each element of a finite element

Execution time (primarily equation-solving time) is a function of the number of equations 
to be solved. It has been shown [5] that when banded storage of global stiffness matrix [K ] 
is not used, execution time is proportional to 
n
(1 / 3) 3, where n is the number of equations 
to be solved, or, equivalently, the size of [K ]. When banded storage of [K ] is used, the exe-
cution time is proportional to n nb
( )
2. The ratio of time of execution without banded storage 
to that with banded storage is then 
n nb
(1 / 3)( /
)2. For the plane truss example, this ratio is 
5
(1 / 3)(24 / 8)
3
2
. Therefore, it takes about three times as long to execute the solution of the 
example truss if banded storage is not used.
Hence, to reduce bandwidth we should number systematically and try to have a minimum 
difference between adjacent nodes. A small bandwidth is usually achieved by consecutive node 
numbering across the shorter dimension, as shown in Figure B – 4. Some computer programs 
use the banded-symmetric format for storing the global stiffness matrix, [K ].
Several automatic node-renumbering schemes have been computerized [6]. This option is 
available in most general-purpose computer programs. Alternatively, the wavefront or frontal 
method is becoming popular for optimizing equation solution time. In the wavefront method, 
elements, instead of nodes, are automatically renumbered.
In the wavefront method, the assembly of the equations alternates with their solution 
by Gauss elimination. The sequence in which the equations are processed is determined by 
element numbering rather than by node numbering. The first equations eliminated are those 
associated with element 1 only. Next, the contributions of stiffness coefficients of the adjacent 
element, element 2, are added to the system of equations. If any additional degrees of freedom 
are contributed by elements 1 and 2 only—that is, if no other elements contribute stiffness 
coefficients to specific degrees of freedom—these equations are eliminated (condensed) from 
the system of equations. As one or more additional elements make their contributions to the 
system of equations and additional degrees of freedom are contributed only by these elements, 
those degrees of freedom are eliminated from the solution. This repetitive alternation between

assembly and solution was initially seen as a wavefront that sweeps over the structure in a pat-
tern determined by the element numbering. For greater efficiency of this method, consecutive 
element numbering should be done across the structure in a direction that spans the smallest 
number of nodes.
The wavefront method, though somewhat more difficult to understand and to program 
than the banded-symmetric method, is computationally more efficient. A banded solver stores 
and processes any blocks of zeros created in assembling the stiffness matrix. In the wavefront 
method, these blocks of zero coefficients are not stored or processed. Many large-scale com-
puter programs are now using the wavefront method to solve the system of equations. (For 
additional details of this method, see References [7–9].) Example B.4 illustrates the wavefront 
method for solution of a truss problem.

(B.4.11)
The elimination procedure is now complete, and we solve Eq. (B.4.9) for u4 and v4. 
Then we back-substitute u4 and v4 into Eq. (B.4.5) to obtain u3 and v3. Finally, we 
back-substitute u3 through v4 into Eq. (B.4.1) to obtain u2 and v2. Static condensation 
and Gauss elimination with back-substitution have been used to solve the set of equa-
tions for all the degrees of freedom. The solution procedure has then proceeded as 
though it were a wave sweeping over the structure, starting at node 2, engulfing node 2 
and elements with degrees of freedom at node 2, and then sweeping through node 3 
and finally node 4.
We now describe a practical computer scheme often used in computer programs for the 
solution of the resulting system of algebraic equations. The significance of this scheme is that 
it takes advantage of the fact that the stiffness method produces a banded [K ] matrix in which 
the nonzero elements occur about the main diagonal in [K ]. While the equations are solved, 
this banded format is maintained.
Example B.5
We will now use a simple example to illustrate this computer scheme. Consider the 
three-spring assemblage shown in Figure B –8. The assemblage is subjected to forces 
at node 2 of 100 lb in the x direction and 200 lb in the y direction. Node 1 is com-
pletely constrained from displacement in both the x and y directions, whereas node 3 
is completely constrained in the y direction but is displaced a known amount d in the 
x direction.

(B.4.13)
From Eq. (B.4.13), we can see that u 5 0

, v 5 0

, v 5 0

, and u
d

. These displace-
ments are consistent with the imposed boundary conditions. The unknown displacements, 
u2 and v2, can be determined routinely by solving Eq. (B.4.13).
We will now explain the computer scheme that is generally applicable to transform 
Eq. (B.4.12) to Eq. (B.4.13). First, the terms associated with the known displacement 
boundary condition(s) within each equation were transformed to the right side of those 
equations. In the third and fourth equations of Eq. (B.4.12), k d
35  and k d
45  were trans-
formed to the right side, as shown in Eq. (B.4.13). Then the right-side force term corre-
sponding to the known displacement row was equated to the known displacement. In the 
fifth equation of Eq. (B.4.12), where u
d
5
3
, the right-side, fifth-row force term F x
3  was 
equated to the known displacement d, as shown in Eq. (B.4.13). For the homogeneous 
boundary conditions, the affected rows of {F }, corresponding to the zero-displacement 
rows, were replaced with zeros. Again, this is done in the computer scheme only to obtain 
the nodal displacements and does not imply that these nodal forces are zero. We obtain 
the unknown nodal forces by determining the nodal displacements and back-­substituting 
these results into the original Eq. (B.4.12). Because u 5 0
1
, v 5 0
1
, and v 5 0
3
 in 
Eq. (B.4.12), the first, second, and sixth rows of the force matrix of Eq. (B.4.13) were set 
to zero. Finally, for both nonhomogeneous and homogeneous boundary conditions, the 
rows and columns of [K ] corresponding to these prescribed boundary conditions were set 
to zero except the main diagonal, which was made unity. That is, the first, second, fifth, 
and sixth rows and columns of [K ] in Eq. (B.4.12) were set to zero, except for the main

diagonal terms, which were made unity. Although doing so is not necessary, setting the 
main diagonal terms equal to 1 facilitates the simultaneous solution of the six equations in 
Eq. (B.4.13) by an elimination method used in the computer program. This modification 
is shown in the [K] matrix of Eq. (B.4.13).

Equations from Elasticity 
Theory
Introduction
In this appendix, we will develop the basic equations of the theory of elasticity. These equa-
tions should be referred to frequently throughout the structural mechanics portions of this text.
There are three basic sets of equations included in theory of elasticity. These equations 
must be satisfied if an exact solution to a structural mechanics problem is to be obtained. These 
sets of equations are (1) the differential equations of equilibrium formulated here in terms of the 
stresses acting on a body, (2) the strain/displacement and compatibility differential equations, 
and (3) the stress/strain or material constitutive laws.
	 C.1 	 Differential Equations of Equilibrium
For simplicity, we initially consider the equilibrium of a deformed plane differential element 
subjected to normal stresses 
x
s  and 
y
s , in-plane shear stress τ xy (in units of force per unit area), 
and body forces Xb and Yb (in units of force per unit volume), as shown in Figure C –1. The 
stresses are assumed to be constant as they act on the width of each face. However, the stresses 
are assumed to vary from one face to the opposite. For example, we have 
x
s  acting on the left 
vertical face, whereas 
x dx
x
x
s
s
1 (
/
)


 acts on the right vertical face as there is assumed to 
be a small change in stress from the left edge of the element to the right edge. The element is 
assumed to have unit thickness.
Summing forces in the x direction, we have

C.2  Strain/Displacement and Compatibility Equations

	 C.2 	 Strain/Displacement and Compatibility Equations
We first obtain the strain/displacement or kinematic differential relationships for the two-­
dimensional case. We begin by considering the differential element shown in Figure C –3, 
where the undeformed state is represented by the dashed lines and the deformed shape (after 
straining takes place) is represented by the solid lines.
Considering line element AB in the x direction, we can see that it becomes A B
9
9 after 
deformation, where u and v represent the displacements in the x and y directions. We assume 
u and v are continuous, single-valued functions of x and y and that they are small compared to 
the dimensions of the body. By the definition of engineering normal strain (that is, the change 
in length divided by the original length of a line), we have

Equation (C.2.11) is called the condition of compatibility, and it must be satisfied by the strain 
components in order for us to obtain unique expressions for u and v. Equations (C.2.5), (C.2.6), 
(C.2.7), and (C.2.11) together are then sufficient to obtain unique single-valued functions 
for u and v.
In three dimensions, we obtain five additional compatibility equations by differentiating 
x z
g
 and yz
g
 in a manner similar to that described above for xy
g . We need not list these equations 
here; details of their derivation can be found in Reference [1].
In addition to the compatibility conditions that ensure single-valued continuous functions 
within the body, we must also satisfy displacement or kinematic boundary conditions. This 
simply means that the displacement functions must also satisfy prescribed or given displace-
ments on the surface of the body. These conditions often occur as support conditions from 
rollers and/or pins. In general, we might have

only. This is done by considering the response of a body to imposed stresses. We subject the 
body to the stresses

s  independently as shown in Figure C – 4.
We first consider the change in length of the element in the x direction due to the inde-
pendent stresses 
x
s , 
y
s , and 
z
s . We assume the principle of superposition to hold; that is, we 
assume that the resultant strain in a system due to several forces is the algebraic sum of their 
individual effects.

In this appendix, we will use the principle of virtual work to derive the general finite element 
equations for a dynamic system.
Strictly speaking, the principle of virtual work applies to a static system, but through the 
introduction of D’Alembert’s principle, we will be able to use the principle of virtual work to 
derive the finite element equations applicable for a dynamic system.
The principle of virtual work is stated as follows:
If a deformable body in equilibrium is subjected to arbitrary virtual (imaginary) 
­displacements associated with a compatible deformation of the body, the virtual 
work of external forces on the body is equal to the virtual strain energy of the 
­internal stresses.
In the principle, compatible displacements are those that satisfy the boundary conditions and 
ensure that no discontinuities, such as voids or overlaps, occur within the body. Figure E–1 
shows the hypothetical actual displacement, a compatible (admissible) displacement, and an 
incompatible (inadmissible) displacement for a simply supported beam. Here v
d  represents 
the variation in the transverse displacement function v. In the finite element formulation, v
d  
would be replaced by nodal degrees of freedom di
d . The inadmissible displacements shown 
in Figure E–1(b) are the result when the support condition at the right end of the beam and 
the continuity of displacement and slope within the beam are not satisfied. For more details 
of this principle, consult structural mechanics references such as Reference [1]. Also, for 
additional descriptions of strain energy and work done by external forces (as applied to a bar), 
see Section 3.10.
Applying the principle to a finite element, we have

where U e

From Eq. (E.2), we can observe that internal strain energy is due to internal stresses moving 
through virtual strains d«. The external virtual work is due to nodal, surface, and body forces.

in Figure E–2. According to D’Alembert’s principle, these effective forces act in directions 
that are opposite to the assumed positive sense of the accelerations. We can now express the

(E.8)
Note that the shape functions are independent of time. Because {d} (or d T
{ } ) is the matrix of 
nodal displacements, which is independent of spatial integration, we can simplify Eq. (E.8) by 
taking the d T
{ }  terms from the integrals to obtain

Because

The matrix [m] in Eq. (E.11) is the element consistent-mass matrix [2], [k] in Eq. (E.12) is the 
element stiffness matrix, fs
{ } in Eq. (E.13) is the matrix of element equivalent nodal loads due 
to surface forces, and fb
{ } in Eq. (E.14) is the matrix of element equivalent nodal loads due 
to body forces.
Specific applications of Eq. (E.15) are given in Chapter 16 for bars and beams subjected 
to dynamic (time-dependent) forces. For static problems, we set d

The values given in the table are average mechanical properties. Further veriﬁcation may be necessary for ﬁnal design or analysis. For ductile
materials, the compressive strength is normally assumed to equal the tensile strength. Abbreviations: C, compressive strength; T, tensile strength. For
an explanation of the numbers associated with the aluminums, cast irons, and steels, see ASM Metals Reference Book, latest ed., American Society
for Metals, Metals Park, Ohio 44073
