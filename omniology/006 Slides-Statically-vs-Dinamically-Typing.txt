●
 A programming language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile 
time, so before running the script. C, C++ or Java are statically typed languages.
●
Python is dynamically typed and it means that the type is associated with run-time values, 
and not with named variables. Values stored in variables have type and not the name or 
the variable itself. 
●
We can see what type of data a variable stores using the built-it type() function 
●
The built-in id( ) function returns the memory address where the value referenced by the 
variable is stored. Or simply said, it returns the address of the variable in memory.
