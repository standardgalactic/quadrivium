1,001 Calculus Practice Problems For Dummies 
xii

Introduction
T
 
his book is intended for a variety of calculus students. Perhaps you want a supplement 
to your current calculus class or you’re looking to brush up on a course you took long 
ago. Or maybe you’re teaching yourself and need a comprehensive book of extra practice 
problems.
The 1,001 questions in this book cover calculus concepts that a high school student would 
encounter in a calculus course in preparation for the AP exam. It also covers most of the 
concepts that a calculus student could expect to see in the first two semesters of a three-
semester calculus course. The types of questions are questions that I regularly assigned 
when teaching both as homework questions or are questions that a student could’ve 
expected to see on a quiz or test.
Jump around the book as you like. You can find a robust algebra and trigonometry review at 
the beginning of the book to make sure that you’re prepared for calculus. The number-one 
reason students have difficulty in calculus is not calculus itself but having a weak back-
ground in algebra and trigonometry. If you’re rusty on the fundamentals, spend time on 
those first two chapters before jumping into the rest of the text!
As with many things worth doing in life, there’s no shortcut to becoming proficient in 
mathematics. However, by practicing the problems in this book, you’ll be on your way 
to becoming a much stronger calculus student.
What You’ll Find
The 1,001 calculus practice problems in the book are divided into 15 chapters, with each 
chapter providing practice of the mechanical side of calculus or of applications of calcu-
lus. Some of the questions have a diagram or graph that you need in order to answer the 
­question.
The end of the book provides thorough and detailed solutions to all the problems. If you 
get an answer wrong, try again before reading the solution! Knowing what not to do is often 
a great starting point in discovering the correct approach, so don’t worry if you don’t 
immediately solve each question; some problems can be quite challenging.
Beyond the Book
This book provides a lot of calculus practice. If you’d also like to track your progress online, 
you’re in luck! Your book purchase comes with a free one-year subscription to all 1,001 
practice questions online. You can access the content whenever you want. Create your own 
question sets and view personalized reports that show what you need to study most.

Chapter 1
Algebra Review
P
 
erforming well in calculus is impossible without a solid algebra foundation. Many cal-
culus problems that you encounter involve a calculus concept but then require many, 
many steps of algebraic simplification. Having a strong algebra background will allow you 
to focus on the calculus concepts and not get lost in the mechanical manipulation that’s 
required to solve the problem.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you see a variety of algebra problems:
	
✓	Simplifying exponents and radicals
	
✓	Finding the inverse of a function
	
✓	Understanding and transforming graphs of common functions
	
✓	Finding the domain and range of a function using a graph
	
✓	Combining and simplifying polynomial expressions
What to Watch Out For
Don’t let common mistakes trip you up. Some of the following suggestions may be helpful:
	
✓	Be careful when using properties of exponents. For example, when multiplying 
like bases, you add the exponents, and when dividing like bases, you subtract the 
­exponents.
	
✓	Factor thoroughly in order to simplify expressions.
	
✓	Check your solutions for equations and inequalities if you’re unsure of your answer. 
Some solutions may be extraneous!
	
✓	It’s easy to forget some algebra techniques, so don’t worry if you don’t remember 
everything! Review, review, review.

Chapter 2
Trigonometry Review
I
 
n addition to having a strong algebra background, you need a strong trigonometry skill 
set for calculus. You want to know the graphs of the trigonometric functions and to be 
able to evaluate trigonometric functions quickly. Many calculus problems require one or 
more trigonometric identities, so make sure you have more than a few of them memorized 
or at least can derive them quickly.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you solve a variety of fundamental trigonometric problems that cover topics 
such as the following:
	
✓	Understanding the trigonometric functions in relation to right triangles
	
✓	Finding degree and radian measure
	
✓	Finding angles on the unit circle
	
✓	Proving identities
	
✓	Finding the amplitude, period, and phase shift of a periodic function
	
✓	Working with inverse trigonometric functions
	
✓	Solving trigonometric equations with and without using inverses
What to Watch Out For
Remember the following when working on the trigonometry review questions:
	
✓	Being able to evaluate the trigonometric functions at common angles is very important 
since they appear often in problems. Having them memorized will be extremely useful!
	
✓	Watch out when solving equations using inverse trigonometric functions. Calculators 
give only a single solution to the equation, but the equation may have many more 
(sometimes infinitely many solutions), depending on the given interval. Thinking about 
solutions on the unit circle is often a good way to visualize the other solutions.
	
✓	Although you may be most familiar with using degrees to measure angles, radians are 
used almost exclusively in calculus, so learn to love radian measure.
	
✓	Memorizing many trigonometric identities is a good idea because they appear often in 
calculus problems.

Chapter 3
Limits and Rates of Change
L
 
imits are the foundation of calculus. Being able to work with limits and to understand 
them conceptually is crucial, because key ideas and definitions in calculus make use 
of limits. This chapter examines a variety of limit problems and makes the intuitive idea 
of continuity formal by using limits. Many later problems also involve the use of limits, so 
although limits may go away for a while during your calculus studies, they’ll return!
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you encounter a variety of problems involving limits:
	
✓	Using graphs to find limits
	
✓	Finding left-hand and right-hand limits
	
✓	Determining infinite limits and limits at infinity
	
✓	Practicing many algebraic techniques to evaluate limits of the form 0/0
	
✓	Determining where a function is continuous
What to Watch Out For
You can use a variety of techniques to evaluate limits, and you want to be familiar with them 
all! Remember the following tips:
	
✓	When substituting in the limiting value, a value of zero in the denominator of a fraction 
doesn’t automatically mean that the limit does not exist! For example, if the function 
has a removable discontinuity, the limit still exists!
	
✓	Be careful with signs, as you may have to include a negative when evaluating limits at 
infinity involving radicals (especially when the variable approaches negative infinity). 
It’s easy to make a limit positive when it should have been negative!
	
✓	Know and understand the definition of continuity, which says the following: A function  
f(x) is continuous at a if lim ( )
( )
x
a f x
f a
→
=

Chapter 4
Derivative Basics
T
 
he derivative is one of the great ideas in calculus. In this chapter, you see the formal 
definition of a derivative. Understanding the formal definition is crucial, because it tells 
you what a derivative actually is. Unfortunately, computing the derivative using the defini-
tion can be quite cumbersome and is often very difficult. After finding derivatives using the 
definition, you see problems that use the power rule, which is the start of some techniques 
that make finding the derivative much easier — although still challenging in many cases.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you see the definition of a derivative and one of the first shortcut formulas, 
the power rule. Here’s what the problems cover:
	
✓	Using a variety of algebraic techniques to find the derivative using the definition of a 
derivative
	
✓	Evaluating the derivative at a point using a graph and slopes of tangent lines
	
✓	Encountering a variety of derivative questions that you can solve using the power rule
What to Watch Out For
Using the definition of a derivative to evaluate derivatives can involve quite a bit of algebra, 
so be prepared. Having all the shortcut techniques is very nice, but you’ll be asked to find 
derivatives for complicated functions, so the problems will still be challenging! Keep some 
of the following points in mind:
	
✓	Remember your algebra techniques: factoring, multiplying by conjugates, working with 
fractions, and more. Many students get tripped up on one part and then can’t finish the 
problem, so know that many problems require multiple steps.
	
✓	When interpreting the value of a derivative from a graph, think about the slope of the 
tangent line on the graph at a given point; you’ll be well on your way to finding the 
­correct solution.
	
✓	Simplifying functions using algebra and trigonometric identities before finding the 
derivative makes many problems much easier. Simplifying is one of the very first things 
you should consider when encountering a “find the derivative” question of any type.

Chapter 5
The Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules
T
 
his chapter focuses on some of the major techniques needed to find the derivative: the 
product rule, the quotient rule, and the chain rule. By using these rules along with the 
power rule and some basic formulas (see Chapter 4), you can find the derivatives of most of 
the single-variable functions you encounter in calculus. However, after using the derivative 
rules, you often need many algebra steps to simplify the function so that it’s in a nice final 
form, especially on problems involving the product rule or quotient rule.
The Problems You’ll Work On
Here you practice using most of the techniques needed to find derivatives (besides the 
power rule):
	
✓	The product rule
	
✓	The quotient rule
	
✓	The chain rule
	
✓	Derivatives involving trigonometric functions
What to Watch Out For
Many of these problems require one calculus step and then many steps of algebraic sim-
plification to get to the final answer. Remember the following tips as you work through the 
problems:
	
✓	Considering simplifying a function before taking the derivative. Simplifying before 
taking the derivative is almost always easier than finding the derivative and then  
simplifying.
	
✓	Some problems have functions without specified formulas in the questions; don’t be 
thrown off! Simply proceed as you normally would on a similar example.
	
✓	Many people make the mistake of using the product rule when they should be using the 
chain rule. Stop and examine the function before jumping in and taking the derivative. 
Make sure you recognize whether the question involves a product or a composition  
(in which case you must use the chain rule).
	
✓	Rewriting the function by adding parentheses or brackets may be helpful, especially  
on problems that involve using the chain rule multiple times.

Chapter 6
Exponential and Logarithmic  
Functions and Tangent Lines
A
 
fter becoming familiar with the derivative techniques of the power, product, quotient, 
and chain rules, you simply need to know basic formulas for different functions. In this 
chapter, you see the derivative formulas for exponential and logarithmic functions. Knowing 
the derivative formulas for logarithmic functions also makes it possible to use logarithmic 
differentiation to find derivatives.
In many examples and applications, finding either the tangent line or the normal line to a 
function at a point is desirable. This chapter arms you with all the derivative techniques, so 
you’ll be in a position to find tangent lines and normal lines for many functions.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you do the following types of problems:
	
✓	Finding derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions with a variety of bases
	
✓	Using logarithmic differentiation to find a derivative
	
✓	Finding the tangent line or normal line at a point
What to Watch Out For
Although you’re practicing basic formulas for exponential and logarithmic functions, you 
still use the product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule as before. Here are some tips for 
solving these problems:
	
✓	Using logarithmic differentiation requires being familiar with the properties of  
logarithms, so make sure you can expand expressions containing logarithms.
	
✓	If you see an exponent involving something other than just the variable x, you likely 
need to use the chain rule to find the derivative.
	
✓	The tangent line and normal line are perpendicular to each other, so the slopes of 
these lines are opposite reciprocals.

Chapter 7
Implicit Differentiation
W
 
hen you know the techniques of implicit differentiation (this chapter) and  
logarithmic differentiation (covered in Chapter 6), you’re in a position to find the 
derivative of just about any function you encounter in a single-variable calculus course. 
Of course, you’ll still use the power, product, quotient, and chain rules (Chapters 4 and 5) 
when finding derivatives.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you use implicit differentiation to
	
✓	Find the first derivative and second derivative of an implicit function
	
✓	Find slopes of tangent lines at given points
	
✓	Find equations of tangent lines at given points
What to Watch Out For
Lots of numbers and variables are floating around in these examples, so don’t lose 
your way:
	
✓	Don’t forget to multiply by dy/dx at the appropriate moment! If you aren’t getting the 
correct solution, look for this mistake.
	
✓	After finding the second derivative of an implicitly defined function, substitute in the 
first derivative in order to write the second derivative in terms of x and y.
	
✓	When you substitute the first derivative into the second derivative, be prepared to  
further simplify.

Chapter 8
Applications of Derivatives
W
 
hat good are derivatives if you can’t do anything useful with them? Well, don’t worry! 
There are tons and tons of useful applications involving derivatives. This chapter 
illustrates how calculus can help solve a variety of practical problems, including finding 
maximum and minimum values of functions, approximating roots of equations, and finding 
the velocity and acceleration of an object, just to name a few. Without calculus, many of 
these problems would be very difficult indeed!
The Problems You’ll Work On
This chapter has a variety of applications of derivatives, including
	
✓	Approximating values of a function using linearization
	
✓	Approximating roots of equations using Newton’s method
	
✓	Finding the optimal solution to a problem by finding a maximum or minimum value
	
✓	Determining how quantities vary in relation to each other
	
✓	Locating absolute and local maxima and minima
	
✓	Finding the instantaneous velocity and acceleration of an object
	
✓	Using Rolle’s theorem and the mean value theorem
What to Watch Out For
This chapter presents a variety of applications and word problems, and you may have  
to be a bit creative when setting up some of the problems. Here are some tips:
	
✓	Think about what your variables represent in the optimization and related-rates  
problems; if you can’t explain what they represent, start over!
	
✓	You’ll have to produce equations in the related-rates and optimization problems. 
Getting started is often the most difficult part, so just dive in and try different things.
	
✓	Remember that linearization is just a fancy way of saying “tangent line.”
	
✓	Although things should be set up nicely in most of the problems, note that Newton’s 
method doesn’t always work; its success depends on your starting value.

Chapter 9
Areas and Riemann Sums
T
 
his chapter provides some of the groundwork and motivation for antiderivatives. 
Finding the area underneath a curve has real-world applications; however, for 
many curves, finding the area is difficult if not impossible to do using simple geometry. 
Here, you approximate the area under a curve by using rectangles and then turn to 
Riemann sums. The problems involving Riemann sums can be quite long and involved, 
especially because shortcuts to finding the solution do exist; however, the approach used 
in Riemann sums is the same approach you use when tackling definite integrals. It’s worth 
understanding the idea behind Riemann sums so you can apply that approach to other 
problems!
The Problems You’ll Work On
This chapter presents the following types of problems:
	
✓	Using left endpoints, right endpoints, and midpoints to estimate the area underneath 
a curve
	
✓	Finding an expression for the definite integral using Riemann sums
	
✓	Expressing a given Riemann sum as a definite integral
	
✓	Evaluating definite integrals using Riemann sums
What to Watch Out For
Here are some things to keep in mind as you do the problems in this chapter:
	
✓	Estimating the area under a curve typically involves quite a bit of arithmetic but 
shouldn’t be too difficult conceptually. The process should be straightforward after 
you do a few problems.
	
✓	The problems on expressing a given Riemann sum as a definite integral don’t always 
have unique solutions.
	
✓	To evaluate the problems involving Riemann sums, you need to know a few summation 
formulas. You can find them in any standard calculus text if you don’t remember them — 
or you can derive them!

Chapter 10
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 
and the Net Change Theorem
U
 
sing Riemann sums to evaluate definite integrals (see Chapter 9) can be a cumber-
some process. Fortunately, the fundamental theorem of calculus gives you a much 
easier way to evaluate definite integrals. In addition to evaluating definite integrals in this 
chapter, you start finding antiderivatives, or indefinite integrals. The net change theorem 
problems at the end of this chapter offer some insight into the use of definite integrals.
Although the antiderivative problems you encounter in this chapter aren’t too complex, finding 
antiderivatives is in general a much more difficult process than finding derivatives, so consider 
yourself warned! You encounter many challenging antiderivative problems in later chapters.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you see a variety of antiderivative problems:
	
✓	Finding derivatives of integrals
	
✓	Evaluating definite integrals
	
✓	Computing indefinite integrals
	
✓	Using the net change theorem to interpret definite integrals and to find the distance 
and displacement of a particle
What to Watch Out For
Although many of the problems in the chapter are easier antiderivative problems, you still 
need to be careful. Here are some tips:
	
✓	Simplify before computing the antiderivative. Don’t forget to use trigonometric identi-
ties when simplifying the integrand.
	
✓	You don’t often see problems that ask you to find derivatives of integrals, but make 
sure you practice them. They usually aren’t that difficult, so they make for easier 
points on a quiz or test.
	
✓	Note the difference between distance and displacement; distance is always greater than 
or equal to zero, whereas displacement may be positive, negative, or zero! Finding the 
distance traveled typically involves more work than simply finding the displacement.

Chapter 11
Applications of Integration
T
 
his chapter presents questions related to applications of integrals: finding the area between 
curves, finding the volumes of a solid, and calculating the work done by a varying force. The 
work problems contain a variety of questions, all of which apply to a number of real-life situa-
tions and relate to questions that you may encounter in a physics class. At the end of the chap-
ter, you answer questions related to finding the average value of a function on an interval.
The Problems You’ll Work On
In this chapter, you see a variety of applications of the definite integral:
	
✓	Finding areas between curves
	
✓	Using the disk/washer method to find volumes of revolution
	
✓	Using the shell method to find volumes of revolution
	
✓	Finding volumes of solids using cross-sectional slices
	
✓	Finding the amount of work done when applying a force to an object
	
✓	Finding the average value of a continuous function on an interval
What to Watch Out For
Here are a few things to consider for the problems in this chapter:
	
✓	Make graphs for the area and volume problems to help you visualize as much as possible.
	
✓	Don’t get the formulas and procedures for the disk/washer method mixed up with the 
shell method; it’s easy to do! For example, when rotating regions about a ­horizontal 
line using disks/washers, your curve should be of the form y = f(x), but if you’re using 
shells, your curve should be of the form x = g(y). When rotating a region about a 
­vertical line and using disks/washers, your curve should be of the form x = g(y), but if 
you’re using shells, your curve should be of the form y = f(x).
	
✓	Some of the volume of revolution problems can be solved using either the disk/washer 
method or the shell method; other problems can be solved easily only by using one 
method. Pay attention to which problems seem to be doable using either method and 
which ones do not.
	
✓	The work problems often give people a bit of a challenge, so don’t worry if your first 
attempt isn’t correct. Keep trying!

Chapter 12
Inverse Trigonometric Functions, 
Hyperbolic Functions, and  
L’Hôpital’s Rule
T
 
his chapter looks at the very important inverse trigonometric functions and the 
hyperbolic functions. For these functions, you see lots of examples related to finding 
derivatives and integration as well. Although you don’t spend much time on the hyperbolic 
functions in most calculus courses, the inverse trigonometric functions come up again 
and again; the inverse tangent function is especially important when you tackle the partial 
­fraction problems of Chapter 14. At the end of this chapter, you experience a blast from the 
past: limit problems!
The Problems You’ll Work On
This chapter has a variety of limit, derivative, and integration problems. Here’s what you 
work on:
	
✓	Finding derivatives and antiderivatives using inverse trigonometric functions
	
✓	Finding derivatives and antiderivatives using hyperbolic functions
	
✓	Using L’Hôpital’s rule to evaluate limits
What to Watch Out For
Here are a few things to consider for the problems in this chapter:
	
✓	The derivative questions just involve new formulas; the power, product, quotient, and 
chain rules still apply.
	
✓	Know the definitions of the hyperbolic functions so that if you forget any formulas, you 
can easily derive them. They’re simply defined in terms of the exponential function, ex.
	
✓	Although L’Hôpital’s rule is great for many limit problems, make sure you have an 
­indeterminate form before you use it, or you can get some very incorrect solutions.

Chapter 13
U-Substitution and Integration  
by Parts
I
 
n this chapter, you encounter some of the more advanced integration techniques:  
u-substitution and integration by parts. You use u-substitution very, very often in integra-
tion problems. For many integration problems, consider starting with a u-substitution if you 
don’t immediately know the antiderivative. Another common technique is integration by 
parts, which comes from the product rule for derivatives. One of the difficult things about 
these problems is that even when you know which procedure to use, you still have some 
freedom in how to proceed; what to do isn’t always clear, so dive in and try different things.
The Problems You’ll Work On
This chapter is the start of more challenging integration problems. You work on the  
following skills:
	
✓	Using u-substitution to find definite and indefinite integrals
	
✓	Using integration by parts to find definite and indefinite integrals
What to Watch Out For
Here are a few things to keep in mind while working on the problems in this chapter:
	
✓	Even if you know you should use a substitution, there may be different substitutions 
to try. As a rule, start simple and make your substitution more complex if your first 
choice doesn’t work.
	
✓	When using a u-substitution, don’t forget to calculate du, the differential.
	
✓	You can algebraically manipulate both du and the original u-substitution, so play  
with both!
	
✓	For the integration by parts problems, if your pick of u and dv don’t seem to be  
working, try switching them.

Chapter 14
Trigonometric Integrals, Trigonometric 
Substitution, and Partial Fractions
T
 
his chapter covers trigonometric integrals, trigonometric substitutions, and partial 
fractions — the remaining integration techniques you encounter in a second-semester 
calculus course (in addition to u-substitution and integration by parts; see Chapter 13). In a 
sense, these techniques are nothing fancy. For the trigonometric integrals, you typically use 
a u-substitution followed by a trigonometric identity, possibly throwing in a bit of algebra to 
solve the problem. For the trigonometric substitutions, you’re often integrating a function 
involving a radical; by picking a clever substitution, you can often remove the radical and 
make the problem into a trigonometric integral and proceed from there. Last, the partial 
fractions technique simply decomposes a rational function into a bunch of simple fractions 
that are easier to integrate.
With that said, many of these problems have many steps and require you to know identities, 
polynomial long division, derivative formulas, and more. Many of these problems test your 
algebra and trigonometry skills as much as your calculus skills.
The Problems You’ll Work On
This chapter finishes off the integration techniques that you see in a calculus class:
	
✓	Solving definite and indefinite integrals involving powers of trigonometric functions
	
✓	Solving definite and indefinite integrals using trigonometric substitutions
	
✓	Solving definite and indefinite integrals using partial fraction decompositions

Part I: The Questions 
What to Watch Out For
You can get tripped up in a lot of little places on these problems, but hopefully these 
tips will help:
	
✓	Not all of the trigonometric integrals fit into a nice mold. Try identities,  
u-substitutions, and simplifying the integral if you get stuck.
	
✓	You may have to use trigonometry and right triangles in the trigonometric  
substitution problems to recover the original variable.
	
✓	If you’ve forgotten how to do polynomial long division, you can find some  
examples in Chapter 1’s algebra review.
	
✓	The trigonometric substitution problems turn into trigonometric integral  
problems, so make sure you can solve a variety of the latter problems!

Chapter 15
Improper Integrals and More 
Approximating Techniques
T
 
he problems in this chapter involve improper integrals and two techniques to approxi-
mate definite integrals: Simpson’s rule and the trapezoid rule. Improper integrals are 
definite integrals with limits thrown in, so those problems require you to make use of many 
different calculus techniques; they can be quite challenging. The last few problems of the 
chapter involve using Simpson’s rule and the trapezoid rule to approximate definite inte-
grals. When you know the formulas for these approximating techniques, the problems are 
more of an arithmetic chore than anything else.
The Problems You’ll Work On
This chapter involves the following tasks:
	
✓	Solving improper integrals using definite integrals and limits
	
✓	Using comparison to show whether an improper integral converges or diverges
	
✓	Approximating definite integrals using Simpson’s rule and the trapezoid rule
What to Watch Out For
Here are a few pointers to help you finish the problems in this chapter:
	
✓	Improper integrals involve it all: limits, l’Hôpital’s rule, and any of the integration  
techniques.
	
✓	The formulas for Simpson’s rule and the trapezoid rule are similar, so don’t mix  
them up!
	
✓	If you’re careful with the arithmetic on Simpson’s rule and the trapezoid rule,  
you should be in good shape.

y = 3x + 8
Recall that a function is one-to-one if it satisfies the requirement that if x1 ≠ x2, then  
f (x1) ≠ f (x2); that is, no two x coordinates have the same y value. If you consider the 
graph of such a function, no horizontal line would cross the graph in more than one 
place.
Of the given functions, only the linear function y = 3x + 8 passes the horizontal line test. 
This function is therefore one-to-one and has an inverse.

y = x2 – 4, x ≥ 0
When determining whether a function has an inverse, consider the domain of the given 
function. Some functions don’t pass the horizontal line test — and therefore don’t have 
an inverse — unless the domain is restricted. The function y = x2 – 4 doesn’t pass the 
horizontal line test; however, if you restrict the domain to x ≥ 0, then y = x2 – 4 does 
pass the horizontal line test (and therefore has an inverse), because you’re getting 
only the right half of the parabola.
	
23.	
y = tan−1 x
Of the given functions, only the function y = tan−1 x passes the horizontal line test. 
Therefore, this function is one-to-one and has an inverse.

{(1, 0), (4, 3), (–6, 5)}
If the point (a, b) is on the graph of a one-to-one function, the point (b, a) is on the 
graph of the inverse function. Therefore, just switch the x and y coordinates to get that 
the set of points {(1, 0), (4, 3), (–6, 5)} belongs to the graph of f −1(x).

domain: (–1, 2); range: [–2, 4)
For a one-to-one function (which by definition has an inverse), the domain of f (x) 
becomes the range of f −1(x), and the range of f (x) becomes the domain of f −1(x). 
Therefore, f −1(x) has domain (–1, 2) and range [–2, 4).
	
32.	
g −1(x) = f −1(x) – c
Replacing x with (x + c) shifts the graph c units to the left, assuming that c > 0. If the point 
(a, b) belongs to the graph of f (x), then the point (a – c, b) belongs to the graph of f (x + c).
Now consider the inverse. The point (b, a) belongs to the graph of f −1(x), so the point 
(b, a – c) belongs to the graph of g −1(x). Therefore, g −1(x) is the graph of f −1(x) shifted 
down c units so that g −1(x) = f −1(x) – c.
The same argument applies if c < 0.

x = –3, 9
To solve an absolute value equation of the form a

two equations a = b and a = –b. So for the equation x

To solve x2 – 6x = 27, set the equation equal to zero and factor using trial and error:

Setting each factor equal to zero gives you x – 9 = 0, which has the solution x = 9, and  
x + 3 = 0, which has the solution x = –3.
Then set x2 – 6x = –27 equal to zero, giving you x2 – 6x + 27 = 0. This equation doesn’t 
factor nicely, so use the quadratic equation, with a = 1, b = –6, and c = 27:

To solve the inequality x2 – 4x – 32 < 0, begin by solving the corresponding equation  
x2 – 4x – 32 = 0. Then pick a point from each interval (determined by the solutions) to 
test in the original inequality.
Factoring x2 – 4x – 32 = 0 gives you (x + 4)(x – 8) = 0. Setting the first factor equal to 
zero gives you x + 4 = 0, which has the solution x = –4, and setting the second factor 
equal to zero gives you x – 8 = 0, which has the solution x = 8.
Therefore, you need to pick a point from each of the intervals, (–∞, –4), (–4, 8), and  
(8, ∞), to test in the original inequality. Substitute each test number into the expression  
x2 – 4x – 32 to see whether the answer is less than or greater than zero.

0, first determine which values 
will make the numerator equal to zero and which values will make the denominator 
equal to zero. This helps you identify zeros (where the graph crosses the x-axis) and 
points where the function is not continuous.
From the numerator, you have x + 1 = 0, which has the solution x = –1. You also have  
x – 2 = 0, which has the solution x = 2. From the denominator, you have x + 3 = 0, which 
has the solution x = –3. Take a point from each interval determined by these solutions 
and test it in the original inequality.
You need to test a point from each of the intervals, (–∞, –3), (–3, –1), (–1, 2), and (2, ∞).

The equation of a line that goes through the point (x1, y1) and has a slope of m is given 
by the point-slope formula: y – y1 = m(x – x1).
The two lines are parallel, so the slopes are the same. Therefore, the slope of the line 
you’re trying to find is m = 3

Using the slope and the point (1, 5) in the point-slope formula gives you

The slopes of perpendicular lines are opposite reciprocals of each other, so the slope 
of the line you want to find is m = 3

y = 3(x – 5)2 + 2

Another option is simply to count and determine that the new vertex is at (5, 2); then 
use the vertex form y = a(x – h)2 + k, where the vertex is at the point (h, k).

y = e−2x – 5
To compress the graph of y = ex horizontally by a factor of 2, replace x with 2x to get  
y = e2x. To reflect the graph of y = e2x across the y-axis, replace x with –x to get y = e2(–x), 
or y = e−2x. Last, to shift the graph of y = e−2x down 5 units, subtract 5 from the right side 
of the equation to get y = e−2x – 5.
Here’s the graph of y = e−2x – 5:

The function is continuous on its domain.
The lowest x coordinate occurs at the point (–2, 3), and then the graph extends indefi-

the point (–1, 1), and then the graph extends indefinitely upward; therefore, the range

Notice that the function is continuous on its domain.
For the portion of the graph that’s to the left of the y-axis, there’s no largest x value 
due to the hole at (–1, –1); instead, the x values get arbitrarily close to –1. The graph 
then extends indefinitely to the left so that the domain for the left side of the graph is 
(–∞, –1). There’s also no largest y value due to the hole at (–1, –1); the y values get 
­arbitrarily close to –1. The graph then decreases as it approaches the horizontal 
asymptote at y = –3, so the range for this portion of the graph is (–3, –1).
For the portion of the graph that’s to the right of the y-axis, the smallest x value is at 
the point (2, 2). The graph then extends indefinitely to the right, so the domain for the 
right side of the graph is [2, ∞). The smallest y value also occurs at the point (2, 2), and 
then the graph increases as it approaches the horizontal asymptote at y = 4; therefore, 
the range of this portion of the graph is [2, 4).

First add a placeholder for the missing x2 term in the numerator. Rewriting  
x3 – 2x + 6 as x3 + 0x2 – 2x + 6 will make all the like terms line up when you  
do the long division, making the subtraction a bit easier to follow.

To make the first right triangle, use tan−1(2) = α. You know that 2 = tan α, and you can find 
the missing side of the first right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem:
As for the second right triangle, because tan−1(3) = β, you know that 3 = tan β. Again,

Likewise, there’s a solution to the equation sin( )
y = 3
5 in the second quadrant because 
the function also has positive values there, namely π – 0.644; adding 2π gives you the 
other solution, 3π – 0.644. Therefore, y = 0.644, π – 0.644, 2π + 0.644, and 3π – 0.644 are 
all solutions.

You can also use the substitution y = 3x to simplify the equation. Because 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, it

It follows that in the interval [0, 6π], y = 2π + 0.963 and y = 4π + 0.963 are also solutions 
because adding multiples of 2π makes the resulting angles fall at the same places on 
the unit circle.
Likewise, there’s a solution to the equation cos y = 4
7 in the fourth quadrant 
because cosine also has positive values there, namely y = 2π – 0.963. Because y = 2π – 
0.963 is a solution, it follows that y = 4π – 0.963 and y = 6π – 0.963 are also solutions.
Therefore, you have y = 0.963, 2π – 0.963, 2π + 0.963, 4π – 0.963, 4π + 0.963, and  
6π – 0.963 as solutions to cos y = 4

Note that substituting in the limiting value gives you the indeterminate form 0
0.
Examine both the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to determine whether the limits 
are equal. To find the left-hand limit, consider values that are slightly smaller than 4
3 and 
substitute into the limit. Notice that to simplify the absolute value in the ­denominator of 
the fraction, you replace the absolute values bars with parentheses and add a negative 
sign, because substituting in a value less than 4
3 will make the number in the parentheses 
negative; the extra negative sign will make the value positive again.

You deal with the right-hand limit similarly. Here, when removing the absolute value 
bars, you simply replace them with parentheses; you don’t need the negative sign 
because the value in the parentheses is positive when you’re substituting in a value 
larger than 4

removable discontinuity at x = –3, jump discontinuity at x = 3
The limit exists at x = –3 but isn’t equal to f (–3), which corresponds to a removable 
discontinuity.
At x = 3, the left-hand limit doesn’t equal the right-hand limit (both limits exist as finite 
values); this corresponds to a jump discontinuity.

253.	
removable discontinuity at x = 1, infinite discontinuity at x = 5
The limit exists at x = 1, but f (1) is undefined, which corresponds to a removable 
discontinuity.
At x = 5, the left-hand limit is ∞ and the right-hand limit is –∞, so an infinite discontinu-
ity exists at x = 5.
	
254.	
jump discontinuity at x = –2, jump discontinuity at x = 3
At x = –2, the left-hand limit doesn’t equal the right-hand limit (both limits exist as 
finite values), which corresponds to a jump discontinuity.
At x = 3, the left-hand limit again doesn’t equal the right-hand limit (both limits exist as 
finite values), so this also corresponds to a jump discontinuity.
	
255.	
removable discontinuity at x = –1, jump discontinuity at x = 4, infinite discontinuity at x = 6
At x = –1, the left-hand limit equals the right-hand limit, but the limit doesn’t equal f (–1), 
which is undefined. Therefore, a removable discontinuity is at x = –1.
At x = 4, the left-hand limit doesn’t equal the right-hand limit (both limits exist as finite 
values), so a jump discontinuity is at x = 4.
At x = 6, both the left and right-hand limits equal ∞, so an infinite discontinuity is at x = 6.
	
256.	
not continuous, infinite discontinuity
A function f (x) is continuous at x = a if it satisfies the equation lim

The left-hand limit at a is given by lim

x = 1
The graph has a point of discontinuity at x = 1, so the graph isn’t differentiable there. 
However, the rest of the graph is smooth and continuous, so the derivative exists for 
all other points.

differentiable everywhere
Because the graph is continuous and smooth everywhere, the function is differentiable 
everywhere.
	
274.	
x = –2, x = 0, x = 2
The graph of the function has sharp corners at x = –2, x = 0, and x = 2, so the  
function isn’t differentiable there.
You can also note that for each of the points x = –2, x = 0, and x = 2, the slopes of the 
tangent lines jump from 1 to –1 or from –1 to 1. This jump in slopes is another way  
to recognize values of x where the function is not differentiable.

To rationalize the numerator, consider the formula a3 – b3 = (a – b)(a2 + ab + b2). If you 
let a = (2x + 2h + 1)1/3 and b = (2x + 1)1/3, you have (a – b) in the numerator; that means 
you can rationalize the numerator by multiplying by (a2 + ab + b2):

The tangent line at x = 3 is horizontal, so the slope is zero. Therefore, f  '(3) = 0.
	
292.	
–1
The slope of the tangent line at x = –1 is equal to –1, so f  '(–1) = –1.
	
293.

The slope of the tangent line at x = –3 is equal to 1, so f  '(–3) =1.
	
294.	
3
The slope of the tangent line at any point on the graph of y = 3x + 4 is equal to 3,  
so f  '(–22π3) = 3.
	
295.	
f  '(1) < f  '(–2) < f  '(–3)
The tangent line at x = –3 has a positive slope, the slope of the tangent line at x = –2  
is equal to zero, and the slope of the tangent line at x = 1 is negative. Therefore,  
f    '(1) < f  '(–2) < f  '(–3).

f   '(1) < f  '(2) < 0.1 < f  '(5)
The slope of the tangent line at x = 1 is negative, the slope of the tangent line at x = 2 is 
equal to zero, and the slope of the tangent line at x = 5 is clearly larger than 0.1. 
Therefore, f  '(1) < f  '(2) < 0.1 < f  '(5).

Use basic derivative rules to get f  '(x) = 5.

Apply the power rule to each term, recalling that the derivative of a constant is zero:

Next, set each factor equal to zero and solve for x: sin x = 0 has the solutions x = 0, π, 
2π, and cos x – 1 = 0, or cos x = 1, has the solutions x = 0, 2π. The slope of the tangent 
line is zero at each of these x values, so the solutions are x = 0, π, 2π.

no absolute maximum; absolute minimum: y = –1; no local maxima; local minimum: (1, –1)

are also no local maxima. The absolute minimum is y = –1. The point (1, –1) is a local

absolute maximum: y = 3; no absolute minimum; local maxima: (3, 3), (5, 3); local  
	
	
minimum: (4, 1)
The absolute maximum value is 3, which the graph attains at the points (3, 3) and  
(5, 3). The function approaches the x-axis but doesn’t cross or touch it, so there’s no 
absolute minimum. The points (3, 3) and (5, 3) also correspond to local maxima, and 
the local minimum occurs at (4, 1).

no maxima or minima
The graph has no absolute maximum or minimum because the graph approaches ∞  
on the left and –∞ on the right. Likewise, there are no local maxima or minima because 
(2, 1) and (5, 3) are points of discontinuity.
	
450.

Because Point A satisfies the definition of both a local maximum and a local minimum, 
it’s both. The graph decreases to negative infinity on the left side, so Point A is not an 
absolute minimum.

Next, find any critical numbers of the function by setting the numerator and denomina-
tor of the derivative equal to zero and solving for t.
From the numerator of the derivative, you have 4 – 2t2 = 0 so that 4 = 2t2, or 2 = t2, which 
has the solutions t = ± 2. From the denominator, you have 4 – t2 = 0, or 4 = t2, which has 
the solutions t = ±2.

Begin by finding the derivative of the function; then find any critical numbers on the 
given interval by determining where the derivative equals zero or is undefined. Note 
that by finding critical numbers, you’re finding potential turning points or cusp points

Setting the derivative equal to zero in order to find the critical points gives you  
x2 – 4 = 0, or x2 = 4, so that x = ±2.
To determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, substitute a test point inside 
each interval into the derivative to see whether the derivative is positive or negative.
To test (–∞, –2), you can use x = –3. In that case, f '(–3) = 6(–3)2 – 24 = 30. The derivative 
is positive, so the function is increasing on (–∞, –2). Proceed in a similar manner for 
the intervals (–2, 2) and (2, ∞). When x = 0, you have f '(0) = 6(0)2 – 24 = –24, so the 
function is decreasing on (–2, 2). And if x = 3, then f '(3) = 6(3)2 – 24 = 30, so the function 
is increasing on (2, ∞).

Next, find any critical numbers that fall inside the interval (–3, ∞) by setting the deriva-

because the denominator will never equal zero.) This gives you 3x + 6 = 0, or x = –2.

Therefore, f (x) is increasing on (–∞, –1), decreasing on (–1, 2), and increasing again on 
(2, ∞). That means there’s a local maximum at x = –1 and a local minimum at x = 2.
Now enter these values in the original function to find the coordinates of the local maxi-
mum and minimum. Because f (–1) = 2(–1)3 – 3(–1)2 – 12(–1) = 7, the local maximum occurs 
at (–1, 7). Because f (2) = 2(2)3 – 3(2)2 – 12(2) = –20, the local minimum occurs at (2, –20).

That means f (x) has a local minimum at x = 0; f (0) = 0, so a local minimum occurs at (0, 0). 
Also, f (x) has a local maximum at x = 64; f (64) = 6(64)2/3 – 64 = 32, so the local maximum

concave up on (1, ∞); concave down on (–∞, 1)
To determine concavity, examine the second derivative. Because a derivative measures 
a “rate of change” and the first derivative of a function gives the slopes of tangent 
lines, the derivative of the derivative (the second derivative) measures the rate of 
change of the slopes of the tangent lines. If the second derivative is positive on an 
interval, the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing, so the function is bending 
upward, or is concave up. Likewise, if the second derivative is negative on an interval, 
the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing, so the function is bending downward, or 
is concave down.
Begin by finding the first and second derivatives of the function f (x) = x3 – 3x2 + 4:

Setting the second derivative equal to zero gives you 6x – 6 = 0 so that x = 1.
To determine the concavity on the intervals (–∞, 1) and (1, ∞), pick a point from each 
interval and substitute it into the second derivative to see whether it’s positive or neg-
ative. Using the values x = 0 and x = 2, you have f "(0) = 6(0) – 6 < 0 and f "(2) = 6(2) – 6 > 0.  
Therefore, f (x) is concave up on the interval (1, ∞) and concave down on the  
interval (–∞, 1).

no inflection points
Inflection points are points where the function changes concavity. To determine concav-
ity, examine the second derivative. Because a derivative measures a “rate of change” and 
the first derivative of a function gives the slopes of tangent lines, the derivative of the 
derivative (the second derivative) measures the rate of change of the slopes of the tan-
gent lines. If the second derivative is positive on an interval, the slopes of the tangent 
lines are increasing, so the function is bending upward, or is concave up. Likewise, if the 
second derivative is negative on an interval, the slopes of the tangent lines are decreas-
ing, so the function is bending downward, or is concave down.

Notice that the numerator of the second derivative never equals zero and that the

Next, find where the second derivative is equal to zero or undefined. Setting the 
numerator equal to zero gives you sin x = 0, which has solutions x = 0, x = π, and x = 2π. 
Setting the denominator equal to zero gives you 1 + cos x = 0, or cos x = –1, which has 
the solution x = π.
To determine the concavity on the intervals (0, π) and (π, 2π), pick a point from each inter-
val and substitute it into the second derivative to see whether it’s positive or negative. 
Using the values x = π

Therefore, the concavity changes when x = π. The corresponding y value on f (x) is  
f (π) = 3 sin π – (sin π)3 = 0, so the inflection point is (π, 0).

Next, find where the second derivative is equal to zero or undefined by setting the 
numerator and the denominator equal to zero. For the numerator, you have 10x + 10 = 0, 
which has the solution x = –1. For the denominator, you have 9x4/3 = 0, which has the 
solution x = 0.

To determine the concavity on the intervals (–∞, –1), (1, 0), and (0, ∞), pick a point 
from each interval and substitute it into the second derivative to see whether it’s positive

5 ft/s
One way to find the maximum height of the stone is to determine when the velocity of 
the stone is zero, because that’s when the stone stops going upward and begins falling. 
(The stone follows a parabolic path, so you can also use the formula to find the vertex, 
but try the calculus way instead.)
Finding the derivative of the position function gives you the velocity function:

Because x = 3 makes the volume zero, you know that x = 1 gives you a maximum, 
which you can verify by using the first derivative test.
Using V = (6 – 2x)(6 – 2x)x and x = 1 gives you the volume:

Let x be the distance of the object from the brighter light source and k be the strength 
of the weaker light source. The illumination of each light source is directly propor-

Newton’s method begins by making one side of the equation zero, labeling the other 
side f (x), and then picking a value of x1 that’s “close” to a root of f (x). There’s certainly 
a bit of trial and error involved; in this case, you could graph both y = cos x and y = x 
and look for a point of intersection to get a rough idea of what the root may be.

Because the given function has values that are strictly greater than or equal to zero on 
the given interval, you can interpret the Riemann sum as approximating the area that’s 
underneath the curve and bounded below by the x-axis.
You want to use eight rectangles of equal width to estimate the area under f (x) = e3x + 4 
over the interval 1 ≤ x ≤ 9. Begin by dividing the length of the interval by 8 to find the 
width of each rectangle:
∆
=
−
=
x

Then divide the interval [1, 9] into 8 equal pieces, each with a width of 1, to get the inter-
vals [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], and [8, 9]. Using the left endpoint of each 
interval to calculate the heights of the rectangles gives you the values x = 1, x = 2, x = 3,  
x = 4, x = 5, x = 6, x = 7, and x = 8. The height of each rectangle is f (x). To approximate the 
area under the curve, multiply the width of each rectangle by f (x) and add the areas:

You want to use four rectangles of equal width to estimate the area under f (x) = 1 + 2x 
over the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 4. Begin by dividing the length of the interval by 4 to find the 
width of each rectangle:
∆

Then divide the interval [0, 4] into 4 equal pieces, each with a width of 1, to get the 
intervals [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], and [3, 4]. Using the right endpoint of each interval to  
calculate the heights of the rectangles gives you the values x = 1, x = 2, x = 3, and x = 4. 
The height of each rectangle is f (x). To approximate the area under the curve, multiply 
the width of each rectangle by f (x) and add the areas:

Because the given function has values that are strictly greater than or equal to zero on 
the given interval, you can interpret the Riemann sum as approximating the area that’s 
underneath the curve and bounded below by the x-axis.
You want to use eight rectangles of equal width over the interval 1 ≤ x ≤ 5. Begin by 
dividing the length of the interval by 8 to find the width of each rectangle:
∆x =

Then divide the interval [1, 5] into 8 equal pieces, each with a width of 1

Recall that in the limit representation of a definite integral, you divide the interval over 
which you’re integrating into n pieces of equal width. You also have to select a point from 
each interval; the formula a + (Δ x)i lets you select the right endpoint of each interval.
Begin by looking for the factor that would represent Δ x. In this example, ∆x
n
= 3; if you 
ignore the n in this expression, you’re left with the length of the interval over which 
the definite integral is being evaluated. In this case, the length of the interval is 3. 
Notice that if you consider 4
3

n , this is of the form a + (Δ x)i, where a = 4.
You now have a value for a and know the length of the interval, so you can conclude 
that you’re integrating over the interval [4, 7]. To produce the function, replace each

Because r(t) is the rate at which oil leaks from a tanker in gallons per minute, you can 
write r(t) = –V'(t), where V(t) is the volume of the oil at time t. Notice that you need the 
minus sign because the volume is decreasing, so V'(t) is negative but r(t) is positive. By 
the net change theorem, you have

Note that displacement, or change in position, can be positive or negative or zero. You 
can think of the particle moving to the left if the displacement is negative and moving 
to the right if the displacement is positive.
Velocity is the rate of change in displacement with respect to time, so if you integrate 
the velocity function over an interval where the velocity is negative, you’re finding how 
far the particle travels to the left over that time interval (the value of the integral is 
negative to indicate that the displacement is to the left). Likewise, if you integrate the 
velocity function over an interval where the velocity is positive, you’re finding the dis-
tance that the particle travels to the right over that time interval (in this case, the 
value of the integral is positive). By combining these two values — that is, by integrat-
ing the velocity function over the given time interval — you find the net displacement.
To find the displacement, simply integrate the velocity function over the given interval:

Note that displacement, or change in position, can be positive or negative or zero. You 
can think of the particle moving to the left if the displacement is negative and moving 
to the right if the displacement is positive.
Velocity is the rate of change in displacement with respect to time, so if you integrate 
the velocity function over an interval where the velocity is negative, you’re finding how 
far the particle travels to the left over that time interval (the value of the integral is neg-
ative to indicate that the displacement is to the left). Likewise, if you integrate the veloc-
ity function over an interval where the velocity is positive, you’re finding the distance 
that the particle travels to the right over that time interval (in this case, the value of the 
integral is positive). By combining these two values, you find the net displacement.
Unlike displacement, distance can’t be negative. In order to find the distance traveled, 
you can integrate the absolute value of the velocity function because you’re then inte-
grating a function that’s greater than or equal to zero on the given interval.

Because the derivative of the position function is the rate of change in position with 
respect to time, the derivative of the position function gives you the velocity function. 
Likewise, the derivative of the velocity function is the rate of change in velocity with 
respect to time, so the derivative of the velocity function gives you the acceleration 
function. It follows that the antiderivative of the acceleration function is the velocity 
function and that the antiderivative of the velocity function is the position function.
First find the velocity function by evaluating the antiderivative of the acceleration  
function, a(t) = t + 2:

Because the derivative of the position function is the rate of change in position with 
respect to time, the derivative of the position function gives you the velocity function. 
Likewise, the derivative of the velocity function is the rate of change in velocity with 
respect to time, so the derivative of the velocity function gives you the acceleration 
function. It follows that the antiderivative of the acceleration function is the velocity 
function and that the antiderivative of the velocity function is the position function.
Note that displacement, or change in position, can be positive or negative or zero. You 
can think of the particle moving to the left if the displacement is negative and moving 
to the right if the displacement is positive. But unlike displacement, distance can’t be 
negative. To find the distance traveled, you can integrate the absolute value of the 
velocity function because you’re then integrating a function that’s greater than or 
equal to zero on the given interval.
Begin by finding the velocity function by evaluating the antiderivative of the accelera-
tion function, a(t) = t + 2:

In this case, integrating with respect to y makes sense. You could integrate with 
respect to x, but you’d have to solve x = 2y2 for y and then use two integrals to com-
pute the area, because the “top function” isn’t the same for the entire region.
Begin by isolating x in the second equation to get x = 1 – y. Then find the points of 
intersection by setting the expressions equal to each other and solving for y:

, pick a

In this example, integrating with respect to y makes sense. You could integrate with 
respect to x, but you’d have to solve both x = 2 – y2 and x = y2 – 2 for y and then use two 
integrals to compute the area, because the “top function” and the “bottom function” 
aren’t the same for the entire region. (You could actually reduce the region to a single 
integral by using symmetry, but that isn’t possible in general.)

Notice that you can easily solve the two equations for x, so integrating with respect to 
y makes sense. If you were to solve the second equation for y in order to integrate with 
respect to x, you’d have to use more than one integral to set up the area.
Solve the first equation for x to get x = –y. Then find the points of intersection by

To determine which curve has the larger x values for y on the interval (0, 5), take a 
point in the interval and substitute it into each equation. So if y = 1, then x = 12 – 1 = 0 
and x = 4(1) = 4. Therefore, the integral to find the area of the region is

Notice that you can easily solve the two equations for x, so integrating with respect to 
y makes sense. If you were to solve the second equation for y in order to integrate with 
respect to x, you’d have to complete the square to solve for y, which would needlessly 
complicate the problem.
Begin by solving both equations for x to get x
y
=
−

 and x = y + 1. Then set the 
expressions equal to each other and solve for y to find the points of intersection:

Begin by finding all the points of intersection of the three functions. To do so, solve 
each equation for y and then set the functions equal to each other. Solving the second 
equation for y gives you y
x
= −2, and solving the third equation for y gives you 
y = 3 – 2x. Set these two functions equal to each other and solve for x:

Likewise, finding the other points of intersection gives you x
x
= −2 so that x = 0 is a 
solution and gives you x = 3 – 2x so that x = 1 is a solution.
Notice that on the interval (0, 1), the region is bounded above by the function y = x and 
below by the function y
x
= −2. On the interval (1, 2), the region is bounded above by 
the function y = 3 – 2x and below by the function y
x

Recall the definition of volume: Let S be a solid that lies between x = a and x = b. If A(x) 
is the cross-sectional area of S in the plane Px that goes through x and is perpendicular 
to the x-axis, where A is a continuous function, then the volume of S is
V
A x dx

b
= ∫

Because the cross-sectional slice is a circle in this case, you have A(x) = π(y)2 = π(f (x))2.
To get the lower limit of integration, find where the function y

Because the cross-sectional slice is a circle in this case, you have A(y) = π(x)2 = π(g(y))2.

Here’s the region that’s being rotated. Because the cross-sectional slice is a circle, you

At x = 0, you have y = 02/3 = 0, which will be the lower limit of integration; y = 1 corre-
sponds to the upper limit of integration.
Solving the equation y = x2/3 for x gives you x = y3/2. Note that because you’re rotating

If you consider a cross-sectional slice at point (x, y) on the circle, where y > 0, the base 
of the square equals 2y; therefore, the area of the cross-sectional slice is (2y)2 = 4y2.
In order to integrate with respect to x, you can solve the equation of the circle for y2 
and write the area as 4y2 = 4(16 – x2) = A(x). Because the base of the solid varies for x 
over the interval [–4, 4], the limits of integration are –4 and 4. Therefore, the integral to

bounds the region above and let g(x) be the function that bounds the region below; the 
shell height is given by f (x) – g(x). Note that the limits of integration often correspond 
to points of intersection.
The line x = 2 gives you one of the limits of integration, so begin by finding the other 
limit of integration by determining where the function intersects the x-axis; 0 = x2 gives 
you 0 = x. Notice that the shell radius is (x + 1), so here’s the integral to find the volume 
using cylindrical shells:

from x to the line of rotation. To find the shell height, let f (x) be the function that 
bounds the region above and let g(x) be the function that bounds the region below; the 
shell height is given by f (x) – g(x). Note that the limits of integration often correspond 
to points of intersection.
In this example, the limits of integration are given as x = 0 and x =
π , and the shell 
height is sin(x2) – 0, so the integral becomes

To evaluate this integral, use the substitution u = x2 so that du = 2 dx, or 1

can find the new limits of integration by noting that if x =
π , then u = (

 and 
that if x = 0, then u = 02 = 0. Using these values gives you

note that the region being rotated is below the line of rotation y = 1, so in the interval  
(0, 1), the distance from y to the line of rotation is (1 – y), making the shell radius (1 – y).

To find the shell radius, let y be in the interval [c, d]; the shell radius is the distance

the region on the right and let g(y) be the curve that bounds the region on the left; the 
shell height is given by f (y) – g(y). Note that the limits of integration often correspond 
to points of intersection.
One of the limits of integration, y = 0, is given. Begin by finding the points of intersec-

equal to each other. Square both sides and factor to solve for x:

Begin by using the information about how much work is required to stretch the spring 
from 8 to 10 centimeters to solve for the spring constant and the natural length of the 
spring; you do so by setting up a system of equations.
You don’t know the natural length L for the integral involved in stretching the spring 
from 8 centimeters to 10 centimeters beyond its natural length, so the limits of integra-
tion for one of the integrals involving work are from 0.08 – L to 0.10 – L. Likewise, the 
other integral will have limits of integration from 0.10 – L to 0.12 – L. Therefore, you 
have the following two equations for work:

Now solve for the spring constant k. By subtracting 20 = k[0.0036 – 0.04L] from

tion 20 = k[0.0036 – 0.04L] gives you 20 = 10,000[0.0036 – 0.04L], and solving for L yields 
0.04 m = L. Therefore, the natural length of the spring is 4 centimeters.

Begin by using the information about how much work is required to stretch the spring 
from 40 to 60 centimeters (0.40 to 0.60 meters) beyond its natural length to solve for the 
spring constant and the natural length of the spring; to do so, set up a system of equations.
Because you don’t know the natural length L for the integral involved in stretching the 
spring from 0.40 meters to 0.60 meters beyond its natural length, the limits of integra-
tion for one of the integrals involving work are from 0.40 – L to 0.60 – L. Likewise, the 
other integral will have limits of integration from 0.60 – L to 0.80 – L. Therefore, you 
have the following two equations for work:

Now solve for the spring constant k. By subtracting 50 = k[0.2 – 0.4L] from 80 = k[0.28 – 
0.4L], you’re left with 30 = k(0.08) so that k = 375.
Finally, find the natural length of the spring. Substituting the value of k into the equa-
tion 50 = k[0.2 – 0.4L] gives you 50 = 375[0.2 – 0.4L]; solving for L yields L = 1
6 meters, so 
the natural length of the spring is approximately 16.67 centimeters.

At first, you may have trouble seeing how a substitution will work for this problem.  
But note that you can split x5 into x3x2:
x

dx
x
x
x dx

0
1

3
3
2
0
1

∫
∫
Now you can use the substitution u = x3 + 1 so that u – 1 = x3 and du = 3x2 dx, or 
1
3
2
du
x dx
=
. Notice that you can find the new limits of integration by noting that if  
x = 1, then u = 13 + 1 = 2, and if x = 0, then u = 03 + 1 = 1. With these values, you  
get the following integral:

First begin with the substitution u = cos t, which gives you du = –sin t dt, or –du = sin t dt. 
You can also compute the new limits of integration: If t = π

if t = 0, then u = cos 0 = 1. Substituting these values into the integral gives you

Equating coefficients gives you the equations 0 = A + B, 0 = –A + B + C, and 1 = A + C. 
From the first of the three equations, you have A = –B, and from the third, you get  
1 – A = C so that 1 + B = C. Using the equation 0 = –A + B + C with A = –B and with  
1 + B = C gives you 0 = –(–B) + B + (1 + B) so that −

About the Author
Patrick Jones (also known as PatrickJMT) has a master’s degree in Mathematics from 
the University of Louisville. Although he also did a bit of PhD work at Vanderbilt 
University, he decided that the academic life was not the correct path for him because 
he wanted to focus more on the teaching aspect instead of spending time on research. 
He has one mathematics paper published, for which he received Erdõs number 2, and 
after that his research days came to an end.
In addition to teaching at the University of Louisville and Vanderbilt University, he has 
taught classes at Austin Community College.
While teaching, he also did some tutoring on the side and decided that he enjoyed the 
one-on-one aspect of tutoring over the stand-and-lecture mode of teaching. Because 
every student has questions outside of the classroom, he started posting short supple-
ments for his students on YouTube under the name PatrickJMT. Although he thought 
only his students would watch the videos, positive feedback from all over the world 
came in, and he started posting more and more videos — so began the video-making 
career of PatrickJMT. Now Patrick primarily spends his time expanding his video 
library, although he does regular consulting work for many other projects as well.
In addition to being one very happy guy professionally, he is an avid cyclist and chess 
player, although he doesn’t claim to be very good at either activity.

Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Matt Wagner of Fresh Books, Inc., for approaching me with the 
offer of writing this book; Lindsay Lefevere, who was my initial contact at Wiley and got 
the ball rolling; Chrissy Guthrie at Wiley for being such an easy and accommodating 
person to work with on this project; and Mary Jane Sterling, who was my mentor for 
the project and gave much-appreciated and encouraging feedback early on. In addition, 
I would like to give an absolute booming shout out of gratitude to Jeane Wenzel, who 
typed up many, many pages of messy handwritten notes and did a fabulous job of proof-
ing the work both mathematically and grammatically.
