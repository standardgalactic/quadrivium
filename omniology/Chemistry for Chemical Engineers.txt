Two of the main distinctions between chemical engineers and other engineering disciplines are the topics 
of mass and energy balances. Within these two topics there are a lot of underlying chemical principles that 
help chemical engineers to perform calculations to determine what is happening in a system, allowing 
better control of a process.
This book will outline the basic chemistry principles that are required by chemical engineers to understand 
chemical reactions and relate them to the main themes of mass and energy balances. It does not serve 
as a complete account of all the chemistry that is important for chemical engineering but should give a 
grounding, which can be supplemented by reading further into the areas discussed, if required.

Quantifying systems
Working as a chemical engineer requires a capacity to interpret data and quantities provided from different 
sources. It is essential that any quantities used or calculated are recorded correctly, as the inclusion or 
omission of units changes the context dramatically. For example 7 is a purely numerical quantity, but 
adding a unit, say kilograms so the measurement becomes 7 kg, conveys significantly more information. In 
all working it is important to write down both numerical values and the corresponding units; as a result, 
it is necessary to appreciate the relationship between certain units and have an ability to convert between 
quantities. The properties that can be measured, such as time, length and mass, are known as dimensions 
and can also be composed from multiplying or dividing other dimensions, for example velocity (length/
time). Units can be treated like algebraic variables when quantities are added, subtracted, multiplied or 
divided but note that numerical values may only be added or subtracted if their units are the same. The 
most common set of units that chemical engineers come into contact with are the seven fundamental 
S.I. units of measurement, as defined in the International System of Units (the abbreviation S.I. comes 
from the French for this classification: Système Internationale d’Unités). The system was developed in 
1960 and has been widely accepted by the science and engineering communities.
The table below shows the seven base units and their corresponding abbreviations, as chemical engineers 
the most commonly used units will be those for amount of substance, mass, length, temperature and, 
importantly, time.

these can be converted to other systems of measurement that represent the equivalent dimension, such 
alternative units are referred also known as base units but not S.I., so for the example of length one 
could use (ft).

Sometimes, quantities are calculated from several dimensions, this is very common in chemical 
engineering where flowrates, such as mass or volumetric flowrate are frequently used. In this case the 
quantities are measured as mass/time (kg/s) and volume/time (m3/s); the corresponding units are a 
composition of all the dimensions involved and are known as derived units.
Common derived units are listed in the table below. It should be noted that these dimensions have their 
own unit and abbreviated notation, in addition to that from their derivation.

Note 1 N is defined as being equivalent to 1 kg m/s2 because a force of 1 N produces an acceleration of 
1 m/s2 when applied to a mass of 1 kg. It is, therefore, useful to remember that 1J Ł 1 N m Ł 1kg m2 s-2 
in order to simplify complex units generated in some equations.
The base units are not always the most useful mathematical representation of the numerical value 
determined and may be necessary to use other methods to simplify the quantity. For example, 60 s can 
be represented as 1 minute (1 min), similarly 0.000001 s could be represented as 10-6 s or 1 ms, the latter 
unit (microseconds) and min are known as multiple units, and it is essential to be able to understand 
not only the quantities involved in a system but also their level of scale. Chemical engineers must be 
comfortable with the common prefixes used with S.I. units and other units from around the globe.

Quantifying systems
Converting units is an essential skill for all chemical engineers and the easiest method to use is fractional 
representation. This keeps track of all numerical values and units throughout the conversion performed, 
allowing those units that cancel to be easily identified.
The equivalence between two expressions of a given quantity may be defined in terms of a ratio (expressed 
here in common fraction notation):
mm
 
10
cm
 1
 1 centimetre per 10 millimetres
Ratios of this form are called conversion factors. Generally, when converting units, multiply by conversion 
factor(s) as fractions with new units as the numerator (top) and old units as the denominator (bottom). 
For example, convert 100 mm into cm:
ͳͲͲ݉݉ൈͳܿ݉
ͳͲ݉݉ൌͳͲܿ݉
Worked example – convert the gas constant from 8.314 J mol-1 K-1 to Btu lb-mol-1 ºC-1, using the following 
conversions:
1 kJ = 0.9478 Btu; 1 kmol = 2.205 lb-mol; 1 K = 1 ºC
Firstly, write out the value given in fractional format: 
K
 
mol
J 
8.314
Then write out each of the required conversions in the same format, making sure that the units match 
and can cancel out in the working. For example, if the value to be converted has J on the top line, and 
the conversion of 1 kJ = 0.9478 Btu is to be applied, it is firstly required that J is converted to kJ. To do 
this, divide through by 1000 J and multiplying by kJ (as 1 kJ = 103 J = 1000 J). After this, kJ is now on 
the top line:

Extreme care must be taken when converting squared and cubed dimensions, remember that not only the 
numerical value needs to be squared or cubed, the units must be treated in the same way. For example, 
converting 0.6 m3 to ft3, using the conversion 1m = 3.281 ft, requires that the fractional conversion is 
applied and cubed in its entirety. It is important to note that all four terms in the conversion must then

Atoms and bonding
Atoms and bonding
Understanding atomic and molecular structure is essential in determining several reaction parameters 
and provides chemical engineers with a deeper insight into the mechanics behind the process being 
controlled or scaled-up. This knowledge also provides a common language for use with scientists and 
engineers from other disciplines ensuring everyone follows a discussion or document fully. There are 
several particles and modes of reaction chemistry that require definition.
The atom
Atoms are basic building blocks of chemical structures; the Greek name means indivisible suggesting 
their role as base chemical building blocks. They consist of a dense nucleus (containing over 99% of the 
mass), generally composed of protons and neutrons, which is surrounded by an electron cloud. Protons 
are positively charged, neutrons are, as their name somewhat suggests, neutral and electrons carry a 
negative charge. Electromagnetic forces, involving the charged species, bind the electron cloud to the 
nucleus. Similar attractions bind atoms to each other to produce molecules. 
Atoms are small, low weight, neutral species, unless they have undergone addition or loss of electrons 
to produce negatively or positively, respectively, charged atoms known as ions. Elements consist of 
atoms of only one type, and an element is defined as matter that cannot be broken down further by 
chemical methods. Each element can be identified by the number of protons and neutrons contained 
in the nucleus; the number of protons governs the element and the number of neutrons dictates which 
isotope of the element is being studied.
The concept of atoms being indivisible has existed for centuries and is related to the law of conservation 
of mass, but in the late 1800’s to early 1900’s, this idea was replaced by that of the existence of subatomic 
particles, such as the electron discovered by J.J. Johnson, which became the subject of much research. 
The atom was no longer unable to be broken down, as defines an element, but it was by physics rather 
than chemistry that this was discovered. The nucleus, as a dense positive mass, was proposed by Ernest 
Rutherford as a result of experiments using alpha rays (positive helium ions) to bombard gold foil
Atomic theory was developed in the early 19th century, when John Dalton used atoms as the rationale 
for the way elements react in specific proportions, i.e. small whole numbers, and the reason that some 
gases dissolve better in water; postulating that elements are composed of small units called atoms and 
these react to produce larger chemical species. This hypothesis was built on, and eventually verified, 
over the years with evidence including the determination of the size of atoms, the discovery of Brownian 
motion and a combination of theoretical and experimental methods to measure the mass and physical 
dimensions of atoms.

Atoms and bonding
J.J. Johnson proposed a model based on a cloud of electrons, with a balancing positive cloud, however 
Rutherford’s work disproved this theory. Consequently Niels Bohr suggested that electrons are in fact 
confined in well defined, quantised orbits, between which electronic transitions can occur by the 
absorption or emission of specific, quantised packets of energy. This refined the atomic model to the 
point where it was accepted that atomic number is equal to the atomic nuclear charge of a given element. 
The atom consists of a number of sub particles and units.
Nucleus – The components of a nucleus, proton and neutrons, collectively called nucleons, are held 
together by the strong forces associated with gluons, an elementary particle. The nucleons are bound 
together by the short-ranged residual strong force, which is an attractive potential and exceeds that 
lesser electrostatic repulsion of like charged particles. By overcoming the binding energy of the nucleus, 
nucleons may be lost from the atom forming an isotope, discussed in more detail later. The number of 
protons in the nucleus determines the element and this value is known as the atomic number, the number 
of neutrons determines the isotope of the given element. The total number of nucleons determines the 
nuclide. Some nuclei may then become unstable and be subject to radioactive decay. The energetics of 
the nucleus are complex with protons and neutrons being unable to occupy the same quantum physical 
state as their own type as described by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Generally, atoms with low atomic 
numbers are most stable when they have similar numbers of protons and neutrons. For heavier atoms 
the electrostatic repulsion of the increasing number of protons requires more neutrons to maintain 
stability, tending towards a ratio of 1.5.
Protons – With a mass of 1.6726 x 10-27 kg (1836 x me), ignoring binding energy changes, protons have 
dimensions of approximately 2.5 x 10-15 m and carry a positive charge equal in magnitude to an electron. 
Protons themselves contain the smaller basic units called quarks, which are one of the second smaller 
basic components of matter, known as fermions. They contain two up quarks (+⅔) and one down quark 
(-⅓) giving a net charge of +1.
Neutrons – With comparable dimensions to protons, neutrons are marginally greater in mass at  
1.6929 x 10-27 kg. They have no electrical charge and are, like protons, composed of quarks, in this case 
one up quark (+⅔) and two down quarks (-⅓), giving a net charge of 0. 
Electrons – The particle with the least mass (me = 9.11 x 10-31 kg), the electron is negatively charged and 
too small to be measured by current experimental methods. The electron is an example of a lepton – one 
of the basic components of matter. Electrons are bound to the nucleus by electromagnetic forces and 
control the chemistry of the element, influencing the reactivity and bonding. In order for an electron 
to be lost from the atom, external energy is required, proportional to the energy binding the electron 
to the nucleus, and is significantly less than the binding energy of the nucleus itself. The energy needed 
for electron loss increases the closer the electron is to the nucleus. If an atom has the same number of 
protons and electrons, the charges balance and the atom is said to be neutral. An inequality, with either 
an excess or deficit of electrons, results in a charged atom, known as an ion.

Atomic properties
Due to the structure of atomic orbitals, atoms may lack a defined shape so the atomic radius, the  
distance to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus, is used to define their size and is often 
calculated from the distance between two atoms joined in a chemical bond. This has limitations as it 
assumes a perfectly spherical shape, and is dependent on the type of bond and the number of neighbouring 
atoms.
Atoms, as stated above, are composed of smaller particles and this discovery caused myriad models to 
be proposed regarding the interaction of these particles with those of other atoms. Such models include 
Thomson’s plum pudding model, which stated electrons orbited a jelly-like positive matter in rings akin 
to the planets orbiting the sun. Shortly thereafter Nagaoka proposed a model where a dense central 
positive core attracted the electrons into orbiting rings, similar to the rings of Saturn. This model has 
a major flaw in that, classically, charged objects have no means of sustaining an orbit due to radiative 
energy loss through acceleration. However, Nagaoka was a lot closer than any of his contemporaries and 
eventually the Bohr model was developed.
Rutherford determined that the positive mass of an atom exists in the densely packed nucleus, eliminating 
a number of models, including the plum pudding model. On the basis of this, Bohr suggested a model 
where the nucleus was orbited by electrons contained in discrete shells but where the electrons could only 
take specific angular momentum values; this addressed the issue of energy loss. By setting conditions for 
electrons to satisfy, this also explained the quantised spectral lines obtained in absorption and emission 
spectra of atomic species. The wavelength associated with the energy loss or gain gave weight to the 
theory electrons behave like waves and, eventually, the concept of wave/particle duality.
Many particles, including electrons, possess the properties of both a particle and a wave, in the case 
of an electron meaning that the particle forms a three-dimensional standing wave in the potential well 
created by the forces between the nucleus and electron. This standing wave has no relative movement with 
respect to the nucleus and is defined by an atomic orbital, mathematically representing the probability 
of the location of an electron at the time of measurement. These atomic orbitals are well defined and 
only exist in specific forms that are the most stable orbitals, with a range of nodes, shapes, sizes and 
orientations. The concept of electrons acting as waves allows their behaviour to be accurately described 
by quantum mechanical theory and limiting criteria such as the Pauli exclusion principle, which is related 
to spin of electrons in a given orbital, and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity, a maximum of two 
electrons with opposite spin may occupy one orbital, as well as giving rise to phenomena such as the 
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that a particles such as electrons would require infinite 
angular momentum in order to occupy a specific geometric position in space since their wave function 
is based on a frequency distribution.

To exist in a given atomic orbital, the electron must have a specific energy particular to that orbital, 
energy gain or loss can move electrons between orbitals. Such energy changes are provided by the 
absorption or emission of a photon, the energy of which can be interpreted to give information about 
the atom studied. Each atomic orbital has a specific set of characteristics that must be satisfied for an 
electronic transition to be permitted. These characteristics are the angular momentum (l), angular 
momentum direction (m) and energy (n) of the orbital. The orbitals have letters: s, p, d and f (l = 0, 1, 
2 and 3, respectively) indicating their shape and electronic configurations. The names derive from the 
characteristic spectroscopic lines observed for each orbital: sharp, principal, diffuse and fundamental. 
g-orbitals are ignored herein for simplification as they will not be necessary for most chemistry covered 
within a chemical engineering degree.
The complete electron cloud for an atom is, approximately, a summation of all these orbitals, where 
electrons are paired and arranged, according to energy (n) and angular momentum (m), in sets of 
repeating units of incrementally increasing odd integers: 1, 3, 5, 7 (s, p, d and f, related to l), which 
explains the repeating periodicity of 2, 6, 10 and 14 elements in the periodic table. The fact that elements 
in the same group exhibit similar chemical properties was not fully understood at first using the Bohr 
model but each group of orbitals holds different numbers of electrons giving similar outer shell valences 
for members of the same group even though they differ markedly in electron number. This is related to 
the existence of groups of atomic orbitals.

s-orbitals – exist as singular orbitals and are spherically shaped, here l = 0. If the energy level is 1, i.e. 
n = 1, then this orbital is very dense at the centre, fading exponentially towards the outer edge, it is 
approximately solid. For n = 2 and higher there exist spherically symmetric surfaces as an array of nested 
shells. All s-orbitals have an anti-node at their radial centre, which is a region of high wave function 
density and is at the centre of the nucleus. As the other three types of orbitals (p, d and f) possess angular 
momentum they avoid the nucleus, consequently having a wave node at the nucleus in contrast.
p-orbitals – are present from n = 2 upwards and are elliptical in shape, consisting of three pairs of ellipses 
that have a point of tangency at the nucleus, hence the wave node, and resemble a trio of dumbbells. The 
three orbitals are oriented along the three (x, y, z) axes and may be individually referred to as px, py and pz.
d-orbitals – are present from n = 3 and in keeping with the 2x-1 series within the orbitals have 5 wave 
functions in ψ2 form. Four of these are similar with two pairs of ellipses, like the p-orbitals each, such 
that each of the four d-orbitals have 4 lobes. They lie along the xy, xz, yz and the fourth has centres on 
both x and y axes, and are referred to as dxy, dxz, dyz and dx2-y2. The fifth d-orbital consists of a single pair 
of ellipses along the z-axis, with a torus, a doughnut shaped ring, around their centre, it is known as dz2.
It is evident that the complexity of the orbitals increases along the series and the f-orbitals and g-orbitals 
are too complex to describe here. It is sufficient to know that there are seven f-orbitals (fz3, fxz2, fyz2, fxyz, 
fz(x2-y2), fx(x2-3y2), fy(3x2-y2)) and that they are present from n = 4.
The electrons furthest from the nucleus, i.e. in the outermost orbitals, can be shared by or transferred 
to other atoms to allow the formation of molecules and other chemical species via bonds.
Molecular orbitals
Similar to the way that atomic orbitals (AOs) describe the wave function of an electron in an atom, 
molecular orbitals (or MOs) are mathematical functions that describe the behaviour of electrons within 
molecules. As such, MOs are usually formed by the combination of AOs, or in some cases hybrid orbitals, 
from each atom in the molecule and the overall MO can be used to predict chemical and physical 
characteristics. The use of atomic orbitals to represent MOs is called the linear combination of atomic 
orbitals (LCAO-MO) method.
MOs are essentially Schrödinger orbitals with more than one, but often only two, nuclei. The actual 
formation of a MO is governed by the symmetries of the AOs and whether this is allowed can be 
determined using group theory. It should be noted that the number of MOs formed should be the same 
as the number of AOs combining to form them.
There are a variety of MOs that can form, these being bonding, anti-bonding and non-bonding MOs.

Atoms and bonding
Bonding MOs – Bonding MOs have lower energies than the combined AOs used to produce them, the 
bonding interactions between the AOs are constructive. Bonding MOs have within them electrons with 
a higher probability of being found between the nuclei than any other location in the molecule, tending 
to hold the nuclei, hence, the molecule together. Thus they are referred to as bonding MOs.
Anti-bonding MOs – Anti-bonding MOs have higher energies than the combined AOs used to produce 
them, the bonding interactions between the AOs are destructive. Anti-bonding MOs have within them 
electrons with a higher probability of being found at any location in the molecule other than between 
the nuclei, tending to weaken the interaction between the nuclei, hence, the molecule. Thus they are 
referred to as anti-bonding MOs.
Non-bonding MOs – Non-bonding MOs have the same energy as the AOs of one of the atoms in 
the molecule, there are no bonding interactions between the AOs, usually as a result of incompatible 
symmetries. Non-bonding MOs tend to be deep, almost atomic, orbitals and, as such electrons tend to 
be associated with one nucleus or another, neither strengthening nor weakening the bond.
HOMO and LUMO – the difference in energy of individual electrons within a molecule can be a 
useful quantity to determine and is called the band gap, and gives an indication of how easily excited 
a molecule is, which has applications in semiconductor development. The band gap relates the energy 
difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO).
Bond symmetry
The interactions that occur when AOs are combined can be categorised into either sigma (σ) or pi (π) 
symmetries. σ -symmetry MOs are the result of the interaction of two s-AOs or two pz-AOs, and occur 
if the orbital and axis joining the two AOs are symmetrical with respect to each other, this is called the 
internuclear axis, and rotation about this axis does not result in a phase change, this lack of phase change 
on rotation is also the case for σ* MOs (sigma antibonding). π -symmetry MOs are the result of the 
interaction of two px-AOs or two py-AOs, and occur if the orbital and internuclear axis are asymmetrical, 
i.e. rotation about this axis causes a phase change. Similarly, rotation of a π* MO about the internuclear 
axis will also produce a phase change.
Molecular Orbital (MO) theory
Molecular Orbital (MO) theory allows the determination of molecular structure where electrons are not 
assigned to specific bonds between selected atoms, but are allowed to move within the whole molecule 
as a result of interactions with the atoms’ nuclei. Molecules each have MOs as described above, and any 
electron, of that molecule, may be located anywhere in that molecule. These electrons may by more 
associated with one nuclei than another or be spread fairly uniformly over the molecule in MO theory 
meaning it is useful when considering extended systems.

MO diagrams – It is possible to visually represent the bonding interactions within a molecule using 
molecular orbital (MO) diagrams. Within such representations, horizontal lines denote MOs and the 
higher the line from the base of the diagram, the higher the energy of the orbital. Degenerate (or equal 
energy MOs) are placed at the same height with a small space between each MO line. Once all MOs 
have been added to the diagram, the electrons are added individually, ensuring that the Pauli exclusion 
principle and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity are obeyed such that single electrons are added to 
all MOs in one level before pairing and moving on to the next set of MOs. There are exceptions and 
more complicated systems within such diagrams, but these are not considered here.
Valence bond (VB) theory
Valence bond theory is the idea that a bond forms when two valence electrons, those electrons able to 
take part on bonding, have the role of holding two nuclei together by lowering their relative energies. 
Linus Pauling was influential in the development of this field establishing six key rules for bonding:
1)	 Each atom in the electron pair bond formation contributes one unpaired electron
2)	 These electrons must have opposing spins
3)	 These electrons, once paired, may not participate in any further bond formation(s)
4)	 There is only one wave function per atom involved in the electron exchange terms
5)	 The strongest bonds are formed by electrons in the lowest available energy levels
6)	 Orbitals that can overlap most form the strongest bonds and the bond forms lies in the 
direction of the summative orbital.

The two methods are similar, becoming equivalent once extended, and are essentially both approximations 
of the alternative quantum theory, which is often used to predict the behaviour of molecular species. 
There are marked differences between the two approaches, for example in hypervalent molecules, where 
main group species can have greater than eight electrons in their outer shells, d-orbitals are essentially 
ignored in MO theory, whereas they play a crucial role in VB. Each has its strengths, for example VB 
theory provides a far superior approximation for the hydrogen molecule, and MO theory is more useful 
in predicting molecular spectroscopic, magnetic and ionisation properties. 
Intermolecular interactions
Many bonding interactions and molecular forces can be attributed to a range of intermolecular forces. 
In order increasing strength they are: 
London dispersion forces (0–25 kJmol-1) are the result of the influence of neighbouring atoms on each 
other, as their electron clouds will not be uniform and their orientation with respect to their neighbours 
can induce a non-permanent dipole as a consequence.
Dipole-dipole interactions (0–50 kJmol-1)are the result of dipoles that can be induced on atoms or 
molecules as a result of differences in relative electronegativity of system species or electron transfer, the 
former produce partial charges and the latter give rise to more permanent charges.
Cation-pi interaction (5–80 kJmol-1) is the interaction of a cation, positively charged, and the negatively 
charged electron density associated with an aromatic ring.
Hydrogen bonding (4–120 kJmol-1) is essentially the result of a large difference in electronegativites 
between hydrogen and the atom to which it is bonded, producing a fixed dipole that causes strong 
electrostatic interactions. In water, the interactions between molecules raises the boiling point of water 
above that expected.
Bonding types and characteristics of bonds
The attractions between atoms that allows them to form larger structures, called molecules, are known 
as chemical bonds. These bonds involve electrostatic interactions of varying strengths and can be the 
result of electromagnetic force attractions between formal charges, such as electrons and nuclei, or 
dipole interactions. Chemical bonds vary in strength from strong bonds, such as covalent or ionic 
bonds, to weak bonds, such as dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding or London dispersion 
forces.

Atoms and bonding
In the case of a bond forming as the result of an interaction between formal charges, negatively charged 
electrons will be attracted to positively charged protons in the nucleus. As two atoms participating in a 
bond will each have a nucleus, the electron will be attracted to each, hence, the most stable configuration 
of the three particles is for the electron to spend most of its time between the two nuclei than anywhere 
else in the atom spaces. The result is that the two nuclei are attracted to each other, forming a bond. The 
nuclei do not approach each other to become indistinguishably close as the wave character of the electrons 
means that they occupy a volume far greater than their mass dictates, keeping the nuclei separated. Strong 
bonds are normally associated with such sharing of electrons between atoms and are often covalent 
bonds, known as electron sharing bonds, as the electrons are equally shared in the overlapping electron 
space between the atoms involved in the bond. There is an exception to this in the polar covalent bond, 
where the electrons are shared unequally giving rise to polar characteristics to the bond. Covalently 
bonded species are often Lewis acids and bases (see chapter on Acids and Bases), which can accept or 
donate electron pairs, respectively, such chemistry is important in ligand and chelating applications.
Ionic bonds do not involve sharing of electrons; rather the bonding electron is transferred to one of the 
atoms, which is generally dictated by the electronegativity of the elements involved. Electronegativity is 
the ability of an element to attract electrons to itself, and there are large differences in electronegativity 
between the atoms involved in ionic bonds. Ionic bonds involve at least one atom with an outer orbital 
vacancy that is able to accept the donation of electron from another atom. Often these electrons will 
occupy lower energy orbitals and experience closer interaction with nuclei than in their original atoms, 
allowing transference of the electron to the second atom. The movement of an electron from one atom 
to the other produces a net positive charge on the atom losing the electron, and a net negative charge 
on the atom gaining an electron. The magnitude of the charge can increase with increasing numbers of 
electrons lost or gained. The resulting charged species are known as ions.
There is a final class of bonding called metallic bonds, where electrostatic forces exist between delocalised 
electrons and positively charged metal ions. It is easiest to think of this model as a set of metal cations 
in a ‘sea of electrons’, this gives rise to the conductive nature of many metals. It should be appreciated 
that this type of bonding is over a whole, rather than singular atomistic species.
Bond order – this is related to the number of electrons in bonding and anti-bonding orbitals, such that 
bond order = 0.5 x [(number of electrons in bonding MOs) – (number of electrons in anti-bonding 
MOs). This is due to the fact that the bonding and antibonding electrons cancel each other out and the 
remaining electrons are paired.
Bond length – this is inversely proportional to bond order and represents the distance between the 
nuclei of bonded atoms.

Organising the elements
All substances and materials are composed of one or more of the fundamental states of matter known as 
the elements. There have been many attempts to categorise and group the elements into families of similar 
materials, with the eventual development of the precursor of the current periodic table, as proposed by 
Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Only elements are grouped in the table and this format collects the elements 
into seven periods (the horizontal rows) and 32 groups (the vertical columns) and is a visual version of 
the periodic law, by which elements show periodic repetition of chemical properties in correlation with 
their atomic number. The periodic table, in this format, includes gaps in the horizontal rows to ensure 
chemically similar elements are grouped accordingly. Some of the groups have assigned names, such 
as alkali metals, alkali earth metals, halogens and noble gases. Some periods also have special names, 
including the transition metals, actinides and lanthanides; It is worth noting that most modern periodic 
tables will show only 18 groups, this is due to the removal of the lanthanides and actinides, referred to 
as the f-block, into a separate block of two rows often shown below the main table and unnumbered, 
which allows simplification of the table.

The periodic table
The periodic table of the elements
As the elements are grouped by chemical nature, this allowed the properties of many elements to be 
predicted before the element had even been discovered. The elements up to atomic number 112 have 
been isolated in nature to varying degrees, 91 of these being considered primordial elements, while those 
with atomic number 113 and above have only been produced in the laboratory. The elements are often 
named after those who discovered them or something pertinent to their providence or the discoverer; 
the formal procedure of adopting names for the elements falls to IUPAC (the International Union of 
Pure and Applied Chemistry).
The recurring chemical nature of the elements is ascribed, by quantum mechanical theories, to the 
configuration of electrons within atoms, with each period corresponding to an electron shell. As the 
number of electrons in the shell increases, the periods become longer.
The table shown deals only with the naturally isolated elements. In this modern version of the periodic 
table, all of the known elements are arranged in order of their atomic number, from left to right across 
the periods, Each new period starts with the next atomic number after the last element listed in the 
previous row and there are no gaps or duplication, as the masses given are the average of the atomic 
masses for all known isotopes in their relative proportions. It is worth noting here that the atomic masses 
do not always increase incrementally with atomic number so preceding elements may be lighter than 
their neighbours, due to the numbers of neutrons in the nuclei of isotopes and isotopic proportions.

The periodic table
Periodic table groups
The vertical columns of the periodic table are also called groups and this grouping of elements with similar 
electronic structure is important in predicting reactivity and structure of substances composed of certain 
elements as well as for the elements themselves. Some groups, for example group 8, the noble gases, exhibit 
very similar properties within the group. The groups are numbered 1 through 18 starting from the left-
hand most column. Properties that are exhibit trends within groups are the atomic radii, electronegativities 
and ionisation energies. Descending down a group the atomic radii increases, as a result of the increased 
distance that the outer electrons can be found from the nuclei as more shells are filled with increasing 
atomic number. Again, descending the group, decreases the electronegativity of the elements as the distance 
between the nucleus and outer electrons increases, similarly the ionisation energy decreases moving down 
the group as electrons become easier to remove as a consequence of them being further from the nucleus.
Periodic table periods
The horizontal rows of the periodic table are known as periods, and are much less used to classify trends in 
elements, however, there are groups, such as the transition metals, part of the d-block, where such horizontal 
groupings are useful in describing the expected chemistry of the elements. The lanthanides and actinides are 
two further cases, known as the f-block, which are shown as separate horizontal groups in the periodic table 
above. Ionisation energy also trends within the periods, as may be expected; the value decreases moving 
across the period from left to right as a result of the increasing distance of the outer electrons from the 
nucleus. Other properties trending across periods include atomic radii, usually decreasing as subsequent 
shells fill, and electronegativity, increasing for the same reasons as ionisation energy decreases.
Due to the inherent chemical properties associated with the different sections of the periodic table, 
many people refer to them as the periodic table blocks, and their respective names, and often chemistry, 
is derived from the shell containing their outermost electron(s). Hence, there are four key recognised 
zones, that are named after the outermost electronic shell containing electrons, and these are known as 
the s-block, p-block, d-block and f-block.

The periodic table
Main group elements
The main group elements include those with s and p outershell electrons, i.e. those in the s- and p-blocks. 
These elements are the most abundant in the Earth’s composition and within the Universe, and may also 
be referred to as the representative elements.
Electronic configurations
Electronic configurations can be used to show the occupation of orbitals and subshells for a given element, 
allowing the reader to understand their potential for bonding and reaction. The method use to write 
electronic configurations uses a combination of s, p, d and f notation and numbers.
It is easiest to build up an understanding of how to write electronic configurations by starting with 
the simplest atoms and increasing the level of complexity over a number of elements with sequentially 
increasing electron count. This can be done by starting with the first period of the table.
The first element in the first period is hydrogen, with one electron, which is located in the 1 s orbital 
as this has the lowest energy of all the orbitals. Hence, the electronic configuration is written: 1s1. The 
second element, helium has 2 electrons, again located in the 1s orbital; as the first shell consists of only 
an s orbital coupled with the fact that s orbitals can only accommodate 2 electrons, this completes the 
filling of the first shell. The electronic configuration is hence 1s2.

The periodic table
As the first shell is now full, any additional electrons will need to be accommodated in higher energy 
shells and their orbitals, starting with the second level with progression into the second period. The 
next element is lithium with 3 electrons. The first two fill as for helium, i.e. 1s2, then the third electron 
is located in 2s, as this is the next lowest energy level, hence the electronic configuration is written 1s2 
2s2, note that there are no commas between the shells, nor between orbitals in shells, it is all written as 
one string of text. As you may be aware, each of the noble gases will complete the filling of a shell, hence 
their inert behaviour, so they are often used to assist in simplifying electronic configurations, e.g. 1s2 
2s1 can be rewritten as [He] 2s1, the later noble gases are more often used in this role as writing [He] is 
actually no shorter than writing 1s2 but the point is that this truncation of the electronic configuration 
should be recognised as a shorthand notation commonly used by chemists. Subsequently to lithium, 
beryllium has 4 electrons, hence it will be written as 1s2 2s2 (or [He] 2s2). After this the s orbital is filled 
and all additional electrons will need to be accommodated in higher energy orbitals and shells starting 
with the shell 2, p orbitals.
All 2p orbitals have the same energy, so the electrons occupy all three orbitals singly at first, before 
pairing up, which is energetically less favourable, hence the next three configurations are:
B (5e-):	 1s2 2s2 2px
1	
	
	
or	
	
[He] 2s2 2px
1
C (6e-):	1s2 2s2 2px
1 2py

or

1 2py
1 2pz

or	
	
[He] 2s2 2px
1 2py
1 2pz
1
After the single occupancy of each p orbital, the next three have to pair up in the remaining spaces, hence:
O (5e-):	1s2 2s2 2px
2 2py
1 2pz
1	
	
or	
	
[He] 2s2 2px
2 2py

2 2pz

or	
	
[He] 2s2 2px
2 2py
2 2pz

It is evident that the nomenclature for elements with a significant number of electrons, can be simplified 
using the noble gas notation but these is an additional tool of simplification that can be employed, which 
is to lump all of the p orbital electrons together into one term hence the three configurations above 
would become:
O (5e-):	1s2 2s2 2p4	
	
	
or	
	
[He] 2s2 2p4
F (6e-):	 1s2 2s2 2p5	
	
	
or	
	
[He] 2s2 2p5
N (7e-):	1s2 2s2 2p6	
	
	
or	
	
[He] 2s2 2p6
This is generally how you will see the configuration written for electrons in non-bonding orbitals, as 
often the outermost, bonding, electrons will be written in full with respect to their orbital occupation.

The periodic table
The second shell only has s and p orbitals, hence neon completes the filling of the second shell and 
additional electrons need to be accommodated in higher energy shells, starting with shell 3, and their 
orbitals in the third period. Shell three has s, p and d orbitals, but the order in which they are filled 
becomes more complex after 3p and the order in which orbitals fill is dealt with in the section on 
periodicity. After this point, the pattern of filling becomes repetitious to some extent but take care to 
fill the lower every orbitals first and to fill them completely.
The 3s and 3p orbitals are completely filled for argon, again a noble gas, so its electronic configuration is:
Ar (8e-):	
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3px
2 3py
2 3pz
2	
or	
	
[Ne] 3s2 3p6
It may be expected to start filling the 3d orbitals next but these are actually of higher energy than the 
4s orbital, hence, it fills first followed by the 3d level, hence, the following elements have the assigned 
electronic configurations:
K (19e-):	
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1	
	
or	
	
[Ne] 3s2 3p6 4s1
Ca (20e-):	
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2	
	
or	
	
[Ne] 3s2 3p6 4s2
Sc (21e-):	
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d1 4s2	
or	
	
[Ne] 3s2 3p6 3d1 4s2
Mn (25e-):	
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s2	
or	
	
[Ne] 3s2 3p6 3d5 4s2
Zn (30e-):	
1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2	
or	
	
[Ne] 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2
In contrast to the p orbitals, d level orbital fillings are almost always given as the total number of electrons 
in all d orbitals in that level, e.g. d4 or d9. From the scheme above it can be seen that zinc completes the 
filling of the third level of orbitals, two elements after what would be expected from the filling order 
used previously. It is, therefore, imperative that care is taken over writing electronic configurations, as 
the chemistry of zinc is affected by having complete electron shells. For those with a keener interest in 
the chemistry of the d-block, there is an interesting exception to the neat filling described above, which 
is chromium. Cr should, from the filling order described above, have an electronic configuration of 
1s22s22p63s23p63d44s2 but the 6 electron in the 3d and 4s orbitals rearrange so that each orbital is occupied 
by a single electron, so that it is correct to write: 1s22s22p63s23p63d54s1.
Periodicity and electronic structure
Elements exhibit certain chemical properties as a result of their electronic configuration, which dictates 
bonding, hence, the valence (outer) shell electrons are of particular importance. The valence shell orbital 
type determines the block to which an element belongs. For example, en element with valence electrons 
in d-orbitals will be part of the d-block; this categorising suggests typical chemistry of these elements. 
The period itself is determined by the total number of electron shells an atom has, which are filled in 
an order determined by the Aufbau rule, where lower energy orbitals fill first. The order, for s, p, d and 
f orbital filling is generally:

This gives the periodic table its structure, and defines the number of other shell electrons that an element 
will have, in accordance with its position in a period. For example sodium (Na with 11 electrons arranged 
1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s1) is first in its period and will have one electron in its outer shell (shell 3), while silicon 
(Si, 14 electrons: 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p2) is fourth in the same period and thus has four outer shell electrons 
(again shell 3, with 2 in s and 2 in p). Below this period potassium (K, 19 electrons: 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 
3p6, 4s1) and germanium (Ge, 32 electrons: 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6, 4s2, 3d10, 4p2) will have the same outer 
electron numbers as the elements directly above them (this time in shell 4), and this is where group 
number can be useful, as it gives an idea of the outer shell electron number. The fact that there are 10 
elements in-between is of no consequence, as these elements have electrons in d-orbitals of a shell below 
the outer one (in this case in shell 3), which fill by the time Gallium (Ga) is reached, hence, back to the 
same relationship as for previous periods. Note that when writing out electronic structures, it is possible 
to use shorthand notation of the noble gas configuration, so, for example potassium (K), which has 
already been given as 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6, 4s1, may also be represented as Ar, 4s1. This is because argon 
(Ar) has the electronic structure 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6 so, as this is replicated in potassium’s structure the 
shorthand is to represent all these terms by simply writing Ar.
Oxidation state
This indicates the degree of oxidation of a given atom within a molecule, and the formal number attributed 
would be the theoretical charge if all its bonds to other atoms were ionic bonds. It essentially tells 
chemists how many electrons can be attributed to each atom in a molecule, if all electrons are assigned 
via a set of agreed rules. The values given are normally positive or negative integers between -4 and +8, 
but are occasionally zero (as for pure elements) or fractional. If an atom undergoes reaction and the 
oxidation number is increased, this is known as oxidation, conversely a decrease in oxidation number 
is referred to as reduction of that atom. The change in oxidation number is usually due to net transfer 
of electrons, either a gain or loss per atom. There is a common mnemonic to remember which way this 
occurs: oxidation is loss (of electrons), reduction is gain (of electrons), hence oilrig. It should be noted, 
however, that oxidation and reduction refer to a change in oxidation state and transfer of electrons may 
not actually occur. Hence, it is more correct to define oxidation as an increase in oxidation state, and 
reduction as a decrease in oxidation state. Generally, these changes are caused by a transfer of electrons, 
thus, the accepted definition above.

The periodic table
Oxidation state rules
The rules used to assign oxidation sate are:
1.	 All pure elements have an oxidation sate of 0.
2.	 Simple, monatomic, ions, have an oxidation state equal to the net ion charge.
3.	 The charge of a polyatomic molecule or ion is equal to the sum of the oxidation states of all 
the constituent atoms. This allows unknown values to be determined if the oxidation states 
of all other species are known.
4.	 Hydrogen has oxidation state +1; oxygen has oxidation state -2 in most compounds. 
Exceptions include some metal hydrides, where hydrogen has oxidation state -1 due to the 
electropositivity of the metal, and peroxides, where oxygen has oxidation state -1.
5.	 As fluorine is the most electronegative element, its oxidation state does not change from -1; 
for the other halogens, they also have oxidation state -1, except when bonded to O, N or 
another halogen with greater electronegativity.
6.	 Alkali metals generally have oxidation state +1, while alkaline earth metals generally have 
oxidation state +2.

The periodic table
It is important to note that the formal charge on an atom and its oxidation state in a molecule, may not 
be equal; for example in ammonia (NH3), the formal charge on the nitrogen atom is zero, whereas the 
oxidation state is -3. It may sometimes help to draw a Lewis structure, where the bonded structure is 
represented diagrammatically and valence electrons are shown with bonding electrons assigned to the 
more electronegative element for all atoms, to help with assigning oxidation states. This can be very 
useful if there are inequivalent atoms of the same element in one molecule, such as the two sulphur 
atoms in S2O3
2-, where one sulphur is bonded to the second and three oxygen atoms, this sulphur atom 
has oxidation state +5 whereas the terminal sulphur has an oxidation state of -1.
Transition metals
The transition metals are elements with incomplete d sub-shells, or that form cations with incomplete 
d sub-shells, generally with electronic structures of the form [ ]ns2(n-1)dm, where m represents the 
number of d-shell electrons. These metals often form coloured compounds as a result of d-d electronic 
transitions; they can form compounds in a number of oxidation states and/or paramagnetic compounds.
Redox reactions
In redox reactions, one species is oxidised while another is reduced by the net transfer of electron from 
one to the other. Redox is shorthand for reduction-oxidation. As may be expected the change in the 
oxidation states of the oxidised species must be balanced by any changes in the reduced species. For 
example the reduction of PbS to PbO by oxygen:
PbS + 3/2O2 → PbO + SO2
sees the sulphur lose 6e-, and changing oxidation state from -2 to +4, while each of the three oxygen 
atoms gain 2e-, going from 0 for the elemental form to -2. So the altered species balance each other out, 
it should be noted that Pb does not alter oxidation state (+2).
Within redox reactions, the pair of reactions must always occur, i.e. a reduction reaction must be 
accompanied by an oxidation process, as electrons are transferred from one species to another. Each of the 
singular reactions in this pair is called a half-reaction, in which the electrons lost or gained are included 
explicitly, allowing electron balance to be accounted as well. The two sides of the reaction, given by the 
half reactions, should be balanced accordingly. The additional terminology comes from the definition 
that within redox processes, a reductant transfers electrons to an oxidant, hence, the reductant (reducing 
agent) loses electrons, so is oxidized, while the oxidant (oxidizing agent) gains electrons, so is reduced. 
The reductant and oxidant form a redox pair; this should not be confused with the term redox couple, 
used in electrochemistry, which describes a reducing species and associated oxidised species, e.g. Ag+/Ag.
Each half reaction produces a standard electrode potential (E0) as the cathode in a reaction, relative to 
is a standard hydrogen anode where hydrogen is oxidized: ½ H2 → H+ + e-, under STP. The reducing 
potential of each species is then given relative to this reference.

The periodic table
Redox reactions are industrially important in smelting, where ores are reduced to produce metals, 
electroplating and the manufacture of cleaning products.
Isotopes
Isotopes, a term created by Margaret Todd in 1913 to describe the species observed at the same position 
on the periodic table, are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons but the 
same number of protons. 
Isotope nomenclature
The nomenclature for isotopes is to either i) write the full name of the element followed by a hyphen 
then the mass number of the isotope, for example carbon-12 or carbon-14; or ii) write the chemical 
symbol for the element, in this case C for carbon, with the atomic number of the element as a prefixed 
subscript and the total number of nucleons in the nucleus as a prefixed superscript, e.g.
C
12
6
 or 
C
14
6
. As 
the atomic number denotes the element, which is also represented by the chemical symbol, it is somewhat 
redundant to include and the simplified form is used with nucleon number only, e.g. 12C or 14C. 
Occurrence of isotopes
As mentioned in the previous topic, the number of protons in a nucleus indicates the element being 
studied and the number of neutrons gives the isotope of that element. To illustrate this, consider the case 
of carbon-12 (12C) and the less common isotope carbon-14 (14C) used for radiocarbon dating. 14C has 
a mass number (protons + neutrons) of 14, while 12C had a mass number of 12. As they contain the 
same number of protons, given by the atomic number for carbon, which is 6, this means 14C contains 8 
neutrons while 12C contains 6. Some combinations of these values create stable molecules but each element 
has at least one isotope with an unstable nucleus that will undergo radioactive decay to achieve stability. 
Such decay can result in the loss of protons or neutrons, changing the isotope or even the element itself.
Generally, there are only a few stable isotopes for each element, most commonly 3-4; the element with 
the most stable isotopes is tin, with ten, and there are 26 elements that have only a single stable isotope. 
Once the atomic number increases to 83 and above, there are no stable isotopes for any of these species. 
Isotope stability is related to the ratio of protons and neutrons, and the presence of key numbers of 
nucleons that indicate fully occupied quantum shells can have an influence. This contributes to the 
inherent stability of tin as it has 50 protons, representing a filled shell. It is unusual for stable nuclei to 
include odd numbers of protons and odd numbers of neutrons, and only four examples do: 2H, 6Li, 10B 
and 14N, this is due to the fact that such odd-odd nuclei easily undergo beta decay to the more stable 
even-even product, which is more strongly bonded as a result of the effect of nuclear pairing. Such 
unstable isotopes are also called radioisotopes due to their radioactive decay behaviour; they may also be 
referred to as radionuclides (see below). The total number of stable and radioactive isotopes, including 
those created under laboratory conditions, is in excess of three thousand separate species.

The periodic table
Another term that is often used is nuclide; this is an atom with a nucleus composed of a set number of 
protons and neutrons, for example 14C contains 8 neutrons and 6 protons. Grouping species together 
by nuclear number, called the nuclide concept, places importance on nuclear properties rather than 
chemical properties (the isotope concept). It is important to understand the difference between these 
terms, although they will often be used, erroneously, in place of each other.
Chemical and physical properties
As mentioned above, grouping atoms by the isotope concept collects atoms together in terms of chemical 
character. This is due to the fact that different isotopes of the same element have the same number of 
protons (atomic number) and electrons, giving them similar electronic structure. An exception to this is 
the observation of kinetic isotope effects where the differences in mass between some isotopes of the same 
element cause variations in the behaviour, such as the slowed rate of reaction for heavier species. There is a 
marked effect for hydrogen and deuterium as the additional neutron mass makes a relatively larger difference 
to the mass than for heavier elements, where one more neutron would be a small percentage increase. 
Atomic masses of isotopes
The atomic mass of an element, as can be seen from the periodic table, are not always integers, and this 
is a consequence of isotopic distribution. The mass is an average over the natural abundance of all the 
different naturally occurring isotopes in the ratio that that are present. The average relative atomic mass 
(RAM) for an element with n naturally occurring isotopes, may be calculated using:

Applications
Isotopes are useful in several applications but the separation of individual isotopes for use is still a major 
technical issue, especially for the heavier elements including uranium. For some lighter elements, gas 
diffusion of key compounds can be employed using a physical difference, however, for hydrogen and 
deuterium, chemical separation methods can be used. Heavier elements can be separated into their 
isotopes again by gas diffusion but other separation techniques include gas centrifugation and laser 
ionisation. Analysis of the relative abundances of certain elements in a given sample can be used to detect 
contamination of food and drink samples, as well as identifying meteorites or soil samples.
Providing a pure isotopic sample is available, such species can be used in chemical reactions as tracers or 
markers, which can be monitored using infrared spectroscopy or mass spectrometry; radiative detection 
methods can be employed but only if radioactive isotopes have been employed. Radiometric labelling, 
as it is called, is useful in radiocarbon dating where the relative amount of carbon-14 and the known 
half-life of that isotope are used to determine the date of formation of an artefact. There is significant 
use of radioactive isotopes in the nuclear power industry and in the production of nuclear weapons. The 
use of labels in chemical reactions can also be used to determine the mechanism of reaction through 
the kinetic isotope effect. 
It is not only the difference in masses of isotopes that makes them useful;the fact that some exist with 
zero nuclear spin makes them invaluable in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy. These are usually the less common isotopes of the elements listed in the periodic table and 
nitrogen-15 is an example. The fact that some isotopes undergo specific nuclear transitions is exploited 
in Mőssbauer spectroscopy, which can be used for example to monitor catalyst phase transformations 
in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, used to manufacture hydrocarbons.
Kinetic isotope effect 
This is most often the difference in reaction rate as a ratio of two different isotopes within a chemical 
reaction or process. Altering an isotope within a chemical system, very often replacing deuterium for 
hydrogen, can dramatically affect the reaction rate. If the substituted isotope is involved in the rate 
determining step this is called a primary effect, and secondary effects are observed when the substituted 
group is not part of a bond either broken or formed in the reaction.

The periodic table
The differences in reaction rate upon isotopic substitution is attributed to the difference in vibrational 
frequency of the chemical bond broken or formed. As the vibrational frequencies of chemical bonds 
are affected by the masses of the groups at each end, then the greater the difference in mass of the two 
isotopes used, the greater the kinetic isotope effect observed; this accounts for the common substitution 
of deuterium for hydrogen as the mass is doubled. The change in vibrational frequency alters the strength 
of the bond, which, in turn, alters the activation energy required for bond cleavage, hence the rate of 
breakage. For deuterium, this would increase the mass of the isotope, decreasing the vibrational energy 
of the bond, increasing the activation energy and reducing the rate. Sometimes, the rate of reaction upon 
deuteration is seen to increase and such cases are known to exhibit an inverse kinetic isotope effect.
Radioactive decay
Isotope atoms can often have unstable nuclei, which will try to become stable by the spontaneous emission of 
ionising particles. The process is monatomic, i.e. no other species are required to interact with the decaying 
atom, with the process usually confined to the nucleus of the atom but that may require the capture and 
internal conversion of one of the atoms inner electrons. Once radioactive decay has occurred, it does not 
mean that the nuclide formed, known as a radiogenic nuclide, is stable itself and further decay may occur, 
by a sequence known as chain decay. Within the process the initial nuclide is called the parent and the 
nuclide formed by decay is known as the daughter, due to the nature of radioactive decay, the parent and 
daughter may not be the same element, a process known as nuclear transmutation. Although radioactive 
decay is random on a single atom scale, with the exact moment of decay being unknown, a sufficiently 
large sample of the same nuclide will have a calculable decay profile over any given time.
There are a number of different decay mechanisms, which can affect either or both the mass or atomic 
number, by either increasing or decreasing the value. For example in alpha decay, an alpha particle is 
emitted from the nucleus, reducing the mass number by 4 and decreasing the atomic number by 2. 
Within the decaying system, all mass is conserved, however, as radiation is involved, there is a need to 
re-establish an equilibrium within the system before each particle will achieve its rest mass.
Measuring activity
The radiation emitted by decaying particles is measured using either the S.I. preferred Becquerel (Bq), 
defined as one decay per second, or the Curie (Ci), which is the related to the decay of a specific isotope 
(radium-226) and is equal to 37 GBq. Species with particularly low decay rates may be recorded in 
decays per minute (dcm).
Half-lives – the time taken for half of the radionuclide atoms in a given sample to decay is known as the 
half-life, designated t½, and can be found from the exponential relationship with decay constant (l) using:

The periodic table
The second relationship can be made as the mean lifetime, the average lifetime of a single radionuclide, 
t = 1/l. Hence, it can be seen that a nuclide with a large decay constant has a short half-life. Typical 
decay constants vary from 10-23 to 1026 seconds, showing a large variation in nuclide stability.
Activity – as stated before, the decay of single species is stochastic but the decay of a population of N 
particles will be predictable over a partciular time interval (dt), so the total activity, i.e. the number of 
decays the population will undergo in dt is given by:

Molecular structure
Molecular structure
Molecular structure of simple molecules can be crucial in understanding the reactivity of the compound 
and the potential products from a given reaction. Electronic structure has been discussed previously 
and here consideration is given to the modes and orientation of bonds, which will give rise to the shape 
of each molecule.
Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory
VSEPR theory uses the electrostatic repulsion between electron pairs to predict the shape of molecules, 
as the valence electron pairs that surround each atom in a molecule will mutually repel each other, 
forcing the bonds to orient into an arrangement that minimises the repulsive forces of all bonds. The 
steric number of an atom can help in assessing the shape as it indicates the number of electrons pairs 
for that atom, irrespective of whether the pairs are bonding or non-bonding.
Comparison to other models
In contrast to the bonding models discussed in the Atoms and Bonding chapter, which consider bonding 
orbitals for molecular shape, with the formation of sigma and pi bonds, as in valance bond theory and 
molecular orbital theory, VSEPR is considered rudimentary; although VSEPR often gives accurate 
predictions of molecular geometries for covalently bonded molecules.
Determining molecular structures
As there are many atoms in even the most simple molecules, the theory focuses on considering the bonds 
formed by one or two central atoms, which are themselves bonded to two or more atoms; the geometries 
conferred to these selected atoms provides the shape of the overall molecule. Lewis structures have been 
discussed earlier, and these can be used to determine the number of electron pairs in the valence shell 
of a selected atom; this can be extended to show electron lone pairs and projecting bonds. Double and 
triple bonds are treated as though they contain only one electron pair. Where a molecule has two or 
more resonance forms, VSEPR can be applied to any of the structures. 
As each atom is considered to be a sphere, the bonds coming from the atom can orient themselves 
anywhere over the surface, producing a full three dimensional geometry for that atom. An easy example to 
begin with is carbon dioxide, which has two oxygen atoms bonded to one carbon atom, via two separate 
bonds; each C=O bond experiences the lowest repulsion from the other when they are diametrically 
positioned, and the molecule is linear, as below:

Molecular structure
linear molecular geometry
Extension to three electron pairs, sees the atoms bonded to the central atom, adopt the vertices of an 
equilateral triangle around the selected atom, as in a trigonal geometry. 
trigonal pyramidal geometry
Four electron pairs moves the arrangement from two dimensions and the geometry becomes tetrahedral, 
with each of the connecting atoms adopting the vertices of a trigonal pyramid (an equilateral triangle, 
with all three points meeting at a fourth point in the space above) around the selected atom. 
tetrahedral geometry
The geometry can be affected by whether the electron pair is shared with another atom in a bond, or if 
it is a lone pair, which will be held more strongly to the central atom. The lone pairs, therefore, exert a 
greater repulsive force than bonding pairs, reducing the angle between bonding pairs:

Molecular structure
Lone pairs will most strongly repel other lone pairs, while bonding pair-bonding pair repulsions are 
weakest, with mixed repulsions somewhere in-between, hence, the lone pairs repelled by other lone pairs 
will tend to occupy the sites of least repulsive force. An example of the importance of inequivalent sites 
in structure is the five electron pair arrangement of trigonal bipyramidal (imagine two trigonal pyramids 
glued together on one face). Here, the three sites in the same plane have the same repulsion, which is 
less than that felt by the two sites out of the plane.

Molecular structure
The existence of lone pairs, occupying given sites in a molecular geometry, can also explain the differences 
in shapes of molecules with equal numbers of atoms, for example CO2 is linear, as all the electrons are 
involved in two bonding pairs, however, SO2 is ‘bent’, as there are two bonding pairs and one lone pair 
on the central sulphur atom; the three bonds adopt a trigonal arrangement, but there are only connecting 
atoms on two bonds, ideally the bonds should be 120° apart but the lone pair repulsion to the bonding 
pairs will cause a contraction in the angle between the two oxygen atom bonds. It also explains the 
structure of ammonia, NH3, which should be trigonal, but the lone pair of electrons from the nitrogen 
forces the geometry to be tetrahedral with the lone pair making the fourth point.
tetrahedral geometry with one lone pair of electrons on A
For water, there are four pairs, hence the structure should be trigonal pyramidal, however, there are 
two lone pairs and two bonding pairs, hence the geometry adopted will again be bent and the bond 
will be smaller than the 109.5° expected for the trigonal pyramid, at only 104.5°, as the lone pairs exert 
greater repulsion on the bonding pairs. Hence, the description of a ‘bent’ molecule is based purely  
on the orientation of the atoms in the molecule, not the overall electronic arrangement within the 
molecule.
tetrahedral geometry with two lone pairs of electrons on A
Predicting molecular geometries
The steric number of an atom, A, in conjunction with information on the number of bonding (B) and 
lone (L) pairs in a molecule allow the structure to be predicted, and the table below shows the geometries 
expected for the simple steric arrangements most often encountered.

When different substituents (B) are present in the molecule, the predicted geometry is generally still

Exceptions to VSEPR
As with most rules, there are exceptions to VSEPR, where the model fails to predict the geometry correctly; 
one such category of molecules is transition metal compounds. The main reasons for this failure are the 
fact that there are no valence shell lone pairs and d-shell electrons will interact with ligands within the 
system. The geometries of such compounds can often be predicted by either VALBOND theory, which 
is based on valence bond theory and considers sd hybrid orbitals and the three centre/four electron 
bonding model, or crystal field theory, which takes the degeneracies of electronic orbital (usually d or 
f) states, caused by an inherent charge distribution from neighbouring atoms, into consideration.

Mass and volume
Mass and volume
Chemical engineers have to design individual process units, i.e. reactors, distillation columns, heat 
exchangers, supervise the operation of a process or modify the design to accommodate changes in 
feed. So within process systems, chemical engineers monitor and control the flow of mass and energy 
within each unit. Considering mass in this case, it is most commonly controlled through mass, molar 
or volumetric flowrates and a key skill is to be able to work within all three sets of units and convert 
easily betweem them. Chemical engineers must be comfortable quantifying compositions, amounts and 
conditions of materials that enter and leave a process unit, requiring definitions that are recognised as 
the technical chemical engineering language.
Mass
The language associated with mass is a significant issue, hence, it is important to understand the nomenclature 
used and appreciate its usage. The resistance of an object to its change in velocity is a quantitative definition 
of mass, and it is commonly accepted that inertial mass, which determines an objects acceleration in the 
presence of any applied force (recall a = F/m), active gravitational mass and passive gravitational mass 
are all equal quantities. It is, however, essential to differentiate between mass and matter, as all matter has 
mass but mass is not solely attributable to types of matter, as many types of energy also exhibit mass, for 
example kinetic or potential energy, and photons in electromagnetic radiation.

Mass and volume
Many people use mass and weight as the same term and weight is often quoted in mass terms, e.g. 
kilograms, when this should really be Newtons as weight is mass multiplied by gravitational force. This 
is an incorrect interchange and should be avoided in scientific working, due to the fact that, at zero 
gravitational force, weight can be zero but mass can never be zero.
Within a given system, mass conservation must be obeyed over any time period as mass cannot be 
created nor destroyed. As it has been mentioned that some energies have a mass associated with them, 
it is sometimes necessary to incorporate an energy term into a mass balance to make it valid.
Volume
The amount of three dimensional space enclosed by a closed system, for example the space occupied by 
a gas in a container, is known as the volume of the system. The units most commonly used for volume 
are the derived units of litre (L) or cubic metre, from length cubed. The unknown volume of a given 
solid, of any shape, can be found by fluid displacement, this method can also be used to determine the 
volume of some gases but caution is required as gases often dissolve in the fluid and the total volume of 
the combined system is not additive.
Mass and Volume
Mass and volume are related by density, which is defined as mass per unit volume with units including 
kg/m3, lb/ft3 etc. Density is a useful quantity as it is independent of temperature for solids and liquids. 
Chemical engineers also use the term specific volume, which is volume per unit mass and measured in 
m3/kg, ft3/lb etc. It should be evident that specific volume is the inverse of density.
The density of a substance can be used as a conversion factor to relate the mass and volume of a quantity 
of substance via:
mass = volume x ρ
where ρ (rho) is the symbol for density.
Mass and Volumetric Flowrate
In continuous chemical processes material will move from one point to another, sometimes between 
process units; hence a static mass or volume measurement is of little use. The rate at which material is 
transported is called a flowrate and can be expressed as mass flowrate (mass per unit time, e.g. kg/hr) 
or volumetric flowrate (volume per unit time e.g. m3/hr).
Mass and volumetric flowrates are related through density, in a similar fashion to the static system:
mass flowrate = volumetric flowrate x ρ

Mass and volume
In industry it is frequently easier to measure volumetric flowrate. Therefore the mass flowrate is commonly 
calculated from the volumetric flowrate and the density of the stream fluid.
Within calculations it is usual to use a symbol with a dot above it e.g. 
•
m to denote a flowrate of that 
parameter, this symbol would indicate a mass flowrate.
Mass and Mole Units
Two of the first skills required by a chemical engineer are to be able to express compositions and to 
be able to convert between mass and mole units. For this, consider the periodic table, met previously, 
this allows us to understand determine the mass of a standard amount of material, known as the mole 
(discussed in the next topic). By being able to determine molar quantities from masses, chemical engineers 
can calculate many physical parameters for a given system.

The mole
The mole 
The Periodic Table was described earlier, and represents all the known elements, grouped according to 
chemical properties. The table displays information about all the elements including their relative atomic 
mass, which is a critical quantity in the concept of the mole.
The mole
Considering the reaction that would occur between elements to form molecules, it is easy to see that 
specific numbers of building blocks are required to react with each other to create these larger structures. 
So starting with the Periodic Table and atomic masses, it was decided in the 1960s, after several other 
models were dismissed, that the concept of a mole as a unit of measurement of the amount of a material 
would be based on the number of atoms that compose 12 g of isotope Carbon-12. Within this mass there 
are 6.02214179 x 1023 atoms, which is referred to as Avogadro’s number (NA). Avogadro first suggested 
that the number of molecules in a set volume of gas, at fixed temperature and pressure, is the same 
regardless of the gas, hence, the constant used today is closely related to this hypothesis and bears his 
name. The value of 6.02214179 x 1023 atoms is the number of atoms in one mole.
Atomic mass unit (amu) and atomic weight
A single 12C atom, at rest, is assigned a mass of 12 atomic mass units (amu) so, as carbon-12 contains 
6 protons and 6 neutrons in the nucleus, 1 amu is approximately the average mass of proton/neutron. 
Given 1 atom of 12C will weigh 12 g/(6.02214179 x 1023) = 1.9926 x 10-23 g, which is also 12 amu, hence, 
1 amu has a mass of 1.6605 x 10-27 kg.
This forms the basis of all the atomic masses observed in the Periodic Table, 12C has 6 protons and 6 
neutrons, so has an atomic weight of 12, similarly 42Ca has 20 protons and 22 neutrons, so an atomic 
weight of 42 (such calculations are typically correct to < 1%). The masses used for each element are 
normally the average mass taken as the proportions of their naturally occurring isotopes. So, for instance, 
chlorine has an atomic weight of ~35.45, as a result of it being about three quarter 35Cl and one quarter 
37Cl in its natural abundance. The molecular weight of a substance is found from the sun of the atomic 
weights of all the individual components constituting a molecule of the compound.
The individual masses of atoms are too small to work with directly; hence, chemists use the concept of 
the mole and scale the mass of an element by a given number of particles (NA) such that a mole always 
contains the same number of elementary species.

The mole
Units of the mole
As with the units met previously there are many ways of representing the unit of measurement of the amount 
of material, the most commonly use of which is the ‘gram mole’. This is a mass in grams that is numerically 
equal to the molecular weight and is used to convert between mass and mole units. The same definition 
holds for other units of mole, but the mass units must also be carefully considered. These alternate units 
include kg-mole (kmol), lb-mol and ton-mol and each has its mass unit defined in its name. Consider the 
example of CO, which has a molecular weight of 28, so the molar quantities would be one g-mole (mole) 
of CO contains 28 g, one kg-mol (kmol) contains 28 kg and one lb-mol contains 28 lb. It is rare to see 
g-mole and kg-mole used in their expanded nomenclature and, most often, mole and kmol will be used.
From the example above it should be appreciated that if the molecular weight of a substance is M, then 
there are M kg/kmol, M g/mol and M lb/lb-mol. This is useful information as molecular weight can be 
used as a conversion factor between mass and mole:
 weight
molecular
mass
 
 
mole =
Mass and molar conversion – as a consequence of the relationship between molar quantities, it follows 
that mass conversion factors are equal to molar conversion factors. So in the way that:
1 kg = 1000 g = 2.205 lb
So does		
	
	
 1 kmol = 1000 mol = 2.205 lb-mol
Mass and mole fraction – often a process stream will contain more than one substance, and it is necessary 
to be able to determine the contributions of each species to the mixture. The following terms are used 
to define the composition of a mixture:
mass fraction, 
mass

mass
A
x

and	
 mole fraction,

When using these values or determining them, it is essential to choose a valid basis for the calculation 
so if data is provided in terms of mass (e.g. % mass) then a basis of 100g could be chosen; if data is 
provided in terms of moles (e.g. % by moles) then a basis of 100 moles would be most suitable.
Average molecular weight – this represents the average mass of one mole of a gas mixture and can be 
calculated using:

Stoichiometry
Stoichiometry
The mole is a useful quantity in determining the amount of material that is present in a system or that 
might be required in a reaction. When considering chemical reactions, the ratio of each species required 
to take part in the reaction can be one of the most important pieces of information. It allows a chemical 
engineer to determine how much material is required or, more importantly, the minimum amount of 
a cheaper reagent that they can supply to maximise the conversion of a more expensive substance. The 
ratios required for each element or molecule are known as the stoichiometry of the reaction.
Stoichiometry
Stoichiometry is the theory of the proportions in which chemical species combine with one another. 
The use of the concept of the mole is vital when dealing with chemical reactions. For example, consider 
the following reaction:
CH4 + 2O2  CO2 + 2H2O
The chemical equation is balanced, i.e. there is the same number of each atom type of the left and right 
hand sides of the reaction. The balanced equation shows the relative number of moles (or molecules) of 
reactants and products involved in the chemical reaction, indicating the stoichiometry of the reaction. 
The numbers written before the species in the chemical reaction are called the stoichiometric coefficients.

Stoichiometry
When performing stoichiometric calculations, remember that these are only valid on a molar basis, so 
convert all mass quantities provided to moles, this allows the others quantities to be determined by the 
use of ratios and multiples. It is always possible to convert the number of moles back to a mass at the 
end, if this is desired. When working with molar quantities ensure that any molar units are consistent 
throughout the calculation e.g. lb-mol, kmol, mol, any can be used but must be maintained in working. 
In such calculations, total mass must be conserved, i.e. the total masses in and out of the system must 
tally, and it must be borne in mind that a balanced reaction is no proof of a feasible reaction, which 
must be determined thermodynamically. Similarly, there is no information regarding the rate at which 
the reaction will proceed, the degree of completion that will be achieved or the possibility of unwanted 
side reactions.
Molar flowrate
In many processes, there will not be a static system but a flowing process stream, so the molecular weight 
is used to relate the mass flowrate of a continuous stream to the molar flowrate:
molar flowrate, 
 weight
molecular
flowrate
 
mass
nf =
It should be clear that this now provides an easy route to convert volumetric flowrates into molar 
quantities, but using the methods outlived in mass and volume.
Industrial considerations
Exact stoichiometric amounts are rarely used in industrial processes and companies often increase the 
conversion of an expensive reactant, by adding other reactants in excessive quantities. This means that 
the product streams will also commonly contain these excess reactants. Such methods can be used to 
prevent unexpected side-reactions that can also occur, limiting conversion to the desired product. The 
conversion can also be increased by recycling key feeds, this can affect the equilibrium of a system and 
drive the reaction toward further production of desirable products.

Acid-base chemistry
Acid-base chemistry
Definition of acids and bases
The chemical interaction between an acid and a base is known as an acid-base reaction, which varies 
depending on the species involved. Historically, the theory of acid-base chemistry was thought to be 
related to the composition of the compound, specifically that it should contain oxygen; this was the theory 
of Antoine Lavoisier but was disproved some years later by Sir Humphry Davy when he proved non-
oxygen containing species, such as hydrogen sulphide and the hydrohalic acids, existed. This work was 
extended by Liebig, who proposed that acids are substances that contain hydrogen that can be displaced 
by a metal species before being formulated into the currently accepted Arrhenius definition of a acid as 
a substance that dissociates in water to produce hydrogen cations (H+), while a base dissociates in water 
to form hydroxide anions (OH‑). It should be appreciated that H+ ions do not exist as separate species 
in a solution but rather that the hydronium cation (H3O+) is actually formed.
This forms the basis of the statement that the reaction of an acid and a base will produce a salt and water 
in a neutralisation reaction, as the hydrogen cations form a compound (water) with the anion from the 
base (i.e. hydroxide anion) and the cation from the base, often a metal, will react with the anion from 
the acid to form a salt. For example the reaction of potassium hydroxide and nitric acid:
H2NO3 + 2KOH → K2NO3 + 2H2O
 acid + base → salt + water
Note that the Arrhenius definition only holds for aqueous systems and that the dissolution of acids in 
other solvents would not necessarily be acidic, similarly molten metal hydroxides are not basic. The issue 
of the solvent used was resolved with the generalisation offered by the solvent system theory, devised 
by Albert Germann. He noted that in several solvents, there is a presence of solvonium cations and 
solvate anions in equilibrium (see chapter on equilibria for more information) with undissociated solvent 
molecules. The simplest example is water itself, which exists as water with some hydronium cations and 
hydroxide anions. The addition of another substance, i.e. a solute, to the solvent causes a shift in this 
equilibrium to form either more solvonium cations or solvate anions, depending on its nature. An acid 
increases the solvonium cations present, while a base increases the concentration of solvent anions. For 
example, water exists as:
	
	
2xH2O ↔ xH3O+ + xOH−
Addition of the acid H2NO3 will form more hydronium cations:
	
	
2xH2O + yH2NO3 ↔ (x+2y)H3O+ + yNO3
- + xOH−	
	
(x → 0)

Acid-base chemistry
While the presence of the base KOH will increase the presence of hydroxide anions:
	
	
2xH2O + zKOH ↔ xH3O+ + zK+ +(x+z)OH−	
	
(x → 0)
The strength of this approach, in terms of solvent rather than only water, is demonstrated by consideration 
of aprotic solvents, such as liquid N2O4:
AgNO3 + NOCl → AgCl + N2O4
 base + acid → salt + solvent
As a result of the interaction between the basic/acidic species and the solvent, the nature of a substance 
can be altered by changing the solvent for example perchloric acid, which is a strong acid in water, is a 
weak acid in ethanoic acid yet a weak base in fluorosulphonic acid. This approach has been criticised 
but it is important to appreciate the changing nature of compounds with regard to their environment, 
which can have consequences for reaction and materials choice.
Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases
Working independently, Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Martin Lowry developed a definition, 
underpinned by the concept of base protonation and acid deprotonation, where acids have the ability 
to donate hydrogen cations (H+) to bases, hence the acids accept these H+ ions. This definition removes 
the reliance on a full system description, i.e. the solvent or salt formed, but rather focuses on the acid 
and base themselves. The species involved in the transfer of a proton are known as a conjugates (i.e. a 
pair), with a conjugate acid and conjugate base produced. 
By this definition, i.e. acids donate protons and bases accept them, an acid-base reaction is, therefore, 
the transfer of a hydrogen cation from an acid to a base. Thus the acid and base react, not to given a salt 
and solvent, but rather a new (conjugate) acid, the base with accepted H+, and new (conjugate) base, the 
acid with H+ removed; consequently eliminating the idea of neutralisation.
For example, the addition of hydrogen cations (H+) to hydroxide anions (OH−), which are basic, produces 
water (H2O); hence water is the conjugate acid of hydroxide ions:
H+ + OH− → H2O
As mentioned above, the solvent is no longer considered, however, the solvent system can co-exist within 
the Brønsted-Lowry definition, which can also provide an explanation for the low concentrations of 
hydronium and hydroxide ions produced by the dissociation of water:
2H2O ↔ H3O+ + OH−

Acid-base chemistry
where water, which is amphoteric, acts as both acid and base; as one molecule of water donates a H+ 
ion, forming the conjugate base, OH−, with a second molecule of water accepting the H+ ion, forming 
the conjugate acid, H3O+.
In general, for acid–base reactions, the Brønsted–Lowry definition is:
AH + B → BH+ + A−
where AH is the acid, B is the base, BH+ is conjugate acid of B, and A− is the conjugate base of AH.
Lewis acids and bases
In contrast to the Brønsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases, Lewis defined the species in terms of 
electron transfer rather than hydrogen cations. Hence, a Lewis base is a species that donates an electron 
pair to a Lewis acid, which accepts the donated electron pair. This concept is most easily demonstrated 
by considering the established aqueous acid-base reaction:
HCl + NaOH → H2O + NaCl

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Acid-base chemistry
Here the acid combines with the base, rather than exchanging atoms with it; the acid is H+ and the base 
OH−, which has an unshared electron pair that it is able to donate, Hence, the acid- base reaction is not 
the transfer of H+ but the donation of an electron pair from OH−, forming a covalent bond to produce 
water. The electronic interactions involved are the donation of electrons from the highest occupied 
molecular orbital (HOMO) of the subsequently known base to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
(LUMO) of the second species, then known as the acid.
The strength of a Lewis acid and base interaction is determined by the concentrations of all solution 
species, for a simple system:
A + B ↔ AB
The stability constant is given by:
[
]
[ ][ ]



<=
 
where a high value of K indicates a strong interaction as [AB] is large compared to the product of [A]
[B]; similarly a low value of K indicates a weak interaction. The interactions is usually governed by the 
relative strengths of the acid and base, which can be either hard or soft.
Hard acids and bases are usually small species that are difficult to polarise, e.g. hard acids: H+, Na+, 
Al3+; hard bases: OH−, F−, NH3. In contrast, soft acids and bases are usually large species that are easily 
polarised, e.g. soft acids: Ag+, Cd2+, Cu+; soft bases: H−, I−, CO. This is an important distinction as hard 
acids tend to bind to hard bases, as they both exhibit high ionic character so K is high, and soft acids 
tend to bind to soft bases, which both exhibit significant covalent character and, again, K is high. Any 
soft-hard interaction will have a low K as the interaction will be poor.
Reactions of acids and alkalis
This is a particular acid-base reaction, where the base is also an alkali species, meaning it is a basic, 
ionic salt of either an alkali or alkaline earth metal. In this instance, the reaction produces a metal salt 
and water in a neutralisation reaction. The acid either contains hydrogen cations or causes them to be 
produced in solution, while the alkali is a soluble base either containing hydroxide ions or causing them 
to be produced in solution. For example, nitric acid and potassium hydroxide: 
HNO3 → H+ 
(aq) + NO3
− 
(aq)
NaOH → Na+ 
(aq) + OH− 
(aq)
As a result of the neutralisation of either the acid or base, by the other species, into water, such reactions 
have a number of applications including within antacid formulations, where excess hydrochloric acid 
in the stomach is neutralised, most commonly, by species including sodium carbonate and aluminium 
hydroxide. Neutralisation can also be used for the regulation of pH in agriculture via the application of 
fertilisers, or the abatement of acid formation by the removal of sulphur from fuel before combustion 
to avoid the formation of sulphur dioxide, and, subsequently, acid rain.

Acid-base chemistry
Acid-base titrations
The most commonly used laboratory method for the determination of an unknown analyte, i.e. the 
species of interest, is called a titration and this is very often utilized in acid-base chemistry. The 
technique is a quantitative, mostly, volumetric analysis. A standard solution titrant of either the acid or 
base is prepared, with a known concentration, and the volume of this solution required to react with a 
given amount of the analyte determines its concentration. An indicator is routinely used to determine 
the end-point of the titration where a lasting colour is either removed or produced at the end-point. 
Such indicators that are often encountered include methyl violet 10B (low pH: yellow; high pH: violet); 
bromophenol blue (low pH: yellow; high pH: purple); methyl orange (low pH: red; high pH: yellow); 
methyl red (low pH: red; high pH: yellow); phenolphthalein (low pH: colourless; high pH: magenta). 
Universal indicator can indicate pH over the whole range but is merely a mixture of several indicators 
that act across the spectrum.
Complexometric titrations
It is common for complexometric titrations to be used in systems involving metal salts, where the 
formation of a coloured complex indicates the end point of the titration, as it can differentiate between 
different metal ions; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is often used as a titrant, acting as a Lewis 
base by electron donation from the four carboxyl and two amine groups. A suitable indicator, that 
produces an unambiguous colour change, is used to determine the titration end-point; these are generally 
organic dyes, such as Eriochrome black T.
Redox titrations
Within these systems there is a redox reaction that occurs between the analyte and titrant, which are 
generally followed using a redox indicator (and/or a potentiometer).A commonly encountered example 
is the titration of iodine against a reducing agent, with a starch indicator, where the dark blue colour 
of the complex formed between starch and iodine diminishes as the iodine is used up by the analyte. 
pH
The acidity (or basicity) of an aqueous system is measured by the pH. A pH of 7 is neutral, neither acid 
or base, and pure water is generally accepted to have a neutral pH at STP. pH values less than 7 are 
considered acidic and greater than 7 is said to be basic (or alkaline). The measure is an approximation 
of -log10[H], where [H] represents the concentration of hydronium cations in the solution; hence a low 
concentration, i.e. more basic conditions, will give a high pH, similarly an acidic solution has low pH. 
This is only an approximate relationship as pH also takes an activity factor into consideration, which 
accounts for the propensity of the hydronium cations to interact with other species within the solution 
so more correctly pH should be written as -log10(aH+), where aH+ is the activity of hydrogen ions in mol 
L-1. Generally, most pH values lie between 1 and 14 but there are actually no upper or lower limits on 
the relationship, hence, values outside of this range may be observed.

Acid-base chemistry
Activity is defined as the product of a concentration and the activity coefficient, which usually takes any 
value between 0 and 1, hence it is less than the concentration but similarly measured in mol L-1. The 
activity is affected by the ion type, temperature and ion charge so for a strong electrolyte, the activity 
tends towards the concentration in a dilute solution. 
pH is determined using a pH meter, which relates potential difference to (aH+), hence pH, using the 
Nernst equation:

where E is a measured potential of the solution, measured in volts (V) which are equal to J C-1, E0 is the 
standard electrode potential (often using a calomel electrode, and in the standard state for which the 
activity is one), R is the gas constant (8.3144 J K-1 mol-1), T is the temperature in Kelvin, F is the Faraday 
constant (C mol-1), and n is the number of electrons transferred. By using solutions of known activity, 
is possible to deconvolute this from and determine the concentration independently. 
pOH
Similarly to pH, pOH is often used to measure hydroxide ion (OH−) concentration, however, pOH 
is not an independent measurement, but is derived from pH. Hydroxide ion concentration, in water, 
is related to hydrogen ion concentration through the self-ionization constant of water (KW, which is 
approximately 10-14) by:

[OH−] = KW /[H+]
Hence	 	
	
	
	
pOH = pKW − pH
As a consequence pOH ≈ 14 – pH, at room temperature but this relationship is not always valid.
Strong acids and bases
Acids and bases are often referred to in terms of strength and it is useful to understand what is meant 
by the terms strong and weak in this context. Strong acids and bases are those that essentially dissociate 
(ionize) completely in water, for example hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and sodium hydroxide is 
a strong base. When calculating the pH of a strong acid, the baseline concentration contribution from 
the ionisation of water is negligible, hence, the pH is essentially a function of the concentration. This 
contrasts to weak acids, where dissociation of the acid is small and the baseline contribution from water 
is significant, within a weak acid system, as for all equilibrium states, mass balance must be obeyed so 
any acid dissociated is present as the conjugate base anion, hence, the relationship
Ca = [HA] + [A-]
holds, where [HA] is the concentration of the protonated form of the acid, and [A–] is the concentration 
of the conjugate base anion, and Ca is constant. It should be appreciated that for a strong acid, [A–] will 
be much greater than [HA], so the [HA] term can be neglected, hence:
Ca = [A-]
Within the aqueous solution it is necessary that charge neutrality is maintained, known as the 
electroneutrality principle, across all species combined.
Weak acids and bases
In this class of compounds, there are added complications from the additional species present as a result 
of only partial dissociation, using the dissociation constant for the system under study; hence, for a 
weak acid either pKa or Ka (acid dissociation constant) is used. Ka is related to the concentrations of all 
the species involved by:

Acid-base chemistry
When pH is considered to be less than 6, except in the case of extremely weak acids or infinitely dilute 
solutions, [H+] can be assumed to be much greater than [OH–], which allows simplification of the above 
relationship, by [H+] = [A-].
Applications
Within chemical engineering, it is possible to work with a wide range of pHs in the same process, with 
chemicals like ammonia (pH 11) and hydrochloric acid (pH 1), both concentration dependent, exhibiting 
extremes of the range. However, the use of raw chemicals is not the only time this may be encountered, 
in food processing and pharmaceuticals manufacture high and low pHs are common, for example fruit 
juice (pH 2-3) or milk of magnesia (pH 10).
Water is a variable quantity and, when using it as a material or amenity, it is worth considering the 
altered properties depending on its origin. Distilled water, as mentioned above, is essentially neutral 
with pH7; however, seawater is slightly basic (pH 8) while mine runoff water can even exhibit negative 
pHs (up to pH -3).

Basic organic chemistry
Basic organic chemistry
The field of organic chemistry is vast and much work is dedicated to understanding reactions in such 
systems in great detail to optimize processes and develop new molecules. As a chemical engineer, it will 
often be necessary to scale-up the manufacture of new substances or to work with chemists to improve 
existing processes. To this end it is essential that chemical engineers understand the language used by 
chemists and have a basic understanding of the factors controlling basic organic chemistry.
Basic nomenclature
Nomenclature is the term used to define the naming procedure of a given system. Chemical nomenclature 
may sometimes appear unintelligible but, by following the basic rules laid out here, it should be possible 
to work out the molecules that are being discussed.
One of the most important underpinning pieces of information in chemical nomenclature are the root 
names for organic chains. The names are approved by IUPAC meaning that they are globally recognised 
and the main root chain given in chemical compound name relates to the longest continuous chain of 
carbon atoms, which contain the highest priority functional group (see later).
These names need to be remembered and describe chains up to and including 20 carbon atoms, but 
here only chains up to and including 10 carbon atoms will be discussed and this should be the most 
complex examples encountered.

Within organic systems, each carbon atom is able to make four bonds to other atoms, including other 
carbons, which should be remembered when determining structures. Several different types of simple 
molecules exist:

Basic organic chemistry
Alkanes – known as saturated hydrocarbons, these molecules only contain single bonds between the 
carbon atoms and no multiple bonds. The bonding consists of four sigma bonds and is known as sp3 
hybridised, as the four electrons from the four bonding orbitals are shared in one s and 3 p orbitals. 
The beginning of their name comes from the root name and they end in –ane (from their family name 
of alkane); the formula of alkanes follow the rule CnH2n+2. Hence, a chain of length 6, would be hex- 
plus –ane: hexane and have formula C6H14.
As a straight chain molecule, the structure would be:
 stick and ball representation
line drawing
 
hexane
Molecules can be depicted in a variety of ways and two of these representations are shown above. The 
stick and ball version shows all atoms as colour coded balls with the bonds between them represented 
by sticks. The line drawing simplifies the arrangement as it only shows the carbon atoms and the 
connectivity between them; hydrogen atoms are ignored. Similar methods can be used for any molecule 
but the colour of the atom will change, depending on what it is, and any element other than carbon, or 
hydrogen which is omitted, will be designated by the use of its elemental symbol in place of the intersect 
of two or more lines, as used for carbon.
Some chemists may even represent chemical reactions, especially those involving organic reagents, as 
a series of line drawings, which can be used to indicate the movement of atoms within the structures 
that are reacting. Often, the chemist will use arrows to indicate the loss of a group or the movement of 
electrons within a structure. Such diagrams with notation are referred to as reaction mechanisms.
Branched alkanes – an alkane with an additional, shorter chain, coming off the longest section, is known 
as branched but other than that has the same bonding characteristics and generic formula as an alkane. 
As a result of the existence of branched molecules, several molecules can have the same formula but 
very different structures, these are known as isomers. An example is C5H12, which has three isomers. 
The first isomer is the 5 carbon chain of pentane:

pentane
The second has the same formula (C5H12) but the carbons are bonded in a different way, giving 2-methyl-
butane, as there is a four carbon chain with a methyl group attached to the second carbon:
 
2-methyl-butane
Lastly, the third isomer is known as 2,2-dimethyl-propane, as there is a three carbon chain with two 
methyl groups attached to the second carbon:
 
2,2-dimethyl-propane

Basic organic chemistry
This last isomer raises another issue in naming molecules, that of multiples of the same substituent, in 
this case there are two methyl groups so it is convenient to group these into one term of dimethyl. The 
2,2 denotes that the two groups are both bonded to carbon 2. When grouping substituents the prefixes 
to use are:

Shorter groups are listed first, before the longer parent chain name i.e. as in the example above, 
2,2-dimethyl-propane, the methyl groups are given first in the name. The groups are listed alphabetically 
in a molecule name rather than by carbon chain length, i.e. ethyl- would be listed before methyl-.

Basic organic chemistry
Cycloalkanes – these are formed by a carbon chain closing by bonding to itself at some point. An example 
is cyclopentane, which has five carbon atoms in a ring, the cylco- part denoting a ring is formed and 
pentane indicating it is an unsaturated chain of five carbon atoms. It is worth noting that the rule of 
listing shorter groups first is still true and care is required when substituents are longer that the parent 
chain forming the ring. For example compare, propyl-cyclopentane and cyclopropyl-pentane:
propyl-cyclopentane
cyclopropyl-pentane
A result of the presence of the rigid and fixed structures of cyclic species is the presence of steric isomers, 
where the orientation of a substituent depends on specific bond direction formed during reaction. So the 
arrangement of the atoms is the same but their position in space is different. An example would be1,2-
dimethylcyclopropane, where the two methyl groups can both be on the same side of the ring or opposite:
trans-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane
cis-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane
Hence, there are two different versions of the same molecule, with the same substituent placement, which 
are only differentiated by the prefixes trans- and cis-, indicating different or the same side of the ring, 
respectively, see the pictures above.
Functional groups – within organic chemistry, there are a number of additional groups of elements that 
need to be understood and recognised, as their presence can greatly affect a reaction pathway. This is 
particularly important when species that are ‘good leaving groups’ are present, for example the halides, 
as they are very electronegative, The presence of such groups can be intentional, in order to drive a 
reaction at a particular part of the molecule. Again, there is some related nomenclature for functional 
groups, which can occur in many different types of organic molecules. In the table below, there are 
several prefixes/suffixes that tell the reader of functional groups that are contained in a molecule. These 
are a small selection of a wider variety in use.

In the table above R denotes a carbon chain connected to the functional group, and X is a generic halide. 
Alkanes are known as aliphatics, alkenes also fit into this category.
Alkenes – in contrast to alkanes, the alkene family are unsaturated species and have at least two carbon 
atoms within the structure that form only three bonds instead of four; at least one bond is a double bond 
between two carbon atoms and these three coordinate carbon atoms are referred to as sp2 hybridised, 
consisting of two sigma and one pi orbitals. The beginning of their name comes from the root name 
and they end in –ene (from their family name of alkene); the formula of basic alkenes with only one 
double bond follow the rule CnH2n. Hence, a chain of length 6, would be hex- plus –ene: hexene and 
have formula C6H12.
As a straight chain molecule, the structure would be:

It should be evident that the double bond can be present in more than one position in this molecule 
and its location has to be defined in the name. The example above would be known as 2-hexene, as the 
number is given by the first carbon of the double bond.
For multiple double bonds, the formula rules are: CnH2n for one double bond (d.b.), CnH2n-2 for 2 d.b., 
CnH2n-4 for 3 d.b. and so on. The number of bonds present is also denoted in the name using the same 
multiple terms as for substituent group numbering, an example would be a chain of six carbons with 
two double bonds:
 
2,4-hexadiene
Note that the two double bonds occur consecutively in the molecule, such bonds are called conjugated 
bonds, which allow some delocalisation of the electrons in these bonds, which affects their chemistry.

As is the case for alkanes, branched alkenes are also known and their treatment and naming is the same 
as for their saturated counterparts, and isomers may be formed. As the double bonds cannot rotate as 
single bonds can, then the formation of cis and trans isomers is also possible. These analogies are also 
true of cyclic alkene species.
Alkynes – are another category of unsaturated structures and have at least two carbon atoms within 
the structure that form only two bonds instead of the four seen in alkanes; at least one bond is a triple 
bond between two carbon atoms and these two coordinate carbon atoms are referred to as sp hybridised, 
consisting of one sigma and two pi orbitals. The beginning of their name comes from the root name and 
they end in –yne (from their family name of alkyne); the formula of basic alkynes with only one triple 
bond follow the rule CnH2n-2. Hence, a chain of length 6, would be hex- plus –yne: hexyne and have 
formula C6H10. The location of the triple bond must be given in the name of the alkyne.
 
2-hexyne
Aromaticity – cyclic species were met earlier and can exist for alkanes, alkenes and alkynes, the concept 
of conjugation was also discussed and the existence of conjugated cyclic species leads on to aromaticity. 
Compounds that are aromatic, are fully conjugated cyclic (or even polycyclic) structures with a number 
of double bonds. Conjugation of the sp2 hybridised occurs by the overlap of the pi orbitals of the carbon 
atoms and results in an inherent stability of these compounds, and reducing their relative reactivity 
compared with the equivalent alkene. The bonds are all planar and the electrons involved in the sp2 bonds 
form a delocalised ring, containing (4n+2)π electrons, where n is an integer, for example benzene has 18 
electrons and n = 4. This is known as Huckel’s rule and this relationship must be obeyed for aromatic 
compounds. The simplest aromatic system is benzene (C6H6, full name: 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene), which 
can be drawn as:

It should be noted that the line drawing has other equivalents:
↔ 
↔ 
The third representation indicating that the π electrons are delocalised across all carbons, hence the 
location of the double bonds is not fixed. The bond ‘order’ for benzene is 18e-/6 bonds = 1.5, which is a 
better representation of the structure than considering it as alternating single and double bonds.
Polycyclic aromatics are common and are composed of multiple benzene rings, for example naphthalene, 
which is the primary ingredient of mothballs:
 
↔
naphthalene (bicyclo[4.4.0]deca-1,3,5,7,9-pentene)
[4.4.0] indicates the carbon atoms in each part adjoining the interconnected section, i.e. 4 carbon atoms on 
each side and no additional carbons between the joining points, which may be known as the bridgehead 
carbons. The numbering is always given in descending order.
The name aromatic indicates the pungent odours of these substances. These mono- and polycyclic 
aromatic species can be substituted in the same manner as the alkanes etc. Another separate family of 
aromatics that need to be considered are the heterocyclic aromatics, which, by virtue of the inclusion of 
an element different to carbon into part of the ring, can have differences in electronegativity within the 
structure, affecting the reactivity. 
Examples include furan, a 5-membered ring including oxygen and pyridine, a 6-membered ring including 
nitrogen. Some of these species make use of a lone pair of electrons from the heteroatom to contribute 
to the pi electron cloud.

Basic organic chemistry
Stereochemistry – the formation of cis and trans isomers was discussed earlier and understanding the 
meaning of these terms can be essential in ensuring the correct raw materials are sourced or products 
made. Stereoisomers, or configurational isomers as they are sometimes known, have the same molecular 
formulae bonded in the same way but with the atoms occupying different locations in space. With the 
examples encountered previously, the direction of the bond was indicated by the line used, solid wedges 
indicating above the plane, dashed wedge below and solid lines in the plane of the page. cis and trans 
indicate the relationship of the groups to each other for simple alkenes with only two substituted groups, 
but it is also possible to indicate the stereochemistry of the atoms involved in these different orientations 
and to resolve issues of increased complexity.
There are two main methods used, known as the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, depending on whether 
two molecules are geometric or configurational isomers. As stated, each stereogenic centre, previously 
known as a chiral centre, is assigned a letter to indicate the relative position of its substituents with 
relation to their relative priority, based on atomic number. After assigning priority to all substituents, 
hold the molecule so that the lowest priority group points away from you and look at the direction of 
motion with respect to highest to lowest priority for the remaining three groups. The letter R indicates 
a clockwise rotation from highest to lowest priority (from the Latin word rectus meaning right) and S 
(from the Latin word sinister for left) means an anti-clockwise rotation.
cis and trans denotation works for simple linear chains but this no longer works if there are two groups 
attached at either end of a double bond, i.e. four substitutions. For this situation, consider each carbon 
in the double bond separately. Assign the priorities of high and low to each pair of substituents, and then 
determine whether both low priority groups are on the same or different sides of the double bond. If they 
are on the same side, this is called a Z-alkene (from the German word zusammen meaning together); if 
they are on different sides, this is called an E-alkene (from the German word entgegen meaning opposite). 
The position of the centre assigned is given numerically e.g. (2Z,4R)-2-amino-4-chloro-2-pentene:
Cl
NH2
Note that numbering starts at the right hand of the molecule, moving towards the left.
Organic acids and bases
Organic molecules can often act as weak acids or bases, donating or accepting protons, respectively. An 
example of an organic weak acid is ethanoic acid and a weak base would be ammonia. They are weak 
in strength as their ionization is very incomplete. The strengths are given, quantitatively, by pKa and pkb 
values for acids and bases, respectively, and the smaller the number the stronger the acid/base. In both 
cases the strength is related to the stability of the ion formed by proton loss or acceptance. For acids, the 
strength of the bond broken influences the value and for bases it is the ease with which the hydrogen 
ion is picked up by, for example, a lone pair.

Main reaction types
Within organic chemistry there are several main reaction types, which are outlined below:
Addition reactions occur when two molecules combine to form another, larger molecule, and this involves 
at least one molecule with a multiple bond or unsaturated heteroatom. An example is the addition of 
hydrogen, called hydrogenation, of ethane to ethane:
 
 
ĺ 
+ 
Elimination processes involve the removal of two substituents from a molecule in either a one (E2) or 2 
(E1) step reaction. An example is the removal of water, called dehydration, from ethanol to produce ethane:
 
 
 ĺ 
+ 
When a functional group in a chemical structure is replaced by another, different functional group, this is 
known as a substitution reaction. Classification can be made depending on whether the species bringing 
about the substitution is an electrophile (electron loving), either a positively charged species or a Lewis 
acid, or nucleophile, (nuclear loving) an electron-pair donor or Lewis base, as well as considering whether 
the intermediate species formed is a carbocation, a cation containing a positively charged carbon atom 
(C+), carbanion, an anion containing a negatively charged carbon atom with an unshared electron pair 
(C-), or free radical. The type of reaction is also affected by the type of reactant, i.e. aliphatic or aromatic. 
Within nucleophilic substitution reactions there are two mechanistic variants, these being unimolecular 
nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2). SN1 reactions involve 
two steps, where part of the molecule is displaced and a carbocation is formed, before the nucleophilic 
reagent reacts with the carbocation intermediate to form the reaction product, resulting in either inversion 
of configuration at the carbon centre or retention of the original configuration. The second reaction type, 
SN2, has one step, with reagent attack of the carbon centre and ejection of the leaving group happening 
simultaneously. As a result of these concurrent process, SN2 reactions always result in configuration 
inversion. When an aromatic substrate is involved in the reaction, it is known as nucleophilic aromatic 
substitution. Electrophilic substitution reactions are often associated with aromatic systems; however, 
for aromatics other than arenes, the reactions are more generally electrophilic addition.

The configuration of a molecule may also be altered by a rearrangement reaction, where the carbon 
skeleton rearranges to form one of its structural isomers, often involving the transition of a substituent 
group from one molecule in the skeleton to its neighbour in an intramolecular rearrangement. 
Rearrangements can also occur intermolecularly. The movement of electrons in such transfers is not 
easily represented by traditional mechanistic drawings and is more likely a fluid transfer of electrons as 
opposed to the discrete nature inferred by the usual ‘curly arrows’ methods.

Basic thermodynamics
Basic thermodynamics
There are several basic terms that should be defined and understood before reading further about 
thermodynamic processes and variables; these include enthalpy, energy, internal energy, work and 
entropy.
Work
The work performed by a physical system is equal to the energy transferred to another physical system. 
This work can be mechanical, chemical, electromagnetic, gravitational or electrical but not heat, as this 
is treated separately in thermodynamics and both should be considered in energy transfer calculations 
although not both may be involved.
Energy
This is a scalar physical quantity, often defined as the ability of a physical system to do work on another 
physical system. Recall that work is the action of a force across a distance, energy is the ability to apply 
work vectors that act against natural forces.
Energy is measured in joules in the S.I. system, and the energy within a system cannot be created or 
destroyed but can be transformed from one form to another, according to the principle of conservation 
of energy (see first law of thermodynamics). It is noteworthy that the total energy of a system does not 
alter with time, only transfer, the value s only every relative to the reference state used. Energy is often 
stored in systems as matter, kinetic, electromagnetic or potential energy. Matter can be converted to 
energy and energy can be transferred by the transfer of matter, if an energy transfer occurs that is not 
due to matter transfer, then the receiving system changes as a result of work done on it as a result of 
the transfer. There is a limit to the efficiency of energy conversion between different forms (see second 
law of thermodynamics).
Internal energy
This is the total energy within a physical system, being the energy required to create the system but 
excluding the energy required to displace the systems environment, energy associated with a move or as 
a result of external forces. The internal energy is composed of contributions from kinetic and potential 
energy, and its value can be altered by heating the system or work done on the system, see first law of 
thermodynamics.
Internal energy is a state function and independent of path or process. It is measured in the S.I. unit of 
joules.

Chemistry for Chemical Engineers

Basic thermodynamics
Enthalpy
This measures the total energy of a physical system, including internal energy and the energy needed 
to accommodate the system by displacement of the surrounding environment and forming the systems 
volume and pressure.
Enthalpy is a state function and the S.I. unit of measurement is the joule. It simplifies energy transfer 
descriptions, so is often used to describe changes in system energies as it also accounts for transfer to the 
environment, being the result of all non-mechanical work done on or by the system and any heat transfer.
Entropy
The entropy of a system quantifies the energy within the system that is unavailable for work in a 
thermodynamic process. Within some processes, such as energy conversion, which has a maximum 
efficiency, entropy accumulates within the system and is dissipated as waste heat.
It is a quantity that always remains constant or increases in an isolated system, as defined by the second 
law of thermodynamics, which provides an indication of whether a process is entropically favoured. As 
this quantity represents the spontaneous flow of heat from higher to lower temperature regions, hence, 
indicating the disorder within a system. As a result of this heat flux character, entropy is measured in 
joules per Kelvin in the S.I. system.
Zeroth law of thermodynamics
The zeroth law is a generalization of the principle that thermal equilibration exists within a number 
of bodies, or thermodynamic systems, that are in contact with each other. Thermal equilibrium exists 
when bodies or systems do not exchange heat. Thus, any two bodies (or systems) that are in thermal 
equilibrium with a third body (or system) must therefore be in equilibrium with each other. This implies 
that their temperatures are equal.
First law of thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics is basically the principle of the conservation of energy, stating that 
energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one state of another. Within 
thermodynamics, it is considered that the change in internal energy of a system offsets the heat supplied 
to a system minus the work performed by the system on its surroundings. The law is developed from 
original statements made by Clausius, which initially presented the idea in terms of cyclic systems and 
then to internal energy, of processes that did not necessarily need to be cyclic, which is still the form 
used today. The law can be written as:
dU = dQ – dW
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

Chemistry for Chemical Engineers
69 
Basic thermodynamics
where dU is the change in internal energy; dQ and dW are the minuscule amounts of heat supplied to 
the system and work done by the system on its surroundings, respectively. It is worthy of note that many 
textbooks will have the sign in the above relationship as +, this is due to their consideration of dW as 
the work done on the system by its surroundings, and is the convention adopted by IUPAC. Also note 
that an exact differential is only used for internal energy as it is a state function i.e. independent of path, 
whereas the inexact functions used for work and heat are related to that fact they are dependent on 
the path taken to the final point. The expansion of an almost unchanging system, known as quasistatic, 
where any thermodynamic processes occur infinitely slowly, has a work function equal to the product 
of pressure (P) and volume change (dV), hence the change in internal energy becomes:
dU = dQ – PdV
It is worth noting that the functions of work and heat are energy changes that add or subtract energy 
from a system, whereas the internal energy is a property of the system, accounting for any energy 
exchanges performed on the system. This means that the same internal energy value can be determined 
for a variety of work and heat combinations.
The thermodynamic changes to a system, in terms of the first law of thermodynamics, can be divided 
into cumulative sections that are described as either adiabatic or isothermal diabatic.

Basic thermodynamics
Adiabatic processes are those that are thermally insulated, hence, any work exerted adiabatically on a 
given system results in the same final state of the system irrespective of how the work was performed, 
for example chemically, mechanically, electrically etc. This can be summarized as one of the statements 
resulting from the first law of thermodynamics: “for all adiabatic processes between two specified states of 
a closed system, the net work done is the same regardless of the nature of the closed system and the details 
of the process.’’
This implies that internal energy is a state function, i.e. it is independent of the path taken to reach a 
particular point. As a result the internal energy changes from the initial reference point as a result of 
the work done:
ܷ஺ൌܷ଴൅οܹ଴՜஺
௔ௗ
where, the adiabatic work done on the system from 0 to A is given by 
ad
A
W →
∆
0
. Following IUPAC 
convention we take as positive the work done on the system. As the reference state of U will be the 
same for any number of final states in the given system, it is possible to take a path from point A to 
point B, through the reference point, as the state function U will be independent of path taken, hence, 
the change in internal energy will be:
οܹ஺՜஻
௔ௗൌοܹ஺՜଴
௔ௗ൅οܹ଴՜஻

               ൌെοܹ଴՜஺

௔ௗ 
               ൌെܷ஺൅ܷ஻ൌοܷ
Diabatic processes have related heat transfer components, as the non-adiabatic work done on the system 
is not equal to the change in internal energy change, and this must be taken into consideration in the 
balance of the system, as:
οܹ௡௢௡ି௔ௗ്οܷ
Any diabatic change occurring at a constant temperature is known as isothermal diabatic, so the heat 
term will be at constant temperature (ΔQiso) and this allows an adiabatic work function to be used in 
the determination of the internal energy, hence:
οܷൌοܹ௔ௗ൅οܳ௜௦௢
From this expression, it can be seen that the result of doing no work on a system that is thermally 
isolated results in zero change in ΔU, hence, the statement that ‘the internal energy of an isolated system 
remains constant.’

Basic thermodynamics
As mentioned previously, inexact differentials were used for the small amounts of heat and work within 
the system, however, it is possible to rewrite the equality with exact differentials by considering that work 
done, for reversible processes, is equal to the product of pressure (P) and the change in volume (dV), 
and that heat supplied is the product of temperature and the change in entropy, hence:
ܷ݀ൌܶ݀ܵ൅ܸܲ݀
The variables for which changes are measured or determined, i.e. volume, entropy and internal energy, are 
all state functions, hence, the derived equality, known as the fundamental thermodynamic relationship, 
is also true for non-reversible processes.
Second law of thermodynamics
Over an extended period of time, any differences in process variables, such as temperature, pressure 
and chemical potential, will equilibrate in an isolated system, this includes entropic terms and a system 
will tend to increase its entropy where possible, giving rise to irreversible processes. The second law of 
thermodynamics has several different versions:
The Clausius statement says that ‘no process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a 
body of lower temperature to a body of higher temperature’ meaning that heat cannot flow from cold to 
hot regions without the use of external work.
The Kelvin statement says that ‘no process is possible in which the sole result is the absorption of heat from a 
reservoir and its complete conversion into work’, which means that in the process of extracting heat energy 
from a high temperature source of energy with the aim to convert all the energy to work, some heat is lost.
The principle of Carathéodory states that ‘in every neighbourhood of any state S of an adiabatically isolated 
system there are states inaccessible from S’, leading to the derivation of entropy and an initial insight into 
adiabatic accessibility, essentially defining a process as adiabatic if it exhibits a vanishingly infinitesimally 
small heat change over a given time.
Free energy
Any physical reacting system, at standard temperature and pressure, will aim to reduce its free energy, 
which is all the energy contained in a thermodynamic system that can be converted to work. This can 
be determined via either Helmholtz or Gibbs free energy.
Helmholtz free energy
A measure of the useful work that can be obtained from a physical system, at constant volume and 
temperature, is given by the negative of the Helmholtz free energy; the value reaching a minimum at 
equilibrium. The quantity is denoted by the letter A and is measured in joules in the S.I. system. Helmholtz 
energy is related to the internal energy (U), temperature (T) and entropy (S), and defined as:
A = U − TS
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

Chemistry for Chemical Engineers
72 
Basic thermodynamics
Gibbs free energy
This is a measure of the useful, non-mechanical, work that can be obtained from a physical system, at 
constant pressure and temperature, the maximum free energy being obtained for a reversible process. 
ΔG is minimised at system equilibrium, hence, allowing it to be used as an indicator of spontaneity 
for chemical reactions from this state. Gibbs free energy can be defined with respect to enthalpy (H), 
temperature (T) and entropy (S) as:
S
T
H
G
∆
−
∆
=
∆
Where a negative value of ΔG implies that ΔS ≥ 0, hence, spontaneity is expected.
It should be noted that the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energy expressions deal with internal energy and 
enthalpy, respectively, making the Gibbs free energy function more useful to chemical engineers.

Kinetic theory of gases
Kinetic theory of gases
In order to understand the kinetic theory of gases, it is essential to appreciate the terminology of the 
area and the underlying dynamics of the different phases of matter.
Solids
Within a solid material, the molecules are in very close proximity, contacting each other; the only 
permissible motion is that of vibration. The arrangement of molecules can be regular or random. In a 
regular system, the solid can be termed as crystalline depending on the length scale under study; for 
random packings, the solid is usually termed amorphous. These arrangements are held in place by 
interactions between the molecules, which can be a bond (ionic, covalent, metallic) or an electrostatic 
interaction (hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces).
Liquids
In liquid systems, the molecules again contact but there will be occasional spaces in the structure; these 
spaces allow molecule movement through the system and a random arrangement results. Similar forces 
exist as in solid systems but the energy of the molecules themselves have more energy and are, hence, 
able to overcome these forces preventing a fixed arrangement. Generally, as a result of these spaces in 
the structure, the density of the liquid is a little less than that of the solid (water is a notable exception 
to this as solid ice floats on liquid water).
Gases
For gas systems, molecules have large, 10s of molecule scale, distances between them and are free to 
move. At usual temperatures and pressures, the intermolecular forces are practically negligible.
Phase changes
Solid to Liquid
If a heat is supplied to a solid, the vibrational energy will increase, allowing the molecules sufficient energy 
to adopt a less rigid arrangement and become a liquid, through a process known as melting. A specific 
amount of heat is required to convert one mole of a solid into a liquid and this is equal to the enthalpy 
of fusion. An inverse enthalpy of the same magnitude is evolved when a liquid becomes a solid, in the 
process of freezing, as the energy of the molecules reduces enough to allow the attractive interactions 
to arrange and bind the molecules into a solid form. The application of heat breaks the bonds within a 
system, and the formation of bonds, increasing order within the system, generates heat.

Kinetic theory of gases
Liquid to gas
If sufficiently more heat is supplied to a liquid, this causes the molecules to increase their motion and 
relative speed, eventually breaking all the attractive forces binding them into a liquid form and producing 
a gas as the liquid boils. The inverse process is called condensation as the gas molecules reduce their 
energy sufficiently to condense into a liquid. The heat involved in the liquid-gas phase transition is called 
the enthalpy of vaporisation. Occasionally, some solid species form a gas on heating (or the reverse gas 
to solid on cooling), bypassing the phase of liquid, in a process called sublimation; the associated heat 
is known as the enthalpy of sublimation.
Once the molecules are in the gas phase, any increase in temperature translates into an increase in the thermal 
motion of the molecules themselves, hence, their average energy increases. In all systems, irrespective of 
phase, the caveat average is applied to physical parameters as that is exactly what is happening within the 
system. A plot of number of molecules against a given physical parameter will also show a distribution across 
the range and the easiest quantity to report is the average of this distribution. This means that some of the 
molecules will have less energy than the average whilst a proportion will have a greater energy. Within a 
liquid, this means that some molecules at the liquid-gas interface have a greater energy than the bulk liquid, 
which allows them to evaporate into the gas phase. Note that evaporation occurs at the interface between 
the two phases, not from the bulk liquid, as with boiling and the energy that escapes with the evaporating 
molecules is regained from the system surroundings. If the liquid-gas system is contained within a closed 
chamber, then the same process as above would occur at the liquid-gas interface, with evaporation of the 
liquid, at the interface into the gas phase, however, this time there is a similar reverse process that occurs 
where the gas molecules move within the container, interacting with the liquid surface at times, and some 
of the gas phase species with a low energy (compared to the average) will be insufficiently energetic to leave 
the surface again, condensing back into the liquid phase. The two processes continue and at some point 
the number of liquid molecules evaporating equals the number of gas molecules condensing, equilibrium 
is established within the system, where both process rates are equal. As with all equilibriums, this is a 
dynamic system and can be affected by a change in one of the system parameters.
Once equilibrium is established, at a set temperature, there will be a set number of molecules in the gas 
phase at any given point in time. These molecules will move within the chamber, striking the walls of 
the chamber and exerting a pressure, known as the saturated vapour pressure of the liquid. This pressure 
is temperature dependent.
Energy in chemical reactions
Before a chemical reaction can take place intra-molecular bonds of the reacting species must be broken and 
energy must be supplied to break these bonds. As discussed above, molecules within a system each have 
an energy associated with them. This energy is made up of contributions from several forms including: 
electric, chemical, thermal, vibrational, rotational and translational (kinetic) energy. The total energy of 
all the molecules in a system can be represented by the Maxwell-Boltzmann relationship, which is a law 
expressing the energy distribution among molecules at thermal equilibrium:

In a reacting system, when the reactants collide energy is released and if energy is sufficient the bonds

as the Activation Energy, EA, which is a fixed quantity, independent of temperature. The proportion 
of molecules with enough energy to react, governed by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, rises 
exponentially with increasing temperature, explaining why a modest change in temperature results in 
a large change in reactivity.

Kinetic theory of gases
Kinetic energy
Also known as translational energy, the kinetic energy of a molecule is the energy it possesses as a result 
of its motion. It is the energy required to accelerate the mass of the molecule from rest to the given 
speed, more correctly termed velocity as it is directional, hence a vector not scalar quantity. After being 
accelerated to the given velocity, the molecule maintains its kinetic energy till it changes velocity, which 
can, of course, mean the speed is maintained by the direction changes; any change in velocity results in 
a net gain or loss of energy to the molecule. Kinetic energy is relative within any given reference-frame 
for example a speeding car has kinetic energy relative to a stationary bystander but zero kinetic energy 
to an observer travelling at the same velocity. The kinetic energy of a molecule is given by:
2
mv
2
1
=
kin
E
Rotational energy
Also known as the angular kinetic energy of a molecule, the rotational energy is the kinetic energy 
resulting from the rotation of the molecule, and contributes to the total kinetic energy of the molecule. 
The rotational energy can be related to the moment of inertia (I) around the axis of rotation by:
2
I
2
1 ω
=
rot
E
where ω is the angular velocity. It is worth noting the similarity between the relationship for kinetic and 
rotational energies.
Vibrational energy
In a molecule with constant translational and rotational motion, the periodic motion of the atoms 
constituting the molecule is known as a vibration, each vibrational periodicity having a specific frequency. 
Generally, a molecule with N atoms has 3N – 6 normal vibrational modes (a linear molecule would not 
demonstrate an observable rotation about its molecular axis, hence in such cases it reduces to 3N-5, and 
diatomic molecules have only one normal vibrational mode due to symmetry). The vibrational modes 
can be excited when a molecule absorbs a quantum of energy that corresponds to the frequency of the 
vibration (v). The energy required is given by:
E = hν

where h is Planck’s constant, 6.6261×10−34 J s. Adsorption of one quantum of energy, by a molecule in the 
ground, i.e. non-excited, state, excites a fundamental vibration. Adsorption of successive quanta of energy 
excite increasingly higher overtones of the molecular vibrations. The relationship between the amounts 
of energy required for successive vibrations to be excited is often approximated one additional quantum 
per overtone, as per the molecular vibrations obeying a simple harmonic model, however, vibration are 
actually anharmonic, meaning that successively less energy is required with each increasing overtone 
vibration after the fundamental. Eventually, sufficient energy will be adsorbed to dissociate the molecule.
The excitation of a vibrational mode results in an associated relaxation of the molecule back to its ground 
state by the emission of radiation, often in the visible or near-visible spectrum. As a result it is often 
easy to directly probe molecular vibrational transitions using spectroscopic methods, such as infrared 
(IR) or Raman. 
IR spectroscopy requires a change in dipole for the molecule under study, a permanent dipole is not 
required merely a change in dipole moment. This is not necessary for Raman, For simple diatomics, there 
is only one bond, hence, one vibrational band. If the molecule is symmetrical, for example oxygen, there 
will be no change in dipole, so the vibration will be Raman, but not IR, active. In contrast, asymmetric 
diatomics, for example NO, are IR active. As the number of atoms, hence bonds, increases in a molecule, 
there will be an associated increase in the number of vibrational bands observed in the IR spectra and 
the complexity increases. Modes of vibration can include symmetric, asymmetric, stretching, rocking, 
scissoring, twisting and wagging.
Rotational energy
In addition to vibrational excitation of a molecule, giving rise to vibrational spectra, it is also possible to 
excite rotational modes within a molecule. Rotational modes arise from the symmetry present within a 
molecule, and rotationally active molecules must possess a dipole, such that there is either a difference in 
the centre of mass and the centre of charge for the molecule, or a separation of different charges on the 
same molecule. Spectroscopic methods studying rotational excitation only involve the use of microwave 
radiation and are confined to gases, which have quantised rotational excitations, as emissions are masked 
by collisions within solid and liquid systems. Gas molecules, such as diatomics, which have no inherent 
dipole can have induced dipoles as the result of excitation allowing spectra to be determined for those 
excited species.
Vibrational and rotational excitations usually occur concurrently within a molecule to give the vibration-
rotation spectra, again usually obtained via either Raman or IR spectroscopy. As rotational transitions 
are weaker than vibrational transition, the former is often observed as fine structure on the latter. Such 
spectra can be useful in the determination of isotopic presence and abundances.

The Gas Laws
The ideal gas law is essential to understanding the relationship between the key parameters of a gaseous 
system; the equation is underpinned by several other gas laws and students should have an appreciation 
of these as often their relatively simplistic relationships between parameters can be more useful than 
the full ideal gas law.
Boyle’s Law (1661) – ‘for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature, the volume of the gas is inversely 
proportional to the pressure’, which means that, for instance, a doubling of the volume of a system, with 
all other variables than volume constant, would halve the volume of the gas. This is expressed as:
P ∞ 1/V 
at fixed n and T
So
P·V = constant
Hence
P1·V1 = P2·V2

Physical properties of gases
This relationship should make sense by considering the case above. A container of volume V containing a 
set pressure of gas is increased in size to 2V, the gas molecules that were striking the walls of the container 
(V) produced pressure P as a result. As the volume increases (2V), the gas molecules will strike the walls 
of the container less frequently, as they have further to travel, meaning the pressure is reduced i.e. there 
is an inverse relationship where an increase in one parameter elicits a decrease in the other.
Charles’ Law (1787) – ‘for a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume of the gas is directly 
proportional to the Kelvin temperature’, which means that, for instance, a doubling of the temperature, 
in Kelvin, with all other variables than volume constant, would double the volume of the gas as well. 
This is expressed as:
V ∞ T  at fixed n and P
So
V/T = constant
V1/T1 = V2/T2
It is important to remember that the temperature must be expressed in Kelvin.
This relationship is easy to comprehend, if one considers a fixed mass of gas in a container that has a 
zero-resistance moveable partition, for example a syringe. The barrier will adopt a position where the 
internal and external pressures are equal. Applying a temperature increase to the gas in the container (but 
not the external gas) will increase the speed of the molecules in the container, causing then to strike the 
partition more often, increasing the pressure; this will move the partition to a new position where the 
internal and external pressures are again equal. This movement will increase the volume of the system 
in response to an increase in temperature, and volume is proportional to temperature i.e. an increase in 
one parameter elicits an increase in the other.
Avogadro’s Principle (1811) – builds on the Gay-Lussac Law of 1809 and states that ‘the volume of a 
gas is directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature and mass of gas, and inversely proportional to the 
pressure’. This combines both relationships from Boyle and Charles into one expression, including the 
number of moles of gas in the system. This is expressed as:
V ∞ n·T/P 
So
V·P/n·T = constant
P1·V1/n1·T1 = P2·V2/n2·T2
As for Charles’ Law, it is important to remember that the temperature must be expressed in Kelvin. The 
constant that exists for this relationship is equal to R, the gas constant.

Physical properties of gases
The Ideal Gas Law
The average molecular weight of a gas was met previously, and is useful when dealing with gas mixtures, 
enabling the number of moles to be calculated, hence, relating the behaviour of a gas mixture in terms 
of pressure, temperature and volume through the ‘Ideal Gas Law’.
Experimentally it was found, as stated in Avogadro’s Principle above, that:
ܲή ܸן ݊ή ܶ
The constant of proportionality is R, the Universal Gas Constant, and has several values depending on 
units, the most commonly used are 8.31415 J K-1 mol-1 or 0.082057 L atm K-1 mol-1. Using the constant 
with all the other gas parameters gives the Ideal Gas Law:
ܲή ܸൌ݊ή ܴή ܶ
Where P is the pressure (N m-2), V is the volume (m3), n is the number of moles (mol), R is the Universal 
Gas Constant (J mol-1 K-1) and T is the temperature (K). The Ideal Gas Law is the starting point for many 
applications and is derived from kinetic theory (see later)
From the Ideal Gas Law, it is important for chemical engineers to remember that for a fixed pressure 
and temperature the volume of a gas is proportional to the number of moles of the gas. This is useful 
when converting compositions between volume and molar bases.
The Ideal Gas Law is an equation of state, meaning it is dependent on the state of the species involved, not 
the route taken to attain the final state of the system, and describes the relationship between a quantity of 
gas and pressure, volume and temperature. From this relationship, it can be determined that, at standard 
temperature (273 K/0 ºC) and pressure (1.01325 x 105 N m-2), 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 litres.
Molar flowrate and the Ideal Gas Law
Similarly to the way mass and volumetric flowrates were related previously, it is also possible to relate 
volumetric and molar flowrates, using the Ideal Gas Law. In a completely analogous equation:
ܸܲሶൌ݊ሶܴܶ
Where P is the pressure (N m-2), 
•
V is the volumetric flowrate (m3 hr-1), 
•
n  is the molar flowrate (mol  hr- 1), 
R is the Universal Gas Constant (J mol-1 K-1) and T is the temperature (K). As mentioned previously, in 
chemical engineering volumetric flowrates are used extensively and the relationship between it and area 
or volume can allow the calculation of stream velocity, as:
volumetric flowrate (m3 s-1) = velocity (m s-1) x area (m2)

Physical properties of gases
Mixtures of gases
An important aspect of gas mixtures is understanding the contribution of each component to the 
mix, this may be in considering air as a feedstock or mixed gas feeds to processes such as the Haber 
process, where ammonia is synthesized from nitrogen and hydrogen. The method of dealing with such 
multicomponent streams is by representing the contribution by a partial pressure for each gas species, 
this is underpinned by Dalton’s law, which states that, for a mixture of perfect gases, the total pressure 
(Ptotal) of a given mixture is equal to the sum of the individual pressures (Pi) that each component alone 
would exert in the same container under the same conditions. Hence:

+

The law is also applicable to real gases at low pressures where they exhibit ideal gas behaviour, but will 
be applicable in many cases that may be encountered during chemical engineering studies. For any gas, 
either perfect or real, in a mixture, the partial pressure (Pi) of the gas i would be given by: 
total
i
i
P
x
P =
where xi is the mole fraction of gas i within the gas mixture. The mole fraction can be found from the 
ratio of the number of moles of species i (ni) compared to the total moles of gas (ntotal) within the system, 
so that, the unitless mole fraction is given by:
total
i
i
n

x =
It is useful to note that the sum of all the mole fractions within a closed system should, from the nature 
of their derivation, equal 1, i.e. the total system.

Equilibria and kinetics
Equilibria and kinetics
There are two key pieces of information that chemical engineers wish to determine about any reactive 
system, firstly the final composition of the reaction mixture when the system has reached a stable point 
known as equilibrium and the time it will take to reach this point; these can be determined using 
chemical equilibrium thermodynamics and chemical kinetics, respectively.
Equilibrium
Equilibrium is a dynamic state reached when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions, in a 
reversible reaction, are equal i.e. rate of product formation is equal to rate of destruction. At first, when 
only reactants are present in the system, there will be a fast rate of product formation and a slow rate 
of product destruction, as little product exists. Once the product concentration increases, so will the 
reverse reaction returning products to reactants. Hence, the forward reaction will tend to a limiting rate 
of reaction from a maximum and the reverse reaction will tend towards the same limiting rate of reaction 
from a minimum. When the two rates are equal, the maximum point of completion of the reaction at 
particular pressure and temperature has been established i.e. equilibrium; this point is quantified by the 
equilibrium constant, K. If the value of K is very large, the reaction is said to go to completion.

Equilibria and kinetics
Reaction kinetics
This determines at what rate the reaction will proceed towards the maximum extent. There are two main 
reasons for studying rates of reaction, to be able to predict how quickly a reaction mixture will move 
to its equilibrium state and understanding the rate of reaction can reveal the mechanism of a reaction. 
The rate of reaction can depend on a number of factors that can be controlled; these are temperature, 
pressure and/or the presence of catalyst(s). Depending on the aim of a reaction, a chemical engineer 
may be able to make the reaction proceed at an optimum rate. For example, it may be advantageous to 
make a reaction economical by proceeding very rapidly but not so rapidly as to produce an explosion.
The basic data required for the determination of chemical kinetics are the rate of change of products 
and reactants as a function of time. For example consider the reaction:
A + B → C
The concentration of the species at any given time are [A], [B] and [C], respectively. The rate of reaction 
is equal to the rate of change of any species, so: 
Rate of formation of product, C		
	
ൌ݀ሾܥሿ
݀ݐ
Rate of destruction of reactant, A or B	 	
ൌെ݀ሾܣሿ
݀ݐൌെ݀ሾܤሿ

Hence, in this case:

݀ݐൌെ1
ܽ
݀ሾܣሿ
݀ݐൌെ1
ܾ
݀ሾܤሿ
݀ݐ
Any of these derivatives can serve as the definition of the rate of reaction, as one molecule of B must 
be destroyed for every molecule of A destroyed and in the process one molecule of C is formed. The 
complexity increases when we have stoichiometric coefficients that are not 1. This is easiest to consider 
with an example:
a A + b B → c C + d D

When choosing the basis for stating the rate of reaction, it is important to state what species rate is chosen 
with respect to (A, B, C or D), to quote the chemical equation, thus avoiding ambiguity and keep the 
signs correct. Hence, the rate of reaction, for elementary reactions, is proportional to the concentrations 
of the reactants raised to some power, therefore, for the reaction above:

Equilibria and kinetics
where k, the rate constant, is independent of concentration but dependent on temperature. It should be 
emphasised that such convenient relationships between stoichiometry and rate do not always hold and 
that the rate equation is arrived at by experiment; the rate expression cannot necessarily be inferred by 
simply looking at the reaction equation.
Once a statement of the rate law is made, it allows a prediction of the rate, given the composition of a 
mixture and the experimental value of the rate constant. It shows a mechanism for the reaction, i.e. the 
way in which the molecules combine, and allows classification of reactions into various orders.
Order – the order of a reaction is the power to which the concentration of a component is raised in the 
rate equation. hence, the overall order of a reaction is the sum of the powers of all concentrations. In 
the example above, the reaction would be a order in A, b order in B and (a+b) order overall.
Principal factors affecting rate of reaction
As stated above, the rate of reaction can be affected by concentration, temperature and/or the presence 
of catalyst(s) 
Influence of concentration – this is described by the law of mass action, which states that the rate of 
chemical reaction is proportional to the product of active masses of interacting substances, as shown 
above this active mass equates to the concentration of a species raised to the power of its stoichiometric 
coefficient. In a gaseous system the active mass is expressed using the partial pressure of each component 
instead of concentration 
Influence of temperature – a rise in temperature usually results in a marked increase in reaction rate. The 
influence of temperature is often described by the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant, 
k to temperature:
e 
A
  
=
  
k
RT
Ea
- 
 
»
¼

«

ª
 
where A is the frequency Factor, which is constant for any given reaction and has the same units as k, Ea 
is the activation energy, again constant for any given reaction (J/mol), R is the Universal Gas Constant 
(J/mol K) and T is the absolute temperature in K. A good rule of thumb for simple reactions is that the 
rate doubles for every 10 K increase in temperature.
Influence of catalyst(s) – catalysts can have a spectacular effect on rate of reaction, and in some cases 
the rate can be increased by up to a factor of 106. Catalysts can increase or decrease (hinder) the rate of 
a reaction but in most cases they are used to make a process faster and increase the economic efficiency 
of a reaction. The process works by lowering the activation energy required within the reaction system, 
and the catalyst(s) remains unchanged at the end of reaction but will participate in intermediate steps. It 
should be appreciated that the presence of the catalyst accelerates both the reverse and forward reactions 
so is has no effect on the final equilibrium position of the reaction, it just makes the reaching of that 
equilibrium quicker. In a multi reaction system, a catalyst may favour one reaction over any others, 
hence, increasing the yield of a desired product.

Equilibria and kinetics
Determining chemical equilibrium
The equilibrium, also known as final, composition of a reaction mixture can be found using chemical 
equilibrium thermodynamics. For reactions that are irreversible there is only one reaction direction 
(reactants → products) and the concentration of the limiting reactant decreases as the reaction progresses 
eventually approaching zero. Eventually, in this case, could be seconds or years depending on the 
reaction. In this situation, the equilibrium composition corresponds to complete consumption of all 
of the limiting reactant. Other reactions are reversible, hence, reactants form products and products 
subsequently undergo reverse reactions to reform reactants. Such reversibility is commonly denoted by 
one of several symbols: 

↔⇔

            . In these systems equilibrium is reached at a certain point, 
remember that this equilibrium is dynamic.
To evaluate the equilibrium constant K, it is necessary to consider what is happening in the forward and 
reverse reactions, so again consider:
a A + b B ↔ c C + d D 
The rate of the forward reaction is described by the law of mass action; hence, the rate is proportional 
to the product of the active masses of the interactive substances therefore:

Equilibrium constants of homogeneous liquid and gaseous systems
Consider a homogeneous liquid phase system, with known concentrations of reactants and products 
at equilibrium, the equilibrium constant is the ratio of the active masses of the products with relation 
to the active masses of the reactants. This shows that a larger value indicates greater product formation 
and the equilibrium constant is calculated from:

Where Kc is unitless. The volume terms cancel out but this may not necessarily be the case depending 
on powers to which the concentrations are raised and the number of reactants and products.
Equilibrium constants of homogeneous liquid and gaseous systems
For gas phase systems, it is not possible to use the concentrations as for liquid systems, rather the 
concentration is expressed in terms of partial pressure raised to the power of the stoichiometric coefficient. 
Partial pressure being given by:

where y is mole fraction (unitless) and Ptotal is the total pressure, and for any gas phase equilibrium problem, 
pressure is always expressed in atmospheres (atm). The equilibrium constant, Kp is then calculated using: 
For example, consider the gaseous phase reaction:
C2H6 (g) ↔ H2 (g) + C2H4 (g)
Determine an expression relating extent of reaction (a) to Kp. 
Partial pressures of all reaction species, and the resulting active masses, are required to determine Kp, thus:

By having this expression for Kp in terms of a, it is possible, given a value for Kp to determine the

Effect of reaction conditions on the equilibrium position
Effect of reaction conditions on the 
equilibrium position
As mentioned previously, equilibrium is a dynamic state; such systems are in a state of flux and a small 
perturbation, in terms of a change in a system variable, will produce a different equilibrium point, altering 
the final composition of the product mixture. Such changes can be predicted.
Le Chatelier’s Principle – ‘if one of the conditions of a system in equilibrium be altered, the system will 
adjust itself in such a direction as to try and neutralise this change of condition.’ 
Influence of temperature
The influence of temperature on equilibrium position is different for endothermic and exothermic 
reactions, and each must be considered in turn to understand the predicted response within these systems.
Endothermic reactions – these have a positive heat of reaction, indicating that they take in heat from 
their surroundings during the progression of the reaction. As a consequence, such reactions are favoured 
by a rise in temperature, and this will raise the of rate reaction by supplying more heat to the molecules 
to increase the number of collisions. Increasing the temperature of an endothermic system will cause 
the equilibrium to move in such a way as to tend to reduce the temperature again, which is for the 
system to absorb heat, this drives the forward reaction, as it requires heat to be supplied to it. Hence, 
there is a shift in equilibrium to the right, producing higher product concentrations. In summary: T↑ 
Equil→ a↑or T↓ Equil← a↓, where a denotes the extent of reaction i.e. the number of moles of one of 
the products produced at equilibrium.
Exothermic reactions – these have a negative heat of reaction, indicating that they give heat to their 
surroundings during the progression of the reaction. As a result, such reactions are favoured by a lowering 
of temperature, although this can result in a decrease in rate as the molecules have reduced energy and, 
hence, do not participate in as many collisions; this means that a catalyst is often employed to increase 
the rate of reaction while cooling takes place. Increasing the temperature of an exothermic system will 
cause the equilibrium to move in such a way as to tend to reduce the temperature again, which is for the 
system to absorb heat, this drives the reverse reaction, as the forward reaction requires heat to be taken 
from it. Hence, there is a shift in equilibrium to the left, producing higher reactant concentrations. In 
summary: T↑ Equil← a↓ or T↓ Equil→ a↑, with α as above.

Effect of reaction conditions on the equilibrium position
Influence of concentration
This is easiest to understand by considering an example reaction:
A + B ↔ C + D
If an increased amount of A is fed in to the reactor, its concentration will increase relative to all the 
other species and the equilibrium will shift to the right so as to oppose the increased presence of A. 
Thus more A and B will be consumed and more C and D produced i.e. the yield with respect to B will 
be increased. This supports the theory of using excess inexpensive reagents to maximise the conversion 
of more expensive species. In summary: [A]↑ Equil→ a↑ or [C]↑ Equil← a↓.
Influence of pressure
The effects of pressure are only significant for reactions involving gases due to the incompressibility of 
liquids and solids. Consider a gaseous reaction where the number of moles on the product side are less 
than the number of moles on the reactant side:
A + B ↔ C
The production of product (C) is accompanied by a decrease in volume, 1 mole as compared to 2 moles, 
and will, therefore, be enhanced by an increase in pressure. Remember that according to the Gas Laws, 
volume is inversely proportional to pressure, hence a decrease in volume results in an increase in pressure. 
In summary: P↑ Equil→ a↑ or P↓ Equil← a↓.
Conversely, there may be a gaseous reaction system where the number of moles on the product side are 
greater than the number of moles on the reactant side, for example:
A ↔ B + C
The forward reaction is accompanied by an increase in volume, 2 moles as compared to 1 moles, and 
will, therefore, be enhanced by a decrease in pressure. As above volume and pressure are inversely 
proportional. In summary: P↑ Equil← a↓ or P↓ Equil→ a↑.
A third case that must be considered is when there is no change in the number of moles going from 
reactants to products, so moles on RHS equal moles on LHS. In this case, the equilibrium position is 
independent of pressure, as there is no change in volume.
On occasion, an inert species may be added to the reactant mixture, at constant total pressure, i.e. the 
addition of the inerts volume does not cause a pressure change itself, but it does in fact have the same 
effect as decreasing the pressure of the system, as the partial pressures of the reactants are decreased 
and there will be a reduction in their mole fractions reducing the number of collisions, the same as 
decreasing the pressure of each reactant.

Liquids and solutions
Liquids and solutions
As discussed in the previous chapter on physical properties of gases, liquids are one of the three states 
of matter, which has packing similar to a solid but with some spaces between the molecules, allowing 
them to move within the system. The ability of liquids to vaporise, and subsequently condense back to 
a liquid was also discussed, and is of great use in chemical engineering in the process of distillation.
Liquids
A liquid is a substance that has constant volume, hence a constant density, at a given temperature, but 
that can change its shape to suit the vessel of containment. In a liquid the position of the molecules is 
essentially fixed, with small intermolecular distances, thus it is difficult to compress a liquid, easier than 
for solids but the compression is considerably less than can be achieved for gases.
Vapour pressure
Similarly to gases, the molecular kinetic energy of any liquid is not a set value but rather varies around 
an average value for the distribution, as determined by Boltzmann’s Law, where the greatest number of 
particles have this average energy.

Liquids and solutions
There are some molecules that have an energy lower than the average and another portion that have an 
energy in excess of the mean; these more energetic molecules may have sufficient energy to be able to 
overcome the intermolecular forces binding the liquid and, if they are at the liquid-gas interface, vaporize. 
In an open system, the molecules will evaporate; in a closed system they will strike the walls of the 
vessel, exerting a pressure, and losing energy. Some molecules will lose sufficient energy that they will 
be unable to stay in the gas phase, rather they will condense into the liquid phase again. After a system 
defined period of time, the number of molecules evaporating will be equal to the number condensing, 
and vapour-liquid equilibrium is established. The final pressure exerted by the equilibrated system is 
known as the vapour pressure, which is temperature dependent. The volume of liquid and the volume 
above the liquid do not affect the equilibrium point and the same vapour pressure is achieved, hence, 
this is the vapour pressure of a given liquid at a given temperature. As the temperature increases, the 
kinetic energy of the molecules in the system increases, hence, increasing the pressure; the response of 
which follows a characteristic profile for each liquid with temperature. 
Boiling point
From the scenario described above, an increase in temperature increases the vapour pressure of a liquid, 
until a point where bubbles of vapour form in the bulk liquid and rise to the surface. The pressure 
inside the bubbles is equal to the sum of atmospheric pressure and the hydrostatic pressure resulting 
from the depth of the bubble in the liquid. The point where bubbles are produced vigorously within the 
system is called the boiling point. As the pressure of the bubbles is affected by atmospheric pressure, the 
boiling point is also affected by this parameter. At 1 atm pressure, the normal boiling point is achieved, 
if the atmospheric pressure is lower than 1 atm, the boiling point will be lower, as the vapour pressure 
required in the bubbles will be reduced, hence, a lower temperature will achieve the vapour pressure 
needed; similarly a higher than atmospheric pressure will increase the boiling point. The relationship 
between temperature and the boiling point is characteristic of each liquid, and can be used as a tool for 
characterisation of unknown liquids.
The boiling point can be affected by molecular weight, often increasing with molecular weight. The 
intermolecular forces binding a liquid must be overcome for it to form a vapour, and an increase in polarity 
of a compound, can increase these forces, hence the boiling point. The energy involved in transforming 
a given amount of liquid into a gas, at STP i.e. 1 atm and 0 ºC, is known as the heat of vaporisation, 
and the converse process has an energy associated with it, when a given quantity of gas condenses to a 
liquid, known as the heat of condensation. The existence of a boiling point is a traditional concept for 
most materials but there are some substances that will slowly decompose with the application of heat 
before reaching their boiling point.

Liquids and solutions
Distillation
Chemical engineers are interested in vaporisation and condensation processes as these are important 
in distillation, which pervades chemical industry extensively. It is a common process for purification or 
separation of liquids, for example in the drinks, and oil and gas industries. The separation of a mixture 
of liquids, based on the differences in their boiling points, is known as fractional distillation.
Freezing point
Decreasing the temperature of a liquid, causes the average kinetic energy of the molecules within the 
system to decrease; this has the effect of decreasing the vapour pressure of the liquid, as there are 
fewer molecules with sufficient energy to break free of the bulk liquid. Further decrease of the liquid 
temperature, continues to reduce the translational motion of the molecules and there comes a point 
where the intermolecular forces will dominate within in the system, and the viscosity increases. At this 
point the liquid approaches the state of being solid and the molecules in some systems will orient into 
a rigid crystalline arrangement. At a given pressure, the change from liquid to solid will always occur at 
the same temperature, and at standard pressure (1 atm) this is called the freezing point. This temperature 
is generally considered to also be equal to the melting point of the solid back to a liquid.
Critical state
In order to be able to fully appreciate the concept of the critical state of a substance, it is essential to 
consider all three phases of the substance simultaneously, rather than as pairs as above, e.g. liquid-gas 
interchange. This is easiest to do by considering a phase diagram. Here the substance is considered as 
being in a closed system with no interaction, such as heat loss or gain to other substances.

Liquids and solutions
The figure above shows the phase diagram for water. A phase is any form of a substance, e.g. solid, and 
multiple phases can exist together in a system, with distinct boundaries between them. By considering 
a phase diagram, the equilibrium phase for any given pressure and temperature can be determined. 
Note the boundaries between phases, in the diagram, where both phases can occur and, most notably, 
the triple point, which is where all three phases exist simultaneously. The conditions for the triple point 
are very specific, however, the solid, liquid and gaseous phases of a substance can all co-exist with their 
respective equilibrium processes.
Observe the figure above and how, by changing the temperature or pressure, it is possible to alter the 
phase of the substance. The effect of temperature has been addressed in the consideration of the three 
phases, with heat applied changing a solid to a liquid and then to a gas, and cooling reversing the process. 
The effect of pressure is also simply understood. Increasing the pressure on a gas or liquid system, will  
cause the system to act so as to reduce the volume of the substance, for a gas this is achieved by the 
compression to a liquid, the intermolecular spacing is reduced i.e. the volume is decreased. A similar 
scenario sees a reduction in volume going from liquid to solid. As may be anticipated, reducing the 
pressure will allow the substance to expand the intermolecular spacing changing solids to liquids, and 
liquids to gases. Mapping across from 1 atm on the pressure axis and seeing where it intersects the solid/
liquid and liquid/gas boundaries gives the values for the melting and boiling points, respectively, at 
standard conditions.

Liquids and solutions
The critical point is another specific point of note; this is where the gas phase created can no longer be 
compressed to become a liquid by manipulation of pressure alone. At a temperature below the critical 
temperature, it is possible to condense a gas to a liquid. Above the critical temperature, it can be seen 
that there is no region for liquid along the pressure axis, increasing pressure merely compresses the gas, 
but it will never liquefy. This point is substance dependent and strong intermolecular forces increase the 
value of the critical temperature.
The final special point on the graph exists in the left-hand corner at the interface between the solid and 
vapour phases; at the exact conditions of pressure and temperature that make the dividing line, the solid 
and vapour will co-exist and sublimation will occur.
Solutions
In the phase diagram and discussion above, the existence of discrete phases, or phases in equilibrium 
with each other have been considered. However, an important class of system is the solution, consisting 
of two or more components, at least one liquid (solvent(s)) and materials that are dissolved within the 
solvent(s), known as solute(s). Solvents are commonly but not exclusively liquids, they can also be solids 
and gases that dissolve materials within themselves, these are known as disperse systems. Solutes can be 
solids, gases or liquids, even when the solvent is also a liquid. Their respective roles are defined by their 
relative quantities within the system, which can be a difficult point if these are quite similar.
The concentration of species within a solution is important to quantify and can be defined in terms of 
mass percent (the mass ratio of solute to solvent), molarity (mol L-1) or molality (mol kg-1). There is 
another important quantity associated with solutions; the vapour pressure, where the component vapour 
pressures are additive, as given by Raoult’s law, which is valid when interactions between molecules 
of the components of a solution are similar to the interactions between molecules of each component. 
These solutions are known as ideal solutions. As discussed previously, there is a contrast between ideal 
and real gases, and the same is true for solutions. Real solutions show deviations from Raoult’s Law, as 
a consequence of the differences in intermolecular interactions, but it can be a very useful tool, and the 
system will always tend towards the ideal as the mole fraction of one component approaches one or zero.
The addition of solutes to solvents also gives rise to changes in the colligative properties of the solutions 
compared to the bulk liquid, as discussed in the following Colligative Properties chapter.
Heat of Solution and Mixing
When a solid or gas dissolves in a liquid or when two or more liquids are mixed the attractive forces 
between molecules of feed material are overcome and new forces exist between neighbouring molecules 
of the product mixture or solution. These changes in intermolecular interactions are accompanied by the 
net absorption or release of energy, which results in internal energy and enthalpy differences between the 
pure compounds and the mixture. For ideal solutions, this effect is neglected and it is assumed that the 
specific enthalpy for a substance in a mixture is equal to the specific enthalpy for the pure substance, which 
is a good assumption for gas mixtures and liquid mixtures of similar compounds. For an ideal solution:
hsoln T = xihi + xjhj

solute, so the value reaches a limiting quantity at infinite dilution.

Colligative properties
Colligative properties
Colligative Properties
Colligative properties are those properties of a solution dependent on the number of molecules in a 
set volume rather than on the physical attributes of the molecules i.e. their relative molecular mass 
or molecular size. Such properties include osmotic pressure, elevation of boiling point, lowering of 
freezing point and relative lowering of vapour pressure. Alteration of such properties has consequences 
in processing and it necessary to be able to determine the direction and magnitude of an effect. It is also 
possible to use experimental measurements of colligative properties to i) determine relative molecular 
masses of non-ionised solutes, for example glucose, and ii) estimate the degree of ionisation of ionised 
solutes, for example salts.
Osmotic Pressure
The pressure that must be applied to a liquid/solution to prevent the flow of water across a semi-permeable 
membrane is known as the osmotic pressure. The transfer of water through semi-permeable membranes 
(cell walls), which can be selective, is important in biological systems, regulating concentrations. The 
same processes can be used in engineering applications to desalinate sea water.

Colligative properties
There are two laws that govern the osmotic pressure of solutions, which state that osmotic pressure of 
a dilute solution is:
directly proportional to its concentration at constant temperature
directly proportional to its absolute temperature
It should be noted that osmotic pressure has the units of pressure, i.e. atm, bar, Pa etc., and that these 
laws are the analogues of the gas laws proposed by Boyle and Charles. This leads on to the analogous 
combined equation for ideal solutions, comparable to the ideal gas law:
πV = nRTi
where π is osmotic pressure (atm); V is volume (L); n is moles of solute (mol); R is the molar gas constant 
(L atm K-1 mol-1); and T is absolute temperature (K); i is the van’t Hoff factor.
Often simplified to:	
	
	
 π = “i”MRT
Where M is Molarity (mol/L). Note, it should be evident that the number of moles of solute divided by 
the volume of solution in which the solute is contained is a molarity.
The van’t Hoff factor is associated with the dissolution of the solute, and is determined from an equation 
utilising the ratio of the concentration particles produced on dissolution and the original concentration 
of the solute (n) and the degree of dissolution (α):
i = 1 + α(n − 1)
For example NaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl- as per:
NaCl ↔ Na+ + Cl-
For every mole of NaCl added to solution (LHS), there are two moles of particles produced (RHS), so the 
ratio (n) is 2/1 = 2, giving i = 1 + α. This will alter depending on the solute and the degree of dissolution.
Relative Lowering of Vapour Pressure
Understanding and being able to determine the vapour pressure of a given mixture of different species 
is essential in separation processes and is an important aspect of membrane science. Concentration and 
vapour pressure, for ideal solutions, are related by Raoult’s Law:

Colligative properties
The vapour pressure of an ideal solution is dependent on the vapour pressure of each chemical component 
and the mole fraction of the component present in the solution
This assumes that the chemical interactions between components of a mixed solution are the same as 
the bonding within the components making up the mixture.
Imagine a mixture containing components A and B, each component will have its own vapour pressure 
but when the two are mixed and have, most importantly, reached an equilibrium, the vapour pressure 
of the mixture will be a sum of the individual components, such that:
Pmixture = PAXA + PBXB
where P is pressure and X is mole fraction (unitless).
As the contributions from each component are related to the mole fraction of that component, increasing 
the number of species, hence total moles, will reduce the vapour pressure of each component. It also 
follows that dissolving a pure solute, with zero vapour pressure, i.e. it will not evaporate at the temperature 
of study, in a liquid, the vapour pressure of the mixture will be lower than that of the liquid alone.
Boiling and Freezing Points
The temperatures at which solutions boil or freeze can significantly alter the thermodynamic requirements 
of a process and need to be fully understood. Addition of solute to a liquid can alter both these parameters 
by differences in the vapour pressure of the resulting solution, for example adding salt to ice (water) in 
winter to lower its freezing point and clear icy roads.
Elevation of Boiling/Liquefaction Point (ebullioscopy)
The degree of elevation of boiling point (BPt) is proportional to the reduction of the vapour pressure 
of a dilute solution:
 BPtsolution = BPtsolvent + ΔTBPt
And	
	
	
	
	
ΔTBPt = m x KBPt x i 
pm is molality (moles of solute with respect to mass of solvent, in mol kg-1); KBPt is the ebullioscopic 
constant (0.512 ºC kg mol-1 for the boiling point of water); i is the van’t Hoff factor (see osmotic pressure).
The boiling (or liquefaction) point of a given liquid (starting without solute) is achieved when an 
equilibrium exists between the liquid and gas phases. Equilibrium is a dynamic process, in the case 
of boiling point the rate of molecules evaporating from the liquid to the gas phase equals the rate of 
molecules condensing from the gas to liquid phase. The addition of a solute to the liquid acts to reduce 
the concentration of the liquid molecules, in turn reducing the evaporation of liquid to gas phase pathway 
in the equilibrium, as there is effectively less driving force in terms of liquid concentration as per Le 
Chatelier’s principle. This means that more heat must be supplied to the system to drive the equilibrium, 
so the system boils at a higher temperature.

Colligative properties
Suppression of Freezing/Melting Point (cryoscopy)
The degree of suppression of freezing point (MPt) is proportional to the reduction of the vapour pressure 
of a dilute solution:
 MPtsolution = MPtsolvent – ΔTMPt
And	
	
	
	
	
ΔTMPt = m x KMPt x i 
Where m is molality (moles of solute with respect to mass of solvent, in mol kg-1); KMPt is the ebullioscopic 
constant (1.86 ºC kg mol-1 for the freezing point of water); i is the van’t Hoff factor (see osmotic pressure).
The freezing (or melting) point, where an equilibrium exists between liquid and solid phases is usually 
reduced upon the addition of a solute, as compared to the pure solvent to which the solute is added. 
This is a result of the solute particles being unable to form part of the solid phase, as they are dissolved, 
so a lower proportion of the molecules in the solution contribute to the equilibrium. As equilibrium is a 
dynamic process, the system acts to re-establish equilibrium, which is when the rate of freezing becomes 
equal to the rate of melting i.e. the vapour pressures of the liquid and the solid in the system must be 
equal. This point is generally achieved at a lower temperature than for the pure solvent.

Chemical reactions
Chemical reactions
When dealing with chemical reactions there are several key terms that should be understood to allow 
full understanding of the process. The language has been developed in order to handle actual industrial 
chemical reactions. These definitions must be understood and are fundamental to the understanding 
of reaction variables.
Reaction terminology
Limiting reactant – this is the reactant that is present in the smallest stoichiometric amount. The limiting 
reactant determines the maximum extent to which a reaction can proceed, and if the reaction is 100 % 
complete then all of the limiting reactant is consumed and the reaction can proceed no further.
Excess reactant – refers to all other reactants within the process with exception of the limiting reactant. 
It is important to remember that the term may refer to more than one reactant.
Percentage excess (%XS) – this is based on the quantity of excess reactant above the amount required 
to react with the total quantity of limiting reactant according to the balanced chemical equation as per:

%
×
=
The limiting and excess reactants, and associated percentage excesses are calculated from the feed 
quantities and reaction stoichiometry and give no indication of how much material has actually reacted 
at equilibrium.
Percent conversion – this is the percentage of any reactant that has been converted to products.
Degree of completion – refers to the percentage or fraction of the limiting reactant that has been 
converted to products.
Yield – for a single reactant and a product, the yield is the mass (or moles) of a chosen final product 
divided by the mass (or moles) of one of the initial reactants. If more than one product and more than 
one reactant are involved, the species on which the yield is based must be clearly stated. For example in 
A + B  C + D, one possible yield expression would be number of moles of C/mole of A.
Initially to gain information about a system chemical engineers use hypothetical calculations, with 
information from the balanced stoichiometric chemical reaction To fully understand what is actually 
happening, the yield, degree of completion and percentage conversion need to be considered, where 
available. Such quantities are based on what is actually reacting in the system and what is produced.

Chemical reactions
In order to determine which quantity is limiting and which is in excess, the stoichiometric proportions 
(SPs) can be calculated using:
ܵܲൌ
݂݁݁݀ܽ݉݋ݑ݊ݐ
ݏݐ݋݄݅ܿ݅݋݁ݐݎ݅ܿܿ݋݂݂݁݅ܿ݅݁݊ݐݏ
The smallest SP determines the limiting reactant, meaning all others are in excess.
Extent of reaction α – when working with chemical reactions, it is useful to use the concept of extent of 
reaction to ease calculations. The extent to which a reaction proceeds (i.e. the material actually reacting 
can be expressed by) the extent of reaction (α) in moles. α conventionally relates the feed quantities 
to the amount of each component present in the product stream, after the reaction has proceeded to 
equilibrium, through the stoichiometry of the reaction. While the feed quantities are a useful tool in 
calculating extent of reacting, α can be based on any of the components, reactants or products, in the 
process. The maths involved is often easier if the component chosen has a stoichiometric coefficient of 1 
itself but this is not always possible and, in some cases such as concurrent reactions, α has to be related 
to a term that appears in all reactions.
Ignoring the possibility of accumulation within a system, the balance for each reactant and product is 
generally:
output from reactor = (input in feed) – (consumption) + (generation)
All consumption and generation terms are expressed in terms of α, with consumption terms related to 
what is reacting (these are negative α terms) and generation terms related to what is produced (these 
are positive α terms). The representation of the amount of each species within a system is called a 
component balance.
Worked example – write a complete set of component balances for the following reaction:
2SO2 + O2  2SO3
For each component the balance is: output = input – consumption + generation
Within this relationship all terms fit into either the consumption or generation category:
Consumption terms:	
SO2 and O2
Generation term:	
SO3
The extent of reaction has to be defined in terms of one component only and this should be stated clearly. 
So in this example, let α = the moles of O2 reacting

Chemical reactions
α is a theoretical construct to assist in dealing with unknown quantities and should be treated in the same 
way in terms of proportionality as the stoichiometric coefficients in the fully balanced reaction equation. 
So in the same way that the number of moles of O2 used can be calculated from the number of moles 
of SO3 that is produced in a 1:2 ratio as they have stoichiometric coefficients of 1 and 2, respectively; it 
is straightforward to calculate that the same ratio holds for α, i.e. α moles of O2 would react to produce 
2α moles of SO3.
Take each component in turn and apply a component balance using α and the balanced reaction 
stoichiometry, to give:
(SO2)out	=	
(SO2)in – 2α
(O2)out	 =	
(O2)in – α
(SO3)out	=	
(SO3)in + 2α	
But (SO3)in = 0 	so (SO3)out = 2α
Such balances, when used with additional information, such as the yield and percentage conversion 
can allow unknown inputs and outputs to be determined. This is extremely useful when evaluating the 
expected equilibrium yield of a process and the effect that a change in the system conditions may invoke.

Chemical reactions
This approach, of using α to determine the composition of a system, is particularly useful when dealing 
with multiple reactions that occur simultaneously. This is best demonstrated with an example: in a reactor 
ethylene is oxidized to either ethylene oxide or carbon dioxide:
	
	
	
	
C2H4 + ½O2 → C2H4O
(1)
	
	
	
	
C2H4 + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O
(2)
As stated above α can be based on any species in the reaction but close observation of the two reactions 
shows that only ethylene or oxygen occur in both reactions, hence, one of them should be selected. As 
the stoichiometric coefficients for ethylene are 1 in both reactions, it is best to select this as the basis of 
α. The reactions should also be labelled (as above) to identify their contributions to the overall process 
composition.
As there are two reactions occurring simultaneously, there needs to be two extents of reaction, one for 
reaction (1), α1, and a second for reaction (2), α2. Hence α1 is the number of moles of C2H4 reacted in 
(1) and α2 is the number of moles of C2H4 reacted in (2)
Combining the contribution of each reaction to the consumption of reactants and the generation of 
products, the component balances are:
(C2H4)out	
=	
(C2H4)in – a1 – a2
(O2)out	 	
=	
(O2)in – 0.5a1 – 3a2
(C2H4O)out	
=	
(C2H4O)in + a1	 	
But (C2H4O)FEED=0	
so (C2H4O)out = a1
(CO2)out		
=	
(CO2)in + 2a2	
	
But (CO2)FEED = 0	
so (CO2)out = 2a2
(H2O)ou	t	
=	
(H2O)in + 2a2	
	
But (H2O)FEED = 0	
so (H2O)out = 2a2
As extent of reaction allows the determination of the number of moles of each species that are used or 
produced it also allows the evaluation of the masses of the output stream. This can be compared to the 
inputs and, as accumulation is being ignored, the result should be mass conservation, which is a useful 
check in such calculations.
Extent of reaction is a powerful tool in the determination of process compositions and provides a large 
amount of information to be elucidated for balances over unit operations.

Hess’s law and temperature dependence of equilibria
Hess’s law and temperature 
dependence of equilibria
Within chemical engineering, it is important to be able to understand whether a process gives out heat 
when a reaction occurs or whether there is a need to supply heat to the process. It is also useful to 
have some information about the magnitude of the energy involved. In order to achieve these two aims 
chemical engineers can calculate the heat of reaction (DHR), but as this quantity varies with temperature, 
it is necessary to specify the conditions on which DHR is based. Generally the Standard Heat of Reaction 
(DHɵ
R) is determined, this being the heat of reaction at standard conditions: 1 atm and 25 ºC. This 
requires the reactants and products to be taken in their standard state, i.e. the most stable phase at 1 
atm and 25 ºC
Chemical reactions
When molecules collide, energy is released and, if this energy is sufficient then the reaction is activated 
and proceeds, this requires reactant bonds to be broken and product bonds to be formed. This results 
in either a net intake of energy (endothermic reaction, from the ancient Greek ‘endo’ meaning internal) 
or a net release of energy (exothermic reaction, from the ancient Greek ‘exo’ meaning external).
It is essential that designers of new chemical plants know how much heat each reaction generates or 
absorbs and that they make sure the plant can accommodate the net heat change. To enable them to do 
that, chemical engineers determine the heat (or enthalpy) of reaction, which is used to express the amount 
of energy released into or absorbed from the environment. The heat of reaction is represented by ΔHR. 
Once calculated, the heat of reaction can provide a large amount of information. If the value is negative, 
then energy is released from the reaction system into environment, and the reaction is referred to as 
being exothermic. A positive heat of reaction, indicates that energy would be absorbed from environment 
into the system, and the reaction would be termed endothermic.
Industrial Chemical Reactions
It is common for large enthalpy changes occur in chemical processes, as said above for an endothermic 
process, heat is required from the surroundings so must be provided when working on a large scale, 
this sustains the reaction temperature and prevents the reaction rate from dropping. It is important to 
note, that sometimes the cost to provide heat to the reaction exceeds the cost of the reactants themselves, 
however, it may be worthwhile if the end product is sufficiently valuable.

Hess’s law and temperature dependence of equilibria
Conversely, for an exothermic reaction, it is known that heat is given out by the system but it may be 
necessary to remove this heat in some cases by methods other than radiative heat loss from the reaction 
vessel. This is required to avoid a runaway reaction occurring and it is very common to remove heat 
from reactor using water, which has the benefit of producing ‘heated’ water that can be utilised elsewhere 
in plant, preventing waste.
As a consequence of these required measures, the heat of reaction can play an important role in the economics 
of a chemical process. Engineers must understand that industrial heats of reaction vary with temperature 
(covered in energy balances) but at low and moderate pressure, they are nearly independent of pressure. 
When determining the heat for any reaction, the process must be understood in terms of the stoichiometry 
of the reactants and products, as well as the state of aggregation (gas, liquid or solid) of all species involved 
in the reacting system. The state of matter of each component can significantly alter the heat of reaction 
value, for example the combustion of methane can have widely different values depending on the state of 
the water produced: 25 ºC and 1 atm:
	
	
	
	
	
	
 ΔHR at 25 ºC and 1 atm
CH4 (g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)	
	
-890 kJ mol-1
CH4 (g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)	
	
-802.3 kJ mol-1

Hess’s law and temperature dependence of equilibria
The difference of 87.7 kJ mol-1 is due to the fact that water is liquid in the first reaction and vapour in the 
second. This variance is associated with the heat of vaporisation of water at 25 ºC and 1 atm.
Standard Heat of Reaction
As the heat of reaction, ΔHR varies with temperature, it is necessary to specify the conditions on which 
ΔHR is based, and it is usual to state ΔHR at the standard conditions of 1 atm and 25ºC. The heat is then 
referred to as the standard heat of reaction, ΔHɵ
R, for which the reactants and products are taken as being 
in their standard state, i.e. the most stable state at 1 atm and 25ºC.
As there are a multitude of chemical reactions, there will be a large number of associated DHɵ
R values, 
so it is not always possible or practical to list all the values of DHɵ
R values for every conceivable reaction. 
This is also unnecessary as it is sufficient to know information such as the standard heat of formation 
(DHɵ
f) or standard heat of combustion (DHɵ
C) for each compound involved in a reaction. Using the 
standard values for formation or combustion one of two methods of can be used to calculate DHɵ
R. One 
method is equation manipulation; the other is Hess’s Law of Constant Summation.
Equation manipulation
This involves constructing formation or combustion reactions for the species contained in the overall 
reaction equation and manipulating these formation (or combustion) equations to satisfy the stoichiometry 
of the overall equation and ensure molecules appear on the reactant or product side as desired.
Worked example – using equation manipulation determine DHɵ
R for combustion of n-pentane.
Overall equation:	
	
C5H12 (l) + 8 O2 (g)→ 5 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (l)
Formation reactions:

C(s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)
(2)
	
	
	
	
H2 (g) + ½ O2 (g) → H2O (l)

R) =
-3509.5 kJ mol-1
As mentioned before this energy is only correct at standard temperature and pressure so any changes 
in either would need to be taken into account and a new value determined.
Hess’s law of constant summation
The energies involved in the formation or combustion of the component species in a chemical reaction 
equation can be used, summatively, to evaluate the energy of the process as a whole, via the method of 
Hess’s Law of Constant Summation. The values used in these calculations are standard heats of formation 
or standard heats of combustion.
Standard heats of formation – the evaluation of the standard heat of reaction, DHɵ
R, from values of 
standard heat of formation, DHɵ
f, can be summarised by the following equation:
DHɵ
R = Σ [DHɵ
f (Products)] - Σ[DHɵ
f (Reactants)]
Using this notation is more convenient than stoichiometric formation equations. Importantly, elements 
are already formed so have no heat of formation associated with them, so should be excluded from 
calculations.
Worked example – using Hess’s Law of Constant Summation determine DHɵ
R for combustion of 
n-pentane.
Overall equation:	
	
C5H12 (l) + 8 O2 (g)→ 5 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (l)
DHɵ
R = Σ (DHɵ
f (Products)) - Σ(DHɵ
f (Reactants))
Ignore O2 as elemental.
DHɵ
R = [5(DHɵ
f) CO2 (g)] + [6(DHɵ
f) H2O (l)] – [(DHɵ
f) C5H12 (l)]
DHɵ
R = [5 x -393.5] + [6 x -285.84] - [-173.0] = -3509.5 kJ/mol
It is important to remember to include the stoichiometric coefficients and pay close attention to signs 
in mathematical evaluation.

Hess’s law and temperature dependence of equilibria
Standard heats of combustion – thermochemical data is often also tabulated in the form of Standard 
Heats of Combustion, DHɵ
C, which can also be used to calculate heats of reaction where:
DHɵ
R = Σ [DHɵ
C (Reactants)] - Σ[DHɵ
C (Products)]
Similarly to the heats of formation there are some species that do not contribute to the heat of reaction 
calculation, in this case if any reactant or product are themselves combustion products, i.e. oxidised 
species, then the DHɵ
C term in the equation for that species is 0. The standard heats of combustion of 
any elements involved in the chemical reaction are not zero and must be included, i.e. they will combust.
The alteration in formula between the two standard heat sets originates from the algebraic manipulation 
of the combustion and formation reactions. Key substances appear on the LHS in combustion reactions 
as opposed to the RHS in formation reactions.
Considerations for thermochemical calculations
The conditions of phase and temperature must be closely observed in thermochemical calculations, ad 
this is particularly important for compounds such as water which can exist as more than one phase under 
common conditions. Variations in temperature must be accommodated through specific heat capacity 
and any changes in phase through latent heats, but usually the effect of pressure on the value of heat of 
reaction is small and can be considered negligible. Additionally, if there are excess reactants present in 
a reaction mixture, then the calculation should be based only on the amount of material actually taking 
part in the reaction.
Often the data provided for a calculation will be a mixture of heats of formation and heats of combustion, 
by understanding the underlying basis of the Hess approach it is possible to use such data to elucidate 
a required quantity. This is best demonstrated through an example.
Worked Example – calculate standard heat of reaction for the following reaction at 25 ºC and 1 atm:
C6H6 (g) + 3H2 (g) → C6H12 (g)
Using the following information
ΔHɵ

The best starting strategy is to assess what information is provided and what is missing. Close inspection

f (Reactants)]

Hess’s law and temperature dependence of equilibria
It is now possible to return to the original reaction and calculate ΔHɵ
R:
	
	
	
	
	
DHɵ
R	
= Σ [DHɵ
f (Products)] - Σ[DHɵ
f (Reactants)]
	
	
	
	
	
	
= [ΔHɵ

f C6H6 (g)]
	
	
	
	
	
	
= [-123] – [71.94]
	
	
	
	
	
	
= 195 kJ mol-1 C6H6 (g) reacted
Phase changes – when using standard heats of formation or combustion, it is essential that the phase 
of every component is known and taken into account, as any phase changes must be factored into the 
calculation. This is often the case for water:
H2 (g) + ½O2 (g) → H2O (l)	
	
DHɵ
f H2O (l) 	
-68.318 kcal mol-1	
–
H2 (g) + ½O2 (g) → H2O (g 	
	
DHɵ
f H2O (g) 	
-57.798 kcal mol-1
H2O (l) → H2O (g)	
	
	
So, DHV is	
 10.520 kcal mol-1 of H2O changing phase
Note the value for liquid water is more negative, i.e. more energy is released this is due to the heat given 
out by the system during the liquefaction of water vapour to liquid water, which itself has less energy – 
think about molecular motion in gases versus liquids.
Phase changes associated with solutions are probably less obvious but also need to be considered and 
factored into calculations. For example, the data provided may be for DHɵ
f HCl (g) but DHɵ
f HCl (aq) is 
desired, so it would be necessary to correct through the heat of solution, DHɵ
soln HCl ∞, such that:
½H2 (g ) + ½Cl2 (g) → HCl (g)	
	
DHɵ
f HCl (g) 	
-22.063 kcal mol-1 	
+
HCl (g) → HCl (aq)∞	
	
	
DHɵ
sol HCl∞ 	
-17.960 kcal mol-1
½ H2 (g) + ½Cl2 (g) → HCl (aq)∞	
	
DHɵ
f HCl (aq)∞ 	
-40.023 kcal mol-1 HCl produced
Strategies for dealing with thermochemical calculations
Firstly, it is important to write out a fully balanced chemical equation with stoichiometric coefficients and 
labelling species with the phases involved. Any phase changes must be taken into account with relation 
to the data being used. Using the reaction stoichiometry the heat of reaction can then be determined 
using one or more Hess relationships and paying particular attention to units of values used. Reporting 
the value, remember to state the species to which it relates and the molar quantity involved.

Hess’s law and temperature dependence of equilibria
Variation of enthalpy with pressure
The effect of pressure variation on enthalpy can be considered to be negligible in applications involving 
changes of phase and significant changes in temperature.
Temperature dependence of equilibrium constant
The change in ‘Gibbs Free Energy’, DGɵ determines whether or not a chemical reaction will take place. 
For a chemical reaction to significantly proceed, DGɵ must be negative. We define DGɵ as:
DGɵ = DHɵ - T DSɵ
where DSɵ is the entropy change of the reaction.
Also:	
	
	
	
 DGɵ = ΣDGɵ
f (products) - ΣDGɵ
f (reactants) 
The change in Gibbs free energy can also be related to the equilibrium constant, Kp in the following way:
DGɵ = - RT ln Kp
Note that Kp is always expressed in multiples of atmospheres, or is possibly unitless. 
By combining these two equations, a direct relationship between temperature and equilibrium constant 
can be obtained:

Hess’s law and temperature dependence of equilibria
Giving the van’t Hoff equation which describes the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant. 
This equation is in keeping with Le Chatelier’s principle. For example take an exothermic reaction, where 
DHɵ is negative, and increase the temperature. Raising the temperature means that T2 is greater than T1, 
so from the van’t Hoff equation ln KP1 – ln KP2 is positive, meaning that ln KP1 is greatest, therefore, KP2 is 
smaller than KP1. A reduction in Kp indicates a reduction in equilibrium yield. Equilibrium is shifted to the 
left, as expected by Le Chatelier’s principle for the given system.

Material balances
Material balances
Material balances are one of the topics that set chemical engineers apart from other engineers but it 
is essential to understand the underlying basic chemical principles. In order to perform balances it is 
important to categorise the process and all processes can be classified as one of batch, continuous or 
semi batch.
Batch processes – the feed is charged into the process system at the beginning of the process and all 
products are removed all at once some time later. No mass crosses the system boundary, excluding when 
the initial charge occurs and at the removal of the products at the end of process. Batch processes are 
generally used for small scale production and are operated in unsteady state. An example would be adding 
chemical reactants to a container, allowing the reaction to proceed to equilibrium and withdrawing the 
products once equilibrium has been achieved, as may be required when relatively small quantities are 
involved and/or the reaction is performed on a single occasion.
Continuous processes – the inputs and outputs flow continuously throughout the duration of the process. 
Such processes are more often used for large scale production and operated in either steady or unsteady 
state. An example would be the distillation of a mixture of liquids, feeding the liquids in to the bottom 
of the column, at a steady rate, and withdrawing the vapour from the top of the column also at a steady 
rate. In industrial applications, where large production rates are involved, often to increase profitability, 
the process is run as close to steady-state as possible.
Semi-batch (also semi-continuous) – this term is used to describe any process that is neither batch or 
continuous, incorporating processes where part of any reactant can be fed or part of any product removed 
during the process. An example would be allowing the contents of a pressurised gas container to escape 
to the atmosphere. As mentioned above these processes can be sub-classified as steady-state, which 
occurs when all the variables in a process do not change with time and includes batch, continuous and 
semi-batch processes, and unsteady-state (or transient), which occurs when process variables change 
with time. This includes continuous processes.
General Mass Balance Equation
By understanding the flow of mass within a process system it is possible to determine whether scenarios 
such as leakage, fouling, absorption of reactants/products or erroneous measurement are occurring. This 
is best managed by performing a mass balances on the system; where the inputs and outputs are related 
to each other as per the General Mass Balance Equation (GMBE):
input + generation – output – consumption = accumulation

Chemistry for Chemical Engineers

Material balances
Where:		
input 	 	
= all of the material that enters through the system boundaries
	
	
generation	
= all of the material that is produced within the system
	
	
output	 	
= all of the material that leaves through the system boundaries
	
	
consumption	
= all of the material that is consumed within the system
	
	
accumulation	
= all of the material that builds up within the system
This relationship assumes no nuclear reactions are involved and that the law of total mass conservation 
is obeyed. The general mass balance can be applied to several different types of balances, mainly total 
balances, which are based on the total quantities of materials involved in the system i.e. the input and 
output masses; component balances, where a balance is written for all individual substance using the 
GMBE in terms of extent of reaction; and element balances, these are based on all atomic species in the 
reaction, as excluding nuclear reactions all atoms of an element entering the system must, in turn, be 
in the output stream. These balances can be written in one of two forms, either differential balances, 
which indicate what is happening in a system at any given instant in time and each term is written as 
a rate, per unit time e.g. kg/hr; or integral balances, describing what happens between two instants in 
time, so that each term is an total amount e.g. kg.
For integral balances applied to simple batch, between their initial and final states, and differential 
balances applied to continuous steady-state processes the GMBE can be simplified, as accumulation is 
zero i.e. there is no build-up within system, so:
input + generation = output + consumption
When performing material balances it is always good practice to use a flowchart to keep account of all 
flows, this can be done for individual unit operations, which can then be added together to produce a 
Process Flow Diagram (PFD). Within the calculation, choose a basis that is suitable to allow material 
balances equations to be set up and solved for unknown variables, before feeding back into the flow 
chart, perhaps to supply information for another unit operation. Suitable bases would be that for a 
known mass fraction choose total mass or mass flowrate, and for a known mole fraction choose a total 
moles or molar flowrate basis.
Drawing flowcharts
Flowcharts allow chemical engineers to keep a record of all flows within a system and may be annotated 
with lots of useful information. They provide details and values at a glance, organising information 
provided about a process in a convenient way that makes subsequent analysis and calculation easier. 
The most efficient method to draw a flowchart is the use of schematics and/or symbols to represent 
process units, such as reactors, mixers, separation units, etc., and lines with arrows to represent inputs 
and outputs, allowing material balance calculations to get started and keep them moving.

Material balances
A flowchart must be fully labelled when started, with all known values for process variables and symbols 
for unknown variables being written for each input and output stream, providing a running tally for 
the problem solution, as each unknown variable is determined enter its value into the flowchart, thus 
producing a continuous record of where the solution stands and what must still be done. Often, algebraic 
symbols are assigned to unknown stream variables, for example m (kg solution/min), x (lb-mol N2 /lb-
mol), and n (kmol C3H8), and these variable names and their units are written on the flowchart 
Common shortcuts that can simplify flow diagrams include using multiples of one unknown parameters 
where relationships exist, for example if the mass of stream 1 is known to be half that of stream 2, label 
the masses of these streams as m and 2m, rather than m1 and m2. Similar methods can be employed 
with mass fractions, for example the mass fraction of N2 is 3 times that of O2, hence label these mass 
fractions as y g O2 /g and 3y g N2 /g rather than y1 and y2. Within any diagram, the last mass or mole 
fraction to be labelled must be 1 minus the sum of all the others and when volumetric flowrates are 
given it is useful to label the stream with either the analogous mass or molar flowrate, since balances 
are not written on a volumetric basis.
m is always used to represent mass, n for moles, V for volume and the same symbols with dots above 
them represent the flowrates of these terms. x is use for the component fraction, as either mass or moles, 
in a liquid, while y would be the mole fraction in a gas mixture.

Material balances
The methodologies outlined above can be used to both reactive and non-reactive systems, which have 
some subtle differences that are explained here.
Non-reactive systems
If no chemical reaction is taking place, this is called a non-reactive system, within which all balances are 
valid on a mass or mole basis where the generation and consumption terms are zero, hence:
input = output
Reactive Systems
As the name suggests, these are systems in which a chemical reaction takes place and there are several 
methods of calculation for reactive systems, being total balance, which is valid on a mass basis only 
with generation and consumption terms equal to zero; element balance, this is valid on a mass or molar 
basis and again the generation and consumption terms are zero; lastly, component balance, where the 
stoichiometry is taken into account as well as the extent of reaction, so this has to be on a molar basis 
and generation and consumption terms have to be considered. For any of the three balances, the GMBE 
will always be applicable, even if some terms are subsequently neglected.
Combustion Reactions
This is a special class of a reactive system, where there is a rapid reaction of a fuel with oxygen and 
is probably more important than any other class of industrial chemical reactions but the combustion 
products are relatively worthless compared with the fuels burned to obtain them. The importance lies 
in the quantities of heat released during such reactions, used to produce steam to drive turbines that 
generate most of the world’s electrical power. Chemical Engineers are heavily involved in analysing 
combustion reactions and reactors, and working towards the abatement and control of environmental 
pollution caused by these combustion products.
Combustion terminology – this is important to understand the processes occurring and communicate 
this to other engineers and colleagues. A fuel is required and will consist of coal, fuel oil, gaseous fuel, 
such as natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. The fuel combusts to form carbon dioxide and carbon 
monoxide, from the carbon contained in it, and water, from the hydrogen content. When carbon 
monoxide is formed during combustion this is called incomplete combustion. The common source of 
oxygen used in combustion reactions is air, as it is cheap and readily available, and the output gases 
can be referred to as either stack gas, which includes all gases that result from a combustion process 
including water vapour, so it is a wet basis, or flue gas, reporting the gases that result from a combustion 
process not including water vapour, also known as a dry basis or Orsat analysis (a technique for stack 
gas analysis on a dry basis).

Material balances
Within these output streams, for air reactions, one species will always occur and that is nitrogen, known as 
a tie element, material that passes through a system without change, depletion or addition. An important 
concept within chemical energy is the theoretical and excess air used in a reaction, this is due to the 
fact that in a reaction where one reactant is expensive it is practical to feed the less expensive reactant in 
excess to increase the yield of the valuable reactant at the expense of the cost of the excess reactants and 
addition of pumping costs. In combustion reactions air is inexpensive; therefore, combustion reactions 
are run with more air than needed to supply the oxygen required for the stoichiometric proportion to 
the fuel. The following terms are commonly used to describe the proportions of fuel and air to a reactor.
Theoretical oxygen – this is the number of moles (batch) or molar flow-rate (continuous) of oxygen 
needed for complete combustion of all the fuel fed to the reactor, assuming all carbon in fuel is oxidised 
to carbon dioxide and all hydrogen is oxidised to water.
Theoretical air – this is quantity of air that contains the theoretical oxygen.
Excess air – defined the amount by which the air fed to the reactor exceeds the theoretical air value, 
and the percentage excess air is:
% Excess air = (

(
)
(
)

−
From this it is essential to remember that the theoretical air value is the air required for complete 
combustion of all fuel regardless of how far the reaction has proceeded. Confusion often occurs if this is 
forgotten, as the theoretical air required to burn a given quantity of fuel does not depend on how much 
is actually burning and the percentage excess air depends only on the theoretical air and the air feed 
rate, not how much oxygen is consumed in the reactor or whether combustion is complete or partial.
Material Balances on Combustion Reactions
The procedure is essentially the same as for any reactive system, however, the following additional points 
should be considered. When drawing and labelling flowcharts remember to include nitrogen at both the 
inlet and outlet, include unreacted fuel and unreacted oxygen at the outlet, and list all possible combustion 
products i.e. carbon dioxide, water and carbon monoxide. If several reactions occur simultaneously 
such as combustion to give carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide separate equations must be used for 
each reaction and element balances are the most appropriate balance. In contrast, for singular reactions 
component or element are both equally useful.

Energy balances
Energy balances
As a chemical engineer designing a process, one principal job would be to account for the energy that 
flows into and out of each process unit and determine the overall energy requirement of the system. 
This is done by writing an energy balance, which is performed in the same way as material balances, but 
rather than the mass flow to/from process, it is the energy flow. To calculate the energies generated or 
absorbed by each unit operation it is essential to understand the key underlying principles and concepts.
Heat capacity
The heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a given amount 
of that substance by one degree. Hence, the units of heat capacity are energy per temperature per mass 
(or moles) e.g. cal g-1 ºC-1 or kJ K-1 kmol-1.
Sensible Heat and Heat Capacities
The heat that must be transferred to raise or lower the temperature of a substance, or mixture of substances, 
is known as the sensible heat and the quantity of heat required to produce a specified temperature change 
in a system can be determined from the First Law of Thermodynamics, which states that ‘the increase 
in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added by heating the system, minus the 
amount lost as a result of the work done by the system on its surroundings’.

Energy balances
The work done in a closed system, such as a batch process, is the change in internal energy, in contrast to 
the work done in an open system, including semi-batch or continuous, which is the change in enthalpy. 
This assumes neglect of kinetic (system stationary) and potential (no vertical displacement) energy 
and work (no moving boundaries). So to determine the sensible heat for a heating or cooling process, 
either the change in internal energy or the change in enthalpy need to be determined for the specified 
temperature change, as both of these quantities depend strongly on temperature. It should be noted 
that internal energy and enthalpy may be referred to as ‘specific’, meaning that they are quoted per unit 
mass. As a consequence, two considerations should be made, firstly variations in temperature at constant 
volume and, secondly, variations in temperature at constant pressure.
Constant volume systems – as the temperature is raised or lowered, the internal energy varies. The 
increase in internal energy represents the heat transferred to the substance at constant volume and the 
heat capacity at a constant volume is denoted by CV and is related to internal energy by:
ܥ௏= ൬ܷ݀
݀ܶ൰ܽݐܿ݋݊ݏݐܽ݊ݐݒ݋݈ݑ݉݁
Constant pressure systems – similar to internal energy, as temperature is raised or lowered, the enthalpy 
varies. The heat capacity at constant pressure is denoted by CP and is related to enthalpy by:
ܥ௉= ൬݀ܪ
݀ܶ൰ܽݐܿ݋݊ݏݐܽ݊ݐ݌ݎ݁ݏݏݑݎ݁
The increase in enthalpy represents the heat transferred to the substance at constant pressure
‘Specific’ heat is sometimes used to denote heat capacity expressed on a per-unit-mass basis; CP and CV 
are physical properties and are tabulated in standard references. Most chemical industry processes do 
not involve material at a fixed volume but rather at a set pressure so CP is more commonly encountered 
as a means of relating heat or energy input to temperature. Heat capacities are frequently expressed as 
polynomial relationships of the form:
ܥ௉= ܽ൅ܾܶേܿܶଶ
Where the values of a, b and c are taken from the tables mentioned above. Conveniently, simple 
relationships exist between CP and CV. For liquids and solids CP is approximately the same as CV, and 
for an ideal gas CP is equal to CV corrected by the value of the gas constant, such that CP = CV + R. For 
non-ideal gases, the relationship is more complex and is not discussed here.

Thus the enthalpy of a substance at any temperature T can be calculated with respect to a particular 
reference temperature, TR, using values tabulated in the literature at different temperatures. Each table is 
based on one particular reference temperature and all enthalpy calculations will relate to this particular 
reference temperature. Mean heat capacities can be used to calculate the enthalpy change involved in 
heating a substance generally from any temperature, Ta, to a second temperature, Tb:

Heat Capacity and Latent Heat Data for Different Substances
For greatest accuracy, wherever possible actual experimental heat capacities and latent heat data should 
be used in energy calculations. If information is not directly available, there are methods that may be 
used to estimate the data required, for heat capacities these include the Law of Dulong and Petit (solids), 
Kopp’s rule (solids or liquids), the Fallon and Watson equation (liquid hydrocarbons) and the Ideal gas 
equation (gases); latent heat of fusion divided by the melting point equals a constant (2–3 for elements; 
5–7 for inorganic compounds; and 9–11 for organic compounds); several methods are available to 
estimate the heat of vaporisation, including Trouton’s rule, as the heat divided by normal boiling point

equals a constant (21 for non-polar liquids, and 26 for water and lower alcohols), Kistyakowski equation 
(for non-polar liquids), Clausius-Clapeyron equation, reference substance plots, such as Duhrig plot, 
Othmer plot or Gordon plot, and lastly the Watson equation.
Enthalpy
Enthalpy is basically a measure of heat content and can be determined using heat capacities (covered 
above), however, enthalpy is not an absolute quantity and must be calculated relative to some chosen 
set of reference conditions and take any phase changes into account. So in enthalpy calculations, it is 
essential to state the reference conditions, including temperature and state.
Steam Tables
Over many years, the physical properties of water have been recorded in steam tables, serving as standard 
references for chemical engineers. The reference state of the tables is liquid water at 0 ºC. When using 
steam tables to calculate enthalpies, these reference conditions should be observed or the values adjusted 
to comply with alternative reference conditions. As water is a common substance, the enthalpy of liquid 
water is well documented and any required values can usually be lifted directly from steam tables.
Any phase transition(s) taking place between the desired temperature and the reference temperature must 
take into account as latent heat(s) of the phase change(s). These corrections are added to the sensible 
heat changes calculated from the specific heat capacities, with contributions from the heat capacity 
calculation below the phase change and a second above it, such that:

Where LH is the enthalpy associated with the change of phase, TP is the phase transition temperature and 
CP1 and CP2 are the specific heat capacity contributions for the phases below TP and above TP, respectively.
Enthalpy Changes Involving Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions are associated with large enthalpy changes where energy is either released into 
or absorbed from the environment. The heat involved is called the heat of reaction (or enthalpy of 
reaction), and is denoted by ΔHR. A negative value for ΔHR indicates energy is released and the process 
is exothermic, on the contrary a positive value assigned to ΔHR denotes energy is absorbed and the 
process is endothermic. Thus heats of reaction play a major role in economics of chemical processes. 
These heats can be calculated using Hess’s Law of Constant Summation, which depends on the use of 
stoichiometric proportions of reactants fed in to the system at temperature (T) and pressure (P), that the 
reaction proceeds to completion, and that the products emerge at the same temperature (T) and pressure 
(P). For any calculations involving incomplete reactions (or excess reactants), ΔHR should be based only 
on the amount of material actually taking part in the reaction. It has been mentioned previously, but 
is worth noting again that, at low and moderate pressure, ΔHɵ
R, is nearly independent of pressure but 
importantly the value of heat of reaction depends on the states of aggregation of reactants and products.
It should also be noted that temperature has a marked effect on the heat of reaction, and the temperature 
dependence of the heat of reaction can be described by Kirchhoff’s Law, which is based on the fact that 
enthalpy is a state function, hence, the final value of the heat of reaction is not a function of the route 
taken to evaluate it. This is best explained by an example, consider the reaction:
Reactants → Products
Within an enthalpy pathway, the enthalpy change due to chemical reaction can be determined from 
either of two paths shown in the figure below: 1 → 4 or 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
