Dedication
This one is for Ferras, Mark, Ellen, Sandy, Emily, Ryan, and my family.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Over the years, I have read a handful of For Dummies books. I am very proud
to now have the opportunity to contribute a book to the popular series. I
hope you, the reader, find this book helpful on your quest to become a pub-
lished author.
Thanks to Mike Lewis at Wiley for inviting me to work on this project. Thanks
also to Georgette Beatty, this book’s project editor, for her hard work and
guidance. The work of Carrie Burchfield (copy editor) and D. Patrick Miller
(technical editor) are also very much appreciated. Many people work
extremely hard to make the For Dummies series so successful. I’d like to offer
my sincere gratitude to everyone involved, including the editors, illustrators,
designers, proofreaders, reviewers, editorial supervisors, and the sales team.
This book truly is a team effort.
On a personal note, my never ending love and gratitude goes out to my close
friends — Ferras, Mark, and Ellen (as well as Ellen’s family), who are all
extremely important people in my life. I’d also like to thank my family for all
their support. (Congratulations to Ferras on signing a major record deal and
having the opportunity to pursue his dreams! I am so proud of you, Ferras!)

Self-Publishing For Dummies

Introduction
You may have personal and/or professional reasons why you want to get
published. Perhaps it’s to supplement your income or generate an entire
income as a writer. Maybe it’s because you have important information to
convey or a compelling story to tell.
For someone with good writing skills and a flair for putting words together in a
way that’s readily accessible to intended readers, becoming a freelance writer
for newspapers, magazines, Web sites, and other media outlets is certainly a
viable option. Becoming an author with a published book and working with a
major publishing house, however, continues to be much more of a challenge
due to the highly competitive nature of the book-publishing business.
In recent years, would-be authors have been given an entirely new way to
have their work professionally published in book form and then have it dis-
tributed to the general public. The process is called self-publishing. Self-
publishing is a fast-growing opportunity made available when new forms of
printing technologies, called digital printing and desktop publishing, were
perfected. Now, instead of having to print thousands of copies of a book at
one time, as few as one copy of a book can be printed at any given time.
The price to self-publish a book has also dropped dramatically in the past
few years. Now, publishing a book is extremely affordable for virtually
anyone. Never before has the opportunity to publish a professional quality
book been within reach of any aspiring author.
Self-Publishing For Dummies helps you take your idea for a book, develop the
idea into content to fill a full-length manuscript, and have it published. This
book describes the incredible opportunity self-publishing offers to aspiring
writers and authors, business leaders, entrepreneurs, consultants, and
anyone else with a great idea for a book.
About This Book
Self-publishing puts you in total charge of your publishing project. A success-
ful publishing venture means properly dealing with each step in the publish-
ing process. Without the proper knowledge and experience, costly mistakes
can easily be made. The information in this book helps you avoid the most
common mistakes made by authors and self-publishers and helps you prop-
erly cater your book to your intended readers. This book also lends a hand

when you gather a highly skilled publishing team for your venture. By hiring
freelance experts to help you with editing, design, layout, and marketing,
your book more effectively competes with the tens of thousands of other
books currently on the market.
Most importantly, this book shows you how to obtain distribution for your
book and properly market it in order to generate sales. Using marketing,
public relations, and advertising strategies, along with the power and capabil-
ities of the Internet, you can transform your book into a successful publishing
venture.
I’ve put the chapters in an order that makes sense if you’re looking to trans-
form your manuscript into a self-published book. However, each chapter
focuses on one important aspect of the self-publishing process, so you can
jump around to quickly obtain the specific information that you’re looking
for. For instance: Check out Chapter 11 for the scoop on Print-On-Demand
(POD) and finding a reputable POD publisher. If you’re looking to put together
press materials for your book, skip ahead to Chapter 18. Want to know more
about what an ISBN is and how to obtain one for your book? Check out
Chapter 7.
Keep in mind that this book isn’t a “how to write a book” book or an “improve
your writing skills” book. Developing the writing skills and the necessary
expertise on the topic you plan to write about is your responsibility. If you
need to brush up on your writing skills, I recommend that you sign up for writ-
ing classes or workshops. This book helps you take the manuscript you’ve
written or are about to write and transform it into the best book possible.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use a few conventions to help guide you through this book:
 Italic words point out defined terms or emphasize words.
 Boldface text indicates keywords in bulleted lists and the action part of
numbered steps.
 Monofont text highlights Web addresses.
Each chapter of Self-Publishing For Dummies focuses on one important 
aspect of the self-publishing process. Within each chapter, you find many
useful resources and companies that provide products or services for self-
published authors. Keep in mind that the companies listed within this 
book are only a sampling of what’s available. Feel free to shop around and
research other companies or services before deciding whom to work with.
Also, expect the prices associated with self-publishing to change as digital
printing options become cheaper, more competition enters into the business,
and a greater number of options become available to perspective authors.

Self-Publishing For Dummies 

What You’re Not to Read
In many chapters, sidebars (formatted in gray boxes) are used to further
explain certain topics or to provide interviews with various experts in their
field. These interviews are designed to provide additional insight into specific
steps in the publishing process, but reading them isn’t essential to getting
your book published. Therefore, if you’re in an incredible hurry (and self-
publishers can be extremely busy people!), the sidebars are informative 
but can be skipped over.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I’ve made a few assumptions. I know, making assump-
tions isn’t always the best idea, but in developing the content for this book, I
had to start somewhere. Here are my assumptions:
 You have basic writing skills and a great idea for a book. Self-Publishing
For Dummies helps you evaluate your idea in terms of its suitability and
marketability.
 You already have information to convey to your readers, whether it’s a
good story or valuable and informative content. Sure, this book helps
you fine-tune your approach when it comes to communicating your con-
tent to your readers, but it’s up to you to decide what information to
include in your book, based on your book’s target audience.
 You may even have already written a book, and you want to bypass the
traditional publishing process and do it yourself. Or perhaps you’ve
already approached major publishers to sell your book without success,
and now you want to give self-publishing a whirl. If you already have
written your manuscript, this book shows you how to publish it, market
it, and make it available to its intended audience.
How This Book Is Organized
You need to complete many steps to ensure that your publishing venture is
successful. This book is organized to help you find specific information
easily. Each of the book’s six parts is devoted to a particular topic and con-
tains several chapters covering information that directly relates to that topic.
3
Introduction

Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started 
with Self-Publishing
The first part of this book introduces you to self-publishing, explains what it
is, and clarifies how self-publishing can be used to publish your book. You
read about the pros and cons of self-publishing and discover if it’s the right
publishing option for you. This part also helps you gather all the tools you
need to write and publish your book, while providing you with basic informa-
tion about developing and fine-tuning your manuscript.
Part II: Pulling Together the Details:
Administration and Design
After you’ve finished writing your full-length manuscript, a lot of work is still
necessary before it’s ready to be printed and sold. This part focuses on set-
ting up your own self-publishing business and handling the book-specific
tasks necessary before your book goes to press. Part II also focuses on taking
your book’s manuscript and creating a professional layout and design for its
interior and delving into what it takes to create the best possible front and
back cover.
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining
Printing Choices
As a self-published author, you have a handful of options when printing your
books. Which option you choose is best determined by a number of factors:
your budget, your ultimate goals for the book, your distribution plan, and
your audience. Each chapter in this part focuses on a different printing
option, such as offset printing, Print-On-Demand (POD), and eBook publish-
ing. I also show you how to work successfully with any printer.
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller:
Distribution Methods
Simply writing and publishing a book isn’t enough to make it successful. One
of your biggest challenges is getting your book into the hands of potential
4
Self-Publishing For Dummies 

readers. You have a few options to distribute your book: selling your book
online, distributing through booksellers, and marketing to other retail stores.
This part focuses on different book distribution methods and how to best uti-
lize each. I also discuss how to handle your own warehousing, order fulfill-
ment, and shipping, and I explain how to gain even wider distribution for
your book by choosing to sell it to a major publisher.
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and
Marketing
Being able to inform readers that your book exists means the difference
between selling thousands or tens of thousands of copies (or not selling any
copies at all). Developing a comprehensive advertising, marketing, and public
relations campaign and then properly implementing it requires a financial
and time investment, plus a tremendous amount of creativity, planning, and
initiative.
Whether you have a few hundred dollars or an unlimited budget to properly
market your book, this part shows you how to utilize the media to generate
positive reviews and editorial coverage and how to create effective advertise-
ments. You also discover how to use the Internet to reach your book’s target
audience and how to develop spinoff products from your book.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this part, you discover how to avoid ten common mistakes self-published
authors make and find a variety of resources where you can obtain additional
information and guidance as you embark on your book publishing venture.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons used throughout this book help you quickly pinpoint important
information, focus your attention on information that’s worth remembering,
and draw attention to things you should watch out for and avoid as you start
your publishing project.
This icon appears when I convey information worth remembering. Sounds
simple enough, right?

Where to Go from Here
For an overview of what self-publishing is all about and to determine the best
way to get started, Chapter 1 is definitely the best place to begin reading.
Never before has the opportunity to publish a professional-looking book 
been available to so many people at such an affordable price. After you’ve
written your manuscript, by following the advice offered in this book, you
can become a published author in a matter of weeks and begin selling your
book. If you have something important, relevant, or entertaining to say, self-
publishing is a viable option for distributing your message to the public.

Do It Yourself:
Getting 
Started with 
Self-Publishing

In this part . . .
You’ve heard the phrase self-publishing, but what does
it really mean? This part offers an introduction to
self-publishing and helps you get your publishing project
off the ground. I tell you about the pros and cons of self-
publishing and explain how to equip yourself to start the
writing process. I also give you the lowdown on assem-
bling a winning manuscript and editing it carefully.

Chapter 1
Welcome to Self-Publishing!
In This Chapter
 Determining whether self-publishing is right for you
 Creating and editing your manuscript
 Diving into administration and design tasks
 Choosing the right printing option
 Distributing and promoting your new book
 Checking out a brief self-publishing timeline
D
o you have expertise that other people can benefit from? Do you want
to share an amazing story? Do you have basic writing skills and a good
command of the English language? Do you have the discipline to write a full-
length manuscript? If you answered yes to at least two of these questions,
you may have the “write stuff” to become a published author. But there’s one
problem: Many major book publishing companies aren’t willing to work with
first-time authors with little or no writing experience. In the past, this fact
could’ve kept you from achieving your dream of becoming a published
author but not anymore!
Thanks to new digital printing technologies anyone with good writing skills
and a great idea for content can have a book professionally published and
made available to the general public. The process is called self-publishing.
Self-publishing offers many awesome benefits and allows ordinary people,
business leaders, celebrities, entrepreneurs, educators, students, retired
people, stay-at-home moms, and just about anyone else to become a pub-
lished author for a relatively low financial investment. What’s required, how-
ever, is a tremendous amount of time, creativity, and discipline to write, edit,
design, publish, promote, distribute, and sell your book (that is, if you want it
to be successful, and who doesn’t want to be successful?).
This chapter provides an overview of what becoming a self-published author
involves. The rest of this book takes you step-by-step through the entire
self-publishing process. By the time you’re done reading Self-Publishing For
Dummies, you can put your knowledge and ideas into writing and have them
published in book form.

Figuring Out Whether Self-Publishing 
Is the Best Option for You
When you get hired as an author by a major publishing house, your job is to
write the book’s manuscript and perhaps gather some or all the artwork
that’s included within that book. For this work, you’re typically paid an
advance and a royalty on book sales. Various experts working for the pub-
lisher handle all the other steps (and there are many of them) in the publish-
ing process.
Self-publishing is different. As the author, you’re still responsible for writing
your book’s manuscript, but you’re also responsible for every other aspect of
the book publishing process. (Don’t worry; as you delve into the self-publishing
process, you’re able to hire a wide range of freelancers and companies to
handle some of the major steps in the publishing process, but you ultimately
are the decision maker and person in charge of the project.)
In Chapter 2, you find out specifically why you should consider self-publishing,
and you discover the benefits of the process. Chapter 2 also reveals how just
about any type of content, fiction or nonfiction, can be self-published and
transformed into a paperback or hardcover book. You also find out the spe-
cific skills you need to become a self-published author.
Don’t get too excited just yet! Self-publishing does offer an amazing opportu-
nity for just about anyone to have their book professionally published.
However, compared to having your book published by a major publishing
company, self-publishing has some drawbacks as well (covered in Chapter 2).
Gathering the Right Publishing Tools
Before you sit down to write your potential bestseller, gather the proper writ-
ing and publishing tools. Chapter 3 focuses on what you need to write a book
with success. Some prewriting tasks you need to accomplish include
 Creating a comfortable writing environment
 Identifying and minimizing distractions when you’re writing
 Putting together the perfect writer’s toolbox
10
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

As an author, you need certain tools to make the writing process easier and
to be able to maximize your productivity. A desktop or laptop computer
that’s equipped with a powerful word processor (such as Microsoft Word)
and that has access to the Internet and a printer can be your most important
tools, unless you plan to write the first draft of your book freehand, using a
pad and pen. (If you do this, expect to wind up with a very tired hand!)
Putting Together a Winning Manuscript
The beauty of self-publishing is that almost any type of content can be 
transformed into a professionally published book. Depending on the type of
book you’re writing, a full-length manuscript may be anywhere from 50,000 
to 100,000 words (or longer). There are plenty of exceptions, however. A chil-
dren’s book may contain 500 or fewer words, but a compilation of poems or
short stories or a photo book or a cookbook containing recipes may all follow
different formats altogether.
The trick to writing a successful book is carefully defining your book’s audi-
ence and then making sure that the content of your book (and later all the
marketing for it) targets that same specific audience. I explain how to deter-
mine your target audience in Chapter 4.
Coming up with the perfect book idea — something that’s unique or that offers
a new twist on something that’s been written about before — is an important
step in the book writing and publishing process. Equally important is research-
ing your information and making sure that you have enough interesting and
informative content to fill a book. The information then needs to be properly
organized so it makes sense and is useful to the reader.
Most authors begin the writing process by creating a detailed outline for
their book before they actually start researching, writing, and adding visual
elements like photos and illustrations. Chapter 4 focuses on how to prepare
an outline, research the content for your book, and decide what elements 
you want to incorporate into your manuscript.
Editing Your Work Effectively
After writing the book, it’s time to edit. This process includes correcting
spelling and grammatical mistakes, ensuring that the content is well organized
and comprehensive, and doing some fine-tuning to ensure that the book 
properly targets its audience. At this stage in the publishing process, you
11
Chapter 1: Welcome to Self-Publishing!

may want to hire a freelance editor to review your manuscript. Even best-
selling authors use professional editors to fine-tune their work before it’s
published.
The editing process requires several steps. It’s an excellent strategy to begin
by editing your own work and then hiring a professional editor to fine-tune
the manuscript. In Chapter 5, find out what a professional editor does and
how to hire someone who’s highly skilled. Editing requires a very different
skill set than writing, and people train for years to learn how to edit well.
Dealing with Administration and Design
Depending on what your goals are for your book, some self-published
authors establish their own small publishing company (a formal business
entity), especially if they plan to directly sell and distribute their book.
Discover in Chapter 6 why forming a company can be beneficial.
Even without establishing your own publishing company, as a self-published
author, some administrative tasks need to be completed before your book
goes to press. For example, all books need an ISBN, a Library of Congress
Card Number, and a copyright notice. Chapter 7 outlines many of these tasks.
Many companies that offer comprehensive publishing solutions for self-
published authors, including Print-On-Demand (POD) publishers (described
in Chapter 11), can handle some or all these administrative tasks on your
behalf. Using one of these comprehensive publishing solutions is helpful to
first-time authors because the service makes the whole process easier and
saves you considerable time and money.
In addition to the many administrative tasks that must be completed before a
book gets published, the manuscript must be laid out and designed, and the
book’s front and back cover need to be created. These steps you can handle
yourself, using desktop publishing and graphic design software, or you can
hire a professional graphic designer to do this design work for you.
Graphic design is a skill that takes tremendous creativity, artistic flair, and
training and experience. For your book to look as professional as possible,
consider hiring an experienced graphic designer to handle your book’s 
interior layout and design and to design your book’s front and back cover.
Chapter 8 focuses on how to design and lay out the interior of your book,
using desktop publishing software, such as InDesign CS2, QuarkXPress, or
Microsoft Publisher. Chapter 9 provides the information you need to create
the most impressive and high-impact front and back cover possible.
12
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Checking Out Your Printing Options
Published books come in all shapes and sizes. You have a handful of options
when it comes to actually printing your book:
 Traditional printing options involve using offset printing technology to
publish a large quantity of books at one time. This process is used by
major publishing houses and offers many advantages but also a few
drawbacks for self-published authors. See Chapter 10 for more details.
 Print-On-Demand (POD) has become the most viable publishing option
for the majority of self-published authors (despite some small draw-
backs). POD requires a relatively low initial financial investment and
requires the author to maintain little or no inventory. For all the benefits
and drawbacks of PODs, see Chapter 11.
 eBooks are another popular form of published material. Chapter 12
delves into how and why you may want to publish your book as an
eBook and how you can potentially use a local print shop to photocopy
and bind your book for small print runs.
Before choosing which printing and publishing option is right for you, con-
sider your goals, your distribution plan, and your budget of your book. (Keep
in mind that marketing, advertising, and promoting your book also requires a
significant investment.)
No matter which printing and publishing option you choose, you should
develop a good rapport with the company you work with. Chapter 13 focuses
on how to develop a good rapport with any printer.
Delving into Distribution
As a self-published author, one of your biggest challenges (besides writing
the book) is to get it into the hands of readers. You can sell your book in
many ways; the trick is to find distribution methods that work best for your
book and allow you to achieve your sales goals. Here are some methods:
 Online booksellers: In Chapter 14, you find out about distribution
through online booksellers, like Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com,
which for many self-published authors is the most viable and inexpen-
sive way of making a book available to the general public.
 Retail distribution: Chapter 15 focuses on traditional distribution through
retail booksellers and other specialty retailers. You find out about working
with wholesalers and distributors, independent bookstores, specialty
retail stores, direct mail, and professional organizations.
13
Chapter 1: Welcome to Self-Publishing!

When you try to distribute your book through major retailers, you may be
competing head-on with the major publishing companies that are supported
by teams of professional salespeople who’ve well-developed connections to
key buyers at the various retailers. You may be at a disadvantage in this situ-
ation, but as you can see in Chapter 15, your book can find its way onto the
shelves of major bookstore chains and mass-market retailers.
If you plan to sell your own book to distributors, wholesalers, retailers, book-
sellers, or individual consumers, you need to deal with warehousing, order
fulfillment, and shipping. Chapter 16 provides an overview of what’s required
when it comes to distributing your book.
After achieving some level of success as a self-published author, many people
team up with a major publishing house to obtain nationwide distribution
through the major bookstore chains and other retailers. For some self-published
authors, approaching a major publishing house is a viable option. The benefits
of working with a major publisher are explored in Chapter 17.
Getting the Word Out with 
Publicity and Marketing
Your book may not sell no matter how good it is unless you develop a com-
prehensive, effective, and well-timed marketing, publicity, and advertising
campaign to reach and convince your intended audience. The following ele-
ments are a few successful publicity and marketing campaigns:
 Generating free publicity in all forms of media (radio, television, newspa-
pers, magazines, newsletters, and the Internet) is one of the most power-
ful and cost-effective ways for self-publishers to generate awareness of
their book. If handled correctly, public awareness can be transformed
directly into book sales.
In Chapter 18, I cover how to develop the publicity materials you need
to promote your book properly. I cover items such as the press kit
folder, press release, author bio, author photo, and pitch letter. Chapter
19 focuses on how to use those materials to generate media reviews,
articles, and features about your book.
 Another way to educate potential readers about your book is through
paid advertising. Advertising allows you to distribute your exact market-
ing message through appropriate media outlets. Chapter 20 covers how
to create effective ads to promote and sell your book.
14
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

 The Internet offers you the opportunity to utilize cost-effective niche
marketing techniques to easily target your book’s intended audience.
Tapping the incredible power of the Internet to promote your book is
the focus of Chapter 21.
Whether your book sells for $9.95 or $29.95, your profit potential is ultimately
limited because the book itself is a low-priced item compared to most other
products with higher profit margins. Self-published authors need to use the
recognition and credibility they receive as a published author and repackage
their book’s content into other, higher-priced items, such as DVDs and audio
books. Many self-published authors also generate additional revenues by lec-
turing and hosting seminars or training programs relating to their book’s
topic. How to generate additional revenue streams from the content of your
book is covered in Chapter 22.
Surveying a Brief Self-Publishing
Timeline
Self-publishing your book isn’t a fast and easy project. Plan on investing con-
siderable time into each step of the process, especially when it comes to
actually writing the manuscript.
Unfortunately, determining how long it takes you to sit down and write the
full-length manuscript for your book is impossible until you actually begin
writing and understanding more about your personal work habits as a writer.
For some people, the researching and writing process takes weeks. For
others, it takes months or years. After you’ve completed your manuscript,
you can more accurately calculate a production timeline for your book, based
on the printing and publishing decisions you make.
Here is a rough timeline of tasks to handle after you finish writing the 
manuscript:
❑Establish your publishing company (if applicable).
❑Have the manuscript edited.
❑Choose a self-publishing option, such as offset printing or POD, and then
hire a printer and/or publisher.
❑Apply for an ISBN, copyright, and other book-specific information, if nec-
essary (this step may be handled for you, depending on the publishing
process you choose and the company you work with).
15
Chapter 1: Welcome to Self-Publishing!

❑Set the cover price for your book.
❑Select a publication date.
❑Have the manuscript’s interior pages designed and laid out.
❑Hire a graphic designer and create your book’s front and back covers.
❑Develop press materials for your book.
❑Plan and implement a comprehensive marketing, public relations, and
advertising campaign.
❑Develop a Web site to promote your book.
❑Begin pre-selling your book (pre-selling includes putting together and
sending out press materials, promoting the book to distributors, lining
up booksellers to sell the book, taking out ads, and so on).
❑Have your book listed with online retailers.
❑Publish the book and ship it to consumers, booksellers, retailers, and
distributors (as appropriate).
❑Continue promoting and marketing your book as you take orders.
As you develop your timeline, allocate ample time for each step of the pub-
lishing process to wind up with the best possible finished product. For exam-
ple, a professional editor may take several weeks to edit your manuscript. It
can then take a professional graphic designer at least a week or two to create
a professional front and back cover (potentially longer), and additional time
may be needed to do the layout and design work necessary for your book’s
interior.
As you read each chapter of this book, consider how long each step in the
process may take you, based on your unique lifestyle, responsibilities, 
and personal situation. Make sure that the timeline and deadlines you set 
for yourself are realistic, using the time estimates you read about in each
chapter. Stay focused on your goals and deadlines, and work hard to 
achieve them!
After the manuscript is complete, with proper planning, you can potentially
have it professionally published in as little as two to three months. Just think,
in 60 to 90 days, you can be a published author!

Understanding the Pros and 
Cons of Self-Publishing
In This Chapter
 Considering self-publishing as an option for your book
 Looking at the benefits and potential drawbacks
 Surveying the skills that self-published authors need
 Wondering whether becoming a full-time self-published writer is right for you
S
o, you’ve decided to write a book. You have a great idea for content, you
know your topic, and you’ve pinpointed your targeted audience. Or per-
haps you’ve already written the manuscript that you believe has the potential
to sell well. Now, you need to make a big decision. Are you going to approach
major publishing houses in hopes of getting them to publish, distribute, and
market your book, or do you plan to self-publish?
Thanks to a variety of recent technological developments in printing and 
distribution, self-publishing has become a more viable and cost-effective
option than ever before. This chapter explores the pros and cons of self-
publishing and helps you decide if publishing your own book is the right
decision for you.
Why Should You Even Consider 
Self-Publishing?
Pursuing a traditional route for getting your book published may not be possi-
ble. It doesn’t mean that you can’t or shouldn’t pursue your goal of getting
your book written, published, and distributed, but self-publishing offers you —
the author — a variety of benefits and significantly greater creative control
over your project. Check out the additional reasons why you should consider
self-publishing:

 Competition in the traditional book publishing industry has become
extremely fierce. Tens of thousands of books are published every year
and distributed through major retail stores, but only a small fraction of
those books actually become bestsellers and earn a significant profit for
the publishers and authors.
 Getting the attention of a major publishing house is hard. Even if writ-
ers develop a well-written proposal and are represented by a well-known
literary agent, the chances of publication are still slim.
Unfortunately, it’s likely that many potential bestsellers get passed over
by the publishing houses, either because a proposal was one of thou-
sands received that didn’t get the proper attention, or because the 
publisher didn’t have the resources to take the gamble involved with
publishing a book by an unknown author.
 You have 100-percent control over your publishing project. This con-
trol even includes what content goes in your book. You don’t have to
answer to editors, a publisher, a publishing company’s sales or market-
ing department, or anyone else when developing your book’s content.
 You can set your own schedule. Decide when you want to write, edit,
publish, market, and sell your own book. You can fast-track the project
and make it available to the public within a few short weeks or months,
or you can take your time and handle each step of the publishing process
at your leisure. You aren’t tied to deadlines imposed by a major publish-
ing house.
Is self-publishing right for you? Maybe you need a checklist of sorts to see if
you fall under the criteria for becoming a self-published author. Well, I’ve pro-
vided a list below. How convenient! Self-publishing your book may be the
ideal solution for you, if the following criteria apply:
 You’re a first-time author looking to publish, market, and distribute your
book, but you can’t get the attention of a major publisher.
 You’re a business professional or expert in your field and want to use a
published book as a marketing tool to enhance your professional credi-
bility and reputation.
 You’re an established author who wants 100-percent creative control
over your next book project, and you want to make more money per
copy sold than you would working with a major publisher.
 You want to put information in book form, such as your autobiography or
family genealogy, and distribute it to a small group of friends and family.
 You represent a company that needs to develop book-length publica-
tions or manuals in-house.
18
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

 You work with a group or association and need to create a fundraising
item, such as a cookbook or yearbook, that’s sold to raise money and/or
is distributed to members.
 You own the rights to republish a currently out-of-print book that you
believe still has a viable market.
Before making the decision to pursue self-publishing, though, make sure that
you review the potential drawbacks, which are outlined later in this chapter.
For the author, self-publishing requires a much greater time commitment
(above and beyond just writing the book’s manuscript), a lot more work, and
a financial investment.
What Are the Benefits 
of Self-Publishing?
Some of the biggest benefits of self-publishing include
 Having the ability to publish any type of content
 Maintaining total control over your entire project, including all creative
control over the manuscript, cover design, and marketing of your book
 Saving time because the time it takes to self-publish a book can be signif-
icantly faster than working with a major publishing house
 Earning significantly highly royalties per copy of your book sold
 Keeping money in your pocket because you don’t have to hire a literary
agent to help you market your book
You may decide that approaching the major publishing houses, after finding
out about the benefits of self-publishing in the following sections, isn’t some-
thing that you want to do. You don’t want to risk potential rejection and have
to give up a lot of control over your project in order to get your manuscript
published, so the self-publishing option may be more worth it for you.
After you decide that self-publishing is the right direction to go with your
book project, you need to determine the most cost-effective and viable print-
ing option that’s based on your needs, goals, and budget. Part III of this book
focuses on actually printing and publishing your manuscript using traditional
printing methods, Print-On-Demand (POD) technology, eBook publishing, and
local print shops.

Chapter 2: Understanding the Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing

Self-publish any type of content
No matter what type of book or the content of your book that you’re looking
to write and get published, chances are self-publishing is your answer. Thanks
to the U.S. Constitution and the Amendments, the United States has freedom
of speech and freedom of the press. If there’s a topic that may be considered
too controversial or edgy for a major publishing house, through self-publishing
you have total control over the content of your book.
Although your book may not be controversial, its target audience may be too
narrow for a major publishing house to consider sales worthy. Yet, if you
know exactly how to market your book to your intended audience, publishing
your book can become a profitable endeavor. (Check out Part V for the full
scoop on publicity and marketing.)
Through self-publishing, you can publish any type of content. The possibili-
ties are truly endless. Here are some of the common topics or genres authors
have had success with through self-publishing:
 Autobiographies or biographies
 Children’s books (fiction or nonfiction)
 Collection of artwork, drawings, or paintings
 Collection of poems or essays
 Cookbooks or a collection of recipes
 How-to books
 Reference books or textbooks
 Training manuals or guidebooks
 Works of fiction, such as a full-length novel or collection of short stories
in any genre (horror, sci-fi, romance, comedy, adventure, erotica, and 
so on)
Self-publishing gives virtually anyone the ability to become a published
author to share ideas, knowledge, experience, or creativity in a variety of 
formats. These books can then be distributed through almost any type of 
distribution channel including bookstores, retail stores, mail orders, and
online (see Part IV for more about book distribution). And not only does self-
publishing allow you to publish any type of content, but also it allows you to
cost-effectively publish any number of copies of your book.
20
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Maintain control over the entire process
When you publish your own book, you wear both the author and the pub-
lisher hats. You’re ultimately responsible for handling all the work that a
major publishing house typically handles on behalf of authors:
 Getting the manuscript edited
 Creating page layouts and design
 Crafting a front and back cover
 Getting the book printed
 Distributing your the book
 Managing marketing, advertising, and promotion
(What, you’re not an expert in all these areas? Well, you’re in luck once again.
Every step is covered in this book!)
Authors who work with a major publishing house must give up a lot of cre-
ative control over their book project. It’s the author’s job to write the manu-
script. The publisher typically handles everything else, often without
consulting the author on creative decisions. Authors who have their book
published by a major publishing house don’t typically get a say on cover
design or how their book is marketed or promoted.
By self-publishing your book, you’re the boss. You can hire freelancers and
consultants to help you edit, design, publish, distribute, and market your
book, but ultimately, you’re responsible for making all the creative and busi-
ness decisions. So, if you’re emotionally close to your book and don’t want
anyone taking away your ability to make creative decisions, self-publishing
offers you a great opportunity to get your book published on your terms.
Taking on total control of your entire book project requires you to make a
wide range of business decisions that impact the sales success and profitabil-
ity of your book. You’re responsible for the financial investment needed to
print, distribute, advertise, market, and promote your book. See “What Are
Self-Publishing’s Drawbacks?” later in this chapter.
Quickly get your book into 
the hands of readers
Bringing a book to print yourself can happen significantly faster than if you
were working with a major publisher. By self-publishing your book, you have
the flexibility to set your own schedule and deadlines, without having to
21
Chapter 2: Understanding the Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing

cater to the needs or demands of a major publishing company. You can dedi-
cate the time and effort needed to write, edit, and publish your book in a few
weeks or months, or you can take your time and complete each step of the
publishing process at your own convenience. You set your own schedule,
based on other personal and professional demands on your life.
When you work with a major publisher, bringing your book to print can take
up to two years. Using many self-publishing techniques, such as POD or
eBook (see Chapters 11 and 12), the process (after the manuscript is fully
written) can take just a few weeks.
Achieve your career-related goals
Some people write books because they want to pursue writing as a career.
(Check out “Can Self-Publishing Be a Full-Time Gig?” later in this chapter for
more about this career option.) Others, however, use their work to promote
other aspects of their established career.
After you become a published author, you instantly become a credible
“expert” on whatever topic you wrote about. People respect authors and the
knowledge they share. Therefore, being a published author can help you
 Land a new job in your area of expertise
 Earn a raise or promotion with your current employer
 Launch or expand your own business and earn the respect of customers
 Become a consultant or freelancer in your area of expertise
 Earn extra money lecturing or teaching seminars on your book’s topic
 Be the media’s go-to person whenever a news story breaks about your
topic
 Pursue writing as a full-time career, assuming you’re able to sell enough
books or write enough articles for newspapers and magazines to earn a
living
In addition, after your book publishes, it can be used as a powerful marketing
tool for yourself and/or your company. The book serves as a resume or busi-
ness card for promoting yourself as an expert in your field and helps you
pursue your professional goals.
Depending on how you utilize your book as a marketing tool, the profits you
generate from actual book sales can be insignificant compared to the boost 
in income from generated new business because potential clients and cus-
tomers were able to find you as a result of reading your book or being
exposed to publicity about your book.
22
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Many self-published authors use their book as a promotional or marketing
tool and give away free copies of their book to potential and existing clients.
Wouldn’t you consider giving away a book that costs between $5 and $10 per
copy if you could generate hundreds or thousands of dollars in new revenue?
Published authors who have a proven track record can earn a significantly
higher income and become a recognized expert in their field (compared to
other in their professions who haven’t written a book). The recognition and
respect you receive as a published author can be extremely valuable.
Earn more royalties
Major publishers typically pay authors a recoupable advance, plus a pre-
determined royalty on book sales as compensation. Writers who self-publish
their books, however, must cover all their project’s development, printing,
distribution, and marketing costs out-of-pocket. The profit potential, how-
ever, can be significantly greater.
Instead of receiving a 25-cent, 50-cent, or even a dollar royalty for each copy
of your book sold, a self-published author can earn 40 to 60 percent of the
book’s cover price and sometimes even more. So, if your book sells for $15
per copy and you sell just 1,000 copies, the profit is between $6,000 and
$9,000.
Conversely, if you’re an author whose book is published by a major publish-
ing house, you earn only a 25-cent royalty per book. If that book only sells
1,000 copies, your earnings are a mere $250. As initial sales are generated
from your book, you potentially have to repay your outstanding advance to
the publisher. (If the book doesn’t sell, however, the advance doesn’t need to
be repaid.) Even if that’s been done, your literary agent often takes between
15 and 20 percent of your earnings as his commission (see the following sec-
tion, “Save money without a literary agent”). If the major publishing house
sells tens of thousands of copies of your book, as the author, you stand to
earn a decent income. This, however, doesn’t always happen.
Another benefit to self-publishing is that you don’t have to wait three to six
months to receive royalty checks from the publisher. Authors who have their
book published by a major publishing house often have to wait for the money
they’ve earned, but self-published authors tend to be paid a lot faster, espe-
cially on copies of the book they sell directly to customers. Self-published
authors also aren’t subject to a withholding of royalties as a reserve against
returns for up to six additional months.
23
Chapter 2: Understanding the Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing

As a self-publisher you stand to earn more money per copy of your book
sold, but it’s also considerably harder, but not impossible, for self-publishers
to get distribution in major bookstores. So you need to develop innovative
ways to market and sell your book. Part V helps you kick start your public
relations, marketing, and advertising efforts.
Save money without a literary agent
A literary agent is compensated by the author and typically receives a 
commission of between 15 to 20 percent of the author’s revenues. As a self-
published author, you don’t need to work with a literary agent, which saves
you money and gives you greater control over your entire book project.
The job of a literary agent is to help an author sell his book idea to a pub-
lisher, negotiate publishing contracts, and ensure that the author receives
timely royalty payments from the publishing house. Not having proper repre-
sentation by a literary agent keeps many authors from being noticed by
major publishers.
Keep in mind that if you want to sell your self-published book to a major pub-
lisher down the road, you may benefit from hiring an agent. Also, most of the
major publishing houses now require their authors to be represented by an
established literary agent. But the choice is up to you. See Chapter 17 for
details on selling your book the major publishers.
What Are Self-Publishing’s Drawbacks?
Although many reasons exist for wanting to self-publish your book (see the
previous section), a few drawbacks exist, too, when committing yourself to
this type of publishing venture. These cons include large time and cost con-
siderations, specific distribution issues, and finding professionals to help you
produce the best book possible. I discuss them in the following sections.
Recognizing the time and costs involved
Having total control of the publishing process can be a double-edged sword,
but from a creative standpoint, it can be liberating. Practically speaking, the
time and financial commitment may be too much for you.
24
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

 Time commitment: Although all authors have to invest the time and
energy to actually write the manuscript for their book, self-published
authors also have to invest the time needed to edit, layout and design,
print, market, advertise, promote, sell, and distribute their book. Each 
of these steps is vitally important in the success of a book, and each
requires a time commitment on your part. If you’re willing to write a self-
published book but not prepared to invest the time necessary to pro-
mote and sell it, nobody will know that your book exists, and your sales
may be minimal. The more time and energy you invest in marketing,
advertising, promotions, and sales, the better your chances are of selling
large quantities of books and generating high profits.
 Financial considerations: From a financial standpoint, all the costs asso-
ciated with the publishing process become your responsibility as a self-
published author. Depending on the approach you take, this expense
can be anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars.
The goal, however, is to invest money in marketing and advertising that
generates higher sales for your book and results in higher profits. If all
goes well, the investment you make offers a high return.
After you make the decision to self-publish, you must develop a plan to
handle each major task or responsibility as both the author and the pub-
lisher. If you have the time, resources, and finances to handle all aspects 
of the self-publishing process, you’re in excellent shape. However, if you’re
not equipped to handle even one aspect and you don’t have the financial
resources to hire experienced professionals to assist you (and save some of
your own time), your potential for achieving success can diminish dramati-
cally. See “Hiring all the help you want and need” later in this chapter for
more information on hiring help.
Some of the popular ready-to-use self-publishing solutions, especially those
that offer POD services (described in Chapter 11), can help you organize your
publishing process. These services handle
 Basic layout and design
 Cover design
 ISBN number registration
 Hiring a professional editor to review your manuscript
In Chapter 6, you also see many of the business-related expenses in the
budget as you set up your publishing company and begin making plans to
write, publish, promote, distribute, and sell your book. Having your own 
company can have significant tax advantages and ultimately save you a 
lot of money and give you and your book additional credibility.
25
Chapter 2: Understanding the Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing

Encountering specific distribution snags
If you compare a self-published book with a trade paperback book published
by a major publishing house, you may find many similarities in your book
and any other book you’d see displayed on a bookstore’s shelf (that’s if you
follow the advice offered in this book and create a professional looking book).
In fact, you’d probably have a difficult time differentiating between the two
products if you saw them side-by-side. Both a self-published book and a book
published by a major publishing house follow the same basic format, includ-
ing overall layout and design, front and back cover, how the title, price, bar-
code, and other information is conveyed, and the publishing materials used,
such as the cover and internal paper stock.
But a difference does exist: The big difference between a self-published book
and a book published by the major publishing house is the resources avail-
able for distribution, marketing, advertising, and promotion. The major pub-
lishers have fully-staffed and experienced people handling all these areas.
They also have established distribution with the major bookstore chains. 
As a self-publisher, you may not have these resources at your disposal.
As a self-published author, you can have your book listed with Amazon.com
or Barnes & Noble.com’s Web site to sell your books. Chapter 14 explains
how to work with these online distributors and retailers.
Realistically, getting traditional bookstore distribution for a self-published
book, especially a book from a first-time author, however, is extremely diffi-
cult and often almost impossible. Major bookstore chains have buyers that
deal primarily with the major publishing houses. Unless you work with a dis-
tributor or sales representative with experience getting your books into
mainstream distribution, don’t count on bookstore or mass-market retail dis-
tribution for your book.
Realistically, although you could sell your book through independent book-
stores and specialty retailers, your sales, distribution, and marketing plan for
your book should include alternate distribution options. These options
include online sales, direct mail, and direct selling through your clients and
people who attend your lectures or author appearances. Part IV focuses on
how to distribute your self-published book effectively.
Make sure that your distribution expectations are realistic. You may have
trouble obtaining national or international bookstore distribution for your
self-published book. Some of the most successful self-published authors 
have a pre-existing way to reach their target audience. Plan on grassroots
marketing to sell your book. This marketing plan includes
 Direct mail
 Existing customers or clients
26
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

 Extensive PR campaigning
 Online marketing
 Students
Hiring all the help you want and need
As you read Self-Publishing For Dummies, you discover the responsibilities of
a self-published author. To maximize your success in creating, publishing,
distributing, and selling your book, seriously consider hiring experienced
professionals in the book publishing industry.
Although the publisher or printing company you use to self-publish your
book offers a variety of services to you (see Part III for details on printing 
services), consider hiring the following types of freelance professionals to
help you with various aspects of the self-publishing process:
 Ghostwriter: This person helps you actually write your manuscript (see
Chapter 4).
 Photographer, illustrator, artist, or graphic designer: The job of this
person is to help you create and incorporate graphics and other visual
elements within your book (see Chapter 4).
 Editor: Your editor proofreads your manuscript and final page layouts
(see Chapter 5). Depending on your deal with the editor you hire, he or
she may only edit your book’s raw manuscript. You may also need to
hire a separate proofreader to review the final page layouts of your
book. Handle this negotiation when you hire an editor. See Chapter 13
for more info on proofreaders.
 Graphic designer: This professional assists with your book’s internal
page layout and design, as well as the front and back cover design (see
Chapters 8 and 9).
 Sales representative: A sales rep helps you obtain distribution of your
book through retail stores, catalogs, and distributors (see Chapter 15).
 Public relations, advertising, and marketing consultant: This person
creates, launches, and manages all aspects of publicity, advertising, and
marketing (see Chapters 18 and 19).
 Web site designer: Make a presence on the Internet and hire a person to
develop your Web site, so you can have a professional mass-marketed
presence for your book (see Chapter 21).
27
Chapter 2: Understanding the Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing

Determine your needs and budget before negotiating with any type of free-
lancer. Most freelance professionals expect to be paid on a per-project basis,
or they may bill by the hour. Make sure that you hire people with experience
doing whatever it is you need them to do. Also review resumes and portfolios
of work, as appropriate and ask for references from satisfied clients before
hiring your team.
With the help of this book, you can handle most, if not all, of the tasks associ-
ated with self-publishing yourself, which saves you money and allows you to
discover all aspects of the publishing business. Ultimately, you need to decide
how involved you want to get with the process, keeping in mind that none of
the major steps can be skipped if you want your book to be successful.
Do You Have the Skills that All 
Self-Published Authors Need?
An author who writes a book for a major publishing house is responsible
mainly for the completion of the book’s manuscript in a timely manner. As a
self-published author, you’re responsible for a lot more. The following sec-
tions help you determine if you have what it takes to become a successful
self-published author or if you should focus first on fine-tuning your core
skills.
Being willing to work hard
Writing the manuscript for your book can be a time-consuming project. After
the manuscript is complete, more of the business aspect of the work really
begins. Before embarking on a self-publishing project, ask yourself, “Am I
really willing to work hard and dedicate the time and energy needed to do
this project right?” Are you prepared to master new skills and focus your
energies, as their needed, on each aspect of the book publishing process?
Each person is totally different. There’s no way to predict what type of time
commitment is required when writing your book. Everyone writes at a differ-
ent speed and is willing to invest a different amount of time on each step of
the process. Every project is totally different. So don’t compare yourself to
other authors, and use your time wisely to finish your book to the best of
your ability.
28
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Catering to your audience with 
the right writing style
Chances are you’ve decided to write a book because you have knowledge,
experience, or an idea that you want to share with others. Like composing
music or creating a sculpture or painting, writing is an art form. As an expert
in your field, you need to be able to communicate your thoughts and ideas
using the written word.
No matter what type of book you’re writing, it’s vital that you thoroughly
understand the book’s intended audience (see Chapter 4 for more about tar-
geting certain readers). The vocabulary, sentence structure, and information
within your book should all cater specifically to your book’s target audience.
The words you use, your sentence structure, and your use of punctuation
and grammar make your book easy or difficult to understand.
For example, writing a children’s book that’s targeted to a 6-year-old and writ-
ing a how-to book written for college educated professionals differ greatly.
The vocabulary you use should be easy for the reader to understand, and
you never want to insult the reader’s intelligence either. Good author know
how to write specifically for the audience they’re trying to reach.
Hire a ghostwriter to help you complete your manuscript if you’re having
trouble writing (see “Hiring all the help you want and need” earlier in this
chapter). Or participate in a few writing classes to help craft your writing
skills. Writing classes and workshops are offered at many community col-
leges, through local adult education programs, and through professional writ-
ers’ and authors’ associations. Refer to recent issues of The Writer or Writer’s
Digest magazines (available at most newsstands) for ads on writer’s confer-
ences, classes, and workshops that are held throughout the country.
It’s your responsibility, as the writer, to create a manuscript that is well-
researched and written and that appeals to your intended audience. If you
hire an editor (see Chapter 5 about hiring an editor), it’s the editor’s job to
fine-tune your manuscript and correct any errors; it’s not his job to rewrite
your manuscript completely so it adheres to basic rules of English style and
punctuation. Never rely on your editor to take a poorly written manuscript
and transform it into what could become a bestseller.
Injecting creativity and personality 
into your work
Having a great idea for a book is one thing, but being able to write a manu-
script that’s fun, engaging to read, informative, and well-written is something
29
Chapter 2: Understanding the Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing

else altogether. If you’re writing a how-to book, for example, what sets your
book apart from the countless others that are published by the major pub-
lishing houses? What makes people want to read your book? After they
decide to read it, what about your book keeps their attention?
Make sure that you develop your own voice as a writer and discover how to
incorporate not just your knowledge and experience but your personality
into your book in order to make it more appealing to readers. For some writ-
ers, creativity comes naturally. They’ve been given a gift that makes them
good storytellers and excellent written communicators. Others need to work
on developing their creativity skills and incorporating imagination into their
writing. Check out the following ways to inspire your creativity:
 Take writing classes
 Attend adult education programs
 Enroll at the local community college
 Join a professional writer’s association
 Read magazines that cater to writers
 Participate in a writer’s workshop or special interest group
 Check the reference section of any bookstore for books on how to write
fiction, nonfiction, children’s books, poetry, or other types of literature
Becoming a good writer takes practice and is something that’s acquired over
time. Therefore, be prepared to write several drafts of your manuscript and
have it undergo significant editing before it’s ready for publication. If you’re
not sure you’ve managed to inject your own voice into your work, seek out
constructive criticism from professional editors or other people you trust.
A bestselling book (by traditional standards) must appeal to the masses, not
just a small niche audience, but if your book does target a narrowly defined
audience, the way you convey your information still needs to cater to your
readers and be easy to understand. If you’re writing a novel or work of fic-
tion, creativity is even more crucial. For example, your plot and characters
need to capture the reader’s imagination and take them on a journey. Keep in
mind that a niche-oriented book can also have extremely strong sales poten-
tial over the long term. Your book may not make it onto a bestseller list, but it
could sell a ton of copies and make you rich.
Honing your organizational skills
From the time you start working on your manuscript through the launch of
your published book, taking a well-organized and deadline-oriented approach
to each and every task associated with the publishing project helps keep you
on track and within your budget.
30
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

This process has many steps and involves countless details, none of which
can be allowed to fall through the cracks. If you get distracted easily or have
trouble dealing with time management issues, check out these tips to help
you get back on track:
 Keep detailed to-do lists of what you need to accomplish
 Set deadlines for yourself
 Stay focused on the big picture
 Micromanage the entire book publishing process
 Use an organization tool, such as a day planner or PDA
Don’t allow yourself to become overwhelmed. The divide and conquer strategy
works in almost every situation you encounter when it comes to handling the
major tasks involved with self-publishing your book. When trying to complete
a large task under a tight deadline, divide that task up into smaller, more man-
ageable tasks. For example, instead of focusing on writing an entire 100,000-
plus word manuscript, focus on completing each 5,000- to 8,000-word chapter.
By focusing on and completing one chapter at a time, before you know it, your
book is done. Chapter 1 has a brief self-publishing timeline that you can use to
help you see the big picture.
Being self-motivated
One of the perks and drawbacks to self-publishing your book is that you are
your own boss; therefore, no one breathes down your neck if you lose focus,
fall behind in writing your manuscript, or miss an important deadline. For
some people, getting overwhelmed when they’re faced with having to accom-
plish tasks that they’re not comfortable with is normal. If you’re one of these
people, determine in advance how you deal with difficult problems or situa-
tions. For example, if you have trouble sitting in front of your computer to
write your book’s manuscript because you keep getting distracted by the
phone ringing, the dog barking, or your baby crying, you need to take active
steps to eliminate those distractions. If you don’t have a clue about market-
ing and advertising, consider hiring someone as a freelance consultant with
this expertise to help you.
Stay motivated! As a writer and publisher, discover what motivates you, and do
what’s necessary to ensure that throughout the entire self-publishing process
you accomplish each task in a professional and timely way. Your overall objec-
tive is to produce the best book for your readers. Ponder these motivations:
 Why are you writing the book and what do you hope to accomplish 
with it?
 Are you writing the book to establish yourself as an expert in your field
and generate higher revenues as a paid consultant?
31
Chapter 2: Understanding the Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing

 Are you looking to communicate specific knowledge you possess to a
group of interested readers?
 What do you hope to gain from the experience and investment of your
time, effort, and money?
Don’t be afraid to reward yourself for achieving specific daily, weekly, or
monthly goals, and make a point to keep reviewing your progress to ensure
that you’re staying on track throughout the entire publishing process.
Rewards can include time out of your schedule such as a night out with
friends, a one-hour break to watch TV, or a run to Starbucks.
Can Self-Publishing Be a Full-Time Gig?
Being a professional, full-time, published writer can be a fun and rewarding
occupation, but it’s definitely not for everyone. Just because you’ve written
one book-length manuscript doesn’t mean that you have what it takes to quit
your day job and become a full-time professional writer and self-publisher.
Becoming a full-time writer means spending countless hours each day sitting
in front of a computer typing, researching, and having minimal interaction
with others. After all, for most people, writing isn’t a team activity. If you’re
not writing, you’re not being productive. If you’re not being productive,
you’re not earning a living.
A full-time writer must possess the following abilities in order to earn a living:
 Disciplined hard worker
 Deadline-oriented
 Focus and organization
 Extreme creativity
 Cater to your audience
 Ability to sell your work to editors
 Financial means to market and promote yourself and your books
If you find writing to be enjoyable and rewarding, consider writing additional
books as well as contributing articles to newspapers and magazines. You can
do this on a freelance basis and still hold down a full-time job (in order to
earn a living). And depending on how well your book sells, you might find
that by supplementing book sales with paid author appearances, lecturing,
and freelance article writing, that you can earn a full-time living.

Just as there are many bestselling authors out there, there are many, many
more writers and authors who don’t achieve success for a wide variety of rea-
sons. If you don’t have the skills that I discuss in the previous section, you
may not be ready to become a full-time self-published author. Here are a few
reasons why many authors fail to achieve success:
 Lack of knowledge about the topic they’re writing about: If you don’t
have the knowledge and experience you need to be an expert on any
given topic, doing the necessary research is critical before you actually
begin writing. Check out Chapter 4 for more about research.
 The inability to cope with writer’s block: At one time or another, all
writers are faced with staring at a blank computer screen or sheet of
paper and not being able to decide what to write or how to best put
their ideas into words. That lack of ideas is called writer’s block. The eas-
iest thing to do is walk away and give up, but the best thing to do to
battle writer’s block is to ensure that you’re chock-full of ideas about
what you want to write about ahead of time and that you’ve done plenty
of research and you’re investing the time to fully develop your idea
before sitting down to write.
 The failure to hire out specialized tasks, particularly book design, to
qualified professionals: Too many self-published books look obviously
amateurish because the author/publishers have decided that they can
handle design themselves, even when they have no experience. The
result is an unattractive cover and nearly unreadable type. The failure to
hire editors as needed can make books difficult to read and eliminate the
book’s word-of-mouth potential with satisfied readers.
 Poor marketing and promotional skills: The ability to self-promote is
one of the most important skills a writer should possess, especially if
you plan to self-publish your work. If you don’t properly promote your
work, people may not know it exists, and they may never read it. Part V
is full of helpful information on promoting your writing.
If you’re interested in pursuing writing (and self-publishing) as a career, con-
sider starting out part time, perhaps as a hobby. Write your first book or get a
handful of newspaper and/or magazine articles published. Determine what
area of writing you want to specialize in and begin fine-tuning your writing
skills. Build up your experience, but don’t give up your day job until you’ve
established yourself as a writer with enough earning potential to support
yourself.

B
usiness executives work from offices (and golf courses); artists and
musicians work in studios; and scientists work in laboratories. Each of
these professions, along with countless others, requires that the person work
within a special environment that’s equipped with the tools they need to suc-
cessfully complete their professional responsibilities. Because writing is both
an art form and a job, most writers prefer to do their work in a specialized
environment, which allows them to tap their true creativity, focus exclusively
on their writing, and avoid common distractions.
This chapter focuses on how to create the ideal writing environment for your-
self and how to gather the right combination of tools, equipment, and
resources to ensure that your writing efforts are as productive and successful
as possible.
Some of the tools in this chapter are also helpful in setting up and running
your own self-publishing business. For details on additional self-publishing
business supplies, see Chapter 6.
Fix It Up: Creating Your Ideal 
Writing Environment
Writing takes an incredible amount of focus, concentration, creativity, and, at
times, research. Whether you’re writing an essay, newspaper or magazine
article, poem, short story, or the manuscript for a full-length book, as a
writer, you need to focus not just on what you’re trying to say but also on
how you want to say it. Writing doesn’t have a formula or easy, predefined
steps you can follow to ensure that your finished product is a masterpiece.

As a writer, you need to follow established rules for grammar, punctuation,
and spelling. Plus, if you want your writing to be understood, you need to use
words that can be found in the dictionary. However, writing also involves cre-
ativity, organization, structure, and the ability to communicate with your
readers by using only the written word (as opposed to spoken language, com-
bined with body language and verbal intonations). Every word and sentence
that you write need to convey meaning and emotion, and help the readers
form a visual in their mind’s eye.
To successfully write a well-written book and to be able to focus your talents
on writing as an art form, most writers and authors find it extremely helpful
to create a work environment for themselves that allows them to maximize
their concentration, creativity, and writing skills. With the help of the follow-
ing sections, you can create a writing environment virtually anywhere, as
long as it’s someplace where you’re comfortable, able to think clearly, and
relatively free from distractions.
Deciding where to work
The first step to creating the ideal work environment is to decide where you
want to work: home, office, library, the park, an airplane, a train, or hotel
room. As you choose your location, consider your needs. Ask yourself the 
following questions:
 Do I have ample space to work without feeling confined or 
claustrophobic?
 Is the lighting and climate appropriate where I want to work? Can I open
windows, turn on lights, and adjust the temperature as needed?
 Is the environment clean and well organized?
 What distractions may I encounter? Does the phone constantly ring? Do
my children scream in the background? Do people constantly drop by
unannounced?
 What uncontrollable noise might I deal with? Does that noise bother me?
 What resources and equipment do I need at my disposal? Do I have the
tools needed to conduct research such as access to the Internet? Is
everything I need available and within reach? (See “Throw Away the
Hammer: Assembling the Writer’s Toolbox” later in this chapter for more
about necessary tools.)
The writing space where you work needs to be a place that’s comfortable for
you and allows you to focus on writing (without distractions). This space
may be a separate room or office in your home, an area of a room where you
can spread out your writing tools and work effectively or even at a Starbucks
or local coffee shop. Ideally, you don’t want to feel confined or be distracted
36
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

by outside stimuli when you’re focused on writing. Every person has unique
requirements for what constitutes an ideal writing environment. Do your best
to define what works for you and then create that environment for yourself.
If you’ve created the ideal work space, you know it because you’re able to be
productive, work comfortably, and be free of distractions as you’re working.
The proof is in the pudding. If you’re able to write and be proud of the work
you’re creating in the time you’ve dedicated to working, you’re in good
shape. If your work suffers or you’re unproductive, consider modifying your
workspace and environment.
Controlling your environment for maximum
comfort and productivity
After you’ve established where you want to write the most, take control of
your environment and make it fit your personal taste and needs by making
the space most conducive to your personal work habits.
As you create your work environment, figure out exactly what work-related
tasks you’re going to do and make sure that you have the tools, resources,
and equipment you need at your disposal. For example, if you’re conducting
phone interviews and doing research, having a telephone and recording
equipment, along with access to the Internet and your reference books and
paper-based files is critical. If you’re setting up your computer system and
related peripherals, such as a printer, you need ample electrical outlets and
desk space for this equipment and someplace to store your supplies. (See
“Throw Away the Hammer: Assembling the Writer’s Toolbox” later in this
chapter for more about writing tools.)
The perfect work environment should allow you to feel comfortable, relaxed,
and focused on the task at hand. The furniture, décor, lighting, temperature,
and ambiance should all be to your liking. Because you’re going to be spend-
ing many hours at a time working in this environment, pay attention to
ergonomics, especially in terms of your desk, chair, and computer keyboard.
The environment should also be clean, clutter free, and well organized to
help boost your creativity and productivity.
Sitting incorrectly for long periods of time, or having your hands at a bad
angle when you’re typing can cause back, neck, arm, and wrist pain, which
can lead to other injuries. Not having proper lighting may strain your eyes
and cause fatigue or headaches. If you’re too warm or too cold in your work-
space or uncomfortable where you’re sitting, these factors can decrease your
productivity, too.
37
Chapter 3: Equipping Yourself with the Write Stuff

Many office supply superstores (such as OfficeMax, Office Depot, or Staples)
along with mail order catalogs, such as Levenger (www.levenger.com) and
Relax The Back (www.relaxtheback.com), offer furniture specifically for
designed home offices.
In addition to ensuring your physical comfort when working, focus on what
helps you concentrate and bring about your creativity. Do you work well with
music or TV playing in the background? Do you enjoy having a cup of coffee
or a cold drink on your desk that you can sip throughout the day? Does using
a particular aromatic candle or incense help you relax and focus? Every
aspect of your environment can impact your comfort and creativity.
Even the smallest things can impact how productive and comfortable you are
in your work environment. For instance, many writers use their computer to
write. If this is the case for you, is your monitor large enough? Is there a glare
from a nearby window that’s distracting? Do you like your keyboard or is the
clicking noise it makes too loud? If you’re using a laptop, is the slightly
smaller keyboard too small for you to use for extended periods?
Minimizing distractions 
and drains on your time
When you’re trying to concentrate and be productive, there’s nothing worse
than being distracted. Multitasking is hard enough as a writer with trying to
maintain focus, meet deadlines, be creative, and be productive at the same
time. Constant distractions can greatly hinder your ability to work.
Pinpoint what distractions you’re most apt to encounter while you’re trying
to work. Determine, in advance, how you control or minimize them. Also,
consider how you’re spending your time. Answering the telephone, respond-
ing to e-mails, interacting with people via instant messaging (IM), or taking
too many breaks can all waste your time and keep you from your writing. 
The most common distractions are covered in the following sections.
An uncomfortable work environment
Make sure that you set yourself up with a comfortable desk and chair, ample
lighting, and proper room temperature (or adjustable temperature). See the
previous section for details on setting up a workspace that enhances produc-
tivity. Don’t forget — even what you’re wearing can affect your mood. Be
comfy!
An impractical workspace layout
When you’re working, you want to have a space that’s organized and helps
the flow of work and doesn’t take up extra time to get things done. Here are
some poor examples:
38
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

 If your printer is located across the room and you have to stand up and
walk ten feet to pick up your printouts, that’s poor planning.
 If you need to move around a lot to answer the phone or access your
most important papers, you need to rearrange your workspace so it’s
better organized.
 Don’t clutter your desk or work area with tools or items you don’t use
often.
Figure out what tools and equipment you need close by and then choose a
desk and related furniture that allows you to have what you need where you
need it. Office supply superstores and furniture stores offer a wide range of
home office desks and furniture that allow you to maximize available space.
Unavailable resources
Before you sit down to start writing, make sure that you have everything you
need within arm’s reach. If you need specific research materials that aren’t at
your fingertips, you may have to stop what you’re doing, find the necessary
materials, and then go back to work. This interruption may even include a
trip to the local library or searching through your files for something. I cover
research materials in more detail later in this chapter.
An obsession with checking your e-mail or surfing the Internet
Everyday, people receive e-mails (many of which are spam or unsolicited junk).
Reading and responding takes time. Plus, surfing the Internet can be a huge
time waster. Being a writer takes discipline. Unless you’re doing research that
pertains directly to your work, perhaps you should disconnect your computer
from the Internet while you’re writing.
Aside from Web surfing, one of the worst distractions involving the Internet is
IM. You don’t want to get caught up in meaningless conversations with your
Internet buddies while you’re trying to write. For the most part, people use
IM conversations to talk about gossip, pass along jokes, discuss the weather,
or engage in unimportant chit-chat. To avoid being constantly distracted, dis-
connect from your favorite IM services when you’re trying to concentrate on
your writing. You can also put up an away message, so people know that
you’re working, if you must have the IM on.
Loud noises
Uncontrollable noise can be caused by a number of things: nearby traffic, air-
planes flying overhead, construction, or obnoxious neighbors, children, and
dogs. Try to find a work environment that’s free from these distractions or
find a way to deal with them. Here a few suggestions:
 If you have children or household pets, make sure that your space
includes a door that you can shut and lock if necessary (make sure
someone else is watching your kid, though!)
39
Chapter 3: Equipping Yourself with the Write Stuff

 Consider using noise reduction headsets while you’re working. You can
find these headsets at consumer electronics stores such as Best Buy or
Circuit City.
 Playing music or the TV to drown out other noises can be an option for
some people; however, this practice can be more distracting if you’re not
careful. If you’re singing along with a song on the radio or trying to follow
the plot of a TV show, chances are you’re not focused on your work.
Constant incoming telephone calls
Telemarketers, friends, coworkers, relatives, and other people may call you
throughout the day. These calls can be extremely inconvenient when you’re
trying to concentrate on your work. The easiest fix for this problem is to set
up your answering machine or voice mail to answer calls automatically, so
you don’t even hear the ring. Then, take a break to check your messages
every few hours, and set aside a time of day to call people back.
Unannounced visitors
If you’re working in an office or even at home while others are present, set
ground rules for when you’re working. For example, block out several hours
per day when you don’t allow any intrusions whatsoever, unless it’s an emer-
gency. Consider placing a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, so people know not
to bother you.
Worries about deadlines and other time-management considerations
Because writing is an art form, the process can’t be rushed. The more you
write, the more comfortable you become with your work habits. Your habits
hopefully lead to meeting deadlines and making appointments and allow you
to best maximize your use of time.
One way to avoid worrying about meeting a deadline is to ensure that when
you start writing, you’ve already done all your research, so you know exactly
what you plan to write. It’s also extremely helpful for most writers to create a
detailed outline for themselves, before they actually start writing. (See
Chapter 4 for more information on outlines.) This preparedness gives you
more confidence in your abilities with each writing session.
Proper time management also plays an important role in your ability to meet
deadlines. Be realistic. Don’t expect to write a 30-page chapter for a book in
two or three hours. Allocate the necessary time in your schedule to accom-
plish your daily or weekly writing goals.
If you’re thinking about everything else you need to accomplish, including
other personal and professional responsibilities, you may never be able to
focus on the task at hand — writing. The best way to deal with this situation
is to block out a specific amount of time every day to write, knowing that you
have the rest of the day to deal with your other obligations. For some people,
40
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

this procedure may mean establishing a detailed work schedule. Some people
block out entire weekends to do their writing and free themselves up during
the week to manage their other responsibilities. Other writers prefer to work
late at night to avoid common distractions. If you do this, make sure that you
wind up getting enough sleep.
As you plan your writing schedule, take breaks throughout the day. Breaks
can include the following:
 5 to 15 minute breaks: Reward yourself for reaching specific objectives
or deadlines by taking 5 to 15 minute breaks.
 Eating: You also need to set aside time to eat a healthy meal and not just
a granola bar and a soda as you work.
 Stretching: Your muscles get tense, especially if you’ve been sitting in
front of your computer for several hours straight. Make sure that you
take a break to stretch your muscles. Consider taking a walk around the
block (and bring your dog, if you have one).
Throw Away the Hammer: Assembling
the Writer’s Toolbox
Every job enlists certain tools of the trade to complete the project. Writing is
no different. Just as carpenters rely on hammers, doctors on scalpels, and
painters on brushes, good writers need their own set of tools to help them
maximize their productivity, organization, and creativity. The following sec-
tions help you gather what you need in your writer’s toolbox.
The office equipment you need
Creating the right environment to do your writing is important. Equipping
your workspace with the right tools is equally crucial for achieving success.
In terms of office equipment and related technology, the following sections
summarize what you need to get the job done right.
A desktop or laptop computer with appropriate software
Your computer can be your primary tool for writing, page layout and design,
and cover design, as well as generating advertising, publicity, and marketing
materials for your book. Depending on your work habits, using a desktop 
or laptop computer with a PC or Macintosh base is a personal decision.
What’s important is that you determine, in advance, how the computer is
going to be used and then make sure that you invest in equipment capable 
of running all the software and peripherals you need. Here are some com-
puter considerations:
41
Chapter 3: Equipping Yourself with the Write Stuff

 Almost any new PC or Mac-based computer on the market today can
easily run word processing software, like Microsoft Word, plus be used
to surf the Internet (see the next section). Microsoft Word, which is part
of the Microsoft Office suite of applications, is the most commonly used
word-processing software in the world. If you use other word-processing
software, make sure that the files you create are Word compatible, so
any editor or printer can access your files.
 If you use Print-On-Demand (POD) technology to publish your book, the
company handles the necessary page layout and design for you. If, how-
ever, you’re using a traditional printer to publish your book, you need to
handle your own page layout and design. For this process, check out
specialized software such as Adobe InDesign CS2.
See Chapter 8 for more about page layout software, Chapter 10 for details on
traditional printers, and Chapter 11 for the scoop on POD technology.
An investment of under $1,000 (slightly more for a laptop computer) can buy
you a well-equipped computer system. If you plan on running more complex
page layout software, a computer with a larger capacity hard drive, faster
processor, and more internal memory may be needed.
Computers are complex machines that occasionally break down. Therefore,
always maintain a current backup on disk or flash drive of your important
data, including your manuscript files. It’s also worthwhile to invest in the
extended service plan offered by most computer manufacturers and com-
puter retailers. If you accidentally spill coffee on your keyboard, you have to
pay for the repair unless you purchased the extended service agreement.
Before purchasing any computer, determine the manufacturer’s repair poli-
cies and procedures for warranty and non-warranty issues. Some of the larger
and more well-known computer manufacturers offer the worst customer ser-
vice, technical support, and repair services in the industry. If you’re relying
on your computer and need it repaired quickly, make sure that the manufac-
turer will be there to help you. An alternative is to find a local computer
repair shop with qualified technicians.
Internet access
As an author, in addition to sending and receiving e-mail, you may rely on 
the Internet to conduct a lot of your research, and if you’re using a freelance
editor or a printer who’s not in your geographic area, you need to send and
receive large manuscript files electronically.
Equipping your computer with Internet access has never been easier or
cheaper. Obtaining a high-speed Internet connection, via DSL or Broadband
cable, is a good investment. The cost of a high-speed Internet connection
costs between $19.95 and $49.95 per month, depending on the provider and
type of connection.
42
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Instead of investing in a traditional fax machine, a computer that’s connected
to the Internet can also be used to send and receive faxes. A service, like
eFax.com (www.efax.com), makes easy work of sending and receiving faxes
electronically from anywhere. For about $13 per month, eFax provides you
with a unique fax phone number in your local area code. All of your incoming
faxes arrive as e-mail messages in whatever e-mail account you specify. You
can then view and print your faxes as PDF files, using your computer. If you
have a laptop computer, you can send and receive faxes from anywhere that
has an Internet connection.
A printer with handy features
For a writer producing a full-length manuscript, a good investment is a laser
printer capable of printing at least 8 to 15 pages per minute. Having this capa-
bility is important because when you need to print chapters of your book or
the entire manuscript to edit and review, printing doesn’t take too long. A
good laser printer costs between $300 and $500.
For some other handy features, you may want to invest in a wide-format color
or laser printer that can handle 11-x-17-inch sheets of paper so you can easily
view double-page spreads and view each page in its actual size (if you’re cre-
ating and reviewing final page layout at home).
If you want to save space in a home office environment, consider investing in
a laser printer that’s also a scanner, fax machine, and photocopier. This com-
bination printer is an excellent idea for a writer because it gives you a variety
of tools right at your fingertips, especially if you’re dealing with research
materials that need to be organized, copied, received via fax, or scanned into
a database for your document.
43
Chapter 3: Equipping Yourself with the Write Stuff
If your computer bites
Are you still a bit wary of computers? Other
options for creating a manuscript include writing
longhand (using a traditional pen and paper),
using an old-fashioned typewriter (if you can find
one that still works), or dictating your manuscript
into a cassette recorder and later having it tran-
scribed. But keep in mind that because most self-
publishing relies on the creation of an electronic
document (created using a word processor or
page layout and design software) that ultimately
goes to a printer, write out your manuscript in
longhand or using a typewriter isn’t too practical,
but it can be done. You may be adding extra steps
to the publishing process in order to prepare the
manuscript appropriately. These steps also add
to your costs.

Telephone service
Whether you’re conducting interviews, working with your editor over the
phone, or discussing your book printing needs with a handful of publishers,
you need access to a telephone.
If you want to establish your own publishing business (see Chapter 6 for
details), invest in a company telephone line so your personal and business
calls can be kept totally separate. Keep these tips in mind:
 Your telephone should be able to handle at least two phone lines and
have a hold feature.
 Make sure that your phone service has the features you need, such as
voice mail, call waiting, three-way calling, caller ID, call answering, and
call forwarding.
 To facilitate order-taking, you may also want to arrange to have a toll-
free phone number added to your existing phone service. See Chapter
16 for details on how to do this.
Chances are that you already have traditional home telephone service, but
here are two other service options to consider:
 Voice-Over-IP: This service uses your high-speed Internet connection to
give you local and long distance calling capabilities along with virtually
all the calling features and services offered by traditional phone compa-
nies. Many Voice-Over-IP services are priced at a flat monthly fee, which
varies depending on the provider. Check out Vonage at
www.vonage.com as one service that you can use.
 Cellular phones: A cell phone has become an indispensable business
tool; it’s important to be able to reach people when you need them and
to be readily accessible to the people and companies you work with. If
you don’t yet have a cell phone, service and equipment is available from
a wide range of providers:
• Sprint/NEXTEL: Phone (800) 480-4727; Web site www.sprint.com
• Cingular: Phone (800) 331-0500; Web site www.cingular.com
• T-Mobile: Phone (866) 464-8662; Web site www.tmobile.com
• Verizon Wireless: Phone (800) 922-0204; Web site www.verizon
wireless.com
When shopping for cell phone service, determine your needs and poten-
tial usage, then find the best deal available with the shortest contract
commitment possible. Look for a plan with a high number of anytime
minutes, unlimited nights and weekends, and no roaming or long dis-
tance charges.
44
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Tools to enhance your creativity
A variety of tools exist that many writers can use to keep track of ideas,
brainstorm, and stay organized. The tools in the following sections can be
useful to writers.
Notebooks and pens
Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night with a great idea and not
written it down and then forgotten it the next morning? You want to kick
yourself, don’t you? You never know when a brilliant idea may pop into your
head, so have a small notebook with a reliable pen handy for whenever cre-
ativity strikes. Tuck away small notebooks near your bed and in your brief-
case, desk, pocket, purse, or car (but don’t write while driving).
Many journalists and reporters use 4-x-81⁄2-inch reporter’s notebooks, which
can be ordered in quantity online or from your favorite office supply super-
store. A more upscale version of the traditional reporter’s notebook is 
manufactured by Moleskineus (www.moleskineus.com/moleskine-
reporter-notebook.html). Their version, the 31⁄2-x-51⁄2-inch, 129-
page-bound notebook, has a hardcover design and can last for years.
A tape or digital recorder
Some writers first prefer to dictate their ideas into a tape recorder before
they start writing. Other writers record all their in-person and phone inter-
views to ensure accuracy. (A separate device for connecting any recorder to
a telephone line in order to record interviews and conversations has to be
purchased). Having a tape recorder in your car allows you to record ideas
while you’re driving instead of trying to write down your thoughts while
you’re sailing down the busy freeway!
When you’re shopping for a recorder, you may want to look into microcas-
sette recorders because they’re portable, which offers added convenience.
(Traditional cassette tape recorders can be a bit bulky and awkward, espe-
cially when you try to fit it in your pocket!)
In recent years, digital voice recorders have hit the market, allowing for
hours of voice recordings to be made without a cassette tape. The digital
audio files can then be quickly transferred to a computer (via a USB cable)
for storage, playback, or editing. Start researching prices for your purchase,
but I recommend Olympus. This company offers a full line of professional dic-
tating equipment, digital voice recorders, and microcassette recorders, which
fit in the palm of your hand. These units can be purchased at popular con-
sumer electronics and office supply superstores, starting at under $50. Or
visit www.olympusamerica.com.
45
Chapter 3: Equipping Yourself with the Write Stuff

A camera
Depending on the type of writing you do and whether you incorporate pho-
tographs in your self-published book (see Chapter 4 for more about using
photos), you may consider investing in a high-end digital camera or tradi-
tional 35mm camera.
The benefits of a digital camera, over a traditional 35mm camera include
 Editing the pictures on your computer before incorporating them into
your book
 Being able to quickly take pictures and then comparing many potential
images before choosing the perfect one
 Saving time and money on film developing costs
Digital cameras range in price from around $100 to several thousand dollars.
If you want to use photographs in your book, invest in a digital camera that
offers at least 5,000,000 to 8,000,000 mega-pixel resolution. The quality of the
pictures you take using a digital camera is determined by the resolution (the
number of pixels or tiny dots that make up the image) the picture is taken in.
A camera that can take photographs using 8,000,000 mega-pixel resolution
means that 8,000,000 colored pixels are used to create it. The more pixels, the
more detailed the image.
Many writers take photographs for their own purposes to help jog their
memory of people they interview, places they’ve been, or events they’ve
experienced. These photos may never actually get published, but they pro-
vide writers with additional documentation they can use when writing.
Research materials
Depending on the topic you’re writing about, most authors rely on their
research materials. These materials may include
 Audio tapes
 Books
 Company press kits
 Computer print outs
 Internet files
 Journals
 Magazines
 Newsletters
 Photographs
 Video tapes
46
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

No matter what type of research materials you rely on, when you’re writing, 
it’s important to have these materials within reach and to keep them organized
in desktop files or filing cabinets so you can find the information you need
quickly. See Chapter 4 for the full scoop on researching.
A dictionary, a thesaurus, and other writing reference books
As a writer or author, you rely on words to communicate. Having a dictionary
and thesaurus on-hand when you’re writing is a valuable tool, especially if
you get into the habit of using them. In addition to helping you better com-
municate with your readers, a dictionary and thesaurus can help you build
your vocabulary.
These references are readily available in a variety of traditional book formats,
but if you rely on the Internet for many things (as several people do), access
electronic formats on the Internet through www.dictionary.com or www.
thesaurus.com. Or add an optional software application to your personal
digital assistants (PDA) if you have one (see the next section).
Two additional and very useful reference books for writers are The Associated
Press Stylebook and The Associated Press Guide to Punctuation. Both are pub-
lished by Basic Books and available through bookstores. These reference
guides quickly answer common questions about writing style, formatting,
punctuation, and the use of common words or terms.
A personal planner or a personal digital assistant
A personal planner or a personal digital assistant (PDA) can be the ultimate
time management and organizational tool that every author should own to
help meet deadlines, plan schedules, keep track of to-do lists, and organize
information (including a personal address book).
A personal planner is a printed notebook that comes in a wide range of sizes
and formats. A personal planner can be purchased from an office supply
store for between $10 and $100. A PDA is a palm-sized computer that’s
equipped with specialized software. PDAs are priced between $100 and $600.
Either of these tools can also be used to jot down notes and other pieces of
information wherever you happen to be. Find a PDA or personal planner that
you’re comfortable carrying with you when you’re on the go or keeping on
your desk when you’re working from home or the office.

Creating a Winning Manuscript
In This Chapter
 Considering your audience’s needs and wants
 Preparing an outline and researching your book’s content
 Incorporating visual elements into your text
 Adding sections to your manuscript’s beginning and end
 Securing the right releases and steering clear of plagiarism
W
hen you first sit down at your computer, stare at a blank screen, and
know you need to come up with hundreds of pages worth of interest-
ing, informative, entertaining, and well-written text, it’s enough to give
anyone second thoughts about becoming an author. Well, don’t panic! If you
take an organized and disciplined approach to your writing, you discover
that putting together a book-length manuscript is a manageable task.
As you develop your manuscript, which ultimately becomes your published
book, you have a variety of things to consider. Assuming you already know
your topic, this chapter provides you with strategies for considering the
needs of your audience and creating the most well-organized, informative,
and entertaining manuscript possible. I also explain how to effectively
research your topic, incorporate visual elements and special sections into
your manuscript, obtain permissions, and avoid plagiarism.
It’s Not Always About You! Considering
Your Audience Upfront
You may have already determined the audience to which you’re writing
toward. These people are your readers. Most books, whether they’re fiction
or nonfiction, cater to a specific audience or demographic. After you specify
your target readers, you also need to make sure that the content you’re
giving them is appropriate for their wants and needs. In the following sec-
tions, I show you how to identify your book’s target audience and choose the
right content for them.

Targeting certain readers
No matter what type of book you’re planning to write the first thing you need
to do, before you start writing your manuscript, is determine exactly who
your book targets. Who is most apt to purchase and read your book and
why? What information does the reader want or expect to obtain by reading
your book?
The target audience for your book may be somewhat broad. Or, your book
may be targeted to a niche audience, comprising people with a very specific
interest. Whatever the case, as the author, not only do you have to understand
exactly who you’re writing your book for, but also you must understand what
the reader hopes to get out of your book. You need to ensure that you pro-
vide that information to your readers in the most enjoyable way possible.
After you pinpoint your target audience, get to know your potential reader.
Ask yourself the following questions:
 Is my book’s average reader a male or female?
 What age range do my readers fall into?
 How educated is my average reader?
Also consider why the reader may be interested in your book.
 What new information do I offer?
 How do I convey this new information?
 How much does the reader already know about the topic I’m writing
about?
 Is my topic too simplistic or complex for the intended reader?
 If I’m writing fiction, what elements of the storyline do readers best
relate to?
 Am I developing my characters so they appeal to my target audience?
 Does the audience understand, relate to, and appreciate the storyline,
characters, and subplot(s) based on their knowledge, education, and
background?
Doing research to understand exactly who your audience is helps you create
a book that’s of interest to readers. The book provides value to the readers,
educates them, and/or entertains them in an appropriate manner based on
age, education, interests, and intelligence.
50
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Choosing appropriate content
To ensure that your book targets the appropriate audience, provides informa-
tion of interest, and stays on target in terms of the content, ask yourself these
questions:
 Specifically, what am I trying to teach the reader?
 Am I writing something that my target audience may be interested in?
 Do my readers find the information useful and/or entertaining?
 Am I taking into account the information or knowledge the reader
already has and then building on it?
 How does my target audience use the information?
 Is the information informative, well written, and entertaining?
 Have I explained key concepts in a way my readers can understand?
 Do the examples, artwork, charts, or graphics I plan to incorporate into
the book help convey the information? (See “What Meets the Eye:
Adding Visual Interest to Your Manuscript,” later in this chapter for
details on graphic elements.)
 If I’m writing fiction, does my reader relate to the characters, plot, and
subplots?
 Does my story tap into the reader’s imagination and entertainment them?
After you become familiar with your audience, you’re in a much better posi-
tion to choose what content is most appropriate.
When it comes to choosing content for your book, consider what the reader
may already know, and then slowly build on that knowledge. As necessary,
provide the background information your readers need to understand fully
whatever it is you’re writing about, even if it’s a novel.
Writing a full-length book is a process. Most writers create multiple drafts of
their manuscript prior to getting it published. As you review each draft,
follow these tips:
 Rewrite sections as needed.
 Delete unnecessary information.
 Fine-tune your approach to cover information.
 Carefully analyze each chapter to ensure that the entire manuscript
flows smoothly and achieves its objectives.
51
Chapter 4: Creating a Winning Manuscript

Being an expert in your field and performing research to develop the content
of your book is important. You may have to write several drafts of your manu-
script before you’re confident that you’ve successfully found the best way to
communicate the information that’s in your head.
Don’t Be Sketchy: Creating an Outline
Writers can easily get lost in their manuscript of several hundred pages and
lose focus on their true objectives. A lack of focus can lead to disorganization
of information, repetition, deletion of key content, and ultimately production
of a manuscript that’s difficult to read, understand, and enjoy. The informa-
tion you’re writing about may be crystal clear in your head, but your goal as
an author is to ensure that whatever you’re writing is understandable in terms
of how it’s communicated on the printed page.
The easiest way to ensure that your manuscript is organized, flows nicely,
and makes sense to the reader is to create a detailed outline before you actu-
ally begin writing. Also, if you’ve already started writing your book but find
that you’re having a hard time staying focused and organized, coming up with
an outline may help you get back on track.
52
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 
Who you gonna call? Ghostwriters!
If you’re a recognized expert in your field but not
a writer, seriously consider hiring a professional
ghostwriter who works closely with you to
create your book’s manuscript based on infor-
mation you provide. Any literary agent can pro-
vide referrals for experienced and previously
published ghostwriters. When you see a book
written by a big-name celebrity, business exec-
utive, or athlete, more times than not, a profes-
sional writer was the ghostwriter on that book.
Check out or Elance (www.elance.com) or
the American Society of Journalists and
Authors (www.asja.org) for info on finding
a ghostwriter.
When working with a ghostwriter, remember
the following information:
 Work closely with the person; don’t just to
provide exact information and content you
want in your book.
 Ensure that the writer you hire communicates
the information in your voice and that the
ghostwriter understands the target audience.
 While a talented ghostwriter is able to write
on any topic, hire someone with some pre-
vious experience writing about topics
related to your book.
 Hiring a skilled and experienced ghost-
writer may not be cheap, but the results can
dramatically improve the overall quality of
your book and improve its chances for
achieving success.

An outline for a book-length manuscript can be anywhere from 1 to 20 pages
in length, depending on the level of detail you get into. This phase of the writ-
ing process is so important that most major publishing houses require even
their most experienced authors to submit a detailed outline for each book
before they begin writing.
In the following sections, I explain the importance of having an outline as you
write and show you how to format and flesh out your outline with solid info.
Understanding an outline’s importance
An outline provides a detailed overview of your book’s content in just a few
pages. The information gets divided up into sections and subsections, which
ultimately expands into the individual chapters or sections of your book.
Working from a detailed outline forces you to consider every topic you plan
to write about within your book. An outline should be created for any type of
book, whether it’s fiction or nonfiction:
 For a work of fiction, the outline helps ensure that the timeline of your
plot makes sense and that plot twists, subplots, or aspects of each char-
acter’s development happen at the appropriate time in the story.
 For nonfiction, an outline ensures that you first build a foundation of
knowledge for your readers and then with each subsequent chapter, 
you appropriately build on that knowledge one concept at a time in an
organized way without jumping ahead or repeating ideas from earlier
chapters.
Creating an outline organizes your thoughts, research, and content, but it
also helps with the following items:
 Assists you in deciding what information to include within your book
 Ensures that the information is placed in appropriate chapters and flows
smoothly from the beginning of the book to the end
 Helps you avoid repetition
 Ensures that you don’t forget to include key content
 Forces you to consider your book’s page count and how much space
you dedicate to each topic within each chapter or section
 Makes sure that you stay focused and take an organized approach to
writing your manuscript
Working from your detailed outline can help you tackle the daunting task of
writing, and it may even help eliminate that dreaded writer’s block.
53
Chapter 4: Creating a Winning Manuscript

Ordering your topics
Before you begin writing an outline, consider putting together a detailed list
of topics and subtopics to include in your book, and then follow these steps:
1. Write each idea, topic, or subtopic on a separate index card.
By keeping each idea or concept separate, you can reorganize them or
build on them with ease as you’re planning your book’s content.
2. Spread out your collection of index cards on a table and begin moving
them around.
With each idea on a separate card, you can pinpoint essential information
and cluster cards that contain supporting ideas, concepts, or information.
3. Place each card in an order that makes sense in your book.
As you do this, notice that the content for each chapter or section
within your book begins to take shape. Be willing to tinker with your 
outline extensively by adding and removing topics and then moving 
content around, until you’ve developed a true template for your book.
4. Arrange your chapters into a logical order.
This step ensures that your book is easy to understand. The chapters
should nicely flow from one topic to the next and build on the knowl-
edge the reader has already gained.
Creating an outline is easy if you’re writing a how-to book, for example, but
you can also create an outline for a novel. Consider how the story progresses
from one chapter to the next. Describe plots, subplots, plot twists, characters
to be introduced, timelines, settings, and so on.
After your index cards are properly grouped together, create a detailed writ-
ten outline for your book (see the next section).
Formatting and polishing your outline
The level of detail you include in your outline depends on your knowledge of
and comfort with the topic. The more detailed your outline, however, the
easier it is to keep your manuscript well organized and ensure that you don’t
accidentally leave out important details, concepts, ideas, or content. In the
following sections, I show you how to format and polish your outline.
54
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Looking at different formats
Outlines typically are divided into A, B, C, D, and even E headings. An A heading
might be a chapter title. Under each chapter title is a handful of topics included
within that chapter (referred to as B headings). Under each B heading are key
pieces of information or content that relates directly to that subheading or
section. These can be C, D, and E headings, as appropriate.
Depending on the topic of your book and your personal work habits, choose
an outline format that helps you best organize your manuscript and that sup-
ports your style of writing:
 Using a traditional outline helps you create a detailed template for your
book and divides information based on chapters with headings, sub-
headings, and sidebars.
 Using a bulleted outline can help you better organize general ideas and
decide where they go within your manuscript.
Figure 4-1 is a traditional outline format. Notice that it uses Roman numerals,
letters, and numbers.
Instead of using Roman numerals to list heads and subheads within an out-
line, some writers prefer to use bullets, as shown in Figure 4-2.
An outline in either format can be created using a pen and paper or a word
processor (Microsoft Word has a built-in outlining feature). An outline also
can be written in sentence fragments as opposed to complete sentences; as
long as the content makes sense to you, the outline should be functional. The
goal is to organize your ideas as concisely as possible. The more topics and
subtopics you include, the more detailed your outline becomes.
If you’re writing fiction, you can also use a detailed outline to help you keep
track of your overall storyline, plot twists, subplots, and characters. When
writing a novel, keeping track of details about characters and storylines can
become challenging. Because continuity and a clear timeline are important,
an outline can help you keep the details straight.
Including the fine details
Writing a full-length manuscript is like taking a cross-country road trip. You
can get lost with one wrong turn and then need to backtrack. To avoid unnec-
essary delays as you’re writing, rely on your outline as your road map and
refer to it constantly.

Chapter 4: Creating a Winning Manuscript

Invest significant time developing your outline and fine-tuning it. Don’t be afraid
to move portions of your outline around and add or delete sections until
you’ve created a document that can be used as a foundation for writing the
actual manuscript. Here are some other tips to help you polish your outline:
 Consider adding actual chapter titles and section headings and subhead-
ings to help you create a more comprehensive overview.
 List specifically where elements of your manuscript go, such as side-
bars, interviews (quotes), photographs, examples, references, statistics,
illustrations, graphs, charts, and checklists.
 Think about how many pages of your book you want dedicated to each
chapter, topic, or section, keeping in mind the total number of pages
your manuscript needs to be when complete.
 Try to keep your manuscript well balanced. All your chapters should be
equal in length. This rule isn’t steadfast but helps with the book’s flow.
This concept applies to fiction as well, although with fiction, it’s more
important that your story flow smoothly and engage the reader.
 If you’re writing fiction, list what happens in each chapter, what plot
twists you introduce, and the relevant details about characters.
Find a handful of people who are also knowledgeable about what you write
and have them review your outline and provide feedback. Obtaining someone
else’s perspective may help you develop a more thorough outline. The more
work you do now in terms of organizing and choosing the content for your
book, the easier the actual manuscript writing process is.
As you’re writing your manuscript, place a checkmark on your outline next to
completed sections. During the actual writing phase, you may determine that
a change to your outline is appropriate. Unlike the Ten Commandments, your
outline isn’t etched in stone. You’re free to make changes as you go.
Dig for Facts: Doing Research
Even if you’re the world’s most renowned expert in your field, filling a book
with interesting, informative, and accurate information can be a huge chal-
lenge. Either prior to writing your book or as you’re writing, you may need to
conduct research and combine that information with your own knowledge
and experience in order to create the best possible book.
If you’re writing anything that’s technical in nature, you especially want to
convey accurate information. Even when writing fiction, research helps your
story be more believable. Bestselling authors, such as Tom Clancy, Dan Brown,
and John Grisham often credit a handful of experts in their book’s respective
58
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

acknowledgments. These authors rely on experts to provide some of the
technical details that allow their fictional stories to be more realistic.
The four primary methods for doing research include
 Surfing the Internet
 Visiting the library and reading books, magazines, newspapers, and
newsletters
 Buying books and magazines from a bookstore that relate to your topic
 Interviewing experts
Avoid embarrassing errors in your text. No matter what type of research you
do, make sure that the various sources you use are timely, reliable, and accu-
rate. Here are some tips:
 Research each source.
 Try to confirm the facts and figures with other sources.
 Make sure that your information isn’t outdated.
 Keep detailed notes about where information comes from.
 Include a bibliography section at the end of your book (I cover bibliogra-
phies later in this chapter), because you need to accurately cite all your
sources.
It’s useful to keep one master list of all your reference materials and resources.
For each source you use, gather the following information:
 Title of the article or chapter
 Title of the book, publication, or source
 Name of the author(s) or people interviewed
 Contact information for each person you’ve interviewed or used as a
source
 Copyright or publication date
 Specific page numbers, Web site URLs, or location of the information
 Written permission to use the information in your book, if applicable
(see “Keep It Legal: Obtaining Permission to Use Other People’s
Materials,” later in this chapter)
When using the Internet as a reference tool, print out the information you use
and keep a file of those printouts. Make sure that the Web site address and
date is printed on the various pages.
59
Chapter 4: Creating a Winning Manuscript

If you’re looking to include the most timely and cutting-edge information pos-
sible, your best bet is to track down a handful of recognized experts on the
topic you’re writing about and interview those people. When conducting an
interview for your book, make sure that you gather the following information:
 The interviewee’s name (including the correct spelling)
 How the interviewee wants to be credited within your book, including
their company’s name and exact job title (if applicable)
 The source of any statistics or research data, for example, the intervie-
wee provides during the interview
 A signed release stating that you have the interviewee’s permission to
include excerpts from the interview within your book
Whether you’re an accomplished journalist or a first-time author, record all
your interviews. Before doing this, however, make sure that it’s okay with the
interviewee. Having a recording to refer to while you’re writing helps ensure
proper quotes in your book and accurate context of the conversation.
What Meets the Eye: Adding Visual
Interest to Your Manuscript
As soon as you begin creating the outline for your manuscript, decide what
graphic elements to include for visual appeal. Graphics can also be acquired
and placed within the manuscript as you’re writing or during the final page
layout and design process. After the pages are laid out, however, adding or
deleting large amounts of text or graphics requires major layout and design
changes, which can be time consuming and costly.
Use specific elements in your book to help organize information for your
readers. Depending on your topic, approach, and applicability, consider using
the following elements in your book (these don’t apply in a novel, however):
 Sidebars: A sidebar is a subsection of a chapter that allows you to go off
on a tangent without interrupting the reader’s train of thought. Sidebars
are used in nonfiction books to provide examples, short anecdotes,
short interviews, or other information that doesn’t directly flow with
the main body of the manuscript. But the sidebar does relate to the
topic at hand and tends to be short — between a quarter of a page
and one full page.
60
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

 Lists: A list, like the one you’re reading right now, can be in bulleted form.
It’s an easy way to communicate information to the reader. Items in a list
can be short and concise and communicated in full sentences or sentence
fragments. Lists can be numbered if they must be followed in a specific
order, or you can use bullets to emphasize key pieces of information that
can be followed in any order.
 Checklists: A checklist, like a list, can be used as a tool to help readers
follow a list of steps without forgetting anything. Reader can check off
boxes as they complete steps to ensure that nothing is forgotten.
 Charts and graphs: If you’re trying to communicate a lot of numbers or
statistics, a chart or a graph provides a visual, easier way to showcase
the data. You can create a wide range of charts and graphics using a
spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, depending on your
needs. You can also hire a professional graphic artist to create visual 
elements for your book.
 Graphics: Graphics such as illustrations or drawings can be used to
communicate information or simply add visual appeal. As you consider
incorporating graphics, refrain from making your final laid out book pages
look too cluttered. Illustrations and drawings should be created by a
professional artist, unless you have strong artistic skills. The graphics
should look professional and help communicate important information.
 Graphic icons: Throughout this book you find graphic icons called
Remember, Tip, and Warning. Graphic icons can be used within your
book, if applicable, to draw the reader’s attention to something specific.
A graphic artist can help you design these visual elements for your book.
 Photographs: Often, the easiest way to convey information is through
the use of a photograph. Depending on the type of book you’re writing,
you can often include black and white images within the main body of
your book. Some self-publishing options allow for full-color photographs
to be used as well. You can take photographs yourself, purchase images
from a stock photo agency, or hire a professional photographer to create
customized photos for you (each option depends on your budget).
If you’re on a tight budget, consider using photographic images from
a stock photo library. To find a library of stock photography, use any
Internet search engine and enter the search phrase stock photo library.
The following list includes three examples of stock photo libraries:
• PhotoObjects.net (www.photoobjects.net)
• Photos.com (www.photos.com)
• ShutterStock (www.shutterstock.com)
61
Chapter 4: Creating a Winning Manuscript

If you want to incorporate photographs, charts, or graphics in your book and
refer to those elements within the main body of your text, use figure numbers
and captions to identify each graphic or image. Figure numbers typically
begin with the chapter number, followed by a dash or period and are in
chronological order. The first image in Chapter 3, for example, is labeled
Figure 3-1 or Figure 3.1. The second is Figure 3-2 or Figure 3.2 and so on.
Below each image, include a one-sentence (or shorter) caption, identifying
what the reader’s looking at.
Put the Pieces Together: Examining 
Other Book Elements
If you look at any book — fiction or nonfiction — it typically contains special
sections. Many of these sections are standard. Which elements you include
within your book depends on your personal preferences and the type of book
you’re writing. I cover all these elements, in order of their appearance in a
book, in the following sections.
Copyright page
The copyright page lists all the legal information pertaining to the publication
of the book, including details about its copyright, publisher, ISBN, Library of
Congress Control Number, and trademarks used in the book. The copyright
page usually appears on a left-handed page, directly after the inside title page.
Author acknowledgments
This section of your book thanks anyone and everyone who helped you write
and publish the book. It’s also where the author can thank loved ones, friends,
coworkers, and even her dog if she wants. This section can be a few sentences
or up to one page long, but one to two paragraphs is standard. Don’t forget to
thank the reader for buying your book (not required, but a nice touch!).
Table of contents
A table of contents is simply a list of the chapters and major sections within
your book and their respective page numbers in a directory-like listing. A table
of contents makes it easy for readers to find what they’re looking for and skip
directly to that section or chapter.
62
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Your table of contents can list just your chapters and related page numbers,
like the Contents at a Glance section at the front of this book does, or it can
include subtopics to provide a more comprehensive listing about what’s in
your book. Check out the table of contents in the beginning of this book.
Foreword and/or Preface
A foreword is typically written as an introduction to your book, but it’s 
written by someone other than the main author, such as a famous person,
another author, or a well-known expert. In terms of length, a foreword can be
one to five pages, and contains information about what’s included within the
book, and it describes some of the reasons why the book may be of interest
to the reader. When you have someone write your foreword, obtain written
permission from the foreword writer (see “Keep It Legal: Obtaining Permission
to Use Other People’s Materials,” later in this chapter).
A preface contains much of the same information as a foreword does, except
that it’s typically written by the book’s author. The preface sets the tone of
the book and tells the reader what to expect. A book, whether it’s fiction or
nonfiction, can have both a preface and a foreword; however, this practice
isn’t too common. If you have a foreword in your book, you can add any mes-
sages for your reader within the acknowledgements or introduction sections
without using the preface, too.
Introduction
An introduction introduces the content in your book. It can be written in
first person, so you, the author, can communicate directly with the reader.
Don’t confuse the introduction with the preface; the intro is typically longer
and more detailed than a preface. The length typically runs one page, but it
can be as long as the other chapters in your book if you want.
Here’s what to include in your intro for different types of books:
 Nonfiction: Your introduction precedes Chapter 1 and provides the
reader with a general overview of what the book is about, who’s reading
it, and what it contains. The intro can also include a summary of core
knowledge that readers need prior to reading your book.
 Fiction: The introduction can be used to set the stage and provide read-
ers with background stories, character information, or plot details they
need before the actual story begins.

Appendixes
Found at the end of a book, an appendix can be a list of resources or the
equivalent of a short chapter offering information that relates to your book’s
topic but that didn’t easily fit into the main body of the book. The appendixes
can also summarize important information and provide worksheets or addi-
tional checklists for the reader.
Appendixes are typically found in nonfiction books. If you plan to incorporate
appendixes into your book, plan on having at least three to five of them
(although this isn’t a steadfast rule). Keep each appendix short (no longer
than two or three pages). They’re typically titled Appendix A, Appendix B,
Appendix C, and so on, although each can also have a short title.
Bibliography
If you’ve relied on many sources of information for your book, include a detailed
listing of your sources at the end of the book in the form of a formatted bibli-
ography. Follow traditional formatting based on the type of source you’ve
quoted, excerpted, or paraphrased as a reference.
The Chicago Manual of Style (University of Chicago Press) offers guidelines
that are commonly used within the publishing industry for formatting bibli-
ographies. Visit www.chicagomanualofstyle.org for more information.
Glossary
Found at the end of some nonfiction books, a glossary is a list of terms and
their definitions. The length of a glossary varies, based on the number of
terms you wish to explain. This section is a good quick reference for readers,
so try to keep your definitions short.
A glossary is handy if your book contains a lot of technical terms the reader
needs to know to better understand and use the content in your book.
Italicize the words that appear in the glossary to indicate to the reader
that the term is defined elsewhere.
Index
An index is a detailed listing of keywords and topics featured within a nonfiction
book. Each keyword also has a specific page reference where more information
can be found in the book. An index is far more detailed than a table of contents
64
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

(covered earlier in this chapter). Putting together an index is time consuming,
but it can be a valuable resource for your readers to find specifics quickly
within your book.
Most companies that offer self-publishing services, including Print-On-Demand
(POD) publishers (see Chapter 11 for details on these companies), provide an
indexing service for an additional fee.
“About the Author”
Some fiction and nonfiction authors like to dedicate a page (either in the
beginning or end of the book) with detailed information about themselves
such as a picture, background, education, company or employer, credentials,
or other personal details. Within this section, you may choose to also pro-
mote your Web site or disclose a mailing or e-mail address so your readers
can contact you.
The “About the Author” section of your book provides more detail than
the short paragraph you include about yourself on your book’s back cover.
(See Chapter 9 for details about creating your book’s front and back covers.)
If you’re publishing a hardcover book, the “About the Author” section can be
placed on the book’s jacket.
Keep It Legal: Obtaining Permission 
to Use Other People’s Materials
Anytime you incorporate someone else’s words, writing, artwork, pho-
tographs, or original ideas into your writing not only do you need to give
proper credit where credit is due, but also you must obtain the necessary
permission, in writing, from the copyright owner of that material.
The written permission you obtain can be in the form of a standard release
(a legal document any lawyer can create for you) or a simple letter stating
that you have permission to use the material in your book. The letter you
obtain should be signed and dated by all parties involved and should spell
out exactly how and when the material is used.
Consult a lawyer who specializes in copyright laws for guidelines about
what specifically you need to do to protect yourself from legal problems
after your book is published. Generally, you want to obtain permission
for anything that is copyrighted, trademarked, or patented that you plan to
use in your book.
65
Chapter 4: Creating a Winning Manuscript

Interviews
Information from interviews can add valuable text to your book. Include the
name of the person you interviewed and likeness (if applicable) within your
book. Check out “Dig for Facts: Doing Research,” earlier in this chapter for
more details on interviews.
Foreword
If you’ve asked someone else to write the foreword for your book, make sure
to obtain written permission from the writer to use the name and words
within your book. Simply draw up a basic release or a letter stating that you
have permission to use their words and name in your book, and then have
the foreword writer sign the agreement.
Photographs
Depending on the situation, using photographs within a book can be a bit
tricky from a legal standpoint unless you’ve taken the photographs yourself
and have a signed release from the person (or people) featured within each
photograph. If you use someone else’s photos, you need the photographer’s
permission, as well as permission from the people in the photo. If the photo
depicts someone’s private property, make sure to secure permission from the
property owner to use the photograph, even if you took the actual picture.
If you use stock photos (see “What Meets the Eye: Adding Visual Interest to
Your Manuscript” earlier in the chapter), for a low flat fee, you can use images
with no formal releases or fear of copyright infringements.
Aside from photographs, you also need permission to use any type of copy-
righted artwork within your book. This includes drawings, graphics, logos,
charts, illustrations, or icons that were created by someone else.
The concept of fair use
Depending on what type of material you wish to use within your book, if you
provide the appropriate credit, you may be able to use copyrighted content
without obtaining written permission. This concept is called fair use and applies
when you use a small portion of another source (no more than 300 words).
You’re also allowed, from a legal standpoint, to quote information from press
releases issued by companies or individuals.

You’re Not a Copier: Avoiding Plagiarism
Plagiarism occurs when you steal someone else’s words, ideas, or materials
and call them your own without giving the person you stole the material from
proper credit. In the publishing world, this offense is a major no-no and can
lead to costly lawsuits and also destroy your professional reputation.
You need to properly document your source(s) whenever you refer to or
make use of any of the following information within your book:
 Quoting from another book, a newspaper or magazine article, TV or
radio show, lyrics from a song, a blog, Web page, advertisement, or
someone’s words from any other published or electronic medium
 Quoting someone you’ve interviewed either in person or on the phone
 Quoting someone after attending a press conference, lecture, or speech
 Reproducing any type of artwork or graphic image
It is not considered plagiarism when you’re writing about your own ideas,
observations, experiences, and knowledge or when forming your own conclu-
sions about a subject matter or topic. You’re also allowed to make full use of
what is considered common knowledge or generally accepted facts.
Check out these Web sites about plagiarism and copyright issues:

plagiarism is and how to avoid it

peoples’ copyrights

Fine-Tuning Your Work with
Careful Editing
In This Chapter
 Surveying the editing process
 Hiring a professional editor
W
ut wood you due if you purchased a book that wuz full of errors?
Wood you still respect wut the author had to say? Probably not!
A good writer not only strings together the right combination of words, sen-
tences, and paragraphs, but also they adhere to proper grammatical, spelling
and punctuation rules in their work. While writers should edit their own work
carefully before the book goes to press, they should also have the text profes-
sionally edited, especially with first-time authors looking to make the best
possible impression with their self-published books.
This chapter discusses why good editing is important, provides an overview
of the author’s and editor’s roles in the editing process, and explains how to
hire a freelance professional editor for your book project.
A Bird’s-Eye View of the Editing Process
When you hire a freelance editor, make sure that the editor is willing and capa-
ble of editing both the original manuscript you provide and the laid out pages
before they go to press. At a major publishing house, two different people 
perform these functions. The editor edits the original manuscript and then a
proofreader reviews the final pages before publication. To save money, hire
someone who handles both of these important jobs for you.
A poorly edited manuscript can destroy a reader’s appreciation and enjoy-
ment of your work and take away from the overall professionalism of the 
publication. For a book to achieve its objectives, it should be written by a 
talented writer and reviewed by an equally talented editor. Authors and 
editors bring together unique skills and often work as a close-knit team.

Just as writing is a skill so is editing. Editing requires strong knowledge of
grammar and punctuation rules and a command of the English language. It
also requires extreme attention to detail as every line of the manuscript is
reviewed. Without this proper editing pass, a book can easily contain a wide
range of errors. As you review your manuscript, some of the more common
errors you, as well as your editor, should look out for include
 Factual errors
 Grammatical errors
 Improper page numbering
 Improper use of punctuation
 Incorrect names, phone numbers, addresses, or Web site URLs
 Mismatched figures and captions
 Mistakes in chapter titles or subtitles
 Page layout and design errors, such as the wrong font, typestyle, type
size, or paragraph formatting
 Incorrect references to specific page numbers, figures, or chapters
 Spelling mistakes
 The accidental deletion of content
 Typos, such as using a wrong word that the spelling checker didn’t
catch like they’re instead of their
 Writing style mistakes, such as constantly switching between past and
present tense or first and third person
 Inconsistencies in fiction storylines when it comes to characters, plots,
and subplots
 Long sentences and paragraphs that can be broken up in order to make
your book more straightforward, objective, and easy to understand
In the following sections, I give you the lowdown on your role as the author in
editing and the tasks specifically performed by a professional editor.
Editing your own work first
As an author, you have a responsibility to review your manuscript several
times before turning it over to a professional editor. During one read through,
focus on content and make sure that the text flows smoothly. When you read
it the second and third times, focus more on the quality of the writing; on the
wording you’ve used; and on correcting spelling, grammatical, and punctua-
tion mistakes.
70
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

Follow these steps to focus your editing efforts:
1. Create a double-spaced print out of each chapter.
It’s often much easier to edit a hard copy of your work than it is to
review it on a computer screen. The double-spaced format allows room
for marking your corrections.
2. Grab a red pen (or any other contrasting color from your print out
color) to make corrections and start reading.
As you go back to make the corrections in your Word file, you want to
easily be able to spot them on the edited hard copy pages.
3. Focus on one chapter or section of the book at a time.
Editing takes time and requires your total focus. If you find your mind
wandering or you’re getting tired, take breaks in between chapters and
continue the editing process later. Never attempt to edit your entire
book in one sitting.
4. After you’ve reviewed your manuscript and have marked up the pages
with your edits, corrections, and changes, incorporate them into the
document using your word processor.
As you enter each correction or edit, review it and make sure that it
works in the context of the manuscript. Doing this provides you with an
additional opportunity to improve the overall quality of your work.
5. Create a fresh printout and review it again.
Each time you review your work, you may think of potential improve-
ments you can make to the content or flow of the manuscript. Perhaps
you can think of additional examples to include or realize that a specific
section doesn’t really belong in the book after all.
Never rely exclusively on your editor to fix all the mistakes in your manu-
script, especially those relating to the accuracy of information. Most editors
focus primarily on spelling, punctuation, grammatical and formatting mis-
takes, and structural and organizational issues, as opposed to actual content-
related issues.
Understanding an editor’s responsibilities
The editor focuses on the minute and technical details of a manuscript but
also maintains perspective for the bigger picture. Even experienced writers
sometimes make different types of mistakes and lose a sense of their book’s
overall structure, which is where a good editor can step in and take over.
71
Chapter 5: Fine-Tuning Your Work with Careful Editing

Editors aren’t hired for their knowledge of the topic but for their knowledge
of written language and how to best use it. The editor should understand the
publishing process and what’s required for a manuscript to be transformed
into a professionally published book. Therefore, it’s not necessary for the
editor to be an expert on the subject matter of the book (that’s your job) —
although a basic knowledge is often useful. You’re the expert in terms of the
content and information being conveyed, but look to your editor as an expert
at making sure the information is presented correctly.
Here are a few editor responsibilities:
 Reviewing your manuscript sentence-by-sentence
 Fixing the common spelling, punctuation, and grammatical mistakes
 Ensuring that the structure and organization of the entire manuscript
have a nice flow and rhythm
 Making sure that your manuscript is easy to understand and that the
writing style is straightforward
 Being objective and assisting the writer in fixing problem areas of the
manuscript before it goes to press
 Certifying that the finished product is truly welcoming for the reader
because a good book should draw the reader in to its subject, and to
reach that goal, the writer and editor both need to be aware of the 
audience
 Checking the continuity in terms of the information, whether you’re writ-
ing fiction or nonfiction
One important aspect of an editor’s job is to make sure that all information 
is provided in a logical sequence, so the reader can understand it. Even if a
book is easy to read, it doesn’t mean that the subject matter has to be simple.
A well-written and edited book can take extremely complex or technical infor-
mation and clearly state it for the reader.
All authors and editors have their own style for how they work. So before you
begin working with the editor you hire, decide if you want to supply a hard
copy printout of the manuscript or a Word (electronic) document, and then
develop a plan for how the work is edited. After that, answer the following
questions:
 Do you provide the entire manuscript at once or supply the editor with
several batches of chapters at different times?
 Do you plan to have the editor review and edit your work multiple
times?
 Does the editor also take responsibility for proofreading the final pages
before your book goes to press?
72
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

When a professional editor corrects your manuscript, she often uses special
symbols and terms associated with publishing. The following Web site, 
published by the University of Colorado, offers a listing of popular editing
terms and symbols: www.colorado.edu/Publications/styleguide/
symbols.html. Make sure that you understand the editor’s comments and
corrections before deciding whether to implement them.
When using a word processor, an editor can utilize the Track Changes feature
of the program to make collaborating on the same document easier. The
editor’s comments and edits, for example, can be color coded for your review.
If your editor uses these Word features, make sure that you understand how to
use the commands available to you under the Track Changes pulldown menu.
After your editor reviews your manuscript for the first time, don’t be sur-
prised if he comes back with many proposed changes. You’re probably
extremely attached to your work, but you need to trust the editor enough to
allow him to improve your text. These suggestions aren’t a personal attack on
your writing skills. The editor is simply doing his job: transforming your man-
uscript into the most professionally written book possible.
The Nitty-Gritty of Hiring an Editor
Hiring your book’s editor and proofreader (who can ultimately be the same
person) are important steps in the publishing process. A highly skilled editor
can dramatically improve the quality of your book, especially if you’re a first-
time author. The following sections help you hire the perfect editor for your
book and develop a strong and productive working relationship with that
person.
When should you hire an editor, and 
how long should the editing take?
Depending on your level of writing experience, hire your editor early in the
writing process and submit individual chapters to the editor as you write
them. Trickling the chapters to your editor allows more time for feedback
and helps you keep your manuscript organized and properly structured.
If you’re a first time author or your writing skills don’t meet professional stan-
dards, trickling chapters is extremely important because it allows you to get
some feedback. By receiving feedback from your editor as you’re writing, you
can cut down on the edits and rewrites that may be required in later chapters
and before the book goes to press.
73
Chapter 5: Fine-Tuning Your Work with Careful Editing

If you’re confident in your writing ability, and you have other people (such as
friends, family members, coworkers, and professional colleagues) who can
review your manuscript as you’re writing to provide impartial and objective
feedback, hold off on hiring an editor until your manuscript is complete.
After the manuscript is finished, allow several weeks for your editor to prop-
erly review the entire project and complete the editing process. Depending
on how busy the editor is, the length of your manuscript and the quality of
your writing, allocate three to five weeks in your overall publishing timeline
for proper editing of the manuscript to be done.
To ensure that you find the best editor possible and are able to give that
person ample time to properly do her job, line up your editor as far in
advance as possible. When you begin writing your manuscript, or at least
several weeks before you need the editor to start working, begin your 
search to hire the appropriate person.
Avoid waiting to the last minute to hire your editor, or you can wind up having
difficulty finding someone who has time to take on your project or who winds
up having to rush to get your manuscript edited. If an editor tells you that he
can edit your entire manuscript in a few days or over a weekend, run in the
opposite direction as fast as you can. Find someone else. The editing process
takes time and careful attention to detail. This step isn’t something that you
want to rush or cut corners on.
How much should hiring an editor cost?
As with any professional service, when you hire an experienced editor, you’re
paying for time, skills, experience, and knowledge. Plan on spending any-
where from $1,500 to $5,000 to have your book-length manuscript profession-
ally edited. A book-length manuscript can be anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000
or more words, depending on the type of book. A children’s book, cookbook,
or poetry book may be significantly shorter.
Some editors charge a flat rate for a project, while others charge an hourly
fee for their time, or they charge by the word for their editing services. (A
price of two cents to five cents per word for a 50,000- to 100,000-word manu-
script is common.) The price you pay for editing services depends on many
factors:
 The length of your manuscript
 How much work the editor anticipates having to do on the manuscript
 How closely you work with the editor during the writing process
 The editor’s current workload
 How quickly you need the editing work done
74
Part I: Do It Yourself: Getting Started with Self-Publishing 

After the manuscript is fully edited, have the editor review the galleys (the
laid out pages) of your book again right before the book goes to press. This
extra check helps you catch any typos or formatting mistakes made by who-
ever handled the page layout and design of your book. Be sure to check all
chapter titles and subtitles for accuracy, and make sure that all figures and
captions are correctly matched up and placed within the book.
Where can you find an experienced editor?
When it comes time to finding a professional editor to work with you on your
project, you have a multitude of choices, but the best way to find someone is
through a referral from someone working in the publishing industry. If you
don’t know anyone firsthand, consider the following options:
 Call the editor of your local newspaper
 Contact members of a local writer’s group
 Use an online service
• Elance (www.elance.com)
• Freelance Work Exchange (www.freelanceworkexchange.com)
• Manuscript Editing (www.manuscriptediting.com)
 Respond to classified ads in special-interest magazines for writers
• The Writer Magazine (www.writermag.com/wrt)
• Writer’s Digest (www.writersdigest.com)
• Publisher’s Weekly (www.publishersweekly.com)
Even when you work with a self-publishing company that offers a complete
solution for publishing your book (such as Trafford, iUniverse, or Wheatmark
as described in Chapter 11), editing isn’t provided with the basic services
offered. These companies, however, can refer you to a professional editor for
an additional fee. Make sure that you also allocate funds in your publishing
budget to hire an editor (see Chapter 6 for details about budgets).
Choose the person you hire carefully. Find an editor who’s experienced, well
educated, and one you’re able to work well with. Your editor should never try
to force his ideas, vision, writing style, or voice into your work. Find someone
who’s able to embrace your vision and who understands exactly what you’re
trying to accomplish with your book. The best way to find this person is to
set up a phone or in-person meeting with the editor and to discuss creden-
tials, approach to editing, and your concept for the book. Of course, you also
want to discuss fees and scheduling early on.
75
Chapter 5: Fine-Tuning Your Work with Careful Editing

Editing is a technical skill. Ideally, you want to hire an editor who’s studied
editing and/or journalism at an undergraduate or graduate level and who has
experience editing full-length manuscripts for the general trade book market.
Most professional freelance editors have no trouble providing you with their
credentials and a list of published books they’ve worked on in the past.
Thanks to technology, like e-mail, fax, and the telephone, along with
overnight mail services, it’s not necessary for the editor you hire to be
located near you. Most editors are extremely comfortable working with
authors by exchanging e-mails and phone calls.
Do you also need a technical editor?
When hiring a technical editor, find someone who’s extremely familiar with
the topic or subject matter of your book and who’s able to focus on the accu-
racy of information. This suggestion is particularly important if the copy
editor you’re using isn’t too familiar with the subject matter of your book.
A technical editor’s job can be time consuming and requires careful attention
to the content-related details within your book. The focus is less on the accu-
racy spelling, punctuation, grammar, and writing style. A technical editor is
someone who does the following:
 Fact checks the book’s information
• Phone numbers
• Addresses
• Web site URLs
• Names
 Ensures complete content
• Facts
• Figures
• Statistics
• Research materials
• Cited works
Hiring a technical editor does come with its cons: It adds to the budget, and
you get a more technically detailed or complex manuscript than you were
hoping for, therefore developing creative differences.

Chapter 5: Fine-Tuning Your Work with Careful Editing
Meet a professional editor
For over 20 years, Beth Adelman has been
working as a freelance professional editor.
She’s edited hundreds of books published by
major publishing houses and many other books
written by self-published authors. She has a
journalism degree and began her career work-
ing as a writer for newspapers and magazines.
She quickly determined, however, that her inter-
ests lied in the publishing process as a whole
and found editing to be far more rewarding. “An
editor is a coach and mentor for writers, not just
someone who fixes spelling mistakes and punc-
tuation,” she explains.
Adelman works from a home office and edits
books on a wide range of subjects. She adds,
“My job as an editor is to make sure that the
writer ultimately puts his or her name on the
best possible work that it can be. I very often
begin working with writers before their manu-
script is finished, so I am able to be an active
resource for the writer to bounce ideas off of.
When a manuscript is finished, it’s my job to
read it and to work with the author to make sure
that the finished product is written clearly and
presented in a way that makes sense.”
As an editor, Adelman must always work using
the voice of the writer. “The hand of a good editor
is always invisible to the reader,” she explains.
“Generally, I rewrite paragraphs that don’t make
sense, but if there are large sections of the book
that require major revisions, I go back to the
author and provide them with extremely detailed
feedback on what needs to be done. As a writer,
I have my own very distinctive writing style. As
an editor, I need to perfectly match the author’s
writing style. In essence, when I am editing
someone else’s book, I need to pretend I am the
author and communicate using his or her voice
and style. This process becomes more challeng-
ing, however, when an author has no unique
voice or style.”
The most common mistake Adelman sees when
authors attempt to edit their own work is a lack of
perspective. “When writers review their own
work, they always think it’s perfect. They love
their own work. The problem is, nobody writes
perfectly, but if you love your work, it’s impossible
to see the flaws. Authors and writers get overly
attached to their work and lose perspective. Plus,
when authors write something, in their head, they
understand what they meant. Thus, it’s much
harder for them to look at just the words on the
page and determine if their ideas are being com-
municated properly. This reason is why a profes-
sional editor should be used,” she says.
Just about everyone working in the book pub-
lishing business agrees that every book should be
edited by a professional before it goes to press.
If, for whatever reason, you choose not to follow
this advice and you decide to edit your own man-
uscript, Adelman strongly suggests putting the
manuscript in a drawer for a week or two after it’s
complete before beginning the editing process.
“Putting the manuscript away for a while helps
you regain your perspective before you begin
editing. If you don’t hire a professional editor,
make sure that you have at least several people
read the manuscript before it goes to press.
Some writers belong to a writer’s group where
the members provide feedback to each other. If
you pursue this route, don’t get overly caught up
in trying to include the advice offered by each
member of the group. If you have six different
opinions and try to incorporate all of them into
your book, the manuscript begins to lack coher-
ence. Take the advice you’re offered into
account, but in the end, make sure that you stay
true to your vision.”
When it comes time for an author to work with
an editor, Adelman adamantly states that the
relationship has to be based on mutual respect
and trust for the collaboration to work. A good
author working with a good editor is a formula
for success.

The cost of a technical editor is considerably less than what it costs to hire a
copy editor. Plan on spending anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $2,500,
depending on the length of your manuscript and the type of work involved.
When trying to find a technical editor, check out these resources:
 The same Web sites or resources you used to find your editor and/or
proofreader (see “Where can you find an experienced editor?” earlier in
this chapter)
 Someone who’s also an expert on the topic you’re writing about
 Industry trade magazines
When interviewing a potential technical editor, focus on their knowledge of
the topic and their willingness to fact check and do any research necessary
to ensure that the information in your book is accurate.

n conjunction with the publication of your book, estab-
lishing your own small publishing company may make
sense for many self-published authors. Starting a com-
pany offers a variety of benefits. This part helps you handle
many book-specific tasks that are necessary before a book
goes to press. It also helps you establish your company and
assists you in making sure that your book’s interior and
cover look as professional as possible.

A
s you begin to prepare your book for publication, depending on how
you market, advertise, and sell it, and what involvement you have in
those processes, you may find establishing your own publishing company
very beneficial. This chapter focuses on the benefits of establishing your own
business, offers basic advice on how actually to get started, advises you on
watching your budget, and provides tips for finding expert help.
As a self-published author with only one book title, you may need to establish
and operate your business only for the life of the book. Unless you plan to
follow up with additional book titles, eventually, the sales from the original
book title typically fizzle out.
Understanding the Benefits of
Establishing a Publishing Company
Establishing a business offers a variety of tax advantages and potential legal
protections. Your accountant and attorney are able to review these benefits
with you, based on the state where you’re establishing your business and
based on your personal situation. Here are a few general benefits:

 Credibility: In terms of actually selling your book, obtaining publicity,
buying advertising, and coordinating distribution, a legitimate company
gives you credibility.
 Loans: You can qualify for small business loans or grants. In fact, it’s also
easier to obtain a small business loan if you actually operate a legitimate
business.
 Location: Most self-publishing businesses can be operated from a home
or apartment as opposed to an office or warehouse. Although it’s neces-
sary to legally establish your business and submit the appropriate forms
to the state and federal government (see “Legally establishing the right
type of business,” later in this chapter), you don’t need to rent office
space, especially if you’re running a one- or two-person operation. (But
consider opening a post office box to keep your personal and business
mail separate.)
 Tax deductions: By establishing a company, most or all of your legiti-
mate business-related expenses are tax deductible.
Not all self-published authors need to create their own business. For 
example, if you’re writing a book that’s going to be published using Print-
On-Demand (POD), establishing your own business may not be necessary.
(Chapter 11 has details on POD publishing.) But, if you’re a self-published
author who wants to sell your own books, now may be a good time to estab-
lish your own business. (Part V has more information about publicity and
marketing tactics.)
Prior to establishing any type of formal business, be sure to consult with an
accountant and attorney who can review your situation and help you deter-
mine the best type of legal business entity to create.
Taking Official Steps to 
Create a Company
Starting an actual business doesn’t have to be expensive or require a pile 
of paperwork, but you want to establish your business as early in the self-
publishing process as possible, especially if you’re ultimately selling your
book directly to consumers. This section helps you take the necessary steps
to establish your business.

Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

Starting with a name and an image
Because you’re about to launch a business to self-publish and sell your book,
you already have an overall objective for your business (see the next section
for developing a more detailed business plan). Now, you need to come up
with a business name. Go ahead; think of something that’s unique and catchy.
The name you choose helps establish your company’s image. The name
needs to sound professional, hold meaning (at least to you), and establish
your credibility in the publishing field. The name can be either specific or
general:
 If you know you’re publishing only travel books, name your company
something such as Acme Travel Adventure Publications.
 John Doe Enterprises, Inc. incorporates the owner’s name yet doesn’t
reveal anything about what the company actually does.
If you’re providing other services in addition to publishing books, you may
want to reference this within the name of your company, or at least refrain
from implying in the company’s name that it’s exclusively a publishing com-
pany. A name like Acme Publishing, Inc. implies the company is a publishing
company. Acme Ventures, Inc., Acme Worldwide, Inc., or Acme Enterprises,
Inc. is less specific.
After you’ve come up with a name, you want to do a few things to protect and
promote your company:
 Register the company name as a DBA (doing business as). You need to
ensure that no one else is already using your name. Contact your local
County Clerk or Recorder’s Office for details on how to complete this
process. You need a DBA to establish a bank account or a P.O. Box.
 Register your name as a Web site domain name. Even if you don’t have
a site designed yet, reserve the name for your site, so no one else takes
it from you. See Chapter 21 for more information on this process.
 Develop a logo to promote your identity and image. A logo is a graphic
that accompanies your company name, and many people first identify
your logo with your company. Any graphic artist can help you create a
logo, which you can use on all your promotional materials. See Chapter
8 for details on finding a graphic designer.
83
Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Self-Publishing Business

Developing a business plan 
and securing financing
The company you establish most likely handles the book’s marketing, adver-
tising, distribution, order fulfillment, and other business-related matters. So,
it’s important to create a well-thought-out business plan for the company
you’re about to establish. In a nutshell, you need to develop a thorough
understanding of what the business does. Does the company simply help 
you sell books? Or does the company serve to forward your own career?
The business plan
Before investing your time and money in your business and into the publish-
ing of your book, create a detailed business plan that specifically defines
your business, identifies its goals, and describes how the business operates.
Be sure to include a balance sheet and cash flow analysis as part of the 
business plan. For more on business plans, check out Business Plans For
Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) by Paul Tiffany and Steven D. Peterson.
If you don’t have a financial background, consider hiring (in advance) an
accountant or bookkeeper — someone with the expertise to help you create
a financial model for your company (which you may later need to secure a
loan or pitch to investors) and help you set up the financial aspects of your
business. The following people can help you with this process:
 An accountant
 A Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
 A financial planner
 A professional bookkeeper
84
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 
Making your mark
If you’re using a unique or original company
name or if you’ve developed a company logo
along with the name, be sure to trademark the
name and logo with the United States Patent
and Trademark Office (www.uspto.gov).
Obtaining a trademark for your unique company
name and logo gives you added legal protection
and helps keep your competition from using a
similar name or logo to confuse consumers.
Keep in mind, you can trademark any unique
logo, but to trademark a company name, it has
to include something special, such as a made-
up word or unique spelling of a word. You can’t
trademark words that appear in the dictionary,
for example. Consult with an attorney or the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office to find out more
about what can and can’t be trademarked.

The money
After you have your business plan and financial planning in place, you have
to get some money to run that business of yours! The type of business you’re
forming and the purpose of the business determine how much money you
need. Plan on spending at least several hundred dollars to complete and file
the necessary paperwork to establish your business. Beyond that, the costs
associated with writing, editing, printing, promoting, selling, and distributing
your book need to be calculated into your budget.
Where do you get the money? Try getting a small business loan or borrowing
money from family or friends. You can even look at private investors. Of
course, if you have money in your savings, you can start there!
Obtaining cash advances on your credit cards to launch your business can be
a costly choice. If the business fails and you can’t pay at least your monthly
credit card minimum payments, you can find yourself in serious financial
trouble and having to pay extremely high interest rates and other fees.
Legally establishing the 
right type of business
When it comes to actually creating your business or company, you have a
variety of options. Some common types of businesses include
 Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship means that you’re the exclu-
sive owner of the business. It’s the most inexpensive way of creating a
legal business entity, and it’s the quickest and easiest way to start. As
your business grows, you can transform the company into some type of
corporation, for example. If you have a small publishing program and it
only breaks even, it’s easy to remain a one-person company indefinitely.
But successful sales of a title (25,000 copies sold in one year) dictate
that you either expand into a company with employees or sell off the
successful property to a larger publisher.
Be careful with this type of business because it offers fewer legal protec-
tions and benefits. When you operate a sole proprietorship, all profits
and losses are included on your individual tax returns. If a customer
sues your business, he may also be able to sue you personally, which
makes your personal and business assets subject to those claims.
 Partnership: When two or more people work together as co-owners of a
company, this business is referred to as a partnership. It’s like a sole pro-
prietorship, but multiple people are involved, which increases the com-
plexity and the amount of required paperwork.
85
Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Self-Publishing Business

Keep in mind that partners in a business share unlimited liability: Each
partner is usually responsible for the acts of the other. Also, if someone
sues your business, he may also be able to sue you and your partner(s)
personally, which makes your assets subject to those claims.
 Corporation: For the maximum amount of legal protection and potential
tax benefits, establishing a corporation may be in your best interest. A
corporation is a legal entity. All business-related liabilities are held by the
corporation. This practice minimizes the personal liability of its owners.
The corporation operates as a business and can be owned wholly or par-
tially based on registered certificates, called stock. Some major steps
required to set up a corporation include
• Filing an application for a legal name
• Paying a corporate franchise fee to the state in which you file
• Appointing a board of directors and corporate officers
• Keeping minutes of periodic meetings of the board
Check your individual state’s rules and regulations for setting up a 
corporation.
 S corporation: This type of corporation offers many of the same advan-
tages as a regular corporation. But, unlike a corporation, it’s treated for
income tax purposes as a flow-through entity. This means that as a com-
pany, it pays no income taxes. Instead, all income and losses are
reported individually by the owners or stockholders on their personal
income tax returns. If your new business has fewer than 35 stockhold-
ers, consult with your accountant and attorney about this option.
 Limited Liability Corporation (LLC): When this type of corporation is
created, income is distributed among partners, but the partners aren’t
usually personally liable for the corporation’s debts. Therefore, the per-
sonal assets of the company’s owners are generally protected. Only the
money that’s invested into the company by the owners can be lost.
There are many kits, books, and online services that allow you to form your
own corporation in minutes for a flat fee. But you may want to seek the guid-
ance of a lawyer to help you with this process to ensure that it’s done correctly
(especially completing and filing the correct paperwork) and that you’ve made
the best decisions based on your personal situation. The paperwork that needs
to be filed varies dramatically by state.
Organizing your office
After your business exists and is operational, you discover that whether
you’re operating from home or an office building, you need to make a finan-
cial investment in office supplies and equipment. The following sections 
provide a sampling of the equipment you need to get started.
86
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

Writers need a lot of the same tools that business operators need, long
before they even consider starting a self-publishing company. The most
important tools are the following:
 A computer with Internet access
 A combination printer/scanner/fax machine and their supplies
 A telephone with home service and/or cellular service
I cover these items in detail in Chapter 3.
The right computer software
Your computer may be your most important business tool. Figure out what
types of applications you need to run on your computer, and then make sure
that you purchase a PC or Mac-based machine powerful enough to handle
those applications.
Having your computer connected to the Internet via a high-speed DSL or
Broadband connection is a necessity. After you have the right software 
and capabilities, use your computer to perform your major tasks:
 Bookkeeping
 Handling your business’s finances
 Inventory management
 Laying out and designing your book
 Managing a Web site
 Managing and editing electronic photography
 Research
 Sending/receiving e-mail
 Surfing the Web
 Writing
Chapter 8 has the scoop on design and photo software. Chapter 16 has details
on software related to warehousing, order fulfillment, and shipping. Head to
Chapter 21 for info on Web site design. For software suitable for running a
small business, try QuickBooks Premier Edition (www.quickbooks.com).
Other tools and resources you need
To do your daily business operations, you need a wide range of basic office
supplies. In addition to visiting your local office supply superstore, you often
find low prices by shopping online for items such as toner cartridges for your
printer and fax machine.
87
Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Self-Publishing Business

Some of the supplies you may want in your office include the following:
 Answering machine (if you don’t have voicemail)
 Bookshelves
 Briefcase and pad/paper folio
 Business cards and stationery, including letterhead and business-size
envelopes
 Calculator
 Cassette or microcassette recorder (or a digital recorder)
 CD-ROMs (blank)
 Copier and supplies
 Credit card processing equipment (if you sell directly to customers)
 Desk and chair(s)
 File cabinets and folders for organization and storage
 Label printer
 Paperclips
 Paper shredder
 Pencils, pens, and paper
 Postage machine, postage scale, and other shipping materials
(envelopes, packing tape, labels, and so on)
 Power strips and extension cords
 Ruler/tape measure
 Scissors and tape
 Stapler and staples
 Wastepaper basket
Here are a few additional tips to consider as you finish setting up your office:
 Set up accounts with shipping companies. After your company is estab-
lished, contact companies such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, and/or the U.S. Post
Office. If you fulfill your own book orders, setting up in-house warehouse,
inventory control, and shipping departments are essential. (See Chapter
16 for details on fulfillment, warehousing, and shipping.)
 Subscribe to publishing trade magazines. These publications keep you
informed about news in the publishing industry and provide valuable
how-to articles on a range of topics. Check out these Web sites:
• www.bookmarketingupdate.com

• www.publishersweekly.com
• www.writersdigest.com
 Acquire adequate insurance for yourself and your business. If disaster
strikes, not being adequately insured can quickly put you out of busi-
ness and cause serious financial hardship. Protect your assets from
theft, fire, lawsuits, and other disasters by obtaining homeowner’s insur-
ance (if your business is run from home) that covers all your equipment,
inventory, and other business assets. In terms of your personal insur-
ance, consider obtaining health insurance, life insurance, long-term dis-
ability insurance, and an umbrella insurance policy.
Consult with several insurance companies and independent insurance
brokers to determine your needs and find the best deals for the most
comprehensive coverage.
Keeping Costs Tracked 
and Under Control
The success of your business and publishing venture depends on your ability
to manage your money and generate a profit. Allocate the money that you
spend wisely. Focus on your company’s objectives and how to best use your
available funds to achieve those objectives. One of the biggest mistakes start-
up company operators make is misallocating their money, so they run out of
operating funds before their company is able to turn a profit.
Listing your expenses
Successfully launching and running your own business involves many start-
up costs. Some of the initial business expenses you need to budget for
include
 Accounting services
 Answering service
 Banking fees
 Business licenses and filing fees (including fees for incorporating)
 Insurance
 Internet service
89
Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Self-Publishing Business

 Legal services
 Merchant account establishment
 Office equipment and furniture, including computers and software
 Office supplies
 Phone service and equipment
 Postage meter rental
 Professional association membership fees and dues
 Subscriptions to publishing trade magazines
 Warehouse (storage) rental fees
In addition to these business costs, create a budget for your actual publish-
ing project. Some of the upfront expenses you have that relate to the develop-
ment and publication of your book include the following:
 Writing (hiring a ghost writer, if necessary; see Chapter 4)
 Editing (see Chapter 5)
 Obtaining the copyright, ISBN #, Library of Congress Card Number, and
barcode for your book (see Chapter 7)
 Photography/artwork (see Chapter 4)
 Page layout and design (see Chapter 8)
 Front and back book cover design (see Chapter 9)
 Printing (see Part III)
 Order fulfillment/warehousing/shipping (see Chapter 16)
 Marketing and public relations (see Chapters 18 and 19)
 Advertising (see Chapter 20)
 Web site development and maintenance (see Chapter 21)
Formulating a budget
Figure 6-1 is an example of a budget worksheet to help you keep track of vari-
ous costs. For each type of business expense, this worksheet allows you to
calculate your monthly expenses (if applicable), as well as your total or
annual costs. You can adjust the categories to fit your particular project.

Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

As you plan your business’ operating budget for its first six months and then
for one year of operation (it’s best to complete a six-month budget and a one-
year budget, which incorporates the 6-month budget), allow for unexpected
expenses and have money available to deal with them.
Your accountant (get one if you don’t have one) helps you properly budget
for all your anticipated and potentially unexpected expenses. Ideally, you
want to launch your business with enough money in the bank to operate for
at least six months without generating any revenue. Update your budget as
needed based on how the business grows and develops over time. It’s an
ongoing process.
Many costs are associated with successfully writing, editing, laying out, 
printing, distributing, marketing, advertising, and fulfilling orders for a self-
published book. Establishing a proper budget like the one in Figure 6-1 and
then carefully managing your finances help ensure your success:
 Have an adequate accounting and recordkeeping system in place (see
“The right computer software” earlier in this chapter for some ideas).
 Maintain at least a monthly current balance sheet and income statement
(a profit-and-loss statement) along with accurate banking records is
important for keeping your business on track financially.
Finding Additional Expert Advice 
on Your Business Adventure
When you first came up with the idea to write and publish a book, you 
probably didn’t realize that you can also be a small business operator. Well,
in addition to becoming an author and figuring out how to publish a book
successfully, if you plan to launch a business, you need to understand the
fundamentals of business administration.
If you’ve absolutely no experience working in the business world, don’t panic.
First, focus on writing and publishing the very best book you can. Then, con-
sider seeking the help of someone who can help you set up and potentially
manage your business to compensate for your lack of experience. In addition
to the folks and resources that I mention throughout the rest of this chapter,
you can try the following sources:
 Credit-card companies: Both American Express (home.american
express.com/home/open.shtml) and Visa (www.usa.visa.com/
business) operate Web sites that cater to small business owners.
These Web sites are chock-full of helpful articles, links to resources, 
and online-based tools.
93
Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Self-Publishing Business

 Professional trade associations: These organizations typically offer sig-
nificant discounts on services and equipment, networking benefits, and
informational resources. Consider joining the following publishing indus-
try trade associations:
• Small Publishers, Artists, and Writers Network (SPAWN): SPAWN
is a professional association offering resources, advice, and ser-
vices to self-published authors. Visit the organization’s Web site 
at www.spawn.org or call (818) 886-4281. Membership dues are
$45 per year.
• Independent Book Publishers Association (PMA): With over 4,000
publishers represented, PMA (www.pma-online.org) is the
largest, nonprofit trade association in the country, which repre-
sents small and independent publishers. This organization can
help you establish your business, acquire a merchant account, 
and obtain discounts on book publishing and marketing services.
Annual dues are about $110 per year.
• The Small Publishers Association of North America (SPAN): For
self-published authors and small publishers, SPAN (www.spannet.
org) is an organization that’s well worth joining. Through publica-
tions, conferences, the Web site, and a wide range of other tools,
SPAN is dedicated to advancing the interests and expertise of 
independent publishers through educational opportunities and
discounted services. You can also reach SPAN by dialing (719)
475-1726. Dues are $105 per year.
 Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE): Although you can hire
someone with experience as a partner or employee, a cheaper option is to
take advantage of the free resources available to small business owners
from SCORE. As a nonprofit association comprised of over 12,000 volun-
teers from across the country, SCORE is a division of the Small Business
Administration (SBA) and is dedicated to aiding in the formation, growth,
and success of small businesses nationwide. SCORE volunteers are
trained to serve as counselors, advisors, and mentors to aspiring entre-
preneurs and business owners.
SCORE volunteers in your area can be reached by calling (800) 634-0245
or by visiting the organization’s Web site (www.score.org), which
offers a variety of free resources to small business operators

Tackling Book-Specific Tasks
In This Chapter
 Receiving an ISBN and a barcode for your book
 Completing Advance Book Information forms
 Applying for a Library of Congress Control Number
 Securing the copyright for your work
 Establishing your book’s cover price
 Picking a publication date
I
f you look at any commercially available book, the back cover lists the
book’s International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and barcode, along
with the book’s price. Within the front matter of your book (right after the
title page inside your book), you typically find the copyright page, which lists
legal information, including the book’s copyright notice and the Library of
Congress Control Number (LCCN).
This chapter focuses on how to obtain this information, which is exclusive to
your book. I also show you how to select a proper publication date for your
book and how to fill out Advance Book Information (ABI) forms.
Not all self-published authors have to handle these administrative tasks on
their own. In many cases, your Print-On-Demand (POD) publisher or tradi-
tional book printer obtains the necessary ISBN, barcode, LCCN, and copy-
right, on your behalf. See Chapter 10 for more about traditional printers and
Chapter 11 for details on POD publishing.
This chapter contains a bunch of legal stuff that may at first seem confusing.
Don’t despair! In addition to the information here, you may want to check out
the Internet to for easy-to-understand resources. You can also seek help from
an attorney or book printer that has experience in the areas covered in this
chapter. Worst case scenario: You attend law school for three years and then
self-publish your book (but chances are it won’t come to that).

Obtaining an ISBN for Your Book
Any book that’s sold anywhere in the world must have a unique ISBN. The 
following sections describe what an ISBN is, what the number signifies, why
your book needs to have one, and how to obtain it.
An ISBN: What it is and why 
your book needs one
The ISBN system is an internationally recognized book identification system
that’s been in use since 1970. An ISBN is used for a variety of purposes,
including inventory control; sales tracking; and order processing by book-
sellers, wholesalers, distributors, libraries, and universities. It’s currently a
10-digit number, divided into four parts of variable length, with each part 
separated by a hyphen.
Some books have similar titles, or the same book may have multiple editions
published over several years. To help keep track of every edition of every
book that’s published, each book is given a unique ISBN, which starting in
January 2007 will be 13 digits long instead of 10 (see the nearby sidebar for
details). The ISBN is displayed on the back cover and inside the book’s interior
on the copyright page (and sometimes on the inside front or back cover as
well).
The five parts of an ISBN-13 offer the following information:
 The new prefix: This three-digit number (currently 978 or 979) identifies
the book industry.
 Group of country identifier: This section indicates the country where
the book was published.
 Publisher identifier: This part of the number is a unique code given to
every individual publishing company (see the next section for more on
this code).
 Title identifier: This part of the ISBN is unique to every book and identi-
fies the particular title or edition of that title.
 Check digit: This single digit at the end of the ISBN validates the
number. In some cases, this could be the capital letter ‘X’ (the Roman
numeral for the number 10).

Publishers who want to find out more about implementing the new 13-digit
ISBNs can check out the following two sources:
 Download the free guide Guidelines for the Implementation of 13-Digit
ISBNs at www.isbn-international.org/en/download/

The International ISBN Agency.
 Download the free, 21-page eBook ISBN-13 For Dummies, Special Edition
(Wiley) at www.bisg.org/isbn-13/ISBN13_For_Dummies.pdf.
Without a proper ISBN, most places that sell books won’t be able to order or
sell yours.
How and when to register for an ISBN
Throughout the world, there are 160 ISBN agencies; each is responsible for
assigning unique ISBNs to new books published within a specific region. The
97
Chapter 7: Tackling Book-Specific Tasks
The ISBN undergoes a makeover
According to The ISBN Agency, the conversion
from 10-digit ISBNs to 13-digit ISBNs is being
done to accommodate the ever-expanding
number of books published each year. In 2005,
for example, more than 195,000 new titles and
editions were published.
For books published prior to January 2007, each
publisher needs to recalculate books’ ISBNs to
adhere to the new 13-digit numbering system.
It’s recommended that publishers print both the
10-digit and 13-digit ISBN on books published
during the potentially long transition.
Books published after January 2007 should use
the new ISBN-13 format exclusively. It looks
something like this: “ISBN-13: 978-1-873671-00-9,”
as opposed to the old format, which looks like
this: “ISBN-10: 1-873671-00-8.” The look of the
corresponding ISBN barcodes remains the same
but contains the new 13-digit numbers. (See
“Ordering a Barcode for Your Book,” later in this
chapter for more about barcodes.)
In addition, the new 13-digit numbers will be inte-
grated with the European Article Number (EAN)
system, which uniquely identifies every product
available for retail sale. This new numbering
system makes it easier to distribute books world-
wide and makes books more compatible with
inventory, sales tracking, and order systems that
currently use the 13-digit EAN system.
The new ISBN-13 system replaces the Bookland
EAN system, which has been in use since the
1980s. The Bookland EAN system was used by
retail inventory, ordering, and sales tracking sys-
tems not equipped to understand or utilize the
ISBN-10 system.

U.S. ISBN Agency (www.isbn.org) handles the United States, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Guam, and Puerto Rico.
It’s important to understand that if you’re using a POD publisher or a publisher
that offers a turnkey self-publishing solution to authors, that the publisher/
printer typically obtains an ISBN on your behalf. You only need to acquire your
own ISBN if you plan to self-publish your book entirely by yourself and estab-
lish your own publishing company to do this.
Only established book publishers can acquire ISBNs for books they publish. If
you’re self-publishing a book without the help of a POD publisher or another
type of turnkey publishing solution (as described in Chapter 11), you first
need to establish a publishing company; see Chapter 6 for details on doing
this task. As soon as you do that, contact the U.S. ISBN Agency.
Even if you represent a small publishing company planning to publish only
one or two book titles, you still need to acquire an ISBN publishing prefix,
along with a block of at least 10 ISBNs. This process takes approximately 15
business days; however, for an additional fee a Priority Processing (two-day)
or an Express (one-day) service is available.
To acquire an ISBN publisher prefix and purchase a block of ISBNs, you must
first complete and submit the appropriate form — Application for An ISBN
Publisher Prefix — to The U.S. ISBN Agency. This process can be done in a
couple of different ways:
 Online application: Visit www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/us/
secureapp.asp and fill your forms out online and submit immediately.
Online applications are free of charge.
 Printed forms: Visit www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/us/
printable/isbn.asp to download the printable forms. After you’ve
filled out the forms, send them via
• Mail: R.R. Bowker, 630 Central Avenue, New Providence, NJ 07974
• Fax: (908) 219-0188
• E-mail: isbn-san@bowker.com
There is a one-time application submission fee of $20 for submitting
paper forms.
Additional processing fees for either way of submission include a Publisher
Registration Fee for each block of ISBNs purchased: 10 ISBNs–$29.95; 100
ISBNs–$64.95; 1000 ISBNs–$179.95; 10,000 ISBNs–$399.95.
98
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

All fees are nonrefundable and can be paid using a major credit card, check,
or money order. In addition, ISBNs can’t be transferred, sold, or reassigned
because a portion of the 10- or 13-digit number represents the individual pub-
lishing company.
As of the printing of this book, the prices for obtaining a block of ISBNs from
the U.S. ISBN Agency with regular processing are as follows:
10 ISBNs: $240
100 ISBNs: $850
1,000 ISBNs: $1,250
10,000 ISBNs: $3,050
The cost of acquiring a publishing prefix and at least 10 ISBNs, along with the
fees associated with creating corresponding barcodes for each ISBN (see the
next section), should be calculated into your overall budget. See Chapter 6
for details on creating a budget for your publishing company.
After you’ve submitted your application, you’ll be asked for a wide range of
information about your publishing company:
 The company/publisher name
 The company/publisher address, phone number, fax number, e-mail
address, and Web site
 The name of the Rights and Permissions Contact within the company,
the person’s title, and phone number. (In most cases, this person is the
self-published author.)
 The name of the ISBN Coordinator within the company, the title, and
phone number. (In most cases, this person would be the self-published
author.)
 The year the company was founded and started publishing
 The type of products produced by the company (books, videos, soft-
ware, eBooks, spoken word cassettes/CDs)
 The company’s primary focus in terms of subject areas covered
 Information about how your products are distributed (see Part IV for
distribution details)
After you’ve obtained your ISBN publisher prefix and have assigned individ-
ual ISBNs to your upcoming books, each title can then be listed with Bowker’s
Books In Print, a comprehensive database and directory of all current and
99
Chapter 7: Tackling Book-Specific Tasks

upcoming books. This directory is used by booksellers, libraries, schools,
universities, and other institutions to search for and pre-order books and
decide what books they want to carry in advance of the publication date.
Check out the Web site at www.booksinprint.com.
Ordering a Barcode for Your Book
In conjunction with each ISBN issued for a book (see the previous section),
you can order a corresponding barcode (which prints on the back cover of
your book). The purpose of this barcode is primary for retail inventory con-
trol and sales. It’s made up of several parts. The primary barcode recreates
the book’s ISBN, while a secondary barcode recreates the book’s cover price.
You can see a barcode for yourself on this book’s back cover.
Obtain your barcode from Bowker Bar Code Service. The cost per barcode,
when ordered at the same time, is as follows:
 $25 for one to five barcodes
 $23 per barcode for six to 10 barcodes
 $21 per barcode for 11 to 100 barcodes
Each barcode comes in hardcopy, camera-ready, or digital format in 2400 dpi,
99.26 percent magnification. You receive a vanilla bar code (white back-
ground and black text) with accompanying price add-on. Contact Bowker Bar
Code Service (www.bowkerbarcode.com) for additional details.
The barcode that appears on your book follows a different format than a UPC
symbol that appears on retail products. The book publishing business uses
its own unique barcode system tied to each book’s ISBN. Many publishers
include the Price Code extension onto their barcode as well.
When designing your book’s back cover, the barcode must be positioned near
the bottom of the back cover and be accompanied by the book’s ISBN printed
in a readable font. The barcode should also appear on the inside front cover
of strippable paperback books. (When retailers return the books for credit,
they rip off the front cover of the book and send it back — hence the strip-
pable cover.) Chapter 9 has additional details on incorporating a barcode
into a back cover’s design.

A group decision: Including BISAC 
Subject and Audience information
Created by The Book Industry Study Group, a
professional trade association comprising com-
panies and individuals working in the publishing
industry, the BISAC Audience and BISAC
Subject are industry-standard categories that
your book should fit into. These classifications
help booksellers display your book in the appro-
priate section, based on subject matter and
target audience.
The BISAC Subject and/or BISAC Audience clas-
sifications for your book should be printed (in
small type) on the back cover of your book, either
near the barcode or in the upper-right or left
corner of the back cover. You also need this infor-
mation when submitting listings to online book-
sellers (see Chapter 15) and selling your book to
distributors or wholesalers (see Chapter 15).
For a comprehensive list of BISAC Subjects and
subcategories, point your Web browser 
to www.bisg.org/standards/bisac_
subject/major_subjects.html. 
In
addition to choosing a Subject that’s most appro-
priate for your book, you can further classify your
book using a subcategory. For example, a book
about Yorkshire Terriers fits into the subject Pets,
with the subcategory Dogs. Therefore, next to
the barcode on the book’s back cover, you see
“Pets/Dogs” printed.
BISAC Audience refers to the intended reader
for the book. Ideally, you should only use one
audience code for your book .Two industry stan-
dards exist for classifying books by audience,
including X.12 and Onix:
 Audience codes under the X.12 system
include COL (College), JUV (Juvenile), PSP
(Professional and Scholar), TRA (Trade),
and YA (Young Adult).
 The Onix Code has the following categories:
01 (General/Trade), 02 (Children/Juvenile),
03 (Young Adult), 04 (Primary & Secondary/
Elementary & High School), 05 (College/
Higher Education), 06 (Professional and
Scholarly), 07 (English as a Second
Language), and 08 (Adult Education).

BISAC Audience classifications, visit www.

Bowker (www.bowker.com). If you’re using a POD publishing service or
another turnkey self-publishing solution, the company or service you use
most likely obtains an ISBN on your behalf and completes the necessary ABI
paperwork to get your book listed.
If you’re handling ABI paperwork yourself, Bowker offers the online
BowkerLink service that allows publishers to create and update listings in
the company’s databases. This is a free service for registered publishers that
replaces ABI paper forms. To register for this service, click the Books In Print
icon found on the main page of the BowkerLink Web site (www.bowker
link.com), and then click Register. Only recognized publishing companies
are granted access to this service. After you establish a publishing company
(see Chapter 6 for details on doing this), complete the registration form and
you’re granted access to the service within three days. 
After you’re registered, select the Add Item icon to begin adding information
about specific book titles. After completing the online form, the information
is added to the Bowker Books In Print database within one to two business
days. Details about books should be added to the Books In Print database 
180 days prior to publication.
Information you need to provide about each book title to be listed in the
Books In Print database includes
 Audience
 Binding
 BISAC subject
 Description (25 to 200 words)
 ISBN
 Language
 Page count
 Price
 Publication date
 Publisher
 Publisher imprint (if applicable)
 Ship date
 Title and subtitle
 Trim size
Publishers have the option of including additional details about their book
titles, which the BowkerLink Web site prompts users to enter, if it’s applica-
ble. You can also include a cover image.

Securing a Library of Congress 
Control Number
The Library of Congress Control Number (LCCN) is a number assigned to
your book that’s used by libraries for numbering and cataloging books. The
system was implemented in 1898. This number includes the year of publica-
tion and a unique serial number for each book title. Make sure to obtain your
LCCN prior to the book’s publication, and then the number should appear on
the copyright page of your book.
There is no charge to obtain a LCCN. To get one, visit pcn.loc.gov and
complete the necessary form and mail it to Library of Congress, Cataloging in
Publication Division, 101 Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, D.C.
20540-4320. Your book needs an ISBN to participate in this program.
103
Chapter 7: Tackling Book-Specific Tasks
Can I have it? Cataloging in Publication
Major publishing houses use a Cataloging in
Publication (CIP) number, which serves the same
purpose as a LCCN but follows a slightly different
format. Books can have a CIP record filed with
the Library of Congress. This bibliographic infor-
mation consists of details about books that allow
libraries to catalog them quickly. Information
about a book’s title, publisher, author, trim size,
binding, copyright, and table of contents are
included. The bibliographic information is com-
piled from the book or manuscript itself, not from
forms submitted by the publisher.
Prior to a book’s publication, the full text of the
publication is electronically submitted to the
Library of Congress, which then creates an orig-
inal bibliographic record (CIP data). This data is
then returned to the publisher so it can be
included within the front matter of the book,
usually right after the title page.
At the same time, information about the book is
immediately available to each library that
acquires the book, which ultimately saves
librarians time and expense when it comes to
cataloging the book within their collections.
Librarians also use pre-publication data from
the Library of Congress to order books.
Here’s the kicker, though: Only U.S. publishers
that publish titles most likely to be widely
acquired by U.S. libraries are eligible to partici-
pate in the CIP program. Self-published authors
need to utilize the Control Number program,
which offers the same benefits in terms of
making information about your book readily
available to libraries across the country.
An alternate CIP is available to self-publishers
called Publisher’s Cataloguing in Publication
(PCIP) and provided for a fee by Quality Books,
Inc. Many independent publishers use PCIPs in
lieu of the standard; the PCIP contains the same
needed information to librarians. Librarians who
happen to know the LOC cataloguing system
can also write CIP data; it’s worth checking with
your local library to see if anyone knows cata-
loguing data and wants to pick up a freelance
job! You aren’t required by law to get CIP data
only from the LOC.

Most POD and turnkey self-publishing solutions handle acquiring the LCCN.
When researching which self-publishing solution to use (solutions covered in
Part III of this book), inquire if this service is automatically offered. If not, you
need to obtain a LCCN for your book.
It’s Mine, All Mine! Copyrighting 
Your Work
When you write a book, it’s an original literary work. You’re so proud of the
work that you’ve done, and you want to ensure that your work remains your
own and isn’t misused or stolen. Therefore, make sure to properly copyright
your book. As an author, you can copyright any original work, including liter-
ary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works.
The most important reason to copyright your work is so no one else can 
steal or plagiarize it (calling it their own and publishing it under their own
name). After a work is copyrighted, it’s protected for the life of the author,
plus 70 years. In some cases, the duration can be for 95 or even 120 years
after the author’s death. Contact the United States Copyright Office (www.
copyright.gov) for details on which situation applies to your book.
In the following sections, I show you how to create a copyright notice and
give you steps for registering your copyright.
Including a copyright notice in your book
All versions of your work should include a legal copyright notice. When your
book is formally published, the book’s copyright page typically goes right
after the title page as part of the book’s front matter; see Chapter 4 for more
details about the makeup of a copyright page.
A legal copyright notice should contain these three main elements:
 The copyright symbol — the letter c in a circle (“©”) or the word
Copyright
 The year of first publication
 The name of the owner of the copyright
A one-line copyright notice reads: © 2007 Jason R. Rich.
104
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

For details about creating the appropriate legal wording for your book’s copy-
right page, contact an attorney who specializes in copyright law and consult
with your book printer, who may also be able to provide guidance.
Registering your copyright
The purpose of actually registering your copyright (as opposed to just 
printing a copyright notice in your book) is to create a public record of your
book’s existence and to announce your ownership of the copyright. It also
establishes an official date when your ownership of the work began. To find
out more about the protections offered by filing the appropriate copyright
forms for your book, visit the Library of Congress Copyright Office’s Web site
at www.copyright.gov.
Registering the copyright for your book is a fast, inexpensive, and simple
process. Simply mail the following three elements (in the same envelope) to
The Library of Congress Copyright Office:
 A completed copyright application form. The appropriate form (which 
is “Form TX” for a literary work) can be obtained online (www.copy
right.gov) or by calling (202) 707-3000. The form must be completed
by the author or someone representing the author, such as the copy-
right claimant, the owner of exclusive rights to the manuscript, or a 
duly authorized agent of the author or copyright claimant.
 The nonrefundable fee of $30.
 A copy of your complete manuscript in hardcopy form. (This can be a
photocopy of your book’s manuscript.) If you wait until your book is
actually published to file your copyright, be sure to send in a printed
and bound copy of your book.
Mail your completed package to Library of Congress, Copyright Office, 101
Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, DC 20559-6000. Your registration
becomes effective on the day that the Copyright Office receives your applica-
tion package. However, receiving a written notification that the copyright is in
effect can take up to five months.
Send your copyright application package via U.S. Priority Mail with Signature
Confirmation or via an overnight courier (such as FedEx or UPS). You want to
be able to track the package and to prove it was received by the Copyright
Office.

Chapter 7: Tackling Book-Specific Tasks

Increasing Profits by Setting 
the Right Cover Price
Prior to printing your book and officially announcing its publication, you
need to set its cover price. This figure is the retail price of your book (the
cost readers pay to purchase it, either from you or from a bookseller).
Setting your book’s cover price is an important business decision that must
be made based on accurate market research, knowledge of the publishing
industry, and educated predictions for what you believe sales of your book
will be. Handling this aspect of the publishing process correctly could mean
the difference between generating a profit and losing money on your publish-
ing venture. In the following sections, I explain several factors to consider as
you choose a cover price.
If you’re working with a POD publisher instead of a traditional printer,
chances are that the company either helps you set your cover price or sets it
for you. See Chapter 10 for the scoop on traditional printers and Chapter 11
for more about POD publishers.
Calculating your publication costs
The first step in your calculation of cost should be mathematical estimations
and budgeting. Determine how much money you invested in your publishing
project in order to write and publish your book. A wide range of costs and
fees are involved in every aspect of the publishing process. The costs you
specifically need to know to start figuring your cover price include
 Fixed expenses, such as writing, editing, and designing costs
 Printing costs, based on the print run (the number of copies) you order
(see the next section for details on print runs and Part III for basics on
printing)
 The costs of shipping, warehousing, advertising, marketing, and promot-
ing your books
 Market comparisons — looking at published books already in book-
stores that are similar to yours in size, format, and topic — to make sure
that you aren’t underpricing or overpricing your book for the current
market
106
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

If you plan to sell most of your inventory at personal appearances, you may
be able to price your book higher than the market average. If a substantial
proportion of your books are headed for bookstores, however, it’s important
to be price-competitive. In some cases a self-published author’s costs are
much higher. A book from a major publisher may sell for $14.95; the self-pub-
lished author might have to sell a similar book for $19.95 to make any money.
This pricing depends on how the book is printed or published; however,
using POD often requires a higher cover price, regardless of the competition.
Here are a couple of options to help you work with numbers:
 Use a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, to create a detailed
budget, track expenses, and help you calculate your break-even point as
you begin to determine what the cover price of your book will be.
 Contact a consulting firm that specializes in the publishing industry.
These firms offer spreadsheets designed to help small publishers calcu-
late their costs, establish budgets, and set their book’s cover price.
Gropen Associates, Inc. is one company that can help. For more informa-
tion, visit the company’s Web site at www.gropenassoc.com/Top
LevelPages/DoItYourself.htm.
See Chapter 6 for more about keeping track of costs and creating a budget.
Predicting demand
Accurately anticipating the demand for your book helps you predict sales
and calculate potential revenues. There’s a huge difference between having
anticipated sales of 1,000 copies of your book that targets a very niche audi-
ence and sales of 25,000 copies or more for a general interest book to the
mass market.
 A niche-oriented audience limits sales potential, and you may want to
have a higher cover price for your book sales to ensure profits.
 A mass-market audience requires an expansive marketing, advertising,
and promotional campaign, which costs more money. If you plan to sell 
a lot of books, you can reduce the cover price somewhat to earn higher
profits based on sales volume.
Doing proper market research, knowing the size of your audience, and having
realistic expectations helps you anticipate demand for your book. Begin by
researching the sales success of previously published books with similar
topics and marketing campaigns. You need to market your book directly to
readers and determine the best ways to reach them. Chapter 4 helps you
better understand who your target readers are.
107
Chapter 7: Tackling Book-Specific Tasks

Considering wholesale and 
discounted pricing
Depending on how you plan to sell your book, you may need to calculate
potential profits based on the wholesale or discounted price for which you
plan to sell your book. (Also consider sales commissions and royalties you
may need to pay for certain distribution opportunities.) For example, book-
sellers, distributors, and wholesalers may purchase your book in large quan-
tities but at a discount of 40 to 60 percent off the cover price.
Unless you’re going to sell your book directly to readers, via your Web site 
or when you make appearances or do lectures, plan on selling it at a signifi-
cantly discounted price. See Chapter 15 for details about distributing your
book through traditional channels.
Determining your book’s perceived value
How much are people really willing to pay for your book? Some nonfiction, spe-
cial interest trade paperbacks have a retail price of $39.95 or higher because
the information it contains is perceived to be valuable to the intended reader.
Knowing your audience helps you evaluate how much they may be willing to
purchase your book for at retail.
If you’re providing information, facts, statistics, or other content that can
only be found in your book, readers may perceive that to be extra valuable
and they may pay a slight premium for their perceptions. Note that perceived
value doesn’t really apply to fiction. Why? Readers expect to pay under $10
for a fiction paperback. Even if the novel is a bestseller, readers won’t pay a
premium for it. This is why mass-market paperbacks (novels) typically have a
relatively low cover price compared to nonfiction trade paperbacks.
After performing your own financial calculations and sales projections, take 
a look at competing book titles already in your market to determine what
they’re selling for and what the sales history is for those titles. Use this infor-
mation to determine if your book’s cover price is too high or too low, based
on the competition. If a book is much cheaper than its competition, it can be
perceived as possessing less valuable information. If the book is priced much
higher than the competition, the potential reader may opt to purchase the
less expensive book.
108
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

Putting everything together to 
come up with a magic number
After you know the total cost per book to have it printed, use this important
piece of information to help you create your book’s cover price.
Your cost per book is the total amount of money you need to spend to have
each copy of your book printed. To determine your cost per book, simply
add all your publication costs together and divide it by the number of copies
you plan to have printed. There is no set formula to figure cover price based
on cost per book. This is totally different for everyone, based on how the
book is being printed and published, the distribution method, and target
audience. Do consider, however, how you’re going to be selling the book and
what distribution methods you plan to use. Will you be earning the entire
cover price of the book or just 40, 50, or 60 percent of the cover price?
If you’re selling your book directly to consumers at its cover price, your
profit can be calculated by subtracting the cost per book from the cover
price. For example, if you want your book’s cover price at $19.95 and your
total cost per book is $6, your profit — if you sell your book directly to a cus-
tomer for the cover price — is $13.95 per copy. If you sell your entire print
run of 2,000 books directly to customers (through your own Web site or when
you make appearances), your total profit is $27,900.
However, if you’re selling your book through retailers, booksellers, whole-
salers, or distributors, you’re selling your book for 40 to 60 percent off the
cover price. You also need to calculate any sales commissions you need to
pay.
So, if you want your book’s cover price to be $19.95 and the total cost per
book is $6, but you’re selling the book to a retailer at 40 percent off the cover
price ($11.97), your per copy profit is $5.97. If you sell your entire print run 
of 2,000 books through booksellers and retailers, you earn $11,940.
Choosing the most competitive printer, negotiating your best deal, and accu-
rately anticipating demand so you can determine the most appropriate size
of your print run helps you keep your costs down and increase your book’s
profit potential based on your book’s cover price. Factors like trim size, page
count, paper type, cover stock, and binding all impact your printing costs.
For example, you can cut costs by hiring a traditional printer to publish a
trade paperback book (as opposed to hard cover) with a less expensive
paper stock, a larger trim size, and fewer pages. (However, you don’t want 
109
Chapter 7: Tackling Book-Specific Tasks

to jeopardize the professional look of your book.) It’s important for the
printer you hire to understand what your book is about, its intended audi-
ence, how you plan to distribute it, and your budget, so he can help you
make appropriate printing decisions. See Part III for more about printing
options.
If you’re selling your book directly to consumers or retailers, for example,
you may need to charge sales tax. Every state has different guidelines, so be
sure to consult with your accountant to ensure that you collect the appropri-
ate amount of sales tax on applicable sales. As for shipping charges, this
doesn’t need to be calculated into the cover price of your book. When people
place an order for your book, from your Web site, for example, they expect to
pay extra for shipping and handling.
The Right Time: Selecting Your 
Book’s Publication Date
Part of taking a well-organized and well-thought-out approach to self-publishing
is to determine the best time of year to release your book. Consider the time
it takes to complete each stage of the publishing process (taking into account
lead times and processing times needed by editors, layout people, graphic
designers, proofreaders, printers, distributors, order fulfillment houses, and
so on) and plan your release date accordingly.
Your publication date is the date your book goes to press. Your street date or
release date is the day your book is available to the public.
If your book has seasonal interest or must be released in conjunction with a
certain holiday or date, scheduling becomes that much more critical. Missing
that date could cost you sales. You can find a holiday to tie into any kind of
book with a specialty calendar like Chase’s Calendar of Events. (Do an Internet
search for Chase’s Calendar of Events to get your copy.)
Based on your audience, the topic of your book and your writing, production,
printing, distribution, advertising, public relations, and marketing schedules,
choose a date to release your book that’s achievable and that makes the most
sense in terms of generating the highest possible sales. For example, if you’re
releasing a book about decorating your home for the Christmas holiday, a
good time to release the book would be late Fall (two or three months before
Christmas), not after the holiday season. Meanwhile, January or February is a
great time to release a book about dating or romance, because you can tie in
your promotional efforts with Valentine’s Day. Check out Chapter 1 for a gen-
eral timeline of the self-publishing process to help you decide.

Coming Up with Creative 
Page Design and Layout
In This Chapter
 Beginning with the basics of designing your book
 Using popular desktop publishing software
 Creating a final digital file for the printer
 Finding a graphic designer for expert help
W
hen readers open your book, they expect to see each page profession-
ally designed. In addition to the content being free of spelling and
grammatical mistakes (something a professional editor helps you with; see
Chapter 5), from a visual standpoint, each page should look appealing and
easy to read.
Making your book’s interior look good involves laying out each page in a PDF
or Postscript PRN file before it goes to press. The formatting and design you
apply to your book’s interior directly impacts how your book looks when it’s
ultimately printed. This chapter focuses on your manuscript’s layout and
design, so the book’s interior looks professional and appealing.
Many companies that offer all-inclusive publishing solutions such as Print-
On-Demand (POD) (see Chapter 11) include basic page layout and design ser-
vices. If you’re handling your self-publishing project entirely on your own and
you’re not proficient in using a popular desktop publishing software package,
such as Adobe InDesign CS2 or QuarkXPress (described later in this chapter),
seriously consider hiring a professional graphic designer to handle this
aspect of the book publishing process for you. There’s a big difference
between mere legibility and effective page design, which takes experience to
create. I cover strategies for hiring a graphic designer later in this chapter.

Delving into Do-It-Yourself Page Design
A book’s interior pages must contain the proper information, displayed 
using headline and body text fonts that are easy to read. If your book
includes pieces of artwork, they must be properly formatted and placed on
the appropriate pages. A properly designed book also includes all the ele-
ments common to professionally published titles in the front and back
matter. In the following sections, I guide you through setting your type in
word-processed documents, deciding on a few upfront design considerations,
and creating the body of your book.

Web site at www.helppublish.com/layout.html.
Setting your type in a word processor
Most manuscripts are created using a word processor, such as Microsoft
Word. Unless the person who does your page layout and design tells you dif-
ferently, within your manuscript you can add basic formatting instructions,
telling the layout and design person where headings, subheads, sidebars,
photos, illustrations, and other elements go. (The actual text of your manu-
script doesn’t need any formatting instructions.)
For example, while you’re writing, you can add the line <BEGIN SIDEBAR> and
<END SIDEBAR> into your manuscript to tell the design person where a side-
bar begins and ends. For a level-one heading (the biggest heading you use),
you can use the code [H1] following by the heading. For a subheading smaller
than a level-one heading, you could use the code [H2] or [H3] followed by the
heading text as appropriate.
A level-one heading created in a word processor looks like this example:
[H1] This Is a Sample Level-One Heading
When the layout and designer starts doing his job, the heading would be
transformed to look something like the heading of this section (although you
can choose the font and type size; see “Choosing fonts” later in this chapter).
The more direction that you provide within the manuscript itself, the easier
designing the book’s internal layout to match your vision can be.
Making some upfront design decisions
As you embark on the page design process, focus on your book’s target audi-
ence and on what’s appropriate for the type of book you’re publishing:
112
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

 Font: The font can make your book more visually appealing but can also
set a tone. Using a font that’s too small or difficult to read can make it
much harder for the reader to appreciate and understand the content.
 Too much content: Putting too much content on each page can also
make the overall book more challenging to read.
 Layout and design: Just as creating the content for your book was a cre-
ative and well-thought-out process, so is the layout and design of your
book. The creativity you incorporate into this phase of the publishing
process can determine how well your book sells and whether your read-
ers enjoy looking at the pages as they’re reading.
One of the first steps in developing your book’s interior page design is choos-
ing the trim size (dimensions) of your book. This step determines the dimen-
sions of each page and helps you figure out how much actual content fits on
each page. At this stage, don’t aim for a certain page count for the total book;
wait and see how long the book winds up to be before tweaking anything with
the layout. Chapter 10 delves deeper into choosing trim size.
Next, you need to decide how much color, if any, will be used in the book.
Many books use just black ink and black-and-white photos within the book’s
interior. You can, however, opt to include a second or third color or utilize
full-color printing throughout your entire book, but remember that this deci-
sion increases your production costs dramatically (Chapter 6 covers publish-
ing costs in more detail). The additional colors can be used to highlight
headings or specific contents. The text in your book can be printed in one
color, but the drawings, charts, or illustrations, for example, could be dis-
played in a different color to make them easier to read and stand out more.
Another important part of the design process involves knowing the specific
order for major elements of your book, and then deciding how each element
will look. The front matter and back matter of your book typically requires
more formatting than the main body of your book. The front matter includes
 The book’s title page
 Copyright page
 Acknowledgements and dedication
 Table of contents
 Foreword or preface
 Introduction
The back matter can include
 The appendixes
 Bibliography
113
Chapter 8: Coming Up with Creative Page Design and Layout

 Glossary
 Index
 Author bio
Not all of these elements are necessarily appropriate or required for the type
of book you’re publishing. If you’re using a POD printer or an offset printer
that offers a turnkey publishing solution, the front matter and the back
matter typically are compiled for you.
Building the body of your book
Based on the type of book you’re publishing, your target audience, and your
own sense of style, you need to make decisions about the overall look of your
book’s interior. These decisions should remain consistent from page to page
and determine how your book ultimately looks when it’s printed.
Coming up with the right page design means incorporating a bit of creativity
into the process and focusing on each element of your book’s interior. You
need to select a headline font and a text font and determine font sizes to be
used. You also need to decide on a master page design, so all the interior
pages are consistent in terms of margins, layout, and overall appearance. I
cover these topics in the following sections and provide some handy hints
for creating chapter title pages and incorporating artwork into your book.
Choosing fonts
In the world of graphic design and typesetting, typed characters are measured
in points. There are 72 points in one inch. This measurement means that the
smaller the point size of the font, the smaller it appears on the printed page.
If you make the text too small, your readers may be unable to read your
words. If the text is too large, your book takes on the appearance of a chil-
dren’s book and may look amateurish.
For the main body text within your book, the size of the font should be
between 10 and 12 points, unless your book is targeted to children or adults
who are visually impaired (in which case a larger point size type could be
used, such as 14- or 15-point type.) Chapter titles and headings should be
larger than your body text and be displayed in a bold font. The font’s point
size depends on the overall look you’re going for with your design decisions.
Figure 8-1 showcases how Garamond (a common text font) looks in several
different point sizes: 9 points, 10 points, 11 points, 12 points, and 13 points.
Also displayed in Figure 8-1 are several different sizes of the Georgia font, one
of many fonts that can be used for headings.
114
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

This is a sample of Garamond displayed in a 9-point size. As you can see, it’s a bit 
difficult to read.
This is a sample of Garamond displayed in a 10-point size. For certain types of 
books, when you’re trying to make a lot of words fit on a page, this point size 
is appropriate.
This is a sample of Garamond displayed in an 11-point size. This point 
size is much easier to read and more pleasing to the human eye.
This is a sample of Garamond displayed in a 12-point size. Most 
people will have no trouble reading this size type. It’s suitable for 
the body text of almost any type of book.
This is the Georgia font displayed in 
17-point type. It’s ideal for level-one 
headings.
This is the Georgia font displayed in a 
bold, 17-point type. It’s also ideal for 
level-one headings.
This is the Georgia font displayed in 
a bold and italicized 17-point type. 
It’s another way of displaying this 
font when using it for a level-one 
heading.
This is the Georgia font displayed in a bold, 
15-point type. It’s ideal for level-two 
headings.
This is the Georgia font displayed in a bold and italicized 
10-point type. It’s ideal for level-three headings.
Figure 8-1:

115
Chapter 8: Coming Up with Creative Page Design and Layout

Decreasing the point size of your font, even by a small amount, decreases
your book’s page count dramatically (resulting in lower production costs)
because more text fits on each page. But remember that a standard 10- to 12-
point font is much easier on the eyes to read than a smaller 9-point font.
The font you choose for your book’s main text should be easy-to-read and
needs to be based on the look you’re trying to achieve for your book and its
intended audience. In the United States, serif-based fonts tend to be popular.
 A serif font uses short, lines, curves, or embellishments, called serifs,
that project from the top or bottom of a letter’s mainstroke. This style of
font helps guide the reader’s eyes in a straight line across the page.
 Sans serif fonts use less curves and embellishments. They’re great for
headings, but are a bit harder on the eye when used as a main text font.
See Figure 8-2 for a sampling of common text fonts. Visit the Adobe Type
Library online (www.studio.adobe.com/us/type/main.jsp) to see a
sampling of over 2,200 fonts — many of which are suitable for use in books.
Keep the following points in mind when you select fonts:
 Make sure the font is available in a variety of typefaces, including
normal, bold, and italics. (Refer to Figure 8-2 for examples of fonts in all
three styles.) This variety gives you the most flexibility when laying out
your body text.
 Make sure the fonts you choose are compatible with the printing tech-
nology you use to print your book. Some POD publishers don’t accept
books that use Times New Roman or Arial fonts, due to incompatibility
issues with the printing equipment.
Focusing on formatting
Formatting refers to how the text is formatted on the page — the page mar-
gins, page numbers, and running heads. A cluttered page is harder to read
and potentially confusing. Learning to use white space effectively on each
page helps make your book more visually appealing.
Follow these steps for formatting your text:
1. Set the margins for each page.
All your margins must be consistent. The margins used are determined
in part by the book’s trim size, how long the manuscript is, and your
desired page count. Your printing company or professional designer can
help you choose appropriate margins, because there are no hard rules.
116
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

2. Choose whether your book has a running head.
Your book’s running head can consist of the book’s title, chapter title, or
the author’s name appearing across the top of each page. If you study
other books, you may see that some display the book’s title on the left
pages and the chapter title on the right pages. What’s included within
the running head is entirely up to you.
This is an example of Garamond, one of many popular body text fonts. 
It’s displayed here using a normal 12-point font size. This is what it 
looks like displayed in bold. This is the same Garamond 
12-point font displayed in italics.
This is an example of Times New Roman, one of many popular body 
text fonts. It’s displayed here using a normal 12-point font size. This 
is what it looks like displayed in bold. This is the same Times New 
Roman 12-point font displayed in italics.
This is an example of Baskerville, one of many popular body 
text fonts. It’s displayed here using a normal 12-point font size. 
This is what it looks like displayed in bold. This is the same 
Baskerville 12-point font displayed in italics.
This is an example of Goudy, one of many popular body text fonts. 
It’s displayed here using a normal 12-point font size. This is what it 
looks like displayed in bold. This is the same Goudy 12-point font 
displayed in italics.
This is an example of Bookman Old Style, one of many 
popular body text fonts. It’s displayed here using a 
normal 12-point font size. This is what it looks like 
displayed in bold. This is the same Bookman Old Style 
12-point font displayed in italics.

3. Decide where you want the page numbers to appear.
You have a number of choices: At the top of the page in the center,
upper-right corner, or upper-left corner; at the bottom of the page in the
center, lower-right corner, or lower-left corner.
See Figure 8-3 for a sample of what a basic page layout may look like for your
self-published book. This page from my book The Bachelor’s Guide To Life,
(designed and published using POD technology) features standard body text,
one level-one heading, and the running head at the top of the page.

118
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

To help you develop design ideas, examine a handful of books that target a
similar audience. Scrutinize the different design elements that have been
incorporated. Pick and choose elements you like from those books, but be
sure to add your own personal creativity when finalizing your book’s design.
Crafting chapter title pages
Chapter title pages can be used on the first page of each new chapter. The
title page displays the chapter number for a fiction or nonfiction book, but
for nonfiction, you should also include the chapter title and perhaps some
type of graphic and/or a short paragraph about what that chapter is about.
Depending on your creativity, you can jazz up your chapter title pages in sev-
eral different ways:
 By using a different and larger font than your body text
 Altering the font and/or size of the first words or letters at the beginning
of the first paragraph of each chapter
 Creating a special graphic that goes on each chapter title page
When creating chapter title pages, you’re free to use your own creativity;
however, all the chapter title pages in your book should be similar in their
formatting to maintain continuity throughout the book.
Some publishers insist that all chapter title pages be on the right side and
include a blank left-side page prior to it. This is a tradition that not all pub-
lishers adhere to, so ultimately it’s your decision. Generally, running heads
and page numbers don’t appear on chapter title pages.
Figure 8-4 features a chapter title page from The Bachelor’s Guide To Life.
Notice that it’s a right-handed page. While the page number is displayed in
the bottom center, there’s no running header on this page.
Incorporating artwork
Depending on the type of book you’re publishing, artwork — in the form of
photographs, graphs, charts, tables, figures, illustrations or clip art (see
Chapter 4 for more about these formats) — adds visual appeal, impacts your
book, and helps you better communicate information.
To enhance the impact of your artwork, make sure that each graphic element
is sized and formatted properly and placed on the appropriate page in your
book:
 Sizing: The size of images, charts, illustrations, and other graphics of
your book should be easy to read. Depending on the trim size of your
book, you may want to allocate at least a half-page per photograph,
chart, or graphic. Some charts or graphs, however, may warrant a full
page if they contain a lot of detailed information.
119
Chapter 8: Coming Up with Creative Page Design and Layout

 Formatting: When it comes to incorporating any type of artwork into
your book, that artwork must first be translated into a digital format (if
it’s not in a digital format already), and then imported into the desktop
publishing software used to lay out your book’s interior pages (see
“Surveying software packages” later in this chapter). It may be neces-
sary to scan photographs or other images and/or use specialized soft-
ware to edit or fine-tune the digital images to meet the resolution
requirements and technical specifications provided by your printer.
Figure 8-4:

120
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

Don’t use low-resolution artwork into your book. If the photographs and
artwork aren’t created or scanned in high resolution, the printed version
(versus the on-screen version) appears blurry or pixilated — the picture
appears as a bunch of dots instead of one smooth image. This error can
dramatically detract from the professional appearance of your book.
Ideally, reproduced photos at 300 pixels-per-inch (ppi) resolution.
Contact your printer for details about specific printing requirements.
 Placement: The artwork should be placed in the appropriate location,
after its reference in the text. You can reference figure numbers within the
text and display the corresponding figure numbers with the artwork to
help readers understand where to look for the image that corresponds to
the text they’re reading (for example, in Chapter 1, the first figure would
be labeled Figure 1-1. The second figure would be Figure 1-2 and so on).
Also, don’t cluster too much artwork together, because that can detract
from the text and look messy.
To help you edit artwork and prepare each image for inclusion within your
book, you can use many graphics programs:
 Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.com/
products/photoshop)
 Corel Paint Shop Pro (www.corel.com/paintshop)
 LView Pro (www.lview.com)
 Microsoft Digital Image (www.microsoft.com/products/imaging)
These and other graphic editing software packages can be purchased online
or from any software retailer.
Laying Out Your Book with Popular
Desktop Publishing Software
If you handle your book’s page layout and design yourself, you need to select
a desktop publishing software package. In the following sections, I discuss
the most popular package and give you a quick rundown on laying out your
book with templates.
Surveying software packages
After your manuscript is created using Microsoft Word (or another popular
word processor; see “Setting your type in a word processor” earlier in this
chapter), import your text into a desktop publishing software package to be
laid out. This step is called creating the galleys — exactly what the pages look
like after they’re printed in book form.
121
Chapter 8: Coming Up with Creative Page Design and Layout

I suggest designing and laying out the pages of your book with some 
powerful desktop publishing software. Now, you have some choices when it
comes to these programs, which I cover in the following sections, but you
can use Microsoft Publisher, Adobe InDesign CS2 (formally PageMaker), or
QuarkXPress (three of the most widely used programs). Be sure to check out
the specific For Dummies books on these programs for more details on how
to use them successfully.
Not sure which desktop publishing software to use? Check out the following
software publishing company’s Web sites for information (some companies
even have free 30-day trial version of its desktop publishing programs):
 Microsoft Publisher (www.microsoft.com/office/publisher/
prodinfo/default.mspx)
 Adobe InDesign CS2 (www.adobe.com/products/tryadobe/main.
jsp#product=31)
 QuarkXPress (www.quark.com)
Microsoft Publisher 2003
Microsoft Publisher 2003 is desktop publishing software that’s part of the
Microsoft Office family of products. Priced at around $200, this software can
be used for designing and laying out the interior of virtually any type of book.
The advantage to using this software is that it’s very similar to all the other
applications in the Microsoft Office suite of products. So, if you’re already
familiar with Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, the learning curve for mastering
Publisher may be much shorter for you. But don’t worry if it isn’t. Publisher
is still the easiest of the three programs that I recommend.
Publishers’ functions are simpler and user friendly. Check out these tasks you
can perform with Microsoft Publisher:
 Cut and paste text or graphics from one Office application to another.
 Download (from www.microsoft.com) free, professional-looking, pre-
created layout and design templates.
 Use the Design Checker feature to ensure that each section of your book
has consistent design elements.
Out of the three desktop publishing applications described in this chapter,
Publisher is definitely the easiest to use, but it’s not the most powerful, based
on the functionality it offers.
122
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

Adobe InDesign CS2
InDesign CS2, Adobe’s comprehensive desktop publishing solution, features all
the tools and functionality you need to expertly design your book’s interior
layout and design. (This program replaces the company’s popular PageMaker
application and is priced at $699.) It’s also compatible with a wide range of
graphic development and editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop CS2
(used for editing photographs and other graphics).
InDesign CS2 was created for professional graphic designers and relies on the
user’s working knowledge of graphic design to use it properly. If you’re an
inexperienced user, you can expect a steep learning curve, so you may want
to use a pre-created template with the software to save you time (see
“Utilizing templates for maximum layout ease,” later in this chapter).
QuarkXPress
Ever since page layout and design went digital, QuarkXPress (priced at $749)
has been on the cutting-edge when it comes to this aspect of publishing. This
software is the leading choice for book and magazine publishers, as well as
corporate America, to handle a wide range of desktop publishing needs.
QuarkXPress was created for use by professional graphic designers and
offers a large assortment of tools and features for creating extremely complex
page designs. The software is a comprehensive tool designed to handle all
aspects of page layout and design. You begin by loading your basic text into
this software, and then if used correctly, what you wind up with is a fully
designed book ready to go to press.
The only con to this program is that it’s difficult to figure out how to use,
especially if you don’t have a publishing background.
Using templates for maximum layout ease
Templates reduce the number of design-oriented decisions you need to make.
They also help minimize design errors and ensure that your book’s appear-
ance is professional. Using a template can also save you a lot of time and
effort. Check out these steps:
1. Choose a professionally created design template that resembles how
you want your book to look.
2. Cut and paste or import your text and artwork into the template.
3. Customize the template to better meet your own design needs.
123
Chapter 8: Coming Up with Creative Page Design and Layout

4. Save each chapter of the book as a separate laid-out file because it’s
easier to manage smaller files (with each chapter kept separate until
they’re merged once the layout and design is complete).
You can find plenty of resources to help you with templates:
 www.ideabook.com: The InDesign Ideabook, The QuarkXPress Ideabook,
and The PageMaker Ideabook are three books priced at $59.95 each and
that include a CD-ROM filled with dozens of pre-created templates for
creating books and a wide range of other publications. You can also
order any of these books by calling (804) 266-7996.
 www.stocklayouts.com: StockLayouts (www.stocklayouts.com) is
another source of downloadable templates.
 Publisher’s Web site: Be sure to visit the Web site operated by the pub-
lisher of the desktop publishing software you’re using to find additional
templates available for downloading.
 A professional designer: If you’re dead set against using templates, hire
a designer.
 Create your own: Create your own template using the design software.
All templates can be fully customized, and they can make your book
look totally unique, so nobody has to know that a template was used.
Converting Laid-Out Pages 
into Printer-Friendly Files
After the interior of your book is designed and laid out by using a desktop
publishing software application (see the previous section), the next step is to
convert that file into a file that your printer can read.
Portable Document Format (PDF) files
You can use Adobe Acrobat or a compatible program to create a PDF. The
PDF file is the one that’s handed over to the printer along with your cover
design; see Chapter 9 for details on covers. The offset printer or POD publish-
ing company you use provides the technical specifications the PDF must
adhere to; see Chapters 10 and 11 for more about these printers.
124
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

The Adobe Acrobat 7.0 software ($299 or $449, depending on the standard or
professional version) takes virtually any type of file, such as a document cre-
ated using Microsoft Publisher, InDesign CS2, or QuarkXPress, and translates
it into a digital PDF file. Find out more about this software at www.adobe.
com/products/acrobat/main.html. You can also check out various For
Dummies books on Adobe Acrobat, depending on the version you have.
After your book is in a PDF format, it basically contains the ready-to-publish
galleys for your book. Each page appears exactly how it will look when
printed. The entire book has to be in a PDF format to send to your printer.
Some programs, such as InDesign CS2, have the ability to create PDF files
without using the Adobe Acrobat 7.0 software. If you’re hiring a professional
graphic designer to handle the layout and design of your book (see the next
section) or using a POD publisher, chances are, they handle this phase of the
publishing process for you.
PostScript PRN files
A PostScript PRN file is similar to a PDF file and is compatible with printing
equipment used by book printers and publishers. Most desktop publishing
software packages have the ability to export a file into the PostScript PRN
format. Depending on the printer you hire, you need to supply your file when
your book goes to press. Your printer provides specific guidelines on how to
create this file to meet their needs.
Hiring a Professional Graphic Designer
If you’re not comfortable with handling the design and layout of your book
(and/or the cover design, which I explain in Chapter 9), consider hiring a pro-
fessional graphic designer to help you out. This person has experience work-
ing with visuals and knows how to choose fonts, typestyles, color schedules,
and graphic images and makes them all work together to help communicate
your message in a visually appealing way.
Graphic designers are typically born with natural artistic ability, which they
then supplement with several years of training by completing college-level
courses. These people also know how to work with complicated software-
based graphic design tools, such as InDesign and QuarkXPress, used in the
publishing industry. Designers have experience creating images that are com-
patible with what your book printer needs to publish the most professional-
looking book possible.
125
Chapter 8: Coming Up with Creative Page Design and Layout

In the following sections, I give you guidance on finding a graphic designer
and providing your designer with proper information on the layout you envi-
sion. For specific information on working with a graphic designer to create
your book’s cover, head to Chapter 9.
Finding the right expert
Hiring the right expert to help you layout and design your book is critical if
you want your book to look professional and truly appeal to readers. Even if
the content of your book is perfect, if the book doesn’t look professional, you
can lose credibility. Hiring the right designer means finding someone with
experience in layout and design work for books (preferably the type of book
you’ve written). Look for someone with top-notch design skills and creative,
artistic abilities and an impressive portfolio of work.
Knowing where and when to find a designer
Finding a professional graphic designer can be easy. Ideally, you should find
someone who comes highly recommended by someone you know. However,
you can also find freelance graphic designers on the Internet:
 www.elance.com
 www.guru.com/category.cfm/207
 www.Project4Hire.com
 freelanceworkexchange.com
 hotgigs.com
Also check out advertisements on Web sites operated by professional associ-
ations targeted to writers and small publishers. Or you can do a Yahoo! or
Google search, using the phrase graphic designer.
The process of finding a graphic designer to work with should start early in
the self-publishing process. The process takes time from tracking down suit-
able candidates, evaluating their portfolios, communicating your needs,
negotiating a price to being able to give the designer ample time to work on
your book.
Plan on hiring a designer as early in the self-publishing process as possible —
like as soon as you’re finished writing and editing your manuscript. (Begin
the design for your front and back cover as soon as you decide to write the
book.) Here are some important considerations:
126
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

 Ask your designer about the time frame he’s capable of working within
to ensure it fits with your publishing schedule.
 Depending on the work load of the designer, laying out and designing
your book properly can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks.
 Leave ample time to make corrections to the design after it’s complete.
Evaluating designers’ work
After you have a creative vision regarding how you want your book to look,
interview a handful of graphic designers and review their portfolios of work.
Find someone whose work resembles your vision or who’s capable of taking
your vision and transforming it into a professional-looking book.
As you interview designers and evaluate their portfolios, ask the following
questions:
 How and where were you trained?
 How much experience have you had with book layout and design and/or
creating book covers?
 Do you understand what my book is about and who it targets?
 Do you have experience doing book layout and/or creating book covers
for my intended target audience?
 Do you know how to use popular software tools, to create laid-out pages
and/or cover images that are compatible with the technical require-
ments of your printer?
 How willing are you to make multiple versions of the page design and/or
cover and then make changes as I fine-tune the design?
 What are your rates and how do you bill?
 Can you complete the book’s layout and/or front and back cover within
the time frame I need?
 Can I see your portfolio of sample work?
Graphic designers are only as good as the work they create. Having an
impressive educational background is useful, but having natural artistic 
ability and the skills to create high-impact designs are more important.
Examine the designer’s portfolio of work and use that as your main criteria
when making a hiring decision.
127
Chapter 8: Coming Up with Creative Page Design and Layout

Setting a fair price
The cost of hiring a graphic designer can be anywhere from $500 to several
thousand dollars, depending on the designer’s experience and how much
time he or she invests in creating your book’s layout and/or cover. This step
is where your negotiating skills come into play. First, find a graphic designer
whose work you really like and who you believe can do the job, and then
negotiate a price. You often have much better luck negotiating a lower price
with an individual designer or freelancer as opposed to someone who works
for a graphic design firm that sets their prices for the company. You can often
save money by negotiating a flat-rate for the project instead of an hourly rate.
Deciding how many graphic designers you need
Many graphic designers are capable of doing interior page layout and design
as well as cover design. However, some designers specialize only in one area.
If you’re hiring designers with specific areas of expertise or you’re under a
very tight deadline, consider hiring a separate designer to handle each part
of the book. Discuss your requirements with the initial designer you’re inter-
ested in hiring and determine if she’s capable and comfortable handling
everything.
In some cases, if you use a turnkey POD solution, the publisher provides both
interior design and cover design services (included in the price the author
pays). In this situation, I recommend allowing the publisher to handle the
internal design but still hiring a graphic designer (at an additional expense)
for the cover. Having two people work on these elements of your book
ensures that the cover looks its absolute best.
Supplying your layout preferences
Most graphic designers aren’t going to sit down and read your book in its
entirety. So, it’s your job to properly educate the designer you hire about
your book and its intended audience. Be prepared to supply the following
info:
 Details on what you want the interior of your book to look like
 Guidance about fonts and typestyles you want used
 Details about how you want artwork, graphics, and other visual ele-
ments to be incorporated
 Your preferences about the content in the front and back matter
128
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

 Your preference in regard to the use of running heads
 Any other creative input you have in regard to page layout and design
Layout design is a highly creative process that involves plenty of tweaking
and fine-tuning as you go. As the graphic designer begins to provide you with
drafts of the layout, be open and honest with your thoughts and criticisms.
Communicating your desires ensures that you wind up with a layout that you
really like. Expect to go back and forth multiple times before you wind up
with a final design. Remember — you’re paying for this aspect of your book’s
creation too! Make sure that you leave ample time in your publishing sched-
ule to give the designer time to go back and revise the book based on your
comments and new ideas.

Judging a Book by Its Cover
In This Chapter
 Writing a snappy book title
 Discovering the elements of a good-looking front cover
 Putting together a stellar back cover
 Getting the skinny on your book’s spine
 Hiring a professional to design your cover
You know that saying, “You can’t judge a book by its cover”? Well, forget
you’ve ever heard it! The truth is, intended readers of your book are
your jury, and these people will judge your book by its cover and often make
their buying decision based on how well it captures their attention. So, for a
verdict in your favor — in this case, a sale — create the best front and back
cover, plus brainstorm the best title and subtitle (if applicable) possible.
This chapter focuses on the importance of having an awesome title and sub-
title, and I delve into how to create an attention-getting front cover and a
back cover that does everything possible to help you sell books. You also
discover that even the book’s spine can be used as a powerful sales tool,
especially when it comes to bookstore sales.
Having a Grade-A cover probably means you have to hire a freelance graphic
designer with book cover creation experience. The additional investment in
hiring a graphic designer is worth it because having an incredible cover that
stands out translates into more sales and enhanced credibility. I discuss
working with a professional graphic designer to craft an impressive book
cover later in this chapter; Chapter 8 also has general information on hiring
the best graphic designer for your needs.

Constructing a Catchy Title
What makes a catchy title? Some authors and publishers believe it’s a clever
play on words or something memorable. Others believe it’s a short combina-
tion of words that communicates exactly what the book is about. The truth is
there’s only one rule when it comes to creating a title for your book: Capture
the reader’s attention.
For works of fiction, creativity is more important than communicating a clear
message. However, for nonfiction, the title and subtitle should quickly edu-
cate the reader about the topic of the book and who it appeals to. Think of
your book’s title as the main headline of a breaking news story. If the person
wants to discover more, instead of tuning in for the newscast at 11:00 p.m.,
he can flip the book over and read the back cover. Then, when he’s ready to
delve into the topic, he can purchase the book and read it in its entirety.
Generally, fictional books, such as novels, don’t have subtitles. However, if
your book is nonfiction, creating a catchy and informative subtitle definitely
helps you sell books. There’s plenty of room for creativity when deciding on
your book’s main title, but your subtitle (for works of nonfiction) should
explain exactly what the book is about or offer a really compelling reason
why someone should read it. In the following sections, I show you how to
create a title that’s clear, concise, and memorable.
Keeping your title short and clear
Long book titles are confusing. They don’t usually look good on a book’s
cover, and they seldom help actual sales of the book. You want to make 
your main title short and sweet. The shorter, the better. The subtitle (if 
you choose to use one) can be a short explanatory sentence or phrase.
Ideally, you want your main title to be under five or six words. Keeping the
number of words to a minimum allows the title to be displayed using a large
font. The main title of your book should be displayed large enough on the
book’s front cover so it can be seen and easily read from up to six feet away.
(See “Selecting the right font and placement for the title,” later in this chapter
for more about displaying your book’s title effectively.)
As you develop your title, think about your intended audience (see Chapter 4
for more on targeting certain readers) and create a title that appeals to those
people. Consider the following list when creating your title:
 Who does the book target and what does it take to get attention?
 Why would someone want to read your book?
 What does the book offer?
132
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

 What’s unique about the book?
 What will someone discover from reading it?
 What problems can the book help solve?
The title of your book is a sales tool. When people hear or read the title, their
attention should immediately be captured, and they should want to find out
more about your book. By using a play on words in your title, this attention-
getting device may often boost sales (make sure that your nonfiction book
has a subtitle that clarifies what the book is about, though).
For fiction books, create a title that captures the reader’s attention or that
somehow relates to the storyline. For nonfiction books, the title should offer
a clear benefit or solution, worded in a straightforward way that requires no
interpretation or assumptions by the potential reader. Need inspiration? Take
a trip to your local bookstore and check out the book titles for books that
relate to yours in terms of audience or subject matter. Also, review the best-
sellers lists. Of course, you don’t want to copy a book title from another
book, but you can get a good idea of what types of titles work well.
Making your title stand out
Your book may be competing at least with a few others for a reader’s atten-
tion (that is unless your book covers a topic that’s so targeted to a small
niche market that it has absolutely no competition, which is very rare. Your
book’s title is its first line of defense against someone turning to the competi-
tion instead of reading your book.
Therefore, your title should stand out from the competition and make the
potential reader immediately think, “Hey, I need to read that!” or “That book
could really help me.” Creativity is what sets your book apart from the thou-
sands of others on the bookstore shelves or the potentially dozens of others
that focus on the same topic. After you capture someone’s attention with
your title, the book’s back cover copy and design should sell the potential
reader on actually buying the book (see “Turning to Your Book’s Back Cover,”
later in this chapter for details).
Here are a few tips to help you come up with an attention-grabbing title:
 Create a title for your book after you’ve completed some or all of the
manuscript. As you delve deeper into your own manuscript, you have a
better understanding of what it’s about, the actual content it contains,
and what readers may be interested in. Use this information to help you
narrow down a good title. It’s much easier to create a title based on a fin-
ished book than it is to create a manuscript around a pre-created title.
133
Chapter 9: Judging a Book by Its Cover

 Ask others for help. Write out a list of titles, and then slowly narrow
down the list based on feedback you receive from others.
 Incorporate action verbs and avoid clichés. Many powerful words and
specific phrases help sell.
• Choosing action verbs can add intensity or impact to the title and
help the reader relate better to the subject matter. They can also
be used to draw the reader in and demonstrate what the book is
about.
• Using a cliché in your title takes away from its originality and
detracts from the potential reader’s perception of the overall con-
tent of your book. After all, if the title is unoriginal and uninspired,
what does that say about the content of the entire book?
 Purchase help aids. The book Words That Sell, Revised and Fully Updated
Edition (McGraw-Hill) by Richard Bayan is a thesaurus to help you pro-
mote your products, services, and ideas. This book can help you choose
powerful and attention getting words and phrases to work into your
book’s title and subtitle as well as the back cover copy and promotional
materials for your book.
 Examine other book titles. Visit any bookstore or check out the New
York Times bestsellers list and carefully look at those book titles. Ask
yourself what makes those titles work? Why did the authors and pub-
lishers choose them?
Keeping a Close Eye on the Front Cover
A lot goes into a book’s cover and into creating a positive first impression on
the prospective reader. Whether consciously or subconsciously, the reader
focuses on the following when he or she first sees your book’s cover:
 The wording of the title and subtitle (if applicable), its placement, size,
color and overall appearance
 The author’s name and credentials
 The cover’s color scheme and image
 The cover’s overall design
 The paper stock used for the book’s cover
If you want to really bring your book’s front cover together, you need a 
great title and subtitle (see the previous section) along with a superb cover
designed by a skilled graphic designer (see “Working with a Design Expert to
Create Your Cover,” later in this chapter). Unless you’re planning to use one
134
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

or more photographs acquired from a stock photo agency, line up a profes-
sional photographer and/or illustrator to create your cover’s main image(s).
In the following sections, I give you tips on highlighting the book’s title and
the author’s name; show you how to select a cover image and a color
scheme; and explain how to pull an attractive cover design together.
Showcasing the front cover’s text
Your book’s cover should be used to attract the reader’s attention by incor-
porating an eye-catching visual design, plus text that the potential reader
quickly relates to and is inspired by. The actual text used on your front cover
(the title, subtitle, and so on), is important. But equally important is how that
text is displayed. The font, color scheme, size of the text, and its placement
are all important cover design considerations.
Selecting the right font and placement for the title
Just as important as the actual title on the front cover is the font you use to
create visual appeal. Here are a few considerations when thinking about font:
 Font selection: The font you choose can convey emotion, give meaning
to the title, and add visual appeal to your book’s cover design. To dis-
play your title, choose a font that’s eye-catching, yet appropriate.
 Font style: After you select the actual font, decide if you need to
enhance it by using bold, italic, or underlined text. Using bold or italics
for one word in the title or the entire title can help draw the reader’s
attention. For example, if your book’s title is Stop Smoking Now! 20
Proven Ways To Quit, you could use bold font to highlight the words
Stop Smoking if doing so enhanced the appeal of your cover design.
 Font size: The size of the font determines how much space it takes up on
the cover. In most cases, the title of your book should be displayed in a
large size font and take up considerable space on the front cover.
However, if you’re also incorporating a relevant graphic on your cover,
you need to adjust the font size so ensure that all the cover’s elements
fit nicely and don’t look cluttered.
 Font color: Choosing the right color scheme goes a long way toward
making your cover visually pleasing. Using a bright colored font, how-
ever, can make your title stand out. Make sure that the font color you
choose works to enhance the overall design and appeal of your cover
and doesn’t clash with the other visual elements you’ve incorporated.
All the above elements should be displayed in a visually appealing color
scheme. If you’re using a graphic on your book’s cover, chances are that
image communicates a message, has meaning, or is relevant to your book’s
content. The font you choose to display your book’s title and subtitle should
135
Chapter 9: Judging a Book by Its Cover

complement that image, not compete with it. For example, a modern-looking
photo should be paired with a modern-looking title font. The artwork shouldn’t
overpower your title, so the title gets lost in the cover design. Remember,
your cover should be a powerful selling tool for your book. It’s not an art pro-
ject where abstract design is appreciated or rewarded.
Choosing the right font can add emotion and power to the title, just as music
and sound effects add mood and ambiance to a scary movie. Based on the
topic of your book, the title, and the intended audience, choose a font that
grabs attention and makes a statement. There are literally thousands of fonts
you can choose from. The font can then be customized by adjusting its look
by displaying it in bold or italics, or changing the color, for example.
In Figure 9-1, author Jamise L. Dames originally designed this cover for her
bestselling novel (well, it wasn’t bestselling at the time). The graphic of a
pregnant mother and father is powerful and directly relates to the storyline
of the novel. The title itself is positioned prominently and complements the
image from a visual standpoint. The wording of the title also forces the reader
to consider its meaning. (The cover was later redesigned for bookstore distri-
bution after selling over 25,000 copies as a self-published title.)

Here are a few Web sites that you can check out to help you select a font:
 www.1001fonts.com: To see a selection of fonts available for use on
your book’s cover, check out 1001Fonts.com’s Web site.
 www.studio.adobe.com/us/type/main.jsp: The Adobe Type Library
offers over 2,200 different fonts and typestyles, which can be previewed
and purchased online. You can enter a short phrase, such as your book’s
title, and see how it looks displayed in hundreds of different fonts.
 www.groan-zone.net/delphi/font.html: FontView is free software
that allows you to type your book’s title and see how it looks when it’s
published. The text displays in different fonts, styles, sizes, and colors.
 www.styopkin.com: Styopkin Software offers Advanced Font Viewer as
a downloadable software application that serves the same purpose as
FontView (see previous bullet).
Highlighting the author’s name and credentials
Typically, the book’s main title should be the most prominent thing displayed
on the front cover. But, of course, there are exceptions to every rule. If you’re
well known and people are buying the book because you’ve written it, you
want to showcase your name and even your photo, along with the book’s title,
because these tactics may help you sell books. For example, on the covers of
many bestselling books, you often see the author’s name displayed in a larger
type than the title, because it’s the author’s name and reputation that sells the
book. On the hardcover edition of Stephen King’s novel The Cell, King’s name
is displayed much larger than the title is.
In addition, if you’re an expert in your field or a well-known person, promote it
on the front cover. For example, you can say, “From the bestselling author of
[insert title] . . .” or “From the President or CEO of [insert company name] . . .”
Depending on the author’s credentials truly and how helpful those credentials
are in selling books determine how large they’re displayed on the book’s cover.
Typically, the author’s credentials should be easily visible, but displayed in a
smaller font size than the name on the book’s front cover. This, however, is a
creative decision and not a design rule that must be followed.
Using attractive images
The correct cover graphic has a huge impact on the appeal of your cover. So
whether you choose one or more photographs, pieces of clip art or illustra-
tions, or any combination of these graphic elements combined with a title
that’s displayed in an appropriate and eye-catching font, think about how
readers may view your book.
137
Chapter 9: Judging a Book by Its Cover

There are no rules for choosing an image to display on your book’s cover, but
you should follow these guidelines:
 The image should be relevant to the book’s topic.
 Your graphic should make a statement.
 The picture should help convey information about the book’s content.
 The images should be visually appealing and attention getting.
 All graphics shouldn’t distract the reader from the book’s main title.
Whether you use a photograph, illustration, or some other type of graphic on
your book’s cover is entirely your creative decision. Your goal is to create a
book that looks highly professional, though, and one or more photographs
often convey a more professional look that other types of graphics.
The size and placement of the image(s) you use is also a creative decision.
You want the image to be visible, but not contrast with or overpower the title.
In Figure 9-2, you can see how the cover images used to promote a fictional
novel can be used to attract the reader’s attention. For his self-published 
psychological suspense novel Angel Falls, author Oliver Dick uses a strong
graphic image to capture the reader’s imagination. In full color, you’d see
deep reds, blacks, and yellows with the title displayed in white.
When it comes to acquiring artwork for your book’s cover, you can take your
own photograph(s), find relevant clip art, or incorporate an appropriate illus-
tration. Depending on your budget, you can also have these graphic elements
custom-created specifically for your book by hiring a professional photogra-
pher, artist, or illustrator in addition to a graphic designer (see “Working with
a Design Expert to Create Your Cover,” later in this chapter). You can also uti-
lize stock clip art or photos that you license from an agency. Chapter 4 offers
additional information on acquiring art for your book.
Choosing colors carefully
Although a cover printed using a four-color printing process is ideal, you can
get away with a one- or two-color cover if your use of color and design is cre-
ative. Certain colors attract attention and create a certain mood or convey an
emotion. Consider reading some introductory books about graphic design to
discover how colors can be used to create a mood or emotion and what color
combinations may appeal most to your readers.
138

Pulling together the overall design
A cover’s overall design refers to how all the cover’s elements are put
together to give it visual impact. This design includes the appearance of the
title and subtitle; the appearance of the author’s name (and credentials, if
used); and the use of photographs, clip art, or illustrations. It also includes
the use of a distinct color scheme.
The cover’s design conveys a message. It can attract positive attention
(which is what it’s supposed to do), blend in (so the potential reader passes
by your book and picks up a completing title), or get attention for a negative
reason. You don’t want someone noticing your cover and thinking to them-
selves, “Gee, that’s ugly!,” “What was that author thinking?,” or “I have no
clue what this book is about.”
The front cover graphics should complement the title and be used to commu-
nicate information. Figure 9-3 is the cover of my self-published book The

Bachelor’s Guide To Life: Answers To Common and Not-So-Common Questions
Every Single Guy Often Asks. Every element of the cover, from the title and
subtitle to the photographs and color scheme, helps explain what the book is
about and who should read it:
 The title: The title of this book is pretty straightforward. From the main
title, you immediately know who the book is targeted to and you get a
pretty good idea of what it’s about. The title is displayed in a large and
easy-to-read font.
 Subtitle: The subtitle explains that the book is chock-full of answers that
the intended audience needs.
 Author’s name: Place the author’s name in a readable font (not so small
you need a magnifying glass to read it) in the lower-left corner.
 Images: The four photographs used on the cover also communicate the
type of information within the book.
• Clearly visible in the upper-left corner of the front cover is a young
man shaving (a topic covered in the book).
• Moving to the right, another young man is participating in sports
(a popular pastime among single men).
• Toward the bottom of the cover, potential readers see a guy on a
romantic walk with his girlfriend because dating is another huge
aspect of a single guy’s life.
• The last photo is of a man in a business suit, showcasing the pro-
fessional/career aspect of his life.
 Colors: The cover design for The Bachelor’s Guide To Life also utilizes a
bright and cheerful, red, white, and blue color scheme. This subtly con-
veys a sense of patriotism and communicates the message that this
book is for “All-American” guys.
Because you’re so close to your own work, before choosing a final title and
cover design, get some input about the design. Think of it as forming your
own little focus group. Form the group from 10 to 20 people you don’t know.
Try getting feedback from total strangers or salespeople and managers at
bookstores, as well as librarians. These participants need to fit your book’s
target audience. Ask them what they think about the book’s title and cover
design. After showing the book’s title and cover design, ask your focus group
specifically what they think the book is about and who they think it targets.
Their answers should be correct and intuitive. If you get responses like “I
don’t get it” or “What’s this book about, anyway?” go back to the drawing
board. If the intended audience for your book doesn’t understand what
you’re trying to say with your cover, the title, and/or the design, your ideas
aren’t appropriate, and they need to be reworked before publication. (See
Chapter 4 for more about determining your book’s target audience.)
140
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

The thickness of the cover and whether it’s finished with a glossy or matted
look also impacts its appearance and showcases its quality. The most popu-
lar cover stocks are 10-point or a thicker 12-point, which is coated on one
side in either a glossy or laminate finish. See Chapter 10 for more about cover
stock.
Turning to Your Book’s Back Cover
After your book has grabbed the reader’s attention (by its title and design, 
of course) and said, “Look at me! Look at me!” the next job of your book’s
design is to convince your reader to flip the book over to read what’s on the
back cover. When someone has taken the time to make the flip and read the
back cover, it’s your chance to make a sale! You have to work fast, though;
you may only have that person’s attention for a few seconds.
The back cover of your book includes other important information. In the fol-
lowing sections, I describe all these elements and explain how to pull them
together in the overall design of the back cover.

141
Chapter 9: Judging a Book by Its Cover

The elements of a back cover
If you plan to sell your book through bookstores or retailers or want it to look
extremely professional, be sure to incorporate the elements in the following
sections into your back cover design.
The book description
The back cover text must convey all the important information that a poten-
tial reader may want and need in order to decide whether to buy your book.
Space on the back cover is limited, so every word and phrase must have
meaning and communicate the importance of your book.
Your back cover text should be sales oriented, well written, up beat, easy-to-
read, informative, and attention getting. Be concise and visually appealing in
the way it’s laid out (see “The overall look of a back cover” later in this chap-
ter for more back cover layout). In one or two short paragraphs, the back
cover needs to
 Explain exactly what the book is about
 Describe what the book offers and what makes it unique
 Inform the reader who the book is targeted to
 Establish credibility with the reader
 Create demand for the book and its content
To save space on the back cover, use a bulleted list when describing key fea-
tures or content. If your book is fiction, use the description to offer a brief
synopsis of the plot and main characters, without revealing too much.
Obviously, never reveal the ending!
The description of your book that appears on the back cover should provide
a summary of what your book is about and who it appeals to. This informa-
tion can be adapted from the marketing materials (such as the press release)
you’ve created for your book. Chapter 18 focuses on how to create a cohe-
sive marketing message to promote your book.
The art of writing effective back cover copy involves taking the most mar-
ketable, appealing, or valuable aspects of what the book offers and describ-
ing these areas using the most sales-oriented and believable words possible.
Never make statements or promises that you can’t keep or create expecta-
tions that the content of your book doesn’t live up to. If readers buy your
book based on lies, promises, or intentional embellishments of the facts, they
may feel ripped off, and you lose some credibility. You can also be sued.
Assuming that your book is informative, well written, and well researched,
you don’t need to make false claims about what your book offers.
142
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 

Information about the author and an author photo
An About the Author section on the back cover is optional, but it can be a
powerful tool for establishing credibility with the reader through listing your
primary qualifications, credentials, or educational background. This informa-
tion helps portray you as knowledgeable about the topic you’ve written. The
author’s credentials are less important for fictional works. For works of fic-
tion, write an About the Author section that readers relate to. It can contain
more personal information about the author, such as hobbies, interests, and
details about family and pets.
Within the author bio section, some authors opt to include a small publicity
photograph (a head shot). Many readers appreciate seeing a photo of the
author simply to satisfy their curiosity. Just like when you listen to the same
radio show day after day, you wonder what the radio host actually looks like.
It’s also customary (although not a requirement) to include an author’s photo
on the back cover or within the About the Author section of the book.
Chapter 18 is full of information on writing an author bio that you can tailor
for use on your book cover. You also find information on author photos.
If you have a Web site, be sure to list it within the About the Author section
on the back cover. Even if potential readers decide not to buy your book on
the spot, they may still visit your Web site later and order the book online.
See Chapter 21 for more about creating your own Web site.
The barcode, ISBN, and price
At the bottom of every book’s back cover, a barcode must be displayed in
black ink with a white background (called a vanilla bar code). Within this
area, the book’s ISBN must also be displayed in a readable font. (The barcode
and cover price for the book is also often printed within the inside front or
back cover of the book.)
The cover price of your book can be worked into the barcode through the
price add-on. This smaller barcode goes immediately to the right of the ISBN
barcode. The price add on begins with the number 5, which represents that
the price is stated in U.S. dollars, and is followed by the four digit price of the
book. For example, a book that’s priced at $18.95 would be listed as 51895 in
the price add-on section of the book’s barcode.
The cover price of the book should also be printed in a font that consumers
can read. You can place the cover price in the upper-left or -right corner or in
the lower-left or -right corner. If the book’s cover price is $18.95, the price
should be listed as U.S. $18.95 or $18.95 U.S.
To discover more about the technical specifications for reproducing your
book’s ISBN and related barcode on the back cover, visit the U.S. ISBN
Agency’s Web site (www.isbn.org). When you receive your barcode, the
information is supplied in the following standard specifications: 2400 dpi,
143
Chapter 9: Judging a Book by Its Cover

99.36 percent magnification, vanilla bar code, and price add-on. The barcode
can then be reduced slightly but should typically cover a total area of 13⁄4-x-
1 inches and 2-x-11⁄4 inches.
See Chapter 7 for more information on securing your book’s ISBN and bar-
code and establishing a cover price.
The Book Industry Standards and Communications 
(BISAC) Subject and Audience
As you find out in Chapter 7, selecting and choosing an appropriate BISAC
Subject and Audience Code helps booksellers and libraries categorize and
display a book in the appropriate section. For help choosing the appropriate
BISAC Subject and Audience Code for your book, visit www.bisg.org.
The BISAC Subject and Audience categories are typically displayed in small
type on the upper or lower left or right corner of the book’s back cover. Some
publishers opt to display this information near the barcode, while others
avoid including it altogether. By not including this information, you run the
risk of your book being displayed in the wrong area or section of a bookstore.
This misplacement makes your book harder to find and may result in lost
sales. Never assume that the title of your book is obvious enough that a
bookseller or librarian can automatically display it in the right section. You’d
be surprised how often mistakes are made because the book didn’t display
the appropriate BISAC Subject and Audience Code.
Publisher imprint information
The publisher of your book usually displays its name and logo somewhere on
the book’s back cover, typically in the lower right or left corner. In addition to
its name and logo, some publishers also display a Web site and/or address on
the back cover.
If you’re book is being published by your own publishing company using tra-
ditional offset printing, you can display your publishing company’s name and
logo (see Chapter 6 for more about creating your own publishing company).
If, however, you’re using a Print-On-Demand (POD) service (see Chapter 11
for details), technically that company is your book’s publisher and that’s the
company name that appears as the publisher.
Reviews and quotes
One or two excerpts of positive reviews of your book (from established
media outlets) or endorsements in the form of quotes from other well-known
experts, celebrities, business leaders, or trade associations are a powerful
sales tool and should be proudly displayed on your book’s back cover (if pos-
sible). These quotes quickly enhance your credibility and show the potential
reader that your book has already received praise from others. See Chapter
19 for more about reviews.

The overall look of a back cover
Placement of your book’s back cover elements is entirely up to you from a
creative and design standpoint. But keep the following issues in mind as you
settle on a design for your back cover:
 The description shouldn’t look too cluttered or take up too much space
on the back cover. The use of white space is important to ensure that the
copy is inviting and visually appealing.
 The back cover must contain all the necessary elements, including the
book’s description, information about the author, the barcode, price,
publisher information, and book category details.
 The design used for your book’s front cover (in terms of color scheme
and font selection) should carry over onto the book’s back cover.
 Your back cover copy should be used as a powerful marketing tool. In 5
to 15 seconds, it should convince a potential reader (who’s part of your
target audience) to purchase and read your book. If it doesn’t do this,
the back cover isn’t properly designed.
The back cover design used for The Bachelor’s Guide To Life (see Figure 9-4)
is rather basic, yet it includes all the key elements. Although plenty of infor-
mation is displayed on the back cover, there’s also plenty of white space, so
the design doesn’t look cluttered. Someone can pick up the book and quickly
find out what it’s about and who it appeals to.

Chapter 9: Judging a Book by Its Cover

Hire an experienced graphic designer with a flair for creating visuals to put
the title, text, and pieces of the front and back covers together into one visu-
ally appealing, professional-looking, and cohesive presentation. The graphic
designer you hire to create your book’s cover should have experience with
this type of work. See “Working with a Design Expert to Create Your Cover,”
later in this chapter for more about working with a designer.
Remembering Your Book’s Spine
The book’s spine can be a highly effective marketing and sales tool, espe-
cially if your book is sold in bookstores or at retail. When you visit any book-
store, most of the books are displayed sideways in order to conserve shelf
space, so all that’s typically visible is a book’s spine. Dozens of titles could be
crammed onto a single shelf, with your book stuck in the middle. How is your
reader going to find you?
If someone’s looking for a book about a specific topic, he may browse a shelf
in a bookstore that contains multiple titles. Most people glance at the title
printed on the book’s spine, and then they pull out only the few books that
truly capture their attention, based on the title and/or how well the title was
displayed and stood out on the spine. For more info on catchy titles, see
“Constructing a Catchy Title,” earlier in this chapter.
The most important thing to display on the book’s spine, in the largest possible
typestyle and font, is the book’s main title. You should also display the author’s
name and the publishing company (but this can be printed in a much smaller
type size). The font color and spine color should also stand out to capture the
attention of a casual browser. Make sure that the spine design is cohesive with
the design of the front and back covers.
Go to any bookstore, stand in front of the section where you believe your
book would be displayed, and examine the spines of competing titles.
Determine which books’ spines stand out and capture your attention and
why. Now, when designing your book’s spine, do something that makes it
stand out more than the competition.
Working with a Design Expert 
to Create Your Cover
Throughout this chapter, I stress how important it is to hire a professional
graphic designer to create your book cover, even if the printer or publisher
you choose to work with offers a basic cover design service as part of the
publishing package you’re already paying for.

Chapter 9: Judging a Book by Its Cover
Meet a book editor and cover designer
Susan Wenger is a professional book editor and
cover designer who works for Wheatmark
(www.wheatmark.com) — one of the lead-
ing POD publishers in the industry that caters to
self-publishers and first-time authors. You can
read more about Wheatmark in Chapter 11.
In seven years in the publishing industry, she’s
designed or contributed to over 100 book covers.
Most of the covers she’s done have been created
using the popular Adobe Photoshop software (a
powerful graphic design and photo editing tool).
When an author hires Wheatmark to publish their
book using POD publishing, Wenger is one of the
designers who provides the cover design ser-
vices offered by the company. Her job involves
working with authors to help them conceptualize
their book’s cover. Then, she takes those ideas
and incorporates them into an actual cover
design. She also often works closely with graphic
designers hired separately by authors to ensure
that the cover being created meets Wheatmark’s
technical specifications for printing.
Wenger recommends that before any work
begins on designing the cover, one must deter-
mined the book’s trim size (see Chapter 8 for
more about trim sizes). That way the designer
knows the exact measurements of the final
design. Often, if a design is created and then it
needs to be enlarged or reduced to accommo-
date a different trim size, it can distort the
design or require additional time to modify.
“When I start working on a new book project,
my first task is to have an in-depth discussion
with the author to find out about the book and
the vision for the cover. Some authors can pro-
vide very specific design ideas while others
leave it entirely up to me,” explained Wenger.
“Authors who are willing to share their ideas,
but give their graphic designer freedom to
explore their own creative expression are more
apt to end up with a book cover that’s unique
and professional looking. After I get an idea of
what the cover should look like, I begin search-
ing for the perfect cover image. This image
might be a photograph or an illustration,
depending on the type of book. Stock photo
agencies are a great resource for finding per-
fect images for book covers, because you can
quickly obtain a handful of images and then try
several in your cover design before narrowing
down your choice to one image.”
After the image is selected, Wenger begins
working with the specific text, such as the
book’s title and subtitle, that must be incorpo-
rated into the front or back cover. She looks at
various fonts and styles and makes her decision
based on how all the elements ultimately fit
together. “The job of the graphic designer is to
take a cover image, text, and other graphic
assets and combine them so they work seam-
lessly together to create the book’s cover,” said
Wenger. “Based on the topic of the book and
the cover graphic to be used, it’s usually easy to
select an appropriate font or fonts to display the
title, subtitle, and author’s name. I use a pro-
gram that allows me to see the title displayed in
multiple fonts at once, which makes the deci-
sion process a bit faster and easier.”
So what are a few cover issues that authors
should keep a close eye on? Wenger has a few
mistakes that should be avoided:
 A long title: The title should be short and
catchy or it won’t jump out at the potential
reader.
 Subtitles: A subtitle for a work of fiction isn’t
necessary and usually shouldn’t be used.
 Poor images: Digital photographs or art-
work that was saved in a very low resolu-
tion makes the images look awful in print.
Just because something looks okay on the
computer screen, that doesn’t mean looks
fine when it’s professionally printed.

148
Part II: Pulling Together the Details: Administration and Design 
When you simply utilize the cover design services of a POD company (see
Chapter 11), your cover often is created by someone quickly, using a previ-
ously created template. In many cases, the person designing your cover may
not even have professional graphic design experience.
Hiring your own graphic designer ensures that your book’s cover is given 
the right amount of personalized attention and that your creative vision is
adhered to. If you have no artistic flare or ideas about how you want your
book’s cover to look, professional graphic designers can also use their artis-
tic skills and creative visions to create an appropriate cover, based on infor-
mation about your book that you provide. I provide general information on
hiring a graphic designer in Chapter 8.
Suppose that you find someone to create your cover — great! Now what?
Start off by spending some time with your cover designer and describe your
book in detail. Make sure that the designer understands what your book is
about and specifically who your target audience is — your designer probably
won’t take the time to read your entire manuscript.
In order to supply your designer with this proper education, be prepared to
supply the following:
 The book’s title and subtitle
 A detailed description of the book and its audience
 The exact information you want on the book’s front and back cover
 A rough sketch or description of what you want the front and back cover
to look like with as many specifics as possible
 Any graphic assets you’ve already acquired, such as photographs, illus-
trations, or clip art that you want incorporated into the cover design
The fee you pay the graphic designer is for time worked and skill. If the
designer needs to acquire artwork, such as photographs or illustrations, be
prepared to pay separately for those graphic extras.
When you receive drafts of the cover design, share your like and dislikes with
your designer. Open communication ensures that you end up with a product
that you love. Do expect to go back and forth many times before you settle
on a final design. Remember, you’re paying the designer to help make your
book shine, so don’t be hesitant in saying what you like and don’t like.

Examining Printing
Choices

In this part . . .
P
rinting and publishing your book actually involve
several different methods and technologies. Which
method you choose is based on your budget, goals, distri-
bution plan, target audience, and the final look you’re
going for.
This part focuses on several different printing methods,
including traditional offset printing, Print-On-Demand
(POD) technology, eBooks, and local print shops. I also
give you tips on working successfully with any printer.

Chapter 10
Trying Out Traditional 
Offset Printing
In This Chapter
 Knowing the nuts and bolts of working with an offset printer
 Making important printing decisions
 Selecting the best printer
T
his chapter focuses on offset printing and is for self-publishers who plan
to establish their own small publishing company (see Chapter 6 for
details on this process) or who want to handle many of the tasks associated
with publishing a book themselves, without using a turnkey publishing solu-
tions (such as Print-on-Demand — POD). Offset printing, which has been
around since 1875, is the most widely used method of commercial printing in
the world. In this technique, an inked image is offset (transferred) from a
plate to a rubber blanket and then to the printing surface (the paper).
If you’re choosing a traditional offset printing option for your book, having
your book printed and bound is one of the most costly aspects of the whole
publishing project. You want your investment to result in the most profes-
sional looking and highest quality book possible, and poor printing and/or
binding impacts the look of your book and dramatically takes away from your
credibility. So going with a professional printer is your key to making your
book look its best.
In this chapter, I cover the basics of working with an offset printer, features
you can choose for your book, and tips for hiring a printer.

The Basics of Working with 
a Traditional Offset Printer
A professional offset printer capable of printing and binding books is very dif-
ferent from your local print shop that specializes in printing business cards
and stationery. In the following sections, I explain the pros and cons of using
an offset printer for your book and give you hints on finding a pool of reliable
printers. (You find out how to select the winning printer in “Hiring the Right
Offset Printer for Your Needs,” later in this chapter.)
The pros and cons of offset printing
The advantages of offset printing include 
 A consistently high image quality
 The fast and easy production of printing plates
 Lower per-copy printing costs than other printing options 
The disadvantages of offset printing include
 Offset printing requires a significantly larger upfront investment because
you have to pay for hundreds or thousands of books to be printed at once.
 You have to have a relatively large print run, which means you need to
maintain an inventory until the books are sold. You also run the risk of
not selling all your books if demand doesn’t meet expectations.
 You’re responsible for handling many more of the book publishing-
related tasks that a POD company may otherwise handle.
Finding reputable offset printers
You can find a reliable book printer in many ways: 
 Special interest magazine ads: These mags include 
• Writer’s Digest: www.writersdigest.com
• The Writer: www.writermag.com
 Referral databases: These databases are available to members of writ-
ing and publishing organizations. For example, if you’re a member of
The Independent Book Publishers Association (PMA), check out the
“Suppliers and Services” section on their Web site (www.pma-online.
org). Here, a small publisher can obtain a referral for a book printer that
152
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

advertises with the organization. Several dozen full-service book print-
ers are listed, along with contact information and a short description of
each company’s specialties.
 Online searches: Of course, you can also find a book printer by doing a
search online (use the search phrase book printing)
Many of the best offset printers for books are located in the northern
Midwest of the United States (especially Michigan and Ohio) because of
their proximity to Canadian paper mills, meaning they have some of the
lowest costs for paper. When first looking for a printer, self-publishers
should get comparative quotes from such standards in the industry as
Thomson-Shore, Data Reproductions, and Bookmasters.
 Yellow Pages: Look under Printers, Book Printers, or Offset Printers.
You may submit your book’s galleys electronically to the printer, and your
negotiations with the printer can be done by phone, fax, mail, or e-mail, so
there’s no need for the printer to be located in your immediate geographic
area. After your books are printed, they can be shipped anywhere.
Choosing the Features of Your
Traditionally Printed Book
The interior of most trade paperback books are published using 50-pound
white or natural colored paper with black ink. If you choose to use a fancier
paper stock or a different color paper, or if you use two or more ink colors
within the book’s interior, the book may look better, but your printing costs
increase. Likewise, if you choose to do something fancy with your cover, this
choice, too, impacts your printing costs. 
By using standard paper stock and basic printing options, you can still create
and publish a book that’s highly professional looking and visually appealing.
For most books, with the exception of high-end coffee table books or photo
books, your goal should be to publish a book that, in terms of quality of
paper, looks just like any other book you’d purchase at a bookstore — or
better. With professional layout (see Chapter 8) and a good cover design
(see Chapter 9), your printer should be able to produce books that meet or
exceed your expectations without charging you for a wide range of extras.
To be happy with the end result of your book, try some of these suggestions:
 Visit a bookstore and find books you want yours to imitate.
 Work closely with the printer to communicate exactly what you envision.
 Be open to advice and creative suggestions.
153
Chapter 10: Trying Out Traditional Offset Printing

The following sections help you decide what you want your book to look like.
After you select your book’s features, gather price quotes from potential
printers and narrow your choices until you decide on one (see “Hiring the
Right Offset Printer for Your Needs,” later in this chapter).
Visit www.printindustry.com/glossary.htm for a glossary of common
printing terminology. Understanding terminology used by printers helps you
better determine and communicate your needs and understand price quotes.
Trim size
The trim size of your book refers to its dimensions. A book’s trim size
impacts its page count. With a smaller trim size, fewer words fit on the page.
Therefore, the book has a higher page count and appears thicker. That same
manuscript printed in a book with a larger trim size has a smaller page count
and potentially cuts printing costs. The drawback, however, is that the book
appears shorter, because it contains fewer pages. You want to decide your
book’s trim size before you begin page layout to save yourself a lot of extra
work. See Chapter 8 for details about page layout and design.
For a trade paperback (the most common type of self-published book; see the
next section), common trim sizes include
 6-x-9 inches
 81⁄2-x-11 inches
 51⁄2-x-81⁄2 inches
 7-x-10 inches
Depending on the print run, most printers are willing to produce books with
any trim size that’s 81⁄2-x-11 inches or smaller.
Hard covers versus soft covers
Printing softcover trade paperbacks (which are paperback books that use a
thicker interior paper stock than newsprint and come in a variety of trim
sizes) or mass market paperbacks (which are the size of paperback novels
that use newsprint paper for the internal pages) is significantly less expen-
sive than printing hardcover books. However, hardcover books look more
formal and typically command higher cover prices. Although a mass market
paperback book, such as a novel (with a trim size of 4-x-63⁄4 inches), almost
always sells for under $8, a trade paperback book can have a larger trim size
and have a cover price from $9.95 to $39.99 (or more).
154
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

Most self-published books or books published by small publishers are pub-
lished as trade paperbacks. These books come in a variety of trim sizes, offer
full-color covers, and can be almost any length. They’re also suitable for both
fiction and nonfiction type books and are the most economical to print, espe-
cially in small to medium size print runs (under 5,000 copies).
Cover stock and coatings
The quality of the cover and the cover jacket is particularly important.
Covers come in different thicknesses (point size) and with certain coatings.
For example, for a trade paperback book, it’s common to use a 10-point or
12-point paper stock. You can then opt to add special coatings — glossy or
matte finishes — to the cover. You can also add UV protection to prevent 
discoloration from sunlight. Pretty cool, huh? You may get excited if your
book ever sits in a window display, but you’d hate for it to have sun damage!
The quality of the cover and the cover jacket for hardcover books is particu-
larly important, because the cover price of the book is significantly higher
and people expect to receive a high-quality product. For a hardcover, you
have a wide range of options in terms of cover stock and the stock used for
the book’s jacket. Your options vary by printer. Typically, the thicker the
paper stock you use, the more expensive the printing is. You’re also adding
costs if you ad coatings or laminates.
As you find out in Chapter 9, people do judge a book by its cover! In addition
to having a catchy title and a well-designed cover, you want your cover to look
professional and convey quality. Before making decisions about printing your
book’s cover, take a look at some other published books (especially your book’s
competing titles) and examine the quality of their covers. Choose some sam-
ples you like and then have your printer offer you quotes to create a similar
cover from a printing specifications standpoint.
Binding types
Books can be bound in a variety of ways. The binding refers to how the pages
are held together. The most common types of binding include
 Perfect binding: Most self-publishers opt for perfect binding, which uses
glue to attach the pages to the book’s cover. This binding type is most
commonly seen among books sold through bookstores. Self-Publishing
For Dummies is an example of a perfect-bound book. One benefit of per-
fect binding is that readers can clearly see the book’s spine when the
book is displayed sideways on a bookshelf.
155
Chapter 10: Trying Out Traditional Offset Printing

 Ring binding: Holes are punched in the pages, which are then inserted
into a traditional three-ring binder. This binding is ideal if pages need to
be taken out or replaced either by the publisher or reader. A ring binder
is mostly used for training manuals and other publications used in con-
junction with a training program or seminar.
 Comb binding: Plastic comb binding uses a piece of plastic with “teeth”
that fit into rectangular holes cut into each sheet of paper. Comb binding
is mainly used for books printed at a local print shop in very small quan-
tities. Keep in mind that bookstores and retail stores typically won’t sell
books with this type of binding, and the plastic binding itself could crack
or break. This type of binding also doesn’t look too professional.
 Coil, wire, or wire-O binding: This binding (also called spiral binding)
refers to one piece of plastic (coil) or wire that forms a continuous coil
that holds pages together by weaving in and out of many small holds cut
into the book’s pages. This type of binding is ideal for cookbooks and
other types of books that need to lie flat, without being held. 
 Thermal binding: A heat fused cloth tape or plastic strip is used along
the side of the pages to seal them together. This binding is an option for
small print runs, typically when the book isn’t going to be sold at retail.
 Saddle stitch binding: Staples are used to hold folded over pages
together. This binding technique is used more for binding booklets and
magazines. Staples can also be used along the edge of the book and then
concealed with cloth or paper tape. This type of binding can’t be used for
thick books, and you don’t have a traditional spine that can display text.
So, displaying the book sideways on a bookstore’s shelf isn’t practical.
 Case binding: This binding method is used for hardcover books and
involves using thread to sew the pages together. If you’re creating a
hardcover book, this is a sturdy, classic-looking binding.
For very small print runs, where you print or photocopy your book at a local
print shop (see Chapter 12), comb, coil, wire, thermal, or saddle stitch bind-
ing may be appropriate. To see these types of binding, visit these sites:
 Book Binding Pros: www.bookbindingpros.com
 FedEx/Kinko’s: www.fedex.com/us/officeprint/main
Paper weight and color
The weight of the paper used for the interior of your book refers to its thick-
ness. Using a thicker paper stock improves the look of the book from a quality
standpoint and makes the spine of the book thicker, but remember that by
using a thicker (heavier) paper, your printing costs may increase.
156
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

A certain kind of paper is usually used with different book types. For example:
 A hardcover book might use a slightly heavier paper than a trade 
paperback.
 A trade paperback often uses a 20-pound white or off-white paper
(but there are options).
 Full-color books often use a brighter white paper with a glossy finish.
 Mass market paperback books are typically printed on a less expensive,
newsprintlike paper. 
The use of color in the interior
Adding color gives you creative freedom and adds a tremendous amount of
visual appeal to your book if used correctly. For example, the interior of most
books are printed on white paper with black ink, but you can use two-, three-,
or even full-color spreads in your book to add visual appeal, highlight impor-
tant information, or categorize information. 
The more colors you incorporate into your book’s interior design, the higher
your printing costs may be.
Interior art, photos, and illustrations
Depending on the type of book you’re publishing, incorporating artwork, pho-
tographs, illustrations, charts, diagrams, or figures of any kind add to the visual
design of the book and makes it easier to convey certain types of information.
Although a novel typically doesn’t incorporate any artwork, a how-to book on
plumbing, for example, may use photographs or other graphic elements to
help the reader identify certain parts of a plumbing project.
When you start to include more types of artwork in your book, your printing
costs may start to climb. These costs vary based on the technology used to
layout and design your book and the process that’s used to print the books.
To keep costs down, make sure that you supply artwork to the printer in a
format of at least 300 dpi and has clear, true photographic quality. Most print-
ers charge either by the hour or by the image digitally edited or enhanced
artwork that appears in your book. Printers supply guidelines for artwork of
various types. Stick to these guidelines.
157
Chapter 10: Trying Out Traditional Offset Printing

Inserts
Depending on the type of book you’re publishing, you may want to bind some
type of insert into the book, such as a CD, subscription card, perforated
coupon, checklist, stickers, or a fold-out poster. Most printers who are
equipped to handle inserts, however, charge extra for this service, based on
the type of insert. Prices vary by printer. You’re also responsible for provid-
ing the insert in a format that’s ready to be bound into the printed books.
These formats also depend on the printer that you’re working with.
Adding an audio CD, DVD, or CD-ROM into your book can increase your print-
ing costs by up to $3 per copy but allows you to increase your cover price
dramatically because of the value of the added content you’re offering.
Hiring the Right Offset 
Printer for Your Needs
Various printers use different equipment and specialize in different types
of print jobs. In the following sections, I give you a few issues to consider
upfront, explain the importance of customer service and proper pricing, and
clue you in on what happens after you hire the printer of your choice.
What are a few upfront considerations?
To start with, you want to choose a printer based on the following:
 The company’s experience in publishing books similar to yours: Ask to
see sample books with similar printing specifications to what you antici-
pate needing.
 The professional quality of the output: When you initially contact a
printer, ask to see actual printed samples of the company’s work. Upon
request, a professional book printer can send you a handful of sample
books it has printed so you can evaluate the quality of the work.
 The equipment available: For books printed by an offset printer, com-
panies often outsource the job to a printing company or facility located
overseas. Where the book is printed becomes important to you only if it
in any way impacts the overall quality, professional appearance, cost,
and printing schedule for your book.
 Scheduling issues: After you decide exactly how you want your book
printed and you’re gathering price quotes (see “Is the price right?” later
in this chapter), determine the time needed for the initial printing and
158
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

how long the publisher requires for subsequent print runs. Making spe-
cial demands relating to your print job also often requires additional
time, which can delay the overall printing process. If the printer is
extremely busy or overbooked, delays in your publishing schedule can
occur, resulting in lost sales or money spent on ineffective advertising,
marketing, and public relations. 
Every step in the book-printing process takes time. Rushing this process
can lead to costly mistakes. I’ve seen some mistakes such as photographs
being printed upside down and glue in the binding that’s still wet.
 Payment terms: For first-time orders, many printers require at least a
50 percent down payment with the balance due on shipment. For any
order, make sure that the terms are agreed on upfront and that you have
the terms in writing.
 Warehousing and order fulfillment services: Some printers warehouse
your books and handle order fulfillment on your behalf (for a fee, of
course). The storing of your books can ultimately save you money
because you don’t need to have the books shipped from the printer to
your own warehouse (at your expense), and then have those same books
shipped from your warehouse to your customers. You can also save time
and money by having your orders fulfilled directly by the printer, assum-
ing the printer offers competitive rates for these services.
Unless you’ve found a printer through a referral from a reputable organization
or someone you know, do a bit of research about the company before making
a hiring decision. Contact your local Better Business Bureau or ask to speak
with past clients. (Visit the Better Business Bureau’s Web site at www.bbb.org
and click “Locate a Bureau.”) It’s not uncommon for printers to be family-owned
or to have been in business for 50 or more years, so look for a well-established
and reputable company to work with.
How is the customer service?
After making contact with a printer, you may be assigned an account represen-
tative. This person is your primary contact person at the printing company.
He or she answers your questions, negotiates pricing with you, and helps
guide your book through each stage of the printing process.
Interview the rep assigned to you so you can tell whether you can have a
solid working relationship. Ideally, you want to work with a representative
who understands your needs and who’s willing to invest the time in working
closely with you. You should have faith in this person’s knowledge and be
able to work well together. You want someone who’s readily available to
answer all your questions, addresses your concerns, and makes sure that
every phase of the printing process goes according to plan and stays within
your budget (especially if this is your first time working with a book printer).
159
Chapter 10: Trying Out Traditional Offset Printing

Is the price right?
The printing business is highly competitive. Have printers spec out your job
and offer a price quote, and then shop around for other quotes to ensure that
you’re being offered a good deal. There’s always room to negotiate!
Providing crucial information
Although you can begin making contact with printers anytime, you can’t
begin soliciting bids for your print job or gathering price estimates until
you’ve determined exactly what your needs are. Each of these considerations
impacts your costs and what your printed books look like. 
Printers typically have a form that you fill out for quote requests, but in order
to obtain an accurate quote, be prepared to provide the following informa-
tion about your book (I cover these issues in detail earlier in this chapter):
 Desired trim size (the dimensions of your book)
 The book’s length (the total number of pages)
 Whether you’re publishing a hardcover, trade paperback, or mass-market
paperback
 The cover stock 
 Number of colors to be used on the book’s front and back cover
 The type of binding desired 
 The paper stock and color 
 Ink color 
 Whether color is used in the book’s interior
 Whether the book contain an insert, such as a CD, DVD, or CD-ROM
In addition, be prepared to provide information about the following items:
 Contact information: Include your name, address, e-mail address, and
so on.
 Book-specific items: List the title of your book, whether you’ve acquired
your own ISBN, bar code, copyright, and other book-specific items (see
Chapter 7 for details) or whether the printer needs to do these tasks on
your behalf (typically for an additional fee).
 Format: Include the format of the content of your book and the book’s
front and back cover art and how it is supplied to the printer.
160
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

 Initial print run (quantity of books to be printed): Some printers accept
orders for as few as 100 books. However, to dramatically reduce the
printing cost per book, receive quotes for 500, 1,000 and 2,500 (or more)
copies, assuming you anticipate being able to sell this quantity of books
over the long term and don’t mind having to inventory them until they’re
sold. For small print runs, seriously consider using POD technology
(covered in Chapter 11).
 Timeline: How quickly you need the printing job done. Most printers
charge extra for “rush” jobs. Figure out your overall publishing schedule
and find a printer that can work within that schedule. 
 Packaging: Whether the book needs to be shrink wrapped and boxed in
a specific way. Special requests typically cost extra.
 Shipping: How and where you want the books shipped after they’re
printed. You’re responsible for shipping charges, so you need to decide
how you want the books shipped and how quickly you need them to
arrive (see Chapter 16 for shipping details). The faster the shipping
method, the more you pay, especially for heavy boxes of books.
 Additional services: Include copy editing; layout and design; cover
design; preparation or editing of artwork to be used within the book;
having multiple proofs created; rush printing services, and so on.
For the most accurate quote, you also may need to provide the printer with a
copy of your book’s manuscript or galleys (the laid-out and designed pages).
Reviewing quotes carefully
After you provide all the information in the previous section, the printer then
can provide you with a written price quote. This quote should list all the print
job’s specifications exactly. If anything isn’t listed, it should be discussed and
a new quote should be issued before accepting it. The quote then lists all the
prices associated with the print job, including a total price. 
Many book printers have Web sites that calculate instant quotes. This service
can be useful when estimating a budget, but use these quotes for estimate
purposes only, and be prepared for a higher final quote.
After receiving a price quote that looks reasonable, sit down with the printer
(or talk over the telephone) and go over every line of the quote to ensure
that you understand what everything means. Ideally, you should also have
the printer provide you a sample of another book that’s already been printed
that looks similar to yours, so you can see firsthand what to expect.
161
Chapter 10: Trying Out Traditional Offset Printing

If you decide to move forward after receiving a written price quote, you sign
the quote indicating you’ve accepted those terms. Sometimes you then
submit a deposit (often nonrefundable) and/or apply for credit terms with
that printer.
Beware of hidden and unexpected charges when calculating your printing
budget and evaluating quotes. When you get a quote, it’s based exactly on
the printing specifications you initially provided. Any deviation from what’s
listed on the price quote may result in additional charges depending on who
makes the changes. Make sure that you understand exactly what services are
included in the quote you’re given and that you understand exactly what the
final printed books look like.
Shop around for the best prices and services based on your needs. If you
receive two vastly different price quotes, determine why before choosing the
company that provided the lowest quote. One printer may be quoting the job
based on less expensive paper, for example.
What happens after you hire a printer?
After you agree to a price and officially hire the printer, determine exactly
how your galleys (the edited and laid-out interior pages) and cover artwork
need to be submitted and in what format. You also need to sign a contract or
work order with the printer to establish a formal relationship. To avoid delays
and extra fees, be sure to adhere to the guidelines provided by the printer,
especially when it comes to preparing photographs and illustrations to be
printed in the interior of the book and developing the book’s front and back
cover. Providing digital photographs in the wrong resolution or in the wrong
format can negatively impact their appearance within the book (Chapter 8
has more about photo sizing and formatting).
The printer you choose becomes one of your publishing company’s most
important service suppliers. If your book sells well, you want to be able to
quickly reorder books or use the same printer for future publishing projects.
Your goal should be to build a long-term relationship with the printer of your
choice. To do so, check out these steps:
 Develop a basic understanding early on about costs and scheduling.
 Openly communicate with the printer throughout the process. 
 Make sure that all your needs, questions, and concerns are addressed.
 Make sure that your printer understands your needs and what you envi-
sion your final printed books should look like.

hired, check out Chapter 13.

Print-On-Demand for Demanding
Self-Publishers
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of Print-On-Demand technology

O
ne of the most cost-effective ways to self-publish a book and have many
of the often confusing steps in the publishing process handled on your
behalf is to pursue Print-On-Demand (POD) self-publishing. POD is fast and
inexpensive and offers authors many options to create and publish their own
book. Authors can also make their book available to potential readers through
online distribution channels and potentially through bookstores and other
retail outlets. POD utilizes the latest printing and publishing technologies to
create a wide range of options for authors. For most people interested in pur-
suing self-publishing, POD is an extremely viable option.
This chapter explains POD and offers the information you need to take
advantage of this relatively new technology to publish your book through
turnkey POD solutions. These turnkey solutions take much of the guesswork
and busy work out of publishing and distributing any type of book because
they handle virtually all the tasks on the author’s behalf. While the author is
responsible for writing and editing his own manuscript, these companies
handle everything from layout and design to distribution. Self-published
authors pay for a publishing package based on their needs but don’t have to
worry about things like obtaining an ISBN, getting the book listed with online
booksellers, or filling orders from customers.

164
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 
Taking a Quick Tour of Print-On-Demand
Technology
POD is very different from traditional offset book printing (which I cover in
Chapter 10), although the end product is the same. Here are the major differ-
ences between offset printing and POD technology:
 Traditional offset printing: In this technique, an inked image is trans-
ferred from a plate to a rubber blanket and then to the printing paper.
The book’s cover is printed separately and then the entire book is
bound to create a finished product.
 POD technology: When POD books are printed, high-end, 600 dpi
(dots per-inch) laser printers are used. These industrial-quality laser
printers print on 20-pound white bond paper, using black toner, to print
the pages of the book, one copy at a time, as needed. A separate, full-
color printing process is used to print each book’s cover (reproduced
at 300 dpi). The POD books then use proprietary binding technology,
allowing for either a perfect-bound or coil-bound book to be created.
(For binding information, see Chapter 10.)
Some POD publishers offer additional customization options for final printed
books, allowing authors to request (for an extra per-copy fee) higher-quality,
24-pound white paper for their book’s inside pages. Full-color pages can also
be incorporated within the book, and you can add CDs or other flat objects
that are pasted inside the book’s back cover (also for an additional fee, which
impacts the book’s final cover price). Check out “Working with companies to
manage money issues,” later in this chapter for more about fees you may pay.
Looking at the Pros and Cons 
of Print-On-Demand
POD is definitely a popular choice among self-publishers for a variety of rea-
sons. This section focuses on the many benefits of POD, as well as some of
the potential drawbacks.
The benefits of Print-On-Demand
POD offers many benefits, especially to first-time self-publishers and people
looking for complete publishing solutions that aren’t too expensive. Check out
what I’m talking about in the next few sections.

Avoiding a lot of hassle
POD makes getting published easy for any author and to have the majority of
the hassle taken out of the process. The biggest benefit of this technology is
that a complete turnkey solution is offered, so you don’t mess with the every-
day things of the publishing business. (See “Surveying the Print-On-Demand
Process,” later in this chapter for more details.)
Make sure that the POD company you choose gives your book project the
one-on-one attention needed and that no pre-created templates are used when
creating your book’s front cover. Using a template makes the cover design
process much faster but limits the designer’s creatively and takes away the
opportunity to create a unique book cover. Chapter 9 has cover design details.
Saving money
Back in 1995, the world of publishing changed dramatically with the introduc-
tion of POD technology. For decades, if an author wanted to have her book
published, her options included working with a major publishing house or
publishing her own book with offset printing, which was an extremely costly
endeavor. Even today, most authors don’t have $10,000 to $20,000 to invest in
the offset publication of their own book plus additional funds to properly
market, promote, and distribute. Now, in a matter of weeks and for an invest-
ment of between $300 and $1,500, anyone can have a book published and made
available to the public.
Here are the major differences between the two printing processes:
 If you published your book through traditional offset printing technol-
ogy, to make the process cost effective, hundreds or thousands of copies
of the book would need to be printed during each print run. This means
the publishing house or author needs to potentially pay thousands of
dollars upfront to have a book designed, printed, and warehoused, even
before a single copy is sold. For anyone who needs only a small number
of books, POD is an extremely viable and cost-effective option.
 Conversely, POD requires only a small initial financial investment pri-
marily because the technology used allows for just one copy of the book
to be professionally printed and bound at a time after orders for the
book are actually received. After the initial set-up process with a POD
publisher, when an order is placed for a POD book, it immediately gets
printed and shipped to the customer, retailer, or distributor, typically
within one to three business days. That means that you don’t have to
invest in or store mountains of books until they’re sold.
If you know you want to self-publish your book, whether you choose to use
POD versus traditional offset book printing (see Chapter 10) or even eBook
publishing (see Chapter 12), you need to crunch some numbers to determine
what makes sense based on your budget, sales expectations, and ability to
market and distribute your own book.
165
Chapter 11: Print-On-Demand for Demanding Self-Publishers

166
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 
To determine if POD is worth it for your book publishing project, perform a
simple cost-benefit analysis. The printing costs per copy by using POD are
significantly higher than using traditional book printing methods, which take
away from your per-copy profit potential. But, the initial financial investment
is significantly lower. With POD, virtually all the major steps involved with
bringing your book to print (after the manuscript is written and fully edited)
are handled on your behalf. You pay for these services as part of the publishing
package you purchase, but the time and money you save can be significant in
the long run, and you take on much less of a financial risk when you publish
your book using POD.
Want to crunch some numbers? Based on the number of copies you antici-
pate selling, calculate how much profit you can earn per copy sold when
comparing POD with other publishing options. This can be accomplished by
figuring out your costs and comparing them. When you make contact with a
POD publisher, they can help you calculate your costs after you know basic
information like the length of your book and what printing specifications
you’re looking for. Chapter 6 helps you plan your publishing budget.
Enjoying speed and versatility
After your manuscript is completely written and edited, POD allows you to
have your book published in a matter of weeks, not months or years. You can
choose from a wide range of printing specifications, including the book’s trim
size and paper stock, then print books as they’re sold — even if it’s one copy
at a time. POD requires a much lower financial investment and greatly reduces
the self-published author’s risk.
The drawbacks of Print-On-Demand
Depending on how you plan to market and distribute your book, POD can be
an extremely viable publishing solution. It does, however, have certain draw-
backs. The following sections explore some of them.
Rejecting returns and standard credit
The biggest drawback of POD is that most of the companies don’t accept
returns from booksellers, retailers, and distributors. All the major publishing
houses do accept returns (typically within 90 days) if a book doesn’t sell.
By not accepting returns, booksellers or distributors must commit to buying
and then selling all ordered copies of your book and often must order multiple
copies (at least ten) in order to receive a standard 40 to 60 percent discount
off of the cover price.
Another related drawback is that booksellers and distributors aren’t given
industry-standard credit terms. All orders must be pre-paid. Lack of buying
on credit combined with the no returns policy make it extremely difficult for
authors who use POD to sell their book through traditional booksellers and

other retail stores because these places don’t pay in advance and cycle their
books for returns when they don’t sell. Therefore, if people want to purchase
your book, they need to make their purchase directly from the POD company,
from the author, or from an online service such as Amazon.com or Barnes &
Noble.com (see Chapter 14 for details about these services).
One way around these drawbacks is for you, the author, to pre-purchase a
large quantity of books and sell them directly to distributors or booksellers
and offer industry-standard discounts and returns. This procedure, however,
may greatly reduce your book’s profit potential because you pay around 40 to
60 percent of the book’s cover price to purchase copies of your own book for
resale. In this situation, it’s often more cost-effective to use more traditional
book printing methods as opposed to POD; see Chapter 10 for details about
offset printing.
Handling issues with layout and design
When it comes to the layout and design of books, in some cases, POD also
has small drawbacks:
 The resolution and the way photographs and artwork are incorporated
into the book
 The type and quality of paper used for the internal pages
 The use of full-color within the inside pages
Although the author has many options when choosing the printing specifica-
tions of the book using POD, this is a different printing technology than what the
major publishing houses use to print their books. This high-end laser technol-
ogy is quickly improving, but there are certain issues that relate to the quality
of photographic images and the type of paper that can be used for a book’s
internal pages. Each POD publisher uses slightly different technology, so it’s
important to request actual samples of books and discuss printing limitations
with the company you choose to work with.
If cost isn’t an issue, offset printing is always better, but you’re talking an
investment of thousands of dollars — not hundreds.
Surveying the Print-On-Demand Process
Just like with traditional offset book publishing (which I cover in Chapter 10),
using POD to design, publish, distribute, and market your book is a multi-step
process. The good news is that many of the POD companies handle a lot of
the confusing steps in the process on your behalf. In the following sections,
I steer you through the major steps in the POD process and explain what a
POD company needs from an author to start the printing process.
167
Chapter 11: Print-On-Demand for Demanding Self-Publishers

168
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 
As soon as you begin working with a POD company, you get a project man-
ager who is your primary contact. This person walks you through the entire
self-publishing process using POD and can answer your questions.
Looking at the major steps
After the completion of your manuscript, you should make sure that your
text undergoes rigorous editing, as I discuss in Chapter 5. Many POD compa-
nies can help you hire an editor, for an additional fee, but most assume that
your manuscript is ready to be laid out and printed after it’s received.
After your manuscript is ready to begin the POD process, follow these major
steps:
1. Select a POD company, such as iUniverse, Trafford, or Wheatmark.
I discuss these companies in detail later in this chapter.
2. Submit your manuscript to the POD company.
You also turn in your artwork, the Author’s Agreement (provided by the
POD company), your payment, and a variety of other materials (see the
next section).
3. Complete the layout and design process (including the scanning of art-
work as needed), along with your book’s cover creation process.
This step can take between two and six weeks, depending on the com-
pany you work with. But you have creative input during each stage of
your book’s development process.
If you want to maintain total control over the design of your book, you
can opt to handle the book’s internal page layout and design, as well as
the creation of your book’s front and back cover, yourself. Meeting the
POD company’s exact technical specifications is necessary, however.
Some POD companies offer a discount if you handle the layout and
design of your own book and provide it in the form of a ready-to-print
PDF electronic file. Chapter 8 focuses on book layout and design.
4. You receive an author proof of your book from the POD company.
The proof is a mock-up showing exactly what each page of your book
looks like. This stage is your final chance to make last-minute edits and
ensure that the layout and design of the book is exactly as you envi-
sioned it. You have about 14 days to submit any corrections or changes.
(I cover proofing in more detail in Chapter 13.)
5. Make revisions and prep the final book for publication.
This chance is your final one to make edits, fix errors, or improve the
content of your book before it’s printed and made available to the public.
Proofread your book carefully!

6. Begin promoting your book through advertising, marketing, and
public relations.
Remember, this step is important because you’re solely responsible for
it. Plan your public relations, marketing, and advertising carefully so
you can maximize your budget and reach the most potential readers.
See Part V of this book for full details.
7. Start selling and distributing your book.
Your POD company ensures that your book is listed on services such
as Bowker’s BooksInPrint.com (a comprehensive directory used by
bookstores and libraries that lists all books currently in print),
Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, and Borders.com. The POD com-
pany also notifies major book distributors about the publication and
availability of your book.
The POD company also drop-ships copies of your book to your customers
as orders are received. So, whether it’s an individual, a bookstore, or a
distributor that orders your book, the POD company prints books and
fulfills orders as they’re received. (These services are built into the fees
and commissions you pay to the POD company.)
Many of the POD companies that offer turnkey solutions also offer a wide
range of extra services to help you market and promote your book. In some
cases, these services are included in the publishing package you purchase.
You may, however, have to pay extra for them based on your needs. Check out
“Working with companies to manage money issues,” later in this chapter for
more about fees you may pay. Chapter 13 also includes general information
about working successfully with any printer you hire.
Knowing what a POD company 
needs to get rolling
To ensure that your book turns out exactly the way you envision it, provide
the POD publisher with everything they need. This includes the internal
pages of your book (after they’ve been fully edited, laid out, and designed)
as well as your book’s cover artwork. This section focuses on preparing the
materials your POD publisher needs from you.
Materials for layout and cover design
When your manuscript is complete and edited and you’ve collected all the
photos, illustrations, and artwork to be included in the book, you’re ready to
turn your work over to a POD company for the layout and design process.
169
Chapter 11: Print-On-Demand for Demanding Self-Publishers

170
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 
If the POD company handles your page layout and design and your front and
back cover design, plan on providing the following materials:
 A print out (hardcopy) of your entire edited manuscript
 An electronic version of your manuscript (in Microsoft Word) format
 Copies of any graphics, images, artwork, or photographs to be included
within the book complete with figure reference numbers. Make sure that
each piece of artwork is properly labeled and meets the technical speci-
fications spelled out by the POD company you’re working with. (See
Chapter 4 for more about artwork in your manuscript.)
Many POD companies have a limit regarding the number of photographs
or pieces of artwork that can be included within the book (if you want
more, there may be additional fees). The number of photographs or
pieces of artwork allowed varies based on the publishing package you
purchase and the POD company you work with. By paying extra, however,
an unlimited number of photographs or pieces of artwork can typically
be incorporated into your book.
 PDF files of your page layout and design (if you’ve done it yourself) that
are ready to print. See Chapter 8 for details on how to do this. In many
cases, the POD publisher you hire handles your page layout and design
for you. If this is the case, you can offer ideas or even sketches of what
you’d like your book’s pages to look like.
 A sketch or draft of the book’s front cover and/or information about the
cover you need designed by the POD company. If you’ve had your cover
pre-designed by a professional graphic artist or have done the design
work yourself (see Chapter 9 for details), you need to supply the final
cover artwork in a format that meets the POD company’s specifications.
One way to ensure that your book’s interior layout and design comes out
the way you envision it is to look at other books and provide the graphic
designer with actual samples you like. You can even take design elements
from several different books to create something unique for your book.
Information about the book and its author
When you initially begin working with a POD company, you need to provide
specific information about your book and your vision for it. Some of the
details you’re asked for include
 Your book’s complete title and subtitle (if applicable)
 The category or genre the book fits into, such as fiction, how-to, self-help,
poetry, cookbook, and so on
 The main subject matter your book covers
 The book’s intended audience

 The desired trim size of your book (usually a minimum 5-x-5 inches and
maximum 81⁄4-x-103⁄4 inches for perfect-bound books)
 The type of book you want — trade paperback, hardcover, and/or eBook
(see Chapter 12 for information on eBooks)
 The type of binding you prefer (see Chapter 10 for details on binding
types)
 A short description of your book (one or two sentences)
 A more in-depth description of your book (a paragraph or two)
 Keywords or phrases that could be used by a potential customer when
they’re searching for your book (be prepared to provide up to a dozen
keywords or phrases)
 Biographical information about the author
 A photograph of the author
 The completed author questionnaire provided by the POD company
(if applicable)
 The signed Author’s Agreement provided by the POD company
 Your payment to the POD company
Picking a Great Print-On-Demand
Company for Your Book
The POD business has grown dramatically in recent years and many companies
are starting to offer these services to self-published authors. This section
focuses on a few of the more established and better known POD publishers
that offer complete turnkey publishing solutions.
Finding and thoroughly 
researching companies
When it comes to choosing a POD printing solution for your book, you have
many options. I cover three prominent POD companies later in this chapter;
you can find additional companies online using any Internet search engines
and the search phrase Print-On-Demand book publishing.
171
Chapter 11: Print-On-Demand for Demanding Self-Publishers

172
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 
All POD companies aren’t alike. Each offers slight differences in the services
offered and prices charged, based on what’s included in the respective POD
publishing packages. You may discover that some POD companies offer a la
carte layout and design, POD printing, distribution, and promotional services
to authors instead of complete turnkey solutions. Depending on how much of
the self-publishing process you want to handle yourself, this option may be a
viable for you.
To find the right POD company capable of meeting your needs, first focus on
what your needs are in terms of your book’s design, printing, publishing, dis-
tribution, and marketing. After that, follow these guidelines:
 Find a POD company you can afford. Keep in mind, most of the POD
companies offer several different publishing packages for authors at 
different price points. Each package includes specific services.
 Research the company’s history and reputation. Make sure that the
company has experience publishing books similar to yours and is 
well-established. Interview a representative from the company and
request to see actual samples of work. Also, ask for a list of references
or information about past clients.
 Look for quality. The print quality of POD books can vary, and in gen-
eral doesn’t quite meet the consistent standards of offset printing.
Whenever possible, it’s wise to find samples of POD books from a par-
ticular company not provided by that company, because the company
tends to select the best print runs for samples. Even with a single print
run, the print quality can vary, just the way the quality of laser copies
can vary with the amount of toner in the machine, how old it is, how
carefully quality is monitored, and so on.
 Choose a company that offers the specific services you need and can
benefit from the most. Some POD companies focus more on book design
and printing, while others are better equipped to assist you in marketing,
promoting and distributing your book.
As you prepare to have your book published through a POD company, here
are a few other important things to consider:
 The initial cost of the publishing package being offered
 The services included with the publishing package
 How and when royalties are calculated and paid to the author
 The discount at which you can purchase copies of your book from the
POD company
 The amount of time the POD company needs to publish your book from
the time it receives the manuscript
 How much control, if any, you have over the book’s cover price

 How much marketing, advertising, and public relations support you plan
to receive from the POD company and what form that support may take
 What discount is offered to bookstores, retailers, libraries, and book dis-
tributors and whether returns are accepted by the POD company
 Whether the POD company offers credit terms to established distributors,
booksellers, libraries, and other retailers, or if all orders must be pre-paid
Before choosing a POD company, always read the company’s Author Agreement
and other contracts carefully. These documents are legal and outline the ser-
vices to be offered and their related fees. Then calculate your overall budget.
Determine approximately how many copies of your book you need to sell in
order to break even on your investment, then determine if that sales figure is
feasible, based on the distribution, sales, marketing, advertising and publicity
opportunities you anticipate being available to you (see the next section for
money matters).
As an author, you pay the POD company a pre-determined fee for a specific
publishing package, and then you’re able to purchase copies of your published
book at a discount of up to 60 percent off the book’s retail cover price. Each
POD company offers several publishing packages at different price points.
Also remember that unlike when you work with a major publishing house,
when you use POD to publish your book, you retain all rights to your book,
including the copyright. See Chapter 6 for the full scoop on copyright.
Working with companies 
to manage money issues
The POD company you choose helps you make important decisions about
your book’s cover price, while ultimately impacting your profit margin. This
section deals with some of the financial issues and decisions you need to
contend with as a self-publisher using POD.
Watching out for hidden costs
Many first time authors don’t pre-calculate all the costs associated with pub-
lishing their book. Using a turnkey POD solution helps control costs, but
there are still many expenses you can incur in addition to the POD publishing
package you purchase. These expenses include editing services, acquiring
artwork, graphic design, and publicity.
Determine exactly what services are included in the POD publishing package
you’re purchasing and what additional services you need and have to pay for,
and feel free to ask your contact person any and all questions.
173
Chapter 11: Print-On-Demand for Demanding Self-Publishers

174
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 
POD companies specialize in publishing and distributing your book — not
marketing and promoting it. Getting word out about your book is solely the
author’s responsibility. You can, of course, hire professional salespeople and
public relations people to help you. If you don’t properly promote your book,
no matter how good the book actually is, it won’t sell. It’s that simple. See
Part V for the lowdown on publicity, marketing, and advertising.
Pricing your book
Every book has a cost per copy to print, based on the number of pages and
its binding. Most POD companies provide you with the exact printing cost
per copy and require that your book’s cover price be at least 21⁄2 times the
printing cost per book.
This pricing model ensures that you, as the author, as well as the POD com-
pany, can make ample profit on each copy of the book sold. This pricing
model also allows for a standard 15 to 60 percent discount off the book’s
retail cover price to be offered to recognized book distributors, booksellers,
and libraries that order your book.
As the author, you also want to be able to purchase copies of your book from
the POD company at between 40 to 60 percent off the book’s cover price and
have the option to resell books directly to customers for the book’s cover
price. Most POD companies also initially supply you with a pre-determined
number of free copies of your book, based on the publishing package you buy.
Here’s an example: In 2006, the printing cost of a 260-page trade paperback
book was $9.03 per copy. The minimum cover price for that book is $22.57
(21⁄2 times the per-copy printing cost). As the author, you could increase your
profits by boosting the cover price to $24.95 or $29.95 (or higher), based on
how much you believe potential readers are willing to pay for your book.
When you use POD, as the author, you have the option to purchase books at
a discount (ranging from 40 to 60 percent off the cover price). You then have
the option to resell those books at the cover price in order to earn your profit.
Some POD companies give authors input into their book’s cover price.
Others don’t. Your book’s cover price can have a tremendous impact on its
profit potential. Pricing it correctly can mean the difference between earning
a profit and losing money on your publishing venture over the life of your
book. Check out Chapter 7 for details about setting your book’s cover price.
Calculating your royalties
Every POD company has a different formula used to calculate an author’s roy-
alties. As books are sold, you receive a royalty based on a pre-determined
percentage of the gross profit earned per book. Some POD companies offer up
to a 60 percent royalty on gross profit from each copy sold. Another part of
this equation is based on how the book is sold, either directly by the author

or POD company, through a distributor, through an online bookseller, or
through a traditional retailer. Make sure that you understand the formula
your POD company uses to calculate your royalties.
To calculate how much of a royalty you earn per book, determine if the cus-
tomer pays the full cover price or purchases the book at a discount. Here are
some scenarios:
 Direct sales: If your book’s cover price is $29.95 and one copy is sold
directly to an individual from the POD company for the full cover price,
here’s how to calculate your royalty:
• Take the cover price (in this case, $29.95) and subtract the printing
costs (in this case $9.03). This leaves $20.92 in gross profit.
• As the author, if you receive a royalty of 60 percent of the gross
profit, you’d earn $12.53 on the sale of that book.
 Retail booksellers: If the book is sold through Amazon.com or a tradi-
tional bookstore or distributor, which purchased the $29.95 book at a
wholesale price of 50 percent off of the book’s cover price ($14.98),
here’s how to calculate your royalty.
• Subtract the printing costs ($9.03) from the discounted book price,
which leaves a gross profit of $5.95.
• As the author, you’d then earn a 60 percent royalty on $5.95, which
is $3.57 per copy sold.
With this drastic difference in royalties, your obvious goal, to be able to
make money, is to sell hundreds or thousands of copies of your book.
 Author sales: You purchase copies of your book directly from the POD
company as the author, and you probably receive a 40 to 60 percent 
discount off the book’s cover price, depending on the quality of books
ordered. This means that you’d purchase the $29.95 book for $17.97
(40 percent off), then be able to resell it directly to customers at $29.95
and earn $11.98 per copy.
You can sell copies of your book to your existing customers and clients when
you make author appearances, give lectures, or sell books directly from your
Web site. By using this scenario, however, you’re responsible for fulfilling
orders and potentially maintaining an inventory of books. Fear not, though;
I give you details on order fulfillment, inventory, and shipping in Chapter 16.
Royalties are typically paid by the POD companies to the author on a quar-
terly basis. This timeline varies, however, depending on the POD company
you work with. Some companies may pay on a monthly or semi-annual basis.
Be sure to ask your contact person about royalty payments before you sign a
contract so you know what to expect.

Checking Out a Few Prominent 
POD Companies
Three POD companies offer turnkey solutions for authors interested in self-
publishing their book:
 iUniverse: Phone (800) AUTHORS: Web site www.iuniverse.com
 Trafford: Phone (888) 232-4444; Web site www.trafford.com
 Wheatmark: Phone (888) 934-0888; Web site www.wheatmark.com
I describe these companies in the following sections, but keep in mind that
these are just a sampling of the many printing and publishing companies that
offer turnkey POD solutions. I mention these three companies because they’re
prominent in the industry. Check out “Finding and thoroughly researching
companies” earlier in this chapter for tips on finding additional companies
and checking their credentials.
Amazon.com has launched its own POD service for writers and authors called
BookSurge. Using this service guarantees placement on Amazon.com and
Amazon.com’s worldwide affiliates. BookSurge also allows books to have full-
color inserts and be printed in paperback or hard cover with a wide range of
book trim sizes and paper stocks. Call BookSurge at (866) 308-6235, ext. 128,
or visit the following Web site: www.booksurgepublisherservices.com.
iUniverse
iUniverse offers a variety of publishing services to help individuals publish,
market, and sell books. For authors interested in POD, iUniverse offers several
publishing packages, ranging in price from $299 for its Fast Track package to
$799 for its Premier Plus package.
 The Fast Track package offers limited services, including basic page
layout and design along with basic cover design.
 The Premier Plus package features all the services you need to design
and lay out your book, create the front and back covers, and make trade
paperback, hardcover, and/or eBook editions of your book available.
The package also includes acquiring the book’s ISBN, barcode, copy-
right, and Library of Congress Card Number on your behalf.
In as little as 30 days after supplying iUniverse with your fully edited manu-
script, your book can be published and ready to be purchased on online
booksellers and from more than 25,000 booksellers and e-retailers worldwide.

Other publishing services included with the more expensive publishing pack-
ages offered by iUniverse include
 Determining the retail cover price of your book
 Distribution (all books published by iUniverse are available for sale at
www.iUniverse.com)
 Editorial evaluation
 Marketing toolkit
Manuscripts to be published by iUniverse must be at least 10,000 words in
length (this word count results in a 48-page book). If you want to include up
to 25 graphics or photographs within your book, an additional fee of $100
exists. For 26 to 50 images, add $200 to the cost of the publishing package.
According to iUniverse, the company publishes both hard- and softcover
books in a variety of sizes. Visit the company online for more information.
Trafford
Trafford is a pioneer and leader in the POD industry. The company’s publish-
ing packages range in price from $699 for its basic “Legacy Classic” package
to $1949 for its comprehensive Best Seller Plus package.
Each publishing package offers a variety of services designed to offer authors
a complete publishing solution, based on their needs. Unlike iUniverse,
Trafford gives authors some input into the retail cover price of their book.
This input can impact your profit potential dramatically because you can
select a lower cover price than what the printer recommends, but your profit
margin per book decreases.
Trafford offers discounts for various reasons:
 For booksellers, distributors, and libraries; however, no returns are
accepted
 For authors who do their own interior page layout and design, as well as
create their own front and back book cover
To help you calculate your costs and anticipated revenue from your book,
Trafford offers a Publishing Profit Calculator on its Web site. A free, 20-page
publishing guide can also be downloaded.
Trafford also lists books on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, and Borders.
com, and it also notifies BooksInPrint.com and other services about the pub-
lication of new books.

Chapter 11: Print-On-Demand for Demanding Self-Publishers

Wheatmark
Wheatmark is an example of a smaller POD publishing company that offers
many of the same services as its larger competitors, as well as services com-
panies such as iUniverse and Trafford don’t offer. Here’s a sampling of their
services:
 Wheatmark works with authors to market and promote the books that
initially sell over 2,000 copies.
 Wheatmark offers industry-standard wholesale discounts to all book-
sellers and distributors, and they accept returns.
 Wheatmark employs highly trained graphic designers who work with
authors on original cover designs for each book.
 Wheatmark specializes in publishing trade paperback books in variety of
trim sizes.
 Wheatmark boasts that it offers better discounts to authors, a higher level
of personalized service, and competitively priced publishing packages.
Wheatmark offers its standard POD publishing package to authors for $799;
however, it has a menu of a la carte extra services, ranging in price from $69
to $299 each. Although the company includes an ISBN and related barcode
with its publishing package, it charges extra to register the copyright with
The United States Copyright Office on your behalf. (Head to Chapter 7 to find
out how to register copyright yourself.)
All books published using Wheatmark’s POD services are automatically listed
with Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, Borders.com, and BooksAMillion.com
and are made available on Wheatmark’s own online bookstore. The company
also works closely with Ingram Book Company, one of the country’s leading
book distributors. By listing a book with Ingram, the book is made available
to any bookstore nationwide. For more information, visit Wheatmark online.

Checking Out Some 
Non-Traditional 
Printing Options
In This Chapter
 Looking at the basics of eBook Publishing
 Formatting, pricing, and distributing your eBook
 Using your local print shop
M
any people think of a book as a printed paperback or hardcover that’s
professionally bound and something you’d find in a typical library or
bookstore. Most traditional books take on this form.
There are, however, other ways of distributing your book-length manuscript
to potential readers. This chapter explores a couple of non-traditional pub-
lishing options: the creation and distribution of eBooks (electronic books)
and the use of a local print shop for small quantities of books.
The Basics of eBook Publishing
Even though eBooks haven’t reached acceptance in the mainstream quite yet,
publishing an eBook is an easy, inexpensive, and technically savvy way to
reach readers. In the following sections, I define eBooks and their audience,
and I explain the pros and cons of turning your manuscript into an eBook.
Examining eBooks’ setup and audience
eBooks are full-length books that are distributed in electronic form, typically
via the Internet. They can be purchased online, downloaded, and read on a
computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), Smartphone screen, or printed

out on the reader’s own printer. In terms of layout and design, the internal
pages of the eBook look similar to a traditional book. In the following sec-
tions, I explain how to read eBooks and describe their typical audience.
How do you read an eBook?
To read an eBook, it’s necessary to have eBook reading software on your
computer or PDA device. This software is typically distributed free of charge
and allows eBook pages to appear as traditional book pages on a screen.
One of the biggest problems with eBooks is that there are at least a dozen dif-
ferent eBook formats, each requiring a different type of reader. Some of the
more popular eBook readers include
 Microsoft Reader (www.microsoft.com/reader/default.asp)
 Adobe Reader (www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.
html)
 eBook Reader for Palm (www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/
readerforpalm.html)
 Pocket PC (www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readerforppc.
html)
For more about these programs, see “Formatting your eBook,” later in this
chapter.
The Sony Reader is another device for reading eBooks released in 2006. The unit
is about the size of a trade paperback book and weighs nine ounces. It holds
about 80 full-length eBooks in memory. The eBooks can be purchased from
Sony’s own online eBook store, called Connect. The Sony Reader also displays
PDF files and plays MP3 audio files. For details about this innovative eBook
reader, check out products.sel.sony.com/pa/prs/index.html.
Who actually reads eBooks, anyway?
When eBooks were first introduced, the hope was that they’d quickly replace
traditional books, just as CDs made LPs and even cassettes virtually extinct.
Well, that never happed. Most readers seem to prefer to hold a traditional
book in their hands and manually turn the pages when they’re reading.
Yet, a niche and slowly growing audience for eBooks does exist. The good
news is that some avid readers simply enjoy the convenience of downloading
text to read on screen. For example, if you’re a frequent business traveler,
you can take along your laptop or PDA and hold the full contents of several
books and have access to them anytime you wish.
Making your book exclusively available as an eBook dramatically limits your
potential audience. Therefore, it’s a sound business strategy to publish your
book in both traditionally printed and eBook form.
180
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

Understanding eBook benefits
Publishing an eBook has big benefits:
 The cost of actually publishing an eBook is virtually free. You don’t
incur printing costs or warehousing fees. After the book is created in
eBook format, it’s ready to be sold in any quantity.
 eBooks can be unlimited in length and contain any type of text, pho-
tographs, or graphics. The length of the book and extra graphic elements
don’t impact production cost or the publisher’s requirements when set-
ting retail pricing.
 eBooks can be edited and modified quickly and cheaply. After the doc-
ument is created, it can be edited or revised in a matter of minutes.
 Distribution of an eBook can be done via a Web site, e-mail, or on
CD-ROM. From the publisher’s standpoint, an eBook is simply a digital
file that can be distributed just like any other digital file.
Also, many companies have discovered that making just the user’s man-
uals or technical reference materials for their products available in eBook
form is an extremely cost effective solution for distributing this material.
(See “Distributing your eBook,” later in this chapter for details.)
From the reader’s standpoint, the benefits of eBooks are the following:
 An eBook can be read anytime and anywhere, and multiple eBook titles
can be stored on a computer, PDA, or Smartphone.
 The text in an eBook can be searched just like when you read a Web site
and use hyperlinks and searches within an eBook to jump around the
text and quickly find specific information you’re looking for.
 The price of an eBook is typically about half of what a traditional printed
book costs, and who doesn’t like a bargain?
Recognizing potential eBook drawbacks
Some potential drawbacks of publishing an eBook include
 Having trouble reading eBooks: For example: After someone purchases
an eBook, he has the option of printing out the entire document on a
printer, but this takes time and uses up ink (or toner) as well as paper.
 Reaching the broadest eBook reading audience: This audience is small
to begin with, so your eBook must be created and distributed in multiple
eBook formats, such as Portable Document Format (PDF) (for Acrobat
Reader and Acrobat eBook Reader), Microsoft Reader format, and Palm
and Pocket PC eBook Reader format.
181
Chapter 12: Checking Out Some Non-Traditional Printing Options

 Gathering a small audience: In addition to being interested in the sub-
ject matter of your book, an eBook reader needs to be savvy enough to
use an eBook reader on a computer or PDA and be willing to use this
technology to actually read a book-length document on their screen.
 Having trouble with displaying details: eBook readers for smaller
devices, such as PDAs and Smartphones, have difficulty displaying
detailed graphics and photos.
The Details of Putting Out eBooks
When it comes to eBook publishing, after your content is created, you need
to format that content so it can be read and accessed by people using the
most popular eBook readers. You also must develop pricing for the eBook
edition and then find the best ways to distribute your eBook. The good news
is that publishing eBooks is much cheaper than publishing traditionally printed
books. The problem, however, is that the profit potential is significantly lower.
This section focuses on how to create an eBook edition of your book.
Most self-published authors benefit from publishing their book in printed
form and offering an eBook edition. This extra edition allows you to reach the
broadest possible audience. Publishing only an eBook edition saves you a for-
tune but greatly limits your audience.
Formatting your eBook
For every popular eBook format, there are a handful of tools designed to
help you format and transform your book-length manuscript into an eBook.
This process can be simple or require a lot of effort, depending on how fancy
you want your eBook to look and how many different formats you want to pub-
lish your eBook in. In the following sections, I cover three popular formats.
The PDF Store Web site (www.pdfstore.com) offers a wide range of eBook
publishing tools and resources designed to assist first-time eBook publishers
and authors. Here, you find eBook publishing software packages, such as
NitroPDF and Palm eBook Studio, which can be used to format eBooks for
Palm easily. You can also download virtually all the popular eBook reader
programs from this site for free.
To add professionalism, many eBook publishers design their eBook pages
just as they would for a traditional book before publishing and distributing it.
To accomplish this task, load your manuscript (Microsoft Word format) into
a page layout and design program, like Quark, Microsoft Publisher, or Adobe
InDesign CS2 (see Chapter 8), to properly format each page so it takes on the
appearance of a book. The formatted document can then be converted into a
PDF file or another eBook format and distributed electronically as an eBook.
182
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

The Adobe Reader format
You can take any Microsoft Word document and use Adobe Acrobat to create
a PDF file that can be read using either Adobe Reader or Adobe eBook Reader.
This process takes just a few minutes. The PDF file can then be distributed as
an eBook.
Adobe Acrobat is a software package published by Adobe that can be used to
create PDF files from almost any type of computer document, such as Microsoft
Word or any application in the Microsoft Office Suite. To open and read a PDF
file on any computer or PDA, Adobe Reader, Adobe eBook Reader, or a com-
patible program must be used. These programs are free and already installed
on millions of PCs, PDAs, and Smartphones around the world. Versions of
Adobe Reader are available for the PC (Windows), Mac, Symbian, Palm, and
Pocket PC operating systems.
The biggest benefit to publishing your eBook in Adobe Reader format is that
it’s the most widely used eBook Reader software in the world and available
on a variety of platforms. Therefore by publishing your eBook in this format,
you’re able to cater to the needs of a large eBook reading audience. The Adobe
Web site (www.adobe.com) is an excellent resource for discovering eBook
platform and how to best use it as part of your publishing efforts.
The Microsoft Reader eBook format
Microsoft Reader is used for reading eBooks on a PC or laptop computer.
Two other versions of this eBook reading software are also available for the
Pocket PC and Windows Mobile operating systems, making it possible to
store and read eBooks on PDAs and Smartphones that run under these
Microsoft operating systems.
Formatting an eBook to be compatible with Microsoft Reader is easy, as long
as you adhere to certain compatibility guidelines, which the Web sites listed
below describe. eBooks can be created using Microsoft Word, Microsoft
Publisher, or a variety of other page layout and design tools. To find out more
about the Microsoft Reader format and how to format eBooks to the proper
specifications, download these free eBooks:
 Layout Guide for Microsoft Reader: www.microsoft.com/reader/
developers/downloads/layout.asp
 Microsoft Reader Source Materials & Conversion Guide: www.
microsoft.com/reader/developers/downloads/source.asp
The Palm eBook Reader format
One of the most successful distribution methods for eBooks has been
through Palm OS compatible personal digital assistants (PDAs). By loading
eBook reader software (such as eReader or eReader Pro for Palm OS) into
your Palm OS compatible PDA or Smartphone, eBooks can be stored in the
hand-held device and read on the screen, anytime and anywhere.
183
Chapter 12: Checking Out Some Non-Traditional Printing Options

Formatting your eBook to be compatible with Palm eBook Reader can be
done by using specialized formatting software or any program that allows
you to create PDF files.
Several software packages are available to help eBook authors and publish-
ers format and publish their eBooks in the Palm OS and Pocket PC format.
One of the most popular packages is eBook Studio, which can be downloaded or
demoed at www.ereader.com/product/detail/15001. For more informa-
tion about how to publish an eBook so it’s compatible with Palm OS devices,
visit the PalmSource Web site at www.palmsource.com/interests/ebooks.
Pricing your eBook
Generally, most eBooks are priced at about half of what the same tradition-
ally printed book title would sell for. So, if the trade paperback edition of your
book sells for $19.95, the eBook edition might sell for $9.95. Head to Chapter 7
for details on how to set the cover price of your printed book.
Depending on how you plan to market and sell your eBook (see the next sec-
tion), you can formulate the best possible suggested retail price, based on
what you believe people are willing to pay. Be sure that the price you set for
your eBook covers your costs associated with writing the manuscript and
includes any marketing, advertising, and distribution you plan. If you plan to
create and host a Web site to sell your eBook, there’s a cost associated with
this. This cost should be built into your eBook’s retail price. Likewise, if you
know you need to pay an eBook store a high commission for selling your book,
this too needs to be calculated into your cover price. Generally, you want to
charge one price for your eBook. Don’t offer the same book and content at
vastly different price points from different Web sites.
The cheaper your eBook is, the more copies of it you may sell. Established
online eBookstores (which I cover later in this chapter) often help you set a
reasonable retail price for your eBook.
Distributing your eBook
You can distribute your eBook in three primary ways:
 Create your own Web site to promote, sell, and distribute
 Sell your eBook online, through established eBookstores
 Distribute your eBook for free with a product purchase
I cover these methods in the following sections.
184
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

Just as you can use many different sales and distribution methods to sell tra-
ditionally printed copies of your book, you can also tap different distribution
methods to sell your eBook edition. For example, you can offer the book
through the established eBookstores and sell it directly to readers via your
own Web site. When you make personal appearances, you can also sell the
eBook edition on CD-ROM. Based on what your sales goals are and who your
target audience is, focus on distribution methods that help you best reach
your intended readers.
Selling through online eBooksellers
The established online eBookstores sell your eBook on your behalf and fulfill
the orders, and they pay you a preset licensing fee or royalty, which is typi-
cally 40 to 60 percent of the selling price.
The biggest benefit to distributing your eBook through established eBooksellers
is that the people shopping at these sites are typically avid eBook readers
who already have the technological know-how to download and read eBook
content. The drawback is that these eBooksellers often charge you a commis-
sion to promote your book on their site.
To have your eBook listed on various eBookstores’ Web sites, contact each of
them separately and fill out a publisher contract and agreement. A few popu-
lar eBookstore Web sites include
 www.ebooks.com
 www.ereader.com
 http://ebooks.palm.com
 www.ubibooks.com
 www.amazon.com
Due to lack of demand, Barnes & Noble no longer supports or sells eBooks
from its retail stores or Web site.
Web site marketing
One of the biggest benefits of creating your own Web site and selling your
eBook online is having a totally automated business opportunity and revenue
generator. After the Web site is set up and your eBook is published and ready
for download, all you need to do is promote the Web site to potential readers.
Visitors to your Web site can then find out more about your eBook, perhaps
read an excerpt, purchase the eBook online using a major credit card or PayPal,
and automatically download the book and start reading. Check out Chapter 21
for details on how to create a stellar Web site for your book.
185
Chapter 12: Checking Out Some Non-Traditional Printing Options

Handing out a freebie
If your company publishes book-length owner’s manuals, user’s guides, or
technical materials for its products, it can save a fortune by making these
books available in eBook form on CD-ROM (as opposed to printed form) 
or as a free download from its Web site when the product is purchased.
Thousands of companies are now using eBooks to distribute information
instead of printing manuals, guides, and other materials.
For in-house use, employee training manuals, annual reports, press kits, and
other lengthy documents can also be transformed into eBooks for easy and
inexpensive distribution.
Heading to a Local Print Shop
Suppose you’re about to give a lecture or teach a seminar and you want to
create a workbook for participants to take home. Perhaps you have an idea
for a book that lends itself better to a workbook format, bound in a three-ring
binder (allowing pages to be removed with ease). For small print runs, your
local print shop probably offers the perfect printing and binding solution. In
the following sections, I give you the pros and cons of using a print shop and
tips for ensuring that your book looks as professional as possible.
Knowing when to use (and when 
to avoid) a print shop
Consider photocopying your book, manual, or guide if
186
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 
Having a killer Web site
For promoting and selling eBooks online, a type
of Web site exists that is referred to as a Killer
Mini Site. It features just one main Web page
but includes a focused sales message designed
to sell your eBook. A Killer Mini Site format
works well for selling a wide range of how-to
and nonfiction eBooks. A typical Killer Mini Site
consists of a header graphic, headline, testimo-
nial, product information section, benefits section,
a call to action, a guarantee, and a summary all
on one Web page. Ask your Web site design
company or ISP for information about how to
design, write, and launch a Killer Mini Site for
your eBook.

 The print run is relatively low (under 100 copies)
 A trim size of 81⁄2-x-11 inches is suitable
 Your book doesn’t have traditional retail distribution
 You want the ability to add and remove pages from the final document
 You don’t want to invest the time and effort in designing and laying out
an entire trade paperback or hardcover book
The advantages of using a print shop to publish a book include the following:
 Printing cost: Your local print shop probably offers high-speed copiers
capable of quickly copying, collating, and even binding documents from
25 to 500 pages (or more) in length. The good news is that when photo-
copying your book, there are no minimum print runs, so if you need
one copy or 100 copies, you pay the local print shop just a few cents
per page for photocopying services, plus a bit extra for binding.
 Cover price: Manuals, workbooks, research reports, and how-to guides
targeted to business professionals can command a significantly higher
cover price than a traditional trade paperback book.
 Convenience: You can visit a local print shop, have your documents
printed and bound (often while you wait or within a few hours), and
then pick up the finished product without having to pay shipping costs
or waiting for the published books to be shipped to you. Working with a
local printer also allows you to oversee the printing firsthand. You may
want to shop around for a local printer that offers competitive pricing as
well as the best high-end printing equipment capable of generating the
most professional looking output.
Maintaining a professional look
If you’re going to photocopy your book and have it bound at your local print
shop, the end result may look more like a business report than a published
book. And without an ISBN number and associated barcode (see Chapter 7 for
details on these items), the photocopied document isn’t suitable for retail sale.
Follow these hints to ensure that your book looks as professional as possible:
 Make double-sided copies. Many photocopiers can easily create col-
lated, double-sided copies. This process saves paper and adds a more
professional look to the finished product.
 Make sure that the photocopier you use is high-quality and generates
professional looking output. The print shouldn’t be washed out due to
low toner. Ask to see samples of past work.
187
Chapter 12: Checking Out Some Non-Traditional Printing Options

 Make color copies. Although using a high-speed copier to make black
and white copies of your book or manual is cost effective and ideal for
many projects, a color copier can be used to reproduce full-color images,
photos, or other artwork. Many print shops can use a color copier and
thicker paper stock to create an eye-catching cover, which can then be
laminated to add a professional touch to your photocopied project.
 Use quality paper stock. To enhance the look of your photocopied docu-
ment, consider using a higher quality paper than standard 20-pound
white paper. Photocopying a large number of pages on brightly colored
paper (using black toner) can make the document hard to read. For the
main pages, stick to white, off-white, or cream-colored paper.
 Choose a good binding. The binding you choose also impacts the pro-
fessional appearance of the finished product. (See Chapter 10 for details
on binding methods.) You also can have holes punched along the left
margin of your pages and insert them into a three-ring binder. (If you’re
using a three-ring binder and photocopying a significant number of books
over the long term, consider having the binder custom imprinted with
full-color text and graphics.)
 Focus on creating a professional overall design. Every aspect of design
and layout, use of graphics, fonts, typestyles, and white space on each
page makes a difference. Chapters 8 and 9 focus on how to create profes-
sional looking page and cover designs using programs such as Adobe
InDesign CS2, Microsoft Publisher, or QuarkXPress.
Many print shops can print directly from an electronic file, so create
pages with a nice layout and design, save the document as a PDF file,
and then print copies as they’re needed at your local print shop.
This method is a less formal method of using Print-On-Demand, which
I cover in Chapter 11.

T
here’s nothing worse than working hard on your book, creating great con-
tent, and then having the project ruined by a shabby print job. The poor
quality could ultimately make your book look amateurish and cause you to
lose credibility among your readers. So printing is one of the major important
steps in your publishing process. The methods you use and the printing com-
pany you hire determine how much you spend on production, how long it
takes to have your books printed, and the overall look and quality of your fin-
ished books.
Finding a printer who’s knowledgeable and qualified is important, but just 
as important is staying in contact with your printer during each step of the
printing process. Developing a good rapport with your printer helps ensure
that every step of the printing process goes smoothly and that the finished
product is something you can be truly proud of. In this chapter, I take you on
a quick tour of the general printing process and provide you with important
questions to ask any printer as you work together. I also give you the scoop
on smoothly handling proofreading and wrapping up any loose ends before
your books enter the world.

Walking through the General 
Printing Process
The two major printing options you have are traditional offset printing (see
Chapter 10 for details) and Print-On-Demand (POD) publishing (see Chapter
11 for details). Although the two methods use different technology, they
mostly follow the same general printing process. Important steps in this
process include
 Defining your exact printing needs: Determine the book’s trim size,
page count, ink colors, and type of paper to be used.
 Finding a printer capable of meeting your needs: Obtain referrals and
contact printers. See Chapters 10 and 11 for details on finding referrals
for offset printers and POD companies.
The Graphics Arts Information Network (GAIN) is a professional associa-
tion composed of graphic designers and printers. From this group’s Web
site (www.gain.net), you can obtain referrals for printing companies,
read informative articles and industry news headlines, and find out
about related industry associations.
 Researching potential prices and negotiating your best price: After you
know exactly what your print job entails, solicit quotes from a handful of
printers and negotiate the best price.
• Obtain a price quote from an offset printer. Use one of two ways:
Visit a printer’s Web site and fill out an online questionnaire and
have a quote e-mailed back to you, or call or visit a printer and dis-
cuss your needs in person.
• Check out POD companies. POD businesses usually have package
deals with preset prices. Some offer an a la carte menu of printing
options and allow you to pick and choose the printing specifica-
tions for your book for a totally customized print job.
 Turning over the final materials of your book to the printer: This step
requires simply submitting your materials in electronic form (as a PDF
or PostScript PRN file, depending on the printer’s requirements).
• Traditional offset printing submission: You most likely handle the
design and layout of the interior pages and the creation of the
book’s cover either by yourself or with the help of a professional
designer. (Chapter 8 has the scoop on layout; Chapter 9 has details
on cover design.) Review and make any necessary corrections to
those laid-out files first (see the proofing checklist later in this
chapter for edits to watch for), and then submit those materials to
the printer.
190
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

• POD submission: After you review and make any necessary correc-
tions to your manuscript, turn it over in a Microsoft Word docu-
ment for layout and design and work with the POD company to
develop a cover design.
 Having a proof created by the printer: This creation gives you a sample
of what your final product looks like after it’s printed.
 Making any last-minute edits or changes to the proof and then approv-
ing them: Review your proof carefully. This stage is your absolute last
chance to make changes and correct any errors. See “Surviving the
Proofing Stage,” later in this chapter.
 Printing and binding your books: This process varies based on your
preferences and the printing method you’re using (see Chapter 10 for
offset printing and Chapter 11 for POD companies).
 Shipping or warehousing your books: Unless you’re using POD, after
your books are printed, they’re boxed up and shipped to your ware-
house (or any address you provide); I cover shipping and warehousing
in more detail in Chapter 16. Some printers also handle warehousing and
order fulfillment on your behalf, but be aware that an extra charge exists
for these services.
Getting on the Same Page 
with Your Printer
Ensuring that your book turns out exactly how you want it requires both you
and your printer to be on the same page (pun intended). You need to develop
a basic understanding of printing terminology and have a vision for your fin-
ished product. It’s also necessary to ensure that your printer understands
exactly what you’re trying to achieve and how the printed books should look.
A misunderstanding or failure to communicate may cause mistakes that
could become extremely costly to fix.
In the following sections, I show you how to ask the right questions, under-
stand technical terminology, and share your vision of your book with your
printer during the printing process.
Asking appropriate questions
Initially, before settling on which printer or POD publisher to hire, you need
to gauge the printer’s level of expertise, experience, and willingness to work
with you on your publishing project. See Chapter 10 for help choosing an
191
Chapter 13: Working Successfully with Any Printer

offset printer or Chapter 11 for help selecting which POD publisher to work
with based on your individual needs.
To assess these qualifications, ask questions to help you move forward with
your process. These inquiries should relate directly to the process, schedul-
ing, and expectations (both what’s expected of you and what you should
expect from your printer). Try out the following list of questions to get you
started:
 Have you printed books that meet similar specifications to mine? If so,
can I see some samples of your work?
 What options can you offer in terms of cover and paper stock?
 From the time I provide my manuscript, what’s your turnaround time for
printing books?
 Do you need front and back cover artwork in advance?
 How will the books be shipped to me, my distributor, or warehouse after
they’re printed?
 For offset printers, what price breaks can I receive based on printing var-
ious quantities?
 In what electronic format do you need me to provide my book’s cover
design and internal pages?
Becoming technically savvy
If your printer relies on using technical lingo to describe everything, but
doesn’t take the time to explain things in ordinary terms, either seek out a
different printer or brush up on your printing terminology. Many offset print-
ing companies and POD publishers are happy to have your business and are
capable of printing your book. Choose a company that employs people you’re
comfortable working with and one that doesn’t make your head spin.

Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

Relaying your message
Communicating your vision for what you want your book to look like is criti-
cal. The printer and any other folks working on your book during the printing
process need to understand exactly what your book should look like in order
to meet your expectations. It’s up to you to educate them about what your
book’s about, who the target audience is, and what you’re envisioning from a
creative standpoint.
One way to do this is to find books at the bookstore or library that you want
yours to replicate in terms of the printing specifications (trim size, cover
stock, paper stock, and so on) and show those samples to your printer. It’s
much easier for printers to match actual samples than it is for them to inter-
pret your verbal description.
Surviving the Proofing Stage
Just before the presses start to roll, the printer or POD publisher provides
you with a proof. This sample is what your book looks like when it’s printed.
Depending on the printing process and the company you use, the proof form
may vary. You may receive a proof in electronic PDF format or an actual
printed and bound copy of your book.
If your book has multiple colors, ask to see a high-resolution full-color proof
that accurately shows how the colors look. The colors you see on your com-
puter screen vary greatly from how they look in final print.
Whatever form the proof takes, it’s now your responsibility to review every
page of the proof and correct any errors. (Depending on the printing com-
pany, you may be charged extra to make corrections at this point; neverthe-
less, this is still the last opportunity to make them.) After you accept the
proofs and sign off, the book goes to press and the printer assumes no
responsibility for any mistakes or errors that should’ve been caught by you.
In the following sections, I steer you through a proofing checklist and give
you tips on hiring a professional proofreader.
Following a proofing checklist
By this point, you and your editor (see Chapter 5) should’ve reviewed the
manuscript several times. If any changes still need to be made at the proof
stage, they should be minor, unless you’re correcting a mistake made by the
printer.
193
Chapter 13: Working Successfully with Any Printer

This final development requires you to review the proof multiple times, look-
ing for specific types of errors. Take your time when completing this process.
The following list is chock-full of things to look for when reviewing your proof
for the last time before your book actually gets printed. For each item on this
checklist, review your proof looking for just that type of mistake or problem:
❑Correct spelling mistakes.
❑Perform a final check of all names, phone numbers, Web site addresses,
statistics, facts, and figures to make sure that everything is accurate.
❑Correct grammatical errors.
❑Fix any layout and design mistakes, such as mislabeled and misplaced
photos or figures and their captions, headings and subheadings, page
numbers, or running headers or footers.
❑Ensure that text or content hasn’t been accidentally left out.
❑Make sure that no characters are missing at the end of headings, para-
graphs, or sentences.
❑Double-check the order of the chapters (and then numbering of the
chapters) and sections within your book and that all elements of the
content are in the right place, including the book’s front matter and back
matter (see Chapter 4 for more about these elements).
❑Make certain that all figures and graphics are correctly placed, refer-
enced, and numbered.
❑Certify that all photos and artwork are correctly positioned (not upside
down or flopped).
❑Review all captions to make sure that they correspond to the correct fig-
ures or photographs.
❑Check that the page numbers are all in sequence and correctly posi-
tioned on each page.
❑Double-check all margins to make sure that they’re straight and consis-
tent throughout the book.
❑Make sure that all chapter or page number references within the book
are accurate (for example, if the text says, “As seen in Chapter 4 . . .” 
or “See page 123 . . .,” that the appropriate page, chapter, or section is
referenced).
❑Check all fonts and typestyles for correct displayed and that all chapter
title pages, headings, subheadings, and so on are uniform in their
appearance and formatting.
❑Review the print quality, ensuring that it’s uniform, clear, and profes-
sional looking, especially when it comes to the photographs, artwork,
and graphics.
194
Part III: Start the Presses! Examining Printing Choices 

Catching a last-minute error is one step. The next involves instructing the
printer on exactly how to correct each error. This process is best done in
writing (not verbally or via e-mail) to avoid miscommunication. Ideally, you
want to mark up the actual pages of the proof with a blue or black pen, and
fax or hand deliver those edited pages to the printer. After the corrections
are made, request a revised proof (even if you’re charged extra for it). You
want to make sure that all corrections have been made accurately.
Hiring a professional proofreader
When you hire your professional editor, you can also negotiate with her to be
responsible for your final proofreading before the book goes to press. Major
publishing houses, however, use a professional proofreader (someone differ-
ent from the editor) to handle this task. For an additional fee, you can hire a
professional proofreader to review your manuscript with a fine-tooth comb. I
advise this extra step if you have the budget to hire this specialist.
A professional proofreader has experience looking for common and not-so-
common layout and design errors as well as grammatical and spelling errors.
These people are extremely detail-oriented, and they know exactly how to
ensure your book’s professional look.
To hire a professional proofreader, follow the same guidelines as hiring an
editor or graphic designer:
 Check out the popular freelancer Web sites.
 Ask people you know for referrals.
 Check out the qualifications of the person you’re interested in hiring.
 Hire someone with extensive experience proofreading books.
The cost of a proofreader varies greatly based on the length of your book, the
experience of the proofreader, and the time it takes to proofread the book. A
proofreader, however, is considerably less expensive than an editor.
Whether you choose to hire a professional proofreader is a personal and
financial decision. But remember, your book always benefits from having
another pair of eyes review it carefully before it goes to press. Using your
copy editor for this job can work (and save you money), but proofreading
does require a slightly different skill set than editing.
195
Chapter 13: Working Successfully with Any Printer

Wrapping Up Your Work with a Printer
The process of having your book published is almost complete. After you
turn over your book to the printer, you can expect to receive printed copies
of your book usually within five to ten business days. When you review the
final books, check them carefully to make sure that the printer has done his
job correctly. Was the correct cover and paper stock used? Was the binding
done correctly? Is the quality of the overall work up to par and of profes-
sional quality?
If there’s a problem with the print job, you need to contact the printer
directly to discuss a remedy. If the problem was caused by an error on your
part, chances are you’ll have to pay to have the problem fixed. If the error
was on the printer’s part, the printer should take full financial responsibility
for correcting the error, even if the books have to be reprinted. 
If the books you receive from the printer are ready for sale, you’re in excel-
lent shape. Make sure that the printer keeps copies of your files so you can
order additional copies of your book quickly. Ideally, reordering your book at
this point (if you used an offset printer) should require little more than a
phone call.
Now that you have printed books in hand, you’re officially a published
author! Congratulations! It’s now your job as a self-published author to start
selling and promoting your book heavily in order to generate sales.

F
or the self-published author, your book’s listing on online booksellers
like Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) and Barnes & Noble.com
(www.barnesandnoble.com) may be your primary outlet for nationwide
distribution. When your book lacks national retail distribution, making it
available on Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com is extremely important for
generating sales. Also, when you’re doing an interview with the media or
telling people about where to obtain a copy of your book, it’s easy to say, “It’s
now available on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, or from my Web site,
www.[booktitle.com].com.”
This chapter is all about how to generate sales and positive reviews by
having your book listed with popular online booksellers. I focus on how to
create the best possible listings for your book in order to capture the atten-
tion of potential readers and describe other ways to promote your book to
online booksellers.
Another online option is selling your book through your own promotional
Web site; see Chapter 21 for more details.

Creating an Effective Listing
The listing for your book on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, or any other
online bookseller site is an opportunity for you to sell your book to potential
readers. In essence, you create a digital brochure. The more informative and
sales oriented your listing is, the better chance you have of getting someone
to click the Buy Now icon to purchase your book.
The major online booksellers have literally hundreds of thousands, perhaps
millions of book listings. While all contain basic bibliographic data, you have
the ability to expand on the book’s listing information and greatly improve
your chances of getting your book noticed and selling it on these online ser-
vices. In the following sections, I show you essential details to include in a
listing and tips for writing a listing sure to capture readers’ attention.
Excellent elements to include in a listing
When you create your book’s listing for Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble.com,
you’re required to include basic information such as the book’s full title, the
author’s name, publisher information, the price, the ISBN, the page count,
and the trim size. You also want to provide a detailed description of the book
that’s sales oriented and some information about the author.
Your listing on an online bookseller should provide all the information a
potential reader needs to convince him to purchase your book online, right
on the spot. My book The Bachelor’s Guide to Life (iUniverse) is a self-published
book. However, based on the listing on Amazon.com’s Web site in Figure 14-1,
the average reader wouldn’t know it. The book’s listing is just like a listing
you’d find for a book published by a major publishing house.
Creating an effective listing and providing additional information about your
book, beyond what’s required, help generate interest in your book. Some of
the information you should consider adding to your book’s listing includes
 A detailed description of your book: This info should be well written
and contain all the information someone wants to know about the book.
The materials you create as part of your book’s press kit (see Chapter
18) and your book’s back cover copy (see Chapter 9) can be utilized.
 An author bio: Providing information about the author helps establish
the book’s credibility and promote the author as an expert in the field. If
it’s allowed, also include an author photo within the listing. See Chapter
18 for more about author bios and photos.
 The book’s front and back cover image: You created the book cover to
be a marketing and sales tool for your book. Your book cover should
help entice potential readers to buy your book.
200
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

 Additional images from the book (if possible): Providing additional
images or graphics from your book can be beneficial if you want to offer
a bigger preview of what the reader can expect.
 Your book’s Table of Contents: Providing a Table of Contents allows you
to convey exactly what information is included and the order it’s pre-
sented in.
 A sample chapter from your book (or at least six to ten pages):
Providing a sample chapter is one way to capture potential readers’
attention and draw them into what your book offers. This material is
particularly useful for fiction; however, it can be used effectively for
almost any type of book.
 Excerpts of published reviews about your book: You, as the author,
think that your book is fantastic. But potential readers are more apt to
trust professional and well-known book reviewers, journalists, and
reporters. After your book begins receiving positive publicity, offer
excerpts from these good reviews and editorial coverage.
 “Message from the Author” and/or “Message from the Publisher”:
Some popular online booksellers allow the author and/or publisher to
post information targeted directly to potential readers within the listing.

Chapter 14: Selling Your Book through Popular Online Booksellers

Many potential readers find your book on Amazon.com’s or Barnes &
Noble.com’s Web site by doing a search based on subject matter, topic, or
category. Therefore, it’s important that you categorize your book correctly
with online booksellers and create a description and related content that
makes it easy for someone to find your book, based on keyword, category,
subject, author’s name, and/or title searches.
Terrific tactics for writing a listing
As you write your listing, keep your book’s target audience in mind and be
sure to include information that those readers will be interested in. Focus on
what’s new or innovative about your book. What sets your book apart from
the competition? Why should someone read it? The following sections offer
detailed advice on how to write a creative, high-impact, and sales-oriented
listing for your book.
Target all types of readers and Web surfers
Create a listing that caters to the masses because online services are used by
several types of readers:
 People who know what they want: These folks go online type in the
exact title or ISBN to find it and then order it online. (These people don’t
bother to read the listing because they already know what they want.)
It’s important that the book’s title, ISBN, author, and book cover image
be accurate and up-to-date, so you don’t confuse the reader.
 People who browse by subject matter: When someone enters a subject
or topic as a search phrase as they’re using Amazon.com or Barnes &
Noble.com’s Web site, a handful of book titles and descriptions are dis-
played. Browsers know they want a book on a specific topic, but they
haven’t yet selected a specific title. In this moment, your chance to sell
your book to this potential reader has increased, so by creating a well-
written and informative listing, your book may be set apart from the
competition.
 People who have heard about your book: If someone has heard about
your book, his interest may be piqued and now he wants to know more.
Naturally, today, most people would look up the information online. Your
listing should be able to transform their casual interest into a sale.
 People who search for topics of interest: These people know they want
to order a book, but they haven’t necessarily selected a topic or specific
book title. They’re browsers. When they find something they want, they
order it. Your book listing should engage these people and get them
interested in your book.
202
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

Avoid babbling
You want to create an informative, comprehensive, and well-written listing for
your book, but you must remember that the attention span of Web surfers is
extremely short. Keep your listing as concise as possible, but make sure that
it targets your book’s potential audience.
Within the description of your book, not only should you focus on what the
book includes and who it’s written for, but also describe what makes it
unique and how the reader benefits from reading it. Why should someone
read your book and not another book covering the same topic?
Use a creative, upbeat writing style when writing the listing for your book.
Offer the reader a preview of what to expect and get them excited about the
prospect of buying and reading your book. This type of content appears on
your book’s back cover (Chapter 9 has cover details).
As you begin to create a listing to appear on Amazon.com’s or Barnes &
Noble.com’s site, spend time browsing these services. Look at the listings for
current bestsellers, as well as for books more directly related to your subject
matter. Determine what approach works best and generate ideas for your
own listing (but don’t plagiarize other people’s words or listing content).
Submitting Your Listing to Popular
Online Booksellers
In many cases, after your book receives its ISBN, is registered with the Bowker’s
BooksInPrint.com directory, and is made available through one or more of the
major book distributors (such as Ingram or Baker & Taylor), obtaining a basic
listing on the sites of Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com is easy and in
some cases automatic. (See Chapter 7 for more about obtaining an ISBN and
registering with Bowker’s. See Chapter 15 for details about how to sell your
book to major distributors that automatically get their inventory listed with
the popular online booksellers.)
Depending on the self-publishing method you use, you may be considered the
author, not the publisher. For example, if you use Trafford, iUniverse, or one
of the other popular Print-On-Demand (POD) publishers (see Chapter 11),
that company would be considered the book’s publisher. Therefore, the com-
pany should obtain a listing for your book with Amazon.com and Barnes &
Noble.com. After the listing is created, however, as the author, you can fully
customize it. See “Creating an Effective Listing,” earlier in this chapter, for
ideas on how to create a listing that makes the most impact.
203
Chapter 14: Selling Your Book through Popular Online Booksellers

If you’re both the author and the publisher (because you used a traditional
offset printer; see Chapter 10), establishing a listing for your book probably
will be your responsibility, unless this is a service your printer will handle on
your behalf. In the following sections, I explain how to submit a listing to
Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble.com, and other online booksellers.
Listing your book on Amazon.com
There are three main ways to get your book listed with Amazon.com:
 Join the Amazon.com Advantage program: This service allows publish-
ers to utilize Amazon.com’s service to sell and distribute their books,
music, videos, and DVDs. To participate in this service, there’s a small
annual fee (under $30) and a 55-percent sales commission on every sale.
For details about this program, visit www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/
subst/partners/direct/advantage/home.html/103-7617088-
4850247.
 Participating in Amazon.com’s Pro-Merchant Program: This program
is a method of selling a large volume of used, collectible, and remainder
books through the Amazon.com Marketplace service. For more informa-
tion, visit www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/1161308/
103-9734249-4187021.
 List your book with a major publisher: By getting your self-published
book carried by a major distributor, such as Ingram or Baker & Taylor
(see Chapter 15 for details), a listing will automatically be created on
Amazon.com. After the listing is created, as the author/publisher, you
can then edit and expand it.
For most self-publishers, this route is the most viable way of getting a
book listed with Amazom.com, especially because many turnkey pub-
lishing solutions offered to self-publishers include having the book made
available through one or more major distributors.
Listing your book with 
Barnes & Noble.com
Many turnkey self-publishing solutions include having your book listed with
Barnes & Noble.com (which you, as the author) can then customize. If you
become your own publisher, however, you need to register your publishing
company and your individual book titles with Barnes & Noble.com directly.
204
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

At the bottom of the Barnes & Noble.com main page, click Publisher and
Author Guidelines to access information about getting your book listed with
Barnes and Noble’s popular online bookseller service. The process involves
first becoming a Vendor of Record, and then submitting content about your
book electronically. In the following sections, I guide you through the phases
of submitting a listing to Barnes & Noble.com.
Having your book distributed through Barnes & Noble.com isn’t the same as
having it sold through Barnes and Noble retail stores. If you’re interested in
obtaining distribution through the company’s retail chain, visit the following
Web site: www.barnesandnobleinc.com. See Chapter 15 for additional
information on retail distribution.
Filling out the application
If you’re a self-publisher as well as an author, becoming a Vendor of Record
involves completing an extensive online questionnaire. You need to provide
details about your company, your tax ID number, and other financial informa-
tion, among other items, to show that you represent a legitimate and estab-
lished publishing company.
After completing this form, if your book is approved, you receive an order for
two copies. This process allows your book to be listed with the service and
added to Barnes & Noble.com’s inventory system. Additional orders will then
be placed, based on demand for your book.
Self-published books are considered for distribution through Barnes &
Noble.com’s site only if the books have an ISBN assigned, a cover price over
$1, and either traditional hardcover or paperback binding (see Chapter 10 for
more about binding). All books sold to Barnes & Noble.com are on a return-
able basis.
The forms and contracts you need to complete to have your book distributed
through Barnes & Noble.com are legal documents, so review them carefully
before signing and submitting them.
Submitting bibliographic information and a cover image
After being approved as a Vendor of Record, submit detailed content about
each book. This info includes bibliographic information (pertaining to the
book’s title and author), as well as merchandising data (including a detailed
description of the book, the cover image, and other information used to
create your book’s listing on Barnes & Noble.com). Information should be
submitted to Barnes & Noble.com 180 days prior to publication or as soon as
possible thereafter.
205
Chapter 14: Selling Your Book through Popular Online Booksellers

When submitting information about a new book, you must include the follow-
ing information:
 The book’s ISBN
 Title
 Author
 Publisher (If you haven’t used a turnkey publishing solution, you need to
list your own publishing company as the book’s publisher)
 Format (such as hard cover, trade paperback, eBook, and so on)
 Price
 Publication date
 BISAC Audience
 BISAC Subject (see Chapter 7 for more info about BISAC)
 Discount (offered to Barnes and Noble)
Also send a digital image of your book’s cover, in TIFF or JPEG format, at 100
to 150 dpi resolution, with the longest side of the digital image being between
75 and 2,000 pixels. A clear image of the book cover that meets the technical
guidelines of Barnes & Noble.com must be provided with each new book 
listing.
In addition to bibliographic content and the cover image, you may want to
include optional information. See “Excellent elements to include in a listing,”
earlier in this chapter, for information on gathering this optional info.
For help along the way, e-mail the following contacts:
 Submit your content information via e-mail to titles@bn.com.
 If you have questions about submitting a new book listing, send them via
e-mail to PublisherAuthorInquiry@book.com.
 To update your book’s listing after it’s been posted online, e-mail
changes to corrections@barnesandnoble.com, and be sure to refer-
ence the book’s title and ISBN.
Approaching other online booksellers
Literally hundreds of other online booksellers are smaller than Amazon.com
and Barnes & Noble.com but can help you sell your book to its intended 
206
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

audience. Each online bookseller has its own criteria for getting your self-
published book listed and made available for sale on the service. Visit each
online bookseller’s Web site and follow the links for author or publisher sub-
mission guidelines. Two sample online booksellers are
 Books-A-Million.com (www.booksamillion.com)
 Zooba (www.zooba.com)
Generating Excellent Online Reviews
Although having your book reviewed in the New York Times or any other
newspaper or magazine definitely helps generate interest and sales for your
book, many readers rely on other readers to help them make book selections.
Many popular online booksellers allow people to write reviews of any book
and give the book a rating (one to five stars). In addition to displaying all
reviews written for each title, a cumulative average score is displayed with
each listing. So, even if a potential reader doesn’t spend the time reading all
of the posted reviews, in a matter of seconds, anyone can glance at a book’s
average rating and determine how other people liked the book. Would you
buy a book that’s received an average rating of two stars, when a competing
book has an average rating of five stars?
Having a handful of good reviews attached to your book’s listing with
Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com helps establish your book’s credibility
and works as a very powerful sales tool. After all, many people rely on what
other readers have to say, in addition to reading the promotional description
and hype you’ve included about your book as part of the listing (see
“Creating an Effective Listing,” earlier in this chapter, for details).
In the following sections, I give you the scoop on having folks you know post
reviews and reviewing other books yourself so you can get noticed.
Asking others to post reviews
As soon as your listing appears with Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com,
have a few close friends, relatives, or coworkers who’ve read your book post
a positive review with both online booksellers. The more positive reviews
you generate, the better. Just make sure that the reviews posted by people
you know are believable and not too over-the-top. (Oh, and while you’re at it,
feel free to post a five-star, incredibly positive review for Self-Publishing For
Dummies on both Amazon.com’s and Barnes & Noble.com’s Web sites!)
207
Chapter 14: Selling Your Book through Popular Online Booksellers

Relying on strangers to post positive reviews about your book is an honor-
able thing to do, but most readers are more apt to invest their time in writing
bad reviews about books they feel somehow ripped them off. Unfortunately,
motivating people to write reviews about books they’ve really enjoyed is
harder than getting people to trash your book online.
Becoming a reviewer yourself
While people are busy reviewing your book and hopefully making your book’s
listing with Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com more impressive, as an
author, you can also post reviews of other books that your target audience
may also be interested in. In other words, you can review your competition
and utilize their book listings to promote your book. Readers who visit your
competition may be compelled to visit your book’s listing and choose your
book over others. How to do it? Keep reading!
Within your reviews for other books, position yourself as an expert in your
field and as an author, and mention the title of your book. For example, say,
“As the author of [insert book title], I’ve read and reviewed many books on
this topic. This one offers . . .” Just make sure that the reviews you write are
accurate, honest, and not too promotional when discussing your own book.
Always maintain your professionalism and be courteous to your fellow
authors.
Taking Advantage of Other Resources
from Online Booksellers
In addition to creating a well-written and comprehensive listing for your
book, consider utilizing as many of the other tools and resources available to
authors and publishers on the popular online booksellers’ Web sites as possi-
ble. I cover a sampling of them in the following sections.

Distributing Your Book through
Traditional Channels
In This Chapter
 Understanding the challenges of major retail distribution

 Partnering with independent booksellers and specialty retail outlets
 Dealing with direct mail marketing and distribution
 Targeting trade associations and other niche groups
 Trying your luck with mass-market retailers and bookstore chains
T
his chapter focuses on how to obtain traditional distribution for your
self-published book. It describes some of the hurdles you face and ways
to potentially overcome them. I would love to say that self-publishing offers
all the benefits and profit potential as having your book published by a major
publishing house and that self-publishing has no drawbacks whatsoever. But,
unfortunately, that’s not the case. Although self-publishing is a viable and
potentially lucrative publishing option, its biggest drawback is the challenges
you face in trying to obtain traditional retail distribution for your book.
There is some good news though, so don’t lose heart. With a bit of work and
salesmanship, you should be able to get your book into some independently
owned bookstores and specialty retail stores. You can try your hand at distri-
bution through direct mail and niche groups like trade associations. Plus, 
by working through a major wholesaler or distributor, any bookstore could
potentially order your book for a customer, even if the store doesn’t stock it
on its shelves.

The Challenges of Securing Major Retail
Distribution for a Self-Published Book
Self-publishers can face a variety of challenges when attempting to obtain dis-
tribution through retail bookstores, especially the major chains. Here are a
few of those hurdles:
 Buying on credit: Major publishing houses, distributors, and whole-
salers offer bookstores credit terms (up to 90 days) when orders are
placed. When you use most self-publishing solutions, orders must be
paid for in advance. To overcome this obstacle, you need to inventory
your own books at your expense, but that means laying out the money
needed, shipping the books to the bookseller with industry-standard
credit terms, and waiting to be paid. Unfortunately, as the author, if
you’re buying your books at 40 to 50 percent off the cover price, this 
discount is the same you offer to booksellers. Therefore, at best, you’d
break even on the sale or earn a five to ten percent profit but tie up 
your money for up to three months in the process.
 Accepting returns: Major publishing houses accept returns on unsold
books. Unless you’re establishing your own publishing company (see
Chapter 6 for more about this task) and handling your own printing,
warehousing, and distribution, returns aren’t typically accepted by 
companies offering self-publishing solutions. Again, as a self-published
author, you could inventory your own books, and then take on the risk
that you’d receive returns 30, 60, or 90 days later.
 Lacking a sales team: Major publishers have sales teams with established
relationships with key buyers at the major distributors, wholesalers, and
bookstore chains. As a self-publisher, you can overcome this obstacle by
hiring an independent trade salesperson with industry connections (see
“Grabbing the Attention of Mass-Market Retailers and Bookstore Chains,”
later in this chapter for details on doing this). However, for this to work,
you also need to overcome the previous two obstacles.
There are a few independent trade sales reps that work with self-
published authors with only one or two titles, but finding one capable 
of selling your book, especially if the topic is niche-oriented, can be a 
challenge.
 Having a single title to sell: Major publishers offer multiple titles at
once. Most buyers are extremely busy and won’t focus their time on
evaluating and purchasing just one book title from a small publisher. The
way around this obstacle is to hire an independent trade salesperson
who sells a handful of titles simultaneously from several small publish-
ers. But, you first need to overcome all the previous obstacles
described.
212
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

Don’t count on retail distribution to achieve sales success for your book. You
need to use some or all the other sales and distribution methods discussed in
the rest of this chapter to sell large quantities of your book. I also cover other
ways to sell plenty of books and earn a respectable profit from those sales
elsewhere in this book:
 Selling books through the major online booksellers, including
Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com (see Chapter 14)
 Selling your book through your own Web site (see Chapter 21)
 Selling your book at author appearances, book signings, lectures, semi-
nars, and workshops (see Chapters 19 and 22)
After you achieve some level of success, if you still have your heart set on
being able to visit a bookstore anywhere in the country to see your book dis-
played on the shelf, consider selling your book to a major publishing house;
head to Chapter 17 for more details on this option. And you can always try
contacting national chains directly; check out “Grabbing the Attention of
Mass-Market Retailers and Bookstore Chains,” later in this chapter for more
information.
Working with Wholesalers 
and Distributors
As far as self-publishers are concerned wholesalers and distributors are
pretty much the same. (The two terms are used interchangeably.) The easiest
way to get your book into retail stores is to make it available through one or
more of the major wholesalers and distributors that already have established
relationships with key retailers. Each distributor, however, has different crite-
ria for choosing publishers to work with and actual book titles to inventory
and sell.
If you’re working with a well-established Print-On-Demand (POD) publisher
(see Chapter 11 for POD details), that company may already have an estab-
lished relationship with one or more of the major distributors. If not, you
need to contact the distributors yourself. In the following sections, I intro-
duce the major distributors that you can work with.
For help obtaining retail distribution and getting the attention of a major dis-
tributor, consider joining PMA, The Independent Book Publishers Association.
This organization offers a wide range of educational programs and resources
for self-published authors and small publishing houses. Through the organiza-
tion’s targeted publications, you can advertise your book to thousands of
booksellers nationwide. Membership is about $110 per year. Find out more
information by calling (310) 372-2732 or by visiting www.pma-online.org.

Chapter 15: Distributing Your Book through Traditional Channels

Baker & Taylor
For over 176 years, Baker & Taylor has been a pioneer in the book publishing
industry. It’s now one of the largest book distributors in the nation and a sup-
plier to virtually all the United States’ leading booksellers and libraries.
One of the company’s representatives is able to help you set up an account
and introduce you to the services offered by this company. The key benefit to
working with Baker & Taylor is that virtually all bookstores, libraries, and
other retail outlets that sell books have an established relationship with
them. After your book is listed with Baker & Taylor, booksellers can easily
order your book. Visit Baker & Taylor online at www.btol.com or give them
a call at (800) 775-1800.
Ingram Book Company
Ingram Book Company is the industry’s other largest book distributor in the
United States. Typically, Ingram only works directly with publishers offering
more than ten book titles, so self-published authors need to work with estab-
lished companies to meet their needs. So your books are carried by one of
the largest wholesalers in the world while your operations, costs, and other
publishing risks are minimized, Ingram has established a relationship with
each of the following companies:
 Publishers Marketing Association (PMA): PMA is a trade organization
that tries to advance the professional interests of independent publish-
ers Visit www.pma-online.org to stay informed about their dynamic
industry.
 Lightning Source: This company is one of Ingram’s subsidiaries and is a
POD Publisher. Check them out online at www.lightningsource.com
or call (615) 213-5815.
 Biblio Distribution: Biblio formed in 2001 to represent books published
by small trade publishers by offering warehousing, distribution, sales,
and other operation services. Contact Biblio at (800) 462-6420 or
www.bibliodistribution.com/distribution.
 Greenleaf Book Group LLC: This group offers nationwide distribution
and comprehensive production and supply marketing services. Call
(800) 932-5420 or visit www.greenleafbookgroup.com.

Other major distributors
Even if you can’t get the attention of Ingram or Baker & Taylor, many smaller
book distributors are capable of handling your book and getting it into book-
stores. Some of the other well-established book distributors include

 Wilson & Associates: Phone (281) 388-0196; Web site www.wilson

Many of the above distributors consider representing a book published by
using POD, but you may have to agree to have a pre-determined inventory of
books on hand. These terms can be negotiated with the distributor after
interest is expressed in your book. If you use a traditional offset printer to
publish your book, these companies definitely consider working with you,
assuming you meet their requirements.
For more information, contact any of the above distributors and be prepared
to submit a complete package that includes
 A published copy of your book (or galleys)
 A detailed description of the book, as well as your marketing materials
(see Part V for more about marketing and advertising)
215
Chapter 15: Distributing Your Book through Traditional Channels

 Copies of published reviews and media coverage
 A description of your marketing, advertising, and public relations plans
 Information about the author
 Retail and potential wholesale pricing (see Chapter 7 for more about
pricing your book)
Approaching Independent Booksellers
Independent booksellers typically have their own in-house buyers (often the
owner or manager of the store) and welcome the opportunity to work with
small and independent publishers in order to offer a selection of books that
their competitors don’t (those competitors are the major bookstore chains).
Working with independent booksellers offers the self-publisher an opportu-
nity to break into traditional retail stores. After you demonstrate strong sales
through a handful of independent retailers, you have an easier time selling
the rights to your book to a major publishing house, if this is your goal. It
also provides another distribution method for selling copies of your book,
especially if you can support the independent booksellers in your area by
making author appearances or participating in a book signing.
Contacting these booksellers could prove to be a time consuming process
that generates relatively few book sales. Independent bookstores each have
to be approached separately from a sales standpoint, and each typically
orders only a small number of books at a time. Many self-publishers discover
they can better utilize their time and financial resources by selling books
directly to consumers or focusing on using public relations and marketing to
get consumers to purchase their book from an online bookseller (see Chapter
14 for details on online booksellers).
In the following sections, I explain how to create a sell sheet and give you
pointers on contacting independent booksellers around the country.
Creating a sell sheet
The best way to sell to independent booksellers is to offer them credit terms
and accept returns, and then target them with a direct mail piece that adver-
tises your book. This piece, called a sell sheet, is a sales tool for your book.
Major publishing companies create one-page sell sheets for each of their
titles, so you should do this as well if you plan to sell directly to booksellers.
Your sell sheet should be easy-to-read, visually appealing, professional look-
ing, and convince bookstore buyers and other retailers to purchase, inven-
tory, and sell your book.
216
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

Because you may only have one title to offer, you could create a single-page
sell sheet, preferably using four-color printing on glossy paper, which can be
distributed to buyers and used as a sales tool. To create an outstanding sell
sheet, check out the following tips:
 Prominently display your book’s title, cover image, and bibliographic
information, which includes
• ISBN
• Cover price
• Page count
• Trim size
• Author
• Publisher
• BISAC Subject/Audience information
 Include a short but detailed description of your book, along with its
target audience in addition to the bibliographic information. You can use
the same description that appears on your book’s back cover. See
Chapter 9 for details on back cover descriptions.
 Mention if the book is available through a major distributor, so book-
sellers know they can easily place an order for the book through the dis-
tributor it already has a relationship with. (See “Working with Wholesalers
and Distributors,” earlier in this chapter for more information.)
 Include any useful facts or statistics (in bulleted format is fine) that may
help the sale of your book to booksellers. The list can include such info
as the size of the potential audience or the industry your book targets.
 Include a short author bio and author photo (see Chapter 18 for more
about author bios and photos).
 Design your sell sheet on your computer with software like Microsoft
Publisher, QuarkXPress or Adobe InDesign CS2, or hire a professional
graphic designer to create it for you (Chapter 8 has tips on finding a
graphic designer).
 Print the sheet in full-color at a local print shop or search for a company
online. The price of printing 1,000 full-color sell sheets on glossy paper
may be around $600. A much less expensive option is to print the sell
sheet in black and white, but this option looks less professional. The
major publishing houses typically use full-color sell sheets, which indus-
try people receive. Because you’re competing with books published by
major publishing houses, maintain a high-quality image.
217
Chapter 15: Distributing Your Book through Traditional Channels

Contacting independent booksellers
There are a variety of ways to contact independent booksellers across the
country. Using one of the following directories may save you considerable
time as you build your mailing list and pinpoint the booksellers you want to
target with your sales efforts. In the following sections, I give you a few help-
ful resources for finding and contacting independent booksellers.
The American Booksellers Association’s Web site
You can purchase a mailing list of independent booksellers and contact 
the buyer(s) separately to sell your books. The American Booksellers
Association’s (ABA) Web site offers an online directory of over 2,200 book-
sellers. The list can also be rented and made available on labels. Check out
the site at www.bookweb.org/bookstores.
Book Sense
Several times per month, the American Booksellers Association publishes
Book Sense — a newsletter that’s distributed to more than 1,000 key buyers
at independent booksellers nationwide. As a self-published author you want
to list your book in this newsletter prior to its publication for an excellent
way to announce the book to key industry buyers. (There is a $100 charge
per title for this service.)
To find out how to obtain a listing in Book Sense and potentially receive 
additional editorial coverage, visit www.bookweb.org/booksense/
publisher/3311.html.
For a book listing to be considered for publication, the information must be
provided in a very specific format, which is outlined on the organization’s
Web site. Be sure to include the book’s full title, author, publisher, ISBN, cover
price, type of book (hardcover, trade paperback, and so on), publication
date, and subject category. This information should be followed by a two-
sentence (50-word maximum) description of the book, along with your 
contact e-mail address.
Additional advertising opportunities are available in Book Sense and other
ABA publications, which are a cost effective ways of reaching buyers and
decision makers at bookstores.
Because a Book Sense listing appears prior to the book’s publication, the ABA
recommends that self-published authors offer buyers and booksellers a free
copy of the book’s galleys (at the buyer’s request) to review.
218
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

The Independent Publishers Group
The Independent Publishers Group (IPG) is an organization with an estab-
lished book sales and marketing team that works with a small number of self-
published authors and small publishers each year to help them establish
national distribution through retail booksellers. This organization does more
than simply act as a distributor; it also helps the self-published author
market and promote a title using proven methods.
IPG charges a commission (based on sales) for its services. You can reach the
company at (312) 337-0747 or hop online at www.ipgbook.com.
PMA, the Independent Book Publishers Association
PMA, the Independent Book Publishers Association, offers a “Trade
Distribution Acceptance Program” that can help self-publishers market 
and distribute their book. You can reach the group at (310) 372-2732 or 
visit www.pma-online.org.
Scoping Out Specialty Retail Stores
Specialty retail outlets can include any retail store that isn’t a traditional
bookstore but that sells a small number of book titles. For example, indepen-
dently owned gift shops and boutiques often sell books, while retail chains
like Urban Outfitters sell novelty books that cater to its young and hip demo-
graphic. The Discovery Store is another example of a retail chain that sells a
small number of books that cater to its customers.
Other specialty retailers that sell books (usually on specific topics of interest
to its customers) include Best Buy, Staples, OfficeMax, Office Depot, Toys “R”
Us, Newbury Comics, CompUSA, PETCO, PetSmart, and General Nutrition
Centers (GNC).
This type of distribution strategy is ideal for books that focus on a niche-
oriented topic. The advantage to pursuing specialty retail shops as a dist-
ribution outlet is that you could potentially increase awareness and sales
opportunities for your book. The drawback is that as a self-published author
working alone, getting through to the appropriate buyer and getting their
attention could be a challenge.
The process of selling your books through specialty retail stores is very
much the same as selling to independent booksellers (see the previous sec-
tion). You need to contact the appropriate buyer at the retail store or chain.
You may find that hiring an experienced salesperson is helpful so you can
219
Chapter 15: Distributing Your Book through Traditional Channels

establish connections and have some assistance in the sales process. See
“Grabbing the Attention of Mass-Market Retailers and Bookstore Chains,”
later in this chapter for the scoop on finding such a person.
You may need to allow specialty retail stores to buy on credit but not to
return unsold books. These stores expect to buy the book in quantity at 
40 to 60 percent off the cover price.
Distributing Your Book via Direct Mail
Another way to distribute your book is to focus on reaching your book’s
target audience by sending a direct mail piece. Direct mail pieces need to be
well-written and create an incentive that the reader can’t refuse. The mailer
should also establish urgency, so the reader responds to your offer immedi-
ately. And don’t forget: Your direct mail piece needs an order form for recipi-
ents to order copies of your book directly from you (providing a toll-free
phone number or Web site can increase your chances of getting a response
even more). Make sure that your order form requests all the information you
need to process someone’s order, including the buyer’s name, address, phone
number, payment information, shipping address, and so on. See Chapter 16
for more information on order fulfillment.
Your direct mail piece can be a powerful sales tool for your book. You only
have a few seconds to capture the attention of the potential reader, so make
sure that your mailer, whether it’s a sales letter, brochure, or sell sheet (see
“Creating a sell sheet” earlier in this chapter), piques the readers’ curiosity.
After you’ve prepared your mailer, you need somewhere to send it, right?
Using direct mail is most useful when you’re targeting a very niche market.
You can figure out who to send your piece to by purchasing a custom-tailored
mailing list comprised of people you believe may be interested in your book.
How to do it? Rent a targeted mailing list from a special interest group, trade
association, or special interest magazine publisher that also targets your
intended readers. You should also use a mailing list of your established cus-
tomers or clients, if available.
Because of the costs associated with renting a mailing list and then printing
and mailing brochures and sales literature (varies from a fraction of a cent
per name up to several dollars per name), make sure to target your audience
and ensure that the cover price of your book (and your profit from each copy
sold) can justify this expense. When using direct mail, a response rate of only
11⁄2 to 2 percent is considered normal.
220
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

Before investing a lot in direct mail marketing and distribution, find out more
about this opportunity from other sources:
 The Direct Marketing Association is one excellent resource that’s avail-
able online at www.the-dma.org.
 The National Mail Order Association is another organization that offers
educational resources online to help small businesses learn direct mail
techniques and strategies. Visit www.nmoa.com or call (612) 788-1673.
 If you want to give creating your own pieces a shot, pick up Writing Copy
For Dummies (Wiley) by Jonathan Kranz.
Looking for less expensive options that directly target potential readers? Try
the following:
 Utilize opt-in e-mail lists and targeted e-mail (which is very different
from sending spam). See Chapter 21 for tips on using the Internet as a
marketing tool for your book.
 Do some research and team up with a company that uses direct mail to
sell its products or services and bundle your book mailing in with theirs.
Offer a special discount to people who buy the product/service and your
book.
Hooking Up with Trade Associations,
Special Interest Groups, and Conferences
Many professional trade associations, special interest groups, and trade
show/ conference planners sell books and educational materials to its mem-
bers. As part of your market research (see Chapter 7 for more info), pinpoint
groups and associations whose membership may be interested in selling your
book, and then contact those groups directly. Consider offering a special dis-
count to members or allowing the organization to publish excerpts from your
book (for free) on their Web site in order to generate interest and sales.
In reality, any company, organization or group that sells books or that’s set
up to sell products at retail to customers, clients, or members, could poten-
tially sell your book. The trick to making this happen is helping the decision
makers at these organizations realize how selling your book can potentially
benefit everyone involved and generate a profit, too. Your book’s press kit
and marketing materials, combined with telephone calls to key decision mar-
kets should do the trick. In some cases, offering these organizations a special
discount on high-quantity orders can be enticing.
221
Chapter 15: Distributing Your Book through Traditional Channels

If your book caters to people working in a specific industry or who gather for
an industry or consumer-oriented trade show, consider renting booth space
at these trade shows or conferences and selling your book directly to atten-
dees and participants. Offering attendees a special discount and an auto-
graphed copy of the book are excellent sales incentives. But be sure that you
can fit such expenses into your overall budget (see Chapter 6 for details).
Grabbing the Attention of Mass-Market
Retailers and Bookstore Chains
For self-published authors and small publishers, breaking into the mass-
market retailers or into major bookstore chains is extremely challenging.
Realistically, you shouldn’t expect to obtain this type of distribution for your
self-published book. Getting the attention of a buyer who represents a major
bookstore chain or mass-market retailer requires a lot more than you being a
good writer. Major publishing houses have entire sales departments whose
job involves cultivating relationships with these buyers.
222

Now showing . . .
Industry-oriented and consumer trade shows
are held throughout the world that focus on
many different industries and interests. These
gatherings bring together professionals work-
ing in an industry from all over the world. They
allow for the exchange of information, provide
a valuable learning opportunity, and offer excel-
lent networking opportunities. When attending
a trade show, bring plenty of press kits and mar-
keting materials for your book to hand out for
networking.
Many trade shows occur each year. One of the
biggest industry trades shows is Book Expo
America. Booksellers, buyers, major publishing
houses, authors, distributors, wholesalers, 
the media, and a wide range of other people
working in the book publishing industry attend
this show, held annually in a different city each
year. If you’re looking for distribution, attending
this trade show and perhaps renting a small
booth to showcase your book could be benefi-
cial. For details, visit the trade show’s Web site

To properly sell your book to the appropriate decision makers, you need to
be highly professional, knowledgeable about the publishing industry, busi-
ness savvy, persistent, and willing to dedicate the time, energy, and resources
needed. You definitely need to step up and play in the big leagues, so to
speak. Start your selling process early-on, because getting the attention of a
buyer can take weeks or months. An alternative is to wait for your book to
become successful, and then approach the appropriate buyers with proof
that there’s a huge potential market for your book. So here are a few things 
to get you to the plate:
 Hire an experienced sales representative who has established connec-
tions with buyers associated with the mass-market retailers and book-
store chains. Many sales representatives work with a handful of authors
and small publishers simultaneously. Even though you have to pay for
the services of a sales representative, your chances of having your book
seen and evaluated by important buyers improve greatly if you hire the
right person. The sales rep you hire should have experience working
with the key buyers you want to target and have a good understanding
of your book and who it targets. A successful sales rep has pre-established
relationships with buyers that you benefit from.
 Team up with the manufacturer or distributor of an established prod-
uct that already has mass-market distribution and bundle your book
with that product. This maneuver requires approaching and negotiating
with a company that offers a product of interest to the same target audi-
ence as your book. To do this, contact the sales or marketing depart-
ment of the company whose product you’d like to bundle your book
with. You need to pitch the idea and probably want to follow up with a
written proposal outlining your plan and ideas.
Of course, you can contact the book buyers who represent the various mass-
market retailers yourself. Contact the company’s corporate offices and ask
who the appropriate buyer is. Then, send that buyer a copy of your book and
related sales materials. Keep in mind that you need to offer the mass market
retailers and bookstore chains credit terms, plus a significant discount off the
book’s cover price (up to 60 percent), if they become interested in placing an
order and selling your book.
Try contacting the following mass-market retailers
 Wal-Mart: To approach Wal-Mart, call Anderson Merchandisers at (800)
999-0904. This company exclusively distributes books, magazines, video,
and audio products to Wal-Mart. To have your book evaluated for possi-
ble sale through Wal-Mart stores, send the following info:
• A copy of your book
• Sales materials (your book’s press kit and marketing materials)
223
Chapter 15: Distributing Your Book through Traditional Channels

Address: Anderson Merchandisers, Attn: Marketing Dept. – New Title
Solicitation, 421 South East 34th Avenue, Amarillo, TX 79103.
 Barnes & Noble Retail Bookstores: Self-published authors or small pub-
lishers can try to have their books distributed through Barnes & Noble’s
chain of retail bookstores. Barnes & Noble Retail Bookstores doesn’t
give preference to books sold through wholesalers like Borders does.
Here is the info to send:
• A published copy of your book
• Marketing and promotional plans
• Trade reviews
• Information about what makes the book unique
Address: The Small Press Department, Barnes & Noble, Inc., 122 Fifth
Avenue, New York, NY 10011.
Barnes & Noble.com is different than the company’s chain of retail
stores. See Chapter 14 for information on selling your book through pop-
ular online booksellers.
 Borders Group: Borders Group, Inc. is the parent company of Borders
bookstores and Waldenbooks, two national chains of retail booksellers.
To have your book considered for possible sale through these retail
chains, send
• A copy of your published book
• Marketing and promotional plans
• Trade reviews
• Details about your distribution channel
• A description of your book
Address: New Vendor Acquisitions, Borders Group, Inc., 100 Phoenix
Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48108.
The review process takes approximately 90 days. Borders Group reports
that having your book available from one of the popular book distribu-
tors greatly increases your chances of being considered for distribution
through its retailers. See “Working with Wholesalers and Distributors,”
earlier in this chapter for more information.

Getting a Grip on Warehousing,
Order Fulfillment, and Shipping
In This Chapter
 Storing and taking inventory of your books
 Taking and fulfilling orders
 Sending your books to customers
I
n many cases authors can reap financial rewards for selling their own
books directly. These sales allow authors to increase earning potentials on
each copy sold. But this potential does come with a little bit of work. You
have to set up your own operation for warehousing, order taking, fulfillment,
and shipping. Many self-published authors do these processes from their
homes. This chapter helps you create your procedures.
After you begin selling books, whether directly to customers or to booksellers
or retailers, you need to establish some type of formal business (mainly for
tax purposes). Chapter 6 helps you set up your publishing business.
Here are a few ideas to ease you into the entire warehousing, fulfillment, and
shipping process:
 Figure out the least expensive way to ship books. Research prices
through the United States Postal Service, FedEx, UPS, and DHL.
 Purchase the appropriate shipping supplies, so you have everything
on hand. This stock includes envelopes, packing tape, mailing labels,
postage, and so on. You want to be able to fill and ship orders quickly
and in an organized manner.
 Hire a company to handle everything for you. The company takes care
of accepting telephone and online orders to warehousing your books,
processing orders, and handling the necessary accounting and customer
management. Hiring a company can get expensive and quickly eat away

your profits, so check with your printer to see if it handles these ser-
vices. You also can do an online search for order processing or order ful-
fillment companies or obtain a referral from an industry association’s
Web site, such as PMA, the Independent Book Publishers Association
(www.pma-online.org).
Warehousing Your Books 
and Managing Inventory
Selling your own books requires maintaining an inventory (warehousing
books) to fill orders. In the following sections, I explain the importance of
safely storing your books and carefully monitoring your inventory.
Storing your books safely
If you use offset printing (see Chapter 10 for details) to publish a large quan-
tity of books, you wind up with a bunch of large cartons filled with books 
that need to be warehoused. If you use Print-On-Demand (POD) (covered in
Chapter 11), you can keep a much smaller quantity of books on-hand and
reorder more as needed.
Many self-published authors use their basement, garage, or attic to store
their book inventory. This storage is convenient if you plan to sell books
directly to readers, booksellers, or retailers and wish to work from home.
Check out these important tips for keeping books in excellent condition:
 Keep the books in a climate-controlled, clean, and dry environment.
 Store cartons on pallets (a few inches above the ground), especially if
you’re storing boxes in your basement and you have flooding issues.
 Pack the books in large, sealable plastic containers to ensure that they
stay clean and dry until they’re sold and ready to be shipped.
 Consider running a dehumidifier in your storage room if the room is
damp because exposure to water or moisture quickly damages the
books to the point where they’re unsuitable for sale.
 Purchase additional insurance to protect your inventory against damage
or theft, especially if you’re storing a large quantity of inventory within
your home; this inventory is for a business, so your homeowner’s or
renter’s insurance policy may not cover it (contact your insurance com-
pany for more information).
226
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

If you don’t have a basement or attic available, another option for warehous-
ing large quantities of books is to rent space from a self-storage facility in
your area. The cost for this space is about $30 to $50 per month. Make sure
that the storage facility is climate controlled and that you store the books in
airtight and waterproof containers for their protection. You may also need to
acquire special insurance if you use a storage facility.
Taking stock of your inventory
A wise business operator regularly maintains a good grasp of the inventory
levels. You need to establish a simple way to handle inventory control so you
always know how many books you have on hand. Monitoring inventory also
means being able to anticipate demand and pre-ordering additional inventory
at the appropriate time so it’s available when you need it. If you’re selling just
one product — your book — you can calculate inventory levels by hand.
Keeping detailed invoices also helps with this process.
After you begin selling a significant number of books, consider investing in
some basic inventory management software for your computer. Some
turnkey eCommerce Web site solutions have built-in inventory management
tools. Quicken Premiere Home and Business 2006 is an excellent software
package for managing many aspects of your small, home-based business
operations and finances. For more info on this program, visit
www.quicken.com.
Handling Order Taking and Fulfillment
Depending on how you plan to sell your books, your order taking and fulfill-
ment operations may be different:
 You may sell your books in person at a variety of events.
 Some authors advertise their books in print publications, on the radio,
or through a direct mail campaign, so establish a toll-free phone number
to accept orders.
 You may want to create an eCommerce Web site to accept orders online.
 Set yourself up to accept orders by mail and obtain a P.O. Box (for your
privacy) and then display the mail order address in your ads (see Part V
for more on advertising).
As orders are received or sales are made, document them promptly and fulfill
the orders ASAP. Make sure to process payments, manage a database of cus-
tomers, and print invoices, too. I cover all these processes and more in the
following sections.
227
Chapter 16: Getting a Grip on Warehousing, Order Fulfillment, and Shipping

Whatever methods you use to accept orders and interact with customers, the
service and professionalism you offer to those people need to be top notch.
When you begin selling books directly to customers, whether those cus-
tomers are booksellers or individual readers, those people expect to be doing
business with an established company. You can easily run this company from
your home on a part-time basis as long as customers are able to easily place
orders and those orders are promptly processed and shipped. This process
requires you to establish carefully thought out procedures for all aspects of
the ordering process.
Offering different order options
There are many ways to sell your books, such as in person, via mail order,
through an 800 number, and through your own Web site. The following sec-
tions offer some additional detail about these various options.
Taking orders in person
If you sell books in person at author appearances, seminars, trade shows,
and other events, be prepared. Bring a generous supply of books (so you
don’t run out) and a small table or trade show display to sell the books from
(if the vendor doesn’t supply a table). Be ready to accept cash, check, debit
card, or credit card payments. Along with the payments, generate simple
receipts for customers with a duplicate copy of the receipt for your own
records.
Accepting checks can be a problem, because checks bounce, causing you to
lose money on the sale. You don’t want to waste the time or money involved
in tracking down the lost sales of bad checks. If you’re willing to take the
financial risk, accept checks. Otherwise, accept other forms of payment.
Selling books in person allows people to meet you and purchase the book
right on the spot, without having to place and wait for an order. People often
prefer the instant gratification of obtaining what they purchase right away.
Working with mail orders
Some customers may prefer to send their orders through the mail. If that is
the case, then you need to be prepared. Here are a few tips:
 Include an order form that people can fax or mail as a viable way to sell
books.
 Offer a printable order form on your Web site for people unwilling to
make online purchases.
 List an address in print ads to encourage orders by mail.
228
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

When accepting forms of payment through the mail, you can take all forms, but
remember that checks can cause you big headaches. It’s best not to accept
checks, especially on small ticket items like books. It’s not worth the risk.
Establishing a toll-free phone number
Establishing an incoming toll-free number to accept orders is easy. The toll-
free number can be programmed to ring on your existing home, cell, or office
phone. To order your own toll-free number, call your local phone company or
a long distance telephone service provider.
The following list is a small sampling of companies that offer inexpensive,
incoming, toll-free service:
 Freedom Voice Systems: Rates start at 4.5 cents per minute, plus a low
monthly fee. A variety of extra features and services, such as voicemail
and call forwarding, are included. Call (800) 605-9858 or visit
www.xtreme800.biz.
 RingCentral: Rates start at 3.9 cents per minute with a low monthly fee.
Service includes voicemail, call forwarding, and other useful features.
Reach the company at (800) 574-5290 or visit their Web site at
www.ringcentral.com.
 Smart800: Rates start at 4.9 cents per minute, plus a small monthly fee.
A variety of extra features and services, such as voicemail and call for-
warding, are included. Phone (877) 357-0757; Web site www.smart800
now.com.
 TollFreeNumber.org: Rates start at 3 cents per minute with a low
monthly fee. Service includes voicemail, call forwarding, and other
useful features. Call (800) 951-9411 for more info or go online at
www.tollfreenumber.org.
Having a toll-free number means that you pay by the minute for each incom-
ing call, so if you’re on the phone for five minutes with each customer, the
cost of that call needs to be built into your cost of doing business and the
cost of goods sold (and subtracted from your potential profit). See Chapter 6
for more about working with a budget.
After you have a toll-free phone number set up for people to call and place
their orders, have someone well trained on hand to answer the phone during
business hours. If someone calls to place an order, you could lose the sale if
that caller hears your voicemail instead of a live person.
If you’re not available to answer your incoming calls, hire a non-automated
answering service capable of order taking. Be prepared to write a script for
the people answering the phone, so they know what to say, how to describe
your book, and how to gather the information you need to process orders.
You typically pay for a service by the call. Some also charge a monthly fee.
You can find answering services listed online or in the Yellow Pages.

Chapter 16: Getting a Grip on Warehousing, Order Fulfillment, and Shipping

Launching an eCommerce Web site
An eCommerce Web site is slightly different from a regular Web site because
it’s equipped with a shopping cart module that allows someone to place a
secure order online using a major credit card or PayPal. Adding a shopping
cart to a Web site or creating a simple eCommerce Web site for your book is
relatively easy and inexpensive.
Many turnkey companies offer easy-to-use eCommerce Web site creating and
hosting tools, for as little as $10 per month. These companies include
 Yahoo! Small Business: sbs.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/merchant
 ProStores: www.prostores.com
 GoDaddy.com: www.godaddy.com/gdshop/ecommerce/cart.asp
These turnkey eCommerce solutions also help you set up a merchant
account so you can accept credit card payments online. The beauty of these
solutions is that all of the tools are available online and absolutely no pro-
gramming knowledge is required to create and operate the site.
For help creating an effective eCommerce Web site to sell books online, read
my book The Unofficial Guide to Starting a Business Online, 2nd Edition
(Wiley), or check out E-Commerce For Dummies (Wiley) by Don Jones, Mark
D. Scott, and Richard Villars. You can find additional information about build-
ing a Web site for your book in Chapter 21.
Accepting payments
Selling books, whether in person or online, requires you to be able to accept
different forms of payment in order to generate the most possible sales and
offer convenience to your customers. To accept credit card payments, you
can establish a merchant account. You also can accept payments via PayPal,
cash, and checks. I cover all these options in the following sections.
You may accept most payments by credit card. When you sell books in
person, you can, of course, also accept cash and checks. However, many
people prefer the convenience of making purchases using their credit or
debit card. When selling online, accepting cash isn’t an option and few people
take the time to mail in a check or money order if they’re shopping online.
Opening a merchant account for credit card payments
To accept credit cards, you first need to establish a merchant account through
a bank, a financial institution, or a merchant account service provider. After
credit card payments are authorized, either manually or automatically
(through your eCommerce Web site), the funds are transferred directly into
your bank account within one to three business days.
230
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

Typically, establishing a merchant account requires a one-time set-up fee and
an ongoing monthly fee. You also need to pay a small service charge on each
sale made. Depending on the volume of business you’re doing, you can shop
around for the lowest fees.
Here are a few strategies for setting up a merchant account and finding the
best deals available from banks or merchant account providers:
 Before shopping around, estimate your anticipated number of
monthly transactions and sales volume. If you have a small number of
high volume sales (to booksellers or distributors, for example), your
ideal fee structure may be different than if you’re processing many
smaller transactions and selling individual copies of your book.
 Compare prices and beware of hidden fees. The majority of merchant
accounts charge a percentage of the volume processed. This term is
called the discount rate.
 Ask about rate review policies. After you establish a working relation-
ship with a merchant bank, request a reduction in your discount rate
after several months. Even a small reduction in your discount rate saves
you money in the long run.
 Read all the contracts and agreements carefully! Make sure that you
understand the terms of the contract, including how long the contract is
in effect and what all the fees are. You can even hire a lawyer to review
the contracts before you sign them.
 Make sure that the merchant account you sign up for allows you to
accept orders online but also make in-person sales, if those are your
plans. The merchant account should be able to work seamlessly with
your eCommerce Web site.
To find merchant account service providers and compare rates, use any
Internet search engine, such as Yahoo! or Google. Enter the search phrase
merchant account. If you’re using a turnkey solution for your eCommerce Web
site (covered earlier in this chapter), the service provider often offers mer-
chant account services (for an additional fee). Here’s a small list of merchant
account service providers:
 Card Service International: Phone (888) 869-5520; Web site www.
csicard.com
 Credit Merchant Account Services: Phone (203) 483-5751; Web site
www.merchantaccount.net
 Merchant Account Company: (800) 956-1990; Web site www.merchant
account.com
 Merchant Accounts Express: (888) 845-9457; Web site www.merchant
express.com
231
Chapter 16: Getting a Grip on Warehousing, Order Fulfillment, and Shipping

Using PayPal
PayPal was created to be a safe, convenient, and easy way for people to make
purchases online. It’s another option you can offer as a safe way to accept
payments from your customers. PayPal offers merchants a variety of differ-
ent, low-cost services, which are especially attractive to small business oper-
ators. Best of all, as a merchant, you can set up your account and begin
receiving PayPal payments in a matter of minutes. Funds from sales are trans-
mitted to your bank account instantly.
The main drawback to PayPal is that for someone to use it to make a pay-
ment, he must be a PayPal member, unless you establish your merchant
account through PayPal. After someone has an established PayPal account,
he can make purchases using a major credit card, debit card, or checking
account number. Consumers can also maintain funds in their account for 
purchases.
For more information, visit the PayPal Web site at www.paypal.com and
click the Merchant Tools tab at the top of the screen.
Taking care with cash
If you’re going to accept cash, especially at busy events, make sure that you
have a cash register or cash box that remains safe, especially if you get dis-
tracted. As the author, if you’re interacting with potential readers, signing
books, and answering questions, have someone else nearby actually handling
the money and selling your books for you.
It’s also important to write out receipts for customers who pay with cash.
Make sure that you have a duplicate copy for your records. If customers 
have questions or complaints later, you have a copy of the receipt to settle
disputes.
Checking out checks
Accepting personal checks is risky. It’s easy for someone to bounce a check
or put a stop payment on the check. If this happens, you not only lose the
purchase price of the book, but also you’re charged an extra fee by your bank
or financial institution. As you get started selling books, you may want to
offer this as a payment option, but ultimately, you’re better off accepting
cash, PayPal payments, and debit or credit cards. If you’re going to accept a
check, get the buyer’s information (address, phone number, driver’s license
number, and so on.) The problem is, for the value of the check (the cover
price of your book), it’s probably not worth pursuing if it bounces.
232
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

Doing the paperwork
Every business requires its operators to handle a variety of different types of
paperwork to track customers, record orders, process those orders, and
manage finances. Proper recordkeeping is essential.
To handle much of your recordkeeping and paperwork, you can use a com-
prehensive, vertical market software application designed for mail-order
businesses, off-the-shelf contact management and accounting software, or
online tools provided by the eCommerce Internet Service Provider (ISP) you
opt to work with (I cover eCommerce Web sites earlier in this chapter).
These online tools help you manage customer records and the paperwork
associated with all aspects of order fulfillment. Of course, you can always do
your recordkeeping the old-fashioned way — using paper, pencil, and a calcu-
lator, if you’re not technologically savvy.
ACT! is a powerful contact management software application available from
Sage Software that allows you to keep track of customers, print shipping
labels, and generate personalized invoices and correspondence with ease.
Check out the product online at www.act.com.
The following types of information you handle most when doing paperwork:
 Orders: Maintain a detailed list of all incoming book orders. You can use
a database program, spreadsheet, or hard copy files.
 Customer database: Maintaining a database of your customers is
extremely helpful, especially if you plan to publish additional books in
the future or want to sell these same customers additional products or
services. Having order information at your fingertips is helpful and
important. For each customer, make sure that you have a full name,
address, phone number, ordering details, method of payment and its
details, and the way you shipped the product.
 Sales receipts: A sales receipt is issued to the customer when a sale is
made, typically in a retail or in-person environment. It’s a good idea to
keep a copy of your sales receipts for recordkeeping purposes and to be
able to track orders.
 Invoices: An invoice can be used as a sales receipt or it can be created if
you’re shipping books to customers and receiving payment later.
Whether you use invoices or sales receipts depends on how and where
you sell your books.
 Returns: Keeping track of returns helps you maintain accurate inventory
records and manage your finances. It’s faster and easier to keep track of
returns with inventory-management or mail-order-management software.
233
Chapter 16: Getting a Grip on Warehousing, Order Fulfillment, and Shipping

Because you’re running a business, doing the appropriate paperwork and
filing tax returns as needed keeps you out of trouble with the IRS and helps
you better manage your finances, track profits and expenditures, and gener-
ate the most revenue possible from your publishing venture. Hiring a book-
keeper to manage your day-to-day paperwork may be helpful. An accountant
can also help you set up procedures for handling this paperwork, but having
these people do all of the recordkeeping for you can get costly, so maybe take
a class or two on financial management.
Shipping Your Books to Customers
Setting your publishing company up to accept orders and sell books also
includes having the ability to ship orders to customers, whether it’s 100
books to a distributor, ten books to a bookseller, or one book to a customer.
In the following sections, I give you the basics on shipping rates and supplies.
Surveying shipping rates
When it comes to shipping books to customers, you have a variety of
options. The service you use should depend on your budget and how quickly
you need your books to arrive at their destinations. Overnight couriers like
FedEx are going to be much more expensive than First-Class or Priority Mail
from the U.S. Postal Service. However, if you absolutely, positively need to get
your book someplace overnight, FedEx or another overnight courier is the
way to go. For most self-published authors, the book rate from the post office
or a standard ground service from a courier is an inexpensive, viable option.
The United States Postal Service
The United States Postal Service (USPS) offers a variety of services for mer-
chants to ship their goods. You can order stamps and shipping supplies
online (www.usps.com) and find out about the following shipping methods:
 Priority Mail: The USPS offers free envelopes for flat-rate Priority Mail,
and the postage for the envelopes starts at $4.05 per package. Priority
Mail typically takes two to three business days (including Saturday) for
delivery.
 First-Class Mail: First-Class Mail is a bit cheaper than Priority Mail, but
you have to pay for the envelope. First Class mail can take one to five
business days to be delivered.
234
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

 Book Rate or Media Mail: This method is the cheapest shipping method
from the USPS. When you use Book Rate shipping, a one-pound package
costs around $1.59 to ship.
Book Rate does dramatically slow down how long it takes for your ship-
ments to arrive at their destination. Book Rate can take up to ten days or
longer for delivery.
If you’re filling a large number of orders (and I hope you do!), consider rent-
ing a postage machine and buying a postage scale. A postage machine can
help you keep accurate records of your postage expenditures and also
reduce trips to the Post Office to purchase stamps. Here are some options:
 Pitney Bowes offers a variety of different postage machine options. Visit
www.pb.com for more info.
 Stamps.com allows you to purchase and print postage from your com-
puter and printer. Visit www.stamps.com.
Major shipping companies
For larger shipments or overnight shipments, consider establishing an
account with a major shipping company:
 DHL: Phone (800) CALL-DHL; Web site www.dhl-usa.com
 FedEx: Phone (800) GO-FEDEX; Web site www.fedex.com
 UPS: Phone (800) PICK-UPS; Web site www.ups.com
These accounts can be set up by using a major credit card by visiting any of
these couriers’ Web sites. After an account is set up, you can print shipping
labels and schedule pick ups from your computer.
Setting up your shipping department
To save time and money, stock up on shipping supplies in order to promptly
fill orders. Necessary supplies include
 Bubble wrap or packing peanuts
 Invoices
 Packing tape
 Padded envelopes
 Scissors
235
Chapter 16: Getting a Grip on Warehousing, Order Fulfillment, and Shipping

 Shipping labels
 Small boxes
 Stamps or a postage machine
To stock up on shipping supplies, visit your local office supply superstore, or
check out other shipping supply suppliers online. Your options include
 Boxes.com: www.boxes.com
 Bubble Fast: www.bubblefast.com
 Go Packaging: www.gopackaging.com
 Office Depot: www.officedepot.com
 OfficeMax: www.officemax.com
 Packaging Supplies: www.packagingsupplies.com
 PaperMart: www.papermart.com
 Staples: www.staples.com
 Uline: www.uline.com
 VeriPack: www.veripack.com
Make sure that your packages don’t arrive damaged. Either use an appropri-
ate size envelope, a padded envelope, or wrap the book in bubble wrap. Your
customers will be happier and your business won’t suffer from shipping dam-
aged goods.

Selling Your Book to the Big Boys
for Better Distribution
In This Chapter
 Selling your book to a major publisher
 Wading into the international market
 Selling subsidiary and serial rights
S
elf-publishing certainly has its benefits, especially for unproven, previ-
ously unpublished authors or established writers who are able to market
directly to people interested in the topic they’re writing about. One of the
biggest drawbacks to self-publishing, however, is the difficulty you face trying
to obtain national distribution.
Selling your self-published book to a major publishing house offers multiple
advantages. You can also sell your book in foreign countries or negotiate the
subsidiary and serial rights for wider distribution, as you see in this chapter.
Sending Your Book to a Major Publisher
Suppose you’re an author who’s already pursued self-publishing, achieved
some success, and is now looking to improve distribution and sales of your
book by working with a major publishing house. In the following sections, I
show you the benefits of working with a major publisher and smart methods
for approaching one. I also explain basic types of publishing deals and tell
you how to handle potential rejections.
The book publishing industry is competitive. Even if a major publisher
decides to publish and distribute your book, you may not receive the full sup-
port of the company’s sales, marketing, public relations, and advertising
departments. So, while your book could reach booksellers’ shelves, unless
you take an active role in promoting it as the author, it may not receive the
support it needs. It may make sense to invest more money in marketing or
establish better distribution and continue your self-publishing efforts.

Understanding how a major 
publisher can help you
A major publisher can offer a wide range of resources you probably don’t
have as a self-published author. These resources include
 A team of editors and creative people who can help redesign and
enhance your book’s interior and cover
 Established relationships with printers
 An experienced sales and marketing team with existing relationships
with buyers representing major bookstore chains nationwide, as well as
libraries, independent booksellers, distributors, and wholesalers
 A team of public relations specialists who can create and implement a
comprehensive campaign for your book
 A marketing and advertising team capable of properly reaching your
book’s target audience on a national level
 Warehousing and distribution facilities
 An accounting department that tracks sales, handles all finances relating
to the book, and distributes author royalties accordingly
You give up significant control over your book working with a major pub-
lisher, and you earn a significantly lower royalty on every copy of the book
sold. But with the resources of a major publisher behind you, you can enjoy
the following benefits:
 You may sell many more copies of your book than you would as a self-
published author.
 The publisher takes on all of the financial responsibilities relating to
designing, printing, distributing, selling, and marketing your book.
After spending between $5,000 and $20,000 (or more) to have your book self-
published initially, you could be paid an advance upfront by the publisher
who buys your book.
Approaching a major publisher
You want to grab the attention of the major publishing houses, right? You’ve
already self-published your book; you’ve received a handful of favorable
reviews and some positive media coverage; and you can show respectable
sales for the title based on the distribution and resources you’ve had at your
disposal. You may now be able to accomplish your goal. In the following sec-
tions, I give you tips on hiring a literary agent, researching potential publish-
ers, and crafting a proposal to get your book in front of the big boys.

Chapter 17: Selling Your Book to the Big Boys for Better Distribution
Having a literary agent represent you
The first step to approaching a publisher is to find an established literary
agent who really believes in your project and helps you sell the idea to pub-
lishers. Many major publishing houses work only with authors represented
by literary agents. A literary agent is someone who’s experienced working in
the book publishing industry, who’s established contacts with publishers,
and who represents you and your book ideas to those publishers. A literary
agent earns between 15 and 20 percent of your earnings, based on the
advance, royalties, and/or licensing fees paid by the publisher.
A literary agent helps you
 Prepare and fine-tune your proposal for a publisher: This proposal is
your sales packet that introduces yourself to the publisher and gets
them excited to learn about your book. Focus on benefits to the publish-
ing house. Why should they publish your book? (I cover proposals later
in this chapter.)
 Represent your book by contacting publishers on your behalf: A
respected agent will often be able to get your proposal read by publish-
ers that would otherwise ignore submissions from self-published or
inexperienced writers.
 Negotiate a deal (and related contracts) with a publisher that’s inter-
ested in your book: Whenever an author and a publisher work together,
a detailed, legal contract must be written and signed by both parties.
This contract outlines the terms of the deal and describes the exact
responsibilities of the author and the publisher. (I cover publishing
deals later in this chapter.)
Looking for a literary agent? Check out the 2006 Guide to Literary Agents
(Writer’s Digest Books). The book is an annual directory listing more than 600
established literary agents; it includes detailed information about the types
of clients each agency represents and how to make contact with them.
Look for an agent who specializes in the type of book you’ve written and who
has contacts with the major publishing houses that may be interested in your
project. An agent must agree to represent you, but you also must decide if
the agent’s experience, qualifications, contacts, and publishing knowledge
will help you get your book published by a major publishing house.
Even though it’s not critical to have an agent, unless you’re familiar with how
the publishing industry works and have your own connections with execu-
tives (editors and publishers) at major publishing houses, you may want to
work with a literary agent when trying to sell your book.
Researching potential publishers
You can contact the publishing houses yourself without using a literary agent,
but first, do some research to pinpoint a handful of publishers that specialize

in the type of book you’re hoping to get published. When approaching larger
publishers, you need to contact the subsidiary or imprint within the company
that’s most appropriate. (Many publishers have subsidiaries or imprints that
are smaller divisions specializing in specific types of books. For example, a
major publisher may have a fiction imprint, a nonfiction imprint, a business
books imprint, a children’s book imprint, and even a cookbook imprint.)
Even if you’re using an agent, you can do research to determine which pub-
lishers may be interested in your book. This lets you have an intelligent con-
versation with your agent about his approach to selling your book.
Two popular directories list details about book publishers.
 Writer’s Market (Writer’s Digest Books): This directory is published
annually. It offers a comprehensive list of 4,000 potential markets for
writers, including book publishers. Each listing describes the types of
books a publisher specializes in, along with relevant contact information
and submission guidelines.
 Jeff Herman’s Guide to Book Publishers, Editors, & Literary Agents
(Three Dogs Press): This annual directory is available in bookstores.
After you’ve created a list of potential publishers to target, determine who the
acquisitions editor is at each publishing company, subsidiary, and/or imprint.
This person is your ultimate contact. Initiate contact by making a telephone
call to the acquisitions editor. During this call, introduce yourself, describe
your book in 30 seconds or less, and determine if there’s a potential interest. If
so, follow up by sending a full proposal. If you have an agent representing you,
he’s responsible for making contact with the publisher on your behalf.
Creating a winning proposal
Even though you already have copies of your self-published book in your
hands, you still need to develop a detailed proposal. If you’re working with a
literary agent, he helps you fine-tune your proposal and customize it for each
publisher you’re submitting to. This proposal should include the following:
 A detailed description of your book (one or two pages), including what
it’s about and information about what the book contains
 An explanation about what sets your book apart from the competition
 A detailed outline of the book (several pages long), including a chapter-
by-chapter summary
 A summary, including quantitative and qualitative facts, figures, or sta-
tistics, of the book’s target audience, including its size
 Your biography, including information about what makes you an expert
on the topic you’ve written and your related experience
 A copy of your self-published book, along with copies of reviews and
press coverage you’ve received
240
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

241
Chapter 17: Selling Your Book to the Big Boys for Better Distribution
Each proposal should be accompanied by a well-written, attention-getting
cover letter that’s specifically addressed to the acquisitions editor at the
publisher. As much as possible, customize the cover letter and proposal to
each individual publisher. This letter should be typed and printed in a formal
business letter format. You want to make the best first impression possible
with this letter, so what it says and the way it looks are equally important.
Most publishers receive dozens, perhaps hundreds, of proposals every week.
Your proposal must be professional and fall within the editorial scope of what
the publisher typically publishes. It needs to stand out and demonstrate that
there’s a need and viable market for your book on a national scale.
Examining different publishing deals
Just as there are thousands of publishers, as well as imprints and subsidiaries
within those publishers, there are many types of publishing deals that can be
structured. If you’re working with a literary agent, he can help you evaluate
and negotiate the best deal possible. The four most common scenarios are
 The publisher pays a one-time, flat fee for the manuscript and becomes
the sole copyright owner of the material. You provide the manuscript on
a work-for-hire basis.
 The publisher pays a licensing fee to print copies of your self-published
book.
 The publisher pays an advance, plus royalties on all copies of the book
sold. This means you’d receive money upfront and ongoing royalty 
payments based on sales of your book. The advance is usually fully
recoupable from future sales. (When you receive an advance, that
money is deducted from your initial book sales. Think of your advance
as a loan against your future income. If, however, your book doesn’t sell
enough copies to pay back the advance, you don’t have to refund the
money out of your pocket.)
 The publisher pays royalties only, based on sales.
The advance or royalty you can expect from a publisher varies greatly. Many
publishers base the advance it offers to the author on anticipated first-year
sales. Depending on the size of the publisher and a variety of other factors, a
book advance could be anywhere from $5,000 to $25,000 or more. The per-
centage of royalties paid also varies greatly but is typically something that
can be negotiated with the publisher.
Before signing your contract with the publisher, have your literary agent
carefully review it. If you’re not working with an agent, hire a lawyer to review
the contract to ensure that your interests are protected. Contracts written by
major publishers vary greatly. Some protect the author’s interest more than

others, but all of them always protect the publisher’s legal, business, and
financial interests. Make sure that you understand all the terms within the
contract and know your responsibilities.
If you make a deal with a publisher, you give up significant control over the
project as a whole. Ultimately, the publisher needs to approve all content
within the book. The publisher also has final say over the book’s interior and
cover design, how the book is marketed, and how much of its resources get
put behind your book. In some cases, you don’t even get consulted when cer-
tain decisions are made. Your primary obligation is simply to submit a manu-
script that adheres to the outline pre-approved by the publisher.
“Sorry, not interested”: Handling rejection
Getting your book published by a major company is a competitive process.
Publishers are becoming much more careful about the projects they publish
and how resources are allocated. Unless you’re a celebrity, a well-known busi-
ness leader, a juror in a high-profile trial, or a recognized expert in your field
and there’s a potentially large market for your book, capturing the attention
of a publisher, especially a large publisher, is going to be difficult.
With that said, though, being able to submit a self-published copy of your
book with your proposal when contacting a publisher certainly gives you
some added credibility. But remember that no matter how good your self-
published book really is and how professional your proposal comes across,
not all publishers jump at what you’re offering. So, expect some rejection
when you submit your proposal to publishers.
With rejection comes perseverance (that’s perseverance on your part).
Submit your proposal to multiple publishers you believe might be interested
in your project, and never take rejection personally. In most cases, you either
never hear back from the publisher (implying that they’re not interested) or
you receive a short rejection letter. Don’t give up!
If you happen to speak with an acquisitions editor who ultimately rejects your
book, ask her why she made the decision and what could be done to improve
the proposal or book. Use whatever feedback you can get constructively, keep-
ing in mind that the rejection is based upon someone’s opinion. However, you
probably don’t want to make a follow-up call to the editor after you receive a
rejection. This could make you look unprofessional or desperate. One alterna-
tive is to write a short, friendly e-mail to the editor. You’re better off having
your agent call on your behalf if you’re looking for constructive feedback.
After you submit your proposal to a publisher, be patient! The decision can
take weeks or months and that includes your proposal reaching the top of an
acquisitions editor’s stack of proposals. Then, if the editor likes the project, a
publishing company’s editorial board and sales department still must often
approve the idea.

Meet a literary agent
Jeff Herman is the president of the Jeff Herman
Agency (Web site: www.jeffherman.com).
He’s represented authors as a literary agent since
1987 and is responsible for helping to bring more
than 500 books into print. He’s also the author of
Jeff Herman’s Guide to Book Publishers, Editors,
& Literary Agents (Three Dog Press) and Write
the Perfect Book Proposal (Wiley).
Herman has worked with many first-time authors.
For someone interested in getting a book pub-
lished, he recommends using a literary agent but
stresses the importance of finding the right agent.
“Most literary agencies are mom-and-pop busi-
nesses that employ less than 10 people. Each
agent is individually quirky and has his own taste
and preferences. An agent who’s successful is by
definition someone who’s very selective about the
authors and projects he chooses to represent. So
most agents, including myself, wind up rejecting
over 90 percent of the proposals we see. An agent
builds up his credibility with publishers by care-
fully screening projects and only pitching viable
books. If an agent loses his credibility, he loses
access to publishers, which renders him ineffec-
tive as an agent,” explains Herman.
When a self-published author approaches a
respectable literary agent, Herman explains that
in most situations, the agent and most publishers
treat that book as a previously unpublished work,
because most self-published books don’t have
bookstore distribution. “A self-published book is
just like an unpublished book from my perspec-
tive as an agent. Major publishers are focused
on selling books to the booksellers. So, if a self-
published book has never been distributed
through bookstores, even if it’s sold a million
copies, as far as the publisher is concerned, it’s
an unpublished book,” says Herman.
A self-published author can benefit from using a
literary agent in the same way as any other
author. Herman says, “I look at what the self-
published book can do moving forward. If the
book has already sold 5,000 copies, I ask right
away if it could potentially sell an additional
5,000 copies if a publisher comes on board or if
the market for the book is already tapped out.
The literary agent takes the self-published book
and helps the author create a proposal package
for potential publishers, and then the agent uses
his connections to get the book seen by deci-
sion makers at the publishing companies. An
agent can never guarantee that a book will be
acquired by a publisher. An agent can guaran-
tee that the book is seen by decision makers at
major publishing companies.”
For someone looking to work with a literary
agent, Herman explains that the author should
never have to pay a reading fee to the agent.
“No reputable literary agent charges an author
a fee to read a proposal or manuscript. An agent
earns money by selling books to publishers and
collecting commissions,” he added. “Having a
self-published book doesn’t put you at a disad-
vantage when trying to sell a project to a pub-
lisher. You’d be surprised how many current
bestsellers started out as self-published books.
If as a self-published author you plan to con-
tinue to sell copies of your own book, be sure to
negotiate for the ability to purchase copies of
your book at a significant discount if you begin
working with a publisher. This agreement allows
you to continue earning a good margin on the
books you sell yourself, but you can rely on the
publisher to do what you couldn’t do yourself,
which is to get your book into the bookstores.”

Even if a publisher rejects your book, you can still resubmit it six months (or
more) later. Often, the publisher’s focus changes, based on trends and how the
publishing industry is doing. There’s also a high rate of turnover among acqui-
sitions editors and other decision makers at many publishing companies.
Tapping the International Market
Some books have sales potential not just in the United States but also in one
or more countries throughout the world. Having your book sold overseas
may require that it be translated into other languages. However, if the con-
tent of your book is of interest to readers in other countries, tapping the
international market could become an extremely viable revenue stream. In
the following sections, I give you an overview of licensing your book to for-
eign publishers and selling your self-published book directly overseas.
Licensing your book to foreign publishers
Many major publishing houses (as well as self-publishers) have found success
in tapping the international market by contacting overseas publishers and
offering them an exclusive licensing arrangement. In exchange for licensing
fees (or an advance, plus royalties), the overseas publisher obtains the rights
to publish, market, and distribute your book in the territories it does business
in. The overseas publisher also incurs the cost of translating your book into
other languages, if applicable. This method probably is the most cost-effective
and easiest way to obtain international distribution for your book.
A literary agent helps you determine if your book has international appeal
and then makes contact with overseas publishers and negotiates publishing
and distribution deals on your behalf. See “Having a literary agent represent
you” earlier in this chapter for more about finding an agent.
Directly selling your book overseas
Just as you’ve developed a distribution channel for your self-published book
in the United States and kicked off marketing, advertising, and public rela-
tions campaigns for it (see Part V for details), you can do the same things in
other countries. This process, however, requires a strong knowledge about
how business in done in each country you want to directly sell your book in,
and you need to develop local business contacts within those countries.
Another potential difficulty with selling your book directly to readers over-
seas is printing, shipping, and inventory. One option is to work with a Print-
On-Demand (POD) publisher in each country or region where you believe
244
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 

245
Chapter 17: Selling Your Book to the Big Boys for Better Distribution
there’s a viable market for your book (see Chapter 11 for more about POD).
You also can sell your book to international wholesalers and distributors (see
Chapter 15 for general info on wholesalers and distributors).
Amazon.com, for example, has several subsidiaries in various countries:
 Canada (www.amazon.ca)
 The United Kingdom (www.amazon.co.uk)
 Germany (www.amazon.de)
 Japan (www.amazon.co.jp)
 France (www.amazon.fr)
 China (www.joyo.com)
After your book releases, you can list it with online booksellers in foreign
markets. See Chapter 14 for more information about online booksellers.
Selling the Subsidiary or Serial 
Rights to Your Book
Subsidiary rights refers to licensing or selling permission for other companies
to rework your book into various other types of products, such as videos,
movies, or television shows. The term also refers to selling rights to an over-
seas publisher or book club interested in publishing its own version or edi-
tion of your book. (See the nearby sidebar “Join the club: Generating huge
sales” for more about book clubs.)
Depending on the topic of your book, subsidiary sales and licensing can
become extremely lucrative. Hollywood often pays hundreds of thousands or
even millions of dollars for the movie or television series rights to a best-
selling work of fiction or a true story. There’s also money to be made selling
instructional DVDs and videos based on successful how-to books. Licensing
your book to an established audio book publisher also is a viable option for
self-publishers. (Head to Chapter 22 for details on creating spin-off products
from your book without selling your rights.)
Another viable revenue stream for self-publishers is through selling the serial
rights to your book to magazines, newspapers, or other publications. This
sale allows a publication to publish large portions of your book, including
excerpts, serializations, and condensations (an abridged version of your
book), in exchange for paying you a fee.

When you sell the serial rights to your book before it’s actually published and
distributed in book form, this is referred to as selling the first serial rights. If
you sell or license the rights to this material after your book has been pub-
lished, it’s referred to as selling the second serial rights. Many publications are
willing to pay more for the first serial rights because these rights give them
the ability to offer their readers an exclusive.
An experienced lawyer or a literary agent can best handle marketing, negoti-
ating, and selling the subsidiary and/or serial rights to your work.
246
Part IV: Making Your Book a Bestseller: Distribution Methods 
Join the club: Generating huge sales
Book clubs are mail order houses that allow
members to sign up and purchase books at dis-
counted rates. For example, a new member may
be able to buy six books for the price of one but
then be required to purchase two or three addi-
tional books at the book club’s normal, but dis-
counted, price sometime during the next one or
two years. Members can purchase any number
of books beyond their membership commitment
at the club’s discounted rates.
Book clubs aren’t as popular as they once were,
but if you can get a book club interested in rec-
ommending and selling your book, the interest
almost always leads to impressive sales. You
can find listings of book clubs and related con-
tact information in directories, like The Literary
Market Place (R.R. Bowker) and Writer’s
Market. The Book Club Offers’ Web site
(www.book-club-offers.com) features
an online comparison between the most popu-
lar book clubs in America.
In addition to general interest book clubs, there
are also a range of special interest book clubs
that cater to people with specific interests: mys-
tery; romance; science fiction; home improve-
ment; cooking; children’s books; books with gay,
lesbian, or transgender themes; pets; or travel.
In many cases, the book club either purchases
a large quantity of books from you or negotiates
for subsidiary rights to publish its own edition of
your book. In addition to generating sales, work-
ing with a book club is a powerful marketing
tool, because the book club promotes your book
to all of its members and perspective members.
If you’re working with an agent, allow him to
handle negotiations on your behalf.

Creating a Buzz:

In this part . . .
C
reating a buzz about your book can be done by creat-
ing and implementing highly effective and compre-
hensive public relations, marketing, and advertising
campaigns, which can be accomplished on almost any
budget. Getting your book reviewed in the media, having
feature articles written about it, obtaining guest appear-
ances on radio and television shows, and creating high-
impact advertising all help you sell books. To reach your
book’s target audience, using the Internet is also a highly
effective tool. You can even create products based on
your book’s content and topic to generate greater rev-
enues. This part focuses on how to promote your book to
the public to start selling copies!

A
dvertising and publicity do have one important difference: the impact on
your wallet. Advertising (covered in Chapter 20) can cost a pretty penny,
but generating publicity can be much less expensive. Even if you hire a public
relations (PR) firm, the cost is often less than advertising and can be much
more effective in generating book sales. Your alternative is to act as your own
publicist and begin making contacts within the media world yourself.
Generate hype for your book at least 60 days before it hits the stores or
becomes available for sale. Create excitement by developing and launching a
well-thought-out PR campaign. Although your goal may be to obtain a guest
spot on Oprah and to sell a million books overnight, more realistically, to gen-
erate positive media attention for your soon-to-be published book, contact a
wide range of media outlets such as local, regional, and national newspapers;
magazines; Web sites; and television and radio shows.
This chapter helps you prepare the publicity tools you need to begin working
with the media in a professional way. You discover how to supply reporters,
journalists, editors, and producers with the information they need, in the
format they want, within a time frame that works well to meet their deadlines.
Check out Chapter 19 for details on how to handle yourself with the media.

Going Over the Basics of Press Materials
Your success in generating publicity for your book is directly impacted by the
quality of the press materials you create. A well-written and informative press
release may pique the interest of a journalist and result in positive articles
and/or reviews. A poorly written press release may be ignored by the media
and result in no publicity. The press materials you create are used as a tool
when executing your pre-planned publicity campaign.
The PR campaign you develop needs to do the following:
 Generate positive reviews of your book in newspapers, in magazines,
and on Web sites
 Convince specific media outlets to do a feature article or segment about
you as the author of your new book (the campaign includes profiling you
as an expert on the topic you wrote about in your book)
 Help you get invited to be as a guest on radio and television talk shows
 Assist you in booking author appearances and book signings (which I
cover in Chapter 19)
In the following sections, I explain why creating press materials for your
book, listing the elements found in a traditional press kit, and covering the
importance of including a solid PR message in your materials are important.
Knowing why your book needs a press kit
A press kit is a tool that you create to educate the media about you and your
book. The items within your press kit all work together to communicate infor-
mation fast and efficiently. In a nutshell, your press kit helps you to do the 
following:
 Generate positive attention: You want to create a professional looking
press kit, which is the easiest and least expensive way to tell large num-
bers of people about your book. This kit can gain the attention of the
media. After you get attention, convince the media to feature your book
in their editorial coverage.
Most reporters are extremely busy, so the squeaky wheel gets the
grease. Reporters and the like receive dozens of press kits and story
pitches each day from people looking for publicity.
250
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

 Clearly define your message: Avoiding ambiguity may send your story
to the top of the pile. Pitch your book in a unique way that tells an
engaging story that the media wants to share with the public.
 Describe unique features of your book: Your press kit describes what’s
interesting, newsworthy, or exciting about your book and positions you
as an expert who can speak with authority on the topic of your book.
For fiction writers, your message focuses on the plot of your book, rele-
vance or timeliness it has to real world issues, and the target audience.
Surveying a press kit’s elements
Every element in your press kit complements each other in terms of content.
This process can easily be done by using the same paper color, paper stock,
font, typestyle, ink color, and overall design or color scheme for all elements.
The media wants and needs exact information for their stories, so if your
information isn’t presented properly within the press kit, it may be ignored!
Traditionally, a press kit contains the following items:
 A two-pocket presentation folder
 A one- or two-page press release about your book
 An author bio
 A photo of the author
 A business card of the author (that’s you)
 Photo copies of previous articles written about your book
 A review copy of the book or a postcard/faxback form a reporter can use
to quickly request a review copy of your book
 Promotional items (see Chapter 20), such as a bookmark, that you’ve
created to hype your book
Customizing your message
As you develop the PR campaign for your book, focus on customizing the
message you’re trying to communicate to the specific media outlets you
target. Remember who your audience is and focus on the best way to reach
them. After you’ve defined whom you’re trying to reach, focus on the best
ways to reach those people. The following sections cover some ways you can
target specific media outlets.
251
Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

Media categorized by geography and audience
Being the publicist for your own book requires you to write a customized
marketing message and pitch it to specific media outlets. These outlets need
to have an interest in covering your book. Professional publicists categorize
media outlets in a variety of different ways.
 Regional and national media: Describes the geographic coverage a
media outlet reaches
 Consumer-oriented media: Comprises newspapers, magazines, radio,
TV, and Web sites that cater to mass-market consumers
 Niche media: Includes special interest media outlets that cater to small,
but highly focused, audiences
 Industry-oriented media: Targets people working in a specific industry
As you create your message, consider specific story ideas that the various
media outlets may use. The PR message you create should be something
journalists want to share with their audience or readers. Your PR message
should quickly explain to a journalist how and why your book appeals to the
audience that the journalist reaches.
Your press kit needs to be customized for various types of media outlets:
 Print media: Focus on providing the tools needed, such as artwork of
your book’s cover, details about your book, and information (and a
photo) about the author.
 Radio or TV: Instead of including artwork in your press kit, you may
want to include sample interview questions within your press kit and a
video of past appearances you’ve made on TV shows.
Always personalize and customize your pitch letter specifically to the jour-
nalist, reporter, editor, or producer you’re sending it to.
Special tips for electronic media
Print media refers to any media outlet, such as a newsletter, newspaper, or
magazine, that’s distributed in printed form. Electronic media, on the other
hand, refers to any media outlet, such as a television station, radio station, or
Web site, that distributes content electronically.
When you’re targeting electronic media outlets, you’re typically pitching
yourself to be a guest on a specific show. The producer needs to know that
you’re knowledgeable, well-spoken, clean-cut, professional, and media savvy
enough to be an entertaining guest. The easiest way to prove your demeanor
252
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

is to provide an electronic press kit (EPK). (EPKs are discussed later in this
chapter.) In addition to the items included in the traditional press kit, an EPK
contains either audio or video clips of you appearing on other radio or televi-
sion programs. This footage allows the show’s producers, booking agents,
and hosts to determine whether you’d be a good guest on the show.
After several radio or television interviews and a handful of newspaper or
magazine features, create a printed list of where you and your book have
appeared and include this list within your press kit. An impressive list of past
media coverage showcases your credibility with other media outlets.
Making a Great Impression 
with the Press Kit Folder
All the elements of a professional press kit are typically housed in a two-pocket
presentation folder. Blank folders are available at office supply stores; however,
to establish a true professional image, have your press kit folders profession-
ally designed and printed. The custom design typically costs between $1 and
$3 per folder, with a minimum order of 500 or 1,000 units. I cover design and
cost issues to consider in the following sections.
By making the investment and having custom-printed press kit folders cre-
ated, you establish a professional image for your self-published book, your
publishing company, and for you as an author.
Design details
Almost any professional printer can work with you to design and print your
press kit folders. The best option for your press kit folder is a standard-size
folder, that nicely holds 81⁄2-x-11-inch sheets of paper. On the front cover of the
folder, you can have your book’s cover displayed. On the inside pocket flaps,
you can have your contact information and/or Web site address imprinted, or
have slits cut into the pocket flap so you can insert your business card. Discuss
these options with your printer. (See Chapter 10 for more details about working
with a traditional printer.)
If you’re the author of multiple books, create a more generic press kit folder
for you as an author instead of each individual book title (this method is
more cost effective). Imprint your name, photo, or images of multiple book
covers on the front cover of your press kit folder. Don’t just use your newest
book cover. You can also use your publishing company’s logo as artwork on
the press kit’s cover if you’re promoting multiple book titles.
253
Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

Cost considerations
Be sure to ask your printer for samples of other folders, so you get design
ideas. Some decisions that impact folder printing costs include the following:
 Paper stock and color used
 Coating or laminate added to the folder
 Single, multiple, or full-color printing
 Timeline
Regarding timeline, how quickly you need the completed folders may also
impact cost (most printers charge extra for rush service, too). And depend-
ing on the printer, delivery of the finished product can take anywhere from
five to ten (or more) business days, so plan production accordingly.
You’re likely to save money if you supply your printer with camera-ready art-
work of the images to be printed on your folders. Provide these images in
print or electronic form, but be sure to meet your printer’s guidelines.

around and top-quality custom-printed folders at highly competitive

Writing an Attention-Getting 
Press Release
The most important document within your press kit is the press release. This
one or two page release, written in a very specific format, provides the
needed facts, but in a concise way. A press release must answer the following
questions: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?
The press release also needs to convince the reporter or journalist that
you’re news is actually newsworthy. If the publication date of your book ties
into a specific event or holiday, make that information clear within the
release.
254
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

What you say in your press release and how you say it depend on the type of
book you’re publishing and the PR message you’re trying to convey.
Somewhere within your press release, include the following information:
 A catchy headline announcing the publication of your book
 A release date for the press release
 Your contact information (or the contact information of someone work-
ing with you)
 A dateline
 Title and author
 Cover price, publisher, and page count
 The target audience and why the book appeals to readers
 Specific content and what makes it unique
 One or two short quotes from the author
 One or two sentences about how and where the book can be purchased
In the following sections, I walk you through the parts of a press release and
share some winning tips for crafting your own.
The anatomy of a press release
Before you start writing your press release, focus on the message you’re
trying to convey and determine exactly who you want to receive the mes-
sage. Now, figure out how to convey the information about your book in a
catchy, up-beat, and concise way, keeping the press release to one or two
pages. (One page is the ideal length; most reporters are too busy to read 
long documents.)
Figure 18-1 is a sample press release for a self-published book. Use it as a
guideline for the proper way to write and format your book’s press release.
The headline
The headline is the first line of your press release. In one or two lines (use as
few words as possible), come up with a catchy way — through puns, statis-
tics, or statements about your book — to attract the reader’s attention.
Format the headline specifically:
 Centered at the very top of the release
 Boldface type
 14- to 16-point font
 No more than two lines and fewer than ten words, if possible

Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

The release date
Below the headline type the words for immediate release. Make sure that this
phrase is formatted as follows:
 In all caps (FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE)
 Left-justified on the page
 Boldface type
 12-point font
Contact information
The contact information lists a person, phone number, and e-mail address
and is listed under the headline (on the right side of the page), so journalists
or reporters can reach you quickly. Use the same font and type size as the
main body of the press release. Even if contact information is already on your
company’s letterhead, repeat it in the press release at the bottom of the page.
Ideally, the contact person shouldn’t be the same person as the author. You
quickly earn more credibility with journalists if you appear to have a publi-
cist. If you haven’t hired a publicist, consider listing your secretary, business
partner, spouse, or someone else as the main contact person.
Format the contact information as follows:
 Placed under the headline
 Right-justified on the page
 10-point font
 Non-boldfaced type
The dateline
Under for immediate release, skip one line and add a dateline. This line
includes the issuing city and state, followed by the date of the release. For
example: “Boston, MA — September 21, 2006”. After the date, include a dash
(—), followed by the first sentence of the press release’s lead paragraph. For
the dateline only, not the rest of the release’s text, use a specific format:
 Boldface type
 12-point font
257
Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

The lead paragraph
In the first sentence or two, you must grab the reader’s addition, while pro-
viding key information about the release of your book. This key info includes
your book’s title, author’s name, topic, publisher, audience, cover price, page
count, and other related details (like where the book is available). Generally,
don’t write more than one or two sentences. Here’s an example:
Bestselling author Jason R. Rich (www.JasonRich.com) is proud to
announce the publication of his latest book, The Bachelor’s Guide to Life
($18.95/iUniverse). This 228-page fun and informative book is jam-packed
with answers to common questions that single guys often have.
Format the lead paragraph as such:
 Left and right justified on the page (blocked)
 Non-boldface type
 12-point font
The body
The next one or two paragraphs of the press release provide details about
the new book: what sets it apart, who it targets, and why people may be inter-
ested in it. If your first paragraph doesn’t fully answer the w questions (see
“Writing an Attention-Getting Press Release” for w questions), then this is the
information you need to convey. Also be sure to include a few short quotes
and information on how to order the book.
The information in the body contains all the information you want the gen-
eral public to know about your book. Many journalists lift information from
your release and place it verbatim within their articles and reviews, so 
format your text as follows:
 Left and right justified on the page (blocked)
 Non-boldface type
 12-point font
Information about the author
This separate paragraph, titled About The Author, describes the author’s cre-
dentials and establishes him as an expert in his field. The information can
also include reasons why the author makes an interesting guest on a televi-
sion or radio talk show. This paragraph can also list the author’s Web site
address.
258
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

The final sentence of this paragraph states, “For more information, or to sched-
ule an interview with [insert author’s name], please call [phone number], visit
[Web site], or send an e-mail to [e-mail address]. Review copies are available to
the media by request.” The contact person’s full name, title, company name,
mailing address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, and Web site can
be displayed at the bottom, if room permits.
The About The Author section of the press release is formatted as a separate
paragraph within the body of the press release. The text is formatted as such:
 Left and right justified on the page (blocked)
 Non-boldface type
 12-point font
The ending
At the very end of the release, skip two or three lines and include the follow-
ing: # # #. This indicates the end of the release and no additional text follows.
Format this line of text as
 Non-boldface type
 12-point font
 Centered on the page
If your release continues to a second page, display More . . . at the bottom-
right corner of the first page and indicate at the top of the second page that
the page is page two of the release. At the top center of the second page, dis-
play a phrase like Page 2 of 2.
Tips for putting together a press release
The goal of the press release is to convey your unique PR message to a jour-
nalist in a standardized format. Although you definitely want to communicate
the relevant facts, it’s okay to tap your creativity to make your releases stand
out. Here are additional tips to help you format and create your press
releases so that they receive the attention they deserve from the media:
 Print a press release on 81⁄2-x-11-inch white paper. Use a standard one-
inch top and bottom margin and 11⁄4-inch left and right margin. Stick with
a common, easy-to-read font, such as Times New Roman, Helvetica, or
Arial. Ideally, you want to double-space the main body of the release, but
if necessary, use 11⁄2 line spacing to ensure that the text fits on one or
two pages.
259
Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

 Visit PR Newswire on the Web (www.PRNewswire.com). This Web site
is a press release distribution service. Read a handful of actual press
releases issued by companies, study each release’s formatting and con-
tent, and determine what elements of those releases can be used to help
convey your own PR message (see “Customizing your message,” earlier
in this chapter, for details).
 Hire a freelance writer or PR professional to assist you with the writ-
ing and formatting of your press release. One excellent resource for
finding skilled freelance writers is www.eLance.com. Services cost
between $100 and $500.
Using Successful Strategies 
for Writing Your Author Bio
The press release is designed to announce the publication of your book and
describe to journalists and reporters what the book is all about. The author
bio, however, needs to focus on you, the author. Describe yourself and your
professional experience, and position yourself as an expert in your field.
Format the author bio by using the following specs:
 One, 81⁄2-x-11-inch page
 Single or double-spacing
 12-point font
The author bio is also an opportunity to showcase your personality, through
the tone in which your bio is written. After reading your author bio, the media
rep will hopefully want to meet, interview, and feature you in his coverage.
Although following a certain format for your press release is vital, your
author bio can be a bit less structured, although visually, the bio needs to
complement your press release and the overall design of your press kit. 
See an example of an author bio in Figure 18-2.
The heading
Place your full name at the top of your author bio formatted as follows:
 Centered on the page
 Boldface type
 16- to 18-point font

Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

Directly under your full name, type your title or main credential. For example,
say, “Author, [Insert Book Title]” or “President and CEO of [Insert Company
Name]”. Format this information with boldface type and 14-point font.
Beneath your name and title, skip a line or two, and then add your contact
information, including your mailing address, phone number(s), fax number,
e-mail address, and Web site address. Format this section with non-boldface
type and 10- or 12-point font.
Some authors and publicists incorporate a small, black-and-white photo of
the author on the author bio page. This option isn’t mandatory but a photo is
a good idea because it helps readers see who they’re reading about and helps
them to better relate to that person. Research has proven that for radio and
TV appearances, in particular, press kits that contain an author photo gener-
ate more requests for interviews. See “Putting Your Best Face Forward with a
Publicity Photo,” later in this chapter for more details.
If you incorporate a photo into the body of this document, make sure the
photo looks professional and isn’t blurry or pixilated. Photocopying the
release dramatically detracts from the picture quality and looks amateurish.
The alternative is to include a professionally taken publicity photo within
your press kit (which is ideal).
The body
After the heading of your author bio is complete, create three or four, well-
written paragraphs that describe you, your credentials, your background and
your story. Be sure to include your PR message within this bio and use word-
ing that helps to convey your personality. Relate who you are and what you
do to the topic your book covers and focus on the relevance between the
two. What makes you the ideal person to write the book? Why should the
media outlet you’re pitching interview you? Some of the topics you may want
to address within your author bio include
 Your professional background
 Your educational background
 Information about your book
 Why you wrote your book
 How and why you became an expert in your field
 Interesting, newsworthy, or unusual info about yourself
262
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

 One or two sentences containing personal information about your
family, hobbies, interests and/or where you live (for example: “John 
Doe is a graduate of Harvard University and currently lives in Boston,
Massachusetts with his wife and two children. When not writing, he
enjoys traveling, sailing, and breeding Yorkshire Terrier puppies”)
Not all of the above information applies to every author. Keep the topic of
your book and your target audience in mind. The order in which this informa-
tion is revealed is also entirely up to you; however, the very first paragraph
needs to grab the reader’s attention and quickly summarize who you are and
why you’re an expert (and also mention your book).
For the body text of your author bio, make sure that the text looks visually
pleasing on the page (not cluttered). Use a consistent format:
 Non-boldface type
 12-point font
 Justified text (both left and right margin justification)
 11⁄2 or double line spacing
If you want a booking as a guest on a talk radio or television program, the
author bio is your best tool. The bio can persuade producers, talent bookers,
and hosts that you’d be an ideal guest for their show. If you’re chosen as a
guest, help formulate intelligent interview questions. At the end of the author
bio, many authors and publicists include a list of between five and ten sample
questions for the talk show host to ask you during an interview. By offering
these questions, along with background information about you and your
book, you’ll be providing the information interviewers need, without making
them do research or too much pre-interview preparation.
Putting Your Best Face Forward 
with a Publicity Photo
Another element of your press kit is a publicity photo of the author. Many
publications run photos of a book’s author in conjunction with reviews or
articles, but require the author or publisher to supply the photo. In the fol-
lowing sections, I discuss the look and price of your photo.
263
Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

Photo particulars
If you’re creating a traditional printed press kit, include either a 5-x-7- or 
8-x-10-inch publicity photo of yourself. Place your full name, title (such as
“Author, [insert book title]”), and contact information (at least your phone
number and e-mail address) at the bottom of the photo.
Listing your contact information multiple times throughout your packet
ensures that people can reach you. Your publicity photo is no different.
Here are some suggestions for creating an attention-getting picture:
 Have a professional photographer take your publicity photo. If you
work with any professional photographer, they’ll know exactly what to
shoot, if you specifically request that a publicity head shot be taken.
 Have a tight headshot. This shot is a close-up photo, taken of your
upper chest and head. This shot shows more detail and what the author
looks like more than a full-body shot, and the headshot is considered
standard.
 Shoot black-and-white photos. Newspapers prefer black-and-white
photos for their publications.
 Make a full-color picture. Have this variety available by request.
Magazines tend to use color images for their stories.
 Consider the tone. The publicity conveys a message about your person-
ality and the tone of the book itself. If you’re promoting a funny or
upbeat book, for instance, make sure that the publicity photo suggests
your fun and cheerful personality.
Pricing pointers
Shooting a professional looking photo can be pricy, but if you know where to
look, you may snatch up a good deal. Check out these places for a quality
photo within a reasonable price range:
 Glamour Shots
 The Picture People
 Sears
 Target
 Wal-Mart
264
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Portrait studios typically charge under $50 for a publicity photo, while
department stores also have inexpensive portrait options ($30–50). Before
you have your photograph taken, make sure you’ll own the copyright to the
photo so you can easily have it reproduced as needed, by any photo process-
ing lab. Most labs don’t duplicate photos if you don’t own the copyright.
You can check the Yellow Pages for portrait photographers in your area, but
these independent photographers often charge several hundred dollars for a
photo shoot.
At the time you have your publicity photo taken, ask to receive one 8-x-10-inch
print and a copy of the file saved in high-resolution, electronic format, either 
on a disk or CD. Save the file electronically in either a TIF or JPG format. 
This format allows you to distribute your publicity photo electronically — via
e-mail — on a CD, or via your Web site. If the photographer doesn’t provide the
photo in an electronic format, take the 8-x-10-inch print to any photo lab where
it can be scanned into a computer and saved on a disk or CD for a small fee.
Photo labs can also reproduce your photo for a small fee. Depending on the
quantity of publicity photos you need, have your photographer or a profes-
sional photo lab reproduce the photo for you. Plan on spending between $1
and $5 per 8-x-10-inch, black-and-white print if you have the photo repro-
duced at a photo lab.
An alternative to 8-x-10-inch prints is to use 5-x-7-inch prints. This option is
slightly cheaper and just as easily reproduced. Only supply color photos if
they’re in a digital format and can be easily edited (into black and white) by
the publication’s photo editor, if appropriate.
A quality photo lab is different from those one-hour photo places in super-
markets, drugstores, and mass-market retailers. Check your local Yellow
Pages for photo processing labs in your area. You can also seek a referral
from a professional photographer.
An alternative to the photo lab, especially if you need several hundred copies
of your publicity photo, is submit your master print to a national company
like ABC Pictures (Phone [888] 526-5336; Web site www.abcpictures.com).
This company specializes in reproducing more cost-effective publicity photos
for authors and actors by using a lithograph printing process. For $90 (plus
shipping), the company offers 500 8-x-10-inch, black-and-white photos, com-
plete with typesetting at the bottom. Just supply one master photo in print or
electronic form. ABC Pictures also creates full-color publicity photos by using
the lithograph printing process for less cost than a traditional photo lab.
265
Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

After you have your photo taken, allow a week to duplicate your publicity
photos. Ideally, you want to have your press kit folders, publicity photos, and
the printed materials within your press kit all completed around the same
time, so you can begin distributing the completed press kits to the media and
generate publicity for your book in a timely manner. I cover the distribution
of press materials later in this chapter.
Writing a Knockout Pitch Letter
A pitch letter accompanies a press kit; it introduces you and briefly states
why you’re sending the press kit and what it contains. In other words, pitch
your story in a way that perfectly addresses an audience interest as it relates
to you and your book.
Personalize the pitch letter to a specific person. As you write the letter, make
sure that it addresses the needs of the person you’re sending it to and that
the information you’re sending is normally covered. For example, if your
book is about sports, don’t send your press kit and letter to the lifestyle
editor or even the managing editor of a newspaper. Address your packet
directly to the sports editor. See “Starting a target press list,” later in this
chapter, for more.
Write your pitch letter in a traditional business letter style and keep the
length under one page. Here’s what the format should include:
 First paragraph: Introduce your book.
 Second paragraph: Talk about why you’re an expert in your field.
 Third paragraph: Showcase exactly why the recipient’s audience is
interested in your book and what you have to say. If you’re pitching
yourself as a guest on a radio talk show, describe some of the reasons
why you’d make an entertaining and informative guest.
 Final paragraph: Invite the reporter, journalist, editor, or producer to
review the enclosed press kit, request a review copy of your book, and
contact you if they’re interested in booking an interview or receiving
more information. If you’re e-mailing your initial pitch letter, you may
also want to add a sentence inviting the pitch letter’s recipient to visit
your Web site to obtain more information. See Figure 18-3 for a template
that you can use to create a pitch letter.
If you have a publicist, have him or her sign the pitch letter on your behalf.

Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

Creating an Electronic Press Kit
An electronic press kit (EPK) showcases you in audio or video form and allows
a media outlet to see exactly who you are, what you look like, and how well
you speak before you’re booked on a show. An EPK can be an audio CD, VHS
tape, or DVD that contains a sample interview with you, information about
your book, and/or clips from past radio and TV interviews you’ve done. If
you’re looking to get booked as a guest on TV and radio shows, seriously
consider producing an EPK to compliment your traditional printed press kit.
Realistically, you probably don’t need an EPK right away as you kick off your
book’s PR campaign. Wait until you have several really good local or regional
radio or TV interviews under your belt, and then include a few on your EPK
before pitching to national radio or TV shows. (A really good interview por-
trays you and your book in the best possible way, highlights your PR mes-
sage, and is something you’re proud to show people as a sampling of your
work and the publicity you’ve received.)
Ideally, your EPK should contain a short video or audio-only interview with
you and several clips from radio or TV interviews. Keep the length of your
EPK under five minutes. The goal of this compilation is to showcase you as a
well-spoken, media-savvy individual who is a great guest on radio or TV
shows. Also post clips from radio and TV interviews on your Web site.
For help filming, recording, editing, or producing an EPK, contact any local
video or audio production company in your area. You can find listings for
these companies online or in the Yellow Pages. You have to pay the produc-
tion costs associated with producing the EPK, which can cost anywhere from
several hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on its complexity,
length and what’s involved in the actual filming.
To save money, some authors incorporate audio or video clips of past inter-
views on their Web sites, as opposed to having a separate audio CD or DVD
produced and duplicated. Make sure to reference the Web site (and a specific
link) in the press kit so producers and such can look up your clips online. See
Chapter 21 for more innovative ways to use your Web site.
Distributing Your Press 
Materials to the Media
After you’ve gathered all of the elements for your press kit, the next step
involves distributing your press kit and making contact with the media.
268
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

In the following sections, you discover how to begin finding and targeting
members of the press. You also find out how important keeping a budget is,
especially when distributing all your costly materials, and how to keep media
lead times in mind as you send off materials.
Starting a targeted press list
The first step in kicking off any PR campaign is to carefully target the media
and develop your own press list. Follow these steps:
1. Sit down with a pad and pen.
Write down all the print media outlets you want to pitch your book to.
2. Visit a large newsstand to see firsthand all the newspapers and maga-
zines out there.
Don’t forget to target special interest, niche and industry-oriented news-
papers and magazines, if they’re appropriate. (See “Media categorized
by geography and audience,” earlier in this chapter.)
3. Create a separate list of TV and radio outlets you’d like to appear on
as a guest or expert.
These outlets can include news programs where you’re interviewed as
an expert on a newsworthy topic that somehow relates to your book.
Are you only looking for local or regional media attention, or do you think
that your book may appeal to readers throughout the United States and per-
haps other countries? As you consider these questions, be realistic. Sure, you
may want to be a guest on The Today Show, but is the topic of your book
truly of interest to the viewers? To generate the best results from your PR
efforts, carefully target the media outlets and approach only appropriate
channels, based on the target audience of your book.
After you gather your list of media outlets you want to target, track down the
specific journalist, reporter, editor, producer, or talent booker who works for
each media outlet and who is responsible for covering the topic you’re pitch-
ing. For example:
 If you’re looking to obtain book reviews from newspapers, target the
book reviews editor.
 If you’ve written an autobiography or a book that has a strong human
interest element, contact the features editor of newspapers.

Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

Contacting the wrong reporter, journalist, editor, talent booker, or producer
not only wastes your time and money, but also wastes the time of the media
professionals you contact. The wrong person has no interest in what you’re
pitching. Don’t rely on one person within a media organization to pass along
your book and press materials to the appropriate person. You need to
research and track down the right person yourself.
Follow these tips for tracking down the right person to hand off your materi-
als to:
 Contact the main switchboard or receptionist at each media outlet.
 Purchase an up-to-date media directory (see the next section).
 When you contact electronic media, such as radio or television shows,
pinpoint exact shows that you’re interested in being a guest on. Call the
production office for that show and ask for the name of a segment pro-
ducer or talent booker who is responsible for booking guests.
Don’t try to pitch your idea directly to the executive producer or host.
At smaller shows, especially at local radio or TV stations, you may dis-
cover that the person responsible for booking guests is the show’s exec-
utive producer or even the host. Unless you know that this information
is true, first contact a segment producer or talent booker at a show.
 Pitch your story through e-mail. One of the most convenient (and least
expensive) ways to pitch a story idea to a media outlet is via e-mail.
Based on the response you receive from your initial e-mail pitch, you 
can then send a complete printed press kit and a review copy of your
book. You can also direct the media professional to visit your Web site
(where your press materials are listed) for more information about the
book and you as an author/expert.
Using media directories
A handful of directories, publications, and online databases used by profes-
sional publicists contain detailed contact information for every reporter,
journalist, editor, and producer at every newspaper, magazine, radio station,
and television station. These directories are a starting point for developing
your media list.
Before investing in any media directory, determine whether the information
is what you need, based on the type of media and specific contact you’re
looking for. Also, determine how often the directories are updated and veri-
fied for accuracy. Any information that’s more than six months old contains
outdated listings.

Keeping your budget in mind
Launching a comprehensive PR campaign can become costly. Take a look at
the following list of items when considering your budget:
 Creating a professional looking press kit: $2 to $5 or more per kit.
 Copies of your book with each press kit: Costs vary.
 Postage and shipping costs: Costs vary.
Ideally, to get attention from the recipient who receives dozens of press
kits daily, send your press kit via U.S. Priority Mail or by using one of the
popular overnight carriers (FedEx, UPS, or DHL).
 Phone calls to media professionals: Costs vary.
Simply sending out a mass-mailing of press materials to media outlets
you’ve never contacted works to some extent, but this approach is more
costly than targeting specific media outlets, making introductory phone
calls, and then sending out your materials after they’re requested.
Follow these money saving tips when sending out your packets:
 Only send out your press release in printed or e-mail form. Instruct
the recipients to request a full press kit and a review copy of your book.
This process ensures that you only send complete press kits and books
to people who’re interested. The downside to this is that you only have
your one-page press release to sell your PR pitch to the journalist as
opposed to all the content within your press kit and actual book.
272
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

 Make preliminary phone calls to each media outlet to determine inter-
est and then send out press kits only to those people who specifically
request the information. Don’t harass people working in the media with
a constant influx of phone calls, e-mails, or faxes. Media folks work
under tight deadlines and have little time for long pitches.
 Target only a handful of media outlets at first and slowly build up and
expand your PR efforts. Consider limiting your approach to 50 major
newspapers and magazines to include a review of your book in their Book
Reviews section, and 50 talk radio shows you want to be a guest on.
For general information on keeping costs under control, check out Chapter 6.
Paying attention to media lead times
All media outlets work with a lead time, which is the time between when the
print article is actually written and when it appears on the newsstand. Some
magazines preplan future issues four to six months in advance. Some TV
shows book guests a month in advance. Even after a media outlet expresses
an interest in reviewing your book, an appearance of your review can take up
to three months or longer, so be patient.
Plan your PR efforts based around each media outlet’s lead time. If you know
that a lead time for a magazine is three months, begin contacting the appro-
priate writer or editor of that magazine four or five months before the publi-
cation of your book.
To help ensure that you get the media attention you and your book deserve,
make sure that you kick off your PR efforts well in advance of your book’s
release date. After the book is released, many media outlets no longer con-
sider the new book newsworthy. You’ll find that most media outlets try to
coordinate their coverage with the actual release date of your book.
Here are general guidelines for lead times to expect from each type of outlet:
 Newspapers
• Major Daily & Local: These publications have a lead time of
between a few hours (same day) and up to two weeks, depending
on the section of the newspaper and the topic.
• Weekly: Most weekly newspapers have a two to four week lead
time.
 Magazines
• Weekly: Plan on at least a two to four week lead time for weekly
magazines, unless the topic is extremely timely and newsworthy.
273
Chapter 18: Crafting Publicity Materials for Your Book

• Monthly: The average lead time of a monthly regional or national
magazine is about three months.
• Quarterly: Because these magazines are only published four times
per year, their lead times can be four to six months.
 Radio Shows: Most radio shows book guests between one day and sev-
eral weeks in advance, depending on the timeliness of the topic. When
approaching radio shows to be a guest, make your availability clear —
you can fill in on a last-minute basis or if another guest cancels with
little or no notice.
 Television Shows: Depending on the type of TV show, guests are booked
anywhere from a few hours to several weeks prior to airtime. News pro-
grams, like the local evening news, may book guests a few hours before
the broadcast, while a national talk show may book several weeks in
advance, unless a topic is extremely newsworthy or timely.
 Web sites: Information changes in cyberspace almost instantly. A Web
site operator can potentially post information about your book within
minutes after receiving your press kit.

In This Chapter
 Speaking with the media
 Putting on a polished appearance
 Pursuing book reviews
 Setting up author appearances and book signings
 Working with a professional publicist or PR firm
A
re you convinced you’ve written what could become a bestseller? Do
you want to see yourself on television, make radio appearances, and
have the opportunity to read reviews of your book in your favorite newspa-
pers, magazines, and Web sites? If so, focus on generating free publicity by
soliciting the help of the media.
Public relations (PR) is all about utilizing the media — newspapers, maga-
zines, radio stations, TV stations, and Web sites — to generate reviews, arti-
cles, feature stories, and interviews about you and your book. As opposed to
paid advertising (which I cover in Chapter 20), when a media outlet writes 
an article about your book, or when you appear as a guest on a TV or radio
show, you don’t have to pay the media outlet for the coverage. It’s free, and
it’s an extremely powerful tool for reaching potential readers at all levels.
People are more apt to purchase your book after spending several minutes
reading about you and your book or listening to an interview with you than
they are to respond to a paid ad, which they spend just a few seconds at 
best glancing over.
In Chapter 18, you discover how to create and distribute a professional press
kit to help promote your book. But this chapter puts the fruits of your labor
to work as you promote the publication of your new book. You find out how
to speak to (and look good in front of) the media, generate book reviews, and
set up special appearances like book signings.

Ideally, if you’ve never done any type of PR work, you should seriously con-
sider hiring a professional publicist or PR firm to help you develop and
launch a comprehensive PR campaign for your book. In this chapter, you dis-
cover how to hire a publicist and why this person can be extremely benefi-
cial, assuming you have the budget.
Talk It Up: Saying the Right 
Thing to the Media
By using your press kit, begin contacting key media outlets and pitching your
story (see Chapter 18 for full details about how to do this). Assuming that
you do everything correctly, chances are, you start booking interviews with
newspapers and magazines, and you may even get invited to be a guest on
radio and television shows. Now that you have the opportunity to generate
publicity for yourself and your book, make the most of it.
During an interview, make sure to
 Talk about your book and yourself.
 Establish yourself as an expert.
 Convince viewers that your book offers something interesting, informa-
tive, entertaining, and/or newsworthy.
 Note that your book is worth purchasing and reading.
What you say during an interview and how you say it are critical for achiev-
ing your objective. Your goal is to ensure that no matter what questions
you’re asked during an interview that you communicate your PR message
accurately, effectively, and hopefully repeatedly.
In the following sections, I explain how to anticipate and prepare for basic
questions, stay focused on the message you want to convey about your book,
and sprinkle your book’s title into your interview. I also give you tips on how
to avoid a few common interview blunders.
Here are a couple of things to watch out for before you do any interview:
 Avoid being misquoted or taken out of context. Do interviews in
person or over the telephone. Some journalists like to rely on e-mail
interviews, in which they send a list of questions and ask you to e-mail
back your responses. Try to avoid this type of interview, if possible. It’s
much easier to gauge what to say to a specific journalist if you’re speak-
ing with him or her in person or over the phone.
276
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

 Make sure that prior to an interview, particularly a TV appearance,
you get plenty of sleep. You want to look well rested. Never drink too
much coffee or any alcohol before an interview, either to wake you up or
calm you down. Too much caffeine can cause you to shake and look ner-
vous, and alcohol of any kind can impede your ability to think clearly,
especially if you’re nervous.
Anticipating and preparing 
for basic questions
After you start doing a bunch of interviews, you’re going to notice that whether
the interview is for television, radio, or print, the same basic questions keep
popping up. Use this to you advantage because you can figure out the very
best way to answer each of those questions.
To prepare for interview questions, follow these three steps:
1. Create a list of 10 to 20 sample questions you anticipate being asked.
2. Develop short sound bites that answer each question.
3. Practice answering each question by using your sound bite so that your
response comes off as natural, engaging, positive, and informative.
I cover each of these steps in the following sections.
Listing sample questions
The questions during your interviews may vary greatly, but most media folks
start off by asking basic questions about you and your book. These questions
are easy to anticipate because they typically involve answering who, what,
when, where, why, and how.
Here are a few sample interview questions:
 Tell me about your book. What’s it about?
 What inspired you to write your book?
 What initially got you interested in this topic?
 Who would be interested in reading your book?
 When is your book being released, and how can someone obtain a copy?
 What was the most interesting or unusual thing you learned when
researching your book?
 How much research went into the writing of your book? What type of
research did you do?
277
Chapter 19: Publicizing Your Book for Free with the Media’s Help

 What sets your book apart from others?
 What are three things someone can learn from reading your book?
As you answer these and other questions, provide information directly from
your book as a preview of what readers can expect. This answer helps demon-
strate that the content of your book is valuable, relevant, and interesting.
Obviously, if you’ve written a novel or work of fiction, never reveal the ending!
Another easy way to anticipate questions you may be asked: Provide the
questions! In Chapter 18, I note that as part of your author bio, you may con-
sider including five or ten sample questions an interviewer can ask you. Don’t
be surprised if you hear some of those questions come back to you!
Developing sound bites
Most television and radio interviews last only three to five minutes. You need
to convey a lot of information, without speaking too quickly. The best way to
do this is to speak in what the media industry calls sound bites. For every
question, provide a comprehensive answer that lasts between 5 and 15 sec-
onds (that’s fewer than 50 words).
By anticipating what questions you may be asked (see the previous section)
and knowing your subject matter well, you can write answers out ahead of
time that communicate the necessary information but that are very concise.
Answering a question in a sound bite means using as few words as possible.
In other words, don’t babble or ramble on. Answer the question, get your key
point across, and wait for the next question. Don’t go off on tangents.
Discovering how to speak in sound bites ensures that you can answer the
maximum number of interview questions in the time allotted, giving you
greater opportunity to promote yourself and your book. Also, when you’re
participating in pre-taped interviews, speaking in sound bites makes editing
an interview easier, and you don’t have to cut your answers short or worry
about your information being taken out of context.
Practicing your answers
After you create a list of potential questions, think up one or two key points
you want to convey as part of each answer. Next, grab a stopwatch and 
practice answering each question in less than 15 seconds (without simply
responding yes or no). It’s a good idea to record your responses so you can
play them back and hear firsthand how you sound. This method allows you
to critique how you responded. Do you sound intelligent, like an expert on
the topic? Is your answer informative? By the time you actually start partici-
pating in interviews, you should be able to recite answers to common ques-
tions flawlessly.
278
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Here are a few additional tips for polishing your answers:
 Convey a sense of authority when you speak. Use complete sentences,
using proper grammar. Avoid using slang or words like umm or yeah.
Answer questions confidently and use humor when appropriate.
 Repeat the question you were just asked by the reporter and then pro-
vide your answer in the form of a sound bite. For example, if you’re
asked, “So, what made you write your book?,” your response might be,
“What inspired me to write my book was . . . “ Or, if you’re asked,
“What’s your book about?,” your response might be, “[Insert book title]
is about . . .”
 Answer questions like it’s the first time you’ve been asked. Even if
you’re asked the same question 1,000 times, never respond to a reporter
by saying something like, “I get asked that question constantly,” “People
always ask me that,” or “You already asked me that.” When you respond
to any question, even if it’s one you’ve answered many times before, you
need to come across to the interviewer and your audience as if it’s the
first time you’ve ever been asked that question. Take a second to think
about your response (even though you know exactly what it is), and
make the interviewer think he’s just asked you the most original and
intelligent question you’ve ever been asked. Then, respond with enthusi-
asm. Also, make sure that your answers don’t alienate your audience. For
example, offering a strong opinion on a controversial topic or making any
kind of insulting or racist comment can easily alienate the audience.
 Be prepared to answer uninformed questions. Often, when someone
interviews you, he probably hasn’t read your book. He also knows little
or nothing about the book’s topic. If you’re asked what you believe is a
stupid question, play along and don’t make the interviewer look stupid,
but make sure you get your marketing message across to the audience.
Focusing on your PR message
Participating in interviews is fun; however, it’s important to focus on the
reason why you’re doing the interview — to promote your book.
No matter what questions you’re asked, it’s up to you to ensure that you
convey your PR message at least twice or three times during the interview,
even if that interview lasts only one to three minutes. Your PR message essen-
tially describes your book and tells people why they should read it. Your PR
message can be a one- or two-sentence summary of the unique content your
book offers or how the reader will benefit from reading it. (See Chapter 18 for
more details on creating a PR message.)
279
Chapter 19: Publicizing Your Book for Free with the Media’s Help

No matter what questions you’re asked during your interview, be sure to work
in comments like “Well, within my book, I explain . . .” or “As you’ll read in
Chapter 2 of my book . . .” Even though you’re being interviewed as an expert
on a topic and you’re expected to provide information, your goal in doing the
interview is to sell books. Strike a balance between giving away lots of free
information during an interview and enticing people to read your book to
obtain the information.
Mentioning your book title multiple times
During an interview, you ideally want to mention the title of your book at least
three times and mention where the book is available at least twice. This may
include promoting your book’s Web site address (see Chapter 21 for more
about creating a site for your book) or saying that the book is currently avail-
able through online booksellers like Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble.com (see
Chapter 14 for more about these channels). Typically, when talk show hosts
are introducing you, they mention your name and your book title at least
once. It’s up to you, however, to make sure that you work it into the conversa-
tion additional times without being annoying about it.
One easy way to mention your book’s title is simply to begin your answers
with it. Try out the following examples:
 “In my book, [insert title], I wrote about . . .”
 “That’s a great question. In chapter [#] of my book [insert title], I dis-
cussed that exact topic . . .”
 “To answer that question, I’d like to tell you a story that I included
within my book, [insert title] . . .”
Avoiding common interview mistakes
Your goal during any interview is to promote your book and to come across
as an intelligent and well-spoken expert on a topic. You also want to be
respected and liked by both the interviewer and the audience or reader. To
ensure that you get the best possible response from your interviews, avoid
making these common mistakes:
 Allowing the interviewer to provoke you into discussing a controversial
topic and make you angry or overly emotional about it: Especially if
you’re a guest on a morning radio show hosted by “shock jocks,” you may
come across someone who believes it’s entertaining to anger guests or try
280
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

to confuse them with inappropriate questions. This is showbiz. Your best
bet is to go along with the antics, but stay focused on getting your mes-
sage out to the public. Promote your book, but try to have fun. You always
have the option of not answering a question or changing the topic during
an interview. Don’t get agitated or lash out at the interviewer.
 Coming across as too nervous, unprepared, offensive, or confronta-
tional: The best way to avoid this is to prepare and rehearse (see
“Anticipating and preparing for basic questions,” earlier in this chapter).
Take deep breaths and speak normally.
 Cutting off the interviewer in mid-sentence as she asks a question,
because you’re able to anticipate what’s about to be asked: You may
be asked the same questions over and over again. Even if you’ve heard
that same question a hundred times, it’s the first time that particular
interviewer has asked it and the first time that audience will be hearing
it. Allow the interviewer to finish, and then respond. Otherwise, you
come off as arrogant.
 Mumbling your responses to questions or not speaking with proper
grammar and in full sentences: Never respond to a question by nodding
your head or with a one-word answer. Responding “yes” or “no” to a
question isn’t adequate. Speak with authority and share the knowledge
you possess.
 Overly promoting your book, without providing the reader or listener
with information about the topic being discussed: While you want to
work in mentions of your book at least two or three times during an
interview (see the previous section), you also want to convey informa-
tion about the topic being discussed. Don’t keep replying, “You have to
read my book for the answer to that question.” You’re better off answer-
ing the interviewer’s question but adding a phrase like, “I go into a lot
more detail on that topic within my book.”
 Speaking too quickly when answering questions: Pace yourself and
breathe.
 Taking too long to respond to questions or babbling too much about
nothing: Make sure you make proper use of your sound bites as you
answer each and every question.
 Telling the interviewer that the question is stupid: Never insult the
interviewer or make him feel inferior. Even if a question is stupid, act 
as if it’s a brilliant question and you’re excited to answer it. Remember,
you’re an expert on a topic. The interviewer may know nothing about
the topic, but he’s giving you a chance to promote yourself and your
book. Use this opportunity to your advantage.
No matter what type of interview you’re participating in, make sure that
you’re introduced or credited appropriately. Develop a one-sentence intro-
duction that the media can use to introduce you. This credit should focus on
you as the author of your book and establish your credentials as an expert in
your field.

Dress It Up: Looking Good When 
You Promote Your Book
You’re being invited to discuss your book because you’ve written about a
topic of interest to a particular audience. Now, in addition to sounding like an
expert, you need to look like one. How you look adds or detracts from your
credibility. The following sections focus on what to wear and how to control
your body language.
Dressing your best
When you participate in interviews, you want to look your best. Even when
interviewing on the radio when people don’t see you, looking professional
helps boost your credibility and your confidence. (If you’re participating in
radio interviews by phone from home, you can relax in your pajamas during
the interview, and the following sections may not apply to you.)
The following sections contain guidelines to help you perfect your appear-
ance for any event. Here are a couple of quick tips to help you look your best:
 Watch the TV program you’re going to appear on for several days
prior to your appearance. Pay careful attention to what the hosts and
other guests are wearing and dress accordingly.
 Don’t wait until the last minute to get ready for an interview. Try out
your complete outfit (accessories and hairstyle included) the day before
the interview. On the day of the interview, get ready several hours early
in case you need to make last-minute adjustments.
282

Publicity boot camp: Considering 
professional media training
If you’re doing a lot of interviews, one of the best
ways to quickly become media savvy is to
undergo intensive media training. Although you
can read about how to develop the skills you
need, you benefit much more from working with
a media training expert. This training involves
one-on-one sessions with a skilled PR profes-
sional or experienced broadcaster who teaches
you everything you need to know about how to
be interviewed, how to interact with the media,
and how to fine-tune your PR message. Most
media training sessions last one or two full days.
To find media training opportunities in your area,
search the Internet under media training or
check your local Yellow Pages under PR firms.

Your outfit
Feeling stumped about what to wear? Try the following tips:
 Choose a stylish outfit, keeping in mind the image you’re trying to convey.
For example, dress more formally for a business or news-oriented show
and casually for an upbeat morning show. Overall, try to dress along the
same lines as the host(s).
 Make sure that everything fits you perfectly and is wrinkle-free and looks
good on you — not just the mannequin in the store.
 Pay attention to colors and patterns. Never wear busy patterns or solid
white on television.
Your objective is to look good, not to make a fashion statement like those
celebrities waltzing down the red carpet at an awards show. If necessary,
think about what Joan Rivers would say about your outfit if she were to see
you on TV and rate your outfit like she does with celebrities. Would you make
her best or worst dressed list?
If you’re having trouble deciding on an outfit, read a few current issues of
fashion magazines and visit a store that offers a personal shopping service 
to help you choose what you wear. You can also hire a personal stylist to 
go shopping with you, if it’s absolutely necessary. But keep your budget in
mind! You can also find good advice from friends and coworkers.
Your accessories
When putting yourself together as a complete package, you may want to con-
sider extra accessories like shoes, hats, scarves, jewelry, and so on. Here are
a few things to consider when dressing up an outfit:
 Shoes: Shine your shoes and coordinate them with your outfit and
accessories, especially your belt. Don’t wear shoes that hurt your feet or
that you have trouble walking in just because they look good. Unless
you’re doing a comedy routine, you don’t want to trip on live television.
 Add-ons: The accessories you wear should all complement your outfit
and not be distracting. Make sure to wear things that are tasteful and
not overbearing from a visual standpoint. Examples include
• Hats: Refrain from wearing a hat. Hats hide your eyes and interact
funky with stage lights if you’re on TV.
• Glasses: Wear them for vision purposes only, not because you
think that you look ultra cool. If you wear prescription glasses,
either invest in antiglare lenses or wear contact lenses. Regular
lenses reflect TV studio lights, which can make you look bad.
• Jewelry: Choose items such as bracelets, necklaces, earrings, cuff
links, or tie tacks that are subtle and complement your outfit.
Jewelry that’s too sparkly or shiny can be distracting.
283
Chapter 19: Publicizing Your Book for Free with the Media’s Help

Your personal grooming, hairstyle, and makeup
First impressions are important. Shower before your interview and apply 
any necessary products to control oiliness or dryness on your face and neck.
Don’t wear heavy perfumes or colognes that may knock out the person next
to you. Also, have clean fingernails and be clean shaven.
If you have a hairstylist, make sure that he’s consistent with the image you’re
trying to convey. Some TV shows have a hairstylist on staff who offers to
style your hair right before your appearance. This is good in a pinch; how-
ever, you should rely on your own stylist to work on your hair prior to the
interview. But most people won’t have a personal stylist, so plan on arriving
to the studio ready to go.
As for makeup (particularly on TV appearances):
 For men, allow the show’s makeup artist to apply the necessary makeup
to your face and neck. This application hides blemishes and makes your
face look fresh. Don’t worry; the makeup won’t be noticeable on camera,
so your masculinity remains intact.
 For women, if you choose to apply your own makeup or use your own
artist, keep in mind that you look different on television than you do in
the mirror. Before your on-air appearance, be sure to check with the
show’s makeup artist to ensure that you look your best.
Controlling your body language
Most people aren’t aware of their own body language, mainly because in every-
day life, they don’t watch themselves speak or interact with other people. But
your body language is something you always have to be aware of and control.
Learning to look comfortable during and interview takes practice. If you have
nervous habits, such as tapping your foot, twirling your hair, blinking too
much, or waving your arms around wildly when you speak, you need to elimi-
nate these habits.
The best ways to control your body language is to videotape yourself doing
practice interviews and then seek out help from people close to you to help
you identify potential problems. If you undergo professional media training
(see the earlier sidebar “Publicity boot camp: Considering professional media
training”), you find out how to control your body language.
Sit up straight, make eye contact with the person or people you’re speaking
to, and showcase your personality without being over the top or over-
emphasizing your gestures.
284
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

It’s perfectly normal to be nervous before and during an interview. Try the
following tips to help you relax:
 Make sure that you take deep breaths to calm yourself down; know that
you look your best and that you’re prepared for the interview, and go
into the studio as confident as possible.
 Don’t pay any attention to the cameras if you’re doing a TV interview.
Focus on having a discussion with the show’s host. The camera opera-
tors and show’s director makes sure that you look good on television.
Don’t allow your eyes to wander around aimlessly as you try to figure
out which camera you should look into.
Book It: Generating Reviews
Book reviews are a great publicity tool (assuming the reviews your book gener-
ates are favorable). When sending out review copies of your book, be sure to
include a complete press kit and cover letter (see Chapter 18 for more about
these items and about initial contact with the media). It’s important that the
editor, reporter, or journalist have all of your information in one place. Even if
you already sent a press kit and you’re following up with a review copy of the
book, send another press kit. Editors, reporters, and journalists often receive
dozens of press kits per day. Don’t assume the original material you sent was
kept and is readily available.
If the target publication has a long lead time, it’s acceptable to send galleys
(laid-out pages) of the book. A reviewer would rather receive an advance
copy of the book in galley form than wait until after it’s released to the public.
Most editors like to time book reviews in conjunction with the book’s release,
not after it, so plan accordingly.
As you generate positive reviews, reprint copies of them and include them
within your book’s press kit. You also can use excerpts from positive reviews
in your book’s advertising (see Chapter 20 for more about book ads) and on
your Web site (see Chapter 21 for more about setting up a book Web site).
Show It Off: Coordinating Author
Appearances and Book Signings
In addition to generating publicity in the media with interviews and reviews,
one free way to let potential readers know your book exists is to participate
in author appearances (such as readings) and book signings. These events
are fun and allow the author to meet and interact with people interested in
the topic. It’s a great networking opportunity (and you may sell more books).
285
Chapter 19: Publicizing Your Book for Free with the Media’s Help

Keep in mind that unless you can drive hundreds of people to your event,
you may not make a ton of money signing books at a bookstore, but you can
use this event as a way to generate local publicity. Many newspapers run a
short article announcing a book signing event or author appearance. That
publicity is more valuable to you and allows you to reach more potential
readers than the actual event.
In the following sections, I explain how to set up an event, conduct yourself
professionally, and plan a tour.
Planning and promoting an event
A few weeks before your book’s release date, contact a few bookstores in
major markets and speak with the store manager about doing a book signing,
hosting a discussion, or making an author appearance. Most bookstore man-
agers welcome the opportunity to have authors visit their store because
these events drive traffic into the store.
It’s always easier to start booking appearances and author signings in your
local area, so contact the managers of local bookstores first. Depending on
how things go, you can always plan a more extensive book tour later (I cover
book tours later in this chapter).
When planning a book signing, make sure that you have an ample number of
copies of your books at the location, based on the anticipated turnout. Because
your book is self-published, it’s up to you to work with the bookstore to ensure
that enough books are on hand for your event and that your event is promoted
properly.
After you receive a commitment from one or more bookstores to participate,
supply the locations with fliers and/or posters to promote the event. Don’t
rely on the location to promote the event for you. They may not promote it 
at all, or they could put up fliers that you don’t like. You should also contact
local media, particularly newspapers and radio stations, to get them to help
you promote the event in their calendar or event listings. (You can use some
of the press materials I describe in Chapter 18.) Being able to promote a book
signing when you’re a guest on a local talk radio show is also beneficial.
Setting up an event for smooth sailing
Determine exactly what to expect from the event in advance so that the event
itself goes smoothly. Consider the following:
 Before the event, talk with the store manager to discuss what you’ll be
doing and what’s expected of you. Will you have a podium to speak
from? Will you sit behind a table to sign books?
286
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

 Find out what you need to bring (aside from markers to sign books). Can
you distribute promotional materials, like postcards or bookmarks (cov-
ered in Chapter 20)?
 Decide whether you’ll sell your own books or have someone there to
handle the money while you interact with readers.
 During the actual appearance, smile, be approachable, and talk to the
people who come to see you. Try to strike up conversations, answer
questions, and come across as a charming and caring individual.
 If you’re signing autographs, make sure you spell each person’s name
correctly. If you’re not sure of the spelling, ask.
 When you sign books, try to incorporate a short message (one sentence
maximum) in addition to your signature (if you have time). You can
write, “Enjoy the book,” “Thanks for your support,” or “It was a pleasure
meeting you.” Be creative and when possible, write something personal,
not just “Best wishes.”
Taking your act on the road
Depending on your budget (see Chapter 6 for more about money matters),
you may decide to embark on a multiple city book tour, which would com-
bine booking signings, author appearances, and interviews with local media
in each city you visit. Such a tour requires a time commitment, so be sure
that the traveling fits within your schedule.
To get the most out of your investment in a book tour (because you have 
to pay for your travel expenses to get from city to city), you may be able to
book some paid appearances or lectures at schools, universities, or various
other types of organizations to help reduce the out-of-pocket expenses. See
Chapter 22 for more about becoming a public speaker.
Keep in mind that planning a successful book tour requires a significant
amount of pre-planning and coordination. Your overall objective, of course, 
is to boost awareness of your book and to sell as many copies of your book
as possible.
Leave It to the Pros: Working 
with a Publicist
Based on everything in this chapter and in Chapter 18 about creating a press
kit, contacting the media, pitching stories, and participating in interviews, 
you may decide to leave this type of work to proven professionals. Freelance
287
Chapter 19: Publicizing Your Book for Free with the Media’s Help

publicists or PR firms work with you to develop, launch, and manage your
book’s PR campaign. In the following sections, I discuss a publicist’s responsi-
bilities, tips for finding and hiring a publicist, and fees for a publicist’s ser-
vices.
What can a publicist do for you?
Instead of investing your own valuable time doing all the busy work associ-
ated with developing, launching, and managing a successful PR campaign
(and yes, it requires a significant time and financial investment), hire a publi-
cist or PR firm to get the job done correctly. These associates can
 Create your entire press kit or just write your press release and author
bio
 Take the press kit you create and use it to pitch stories to the media and
handle all media contact on your behalf, including sending out review
copies of your book
 Help you book interviews because most PR professionals already have
well-established media contacts and have a much easier time getting
you booked
 Help you define and establish your image as a published author and
expert in your field
 Provide intensive media training for you
 Schedule paid appearances, lectures, and appearances on your behalf
 Assist you in planning a multiple-city book tour
How do you find a publicist?
Many PR firms and freelance publicists specialize only in promoting authors.
Others specialize in promoting experts or companies working in specific
industries or cater to only certain types of media.
When looking to hire a publicist (you should do so about two to three
months before your book’s publication date), the following considerations
are important:
 The PR professional has a thorough understanding of what you’re trying
to accomplish and the audience you’re trying to reach
 The person has established contacts with the appropriate media outlets
you’re interested in
 The publicist or PR firm knows your expectations and timeframe
288
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

 The PR firm shares your vision for what needs to be accomplished
 You need to work well with the account executive(s) or PR professionals
You can find a publicist in many ways:
 Check out publishing industry magazines, such as Publishers Weekly
(www.publishersweekly.com) or Writer’s Digest (www.writers
digest.com), and look for ads from PR firms.
 Consult your local Yellow Pages or surf the Internet (search for “literary
publicist” or “book publicist”).
 Contact a professional trade association, such as the Public Relations
Society of America (www.prsa.org), and ask for a referral.
 Seek out a referral from another author or company you know that’s
worked with a PR firm.
 Visit www.elance.com and solicit bids from freelance publicists based
on what services you require.
How much should a publicist cost?
Depending on the services you want a publicist to handle and whether you
hire an established PR firm or a freelance PR specialist, the cost varies
greatly. Keep in mind that in addition to paying for the publicist’s time and
expertise, you’re also responsible for all expenses (including phone calls,
mailing costs, printing costs, travel, and so on).
You can compensate publicist in a variety of ways:
 A pre-determined hourly fee (plus expenses)
 A flat, per-project fee (plus expenses)
 A weekly or monthly retainer (plus expenses)
 By scheduled interviews
When your PR person schedules interviews for you, he receives pre-determined
rates based on each type of interview. You pay separately for each radio
interview, TV interview, or print review/article.
You may pay up to $150 per hour or a monthly retainer of $2,000 (plus
expenses) for a PR person. For a publicist to truly do a thorough job with
your campaign, she needs between one and three months, due to lead times
of various media outlets and the time needed to properly make contact with
each media outlet.

Marketing Your Book with Paid
Advertising and Promotional Tools
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the pros and cons of paid advertising to sell your book
 Choosing the best places to advertise your book
 Putting together a winning advertising campaign
 Using promotional tools to your advantage
I
n Chapters 18 and 19, you discover how to tap the power of the media to
generate free publicity for your book and yourself. You can do this by
approaching print, electronic, and online media with publicity materials like a
press release and getting these outlets to review your book, feature it in edi-
torial coverage, or interview you as an expert on the topic of your book.
Free publicity is wonderful and helps generate sales of your book; however,
you seldom have total control over what’s written or said about your book or
when the coverage actually appears. With paid advertising, however, you have
100 percent control over your advertising message and can decide exactly
when and where your advertisements are seen or heard. This control allows
you to target your book’s potential audience.
This chapter is about how to utilize paid advertising to help sell your book. I
cover the pros and cons of paid advertising, help you decide where to adver-
tise, and give tips on planning a successful campaign. I also focus on how to
use promotional materials, like bookmarks and postcards, to boost aware-
ness of your book.
I cover the nuts and bolts of paid advertising in this chapter. For more
details, check out Advertising For Dummies (Wiley) by Gary Dahl. The book
features tips on creating ads, working within your budget, and more.

Checking Out the Pros and 
Cons of Paid Advertising
Paid advertising is when you create an ad. That ad can be a classified or dis-
play ad in a newspaper, newsletter, or magazine; a 30- or 60-second radio or
television ad; an animated banner ad for the Internet; or a billboard. In the
following sections, I explain the advantages and disadvantages of using paid
advertising to sell your self-published book.
The benefits
A well-designed ad that appears in the right media outlet has the potential to
be seen or heard, and then immediately be acted upon by the consumer, who
will (hopefully) call a toll-free number or visit a Web site to order your book,
or visit their favorite bookstore to purchase it.
Keep that purchasing power in mind, and consider the benefits of paid 
advertising:
 You have 100-percent control over your advertising message.
 You decide exactly what’s said and the frequency with which the ad
appears.
 You can target your book’s specific audience by choosing the best
places to advertise.
Your objective is to determine your target audience, figure out how to best
reach that audience, and advertise in places where your ad is most apt to be
seen by those people. (Fear not; I show you how to figure out all this info in
the section “Deciding Where to Advertise to Reach Your Target Audience”
later in this chapter.)
The drawbacks
Unless you’re a multi-million-dollar corporation with a huge advertising
budget and the goal of reaching mass-market consumers, there are a few
drawbacks to paid advertising you want to consider, as I explain in the 
following sections.
292
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Your ad may be lost in the crowd
An ad can get easily lost in the bombardment of advertising people are con-
stantly exposed to. Every day, you’re flooded with advertising. It’s literally
everywhere. Companies do just about anything to capture your attention,
even for a split second, to promote its message. Because you’re exposed to
so much daily advertising, many of you may automatically phase it out of
your minds. Imagine yourself reading a magazine or newspaper and skipping
over the ads or pulling out those little insert cards and throwing them into
the trash. When you listen to the radio or watch TV, do you switch the sta-
tion/channel when the ads come on? Because of these habits, advertisers
have an even harder job of promoting their products.
When the roles are reversed and you become the advertiser, you have to find
innovative ways to communicate your message so people pay attention to
when it’s seen or heard. For paid advertising to work, you need to
 Create a highly effective ad, carefully targeting your audience
 Have the budget to ensure that your ad is seen multiple times by your
audience
 Choose the best possible media outlets to advertise with
One mistake and the money you invest in advertising may be wasted.
Advertising can be expensive
Mass media advertising can be costly, but you want to reach the most people
possible with your campaign. So where do you draw the line and how do you
get your name out there?
Many authors and publishers find that paid advertising to promote a book to
the public isn’t the best way to spend what limited advertising and marketing
dollars are available. Niche advertising, in conjunction with a public relations
campaign and other grassroots marketing efforts (see Chapters 18 and 19 
for more about publicity), often works much better and is a better use of
resources. With niche advertising, you find specific magazines, newspapers,
newsletters, web sites, or other publications that cater to a small but tar-
geted audience. These publications typically focus on a narrow topic. If you
can find a niche outlet that relates to the topic of your book, advertising in
that publication virtually guarantees that you reach the perfect audience.
Media outlets have long lead times
Another potential drawback is that most advertising media have a lead time of
several weeks or months. A lead time is the time it takes for the publication to
be written, edited, laid out, printed, and distributed. A magazine’s July issue,
for example, may have an advertising deadline of April or May. Newspapers
tend to have a shorter lead time (typically a few days or a week).
293
Chapter 20: Marketing Your Book with Paid Advertising and Promotional Tools

If you want your ad to run in the September issue of a publication, you need
to design, place, and pay for the ad up to three months in advance. Then,
when the ad comes out, assess the response rate to the ad. See “Tracking the
results of your ads,” later in this chapter for details.
Deciding Where to Advertise to 
Reach Your Target Audience
Before launching an advertising campaign for your book, determine exactly
who the target audience is for your book, and then figure out the best adver-
tising vehicles to potentially use to reach that audience. To successfully make
this determination, you need to understand the daily habits of your audience,
know what media they’re exposed to, and then determine how you can best
spend your advertising dollars to reach those people using the appropriate
forms of media.
There is no such thing as an all-in-one solution for creating an advertising
campaign or even a single effective ad. Every situation is different, based on
the type of book you’re trying to sell, the audience you’re trying to reach,
your budget, the geographic area(s) you’re planning to target, and your time
frame. If you choose to use paid advertising, focus on what you’re trying to
accomplish, and then research the best ways to achieve those objectives.
In the following sections, I discuss different media outlets that carry paid
advertising. I also show you how to match outlets to your target readers,
obtain advertising kits from outlets, and draw up an advertising budget.
Here are a couple of tips to help you start working:
 Find a successful book or product similar to what you’re offering and
determine exactly what was done to make it successful in terms of
advertising. Discover what’s worked in the past without trying to re-
invent the wheel.
 One way to capitalize on free publicity and maximize the impact of your
advertising dollars is to run ads with the media outlet(s) that give your
book free coverage in the form of a review, article, interview, or profile.
This helps ensure that the people interested in the article about your
book know exactly how and where to purchase it. For example, when a
media outlet interested in reviewing your book approaches you, call the
media outlet’s advertising department and look into advertising in that
same issue or on that same show. (See Chapter 19 for more about work-
ing with the media to publicize your book.)
294
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Surveying media outlets that 
carry paid advertising
Finding potential places to advertise your book won’t be a problem. Choosing
the best, most cost-effective places to advertise, however, requires extensive
research and careful planning. The following sections cover some of the most
common places where you can pay for advertising. Check out Chapter 18 for
more details on contacting different types of media outlets.
SRDS Media Solutions (Phone [800] 232-0772; Web site www.srds.com) 
publishes a series of detailed directories covering television stations, radio
stations, newspapers, and magazines published throughout the country. In
addition to offering information about each media outlet, it also lists average
advertising rates and provides contact information. The directories and ser-
vices offered by SRDS Media Solutions can help you pinpoint the best places
to advertise, based on the target audience you’re trying to reach and your
overall budget.
Print media
Print advertising offers you the opportunity to distribute your book’s market-
ing message to the readers of a specific publication, whether it’s a newspa-
per, a general interest magazine, a niche-oriented magazine, or a printed
newsletter:
 Newspapers: Choosing a newspaper outlet can be a good option if you’re
looking for an inexpensive way to reach a general audience. Newspapers
typically have a short lead time, so you can potentially begin receiving
orders for your book much faster than if you were to run a magazine ad.
To place an ad, contact the classified ad sales department of each news-
paper directly or work with a classified advertising network, which helps
you place a single ad in dozens or hundreds of newspapers at the same
time. Check out these agencies to help you:
• Advertising Network of Florida (ANF): Phone (866) 742-1373; Web
site www.national-classifieds.com
• Classified Nation: Phone (800) 227-7636; Web site www.
classifiednation.com
• Wide Area Classifieds: Phone (800) 324-8236; Web site www.wide
areaclassifieds.com
You also have several choices when you are looking for the type of
paper you want to advertise in. The choices include
• National newspapers, like USA Today
• Major daily newspaper (with circulations over 100,000)
• Regional and local newspapers published daily or weekly
295
Chapter 20: Marketing Your Book with Paid Advertising and Promotional Tools

Nettizen.com (www.nettizen.com/newspaper) is a comprehensive
online directory of newspapers throughout the world. You can use this
directory to pinpoint potential publications to advertise in. Editor &
Publisher magazine is another excellent resource. It’s a weekly, industry-
oriented magazine that covers the newspaper publishing business. From
the publication’s Web site (www.editorandpublisher.com), you can
subscribe to the magazine or purchase the annual Editor & Publisher
International Directory, which is a printed directory of newspapers
around the world.
 Consumer magazines: Running an ad in a magazine can be lucrative
because magazines tend to focus on a specific topic. So, the people read-
ing it are more apt to be interested in something being advertised that
also relates to the topic. Different types of magazines exist:
• National magazines: The circulation for these magazines is in the
millions. The titles include general interest publications, such as
Time, Newsweek, or People.
• Special interest or niche-oriented magazines: These mags have
much smaller circulations because they target defined audiences
comprised of people interested in specific topics. New York Dog
magazine, for example, is a full-color, monthly magazine that caters
only to upscale dog owners in the New York area.
Depending on the topic of your book, advertising in a niche-
oriented magazine can be very worthwhile. Magazine-Directory.
com (magazine-directory.com) is a free, online listing of 
many magazines published within The United States.
 Industry-oriented magazines: This type of magazine, also referred to as
a trade journal, is read by professionals working in a very specific indus-
try. Billboard or Radio & Records are examples of industry-oriented mag-
azines that cater to people working in the music industry. Depending on
the topic of your book, you may be able to target your potential readers
by advertising in this type of publication. You can purchase a directory
of industry-oriented publications from several different publishers.
 Newsletters: These publications are shorter than magazines in terms of
page count and typically focus on very specific topics. Newsletters are
typically an excellent way to reach extremely targeted audiences.
Newsletter Access (www.newsletteraccess.com) offers a free online
listing of over 5,000 regularly published newsletters.
Electronic media
Not all media outlets involve the printed word. You also can advertise with
radio and television:
 Radio: In addition to AM and FM radio stations throughout the country,
you can advertise nationally on radio networks or on syndicated radio
programs. There’s also advertising opportunities on the XM and Sirius
satellite radio networks.
296
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Radio advertising works but only with repetition and if the audience
you’re reaching is potentially interested in what you’re selling. The cost
of radio advertising varies greatly, based on the size of the audience, the
geographic area, the reach of the station, and the time of day the ad airs.
 Television: Network television advertising is very expensive, so as a self-
published author on a fixed budget, you may want to check into local or
regional television and cable TV advertising.
For television advertising to work, you need to produce the TV commer-
cial, and then pay television stations to air it. Just as with radio, TV
advertising works best with repetition. Running one 30-second ad on any
station or network won’t have a huge impact on book sales. Running the
same ad at least a few dozen times on one station greatly improves your
chances of selling books, but TV advertising is costly.
Online outlets
Online advertising can take on many forms. There’s traditional display
(banner) advertising, and keyword or search-based advertising, which has
become one of the most cost-effective and powerful ways to reach targeted
audiences through paid advertising. If you want to target your online-based
advertising to any audience you wish and set your own budget, try using a
service like Google AdWords (www.adwords.com) or Yahoo! Small Business
(smallbusiness.yahoo.com/marketing/sponsoredsearch.php).
Online advertising, specifically search marketing or keyword advertising, is a
great way to initially launch an ad campaign for your book. It’s easy and inex-
pensive, and you can measure the results quickly. For more about using the
power of the World Wide Web in promoting your book, see Chapter 21.
Other outlets
Advertising agencies and companies that rely on advertising to generate
sales have developed many innovative ways to get their messages out to the
public. Wouldn’t it be great to see your book advertised on the side of a bus
or on a giant billboard as your drive to work? Talk about an ego boost! Here
are some options to consider:
 Billboard and outdoor advertising: If you have the budget, advertising
on outdoor billboards, the sides of buses, and outdoor benches is
another viable way of advertising a book.
With this type of advertising, you’re paying to reach a general, mass-
market audience, so it may be suitable for advertising certain types of
books that have extremely broad appeal.
 Movie theater advertising: Advertising in movie theaters has become 
a popular and somewhat inexpensive way to capture the attention of
moviegoers who are a captive audience as they wait for their movie 
to begin. With movie theater advertising, you can target audiences of 
297
Chapter 20: Marketing Your Book with Paid Advertising and Promotional Tools

specific movies or focus your ads in theaters within specific geographic
locations. National Cinemedia (www.nationalcinemedia.com) is one
company that specializes in offering in-theater advertising opportunities.
Matching potential readers 
to specific media outlets
Paid advertising can be used effectively by a self-published author or publish-
ing company if you focus your advertising dollars and resources on niche
advertising: finding media outlets that specifically target only those people
you believe are potential readers for your book. Sure, it would be a great
boost to your ego to see a full-page ad for your book in the New York Times,
Time, or People, but for many self-published authors, this isn’t cost-effective
or practical.
Niche advertising may include advertising on specific (local or regional)
radio or television shows, in special interest magazines and newspapers,
and/or within specialized newsletters or Web sites. See the previous section
for details on different outlets for advertising.
For example: If you’ve written a cookbook that teaches the art of Italian cook-
ing, advertising in Time magazine or Business Week will be expensive and not
allow you to reach your intended audience. While some of these magazines’
readers may in fact be interested in Italian cooking, you pay to advertise to
everyone who reads those magazines, not just the select few who have an
interest in what you’re advertising. That’s a waste of money and resources.
Instead, consider finding a special interest cooking or lifestyle magazine to
advertise in, so you can better reach your intended audience. The circulation
of the special interest magazine may be only 5,000 to 10,000 people, as
opposed to several million, but you know the readers of the special interest
magazine are far more likely to buy your book.
By figuring out your book’s target audience (see Chapter 4 for details on how
to do this), you can do research to determine their buying and media habits.
Some of this research involves making educated guesses about the forms of
advertising that will allow you to reach the most people in your target audi-
ence for the least amount of money. For example, are they more apt to listen
to a talk radio station on their way to work or read a special interest maga-
zine during their free time?
298
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Obtaining advertising kits
After considering all possible advertising vehicles, choose a handful of what
you believe could be the most viable options and contact those media outlets
to request an advertising kit (also referred to as a media kit). This kit
includes detailed printed information about that media outlet, including its
audience and reach, the cost to advertise, the types of ads it accepts, and
other information you need to plan your advertising campaign.
Media kits are provided free of charge by the media outlet to potential adver-
tisers. To obtain a media kit, contact the media outlet’s advertising sales
department. By requesting a handful of media kits from competing media out-
lets, you can better target your advertising and choose the best advertising
opportunities, based on your budget (see the next section) and what you’re
trying to achieve.
As you read through the various media kits, you may see many technical
terms, which are helpful for you to understand. Advertopedia.com (www.
advertopedia.com/advertising-dictionary.htm) offers a free, online
advertising and marketing dictionary, which helps you decipher all the tech-
nical jargon related to advertising.
When you contact the advertising sales department at a media outlet, it’s the
salesperson’s job to sell you as much advertising as possible, at the highest
possible price. Make sure that promises are backed up with actual documen-
tation, based on past success stories from other advertisers. It’s okay to seek
out the advice of these advertising agencies in terms of how to best utilize
their media outlet to successfully sell your book, as long as you understand
their motivation.
Considering your budget
Depending on the readers you’re trying to reach and the advertising media
you plan to use, a successful advertising campaign can be launched with a
few hundred dollars or several million dollars.
As a self-published author, all the money you spend on advertising most likely
comes out of your pocket. Therefore, you need to determine, in advance, how
much you’re willing to spend and in what time frame (see Chapter 6 for more
information about sticking to a budget). Then you can figure out the best
advertising opportunities available to you.

Chapter 20: Marketing Your Book with Paid Advertising and Promotional Tools

You pay for advertising in print media outlets based on the size of your dis-
play ad or the number of words in your classified ad. For electronic media,
like radio and television, you buy time, usually in 30- or 60-second incre-
ments. With online advertising, you pay for impressions (the number of
people who see your ad) or click-through responses (the number of people
who click on your ad to visit your Web site). For specialty outlets like bill-
boards, you pay based on the placement of the billboard and the projected
number of impressions it’ll make.
Planning a Successful Ad Campaign
Developing a successful advertising campaign is a process with multiple
steps. It’s not something that can be thrown together haphazardly, especially
because you’re forking out your hard-earned money for this service. The
money you spend on advertising is an investment you’re making in the future
sale of your books. If the advertising works, you sell a lot of books and make
money. If the advertising campaign fails, you wasted the money you spent.
Unfortunately, there are many reasons why an ad campaign could fail. The
most common reasons are
 The ad was poorly written or designed and didn’t properly address the
needs and wants of its audience or didn’t capture their attention.
 The message you conveyed with your ad was unprofessional or lacked
credibility.
 The ad itself was good, but the media outlet you advertised in was inap-
propriate for the audience you were trying to reach.
 The timing or placement of your ad was bad.
 Your ad didn’t have enough repetition to properly capture the attention
of your intended audience.
 There is no market for or interest in what you’re advertising.
Developing effective advertising is a skill set that requires learning, research,
and experience. Don’t try to wing it! Before spending money on any type of
advertising, make sure that you know the following:
 Exactly what you’re getting
 Who you’re reaching
 When the ad appears
 The size or duration of the ad
 How often the ad will run
 What you anticipate the results to be

If you have the budget, seriously consider working with an experienced
advertising agency to help you design and place your ads effectively to
ensure that every dollar you spend on advertising helps you sell the most
number of books possible. (See the nearby sidebar “Throw me a pitch: Hiring
an advertising agency” for more information.)
In the following sections, I explain how to create an ad, time your campaign
wisely, and track the results of your ads to fine-tune your campaign.
To discover more about advertising techniques and trends, read current and
past issues of Advertising Age (www.advertisingage.com) and AdWeek
(www.adweek.com). These two industry magazines cover all aspects of the
advertising industry and are available from newsstands or via subscription.
Creating your ad
Assuming you’ve written or published a book you know has a viable market
and you understand exactly who your potential readers are, the next step is
to create an ad that captures their attention. In the following sections, I pro-
vide you with some tips and tricks on crafting effective ads.
301
Chapter 20: Marketing Your Book with Paid Advertising and Promotional Tools
Throw me a pitch: Hiring an advertising agency
Creating an effective advertising campaign
requires an understanding of how advertising
works, an intimate understanding of what you’re
trying to sell, and a strong knowledge about the
people you’re trying to reach. Working with a rep-
utable advertising agency to help you advertise
your book could be an extremely good investment.
An advertising agency has the following roles:
 Helps you determine the target audience for
your book
 Figures out how to reach your audience
 Creates an advertising campaign that fits
within your budget
 Deals with each media outlet directly to
coordinate your advertising
 Handles the creation or production of your
actual ads
Advertising agencies charge different fee struc-
tures, depending on the types of services
offered. Your best bet is to sit down with several
advertising agencies in your area and hear their
pitches. In those pitches, you need to look for
an understanding of your book and your target
audience and how the agency can best utilize
your available ad budget to reach this audience.
You can find advertising agencies listed in the
Yellow Pages, seek out a referral from someone
you know, or read agency profiles in publica-
tions like Advertising Age or AdWeek. You can
determine an agency’s competence based on
the work they’ve done for other clients.

Answering important questions about your book
Whichever advertising medium you ultimately use, the advertising message
you convey must quickly and powerfully answer the questions: who, what,
where, when, why, and how. At the same time, the message needs to focus on
the potential reader’s wants and needs.
While making sure that your ad appeals to your target audience, the ad must
also quickly answer a number of questions. Here are some of those questions:
 What are you offering? In this case, you’re offering a book. People need
to know that.
 What’s the book about? In one sentence or less, successfully and suc-
cinctly summarize what your book is all about.
 Who will be interested in reading it and why? Focus on what your
book’s target audience will want to know about your book.
 What does the book offer to its readers? Does your book offer exclu-
sive or valuable content? If so, your ad needs to bring this fact to the
attention of potential readers.
 What’s unique about your book? Focus on why someone should read
your book as opposed to another book on the same topic.
 How will readers benefit from reading your book? What will they
learn? Focus on the value or knowledge the reader will obtain and how
your book can help the reader.
 What information will readers obtain? List a few specific examples of
topics covered in the book. Give readers a taste of what they can expect.
 What problems can the book help solve? Be specific and address
issues or topics that relate directly to your intended audience. For exam-
ple, focus on how the book will help your readers overcome a problem.
 Why should someone buy your book right now? Create a sense of
urgency. Provide one or more reasons why the information in your book
should be obtained right away.
 Where can they obtain a copy of your book? Is the book “Available
now from bookstores everywhere!” or “Available exclusively at
www.[Web siteURL].com”? Don’t make potential readers search for your
book. Tell them exactly where they can purchase it right away.
 How much does the book cost? List the cover price of the book. If
you’ve already created a perceived value for the book’s content, poten-
tial readers should think they’re getting a bargain when they see how
much the book actually costs.
302
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

 Why should the reader trust you as an author? What makes you an
expert? List a few of your key credentials to impress potential readers.
This can help add to the book’s perceived value.
 Who else thinks your book is incredible? Many successful book ads
utilize excerpts from positive reviews, quotes from celebrities, or awards
the book has won.
And, of course, be sure to include basic details such as the book’s publisher,
author (that’s you!), ISBN, and Web site.
Making the most of your chosen medium
Whether you’re creating a display ad or a text-based classified ad for a print
publication, an audio ad for radio, or a video-based ad for television, you
need to use all the tools that particular advertising medium offers to achieve
the best possible results. For example:
 For classified advertising in print publications or text-based online ads,
you have the written word at your disposal. Your ability to create a power-
ful advertising message relies on how well you use the English language.
 When it comes to magazine advertising, you have the ability to use full-
color text and graphics to sell your book properly.
 If you’re radio advertising, you can use the spoken word, music, and
sound effects to communicate your sales message.
 With television advertising, use your intended audience’s ability to see,
hear, and read your message.
Generating a sense of urgency
The most powerful ads create a sense of urgency. You want the person who
sees or hears your ad to believe they must get their hands on your book
immediately. Creating a sense of urgency helps encourage the potential
reader to take immediate action, such as visiting a bookstore, calling a toll-
free number, or surfing a Web site to purchase your book.
One way to create a sense of urgency is to feature a special offer, such as
“Order online before a [insert date] and receive 20 percent off the cover
price!” People love to save money and receive special offers!
Pulling together text and graphics
After you determine what information needs to go within the ad, figure out
the best way to communicate that information, using powerful and attention-
getting language. Writing effective advertising copy is a skill that requires
training and practice, even for experienced writers and authors.
303
Chapter 20: Marketing Your Book with Paid Advertising and Promotional Tools

To convey your message quickly, use powerful words that create excitement,
demand, and urgency. You can find great tips for writing copy for ads and
other pieces in Writing Copy For Dummies (Wiley) by Jonathan Kranz.
Whenever you’re advertising in any type of media that allows for visuals, be
sure that your book’s cover is prominently displayed. People need to know
exactly what the book looks like, so they can find it easily on a bookstore’s
shelves. The cover of your book should be designed to sell itself. (See
Chapter 9 for details on putting together an attractive book cover.)
You have only a few seconds to make a positive impression. For a display ad,
the headline and the graphics must jump off the page at the reader. The sample
book ad in Figure 20-1 uses a bold headline to quickly attract a specific audi-
ence’s attention (in this case, single guys), and then asks a question to further
engage the reader. The book’s cover is prominently displayed. The remaining
text conveys the relevant information about the book and provides details
about its content.
Take a look at ads for other books. Examine the format, the wording used,
and the approaches the various ads take. Determine what approach mostly
likely works with your book and try to use those same advertising tech-
niques, assuming they apply to your book and your potential audience.

Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Checking over your ad
Even if you have a professional graphic designer or advertising agency write
and design your ad, it’s always a good idea to have multiple people proofread
it to ensure that it’s error free and properly gets your message across in the
most efficient way possible. Consider showing the ad to several random
people (friends, coworkers, relatives, and so on) and ask for the first impres-
sion of the ad to see if it has the desired impact.
Timing your campaign
Timing is a critical component for any ad campaign. If your ads start running
too early, before the book is published and readily available, people won’t be
able to find it right away and could forget about it. Ideally, you want ads for
your book to run at the same time the book is available, so when readers
order a copy, they can expect to receive it quickly, or they can go to the book-
store and purchase a copy right away.
Proper timing of your paid advertising campaign means coordinating the ads
to run around the same time as the free publicity you generate (see Chapters
18 and 19 for more about publicity), as well as in conjunction with any other
marketing and promotional activities you’re planning. Ideally, readers should
be exposed to as many impressions of your book as possible.
As you decide where to place your ads, consider lead times carefully. In terms
of print publications, don’t get caught up on issue dates. Focus on the street
date for each issue. For example, a magazine with an October 2006 issue date
often hits newsstands and is mailed to subscribers in early September.
Tracking the results of your ads
It’s important to know if the ads you’re running are effective and generating
the desired response rates. Therefore, it’s important to carefully track what
ads are running, where they’re running, and what the response is from them.
This tracking system helps you fine-tune your advertising on an ongoing basis,
improve the message, and focus more heavily on the aspects of the paid
advertising campaign that are working well. For instance, if you see one ad in a
specific magazine or newspaper isn’t generating a good response, but your
online campaign is generating excellent results, you can reconfigure your
budget to put more of an emphasis on the types of advertising that work.
Tracking online ads is extremely simple because you’re often provided with
useful tools, such as Web site traffic reports and click-through statistics. The
Web master of the site you advertise on often provides these statistics. The
Web hosting service for your Web site can also help you track visitors to your
site (see Chapter 21 for more about setting up a Web site).
305
Chapter 20: Marketing Your Book with Paid Advertising and Promotional Tools

Television and radio ads are relatively easy to track as well. You know when
an ad runs because you can either pay for specific air times or have your ad
run in a random rotation during a specific time period. If you choose the
latter (which is cheaper), the TV or radio station tells you exactly when your
ad(s) ran. You can then quickly track the results, based on the number of
calls, Web site hits, or orders you receive within minutes after the ad(s) air.
Print ads are harder to track because people see them over extended time;
the same goes for specialty ads like billboards. If you’re advertising in a
monthly magazine, for example, you’re apt to receive responses from that ad
throughout the entire month. For this type of ad, it’s useful to include some
type of special tracking code for orders. To do this, you can use a unique Web
site URL or a toll-free phone number in each ad, or display a code in the ad
and ask customers for that code when they place their order.
Effectively Using Promotional Materials
In addition to paid advertising there are a wide range of promotional materi-
als you can use to help spread the word about your new book. If you have an
easy and inexpensive way to distribute these materials, you may experience
even greater sales success. In the following sections, I cover several different
promotional tools: bookmarks, postcards, book excerpts, and book displays.
Bookmarks
Full-color, 2-x-6-inch bookmarks are an ideal and extremely inexpensive way
to promote your book. These promotional items can be given away at book-
stores, libraries, author appearances (see Chapter 19), or anyplace where
you can obtain permission to distribute them to large numbers of people.
For under $250, you can have several thousand promotional bookmarks
printed. Design the bookmarks yourself with any graphics program, or have
the printing company you use handle the graphic design work on your behalf
(which often costs extra.) Whether you’re having full-color bookmarks or
postcards printed (see the next section for more about postcards), find a
competitively priced printer that offers professional offset printing, using
ultra-bright, 130-pound paper with 16-point coating (and/or glossy spot UV
coating), plus high-resolution, photo-quality, 200-line screen printing (at 2400
dpi), with precise cutting. These specs ensure that the items turn out looking
highly professional.
Getz Color Graphics is a full-service printer that specializes in inexpensively
producing full-color promotional materials, such as bookmarks and post-
cards. The company charges $220 for 5,000 full-color bookmarks and has
306
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

extensive experience working with authors and publishers. You can contact
the company at (800) 562-7052 or visit the Web site at www.getzcolor.com.
Promotional bookmarks are just like print ads for your book (see “Creating
your ad,” earlier in this chapter for details). The front and back of the book-
mark both serve a purpose:
 The front of the bookmark: The front design includes the following:
• The cover artwork for your book
• The title and subtitle using the largest font and type size possible
• The book’s publisher, author, ISBN, and cover price
• The Web site along with text stating exactly where the book can be
purchased (you may choose to place purchase info on the back)
 The back of the bookmark: The back can be printed in black and white.
Use this area to describe the book in greater detail and who the book
appeals to. Be as succinct as possible with the text you use.
Check out a sample bookmark in Figure 20-2 (the front of the bookmark is on
the left; the back is on the right). On the front, the book’s cover is displayed
in full color, and it’s big enough to see all of the detail. The headline brings
the reader’s attention to what the book is about and then provides details
about the author, publisher, ISBN, cost, and publication date. At the bottom,
the author’s Web site is clearly displayed so books can be ordered. The back
of the bookmark provides additional reasons why someone will want to read
the book and creates perceived value. It also mentions exactly where the
book can be purchased.
Postcards
Like bookmarks (see the previous section), full-color postcards are an excel-
lent way to promote your book at bookstores, libraries, author appearances,
and other events. Having 3-x-5-, 4-x-6-, or 5-x-7-inch postcards printed is inex-
pensive when compared to other forms of advertising. The cost is under $100
for at least 1,000 full-color postcards. Prices vary based on the quantity you
publish and the printing company you use.
The benefit to using postcards over bookmarks as a promotional tool is that
you have more space for your advertising message and they can be mailed,
allowing you to target a specific audience through direct mailing. In addition
to mailing promotional postcards to friends, family, coworkers, clients, and
customers, you can purchase a mailing list comprised of people in your target
audience and send out direct mailings to them for less money in postage than
sending a first-class letter. (See Chapter 15 for more about mailing lists.)
307
Chapter 20: Marketing Your Book with Paid Advertising and Promotional Tools

Mailing each postcard costs 24 cents. So, for $240 in postage (based on
January 2006 postage rates), you can send out a mailing of 1,000 postcards.
Be sure to calculate the cost of printing the postcards and purchasing a mail-
ing list when you’re figuring your budget.
The content of a promotional postcard should be virtually identical to what
you include on a bookmark, only you have more space to get your message
across. Instead of cluttering the postcard with more information, use large
font sizes and graphics. (Don’t forget to leave room on the back of the post-
card for the recipient’s address and the postage stamp.) Check out a sample
postcard in Figure 21-3.

Overnight Prints offers inexpensive full-color printing for your postcards. You
can order 1,000 postcards (4-x-6-inch size) online from the company’s Web
site, for under $49. Contact Overnight Prints at (888) 677-2000 or visit the
Web site at www.overnightprints.com.
Excerpts from your book
One fun way to get people interested in reading your book is to offer them a
free sample of it. You can create a free, downloadable PDF file and make it
available on your Web site (see Chapter 21) and from online booksellers, like
Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com (see Chapter 14). You can also have
excerpts printed as booklets or mini-books and distribute them at author
appearances, trade shows, or anyplace else where you can distribute printed
materials to the masses.
Excerpts are good, particularly for fiction, for drawing the reader into the
story and then encouraging them to actually purchase and read the entire
book. For nonfiction, offering an excerpt is always helpful, but a well-written
and designed piece of promotional material or ad potentially sells the book
just as well to someone who’s interested in the topic.
Book displays
As a publisher looking to make a positive and professional impression on
booksellers and retail stores that are potentially interested in selling your
book, offering a free, cardboard floor or countertop display when they pur-
chase a specific number of books is often a good sales incentive. Plus, if
you’re promoting your book at appearances or trade shows, a customized
retail display helps enhance your professional image.
Corrugated cardboard floor or countertop book displays come in a wide
range of configurations, which you select based on the trim size of your 
book and the number of books you want the display to hold. These card-
board displays can be custom-designed, or you can have stock displays
custom-imprinted, based on your needs. As with any type of printing 
and manufacturing process, the more units you order, the cheaper each 
display is.
310
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

To find companies that manufacture similar displays, use the search phrase
book displays on any Internet search engine. But here are a couple of my
favorites:
 City Diecutting, Inc. is one of many companies that manufactures
custom-designed and custom-imprinted, cardboard countertop and floor
displays for books. Depending on size and quantity, countertop displays
cost under $8 each and are ideal for retail store displays. Contact the
company at www.bookdisplays.com.
 Displays To Go (www.displaystogo.com) offers a selection of wire
book displays in a wide range of sizes and configurations. These dis-
plays are ideal for retail or tradeshow settings.

Maximizing Your Marketing
Power in Cyberspace
In This Chapter
 Using the power of the Web to market your book
 Steering traffic to your site
 Taking advantage of engaging online techniques
T
hanks to the incredible popularity and broad reach of the Internet, mar-
keting a self-published book has never been easier or more cost effective.
Although most self-published authors should take advantage of a comprehen-
sive public relations campaign and paid advertising to properly promote
their book (see Chapters 18 to 20 for details on these methods), the Internet
offers a variety of ways to promote and directly sell books in conjunction
with other methods.
Many self-published books are targeted to a niche market. The Internet 
offers a relatively easy and inexpensive way to target those niche audiences.
This chapter focuses on how to use the Internet successfully to promote 
your book.
The Internet is a powerful marketing and sales tool. Using the Web effectively
requires a tremendous amount of planning and creativity. After you decide
how to use the Internet, you should develop a well-thought-out plan to ensure
that your ideas are implemented and managed properly over the long term.
After you create a Web site or blog, for example, update and maintain it regu-
larly. If you accept orders for your book online, fill those orders promptly. This
process requires a time commitment. As you investigate the various technolo-
gies available to you, determine how you can best use them to reach your
target audience and sell books.

Caught in the Web: Building a
Promotional Site for Your Book
Simply publishing a book is only one step in actually being successful. After
you have books available to sell, promoting, marketing, and advertising the
book to its intended audience is crucial. Online-based marketing should be
just one facet of your book’s overall marketing, public relations, and advertis-
ing campaign. Use all the tools and resources at your disposal to reach your
book’s target market in as many ways as possible.
In the following sections, I explain the benefits of using a promotional Web
site, the elements that make up a Web site, and the options you have for cre-
ating a Web site.
Why use a Web site to market your book?
Using the Internet as a powerful marketing tool has many benefits:
 You have the ability to carefully target your marketing efforts and focus
exclusively on reaching your book’s intended audience. For more about
steering target readers to your site, see “If You Build It, Will They Come?
Generating Traffic to Your Web Site,” later in this chapter.
 The various online marketing tools available are inexpensive, easy to uti-
lize, and require a very short lead time (unlike paid advertising or other
types of marketing). For example, when you send out an e-mail message
to dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of targeted recipients, it’s
received within seconds.
 You’re able to distribute your book’s marketing message using text,
graphics, photographs, animation, sound effects, spoken audio, and
even video when you use a Web site, free downloads, e-mail, a blog,
and/or a Podcast as a marketing tool (see “Adding Extra Bells and
Whistles” later in this chapter for details).
 Your message can be changed instantly. It’s possible to make edits to a
Web site and publish it in minutes.
There aren’t many disadvantages to using a Web site for your book unless the
site you create is extremely unprofessional and takes away from the credibil-
ity of the book itself.
This chapter explores many ways of using the Internet as a marketing tool.
Based on your budget, technical knowledge, and goals, use some or all of the
online resources available to help you promote and sell the maximum
number of books possible. Don’t just rely on one or two online marketing
techniques.
314
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

What are the elements of a Web site?
Web sites are typically divided into individual pages, which are accessed by
people who surf the Web by clicking on links or menu options. Keep the
design of your book’s Web site straightforward, but incorporate the following
elements:
 Author appearances: If you’re participating in a book tour, author sign-
ings, or appearances to promote your book, list the dates and details on
this page. (See Chapter 19 for more about appearances.)
 Author’s bio: Tell your Web site’s visitors about who you are, what your
experience is, and how you gained your expertise. It’s a good idea to dis-
play your photo to help introduce yourself to readers. Some (potential)
readers enjoy seeing who has written the book they plan to read. It can
help readers better relate to the material. (See Chapter 18 for details
about author bios and photos.)
 Contact page: Provide a way for readers, fans, booksellers, the media,
and publishing industry professionals to reach you.
 Free downloadable excerpt: One way to capture the attention of read-
ers is to offer them a free preview of your book in the form of an excerpt
or sample chapter. Create a downloadable PDF file of a chapter and
allow visitors to download it for free. (See Chapter 8 for details about
how to create a downloadable PDF file using Adobe Acrobat software.)
When you promote your book on a radio or TV show to entice people to
visit your Web site, offer them something of value for free:
• A chapter download of your book
• A special report that’s not included in your book
• Online excerpts, which make it possible to give readers brief sec-
tions of several chapters
 Frequently asked questions (FAQ): This section can be used to answer
questions about you, your book, your book’s topic, and information for
potential readers. A FAQ section is typically created in a question and
answer format, with a list of the questions included displayed at the top
of the document or page for easy reference.
 Home page: Think of this page as a promotional brochure for your book.
Describe your book in detail. Answer questions like: What’s it about?
Who should read it? What sets it apart from other books? Where is it
available? How much it costs? Be sure to prominently display your
book’s full-color cover on this page and include prominently displayed
links to the other pages of your site. Need help creating content for this
page? Utilize the promotional materials you’ve already created (or plan
to create) for your book (see Chapters 18 and 20 for more info).
315
Chapter 21: Maximizing Your Marketing Power in Cyberspace

 Press room: Create an area where visitors, especially the media, can
download or view press releases pertaining to your book (see Chapter
18 for more about press releases).
 Reviews, endorsements, and testimonials: Offer quotes from published
reviews, celebrities, and/or readers that relate directly to your book.
 Shopping cart/Order now: Allow potential readers to pre-order or order
your book online, either directly from your Web site or from an online
bookseller, like Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble.com. (See Chapter 16 for
more about taking orders for your book; check out Chapter 14 for more
about online booksellers.)
What’s another item you can sell on your Web site? Try eBooks! For
more details on eBooks, see Chapter 12.
Many people use a Web site to promote themselves as authors and experts 
as well as announce new self-published books. Bestselling author Jamise L.
Dames originally launched her Web site (www.jamiseldames.com), shown
in Figure 21-1, to promote her first self-published novel, “Momma’s Baby
Daddy’s Maybe.” After selling more than 25,000 copies herself, within a year
she sold the rights to her book to Simon & Schuster (see Chapter 17 for more
about selling your book to a major publisher). Jamise now uses her Web site
to promote all her books and her career as a public speaker.

Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

When designing your Web site and creating content for it, first visit several
other Web sites developed by authors and publishers. See what’s already been
done well and learn from other people’s mistakes. Don’t copy other people’s
Web sites (because this infringes on their copyrights). Instead, gather ideas
for your Web site’s overall design, layout, appearance, and content.
How can you create a Web site?
Before your book even gets published, invest the time and effort into devel-
oping a promotional Web site for it. This process can begin as soon as you
have a concrete idea of what your book is about, who its target audience is,
and what content it contains. Ideally, your Web site should have an ordering
function or at least point potential readers directly to online bookstores,
where they can place their orders for your book. Meanwhile, all of your other
marketing, public relations, and advertising efforts should direct people to
your book’s Web site to obtain more information. The sooner you publish
your Web site and make it available on the Web, the better chance you have
of getting it established and listed with the various search engines (a process
that can take weeks or months).
The goal of your book’s Web site is to inform potential readers and the media
about the publication of your book and to entice them to order a copy. The
Web site you create must look professional and offer the information about
your book that potential readers want and need.
Many companies can create and host a Web site inexpensively. These ser-
vices use online-based Web site design and creation tools that are extremely
simple to use. If you hire a professional Web designer to create a site for you,
this route is the easiest. You can also create a Web site on your own because
it has never been easier, even if you have no programming knowledge what-
soever. Check out Building a Web Site For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) by
David A. Crowder. I cover both options in the following sections.

Hiring a professional Web site designer
A more expensive option for creating a Web site is to hire a professional Web
site designer and hosting company. Hiring a company like this virtually guar-
antees that your Web site looks professional, and it allows you to incorporate
animation, audio, video, or other elements into your site without having to
teach yourself Web site programming. A professional Web site designer can
also include a shopping cart module to your site, so you can sell books and
other products with ease.
The cost of a Web site designer/programmer can vary dramatically. Plan on
spending anywhere from $500 to $3,000 for a professionally designed Web
site, depending on the time required to design the site and functionality you
desire. Functionality refers to the specific features you add to your site,
whether it’s a shopping cart, interactive questionnaire, animation, or other
elements to make it more appealing to visitors.
Keep in mind that after your site is designed, it still needs to be maintained.
This job can mean an ongoing cost, unless you have the tools and skill to
handle updates yourself. If you have the professionals do it, you’re also
responsible for ongoing Web site hosting charges from the Internet Service
Provider (ISP) that hosts your site.
Before hiring someone to develop your site, evaluate the portfolio of work,
and ensure that the person you’re interested in working with is capable of
developing a Web site that meets your needs. Also, surf the Web and find
sites you really like in terms of design and functionality. Show these sites to
your designer for a better idea of what you’re looking for. The more informa-
tion you provide, the easier creating your Web site can be. Even if you don’t
have artistic ability, feel free to sketch out ideas for your Web site and share
them with your designer. Communicating clearly is important, and it may
save you time and money.
Here are a few places to find the best Web designer for your needs:
 Referrals
 The Yellow Pages
 Services like Elance (www.elance.com)
 Your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
 Surf the Web
Looking around the Internet for Web sites you really like may help you find a
designer. At the bottom of the Web site, typically near the copyright informa-
tion, you may find a link to the company that designed the site (if it was cre-
ated by an independent firm as opposed to an in-house staff). Contact the
design companies for Web sites you like or that are similar to what you envi-
sion needing for you site.

If You Build It, Will They Come?
Generating Traffic to Your Web Site
Millions of Web sites exist in cyberspace today and each offers content in an
effort to attract people to that site. Just publishing a Web site isn’t enough to
ensure that people will visit it. It’s vital that you inform people of the site’s
existence.
Developing a Web site to promote an author and a book has become com-
monplace. Readers expect to be able to find a Web site pertaining to a book
and often seek out that Web site before purchasing or reading the book.
Therefore, it’s important to make sure that your Web site is easy to find.
You can promote your book exclusively to the people you know will be inter-
ested in it, often for a fraction of what it would cost you to use other forms of
media, like radio, television, billboards, direct mail, newspapers, or maga-
zines. There are many ways of generating such targeted traffic to your Web
site. The following sections cover a few common ways.
Choosing an easy-to-remember address
and mentioning it everywhere
Your Web site’s URL is its address on the Web. For example, the address may
look like this: www.[AuthorsName].com or www.[YourBookTitle].com.
Make sure that the domain name you choose is obvious so people can find
your site easily.
Depending on what you actually wind up doing with your Web site(s), having
multiple domain names can be useful. The Web site with the author’s name as
the URL can be used to promote the author and his/her career, including all
their books and work. If you establish a publishing company (see Chapter 6
for details), the publishing company’s Web site can be used specifically to
promote each book title and accept online orders for the book(s).
To register a domain name, go online and visit a domain registrar site such as
www.godaddy.com. The process takes just a few minutes and requires an
annual registration fee. Make sure to use the company’s full name in the Web
site address: Acme Publishing would be www.AcmePublishing.com. Also,
be sure to register the author’s full name as a Web site domain name if you’re
going to use a site to promote an author. For example, my Web site URL is
www.JasonRich.com.
319
Chapter 21: Maximizing Your Marketing Power in Cyberspace

Within your book and within all the marketing and promotional materials,
always display your Web site’s URL prominently. For example:
 Display your Web site’s URL on your business cards and company 
letterhead.
 If you plan to distribute press releases to the media announcing your
book (see Chapter 18), be sure to include the Web site’s URL within the
press release.
 Whenever you’re invited to be a guest on a radio or television show to
promote your book (see Chapter 19 for more about interviews and
author appearances), always mention the Web site two or three times.
 When being interviewed for a newspaper or magazine article, specifically
ask the reporter to include your Web site address within the article.
 When lecturing, participating in book signings, or making public appear-
ances as an author, make sure that all attendees know about your Web
site.
 Display the Web site’s URL in all paid advertising for the book (see
Chapter 20), such as in newspaper and magazine ads.
 If you distribute promotional bookmarks or postcards announcing the
publication of your book (see Chapter 20), be sure your Web site’s URL
is displayed clearly on them.
Registering your site with search 
engines and Web directories
Virtually all Web surfers begin each journey into cyberspace using a popular
search engine or Web directory, such as Google (www.google.com) or
Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com). In order to reach these Web surfers looking for
information about your book’s topic, be sure to list your Web site on at least
the most popular Internet search engines.
To do this, you can either visit each site separately or follow the directions
for listing a new site (which is typically free), or you can pay a service to list
your site with dozens of the popular search engines on your behalf. These
services often offer Search Engine Optimization, which means they list your
site and take steps to ensure that your site is among the first to be listed for
specific search terms or phrases that you predetermine. You can find a
Search Engine Optimization service by using any search engine. It’s also a
service that most Web site development companies provide for an additional
fee. The benefit to using this type of service is that they know how to get
sites listed quickly. Plus, it saves you time. The cost can be anywhere from
$25 to several hundred dollars, depending on the services offered.
320
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Using keyword marketing
Keyword marketing, also referred to as search marketing, has become a pow-
erful and inexpensive way to advertise any Web site online. You want to
create a short, text-based online ad that displayed every time a surfer enters
a search phrase. The online ad should be a headline with two short lines of
text. Two companies that can help you create your content include
 Yahoo! Small Business: Web site smallbusiness.yahoo.com/
marketing/sponsoredsearch.php
 Google AdWords: Web site adwords.google.com/select
How do these services work? Well, you create the list of keywords and search
phrases you believe best describe your Web site and then pay a small fee
each time your ad is displayed and someone actually clicks on the link to
visit your Web site.
Keyword marketing is extremely cost effective and requires only a very small
financial investment (under $50) to get started. This way of generating Web
site traffic has become a far more powerful form of advertising than online
banner advertising.
Are you wondering what the benefits are? Keyword advertising has many:
 It launches within minutes and begins generating results quickly.
 The campaign can be modified in real time to ensure the best results.
 You can target a variety of different potential audiences for your book
using several keyword marketing campaigns simultaneously and con-
tinue to tweak your list of keywords that generate the most traffic.
 You can spend as much or as little money as you want to generate traffic
to your Web site.
Linking up with affiliate marketing
By signing up with an affiliate marketing service, you invite other Web site
operators (who become your affiliates) to display ads or links to your site on
their Web sites. You don’t pay upfront for this advertising. Instead, every time
someone either clicks a link to visit your site or clicks a link and places an
order from your site, you pay that affiliate a predetermined fee. The affiliate
marketing service acts as the middle man, tracks traffic, and handles the nec-
essary accounting on your behalf. The cost-per-click ranges from a fraction of
one cent to several dollars, depending on a variety of factors, including how
targeted the Web surfers are.
321
Chapter 21: Maximizing Your Marketing Power in Cyberspace

Thousands of well-established companies, as well as small online business
operators and self-published authors, use affiliate marketing to generate traf-
fic to their sites. For a list of companies that manage affiliate marketing pro-
grams on behalf of Web masters, check out the following Web site: www.web
affiliatesdirectory.com/affiliate_networks_list.html.
Try out these three companies that manage Affiliate Marketing programs on
behalf of Web masters:
 LinkShare (www.linkshare.com)
 ClickExchange (www.clickexchange.com)
 eAdExchange (www.eAdExchange.com)
Becoming an active online participant
As an author looking to promote your book, if you become active online, you
may be able to get the word out about you and your book. Here are a few
ways to spread the news:
 Chat rooms, forums, and message boards: While blatantly promoting
your book may be frowned upon (because you don’t want to sound to
self-serving), offer advice, comments, ideas, or recommendations as part
of your postings and interaction, and then casually mention your book
and Web site.
Find these forums through online searches. Use the topic of your book,
for example, as the search phrase. If you’re a member of America Online,
click the Community icon.
 Write reviews: Visit online booksellers’ Web sites, and write reviews 
of other people’s books (that relate to your area of expertise or your
book’s topic). In your reviews, you can casually promote yourself 
and your book in the process. (See Chapter 14 for more details about
reviewing books on online booksellers’ sites.)
Adding Extra Bells and Whistles
Internet technology is always evolving. Simple text-based Web sites can be a
powerful marketing tool for a book; however, many new technologies now
exist that can be inexpensively incorporated into a Web site to make it more
engaging and interactive.
The following sections cover a few features, using some of the latest Internet
technologies that you can incorporate into your Web site to improve its abil-
ity to promote and sell your book.
322
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

The first and foremost objective of your Web site and online marketing efforts
is to sell your book and promote yourself as an author. Adding fancy bells
and whistles, such as visually stunning animations, look great, but they’re not
always necessary.
Choosing opt-in mailing lists 
and electronic newsletters
Allowing your Web site’s visitors to opt in or subscribe to a mailing list allows
you to communicate with those people via e-mail. Many authors and publish-
ing companies find it extremely beneficial to send weekly or monthly e-mails
to people on their mailing list. This benefits you by reminding people about
your book’s existence and providing additional marketing messages on an
ongoing basis. For example, you can provide a few informative articles relat-
ing to the topic of your book but also include a promotional message or ad
about your book as part of the newsletter.
An opt-in mailing list for e-mail is very different from spam. Spam is unso-
licited e-mail sent out without the recipient’s permission. Avoid using spam 
to market, promote, and sell your book. Uninvited solicitation can damage
your credibility and annoy potential readers.
An electronic newsletter can be as short as one page and contain one or more
informative articles on a topic that’s related to your book and that readers
perceive as valuable and interesting. For example, if you’ve written a how-to
book, write an article that lists the top ten tips or common mistakes to avoid.
The company you use to develop and/or host your Web site can help you
incorporate an online mailing list and related database. See “How can you
create a Web site?” earlier in this chapter for more about finding a company
to build your site.
Creating an author’s blog
Blogging has become a popular and informal way for people to publish their
knowledge, thoughts, advice, and opinions on the Internet. A blog is like an
electronic diary that’s put on the Web and made available for anyone to read.
A blog can incorporate text, graphics, photos, and other digital elements.
Many authors create blogs as an informal way to communicate with their
readers regularly. Blogging can be used to promote your book but also to
help you establish yourself as an expert in your field.
323
Chapter 21: Maximizing Your Marketing Power in Cyberspace

Creating a blog that’s tied to your Web site is easy. Many free and inexpensive
services exist that you can use to create and maintain a blog. These services
require no programming and are extremely easy to use. In fact, after your text
is written, you can create and update your blog in minutes.
Some blogging services create separate URLs for blogs. If this is the case, be
sure to provide a link from your main Web site to your blog, so people can
easily find and access it. For example, my Web site is www.JasonRich.com,
but, my blog is jasonrich.blogspot.com. When you read the blog, you
find numerous links back to my Web site (and vice versa).
Many authors have discovered that updating their blog on a weekly or
monthly basis is a great way to develop a following and inform potential 
readers about their book(s).
Figure 21-2 shows my own blog, found at jasonrich.blogspot.com. On it,
you find information about some of my books and are able to chit-chat about
some of the book projects I’m currently working on. The blog is written in an
informal style, yet it provides readers with detailed information about my
current and upcoming books.

Producing a podcast
A podcast is like a prerecorded radio program that can be downloaded and
listened to, for free, using any iPod or compatible MP3 player (including com-
puters that can play audio files). A podcast can be an audio-based blog or
produced to sound like a professional radio show.
The benefit to a podcast is that you can use audio to generate content of
interest to listeners and potential readers of your book. This means that in
addition to speaking yourself, you can interview other people, and use music
and sound effects to capture the attention of your audience.
A podcast can be recorded by anyone and made available online, through
www.itunes.com, from your Web site, or from a growing number of podcast
libraries.
Recording and publishing a podcast is relatively easy when you use special-
ized software, such as GarageBand or QuickTime Pro for Macs or ePodcast
Producer for PCs (www.industrialaudiosoftware.com). To understand
how to produce a podcast, check out these Web sites:
 www.podcasting.com
 www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts
 www.podcast.net
 www.pod101.com
You also can pick up a copy of Podcasting For Dummies (Wiley) by Tee Morris
and Evo Terra.
Another way to drive traffic to your Web site and promote your book at the
same time is to get your book reviewed on other people’s podcasts. Go to any
blog or podcast directory (such as iTunes) and use the search phrase book
reviews to find which blogs and/or podcasts to submit your book to in order
to get it reviewed.
325
Chapter 21: Maximizing Your Marketing Power in Cyberspace

Hosting an online chat
Just as being a guest on a radio or television show is a great way to promote
your book, being a guest on an online chat can be equally productive in
terms of selling books. Services like America Online and MSN constantly host
live chats with authors and celebrity guests. Plus, you can host your own
chats anytime on these and other services. It’s even possible to create and
host chats from your own Web site.
Online chats are a way for you to communicate with people in real time.
E-mail, Web sites, and blogs, require you to publish information for people to
read and access later. Online chats are interactive, so people can ask you
questions and you can respond instantly. If you want to host your own online
chats from your Web site, contact your Web site designer or ISP about adding
this functionality to your site. Otherwise, you can work with an existing
online chat service or agree to be a guest on other chat sites.

Expanding Your Income with 
Spin-Off Products and Services
In This Chapter
 Looking at important issues before you spin off
 Building products based on your book
 Providing teaching, consulting, and other services
C
ongratulations! You’ve published your book and become an author. But
as you may have discovered, the profit potential from selling your book
is somewhat limited, mainly because of the relatively low cover price of the
book. For most self-published authors, simply publishing and selling a single
book isn’t an effective get-rich-quick scheme, nor does it allow them to earn a
full-time living.
By positioning yourself as an expert in your field, however, you can be hired
as a lecturer, instructor, or consultant and potentially earn several hundred
dollars per hour (or more). You can also create spin-off products like DVDs or
multimedia instructional programs with much higher price tags than the
cover price for your book. Your book then can be bundled with these spin-off
products and help further boost your credibility.
In this chapter, you discover ways to use your newfound credibility as a pub-
lished author, not just to sell books, but to create higher-priced spin-off prod-
ucts and services that can boost your revenue by allowing you to repackage
and expand on the content in your book.
Most of the time, nonfiction books lend themselves better to spin-off prod-
ucts, and authors of nonfiction books are in higher demand as speakers, 
freelancers, and consultants.

Considering a Few Important Points
Before You Start Down the Spin-Off Road
Creating spin-off products in conjunction with your book can help you gener-
ate more revenue over the long term, but initially, doing so requires a signifi-
cant time and financial investment to develop the products and then properly
market and distribute them. You also need to make sure that you choose the
right products and services for you and your book. I cover both topics in the
following sections.
What kind of investment 
do you need to make?
Just as you invested the time and money needed to self-publish your book
and properly market and promote it, unless you sell the subsidiary rights for
your book to another company (see Chapter 17 for more information), an
additional investment is needed to develop and sell spin-off products. The
goal is to target the audience you’ve already created for your book and sell
those same people (as well as new customers) products and services that
relate to your book or its topic.
The actual financial and time investment required depend on the type of
products and services you produce.
 For example: While you could record, duplicate, package, distribute, and
market a CD-based audio book for under $5,000, producing a DVD or
video can cost up to $50,000.
 The time it takes to develop and manufacture spin-off products depends
on a wide range of factors. Typically, each new project takes weeks or
months.
Simply publishing your book isn’t enough to make it successful. The book
needs to be properly marketed, distributed, and sold. The same holds true
for any spin-off products you create. Before investing the money to produce
any type of product, be sure that you’re able to market it to your intended
audience and are able to generate enough sales not only to recoup your
investment but also to make an ongoing profit. See Chapter 20 to find out the
basics of marketing; you also can check out Marketing For Dummies, 2nd
Edition (Wiley) by Alexander Hiam.
328
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Unless you have a massive budget and the vast resources you need to market
your products, start off small and build your product line as demand dictates
and new opportunities arise.
Which products and services 
are right for you?
If you possess knowledge and expertise that others may benefit and profit
from, people are likely to pay for that information in whatever form it’s made
available — a book, DVD, audio book, a live seminar, or a workshop. Having
written a full-length book, you clearly have information to share with others.
Now that your book has been published, use your business savvy, marketing
skills, and creativity to develop new ways to package and sell your informa-
tion, knowledge, and experience.
As you develop and produce spin-off products that are related to your book
and its content, be realistic. If you have no on-camera experience and lack
the personality, looks, and the voice to star in your own DVD, don’t waste
your time and money developing a product that ultimately looks unprofes-
sional and that could hurt your credibility. Furthermore, if you’re extremely
uncomfortable speaking in front of crowds, don’t pursue public speaking
opportunities until you’ve mastered the required skills and confidence.
Instead, focus on your own strengths and showcase them in whatever spin-
off products you develop and market.
Developing Creative Ways to 
Repackage Your Content
Taking the same information that’s in your book and adapting it to other
media allows you to use visuals, audio, and more text to create an even
better value. When you wrote your book, you were confined to using just the
written word and potentially a few photographs or illustrations. Tap your 
creativity and come up with a handful of ways to repackage or rework your
book’s material:
 If your book featured interviews with experts, in the audio or video
adaptation of your book, you could feature those same people, allowing
your audience to actually hear or see the interviews.
329
Chapter 22: Expanding Your Income with Spin-Off Products and Services

 When adapting content from your book, build on that content and offer
something new. Provide additional or expanded examples, new statis-
tics, updated information, or other content not originally included in
your book. This helps create a higher perceived value for the new prod-
ucts you’re creating, especially among people who have already read
your book and want more.
I cover your options, along with the partners you need to create and distrib-
ute products, in the following sections.
Surveying potential products
Finding innovative ways to repackage the content in your book and create
new types of products is all about creativity. The types of spin-off products
that are viable depend a lot on the type of book you’ve written and its
intended audience. While a novel can potentially be developed into an audio
book or even a computer game, products based around a work of nonfiction
can be transformed into instructional videos or DVDs, audio books, or inter-
active multimedia applications. In the following sections, I cover several vari-
eties of spin-off product formats.
When deciding how to cater to your potential audience and repackage the
material in your book, consider the habits of your target audience and how
you can utilize the latest technologies to best communicate with those people.
See Chapter 4 for information about determining your target audience.
Audio books
Almost any type of book can be produced into an audio book. However,
before investing the time and money into creating this type of product, deter-
mine if the type of book you’ve written is appealing in audio form. In reality,
you sell about one audio version of your book for every ten printed copies.
This statistic should help you determine if there’s a market for an audio adap-
tation of your book. Ask yourself this: Would someone potentially learn more
or be better entertained by hearing your book as opposed to reading it? If so,
would they be willing to pay extra for an audio book?
Audio books can be produced in a variety of formats:
 Cassette
 Compact Disc (CD)
 Downloadable digital files (such as MP3s)
 Streaming audio files, playable via the Internet
330
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Each of these audio formats requires a slightly different production, duplica-
tion, and distribution process. In the past, people listened to CD or audiocas-
settes, but today, millions of people have Apple iPods and other types of MP3
players that travel with them everywhere.
To find out more info on the audio book industry, contact The Audio
Publishers Association (APA) by calling (703) 556-7172 or visiting the 
organizations Web site at www.audiopub.org.
DVDs and videos
Instructional and how-to books often lend themselves perfectly to DVDs and
videos. Other types of nonfiction also can be easily adapted to this format,
perhaps using more of a documentary style of filming. Of course, if you have
a work of fiction, adapting your book into a direct-to-video movie is always an
option, but you want to team up with a movie production company.
Multimedia applications
You may want to consider producing an informational or instructional multi-
media application (a software package that can be used on a computer via
CD-ROM or experienced over the Internet). For example, this application can
be an educational program or computer game.
Finding partners and suppliers
Depending on the products you plan to create, you need to line up either
publishing and distribution partners or suppliers. In each of the following
sections, I show you how to line up people to help with audio, video, and
multimedia products.
Audio books
If you plan to produce an audio book, you need to find a recording studio,
producer, and someone to “host” or record the audio book. After the master
copy is edited and fully produced, it needs to be professionally duplicated,
packaged, sold, and distributed. You can either handle all these tasks your-
self or partner with an established audio book publisher and distributor.
Begin by finding a recording studio capable of producing this type of content.
You can find listings in the Yellow Pages or in industry publications focused
on the audio recording industry. The studio should be able to help you find
the right producer.
If you plan to hire a celebrity host, you need to approach that celebrity’s
manager or agent. Contact the Screen Actors Guild (www.sag.org) or the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (www.aftra.com) for
celebrity contact information.
331
Chapter 22: Expanding Your Income with Spin-Off Products and Services

Consider creating your audio book as a digital file. The file can then be sold
in different ways:
 Your Web site: The file can be sold and downloaded via the Internet
through your own Web site (see Chapter 21 for details on building a 
Web site).
 Apple iTunes: This online store sells downloadable audio and video 
content, mainly for use with Apple iPods and other types of compatible
MP3 players. To discover distribution opportunities for audio content
such as audio books through iTunes, point your Web browser to www.
apple.com/itunes/musicmarketing.
 Audible.com: This online store sells a wide range of downloadable audio
content for use with MP3 players or a computer. To find out more about
becoming an audio content provider for Audible.com, check out www.
audible.com.
DVDs and videos
Producing a video or DVD requires a significantly larger time and financial
commitment than audio books. Check out the following ways to save time
and money and to get your product distributed:
 Hire a camera crew: Produce a DVD or video on a smaller scale by
hiring a camera crew and producing on a relatively lower budget. A low-
budget video might cost $25,000 to $50,000, but costs can vary dramati-
cally. The result may not be a network-worthy TV program, but you can
have a professional piece worth selling in conjunction with your live
seminars or appearances (see “Generating Revenue with a Wide Range
of Services,” later in this chapter).
 Partner with an established producer: Instead of starting your own
video production company, partner with an established producer of
instructional DVDs or videos. Find existing products along the lines of
what you’re interested in producing, and then contact the companies
responsible for producing, marketing, and distributing those DVD and
video titles.
 Movie distribution: After your DVD is produced, make it available to the
public. There are a few ways to do this:
• Retail stores: You need to work with one or more distributors or
wholesalers that specialize in DVD distribution. Your alternative is
to contact the video buyers at retailers that sell DVDs and videos.
• Live appearances: When you make appearances, you can sell your
DVD in conjunction with your book, right on the spot.
• Rental services: You can make your DVDs available through rental
services, like NetFlix. To find out how to do this, visit the NetFlix
Web site at www.netflix.com/SubmitFilm.
332
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

Multimedia applications
To create multimedia programs successfully, you need to hire a software
development company and potentially a software publisher as well to obtain
proper distribution for your multimedia product. One of the best ways to do
this is to find a few software products that already exist and that are some-
what similar in style to what you want to produce, and then contact the com-
panies that produced them. You also check out the Yellow Pages in the
industry-oriented directories to find multimedia production companies.
Depending on your content, there’s typically a much smaller market for multi-
media applications than there is for DVDs or audio books. It’s important to
determine if this type of application is something that your book’s audience
would be interested in.
Generating Revenue with a 
Wide Range of Services
One of the best ways that an author can generate additional revenue is to
make himself available as a public speaker and offer seminars and/or work-
shops. Authors can also enter the ranks of the media and become consul-
tants or freelance experts to companies. I cover all these options in the
following sections.
Teaching and speaking in public
As a published author and expert in your field, you should take advantage of
the wide range of public speaking opportunities available to you. Many of these
opportunities pay speakers and instructors either a fee or honorarium — a pay-
ment given to a professional person for services for which fees aren’t legally or
traditionally required. Other occasions provide promotional opportunities and
the ability to sell books directly to program participants. Public speaking also
offers the opportunity to establish yourself further as an industry leader or
expert in your field. The following sections focus on ways to use your public
speaking skills to generate revenue and sell your book.
Here are some tips to help you get set for teaching and speaking 
engagements:
 Figure out what you have to say and who’d be interested in hearing
you speak. For example, a fiction author can offer readings from his
book or discuss its topic, and a nonfiction author can offer how-to
instruction relating to his area of expertise.
333
Chapter 22: Expanding Your Income with Spin-Off Products and Services

 Schedule free speaking engagements: Author appearances and lectures
at local bookstores or volunteering to speak in front of various nonprofit
organizations at public libraries or in schools within your community
are good ways to give you practice speaking in front of crowds.
 Join a public speaking organization: Joining groups such as
Toastmasters (www.toastmasters.org) or the National Speakers
Association (www.nsaspeaker.org) can help you establish your-
self as a professional public speaker.
Teach through adult education programs
Throughout the country, community colleges and other organizations spon-
sor hundreds of organized adult education and continuing education pro-
grams. These programs hire experts, authors, and industry leaders to teach a
wide range of classes, workshops, and seminars.
Students register and pay for your class, which can be a one-time seminar or
a class that spans three to eight weeks (based on your topic). In addition to
being paid to teach the class, you can sell your book to students who use
that book in the class, and you benefit from the exposure you receive by
being promoted as an instructor in the course catalog, promotional mailings,
and advertising done by the adult education program.
Some authors even create one course or workshop curriculum based on their
book, and then they work as an instructor for multiple adult education pro-
grams in various regions, ensuring an ongoing income stream.
To become an instructor for an adult education or continuing education pro-
gram, contact the school or adult education program organizer directly and
inquire about the process for proposing a new course or workshop. A written
proposal and an in-person meeting are typically required to pitch new course
ideas. Become familiar with the types of programs already being offered and
pitch an idea based around your book that you believe potential students
would be interested in and could benefit from.
The Learning Annex is a well-established adult education program around the
country. Each year, it hires and pays hundreds of experts and authors to
teach more than 8,000 classes and seminars on a wide range of topics.
Contact the organization at (212) 371-0280 or www.learningannex.com.
The Learning Annex has also developed a comprehensive DVD seminar if you
want to understand how to become a professional speaker. The $195 course
is available from the organization’s Web site. See — even it’s making money
with a course on how to teach a course.
Host your own seminars
Hosting a seminar is another great way to draw people into your audience
base and increase your revenue. If you want to host your own seminars, con-
sider the following steps before getting started:
334
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

1. Develop a half-day or full-day seminar curriculum. 
If you have experience public speaking, putting together a seminar
based on content from your book probably won’t be too difficult.
2. Rent a conference room at a hotel or small theater. 
The venue should provide the audio/video equipment you need and
ample space for participants to sit comfortably for the duration of the
seminar.
3. Invite participants to attend the seminar. 
Charge $25 to $500 a person (depending on the topic, the length of the
seminar, and your target audience). As you start figuring out how to
price and coordinate your events, consider hiring someone with event
or seminar planning experience to help you plan and market your semi-
nars properly.
4. Put together a direct mail piece or heavily promote your event
through the media. 
In your marketing plan, to help you gauge how many people may 
attend a seminar, offer an early-registration discount to encourage
people to reserve their spot in advance. (See Chapter 20 for details
about advertising.)
Getting enough people to attend your seminars to make them financially
worthwhile may seem a bit challenging, but start off small, with relatively low
expectations. For your first few seminars, plan on attracting a dozen or so
paying attendees. If your small seminars are well planned and worthwhile,
those attendees may spread the word and your following may expand, which
means your paying audience expands as well.
Lecture at colleges and universities
Many colleges and universities (as well as organizations and clubs affiliated
with schools) have budgets to bring in guest speakers and lecturers. If you’re
an expert on a topic that college or graduate-level students are interested in,
consider contacting local schools and making yourself available as a guest
lecturer. If you’re a fiction author, perhaps you can speak about the creative
writing process to English or literature majors.
If you’re prepared to make a larger time commitment, you could become a
visiting faculty member at a college or university and teach one or two
classes. To do this, however, you have to commit to being available at least
for one full semester and holding classes one or more times per week. (See
“Teach through adult education programs,” earlier in this chapter, for more
about teaching classes.)
335
Chapter 22: Expanding Your Income with Spin-Off Products and Services

Speak at trade shows and conferences
Industry trade shows and conferences always utilize guest speakers and lec-
turers. Depending on the trade show, these gigs are often paid. Even if the
trade show doesn’t pay its speakers, these gatherings provide an excellent
opportunity to further position yourself as an expert in your field and sell
books to your target audience. They’re also a great way to promote yourself
as a consultant or freelancer within your industry (see “Becoming a consul-
tant or freelancer,” later in this chapter).
You can find trade shows or seminars to speak at by reading industry trade
publications that focus on your area of expertise. If you can’t get invited to be
a speaker at a trade show, you can still promote yourself by setting up a
booth and selling your book or by distributing promotional materials about
your book (and your consulting services) to attendees.
Work with a speaker’s bureau
A speaker’s bureau is an organization that matches speakers with venues and
organizations looking for people to host lectures, seminars, or workshops.
The group promotes you as a public speaker, schedules speaking gigs on
your behalf, and then takes a commission based on the revenue you generate
from the appearances.
To sign up as a client with a speaker’s bureau, most agencies request that 
you first submit a video or audiotape of yourself speaking, along with a 
copy of your book and related promotional materials. You can find reputable
speaker’s bureaus to work with online or in the Yellow Pages under Speaker’s
Bureaus or Public Speaking.
Entering the ranks of the media
As an expert in your field, one way to share your knowledge and attract atten-
tion is to become a contributor to newspapers or radio. The following sec-
tions focus on these options.
Write a newspaper column
Writing a daily or weekly newspaper column focusing on your area of exper-
tise is a great way to promote yourself and your book, and generate an ongo-
ing income. First, contact a few local newspapers in your area (both daily and
weekly newspapers) and see if they’re looking to hire columnists. Chances
are, you may not earn much initially, but after the column is established, you
can syndicate it to dozens or hundreds of newspapers. Through syndication
you can earn a serious income. And remember to promote your book regu-
larly within your column.
336
Part V: Creating a Buzz: Publicity and Marketing 

As an established author, one way to syndicate your column is to work with
an established newspaper syndication company. To find out more about the
newspaper industry and the syndication process, subscribe to Editor &
Publisher magazine or visit the publication’s Web site at www.editorand
publisher.com. The Editor & Publisher 2005 Directory of Syndicates is an
excellent resource for contacting newspaper syndication companies.
Host a radio program
Talk radio is extremely popular on AM, FM, and satellite radio. Local radio
stations, programming syndication companies, and radio networks are
always looking for innovative new programming. To become a radio personal-
ity, you must
 Establish yourself as an expert in your field
 Have a great voice
 Exhibit an outgoing personality
After developing a concept for a talk radio program, contact the program
director at a few radio stations to discuss your idea. After that, you may
develop a strong following in a local market, and you can always syndicate
your show nationally or team up with a national radio network.
As a radio show host, you can regularly promote your book on the air, and
you can potentially earn a salary as a radio host. Some stations let you sell
your own advertising and keep some or all the revenue generated by the
show.
Most talk radio shows appeal to a broad audience and have mass appeal.
Therefore, if your book and area of expertise is extremely narrow, interest in
your program ideas may be limited.
Becoming a consultant or freelancer
If a company can benefit from your expertise, consider offering yourself as a
consultant or freelancer and charging by the hour or the day for your ser-
vices. Consultants with specific areas of expertise can earn $100 to $500 per
hour to share their knowledge and help companies solve problems, increase
sales, train employees, or overcome challenges.
In addition to being an expert on a topic, consultants also must
 Work well with others
 Be good educators and trainers
 Be self-motivated
337
Chapter 22: Expanding Your Income with Spin-Off Products and Services

 Value organization
 Generate highly creative ideas
 Possess extreme professionalism
 Be responsible enough to be their own bosses
 Promote the consulting business
 Handle day-to-day operations
 Manage the company’s finances
 Cater to the clients’ needs
Effectively mastering the above skills may ensure success right from the start.
Check out Freelancing For Dummies (Wiley) by Susan M. Drake for full details
on starting down the path to successful consulting and freelancing.
Don’t just quit your day job to become a consultant. Building up a successful
consulting business can take months or even years. Sure, being a published
author and recognized expert in your field helps enhance your reputation,
but establishing a large enough client base to support yourself financially
takes time and hard work. Consider starting off working as a part-time consul-
tant and building up your clientele before giving up your steady paycheck
and job-related benefits.

when it comes to writing, designing, printing, distributing,

Chapter 23
Ten Self-Publishing 
Mistakes to Avoid
In This Chapter
 Steering clear of research, writing, and editing problems
 Making sure you use your money and resources wisely
 Focusing on cover creation and book printing
 Watching out for distribution issues
 Putting effort into publicity and marketing
 Planning your time carefully
I
f you’re about to self-publish your first book, you can make a handful of mis-
takes that can mean the difference between a successful publishing venture
and a total bomb. Careful planning and implementing your own common sense
are two ingredients that can help guarantee your success. This chapter focuses
on ten common mistakes inexperienced self-publishers often make and offers
advice on how to avoid making these often costly mistakes.
Not Targeting Your Audience
Appropriately
In addition to ensuring that the content within your book is appropriate for
your intended readers, craft the language and vocabulary to appeal to your
readers and to be easily understandable. A fun, upbeat book about how to
create a scrapbook or plan a family vacation shouldn’t read like a history
textbook or scientific research paper. Know your audience and write specifi-
cally for those people. See Chapter 4 for more about target audiences.

Inaccurate Information, a Lack of
Organization, and Poor Writing
Providing inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or misleading information to
your reader damages your credibility and takes away value from your book.
Avoid this mistake by doing proper research. Even if you’re writing fiction,
you want your plots and characters to be realistic or believable. Chapter 4
has more information on research.
Proper organization makes your book easier to read. The content flows in a
more logical order and it’s easier to understand by the reader. The trick to
developing a well-organized book is to begin by developing an extremely
detailed outline before you start writing (see Chapter 4 for more details).
Just because you’ve decided to write a book doesn’t automatically mean that
you’re a talented writer. Many authors spend years fine-tuning their craft. 
If you feel that you don’t have the skills to create a well-written, full-length
manuscript, seriously consider hiring a co-author who’s a professional writer,
a ghostwriter, and/or a really good editor (see Chapter 5) to work with you.
A Lack of Attention to Detail and Editing
A well-written book contains absolutely no spelling mistakes, grammatical
errors, inaccurate information, misprints, incorrect details (such as incorrect
names, phone numbers, Web sites, statistics, chapter references, facts, or fig-
ures), or mislabeled figures and captions. In addition to proofreading your
own work, hiring a professional editor to review your manuscript before it
goes to press is crucial. See Chapter 5 for more about working with an editor.
Inefficiently Using Money and Resources
As a self-published author, all the expenses related to creating, editing, laying
out, printing, distributing, advertising, marketing, and promoting your book
come out of your pocket. Careful budgeting and knowing what expenses you
may incur during each stage of the self-publishing process helps you best uti-
lize the money that you have available when it comes to publishing your
book. See Chapter 6 for details on creating a business plan and a budget.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Implementing Poor Cover 
Design and Copy
Having a well-written book with a poorly written and designed cover or a bad
title has a negative impact on sales. Conversely, having an amazing cover and
catchy title on an otherwise average book may dramatically improve sales.
And hiring a professional graphic artist or experienced book cover designer
to create your book’s cover is an essential piece of your puzzle. Unless you
have professional graphic design experience, hire someone who does!
Chapter 9 goes into detail about book covers, including design and the
absolute importance of having a catchy title and subtitle.
Choosing the Wrong Printing Method
For many self-published authors, Print-On-Demand (POD) publishing offers
the perfect solution. It’s inexpensive, relatively quick and allows virtually
anyone with a good book idea to get published. POD (described in Chapter
11) has many benefits, but it’s not the ideal publishing solution for everyone.
Other traditional printing options, such as offset printing and eBook publish-
ing opportunities, may be more appropriate based on your goals. Chapters
10, 11, and 12 focus on your printing options.
A Lack of Comprehensive Distribution
In addition to writing an awesome book and heavily promoting it, the third
key ingredient for success is making sure that your target audience can find
and buy it. Based on how you’re going to publish your book, figure out the
best and most achievable distribution methods, and then make full use of
them. Part IV focuses on various distribution methods and opportunities
available to self-published authors.
Wasting the Potential 
of Online Distribution
Online sales, whether it’s through your own Web site or the well-established
online booksellers, such as Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com, are
343
Chapter 23: Ten Self-Publishing Mistakes to Avoid

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
344
extremely cost effective and powerful distribution channels that can’t be
ignored by self-publishers. These days, more and more people are Internet
savvy and finding ordering books online convenient.
As you discover in Chapter 14, however, simply getting your book listed on
an online bookseller doesn’t generate sales. Ways do exist, however, to pro-
mote your book heavily on online.
Improperly Planning the Publicity 
and Marketing Campaign
Writing what can potentially be a bestseller and publishing it is certainly
important, but making sure that potential readers know about your book’s
existence is equally important when it comes to generating sales. Many self-
published authors do an excellent job creating and publishing their book, 
but inadvertently they forget about marketing and advertising, or they don’t
realize the importance of these efforts.
A comprehensive and well-timed advertising, marketing, and public relations
campaign is crucial for a book’s success. If you don’t have the advertising,
marketing, and PR savvy to create, launch and manage an effective, well-
planned, and comprehensive campaign, hire experienced experts to help.
Check out Part V for more on publicity and marketing.
Bad Timing throughout the 
Self-Publishing Process
As you complete the various steps in the publishing process, pay careful
attention to scheduling, lead times, and deadlines. Rushing steps, cutting 
corners, or taking shortcuts is a surefire way to failure and making costly 
mistakes. See Chapter 1 for a brief timeline of steps in the self-publishing
process.
Timing also refers to when your book actually gets published and becomes
available to readers online or at retail. Is there a specific date, season, holi-
day, or time of year when interest in your book may be stronger? Choosing
the most appropriate release date is essential, especially if the book some-
how ties into or relates to a specific date, holiday, or season. Most people
aren’t going to buy a Christmas cookbook in July. See Chapter 7 for tips on
selecting your book’s publication date.

Chapter 24
Ten Useful Resources 
for Self-Publishers
In This Chapter
 Finding helpful books and print publications
 Surfing the Web for help
 Contacting professional associations
A
s you embark on your self-publishing project, you don’t need to reinvent
the wheel and find new ways of accomplishing each step involved with
the process. Work from what many others before you have done and rely on
the companies that have established expertise in the book publishing field.
This chapter describes a handful of awesome resources self-publishers can
use to get questions answered, find referrals, and discover more about vari-
ous aspects of book publishing.
Books for Writers Worth Reading
The following are books written specifically for authors, writers, and journal-
ists. These books come in handy when they’re added to your personal refer-
ence library and referred to during the writing process.
The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th Edition
Published by the University of Chicago Press, The Chicago Manual of Style,
15th Edition offers more than 1,000 pages of information designed to help
writers properly use the English language. This book is a reference book 
that every writer should have on his desk. The manual is also available on
CD-ROM and portions of it can be accessed for free online. Check out the
resource online at www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/cmosfaq.

Other great reference books
To round out your reference library as a writer, grab a copy of Merriam-Webster’s
Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition (Merriam-Webster) and The Elements of 
Style, 4th Edition (Longman) by William Strunk, Jr. These resources are excellent
books for quickly answering common questions (like “How on earth do I spell
this word?”).
Helpful Print Publications
The following print publications are targeted to people in book publishing.
These magazines and newsletters offer information articles about trends in
the publishing industry and how-to articles of interest to writers. They also
provide valuable advice on how to write or publish all types of material.
Booklist
The American Library Association publishes a well-respected resource that
librarians and booksellers often refer to when choosing new titles to pur-
chase and inventory. This resource is called Booklist, and it comprises pri-
marily new book reviews along with advertising from publishers. For people
working in the publishing field, a positive review from Booklist gives you and
your book a lot of credibility. The subscription rate is $295 per year. Visit
www.ala.org/booklist for more information.
Book Marketing Update
Book Marketing Update is a biweekly newsletter targeting self-published
authors and small publishing houses. The newsletter focuses primarily on
inexpensive ways to market a book to the general public and the media. In
addition to informative articles, each issue includes contact information for
at least a dozen media outlets interested in receiving books to review.
