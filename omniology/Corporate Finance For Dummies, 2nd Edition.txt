Introduction      1
Introduction
I
 
n case you couldn’t already tell, this book is about corporate finance. If you were 
looking for poodle grooming, you picked up the wrong book. Go try again.
Corporate finance is the study of how groups of people work together as a single 
organization to provide something of value to society. If a corporation is using up 
more value than it’s producing, it will lose money and fail. In corporate finance, 
you measure value using money, and the final goal of a corporation is to make 
money.
Ensuring that a corporation is financially successful is far more complicated than 
simply ensuring that a corporation is profitable, though. Throughout this book, I 
discuss a wide range of topics in corporate finance. This is an introductory book, 
after all, so think of it as a sampler or a greatest-hits album — it’s everything you 
need in order to understand what corporate finance is and how to begin function-
ing on a basic level in the world of finance.
About This Book
This book is a little different from other corporate finance books. First of all, it’s 
better. More useful than that, though, is that this book is written and organized so 
that people with absolutely no understanding of corporate finance can use it as a 
reference guide. It’s also a wonderfully interesting read.
Everything in this book is written as if you’re a complete newbie. The little details 
are pointed out, and when stuff gets too complicated, I just summarize the topic. 
I also explain — or at least clarify — everything, in normal everyday language, 
without trying to sound very technical. This book is all about making the subject 
of corporate finance accessible to everyone, while also trying to keep it from being 
too dry. Corporate finance books can be really boring, which is sad because they 
don’t need to be.

To enhance your reading experience, I use the following conventions:
»
» New terms are in italics, with an easy-to-understand definition  
provided nearby.
»
» Bold is used to highlight key words and phrases in bulleted and numbered 
lists.
»
» In math equations, variables are italicized to set them apart from letters.
To make the content more accessible, I divided it into six parts:
»
» Part 1, What’s Unique about Corporate Finance: This part talks a lot about 
what money is, what corporate finance is and the role it plays, and the people 
and organizations that utilize corporate financial information.
»
» Part 2, Making a Statement: Reading financial statements is a lot easier than 
learning a language, but odds are this process is going to be just as new to 
you, so I take several chapters to break it down easily.
»
» Part 3, Valuations on the Price Tags of Business: Before you buy or invest in 
something, how do you figure out what it’s worth? You start by reading the 
chapters in this part!
»
» Part 4, A Wonderland of Risk Management: The chapters in this part deal 
heavily in risk and cover some of the more cutting-edge topics in corporate 
finance.
»
» Part 5, Financial Management: Find out about evaluating corporate financial 
performance, forecasting future financial performance, and assessing the 
performance of other corporations for potential mergers and acquisition 
(M&A).
»
» Part 6, The Part of Tens: Each chapter in this part includes ten things you 
really should know, whether you intend to pursue corporate finance or not.
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I’ve done my best to assume that you, the reader, know 
absolutely nothing. That being said, no one is perfect. I strive to point out the 
details, and when stuff gets too complicated, I just summarize the topic. I also

trying to sound very technical. This book is all about making the subject of corpo-
rate finance accessible to everyone, while also trying to keep it from being too dry. 
Corporate finance books can be boring, which is sad because they don’t need to be. 
This book is a bit heavy on the math. Yes, I know, math is hard. I never liked it, 
either. That’s why the majority of the math is supplemented with explanations of 
how to do the calculations that’s simple enough to spare you from needing to 
know how to actually read math.
You can also supplement the information in this book by checking out Accounting 
For Dummies by John A. Tracy (Wiley). It can help give you more detail about these 
topics. I really tried to only include those details relevant to the subject of corpo-
rate finance.
Other than that, if you’re reading this right now, then you’re prepared to begin 
reading Corporate Finance For Dummies!
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see a few icons scattered around the book. These icons highlight bits of 
information that are of particular importance to you. Here’s what to look for:
Professionals get good at what they do by making stupid mistakes and learning 
from them. Now you can learn from these stupid mistakes without the unfortu-
nate side effects usually associated with making them yourself. Just look for the 
Tip icon.
Whenever you see this icon, it means that you may one day need to remember the 
information included. You may want to consider keeping it in mind.
When you see this icon, it means that I’m talking about something that may pose 
a serious threat. I’m not being facetious this time, either. Corporate finance is a 
study in money, and this is an intro book, so in some instances, you really should 
just go talk to a professional before you get yourself or others into financial or 
legal trouble.

New to this Edition
First, and arguably more importantly, the writing in this edition has been cleaned 
up quite a lot and just generally improved over the previous edition. As for con-
tent, there are new sections added to this book, such as addressing cryptocurrency 
and quantitative finance. Information and examples have been updated, while 
some outdated content was removed.
Beyond the Book
In addition to the abundance of information and guidance related to corporate 
finance that I provide in this book, you get access to even more help and informa-

Where to Go from Here
This book isn’t linear. I didn’t write the chapters in order, and you don’t have to 
read them in order. However, you may want to begin with the chapters that are 
included in Parts 2 and 3 before attempting the chapters in Parts 4 and 5. At least 
flip through the earlier pages to make sure that you’re familiar with how to read 
financial statements and the time value of money before you attempt to move on 
to Parts 4 and 5. As long as you’re familiar with both those things, nothing in this 
book will be out of your reach.

orporate finance is more than just a measure of money. As you see in this 
chapter, money is incidental to finance. When discussing corporate finance, 
we are actually looking at the entire world in a new way — a way that mea-
sures the entire universe and the things within it in a way that makes it useful to 
us. We can calculate things in terms of corporate finance that simply can’t be 
accurately measured in any other way. Throughout this chapter we talk about the 
nature of money and how it applies to corporate finance.
Telling a Story with Numbers
Corporate finance is the study of relationships between groups of people that quan-
tifies the otherwise immeasurable. To understand how this definition makes any 
sense at all, first you have to take a quick look at the role of money in the world.
According to Adam Smith, an 18th century economist, the use of money was pre-
ceded by a barter system. In a barter system, people exchange goods and services 
of relatively equivalent value without using money. Perhaps if you worked

growing hemp and making rope out of it, you could give that rope to people in 
exchange for food, clothes, or whatever else you needed that the people around 
you might be offering. What happens, though, when someone wants rope, but that 
person has nothing you want? What about those times when you need food, but no 
one needs rope? Because of these times, people started to use a rudimentary form 
of money. So, say that you sell your rope to someone, but they have nothing you 
want. Instead, they give you a credit for their services that you are free to give to 
anyone else. You decide to go and buy a bunch of beer, giving the brewer the note 
of credit, ensuring that the person who bought your rope will provide the brewer 
a service in exchange for giving you beer. Thus, the invention of money was born, 
though in a very primitive form.
Looking at money in this way, you come to realize that money is actually debt. 
When you hold money, it means that you’ve provided goods or services of value to 
someone else and that you are now owed value in return. The development of a 
standardized, commonly used currency among large numbers of people simply 
increases the number of people willing to accept your paper or coin I.O.U.s, mak-
ing that currency easier to exchange among a wider number of people, across 
greater distances, and for a more diverse variety of potential goods and services.
According to 21st century anthropologist David Graebner, this story was probably 
something closer to bartering with the government as a taxation, which meant 
providing goods and services to the government (for example, the emperor) and 
then being provided units of “currency” worth production rations. So, you can say 
that money was invented for the first government contractors as a method for the 
government to acquire resources in return for units of early currency worth spe-
cific amounts of resources rather than a true barter.
Simply put, money is debt for the promise of goods and services that have an 
inherent usefulness, but money itself is not useful except as a measure of debt. 
People use money to measure the value that they place on things. How much value 
did a goat have in ancient Egypt? You could say that one goat was worth five 
chickens, but that wouldn’t be very helpful. You could say that a brick maker’s 
labor was worth half that of a beer maker, but you couldn’t exactly measure that 
mathematically, either. Using these methods, people had no real way to establish 
a singular, definitive measurement for the value that they placed on different 
things. How can you measure value, then? You measure value by determining the 
amount of money that people are willing to exchange for different things. This 
method allows you to very accurately determine how people interact, the things 
they value, and the relative differences in value between certain things or certain 
people’s efforts. Much about the nature of people, the things they value, and even 
how they interact together begin to become very clear when you develop an under-
standing of what they’re spending money on and how much they’re spending.

CHAPTER 1  The Tale of Corporate Finance      9
Fast-forward more than eight millennia — well after the establishment of using 
weighted coins to measure an equivalent weight of grain, well after the standard-
ized minting of currency, and well past the point where the origins of money 
became forgotten by the vast majority of the world’s population (welcome to the 
minority) — all the way into the modern era of finance. Money begins to take on 
a more abstract role. People use it as a way to measure resource allocations 
between groups and within groups. They even begin to measure how well a group 
of people are interacting by looking at their ability to produce more using less. 
Success is measured by their ability to hoard greater amounts of this interpersonal 
debt. The ability to hoard debt in this manner defines whether the efforts of one 
group of people are more or less successful than the efforts of another group. 
People use money to place a value on everything, and, because of this, it’s possible 
to compare “apples and oranges.” Which one is better, apples or oranges? The one 
that people place more value on based on the total amount of revenues. Higher 
revenues tell you that people place greater value on one of those two fruits because 
they are willing to pay for the higher costs plus any additional profits.
So, when I say that corporate finance is the study of the relationships between 
groups of people, I’m referring to measuring how groups of people are allocating 
resources among themselves, putting value on goods and services, and interacting 
with each other in the exchange of these goods and services. Corporate finance 
picks apart the financial exchanges of groups of people, all interconnected in pro-
fessional relationships, by determining how effectively and efficiently they work 
together to build value and manage that value once it’s been acquired. Those 
organizations that are more effective at developing a cohesive team of people who 
work together to build value in the marketplace will be more successful than their 
competitors.
In corporate finance, you measure all this mathematically in order to assess the 
success of the corporate organization, evaluate the outcome of potential decisions, 
and optimize the efforts of those people who form economic relationships, even if 
for just a moment, as they exchange goods, services, and value in a never-ending 
series of financial transactions. The financial decisions made collectively form a 
trend of behaviors that can be analyzed using any of several types of indicators:
»
» Leading indicators: Leading indicators include any measures of macroeco-
nomic data that indicate what the health of the economy will look like in the 
immediate future, including new unemployment claims, for example.
»
» Coincident indicators: Coincident indicators are measures of macroeco-
nomic data that indicate the health of the economy now. One example is new 
industrial production.
»
» Lagging indicators: Lagging indicators are indicators that tend to confirm 
what the economy has already begun to do, such as duration of 
unemployment.

10      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
»
» Sentiment indices: These are measures of how people feel about the 
economy. They aren’t entirely accurate nor always helpful, but they do help 
give us an idea about how people feel about the economy, which does tend to 
be tied to other hard data. Consumer sentiment, for example, tends to be 
down when employment is down or when people don’t feel confident in their 
own employment. These factors tend to influence stocks nearly as signifi-
cantly as other, more solid, indicators.
Characterizing Motivations
Corporate finance plays a very interesting role in all societies. Finance is the study 
of relationships between people: how they distribute themselves and their 
resources, place value on things, and exchange that value among each other. 
Because that’s the case, finance (all finance) is the science of decision-making. 
This is the process of studying human behavior and determining how people make 
decisions regarding what they do with their lives and the things they own. Corpo-
rate finance, as a result, studies decision-making in terms of what is done by 
groups of people working together in a professional manner.
This definition guides you in two primary directions regarding what makes cor-
porate finance unique:
»
» It tells you that corporate finance is a critical aspect of human life as an 
intermediary that allows people to transfer value among themselves.
»
» It tells you how groups of people interact as a single unit, a corporation, and 
how decisions are made on behalf of the corporation by people called 
managers.
Corporate finance is far more than a study about money. Money is just the unit of 
measure people use to calculate everything and make sense of it numerically, to 
compare things in absolute terms rather than relative ones. Corporate finance is a 
unique study that measures value. Once you accept that, it becomes apparent that 
everything in the world has value. Therefore, you can use corporate finance to 
measure everything around you that relates to a corporation, directly or indirectly 
(which, in the vast majority of the world, is everything).

CHAPTER 1  The Tale of Corporate Finance      11
The role of financial institutions
Probably the easiest way to understand how corporate finance acts as a critical 
intermediary process between groups of people is to look at the role of financial 
institutions in the greater economy. Financial institutions, such as banks and 
credit unions, have a role that involves redistributing money between those who 
want money and those who have excess money, all in a manner that the general 
population believes is based on reasonable terms.
Now, whether financial institutions as a whole are fully successful in their role is 
no longer a matter of debate: They are not. The cyclical role being played out time 
and again prior to the Great Depression, prior to the 1970s economic troubles, and 
prior to the 2007 collapse are symptomatic of a systematic operational failure yet 
to be resolved. For the most part, the role they play is necessary, however. These 
institutions facilitate the movement of resources across the entire world. They 
accept money from those who have more than they’re using and offer interest rate 
payments in return. Then they turn around and give that money to those seeking 
loans, charging interest for this service. In this role, financial institutions are 
intermediaries that allow people on either side of these sorts of transactions to 
find each other by way of the bank itself. Without this role, investments and loans 
would very nearly come to a total halt compared to the extremely high volume and 
value of the current financial system.
Corporate finance plays a similar role as an intermediary for the exchange of value 
of goods and services between individuals and organizations. Corporate finance, 
as the representation of the value developed by groups of people working together 
toward a single cause, studies how money is used as an intermediary of exchange 
between and within these groups to reallocate value as is deemed necessary.
Defining investing
It may be helpful to backtrack a bit. What the heck is an investment, anyway? An 
investment is anything that you buy for the purpose of deriving greater value than 
you spent to acquire it. Yes, yes, stocks and bonds are good examples; you buy 
them, they go up in value, and you sell them. But you can think of some other 
examples that aren’t so . . . already in this book. A house that you buy for the pur-
pose of generating income is a good example of an investment: You buy it, you 
generate revenue as its renters pay their rent, and after the house goes up in 
value, you sell it. (Your own home usually isn’t considered an investment.)
Because money places an absolute value on transactions that take place, you can 
very easily measure not only these transactions but also all of several potential 
options in a given decision. In other words, you can measure the outcome of a 
decision before it’s made, thanks to corporate finance. That’s the second thing 

12      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
that makes corporate finance a very unique study: It analyzes the value of interac-
tions between people, the value of the actions taken, and the value of the decisions 
made and then compiles that information into a single agglomerate based on pro-
fessional interconnectedness in a single corporation.
This analysis allows you to measure how effectively you’re making decisions and 
optimize the outcome of future decisions you’ll have to make. The decisions that 
corporations make tend to have very far-reaching consequences, influencing the 
lives of employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and the greater national econ-
omy, so ensuring that a corporation is making the correct decisions is of the 
utmost importance. Corporate finance allows you to do this, so if you have a 
favorite corporation, hug the financial analysts next time you see them (or maybe 
just send a cookie bouquet; you might freak someone out if you just randomly 
starting hugging people).
Setting the Stage
Unless you’re in a rare minority who live “off the grid” (secluded and  
self-sufficient), nearly every aspect of your life is strongly influenced, directly or 
otherwise, by corporate finances. The price and availability of the things you buy 
are decided using financial data. Chances are high that your job relies on decisions 
made using financial data. Your savings and investments all rely quite heavily on 
financial information. Your house, car, where you live, and even the laws in your 
area are all determined using financial information about corporations.
From the very beginning, a corporation needs to decide how it will fund its start-
up, the time when it first begins purchasing supplies to start operating. This single 
decision decides a significant amount about the corporation’s costs, which, in 
turn, decide a lot about the prices it will charge. Where it sells its goods depends 
greatly on whether the corporation can sell its goods at a price high enough to 
generate a profit after the costs of production and distribution, assuming that 
competitors can’t drive down prices in that area. The number of units that the 
corporation produces depends entirely on how productive its equipment is, and 
the corporation will only purchase more equipment if doing so doesn’t cost more 
than the corporation will be able to make in profits.
These factors affect your job, too; the corporation will hire more people who add 
value to the company only if it’s profitable to do so. Where your job is located will 
depend greatly on where in the world it’s cheapest to locate operations related to 
your line of work. The decision to outsource your job to some other nation depends 
entirely on whether that role within the company can be done more cheaply else-
where, without incurring risks that are too expensive. That’s right, even risk can 
be measured mathematically in financial terms.

CHAPTER 1  The Tale of Corporate Finance      13
You’re probably thinking to yourself, “But that’s only my work life. Surely corpo-
rate finance has no influence on my personal life.” Well, besides controlling how 
much you make, what you can afford, what your job is, and where you work, cor-
porations have this habit of also financially assessing government policy.
When a proposed law (called a bill) is introduced, corporations determine what its 
financial impact will be on them. They also assess whether a law that exists (or 
doesn’t exist) has a financial impact on corporations. If the impact is greater than 
the cost of hiring a lobbyist in Washington, D.C., they’ll hire a lobbyist to pressure 
politicians into doing what they want. This effort includes campaign contribu-
tions, marketing on behalf of the politician, and more. Going even as big as inter-
national relations between nations, a single large corporation can bring an entire 
global industry to a stop by convincing the right people that one nation is selling 
goods at a price lower than cost, which causes political conflict between nations. 
This scenario has happened multiple times in the past, with the majority of claims 
being made by U.S. companies, and it can easily happen again.
Every aspect of your life is influenced in some way by the information derived 
from corporate finance. Money is a measure of value, and you are valuable, so 
nearly everything that makes you who you are can be measured in terms of money. 
If it can be measured in terms of money, decisions will be made in terms of money. 
If you’re not the one making those decisions, you should probably be asking your-
self who is.

unlimited in offerings any particular organization may be, they’re all intercon-
nected, and each one plays a very important role in the greater economy. All the 
organizations in Finance Land influence each other and the individuals working 
for them in several important ways that vary depending on which type of organi-
zation you’re talking about.
The following sections introduce you to some of the more common financial insti-
tutions and related organizations and explain how each one plays a role in the 
world of corporate finance.
Corporations
In case the name of this book didn’t give it away already, corporations are the pri-
mary focus, so I start your finance tour with them. Corporations are a special type of 
organization wherein the people who have ownership can transfer their shares of 
ownership to other individuals without having to legally reorganize the company. 
This transferring of shares is possible because the corporation is considered a sepa-
rate legal entity from its owners, which isn’t the case for other forms of companies. 
This characteristic has a few significant implications that influence the financial 
operations and status of corporations compared to other forms of organizations:
»
» Professional managers typically run corporations rather than the 
owners given the wide distribution of ownership by non-owners. This 
leads to questions about moral hazard — the conflict of interest that occurs 
when managers make decisions that benefit themselves rather than the 
owners of the organization they’re managing, called the agency problem. 
Often, an individual who holds a very large proportion of a corporation’s stock 
will also be a manager or a director, but generally speaking, corporations have 
the resources to hire highly experienced professionals.
»
» The corporation is taxed on its earnings separately from the owners. In 
most organizations, the profits are considered the owners’ income and they’re 
only taxed as such. In corporations, however, the company itself is taxed on 
any earnings it makes and the owners are taxed on any income they generate 
by possessing stock ownership (called capital gains). This double taxation of 
income is one of the pitfalls associated with a corporate structure.
»
» Corporations have limited liability, meaning the owners can’t be sued for 
the actions of the company. Oddly enough, this characteristic also fre-
quently protects managers, though to a lesser extent since the establishment 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley laws, which hold managers more accountable.
»
» Corporations are required to disclose all their financial information in a 
regulated, systematic, and standardized manner. These records are public 
not only to the government and the shareholders but also to the public. 
Shareholders can also request specialized financial information.

CHAPTER 2  Introducing Finance Land      17
The primary goal of corporations is to provide goods or services in exchange for 
money; their underlying goal is to generate a profit, as the law requires them to 
operate using the Shareholder Wealth Maximization model wherein corporate man-
agement is legally obligated to operate in a manner that increases profitability and 
corporate value and, as a result, increase the value of the shares of stock held by 
the shareholders as the owners of the corporation. In most cases, profits are the 
income of a corporation. The one exception is the nonprofit corporation, which 
includes such organizations as The American Red Cross, many public universities, 
and other organizations that operate within the parameters of a tax-exempt sta-
tus. Although nonprofits can still be profitable, their profits are capped (meaning 
they can’t make more than a specific percentage in profit), so they use their 
resources to provide goods or services below cost. Many nonprofits choose not to 
generate any revenues, relying instead on donations. (Due to the unique consid-
erations that you must give nonprofit organizations when assessing them, I don’t 
discuss them further in this book.)
Depository institutions
Anytime you give your money to someone with the expectation that the person 
will hold it for you and give it back when you request it, you’re either dealing with 
a depository institution or acting very foolishly. Depository institutions come in 
several different types, but they all function in the same basic manner:
»
» They accept your money and typically pay interest over time, though some 
accounts will provide other services to attract depositors in lieu of inter-
est payments.
»
» While holding your money, they lend it out to other people or organizations in 
the form of mortgages or other loans and generate more interest than they 
pay you.
»
» When you want your money back, they have to give it back. Fortunately, they 
usually have enough deposits that they can give you back what you want. 
That’s not always true, as everyone saw during the Great Depression, but it’s 
almost always the case. Plus, safeguards are now in place to protect against 
another Great Depression in the future (at least one that occurs because 
banks lend out more money than they keep on hand to pay back to their 
lenders).
The three main types of depository institutions are commercial banks, savings 
institutions, and credit unions.

18      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
Commercial banks
Commercial banks are easily the largest type of depository institution. They’re for-
profit corporations that are usually owned by private investors. They often offer a 
wide range of services to consumers and corporations around the world. Often the 
size of the bank determines the exact scope of the services it offers. For example, 
smaller community or regional banks typically limit their services to consumer 
banking and small-business lending, which includes simple deposits, mortgage 
and consumer loans (such as car, home equity, and so on), small-business bank-
ing, small-business loans, and other services with a limited range of markets. 
Larger national or global banks often also perform services such as money man-
agement, foreign exchange services, investing, and investment banking, for large 
corporations and even other banks like overnight interbank loans. Large commer-
cial banks have the most diverse set of services of all the depository institutions.
Savings institutions
Have you ever passed by a savings bank or savings association? Those are both 
forms of savings institutions, which have a primary focus on consumer mortgage 
lending. Sometimes savings institutions are designed as corporations; other times 
they’re set up as mutual cooperatives, wherein depositing cash into an account buys 
you a share of ownership in the institution. Corporations don’t use these institu-
tions frequently, however, so I don’t cover them throughout the rest of the book.
Credit unions
Credit unions are mutual cooperatives, wherein making deposits into a particular 
credit union is similar to buying stock in that credit union. The earnings of  
that credit union are distributed to everyone who has an account in the form of 
dividends (in other words, depositors are partial owners). Credit unions are highly 
focused on consumer services, so I don’t discuss them extensively here or else-
where in this book. However, their design is important to understand because this 
same format is very popular among the commercial banks in Muslim nations, 
where sharia law forbids charging or paying traditional forms of interest. As a 
result, the structure of a credit union in the U. S. is adopted by commercial banks 
in other parts of the world, so a basic awareness of this structure can be useful for 
international corporate banking.
Insurance companies
Insurance companies are a special type of financial institution that deals in the 
business of managing risk. A corporation periodically gives them money and, in 
return, they promise to pay for the losses the corporation incurs if some 

CHAPTER 2  Introducing Finance Land      19
unfortunate event occurs, causing damage to the well-being of the organization. 
Here are a few terms you need to know when considering insurance companies:
»
» Deductible: The amount that the insured must pay before the insurer will 
pay anything
»
» Premium: The periodic payments the insured makes to ensure coverage
»
» Co-pay: An expense that the insured pays when sharing the cost with the 
insurer
»
» Indemnify: A promise to compensate one for losses experienced
»
» Claim: The act of reporting an insurable incident to request that the insurer 
pay for coverage
»
» Benefits: The money the insured receives from the insurance company when 
something goes wrong
You’re probably thinking to yourself right now, “Wait. You pay the insurance 
company to indemnify your assets, but then it makes you pay a premium, deduct-
ible, and co-pay and caps your benefits? What’s the point?” Yeah, I know. Insur-
ance companies can calculate the probability of something happening and then 
charge you a price based on the estimated cost of insuring you. They generate 
profits by charging more than your statistical cost of making claims.
Think of it like this: As a nation, people in the United States overpay for every-
thing that’s insured by an amount equal to the profits of the insurance companies. 
Originally, this setup allowed corporations and individuals to share the risk of 
loss; each person paid just a little bit so no person had to face the full cost of a 
serious disaster. Unfortunately, this is decreasingly the case, as insurance compa-
nies grow in profitability and incur unnecessary overhead costs. That’s precisely 
why many nations require their insurance companies to operate as nonprofit 
organizations.
You can insure just about anything on the planet. (Consider that Lloyd’s of London 
will insure the hands of a concert pianist or the tongue of a famous wine taster!) 
The following sections outline three of the most common (and relevant) types of 
insurance companies as far as corporations are concerned.
Health insurance companies
Corporations deal a lot with health insurance companies because their employees 
often demand health insurance — not to mention healthy employees tend to be 
more productive. Health insurance is a very popular benefit for employees because 

20      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
being insured as a part of a large group is generally less expensive than trying to 
find individual insurance:
»
» Group insurance is cheaper than individual insurance because the probability 
of large groups of people being rewarded more than they pay in premiums is 
lower than that of individuals.
»
» Group insurance was frequently the only option that allowed for coverage on 
preexisting conditions (conditions people developed before receiving insur-
ance); however, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to people.
Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are a popular, and often cheaper, insur-
ance option for both corporations and individuals because they require everyone 
insured to go through a general physician, who acts as a kind of gatekeeper by 
determining whether a referral to a specialist is required.
Life insurance companies
Life insurance companies work similarly to other types of insurance companies, 
except that the only time they pay benefits is when you die. Corporations some-
times take life insurance policies on critical employees who have specialized skills 
or knowledge that can’t be easily replaced without significant financial losses. 
Many corporations also offer group life insurance which, like health insurance, is 
cheaper than individual insurance. Life insurance comes in two basic flavors: 
whole and term. Each one has a wealth of variations and additional options. The 
types have many differences, but the primary distinction is that term life insur-
ance is paid for a set period and is only valid as long as it is being paid, while 
whole life insurance is considered permanent and will build value over time.
Property-casualty insurance companies
Property-casualty insurance is the most critical type of insurance for corporations 
to have. It covers the potential harm that can befall a company or anyone on prop-
erty owned by the company should an accident occur. Did a meteor fall from the 
sky and smash your headquarters? That’s insurable!
Securities firms
Securities firms provide transaction services related to financial investments, which 
are quite distinct from the services provided by traditional depository institutions. 
However, many commercial banks have separate departments that offer the ser-
vices of securities firms, and others merge or partner with securities firms. (For 
example, Bank of America is a commercial bank that bought the securities firm 

CHAPTER 2  Introducing Finance Land      21
known as Merrill Lynch.) Still other securities firms are completely independent 
of any depository institution. Exactly which types of services a securities firm 
provides depends on the type of institution it is.
Investment banks
Investment banks deal exclusively in corporations and other businesses as clients 
as well as products. In other words, they offer a wide range of services, including 
underwriting services for companies that issue stock on the primary market, 
­broker-dealer services for both buyers and sellers of stock on the primary and 
secondary markets, merger and acquisitions services, assistance with corporate 
reorganization and bankruptcy procedures, general consulting services for corpo-
rations large enough to afford them, and other such services related to raising or 
transferring capital.
Broker-dealers
In case you couldn’t tell from their name, broker-dealers perform the services of 
both brokers and dealers:
»
» Brokers are organizations that conduct securities transactions on the part of 
their clients — buying, selling, or trading for the investment portfolio of 
their clients.
»
» Dealers are organizations that buy or sell securities of their own portfolio and 
then deal those securities to customers who are looking to buy them.
»
» Broker-dealers are organizations that do a combination of both of these 
services. They perform pretty much all the middle-man functions of providing 
securities services to corporations and individuals alike, and they’ve all but 
eliminated the need for organizations that specialize in either broker or dealer 
services.
A special type of broker, called a discount broker, performs similar functions as 
broker-dealers, except that they only perform the transactions, while broker-
dealers often provide assistance by offering advice, analysis, and other 
services that can help their customers make investment decisions. Discount 
brokers don’t perform these additional services.
Underwriters
A special type of insurance company, called underwriters, deals only with other 
insurance companies. They analyze applications for insurance, determine the 
degree of risk and associated costs with issuing insurance, and determine 

22      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
eligibility and price. Some insurance companies have their own internal under-
writing departments, while others outsource to external companies that specialize 
in just underwriting.
Banking underwriters are slightly different in that they assess the risk and potential 
of loan applicants to pay back their loans. They assist banks in determining what 
interest rate to charge and whether applicants are even eligible for a loan.
Securities underwriters assess the value of a particular organization or other asset 
for which securities are being issued. In other words, if a company wanted to 
become a corporation, one step in that process is to determine the value of the 
company, the number of shares to issue, and the amount of money the company 
is liable to raise and to help with the distribution and sale of the original shares of 
stock to raise money for the company to become a corporation.
Funds
During the early days of the Christian church and then again in the United States 
in the 1960s, groups often pooled all their assets together and allowed them to be 
managed for the good of the group. Funds are basically the free-market-investor 
version of this collective idea. Individuals pool their money together in a fund, 
that money is managed as a single investment portfolio, and the individuals who 
contributed to that portfolio (the fund) receive returns on their investments pro-
portional to their ownership in the returns generated by the entire portfolio.
The point of pooling assets is to make professional investments and investing 
strategies available to people who otherwise wouldn’t have the resources on their 
own to pursue such investments. Funds are popular options for corporations to 
provide for the retirement funds of their employees, but corporations themselves 
also frequently trust their investment management to a fund. Generally speaking, 
each fund has its own investing strategy, so investors choosing between funds 
must pick one that has a strategy they believe will most benefit them.
Funds come in two types — hedge funds and mutual funds — and although they 
both have the same fundamental principles, each type has some unique traits, 
processes, regulations, and variations. Table  2-1 gives you a quick look at the 
main differences.

CHAPTER 2  Introducing Finance Land      23
Financing institutions
Financing institutions are kind of like banks in that they lend money, but they’re a 
bit different, too. First of all, they tend to give different types of loans than banks 
do. Secondly, they get their funding by borrowing it themselves instead of through 
deposits. They earn a profit by charging you higher interest rates than they’re 
paying on their own loans.
Sales financing institutions
If you’ve been to a car dealership, furniture store, jewelry store, or some other 
retailer that deals in expensive merchandise, odds are you’ve been offered a loan 
that you can use to purchase an item immediately and then pay off the loan in 
installments. The store itself isn’t offering you the loan; a type of financing insti-
tution called a sales financing institution works with the store to give you the loan. 
Sales financing institutions work with both individuals and companies making 
large purchases.
Personal credit institutions
Personal credit institutions are companies that offer small personal loans and credit 
cards to individuals. Because they don’t have much to do with corporate finance — 
unless the personal credit institution itself is a corporation or you’re using your 
personal line of credit to invest in a corporation (in which case, as long as your 
returns exceed the interest you’re paying, then good for you) — I don’t cover this 
topic in detail here or elsewhere in this book.
TABLE 2-1 
Differences between Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds
Hedge Funds
Mutual Funds
Strategy
Managers have more freedom in 
their use of investment tools and 
an ability to change strategy as 
they see fit.
Managers must adhere strictly to the strategy described 
when the fund was established and must choose from a 
rather limited range of investment types.
Fees
Hedge funds typically charge a 
fee based on the performance of 
the fund; the better the fund 
­performs in the market, the  
more the investors pay in fees.
Mutual funds are highly regulated in terms of the amount 
they can charge in fees and the types of fees they can 
charge. (For instance, 12b-1 fees are those related to the 
administrative functions of the fund and are capped by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.)
Shares
Hedge funds pool the assets of 
the investors collectively and 
invest them.
Mutual funds sell shares of a pool, which is either indefi-
nite, meaning that there are no restrictions on the number 
of shares issued and that the fund buys back shares as 
they are sold by investors, or traded like stocks, depending 
on whether the mutual fund is open-end or closed-end, 
respectively.

24      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
Business credit institutions
Did you know that corporations can get credit cards and credit loans just as you 
can? Well, they can, and those credit loans come from a type of financing institu-
tion called a business credit institution. Business credit loans differ from standard 
business loans in that they’re a running line of credit in the same way that your 
credit card is a running line of credit. These loans can be freely increased or grad-
ually paid off within certain limits as long as the corporation makes periodic min-
imum payments on the balance.
A special type of business credit institution, called a captive financing company, is a 
company that’s owned by another organization and that handles the financing 
and credit only for that organization rather than for any applicants. For example, 
GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors, which changed its name to Ally Bank, 
is the captive credit financing company for the corporation General Motors.
Loan sharks and subprime lenders
All the lending I talk about in this chapter has been at the prime rate, which is the 
interest rate charged to customers who are considered to be of little or no risk of 
defaulting. In the United States, the prime rate is about 3 percent above the  
interest rate that banks charge each other, called the federal funds rate. (Some 
nations use LIBOR, which is the London Interbank Offered Rate.) For those corpo-
rations and people who are considered higher risk, they will often qualify for only 
loans considered subprime, which are offered at interest rates higher than the 
prime rate.
Another form of high-interest loan is called the payday loan. The payday loan 
basically makes loan sharks legal (organizations that offer loans at rates above the 
legal level and who often have heavy-handed tactics). The payday loan gives you 
money for a short period, usually only one to two weeks, and charges several hun-
dred percent in annual percentage rate, in addition to fees and penalties. Rather 
than breaking your knees, as the stereotype suggests, these lenders simply anni-
hilate your credit score and financial well-being. As a result, many states have 
outlawed these lenders.
For a period between the 1980s and 1990s, subprime mortgage lenders were also 
very common. In fact, they contributed to the 2007 financial collapse, when many 
commercial banks were venturing into the subprime market with little or inap-
propriate risk management. Bottom line: Avoid loan sharks and subprime lenders 
at all costs, or they’ll ruin your finances and the greater economy at large.

CHAPTER 2  Introducing Finance Land      25
Exchanges
Exchanges such as the NASDAQ, NYSE, Nikkei, and others are globally renowned 
for being open forums for ferocious trading. In both stock and commodities 
exchanges, the most recognized space is called the pit, or trading floor, and it’s 
where large numbers of brokers and dealers shout and scream at each other, buy-
ing, selling, and trading shares of this or that. Of course, computers are now 
replacing much of this in-your-face activity. Even on the trading floor itself, 
computers are becoming ever present, while the number of people who vigorously 
declare their intentions to anyone within a two-mile radius is quickly shrinking. 
The function of the exchanges themselves is more about providing a place for 
these trading activities to occur than anything, making them increasingly irrele-
vant with modern technological advances in investing transactions.
Regulatory bodies
Numerous regulatory bodies oversee corporate finances and financial institutions, 
and each one warrants its own book (in fact, the role and regulations encompass-
ing each regulatory body span volumes of books of information). I obviously can’t 
fit all that information in this book, so I just cover the basics of the main regula-
tory bodies here. Armed with their names and main purposes, you can do a quick 
online search to find out more about the ones that interest you most.
»
» Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Sets the standards for corpo-
rate public financial reporting, the rules for investment, and the regulations 
for securities exchanges
»
» Internal Revenue Service (IRS): Handles all tax reporting, tax accounting, tax 
collection, and pretty much all taxation issues other than determining the tax 
rates
»
» Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA): A nongovernmental 
organization that’s in charge of setting and enforcing regulations among its 
member groups, which include brokerage firms and exchange markets
»
» Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): The government body 
that regulates derivatives trading
»
» Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): One of the few private 
corporations owned by the United States; sells insurance to depository 
institutions, ensuring that the deposits of each person be insured up to 
$250,000 in the event that something happened to the institution
»
» Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC): Part of the U.S. Treasury; 
regulates all national commercial banks

26      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
»
» National Credit Union Administration (NCUA): A government-backed 
organization that regulates credit unions
»
» American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA): The profes-
sional organization that regulates all certified public accountants
»
» Chartered Financial Analyst Institute (CFAI): The professional organization 
that regulates all chartered financial analysts
»
» Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB): A nonprofit organization 
that creates the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that are used 
for all public accounting in the United States.
»
» Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB): The non-profit organiza-
tion that regulates the accounting of state and local governments
»
» Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB): An advisory 
committee that regulates accounting standards for the U.S. federal 
government
»
» Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF): The organization that provides 
oversight and regulation for other regulatory and professional bodies such as 
the AICPA, CFAI, and GASB
These are just U.S. regulatory bodies. Many more bodies provide oversight and 
regulation around the world. Plus, many nations are beginning to adopt interna-
tional accounting standards (IAS), which may limit the need for individual national 
accounting standards; however, the standards boards will likely remain in most 
nations even after they adapt IAS. Looking at all the regulatory bodies that regu-
late other regulatory bodies, I believe that the industry as a whole may welcome 
some streamlining — not less regulation, necessarily (that’s a far more compli-
cated debate), but less bureaucracy.
Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury
I’ve heard a lot of conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve in my days in 
corporate finance. Even among a small minority of fringe economists (namely, 
the Austrian school of macroeconomics), a lot of people misconceive the actual 
role of the Federal Reserve. These misconceptions and conspiracy theories are a 
little odd, considering the actions of the Federal Reserve are all quite transparent. 
Its reports are all available for public view, its actions are all over the news each 
day, and the public can even see its hearings on TV sometimes. The Fed, as it’s 
often called, actually has very limited power, so some of the conspiracies that 
exist tend to be nothing more than fantasy.

CHAPTER 2  Introducing Finance Land      27
In contrast, the U.S. Treasury is practically immune to conspiracy because it’s just 
an arm of the bigger federal government. The corruption usually exists among 
those with higher authority (the Treasury isn’t really a decision-making body). 
The following sections take a brief look at each of these government entities.
Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve isn’t a part of the federal government at all. It’s 
­quasi-­governmental, which means it performs functions related to managing the 
U.S. economy in cooperation with the government but isn’t actually under the 
direct control of any government body. Think of the Federal Reserve as the bank 
that other banks go to when they need banking services.
The Fed accepts deposits, makes loans to member banks, and facilitates loans 
between banks using the deposits. It also determines interest rates for certain key 
loans and the bank reserve requirement, which is the proportion of total deposits 
that commercial banks must keep available as liquid cash. Bank reserve require-
ments are used to manage bank liquidity for customer withdrawals and to manage 
the supply of money in the nation as a whole. The Fed generates funds by charging 
interest and by charging member banks a membership fee.
The controversy and confusion comes into play as the Federal Reserve receives 
money from the U.S. Treasury and then lends it out to member banks. The setting 
of interest rates is also one of the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve.
The reality is that the Federal Reserve is simply acting as a middleman for the 
distribution of funds, although the government can distribute funds without help 
from the Federal Reserve by way of spending more money through hiring con-
tractors or distributing stimulus spending (like the new homebuyer’s tax credit). 
Banks tend to only purchase money from the Federal Reserve when they need to 
increase the total amount of money available, because interbank loans are a cheap, 
fast, and easy way to handle short-term shortages of money in reserve.
What do corporations need to know about the Fed? Because it sets the rates that 
other banks pay to borrow money, it also indirectly controls the rates that banks 
will charge customers. After all, banks always charge rates higher than they, 
themselves, pay. The Fed also plays a large role in controlling money supply. In 
short, the Fed is in charge of U.S. monetary policy, so most of what I cover in this 
finance book is directly related to the actions of the Fed.

28      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
U.S. Treasury
The U.S. Treasury is a division of the U.S. government and is, quite possibly, the 
simplest arm of the U.S. government to understand, at least regarding finance. 
The U.S.  Treasury isn’t a decision-making body, so the actions it takes must 
always be set in motion by the federal government — either Congress, the presi-
dent, the Supreme Court, or some combination of the three. For instance, the 
Treasury distributes payments on behalf of the federal government, but it doesn’t 
make those payments on its own. Congress sets the budget for each branch of the 
government, and when the branches spend that money, the Treasury’s job is to 
distribute the allotted funds.
That being said, the Treasury is in charge of distributing government funds, col-
lecting revenues by way of the IRS, issuing government debt (by selling Treasury 
bonds, Treasury notes, and Treasury bills, which are how government debt is 
generated), printing new money, and destroying old/damaged/faulty money.
What you need to know about the Treasury is that it’s where your government 
bonds and risk-free investments come from and it’s where your payments come 
from if you own government investments or do any contracting work for the fed-
eral government, as many corporations do.
Getting a Job in Finance Land
As with most places in the world, your visit to Finance Land will be a short one 
unless you can find work. The following sections outline some roles to consider in 
this land of other peoples’ money.
Accounts payable and/or receivable
Accounts payable specialist and accounts receivable specialist sound like they 
should be similar roles. In terms of the basic paperwork and function, they are 
quite alike. An accounts payable specialist manages paying bills that are due, 
while the accounts receivable specialist collects money that is owed. The real sig-
nificant difference is that paying bills is a lot easier than collecting money from 
people who owe, so accounts receivable quickly turns into a role of debt collection. 
It’s not a bad entry-level position to get started in the finance, though.

CHAPTER 2  Introducing Finance Land      29
HR and payroll
This role is very much the liaison between Finance Land and the employees of a 
company who generally haven’t specialized in finance. Paychecks and benefits 
and retirement accounts and insurance stuff and time off — they are all handled 
here. This role has a greater customer service feel to it, so it helps to be a “people 
person,” as they say.
Analysts
Analysts have the best job in the financial world, as far as I’m concerned. These 
people get to do a whole lot of research and analysis to derive useful information 
from data or otherwise yet unstudied scenarios. Normally, analysts receive budget 
information or corporate financial information and are told to do the calculations 
necessary to make recommendations. Often these projects are fairly broad, and 
analysts have to model new forms of calculations, assess market trends, and make 
other similar efforts that require a degree of creativity and innovation.
Auditors
As you’re typing on the computer, if you spell a word incorrectly, spell-check will 
likely correct you. Auditors are kind of like the spell-checkers for corporate finance. 
They go back and check the work of all the other financial professionals, making 
sure everything is accurate, correct, and done properly. They’re also usually the 
ones who discover cases of fraud or embezzlement. A special type of auditing, 
wherein auditors do their calculations for the purpose of presenting them in court, 
is called forensic accounting.
Adjusters
Adjusters are people who work for insurance companies and analyze your insur-
ance claim to determine how much the insurance company will pay for damages 
and whether your claim is fraudulent or real. Any claim large enough for a corpo-
ration to file is guaranteed to attract an adjustor inspection.
Bookkeepers and accountants
“Bean counters” is the phrase used to refer to this role which, although one of the 
most vital in Finance Land, can be just as boring as it sounds. In this role, you keep 
track of the movement of all money, make records, file reports, and make sure 
everyone on the planet knows exactly what has happened with the money you are 
keeping track of.

30      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
Get a degree in accounting and then pursue your CPA to become a rock star in this 
field.
Modelers and scientists
These folks take the data collected by accountants and others and run all kinds of 
quantitative analysis on it to turn that data into useful information. If you like 
math, statistics, and computer coding, this is a very lucrative field to pursue.
Economists and consultants
Finance is only one subdiscipline of economics. Economists, as a result, do similar 
work to financial analysts but on a much broader scale that encompass more than 
money-related items. Consultants, too, are experienced experts, either directly in 
the field of finance or some field that complements finance. In both cases, they 
provide clarity, information, and guidance necessary for the proper application of 
financial management. The focus on these people isn’t so much about money 
itself, but the resources that the money represents.
Traders
The term trader refers to anyone who makes a living by buying and selling invest-
ments with great frequency. Unlike investors, who purchase investments with the 
intention of holding onto them for an extended period of time with the expecta-
tion that they’ll rise in value, traders hold onto investments just long enough for 
them to rise in value a little bit and then sell them at a profit. Really, any schmuck 
can try to be a trader; some will succeed and others will fail. The only requirement 
is that you have some starting capital (in other words, money).
Work on getting your Series 7 license and perfecting your networking skills to 
make it as a professional trader of any kind.
Treasurers
Treasurers are the people in charge of managing financial assets. In other words, 
they’re responsible for keeping track of cash management, foreign exchange, 
pension management, and capital structure. Don’t worry; I discuss all these topics 
in much greater detail throughout the book. Often treasurers are also in charge of 
risk management, although this responsibility is sometimes given a separate 
position, depending on the company. (See Part 4 for more on risk management.)

CHAPTER 2  Introducing Finance Land      31
Bankers and more
The nature of banking depends entirely on the type of banking a person does, but 
there are similar functions between them. Personal and commercial bankers han-
dle the logistics of executing transactions for deposits, loans, some kinds of 
investments, some kinds of valuations, and so on. An investment banker deals 
with the logistics of assessing the value of a corporation, making sure the corpo-
ration gets paid for its shares, and selling those shares to private investors. Tellers 
work in banks and simply handle the counting and movement of money between 
people and/or accounts. Banking, as a whole, is really nothing more than manag-
ing basic money needs for others.
“Financial advisors” are not financial experts, despite the word “finance” in the 
title. It is their role to sell financial products and services, and they earn more 
money as you make more transactions. There have been attempts to pass a fidu-
ciary rule that would require financial advisors to act in the best interest of their 
clients, but these attempts have been reversed.
Visiting the Finance Land Information 
Center
Are you still feeling lost in Finance Land? Have you read this book (and all the 
other books written by yours truly) and are still feeling like a 2-year-old lost in 
the mall? Fortunately, you can go to plenty of other places for additional informa-
tion. But be careful, because Finance Land is filled with people who give terrible 
advice. Think of this portion of the book as your guide map: It helps point you in 
the right direction for more exploration.
Internet sources
The Internet, with its seemingly unlimited ability to provide free, reliable infor-
mation, has become a great resource tool for people involved in corporate finance. 
However, you have to be careful when using online sources because some of them 
don’t verify their accuracy, and you definitely don’t want to be misled or lied to. 
Here are just a few sources you can trust:
»
» EDGAR: This is the SEC’s database website, which provides easy access to a 
huge number of financial reports by public companies listed in the U.S. Check 
it out at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml.

32      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
»
» Investopedia: This online encyclopedia focuses exclusively on issues related 
to corporate finance and investing. Go to http://www.investopedia.com 
for more details.
»
» University websites: Many university websites publish beginner’s guides, 
course supplements, and other information useful for people with a range of 
understanding in corporate finance. These resources can be difficult to find 
on the websites themselves, though, so your best bet is to find them using a 
search engine. Just type a search for the concept you’re researching; if any of 
the websites have an .edu domain, then that’s probably a good reference.
»
» Publisher websites: Many book publishers, particularly for textbooks, 
provide supplementary information and resources on their websites.
Print sources
A number of different print sources are also available to help you learn more about 
corporate finance:
»
» Books: The one you’re reading right now is a great place to start! You’ll also 
find several other books in the For Dummies series. You can also check out 
some of my other books (search for Michael Taillard). If you’re looking for 
more, ask your librarian to help point you in the right direction. Particularly, 
librarians at universities can be extremely helpful because they have lots of 
books geared to students who are studying the same things as you.
»
» Magazines: CFO, Kiplinger, Global Finance, Public Finance, Money, Strategic 
Finance, and so many others can be great resources. The topic of corporate 
finance seems to sell a lot of magazines.
»
» Journals: Academic and professional journals are an amazing source of 
information and are particularly nice because the work is all peer-reviewed for 
accuracy and legitimacy. The problem is they also tend to include extremely 
advanced information — not for the beginner!
»
» Financial reports: All financial reports made by companies publicly listed in 
the United States are available for free on request or at many libraries.

Human sources
Finding the right people to talk to about corporate finance can be difficult, espe-
cially when the people who talk the most are the ones who know the least and the 
ones who know the most are the hardest to find. Here are a few tips to help you 
get the best, most useful information from the finance people you talk to:
»
» Never trust someone giving you a stock tip!
»
» Understand the nature of the person’s job, and if they keep trying to give you

Pitching Your Story 
for Money
O
ne of the first, and most challenging, goals for a corporation is to acquire 
things of value, starting with cash. Using that cash, the company then 
purchases other things such as equipment, supplies, and so on. This 
chapter explores the different ways that corporations raise money, who the mag-
ical money-fairies are, and how to present your story to them in a way that pleases 
them.
Raising Capital
Everything that makes up a corporation and everything a corporation owns, 
including the building, equipment, office supplies, brand value, research, land, 
trademarks, and everything else, are considered assets. Believe it or not, when you 
start a corporation, that company’s assets aren’t just included in a Welcome Let-
ter; you have to go out and acquire them. Generally speaking, you start off with 
cash, which you then use to purchase other assets. For most new companies, this 
cash consists of a combination of the following:
»
» The owner’s own money: This money is considered equity because the 
owner can still claim full possession over it.

» Small loans, such as business and personal loans from banks, business 
and personal lines of credit, and government loans: The money obtained 
through loans is considered a liability because the corporation has to pay it 
back at some point. In other words, these loans are a form of debt.
The combination of these two funding sources brings me to the explanation of the 
most fundamental equation in corporate finance:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
The total value of assets held by a company is equal to the total liabilities and total 
equity held by the company. Because the total amount of debt a company incurs 
goes into purchasing equipment and supplies, increasing debt through loans 
increases a company’s liabilities and total assets. As owners contribute their own 
funding to the company’s usage, the total amount of company equity increases 
along with the assets. Note: Capital, assets, money, and cash are basically all the 
same thing at this point; after a company raises the original capital, or cash, it 
exchanges that cash for more useful forms of capital, such as erasable markers.
Unlike liabilities, equity represents ownership in the company. So, if a company 
owns $100,000 in assets and $50,000 was funded by loans, then the owner still 
holds claim over $50,000 in assets, even if the company goes out of business, 
requiring the owner to give the other $50,000 in assets back to the bank. For cor-
porations, the equity funding varies a bit, however, because the owners of a cor-
poration are the stockholders. The equity funding of corporations comes from the 
initial sale of stock, which exchanges shares of ownership for cash to be used in 
the company.
The rest of this chapter discusses the two main ways businesses raise capital.
Diving into Debt
When a corporation needs money, one of the primary options it has available is to 
borrow some. Now, I’m not talking about borrowing a few hundred bucks from a 
friend or family member; I’m talking about borrowing an amount of money suf-
ficient enough to fund the startup of a new company, the expansion of an existing 
company, the purchase of expensive equipment, or the acquisition of another 
company. Loan requests are very much defined by the numbers being presented to 
lenders. How much are you asking, what percentage of the total are you providing 

CHAPTER 3  Pitching Your Story for Money      37
yourself, what is the business’s history of revenues, how likely are you to repay 
the debt, and so on. The story you tell here must be entirely nonfiction, written 
strictly in numbers.
Regardless of what the money’s for, when a corporation wants a loan, it starts by 
putting together a proposal. For startup companies, this proposal comes in the 
form of a business plan, but anytime a corporation receives a loan significant 
enough to influence the capital structure of the company (not lines of credit), it 
has to present a proposal for the use of the funds. This proposal includes financial 
information about the corporation, including detailed predictions for future 
financial well-being, called projections, that prove the company can pay back the 
loan on time and without risk of default. For more information about business 
plans, which you can use in many forms of proposals, you may want to read Busi-
ness Plans For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) by Paul Tiffany, PhD, Steven 
D. Peterson, PhD, and Colin Barrow.
The following sections explain what a corporation must do after its proposal is 
ready to go, including where to go to ask for money and how to evaluate the worth 
of a loan and its terms.
Asking the right people for money
After the proposal is in place, corporations have a few options for where to go to 
ask for the money they need:
»
» Commercial banks: Banks are very common sources for corporate debt 
financing. These loans work very similar to any other loan, wherein your 
ability and planned use of the funds will both be evaluated in detail before the 
bank agrees to offer the loan. The findings of their investigation will deter-
mine, in part, the interest rate they will charge, the amount they will loan, and 
the duration of the loan.
»
» Government loans: These loans are frequently available, but they’re often 
reserved for special types of corporations (usually in a field that the govern-
ment is trying to promote), corporations with a special role in the nation (such 
as defense contractors).
»
» Issuance of bonds: Bonds, which basically act as IOUs, are possibly the most 
popular form of debt financing. A company goes through an underwriter to 
have bonds issued, and then private investors purchase those bonds. The 
company keeps the money raised as capital with a promise that it’ll pay back 
the bondholders’ money with interest. Bonds come in many different flavors; 
turn to Chapter 11 for more details.

38      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
After a potential moneylender receives the corporation’s loan application, an 
interview process typically occurs, along with an underwriting process during 
which the potential lender assesses the borrower for risk, financial ability to repay 
the loan, credit history, and other variables. If the lender approves the loan appli-
cation, the money is deposited in the corporation’s bank account, making it avail-
able for use by the corporation in a manner consistent with the original 
proposal.
Making sure the loan pays off in the 
long run
The responsibility for making sure a particular loan is beneficial to a company lies 
with that company. Every loan, except for those rare federally subsidized loans in 
which the government pays for the interest, incurs interest, meaning you and 
your company pay more money back to the lender than the lender originally 
gave you.
Here’s a quick look at how interest works:
B
P
r
t
(
)
1
This equation says that the balance (B) is equal to the principal amount (P) times 
the rate (r) exponentially multiplied by time (t). So, if your company borrowed 
$100 at an interest rate of 10 percent for one year without making any payments, 
then the amount of money your company owes at the end of that one year looks 
like this:
B
100 1
0 1
1
.
The answer, then, is $110 (because $10 is 10 percent of $100 and interest is accrued 
annually for only one year).
When accepting a loan, the goal of every company is to make absolutely sure that 
it can generate more returns from spending the money borrowed than the interest 
rate being charged. After all, by keeping the loan, the corporation agrees to pay 
back interest as well as the principal. So, if your company spends the money it 
borrowed in the preceding example on a new machine, it has to generate more 
than 10 percent profitability from that single machine in order to make the loan 
worth the 10 percent interest rate. This is a simplified example that doesn’t take 
several real-world variables into consideration, but before you consider more 
realistic examples you need to learn about some additional topics.

CHAPTER 3  Pitching Your Story for Money      39
If a company absolutely must raise capital but can’t generate enough value to pay 
back the interest rate, it’ll end up losing money on the loan. As a result, it might 
want to pursue an alternative option for raising capital, such as selling equity.
Looking at loan terms
You have a few different options available when choosing a loan for your com-
pany. To make the best choice for your company, you need to be aware of the pros 
and cons of each loan type. If you’re not sure which one is best for you, ask a pro-
fessional analyst  — not the person trying to sell you the loan. Here are some 
terms you need to be aware of:
»
» Fixed versus variable rate: When you take out a fixed-rate loan, the percent-
age interest you pay will always be the same. For example, if you take out a 
loan with 5 percent APR (annual percentage rate, which is your annual interest 
rate), then you will always be charged 5 percent interest per year. With a 
variable rate loan, the interest rate you pay will change; the amount of change 
depends on the type of loan. Variable rate loans come in many types, and 
their rates change based on another interest rate, a stock market index, your 
income, or some other indicator. Some increase gradually over time, while 
others start low and jump after a period of time (these are called teaser-rates).
While the wide variety of variable rate loan options is great news for the 
financially inclined, these types of loans can be very dangerous for beginners. 
The amount of information and the calculations involved in predicting the 
movement in variable interest rates can be a deceptively daunting task, even 
for experienced analysts.
»
» Secured versus unsecured: Secured loans are tied to some asset, which 
becomes collateral. Basically, you tell the bank that if you fail to pay back your 
loan, the bank can keep and/or sell that particular asset to get its money back. 
With unsecured loans, no assets are directly considered to be collateral to 
which the lender has automatic rights upon the borrower’s default of the loan. 
However, they can still hurt the credit history of the company, and a lender 
can still sue to get their money back.
»
» Open-ended versus closed-ended: Closed-ended loans are your standard 
loans. After your company gets one, it makes periodic payments for a 
predetermined time period, and then the loan is paid back, and you and the 
lender are both done. Think of a closed-ended loan like a mortgage, except 
that it’s not used to buy a house. Open-ended loans are more similar to credit 
cards. Your company can draw upon an open-ended loan until it reaches a 
maximum limit, and it just continuously makes payments for as long as it has 
a balance.

40      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
»
» Simple versus compounding interest: Simple interest accrues based only on 
the principal loan. In other words, if a loan for $100 charges 1 percent interest, 
the lender will make $1 every period. On the other hand, compounding interest 
pays interest on interest. So, if the borrower doesn’t make any payments on a 
loan of $100 with 1 percent interest in the first year, then the loan will charge 
1 percent interest on $101 rather than the original $100 the second year. This 
type of interest is far more common with bank accounts than loans. (Turn to 
Chapter 9 for more on these two types of interest.)
If a company were to go out of business, any money raised by selling assets will 
first go to pay lenders.
Schmoozing Investors
Raising money by selling shares of equity is a little more complicated both in 
theory and in practice than borrowing money using loans. What you are actually 
doing when you sell equity is selling bits of ownership in a company. Ownership 
of the company is split up into shares called stock. People only buy stocks when 
they are excited by the things they hear about them, so your story has to be par-
ticularly good when compared to the relatively number-driven world of loans. 
Although it is illegal to say anything fictional, it is common to share a company’s 
vision of their future with potential investors, providing a bigger emotional 
impact.
When you own stock in a company, you own a part of that company equal to the 
proportion of the number of shares of stock you own compared to the total num-
ber of stock shares. For example, if a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstand-
ing (meaning that this is the total number of shares of stock that make up the 
entire company) and you own one share, then you own 0.1 percent of that com-
pany, including any profits or losses it experiences (because profits belong to the 
owners of the company). So, when you sell equity to raise cash, what you’re really 
selling are the rights to a certain amount of control over how the company is 
managed in addition to your rights to the future profits of that company.
Selling stock to the public
When a company is getting ready to go public, meaning it’s opening up the pur-
chase of equity to the public, it must first put all its records and reports in the 
proper format. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that 
all U.S. public companies follow specific criteria for keeping track of financial 
information and reporting it to the public. The company must also meet a number 

CHAPTER 3  Pitching Your Story for Money      41
of accountability requirements and other more minor requirements. In other 
words, before becoming a corporation, a business must act like a corporation. 
Often this includes hiring a consultant or an investment banker to help make sure 
everything is in order. Then, finally, the company can go through the process of 
becoming established as a corporation and selling stock.
The easiest way to become a corporation is to go through a full-service invest-
ment bank. Often the investment bank can take a company through all the steps, 
including legally reorganizing the company as a corporation, registering with the 
proper regulatory authorities, underwriting, and selling stock on the primary 
market. The legal reorganization process alone is well beyond the scope of this 
book; I recommend just asking a lawyer.
During the underwriting stage, an underwriter evaluates the value of the company 
and estimates how much the company needs to raise, how much it should raise, 
and how much it’s likely to raise. That same person verifies that the company 
meets all the requirements for being a corporation and selling stock. After that, 
the company can have its first IPO.
An IPO, or initial public offering, occurs when a company sells stock to the public. 
The IPO is when selling stock raises money for the company. After all, the com-
pany will use the money that people pay to own stock to purchase things the 
company needs to operate or expand. The people who buy stock from the company 
during the IPO make up the primary market because they take part in the initial sale 
of stock. After the initial stock is sold to the public, it can be resold over and over 
again, but the company itself doesn’t make any more money. The subsequent 
selling of stock is just an exchange of ownership between investors for a price 
negotiated between those same investors. The exchange of stock between inves-
tors is called the secondary market; it doesn’t raise any more money for the 
company.
Any company, old or new, can have an IPO. All it means is that new stock has been 
created and registered and is being sold for the first time. If an old corporation 
decides it wants to raise more money and it thinks investors are willing to pay for 
more stock, then it can have another IPO to sell new stock that will just add to the 
total amount of stock the company has on the market.

42      PART 1  What’s Unique about Corporate Finance
Looking at the different types of stock
Like most aspects of corporate finance, stocks come in many varieties, but no 
matter which type of stock your corporation has, its value increases or decreases 
based on the performance of your corporation. Here are three of the main stock 
types, along with their distinguishing characteristics:
»
» Common stock: If you hold common stock in a corporation, you’re a partial 
owner, so you get to vote in any decisions regarding company policy, the 
board of directors, and many other issues. Keep in mind that to be brought to 
a vote, an issue usually needs to be instigated by one stockholder and then 
supported by others, at which point a voting form goes out to all stockholders 
of that company to fill out and return.
Holding common stock also gives you rights to a share of dividend payments 
(profits returned to the company owners) when they’re issued, although this is 
optional. In case of company liquidation (selling assets after going out of 
business), common shareholders get whatever value is left over after the 
lenders and preferred shareholders get what they’re owed. Finally, holding 
common stock gives you the right to receive specialized reports or analytics 
from the company.
»
» Preferred stock: If you hold preferred stock in a corporation, you get your 
dividend payouts in full before common shareholders get even a dime. That 
holds true for liquidation as well. As with common stock, being a preferred 
shareholder gives you the right to get information from a company. But the 
key difference between common and preferred shareholders is that preferred 
shareholders don’t have voting rights. So, although they have a right to the 
ownership and success of a company, they have no voice or control over the 
actions the company takes.
»
» Treasury stock: When a company issues common shares of stock, it has the 
opportunity to repurchase those shares on the secondary market as any 
investor does. When a company does so, those common shares become 
treasury shares. The stock itself hasn’t changed at all; it’s just owned by the 
company that the stock represents. So, in essence, the company owns itself, 
which is only one step away from becoming completely self-aware and 
destroying us all! Companies tend to do this (buy treasury stock, not destroy 
us all) because they can generate income in the same way that many inves-
tors do, but buying treasury stock also allows them to manage their stock 
price more effectively.

CHAPTER 3  Pitching Your Story for Money      43
Another stock-related term you need to know, though it isn’t a type of stock per 
se, is stock split. A stock split occurs when a company takes all of its common 
shares of stock and splits them into pieces. For example, say a person had  
one share of stock worth $10 before a stock split. After the split, that person has 
two shares of stock each worth $5. Companies use stock splits to increase the 
liquidity of stock shares, making them easier to buy and sell and, in the long run, 
driving up the total value. Note that this process can easily backfire if there isn’t 
already a demand for a company’s stock from people who would buy it at the 
cheaper post-split rate.
Having Your Wish Granted
Depending on the type of industry you are in, and the interests of those with 
money, you might be eligible for grants. There are grants from different govern-
ment organizations, grants from other businesses, grants from universities, 
grants from special interest groups, and so forth. Generally, they will tell you 
exactly the kind of work/project they are willing to provide grant function for, in 
addition to the requirements and process for applying. Ideally, you have an expe-
rienced grant writer assist you, but if not, then be prepared to present extensive 
budgeting and operating information and explain how you can best meet the 
needs of the organization providing the grant money.
Options for raising money — like private investors, angel investors, crowdsourc-
ing, and so on — are exciting and popular paths for small businesses to pursue, 
but provide almost no real opportunities unless you first develop relationships 
within those social circles. It’s best to stick with traditional methods of raising 
capital until your story becomes more well known among these unorthodox 
routes.

or every give, there is a take. For every expenditure or liability, there is an 
asset of equivalent value. All of business finance must be in balance, and this 
is reflected nowhere better than on the balance sheet. The balance sheet is a 
financial report that’s useful to anyone who has even the slightest interest in a 
business, including management, investors, lenders, business students, union 
representatives, and all other stakeholders. In short, the balance sheet includes 
important stuff, so pay attention to this chapter!
Introducing the Balance Sheet
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that all corporations 
maintain a balance sheet and highly recommends that any business keep one (the 
distinction being that corporations are publicly-owned companies that are legally 
required to fulfill these reporting obligations to its shareholders and other 
regulators).
After all, the SEC’s main purpose is to illustrate the exact value of a company in 
the very moment that the data are collected. Unlike other financial reports, the 
balance sheet doesn’t compile data over a period of time. Instead, it reports the 
value of all the assets the company currently has, divided into relevant categories, 
and then also includes the value of the company’s liabilities and owners’ equity, 
each divided in a manner similar to assets.

48      PART 2  Making a Statement
Here’s the basic formula for the balance sheet:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity
So the total value of all assets equals the total value of all liabilities plus all own-
ers’ equity. If the two sides of the equation don’t balance, then someone did 
something wrong, and it’s time for some no-holds-barred combat accounting! 
Hooah!
Evaluating the Weights on the 
Balance Scale
Everything of value in a company falls into three primary categories. Each of these 
categories represents a portion of the balance sheet:
»
» Assets: Assets include anything of value that currently belongs to the company 
or is currently owed to the company. Remember that the company purchases 
all assets by using capital acquired by incurring debt and selling ownership, so 
the total assets must balance with the cumulative totals of the other two 
portions of the balance sheet (see the next two bullets).
»
» Liabilities: Liabilities include the value of all the company’s debt that must be 
repaid.
»
» Owners’ equity: Owners’ equity includes all the value that the company holds 
for its stockholders.
Each portion of the balance sheet begins with the things that are the most liquid 
at the top. In other words, the top of each portion includes the things that either 
must be or otherwise can be converted to cash the quickest. As you make your way 
down each portion, the items included gradually become either decreasingly liq-
uid or require repayment for longer periods of time.
Liquidity refers to the relative ease with which assets are turned into cash. Cash is 
clearly more liquid than capital assets like machinery, which must be sold to 
acquire cash, for example. When a company has become unable to turn their 
assets into cash in a time period necessary to pay their bills and continue opera-
tions, the company is said to be insolvent.

CHAPTER 4  Staying Balanced      49
Understanding Assets
Assets include the value of everything the company owns and everything the 
company is owed. Assets fall into two main categories:
»
» Current assets: Current assets are those assets that a company expects to 
turn into cash within one year or, for inventories that take more than a year to 
turn into cash (such as buildings, vehicles, and other things that are usually 
expensive items), those assets a company expects to sell within one year.
»
» Long-term assets: Long-term assets are those assets that will take more than 
one year to turn into cash or that are otherwise not intended to be sold yet 
(but can be sold, if necessary).
Note that a few assets don’t fall into either of these categories. That’s where the 
last two sections of the assets portion come into play — intangible assets and 
other assets. I discuss both later in this section.
Current assets
This section outlines the subsections of the current assets portion of the balance 
sheet from the most liquid to least liquid.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are the most liquid assets a company has available. In 
other words, they’re the assets that the company can most easily turn into cash 
because, well, they’re already cash. Cash refers to the money a company has on 
hand, while cash equivalents refer to savings accounts and such, from which the 
company can withdrawal cash quite easily, although at times the bank can tem-
porarily restrict access.
Marketable securities
The second most liquid asset that a company has available is everything that falls 
into the category of marketable securities, including banker’s acceptances, certifi-
cates of deposit (CDs), Treasury bills, and other types of financial products that 
have maturity dates but that companies can withdraw from or sell very easily if 
necessary.

50      PART 2  Making a Statement
Accounts receivable
The accounts receivable category includes the value of all money owed to a company 
within the next year. Note the important distinction between money that’s owed 
in the next year and money that’s likely to be paid. Unfortunately, sometimes 
people refuse to pay what they owe. In these cases, the receivable remains receiv-
able until either the money is paid or the period in which the money is due passes.
After the period passes, the company subtracts the value of the account owed from 
accounts receivable and transfers it to a subaccount called allowances. Allowances 
include the value of the money that’s still owed and past due but has yet to be 
written off as uncollectible (which is considered an expense). Usually, the accounts 
receivable entry looks something like this:
Receivables net
XX
 Allowances
XX
Receivables gross
:
$
:
$
:
$XX
Inventories
The inventories category includes the value of all supplies that a company intends 
to use up during the process of making and selling something. Inventories include 
the raw materials used in production, the work-in-process products (partially 
completed products), end products ready for sale, and even basic office supplies 
and goods consumed in production (such as stationary used in offices, oil carried 
on delivery trucks for regular maintenance, and so on).
Income tax assets
Income tax assets include two forms of income taxes. The first is one that many 
people are familiar with: tax returns. When a company is set to receive money 
back on its taxes, that money becomes a short-term asset until the company 
receives it, at which point it becomes cash.
The other form of tax asset is the deferred tax, which occurs when a company has 
met the requirements to receive a tax benefit but has yet to receive it. For example, 
a company that experiences losses one year can file those losses the next year 
rather than the current year, so the value of its losses would be a deferred income 
tax asset that would decrease any income tax owed the next year.
Prepaid accounts
When a company pays for some expense in advance, the value of that prepayment 
becomes an asset (called a prepaid account) for which the company will receive 

CHAPTER 4  Staying Balanced      51
services in the future. Consider insurance as an example. If a company prepays its 
insurance for a full year, the full dollar amount paid will add to the value of the 
company’s prepaid accounts. Every month, the company decreases 1 12 of the value 
of that prepaid account (each month the company uses up one month’s worth of 
value). In other words, the company uses up its prepaid accounts as the service it 
paid for is provided.
Other current assets
The other current assets category is a rather common one to find on the balance 
sheet, but it means different things to different companies. Generally, it’s an 
all-inclusive category for any assets that are expected to turn into cash within a 
one-year period but that aren’t listed elsewhere on the balance sheet. Other cur-
rent assets may include restricted cash, certain types of investments, collateral, 
and pretty much anything else you can think of.
Long-term assets
The long-term assets section includes three main categories  — investments, 
property, plant, and equipment (PPE), and depreciation. I describe each of these 
in more detail in the following sections.
Investments
Long-term investments typically include equities and debt investments held by the 
company for financial gain, for gaining control over another company, or in funds 
such as pensions. It can also include facilities or equipment intended for lease or 
rent. In any case, all the investments in this section are meant to be held for more 
than one year.
Note: Sometimes a company lists its bond investments as notes receivables, which 
are reported sort of like accounts receivables, except with the expectations of 
receiving payments in the long term.
Property, plant, and equipment
The property, plant, and equipment (PPE) category includes nearly every major 
physical asset a company has that it will use for more than one year. Buildings, 
machinery, land, major furniture, computer equipment, company vehicles, and 
even construction-in-progress projects all qualify as PPE. Basically, if you can 
touch it and plan to use it for more than a single year, it contributes to the value 
of PPE.

52      PART 2  Making a Statement
Depreciation
The long-term physical assets included in PPE don’t last forever. With age and 
usage, every long-term physical asset is subject to depreciation, or a decrease in 
value. Different companies measure depreciation in different ways (some of which 
I discuss later in this section), but regardless of the manner in which a company 
measures depreciation, the total shows up on the balance sheet as a subtraction 
from the total value of PPE. It looks something like this:
PPE net
XX
 Depreciation
XX
PPE gross
XX
:
$
:
$
:
$
A company may choose to leave out the gross PPE line because it doesn’t contrib-
ute anything to the value of the total assets (and because you can calculate it eas-
ily, given the other information listed).
What follows are two of the most common methods for calculating depreciation.
Straight-line and unit-of-production depreciation
The easiest type of depreciation to use is called straight-line depreciation. Straight-
line depreciation is cumulative, meaning that if you report a value in depreciation 
for a piece of equipment one year, that same amount gets added to the next year’s 
depreciation, and so on, until you get rid of the equipment or its value drops to 
0.For example, if you buy a piece of equipment for $100 and each year it has a 
depreciation of $25, then you’d report $25 of accumulated depreciation the first 
year and $50 of accumulated depreciation the next year, while PPE value would go 
from $100 the first year to $50 the next.
To calculate straight-line depreciation, all you do is start with the original pur-
chase price of the equipment, subtract the amount you think you can sell it for as 
scrap, and then divide that number by the total number of years that you estimate 
the equipment will be functional. The answer you get is the amount of deprecia-
tion you need to apply each year. So a piece of equipment bought for $110 that lasts 
four years and can be sold as scrap for $10 has a depreciation of $25 each year.
A similar type of depreciation, called unit-of-production depreciation, replaces years 
of usage with an estimated total number of units that the equipment can produce 
over its lifetime. You calculate the depreciation each year by using the number of 
units produced that year.
SUM OF YEARS DEPRECIATION
The sum of years method for calculating depreciation applies a greater value loss at 
the start of the equipment’s life and slowly decreases the value loss each year. 

CHAPTER 4  Staying Balanced      53
This method allows companies to take into account the marginally decreasing loss 
of value that most purchases go through.
To see what I mean, imagine that you’re buying a new car. Unless you get into an 
accident or otherwise damage the vehicle, the car itself will never lose as much 
value during its lifetime as it does in the first year. By the time the car is 10 years 
old, it will have lost most of its value, but it won’t be losing its value as quickly 
each year.
To calculate the depreciation each year by using the sum of years method, you 
divide the remaining number of years of life the equipment has left, n, by the sum 
of the integers 1 through n, and then multiply the answer by the cost of the equip-
ment minus salvage cost. Here’s what that looks like in equation form:
(

So if you purchase a piece of equipment for $100,000 and it’s supposed to last for 
five years with a salvage value of $10,000, then the first year’s depreciation would 
look like this:

The first year represents 5 15 of the total depreciation that the equipment will go 
through. The next year is 4 15 (in this case, $24,000), the next year is 3 15, and so on.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are things that add value to a company but that don’t actually 
exist in physical form. Intangible assets primarily include the legal rights to some 
idea, image, or form. Here are just a few examples:
»
» The big yellow M that McDonald’s uses as its logo is worth quite a bit because 
people recognize it worldwide. Imagine if McDonald’s simply gave that M, 
which it calls the “Golden Arches,” away to another restaurant. How much 
business would it attract?
»
» The curved style of the Coca-Cola bottles, as well as the font of the words 
Coca-Cola, are worth a lot of money because, like the Golden Arches, they’re 
easy to recognize across the globe.
»
» For pharmaceutical companies, owning the patent to some new form of 
medication can be worth quite a lot even if they’re not producing the medicine 
yet simply because the patent gives them the right to produce that medicine 
while simultaneously restricting other businesses from producing the same 
thing.

54      PART 2  Making a Statement
None of these examples can be physically touched, but they contribute to the value 
of the company and are certainly considered long-term assets.
Other assets
Any assets that a company hasn’t otherwise listed in the assets portion of the bal-
ance sheet go into an all-inclusive portion called other assets. The exact items 
included can vary quite a bit depending on the industry in which the company 
operates.
Learning about Liabilities
Liabilities include those accounts and debts that a company must pay back. Like 
assets, liabilities usually fall into two main categories:
»
» Current liabilities: Liabilities that must be paid back, fully or in part, in less 
than one year
»
» Long-term liabilities: Liabilities that must be paid back in a time period of 
one year or more
Current liabilities
This section lists the current liabilities you find on the balance sheet in order from 
those that must be paid in the shortest period from when they were incurred to 
those that can be paid off in the longest period from when they were incurred.
Accounts payables
Accounts payables include any money that’s owed for the purchase of goods or ser-
vices that the company intends to pay within a year. Say, for instance, that a 
company purchases $500 in paper clips and plans to pay that amount off in six 
months. The company adds $500 to the value of its accounts payables. But after 
the company pays an invoice for the money it owes, it removes the value of that 
invoice from the accounts payables.
Unearned income
When a company receives payment for a product or service but has yet to provide 
the goods or services it was paid for, the value of what the company owes the cus-
tomer contributes to its unearned income. Imagine, for example, that you own a 

CHAPTER 4  Staying Balanced      55
dog polishing business that charges $10 per session. One of your customers pays 
$120 for monthly sessions, so your unearned income for that customer is $120 at 
the start. That value decreases by $10 every month as you provide the services that 
the customer paid for in advance.
Accrued compensation and accrued expenses
As a company utilizes resources such as labor, utilities, and the like, it must even-
tually pay for these resources. However, most companies make such payments 
once every week, two weeks, three weeks, month, and so on, not upon receipt of 
the resource.
»
» Accrued compensation refers to the amount of money that employees have 
earned by working for the company but haven’t been paid yet. Not that the 
company is refusing to pay, necessarily, just that people tend to get paid once 
every one to four weeks. So until these people receive their paychecks, the 
amount that the company owes them is considered a liability.
»
» Accrued expenses work in a similar way and are applied to such things as rent, 
electricity, water, and any other expenses that a company incurs and pays at 
regular intervals.
Deferred income tax
For tax purposes, sometimes a company chooses to report its income in a different 
period than when it actually earned the income. Although deferred income tax, as 
it’s called, can be quite useful for businesses in their attempt to reduce tax 
expenses in any given year, it does provide an additional concern for analysts. To 
clarify just how much a company owes in deferred income taxes, the company 
reports this amount in the liabilities portion of the balance sheet.
Current portion of long-term debt
Often companies pay long-term debt in small portions over the course of several 
years. The current portion of long-term debt that a company has to pay in the next 
year is subtracted from long-term liabilities (see the next section) and added as a 
part of the short-term liabilities. Not all companies include this category on their 
balance sheets, but it’s extremely common.
Other current liabilities
Companies include any liabilities that they have to pay within the next year and 
that they don’t specify elsewhere on the balance sheet in the liability category 
creatively called other current liabilities. This category can include a wide variety of 
things from royalties to interest to rebates and everything in between.

56      PART 2  Making a Statement
Long-term liabilities
This section outlines the categories you see in the long-term liabilities section of 
the balance sheet.
Notes payable
When a company owes money that it expects to pay in a time period that’s longer 
than one year, the value of that money goes into a category called notes payable. 
Often this category includes all loans and debt that the company is expected to pay 
over the long run. However, some companies choose to include any payments on 
bonds held for more than one year in a separate category called bonds payable.
Capital lease obligations
When a company leases a piece of capital, the total amount owed on that lease 
adds to the value of the capital lease obligations category of liabilities. As the com-
pany gradually pays the lease, each payment causes a deduction from this 
liability.
Eyeing Owners’ Equity
The owners’ equity portion of the balance sheet breaks down exactly what value 
the company has to its owners and how that value is allocated to them. The 
amount of value that investors have in a corporation is equivalent to the amount 
of total assets the company has minus its total liabilities.
In all cases, regardless of any other variables, debtors always get their cut in a 
company’s assets before investors. Just as you must take into consideration all the 
money you owe when calculating your personal net worth, so must every com-
pany. Owners don’t get anything until lenders get their money back.
This section goes over the subsections that fall under the owners’ equity portion 
of the balance sheet. The first three cover different types of stock, while the last 
three go over other types of earnings and income.
Preferred shares
Company ownership is measured in shares of stock, but the types of stock vary. 
The first one listed on the balance sheet is called preferred shares. Preferred shares 
take precedence over all other types of stock in several different ways. First of all, 
preferred stockholders are guaranteed dividends, which means they always get 

CHAPTER 4  Staying Balanced      57
their payments before common shareholders get theirs (see the next section). If 
the preferred holders don’t get their guaranteed dividends one year, those divi-
dends accumulate into the next year. Holders of preferred shares also get their full 
value in the liquidation of the company should it go out of business before holders 
of common shares get anything. Some types of preferred shares can be converted 
into common shares.
On the balance sheet, stock is treated a little differently than on the income state-
ment because you need more details than just the type and amount of stock for the 
owners’ equity portion to be useful. In addition to the exact type of stock (in terms 
of preferred shares, standard preferred or convertible preferred), the balance sheet 
must also list the percentage dividends guaranteed on preferred stock, the number 
of shares authorized, and the par value guaranteed to preferred shares in case of 
liquidation (see the section “Additional paid-in capital” for details on par value).
Common shares
Like preferred shares, common shares give their holders the right to receive divi-
dends and obtain company information upon request, but unlike preferred shares, 
common shares also come with voting rights that can influence company policy. 
The balance sheet treats common shares similarly to how it treats preferred shares 
in that the common shares section must list the number of shares outstanding, 
the number of shares authorized, and their par value.
Treasury shares
Treasury shares are shares of common stock that the issuing company has repur-
chased (a common behavior when a company believes the share price of the stock 
will increase with decreased shares available to investors). Companies often hold 
on to treasury shares in an attempt to drive up their own share price with the goal 
of reselling the shares at a profit. Companies aren’t required to list as much infor-
mation about these shares on the balance sheet, but they do have to include total 
value of shares.
Additional paid-in capital
The par value of a stock is originally set by corporations with contributions by their 
investment bankers at the initial public offering (the first time a specific stock is 
sold to investors as a company raises money) — often just called the IPO. The 
investment bankers determine the value of the company, which is used to estab-
lish the amount to be raised, and then divide that amount by the total number of 
shares to get the par value. During the IPO, shares are sold at no less than the par 
value, but investors often pay more as they try to outbid other investors. Any 

58      PART 2  Making a Statement
amount that the company raises over par value contributes to the additional paid-
in capital and shows up on the balance sheet as such.
Retained earnings
When a company earns income, that is to say when it makes money, that money 
either goes to the owner(s) of the company or is reinvested in the company. In 
either case, the money belongs to the company’s owner(s) and must contribute to 
the value of their ownership in the company. For corporations, any money that 
doesn’t go to the stockholders in the form of dividends (which are reported on the 
income statement; see Chapter 5) is reinvested in the value of the company as 
retained earnings. Retained earnings consist of the money that a company makes 
after all expenses that it reinvests instead of giving to the stockholders.
Sometimes actions occur that impact the reported value of a company or some 
portion of the balance sheet. If these actions need more explanation to be fully 
understood, the company can include them in the supplemental notes portion of 
the balance sheet at the very bottom.
Finding Financial Zen
The information included in the balance sheet allows you to determine the very 
value of a company, as well as to whom that value is allocated as the company 
either thrives or fails in its pursuits. Everything that contributes to the value of a 
single corporation is either provided by the owners (the shareholders) or the 
lenders (who the corporation is obligated to repay). It is for this reason that those 
in corporate finance must work hard to find the appropriate balance between the 
two (discussed in more detail in Chapter 17).
By applying this information, you can determine a company’s ability to pay back 
loans, the value of the company’s stock, and the expected return for investors. 
Plus, you can use the values you get from these metrics to evaluate whether the 
company is worth any loans issued, how efficiently management is allocating 
resources, how efficient the company’s production is working, how effective a 
company is at managing inventory, how efficiently it sells its products, how effec-
tive it is at collecting debt, and so much more.
By itself, the balance sheet shows only metrics related to value. But when you use 
it with information from the income statement and the statement of cash flows, 
you can determine how effectively a company is using its assets to generate 
income, as well as how well a company may use income to pay its debts.

CHAPTER 5  Incoming Income      59
Chapter 5
Incoming Income
H
ow can you tell whether a company is successfully generating wealth 
beyond the wildest dreams of its owners, providing them with levels of 
luxury understood only through ancient mythology, or dooming them to a 
life of desperate poverty from which they may never escape, or something in 
between? By looking at the company’s income statement. Simply put, the income 
statement is a financial report that describes whether a company is thriving in its 
pursuit of income or flushing money down the toilet.
In this chapter, I break down the income statement in the order that it’s written, 
starting with the total amount of money made and then going through all the 
additional revenues and all the costs, until I end with a profit (or loss, if your 
company isn’t doing so well).
Adding It Up
Income statements come in two types: single-step and multiple-step. They’re 
essentially the same thing except that a multiple-step income statement provides 
more detail, so I focus on the multiple-step version in this chapter. For a rundown 
of single-step income statements, see the upcoming sidebar.
IN THIS CHAPTER

» Surveying the parts of the income 
statement
»
» Evaluating the income statement for 
quality of earnings

60      PART 2  Making a Statement
Corporate income statements work a lot like your personal finances: You start 
with the amount of money you make and then subtract all your costs to find out 
how much you have left to put in the bank, buy a new vacation home, or join a 
professional Ping-Pong team.
The main difference is that corporate income statements probably include more 
information overall than your personal income statement. In fact, a company’s 
income statement breaks down how much money it’s making versus how much 
it’s spending into six main categories. Together, these six categories detail the 
company’s costs and revenues, separating them by their source operations. I cover 
each of these categories in the following sections.
Gross profit
The first portion of the income statement, called gross profit, seeks to calculate the 
profitability of a company’s operations after direct costs. Its ultimate goal is to 
determine the company’s gross margin.
For example, if you’re a self-employed window washer, your margin is all the 
money you make for washing windows, minus the cost of the materials you used 
to wash those windows (for example, soap, water, and other supplies), but not the 
cost of your ladder because you use it over and over again.
Net sales
Net sales is all the money that a company makes from its primary operations. If the 
company is a retailer, then net sales includes all the money the company gener-
ates from selling retail goods. If the company is a lawn service but it also offers 
tree trimming, then net sales includes the money it makes from both services. 
SINGLE-STEP INCOME STATEMENTS
Many companies prefer to use single-step income statements, particularly for minor 
reports that aren’t annual or quarterly.
The big difference between the multiple-step income statement and the single-step 
income statement is that the single-step statement doesn’t separate costs and revenues 
by their source operations. Instead, it lists all income, breaking it down into net sales 
and other, and then lists all costs, with a total of the costs. Finally, it lists earnings before 
interest and taxes (EBIT), taxes, net income, and earnings per share (EPS). It’s a much 
shorter method of reporting earnings, but it isn’t nearly as informative as the multiple-
step statement.

CHAPTER 5  Incoming Income      61
However, it doesn’t include any money made from other activities outside of its 
core operation(s). So no counting the extra money made from selling an old 
lawnmower.
To get net sales, don’t subtract any costs yet. Net sales includes every last dime a 
company makes from sales; the costs come into play later.
Some companies refer to net sales as gross income, income from sales, or some other 
similar term. Just remember that net sales is always the very first item on the 
income statement, regardless of what a company calls it.
Cost of goods sold
To make a product or provide a service, a company has to purchase supplies. 
Maybe a tool manufacturer needs to buy steel. Maybe a window washing company 
needs to buy soap and water. Maybe a tutoring company just needs to pay its 
tutors. No matter what its primary operation is, every company adds up all the 
direct costs it incurs as a result of actually making its product or service, not 
including indirect costs (sales costs, administrative costs, research costs, and so 
on), and includes them under cost of goods sold (COGS) on the income statement. 
The very nature of this section lies within its name: It’s the cost a company has 
incurred in making or buying the goods that it has sold.
Just like the price of beer changes at the store from time to time, the costs of those 
things a company purchases can change. So when the things a company purchases 
change, it must choose how it will measure the cost of goods sold. The two pri-
mary ways a company can account for the costs of goods sold are
»
» FIFO (first-in, first-out): With this method, a company will use the costs of 
those things it purchased earliest when accounting for COGS. In other words, 
the first inventory made or bought is the first inventory to be sold.
»
» LIFO (last-in, first-out): With this method, a company will use the cost of 
those things it purchased most recently when accounting for COGS. In other 
words, the most recent inventory made or bought is the first inventory to be 
sold.
Because the value of inventory minus costs influences all other financial state-
ments, a company must choose to use either FIFO accounting or LIFO accounting 
and stick with it for everything. If a company chooses to switch from one method 
to another, it must describe the change, including the calculated change in value 
resulting from the change in method. It describes this change in the supplemen-
tary notes of at least the income statement and typically all the other financial 
statements, as well.

62      PART 2  Making a Statement
Gross margin
The last part of the gross profit portion of the income statement is the gross mar-
gin, which you get by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the net sales. The 
gross margin is all the money a company has left over from its primary operations 
to pay for overhead and indirect costs, like the sales staff, building rent, janitorial 
services, and everything else that’s not directly related to the production or pur-
chase of inventory.
When you divide gross margin by net sales, you get the percentage of net sales 
that isn’t spent on producing the inventory. This percentage is extremely impor-
tant in evaluating a company’s ability to fund supporting operations, plan growth, 
and create budgets. The gross margin, sometimes called just margin, also comes 
into play in a number of metrics that I describe in Chapters 7 and 8.
Operating income
The next portion of the income statement takes into account the rest of a com-
pany’s costs of doing business (other than the costs of goods sold) and is called 
operating income. Think of it as a way of breaking down the overhead costs associ-
ated with all the standard operations without including any infrequent revenues 
or costs. The overall goal of the operating income is to determine how much 
money a company is making after taking into consideration all the costs the com-
pany incurs during its primary and supporting operations. Here’s what goes into 
the operating income:
»
» Selling expense: This includes everything a company spent on selling the 
products it bought or made, such as advertising, sales wages or commissions, 
shipping, and the cost of retail outlets. The cost of opening a retail outlet may 
be a selling expense, or perhaps just the cost of a sales team may be a selling 
expense — anything at all related or attributed exclusively to the sales 
process, whether entirely or in part.
»
» General and administrative costs: Also called G&A costs, these cover all the 
expenses of running a company. The salaries of the finance, marketing, 
human resources, and management staff fall into this category, as do the 
salaries of everyone who isn’t directly associated with making or selling the 
inventory. Other costs that fall into this category include the costs of buildings, 
utilities, office supplies, insurance, office equipment, decorations, and a wide 
variety of other stuff. Any time a company spends money on an expense that 
keeps the company going but that isn’t related to production or sales, it goes 
into the G&A costs.

CHAPTER 5  Incoming Income      63
»
» Depreciation and amortization: The income statement includes a section 
for depreciation and amortization, but it doesn’t reveal anything about a 
physical transition of money from one party to another. Rather, this section 
simply recognizes the use of items that will lose value. The amount of 
depreciation listed on the income statement is the same as the amount 
incurred during a single period that gets added to the balance sheet.
The depreciation and amortization value on the income statement isn’t the same 
value that appears on the balance sheet because the balance sheet is cumulative 
while the income statement includes only depreciation incurred that year. But the 
amount of depreciation incurred in the year will go into the balance sheet’s cumu-
lative total.
To get the operating income, you just add up all the costs listed in the preceding three 
sections and then subtract that number from the gross margin. Because the operat-
ing income represents the amount of money a company has left over after it has paid 
for all its standard operations, companies need to consider it when planning whether 
to expand, whether to use equity or debt to fund expansion, and how much money 
they can borrow and safely pay back using their primary operations. Operating 
income is also useful in other metrics, such as liquidity, which I cover in Chapter 7.
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
Over the course of doing business, a company incurs costs or generates income 
from a number of activities that aren’t related to the company’s normal operations. 
The goal in this portion of the income statement is to account for all these other 
costs and revenues so the company can make smart financial decisions on debt and 
so it knows how much to pay in taxes. The final calculation in this portion is called 
earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and it includes the following elements:
»
» Other income: This includes anything the company does other than its main 
business that generates income. For example, a company that has an extra 
office in its building that it isn’t using can rent that office out to others, thereby 
generating other income. Similarly, a company can sell off a piece of old 
equipment to buy new equipment. The money it makes by selling the old 
equipment falls into the other income category.
»
» Other expenses: This includes anything the company does other than its 
main business that incurs costs. As with other income, other expenses can 
vary widely. If a company spends or loses money that doesn’t belong in any 
other category, it counts here. Taxes are one of the most common other 
expenses a company incurs. Companies can include any taxes they must pay, 
other than income taxes, in this portion. Income taxes go in the net income 
portion of the income statement (see the next section).

64      PART 2  Making a Statement
»
» Profit/loss for discontinued operations: Any time a company decides to 
stop pursuing one or more of its operations, the amount of profit or loss 
experienced from stopping, as well as the amount generated from running 
those operations up until that point, goes here. In other words, if a company 
is losing money on some operation and it decides to stop that operation 
halfway through the period, the amount of money the company lost up until 
that period is included here. In addition, any money the company received 
from selling the equipment for that operation or paying off lawsuits for the 
operation is included here.
You calculate EBIT by taking gross margin and then subtracting or adding the dif-
ferent sources of costs and revenues associated with nonprimary business opera-
tions. Essentially, earnings before interest and taxes is the total amount the 
company made before lenders and the government get their hands on the com-
pany’s profits. It’s an important value for companies and investors to consider 
because this income statement item shows how much money the company is 
making and how much it has to pay in taxes. For example, a company that’s mak-
ing less money this year than last year will pay less taxes. So, all in all, the earn-
ings before interest and taxes determine whether a company can make money the 
way it’s currently operating.
Net income
The final portion of the income statement that lists costs and revenues is called 
net income and deals exclusively with taxes and interest. A company has to pay the 
taxes and interest charges that appear in this section, but the amounts due are 
often related to the amount of money the company makes. As a result, the com-
pany has to account for all other expenses and revenues before it can calculate 
these final items and determine the company’s total profits. Here’s a breakdown 
of what goes into net income:
»
» Interest income: A company can earn interest when it has some types of 
bank accounts, when it owns bonds or other forms of debt on individuals or 
companies, or when it purchases money-market investments like certificates 
of deposit. All this interest falls under interest income on the income 
statement.
»
» Interest expense: A company can generate interest expense when it borrows 
money from a bank or other organization or when it issues bonds. All the 
interest that a company pays, regardless of where the interest expense comes 
from, goes into the interest expense portion of the income statement.

CHAPTER 5  Incoming Income      65
»
» Income tax expense: Like people, companies must pay taxes on the income 
they generate. The amount of income taxes a company pays is based on their 
EBT (earnings before tax, but not interest). So if a company makes $100 in a 
tax year and it has to pay 6 percent in income tax, then it has to pay $6. Many 
companies also list the percentage of income taxes in this section, but it isn’t 
required.
Net income is calculated by taking EBIT and subtracting all interest and tax 
expense. Simply put, the net income is the final amount that a company walks 
away with after it has considered all costs. It includes all revenues and all costs 
and represents the final profits that a company was able to generate during the 
period. The company must either distribute the money from net income to its 
stockholders (who own the company) or reinvest it into the company for improve-
ments and expansion. Either way, the money from net income belongs to the 
company owners and must contribute to the value of their ownership in the 
company.
Earnings per share
In the portion of the income statement immediately following net income, corpo-
rations have to include the amount of earnings each share of stock they have out-
standing has generated. Here are the two main components of this portion, aptly 
called earnings per share (EPS):
»
» Basic earnings per share: Companies calculate the basic earnings per share 
by dividing net earnings by the total number of common shares outstanding. 
This calculation tells investors how much money each share of stock they own 
earned during the period. For example, if a company made $1,000 during a 
year and has a total of 1,000 shares of stock, then everyone who owns that 
company’s stock made $1 per share of stock.
»
» Diluted earnings per share: Companies can issue a number of options that 
can eventually turn into common stock. For example, company employees 
may be given stock options, or preferred shares and convertible bonds may 
be converted into common stock. The diluted earnings per share does the 
same thing as basic earnings per share except that it assumes all these 
different holding options have been turned into common shares. So a 
company that made $1,000 and has 1,000 shares of stock has an earnings per 
share of $1. But if that company also has 1,000 shares of convertible pre-
ferred stock, its diluted earnings per share is $0.50.

66      PART 2  Making a Statement
Supplemental notes
Sometimes events that alter a company’s income occur but don’t have a place on 
the income statement or require additional comments. Anything of this sort goes 
in the supplemental notes portion of the income statement. Examples include the 
following:
»
» A switch from LIFO inventory cost accounting to FIFO inventory cost 
accounting
»
» An unusual or infrequent event, such as finding an oil reserve where your new 
building is being constructed and selling it for extra revenues
»
» Any discontinued operations or unusual earnings from subsidiaries
Putting the Income Statement to 
Good Use
By itself, the information you find in the income statement is great for tracking 
expenses and revenues, corporate revenue management, and dividend policy. But 
you can find out even more by comparing the same company’s income statements 
over a series of years. In fact, by watching for trends in a company’s income state-
ments, you can identify successes or problems with specific operations that gen-
erate costs relative to the amount that the operations contribute to generating 
revenues. And, of course, you can compare the income statement of one company 
to the income statements of other companies in the same industry to determine 
how competitive that company is within the industry as well as how it should 
position itself regarding price and volume of output.
When used in conjunction with other financial statements, the income statement 
contributes to a number of metrics that measure how effectively a company’s 
management manages its assets and how well the company yields returns on 
those assets. Investors can use these metrics to determine whether the company 
is generating income and wealth on their share of the ownership in the company 
and whether the company is holding excessive levels of debt that could endanger 
the value of their ownership sometime in the future. I discuss these different met-
rics in Chapters 7 and 8.

tions, making investments, issuing debt, and so on. Determining whether 
these activities that use a company’s money generate positive or nega-
tive value is crucial to understanding whether a company is using its money 
wisely.
In this chapter, I discuss the statement of cash flows, the financial record that 
tells all about the movement of cash into a company (inflows) and out of a com-
pany (outflows), and the reasons why these cash flows occur.
Moving Along Three Smooth Flows
Cash and cash equivalents hold a special place in the hearts of managers, inves-
tors, and lenders. Even the love stories of old are rarely able to portray the dedi-
cation and devotion that some people have for cash. No wonder companies write 
their own love poems about cash (and the way they use it) in the form of financial 
statements called statements of cash flows. Having assets and value is good, but it’s 
all meaningless unless you can turn it into cash, because cash is the universal 
medium to transfer all the value a corporation has generated. (See Chapter  1, 
which discusses the role of money as a medium of transferring value.)

to good use

68      PART 2  Making a Statement
In Chapter 4, I explain that the phrase cash and cash equivalents refers to any money 
that’s either currently in the possession of the company or can almost instantly be 
put in the company’s possession by way of withdrawals on bank accounts. Any 
transaction that appears in the balance sheet or income statement that influences 
cash must also appear in the statement of cash flows. Not all transactions alter a 
company’s cash flows, but every transaction that does must be part of this 
statement.
To create the statement of cash flows, companies divide cash flows into three sep-
arate categories based on the type of business activity that caused the transaction 
to take place: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. 
Each statement of cash flows starts with a section on operating activities that lists 
the transactions that increase cash, followed by the transactions that decrease 
cash flow. The end of each section lists the net cash flow as either positive or 
negative. For example, if a company made revenues from its primary operations, 
it would have a positive net cash flow in the first section of its statement of cash 
flows.
Together, the three sections of the statement of cash flows determine how a com-
pany’s different financial operations influence their total cash flows. Manage-
ment can then use this info to better manage its cash and identify any potential 
problems that could result from having a lack of cash. (Note: A company can have 
a lot of assets, but unless it can turn those assets into cash, it can still have cash 
flow and liquidity problems.)
Operating cash flows
Q: What do you call it when a company either earns or spends money in the form 
of cash by performing its primary operations?
A: Operating activities cash flows, of course!
In essence, operating activities cash flows include any increases or decreases in cash 
that result from the primary functions of the company. Here are some of the most 
common changes in cash you may see in the operating activities portion of the 
statement of cash flows:
»
» Cash received from customers: When a customer pays in cash (including via 
an electronic transfer made between accounts), you count that transaction as 
a cash increase in the operating activities cash flows. The ultimate purpose of 
any company that makes something is to eventually trade that something for 
money, and when that trade happens as a cash transaction, it qualifies as a 
cash flow.

CHAPTER 6  Going with the (Cash) Flow      69
»
» Cash paid to suppliers and employees: To make the products being sold to 
customers, companies have to pay their employees, as well as any other 
companies that provide supplies. The cash paid to employees and suppliers 
counts as cash flow, but it doesn’t include only cash paid for direct labor. It 
includes cash paid to everyone involved in keeping the company operating.
»
» Interest received: Savings accounts, some types of short-term ­money-­market 
investments, and a number of other types of accounts generate interest. This 
interest always comes in the form of cash, so the interest a company earns on 
these accounts and investments contributes to a positive net cash flow from 
operations. Note: This category doesn’t include interest generated from 
investments because investing isn’t part of the company’s primary operations 
(unless the company is a bank or some other financial type of company). 
Holding cash in an account, on the other hand, is a primary necessity of 
business operations, so the interest generated in that regard counts as an 
operational cash flow.
»
» Interest paid: A number of transactions related to operations influence a 
company’s cash balance. These may include interest financing for the 
purchase of equipment and inventory or some other short-term loan or 
repayment plan. As long as the loan or repayment plan is directly related to 
operations instead of financing growth and expansion, it contributes to the 
value of cash that must be subtracted from operating cash flow.
»
» Income taxes paid: Income taxes are considered a part of operations 
because they’re the taxes that result from selling goods at a profit. Companies 
have to subtract this number from the cash flows from operations.
The total amount of cash gained or lost by operations is the net cash provided by 
operations. To calculate it, add up the positive values from the preceding list of cash 
flows from operations and subtract the negative values. This number usually 
appears at the end of the operating activities portion of the statement of cash flows.
Investing cash flows
Whenever a company purchases or sells any form of investment, including large, 
long-term assets, the cash flows result in either a gain or loss in cash from the 
total cash and cash equivalents (although they could also break even). Any of these 
cash flow changes that result from the purchase or sale of investment assets 
belong in the investing activities cash flows portion of the statement of cash flows. 
Some of the most common transactions that show up in this section are
»
» Purchases of investments: When a company purchases an investment with 
cash, the price of that purchase decreases the amount of cash available to the 
company. No matter what type of investment (stock, bond, or something else) 
it is, the impact on cash influences the cash flows from investing activities.

70      PART 2  Making a Statement
»
» Proceeds from sale of investments: When a company sells the investments 
it already owns for cash or partially for cash, whatever cash increase the sale 
generates is considered proceeds from investing activities. Even if the 
company sells the investment at a net loss (the company paid more for the 
investment than what it sold for), overall, the sale still increases cash relative 
to the company’s cash levels before the sale because the company already 
accounted for the cash decrease when it purchased the investment. 
Remember that the statement of cash flows focuses only on cash levels, not 
company value.
»
» Purchase of property, plant, and equipment (PPE): The purchase of PPE 
refers to the times when a company purchases long-term assets, usually of a 
large and/or expensive nature. Because companies often make PPE pur-
chases on credit, the impact on cash usually happens a little at a time over 
several periods. Say, for example, a company purchases a $100,000 piece of 
equipment and plans to pay it off over the course of ten years (with no 
interest). The annual impact on cash flows is a $10,000 annual reduction as 
the company makes its payments.
»
» Proceeds from sale of PPE: Companies can usually sell any used machinery 
and equipment they don’t need anymore (at least for scrap if not whole), and 
they can even sell land and buildings at a profit as property values increase. 
The proceeds companies make from these types of sales go into the investing 
activities cash flows.
Add up all the positive values from the investing activities portion of the statement 
of cash flows and then subtract the negative values. The final answer is the total 
amount of change in cash the company has had as a result of its investing activi-
ties (called the net cash provided by investing activities). This number usually appears 
at the end of the investing activities portion of the statement of cash flows.
Financing cash flows
Financing refers to the process of acquiring capital to fund a startup, an expansion, 
basic operations, or whatever else the company needs the extra funds for. Most of 
the time, changes in liabilities (the debt a company uses to fund asset purchases) 
and owners’ equity (the ownership purchases whose proceeds are used to fund 
asset purchases) impact cash, regardless of whether the company is acquiring or 
repaying the cash. Thus, the following types of financing activities show up in the 
statement of cash flows (yep, you guessed it — in the financing activities portion):
»
» Sale of securities: When a company sells another company’s securities, that 
sale is considered an investing activity. When a company sells its own stock, 
the sale is considered a financing activity. The difference is that a company 

CHAPTER 6  Going with the (Cash) Flow      71
purchases another company’s stock with the hopes that it will increase in 
value, while a company sells its own stock to generate income meant to 
finance the purchase of assets. So, when a company sells its own securities, it 
contributes to a positive balance of cash in the financing activities.
»
» Dividend payments: A company that makes money instead of losing it must 
give the money it makes back to its stockholders either as a reinvestment in 
the company through retained earnings or directly as cash through dividends. 
Whenever a company pays out dividends, the amount of cash the company 
has available decreases by the total amount of dividends paid.
»
» Purchase of treasury shares: Treasury shares are those shares in the 
possession of the company that the shares represent. In other words, a 
company purchases shares of its own stock, and those shares become 
treasury shares. If the company uses cash to purchase these shares, the total 
amount of cash the company has decreases as a result of financing 
operations.
»
» Loans received: Companies often accept loans as a way of financing opera-
tions or expansion. In some cases, they receive the loan in the form of cash, 
which increases the total amount of cash they have available. Accepting a cash 
loan, then, translates as an increase in cash from financing activities.
»
» Loans collected: Companies must also pay back the loans they accept, an 
action they typically do by using cash (banks don’t often accept livestock these 
days). So when a company gives cash to someone to repay a loan, that cash 
no longer belongs to the company and the company must deduct the amount 
from the cash flows from financing activities.
When you add up the positive values of the preceding bullets and subtract the 
negative ones, you get the net cash provided by financing activities. This value shows 
up at the end of the financing activities portion of the statement of cash flows. As 
with the other sections, a positive balance here means the financing operations 
are positively contributing to cash, while a negative balance means they are 
reducing the total amount of cash available.
Combining the three types of operations to 
get the net change in cash
Add up all the net cash provided by the three types of company operations (see the 
preceding three sections), and you get the total amount of change to the compa-
ny’s cash and cash equivalents. A positive net change means the company has 
increased the total amount of cash; a negative net change means the company has 
decreased its total amount of cash. In either case, that change appears on the bal-
ance sheet under the cash and cash equivalents label in the assets portion.

72      PART 2  Making a Statement
A reduction in cash isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as long as the operations are 
positively contributing to the company’s overall value. If a company is experienc-
ing negative cash flows consistently, however, that company’s management has 
to be careful to ensure they carefully manage the company’s cash and other assets 
so they can continue to pay their bills.
Reaching Your Destination
The statement of cash flows is a big deal for lenders who are considering whether 
to give loans to a company. Even if a company is making money, lenders want to 
make sure the company will have the cash available to make payments on their 
loans. So, lenders commonly use the statement of cash flows to assess a compa-
ny’s financial health, particularly its ability to maintain consistent positive cash 
flows to the degree required to pay off any potential new loans.
Lenders, managers, and investors frequently use data from the statement of cash 
flows in metrics to do the following:
»
» Measure a company’s liquidity (the ability of the company to pay its debts 
and bills)
RECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS AND 
ASSETS TO CASH BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES
The reconciliation of net earnings and assets to cash by operating activities section of the 
statement of cash flows doesn’t actually include any cash flows other than the ones I list 
in the section “Moving Along Three Smooth Flows,” but it still comes in handy when 
you’re evaluating a company’s cash flows. After all, it provides supplemental information 
from the income statement and balance sheet to show where the cash flows from oper-
ating activities are coming from.
The first part of this section lists those items from the income statement that alter cash 
flows from operating activities, including net income, deferred taxes, and so forth. Note 
that this section doesn’t include any individual items that influence net income because 
they’re already inherent as a part of net income. The second part of this section includes 
changes in the balance sheet that account for cash flows from operating activities in a 
similar manner. Together, the total of the values from the income statement and the 
balance sheet should total the net cash provided by operating activities (see the section 
“Operating cash flows” for details).

sources of cash flows for the use of financial efficiency and asset utilization

Mastering Metrics
T
his chapter and the next are among the most useful chapters in the book. 
It’s one thing to be able to understand what financial statements are for and 
how to read them. It’s another thing entirely to be able to pull specific ele-
ments from them and create useful ratios that help clarify what’s going on inside 
a corporation. These two chapters contain helpful lists of the most common 
financial metrics, with details on how to calculate them, and short descriptions on 
what they mean. Enjoy.
As with financial statements, the metrics in this chapter are most useful when you 
compare companies in the same industry. It’s also very helpful to compare past 
results to current results in a single company or compare trends over time between 
competing companies.
Paying the Bills
Liquidity metrics measure a company’s ability to pay its bills. Companies use the 
equations in this category to measure their ability to pay for the costs of doing 
business with the assets they currently have available to them. Just as a person 
who writes a bad check to pay their water bill shouldn’t expect to use the toilet for

much longer, a company that can’t pay its bills will have to stop output in the near 
future. This scenario doesn’t necessarily mean that the company is losing money; 
it just means the company has bills due before the money it has earned has been 
received.
By contrast, this category of ratios may indicate whether a company is holding on 
to too much cash, illustrating that the company isn’t utilizing the cash effectively 
to generate value.
When I discuss the variation of the values calculated in these metrics, I say things 
like “as the value increases” or “as the value goes high.” These calculations don’t 
have “perfect” or “correct” values. They can vary dramatically depending on the 
industry in which a corporation operates, or on the current macroeconomic con-
ditions. So, terms like “too high” or “too low” are variable. They are best under-
stood in the context of the industry and based on what the competitors are 
doing. . . at least until you know the corporation’s detailed financial needs.
Days sales in receivables
When a company sells a product and the person who bought it doesn’t pay right 
away, the money that the company will collect in the future is called a receivable. 
To calculate the number of days it takes for a company to finish collecting the 
money a customer owes it, the company can use the days sales in receivables metric, 
which looks like this:
Accounts receivables
Net sales
Days sales in receivable
365
s
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find gross receivables in the asset section of the balance sheet and net 
sales near the top of the income statement.
2.	 Divide net sales by 365 (the number of days in the year).
The number you get is the average amount of income after costs that the 
company is making per day in a given year.
3.	 Divide the gross receivables by the answer in Step 2 to get the number of 
days on average it took the company to collect a single receivable.
Because the company knows how many sales it made during a year and what per-
centage of those sales were receivables meant to be collected in the future, it can 
determine the average receivables per year. As the value of this ratio goes up, the 
company is taking longer to collect its money. If the value goes down, the com-
pany is collecting its money faster.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      77
If this ratio is too low, it may indicate that the company could increase sales by 
extending credit to potential customers who currently don’t have the cash to pur-
chase all at once. If this ratio is too high, it could indicate that the company could 
be generating more value if it more aggressively collected what it is owed and then 
utilized that money.
Although any sale made on credit becomes a receivable, companies usually collect 
money for inexpensive products very quickly. Thus, this particular metric is meant 
more for companies that sell very expensive products that require multiple pay-
ments, like machinery or vehicles. These companies like to plan ahead so they 
don’t spend too much money-making inventory before they collect on their exist-
ing sales.
Accounts receivables turnover
Companies like to know that they’re collecting the money that customers owe 
them. To find out exactly how well a company is at making sales that will be col-
lected in the future and how well the company is at collecting the money that 
people owe it, the company can use the accounts receivables turnover metric, which 
it calculates like this:
Net credit sales
Average accounts receivables
Accounts receiivables turnover
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find net credit sales on the income statement.
2.	 Use the balance sheets of the current year and the previous year to 
calculate the average gross receivables: Add the accounts receivables 
from both years and divide that number by 2.
3.	 Divide net sales by the answer in Step 2 to get the accounts receivables 
turnover.
If this ratio is too high, it could indicate that the company is ineffective at collect-
ing what is owed to it or that it has uncollectables reported as assets. If this ratio 
is too low, it may indicate that the company could increase sales by extending 
credit to potential customers that currently do not have the cash to purchase all at 
once.
This metric is called a turnover because it measures the number of times the aver-
age value of a company’s accounts receivables turns over — in other words, the 
number of times the accounts receivables are collected as sales and start fresh 
with brand new receivables. Of course, the company is still acquiring receivables, 

78      PART 2  Making a Statement
so the receivables account is never depleted; however, the average value can still 
be collected as sales. If the number is very low, the company may be having a dif-
ficult time collecting the money it’s owed.
Accounts receivables turnover in days
As a company collects the money it’s owed, the total amount the company is owed 
on average goes up or down depending on how quickly it collects its money. As a 
result, companies like to know how many days it takes them to collect an amount 
equivalent to the average total amount they’re owed. They can calculate this num-
ber by using accounts receivables turnover in days, which looks like this:
Average accounts receivables
Net credit sales
Accounts 
365
receivables turnover in days
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Use the balance sheets of the current year and the previous year to 
calculate the average gross receivables: Add the accounts receivables 
from both years and divide that number by 2.
2.	 Find net sales near the bottom of the income statement for the current 
year.
3.	 Divide net sales by 365.
The answer you get is the average number of sales the company is making per 
day in the current year.
4.	 Divide the answer in Step 1 by the answer in Step 3 to get the number of 
days it takes to collect as sales a total value that is equivalent to the 
average amount of money the company is owed as receivables.
Whether too low or too high, this ratio indicates much the same thing as the other 
receivables ratios. This one is unique in that it gives an average count of days, 
which is useful for planning purposes.
Days sales in inventory
How long does it take for a company to turn its inventory into sales? You can 
answer this question by using the metric known as days sales in inventory:
Ending inventory
Cost of goods sold
Days sales in inven
365
tory

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      79
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find the ending inventory on the balance sheet at the end of the year 
(the value of the inventory listed at the end of the year is the ending 
inventory) and the cost of goods sold (COGS) in the revenue portion of the 
income statement (usually somewhere near the top).
2.	 Divide the cost of goods sold by 365.
Because cost of goods sold includes the costs of making a product without all 
the additional business costs (for example, it includes the materials to make 
the product but not the cost of janitorial), dividing this number by 365 tells you 
how much money a company is spending on average per day to make a 
product.
3.	 Divide the value of the ending inventory by the answer in Step 2 to 
determine how many days it takes a company to sell the total value of its 
inventory.
Of course, the company continues to make more inventory, but measuring the 
inventory at the end of the previous year gives you the number of sales you’re 
comparing the days sales in inventory to. A lower number means the company is 
selling its inventory faster, while a higher number means the company takes lon-
ger to sell its inventory. If this becomes too high, it may indicate that the company 
is producing too much and can’t sell it off. If this number is too low, it may mean 
that it is time to invest in expanded production (or increase prices).
Inventory turnover
The number of times a company’s inventory is sold and replenished is called the 
inventory turnover. Here, the term turnover means that the total value of a compa-
ny’s inventory has been completely depleted and recovered. A high number means 
that the company cycles through its inventory very quickly. You calculate this 
magical value by using the following equation:
Cost of goods sold
Average inventory
Inventory turnover
Follow these steps to use this metric:
1.	 Find the cost of goods sold in the revenue portion of the income 
statement.
2.	 Use the balance sheets from the current year and the previous year to 
find average inventory: Add the two inventory values (find them in the 
assets section) and divide the total by 2.

80      PART 2  Making a Statement
3.	 Divide the cost of goods sold by the answer in Step 2 to get the inventory 
turnover.
A very high ratio here may indicate difficulty keeping up with demand. A very low 
ratio may indicate difficulty selling existing inventory.
Inventory turnover in days
When a company makes a lot of a single product, it wants to have an idea of how 
long it will take to sell it all. Knowing this can help the company estimate how 
quickly it will make money to pay off its bills and how much money it should spend 
on making more inventory, so it doesn’t have too much inventory or, even worse, 
run out altogether. Believe it or not, selling something you don’t have is quite dif-
ficult, as is buying more supplies if you can’t sell what you’ve already made. To 
avoid both of these mistakes, companies use the inventory turnover in days metric:
Average inventory
Cost of goods sold
Inventory turnover
365
 in days
Here’s how to use this equation:
1.	 Use the balance sheets from the current year and the previous year to 
find average inventory: Add the two inventory values (find them in the 
assets section) and divide the total by 2.
2.	 Find the cost of goods sold in the revenue section of the income 
statement.
3.	 Divide the cost of goods sold by 365.
4.	 Divide the answer in Step 1 by the answer in Step 3 to get the inventory 
turnover in days.
Unusually high metrics here may indicate too much inventory, which can be an 
expensive problem, because unsold inventories are expensive to store. Generally, 
companies should keep this number as low as possible, by using just-in-time 
(JIT) inventory management.
Operating cycle
The operating cycle is a big deal, so try to remember this one in particular. Have 
you ever walked into your favorite store and wondered how long it takes the com-
pany to do everything from start to finish? From purchasing supplies needed to 
make a product, to the time it takes to sell that same product? No, like a sane 
person, you probably haven’t considered this, but the store’s management and 
investors certainly have.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      81
The period of time from the moment a company purchases its inventory to the 
moment the final payment on the sale of that inventory is made is called the oper-
ating cycle. You figure out a company’s operating cycle by using this equation:
Accounts receivables turnover in days + Inventory turnover in days =  
Operating cycle
Both of the numbers that go into this equation come from metrics that I discuss 
earlier in this chapter. So, unfortunately, you need to do some preliminary calcu-
lations before you can figure out a company’s operating cycle. Trust me, it’s worth 
the extra work. After all, the end result is a number that tells you how well a com-
pany is managing its assets by calculating how long it takes the company to make 
money from start to finish. As with many of the other metrics in this chapter, you 
have to compare this value to other companies in the industry and against itself 
for it to be really useful. Aircraft carriers have longer operating cycles than bub-
blegum manufacturers, for instance. That means that corporations with longer 
operating cycles will tend to have higher liquidity needs.
If the operating cycle is unusually high, it may indicate some bottleneck in pro-
duction or another issue that is slowing operations.
Working capital
If you paid off all your short-term debts, what would the value of your remaining 
short-term assets be? For example, if you paid off your credit cards, would you 
have any money left in your bank account? Companies care about this, too, and to 
measure it, they use the working capital metric, which tells them exactly what their 
net value is in the short run. Here’s what this metric looks like:
Current assets – Current liabilities = Working capital
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find current assets and current liabilities on the balance sheet in the 
assets and liabilities sections (go figure!).
2.	 Subtract current liabilities from current assets to get the working capital.
If a company has more short-term assets than short-term liabilities, the com-
pany’s working capital is a positive number. Companies like to see positive work-
ing capital because it indicates that they can pay off their debts for at least the 
next year or so. Negative working capital is a very dangerous position to maintain.

82      PART 2  Making a Statement
Current ratio
Another way to look at a company’s liquidity for the next 12 months is by using 
the current ratio. This ratio calculates the number of times a company could pay off 
its current liabilities, using its current assets. Here’s what the ratio looks like:
Current assets
Current liabilities
Current ratio
And here’s how to use it:
1.	 Find current assets and current liabilities on the balance sheet.
2.	 Divide current assets by current liabilities to get the current ratio.
So, if a company had twice as many current assets as it had current liabilities, it 
has a current ratio equal to 2.0. If a company had half as many current assets as it 
had current liabilities, then its current ratio is 0.5. Because the current ratio 
includes inventories in addition to other forms of current assets, a low current 
ratio can indicate that a company is either at risk or very good at managing a low 
inventory (which is good for keeping costs down). In other words, you have to 
have some context to make this ratio really useful.
Acid test ratio (aka Quick Ratio)
Some companies that sell very large or expensive items have a difficult time sell-
ing inventories. To see whether these companies can pay off their debts due within 
the next year, you can use a metric called the acid test ratio. The acid test ratio uses 
all current assets except inventories and divides their value by the current liabili-
ties, as you can see in the equation that follows:
Cash equivalents
Marketable securities
Accounts receivables
Current liabilities
Acid test ratio
Follow these steps to put this equation to work:
1.	 Find the cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receiv-
ables in the assets portion of the balance sheet and the current liabilities 
in the liabilities portion.
2.	 Add together the company’s cash equivalents, marketable securities, and 
accounts receivables.
3.	 Divide the answer in Step 2 by the value of the current liabilities to get 
the acid test ratio.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      83
This ratio shows how many times a company could pay off the debt that’s due 
within the next 12 months using current assets other than inventory. Because this 
value doesn’t include inventories, it’ll be smaller than the current ratio, but it’s 
still important to consider because it shows whether a company has enough cash 
and other assets to quickly turn into cash to pay off debts owed and avoid bank-
ruptcy. Even so, a low acid test ratio may mean the company is at risk, or it may 
mean that the company is very effective at managing its accounts receivables by 
collecting them very quickly. The moral of the story: Be sure to interpret this ratio 
in the context of the company’s receivables management.
Cash ratio
The strictest test of a company’s liquidity is the cash ratio. This metric utilizes only 
the most liquid of assets — cash equivalents and marketable securities — to deter-
mine how many times a company could pay off its liabilities over the next 12 months. 
For companies that have very high accounts receivables, either because they sell 
expensive items that customers make long-term payments on or because they issue 
a lot of bad debt, this is often the best ratio to use. Here’s how to calculate it:
Cash equivalents
Marketable securities
Current liabilities
Cash ratio
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find the cash equivalents and marketable securities in the assets portion 
of the balance sheet and the current liabilities in the liabilities portion.
2.	 Add together cash equivalents and marketable securities.
3.	 Divide the answer in Step 2 by current liabilities.
This is the equivalent of feeling comfortable paying your bills using the money 
you currently have in your bank account. It’s a good feeling to know that you don’t 
have to worry about selling anything or relying on expected future income to pay 
the bills. However, having a ton of cash in the bank also means you’re not invest-
ing it very effectively.
Sales to working capital
The appropriate level of liquidity varies depending on the individual company in 
question, but you can use the sales to working capital ratio metric to help determine 
whether a company has too many or too few current assets compared to its cur-
rent liabilities. This metric looks like this:
Sales
Working capital
Sales to working capital

84      PART 2  Making a Statement
Here’s how to use this equation:
1.	 Find sales at the top of the income statement.
2.	 Calculate working capital by subtracting current liabilities from current 
assets (both of which you find on the balance sheet).
3.	 Divide the value of the company’s sales by its working capital to get the 
sales to working capital.
A very high number may indicate that a company doesn’t keep enough current 
assets available to maintain inventory levels for the number of sales it’s making. 
A very low number may mean that the company is keeping such a high proportion 
of its assets current that it isn’t using its assets to generate sales. Watching how a 
company’s sales to working capital varies over time compared to that of its com-
petitors can help give context to the other liquidity metrics by measuring how 
effectively the company is managing its working capital.
Operating cash flows to current maturities
The ratio of operating cash flows to current maturities utilizes the cash flows a com-
pany generates from its operations to determine its ability to pay any debts that 
are maturing within the next year. This ratio is different from the other liquidity 
metrics in this section in two important ways:
»
» It determines whether a company can pay debts by using the cash flows it 
generates rather than the assets it has on hand.
»
» It measures the company’s ability to pay off any liabilities that are going to be 
due within the next 12 months rather than just current liabilities.
In a way, this ratio determines a company’s ability to keep its cash flows liquid 
rather than its assets. You measure it like this:
Operating cash flows
Current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable
Operating cash flows to current maturities
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows and long-term 
debt and notes payable in the liabilities portion of the balance sheet.
2.	 Add together the long-term debts and notes payables that are going to 
mature in the next 12 months.
3.	 Divide operating cash flows by the answer in Step 2 to get operating cash 
flows to current maturities.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      85
As with the other liquidity metrics, the goal of this calculation is to determine 
whether a company can pay off the debts that are due within a year. A higher ratio 
indicates that the company is at low risk of defaulting on its debts, while a low 
ratio may mean that the company is at risk of defaulting. Operating cash flows 
aren’t as dependent on asset management as either receivables or inventories, so 
this metric can be more dependable, particularly for those investors who are con-
sidering providing the company a loan or purchasing its bonds.
Working Your Assets
The primary purpose of a company is to generate profits. Of course, companies 
can’t just charge any price they want and make tons of profits. If a company 
charges too much, customers will go to the competition, so every company is lim-
ited in its profitability. The following metrics are all ways to measure how well a 
company generates profits, as well as how effectively it is at managing them.
Net profit margin
The most common measure of a company’s profitability is the net profit margin. 
This metric measures the percentage difference between net income and net sales. 
In other words, it measures the percentage of a company’s sales revenues that 
don’t go toward business costs. You measure profit margin like this:
Net income
Net sales
Net profit margin
100
Here’s how to use this equation:
1.	 Find net income near the bottom and net sales near the top of the 
income statement.
2.	 Multiply net income by 100.
You use the number 100 here to form an answer that’s a percentage rather 
than a decimal number.
3.	 Divide the answer in Step 2 by net sales to get the net profit margin as a 
percentage.
The net profit margin tells you what percentage of the total money made by a 
company increases the value of the company or its owners rather than being spent 
on costs. However, a low profit margin doesn’t necessarily mean low profits. A 
company with a 1 percent profit margin makes less money on every sale than a 

86      PART 2  Making a Statement
company with a 2 percent profit margin, but the company with a 1 percent profit 
margin may make up the difference with a greater volume of sales.
Note: Some authorities say to divide net income by net sales and then multiply the 
answer by 100. Don’t worry, my preceding equation gives you the same answer. 
Test it for yourself or go ask your math teacher.
Total asset turnover
A company may have a lot of assets, but just how effective is it at using those 
assets to generate sales? To find out, you use a ratio called total asset turnover, 
which you calculate like this:
Net sales
Average total assets
Total asset turnover
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find net sales at the top of the income statement.
2.	 Use the balance sheets from the current year and the previous year to 
find the average total assets: Add together the total assets of the current 
year and the total assets of the previous year, and then divide that value 
by 2.
3.	 Divide net sales by average total assets to get the total asset turnover.
Assets that don’t generate sales simply cost money. The simplest example here is 
inventory: If a company has assets in the form of inventory that isn’t being sold, 
then it’s paying for the storage of that inventory without actually generating sales 
on it. The total asset turnover metric helps indicate how well a company manages 
its assets.
Return on assets
A company may have a lot of assets, but how effective is that company at using its 
assets to generate income? To find out, use a ratio called return on assets, which you 
calculate like this:
Net income
Average total assets
Return on assets

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      87
Use this equation by following these steps:
1.	 Find net income near the bottom of the income statement.
2.	 Use the balance sheets from the current year and the previous year to 
find the average total assets: Add together the total assets of the current 
year and the total assets of the previous year, and then divide that value 
by 2.
3.	 Divide net income by average total assets to get the return on assets.
The primary difference between return on assets and total asset turnover is that 
return on assets measures a company’s ability to turn assets into income rather 
than just sales. In other words, return on assets helps determine whether a com-
pany can use its assets to develop profitability, not just a volume of sales.
Operating income margin
The operating income margin measures the percentage difference between operat-
ing income and net sales. This metric differs from net profit margin in that it 
concerns itself only with income from operations, excluding a number of costs 
and revenues that go into measuring net income. You measure operating income 
margin with this equation:
Operating income
Net sales
Operating income margin
To use this metric, follow these steps:
1.	 Find net sales near the top of the income statement.
2.	 Find the operating income on the income statement if it’s listed; if it isn’t, 
calculate it by subtracting operating expenses and devaluation from the 
company’s gross income.
3.	 Divide the operating income by net sales to get the operating income 
margin.
You may prefer to measure operating income margin rather than net income mar-
gin because it’s more strictly reflective of how profitable a company’s operations 
are and how competitive a company is in its primary purpose.

88      PART 2  Making a Statement
Operating asset turnover
How effectively is a company using its operating assets to generate sales? To find 
out, use a ratio called operating asset turnover, which you calculate like this:
Net sales
Average operating assets
Operating asset turnover
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find net sales at the top of the income statement.
2.	 Find average operating assets by using the balance sheets from the 
current year and the previous year: Add together the operating assets of 
the current year and the operating assets of the previous year and divide 
that value by 2.
3.	 Divide net sales by average operating assets to get the operating asset 
turnover.
This metric determines how well a company is using those assets used specifi-
cally in the company’s primary operations to generate sales. Operating asset 
turnover is different from total asset turnover in that it doesn’t take into consid-
eration all assets and it may be more reflective of the company’s competitiveness 
in its primary operations.
Return on operating assets
How effectively does a company use its operating assets to generate income? Use 
the return on operating assets to find out:
Operating income
Average operating assets
Return on operatinng assets
To use this metric, work through these steps:
1.	 Use the income statement to find the operating income: Subtract 
operating expenses and devaluation from the company’s gross income.
2.	 Use both the current year’s balance sheet and the previous year’s 
balance sheet to find the average operating assets: Add together the 
operating assets of the current year and the previous year and divide 
that value by 2.
3.	 Divide operating income by average operating assets to get the return on 
operating assets.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      89
The primary difference between return on operating assets and operating asset 
turnover is that return on operating assets measures a company’s ability to turn 
operating assets into income rather than just sales. In other words, return on 
operating assets determines whether a company is using its operating assets to 
develop profitability rather than just a volume of sales. Like other measures of 
operating assets, this one differs from return on assets in that it focuses on the 
company’s core operations instead of giving an overall picture.
Return on total equity
Imagine that you own equity in a company. You’d probably want to know how 
much value the company is making for you, the stockholder. The good news is you 
can calculate the amount of income a company can generate with the equity you 
have invested in it by using the return on total equity metric, which looks like this:
Net income after tax
Average total equity
Return on total equity
To put this equation to work for you, follow these steps:
1.	 Find net income after tax near the bottom of the income statement.
2.	 Find the average total equity by using the balance sheets from the 
current year and the previous year: Add the total equity from the current 
year and the previous year, and then divide the sum by 2.
3.	 Divide the current year’s net income after tax by the average total equity 
to find the return on total equity.
Regardless of whether a company has only common shares or also has preferred 
shares, this ratio takes all equity into account. So, if you’re a preferred share-
holder, this is the return on equity you want to be concerned about.
Return on common equity
Return on common shares determines how much income a company can generate 
based only on the value of its common stock, discounting all other forms of equity. 
If a company issues only common stock and no other types, this metric will pro-
duce exactly the same number as return on total equity. Here’s what return on 
common equity looks like:
Net income after tax
Average common equity
Return on common equity

90      PART 2  Making a Statement
To use this metric, follow these steps:
1.	 Find net income after tax near the bottom of the income statement.
2.	 Find average common equity by using the balance sheets from the 
current year and the previous year: Add the common equities from the 
current year and the previous year, and then divide the sum by 2.
3.	 Divide the current year’s net income after tax by the average common 
equity to find the return on common equity.
Return on common shares is an important ratio for any stockholder to know 
because it shows how well a company is performing in regard to the interests of 
those who hold equity.
DuPont equation
In the 1920s, someone at the DuPont Corporation decided to take a closer look at 
return on equity by breaking it into its component pieces. Using the DuPont 
method, return on equity looks like this:
Profit margin × Asset turnover × Equity multiplier = DuPont equation  
(or return on equity)
The equity multiplier is a debt management ratio that I discuss in Chapter 8. You 
don’t have to be familiar with it to understand how the DuPont equation works or 
how you can use it, but you can flip to the section “Equity multiplier” in Chapter 8 
for more details.
If you break down the components in the preceding equation into their respective 
ratios, the DuPont equation looks like this:
Net income
Net sales
Net sales
Assets
Assets
Equity
DuPont equation (expanded)
Because net sales appear on top in profit margin and on the bottom in asset turn-
over, you can cancel it out. The same goes for assets, which you find in both asset 
turnover and equity multiplier. That leaves you with only net income and equity:
Net income
Equity
DuPont equation (simplified)
Notice that this simplified version of the DuPont equation is the same as the for-
mula for return on equity (see the section “Return on total equity” for details). 
Why not just use the basic return on equity equation? The full analysis, as you see 
it in the expanded DuPont equation, provides a full explanation of the factors that 

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      91
influence return on equity to determine exactly how a company could improve its 
profitability in this respect. A decrease in net sales, for example, increases profit 
margin but makes asset management less efficient. If the company can reduce the 
amount of assets on hand without harming the business, though, the profit mar-
gin will increase and the asset efficiency will improve, increasing the value of the 
company’s equity. Hence, using the DuPont equation can help a company to better 
manage its profitability.
Fixed asset turnover
A significant determinant of a company’s profitability is how well it manages 
fixed assets, such as production plants, properties, equipment, and other assets 
that contribute to the company’s potential output volume. A bigger plant may be 
able to handle greater production volume, but unless the company is able to turn 
that potential into actual sales, it’s just a wasted expense. That’s where fixed asset 
turnover comes into play. Here’s what this metric looks like:
Net sales
Average net fixed assets
Fixed asset turnover
To put this metric to use, follow these steps:
1.	 Find net sales at the top of the income statement.
2.	 Find average net fixed assets by using the balance sheets of the current 
year and the previous year: Add the net fixed assets of the current year 
and previous year together, and then divide the sum by 2.
3.	 Divide net sales by the answer in Step 2 to find the fixed asset turnover.
The fixed asset turnover tells companies how well they use their fixed assets to 
create sales. Trends in this ratio are a critical element when companies are decid-
ing whether or not to expand their production volume. A high fixed asset turnover 
means that a company is efficiently using its fixed assets. If a company’s fixed 
assets are already producing at capacity and it has a high fixed asset turnover, 
then it may be able to expand by investing in more fixed assets to generate addi-
tional sales. A low fixed asset turnover may indicate that the company has invested 
in too many fixed assets and should either increase sales or sell off those assets in 
order to reduce costs.
Return on investment
When a company raises funds, either by incurring debt or by selling equity, it 
invests those funds in purchasing the things necessary to make the company 
operate. The return on investment (ROI) is an extremely common measure that 

92      PART 2  Making a Statement
determines how well a company is using those investments to generate profits. In 
other words, ROI determines whether it was worth the company’s time and efforts 
to raise those funds in the first place. Use this equation to calculate ROI:
Net income
Average long-term liabilities
Average equity
Retuurn on investment
To put this equation to work for you, follow these steps:
1.	 Find net income near the bottom of the income statement.
2.	 Use the balance sheets of the current year and the previous year to 
calculate average long-term liabilities and average equity: Add up the 
long-term liabilities and the total equity from the current year and the 
previous year and divide the total sum by 2 to get the total average 
long-term liabilities plus average equity.
3.	 Divide the current year’s net income by the answer in Step 2 to get ROI.
Make sure that net income has already considered interest expense, or else you’ll 
end up with an artificially high return because interest expense is a cost of capital 
that doesn’t add value to the company. Hypothetically, ROI is always better when 
it’s higher, but that depends on the company’s pricing strategy and whether gen-
erating higher ROI is even possible.
Gross profit margin
After a company figures out how much it costs to cover the direct costs associated 
with the making and selling of a product, it has to figure out whether it can cover 
all the indirect costs that it must pay for but that aren’t directly associated with 
the product itself. You can use the gross profit margin to calculate the percentage of 
sales that are left over to cover those other expenses. Gross profit margin looks 
like this:
Gross profit
Net sales
Gross profit margin
Here’s how to put this equation to use:
1.	 Find gross profit and net sales on the income statement.
2.	 Divide gross profit by net sales to get the gross profit margin.
A high gross profit margin is a good thing as long as a company isn’t raising prices 
so high that people stop buying its products. A low gross profit margin may mean 
that the company is at risk of no longer being able to afford the costs of being in 
business. It may end up reducing the workforce or stopping operation entirely as 

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      93
a result of not being able to afford the necessary supporting functions to maintain 
its core operations. The gross profit margin is entirely a factor of market pricing 
strategy and the costs associated with doing business.
Operating ratio
The operating ratio measures the financial effectiveness of a company’s core oper-
ations. You can use the following equation to calculate this ratio:
Operating expenses
Operating revenue
Operating ratio
Follow these steps to make sense of this equation:
1.	 Find the operating expenses and revenues on the income statement.
2.	 Divide the operating expenses by the operating revenues to determine 
the operating ratio.
The answer is a measure of the ratio of assets that are taken up by expenses, all 
related to the company’s core operations. For example, if the company is an air-
line, the operating revenues are generated from ticket sales and in-flight pur-
chases, while the operating expenses include the cost of the planes, the cost of 
fuel, the wages for pilots, and everything else related directly to the transporta-
tion service.
Percent earned on operating property
After a company has its operating property (all the large machines or plants or 
vehicles it needs to do its business), it likes to determine whether this operating 
property has been capable of generating earnings. You measure the ability of a 
company’s operating property to create income by using the percent earned on 
operating property:
Net income
Operating property
Percent earned on operating property
Here’s how to put this equation to use:
1.	 Find the net income on the income statement and the operating prop-
erty on the balance sheet.
2.	 Divide the net income by the operating property.
3.	 To turn that number from a ratio to a percentage, multiply it by 100.

94      PART 2  Making a Statement
The answer is the percentage of operating assets that has generated income. For 
many companies, this ratio is sort of like the ultimate measure of whether they’re 
effectively investing in their primary operations. A low ratio may indicate that the 
company isn’t investing enough, is investing too much, or is simply investing in 
the wrong assets. A high ratio may indicate that the company is generating a high 
level of income by using the assets it has available.
Determining which ratios are high and which ones are low depends greatly on the 
specific industry, so for the percent earned on operating property to be useful, 
companies have to compare both the competition and current trends.
Operating revenue to operating  
property ratio
Whether a company can actually make any money using its operating property is 
something that managers, investors, lenders, and pretty much everyone else 
wants to know. Because companies use operating property to generate operating 
revenues (I know it’s hard to believe), they calculate the operating revenue to oper-
ating property ratio like this:
Operating revenue
Operating property
Operating revenue to operating property ratio
Work through these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find the operating revenue on the income statement and the operating 
property in the assets portion of the balance sheet.
2.	 Divide the operating revenue by the operating property.
Having an asset that doesn’t do anything to generate earnings is a waste of money. 
Particularly for companies that have large purchases with long-term usage, 
determining whether or not those large purchases are generating enough reve-
nues to make them worth the interest expense is a pretty big deal. The appropriate 
value of this ratio depends a lot on the specific industry the company works in, so 
for the ratio to be useful, companies have to compare their ratio to those of their 
competitors as well as watch for annual trends.
The operating revenue to operating property ratio should always be higher than 
the percent earned on operating property (see the preceding section). If the per-
cent earned on operating property is much lower than the operating revenue to 
operating property ratio, the company may be experiencing ineffective asset 
management in nonoperating assets or other operational efficiencies.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering Metrics      95
Long-term debt to operating property ratio
For companies that work in transportation or other industries that require a large 
degree of capital investment (think about things like big machinery or other types 
of equipment), long-term debt is a critical concern. To determine the degree of 
property that a company funds by using long-term debt, analysts use the long-
term debt to operating property ratio:
Long-term debt
Operating property
Long-term debt to operating property ratio
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find the long-term debt in the liabilities portion of the balance sheet and 
the operating property in the assets portion of the balance sheet.
2.	 Divide the long-term debt by the operating property to calculate the ratio 
of long-term debt to operating property.
The appropriate level for this ratio depends greatly on the potential growth of the 
company. When a company makes purchases of large equipment, such as buses, 
planes, or machines, the company increases the total capacity of its business. But 
because these are such large purchases, all but the largest companies likely have 
to get loans to make them. So, you can expect a high ratio for companies that are 
new or have even a moderate growth rate. This is particularly true for companies 
that have seen a recent spike in demand and need to buy larger machines/ 
­equipment to decrease their average production costs.

o one watches a company’s finances closer than the people who give that 
company money. Like a loan shark, or Sting, the people and organizations 
that invest in your company will know every move you make, every breath 
you take — they’ll be watching you.
Therefore, you may not be surprised to hear that many of the best metrics avail-
able have been developed (and are used) by people who have a financial stake in 
the success of one or more companies. The same information used by many of 
these specialists is now the gold standard for individuals who want to do some 
personal investing, for corporate management and business analysts wanting to 
know how well their company is performing for external stakeholders, and for 
employees wondering whether they’ll have a job tomorrow.
Although some of the metrics listed in this chapter truly are special use, meaning 
that they’re intended for companies from particular industries, many of them 
double as measures of a company’s asset management and financial well-being.
Sizing Up Shareholders
The analytics developed and used by investors are some of the most useful for 
businesses. Because owning stock is the same as owning a portion of the com-
pany, investor analytics often relate to profitability in earnings, efficient use of

capital, and effective asset management. And because a company’s management 
is obligated by law to maximize the shareholders’ wealth, executive wages are 
often tied to the performance of the company as measured by the analytics used 
by investors. (Shareholders are the people who own the company.) The following 
sections walk you through how to use these analytics.
Financial leverage
Pretend for a moment that you’re deciding whether to buy stock in a company. 
Now pretend that this company has borrowed money to obtain capital. The amount 
of the company that’s funded using finances with fixed repayments, such as 
loans, is the company’s degree of financial leverage. Investors, both real and pre-
tend, measure that leverage like this:
Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)
Net income (pre-tax)
Financial leverage
Here’s how to use this equation:
1.	 Find both the EBIT and the net income on the income statement near the 
bottom.
2.	 Divide the EBIT by the net income to find the financial leverage.
The goal of this measurement is to determine how much of a company’s earnings 
are being taken up by the interest incurred by the company’s loans. Investors 
receive the amount of income they earn by owning shares in the company either 
as dividends or as increased stock value. So if the company’s earnings are being 
eaten up because the company didn’t utilize debt properly, that’s a bad thing for 
investors.
Debt isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though. If the company generates more earn-
ings with the capital it raises by taking loans than the price of its interest pay-
ments, then the ratio of earnings to interest will increase, thus decreasing the 
company’s financial leverage. If the debt payments are higher than the earnings 
created using borrowed capital, then the financial leverage ratio will increase. As 
you can see, financial leverage is an excellent measure of how well a company 
utilizes debt.
Earnings per common share
When you own a company by yourself, the amount of money the company makes 
is the amount of money you earn. In contrast, when you own a share of stock, you 
still own a part of the company, but you have to split the amount of money the 

CHAPTER 8  Calculating Capital      99
company makes with everyone else who owns stock. So how much money do 
investors really make when they own a share of stock? You find out by determin-
ing the earnings per common share (EPS):
Net income
Preferred dividends
Average outstanding common shares
Earnings per common share
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find the net income and preferred dividends on the income statement 
near the bottom; preferred dividends should be below net income.
2.	 Use the balance sheets of the current year and the previous year to 
calculate the average outstanding common shares: Add the number of 
common shares outstanding from the current period and the number 
from the previous period and divide the sum by 2.
3.	 Subtract the dividends paid out to preferred shareholders (the holders of 
preferred shares) from the net income.
4.	 Divide your answer in Step 3 by your answer in Step 2; the answer is your 
earnings per share.
Companies always report their earnings per share near the bottom of their income 
statement, but having this ratio available isn’t helpful unless you know what it 
means. For investors and corporations alike, this ratio is a measure of the distri-
bution of value that the corporation is generating.
The earnings per share ratio doesn’t give any indication of the quality of a com-
pany’s earnings. Two companies that have the same earnings per share may gen-
erate their earnings using different amounts of capital, making one more efficient 
than the other. However, because earnings per share is often tied to executive pay, 
management has an incentive to generate low-quality earnings in the short term. 
This is one reason why you don’t want to rely on just one or two metrics to analyze 
a company.
Operating cash flows per share
Although earnings per share directly measures the amount investors make on 
their shares and is, therefore, the more popular investment measure used, a more 
reliable measure in terms of the company’s financial strength is the operating cash 
flows per share:
Operating cash flows
Preferred dividends
Average outstanding common shares
Operating cash flows per share

100      PART 2  Making a Statement
Here’s how to use this equation:
1.	 Find the operating cash flows in the operating cash flows portion of the 
statement of cash flows and the preferred dividends on the income 
statement near the bottom.
2.	 Use the balance sheets of the current year and previous year to calculate 
the average outstanding common shares: Add the number of outstand-
ing common shares from the current period and the number from the 
previous period and divide the sum by 2.
3.	 Subtract the value of the dividends paid to preferred shareholders from 
the operating cash flows.
4.	 Divide your answer in Step 3 by your answer in Step 2; the answer is your 
operating cash flows per share.
Because operating cash flows per share measures only the value of the company’s 
operations without considering other sources of cash flows, it better reflects the 
company’s long-term core operations. However, it doesn’t measure the compa-
ny’s full profitability as earnings per share does. In other words, use both to eval-
uate a company’s operations and profitability. The degree of differential between 
cash flows per share and earnings per share provides some idea of how the com-
pany is allocating resources. A larger differential may mean that the company is 
very inefficient, or it may mean they’re manipulating earnings.
Price to earnings ratio
Say an investor has some idea of the value of a stock but wants to know how the 
price of the stock compares to its value. The first thing the investor needs to do is 
remember that the market, not the value of the company itself, determines the 
stock’s price. Then they can estimate whether the stock is overpriced or under-
priced by calculating the price to earnings ratio (P/E):
Market price per common share
Earnings per share
Price to earnings ratio
Follow these steps to calculate the P/E:
1.	 Check the stock market online or ask your broker what the market price 
per common share is, and then calculate the earnings per share by 
following the steps I list in the earlier section “Earnings per common 
share.”
2.	 Divide the market price per common share by the company’s earnings 
per share to get the P/E ratio.

CHAPTER 8  Calculating Capital      101
In estimating the P/E, investors tend to look toward the future. The company will 
continue (it hopes) to make earnings over the course of several years, and the 
market price usually reflects that, being many times higher than the earnings of 
the company. As a result, you need to view the P/E in terms of what market inves-
tors think of the growth potential of the company. A high P/E compared to other 
companies in the same industry means that investors anticipate high growth, 
while a low P/E indicates anticipation of low growth or even negative growth.
Investors tend to be wrong . . . a lot . . . so use caution when using the P/E. Using 
other metrics, particularly those related to the balance sheet, can help add more 
context to this measure.
Percentage of earnings retained
When a corporation earns money, it can use that money in one of two ways:
»
» It can issue the money out to shareholders in the form of dividends (see the 
next section).
»
» It can keep the money as retained earnings with the intention to reinvest it 
into growing the value of the company.
Investors can use the percentage of earnings retained to evaluate how effectively a 
company is producing share value using retained earnings compared to other 
potential investments that instead yield dividends. Here’s what this measure 
looks like:
Net income
All dividends
Net income
Percentage of earnings rretained
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find the net income and all dividends on the income statement.
2.	 Add up all the dividends paid out and then subtract that number from 
the net income.
3.	 Divide the answer in Step 2 by the net income to find the percentage of 
earnings retained.
The interpretation of the percentage of earnings retained can vary. If a company 
is new or anticipates growth, then odds are it’ll have a very high percentage of 
earnings retained because it’ll need those funds to invest in the growth. If a com-
pany is stagnate and still has a very high percentage of earnings retained, it may 
be expecting problems. Small companies with growth potential that have a low 
percentage of earnings retained may also face trouble in the future or otherwise 
not meet their potential, thereby decreasing their value compared to their price.

102      PART 2  Making a Statement
Dividend payout
As I mention in the preceding section, when a company earns money, one option 
it can choose is to distribute those earnings out to its shareholders in the form of 
dividends. Investors calculate the percentage of earnings used for dividend pay-
outs to common shareholders like this:
Dividends per common share
Earnings per share
Dividend payouut
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find the dividends per common share on the income statement and 
follow the steps I list in the earlier section “Earnings per common share” 
to determine the earnings per share.
2.	 Divide the dividends per common share by the earnings per share to get 
the dividend payout.
The number you get is the percentage of earnings that dividends compose. The 
importance of this percentage is twofold:
»
» First, higher dividend payout ratios are an important part of the portfolio 
strategies of those investors who like to have a steady income from their 
investments.
»
» Second, the ratio of earnings that companies pay out in dividends provides an 
indicator of the company’s future plans for growth. Low dividend payout with 
no expansion may indicate trouble; the same is true for high dividend payout 
in a growing company.
Generally speaking, large or stagnating companies tend to have higher dividend 
payout ratios, while small or growing companies tend to retain those earnings to 
reinvest in growth.
Dividend yield
What would you be willing to pay for the dividends that a company distributes? 
For those investors who are concerned with the amount of income they’ll generate 
from the dividends on stock they own, calculating the dividend yield is critical, as 
this metric tells them how much income they’ll generate in the form of dividends 
for the price they pay on each share of stock. Comparing the dividend yield of dif-
ferent companies can help tell you whether you’re getting a competitive level of 
dividend-based income for the price:
Dividends per common share
Market price per common share
Dividend yield

CHAPTER 8  Calculating Capital      103
Here’s how to put this equation to use:
1.	 Find the dividends per common share near the bottom of the income 
statement and check the equities market or ask your broker to find the 
market price per common share.
2.	 Divide the dividends per common share by the market price per common 
share to calculate the dividend yield.
The dividend yield determines what percentage of the price investors pay for their 
shares was issued in the last year in dividends. Keep in mind that the amount of 
dividends issued each year can change, meaning that the dividend yield can be an 
unreliable measure unless the company you’re measuring has a history of main-
taining a fairly consistent dividend payout each year.
Book value per share
What is the value of a share of stock when you take away all the earnings and 
investor speculation? In other words, if a company were to go out of business and 
liquidate everything it owns, how much would each share of stock in that com-
pany be worth? To find out, investors use, in part, the book value per share:
Total shareholders’ equity
Preferred stock equity
Total outstanding common shares
Book value per share
The following steps show you how to use this equation:
1.	 Find the total shareholders’ equity and preferred stock equity in the 
equity portion of the balance sheet and the total outstanding common 
shares on the balance sheet under the equity portion (or sometimes on 
the income statement).
2.	 Subtract the preferred stock equity from the total shareholders’ equity; 
the difference is the total common equity.
3.	 Divide the total common equity by the total outstanding common shares 
to get the book value per share.
The answer you get reflects exactly how much value in assets each share of stock 
is worth, based on the book value. It’s important to note that book value is the 
amount that a company paid for its assets and will likely be higher than the 
amount it can get during liquidation, which is called market value. The book value 
per share can tell you what the company paid for everything, which would be the 
optimistic measure. Because the company must pay off all debt before the owners 
have any value at all, the book value per share shows what the company is worth 
to investors after all debt is paid off.

104      PART 2  Making a Statement
Cash dividend coverage ratio
One way to help determine the stability of a company’s dividends is by estimating 
the company’s ability to meet its dividend payouts using only operating cash 
flows. The use of operating cash flows helps indicate whether a company’s core 
operations are contributing to financial strength, which, in turn, helps investors 
estimate whether related metrics are stable. To determine how stable a company’s 
dividends are, investors calculate the cash dividend coverage ratio:
Operating cash flows
Cash dividends
Cash dividend coverage ratio
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find the operating cash flows in the operating cash flows portion of the 
statement of cash flows and the cash dividends near the bottom of the 
income statement.
2.	 Divide the operating cash flows by the cash dividends to find the cash 
dividend coverage ratio.
For investors who prefer stocks that issue dividends, this ratio can help them 
determine whether a company will continue to have stable dividends. It also dou-
bles as a way for other investors, as well as management, to calculate the compet-
itive strength and financial efficiency of the company. After all, in a way, the cash 
dividend coverage ratio represents the company’s ability to generate earnings 
beyond what’s required for the current rate of growth using only its core 
operations.
Banking on Metrics
Banks rely on a unique type of asset management to make money: They generate 
the majority of their earnings by charging interest on assets they lend out that 
were freely given to them in the form of deposits, which they pay interest on. In 
other words, banks make money by generating more interest income in loans than 
they pay to their depositors, which is called the spread.
As a bank lends out a higher percentage of its total assets, it generates more 
income along with a much higher financial risk. This unique set of core operations 
has led to the development of a number of metrics, which I cover in the following 
sections, that are very powerful in terms of assessing liquidity, financial risk, and 
effective asset management. That’s not to say that bank management actually 
uses these metrics to make effective decisions, but the information is available to 
them just as it’s available to analysts from any industry.

CHAPTER 8  Calculating Capital      105
Earning assets to total assets ratio
Of all the assets that a company owns (referred to as total assets), analysts want to 
know what percentage of them are generating income. Earning assets usually 
include any assets that are directly generating income, such as interest-generating 
investments or income-generating rentals, but in some cases, they include other 
forms of assets that directly contribute to income, such as machinery, computers, 
or anything that is directly involved in producing goods and services that will be 
sold to customers. You calculate the earning assets to total assets ratio by using this 
equation:
Average earning assets
Average total assets
Earning assets tto total assets ratio
Follow these steps to put this equation to use:
1.	 Use the balance sheets from the current year and previous year to find 
the average earnings assets and the average total assets:
•	 Add the earning assets from the current year and previous year and 
divide the answer by 2; this is the average earning assets.
•	 Add the total assets from the current year and previous year and 
divide the answer by 2; this is the average total assets.
2.	 Divide the average earning assets by the average total assets to get the 
earning assets to total assets ratio.
For companies that generate their income from loans and rentals, such as banks, 
a high ratio indicates a very efficient use of assets. A low ratio may indicate a poor 
use of assets and a need to either decrease their asset costs or improve volume. For 
all other companies, analysts can use this ratio to determine how effectively the 
companies are generating earnings with their underutilized assets. Companies in 
any industry can also include any assets that are directly involved in the produc-
tion of their products as an earning asset to evaluate their asset management.
Net interest margin
A good way to determine whether a company is effectively using its earning assets 
is to look at the proportion of income that’s being generated for the value of the 
company’s assets. In other words, you want to know if the earning assets are 
making enough money to justify the interest expense or if the company would’ve 
been better off just paying off its debts to decrease the interest expense. To find 
out, analysts use the net interest margin:
Interest returns
Interest expense
Average earning assets
Net interest margin

106      PART 2  Making a Statement
Use the following steps to work through this equation:
1.	 Find the interest returns and interest expense on the income statement.
2.	 Use the balance sheets of the current year and previous year to calculate 
the average earning assets: Add the earning assets from the current year 
and previous year and divide the answer by 2.
3.	 Subtract the interest expense from the interest returns.
4.	 Divide your answer in Step 3 by the answer in Step 2 to find the net 
interest margin.
A negative ratio means that the company is paying more in interest than it’s gen-
erating. For banks and rental companies, this means the company would be better 
off using its assets to pay off its loans than attempting to loan them out. For these 
same companies, any positive ratio is better than a negative one, but a higher ratio 
represents a more effective use of assets.
For all other companies that don’t generate a significant proportion of their 
income from interest, analysts can still use this ratio to supplement other asset-
management ratios, but it isn’t very effective on its own because interest expenses 
are typically related to total earnings rather than just interest returns.
Loan loss coverage ratio
Your “rainy day fund” is the money you set aside in case you lose your job and 
stop making money. Companies have a rainy day fund, too, and they measure it by 
using the loan loss coverage ratio:
Pretax income
Provision for loan losses
Net charge-offs
Loan loss coverage ratio
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find the pretax income near the bottom of the income statement, the 
provision for loan losses in the assets portion of the balance sheet, and 
the net charge-offs in the expenses portion of the income statement.
2.	 Add the pretax income and the provision for loan losses.
3.	 Divide the answer in Step 2 by the net charge-offs to get loan loss 
coverage ratio.
If a bank lends someone money and that person doesn’t pay it back, then the bank 
has lost that money. Likewise, if a company sells a customer a product and the 
customer never pays the bill, then the company loses that money, too. How much 

CHAPTER 8  Calculating Capital      107
money should a company keep on hand to cover these losses? If a company has too 
much money on hand to cover losses, it isn’t using its assets efficiently, but if it 
has too little on hand, it risks insolvency. Of course, decreasing the net charge-
offs is the best option, but a company should always have potential losses covered, 
as well.
Equity to total assets ratio
Some companies are particularly interested in the proportion of their total assets 
that’s comprised of equity ownership because this ratio can decrease the amount 
that they have to borrow in order to generate the same amount of earnings.  
Maintaining a high ratio of equity to total assets provides a degree of protection 
against the risk that interest payments will exceed earnings, particularly for com-
panies that generate their earnings from interest on loans or rentals. Analysts 
calculate the equity to total assets ratio using this equation:
Average equity
Average total assets
Equity to total assets ratio
Here’s how to put this equation to use:
1.	 Use the balance sheets from the current year and previous year to 
calculate the average equity and average total assets:
•	 Add the total equity of the current year and previous year and divide 
the answer by 2; this is your average equity.
•	 Add the total assets of the current year and previous year and divide 
the answer by 2; this is your average total assets.
2.	 Divide the average equity by the average total assets to get the equity to 
total assets ratio.
Investors like to calculate this ratio because it provides indications that are similar 
to the debt to equity ratio. A lower ratio may mean that the company is funding its 
assets inefficiently if it’s paying a very high amount on interest expenses. A lower 
ratio may also mean that the company has very low net value for investors.
Deposits times capital
Deposits are the primary way a bank borrows money. A customer deposits money, 
and the bank must pay that money back on request with interest. The primary 
difference between deposits and the loans taken by any other corporation is that 
deposits are loans that must be repaid on request and are often subject to cyclical 

108      PART 2  Making a Statement
fluctuations. An effective way to determine the number of times over total equity 
that deposits cover is to calculate deposits times capital:
Average deposits
Average stockholders’ equity
Deposits times capital
Use these steps to work through this equation:
1.	 Use the income statement from the current year and previous year to 
calculate the average deposits: Add the deposits from the current year 
and previous year and divide the answer by 2.
2.	 Use the balance sheets from the current year and previous year to 
calculate the average stockholders’ equity: Add the stockholders’ equity 
from the current year and previous year and divide the answer by 2.
3.	 Divide the average deposits by the average stockholders’ equity to 
calculate the deposits times capital.
This ratio is similar to the debt to equity ratio in that it can provide an idea of 
whether the bank’s earnings may be volatile or the bank itself may be at risk of 
insolvency as a result of extremely high-interest expense and account withdrawals.
Loans to deposits ratio
A very important ratio for banks to calculate is their loans to deposits ratio:
Average net loans
Average deposits
Loans to deposits ratio
Follow these steps to put this equation to use:
1.	 Use the income statements of the current year and previous year to 
calculate the average net loans and average deposits:
•	 Add the net loans of the current year and previous year and divide 
the answer by 2; this is the average net loans.
•	 Add the deposits of the current year and previous year and divide the 
answer by 2; this is the average deposits.
2.	 Divide the average net loans by the average deposits to find the loans to 
deposits ratio.
A high loans to deposits ratio means that the bank is issuing out more of its 
deposits in the form of interest-bearing loans, which, in turn, means it’ll gener-
ate more income. The problem is that the bank’s loans aren’t always repaid. Plus, 
the bank has to repay deposits on request, so having a ratio that’s too high puts 
the bank at high risk.

CHAPTER 8  Calculating Capital      109
A very low ratio means that the bank is at low risk, but it also means it isn’t using 
its assets to generate income and may even end up losing money. Analysts should 
use this ratio in conjunction with other banking ratios, particularly the loan loss 
coverage ratio (see the earlier section “Loan loss coverage ratio” for details).
Keeping Debt Healthy
Debt is a big deal. In fact, it’s such a big deal that companies value their capital 
structure based on how effectively they manage debt. Why is debt so important as 
compared to, say, equity?
»
» First, a company can have more debt than assets. Unlike equity, where the 
maximum equity is the value of all the company’s assets, debt can sur-
pass assets.
»
» Second, debt incurs interest that needs to be paid off; equity doesn’t.
»
» Third, as far as the capital structure goes, using debt as a measure usually 
provides important information about equity as well.
The following metrics are all ways to measure how well a company is managing 
its debt.
Times interest earned
When evaluating a company’s debt structure, you need to know whether a com-
pany can pay the interest it owes on the debt it has incurred. To find out, you can 
use times interest earned, which looks like this:
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
Interest expense
Times interest earned
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find EBIT near the middle or bottom of the income statement and 
interest expense somewhere below that.
2.	 Divide EBIT by interest expense to calculate the times interest earned.
A low times interest earned may mean the company is at risk of defaulting on its 
debt obligations, which is a bad sign for its level of earnings. But a very high 
interest earned may mean the company isn’t fully utilizing its available capital; 
the company could possibly generate additional sales by acquiring more debt to 

110      PART 2  Making a Statement
expand its production capacity, particularly if earnings have reached a plateau 
with the company already producing at full capacity.
Fixed charge coverage
Interest is only one form of fixed charge that a company can default on. Leases are 
another particularly common form, but there are many others, as well. To deter-
mine whether a company will default on any of these charges, you can use the 
metric called fixed charge coverage. Although this equation has a few variations, 
this one is the most common:
EBIT
Fixed charges before tax
Interest
Fixed charges before tax
Fixed charge coverage
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find EBIT, fixed charges before tax, and interest expense on the income 
statement.
2.	 Add EBIT and fixed charges before tax.
3.	 Add interest and fixed charges before tax.
4.	 Divide the answer in Step 2 by the answer in Step 3 to calculate the fixed 
charge coverage.
This metric is extremely similar to times interest earned, but adding the same 
value (fixed charges before tax) to both the top and bottom of the equation is 
guaranteed to change the end value. Fixed charge coverage is particularly impor-
tant for companies that have a high portion of fixed charges other than interest.
Debt ratio
A company with an excessive amount of debt is at very serious risk of default, so 
it’s no wonder that a company’s debt ratio is important to a number of its con-
stituents. Lenders like to know a company’s debt ratio because they want to be 
reassured that they’ll get their money back — even if the company goes out of 
business. Investors like to know a company’s debt ratio because they want to be 
reassured that they’ll be owning a company that’s worth the value of their invest-
ment. Companies themselves like to know their debt ratio to determine whether 
they’re at risk of defaulting on that debt. You can determine all this and more with 
the help of one little equation:
Total liabilities
Total assets
Debt ratio

CHAPTER 8  Calculating Capital      111
Here’s how to use this equation:
1.	 Find total liabilities in the liabilities portion of the balance sheet and total 
assets in the assets portion.
2.	 Divide total liabilities by total assets to get the debt ratio.
The debt ratio tells you what percentage of a company’s total assets were funded 
by incurring debt. A debt ratio of more than 1 means the company has more debt 
than the company is worth. A debt ratio of less than 1 means the company has 
more assets than the debt it owes. A debt ratio anywhere near 1 is a bad position 
to be in, much less a ratio higher than 1.
Debt to equity ratio
When measuring a company’s capital structure, you need to calculate the debt to 
equity ratio, which tells you the ratio that liabilities compose of a company’s fund-
ing compared to its equity. Here’s what this equation looks like:
Total liabilities
Stockholders’ equity
Debt to equity ratio
To use this equation, follow these steps:
1.	 Find total liabilities in the liabilities portion of the balance sheet and 
stockholders’ equity in the equity portion (nothing like stating the 
obvious!).
2.	 Divide total liabilities by stockholders’ equity to find the debt to equity 
ratio.
A high debt to equity ratio can mean two different things: If a company also has a 
low times interest earned, then it was probably a bit too reliant on funding opera-
tions with debt and will have a hard time paying its interest. If the company also 
has a very high times interest earned, then it was likely incurring debt to generate 
funding beyond what it could earn selling debt to generate sales. As long as the 
extra ratio of debt increases a company’s times interest earned, then the differen-
tial in earnings will increase the value of equity, balancing out the debt to equity 
ratio in the long run.
Debt to tangible net worth
If a company were to default on its debt, get bought by an investor who intends to 
sell off the assets, or otherwise go out of business, everyone involved would likely 
want to know the value of the physical assets owned by the company. You can’t 

112      PART 2  Making a Statement
sell off intellectual property when liquidating a company, so you need to use the 
ratio called debt to tangible net worth:
Total liabilities
Stockholders’ equity
Intangible assets
Debt to tangible net worth
Follow these steps to use this equation:
1.	 Find total liabilities in the liabilities portion of the balance sheet, stock-
holders’ equity in the equity portion of the income statement, and 
intangible assets in the assets portion of the income statement.
2.	 Subtract the value of intangible assets from the value of stockholders’ 
equity.
3.	 Divide total liabilities from the answer in Step 2 to find the debt to 
tangible net worth ratio.
If the ratio is greater than 1, the company has more debt than it could pay off by 
liquidating all its assets. If the ratio is less than 1, the company could pay off all its 
debt by liquidating its assets and still have some left over. In the 1980s, many 
investors purchased companies with very low debt to tangible net worth ratios 
and made profits by selling off the assets.
Operating cash flows to total debt
When possible, companies prefer not to have to sell off their assets in order to pay 
their debt. After all, having to do so is usually a sign that the company is in big 
trouble. To measure a company’s ability to pay off debt without actually selling off 
its assets, you can use the operating cash flows to total debt ratio:
Operating cash flows
Total debt
Operating cash flows to total debt
Here’s how to use this ratio:
1.	 Find operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows and total debt 
in the debt portion of the balance sheet.
2.	 Divide operating cash flows by total debt to get the operating cash flows 
to debt ratio.
A high ratio means the company is probably able to pay off its debts by using cash 
flows. A low ratio means the company may end up having to sell stuff off to pay 
its debts.

CHAPTER 8  Calculating Capital      113
Equity multiplier
The equity multiplier measures the ratio of a company’s assets that stockhold-
ers own:
Total assets
Stockholders’ equity
Equity multiplier
To put this equation to use, follow these steps:
1.	 Find total assets in the assets portion of the balance sheet and stockhold-
ers’ equity in the equity portion.
2.	 Divide total assets by stockholders’ equity to get the equity multiplier.
A ratio of 1 means that all the company’s assets are funded through equity and 
that the company has no debt. The company may have one dollar’s worth of assets 
for every dollar’s worth of equity. Even if the company increases in value, unless 
it incurs debt, that increased value will go toward increasing stockholders’ equity. 
On the other hand, a ratio of less than one means that the company used debt to 
fund its activities. Equity investors look for high equity multipliers to puff up the 
value of their investments.

oney has a tendency to change its value over time. It usually becomes 
worth less as you hold onto it for longer periods of time. The two primary 
causes for this decrease in value are increasing prices (called inflation) 
and the cost of borrowing (called interest rates). A number of variables influence 
both inflation rates and interest rates, indirectly affecting the changes in value 
over time, but for the purposes of basic corporate finance, these two forces are the 
direct causes, so they’re the ones you want to pay attention to the most.
Both inflation and interest rates, in their ability to change the value of money over 
time, play a very important role in how corporations manage their liquid assets 
and their investments. Therefore, to have even a basic understanding of corporate 
finance, you must understand what the time value of money is and how it influ-
ences corporations. This chapter is here to help! In it, I describe how and why 
money loses value over time, how this change in value impacts corporations, and 
how to properly measure and calculate changes in value over time.

Losing Value over Time
You can measure the value of money in two ways:
»
» In real terms: Real value is measured by the ability of money to be exchanged 
for other things. In other words, real value refers to the purchasing power of 
money, which includes nominal value plus inflation. (See the section on 
inflation for more details.)
»
» In nominal terms: Nominal value is very easy to measure because it’s simply a 
measure of the number of units of currency you have — that is, the volume of 
money. For instance, $10 will always have a nominal value of $10. A $1 coin, 
even if it’s made of pure diamond and is sought after by collectors for billions 
of dollars, still has a nominal value of just $1.
Only the real value of money, not the nominal value, is influenced by time. So, $10 
will still be $10 next year (its nominal value), but it’ll purchase less than it does 
this year (its real value). This distinction is very important because the goal of 
corporations is to ensure that their nominal value increases faster than the real 
value of each unit of currency decreases. In other words, they want to make more 
money faster than the money they have loses its value.
The following sections take a look at the two main factors that cause money to 
change real value over time.
Inflation
Inflation is when a currency’s ability to purchase goods (that is, its purchasing 
power) is diminished  — that is to say, when its purchasing power decreases, 
causing people to spend more units of currency to acquire an equal quantity of 
goods.
The three forms of inflation are
»
» Cost push: The cost of production increases, raising prices. For example, a 
drought might force farmers to spend more money on water to grow corn, 
forcing them to increase prices in order to avoid losing money.
»
» Demand pull: The market wants more of something than current production 
will allow, requiring producers to purchase additional production capacity. For 
example, if oil suddenly runs out and people rely more heavily on ethanol-
based fuel, corn farmers will sell at much higher prices until their own average 
cost of meeting demand decreases.

CHAPTER 9  Determining Present and Future Values: Time Is Money      119
»
» Monetary inflation: The government wildly starts printing vast amounts of 
money. If more money is available than the value of goods being produced, 
each unit of money is worth a smaller fraction of the market. This usually 
results in “hyperinflation,” where a currency becomes totally worthless.
You know how things are more expensive than they used to be? Remember how 
the price of (insert the name of a consumer good here) used to be lower than it is 
now? That’s inflation.
Say that inflation is 1 percent per year on average. That means that every single 
year, you need 1 percent more money to purchase goods than you did the year 
before. In most cases, people also make 1 percent more money in wages than they 
did the year before, so generally speaking, people are earning and spending more 
money to maintain an equivalent quality of life.
Here’s another example: If inflation is 1 percent per year and you own $100, over 
the course of 10 years, that $100 will lose 10 percent of its value as measured by its 
ability to purchase goods.
Inflation can also work in reverse. Deflation occurs when money increases in value, 
meaning it’s able to purchase more goods for an equivalent price. Because of how 
economists around the world currently manage their respective national econo-
mies, deflation happens only during very bad recessions.
Interest rates
Interest rates are the other primary influence on the value of money over time. 
The interest rate is the rate of return you make on an interest-bearing asset or the 
rate you pay when you borrow money. So if you have a bank account that gener-
ates 1 percent interest per year, then you’ll have 1 percent more money in that 
account next year than you have this year, assuming that you don’t touch the bank 
account during that year. If interest rates are increasing the amount of money you 
have at exactly the same rate that inflation is decreasing the value of each dollar, 
then you can continually purchase the same amount of goods using the money in 
that bank account.
The way in which interest rates decrease the value of assets is a bit more abstract 
than inflation and has to do with the opportunity cost of holding an asset. Oppor-
tunity cost measures the loss of forgoing the next best option. For example, the 
opportunity cost of making an investment that earns 2 percent interest may be the 
1 percent returns of the next best investment.

120      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Opportunity cost becomes a problem when the next best investment is actually 
better than the one you chose. For instance, if you buy a certificate of deposit (CD) 
that makes 2 percent per year and then the very next day the interest rate on CDs 
increases to 3 percent, you’re generating less nominal value on your investment 
than the market is currently offering. In other words, you’re losing 1 percent per 
year by having the wrong CD because you’re earning less interest than what’s 
being offered.
Predicting Future Value
Welcome to the world of tomorrow! No, not some science fiction landscape with 
cars winding through puffy clouds high in the sky. In this case, you can visit the 
world of tomorrow simply by calculating future value!
The future value of an asset refers to the amount of value that you estimate some-
thing will have at any point in the future. Want to know what a machine will be 
worth after 5 years? Want to know how much your bank account will be worth in 
6 months? You can measure both things using future value.
The vast majority of future value calculations are functions of just three 
variables:
»
» Present value (see the preceding section)
»
» Rate
»
» Time
All future value calculations are just a matter of determining how much revenue 
an investment will generate over a period of time at the interest rate offered by 
that particular investment. Two of the most commonly used future value equa-
tions in corporate finance involve interest rates. I explain these equations in the 
following sections. You use the same calculations to determine the cost of debt for 
a corporation.
Simple interest

CHAPTER 9  Determining Present and Future Values: Time Is Money      121
The equation shows that for any asset that earns fixed-rate interest, the future 
value (FV) of the asset will be worth the present value (PV) multiplied by the func-
tion of interest rate (r) and time duration (t) plus 1. Here’s a quick example to 
show you how this equation works: Say you buy an investment for $100 that yields 
1 percent interest per year and you hold it for 10 years. To determine the future 
value of that investment, simply plug these numbers into the simple interest 
equation:
FV

When you multiply rate and time in this equation, you get 0.1, and when you mul-
tiply that by the PV of $100, you get $10. That’s the total amount of increase in 
nominal value that the interest will have earned over 10 years. Although that’s 
good to know, you need to include the total amount you put into the account in the 
first place (the PV) in order to determine the future value of the investment as a 
whole. So, you just add 1 to the 0.1, and multiply that by the original $100, result-
ing in a future value of $110.
Compound interest
Compound interest is similar to simple interest, except that accounts earning com-
pound interest generate interest on the interest earned rather than just on the 
principal balance. Although this difference adds some complexity to the equation 
you use to calculate the future value of an investment that earns compound inter-
est, the basic components are still the same, as you can see here:
FV
PV
r
n

[(
(
)) ]

Here, n refers to the numbers of times compounded per year. So, if interest is 
compounded quarterly, n is 4. If interest is compounded continuously, the math-
ematical constant e is used.
Calculating the Present Value
Just as you can calculate the nominal and real value of the future of corporate cash 
and investments, so, too, can you calculate the current nominal and real value of 
future cash and investments not yet realized.

122      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
The ability to estimate the value of something today that will change value over 
time is essential not only to buying and selling assets, it’s also a critical element 
of tracking the progress and efficiency of capital assets in an organization.
When you purchase a piece of capital like a machine you may have some estimates 
of the value that it will create for your organization and you may even have some 
projections on the returns on investment it will generate, but you can’t just sit 
back and assume your estimates were correct.
By tracking the amount of value it produces at specific intervals of time, you can 
check to see how accurate you were and make adjustments along the way. This 
becomes especially important if you plan to sell that capital, if you’re buying used 
capital, or if you deal with any sort of other investments such as bonds or 
derivatives.
To help you better understand what present value is, consider a lottery win: If you 
take all $1 million that you won right away and put it in investments that generate 
1 percent interest, that million dollars will be worth more in ten years than it 
would be if you accepted annual $100,000 payments for ten years. In the former 
of the two options, you earn an extra $1,000 in interest over ten years. In the latter 
option, you earn less interest, so the future payments are worth less than the cur-
rent payments.
Although this is a helpful example for lottery winners, it doesn’t really explain 
how most people use present value calculations, particularly in corporate finance. 
That’s where the following sections come into play.
A closer look at earnings
When you calculate present value, what you’re actually doing is looking more 
closely at earnings or cash flows that you or your corporation will make in the 
future. For example, you can apply present value to bond investments in which 
the investors know exactly how much money they will earn nominally and when 
(the exact date) they will receive that money. In cases like this, where you know 
all the information upfront, you can determine how much of the total future value 
you have already accumulated at any given point by using the following equation:
PV
FV
rt
(
)

Here’s what the variables in this equation mean:
»
» PV = Present value
»
» FV = Future value

CHAPTER 9  Determining Present and Future Values: Time Is Money      123
»
» r = Rate
»
» t = Time (in years)
»
» 1 = Percentage constant
To use this equation, consider this example: The interest rate for a one-year 
investment is 5 percent and the future value is $100. To find the present value, 
simply plug and chug:
PV
PV
PV
$
.
$

100
1
0 05 1
100
1 05
95 24
So, the present value for this example is about $95. If the interest rate were only 
4 percent, then the present value of a $100 future cash flow is about $96. The 
present value is higher in this case because the difference between the present 
value and the future value is smaller given the lower interest rate.
Another way of looking at present value is that the more interest you earn or pay 
on future cash flows, either by way of higher interest or longer-term holdings, the 
less the present value will be. In the case of higher interest, the present value will 
increase at a much faster rate over time, while longer-term holdings will increase 
at the same rate but simply take longer to fully mature.
Being able to determine the present value of each potential investment, purchase, 
or cash flow before committing to it can help you and your company make the best 
possible decisions. For instance, in making a large purchase that could include 
multiple payments, you can calculate whether your company would be better off 
paying for the item outright or making monthly payments with interest while 
keeping the remaining funds in an interest-generating account of some sort.
Discounted cash flows
Another term for present value is the discount value, which comes from the fact 
that you’re taking a known future value and discounting it at the interest rate in 
question. The reason for this distinction in nomenclature is that discount rate and 
discounted cash flows are a lot easier to say than present value calculation rate or pres-
ent value rate of future cash flows. Beyond that, there’s no difference.
So, although I talk about discounted cash flows, the only functional difference 
from present value is that I’m talking specifically about exchanges in cash rather 
than simply value generated. In other words, I’m talking about cash flows instead 
of value, but present value and discounted value don’t have a functional 
difference.

124      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
That being said, discounted cash flows refer to a situation in which multiple cash 
flows will appear on a single transaction. For example, when your company pur-
chases a large item, each cash payment you make is considered a cash flow. When 
your company invests in a coupon bond, each payment you receive is a cash flow. 
If your company purchases a machine for producing inventory, then both the 
future costs of buying and operating that machine and the value of the inventory 
created by that machine in the future are measured as discounted cash flows, 
whereby each individual cash flow is discounted to its present value.
Even though each cash flow will likely have the same interest rate, each one will 
have a different present value because each one is at a different point in time. So, 
the present value of the most chronologically distant cash flows will be the lowest.
Here’s what the discounted cash flow equation looks like:
DCF
CF
rt
CF
rt
n

The variables in this equation are fairly simple to define:
»
» DCF = Value of discounted cash flows
»
» CF1 = Cash flow number 1
»
» r = Rate
»
» t = Time (in years)
»
» CFn = Cash flow number n; whichever cash flow you want to measure (often, 
but not necessarily, treated as the last cash flow)
»
» 1 = Percentage constant
All this equation really means is that you add up all the present values of future 
cash flows to determine the value of discounted cash flows, also known as the 
net present value.
When you add up all the discounted cash flows of a particular account, invest-
ment, or loan, you get a value called the net present value (NPV). For now, you just 
need to know that if a particular asset is going to generate multiple future cash 
flows, then each of those cash flows has its own present value. When you add up 
those present values, you get the net present value.

hen you think of investments, you probably think of things like stocks 
and bonds. These are types of investments, sure, but they’re only one 
class of investment, called financial investments. These investments are 
made in financial products and, for most businesses, they aren’t even the primary 
type of investment. That honor goes to a different type of investment, called a 
capital investment.
Considering how important capital investment is to every corporation, it comes as 
quite a relief that capital budgeting is an easy thing to perform. Throughout this 
chapter I show you how capital budgeting happens, including calculating the rates 
of returns on capital, determining the value of cash flows and the salvage value of 
equipment once it’s no longer of use, calculating the payback period for the cost 
of capital, and determining the current value of capital at any given point in time. 
I also explain how to track expected and present values, how to efficiently manage 
inventory, and how to manage working capital and economic capital. Plus, I tell 
you how all the preceding factors can be applied to project management.

Budgeting Capital
Just about everything corporations spend money on can be considered an invest-
ment. Because corporations manage other people’s money, nothing they spend 
that money on is supposed to be for personal gain or enjoyment; rather, it’s sup-
posed to be used to generate returns for the owners of the corporation, who are 
the stockholders. So, every dollar a corporation spends should contribute to the 
increased value of the corporation in some way. But that’s not always the case, 
because many corporations are very wasteful. Plus, you don’t really need to mea-
sure the returns on every single dollar. I honestly don’t think anyone cares how 
much value a paper clip adds to the total output of a corporation.
When it comes to larger expenditures, though, you start to run into matters of 
potential returns and capital budgeting. When a corporation is considering buying 
land, a new plant, or new machinery; offering a new line or product; or starting a 
new project; all these undertakings need to be carefully analyzed from a financial 
standpoint to determine their potential returns and risk before any action is taken.
This is where capital budgeting comes into play. The name may be a little mis-
leading, because capital budgeting really has more to do with evaluating the 
potential of capital investments than actual budgeting; but the process was orig-
inally used to budget resource allocations, which is why it’s called capital budget-
ing. Capital budgeting is the process by which you evaluate the financial potential 
for each of one or more possible capital investments. In those cases where several 
options are available, but the corporation has enough resources to pursue only 
one, each option must be compared against the others in order to determine which 
one will yield the greatest returns.
The implications of the evaluation go beyond simply making allocation decisions, 
though. The information that you derive from these financial valuations plays a 
big role in the financial projections for the entire corporation, its resource budget-
ing, its liquidity and asset management, and almost every other aspect of the 
corporation’s finances and operations. The exact nature of the corporation’s capi-
tal investments determines what production volume the corporation is capable of 
handling, how profitable and financially efficient it will be, and even how it sets 
its pricing strategies. The operational and cost efficiencies that the entire corpo-
ration experiences are largely influenced by its capital budgeting decisions.

CHAPTER 10  Calling in the Cavalry      127
Rating Your Returns
Say that you’re getting ready to invest in a new piece of capital — a machine that 
paints penguins yellow — but before you fork over $1 million for this “business 
venture,” you want to know whether it’s going to be profitable. What you want to 
do is calculate the rate of return on the machine. This rate is the ratio of revenues 
to costs associated with purchasing something. If it’s positive, you’re making 
more money than you’re spending. As you undoubtedly know, corporations  
like money, so that’s a good thing. If the rate of return is negative, you’re losing 
money. Corporations don’t like to lose money.
The rate of return is usually measured in terms of years, though any duration of 
time is possible: months, weeks, days, hours . . . it really depends on the life of the 
investment and the amount of work you feel like doing.
I’m the type of person who likes to make things easy. That’s why when I’m doing 
capital budgeting, the first thing I like to do is determine the rate of return on a 
potential investment. The reason I do this first is because it allows me to very eas-
ily eliminate any potential investments that won’t be profitable or that will be 
significantly less profitable than other options.
For example, if an investment can only hope to generate 1 percent annual returns 
per year but a local credit union pays 3 percent per year on a savings account, 
you’re better off just putting the money in the savings account. So, you want to 
figure out exactly what kind of potential each project has before you do anything 
else with your data, because that helps you avoid a lot of extra work that doesn’t 
need to be done. Sound good? I thought you’d like that.
The first thing you need in order to calculate the rate of return is data. Regarding 
any potential project, you need to know the following items:
»
» Pricing and financing costs
»
» Operating costs
»
» Output volume
»
» Lifespan
»
» Revenues
Together, that’s just five things you need in order to do all the calculations I talk 
about in this chapter. For this particular section, your only concern is the rate of 
return, but you can take satisfaction in knowing that you won’t need anything 
more for the rest of the chapter, either.

128      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Looking at costs
When you buy new capital, odds are it’s expensive to both buy and maintain. So, 
you really have three separate costs to consider:
»
» The purchase cost
»
» The interest rate you pay on the loan you take to buy the machine
»
» The cost of keeping/maintaining the machine
The cost of the purchase also likely includes a tax expense, but when it comes time 
to start doing equations, I try to keep everything easy.
Calculating revenue
After you calculate your costs, you need to figure out your revenue — you would-
n’t be willing to pay all that money unless you were going to generate some rev-
enues as a result, right? So, take a look at revenues. For the purposes of this book, 
you need to be concerned with only two major types of revenue:
»
» The sale of any product the machine makes
»
» The salvage value
In the real world, you also have tax savings in the form of depreciation. Plus, you 
likely need more than one machine to create a single finished product, so the rev-
enues generated by that machine account for only a proportion of the total sales 
revenues, based on the amount of value that machine contributes to the final 
product. More capital simply means repeating the calculations, though, so while 
they add a bit more work, they’re not truly new so I don’t go over them again.
Calculating the accounting rate of return
The simplest rate of return to calculate is the accounting rate of return (ARR). This 
is a very fundamental calculation to determine how much value an investment 
generates for the corporation and its owners, the stockholders. It requires only 
two pieces of information: the amount of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) 
generated by the project and the cost of the investment. Once you know those two 
things, the calculation goes like this:
ARR = EBIT attributed to project ÷ Net investment

CHAPTER 10  Calling in the Cavalry      129
The accounting rate of return is calculated by dividing the amount of EBIT gener-
ated by the project by the net investment of the project. This calculation tells you 
the proportion of net earnings before taxes that you’re generating for the invest-
ment cost. This calculation is usually done on a year-by-year basis. Note that 
because this equation doesn’t take multi-period variables into consideration, you 
have to calculate it anew for each period (usually a year). So, in year 1, you might 
calculate a –3 percent rate of return. That sounds bad, but if you’re talking about 
the investment on developing a whole new product line, you need to consider that 
sales are usually slow during the first year. By year 3, you might expect a 2 percent 
rate of return, and so forth.
You may be asking how to determine the amount of EBIT to attribute to a given 
project! The answer isn’t too bad. Basically, you just go through the steps of 
developing an income statement (see Chapter 5), but only for the new project. 
Find out how many sales this new line or product is generating, and then subtract 
the costs of operating the project. That’s simple, right? Fine. Now I add just a little 
bit more complexity to show you how to do this for a single machine rather than 
a whole new project.
When your capital investment is just a single step in the production process, 
determining how much value is being added by that step takes a little more work. 
Basically, you have to break down the entire production process into its individual 
contributing steps. The total production process is 100 percent of the final product.
There are a couple ways to determine what percentage of the production process 
a single step constitutes. One way is to simply use a proportion of the total cost of 
production. Sure, this method is easy, but there’s a better way: You can do some-
thing called transfer pricing, which estimates the market value of each step in the 
process by doing some research to find out how much it would cost to hire some 
other company to do that step. This method helps you in two ways:
»
» It helps you do your capital budgeting by determining the amount of added 
value for that single step and the amount of EBIT you can attribute to that 
step, to make sure that the investment will generate a positive return on 
investment.
»
» It determines the fair market value of performing that step to see whether 
your company is being financially efficient. If some other company can 
perform that step better or more cheaply, you should probably outsource that 
step to the other company.
If you know the lifespan of the project or machine, you can forecast the rate of 
return you experience each year. Whether you’re successful at this forecast will 
depend entirely on how closely your forecasts match the actual rate of returns, of 

130      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
course, but you can still do these forecasts. The total rate of return on the invest-
ment is the total EBIT generated by that investment divided by the cost of the 
investment. The revenues used to calculate EBIT include all the revenues that 
investment generates over its entire life, plus the final revenue generated using its 
salvage or scrap value. The final revenue generated by any project is its scrap or 
salvage value. I talk about how to calculate salvage value in Chapter 4. Here, you 
apply that calculation as the forecast for the final revenues generated by any capi-
tal investment.
Making the most of the internal rate of 
return through modification
The accounting rate of return is helpful, but it’s so simple that it’s extremely lim-
ited in its ability to provide you with information that’s useful in your attempt to 
manage assets, investments, and projects. For that, you have something called the 
modified internal rate of return (MIRR). Modified!? Yeah. The internal rate of 
return (IRR) is a good equation, but it has some faults that are easily rectified, so 
no one really even brings it up anymore.
The IRR is a calculation that attempts to take the net future cash flows of a project 
(all the positive and negative cash flows of the project) and the discount rate at 
which the present value of the net cash flows is zero. Think of it like this: A project 
is worth $0 at the beginning because it hasn’t produced anything. So, in order to 
determine the IRR, you attempt to calculate the rate at which the net present value 
of future cash flows is 0. That rate is the IRR.
There are a couple problems with the IRR, though:
»
» It automatically assumes that all cash flows from the project are reinvested at 
the IRR rate, which isn’t realistic in most cases.
»
» It has difficulty comparing projects that have differing durations and cash 
flows.
Otherwise, the IRR can be used to evaluate a single project or single cash flow.
The MIRR tends to be more accurate in its costs and profitability of projects, 
though, and because the MIRR is a more robust equation with wider applications, 
I jump to that now and forget about the IRR.
You use the following equation to calculate the MIRR:
MIRR
FV
PV
 Positive Cash Flows, Reinvestment)
 Cost, Rate
(
(
)
n
1

CHAPTER 10  Calling in the Cavalry      131
where:
n = Number of periods
FV = Future value
PV = Present value
Positive Cash Flows = The revenues/value contributions to revenues from the 
project
Reinvestment = The rate generated from reinvesting future cash flows
Cost = The investment cost
Rate = The rate of financing the investment
1 = A number
Most of the time, the reinvestment rate of MIRR is set at the corporation’s cost of 
capital. Of course, that depends a lot on how efficient the corporation is in its 
financial management, so I tend to keep it an open variable based more on evalu-
ations of the corporations’ financial performance. Anyway, the following quick 
example shows you how to calculate the MIRR of a project.
Say that a project lasting only two years with an initial investment cost of $2,000 
and a cost of capital of 10 percent will return $2,000  in year 1, and $3,000  in 
year 2.
Reinvested at a 10 percent rate of return, you compute the future value of the posi-
tive cash flows as follows:
$2,000(1.10) + $3,000 = $5,200 at the end of the project’s lifespan of two years.
Now you divide the future value of the cash flows by the present value of the initial 
cost, which is $2,000, to find the geometric return for two periods:
$ ,
/ ,
.

Note that this calculation doesn’t take a financing cost into account. That’s okay, 
because most corporations can afford $2,000 with no problem, and I’m trying to 
keep the example simple. Also note that had we used the IRR instead of the MIRR, 
the rate of return would have been substantially higher, but also substantially less 
accurate.

Netting Present Values
One of the core calculations used in capital budgeting is net present value (NPV). 
Net present value is calculated using the following equation:
NPV
C
r
C
t
t
T
T
1
0
1
This equation says that you add up all the present values of all future cash inflows, 
and then subtract the sum of the present value of all future cash outflows. In other 
words, you take the present value of all future cash flows, both positive and nega-
tive, and then add and subtract as appropriate. If the equation looks more compli-
cated than the description, that’s just because of how equations are built. The big 
“E”-looking symbol is called sigma, and it simply means to add things together — 
in this case, the present value of future cash flows.
In the case of capital investments, the cash flows come in the form of revenues 
and costs. Well, that’s true with all cash flows, I guess, but these are a little dif-
ferent because they’re operating revenues and costs, rather than financing cash 
flows, investing cash flows, or even “other” types of cash flows. In other words, 
these directly influence the primary operations of the corporation. So, the positive 
cash flows come from the sale of goods and services, as well as the rate of return 
generated through the reinvestment of the positive cash flows. If the investment 
is part of a larger process, as discussed in the earlier section “Calculating the 
accounting rate of return,” you attribute only those revenues that compose an 
equal proportion of the total value that this particular investment contributed to 
the final product. The costs of each present value include the financing costs, 
costs of maintenance and operations, and the interest paid for financing the 
investment. All cash flows are assumed, of course, to be discounted at the antici-
pated inflation rate.
Calculating NPV over time
What makes NPV special to capital budgeting isn’t projecting the total value of a 
potential capital investment (I talk about that and use similar calculations in the 
section “Making the most of the internal rate of return through modification”); it’s 
that you can continue to calculate NPV over time. Over the duration of a project’s 
life, the project’s NPV decreases over time. It has less life and fewer unrealized cash 
flows because it has already generated revenues in the past. Performing these cal-
culations allows you to do several things regarding earned value management:
»
» It allows you to determine the value of an investment over the course of its 
life. That’s great for evaluating corporate value and future operating potential.

CHAPTER 10  Calling in the Cavalry      133
»
» It allows you to estimate the market value of an investment at any given point 
for use as collateral or to determine its liquidation value. Yes, that’s a grim 
scenario, but it’s the sort of thing you should be aware of.
»
» It gives vital information about the reinvestment of the net cash flows up until 
that point.
Managing the project’s value
When you take the NPV of a project at time t (which is any year during the project), 
you can add the actual returns generated up until that point and more closely 
manage the project’s value. Forecasts are always estimates, some more accurate 
than others, so when the period for a forecast has passed or is in the process of 
passing, you want to check and see how close you were to the forecast. Then the 
corporation can adjust its financial outlook accordingly. The net cash flows gener-
ated so far are called earned value. Earned value is calculated like this:
EV
PV Completed
Start
Current
(
)
All this equation really says is that you take all the present values (PV) you’ve 
completed and add them together. That big thing that looks kind of like a drunk 
“E” is called a sigma (a capital sigma, not to be confused with a lowercase sigma, 
which I describe later in the book). It means you add things together. The “start” 
on the bottom means that you begin with the start of the project. The “current” 
on top means you end with the current period, without going further. So, you add 
together cash flows from the beginning until “now” (whenever “now” is), and 
that’s your earned value. It’s not necessarily what you may expect, though.
Maybe you are generating higher rates of returns than you expected from your 
MIRR calculations; in this case, your earned value is higher than your planned 
value at some point in time. If your earned value is lower than planned, you are 
generating lower returns than projected. In either case, it’s probably a good idea 
to find out what the percentage of difference is and why it occurred. Even if you 
are getting higher returns than planned, you want to know why so you can try for 
a repeat performance. Trust me on this.
Basically, tracking the NPV of a given project allows you to manage the project 
more effectively, manage finances and resources more efficiently, and better plan 
for the future. These tasks form the fundamentals of project management, which 
I discuss briefly at the end of this chapter.

Compared to the preceding section, I promise this one is short and sweet. This 
section is about the payback period, which is the number of periods it will take to 
pay back the initial investment on a piece of capital. In other words, it’s the num-
ber of years it will take for a corporation to break even on its new capital invest-
ment. The payback period is a crucial calculation not only for projecting the cash 
flows, interest payments, and other value management techniques for the invest-
ment, but also for projecting the influence of the project on the entire corpora-
tion’s asset management and profitability. It’s calculated like this:
Payback period = Initial investment/Net annual cash flows
Start with your initial investment; then just divide it by your average net cash 
flows. For example, say you spend $10,000 on a piece of capital. This piece of capi-
tal will generate, on average, an extra $1,000 in EBIT to your corporation and has 
a lifespan of 20 years. The calculation to figure out your payback period on this 
piece of equipment looks like this: 10,000/1,000 = 10 years. It will take you ten 
years to repay the investment on capital. Those net cash flows generated from the 
remaining ten years of the life of the investment are pure profit. Nicely done!
This calculation assumes, of course, that the initial investment is made all at once. 
It doesn’t have to be, though. For very large investments, you can take the future 
value of all amortization payments and use that as your initial investment. In 
other words, if you have an investment that’s so large you need to finance it and 
repay the investment over the course of many years, just add up all the negative 
cash flows. This process of spreading out the payments of a cost is called amorti-
zation. Calculating the payback period for an amortized investment only works 
with fixed interest rates, though, where the nominal amount you repay isn’t going 
to change over time. With variable rate loans, the calculation becomes a little 
trickier mathematically and is beyond the scope of this book.
Allocating Capital
It’s time to take a look at how all the information presented in the previous sec-
tions comes together to allow you to make useful decisions regarding capital allo-
cations. You have done a lot of calculations relevant to determining the value and 
profitability of a capital investment at any given point in time, but what about 
comparing different potential investments? Remember that every investment has 
an opportunity cost — the loss of the next best option — so corporations really 
need to ensure that they’re picking the best option, and that includes, potentially, 
no capital investment at all.

CHAPTER 10  Calling in the Cavalry      135
Calculating the equivalent annual cost
Probably the best place to start is by calculating the equivalent annual cost of each 
potential investment. You calculate this as follows:
EAC
NPV /[
]
1
1
Discount rate
n
Basically, this equation allows you to compare the annual costs of potential 
investments with differing duration periods and cash flows in an apples-to- 
apples approach.
The real test of whether any of the potential investments are successful will 
depend greatly on the ability of the corporation to derive value from the project, 
however. Just because it now has the capacity to create something, doesn’t mean 
it can create the demand or make it work. To figure that out, you need to incorpo-
rate a calculation for capital efficiency:
CE = Output/Expenditures
Once you have an idea of the amount of actual output being generated by an actual 
project, you can understand a few additional bits of information. First of all, you 
can determine the amount of cash flows at a given rate of efficiency, and the 
degree to which that efficiency must increase in order to increase the NPV of the 
project. The percentage of deviation between current performance value and 
planned NPV is equivalent to the amount of increased efficiency that the corpora-
tion must derive from the investment.
Next, the estimate at completion (EAC; see the section “Estimate at completion” 
near the end of this chapter for more on this value) is then used to determine 
which one of several potential investments is going to generate the greatest 
returns for the corporation. Thanks to the equivalency of the analysis, whichever 
option has the highest EAC is the best one. Go with it. Unless, of course, they’re all 
either low or even negative. If they’re all negative, you’ll lose money on all of 
them, and you shouldn’t invest in any of the options. If they’re all low enough that 
you are better off putting those investments into some sort of financial invest-
ment or bank account, then it’s probably best to go with that option.
The next logical topic of discussion is liquid asset management. This is a very fre-
quent analysis of whether it’s better to allocate resources toward liquid assets 
with low returns but low risk or long-term assets, which usually have higher 
returns but higher risk. Of course, as noted, if your long-term potential assets 
have low returns, then why take on the additional risk? Just go with the liquid 
investments.

136      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Considering liquid assets
Allocating resources and assets into capital investments is about more than just 
long-term assets. Although long-term assets tend to get the most attention 
because of their high cost and higher risk, liquid assets must also be evaluated for 
their performance and returns. Whether you put money into a long-term asset or 
a liquid account will be determined, in large part, by the amount of liquidity risk 
the corporation is facing as well as its estimated future cash flows.
All corporations, of course, want to generate the highest rate of returns that they 
can from every single penny they own. Of course, this is impossible given the tim-
ing of their costs and expenditures, so they need to maintain a type of extremely 
short-term liquid assets: economic capital. Basically, economic capital is all the 
money that’s kept in banks, cash, or anything else that can be immediately liqui-
dated to pay for daily cash requirements.
Any money kept in economic capital is money that isn’t put into investments. 
Therefore, carefully assessing liquidity risk, cash requirements, and future cash 
flows is an important part of efficiently utilizing your assets to generate returns. 
You may be awfully tempted to invest more money than is operationally wise into 
investments in order to maximize the rate of returns, but that’s a temptation you 
must avoid.
The other form of liquid asset you need to consider for the purposes of this chap-
ter is called inventory. Inventory includes all the assets that are going to be sales; 
including finished products, work-in-process, and raw materials. These very liq-
uid assets not only keep a corporation from investing, but also cost money to keep 
in storage. That’s why many corporations are now paying very careful attention to 
and innovating in the field of inventory management. The ultimate goal is JIT 
inventory management; JIT stands for just-in-time.
To provide some perspective on what this means, the following list contains some 
descriptions of the progression of production. Each phase has its own costs and 
valuations; JIT works to reduce the costs associated with each step as much as 
possible, ensuring that the final outlet for the sale receives their inventory just as 
they run out (ideally, in very small quantities delivered frequently).
»
» Finished products: These are products that are ready to be sold. They’re 
completely finished and storing them until they’re bought costs money. Direct 
sales tend to be cheaper because the costs of storage and distribution are 
lower without retailers, particularly for made-to-order products.
»
» Work-in-process: These are products that have been started but aren’t yet 
complete. Decreasing the amount of time in-process can cut costs and 
increase rates of return.

CHAPTER 10  Calling in the Cavalry      137
»
» Raw materials: These are materials that haven’t yet begun to be processed. 
The majority of inventory management is focused here, ensuring that 
materials don’t arrive before they’re really needed.
The cost of inventory comes primarily from storage. Just like any other capital 
investment, the increased expenditures required for space to store and maintain 
inventory, known as the cost of inventory, can reduce the rate of returns generated 
by selling this form of inventory as capital. JIT attempts to manage the supply 
chain by ensuring that inventory in its various forms arrives immediately when 
it’s needed but not a moment sooner. This strategy ensures that inventory remains 
available while reducing the costs associated with inventory.
By applying NPV to inventory management, you can see that JIT can dramatically 
increase the rate of returns on capital. By shortening the duration of capital in 
inventory, the NPV of inventory increases almost instantly. The results are 
twofold:
»
» Corporations can generate returns on the money that otherwise would have 
been allocated to inventory in the meantime.
»
» Corporations can reduce the opportunity costs associated with short-term 
liquid assets.
Managing Projects
Project management is a very complex topic that involves a wide range of special-
izations in management. For the purposes of this book, the only aspect you need 
to be concerned with is the evaluation and control of the project’s finances, which 
are calculated using information about earned value management (EVM). EVM 
allows you to calculate, quite accurately, the amount of value being contributed to 
or derived from an investment project. Understanding the nature of this evalua-
tion and ensuring that everything remains on schedule, under budget, and, most 
of all, efficiently profitable, are the goals of this section.
Value schedule metrics
As explained in Chapter 9, time is money. So anytime that there’s a deviation in 
the schedule regarding when a project will be completed or when it will reach cer-
tain milestones in earned value, there’s a problem. Not only do you have a prob-
lem if you are falling behind, which is especially bad, but you also have a problem 
if the project is generating value ahead of schedule to the extent that the corpora-
tion’s assets could have been managed more efficiently.

138      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Schedule variation
The deviation between earned value (EV) at time t and planned value (PV) for time 
t is called the schedule variation (SV), and it’s calculated using the following 
equation:
SV
EV
PV
This equation says that the schedule variation is equal to the earned value less the 
planned value. Think of it like this: If the earned value that you have generated at 
any given point in time is equal to the value that you planned to have generated at 
that point in time, then schedule variation will be 0. Being above 0 is also a good 
thing, but it still warrants an explanation so you can figure out how to improve 
projections or repeat successes in the future. If the schedule variation is less than 
0, people will likely start to get mad at you.
There are two explanations for having a negative SV:
»
» The project simply may not be generating as much value as anticipated. 
This scenario can be fairly easily discovered by auditing each of the cash flows 
from the investment to determine why cash flows are deviating from their 
planned net value, and whether that trend will continue or will influence the 
total rate of returns for the life of the investment.
»
» Earned value simply may be taking longer to actualize. Perhaps the 
operating cycle is longer than expected. Merely being behind schedule, rather 
than under planned value, is certainly the less harmful scenario, although 
neither situation is good.
Schedule performance
Another way to look at the variance between EV and PV is through a ratio calcula-
tion called schedule performance (SP). It’s calculated as follows:
SV
EV
PV
/
This equation essentially says that SP equals earned value (EV) divided by planned 
value (PV). SP can be measured using time increments or dollar-denominated 
value increments. For example, if a project is taking longer than expected, that 
would be a deviation in SPt whereas a deviation in dollar value would be measured 
in SP$ (or whatever other currency you are using).
An SP of 1 means that the investment is generating value exactly as planned. Less 
than 1 means that the project is coming in behind schedule or under value. More 
than 1 means that the project is coming in ahead of schedule or over value. In both 
of the latter two cases, the corporation isn’t using its assets as effectively as it 

CHAPTER 10  Calling in the Cavalry      139
could be. Even if the investment is generating more value than anticipated, the 
corporation has no plan in place to reinvest that surplus income to optimize 
returns. Perhaps it could have pursued another investment with it, or more effec-
tively managed its economic capital.
In any case, the performance of earned value management is usually based on 
performance metrics at given time milestones. Because the value and time perfor-
mance of a project will be 1 by the end no matter how you measure it, these mea-
surements are taken at intervals chosen before the investment is made. It’s 
common to measure the investment’s performance at, for example, 10 percent 
repayment period, 50 percent repayment period, 50 percent asset lifespan, or any 
other intervals, usually measuring multiple times over a given duration.
Budget metrics
In this section, everything in this chapter comes around full-circle and takes you 
back to budgeting. I told you it would all make sense by the end. When it comes to 
allocating resources toward an investment to derive value from it (you can’t just buy 
a machine without allocating resources to the operation, maintenance, and financ-
ing of that machine), the corporation must develop a budget for that investment. 
Because so much money and so many resources are being spent to generate a return 
on investment, ensuring that the investment is adhering to its budget is a big part 
of how successful executive management will consider the investment to be. I guar-
antee it. Of course, the performance of an investment will also come through in the 
updated calculations of the MIRR over time, but some additional calculations are 
frequently performed in EVM that are concerned specifically with budgetary issues, 
in order to identify why deviations in the MIRR over time might occur.
Cost variance
The amount of value that a corporation can derive from an investment at a given 
cost is a large concern for a corporation. No one likes to continuously throw funds 
down a “money pit.” So, reaching the anticipated 100 percent value from your 
investment on-budget is preferred. If some variation exists, it’s calculated like this:
CV
EV
AC
where the cost variance (CV) is equal to the earned value (EV) less the actual cost 
(AC). Spending more money to generate value at given milestones throughout a 
project is a bad thing. You may have to reevaluate whether continuing to pursue 
the investment’s value is worth the additional costs. If the actual cost is lower for 
a given point in earned value, you should start planning how to use the surplus 
budgetary funding.

140      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Cost performance
As with time schedule metrics, another way to look at cost measurements is 
through a ratio. This time it’s called the cost performance (CP) ratio, and it’s meas-
ured like this:
CP
EV
AC
/
This ratio measures the earned value at a given point to the actual cost (AC) at that 
point.
Estimate at completion
The total cost of the capital investment at its completion is measured using a 
simple equation called estimate at completion (EAC):
EAC
BAC CP
/
where
BAC = Budget at completion
CP = Cost performance
So, the planned budget for the entire project is divided by the cost performance of 
the investment when the calculation is being done (in order to use the most recent 
data available). By doing this, you get a dollar value answer that tells you how 
much the investment actually costs compared to how much you planned on it 
costing. Here’s a quick example:
EAC
 you are 
 over budget
$
,
/ .
$
,
;
$ ,
.
10 000 1 2
12 000
2 000
That $2,000 is called the estimate to complete (ETC). As with everything else, 
there’s a formal calculation for this:
ETC
EAC
AC
Just like you did in the preceding example, you subtract the actual costs from the 
estimated cost at completion to see how much cost you have left to finish the 
project.
Whether the investment is worth pursuing after it has already begun going over 
budget depends on whether the ETC is lower than the potential present value of 
future cash flows, calculated as such:
Efficacy of investment
NPV
ETC
If the ETC surpasses the net present value (NPV) of future cash flows, you are just 
throwing money away by continuing the project.

CHAPTER 10  Calling in the Cavalry      141
To-complete performance
Whether a corporation can improve the financial efficiency of an investment to 
make that investment worth pursuing is calculated using the to-complete perfor-
mance (TCP):
TCP
BAC
EV
BAC
AC
/
You subtract the earned value (EV) from the budget at completion (BAC) and divide 
the result by the BAC less the actual cost (AC). This ratio tells the corporation by 
what percentage it needs to increase its performance efficiency. So, for example, 
if the TCP on a corporation’s project is 1.10, it needs to improve efficiency by  
10 percent in order to get the project back on track to be completed on-budget.

onds are popular among both corporations and investors. Corporations 
appreciate the fact that bonds don’t dilute the value of equity the way issu-
ing additional shares of stock does. And investors feel they’re less volatile 
than stocks with guaranteed returns. Still, most bonds have a fixed return, mak-
ing them particularly attractive for investors seeking stability, such as those who 
are funding retirement accounts.
In this chapter, you explore the different types of bonds available and their vari-
ous issuing institutions. You also discover the differences between fixed- and 
floating-rate bonds. I show you how to read about bonds and keep up on changes 
in bond valuations. Finally, a beginner’s guide to estimating the valuation and 
pricing of bonds helps you determine your corporation’s potential for raising 
money through debt and whether a particular bond is an attractive investment for 
your portfolio.
Exploring the Different Types of Bonds
A wide variety of different types of bonds are available, each with a variety of traits 
that make them unique, depending on who issued them. Each issuer can also offer 
different options for additional features on those bonds. Issuers can use different 
underlying assets to generate the returns earned on the bonds or change the 
methods by which repayments are made. A number of different permutations can

exist among bonds; for instance, a corporate bond may be a zero-coupon, con-
vertible bond. Additionally, a number of features are unique to each type of bond; 
for example, municipal bonds are the only ones that are frequently tax-exempt. 
However, bonds can’t have more than one issuer, nor can they have conflicting 
features (for example, a bond can’t be both coupon and zero-coupon).
Although all this variety can be great for both corporations and investors, each 
looking for just the right types of bonds for their own purposes, understanding 
the different options available takes a little more effort than, say, picking out a 
brand of freezer bags.
Considering corporate bonds
Corporate bonds are the ones that corporations issue to raise capital with debt. Pay 
extra special attention to corporate bonds, because these bonds are particularly 
important for corporate finance purposes. Nothing is particularly special about 
these bonds except, perhaps, the performance metrics used to evaluate the risk 
associated with investing in this debt. Nevertheless, the role of these bonds is of 
particular importance from the perspective of not only the investors (which are 
quite frequently corporations) but also the issuers (only corporations issue corpo-
rate bonds).
Gauging government bonds
Corporations aren’t the only organizations that issue bonds. Governments are 
some of the biggest and most popular issuers of bonds in the world. Like all other 
organizations, governments issue bonds to incur debt that funds spending. Every 
year the government budgets its revenues and expenditures, and when it spends 
more than it generates in revenues, the remainder must be acquired by incurring 
debt through the selling of government bonds.
In some cases, bonds are issued to fund a specific project rather than to make up 
for a general spending deficit. If a government wants to build a power plant, for 
example, rather than attempting to budget for it out of its usual revenues, it may 
just fund the entire project by selling bonds and paying them back from the profits 
generated by selling the energy. Again, that’s just one example.
The following sections take a quick look at some of the specific types of govern-
ment bonds.

CHAPTER 11  Bonding Over Business      145
Treasury bonds
Treasury bonds (T-bonds) are forms of government debt that mature in 1 to  
30 years. A mature bond is one that has reached the date upon which the borrower 
must repay the full amount of the bond plus interest to the investor. Treasury 
bonds are very long-term bonds and have the highest amount of interest rate risk, 
but they’re also very easy to trade, making them a popular option for investors.
In the United States, there are several types of treasury bonds, often listed as dif-
ferent “series”:
»
» Standard T-bonds make coupon interest payments every six months and are 
highly liquid, making them easily tradable.
»
» Series I bonds are nontraded savings bonds ranging in value from $25 to 
$5,000 each. They generate returns based on the fixed interest rate and the 
inflation rate over the time of issue.
»
» Series EE bonds range in value from $25 to $10,000 and offer a fixed interest 
rate return.
Some bonds continue to pay interest after maturity if they’re not withdrawn.
TREASURY NOTES
Treasury notes are shorter term than treasury bonds, lasting from two to ten years 
and are worth $100 to $5 million, in $100 increments. They tend to vary substan-
tially in interest rates and can be sold at a price other than face value, depending 
on the demand for a particular note.
As with T-bonds, and T-bills (see the next section), T-notes are purchased online 
from the U.S. treasury at www.treasurydirect.gov. Just register with the trea-
sury, wait for them to send you information in the mail, and then go back online 
to start purchasing treasury investments.
TREASURY BILLS
Treasury bills (T-bills) have a shorter maturity than any other treasury invest-
ment. They mature in less than one year, tend to have very low annual returns, 
and have a face value starting at $100. They’re sold at a discount of their face value 
and generate the full face value at maturity.
Treasury bills are particularly interesting and very influential investments for 
corporations and investors alike, because T-bills, and other very short-term 
fixed-rate debt investments made by economically stable governments, are 

146      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
considered risk-free. When someone mentions a risk-free investment, chances 
are they are referring to T-bills. T-bills are considered risk-free for two reasons:
»
» They mature quickly enough to avoid being highly subject to interest rate risk.
»
» The issuing government has an extremely low risk of default on T-bills (or 
whatever the respective product is called in nations other than the United 
States).
As a result, the potential rate of return on T-bills defines the standard by which 
all other investments are judged; an investment that carries a higher risk than 
T-bills must also generate greater financial returns than T-bills. For corporations 
issuing corporate bonds, the degree of risk associated with a particular bond must 
be associated with a higher interest rate than that offered by T-bills. I go into this 
subject in a lot more detail in Chapters 15 and 16.
TREASURY TIPS
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a special type of treasury 
bond that adjusts for inflation. The principal value on TIPS is variable and is 
pegged to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most common measure of con-
sumer inflation. TIPS are designed to generate a real return on investment just 
like normal bonds, providing interest payments twice a year, but they also protect 
investors against inflation risk.
TREASURY STRIPS
Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities, or STRIPS, are 
much less complicated than their name implies. All it means is that the treasury 
bond has been financially engineered to separate interest payments and repay-
ment of the principal. In other words, a standard treasury bond generates interest 
payments every six months and also repays the principal at maturity. STRIPS 
actually separate these cash flows so that you can invest in just the interest pay-
ments or just the principal repayment, turning one bond into two quasi-bond 
STRIPS.
Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds are bonds issued not by the federal government, but by smaller 
governments, such as the government of a state, county, city, or municipality 
(hence, the name “municipal bond”). Municipal bonds come in two flavors:
»
» General obligation bonds work in a manner similar to T-bonds in that they 
provide capital for the government and are repaid using the government’s 
ability to generate revenues through taxation and fees.

CHAPTER 11  Bonding Over Business      147
»
» Revenue bonds raise funds for a specific project that is expected to generate 
revenues. The bonds are repaid using the revenues generated by that project. 
Utilities infrastructure, toll roads/bridges, and other such large, revenue- 
generating projects are typically the sort of things funded by revenue bonds.
What makes municipal bonds so special, however, is that many of them are 
tax-exempt. Whereas any financial returns on investment that you make on the 
majority of bonds is taxed at both the federal and local levels, many municipal 
bonds are exempt from any form of taxation for the majority of people. Therefore, 
the money you make on these bonds frequently, but not always, exceeds the 
potential for post-tax revenues from other bonds. As always, make sure you 
research any bond before investing to make sure that the bond really is what you 
think it is.
Clipping coupon bonds
The term coupon bond comes from the old days when bonds were physical pieces 
of paper. These bonds had a series of paper tickets attached to them, each matur-
ing at a specific date in the future. Each coupon represented an interest payment, 
and accumulated interest was paid periodically in exchange for the attached cou-
pons. Bonds aren’t typically physical pieces of paper anymore, but bonds that 
periodically make interest payments are still considered coupon bonds. Investors 
just don’t have to clip coupons!
In contrast to coupon bonds, zero-coupon bonds don’t make periodic interest 
payments; they have no coupons. They still generate income, but instead of mak-
ing periodic payments, everything is paid out at maturity. Zero-coupon bonds are 
sold at a deep discount and pay face value at maturity.
Backing up with assets
Though not technically a bond in the strictest sense, from a corporate finance 
perspective, asset-backed securities are nearly identical to municipal revenue bonds 
(except that they’re never tax-exempt). Asset-backed securities are securities sold 
by a corporation in order to raise capital for an investment (such as issuing bonds) 
and then the securities are repaid using the revenues raised from that investment.
For example, if a bank issues an asset-backed security, the money it raises from 
the sale can then be used to make a business loan to someone else. Whereas the 
asset-backed security may pay 5 percent to the investor, the returns are repaid 
using part of the 6 percent interest that the bank earns from the business loan.

148      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
In a typical business loan, if the business defaults on the loan, the lender owns 
whatever assets it can take or sell from the business. With an asset-backed secu-
rity, because the security is repaid using the cash flows from the business loan, if 
the business defaults, the assets of the business are sold and profits are used to 
repay the holders of the asset-backed securities first; then whatever is left over 
belongs to the bank.
Mortgage-backed securities are a special type of asset-backed security that’s 
backed by, yes, mortgages. A bank issues these to raise money in order to fund 
mortgage lending. They’re particularly noteworthy because, first, they’re the 
most common of all asset-backed securities. Second, and a bit more infamously, 
these mortgage-backed securities were a common way for banks holding large 
amounts of troubled subprime mortgages likely to default to distribute their fail-
ure to investors and other banks. This wasn’t always the case, but for a time lead-
ing up to 2007, it did happen quite a lot. They combined some of these subprime 
mortgages with normal mortgages to form a bundle of assets that, in turn, were 
used to form mortgage-backed securities. These securities were then sold, putting 
the risk of failure just as much in the hands of the holders of those securities as 
anyone else. Once the mortgages started going into default, everyone who touched 
that mortgage or the securities derived from that mortgage began losing value and 
money. This practice caused a chain reaction of failure stemming from the reck-
less lack of proper risk management in a few very large banks.
Converting bonds
Say that you’re not sure whether you want to buy bonds or stock. Sure, the bonds 
will generate more returns if the company’s stock drops, thus protecting your 
entire investment portfolio, but if the company does well, the stocks could easily 
outperform the bonds. Or, maybe what your corporation really wants to do is sell 
stock, but it’s afraid that issuing more shares of stock will make investors believe 
their own shares are overpriced. This perception may cause them to sell their 
shares, reducing the market price of all shares of your corporation’s stock and 
making the new shares worth less than you had hoped. In both cases, the answer 
to your problem can be found in the use of convertible bonds.
Convertible bonds work just like normal corporate bonds except the purchasers 
have the option, at their own discretion, to convert the bonds into a predeter-
mined number of shares of stock. If you’re the investor and the company starts 
doing very well, causing the stock price to increase, you can convert your bonds to 
the more valuable stock. But if the stock price drops, you’re still guaranteed 
returns from your bond purchase  — assuming you’re not foolish enough to 
exchange perfectly good bonds for failing stock.

CHAPTER 11  Bonding Over Business      149
As a corporate financial manager, issuing convertible bonds allows you to raise 
equity without reducing investor confidence in the price of your stock. You’re giv-
ing investors the option to exchange bonds for equity. Perhaps this isn’t the ideal 
situation for your capital structure, because in such instances, selling equity is the 
most desirable option, but it provides the best option possible in some cases where 
a straight IPO would be harmful.
Calling it in with callable bonds
Issuing bonds can be very expensive for a company. For every bond sold, the cor-
poration must pay back not only the principal but also interest. If market interest 
rates drop below the rates that a corporation is paying on existing bonds, it would 
be beneficial for the corporation to stop paying the rate on those bonds and issue 
new bonds at the lower rate, right? Wouldn’t that be nice? Well, it’s possible!
Callable bonds are bonds that are issued with a contractual clause that allows the 
issuing corporation to redeem the bonds before their maturity date at a price equal 
to the present value plus a premium. This premium, which is paid to the investor, 
acts like an early redemption penalty in order to fairly reimburse the investor for 
not extending the debt to its full maturity date.
Putting in the effort: puttable bonds
If your corporation is buying bonds, it may want to protect itself from a change in 
interest rates. Say that you’re buying bonds at a 5 percent interest rate and inter-
est rates go up to 10 percent. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could force the issuer to buy 
back your 5 percent bonds so you could use that money to buy 10 percent bonds? 
Well, that’s what puttable bonds allow you to do. When your corporation buys put-
table bonds and interest rates increase, you can insist on prematurity repayment 
of the principal, minus a penalty for early withdrawal. You can then use that 
money to buy higher-rate bonds.
For a corporation, using this strategy to attract investors can be particularly risky, 
though. If several of your investors exercise their “put option,” forcing your cor-
poration to repay its debts, and your corporation doesn’t have enough cash to 
repay them, it will have to sell the capital it bought using that debt to make repay-
ments. This scenario can lead to a situation called insolvency, where you simply 
don’t have the money to pay your debts and are forced out of business. This form 
of potential repayment obligation isn’t measured on the balance sheet, so it may 
make your corporation look like it has more liquid assets than it really does. 
Therefore, managers watching the company’s liquidity need to use financial data 
that adjusts for these sorts of puttable bonds when determining the company’s 
risk of insolvency or illiquidity.

Registering the bearer
The vast majority of all bonds in existence around the world today are registered 
bonds, which also includes the majority of bonds that fall into the categories dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter. Registered bonds don’t exist as physical entities. 
Instead, they’re electronically registered to individuals, and serial numbers con-
nect those bonds to those individuals as a means of tracking ownership. Some-
times a certificate representing ownership is issued, but even that’s not the norm, 
and exchanging it won’t actually change ownership. Nearly all bonds are exchanged 
electronically now.
Bearer bonds are old-school; they were primarily issued before the days of bond 
registration. Bearer bonds are bonds that are owned by whoever holds the physical 
paper bond. They’re a little like cash in that if someone steals them from you, the 
thief now owns the bonds. If you give them away, they become someone else’s as 
well. The only ownership associated with a bearer bond is the person who bears 
the bond. These bonds are rare nowadays.
Counting on forgiveness with  
catastrophe bonds
Catastrophe bonds are extremely rare but still worth noting because they play an 
interesting role as a method for both raising capital and diversifying operational 
risk. Catastrophe bonds are bonds that raise capital for companies to limit the risk 
of an event occurring. The corporation issues bonds to raise capital with the stip-
ulation that if a specific event occurs, bondholders must forgive repayment of the 
interest and/or principal. Any corporation can issue catastrophe bonds; they’re an 
alternative to buying insurance to limit the risk of a potential disaster.
For example, an insurance company may issue catastrophe bonds to raise money 
in case of an earthquake. If an earthquake doesn’t occur by the maturity date, the 
company pays the investors the principal with interest. The funds received from 
the sale of the bonds are usually reinvested by the insurance company to generate 
interest, which is then used for the bonds’ repayment. If an earthquake occurs, 
however, the insurance company instead uses the money from selling bonds to 
help pay the huge number of claims that result, and the investors give up their 
claims to any future cash flows on their investment. The bottom line is that if the 
disaster happens, the investment is voided.
Junking bad bonds
Junk bonds are infamous for being toilets down which you might flush large 
amounts of money with no hope for its return. Truth be told, this reputation is more 
the result of dishonest dealers than anything inherent in the bonds themselves.

CHAPTER 11  Bonding Over Business      151
Junk bonds are bonds that are issued by organizations that are at high risk for 
default, or have become high risk at some point after the issuance of the bonds 
(aka “fallen angels”). The upside of junk bonds is that they offer much higher 
earnings potential via large discount rates or interest rates. When used properly, 
as a speculative investment that supplements your total investment portfolio and 
comprises a very small proportion of your total investments, junk bonds can be 
beneficial.
The problem with junk bonds is that most people aren’t financially savvy enough 
to pursue them. If you’re reading this book to find out more about corporate 
finance, you’re probably not in a position to go near junk bonds on your own. See 
the sidebar “How junk bonds got their reputation” for more information.
Reviewing Bond Rates
Most of the bonds discussed in the previous section, except TIPS, are very fre-
quently fixed-rate bonds. However, they can also be found in floating-rate forms.
Fixed-rate bonds are pretty simple. If the bond says it pays 1 percent interest plus 
principal, then that’s exactly what you’re going to earn. There are no changes, no 
fluctuations, no nothing. The nominal cash flows of a fixed-rate bond are exactly 
as advertised: repayment of the principal with added interest payment equal to 
the percentage rate.
HOW JUNK BONDS GOT THEIR REPUTATION
What has really made junk bonds infamous is the way they’ve been marketed and sold. 
Bonds were very popular among individuals during and after World War II as a way to 
invest while supporting the war and reconstruction efforts. The bonds sold during this 
time were very low risk, giving people a high degree of trust in them. Fast-forward to the 
late 20th century, when junk bonds started regaining popularity. Many dealers began 
targeting retirees and others who had grown to trust the bonds of the Second World 
War era in order to sell these high-risk bonds without fully informing investors of the 
risk. When this deception came to the public’s attention, the reputation of junk bonds as 
something sinister became established. The reality is that they’re high risk, but they still 
have a proper place for many investors, while also giving small and startup companies a 
way to acquire capital.

152      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
A floating-rate bond, on the other hand, is one where either the interest rate or 
the principal payments are variable. So, the amount of money you make on invest-
ing in floating-rate bonds changes over the life of the bond. You may make  
1 percent one year, 100 percent the next year, and then 2 percent the year after 
that, depending on what the bond is pegged to. That’s how the returns on these 
bonds is determined: They’re tied to some other measure.
TIPS, which I detail earlier in this chapter, are one form of floating-rate bond. 
TIPS increase or decrease at the same rate as the CPI. Similarly, other floating-
rate bonds change in value with a number of other potential measures. Here are a 
few more common types of floating-rate bonds:
»
» Interest rate float: The simple interest rate float is easily the most common 
form of floating-rate bond. The interest rate on these bonds floats with the 
market interest rate. If the interest rate offered on bonds for sale on the open 
market increases, the bond pays more, matching the market interest rate. On 
the other hand, if the market rate decreases, so do the returns on your 
floating-rate bond.
These bonds are good options for attracting investors speculating on interest 
rate increases, while benefiting issuing corporations when market interest 
rates decrease.
»
» Inverse interest rate float: Inverse interest rate floats are bonds that offer 
returns that are the opposite of the market interest rate. They work just like 
standard interest rate bonds, except they go in the opposite direction. When 
the market rate goes down, the rate on these bonds goes up, and vice versa. 
Investors like these bonds when interest rates are projected to decrease, and 
issuing corporations like them when interest rates are projected to go up. 
These bonds are also helpful for portfolio risk management, because they 
allow bond investors to buy equal amounts of opposite-direction floating-rate 
bonds (interest floats and inverse interest floats) to protect against all interest 
rate changes and help stabilize interest rate returns.
Many investors feel this strategy minimizes returns, though, because using 
your money to buy only the best investments, instead of using a portion for 
risk management, decreases potential. See Chapter 14 for a more detailed 
discussion of the relationship between risk and reward.
»
» Indexed bonds: Indexed bonds are floating-rate bonds whose interest rate 
is pegged to any of many available indexes. For example, if you buy or sell 
a bond pegged to the NASDAQ stock index and the NASDAQ increases by 
10 percent, your interest rate will also increase by 10 percent.

CHAPTER 11  Bonding Over Business      153
Be careful in the way you interpret these increases. If your NASDAQ-pegged 
bond starts out paying 1 percent and the NASDAQ increases by 10 percent, 
your bond won’t increase to 11 percent returns; it will increase to 1.1 percent 
returns. A 10 percent increase on 1 percent is an additional 0.1 percent.
Reading Bond Information
Knowing the different types of bonds available is only the first step toward under-
standing their potential impact on your corporation. Look in the finance portion 
of any newspaper or the finance page of any major website and you’ll see infor-
mation about the bond market. This data about specific bonds is meant to help 
buyers and sellers make effective decisions regarding the potential to invest in 
bonds or issue their own. The exact information provided depends a lot on the 
types of bonds being described.
Following is a list of common information about bonds that may improve your 
vocabulary a bit and make sure you know how to read bonds in the language of 
corporate finance:
»
» Ask: The ask price is the price at which the seller is attempting to sell the 
bond. If this amount is above the bid price, no sale will be made until the 
buyer and seller give in and accept the price of the other party; the difference 
is called the spread.
»
» Bid: The bid is the price at which the buyer is attempting to buy a particular 
bond. If this is below the ask price, no sale will be made until the buyer and 
seller agree on a compromise; the difference is called the spread.
»
» Coupon/rate: The terms coupon and rate refer to the interest rate generated 
on a bond. This interest rate is expressed as a percentage with up to three 
decimal places.
»
» Credit quality ratings: When bonds are issued, the issuers are asking others 
to loan them money through the purchase of the bond. Just as any individual 
getting a mortgage or credit card must undergo a credit assessment, so too 
must corporations issuing bonds. The credit quality rating on a bond is 
performed by a credit rating agency, and the rating is then provided to the 
public in order to help prospective buyers assess the risk of the issuing 
corporation defaulting. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s are the two 
primary rating agencies. Each uses a slightly different rating system, but their 
purpose is generally the same. Table 11-1 lists their ratings from highest to 
lowest and explains what they mean.

154      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
»
» Face value/par value: The face value or par value is the amount of the 
principal repayment on the bond. If this value isn’t listed, you can pretty much 
assume that it’s $1,000 per bond. Nevertheless, before taking any action, be 
sure to confirm the value because variations do exist and range a great deal.
»
» Issuer: The issuer is the organization that is issuing the bond.
»
» Maturity/maturity date: The maturity or maturity date can be listed in one of 
two ways: either as a duration of time (for example, one year, ten years, and 
so forth) or as a date (for example, Nov. 2012; Feb. 15, 2019; and so on). In the 
case of the former, the bond matures in an exact duration of time after the 
purchase date. In the case of the latter, the bond matures on the date listed.
»
» Price: Where a lot of people start to get confused with bonds is when they 
start talking about price, yield, and the relationship between them. The reason 
for this is that price isn’t just listed as the nominal face value of the bond; it’s 
actually listed as a percentage of the face value. So, if a bond is listed at 
100.00, it’s selling at the exact face value of the bond. If the bond is selling 
below face value, say, at 99.95, then it’s selling at 99.95 percent of the face 
value. If the price is 101.01, it’s selling at 101.01 percent of the face value.
A bond that sells for under face value is selling at a discount, whereas a bond 
selling above face value is selling at a premium. In the end, the principal 
repayment is still going to be the face value of the bond, but the bond itself 
can sell for higher or lower than the principal repayment. Why do people do

this? Interest payments! Even if the interest on a bond is well below market 
rates, a bond can still be attractive if it’s sold at a heavy discount. If a bond is 
sold at a premium price, it can still be attractive if it has high interest rates.
Bond pricing can also be considered dirty or clean. The dirty price is the bond 
price including accrued interest, whereas the clean price accounts for just the 
price and not any accrued interest. The prices listed in most major outlets are 
clean prices.
»
» Price change: Price change refers only to the amount the price has changed 
since the last period, which can be anywhere from one day to one year, 
depending on where you’re getting your information. It can be expressed in 
two ways:
In nominal terms, the price change is expressed in terms of the dollar 
increase or decrease.
In ratio terms, the price change is expressed as a percentage of the 
previously reported price.
»
» Volume: This term describes the volume of a particular bond being 
exchanged. Rather than providing information about the value of any 
particular bond, the volume describes the total value of all bonds of a particu-
lar type being sold. So if someone were to issue and successfully sell ten 
bonds worth $10 each, the volume would be $100 during that time period. In 
the next period, if only one person who bought that bond were to resell the 
bond, the volume would drop to $10.
»
» Yield: Yield refers to the amount of returns that a bond generates at a given 
price. That’s why yield is related to price — because the amount of returns on 
a particular bond that an investor generates depends on the relationship 
between price and yield. If a one-year bond yields $100 per year and the 
market price of the bond was $100, then the yield is $0 or 0 percent. On the 
other hand, if the price was only $50, the yield is $50 or 100 percent. Yield, 
also known as current yield, refers specifically to the annual amount of interest 
paid divided by the market price of the bond (which is then multiplied by 100 
to make it a percentage). This annual yield differs from yield to maturity, 
which is the total amount of returns generated by holding the bond to 
maturity rather than over the course of a single year.
»
» Yield change: This term refers only to the amount the yield has changed since 
the last period, which can be anywhere from one day to one year, depending 
on where you’re getting your information. It can be expressed in two ways:
In nominal terms, the yield change is expressed in terms of the dollar 
increase or decrease.
In ratio terms, the yield change is expressed as a percentage of the 
previously reported price.

156      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
»
» Yield to maturity: Yield to maturity (YTM) is the value of the returns on a bond 
if the bond is held until its maturity date, given the current price. Of course if 
the price is higher, the yield will be lower because the percentage returns on 
the investment will be a lower proportion of the price. Conversely, the yield 
will be higher if the price is lower. YTM assumes not only that the bond is held 
to maturity but also that no coupons are collected, which allows all coupons to 
continue accruing interest until the maturity date.
Understanding Bond Valuation
The valuation of bonds refers to the process by which you determine the value of a 
bond. This information is then used, in conjunction with your personal estimates 
of what you’re willing to pay or your other options, to determine what is consid-
ered a fair price. For investors, these valuation methods are the manner in which 
the investor will figure out what they’re willing to pay, what they can expect in 
returns, and what their investment portfolio is worth at any given point in time. 
For the issuing organizations, these valuation methods allow them to determine 
how much capital they can raise using debt, and the interest rates they will have 
to offer in order to attract investors. You will do this using math!

r stands for “rate,” which is the annual interest rate, and t is the number of years 
that the single cash flow, so all this equation says is that you need to add up the 
present values of all the coupons, then also add the present value of the end prin-
cipal payment, and that gives you the total present value of the bond. (If you’re 
not familiar with present value, see Chapter 9.) That thing at the front that looks 
like a giant “E” is called a sigma. All it means is that you’re adding the values of 
different things together; in this case, the different present values of future cou-
pon cash flows for each year.
The comforting part of understanding this equation is that even the more compli-
cated equations are really just variations that build on this same theme using 
additional variables and information to refine it and make it more accurate.
Zero-coupon bonds, principal STRIPS, and other bonds that don’t make periodic 
interest payments don’t have this sort of calculation. Instead, because they gen-
erate all their cash flows at maturity, the bond value is equal to the present value 
of the single future cash flow after accounting for accumulated interest. Just look 
at them with the present value of its maturity date, rather than including any cou-
pon payments.

CHAPTER 11  Bonding Over Business      157
If you’re not holding a bond to maturity, or you want to calculate your percentage 
return on bond investment, you can do so by calculating the holding period yield. 
This is the amount of yield that a bond will provide while a person is holding it, 
which pretty much assumes that the person is selling the bond before maturity — 
but some people just really like math.
Holding period yield

In this case, the net gain or loss is the price of selling the bond minus the price of 
purchasing the bond, meaning that it’s the profits generated from buying and 
reselling the bond. Add any coupon payments you received during the holding 
period, and you’ve just calculated what the bond is worth over a holding period 
rather than to maturity. Of course, this does assume you can accurately estimate 
the price you can sell the bond for, which is a pretty big assumption for some 
people. Take the value of that bond and divide it by your purchase price to show 
your return on investment as a proportion; multiply it by 100 to calculate it as a 
percentage.

Savvy Stock Sales
I
t’s no surprise that the stock market is so often compared to gambling, when so 
many who participate merely think they can beat the odds. They buy or sell 
looking only at the ever-changing probability of getting a win, rather than at 
the underlying value of the transactions. This madness, even among those who 
claim to be rational, is typically what drives the short-run movements in the mar-
ket. This game of chance isn’t for everyone, and there’s no reason to play it when 
the long-run valuations are much more stable, predictable, and reasonably free of 
all the complicated nonsense that traders spend their time on.
Exchanging Stocks
Exchanges take place by different methods that facilitate the purchase and sale of 
equities between two or more people who otherwise have no other way of contact-
ing each other. Exchanges are made through three primary methods, each consid-
ered to be a separate market for stocks:
»
» Stock exchanges: The most commonly recognized medium for the exchange 
of stocks is, as you may guess, the stock exchange. These large, centralized 
exchanges are usually located in big rooms within buildings in major cities

around the world, where brokers, dealers, broker-dealers, and others involved 
in the exchange of stock congregate. The exchanges themselves offer a 
number of services, including the use of electronic communication networks 
(ECNs) to facilitate trades.
»
» ECNs: Electronic communication networks are computer networks that link 
traders, brokers, dealers, and even stock exchanges in order to facilitate the 
trade of equities. These are now the dominant method by which stocks are 
bought and sold.
»
» OTC markets: Over-the-counter (OTC) markets are a less popular method of 
exchanging stocks, but they often include access to stocks that aren’t available 
any other way. Over-the-counter markets include any other system that 
facilitates the trade in equities. These are usually networks of brokers and 
dealers communicating outside exchanges. Over-the-counter stocks include, 
obviously, those corporations not listed on major exchanges. As a result, they 
experience far less volume and don’t tend to attract as many investors. 
Information about these stocks is often distributed in updated papers called 
pink sheets. These stocks can be easily identified because their ticker symbols 
end in .pk.
If you’re not familiar with the different types of stock, check out Chapter 3.
Looking at the Different Types of Orders
After you decide that you want to buy or sell stock, you have to decide the type of 
buy or sell order you want to place, the price at which you want the transaction to 
take place, and the timing of the transaction. These factors can all be controlled by 
managing your transaction order. By order, I’m not referring to putting things into 
a proper sequence, such as putting people in order by height. Instead, I’m refer-
ring to the type of order that you give the bartender at your favorite bar.
Say that you want to buy 10 shares of Ford stock for $10 per share, and you want 
the transaction to take place as soon as a seller of that many shares at that price 
becomes available. Basically, all you do is give that order to your broker or set it up 
online using your brokerage account. Whether your order is fulfilled depends on 
whether a seller can be found who’s willing to sell 10 shares for $10 per share.
That brings up a very quick point: the mechanism by which the price of equities is 
set. Pricing is performed in a sort of dual-auction system, where potential buyers 
and sellers negotiate back and forth on price until a price is established that allows 
a transaction to take place. This compromise is found through fluctuations in the 
bid and ask prices of the stock:

CHAPTER 12  Savvy Stock Sales      161
»
» The ask price of a stock is the price that the people who own the stock are 
willing to sell it for. When the owner of a stock wants to sell their shares, they 
must ask for a price that buyers are willing to pay, or they won’t be able to sell 
their shares.
»
» The bid price is the price that buyers are willing to pay to purchase shares of 
a stock. The buyer must pay a price that sellers are willing to sell their shares 
for, or they won’t be able to buy those shares.
»
» The spread is the difference between the ask and bid prices.
The price of a stock is established when two people find a compromise in the spread 
whereby the buyer is willing to pay a particular price and the seller is willing to 
accept that price. The price of a stock increases when buyers are willing to compro-
mise more, paying the ask price or even more. The price of a stock decreases when 
the sellers are willing to compromise more, accepting the bid price or even less.
The different types of orders available are meant to manage the interaction 
between the bid price, the ask price, and the spread. They do this by allowing the 
investor to determine when and at what price the transactions will take place, if 
at all. The following sections describe a few of these types of orders.
One thing to note about all orders is that you have the option to do fill-or-kill 
orders. In this case, your order states that for the exchange to be executed, the 
exchange must be for the entirety of your order, not just a portion of it. For those 
times when having your order filled in its entirety doesn’t matter, you have the 
option to allow a transaction to fulfill a portion of your order while the remaining 
portion is left to be fulfilled in another transaction, if at all.
Market order
Easily the simplest type of order for the purchase or sale of equity is the market 
order. In a market order, the investor simply accepts the price set by the other side 
of the transaction. If the person setting the market order is a buyer, the price 
established automatically becomes the ask price, and the exchange happens nearly 
instantly because the buyer isn’t waiting for the seller to come down in price. If 
the person setting the market order is the seller, the price automatically becomes 
the bid price, and that exchange, too, occurs almost instantly.
Stop and limit orders
That stop and limit orders are even differentiated from each other is really just 
silly, because the distinction has more to do with the motivation of the traders 
rather than the actual mechanism of the order. For now, I treat them as the same 
thing, but I briefly explain the difference at the end of this section.

162      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Stop and limit orders are used to manage the price at which a transaction takes 
place. For instance, an investor may want to place an order whereby shares are not 
purchased until prices either drop below or rise above a certain level. Once the 
trigger that the order is dependent on occurs, it automatically takes place assum-
ing a partner to the exchange is available at a given price. The same can apply to 
selling shares: Someone may place an order to sell a specified number of shares 
only if and when the price of the stock increases or decreases by a predetermined 
amount.
The motivation behind this strategy depends on the order and the price. If some-
one sets an order to sell shares once they drop below a certain price, they are likely 
attempting to limit their potential losses from the price going too low. If someone 
wants to sell shares after the price increases, they likely have a strategy in mind 
that involves walking away with the revenues from the sale. If an investor wants 
to purchase shares after they drop below a specified price, they likely believe that 
this particular price would be a good deal and that the price will rebound upward. 
If they want to purchase shares after the price increases past a certain point, they 
may be waiting for the rebound on the stock price to have already begun, to ensure 
that the company isn’t simply performing poorly in the market.
The price that the order is set at isn’t necessarily the price at which the transac-
tion takes place. Because these types of orders are typically “at price or higher” or 
“at price or lower,” market gaps can occur that cause the transaction to occur at a 
price that surpasses the milestone price. For example, say that someone owns 
shares priced at $15 per share and wants to sell those shares when they hit a price 
of $10 per share or lower in order to help limit risk. If suddenly no one is willing 
to pay even $10 per share, causing a gap in the spread, the order will occur at the 
next transaction price, even if that’s below $10 per share.
If these orders are all basically the same thing anyway, why do we differentiate 
between stop orders and limit orders? Really, it’s all about motivation. A stop 
order is an order to sell shares once they drop below a certain price, stopping the 
amount of potential loss that may be experienced. Limit orders are orders to pur-
chase shares once they drop below a certain price or to sell shares once they exceed 
the trigger price. Stop and loss orders are really all the same thing, though, and 
are treated as such in computer-automated trading.
Pegged order
A pegged order is a bit like a stop or limit order in that the exchange doesn’t take 
place until the trigger price is reached, but that trigger price changes along with 
the value of some other variable, such as an index or economic metric. Once that 
variable reaches a particular value, the peg fluctuations stop, and the order is set.

CHAPTER 12  Savvy Stock Sales      163
Time-contingent order
An order may be contingent on time. Some orders are delayed for a predetermined 
period of time before they’re entered into the market. Other orders are cancelled 
if they’re not fulfilled before a certain period of time. For example, day orders are 
time-contingent orders because they’re cancelled at the end of the trading day if 
they’re not filled by then.
Comparing Long and Short Stocks
The terms long and short, in the context of equities trading, tend to remain a 
mystery for a large number of people. After all, stocks are always the same, right? 
That’s actually true: Whether you’re buying long or selling short doesn’t change 
the stock itself; it just changes the nature of whether you’re in possession of that 
stock and the periods of time that you’re in possession of it. This section also dis-
cusses the use of margin accounts, which allow you to buy stock without being in 
possession of the funds to do so. Put simply, it’s just borrowing money to buy 
stocks, but the mechanics are similar to short-selling.
Buying long
When people think about buying stock, the majority of the time they’re thinking 
about buying long. Buying long means you own the stock you’re buying immedi-
ately once the transaction has taken place, and you continue to own that stock 
until you sell it. People buy long with the intent of keeping the stock for at least a 
short period of time  — perhaps for a few minutes or perhaps for as long as  
possible — before eventually reselling it. The exact length of time that you own 
the stock doesn’t impact whether the position is considered short or long. When 
people buy long, they believe that the value of the stock will increase while it’s in 
their possession. So, they buy the stock, allow its value to appreciate, and then sell 
it when the value is high enough. Buy, own, sell — pretty simple, right? There’s 
not much more to it.
Buying long theoretically has limited loss potential but unlimited gain potential. 
When you buy a stock for $10, the worst thing that can happen is the company 
goes out of business and you lose all $10. On the other hand, that $10 could, in 
theory, increase in value by an unlimited amount. Of course, reality must set in 
when you realize that the chances of it increasing even a moderate amount are 
volatile, leaving you with significant risk of loss. In other words, the potential is 
there, but the reality is often far less glamorous, usually somewhere well within 
the range of –10 percent to +10 percent annual change.

There’s no such thing as selling long; once you sell the stock, it’s no longer yours.
Buying on margin
When you purchase stock on margin, it means that you’ve borrowed money to buy 
stock. This usually involves opening a margin account with your stockbroker, 
wherein the broker or an associated financial institution lends you money, usually 
with relatively low interest rates, in order to buy stock. Typically, buying on mar-
gin involves maintaining a minimum balance in the account (or in a related 
account) as collateral in case you screw the pooch.
Investors are advised to be very, very careful when buying on margin, because 
stock investing tends to yield volatile and risky returns anyway, whereas the 
interest you’ll have to pay by borrowing on margin is a guaranteed thing. Buying 
on margin limits potential gains while exacerbating any potential losses because 
you have to pay interest on the borrowed funds.
Selling short
Just like there’s no selling long, there’s also no buying short. Instead, selling short, 
or short-selling, means that you’re selling stocks not currently in your possession 
to someone else with the obligation to purchase that stock from them at a later 
date. People sell short when they believe the value of the stock is going to decrease. 
They’re able to make money when the stock does poorly by short-selling. It works 
like this: The investor borrows X shares of a single company’s stock from a broker 
and sells them to someone for the revenue. Usually this is done using a margin 
account, whereby the investor must maintain other assets as collateral for the 
loan. At some point in the future, the investor must purchase the name number of 
shares of stock and return them to the broker.
If the price of the stock goes down during the period that the investor shorted the 
stock, then when they repurchase the stock, they pay less than they earned from 
the sale. This scenario generates a profit. If the value of the stock increases during 
the shorted period, then the investor must pay more to repurchase it than they 
generated in revenue from the sale, meaning they lose money. Short-selling is 
one method that investors use to generate income and returns even when invest-
ments are performing poorly. (Another is raising income by selling derivatives, 
but I talk about that in Chapter 13.)
Short-selling can be extremely risky. When you sell a stock and are obligated to 
rebuy it, the potential for financial loss is unlimited. Consider the following two 
examples, both of which involve a pet hamster trained to be a stock trader:

CHAPTER 12  Savvy Stock Sales      165
»
» Skippy the hamster short-sells ten shares of ABC stock for $10 each. The 
company does very poorly and goes out of business. Because the company 
no longer has stock to repurchase, Skippy gets to keep all $100 from the short 
sale and doesn’t have to pay anyone to repurchase the stock. He uses the 
money to put an addition on his Habitrail home. Go Skippy!
»
» Skippy the hamster short-sells ten shares of ABC stock for $10 each. The company 
does amazingly well, and the price of the shares increases to $10 million each, 
leaving him owing nearly $100 million: The difference between his initial $100 
revenues (10 shares x $10 per share) and the $100 million it costs him to repur-
chase those shares (10 shares x $10 million per share) is $99,999,900. Skippy is 
found dead the next morning by the plumber unclogging the toilet. Poor Skippy!
Defining Caps and Sectors
A single company can be classified in several different ways. For example, Bank of 
America would be a blue-chip stock, a large cap company, and in the financial 
sector. So, each term represents a classification of several different companies 
grouped together by similar traits. It’s prudent to get the “chip” classification out 
of the way, as really only “blue-chip” companies are consistently referred to in 
this way. They are large and highly-valued corporations that can easily withstand 
market fluctuations. The term “blue chip” refers to the game Poker and the high 
value of the blue chips within the game.
Caps
A corporation’s “cap” refers to its market capitalization, which is the total market 
value of all outstanding shares of stock. Corporations are categorized by their total 
value into five primary categories:
»
» Large cap: Have total market capitalization of $10 billion or more
»
» Mid cap: Have total market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion
»
» Small cap: Have total market capitalization of less than $2 billion
»
» Micro cap: Have total market capitalization between $50 million and $200 
million
»
» Nano cap: Have total market capitalization of less than $50 million

166      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Market capitalization is a very easy thing to calculate. All you do is multiply the 
number of shares outstanding by the market price per share. So, if a corporation 
has 100 million shares outstanding and each share sells for $20, then the calcula-
tion looks like this: 100,000,000 × $20 = $2 billion. In this example, the corpora-
tion would be a mid cap stock.
The market capitalization for corporations is very closely watched because it’s 
often used as a quick reference point for the amount of potential risk and return 
associated with a corporation. The larger a corporation’s market capitalization, 
the more likely it is to be viewed as a lower-risk stock that will sustain its value 
and even possibly pay dividends, although it will never be a fast-growing stock. 
Smaller market cap companies tend to be higher risk and are less likely to pay 
dividends, but also have greater potential for fast growth.
Another quasi-classification of market capitalization is the penny stock. There’s no 
single definition for what classifies a penny stock. Depending on who you talk to, 
it’s either a stock that sells for less than one penny per share, a stock that sells for 
less than one dollar per share, a stock that sells for less than five dollars per share, 
any company in the micro or nano cap range, or any stock that’s not traded on a 
major exchange.That being said, penny stocks tend to be the smallest, most vola-
tile, and riskiest of all stocks. They’re very attractive to some people because 
penny stocks also have the most potential for growth, in those extremely rare 
instances when one actually succeeds. These stocks also tend to be very volatile, 
changing in value by several hundred or thousand percent in a single day, giving 
them some potential for people attempting to take advantage of interval trading 
(see Chapter 16 for more on this topic).
Sectors
The sector in which a corporation operates refers to its primary industry. Different 
sectors respond differently to external economic conditions, seasonal trends, and 
other variables, so knowing which sector a corporation operates in, as well as the 
variables that influence the price and performance of the corporations within that 
sector, can be helpful. Here’s a list of some of the most commonly cited sectors, 
with examples of the products or services available from that sector:
»
» Automotive: Vehicles
»
» Consumer discretionary: Sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll (fashion, booze, media, 
and so on)
»
» Consumer staples: Soups, soaps, cereals, and so forth
»
» Energy: Petroleum, biofuels, wind power, solar power, nuclear power, coal, 
and so on

Raging Bulls and Grizzly Bears
Exactly why the terms “bear” and “bull” were chosen has been lost to the ages, 
but using these terms in the context of stock markets dates back to at least 1714, 
according to the Oxford English Dictionary.
The terms each have several different usages and variations, but all have the same 
basic idea:
»
» A bull market means that the stock market is increasing in value.
»
» A bear market means the stock market is decreasing in value.
There is no single, definitive criteria for how much the stock market must change 
in value, either in appreciation or depreciation, but the insinuation is that the 
change in value is significant enough to warrant that investors consider altering 
their investing strategy as a result. That discounts any temporary changes in value 
or market shocks that will rebound quickly.
The stock market as a whole isn’t the only thing that can be bull or bear. Individ-
ual stocks can be a bull or a bear, meaning that the individual stock is expected to 
increase or decrease, respectively, in value. The term can also be applied to indi-
vidual people. If you believe that a stock or the stock market is going to increase 
in value, you are said to be bullish. If you believe there will be a depreciation in 
value, you are said to be bearish. For example, I might say that I’m bullish on tech 
stocks, which would mean that I believe that tech stocks are going to increase in 
value. I could also say, “I’m bullish on tech, but Asus is a bear,” which would 
mean that I think tech stocks will increase in value except for the company Asus, 
which I think will decrease in value.

168      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
I’m not saying that tech stocks will increase or that Asus will decrease. These are 
just examples of how the terminology is used. If you make actual investing deci-
sions based on examples from this book, you shouldn’t be allowed to touch your 
own money ever again.
Beating Stock Indices?
A stock index is not an actual thing, by itself. Instead, an index is an average that’s 
closely watched as investors attempt to use the information to get an idea of 
what’s happening in the overall stock market. Each index is typically calculated 
using some form of weighted average that takes several different corporations, 
weighs them using its preferred method, and then takes the market value of the 
weighted average measured by the prices of the underlying stocks. Each index 
uses its own method for calculating averages, different types of corporations, dif-
ferent sizes of corporations, different numbers of corporations, and so on.
For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is an average of 30 different 
corporations in the industrial sector. The S&P 500 is a composite of 500 different 
corporations chosen by Standard and Poor’s. The NASDAQ alone has 12 different 
indices, each focusing on a different sector or market capitalization. A wide num-
ber of other stock indices measure the value of stocks from different parts of the 
world: the Nikkei 225 is from Japan, the Hang Seng is from Hong Kong, and there 
are many, many more.
No index includes all the stocks from a particular nation. Instead, each attempts 
to provide an average idea of what the overall stock market is doing, as well as 
what individual categories of stocks are doing (broken down by sector, cap, and 
chip — see the earlier section “Defining Caps and Sectors”), by taking a sample 
and determining the average change in value.
Imagining the Value of Stocks
Easily the most difficult part of investing in stocks is figuring out what they’re 
worth and projecting how their prices will change. There are a number of different 
influences on the value and price of a stock. You can measure the stock itself using 
any of a number of equity valuation models.

CHAPTER 12  Savvy Stock Sales      169
Many people prefer to look at the individual company to assess its financial and 
competitive performance. Others look at the performance of entire sectors, and 
then simply choose one or more companies from a sector that appears to be doing 
well given the current economic conditions.
Many people, particularly traders, watch for fluctuations in the total stock market, 
hoping to generate earnings by taking advantage of intervals in price over time.
Finally, just about everyone watches the national economy and the macroeco-
nomic indicators that can help you understand how the economy is performing 
and at what point in the business cycle a nation is currently standing.
Surveying equity valuation models
Far too many different valuation models are in use to be able to talk about each 
one, many of which are becoming very involved due to the increased use of com-
puters and financial engineering. There are really only three primary categories of 
equity valuation models, though:
»
» Absolute models, sometimes called intrinsic models, look for the value of the 
company itself; seeking to find a measure that can capture the exact value of 
each company. These include such models as the following:
•	 The dividend discount model attempts to utilize the present discounted 
value of future dividends to value the price of a stock.
•	 The liquidation value is the total of the revenues that could be achieved 
from selling all corporate assets after paying back liabilities; used as a price 
floor for total market capitalization.
•	 The free cash flow method estimates cash flows to the firm and to 
equity, to estimate both fair price and growth rates.
»
» Relative models, sometimes called extrinsic models, intend to understand 
how the price or value of a company can be assessed by looking at variables 
that are influenced, at least in part, by things outside the corporation’s control, 
such as stock price, other corporations in the sector, and the performance of 
a corporation relative to economic and market performance ratios. Such 
ratios often include measures that involve comparisons to the sector, to the 
economy, or to stock price. Common values included in these models are 
earnings per share, the price to earnings ratio, and market responsiveness.
»
» Hybrid models tend to be more complex but only in the sense that they 
attempt to utilize methods employed by both absolute and relative models. 
Often, they attempt to find differentials in the intrinsic and extrinsic values.

170      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Checking out corporate analysis
Corporate analysis is one of the primary methods of determining the value of stock 
because the value of the underlying company contributes strongly to the value of 
the stock. Don’t be confused; the actual price of the stock is different from its 
value, and whether you prefer to watch the value of the company or the price of 
the stock will depend a lot on your investing strategy. High-frequency traders 
tend to watch stock prices more than the value of the underlying companies, 
whereas value investors, as you can probably guess, tend to watch the value of the 
underlying company because they’re looking for stable long-term performance.
A number of different methods are used to analyze corporate performance. Many 
of those methods are already included in this book; check out Chapters 4 through 8 
and 20. Despite advances in mathematics analytics, these methods are still among 
the most commonly used.
The nice thing about corporate performance is that even though a stock’s price 
may fluctuate wildly, both up and down from an average, often these fluctuations 
are related more to the behaviors of the stock market than to anything inherent in 
the stock or the company. So, by looking at the corporation rather than the stock, 
you can get an idea of whether the company itself has quality and value, and 
whether the stock appears to be priced too high or too low compared to the value 
of the company. In the long term (over the course of years), the price of a stock 
tends to float around the assessed value of the corporation, coming down eventu-
ally if it’s too high or getting recognized eventually if it’s a good bargain, driving 
prices back up again.
Evaluating industry performance
Each industry responds differently and at different times to different variables. 
Understanding how each sector responds to cycles and policies in the economy is 
very important for traders and investors alike. For example, during a recession, 
corporations that work in consumer staples (soups, soaps, cereals, and so forth) 
tend to see a boost in stock prices because demand for these things doesn’t 
decrease greatly. People will give up other, more discretionary goods in order to 
get the things they need. This is particularly true for corporations that offer cheap 
or discount consumer staples, such as Dollar Tree. As a result, you can begin to 
develop an understanding for how strongly each sector responds to changes in the 
economic cycle. When gross domestic product (GDP) growth slows, you can mea-
sure how much sector growth slows.
Another thing to consider is the timing of the response within the sector to 
changes in the economy. This happens because of the order of cash flows through-
out the national economy. An injection of cash into the agricultural sector, for 

CHAPTER 12  Savvy Stock Sales      171
example, will very likely go next to agricultural supply corporations, such as 
Monsanto, because farms and farmers tend to spend a large proportion of their 
revenues on the products these corporations produce. After you understand how 
cash flows through the economy, you can begin to estimate the timing that each 
sector will experience based on where the initial change in cash flows begins. This 
phenomenon is called sector rotation.
After you establish the relationship between a sector and other sectors in the 
economy, you can start to evaluate the sector itself. Here are some questions to 
ask when assessing a sector:
»
» How many competitors are there?
»
» What makes the successful firms more competitive?
»
» What are the risks of new entrants or new technologies shaking things up?
»
» How is the industry as a whole changing over time?
»
» How is it doing compared to other industries?
Factoring in stock market fluctuations
The stock market is completely insane. The prices of stocks can increase or 
decrease in response to something completely unrelated. Much of this goes well 
outside the scope of this book, into the territory of books specializing in stock 
investing. Chapter  22 is on behavioral finance, which talks about these move-
ments somewhat, though.
Considering macroeconomics
Macroeconomics is the study of large-scale, collective economic management. It’s 
usually related to the national economy or other issues involving an aggregate of 
smaller economic entities. Macroeconomics is a very complex subject, and this 
isn’t really a macroeconomics book, so I talk just briefly about some of the mac-
roeconomic influences on performance, value, and price:
»
» GDP: Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of all production created 
in a nation. Increasing GDP is often taken as a sign that the economy is strong, 
and that people should invest more in stocks.
»
» The business cycle: Two or more consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth 
is the current definition of a recession, which is one of the four parts of the 
business cycle, the others being recovery, boom, and slump. The rate of change 
in growth that an economy experiences changes stock prices quite a bit.

172      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
»
» Employment: Employment is the ratio of people who have jobs compared to 
the total workforce. Unemployment is the ratio of people who don’t have jobs 
compared to the total workforce. High unemployment tends to harm stock 
prices.
»
» Inflation: Inflation is a change in the purchasing power of a currency, 
meaning that it takes more money to purchase an equal amount of goods. 
You know how gas used to be cheaper than it is now? That’s due to inflation. 
High inflation tends to slow stock market value growth.
»
» Monetary policy: Monetary policy includes any policy regarding the quantity 
or price of money. That includes altering interest rates, altering bank reserve 
requirements, altering the amount of money being printed or distributed, and 
other related policies. Expansionary monetary policy, such as lowering 
interest rates and reducing bank reserve requirements, tends to increase 
stock market prices. Increased interest rates and any policy that reduces the 
supply of money tends to lower stock prices.
»
» Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy refers to any issues related to taxation and 
government spending. The influence of these policies on stock prices depends 
greatly on the specifics of the policy. Increases in spending help those 
companies who receive the government funds. Even higher taxation depends 
greatly on who is being taxed, as well as what the tax money is being 
spent on.

or a financial tool that was originally designed to reduce the amount of risk 
associated with many of the most common corporate transactions, deriva-
tives have become a veritable minefield for many companies. Not only can 
there be a strong attraction for the use of derivatives as a way to generate income 
despite the high level of risk this can create, but derivatives are also frequently not 
properly represented in corporate financial statements. Still, despite the common 
pitfalls, derivatives really are quite simple to understand and use. This chapter 
explains more.
Deriving Value
Derivatives are legal contracts that set the terms of a transaction that can be bought 
and sold as the current market price varies against the terms in the contract. Orig-
inally, derivatives were all about bringing price stability to products that can be 
quite volatile in their pricing over short periods of time. Prices change quite a lot 
over time, which adds a degree of uncertainty and risk for those who either pro-
duce or purchase large quantities of goods.

Say, for example, that a producer of candy corn anticipates producing ten tons of 
the candy but is afraid that prices will go down before it produces and sells it all, 
putting the producer at risk of earning lower profits or even losing money on the 
sale, because the producer is incurring overall prices as it produces the candy 
corn. The producer calls its derivatives agent, who then puts together whichever 
type of derivatives contract the producer wants and attempts to find a buyer who 
will purchase the candy corn at a later date, using the terms of the derivatives 
contract. On the flip side, say that a buyer of candy corn knows it wants to pur-
chase ten tons of the candy about four weeks before Halloween but is afraid prices 
will increase by then. The buyer can also call an agent to create a derivatives con-
tract for the purchase of candy corn.
By speculating on the changes in future prices, companies have the opportunity to 
buy and sell many derivatives contracts at a profit simply because of other peo-
ple’s willingness to trade these contracts. As a result, derivatives have dramati-
cally increased in popularity as a method of generating income. They can be 
purchased and then resold at a profit; however, the whole process involves a great 
deal of risk of multiple types. Although derivatives have fallen under attack in 
recent years, when used responsibly, they can provide companies with a useful 
financial tool.
I spend the rest of the chapter talking about the four most common types of 
derivatives:
»
» Options
»
» Forwards
»
» Futures
»
» Swaps
Keeping Your Options Open
Options are contracts that give the buyer the right to buy or sell a fixed number of 
goods at a predetermined price, but they don’t obligate the buyer to do so.
The two primary types of options are
»
» Put options: When purchased, put options give the holder of the option the 
right to sell a predetermined unit quantity of some asset at a predetermined 
price, called the strike price, before some predetermined future date, called 
the expiration date.

CHAPTER 13  Pricing Probability from Derived Value      175
»
» Call options: Call options work in a very similar manner, except that they give 
the buyer the option to purchase those goods rather than sell them. When 
buyers decide to use the option to buy or sell goods, they exercise their option; 
when they decide not to use the option, they either let the option expire or, if 
possible, try to resell it.
Choosing between put and call
Companies can use both put and call options as tools for managing risk. For exam-
ple, when you buy a put option, your goal is to make sure you can sell your goods 
for the best price possible. The put option might say, for example, that you have 
ten tons of candy corn to sell at a strike price of $10,000. If the price goes down 
between the purchase of the put option and the expiration date, then you would 
exercise your option in order to sell the candy corn for a higher price than what 
the market is currently offering. If, on the other hand, the price goes up, you 
would let the option expire because you could sell the candy corn for a higher price 
on the market.
Call options allow companies to purchase goods at the strike price. Continuing 
with the candy corn example, to limit risk, an interested buyer might purchase the 
call option with a strike price of $10,000 for ten tons of candy corn in order to get 
the lowest price possible. If the price goes down before the expiration date, the 
buyer will simply let the contract expire and buy the candy corn on the market for 
the lower price. If the price goes up, however, then the buyer will exercise the call 
option in order to buy the candy corn more cheaply than the market is currently 
offering.
In case you’re wondering, options aren’t sold for free. The seller of the option 
generates revenue equal to the sale price of the option (which also floats in a man-
ner similar to stocks based, in part, on investor sentiment and the belief of future 
potential), which gives the seller incentive to sell the options; however, the seller 
must use them carefully because risk is involved. This is true for both call and put 
options; they both generate sales revenues but also obligate the seller to a future 
transaction that may not be in the seller’s best interest. The seller of an option is 
planning to either buy or sell the goods at the strike price anyway or betting that 
the buyer won’t exercise the option due to price conditions that are unfavorable 
for the buyer.
In the case where a seller sells options purely to generate revenue without any 
expectations of participating in an exchange at the strike price, that seller puts 
himself at great risk of losses or potential losses that aren’t otherwise recorded on 
standard financial reports, which can cause concern for investors as well as the 
company itself.

176      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Valuing an option
Multiple mathematical models have been developed for the purpose of estimating 
the value of an option. Because most of these models involve math that’s too com-
plex for this book’s scope, I focus on just one of the more popular valuation equa-
tions here and show you how you can apply it in an investing portfolio strategy.
To find the value of selling an option, simply use this equation:
P
X
Value of selling an option
In this equation, P is the price of the option sold, giving the seller revenues, while 
X is the value of the exchange to the seller. Note that you can assume that X will 
always be negative; otherwise, the option holder wouldn’t exercise the option in 
the first place, which would leave X at 0, meaning the seller generated only 
revenues.
The equation for finding the value of buying an option is just as easy:
X
P
Value of buying an option
In this equation, you subtract the buying price (P) from the value of the exchange 
to the buyer (X). You can assume that X is always positive here; otherwise, the 
buyer wouldn’t exercise the option, leaving P equal to 0, meaning that the buyer 
lost only the cost of buying the option in the first place.
The more complex and arguably more accurate valuation methods all incorporate 
two major elements:
»
» Value over time: The value of an option changes over time relative to 
increases in the risk-free rate and the underlying assets.
»
» Probability of a particular outcome and the value placed on that 
probability: The likelihood of the anticipated event is weighted by the 
influence that the event will have.
Option valuation holds a special place in the hearts of investors because it allows 
for some very effective portfolio strategies. After all, options allow investors to set 
parameters on the amount of loss or gain they can experience. For example, if an 
investor were hoping to limit their potential losses, they would purchase a put 
option only. If an investor were planning to sell their stock after the price goes up, 
then they could sell call options at that price, generating income on the call 
options in addition to the revenue they make from selling at the higher price. In 
turn, they could use the revenue generated from selling the call options to pur-
chase the put options for mitigating loss, creating a strategy called a straddle.

CHAPTER 13  Pricing Probability from Derived Value      177
Paying It Forward
A forward is an agreement between parties to perform a sale of a specific type of 
good in a predetermined quantity at a predetermined price at a predetermined 
date in the future. Unlike options, which give either the buyer or the seller the 
right to participate in the transaction but do not obligate them, forward contracts 
are legal obligations to perform the transaction on or before a specific date. The 
good thing about forwards is that they’re very customizable and can include any 
details or additional terms as long as all the relevant parties agree to the terms.
Forward contracts aren’t bought and sold in the same manner as many derivatives 
contracts. Rather, two or more parties develop a legal contract, sign into that con-
tract, and typically fulfill the contractual obligations themselves. So, neither party 
purchases nor sells the actual contract (unless you count the fees for having the 
contract drawn up).
Say that Janna wants to buy 200.5 pounds of wool. The industry standard, accord-
ing to my wife, an avid knitter, is to sell wool only by the pound, not divisions of 
a pound. Janna is afraid that the price is going to increase before this season’s 
cuttings (the wool term for crop), so she goes and talks to the farmer who produces 
the wool. Janna and the farmer agree to a forward contract because the farmer is 
afraid that the price may drop. These are the terms of their contract:
Product: White lamb’s wool, first cutting of the season, carded
Quantity: 200.5 pounds
Delivery Price: $1,500
Delivery Date: February 28, 2022
Both parties in the contract must execute their part in the contract, and the con-
tract itself is likely to include penalties for nondelivery. Note that in the preceding 
example, the quantity agreed upon is 200.5 pounds, despite the industry standard 
of selling in increments of 1 pound. This high customizability is one of the primary 
benefits of a forward contract.
Agreeing to forward
The reason companies and individuals enter into forward contracts is to reduce 
the amount of price uncertainty and volatility, particularly seasonal volatility, 
involved with buying or selling goods. Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers 
to agree upon a price and quantity of goods to be exchanged, sometimes even 
before production has begun. For buyers, not only does this arrangement provide 

178      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
increased certainty that they’ll get exactly the quantity they need without com-
peting with other buyers for the same pool of suppliers, but it also guarantees that 
the price won’t increase by the time of the delivery date. For sellers, forward con-
tracts not only ensure that they’ll have a buyer for their products rather than risk-
ing being left with a surplus but also guarantees that the price won’t drop suddenly 
before the delivery date.
On both a national scale and a global scale, the use of derivatives in managing risk 
means price stability. Many goods around the world, particularly primary goods 
such as agriculture, experience seasonal fluctuations. During harvest season, the 
quantity of goods supplied increases quite a lot, while during the off-season, the 
quantity drops below demand. These fluctuations in supply cause serious seasonal 
price volatility. Derivatives in general help alleviate this volatility, and forwards are 
easily the best method for addressing the individual needs of both buyers and sellers.
Generating revenues with forward contracts is somewhat more difficult than 
doing so with most other forms of derivatives. Because forward contracts are so 
customizable, they aren’t conducive to trading. After all, finding another buyer 
who wants the exact same contract you created to fit your needs and those of the 
other party can be nearly impossible.
There’s really only one common way to generate revenues from forward con-
tracts, but you have to be particularly confident in your assessment of the future 
prices of goods. As a buyer, you can enter into a contract that has a price very low 
compared to your estimate of the future market price (also called the spot rate), get 
your inventory of goods, and then resell them at the market price. If you’re a 
seller, you can simply enter into a contract that has a price much higher than your 
expected future market price.
Valuing a forward
The value of a forward contract depends greatly on the fluctuations in the market 
price of goods. You can use a number of different calculations to determine the 
value of a forward contract, but generally speaking, each calculation is built on the 
following two basic ideas:
»
» The current price of a forward contract should be equal to the market 
price of goods at the delivery date plus the opportunity cost associated 
with not pursuing the next-best opportunity. For example, if you’re an 
investor, then the price of the forward contract today should be equal to the 
market price at the date of delivery plus the market rate of compounding 
interest. Of course, you can’t know exactly what the future market price will be 
(if you could, forward contracts wouldn’t serve much purpose). That degree of 
uncertainty is where people attempt to generate income by speculating.

CHAPTER 13  Pricing Probability from Derived Value      179
»
» At the time of delivery, the value of the forward rate is equal to the 
delivery price minus the market price. This is a rather simple hindsight 
measure that determines how effective you were at utilizing forward 
contracts.
Standardizing the Future
In theory, futures contracts are very similar to forward contracts, except that futures 
contracts are highly standardized in a number of ways:
»
» While forward contracts can be for just about anything, futures contracts must 
be for a homogenous commodity of a standardized type and quality.
»
» While forward contracts can be for just about any quantity, each futures 
contract must be for a standardized quantity.
»
» While forward contracts can be in any currency or even barters, futures 
contracts must be in a single currency determined by the location of trade.
»
» While forward contracts can be delivered at any date, futures contracts must 
have a standardized delivery date.
Basically, futures contracts of a single type must all be completely identical. This 
continuity allows futures contracts to be freely bought, sold, and traded. The 
buyer of a futures contract is obligated to the terms of the contract until it’s resold, 
but the buyer doesn’t have to read the contract to know what’s on it because all 
futures contracts of that type are the same. As a result, unlike forward contracts, 
futures contracts are highly liquid; that is, they’re sold in very high volume and 
very high frequency on markets (much like stocks).
Predicting futures
Although futures are less customizable than forwards, they’re still extremely 
common (or perhaps even more common than forwards) as a form of risk man-
agement. After all, for those corporations that either produce or purchase goods 
for which futures contracts are available for market trade, futures are extremely 
easy to both buy and sell. The initial contract sale by the producers, called the 
primary market, is quite easy to make, and then that contract will likely change 
hands many, many times before the delivery date. It’ll be traded on the secondary 
market between investors and then, eventually, to the people who really want the 
underlying goods.

180      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
That being said, the actual function of futures in risk management is essentially 
identical to that of forwards, but the liquid nature of futures allows for more 
robust risk management strategies that allow the investor to buy or sell multiple 
times before the delivery date.
Futures are far more viable as a method of revenue generation than forwards, but 
buying and selling futures strictly to generate revenue can be very dangerous to 
attempt. Like stocks, people purchase futures contracts with the expectation that 
the price will change dramatically either up or down and then resell the contract 
to the seller or the buyer or perhaps even to other investors. The point is to sell 
these contracts before the delivery date for more than you bought them for or for 
less value than the delivery should you decide that you want the goods underlying 
the contract (which, in many cases, is cash, making that valuation particularly 
simple to calculate).
When you buy and sell futures solely to generate revenue, not only do you risk 
losing value through these trade exchanges as with stocks, but in the case of com-
modities, the underlying goods to be delivered may also be worth less than you 
paid for them. As with options, these risks cause deviations between the book 
value of a corporation’s assets and the real value of asset obligations through 
futures contracts.
Valuing futures
Because the mechanics of a futures contract are the same as those of a forward 
contract, the valuation methods also tend to be the same. The basics of valuation 
that I discuss in the previous section on forwards still apply, and a number of 
variations have been applied either to customize the calculations for the individ-
ual needs of the parties involved or to improve on the accuracy for investing pur-
poses. As noted, though, the increased liquidity in futures allows for additional 
strategies involving futures that more closely resemble stock investing strategies 
instead of simply hedging the risk of the exchange of the assets underlying the 
futures contract.
Swapping Numbers
Of the four most common derivatives in this chapter, the swap is easily the most 
confusing. Each swap involves two agreements rather than just one. Swaps occur 
when corporations agree to exchange something of value with the expectation of 
exchanging back at some future date.

CHAPTER 13  Pricing Probability from Derived Value      181
Corporations can apply swaps to a number of different things of value, usually 
currency or specific types of cash flows. Simply speaking, they allow corporations 
to benefit from transactions that otherwise would not be possible to them in a 
timely or cost-effective manner. Because swaps give corporations the opportunity 
to shift the performance of their assets quickly and cheaply without exchanging 
ownership of those assets, they’ve become extremely popular as a method of 
managing risk and generating revenues. Swaps are typically done through a swap 
broker, a company that deals in swaps and makes money off the bid-ask spread (the 
difference between the bid price and ask price) on these exchanges.
Managing risk with swaps
Swaps are used to manage risk in a couple ways. First, you can use swaps to ensure 
favorable cash flows, either through timing (as with the coupons on bonds) or 
through the types of assets being exchanged (as with foreign exchange swaps that 
ensure a corporation has the right type of currency). The exact nature of the risk 
being managed depends on the type of swap being used.
The easiest way to see how companies can use swaps to manage risks is to follow 
a simple example using interest-rate swaps, the most common form of swaps.
1.	 Company A owns $1,000,000 in fixed-rate bonds earning 5 percent annually, 
which is $50,000 in cash flows each year.
2.	 Company A thinks interest rates will rise to 10 percent, which will yield 
$100,000 in annual cash flows ($50,000 more per year than their current bond 
holdings), but exchanging all $1,000,000 for bonds that will yield the higher rate 
would be too costly.
3.	 Company A goes to a swap broker and exchanges not the bonds themselves 
but the company’s right to the future cash flows. Company A agrees to give the 
swap broker the $50,000 in fixed-rate annual cash flows, and in return, the 
swap broker gives the company the cash flows from variable rate bonds worth 
$1,000,000.
4.	 Company A and the swap broker continue to exchange these cash flows over 
the life of the swap, which ends on a date determined at the time the contract 
is signed.
In this example, swaps help Company A manage its risk by making available to 
Company A the possibility of altering its investment portfolio without the costly, 
difficult, and sometimes impossible process of rearranging asset ownership. As a 
result, Company A makes an additional $50,000 per year in bond returns. Of 
course, like with many investments, the company could also lose money if interest 
rates were to decrease rather than increase as Company A projected.

182      PART 3  Valuations on the Price Tags of Business
Each side typically benefits from swaps, and it’s the job of the swap broker to help 
different corporations that would benefit from swapping together to find each 
other. The swap broker earns money by charging a fee.
Generating revenue with swaps
When pursuing opportunities to generate revenue through swaps, the process is 
no different, but the motivation behind the swap is to take advantage of differen-
tials in the spot and anticipated future values related to the swap. To see how 
revenue generation works with swaps, consider the following example, which 
involves foreign exchange swaps, a simpler but less common form of swap (in the 
example, USD = U.S. dollar):
1.	 Company A has USD 1,000 and believes that the Chinese Yuan (CNY) is set to 
increase in value compared to the USD.
2.	 Company A gets in touch with Company B in China, which just happens to 
need USD for a short time to fund a capital investment in computers coming 
from the United States.
3.	 The two companies agree to swap currency at the current market exchange rate, 
which for this example, is USD 1 = CNY 1. They swap USD 1,000 for CNY 1,000. 
The swap agreement states that they’ll exchange currencies back in one year at 
the forward rate (also USD 1 = CNY 1; it’s a very stable market in Example-World).
In the example, Company B needs the currency but doesn’t want to pay the trans-
action fees, while Company A is speculating on the change in exchange rate. If the 
CNY were to increase by 1 percent compared to the USD, then Company A would 
make a profit on the swap. If the CNY were to decrease in value by 1 percent, then 
Company A would lose money on the swap. This potential for loss is why using 
derivatives to generate income is called speculating. (Did you know the term spec-
ulate means “to come by way of very loose interpretation” or “to guess”?)
Valuing a swap
The value of a swap isn’t very difficult to measure. Simply put, you start with the 
value of what you’re receiving plus any added value that results from changes in 
rates or returns and then subtract the value of what you’re giving away plus any 
increases in value associated with interest earned or changes in rates.
When you’re estimating future value, the calculations involve the time value of 
money and the probabilities of event occurrences, both of which should be treated 
in the same manner as estimating the value of futures. Remember that a swap is 
nothing more than a combination of a spot rate exchange and a futures exchange 
in a single contract.

usiness finance is filled with risk. Okay, so maybe it’s not the same kind of 
risk that you’d face as a soldier or police officer (although any witness to 
the trading floors of a major stock exchange may argue that Wall Street can 
quite resemble a war zone), but no one laughs when their job is at risk because 
someone messed up managing the risks associated with corporate finances. This 
chapter discusses some of the more common forms of risk encountered in corpo-
rate finance.
Understanding that Risk Is Unavoidable
You may think that when it comes to managing corporate finances, you should 
avoid risk at all cost (pun intended!). The reality is quite the contrary, though: 
Risk is an inherent, and therefore unavoidable, part of every financial decision 
that a company makes.
The real goal of managing financial risk is to assess the degree of risk associated 
with each potential option for a given decision, mathematically calculate the 
probability of it occurring, and determine whether the potential losses and prob-
abilities associated with that risk exceed the potential returns.

inflation

186      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
On a broader level, you can think of risk as a form of cost. No corporation can 
avoid 100 percent of risk all the time, and each time something goes wrong, the 
corporation will lose money fixing the problem. The total amount of losses due to 
the risky nature of financial transactions influences how competitive your busi-
ness is, the price you should charge, and your company’s profitability. Costs that 
don’t add any value to the product or the company (known as non-value-added 
costs) should be managed as much as possible to minimize the risk while maxi-
mizing returns.
In general, risk falls into the following categories, which I describe in detail 
throughout the rest of this chapter:
»
» Interest-rate/inflation risk: The risk that interest rates or inflation will 
outpace your returns
»
» Market risk: The risk that the entire economy might do poorly
»
» Credit risk: The risk that borrowers won’t repay their loans
»
» Off-balance-sheet risk: The risk that something not included on the balance 
sheet is influencing corporate value (such as unrealized gains/losses from 
derivatives investing)
»
» Foreign exchange risk: The risk of losing value through fluctuations in 
foreign exchange rates
»
» Operating risk: Risks associated with corporate operations
»
» Liquidity risk: The risk of not having enough money on hand when bills 
become due
Risking Your Interest with Inflation
The vast majority of products available for investment that yield interest offer 
fixed-rate returns. A fixed-rate return means that if you purchase an investment 
that offers a 1 percent annual interest rate, then you’re going to earn 1 percent  
annually — no more, no less.
When you earn 1 percent interest on an investment, it doesn’t matter whether 
interest rates go up or down during that time, nor does it matter how high infla-
tion rates go; you still only earn 1 percent. This risk of losing value on assets 
because the interest rates you earn have the potential to lag behind market inter-
est rates or inflation rates is called interest-rate risk.

CHAPTER 14  Managing Uncertainty      187
The interest rate can quite easily outpace the rate inherent in a number of other 
investments. If you purchase a bond that pays 1 percent per year in cash flows (in 
other words, every year the bond earns you another 1 percent of the purchase price 
in coupon payments), but then the market interest rate increases to 2 percent, the 
value of your future cash flows decreases by 50 percent relative to the market rate. 
So, if you ever try to sell the bond or any part of it, it won’t be worth nearly as 
much, and even if you continue to hold the bond, your future cash flows won’t 
keep up with market returns.
The risk that inflation will outpace your assets is often categorized as a special 
type of interest-rate risk called inflationary risk. This form of risk is really quite 
simple to understand. Inflation means that the overall price level within a nation 
increases. Remember how bread, eggs, and fuel used to be much cheaper than 
they are today? That’s because inflation reduces the amount of goods you can 
purchase with a single unit of currency. In other words, if inflation increases by  
1 percent in a year, then $1 will purchase 1 percent less next year than it does this 
year. So, if you have your money in an investment that’s earning 0.5 percent 
interest each year, you’re losing 0.5 percent of the purchasing power of the cur-
rency, reducing the real value of your investment even if the nominal value is 
increasing. This is usually only a problem with investments that are considered 
“risk free,” such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit, savings accounts, and 
some low-yield bonds.
Minimizing Market Risk
Your company is careful. It chooses only the best customers, only the best invest-
ments, uses derivatives only to mitigate potential losses, diversifies clients and 
investments, and does everything right to reduce the risk associated with every 
single penny. You have the safest and most stable company in the entire 
nation . . . and then the entire national economy collapses.
No matter how successful you are at managing the risk of your company, there’s 
always the risk that the nation in which you’re operating will experience total 
economic meltdown.
The vast majority of people really have no idea how to recognize the warning signs 
of a very large recession in the near future; not that it would help them to know 
it’s coming, mind you, because there’s nothing a single company can do to stop it 
from happening. But a company can take steps to mitigate the amount of loss 
associated with market risk, such as international diversification (see Chapter 21) 
or the use of derivatives.

188      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
The best way to decrease the amount of market risk your company experiences is 
to diversify internationally. That may sound like a much more problematic strat-
egy than it really is. The big problem with market risk isn’t necessarily the loss of 
value, but rather the loss of customers. Even simply exporting your goods or ser-
vices internationally to nations not experiencing the same recession may help to 
stabilize your company’s revenue streams to an extent, at least minimizing the 
damage, although not eliminating it altogether.
An advantage of these recessionary periods is that the pool of potential employees 
all competing for a limited number of jobs increases. This competition allows your 
company to acquire labor at lower prices, helping to decrease costs during an oth-
erwise difficult period.
Don’t think for a single moment that your company is immune from market risk. 
National recessions are common and inevitable under the current methods of eco-
nomic management. They can also be highly devastating for the companies in the 
nation experiencing the recession; many companies lose customers, file bank-
ruptcy, or even go out of business entirely.
Giving Credit Where It’s Due
Credit is a form of loan. Corporations frequently provide their goods or services to 
customers on credit, which means that they expect to get paid at some later date. 
Extending credit is common for furniture stores, car dealerships, many busi-
nesses that sell to other businesses, and just about any company that deals in 
goods that are considered expensive for customers to purchase. Say you use your 
credit card to purchase bubblegum. That purchase is a risk for the company that 
issued you the credit card, because they pay the bubblegum dealer for your bub-
blegum under the expectation that you’ll pay them back. On the company’s bal-
ance sheet, this transaction is considered an accounts receivable for the lender 
until it receives payment.
Offering credit sounds like a great idea for the company. More expensive items can 
be quite difficult to purchase all at once, so allowing customers to make purchases 
on credit improves their ability to afford the company’s products. This strategy 
also helps companies generate revenues by earning interest on those sales made 
on credit.
A company has to be very careful, though, when attempting to benefit from 
extending credit to its customers because there’s always the chance that the com-
pany won’t get paid back. Credit risk is, then, the risk that someone won’t pay back 
their loans.

CHAPTER 14  Managing Uncertainty      189
Credit risk is typically assessed on an individual basis. Each customer is evaluated 
on the following criteria:
»
» Cash flow to determine whether they’ll have the cash to pay off the loan
»
» Book value to ensure that should they default, there will be collateral 
compensation
»
» Payment history to see how they have paid back prior loans
This credit risk assessment works a lot like your personal credit score. If a com-
pany decides that a person is too likely to default on the loan, meaning that they 
are at high risk of not paying it back, then the company won’t give them the loan 
(or at least it shouldn’t; though, as the major banks around the world have proven, 
stupidity knows no credit score).
So, what happens when a person doesn’t pay back their loan? The company loses 
money. As with other forms of risk, because this loss of money doesn’t add value 
to the company, it’s considered a non-value-added cost, which is a bad thing.
Should the company stop offering credit? If the person in charge of managing risk 
is very bad at their job, then the company may lose more money due to credit risk 
than the potential increase in revenues generated by customers using credit. Such 
a loss is rarely ever the case, however.
Most companies determine the interest rate they will charge based on the level of 
risk incurred. On average, a customer who’s a higher credit risk incurs greater 
costs for the company, so the company charges a higher interest rate to make up 
for the higher costs. This strategy is debatable, of course, because the higher 
interest rate increases the risk that the person will default. Creditors will continue 
extending credit to customers of higher and higher risk until the costs of extend-
ing that credit (in addition to the costs associated with repayment risk) exceeds 
the amount of revenues generated for that person (in economics terms, the point 
where MR = MC).
Overexposure to credit risk was the first mistake that many banks made leading 
up to the 2007 financial collapse. Making mortgage and other loans to people 
without the ability to make the payments or who otherwise had a history of 
defaulting on loans increased the degree of credit risk experienced by those banks. 
During the start of the recession, when these banks exposed to high levels of 
credit risk stopped receiving deposits from their customers who were becoming 
unemployed as the result of an economic slowdown and payments on the loans 
they had issued, they could no longer make the payments on the loans they had 
taken themselves. Thus, they fell victim to another type of risk discussed at the 
very end of this chapter: liquidity risk.

190      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Getting Shady with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
A number of financial activities and transactions don’t influence the balance sheet 
as much as the actual transaction would imply. These instances of off-balance- 
sheet activity are typically considered to be contingent assets and contingent lia-
bilities, which will only be realized if some future event occurs to trigger the 
transaction.
Chapter  13 discusses derivatives, but not the influence of derivatives on the  
balance sheet: These derivatives are some of the most common forms of  
off-balance-sheet transactions. The sale of derivatives, such as options, commits 
a company to either sell or purchase assets in the future, but that commitment is 
contingent upon whether the purchaser of the option decides to exercise their 
right to that option. As a result, this commitment to a transaction is recorded on 
the balance sheet only if the option is exercised.
Off-balance-sheet transactions cause a unique problem for both the company in 
question as well as its investors and lenders, because many balance sheet metrics 
aren’t able to consider these contingent exchanges. This problem can lead to 
financial mismanagement on the part of the company and misled investments on 
the part of investors. When doing balance-sheet metrics, always take into account 
any off-balance-sheet transactions, which will be found either supplementary to 
the balance sheet or can be requested.
Factoring in Foreign Exchange Risk
Different nations use different types of money. The United States uses dollars, and 
Mexico uses pesos, for example. These different types of money change value at 
different rates, so the value of money in one nation can change compared to the 
value of another nation.
For example, you’re probably familiar with the fact that exchange rates change. 
Well, that’s one result of a change in value of a currency. Another result when 
money changes value is a change in the value of everything measured using that 
currency. That change in value creates a special class of risks called foreign 
exchange risk, wherein a change in the value of money between nations causes a 
change in the value of exchanges or a change in the value of foreign-held assets.

CHAPTER 14  Managing Uncertainty      191
Transaction risk
Between the time you sell a product and the time you receive payment, there’s a 
chance that you’ll end up making less than you had agreed upon. The same can be 
said about the time between purchasing a product and receiving the goods: The 
goods may be worth less than you paid for them. These variations happen due to 
fluctuations in something that a single company has absolutely no control over: 
the exchange rate. These two situations are descriptions of something called 
transaction risk.
The following is a completely fictional example using real companies whose 
names have been changed to protect the innocent: American auto company Furd 
purchases $10,000 worth of electronic components from Korean electronics com-
pany Samsong, but before Furd pays for the parts, the U.S. dollar drops in value 
compared to the Korean won by 50 percent. So, when Samsong tries to exchange 
the dollars into its own currency, it only receives about half of what it originally 
expected.
This risk is called transaction risk: the risk that the transaction will lose value at 
some point before it’s complete.
There’s not much a company can do to stop exchange rates from changing, but a 
company can employ strategies to make the best of such changes. In the preceding 
example, the fictional Samsong can compensate for the change in the exchange 
rate in one of three ways:
»
» Samsong can improve the value of the U.S. currency by simply using it to 
purchase goods from the United States, returning the currency to its country 
of origin for something of greater value to the Koreans.
»
» Samsong can just hold onto the U.S. dollars in the hopes that the exchange 
rate will increase their value again.
»
» Samsong can just account for the loss as a cost and learn how to avoid this 
mistake in the future — before it happens! A novel concept in risk manage-
ment is the use of preventative measures such as those discussed in 
Chapter 13.
Translation risk
When you’re managing assets across multiple nations or, at least, multiple cur-
rencies, you don’t even have to make a transaction to be subject to foreign 
exchange risk. That’s right, the value of your assets can plummet while you’re just 
sitting there picking your nose (which is gross; stop it). This happens not as a 

192      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
result of an actual decrease in the usefulness of the assets, a decrease in the quan-
tity of assets, or even necessarily a decrease in the nominal value of those assets 
in a single currency.
Translation risk, so named because of the translation of value from one currency to 
another, is the risk that a change in exchange rates will make one’s foreign-held 
assets worth less when exchanged into the home-nation’s currency.
There are two distinct forms of harm that can result from translation risk:
»
» If a company expects to repatriate its foreign cash assets by bringing those 
foreign assets back to its home nation and then exchanging them into the 
home nation’s currency, the company will get less currency than it expected 
prior to the change in the foreign exchange rate.
»
» A fluctuation in exchange rates can have a significant impact on the balance 
sheet of the company. Any assets denominated in a foreign currency will cause 
a decrease in the book value of the company as a whole if that currency 
depreciates against the home currency. This depreciation has the potential to 
significantly alter the ability of a company to attract capital because the 
proportion of debt to total assets increases when the total asset value 
decreases. As you can imagine, this proportionate change is a bad thing for 
investors as well as for an organization that wants to attract new debt or equity.
On the other hand, if a company doesn’t intend to move its assets or attract new 
investors, then this change in asset value will do little harm to the company. The 
assets maintain equivalent nominal value in the foreign currency and equivalent 
usefulness for the company except in exchange rate transactions. In fact, the 
decrease in book value may provide the company an opportunity to purchase 
equity shares more cheaply as its stock price drops in response to the decrease in 
book value. Because the company’s fundamental operating strength hasn’t 
changed and exchange rate fluctuations tend to be cyclical over time, the company 
could resell those treasury shares for a profit later.
Other foreign exchange risk
Two more major forms of risk are associated with holding foreign assets, but they 
aren’t related to the value of the assets themselves but, rather, the ability to use 
these assets:
»
» Convertibility risk means that you may have a foreign currency on hand, but 
you may not be able to convert it into another currency. Some currencies can 
be very difficult or nearly impossible to exchange for more common curren-
cies simply because no one wants these currencies.

CHAPTER 14  Managing Uncertainty      193
If you have operations in a nation whose currency is very volatile or rarely 
used, you may find it difficult to find anyone willing to take that currency in 
exchange for a more common currency.
»
» Repatriation risk is usually considered a subcategory under the broader 
heading of political risk. But from a purely financial perspective, repatriation 
risk reflects the possibility that a foreign government may decide to cap or 
even prohibit any assets — financial or otherwise — from leaving the nation.
This policy is usually adopted by nations with very small or otherwise volatile 
economies. In a misguided attempt to bring growth and stabilization, they 
require investors and local nationals to maintain assets within the nation 
rather than attempting to repatriate them back to their home nation. The 
belief is that this will stimulate additional trade and investment within the 
nation as people are forced to spend their income and profits in the nation 
rather than taking them out of the nation.
The result for businesses is the risk that they won’t be able to use their assets 
outside of that nation, making them useless unless they have a reason to use 
them there already as a part of a broader business strategy.
Identifying Operating Risk
Operating risk, or operational risk, is the risk of losses or costs associated with 
business operations. According to the Basel Accords on banking supervision, 
which is the widely used reference for the definition and parameters of operating 
risk, this category includes just about every possible non-value-added cost that a 
company can experience — from fraud and theft to negligence and stupidity to 
accidental events such as the acquisition of faulty equipment or the occurrence of 
a natural disaster.
For our purposes, operating risk is the probability of any non-value-added costs 
being incurred as a result of a company’s internal operations, systematic or not. 
Here I give you two quick examples, including how to reduce the associated risk.
»
» I am, by no means, an expert on earthquakes. I don’t know whether there’s a 
way to predict them, but if so, I know we’re not currently using it. So, for our 
purposes, earthquakes can’t be predicted. That said, any company that sets 
up operations in an area known for having earthquakes is subject to the risk 
of losses and costs associated with earthquakes. That doesn’t mean setting up 
in an earthquake area is a bad thing; it just means that the company must 
assess the potential losses associated with earthquakes in that region and 

194      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
determine whether it can earn enough revenues to make up for those costs. 
Financial management can’t do much to mitigate the risk of earthquakes 
except, perhaps, purchase insurance. Financial analysis, however, can provide 
information about whether the benefits of locating a company in an earth-
quake zone compared to the next-best choice surpass the expected costs 
associated with purchasing insurance, repairing damage, and potentially even 
rebuilding completely.
»
» In this second example, financial management can help to identify the 
problem. Say a company isn’t operating as efficiently as it should be, but no 
one can figure out why. Management must bring in the finance department to 
be detectives! Any halfway decent financial analyst can trace the intra-­
organizational cash flows, meaning that they can break down every function 
of the company and account for the costs incurred by each department 
compared to the movement of cash between departments. The analyst might 
discover that money is being lost in the marketing department that isn’t 
accounted for in its expenditures and that a computer has been hacked that’s 
allowing an employee to embezzle money from the marketing budget. 
Performing internal audits like this helps companies to reduce losses from 
operating risk.
Looking at Liquidity Risk
Do you have money owed to you but not enough to pay the bills in the meantime? 
If so, you’re a victim of liquidity risk! The most extreme form of liquidity risk, 
called insolvency, occurs when a company is completely incapable of paying the 
money it owes and must file some form of bankruptcy (to either restructure or 
eliminate debt), sell its operating assets to make the payments it owes, or simply 
go out of business. Insolvency doesn’t necessarily happen when a company is 
doing poorly; quite the contrary, it can happen just as easily when a company is 
too successful.
Imagine for a moment that you own a company that sells large manufacturing 
robots. Each one sells for $1 million. Now, $1 million isn’t a cheap price for a piece 
of equipment, even for very large companies, so odds are your customers will pay 
for these robots on credit, making monthly payments over the course of several 
months or years. Say this company of yours becomes wildly popular and starts 
making lots of sales with very high profits. The problem comes in when your 
company starts spending more money to make the machines you’re selling than 
it’s receiving in monthly payments. In order to fulfill these sales orders and make 
the big profits you want, you still have to order supplies to build the machines 
you’re selling. If you spend all your money on supplies but don’t receive enough 
in monthly payments from past customers to cover the cost, you’re putting your 

CHAPTER 14  Managing Uncertainty      195
company at liquidity risk. This scenario isn’t insolvency yet because you’re still 
making payments, but liquidity risk can turn into insolvency if the problem isn’t 
resolved quickly.
That’s not to say that liquidity risk can’t be derived from simple poor financial 
management, though, either. If a company derives too much of its capital from 
debt, it may find itself in a position where it can no longer afford to make the 
interest payments and should probably consider raising equity to decrease the 
interest payments. A lack of customers stemming from an inability to compete or 
generalized market risk can also cause insolvency.
When the banks involved in the 2007 financial collapse stopped generating reve-
nues as a result of their poor management of credit risk, they became incapable of 
making payments on those loans they had taken themselves, including the inter-
est owed on deposits and other bank products. This scenario led many of even the 
largest banks to become insolvent as a result of liquidity risk. Many banks went 
out of business, and some of the largest banks in the world required government 
assistance.
Sorting Your Customer’s Laundry
Believe it or not, people in business will sometimes do things that are somewhat 
less than ethical and/or legal. People who work in finance, by the nature of their 
work, generally have a degree of access to the financial records and details behind 
the transactions that take place. Often people in finance are specifically recruited 
in order to process or even actively manage illegal activities in order to prevent 
oversight and to keep law enforcement agencies from scrutinizing these 
activities.
Sometimes this is simply by nature of being a trusted provider of financial ser-
vices that can make things look professional. In other cases, the financial expert 
takes a more active role in doing things that either hurt their clients or are 
intended to hide the harmful actions of their clients. The legal and ethical risks 
associated with the financial sector are extensive, mostly in terms of how opera-
tions should be performed. However, there are some unique laws in place intended 
to protect the providers of financial services, and their customers, from this sort 
of risk.

196      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
“Know Your Customer” (KYC) is a concept intended to protect customers of finan-
cial services and products, but is also useful for protecting the providers in a very 
functional way. There are a series of formal rules associated with KYC, but the idea 
is simple: A financial expert should collect and record all the data and information 
necessary to assess the relevant financial position as well as the intentions and 
amount of financial knowledge each of their clients has.
By knowing who your client is and what their goals are, you are better able to pro-
vide them with information and recommendations that are aligned with their own 
view of how their assets should be managed, rather than your personal view of 
how they should be managed. This is also vital for financial experts to protect 
themselves because, during the process of discovering what their clients are doing 
and the intentions behind their actions, if any illegal or otherwise unscrupulous 
activity is noticed, it is wise to reject that particular client to avoid the repercus-
sions that come with working with criminals.
Simply obligating financial experts to know their clients does not protect anybody 
if the financial expert does not choose to respond appropriately. There are some 
minor rules regarding “fiduciary responsibility,” which refers to the obligation of 
a financial expert to work in the best interest of their clients rather than them-
selves, but the concept has little proper enforcement. In addition, if a financial 
expert sees some kind of unethical activities happening but chooses to work with 
that client anyway, that expert is very likely to be exposed to all those nasty things 
that come with associating with black market operations.
Much more blatantly illegal and with much more strict enforcement are matters 
related to anti-money laundering (AML). Money laundering refers to any steps 
involved in setting up fake business operations in order to record illegal revenues 
as legal ones. For example, money earned from the illegal sale of exotic aquarium 
fish might be recorded simply as “aquarium installation,” or the seller may have 
an entirely unrelated cash-based business such as an actual laundromat through 
which to process the money and make it look legal. The bottom line is that any 
type of activity that includes unexplained transactions is best avoided.

Through the Looking 
Glass of Modern 
Portfolio Theory
I
n his book Through the Looking Glass, the sequel to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, 
Lewis Carroll describes a girl who walks through a mirror into a world of won-
derful yet threatening nonsense. That pretty much sums up modern portfolio 
theory: The process of mathematically modeling resource-allocation strategies is 
wonderful in its ability to make sense out of chaos, yet is also dangerous when the 
information is misinterpreted in nonsensical ways. A single miscalculated step 
into this land can lead to tragedy. Nevertheless, this threatening nonsense holds 
lessons to be learned; although the assumptions we use in modern portfolio the-
ory are incorrect or impossible to use in a functional way, they give us an under-
standing of the way things work in theory. This, in turn, gives us a foundation 
upon which to develop our understanding of the real world.
This chapter covers the different components of modern portfolio theory, includ-
ing how it’s used, why some believe it’s outdated nonsense, how it has evolved 
from its original form, and whether any of it actually works. I talk a lot about risk, 
how variations in individual investments influence the rest of the portfolio, and 
how to measure your own, personal degree of risk aversion. All these factors are 
intricately interconnected.

Delving into Portfolio Basics
An investment portfolio is not a physical thing, nor is it really a single entity. An 
investment portfolio is a collection of different investments treated as a single 
aggregate, similar to the way cement is a collection of tiny rocks and minerals but 
is treated as a single substance.
An investment portfolio can be measured and analyzed as a single collection of 
different investments, and each individual investment in a portfolio can also be 
measured and analyzed. It doesn’t matter if you are referring to stocks, bonds, 
machinery, or anything else acquired with the expectation of generating a return 
on investment. You can apply this approach to assessing the financial perfor-
mance of product portfolios and deciding what new products will generate the 
greatest value.
Surveying portfolio management strategies
How resources are bought, sold, or otherwise utilized within a portfolio — opti-
mizing the returns of the portfolio by managing which assets the portfolio 
holds — is considered portfolio management. But the portfolio itself remains con-
stant despite the changes of its exact contents. The portfolio itself only changes 
when the underlying investment strategy changes.
That’s why corporations often have multiple portfolios. Each portfolio is managed 
utilizing a unique strategy, based on the goals of the investors. For example, a 
corporation may have a treasury investment portfolio that it uses to generate 
returns on petty cash, while also maintaining a capital investment portfolio that 
includes land, corporate acquisitions and subsidiaries, and other types of capital. 
Each of these portfolios has very different contents and very different purposes 
for existing, and the strategies involved in managing the contents are very differ-
ent as well.
The following list looks briefly at four different portfolio management 
strategies:
»
» Slush fund/petty cash portfolio: A corporation that maintains a cash 
account for irregular small payments that come up from time to time can still 
generate a return on this cash by maintaining a portfolio of short-term, highly 
liquid investments, such as T-bills and dividend-generating funds.
»
» Hedge portfolio: Not to be confused with a hedge fund, a hedge portfolio is 
intended to hedge (take actions that limit risk or uncertainty) other forms of risk 
by managing derivatives and diversifying investments. A portfolio like this 
changes based on the types or amount of risk being accepted by the corporation.

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      199
»
» Debt portfolio: This type of investment portfolio invests exclusively in bonds 
of different types and with different maturity dates, usually with the intention 
of staggering maturity dates and coupon maturities in order to maintain 
regular cash flows.
»
» Property portfolio: A collection of real estate owned by a corporation, often 
referring to commercial or residential investment properties, but also 
including properties owned by a corporation for the purposes of housing 
operations.
»
» Product portfolio: Offering a product to customers requires that corpora-
tions allocate resources to the successful production and distribution of those 
products. The collection of products it offers is considered its product 
portfolio, because it will generate either a positive or negative return on the 
investment required to offer the products.
Portfolios don’t always include just a single class of assets, either. A typical finan-
cial investment portfolio will have the single purpose of maximizing value while 
minimizing risk. Its contents, though, include stocks, bonds, derivatives, and 
treasure assets. The percentage of the total portfolio that each investment type 
represents is managed based on calculations determining how much of the port-
folio’s value is currently at risk of being lost.
Looking at modern portfolio theory
Modern portfolio theory is not about how to value individual investments, but 
rather how to assess the potential synergy between multiple investments. The 
relationship between two or more assets can change the dynamics of a portfolio’s 
total returns and the total risk involved. Modern portfolio theory utilizes a num-
ber of mathematical formulas and financial modeling, all in an attempt to formal-
ize a method of improving your understanding of investing.
Of course, any successful method of standardizing portfolio management will be 
quickly adopted by a large population of investors as they rush to take advantage 
of the new strategy before others have the opportunity. This changes the market 
dynamic of many types of investments, as investors make inherent changes in 
their approach to investing, and some of the front-runners then sell to the late-
adopters as the prices of those equities heavily influenced by the new method 
jump in price. Partly because of the nearly instant response to market changes, 
and partly as a result of advances that improve upon the original methods of mod-
ern portfolio theory, this field is a study in the constant evolution of ideas. Noth-
ing drives innovation like the promise of getting rich!

200      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Understanding passive versus active 
management
When applying modern portfolio theory — or any theory of portfolio management 
for that matter — you can take a passive or an active approach:
»
» Passive portfolio management refers to setting up a portfolio to match 
either the entire market or some well-known index, such as the S&P 500 Stock 
Index or the U.S. Bond Index, as closely as possible. Once established, these 
portfolios are simply left alone to fluctuate along with the indicator that the 
portfolio was set up to follow. Although this approach may seem lazy or 
negligent, it actually avoids common human error and overthinking. I talk 
more about the performance differences between managed portfolios and 
general market portfolios (the most common form of passive portfolio) later 
in this chapter in the section “Optimizing Portfolio Risk.”
»
» Active portfolio management involves regularly changing the contents of a 
portfolio. Every portfolio manager has their own strategies and methods for 
analyzing and optimizing returns, but the point is that the portfolio manager is 
actively buying, selling, and trading the underlying investments. They may try 
to take advantage of short-term fluctuations in price, for example, by making 
multiple trades every day. These include stock funds, bond funds, real estate 
funds, commodity funds, and more.
Regardless of the approach you take, actively managing a portfolio is a 
full-time job. It entails constantly reevaluating existing investments, searching 
for new investments to compare your existing investments against, and 
assessing the degree of risk and the returns being generated by the portfolio 
as a whole.
Joking about Market Efficiency
Two economists are walking down the street when they see a $100 bill lying on the 
ground. The first economist stops to pick it up when the other says, “Don’t bother. 
If it were real, someone would have picked it up already.”
The origins of this joke are not known to your humble author, but it perfectly 
demonstrates the error of the “efficient market hypothesis.” It states that the 
market will respond instantly to new information, ensuring that all investments 
and assets are valued at their fair market price. According to the hypothesis, if 
people all have the same information at the same time and have equal access to 
exchange markets, then prices will instantly adjust to their economic equilibrium 

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      201
(their natural point given the market levels of supply and demand). For example, 
if news comes out that a nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) has dropped, all 
investment types influenced by this news will immediately adjust to the perfect 
price level.
Another way to look at the efficient market hypothesis is to say that, if it were 
true, any opportunities to generate returns on investments are useless because all 
investments instantly change to their proper price whenever new information 
becomes available. Successful investing, then, is either a matter of being lucky in 
managing investments in a manner that speculates information that is not yet 
available or a matter of adopting better methods of understanding investing. If 
anything in this book were brand new, then it would also be subject to the instant 
market response as anyone who reads this book would have the same information 
as you and be able to use that in their investing.
However, overvalued and undervalued investments are extremely common. 
Investor sentiment and error play a massive role, so this hypothesis simply isn’t 
true. The existence of market corrections is a testament to that fact.
Despite the insistence by some (usually political idealogues who have blind faith 
in the perfection of the free market), assets are misvalued all the time and invest-
ments fluctuate in value in response to . . . well, everything, really. Sometimes it 
seems like the market jumps or falls because the wind blows the wrong way one 
day. Of course, there are measurable reasons for market movements, but they’re 
often completely unrelated to the actual value of the asset or investment itself (for 
more information on this, see Chapter 22). Not everyone has the same informa-
tion; some people know more than others, and many receive information at dif-
ferent times and mentally process it in different ways. People don’t have equal 
access to exchanges; professional investors often have custom-designed software 
programs that react to changes in the stock market in fractions of a second, 
whereas the average casual investor doesn’t have this advantage.
The decisions that people make regarding investments all vary as well because 
investors react to news in different ways, have different strategies, and measure the 
value of stocks differently. The point is the market is efficient only in the long term.
In the short term, very frequent and very intense levels of volatility can push  
the value of an asset, investment, or even an entire company well away from its 
“real” value. That being said, those short-term fluctuations tend to orbit around 
the real value of the asset. If the price of a stock is too high, or overvalued, it will 
drop at some point in the future when people realize it’s not worth that price. If a 
stock is undervalued, it will increase in price when people notice the amazing 
bargain that’s available. In the meantime, however, exactly how far and for how 
long the price deviates from the real value of the stock defines how inefficient the 
market really is.

202      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Of course, like much of modern portfolio theory, the efficient market hypothesis 
isn’t really meant to be applied as is. Instead, it provides a starting point, a way to 
measure what the value of an investment or portfolio should be. From there, inves-
tors can build their understanding of markets and measure deviations from effi-
cient response. Incorporating those deviations into their calculations makes them 
more accurate.
Risking Returns
Risk is an unavoidable part of corporate finance. Risk is nothing more than uncer-
tainty: If a financial loss is already known, it is considered a cost or a loss, rather 
than the risk of cost or loss. Eliminating the certainty of loss is the best you can 
accomplish, however, because you always have some degree of uncertainty 
regarding the amount of returns that will be generated and the market conditions 
that set the context for those returns.
If a corporation tried to eliminate financial risk, all operations within the entire 
organization would come to a complete halt within one to two weeks as a result of 
lacking funding for those operations. Rather than attempting to avoid risk — or 
even to make choices that have the smallest risk — corporations tend to make 
those choices that have the biggest differential between risk and financial returns. 
They measure the amount of returns they expect on a potential investment and 
determine the potential costs associated with the risks of that investment. Then 
they use mathematical modeling to determine their best investment option.
In portfolio management, you can minimize the level of total risk and still maxi-
mize financial returns by carefully measuring how different investments change 
in value compared to each other in multi-asset interactions. One way to do this is 
to look at the underlying principles that build your views of financial risk.
If you need a refresher on the nature of risk, turn to Chapter 14 for a more general 
discussion.
Looking at the trade-off between  
risk and return
The first thing to understand is that, according to modern portfolio theory, there’s 
a trade-off between risk and return. All other factors being equal, if a particular 
investment incurs a higher risk of financial loss for prospective investors, those 
investors expect a higher return in order to be attracted to the higher risk.

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      203
Be very careful in your interpretation of the preceding paragraph, because percep-
tion can be misleading. Just because an investor believes that a higher-risk invest-
ment will generate higher returns doesn’t necessarily make it true. Sometimes 
higher-risk investments become less risky over time, attracting more investors 
who then drive up the price/value of the investment by competitively outbidding 
each other. (A larger pool of investors tends to mean a higher price.) In the vast 
majority of cases, though, there is no promise of higher returns on risky assets, so 
the higher risk just tends to scare off potential investors, keeping the returns on a 
given investment low. The only investments that can really try to promise higher 
returns for higher risk are bonds, and even then the higher returns won’t be gen-
erated if the issuing organization goes into default.
Whether a riskier investment will actually generate higher returns is up to the 
individual investor to decide. I talk more about how this is calculated later in this 
chapter, but for now, know that
»
» Exactly how risk is assessed and the amount of expected returns change 
depending on the individual investor.
»
» Investors will, in fact, invest in higher-risk opportunities if they determine that 
doing so will generate higher returns.
The point is that a corporation won’t buy into a higher-risk investment if it  
doesn’t think the investment will generate extra returns. The fact that so many 
high-risk investments do attract investors obviously indicates that there’s some 
perception of higher expected returns (I talk more about this topic in the later 
section “Measuring risk”).
Here’s an important but subtle difference: Higher risk doesn’t necessarily mean 
higher returns, but only those investments that are expected to provide higher 
returns will attract investors. If the risk is too high without the expectation of 
additional returns, no one will buy the investment.
It’s worth noting that this discussion is all about the amount of risk in an individ-
ual investment. That risk can be mitigated by choosing the proper combination of 
investments (keep reading for the lowdown on this strategy).
Diversifying to maximize returns  
and minimize risk
Because the risk of a single investment can’t be totally eliminated, corporations 
attempt to reduce the risk of a portfolio by picking investments that are likely to 
change in value in different ways or at different times. This process is called 

204      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
diversification. Diversification means taking advantage of differences in risk among 
your investments. Investments tend to change in value at different times and even 
in different directions. So, if your portfolio consists of several different invest-
ments and only one of them loses value, the portfolio loses a smaller percentage 
of its value than does that single investment.
Here’s a theoretical example with an extremely low probability of actually hap-
pening. Say that a corporation holds two investments, and these two investments 
change in value in exactly opposite ways. So, if one decreases in value by 1 percent, 
the other increases in value by 1 percent. Between the two investments, any 
changes in value result in not only zero gain but also zero risk. The goal of diver-
sification is to reduce risk by finding several investments that change in value at 
different times, in response to different events, by different percentages, or in 
completely different directions (as in the preceding example). By doing this, you 
reduce the severity of any losses that may occur in a portfolio from the risk asso-
ciated with only one investment. You can mathematically measure the effective-
ness of portfolio diversification. For more on that concept, see Chapter 20.
Now, you may ask yourself why corporations don’t just invest all their money in 
only the best assets. If you diversify your portfolio by investing in a number of 
different assets, that means you’re investing money in assets that are not your 
first choice. The opportunity cost of purchasing an investment intended to diver-
sify a portfolio is the returns generated by the best investments that you could 
have spent that money on instead.
The point of diversification is to reduce the risk to your portfolio more than you 
reduce the returns. Following is a quick example:
Say that Investment A generates 10 percent annual returns, Investment B gener-
ates 5 percent annual returns, and your portfolio has an equal split between 
Investment A and Investment B. X is the amount of portfolio risk as a percentage 
of total value. In the case of this example, 7.5 percent is the amount of annual 
returns generated by the portfolio (10% + 5% = 15% / 2 = 7.5%).
Here’s what you can take from this example:
»
» If X = 7.5%: Obviously Investment A generates 100 percent more returns per 
year, but the actual importance of this depends on the amount of risk. If 
Investment B reduces risk, then the change in risk is the same as the differ-
ence in returns between A and B.
»
» If X > 7.5%: If diversifying risk means that the total risk of the portfolio stays 
above 7.5 percent, then the amount of returns generated decreases at a faster 
rate than diversifying risk. In other words, the portfolio is being diversified 
poorly, taking on more risk for the amount of returns being generated.

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      205
»
» If X < 7.5%: If the portfolio has less than 7.5 percent risk through diversifica-
tion, then it’s generating more returns for the amount of risk being incurred 
because risk is decreasing at a faster rate than returns. This scenario is 
considered an effective use of diversification.
The point is that you want to look for the best investments you can find and then 
diversify by purchasing those investments that provide the highest returns but 
risk losing value under opposite conditions. For example, real estate tends to 
increase in value when interest rates decrease, whereas variable rate bonds 
decrease in value under the same conditions. Putting the two together in a port-
folio, then, is a good choice for reducing risk through diversification, assuming 
that both investments were good choices individually as well.
Considering risk aversion
There are certain risks that no amount of diversification can eliminate, called sys-
tematic risk. On the other hand, specific risk is any risk associated with an individual 
investment that can be eliminated or greatly minimized through diversification. 
Default risk on a bond, liquidity risk on the corporation underlying a stock, and 
the risk of a building losing value in the real estate market are all specific risks. 
You can minimize specific risks through diversification. This strategy can’t stop 
the entire economy as a whole from going down the toilet, though. Sometimes, no 
matter how perfect an individual asset is or how well a portfolio is diversified, a 
nation’s economy goes down the crapper and everything loses value. The risk of 
that happening is called systematic risk.
To minimize systematic risk, you can either diversify internationally (national 
economies tend to change at different rates just like individual investments — see 
GETTING WARREN BUFFETT’S TAKE
Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and one of the richest people in the 
world as a result of his investments, claims that diversification is used only when a cor-
poration lacks confidence or ability, maintaining that diversification is a tool for the 
incompetent (though Mr. Buffett is a bit more tactful about it). This criticism holds an 
important distinction: Diversification simply for the sake of diversification is not very 
helpful.
Yet even Mr. Buffett holds investments in at least 54 companies, far more than your 
average investor, through Berkshire Hathaway (which buys ownership in other 
companies).

206      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Chapter 21), become very good in economics (many people, myself included, tried 
to warn everyone about the coming 2008 financial collapse), or just hope to get 
very lucky.
You may ask, though, “Didn’t you say something about risk-free investments in 
the chapter on bonds?” Why, yes. Yes, I did. Short-term, fixed-rate, highly liquid 
assets issued by organizations with great credit scores are considered to be risk 
free. Basically, that boils down to T-bills, which mature in as little as a few weeks 
but no more than one year, are issued by the government (which has a very high 
credit score), have a fixed return, and can be easily sold. The amount of risk asso-
ciated with T-bills is so small that they’re considered risk free.
The problem is that they also offer very, very low returns, on par with CDs or some 
savings accounts at credit unions. Still, you do get a financial return on these 
without incurring any risk, and risk-free assets are the assets against which all 
other investments, considered risky assets, are compared. The risk-free rate is the 
annual return on a risk-free asset, so any investment that has more risk than the 
risk-free asset must also offer at least proportionally as much return. Otherwise, 
it’s in the best interest of the investor to buy only risk-free investments.
Determining the “right” amount of risk aversion
How much risk a corporation takes depends on how risk averse the investing 
manager of that corporation is. Many people are willing to take on far more addi-
tional risk just for the chance of generating a little bit of extra return. Some crazy 
people take on extra risk when they could generate just as much financial yield 
from a lower-risk investment. Some onlookers think that those individuals are 
addicted to the risk, kind of like compulsive gamblers. I’ll reserve judgment for 
the psychiatrists on that one, though.
Often the amount of risk aversion that a corporation has depends on its timeline. 
Portfolios with short-term goals are usually more risk averse because they have 
less time to make up for any losses. Long-term portfolios can ride out any losses 
from systematic risk by waiting for the economy to regain strength.
Measuring a company’s risk aversion
Exactly how do you measure an investor’s risk aversion? Well, simply asking 
investors wouldn’t work because saying “very averse” is a bit subjective, so it 
doesn’t help you mathematically.
You can measure how risk averse a particular corporation or investor is in a num-
ber of ways. Insurance agents like to measure risk aversion in terms of the total 
potential loss should the insured asset/person experience a worst-case scenario. 

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      207
Many financial advisors measure risk aversion in terms that don’t actually utilize 
a risk function, instead opting to utilize only their time horizon. They choose 
investments that will regain their value within a given time horizon should there 
be a sudden drop (it should come as no surprise that this approach is flawed). 
Those who simply seek to maximize returns for their client often take the average 
cyclical duration of investments into consideration; in order to avoid nearing the 
end of the portfolio time horizon during a recession, they gradually shift the focus 
of the portfolio toward less risky investments as the end gets closer.
Modern portfolio theory utilizes something called an aversion function. An aver-
sion function is measured by determining how much additional return a corpora-
tion must think is possible to be willing to take on just one additional unit of risk. 
Risk is measured, in this exercise, as the probability of loss (p), while (1 – p) is the 
probability that no loss will be experienced. This is true because 1 = 100 percent, 
and p is any number between 0 and 1. So, if p is 0.4, there’s a 40 percent chance of 
loss and a 60 percent chance (1 – 0.4) that no loss will be experienced. This strat-
egy is completely hypothetical, however, as a method of measuring risk aversion.
In the extreme, a corporation that’s completely neutral to risk — in other words, 
willing to take on any amount of risk for additional gain — has a risk aversion of 
0. This is often true for extremely low-risk assets, such as the difference between 
a Treasury bill and a Treasury note. A risk aversion of less than 0 means taking on 
additional risk without the expectation of additional gain, which is insane.
So, as a simple matter, the aversion function is a curved line that measures how 
much additional return must be generated for a single unit of additional risk. The 
function changes depending on how much risk the corporation has already 
incurred, but is measured by dividing the percentage change in expected returns 
required by the corporation to take on a percentage change in risk.
Another way to measure risk aversion is in terms of the risk premium demanded 
by an investor. Mathematically, it looks like this:
A
E r
 r
m
f
/
m
where
A = Risk aversion
E(rm) = Expected returns on risky assets required to attract the investor
rf = Rate of return on risk-free assets
σm = The amount of risk in risky assets (the actual measure of risk is highly debated, 
but I talk more about that in the next section, “Measuring risk”)

208      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
This method provides more of a spot ratio of risk aversion rather than the dynamic 
one provided in the previous method. Folks who are mathematically inclined 
combine the best of both methods.
Measuring risk
The actual measurement of risk is a matter of significant disagreement, but the 
next sections look at the two primary approaches to measuring risk.
In modern portfolio theory, before you can begin managing a portfolio, you have 
to look at individual investments. Originally, this task was done using a calcula-
tion called the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The CAPM is now seen more as 
an unrealistic view of investing, but it’s still valid as a starting point of the purely 
rational and efficient upon which we can build better models.
The CAPM leads to the use of the arbitrage pricing theory (APT), which is more 
flexible and has gained more favor as a functional approach to quantifying port-
folio management.
In both cases, the goal is to assess whether an investment is worth purchasing by 
determining the rate of returns and the risk compared to the risk-free rate of 
return.
Capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
Take a quick look at the CAPM equation and hopefully that will clear up CAPM and 
APT a bit.

where:
Rs = the rate of return demanded to invest in a specific asset
rf = the rate of return on risk-free assets
βa = the level of risk on a specific asset
rm = the rate of return on a market portfolio (an investment portfolio that perfectly 
matches the investment market)
By subtracting the risk-free rate from the market rate of return (which is best 
accomplished by investing in an index portfolio that matches something like the 
S&P 500), you’re determining what market premium is being offered for investing 
in risky assets. In other words, the market premium is the amount of financial 

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      209
return you can generate by managing a market portfolio of risky assets instead of 
only risk-free assets. By multiplying the risk of just a specific asset, you’re calcu-
lating the risk premium being offered by a specific investment. Because investors 
want a return premium that’s higher than the risk-free rate, you add the risk-free 
rate back into the equation, and you get the rate of returns demanded by investors 
to entice them to purchase an investment under CAPM. Nice and simple, right? 
Well, not so much. The following sections present a couple considerations.
BETA
First, the risk symbol beta (β) is not actually a measure of risk. Simply put, the 
developers of CAPM just got that wrong. It’s actually a statistical measure of vol-
atility. What that means is that a particular investment can fluctuate far above 
normal market returns and still be considered high risk, even though it’s making 
huge gains compared to the market. Meanwhile, another investment can be con-
sistently only 0.01 percent under market returns and still be considered low risk, 
even though it’s losing value compared to the market. Beta is measured as follows:
[
(
)]
,
/
Cov r  r
s
m
m
2
Beta measures the amount that the value of an individual asset changes in response 
to a change in market value. Cov is short for covariance and refers to any move-
ment in one variable that is inherently linked to movement in another variable. 
Consider stocks for a moment. If the stock market increases by 10 percent and an 
individual stock increases in value 20 percent in response to the change in value 
of the stock market, then the beta of that particular stock is 2, or twice as volatile 
as the stock market itself.
So, beta doesn’t measure actual risk of loss at all; it just measures volatility. Beta 
is still useful, but only when used properly, which doesn’t include using it to mea-
sure risk. What this equation does allow you to do is better understand the move-
ments of an investment.
Figuring out the covariance alone tells you how much volatility in an investment 
is simply in response to market volatility, and how much of it is unique to that 
investment (the proportion of variance not accounted for by the covariance is 
unique to the investment). This knowledge allows you to predict volatility more 
accurately. When calculating beta, you can estimate the severity of the volatility 
that will occur. This factor can help corporations that participate in active portfo-
lio management determine when to buy and resell investments by helping to 
project how high or low the price of the investment will go. This calculation is 
exclusively for active portfolio management, though, where losses and gains can 
occur as a result of fluctuations that otherwise have no impact on the underlying 
value of the asset.

210      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Instead, measures of risk used by value investors (investors who focus on finding 
undervalued and overvalued assets) utilize primarily measures that compare 
accounting values to market prices. For example, in stocks, measures of risk 
include the balance sheet and a comparison of the book value to the current mar-
ket price as well as the book value per share to the market price per share.
»
» When an investment’s price is higher than its value, it’s considered overpriced, 
making it more likely to lose value.
»
» When the investment’s price is lower than its value, it’s considered 
underpriced.
This analysis is done in conjunction with assessments of the quality of the under-
lying asset of the investment, in order to ensure that the market truly is overpric-
ing or underpricing rather than anticipating qualitative traits, such as amazing 
management.
The exact methods used to determine risk vary from investor to investor. People 
don’t like to talk about their methods because it gives away a “priority secret.” 
But it’s not that big a secret, really. It’s all about value versus price, and all the 
information used by top investors is in this book, just used in proprietary ways. 
Test some things out and see what works best for you. Because measures of risk 
are used in far more than just CAPM, I do suggest knowing this stuff. There will 
be a test at the end of this book — a test called “life”!
ASSUMPTIONS OF PERFECTION
No one is claiming that CAPM is perfect. Quite the opposite; CAPM is imperfect 
because to be functionally useful it requires several assumptions of perfect data. 
Nobody has a perfect market portfolio. Not everyone has perfect access to infor-
mation nor do all investments provide returns perfectly to a level of risk. CAPM 
ignores factors of behavioral finance, and it assumes that all returns above market 
returns will be lost in the long run and that the distribution of returns in a market 
portfolio is statistically perfect (for those statistically inclined, CAPM assumes a 
normal distribution of returns). Basically, CAPM assumes that everything in the 
world of corporate finance adheres to the lessons of beginning statistics and 
finance classes. That’s simply not how the world works, though.
So, why do I even talk about CAPM? More than anything, it’s a starting point. 
Nothing is wrong with assuming that everything in the world works perfectly and 
is easy to understand. You just have to modify the model to better reflect reality in 
order to make the model useful. Learning CAPM is kind of like putting training 
wheels on your bike. They help you understand how riding a bike is supposed to 
work, but you really haven’t learned to ride a bike until you take those training 

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      211
wheels off. All these assumptions we make that allow CAPM to work are your 
training wheels, and the training wheels are about to come off!
Arbitrage pricing theory
Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) is far more flexible and effective than CAPM. Instead 
of worrying about returns on a market portfolio, APT looks for differentials in the 
market price of a single investment and what the market price of the same invest-
ment actually should be. You can think of it in terms of volatility measures, sim-
ilar to the way beta should be used. The expected returns on an investment change 
in response to other factors and the sensitivity that the investment has to that 
factor.
»
» When the price of an investment is lower than the price predicted by the 
model, you should purchase it because the prediction is that it’s undervalued 
and will generate more value or increase in value in the future.
»
» When the price of an investment is higher than the price predicted by the 
model, the investment is considered overvalued, and you should sell it.
Use the proceeds of the sale either to purchase an investment whose market to 
expected price differential is negative (meaning that the market price is below the 
expected price) or to purchase risk-free investments until you find such an 
opportunity.
The model itself is very easy to understand and just as easy to customize, which is 
nice. Take a look at a sample model:
R
r
s
f
n n

r
r

where
Rs = The return on a specific investment
rf = The return on risk-free investments
β = The change in returns in response to a change in a variable
r = The variable that influences returns on an investment
ε = An error variable that accounts for temporary market deviations and shocks
In CAPM, beta measures the amount of change in value that an investment expe-
riences in response to a change in the market. In APT, beta actually measures 
something similar: It measures the amount of change in returns caused in 
response to a change of a particular variable. That variable can be interest rates, 
the cost of oil, GDP, annual sales, changes in market value, or anything else that 

212      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
influences the returns on an investment. It’s a little bit like guess-and-check. You 
try out different factors to determine whether changes in that factor correlate 
with changes in the value of the returns in an investment. If an investment’s price 
is low compared to the price estimated by the model, it’s a good investment to 
make.
Note that this model doesn’t really take risk into consideration at all. That’s 
because it’s not using measures of probability to determine the value of the 
investment. Rather, it’s looking for differences in value between the current mar-
ket price and the calculated market value. That being the case, the only risk to be 
concerned with is systematic market risk; the state of being over- or undervalued 
has already been established rather than relying on probabilities of risk.
The variable ε is a catch-all variable that refers to the amount of statistical error 
in the valuation model you’ve built. It’s meant to account for short-term varia-
tions in the value of an investment. It’s impossible to perfectly identify every 
variable that has an influence on risk or value, and that’s where ε gets its own 
value.
APT and CAPM both rely heavily on changes in risk in response to a specific vari-
able, both utilize the beta function to measure that risk (though in slightly differ-
ent ways), and both calculate returns over the risk-free rate. In contrast to each 
other, APT doesn’t have the same shortcomings of relying on impossible assump-
tions, but APT also doesn’t illustrate the variable of risk. Risk, in the context of 
investing, does exist. Of course, APT is flexible enough to include such a variable.
Optimizing Portfolio Risk
Collections of individual assets interact together to influence the overall portfolio. 
So, when several investments are lumped together in a portfolio, every single 
investment has an influence on the portfolio. Think of it like this: Envision a ring 
that’s held up by several rubber bands tied to it. Each rubber band acts like a single 
investment, so that the location of the ring in the middle is determined by the 
length of each rubber band. Now, if you pull on one of those rubber bands, the ring 
doesn’t move as much as the rubber band because the ring is still being held 
somewhat in place by the other rubber bands. That’s a bit how individual invest-
ments influence a total ring . . . I mean, portfolio.

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      213
Reaching the efficient frontier
Figure  15-1 illustrates something called the efficient frontier. The linear line 
labeled “Best possible CAL” illustrates the best potential proportion of returns to 
risk. CAL stands for capital allocation line, which means that any optimized portfo-
lio will fall on that line. The contradiction is that the individual assets will not fall 
on that line, so you have to use diversification of your portfolio to make it happen. 
Because investments that change value in opposite directions reduce risk below 
the risk of any individual asset through diversification, it’s possible to decrease 
the total risk of a portfolio, shifting it to the left, at any given rate of return.
The efficient frontier is the maximum amount of returns that can be generated for 
a given level of risk in a portfolio. The portfolio is optimized at the point of tan-
gency, where the efficient frontier intersects the best possible CAL using a given 
investment portfolio. The dot where the lines intersect in Figure 15-1 shows the 
point of an optimized portfolio generated using the individual investments illus-
trated by the solid dots.
How can you ensure that you’re doing this, though? How can you measure these 
influences that individual investments have on the risk and return of the whole 
portfolio? Again, you use math!
According to CAPM, you measure the returns of a portfolio like this:

m
k k

214      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
This equation says that the returns on a portfolio are the sum of the returns of the 
individual investments weighted by the proportion of their contribution to the 
portfolio. Here’s a quick example to illustrate. Assume the following facts about 
Investments A, B, and C:
Investment A: 10 percent returns, 50 percent portfolio
Investment B: 5 percent returns, 25 percent portfolio
Investment C: 0 percent returns, 25 percent portfolio
So, you calculate the returns on the portfolio like this:
10
0 5

0 25
0
0 25

volatility rather than actual risk) like this:

This equation works just like the portfolio returns under CAPM, except it uses the 
weighted sum of covariances of the individual investments. In contrast, the port-
folio variability under APT is calculated as follows:
w i
i
Once again, you use the sum of weighted variability, but this time you measure the 
variability of the individual factors influencing the individual investments. Doing 
this calculation allows you to input the value into another equation that measures 
the portfolio returns under APT:
r
E r
p

Here, the returns on the portfolio are the expected portfolio returns while also 
accounting for the portfolio variability and any short-term market shocks that 
influence price.
Innovating risk management
Yes, I know, it’s a lot of math. The question becomes whether all this math is 
worth the effort or whether you should simply invest in a passively-managed 
index portfolio that matches an asset index (there are indices of stocks, bonds, 
derivative investments, and all sorts of stuff).
The truth is that the vast majority of portfolios consistently generate fewer returns in 
the long run than index-matched portfolios. If anyone were to develop and announce 
a better method of portfolio management than the efficient market hypothesis, the 

CHAPTER 15  Through the Looking Glass of Modern Portfolio Theory      215
rest of the market would adopt the new method, eliminating the ability of the inven-
tor to continue making money using that method. So, it should come as no surprise 
that anyone who has a better method isn’t going to tell you about it.
A big part of professional portfolio management that allows some investors to 
generate above-normal returns has come from technology. Asset trades are now 
measured in milliseconds, so that the person with the fastest automated transac-
tions is able to generate the most returns by simply making a purchase before the 
price is driven up by other investors or selling before the price is driven down. 
Although effective, this advantage speaks more to these investors’ expertise in 
technology than in finance.
Another look at these above-normal returns in a portfolio shows that many of the 
successful portfolios actually lose their gains during an economic downturn. 
Remember that trade-off between risk and return? Well, investing is easy when 
the economy is growing because just about everything is doing well. Portfolio 
managers will take on extra risk to gain those extra returns, but when the econ-
omy starts to slump, all those gains disappear.
Market-driven slumps can be mitigated by carefully watching the national econ-
omy and taking the following precautions when indicators start pointing toward a 
downturn:
»
» Start buying options
»
» Start selling some of your portfolio
»
» Transition to lower-risk investments
»
» Continue to take risk by short-selling assets
In any case, it’s quite possible to avoid the loss that high-risk portfolios bring 
during a recession in contrast to the gains they make during an economic boom. 
But you need to take precautions and develop a keen mind for macroeconomics.
New innovations for portfolio management crop up all the time: new calculations, 
new models, new advances in mathematics and statistics, and new technologies. 
There are new and better ways to measure risk, find combinations of factors that 
influence APT calculations, and identify more accessible markets.
The overriding goal is to better utilize the synergy between assets to maximize the 
returns that corporate investments yield while limiting the amount of risk they’re 
exposed to. When you start talking about a corporation’s money (which is exactly 
what we’re talking about), tons of energy and resources go into finding new inno-
vations to generate better returns on investment, regardless of the type of assets 
in which the corporation is investing.

inancial engineering is nothing more than the creation of new and interest-
ing financial tools, often accomplished through the use of mathematic mod-
eling and computer engineering. Financial engineering is really where the 
majority of innovation is occurring in the field of finance. Financial engineering is 
a bit like the science lab of the world of corporate finance, where new ideas are 
developed and tested. These innovations may include new types of analytics, new 
investments, new debt, new transactions methods, new strategies, new types of 
accounts, and new ways for corporations to improve their financial efficiency and 
overall financial well-being — assuming, of course, that they know how to utilize 
the tools available to them.
In order to explain this field of financial engineering with all its broad, new, and 
often experimental activities, I break it down into some of the most common, 
most recent, and most successful trends to come from the last few decades.

Be careful when it comes to unique and exotic financial tools and products. If you 
are not certain about what you are doing, ask an expert (that doesn’t include the 
person trying to sell you something). A good rule of thumb is to avoid any finan-
cial products that you can’t calculate the value and risk of yourself.
Making Securities Out of Anything
When people talk about securities, more frequently than not, they are referring to 
equity securities, also known as stocks. Equity securities aren’t even close to being 
the only type of security out there, though. Securities include any financial invest-
ment that derives its value from an underlying asset. So, while stocks are a type of 
security whose value is derived from the ownership in a corporation that’s also 
changing in value, bonds derive their value from underlying assets, as do mutual 
funds and derivatives. With that in mind, people can make securities out of just 
about anything.
Securitization is the creation of new forms of securities, or new classifications of an 
existing security, based on some asset that currently has value or future value but 
in which no one is yet investing. The goal is to raise funds and distribute risk to a 
group of people seeking risk. You can do this with just about anything that has 
value. That’s securitization, and it’s a common trend in financial engineering.
Consider the role of commodities trading. Although it isn’t considered a form of 
financial engineering, it helps illustrate what securitization is. In commodity 
trading, brokers act as intermediaries between producers and processors or retail-
ers, usually for agricultural goods and natural resources, though a number of 
other things are also included.
Take coffee, for example. Say that coffee growers want to lock in a price: They 
want to sell 20 tons of coffee for $X per ton, so they get in touch with their broker, 
who writes up 20 derivatives contracts (usually either as options or futures). Each 
of these contracts now has the value of 1 ton of coffee, the dollar value of which 
will change depending on how the market price of coffee changes. The contract 
can be bought and resold multiple times until its delivery date, at which point the 
holder of the contract has to purchase the coffee for the price listed in the con-
tract. The contract itself is the security, whereas the coffee is the underlying asset.
You can securitize everything
If people can securitize things like coffee, gold, and businesses, then why can’t 
they securitize everything? The answer: They can! One of the trends in financial 

CHAPTER 16  Financially Engineering Yourself Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole      219
engineering is to find assets that have value and securitize them, developing 
securities that derive their value from that asset.
Probably the most successful development in securitization, as measured by the 
popularity of its use, is the mortgage-backed security (MBS). An MBS starts out 
with the banks; they issue mortgages just like any normal bank. The future cash 
flows on those mortgage loans are considered an asset now, because the bank will 
receive repayments from the borrower both for the principal balance as well as the 
interest payments. The banks then sell securities that use those future cash flows 
as the underlying asset. The banks sell the securities for cash to investors, and 
then repay the investors using the future cash flows on the mortgages. The inves-
tors generate a return on investment, and the banks use the capital raised from 
selling the securities to reinvest and increase the current value of future cash 
flows from the increased number of mortgages issued.
Alternatively, MBSs are a way for banks, particularly smaller ones, to limit their 
exposure to risk by issuing loans. Because a mortgage that goes into default  
doesn’t continue to generate cash flows, the holder of the MBS is the one who 
loses value on the investment should a mortgage default, not the bank. By selling 
mortgage loans to the investment market in the form of MBSs and thereby dis-
tributing the risk among a larger group of people, banks can reduce their own risk 
exposure on these loans. (In these MBSs, multiple mortgages are bundled together 
into a single security called a pass-through certificate, but I get into more detail on 
that in the section “Bundling Assets.”)
Sounds great, but as with most new financial products, new risks abound. This 
distribution of risk in the form of MBSs also helped to distribute the risk of sub-
prime mortgages to a larger variety of banks, making the mistakes of a smaller 
number of banks harm a wider range of other banks and investors. The harm done 
was much worse and far more widespread than it otherwise would have been.
Imagine, for a moment, the possibilities for securitization. What things do you 
come into contact with that have some sort of future value or sustained current 
value? What about a manufacturing firm? Rather than issuing debt to purchase a 
machine, the firm might sell securities on the future cash flows generated by sell-
ing the products that the machine makes and repay investors using the profits. If 
the company goes out of business, the products are bad, or the machine breaks, 
then the risk is distributed to the investment market in the same manner as  
mortgage-backed securities.
Slicing securities into tranches
Financial engineering has taken securitization even further, dividing individual 
securities into classes, called tranches, of investments that have varying 

220      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
repayment periods. This strategy varies the amount of interest-rate risk associ-
ated with each tranche and attracts a wider range of investors to a single security.
With mortgage-backed securities, for example, this division is a special class 
called collateralized mortgage obligations, and the tranches are classified by class: A, 
B, and C. Investors in each class receive their portion of the interest payments for 
as long as their portion of the principal isn’t yet paid off. Regarding the principal, 
Class A shares receive their repayment first, then B, and finally C. So, although 
Class C shareholders will receive more interest payment over the long run, they’re 
also accepting a higher degree of risk that interest rates will exceed the payments 
they’re currently receiving. The Class A tranche has the lowest risk but receives 
repayment over a shorter period of time. The class that investors choose depends 
greatly on their level of risk avoidance as well as their current portfolio strategy 
needs.
Splicing Hybrids
A hybrid is anything that is made by combining two or more things. Hybrid cars, 
for instance, are cars that run part of the time on an electric engine and part of the 
time on a standard combustion engine (in other words, they’re part electric car 
and part normal car).
More relevant to corporate finance, if you take two financial products and splice 
them together, you can form a whole new product. Some work more effectively 
together than others; sometimes the traits of each component of the hybrid func-
tion separately, not creating any benefit other than having two financial products 
rather than one.
The more successful hybrids are those where the traits of each component com-
plement each other in some way. The following sections take a look at some 
examples of hybrid financial products.
The mixed-interest class of hybrids
Whether you’re talking about investments (for example, bonds, money markets, 
annuities, or any other income-generating investment) or loans (such as mort-
gages, business loans, credit cards, and so on), these mixed-interest hybrids 
combine aspects of both fixed-rate and variable-rate financial products. A mixed-
rate bond, for example, guarantees a minimum rate of return that also matches 
interest rates if they go over a certain level, giving you the best of both a variable- 
and fixed-rate bond. A typical mixed-rate bond may include a minimum  

CHAPTER 16  Financially Engineering Yourself Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole      221
guaranteed fixed 3 percent interest rate with the potential to increase above  
3 percent if interest rates rise above that level. This sort of hybrid interest rate is 
partially pegged to some other indicator, such as interest rates or some index.
Another type of mixed-rate is time-dependent. Many mixed-rate mortgages 
include something called teaser-rates, wherein the interest on a mortgage remains 
fixed for a period of time before switching to a variable rate. These types of mort-
gages have come under fire recently as a form of bait-and-switch, hidden in a 
mountain of legal and financial jargon. They can be quite beneficial under the 
right circumstances, but the reality is that these circumstances can be extremely 
difficult for even professionals to predict, much less someone who’s less versed in 
financial modeling and forecasting. For example, a circumstance wherein one 
expects interest rates to fall in the future would benefit someone considering a 
time-dependent mixed-rate loan. Still, a market exists for these types of loans, 
even if it’s smaller than many lenders would like to believe.
Single asset class hybrids
In addition to hybrids that mix fixed- and variable-rate investments and loans, 
hybrids combine different types of a single asset class:
»
» Convertible bonds are bonds that have the option to be converted into a fixed 
number or value of shares of common stock.
»
» Convertible preferred shares of stock also have the option to be converted into a 
fixed number or value of shares of common stock per share of stock. This 
form of hybrid doesn’t provide the same sort of simultaneous benefits of each 
component as other forms of hybrids do, but the option to choose which 
traits you have available to you in your investing is still a valuable benefit for 
strategic and portfolio investing.
Furthermore, a number of hybrids combine completely different types of asset 
classes. Packaging different types of investments together with options, either 
call or put, is a particularly popular option. In cases of equity, debt, and even 
money market investments, hybrid investments are now available that include, by 
default, put options that allow you to sell your investment at a given rate or price.
Contracts are available to purchase an asset with a call option to purchase more on 
or before a certain date at a given price. These vehicles can be particularly useful 
for people managing strategic investment portfolios, which often supplement 
with risk-hedging strategies. They’re also quite handy as stand-alone invest-
ments for corporations that are more risk averse than the underlying investment 
alone can accommodate.

222      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Indexed-back CDs
One hybrid investment utilizes several of the previous hybrids I discussed to cre-
ate something of a chimera; something that has been combined with so many dif-
ferent things that it barely resembles its original form anymore. This is called the 
index-backed CD with a put option hybrid.
To create this monstrosity, you start with a standard certificate of deposit, which 
is a timed deposit that works similar to a savings account, except that it includes 
an obligation to maintain the principal balance for a minimum period of time. 
Now, combine that with a variable-rate security that’s pegged to an equity index, 
so that the interest rate floats with the index. Now, tack on a put option that 
allows the investors to sell their stake in the CD for a set return that’s usually 
based on the present value.
This particular investment shows that the development of new forms of hybrid 
financial tools is just beginning, and that new types of transactions that no longer 
resemble anything known today may easily evolve from these innovations. Like 
securitization, this trend in financial engineering is only just beginning.
Bundling Assets
Not all combinations of investments are hybrids (see the preceding section). When 
several of a single type of asset or, sometimes, several different types of assets are 
grouped together and sold collectively as a single security, that’s called bundling.
Bundling has come to have a unique role in corporate finance since the start of the 
21st century. The act of bundling involves taking several different assets and 
lumping them together in something called an asset pool with a nominal value 
equivalent to the sum of the values of the individual assets included. The issuer 
takes the total value of the assets or their future cash flows and sells equity backed 
by this value wherein either ownership in the asset itself or its cash flows will 
generate returns. The source of derived value is similar to that of a stock or a bond, 
respectively.
The thing that makes bundling significantly different from standard securitiza-
tion is the matter of risk. The risk adjusted value is higher than the sum of the 
individual assets. Because bundling, by its very nature, creates a certain amount 
of inherent diversification within the security (if one of the assets in the pool fails, 
others are still valid), the risk of the bundle must be measured as a unique set in 
itself. This is done by classifying each individual asset by its risk level, and then 
taking the weighted average of the different classifications present within the 
bundle.

CHAPTER 16  Financially Engineering Yourself Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole      223
Pass-through certificates
Easily the most common example of bundling for a single type of asset is some-
thing called a pass-through certificate. Sold by mortgage lenders, these securities 
derive their value from the future cash flows generated as borrowers pay back 
their mortgages. So, the lender issues several mortgages, bundles them together 
into an asset pool, and sells securities to raise money and distribute the risk asso-
ciated with that asset pool to the investment community. Investors earn returns 
by receiving long-term payments in the form of principal and interest repay-
ments. The process isn’t all that different from securitization except you’re creat-
ing securities out of an aggregate of assets rather than a single asset.
In a pass-through certificate, the credit risk level of each individual mortgage is 
classified in a manner similar to the way Moody’s or the S&P measures the risk of 
bonds (see Chapter  11 for more on bonds). The credit ratings of the individual 
assets are then used to develop a weighted average risk for the entire portfolio. 
Here’s an example:
Sample simple pass-through: A, A, A, B, C
Weighted average risk: B+
Multi-asset bundles
Another, slightly different, form of bundling includes bundling multiple, different 
types of assets together. Mutual funds are a common example of this type of bun-
dling, because they frequently group together different types of equities, bonds, 
and other forms of assets into a single pool. Investors then purchase shares of 
ownership in the mutual fund itself. As opposed to a hedge fund, where people 
give their money to someone who then manages their cash as a pool, mutual funds 
are pools of assets in which people invest.
Because the risk of each individual asset in these multi-asset bundles (compared 
to single-asset bundling) isn’t measured in the same way, nor does each asset 
often have the same type of risk, the risk of these bundles is measured a bit dif-
ferently. These bundles are very similar to investment portfolios; in a way, they’re 
investment portfolios that have been securitized. As a result, the most effective 
method to assess the risk of these bundles is to measure them the same way you 
would an investment portfolio.

224      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Unbundling
Another innovation related to bundling comes into play when a single security is 
broken into several different securities, in a process called unbundling. This term 
usually refers to the process by which the cash flows from a single security, such 
as a bond, are broken apart and each is sold as a different security.
For example, a coupon bond that makes interest coupon payments as well as prin-
cipal repayment at maturity can be broken into several different types of securi-
ties. The issuer can bundle the individual coupon payments into a single security 
to be sold on its own, while the principal repayment at maturity is sold separately. 
Each security is treated as a separate investment with its own valuation, pricing, 
cash flows, and ability to be sold and resold; but both securities derive their value 
from the same underlying asset — a single bond or pool of cash flows from cou-
pons or principal repayments.
This form of unbundling is still lagging in popularity compared to bundling, 
though it holds just as much potential to be applied to any sort of investment that 
generates cash flows over time. The cash flows from a single mortgage can be 
unbundled, not only by the types of cash flows, as with unbundled bonds, but also 
with regard to their repayment periods. This process makes several new types of 
investments from a single mortgage, each with a differing level of risk not only 
from credit risk, but also from interest-rate risk: The longer the repayment period 
on the security, the higher the interest-rate risk.
Exploring Exotics
Exotic financial products aren’t entirely new; rather, they’re new and/or rare 
variations of existing products. The word exotic is used in finance in the sense that 
something is attractive simply because it’s out of the ordinary. On the flip side, 
“ordinary” products are popular because they appeal to a larger market. The 
exotic products being developed through financial engineering are rare and 
extraordinary in large part because they appeal to only a small market of people 
who not only have much more practice in financial management, but also have 
unique needs.
Just because an asset or investment is available doesn’t mean you need it. The 
attraction that people have to something that’s novel — even if they won’t benefit 
from having it or even if they don’t have a particular use for it — is one of those 
bizarre behaviors in the world of finance that causes otherwise rational, and 
sometimes quite experienced, people to act like excited beginners. Still, these are 
great products that fill a need for a number of roles in the financial world, and 

CHAPTER 16  Financially Engineering Yourself Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole      225
even if they’re designed to fill only that role, they may inspire others to model 
new products off of them to fill other roles.
The point is this: Exotic doesn’t necessarily mean useful; it just means exotic. The 
following sections touch on some of the strange and exotic financial wildlife that 
exist in the laboratory of financial engineering.
Options
The derivatives market, which is based nearly entirely on contracts that can be 
customized as long as there is a legal agreement between the issuer and the 
holder, has been rife with the development of exotic financial tools. A number of 
unusual options, for example, have been developed. Options are available that are 
dependent on some milestone occurring before the option expires but after it’s 
issued. Some options only become valid if the price of the underlying asset drops 
below a certain level, whereas others become invalidated if they drop below that 
level. The same can be said for some options that either become valid or invalid if 
they rise above a certain level. The value of some options depends not on the final 
stock price on the expiration date, but, rather, on either the maximum or mini-
mum price achieved while the option was “in play.” The value of some options 
varies depending on different macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment 
rates, the balance of trade, or any of a number of indicators, such as the gross 
domestic product (GDP).
Swaps contracts
Options aren’t the only derivative that have seen unusual variations. The value of 
swaps contracts varies not with the value of the underlying asset or even in 
response to variations in some indicator, but in response to the level of variation 
itself. Variance swaps derive their value from the amount of volatility experienced, 
called a variance strike. Forward contracts (see Chapter 13 for more on this topic) 
are customized by their very nature (in contrast to futures, which are standard-
ized). As a result, forward contracts can become unique to the point where you 
may see a particular variation only once, depending on what the two parties to the 
contract agree upon. Indexed-principal swaps have their principal value (rather 
than — or in addition to — their interest payments) vary with some index, usually 
inflation or interest rates. Other unique swaps have included foreign exchange 
swaps, but they’ve come under fire as some banks have been sued for misleading 
claims.

226      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Loans
The development of exotic financial products is not just limited to derivatives, 
though. A number of loans are becoming more exotic as well.
Some lenders are advertising interest-only loans, which have extremely low initial 
repayment rates because borrowers are only paying back the interest without 
chipping away at the principal balance. Repayment of the principal comes after a 
specified period of time, at which point payments increase dramatically.
Another type of loan, called a negative-amortization loan, requires borrowers to pay 
less than their interest payments at first, instead deferring those payments back 
into the principal loan and thereby increasing the amount they must pay back in 
the long run when repayment costs jump.
Loans are available with repayment costs that are variable, instead of or including 
a variable interest rate. This type of loan is common in many places in the world, 
but in the United States it’s pretty much limited to certain types of federally-
backed student loans.
Engineering Finances
Portfolio engineering and investing strategy go hand-in-hand and are easily the 
most mathematically complicated subject in all of financial engineering. As Isaac 
Newton pointed out, modeling the madness of men is more difficult than model-
ing the movement of the planets. He was entirely correct, and portfolio engineer-
ing is an extreme example of how this is true. As a result, I’m not going to talk 
about any of the math used. Instead, I’m going to talk about how they use the 
calculations once they’re done to arrange portfolios according to different 
strategies.
Portfolio engineering is all about developing models and strategies that utilize 
combinations of assets to maintain a certain percentage return on investment. A 
wider variety of investments are typically utilized — including equities and debt, 
bundled and hybrid investments — but they’re almost always derivatives of some 
sort. The intent is to ensure a certain amount of return on investment. Some of the 
early portfolio strategies including options have colorful names such as covered 
call, protective put, straddle, iron condor, collar, strangle, and ironfly. Many futures 
strategies focus greatly on generating revenue off the spread.

CHAPTER 16  Financially Engineering Yourself Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole      227
More and more corporations are beginning to move away from these simple strat-
egies, however, and are moving toward the use of algorithms to determine finan-
cial transactions and strategies for the development of portfolios. These algorithms 
are often based in stochastic calculus, which, when applied to mathematical finance, 
sets out to estimate and predict time intervals of asset prices by treating them as 
a random variable. (See the nearby sidebar.)
FINANCIAL ENGINEERING
I don’t get into the mathematics of financial engineering because it often involves highly 
advanced probability and calculus, which are well beyond the scope of this book, but 
here are a few things worth knowing:
•	 These algorithms are widely varied and highly customizable for the people imple-
menting them. A very large number of algorithms and other models is available, 
each with varying degrees of success and intended for varying purposes.
•	 These algorithms are used primarily by active portfolio managers to take advantage 
of very fast and very small variations in pricing. They are used to generate revenues 
by quickly buying and reselling assets. As such, they’re more related to market and 
human behaviors than to the actual value of the assets.
•	 These algorithms don’t consider the price or value of an asset as much as they con-
sider the interval of variation that occurs in the price of assets. For instance, one 
algorithm may prescribe buying any asset that experiences a 5 percent price drop 
within any period of time less than one minute. It doesn’t matter what the value of 
the asset was or what the price is, just that this time-dependent price interval indi-
cates, according to the algorithm, that the price will increase by some interval range 
in the future.
•	 Many of these algorithms are adaptive or evolutionary. In other words, they auto-
matically adapt to new trends and become increasingly complex over time. This 
adaptation is possible because as more data becomes available over time, it’s con-
tinuously added to the equation in order to incorporate additional patterns, trends, 
and other data and increase its responsiveness to future changes and its ability to 
predict movements.
Again, unless you’re a seasoned mathematician, don’t even worry about how this math 
works. You’d have an easier time doing the calculations related to space travel than 
financial modeling. Even Isaac Newton saw that one coming.

228      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
On May 6, 2010, the stock market experienced something called a flash crash, 
where the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index lost nearly 10 percent 
of its entire value almost instantly and then regained that value in just minutes. It 
was caused by the use of automated algorithms as a form of portfolio manage-
ment. Modern portfolio management is done, in very large part, automatically as 
managers preset computer algorithms that are designed to take specific actions if 
specific milestones are reached. For example, they may automatically buy or sell a 
certain amount of shares of any stock that changes in value to meet specific crite-
ria, depending on the current moment’s value of other assets already in the port-
folio. Again, this strategy is all determined using mathematical models. So, when 
one algorithm triggered a sell-off of a particular quantity and type of asset, that 
triggered other algorithms to also sell certain things, and the entire thing became 
a chain reaction, like dominos being knocked over. As prices dropped so low, those 
managers aware of what was occurring took the opportunity to buy up the under-
valued assets, and at some point the algorithms eventually triggered a repurchase, 
driving up price again.
This example illustrates two trends in financial engineering. It’s true that the 
phenomenon was primarily caused by the use of automated mathematical model-
ing, making it an issue of portfolio engineering, but it could not have happened 
without the use of advances in computer engineering that allow for such things as 
high-frequency trading and automated responses to occur.
Moving into Computational Finance
The most significant trend in the manner in which financial transactions take 
place and the financial implications of this change comes from an overlap between 
financial engineering and computer engineering, called computational finance. 
Portfolio engineering and computerization have become very closely intercon-
nected. As the calculations related to financial decision-making are becoming 
ever more complex, doing them manually is no longer efficient. Instead, the pro-
cess has been automated. The financial management is more related to computer 
programming, and pre-setting action triggers is more related to the portfolio 
strategy than to actual trading.
That’s only one aspect of computerization, however. In addition to portfolio man-
agement, computerization has also significantly changed the dynamic of trade as 
a whole, changing how transactions take place. The manner of transactions has 
changed, and so have the methods used in order to gain an advantage. Those 
methods are now focused on the nature of computing.

CHAPTER 16  Financially Engineering Yourself Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole      229
The success of financial managers is increasingly becoming intrinsically linked 
with their computer skills. Every corporation should absolutely be linking its 
finance and IT departments, regardless of the range and scope of their financial 
functions. More than anything, this aspect of financial engineering has com-
pletely reshaped the world of finance, and this trend inevitably will continue to 
have implications for all corporations around the world. Those who don’t adapt 
are destined to get spanked by their competition.
Financial engineering is about continuously assessing the current methods and 
finding new methods in order to gain an advantage, increase returns, and cus-
tomize products. People are very serious about their money and will stop at noth-
ing to revolutionize the world in order to make more. Financial engineering is a bit 
like the science lab of the finance world.
Changing the face of trading
With regard to corporate investments, nearly every aspect except capital invest-
ments and the setting of strategies is done by computers now. The stereotypical 
image of the trading floor of any stock exchange is ancient history, as the trading 
floors are now set up with rows or circles of computers where all exchanges take 
place. The shouting matches between traders are rare and becoming extinct. This 
shift to e-trading has opened the door for amateurs, casual traders, retirees, and 
just about anyone else on the planet to become nearly as effective as the profes-
sionals. Not only do they have access to fast transactions using some of the same 
networks, or at least similar ones, but these transactions are very cheap. Discount 
brokers often charge less than $10 per transaction, and people no longer have to 
go through a professional for these transactions to take place; it’s all done on the 
computer now.
Computerization has very much changed what makes a trader competitive com-
pared to others. Traders and portfolio managers are now becoming more compet-
itive based on the effectiveness of their automated algorithms and the speed of 
their computer network. The speed of orders and trades is measured in millisec-
onds as traders attempt to ensure that they’re the first to get their orders through, 
before other automated systems have a chance to drive up or down the price of a 
particular asset. Those who are fastest can take advantage of this by instanta-
neously reselling at the higher or lower price, making extremely high-volume 
trades within seconds of each other and generating revenue by doing this seem-
ingly countless times throughout each day.

230      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Banking from beyond
The scope of computerization extends beyond corporate investing. It’s rare to find 
a bank or credit union that doesn’t offer free online banking, transfers, and 
bill-pay. Not only does this make banking much faster but also cheaper.
One of the services that’s available as a result of computerization is automated 
bill-pay and invoicing — one of the few services in which a corporation would not 
want to participate. Consider a corporation that makes thousands of purchases 
each month, or even just a few very expensive purchases consistently. It can pay 
the bill immediately, as automated bill-pay sometimes requires, or it can wait 
until the very last moment to pay the bill in order to keep the money in an account 
that generates interest.
Now reverse this scenario: A corporation is owed money, and the sooner it gets its 
payment, the sooner it can begin to generate interest. Of course, there’s a conflict 
of interest and no vendor can force its customers to pay before the due date. The 
vendor can, however, benefit by offering automated bill-pay to its customers, 
while neglecting to automate bill-pay itself or ensuring that its automatic bill-pay 
is timed to make the transaction after a specified time interval. There may even be 
potential for services that provide intermediary automation that generates inter-
est off the spread between interest rates paid and received in short-term repay-
ments. Just a thought.
Building quantitative algorithms
Another trend in computerization is logic programming. This concept isn’t new at 
all. In fact, all computer programming is based in logic to some extent. Over time, 
the programs have become far more mathematical, however, and now these pro-
grams are starting to be used for such things as tax management and even execu-
tive management. Automated systems that either directly track a corporation’s 
PROJECT EXPRESS
Computerization and the speed of transactions is extremely lucrative. In 2013, a cable 
opened called Project Express. This is a fiber optic cable costing $300 million that con-
nects financial markets in New York and London. You may ask, “What kind of benefit 
would a $300 million cable for financial markets produce?” The answer: 5.2 milliseconds. 
That’s right; the speed of transactions increased by less than 1 second, and that’s worth 
far more than the cost of $300 million. Such is the nature of computerization in financial 
engineering.

CHAPTER 16  Financially Engineering Yourself Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole      231
financial activities or integrate with other financial computer systems make deci-
sions based on tax law or other more advanced algorithms related to business 
decision management.
As with most jobs, computerization and computer engineering is being applied to 
corporate finance at the functional level as well. Computers are supplementing or 
replacing multiple financial roles within corporations.
Here is a list of some of the more common financial software packages:
»
» Hyperion: Financial management
»
» JD Edwards: Several financial software packages
»
» Peachtree: Basic financial recording and reporting
»
» Quicken: More basic functions of recording, reporting, and invoicing
»
» ERP Financials: Comprehensive financial management
»
» SAS: Modeling and analytics
»
» STATA: Modeling and analytics
»
» SPSS: Statistical analytics
Because computerization is easily the most dynamic, comprehensive, and most 
quickly changing aspect of financial engineering, these software packages are 
prone to being outdated at any point. Still, most of them are well integrated into 
the financial community and have been around, in one form or another, for quite 
a while. For example, SPSS changed its name to PASW for a period of time, then 
changed it back when it was bought by IBM. This particular area of financial inno-
vation is quickly changing, and corporations must continuously review it in order 
to remain competitive.


CHAPTER 17  Weighing Capital      233
Chapter 17
Weighing Capital
C
ontrary to popular belief, not all debt is toxic. That’s the mindset of many 
consumers, which is understandable: When you use debt to make your pur-
chases, the interest you pay for those purchases represents a price distor-
tion. That’s considered a negative return on investment, because you’re overpaying 
for the value you get in return. On the other hand, when you borrow money to 
invest in a machine that allows you to turn a profit, that’s a good thing, as long as 
the return on investment is higher than the interest you pay on the loan.
Also contrary to popular belief, raising money by selling ownership of the com-
pany through initial public offerings of stock has costs associated with it. These 
costs affect those who have ownership in the company. You can’t simply be given 
money for the growth or continued operations of a company without expecting to 
pay for it in one manner or another.
The goal of this chapter is to explain costs that are involved in raising money for 
corporate purposes and discuss how to keep those costs to a minimum.
Calculating the Cost of Capital
The total cost of capital is the cost of debt plus the cost of equity. Much like the 
frame of a building, the capital structure of an organization is the fundamental 
part of finance upon which all other financial functions in a corporation rest. As a

structure

234      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
result, it’s vital to continually evaluate the health and management of that finan-
cial framework. You can evaluate your capital structure in two ways:
»
» Overall corporate application of the cost of capital: This helps the 
company determine how to manage the structure of its overall capital. How 
much of the required capital is funded using debt and how much using 
equity? What types of debt and equity do the company use? The answers to 
these questions can strongly influence how successful a company is, and you 
can answer these questions before a company even begins operations. The 
overall corporate capital structure refers to the total amount of company 
assets and how efficiently the company manages those assets as a whole.
»
» Project capital structure management: This evaluation is a little more 
focused. Before deciding whether to take on a new project, you need to 
determine the project’s cost and weigh the costs associated with raising those 
funds against the projected future cash flows that the project will generate. 
Based on the project’s total cash outflows and inflows, you can calculate the 
net present value of the project (see Chapter 10 for more on NPV), allowing 
corporations to determine the best of several possible projects available.
The best way to measure the costs associated with raising capital is to calculate 
the cost of capital. You can calculate the costs a number of different ways, and if 
you’re mathematically inclined, you will find it easy to play with this particular 
calculation to make adjustments as needed to meet personal preferences. This 
chapter explains the fundamental calculations of the cost of capital as well as how 
to apply the information in useful ways throughout this chapter.
Before getting into the details, here’s a simple calculation to quickly figure out the 
cost of capital:
Cost of Capital = Cost of Equity + Cost of Debt
The cost of debt comes primarily in the form of interest payments, which is very 
simple to measure and calculate. The cost of equity, meanwhile, comes from sev-
eral different sources and is a little harder to define. Part of the cost of equity 
comes down to dividend policy, particularly for preferred shares; part of it is the 
increased tax costs, and the risk of equity also plays a role. All are discussed in 
more detail throughout this chapter. Calculating the cost of capital allows you to 
not only determine how much you’re spending through your financing activities, 
but also where the cost is coming from (either equity or debt), the required mini-
mum returns necessary to stay profitable, and even how to manage the capital 
structure of your company to minimize the costs of capital.

CHAPTER 17  Weighing Capital      235
Measuring cost of capital, the WACC way
The most common method of measuring the cost of capital that you’ll see in all 
the major college finance textbooks is called WACC (pronounced “whack”): the 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital. This particular equation takes the same basic 
cost of capital equation and contributes the proportions of total corporate value 
that each source of capital composes.
The following equation should make WACC a little bit clearer:
WACC
E
V
C
D
V
C
E
D
You can do a number of additional things to this equation to account for variations 
in cash inflows, interest-rate differentials, inflation, tax rates, and so on. I’m not 
going to talk about all that, though, because I’m on a mission to discuss some-
thing else. For the time being, the important thing is that you look at how this 
equation works and why it’s important:
E = Market value of equity
D = Market value of debt
V = Company Value (book value of debt plus book value of equity)
C = Cost, either of equity (E) or debt (D)
So, what you’re looking at is just the same equation as the one to calculate the cost 
of capital (Cost of Capital = Cost of Equity + Cost of Debt), but with a twist. The 
(E/V) and (D/V) are simply weighted proportions. The market value of equity is 
divided by the total corporate value to determine how much of the corporation’s 
value is funded by equity, and you do the same calculation for debt. By calculating 
this equation, you’re actually calculating the cost of capital in the proportions of 
the sources of capital.
It’s a little bit like taking the debt-to-equity ratio and splitting it up among the 
cost of capital. Doing this is going to help you determine the proper capital struc-
ture for a corporation by helping to identify disproportionately high costs and 
finding out how to maximize returns by pursuing the sources of capital that will 
optimize the financial balance between debt and equity.
Factoring in the cost of debt
Calculating the cost of debt is pretty simple, so I don’t spend a ton of time on it. 
Debt includes any long- or short-term liability that is used to finance the opera-
tions of a business.

236      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
The biggest influence on the cost of debt is simply the interest rate on debt 
incurred, measured by using the current value of future cash flows to repay the 
loans. (See Chapters 9 and 11.) Well, in this chapter, you’re looking at the same 
thing from the perspective of corporate costs of debt rather than investor potential 
for debt. Still, if the time value of money was the only influence, you’d simply use 
the yield to maturity on all the corporation’s debt to determine the cost of debt.
You need to consider a number of issues, though:
»
» Default risk isn’t a direct cost, but a company must anticipate that, as the 
amount and proportion of debt it takes on increases, so, too, will the rate of 
return it must promise to attract investors increase. A corporation with high 
amounts of debt or a high debt-to-equity ratio is at greater default risk, so to 
attract more investors looking for debt, it must offer higher rates. As a result, 
debt becomes increasingly more expensive as the company relies on it 
more heavily.
»
» Debt expenses are very frequently tax-deductible, decreasing the relative 
cost of debt. To calculate the tax rate applicable for debt capital, you simply 
multiple the pre-tax rate by (1-marginal tax rate) to get the after-tax rate, 
which is obviously lower by an amount equal to the proportion deducted for 
tax purposes.
Looking at the cost of equity
The cost of equity is a little less singular than the cost of debt. Equity is any fund-
ing raised through the selling of stock. Different people have different ways of 
measuring equity.
Some people prefer to simply utilize the CAPM or some other form of APT (both 
explained in Chapter 15), estimating the cost of equity as an amount equivalent to 
the risk premium on returns paid by the corporation to its investors. In this man-
ner, any returns generated in excess of the risk-free rate will be deemed to be the 
cost of equity. This calculation is simple to use, but it also considers fluctuations 
in the value of shares on the secondary market, which really has no cost to the 
corporation. Needless to say, I’m not a fan of this method, but some people argue 
its benefits.
Another slightly different method is to include all dividend payments made by the 
corporation (because the risk-free rate still costs the company money) and then 
add to that amount the influence of share value dilution on treasury shares at the 
time of selling treasure shares or at the time of issuing an additional IPO. This 
method considers all cash outflows and all depreciated book value on the company 

CHAPTER 17  Weighing Capital      237
resulting from the decision to push extra shares of stock into the marketplace. At 
that point, investors can decide whether the returns they are generating are suf-
ficiently above the risk-free rate.
Share value dilution happens when a company issues additional stock, thus causing 
the proportion of ownership that current stockholders claim to go down.
Dividend policy
The corporation’s dividend policy heavily influences its cost of equity. When a 
company makes a profit, that profit technically belongs to the owners of the com-
pany, which are the stockholders. So, a company has two choices regarding what 
they can do with those profits:
»
» They can distribute them to the shareholders in equal payments per share of 
stock as dividends.
»
» They can reinvest them into the company as retained earnings.
In either case, those dividends increase the value of the shareholders, so for inves-
tors, in theory, it shouldn’t matter what the company’s dividend policy is. Either 
the retained earnings go to increase the book value of the company, or they 
increase the income of the shareholders, both in equal values.
This idea that dividend policy shouldn’t influence investor preference, yet does, is 
called the dividend puzzle, which evolved from the Modigliani-Miller Theorem. This 
theorem states that, in an efficient market, a corporation’s capital structure won’t 
influence firm value. Whether a company offers dividends to their investors or 
reinvests the money should hypothetically provide equivalent value to investors. 
This is just in theory, though, as the decision to offer dividends will change the 
costs associated with capital structure, as well as the marginal returns associated 
with using those retained earnings to grow the company. The result is puffed-up 
stock prices for dividend-issuing stocks.
Increased book value by retaining earnings doesn’t necessarily translate into 
increased share price. Retained earnings do not remain a stagnant value and do 
not necessarily generate additional income or value over time. Corporations do not 
always have a use for retained earnings, so the value of dividends will depend on 
the context of share price (for the investor) as well as total corporate book value 
(for the corporation deciding on their dividend policy). That’s where the study of 
dividend policy comes from — which approach to dividends will optimize corpo-
rate capital structure and maximize shareholder returns.

238      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
When deciding on dividend policy, corporations have a few options:
»
» Preferred cumulative dividends: Corporations have no choice but to pay 
these dividends eventually, so the influence of cumulative preferred shares of 
stock on capital structure must be anticipated even before issuing those 
shares. After the dividends are issued, the corporation must either pay them 
now or delay payment and pay them using earnings later. Even if the com-
pany doesn’t turn a profit one year, cumulative dividends are guaranteed and 
must be paid later. Delayed dividend payments are considered dividends in 
arrears until they’re paid, but they must be paid eventually unless the 
company goes out of business and uses all the funds generated from 
liquidation to pay their debts. These dividends always take priority, right  
after making all debt payments.
»
» Preferred noncumulative dividends: These dividends are paid after the 
cumulative shares get all their money first. Noncumulative preferred divi-
dends are paid in a similar manner as cumulative dividends and are “guaran-
teed” in the sense that they are paid anytime the company makes profits. 
However, if the company operates at a loss one year, these dividends won’t 
necessarily be paid. If these dividends aren’t declared (a term that means the 
official allocation of profits to pay a dividend, though the dividend hasn’t yet 
been paid), then they will be forfeited. In other words, use it or lose it. Like 
cumulative shares, these dividends have a guaranteed cost of capital assum-
ing that the corporation is successful.
»
» Common dividends: Common dividends have no guarantee. If any money 
remains after a company pays all its debt payments, the preferred sharehold-
ers get their dividends, the company determines its requirements for retained 
earnings, and then the common shareholders get the scraps as common 
dividends. The role of these dividends on the capital structure of a corpora-
tion will vary depending on how these dividends are managed. These 
dividends are easily the most flexible of dividends because they’re not 
guaranteed, which gives management the ability to most effectively deter-
mine whether to use profits to fund future projects and lower the costs of 
capital from equity. Using common dividends in this manner can even 
increase equity capital funding in the future. This approach attracts investors 
via increased total value compared to the total number of shares outstanding 
for which investors receive dividends, thereby providing higher dividends per 
share.
»
» Retained earnings: Retained earnings (the earnings, or profits, that are 
retained by the corporation) are those funds kept by the corporation to fund 
operations and growth. These earnings are generated after all preferred 
shareholders get their dividends. The corporation gets its share in retained 
earnings, and then the rest is given to common shareholders. Retained 
earnings is a very popular method of funding growth and operations because 

CHAPTER 17  Weighing Capital      239
it doesn’t increase debt costs nor does it devalue existing value as does the 
issuance of more equity, thereby increasing the cost of equity. Retained 
earnings aren’t always sufficient, however. In those cases, companies fund 
projects as much as possible with retained earnings and then pursue other 
forms of capital sourcing for the remainder. Still, growth simply for the sake of 
growth isn’t healthy either, so unless the corporation has a use for retained 
earnings, it should not incur the extra costs of growth without anticipated 
increases in revenues, obligating it to declare dividends on earnings.
GETTING WARREN BUFFETT’S TAKE
American investor Warren Buffett explains dividend policy as assessing whether the 
corporation or the shareholder can generate greater returns using the same amount of 
money. In other words, because the corporation doesn’t own the profits that it gener-
ates (the shareholders do), then it should look at profits as a source of capital funding 
similar to equity.
In deciding how to fund a future project, corporate growth, or operations, the future 
cash flows generated from retaining those earnings (total value generated by reinvest-
ing those earnings minus the costs associated with pursuing a new project or corporate 
growth) must be assessed against the average returns generated in market invest-
ments. If the corporation can generate more value for its investors by pursuing projects 
funded by retained earnings than the investors are likely to generate by reinvesting divi-
dends back into the market (or by reinvesting at the risk-free rate, depending on who 
you’re talking to), then the company should retain the earnings; otherwise, it should pay 
the dividend. This dividend will attract more investors, thereby maximizing the transla-
tion of value on profits to share price.
Buffett’s view is supported in a theory of dividend policy called Walter’s Model, wherein 
corporations that can generate returns using retained earnings greater than the cost of 
capital in funding operations should retain those earnings to give the shareholders 
greater value. This is also supported by Gordon’s Model, which considers the risk associ-
ated with longer-term investments, wherein dividend payments generate a realization 
of cash flows in the short term, decreasing the increased risk returns realized only in the 
long term as with retained earnings, thereby attracting more investors. In other words, 
Gordon’s Model takes a “bird in the hand” approach, whereby known dividends paid are 
worth more than potential equity gains from retained earnings, but Gordon’s Model 
tends to place too much weight on risk.

240      PART 4  A Wonderland of Risk Management
Regarding dividend policy, it’s important to note a couple of things:
»
» Dividends on common shares aren’t required to be paid, but if the corpora-
tion doesn’t intend to incur the extra costs associated with using retained 
earnings to expand the company, then any unused earnings must be paid as 
dividends. (Those profits have to go somewhere.)
»
» Even on preferred shares, dividends are guaranteed only on cumulative 
preferred shares. These are preferred shares that accumulate dividend 
payments over time if they’re not paid during the time promised, generating 
something called dividends in arrears. On noncumulative preferred shares, 
these dividends in arrears are dropped from the dividends-payables if they’re 
not declared. Most preferred shares are cumulative, however.
Choosing the Proper Capital Structure
From the corporation’s perspective, investing, debt, and equity all come back to 
the original question of how to fund its operations and how to properly balance 
the amount of debt or equity that is being used to raise capital. In other words,  
all this information is being used to manage the corporation’s capital structure.
The goal, in setting the corporation’s policies regarding capital structure, is to 
minimize the costs associated with raising capital. This means, when applicable, 
choosing the cheapest option for capital funding. If interest rates on debt are too 
high, then issuing equity may be the cheaper method. If issuing more equity gen-
erates more tax burden (or decreases the tax advantages of incurring debt, either 
for the corporation or for the shareholders in a manner that causes the market 
value of shares to drop), generates greater dividend payments, or too greatly 
influences existing shares in a negative manner, then issuing more bonds may be 
the better choice.
Of course, a corporation takes and measures this decision within the appropriate 
context of the current value of the future cash flows anticipated in both choices. 
Of minimal consequence compared to other consideration, but still a considera-
tion, are the agency costs associated with each option. Issuing a new IPO tends to 
be more expensive than taking out a business loan, for example, and this must be 
considered when deciding which method is best to raise capital. The increased 
number of shares dilutes the value of each share of stock because the total corpo-
rate value is distributed across all shares outstanding.

CHAPTER 17  Weighing Capital      241
A wide number of variations on the basic calculations and variables are used for 
each equation that I discuss in this chapter. Some include the costs of potential 
bankruptcy when debt can’t be repaid. Others consider the increased short-term 
liquidity requirements during the debt repayment period and the influence that 
such reserve requirements have on lost potential revenues possible from reinvest-
ing that cash into longer-term assets.
The Modigliani-Miller Theorem, for example, suggests that capital structure has no 
bearing on corporate value, though this is widely considered to be a purely theo-
retical model established as a foundation upon which more useful models can 
grow (similar to CAPM, in that respect).
The reality, though, is that maximizing the value of stock shares means making 
decisions that increase earnings per share as much as possible, and, in some 
cases, taking on excessive amounts of risk. This risk is due to higher amounts of 
debt and acceptance of greater risk of loss in specific initiatives in order to pre-
serve stock value and place a maximum amount of risk on debt. This attitude 
toward capital structure has been cultivated by a combination of the “shareholder 
wealth maximization” model of corporate governance (which requires corpora-
tions to do what they can to increase the value of corporate shares), but also by 
executive incentive packages that include a large proportion of stock options as 
well as income based on the performance of the corporation’s stock value.

ou can analyze a corporation in many ways — by looking at its cash flows, 
equity, debt, assets, and so forth  — but one important consideration is 
whether the corporation is financially successful. That piece of information 
is worth knowing. Is the corporation you are looking at primed to be the next 
shooting star destined to be a global sensation, or is it doomed to suffer a fate that 
will land everyone associated with its operations in prison? Whether you are an 
investor, a manager, a regulator, an employee, a supplier, a partner, a competitor, 
or just some schmuck who writes introductory corporate finance books, it’s good 
to stay out of prison!
In this chapter, I explain how to evaluate whether a corporation is managing its 
finances effectively and whether it’s improving over time.
Analyzing Financial Success
Determining how financially successful a corporation is provides a lot more infor-
mation about the corporation than simply how well it manages money. Financial 
performance analyses are the way we pick apart, quantify, and measure every

aspect of the success of the corporation. Because the ultimate goal of a corporation 
is to generate some kind of tangible value for its customers, owners (sharehold-
ers), employees, and so forth, every aspect of the corporation’s activities can be 
assessed in financial terms.
The nature of money (see Chapter 1) combined with the legal obligation of corpo-
rations to maximize shareholder value make finance the ideal medium to assess 
how successful the corporation is, what activities are contributing to or detracting 
from that success, and how well the corporation generates value compared to oth-
ers in the industry.
A significant number of people are paid based on the financial performance of 
whatever they are responsible for managing. A few examples:
»
» Corporate executives are often paid based on the financial performance of 
the company (which isn’t necessarily a good thing when you consider that 
financial metrics can be manipulated in the short run to generate high 
bonuses at the cost of the long-run health of the company).
»
» Fund managers are typically paid based on how the portfolio they’re manag-
ing compares to the market.
»
» Many external firms, such as investment bankers, account managers, and 
mergers and acquisitions (M&A) consultants, are paid based on the success of 
the transactions made or sales closed.
Everyone else relies on corporations to be financially successful because when 
they’re not, companies go out of business, forcing many people to lose their jobs, 
suppliers to lose a customer, and the world as a whole to lose a value-generating 
organization.
Of course, if that entity isn’t operating efficiently, then it’s wasting resources that 
can be better allocated to a more competitive corporation. Analyzing the financial 
performance of the corporation is how you determine whether a corporation is 
competitive or will be lost to the natural selection of the market.
Using Common-Size Comparisons
Common-size comparisons, which are analyses used to do data comparisons, are 
some of the most valuable tools in assessing the financial success, or lack thereof, 
of a corporation. They come in two forms, vertical and horizontal, both providing 
a unique series of detailed information regarding each of the primary financial 

CHAPTER 18  Assessing Financial Performance      247
statements: the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash 
flows. While both the vertical and horizontal are valuable in their own right, yield-
ing insights into how effectively the corporation is being financially managed, 
they can also be used in conjunction with each other to provide even more 
information.
What makes common-size comparisons unique is that everything in them is bro-
ken down to a percentage value of a single reference point, allowing you to account 
for changes and proportions of a corporation’s finances. Vertical analyses, for 
example, reference the sum of the value of the corporation and track how a cor-
poration is utilizing its assets as a proportion of the total assets available, whereas 
horizontal analyses track changes over time as a proportion of a specific date used 
as a reference to determine how a corporation has improved (or not).
When these analyses are used together, it becomes possible to track changes in the 
proportions of value allocations throughout the company.
Common-size comparison analyses are used to determine how effectively the 
value of an organization is being managed and whether trends are improving.
Vertical common-size comparisons
Each vertical common-size comparison uses a single financial statement from a 
single year. In other words, you can do a vertical comparison of a corporation’s 
2021 income statement, and then another one for its 2022 income statement. 
These comparisons are intended to measure the allocation and usage of value 
within the organization by measuring the proportion of total value that is being 
distributed in each entry of the financial statement. They are called vertical com-
parisons because the items you are comparing on an income statement appear in 
a vertical list, rather than next to each other.
The following example takes you on a quick walk through a vertical common-size 
comparison of an income statement to show you how this process works.
You start at the very top with net sales (recall that this can also be called sales, 
revenue from sales, gross revenue, and so forth). That’s the point you are refer-
encing because that’s the total amount of money that the corporation brought in 
during the period being examined. From here, you can break down any other part 
of the income statement as a percentage of net sales. So, if your net sales are 
$100,000 and your cost of goods sold (COGS) are $65,000, then according to your 
vertical comparison, COGS represent 65 percent of net sales.
That means that 65 percent of all net sales are going into the cost of production, 
leaving 35 percent to pay for other expenses. Say that earnings before income and 

248      PART 5  Financial Management
tax (EBIT) is 5 percent. That means that administrative costs took up 30 percent 
of the net sales, leaving only 5 percent to be taxed on. By the end, the net income 
is 1 percent. The following table lists this data in order so you can see what this 
scenario looks like.

EBIT:

5%
Interest & tax:
$4,000
4%
Net income:

1%
By doing this analysis, you can easily compare items in the income statement as a 
proportion of total income. Of course, this can also be done in a balance sheet as a 
percentage of total assets, or in the statement of cash flows by breaking down 
each type of activity (for example, cash flow from operating activities) as a per-
centage of the total cash flows. This analysis makes it very simple to determine 
how a corporation’s value is being utilized and whether each item on the financial 
statements is efficiently being managed.
The ability to perform such an analysis becomes particularly useful when you 
begin talking about horizontal comparisons, industry comparisons, and time 
comparisons. You can compare your vertical analyses to other corporations in the 
same industry to see how the value utilization of your corporation is being man-
aged compared to others in the same industry. Vertical analyses can also be 
tracked over time to see whether individual items are improving over a period of 
several years, allowing you to track trends.
Horizontal common-size comparisons
Horizontal common-size comparisons are a bit different than their vertical coun-
terparts (see the preceding section). They still use only one type of financial state-
ment at a time, but instead of using that statement from just one year, they utilize 
several consecutive years’ worth of the same type of financial statement. For 
example, if a corporation were to do a horizontal analysis on its income state-
ment, it would use the income statements for 2020, 2021, and 2022. Three years 
of comparisons is pretty much the norm for horizontal analyses, but it’s very 

CHAPTER 18  Assessing Financial Performance      249
common to do extended analyses to measure long-term trends and to search for 
patterns or cycles in the corporation’s performance.
For consistency’s sake between the different types of comparisons, I use the 
income statement to illustrate how the horizontal common-size analysis works. 
Remember that each analysis can be used for every one of the major financial 
statements, but the income statement works particularly well for examples 
because it’s easy to illustrate and explain.

Interest & tax:

70%
46%
Net income:
$1,000
70%
46%
The reference year is always considered 100 percent, and the following years are 
measured as a proportion of that 100 percent value. For a horizontal analysis, 
you’re not at all worried about how value is being utilized or distributed through-
out the organization, only how those values change over time. So, the percentages 
shown are a percentage of a single reference year. Net sales, for example, were 
$100,000 in the first year, and then changed in the following two years, both ref-
erencing the first year rather than the year before (in other words, the column 
“Last Year” is measured as a percentage of the “Reference Year” rather than 
“Next Year”).
This horizontal analysis allows you to track changes in financial management 
over time to determine whether the corporation’s financial management is get-
ting better or worse, as well as where the changes are being experienced. In the 
preceding example, for instance, net sales increased over a 3-year period, mean-
ing that the corporation increased its sales during that period. But that wouldn’t 
matter if its costs increased more than its sales did.
In the example, though, the corporation did a very good job because although it 
increased its sales, it was able to cut its costs of production to a fraction of what 
they were in the reference year. More sales plus lower costs mean the company is 
utilizing its resources more efficiently.

250      PART 5  Financial Management
Still, the horizontal analysis tells you how things are changing only in a nominal 
sense, which isn’t entirely useful.
Cross comparisons
The horizontal common-size comparison (see the preceding section) does a lot to 
help you understand changes in a corporation’s finances over time by comparing 
financial reports from several consecutive years. Vertical comparisons, by con-
trast, tell you how efficiently corporate value is being allocated and utilized. There 
are two types of comparisons that utilize data from both the vertical and horizon-
tal analyses, producing cross comparisons.
They come in two flavors, neither of which has a name, so I call them the rate- 
of-change cross comparison and the time-distribution cross comparison.
Rate-of-change cross comparison
Before you can do a rate-of-change cross comparison, you must first do vertical 
common-size comparisons for several consecutive years. After the vertical com-
parisons are done, you can measure the amount that each comparison has changed 
over time. In other words, you are measuring the rate of change of each propor-
tion. If COGS increases from 10 percent of net sales in 2021 to 20 percent of net 
sales in 2022, you can say that COGS has increased as a proportion of net sales by 
100 percent in one year. This would be a very bad thing to happen, certainly, and 
would be worth knowing.
So, you’re doing a horizontal comparison of several vertical comparisons in this 
case. The reference year that other years are being compared to is adjusted to 100 
percent, and then the following years are a percentage change of the different 
vertical comparison proportions. This tells you whether asset utilization and allo-
cation are improving over time, which is a very important indicator of changes in 
corporate financial efficiency and trends in corporate financial management. 
Here’s a short example to illustrate the point.

Time-distribution cross comparison
This cross comparison is similar to the other cross comparison except in reverse. 
Start by doing horizontal cross-comparison analyses but pick only two of them — 
the one for the first year of the period you’re analyzing and the one for the last 
year of the period you’re analyzing. Realistically, you can do them for every year 
in between as well, but the point is you’re only doing this two years at a time. So, 
for this example, say you’re doing a horizontal comparison for the years 2021 and 
2022. Just two years.
After you finish the horizontal comparisons, you’re left with a series of percent-
ages showing how 2022 changed from 2021. Now it’s time for the vertical analysis. 
It’s important to note that, unlike a standard vertical analysis, these percentages 
don’t add up to 100 percent of net sales. But you’re still setting net sales (or total 
assets, or total cash flows) to 100 percent and then comparing all other entries in 
the analysis to that. By doing this, you’re collecting information on the degree to 
which each changed relative to net sales. So, if COGS is 101 percent of net sales in 
your cross comparison, that means that COGS increased by 1 percent more than 
net sales.
The goal here is to measure how much each entry changes relative to a reference 
point. This process allows analysts to understand better how allocations are 
changing over time and whether they’re becoming more or less efficient. Here’s a 
quick example to show how this analysis looks.

Performing Comparatives
Each of the financial metrics I talk about in this book is valuable in its own right, 
but, like financial statements, each is limited in the information it provides with-
out some sort of context. What you really want is to take each of those financial 
metrics and figure out how it compares to some reference point; otherwise, it 
doesn’t have much meaning. It’s just an abstract number that tells you about the 
company, but you have no idea whether the number attributed to the company is 
good or bad. A company may have an asset turnover of 3, which does provide some 
information about the company, sure, but you don’t know whether that’s a good 
thing or a bad thing. To understand that, you have to analyze performance com-
paratives, which is the process by which you add context to your financial metrics 
by comparing them to some other standard.
There are two standards that financial metrics are very commonly compared 
against: the same company in a different year, or other companies in the same 
year. I look at both in the following sections.
Comparison over time
A lot of what I talk about in this book (particularly in Chapters 4 through 8) is 
considered spot analysis: analysis for a single point (or spot) in time, rather than 
for assessing trends. Spot analysis is great if you live in a time loop that repeats 
the same moment over and over again; otherwise, the amount of useful informa-
tion you can derive from a single moment in time is pretty limited. So, instead of 
looking at your measures and metrics by themselves, you want to compare them 
to the previous years’ metrics and see how they’ve changed, if at all.
The goal here is to judge the current performance of a corporation based on the 
past performance of the same corporation. This analysis allows you to look for 
patterns in performance metrics, identify cyclical changes, note patterns in these 
changes over time, and determine whether the overall trend is good or bad. Iden-
tifying many of these patterns, such as whether there are cycles, allows you to 
begin identifying the causes of those patterns. Being able to recognize what influ-
ences your financial performance allows you to be more proactive in responding 
to those influences, as well as potentially even managing the influences them-
selves to react in your own favor.
Watching for patterns, cycles, and current trends allows you to project future 
financial performance as well. It’s important to note that these are estimates, 
though, because human error tends to be a frequent cause of problems. Even  
when that’s not a factor, it’s important to recognize that as you attempt to project 
further into the future, your estimates will be less accurate. It’s much easier to 

CHAPTER 18  Assessing Financial Performance      253
project what your finances will look like tomorrow than it is to project what they’ll 
look like in ten years. Chapter 19 gets into financial forecasting.
Take a look at a couple examples of how a time analysis of financial metrics can 
make a big difference compared to just a single calculation of any financial metric.
The Quick Ratio is a measure of liquidity that calculates a corporation’s ability to 
pay off debt that will become due in the next year. It’s calculated as follows: [(cur-
rent assets-inventories)/current liabilities]. With that in mind, here’s the first 
example.
Corporation A in 2022: Quick Ratio = 0.7
That doesn’t sound so bad, does it? In a worst-case scenario where the company 
can’t sell any of its current inventories, it’s still able to account for 70 percent of 
its current liabilities using its highly liquid assets. But is that really a good thing? 
Compare that against time.
Corporation A in 2021: Quick Ratio = 0.9
Corporation A in 2020: Quick Ratio = 1.2
Uh oh! The company appears to be losing liquidity at a rate of about 26 percent 
annually! That’s very fast! It may have a lot of debt coming to maturity this year, 
it may not be collecting revenues quickly enough, or it may simply not be making 
as many sales. In any case, this doesn’t look good for the corporation.
Don’t take this example the wrong way, though. Take a look at a second, almost-
identical, example to see how they differ in important ways.
Corporation A in 2022: Quick Ratio = 1.0
Corporation A in 2021: Quick Ratio = 1.3
Corporation A in 2020: Quick Ratio = 1.7
The corporation is still losing liquidity at a rate of about 26 percent annually dur-
ing the same three years, but the significant difference is that the ratio is still 
much higher. It’s still able to cover all of its current liabilities using only highly 
liquid assets. Not only is this not as severe as the other example, but it may actu-
ally be considered a good thing! Holding all your assets in a highly liquid form 
means you’re not using them to generate more revenues. The corporation in this 
example may be intentionally lowering its liquidity in order to increase its returns 
on investment or increase the efficiency of its asset management.

254      PART 5  Financial Management
As you can see, finding trends is much easier than interpreting them. Whether a 
reduction in liquidity is helping or harming the corporation’s financial well-being 
depends greatly on a number of other factors. You may want to consider combin-
ing this example with a horizontal common-size comparison of the corporation’s 
balance sheet and income statement to see whether it’s having trouble generating 
revenues or turning sales into cash. You can also do this via a time comparison of 
receivables turnover or turnover in days to determine whether the company is 
collecting revenues or taking longer than normal to do so.
The key to understanding context in these time-comparison metrics is to look at 
what variables will influence or be influenced by the change. In the liquidity 
example, the things that really matter are how much debt is changing, how much 
revenue is changing, projections of revenue collection on old sales, projections of 
new sales, and the amount of debt the company will be able to pay off after other 
bills are also accounted for. This type of analysis is a great way to understand the 
state of a corporation and what to expect out of it in the future.
Comparison against the industry
Maybe the corporation you’re analyzing has improved dramatically over the years. 
Its common-size analyses make it seem like the corporation’s asset allocations 
are steadily improving, and a comparison of its financial metrics over the last ten 
years supports that by showing improved financial health. Is the corporation 
really doing well, though? How can you even tell if you’re just looking at one com-
pany? If a corporation has a current ratio of 1.5, which is up from 5 years ago when 
its current ratio was 0.5, what does that even mean for its operations?
If other corporations in the same industry (in other words, competitors) are 
maintaining current ratios of 5.5, then the improvement from 0.5 to 1.5 still 
sounds pretty risky. It could simply be that the corporation you’re analyzing is 
better at managing its assets, or it could be that the industry it competes in takes 
a very long time to collect sales revenues, requiring businesses to maintain a lot 
of cash or other liquid assets or else risk insolvency. In any case, whether it’s good 
or bad, you’d never know that the corporation you were analyzing was strange 
unless you compared it to other corporations in the same industry.
Using industry averages
Quite frequently you don’t compare the corporation against just one other com-
petitor, or even several other competitors individually. When you’re comparing 
the financial performance of your corporation against the industry, it’s typical to 
use industry averages. These are calculated using just a simple mean. If you want 
to know what the industry average is for current ratios, you find out the current 

CHAPTER 18  Assessing Financial Performance      255
ratio for all the competitors in the industry, add them up, and then divide by the 
number of competitors. For example:
Current Ratios in Industry: 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.9 + 1.0 = 3.6
Divided by the Number of Competitors in the Industry (5) = 0.72
So, you know that the industry average current ratio is 0.72. Do you know why it’s 
0.72? Not yet, but you know it’s common for companies in this industry to main-
tain very low liquidity at any given point. You also know that your company has a 
current ratio of 0.75. That’s very close to the industry average and probably  
doesn’t indicate anything important. So, using a company that maintains liquidity 
that’s pretty average, you decide to take a look at its inventory turnover in days 
and receivables turnovers in days. You find that this corporation sells its invento-
ries very quickly and even collects its money very quickly. As a result of this very 
fast inflow of cash, it doesn’t need to maintain very high liquidity because it can 
safely assume that it will be getting more very quickly, allowing it to invest a 
greater proportion of its assets in longer-term investments that generate high 
yields. Spectacular!
So, what would it mean if your corporation had a current ratio of 1.5? That would 
mean that it wasn’t efficiently using its assets to generate income. If it had a cur-
rent ratio of 0.2, it might be at huge risk of becoming insolvent. Even though all 
these numbers, by themselves, are very vague, when you add the context of the 
industry average, you can see how your corporation is doing compared to the 
competition. It gives you a chance to understand why the industry attempts to 
maintain certain metrics, why the corporation in question deviates from the aver-
age, and whether that’s indicative of something good or bad.
Comparing changes in the industry
One additional thing to take into consideration is a comparison of changes in the 
industry over time. After you know what the industry average is for a particular 
metric and you know how your corporation compares, you can also track how this 
relationship changes over time.
Is your corporation increasing its liquidity faster than the industry average? Is it 
decreasing its profitability slower than average? Is it improving its asset manage-
ment at exactly the same rate as the industry average? All of these questions are 
relevant to understanding how a corporation is doing in a competitive market. 
Like other time-based analytics, this analysis helps you to project future perfor-
mance as well as evaluate the health of the corporation compared to the industry 
as a whole.

256      PART 5  Financial Management
Keep in mind that an entire industry can quite possibly be demented, so don’t rely 
exclusively on industry-based comparisons. Look at how an individual company is 
changing over time (like I discuss in the earlier section “Comparison over time”) 
as well as the spot rates.
Don’t forget to check the quality of the earnings a company is making, too. Just 
because it’s generating earnings now doesn’t mean those earnings have any qual-
ity; they may be one-time payments that will disappear in the next cycle.
Determining the Quality of Earnings
Not all earnings are created equal. Sometimes a source of earnings will be volatile, 
temporary, or uncertain. Two primary factors can undermine the quality of the 
earnings listed on the financial statement: choices of different accounting meth-
ods, and the sources of revenues and costs. Each of these can be broken down into 
more detailed concerns, and each also influences whether the earnings a corpora-
tion is generating are sustainable, maintainable, or retainable. Bottom line, just 
because a corporation seems to be generating earnings doesn’t mean that the 
corporation is successful or even that it isn’t at risk of going completely out of 
business.
Accounting concerns
Despite the reputation of accounting as being a field of relentlessly stiff regula-
tions and methodologies, corporations are given freedom to decide their preferred 
method of valuation on several issues. Sometimes corporations are allowed to 
decide the accounting period in which to account for a particular cost or revenue; 
other times they’re allowed to choose from any of several options regarding the 
manner in which costs, revenues, or assets are to be valued. Because such vari-
ances occur as corporations record these things using differing methods, the exact 
manner in which their financial statements should be viewed or interpreted can 
also change.
A corporation may appear to have unusually high profits one year until you come 
to realize that it has deferred certain costs until the next year in order to better 
utilize its tax deductions; otherwise, it would have lost money in the current year.
The point is that things are not always as they seem. Your ability to understand 
the implications of the accounting decisions that corporations make can be just as 
critical as your ability to calculate the financial metrics themselves. Here are some 
of the more common accounting issues to be concerned with.

CHAPTER 18  Assessing Financial Performance      257
Inventory accounting
There are two primary methods of inventory accounting:
»
» FIFO: Stands for First-In-First-Out, which means that whatever inventory was 
produced first is considered to be the first inventory sold. When measuring 
the cost of goods sold, the corporation measures the cost to produce the first 
items made rather than the most recent items made.
»
» LIFO: Stands for Last-In-First-Out, which means the last items to become 
inventory are considered the first to be sold. So, when measuring the cost of 
goods sold, the corporation measures the cost to make the most recent 
inventory produced rather than the first inventory produced.
There are several others, many of which attempt to utilize the best of both LIFO 
and FIFO; others account for costs in a manner related to project management 
(the amount of the project completed). For the purposes of this section, though, 
LIFO and FIFO illustrate quite well what you need to know about this particular 
subject. Anyway, remember that costs change over time. (For more information 
about LIFO and FIFO, see Chapter 5.)
During inflationary periods (periods of time where costs, overall, are increasing), 
using the LIFO method results in the appearance of higher costs because the more 
recent inventory will have cost more to produce. Using the FIFO method, on the 
other hand, gives the illusion of costs being lower than they really have been 
because the corporation is accounting for the cheaper historical cost of 
production.
Of course, there’s a flip side to this. During deflationary periods (periods of time 
where costs are decreasing, which rarely ever happens except in deep recessions), 
using the LIFO method makes the company appear to have lower costs whereas 
the FIFO method makes costs appear more expensive. Neither one of these meth-
ods is inherently bad, but you do have to take them into account when studying 
the costs, liabilities, and earnings that a corporation generates. Realize that just 
because a corporation may appear to be “safe” right now doesn’t mean that this 
can’t be artificially generated.
During a deflationary period, companies using LIFO may see that they appear to 
be incurring lower costs and make the improper decision of lowering price or 
attempt to use the appearance of higher profitability to take on new loans. Though 
the companies would appear to be more profitable, the true costs of production 
would simply be in past inventory, putting the company at serious risk due to the 
actions taken on false pretenses.

258      PART 5  Financial Management
Depreciation
As I explain in Chapter 4, you can use several different methods of accounting for 
depreciation: straight-line, double-declining, and so on. The method of deprecia-
tion a corporation chooses has an influence on both the income statement (because 
depreciation is counted as a cost) and the balance sheet (because depreciation 
influences the total value of the corporation’s assets). So, of course, knowing what 
type of depreciation the corporation is using is quite helpful in understanding how 
to interpret financial statements and their respective metrics. Particularly for those 
corporations that have a very large amount of fixed assets with depreciation to be 
accounted for, the method of accounting chosen can have a very significant impact 
on how those companies’ earnings look to analysts who don’t consider this fact.
The exact influence that each depreciation method has depends on the method 
you’re looking at. Those methods of accounting that depreciate the value of an 
asset more quickly account for a higher amount of depreciation cost in the early 
years of the life of the asset. They also reduce the total asset value of the company 
on the balance sheet more quickly when accounting for that particular asset. 
Those methods that last longer attribute a greater amount of the depreciation cost 
later on, not only recording the total asset value of the company as artificially high 
(the market value of assets decreases at an inverse logarithmic rate, meaning that 
it decreases fast early on and then levels-out over time), but also giving potential 
to account for greater depreciation costs on the income statement than were actu-
ally experienced, causing artificially high net income.
Cost recognition
Companies don’t have to recognize their costs in the year in which those costs are 
incurred. This poses certain tax benefits. A corporation that has already used all 
the tax deductions it wants for one year can sometimes utilize some in the follow-
ing year. For particularly large costs, it’s possible to do something called amorti-
zation, whereby the expense of an asset (especially intangible assets) is recognized 
over a period of time, usually the lifetime of the asset. Like depreciation, those 
methods of amortizing or recognizing costs that account for the entirety of the 
expense sooner tend to be more conservative and, therefore, contribute to higher 
quality in earnings reports.
Sources of cash flows
Looking at the source of cash flows can help to determine the quality of a corpora-
tion’s earnings. The amount of earnings during any single year doesn’t tell you 
whether those earnings can be expected again in the future or even whether they 
were consistently maintained throughout a single period. (The latter implies that 
earnings may have either been cyclical, or otherwise generated high revenues 
during one portion of the period and made no sales at all during another part).

CHAPTER 18  Assessing Financial Performance      259
Although there are many potential sources of low-quality cash flows, I only go 
over two of the most common: temporary transactions and volatile income 
sources. This discussion should at least help you understand what I’m talking 
about so you can watch for other similar problems that may arise when analyzing 
financial statements and making corporate financial decisions.
Temporary transactions
On a lot of income statements, you may see categories called something similar to 
“one-time revenues,” “one-time costs,” or anything else that indicates that the 
source of the cost/income is not to be expected in the future. Such income may 
include revenues from a lawsuit won, payments to rebuild a parking lot after a 
meteor strike, or the boss’s dumb kid “losing” the day’s revenues on the way to 
deposit them in the company’s bank account. The problem is that these things 
aren’t necessarily listed as separate items on the financial statements, so it may 
be a good idea for you to try and seek them out.
One common source of temporary transactions that can be quite significant (if 
you’re careful not to be fooled) are those transactions that are longer than a single 
period. Amortizing the costs on intangible assets over long periods of time can be 
deceptive, and if you don’t watch out, long-term repayments and fixed-income 
sources of revenues (annuities, for example) can also end suddenly, reducing 
revenues.
Often, rather than being listed as temporary transactions, these sorts of cash 
flows are listed as “revenues from other sources” or “other costs,” which isn’t 
exactly useful when you’re attempting to evaluate the quality and duration of 
those revenues and costs.
If you’re a stockholder, you have the right to request information such as items 
listed in the “other” categories. Requesting this info may also be a good idea if 
you’re considering investing in such a corporation — it’s an even better idea if 
you’re the manager of one.
Volatile income sources
If you’re looking at the annual report of a corporation, odds are it lists just the 
end-of-year financial information for the current year, with several past years for 
comparison and perhaps projections for the next one or two years.
What you really want to watch for here is the statement of cash flows, because 
that will help you identify where all the money is coming from and where it’s 
going, though often only one year at a time.

260      PART 5  Financial Management
Having several years’ worth of these statements can help you determine how con-
sistent revenues and costs are over time. If anything appears to be increasing, 
decreasing, or both to extreme degrees, then these may not be the kind of reve-
nues or costs you can count on being consistent or continuing at all. Deeper inves-
tigation into what the company is doing may be helpful in determining whether 
they will be a problem. Perhaps a revenue just stops being collected entirely, or 
maybe a cost increases dramatically one year without revenues increasing pro-
portionally to make up for that cost, thus causing liquidity problems.
Another volatility issue to be concerned with is intra-year cyclical volatility. There 
are a number of industries whose sales are extremely cyclical depending on the 
season within a single year. The tourism industry (for example, hotels, resorts, 
and so forth) are very cyclical and tend to have a very slow “off-season.” To iden-
tify these, often you have to resort to evaluating the corporation’s quarterly reports, 
financial reports that are issued at the end of each quarter. These reports can help 
you identify what’s going on within a single year that may not be easily identified 
in the annual reports.
Assessing Investment Performance
As you’ve probably already noticed, corporate finance is largely focused on how 
you get money and how that money is then used. It should come as no surprise, 
then, that corporations are very concerned about whether they are using their 
money effectively. Of course, there are several views on what constitutes the 
effective use of money, and at least twice as many measures of success, but the 
general idea is that any money spent should generate value for the company. This 
is usually determined, at the bare minimum, by whether the money spent has cre-
ated a positive return on investment. In other words, if you spent money on some-
thing, did that thing contribute to the creation of revenues greater than the 
amount you spent? Hopefully the answer is yes; otherwise, you spent more money 
on a particular expenditure than that expenditure can generate in revenues.
Determining whether a corporation is successfully using its money to invest in 
assets and operations isn’t always that easy, and the metrics used are very easily 
manipulated in ways that puff up short-term metrics to guarantee that those in 
charge of financial management get paid the big bucks. Look for the underlying 
value of these transactions and the impact in the long term, rather than how mar-
kets move in the short term.
Conventional evaluations
The degrees of success being generated by corporations can be measured in far 
more ways than I can ever hope to cover in a single chapter. Nevertheless, I go 

CHAPTER 18  Assessing Financial Performance      261
over several different methods for evaluating the success of standard capital 
investments as well as financial or portfolio investments.
Each chapter talking about how to assess the value and price of an investment 
(Chapters 10 through 12) helps to establish some of the fundamentals of evalua-
tion. For example, if you purchase an investment with the expectation that it will 
yield a certain percentage as returns and it doesn’t, well, you did something 
wrong. Your ability to compare the actual returns against the projected returns 
does a lot for your ability to establish what success is and whether you’ve been 
successful in your investments.
Simply put, if you analyze the value of something and fail to extract that value 
from it, then you’ve failed either in your assessment of its value or in your attempt 
to extract that value. If you extract equal or greater value from that expenditure 
than anticipated, then you’ve succeeded. The degree of failure or success in these 
cases can be measured simply as the percentage over or under the projected rate 
of return. If you’re expecting 10 percent returns and you get 20 percent returns, 
then you’ve succeeded by a margin of 200 percent, which may result in a big, fat, 
end-of-year bonus!
Arithmetic rate of returns
The arithmetic rate of return on a specific asset is pretty simple. It’s a spot mea-
surement that measures only the total rate of return over the life of the invest-
ment, like this:
R
V
P
P
t
/
where:
Vt = The value of the asset at time t
P = Purchase price
So, take the value of your asset at any point in history, subtract your purchase 
price to determine your gain or loss, and then divide that by your purchase price 
to determine the rate of return. It’s a very simple calculation that provides very 
important information about how well you’re utilizing your purchases, assets, 
investments  .  .  .  pretty much everything you own. For those assets that don’t 
increase in value but produce things of value (such as machinery), you can include 
the value of those things produced as a part of your value at time, t.
A variation on this includes calculations that account for reinvestment of the cash 
flows generated on the investment, for those investments that generate cash 
flows or can be reinvested after maturity (for example, capital, bonds, dividend-
generating stocks, and money market investments).

262      PART 5  Financial Management
Average rate of returns
The average rate of returns starts with the rate of return and measures that for 
every year you care about (the years you’re including in your calculation). You add 
up the rate of return from each year, then divide it by the number of years you’re 
measuring. That’s the average rate of return. If you just happen to care, the cal-
culation looks like this and makes the process much more intimidating than it 
actually is:

Time-weighted rate of returns
The average rate of return distributes all returns equally so that the rate is the 
same each year. Using the time-weighted approach gives you a better under-
standing about how performance changes by weighting the returns from each 
year being included. This calculation is done like so:
r

This method of determining your rate of return is more accurate because it 
accounts for changes in the rate of return over time. It may look intimidating, but 
it really isn’t. Here’s how it’s done:
1.	 Find the rate of return from each year and add 1 to each.
2.	 Multiply the answers together.
3.	 Divide your answer in Step 2 by 1/n, where n is the number of years.
4.	 Subtract 1 from your answer in Step 3.
5.	 Multiply the answer in Step 4 by 100 to get your answer as a percentage.
Risk adjusted return on capital
The return on capital assets generated per dollar of economic capital is called the 
risk adjusted return on capital.
RAROC = Rate of Return/Economic Capital
Economic capital is the amount of liquid assets that a corporation must keep on 
hand to be able to handle risk concerns: credit risk, liquidity risk, and so on. So, 
this method of calculating the rate of return accounts for risk generated by mea-
suring the amount or return per dollar of capital the corporation must keep on 
hand to compensate for the additional risk generated.

CHAPTER 19  Forecasting Finances      263
Chapter 19
Forecasting Finances
M
uch like forecasting the weather, forecasting finances is a data-driven 
endeavor that requires some research, some statistics, and a continu-
ously changing margin of error. Unlike the forecasts of meteorologists 
and stock investors, however, internal corporate finances are a bit more reliable 
and the calculations used are a whole lot simpler.
Determining your company’s future financially involves calculating the market 
conditions in the present using methods you develop when studying trends of the 
past. Many factors shape a company’s financial status at any given time, including:
»
» The operations of a corporation
»
» The corporation’s relative performance and competitive position within the 
industry
»
» The industry’s role in the greater economy
The goal is to identify how these factors continue to shape the present and to 
determine the needs of a corporation at any point in the future. Simple estimates 
are things like the daily cash needs and monthly bills, since each cycle is very 
short, and any changes are quickly identified.
If you attempt to project financial statements at three, five, or seven years, you 
run into much more uncertainty, because the degree to which operating condi-
tions can change is much larger. For planning purposes, your goal is to determine 
how much reality could differ from your predictions.

Seeing with Analytical Eyes
To successfully forecast finances, you have to let go of your preconceived notions 
about the future and let analytics guide your ideas. Way too many people working 
in forecasting and projections allow their established ideas and beliefs to get in 
the way of what may otherwise be very promising analytics. So, to start, you must 
disregard what you think you know about the corporation you’re studying and 
relearn everything, starting with the company’s historical data. After you under-
stand the data, you can use everything you already know about the company to 
determine the reason the corporation is performing in that manner. Only then can 
you predict what is going to happen.
One common mistake, known as confirmation bias, is that people tend to look at the 
data to simply confirm what they think they already know. Confirmation bias is 
the normal result of the human tendency to rely on patterns and trends to make 
sense of the world, but it can also cause you to be relatively easily fooled. Analyze 
the data first and then worry about using what you know to explain the data.
Collecting data
Before you can analyze any data that will help you project your corporation’s 
future financial performance, you need to collect that data. Thankfully, in the age 
of the Internet, this task is actually pretty easy. (For more information on collect-
ing data, see Chapter 2.)
Bigger data sets tend to generate more accurate estimates. Learning to use com-
puter programs like SAS or to program using languages like Python can make your 
calculations go much faster.
Honestly, data collection can be a pretty tedious process. Narrowing down the 
exact type of information you are looking for can help a lot, and people are gener-
ally more forthcoming with the information. Otherwise, you just end up collecting 
everything that may be relevant and sorting it out later.
The nice part about financial data is that everything about the data itself is the 
same. It’s all measured in money, so you don’t have to worry about the technical 
details of the different types of data or anything. Welcome to the first shortcut.
Knowing where to look
The vast majority of financial data you’ll want about any corporation will come 
from just a handful of locations:

CHAPTER 19  Forecasting Finances      265
»
» Financial reports: Financial reports are usually the first place to look because 
they’re easy to find and already formatted in a way that’s simple to analyze. I 
don’t just mean the annual reports, either — the quarterly reports, monthly 
reports, and everything else are important as well.
»
» Reports regarding inventory, production, and employment: Corporations, 
particularly larger ones, will distribute reports on inventory, production, and 
employment occasionally, especially when prompted by one organization or 
another that’s attempting to compile economic reports. Even more detailed 
records are available internally.
»
» Accounting records: If you can get your hands on the corporation’s account-
ing records, those are easily the most comprehensive and detailed sources of 
data you can find.
»
» Internet sources: Financial information, including pre-calculated metrics, are 
available on many websites. Check out https://finance.yahoo.com, www.
nasdaq.com, and https://sec.gov/edgar to start.
Comparing your data
As with any financial data, you can benefit by collecting the same information 
from several companies in the same industry for comparison.
Research data on the national economy. Fortunately, you don’t actually have to 
compile this data because a variety of sources provide decent-quality reports on 
this issue:
»
» The U.S. government offers several sources for economic data. Some include 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis (www.bea.gov) and the National Bureau of 
Economic Research (www.nber.org/data).
»
» The International Monetary Fund’s research can be found at www.imf.org/
external/data.htm.
»
» The World Bank has economic data available online at http://data.
worldbank.org/data-catalog.
»
» Several other agencies, such as the United Nations (https://unstats.
un.org/unsd/business-stat/) and the U.S. Federal Reserve (www. 
federalreserve.gov/econres.htm), provide great information.

266      PART 5  Financial Management
Finding an average
After you collect all your data, you need to figure out what to do with it. You need 
to do some simple descriptive calculations of statistics and probability, which is the 
mathematics of uncertainty. In other words, you measure the likelihood of an 
event occurring using information about performance and relationships between 
variables.
When you have a lot of different values for a variable, finding an average will tell 
you the middle value — in other words, what is typical. Averages fall into different 
types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, but the vast majority of finan-
cial equations use the mean average.
To calculate the mean average, you need to add all the values and divide that total 
by the number of values. In the example 1
2
3
4
5
15 5
3
/
, the mean is 3.
To look at a weighted average (an average that takes into account differences in the 
importance of each value), you attach a weight to each value. For instance, if one 
of the values in the preceding example was worth 60 percent of the entire sample 
and the rest weighted equally at 10 percent each, then the average changes a bit:
1 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
5 6
0 1
0 2
0 3
0 4
3 0
4
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
The weighted average is 4 because the value 5 has more weight than the other 
values, bringing the average up a bit compared to the standard mean. The total 
weight is 100 percent, which is 1 as a decimal, which is why each value is being 
multiplied by a decimal — .1 is 10 percent, .6 is 60 percent. So whatever proportion 
a specific value consists of, multiply that by its decimal (for example, 75 percent 
is .75).
Most people use the weighted average when a product or investment portfolio has 
different proportions of resource allocations. You use weighted average when you 
are accounting for time-weighted averages and the more recent values are more 
important than historical ones.
Commonly used in financial analysis and projections are moving averages, which 
take the average from a predetermined number of days prior to a given day. So, for 
a three-day moving average on Wednesday, you include data going back to Mon-
day; for Thursday, you collect all the data going as far back as Tuesday; and for 
Friday, you go back to Wednesday. This data helps illustrate whether the mean is 
increasing or decreasing over time.

CHAPTER 19  Forecasting Finances      267
Measuring distribution
Obviously, not all the numbers in a data set are going to be exactly the same as the 
average. You can measure the manner in which data is distributed around the 
average in a few different ways. Say that the average net income of a corporation 
is $10,000. That’s great, but it doesn’t tell you whether that number changes 
much. The corporation may very consistently earn $10,000 every year, or it may 
earn $0 in the year before and $20,000 the year after. This information is the sort 
of thing worth knowing, and you can measure it in a few ways.
Range
Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values. If a corporation 
had earnings of $10,000 and $20,000, you could say it had a two-year range of 
$10,000, or 100 percent. If you were to look at the range for the corporation’s 
earnings over the last 20 years, you may want to pay attention to its interquartile 
range (the range of the middle 50 percent of values) to make sure that the corpo-
ration didn’t experience unusually high or low earnings in certain years, which 
can throw off your data. You should not completely ignore the rare year of very 
high or low performance in an otherwise stable company, but for the purposes 
here, we reject years like this as unlikely.
To find the interquartile range, you take the earnings from all the years and put 
them in numerical order, divide them into four equal pieces, and then take the 
range of the middle two pieces. So, if a corporation’s earnings had a range of 
$100,000 but an interquartile range of only $20,000, you may think that the cor-
poration had some extreme dispersion in its earnings in some of those years. On 
graphs, these ranges are often illustrated in a couple ways.
To compare changes in specified time intervals, box plots (see Figure 19-1, which 
shows range and interquartile range in the form of vertical rectangles with lines 
coming out the top and bottom) are often used to show changes in the mean and 
distribution of financial data, while changing trends in dispersion are often 
included in Bollinger bands (see Figure 19-1, which illustrates the mean, maxi-
mum, and minimum values in a range over time).

Standard deviation
Standard deviation, another measure of distribution, this time represented by the 
letter σ (sigma), is a concept used quite frequently in equations, and here’s how 
you calculate it:
1.	 Calculate the mean.
For example:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5; Mean = 3
2.	 Subtract each value from the mean.
For example:
3
1
2 3
2
1 3
3
0
,
,
 
 
, and so on
3.	 Square each difference.
For example:
2
4 1
1 0
0
1
1
2

4.	 Add the squares together.
For example:
4

1
4
10
5.	 Divide the answer by the number of values.
For example:
10 5
2
/
6.	 Take the square root of the answer in Step 5.
For example:
2
1 41
.
So, the standard deviation is 1.41. That means that the dispersion of the values 
away from the mean is measured in units worth 1.41 each. Standard deviation is 
extremely useful because it shows how spread out the data is and allows you to 
calculate the probability of financial performance being very different from the 
average.

CHAPTER 19  Forecasting Finances      269
Calculating probability
The total probabilities of an event occurring or not will always equal 100 percent. 
If you have a 10 percent probability that something may happen, then you have a 
90 percent probability that it won’t. The simplest example is the coin toss. You 
have a 50 percent probability that the coin will land on either side because only 
two options exist. Take 100 percent probability, divide it by two options, and each 
option has a 50 percent probability. Each time you flip that coin, you have a  
50 percent probability of it being heads or tails. Just because it lands on heads  
100 times in a row doesn’t mean the coin has a better chance of landing on tails: 
On flip 101, you still have a 50 percent probability that it will land on tails. (A lot 
of gamblers get stuck in that trap.)
Ceteris paribus means “all things remaining equal.” When calculating the probabil-
ity of something happening in response to something else, we often assume that 
nothing else is influencing that relationship. The truth is that the context in which 
that dynamic exists can play a big role. Determining why things are related is more 
important than how they are related and can help you avoid confusing correlation 
with causation. These terms are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
When you apply probability theory to the standard deviation, you end up with 
something called a normal distribution.
The normal distribution, shown in Figure 19-2, has a lot of very important traits, 
but all you really need to know for this book is the relationship between standard 
deviation, probability, and the distribution of data. The percentages in the curve 
itself tell you what percentages of the data are included within the number of 
standard deviation units listed at the bottom. After you calculate the standard 
deviation and mean, you can figure out probability pretty easily. For example, say 
that you have a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 1. According to the graph, 
34 percent of all values will be between 5 and 6, 68 percent of all cases will be 
between 4 and 6, and so on.

270      PART 5  Financial Management
Why on Earth do you care about normal distribution? You care because probability 
calculations are used frequently in financial forecasts. Say that you want to predict 
the most probable percentage drop in the stock market as a result of an increase 
in interest rates. By collecting historical data and determining the mean and stan-
dard deviations, you can estimate the likely range to any percentage of probability. 
You can say that the stock market has a 68 percent probability of dropping by 1 to 
2 percent or a 95 percent probability that it will drop between 0.8 to 2.2 percent.
The more certain you want to be, the wider your range must be, because you have 
to account for a greater range of data that encompasses a particular level of 
probability.
To take this calculation a step further, say that, given the event that the stock 
market drops by 1 to 2 percent, you want to determine the probability that a  
specific corporation’s stock will also drop by 1 to 2 percent. You can come up with 
the answer to this interesting question by using something called Bayesian 
Probability:
P A B
P B A P A
P B
(

(

This equation says that in order to calculate the probability of thing A happening 
conditionally of thing B, you take the following steps:
1.	 Take the probability of thing B happening as a result of thing A and 
multiply that amount by the probability of thing A.
2.	 Divide the answer by the probability of thing B happening.
In other words, if there is a 95 percent chance of lumber prices decreasing if new 
imports are allowed (thing B) and a 50 percent chance of a policy allowing new 
lumber imports to be passed (thing A), but only a 68 percent probability that lum-
ber prices will decrease without new imports, you can calculate the chances of 
decreasing costs on new construction like this:

Viewing the Past as New
Most companies are obsessive with their money and use a lot of time and resources 
to track and record it. That’s a good thing because just about all the historical data 
you could ever want regarding corporate finance has been calculated and com-
piled, so you don’t have to do any of that research. You just need to collect the data 
that others have found.

CHAPTER 19  Forecasting Finances      271
Reviewing historical data, though, is really the part where you need to shut off 
everything you think you know. In Chapter 22, I discuss a bit about behavioral 
finance, and behavioral mistakes tend to be amplified when you’re dealing with 
issues of uncertainty, such as forecasting. So, go into your research with an open 
mind, allow the data to surprise you, and always look for something new and 
interesting that others may not have noticed in order to get a financial edge.
Different nations have different laws, expectations, and histories regarding the 
storage of financial data. In addition, new corporations are constantly forming all 
over the world. Be sure the data you are using is new enough to be relevant to your 
needs.
Finding trends and patterns
When you review historical data, the first thing to do is look for trends and pat-
terns. If you can identify trends that are occurring and any cyclical patterns that 
have happened in the past, you can gain important insight into what will happen 
in the future.
Start with patterns, for example. You can usually best explore patterns by graph-
ing your data. Try several different graphs and really look at each of them to see 
whether you can recognize any patterns that begin to emerge. For example, if you 
randomly pick a set of revenue information without knowing which company they 
belong to and see a pattern where sales go up in the summer and down in the 
winter, you can easily determine that the company’s sales follow a cyclical pattern 
based on the seasons. You can probably even begin to guess what type of company 
it was, perhaps naming the company without ever being told.
Not all patterns are as obvious or simple as this example, but the basic premise is 
the same: You’re looking for any patterns that will allow you to predict what will 
happen in the future of your corporation’s finances.
Trend is also important. You’re looking for both short-term and long-term trends. 
Here’s a perfect example. Go look at a graph of the stock market online (www.
google.com/finance). Looks pretty jagged, right, with lots of ups and downs? 
Now zoom out, which increases the time-duration you’re looking at on the graph. 
Keep zooming out. Starting to see a bigger trend? Overall, the stock market has 
been increasing in value relatively smoothly over time. That long-term positive 
trend is made up of short-term upward and downward trends, but overall, it is 
leading to an increase in value over the course of many decades.
Find trends like this one in all the things you do. Understand how long each short-
term trend lasts, try to predict when it will change direction, and figure out what 
the trends are doing in the long run.

272      PART 5  Financial Management
Looking at regression
The goal of regression is to look at past data to determine whether any variables are 
influencing financial movements.
The regression process now typically utilizes very advanced computer programs, 
such as analytics software and databases, to perform something called data min-
ing. Basically, data mining works by including all the data you can possibly get 
your hands on and letting a computer program figure out whether any correlation 
exists between the thing you are trying to forecast and other variables. You can do 
data mining on your own, but unless you have some idea what you are looking for, 
it’s just guess-and-check, which stinks.
For example, you may find that your corporation’s costs increase with the tem-
perature outside. As the temperature increases, so does total costs; as temperature 
decreases, the corporate costs also decrease. You may even find that, on average, 
costs change by 1 percent for every 3 percent change in temperature. This rela-
tionship is called a correlation.
Note that correlation is not the same as causation. If all relationships were causa-
tional, you can make the argument that increases in Google search volume for the 
word “puff” caused decreases in interest in the housing market. These two things 
have a very close inverse correlation according to Google Trends. However, noth-
ing demonstrates that one causes the other. This is nothing more than a spurious 
correlation — a correlation that’s merely coincidental.
So, in this example, if temperature and cost are correlated, the relationship may 
look something like Figure 19-3.
FIGURE 19-3: 
Regression 
analysis. 
© John Wiley & Sons

CHAPTER 19  Forecasting Finances      273
The little dots in Figure 19-3 are the actual values included. You plot them as you 
do on any graph: Find the correct spot on the horizontal axis (temperature), move 
up to the correct spot on the vertical axis (cost), and place the dot where the two 
intersect. The line going through them illustrates the proportion of the relation-
ship. (In this case, a one-third slope indicates that for every 1 unit increase in cost, 
temperature increases by 3 units.) Remember that correlation doesn’t mean that 
the temperature is causing a price increase — just that the two are related.
Consider the following about Figure 19-3:
»
» As one factor increases, the other increases as well. That’s called a positive correlation.
»
» If one factor decreases as the other increases, it’s called a negative correlation.
»
» The closer the dots are to the line, the stronger the relationship is. If the dots 
are far away from the line and don’t look like they’re in a pattern, the relation-
ship is very weak. In Figure 19-3, the relationship is fairly strong because you 
can see the pattern even without the line present.
Knowing what to do with correlations
Ideally, if you can find a relationship, then you want to be able to use that rela-
tionship to make financial predictions. For example, if it’s possible to determine 
what your costs will look like next week by measuring the temperature today, then 
temperature is a good thing to know. If the weather report says it will be  
90 degrees next week, can you use that information to predict your corporate costs?
Any correlations that you identify and can use to predict financial movement are 
highly prized.
You can also use multiple variables to create more accurate correlations. These 
multivariate regressions attempt to show how each variable influences the thing 
you’re measuring and that, when used together, you can create an even more 
accurate model. This model not only explains what is causing changes in the thing 
you are measuring, but also how much of a role each variable plays and how you 
can use that to predict what will happen in the future. For this book, I’m going to 
stick with just a simple regression, though.
Doing a regression analysis
You can do a regression analysis using Microsoft Excel:
1.	 In cells A1 and A2, title each column with the label of the type of data 
that is used in each.
For example, you can use labels such as “Temp” and “Costs.”

274      PART 5  Financial Management
2.	 In column A, below the title, start inputting the appropriate data.
For example, you can include the temperature on a given day with a new value 
in each cell.
3.	 In column B, below the title, input the proper data.
Be very careful to match the proper data together. For example, if you’re 
including the cost for a particular day in a cell of column B, make sure that it’s 
next to the correct temperature for the same day.
4.	 Use the Excel function LINEST.
For “Known_y’s” include all of one column, including the title. For “Known_x’s” 
use all of the other column.
5.	 Press Enter to get a decimal value.
The closer to 1 that value is, the stronger the relationship. The closer to 0 that 
value is, the weaker the relationship. A value of 1 means that a perfect correla-
tion exists, while a value of 0 means no correlation exists at all. If the number is 
positive, it’s a positive correlation; if it’s negative, you have a negative correlation.
As a side note, if you can identify the influences on your finances, you can manage 
those influences to make them work in your favor. You are empowered to change 
your financial future.
Seeing the Future Unclouded: Forecasting
Financial forecasts are used in just about every aspect of corporate finance. Bud-
geting, investing, risk assessment, financing, inventory management, production 
schedules, hiring . . . basically anything that involves money is subject to financial 
forecasting. I’m serious when I say people obsess over money, and they want to 
know everything about it, including what will happen in the future. After you ana-
lyze your data, you can provide predictions of the future.
The forecast itself is often nothing more than a prediction of what is going to hap-
pen, typically including the probability of the prediction being correct and a range 
of other values that could also occur, with an explanation for the deviation. Often, 
you can explain these forecasts to someone in under a minute, if really necessary, 
but forecasters usually provide more information than just the basics.
Using statistics and probability
To forecast your finances, you watch for trends, patterns, and relationships, 
determine the probability of these influencing a particular outcome, and use that 

CHAPTER 19  Forecasting Finances      275
information to model your forecast. For instance, if government indicators predict 
that the economy is going to grow by 4 percent next year and you have identified 
a correlation between economic growth and net sales in a ½ ratio, then you can 
predict that the economic growth will contribute to a 2 percent sales increase next 
year. Does that mean that sales will increase 2 percent next year? Only if nothing 
else influences your sales, because other factors may influence sales to make them 
higher or lower. All you know from this trend is that economic growth will have a 
bit of a positive influence on your sales.
CALCULATING THE ALTMAN’S Z-SCORE
An interesting case of statistical financial projections is the Altman’s Z-score. This calcula-
tion is 72 percent accurate in predicting that a corporation will file for bankruptcy within 
the next two years. While not spectacularly accurate (better models are now out there), 
the Altman’s Z-score is a very simple equation to use and is accurate enough to prove a 
point. Here’s how the equation works:
Z

Where:

T5 = Net Sales/Total Assets
Risk score ratings:
>3 = As risky as eating soup while wearing water-wings (very low risk of bankruptcy)
1.81–2.99 = As risky as jumping off the high-dive in loose-fitting swim trunks (moder-
ate risk of bankruptcy)
<1.80 = As risky as swimming with sharks after taking a meat-bath (high risk of 
bankruptcy)

276      PART 5  Financial Management
Based on consistent trends over each month of the last three years of a steady  
1 percent monthly sales increase, you may predict that you’ll continue to see 
steady growth over the next several years, but with a 68 percent probability of 
slowed growth as you find patterns where sales slowed every fourth year. Perhaps 
you can’t figure out which variables are influencing that slowed growth, but after 
calculating the probability, you determine that your sales have a definite possibil-
ity of a temporary slow-down.
Using reference class forecasting
One type of forecasting that you should save for last is called reference class fore-
casting. Reference class forecasting involves finding a similar precedent set in the 
past for the thing you are trying to predict and then using the outcome of that 
scenario to check whether your forecast is reasonable compared to what has hap-
pened historically.
This approach is very prone to variations, given that the context in which events 
occur can change dramatically. Therefore, performing other calculations first will 
help you avoid bias or guiding scenarios (situations wherein your opinion is shaped 
by preconceived notions rather than the data). Then, when you perform a refer-
ence class forecast and the data doesn’t match expectations based on your refer-
ence, you might be able to identify what caused it to be so different.
Evaluating forecast performance
You can use two primary methods to evaluate financial forecasting performance: 
time and accuracy. Forecasters are considered more successful when they can 
predict either when something will occur or the degree to which something will 
change. If a forecaster predicts that revenues will jump in July, but sales drop in 
July only to jump in August, then the forecaster isn’t very accurate. If the fore-
caster predicts that sales will jump by 10 percent and sales actually jump by  
11 percent, then that’s bad as well.
Now, of course, a few variables (such as production capacity, for example) do 
influence how those differences in forecasts are interpreted. If sales jump by  
11 percent instead of 10 percent and this prevents the corporation from producing 
enough to meet demand, then its executives will be angry at the forecasters, even 
though they were only 1 percent off in their forecast.

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      277
Chapter 20
Getting the Deets 
on M&A
T
he concept of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is probably the most well-
known business finance concept thanks to pop-culture movies like The Wolf 
of Wall Street, but it is also probably one of the least well-understood. Like 
most business financial operations, the process of M&A can be broken down into 
steps that are so broad that they can be applied to just about anything without any 
real meaning, but that doesn’t stop people from doing it: strategy development, 
establishing criteria, searching for target, applied planning, valuation, negotia-
tion, purchasing, financing, implementation. If you are confused by this, you are 
not alone. In this chapter, the real motives and methods behind M&A activity are 
described in a way that makes sense.
Dissecting M&A
M&A stands for mergers and acquisitions. At the heart of all M&A is the idea of 
corporate integration. Companies can make corporate integration happen in sev-
eral ways that aren’t technically mergers or acquisitions, but the term M&A has 
entered the lexicon of public phrases and made popular worldwide. M&A activity 
can also refer to the splitting up of companies; either selling, stopping, or

otherwise parting with operations that were once part of a single company. So, on 
the whole, M&A is a field that deals with an odd trait inherent in corporations — 
that is, their ability to combine, divide, become each other, become something 
else, and otherwise interact in a very permeable manner with other corporations.
M&A is a complicated issue that involves a lot of consideration about the potential 
for a number of different things to integrate well, including the corporations’ 
operations, their management, corporate culture, their branding, their marketing 
and distribution, and a great number of other issues. M&A isn’t purely a financial 
concern, not by a long shot, but these are all secondary considerations for execu-
tives as they determine whether a merger will work only after they’ve already 
determined there’s potential for financial benefit.
In other words, the primary motivation for M&A will always be money. After it’s 
been established that there’s money to be made, then it becomes time to do all the 
extra work to determine whether it’s possible to tap into the metaphorical gold 
mine.
That being said, a corporation can make money through M&A in a number of dif-
ferent ways. Two corporations that are individual from each other don’t stand to 
benefit if they integrate their two respective organizations only to keep earnings 
and market share between them unchanged. There must be some form of gain 
from the synergy between the two corporations.
Yes, I know synergy is one of those seemingly nonsensical management terms that 
never seems to work out, but that’s primarily the result of ineffective M&A. A 
great number of motivations are behind M&A, but far too many companies are too 
anxious to participate in such activities and tend to either underestimate the dif-
ficulty of making it happen or assume that any M&A will benefit the company 
without evaluating the value of the proposed integration. In other words, synergy 
has become a bad word because it’s used too often as the sole justification for 
M&A, rather than determining what synergy will come out of the decision. That’s 
just bad management.
When it comes to M&As, you have one big consideration: the legal consideration. 
A lot of anti-trust law around the world says that corporations can’t integrate 
their operations in certain ways or, sometimes at all, if it significantly changes 
competition in the industry. If two corporations decide they want to merge, but 
only three corporations offer that particular product, then odds are the govern-
ment is going to stop them from merging, sometimes fining them for predatory 
business practices. If the corporations are based in one nation that allows the 
merger, but they also have operations overseas, they may very likely end up get-
ting fined in only one of those nations. This can be very expensive both in terms 

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      279
of fines as well as in terms of expenditures on the M&A-in-progress, so it’s better 
to assess the anti-trust implications of any M&A before even making the attempt.
The ultimate goal for any M&A activity is to make money. That’s really the pri-
mary motivation behind all the activities of corporations — by law, it has to be. 
It’s not as if you sign an M&A agreement, and money just appears out of the sky, 
though. The M&A fairy doesn’t appear in the middle of the night and fill your 
pockets with cash when you integrate corporations. The executives in charge need 
to know how to extract that money from the arrangement, to derive value from 
integrating, to milk that cow for all it’s worth!
M&A can improve corporate financial performance in several different ways. The 
financial aftermath of any M&A is where you differentiate between managers who 
know what they are doing and those that are just pretending. This is all very 
dependent on the ability of managers to recognize in advance that money can be 
made by integrating companies.
If you agree to integration and simply assume that it’s for the best, then you are 
guessing and should probably get a different job. If you can define exactly how 
money is going to be made and project how much money can be made, then you 
truly understand your motivations for M&A and have my permission to move for-
ward with the deal — not that you were asking, but isn’t it nice knowing that I 
approve?
The following sections cover some of the most common motivations for M&A, 
cover how money can be made from each of the individual motivations, and 
describe exactly who is making that money.
Diversification
Diversification means the same thing here as it does with investment portfolios; 
it’s the process of making something more varied. With investment portfolios, 
diversification means holding unrelated investments to avoid risk and volatility 
for the whole portfolio caused by maybe just one or two investments. In M&A, 
diversification refers to attempts to make the product portfolio or operations 
more varied.
Diversification can be quite financially beneficial, but you must be careful.
Imagine that you own a stationery company. Your business does pretty well, but 
you make the majority of your sales during the fall and winter (back-to-school 
season and the school year). You’re profitable on average, but during the spring 
and summer months (half the year), you simply aren’t selling enough to make up 
for the cost of operations during those months. Then you notice a manufacturer of 

280      PART 5  Financial Management
paper plates and napkins with the exact opposite problem: sales during barbecue 
season, but then nothing during the winter. After some discussions, you come to 
realize that the manufacturing processes for both your products are almost iden-
tical, and the two companies could merge, diversifying both your product lines in 
a single manufacturing facility. You’ve just doubled your product portfolio (sta-
tionery and now paper dinnerware) and are now generating more consistent rev-
enues by doing so. Rather than reinventing the wheel, so to speak, you simply 
merged with another company, allowing everyone to take advantage of the skills 
of the other.
Financially, this merger means greater revenues, less volatile earnings, and more 
efficient operations through lower average overhead per unit of output. Congrat-
ulations: Your M&A was a success!
Geographic expansion
M&A is a very popular way to expand into foreign markets or new areas within the 
same nation that are already dominated by established competitors. M&A allows 
the corporation to expand into these territories while utilizing a name that’s 
already recognizable and people who already have expertise in the area. M&A is a 
great way to enter into new markets and increase total sales. If you’re lucky, M&A 
could also mean generating economies of scale (see the next section).
The Daimler merger with Chrysler was primarily motivated by geographic expan-
sion. Daimler is a German company with nearly no presence in the United States, 
while Chrysler was faltering but still had a prominent presence. Daimler saw 
merging with Chrysler as an opportunity to enter into the very lucrative American 
automotive market, going as far as to begin labeling certain lines such as the Jeep 
Grand Cherokee with Daimler branding.
Economies of scale
Have you ever bought anything in large quantities because it was cheaper than 
buying smaller, more functional quantities? If you’ve ever been in a big-box 
retailer such as Costco or Sam’s Club, then odds are you have. My family buys 
paper towels in cases of 12 rolls (with four kids, you almost have to) because it’s 
cheaper per roll than buying 1 or 2 at a time, and paper towels don’t expire (as far 
as I know) so we know we’ll use them. Buying in bulk saves money. That’s basi-
cally how economies of scale works: Operate in larger quantities to make produc-
tion cheaper per unit.
Say that you have a machine that produces 1,000 units per year. “Units of what?” 
It doesn’t matter, but the machine produces 1,000 of them per year. You sell only 

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      281
500 units per year, though. So, if you have overhead of $1,000 per year and you’re 
only selling 500 units per year, then you have an average overhead of $2 per unit 
($1,000 in overhead/500 units = $2 per unit).
You decide to perform a little M&A to get into a foreign market, which increases 
sales to 1,000 units per year. Your overhead is staying the same, which means your 
average overhead has reduced to just $1 per unit ($1,000 in overhead/1,000 units =  
$1 per unit). You’ve just reduced your overhead per unit by 50 percent through 
M&A. Mazel tov!
Economies of scope
Economies of scope, like economies of scale, is about reducing average cost of 
production. Unlike economies of scale, those seeking economies of scope are 
attempting to reduce average costs by offering different product lines that utilize 
much of the same resources.
If two companies that manufacture stationery and paper plates merge, the newly 
merged company is working out of a single manufacturing facility, which greatly 
reduces the overhead to produce the products both of them were making using 
two facilities. This increase in production for equivalent fixed costs is also a form 
of economies of scale.
Another example is Kimberly Clark, a conglomerate that sells a huge range of 
personal care goods. These products all utilize the same branding, marketing, 
design, and things of that nature, so the indirect costs associated with the sup-
porting activities (for example, marketing, accounting, and so on) can be applied 
to a wider range of products, reducing their cost per unit.
Vertical integration
Vertical integration occurs when a corporation acquires another company that is up 
or down the supply chain in the same industry. When a company acquires a com-
pany that it sources from, it’s considered backward integration, while the acquisi-
tion of a company that it sells to is forward integration.
For example, take a theoretical paper company. Theoretical Paper, Inc. (aka: TP) 
decides it’s about time for a little M&A. What it really wants to do is some vertical 
integration — no real reason for it other than the CEO’s kid read about it in the 
newspaper one day. So TP looks up the supply chain to see whether it can acquire 
a packager, distributor, or retailer. Nothing would be financially feasible for them 
integrating upstream. So, TP looks downstream, and what does it find? It’s a lum-
ber company with the rights to tree farms that provide lumber to all the paper 

282      PART 5  Financial Management
companies in their market. Oh, glorious day! The acquisition of this company 
gives TP greater control over the market — the capability of not only profiting 
from the efforts of its competitors, but also access to all the best lumber before 
anyone else has a chance to buy it! This acquisition puts TP in a position to increase 
sales through a better-quality product than the competition, lower prices by gain-
ing access to lumber cheaper than the competition, or simply putting the compe-
tition out of business by refusing to provide them with lumber.
Horizontal integration
Whereas vertical integration focuses on combining corporations at different levels 
in the supply chain, horizontal integration focuses in combining different corpora-
tions at the same level in the supply chain. Horizontal integration is extremely 
common in tech companies, where developers will acquire other developers or 
manufacturers will acquire different manufacturers. They do it not only to elimi-
nate competitors (see the later section called “Elimination of competitors”), but 
also to gain the rights to new ideas and patents and to increase market share to 
compete against more established companies. In all cases, the point is to either 
cut costs or increase revenues.
Conglomerate integration
Conglomerate integration, unlike the other forms of integration, is the acquisition 
by one corporation of a company that is nowhere in the same supply chain, either 
horizontally or vertically. To the untrained eye, it may seem as if these forms of 
integration have no more benefit than simply the additional revenues generated 
by investing in another company. If you look a little bit closer, though, you can 
often see much, much more.
For example, say that a bank buys a car dealership. Confused, many people may 
think this move is just about diversification. If you watch the types of loans being 
made by the bank, though, you’ll most likely see that the number of car loans it 
issues increases dramatically. This integration is conglomerate integration 
because the two companies aren’t in the same business, but they do complement 
each other. The bank still operates normally, but perhaps it now provides loans to 
the dealership it owns at lower rates than otherwise possible with a standard 
financing agreement.
Elimination of competitors
M&A is a very common way for larger companies to eliminate potential competi-
tors from the pool of smaller but quickly growing companies. In 2007, for 

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      283
example, Coca-Cola acquired Energy Brands, a company that produces several 
lines of bottled water. It recognized the growing demand for bottled water and 
other sugar-free beverages as a replacement for soda as the populations around 
the world become more health-conscious, picked one of the more promising com-
panies in that trend, and bought it. Coca-Cola has now eliminated one of its com-
petitors by simply buying it, while also diversifying their product portfolio with a 
product competing with its primary line of products.
Manager compensation
Though not exactly the most financially sound motivation, nor the most honest, 
compensation packages have been a primary motivation for far more than one 
case of M&A. These are actions taken by individuals seeking self-benefit (such as 
receiving bonuses for short-term performance manipulation, receiving golden 
parachutes, manipulating greenmail circumstances, and so on), rather than those 
making the best decision. It stinks, yes, but it’s a very common mindset among 
corporate executives.
M&A is a big deal, even for large corporations. A lot of money gets shifted around 
very quickly when it comes to M&A deals. As a result of the deals themselves and 
the short-term aftermath, frequently executives are in a position of personally 
making a ton of money. I can’t say I entirely blame them; who couldn’t stand to 
benefit from an extra two or three digits on their paycheck? Of course, this extra 
income is usually at the harm of the long-term financial health of the company, 
but, right or wrong, income is often a primary motivator in decisions to partici-
pate in M&A, or at least the decision to start looking for M&A partners.
Synergistic operations
More and more, the world is beginning to see M&A based on operations between 
corporations that match well, but not for supply chain or competitive reasons. For 
example, more integration between manufacturing firms and energy companies 
is occurring wherein the heat or smoke from a processing plant that normally gets 
disbursed into the air is utilized to produce electricity and sold back to the utility 
companies. Proposals between transportation infrastructure companies that spe-
cialize in bridges partner with wind energy companies to incorporate turbines into 
their designs. A lot of it is focused on the philosophy of “one person’s trash is 
another treasure,” all designed, of course, to cut costs and generate revenues 
between them both.

Moving Beyond the M and the A
What’s the difference between a merger and an acquisition, and how do you rec-
ognize each or any other form of corporate integration? The differences between 
each form of integration can really be quite subtle on an operational level but still 
result in significant financial differences in the long run. These small but signifi-
cant variations in integration techniques are, more than anything, legal variances, 
but these legal variances define exactly who has ownership over what and what 
assets and resources they are entitled to, including corporate earnings.
The following sections look at each of the most common forms of corporate integra-
tion and what makes each unique. I also assess real-world examples of each form of 
integration done by large corporations and see how that worked out for them.
Mergers
A merger is really a rather strange thing. A merger occurs when two companies 
become each other or, more specifically, both companies cease to exist, and a new 
company is formed out of the operations of both. The stockholders have their 
shares reorganized under the new company, and all operations fall under a new 
set of executive management, which usually consists of a combination of the 
management from the two-individual organization prior to the merger. This type 
of arrangement is usually considered to be a merger of equals, or a combining of 
corporations on equal terms. In reality, though, the larger or more financially 
healthy company tends to assimilate the other.
THE VALMET/NELES MERGER
In 2021, two Finnish industrial firms merged into a single corporation. Valmet Corp and 
Neles Oyj operated in the same industry but tended to be dedicated to different markets 
within it. The goal was not only to expand the market size of the newly-combined organi-
zation, but also to leverage each other’s resources to reduce their respective cost of oper-
ations. “The transaction creates a global industrial leader with a bright future beyond 
what we could achieve separately,” said Valmet Chairman Mikael Makinen. “Together our 
businesses are better positioned to drive innovation and leadership in sustainability.” 
Logistically, the merger occurred as Neles shareholders receive 0.3277 shares of the new 
organization for every share they currently own. The result is that Neles shareholders 
own 18.8 percent of the new organization, while Valmet shareholders own the remaining 
amount. This clearly indicates that Valmet was a more valuable company going into the 
merger, but the exchanging of shares in this manner instead of the purchasing of Neles 
shares by Valmet means that this is, in fact, a proper merger rather than an acquisition.

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      285
Although a merger is, technically, a combination of corporations to form a new 
one, which may imply a level legal playing field in the terms of the merger, the 
reality isn’t so simple. It’s quite typical that mergers tend to occur between cor-
porations wherein one has a dominant place in the market, allowing that corpora-
tion more leverage to maintain managerial control over not only the merger 
process but also how operations are run after the merger is complete. This control 
includes how finances are managed and representation in management, as well.
Why do mergers happen so frequently? It’s a financial strategy. For corporations 
and large companies, some other forms of M&A carry negative connotations. Call-
ing an integration a merger, which implies equality in the integration, allows both 
companies to maintain a positive image, thereby maintaining the market value of 
the stock of both companies. If one company was acquiring the other, it may 
imply to investors that the acquired company was troubled or overvalued, causing 
the market value of the equity to drop and reducing confidence in the newly inte-
grated entity.
Acquisitions
So, what the heck is an acquisition, anyway? An acquisition differs from a merger 
because it doesn’t combine two companies. Rather, in an acquisition, one com-
pany purchases the other as you would purchase a car.
Acquisitions are a bit more flexible than mergers in respect to the legal organiza-
tion of each company, but the one true hallmark of an acquisition is that one 
corporation then owns another after the acquisition process is complete.
Not all acquisitions are considered bad things. When a smaller company is being 
acquired by a much larger company, the larger company quite frequently appreci-
ates the value of the smaller company, which is especially true of corporations 
that are already known to be troubled, and their stock has already responded to 
the financial difficulties appropriately by dropping in value. In this case, even 
rumors of an acquisition can raise the price of the company’s stock as investors 
believe that being acquired by a company with more assets or better management 
may give the struggling company the jump start it needs to be more successful.
Corporate integration, especially during mergers or acquisitions (not in joint 
ventures, partnerships, or other less-integrated arrangements) tends to be 
strongly scrutinized for monopolistic behaviors. This is especially true when the 
arrangement results in a significant reduction of competition between corpora-
tions that control a majority of the market, or which allows for significant influ-
ence to be had over the supply chain.

286      PART 5  Financial Management
Let’s take a look at two of the options that might influence the acquisition.
»
» Organizational sovereignty is kind of an odd term. I’m referring to whether the 
acquired corporation remains a company in its own right or not. Remember 
that companies can own other companies and that the acquiring company 
has the option to merely make the acquired company a single branch or 
division of their other operations rather than allowing it to stay an indepen-
dent entity. So, in many cases, a corporation may just purchase a controlling 
share of the acquired company’s stock, giving it the ability to manage it from a 
distance but never fully integrating the two organizations. On the other hand, 
the acquired company may simply cease to exist, instead becoming a single 
division of the acquiring company.
»
» Another variable is whether the acquisition is a full acquisition or a partial one. 
In a partial acquisition, the acquiring company is required to purchase just 
greater than 50 percent of the equity in the acquired company. This amount 
gives the acquiring company a controlling ownership, allowing it to manage 
the acquired corporation however it wants. A partial acquisition does, 
however, limit the acquiring company’s ability to completely integrate the 
company’s operations because private shareholders still remain.
In other words, in partial acquisitions, the acquired corporation will remain a 
corporation. In a full acquisition, the acquiring company purchases the total value 
of the acquired company and has the option to make that company simply a part 
of its own operations.
THE AMD ACQUISITION OF XILINX
In 2021, the technology giant AMD acquired another major technology company called 
Xilinx. The process, which began in 2020, first drew strong criticism. AMD specializes pri-
marily in the development of computer CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs 
(graphics processing units) using semiconductors. Xilinx was a major manufacturer of 
semiconductors, causing AMD’s competitors like Intel to be concerned that the acquisi-
tion would give AMD an unfair advantage in sourcing their supplies or otherwise con-
trolling the supply chain. The issue was filed as an anti-trust concern with the European 
Commission (an economic oversight board in the European Union), which tends to be 
much stricter than oversight boards in the United States. Eventually the EU gave the 
green light to AMD to go forward with the acquisition, though. Had the EU decided that 
this represented anti-competitive behavior, the entire acquisition may have been 
cancelled.

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      287
Buyouts
A buyout occurs when one corporation buys a controlling share of stock in another. 
A buyout is very similar to a partial acquisition. Some argue there’s no difference, 
which isn’t surprising because the difference is subtle at best. Note that the pri-
mary difference between a buyout and other forms of M&A is that a controlling 
share of stock is used, rather than a stock swap, purchase of other forms of equity, 
or other possibilities of acquisition. So, in a buyout, a controlling share of stock is 
purchased. Another subtle nuance occurs when that controlling share is purchased 
by borrowing more money or by having an IPO. When a company raises additional 
money for the sole purpose of controlling another company, it’s called a leveraged 
buyout.
The use of the buyout is popular among venture capitalists and investors. It is a 
favorite method of Berkshire Hathaway and many others for gaining control and 
expanding one’s operations very quickly without intention of ever integrating 
those additional operations. A buyout is sort of an arm’s-length approach, where 
the purchased corporation is expected to maintain a high degree of the autonomy 
it always had, but the purchasing entity intends to take advantage of the increased 
reach or earnings generated after the buyout.
The term “M&A” is really just a colloquial summary. Corporate integration takes 
a wide variety of forms, though, and can be performed in a wide variety of ways.
Factoring
Factoring is a much less integrated way to integrate. It’s a one-time deal (which 
can be repeated in the future, but each deal takes place only once rather than 
ongoing) that is relatively short term and keeps both organizations totally inde-
pendent of each other. The way factoring works is that one company sells its 
accounts receivables to another at a discount. So, the acquiring company is really 
only acquiring the future cash flows on the acquired company’s accounts receiv-
ables, meaning that it’s purchasing part of the company’s future revenues. Usu-
ally, the purchase price on such a deal will only be somewhere between 5 to  
20 percent of the total value, depending on the quality of the accounts receivables, 
the receivables turnover in years, and other variables.
In this way, one company can acquire the operations of another but only specific 
operations and certainly within a limited timeframe rather than a permanent and 
total acquisition.

288      PART 5  Financial Management
Joint ventures
More commonly corporations want to work together on a specific project but 
don’t want to merge their other operations. When this is the case the corporations 
negotiate a contract in which each allocates assets into a new organization. The 
co-ownership of a new business is called a joint venture. These are popular because 
it allows businesses to each utilize the strengths of the other, but the arrangement 
doesn’t require any actual modification to their own core operations.
Partnerships
Partnerships are even less integrated than joint ventures. In a partnership there 
isn’t necessarily a new organization that is formed. It isn’t necessarily a new divi-
sion or department. Sometimes multiple companies will simply work together on 
a new product or marketing strategy. It’s common for companies that provide 
commodity goods (things which aren’t easily discernible between competing pro-
viders, like precious metal or agricultural goods) to partner-up on an advertising 
campaign that promotes the industry as a whole.
Licensing agreements
When one company has some operation or product, or brand or skill set that other 
companies want to use then it may opt to offer licenses. Licenses allow others to 
utilize resources owned by the issuing company for a fee. It is extremely common 
for franchises to pay a fee for the rights to use the name and branding of the head 
corporation. Right now, the mobile carrier I use is very small company that has a 
license to hook its own network up to the major telecommunications equipment 
owned by Sprint.
Hostile takeovers
A hostile takeover is really quite the same thing as a regular buyout or acquisition. 
The thing that makes such a takeover hostile is the fact that it occurs without the 
consent of the management of the acquired company.
A hostile takeover occurs in a few ways:
»
» A proxy fight occurs wherein a majority of shareholders of the target company 
are convinced to vote out the current board of directors and replace them 
with a board that will agree to the takeover.

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      289
»
» A company buys up a controlling share of equity on the secondary market.
»
» A company purchases the debt of a troubled company and gains control over 
their assets through bankruptcy.
In any case, the end result of a hostile takeover is the same as a normal acquisition 
or buyout, but it’s just done by force.
Divesting Is Investing
You’ve done awful, terrible things during your time managing M&A, and as a 
result of your incompetence, not only will you have nightmares for the rest of your 
life for what you’ve done, but the corporation you worked for now needs to get rid 
of your acquisitions. Well, maybe your huge executive severance package will ease 
the nightmares, but the reality is that the company now has operations it doesn’t 
want anymore. In cases like this, or in any case where a company is looking to get 
rid of some of their operations, they will go through something called a 
divestiture.
Divestiture is a broad term that can include several different potential methods for 
accomplishing the same thing: getting rid of assets. In the case of M&A, if a  
division/branch/operation within the company can’t stand alone as a company, 
then it will likely just shut down those operations and liquidate the hard assets for 
whatever it can get for them. If that division/branch/operation has the potential 
to operate independently of the corporation, then it will likely spin off into its own 
company. In other words, it will stop being a part of the larger company and just 
operate independently.
One example of this happening occurred in 2007 when Daimler sold its Chrysler 
operations to a capital investing firm. This divestiture came following weak sales 
by Chrysler and an inability by Daimler to do anything successful with it. Chrysler 
was sold and later repurchased by another automotive manufacturer, Fiat. Daim-
ler is a perfect example of a merger-gone-wrong that later resulted in a divesti-
ture. Daimler decided it was better to sell the division for what it could and take 
the loss rather than lose everything trying to fix a company it didn’t have the 
ability to help. The proverbial “money pit” applies to all levels of investments, not 
just homes or cars.

290      PART 5  Financial Management
Measuring What a Business  
Is Worth to You
Say that you’ve found a company with which you’d like to dance the M&A mambo. 
You know exactly what benefits you hope to gain from integration operations, 
you’re confident in your financial projections for the return on investment, you’ve 
picked the best company with whom to integrate, and you even know the type of 
M&A in which you want to participate. So, you call up its CEO and tell him you’re 
ready to buy. The first question the CEO is going to ask you, besides whether 
you’re crazy (no one really just calls up the CEO and asks for a merger) is how 
much you’re willing to offer! Uh oh. Now what?
Walk down any street in your own industrial or commercial districts (you can rec-
ognize these areas because they have a lot of companies or stores rather than 
homes) and look at the buildings. Walk around to the back and keep looking. Do 
you see a price tag for the sale of the business? Of course not; that would be silly. 
Businesses don’t typically just advertise that they’re for sale and at what price 
they’re being sold. These transactions are all handled through very careful finan-
cial valuations, usually done separately by both parties who then meet to negoti-
ate price.
For corporations, this transaction almost always includes a shareholder vote as 
well. The shareholders have the right to turn down the acquisition or, if they don’t 
want to turn it down outright, voice their concern about pricing so that the price 
can be renegotiated. Often, the price is set as a proportion exchange in stocks, the 
purchase price of a controlling interest in stock at an agreed upon price per share, 
the exchange of assets or liabilities, or simply an outright purchase.
Exactly how corporations assess the price they’re willing to pay for an acquisition 
is very involved, though. This is not an expensive purchase in the same way that 
paying $100 for a pair of shoes is expensive; this is far, far, far more money. So, it 
should come as no surprise that when you’re dealing with sums totaling millions 
or billions of dollars, corporations tend to be very meticulous and very careful 
about their financial evaluations of value and price.
Corporations use several methods to evaluate the purchase price of a company. In 
fact, several methods are typically used, compared, evaluated, compared again, 
and then some average or estimate is developed using some combination of those 
evaluation methods. The truth is, though, that each individual method is not that 
difficult. The tricky part is trusting whether you’re correct. If you have differen-
tials in the estimated price between the different methods you’ve used, you need 
to determine why that differential exists and what price to use.

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      291
Future cash flows
So, what methods are used to evaluate price for M&A? Really, it depends a lot on 
the type of M&A. For factoring, it’s almost exclusively a discounted price of the 
book value on future cash flows. In other words, if the future cash flows are worth 
$100 in nominal value, then likely the price of purchase is going to be around  
$85 to account for the time value of money and credit risk. Partnerships and joint 
ventures don’t really have a purchase price; rather, the corporations tend to come 
to an agreement regarding the amount of investment, types of investment, and 
relative proportion share of the income earned. For example, if both corporations 
are contributing 50 percent of the investment, then they’ll each likely earn  
50 percent of the income generated from the venture.
These deals tend to get a little more complicated when one corporation is invest-
ing intangible assets like expertise, but then the market value of consulting or 
outsourcing that expertise or the market value of wages for hiring a similar posi-
tion are all common measures of the contribution of such intangible assets. Even 
for buyouts and hostile takeovers, often the analysis is no more complex than 
those used for investing in the stock of these companies, utilizing the investor 
analytics discussed within this book. The book value of the company, the market 
value, or combinations of both are used in conjunction with these metrics in order 
to determine whether the company is over- or underpriced in regard to what that 
company is asking for payment in the acquisition.
Control premiums
The other forms of valuations, the ones really worth discussing in detail, are the 
mergers and the acquisitions. How does one company place a value on another 
company in these cases? Typically, professional reports developed by M&A firms 
are extremely detailed, assessing every aspect of the business. These reports are 
always done from the perspective of the acquiring corporation because the  
benefits that are generated for such a firm are indefinite, while the sale price is a 
one-time transaction (potentially broken up into several payments).
This is why it’s common for companies to pay something called a control 
premium — an amount paid for a company that is more than the actual value of 
the company. It’s a bit like buying rental property at puffed-up prices for the 
income potential. This is done when it’s believed that the acquiring firm can 
derive more value from the acquired company than the acquired company is cur-
rently able to produce on their own. For example, a company may be worth  
$1 million, but the acquiring company feels that it can make that company more 
successful than it currently is by utilizing economies of scope, so it’s willing to 
pay $1.25 million instead, expecting to generate positive returns on investment 
beginning in five years and continuing each year indefinitely. Sure, sounds like a 
good plan, but how did they figure that out?

292      PART 5  Financial Management
First and easiest, comparing the book value of the company and the market value 
of the company is a great way to get started. The book value is found in the balance 
sheet and is just the total value of all their assets minus the value of intangible 
assets and liabilities. It’s the sum of all the physical assets the company owns 
minus the debt it holds. That number tells you what you could get for that com-
pany if you just decided to sell it off based on the total amount paid by the com-
pany for its assets (which can be optimistically high if the company is doing 
poorly, or pessimistically low if the company has a lot of future potential for earn-
ings).Of course, most M&A isn’t motivated by this intention. Now compare that to 
the market value of the corporation — that is, the total number of shares of stock 
outstanding times the market price per share. If nothing else, that will tell you 
what market sentiment is for this company, as well as what you could make off of 
selling its assets in a worst-case scenario.
Company worth by comparison
Another method is to simply compare the company in question to the sale price of 
other comparable companies. Now, there may not be any companies that are per-
fectly matched for such a comparison, but this analysis still provides valuable 
information. Just as if you were buying a house and you wanted to set a sort of 
baseline value to compare one house to another, figuring out what companies of 
the same relative size are worth will tell you how much over or under the average 
the company in question is selling for. In addition, figuring out how much com-
panies in the same industry but of different size are worth will also help provide 
valuable information of what market expectations of price will be relative to their 
size, industry, earnings, or similar evaluations. That brings me to the next 
evaluation.
Cash-flow evaluation
The cash-flow method of evaluating a company is a little trickier. Using historical 
data and sales projection for the next several years, it becomes possible to deter-
mine the future cash flows for the corporation. Using the present value of future 
cash flows, the company can estimate exactly how much money it’ll generate off 
of the business. Now, the reason this evaluation becomes so tricky is that the 
company also has to consider how cash flows will change under the ownership of 
the corporation.
What will be the nature of the changes, and how will those changes influence 
costs, revenues, and profits? If this can all be determined within a reasonable 
estimated range, then it’s much easier to estimate the value of the corporation. If 
nothing else, it will tell you how long it will take to start generating a positive 
return on investment, if at all. Is the price set so high that you’ll never generate a 

CHAPTER 20  Getting the Deets on M&A      293
return? Will it take 100 years to generate a return? Using the time value of money, 
price negotiations for M&A will frequently measure price in years rather than in 
dollars, which may sound strange for some.
Measures of market share
Larger corporations may also use measures of market share. This method still 
eventually comes down to what that market share is worth, how much additional 
revenues will be generated using that market share, and the ability to expand on 
the newly acquired share, but particularly for high-competition industries, such 
as soda and tech, the value of market share can be very high. People with very high 
brand loyalty, say the competition between Coke and Pepsi, means that taking 
market share can be like digging through concrete using a wax spoon.
Price isn’t just set by valuation, however. The amount that the acquiring company 
can afford will play a big role. It’s not simply about what value they can extract out 
of the other company if they simply can’t afford the high price. The company 
being acquired must also be convinced that the price is fair, because if it’s too low, 
then it has little incentive for it to agree to M&A. This is more a matter of the 
company’s own asset availability than valuation, but it still plays a significant role 
in price-setting negotiations.
A number of other methods are used to value a business. These staples are included 
in pretty much all reports, and they’re very easy to do with a bit of practice. It 
doesn’t explain how the company intends to make the purchase, though.
Financing M&A
Like all investments, the method of payment plays a very significant role in deter-
mining whether the investment is feasible. There are a number of methods avail-
able to pay for M&A, each with their pros and cons.
»
» Cash: Cash is great. It’s cheap compared to other methods, it’s an instant 
transaction, and it’s mess-free (meaning that once it’s done, you don’t have to 
mess with it again). The problem is that you’re not talking about a small 
amount of cash. These sums are typically huge and not always available. Not 
many companies, much less individuals, carry around millions or billions in an 
easily accessible bank account.

294      PART 5  Financial Management
»
» Debt: Debt is expensive. If you’re taking out a loan or making payments over a 
longer period of time to the old owners, then odds are you’re paying interest. 
This is going to increase the cost of the purchase significantly and should be 
taken into consideration during the pricing process. The nice part is that debt 
is relatively easy to come by and is more flexible than cash when it comes to 
repayment plans.
Here’s a look at debt from another perspective. For companies that are deeply 
troubled, agreeing to accept the debt that the company has incurred is also an 
issue that can be accounted for in price. If a company is worth $100 but it 
owes $200 in debt, then agreeing to accept that debt will certainly lower or 
potentially eliminate the price of purchase.
»
» Equity: It’s not unheard of to have an IPO to afford M&A. This has the same 
benefits and detriments as having an IPO for any other reason, except with 
less investor backlash. Having an IPO just for fun tends to make investors 
believe that the stock is overvalued and the market price will drop, making the 
IPO generate fewer funds and depreciating the value of existing shares. Now, 
if it’s done in conjunction with M&A, often investors are more forgiving or 
even excited about the prospect, increasing the value of the IPO and existing 
shares — not a bad option if your stock can handle the extra shares 
outstanding.
Another way to look at equity is through a stock swap. Rather than raising 
money through an IPO, a corporation can be bought by swapping stock. The 
shareholders agree to give up their shares of stock in exchange for a set 
number of shares of the acquiring company’s stock. For example, sharehold-
ers of Company A may receive 1.2 shares of stock from the acquiring com-
pany for every 1 share of stock they hold of the acquired company. This 
transition of ownership in stock is quite common for merger.
»
» Hard assets: Particularly during joint ventures, it is common for companies to 
simply allocate the required equipment, buildings, and even workers neces-
sary to make the new project a success. This doesn’t require any kind of any 
actual exchange of value between the parent companies.

espite what you’ve been told, the world is a very large place, and the people 
within it vary quite a bit from each other. While this diversity makes the 
world a much more interesting place than it otherwise would be in a 
homogenous global population, these differences do cause some unique circum-
stances in corporate finance that you must understand, anticipate, and utilize to 
your benefit in order for the corporation to remain competitive. As advances in 
global communication, information, and transportation occur, it is not enough to 
simply remain domestically-minded, as “sticking your head in the sand” will do 
nothing more to blind you to the manner in which corporations around the world 
are already influencing your own company and your own life. This chapter dis-

There’s No Such Thing as  
a Trade Imbalance
When you go to an electronics store to buy a computer, you give the store owner 
money and, in return, the store owner gives you ownership of a computer. At no 
point in this exchange do either you or the store owner have a trade imbalance, 
because the value of goods and money being exchanged are equal. The store 
owner, having given a thing of value to you, is now in possession of a piece of 
paper that symbolizes the value of debt that society owes them in the form of 
goods and services. (Money is meaningless except as a measure of how many 
goods and services are owed.) The store owner holds onto the money you gave 
them for a little while and then uses it to purchase goods and services.
National trade works in a similar way. Nations keep track of all the trades they 
make in their balance of payments. The two primary accounts in the balance of 
payments are
»
» Current account: The current account measures the amount of consumable 
goods entering or leaving a country. (It’s what people are talking about when 
they discuss trade deficits and surpluses.) These goods may include food, 
cars, machinery, customer service, employment, or anything else being 
purchased. A current account deficit means a nation imports more goods than 
it exports; likewise, a current account surplus means a nation exports more 
than it imports.
»
» Capital account: The capital account consists of investments one nation 
makes in another nation’s economy, such as the value of new business 
startups, the value of stock and bond purchases, and even the transfer of 
money related to imports and exports. So, when Nation A exports goods to 
Nation B, it does so with the expectation that the currency Nation B gives it 
will later be traded for a greater amount of resources than Nation B gave it 
this time. In other words, the whole process of exporting is an investment. 
Here’s a more personal example: If a person tried to buy something from you 
by using some type of money that you couldn’t spend or convert into a 
useable type of money, would you still sell to that person? Of course not.
An increase in one of these accounts always results in a decrease in the other. So, 
when a nation has a current account deficit, it also has a capital account surplus.

CHAPTER 21  Ten Things You Need to Know about International Finance      299
A nation can sustain a current account deficit as long as the people of other nations 
are confident that they’ll be able to use the currency they receive for their exports 
to purchase other goods and services from the importing nation or other nations 
interested in the importing nation’s currency. The real issue is whether the value 
of the nation’s exports will increase over time relative to the value of its imports. 
In other words, a nation will want to know whether all the money its spending will 
boost the total value of its productivity in a manner that will allow it to meet its 
export obligations later (because other nations now hold their currency) while still 
maintaining enough production to meet domestic demand and whether corpora-
tions are treating imports as capital investments (hence, a capital account sur-
plus) or mere consumption. Take a look at the case study in the sidebar entitled 
“Cheap labor and the U.S. trade deficit,” to see what I mean.
CHEAP LABOR AND THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT
At the time of this writing, the United States has the largest current account deficit and 
the largest capital account surplus in the world. China is in the opposite position with 
the largest current account surplus and the largest capital account deficit. (Again, cur-
rent and capital accounts are very nearly exact opposites of each other.) In the United 
States, many people are afraid that their country is buying too much from China, but 
what they don’t understand is that it’s buying things from China for very little U.S. 
currency.
In 2007, a very hard recession hit the United States and much of Europe, causing prices 
to go down because people couldn’t afford to pay them. During that same period, China 
was nearly untouched by the recession, and people bought up more of its products 
because China kept the exchange rate low. As a result, prices in China increased along 
with wages (a process called inflation). If wages and prices in China continue to increase 
faster than in the United States, China will eventually be purchasing from the United 
States by using its huge U.S. currency reserves and a large middle class with tendencies 
to spend the majority of its earnings (by nature of their newfound ability to pursue the 
comfort goods previously not available to them). At the point where neither nation can 
achieve benefits of cheap labor and resources, they’ll trade with each other based on 
their relative advantages (the things each can produce more efficiently and, as a result, 
more cheaply than the other) rather than simply based on low income. The process by 
which this occurs between trade partners is called factor price equalization.

Purchasing Power and Exchange  
Rates Are Different Things
The purchasing power of a nation’s currency refers to that nation’s ability to pur-
chase goods. Usually purchasing power is measured using a list of necessities such 
as certain groceries, utilities, and other requirements for daily life, but for sim-
plicity’s sake, let’s say that purchasing power is measured in beer. (Yes, econo-
mists are very fond of using beer as an example. I’ll let you guess the reasons 
why.) Purchasing power by itself doesn’t really mean anything, but when used to 
track changes over time, it helps measure inflation. For example, if the price of 
beer goes up from $100 per keg to $101 per keg in a year, then the nation experi-
enced 1 percent inflation that year.
Purchasing power also comes into play when you’re comparing the ability of your 
money to buy something in your home country and the ability of a foreign cur-
rency to buy the same something in the foreign nation. This comparison is called 
purchasing power parity (PPP). For example, if $100 buys a keg of beer in the United 
States, but that exact same keg of beer, when bought in Great Britain, costs 124 
pounds, then the purchasing power parity of the pound in Great Britain to the dol-
lar in the United States is USD100 = GBP124, USD1 = GBP1.24. Probably the most 
famous way of measuring PPP is by using the Big Mac Index, which uses the price 
of a Big Mac in every nation to determine PPP.
Exchange rate, on the other hand, refers to how much foreign money you can buy 
with your money. As of this writing, you need $1.37 in U.S. dollars to purchase  
1 British pound. Note that the exchange rate is different from the PPP. If a nation 
has a very low exchange rate (meaning that you can buy a lot of its money for 
cheap) but the PPP in that nation is higher than your country’s PPP, then the two 
measurements tend to balance each other out as far as exports go. For instance, if 
Great Britain has a purchasing power that’s 1 percent higher than the United 
States and an exchange rate that’s 1 percent lower than the United States, then 
British prices would be the same as U.S. prices for any U.S. dollars that you 
exchange into pounds.
Interest Rates and Exchange Rates  
Have a Muddled Relationship
Particularly if you manage a multinational company, anticipating fluctuations in 
exchange rates can be an extremely important part of your company’s financial 
management success. So, what influences exchange rates?

CHAPTER 21  Ten Things You Need to Know about International Finance      301
The International Fisher Effect says that for every 1 percent differential that a nation 
has in its nominal interest rates over another nation, the currency of that nation 
will experience a 1 percent decrease in exchange rate via inflationary pressures 
associated with increased interest, increased consumption, and investment spec-
ulation. For example, if the United States has an interest rate of 10 percent and 
Mexico has an interest rate of 11 percent, then according to the International 
Fisher Effect, the exchange rate of the Mexican peso would drop by 1 percent rela-
tive to the U.S. dollar. This drop occurs because the United States’ relatively lower 
interest rates will stimulate consumption and capital investment in the nation, 
causing inflationary pressure to depreciate the value of the currency to both for-
eign investors and foreign traders.
That being said, the IFE itself is more of a “jumping-off point” meant to prove a 
point, while more elaborate models based on it have improved accuracy and use-
fulness. The International Fisher Effect tends to hold true only in a cluster forma-
tion soon after the interest-rate differential occurs because a change in interest 
rates happens only once while exchange rates are in an ongoing state of fluctua-
tion, you end up seeing a J curve when you graph the two rates. With the J curve, 
the exchange rate drops at first before rising up higher than the original point, 
forming a J shape when graphed. This pattern occurs as the exchange rate goes 
down at first but then goes back up as the lower exchange rate and devalued cur-
rency causes a nation’s exports to be relatively cheaper for people in other nations, 
attracting more trade over the long run.
In addition, many large nations, such as the United States, have very stable econ-
omies. U.S. Treasury bills, for instance, are considered “risk–free” investments, 
and U.S. Treasury bonds are considered to be extremely low risk, except in that 
interest rates may fluctuate, causing the future value of a low-interest bond to 
decrease. Even during record government debt, the U.S. government can still issue 
bills and bonds that yield next to 0 percent interest without too much trouble 
because when interest rates rise, the broad market infrastructure and openness to 
foreign investors maintains high levels of capital investment. On the other hand, 
some nations with smaller or more volatile economies lose a significant number 
of investors with lower interest rates because investors don’t want the additional 
risk without higher returns. Plus, such nations typically don’t have stable capital 
investments.
To summarize, the IFE allows corporations to forecast changes in exchange rates 
and international markets using current interest-rate differentials, but they may 
have to experiment mathematically a bit to make their forecasts accurate enough 
to be really useful.

302      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Spot Rate Isn’t the Only Type  
of Currency Transaction
A number of things influence exchange rates, but in the end, how are exchange 
rates decided when a floating currency is involved? The process works a lot like 
buying stock. The organizations that have foreign currency and are willing to sell 
it for domestic currency (or another foreign currency) tell people how much of the 
domestic currency they want to receive for their foreign currency. This is called 
the ask price. For example, the organizations may ask for 1.5 of the domestic cur-
rency for every 1 of their foreign currency. When people want to buy that foreign 
currency, the amount they’re willing to pay for it is called the bid price. For exam-
ple, a person may bid 1.3 of the domestic currency for every 1 of the foreign cur-
rency. The difference between the ask price and the bid price is called the spread, 
and no exchange can take place until either the buyer or seller (sometimes both) 
compromises on the final transaction price.
The price that’s agreed upon in this type of transaction is called the spot rate 
because it’s the exchange rate that has occurred right there on the spot. The 
majority of all foreign exchanges that individuals participate in are spot exchanges. 
For example, in all major international airports, you can exchange money in for-
eign exchange booths, where you get the spot rate of exchange. Because individual 
people don’t exchange enough to influence the exchange rate, you’re pretty much 
at the mercy of whatever price the booth is asking for the currency you want.
Even though the airport exchange broker rips you off after charging brokerage 
rates plus the exchange spread, as an individual, you’re really not dealing with a 
ton of money. So, you’re not risking much of a loss even if the exchange rate of the 
currency you bought drops suddenly, making your purchase worth much less than 
when you paid for it.
International companies and institutional investors, on the other hand, have quite 
a bit to be worried about. When these organizations exchange currency, they often 
do so in very large quantities.
Either to mitigate risk or (too often) to generate more income by speculating on 
the exchange, professionals rely on other types of exchanges than the spot trans-
action. Most of these exchanges are similar to the other risk management trans-
actions that I describe in Chapter 16. Here’s a quick look at a few of them:
»
» Future and forward transactions: These exchanges are contracted to take 
place in the future at a price agreed upon immediately, giving a guaranteed 
transaction rate regardless of what happens to the market rate between the 
contract signing and the delivery date. The difference between forward 

CHAPTER 21  Ten Things You Need to Know about International Finance      303
transactions and future transactions (sometimes called futures) is primarily 
that futures are standardized contracts that are traded kind of like stock, while 
forward transactions are individually customized between the parties of the 
transaction.
»
» Currency swaps: These exchanges occur when two organizations agree to 
exchange currency with each other and then exchange back at a later date, 
typically at the same rate. This allows each organization to have some foreign 
currency on hand for temporary use without foreign exchange risk. When 
available, swaps are extremely effective at mitigating risk.
»
» Options contracts: Some companies prefer to purchase options contracts, 
which give a company the option to either buy or sell a currency at a specific 
rate but doesn’t obligate them to do so.
Diversification Can’t Completely  
Eliminate Risk Exposure
Diversifying your investments means buying stock in several different companies. 
In an ideal world, if one of those companies did poorly, then the others would help 
mitigate your losses. But even this strategy can’t eliminate systematic risk (which 
comes from the fact that any given nation’s market constantly jumps around in 
different directions). For instance, if you were to buy up all the same stocks that 
are in the S&P 500 (that would be stocks from 500 different companies), then the 
value of your portfolio would increase and decrease exactly the same as the overall 
S&P 500. Even though you diversified your portfolio, you’re still vulnerable to sys-
tematic risk.
For this reason, some investors look to other nations to mitigate risk. After all, 
many times when one nation’s markets are crashing, another nation’s economy is 
booming. For example, if you owned stock in only U.S. companies at the end of 
2007, you would’ve lost quite a bit because the value of pretty much all U.S. stock 
crashed. If, on the other hand, you held stock investments in China, as well, the 
amount of your portfolio’s total value that was lost wouldn’t have been nearly as 
big because China’s equities didn’t crash in 2007 like most of the Western world.

304      PART 6  The Part of Tens
However, investing internationally has its own inherent risks not otherwise found 
in traditional equity investing. Here are just a few of them:
»
» Foreign exchange risk: Foreign equities are denominated in the currency of 
their nation, so even if the value of your equity stays the same, if the exchange 
rate drops, your investment is worth less to you.
»
» Foreign regulations: These regulations may restrict you from taking your 
money out of the country.
»
» Political instability: The government may fall apart altogether after a rebel 
coupe. (A lot of U.S. investments in Cuba were seized and lost during the 
Cuban Revolution.) Or a nation in which you have investments may have 
culturally engrained nepotism or corruption within executive management 
that results in poor competitiveness.
As with any investment or serious business venture, when you’re diversifying 
your investments internationally, you absolutely must do your research on the 
risks and maintain due diligence so that you continue to stay knowledgeable of 
any changes. But even though you can mitigate quite a bit of systematic risk by 
diversifying internationally, you take on a degree of unsystematic global risk at 
the same time. It’s a trade-off.
Cross-Listing Allows Companies to  
Tap the World’s Resources
As companies reach out in search of capital to fund startups and expansion, they 
often look beyond their own borders for investors and lenders. Why? The three 
main reasons are
»
» The domestic availability of capital is limited and can be relatively 
homogeneous.
»
» Issuing bonds abroad increases a company’s access to the number and types 
of lenders interested, reducing the amount of interest the company must pay 
to attract investors.
»
» Issuing stock abroad increases a company’s access to investors, increasing the 
amount of capital raised in stock issuances for a given expected rate of return 
for the estimated corporate risk.

CHAPTER 21  Ten Things You Need to Know about International Finance      305
In other words, companies look to international investors in order to raise more 
money at cheaper rates.
To do so, companies start by sourcing capital from their domestic markets. From 
there, they often begin sourcing capital internationally by issuing foreign bonds, 
which work a lot like regular financial bonds. With a little added sophistication, 
companies can choose to issue Eurobonds to raise their domestic currency in a 
global market.
If a company wants to issue equity internationally, often the best method of 
attracting the attention of investors is to first list equity on a foreign exchange. 
Doing so doesn’t issue new shares in the other country but allows people from 
that nation to purchase shares in secondary transactions (which can still raise 
capital for the company if it holds any treasury shares). This process of having 
shares listed in more than one equity market is called cross-listing, and it allows 
foreign investors to purchase a company’s stock in a number of ways, including 
the following:
»
» Depository receipts: These receipts are traded like equity but are represen-
tative of the equity held by another organization. They allow foreigners to 
invest without giving them direct foreign ownership.
»
» Global registered shares: These traditional shares of equity can be traded on 
multiple markets worldwide rather than a single equity market.
If a company has already cross-listed or feels that it’s large enough to attract 
investors, it can issue equity in multiple countries simultaneously during an ini-
tial public offering.
As with all international operations, sourcing capital globally comes with some 
additional risks that increase the costs of capital to some extent. For instance, 
companies often have to cover agency costs associated with staying within foreign 
financial accounting and reporting standards. Plus, foreign exchange risk often 
becomes an issue when companies deal with bonds or equity denominated in for-
eign currencies, and you can’t rule out the potential for additional risk any time 
politics (and two or more governments) are involved.
The real question is whether these risks result in costs that are greater than the 
original benefits of sourcing capital internationally. In general, when sourcing 
capital internationally, companies need to try to source capital from low-risk 
nations with great potential to provide cheap and plentiful access to investors and 
avoid listing in nations that hold little benefit but high-cost requirements or other 
forms of risk.

Outsourcing Is a Taxing Issue
The decision to outsource (or transfer certain operations to an outside company) is 
a financial one that many companies have to deal with at some point. Basically, a 
company has to decide whether another company could perform one or more of its 
operations comparably and more cheaply than it currently performs them. The 
risks associated with outsourcing translate into potential costs, but as long as the 
amount the company saves by outsourcing the operation exceeds the expected 
costs associated with risk, then outsourcing makes sense.
To decide whether outsourcing is right for your company, you can use a practice 
known as transfer pricing. In this practice, each function of the company essentially 
“purchases” and “sells” to the other functions in the company. Imagine an auto-
motive manufacturing plant, where all the functions of building a car occur in the 
same plant. One of the functions is to put tires on each car. So, the tire installation 
function of the plant purchases each car, finished up until the point of adding 
tires, from the function before it. When that function has finished installing the 
tires, it sells the car with its tires installed to the next function in the process at 
an established profit margin. The plant’s overhead costs are attributed to each 
function in the proportion that the particular function utilizes them.
Why on Earth would a company go to all the trouble of considering every single 
function of its operations as independent customers and sellers to each other? 
Because doing so allows that company to determine whether it has competitive 
pricing in each of its functions. If, through transfer pricing, the company discov-
ers that another company in a different country is capable of selling cars with tires 
on them cheaper than the company can do so, even including the cost of shipping, 
the company may decide to outsource the tire installation function. The company 
would ship the cars to the foreign company to have the tires put on, and then that 
company would ship the cars with tires back to the original company for the next 
phase of production.
Transfer pricing is pretty standard in the form of accounting called activity-based 
costing, but many companies prefer to use other accounting methods and rely on 
this form of analysis only when considering outsourcing.
Although outsourcing sounds like a win-win in the preceding example, it often 
comes with additional costs. Here are a couple of the big ones:
»
» In international finance, outsourcing any function overseas requires the 
transfer of assets over international boundaries. Sometimes outsourcing 
requires a company to either export or import some item, sometimes it 
requires a company to both export and import an item, and sometimes (as is 
the case with customer service or accounting) outsourcing just requires the 

CHAPTER 21  Ten Things You Need to Know about International Finance      307
transfer of funds to pay the other company. If the other company is providing 
goods or services to the end user, then outsourcing may also require bringing 
funds back to the parent company.
»
» Outsourcing to another country involves taxation for companies and 
governments. Companies have to pay tariffs on goods they send to another 
country, and then they have to pay more tariffs on those goods when they 
receive them back again. These costs can add up very quickly, discouraging 
outsourcing and trade.
In order to ease the burden on companies, some nations have set up trade 
agreements that allow for reduced or eliminated taxation on the transition of 
goods across national borders. Others allow tax-free capital movement under 
certain circumstances. For example, free-trade zones in China allow busi-
nesses to send goods to China, tax-free, for the purpose of altering those 
goods and then re-exporting them. So, if the car company from the preceding 
example were from the United States and sent its cars to China for tire 
installation, it would only pay taxes on those cars if the cars were sold to 
customers in China. At the same time, the U.S. car manufacturer would only 
have to pay import taxes on the value of the work done in China, not the value 
of the entire car.
Not all nations are as sensitive as China to the needs of businesses. Some nations 
even go as far as to limit or prohibit any money from leaving the country. In these 
cases, companies have to carefully manage their capital movement to make out-
sourcing work for them. Companies can choose from a number of ways to manage 
their capital movements when they choose to outsource. For instance, they can 
acquire resources from within the foreign nation and send the resources back to 
their headquarters in their own country, allowing them to allocate their foreign 
earned income as costs instead of attempting to transfer the money itself at high tax 
rates or even illegally. If these transfers occur between related companies (for exam-
ple, subsidiary and parent), then they can even alter the total amount that they’re 
taxed on their earnings by transferring assets to countries with low tax rates.
Politics Complicate Your Life
Governments and politicians seem to have an uncanny way of knowing exactly 
how to make your life as complicated as possible. When you’re dealing with inter-
national finance, you have to be aware of not only your own nation’s international 
policies but also the policies of at least one other nation, plus how each nation 
involved interacts with the others. (It’s all really quite annoying sometimes, 
except when you make your living in international finance or by writing finance 
books.)

308      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Compared to companies that operate on a purely domestic level, companies that 
operate internationally tend to be the target of more government concern as poli-
ticians attempt to cater to the needs of individual industries or adhere to some 
form of national idealism. This concern may come in any number of forms, 
including regulations or requirements placed on foreign companies and protec-
tionist policies put in place to restrict or hinder trade. Here are a few examples:
»
» Tariffs are taxes on goods being imported into a nation, which makes them 
more expensive to foreign customers. Who bears the burden of the tax will 
depend on whether any of the companies in the supply chain are willing and 
able to drop price or forfeit profitability; otherwise, the end consumer will see 
the higher prices.
»
» Quotas limit the quantity of a particular product that can be legally imported 
into a country.
»
» Embargoes outright prohibit any goods from being imported at all, usually 
from a specific nation, but can be broadly applied for specific industries. For 
example, industries such as defense, energy, telecommunications, and others 
that are critical to national infrastructure or safety, are often restricted to local 
companies or those organizations that have close ties to government officials.
These are all relatively common concerns for international companies, and each 
one limits the potential financial performance that a company can achieve within 
a nation. But some governments enforce more unusual requirements, as well:
»
» In developing nations and those nations with more restrictive government 
control, governments may require a minimum value of investment in order to 
operate within the nation. For example, a nation may require an investor or 
company to spend at least $1 million in order to start a company or purchase 
equity in a company.
»
» Government regulations may require a company to hire a minimum number 
of local nationals or maintain a minimum proportion of local nationals within 
the workforce. These regulations can impact workforce efficiency if meeting 
them requires the company to choose local nationals over those workers who 
might have more merit.
»
» Government regulations may require a company to source raw materials 
from local companies, which can also result in cost inefficiencies.
Note: Countries often make exceptions for companies that want to work in partic-
ular industries that are intended to contribute to the development of the nation or 
that will focus exclusively on hiring locals to produce exports. Plus, international 
agreements have helped pave the way for more international integration. The 

CHAPTER 21  Ten Things You Need to Know about International Finance      309
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), an agreement between the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico, has strongly reduced the limitations to trade 
between these three nations. Similarly, members of the European Union have 
severely limited economic and political restrictions between them, while Associa-
tion of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has done the same for many Southeast 
Asian nations, and Mercado Común del Sur (MERCOSUR) has done so for South 
American nations.
The world of international politics is very dynamic and not always completely 
transparent, so international companies have to keep up with relevant regulations 
and maintain a level of flexibility in all their international relations.
Cultural Understanding Is Vital
Not all financial infrastructures work the same way. Culture plays a big role in 
how a nation’s government, companies, and even individual transactions operate, 
so if you’re dealing with a company involved in international finance, you abso-
lutely must understand a bit about the nation(s) in which the company operates 
to understand the context of its overall financial position.
In many nations with a prominent Muslim presence in government, sharia law 
forbids companies from lending money and then requesting more money in return 
than what was originally issued. As a result, throughout much of the Middle East, 
companies don’t charge or earn interest in financial transactions such as in loans 
or savings accounts. In order to account for the time value of money (where 
increasing inflation causes an equal amount of money to be worth less over time), 
companies have come up with some novel solutions which resemble equity own-
ership and/or rent-to-own programs.
As a result, when financial analysts from a Western nation analyze the finances of 
a bank or other financial institution in these Muslim nations, the calculations may 
appear very different from what they’re used to seeing. This difference results 
from the lack of interest-generating loans and the way that depository accounts 
are treated more as equity than liabilities. Without an understanding of the cul-
tural and financial context in which a company operates, those analyzing the 
company are prone to making some very serious mistakes during their assessment.
Many attempts have been made worldwide to quantify cultural variations and 
develop simple, standardized methods of interpreting financial information 
across differing systems. For instance, many nations have adopted a method of 
financial accounting called the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
which was developed by the International Accounting Standards Board. The IFRS 

310      PART 6  The Part of Tens
is sort of like a common language across all nations that helps them analyze the 
same financial reports in the same way.
Even with a common reporting method, however, culture can still influence the 
context in which financial transactions take place. For example, a culture in which 
people tend to accept higher levels of risk tends to also have higher price to 
earnings ratios because the investors are willing to accept a higher price relative 
to the potential for future earnings. In contrast, a culture that tends to avoid risk 
may have a lower average price to earnings ratio. Without being aware of these 
differences, an analyst could end up either investing in an overvalued company or 
avoiding a great deal in an undervalued investment.
Companies can use the main dimensions of culture (as researched by Geert Hof-
stede) to help them identify financial trends that may seem unusual or even to 
find opportunities hidden by cultural norms unfamiliar to those outside the nation 
in question. These cultural dimensions include
»
» Risk aversion: The degree to which people generally avoid uncertainty.
»
» Power distance: The amount of social and professional equality generally 
recognized between an individual and their authority figures.
»
» Growth versus development: The degree to which the people of a nation 
generally prescribe to values in growth (for example, status, wealth, and 
power) or development (for example, quality of life and intersocial 
connections).
»
» Individualism: The degree to which a people generally view themselves as 
either individuals or as a part of a group.
»
» Context (or “time horizon”): The degree to which a people generally 
recognize things as having inherent traits or only meaning within context  
of its use (including things such as reputation).
Cryptocurrencies Come with Risk
Particularly in international transactions, cryptocurrencies have become popular 
in recent years. Countries have responded to this in a variety of ways, ranging 
from adopting cryptocurrencies as legal tender (El Salvador) to banning their use 
entirely (China). Though these currencies are touted by their fans as being supe-
rior to national currencies, cryptocurrencies behave in a very similar manner on 
the foreign exchange market.

CHAPTER 21  Ten Things You Need to Know about International Finance      311
Of those things that make cryptocurrencies unique, there are some trade-offs:
»
» Using cryptocurrencies can alleviate some of the stress and costs associated 
with foreign exchange, which is useful.
»
» The value of cryptocurrencies is extremely unstable, primarily driven by 
investment speculation, and they are subject to being hacked. This creates a 
lot of financial risk that the value of money being exchanged will dramatically 
shift between the time a contract is signed and the time payments are made.
»
» The fact that cryptocurrencies are harder to track than national currencies 
makes them a popular option for black market transactions, which still 
comprise the majority of underlying transactions using cryptocurrencies.

corporations and the people within them behave, driving an overlap between 
the fields of finance and psychology. Very broadly speaking, behavioral 
finance looks at the actions and reactions made by people in order to determine 
how to better understand them and make better decisions. Of course, each anom-
aly in behavior has developed for good reasons, but they also quite frequently put 
people in a position of lower efficiency, weaker returns, or higher risk. So, you 
need to go out of your way to study what these behaviors are and what causes 
them, measure their impact on financial performance, and seek to utilize these 
behaviors more effectively or else minimize them as much as possible.
In your pursuit to be rational in your financial decisions, whether personal or 
corporate, don’t get so caught up in doing a ton of analysis and preplanning that 
you become paralyzed and unable to make decisions. In many circumstances, you 
can end up costing a company (or yourself) more money because you wait way too

long to make decisions. In such cases, the level of detail and rationality used in 
your analysis becomes counterproductive. For example, to be a successful CFO or 
other manager of finance, you have to be able to make decisions based on partial 
information to meet time constraints. In other words, you have to maintain a bal-
ance between being as accurate as possible and taking decades to make a decision.
Making Financial Decisions Is  
Never Rational
Studies in corporate finance make the assumption that people are rational deci-
sion makers. In fact, most economic models, financial and otherwise, assume that 
people act unemotionally and with a certain degree of competence. Here’s the 
reality, though: People are emotional, illogical, impulsive, and ignorant. That’s 
where behavioral finance comes into play. It defines what’s rational, identifies the 
causes of irrational financial behavior, and measures the financial impact of irra-
tional behavior.
People rarely make any decisions, much less financial ones, entirely rationally. 
Why not? Four primary factors (other than corruption) lead people to forego 
rationality in favor of some other reasoning technique:
»
» Lack of information
»
» Lack of time to collect or process the information
»
» Lack of ability to understand the information
»
» Emotional impulse
At times when people have a limited ability to fully assess a situation, they often 
rely on reasoning methods that rely on experience-based judgments (known as 
heuristic methods) because people generally trust experience. Maybe they listen to 
their “gut,” an emotional response that you can’t precisely identify the cause of, 
or perhaps they choose to employ some loosely applicable “rule of thumb.” What-
ever alternative method they use, each one is subjective and, therefore, highly 
subject to irrationality.

CHAPTER 22  Ten Things You Need to Understand about Behavioral Finance      315
Being Irrational Can Be Entirely Rational
Understanding how irrational financial behavior works is only half the job. You 
also have to determine the value of irrationality. That is to say, you must figure 
out how much your own inherent irrationality costs you (and your company) 
financially.
To see what I mean, consider how you might measure the cost of satisficing 
behavior (see the later section “Satisficing Is Good Enough” for details):
One person goes to the store, intending to purchase ten boxes of cereal.
Store A has five boxes at $2 per box.
Store B has ten boxes at $1 per box.
The person spends $1 in fuel each direction getting to and from Store A, not 
knowing that store B has more of the cereal at a cheaper price. So, they go to the 
store twice, buying five boxes each time.
The person has spent $24 on cereal plus travel. Had they gone to Store B to see 
what it had, they would’ve spent only $10 for the cereal, $2 for fuel, plus an 
additional $1 for going between stores.
The cost of being lazy (I mean, satisficing) in this example is $11.
Satisficing isn’t the only behavior that has a measurable influence on finance. 
Although some are easier to quantify than others, all behaviors are measurable, 
but not all of them necessarily have a negative influence.
For instance, a person who was too worried about their finances to invest in an 
Internet company may have saved themselves from the crash in the late 1990s, 
giving that behavior a positive value. Does that mean it was good behavior? No, 
because it was still based on irrationality. Because the decision to refrain from 
investing was based on an emotional response rather than a calculated determi-
nation of the level of risk, the decision was just a lucky one that could have just as 
easily resulted in the person’s missing out on an important investment 
opportunity.
After identifying the role that an individual plays in the financial world and rec-
ognizing what behavioral anomalies each individual is subject to, you can make 
estimates on the cost of behavioral anomalies and take steps to mitigate the risk 
that such behaviors will occur. Formalizing and quantifying the role of human 
behavior in causing deviations from rational financial decisions is a relatively new 
but very important step to not only understanding but also improving upon the 
current financial infrastructure of organizations.

316      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Framing Affects Your Decision-Making 
Prowess
How a person processes available data is subject to behavioral errors based on the 
context in which the data are presented. For instance, when some expression of 
judgment makes its way into the presentation of data or information, that judg-
ment influences how others analyze and understand the information.
The process of introducing your own interpretation of a subjective measure or 
event is called framing. Everything you witness is processed through something of 
a filter, called a frame, which is composed of everything you’ve learned to assume 
about the world around you, including the behaviors of people. These frames will 
cause you to understand and interpret things in a different manner from the peo-
ple around you and, as a result, alter how you each respond.
Say that the marketing department manager sends you a proposal of a project and 
asks whether the project will fit within the department’s remaining budget. As 
you research the marketing budget, you discover that the entire budget has been 
drained because some marketing intern named Jeff (theoretical name has been 
changed to protect the innocent) spent it all when he purchased a jet ski for “team 
building.” You could tell the marketing manager that Jeff embezzled the funds, 
thus putting it in the manager’s mind to press criminal charges against him, or 
you could simply say that the project exceeds the remaining budget.
Both cases are likely true, but in the former you assume that Jeff was embezzling, 
putting an element of personal judgment into the scenario and essentially plant-
ing the idea in someone’s head. In the latter scenario, you’re only presenting 
information likely to be considered out of the ordinary, and Jeff may have been 
told to develop a team-building outing and made a really dumb decision. In the 
first scenario, Jeff is going to prison. In the second, the marketing department will 
likely rework the project at a lower cost until the new quarter when its budget is 
replenished and Jeff is simply fired for incompetence instead of going to prison. 
See how the way you present the information greatly influences the way the mar-
keting manager will react to it?
For another example of framing, consider the following two sentences:
The price of XYZ stock has plummeted 75 percent, causing devastating losses.
The price of XYZ stock has plummeted 75 percent, causing it to be a great buy!
In both cases, the price of XYZ stock lost 75 percent of its value, but the action that 
a person is likely to take in response to this information changes depending on 

CHAPTER 22  Ten Things You Need to Understand about Behavioral Finance      317
how the information is presented. Even so, what really matters in this situation is 
whether the company is valuable according to the analytics, not how someone 
explains what happened to the stock price.
Another form of framing is called ethnocentrism, in which you judge the occur-
rences of one nation by the standards of another. For example, when an analyst 
from a nation of people who are culturally more comfortable taking risk analyzes 
the stock of a company from a nation of people who are culturally averse to risk, 
the analyst is likely to see the company’s price to earnings as being extremely low 
for the value of the company. As a result, the analyst may think the company is 
undervalued. What’s the problem here? The analyst is judging another nation’s 
company based on the frame of their own ethnocentrism. Unless that stock cross-
lists, the price isn’t likely to increase as the analyst predicts simply because the 
people of the nation where the stock is from aren’t willing to take the additional 
risk compared to the company’s future potential earnings.
Framing can influence all sorts of financial decisions. You have to be very careful 
to apply relevant contextual information along with any analysis you give and 
ensure that the manner in which you present information remains objective, neu-
tral, and free of judgments that contribute to framing.
Making Sound Financial Decisions Involves 
Identifying Logical Fallacies
Logic can be really complicated. Common sense may get you through the day in 
one piece, but when you are dealing with finances, what you really want is good 
sense. The problem is that human brains have a tendency to try and find patterns 
in the world around them. While this pattern-seeking behavior is necessary for 
people to function (you assume that you won’t fall into oblivion with every step 
you take based on the pattern that the ground stopped you from falling before), 
sometimes it can lead people to make incorrect conclusions. When you rely on 
faulty logic, you’re relying on a fallacy.
Logical fallacies can be based on flawed logic structure, distractions, emotional 
response, or any number of other factors that use information not related to the 
decision at hand. In finance, a fallacy can lead to a huge mistake resulting from 
improper judgment. For example, you may think that a company is a bad invest-
ment because the owner is a 20-year-old college drop-out, but if every investor 
had given in to that fallacy, no one would’ve invested in a new company called 
Microsoft. Fortunately for Microsoft, their investors relied on logical decisions in 

318      PART 6  The Part of Tens
which they utilized data in a proper manner, without letting outside sources and 
unrelated information interfere.
Here are two common fallacies that you may come across in your corporate finance 
career:
»
» Gambler’s fallacy: This fallacy involves irrationally measuring the probability 
of an outcome. Pretend that you bought one share of stock and that stock is 
doing awful. Instead of selling that stock and investing in something else, you 
hold onto it because you keep thinking that it has to go up eventually, that 
statistically it can’t go down every single day. That’s faulty thinking. Even 
assuming equal probability of increase or decrease in value — that each new 
day brings a 50 percent chance that the company’s stock will increase — isn’t 
accurate because a poorly performing company has a greater probability of 
decreasing in value.
»
» Sunk cost fallacy (or “money pit”): This fallacy refers to the idea that a 
company (or individual) has already put so much money or effort into a 
project that it has to continue to pursue it at any additional cost. The fallacy is 
in value assessment and tends to be very emotionally charged. In investing, 
it’s called the disposition effect, which is when investors are more willing to 
accept gains than losses and end up holding bad stock because they think the 
price will come back up to the original purchase price eventually. To see this 
fallacy in action, imagine that you’re an entrepreneur and you start a company 
that makes car horns that sound like ducks (this was my kid’s idea). The 
company does terribly, so you continue to dump money into advertising to try 
to get sales up. Because you put so much money into the startup costs (now 
considered sunk costs because they can’t be recovered), you refuse to accept 
that investing in this company was a bad idea. Even though the original costs 
may be sunk already, continuing to put money into the bad company is just 
making things worse for you.
Getting Emotional about Financial 
Decisions Can Leave You Crying
Your financial decisions can be some of the most emotionally charged decisions 
you make in your life, which is why many people prefer to let professionals handle 
their money. They believe that professionals with no personal attachment to the 
money will be better able to make rational decisions. The world of corporate 
finance is similar in that people are typically dealing with someone else’s (the 
company’s) money, so you may think emotions run low in corporate finance. But 

CHAPTER 22  Ten Things You Need to Understand about Behavioral Finance      319
that’s not always the case. Even though they don’t realize it, people working in 
corporate finance sometimes let their emotions influence their decisions, at least 
to some extent.
Consider this real-life example: On the day that U.S. Marines captured and killed 
Osama bin Laden, stocks in the United States jumped significantly. Osama bin 
Laden’s death had absolutely nothing to do with the value of these companies, but 
their stocks jumped anyway. Why? Because the mood people are in when making 
financial decisions influences the decisions they make.
When people hear good news, they’re more prone to accepting additional risk in 
their investments. When people receive bad news, they tend to be more wary and 
avoid risk as much as possible (assuming they’re not prone to extreme acts of 
self-destructive behavior that would lead them to do something crazy).
No matter how far removed you are from the person who owns the money you’re 
working with, when you’re forced to make a decision, your mood and emotions 
will influence the decision you make to some extent. Although this won’t change 
your entire financial strategy (only those with extreme emotional volatility will 
allow an emotional state to dictate their major decisions), when your mood influ-
ences your willingness to deviate from rationality, financial inefficiencies will 
occur, resulting in either increased costs or decreased income. In a single incident, 
this deviation from rationality may not be entirely damaging, but as more and 
more people in a company are influenced in this way or a single person is continu-
ously influenced, over time the company can face significant decreases in total 
financial effectiveness.
Financial Stampeding Can  
Get You Trampled
Investors have a tendency to get caught up in a stampede of other investors, 
believing that they’re running like the bulls on Wall Street when, in reality, they 
were just lemmings jumping off a cliff. As soon as some trend begins to occur, 
investors start to follow that trend as quickly as possible, often without even fully 
knowing why. All they know is that they don’t want to miss out on something big.
Like some other forms of behavioral anomalies, this stampeding scenario is influ-
enced by the imperfect distribution of information. In other words, not everyone 
receives all the same information at the same time. So, when someone sees an 
individual or group, particularly one that has developed some form of credibility 
in the person’s mind, participating confidently in some transaction that seems 

320      PART 6  The Part of Tens
unusual, that person is likely to wonder if that individual or group knows some-
thing he doesn’t. The person may even know that an investment isn’t worth what 
people are paying for it, and yet they will happily pay the same price because the 
investment has already increased in value so much that they start to question 
their original opinion.
All you need to create this stampeding scenario are
»
» Someone who is deciding whether the return on some purchase or invest-
ment is worth the cost plus risk
»
» At least one other person who has decided that the return is worth the risk 
(leading the first person to question their judgment)
When these two things are in place, you have a behavioral time bomb of poor 
financial judgment. This sort of situation is what often leads to bank insolvency, 
where depositors withdraw all their money after losing confidence in the banks 
(this hurt a lot of banks during the Great Depression). It also leads to investment 
bubbles, where a category of investments is highly overvalued because people 
overestimate how far above book value per share a company can sustain stock 
price using earnings, driven by other investor’s confidence in a type of stock. This 
happened extremely frequently during the dot com bubble, where many investors 
lost lots of money when Internet companies crashed.
Letting Relationships Influence Finances 
Can Be Ruinous
The idea that whom you know is more important than what you know holds 
weight all over the world. In Chinese, it’s called guanxi, in Arabic, it’s called wasta, 
in Russian, it’s called blat, but it all means the same thing: showing favoritism 
based on personal relationships rather than merit or qualifications. In the English 
language, this form of favoritism is called cronyism (or nepotism, when you’re 
dealing with relatives). Basically, it works like this: You are in charge of some-
thing at your company, and you make decisions to spend money on goods and 
services based on the personal relationships you have with people rather than 
their merit compared to those competing with them. Maybe you are in charge of 
hiring or you know someone who is, and you push for a particular person to get 
hired based on the fact that you know this person, and you want to maintain good 
relations with them, or you think working with them would be fun. As a result, 
wages may be paid to an employee who has lower productivity and less potential 
to contribute to the company in the long run compared to other candidates. 

CHAPTER 22  Ten Things You Need to Understand about Behavioral Finance      321
Or maybe you’re in charge of procurement and you purchase supplies from the 
company where one of your family members works because you trust them over 
someone you don’t know. In this case, you may end up paying more for the com-
pany’s supplies either by simply accepting the higher price or by not performing 
a full evaluation of market prices and quality.
Cronyism isn’t the same as networking. Although you are attempting to do busi-
ness with people you know in both cases, in networking, you are attempting to use 
social opportunities to find people who can benefit your business. In cronyism, 
you are looking to use professional opportunities to benefit your social 
connections.
Preventing cronyism from occurring in a company is relatively simple at all levels 
of management. You just have to require individuals to use predetermined evalu-
ation criteria when making important decisions and then hold them accountable 
for proper recording and analysis using that criteria. Doing so helps a company 
maintain a business network based on quality, price, and other forms of merit 
rather than personal relationships, thus improving financial performance at all 
levels and across all departments.
Satisficing Is Good Enough
Remember that old saying “time is money”? Well, come to find out that people 
naturally apply a value to their time. This value isn’t so much about money as it is 
about using your limited amount of time doing things you either need to do or 
would rather be doing. For a simple example, imagine that you’re spending your 
day off playing video games, and you just can’t take time away to go cook dinner. 
So, you decide to order a pizza. You could probably make something healthier, 
cheaper, and more delicious, but you settle for something that’s good enough and 
doesn’t require any additional time or effort on your part.
In corporate finance, the application and measurement of what’s “good enough” 
is called satisficing.
Satisficing, in a more practical sense, refers more to our inability to know what is 
truly rational. Say that you own a dog-wash. When you’re shopping for flea pow-
der for your customers’ dogs, you probably don’t know what price every store in 
the city charges, so you just go to whatever store you’ve been to before, believe to 
have prices reasonably below retail, or with whom you have a working rapport. 
Even if that store doesn’t have enough flea powder, most likely you’ll end up buy-
ing whatever they have available with the mindset that you can always go back out 
when you run out. The store down the street has plenty and it’s actually $1 cheaper 

322      PART 6  The Part of Tens
per box, but you don’t know that, and you don’t intend to run around the entire 
city. Why? It’s because the measure of time it would take to fully collect all the 
information and resources required to make a rational decision aren’t available. In 
the time it took you to go back out and pick up more flea powder, you would’ve 
been better off going to the other store, but being unaware that the other store 
even had flea powder you determined that this was good enough for your immedi-
ate needs.
This could be applied to an employee who doesn’t have anything else to do, so 
financially their time is theoretically worthless. This person places a certain value 
on their time that they would rather be doing something other than figuring out 
what the flea powder market looks like.
Note that in both examples, satisficing behavior is causing people to make  
less-than-optimal decisions, but they did so based on the decision that their time 
was worth more than the potential benefits. As with all financial decisions, satis-
ficing comes with a degree of uncertainty and risk, so the results can be good 
or bad.
Prospect Theory Explains the Improbable
People prefer to live their lives in a fantasy. They fear what they don’t understand 
and dream of what they (probably) can’t attain. You shouldn’t be surprised, then, 
to find out that this same view influences people’s financial decisions in a behav-
ioral fluke described as the prospect theory, which basically says this:
When making financial decisions that aren’t certain (meaning that the outcomes 
aren’t certain, but the probability of success can be estimated), people look at the 
potential for gain or loss instead of relying on rational thinking using the probable 
outcomes.
Consider health insurance as an example of this theory in action. Insurance com-
panies have so much data available to them that they can determine with extreme 
accuracy what the probability is that you’ll get sick or hurt based on your ancestry, 
geographic location, job, lifestyle habits, and a number of other variables that they 
research about you when you apply for coverage. As a result, insurance companies 
can also accurately estimate the amount they’ll have to pay every year in health 
benefits. They then charge a percentage over that amount to maintain profits. (In 
other words, you pay more for medical services every year than they’re worth in 
the amount equal to the overhead costs and profits of the entire health insurance 
industry.)

CHAPTER 22  Ten Things You Need to Understand about Behavioral Finance      323
Why on Earth do people pay so much for health insurance when they would likely 
be better off just paying the hospital directly? Because people make decisions in 
the world of the improbable, thanks to the prospect theory. Insurance salesmen 
are trained to prey on this fact. They tell you horror stories about what could hap-
pen to you and your family if you don’t have coverage. Although there’s a small 
probability that you will, in fact, receive more benefits from your coverage than 
you actually pay, that probability is very small, as proven by the fact that insur-
ance companies increase in profitability nearly every year. Still, people focus on 
that small probability of the worst-case scenario, and then they act on it.
The prospect theory has two extremes:
»
» At one extreme, you have the people who fear potential loss significantly 
more than they desire potential gain. These people have a difficult time 
investing at all for the fear that they may lose the money. These people 
purchase the maximum amount of every insurance they can buy and are 
definitely not investing in the stock market.
»
» At the other end, you have the people who desire the potential gains far more 
than they fear the potential losses. These people take extreme risks in the 
hopes of earning a huge financial return. They’re often day traders, bank 
executives, or hopeless gambling addicts.
The people who make the most rational decisions attempt to objectively measure 
the potential gains and losses, weighted by probability. Many of them end up 
working as value investors or finance writers.
Being Biased Is Human Nature
When you’re dealing with corporate finance, you rely on the collection and analy-
sis of data to help you answer questions and make decisions. Even though all the 
data you need to make the best decision may be available, how you actually per-
ceive and use that data can be an erroneous process thanks to the following two 
types of bias:
»
» Statistical bias: This type of bias occurs when people collect data from a 
sample rather than an entire data set and then assume that the data they 
collected represent the entire data set. Say that a financial analyst wants to 
assess the returns on capital investment that a company is able to generate. If 
they take their data only from the marketing department of the company 
rather than from every department, their analysis is going to be biased.

324      PART 6  The Part of Tens
»
» Cognitive bias: This bias occurs during the processing of information as 
people choose to use their own personal judgment rather than the data 
results. Cognitive biases come in a variety of shapes and sizes:
•	 Status quo bias refers to peoples’ tendencies to avoid changing established 
methods, such as when a team of employees refuses to implement a more 
efficient inventory management system just because they don’t want to 
learn the new system.
•	 Self-serving bias refers to people’s tendency to give themselves credit for 
successes but blame outside factors for failure. This type of bias contrib-
utes to erroneous self-assessments of investing performance.
•	 Confirmation bias refers to the tendency of people to acknowledge only 
data that confirm their preconceived beliefs, resulting in the rejection of 
any truths that challenge their beliefs. This type of bias can devastate a 
company when it leads management to ignore its analysts.
Corporate finance relies heavily on accuracy of data and the precision of analysis. 
Although individuals are constantly subject to multiple types of biases, companies 
can reduce the rate of error due to bias by maintaining proper data collection 
methods and utilizing full analyses. The key is to interpret only what has actually 
occurred instead of letting personal judgment influence decisions.
