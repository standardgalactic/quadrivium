Animal 
Consciousness: 
What Matters 
and Why 
/ 
BY DANIEL C. DENNETT 
/jlRE animals conscious? The way we are? Which species, and 
why? What is it like to be a bat, a rat, a vulture, a whale? 
But perhaps we really do not want to know the answers to 
these questions. We should not despise the desire to be kept in 
ignorance 
-are there not many facts about yourself 
and your 
loved ones that you would wisely choose not to know? 
Speaking for myself, 
I am sure that I would go to some lengths 
to prevent myself 
from learning all the secrets of those around 
me- whom they found disgusting, 
whom they secretly 
adored, 
what crimes and follies they had committed, 
or thought I had 
committed! Learning all these facts would destroy my 
composure, cripple my attitude towards those around me. 
Perhaps learning too much about our animal cousins would 
have a similarly 
poisonous effect on our relations with them. 
But if so, then let us make a frank declaration to that effect 
and drop the topic, instead of pursuing any further the 
pathetic course upon which many are now embarked. 
For current thinking 
about animal consciousness 
is a mess. 
Hidden and not so hidden agendas distort discussion and 
impede research. A kind of comic relief can be found- if you 
go in for bitter 
irony- by turning 
to the "history 
of the history" 
of the controversies. 
I am not known for my spirited defenses 
of Ren√© Descartes, but I find I have to sympathize 
with an 
honest scientist 
who was apparently 
the first victim of the wild

misrepresentations 
of the lunatic fringe of the animal rights 
movement. Animal rights activists 
such as Peter Singer and 
Mary Midgley have recently helped spread the myth that 
Descartes was a callous vivisector, 
completely indifferent 
to 
animal suffering 
because 
o/his view that animals (unlike people) 
were mere automata. As Justin Leiber (1988) has pointed out, 
in an astringent 
re-examination 
of the supposed evidence for 
this, "There is simply not a line in Descartes to suggest that he 
thought we are free to smash animals at will or free to do so 
because their behavior can be explained mechanically." 
More- 
over, the favorite 
authority 
of Descartes's accusors, Montaigne, 
on whom both Singer and Midgley also uncritically 
rely, was a 
gullible romantic 
of breathtaking 
ignorance, eager to take the 
most fanciful 
folktales 
of animal mentality 
at face value, and 
not at all interested 
m finding 
out, as Descartes himself 
was, how 
animals actually work! 
Much the same attitude 
is common today. There is a curious 
tolerance of patent inconsistency 
and obscurantism 
and a 
bizarre one-sidedness 
in the treatment 
of evidence regarding 
animal minds. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas writes a book, The 
Hidden Life of Dogs (1993), which mixes acute observation 
and 
imaginative 
hypothesis-formulation 
with sheer fantasy, 
and in 
the generally favorable welcome the book receives, few if any 
point out that it is irresponsible, 
that she has polluted her 
potentially 
valuable evidence with well-meant 
romantic decla- 
rations that she could not have any defensible grounds for 
believing. If you want to believe 
in the consciousness 
of dogs, 
her poetry is just the ticket. If you want to know about the 
consciousness 
of dogs, you have to admit that although she 
raises many good questions, her answers are not to be trusted. 
That is not to say that she is wrong in all her claims, but that 
they just will not do as answers to the questions, not if we really 
want to know the answers. 
A forlorn hope, some say. Certain questions, it is said, are 
quite beyond science at this point (and perhaps forever). The 
cloaks of mystery 
fall conveniently 
over the very issues that

promise (or threaten) to shed light on the grounds for our 
moral attitudes toward different 
animals. Again, a curious 
asymmetry 
can be observed. We do not require absolute, 
Cartesian certainty 
that our fellow human beings are con- 
scious-what we require is what is aptly called moral certainty. 
Can we not have the same moral certainty about the 
experiences of animals? I have not yet seen an argument by a 
philosopher to the effect that we cannot, with the aid of 
science, establish facts about animal minds with the same 
degree of moral certainty 
that satisfies us in the case of our 
own species. So whether or not a case has been made for the 
"in principle" mystery 
of consciousness (I myself am utterly 
unpersuaded by the arguments offered to date), it is a red 
herring. We can learn enough about animal consciousness 
to 
settle the questions we have about our responsibilities. 
The 
moral agenda about animals is important, 
and for that very 
reason it must not be permitted to continue to deflect the 
research, both empirical and conceptual, on which an 
informed 
ethics could be based. 
A striking 
example of one-sided use of evidence is Thomas 
Nagel's famous paper "What is it Like to be a Bat?" (1991). 
One of the rhetorical 
peculiarities 
of Nagel's paper is that he 
chose bats and went to the trouble to relate a few of the 
fascinating 
facts about bats and their echolocation, because, 
presumably, 
those hard-won, third-person-perspective 
scien- 
tific facts tell us something 
about bat consciousness. 
What? First 
and least, they support our conviction 
that bats are conscious. 
(He did not write a paper called "What is it Like to be a 
Brick?") Second, and more important, they support his 
contention that bat consciousness is very unlike ours. The 
rhetorical peculiarity- 
if not outright inconsistency- 
of his 
treatment 
of the issue can be captured by an obvious question: 
if a few such facts can establish something 
about bat 
consciousness, 
would more such facts not establish more? He 
has already relied on "objective, third-person" scientific 
investigation 
to establish (or at least render rationally 
credible)

the hypothesis 
that bats are conscious, but not in just the way 
we are. Why wouldn't further 
such facts be able to tell us in 
exactly what ways bats' consciousness isn't like ours, thereby 
telling us what it is like to be a bat? What kind of fact is it that 
only works for one side of an empirical question? 
The fact is that we all do rely, without hesitation, on 
"third-person" behavioral evidence to support or reject 
hypotheses about the consciousness of animals. What else, 
after all, could be the source of our "pretheoretical 
intuitions"? 
But these intuitions 
in themselves 
are an untrustworthy 
lot, 
much in need of reflective 
evaluation. For instance, 
do you see 
"sentience" or "mere discriminatory 
reactivity" 
in the Venus 
Fly Trap, or in the amoeba, or in the jellyfish? 
What more than 
mere discriminatory 
reactivity- 
the sort of competence many 
robots exhibit- are you seeing when you see sentience in a 
creature? It is, in fact, ridiculously 
easy to induce powerful 
intuitions 
of not just sentience but full-blown 
consciousness 
(ripe with malevolence or curiosity 
or friendship) 
by exposing 
people to quite simple robots made to move in familiar mammalian 
ways at mammalian 
speeds. 
Cog, a delightfully 
humanoid robot being built at MIT, has 
eyes, hands, and arms that move the way yours do- swiftly, 
re- 
laxedly, compliantly 
(Dennett, 1994). Even those of us working 
on the project, knowing 
full well that we have not even begun 
to 
program the high level processes that might arguably endow 
Cog with consciousness, 
get an almost overwhelming 
sense of 
being in the presence of another conscious observer 
when Cog's 
eyes still quite blindly and stupidly 
follow one's hand gestures. 
Once again, I plead for symmetry: 
when you acknowledge 
the 
power of such elegant, lifelike motions to charm you into an 
illusion, 
note that it ought to be an open question, still, whether 
you are also being charmed by your beloved dog or cat or the 
noble elephant. Feelings are too easy to provoke for them to 
count for much here. 
If behavior, casually observed by the gullible or generous- 
hearted, is a treacherous benchmark, might composition-

material and structure- provide some important leverage? 
History offers a useful perspective 
on this question. It was not 
so long ago- Descartes's day- when the hypothesis that a 
material 
brain by itself 
could sustain consciousness 
was deemed 
preposterous. Only immaterial souls could conceivably 
be 
conscious. What was inconceivable 
then is readily conceivable 
now. Today, we can readily conceive that a brain, without 
benefit of immaterial 
accompanists, 
can be a sufficient 
seat of 
consciousness, 
even if we wonder just how this could be. This is 
surely a possibility 
in almost everybody's 
eyes, and many of us 
think the evidence for its truth mounts close to certainty. 
For 
instance, few if any today would think that the "discovery" 
that, say, lefthanders 
don't have immaterial minds but just 
brains would show unmistakably 
that they are just zombies. 
Unimpressed 
by this retreat, 
some people today baulk at the 
very idea of silicon consciousness or artif 
actual consciousness, 
but the reasons offered for these general claims are 
unimpressive 
to say the least. It looks more and more as if we 
will simply have to look at what entities- animals in this case, 
but also robots and other things made of nonstandard 
materials- actually 
can do, and use that as our best guide to 
whether animals are conscious and, if so, why and of what. 
I once watched with fascination 
and, I must admit, disgust 
while hundreds of vultures feasted on a rotting elephant 
carcass in the hot sun of a June day in Kenya. I found the 
stench so overpowering 
that I had to hold my nose and breath 
through a kerchief 
to keep from gagging, all the time keeping 
my distance, but there were the vultures eagerly shouldering 
each other aside and clambering inside the carcass for the 
tastiest morsels. (I will spare you the most mind-boggling 
details.) Now I am quite confident, 
and I expect you agree with 
me, that I was thereby given very good evidence that those 
vultures do not share my olfactory 
quality space. In fact, as I 
have subsequently 
learned, these Old World vultures, unlike 
their rather distant New World cousins, do not rely on 
olfaction at all; they use their keen eyesight to spot carrion.

The peculiar nauseating odors of rotting carrion, carried by 
such well-named amines as cadaverine and putrescine, 
are 
attractants 
to the New World turkey vultures (Cathartes 
aura), 
however, and the presumed explanation is that in the New 
World these birds evolved in an ecology in which they hunted 
for food hidden under a canopy of trees, which diminished 
the 
utility 
of vision and heightened the utility 
of olfaction. David 
Houston (1986) has conducted experiments 
using fresh, ripe, 
and very-ripe chicken carcasses, hidden from sight in the 
forests of a Panamanian island, to titrate the olfactory 
talents 
of turkey vultures. So we're making progress; we now 
know- to a moral certainty- 
something 
about the difference 
between what it is like to be an African vulture and what it is 
like to be a Central American turkey 
vulture. 
So let's go on. What does a rotting 
chicken carcass smell like 
to a turkey 
vulture? 
At first 
blush it may seem obvious that we 
can confidently 
set aside the philosophers' problem of other 
minds in this instance and assume, uncontroversially, 
that 
these vultures rather go in for the smell of carrion. Or does 
anybody suppose that vultures might be heroic martyrs 
of the 
scavenger world, bravely fighting 
back their nausea while they 
perform 
their appointed duties? 
Here, it seems, we correct one extrapolation 
from our own 
case by another: we dismiss our imputation 
to them of our own 
revulsion by noting their apparent eagerness- 
as revealed by 
their behavior. When we exhibit such eagerness, it is because 
we like something, 
so they must like what they are doing and 
feeling. Similarly, 
we do not worry 
about the poor seal pups on 
their ice floe, chilling their little flippers. We would be in 
agony, lying naked on the ice with the wind blowing over us, 
but they are designed for the cold. They are not shivering 
or 
whimpering, 
and indeed they exhibit the demeanor of beasts 
who could not be more content with their current circum- 
stances-home sweet home. 
"But wait!" says the philosopher. "You are being awfully 
sloppy in these everyday attributions.

possible 
in principle. 
Vulture revulsion is possible in principle, 
is 
it not? You would not make their observed behavior criterial 
of 
pleasure, would you? Are you some benighted behaviorist? 
The 
suggestion 
that it makes no sense for vultures to be disgusted 
by their designated diet is nothing but Panglossian optimism. 
Perhaps vultures 
have been misdesigned 
by evolution; perhaps 
vulture ancestors found themselves 
in a sort of evolutionary 
cul-de-sac, 
hating the taste and smell of the only food available 
in their niche, but having no choice but to overcome their 
distaste and gag it down; perhaps they have since developed a 
sort of stoic demeanor, and what you have interpreted 
as gusto 
is actually desperation!" 
Fair enough, I reply. My rush to judgment was perhaps a bit 
rash, so let's explore further to see whether any supporting 
evidence can be found for your alternative 
hypothesis. 
Here is 
a relevant fact: turkey vultures are attracted by the smell of 
one-day-old or two-day-old 
carcasses, but they ignore older, 
still more pungent fare. It is conjectured 
that the toxin level in 
such flyblown 
remains eventually is too great even for the 
toxin-tolerant 
vultures, who leave them for the maggots. 
Insects, it is believed, use the onset of these later products of 
decomposition as their cue that a carcass is sufficiently 
decomposed to be a suitable site for egg-laying 
and, hence, 
maggot formation. 
This still leaves unanswered the residual 
question of whether turkey vultures actually like the smell of 
middle-aged carrion. At this point, my knowledge of actual or 
contemplated vulture research gives out, so I will have to 
consider some invented possibilities, 
for the time being. It 
would be fascinating 
to discover something 
along the lines of 
an incompletely 
suppressed gag-reflex 
as part of the normal 
vulture feeding behavior, or perhaps some traces of approach- 
avoidance opponent systems tugging away at each other in 
their brains, a sort of activity not to be found, we might 
imagine, in the brains of birds with more savory diets. Such 
discoveries 
would indeed add real support to your surprising 
hypothesis, 
but, of course, they would be just more "behav-

ioral" or "functional" 
evidence. Once again, a superficially 
plausible but retrospectively 
naive or oversimple 
interpretation 
would be overthrown 
by more sophisticated 
use of behavioral 
considerations. 
And you can hardly accept the support of this 
imagined evidence without agreeing that not discovering it 
would count against your alternative 
and in favor of my initial 
interpretation. 
This might be- indeed ought to be- just the beginning 
of a 
long and intricate examination of the possible functional 
interpretations 
of events in the vultures' nervous systems, 
but 
let us cut to the chase, for I imagine our dissenting 
philosopher 
to insist in the end, after one or another hypothesis 
regarding 
complexities 
of vulture reactivity 
to carrion had been effectively 
confirmed, 
that still no amount of such merely third-personal 
investigation 
could ever ("in principle") tell us what carrion 
actually 
smelled 
like to a vulture. This would be asserted not on 
the basis of any further 
argument, 
mind you, but just because 
eventually 
this is the "intuitive" 
card that is standardly 
played. 
What I find insupportable in this familiar impasse is the 
coupling of blithe assertion of consciousness 
with the equally 
untroubled lack of curiosity 
about what this assertion might 
amount to, and how it might be investigated. 
Leiber (1988) 
provides a handy scorecard: 
Montaigne 
is ecumenical 
in this respect, 
claiming 
consciousness 
for spiders 
and ants, and even writing 
of our duties to trees and 
plants. Singer and Clarke agree in denying 
consciousness 
to 
sponges. 
Singer locates the distinction 
somewhere 
between 
the 
shrimp 
and the oyster. 
He, with 
rather 
considerable 
convenience 
for one who is thundering 
hard accusations 
at others, 
slides by 
the case of insects and spiders and bacteria; they, pace 
Montaigne, 
apparently 
and rather 
conveniently 
do not feel pain. 
The intrepid 
Midgiey, 
on the other hand, seems willing to 
speculate 
about the subjective 
experience 
of tapeworms 
. . . 
Nagel . . . appears to draw the line at flounders 
and wasps, 
though 
more recently 
he speaks of the inner life of cockroaches. 
The list could be extended. In a recent paper, Michael 
Lockwood (1993) supposes, as so many do, that Nagel's "what

699 
it is like to be" formula fixes a sense of consciousness. 
He then 
says: "Consciousness 
in this sense is presumably 
to be found in 
all mammals, and probably in all birds, reptiles and amphibi- 
ans as well." It is the "presumably" 
and "probably" to which I 
want us to attend. Lockwood gives no hint as to how he would 
set out to replace these terms with something 
more definite. I 
am not asking for certainty. Birds aren't just probably 
warm-blooded, and amphibians aren't just presumably 
air- 
breathing. Nagel confessed at the outset not to know- or to 
have any recipe for discovering- where to draw the line as we 
descend the scale of complexity 
(or is it the cuddliness scale?). 
This embarrassment 
is standardly 
waved aside by those who 
find it just obvious that there is something 
it is like to be a bat 
or a dog, equally obvious that there is not something 
it is like to 
be a brick, and unhelpful 
at this time 
to dispute whether 
it is like 
anything 
to be a fish or a spider. What does it mean to say that 
it is or it isn't? 
It has passed for good philosophical 
form to invoke mutual 
agreement here that we know what we're talking about even if 
we can't explain it yet. I want to challenge this. I claim that this 
standard methodological assumption has no clear pre- 
theoretical meaning- in spite of its undeniable "intuitive" 
appeal- and that since this is so, it is ideally suited to play the 
deadly role of the "shared" intuition 
that conceals the solution 
from us. Maybe there really is a huge difference 
between us 
and all other species in this regard; maybe 
we should consider 
"radical" hypotheses. 
Lockwood says "probably" all birds are 
conscious, but maybe 
some of them- or even all of them- are 
rather like sleepwalkers! Or what about the idea that there 
could be unconscious pains (and that animal pain, though real, 
and- yes- morally important, 
was unconscious pain)? Maybe 
there is a certain amount of generous-minded 
delusion (which 
I once called the Beatrix Potter syndrome) 
in our bland mutual 
assurance that as Lockwood puts it, "Pace Descartes, conscious- 
ness, thus construed, isn't remotely, on this planet, the 
monopoly of human beings."

How, though, could we ever explore these "maybes"? We 
could do so in a constructive, 
anchored way by first devising a 
theory that concentrated 
exclusively 
on human 
consciousness 
- 
the one variety about which we will brook no "maybes" or 
"probablys"- and then look and see which features of that 
account apply to which animals, and why. There is plenty of 
work to do, which I will illustrate 
with a few examples- just 
warm-up exercises for the tasks to come. 
In Moby Dick, Herman Melville asks some wonderful 
questions about what it is like to be a sperm whale. The whale's 
eyes are located on opposite sides of a huge bulk: "the front of 
the Sperm Whale's head," Melville memorably 
tells us, "is a 
dead, blind wall, without 
a single organ or tender prominence 
of any sort whatever" 
(Ch. 76). As Melville notes: "The whale, 
therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and 
another distinct 
picture on that side; while all between must be 
profound darkness and nothingness 
to him" (Ch. 74). 
Nevertheless, 
any one's experience will teach him, that though 
he can take in an indiscriminating 
sweep of things at one glance, 
it is quite impossible for him, attentively, 
and completely, 
to 
examine any two things- however large or however small- at 
one and the same instant 
of time; never mind if they lie side by 
side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate 
these two objects, and surround each by a circle of profound 
darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a manner as 
to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly 
excluded from your contemporary 
consciousness. How is it, 
then, with the whale? ... 
is his brain so much more 
comprehensive, 
combining, 
and subtle than man's, that he can at 
the same moment of time attentively 
examine two distinct 
prospects, 
one on one side of him, and the other in an exactly 
opposite direction? 
Melville goes on to suggest that the "extraordinary 
vacilla- 
tions of movement" 
exhibited by sperm whales when they are 
"beset by three or four boats" may proceed "from the helpless 
perplexity 
of volition, 
in which their divided and diametrically 
opposite powers of vision must involve them" (Ch 74).

Might these "extraordinary vacillations" rather be the 
whale's attempt to keep visual track of the wheeling boats? 
Many birds, who also "suffer" from eyes on opposite sides of 
their heads, achieve a measure of "binocular" depth percep- 
tion by bobbing their heads back and forth, 
giving their brains 
two slightly 
different 
views, and permitting 
the relative motion 
of parallax to give them approximately the same depth 
information 
we get all at once from our two eyes with their 
overlapping fields. 
Melville assumes that whatever it is like to be a whale, it is 
similar to human consciousness 
in one regard: there is a single 
boss in charge, an "I" or "ego" that either superhumanly 
distributes 
its gaze over disparate scenarios, or humanly flicks 
back and forth between two rivals. But might there be even 
more radical discoveries in store? Whales are not the only 
animals whose eyes have visual fields with little or no overlap; 
rabbits are another. In rabbits there is no interocular 
transfer 
of learning! That is, if you train a rabbit that a particular 
shape 
is a source of danger by demonstrations 
carefully 
restricted 
to 
its left eye, the rabbit will exhibit no "knowledge" about that 
shape, no fear or flight 
behavior, when the menacing shape is 
presented to its right 
eye. When we ask what it is like to be that 
rabbit, it appears that at the very least we must put a subscript, 
dexter or sinister, 
on our question in order to make it 
well-formed. 
Now let's leap the huge chasm that separates our cousins, 
the whale and the rabbit, from a much more distant relative, 
the snake. In an elegant paper, "Cued and detached 
representations in animal cognition," Peter G√§rdenfors 
(unpublished) points out "why a snake can't think of a 
mouse." 
It seems that a snake does not have a central representation 
of a 
mouse but relies solely on transduced information. 
The snake 
exploits three different 
sensory 
systems 
in relation to prey, like a 
mouse. To strike the mouse, the snake uses its visual system 
(or 
thermal 
sensors). When struck, 
the mouse normally 
does not die

immediately, 
but runs away for some distance. 
To locate the 
mouse, 
once the prey has been struck, 
the snake uses its sense of 
smell. 
The search behavior 
is exclusively 
wired to this modality. 
Even if the mouse happens 
to die right 
in front 
of the eyes of the 
snake, it will still follow 
the smell trace of the mouse in order to 
find it. This unimodality 
is 
particularly 
evident 
in snakes like boas and pythons, 
where 
the prey often is held fast in the coils of the snake's body, 
when it e.g. hangs from a branch. Despite the fact that the 
snake must 
have ample proprioceptory 
information 
about the 
location 
of the prey it holds, 
it searches 
stochastically 
for it, all 
around, only with the help of the olfactory 
sense organs 
(Sj√∂lander, 
1993, p. 3). 
Finally, 
after 
the mouse has been located, 
the snake must find 
its head in order to swallow 
it. This could obviously 
be done with 
the aid of smell or sight, 
but in snakes this process uses only 
tactile 
information. 
Thus the snake uses three separate 
modali- 
ties to catch and eat a mouse. 
Can we talk about what the snake itself 
"has access" to, or just 
about what its various parts have access to? Is any of that 
obviously sufficient 
for consciousness? 
The underlying pre- 
sumption that Nagel's "what is it like" question makes sense at 
all, when applied to a snake, is challenged by such possibilities. 
I have argued at length, in Consciousness 
Explained (1991), 
that the sort of informational 
unification that is the most 
important prerequisite for our kind of consciousness is not 
anything we are born with, not part of our innate "hard- 
wiring," 
but in surprisingly 
large measure an artifact 
of our 
immersion in human culture. What that early education 
produces in us is a sort of benign "user-illusion"- 
-I call it the 
Cartesian Theater: the illusion that there is a place in our 
brains where the show goes on, towards which all perceptual 
"input" streams, 
and whence flow all "conscious intentions" 
to 
act and speak. I claim that other species- and human beings 
when they are newborn- simply are not beset 
by the illusion of 
the Cartesian Theater. Until the organization 
is formed, there 
is simply no user in there to be fooled. This is undoubtedly 
a 
radical suggestion, 
hard for many thinkers 
to take seriously, 
hard for them even to entertain. 
Let me repeat it, since many

crides have ignored the possibility 
that I mean it- -a misfiring 
of their generous allegiance to the principle of charity. 
In order to be conscious- in order to be the sort of thing it is 
like something 
to be- it is necessary to have a certain sort of 
informational 
organization 
that endows that thing with a wide 
set of cognitive powers (such as the powers of reflection 
and 
re-representation). 
This sort of internal organization 
does not 
come automatically 
with so-called "sentience." It is not the 
birthright 
of mammals or warm-blooded 
creatures or verte- 
brates; it is not even the birthright 
of human beings. It is an 
organization 
that is swiftly 
achieved in one species, ours, and in 
no other. Other species no doubt achieve somewhat 
similar 
organizations, 
but the differences 
are so great that most of the 
speculative translations 
of imagination 
from our case to theirs 
make no sense. 
My claim is not that other species lack our kind of 
¬ø¬ø//-consciousness, 
as Nagel (1991) and others have supposed. I 
am claiming that what must be added to mere responsivity, 
mere discrimination, 
to count as consciousness at all is an 
organization 
that is not ubiquitous among sentient organisms. 
This idea has been dismissed out of hand by most thinkers.1 
Nagel, for instance, finds it to be a "bizarre claim" that 
"implausibly 
implies that babies can't have conscious sensa- 
tions before they learn to form judgments about themselves." 
Lockwood is equally emphatic: "Forget culture, forget lan- 
guage. The mystery 
begins with the lowliest organism which, 
when you stick a pin in it, say, doesn't merely react, but actually 
feels something." 
Indeed, that is where the mystery 
begins if you insist on 
starting there, 
with the assumption that you know what you 
mean by the contrast between merely reacting and actually 
feeling. And the mystery 
will never stop, apparently, 
if that is 
where you start. 
In an insightful 
essay on bats (and whether 
it is like anything 
to be a bat), Kathleen Akins (1993) pursues the sort of detailed 
investigation 
into functional 
neuroscience 
that Nagel eschews,

SOCIAL RESEARCH 
and she shows that Nagel is at best ill-advised in simply 
assuming that a bat must have a point of view. Akins sketches a 
few of the many different stories that can be told from the 
vantage point of the various subsystems that go to making up a 
bat's nervous system. It is tempting, on learning these details, 
to ask ourselves "and where in the brain does the bat itself 
reside," but this is an even more dubious question in the case 
of the bat than it is in our own case. There are many parallel 
stories that could be told about what goes on in you and me. 
What gives one of those stories about us pride of place at any 
one time is just this: it is the story you or I will tell if asked (to 
put a complicated matter crudely). 
When we consider a creature that isn't a teller- has no 
language- what happens to the supposition that one of its 
stories is privileged? The hypothesis that there is one such 
story that would tell us (if we could understand it) what it is 
actually like to be that creature dangles with no evident 
foundation or source of motivation- except dubious tradition. 
Bats, like us, have plenty of relatively peripheral neural 
machinery devoted to "low level processing" of the sorts that 
are routinely supposed to be entirely unconscious in us. And 
bats have no machinery analogous to our machinery for 
issuing public protocols regarding their current subjective 
circumstances, of course. Do they then have some other "high 
level" or "central" system that plays a privileged role? Perhaps 
they do and perhaps they don't. Perhaps there is no role for 
such a level to play, no room for any system to perform the 
dimly imagined task of elevating merely unconscious neural 
processes to consciousness. After all, Peter Singer has no 
difficulty 
supposing that an insect might keep its act together 
without the help of such a central system. It is an open 
empirical question, or rather, a currently unimagined and 
complex set of open empirical questions, what sorts of "high 
levels" are to be found in which species under which 
conditions. 
Here, for instance, is one possibility to consider: the bat

lacks the brain-equipment for expressing 
judgments (in 
language), but the bat may nevertheless have to form 
judgments (of some inarticulate 
sort), in order to organize 
and modulate its language-free activities. Wherever these 
inarticulate 
judgment-like 
things happen is where we should 
look for the bat's privileged vantage point. But this would 
involve just the sort of postulation about sophisticated 
judgments that Nagel found so implausible to attribute 
to a 
baby. If the distinction 
between conscious and unconscious 
has nothing to do with anything 
sophisticated 
like judgment, 
what else could it involve? 
Let us return to our vultures. Consider the hypothesis 
that 
for all I could ever know, rotting chicken carcass smells to a 
turkey vulture exactly the way roast turkey smells to me. Can 
science shed any light, pro or con, on this hypothesis? 
Yes, it 
can almost effortlessly 
refute it: since how roast turkey 
tastes 
to me 
is composed (and exhausted) by the huge set of reactive 
dispositions, 
memory effects, 
and so on, and so forth, 
that are 
detectable in principle in my brain and behavior, and since 
many of these are utterly beyond the machinery of any 
vulture's 
brain, it is flat impossible 
that anything 
could smell to 
a vulture the way roast turkey smells to me. 
Well, then, what does rotting chicken smell like to a turkey 
vulture? (Exactly?) How patient and inquisitive are you 
prepared to be? We can uncover the corresponding 
family of 
reactive dispositions 
in the vulture by the same methods that 
work for me, and as we do, we will learn more and more 
about the no doubt highly idiosyncratic 
relations a vulture 
can form to a set of olfactory 
stimuli. But we already know a 
lot that we wont learn. We will never find a vulture being 
provoked by those stimuli to wonder, as a human being 
might, whether the chicken is not just slightly off tonight. 
And we won't find any amusement or elaborate patterns of 
association or Proustian reminiscence. 
Am I out in front of 
the investigations 
here? A little bit, but note what kind of 
investigations 
they are. It turns out that we end up where we

SOCIAL RESEARCH 
began: analyzing patterns 
of behavior (external and internal- 
but not "private"), and attempting 
to interpret them in the 
light of evolutionary hypotheses regarding their past or 
current functions. 
The very idea of there being a dividing line between those 
creatures "it is like something 
to be" and those that are mere 
"automata" begins to look like an artifact of our traditional 
presumptions. 
I have offered (Dennett, 1991) a variety of 
reasons for concluding that in the case of adult human 
consciousness there is no principled way of distinguishing 
when or if the mythic 
light bulb of consciousness 
is turned on 
(and shone on this or that item). Consciousness, 
I claim, even 
in the case we understand best- our own- is not an 
all-or-nothing, 
on-or-off 
phenomenon. If this is right, then 
consciousness 
is not the sort of phenomenon 
it is assumed to be 
by most of the participants in the debates over animal 
consciousness. Wondering whether it is "probable" that all 
mammals have it thus begins to look like wondering whether 
or not any birds are wise or reptiles have gumption: 
a case of 
overworking 
a term from folk psychology 
that has losts its 
utility 
along with its hard edges. 
Some thinkers 
are unmoved by this prospect. They are still 
unshakably 
sure that consciousness- "phenomenal" conscious- 
ness, in the terms of Ned Block (1992, 1993, 1995, 
forthcoming)- 
is a phenomenon that is either present or 
absent, rather as if some events in the brain glowed in the dark 
and the rest did not.2 Of course, if you simply will not 
contemplate 
the hypothesis 
that consciousness 
might turn out 
not to be a property 
that thus sunders the universe in twain, 
you will be sure that I must have overlooked consciousness 
altogether. But then you should also recognize that you 
maintain the mystery 
of consciousness 
by simply refusing to 
consider the evidence for one of the most promising 
theories 
of it.

ANIMAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
707 
Postscript: 
Pain, Suffering, 
and Morality 
In the discussion following my presentation 
at the confer- 
ence at the New School, attention 
was focused on a question 
about animal consciousness that is not explicitly addressed 
above: according to my model, how would one tell which 
animals were capable of pain or suffering 
(or both)? Drawing 
on the presentations 
and discussions 
later in the conference, 
I 
offer here an oversimplified 
sketch of the direction my theory 
recommends 
for answering 
this question.3 
The phenomenon of pain is neither homogeneous across 
species nor simple. We can see this in ourselves, 
by noting how 
unobvious the answers are to some simple questions. Are the 
"pains" that usefully prevent us from allowing our limbs to 
assume awkward, joint-damaging positions while we sleep 
experiences that require a "subject" (McGinn, 1995), or might 
they be properly 
called unconscious pains? Do they have moral 
significance 
in any case? Such body-protecting 
states of the 
nervous system might be called "sentient" states without 
thereby implying 
that they were the experiences of any self, 
any ego, any subject. For such states to matter- whether 
or not 
we call them pains or conscious states or experiences- there 
must be an enduring, complex 
subject to whom they matter 
because they are a source of suffering. 
Snakes (or parts of 
snakes!) may feel pain- depending on how we choose to 
define that term- but the evidence mounts that snakes lack the 
sort of over-arching, 
long-term 
organization 
that leaves room 
for significant 
suffering. 
That does not mean that we ought to 
treat snakes the way we treat worn out tires, but just that 
concern for their suffering should be tempered by an 
appreciation 
of how modest their capacities for suffering 
are. 
While the distinction 
between pain and suffering 
is, like 
most everyday, 
nonscientific 
distinctions, 
somewhat blurred at 
the edges, it is, nevertheless, a valuable and intuitively 
satisfying 
mark or measure of moral importance. 
When I step 
on your toe, causing a brief but definite (and definitely

SOCIAL RESEARCH 
conscious) pain, I do you scant harm -typically none at all. 
The pain, though intense, is too brief to matter, and I have 
done no long-term 
damage to your foot. The idea that you 
"suffer" 
for a second or two is a risible misapplication 
of that 
important 
notion, and even when we grant that my causing 
you a few seconds pain may irritate 
you a few more seconds or 
even minutes 
-especially if you think I did it deliberately- 
the 
pain itself, as a brief, negatively-signed 
experience, is of 
vanishing 
moral significance. 
(If in stepping on your toe I have 
interrupted 
your singing of the aria, thereby ruining your 
operatic career, that is quite another matter.) 
Many discussions seem to assume tacitly: (1) that suffering 
and pain are the same thing, on a different 
scale; (2) that all 
pain is "experienced pain"; and (3) that "amount of suffering" 
is to be calculated ("in principle") by just adding up all the 
pains (the awfulness of each of which is determined by 
duration-times-intensity). 
These assumptions, 
looked at dispas- 
sionately in the cold light of day- a difficult 
feat for some 
partisans- are ludicrous. A little exercise may help: would you 
exchange the sum total of the suffering 
you will experience 
during the next year for one five-minute 
blast of no doubt 
excruciating 
agony that summed up to the "same amount" of 
total pain-and-suffering? 
I certainly 
would. In fact, I would 
gladly take the bargain even if you "doubled" or "quadrupled" 
the total annual amount- just so long as it would be all over in 
five minutes. (We are assuming, of course, that this horrible 
episode does not kill me or render me insane- after the pain is 
over- or have other long-term 
effects 
that amount to or cause 
me further 
suffering; 
the deal was to pack all the suffering 
into 
one jolt.) I expect anybody would be happy to make such a 
deal. But it doesn't really make sense. It implies that the 
benefactor who provided such a service gratis to all, ex 
hypothesi, 
would be doubling or quadrupling the world's 
suffering- 
and the world would love him for it. 
It seems obvious to me that something is radically wrong 
with the assumptions that permit us to sum and compare

suffering 
in any such straightforward 
way. But some people 
think otherwise; one person's reductio 
ad absurdum 
is another's 
counter-intuitive 
discovery. We ought to be able to sort out 
these differences, 
calmly, even if the best resolution we can 
reasonably hope for is a recognition that some choices of 
perspective 
are cognitively 
impenetrable. 
Notes 
1 Two rare- and widely misunderstood- 
exceptions to this tradi- 
tion are Julian Jaynes (1976) and Howard Margolis (1987), whose 
cautious observations 
survey the field of investigation 
I am proposing 
to open: 
A creature with a very large brain, capable of storing large 
numbers of complex patterns, 
and capable of carrying 
through 
elaborate sequences of internal representations, 
with this 
capability 
refined and elaborated to a very high degree, would 
be a creature like you and me. Somehow, as I have stressed, 
consciousness 
conspicuously 
enters the scheme at this point of 
highly elaborate dynamic internal representations. 
Correctly 
or 
not, most of us find it hard to imagine that an insect is conscious, 
at least conscious in anything 
approximating 
the sense in which 
humans are conscious. But it is hard to imagine that a dog is not 
conscious in at least something 
like the way an infant is conscious 
(Margolis, 1987, p. 55). 
2 John Searle also holds fast to this myth. See, for example, Searle, 
1992, and my review, 1993.
