Digital Photography For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Introduction
I
n the 1840s, William Henry Fox Talbot combined light, paper, a few chemi-
cals, and a wooden box to produce a photographic print, laying the foun-
dation for modern film photography. Over the years, the process that Talbot
introduced was refined, and people everywhere discovered the joy of photog-
raphy. They started trading pictures of horses and babies. They began dis-
playing their handiwork on desks, mantels, and walls. And they finally figured
out what to do with those little plastic sleeves inside their wallets.
Today, more than 160 years after Talbot’s discovery, we’ve entered a new
photographic age. The era of the digital camera has arrived, and with it
comes a new and exciting way of thinking about photography. In fact, the
advent of digital photography has spawned an entirely new art form — one
so compelling that major museums now host exhibitions featuring the work
of digital photographers.
With a digital camera, a computer, and some photo-editing software, you can
explore unlimited creative opportunities. Even if you have minimal computer
experience, you can easily bend and shape the image that comes out of your
camera to suit your personal artistic vision. You can combine several pic-
tures into a photographic collage, for example, and create special effects that
are either impossible or difficult to achieve with film. You also can do your
own photo retouching, handling tasks that once required a professional
studio, such as cropping away excess background or sharpening focus.
More important, digital cameras make taking great pictures easier. Because
digital cameras have a monitor on which you can instantly review your shots,
you can see right away whether you have a keeper or need to try again. No
more picking up a packet of prints at the photo lab and discovering that you
didn’t get a single good picture of that first birthday party, or that incredible
ocean sunset, or whatever it was that you wanted to capture.
Digital photography also enables you to share visual information with people
around the world instantaneously. Literally minutes after snapping a digital
picture, you can put the photo in the hands of friends, colleagues, or
strangers across the globe by attaching it to an e-mail message or posting it
on the World Wide Web.
Blending the art of photography with the science of the computer age, digital
cameras serve as both an outlet for creative expression and a serious com-
munication tool. Just as important, digital cameras are fun. When was the last
time you could say that about a piece of computer equipment?

2
Digital Photography For Dummies, 5th Edition
Why a Book for Dummies?
Digital cameras have been around for several years, but at a price tag that
few people could afford. Now, entry-level cameras sell for less than $100,
which moves the technology out of the realm of exotic toy and into the hands
of ordinary mortals like you and me. Which brings me to the point of this
book (finally, you say).
Like any new technology, digital cameras can be a bit intimidating. Browse
the digital camera aisle in your favorite store, and you come face to face with
a slew of technical terms and acronyms — CCD, megapixel, JPEG, and the
like. These high-tech buzzwords may make perfect sense to the high-tech
folks who have been using digital cameras for a while. However, if you’re an
average consumer, hearing a camera salesperson utter a phrase like, “This
model has a 6-megapixel CCD and can store 280 images on a 256MB
CompactFlash card using maximum JPEG compression,” is enough to make
you run screaming back to the film counter.
Don’t. Instead, arm yourself with Digital Photography For Dummies, 5th
Edition. This book explains everything you need to know to become a suc-
cessful digital photographer. And you don’t need to be a computer or photog-
raphy geek to understand what’s going on. Digital Photography For Dummies
speaks your language — plain English, that is — with a dash of humor thrown
in to make things more enjoyable.
What’s in This Book?
Digital Photography For Dummies covers all aspects of digital photography,
from figuring out which camera you should buy to preparing your images for
printing or for publishing on the Web.
Part of the book provides information that can help you select the right digi-
tal photography equipment and photo software. Other chapters focus on
helping you use your camera to its best advantage. In addition, this book
shows you how to perform certain photo-editing tasks, such as adjusting
image brightness and contrast and creating photographic collages.
For some photo-editing techniques, I provide specific instructions for doing
the job in a popular photo-editing program, Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0.
However, if you use another program (or another version of Elements), don’t
think that this book isn’t for you. The basic editing tools that I discuss func-
tion similarly from program to program, and the general approach to editing
is the same no matter what program you use. So you can refer to this book
for the solid foundation you need to understand different editing functions
and then easily adapt the specific steps to your own photo software.

Although this book is designed for beginning- and intermediate-level digital
photographers, I do assume that you have a little bit of computer knowledge.
For example, you should understand how to start programs, open and close
files, and get around in the Windows or Macintosh environment, depending
on which type of system you use. If you’re brand-new to computers as well as
to digital photography, you may want to get a copy of the appropriate For
Dummies title for your operating system as an additional reference.
As a special note to my Macintosh friends, I want to emphasize that although
most of the figures in this book were created on a Windows-based computer,
this book is for Mac as well as Windows users. Whenever applicable, I pro-
vide instructions for both Macintosh and Windows systems.
Now that I’ve firmly established myself as neutral in the computer platform
wars, here’s a brief summary of the kind of information you can find in Digital
Photography For Dummies.
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder
This part of the book gets you started on your digital photography adven-
ture. The first two chapters help you understand what digital cameras can
and can’t do and how they perform their photographic magic. Chapter 3 helps
you track down the best camera for the type of pictures you want to take,
while Chapter 4 introduces you to some of the camera add-ons and other
accessories that make digital photography better, easier, or just more fun.
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot!
Are you photographically challenged? Are your pictures too dark, too light,
too blurry, or just plain boring? Before you fling your camera across the room
in frustration, check out this part of the book.
Chapter 5 gets you started, explaining which camera settings work best and
walking you through the process of taking your first pictures. Chapter 6
reveals the secret to capturing well-exposed, perfectly focused photographs,
and Chapter 7 presents tips to help you create more powerful, more exciting
images. In addition, this part of the book shows you how to capture a series
of photographs that you can stitch together into a panorama, how to deal
with difficult lighting situations, and how to take advantage of the latest
camera features, such as automatic shooting modes that make it easy for
anyone to be a better photographer.

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond
After you fill up your camera with photos, you need to get them off the
camera and out into the world. Chapters in this part of the book show you
how to do just that.
Chapter 8 explains the process of transferring pictures to your computer and
also discusses ways to organize all those images. Chapter 9 gives you a thor-
ough review of your printing options, including information about different
types of photo printers. And Chapter 10 looks at ways to display and distrib-
ute images electronically — placing them on Web pages and attaching them
to e-mail messages, for example.
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade
In this part of the book, you get an introduction to photo editing. Chapter 11
discusses simple fixes for problem pictures. Of course, after reading the
shooting tips in Part II, you shouldn’t wind up with many bad photos. But for
the occasional stinker, Chapter 11 comes to the rescue by showing you how
to adjust exposure, sharpen focus, and crop away unwanted portions of the
image.
Chapter 12 explains how to select a portion of your picture and then copy
and paste the selection into another image. You also find out how to cover up
flaws and unwanted photo elements. Chapter 13 presents some more-
advanced tricks, including painting on your image, building photo collages,
and applying special effects.
Keep in mind that coverage of photo editing in this book is intended just to
spark your creative appetite and give you a solid background for exploring
your photo software. If you want more details about using your software, you
can find excellent For Dummies books about many photo-editing programs. In
addition, one of my other books, Photo Retouching and Restoration For
Dummies, may be of interest to photographers who want in-depth informa-
tion about digital photo retouching.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Information in this part of the book is presented in easily digestible, bite-
sized nuggets. Chapter 14 contains the top ten ways to improve your digital
photographs; Chapter 15 offers ten ideas for using digital images; and
Chapter 16 lists ten great online resources for times when you need help sort-
ing out a technical problem or just want some creative inspiration. In other
words, Part V is perfect for the reader who wants a quick, yet filling, mental
snack.

Glossary
As you probably have already discovered, the digital photography world is
very fond of jargon. I explain all the terms and acronyms you need to know
throughout the book, but if you need a quick reminder of what a certain word
means, head for the glossary at the back of the book, where you can find
quick translations from geek-speak to everyday language. 
Online extras
Throughout this book, I introduce you to lots of software that can make your
digital photography life simpler and more enjoyable. In many cases, you can
try out the featured programs for free by simply downloading trial or demo
versions from the software vendor’s Web site.
To make it easy for you to access this try-before-you-buy software, I’ve put
together a Web page that contains links to the vendor sites. Just point your
Web browser to the following address:
www.dummies.com/go/digitalphotofd5e
The Web page also includes low-resolution versions of some of the pictures
used in this book. You may find it helpful to use these sample images as you
try out the various projects featured throughout the book.
Icons Used in This Book
Like other books in the For Dummies series, this book uses icons to flag espe-
cially important information. Here’s a quick guide to the icons used in Digital
Photography For Dummies.
As mentioned earlier, I sometimes provide steps for accomplishing a photo-
editing goal using Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0. The Elements How To icon
marks information specifically related to that program. But if you’re using
another program, you can adapt the general editing approach to your own
software, so don’t ignore paragraphs marked with the Elements How To icon.
This icon marks stuff that you should commit to memory. Doing so can make
your life easier and less stressful.
Text marked with this icon breaks technical gobbledygook down into plain
English. In many cases, you really don’t need to know this stuff, but boy, will
you sound impressive if you do.

The Tip icon points you to shortcuts that help you avoid doing more work
than necessary. This icon also highlights ideas for creating better pictures
and working around common digital photography problems.
When you see this icon, pay attention — danger is on the horizon. Read the
text next to a Warning icon to keep yourself out of trouble and to find out
how to fix things if you leaped before you looked.
Conventions Used in This Book
In addition to icons, Digital Photography For Dummies follows a few other con-
ventions. When I want you to choose a command from a menu, you see the
menu name, an arrow, and then the command name. For example, if I want
you to choose the Cut command from the Edit menu, I write it this way:
“Choose Edit➪Cut.”
Sometimes, you can choose a command more quickly by pressing two or
more keys on your keyboard than by clicking your way through menus. I pre-
sent these keyboard shortcuts like so: “Press Ctrl+A,” which simply means to
press and hold the Ctrl key, press the A key, and then let up on both keys.
Usually, I provide the PC shortcut first, followed by the Mac shortcut, if it’s
different.
What Do I Read First?
The answer depends on you. You can start with Chapter 1 and read straight
through to the Index, if you like. Or you can flip to whatever section of the
book interests you most and start there.
Digital Photography For Dummies is designed so that you can grasp the con-
tent in any chapter without having to read all chapters that came before. So if
you need information on a particular topic, you can get in and out as quickly
as possible.
The one thing this book isn’t designed to do, however, is to insert its con-
tents magically into your head. You can’t just put the book on your desk or
under your pillow and expect to acquire the information inside by osmosis —
you have to put eyes to page and do some actual reading.

With our hectic lives, finding the time and energy to read is always easier
said than done. But I promise that if you spend just a few minutes a day with
this book, you can increase your digital photography skills tenfold. Heck,
maybe even elevenfold or twelvefold. Suffice it to say that you’ll discover a
whole new way to communicate, whether you’re shooting for business, for
pleasure, or for both.
The digital camera is the new Big Thing. And with Digital Photography For
Dummies, you get the information you need in order to take advantage of this
powerful new tool — quickly, easily, and with a few laughs along the way.

Part I
Peering through the
Digital Viewﬁnder

In this part . . .
W
hen I was in high school, the science teach-
ers insisted that the only way to learn about
different creatures was to cut them open and poke
about their innards. In my opinion, dissecting dead
things never accomplished anything other than
giving the boys a chance to gross out the girls by
pretending to swallow formaldehyde-laced body
parts.
But even though I’m ﬁrmly against dissecting our
fellow earthly beings, I am wholly in favor of dis-
secting new technology. It’s my experience that
if you want to make a machine work for you,
you have to know what makes that machine tick.
Only then can you fully exploit its capabilities.
To that end, this part of the book dissects the
machine known as the digital camera. Chapter 1
looks at some of the pros and cons of digital pho-
tography, while Chapter 2 pries open the lid of a
digital camera so that you can get a better under-
standing of how the thing performs its magic.
Chapter 3 puts the magnifying glass to speciﬁc
camera features, giving you the background you
need to select the right camera for your photogra-
phy needs. Chapter 4 provides the same kind of
close inspection of camera accessories and digital
imaging software.
All right, put on your goggles and prepare to dis-
sect your digital specimens. And boys, no ﬂinging
camera parts around the room or sticking cables
up your noses, okay? Hey, that means you, mister!

I
love hanging out in computer stores. I’m not a major geek — not that
there’s anything wrong with that — I just enjoy seeing what new gadgets I
may be able to justify as tax write-offs.
You can imagine my delight, then, when digital cameras began showing up on
the store shelves at a price that even my meager budget could
handle. Here was a device that not only offered time and energy
savings for my business but, at the same time, was a really
cool toy for entertaining friends, family, and any
strangers I could corral on the street.
If you, too, have decided that the time is right to join
the growing ranks of digital photographers, I’d like
to offer a hearty “way to go!” — but also a little
word of caution. Before you hand over your money,
be sure that you understand how this new technol-
ogy works — and don’t rely on the salesperson in
your local electronics or computer superstore to fill
you in. From what I’ve observed, many salespeople
don’t fully understand digital photography. As a result,
they may steer you toward a camera that may be perfect
for someone else but doesn’t meet your needs.
Nothing’s worse than a new toy, er, business investment that doesn’t live up to
your expectations. Remember how you felt when the plastic action figure that
flew around the room in the TV commercial just stood there doing nothing
after you dug it out of the cereal box? To make sure that you don’t experience

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
the same letdown with a digital camera, this chapter sorts out the facts from
the fiction, explaining the pros and cons of digital imagery in general and digi-
tal cameras in particular.
Film? We Don’t Need No Stinkin’ Film!
As shown in Figure 1-1, digital cameras come in all shapes and sizes. (You can
see additional cameras throughout the next several chapters.) But although
designs and features differ from model to model, all digital cameras are cre-
ated to accomplish the same goal: to simplify the process of creating digital
images.
Figure 1-1: These models from Nikon, Olympus, Kodak, Fujifilm, and HP illustrate the variety of digital cameras.
When I speak of a digital image, I’m referring to a picture that you can view
and edit on a computer. Digital images, like anything else you see on your
computer screen, are nothing more than bits of electronic data. Your com-
puter analyzes that data and displays the image on-screen. (For a detailed
look at how digital images work, see Chapter 2.)
Digital images are nothing new — people have been creating and editing digi-
tal pictures using such programs as Adobe Photoshop for years. But until the
advent of digital cameras, getting a stunning sunset scene or an endearing
baby picture into digital form required some time and effort. After shooting

the picture with a film camera, you had to get the film developed and then
have the photographic print or slide digitized (that is, converted to a com-
puter image) using a piece of equipment known as a scanner. Assuming that
you weren’t well-off enough to have a darkroom and a scanner in the east
wing of your mansion, this process could take several days and involve sev-
eral middlemen and associated middleman costs.
Digital cameras provide an easier, more convenient option. While traditional
cameras capture images on film, digital cameras record what they see using
computer chips and digital storage devices, creating images that you can
immediately access on your computer. No film, film processing, or scanning
is involved — you press the shutter button, and voilà: You have a digital
image. To use the image, you simply transfer it from your camera to the com-
puter, which you can do in a variety of ways. With the latest digital cameras,
you can send your pictures directly to a photo printer — you don’t even need
a computer!
Fine, but Why Do I Want Digital Images?
Going digital opens up a world of artistic and practical possibilities that you
simply don’t enjoy with film. Here are just a few advantages of working with
digital images:
 More creative control: With traditional photos, you have no input into
an image after it leaves your camera. Everything rests in the hands of
the photofinisher. But with a digital photo, you can use your computer
and photo-editing software to touch up and enhance your pictures.
Figures 1-2 and 1-3 illustrate the point. Figure 1-2 shows an original digital
photo that I shot while taking a walk with the three girls and their moth-
ers. In addition to being slightly underexposed, the picture contains too
much background, and the sidewalk at the top of the shot creates an
unwanted distraction from the subjects. I opened the picture in my photo
editor and took care of all these problems in a few minutes. You can see
the much-improved picture in Figure 1-3.
You could argue that I could have created the same image with a film
camera by paying attention to the background, exposure, and framing
before I took the picture. But sometimes, the situation doesn’t allow that
kind of preparation. Had I taken the time to make sure that everything
was perfect before I pressed the shutter button, my opportunity to cap-
ture the interaction that was unfolding in front of me would have been
long gone. And had I asked the girls to stop and wait for me to take their
picture, they likely would have adopted a stiff pose that would be far less
endearing than this candid moment. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t
strive to shoot the best pictures possible, but if something goes awry,
you often can rescue marginal images in the editing stage.

Figure 1-3: A little photo editing turns a so-so image into a compelling 
summer memory.

 Instant, easy, photo sharing: You can send an image instantaneously by
attaching it to an e-mail message. Not only is electronic distribution of
images quicker than regular mail or overnight delivery services, it’s also
more convenient. You don’t have to address an envelope, find a stamp,
or truck off to the post office or delivery drop box.
In addition to sending photos via e-mail, you can share photos with
friends, family, and clients, no matter how far away, via a personal Web
page or a photo-sharing site such as the Kodak EasyShare Gallery (for-
merly Ofoto, www.kodakgallery.com), featured in Figure 1-4. (Chapter 10
explains everything you need to do to prepare your images for online
sharing or any type of on-screen display.)

 More interesting presentations: You can include pictures in business or
educational presentations that you create with programs such as
Microsoft PowerPoint. For more casual audiences, you can produce fun
multimedia slide shows and burn them to a CD or DVD using programs
such as PhotoShow Deluxe from Simple Star, shown in Figure 1-5.
 More useful databases and household records: You can include digital
images in business and household databases. For example, if your com-
pany operates a telemarketing program, you can insert images into a
product order database so that when sales reps pull up information
about a product, they see a picture of the product and can describe it to
customers. Or you may want to insert product shots into inventory
spreadsheets, as I did in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-5: PhotoShow Deluxe and other beginner-friendly programs allow you to easily create digital 
slide shows.

 More creative fun: You can have a lot of fun exploring your artistic side.
Using an image-editing program, you can apply wacky special effects,
paint mustaches on your evil enemy, and otherwise distort reality. 
You can also combine several images into a montage, such as the one
featured in Chapter 13, and apply special-effects filters that give your
photo the look of a painting, pencil sketch, or other traditional art
medium, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-6: You can insert digital images into spreadsheets to create a visual inventory.

You can also create your own personalized stationery, business cards,
calendars, mugs, t-shirts, postcards, and other goodies, as shown in
Figure 1-8. The figure offers a look at Microsoft Digital Image Pro, an
easy-to-use program that provides templates for creating such materials.
You just select the design you want to use and insert your own photos
into the template.
After you place your photos into the templates, you can print your art-
work on a color printer using specialized print media sold by Kodak,
Epson, HP, and other vendors. If you don’t have access to a printer with
this capability, you can get the job done at a local quick-copy shop or
e-mail your image to one of the many vendors offering digital printing
services via the Internet.
These are just some of the reasons digital imaging is catching on so quickly.
For convenience, quality control, flexibility, and fun, digital does a slam-dunk
on film.

Figure 1-8: Make a personal statement by creating your own invitations and greeting cards.
But Can’t I Do All This with a Scanner?
The answer is, yes. You can do everything that I mentioned in the preceding
section with any digital image, whether the picture comes from a scanner or
a digital camera. However, digital cameras provide some benefits that you
don’t enjoy when you work with film prints and a scanner:
 Print only the good ones: If you’re like most people, only a handful of
pictures from every roll of film falls into the category of “that’s a great
picture” or even “that’s an okay picture.” Divide the cost of film and 
processing by the number of good photos per roll, and you’ll discover
that you’re paying a lot more per picture than you thought.
With a digital camera, you can review your pictures on the camera’s
monitor and then print only those that are really special. If the picture
isn’t any good, you simply delete it. And because you’re no longer wast-
ing film, you can experiment freely with different camera settings and
photo techniques.

Chapter 1: Filmless Fun, Facts, and Fiction

20
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
 Never miss important photo ops: Instant, on-camera review of your pic-
tures also means added peace of mind when you’re photographing one-
time events such as an anniversary party or business conference. You
know right away whether you snapped a winner or need to try again. No
more disappointing moments at the film lab when you discover that
your packet of prints doesn’t contain a single decent picture of the
scene you wanted to capture.
 Save time and effort: If you shoot product pictures on a regular basis,
digital cameras offer significant timesavings. You don’t have to run off to
the lab and wait for your pictures to be processed.
In addition, digital cameras free up time that you would otherwise spend
scanning pictures into your computer. Even the best scanners are
painfully slow when compared with the time it takes to generate an
image with a digital camera. 
In short, digital cameras save you time and money and, most important,
make it easier to produce terrific pictures. 
Now Tell Me the Downside
Thanks to design and manufacturing refinements, problems that kept people
from moving to digital photography in the early days of the technology —
high prices and questionable image quality being the most critical — have
been solved. But a couple of downside issues remain, which I should bring up
in the interest of fairness:
 Today’s digital cameras can produce the same high quality prints as
you’ve come to expect from your film camera. However, to enjoy that
kind of picture quality, you need to start with a camera that offers 
moderate-to-high image resolution, which costs a minimum of $70.
Images from lower-priced models just don’t contain enough picture infor-
mation to produce decent prints. Low-resolution cameras are fine for pic-
tures that you want to use on a Web page or in a multimedia presentation,
however. (See Chapter 2 for a complete explanation of resolution.)
 After you press the shutter button on a digital camera, the camera
requires a few seconds to record the image to memory. During that time,
you can’t shoot another picture. With some cameras, you also experi-
ence a slight delay between the time you press the shutter button and
the time the camera captures the image. These lag times can be a prob-
lem when you’re trying to capture action-oriented events.
Generally speaking, the more expensive the camera, the less lag time
you encounter. With some of the new, top-flight models, lag time isn’t
much more than you experience with a film camera using an automatic
film advance.

Many digital cameras also offer a burst or continuous-capture mode that
enables you to take a series of pictures with one press of the shutter
button. This mode is helpful in some scenarios, although you’re some-
times restricted to capturing images at a low resolution or without a
flash. Chapter 7 provides more information.
 Becoming a digital photographer involves learning some new concepts
and skills. If you’re familiar with a computer, you shouldn’t have much
trouble getting up to speed with digital images. If you’re a novice to both
computers and digital cameras, expect to spend a fair amount of time
making friends with your new machines. A digital camera may look and
feel like your old film camera, but underneath the surface, it’s a far cry
from your father’s Kodak Brownie. This book guides you through the
process of becoming a digital photographer as painlessly as possible,
but you need to invest the time to read the information it contains.
As manufacturers continue to refine digital-imaging technology, you can expect
continued improvements in price and image-capture speed. I’m less hopeful
that anything involving a computer will become easier to learn in the near
future; my computer still forces me to “learn” something new every day — 
usually, the hard way. Of course, becoming proficient with film cameras requires
some effort as well.
Whether or not digital will completely replace film as the foremost photo-
graphic medium remains to be seen. In all likelihood, the two mediums will
each secure their niche in the image world. So make a place for your new dig-
ital camera in your camera bag, but don’t stick your film camera in the back
of the closet just yet. Digital photography and film photography each offer
unique advantages and disadvantages, and choosing one option to the exclu-
sion of the other limits your creative flexibility.
Just Tell Me Where to Send the Check. . . .
If you’ve been intrigued by the idea of digital photography but have so far
been put off by the costs involved, I have great news. Prices for cameras,
printers, and other necessary equipment have fallen dramatically over the
past few years. Camera features that would have cost you $600 two years ago
can now be had for under $100. (Don’t you wish everything would keep
coming down in price the way computer technology does?)
The following sections outline the various costs of going digital. As you read
this information, keep in mind that digital photography offers some money-
saving benefits to offset the expenses. As I mentioned earlier, you can experi-
ment without worrying about the cost of film and processing. If you don’t like
a picture, you simply delete it. No harm, no foul. If you’re a prolific photogra-
pher, this advantage alone adds up to significant savings over time. So even
though the initial outlay for a digital camera may be more than you’d pay for
a film camera, digital is cheaper over the long run.

Cameras
Today’s digital cameras range from inexpensive point-and-shoot models for
casual users to $1,500-and-up pro-sumer models that offer the high-end pho-
tography controls demanded by advanced photo enthusiasts and profes-
sional photographers.
You can get a bare-bones camera for less than $40. But models in this price
range produce very low-resolution images, suitable for Web pictures and
other on-screen uses only. They usually also lack some important conve-
nience features, such as removable image storage and a monitor for review-
ing pictures.
Expect to spend $70 and up for a camera that can generate quality prints and
includes a flash, LCD monitor, removable storage, and other features that
you’ll want if you plan to use your camera on a regular basis. As you move up
the price spectrum, you get higher resolution, which means that you can
print larger pictures; you also typically get better quality optics, a zoom lens,
and advanced features such as manual shutter speed and aperture control.
Chapter 3 helps you figure out just how much camera you need.
Memory cards
Most digital cameras record pictures on removable memory cards, which are
similar to the floppy disks that you may use with your computer. When you
fill up the card with pictures, you have to delete some pictures or transfer
them to your computer before you can continue shooting.
Memory cards used to be terribly expensive. In the first years of digital pho-
tography, you could spend as much as $20 per megabyte (MB) of memory.
Thankfully, memory card prices have plummeted recently, and you now can
buy a 256MB memory card for about $30.
How many pictures you can fit into that 256MB depends on camera resolu-
tion and image file format, two subjects that you can explore in the next two
chapters. 
Regardless, you can strike the cost of memory cards from your list of con-
cerns. You won’t spend any more than you would on film and processing to
produce an equivalent number of traditional prints. And you can reuse
memory cards as many times as you want, making them an even bigger bar-
gain when compared to film.

Hardware, software, and other accessories
In addition to the camera itself, digital photography involves some peripheral
hardware and software, not the least of which is a fairly powerful computer
for viewing, storing, editing, and printing your images. You need a machine
with a robust processor, at least 256MB of RAM, and a big hard drive with lots
of empty storage space. The least you can expect to spend on such a system
is about $400.
Getting your images from computer to paper requires an additional invest-
ment. If you have your pictures printed at a retail photofinishing lab, the cost
per print is equal to or sometimes lower than what you pay for film prints.
For do-it-yourself printing, printer costs range from about $80 to $700, but
you don’t need to buy at the high end of that spectrum to get good print qual-
ity. Most manufacturers use the same print engine in their low-priced photo
printers as they do in their top-of-the-line products, so you can get really
great results at a reasonable price. Higher-priced models offer faster output
and additional features such as networking capabilities, the option to print
directly from a camera memory card, a built-in monitor for previewing
images, and the ability to output very large prints.
In addition, you need to factor in the cost of image-editing software, image
storage and transfer devices, special paper for printing your photos, camera
batteries, and other peripherals. If you’re a real photography buff, you may
also want to buy special lenses, lights, a tripod, and some other accessories.
Nope, a digital darkroom isn’t cheap. Then again, neither is traditional film
photography, if you’re a serious photographer. And when you consider all the
benefits of digital imagery, especially if you do business nationally or interna-
tionally, justifying the expense isn’t all that difficult. But just in case you’re
getting queasy, look in Chapters 3, 4, and 9 for more details on the various
components involved in digital photography — plus some tips on how to cut
budgetary corners.

From Your Eyes to the Camera’s Memory
A traditional camera creates an image by allowing light to pass through a lens
onto film. The film is coated with light-sensitive chemicals, and wherever
light hits the coating, a chemical reaction takes place, recording a latent
image. During the film development stage, more chemicals transform the
latent image into a printed photograph.
Digital cameras also use light
to create images, but instead
of film, digital cameras cap-
ture pictures using an imaging
array or sensor, both of which
are fancy ways of saying
“light-sensitive computer
chips.” Currently, these
chips come in two flavors:
CCD, which stands for
charge-coupled device, and
CMOS, which is short for
complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor. (No, Billy, that information won’t be on the test.) Figure 2-1
gives you a look at some sensors from Kodak.
Although CCD and CMOS chips differ in some important ways, which you can
read about in Chapter 3, both chips do essentially the same thing. When
struck by light, they emit an electrical charge, which is analyzed and trans-
lated into digital image data by a processor inside the camera. The more
light, the stronger the charge.
After the electrical impulses are converted to image data, the data is saved to
the camera’s memory, which may come in the form of an in-camera chip or a
removable memory card or disk. To access the images that your camera
records, you just transfer them from the camera memory to your computer.
With some cameras, you can transfer pictures directly to a television monitor
or printer, enabling you to view and print your photographs without ever
turning on your computer.
Keep in mind that what you’ve just read is only a basic explanation of how
digital cameras record images. I could write an entire chapter on CCD
designs, for example, but you would only wind up with a big headache.
Besides, the only time you need to think about this stuff is when deciding
which camera to buy. To that end, Chapters 3, 4, and 8 explain the important
aspects of imaging chips, memory, and image transfer so that you can make a
sensible purchase decision.

The Secret to Living Color
Like film cameras, digital cameras create images by reading the light in a
scene. But how does the camera translate that brightness information into
the colors you see in the final photograph? As it turns out, a digital camera
does the job pretty much the same way as the human eye.
To understand how digital cameras — and your eyes — perceive color, you
first need to know that light can be broken into three color ranges: reds,
greens, and blues. Inside your eyeball, you have three receptors correspond-
ing to those color ranges. Each receptor measures the brightness of the light
for its particular range. Your brain then combines the information from the
three receptors into one multicolored image in your head.
Because most of us didn’t grow up
thinking about mixing red, green,
and blue light to create color, this
concept can be a little hard to
grasp. Here’s an analogy that may
help. Imagine that you’re standing in
a darkened room and have one
flashlight that emits red light, one
that emits green light, and one that
emits blue light. Now suppose that
you point all the flashlights at the
same spot on a white wall. Where
the three lights overlap, you get
white, as shown in Figure 2-2. Where
no light falls, you get black.
In the illustration, my flashlights
emit full-intensity light with no fade
over the spread of the beam, so mixing the three lights produces only three
additional colors: magenta, cyan, yellow. But by varying the intensity of the
beams, you can create every color that the human eye can see.
Just like your eyes, a digital camera analyzes the intensity — sometimes
referred to as the brightness value — of the red, green, and blue light. Then it
records the brightness values for each color in separate portions of the
image file. Digital-imaging professionals refer to these vats of brightness infor-
mation as color channels. After recording the brightness values, the camera
mixes them together to create the full-color image.
Pictures created using these three main colors of light are known as RGB
images — for red, green, and blue. Computer monitors, television sets, and
scanners also create images by combining red, green, and blue light.

In sophisticated photo-editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop, you can
view and edit the individual color channels in a digital image. Figure 2-3
shows a color image broken down into its red, green, and blue color chan-
nels. Notice that each channel contains nothing more than a grayscale image.
That’s because the camera records only light — or the absence of it — for
each channel.
Figure 2-3: An RGB image has three color channels, one each for the 
red, green, and blue light values.
Red Channel
RGB
Blue Channel
Green Channel

In any of the channel images, light areas indicate heavy amounts of that chan-
nel’s color. For example, the red portion of the left flag appears nearly white in
the red channel image, but nearly black in the green and blue channel images.
Likewise, the blue flag poles appear very light in the blue channel images. And
the white center portion of the left flag is bright in all three channel images;
remember, strong amounts of red, green, and blue light produce white.
At the risk of confusing the issue, I should point out that not all digital images
contain three channels. If you convert an RGB image to a grayscale (black-
and-white) image inside a photo-editing program, for example, the brightness
values for all three color channels are merged into one channel. And if you con-
vert the image to the CMYK color model in preparation for professional printing,
you end up with four color channels, one corresponding to each of the four
primary colors of ink (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). For more on this
topic, see “RGB, CMYK, and Other Colorful Acronyms,” later in this chapter.
Don’t let this channel stuff intimidate you — until you become a seasoned
photo editor, you don’t need to give it another thought. I bring the topic up
only so that when you see the term RGB, you have some idea what it means.
Resolution Rules!
Without a doubt, the number one thing you can do to improve your digital
photos is to understand the concept of resolution. Unless you make the right
choices about resolution, your pictures will be a disappointment, no matter
how captivating the subject. In other words, don’t skip this section!
Pixels: Building blocks of digital photos
Have you ever seen the painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La
Grande Jatte, by the French artist Georges Seurat? Seurat was a master of a
technique known as pointillism, in which scenes are composed of millions of
tiny dots of paint, created by dabbing the canvas with the tip of a paintbrush.
When you stand across the room from a pointillist painting, the dots blend
together, forming a seamless image. Only when you get up close to the
canvas can you distinguish the individual dots.
Digital images work something like pointillist paintings. Rather than being
made up of dots of paint, however, digital images are composed of tiny
squares of color known as pixels. The term pixel is short for picture element.
If you magnify an image on-screen, you can make out the individual pixels, as
shown in Figure 2-4. Zoom out on the image, and the pixels seem to blend
together, just as when you step back from a pointillist painting.

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
Figure 2-4: Zooming in on a digital photo enables you to see the individual pixels.
Every digital photograph is born with a set number of pixels, which you con-
trol by using the capture settings on your digital camera. (See Chapter 5 for
details.) Most cameras today can record at least one million pixels, and
higher-end models can capture six megapixels or more.
Some people use the term pixel dimensions to refer to the number of pixels in
an image — number of pixels wide by number of pixels high. Others use the
term image size, which can lead to confusion because that term is also used
to refer to the physical dimensions of the picture when printed (inches wide
by inches tall). For the record, I use pixel dimensions to refer specifically to
the pixel count and image size or print size to mean the print dimensions.
As I detail in the next few sections, the number of pixels affects three impor-
tant aspects of a digital photo:

 The maximum size at which you can produce good prints
 The display size of the picture when viewed on a computer monitor or
television screen
 The size of the image file
Pixels and print quality
Before you print an image, you
use a control in your photo editor
to specify an output resolution,
which determines the number of
pixels per inch (ppi) in the print.
Figure 2-5 shows the control as it
appears in Adobe Photoshop
Elements 3 (Chapter 9 provides
specifics).
Output resolution, which many
people refer to as image resolu-
tion or simply resolution, plays a
big role in determining the qual-
ity of your printed digital photos.
The more pixels per inch — the
higher the ppi — the crisper the
picture, as illustrated by Figures
2-6 through 2-8. The first image has resolution of 300 ppi; the second, 150 ppi;
and the third, 75 ppi.
Figure 2-6: A photo with an output resolution of 300 ppi looks terrific.

Figure 2-7: At 150 ppi, the picture loses some sharpness and detail.
Figure 2-8: Reducing the resolution to 75 ppi causes significant image degradation.
75 ppi
150 ppi

Note that output resolution is measured in terms of pixels per linear inch, not
square inch. So a resolution of 75 ppi means that you have 75 pixels horizon-
tally and 75 pixels vertically, or 5625 pixels for each square inch of your
printed image.
Why does the 75-ppi image in Figure 2-8 look so much worse than its higher-
resolution counterparts? Because at 75 ppi, the pixels are bigger. After all, if
you divide an inch into 75 squares, the squares are significantly larger than if
you divide the inch into 150 squares or 300 squares. And the bigger the pixel,
the more easily your eye can figure out that it’s really just looking at a bunch
of squares. Areas that contain diagonal and curved lines, such as the edges of
the coins and the handwritten lettering in the figure, take on a stair-stepped
appearance.
If you look closely at the black borders that surround Figures 2-6 through 2-8,
you can get a clearer idea of how resolution affects pixel size. Each image
sports a 2-pixel border. But the border in Figure 2-8 is twice as thick as the
one in Figure 2-7 because a pixel at 75 ppi is twice as large as a pixel at 150
ppi. Similarly, the border around the 150-ppi image in Figure 2-7 is twice as
wide as the border around the 300-ppi image in Figure 2-6.
Pixels and screen images
Although output resolution (ppi) has a dramatic effect on the quality of
printed photos, it’s a moot point for pictures displayed on-screen. A com-
puter monitor (or other display device) cares only about the pixel dimen-
sions, not pixels per inch, despite what you may have been told by some
folks. The number of pixels does control the size at which the picture
appears on the screen, however.
Like digital cameras, computer monitors (and other display devices) create
everything you see on-screen out of pixels. You typically can choose from
several monitor settings, each of which results in a different number of
screen pixels. Standard settings include 640 x 480 pixels, 800 x 600 pixels, and
1024 x 768 pixels.
When you display a digital photo on your computer monitor, the monitor
completely ignores any output resolution (ppi) setting you may have selected
in your photo-editing program and simply devotes one screen pixel to every
image pixel. For example, Figure 2-9 shows my 19-inch monitor as it appears
when set to a screen resolution of 1024 x 768. The Pompeii photo inside the
e-mail window contains 640 x 480 pixels — and therefore consumes 640 of the
available 1024 horizontal screen pixels and 480 of the 768 vertical pixels.

Figure 2-9: You don’t need many pixels to fill a computer screen.
This fact is great news for digital photographers with low budgets, because
even the most inexpensive digital camera captures enough pixels to cover a
large expanse of on-screen real estate. And again, the pixel count doesn’t
alter the on-screen quality; all that varies is the display size of the photo.
For more specifics on sizing pictures for the screen, turn to Chapter 10.
Pixels and file size
Each pixel in a digital photo adds to the size of the image file. For a point of
comparison, the high-resolution coin image in Figure 2-6 measures 1110
pixels wide and 725 pixels tall, for a total pixel count of 804,750. This file con-
sumes roughly 2.3MB (megabytes) of storage space. By contrast, the 75-ppi
image in Figure 2-8 measures 278 pixels wide by 181 pixels tall, for a total of
50,318 pixels. This image has a file size of just 153K (kilobytes).

768
1024

In addition to eating up storage space on your computer’s hard drive and on
your camera memory cards, large image files make bigger demands on your
computer’s memory (RAM) when you edit them. And when placed on a Web
page, huge image files are a major annoyance. Every kilobyte increases the
time required to download the file.
To avoid straining your computer — and the patience of Web site visitors —
keep your images lean and mean. You want the appropriate number of pixels
to suit your final output device (screen or printer), but no more. You can find
details on preparing images for print in Chapter 9 and read about designing
pictures for screen use in Chapter 10.
Keep in mind, too, that color image files are larger than black-and-white pic-
tures, or grayscale photos, as they’re called in the biz. That’s because of the
aforementioned color channel issue; a color image requires three channels of
data, while a grayscale photo requires only one. As an example, both photos
in Figure 2-10 have the same pixel dimensions (750 x 940). But the grayscale
image file size (714K) is about one-third the size of the full-color version
(2.1MB).

How many pixels are enough?
Because printers and screen devices think about pixels differently, your pixel
needs vary depending on how you plan to use your picture.
 Pixels for screen use: If you want to use your picture on a Web page, a
multimedia presentation, or for some other on-screen use, you need
very few pixels. As I explain in the preceding section, you just match the
pixel dimensions of the picture to the amount of the screen you want the
image to fill. In most cases, 640 x 480 pixels is more than enough, and for
many projects, you need half that many pixels or even fewer. 
 Pixels for prints: If you plan to print your photo and want the best pic-
ture quality, you need enough pixels to enable you to set the output res-
olution in the neighborhood of 200 to 300 ppi. This number varies
depending on the printer; sometimes you can get by with fewer pixels;
some printers (certain Epson models, notably) ask for 360 pixels. Check
your printer manual for resolution guidelines, and see Chapter 9 for
additional printing information.
To determine how many pixels you need, just multiply the print size by
the desired resolution. For example, if you want to create a 4 x 6-inch
print at 300 ppi, you need at least 1200 x 1800 pixels. (For the math-haters
in the group, Chapter 5 and the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book con-
tain a handy reference chart to pixels and print sizes.)
Because I’ve hammered home the point that more pixels means better print
quality, you may think that if 300 ppi delivers good print quality, 400 ppi or
even higher produces even better quality. But this isn’t the case. Printers are
engineered to work with images set to a particular resolution, and when pre-
sented with an image file at a higher resolution, most printers simply ignore
or eliminate the extra pixels.
Some cameras offer a setting that enables you to record two copies of each
image, one appropriate for print and one for on-screen use. If your camera
lacks this function and you’re not sure how you’re going to use your photos,
set your camera to the setting that’s suitable for print. If you later want to use
a picture on a Web page or for some other on-screen use, you can delete
extra pixels as necessary. But you can’t add pixels after the fact with any
degree of success. For more about this subject, see the next section.
Can’t I add pixels later?
Many photo-editing programs enable you to add pixels to or delete pixels
from an existing digital photo. This process is known as resampling. Adding
pixels is sometimes called upsampling; dumping pixels, downsampling.

Upsampling sounds like a good idea — if you don’t have enough pixels, you
just go to the Pixel Mart and fill your basket, right? The problem is that when
you add pixels, the photo-editing software simply makes its best guess as to
what color and brightness to make the new pixels. And even high-end photo-
editing programs don’t do a very good job of pulling pixels out of thin air, as
illustrated by Figure 2-11.
Figure 2-11: Here you see the result of upsampling the 75-ppi image in 
Figure 2-8 to 300 ppi.
To create this figure, I started with the 75-ppi image shown in Figure 2-8 and
resampled the image to 300 ppi in Adobe Photoshop, one of the best photo-
editing programs available. Compare this new image with the 300-ppi version in
Figure 2-6, and you can see just how poorly the computer does at adding pixels.
With some images, you can get away with minimal upsampling — say, 10 to
15 percent — but with other images, you notice a quality loss with even slight
pixel infusions. Images with large, flat areas of color tend to survive upsam-
pling better than pictures with lots of intricate details. See Chapter 9 for
information about how to make this adjustment during the printing process.
If your image contains too many pixels, which is often the case for pictures
that you want to use on the Web, you can safely delete pixels (downsample).
But keep in mind that every pixel you throw away contains image informa-
tion, so too much pixel-dumping can degrade image quality. Try not to down-
sample by more than 25 percent, and always make a backup copy of your
image in case you ever want those original pixels back.

More mind-boggling resolution stuff
As if sorting out all the pixel, resampling, and resolution stuff discussed in
the preceding sections isn’t challenging enough, you also need to be aware
that resolution doesn’t always refer to output resolution. The term is also
used to describe the capabilities of digital cameras, monitors, and printers.
So when you hear the word resolution, keep the following distinctions in
mind:
 Camera resolution: Digital camera manufacturers often use the term res-
olution to describe the number of pixels in the pictures produced by
their cameras. A camera’s stated resolution might be 640 x 480 pixels or
1.3 million pixels, for example. But those values refer to the pixel dimen-
sions or total pixels a camera can produce, not the number of pixels per
inch in your printed photos. You determine that value in your photo-
editing software, as I discuss in Chapter 9. Of course, you can use the
camera’s pixel count to figure out the final resolution you can achieve
from your images. See the earlier section, “How many pixels are
enough?”
Some vendors use the term VGA resolution to indicate a 640 x 480-pixel
image, XGA resolution to indicate a 1024 x 768-pixel image, and megapixel
resolution to indicate a total pixel count of 1 million or more.
 Monitor resolution: Manufacturers of computer monitors also use the
word resolution to describe the number of pixels a monitor can display.
As I mentioned a few sections ago, most monitors enable you to choose
from display settings of 640 x 480 pixels (again, often referred to as VGA
resolution), 800 x 600 pixels, or 1024 x 768 pixels (XGA). Some monitors
can display even more pixels.
See Chapter 10 to get more details about how screen resolution relates
to image resolution.
 Printer resolution: Printer resolution is measured in dots per inch, or
dpi, rather than pixels per inch. But the concept is similar: Printed
images are made up of tiny dots of color, and dpi is a measurement of
how many dots per inch the printer can produce. In general, the higher
the dpi, the smaller the dots, and the better the printed image. But gaug-
ing a printer solely by dpi can be misleading. Different printers use dif-
ferent printing technologies, some of which result in better images than
others. Some 300-dpi printers deliver better results than some 600-dpi
printers.

Some people (including some printer manufacturers and software
designers) mistakenly interchange dpi and ppi, which leads many users
to think that they should set their image resolution to match their
printer resolution. But a printer dot is not the same thing as an image
pixel. Most printers use multiple printer dots to reproduce one image
pixel. Every printer is geared to handle a specific image resolution, so
you need to check your computer manual for the right image resolution
for your model. See Chapter 9 for more information on printing and dif-
ferent types of printers.
What all this resolution stuff means to you
Head starting to hurt? Mine, too. So to help you sort out all the information
you accumulated by reading the preceding sections, here’s a brief summary
of resolution matters that matter most:
 Number of pixels across (or down) ÷ printed image width (or height) =
output resolution (ppi). For example, 600 pixels divided by 2 inches
equals 300 ppi.
 For good-quality prints, you typically need an output resolution of 200
to 300 ppi. Chapter 9 provides in-depth information on this topic.
 For on-screen display, think in terms of pixel dimensions, not output
resolution. See Chapter 10 for specifics.
 Enlarging a print can reduce image quality. When you enlarge an
image, one of two things has to happen. Either the existing pixels must
get larger to fit the new image boundaries, or the pixels stay the same
size and the photo-editing software adds pixels to fill in the gaps
(upsamples the image). Either way, your image quality can suffer.
 To safely raise the output resolution of an existing image, reduce the
print size. Again, adding pixels to raise the output resolution rarely
delivers good results. Instead, retain the existing number of pixels and
reduce the print dimensions of the picture. Chapter 9 provides the com-
plete scoop on resizing images in this manner.
 Set your camera to capture a pixel count at or above what you need
for your final picture output. You can safely toss pixels if you want a
lower image resolution later, but you can’t add pixels without degrading
your image. Also, you may need a low-resolution image today — for
example, if you want to display a picture on the Web — but you may
decide later that you want to print the image at a larger size, in which
case you’re going to need those extra pixels.
39
Chapter 2: Mr. Science Explains It All

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
 More pixels means a bigger image file. And even if you have tons of file-
storage space to hold all those huge images, bigger isn’t always better,
for two reasons:
• Large images require a ton of RAM to edit and increase the time
your photo software needs to process your edits.
• On a Web page, large image files mean long download times.
If your image has a higher resolution than you need, see Chapter 10 for
information on how to dump the excess pixels.
Lights, Camera, Exposure!
Whether you’re working with a digital camera or a traditional film camera,
the brightness or darkness of the image is dependent on exposure — the
amount of light that hits the film or image-sensor array. The more light, the
brighter the image. Too much light results in a washed-out, or overexposed,
image; too little light, and the image is dark, or underexposed.
Most low-priced digital cameras, like point-and-shoot film cameras, don’t give
you much control over exposure; everything is handled automatically for
you. But many midrange cameras offer a choice of automatic exposure set-
tings, and higher-end cameras typically provide manual exposure control in
addition to automatic options.
Regardless of whether you’re shooting with an automatic model or one that
offers manual controls, you should be aware of the different factors that
affect exposure — including shutter speed, aperture, and ISO — so that you
can understand the limitations and possibilities of your camera.
Aperture, f-stops, and shutter speeds: 
The traditional way
Before taking a look at how digital cameras control exposure, it helps to
understand how a film camera does the job. Even though digital cameras
don’t function in quite the same way as a film camera, manufacturers describe
their exposure control mechanisms using traditional film terms, hoping to
make the transition from film to digital easier for experienced photographers.
Figure 2-12 shows a simplified illustration of a film camera. Although the spe-
cific component design varies depending on the type of camera, all film cam-
eras include some sort of shutter, which is placed between the film and the
lens. When the camera isn’t in use, the shutter is closed, preventing light

from reaching the film. When you take a picture, the shutter opens, and light
hits the film. (Now you know why the little button you press to take a picture
is called the shutter button and why people who take lots of pictures are called
shutterbugs.)
You can control the amount of light that reaches the film in two ways: by
adjusting the amount of time the shutter stays open (referred to as the shutter
speed) and by changing the aperture. The aperture, labeled in Figure 2-12, is a
hole in an adjustable diaphragm set between the lens and the shutter. Light
coming through the lens is funneled through this hole to the shutter and then
onto the film. So if you want more light to strike the film, you make the aper-
ture bigger; if you want less light, you make the aperture smaller.
Figure 2-12: A look at the shutter and aperture in a traditional film camera.
The size of the aperture opening is measured in f-numbers, more commonly
referred to as f-stops. Standard aperture settings are f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6,
f/8, f/11, f/16, and f/22.
Contrary to what you may expect, the larger the f-stop number, the smaller
the aperture and the less light that enters the camera. Each f-stop setting lets
in half as much light as the next smaller f-stop number. For example, the
camera gets twice as much light at f/11 as it does at f/16. (And here you were
complaining that computers were confusing!) See Figure 2-13 for an illustra-
tion that may help you get a grip on f-stops.
41
Chapter 2: Mr. Science Explains It All

42
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
Figure 2-13: As the f-stop number decreases, the aperture size grows and more light 
enters the camera.
Shutter speeds are measured in more obvious terms: fractions of a second. A
shutter speed of 1/8, for example, means that the shutter opens for one-
eighth of a second. That may not sound like much time, but in camera years,
it’s in fact a very long period. Try to capture a moving object at that speed
and you wind up with a big blur. You need a shutter speed of about 1/500 to
capture action clearly.
On cameras that offer aperture and shutter speed control, you manipulate
the two settings in tandem to capture just the right amount of light. For exam-
ple, if you’re capturing fast action on a bright, sunny day, you can combine a
fast shutter speed with a small aperture (high f-stop number). To shoot the
same picture at twilight, you need a wide-open aperture (small f-stop
number) in order to use the same fast shutter speed.

Aperture, shutter speed, and f-stops: The digital way
As with a film camera, the exposure of a picture shot with a digital camera
depends on the amount of light that the camera captures. But some digital
cameras don’t use a traditional shutter/aperture arrangement to control
exposure. Instead, the chips in the image-sensor array simply turn on and off
for different periods of time, thereby capturing more or less light. In some
cameras, exposure is also varied — either automatically or by some control
the user sets — by boosting or reducing the strength of the electrical charge
that a chip emits in response to a certain amount of light.
Even on cameras that use this alternative approach to exposure control, the
camera’s capabilities are usually stated in traditional film-camera terms. For
example, you may have a choice of two exposure settings, which may be
labeled with icons that look like the aperture openings shown in Figure 2-13.
The settings are engineered to deliver the equivalent exposure that you
would get with a film camera using the same f-stop.
Aperture and shutter speeds aren’t the only factors involved in image expo-
sure, however. The sensitivity of the image-sensor array also plays a role, as
the next section explains.
ISO ratings and chip sensitivity
Pick up a box of film, and you should see an ISO number. This number tells
you how sensitive the film is to light and is also referred to as the film speed.
Film geared to the consumer market typically offers ratings of ISO 100, 200, or
400. The higher the number, the more sensitive the film, or, if you prefer pho-
tography lingo, the faster the film. And the faster the film, the less light you
need to capture a decent image. The advantage of using a faster film is that
you can use a faster shutter speed and shoot in dimmer lighting than you can
with a low-speed film. On the downside, photos shot with fast film sometimes
exhibit noticeable grain — that is, they have a slightly speckled appearance.
Most digital camera manufacturers also provide an ISO rating for their cam-
eras. This number tells you the equivalent sensitivity of the chips on the image-
sensor array. In other words, the value reflects the speed of film you’d be using
if you were using a traditional camera rather than a digital camera. Typically,
consumer-model digital cameras have an equivalency of about ISO 100.
I bring all this up because it explains why digital cameras need so much light
to produce a decent image. If you were really shooting with ISO 100 film, you
would need a wide-open aperture or a slow shutter speed to capture an image
in low lighting — assuming that you weren’t aiming for the ghostly-shapes-in-
a-dimly-lit-cave effect on purpose. The same is true of digital cameras.

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
Some digital cameras enable you to choose from a few different ISO settings.
Unfortunately, raising the ISO setting simply boosts the electronic signal
that’s produced when you snap a picture. Although this does permit a faster
shutter speed, the extra signal power usually also results in electronic
“noise” that leads to grainy pictures, just as you get with fast film. Most
camera manuals suggest using the lowest ISO setting for best quality — as
do I. However, if you’re working with a newer model camera, especially a 
digital SLR, do some experimenting; some cameras exhibit remarkably little
noise even at higher ISO settings. Chapter 6 discusses ISO and other expo-
sure issues in more detail.
A bit about bit depth
If you own a high-end digital camera, it may
enable you to choose between two bit depth
settings. A bit is a chunk of computer data. Bit
depth refers to how many bits are available to
store color data. A higher bit depth allows more
image colors.
Bit depth is stated either in terms of total bits or
in bits per color channel. For example, a stan-
dard RGB image has 8 bits per channel, for a
total of 24 bits (8 each for the red, green, and
blue color channels). Images that contain more
than 24 bits are known as high-bit images. High-
bit RGB images contain as many as 16 bits per
channel, or 48 bits total.
With 24 bits, you can capture about 16.7 million
colors, which is typically more than enough. So
what’s the advantage to more bits? Those extra
bits may be useful if you need to adjust exposure
or color in your photo editor. If you apply heavy
changes to a 24-bit image, you can sometimes
introduce a defect called bandingor posterization,
where abrupt color changes interrupt what
should be a smooth transition of hues, as shown
in the right image in the following figure.
Theoretically, higher-bit images withstand more
correction without breaking down because you
have more original color data to manipulate.
However, going to 48 bits does not guarantee
that this defect won’t occur. And high-bit
images have two important drawbacks: Files
are significantly larger, and many photo-editing
programs either can’t open high-bit files or
severely limit the number of tools that you can
use on those files.
For my part, I stick with 24 bits unless I’m shooting
in tricky light, in which case I might ramp up to
48 bits. In the photo-editing stage, I first make any
necessary exposure or color adjustments and
then convert the photo to a 24-bit image so that I
can have full access to all my photo-editing tools.
(To make this conversion in Adobe Photoshop
Elements, choose Image➪Mode➪8 bits/channel.)

RGB, CMYK, and Other Colorful Acronyms
If you read “The Secret to Living Color,” earlier in this chapter, you already
know that cameras, scanners, monitors, and television sets are called RGB
devices because they create images by mixing red, green, and blue light.
When you edit digital photographs, you also mix red, green, and blue light to
create the colors that you apply with your software’s painting tools.
But RGB is just one of many color-related acronyms and terms you may
encounter on your digital photography adventures. So that you aren’t con-
fused when you encounter these buzzwords, the following list offers a brief
explanation:
 RGB: Just to refresh your memory,
RGB stands for red, green, and
blue. RGB is the color model — that
is, a method for defining colors —
used by digital images, as well as
any device that transmits or filters
light. Figure 2-14 shows you how
full-intensity red, green, and blue
are mixed to create white, cyan,
yellow, and magenta.
Image-editing gurus also use the
term color space when discussing a
color model, something they do
with surprising frequency.
 sRGB: A variation of the RGB color
model, sRGB offers a smaller
gamut, or range of colors, than
RGB. One reason this color model was designed was to improve color
matching between on-screen and printed images. Because RGB devices
can produce more colors than printer inks can reproduce, limiting the
range of available RGB colors helps increase the possibility that what
you see on-screen is what you get on paper. The sRGB color model also
aims to define standards for on-screen colors so that images on a Web
page look the same on one viewer’s monitor as they do on another.
The sRGB color model is a topic of much debate right now. Many image-
editing purists hate sRGB; others see it as a necessary solution to the
color-matching problem. If your camera enables you to specify whether
you want to shoot in RGB or sRGB, I suggest choosing RGB to capture
the widest range of colors. For the same reason, also edit your photos in
RGB, and not sRGB, if your photo software gives you the choice. You can
always create an sRGB copy of your RGB original for Web use if you like.
And if you have color-matching problems when printing your photos,
see Chapter 9 for some possible fixes.

on red, green, and blue light.

 CMY/CMYK: While light-based
devices mix red, green, and blue
light to create images, printers mix
ink to emblazon a page with color.
Instead of red, green, and blue,
however, printers use cyan,
magenta, and yellow as the primary
color components, as illustrated in
Figure 2-15. This color model is
called the CMY model, for reasons I
just know you can figure out.
Because inks are impure, produc-
ing a true black by mixing just
cyan, magenta, and yellow is diffi-
cult. So high-end photo printers
and commercial printing presses
add black ink to the CMY mix. This
model is called CMYK (the K is
used to represent black because commercial printers refer to the black
printing plate as the Key plate). Four-color images printed at a commer-
cial printer may need to be converted to the CMYK color mode before
printing. (See Chapter 9 for more information on CMYK printing.)
One important note here: The colors you see in the RGB model in Figure
2-14 and the colors in the CMYK model in Figure 2-15 appear the same.
But in reality, the RGB colors are much more vibrant; what you’re seeing
in Figure 2-14 is the RGB chart converted to the CMYK model for print-
ing. You simply can’t reproduce in print the most vivid hues in an RGB
image, which is one reason why those colors you see on your monitor
never exactly match what you see in your printed photos. For more on
this issue, check out Chapter 9.
 Grayscale: A grayscale image is comprised solely of black, white, and
shades of gray. Some people (and some photo-editing programs) refer to
grayscale images as black-and-white images, but a true black-and-white
image contains only black and white pixels, with no shades of gray in
between. Graphics professionals often refer to black-and-white images
as line art.
Many digital cameras enable you to capture grayscale images. But I sug-
gest that you instead shoot in full color and then convert the color
photo to grayscale in your photo-editing program. You can always go
from color to grayscale after the fact, but you can’t do the opposite.
Check out Chapter 13 for the how-to’s on creating a grayscale image and
then adding a sepia tone to create the appearance of a hundred-year-old
photograph.
Figure 2-15: The print color model is based
on cyan, magenta, and yellow ink.

 CIE Lab, HSB, and HSL: These acronyms refer to three other color
models for digital images. Until you become an advanced digital-imaging
guru, you don’t need to worry about them. But just for the record, CIE
Lab defines colors using three color channels. One channel stores lumi-
nosity (brightness) values, and the other two channels each store a sep-
arate range of colors. (The a and b are arbitrary names assigned to
these two color channels.) HSB and HSL define colors based on hue
(color), saturation (purity or intensity of color), and brightness (in the
case of HSB) or lightness (in HSL).
About the only time you’re likely to run into these color options is when
mixing paint colors in an photo-editing program. Even then, the on-
screen display in the color-mixing dialog boxes makes it easy to figure
out how to create the color you want.

A
s soon as manufacturers figured out how to create digital cameras at
prices the mass market could swallow, the rush was on to jump on the
digital bandwagon. Today, everyone from icons of the photography world,
such as Kodak, Olympus, Nikon, Canon, and Fujifilm, to powerhouse players
in the consumer electronics market, such as Hewlett-Packard,
Sony, and Casio, offers a digital photography line.
Having so many fingers in the digicam pie is both good
and bad. More competition means better products, a
wider array of choices, and lower prices. On the
downside, you need to do more research to figure
out which camera is right for you. Different manu-
facturers take different approaches to winning the
consumer’s heart, and sorting through the options
can be confusing.
If you hate to make decisions, you may be hoping that
I can tell you which camera to pick. Unfortunately, I
can’t. Buying a camera is a very personal decision, and no
one camera suits every need. The camera that fits snugly
into one person’s hand may feel awkward in another’s. You may
enjoy a camera that has advanced photographic controls, while the
guy next door prefers a simple, entry-level model.

50
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
But even though I can’t guide you to a specific camera, I can help you deter-
mine which features you really need and which ones you can do without. I
can also provide you with a list of questions to ask as you’re evaluating differ-
ent models. As you’re about to find out, you need to consider a wide variety
of factors before you plunk down your money.
Mac or Windows — Does It Matter?
Here’s a relatively easy one. Most — not all, but most — digital cameras work
with both Macintosh and Windows-based PCs. By “work with,” I mean that
you can transfer pictures to the computer by cabling the camera directly to
the computer. Of course, if the camera stores pictures on removable memory
cards, you can buy a card reader and eliminate the need to connect camera
and computer altogether. (See the upcoming section “Memory Matters” for
more about this option.)
Nor do you need to worry that your Mac friends will have trouble opening
your digital photos if you work on a PC, or vice versa. Today’s cameras store
images in formats that are compatible with both platforms. And you can buy
good photo-editing programs for both, too, although the choices for
Macintosh software are more limited than on the Windows side. (Visit
Chapter 4 for tips on choosing software.)
Be sure to check out the computer-system requirements on the camera box
before you buy, however. You may need to upgrade to the latest operating
system or install more memory (RAM) to run the camera software. I suggest
that you have at least 256MB of RAM; the more, the merrier.
Picture Quality Options
As with a film camera, the sophistication of the lens, focusing, and exposure
systems all play a role in digital picture quality. But three digital-only features
also have an impact: resolution (pixel count), file format, and ISO setting.
The next two sections offer advice for finding a camera that offers the appro-
priate resolution and file format options for the type of photography you
want to do. The section “Exposure Exposed,” later in this chapter, talks about
ISO options.
Note that on many cameras, you adjust resolution and file format via a single
control, with settings that have generic names such as “Good, Better, Best” or
“Fine, Basic, Normal.” Cameras that offer separate controls for these two pic-
ture settings offer the most flexibility, of course, but most casual users won’t
miss having the independent controls.

You say you want a resolution
Chapter 2 provides the full story on resolution, but here’s a quick recap:
Camera resolution refers to the number of pixels that a camera can capture.
Pixels are the square “tiles” of color that comprise all digital images.
Camera resolution is usually stated in terms of megapixels. Megapixel means
1 million pixels. A 2-megapixel camera offers 2 million pixels, a 3-megapixel
camera offers 3 million pixels, and so on.
In years past, megapixels were the leading sales attraction. Thanks to adver-
tising that emphasized this camera feature, consumers quickly learned that
they should covet more pixels, even if they weren’t quite sure why. 
Megapixels were a critical consideration when resolution offerings varied from
less than a megapixel to 3 megapixels. You need at least a 1-megapixel image
to print good snapshots, more for 5-x-7-inch prints or larger. And until recently,
you had to buy at the top of the camera line to get that higher resolution.
Today, however, most cameras offer at least 3 megapixels — even sub-$100
models. Because 3 megapixels are enough to generate 8-x-10-inch prints, the
megapixel competition is much less heated than it used to be, although
camera cost is still somewhat tied to the megapixel count.
Does that mean you’re wasting your money if you pony up for more than 3
megapixels? Not necessarily. How many megapixels are appropriate depends
on how you like to use your photos. The following list offers some guidance:
 VGA resolution (640 x 480 pixels): If all you want to do with your
photos is share them via e-mail, post them on a Web page, or use them
in a multimedia presentation, you can get by with a VGA-resolution
camera. But as for print quality, you’re going to be disappointed. Again,
see Chapter 2 if you’re not sure how resolution affects print quality. 
 One megapixel: With a 1-megapixel model, you can print acceptable
snapshots. You also get plenty of pixels for any on-screen picture use.
 Two megapixels: With 2 megapixels, you can produce very good 5 x 7-
inch prints and acceptable 8 x 10s.
 Three megapixels: With this many pixels, you can generate good 8 x 10s.
 Four megapixels and up: If you like to produce prints that are larger
than 8 x 10, go for 4 megapixels or more.
Additional pixels also give you the flexibility to crop your pictures and then
print the remaining image at a decent size. For example, getting close-ups of
zoo inhabitants is pretty tough unless you have a super-long zoom lens. The
left image in Figure 3-1 shows the tightest shot I could manage of a resident at
51

52
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
our local zoo. Fortunately, my camera offered a resolution high enough to
allow me to crop out the excess background in my photo software and pro-
duce the tighter composition you see on the right.
If you do go the mega-megapixel route, find out whether the camera also
offers you the flexibility of shooting at a lower resolution. Why? Because
more pixels increase the amount of storage space you need to hold your pic-
ture files. Also, the image capture time at a higher resolution setting can be
longer because the camera needs more time to capture all those added
pixels. The best cameras offer a choice of two or three resolution settings, so
that you can vary the pixel count depending on your available memory and
the pace at which you want to snap off shots.
Bottom line: Unless you’re interested in making very large prints or doing a
lot of close cropping, 4 megapixels is plenty, and you’ll likely be happy with
only 3. So instead of paying a premium for the highest megapixel count on
the market, put your money into a longer zoom lens, a good photo printer, or
other accessories.
Figure 3-1: When you start out with more megapixels (left), you can crop your photos and still have enough
pixels left to produce a quality print (right).

File format flexibility
Pixel count is an important factor in digital photo quality. But the file format
you use to record your pictures also plays a key role. File format refers to the
way that computer data is stored within the file.
Scads of formats exist, with a dozen or so created expressly for handling digi-
tal imagery and graphics. Digital cameras, however, rely on a trio of formats:
JPEG, TIFF, and Camera Raw, or Raw, for short.
Chapter 5 provides full coverage of these formats, but here’s a brief introduction:
 JPEG (jay-peg): This format is the standard for digital-camera images.
All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display JPEG photos, which
means that you can go straight from the camera to the online world.
JPEG has a disadvantage, though: When JPEG files are created, they’re
compressed, a process that throws away some image data in order to
shrink file sizes.
Smaller files are great, allowing you to fit more pictures on a camera
memory card and reducing the time required to share images online. But
although a small amount of compression does little noticeable damage, a
high degree of compression seriously degrades picture quality.
53
Chapter 3: In Search of the Perfect Camera
The war between CCD and CMOS
Image-sensor chips — the chips that capture the
image in digital cameras — fall into two main
camps: CCD, or charge-coupled device, and
CMOS (pronounced see-moss), which stands
for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor.
The main argument in favor of CCD chips is that
they’re more sensitive than CMOS chips, so you
can get better images in dim lighting. CCD chips
also tend to deliver cleaner images than CMOS
chips, which sometimes have a problem with
noise — small defects in the image.
On the other hand, CMOS chips are less expen-
sive to manufacture, and that cost savings
translates into lower camera prices. In addition,
CMOS chips are less power-hungry than CCD
chips, so you can shoot for longer periods of
time before replacing the camera’s batteries.
CMOS chips also perform better than CCD chips
when capturing highlights, such as the sparkle of
jewelry or the glint of sunlight reflecting across a
lake. CCD chips can suffer from blooming, which
means creating unwanted halos around very
bright highlights, while CMOS sensors do not.
Currently, an overwhelming number of cameras
use CCD technology. But camera manufactur-
ers are working to refine CMOS technology, and
when they do, you can expect to hear more
about this type of camera.

54
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
 TIFF (tiff, as in argument): Unlike JPEG, this format retains all critical
image data. That means the best possible image quality, but also files that
are significantly larger than JPEG files. And you can’t share TIFF files online
without first opening them in a photo editor and converting them to JPEG.
 Camera Raw (or just Raw): When you shoot in the JPEG or TIFF format,
the camera does some post-capture processing to refine color, contrast,
and other picture qualities. In the Raw format, none of these changes are
applied. You get uncooked, “raw” data right from the image sensor.
This format is designed for photographers who want to control whether
and how any tweaking is done to the image-sensor data, in the same way
that some film experts like to develop and print their own negatives.
Because no compression is applied, Raw files are larger than JPEG files.
More important, you must use a special piece of software called a Raw
converter to tell your computer how to translate all the raw data into a
digital picture.
Note that some manufacturers give Raw files a proprietary label. For
example, Nikon Raw files are called NEF files.
To help you better understand the impact of format on picture quality,
Figures 3-2 and 3-3 show you the difference between an uncompressed TIFF
image, a lightly compressed JPEG (see Figure 3-2), and a highly compressed
JPEG (see Figure 3-3). Differences between the uncompressed TIFF and lightly
compressed JPEG are hard to spot, especially in the larger versions of the
image. But the negative impact of excessive compression is clear — not only
does the picture take on a blocky look, but also exhibits random color
defects, known in the trade as color artifacts or color fringing.
Figure 3-2: Only upon close inspection can you see much visual difference between an uncompressed TIFF
image (left) and a lightly compressed JPEG image (right).

If you’ve visited Chapters 2 or 5,
you’ll recognize the subject in
Figures 3-2 and 3-3 as the same
one used in those chapters to
illustrate the impact of pixel count
on a photo. For Figures 3-2 and 3-3,
all three images contain the same
number of pixels; the only differ-
ence is the file format. You can see
that extensive compression is just
as detrimental as having too few
pixels. Combine low resolution
with lots of compression, and the
result is a picture that really stinks.
Cameras that enable you to
choose from all three file formats
offer the best of all worlds, of
course. Even better, some cam-
eras offer a JPEG+Raw or JPEG+
TIFF option, which creates two
versions of each picture: one in the JPEG format, for easy online sharing, and
one in the TIFF or Raw format.
That said, unless you’re a very demanding photographer and have the time and
inclination to “process” your Raw files (a topic you can explore in Chapter 8),
JPEG alone is just fine — add points for TIFF or Raw, but don’t dismiss cameras
that don’t offer them. Just be sure that your camera offers a JPEG setting that
applies minimum compression for times when picture quality is paramount.
In most cases, these compression
settings go by vague names, such
as Fine, Normal, and Basic. For
example, Figure 3-4 shows the set-
ting options on a Nikon camera
that offers three JPEG quality
options along with Raw and
Raw+JPEG. In this case, the Fine,
Normal, and Basic labels define
compression, with Fine applying
the least compression (for Fine
picture quality).
Again, though, some manufactur-
ers assign these same types of
names to settings that either con-
trol the number of image pixels or control both resolution and file format
together. So be sure that you know what option you’re evaluating; check the
camera manual for this information. Because analyzing image quality at all

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
the different settings is difficult to do just by looking at the camera monitor,
reading the in-depth reviews published in print and online camera magazines
pays off. (Chapter 16 points you toward some good online resources.) 
Memory Matters
In a film camera, the film negative holds the picture information. In a digital
camera, the picture data is stored in the camera memory, which you can
think of as an electronic storage tank.
A few cameras have built-in memory (if you want to be hip, call it on-board
memory). But most cameras now rely on removable memory cards or disks,
sometimes referred to as digital film. You put a memory card or disk into a
slot on the camera, as shown in Figure 3-5, just as you put a floppy disk into
your computer or a videotape into your VCR.
Figure 3-5: Most cameras store images on memory cards such as 
xD-Picture Card shown here.
For a look at some common types of removable camera memory, see Figure
3-6. I included the floppy disk primarily to give you an idea of the size of the
other cards. With the advent of smaller, higher capacity options, floppy disks
became dinosaurs in the memory game and only a few Sony cameras use
them now.

Figure 3-6: Digital cameras store pictures on a variety of removable media.
Again, almost all new cameras either provide a memory-card slot or give you
the option of using on-board memory or removable media. But if you’re con-
sidering a cardless model, keep these points in mind: 
 When you fill up on-board memory, you have to stop shooting and either
delete or download your photo files before you can take more pictures.
After you fill up a memory card, though, you just take it out of the
camera, insert another card, and keep shooting. Or you can buy a single,
large-capacity card; most cameras accept cards that offer far more stor-
age than is usually provided in on-board memory.
 When you download images to your computer, the transfer process is
inconvenient if your camera offers only on-board storage. You have to
cable together the camera and the computer, which often means crawl-
ing around the back of the computer looking for the right place to plug
in the cable.
With removable media, downloading images is painless. You can buy a
card reader or adapter that enables your computer to see the memory
card as simply another drive on your computer. When you want to
download, you just take the card out of the camera, pop it into the
reader or adapter, and move the files to the computer just as you move
files from a floppy disk or CD.

 You can also print directly from media cards, either by using a printer
that offers memory-card slots or taking your card into a photo lab for
printing. Some printers do allow you to connect some cameras, via
cable, for direct printing, but not all printer/camera combos offer this
feature. 
 Other electronics devices, such as some MP3 players, also store content
on removable memory cards. So you may be able to get double duty
from your memory cards. 
As you can tell, I’m not a fan of cameras that offer only on-board memory.
This is especially true if you’re a parent buying a first camera for a young
photographer who needs supervision to use the computer. Trust me, you
don’t want the hassle of firing up the computer, digging out the camera cable,
and transferring pictures every half hour — which is about how long the
average preteen takes to fill the typical amount of on-board storage. I empha-
size this point because cameras marketed to this age group tend to be the
ones that lack the removable memory option.
One last point about memory, whether on-board or removable: When com-
paring cameras, look closely at the manufacturer’s “maximum storage capac-
ity” claims — the maximum number of images you can store in the available
memory. The figure you see reflects the number of images you can store if
you set the camera to capture the fewest number of pixels or apply the high-
est level of JPEG compression, or both. So if Camera A can store more pic-
tures than Camera B, and both cameras offer the same amount of memory,
Camera A’s images must either contain fewer pixels or be more highly com-
pressed than Camera B’s images. (See the JPEG information in the preceding
section for more details about compression.)
Monitor, Viewfinder, or Both?
Most cameras have an LCD (liquid-crystal display) monitor to allow you to
view the images stored in the camera, as shown in Figure 3-7. The LCD also
displays menus that you use to change camera settings and delete images.
The ability to review and delete images right on the camera is one of the
biggest benefits of digital photography. If an image doesn’t come out the way
you wanted, you erase it and try again. And of course, you enjoy the advan-
tage of knowing that you captured the picture before you leave the scene or
put away your camera.
On most cameras, the monitor can also provide a preview of your shot. In
fact, some cameras lack a traditional viewfinder — the little window you look
through to compose pictures when using a film camera — so you must frame
your shots using the LCD monitor. Manufacturers omit the viewfinder either

to lower the cost of the camera or to allow a nontraditional camera design. I
find it difficult to shoot pictures using only the monitor because you have to
hold the camera a few inches away in order to see what you’re shooting. If
your hands aren’t that steady, taking a picture without moving the camera
can be tricky. When looking through the viewfinder, however, you can brace
the camera against your face. Additionally, monitors tend to wash out in
bright light, making it hard to see what you’re shooting. 
Figure 3-7: The LCD monitor enables you to review images immediately 
after you press the shutter button.
Clearly, though, many buyers are happy with having a monitor alone, or
the camera makers wouldn’t keep producing this style of camera. And I
will say that monitors on the newest cameras are greatly improved, offering
displays that are larger and better designed for bright-light viewing than in
the past.
If you decide to go without a viewfinder, look for a camera that offers a fea-
ture designed to eliminate the blurring that can be caused by small camera
movements. Depending on the manufacturer, this feature may be called anti-
shake, image stabilization, or something similar. Also ask to try the camera
outside in the sun to be sure that the picture on the monitor is easily view-
able. Some cameras, like the Konica Minolta model shown in Figure 3-8, offer
a monitor that swivels to allow for a better viewing angle; this feature is a def-
inite plus.

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
On the other hand, if you decide that
a viewfinder is critical, take a look at
both traditional viewfinders — some-
times called optical viewfinders — and
electronic viewfinders. Often referred
to as an EVF, an electronic viewfinder
is actually a tiny microdisplay, much
like the monitor itself. The electronic
viewfinder displays the same image
that the camera lens sees, so you can
shoot without worrying about paral-
lax errors, a phenomenon that can
occur with some optical viewfinders.
(Chapter 7 has details.) However,
some people (including me) don’t like
most electronic viewfinders because
the display is less sharp than what
you see through an optical viewfinder. Also, you usually can’t see anything
through the viewfinder until you turn the camera on, which means that you
can’t set up your shots without using up battery life.
SLR or Point-and-Shoot?
The majority of digital cameras are automatic, point-and-shoot models. They
offer convenience and ease of use, providing autofocus, autoexposure, and
auto just-about-everything else. But photographers who are used to working
with a film SLR (single-lens reflex) camera or simply want to take more con-
trol over the picture-taking process may want to splurge on a digital SLR.
Most major names in film photography, including Nikon, Canon, Minolta, and
Olympus, offer digital SLRs for the consumer market. Some models, like the
Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D and Canon Digital Rebel XT, shown in the top row
of Figure 3-9, look very much like their film counterparts; others, like the
Olympus Evolt shown in the lower left part of the figure, take advantage of
nontraditional design options made possible by digital technology. (To see
Nikon’s digital SLR, flip back to Figure 1-1, in Chapter 1.) 
Digital SLRs provide the same range of features as film SLRs, including inter-
changeable lenses, manual focus and exposure controls, and connections for
an external flash. And these cameras give you the best of two worlds: When
you prefer to concentrate on picture composition, you can put the camera
into fully automatic mode and let it handle exposure and focus decisions.

Figure 3-8: Some monitors swivel to provide a
choice of viewing angles.

Figure 3-9: A look at digital SLRs from Canon, Minolta, and Olympus, plus a 
rangefinder model from Epson.
Of course, you pay more for this flexibility: The least expensive models start
at about $700, and that buys just the camera body. You have to pony up more
for the lens, just as when you invest in a film SLR.
Prefer rangefinder cameras to SLRs? You, too, can go digital, but expect to dig
even deeper into your wallet. The Epson R-D1, shown in the lower-right corner
of Figure 3-9, is priced at just under $3,000 — again, for the body only.
If you already have lenses, you may be able to use them with a digital body.
But because of the differences between film and digital technology, a film lens
produces a longer apparent focal length when used with a digital camera. The
discrepancy varies from camera to camera; look for a spec called multiplica-
tion factor or cropping factor and then multiply that number by your lens focal
length to find out how much increase to expect. For example, if the camera
has a multiplication factor of 1.5, a 50mm lens on a film camera behaves like a
75mm lens on a digital camera. (For a detailed explanation of focal length, see
the upcoming section “Fun facts about focal length.”)

To make sure that you get expert advice in selecting a body and lens combi-
nation, I urge you to buy from a reputable camera store. I give this advice to
people buying point-and-shoot cameras, too, but it’s doubly important for
SLR and rangefinder purchases because of the lens issues and larger financial
investment.
Hybrid Cameras
As you shop, you’ll encounter some devices that are part digital-still camera —
that is, cameras that take still pictures, as opposed to movies — and part
something else. Here’s my take on the most common of these hybrids: 
 Webcams: Sold for as little as $30, Webcams are simple video cameras
designed for video conferencing and Internet telephony (making phone
calls over the Internet). You sit in front of the camera, and the camera
sends your image to your adoring online audience.
Some Webcams can be untethered from the computer and used as a
stand-alone camera. But most offer limited resolution — usually, 1
megapixel or less — and lack a monitor for reviewing your pictures. You
may or may not be able to use removable memory. For these reasons,
Webcams are best for people who have limited interest in or need for
still photography.
 Digital video cameras: Show up with one of
these devices and you’ll be the envy of all the
parents lugging traditional camcorders.
However, when it comes to photos, don’t expect
the same quality that you get from a digital-still
camera. In the same way, many digital-still cam-
eras can record short movie clips but don’t offer
all the functions you expect from a video
camera.
That said, the convergence of the two technolo-
gies has gotten much better, so if you’re as much
interested in digital video as digital photography,
do experiment with the combo models — you
may find one that straddles both technologies
well. You may also want to consider a product
like the Concord DVx, shown in Figure 3-10.
This model records MPEG-4 movies, can take 2
megapixel still pictures, and can even play MP3
music files.
A good portion of this book applies to still pic-
tures taken with a digital video camera, but for help with the video side
of things, you may want to pick up a copy of Digital Video For Dummies,
3rd Edition, by Keith Underdahl (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

 Camera phones: The newest addition to cellphone
design is the built-in digital camera. After you snap a
picture, you can attach it to an e-mail message that you
send right from your phone. Or, if the recipient also has
a camera phone, you can send the image to that phone.
Depending on your service provider, you can also send
the image from your phone to an online sharing site or
printer. Some camera phones, including the Sanyo model
shown in Figure 3-11, even have slots for removable
memory cards.
Sending pictures via phone is fun and, perhaps more
important, useful for communicating visual information
quickly and conveniently. For example, a real-estate
agent can snap and send an image of a hot new listing
to a prospective client. But don’t expect your phone to
be a whole lot better at taking pictures than a camera is
at making telephone calls. Even with phones that can
take 1-megapixel stills, the picture quality is usually
suspect; remember, a lot more goes into good images
than pixels.
Flash Fundamentals
Film or digital, photography requires light. A flash is the most convenient
way to provide the needed light for indoor or nighttime pictures. A flash can
be handy when taking daytime pictures outdoors, too. You can use the flash
to compensate for backlighting or to light a subject standing in the shade.
Most digital cameras now offer a built-in flash, but the array of flash-related
options varies. The following list explains the most common flash features:
 Basic flash controls: Usually, you get at least three flash settings: auto-
matic (the flash fires only when the camera thinks the light is too low);
fill flash (the flash fires no matter what); and no flash. If the camera has
an automatic flash, you definitely want the other two modes as well so
that you, and not the camera, ultimately control whether the flash fires.
 Red-eye reduction: Most cameras also offer a red-eye reduction mode,
which is designed to reduce the problem of a flash-induced red glint to
subjects’ eyes. I’m not too worried about this option because it usually
doesn’t work that well and you can always cover up red-eye in your
photo software. See Chapter 13 for details.
 Advanced flash features: Higher-end cameras usually add slow sync
mode, which produces brighter backgrounds in dim lighting than stan-
dard flash. Some cameras also enable you to raise or lower the intensity
of the flash slightly, which can be helpful in tricky lighting situations.
Give extra points to cameras offering these options.

 External flash connection: With
SLRs and some high-end point-and-
shoot models, you can add an exter-
nal flash unit, either via a hot shoe
connection (shown in Figure 3-12) or
a flash cable. These options are
attractive to professionals and
advanced hobbyists, but casual pho-
tographers can get by without them.
Note that if your camera doesn’t
offer an external flash connection,
you can always use a slave flash,
which is a stand-alone flash that
fires when it “sees” your on-board
flash go off. 
For tips on flash photography, see
Chapter 6.
Through a Lens, Clearly
When shopping for a digital camera, many people get so caught up in the details
of resolution, compression, and other digital options that they forget to think
about some of the more basic, but just as essential, camera features. The lens
is one of those components that is often overlooked — and shouldn’t be.
Serving as your camera’s “eye,” the lens determines what your camera can
see — and how well that view is transmitted to the CCD or CMOS chip for
recording. The following sections explain some of the lens details to consider
as you evaluate different cameras.
Fun facts about focal length
Different lenses have different focal lengths. On film cameras, focal length is 
a measurement of the distance between the center of the lens and the film. 
On a digital camera, focal length measures the distance between the lens 
and the image sensor. For both types of cameras, focal length is measured in
millimeters.
Don’t get bogged down in the scientific gobbledygook, though. Just focus —
yuk, yuk — on the following focal length facts:
Hot shoe
Built-in flash

Figure 3-12: A hot shoe enables you to
attach an external flash unit.

 Focal length determines the lens’s angle of view and the size at which
your subject appears in the frame:
• Wide-angle: Lenses with short focal lengths are known as wide-
angle lenses. A short focal length has the visual effect of “pushing”
the subject away from you and making it appear smaller. As a
result, you can fit more of the scene into the frame without moving
back.
• Telephoto: Lenses with long focal lengths are called telephoto
lenses. A long focal length seems to bring the subject closer to you
and increases the subject’s size in the frame.
• “Normal”: On most point-and-shoot cameras, a focal length in the
neighborhood of 35mm is considered a “normal” lens — that is,
somewhere between a wide-angle and a telephoto. This focal
length is appropriate for the kinds of snapshots most people take.
 Cameras that offer a zoom lens enable you to vary focal length. As you
zoom in, the focal length increases; as you zoom out, it decreases.
 A few cameras offer dual lenses, which usually provide a standard, 
snapshot-oriented focal length plus a telephoto focal length. In addition,
some cameras have macro modes, which permit close-up photography.
Dual-lens cameras are different from zoom lens cameras, which offer the
ability to shoot at any focal length along the zoom range. For example, a
38–110mm zoom can be placed at any focal length between its maximum
and minimum settings: 38mm, 50mm, 70mm, and so on. A dual-lens
38mm/70mm camera has only the two focal-length settings.
 To get a visual perspective on focal length, take a look at Figure 3-13.
Here, you see the same scene captured at four different focal lengths.
As the focal length increases, the lens can capture less and less of the
landscape.
 Note that the focal lengths I mention here aren’t the true numbers for
these cameras. Rather, they indicate the equivalent focal length provided
by a lens on a 35mm-format film camera. Because of the way digital cam-
eras are designed, the actual focal lengths don’t really provide any
useful information for the photographer. So manufacturers provide a
“lens equivalency” number. Advertisements and spec sheets for cameras
include lens statements such as “5mm lens, equivalent to 35mm lens on
a 35mm-format camera.”
This book takes the equivalency approach as well. So if I mention a lens
focal length, I’m using the equivalent value.

Figure 3-13: Focal length determines how much of a scene a lens can capture and how large subjects
appear in the frame. 
Now that you understand what those little lens numbers mean on the digital
camera boxes, you can choose a camera that offers a lens appropriate for the
kind of shooting you plan to do. Again, a standard, 35mm (equivalent) lens is
good for taking ordinary snapshots. If you want to do a lot of landscape
shooting, you may want to look for a slightly shorter focal length because
that enables you to capture a larger field of view. A wide-angle lens is also
helpful for shooting in small rooms; with a standard 35mm, you may not be
able to get far enough away from your subject to fit it in the frame.
Some wide-angle lenses cause a problem known as convergence, a distortion
that makes vertical structures appear to lean toward the center of the frame.
If you plan to do a lot of wide-angle shooting, be sure to take some test pic-
tures to check for this issue before buying a camera.

Optical versus digital zoom
As the preceding section explains, zoom lenses give you a closer view of far-
away subjects. A zoom lens is especially great for travel photography and is
also good for portraits or still-life shots in which you want to shoot a subject
without including a large amount of background. (Chapter 7 illustrates this
technique.)
If a zoom lens is important to you, be sure that the camera you buy has an
optical zoom. An optical zoom is a true zoom lens. Some cameras instead
offer a digital zoom, which is nothing more than some in-camera image proc-
essing. When you use a digital zoom, the camera enlarges the image area at
the center of the frame and trims away the outside edges of the picture. The
result is the same as when you open an image in your photo-editing program,
crop away the edges of the picture, and then enlarge the remaining portion of
the photo. Enlarging the “zoomed” area reduces the image resolution and the
image quality.
For a better understanding of resolution, see Chapter 2; for more information
about digital and optical zooms, see Chapter 7.
Focusing aids
Some cameras have fixed-focus lenses, which means that the point of focus is
unchangeable. Usually, this type of lens is engineered so that images appear
in sharp focus from a few feet in front of the camera to infinity.
Many cameras enable you to adjust the focus point for three different dis-
tances. Among the settings are macro mode for extreme close-ups, portrait
mode for subjects a dozen feet from the camera, and landscape mode for dis-
tant subjects.
Different cameras offer different focus ranges, which is probably most impor-
tant in the area of close-up photography. Some cameras enable you to get
very near your subject, but other cameras are a bit limiting in this regard. If
you want to do a lot of close-up work, check the minimum subject-to-camera
distance of a camera before you buy. Also note that because of the short
focal lengths of their lenses, digital cameras typically offer extreme depth of
field, which means that the zones of sharp focus are far greater than with a
film camera.
Cameras with autofocus automatically adjust the focus depending on the dis-
tance of the subject from the lens. Most cameras with autofocus abilities
offer a very useful feature called focus lock. You can use this feature to spec-
ify exactly which object you want the camera to focus on, regardless of the
object’s position in the frame. Usually, you center the subject in the
viewfinder, press the shutter button halfway down to lock the focus, reframe,
and then snap the picture.

Chapter 3: In Search of the Perfect Camera

68
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
Digital SLRs and a few high-end point-and-shoot models offer the option to
switch from automatic to manual focusing, giving you complete control over
the focus range. On SLRs, you adjust focus by twisting a manual focus ring on
the lens barrel, just as with a film SLR. On the point-and-shoot models, you
usually set the focus point a specific distance from the camera — 12 inches, 
3 feet, and so on — via a menu that’s displayed on the LCD monitor.
However you implement it, manual focus is a desirable option even for those
whose photographic interests aren’t advanced enough to demand it.
Sometimes, autofocusing mechanisms have trouble getting the focus right
when you’re shooting a complex scene. If you’re taking a picture of a tiger in
a cage, for example, the autofocus may lock onto the cage instead of the tiger.
Setting the focus yourself may be the only way to make sure that the subject
is in sharp focus.
For more insights about focus, see Chapter 6.
Lens adaptability
Digital SLRs allow you the same lens flexibility you get with film SLRs. You
also can add color and effects filters, just as you can with film models.
If you’re a serious photography buff but not ready to invest in a digital SLR,
you may want to buy a point-and-shoot model that accepts lens adapters and
filters. Many cameras now sport lens designs that enable you to screw on
wide-angle, fish-eye, or close-up lens adapters. Several third-party companies
also offer adapters and filters for popular cameras.
You also can attach color filters, such as a warming or cooling filter, to some
point-and-shoot lenses. However, such filters may be unnecessary because
you can create some of the effects that they produce by changing the white
balance setting. (See Chapter 5 for details.) You also can mimic the look of
many traditional filters by applying special effects in a photo editor. About
the only filter effect you can’t reliably re-create in a photo editor is the glare-
reduction properties of a polarizing filter.
Exposure Exposed
As Chapter 2 explains, image exposure is affected by shutter speed, aperture,
and ISO. Chapter 6 provides a thorough explanation of how to manipulate
exposure, but how much flexibility you have in that department depends on
your camera’s exposure controls. So here’s a quick rundown of what to make
of the exposure-control specs you may encounter when you shop for cameras:

 Programmed autoexposure is fully automatic exposure. The camera
selects both the proper aperture and shutter speed for you.
 Aperture-priority autoexposure means that you select the aperture,
and the camera sets the appropriate shutter speed. The most common
use for this setting is to shift depth of field (the zone of sharp focus). On
low-priced cameras, you typically get only two aperture settings: one for
dim light and another for bright light. Higher-end cameras offer a larger
range of apertures.
 Shutter-priority autoexposure means that you select the shutter speed,
and the camera chooses the aperture. This feature is helpful for captur-
ing moving subjects; the shutter speed selected by the programmed
autoexposure may not be quick
enough to “stop the action.”
 Manual exposure allows you to set
both shutter speed and aperture.
The range of shutter speeds and
aperture settings depends on the
camera.
 EV compensation enables you to
increase or decrease the exposure
setting chosen by the automatic
exposure mechanism. This control
is very helpful and, thankfully, pro-
vided on most cameras.
 Automatic bracketing captures a
series of shots, each at a different
exposure, with one press of the
shutter button. For example, I shot
the images in Figure 3-14 using this
feature. Many photographers rou-
tinely shoot the same scene at dif-
ferent exposures — called
bracketing the shot — to make sure
that they get a least one image
with an exposure that’s correct.
Some people also combine the
darkest exposure and lightest
exposure in a photo editor to
achieve an image that has better
detail in both the shadows and
highlights than you can get from a
single exposure.

exposure settings, with one press of the

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
 Metering modes determine how the camera evaluates the available light
when determining the correct exposure:
• Spot metering sets the exposure based on the center of the frame
only.
• Center-weighted metering reads the light in the entire frame but
gives more importance to the center of the frame.
• Matrix or multizone metering reads the light throughout the
entire frame and chooses an exposure that does the best job of
capturing both the brightest and darkest regions of the picture.
Lower-priced cameras typically provide only the last metering mode,
which works well for everyday pictures. More advanced cameras add
the first two modes, which are helpful for shooting in tricky light.
 Scene modes are special shooting modes that automatically select an
aperture and shutter speed that’s appropriate for specific shooting con-
ditions. For example, portrait mode is designed for taking people shots,
while sports mode is geared to action photography. This feature is great
for photographers who want creative flexibility without spending more
money for a camera that offers manual exposure controls.
 ISO affects the camera’s sensitivity to light. Newer digital cameras may
offer a wide range of ISO settings. The higher the ISO, the less light is
required to capture the image. But a higher ISO also usually results in a
grainy or “noisy” image. This problem is hard to detect when looking at
the camera monitor; you need to read reviews to find out how the
camera you’re considering performs at each of its available ISO settings.
Until you know that you can produce good images at the highest set-
tings, don’t pay more for that extended ISO range.
Discount-store bargains — really a good buy?
You’re cruising through the aisles of your neigh-
borhood discount store. Just past the table of
slightly imperfect waterbed sheets and the rack
of 24-roll, megasaver toilet-paper packages,
you spot a display of digital cameras. Wow!
Digital cameras at deep discounts? Is this your
lucky day? Or are you looking at a deal that’s too
good to be true? Maybe . . . maybe not.
Although you can get a good buy at deep-discount
stores, you need to shop armed with plenty of
data to be sure that you get a real bargain. Off-
price stores and even major electronics chains
often feature last year’s cameras. Although
these cameras may be just fine from a quality
and performance standpoint, they don’t usually
represent the best price/feature ratio, even
when they’re sold at a huge discount to the orig-
inal retail prices.
Each year, manufacturers refine production
processes to develop better, cheaper digital
cameras. Most vendors also manufacture digi-
tal cameras in greater quantities now than in
past years, which has lowered the per-unit cost
even further. As a result, you may get more fea-
tures for the same or less money if you opt for
the manufacturer’s newest model.

Still More Features to Consider
The preceding sections cover the major features to evaluate when you’re
camera shopping. Explore the rest of this chapter to discover some addi-
tional options that may also be important to you, depending upon the kind of
photography you want to do.
Now playing, on your big-screen TV
Many cameras offer video-out capabilities. Translated into plain English, this
means that you can connect your camera to your television and display your
pictures on the TV screen, as shown in Figure 3-15, or record the images on
your VCR.
Figure 3-15: You can connect some cameras to a TV for picture 
playback.
When might you use such a feature? One scenario is when you want to show
your pictures to a group of people — such as at a seminar or family gather-
ing. Let’s face it, most people aren’t going to put up with crowding around
your 15-inch computer monitor for very long, no matter how terrific your
images are.
You may sometimes hear video-out called NTSC output. NTSC, which stands
for National Television Standards Committee, refers to the standard format
used to generate TV pictures in North America. Europe and some other parts
of the world go by a different standard, known as PAL, an acronym for phase
alteration line-rate. You can’t display NTSC images on a PAL system.
71
Chapter 3: In Search of the Perfect Camera

72
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
Keep in mind that while video output is a cool feature, you can also buy
stand-alone playback devices for viewing pictures from a memory card.
Chapter 10 offers a look at one such product. Some DVD players even sport
memory-card slots.
In addition to video input/output options, some cameras enable you to
record audio clips along with your images. So when you play back your
image, you can actually hear your subjects shouting “Cheese!” as their happy
mugs appear on-screen.
Self-timer and remote control
Many cameras offer a self-timer mechanism. Just in case you haven’t had
experience with this particular option, a self-timer enables the photographer
to be part of the picture. You press the shutter button, run into the camera’s
field of view, and after a few seconds, the picture is snapped automatically.
A few cameras take the self-timer concept one step further and provide a
remote control unit that you can use to trigger the shutter button while
standing a few feet away from the camera.
There’s a computer in that camera!
All digital cameras include some computer-like components — chips that
enable them to capture and store images, for example. But some of the newer
models have bigger “brains” that enable them to perform some interesting
functions that otherwise require a full-fledged computer. Here are some fea-
tures you can find on such cameras, which some pundits have described as
camputers:
 Time-lapse photography: Some cameras provide a time-lapse shooting
option that tells the camera to take a picture automatically at specified
intervals. If you need to take pictures of events that occur over a long
period of time — a flower opening and closing its blooms, for example —
look for this feature.
 On-board image correction: Many cameras enable you to perform basic
image correction without ever downloading pictures to your computer.
You can apply sharpening and color correction, for example. Usually, you
select the correction options before you snap the picture, and the correc-
tions are applied as the image is saved to memory. Some cameras also
offer red-eye removal, which you can apply after reviewing a picture.
I’m not a big fan of this feature because you don’t get the same kind of
control over the correction as you do when fixing images yourself using
even a basic image editor. But on-board editing can come in handy if you

use a printer that can print directly from your camera or removable
memory card. The on-board processing can improve print quality in this
scenario. And some of the in-camera red-eye removal filters that I’ve
seen do work pretty well, although you should test this feature for your-
self. Sometimes, these filters can be pretty clumsy.
 PictBridge: This technology enables digital cameras and photo printers
to communicate. If your camera offers this technology, you can connect
it to any PictBridge-enabled printer, even if the camera and printer are
from different manufacturers. Then you can print your pictures without
using a computer as a middleman.
 DPOF: Another printing-related specification, DPOF (dee-poff), indicates
that you can set up a print job through the camera’s menus and also tag
images for later printing. Cameras that offer DPOF technology don’t
always include PictBridge, however.
As an alternative to connecting your camera to your printer, you can buy
a printer that can print from memory cards. You also can simply take
your memory cards to most any retail photo lab or even your corner
drugstore for printing. Chapter 9 discusses printing options in more
detail.
Action-oriented options
Shooting action with digital cameras can be difficult because most cameras
need a few seconds between shots to process an image and store it in
memory. Some newer cameras have been engineered to enable more rapid
shooting, however. If action photography is important to you, I recommend
visiting the manufacturer Web sites to find out which of their models are
geared to fast shooting.
Some cameras also offer a continuous-capture mode, often referred to as burst
mode. With this feature, you can record a series of images with one press of
the shutter button. The camera waits until after you release the shutter
button to perform most of the image-processing and storage functions, so lag
time is reduced.
Note that I said reduced, not eliminated. You can usually shoot a maximum of
two or three frames per second. That’s a fast capture rate, but it’s still not quick
enough to catch every moving target. See Chapter 7 for more information.
As an alternative action-shot feature, some cameras enable you to record a
“mini movie” in a digital video format, such as MPEG. You can capture images
and sounds for a short period of time and then play the moving images on
your TV or on any computer that has software for opening and playing the
movie files.

Little things that mean a lot
When you’re shopping for digital cameras, you can sometimes focus so much
on the big picture (no pun intended) that you overlook the details. The fol-
lowing list presents some features that may not seem like a big deal in the
store, but can really frustrate you after you get the camera home:
 Batteries: Thinking about batteries may seem like a trivial matter, but
trust me, this issue becomes more and more important as you shoot
more and more pictures. On some cameras, you can suck the life out of a
set of batteries in less than an hour of shooting, even quicker if you keep
the LCD monitor turned on.
Some cameras can accept AA lithium batteries, which have about three
times the life of a standard AA alkaline battery — and cost twice as much.
Other cameras use rechargeable NiCad or NiMH batteries or 3-volt lithium
batteries, and others can accept only regular AA alkaline batteries.
Be sure to ask which types of batteries the camera can use and how
many pictures you can expect to shoot on a set of batteries. Then factor
that battery cost into the overall cost of camera ownership. Some cam-
eras come with a battery charger and batteries, which adds up to major
savings over time.
 AC adapters: Many cameras offer an AC adapter that enables you to run
the camera off AC power instead of batteries. Some manufacturers
include the adapter as part of the standard camera package; others
charge extra.
 Ease of use: Have the salesperson
demonstrate how you operate the
various camera controls, and try
those controls yourself. How easily
can you delete a picture, for exam-
ple, or change the resolution?
Are the controls clearly labeled
and easy to manipulate? If not,
the camera may ultimately frus-
trate you.
 Tripod mount: As with a film
camera, if you move a digital
camera during the time the camera
is capturing the image, you get
a blurry picture. And holding a
camera steady for the length of
time it needs to capture the expo-
sure can be difficult, especially
when you’re using the LCD as a
viewfinder or when you’re shoot-
ing in low light (the lower the light, the longer the exposure time).
For that reason, using a tripod can greatly improve your pictures.
Tripod socket
Figure 3-16: The screw socket on the bottom
of the camera is for attaching a tripod.

In order for you to use a tripod, though, your camera must have a tripod
mount — that is, a socket into which the tripod can be screwed, as shown
in Figure 3-16.
 Physical fit: Don’t forget to evaluate the personal side of the camera:
Does it fit into your hands well? Can you reach the shutter button easily?
Can you hold the camera steady as you press the shutter button? Do
you find your fingers getting in the way of the lens, or does your nose
bump up against the LCD when you look through the viewfinder? Is the
viewfinder large enough that you can see through it easily? Don’t just
run out and buy whatever camera a friend or magazine reviewer recom-
mends — make sure that the model you select is a good fit for you.
 Durability: Does the camera seem well built, or is it a little flimsy? For
example, when you open the battery compartment, does the little door
or cover seem durable enough to withstand lots of opening and closing,
or does it look like it might fall off after 50 or 60 uses?
 Computer and camera hookups: Today’s cameras connect via a USB
port (Universal Serial Bus), found on all later model computers. (You can
buy a USB hub to add more ports to your system if needed.) If you’re
buying a used or discontinued camera, it may connect via a serial port.
Some models also offer a wireless connection through technologies
including IrDA and Bluetooth.
Some novice-oriented cameras offer a “one-button transfer” feature.
After connecting the camera to the computer, you press a button to
automatically launch the camera’s image-transfer software and move
your pictures from camera to computer. You can even send images to
friends and family via the Web through a similar automated process.
Whether you need such handholding or not, make sure that the connec-
tion provided by the camera works with your system — or that you can
buy whatever adapters may be needed to bring the two devices
together. Some cameras require that you buy an accessory “docking sta-
tion” in order to enjoy the automatic transfer function. Other models
ship with the dock, which sometimes also serves as a battery charger,
printer, or both.
If you’re buying a camera that records pictures on removable media, of
course, you can always transfer images through a card reader instead of
hooking the camera directly to the computer. But just as a backup, you
should be able to connect your camera “the old-fashioned way” if neces-
sary. You also may need to connect the camera to the computer to
download and install updates to the camera’s firmware — the internal
software that runs the camera.
 Software: Every camera comes with software for downloading images.
But many also come with basic photo-editing software. Because the pro-
grams included with cameras typically retail for under $50, having an
image editor included with the camera isn’t a huge deal. Then again, 50
bucks is 50 bucks, so if all other things are equal, software is something
to consider.

 Warranty, restocking fee, exchange policy: As you would with any
major investment, find out about the camera’s warranty and the return
policy of the store. Be aware that some major electronics stores and
mail-order companies charge a restocking fee, which means that unless
the camera is defective, you’re charged a fee for the privilege of return-
ing or exchanging the camera. Some sellers charge restocking fees of 10
to 20 percent of the camera’s price.
Sources for More Shopping Guidance
If you read this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the fea-
tures you do and don’t want in your digital camera. But I urge you to do some
more in-depth research so that you can find out the details on specific makes
and models.
First, look in digital photography magazines as well as in traditional photog-
raphy magazines such as Shutterbug for reviews on individual digital cameras
and peripherals. Some of the reviews may be too high-tech for your taste or
complete understanding, but if you first digest the information in this chapter
as well as Chapter 2, you should be able to get the gist of things. 
If you have Internet access, you can also find good information on several
Web sites dedicated to digital photography. See Chapter 16 for suggestions
on a few Web sites worth visiting.
Computer magazines and Web sites routinely review digital cameras, too, but I
find their commentary less helpful than what’s available from sources whose
main concern is photography. For example, I’ve seen reviews in a leading 
computer magazine that award the publication’s highest rating to a camera
even though the reviewer calls the image quality only “fair.” Call me crazy
(many do), but I think that a camera isn’t deserving of a good rating, let alone
the highest possible marks, if it can’t produce excellent images!

D
o you remember your first Barbie doll or — if you’re a guy who refuses
to admit playing with a girl’s toy — your first G.I. Joe? In and of them-
selves, the dolls were entertaining enough, especially if the adult who
ruled your household didn’t get too upset when you tried stuff
like shaving Barbie’s head and seeing whether G.I. Joe was
tough enough to withstand a spin in the garbage disposal.
But Barbie and Joe were even more fun if you could talk
someone into buying you some of the many doll acces-
sories on the toy-store shelves. With a few changes of
clothing, a plastic convertible or tank, and loyal doll
friends like Midge and Ken, Dollworld was a much
more interesting place.
Similarly, you can enhance your digital photography
experience by adding a few hardware and software
accessories. Digital camera accessories don’t bring
quite the same rush as a Barbie penthouse or a G.I. Joe
surface-to-air missile, but they greatly expand your cre-
ative options and make some aspects of digital photography
easier.
This chapter introduces you to some of the best camera accessories, from
adapters that speed the process of downloading images, to software that
enables you to retouch and otherwise manipulate your photographs. If you
begin buttering up your loved ones now, I just know that one of them will
cave and buy you one of these goodies soon.

Note that all the prices I quote in this chapter and elsewhere are “street
prices” — what you can expect to pay in retail or online stores. Because
prices for many digital imaging products seem to drop daily, you may be able
to get even more for your money than at the time this book was printed.
Memory Cards and Other Camera Media
If your camera stores pictures on removable storage media, you may have
received one memory card or disc with your camera. At minimum, cameras
that include removable media in the box typically provide at least 16MB of
storage capacity.
In the days when digital cameras produced only low-resolution images, 16MB
was more storage space than most people needed on a regular basis. But
because today’s models can capture many more pixels than cameras even
a few years old, 16MB now represents just a starting point for most digital
photographers.
The good news is that most types of removable camera memory are now
very affordable. You can buy a 256MB card for about $30, less if you watch
the sale ads. 
How many pictures can a memory card hold? That depends on what resolu-
tion and file format you use when you shoot those images. Resolution and file
format both contribute to the size of the image file, and, therefore, how much
memory it consumes. (See Chapter 3 for a full explanation of this issue.)
As an example, Table 4-1 shows approximately how many pictures can fit in
various amounts of memory. The table assumes that the picture is taken
using the JPEG file format with a minor amount of compression — a setting
that translates to good picture quality. If you prefer to shoot in the Raw or
TIFF format, your files are substantially larger. On the other hand, if you use a
lower-quality JPEG setting, file sizes are much smaller.
Your camera manual should provide a table that lists the file sizes of pictures
taken at each of the resolution and format settings the camera offers. Use
these numbers as a guide to how many megabytes of storage you need. Keep
in mind that the more memory you can carry with you, the less often you
need to stop shooting and download pictures to your computer.

Memory shopping tips
Here are a few other pointers on buying camera memory:
 Most cameras can use only one type of memory, so check your manual
for specifics. (For a look at the most popular types of removable
memory, see Chapter 3.) You don’t have to buy any particular brand,
though; it’s the type of card that’s important — CompactFlash, Memory
Stick, and so on.
 Some cards are designated as high-speed cards. These cards can record
picture data more quickly than standard cards — a benefit that’s espe-
cially important to people who take lots of action shots. However, high-
speed cards cost more, and the extra expense may not be worthwhile.
First, your camera must be engineered to take advantage of the higher-
speed cards (most point-and-shoot models are not). Second, you probably
won’t notice a difference unless you’re shooting at high resolutions —
say, 5 megapixels or more. So check your manual or the manufacturer’s
Web site for recommendations before you shell out additional cash for a
high-speed card.
 As with other commodities, you pay less per megabyte when you buy
“in bulk.” A 256MB card costs less per megabyte than a 32MB card, for
example.
 One last tip for owners of cameras that use SmartMedia cards: Most
manufacturers have abandoned SmartMedia as a storage option, which
means that these cards are becoming hard to find at a decent price. You
may want to shop eBay or a similar outlet if you’re in the market for
SmartMedia cards. The cards come in two different voltages, 3.3 volts
and 5 volts, so be sure that you buy the right type. Also note that some
cameras can’t use the highest-capacity SmartMedia cards. Check your
camera manual for specifics on the type and capacity of card to buy.

Care and feeding of memory cards
To protect your memory cards — as well as the images they hold — pay
attention to the following care and maintenance tips:
 When you insert a card into your camera for the first time, you may
need to format the card so that it’s prepared to accept your digital
images. Look in your camera manual for information on how to do this
formatting.
Be careful not to format a card that already contains pictures, however.
Formatting erases all the data on a card.
 Never remove the card while the camera is still recording or accessing
the data on the card. (Most cameras display a little light or indicator to
let you know when the card is in use.)
 Don’t shut off the camera while it’s accessing the card.
 Avoid touching the contact areas of the card. On a CompactFlash card,
for example, keep your mitts off the connector on the bottom of the
card; on a Secure Digital card, the little gold strips are the no-touch
zone. (Most cards ship with a little flyer that alerts you to the sensitive
spots on a card.)
 If your card gets dirty, wipe it clean with a soft, dry cloth. Dirt and grime
can affect the performance of memory cards.
 Try not to expose memory cards to excessive heat or cold, humidity,
static electricity, and strong electrical noise. You don’t need to be overly
paranoid, but use some common sense.
 Ignore rumors about airport security scanners destroying data on
memory cards. Although scan-
ners can damage film, they do no
harm to digital media.
 To keep your cards safe while
not in use, store them in their
original plastic sleeves or boxes.
For a handy way to store and
carry multiple cards, invest in a
memory card wallet. The
Lowepro version shown in
Figure 4-1 has compartments for
batteries as well as memory
cards (www.lowepro.com).

safe storage for spare cards. 

Download Devices
In years past, most digital cameras came with a serial cable for connecting
the camera to the computer. To download images, you plugged the cable into
both devices and used special image-transfer software to move the pictures
from camera to computer. This method of file transfer was excruciatingly
slow — transferring a dozen pictures could easily take 20 minutes or more.
Thankfully, manufacturers have now switched to USB technology for camera-
to-computer connections. (In case you’re wondering, USB stands for
Universal Serial Bus.)
With USB, images flow from camera to computer much more quickly. But you
still have to track down that camera cable every time you want to transfer
pictures to the computer. And you must keep the camera turned on during
the transfer process, so unless your camera came with an AC adapter, you
waste battery power. 
For a better solution, consider the following products: 
 Memory card reader: A card reader is a device that enables you to
transfer images directly from a memory card. You can buy an internal
reader that installs into an empty expansion slot on your computer or an
external reader that connects via USB. Either way, your computer “sees”
the reader as just another drive on the system. You insert a memory
card into the reader and then drag and drop the files from the reader to
your hard drive, just as you would copy files from a CD-ROM or floppy
disk.
You can buy card readers that
accept a single type of memory
card for about $10, but for added
flexibility and long-term func-
tionality, you may want to invest
a little more and get a multi-
format reader such as the
SanDisk model shown in Figure
4-2, which accepts 12 different
types of cards. If you buy a
camera down the road and the
camera uses different media
than your old one, you won’t
need to buy a new reader. You
also can download images taken
by visitors whose cameras use
different media than yours.

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
If your computer is relatively
new, you may already have a
card reader. Many manufacturers
now offer built-in readers for the
most popular types of memory.
 PC Card adapter: Laptop comput-
ers often have a slot for connect-
ing PCMCIA devices (such as
modems and external hard
drives), commonly known as PC
Card devices. You can buy
adapters that enable various types
of memory cards to fit those slots.
Figure 4-3 offers a glimpse of an
adapter for a CompactFlash card.
After putting the memory card in
the adapter, as shown in the
figure, you insert the whole she-
bang into the PC Card slot. The PC
Card shows up as a drive on your computer, and you drag and drop image
files from the card to your hard drive. The cost of a PC Card adapter varies
depending on the type; expect to pay between $10 and $50.
 Docking stations: For some cameras, you can buy accessory camera
docks that also simplify the image-transfer process. A dock is a small
base unit that you leave permanently connected to your computer, usu-
ally via a USB cable. To download pictures, you place the camera into
the dock, press a button or two, and the dock, camera, and computer
work together to automatically start the transfer process.
Most docks also serve as the camera’s battery charger, and some offer
features that simplify e-mailing and printing pictures. You can even buy
docks that have a built-in snapshot printer, such as the Kodak model
shown in Figure 4-4.
A few cameras ship with a docking station; sold alone, docks usually run
in the $50 to $150 range, depending on whether they incorporate a
printer. Check your camera manufacturer’s Web site to see what types of
docks may be available, if any, for your camera.
 Photo printer with memory card slots: If you have a photo printer that
can print directly from your camera’s memory card, you may be able to
transfer images to the computer by way of the printer instead of investing
in a separate card reader. This option may not work well — or at all —
with some printers, especially those that connect via a parallel port,
which doesn’t offer very fast data-transfer speeds. But if you already
own a printer that has memory card slots (or are in the market for a new
printer), check the manual to find out whether this transfer option is
available to you.

Storing Your Picture Files
In the professional digital-imaging world, the hot new topic is digital asset
management. Digital asset management — which, incredibly, is often referred
to by its initials — simply refers to the storing and cataloging of image files.
Professional graphic artists and digital photographers accumulate huge col-
lections of images and are always striving for better ways to save and inven-
tory their assets.
Your image collection may not be as large as that of a professional photogra-
pher’s, but at some point, you, too, need to think about where to keep all those
photos you take. You may be at that point now if you shoot high-resolution
pictures and your computer’s hard drive — the thing that stores all your data
files — is already cramped for space.
Additional storage options are plentiful. Provided that you have the cash, you
can add as many digital closets and shoe boxes to your system as you want.
For starters, you can add an additional hard drive to your computer. An 80GB
external drive costs about $70.
83
Chapter 4: Extra Goodies for Extra Fun

84
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
Although adding a second hard drive may temporarily solve your picture
storage concerns, you also should invest in a storage device that stores data
on removable media. Because hard drives do fail on occasion, making backup
copies on removable media is a necessity. In addition, this option enables
you to give copies of your picture files to other people, something you can’t
do if you have only a hard drive for image storage.
The following list offers my take at the three most popular removable media
devices for home and small-office users (Chapter 8 introduces you to some
cataloging programs that can help you keep track of all your images after you
stow them away):
 Floppy disk: For many years, the most common removable storage
option was the floppy disk. But because they can hold less than 1.5MB of
data — a capacity that makes them unsuitable for storing today’s large
media files — floppies have fallen out of favor. In fact, most computer
manufacturers either don’t provide floppy drives anymore or charge
extra for the feature. If your system does have a floppy drive, you can
use floppies to store only very low-resolution or highly compressed pic-
ture files. On the positive side, the disks are incredibly cheap: You can
get a floppy for less than a quarter if you watch the sale ads.
 Super floppy: Several companies offer removable storage devices com-
monly known as super floppies. These drives save data on disks that are
just a little larger than a floppy but that can hold much more data. The
best-known option in this category is the Iomega Zip drive, available in
100MB, 250MB, and 750MB versions. Some computer vendors now
include Zip drives as standard equipment on desktop and even laptop
systems. If not, you can buy an external Zip drive; expect to pay about
$80 for the smallest-capacity drive and $170 for the largest. Disk prices
range from $10 to $15, depending on capacity.
 CD-ROM: The most affordable and convenient option for long-term stor-
age is to copy your files to a CD-ROM, using a CD recorder, or burner, in
tech talk. If your computer is new, you likely have a built-in CD burner. If
not, you can add an external model to your system for under $100. The
CDs themselves, which can store as much as 650MB of data, cost from
$0.50 to $2, depending on which type you buy. (See the sidebar “CD-R or
CD-RW?” for more on different types of CDs.)
Just a few years ago, I would have told you to avoid CD burners because
they were a little too finicky and the recording software too complicated
for anyone who didn’t care to spend hours learning a slew of new techni-
cal languages and sorting out hardware conflicts. But most of the prob-
lems previously associated with this technology have been resolved,
making the process of burning your own CDs much easier and much
more reliable. Most recorders ship with wizards that walk you through
the process of copying your images to a CD, so you no longer have to be
a technical guru to make things work.

That said, recording your own CDs is by no means as carefree a prospect
as copying files to a floppy or Zip disk:
• Some compatibility issues exist that make it impossible for some
types of homemade CDs to be read by some older computers.
• Even with the software wizards to guide you, you still must deal
with plenty of new and confusing technical terminology when
choosing recording options.
So if techno-babble intimidates you and the occasional unexplained
glitch tempts you to put your fist through your computer monitor, you
may prefer to let the professionals do your CD burning. Most retail
photo labs can burn CDs from camera memory cards.
 DVD: A close cousin to the CD burner, DVD burners enable you to record
your photos onto a DVD (digital video disc). What’s the difference
between CDs and DVDs? Capacity, mostly. A standard single-layer DVD
stores 4.7GB of data, while a CD holds about 650MB. 
Although DVD is poised to overtake the CD as the most popular archival
storage option in the next few years, it’s too new for me to recommend it
as a solution for the average photographer just yet. The industry doesn’t
seem to have settled firmly on a DVD format, which means that DVDs
that you burn today may not be readable by tomorrow’s DVD players.
And of course, you can’t share a DVD with people whose computers
have only the more common CD-ROM drive.
As with any computer data, digital-image data degrades over time. How soon
you begin to lose data depends on the storage media you choose. With
devices that use magnetic media, which includes hard drives, Zip disks, and
floppies, image deterioration starts to become noticeable after about ten
years. In other words, don’t rely on magnetic media for long-term archiving of
images.
CD-ROM storage offers better security. Some manufacturers say that their 
CD-Rs have life expectancies of as much as 100 years, while CD-RWs are said to
survive about 30 years. However, those claims are the subject of some pretty
hot debate right now — and if you ask around, you’re sure to hear horror sto-
ries of CDs going bad. Whether or not the problem stems from the CD itself or
mishandling by the user is the question. But just to be safe, always make two
copies of your image CDs.
For the ultimate in archiving safety, always print your pictures, too. That way,
if something does go wrong with the digital file, you can scan the print and
create a new digital copy. You can make prints easily and cheaply at any retail
lab if you don’t care to do it yourself. See Chapter 9 for help with printing.

On-the-Go Storage and Viewing
Even if you carry several large-capacity memory cards, you can fill them up
quickly if you’re shooting with a high-resolution camera or shooting Raw
files. For times when you can’t easily download pictures from your cards, sev-
eral manufactures offer large-capacity, portable drives. You can download
pictures to one of these units, erase the card, and start shooting again.
Some units, including the Epson P-2000 shown in Figure 4-5, provide a screen
on which you can review your pictures, too. This feature is especially great
for photographers who work with clients in the field; you can show your
work this way rather than pass your camera around after every shot.
Prices vary from about $150 to $500, depending on the storage capacity,
whether a viewing screen is provided, and other features. Many units can
also serve as digital music players, for example, or offer connections to cer-
tain photo printers. You can also connect some storage units to a TV so that
you can view your pictures on a larger screen. The Epson model shown in the
figure can hold 40GB (gigabytes) of data and costs $500.
CD-R or CD-RW?
CD recorders enable you to burn your own CDs —
that is, copy image files or other data onto a com-
pact disc (CD). Two types of recordable CDs exist:
CD-R and CD-RW. The R stands for recordable;
RW stands for rewriteable. Most CD burners can
do either dance.
With CD-R, you can record data until the disc is
full. But you can’t delete files to make room 
for new ones — after you fill the disc once,
you’re done. On the plus side, your images can
never be accidentally erased. CD-Rs are cheap,
too, selling for about $0.50 each or even less 
if you happen upon a special store promotion.
(However, because quality can vary from brand
to brand, I recommend that you stay away 
from no-name, ultra-cheap CD-Rs and stick 
with high-quality discs from a respected 
manufacturer.)
With CD-RW, your CD works just like any other
storage medium. You can get rid of files you no
longer want and store new files in their place.
Although CD-RWs cost more than CD-Rs —
about $2 each — they can be less expensive
over the long run because you can reuse them
as you do a floppy or Zip disk. However, you
shouldn’t rely on CD-RWs for archiving pur-
poses. For one thing, you can accidentally over-
write or erase an important image file. For
another, data on CD-RWs starts to degrade after
about 30 years, while CD-Rs can last as long as
100 years. (See my earlier note on this issue.)
One other important factor distinguishes CD-R
from CD-RW: compatibility with existing
CD-ROM drives. If you’re creating CDs to share
images with other people, you should know that
those people need multiread CD drives to
access files on a CD-RW. This type of CD drive
is being implemented in new computer systems,
but most older systems do not have multiread
drives. Older computers can usually read CD-Rs
without problems, however. (Depending on the
recording software you use, you may need to
format and record the disc using special options
that ensure compatibility with older CD drives.)

Software Solution
Flashy and sleek, digital cameras are the natural stars of the digital-imaging
world. But without the software that enables you to access and manipulate
your images, your digital camera would be nothing more than an overpriced
paperweight. Because I know that you have plenty of other had-to-have-it,
never-use-it devices that can serve as paperweights, the following sections
introduce you to some software products that help you get the most from
your digital camera.
Image-editing software
Image-editing software enables you to alter your digital photos in just about
any way you see fit. You can correct problems with brightness, contrast,
color balance, and the like. You can crop out excess background and get rid
of unwanted image elements. You can also apply special effects, combine pic-
tures into a collage, and explore countless other artistic notions. Part IV of
this book provides you with a brief introduction to photo editing to get you
started on your creative journey.
Today’s computer stores, mail-order catalogs, and online shopping sites are
stocked with an enormous array of photo-editing products. But all these pro-
grams can be loosely grouped into two categories: entry-level and advanced.
The following sections help you determine which type fits your needs.
87
Chapter 4: Extra Goodies for Extra Fun

88
Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
Programs for first-timers
Several companies offer programs geared to the photo-editing novice.
Popular choices include ArcSoft PhotoImpression (www.arcsoft.com), Paint
Shop Photo Album (www.corel.com), and Microsoft Picture It! Premium
(www.microsoft.com), all available for under $50.
These programs provide a basic set of image-correction tools plus plenty
of on-screen hand-holding. Wizards (step-by-step on-screen guides) walk
you through different editing tasks, and project templates simplify the
process of adding your photo to a business card, calendar, e-mail postcard,
or greeting card. In Figure 4-6, I’m creating a calendar using Paint Shop
Photo Album.
Figure 4-6: Consumer photo-editing programs offer templates for putting photos on calendars and other print
materials.

Within this category, the range of editing and effects tools provided varies
widely, so read product reviews to make sure that the program you get
enables you to do the photographic projects you have in mind. See Chap-
ter 16 for the names of some Web sites where you can find this kind of 
information.
Programs with more power
Although the entry-level programs I discuss in the preceding section provide
enough tools to keep most casual users happy, people who edit pictures on a
daily basis or just want a little more control over their images may want to
move up the software ladder a notch. Advanced photo-editing programs pro-
vide you with more flexible, more powerful, and, often, more convenient
photo-editing tools than entry-level offerings.
What kind of additional features do you get for your money? Here’s just one
example to illustrate the differences between beginner and advanced pro-
grams. Say that you want to retouch an image that’s overexposed. In an
entry-level program, you typically are limited to adjusting the exposure for all
colors in the image by the same degree. But in an advanced program, you can
adjust the highlights, shadows, and midtones (areas of medium brightness)
independently — so that you can make a businessman’s white shirt even
whiter without also giving his dark brown hair and beige suit a bleach job.
Additionally, using tools known as dodge and burn tools, you can “brush on”
lightness and darkness as if you were painting with a paintbrush. In some
programs, you can even apply exposure adjustments in a way that preserves
all the original image data in case you decide later that you don’t like the
results of your changes. And that’s but a sampling of your many options — all
just for adjusting exposure.
Advanced programs also include tools that enable power-users to accom-
plish complicated tasks more quickly. Some programs enable you to record a
series of editing steps and then play the editing routine back to apply those
same edits to a batch of images, for example.
The downside to advanced programs is that they can be intimidating to new
users and also require a high learning curve. You usually don’t get much on-
screen assistance or any of the templates and wizards provided in beginner-
level programs. Figure 4-7, for example, offers a look at Adobe Photoshop
(www.adobe.com), the leading professional photo editor. Not exactly what
you’d call intuitive. So expect to spend plenty of time with the program
manual or a third-party book to become proficient at using the software
tools. Photoshop is also expensive, selling for just under $600.

Part I: Peering through the Digital Viewfinder 
Figure 4-7: Adobe Photoshop is a top choice for serious imaging enthusiasts.
Fortunately, several good, less-expensive alternatives exist for users who
don’t need the ultra-high-end power of Photoshop. Perhaps the best known
program is Adobe Photoshop Elements, which sells for about $100 and is the
software featured in Part IV of this book. Elements includes Photoshop’s
basic power tools but also provides some of the same type of help features
provided in consumer-level programs. Other good choices in the same price
range are Corel Paint Shop Pro (www.corel.com), Ulead PhotoImpact
(www.ulead.com), and Microsoft Digital Image Suite (www.microsoft.com).
Note that Corel Paint Shop Pro was formerly known as Jasc Paint Shop Pro;
Corel acquired Jasc Software and its very popular Paint Shop Pro product.
Before you invest in any imaging program, no matter how expensive, you’re
smart to give the program a whirl on your computer, using your images.
Many software vendors make free trial versions available on their Web sites.
For a quick way to explore your options, visit the Web page for this book,
www.dummies.com/go/digitalphotofd5e. The page offers links to sites where
you can find out more about all the software I mention.

Specialty software
In addition to programs designed specifically for photo editing, you can find
great programs geared to special digital photography needs and interests.
The following list discusses some of my favorites:
 Image-cataloging programs assist you in keeping track of all your
images. As mentioned earlier, some industry gurus refer to these pro-
grams as digital asset management (DAM) tools. But you can just call
them cataloging programs and get along fine with me. I don’t think you
want to walk into a computer store and ask to see all the DAM programs,
anyway. Figure 4-8 offers a look at one such program, ThumbsPlus ($50,
www.cerious.com), and Chapter 8 provides more information about this
kind of software.
Figure 4-8: Cataloging programs such as ThumbsPlus make it easier to organize your photo files.

 Slide-show programs make it easy to produce multimedia presentations
featuring your photos. See Chapter 1 for a look at one program in this
category, SimpleStar PhotoShow Deluxe (www.simplestar.com).
 Special-effects plug-ins can add to the functionality of your photo editor.
One of my favorite programs of this type is nik Color Efex Pro (www.
nikmultimedia.com), featured in Figure 4-9. This plug-in package enables
you to create effects similar to those produced by traditional camera 
filters as well as cool special effects. It works with many popular photo
editors, including Photoshop Elements. Pricing ranges from $80 to $300,
depending on which effects collection you buy.
 Digital painting programs enable you to create original artwork or use
your photos to create images that have the look of traditional art media.
Chapter 13 gives you a look at a leading program in this category, Corel
Painter.
Figure 4-9: Special-effects plug-ins such as this one from nik multimedia add more 
creative options to your photo-editing software.
Finally, you can find several programs that fall into the “pure fun” category,
such as BrainsBreaker, shown in Figure 4-10. With this $20 program
(www.brainsbreaker.com), you can turn any photo into a digital jigsaw
puzzle. You put the puzzle together by dragging pieces into place with your
mouse — an endeavor that I find enormously addictive, I should add.

Figure 4-10: BrainsBreaker turns any digital photo into a virtual jigsaw puzzle.
Camera Accessories
So far, I’ve focused on accessories to make your life easier and more fun after
you shoot your digital pictures. But the items in the following list are even
more essential because they help you capture great pictures in the first
place:
 Special lens adapter and lenses: If your camera can accept other lenses,
you can expand your range of creativity by investing in a wide-angle,
close-up, or telephoto lens (telephoto lenses are designed for making
faraway objects appear closer). With some cameras, you can add sup-
plementary wide-angle and telephoto elements that slip over the normal
camera lens. The price range of these accessories varies depending on
the quality and type and whether or not you need a separate adapter to
fit the lens to your camera.

 Tripod: If your pictures continually suffer from soft focus, camera shake
is one possible cause — and using a tripod is a good cure. You can
spend a little or a lot on a tripod, with models available for anywhere
from $20 to several hundred dollars. I can tell you that I’ve been quite
happy with my $20 model, though. And at that price, I don’t worry about
tossing the thing into the trunk when I travel. Just be sure that the
tripod you buy is sturdy enough to handle the weight of your camera.
You may want to take your camera with you when you shop so that you
can see how well the tripod works with your camera.
Alfred DeBat, technical editor for this book, suggests this method for
testing a tripod’s sturdiness: Set the tripod at its maximum height, push
down on the top camera platform, and try turning the tripod head as
though it were a doorknob. If the tripod twists easily, look for a different
model.
 LCD hoods: If you have difficulty viewing images on your camera’s LCD
monitor in bright light, you may want to invest in an LCD hood. Hoods
wrap around the monitor to create a four-sided awning that reduces
glare on the screen. Several companies, including Hoodman (www.
hoodmanusa.com) make custom-tailored hoods for a variety of digital
cameras.
 Light dome or box: If you take product shots of shiny or sparkly objects,
such as glass or jewelry, you may find it almost impossible to avoid get-
ting reflections or glare from your flash or other light source. You can
solve this problem by using a light dome or tent, which serves as a diffu-
sion screen between the objects and the light source. Chapter 6 shows
examples.
 Camera case: Digital cameras are sensitive pieces of electronic equip-
ment, and if you want them to perform well, you need to protect them
from hazards of daily life. No camera is likely to take great pictures
after being dropped on the sidewalk, being banged around inside a 
briefcase, or suffering other physical abuse on a regular basis. So when-
ever you’re not using the camera, you should stow it in a well-padded
camera case.
You can pick up a decent, padded case for about $10 at a discount store.
Or if you want to spend a little more, head for a camera store, where you
can buy a full-fledged digital camera bag that has room for all your bat-
teries and other gear. Some digital cameras do come with their own
cases, but most of these cases are pretty flimsy and not up to the job of
keeping your camera safe from harm. You’re spending lots of money on
a camera, so do yourself a favor and invest a little more on a proper pro-
tective case.

Mouse Replacement Therapy: The Drawing Tablet
To wrap up this chapter, I want to introduce you to one more accessory that
doesn’t fit nicely into any of the other categories: a digital drawing tablet.
A drawing tablet enables you to do your photo editing using a pen stylus
instead of a mouse. If you do a good deal of intricate touch-up work on your
pictures or you enjoy digital painting or drawing, you’ll wonder what you
ever did without a tablet after you try one.
Professional drawing tablets run as high as $700, but you don’t need to spend
anywhere near that much to enjoy the benefits of a decent tablet. Wacom, the
industry leader in the tablet arena, offers a consumer-oriented model called
the Graphire (www.wacom.com). The model shown in Figure 4-11 has an
active drawing area of about 6 x 8 inches and sells for about $200, but a
smaller, 4 x 5-inch model is available for under $100. (For the record, I’ve
been using a 4 x 5 tablet for years and never longed for more drawing space.)
The Graphire comes with both a stylus and cordless mouse so that you can
switch back and forth easily between the two devices.

I never metadata I didn’t like
Most digital cameras, especially those at the
mid- to high end of the consumer price range,
store metadata along with picture data when
recording an image to memory. Metadata is a
fancy name for information that gets stored in a
special area of the image file. Digital cameras
record such information as the aperture, shut-
ter speed, exposure compensation, and other
camera settings as metadata.
To capture and retain metadata, digital cameras
typically store images using a variation of the
JPEG file format known as EXIF, which stands for
exchangeable image format. This flavor of JPEG
is often stated in camera literature as JPEG (EXIF).
You can view metadata in many photo-editing
and cataloging programs, such as Corel Paint
Shop Photo Album, shown in the following
figure. The image-transfer software that ships
with your camera may also offer this feature.
By reviewing the metadata for each image, you
can get a better grasp on how the various settings
on your camera affect your images. It’s like having
a personal assistant trailing around after you,
making a record of your photographic choices
each time you press the shutter button — only
you don’t have to feed this assistant lunch or
provide health insurance.

Part II
Ready, Set, Shoot!

In this part . . .
M
ost digital cameras are categorized as
“point-and-shoot” cameras. That is, you’re
supposed to be able to simply point the camera
at your subject and shoot the picture.
But as is the case with point-and-shoot ﬁlm cam-
eras, picture-taking with a digital camera isn’t
quite as automatic as the camera manufacturers
would like you to believe. Before you aim that lens
and press the shutter button, you need to consider
quite a few factors if you want to come away with
a good picture, as this part of the book reveals.
Chapter 5 walks you through the initial camera
setup process, explaining which options to use
in which shooting scenarios. Chapter 6 tells you
everything you need to know about two primary
components of a great photograph: exposure and
focus. Chapter 7 builds on those fundamentals by
offering tips on composing photos, capturing
action, working with a zoom lens, and more.
By abandoning the point-and-shoot approach and
adopting the think-point-and-shoot strategies out-
lined in this part, you, too, can turn out impres-
sive digital photographs. At the very least, you
will no longer wind up with pictures in which the
top of your subject’s head is cut off or the focus is
so far gone that people ask why you took pictures
on such a foggy day.

D
igital camera manufacturers work hard to create a good “out of box”
experience — that is, to make your first encounter with
your camera fun, easy, and rewarding. To that end, cameras
leave the factory in automatic picture-taking mode, using
default settings that are likely to produce a good picture
the first time you press the shutter button.
Your camera’s default settings can’t deliver the best
images in every situation, however. Capturing a
properly exposed photo at a nighttime ballgame, for
example, requires different settings than you need
on a sunny afternoon.
So after the initial excitement of taking your first few
pictures wears off, grab your camera and manual and
spend an hour or so going through all the controls avail-
able to you. To help you sort through which options to use
when, this chapter explains the basics of digital image capture,
discussing controls such as file format, resolution (pixel count), and
white balance. Chapter 6 continues the discussion with a thorough explana-
tion of exposure and focus options.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Getting Started: Basic Camera Settings
Somewhere on the back of your
camera, you should find a button that
displays a setup menu in the camera’s
LCD monitor, as shown in Figure 5-1.
In addition to standard photographic
options such as exposure and flash,
many cameras offer the following
basic operational settings:
 Date/Time: This setting is per-
haps the most critical of the
basic operation controls. Your
camera records the current date
and time in the image file, along
with details about what other
camera settings were in force
when you shot the picture. In many photo editors and image browsers,
you can view this information, known as EXIF metadata.
Having the correct date and time in the image file enables you to have a
permanent record of when each picture was taken. More importantly, in
many photo programs, you can search for all the pictures taken on a par-
ticular date. Figure 5-2 shows one program with this feature, ACDSee
(www.acdsystems.com).
 Auto shut-off: To conserve battery power, many cameras turn off auto-
matically after a few minutes of inactivity. The drawback is that you can
miss fleeting photographic opportunities; by the time you restart the
camera, your subject may be gone.
If your camera doesn’t allow you to disable this feature, you can prevent
shut-down by pressing the shutter button down halfway to activate the
autofocus/autoexposure mechanism. (The next chapter explains both.)
On cameras with a zoom lens, you also can zoom in or out a little.
 Instant review: After you take a picture, your camera may display it
automatically for a few seconds. You may want to turn this function off
when you’re trying to capture fast-paced subjects because the camera
won’t take another picture until the review period is passed. And
because monitors consume power, also turn off instant review if you’re
worried about running out of battery juice.
 Monitor brightness: Adjusting the monitor brightness can make pictures
easier to view in bright light. But be careful: The monitor may then give
you a false impression of your image exposure. Before you put your
camera away, double-check your pictures in a setting where you can use
the default brightness level.
 Auto-rotate: This feature automatically rotates pictures that you take
with a vertical orientation so that they display properly in the camera
Figure 5-1: Scroll through camera menus to
discover what options are available.

monitor. Hmm. I usually can find the downside of anything, but I’ll be
darned if I can think of one for this option.
 TV/video format (NTSC, PAL, or SECAM): If your camera has a video-out
feature, which enables you to hook your camera to a TV, VCR, or DVD
player, you may get the choice of these three video-signal formats. Most
North American countries go with NTSC, as does Japan. In Europe, PAL
is the standard. You can find the proper format for other countries by
doing a quick Web search.
 Sound effects: Digital cameras are big on sounds: Some play a little ditty
when the camera is turned on. Some beep to let you know that the
camera’s autofocus or autoexposure mechanism has done its thing, and
others emit a little “shutter” sound as you take the picture. I even
worked with one model that said “Goodbye” in this odd little digitized
voice when you turned the camera off. Before heading to a wedding or
any other event where your camera’s bells and whistles won’t be appre-
ciated, check your camera menu to see whether you can silence them or
at least turn down the volume.
Some cameras offer “museum mode.” When you choose this setting, the
camera automatically stifles its vocal chords and also disables the flash
(because flash photography isn’t permitted in most museums).
Figure 5-2: Because the date is recorded with the picture file, you can easily track down
pictures taken during a certain period.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Selecting a File Format
Your camera may offer a choice of file types, or formats, in digital lingo. The
format determines how the camera records and stores all the bits of data that
comprise a digital photo. This setting affects file size, picture quality, and
what types of computer programs you need to view and edit the photo.
Although many formats have been developed for digital images, camera man-
ufacturers have settled — at least for now — on just three: JPEG, TIFF, and
Camera Raw. Each of these formats has its pros and cons, and which one is
best depends on your picture-taking needs. The next three sections tell you
what you need to know to make a file-format decision.
Keep in mind that some cameras don’t offer a separate file format control but
instead give you a choice of resolution (pixel count) and format combina-
tions. You need to open that manual to find out how your model approaches
these options.
Also, be careful not to confuse your camera’s file format control with the one
that formats your camera memory card. The latter erases all data on your
card. Don’t freak out about this possibility: When you choose the card format
option, your camera displays a warning to let you know that you’re about to
dump data. You get no such message for the file format control.
JPEG
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is standard on every camera. JPEG stands for
Joint Photographic Experts Group, the organization that developed the format.
JPEG is the leading camera format for two important reasons:
 Web-friendly photos: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display
JPEG images, which means that you can share your pictures online sec-
onds after you shoot them.
 Small file sizes: JPEG files are smaller than those captured in other for-
mats, so you can store more pictures in your camera’s memory. Smaller
files also take less time to transmit over the Web.
The drawback to JPEG is that you may trade off picture quality for the smaller
file size and online convenience. In order to trim file size, JPEG applies lossy
compression, a process that eliminates some original image data. (Many digital
imaging experts refer to this process as simply JPEG compression.)

Compare the uncompressed portrait in Figure 5-3 with its highly compressed
cousin in Figure 5-4. Excessive compression gives the image a tiled look and
often causes a defect known as color artifacting. Notice the bluish tinges
around the eyelashes and near the jaw line in Figure 5-4? That’s artifacting.
Now for the good news: Most cameras offer a JPEG setting that applies only a
little bit of compression, which significantly reduces file size without produc-
ing noticeable damage. At a minimum compression setting, JPEG is the right
format choice for all but the most demanding photographers.
Figure 5-3: No compression means top photo quality, but large file sizes.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Figure 5-4: Too much JPEG compression destroys picture quality.
As an example, Figure 5-5 shows a lightly compressed version of the portrait.
The file size is reduced from 2.8MB to 400K, and you have to look hard to see
any loss of image detail.
Figuring out what JPEG options are available to you requires a look at the
camera manual. Typically, compression settings are given vague monikers:
Good/Better/Best or High/Normal/Basic, for example.
These names refer not to the amount of compression being applied, but to
the resulting image quality. If you set your camera to the Best setting, for
example, the image is compressed less than if you choose the Good setting.
Of course, the less you compress the image, the larger its file size, and the
fewer images you can fit in the available camera memory.
33K

Figure 5-5: A little compression reduces file size without too much damage.
You should find a chart in your manual that indicates how many images
you can fit into a certain amount of memory at different compression set-
tings. But you need to experiment to find out exactly how each setting
affects picture quality. Shoot the same image at all the different settings to
get an idea of how much damage you do if you opt for a higher degree of
compression.
If your camera offers several resolution settings, do the compression test for
each resolution setting; remember, resolution and compression work
together to determine image quality. You usually get away with more com-
pression at a higher resolution. Low resolution combined with heavy com-
pression yields results even a mother couldn’t love.

Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Camera Settings

106
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
When you edit your images in a photo editor, you can save your altered file in
the JPEG format. At that point, you have the option of applying another
round of compression. Because each pass through the compression machine
does further damage, you should instead save works-in-progress in a format
such as TIFF (see the next section), which does a much better job of preserv-
ing picture quality. See Chapter 11 for a primer on saving your edited photos
and refer to Chapter 10 for details on saving in the JPEG format.
TIFF
TIFF stands for Tagged Image File Format, in case you care, which you really
shouldn’t. TIFF — say it tiff — is designed for folks who don’t care for the
data loss that occurs with JPEG compression. 
Whether or not you notice a significant quality difference between a TIFF
image and a lightly compressed JPEG depends on the camera, however. I cre-
ated the uncompressed picture in Figure 5-3 in the TIFF format, for example,
and even I can’t discern a huge difference between it and the lightly com-
pressed JPEG version in Figure 5-5.
In addition, TIFF files are much larger than JPEG files, and Web browsers and
e-mail programs can’t display TIFF photos. You need to open TIFF pictures in
a photo editor and convert them to JPEG before you can share them online.
(Chapter 10 tells you how.)
For these reasons, JPEG is a better choice unless your number one concern is
optimum picture quality, you have no worries about running out of space on
your camera memory card, and you don’t mind the extra step of converting
to JPEG for online use.
Camera Raw 
When you shoot in the JPEG or TIFF format, your camera takes the data col-
lected by the image sensor and then applies certain enhancements — expo-
sure correction, color adjustments, sharpening, and so on — before
recording the final image. These changes are based on the picture character-
istics that the manufacturer believes its customers prefer.
The Camera Raw format, sometimes called simply Raw, was developed for
photo purists who don’t want the camera manufacturer to make those deci-
sions. Camera Raw records data straight from the sensor, without applying
any post-capture processes. You get “uncooked” data, if you will.

Unlike JPEG and TIFF, Camera Raw is not a standardized format. Each manu-
facturer uses different data specifications and names for its Raw format.
Nikon Raw files are called NEF files, for example, while Canon’s version go by
the name CRW.
Raw files are uncompressed, which means that they are larger than JPEG
files. In addition, after transferring your pictures to your computer, you must
use a special software tool called a Raw converter to convert your photos to
TIFF or JPEG before you can do much of anything with them. Figure 5-6 shows
you the converter from Adobe Photoshop Elements; Chapter 8 details the
conversion process.
Because of the added complication of working with Raw files, I recommend
that you stick with JPEG or TIFF if you’re a photo-editing novice. Frankly, the
in-camera processing that occurs with those two formats is likely to produce
results that are at least as good as, if not better, than what you can do in your
photo editor.
Figure 5-6: You must open Raw files using a special conversion tool.
107
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Camera Settings

108
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
For my part, I simply find Raw too much trouble for day-to-day picture taking.
The only time I use Raw is when I can’t get the results I want from TIFF or
JPEG. When shooting the image in Figure 5-6, for example, I had the kiwi
slices on top of a light box so that they were lit from below. (Don’t ask — it
was one of those 3 a.m. ideas that never works out as well as you hope.) No
matter what camera settings I tried, I couldn’t arrive at the balance of color,
exposure, and contrast that I wanted with JPEG or TIFF. So I switched to Raw
so that I could better control those qualities.
Some cameras offer a setting called JPEG+Raw. With this option, the camera
creates both a Raw file and a JPEG file that’s appropriately sized for online
sharing. Of course, you consume even more camera memory with this option
because you’re creating two files.
Setting the Pixel Count (Resolution)
Depending on your camera, you may be able to select from two or more
image resolution settings. This option determines how many total pixels the
image will contain, not pixels per inch (ppi). You set this second value in your
photo editor before you print your pictures. (See Chapter 2 for the complete
story.) 
DNG: Format of the future?
Adobe Systems recently introduced another
digital-camera file format, DNG. Short for
Digital Negative Format, DNG was created in
response to growing concerns about the fact
that every camera manufacturer uses its own,
specially engineered flavor of Camera Raw. This
Tower of Picture Babel makes it difficult for soft-
ware designers to create programs that can
open every type of Raw file, which in turn makes
it difficult for people to share Raw files. That
issue isn’t a huge problem for the average con-
sumer, but it’s a pain for professionals who must
work with Raw images from many photogra-
phers. In addition, the possibility exists that
future software may not support earlier gener-
ations of Raw files, leaving people with images
they can no longer open (think Betamax video-
tapes and 8-track audio recordings).
The goal of DNG is to create a standard raw-
data format that all camera manufacturers can
embrace. That hasn’t happened yet, but if you
want to translate your current Raw files to DNG,
the Adobe Web site (www.adobe.com) offers a
free converter that can handle files from most
current digital cameras. Of course, there’s no
guarantee that DNG will be around 100 years
from now, either, and most photo software can’t
yet open DNG files. But with Adobe backing the
format, my guess is that DNG will one day be as
common as JPEG or TIFF. 

The resolution option is presented in differ-
ent ways, depending on the camera. You
may be given a choice of pixel dimensions,
as shown in the top image in Figure 5-7, or
total pixel count, as shown in the bottom
example. (MP stands for megapixel, or 1
million pixels.) Some cameras take another
approach, using vague options such as
Basic, Fine, and Superfine, which often
control pixel population, file format, and
compression amount together. Your camera
manual should spell out exactly how you
go about changing the resolution and how
many pixels you get with each setting.
When setting capture resolution, consider
the final output of the image. For Web pic-
tures, you can get by with 640 x 480 pixels
or even 320 x 240 pixels. But if you want
to print your picture, choose the capture
setting that comes closest to giving
you the output resolution — pixels per
inch, or ppi — that your printer manual
recommends.
Again, Chapter 2 explains all this in more
detail and provides illustrations to show
you the impact of pixel count on picture
quality. But for quick reference, Table 5-1
shows you the minimum pixel count you
need to produce acceptable prints at standard sizes; I’m assuming an output
resolution of 200 ppi. (You may be able to generate a good print with fewer
pixels, however, so experiment with your own camera and print.) Figure 5-8
shows portions of the low, medium, and high-resolution examples from
Chapter 2 to remind you of just how crummy a picture looks if you don’t
snag enough pixels.

pictures.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Figure 5-8: Low resolution means low-quality prints.
Keep these additional pixel pointers in mind:
 The more pixels, the bigger the picture file and the more memory your
image consumes. So if your camera has limited memory and you’re
shooting at a location where you can’t download images, you may want
to choose a lower resolution setting so that you can fit more pictures
into the available memory. Alternatively, you may be able to reduce file
size by changing the file format or applying more JPEG compression, as I
discuss earlier in this chapter.
 Some cameras provide a dual-capture option: Your picture is recorded
twice, once at the highest-resolution setting you specify and once at a
smaller size that’s suitable for Web or e-mail use.
 The pixel-capture settings on your digital camera likely won’t match up
exactly with the numbers you see in Table 5-1 because digital camera
images have a different aspect ratio than traditional print sizes, which
are based on the proportions of 35mm film. A digital camera image has
an aspect ratio of 4:3, which means it is four units wide by three units
tall (just like a traditional computer monitor). A 35mm film negative has
an aspect ratio of 3:2, which is why the 4 x 6 print emerged as a standard
snapshot size. When figuring your necessary pixel count, just get as
close as you can (or higher than) the numbers you see in Table 5-1.
300 ppi
75 ppi
150 ppi

However, some cameras offer a special resolution setting that produces
an image with the traditional 3:2 aspect ratio. This setting is highlighted
on the Kodak model shown in Figure 5-7. A few new cameras even offer
the option of capturing images that conform to the 16:9 proportions
used by wide-screen televisions.
 The numbers in the table assume that you’re printing the entire photo.
If you crop the photo, you need more original pixels because you’re get-
ting rid of a portion of the image.
 On some cameras, capture resolution is lowered automatically when you
use certain features. For example, many cameras provide a burst mode
that enables you to record a series of images with one press of the shut-
ter button (see Chapter 7 for information). When you use this mode,
some cameras reduce the resolution to 640 x 480 pixels or lower.
Balancing Your Whites and Colors
Different light sources have varying color temperatures, which is a fancy way
of saying that they contain different amounts of red, green, and blue light.
Color temperature is measured on the Kelvin scale, illustrated in Figure 5-9.
The midday sun has a color temperature of about 5500 Kelvin, which is often
abbreviated as 5500K — not to be confused with 5500 kilobytes, abbreviated
as 5500K. When two worlds as full of technical lingo as photography and
computers collide, havoc ensues. If you’re ever unsure as to which K is being
discussed, just nod your head thoughtfully and say, “Yes, I see your point.”

Anyway, what’s important about color temperature is that it affects how a
camera — video, digital, or film — perceives the colors of the objects being
photographed. If you’ve taken pictures in fluorescent lighting, you may have
noticed a slight green tint to your photographs. The tint comes from the
color of fluorescent light.
Film photographers use special films or lens filters designed to compensate
for different light sources. But digital cameras, like video cameras, get around
the color-temperature problem using a process known as white balancing.
White balancing simply tells the camera what combination of red, green, and
blue light it should perceive as pure white, given the current lighting condi-
tions. With that information as a baseline, the camera can then accurately
reproduce the other colors in the scene.
On most digital cameras, white balancing is handled automatically. But many
models provide manual white-balance controls as well. Why would you want
to make manual white-balance adjustments? Because sometimes, automatic
white balancing doesn’t go quite far enough in removing unwanted color
casts. If you notice that your whites aren’t really white or that the image has
an unnatural tint, you can sometimes correct the problem by choosing a dif-
ferent white-balance setting. Table 5-2 shows some common manual settings.

Figure 5-10 gives you an idea of how image colors are affected by white-balance
settings. I took these pictures with a Nikon digital camera. Normally, the auto-
matic white-balance feature on this camera, as on other cameras, works pretty
well. But this shooting location threw the camera a curve ball because the
subject is lit by three different light sources. Like most office buildings, the
one in which this picture was taken has fluorescent lights, which light the
subject from above. To the subject’s left (the right side of the picture), bright
daylight was shining through a large picture window. And just to make things
even more complicated, I switched on the camera’s flash.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
The image has a slightly yellowish cast at the Automatic setting. That’s
because in the Automatic mode, the camera I was using selects the Flash
white-balance setting when the flash is turned on (which is why the results of
the Flash mode and the Automatic mode are the same in the figure). But the
Flash mode balances colors for the temperature of the flash only and doesn’t
account for the two other light sources hitting the subject. In my shooting
scenario, the Fluorescent setting achieved the most accurate color balance,
with the Sunny option coming in a close second.
Although white-balance controls are designed to improve color accuracy,
some digital photographers use them to mimic the effects produced by tradi-
tional color filters, such as a warming filter. As illustrated by Figure 5-10,
you can get a variety of takes on the same scene simply by varying the 
white-balance setting. How each setting affects your image colors depends
on lighting conditions.
If your camera doesn’t offer white-balance adjustment or you just forget to
think about this issue when you’re shooting, you can remove unwanted color
casts or give your picture a warmer or cooler tone in the photo-editing stage.
Chapter 11 gives you information on color adjustments.
Tweaking Picture “Processing”
As you scroll through your camera’s menus, you’re likely to find a few
options that enable you to tweak color saturation, contrast, and other
aspects of your picture. With a film camera, these enhancements are done
during the film processing and printing; with a digital camera, they’re applied
right in the camera (assuming that you’re not shooting in the Camera Raw
format, which I discuss earlier in this chapter).
Because every camera applies these changes differently, you need to experi-
ment with your model to see whether you want to deviate from the default
settings. On the whole, I prefer to make these kinds of changes in my photo-
editing software because you get more control and because the camera moni-
tor doesn’t always reflect the most accurate view of your pictures.
One post-capture option that can be dangerous is sharpening, a process that
boosts contrast to create the illusion of sharper focus. You can easily add
more sharpening in a photo editor, but fixing an overly sharpened picture —
which has a rough, grainy look — is difficult.

In addition, many cameras offer an option that creates a grayscale or sepia-
toned photo, as shown in Figure 5-11. These options are fine, but keep in
mind that you can’t go back after the fact and add the original colors back to
the image. So when in doubt, shoot in normal color; as with sharpening, cre-
ating a grayscale or sepia version of a color image in a photo editor is a
breeze. Most photo editing programs offer one-click filters that do the job.

etting a grip on the digital characteristics of your camera —
resolution, white balance, and so on — is critical. But
don’t get so involved in these new picture-taking issues
that you overlook the traditional fundamentals of expo-
sure and focus. All the megapixels in the world can’t
save a too dark, too light, or blurry picture.
Chapter 2 covers the basics of exposure, detailing
the interaction between shutter speed, aperture,
and ISO, while Chapter 3 introduces you to focusing
basics. This chapter provides tips and techniques to
help you better manipulate exposure and focus. In
addition to showing you how to get good results from

to become more creative in how you harness the power of
light and lens.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Setting Light Sensitivity: ISO
As you know if you’ve read Chapter 2, the size of the lens aperture and the
shutter speed work together to control how much light enters the camera
when you take a picture. The amount of light you need to produce a proper
exposure depends on the sensitivity of the camera’s recording medium — the
negative, in a film camera, or the imaging sensor, in a digital camera.
Film is assigned an ISO number to indicate light sensitivity. The higher the
number, the “faster” the film — meaning that it reacts more quickly to light,
enabling you to shoot in dim lighting without a flash or to use a faster shutter
speed or smaller aperture.
Many digital cameras also offer a choice of ISO settings, which theoretically
gives you the same flexibility as working with different speeds of film. I say
“theoretically” because raising the ISO can have a downside that outweighs
the potential advantage. Pictures shot at a higher ISO sometimes suffer from
noise, which is a fancy way of referring to a speckled, grainy texture. Faster
film also produces grainier pictures than slower film, but the quality differ-
ence seems to be greater when you shoot digitally.
Figure 6-1 illustrates the impact of ISO on quality. I took all four images in pro-
grammed autoexposure mode but used different ISO settings for each shot:
200, 400, 800, and 1600. As I doubled the ISO, the camera increased the shut-
ter speed or reduced the aperture — or both — to produce the same expo-
sure as at the lower ISO. But each shift up in ISO meant a step down in image
quality.
When you print pictures at a small size, noise may not be apparent to the
eye; instead, the image may have a slightly blurry look, as in Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-2 shows close-up views of each image so that you can more easily
compare the loss of detail and increase in noise.
For some shooting scenarios, you may be forced to use a higher ISO. Had I
waited for the sun to recede a little farther when taking my twilight shots, for
example, the camera wouldn’t have been able to produce a properly exposed
photo at all at the lower ISO settings. And if you’re trying to capture a moving
subject, you may need to raise the ISO in order to use the fast shutter speed
necessary to freeze the action.
The bottom line is this: Experiment with ISO settings if your camera offers
them, and by all means, go with a higher ISO if the alternative is not getting
the shot at all. But for best picture quality, keep the ISO at its lowest or next-
to-lowest setting. (How far up you can go depends on the camera, so take
some test shots to evaluate quality at each setting.) 

Figure 6-1: Raising the ISO setting increases light sensitivity, but also can produce a 
defect known as noise.
I do recommend, however, that you avoid automatic ISO adjustment, a 
feature that tells the camera to set the ISO based on the available light.
The camera may ramp up the ISO to a point that produces more noise
than is acceptable to you. Better to control this aspect of your picture-
taking yourself.

Automatic Exposure: Making It Work
Most digital cameras, from the most basic to high-priced D-SLR (digital SLR)
models, offer autoexposure mode, sometimes known as programmed autoex-
posure. This feature does just what its name implies: The camera reads the
light in the scene and then sets the exposure automatically.
Today’s autoexposure mechanisms are incredibly capable. But in order for
the feature to work correctly, you need to take this three-step approach to
shooting pictures:
1. Frame your subject in the viewfinder or monitor.
ISO 200
ISO 400
ISO 800
ISO 1600

2. Press the shutter button halfway and hold it there.
The camera analyzes the scene and sets the exposure. If you’re working
in autofocus mode (which I discuss later in “Taking advantage of autofo-
cus”) focus is set at the same time. After the camera makes its decisions,
it signals you in some fashion — usually with a light near the viewfinder
or with a beep.
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
On lower-end cameras, you typically get a choice of two autoexposure 
settings — one appropriate for shooting in very bright light and another for
average lighting. Many cameras display a warning light or refuse to capture
the image if you choose an autoexposure setting that will result in a badly
overexposed or underexposed picture. Higher-priced cameras give you more
control over autoexposure; see the next few sections for more information..
Choosing an autoexposure metering mode
Many cameras offer a choice of autoexposure metering modes. (Check your
manual to find out what buttons or menu commands to use to access the dif-
ferent modes.) In plain English, metering mode refers to the way in which the
camera’s autoexposure mechanism meters — measures — the light in the
scene while calculating the proper exposure for your photograph. The typical
options are as follows:
 Matrix metering: Sometimes known as multizone metering or pattern
metering, this mode divides the frame into a grid (matrix) and analyzes
the light at many different points on the grid. The camera then chooses
an exposure that best captures both shadowed and brightly lit portions
of the scene. This mode is typically the default setting and works well in
most situations.
 Center-weighted metering: When set to this mode, the camera mea-
sures the light in the entire frame but assigns a greater importance —
weight — to the center of the frame. Use this mode when you’re more
concerned about how stuff in the center of your picture looks than stuff
around the edges. (How’s that for technical advice?)
 Spot metering: In this mode, the camera measures the light only at the
center of the frame.
Spot and center-weighted metering are especially helpful when the back-
ground is much brighter or darker than the subject. In matrix metering mode,
your subject may be under- or overexposed because the camera adjusts the
exposure to account for the brightness of the background.
121
Chapter 6: Controlling Exposure and Focus

122
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Figure 6-3 offers an example. In the left image, I shot the picture using matrix
metering. Because the camera saw so much darkness in the frame, it used an
exposure that left the white rose very overexposed — almost no detail
remains in the petals.
Figure 6-3: Try center-weighted or spot metering when your subject is much darker or lighter than the
background.
Changing to spot metering corrected the white rose, but left the red rose too
dark, as shown in the middle image. For this scene, center-weighted metering
produced the best exposure balance. However, if that red rose were out of
the picture, I would prefer the spot-metering exposure because it adds more
depth to the white rose.
You can take advantage of spot or center-weighted metering even if you don’t
want your subject to appear at the center of the picture, by the way. First,
frame the shot with the subject at the center. Press the shutter button
halfway to lock in the exposure and then reframe the picture. As long as you
keep the shutter button halfway down, the camera retains the initial expo-
sure setting.
Of course, when you switch to spot or center-weighted metering, your back-
ground may become too dark or too bright. For other possible solutions, see
the section “Compensating for Backlighting,” later in this chapter. 
Matrix metering
Spot metering
Center-weighted metering
.fa

Keep in mind, too, that you can correct minor lighting and exposure prob-
lems in the photo-editing stage. Generally speaking, making a too-dark image
brighter is easier than correcting an overexposed (too bright) image. So if
you can’t seem to get the exposure just right, opt for a slightly underexposed
image rather than an overexposed one.
Going semi-automatic
In addition to regular autoexposure mode, where the camera sets both aper-
ture and shutter speed, your camera may offer aperture-priority autoexposure
or shutter-priority autoexposure. These options offer more control while still
giving you the benefit of the camera’s exposure brain. Here’s how they work:
 Aperture-priority autoexposure: This mode gives you control over the
aperture. After setting the aperture, you frame your shot and then press
the shutter button halfway to set the focus and exposure, as you do
when using programmed autoexposure mode. But this time, the camera
checks to see what aperture you chose and then selects the shutter
speed necessary to correctly expose the image at that aperture.
By altering the aperture, you change depth of field — the range of sharp
focus. The section “Shifting Depth of Field,” near the end of this chapter,
explores this relationship between aperture and depth of field.
 Shutter-priority autoexposure: In shutter-priority mode, you choose the
shutter speed, and the camera selects the correct aperture.
Theoretically, you should wind up with the same exposure no matter what
aperture or shutter speed you choose, because as you adjust one value,
the camera makes a corresponding change to the other value, right? Well,
yes, sort of. Remember that you’re working with a limited range of shutter
speeds and apertures (your camera manual provides information on avail-
able settings). So depending on the lighting conditions, the camera may not
be able to properly compensate for the shutter speed or aperture that you
choose.
Suppose that you’re shooting outside on a bright, sunny day. You take your
first picture at an aperture of f/11, and the picture looks great. Then you
shoot a second picture, this time choosing an aperture of f/4. The camera
may not be able to set the shutter speed high enough to accommodate the
larger aperture, which means an overexposed picture. (Again, if you’re not
sure what the terms shutter speed and aperture mean, check out Chapter 2.)
123
Chapter 6: Controlling Exposure and Focus

124
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Here’s another example: Say that you’re trying to catch a tennis player in the
act of smashing a ball during a gray, overcast day. You know that you need a
high shutter speed to capture action, so you switch to shutter-priority mode
and set the shutter speed to 1/500 second. But given the dim lighting, the
camera can’t capture enough light even at the largest aperture setting. So
your picture turns out too dark.
As long as you keep the camera’s shutter speed and aperture range in mind,
however, switching to shutter-priority or aperture-priority mode can come in
handy in the following scenarios:
 You’re trying to capture an action scene, and the shutter speed the
camera selects in programmed autoexposure mode is too slow. In
Figure 6-4, for example, a shutter speed of 1/60 second left my jumping
friends blurry. Switching to shutter-priority mode and setting the shutter
speed to 1/300 second caught them cleanly in mid-jump. (Note that the
speed you need to stop action depends on how fast your subject is
moving.)
Figure 6-4: At a slow shutter speed, moving objects appear blurry (left); a faster shutter catches action
cleanly (right).
1/60 second
1/300 second

 You want moving objects to be blurred so that you convey a sense of
motion. When shooting fountains and waterfalls, for example, you can
give the water a misty look by slowing down the shutter, as shown in
Figure 6-5. The shutter speed for the left image was 1/200 second; the
right image, 1/20 second.
 You want to use aperture to control depth of field. Again, see the last
section in this chapter for details on this possibility. (A quick preview:
The larger the aperture, the blurrier the background.)
Any time you use a slow shutter speed, be careful to hold the camera still.
Otherwise, stationary objects and moving objects alike may appear blurry. 
Applying exposure compensation (EV)
Whether you’re working in fully automatic mode or using shutter- or 
aperture-priority mode, you may be able to tweak the exposure by using
exposure compensation, also referred to as EV (exposure value) adjustment.
This control bumps the exposure up or down a few notches from what the
camera’s autoexposure computer thinks is appropriate.
Figure 6-5: A slow shutter speed gives the water a softer, mistier look.
1/200 second
1/20 second
125
Chapter 6: Controlling Exposure and Focus

126
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
How you get to the exposure compensation settings varies from camera to
camera. But you typically choose from settings such as +0.7, +0.3, 0.0, –0.3,
–0.7, and so on, with the 0.0 representing the default autoexposure setting.
Regardless of how you access the EV control, the adjustment works
the same way:
 To produce a brighter image, raise the EV value.
 To produce a darker picture, lower the EV value.
Different cameras provide you with 
different ranges of EV options, and
the extent to which an increase or
decrease in the value affects your image
also varies from camera to camera.
But Figures 6-6 through 6-8 give you an
idea of the impact you can make with
EV compensation.
The image in Figure 6-6 shows the expo-
sure that the camera created when I set
the EV value to 0.0. The two images In
Figure 6-7 show the same shot when I
reduced the exposure by using a nega-
tive EV value. Figure 6-8 shows what hap-
pened when I used positive EV values.
The candle scene points up the benefits
of exposure compensation. I wanted an
exposure dark enough to allow the
candle flame to create a soft glow and to
capture the contrast between the shad-
owed background areas and the bands of
strong afternoon sunshine, which were
coming in through the slats of a wooden
blind. The nonadjusted exposure
(labeled EV 0.0) was just a bit brighter than I had in mind. So I just played
with the EV values until I came up with a mix of shadows and highlights that
suited the subject. For my purposes, I liked the result I obtained with an EV
setting of –0.3.
Don’t forget that if your camera offers a choice of metering modes, you may
want to experiment with changing the metering mode as well as using EV
adjustment. Adjusting the metering mode changes the area of the frame that
the camera considers when making its exposure decision. For the candle
image, I used matrix metering mode, which bases exposure on the entire
frame.

setting produced an image that is a little
too bright for my liking.

Taking Flash Photos
If the techniques in preceding sections don’t deliver a bright enough expo-
sure, you simply have to find a way to bring more light onto your subject.
The obvious choice, of course, is to use a flash.
Most cameras have a built-in flash that operates in several modes. In addition
to automatic mode, in which the camera gauges the available light and fires
the flash if needed, you typically get the following options: fill flash, no flash,
red-eye reduction, and night-time flash (also called slow-sync flash). Higher-
end cameras may allow you to add an external flash unit as well.
The next several sections explain these additional flash options.
Fill flash (or force flash) 
This mode triggers the flash regardless of the light in the scene. Fill-flash
mode is especially helpful for outdoor shots, such as the one in Figure 6-9. I
shot the image on the left using auto-flash mode. Because the picture was
taken on a sunny day, the camera didn’t see the need for a flash. But I did
because the shadow from the hat obscured the subject’s eyes. Switching to
fill-flash mode and forcing the flash to fire threw some additional light on her
face, bringing her eyes into visible range.
Figure 6-9: Adding flash light brings the eyes out from the shadows created by the hat.

No flash
Choose this setting when you don’t want to use the flash, no way, no how.
For example, you may want to use this mode when you’re shooting highly
reflective objects, such as glass or metal, because the flash can cause
blown highlights (areas that are completely white, with no tonal detail).
The upcoming section “Lighting Shiny Objects” offers more help with this
problem.
You may also want to turn off the flash simply because the quality of the
existing light is part of what makes the scene compelling, as is the case in the
candle image in Figure 6-6. The interplay of shadows and light is the interest-
ing aspect of the scene. Turn on the flash, and you have nothing more than a
boring shot of a candle on a hearth.
When you turn off the flash, the camera may reduce the shutter speed to
compensate for the dim lighting. That means that you need to hold the
camera steady for a longer period of time to avoid blurry images. Use a
tripod or otherwise brace the camera for best results.
Flash with red-eye reduction
Anyone who’s taken people pictures with a point-and-shoot camera — digital
or film — is familiar with the so-called red-eye problem. The flash reflects in
the subject’s eyes, and the result is a demonic red glint in the eye. Red-eye
reduction mode aims to thwart this phenomenon by firing a low-power flash
before the “real” flash goes off or by lighting a little lamp for a second or two
prior to capturing the image. The idea is that the prelight, if you will, causes
the iris of the eye to shut down a little, thereby lessening the chances of a
reflection when the final flash goes off.
Unfortunately, red-eye reduction on digital cameras doesn’t work much
better than it does on film cameras. Often, you still wind up with fire in the
eyes — hey, the manufacturer only promised to reduce red eye, not eliminate
it, right? Worse, your subjects sometimes think the preflash or light is the
real flash and start walking away just when the picture is actually being cap-
tured. So if you shoot with red-eye mode turned on, be sure to explain to
your subjects what’s going to happen.
The good news is that, because you’re shooting digitally, you can repair red
eyes easily. Some cameras have an in-camera red-eye remover that you can
apply after you take a picture. If not, the fix is easy to make in a photo-editing
program. Chapter 13 shows you how.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Slow-sync flash
Slow-sync flash, which sometimes also goes by the
name nighttime flash, increases the exposure time
beyond what the camera normally sets for flash
pictures.
With a normal flash, your main subject is illumi-
nated, but background elements beyond the reach
of the flash are dark, as in the top example in Figure
6-10. The longer exposure time provided by slow-
sync flash allows more ambient light to enter the
camera, resulting in a lighter background. I used this
setting for the lower example in Figure 6-10.
Whether a brighter background is desirable
depends upon the subject and your artistic mood.
However, remember that the slower shutter speed
required for slow-sync flash can easily result in a
blurred image; both camera and subject must
remain absolutely still during the entire exposure
to avoid that problem. As a point of reference, the
exposure time for the normal flash example in
Figure 6-10 was 1/60 second, while the slow-sync
exposure time was a full five seconds. In addition,
colors in slow-sync pictures may appear slightly
warmer because of the white-balance issues that
Chapter 5 discusses.
External flash
Higher-end digital models may enable you to use a
separate flash unit with your digital camera. In this
mode, the camera’s on-board flash is disabled, and
you must set the correct exposure to work with
your flash. This option is great for professionals and advanced photo hobby-
ists who have the expertise and equipment to use it; check your camera
manual to find out what type of external flash works with your camera and
how to connect the flash.
If your camera doesn’t offer an accessory off-camera flash connection, you
can get the benefits of an external flash by using so-called “slave” flash units.
These small, self-contained, battery-operated flash units have built-in photo
eyes that trigger the supplemental flash when the camera’s flash goes off. If
you’re trying to photograph an event in a room that’s dimly lit, you can put
several slave units in different places. All the units fire when you take a pic-
ture anywhere in the room.
Figure 6-10: Slow-sync flash
produces a brighter back-
ground than normal flash mode.

Switching on Additional Lights
Although your camera’s flash offers one alternative for lighting your scene,
flash photography isn’t problem-free. When you’re shooting your subject at
close range, a flash can leave some portions of the image overexposed or
even cause blown highlights — areas that are so overexposed that they are
completely white, without any detail. A flash can also lead to red-eyed
people, as all of us know too well.
Some digital cameras can accept an auxiliary flash unit, which helps reduce
blown highlights and red eye because you can move the flash farther away
from the subject. But if your camera doesn’t offer this option, you usually get
better results if you turn off the flash and use another light source to illumi-
nate the scene.
If you’re a well-equipped film photographer and you have studio lights, go dig
them up. Or you may want to invest in some inexpensive photoflood lights —
these are the same kind of lights used with video camcorders and are some-
times called “hot” lights because they “burn” continuously.
But you really don’t need to go out and spend a fortune on lighting equip-
ment. If you get creative, you can probably figure out a lighting solution using
stuff you already have around the house. For example, when shooting small
objects, I sometimes clear off a shelf on the white bookcase in my office. A
nearby window offers a perfect natural light source.
131
Chapter 6: Controlling Exposure and Focus
But it looked good in the LCD!
Your camera’s monitor gives you a good idea of
whether your image is properly exposed. But
don’t rely entirely on the monitor, because it
doesn’t provide an absolutely accurate rendi-
tion of your image. Your actual image may be
brighter or darker than it appears on the moni-
tor, especially if your camera enables you to
adjust the brightness of the monitor display.
To make sure that you get at least one correctly
exposed image, bracket your shots if your
camera offers exposure-adjustment controls.
Bracketing means to record the same scene at
several different exposure settings. Some cam-
eras even offer an automatic bracketing feature
that records multiple images, each at a different
exposure, with one press of the shutter button.

132
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
For shots where I need a little more
space, I sometimes use the setup
shown in Figure 6-11. The white 
background is nothing more than a
cardboard presentation easel pur-
chased at an art and education supply
store — teachers use these things to
create classroom displays. I placed
another white board on the table 
surface.
The easel and board brighten the
subject because they reflect light
onto it. If I need still more light, I
switch on a regular old desk lamp or
a small clip-on shop light (the kind
you buy in hardware stores). And if I
want a colored background instead
of a white one, I clip a piece of col-
ored tissue paper, also bought at that
education supply store, to the easel. Fabric remnants from your local sewing
store provide another source of inexpensive backdrops.
Okay, so professional photographers and serious amateurs may turn up their
noses at these cheap little setups. But I say, whatever works, works. Besides,
you’ve already spent a good sum of money on your camera, so why not save
a few bucks where you can?
When using an artificial light source, whether it’s a true-blue photography
light or a makeshift solution like a desk lamp, you get better results if you
don’t aim the light directly at the object you’re photographing. Instead, aim
the light at the background and let the light bounce off that surface onto your
subject. For example, when using a setup like the one in Figure 6-11, you
might aim the light at one of the side panels. This kind of lighting is called
bounce lighting, in case you’re curious.
If your lighting setup is near a window, keep in mind that sunlight and artifi-
cial lights have different color temperatures, which can fluster your camera’s
white balancing sensor. Do a few test shots, and if your pictures exhibit an
unwanted colorcast, try changing your camera’s white-balance setting.
Alternatively, you can buy some daylight photo flood bulbs to get the color
temperature of your artificial lights more in sync with the daylight shining
through the window. For more details about white balance and color temper-
ature, check out Chapter 5.
Figure 6-11: You can create a makeshift studio
using nothing more than a white presentation
easel, a tripod, and household lamp.

Lighting Shiny Objects
When you shoot shiny objects such as jewelry, glass, chrome, and porcelain,
lighting presents a real dilemma. Any light source that shines directly on the
object can bounce off the surface and cause blown highlights, as shown in
the left image in Figure 6-12. In addition, the light source or other objects in the
room may be reflected in the surface of the object you want to shoot. For the
jewelry shot, the reflections in the crystal earrings also distorted color.
Figure 6-12: Direct lighting creates blown highlights (left); working with a diffused light source
solves the problem (right).
Professional photographers invest in expensive lighting setups to avoid these
problems when shooting product shots like the one in Figure 6-12. If you’re
not in the professional category — or just don’t have a huge budget for outfit-
ting a studio — try these tricks to get decent pictures of shiny stuff:
 Turn off your camera’s built-in flash and find another way to light the
object. A built-in flash creates a strong, focused light source that’s
bound to create problems. See earlier sections in this chapter to find out
how various digital camera features may enable you to get a good expo-
sure without using a flash.
 Find a way to diffuse the lighting. Placing a white curtain or sheet
between the light source and the object not only softens the light and
helps prevent blown highlights, but also prevents unwanted reflections.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
 If you regularly need to photograph reflective objects, you may want
to invest in a product like the Cloud Dome. (See the left photo in Figure
6-13.) You put the objects you want to shoot under the dome and then
attach your camera to a special mount, centering the camera lens over a
hole in the top of the dome. The dome diffuses the light sources and
eliminates reflections. In addition, the mount stabilizes the camera, 
eliminating camera shake that can cause a blurred image.
Cloud Domes start at $200 (www.clouddome.com); you can buy extenders
that allow for shooting taller or wider objects. The price may seem a
little steep at first, but if you do a lot of this type of photography, the
amount of time and frustration it can save is well worth your invest-
ment. Another option is to buy a light tent, which is a little bit like a
teepee made of white cloth. You put your subject inside and then shoot
through a hole in the tent, as shown in the right photo in Figure 6-13.
Light tents come in a wide variety of sizes and prices. The 20-inch diam-
eter tent in Figure 6-13 is from Lastolite (www.lastolite.com) and costs
about $65.

Figure 6-13: Devices like the Cloud Dome (left) and Lastolite light tent (right) make shooting
reflective objects easier.
Compensating for Backlighting
A backlit picture is one in which the sun or light source is behind the subject.
With autoexposure cameras, strong backlighting often results in too-dark sub-
jects because the camera sets the exposure based on the light in the overall
scene, not just on the light falling on the subject. The first image in Figure
6-14 is a classic example of a backlighting problem. I shot this picture at mid-
morning, when the sun was almost directly behind the statue (you can see
the bright light reflected off her shoulders).

Figure 6-14: Backlighting can lead to underexposed subjects (left). Try switching the metering
mode (middle), raising the EV value, adding a flash, or all three (right).
To remedy the situation, you have several options:
 Reposition the subject so that the sun is behind the camera instead of
behind the subject. Unfortunately, this is not an option for immovable
objects like the statue in Figure 6-14.
 Reposition yourself so that you’re shooting from a different angle.
Hmm, again, this is not a solution for this example, assuming you want
to capture the front of the statue.
135
Chapter 6: Controlling Exposure and Focus
Excuse me, can you turn down the sun?
Adding more light to a scene is considerably
easier than reducing the light. If you’re shooting
outdoors, you can’t exactly hit the dimmer switch
on the sun. If the light is too strong, you really
have only a few options. You can move the sub-
ject into the shade (in which case you can use a
fill flash to light the subject), or, on some cameras,
reduce the exposure by lowering the EV value.
If you can’t find a suitable shady backdrop, you
can create one with a piece of cardboard. Just
have a friend hold the cardboard between the
sun and the subject. Voilà — instant shade. By
moving the cardboard around, you can vary the
amount of light that hits the subject.

136
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
 If your camera offers a choice of metering modes, switch to spot
metering or center-weighted metering. (Check out “Choosing a meter-
ing mode,” earlier in this chapter, for information about metering
modes.) For the middle example in Figure 6-14, I set the camera to spot
metering mode. The image is improved, but the statue is still a little
underexposed.
 On cameras that don’t offer spot or center-weighted metering, mean-
ing that the camera considers the light throughout the frame when set-
ting the exposure, try to “fool” the autoexposure meter. Fill the frame
with a dark object, press the shutter button halfway to lock in the expo-
sure, reframe the subject, and press the shutter button the rest of the
way to take the picture.
If you’re working in autofocus mode, the focus is also set when you
press the shutter button halfway. So be sure that the dark object you
use to set the exposure is the same distance from the camera as your
real subject. Otherwise, the focus of the picture will be off.
 Raise the EV value. See the section “Applying exposure compensation
(EV),” earlier in this chapter, for information about this technique.
 Use a flash. Adding the flash can bring subjects out of the shadows.
However, because the working range of the flash on most consumer digi-
tal cameras is relatively small, your subject must be fairly close to the
camera for the flash to do any good.
To produce the well-exposed statue image on the right in Figure 6-14, I
switched to spot metering, bumped the EV value up to +0.3, and added a
flash. Note that on a bright day, the flash may also add a warmer tone to your
scene, as here, due to the white-balancing issue explained in Chapter 5. The
camera sets the white balance to compensate for the color of flash light,
which is cooler (bluer) than sunny light.
Focus on Focus
Like point-and-shoot film cameras, digital cameras for the consumer market
provide focusing aids to help you capture sharp images with ease. The fol-
lowing sections describe the different types of focusing schemes available
and how you can make the most of them.
Working with fixed-focus cameras
Fixed-focus cameras are just that — the focus is set at the factory and
can’t be changed. The camera is designed to capture sharply any subject
within a certain distance from the lens. Subjects outside that range appear
blurry.

Fixed-focus cameras sometimes are called focus-free cameras because you’re
free of the chore of setting the focus before you shoot. But this term is a mis-
nomer, because even though you can’t adjust the focus, you have to remem-
ber to keep the subject within the camera’s focusing range. There is no such
thing as a (focus) free lunch.
Be sure to check your camera manual to find out how much distance to put
between your camera and your subject. With fixed-focus cameras, blurry
images usually result from having your subject too close to the camera.
(Most fixed-focus cameras are engineered to focus sharply from a few feet
away from the camera to infinity.)
Taking advantage of autofocus
Most digital cameras offer autofocus, which means that the camera automati-
cally adjusts the focus after measuring the distance between lens and sub-
ject. But “autofocusing” isn’t totally automatic. For autofocus to work, you
need to lock in the focus before you shoot the picture, as follows:
1. Frame the picture.
2. Press the shutter button halfway and hold it there.
Your camera analyzes the picture and sets the focus. If your camera
offers autoexposure — as most do — the exposure is set at the same
time. After locking in exposure and focus, the camera lets you know that
you can proceed with the picture. Usually, a little light blinks near the
viewfinder or the camera makes a beeping noise.
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
Although autofocus is a great photography tool, you need to understand a
few things about how your camera goes about its focusing work in order to
take full advantage of this feature. Here’s the condensed version of the auto-
focusing manual:
 Autofocus mechanisms fall into one of two main categories:
• Single-spot focus: With this type of autofocus, the camera reads
the distance of the element that’s at the center of the frame in
order to set the focus.
• Multi-spot focus: The camera measures the distance at several spots
around the frame and sets focus relative to the nearest object.
You need to know how your camera adjusts focus so that when you lock
in the focus (using the press-and-hold method just described), you place
the subject within the area that the autofocus mechanism reads. If the
camera uses single-spot focusing, for example, you should place your
subject in the center of the frame when locking the focus. Some cameras
enable you to choose which type of focusing you want to use for a par-
ticular shot; check your camera manual for details.
137
Chapter 6: Controlling Exposure and Focus

138
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
 If your camera offers single-spot focus, you may see little framing marks
in the viewfinder that indicate the focus point. Check your camera
manual to see what the different viewfinder marks mean. On some cam-
eras, the marks are provided to help you frame the picture rather than
as a focusing indicator. (See the section “A Parallax! A Parallax!,” in the
next chapter, for more information.)
 After you lock in the focus, you can reframe your picture if you want. As
long as you keep the shutter button halfway down, the focus remains
locked. Be careful that the distance between the camera and the subject
doesn’t change, or your focus will be off.
 Some cameras that offer autofocus also provide you with one or two
manual-focus adjustments. Your camera may offer a macro mode for
close-up shooting and an infinity lock or landscape focusing mode for
shooting subjects at a distance, for example. When you switch to
these modes, autofocusing may be turned off, so you need to make
sure that your subject falls within the focusing range of the selected
mode. Check your camera’s manual to find out the proper camera-to-
subject distance.
Hold that thing still!
A blurry image isn’t always the result of poor
focusing; you can also get fuzzy shots if you
move the camera during the time the image is
being captured.
Holding the camera still is essential in any
shooting situation, but it becomes especially
important when the light is dim because a
longer exposure time is needed. That means
that you have to keep the camera steady longer
than you do when shooting in bright light.
To help keep the camera still, try these tricks:
 Press your elbows against your sides as
you snap the picture.
 Squeeze, don’t jab, the shutter button. Use a
soft touch to minimize the chance of moving
the camera when you press the shutter
button.
 Place the camera on a countertop, table, or
other still surface. Better yet, use a tripod.
You can pick up an inexpensive tripod for
about $20.
 If your camera offers a self-timer feature,
you can opt for hands-free shooting to elim-
inate any possibility of camera shake. Place
the camera on a tripod (or other still surface),
set the camera to self-timer mode, and then
press the shutter button (or do whatever
your manual says to activate the self-timer
mechanism). Then move away from the
camera. After a few seconds, the camera
snaps the picture for you automatically.
Of course, if you’re lucky enough to own a
camera that offers remote-control shooting,
you can take advantage of that feature
instead of the self-timer mode.

Focusing manually
On most consumer digital cameras, you get either no manual-focusing options
or just one or two options in addition to autofocus. You may be able to choose
a special focus setting for close-up shooting and one for faraway subjects.
But a few high-end cameras offer more extensive manual focusing controls.
Although some models offer a traditional focusing mechanism where you
twist the lens barrel to set the focus, most cameras require you to use menu
controls to select the distance at which you want the camera to focus.
The ability to set the focus at a specific distance from the camera comes in
handy when you want to shoot several pictures of one, nonmoving subject.
By setting the focus manually, you don’t have to go to the trouble of locking
in the autofocus for each shot. Just be sure that you’ve accurately gauged the
distance between camera and subject when setting the manual-focus distance.
If you’re using manual focus for close-up shooting, get out a ruler and make
sure that you have the correct camera-to-subject distance. You can’t get a
good idea of whether the focus is dead-on from the viewfinder or LCD, and
being just an inch off in your focus judgment can mean a blurry picture.
Shifting Depth of Field
If you’re an experienced photographer, you probably know that one aspect of
focus — depth of field — is controlled in part by the aperture setting. Depth
of field refers to how much of an image is in sharp focus. The larger the depth
of field, the greater the zone of sharp focus. (Note that zooming in on a sub-
ject also changes the depth of field; for more about this issue, see Chapter 7.)
Figure 6-15 shows an example of how aperture affects depth of field. For both
pictures, I used the camera’s macro focusing mode. But I shot the left image
with an aperture setting of f/3.4 and the right image with an aperture of f/11. 
In the left image, only objects very close to the front tulip are sharply
focused — in other words, the picture has a short depth of field. Reducing
the aperture increased the depth of field, bringing more surrounding flowers
into focus. (Remember, a higher f-stop number means a smaller aperture.)
If your digital camera doesn’t offer aperture control or a zoom lens, you can
use your photo editor’s blur filters to create the effect of a short depth of field
in an existing picture. Chapter 11 shows you how. You may also have access
to scene modes, explained next, which automatically vary the aperture.

Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Figure 6-15: An aperture setting of f/3.4 (left) results in a blurrier background than a setting of f/11 (right). 
Taking Advantage of Scene Modes
When you’re first getting into photography, remembering all the rules about
ISO, shutter speed, aperture, and focus can be a pain at best — and nigh on
impossible at worst. That’s why many cameras now offer scene modes. These
special picture-taking modes are designed to automatically flip all the avail-
able focus and exposure controls to settings that are appropriate for different
types of subject matter.
For example, your camera may offer a Portrait scene mode. Because most
people prefer the backgrounds in portraits to be slightly out of focus, Portrait
mode automatically dials in a larger aperture, which reduces depth of field.
(See the preceding section for more about depth of field.) 
Table 6-1 lists the four standard scene modes and gives you an idea of how
each one affects your picture. Check your manual to find out whether your
camera offers these features; chances are, you may even have additional
modes to make other types of picture-taking easier.

Table 6-1
Automatic Scene Modes
Mode
What It Does
Portrait
Uses the largest aperture, which shortens depth of field
and creates a blurrier background. The camera may
choose a faster shutter speed to compensate for the
larger aperture. 
Landscape
Selects the smallest possible aperture to ensure the
greatest depth of field. Use this mode when you want as
much of the scene as possible to be in sharp focus. The
camera may choose a slower shutter speed to compen-
sate, requiring you to hold the camera steady longer. This
mode may also set the focusing mechanism to landscape
mode.
Action
Selects a fast shutter speed to capture moving objects
without blurring. The camera may open the aperture wider
to compensate for the faster shutter, decreasing depth of
field.
Nighttime
Use flash in combination with a slow shutter so that pic-
ture backgrounds are brighter. Don’t use this mode if you
want the background to be dark.

C
hapters 5 and 6 emphasize the science of digital photography, explaining
technical issues such as resolution, aperture, shutter speed, and so on.
But photography is as much art as it is science. After all, a boring image is a
boring image, no matter how technically perfect. 
This chapter offers some suggestions that can help you take
more memorable, captivating photographs. Whether
you’re snapping pics of your children or shooting prod-
uct images for your company’s sales brochure, experi-
ment with these techniques. As you’ll discover, a little
planning and creativity is all you need to evolve from
a so-so picture taker to a creative, knock-their-socks-
off photographer.
Composition 101
Consider the image in Figure 7-1. Exposure, focus, and
the other technical aspects of the picture are fine. And the
subject, a statue at the base of the Soldiers and Sailors
Monument in Indianapolis, is interesting enough. But overall, the
picture is . . . well, dull as dishwater. In fact, with all the new scented dish-
washing liquids out there, I think dishwater might even be more intriguing.

144
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Now look at Figure 7-2, which shows
two additional images of the same 
subject, but with more powerful
results. What makes the difference? 
In a word, composition. Simply fram-
ing the statue differently, zooming in
for a closer view, and changing the
camera angle create more captivating
images.
Not everyone agrees on the “best”
ways to compose an image — art being
in the eye of the beholder and all that.
For every composition rule, you can
find an incredible image that proves
the exception. That said, the following
list offers some suggestions that can
help you create images that rise above
the ho-hum mark on the visual interest
meter:
Figure 7-2: Getting closer to the subject and shooting from less-obvious angles result in more-
interesting pictures.
Figure 7-1: This image falls flat because of
its uninspired framing and angle of view.

 Remember the rule of thirds.
For maximum impact, don’t
place your subject smack in the
center of the frame, as I did in
Figure 7-1. Instead, mentally
divide the image area into thirds,
as illustrated in Figure 7-3. Then
position the main subject ele-
ments at spots where the dividing
lines intersect. In the sample
image, the point of interest, the
deer’s eye and nose, fall at that
placement.
This deer, fortunately, was so
engrossed in nibbling the foliage
that I had time to frame the shot
well. But if you don’t have that
luxury, frame the shot loosely,
including a good margin of back-
ground around the subject.
Then you can crop the image
to a better composition in your
photo editor. Chapter 11 shows
you how.
 Shoot from unexpected angles.
Again, refer to Figure 7-1. This
image accurately represents the
statue. But the picture is hardly
as captivating as the images
in Figure 7-2, which show the
same subject from more unusual
angles.
 Draw the eye across the frame.
To add life to your images, 
compose the scene so that the
viewer’s eye is naturally led
from one edge of the frame to
the other, as in Figure 7-4. The
figure in the image, also part
of the Soldiers and Sailors
Monument, appears ready to fly
off into the big, blue yonder. You
can almost feel the breeze blow-
ing the torch’s flame and the
figure’s cape.
145
Chapter 7: Take Your Best Shot
Figure 7-3: One rule of composition is to divide
the frame into thirds and position the main
subject at one of the intersection points.
Figure 7-4: To add life to your pictures, frame
the scene so that the eye is naturally drawn
from one edge of the image to the other.

146
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
 Get close to your subject. Often, the
most interesting shot is the one that
reveals the small details, such as the
laugh lines in a grandfather’s face or the
raindrop on the rose petal. Don’t be
afraid to fill the frame with your sub-
ject, either. The old rule about “head
room” — providing a nice margin of
space above and to the sides of a sub-
ject’s head — is a rule meant to be
broken on occasion.
 Pay attention to the background. Before
taking a picture, do a quick scan of the
background, looking for distracting back-
ground elements such as the flower and
computer monitor in Figure 7-5.
Here’s a trick for capturing children
against a noninvasive backdrop:
Photograph them while they’re lying
down on the floor and looking up at the camera,
as in Figure 7-6. Rooms full of children also tend
to be full of toys, sippy cups, and other kid para-
phernalia, which can make getting an uncluttered
shot difficult. So I simply shove everything off a
small area of carpet and have the kids get down
on the floor and pose.
 Try to capture the subject’s personality. The
most boring people shots are those in which the
subjects stand in front of the camera and say
“cheese” on the photographer’s cue. If you really
want to reveal something about your subjects,
catch them in the act of enjoying a favorite hobby
or using the tools of their trade. This tactic is
especially helpful with subjects who are camera-
shy; focusing their attention on a familiar activity
helps put them at ease and replace that stiff, I’d-rather-be-anywhere-but-
here look with a more natural expression.
A Parallax! A Parallax!
You compose your photo perfectly. The light is fine, the focus is fine, and all
other photographic planets appear to be in alignment. But after you snap
your picture and view the image on the camera monitor, the framing is off, as
though your subject repositioned itself while you weren’t looking.
Figure 7-5: A beautiful subject set
against a horrendous background.
Figure 7-6: To avoid clutter,
have kids lie on an empty
swatch of carpet.

You’re not the victim of some cruel digital hoax — just a photographic phe-
nomenon known as a parallax error.
On many digital cameras, as on most point-and-shoot film cameras, the
viewfinder looks out on the world through a separate window from the
camera lens. Because the viewfinder is located an inch or so above or to the
side of the lens, it sees your subject from a slightly different angle than the
lens. But the image is captured from the point of view of the lens, not the
viewfinder.
When you look through your
viewfinder, you may see some lines
near the corners of the frame. The
lines indicate the boundaries of the
frame as seen by the camera lens.
Pay attention to these framing cues,
or you may wind up with pictures
that appear to have been lopped off
along one edge, as in Figure 7-7.
The closer you are to your subject,
the bigger the parallax problem
becomes, whether you use a zoom
lens or simply position the camera
lens nearer to your subject. Some
cameras provide a second set of
framing marks in the viewfinder to indicate the framing boundaries that apply
when you’re shooting close-up shots. Check your camera manual to deter-
mine which framing marks mean what. (Some markings have to do with
focusing, not framing.)
If your camera has an LCD monitor, you have an additional aid for avoiding
parallax problems. Because the monitor reflects the image as seen by the
lens, you can simply use the monitor instead of the viewfinder to frame your
image. On some cameras, the LCD monitor turns on automatically when you
switch to macro mode for close-up shooting.
Composing for Compositing
For the most part, the rules of digital image composition are the same rules
that film photographers have followed for years. But when you’re creating
digital images, you need to consider an additional factor: how you want to
use the image. If you want to lift part of your picture out of its background —
for example, in order to paste the subject into another image — pay special
attention to the background and framing of the image.
147
Chapter 7: Take Your Best Shot
Figure 7-7: My pal Bernie loses his ears as the
result of a parallax error.

148
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Digital-imaging gurus refer to the process of combining two images as 
compositing.
Suppose that you’re creating a product brochure and you want to create a
photo montage that combines images of four products. To make life easier in
the photo-editing stage, shoot each product against a plain background. That
way, you can easily separate the product from the background when you’re
ready to cut and paste the product image into your montage.
As I explain in Chapter 12, you must select an element in your photo editor
before you can lift it out of its background and paste it into another picture.
Selecting simply draws an outline around the element so that the computer
knows which pixels to cut and paste. So why does shooting your subject
against a plain background make the job easier? Because most photo editors
offer a tool that enables you to click a color in your image to automatically
select surrounding areas that are similarly colored. If you shoot your subject
against a red backdrop, for example, you can select the background by click-
ing a red background pixel. You then can invert (reverse) the selection to
easily select the subject.
Figures 7-8 and 7-9 offer an example.
The vintage fabric used as a back-
ground in Figure 7-8 makes artistic
sense, given that the subject is a 
vintage camera. But because little 
contrast exists between the edges of
the camera and the background, you
lose the automatic selection option.
Instead, you have to draw your selec-
tion outline manually by tracing around
the camera.
Again, you can find complete details
about selecting in Chapter 12 and read
about building a collage in Chapter 13.
For now, just remember that if you want
to separate an object from its background in the editing stage, shoot
the object against a plain background, as in Figure 7-9. Make sure that the
background color is distinct from the colors around the perimeter of the 
subject, not the interior, if you have a multicolor subject, such as the 
camera.
Figure 7-8: Avoid busy backgrounds such
as this one when shooting objects that you
plan to use in a photo collage.

Another important rule of shooting
images for compositing is to fill as
much of the frame as possible with
your subject, as I did in Figure 7-9.
That way, you devote the maximum
number of pixels to your subject, rather
than wasting them on a background
that you’re going to trim away. The
more pixels you have, the larger the
prints you can make. (See Chapter 2 for
more information on this law of digital
imaging.)
Zooming In without 
Losing Out
Many digital cameras offer zoom lenses that enable you to get a close-up 
perspective on your subject without going to the bother of actually moving
toward the subject.
Some cameras provide an optical zoom, which is a true zoom lens, just like
the one you may have on your film camera. Other cameras offer a digital
zoom, which isn’t a zoom lens at all but a bit of pixel sleight of hand. The next
two sections offer some guidelines for working with both types of zooms.
Shooting with an optical (real) zoom
If your camera has an optical zoom, keep these tips in mind before you trig-
ger that zoom button or switch:
 The closer you get to your subject, the greater the chance of a parallax
error, discussed earlier in this chapter. 
 When you zoom in on a subject, you can fit less of the background into
the frame than if you zoom out and get your close-up shot by moving
nearer to the subject, as illustrated by Figure 7-10. This choice is entirely
subjective, by the way. If you want more background in the frame, zoom
out and walk closer to your subject; if not, walk away and zoom in. For
this portrait example, zooming was the right thing to do because it elimi-
nates the distracting background elements you see in the right photo.
149
Chapter 7: Take Your Best Shot
Figure 7-9: Shoot elements against a plain
background and fill as much of the frame as
possible.

150
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Figure 7-10: Zooming in on a subject (left) means less background in the frame than zooming out and moving
closer to the subject (right).
 Zooming to a telephoto setting also tends to make the background blur-
rier than if you shoot close to the subject. This happens because the
depth of field changes when you zoom. Introduced in Chapter 6, depth
of field simply refers to the zone of sharp focus in your photo. With a
short depth of field — which is what you get when you’re zoomed in —
elements that are close to the camera are sharply focused, but distant
background elements are not. When you zoom to a wide-angle lens set-
ting, you have a greater depth of field, so faraway objects may be as
sharply focused as your main subject. Notice that the bricks in the zoom
example in Figure 7-10 are much less sharply focused than those in the
right image.
Keep in mind that varying the camera’s aperture setting also affects
depth of field. See the last section in Chapter 6 for details. For Figure
7-10, the aperture was the same for both shots so that the change in
depth of field occurred only as a result of zooming.

Using a digital zoom
Some cameras put a new twist on zooming, providing a digital zoom rather
than an optical zoom. With digital zoom, the camera enlarges the elements at
the center of the frame to create the appearance that you’ve zoomed in.
Say that you want to take a picture of a boat that’s bobbing in the middle of a
lake. You decide to zoom in on the boat and lose the watery surroundings.
The camera crops out the lake pixels and magnifies the boat pixels to fill the
frame. The end result is no different than if you had captured both boat and
lake, cropped the lake away in your photo software, and then enlarged the
remaining boat image. Any time you enlarge a photo significantly, you run the
risk of reducing picture quality. (See Chapter 2 to find out why.) In addition, a
digital zoom doesn’t produce the same change in depth of field as an optical
zoom. 
For the most part, this feature is more marketing gimmick than anything else.
However, digital zoom — which is really in-camera cropping — may come in
handy if you want to print directly from your camera memory card and won’t
have the opportunity (or desire) to do the cropping yourself on your computer.
Catching a Moving Target
Capturing action with most point-and-shoot cameras, digital or film, isn’t an
easy proposition. If your subject is moving very rapidly, your camera may not
offer shutter speeds high enough to “stop” action — that is, to record a non-
blurry image of a moving target. (See Chapter 6 for help with manipulating
shutter speeds.)
Compounding the problem, the camera needs a few seconds to establish the
autofocus and autoexposure settings before you shoot, plus a few seconds
after you shoot to process and store the image in memory. If you’re shooting
with a flash, you also must give the flash a few seconds to recycle between
pictures.
Some cameras offer a rapid-fire option, usually known as burst mode or contin-
uous capture mode, that enables you to shoot a series of images with one
press of the shutter button. The camera takes pictures at timed intervals as
long as you keep the shutter button pressed. This feature eliminates some of
the lag time that occurs from the moment you press the shutter button until
the time you can take another picture. I used burst mode to record the series
of images in Figure 7-11.
151
Chapter 7: Take Your Best Shot

152
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Figure 7-11: Burst mode enables you to shoot a moving target. Here, a capture 
setting of three frames per second broke a golfer’s swing into five stages.

If your camera offers burst-mode shooting, check to find out whether you can
adjust the settings to capture more or fewer images within a set period of
time. To capture the images in Figure 7-11, for example, I set the camera to its
fastest burst mode, three frames per second.
Keep in mind that most cameras can shoot only low- or medium-resolution
pictures in burst mode (high-resolution pictures would require a longer stor-
age time). And the flash is typically disabled for this capture mode. More
importantly, though, timing the shots so that you catch the height of the
action is difficult. Notice that in Figure 7-11, I didn’t capture the most impor-
tant moment in the swing — the point at which the club makes contact with
the ball! If you’re interested in recording just one particular moment, you may
be better off using a regular shooting mode so that you have better control
over when each picture is taken.
When you’re shooting action shots “the normal way” — that is, without the
help of burst mode — use these tricks to do a better job of stopping a moving
subject in its tracks:
 Lock in focus and exposure in advance. Press the shutter button
halfway to initiate the autofocus and autoexposure process (if your
camera offers these features) well ahead of the time when you want to
capture the image. That way, when the action happens, you don’t have
to wait for the focus and exposure to be set. When locking in the focus
and exposure, aim the camera at an object or person approximately the
same distance away and in the same lighting conditions as your final
subject will be. See Chapter 6 for more information about locking in
focus and exposure.
 Anticipate the shot. With just about any camera, a slight delay occurs
between the time you press the shutter button and the time the camera
actually records the image. So the trick to catching action is to press the
shutter button just a split second before the action occurs. Practice
shooting with your camera until you have a feel for how far in advance
you need to press that shutter button.
 Turn on the flash. Even if it’s daylight, turning on the flash sometimes
causes the camera to select a higher shutter speed, thereby freezing
action better. To make sure that the flash is activated, use the fill-flash
mode (check out Chapter 6), rather than auto-flash mode. Remember,
though, that the flash may need time to recycle between shots. So for
taking a series of action shots, you may want to turn the flash off.
 Switch to shutter-priority autoexposure mode (if available). Then
select the highest shutter speed the camera provides and take a test
shot. If the picture is too dark, lower the shutter speed a notch and
retest. Remember, in shutter-priority mode, the camera reads the light in
the scene and then sets the aperture as needed to properly expose the
image at the shutter speed you select. So if the lighting isn’t great, you
may not be able to set the shutter speed high enough to stop action. For
more about this issue, see Chapter 6.
153
Chapter 7: Take Your Best Shot

154
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
If your camera doesn’t offer shutter-priority autoexposure (or manual
shutter and aperture control), it may provide a sports or action scene
mode that increases shutter speed. Check your manual for information.
 Use a lower capture resolution. The lower the capture resolution, the
smaller the image file, and the less time the camera needs to record the
image to memory. That means that you can take a second shot sooner
than if you captured a high-resolution image.
 Turn off automatic playback. If your camera offers an “instant review”
feature that automatically displays a picture on the LCD monitor for a
few seconds after you shoot the image, turn off the feature. When it’s on,
the camera likely won’t let you take another picture during the review
period.
 Make sure that your camera batteries are fresh. Weak batteries can
sometimes make your camera behave sluggishly.
 Keep the camera turned on. Because digital cameras suck up battery
juice like nobody’s business, the natural tendency is to turn off your
camera between shots. But most cameras take a few seconds to warm
up after you turn them on — during which time, whatever it was that
you were trying to record may have come and gone. Do turn the LCD
monitor off, though, to conserve battery power.
Shooting Pieces of a Panoramic Quilt
You’re standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon, awestruck by the colors,
light, and majestic rock formations. “If only I could capture all this in a photo-
graph!” you think. But when you view the scene through your camera’s
viewfinder, you quickly realize that you can’t possibly do justice to such a
magnificent landscape with one ordinary picture.
Wait — don’t put down that camera and head for the souvenir shack just yet.
When you’re shooting digitally, you don’t have to try to squeeze the entire
canyon — or whatever other subject inspires you — into one frame. You can
shoot several frames, each featuring a different part of the scene, and then
stitch them together just as you would sew together pieces of a patchwork
quilt. Figure 7-12 shows two images of a historic farmhouse that I stitched
together into the panorama shown in Figure 7-13.
Although you could conceivably combine photos into a panorama using your
photo-editor’s regular cut-and-paste editing tools, a dedicated stitching tool
makes the job easier. You simply pull up the images you want to join, and the
program assists you in stitching the digital “seam.”

Figure 7-12: I stitched together these two images to create the panorama in Figure 7-13.
Figure 7-13: The resulting panorama provides a larger perspective on the farmhouse scene.
Some camera manufacturers provide proprietary stitching tools as part of
the camera’s software bundle. In addition, many photo-editing programs offer
a stitching tool; Figure 7-14 shows the version provided in Photoshop
Elements. You also can buy stand-alone stitching programs such as ArcSoft
Panorama Maker ($40, www.arcsoft.com).
155
Chapter 7: Take Your Best Shot

156
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Figure 7-14: Photoshop Elements offers a panorama tool that helps you stitch images together.
The stitching process is easy if you shoot the original images correctly. If you
don’t, you wind up with something that looks more like a crazy quilt than a
seamless photographic panorama. Here’s what you need to know:
 Capture each picture using the same camera-to-subject distance and
camera height. If you’re shooting a wide building, don’t get closer to the
building at one end than you do at another, for example, or raise the
camera for one shot in the series.
 Overlap each shot by at least 30 percent. Say that you’re shooting a
line of ten cars. If image one includes the first three cars in the line,
image two should include the third car as well as cars four and five.
Some cameras provide a panorama mode that displays a portion of the
previous shot in the monitor so that you can see where to align the next
shot in the series. If your camera doesn’t offer this feature, you need to
make a mental note of where each picture ends so that you know where
the next picture should begin.

 Maintain the right axis of rotation. As you pan the camera to capture
the different shots in the panorama, imagine that the camera is perched
atop a short flagpole, with the camera’s lens aligned with the pole. Be
sure to use that same alignment as you take each shot. If you don’t, you
can’t successfully join the images later. For best results, use a tripod.
 Keep the camera level. Some tripods include little bubble levels that
help you keep the camera on an even keel. If you don’t have this kind of
tripod, you may want to buy a little stick-on level at the hardware store
and put it on top of your camera.
 Use a consistent focusing approach. If you lock the focus on the fore-
ground in one shot, don’t focus on the background in the next shot.
 Check your camera manual to find out whether your camera offers an
exposure lock function. This feature retains a consistent exposure
throughout the series of panorama shots, which is important for seam-
less image stitching.
If your camera doesn’t provide a way to override autoexposure, you may
need to fool the camera into using a consistent exposure. Say that one
half of a scene is in the shadows and the other is in the sunlight. With
autoexposure enabled, the camera increases the exposure for the shad-
owed area and decreases the exposure for the sunny area. That sounds
like a good thing, but what it really does is create a noticeable color shift
between the two halves of the picture. To prevent this problem, lock in
the focus and exposure on the same point for each shot. Choose a point
of medium brightness for best results.
 Avoid including moving objects in the shot. If possible, wait for
bypassers to get out of the frame before you take each picture. If some-
one is walking across the landscape as you shoot, you may wind up with
the same strolling figure appearing at several spots in the stitched
panorama. Ditto for cars, bicycles, and other moving objects. 
If you really enjoy creating panorama images or need to do so regularly for
business purposes, you can make your life a little easier by investing in a spe-
cial panoramic tripod head, which helps you make sure that each shot is per-
fectly set up to create a seamless panorama. Manufacturers of these specialty
tripods include Manfrotto (www.manfrotto.com) and Kaidan (www.kaidan.com).
Expect to pay several hundred dollars for these specialty devices.
Avoiding the Digital Measles
Are your images coming out of your camera looking a little blotchy or dotted
with colored speckles, like those you see in Figure 7-15? Or do some parts of
the image have a jagged appearance?
157
Chapter 7: Take Your Best Shot

158
Part II: Ready, Set, Shoot! 
Figure 7-15: Low lighting can result in grainy images.
If your images suffer from these defects, try these remedies:
 Use a lower JPEG compression setting. Jaggedy or blotchy images are
often the result of too much JPEG compression, a topic that you can
explore in Chapter 5. Check your camera manual to find out how to
choose a lower compression setting.
 Raise the resolution. Too few pixels can mean blocky-looking — or 
pixelated — images. The larger you print the photo, the worse the 
problem becomes. (See Chapter 2 for information on why low resolu-
tion translates to poor print quality.)
 Increase the lighting. Photos shot in very low light often take on a
grainy appearance, like the one in Figure 7-15. Unfortunately, you can’t
really throw a spotlight on a skyline scene like this one, but if you’re
shooting smaller, closer subjects, adding flash or other light sources 
is a good notion.
 Lower the camera’s ISO setting (if possible). Typically, the higher the
ISO, the grainier the image. For more on this issue, check out Chapter 6.

F
or most people, the picture-taking part of digital photography isn’t all
that perplexing — the process is pretty much the same as shooting with
a film camera, after all. Where the confusion arises is the step of getting pic-
tures from the camera to the computer, especially for people who don’t have
much computer experience.
This chapter sorts out the mysteries of this part of the digital
photography routine, showing you the fastest and easiest
ways to transfer pictures to your computer. Look here, too,
for details on how to work with pictures taken in the
Camera Raw format and for tips on how to organize
your picture files. (Chapter 4 discusses the best ways
to archive your files once they’re on your computer.)
If you are a computer novice, I encourage you to
also pick up a copy of the appropriate For Dummies
book for your Windows or Mac operating system.
Although I try to provide enough information to get
you started, this book doesn’t have enough room to
cover all the nuts and bolts of working with various oper-
ating systems. And without a good grip on computer basics,
your digital photography experience will be more frustrating
and less enjoyable than it should be.

162
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Downloading Your Images
You have a camera full of pictures. Now what? You transfer them to your com-
puter, that’s what. The following sections introduce you to several methods
of doing so.
Some digital photography aficionados refer to the process of moving photos
from the camera to the computer as downloading.
A trio of downloading options
Digital camera manufacturers have developed several ways for users to 
transfer pictures from camera to computer. You may or may not be able to
use all these options, depending on your camera. The following list offers a
brief overview of the various transfer methods, beginning with the fastest
and easiest choice:
 Memory card transfer: If you own a Sony digital camera that stores images
on a floppy disk, just pop the disk out of your camera and insert it into
the floppy drive on your computer (assuming that your computer has
said drive). Then copy the images to your hard drive as you do regular
data files on a floppy disk.
If your camera uses some other type of removable storage media, you
can also enjoy the convenience of transferring images directly from
that media, provided you have a matching card reader or adapter. See
Chapter 4 for more information on these gadgets.
 Cable transfer: You can also connect your computer directly to your
camera using the cable that came in your camera box. If your camera is
an older model, the connection may be via a serial cable, which trans-
fers data at a speed roughly equivalent to a turtle pulling a 2-ton pickup.
Okay, so maybe the speed isn’t quite that slow — it just seems that way.
Fortunately, newer cameras connect to the computer via a USB port,
which makes the transfer process faster.
 Wireless transfer: A few cameras offer wireless transfer, taking advantage
of the same technologies employed by wireless Internet connections,
television remote controls, and other wireless devices. In order to take
advantage of this feature, both your camera and computer must have
the right wireless equipment.
You can find more details on memory-card transfer and camera-to-computer
transfer in the next several sections. Because setting up wireless transfer
varies depending on the specific wireless technology, camera, and computer,

I must refer you to your camera manual for help with that process. Note that
the speed at which your image files travel through the air depends on the
type of wireless connection; you may find that one of the other two transfer
options gets the job done more quickly.
The software provided with some cameras and card readers includes an auto-
mated feature that’s designed to help you with the transfer process. As soon
as you put a card in the reader slot or connect the camera, a screen may pop
up with instructions that guide you through the steps of moving or copying
files to your computer. Some photo-editing software also launches automati-
cally whenever it detects a camera or card. For example, Figure 8-1 shows the
window you see whenever Photoshop Elements notices that image files are
knocking at your computer’s door.
These utilities all work differently, so consult the reader or software manual
to see what’s what. If you don’t want the utility to launch automatically, you
should be able to turn that feature off via the program’s options or prefer-
ences menu. You can then follow the steps I outline in the upcoming sections
to transfer your files from the camera or card.
Figure 8-1: Elements automatically launches this transfer utility whenever it detects the
presence of a camera or memory card.
163
Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse

164
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Using a card reader or adapter
Before you can transfer photos using a card reader, you must first hook up
the reader to your computer and install any software that shipped with the
reader. Pay close attention to the installation instructions; it’s important to
make the connection and install the software in the exact order the manufac-
turer specifies.
After installing the card reader, just put your memory card into the appropriate
slot on the reader, as shown in Figure 8-2. The computer should then recognize
the card, and you can access the picture files it contains as you would any files
already on your hard drive.
Figure 8-2: Just push the memory card into the matching slot on the card reader.
As an example, Figure 8-3 shows how a card reader I use shows up in Windows
Explorer. This reader has four slots, so Explorer lists four drives, each with its
own drive letter. In the figure, Drive I is the one that currently holds a memory
card. As shown in the figure, you have to open a folder or two to get to the
actual image files — they’re typically housed inside a folder named DCIM
(for digital camera images).
On a Mac, the card should appear as a drive on the desktop, similar to what
happens when you put a CD into the CD drive. Double-click the drive icon to
access the card contents. (The upcoming Figure 8-8 offers an illustration.)

Figure 8-3: The memory card appears as a regular drive on the computer.
After opening the folder that contains the images, select the ones you want
to transfer and then just drag them to the folder on your hard drive (or other
location) where you want to store them, as shown in Figure 8-4. The little plus
sign next to your cursor indicates that you’re placing a copy of the files on
the memory card into the new storage bin; your originals remain on the card.
When you’re sure that the files made it to their new home, you can put the
card back into the camera to erase the originals.
This same process works whether you’re moving files from a dedicated card
reader or from memory-card slots provided on a printer, by the way. And you
use the same technique if you’re using a memory-card adapter instead of a
card reader.

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Figure 8-4: After selecting the pictures you want to transfer, just drag them to their new home.
Also, you don’t necessarily need to use Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder
as the gateway for accessing your files. You typically can download files from
within your photo-cataloging or photo-editing program, too.
Cable transfer how-to’s
Before you connect your camera to the computer for the first time, you may
need to install some software that came with the camera. The software varies,
so dig out that camera manual for specifics.
With the proper software installed, the transfer process works like so:
1. If you’re connecting via serial cable, turn off your computer and
camera. Then skip to Step 3.
This step is essential; most cameras don’t support hot swapping — 
connecting via serial cable while the devices are turned on. If you con-
nect the camera to the computer while either machine is powered up,
you risk damaging the camera.

2. If you’re connecting via USB, check your camera manual.
You probably do not have to shut down your computer before hooking
up the camera. But please, check your camera and computer manuals to
be certain. You may or may not need to turn the camera off.
3. Connect the camera to your computer.
Plug one end of the connection cable
into your camera and the other into
your computer. If you’re going the serial-
cable route and you use a Macintosh 
computer, you typically plug the camera
cable into the printer or modem port,
as shown in the top half of Figure 8-5. 
On a PC, the serial cable usually con-
nects to a COM port (often used for 
connecting external modems to the com-
puter), as shown in the bottom half of
Figure 8-5.
The setup is the same for cameras that
come with a USB cable. Plug one end of
the cable into the camera and the other
into your computer’s USB port, as illus-
trated in Figure 8-6. That little three-
pronged symbol you see between the two
ports in the figure is the universal USB
marking.
Note that if you use Windows 95, your
computer may refuse to recognize the
presence of the camera, even if you install
the Windows 95 update that is supposed
to enable USB. So if you want to avoid hassles, either upgrade to a
later version of Windows or use some method of image transfer other
than USB.
4. Turn the computer and camera back on, if you turned them off before
connecting.
5. Set the camera to the appropriate mode for image transfer.
On some cameras, you put the camera in playback mode; other cameras
have a PC setting. Check your manual to find out the right setting for your
model.

Figure 8-6: Most new cameras connect via a USB cable.
6. Start the image-transfer software.
When your computer detects the presence of the camera, a transfer pro-
gram may launch itself. For example, if you’ve set up Elements to act as
the transfer program, it appears automatically (refer to Figure 8-1 for a
look at the transfer window). Your camera also likely shipped with some
transfer software, and if you installed that software, it may jump to life
without any input from you. Figure 8-7 offers a look at the software for a
Fujifilm camera, for example. After the software launches, you need to
specify the folder where you want to house the pictures.
7. Download away.
From here on out, the commands and steps needed to get those pictures
from your camera onto your computer vary, depending on the camera
and what software you’re using. Sorry, but again I must point you toward
those all-important camera and software manuals for specifics. After you
start the transfer, you should see a progress bar or window letting you
know that the files are working their way to the computer, as shown in
the bottom half of Figure 8-7.
Most transfer software offers an option that deletes the original files from the
memory card after downloading. Turn this option off so that if something
goes awry during downloading, your originals are still on the memory card.
USB ports

Figure 8-7: Most cameras ship with a software tool for downloading images.
Take the bullet TWAIN
Chances are good that your camera comes with a CD that enables you to
install something called a TWAIN driver on your computer. TWAIN is a special
protocol (language) than enables your photo-editing or catalog program to
communicate directly with a digital camera or scanner. (The name TWAIN is
an homage to the Kipling poem that made famous the phrase “never the twain
shall meet,” although the more popular legend has long been that TWAIN
stands for Technology Without An Interesting Name.)
169
Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse

170
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
After you install the TWAIN driver, you can access picture files that are on the
camera through your photo-editing or cataloging program. Of course, your
camera still needs to be cabled to the computer. And your photo-editing or
cataloging program must be TWAIN compliant, meaning that it understands
the TWAIN language.
The command you use to open camera images varies from program to pro-
gram, but typically, the command is on the File menu. In some programs,
you can access your camera files as you would any files on your hard drive,
using the regular File➪Open command. In other programs, the command
name may be Acquire or Import. (In some programs, you first have to select
the TWAIN source — that is, specify which piece of hardware you want to
access. This command is also usually on the File menu.)
Camera as hard drive
With some digital cameras, the manufacturer provides software that, when
installed on your computer, makes your computer think that the camera is
just another hard drive. In this case, you can follow the same process for
transferring files as outlined in the earlier section “Using a card reader or
adapter.”
When you connect the camera to a Windows-based PC, for example, the
camera gets its own little drive icon in Windows Explorer. On a Macintosh,
the Finder displays the icon. The earlier section featured an Explorer exam-
ple, so Figure 8-8 offers up a Mac illustration. In this figure, the drive with
the label No Name is the camera. (Sometimes, the name of the camera appears
in the label.)
Whatever the operating system, you can access the files in the camera just as
you do files on your other drives. Then you can drag and drop files from the
camera to a location on your hard drive, an option that’s typically quicker than
downloading the individual images through the camera’s transfer software.
As discussed in the preceding section, you may also be able to get at your
camera files directly through your photo-editing or cataloging software.
Tips for trouble-free downloads
For whatever reason, the download process is one of the more complicated
aspects of digital photography. The introduction of card readers and USB
connections have made things much easier, but not all users have access to
this method. So don’t feel badly if you run into problems — I do this stuff on
a daily basis, and I still sometimes have trouble getting the download process
to run smoothly when I work with a new camera.

Figure 8-8: On a Mac, the camera shows up as a drive on the desktop.
Here are some troubleshooting tips I’ve picked up during my struggles with
image transfer:
 If you get a message saying that the software can’t communicate with the
camera, check to make sure that the camera is turned on and set to the
right mode (playback, PC mode, and so on).
 On a Macintosh, you may need to turn off AppleTalk, Express Modem,
and/or GlobalFax, which can conflict with the transfer software. Check
the camera manual for possible problem areas.
 On a PC, check the COM port setting in the transfer software if you have
trouble getting the camera and computer to talk to each other via a serial
cable connection. Make sure that the port selected in the download pro-
gram is the one into which you plugged the camera.

171
Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse

172
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 If you’re connecting via a USB port, make sure that the USB port is
enabled in your system. Some manufacturers ship their computers
with the port disabled. To find out how to turn the thing on, check
your computer manual. Also see my earlier comments about USB and
Windows 95 in the section “Cable transfer how-to’s.”
 Check your camera manufacturer’s Web site for troubleshooting infor-
mation. Manufacturers often post updated software drivers on their
Web sites to address downloading problems. Log on to the Web sites
for your brand of computer and image software, too, because problems
may be related to that end of the download process rather than to your
camera.
 Some transfer programs give you the option of choosing an image file
format and compression setting for your transferred images. Unless
you want to lose some image data — which results in lower image 
quality — choose the no-compression setting. (If that last sentence
sounded like complete gibberish, check out the section on file formats
in Chapter 5.)
 Digital cameras typically assign your picture files meaningless names
such as DCS008.jpg and DCS009.jpg (for PC files) or Image 1, Image 2,
and the like (for Mac files). If you previously downloaded images and
haven’t renamed them, files by the same names as the ones you’re
downloading may already exist on your hard drive.
When you attempt to transfer files, the computer should alert you to
this fact and ask whether you want to replace the existing images with
the new images. But just in case, you may want to create a new folder to
hold the new batch of images before you download. That way, you avoid
any chance of overwriting existing images.
 If your camera has an AC adapter, use it when downloading images via
cable. The process can take quite a while, and you need to conserve all
the battery power you can for your photography outings.
 I mentioned this earlier, but it bears repeating: When you initiate the
transfer process, you may be able to select an option that automatically
deletes all images from the camera’s memory after downloading. At the
risk of sounding paranoid, I never select this option. After you transfer
images, always review them on your computer monitor before you
delete any images from your camera. Glitches can happen, so make sure
that you really have that image on your computer before you wipe it off
your camera. As an extra precaution, make a backup copy of the image
on removable media (CD, Zip, or the like).

Translating Camera Raw Files
Many new, high-end digital cameras can capture images in the Camera Raw
file format — Raw, for short. As discussed in Chapter 5, this format stores
raw picture data from the image sensor, without applying any of the usual
post-processing that occurs when you shoot using the other two common
formats, JPEG and TIFF.
Although you can transfer Raw files to your computer using the same
processes outlined in the first part of this chapter, you can’t open them with-
out running them through a Raw converter. With this little piece of software,
you specify how you want the raw data translated into an actual picture.
Cameras that offer Raw as a file format usually ship with a converter utility.
But you may not need to use that utility; many photo-editing programs, includ-
ing Photoshop Elements, have a built-in converter. These converters aren’t
compatible with all cameras, though, so you need to see whether your model
is supported.
173
Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse
Oh no, I erased my pictures!
It happens to everyone sooner or later: You
accidentally erase an important picture — or
worse, an entire folder full of images. Don’t
panic yet — you may be able to get those pic-
tures back.
The first step: Stop shooting. If you take another
picture, you may not be able to rescue the deleted
files.
For pictures that you erased using the camera’s
delete function, go online or to your local com-
puter store to buy a file-recovery program such as
MediaRECOVER ($30, www.mediarecover.com)
or RescuePRO ($40, www.lc-tech.com). For these
programs to work, your computer must be able
to access the camera’s memory card as if the
card were a regular drive on the system. So if
your camera doesn’t show up as a drive when
you connect it to the computer, you may need to
buy a card reader or adapter as well. 
If you erased pictures on the computer, you may
not need any special software. In Windows
Explorer, deleted files go to the Recycle Bin and
stay there until you empty the Bin. Assuming
that you haven’t taken that step, just open the
Bin, click an erased file, and then choose File➪
Restore to “un-erase” the picture. On a Mac,
deleted files linger in the Trash folder until you
choose the Empty Trash command. Until you do,
you can open the Trash folder and move the
deleted file to another folder on your hard drive. 
Already emptied the Recycle Bin or Trash? You
also can buy programs to recover files that were
dumped in the process; start your software
search at the two aforementioned Web sites.

174
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
The following steps walk you through the process of converting Raw files in
Elements. The steps are pretty much the same no matter what converter you
use, although the controls you get for adjusting the Raw image vary.
1. Follow your normal process for transferring files to your computer.
Again, the first part of this chapter shows you the transfer process.
2. Choose File➪Open to launch the Open dialog box.
3. Track down the file and click Open.
For more ways to open an image file, see Chapter 11.
Elements recognizes that the file is in the Raw format and launches the
Camera Raw window, shown in Figure 8-9. Be sure that the Preview
check box underneath the image window is turned on; if not, click it.
Now you can see the results of any changes you make.
Figure 8-9: You must convert files shot in the Camera Raw format to a standard format before you can open them.

4. Use the controls on the right side of the window to tweak the image
appearance if necessary.
The upcoming list offers a few details about some of the more complex
controls.
5. Click OK to finish opening the file.
6. Choose File➪Save As to open the Save As dialog box.
7. Save the file in a standard image format.
Saving in your photo editor’s native format is best — in Elements, that’s
the PSD format. Another good option is the TIFF format. Chapter 11 offers
more specifics about saving files. Chapter 9 explains the options you
encounter when you save in the TIFF format.
Don’t skip this step — the converted file is only temporary until you
save it.
Now for those Elements converter details I promised in Step 4:

window controls the image bit depth. You can specify whether you want
an 8-bit file or a 16-bit file. This option is applicable only if your camera
is capable of shooting 16-bit files, however. See Chapter 2 for an explana-
tion of bit depth.
 Settings: Start out with the Settings drop-down list set to Camera Default,
as shown in Figure 8-9. The controls underneath that list then automati-
cally shift to settings that Elements considers appropriate for your
camera. When you tweak any of those controls, the Settings option
changes to Custom.
 Luminance Smoothing and Color Noise Reduction: These sliders, in the
bottom-right corner of the dialog box, are designed to remove noise, the
defect that makes your image look as though it was dusted with colored
sand. Keep a close eye on your photo as you drag these sliders; both
options soften focus as they tone down noise. (For more about removing
noise, see Chapter 11.)
 Shadows and Highlights: If you turn on the Shadows and Highlights 
controls underneath the image preview, Elements indicates shadows
and highlights that are clipped at the current settings. Clipping means
that pixels that were formerly different colors have shifted either to all
black — which destroys shadow detail — or all white, which eliminates
highlight detail. Clipped highlights are indicated by a red overlay; clipped
shadows, a blue overlay. In Figure 8-9, for example, the red splotches on
the iris petal indicate that the current settings result in highlight clipping.
If you see a lot of clipping, use the controls on the right side of the dialog
box to try to correct it.

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 Other adjustments: Unless you notice lots of clipping, I recommend that
you make changes to exposure, color, and sharpness after you open the
file rather than in the Camera Raw dialog box. You can then apply those
changes selectively, as outlined in Chapter 12, rather than applying them
to the entire image, as is required in the dialog box.
Don’t throw away your original Raw files. First, when you save the converted
file, some or all of the original EXIF metadata may be lost. (Chapter 4 explains
metadata.) Second, you may someday want to convert the file using different
settings.
Converting Proprietary Camera Files
Most digital cameras today store images in one of three standard formats:
JPEG, TIFF, or Camera Raw. But if you’re working with an older camera, it may
record images using a proprietary format. That means simply that the format
is used only by the type of camera you’re using. (Proprietary formats are
sometimes also referred to as native formats.)
If you want to edit photos stored in a proprietary format, you must use the
software provided with the camera to convert the files to a format that other
programs can open, just as you have to convert Camera Raw files.
After converting the files, you’re asked to specify the new format you want
to use to save them. To retain the most original image data and ensure the
widest compatibility with other programs, choose TIFF. Chapter 9 explains
the options that you may encounter when you save to the TIFF format.
If you need to share the file on the Internet, either via e-mail or on a Web
page, make a copy of that new TIFF file and save the copy in the JPEG format.
Chapter 10 explains the options you encounter in that case. Remember, JPEG
eliminates some image data, so don’t use it to store your original files.
As when working with Raw files, you should retain a copy of the original, pro-
prietary files even after you make your TIFF or JPEG copies. Saving to another
format usually wipes out any EXIF metadata that was recorded in the file, and
you may want to access that information one day.
Photo Organization Tools
After you move all those picture files from your camera to your hard drive,
a CD, or other image warehouse, you need to organize them so that you can
easily find a particular photo.

If you’re a no-frills type of person, you can simply organize your picture files
into folders, as you do your word-processing files, spreadsheets, and other
documents. You may keep all pictures shot during a particular year or month
in one folder, with images segregated into subfolders by subject. For example,
your main folder may be named Photos, and your subfolders may be named
Family, Sunsets, Holidays, Work, and so on.
Many photo-editing programs include a utility that enables you to browse
through your image files and view thumbnails of each photo. Figure 8-10
shows the organizer utility included for the Windows version of Photoshop
Elements 3.0, for example. Such utilities make it easy to track down a particu-
lar image if you can’t quite remember what you named the thing. (If you’re
running Elements 3.0 on the Mac, you can organize via the program’s File
Browser, introduced in Chapter 11.)
Figure 8-10: Photoshop Elements provides a built-in photo organizer; here, you see the Windows version.
177
Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse

178
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Depending on your computer’s operating system, it also may offer tools for
browsing through thumbnails of your digital photo files. Recent versions of
Windows, for example, enable you to view thumbnails in Windows Explorer. If
you work on a Macintosh computer running OS X 10.1.2 or later, you can down-
load a free copy of a browser called iPhoto at the Apple Web site. Figure 8-11
offers a look at iPhoto. (This software may look different depending on what
version of the operating system and iPhoto you use.)
You may find that your operating system or photo-editing program together
offer all the image-viewing and management tools that you need. But if you
find those tools too slow, too limited, or both, consider investing in a third-
party image-management program. Chapter 4 introduces you to one such
program, ThumbsPlus ($50, www.cerious.com); Figure 8-12 shows another of
my favorites, ACDSee, ($50, www.acdsystems.com). Another good option is
Extensis Portfolio (about $200, www.extensis.com).
Figure 8-11: Mac users can browse images using iPhoto.

Figure 8-12: ACDSee is a popular tool for viewing and organizing digital photo files.
In all these programs, you can browse and manage your images in several dif-
ferent layouts, including one that mimics the Windows Explorer format, as
shown in Figure 8-12. You also can inspect all the EXIF metadata that your
camera may store in the image file. 
But the real power of these products lies in their database features, which
you can use to assign keywords to images and then search for files using
those keywords. For example, if you have an image of a Labrador retriever,
you might assign the keywords “dog,” “retriever,” and “pet” to the picture’s
catalog information. When you later run a search, entering any of those key-
words as search criteria brings up the image.
Geared to more casual use, programs such as FlipAlbum Suite ($70, www.
flipalbum.com) feature a traditional photo-album motif. Figure 8-13 offers a
look at this program. You drag images from a browser onto album pages,
where you can then label the images and record information, such as the
date and place the image was shot.
179
Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse

180
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Figure 8-13: You can use programs such as FlipAlbum Suite to create digital photo albums.
Photo-album programs are great for those times when you want to leisurely
review your images or show them to others, much as you would enjoy a tra-
ditional photo album. And creating a digital photo album can be a fun project
to enjoy with your kids — they’ll love picking out frames for images and adding
other special effects. In addition, some album programs, including FlipAlbum
Suite, offer tools to help you create and share CDs containing your digital
photo albums. 
For simply tracking down a specific image or organizing images into folders,
however, I prefer the folder-type approach like the one used by the aforemen-
tioned organizer programs. I find that design quicker and easier to use than
flipping through the pages of a digital photo album.
Again, your photo editor may offer some of the same features as you find in
third-party organizers and album programs. Elements and Photoshop both
offer pretty capable organizers, for example. So be sure to explore those tools
before you invest in an unneeded extra program. And remember that you can
find free trials of most programs at the vendor’s Web site. To access those sites
easily, head for the Web page for this book, www.dummies.com/go/digital
photofd5e, which contains links to the products I cover.

etting a grip on all there is to know about digital photography can be a
little overwhelming — I know, I’ve been there. So if you’re feeling
like your head is already about to pop from all the new terms
and techniques you’ve stuffed into it, I have great news for
you: You only need to read the first section of this chap-
ter to find out how to get terrific prints of your digital
photos.
Those first paragraphs introduce you to retail photo-
printing services that make getting digital prints as
easy as having a roll of film developed. In fact, digi-
tal printing can be even more convenient than film
printing. If you like, you can handle the whole thing
via the Internet, without ever leaving home.
When you’re ready for do-it-yourself printing — and that

getting the best results from it. You can also find out how to set the
print size and resolution (ppi), save a TIFF copy of your picture for use in a
publication, and get better color matching between printer and monitor.

Fast and Easy: Prints from a Lab
In the first years of digital photography, the only option for people who didn’t
want to print their own photos was to find a professional photo lab that could
handle digital files. Unless you lived in a major city, you probably didn’t have
access to such a lab, and if you did, you paid big bucks to get your prints.
Now, any outlet that offers film developing, from your local drugstore to big-
box retailers such as Wal-Mart, also offers quick and easy digital camera
“developing.” You just take your memory card (or a CD full of images) to the
store and specify the print size and quantity, just as you do when dropping
off a roll of film.
The cost of retail printing has come way down, too. Depending on the number
of prints you make, you can get 4 x 6-inch prints for as little as 19 cents apiece.
If that sounds high compared with what you pay for a roll of film prints, keep
in mind that with digital, you’re printing only the pictures you really love.
With film, you pay to develop and print everything on the roll, even the badly
exposed and out-of-focus clunkers that you wind up throwing away. If you
stop and do the math, you’ll discover that digital prints usually end up being
cheaper than film prints.
What’s more, you now have a variety of options for getting your digital prints:
 One-hour printing: Drop your memory
card or CD off at the lab, fill out the order
form, and then go run other errands or do
your shopping. Come back to the lab in an
hour, and pick up your prints.
 Do-it-yourself kiosks: In a hurry? You don’t
even need to wait an hour for those prints.
Many stores offer self-service kiosks like
the one shown in Figure 9-1. Again, you just
put your memory card or CD into the
appropriate kiosk slot, push a few buttons,
and out come your prints. You can even do
some retouching, such as cropping and
eliminating red-eye, right at the kiosk.
 Order online, print locally: Here’s one of
my favorite options. You can send your
image files via the Internet to the store
where you want your prints made. Then
pick up the prints at your convenience. 
This option also makes it easy to get prints
to faraway friends and relatives. Instead of
having the prints made at your local lab
and then mailing them off, you can simply upload your files to a lab near
the people who want the prints. They can then pick up the prints at that

you can output your own prints in

lab. You can either prepay with a credit card or have the person getting
the prints pay upon picking them up.
For help finding a lab that’s conveniently located, check out these two
Web sites:
• www.digitalcameradeveloping.com
• www.prints-are-memories.com
At both sites, you can enter a zip code and get a list of printers, along
with a description of the services they offer, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 Order online, get prints by mail: Several Web-based print services offer
yet another option. You can upload your photo files for printing and then
receive the prints in the mail. Some sites to try include Kodak EasyShare
Gallery (formerly Ofoto, www.kodakgallery.com), shown in Figure 9-3,
Snapfish (www.snapfish.com), and Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com).
These sites are also picture-sharing sites, and you can read more about
them in Chapter 10.
Don’t limit yourself to 4 x 6 prints, either. Most places that can print your dig-
ital files also can produce calendars, t-shirts, mugs, and other items featuring
your favorite photos. Most can also copy your images to a CD, saving you the
step of archiving the files to CD yourself.

Buying a Photo Printer
Even if you have most of your prints made at a retail lab, adding a photo
printer to your digital-photography system is still a good investment. First,
when you need only a print or two, it’s more convenient to do the job your-
self than to send the pictures to a lab. Second, for times when you’re feeling
artistic, you can print on special media, such as canvas-textured paper. With
a model such as the $500 HP Photosmart 8750, shown in Figure 9-4, you can
even output borderless prints in sizes up to 13 x 19 inches. And of course,
doing your own printing gives you complete control over the output, which
is important to many photo enthusiasts, especially those who exhibit or sell
their work.
Today’s photo printers can produce excellent results, too. In fact, most people
can’t tell the difference between the prints I make at home and the ones I have
output at my local lab. 

HP
Figure 9-4: With this HP printer, you can output borderless prints up to 13 x 19 inches.
When you go printer shopping, you’ll encounter several types of printers.
Each offers advantages and disadvantages, and the technology you choose
depends on your budget, your printing needs, and your print-quality expecta-
tions. To help you make sense of things, the following sections discuss the
main categories of consumer and small-office printers.
Inkjet printers
Inkjet printers work by forcing little drops of ink through nozzles onto the
paper. Inkjet printers designed for the home office or small business cost 
anywhere from $50 to $800. Typically, print quality peaks as you reach the
$200 price range, though. Higher-priced inkjets offer speedier printing and
extra features, such as the ability to output on wider paper, produce border-
less prints, hook up to an office network, or print directly from a camera or
memory card. 
Most inkjet printers enable you to print on plain paper or thicker (and more
expensive) photographic stock, either with a glossy or matte finish. That flex-
ibility is great because you can print rough drafts and everyday work on plain
paper and save the more costly photographic stock for final prints and impor-
tant projects. As for cost per print, that number varies widely depending on
the paper and the printer; about the least you can expect to pay is $0.20 for a
4 x 6-inch print. See the upcoming section “Comparison Shopping” for some
additional information on this issue. 
185
Chapter 9: Can I Get a Hard Copy, Please?

186
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Inkjets fall into two basic categories:
 General-purpose models, which are engineered to do a decent job on
both text and pictures.
 Photo printers, sometimes referred to as photocentric printers, which are
geared solely toward printing images. Photocentric printers produce
better-quality photographic output than all-purpose printers, but they’re
sometimes not well suited to everyday text printing because the print
speed can be slower than on a general-purpose machine.
That’s not to say that you should expect lightning-fast prints from a general-
purpose inkjet, though. Even on the fastest inkjet, outputting a color image
can take several minutes if you use the highest-quality print settings.
In addition, the wet ink can cause the paper to warp slightly, and the ink can
smear easily until the print dries. (Remember when you were a kid and painted
with watercolors in a coloring book? The effect is similar with inkjets, although
not as pronounced.) You can lessen both of these effects by using paper espe-
cially made for inkjets.
Despite these flaws, inkjets remain a good, economical solution for many
users. Newer inkjet models incorporate refined technology that produces
much higher image quality, less color bleeding, and less page warping than
models in years past. Images printed on glossy photo stock from the latest
photocentric inkjets rival those from a professional imaging lab. For the
record, I’ve been especially impressed with output from Epson, HP, and
Canon photocentric models.
Laser printers
Laser printers use a technology similar to that used in photocopiers. I doubt
that you want to know the details, so let me just say that the process involves
a laser beam, which produces electric charges on a drum, which rolls toner —
the ink, if you will — onto the paper. Heat is applied to the page to perma-
nently affix the toner to the page (which is why pages come out of a laser
printer warm).
Color lasers can produce near-photographic quality images as well as excel-
lent text. They’re faster than inkjets, and you don’t need to use any special
paper (although you get better results if you use a high-grade laser paper as
opposed to cheap copier paper).
The downside to color lasers? Price. Although they’ve become much more
affordable over the past two years, color lasers still run $200 and up. And
these printers tend to be big in stature as well as price — this isn’t a machine
that you want to use in a small home office that’s tucked into a corner of your
kitchen.

As for photo quality, it varies from machine to machine, so be sure to read
reviews carefully. To my eye, laser-printed photos aren’t quite as impressive
as those from the best inkjets, but that’s a personal preference. Many people
can’t tell the difference between an inkjet and laser print.
If you have the need for high-volume color output, a color laser printer can
make sense. Although you may pay more up front than for an inkjet, you
should save money over time because the price of consumables (toner or ink,
plus paper) is usually lower for laser printing than inkjet printing. Many color
lasers also offer networked printing, making them attractive to offices where
several people share the same printer. Figure 9-5 offers a look at a color laser
from Konica Minolta.
Konica Minolta Photo Imaging
Figure 9-5: Color lasers are now very affordable and can produce 
good photo prints.
Dye-sub (thermal dye) printers
Dye-sub is short for dye-sublimation, which is worth remembering only for
the purpose of one-upping the science-fair winner who lives down the street.
Dye-sub printers transfer images to paper using a plastic film or ribbon that’s
coated with colored dyes. During the printing process, heating elements move
across the film, causing the dye to fuse to the paper.
Dye-sub printers are also called thermal-dye printers — heated (thermal)
dye . . . get it?
187
Chapter 9: Can I Get a Hard Copy, Please?

188
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Some popular snapshot printers, including certain models from Kodak, use
this technology. Dye-sub printers fall within the same price range as quality
inkjets, and most produce good-looking prints.
However, dye-sub machines present a few disadvantages that may make them
less appropriate for your home or office than an inkjet:
 Most dye-sub printers can output
only snapshot size prints, although
a few new models, such as the $500
Olympus P-440 shown in Figure 9-6,
can produce 8 x 10-inch prints.
 You have to use special stock
designed to work expressly with
dye-sub printers. That means that
dye-sub printing isn’t appropriate
for general-purpose documents;
these machines are purely photo-
graphic tools.
The cost per print depends on the
size of the paper, as with any printer.
With the Olympus P-440, the cost of 
an 8 x 10-inch print is just under $2.
Thermo-Autochrome 
printers
A handful of printers use Thermo-Autochrome technology. With these printers,
you don’t have any ink cartridges, sticks of wax, or ribbons of dye. Instead,
the image is created using light-sensitive paper — the technology is similar
to that found in fax machines that print on thermal paper.
You can find Thermo-Autochrome printers within the same general price range
as dye-sub printers. But as with dye-sub machines, most Thermo-Autochrome
printers can output only snapshot-size prints and can’t print on plain paper.
More important, examples that I’ve seen from consumer printers that employ
this technology don’t match dye-sub or good inkjet output, although I will say
that the latest crop of Thermo-Autochrome printers does a much better job
than earlier models.

8 x 10-inch dye-sub prints.

How Long Will They Last?
In addition to the issues presented in the preceding discussion of printer
types, another important factor to consider when deciding on a printer is
print stability — that is, how long can you expect the prints to last?
All photographs are subject to fading and color shifts over time. Researchers
say that a standard film print has a life expectancy of anywhere from 10 to
60 years, depending on the photographic paper, the printing process, and
exposure to ultraviolet light and airborne pollutants, such as ozone. Those
same criteria affect the stability of photos that you output on your home or
office printer.
Unfortunately, the two technologies capable of delivering image quality equal
to a traditional photograph — dye-sub and inkjet printing — produce prints
that can degrade rapidly, especially when displayed in very bright light. Hang a
print in front of a sunny window, and you may notice some fading or a change
in colors in as little as a few months.
Manufacturers have been scrambling to
address this issue, and several possible
solutions have been introduced
recently. A few years ago, Epson intro-
duced an inkjet printer that used
longer-lasting, pigment-based inks, as
opposed to the standard dye-based
inks. Figure 9-7 shows the latest version
of this printer, the $850 R2400. Epson
estimates that color prints made with
these inks, on Epson’s archival paper,
should resist fading for up to 108 years.
The downside to pigment-based
inks — you knew there had to be one,
didn’t you — is that they can repro-
duce a smaller range of colors than
dye-based inks. Will you notice the dif-
ference? Hard to tell, because it depends on the color range you’re capturing
with your camera. I can tell you that many professional photographers
(including me) rely on pigment-based printers to produce the prints they sell
and exhibit.
189
Chapter 9: Can I Get a Hard Copy, Please?
Seiko Epson Corp.
Figure 9-7: Some printers feature pigment-
based inks instead of dye-based inks.

190
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Epson and several other vendors also make inks and papers that you can
use with dye-based inkjet printers and are engineered to provide a print life
of 25 years or more. You may or may not be able to take advantage of these
products, depending on your printer. (Note that when you use inks not specifi-
cally provided by the printer’s manufacturer, you may not get the best print
quality and you may void the printer’s warranty.)
Some dye-sub printers, such as the Olympus P-440 featured in Figure 9-6, add
a special protective coating to prints to help extend print life. The folks at
Olympus say that photos from this printer have about the same life expectancy
as a traditional photograph.
The truth is, though, that no one really knows just how long a print from
any of these new printers — inkjet or dye-sub — will last because they just
haven’t been around that long. The estimates given by manufacturers are
based on lab tests that try to simulate the effect of years of exposure to light
and atmospheric contaminants. But the research results are pretty varied, and
the anticipated photo life you can expect from any printing system depends
on whose numbers you use.
If your photography requires archival printing, you can dig a little deeper
into the subject at the Web site of Wilhelm Imaging Research (www.wilhelm-
research.com), a respected source of print life studies. The company posts
details about specific papers, inks, and dyes at its site. 
Protecting your prints
No matter what the type of print, you can help
keep its colors bright and true by adhering to the
following storage and display guidelines:
 If you’re framing the photo, mount it behind
a matte to prevent the print from touching
the glass. Be sure to use acid-free, archival
matte board and UV-protective glass.
 Display the picture in a location where it isn’t
exposed to strong sunlight or fluorescent
light for long periods of time.
 In photo albums, slip pictures inside acid-
free, archival sleeves.
 Don’t adhere prints to a matte board or other
surface using masking tape, scotch tape, or
other household products. Instead, use acid-
free mounting materials, sold in art-supply
stores and some craft stores.
 Limit exposure to humidity, wide temperature
swings, cigarette smoke, and other airborne
pollutants, as these can also contribute to
image degradation.
 Although the refrigerator door is a popular
spot to hang favorite photos, it’s probably the
worst location in terms of print longevity.
Unless protected by a frame, the photo
paper soaks up all the grease and dirt from
your kitchen, not to mention jelly-smudged
fingerprints and other telltale signs left
when people open and close the door.
 For the ultimate protection, always keep a
copy of the image file on a CD-ROM or other
storage medium so that you can output a
new print if the original one deteriorates.
See Chapter 4 for advice on archiving your
digital files.

So Which Printer Should You Buy?
The answer to that question depends on your printing needs and your print-
ing budget. Here’s my take on which of the printing technologies works best
for which situation:
 If you want the closest thing to traditional photographic prints, go for a
photo inkjet or dye-sub model. If you go dye-sub, though, remember that
you can’t print on plain paper.
 If you’re buying a printer for use in an office and you want a machine
that can handle high-volume printing, look into color lasers.
 For home or small-office printing of both text and photos, opt for a 
general-purpose inkjet model. You can produce good-looking color and
grayscale images, although you need to use high-grade paper and the
printer’s highest quality settings to get the best results. You can print on
glossy photographic paper as well.
A brief warning about general-purpose inkjets: Some of the inkjets I’ve
tried have been so slow and had such page-warping problems that I would
never consider using them on a daily basis. Others do a really good job,
delivering sharp, clean images in a reasonable amount of time, with little
evidence of the problems normally associated with this printing technol-
ogy. The point is, all inkjets are not created equal, so shop carefully.
 If you’re using your digital camera for business and frequently need
prints on the road, consider adding a
portable printer to your equipment
roster. Several manufacturers sell
small, lightweight, snapshot printers
that can print directly from a camera
or memory card. 
 In the past, multipurpose printers —
those that combine a color printer,
copy machine, and scanner in one
unit — didn’t produce the kind of
output that would satisfy most photo
enthusiasts. Today, however, some
all-in-one printers use the same print
technology as in the company’s photo
printers and so really can deliver
good photographic prints. If you need
a new scanner as well as a printer,
these models are worth considering,
especially if you have limited desktop
space. The Canon model shown in
Figure 9-8, for example, is a digital-
imaging workhorse: You can print
new images from a memory card or
camera, scan and copy old prints,
and even scan slides and negatives.

Figure 9-8: This all-in-one from Canon can
print from a memory card or camera and
also can scan prints, slides, and negatives.

192
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Keep in mind that most photocentric printers aren’t engineered with text
printing as the primary goal, so your text may not look as sharp as it would
on a low-cost black-and-white laser or inkjet printer. Also, your text printing
costs may be higher than on a black-and-white printer because of ink costs.
Comparison Shopping
After you determine which type of printer is best for your needs, you can get
down to the nitty-gritty and compare models and brands. Print quality and
other features can vary widely from model to model, so do plenty of research.
The easiest feature to compare is the size of print that the machine can pro-
duce. You have three basic options:
 Standard printers can print on paper as large as 8.5 x 11 inches, or what
we commonly refer to as letter-size paper. However, some printers can’t
print all the way to the edge of the
paper — in other words, can’t pro-
duce borderless photo prints.
 Wide-format printers — such as
the models pictured in Figure 9-4
and 9-7 — can handle larger paper.
The maximum size print varies from
model to model. In addition, some
wide-format printers can print bor-
derless prints.
 Snapshot printers are limited to print-
ing pictures at sizes of 4 x 6 inches or
smaller. Figure 9-9 shows one snap-
shot printer from HP. Most snapshot
printers, including this one, can print
directly from camera memory cards.
If the printer and camera both offer
PictBridge technology, you can also
connect the printer right to the
camera. The HP model even has a
small monitor that enables you to
view your pictures before printing.
After you get past print size, sorting through the remaining printer features
can get a little murky. The information you see on the printer boxes or mar-
keting brochures can be a little misleading. So here’s a translation of the most
critical printer data to study when you’re shopping:
Figure 9-9: Many snapshot printers print
from the camera or a memory card.

 Dpi: Dpi stands for dots per inch and refers to the number of dots of color
the printer can create per linear inch. You can find consumer-level color
printers with resolutions from 300 dpi up to 2400 dpi.
A higher dpi means a smaller printer dot, and the smaller the dot, the
harder it is for the human eye to notice that the image is made up of
dots. So in theory, a higher dpi should mean better-looking images. But
because different types of printers create images differently, an image
output at 300 dpi on one printer may look considerably better than an
image output at the same or even higher dpi on another printer. For exam-
ple, a 300-dpi dye-sub printer may produce prints that look better than
those from a 600-dpi inkjet. So although printer manufacturers make a
big deal about their printers’ resolutions, dpi isn’t always a reliable mea-
sure of print quality. For more information about resolution and dpi, take
a cab to Chapter 2.
 Quality options: Many printers give you the option of printing at several
different quality settings. You can choose a lower quality for printing
rough drafts of your images and then bump up the quality for final output.
Typically, the higher the quality setting, the longer the print time and, on
inkjet printers, the more ink required.
Ask to see a sample image printed at each of the printer’s quality settings
and determine whether those settings are appropriate for your needs.
For example, is the draft quality so poor that you would need to use the
highest quality setting even for printing proofs? If so, you may want to
choose another printer if you print a lot of drafts.
Also, if you need to print many grayscale images as well as color images,
find out whether you’re limited to the printer’s lowest-quality setting for
grayscale printing. Some printers offer different options for color and
grayscale images.
 Inkjet colors: Most inkjets print using four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black. This ink combination is known as CMYK (see the sidebar
“The separate world of CMYK,” later in this chapter). Some lower-end
inkjets eliminate the black ink and just combine cyan, magenta, and
yellow to approximate black. “Approximate” is the key word — you
don’t get good, solid blacks without that black ink, so for best color
quality, avoid three-color printers.
Some photocentric inkjets feature six or more ink colors, adding lighter
shades of the primary colors or several shades of gray to the standard
CMYK mix. The extra inks expand the range of colors that the printer
can manufacture, resulting in more accurate color rendition, but add to
the print cost.

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
If you enjoy making black-and-white prints — grayscale prints, in official
digital-imaging lingo — look for a printer that adds the extra gray car-
tridges. Some printers that use only one black cartridge have a difficult
time outputting truly neutral grays — prints often have a slight color tint.
Browse magazines that cover black-and-white photography for leads on
the best machines for this type of printing.
 Print speed: If you use your printer for business purposes and you print
a lot of images, be sure that the printer you pick can output images at a
decent speed. And be sure to find out the per-page print speed for print-
ing at the printer’s highest quality setting. Most manufacturers list print
speeds for the lowest-quality or draft-mode printing. When you see claims
like “Prints at speeds up to . . . ,” you know you’re seeing the speed for
the lowest-quality print setting.
 Cost per print: To understand the true cost of a printer, you need to
think about how much you’ll pay for consumables each time you print
a picture. This is pretty easy for a dye-sub printer because you buy the
paper and dye ribbon together, with each packet producing a specific
number of prints.
For inkjets and laser printers, things are less clear. The paper part is easy,
of course; just find out what kind of paper the manufacturer recommends
and then go to any computer store or office-supply outlet and check
prices for that paper. Calculating your ink or laser toner costs is pretty
difficult, however. Manufacturers usually state costs in terms of x per-
centage of coverage per page — for example, “three cents per page at
15 percent coverage.” In other words, if your image covers 15 percent
of an 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of paper, you spend three cents on toner or ink.
The problem is that no single standard for calculating this data exists, so
you really can’t compare apples to apples. One manufacturer may spec-
ify per-print costs based on one size image and one print-quality setting,
while another uses an entirely different print scenario.
My advice? Don’t discount cost-per-print data entirely, but don’t take it
as gospel, either. This information is most useful for deciding between
different print technologies — inkjet, laser, and so on. But when you com-
pare models within a category, don’t drive yourself nuts trying to find
the model that claims to shave a percentage of a penny off your print
costs. Remember, the numbers you see are approximations at best and
are calculated in a fashion designed to make the use costs appear as low
as possible. As they say in the car ads, your actual mileage may vary.
That said, if you’re buying an inkjet printer, you can lower your ink costs
somewhat by choosing a printer that uses a separate ink cartridge for
each ink color or at least uses a separate cartridge for the black ink.
On models that have just one cartridge for all inks, you usually end up
throwing away some ink because one color often becomes depleted
before the others.

Also remember that some printers require special cartridges for printing
in photographic-quality mode. In some cases, these cartridges lay down
a clear overcoat over the printed image. The overcoat gives the image a
glossy appearance when printed on plain paper and also helps protect
the ink from smearing and fading. In other cases, you put in a cartridge
that enables you to print with more colors than usual — for example, if
the printer usually prints using four inks, you may insert a special photo
cartridge that enables you to print using six inks. These special photo-
graphic inks and overlay cartridges are normally more expensive than
standard inks. So when you compare output from different printers, find
out whether the images were printed with the standard ink setup or with
more expensive photographic inks.
 Computer-free printing: Some printers can print directly from camera
memory cards — no computer required. You insert your memory card,
use the printer’s control panel to set up the print job, and press the
Print button.
Many printers also can print directly from the camera itself. In years
past, this option worked only if the printer and camera were from the
same manufacturer. But now, you can hook up any camera that offers
PictBridge connectivity to any PictBridge-enabled printer. Manufacturers
are also starting to introduce printers and cameras that can communi-
cate wirelessly; expect to see more of these devices in the future.
Also look for something called DPOF (say it dee-poff), which stands for
digital print order format. DPOF enables you to select the images you
want to print through your camera’s user interface. The camera records
your instructions and passes them onto the printer when you transfer
the images between the two devices.
Of course, direct printing takes away your chance to edit your pictures;
you may be able to use camera or printer settings to make minor changes,
such as rotating the image, making the picture brighter, or applying a
prefab frame design, but that’s all. Direct printing is great on occasions
where print immediacy is more important than image perfection, how-
ever. For example, a real-estate agent taking a client for a site visit can
shoot pictures of the house and output prints in a flash so that the client
can take pictures home that day.
 PostScript printing: If you want to be able to print graphics created in
illustration programs such as Adobe Illustrator and saved in the EPS
(Encapsulated PostScript) file format, you need a printer that offers
PostScript printing functions. Some photo-editing programs enable you
to save in EPS as well. Some printers have PostScript support built in,
while others can be made PostScript-compatible with add-on software.

The separate world of CMYK
As you know if you read Chapter 2, on-screen
images are RGB images. RGB images are cre-
ated by combining red, green, and blue light. Your
digital camera and scanner also produce RGB
images. Professional printing presses and most,
but not all, consumer printers, on the other hand,
create images by mixing four colors of ink —
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Pictures cre-
ated using these four colors are called CMYK
images. (The K is used instead of B because
black is called the key color in CMYK printing.)
You may be wondering why four primary colors
are needed to produce colors in a printed image,
while only three are needed for RGB images.
(Okay, I know you’re probably not wondering
that at all, but indulge me.) The answer is that
unlike light, inks are impure. Black is needed to
help ensure that black portions of an image are
truly black, not some muddy gray, as well as to
account for slight color variations between inks
produced by different vendors.
What does all this CMYK stuff mean to you?
First, if you’re shopping for an inkjet printer, be
aware that some models print using only three
inks, leaving out the black. Color rendition is
usually worse on models that omit the black ink.
Second, if you’re sending your image to a service
bureau for printing, you may need to convert your
image to the CMYK color mode and create color
separations. If you read “The Secret to Living
Color” in Chapter 2, you may recall that CMYK
images comprise four color channels — one
each for the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black
image information. Color separations are noth-
ing more than grayscale printouts of each color
channel. During the printing process, your printer
combines the separations to create the full-color
image. If you’re not comfortable doing the CMYK
conversion and color separations yourself or
your image-editing software doesn’t offer this
capability, your service bureau or printer can do
the job for you. (Be sure to ask the service rep
whether you should provide RGB or CMYK
images, because some printers require RGB.)
Don’t convert your images to CMYK for printing
on your own printer, because consumer print-
ers are engineered to work with RGB image
data. And no matter whether you’re printing
your own images or having them commercially
reproduced, remember that CMYK has a smaller
gamut than RGB, which is a fancy way of saying
that you can’t reproduce with inks all the colors
you can create with RGB. CMYK can’t handle
the really vibrant, neon colors you see on your
computer monitor, for example, which is why
images tend to look a little duller after conver-
sion to CMYK and why your printed images
don’t always match your on-screen images.
One more note about CMYK: If you’re shopping
for a new inkjet printer, you may see a few models
described as CcMmYK or CcMmYKk printers.
Those lowercase letters indicate that the printer
offers a light cyan, magenta, or black ink, respec-
tively, in addition to the traditional cyan, magenta,
and black cartridges. As I mentioned earlier, the
added inksets are provided to expand the range
of colors that the printer can produce.
For more information about RGB and CMYK,
hightail it to Chapter 2.

Although the preceding specifications should give you a better idea of which
printer you want, also search through computer and photography magazines
for reviews of any printer you’re considering. In addition, you can get customer
feedback on different models by logging onto one of the digital photography
or printing newsgroups on the Internet. See Chapter 16 for leads on two news-
groups as well as a list of other sources for finding the information you need.
Just as with any other major purchase, you should also investigate the printer’s
warranty — one year is typical, but some printers offer longer warranties.
And be sure to find out whether the retail or mail-order company selling the
printer charges a restocking fee if you return the printer. Many sellers charge
as much as 15 percent of the purchase price in restocking fees. (In my city, all
the major computer stores charge restocking fees, but the office supply stores
don’t — yet.)
I resent the heck out of restocking fees, especially when it comes to costly
equipment like printers, and I never buy at outfits that charge these fees. Yes,
I understand that after you open the ink cartridges and try out the printer,
the store can’t sell that printer as new (at least, not without putting in replace-
ment ink cartridges). But no matter how many reviews you read or how many
questions you ask, you simply can’t tell for certain that a particular printer
can do the job you need it to do without taking the printer home and testing
it with your computer and with your own images.
Few stores have printers hooked up to computers, so you can’t test-print
your own images in the store. Some printers can output samples using the
manufacturer’s own images, but those images are carefully designed to show
the printer at its best and mask any problem areas. So either find a store
where you can do your own pre-purchase testing, or make sure that you’re
not going to pay a hefty fee for the privilege of returning the printer.
Does the Paper Really Matter?
Sorry, the answer is yes. With paper, as with most things in life, you get what
you pay for. The better the paper, the more your images will look like tradi-
tional print photographs. In fact, if you want to upgrade the quality of your
images, simply changing the paper stock can do wonders.
If your printer can accept different stocks, print drafts of your images on the
cheaper stocks, and reserve the good stuff for final output. By “good stuff,”
I mean paper from a well-known manufacturer, not the cheap store brands.
Start with paper from the manufacturer of your printer because that paper is
specifically engineered to work with your printer’s inks. The prints you make
with that paper can give you a baseline from which you can compare results
on other brands.

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Don’t limit yourself to printing images on standard photo paper, though. You
can buy special paper kits that enable you to put images on calendars, stick-
ers, greeting cards, transparencies (for use in overhead projectors), and all
sorts of other stuff. Some printers even offer accessory kits for printing your
photos on coffee mugs and t-shirts. And if you use an inkjet printer, try out
some of the new textured papers, which have surfaces that mimic traditional
watercolor paper, canvas, and the like.
Setting Print Size and Resolution
As mentioned several times earlier in this chapter, many printers enable you
to output prints right from a memory card or from the camera. If you’re going
that route, just follow the instructions in your printer manual. There’s really
not much to do in advance of printing except specify the size of the print and
the number of copies, which you do either via your camera menus or buttons
on the printer. 
Many photo-editing programs also offer simplified printing, providing wizards
that ask you to set only print size and other basics. If you like the results you
get from these automated printing utilities, great. But keep in mind that when
you set the print size this way, you let the printer software or your imaging
software make the all-important resolution decision for you.
Chapter 2 explains this issue fully, but here’s a quick recap: 
 Resolution — pixels per inch — has a major impact on print quality.
To do their best work, most printers need 200 to 300 pixels per inch.
If you’re having your picture output at a professional lab, you may be
required to submit the file at a specific resolution.
 When you enlarge an image, one of two things happens: The resolution
goes down and the pixel size increases, or the software adds new pixels
to fill the enlarged image area (a process called upsampling). Both options
can result in a loss of image quality.
 Similarly, when you reduce print size, you can retain the current pixel
count, in which case the resolution goes up and the pixel size shrinks.
Or you can retain the current resolution, in which case the image-editing
software downsamples the image (dumps excess pixels). Because dump-
ing too many pixels can also harm your image, avoid downsampling by
more than 25 percent. With some photos, you may not notice any quality
loss even if you downsample by a greater degree, however. 
 To figure out the maximum size at which you can print your image at
a desired resolution, divide the horizontal pixel count (the number of
pixels across) by the desired resolution. The result gives you the maxi-
mum print width (in inches). To determine the maximum print height,
divide the vertical pixel count by the desired resolution.

 What if you don’t have enough pixels to get both the print size and reso-
lution you want? Well, you have to choose which is more important. If
you absolutely need a certain print size, you just have to sacrifice some
image quality and accept a lower resolution. And if you absolutely need
a certain resolution, you have to live with a smaller image. Hey, life’s full
of compromises, right?
Again, if you’re happy with the prints you get when you go the automatic route,
that’s terrific. Some print utilities offer guidance as to how large you can print
your picture without losing quality; pay attention to those on-screen messages,
and you’ll be fine.
But if you do want to take control over output resolution, you must set the
print size and resolution before you send the image to the printer. Here’s how
to do the job in Elements:
1. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box shown in Figure 9-10 appears.
Figure 9-10: Set print size and output resolution (ppi) in the Image 
Size dialog box.
2. Turn off the Resample Image check box.
This option controls whether the program can add or delete pixels as
you change the print dimensions. When the option is turned off, the
number of pixels can’t be altered.
199
Chapter 9: Can I Get a Hard Copy, Please?

200
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Click the box to toggle the option on and off. An empty box means that
the option is turned off, which is what you want in this case.
3. Enter the print dimensions or resolution.
Enter the print dimensions in the Width or Height boxes; as you change
one value, the other changes automatically to retain the original pro-
portions of the picture. Likewise, as you change the dimensions, the
Resolution value changes automatically. If you prefer, you can change
the Resolution value, in which case the program alters the Width and
Height values accordingly.
4. Click OK or press Enter.
If you did things correctly — that is, deselected the Resample Image
check box in Step 2 — you shouldn’t see any change in your image on-
screen, because you still have the same number of pixels to display.
However, if you choose View➪Rulers, which displays rulers along the
top and left side of your image, you can see that the image will, in fact,
print at the dimensions you specified.
5. If you want to retain the current settings after you close the image,
save the file.
If you want to resample the image in order to achieve a certain print resolu-
tion, select the Resample Image check box. (Click the box so that a check
mark appears inside.) Turn on the Constrain Proportions box and the Scale
Styles box, if it’s available. Then set your desired Width, Height, and Resolution
values.
When the Resample Image option is enabled, a second set of Width and
Height boxes becomes available at the top of the dialog box. Use these
options if you want to set your photo dimensions using pixels or percent
(of the original dimensions) as the unit of measure.
After resampling, be sure to save your image with a new name. You may want
the image at the original pixel count some day.
If you’re using another photo editor, be sure to consult the program’s Help
system or manual for information on resizing options available to you.
Advanced photo-editing programs such as Elements offer you the option of
controlling resolution as you resize, but some entry-level programs don’t.
Instead, these programs automatically resample the image any time you
resize it, so be careful.
How can you tell if a program is resampling images upon resizing? Check the
“before” and “after” size of the image file. If the file size changes when you
resize the image, the program is resampling the photo. (Adding or deleting
pixels increases or reduces the file size.)

Sending Your Image to the Dance
Printing from your photo-editing or cataloging software is similar to printing
a file in any computer program. Here’s the general overview: 
1. Open the photo file.
Chapter 11 offers help with this step if you need it.
2. Set the image size and resolution as discussed in the preceding 
section.
3. Choose the Print command.
In almost every program on the planet, the Print command resides on
the File menu. Choosing the command results in a dialog box through
which you can change the print settings, including the printer resolution
or print quality and the number of copies you want to print. You can
also specify whether you want to print in portrait mode, which prints
your image in its normal, upright position, or landscape mode, which
prints your image sideways on the page. Figure 9-11 shows the dialog
box that appears when you choose the Print command in Elements.
Figure 9-11: The Elements Print Preview dialog box offers a variety of print settings.
201

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
4. Specify the print options you want to use.
The available options — and the manner in which you access those
options — vary widely depending on the type of printer you’re using and
whether you’re working on a PC or a Mac. In some cases, you can access
settings via the Print dialog box; in other cases, you may need to go to the
Page Setup dialog box, which opens when you choose the Page Setup
command, generally found on the File menu, not too far from the Print
command. (In Elements, as in some other programs, you can access the
Page Setup dialog box by clicking the Page Setup button inside the Print
dialog box, too.)
I’d love to explain and illustrate all kazillion variations of Print and Page
Setup dialog box options, but I have neither the time, space, nor psy-
chotherapy budget that task would require. So please read your printer’s
manual for information on what settings to use in what scenarios, and,
for heaven’s sake, follow the instructions. Otherwise, you aren’t going to
get the best possible images your printer can deliver.
Also, if you have more than one printer, make sure that you have the
right printer selected before you go setting all the printer options.
Stay away from any options inside the Print dialog box that adjust the
picture size or resolution, or you undo the work you did in Step 2. In
Elements, leave the Print Size option set to Actual Size, and keep your
paws off the Print Scale options.
5. Send that puppy to the printer.
Look in the dialog box for an OK or Print button and click the button to
send your image scurrying for the printer.
Getting better results from your printer
With the general printing info under your belt — and with your own printer
manual close at hand — you’re ready for some more specific tips about making
hard copies of your images. So here are a few tips that can help you get the
best output from any printer:
 Better paper equals better prints. For those special pictures, invest in
glossy photographic stock or some other high-grade option.
 When setting up the print job, be sure to choose the right paper set-
tings. If the printer is set to print on matte paper, for example, and you
instead feed it glossy stock, you’re going to have a smeary mess on your
hands.
 Do a test print using different printer-resolution or print-quality set-
tings. This process enables you to determine which settings work best
for which types of images and which types of paper. The default settings
selected by the printer’s software may not be the best choices for the

types of images you print. Be sure to note the appropriate settings so
that you can refer to them later. Also, some printer software enables you
to save custom settings so that you don’t have to reset all the controls
each time you print. Check your printer manual to find out whether your
printer offers this option.
 Don’t forget to install the printer driver (software) on your computer.
Follow the installation instructions closely so that the driver is installed
in the right folder in your system. Otherwise, your computer can’t com-
municate with your printer.
 Use the right printer cable. If your printer didn’t ship with a cable to
connect the printer and computer — most don’t — make sure that
you buy the correct type of cable. For parallel-port connections,
most printers require bidirectional, IEEE 1284–compliant cables. Don’t
worry about what that means — just look for the words on the cable
package. And don’t cheap out and buy less-expensive cables that don’t
meet this specification, or you won’t get optimum performance from
your system.
 Some printers don’t perform well when connected to the computer
through a pass-through device. For example, if you have a CD recorder
connected to your computer’s printer port and then plug your printer into
a printer port on the CD recorder, you may experience printing hang-ups.
Do a test print after connecting your printer to any new pass-through
devices.
 Don’t ignore your printer manual’s instructions regarding routine
printer maintenance. Print heads can become dirty, inkjet nozzles
can become clogged, and all sorts of other gremlins can gunk up the
works. When testing an inkjet model for this book, for example, I almost
wrote the printer off as a piece of junk because I was getting horrendous
printouts. Then I followed the troubleshooting advice in the manual and
cleaned the print heads. The difference was like night and day. Suddenly,
I was getting beautiful, rich images, just like the printer’s advertisements
promised.
As for the number-one printing complaint — printed colors that look different
from on-screen colors — move to the next section.
These colors don’t match!
You may notice a significant color shift between your on-screen and printed
images. This color shift is due in part to the fact that you simply can’t repro-
duce all RGB colors using printer inks, a problem explained in the sidebar
“The separate world of CMYK,” earlier in this chapter. In addition, the bright-
ness of the paper, the purity of the ink, and the lighting conditions in which
you view the image can all lead to colors that look different on paper than
they do on-screen.
203
Chapter 9: Can I Get a Hard Copy, Please?

204
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Although perfect color matching is impossible, you can take a few steps to
bring your printer and monitor colors closer together, as follows:
 On an inkjet printer, check your ink status. An empty or clogged ink car-
tridge is very often the culprit when colors are seriously off.
 Changing your paper stock sometimes affects color rendition. In my
experience, the better the paper, the truer the color matching.
 The software provided with most color printers includes color-matching
controls that are designed to get your screen and image colors to jibe.
Check your printer manual for information on how to access these 
controls.
 If playing with the color-matching options doesn’t work, the printer 
software may offer controls that enable you to adjust the image’s color
balance. When you adjust the color balance using the printer software,
you don’t make any permanent changes to your image. Again, you need
to consult your printer manual for information on specific controls and
how to access and use them.
 Don’t convert your images to the CMYK color model for printing on a
consumer printer. These printers are designed to work with RGB images,
so you get better color matching if you work in the RGB mode.
 Many image-editing programs also include utilities that are designed to
assist in the color-matching process as well. Some of these are very user-
friendly; after printing a sample image, you let the program know which
sample most closely matches what you see on-screen. The program then
calibrates itself automatically using this information.
Photoshop Elements, Photoshop, and other advanced programs offer
more sophisticated color-management options. If you’re new to the game,
I suggest you leave these settings in their default positions, as the whole
topic is a little mind-boggling and you can just as easily make things worse
as improve them. Many of the color settings aren’t designed to improve
matching between your printer and monitor, anyway, but to ensure color
consistency through a production workflow — that is, between different
technicians passing an image file along from creation to printing. 
 If your photography work demands more accurate color-matching con-
trols than your printer or photo-editing software delivers, you can invest
in a color-management system, or CMS, for short. Incorporating special
software and hardware tools, a CMS enables you to calibrate all the 
different components of your image-processing system — scanner, mon-
itor, and printer — so that colors stay true from machine to machine.
Among companies offering color-management products for consumers
are Colorvision (www.colorvision.com), X-Rite (www.xrite.com), and
GretagMacbeth (www.i1color.com). 

Remember, too, that even the best color-matching system can’t deliver
100-percent accuracy because of the inherent difference between creat-
ing colors with light and reproducing them with ink. 
These same comments apply to the color-management systems that
may be included free with your operating-system software, such as
ColorSync on the Mac.
 If your monitor enables you to adjust the screen display, try this proce-
dure to get your printer and monitor more in sync. Print a color image and
then hold the image up next to the monitor. Compare the printed picture
with the one on-screen and then adjust the monitor settings until the two
fall more in line. But remember that this process is a little backwards in
that it calibrates the monitor to the printer rather than the other way
around. So if you print your image on another printer, your colors may
shift dramatically from what you see on the monitor.
 Finally, remember that the colors you see both on-screen and on paper
vary depending on the light in which you view them.
Preparing a TIFF Copy for Publication
In order to submit your photo to a newsletter or other print publication, you
may need to provide the file in the TIFF format. You may also need to convert
the file to TIFF to use it in some page-layout and publishing programs.
To create a TIFF copy of an original file, open the image in your photo editor
and choose File➪Save As to make your copy.
In Elements, the exact steps are as follows. If you’re using another program,
the options discussed in Steps 4 and 6 should be the same, although the order
in which they appear may differ:
1. If you have made any changes to the file since the last time you saved,
save those changes.
In Elements, for example, save the file in the PSD format, making sure to
select the Layers check box to preserve layers, if your image contains
them. (Chapter 13 explains layers.) 
2. Choose File➪Save As.
Be sure to choose Save As, not just File➪Save; otherwise, your program
simply resaves the file at its current settings.
3. In the Save As dialog box, give the file a name and choose the storage
location, as usual.
205
Chapter 9: Can I Get a Hard Copy, Please?

206
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
4. Choose TIFF as the file format.
5. This time, if your file contains layers, select the option that merges all
those layers into one.
Many programs can’t open layered TIFF files, so it’s best to merge all
the layers in your TIFF copy. In Elements, turn off the Layers check box.
Assuming that you saved the original image as instructed in Step 1, the
layers in your original are unaffected by this step. (Not all programs allow
you to keep layers independent when you save to the TIFF format, so if
you don’t see this option, don’t worry about it. In some programs, you
may not get access to the option until the next step.)
6. Click Save.
When you do, you’re presented with some additional options. These vary
depending on the program, but in most cases, they include the options
shown in Figure 9-12. This is the TIFF Options dialog box from Photoshop
Elements.
Figure 9-12: For the widest compatibility with other 
programs, use these TIFF options when saving your file.

7. Set the format options as follows:
• Image Compression: Choose None. The LZW option is also safe in
terms of preserving all your image data, but some programs can’t
open files saved with LZW.
• Byte Order: Choose IBM PC if you know you’ll be using the file
on a Windows-based system; choose Macintosh for a Mac system.
But don’t stress too much about this one — most programs can
open either type of file.
• Save Image Pyramid: Give this one a pass, too. When enabled, it
creates a file that some programs won’t open.
• Layer Compression: If you forgot to disable the Layers box in Step 5,
choose Discard Layers and Save a Copy. If you did already disable
layers (or your image doesn’t contain multiple layers) all the Layer
Compression options are dimmed and unavailable. 
8. Click OK to complete the process.
Your original file closes, and your TIFF copy appears on-screen. Unless
you want to make further changes, just close the image.

D
igital cameras are ideal for creating pictures for on-screen display. Even
the most inexpensive, entry-level cameras can deliver enough pixels to
create good images for Web pages, online photo albums, multimedia presen-
tations, and other on-screen uses.
The process of preparing your pictures for the screen can be a
little confusing, however — in part because so many people
don’t understand the correct approach and keep passing
along bad advice to newcomers.
This chapter shows you how to do things the right
way. You find out how to set the display size of on-
screen photos, save the resized photo in the JPEG file
format, send a picture along with an e-mail message,
and more.
Step into the Screening Room
With a printed picture, your display options are fairly limited.
You can pop the thing into a frame or photo album. You can stick it
to a refrigerator with one of those annoyingly cute refrigerator magnets. Or
you can slip it into your wallet so that you’re prepared when an acquaintance
inquires after you and yours.

210
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
In their digital state, however, you can display photos in all sorts of new and
creative ways, including the following:
 On a Web page: If your company has a Web site, add interest by posting
product pictures, employee photos, and images of your corporate head-
quarters. Many folks these days even have personal Web pages devoted
not to selling products but to sharing information about themselves.
(Your Internet provider may provide you with a free page just for this
purpose.)
You can even create an online photo gallery — and you don’t need to
be an experienced Web designer, either, because many photo-editing
programs provide a wizard that practically automates the process.
Figure 10-1 shows the wizard provided in Photoshop Elements, for exam-
ple. Figure 10-2 offers a look at the finished Web page. See “Nothing but
Net: Photos on the Web,” later in this chapter, for details on preparing a
digital photo for use on a Web page.
Figure 10-1: Putting together a simple Web gallery is easy, thanks to step-by-step 
wizards provided in many photo-editing and cataloging programs.

Figure 10-2: Visitors to your gallery can click a thumbnail to display the image at a larger size.
 Via e-mail: E-mail a picture to friends, clients, or relatives, who then
can view the image on their computer screens, save the image file, and
even edit and print the photo if they like. Check out “Drop Me a Picture
Sometime, Won’t You?” later in this chapter for information on how to
attach a picture to your next e-mail missive.
 On a photo-sharing site: When you have more than a few pictures to
share, forego e-mail and instead take advantage of photo-sharing sites
such as Kodak EasyShare Gallery (www.kodakgallery.com), Snapfish
(www.snapfish.com), or Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com). Figure 10-3
offers a look at an online album that I created at the Snapfish Web site.
After uploading pictures, you can invite people to view your album and
to buy prints of their favorite photos. You generally can create and share
albums at no charge; the Web sites make a profit through their photo
printing services.
211
Chapter 10: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!

212
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Do not rely on photo-sharing sites for archival picture storage, however.
Many sites delete your pictures if you don’t buy prints within a certain
amount of time. And some sites that have had glorious beginnings went
through a bad spell and shut down, taking all their customers’ photos
with them. See Chapter 4 for information on how to properly archive
your digital files.
 In a multimedia presentation: Import the picture into a multimedia pres-
entation program such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Corel Presentations.
The right images, displayed at the right time, can add excitement and
emotional impact to your presentations and also clarify your ideas.
Check your presentation program’s manual for specifics on how to add a
digital photo to your next show.
 As a screen saver: Create a personalized screen saver featuring your
favorite images or pick a single image to use as your desktop wallpaper,
as I did for Figure 10-4, in the next section. Chapter 15 provides the step-
by-step instructions for both projects. 
Figure 10-3: Online album sites such as Snapfish offer a convenient way to share photos with 
far-flung friends and relatives.

 As a slide show: Put together a digital slide show using a specialty pro-
gram such as PhotoShow, introduced in Chapter 1. You can burn the
show to CD for playback on any computer and on some DVD players.
Many photo-editing and cataloging programs also offer a tool for making
slide shows, although they’re usually more limited than what you get in
a stand-alone program.
 On TV: With many digital cameras, you can download images to your TV,
DVD player, or VCR. You can then show your pictures to a living room
full of guests and even record your images to videotape. For information,
see the last section of this chapter.
That’s About the Size of It
Preparing pictures for on-screen display requires a different approach than
you use to get them ready for the printer. The following sections tell all.
Understanding monitor resolution and picture size
As you prepare pictures for on-screen use, remember that monitors display
images using one screen pixel for every image pixel. (If you need a primer
on pixels, flip back to Chapter 2.) The exception is when you’re working in a
photo-editing program or other application that enables you to zoom in on
a picture, thereby devoting several screen pixels to each image pixel.
Most monitors can be set to a choice of displays, each of which results in a
different number of screen pixels, or, in common lingo, a different monitor 
resolution. Standard monitor resolution settings include 640 x 480 pixels,
800 x 600 pixels, 1024 x 768 pixels, and 1280 x 1024 pixels. The first number
always indicates the number of horizontal pixels. 
To size a screen picture, you simply match the pixel dimensions of the photo
to the amount of screen real estate that you want the picture to consume.
If your photo is 800 x 600 pixels, for example, it consumes the entire screen
when the monitor resolution is set to 800 x 600. Raise the monitor resolution,
and the same photo no longer fills the screen.
For a clearer idea of how monitor resolution affects the size at which your
photo appears on-screen, see Figures 10-4 and 10-5. Both examples show an
800 x 600-pixel digital photo as it appears on a 19-inch monitor. I used the
Windows Desktop Properties control to display the photo as my Windows
desktop background, or wallpaper, in geek speak. (See Chapter 15 for how-
to’s.) In Figure 10-4, I set the monitor resolution to 800 x 600. The image fills
the entire screen (although the Windows taskbar hides a portion of the image
at the bottom of the frame). In Figure 10-5, I displayed the same picture but
switched the monitor resolution to 1600 x 1200. The image now eats up one-
fourth of the screen. A higher screen resolution means smaller screen pixels,
so everything appears smaller — including your photo.
213
Chapter 10: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!

214
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Figure 10-4: An 800 x 600-pixel digital photo fills the screen when the monitor resolution is set
to 800 x 600.
Unfortunately, you often don’t have any way to know or control what monitor
resolution will be in force when your audience views your pictures. Someone
viewing your Web page in one part of the world may be working on a 21-inch
monitor set at a resolution of 1280 x 1024, while another someone may be
working on a 13-inch monitor set at a resolution of 640 x 480. So you just have
to strike some sort of compromise.
For Web and e-mail images, I recommend sizing your photos assuming a 
640 x 480 monitor resolution — the least common denominator, if you will.
If you create an image larger than 640 x 480, people who use a monitor reso-
lution of 640 x 480 have to scroll the display back and forth to see the entire
photo. Of course, if you’re preparing images for a multimedia presentation
and you know what monitor resolution you’ll be using, work with that display
in mind. For online use, also keep in mind that the Web browser or e-mail
window itself takes up some of the available screen space.

Figure 10-5: At a monitor resolution of 1600 x 1200, an 800 x 600-pixel photo consumes one-
quarter of the screen.
Sizing images for the screen
Some digital cameras offer an option that automatically creates two copies
of each image: one with lots of pixels for making prints, and another that has
the appropriate number of pixels for e-mail or Web use. But if your camera
doesn’t offer this feature, you can easily make a resized copy of a photo for
online sharing. 
Here’s how to do the job in Photoshop Elements:
1. Save a backup copy of your picture.
In all likelihood, you’re going to trim pixels from your photo for on-screen
display. You may want those original pixels back someday, so save a copy
of the picture with a different name before you go any further.
2. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size to display the Image Size dialog box.
215
Chapter 10: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!

216
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
3. Select the Resample Image check box, as shown in Figure 10-6.
This option, when turned on, enables you to resample the picture — that
is, to add or delete pixels. After you select the option (by clicking the
check box), the Pixel Dimensions area at the top of the dialog box offers
a set of Width and Height controls, as shown in the figure. You use these
controls to add or delete pixels in Step 6.
Figure 10-6: To add or delete pixels in Photoshop Elements, select 
the Resample Image check box.
4. Select Bicubic from the drop-down list next to the Resample Image
option.
The options in this list affect the method the program uses when
adding and deleting pixels. Bicubic, the default setting, produces the
best results when you’re trimming pixels. If you’re adding pixels, use
Bicubic Smoother.
5. Select the Constrain Proportions check box, as shown in the figure.
This option makes sure that the original proportions of your picture are
maintained when you change the pixel count.
6. Select the Scale Styles box, if it’s available.

7. Using the top set of Width and Height boxes, enter the new pixel
dimensions for your photo.
Remember, pixel dimensions is just a nerdy way of saying “number of
pixels across by number of pixels down.”
Before setting the new pixel count, select Pixels as the unit of measure-
ment from the drop-down list next to the Width or Height box. Because
the Constrain Proportions option is turned on, the Height value automat-
ically changes when you adjust the Width value, and vice versa.
8. Click OK or press Enter.
To view your photo at the size it will display on-screen, choose View➪
Actual Pixels. Keep in mind that this view setting displays the photo
according to your current monitor resolution; if displayed on a monitor
using a different resolution, the photo size will change. For more on this
sticky bit of business, refer to the preceding section.
9. Save the resized photo in the JPEG format.
The upcoming section “JPEG: The photographer’s friend,” offers specifics
on this step. If your original image was in the JPEG format, be sure to give
the resized copy a new name so that you don’t overwrite the original file.
The steps for resizing a photo in other programs should be very similar. For
specifics, check your software’s Help system for information about how to
resample pictures. Your software may even offer a wizard that automates the
process of downsampling a picture and sending it via e-mail.
Whatever program you use to resample your photos, remember that if you
add pixels, the software has to make up — interpolate — the new pixels, and
your picture quality can suffer. Check out the information on resampling and
resolution in Chapter 2 for more details on this subject.
Also, the more pixels you have, the larger the image file. If you’re preparing
photos for the Web, file size is a special consideration because larger files
take longer to download than smaller files. See “Nothing but Net: Photos on
the Web” for more information about preparing images for use on Web pages.
Sizing screen images in inches
Newcomers to digital photography often have trouble sizing images in terms
of pixels and prefer to rely on inches as the unit of measurement. And some
photo-editing programs don’t offer pixels as a unit of measurement in their
image-size dialog boxes.
217
Chapter 10: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!

218
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
If you can’t resize your picture using pixels as the unit of measurement
or you prefer to work in inches, set the image width and height as usual
and then set the output resolution to somewhere between 72 and 96 ppi.
In Photoshop Elements, follow the same steps as outlined in the preceding
section, but set the picture size and output resolution using the Width,
Height, and Resolution boxes in the Document Size section of the Image Size
dialog box.
Where does this 72 to 96 ppi figure come from? It’s based on default monitor
resolution settings on Macintosh and PC monitors. Mac monitors usually
leave the factory with a monitor resolution that results in about 72 screen
pixels per linear inch of the viewable area of the screen. PC monitors are set
to a resolution that results in about 96 pixels for each linear inch of screen.
So if you have a 1 x 1-inch picture and set the output resolution to 72 ppi, for
example, you wind up with enough pixels to fill an area that’s one-inch square
on a Macintosh monitor.
Note that this approach is pretty unreliable because of the wide range of
monitor sizes and available monitor resolution settings — the latter of which
the user can change at any time, thereby blowing the 72/96 ppi guideline out
of the water. For more precise on-screen sizing, the method described in the
preceding section is the way to go.
Nothing but Net: Photos on the Web
If your company operates a Web site or you maintain a personal Web site,
you can easily place pictures from your digital camera onto your Web pages.
Because I don’t know which Web-page creation program you’re using, I can’t
give you specifics on the commands and tools you use to add photos to your
pages. But I can offer some advice on a general artistic and technical level,
which is just what happens in the next few sections.
Basic rules for Web pictures
If you want your Web site to be one that people love to visit, take care when
adding photos (and other graphics, for that matter). Too many images or
images that are too big quickly turn off viewers, especially viewers with
slow dialup connections. Every second that people have to wait for a picture
to download brings them a second closer to giving up and moving on from
your site.
To make sure that you attract, not irritate, visitors to your Web site, keep
these nuggets of information in mind:

 For business Web sites, make sure that every image you add is neces-
sary. Don’t junk up your page with lots of pretty pictures that do nothing
to convey the message of your Web page — in other words, images that
are pure decoration. These kinds of images waste the viewer’s time and
cause people to click away from your site in frustration.
 If you use a picture as a hyperlink, also provide a text-based link.
(A hyperlink, in case you’re new to the Internet, is a graphic or bit of text
that you click to travel to another Web page.) This suggestion applies
whether you use a single image as a link or combine several images
into a multi-link graphic, or image map. Why the need for both image
and text links? Because many people with slow Internet connections set
their browsers so that images do not automatically download. Images
appear as tiny icons that the viewer can click to display the entire image.
This setup reduces the time required for a Web page to load. But without
those text links, people can’t navigate your site unless they take the time
to load each image.
 Save Web-bound photos in the JPEG file format. This format produces
the best-looking on-screen pictures, and all Web browsers can display
JPEG files. Two other photo formats, PNG (pronounced ping) and JPEG
2000, are in development, but not fully supported by either browsers or
Web-page creation programs yet.
 Don’t save photos in the GIF format. If you’re familiar with Web design,
you may be wondering about using the GIF format for your online photos.
GIF, which stands for Graphics Interchange Format, is a great format for
small graphics, such as logos. But it’s not good for photos because a GIF
image can contain only 256 colors. As a result, photos can turn splotchy
when saved to this format, as illustrated by Figure 10-7.
People argue about whether to say jiff, as in jiffy, or gif, with a hard g. I
go with jiff because my research turned up evidence that the creators of
the format intended that pronunciation. But I don’t care how you say GIF
as long as you remember not to use it for your Web photos. 
 Understand how pixel count affects display size. Set the display size of
your photos following the guidelines discussed earlier in “Sizing images
for the screen.” To accommodate the widest range of viewers, size your
images with respect to a screen display of 640 x 480 pixels. Don’t forget
that the Web browser or e-mail program needs part of the available screen
space. For e-mail pictures, I suggest a maximum image width of 300 pixels
and a maximum height of 250 pixels.
Note that with this low pixel count, people can’t make a decent print
from your pictures. Consider using a photo-sharing Web site instead of
e-mail if you want people to have the option of printing your photos.
 File size determines how long it takes other people to download your
pictures. It also determines how long you sit and wait for pictures to
make it from your computer to the Web.
219
Chapter 10: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!

220
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 Pixel count, not ppi, determines file size. File size is determined by the
total number of pixels in the image, not the output resolution (pixels per
inch, or ppi). The file size of a 640 x 480-pixel image is the same at 72 ppi
as it is at 300 ppi. Check out Chapter 2 for a more detailed explanation of
all this file-size, pixel-count, and output resolution stuff.
 Increasing the amount of JPEG compression is another way to reduce
file size. The next section explains this option.
 If you want to control the use of your photos, think twice about posting
them online. Remember, anyone who visits your page can download,
save, edit, print, and distribute your image — without your knowledge or
approval. To prevent unauthorized use of your pictures, you may want to
investigate digital watermarking and copyright protection services. To
start learning about such products, visit the Web site of one of the lead-
ing providers, Digimarc (www.digimarc.com). The Web site operated by
the organization Professional Photographers of America (www.ppa.com)
provides good background information on copyright issues in general.
Figure 10-7: For better-looking Web photos, use the JPEG file format (top). GIF images can
contain only 256 colors, which can leave photos looking splotchy (bottom). 

JPEG: The photographer’s friend
JPEG (jay-peg) is the standard format used by digital cameras to store picture
files. If you don’t need to resize your JPEG originals, you can share them via
e-mail or post them on a Web page immediately. All Web browsers and e-mail
programs can display JPEG photos.
Chances are, though, that your originals are too large for on-screen use, which
means that you need to dump some pixels, following the instructions earlier
in this chapter. After you take that step — or do any other photo editing —
you must resave the file in the JPEG format before sharing it online. 
When you save a file in the JPEG format, the picture undergoes lossy compres-
sion. This feature creates smaller file sizes by dumping some image data, which
can reduce picture quality. (Chapter 5 offers an illustration.) So before you
save an image in the JPEG format, create a backup copy using a file format
that doesn’t use lossy compression — TIFF, for example, or the Photoshop
Elements format (PSD), if you use that program.
As an alternative, you can simply resave the file in the JPEG format, but using
a new filename. Don’t take that route if your file contains layers, however;
saving to JPEG merges layers. (For an explanation of layers, see Chapter 13.)
221
Chapter 10: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
Would you like that picture all at once, 
or bit by bit?
When you save a picture in the JPEG format
inside a photo editor, you usually encounter an
option that enables you to specify whether you
want to create a progressive image. This feature
determines how the picture loads on a Web page.
With a progressive JPEG, a faint representation
of your image appears as soon as the initial
image data makes its way through the viewer’s
modem. As more and more image data is
received, the picture details are filled in bit by
bit. With nonprogressive images, no part of your
image appears until all image data is received.
Progressive images create the perception that
the image is being loaded faster because the
viewer has something to look at sooner. This
type of photo also enables Web-site visitors to
decide more quickly whether the image is of
interest to them and, if not, to move on before
the image download is complete.
However, progressive images take longer to
download fully, and some Web browsers don’t
handle them well. In addition, progressive JPEGs
require more RAM (system memory) to view. For
these reasons, most Web design experts rec-
ommend that you don’t use progressive images
on your Web pages.
If you decide to go with the GIF format instead of
JPEG, by the way, you encounter an option
called interlacing, which has the same result as
a progressive JPEG. For reasons illustrated ear-
lier in this chapter (refer to Figure 10-7), I don’t
recommend using GIF for photos, but if you do,
don’t create interlaced files.

222
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
The following steps show you how to use the Photoshop Elements Save for
Web utility, introduced earlier in this chapter, to save your picture in the JPEG
format. Using this feature enables you to see how much damage your picture
will suffer at various levels of JPEG compression. If you’re using another image
editor, check the Help system for the exact commands to use to save to JPEG.
The available JPEG options should be much the same as described here,
although you may or may not be able to preview the compression effects on
your picture.
1. Choose File➪Save for Web to display the Save for Web dialog box,
shown in Figure 10-8.
The preview on the left side of the dialog box shows your original pic-
ture; the right-side preview shows how your photo will look when saved
at the current settings.
2. Select JPEG from the Format drop-down list, labeled in Figure 10-8.
After you select JPEG, you see the other save options shown in the
figure.
3. Set the compression amount by using the Quality controls labeled in
the figure.
A higher Quality setting results in less compression and a larger file.
The Quality drop-down list offers five general settings: Maximum, Very
High, High, Medium, and Low. Maximum provides the best picture qual-
ity/least compression; Low provides the least quality/most compression.
If you want to get a little more specific, use the Quality slider on the right.
You can specify any Quality value from 0 to 100, with 0 giving you the
lowest image quality (maximum compression) and 100 the best image
quality (least compression). 
As you adjust either control, the right preview in the dialog box updates
to show you the impact on your photo. Beneath the preview, the program
displays the approximate file size and download time at a specific modem
speed. To specify the modem speed, open the Preview menu, labeled in
Figure 10-8.
4. Turn off the Progressive and ICC Profile check boxes.
If you see a check mark in a box, click the box to remove the check mark
and turn off the option. For reasons discussed in the earlier sidebar,
“Would you like that picture all at once, or bit by bit?” progressive JPEG
files aren’t a good idea. The ICC Profile option has to do with some color
management issues that professional imaging folks may want to investi-
gate, but us ordinary mortals don’t need to worry about. In addition, the
option adds to the file size.

Figure 10-8: The Quality settings determine how much compression is applied.
5. If your picture contains transparent areas, choose a Matte color.
This feature comes into play only if the bottom layer of your picture 
contains transparent areas. (See Chapter 13 for the scoop on layers
and layer transparency.) JPEG files can’t preserve transparency, so
transparent areas are filled with the color you choose from the Matte
drop-down list — white, if you don’t select another color. 
Click to open Preview menu

Chapter 10: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!

224
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
If you’re placing the photo on a Web page that has a solid-colored back-
ground, you can make the transparent parts of a JPEG photo appear to
retain their transparency, however. Just match the Matte color to the
color of your Web page background. The viewer’s eye then can’t tell
where the image stops and the Web page begins.
6. Click OK.
The Save for Web dialog box disappears, and the Save Optimized As
dialog box comes to life. This dialog box works like any file-saving dialog
box. Just give your picture a filename and specify where you want to
store the file. The correct file format is already selected for you.
7. Click Save or press Enter.
The program saves the JPEG copy of your picture. Your original photo
remains open and on-screen. If you want to see the new JPEG version,
you have to open that file.
Drop Me a Picture Sometime, Won’t You?
Being able to send digital photos to friends and family around the world via
e-mail is one of the most enjoyable aspects of owning a digital camera. With a
few clicks of your mouse, you can send an image to anyone who has an e-mail
account.
Although attaching a digital photo to an e-mail message is really simple, the
process sometimes breaks down due to differences in e-mail programs and
how files are handled on the Mac versus the PC. Also, newcomers to the world
of electronic mail often get confused about how to view and send images —
which isn’t surprising, given that e-mail software often makes the process
less than intuitive.
One way to help make sure that your image arrives intact is to prepare it
properly before sending. First, size your image according to the guidelines
discussed earlier in this chapter in “That’s About the Size of It.” Also, save
your resized image in the JPEG format, as explained in the preceding section. 
Note that these instructions don’t apply to pictures that you’re sending
to someone who needs to use the image for some professional graphics 
purpose — for example, if you created an image for a client who plans to put
it in a company newsletter. In that case, save the image file in whatever format
the client needs, and use the output resolution appropriate for the final output,
as explained in Chapter 2. If you want the recipient of your e-mail to produce
a decent print, you can still use the JPEG format, but you can’t reduce the
pixel count as you do for only on-screen viewing. Either way, you’re going to
be sending a large file and should expect long download times unless you
have a high-speed Internet connection. With a dialup connection, putting the
image on a Zip disk, CD, or some other removable storage medium and send-
ing it off via overnight mail may be a better option than e-mail transmission.

That said, the following steps explain how to attach an image file to an e-mail
message in Microsoft Outlook Express Version 6.0. (If you’re using another
version or some other e-mail program, the process is probably very similar,
but check your program’s Help system for specific instructions.)
1. Connect to the Internet and fire up Outlook Express.
2. Choose File➪New➪Mail Message.
You’re presented with a blank mail window.
3. Enter the recipient’s name, e-mail address, and subject information as
you normally do.
4. Choose Insert➪File Attachment or click the Attach File button on the
toolbar, labeled in Figure 10-9.
Most programs provide such a toolbar button — look for a button that
has a paper clip icon on it. The paper clip has become the standard icon
to represent the attachment feature.
You then see a dialog box that looks much like the one you normally use
to locate and open a file. Track down the image file that you want to
attach, select it, and click Attach. You’re then returned to the message
composition window.

If everything goes right, your e-mail
recipient should receive the image in
no time. In Outlook Express, the image
either appears as an inline graphic —
that is, it is displayed right in the
e-mail window as in Figure 10-10 — or
as a text link that the user clicks to
display the image.
But as mentioned earlier, several
technical issues can throw a monkey
wrench into the process. If the image
doesn’t arrive as expected or can’t be
viewed, the first thing to do is call the
tech support line for the recipient’s
e-mail program or service. Find out
whether you need to follow any spe-
cial procedures when sending images
and verify that the recipient’s soft-
ware is set up correctly. If everything
seems okay on that end, contact your
own e-mail provider or software tech
support. Chances are, some e-mail
setting needs to be tweaked, and the
tech support personnel should be
able to help you resolve the problem
quickly.
Viewing Your Photos on a TV
If you’ve shopped for a DVD player recently, you may have spotted an inter-
esting new feature on a few models: a slot that accepts some types of digital
camera media. You can pop a memory card out of your camera, into the DVD
player, and view all the pictures on the card on your television set.
For those without the latest in home electronics technology, many cameras
come with a video-out port and video connection cable. Translated into English,
that means that you can connect the camera itself to a DVD player or regular
old TV to display your digital photos. You can even connect the camera to a
VCR and record your images on videotape.
Why would you want to display your images on a TV? Here are a couple 
reasons:
Figure 10-10: Use a maximum height of 250
pixels and a maximum width of 300 pixels
when e-mailing pictures.

 You can show your pictures to a group of people in your living room or
office conference room instead of having them huddle around your com-
puter monitor.
 You can review your images more closely than you can on your camera’s
LCD monitor. Small defects that may not be noticeable on the camera
monitor become readily apparent when viewed on a 27-inch television
screen.
As with connecting the camera to a computer, consult your camera’s manual
for specific instructions on how to hook your camera to the DVD player, TV,
or VCR. Typically, you plug one end of an AV cable (supplied with the camera)
into the camera’s video- or AV-out port and then plug the other end into the
video-in port on your TV, DVD player, or VCR, as shown in Figure 10-11. If your
camera has audio-recording capabilities, the cable has a separate AV plug for
the audio signal. That plug goes into the audio-in port. If your playback device
supports stereo sound, you typically plug the camera’s audio plug into the
mono-input port.
Figure 10-11: Many cameras enable you to send video signals from the camera to your TV,
VCR, or DVD player for playback.
227
Chapter 10: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!

228
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
To display your pictures on the TV, you generally use the same procedure as
when reviewing your pictures on the camera’s LCD monitor, but again, check
your manual. You may need to set your TV’s input signal to the auxiliary input
mode; look in your TV manual to find out how to do this.
To record the images on videotape, just put the VCR in record mode, turn on
the camera, and display each image for the length of time you want to record
it. You may need to select a different input source for the VCR — for example,
to switch the VCR from its standard antenna or cable input setting to its aux-
iliary input setting.
Most digital cameras sold in North America output video in NTSC format,
which is the format used by televisions in North America. You can’t display
NTSC images on televisions in Europe and other countries that use the PAL
format instead of NTSC. So if you’re an international business mogul needing to
display your images abroad, you may not be able to do it using your camera’s
video-out feature. Some newer cameras do provide you with the choice of
NTSC or PAL formats.
You can view your photos on TV even if your camera doesn’t offer a video-
out feature or your DVD player doesn’t offer memory-card slots, by the way.
Several companies sell image-viewing devices designed just for this purpose.
Figure 10-12 shows one such product, the SanDisk Photo Album ($50, www.
sandisk.com). Some camera docking stations also offer video-out ports; see
Chapter 4 for more information on docking stations.

Tricks of the
Digital Trade

In this part . . .
I
f you watch many spy movies, you may have
noticed that image editing has worked its way
into just about every plot line lately. Typically, the
story goes like this: A Mel Gibson-type hero snags
a photograph of the bad guys. But the photograph
is taken from too far away to clearly identify the
villains. So Mel takes the picture to a buddy who
works as a digital-imaging specialist in a top-secret
government lab. Miraculously, the buddy is able to
enhance the picture enough to give Mel a crystal-
clear image of his prey, and soon all is well for
Earth’s citizens. Except for the buddy, that is, who
invariably gets killed by the villains just moments
after Mel leaves the lab.
I’m sorry to say that, in real life, image edit-
ing doesn’t work that way. Maybe top-secret 
government-types have software that can per-
form the tricks you see in movies — hey, for all I
know, our agents really have ray guns and secret
decoder rings, too. But the image editors available
to you and me simply can’t create photographic
details out of nothing.
That doesn’t mean that you can’t perform some
pretty amazing feats, though, as this part of the
book illustrates. Chapter 11 shows you how to do
minor touch-up work, such as cropping your image
and correcting color balance. Chapter 12 explains
how to apply edits to just part of your image by
creating selections, how to cut and paste two or
more images together, and how to cover up minor
image ﬂaws and unwanted background elements.
Chapter 13 gives you a taste of some advanced
editing techniques, such as painting on your
image, creating photographic montages, and
applying special-effects ﬁlters.

O
ne of the great things about digital photography is
that you’re never limited to the image that comes
out of the camera, as you are with traditional photog-
raphy. With film, a lousy picture stays lousy forever.
Sure, you can get one of those little pens to cover
up red-eye problems, and if you’re really good with
scissors, you can crop out unwanted portions of
the picture. But that’s about the extent of the cor-
rections you can do without a full-blown film lab at
your disposal.
With a digital image and a basic photo-editing program,
however, you can do amazing things to your pictures with
surprisingly little effort. In addition to cropping, color bal-
ancing, and adjusting brightness and contrast, you can cover up
distracting background elements, bring back washed-out colors, paste
two or more images together, and apply all sorts of special effects.

232
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Chapter 12 explains how to cover up image blemishes and how to paste
photos together, while Chapter 13 explores painting tools, special-effects fil-
ters, and other advanced photo-editing techniques. This chapter explains the
basics: simple tricks you can use to correct minor defects in your pictures.
What Software Do You Need?
In this chapter, and in others that describe specific photo-editing tools, I
show you how to get the job done using Adobe Photoshop Elements. I chose
this software for two reasons. First, it costs less than $100, yet offers many
of the same features found in the more sophisticated (and more expensive)
Adobe Photoshop, the leading professional-level photo editor. In addition,
Elements is available for both Windows-based and Macintosh computers,
which is a rarity in today’s Windows-centric computing world.
A few additional notes about the photo-editing instructions in this book:
 Steps and illustrations feature Elements 3.0. However, if you’re using
another version of the program, the core components are much the
same, although Version 3.0 introduced a few new tools.
 Text marked with an Elements How-To icon relates specifically to
Elements. This book is just intended to help you get your feet wet
with Elements, however. If you want to dig deeper into the program,
many excellent books are available, and the built-in Help system is
quite good as well. (Choose Help➪Photoshop Elements Help.)
 In figures, the Elements toolbox appears as a one-column affair, as shown
in Figure 11-1, while yours may occupy two columns. The arrangement
depends on the size of the program window; if the window is small, the
toolbox shrinks itself in height so that you can see the entire toolbox at
all times.
 In addition, I hid the Palette Bin and Photo Bin to leave more room for
the image itself. You can hide and display these components via the
Window menu. On a Mac, you also can hide the toolbox and options bar,
labeled in Figure 11-1, but while working with this book, display those
two features.
 Finally, my instructions assume that you’re working in Standard Edit
mode; click the Standard Edit button at the right end of the toolbar to
make it so.

Figure 11-1: Hiding the Palette Bin and Photo Bin allows more room for your photos.
Readers who own Adobe Photoshop will find that many of that program’s tools
work exactly as they do in Elements, although Photoshop sometimes offers a
broader array of tool options than Elements. If you use a photo editor other
than Elements or Photoshop, be assured that you can easily adapt the infor-
mation provided in this book to your software. Most photo-editing programs
provide similar tools to the ones I discuss here. And the basic photo-retouching
concepts and photographic ideas are the same no matter what photo soft-
ware you prefer.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
So use this book as a guide for understanding the general approach you should
take when editing your digital pictures, and consult your software’s manual
or online Help system for the specifics of applying certain techniques.
If you don’t have any photo-editing software or you’re shopping for a new
program, you can find demo versions of several good products online. The
Web page for this book (www.dummies.com/go/digitalphotofd5E) provides
links to those products, and I’ve also posted some sample photos in case you
want to work along with the project steps.
Opening Your Photos
Before you can work on a digital photo, you have to open it inside your photo-
editing program. In just about every program on the planet, you can use the
following techniques to crack open a picture file:
 Choose File➪Open.
 Use the universal keyboard shortcut for the Open command: In
Windows, press Ctrl+O; on a Mac, press Ô+O.
 Click the Open button on the toolbar. The universal symbol for this
button is a file folder being opened. The Photoshop Elements version
of the button appears in the margin.
Whichever method you choose, the program displays the same dialog box
you see when you open files in any program. Figure 11-2 shows both the
Windows XP and Mac OS X versions of the dialog box. Click the name of the
picture file and then click the Open button.
Why is my photo software so sluggish?
Photo editing requires a substantial amount of
free RAM (system memory). If your computer
slows to a crawl when you try to open a picture,
try shutting down all programs, restarting your
computer, and then starting your photo software
only. (Be sure to disable any startup routines
that launch programs automatically in the back-
ground when you fire up your system.) Now
you’re working with the maximum RAM your
system has available. If your computer continues
to complain about a memory shortage, consider
adding more memory — memory is relatively
cheap right now, fortunately.
Understand, too, that your photo software uses
your computer’s hard drive space as well as
RAM when processing images. In Elements, you
see a message saying that your scratch disk is
full when you run out of drive space; other pro-
grams may use different terminology. In any
case, you can solve the problem by deleting
unneeded files to free up some room on the
hard drive. Another option is to buy an external
hard drive and move your less-used files to that
drive.

Figure 11-2: The Open dialog box for Windows XP (top) and Mac OS X (bottom).
Here are a few other bits of gossip related to opening images:
 Some programs, including Elements, offer a built-in file browser that you
can use to preview thumbnails of your picture files before you open them.
Figure 11-3 presents the Elements File Browser, which you display by
choosing Window➪File Browser. You can double-click a thumbnail to
open the picture file.
Note that in the Windows version of Elements 3, you also can view and
open pictures from the Organizer, a beefed up cousin of the File Browser.
Starting with Version 4, the File Browser is gone, and you must use the
Organizer to view picture thumbnails.
235
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable

236
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
 All the aforementioned techniques work for accessing picture files that
live on your computer’s hard drive, a CD, or other storage device. But
depending on your photo software, camera, and computer operating
system, you may be able to open images directly from your camera
(while the camera is connected to the computer). Check the program
and camera manuals to find out how to make your software and hard-
ware talk to each other. If you’ve invested in a memory card reader, you
also should be able to access files directly from the card. Chapter 8
offers more help with both scenarios.
 Most photo editors can’t handle the proprietary file formats that some
older digital cameras use to store images. Many programs also choke on
Camera Raw files. If your program refuses to open a file because of format,
check your camera manual for information about the photo-transfer soft-
ware provided with your camera. You should be able to use the software
to convert your images to a standard file format. See Chapter 8 for help
with opening Camera Raw files in Elements.
 If your picture opens on its side, use your software’s Rotate commands
to set things right. In Elements, the commands reside on the Image➪
Rotate submenu.
Figure 11-3: Choose Window➪File Browser to browse thumbnails of your 
pictures in Elements 3.0.

Editing Rules for All Seasons
Before you begin editing your digital photos, review these basic rules of 
success:
 Save a backup of your original picture file. Then you can experiment
freely, safe in the knowledge that if you really botch things, you can
return to the original version at any time.
 Save at regular intervals as you work on the photo. See the next sec-
tion to find out why and how. 
 Edit on a separate layer. If your software offers layers, copy the area
that you want to alter to a new layer before tackling a significant edit.
Then apply the edit to the duplicate. Don’t like what you see? Just delete
the layer and start over. (Chapter 13 explains what I mean by layer, in
case you’re not familiar with this term.)
 Discover selective editing. Most photo editors enable you to select a
portion of your image and then apply changes to just the selected area.
For example, if the sky in your photo is very bright but the landscape is
very dark, you can select the landscape and then increase the bright-
ness of just that area. To find out more about selecting, read Chapter 12.
 Bypass automated filters. As you explore your photo software, you will
no doubt find some “instant fix” filters. Elements, for example, offers
automatic filters that promise to correct problems with contrast, expo-
sure, and color with one click. Feel free to try these tools — who am I to
discourage you from seeking instant gratification? But understand that
automatic correction filters often produce less-than-satisfactory results,
either under- or overcompensating for problems. For this reason, most
programs also include “manual” tools that enable you to control the type
and amount of correction applied to your image.
Correcting your photo manually may take a few more seconds than using
automatic filters, but you’ll be rewarded for your efforts. Figure 11-4,
for example, shows you the result of an “automatic fix” versus what I
accomplished with manual tools. In this book, I concentrate on manual
correction tools for most projects.
Save now! Save often!
Chapter 4 discusses options for preserving your original photo files. You also
need to take precautions to preserve any changes you make to your pictures
in your photo editor.
237
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable

238
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 11-4: As is the case for many images, a one-click-fix automated filter (middle) didn’t do the job as well
as “manual” correction tools (right).
Until you save the edited picture, all your work is vulnerable. If your system
crashes, the power goes out, or some other cruel twist of fate occurs, every-
thing you did since the last time you saved the picture is lost forever. So commit
the following image-safety rules to memory:
 Saving for the first time: To save an edited picture for the first time,
choose File➪Save As. You’re presented with a dialog box in which you
can enter a name for the file and choose a storage location on disk, just
as you do when saving any other type of document.
Figure 11-5 shows the Windows and Macintosh versions of this dialog box
as it appears in Elements. Along with the standard file-saving options, you
get a few controls related to Elements features. Because of space limita-
tions, I must refer you to the Elements Help system for the lowdown on
these options. Chapter 13 tells you more about the Layers box, however.
If you don’t want to overwrite your original photo file, be sure to give
the picture a new name, choose a different file format, or store it in a
separate folder from the original.
 Saving works in progress: As you work on a photo, resave the file peri-
odically. You can usually simply press Ctrl+S (Ô+S on a Mac) to resave
the image without messing with a dialog box. Or click the Save button
on the toolbar, which looks like a floppy disk (also shown in the margin).
Do not use this tactic to save an altered file for the first time, or you over-
write the original image file.
Original
Auto Fix
Custom correction

Figure 11-5: Give your edited file a new name, format, or location to 
avoid overriding the original image file.
In most programs, you can specify a file format when you choose the Save
As command. Always save photos-in-progress in your photo editor’s native
format — that is, the program’s own file format — if one is available. In Elements
and Photoshop, the native format is PSD.
239
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable

240
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Why stick with the native format? Because it’s designed to enable the program
to process your edits more quickly. In addition, generic file formats, such as
JPEG, GIF, and TIFF, may not be able to save some of the photo features, such
as image layers. (Chapter 13 explains layers.)
Save your image in another format only when you’re completely done editing.
And before you save a file in the JPEG format, which destroys some picture
data, be sure to save a backup copy of the original in a nondestructive format,
such as TIFF or, again, your photo-editor’s native format. Chapter 10 provides
specific instructions for saving JPEG files; Chapter 9 explains file-saving options
for TIFF, which you may need to use if preparing a picture for use in a print
publishing program.
Editing safety nets
As you make your way through the merry land of photo editing, you’re bound
to take a wrong turn every now and then. Perhaps you clicked when you
should have dragged. Cut when you meant to copy. Or painted a mustache
on your boss’s face when all you intended to do was cover up a blemish.
Fortunately, most mistakes can be easily undone by using the safety nets
explored in the next several sections.
Undo
The Undo command, usually on the Edit menu, takes you one step back in
time. In many programs, you can choose Undo quickly by pressing Ctrl+Z in
Windows or Ô+Z on a Mac. The program may also offer an Undo button; the
Elements version appears in the margin.
Undo can’t bail you out of all messy situations, though. If you forget to save
a picture before you close it, you can’t use Undo to restore the work you did
before closing. Nor can Undo reverse the Save command.
Most photo programs enable you to undo a whole series of edits rather than
just one. Say that you crop your image, resize it, adjust the colors, and tweak
exposure. Later, you decide that you prefer the original size. You can go back
to the point at which you changed the size, and reverse your decision. Any
edits applied after the one you undo are also eliminated, however. If you
undo that resizing step, for example, your color and exposure adjustments
are also wiped out.
To undo a series of edits in Elements, keep clicking the Undo button on the
toolbar, choosing Edit➪Undo, or pressing Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac).

241
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable
If your image editor does not offer multiple Undo, choose Undo immediately
after you perform the edit you want to reverse. If you use another tool or
choose another command, you lose your opportunity to undo.
Redo
Change your mind about that Undo? Look for a Redo command, usually found
right next to the Undo command (try the Edit menu). Redo puts things back
to the way they were before you chose Undo.
As with Undo, some programs enable you to redo a whole series of Undo
actions, while others can reverse only the most recent application of the
Undo command. Check your software manual or Help system to find out how
much Undo/Redo flexibility you have.
If your program offers an Undo button, it no doubt provides a Redo button as
well. In Elements, you also can redo a batch of undo’s by choosing Edit➪Redo
or pressing Ctrl+Y (Ô+Y) repeatedly.
Undo History palette
Some photo editors offer a palette or window that lists your most recent
changes. You can use this tool to more easily undo a batch of edits.
In Elements, this feature is called the
Undo History palette, shown in
Figure 11-6. Display the palette by
choosing Window➪Undo History. In
the palette, click the change directly
above the one that you want to undo.
All changes after the one you click
are undone and appear dimmed in the
palette. For example, in Figure 11-6,
I undid two edits. To reverse your
decision, click the dimmed edit that
you want to restore. All edits before
that change are also restored.
By default, the History palette tracks
your last 50 actions. If you want to
change that number, visit the General
panel of the Preferences dialog box and enter a new value in the History
States box. (In Windows, choose Edit➪Preferences➪General; on a Mac,
choose Photoshop Elements➪Preferences➪General.) The higher the value,
though, the more the program taxes your computer system’s resources. In
fact, if Elements is running too slowly for your liking, try reducing the History
States value to 20 or lower.
Figure 11-6: In Elements, the History palette
tracks your recent changes.

242
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Revert to Saved
Elements offers the Edit➪Revert to Saved command, which restores your
image to the way it appeared the last time you saved it. This command is
helpful when you totally make a mess of your image and you just want to get
back to square one.
If your software doesn’t offer this command, you can accomplish the same
thing by closing your image without saving it and then reopening the image.
Straightening a Tilting Horizon
Figure 11-7 shows a common problem: a horizon line that appears to be tipping
to one side. In Elements, the fix comes via the Image➪Transform command.
Most photo editors offer a similar command, although it may go by some
other name, such as Custom Rotation. The idea is the same no matter what
the name.
If you also want to crop your photo, fix the horizon line first. You lose a por-
tion of your picture when you straighten it, so you want to start with as much
original image area as possible.
Figure 11-7: A tipping horizon line spoils this shot (left), but is easily fixed (right).

Follow these steps to straighten your photo:
1. Choose Select➪All to select the entire image.
2. Select the Move tool (labeled in Figure 11-8 and shown in the margin).
Actually, you can use any tool except the Cookie Cutter or the Custom
Shape tool for this step.
3. Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
A box with square handles appears around the image, as shown in
Figure 11-8.
4. Move your cursor outside a corner handle to display a curved, two-
headed arrow cursor.
Labeled in Figure 11-8, this is the Elements rotate cursor.
5. Drag up or down to rotate the image.

6. Press Enter or click the Commit check mark to apply the rotation.
Should you want to cancel out of the change, click the Cancel button or
just press Esc. Figure 11-8 labels the Commit and Cancel buttons.
As you can see from Figure 11-8, the rotation clips away part of your
photo. The empty area takes on the background paint color, which is
white in the example. (See Chapter 13 for details about paint colors.)
7. Crop away the empty areas of the image.
The next section explains this step.
Cream of the Crop
Chapter 7 offers tips on photo composition. But if you’re not happy with the
composition you created when you took a picture, you may be able to improve
it by cropping.
Figure 11-9 offers an example. In this photo, my lovely nieces get lost in all
that pool water. The older one encouraged me to walk into the pool for a
tighter shot, but somehow that didn’t seem like a good idea, given that I was
using an $800 camera that wasn’t mine! Instead, I stayed put and later cropped
the picture to produce the more pleasing image in Figure 11-10.
Figure 11-9: Suffering from an excess of boring background, this image 
begs for some cropping.

The following steps explain how to give your
image a haircut using the Elements Crop tool.
Every photo program offers a comparable tool,
most of which work similarly to the Elements
version.
1. Pick up the Crop tool.
Click the Crop tool icon in the toolbox,
labeled in Figure 11-11, and shown in the
margin. Make sure that the Width, Height,
and Resolution boxes on the options bar
are empty, as shown in the figure. If not,
click the Clear button.
2. Drag to create a crop boundary around
the area you want to keep.
Drag from one corner of the area you want
to keep to the other corner, as shown in
Figure 11-11.

246
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
After you complete your drag, you see a square handle at each corner
of the crop boundary, as in Figure 11-12, and the area outside the crop
boundary becomes shaded.
Figure 11-12: Drag a crop handle to adjust the boundary.
3. Drag the crop handles to adjust the crop boundary as needed.
To move the entire boundary, drag anywhere inside the outline.
4. Click the Commit check mark (labeled in Figure 11-12) or press Enter.
If you want to crop a picture to fit a particular frame size in Elements, bypass
the Crop tool and instead use this technique:
1. Choose the Rectangular Marquee tool, labeled in Figure 11-13.
If the Elliptical Marquee appears in the toolbox instead of the Rectangular
Marquee, press and hold on the triangle on the tool icon to display a
flyout menu. Then click the Rectangular Marquee icon on the flyout.
2. Choose Fixed Aspect Ratio from the Mode drop-down list on the
options bar.
Commit
Handle

3. Enter the desired proportions in the Width and Height boxes on the
options bar.
For example, to create a picture for a 4 x 6-inch frame, enter 4 and 6 into
the boxes, as shown in Figure 11-13. Set the other options bar controls
as shown in the figure.
4. Drag to enclose the portion of the photo you want to keep in a dotted
outline, as shown in Figure 11-13.
That outline is the selection outline, which I explain more in the next
chapter. Elements restricts the outline so that it matches the propor-
tions you entered in the Width and Height boxes. You can reposition the
outline by dragging inside it.
5. Choose Image➪Crop.
Everything outside the selection outline is cropped away.
Whether you use this method or work with the Crop tool, keep image reso-
lution in mind. You want enough pixels remaining to produce a good print.
How much of the original image you need to keep depends on the initial pixel
count. For help with this issue, see Chapter 2.

Fixing Exposure and Contrast
At first glance, the underexposed picture on the left side of Figure 11-14
appears to be a throwaway. But don’t give up on images like this, because
you may be able to rescue that too-dark image, as I did here. The next three
sections explain how to use a variety of exposure-repair tools.
Figure 11-14: An underexposed image (left) sees new light (right).
Basic brightness/contrast controls
Many photo-editing programs offer one-shot brightness/contrast filters that
adjust your image automatically. As mentioned earlier, these automatic cor-
rection tools tend to do too much or too little and, depending on the image,
can even alter image colors dramatically.
Fortunately, most programs also provide exposure controls that enable you
to specify the extent of the correction. These controls are easy to use and
almost always produce better results than the automatic variety.

The most basic exposure and contrast tools work like the Elements Brightness/
Contrast filter, found on the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting menu and shown in
Figure 11-15. You just drag the sliders to adjust brightness or contrast.
Although the Brightness/Contrast filter is easy to use, it’s not always a terrific
solution because it adjusts all pixels by the same amount. That’s fine for some
pictures, but often, you don’t need to make wholesale exposure changes. For
example, in the too-dark image shown in Figure 11-14, the shadows are where
they need to be, exposure-wise. Only the highlights and midtones — areas of
medium brightness — need lightening.
Figure 11-15: Raising the Brightness and Contrast values brought midtones into an acceptable range, but
also blew out all color in the sky.

Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable

250
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
In the left image in Figure 11-15, I raised the Brightness value enough to get the
midtones to the right level. Pixels that were formerly very light become white,
and pixels that used to be black jump up the brightness scale to dark gray.
The result is a decrease in contrast and a loss of detail in the highlights and
shadows. Raising the Contrast value only made the situation worse, as shown
in the right image in the figure. The contrast shift amped up the highlights way
too much, blew out detail in the sky, and caused the distant mountaintop to
virtually disappear.
When pictures need selective exposure adjustments, you have a couple of
options:
 If your photo editor offers a Brightness/Contrast filter only, use the tech-
niques outlined in Chapter 12 to select the area that you want to alter
before applying the filter. That way, your changes affect the selected
pixels only.
 If you use Elements, Photoshop, or some other advanced photo editor,
check out the next two sections, which introduce you to two more
sophisticated tools, the Levels filter and the Shadows/Highlights filter. 
 You may have access to several additional tools to wield against under-
or overexposed images. For example, Elements offers Dodge and Burn
tools, which enable you to “paint” lightness or darkness onto your image
by dragging over it with your mouse. Check your software manual for
information about using these exposure tools.
What’s an adjustment layer?
Some photo-editing programs, including
Photoshop Elements, offer adjustment layers.
Adjustment layers enable you to apply exposure
and color-correction filters to a photo in a way
that doesn’t permanently alter the picture. You
can go back at any time and easily change the
filter settings or even remove the filter. In addition,
you can use layer blending features to soften the
impact of a filter. You also can easily expand the
image area affected by the filter or remove the
filter entirely from just a portion of the picture.
I don’t have room in this book to cover adjustment
layers, but I urge you to get acquainted with them
if your photo software provides this feature. Using
adjustment layers may seem a little complicated
at first, but after you get the hang of using them,
you’ll appreciate the added flexibility and con-
venience they offer. For an explanation of layers
in general, see Chapter 13.

Brightness adjustments at higher Levels
Advanced photo-editing programs provide a Levels filter, which enables you
to darken shadows, brighten highlights, and adjust midtones (areas of medium
brightness) independently. Depending on your software, the Levels filter may
go by another name; check the manual or online help system to find out
whether you have a Levels-like function. In Elements, choose Enhance➪
Adjust Lighting➪Levels to access the filter.
When you apply this filter, you typically see a dialog box that’s full of strange-
sounding options, graphs, and such. Figure 11-16 shows the Levels dialog box
from Elements, along with the original too-dark image from the preceding sec-
tion. Don’t be intimidated — after you know what’s what, the controls are
easy to use. 
The chart-like thing in the middle of the dialog box is a histogram. A histogram
maps out all brightness values in the image, with the darkest pixels plotted on
the left side of the graph and the brightest pixels on the right. The histogram
in Figure 11-16 reveals a heavy concentration of pixels at the dark end of the
exposure range and a limited pixel population in the middle and high end.
Figure 11-16: Drag the sliders under the histogram to adjust shadows, midtones, and highlights independently.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Being able to read a histogram is a fun parlor game, but the real goal is to
adjust those brightness values to create a better-looking picture. Here’s what
you need to know:
 Levels dialog boxes offer separate controls for adjusting shadows,
highlights, and midtones. Often, these three controls are labeled Input
Levels. 
In Elements, you can adjust the Input Levels values by entering numbers
in the boxes above the histogram or dragging the sliders beneath the
histogram.
• Shadows: Adjust shadows by changing the value in the leftmost
Input Levels option box or dragging the corresponding slider,
labeled in Figure 11-16. Drag the slider to the right or raise the
value to darken shadows. Some programs refer to this control as
the Low Point control.
• Midtones: Tweak midtones using the middle box or slider, labeled
Midtones in Figure 11-16. Drag the slider left or raise the value to
brighten midtones; drag right or lower the value to darken them.
This control sometimes goes by the name Gamma or Midpoint 
control.
• Highlights: Manipulate the lightest pixels in the photo by chang-
ing the value in the rightmost box or dragging its slider, labeled
Highlights in the figure. To make the lightest pixels lighter, drag the
slider to the left or lower the value. In some programs, this control
goes by the name High Point control.
To produce the corrected image shown in Figure 11-17, I dragged the mid-
tones and highlights sliders to the positions shown in the dialog box.
Note that when you adjust the shadow or highlights slider in Elements,
the midtones slider moves in tandem. If you don’t like the change to the
midtones, just drag the midtones slider back to its original position.
 Adjusting Output Levels values reduces contrast. Levels dialog boxes
also may contain Output Levels options, which enable you to set the
maximum and minimum brightness values in your image. In other words,
you can make your darkest pixels lighter and your brightest pixels
darker — which usually has the unwanted effect of decreasing the con-
trast. Sometimes, you can bring an image that’s extremely overexposed
into the printable range by setting a slightly lower maximum brightness
value. However, in Elements and Photoshop, a better approach is to use
the Shadows/Highlights filter, explained next.
 Adjust all color channels together. For color pictures, you may be able
to adjust the brightness values for the red, green, and blue color chan-
nels independently. (For an explanation of channels, see Chapter 2.)

In Elements, you select the channel that you want to adjust from the
Channel drop-down list, which appears at the top of the Levels dialog
box when you’re editing a color photo. However, adjusting brightness
levels of individual channels affects the color balance of your photo
more than anything else, so I suggest that you leave the Channel option
set to RGB, as it is by default. 
Figure 11-17: I dragged the midtones and highlights sliders to these positions to create the final image.
Using the Shadows/Highlights filter
With the Levels filter, you can darken shadows and brighten highlights.
To make the opposite shift — to lighten shadows and darken highlights —
poke about your photo editor to see whether it offers something akin to
the Elements Shadows/Highlights filter, shown in Figure 11-18. This filter 
provides a more capable option than the Levels filter’s Output controls or
the Brightness/Contrast filter for coaxing details out of murky shadows or
toning down too-bright highlights. To access the filter in Elements, choose
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/Highlights.
253
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable

254
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 11-18: The Shadows/Highlights filter enables you to 
lighten shadows and darken highlights.
The street scene shown on the left in Figure 11-19 is an ideal candidate for
this filter. I used the settings shown in Figure 11-18 to bring back details for-
merly lost in the shadows.
Figure 11-19: To produce the right image, I lightened the shadows and boosted midtone
contrast slightly.

Depending on the image, you may need to apply both the Shadows/Highlights
filter and the Levels filter. For example, although the “after” image in Figure
11-19 is vastly improved from the original, I wanted to brighten the highlights
and midtones just a smidge. So I followed the Shadows/Highlight filter with
the Levels filter, as shown in Figure 11-20.
Figure 11-20: After applying the Shadows/Highlights filter, I used the Levels filter to brighten highlights and
midtones a bit.
Give Your Colors More Oomph
Images looking dull and lifeless? Toss them in the photo-editing machine
with a cup of Saturation, the easy way to turn tired, faded colors into rich,
vivid hues.
Take the image in Figure 11-21, for example. The colors just aren’t as brilliant
as they were when I shot the image. All that’s needed to give the photo the
more colorful outlook shown on the right is the Saturation command, found
in nearly every photo-editing program.
255
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable

256
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 11-21: Amping up color saturation brought more life to this photo.
To access the saturation knob in
Elements, choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation,
which opens the dialog box shown
in Figure 11-22. Be sure that the
Colorize box is not selected and
that the Preview box is selected, as
shown in the figure. Then drag the
Saturation slider to the right to
increase color intensity; drag left
to suck color out of your image.
If you select Master from the Edit
drop-down list at the top of the
dialog box, all colors in your pic-
ture receive the color boost or
reduction. You also can adjust
individual color ranges by selecting them from the list. You can tweak the
reds, magentas, yellows, blues, cyans, or greens.
Figure 11-22: Drag the Saturation slider to the right
to boost color intensity.

For spot saturation adjustments, check to see whether your software also
offers a Sponge tool. (Elements does; the tool lives near the bottom of the
toolbox.) With this tool, you can drag over the areas you want to alter to add
or decrease saturation. When using the Elements Sponge tool, set the Mode
control on the options bar to Saturate or Desaturate, depending on what you
want to do. Use the Flow control to adjust how much change the tool applies
with each drag.
Help for Unbalanced Colors
Like film photos, digital photos sometimes have color balance problems.
In other words, the pictures look too blue, too red, or too green, or exhibit
some other color sickness.
The top picture in Figure 11-23 is a
case in point. I shot the photo with a
camera that tends to emphasize blue
tones. That’s okay for pictures that
feature sky or water — who doesn’t
enjoy a bluer sky or sea? But in this
photo, which shows a portion of an
antique clover huller, the tendency
to favor blue creates an unwanted
color cast. Notice how the belts and
the top of the wooden wheel (lower-
right corner) look almost navy blue?
Trust me, navy blue belts and wheels
are not authentic aspects of antique
farm machinery.
To remove the blue cast, I used
the Variations filter in Photoshop
Elements. This color balancing tool
is found in many photo editors,
although it may go by some other
moniker, such as Color Balance. The
lower image in Figure 11-23 shows
the corrected picture after I added
red and yellow and subtracted blue
and cyan. Now the belts and wheel
look gray, as they should. The color-
balancing act also brought out the
faded red and yellow paint of the
clover huller.

To access the Variations filter, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color
Variations. The dialog box shown in Figure 11-24 appears.
Figure 11-24: Click a color-shift thumbnail to add more of that color and subtract its opposite.
The filter controls work as follows:
 You can adjust highlights, shadows, and midtones independently. Click
one of the Range buttons, labeled in Figure 11-24, to specify which com-
ponent you want to alter.
 After selecting the range, use the color-shift thumbnails, also labeled in
the figure, to adjust the colors.
To add cyan, click the Decrease Red thumbnail; to add magenta, click
the Decrease Green thumbnail. And to add yellow, click the Decrease
Blue thumbnail.

 Use the Amount slider, located underneath the Range buttons, to control
how much your picture changes with each click of a thumbnail.
 Although the Variations filter also offers controls for adjusting saturation
and exposure, you get more control over those aspects of your picture if
you instead use the techniques outlined earlier in this chapter.
Focus Adjustments (Sharpen and Blur)
Although no photo-editing software can make a terribly unfocused image
appear completely sharp, you can usually improve things a bit by using a
sharpening filter. Figure 11-25 shows an example of how a little sharpening
can give extra definition to a slightly soft image. 
The following sections explain how to sharpen your image and also how to
blur the background of an image, which has the effect of making the fore-
ground subject appear more focused.
Figure 11-25: Sharpening increases contrast to create the illusion of sharper focus.
259
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable

260
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Before I show you how to sharpen your photos, though, I want you to under-
stand what sharpening really does. Sharpening creates the illusion of sharper
focus by adding small halos along the borders between light and dark areas
of the image. The dark side of the border gets a dark halo, and the light side
of the border gets a light halo.
To see what I mean, take a look at Figure 11-26, which offers close-up views of
the original and sharpened photo from Figure 11-25. See the area where the
light gray area meets the red area? The gray side of the border gets lighter,
the red side gets darker. The border between the light gray and dark gray
areas is similarly altered.
Figure 11-26: The light side of a color boundary gets lighter; the dark side 
gets darker.
Applying sharpening filters
Sharpening tools, like other image-correction tools I discuss in this chapter,
come in both automatic and manual flavors. With automatic sharpening filters,
the program applies a preset amount of sharpening to the image. You need to
experiment with your automated filters, if provided, to see how much you get
from each, as the effect varies from program to program.
Whatever software you use, however, you’re likely to get better results by
passing over the automated sharpening filters in favor of ones that give you
the ability to control how the effect is applied.
Some programs provide you with a fairly crude manual sharpening tool. You
drag a slider one way to increase sharpening and drag in the other direction
to decrease sharpening. Elements, Photoshop, and other more advanced
photo-editing programs provide you with a much more capable filter, which
goes by the curious name of Unsharp Mask.
Sharpening halos

The Unsharp Mask filter is named after a focusing technique used in tradi-
tional film photography. In the darkroom, unsharp masking has something to
do with merging a blurred film negative — hence, the unsharp portion of the
name — with the original film positive in order to highlight the edges (areas
of contrast) in an image. And if you can figure that one out, you’re a sharper
marble than I.
Despite its odd name, Unsharp Mask gives you the best of all sharpening worlds.
You can sharpen either your entire image or just the edges — areas of high con-
trast, in imaging lingo. You also can control the size of the sharpening halos.
And of course, you get precise control over how much sharpening is done.
To use the Unsharp Mask filter in Elements, choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp
Mask. The dialog box shown in Figure 11-27 appears.
The Unsharp Mask dialog box contains three sharpening controls: Amount,
Radius, and Threshold. You find these same options in most Unsharp Mask
dialog boxes, although the option names may vary from program to program.
Here’s how to adjust the controls to apply just the right amount of sharpening:
 Amount: This value determines the intensity of the effect. Higher values
mean more intense sharpening.
 Radius: The Radius value controls
how many pixels neighboring an edge
are affected by the sharpening — in
other words, the size of the sharpen-
ing halos. Generally, stick with Radius
values in the 0.5 to 2 range. Use
values in the low end of that range for
images that will be displayed on-
screen. Values at the high end work
better for printed images.
 Threshold: This option tells the pro-
gram how much contrast must exist
between two pixels before the bound-
ary between them receives the sharp-
ening effect. By default, the value is 0,
which means that the slightest differ-
ence between pixels results in a kiss
from the sharpening fairy. As you raise
the value, fewer pixels are affected;
high-contrast areas (edges) are sharp-
ened, while the rest of the image is not.
When sharpening photos of people, experiment with Threshold settings
in the 3 to 5 range, which can help keep the subject’s skin looking smooth
and natural. If your image suffers from graininess or noise, raising the
Threshold value can enable you to sharpen your image without making
the noise even more apparent.
261
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable

results, make friends with the Unsharp
Mask filter.

262
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
The right combination of settings depends on your original photo. But be
careful not to go overboard. Too much sharpening gives the picture a rough,
grainy look. In addition, you can wind up with obvious, glowing color halos
along areas of high contrast.
Blur to sharpen?
If your main subject is slightly out of focus and applying a sharpening filter
doesn’t totally correct the problem, try this: Select everything but the main
subject, using the techniques explained in Chapter 12. Then apply a blur filter,
found in most photo-editing programs, to the rest of the picture. Often, blur-
ring the background in this way makes the foreground image appear sharper,
as illustrated in Figure 11-28. In this photo, the blur effect also makes the
busy background less distracting.
To apply this effect in Elements, choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur. You see
the dialog box shown in Figure 11-29. Just drag the Radius slider to the right
to produce a more pronounced blur; drag left to reduce the blurring effect.
Figure 11-28: Applying a slight blur to the background makes the bird appear more in focus
and also helps de-emphasize the busy background.

In case you’re wondering, the Gaussian
Blur filter is named after a mathematician
with the surname Gauss, whose name also
is used to describe a type of curve on
which the filter is based. 
Out, Out, Darned Spots!
Sit around a coffee shop with a group of
digital photographers, and you may hear
the term jaggies tossed around. Jaggies
comes from jagged, which is how digital
images appear if they’ve been overly com-
pressed or enlarged too much. Instead of
appearing smooth and seamless, pictures
have a blocky — jagged — look, especially
along curved or diagonal lines. Chapter 2 offers examples of this defect.
A related problem, referred to as noise, aliasing, artifacts, or color fringing,
depending on the accent of the speaker, shows up as random speckles or
color halos. Whatever you call it, this defect also can be caused by too much
compression. Other noise-inducers include inadequate light and a too-high
ISO setting (see Chapter 6). The left image in Figure 11-30 shows an example
of noise.
If your image exhibits either of these properties, blurring the picture slightly
can soften the defect. For noisy photos, peruse your program’s menus for a
specialized filter such as the Elements Remove Noise filter, shown in Figure
11-31. This filter blurs your image to soften noise, but in a more sophisticated
manner than regular blur filters.
In Elements, choose Filter➪Noise➪Reduce Noise to try it out. The controls
work as follows:
 Strength: Drag this slider to blur luminance noise, which is a fancy way
of referring to unnatural brightness variations.
 Preserve Details: This control determines what threshold Elements uses
to decide what level of brightness variation constitutes noise. As you
lower the value, more of your image receives the luminance blurring. 
 Reduce Color Noise: Drag this slider to the right to increase blurring of
unwanted, random color variations or speckles, known as color noise.
263
Chapter 11: Making Your Image Look Presentable
Figure 11-29: To control the amount of
blurring, use the Gaussian Blur filter.

264
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 11-30: You can often soften excessive noise (left) by applying a noise-removal filter or other blurring
filter (right).
As with all filters, the correct settings depend on your photo. To soften
the noise in Figure 11-30, I applied the filter using the settings shown in
Figure 11-31.
Also try these alternative approaches to reduce noise or jaggies:
 Apply a regular blur filter. If possible, apply the filter just to the area
where the defects are the worst so that you don’t lose image detail in
the rest of the image. (Chapter 12 introduces selection outlines, which
enable you to do this kind of selective editing.) Or, if your program offers
a Blur tool, you can “rub away” noise by just dragging your mouse over
the areas you want to blur. (Elements offers this tool.)
 Apply a Despeckle filter. Many photo editors provide a Despeckle filter,
which essentially applies a slight blur to the image. Try applying both a
regular blur filter and Despeckle and see which one does a better job on
the image. One filter may blur more than the other.

Figure 11-31: The Reduce Noise filter tackles both luminance noise and color noise.
Whichever route you go, you may need to apply a sharpening filter to restore
lost focus after you blur away noise or other defects. The problem is, sharp-
ening can make those defects visible again. If your image editor offers an
Unsharp Mask filter, you can avoid this vicious cycle by raising the Threshold
value above the default setting, 0.

emember the O.J. Simpson trial (how could you not)? At one point in the
trial, the defense claimed that a photograph had been digitally altered
to make it appear as though the defendant wore a specific type of shoe. That
kind of claim, together with the development of photo-editing software that
makes digital deception easy to accomplish, has led many people
to question whether a photo can still be trusted to provide a
truthful record of an event.
I can’t remember the outcome of the shoe debate, but I
can tell you that a photograph can just as easily speak
a thousand lies as a thousand words. Of course, 
photographers have always been able to alter the
public’s perception of a subject simply by changing
the camera angle, backdrop, or other compositional
elements of a picture. But with photo-editing soft-
ware, opportunities for putting your own spin on a
photograph are greatly expanded.
This chapter introduces some basic methods that you
can use to manipulate your pictures. I want to emphasize
that you should use these techniques for creative expression,
not for the purpose of deceit. Combining elements from four or five
pictures to make a collage of your vacation memories is one thing; altering a
photo of a house to cover up a big crater in the driveway before you place a
for-sale ad in the real-estate section is quite another.

268
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
That said, this chapter shows you how to merge several pictures into one,
move a subject from one photo to another, and cover up image flaws. Along
the way, you get an introduction to selections, which enable you to perform
all the aforementioned editing tricks, and more.
Why (And When) Do I Select Stuff?
If your computer were smarter, you could simply give it verbal instructions
for how you wanted your photo changed. You could say, “Take my head and
put it on Madonna’s body,” and the computer would do your bidding.
Computers can do that sort of thing on Star Trek and in spy movies. But in
real life, computers aren’t that clever. If you want your computer to alter a
portion of a photo, you have to draw the machine a picture — well, not a 
picture, exactly, but a selection outline. This process is called selecting.
Selecting tells your software which pixels to change and which pixels to leave
alone. For example, in Figure 12-1, I wanted to brighten the monument but
leave the sky alone. So I selected the monument before applying the exposure
change via the Levels filter (introduced in Chapter 11).
Selections have another use, too: They protect you from yourself. Say that
you have a picture of a red flower on a green background. You decide that
you want to paint a purple stripe over the flower petals . . . oh, I don’t know
why, Johnny, maybe it’s just been that kind of day. Anyway, if you have a
steady hand, you may be able to paint only on the petals and avoid brushing
any purple on the background. But people whose hands are that steady are
usually busy wielding scalpels, not photo-editing tools. Most people tackling
the paint job get at least a few stray dabs of purple on the background.
If you select the petals before you paint, however, you can be as messy as
you like. No matter where you move your paintbrush, the paint can’t go any-
where but on those selected petals. The idea is the same as putting tape over
your baseboards before you paint your walls. Areas underneath the tape are
protected, just like pixels outside the selection outline.
On-screen, selection outlines are usually indicated by a blinking, dashed out-
line, as shown in Figure 12-1. Some people refer to the outline as a marquee,
seeing a resemblance between the outline and the lights of a theatre marquee.
Other — more imaginative — people see instead a parade of ants, and so refer
to the outline as marching ants. Still other folks call selection outlines masks;
the deselected area is said to be masked. In this book, I stick with plain ol’
selection outline.

Figure 12-1: Selecting the monument before applying the Levels filter limited the adjustment to that part of
the picture.
What selection tools should I use?
Most photo-editing programs provide you with an assortment of selection
tools. Photoshop Elements provides the following tools, which are also found
in other advanced programs (although the tool names may be different):
 Rectangular Marquee and Elliptical Marquee for creating rectangular,
square, oval, and circular selection outlines
 Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, Magnetic Lasso, and Selection Brush for draw-
ing freeform selection outlines
 Magic Wand for selecting pixels based on color
Which tool you should use depends on what you’re trying to select. The next
few sections explain how to use the various types of tools so that you can get
a better idea of what each tool can help you do.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Although I provide specific instructions related to Elements, selection tools
in other programs work similarly. So don’t skip these pages if you don’t use
Elements, because much of the information applies to your program, too.
(However, if you’re working with a very basic entry-level program, you may
get only one or two of the tools discussed here.) If you do use Elements, keep
in mind that I don’t cover all your selection possibilities due to space limita-
tions. In other words, use this chapter as a jumping-off point for exploring
your program’s selection options.
Working with Elements tools
Before getting into selecting specifics, I need to share a few words about
working with the Elements tools:
 You activate a tool by clicking its icon in the toolbox. Figure 12-2 shows
the selection tools, which live near the top of the toolbox. 
 A little triangle at the bottom of any tool icon means that two or more tools
share the same slot in the toolbox. Click the triangle, labeled in Figure 12-2,
to display a flyout menu — a little menu that flies out from the toolbox —
and access the hidden tools. Then click the icon for the tool you want to
use. The menu disappears, and the current tool appears in the toolbox.
Figure 12-2: The selection tools live near the top of the Elements toolbox.

 The options bar shows controls related to the current tool. For tools
that cohabitate in a flyout menu, the options bar also contains icons
for the hidden tools, as shown in Figure 12-2. You can switch from one
tool to another by clicking those icons instead of opening the flyout
menu.
 When working with the Marquee tools, any of the Lasso tools, or the
Magic Wand, be sure that the New Selection icon, labeled in Figure 12-2,
is active. (This is the default setting.) The other icons enable you to
modify an existing outline, as explained later in this chapter.
Selecting rectangular and oval areas
In most programs, you get at least one tool for drawing rectangular outlines
and another for drawing oval outlines. Elements names these tools the
Rectangular Marquee and the Elliptical Marquee; the two tools share a flyout
menu (refer to Figure 12-2).
Whatever the tool name, create your selection outline by dragging from one
side of the area you want to select to the other, as shown in Figure 12-3.
(You won’t see the direction arrow; I added that for illustration purposes.)
Figure 12-3: To select an area with either Marquee tool, drag from one corner to another.
271
Chapter 12: Cut, Paste, and Cover Up

272
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
You can adjust the performance of the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee
tools via the options bar, as follows:
 Feather: If you feather the outline,
whatever edit you apply fades gradu-
ally from the edges of the selected
area. For example, in Figure 12-4, I
selected the background and filled it
with white to create a framing effect
(upcoming steps spell out the tech-
nique). For the top image, I set the
Feather value to 0. This created the
selection with no feathering, which
resulted in a crisp edge to the frame.
For the lower example, I set the value
to 20 to produce a soft, vignette effect.
You need to experiment to see what
value is appropriate for your project.
 Anti-aliased: This option, available for
the Elliptical Marquee only, smooths
jagged edges that can occur when
your selection outline contains curved
or diagonal lines. For retouching pur-
poses and for framing effects, this
option is usually a good idea. When
you’re selecting a subject in order to
copy and paste it into another photo,
though, experiment with turning the
option off. 
 Style: Choose Normal for full control
over the shape and size of the selec-
tion outline. Fixed Aspect Ratio and
Fixed Size limit the tool to drawing an
outline with specific proportions or
dimensions, respectively. Chapter 11
explains how to use the Fixed Aspect
Ratio option to crop a photo to standard frame sizes.

To get a feel for the Marquee tools, follow these steps to produce a framing
effect like the ones in Figure 12-4:
1. Select the Rectangular Marquee for a rectangular frame; select the
Elliptical Marquee for a round frame. 
On the options bar, set the Mode control to Normal. When using the
Elliptical Marquee, turn on the Anti-aliased check box. Also be sure that
the New Selection icon, labeled in Figure 12-2, is selected. Set the Feather
value as desired; remember, a value of 0 produces a crisp frame edge.
2. Drag to enclose the area you want to keep in a selection outline.
3. Choose Select➪Inverse.
This command reverses the selection outline. Now the background is
selected instead of the area you initially enclosed in the outline.
4. Press D to set the background paint color to white.
5. Press the Delete key.
The background is filled with white. (If you want the frame to be some
other color, just set the background color to that color before you press
Delete. The next chapter shows you how.) Press Ctrl+D (Windows) or
Ô+D (Mac) to get rid of the selection outline; then crop away the excess
background as needed, following the instructions in Chapter 11.
If you forget to enter a Feather value before you draw your outline, you can add
feathering after the fact. Just choose Select➪Feather to display the Feather
Selection dialog box, enter a feathering value, and click OK. You must add the
feathering before you apply your actual change to the selected pixels, however.
In the framing project, for example, you must choose the Feather command
before you take Step 5.
Selecting by color
One of my favorite selection weapons ropes off pixels based on color. Elements
calls its color-based selection tool the Magic Wand, while other programs call
it the Color Wand, Color Selector, or something similar.
Whatever the name, the tool works pretty much the same everywhere you
find it. You click on your picture, and the program automatically selects
pixels that are the same color as the one you clicked.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
When you activate the Elements Magic Wand, the options bar offers the con-
trols shown in Figure 12-5. If your software offers a color-selecting tool, you
likely have access to similar options. They work as follows:
 Tolerance: This setting determines how closely a pixel must match the
color of the one you click in order to be selected. At a low value, the tool
selects only pixels that are very close in color. Raise the value to select a
broader range of similar shades.
Figure 12-6 illustrates the results of using four different Tolerance values.
The little x in each rose indicates the position of the Magic Wand when I
clicked; the yellowish tint indicates the regions included in the resulting
selection. (I added the tint for the illustration; in reality, you see only a
selection outline after you click.) You can enter a Tolerance value as high
as 255, but anything above 100 or so tends to make the Magic Wand too
casual in its pixel roundup. And a value of 255 selects the entire image,
which you can do more easily by simply choosing Select➪All.
 Anti-aliased: This one works just as described in the preceding section,
so I won’t go over it again here.
 Contiguous: Use this option to limit the tool to selecting only similarly
colored pixels that are contiguous to the one you click. In plain English,
that means that similarly colored pixels are not selected if any pixels of
another color lie between them and the pixel you click.
Figure 12-5: The Magic Wand selects pixels based on color.

Figure 12-6: Raise the Tolerance value to select a broader range of colors.
For example, in Figure 12-7, I clicked the dark background area at the
position marked by the x. With the Contiguous option turned on, the
tool selected the area shown in the middle image. Matching areas in the
lower-right corner aren’t selected because areas of pink and gray lie
between those matching pixels and the one I clicked. In the right exam-
ple, however, I turned off the Contiguous option, so Elements selected
matching pixels regardless of their location in the image. Once again, I
filled the selection with a yellow tint to make the extent of the selection
easier to see.
 Use All Layers: If your picture contains multiple layers, a feature
explained in Chapter 13, select this check box if you want the Magic
Wand to “see” pixels on all layers when creating the selection outline.
Remember, though, that the outline that you create affects only the
active layer — the program just takes all layers into account when 
drawing the selection outline.

Figure 12-7: With the Contiguous option turned off, the Magic Wand selects matching pixels throughout the
image.
Before clicking with the Magic Wand, make sure that the New Selection icon
is active (refer to Figure 12-5).
Finding the right combination of Tolerance value and Contiguous setting
takes some experimenting. If the first click doesn’t produce the results you
want, change the settings and simply click again to generate a new selection
outline. Or use the techniques outlined in the upcoming section “Refining
your selection outline” to add or subtract pixels from the selection.
Drawing freehand selections
Another popular type of selection tool enables you to select irregular areas of
an image simply by tracing around them with your mouse. Well, I say “simply,”
but frankly, you need a pretty steady hand to draw precise selection outlines.
Some people can do it; I can’t. So I normally use these tools to select a general
area of the image and then use other tools to select the exact pixels I want to
edit. (Building selection outlines in this way is discussed in the upcoming
section “Refining your selection outline.”)
At any rate, this tool goes by different names depending on the software —
Freehand tool, Lasso tool, and Trace tool are among the popular labels.
Elements opts for Lasso, as does Photoshop. Both programs offer two varia-
tions on the Lasso, the Polygonal Lasso and the Magnetic Lasso. The three
Lassos share a slot in the toolbox; again, you can switch from one tool to
another by clicking the options bar icons.
To use the Elements Lasso and Polygonal Lasso, first make sure that the
New Selection icon is active, as shown in Figure 12-8. Set the Anti-aliased
and Feather value as desired (refer to the earlier discussion of the Marquee
tools to find out about these options). Then rope off those pixels as follows:
 Lasso: Just drag around the object you want to select. When you reach
the point where you began dragging, release the mouse button to close
the selection outline.
Contiguous On
Contiguous Off

 Polygonal Lasso: This tool assists you with drawing straight segments in
a freeform outline. Click to set the start of the first line, move the mouse
to the spot where you want to end the segment, and then click to set the
end point, as illustrated in Figure 12-8. Keep clicking and moving the
mouse to draw more line segments. When you get back to the starting
point of the outline, release the mouse button to close the outline.
When working with either tool, you can temporarily switch to the other
one by pressing and holding the Alt key on a PC or the Option key on a
Mac. Let up on the Alt (Option) key to return to the original tool you
were using.
The next section explains the third tool in the Elements Lasso trio, the
Magnetic Lasso.

Selecting by the edges
If you read Chapter 11, you know that the term edges refers to areas where
very light areas meet very dark areas. Many photo-editing programs, includ-
ing Elements, provide a selection tool that simplifies the task of drawing a
selection outline along an edge.
As you drag with this tool, called the Magnetic Lasso in Elements, the tool
searches for edges and lays down the selection outline along those edges.
Figure 12-9 shows me using this tool to create a selection outline around the
Kodak Baby Brownie camera.
The process of using an edge-detection tool typically works like so:
1. Click at the point where you want the selection outline to begin.
Figure 12-9: The Magnetic Lasso automatically places a selection outline along the border between
contrasting areas.
Fastening point
Magnetic Lasso

2. Move or drag your mouse along the border of the object you’re trying
to select.
Keep your tool cursor centered over the border, as shown in Figure 12-9.
Whether you need to simply move the mouse or drag, with the mouse
button depressed, depends on your software. In Elements, you can do
either.
As you move or drag the mouse, the tool automatically draws the selection
outline along the border between the object and the background —
assuming that at least some contrast exists between the two. At regular
intervals, the program adds little squares to anchor the outline. You can
see these squares, called fastening points in Elements, in Figure 12-9.
You can click to create your own fastening points if needed. To remove a
fastening point, move the mouse cursor over the point and press Delete.
3. To finish the outline, place your cursor over the first point in the out-
line and click.
As with color-based selection tools, you can usually control the sensitivity of
edge-detection tools. In Elements, use the following options bar controls to
adjust this and other aspects of the Magnetic Lasso’s performance: 
 Feather, Anti-aliased: These controls affect your selection outline as
described in the earlier section, “Selecting rectangular and oval areas.”
 Width: This control determines how far the tool can wander in its search
for edges. Larger values tell the tool to go farther afield; smaller values
keep the tool closer to home. You can enter any value from 1 to 256.
 Edge Contrast: Adjust this value to make the tool more or less sensitive
to contrast changes. Use a low value if not much contrast exists between
the object you want to select and the neighboring area. The maximum
value is 100.
 Frequency: This setting affects how often the program adds fastening
points. The default value usually works fine. Adding too many points can
lead to a jaggedy outline, so try to go lower, if anything. Remember that
you can always click to add your own fastening points, if needed.
 Pen Pressure: At the far right end of the options bar (not shown in
Figure 12-9), the Pen Pressure control enables you to reduce the Width
value on the fly when you’re working with a drawing tablet and stylus.
Press harder on the stylus to decrease the Width value. At normal pres-
sure, the tool uses the Width value that you originally set on the options
bar. I find it difficult to predict how much pressure will produce the Width
value I want, so I don’t recommend this feature.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Brushing on a selection outline
For complex selection outlines that don’t lend themselves to the Magic
Wand’s color-based nature, the best option is a tool like the Elements
Selection Brush. With this tool, you paint over the areas you don’t want to
alter, laying down a digital mask over those pixels. Think of that liquid mask
solution you can paint on window glass before painting the sash, and you get
the idea. Selecting this way is much easier than drawing freeform outlines
with any of the Lasso or Marquee tools.
The following steps show you how to use the tool in Elements. Depending on
your program, you may have access to additional tool options; Photoshop,
for example, offers a Quick Mask feature that is like the Selection Brush on
steroids.
1. Grab the Selection Brush tool, labeled in Figure 12-10.
2. On the options bar, set the Mode control to Mask.
3. Display the Brushes palette by clicking the arrow labeled in
Figure 12-10.
The icons in your palette may look different if you have changed the
default display. To change the palette appearance, open the palette
menu by clicking the arrow labeled in the figure.
Figure 12-10: With the Selection Brush, you paint a mask over the areas that you don’t want to select.

Click to open palette menu

4. Choose any of the round brushes from the first row of the palette.
For now, leave the Hardness value at 100 percent. Use the Size control to
adjust brush size as needed.
5. Drag over the areas you want to mask.
The pixels you touch are covered by a red, translucent overlay, as shown
in Figure 12-10. If the overlay makes it difficult for you to see the picture,
use the Overlay Opacity and Overlay Color controls on the options bar
to adjust the tint.
If you mess up and paint over areas that you don’t want to mask, press
and hold the Alt key (Windows) or Option key (Mac) while you drag over
those areas. Now the tool removes the mask.
6. After you apply the mask to all the areas you don’t want to alter, set
the Mode control to Selection.
A selection outline appears around all the pixels that were not covered
by the mask.
Now that you have the basic idea, you can refine the way the Selection Brush
works by adjusting the Hardness control on the options bar. At a value of
100 percent, your brush has precise edges, giving you the same final result
as a nonfeathered selection outline. To soften the brush edge and create a
feathered outline, lower the Hardness value. See the earlier section “Selecting
rectangular or oval outlines” for information on feathering.
Selecting (and deselecting) everything
Want to make a change to your entire photo? Don’t monkey around with the
selection tools described in the preceding sections. Most programs provide
a command or tool that automatically selects all pixels in your picture.
281
Chapter 12: Cut, Paste, and Cover Up
Building a better mouse cursor
Initially, Elements brush cursors have an icon-
based look — the cursor for the Selection Brush
looks like a little paintbrush, for example. The
paintbrush remains the same size and shape, no
matter what brush settings you use when work-
ing with the tool, which makes it difficult to tell
where your next swipe will go. For an easier
way to work, you can tell Elements to instead
display a cursor that reflects the current brush
size and shape, as you see in Figure 12-10. To
make this change in Windows, choose Edit➪
Preferences➪Display & Cursors and then set the
Painting Cursors option to Brush Size. On a Mac,
you access the setting by choosing Photoshop
Elements➪Preferences➪Display & Cursors.

282
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
In some entry-level photo editors, you simply click the image with a particu-
lar selection tool, usually called a Pick tool or Arrow tool. Click once to select;
click again to deselect.
Other programs provide menu commands for selecting and deselecting:
 Look on the menu that holds the selection commands for a Select All
command or something similar. You can probably also find a Select None
or Deselect command that gets rid of an existing selection outline.
In Elements, choose Select➪All and Select➪Deselect. To get your last
selection outline back, choose Select➪Reselect.
 For the quickest route to whole-image selection, use the universal key-
board shortcut: Ctrl+A in Windows and Ô+A on a Mac.
 Some programs also provide a shortcut for deselecting everything. In
Elements, press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Ô+D (Mac).
 In most programs, starting a new selection outline also gets rid of the
existing outline. If you instead want to adjust the outline, see the next
section.
Note that if your photograph includes multiple image layers, your selection
outline affects only the current layer even when you use the command to
select everything. If you want to make a change to all layers, you must merge
the layers into one or apply the same change to each layer individually.
Chapter 13 gives you the complete story on layers.
Reversing a selection outline
You can sometimes select an object more quickly if you first select the area
that you don’t want to edit and then invert the selection. Inverting simply
reverses the selection outline so that the pixels that are currently selected
become deselected, and vice versa.
Consider the left image in Figure 12-11. Suppose that you wanted to select
everything but the sky. Drawing a selection outline around all the spires and
ornate trimmings of the church spire, flagpole, and street lamp would take
forever. But with a few swift clicks of the Magic Wand, I was able to select the
sky and then invert the selection to select the buildings. In the right image,
I deleted the selected area to illustrate how cleanly this technique selected
the buildings.

Figure 12-11: To select these ornate structures (left), I used the Magic Wand to select the sky
and then inverted the selection outline. Deleting the selected pixels (right) shows how precisely
this technique selected even the intricate architectural elements.
To reverse a selection outline in Elements, choose Select➪Inverse. In other
photo-editing programs, look for an Invert or Inverse command. The com-
mand typically hangs out in the same menu or palette that contains your
other selection tools. But be careful — some programs (including Elements)
use the name Invert for a filter that inverts the colors in your image, creating
a photographic negative effect. If you find Invert or Inverse on a menu that
contains special effects or color adjustments, the command probably applies
the negative effect instead of inverting the selection.
Refining your selection outline
In theory, creating selection outlines sounds like a simple thing. In reality, 
getting a selection outline just right on the first try is about as rare as
Republicans and Democrats agreeing on who should pay fewer taxes and
who should pony up more. In other words, you should expect to refine your
selection outline at least a little bit after you make your initial attempt.
283
Chapter 12: Cut, Paste, and Cover Up

284
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
All advanced photo-editing programs and some consumer-level programs
enable you to adjust your selection outline. The preceding section explains
one way to alter an outline — reversing it using the Invert command. You also
can enlarge or reduce a selection outline using these techniques: 
 Add to a selection outline: To enlarge the selection outline, set the
selection tool to an additive mode. You can then draw a new outline
while retaining the existing one.
 Shrink a selection outline: To deselect certain pixels currently enclosed
in a selection outline, you set the selection tool to a subtractive mode.
The tool then works in reverse, deselecting instead of selecting.
 Intersect a selection outline: Some programs go even further, enabling
you to create a selection outline that encompasses the area of overlap
between an existing outline and a second outline. For example, if you
draw a rectangular outline and then draw a second outline that overlaps
the right half of the first outline, only pixels inside the area of overlap
become selected. In other words, the “intersection” of the two outlines
becomes selected.
Methods for switching selection tools from their normal operating mode to
the additive, subtractive, or intersection mode vary widely from program to
program. In some programs, you click a toolbar icon; in other programs, you
press a key to toggle the additive and subtractive modes on and off. 
In Elements, you can refine selection outlines
as follows:
 Adjusting outlines by using the
Marquees, Lassos, or Magic Wand: To
add to the outline, press and hold the
Shift key as you drag or click. To set the
tool to subtractive mode, press and hold
the Alt key (Windows) or Option key (Mac)
instead. Alternatively, use the tool-mode
buttons on the options bar. Figure 12-12
gives you a close-up look at the buttons.
 Adjusting outlines by using the Selection Brush: If you prefer to work
with the Selection Brush, just change the Mode control on the options
bar back to Mask. Then you can paint the mask on and off as described
earlier. Switch the Mode control to Selection when you finish.
 Moving a selection outline: Using any selection tool except the
Selection Brush, drag inside the outline. Or press the arrow keys on your
keyboard to nudge the outline one pixel in the direction of the arrow.
 Expanding or contracting an outline by a specific number of pixels:
Choose Select➪Modify➪Expand or Select➪Modify➪Contract and enter
a value (in pixels) in the resulting dialog box. 
Figure 12-12: To set the selection
tool mode in Elements, you can
use these options bar buttons.

Selection Moves, Copies, and Pastes
After you select a portion of your image, you can do all sorts of things to the
selected pixels. You can paint them without fear of dripping color on any 
unselected pixels, for example. You can apply special effects or apply color-
correction commands just to the selected area, leaving reality undistorted in
the rest of your image.
Another common reason for creating a selection outline is to move or copy the
selected pixels within the image or to another image, as I did in Figure 12-13.
I took three coins from the money photo and put them into the wood image,
proving once and for all to my parents that money does too grow on trees.
I copied and pasted each coin separately so that I could rearrange them in
their new home, a topic discussed later in this chapter.
Figure 12-13: After selecting and copying the coins, I pasted them into the wood image.

Chapter 12: Cut, Paste, and Cover Up

286
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
The following sections give you all the information you need to become an
expert at moving, copying, and pasting selected portions of a photo.
You can also copy pixels using a special editing tool known as the Clone tool.
This specialized tool enables you to “paint” a portion of your image onto
another portion of your image, as discussed later in this chapter in “Pasting
Good Pixels Over Bad.”
Cut, Copy, Paste: The old reliables
You can move and copy selections using the time-honored computer com-
mands Cut, Copy, and Paste. These commands are available in most every
photo editor; usually, you find them on the Edit menu.
Before I get any further into this discussion, though, one caveat: When you
paste a portion of one photo into another in many programs, including
Elements, the pasted element may appear to change size. This happens if the
output resolution (ppi) for both photos isn’t the same. The number of pixels in
the pasted element doesn’t change, just the number of pixels per inch, which
affects the print dimensions. If you want your copied selection to retain its
original size when placed in the other image, be sure that the output resolu-
tion is the same for both pictures. (See Chapters 2, 9, and 10 for further details
on resizing and resolution.)
With that bit of business out of the way, here’s the Cut/Copy/Paste routine in
a nutshell:
 Copy duplicates the selected
pixels and places the copy on the
Clipboard, a temporary virtual
storage tank. Your original image
is left intact.
 Cut snips the pixels out of your
image and places them on the
Clipboard. You’re left with a hole
where the pixels used to be, as
illustrated in Figure 12-14. In
Elements, the hole takes on the
current background paint color —
white, in the figure. The next 
chapter tells you how to change
the paint color.
 Paste glues the contents of the
Clipboard into your image.
Figure 12-14: Applying the Cut command to a
selection creates a background-colored hole.

After you dump the contents of the Clipboard into your photo, you may
need to adjust the position of the pasted element slightly. The next section
explains how.
Adjusting a pasted object
Different programs treat pasted pixels in different fashions. In some programs,
the Paste command works like super-strong epoxy — you can’t move the
pasted selection without ripping a hole in the image, just as when you cut a
selection. In other programs, your pasted pixels behave more like they’re on
a sticky note. You can “lift” them up and move them around without affecting
the underlying image.
Elements takes the second approach to pasting, as does Photoshop. Both
programs place your pixels on a new layer. Layers are explained more fully
in Chapter 13, but for now, just understand the following facts:
 To see all the layers in your
photo, including the one con-
taining the newly pasted pixels,
choose Window➪Layers to dis-
play the Layers palette. By
default, the palette appears in
the Palette Bin on the right side
of the program window; if you
prefer, you can drag it by its top
into the main workspace. The
now free-floating palette appears
as shown in Figure 12-15, and
you can close the Palette Bin
(Window➪Palette Bin).
 By default, transparent areas in
a layer appear as a checker-
board pattern in the thumbnail
previews in the Layers palette,
as shown in the figure. Pixels
on the layer below show
through the transparent areas.
In Figure 12-13, for example, the
wood background is visible through the empty areas of the coin layers.
 To retain the individual image layers when you save your picture, save
in the program’s native format, PSD, or TIFF. Other formats merge the
layers, which means that you can no longer manipulate the pasted ele-
ment independently of the rest of the photo. Inside the Save As dialog box
(discussed in Chapter 11), be sure to select the Layers check box, too.
287
Chapter 12: Cut, Paste, and Cover Up
Figure 12-15: In Elements, each pasted selection
appears on its own layer.

288
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Because your pasted element exists on its own layer, you can adjust it as nec-
essary to fit its new home. In Elements, first click the name of the layer in the
Layers palette. This makes the layer active. With the pasted layer active, use
these techniques to alter its contents:
 Move a pasted object: Select the Move tool, labeled in Figure 12-16, and
turn off the Auto Select Layer box on the options bar (not shown in
figure). Then drag the element in the image window. While the Move tool
is active, you also can press the arrow keys on your keyboard to nudge
the element a distance of one pixel. Press Shift plus an arrow key to
nudge the element ten pixels.
 Rotate a pasted element: Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform or
press Ctrl+T (Ô+T on a Mac). A square bounding box appears around the
layer contents, as shown in Figure 12-16. Little boxes — called handles —
appear around the perimeter of the boundary. Don’t see any handles?
Enlarge the image window to reveal them.
Move your mouse outside a corner handle to display the curved rotate
cursor, as shown in the figure. Then drag up or down to spin the layer. Click
the Commit button, labeled in the figure, to finalize the rotation. To cancel
out of a transformation, press the Esc key or click the Cancel button.
Figure 12-16: Drag outside a corner transformation handle to rotate the contents of a layer.

 Resize a pasted element: You can resize a pasted object by dragging the
transformation handles, but keep in mind that doing so can lead to poor
image quality. (See Chapter 2 for information about why resizing digital
photos can reduce picture quality.) 
To avoid distorting the element as you resize, be sure that the Maintain
Aspect Ratio button on the options bar is pressed in, as shown in Figure
12-16. Again, click the Commit button to complete the resizing.
 Flip the pasted element: Choose Image➪Rotate➪Flip Layer Horizontal
or Image➪Rotate➪Flip Layer Vertical. (The other flip commands flip the
entire photo.)
Deleting Selected Areas
You can use the Cut command to move a selected object from your current
photo to the Clipboard, where it stays until you cut or copy something else.
But don’t go to that trouble if all you want to do is simply remove a selected
something from your picture — just press the old Delete key.
Instead of traveling to the Clipboard, your selection goes to the great pixel
hunting ground in the sky. All that remains is a hole in the shape of the selec-
tion. If you’re working on a layer, you see the underlying layer through the
hole. For more on layers, see Chapter 13.
Pasting Good Pixels Over Bad
In addition to creating photo collages or rearranging elements in your pictures,
you can also copy and paste pixels for the purpose of covering up defects in
your photo. For example, in Figure 12-17, my shot of an Indianapolis landmark
is spoiled by lens flare. So I selected some nearby sky, copied it, and then
pasted it over the flaw. 
To perform this kind of photo surgery, you use the exact same techniques
outlined in the preceding sections. When covering large defects, you may
need to create several “patches,” copying and pasting selections from differ-
ent areas of the original image.
Another option for hiding defects is to pick up the Clone tool, provided in
most photo editors. With this tool, you can copy and paste pixels simply by
clicking or dragging. I went this route to eliminate the blown highlights in the
lemon in Figure 12-18. I simply cloned “good” lemon pixels over the defect.
The right side of the figure shows a close-up of the repaired area.
289
Chapter 12: Cut, Paste, and Cover Up

290
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 12-17: I hid the lens flare with sky pixels that I selected and copied from the surrounding area.
The Clone tool has no real-life counterpart, so you need to practice with the
tool for a bit to fully understand how it works. But I guarantee that after you
get acquainted with this tool, you’ll use it all the time.
Figure 12-18: To repair blown highlights, I cloned properly exposed pixels over the defect.

Depending on your program, the Clone tool may go by another name. In
Photoshop, for example, the tool used to be known as the Rubber Stamp,
which is why the tool cursor still looks like a rubber stamp in both Photoshop
and Elements. In recent versions of Photoshop, the tool name was changed to
Clone Stamp, which is the official name in Elements as well. For the sake of
brevity, I’m just going to call it the Clone tool.
Regardless of what you call it, you use the same basic approach to clone in
most programs:
1. First, activate your Clone tool.
In Elements, click the tool icon in the toolbox, labeled in Figure 12-19.
(Be careful not to grab the Pattern Stamp tool instead, which shares a
flyout menu with the Clone tool.)
2. Establish the clone source.
The clone source refers to the area of your picture that you want to
clone — the source of the cloned pixels, in other words. This step sets
the initial clone source. The process for setting the clone source varies
from program to program.
Figure 12-19: As you drag with the Clone tool, the source cursor follows in tandem, showing you what pixels
are currently being copied.

In Elements, Alt+click (Windows) or Option+click (Mac) to set the clone
source. When you press the Alt or Option key, your cursor temporarily
changes to a little target cursor. In Figure 12-19, the red X indicates the
position of my initial clone source.
3. Click on or drag over the flaw that you want to cover.
The program copies pixels from the clone source onto the pixels under-
neath your tool cursor.
If you drag to clone, the position of the clone source moves in tandem
with the tool cursor. For example, if you drag down and to the left, you
clone pixels that fall below and to the left of the initial clone source.
In Elements, a clone source cursor appears when you begin to clone.
(I labeled this cursor in Figure 12-19.) You can look at the clone source
cursor to see which pixels the program is about to clone. In Figure 12-19,
the black X indicates the spot where I began dragging with the tool; the
arrows show you the path that the tool cursor and clone source cursor
took as I dragged.
Note that as explained earlier in the “Building a better mouse cursor” sidebar,
I’ve set the Painting Cursors option to Brush Size inside the Preferences
dialog box so that my tool cursor reflects the size and shape of the tool
brush. (The setting applies to any tool that has a brush-based tip, not just
tools that apply paint.)
You can adjust the performance of the Elements Clone tool by using the
options bar controls shown in the figure. The following list describes these
options, which are similar to those provided for Clone tools in other advanced
photo-editing programs:
 Brush: You can specify the size, shape, and softness of the tool brush by
using the Brush controls. When cloning in areas of sharp focus, a hard
brush usually works best; in soft-focus areas, choose a soft brush. The
size of your brush determines how many pixels will be cloned onto the
flawed pixels with each click or drag.
 Mode: This option controls how the cloned pixels blend with the original
pixels. In Normal mode, the cloned pixels completely obscure the under-
lying pixels, which is usually the goal when you’re doing touch-up work.
You can create a variety of different effects by playing with the other
blending modes. (Chapter 13 touches on blending modes a little more.)
 Opacity: You can vary the opacity of the pixels you clone by using this
control. I often use 60 or 70 percent opacity when using the Clone tool
to blend cloned pixels with the original more naturally. But if you want
your cloned pixels to completely cover the original pixels, set the value
to 100 percent.

 Aligned: This control determines whether the clone source reverts to its
original position — the spot you clicked to establish the clone source —
each time you click or begin a new drag with the tool. When the option
is turned off, the clone source cursor returns to the original position.
This setting enables you to clone the same pixels repeatedly. 
If you turn the Aligned check box on, the clone source cursor stays put
after you click or end your drag, however. So on your next click or drag,
you just continue cloning from where you left off. If you do want to
clone from the same source again, you must reset the clone source
(by Alt+clicking or Option+clicking).
 Use All Layers: If you’re working on a photo that has multiple image
layers, a feature described in Chapter 13, select this check box if you
want the Clone tool to be able to “see” pixels on all layers. When the
check box is turned off, the tool can clone only pixels on the active layer.
So if you’re working on Layer 2, for example, you can’t clone pixels from
Layer 1.
Enlarging the Image Canvas
When you cut and paste pictures together, you may need to increase the size
of the image canvas. The canvas is nothing more than a virtual backdrop that
holds all the pixels in your image — think of it like a blank document in a
word processing program, if that helps.
Suppose that you have two images that you want to place side by side.
Perhaps image A is a picture of your boss, and image B is a picture of the
boss’s boss. You open image A, increase the canvas area along one side of
the image, and then copy and paste image B into the empty canvas area.
How you adjust the canvas varies from program to program. Look for informa-
tion about canvas size, image background, or picture size in your software’s
Help system. Just make sure that you’re changing the dimensions of the
canvas and not the image itself. (See Chapter 2 for more information on
changing image size.)
To adjust the canvas size in Elements, choose Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size to
open the Canvas Size dialog box, shown in Figure 12-20. Enter the new canvas
dimensions into the Width and Height option boxes. Next, use the Anchor
grid at the bottom of the dialog box to specify where you want to position the
existing image on the new canvas. For example, if you want the extra canvas
area to be added equally around the entire image, click in the center square.
You can specify the color of the new canvas area using the drop-down list at
the bottom of the dialog box.
293
Chapter 12: Cut, Paste, and Cover Up

294
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 12-20: To enlarge the picture canvas in Elements, head for this 
dialog box.
To trim away excess canvas, reduce the Width and Height values. Again, click
in the grid to specify where you want the image to be located with respect to
the new canvas. Note that you can also use the Crop tool to cut away excess
canvas; see Chapter 11 for information. But using the Canvas Size command
is a better option if you want to trim the canvas by a precise amount — a
quarter-inch on all four sides, for example.
As an alternative way of adjusting the canvas, you can select the Relative
check box. Then enter the amount of canvas that you want to add or trim in
the Width and Height boxes. For example, to add an inch to all four sides of
the canvas, set the Width and Height values to 2 inches and then click the
center anchor square. To instead cut an inch off all four sides, set both values
to –2. (You must enter the minus sign.)

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Giving Your Image a Paint Job
Remember when you were in kindergarten and the teacher announced that it
was time for finger painting? In a world that normally admonished you to be
neat and clean, someone actually encouraged you to drag your hands through
wet paint and make a colorful mess of yourself.
Photo-editing programs bring back the bliss of youth by enabling you to paint
on your digital photographs. The process isn’t nearly as messy as those
childhood finger-painting sessions, but it’s every bit as entertaining.
To paint in a photo editor, you can use your mouse or whatever pointing
device you prefer to create strokes that mimic those produced by traditional
art tools, such as a paintbrush, pencil, or airbrush. Or you can dump color
over a large area by selecting the area and then choosing the Fill command,
which paints all selected pixels in one step.
Why would you want to paint on your photographs? Here are a few reasons:
 Change the color of an object in your photo. Say that you shoot a pic-
ture of a green leaf to use as artwork on your Web site. You decide that
you’d also like to have a red leaf and a yellow leaf, but you don’t have
time to wait for autumn to roll around so that you can photograph fall-
colored leaves. You can make two copies of the green leaf and then paint
one red and the other yellow.
 Hide minor flaws. Is a small blown highlight ruining an otherwise good
photo? Does red-eye spoil a family portrait? Pick up a paint tool and dab
over the problem pixels.
 Express your creativity. If you enjoy painting or drawing with traditional
art tools, you’ll be blown away by the possibilities presented by digital
painting tools. You can blend photography and hand-painted artwork to
create awesome images.
To get an idea of the possibilities, take a look at Figure 13-1, which shows
me in the process of creating a “chalk” drawing based on a photo, using the
program Corel Painter IX. For users who have limited drawing experience,
Painter offers a feature that assists you with this process. As you draw,
the program renders the photo using the style and texture of your chosen
media. The cool thing is that you can vary how much detail is reproduced
by adjusting tool settings — a level of control not offered by the artistic-
effects filters found in most photo-editing programs. In this photo, for
example, I chose to do a soft wash behind the subject rather than faith-
fully reproducing the distracting background elements. Mind you, I’m an
absolute novice at drawing; think of what you could do with some real skill.
 Make friends and family look silly. Okay, you’ve probably already dis-
covered this one on your own. Admit it, now — the first thing you tried
in your photo software was painting a mustache or devil horns on some-
one’s picture, wasn’t it? 

Figure 13-1: I turned my photo into a chalk drawing with the help of Corel Painter.
What’s in your paint box?
Different photo editors offer differ-
ent assortments of painting tools.
Programs such as Corel Painter,
which are geared toward photo
artistry and digital painting, provide
an incredible supply of paint tools
and effects. You can paint with tools
that mimic the look of traditional
media or lay down special-effects
strokes, as shown in Figure 13-2.
If you’re skilled at drawing or paint-
ing, you can express endless creative
notions using this kind of program.
You may also want to invest in a
drawing tablet, which enables you to
paint with a pen-like stylus, which
most people find easier than using a
297
Chapter 13: Amazing Stuff Even You Can Do

marketed toward photo artisans enable you to
create a broad range of brush stroke effects.

298
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
mouse. (Be sure that the software you choose supports this function if you
take the leap.) See Chapter 4 for a look at a drawing tablet.
Keep in mind that programs that emphasize painting tools sometimes don’t
offer as many image-correction or retouching options as programs such as
Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, which concentrate on those
functions rather than painting. On the other hand, programs that focus on
retouching and correction usually don’t offer a wide range of painting tools.
Elements, for example, provides just a couple of painting tools.
Still, you can accomplish quite a bit even with a few basic painting tools. To
introduce you to the possibilities, upcoming sections show you how to use
paint to perform one common retouching task and one creative project:
removing red-eye and changing the color of a photo element. 
You can accomplish either job using just the Elements Brush or Pencil tool,
both found near the bottom of the toolbox. The Pencil produces clean, crisp
strokes like the top line in Figure 13-3; the Brush tool can paint soft-edged or
hard-edged strokes, as shown in the lower two lines. Most photo-editing pro-
grams provide similar tools.
Figure 13-3: Just drag with the Pencil or Brush tool to lay down a swath of color.
Pencil
Brush
Paint color controls

With either tool, laying down paint is simple. Just click to dab on one
cursor’s-worth of color, or drag to create a longer stroke.
To paint a perfect horizontal or vertical stroke in Elements, press Shift as you
drag. To paint a straight line at any other angle, click to set the start of the
line and then Shift-click at the spot where you want the line to end.
Setting the paint color
Before you lay down a coat of paint, you need to choose the paint color. In
most photo editors, two paint cans are available at any one time:
 Foreground color: Usually, the major painting tools apply the fore-
ground color. In Elements, that includes the Brush and Pencil.
 Background color: The background color typically comes into play
when you use certain special-effects filters that involve two colors.
But in Elements, the Eraser tool also applies the background color if
you’re working on the background layer of the photo. (“Uncovering Layers
of Possibility,” later in this chapter, provides details.) In addition, when
you delete a selected area on the background layer, the resulting hole is
filled with the background color. See Chapter 12 for more on that topic.
Like many other aspects of photo editing, the process of choosing the fore-
ground and background colors is similar no matter what program you’re using.
Some programs provide a special color palette in which you click the color
you want to use. Some programs rely on the Windows or Macintosh system
color pickers, while other programs, including Elements, provide you with a
choice between the program color picker and the system color picker.
The next three sections explain how to use the Elements color picker, the
Windows system color picker, and the Macintosh color picker.
Choosing colors in Photoshop Elements
In Elements, the bottom section of the
toolbox contains four important color con-
trols, labeled in Figure 13-4. The controls
work as follows:
 The two large color swatches show
you the current foreground and back-
ground paint colors.
 Click the Default Colors icon to re-
establish the default foreground and
background colors, which are black
and white, respectively.
 Click the Swap Colors icon to make
the foreground color the background color, and vice versa.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Elements provides several ways to change the foreground or background color
to something other than black or white. The two simplest methods are: 
 Eyedropper: Grab the Eye-
dropper, labeled in Figure 13-5,
and click a pixel in the image
to lift a color from your picture
and make it the foreground
color. Using this technique,
you can easily match the paint
color to a color in your photo.
To set the background color
using the Eyedropper, Alt+click
(Windows) or Option+click
(Mac).
When the Sample Size control
on the options bar is set to
Point Sample, the tool exactly
matches the pixel that you
click. To blend a color that’s
a mix of several adjacent
pixels, set the control to 3 by
3 Average or 5 by 5 Average.
 Color Picker: Click the fore-
ground or background color swatch in the toolbox, depending on which
color you want to change. By default, the program then displays the
Color Picker dialog box shown in Figure 13-6. If you get your operating
system (Windows or Apple) color picker instead, close the dialog box
and then head for the Elements Preferences dialog box. In Windows,
choose Edit➪Preferences➪General. On a Mac, choose Photoshop
Elements➪Preferences➪General. Set the Color Picker option to Adobe
and then click OK. 
Inside the Color Picker, you can select colors using the HSB color model
or the RGB color model, both explained in Chapter 2. For most people,
the HSB model is most intuitive. Click the H button to set up the dialog
box as shown in Figure 13-6. Drag the color slider to set the hue and click
in the color field to adjust the saturation and brightness. The New Color
swatch shows you the color that you’re making. When the color is just
right, click OK or press Enter to close the dialog box.
If you know the exact RGB or HSB values for the color you want to use,
you can just enter them into the corresponding boxes instead of using
the color field and slider.
As with other Elements information given in this book, I’ve provided just the
basics of using the Color Picker. The dialog box offers additional features that
come in handy for Web designers, and I urge you to explore them if you’re in
that arena.
Figure 13-5: To change the foreground color to a
color in your photo, click that color with the
Eyedropper.

Figure 13-6: To blend a custom paint color, use the Elements Color Picker.
Choosing colors via the Windows color picker
In some Windows-based photo-editing programs, you choose paint colors
using the Windows Color dialog box. Figure 13-7 shows the Windows XP ver-
sion of that color picker.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Here’s the short course in picking a color from this dialog box:
 To choose one of the colors in the Basic Colors area, click its swatch.
 To access more colors, click the Define Custom Colors button, located
just above the OK button. Clicking the button displays the right half of
the dialog box, as shown in Figure 13-7. (The button is dimmed in the
figure because I already clicked it.)
 Drag the crosshair cursor in the color field to choose the hue and satu-
ration (intensity) of the color, and drag the Lightness slider to adjust the
amount of black and white in the color.
 The Color/Solid swatch displays two versions of your color — the left
side shows the color as you’ve defined it, and the right side shows the
nearest solid color. See, a monitor can display only so many solid colors.
The rest it creates by combining the available solid colors — a process
known as dithering. Dithered colors have a patterned look to them and
don’t look as sharp on-screen as solid colors.
How many solid colors are available to you depends on the settings of
your system’s video card. In past years, people using puny computer
systems sometimes set their video cards to display a mere 256 colors.
Unless you do the same, you won’t see any difference between the two
sides of the Color/Solid swatch. The feature is provided for Web designers
who want to be sure that even someone still using the 256-color display
limit sees only undithered colors on the Web page. If that describes you,
click the right side of the swatch to select the nearest solid color to the
one you mixed in the color field. (But realize that other colors in your
photo likely exceed the 256-color limit.)
After you choose your
color, click OK to leave
the dialog box.
Using the Apple 
color picker
If you’re working on a
Macintosh computer, your
photo software may enable
you — or require you —
to select colors using the
Apple color picker. The
Mac OS X version is shown
in Figure 13-8.
Click the Color Wheel icon
to set up the dialog box as
shown in the figure. Then
click inside the large color

by adjusting the hue, saturation, and lightness values.

wheel to choose the hue and saturation. Drag the neighboring slider to adjust
brightness. The bar at the top of the dialog box shows the color you’ve
mixed. When you’re satisfied, click OK.
Exploring Brush and Pencil options
When you work with the Elements Brush tool, the options bar provides a
number of controls for tweaking the tool performance. These options mimic
those found in many other programs, although the implementation and fea-
ture names may vary.
To activate Elements Brush tool, just press B. 
I explain what settings to use when providing steps for the projects covered
elsewhere in this book. For now, just scan through the following list of options
to get a general idea of what each one does:
 Brush size, shape, and hardness: I’ll assume that size and shape are
self-explanatory. Hardness refers to whether the stroke has crisp or
fuzzy edges. Figure 13-3, earlier in this chapter, shows both styles.
In Elements, you choose the brush shape from the Brushes palette,
shown in Figure 13-9. To open the palette, click the arrow labeled in
the figure. Then just click a brush icon. (The round brushes you see in
the figure are appropriate for most photographic projects.) The num-
bers underneath the icons indicate the initial brush size, in pixels. But
after clicking an icon, you can adjust the size via the Size control on the
options bar.
Initially, brushes are either fully hard or fully soft. (Blurry icons indicate
soft brushes.) For more control, open the More Options palette, shown
in the figure, and drag the Hardness slider. A value of 0 gives you the
softest brush. Don’t mess with the other settings until you’re an
advanced painter (if then).
 Blending mode: The blending mode feature enables you to mix
your painted strokes with the underlying pixels in different ways. 
Set the blending mode for the Brush tool via the Mode control on
the options bar.
For most photo projects, the two most useful blending modes are
Normal and Color. Use Normal when you want the painted pixels to
cover the original pixels completely. (You also must set the Opacity
value, explained next, to 100 percent.) The Color mode enables you
to change the color of an object realistically. The program applies the
new color to the pixels but retains the original highlights and shadows
in the painted area. The upcoming section about painting out red-eye
takes advantage of this mode.
303
Chapter 13: Amazing Stuff Even You Can Do

304
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 13-9: To set the brush shape and softness, open the Brushes palette.
 Paint opacity: You can make your
paint strokes fully opaque, so
that they completely obscure the
pixels you paint over, or reduce
the opacity so that some of the
underlying image shows through
the paint. In Figure 13-10, I defaced
the wood image by painting my
initials at four different opacity
settings. At an Opacity value of
100 percent, my digital graffiti is
fully opaque; at 25 percent, it’s
barely visible.
 Tablet options: If you work with a
drawing tablet, you may be able
to adjust some brush characteristics simply by varying the amount of
pressure on your stylus. Elements, for example, allows you to control five
different brush behaviors with stylus pressure. However, when you’re
first exploring photo editing, I suggest that you disable this feature. That

way, you don’t have to wonder whether your brush is acting a certain
way because of pen pressure or a particular brush setting. To turn off
the tablet features in Elements, open the Tablet Options palette and
uncheck all five boxes, as shown in Figure 13-11.
 Airbrush features: Your software may offer a stand-alone airbrush tool.
Or, like Elements, it may enable you to put your Brush tool in airbrush
mode. Either way, airbrushing applies paint differently than a regular
brush. The tool continues to pump out paint as long as you press the
mouse button (or stylus tip), even when you don’t move the cursor.
As with the aforementioned tablet options, I suggest that you pass up
airbrushing until you become well acquainted with how the standard
painting options affect your strokes. In Elements, just make sure that the
Airbrush icon is off, as shown in Figure 13-11.
Figure 13-11: While you’re getting acquainted with the Elements Brush tool, turn off the tablet options and the
Airbrush option.
Options for the Elements Pencil tool, shown in Figure 13-12, are more limited.
(Press N to select the tool quickly.) The size, shape, blending mode, and
opacity controls work just like those for the Brush tool. The Pencil tool has
no Hardness control because it can create only hard strokes. As for that Auto
Erase box, turn it off. When you turn this feature on, the Pencil automatically
switches to the background paint color whenever you paint over a pixel that
matches the foreground color. I’m sure this feature has a good use; I just
haven’t been able to think of one.
For greater painting flexibility, always paint on a new, independent image
layer. That way, you can further adjust painted strokes after you create them
by varying the opacity and blending mode of the layer itself. In addition, if you
decide you don’t like your painted pixels, you can get rid of them by simply
deleting the layer. Read the section “Uncovering Layers of Possibility,” later
in this chapter, for the full story on layers.

Figure 13-12: When working with the Pencil, turn off the Auto Erase box.
Also, the default Paint and Brush cursors look like the tool icons, which doesn’t
give you any idea of the chosen brush size or shape. For a better way to go,
visit the Preferences dialog box and change the Painting Cursors setting to
Brush Size. In Windows, open the dialog box by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪
Display & Cursors. On a Mac, choose Photoshop Elements➪Preferences➪
Display & Cursors.
Painting away red-eye
Even when you shoot flash portraits in red-eye reduction mode, you may
occasionally — wait, no, often — wind up with red-eye problems. The good
news is that this defect is easy to fix; you can simply paint in the new eye
color.
Many programs offer an automated red-eye removal tool, however. Some of
these tools work pretty well, and if they do, they’re quicker than painting over
the red pixels. So before you pick up the paint, give your red-eye tool a whirl.
In Elements, follow these steps:
1. Zoom in closely on the red-eye area.
Pencil

Click the image with the Zoom tool, labeled in Figure 13-13, to zoom in.
To zoom out, Alt-click with the tool in Windows or Option-click on a Mac.
2. Select the Red-Eye Removal tool, labeled in Figure 13-13.
Figure 13-13: The Elements Red-Eye Removal tool does a decent job on most eyes.
3. Drag to enclose the eyeball in a dotted outline, as shown in the figure.
4. Release the mouse button.
Elements replaces the red pixels with pixels that it thinks produces a
natural result. If you’re not happy with the outcome, choose Edit➪Undo,
play with the settings on the options bar, and try again.
Usually, if an automated red-eye tool is going to work, it does so on the first or
second try. After one or two attempts, don’t waste any more time. The results
likely won’t improve, and you can more quickly get the job done by simply
using your paint tool to cover up the red.
Note that the technique that I recommend involves the use of layers, which
are detailed later in this chapter. If you’re not yet familiar with layers, some of
this information may not make complete sense. Don’t panic — just click and
drag as instructed, and all will be well.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
With that bit of news out of the way, here are the red-eye cover-up steps in
Elements: 
1. Zoom in tightly on the red-eye area.
2. Pick up the Brush tool by clicking its toolbox icon or pressing B.
3. Set the brush size, shape, and hardness.
See the preceding section if you need help. For this job, you need a small,
round brush. Usually, a hard or medium-soft brush works best.
4. Set the other tool options as shown in Figure 13-14.
Specifically: Mode, Normal; Opacity, 100 percent; and Airbrush, off. If you
work with a pressure-sensitive tablet, open the Tablet Options menu and
turn off all check boxes therein.
5. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers palette.
Your palette may appear docked in the Palette Bin. If you want it to float
freely, as in Figure 13-14, just drag it by its title bar into the image
window. Then choose Window➪Palette Bin to close the bin.
6. Click the New Layer icon, labeled in Figure 13-14.
This step creates a new layer to hold your eye paint.
Figure 13-14: Paint in the new eye color on a separate layer, using the Color layer blending mode.

7. In the Layers palette, set the layer blending mode to Color, as shown
in Figure 13-14.
Similar to the painting tool blending modes described earlier, layer blend-
ing modes enable you to vary the way that the pixels on one layer mix
with the ones below. Color is the best choice for this task.
8. Set the foreground paint color to the new eye color.
A good trick: Press and hold the Alt key (Windows) or Option key (Mac),
which temporarily accesses the Eyedropper. Then click an eye pixel
that didn’t turn red. Your click establishes the foreground paint color.
Release the Alt or Option key to return to the Brush tool.
9. Click on or drag over the red pixels.
You may need to experiment with the paint color to find just the right
shade. If you spill paint outside the eye, use the Eraser, explained later
in this chapter, to rub it away.
10. When you’re happy with the eyes, choose Layer➪Merge Down.
This step fuses your paint layer with the underlying image.
This technique works for almost all cases of red-eye. But if the eyes are both
really red and really bright, you may not be able to get the pupil as dark as
it should be. The remedy is to add another new layer, this time setting the
blending mode to Normal and setting the Layers palette Opacity control to
50 percent. Now paint again with black, being careful not to paint over the
natural white highlights in the pupil. Tweak the effect by playing with the
Layers palette’s Opacity control. Again, merge the paint layer and underlying
layer when you finish.
Also, animal eyes typically turn white, yellow, or green instead of red in flash
pictures. You can use the preceding steps to fix your pet’s eyes, unless they
turned white. In that case, set the layer blending mode to Normal in Step 7.
Then reduce the Opacity value in the Layers palette slightly so that you retain
some of the original shadows and highlights of the eye when you paint.
Painting large areas
Dabbing out red-eye takes only a few clicks of your paint tool. But when you
want to paint a larger area, using your mouse or stylus can get tedious. If your
software offers a Fill command (or something like it), you have an easier
option. You can select the area and then pour paint into the entire selection.
I took this approach to paint four of the white petals in Figure 13-15. In all
three cases, I used the same salmon color you see on the petal labeled Normal.
So why did the other three petals turn out differently? Because the Fill com-
mand, like the Brush and Pencil tools, offers a choice of blending modes.
Again, blending mode simply refers to the way that paint pixels are mixed
with the original pixels.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 13-15: I filled each petal with the same color of paint, but using different blending modes.
As you can see, the Normal mode creates an entirely unnatural result because
a normal fill pours solid color throughout your selection, obliterating the
shadows and highlights of the original photograph. For a more realistic paint
job, I filled the top petal using the Color mode, which retains the shadows
and highlights of the underlying image.
Programs that provide blending modes tend to offer the same assortment of
modes. I could provide you with an in-depth description of how different blend
modes work, but frankly, predicting how a blending mode will affect an image
is difficult even if you have this background knowledge. So just play around
with the available modes until you get an effect you like. For fun, I filled the
other two petals in Figure 13-15 using the Multiply and Difference modes.
To fill a selection with paint in Elements, follow these steps:
1. Select the area that you want to paint.
You can skip this step if you want to paint the entire photo (or current
layer, in a layered image). See Chapter 12 for help with selecting.
Multiply mode
Difference mode
Normal mode
Color mode

2. For safety’s sake, create a new layer to hold the paint.
You can do this by clicking the New Layer icon in the Layers palette, as
described in the preceding section. (Flip back to Figure 13-14 for a look
at the palette.) Alternatively, choose Layer➪New➪Layer. Click OK in the
resulting dialog box, accepting all the default dialog box settings.
3. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection. 
If you didn’t create a selection outline in Step 1, this command name
is Fill Layer instead of Fill Selection. Either way, you see the Fill Layer
dialog box, shown in Figure 13-16, after choosing the command.
Figure 13-16: Use the Fill command to dump color into a large area of your photo.
4. Set the fill options.
• Select your paint color from the Use drop-down list.
• Set the Mode and Opacity options at Normal and 100 percent,
respectively. You can more easily adjust these two characteristics
by using the controls in the Layers palette after filling the selection.
When you use the Layers palette controls, you can see the results
of your changes in the image window, a benefit you don’t get inside
the Fill Layer dialog box.
• Turn off the Preserve Transparency option.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box and pour paint into the selection.
6. In the Layers palette, adjust the blending mode and opacity as needed.
Again, refer to Figure 13-14 for a look at these two controls.
7. When you’re satisfied with the paint job, choose Layer➪Merge Down
to permanently glue the paint layer to the original image.

Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
When you want to fill a selection with the current foreground color, you can
bypass the Fill Layer dialog box by simply pressing Alt+Delete (or Option+
Delete on a Macintosh). Press Ctrl+Delete (or Ô+Delete) to fill the area with
the background color.
One final word about painting: I suggest that you ignore the Elements Paint
Bucket tool, which is also provided for the purpose of filling large areas.
When you click with the tool, it hunts for pixels that match the color you
clicked, just like the Magic Wand selection tool. Then it paints all those
pixels. The problem is that it’s difficult to find exactly the right spot to
click to color only the pixels you want to paint. For faster, more accurate
results, create your selection outline and then use the Fill Layer command
instead.
Smudging Paint
The Smudge tool, found in many photo editors, isn’t so much a painting tool
as a paint-smearing tool. Producing an effect similar to what you’d get if you
dragged your finger through a wet oil painting, the tool takes the color under-
neath your cursor and smears it over other pixels that you drag over. 
To get an idea of the kind of effects you can create with the Smudge tool, see
Figure 13-17. I used the tool to give my vintage toucan pitcher a new ’do. To
create the effect, I just dragged upward from the crown of the bird.
Figure 13-17: I used the Smudge tool to give my toucan a change of hairstyle.

In Elements, the Smudge tool is located near the paint color controls, sharing
a flyout menu with the Blur and Sharpen tools. As shown in Figure 13-18, the
options bar for this tool offers a Brushes palette, Size control, and Mode con-
trol, just like the Brush tool. Refer to the earlier section, “Exploring Brush and
Pencil options” for the scoop on these controls. You also have access to some
smudging-only options:
 Finger Painting: For standard smudging, turn this option off, as shown
in Figure 13-18. When the option is enabled, the Smudge tool smears the
current foreground paint color over your image instead of the color that’s
under your cursor at the start of your drag. 
 Strength: You also can adjust the impact of the Smudge tool by using the
Strength control. At full strength, the Smudge tool smears the initial color
over the full length of your drag. At lower strengths, color isn’t smeared
over the entire distance. I used a setting of 90 on my toucan.
Figure 13-18: Drag with the Smudge tool to smear paint.

 Use All Layers: When you select this option, the Smudge tool smears
colors from every visible image layer. This enables you to do your smudg-
ing on a layer separate from the rest of the photo, as shown in Figure 13-18.
To create a new layer, click the New Layer icon in the Layers palette, vis-
ible in the figure. (See the section “Uncovering Layers of Possibility,” later
in this chapter, for more information about working with image layers.)
Spinning Pixels around the Color Wheel
Another way to play with the colors in your image is to use the Hue filter, if
your photo editor provides one.
The Hue filter takes pixels on a ride
around the color wheel, which is a
circular graph of available hues.
Red is located at the 0-degree 
position on the circle, green at 120
degrees, and blue at 240 degrees,
as shown in Figure 13-19. When 
you apply the filter, you send
pixels so many degrees around the
wheel. If you start with red, for
example, and set the filter value 
to 120 degrees, your pixel travels
120 degrees clockwise and
becomes green.
To change the apple color in the
middle image in Figure 13-20, for
example, I first selected the apple.
Then I set the filter value to –83 degrees, spinning the red apple pixels coun-
terclockwise around the wheel to the purple position.
Figure 13-20: Changing colors via the Hue filter produces slightly different results than painting the pixels
using the Color blending mode.

Compare this result with the apple on the right, which I filled with purple
paint using the Color blending mode. At first glance, the results look similar.
But with a Color-mode paint job, all pixels are filled with the same hue — in
the apple, for example, you get lighter and darker shades of purple, but the
basic color is purple throughout. The Hue filter shifted the red apple pixels
to purple but shifted the yellowish-green areas near the center of the fruit to
light pink. Also, a Color fill does not affect black or white pixels, while the
Hue filter does not affect white, black, or gray pixels.
To recolor pixels with the Hue filter in Elements, first select those pixels, get-
ting help from Chapter 12 if needed. Then choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Hue/Saturation. You see the dialog box shown in Figure 13-21. Drag the
Hue slider to shift the color of the selected area. (Turn on the Preview check
box so that you can see the results of your changes in the image window.)
Click OK to close the dialog box.
Figure 13-21: Drag the Hue slider to shift the color of all 
selected pixels.
Creating a Tinted or Grayscale Photo
Many digital cameras enable you to shoot grayscale or sepia-toned images.
However, I suggest that you instead capture your images in full color and
then create grayscale or sepia versions using your photo software. You get
more control over the final image going that route. Additionally, although you
can always use your photo software to go from full-color to grayscale or sepia,
the opposite isn’t possible.
315
Chapter 13: Amazing Stuff Even You Can Do

316
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Even the most basic photo-editing
programs typically offer one-click 
filters for creating grayscale or
sepia images. In Elements, for exam-
ple, you can produce a grayscale
photo by choosing Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Remove Color, as I did for the
photo in Figure 13-22. (Be sure to
choose Remove Color, not Remove
Color Cast.)
Note that the Remove Color com-
mand turns your picture gray but
leaves it in the RGB color mode,
which means that you can then paint
on the photo using colored paint if
you like. When you paint using the
Color blending mode, discussed ear-
lier, you can create the look of a
hand-tinted photo this way.
Elements doesn’t provide a one-step
sepia-toning filter, but the effect is
easy to create just the same. Simply
choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Hue/Saturation to open the
Hue/Saturation dialog box, as shown
in Figure 13-23. Select the Colorize
check box and then drag the Hue
slider until you find a tint color
you like. You’re not limited to sepia
tones — you can choose any tint that suits your eye. Tweak the effect by
using the Lightness and Saturation sliders in the dialog box.
Figure 13-23: The Colorize option in the Hue/Saturation dialog box is the key to a sepia-toned photo in Elements.
Figure 13-22: Most photo editors offer a one-
click filter that converts a color photo to a
grayscale image.

Be sure to save your grayscale or tinted photo with a different name from
the original! Otherwise, you overwrite the original image, and you can’t get
your original colors back if you need them later.
Uncovering Layers of Possibility
Photoshop Elements, Photoshop, and many other photo-editing programs
provide an extremely useful feature called layers. Layers sometimes go by
other names, such as Objects, Sprites, or Lenses. But whatever the name, this
feature is key to creating many artistic effects and is also extremely helpful
for ordinary retouching work.
To understand how layers work, think of those clear sheets of acetate used to
create transparencies for overhead projectors. Suppose that on the first sheet,
you paint a birdhouse. On the next sheet, you draw a bird. And on the third
sheet, you add some blue sky and some green grass. If you stack the sheets
on top of each other, the bird, birdhouse, and scenic background appear as
though they are all part of the same picture.
Layers work just like that. You place different elements of your image on 
different layers, and when you stack all the layers on top of each other, you
see the composite image — the elements of all the layers merged together.
Where one layer is empty, pixels from the underlying layer show through.
You gain several image-editing advantages from layers:
 You can shuffle the stacking order of layers to create different pictures
from the same layers. (Stacking order is just a fancy way of referring to
the arrangement of layers in your image.) Figures 13-24 and 13-25 offer an
example. Both images contain three layers: one for the pond and trees,
one for the iguana, and one for the water lily. Next to each picture, you
can see the Elements Layers palette, which shows the stacking order.
Checkerboard areas indicate empty portions of the two top layers.
(The next section details the palette.)
The pond-and-trees scene occupies the bottom layer in both pictures.
In the first image, I put the iguana on the second layer and placed the
water lily on the top layer. Because the lily obscures most of the reptile
layer, the picture appears to show nothing more menacing than a giant,
mutant water lily. Reversing the order of the top two layers reveals that
what appeared to be the stem of the flower actually is the tail of a sci-
ence experiment gone wrong.
To make the end of the tail appear to be immersed in the water, I partially
erased it. You can read more about this technique in “Editing a multilay-
ered image,” later in this chapter.
317
Chapter 13: Amazing Stuff Even You Can Do

318
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 13-24: When the lily layer is at the top of the layer stack, it obscures the iguana that
lives on the middle layer.
 Layers make experimenting easier. You can edit objects on one layer of
your image without affecting the pixels on the other layers. So you can
apply paint tools, retouching tools, and even image-correction tools to
just one layer, leaving the rest of the image untouched. You can even
move or delete an entire layer without repercussions.
Suppose that you wanted to get rid of the water lily, for example, so that
the iguana would appear to walk on water. If the lily, reptile, and back-
ground all existed on the same layer, deleting the lily would leave a
flower-shaped hole in the image. But because the three elements are on
separate layers, you can simply delete the lily layer. In place of the jetti-
soned flower petals, the water from the background layer appears.
 You can vary layer opacity to create different effects. Figure 13-26
shows an example. Both images contain two layers: The rose is on the
top layer, while the faded wood occupies the bottom layer. In the left
image, I set the opacity of both layers to 100 percent. In the right image,
I lowered the opacity of the rose layer to 50 percent so that the wood
image is partially visible through the rose. The result is a ghostly rose
that almost looks like part of the wood.

Figure 13-25: Swapping the order of the top two layers reveals the iguana.
Figure 13-26: At left, the rose layer rests atop the wood layer at 100 percent opacity. At right, I set the rose
layer opacity to 50 percent, turning the rose into a ghost of its former self.
319
Chapter 13: Amazing Stuff Even You Can Do

320
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
 You can vary how the colors
in one layer merge with those
in the underlying layers by
applying different blending
modes. Layer blending modes
work just like the fill and paint
blending modes discussed 
earlier in this chapter. In Fig-
ure 13-27, for example, I set the
rose layer back to 100 percent
opacity. But instead of using
the Normal blending mode, as
I did for Figure 13-26, I set the
rose layer’s blending mode to
Color Burn.
 In some programs, you can
apply an assortment of auto-
matic layer effects. Elements,
for example, provides an effect
that adds a drop shadow to the layer. If you move the layer, the
shadow moves with it. (To explore the effects, open the Styles and
Effects palette via the Window menu.) I took advantage of this feature
to add subtle shadows underneath the water lily and iguana in Figures
13-24 and 13-25.
Not all photo-editing programs provide all these layer options, and some
entry-level programs don’t provide layers at all. But if your program offers
layers, I urge you to spend some time getting acquainted with this feature.
I promise that you will never go back to unlayered editing after you do.
Layers do have one drawback, however: Each layer increases the file size of
your image and forces your computer to expend more memory to process
the image. So after you’re happy with your image, you should smash all the
layers together to reduce the file size — a process known as flattening or
merging, in image-editing parlance.
After you merge layers, though, you can no longer manipulate or edit the
individual layer elements without affecting the rest of the image. So if you
think you may want to play around with the image more in the future, save
a copy in a file format that supports layers. Check your software’s Help
system for specifics on flattening and preserving layers. If you want more
specifics on using layers, the next sections provide some basics about layer
functions in Elements. Although the steps for taking advantage of layer func-
tions vary from program to program, the available features tend to be similar
no matter what the program. So reading through the instructions I give for
Elements should give you a head start on understanding your program’s lay-
ering tools.
Figure 13-27: Here, the rose was layered on top
of the wood at 100 percent opacity, but with the
layer blending mode set to Color Burn.

Working with Elements layers
To view, arrange, and otherwise manipulate image layers in Photoshop
Elements, you need to display the Layers palette, shown in Figure 13-28. To
open the palette, choose Window➪Layers. As I did elsewhere in this book,
I dragged the palette out of the Palette Bin to create a free-floating entity.
Figure 13-28: The Layers palette is key to managing layers in Elements.
Here’s a quick tour of the Layers palette:
 Each layer in the image is listed in the palette. To the left of the layer
name is a thumbnail view of the layer contents.
 By default, transparent areas appear as a checkerboard pattern, as
shown in the figure.
 Only one layer at a time is active — that is, available for editing. The active
layer is highlighted in the Layers palette. In Figure 13-28, the Iguana layer
is active. To make a different layer active, click its name in the palette.

322
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
 Speaking of layer names, they’re assigned by default as Layer 1, Layer 2,
and so on. To rename a layer, double-click its name in the palette.
 The eyeball icon indicates whether the layer is visible in the image. Click
the icon to hide the eyeball and the layer. Click in the now-empty eyeball
column to redisplay the layer.
 You can quickly add or delete a layer by clicking the New Layer and Trash
icons at the top of the palette. For more on adding and deleting layers,
pass your peepers over the next section.
 Click the Adjustment Layer icon to create a special type of layer that
enables you to apply color and exposure changes without permanently
altering the original image. Space constraints prevent me from covering
this feature, but it’s very worthwhile to explore on your own.
 The Blending Mode menu and Opacity control enable you to adjust the
way that pixels on a layer blend with pixels on the layer below. These
controls work just like the blending mode and opacity controls described
earlier, in the discussion about the paint tools and Fill command, except
that the controls in the Layers palette affect pixels that already exist on
a layer. By contrast, the controls for the paint tools and Fill command
affect pixels that you’re about to paint.
 The Lock controls near the top of the palette enable you to “lock” the
contents of a layer, thereby preventing you from messing up a layer after
you get it just so. The leftmost of the two lock controls prevents you from
making any changes to transparent parts of the layer; the right control
prevents you from altering the entire layer. However, in either case, you
can still move the layer up and down in the layer stack.
 The little f icon to the right of a layer name indicates that you’ve applied
a special effect via the Styles and Effects palette. Double-clicking the icon,
labeled Effects icon in Figure 13-28, opens a dialog box where you can
tweak the effect.
To preserve independent layers between editing sessions, you must save the
image file in a format that supports layers — that is, can deal with the layers fea-
ture. In Elements, go with the program’s native format, PSD, or TIFF. Be sure to
select the Layers check box in the Save As dialog box as well. See Chapter 11
for more details about saving files.
Adding, deleting, and flattening layers
Every Elements image starts life with one layer, named Background layer. You
can add and delete layers as follows:
 Add a new, empty layer: Choose Layer➪New➪Layer and then click OK in
the resulting dialog box. Or, even faster, just click the New Layer icon in
the Layers palette. (Refer to Figure 13-28.) Your new layer appears directly
above the layer that was active at the time you clicked the icon. The new
layer becomes the active layer automatically.

 Duplicate a layer: Drag the layer to the New Layer icon. Or click the
layer in the Layers palette and then choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy.
 Delete a layer: Drag the layer name to the Trash icon in the Layers
palette. Or click the layer name, choose Layer➪Delete Layer, and then
click Yes in the confirmation dialog box. All pixels on the layer disappear.
 Combine all layers (flatten the image): Flattening an image reduces the
file size and the amount of muscle your computer needs to process your
edits. After you flatten the image, however, you can no longer manipu-
late the layers independently. So you may want to make a backup copy
of the picture in its multilayered state before you go ahead. Then choose
Layer➪Flatten Image.
 Merge selected layers: In addition to flattening all layers, you can merge
just two or more selected layers:
• To merge a layer with the layer immediately underneath, click the
upper layer in the pair and then choose Layer➪Merge Down.
• To merge two layers that aren’t adjacent, or to merge more than
two layers, first hide the layers that you don’t want to fuse together.
(Click their eyeball icons in the Layers palette.) Then choose Layer➪
Merge Visible. After you merge the visible layers, redisplay the
hidden layers.
Editing a multilayered image
Editing multilayered images involves a few differences from editing a single-
layer image. Here’s the scoop:
 Changing layer stacking order: Drag a layer name up or down in the
Layers palette.
 Selecting the entire layer: To select an entire layer, just click its name
in the Layers palette. For some commands, however, you must choose
Select➪Select All to create a layer-wide selection outline. (If a command
that you want to use appears dimmed in a menu, this is likely the cause.)
 Selecting part of a layer: Use the selection techniques outlined in
Chapter 12 to create a selection outline as usual. Then click the layer
name in the Layers palette, if the layer isn’t already the active layer.
A selection outline always affects the active layer, even if another layer
was active when you created the outline.
 Copy a selected area to a new layer: Press Ctrl+J in Windows; press
Ô+J on a Mac. Or choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy. Your selection
goes on a new layer immediately above the layer that was active when
you made the copy.
 Deleting a selection: On any layer but the background layer, deleting
a selection creates a transparent hole in the layer, and the underlying
pixels show through the hole. If you delete a selection on the 
323
Chapter 13: Amazing Stuff Even You Can Do

324
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
background layer, the hole becomes filled with the current background
color. (See the earlier section “Setting the paint color” to find out how to
change the background color.)
 Erasing on a layer: On any
layer but the background
layer, you can also use the
Eraser tool to rub a hole in a
layer, as I did in Figure 13-29.
In the top image, you see my
iguana/flower combo as it
originally appeared — notice
the iguana’s tail. I partially
erased the end of the tail so
that it appears to be under
water, as shown in the lower
image.
As with the Elements painting
tools, you can adjust the
impact of the Eraser by
changing the Opacity value on
the options bar. At 100 per-
cent, you swipe the pixels
clean; anything less than
100 percent leaves some of
your pixels behind, making
them translucent. For my
iguana tail, I used a soft brush
and set the tool opacity to
50 percent. Figure 13-30
shows this process. I hid the
bottom, pond layer so that
you can see what I’m erasing
more clearly. Again, the
checkerboard pattern indi-
cates transparent pixels. 
 Erasing on the background layer: On the background (bottom) layer,
applying the Eraser tool doesn’t result in a transparent area. Instead, the
erased area is filled with the current background color, just as when you
delete something from the background layer.
 Moving a layer: Click the layer name in the Layers palette to select the
layer. Then drag in the image window with the Move tool, labeled in
Figure 13-30. If the Auto Select Layer check box is selected on the options
bar, clicking any pixel on a layer automatically selects the layer that con-
tains that pixel.
 Transforming a layer: After clicking the layer name in the Layers palette,
use the commands on the Image➪Transform and Image➪Rotate menus
to rotate, flip, and otherwise transform a layer. You can use the same
Figure 13-29: I used the Eraser tool to partially
erase the end of the iguana’s tail so that it looks
as though it is under water.

techniques and commands as when you transform a selection; Chapter
12 offers details. (Be sure to use the Rotate commands that include the
word Layer in the name, or you affect the entire image.)
Resizing and rotating image elements can damage your image quality. You
can typically reduce your image without harm, but don’t try to enlarge
the image very much, and don’t rotate the same layer repeatedly.
 Converting the background layer to a regular layer: Click the back-
ground layer name in the Layers palette and then choose Layer➪
New➪Layer from Background. Click OK in the dialog box that appears.
After you take this step, you can manipulate the background layer as
you can any other layer. You also can make parts of the layer transpar-
ent. However, if you save the file in a format that doesn’t support layers,
any transparent pixels on the bottom layer are filled with solid color.
When you save a file in the JPEG format, you can choose the color that
fills those transparent areas; head to Chapter 10 for details.

Building a multilayered collage
Layers are useful on an everyday-editing basis because they provide you with
more flexibility and security. But layers also shine in the creation of photo
collages like the one in Figure 13-31. I put this collage together for a market-
ing piece for my part-time antiques business, which focuses on the kind of
small, whimsical decorating items featured in the image. 
Figure 13-31: Here you see the individual collage elements, shown according to their stacking
order in the composite image.
To help you understand the process of creating a collage — and hopefully
provide you with a little inspiration — the following list outlines the approach
I took to produce this image:
1. I opened each of the collage images individually and did whatever color
correction and touch-ups were needed to get the images in good shape.
I also set the image resolution and dimensions using the steps outlined
in Chapter 9. Then I saved and closed the images.
2. To begin building the collage, I first opened the brick image.

3. One by one, I opened the other collage images and selected, copied, and
pasted the subjects into the brick picture. You can find out how to select,
copy, and paste in Chapter 12.
4. I kept each collage element on its own layer, which meant eight layers
altogether. You see the stacking order of the layers in Figure 13-31. I repo-
sitioned and rotated the individual layers, playing around with different
compositions until I arrived at the final image.
In a few cases, I scaled individual elements down slightly, using the Free
Transform command discussed in Chapter 12. (Remember, reducing a
photo element is usually harmless; enlarging it usually does noticeable
damage.) With the exception of the elf’s head and the bottle stopper
(that’s the little guy in the bowler hat), I oriented the objects in a way
that moved at least some of the original image off the canvas area.
5. To make the elf’s head appear partially in front of and partially behind
the iron, I put the elf layer under the iron layer. Then I used the Eraser
tool to wipe away the iron pixels around the elf’s ears and chin.
6. I saved one copy of the image in its layered state so that I could retain
the layers for further editing in case the mood to do some rearranging
hit me. Then, because I needed to turn this image over to the folks in the
publisher’s production department for printing, I flattened the image and
saved it as a TIFF file. (See Chapter 9 for details on saving TIFF files.)
Working with multiple images and large images such as this collage can strain
even the most hardy computer system. So be sure to save your collage at reg-
ular intervals so that you’re protected in the case of a system breakdown.
And be sure to save in your photo software’s native format; other formats
may flatten all your layers together.
Turning Garbage into Art
Sometimes, no amount of color correction, sharpening, or other editing can
rescue an image. The top-left photo in Figure 13-32 is an example. I shot this
cityscape just past sunset, and I knew I was pushing the limits of my camera.
Just as I feared, the image came out very grainy due to the dim lighting.
After trying all sorts of corrective edits, I decided that this image was never
going to be acceptable in its “real” state. That is, I wasn’t able to capture the
scene with enough detail and brightness to create a decent printed or on-
screen image. Still, I really liked the composition and colors of the picture.
So I decided to use it as a basis for some digital creativity.

328
Part IV: Tricks of the Digital Trade 
Figure 13-32: Don’t delete out-of-focus or grainy pictures automatically; with the help of special effects
filters, they may provide the basis for some interesting artwork.
By applying different special-effects filters, I created the three other images
in the figure. For these pictures, I used filters found in Elements. You can find
similar filters — or equally entertaining filters — in other programs.
In just a few seconds, I was able to take a lousy photograph and turn it into
an interesting composition. And these samples are just the beginning of the
creative work you can do. You can combine different filters, play with layer-
ing and blending modes, and use any of the other editing tricks discussed
throughout this chapter and the others in this part of the book to create 
colorful, inventive artwork.
In other words, the artistic possibilities you can achieve with digital photos
aren’t limited to the scene you see when you look through the viewfinder. Nor
are you restricted to the image that appears on your screen when you first
open it in your photo software. So never give up on a rotten picture — if you
look hard enough, you can find art in them-there pixels.

D
igital cameras have a high “wow” factor. That is,
when you whip out your camera and start
taking pictures, you have a good chance that some
bystander will say, “Wow!” and ask for a closer look.
Sooner or later, though, people stop being dis-
tracted by the flashy technology of your camera and
start paying attention to the quality of the pictures
you turn out. And if your images are poor, whether in
terms of photo quality or composition, the initial
“wows” turn to “ews,” as in “Ew, that picture’s terrible.
You’d think after spending all that money on a digital
camera, you could come up with something better than that.”
So that you don’t embarrass yourself — photographically speaking, anyway —
this chapter presents ten ways to create better digital images. If you pay
attention to these guidelines, your audience will be as captivated by your 
pictures as they are by your shiny digital camera.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Remember the Resolution!
When you print digital photos, the image output resolution — the number of
pixels per linear inch, or ppi — has a big impact on picture quality, as illus-
trated by Figure 14-1. The first image has a resolution of 300 ppi; the second,
75 ppi.
Figure 14-1: The poor quality of the right image is due to a lack of pixels.
Most digital cameras offer a few different capture settings, each of which
delivers a certain number of pixels. Before you take a picture, consider how
large you may want to print the photo. Then select the capture setting that
delivers enough pixels to print a good picture at that size. For most printers,
you need at least 200 pixels per inch, so just multiply your desired print size
by that number to determine your pixel requirements. (The Cheat Sheet at
the front of the book offers a resolution reference table for math-haters in the
crowd.) Your printer may produce better results when fed more pixels, how-
ever, so check the manual and experiment with different pixel counts.
Remember that you usually can get rid of excess pixels in your photo soft-
ware without affecting picture quality, but you almost never get good results
from adding pixels. In other words, it’s better to wind up with too many
pixels than too few.
For the complete lowdown on resolution, see Chapter 2.

Don’t Overcompress Your Images
Today’s digital cameras commonly store images in the JPEG (jay-peg) file
format. As the image is saved, it goes through a process known as JPEG com-
pression. JPEG compression dumps some image data in order to create
smaller picture files, enabling you to fit more pictures on a memory card.
This process is sometimes referred to as lossy compression because it results
in a loss of picture data.
Most cameras give you a choice of JPEG settings, each of which applies a dif-
ferent amount of compression. In most cases, these settings have quality-
related names — Best, Better, Good, for example, or Fine and Normal. That’s
appropriate because JPEG compression affects picture quality. The more
JPEG compression you apply, the more image data you lose, and the lower
the photo quality.
Some cameras also enable you to shoot in other formats, notably TIFF and
Camera Raw, which do not apply lossy compression. Your picture files will be
substantially larger, however, and you may notice little difference between a
JPEG picture taken at the highest quality setting and a picture taken using the
other two formats.
Compression and pixel count work
together to determine picture quality.
Combine heavy compression with too
few pixels, and you get a blurry,
blocky mess like you see in Figure
14-2. This image shows the low-reso-
lution photo from Figure 14-2 after it
was subjected to maximum JPEG
compression. 
To find out more about this issue, flip
to Chapter 5.
Look for the Unexpected
Angle
As explored in Chapter 7, changing the angle from which you photograph
your subject can add impact and interest to the picture. Instead of shooting a
subject straight on, investigate the unexpected angle — lie on the floor and
get a bug’s-eye-view, for example, or perch yourself on a sturdy chair and cap-
ture the subject from above.

heavy JPEG compression results in
unacceptable picture quality.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
As you compose your scenes, also remember the rule of thirds — divide the
frame into vertical and horizontal thirds and position the main focal point of
the shot at a spot where the dividing lines intersect. And quickly scan the
frame for any potentially distracting background elements before you press
the shutter button.
For more tips on how to take better digital photos, see Chapters 6 and 7.
Turn Down the Noise
Digital photos sometimes suffer from a defect called noise, which makes your
image appear as though someone sprinkled colored sand over it. (Chapter 6
provides an illustration.)
You can combat noise in two ways:
 Add light, either by using your camera’s flash or switching on some
other light source. Noise typically appears when the lighting is too dim.
 If your camera offers a choice of ISO settings, try lowering the ISO value,
too. This control increases your camera’s sensitivity to light, allowing
you to shoot in dim lighting. But on many cameras, a high ISO setting
has the unwanted side effect of increasing noise. Of course, as you lower
the ISO value, you need to add light to capture a good picture.
For times when you can’t eliminate noise, see Chapter 11 for tips on how to
soften the defect in a photo-editing program.
Press the Shutter Button Correctly
This tip usually sounds silly to people who hear it for the first time. But one
of the most common reasons for improperly exposed or out-of-focus pictures
is improper shutter-button technique.
Most digital cameras feature automatic exposure and automatic focus. For
these automatic mechanisms to work correctly, you must take a two-step
approach to snapping a picture.
After framing the shot, press the shutter button halfway and hold it there. In
a second or two, the camera beeps or displays a light, which is your signal
that the focus and exposure have been set. You can then press the shutter
button the rest of the way to record the image.

If you merely jab the shutter button down in one quick press, you don’t give
the camera the brief moment it needs to set exposure and focus properly.
Turn Off Digital Zoom
Digital zoom is a feature offered on most digital cameras. From its name,
you’d naturally expect that digital zoom does the same thing as an optical
(traditional) zoom lens — that is, make faraway objects appear closer and
larger in the frame. 
In truth, though, digital zoom is simply a software process that enlarges the
existing image and then crops away the perimeter. You get exactly the same
results as if you had done this enlarging and cropping in a photo-editing pro-
gram. As covered in Chapter 2, enlarging a digital photo can reduce picture
quality, which is why I recommend turning off digital zoom.
Digital zoom also does not affect depth of field — the zone of sharp focus —
like a real zoom lens. For more about depth of field and working with an opti-
cal zoom, see Chapters 6 and 7, respectively.
Take Advantage of Your Photo Editor
Don’t automatically toss photos that don’t look as good as you would like.
With some judicious use of your photo software’s retouching tools, you can
brighten underexposed images, correct color balance, crop out distracting
background elements, and even cover up small blemishes. 
Part IV explores some basic techniques you can use to enhance your images.
Some are simple, requiring just one click of the mouse button. Others involve
a bit more effort but are still easily mastered if you put in a little time.
Being able to edit your photographs is one of the major advantages of digital
photography. So take a few minutes each day to become acquainted with
your photo software’s correction commands, filters, and tools. After you start
using them, you’ll wonder how you got along without them.
Print Your Images on Good Paper
As discussed in Chapter 9, the type of paper you use when printing your
images can have a dramatic effect on how your pictures look. The same pic-
ture that appears blurry, dark, and oversaturated when printed on cheap
copy paper can look sharp, bright, and glorious when printed on special
glossy photographic paper.
335
Chapter 14: Ten Ways to Improve Your Digital Images

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you’re having your digital photos printed at a retail lab, you can count on
getting good quality paper. But if you’re doing the job on a home printer,
check your printer’s manual for information on the ideal paper to use with
your model. Some printers are engineered to work with a specific brand of
paper, but don’t be afraid to experiment with paper from other manufactur-
ers. Paper vendors are furiously developing new papers that are specifically
designed for printing digital images on consumer-level color printers, so you
may just find something that works even better than the recommended
paper.
Practice, Practice, Practice!
Digital photography is no different from any other skill in that the more you
do it, the better you become. So shoot as many pictures as you can, in as
many different light situations as you can. As you shoot, jot down the camera
settings you used and the lighting conditions at the time you snapped the
image. Later, evaluate the pictures to see which settings worked the best in
which situations.
If your camera stores the capture settings as EXIF metadata in the image file,
as most new cameras do, you don’t need to bother writing down settings for
each shot. Instead, you can use a special piece of software to view the cap-
ture settings for each image that you download to your computer. See
Chapter 4 for more information on this option.
After you spend some time experimenting with your camera, you’ll start to
gain an instinctive feel for what tactics to use in different shooting scenarios,
increasing the percentage of great pictures in your portfolio. As for those pic-
tures that don’t make the grade, keep them to yourself, suggests Alfred
DeBat, technical editor for this book and an experienced professional photog-
rapher. “Never share your bad photos! Show your friends and family ten
really outstanding pictures, and they will say, ‘Wow! You really are a great
photographer.’ If you show them 50 great photos and 50 mediocre shots, they
won’t be impressed with your abilities. So bury your bad pictures if you want
to build a reputation as a good photographer.”
Read the Manual (Gasp!)
Remember that instruction manual that came with your camera? The one you
promptly stuffed in a drawer without bothering to read? Go get it. Then sit
down and spend an hour devouring every bit of information inside it.

I know, I know. Manuals are deadly boring, which is why you invested in this
book, which is so dang funny you find yourself slapping your knee and snort-
ing milk through your nose at almost every paragraph. But you aren’t going
to get the best pictures out of your camera unless you understand how all 
its controls work. I can give you general recommendations and instructions
in this book, but for camera-specific information, the best resource is the
manufacturer’s own manual.
After your initial read-through, drag the manual out every so often and take
another pass at it. You’ll probably discover the answer to some problem that’s
been plaguing your pictures or be reminded of some option that you forgot
was available. In fact, reading the manual has to be one of the easiest — and
most overlooked — ways to get better performance out of your camera.

Ten Great Uses for Digital Images
In This Chapter
 Posting online photo albums
 Turning your favorite pictures into a screen saver
 Pasting photo wallpaper onto your computer desktop
 Creating “oil paintings” and other digital art out of photos
 Putting your smiling face on a coffee cup or T-shirt
 Publishing custom calendars, greeting cards, or stationery
 Adding pictures to spreadsheets and databases
 Creating photo name badges and business cards
 Showing ’em what you mean
 Printing and framing your best work
M
ost people are aware of the two most common uses
for digital images: adding pictures to Web sites and
sending photos via e-mail. But sharing pictures online is
just the start of the fun. This chapter introduces you
to several creative photo projects, including turning
a picture into digital art and publishing a photo cal-
endar. And just in case you need a reason other than
pleasure to justify your camera purchase, this chap-
ter also suggests some practical business and
household uses for digital photos.
Creating Online Photo Albums
Want an easy way to show off your pictures? Check out online
photo-sharing sites. Using simple tools provided at these sites, you can
create digital photo albums and post them online. You can then invite friends
and family to view your pictures at the site. Even better, the people who view
your albums can order prints through the site, saving you the trouble and
expense of making copies for everyone.

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Posting and sharing albums is usually free. You pay only for prints that you
order. To get started, check out these leading photo-sharing sites:
 www.kodakgallery.com (formerly Ofoto)
 www.shutterfly.com
 www.snapfish.com
Chapter 10 offers a look at an online album that I created at Snapfish; you can
get a glimpse of the Kodak photo-sharing site in Chapter 1.
One word of caution: Don’t rely on a photo-sharing site for storage of impor-
tant, irreplaceable photos. If the site experiences problems with its equip-
ment — or worse, goes out of business — you can lose your photos. Many
sites delete your online images if you don’t buy any prints or other photo
products within a certain period of time, too. See Chapter 4 for guidance
about more secure image-storage options.
Putting Together a Screen Saver
In the early years of computing, a monitor could be damaged if the same text
or graphics stayed on-screen for a long time. To address that problem, the
screen saver was born. A screen saver is a series of images that display auto-
matically any time the system is idle for a period of time.
With today’s monitors, screen savers aren’t necessary, but they do offer a
great way to display your favorite photos. You can replace the generic screen
savers that ship with most computers with a custom screen saver that fea-
tures your favorite images.
Before you begin, make sure that your photos are in the JPEG file format. If
not, follow the instructions in Chapter 10 for saving JPEG files.
Here’s how to create a screen saver in Windows XP:
1. Put the pictures that you want to use for the screen saver in the My
Pictures folder.
This folder is located within the My Documents folder on your com-
puter’s hard drive.
2. Right-click an empty area of the computer desktop to display a small
pop-up menu.
3. On the pop-up menu, click Properties.
You see the Display Properties dialog box.

4. Click the Screen Saver tab to reveal the options shown in Figure 15-1.
Figure 15-1: Use your favorite photos as a screen saver.
5. From the Screen Saver drop-down list, choose My Pictures Slideshow,
as shown in the figure.
The photos in your My Pictures folder start to scroll through the pre-
view area at the top of the dialog box. You can customize the screen-
saver operation by using the options underneath the drop-down list.
Click the Settings button to access additional options.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box.
If you’re a Mac user, the following steps show you how to create a screen
saver in OS X:
1. Put the images you want to use for your screen saver in a single
folder.
The folder name and location don’t matter; just make sure that the
folder contains only your screen saver images.

2. Open the Apple menu and choose System Preferences.
The System Preferences dialog box appears.
3. Click the Show All icon in the upper-left corner of the dialog box.
The dialog box now displays icons for all the available preferences 
settings.
4. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon.
5. Click the Screen Saver button to display the options shown in Figure
15-2.
6. In the left side of the dialog box, select the folder that contains your
screen-saver photos.
The preview area starts displaying the photos in the folder. Customize
the screen saver operation by using the options underneath the preview.
Click the Options button to uncover additional settings.
7. Close the Desktop & Screen Saver dialog box.
Figure 15-2: In Mac OS X, head for the Desktop & Screen Saver area of the System
Preferences dialog box.

If you have trouble with any part of this process, your photo-editing program
or cataloging software may provide some assistance. Many entry-level pro-
grams offer a wizard that automatically sets up a screen saver.
Hanging Photo Wallpaper
Wallpaper is the official name of the image that appears on your computer
desktop — the main computer screen. Instead of sticking with the standard
Windows or Mac wallpaper, you can plaster one of your favorite photos on
the desktop, as I did in Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-3: Select a favorite photo to use as your desktop wallpaper. 
If you want the photo to fill a specific amount of the desktop, visit Chapter 10
for instructions on how to size photos for the screen. 
As with screen saver photos, make sure that your wallpaper photo is in the
JPEG format. See Chapter 10 if you need help saving a file in that format. (You
may be able to use other formats, too, depending on your operating system.)
In Windows XP, follow these steps:
1. Open the Desktop Properties dialog box.
You can do so by right-clicking an empty area of the computer desktop
and then choosing Properties from the pop-up menu.

2. Inside the dialog box, click the Desktop tab to display the options
shown in Figure 15-4.
Figure 15-4: Click the Browse button to select the photo you want to use as your wallpaper.
3. Click the Browse button to open the Browse dialog box.
This dialog box works like any dialog box you use to open a picture file. 
4. Select the photo you want to use and click Open to close the Browse
dialog box.
Your picture appears in the preview area of the Desktop Properties
dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-4. Use the other dialog box options to
customize your new wallpaper and then click OK.
Here are the steps in Mac OS X:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu to open the System
Preferences dialog box.
2. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon.
Don’t see the icon? Click the Show All icon at the top of the dialog box.
The dialog box then displays all the available System Preferences icons.

3. Click the Desktop button inside the Desktop & Screen Saver dialog
box.
4. Using the folder list on the left side of the dialog box, locate the folder
that contains your photo.
5. In the thumbnail area of the dialog box, click the thumbnail for the
photo you want to use.
You can customize the wallpaper using the other options in the dialog
box. Close the dialog box when you finish.
Giving Photos an Artistic Twist
Nearly every photo-editing program offers an assortment of special-effects fil-
ters. Many of these filters make your photo appear as if you created it using
traditional art media — oil paint, watercolor, chalk, and so on. Other filters
create wild, futuristic effects, like the one you see in the right image in Figure
15-5. I created this effect using the Glowing Edges filter in Photoshop
Elements.
Figure 15-5: I created this cool effect using a simple, one-step filter in Photoshop Elements.
345
Chapter 15: Ten Great Uses for Digital Images

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Aside from offering a fun creative endeavor, special-effects filters can help
rescue a picture that’s slightly out of focus. Try applying a watercolor filter to
your soft-focus pictures, for example. A real watercolor painting usually has a
soft look, so no one will be the wiser that your original photo wasn’t sharp as
a tack. See Chapter 13 for some more examples of using special effects to
hide picture flaws.
Putting Your Mug on a Mug
If you own a photo printer, it may come with accessories that enable you to
put your images on mugs, T-shirts, and other objects. Online photo-sharing
sites such as those listed earlier in this chapter also can create these photo
wares for you.
Being a bit of a jaded person, I expected rather cheesy results from these kinds
of projects. But after I created my first set of mugs and saw the professional-
looking results, I was hooked. I chose four different images featuring my 
parents, my sisters, and my nieces and nephews and placed each image on a
different mug.
Call me sentimental, but I can envision these mugs being around for genera-
tions (assuming nobody breaks one, that is) to serve as a reminder of how we
twentieth-century Kings once looked. Hey, 100 years ago, nobody thought
that old tintype photographs would be considered heirlooms, right? So who’s
to say that my photographic mugs won’t be treasured tomorrow? In the
meantime, the family members who have laid claim to the mugs I created
seem to be treasuring them today.
Printing Photo Calendars and Cards
Many photo-editing programs include templates that enable you to create
customized calendars featuring your images. The only decision you need to
make is which picture to put on December’s page and which one to use on
July’s. You can also find templates for designing personalized greeting cards
and stationery.
If your photo editor doesn’t include such templates, check the software that
came with your printer. Many printers now ship with tools for creating calen-
dars and similar projects.

When you want more than a handful of copies of your creation, you may want
to have the piece professionally reproduced instead of printing each copy
one by one on your own printer. You can take the job to a quick-copy shop or
to a commercial service bureau or printer. Most online photo-sharing sites
also offer this service.
Including Visual Information in Databases
You can add digital images to company databases and spreadsheets in order
to provide employees with visual as well as text information. For example, if
you work in human resources, you can insert employee pictures into your
employee database. Or if you’re a small-business owner and maintain a prod-
uct inventory in a spreadsheet program, you can insert pictures of individual
products to help you remember which items go with which order numbers.
Chapter 1 includes an example of a spreadsheet that I created in Microsoft
Excel to track the inventory in my antique shop.
Merging text and pictures in this fashion isn’t just for business purposes,
though. You can take the same approach to create a household inventory for
your personal insurance records, for example.
Putting a Name with the Face
You can put digital pictures on business cards, employee badges, and
nametags for guests at a conference or other large gathering. I love getting
business cards that include the person’s face, for example, because I’m one
of those people who never forgets a face but almost always has trouble
remembering the name.
Several companies now offer special, adhesive-backed sticker paper for inkjet
printers. This paper is perfect for creating badges or nametags. After printing
the image, you simply stick it onto your preprinted badge or nametag.
Exchanging a Picture for a Thousand Words
Don’t forget the power of a photograph to convey an idea or describe a
scene. Did your roof suffer damage in last night’s windstorm? Take pictures
of the damage and e-mail them to your insurance agent and roofing contrac-
tor. Looking for a bookcase that will fit in with your existing office decor?
Take a picture of your office to the furniture store, and ask the designer for
suggestions.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Written descriptions can be easily misunderstood and also take a lot longer
to produce than shooting and printing a digital image. So don’t tell people
what you want or need — show ’em!
Hanging a Masterpiece on Your Wall
Many ideas discussed in this chapter capitalize on the special capabilities
that going digital offers you — the ability to display images on-screen, incor-
porate them into publishing projects, and so on. But you can also take a more
traditional approach and simply print and frame your favorite images.
Getting prints made is easier and cheaper than ever, too. You can simply take
your camera memory card into any retail photofinishing lab and have prints
made in an hour, just as you can do with film. Or, for even more convenience,
you can upload your picture files to the lab’s Web site, place your order, and
pick up the prints when time permits. You can even have those prints made
at a lab across the country — a great way to get your pictures to faraway
friends and family.
Of course, you can always print your own pictures on a home or office photo
printer, too. Today’s printers produce excellent results, and you can choose
from a variety of specialty papers to lend some additional interest to your
prints.
For details about both retail and do-it-yourself printing, visit Chapter 9. That
chapter also provides tips for making sure that your prints don’t fade or oth-
erwise deteriorate before their time.

Manufacturer Web Sites
Just about every manufacturer of digital-imaging hardware and software main-
tains a Web site. Typically, their sites are geared to marketing the company’s
products, but many also offer terrific tutorials and other learning resources
for newcomers to digital photography. Sites that rank high on my list include
the following:
 Kodak (www.kodak.com): Take a look at the Taking Great Pictures area.
 HP (www.hp.com): Take advantage of the free online classes offered in
the Home and Home Office section of the site.
 Fujifilm (www.fujifilm.com): Find your way to the Picture Your Life
pages offered in the Consumer Products section of this site.
 Wacom Technologies (www.wacom.com): Click the Tips link for photo
retouching tips and creative inspiration.
 Adobe (www.adobe.com): Travel via the Support link to the Adobe
Studio area for tutorials and feature articles related to photo editing and
digital painting.

Many vendors also make updates to software available through their Web
sites. For example, you may be able to download an updated printer driver or
a patch that fixes a bug in your photo software.

Bookmark the companion site for this book, too. I’ve posted the sample
images shown in Figure 16-1 so that you can work along with the projects
and examples. To keep download times short, the photos are low-resolution
copies of the pictures used in the book. All pictures are in the JPEG format.
(Forgive me for not including images that feature people; I know you’ll under-
stand that I don’t feel comfortable putting pictures of friends and family
online for all the world to access.)
You can also find links to software vendor Web sites here. At many of these
sites, you can download free trials of the programs mentioned in this book.
It’s a great way to “try before you buy” and make sure that a program really
meets your needs.

Glossary
C
an’t remember the difference between a pixel and a bit? Resolution and
resampling? Turn here for a quick refresher on that digital photography
term that’s stuck somewhere in the dark recesses of your brain and refuses
to come out and play.
24-bit image: An image containing approximately 16.7 million colors.
aliasing: Random color defects, usually caused by too much JPEG compression.
aperture: An opening made by an adjustable diaphragm, which permits light
to enter the camera lens and reach the image sensor. 
aperture-priority autoexposure: A semi-automatic exposure mode; the pho-
tographer sets the aperture, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter
speed to produce a good exposure.
artifact: Noise, an unwanted pattern, or some other defect caused by an
image capture, file compression, or a processing problem.
aspect ratio: The proportions of an image. 35mm film has an aspect ratio of
3:2; the standard digital camera aspect ratio is 4:3.
autoexposure: A feature that puts the camera in control of choosing the
proper exposure settings. See also aperture-priority autoexposure and 
shutter-priority autoexposure.
bit: Stands for binary digit; the basic unit of digital information. Eight bits
equals one byte.
bit depth: Refers to the number of bits available to store color information. A
standard digital camera image has a bit depth of 24 bits. Images with more
than 24 bits are called high-bit images.
burst mode: A special capture setting, offered on some digital cameras, that
records several images in rapid succession with one press of the shutter
button. Also called continuous capture mode.
byte: Eight bits. See bit.
Camera Raw: A file format offered by some digital cameras; records the
photo without applying any of the in-camera processing that is usually done
automatically when saving photos in other formats. Also known as Raw.

Digital Photography For Dummies, 5th Edition 
CCD: Short for charge-coupled device. One of two types of imaging sensors
used in digital cameras.
CIE Lab: A color model developed by the Commission Internationale de
l’Eclairage. Used mostly by digital-imaging professionals.
cloning: The process of copying one area of a digital photo and “painting” the
copy onto another area or picture.
CMOS: Pronounced see-moss. A much easier way to say complementary metal-
oxide semiconductor. A type of imaging sensor used in digital cameras; used
less often than CCD chips.
CMYK: The print color model, in which cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks
are mixed to produce colors.
color correction: The process of adjusting the amount of different colors in
an image (for example, reducing red or increasing green).
color model: A way of defining colors. In the RGB color model, for example,
all colors are created by blending red, green, and blue light. In the CMYK
model, colors are produced by mixing cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink.
color temperature: Refers to the amount of red, green, and blue light emitted
by a particular light source.
CompactFlash: A type of removable memory card used in many digital cam-
eras. A miniature version of a PC Card — about the size and thickness of a
matchbook.
compositing: Combining two or more images in a photo-editing program.
compression: A process that reduces the size of the image file by eliminating
some image data.
depth of field: The zone of sharp focus in a photograph.
digital zoom: A feature offered on most digital cameras; crops the perimeter
of the image and then enlarges the area at the center. Results in reduced
image quality.
downloading: Transferring data from one computer device to another.
dpi: Short for dots per inch. A measurement of how many dots of color a
printer can create per linear inch. Higher dpi means better print quality on
some types of printers, but on other printers, dpi is not as crucial.

DPOF: Stands for digital print order format. A feature offered by some digital
cameras that enables you to add print instructions to the image file; some
photo printers can read that information when printing your pictures directly
from a memory card.
driver: Software that enables a computer to interact with a digital camera,
printer, or other device.
dye-sub: Short for dye-sublimation. A type of printer that produces excellent
digital prints.
edges: Areas where neighboring image pixels are significantly different in
color; in other words, areas of high contrast.
EV compensation: A control that slightly increases or decreases the exposure
chosen by the camera’s autoexposure mechanism. EV stands for exposure
value; EV settings typically appear as EV 1.0, EV 0.0, EV –1.0, and so on.
EVF: An electronic viewfinder, which delivers an electronic pixel version of
what the camera lens actually captures through a small viewfinder display.
Different from an optical viewfinder, which employs lenses to approximate
the camera lens view.
EXIF metadata: See metadata.
file format: A way of storing image data in a file. Popular image formats
include TIFF and JPEG.
flash EV compensation: A feature that enables the photographer to adjust
the strength of the camera flash.
FlashPix: A file format used by some earlier models of digital cameras; now
supported by only a handful of software programs.
f-number, f-stop: Refers to the size of the camera aperture. A higher number
indicates a smaller aperture. Written as f/2, f/8, and so on.
gamut: Say it gamm-ut. The range of colors that a monitor, printer, or other
device can produce. Colors that a device can’t create are said to be out of
gamut.
Gaussian blur: A type of blur filter available in many photo-editing programs;
named after a famous mathematician.
GIF: Short for graphics interchange format. A file format often used for Web
graphics; not suitable for photos because it can’t handle more than 256
colors.

Digital Photography For Dummies, 5th Edition 
gigabyte: Approximately 1,000 megabytes, or 1 billion bytes. In other words,
a really big collection of bytes. Abbreviated as GB.
grayscale: An image consisting solely of shades of gray, from white to black.
histogram: A graph that maps out brightness values in a digital image; usu-
ally found inside exposure-correction filter dialog boxes.
HSB: A color model based on hue (color), saturation (purity or intensity of
color), and brightness.
HSL: A variation of HSB, this color model is based on hue, saturation, and
lightness.
ISO: Traditionally, a measure of film speed; the higher the number, the faster
the film. On a digital camera, raising the ISO allows faster shutter speed,
smaller aperture, or both, but also can result in a grainy image.
jaggies: Refers to the jagged, stair-stepped appearance of curved and diago-
nal lines in low-resolution photos that are printed at large sizes.
JPEG: Pronounced jay-peg. The primary file format used by digital cameras;
also the leading format for online and Web pictures. Uses lossy compression,
which sometimes damages image quality.
JPEG 2000: An updated version of the JPEG format; not yet fully supported
by all Web browsers or other computer programs.
Kelvin: A scale for measuring the color temperature of light. Sometimes
abbreviated as K, as in 5000K. (But in computerland, the initial K more often
refers to kilobytes, as described next.)
kilobyte: One thousand bytes. Abbreviated as K, as in 64K.
LCD: Stands for liquid crystal display. Often used to refer to the display screen
included on most digital cameras.
lossless compression: A file-compression scheme that doesn’t sacrifice any
vital image data in the compression process. Lossless compression tosses
only redundant data, so image quality is unaffected.
lossy compression: A compression scheme that eliminates important image
data in the name of achieving smaller file sizes. High amounts of lossy com-
pression reduce image quality.
marquee: The dotted outline that results when you select a portion of your
image; sometimes referred to as marching ants.

megabyte: One million bytes. Abbreviated as MB. See bit.
megapixel: One million pixels.
Memory Stick: A memory card used by most Sony digital cameras and
peripheral devices. About the size of a stick of chewing gum.
metadata: Extra data that gets stored along with the primary image data in an
image file. Metadata often includes information such as aperture, shutter
speed, and EV setting used to capture the picture, and can be viewed using
special software. Often referred to as EXIF metadata; EXIF stands for
Exchangeable Image File Format.
metering mode: Refers to the way a camera’s autoexposure mechanism
reads the light in a scene. Common modes include spot metering, which
bases exposure on light in the center of the frame only; center-weighted
metering, which reads the entire scene but gives more emphasis to the sub-
ject in the center of the frame; and matrix, pattern, or multizone metering,
which calculates exposure based on the entire frame.
MultiMediaCard: A type of memory card used by some digital cameras.
noise: Graininess in an image, caused by too little light, a too high ISO setting,
or a defect in the electrical signal generated during the image-capture
process.
NTSC: A video format used by televisions and VCRs in North America. Many
digital cameras can send picture signals to a TV or VCR in this format.
optical zoom: A traditional zoom lens; has the effect of bringing the subject
closer and shortening depth of field. 
output resolution: The number of pixels per linear inch (ppi) in a printed
photo; the user sets this value inside a photo-editing program.
PAL: The video format common in Europe and several other countries. Some
digital cameras sold in North America can output pictures in this video
format (see also NTSC).
PCMCIA Card: A type of removable memory card used in some digital cam-
eras. Now often referred to simply as PC Cards. (PCMCIA stands for Personal
Computer Memory Card International Association.)
PictBridge: A universal standard that allows digital cameras and photo print-
ers to connect directly by USB cable, without the computer serving as a mid-
dleman. Any PictBridge camera can connect to any PictBridge printer,
regardless of whether both are made by the same manufacturer.

pixel: Short for picture element. The basic building block of every image.
platform: A fancy way of saying “type of computer operating system.” Most
folks work either on the Windows platform or the Macintosh platform.
plug-in: A small program or utility that runs within another, larger program.
Many special-effects filters operate as plug-ins to major photo-editing pro-
grams such as Adobe Photoshop Elements.
ppi: Stands for pixels per inch. Used to state image output (print) resolution.
Measured in terms of the number of pixels per linear inch. A higher ppi usu-
ally translates to better-looking printed images.
Raw: See Camera Raw.
Raw converter: A software utility that translates Camera Raw files into a
standard format that photo-editing programs can read. Required to open or
edit Raw files.
resampling: Adding or deleting image pixels. A large amount of resampling
degrades images.
resolution: A term used to describe the capabilities of digital cameras, scan-
ners, printers, and monitors; means different things depending on the device.
(See Chapter 2 for details.)
RGB: The standard color model for digital images; all colors are created by
mixing red, green, and blue light.
SD Card: A type of memory card used in many digital cameras; stands for
Secure Digital.
sharpening: Applying an image-correction filter inside a photo editor to
create the appearance of sharper focus.
shutter: The device in a camera that opens and shuts to allow light into the
camera.
shutter-priority autoexposure: A semi-automatic exposure mode in which
the photographer sets the shutter speed and the camera selects the appro-
priate aperture.
shutter speed: The length of time that the camera shutter remains open,
thereby allowing light to enter the camera and expose the photograph.
slow-sync flash: A special flash setting that allows (or forces) a slower shut-
ter speed than is typical for the normal flash setting. Results in a brighter
background than normal flash.

SmartMedia: A thin, matchbook-sized, removable memory card used in some
digital cameras.
TIFF: Pronounced tiff, as in a little quarrel. Stands for tagged image file format.
A popular image format supported by most Macintosh and Windows 
programs.
TWAIN: Say it twain, as in “never the twain shall meet.” A special software
interface that enables image-editing programs to access images captured by
digital cameras and scanners.
unsharp masking: The process of using the Unsharp Mask filter, found in
many image-editing programs, to create the appearance of a more focused
image. The same thing as sharpening an image, only more impressive 
sounding.
uploading: The same as downloading; the process of transferring data
between two computer devices.
USB: Stands for Universal Serial Bus. A type of port now included on most
computers. Most digital cameras come with a USB cable for connecting the
camera to this port.
white balancing: Adjusting the camera to compensate for the type of light
hitting the photographic subject. Eliminates unwanted color casts produced
by some light sources, such as fluorescent office lighting.
