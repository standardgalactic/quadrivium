CHAPTER 1
Isometries in 2 dimensions
1. Some 2-dimensional vector geometry
We will denote a point in the plane by a letter such as P. The distance between points P
and Q will be denoted |PQ| = |QP|. The (undirected) line segment joining P and Q will be
denoted PQ, while the directed line segment joining P and Q will be denoted −−→
PQ (this is a
vector). Of course,
−−→
QP = −−−→
PQ.
The origin O will be taken as the centre of a coordinate system based on the x and y-axes
in the usual way. Given a point P, the position vector of P is the vector p = −−→
OP which we
think of as joining O to P. Similarly denoting the position vector of Q by q = −−→
OQ, we have the
diagram

from which we see that p + −−→
PQ = q, and hence
(1.2)
−−→
PQ = q −p.
Each position vector p can be expressed in terms of its x and y coordinates p1, p2 and we
will often write p = (p1, p2) or p = (xP , yP ). Then using this notation, Equation (1.2) expands
to
−−→
PQ = (q1 −p1, q2 −p2) = (xQ −xP , yQ −yP ).
We will denote the set of all vectors (x, y) by R2, so
R2 = {(x, y) : x, y ∈R}.
This set will be identiﬁed with the plane by the correspondence
(x, y) ←→the point with position vector (x, y).
The distance between two points P and Q can be found using the formula
|PQ| = length of −−→
PQ
= length of (q −p)
=
p
(q1 −p1)2 + (q2 −p2)2.
In particular, the length of the vector p = −−→

To ﬁnd the angle θ between two non-zero vectors u = (u1, u2) and v = (v1, v2) we can make
use of the dot or scalar product which is deﬁned to be
(1.4)
u · v = (u1, u2) · (v1, v2) = u1v1 + u2v2.

Notice that
|u|2 = u · u,
|v|2 = v · v.
Then
θ = cos−1 u · v
|u| |v|.

The vectors u and v are perpendicular, normal or orthogonal if u · v = 0 or equivalently if the
angle between them is π/2.
If A, B, C are three distinct points then the angle between the lines AB and AC is given by
∠BAC = cos−1
−−→
AB · −→
AC
|AB| |AC|.
The lines AB and AC are perpendicular, normal or orthogonal if ∠BAC = π/2.
A line L can be speciﬁed in several diﬀerent ways.
First by using an implicit equation
ax + by = c with (a, b) ̸= (0, 0); this gives
(1.5a)
L = {(x, y) ∈R2 : ax + by = c}.
It is worth remarking that the vector (a, b) is perpendicular to L. An alternative way to write
the implicit equation is as (a, b) · (x, y) = c, so we also have
(1.5b)
L = {x ∈R2 : (a, b) · x = c}.
To determine c it suﬃces to know any point x0 on L, then c = (a, b) · x0.
Second, if we have a vector u parallel to L (and so perpendicular to (a, b)) then we can use
the parametric equation x = tu + x0, where t ∈R and x0 is some point on L. It is usual to
take u to be a unit vector, i.e., |u| = 1. Then
(1.5c)
L = {tu + x0 ∈R2 : t ∈R}.
It is also useful to recall the idea of projecting a non-zero vector v onto another w. To do
this, we make use of the unit vector
ˆw =
1
|w|w = w
|w|.
Then the component of v in the w-direction, or the projection of v onto w is the vector
vw = (v · ˆw) ˆw =
µv · w

Then vw is parallel to w and
(v −vw) · w = 0,
so the vector (v −vw) is perpendicular to w.
We can also project a point P with position vector p onto a line L which does not contain
P. To do this, we consider the line L′ passing through P and perpendicular to L,
L′ = {su′ + p : s ∈R},
where u′ is any non-zero vector perpendicular to L (for example (a, b) or the unit vector in the
same direction). Then the projection of P onto L is the point of intersection of L and L′, whose
position vector p′ = s′u′ + p can be determined by solving the following equation for s′:
(a, b) · (s′u′ + p) = c.

2. ISOMETRIES OF THE PLANE

2. Isometries of the plane
Definition 1.1. An isometry of the plane is a distance preserving function F : R2 −→R2.
Here, distance preserving means that for points P and Q with position vectors p and q,
|F(P)F(Q)| = |PQ|,
i.e.,
|F(p) −F(q)| = |p −q|.
Before considering examples, we note the following important fact.
Proposition 1.2. Let F : R2 −→R2 be an isometry which ﬁxes the origin. Then F pre-
serves scalar products and angles between vectors.
Proof. Let u, v be vectors and let U, V be the points with these as position vectors. Let
F(U) and F(V ) have position vectors u′ = −−−−→
OF(U) and v′ = −−−−→
OF(V ). For every pair of points
P, Q we have |F(P)F(Q)| = |PQ|, so
|u′ −v′|2 = |F(U)F(V )|2 = |UV |2 = |u −v|2,
hence
|u′|2 + |v′|2 −2u′ · v′ = |u|2 + |v|2 −2u · v.
Since
|u′| = |OF(U)| = |F(O)F(U)| = |OU| = |u|,
|v′| = |OF(V )| = |F(O)F(V )| = |OV | = |v|,
we obtain
u′ · v′ = u · v,
which shows that the scalar product of two position vectors is unchanged by an isometry which
ﬁxes the origin. Similarly, angles are preserved since the angle between the vectors u′, v′ is
cos−1 u′ · v′
|u′| |v′| = cos−1 u · v
|u| |v|.
□
Corollary 1.3. An isometry F : R2 −→R2 preserves angles between lines.
Proof. Consider the isometry F0 : R2 −→R2 for which F0(P) has the position vector
−−−−−→
OF0(P) = −−−−→
OF(P) −−−−−→
OF(O).
Then F0(O) = O. For any two points A, B we have
−−−−−−−→
F(A)F(B) = −−−−−−−−→
F0(A)F0(B)
and the result follows from Proposition 1.2.
□
Types of isometries. There are three basic types of isometries of the plane, translations,
reﬂections, rotations. A fourth type, glide reﬂections, are built up as compositions of reﬂections
and translations.
Translations. Let t ∈R2. Then translation by t is the function
Transt : R2 −→R2;
Transt(x) = x + t.

Notice that
| Transt(x) −Transt(y)| = |(x + t) −(y + t)| = |x −y|,
so Transt is an isometry. If Transs is a second such translation function, we have
Transt ◦Transs(x) = Transt(x + s) = x + s + t = Transs+t(x),

4
1. ISOMETRIES IN 2 DIMENSIONS
so
(1.6)
Transt ◦Transs = Transs+t .
Since s + t = t + s, we also have
(1.7)
Transs ◦Transt = Transt ◦Transs .
So translations behave well with respect to composition. We also have
Trans0 = IdR2,
Trans−1
t
= Trans−t .
Notice that when t ̸= 0, every point in the plane is moved by Transt, so such a transformation
has no ﬁxed points.
Reﬂections. The next type of isometry is a reﬂection in a line L. Recall that a line in the
plane has the form
L = {(x, y) ∈R2 : ax + by = c},
where a, b, c ∈R with at least one of a and b non-zero. The reﬂection in L is the function
ReﬂL : R2 −→R2
which sends every point on L to itself and if P lies on a line L′ perpendicular to L and intersecting
it at M say, then ReﬂL(P) also lies on L′ and satisﬁes |M ReﬂL(P)| = |MP|.

ReﬂL(P)

This is equivalent to saying that if P and M have position vectors p and m, then
ReﬂL(p) −p = 2(m −p)
or
(1.8)
ReﬂL(p) = 2m −p,
where ReﬂL(p) −p is perpendicular to L.
In order to determine the eﬀect of a reﬂection, recall that the vector (a, b) is perpendicular
to L. Consider the unit vector
u =
1
√
a2 + b2 (a, b).
Then we can ﬁnd the point M as follows. L′ is the line given in parametric form by
x = tu + p
(t ∈R),
and M is point on both L and L′. So m = su + p, say, satisﬁes the linear equation in the
unknown s,
u · m =
c
√
a2 + b2 .
This expands to give
s + u · p =
c
√
a2 + b2 .
Thus we have
(1.9)

Substituting into Equation (1.8) we obtain
(1.10)

¶
u + p.
Performing a reﬂection twice gives the identity transformation,
(1.11)
(ReﬂL)2 = ReﬂL ◦ReﬂL = IdR2 .
Notice that points on the line L are ﬁxed by ReﬂL, while all other points are moved.
Example 1.4. Determine the eﬀect of the reﬂection ReﬂL, on the points P(1, 0), where
L = {(x, y) : x −y = 0}.
Solution. Notice that the unit vector
u =
1
√
2(1, −1)
is perpendicular to L. Using this, we resolve p = (1, 0) into its components perpendicular and
parallel to L. These are the vectors
p′ = ((1, 0) · u)u =
1
√
2u,
p′′ = (1, 0) −1
√
2u = (1, 0) −1
2(1, −1) = 1
2(1, 1).
Then we have
ReﬂL(p) = −p′ + p′′ = 1
2(−1, 1) + 1
2(1, 1) = (0, 1).
□
Example 1.5. If θ ∈[0, π) and
Lθ = {(t cos θ, t sin θ) : t ∈R},
ﬁnd a formula for the eﬀect of ReﬂLθ on P(x, y) ̸= (0, 0).
Solution. The line Lθ contains the origin O and the point U(cos θ, sin θ). Also if X(1, 0) is
the point on the x-axis, then ∠XOU = θ. If ∠XOP = α, then on setting r = |OP| =
p
x2 + y2
we have
x = r cos α,
y = r sin α.
If P ′ = ReﬂLθ(P), with position vector (x′, y′), we have
∠XOP ′ = θ −(α −θ) = 2θ −α,
hence
x′ = r cos(2θ −α),
y′ = r sin(2θ −α).
Recall that
cos(α + θ) = cos α cos θ −sin α sin θ,
sin(α + θ) = cos α sin θ + sin α cos θ.
Using these we obtain
x′ = r(cos 2θ cos α + sin 2θ sin α),
y′ = r(sin 2θ cos α −cos 2θ sin α),
which yield
x′ = cos 2θ x + sin 2θ y,
(1.12a)
y′ = sin 2θ x −cos 2θ y.
(1.12b)
So applying ReﬂLθ to P we obtain the point
X′(cos 2θ x + sin 2θ y, sin 2θ x −cos 2θ y).
□
We can also describe the composition of two reﬂections in two distinct parallel lines.
Proposition 1.6. Let L1 and L2 be distinct parallel lines.
Then the two compositions
ReﬂL1 ◦ReﬂL2 and ReﬂL2 ◦ReﬂL1 are translations.

6
1. ISOMETRIES IN 2 DIMENSIONS
Proof. Let p be the position vector of a point on L1 and let v be a vector perpendicular
to L1 and chosen so that q = p + v is the position vector of a point Q on L2. Clearly v is
independent of which point P on L1 we start with.
•

Then for any t ∈R,
ReﬂL1 ◦ReﬂL2(p + tv) = ReﬂL1 ◦ReﬂL2(q + (t −1)v)
= ReﬂL1(q + (1 −t)v)
= ReﬂL1(p + (2 −t)v)
= p + (t −2)v
= (p + tv) −2v.
So
ReﬂL1 ◦ReﬂL2 = Trans−2v .
Similarly we obtain
ReﬂL2 ◦ReﬂL1 = Trans2v .
□
Rotations. Let C be a point with position vector c. Then RotC,θ : R2 −→R2 is the rotation
of the plane around C anti-clockwise through the angle θ (measured in radians and taking the
anti-clockwise direction to be positive).

Notice that C is ﬁxed by RotC,θ but unless θ = 2πk for some k ∈Z, no other point is ﬁxed.
For k ∈Z,
RotC,2πk = IdR2,
RotC,θ+2πk = RotC,θ .
Example 1.7. Find a formula for the eﬀect of the RotO,θ on the point P(x, y).
Solution. We assume that P ̸= O since the origin is ﬁxed by this rotation. Recall that if
X(1, 0) is the point on the x-axis and ∠XOP = α, then setting r = |OP| =
p
x2 + y2 we have
x = r cos α,
y = r sin α.
If P ′ = RotO,θ(P), with position vector (x′, y′), we have
x′ = r cos(α + θ),
y′ = r sin(α + θ).
Using the equations of (1.12) we obtain
□
(1.13)
RotO,θ(x, y) = (cos θ x −sin θ y, sin θ x + cos θ y).

Glide reﬂections. The composition of a reﬂection ReﬂL and a translation Transt parallel
to the line of reﬂection L (in either possible order) is called a glide reﬂection. We will study
these in detail later. If the translation is not by 0 then such a glide reﬂection has no ﬁxed
points.

Composing isometries. We now record a useful fact about isometries that we have already
seen for translations.
Proposition 1.8. Let F, G: R2 −→R2 be two isometries.
Then the two compositions
F ◦G, G ◦F : R2 −→R2 are isometries which are not necessarily equal.
Proof. For any two points P, Q we have
|F ◦G(P)F ◦G(Q)| = |F(G(P))F(G(Q))| = |G(P)G(Q)| = |PQ|,
|G ◦F(P)G ◦F(Q)| = |G(F(P))G(F(Q))| = |F(P)F(Q)| = |PQ|,
hence F ◦G and G◦F are isometries. The non-commutativity will be illustrated in examples.
□
We also record a somewhat less obvious fact that will be proved in the next section.
Proposition 1.9. Let F : R2 −→R2 be an isometry. Then F has an inverse which is also
an isometry.
Proof. See Corollary 1.12 below for a proof that an isometry is invertible. Assuming that
F −1 exists, notice that for x ∈R2,
|F −1(x)| = |F(F −1(x))| = |x)|,
hence F −1 is an isometry.
□
3. Matrices and isometries
Consider an isometry T : R2 −→R2 which ﬁxes the origin O, i.e., T(O) = O.
Suppose that X(1, 0) is sent to X′(cos θ, sin θ) by T. Then Y (0, 1) must be sent to one of
the two points Y ′(cos(θ + π/2), sin(θ + π/2)) and Y ′′(cos(θ −π/2), sin(θ −π/2)) since these are
the only ones at unit distance from O making the angle π/2 with OX′.

If P(x, y), then writing
x = r cos α,
y = r sin α,

1. ISOMETRIES IN 2 DIMENSIONS
where r =
p
x2 + y2 = |OP|, we ﬁnd that the point P ′(x′, y′) with P ′ = T(P) has
x′ = r cos α′,
y′ = r sin α′,
for some α′ since |OP ′| = |OP| = r.
If T(Y ) = Y ′, then we must have α′ = α + θ, while if T(Y ) = Y ′′, we must have α′ = θ −α.
This means that
(x′, y′) =
(
r(cos(α + θ), sin(α + θ))
if T(Y ) = Y ′,
r(cos(θ −α), sin(θ −α))
if T(Y ) = Y ′′,
=
(
(cos θ x −sin θ y, sin θ x + cos θ y)
if T(Y ) = Y ′,
(cos θ x + sin θ y, sin θ x −cos θ y)
if T(Y ) = Y ′′.
The ﬁrst case corresponds a rotation about the origin O through angle θ, while the second
corresponds to a reﬂection in the line
sin(θ/2)x −cos(θ/2)y = 0.
through the origin. Notice that in either case, T is a linear transformation or linear mapping
in that
T((x1, y1) + (x2, y2)) = T(x1, y1) + T(x2, y2),
(1.14a)
T(t(x, y)) = T(tx, ty) = tT(x, y).
(1.14b)
From now on, we will identify (x, y) with the column vector
·
x
y
¸
. This allows us to represent
T by a matrix. Notice that

So in each case we have T(x) = Ax for a suitable matrix A provided that we interpret a vector
(x, y) as a 2 × 1 matrix.

so they are both orthogonal matrices in the sense of the following deﬁnition.
Definition 1.10. An n × n matrix A is orthogonal if AT A = In or equivalently if A is
invertible with inverse A−1 = AT .
It is easy to see that every n × n orthogonal matrix A has det A = ±1. For the above

It is also true that every 2 × 2 orthogonal matrix is of one or other of these two forms.
For a general isometry F : R2 −→R2, on setting t = F(0) we can form the isometry
F0 = Trans−t ◦F : R2 −→R2 which ﬁxes the origin and satisﬁes
F = Transt ◦F0.
Combining all of these ingredients we obtain

3. MATRICES AND ISOMETRIES

Theorem 1.11. Every isometry F : R2 −→R2 can be expressed as a composition
F = Transt ◦F0,
where F0 : R2 −→R2 is an isometry that ﬁxes O, hence there is an orthogonal matrix [F0] for
which
F(x) = [F0]x + t
(x ∈R2).
Corollary 1.12. Every isometry F : R2 −→R2 is invertible.
Proof. Express F in matrix form,
F(x) = [F0]x + t,
where [F0] is orthogonal and so has an inverse given by [F0]−1 = [F0]T . Then the function
G: R2 −→R2 given by
G(x) = [F0]−1(x −t) = [F0]−1x −[F0]−1t
satisﬁes
G ◦F = IdR2 = F ◦G,
and so is the inverse of F. Therefore it is also an isometry (see the ‘proof’ of Proposition 1.9).
□
Given an isometry F : R2 −→R2, we can express it in the form
F(x) = Ax + t,
for some orthogonal matrix A, and then use the Seitz symbol (A | t) to describe it. We will use
this notation freely from now on and often write
(A | t)x = Ax + t = F(x).
For the composition we will write
(A1 | t1)(A2 | t2) = (A1 | t1) ◦(A2 | t2).
Proposition 1.13. Suppose (A | s) and (B | t) represent the same isometry R2 −→R2.
Then B = A and t = s.
Proof. Since the functions (A | s) and (B | t) agree on every point, evaluating at any
x ∈R2 gives
Ax + s = Bx + t.
In particular, taking x = 0 we obtain s = t. In general this gives
Ax = Bx.
Now choosing x = e1, e2, the standard basis vectors, we obtain A = B since Aei, Bei are the
i-th columns of A, B.

What happens when we compose two Seitz symbols or ﬁnd the symbol of inverse function?
Proposition 1.14. We have the following algebraic rules for Seitz symbols of isometries.
(A1 | t1)(A2 | t2) = (A1A2 | t1 + A1t2),
(A | t)−1 = (A−1 | −A−1t) = (AT | −AT t).
Proof. The formula for the inverse was demonstrated earlier. For any x ∈R2,
(A1 | t1)(A2 | t2)x = (A1 | t1)(A2x + t2)
= A1(A2x + t2) + t1
= A1A2x + A1t2 + t1
= (A1A2 | t1 + A1t2)x.

We can now classify isometries of the plane in terms of their Seitz symbols. We will denote
the 2 × 2 identity matrix by I = I2.

1. ISOMETRIES IN 2 DIMENSIONS
Translations. These have the form (I | t). To compose two of them, we have the formula
(I | t1)(I | t2) = (I | t1 + t2).
Rotations. Consider a Seitz symbol (A | t) where A is orthogonal with det A = 1, hence
it has the form
A =
·
cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ
¸
.
The equation Ax + t = x is solvable if and only if (I −A)x = t can be solved. Now
det(I −A) = det
·
1 −cos θ
sin θ
−sin θ
1 −cos θ
¸
= (1 −cos θ)2 + sin2 θ
= 1 −2 cos θ + cos2 θ + sin2 θ
= 2 −2 cos θ = 2(1 −cos θ),
so provided that cos θ ̸= 1, (I −A) is invertible. But cos θ = 1 if and only if A ̸= I, so (I −A)
is invertible if and only if A ̸= I.
So as long as A ̸= I, we can ﬁnd a vector c = (I −A)−1t for which (A | t)c = c. Then
(A | t) represents rotation about c through the angle θ. Notice that once we know A and c we
can recover t using the formula t = (I −A)c.
If A = I, (I | 0) is a rotation through angle 0, while if t ̸= 0, (I | t) is not a rotation.
Remark 1.15. When working with rotations it is useful to recall the following formula for
ﬁnding the inverse of a 2 × 2 matrix which is valid provided ad −bc ̸= 0:

Glide reﬂections. Consider a Seitz symbol (A | t) where A is orthogonal with det A = −1,
hence it has the form
A =
·
cos θ
sin θ
sin θ
−cos θ
¸
.
Recall that this matrix represents ReﬂLθ/2, reﬂection in the line through the origin
Lθ/2 = {(x, y) ∈R2 : sin(θ/2)x −cos(θ/2)y = 0}.
We will see that (A | t) represents a glide reﬂection, i.e., the composition of a reﬂection in a
line parallel to Lθ/2 and a translation by a vector parallel to Lθ/2.
Express t in the form t = u+2v, where v is perpendicular to the line Lθ/2 and u is parallel
to it. To do this we may take the unit vectors
w∥= (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)),
w⊥= (sin(θ/2), −cos(θ/2))

3. MATRICES AND ISOMETRIES
11
which are parallel and perpendicular respectively to Lθ/2 and ﬁnd the projections of t onto these
unit vectors; then we have
u = tw∥,
v = 1
2tw⊥.
Now from the proof of Proposition 1.6 we know that if L is the line parallel to Lθ/2 containing
v, then
ReﬂL = Trans2v ◦ReﬂLθ/2,
and so
Transu ◦ReﬂL = Transu ◦Trans2v ◦ReﬂLθ/2
= Transu+2v ◦ReﬂLθ/2
= Transt ◦ReﬂLθ/2
= (A | t).
This shows that (A | t) represents reﬂection in L followed by translation by u parallel to L; we
allow u = 0 here, so a reﬂection can be interpreted as a special kind of glide reﬂection.
Remark 1.16. Here is another way to ﬁnd the vectors u and v in the above situation.
Notice that since u is parallel to Lθ/2 and v is perpendicular to it,
(A | 0)t = A(u + 2v) = Au + 2Av = u −2v.
Hence we have
u = 1
2 (t + At) ,
v = 1
4 (t −At) .
Summary of Seitz symbols

t = (I −A)c,
c = (I −A)−1t.
Glide reﬂections:
Transu ◦Trans2v ◦ReﬂLθ/2 = (A | t), where
A =

v is perpendicular to the line
Lθ/2 = {(x, y) ∈R2 : sin(θ/2)x −cos(θ/2)y = 0},
and u is parallel to it. This represents a glide reﬂection in the line parallel to Lθ/2
and containing the point with position vector v; the translation is by u. When
u = 0, this is a reﬂection.
Some examples. Using Seitz symbols and matrix algebra, compositions of isometries can
be calculated eﬀectively as illustrated in the following examples.
Example 1.17. Compose the rotation through 2π/3 about (1/2,

the line x = y in the two possible orders and give geometric interpretations of the results.

These matrices represent reﬂections in the lines
L1 : x sin(−5π/12) −y cos(−5π/12) = 0,
L2 : x sin(π/12) + y cos(π/12) = 0.
Now we need to resolve t = (1, 0) in parallel and normal directions with respect to the line
L1. The vector (sin(−5π/12), −cos(−5π/12)) is a unit vector normal to L1, so we can take
v1 = 1

We need to resolve Bt = (0, 1) in parallel and normal directions with respect to the line L2.
The vector (sin(π/12), cos(π/12)) is a unit vector normal to L2, so we can take
v2 = 1
2((sin(π/12), cos(π/12)) · (0, 1))(sin(π/12), cos(π/12))

So (BA | Bt) represents reﬂection in the line

followed by translation by the vector u2 = 1
4(−1, 2 −

Example 1.18. If (A1 | t1) and (A2 | t2) are glide reﬂections, show that their composition
(A1 | t1)(A2 | t2) is a rotation or a translation.
Solution. We have
det A1 = −1 = det A2,
det(A1A2) = det A1 det A2 = 1,
(A1 | t1)(A2 | t2) = (A1A2 | t1 + A1t2).
When A1A2 = I, the composition (A1 | t1)(A2 | t2) is a translation (or a trivial rotation if
t1 + A1t2 = 0). When A1A2 ̸= I, (A1 | t1)(A2 | t2) is a rotation.

we see that (A | 0) represents reﬂection in the line
L = {(x, y) : sin(π/8) x −cos(π/8) y = 0}.
Write t = u + 2v where u is parallel to L and v is perpendicular to L. Then the vectors
(sin(π/8), −cos(π/8)) and (cos(π/8), sin(π/8)) are unit vectors in these directions and
(sin(π/8), −cos(π/8)) · t = sin(π/8),

(sin2(π/8) + cos2(π/8)) = sin(π/8)
2
,
we see that (A | t) is a glide reﬂection consisting of reﬂection in the line
L′ = {(x, y) : sin(π/8) x −cos(π/8) y = sin(π/8)/2},
which parallel to L and contains v. Noting that
B =

we see that (B | 0) represents reﬂection in the line

CHAPTER 2
Groups and symmetry
1. Groups and subgroups
Let G be set and ∗a binary operation which combines each pair of elements x, y ∈G to give
another element x ∗y ∈G. Then (G, ∗) is a group if it satisﬁes the following conditions.
Gp1: for all elements x, y, z ∈G, (x ∗y) ∗z = x ∗(y ∗z);
Gp2: there is an element ι ∈G such that for every x ∈G, ι ∗x = x = x ∗ι;
Gp3: for every x ∈G, there is a unique element y ∈G such that x ∗y = ι = y ∗x.
Gp1 is usually called the associativity law. ι is usually called the identity element of (G, ∗). In
Gp3, the unique element y associated to x is called the inverse of x and denoted x−1.
Example 2.1. For each of the following cases, (G, ∗) is a group.
(1) G = Z, ∗= +, ι = 0 and x−1 = −x.
(2) G = Q, ∗= +, ι = 0 and x−1 = −x.
(3) G = R, ∗= +, ι = 0 and x−1 = −x.

Example 2.3. Let X be a ﬁnite set and let Perm(X) be the set of all bijections f : X −→X
(also known as permutations). Then (Perm(X), ◦) is a group where
◦= composition of functions,
ι = IdX = the identity function on X,
f−1 = the inverse function of f.
(Perm(X), ◦) is called the permutation group of X. We will study these and other examples
in more detail.
When discussing a group (G, ∗), we will often write xy for the product x ∗y if no confusion
seems likely to arise. For example, when dealing with a permutation group (Perm(X), ◦) we
will write αβ for α ◦β.
Example 2.4. Let
Euc(2) = set of all isometries R2 −→R2,
∗= ◦,
ι = (I2 | 0).
Then (Euc(2), ◦) is a group known as the Euclidean group of R2.

2. GROUPS AND SYMMETRY
If a group (G, ∗) has a ﬁnite underlying set G, then the number of elements in the G is
called the order of G and is denoted |G|. If |G| is not ﬁnite, G is said to be inﬁnite.
A group G is commutative or abelian if for every pair of elements x, y ∈G, x ∗y = y ∗x.
Most groups are not commutative.
Let (G, ∗) be a group and H ⊆G a subset. Then H is a subgroup of G if (H, ∗) is a group.
In detail this means
• for x, y ∈H, x ∗y ∈H;
• ι ∈H;
• if z ∈H then z−1 ∈H.
We don’t need to check associativity since Gp1 holds for all elements of G and so in particular
for elements of H.
We write H ⩽G whenever H is a subgroup of G and H < G if H ̸= G, i.e., H is a proper
subgroup of G.
If (G, ∗) is a group, then for any g ∈G we can consider the subset
⟨g⟩= {gn : n ∈Z} ⊆G,
where
gn =







n factors
z
}|
{
g ∗g ∗· · · ∗g
if n > 0,
(g−1)−n
if n < 0,
ι
if n = 0.
It is easy to see that ⟨g⟩⩽G, and it is known as the cyclic subgroup generated by g. If for some
c ∈G we have G = ⟨c⟩then G is called a cyclic group.
For g ∈G, if there is an n > 0 such that gn = ι then g is said to have ﬁnite order, otherwise
g has inﬁnite order.
Proposition 2.5. Let (G, ∗) be a group and g ∈G.
a) If g has inﬁnite order then all the integer powers of g are distinct and so G is inﬁnite. In
particular,
⟨g⟩= {. . . , g−2, g−1, ι, g1, g2, . . .}.
b) If g has ﬁnite order then there is a smallest positive exponent n0 for which gn0 = ι and the
distinct powers of g are g, g2, . . . , gn0−1, gn0 = ι, so
⟨g⟩= {g, g2, . . . , gn0−1, ι}.
If g has ﬁnite order the number n0 is called the order of g, and is denoted |g|. Sometimes
we write |g| = ∞if g has inﬁnite order and |g| < ∞when it has ﬁnite order.
2. Permutation groups
We will follow the ideas of Example 2.3 and consider the standard set with n elements
n = {1, 2, . . . , n}.
If we write Sn = Perm(n), the group (Sn, ◦) is called the symmetric group on n objects or the
symmetric group of degree n or the permutation group on n objects.
Theorem 2.6. Sn has order |Sn| = n!.
Proof. Deﬁning an element σ ∈Sn is equivalent to specifying the list
σ(1), σ(2), . . . , σ(n)
consisting of the n numbers 1, 2, . . . , n taken in some order with no repetitions. To do this we
have
• n choices for σ(1),
• n −1 choices for σ(2) (taken from the remaining n −1 elements),
• and so on.

2. PERMUTATION GROUPS

In all, this gives n × (n −1) × · · · × 2 × 1 = n! choices for σ, so |Sn| = n! as claimed. We will
often use the notation

Let X be a set with exactly n elements which we list in some order, x1, x2, . . . , xn. Then
there is an action of Sn on X given by
σ · xk = xσ(k)
(σ ∈Sn, k = 1, 2, . . . , n).
For example, if X = {A, B, C} we can take x1 = A, x2 = B, x3 = C and so

Often it is useful to display the eﬀect of a permutation σ: X −→X by indicating where
each element is sent by σ with the aid of arrows. To do this we display the elements of X in
two similar rows with an arrow joining xi in the ﬁrst row to σ(xi) in the second. For example,
the action of the permutation σ =

2. GROUPS AND SYMMETRY
Let σ ∈Sn and consider the arrow diagram of σ as above. Let cσ be the number of crossings
of arrows. The sign of σ is the number
sgn σ = (−1)cσ =
(
+1
if cσ is even,
−1
if cσ is odd.
Then sgn: Sn −→{+1, −1}. Notice that {+1, −1} is a group under multiplication.
Proposition 2.8. The function sgn: Sn −→{+1, −1} satisﬁes
sgn(τσ) = sgn(τ) sgn(σ)
(τ, σ ∈Sn).
Proof. By considering the arrow diagram for τσ obtained by joining the diagrams for σ
and τ, we see that the total number of crossings is cσ + cτ. If we straighten out the paths
starting at each number in the top row, so that we change the total number of crossings by 2
each time, hence (−1)cσ+cτ = (−1)cτσ.
□
A permutation σ is called even if sgn σ = 1, otherwise it is odd.
The set of all even
permutations in Sn is denoted by An. Notice that ι ∈An and in fact the following result is true.
Proposition 2.9. The set An is a subgroup of Sn, An ⩽Sn.
Proof. By Proposition 2.8, for σ, τ ∈An,
sgn(τσ) = sgn(τ) sgn(σ) = 1.
Note also that ι ∈An.
The arrow diagram for σ−1 is obtained from that for σ by interchanging the rows and
reversing all the arrows, so sgn σ−1 = sgn σ. Thus if σ ∈An, we have sgn σ−1 = 1.
Hence, An is a subgroup of Sn.
□
An is called the n-th alternating group.

Proposition 2.11. For n ⩾2, An has order |An| = |Sn|/2 = n!/2.
Proof. Let σ ∈Sn and let τ ∈Sn be the permutation which has the eﬀect
τ(j) =





2
if j = 1,
1
if j = 2,
j
otherwise.
Then either σ ∈An or (12)σ ∈An. Furthermore, if σ′ ∈Sn and (1 2)σ′ = (1 2)σ then σ′ = σ,
so we can write σ ∈Sn uniquely in one of the forms σ ∈An or σ = (1 2)θ with θ ∈∈An. This
shows that |Sn| = 2|An|.
□
Suppose σ ∈Sn. Now carry out the following steps.
• Form the sequence
1 →σ(1) →σ2(1) →· · · →σr1−1(1) →σr1(1) = 1
where σk(j) = σ(σk−1(j)) and r1 is the smallest positive power for which this is true.
• Take the smallest number k2 = 1, 2, . . . , n for which k2 ̸= σt(1) for every t. Form the
sequence
1 →σ(k2) →σ2(k2) →· · · →σr2−1(k2) →σr2(k2) = 1
where r2 is the smallest positive power for which this is true.
• Repeat this with k3 = 1, 2, . . . , n being the smallest number for which k3 ̸= σt(1), σt(k2)
for every t.
• ...

2. PERMUTATION GROUPS
21
Writing k1 = 1, we obtain a collection of disjoint cycles
k1 →σ(k1) →σ2(k1) →· · · →σr1−1(k1) →σr1(k1) = k1
k2 →σ(k2) →σ2(k2) →· · · →σr2−1(k2) →σr2(k2) = k2
...
kd →σ(kd) →σ2(kd) →· · · →σrd−1(kd) →σrd(kd) = kd
in which every number k = 1, 2, . . . , n occurs exactly once.
The s-th one of these cycles can be viewed as corresponding to the permutation of n which
behaves according to the action of σ on the elements that appear as σt(ks) and ﬁx every other
element. We indicate this permutation using the cycle notation
(ks σ(ks) · · · σrs−1(ks)).
Then we have
σ = (k1 σ(k1) · · · σr1−1(k1)) · · · (kd σ(kd) · · · σrd−1(kd)),
which is the disjoint cycle decomposition of σ. It is unique apart from the order of the factors
and the order in which the numbers within each cycle occur.
For example, in S4,
(1 2)(3 4) =(2 1)(4 3) = (3 4)(1 2) = (4 3)(2 1),
(1 2 3)(1) =(3 1 2)(1) = (2 3 1)(1) = (1)(1 2 3) = (1)(3 1 2) = (1)(2 3 1).
We usually leave out cycles of length 1, so for example (1 2 3)(1) = (1 2 3).
A permutation τ ∈Sn which interchanges two elements of n and leaves the rest ﬁxed is
called a transposition.
Proposition 2.12. For σ ∈Sn, there are transpositions τ1, . . . , τk such that σ = τ1 · · · τk.
One way to decompose a permutation σ into transpositions is to ﬁrst decompose it into
disjoint cycles then use the easily checked formula
(2.1)
(i1 i2 . . . ir) = (i1 ir) · · · (i1 i3)(i1 i2).

∈S5
into a product of transpositions.
Solution. We have
σ = (3)(1 2 5 4) = (1 2 5 4) = (1 4)(1 5)(1 2).
Some alternative decompositions are
σ = (2 1)(2 4)(2 5) = (5 2)(5 1)(5 4).
□
Example 2.14. In S6, compose the permutations α = (1 2 3 4) and β = (1 3 5)(2 4).
Solution. We will determine αβ = (1 2 3 4)(1 3 5)(2 4) by building up its cycles.
Beginning with 1, we see that
1
(2 4)
−−−→1
(1 3 5)
−−−−→3
(1 2 3 4)
−−−−−→4,
so αβ(1) = 4. Now repeat this with 4,
4
(2 4)
−−−→2
(1 3 5)
−−−−→2
(1 2 3 4)
−−−−−→3,
so αβ(4) = 3. Repeating with 3 we obtain

(2 4)
−−−→3
(1 3 5)
−−−−→5
(1 2 3 4)
−−−−−→5,

22
2. GROUPS AND SYMMETRY
so αβ(3) = 5. Repeating with 5 we obtain
5
(2 4)
−−−→5
(1 3 5)
−−−−→1
(1 2 3 4)
−−−−−→2,
so αβ(5) = 2. Repeating with 2 we obtain
2
(2 4)
−−−→4
(1 3 5)
−−−−→4
(1 2 3 4)
−−−−−→2,
so αβ(2) = 1. This shows that αβ contains the 5-cycle (1 4 3 5 2),
1 −→4 −→3 −→5 −→2 −→1.
Applying αβ to 6 we ﬁnd that αβ(6) = 6, so αβ also contains the 1-cycle (6). Hence
αβ = (1 4 3 5 2)(6) = (6)(1 4 3 5 2) = (1 4 3 5 2).
Similarly we ﬁnd that
βα = (1 3 5)(2 4)(1 2 3 4) = (1 4 3 2 5).
It is worth noting that βα ̸= αβ, which shows that Sn is not a commutative group in general.
□
3. Groups of isometries
From Example 2.4 we have the Euclidean group (Euc(2), ◦), which is clearly inﬁnite.
Example 2.15. Consider the set of translations in Euc(2),
Trans(2) = {(I2 | t) ∈Euc(2) : t ∈R2}.
Then Trans(2) ⩽Euc(2).
Proof. In Equation (1.6) we have seen that Trans(2) is closed under composition. We also
know that (I2 | 0) ∈Trans(2) and for t ∈R2,
(I2 | t)−1 = (I2 | −t) ∈Trans(2).
So Trans(2) ⩽Euc(2).
□
Trans(2) is called the translation subgroup of Euc(2).
Example 2.16. Let
O(2) = {(A | 0) ∈Euc(2) : A is orthogonal}.
Then O(2) ⩽Euc(2).
Proof. For (A | 0), (B | 0) ∈O(2) we have
(A | 0)(B | 0) = (AB | 0)
and
(AB)T (AB) = (BT AT )(AB) = BT (AT A)B = BT I2B = BT B = I2.
So (A | 0)(B | 0) ∈O(2). Also, (I2 | 0) ∈O(2) and
(A | 0)−1 = (A−1 | 0) ∈O(2)
since A−1 = AT and
(AT )T (AT ) = AAT = AA−1 = I2,
hence A−1 is orthogonal.
□
O(2) is the orthogonal subgroup of Euc(2). It consists of all the isometries of R2 which ﬁx
the origin.
Example 2.17. Let
SO(2) = {(A | 0) ∈Euc(2) : A is orthogonal and det A = 1}.
Then SO(2) ⩽O(2) ⩽Euc(2).

4. SYMMETRY GROUPS OF PLANE FIGURES
23
Proof. If (A | 0), (B | 0) ∈SO(2), then (A | 0)(B | 0) = (AB | 0) and
det(AB) = det A det B = 1,
so (A | 0)(B | 0) ∈SO(2). Checking the remaining points is left as an exercise.
□
SO(2) is called the special orthogonal subgroup of Euc(2) and consists of all rotations about
the origin. Elements of Euc(2) of the form (A | t) with A ∈SO(2) are called direct isometries,
while those with A /∈SO(2) are called indirect isometries.
We denote the subset of direct
isometries by Euc+(2) and the subset of indirect isometries by Euc−(2).
Example 2.18. The direct isometries form a subgroup of Euc(2), i.e., Euc+(2) ⩽Euc(2).
Proof. If (A1 | t1), (A2 | t2) ∈Euc+(2), then
(A1 | t1)(A2 | t2) = (A1A2 | t1 + A1t2)
with A1A2 ∈SO(2), so this product is in Euc+(2).
□
4. Symmetry groups of plane ﬁgures
If S ⊆R2 is a non-empty subset, we can consider the subset
Euc(2)S = {α ∈Euc(2) : αS = S} ⊆Euc(2).
Proposition 2.19. Euc(2)S is a subgroup of Euc(2), Euc(2)S ⩽Euc(2)
Proof. By deﬁnition, for α ∈Euc(2),
αS = {α(s) : s ∈S}.
So αS = S if and only if
• for every s ∈S, α(s) ∈S;
• every s ∈S has the form s = α(s′) for some s′ ∈S.
Since an isometry is injective, this really says that each α ∈Euc(2)S acts by permuting the
elements of S and preserving distances between them.
If α, β ∈Euc(2)S then for s ∈S,
αβ(s) = α(β(s)) ∈αS = S.
Also, there is an s′ ∈S such that s = α(s′) and similarly an s′′ ∈S such that s′ = β(s′′); hence
s = α(s′) = α(β(s′′)) = αβ(s′′).
It is easy to see that IdR2 ∈Euc(2)S. Finally, if α ∈Euc(2)S then α−1 ∈Euc(2)S since
α−1S = α−1(αS) = (α−1α)S = S.
□
Euc(2)S is called the symmetry subgroup of S and is often referred to as the symmetry group
of S as a subset of R2.
Example 2.20. Let S ⊆R2 be the following pattern.

Find the symmetry subgroup of S.

2. GROUPS AND SYMMETRY
Solution. It is clear that there are translations which move each arrow a ﬁxed number
of steps right or left by distance equal to the horizontal distance between these arrows. If the
translation sending An to An+1 is Transt then each of the translations Transkt with k ∈Z is in
Euc(2)S. So
Euc(2)S = {Transkt : k ∈Z},
since it is also clear that there are no further isometries of R2 that map S into itself.
Note that this pattern is essentially the same as Frieze Pattern 1 in Figure 2.1.
□
In this case we see that all symmetries of S are translations and indeed all powers of a ﬁxed
one, since if k ⩽1,
Transkt = (Transt)k = Transt ◦· · · ◦Transt
|
{z
}
k factors
,
while if k ⩽−1,
Transkt = (Trans−t)−k = Trans−t ◦· · · ◦Trans−t
|
{z
}
−k factors
where (Transt)−1 = Trans−t. So the symmetry subgroup of this plane ﬁgure is cyclic with
generator Transt.
For any subset S ⊆R2 we can consider the set of translational symmetries of S,
Trans(2)S = Trans(2) ∩Euc(2)S ⊆Euc(2)S.
The following is easy to prove.
Lemma 2.21. Trans(2)S ⩽Euc(2)S.
A frieze pattern in the plane is a subset S ⊆R2 for which the subset of translational
symmetries Trans(2)S is an inﬁnite cyclic group. This means that there is a translation vector
t for which
Trans(2)S = ⟨Transt⟩= {Transkt : k ∈Z}.
The examples in Figure 2.1 illustrate all the possible symmetry groups for frieze patterns
that can occur. Notice that Pattern 1 is essentially equivalent to that of Example 2.20 since it
only has translational symmetries.
Example 2.22. Find the symmetry subgroup of Pattern 2.
Solution. Let S ⊆R2 be this pattern. Suppose that this lies along the x-axis with the
origin midway up an edge. Then if t is the vector pointing in the positive x-direction with length
equal to the width of a block, Euc(2)S contains the cyclic subgroup generated by Trans2t,
⟨Trans2t⟩= {Trans2kt : k ∈Z} ⩽Euc(2)S.
The glide reﬂection that reﬂects in the x-axis then moves each block by t has Seitz symbol
(Rx | t) where
Rx =
·
1
0
0
−1
¸
.
Clearly every symmetry is either a translation Trans2kt = (I | 2kt) for some k ∈Z, or a glide
reﬂection of the form (Rx | (2k + 1)t) for some k ∈Z, where
(Rx | (2k + 1)t) = (I | 2kt)(Rx | t).
So we have
Euc(2)S = ⟨Trans2t⟩∪{(Rx | (2k + 1)t) : k ∈Z}.

Therefore we have | Euc(2)△| = 6.
Notice that the identity and the two 3-cycles represent
rotations about O, while each of the three transpositions represents a reﬂection in lines through
O and a vertex.

Again we can describe symmetries in terms of their eﬀect on the vertices. Here are the eight

Example 2.25. Let R ⊆R2 be the rectangle centred at the origin O with vertices at A(2, 1),
B(−2, 1), C(−2, −1), D(2, −1).

A symmetry can send A to any of the vertices, and then the long edge AB must go to the longer
of the adjacent edges. This gives a total of 4 such symmetries, thus | Euc(2)R| = 4.
Again we can describe symmetries in terms of their eﬀect on the vertices. Here are the four
elements of Euc(2)R described using permutation notation.

(A C)(B D) represents a half turn about O while (A B)(C D) and (A D)(B C) represent
reﬂections in lines joining opposite midpoints of edges.
Example 2.26. Given a regular n-gon (i.e., a regular polygon with n sides all of the same
length and n vertices V1, V2, . . . , Vn), the symmetry group is a dihedral group of order 2n, with
elements
ι, α, α2, . . . , αn−1, β, αβ, α2β, . . . , αn−1β,
where αk is an anticlockwise rotation through 2πk/n about the centre and β is a reﬂection in
the line through V1 and the centre. In fact each of the elements α2β is a reﬂection in a line
through the centre. Moreover we have
|α| = n, |β| = 2, βαβ = αn−1 = α−1.
In permutation notation this becomes the n-cycle
α = (V1 V2 · · · Vn),
but β is more complicated to describe since it depends on whether n is even or odd.
For example, if n = 6 we have
α = (V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6),
β = (V2 V6)(V3 V5),
while if n = 7
α = (V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7),
β = (V2 V7)(V3 V6)(V4 V5).
We have seen that when n = 3, Euc(2)△is the permutation group of the vertices and so D6 is
essentially the same group as S6.
If we take the regular n-gon centred at the origin with the ﬁrst vertex V1 at (1, 0), the
generators α and β can be represented as (A | 0) and (B | 0) using the matrices
A =
·
cos 2π/n
−sin 2π/n
sin 2π/n
cos 2π/n
¸
,
B =

In this case the symmetry group is the dihedral group of order 2n,
D2n = {ι, α, α2, . . . , αn−1, β, αβ, α2β, . . . , αn−1β} ⩽O(2).
Notice that the subgroup of direct symmetries is
D+
2n = {ι, α, α2, . . . , αn−1} ⩽SO(2).

28
2. GROUPS AND SYMMETRY
More generally we have the following Theorem. A convex region of is a subset S ⊆R2 in
which for each pair of points x, y ∈S, the line segment joining them lies in S, i.e.,
{tx + (1 −t)y : 0 ⩽t ⩽1} ⊆S.
Convex
Non-convex
Theorem 2.27. If V1, . . . , Vn are the vertices in order of a polygon which bounds a convex
region P of R2 containing a point not on the boundary, then Euc(2)P can be identiﬁed with a
subgroup of the permutation group Perm{V1,...,Vn} of the vertices.
5. Similarity of isometries and subgroups of the Euclidean group
It is often the case that two subsets of the plane have the ‘same’ symmetry subgroups. For
example, any two frieze patterns which only have translational symmetries are the same in this
sense. We need to make this notion more precise.
A dilation or scaling of the plane is a function H : R2 −→R2 which has the form
H(x) = δ(x −c) + c,
where δ > 0 is the dilation factor and c is the centre of the dilation. It is easy to see that
H(c) = c and
|H(x) −c| = δ|x −c|,
so the eﬀect of H is the expand or contract the plane radially from the point c. We can rewrite
the above formula to give
H(x) = δx + (1 −δ)c,
so we can express H as the Seitz symbol (δI | (1 −δ)c). Of course, if δ = 1 then this is just the
identity function, otherwise it is not an isometry.
We can compose a dilation (δI | (1 −δ)c) with an isometry (A | t) to give a new function
R2 −→R2 with Seitz symbol
(δI | (1 −δ)c)(A | t) = (δA | δt + (1 −δ)c).
This has the form (δA | s) for some vector s and orthogonal matrix A. Provided that δ ̸= 1,
the matrix (I −δA) is invertible (this uses knowledge of the eigenvalues of A) and so the vector
s0 = (I −δA)−1s is the unique ﬁxed point of this transformation. Indeed, this transformation
amounts to a rotation or reﬂection about s0 followed by a dilation by δ centred at this point.
We will call such a transformation a similarity transformation of the plane centred at s0.
Now suppose that F1, F2 : R2 −→R2 are two isometries of the plane. If H : R2 −→R2 is a
similarity transformation, then F2 is H-similar to F1 if
F2 = H ◦F1 ◦H−1.
We will sometimes use the notation
H∗F = H ◦F ◦H−1.
We also say that F2 is similar to F1 if there is some similarity transformation H for which F2
is H-similar to F1.
If Γ ⊆Euc(2) then we set
H∗Γ = {H∗F : F ∈Γ} ⊆Euc(2).
Lemma 2.28. If Γ ⩽Euc(2) then H∗Γ ⩽Euc(2).

5. SIMILARITY OF ISOMETRIES AND SUBGROUPS OF THE EUCLIDEAN GROUP
29
Proof. For example, if F1, F2 ∈Γ then
(H∗F1) ◦(H∗F2) = H ◦F1 ◦H−1 ◦H ◦F2 ◦H−1 = H ◦(F1 ◦F2) ◦H−1 = H∗(F1 ◦F2).
□
For two subgroups Γ1 ⩽Euc(2) and Γ2 ⩽Euc(2), Γ2 is H-similar to Γ1 if
Γ2 = H∗Γ1.
We also say that Γ2 is similar to Γ1 if there is some similarity transformation H for which Γ2
is H-similar to Γ1.
Example 2.29. Consider any two rotations RotP,θ and RotQ,θ through the same angle θ.
Then RotQ,θ is similar to RotP,θ.
Proof. Let t = −−→
PQ = q −p. Then Transt ◦RotP,θ ◦Trans−t is a rotation through the
angle θ which has the following eﬀect on the point Q,
Transt ◦RotP,θ ◦Trans−t(q) = (q −p) + RotP,θ(q −(q −p))
= (q −p) + RotP,θ(p)
= (q −p) + p = q.
Hence this rotation ﬁxes Q, which must be its centre. Therefore
Transt ◦RotP,θ ◦Trans−t = RotQ,θ,
and RotQ,θ is similar to RotP,θ.
□
Example 2.30. Let u and v be any two non-zero vectors. Then Transv is similar to Transu.
Solution. Let δ = |v|/|u|. If the angle between u and v is θ, then
v = δ RotO,θ(u).
Now consider the similarity transformation obtained by composing a rotation with a dilation,
H = δ RotO,θ,
and with inverse
H−1 = (1/δ) RotO,−θ .
Then we have
H ◦Transu ◦H−1(x) = H(u + (1/δ) RotO,−θ x)
= δ RotO,θ(u + (1/δ) RotO,−θ x)
= δ RotO,θ(u) + δ RotO,θ((1/δ) RotO,−θ x)
= v + RotO,θ ◦RotO,−θ(x)
= v + x = Transv(x).
This show that
Transv = H ◦Transu ◦H−1,
so Transv is similar to Transu.
□
Using this result it is easy to deduce that ⟨Transv⟩is similar to ⟨Transu⟩.
Example 2.31. Let ∆1 and ∆2 be two equilateral triangles.
Show that the symmetry
subgroups Γ1 = Euc(2)∆1 and Γ2 = Euc(2)∆2 are similar.
Solution. Let the centres be at C1c1 and C2c2 and let the sides be of lengths ℓ1 and ℓ2.
Let the vertices of the triangles be U1, U2, U3 and V1, V2, V3 taken in order in the anti-clockwise
direction.
Setting δ = ℓ2/ℓ1, we construct the following sequence of transformations R2 −→R2.
• H1 is the translation which moves C1 to C2.
• H2 is the dilation by δ centred at C1.
• H3 is the rotation about C1 which sends each Ui to H−1
1
◦H−1
2 (Vi).

30
2. GROUPS AND SYMMETRY
Now take H = H3 ◦H2 ◦H1.
Now let F ∈Γ1. Then for each vertex Vi, F(Vi) is a vertex and the eﬀect of F on the
vertices determines F. Then for each Vi,
H∗F(Vi) = H ◦F ◦H−1(Vi) = H3 ◦H2 ◦H1 ◦F(Ui),
which is a vertex of ∆2, so H∗F is indeed a symmetry of ∆2.
It is easy to see that every
symmetry of ∆2 arises as H∗F for some F. Hence Γ2 = H∗Γ1 and so Γ2 is similar to Γ1.
□
6. Finite subgroups of the Euclidean group of the plane
In this section we will describe all ﬁnite subgroups of Euc(2), up to similarity transforma-
tions. First we will show that every ﬁnite subgroup has a ﬁxed point, i.e., a point ﬁxed by every
element of Γ.
Theorem 2.32. Let Γ ⩽Euc(2) be a ﬁnite subgroup. Then there is a point of R2 ﬁxed by
every element of Γ.
Proof. Let the distinct elements of Γ be F1, . . . , Fn, where n = |Γ|. Let p ∈R2 be (the
position vector of) any point. Deﬁne
p0 = 1
nF1(p) + · · · + 1
nFn(p).
For any k = 1, . . . , n, by a result on Problem Sheet 4, we have
Fk(p0) = 1
nFkF1(p) + · · · + 1
nFkFn(p).
Now if FkFi = FkFj, then F −1
k FkFi = F −1
k FkFj and so Fi = Fj. Also, every Fr can be written
as Fr = Fk(F −1
k Fr) where F −1
k Fr ∈Γ has the form F −1
k Fr = Fs for some s and therefore
Fr = FkFs. So in the above expression for Fk(p0), the terms are the same as those in the
formula for p0 apart from the order in which they appear. This shows that Fk(p0) = p0.
□
Remark 2.33. In the proof we can of course take p = 0, but any initial value will do. Also,
if Γ contains a non-trivial rotation then it has exactly one ﬁxed point, so it doesn’t matter what
we choose for p since p0 will be this unique ﬁxed point.
Corollary 2.34. Let Γ ⩽Euc(2) be a ﬁnite subgroup. Then Γ is similar to a ﬁnite subgroup
of the orthogonal group O(2).
Proof. Let q be any ﬁxed point of Γ. Setting H = Trans−q, for F ∈Γ we have
H∗F(0) = Trans−q F Transq(0) = Trans−q F(q + 0) = F(q) −q = q −q = 0.
Thus H∗Γ ⩽O(2).
□
Let us now consider ﬁnite subgroups of O(2). First we describe all commutative subgroups,
beginning with ﬁnite groups of rotations. Recall that
SO(2) = {(A | 0) ∈O(2) : det A = 1} ⩽O(2) ⩽Euc(2).
Furthermore, if (A | 0) ∈SO(2) then
A =
·
cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ
¸
for some angle θ ∈R. Notice that for all θ, ϕ ∈R,
·
cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ
¸ ·
cos ϕ
−sin ϕ
sin ϕ
cos ϕ
¸
=
·
cos(θ + ϕ)
−sin(θ + ϕ)
sin(θ + ϕ)
cos(θ + ϕ)
¸
=
·
cos ϕ
−sin ϕ
sin ϕ
cos ϕ
¸ ·
cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ
¸
,
which shows that SO(2) is in fact commutative.

7. FRIEZE PATTERNS AND THEIR SYMMETRY GROUPS
31
Proposition 2.35. Let Γ ⩽SO(2) be a ﬁnite subgroup. Then Γ is cyclic with a generator
of the form ⟨(A | 0)⟩for some matrix
A =
·
cos 2π/d
−sin 2π/d
sin 2π/d
cos 2π/d
¸
where d = 1, 2, . . ..
Proof. We won’t prove this here, but note that proofs can be found in many books or in
3H Algebra.
The element (A | 0) ∈Γ can be chosen so that
A =
·
cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ
¸
,
where the angle θ ∈[0, 2π) is as small as possible. Since Γ is a ﬁnite group, every element has
ﬁnite order, and so θ = 2kπ/d for some d = 1, 2, . . . and k = 0, 1, . . . , (d −1). It is always
possible to arrange things so that k = 1. Notice that ⟨(A | 0)⟩represents rotation about the
origin through the angle 2π/d.
□
Proposition 2.36. Let Γ ⩽O(2) be a ﬁnite subgroup. Then either Γ ⩽SO(2) or Γ is
similar to a dihedral group D2n for some n ⩾1.
Proof. Again we will not give a proof.
□
7. Frieze patterns and their symmetry groups
In this section we will see how frieze patterns can be understood by classifying their symme-
try groups up to similarity. Recall that the group of translational symmetries of a frieze pattern
is inﬁnite and cyclic. We will discuss in detail the seven distinct patterns shown in the handout
on Frieze Patterns.
Pattern 1. This only has translational symmetries. There is a smallest translation vector
t1 say, with
Euc(2)Pattern 1 = ⟨Transt1⟩.
Notice that there are no points simultaneously ﬁxed by all the elements of this symmetry group,
hence there can be no non-trivial ﬁnite subgroups.
· · ·
L

L
· · ·
Pattern 2. This has a glide reﬂection γ2 whose square is a translation by t2, say. The
symmetry group is inﬁnite and cyclic,
Euc(2)Pattern 2 = ⟨γ2⟩.
Again there are no points simultaneously ﬁxed by all the elements of this symmetry group, so
there are no non-trivial ﬁnite subgroups.

2. GROUPS AND SYMMETRY
Pattern 3. This has a smallest translation vector t3 say, but also some reﬂections in lines
perpendicular to t3. If we choose such a reﬂection σ3 in a line L, say, then any other such
reﬂection is either in a parallel line Lkt3 obtained by translating L by some integer multiple kt3,
or reﬂection in a line L(ℓ+1/2)t3 obtained by translating by some multiple (ℓ+ 1/2)t3 for some
ℓ∈Z. However, from the proof of Proposition 1.6, we know that
ReﬂLkt3 = Trans2kt3 ◦ReﬂL = Trans2kt3 ◦σ3,
ReﬂL(ℓ+1/2)t3 = Trans(2ℓ+1)t3 ◦ReﬂL = Trans(2ℓ+1)t3 ◦σ3.
This group is not commutative, e.g., σ3 ◦Transt3 = Trans−t3 ◦σ3. Writing
α = Transt3,
β = σ3,
then we see that abstractly this group has the following form,
{αr : r ∈Z} ∪{αrβ : r ∈Z},
where α, β satisfy the following relations:
β2 = ι,
βαβ = α−1.
It is easy to see that for r ∈Z,
βαrβ = α−r.
This is an inﬁnite version of the dihedral groups D2n, and it is often referred to as D∞. We will
use the notation
Euc(2)Pattern 3 = D∞,3.
Notice that every such symmetry for this frieze is obtained by combining a power of Transt3
with the zeroth or ﬁrst power of σ3.
There are points ﬁxed simultaneously by all the elements of this symmetry group, and indeed
there are some non-trivial ﬁnite subgroups of Euc(2)Pattern 3. These are obtained by taking one
of the vertical reﬂections ReﬂLkt3, ReﬂL(ℓ+1/2)t3 and considering the cyclic subgroups (each with
two elements)
D
ReﬂLkt3
E
,
D
ReﬂL(ℓ+1/2)t3
E
.
Each of these subgroups ﬁxes all the points on the corresponding line of reﬂection and no others.

Pattern 4. This time there is a shortest translation vector t4 say. There are also two types
of rotations, namely half rotations about points marked • and ×. If we choose one of these to
be ρ4 centred at c say, then one of the other type is obtained by composing it with translation
by t4, to give a half rotation about the point c + (1/2)t4, i.e.,
ρ′
4 = Transt4 ◦ρ4.
More generally, the half rotation symmetries are of the form
Trans2kt4 ◦ρ4, Trans(2k+1)t4 ◦ρ4
(k ∈Z).
Each of these generates a cyclic subgroup of order 2,
⟨Trans2kt4 ◦ρ4⟩,

We also have

square is γ5 ◦γ5 = Transt5. There is also a reﬂection symmetry σ5 in the vertical line L. Let
Lv denote the line obtained by translation of L by a vector v. Then the half rotation ρ5 about
one of the points marked • at (−1/4)t5 away from L agrees with the composition
ρ5 = γ5 ◦σ5.
The following equations also hold:
σ5 ◦γ5 ◦σ5 = γ5−1,

The remaining rotations and glide reﬂections have the form
Transkt5 ◦ρ5,

for k ∈Z. The symmetry group is again a dihedral group with generators

A wallpaper pattern in the plane is a subset W ⊆R2 whose group of translational symmetries
Trans(2)W has two linearly independent generators u, v, so
(2.2)
Trans(2)W = {Transmu+nv : m, n ∈Z} = ⟨Transu, Transv⟩,
with neither of u and v being a multiple of the other. This means that the angle between them

The set of points

In the situation where Equation (2.2) holds we have
Trans(2)W = {Transt : t ∈spanZ(u, v)}
and call spanZ(u, v) the translation lattice of W. Examples of all the basic types of lattices that
occur are shown in Figures 2.2–2.6.

We will discuss plane patterns making use of their translation lattices. First we remark that
if the symmetry group of a plane pattern W contains the group of translations
⟨Transu, Transv⟩= {(mu + nv | 0) : m, n ∈Z}.
then given any point W with position vector w ∈W, each of the points
w + mu + nv
(m, n ∈Z)
is in W. If Euc(2)W,w ⩽Euc(2)W is the symmetry subgroup ﬁxing the point W and if Wm,n is
the point with position vector w + mu + mv for some m, n ∈Z, then
Euc(2)W,Wm,n = H∗Euc(2)W,w,
where H = Transmu+nv. So to understand the symmetries of W we can conﬁne attention to a

Such a fundamental region F is useful because the position vector p every point in the plane
can be uniquely expressed in the form
p = p′ + mu + nv
for some point p′ ∈F and m, n ∈Z. This allows us to tile the plane with copies of a ﬁg-
ure located within a fundamental region. The square lattice design of Figure 2.7 is obtained
by translating (using vectors mu + nv for (m, n ∈Z)) the pattern

Figure 2.7. Square lattice pattern obtained from a fundamental region
Given a wallpaper pattern W with translation lattice spanZ(u, v), associated with a point
P in the is the subgroup Euc(2)W,P ⩽Euc(2)W of symmetries that ﬁx P. In particular, when
P = O, we can consider
O(2)W = Euc(2)W,O ∩O(2) ⩽O(2),
called the holohedry subgroup of W. If P ∈W the point group of P in W is the subgroup
O(2)W,P = {(A | 0) ∈O(2) : (A | t) ∈Euc(2)W,P for some t ∈R2} ⩽O(2).
Note that if (A | t) ∈Euc(2)W it is not necessarily true that (A | 0) ∈Euc(2)W. The point
group of W is
O(2)W = {(A | 0) : (A | t) ∈Euc(2)W for some t ∈R2} ⩽O(2).
If there is a point P for which O(2)W,P ⩽Euc(2)W then W is called symmomorphic.
We now describe the seventeen distinct wallpaper patterns up to similarity of their symmetry
groups; examples of each type are shown in Figures 2.8–2.24. There is a standard notation used
to describe these and names such as ‘pm’ will be used to allow interested readers to pursue the
details in books and other sources.

Pattern p1. The symmetry group of the fundamental region here is trivial, so the holohedry
group is {I}. The full symmetry group is given by the translation lattice,
{I | mu + nv : m, n ∈Z}.

Pattern pmm. The fundamental region has reﬂection symmetries in the x and y-axes with
Seitz symbols (Sx | 0) and (Sy | 0). These compose to give the half rotation (−I | 0). So the
holohedry group is the dihedral group D4 and the full symmetry group is
{(I | mu + nv) : m, n ∈Z} ∪{(−I | mu + nv) : m, n ∈Z}
∪{(Sx | mu + nv) : m, n ∈Z} ∪{(Sy | mu + nv) : m, n ∈Z}
which consists of translations (I | mu + nv), half rotations (−I | mu + nv) and glide reﬂections
(Sx | mu + nv), (Sy | mu + nv).
Pattern pgm. The fundamental region has a half rotation symmetry so the holohedry
group is
{(I | 0), (−I | 0)}.

CHAPTER 3
Isometries in 3 dimensions
1. Some 3-dimensional vector geometry
We will use similar notation to that of Chapter 1, denoting the position vector of a point P
in 3-space p, etc. We will also identify P with its position vector p ∈R3 and the position vector
(x, y, z) with the column vector


x
y
z

. We will often use the standard unit vectors i = (1, 0, 0),
j = (0, 1, 0), k = (0, 0, 1).
The scalar product of the vectors u = (u1, u2, u3) and v = (v1, v2, v3) is the real number
u · v = u1v1 + v2u2 + v3u3 ∈R.
The length of v is the non-negative real number
|v| = √v · v =
q
v2
1 + v2
2 + v2
3.
The angle between u and v is
cos−1 u · v
|u| |v| ∈[0, π].
In place of lines in R2 we now have planes in R3. Such a plane P is speciﬁed by an implicit
equation of the form
ax + by + cz = d,
where (a, b, c) ̸= 0. Thus we have
(3.1a)
P = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : ax + by + cz = d}.
It is worth remarking that the vector (a, b, c) is perpendicular to P. An alternative way to write
the implicit equation is
(a, b, c) · (x, y, z) = d,
so we also have
(3.1b)
P = {x ∈R3 : (a, b, c) · x = d}.
To determine d it suﬃces to know any point x0 on P, then d = (a, b, c) · x0.
Suppose that the vectors u and v are parallel to P and so perpendicular to (a, b, c) and also
that neither is a scalar multiple of the other (hence they are linearly independent) then we can
use the parametric equation
x = su + tv + x0,
where s, t ∈R and x0 is some point on P. It is often useful to take u and v to be unit vectors.
Then
(3.1c)
P = {su + tv + x0 ∈R3 : s, t ∈R}.
Given this parametric form for the plane P, it is possible to ﬁnd a vector normal to it using the
vector or cross product of u = (u1, u2, u3) and v = (v1, v2, v3), which is the vector
u × v = (D1, D2, D3),
for which

Proposition 3.1. The vector product has the following properties. For u, v, w ∈R3 and
t ∈R,
u × (v + w) = u × v + u × w,
(a)
(tu) × v = t(u × v),
(b)
v × u = −u × v,
(c)
u · (u × v) = 0,
(d)
u × v ̸= 0
if u and v are linearly independent.
(e)
Corollary 3.2. u × v is normal to u and v.
Proof. This follows from (c) and (d).
□
Thus for the above plane P, u × v is a vector normal to P and so we obtain the implicit
equation
(u × v) · x = (u × v) · x0,
where x0 is any known point on P.
Given an implicit equation for a plane of the form
w · x = d
together with a non-zero vector u parallel to P, we can use the vector product to ﬁnd another
vector parallel to P, namely
v = w × u.
The vectors u, v, w (taken in that order) form a right handed system in that they have the
same orientation as the ﬁrst ﬁnger, second ﬁnger and thumb of a right hand, or equivalently are
oriented like the standard basis vectors i, j, k or the positive x, y and z-axes. We also have the
formulæ
w = u × v,
u = v × w.
Each of the sequences v, w, u and w, u, v is a right handed system, while the sequences u, w, v,
v, u, w and w, v, u are all left handed. If the vectors u, v, w are mutually normal unit vectors
they are said to form a right or left handed orthonormal system. Here is a useful result for
checking whether a system of mutually normal unit vectors is right or left handed.
Proposition 3.3. A sequence of mutually normal unit vectors u, v, w is a right handed
orthonormal system if and only if
¯¯¯¯¯¯

(u × v) · w =

This quantity is often called the vector triple product of u, v, w and written [u, v, w].

2. ISOMETRIES OF 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE

Example 3.4. Find implicit and parametric equations for the plane P containing the points
with position vectors p = (1, 0, 1), q = (1, 1, 1) and r = (0, 1, 0).
Solution. Let us begin with a parametric equation. Notice that the vectors
u = q −p = (0, 1, 0),
v = r −p = (−1, 1, −1)
are parallel to P and linearly independent since neither is a scalar multiple of the other. Thus
a parametric equation is
x = s(0, 1, 0) + t(−1, 1, −1) + (1, 0, 1) = (1 −t, s + t, 1 −t)
(s, t ∈R).
To obtain an implicit equation we need a vector normal to P. For this we can use
w = u × v = (−1, 0, 1).
This gives the equation
(−1, 0, 1) · x = (−1, 0, 1) · (1, 0, 1) = 0
since p = (1, 0, 1) is in P. On writing x = (x, y, z) this becomes
−x + z = 0.
In this example we could start with w = (−1, 0, 1) and u = (0, 1, 0) then produce a second
vector parallel to P, namely
w × u = (−1, 0, 1) × (0, 1, 0) = (1, 0, −1).
These three vectors are mutually perpendicular.
□
2. Isometries of 3-dimensional space
Definition 3.5. An isometry of R3 is a distance preserving function F : R3 −→R3.
Here, the phrase distance preserving means that for points P and Q with position vectors
p and q,
|F(P)F(Q)| = |PQ|,
i.e.,
|F(p) −F(q)| = |p −q|.
Proposition 3.6. An isometry F : R3 −→R3 preserves angles between lines and vectors.
We have a similar result to a familiar one for R2.
Theorem 3.7. Every isometry F : R3 −→R3 has the form
F(x) = Ax + t,
where A is a 3 × 3 real orthogonal matrix and t ∈R3.
Furthemore, A and t are uniquely
detrmined by F.
We will use the Seitz symbol (A | t) to denote the isometry R3 −→R3 deﬁned by
x 7−→Ax + t.
As in the 2-dimensional situation, a 3×3 real orthogonal matrix A has determinant det A = ±1.
There are several types of isometries in R3, some very diﬀerent from those occurring in R2.
Translations. These have Seitz symbols of form (I3 | t) and behave in similar ways to
translations of R2.
Reﬂections. In R3, the reﬂection in a plane P has Seitz symbol of the form (S | 2w) where
w is the position vector of a point on P and is perpendicular to this plane, while the orthogonal
matrix S has the eﬀect
Sw = −w,
Su = u
for u a vector parallel to P.
Such an orthogonal matrix has determinant det S = −1.

Glide reﬂections. The Seitz symbol of a glide reﬂection in a plane P has the form
(S | 2w + u) = (I3 | u)(S | 2w),
where (S | 2w) is reﬂection in the plane P containing the point with position vector w which
is also perpendicular to P, while u is parallel to P. This is very similar to the situation with a
glide reﬂection in a line in R2. We will usually think of reﬂections as glide reﬂections.
Rotations. The Seitz symbol of a rotation about a line has Seitz symbol of the form (R | t)
where R is orthogonal and det R = 1. Using ideas about eigenvalues and eigenvectors it can
be shown that for such a matrix, either R = I3 or (R | 0) represents a rotation about the line
through the origin
L1 = {x ∈R3 : Rx = x}.
We usually refer to L1 as the axis of rotation of (R | 0) or even of R.
If we choose a unit vector v1 ∈L1 and any non-zero vector v2 perpendicular to L1, then
v3 = v1 × v2 is perpendicular to L1 and in fact
v3 · v2 = 0 = v3 · v1,
|v3| = |v2|.
In practise we usually take |v3| = |v2| = 1. These three vectors form a right handed orthonormal
basis of R3 and every vector x ∈R3 can be uniquely expressed as
x = x′
1v1 + x′
2v2 + x′
3v3
where
x′
1 = v1 · x,
x′
2 = v2 · x,
x′
3 = v3 · x.
The eﬀect of the rotation (R | 0) on an arbitrary vector is given by

representing a rotation through θ in the plane spanned by v2 and v3, so θ is the angle of rotation
about L1.
The more general type of rotation is about a line L′ parallel to a line L1 through the origin.
In this situation, the Seitz symbol (R | t) has translation vector t perpendicular to L1 and L′.
This means that t is in the plane P and so it can be expressed as
t = t2v2 + t3v3.
Then the point in P with position vector c = c2v2 + c3v3 satisfying
(R | t)c = c
is found by solving the equation
Rc + t = c,

(I3 −R)c = t.

vector c is the position vector of a point on the axis of rotation L′.
Screw rotations. There are some new types of isometry in R3 which have no analogues
in R2. The ﬁrst of these is screw rotation. Such an isometry has Seitz symbol (R | t) where
det R = 1 and we will write
t = t′ + w,
with t′ normal to the axis of rotation L of R and w parallel to it. Then
(R | t) = (R | t′ + w) = (I3 | w)(R | t′),
which represents a rotation about a line parallel to L followed by a translation parallel to L.
If w ̸= 0, we usually think of the direction of w as that of a forward pointing screw and
measure the angle of rotation as positive if the plane turns like a right handed screw driver.
This means that if we assume that the unit vector ˆw together with a pair of normal unit vectors
ˆu, ˆv perpendicular to L form a right handed system ˆu, ˆv, ˆw, then the angle of rotation θ is given
by
Rˆu = cos θˆu + sin θˆv,
Rˆv = −sin θˆu + cos θˆv.

det R = 1,
so this matrix represents a rotation. First we ﬁnd the axis of rotation of the matrix R. Clearly
this is the y-axis, so let us take the unit vector j = (0, 1, 0) parallel to it. Now the unit vectors
i = (1, 0, 0) and k = (0, 0, 1) are normal and also normal to j. We have to take a right handed
system made up from ±i, ±j, ±k. The system i, k, j is left handed, but since i × (−k) = j, we
can replace k by −k to get the right handed orthonormal system i, −k, j. For this we have
Ri = cos π/6i + sin π/6(−k),
R(−k) = −sin π/6i + cos π/6(−k).
Hence R represents a rotation through π/6 about the y-axis where we measure positive angles
so that i turns towards −k. The translation vector t = (0, 7, 0) = 7j points in the same direction
as j.

Screw reﬂections. A screw reﬂection has Seitz symbol of the form (A | t) where A is
orthogonal and det A = −1. Then there is a unit vector v1 for which
Av1 = −v1,
and a unit vector v2 normal to v1 together with the unit vector v3 = v1 × v2 for which
Av2 = cos θv2 + sin θv3,
Av3 = −sin θv2 + cos θv3.

Geometrically this represents the composition of reﬂection in the plane perpendicular to v1
composed with rotation about the line through the origin parallel to v1.
If we now write
t = u + 2w
where w is parallel to v1 and u is perpendicular to v1, then (A | t) represents the composition
of reﬂection in the plane
v1 · x = v1 · w
and rotation about the axis parallel to v1 and passing through the point with position vector c
and satisfying the two conditions
v1 · c = 0,
(I −A)c = u.
3. The Euclidean group of R3
The set of all isometries R3 −→R3 is denoted Euc(3) and forms the 3-dimensional Eucli-
dean group (Euc(3), ◦) under composition of functions. Much of the general theory for Euc(2)
discussed in Chapter 1 carries over to Euc(3) with obvious minor modiﬁcations. In particular,
the following generalization of Theorem 2.32 is true.
Theorem 3.9. Let Γ ⩽Euc(3) be a ﬁnite subgroup. Then there is a point of R2 ﬁxed by
every element of Γ.
There are obvious notions of similarity generalizing those for Euc(2) to Euc(3).
We deﬁne the 3 × 3 orthogonal group to be
O(3) = {(A | 0) : AT A = I3} ⩽Euc(3)
and the 3 × 3 special orthogonal group to be
SO(3) = {(A | 0) : AT A = I3, det A = 1} ⩽O(3) ⩽Euc(3).
Notice that we can view Euc(2) as a subgroup of Euc(3), i.e., Euc(2) ⩽Euc(3), by thinking
of Euc(2) as consisting of isometries of R3 that ﬁx all the points on the z-axis. Thus
Euc(2) =

⩽Euc(3).
In particular we have O(2) ⩽O(3) and SO(2) ⩽SO(3).
As far as the ﬁnite subgroups of Euc(3) are concerned, the following result classiﬁes them
up to similarity.
Proposition 3.10. Let Γ ⩽Euc(3) be a ﬁnite subgroup. Then Γ is similar to either a
subgroup of O(2) or to the symmetry group of one of the Platonic solids.
The Platonic solids are the ﬁve regular solids, i.e., the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron,
the icosahedron and the dodecahedron. These have the following numbers of vertices, edges and
faces.
