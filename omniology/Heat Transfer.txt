Introduction
1	 Introduction
Energy is defined as the capacity of a substance to do work. It is a property of the substance and it can 
be transferred by interaction of a system and its surroundings. The student would have encountered 
these interactions during the study of Thermodynamics. However, Thermodynamics deals with the end 
states of the processes and provides no information on the physical mechanisms that caused the process 
to take place. Heat Transfer is an example of such a process. A convenient definition of heat transfer is 
energy in transition due to temperature differences. Heat transfer extends the Thermodynamic analysis 
by studying the fundamental processes and modes of heat transfer through the development of relations 
used to calculate its rate. 
The aim of this chapter is to console existing understanding and to familiarise the student with the 
standard of notation and terminology used in this book. It will also introduce the necessary units.
1.1	
Heat Transfer Modes
The different types of heat transfer are usually referred to as ‘modes of heat transfer’. There are three of 
these: conduction, convection and radiation. 
• Conduction: This occurs at molecular level when a temperature gradient exists in a 
medium, which can be solid or fluid. Heat is transferred along that temperature gradient by 
conduction. 
• Convection: Happens in fluids in one of two mechanisms: random molecular motion 
which is termed diffusion or the bulk motion of a fluid carries energy from place to place. 
Convection can be either forced through for example pushing the flow along the surface or 
natural as that which happens due to buoyancy forces.
• Radiation: Occurs where heat energy is transferred by electromagnetic phenomenon, of 
which the sun is a particularly important source. It happens between surfaces at different 
temperatures even if there is no medium between them as long as they face each other.
In many practical problems, these three mechanisms combine to generate the total energy flow, but it 
is convenient to consider them separately at this introductory stage. We need to describe each process 
symbolically in an equation of reasonably simple form, which will provide the basis for subsequent 
calculations. We must also identify the properties of materials, and other system characteristics, that 
influence the transfer of heat.

Introduction
1.2	
System of Units
Before looking at the three distinct modes of transfer, it is appropriate to introduce some terms and units 
that apply to all of them. It is worth mentioning that we will be using the SI units throughout this book:
• The rate of heat flow will be denoted by the symbol Q. It is measured in Watts (W) and 
multiples such as (kW) and (MW).
• It is often convenient to specify the flow of energy as the heat flow per unit area which 
is also known as heat flux. This is denoted by q. Note that, q = Q/A where A is the area 
through which the heat flows, and that the units of heat flux are (W/m2). 
• Naturally, temperatures play a major part in the study of heat transfer. The symbol T will 
be used for temperature. In SI units, temperature is measured in Kelvin or Celsius: (K) 
and (°C). Sometimes the symbol t is used for temperature, but this is not appropriate in 
the context of transient heat transfer, where it is convenient to use that symbol for time. 
Temperature difference is denoted in Kelvin (K). 
The following three subsections describe the above mentioned three modes of heat flow in more 
detail. Further details of conduction, convection and radiation will be presented in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 
respectively. Chapter 5 gives a brief overview of Heat Exchangers theory and application which draws 
on the work from the previous Chapters.
1.3	
Conduction
The conductive transfer is of immediate interest through solid materials. However, conduction within 
fluids is also important as it is one of the mechanisms by which heat reaches and leaves the surface of 
a solid. Moreover, the tiny voids within some solid materials contain gases that conduct heat, albeit not 
very effectively unless they are replaced by liquids, an event which is not uncommon. Provided that a 
fluid is still or very slowly moving, the following analysis for solids is also applicable to conductive heat 
flow through a fluid.

Introduction
Figure 1.1 shows, in schematic form, a process of conductive heat transfer and 
identifies the key quantities to be considered:
Q: the heat flow by conduction in the x-direction (W)
A: the area through which the heat flows, normal to the x-direction (m2)
G[
G7 : the temperature gradient in the x-direction (K/m)
These quantities are related by Fourier’s Law, a model proposed as early as 1822:

A significant feature of this equation is the negative sign. This recognises that the natural direction for 
the flow of heat is from high temperature to low temperature, and hence down the temperature gradient. 
The additional quantity that appears in this relationship is k, the thermal conductivity (W/m K) of the 
material through which the heat flows. This is a property of the particular heat-conducting substance and, 
like other properties, depends on the state of the material, which is usually specified by its temperature 
and pressure. 
The dependence on temperature is of particular importance. Moreover, some materials such as those used 
in building construction are capable of absorbing water, either in finite pores or at the molecular level, 
and the moisture content also influences the thermal conductivity. The units of thermal conductivity 
have been determined from the requirement that Fourier’s law must be dimensionally consistent.

Table 1.1 gives the values of thermal conductivity of some representative solid materials, for conditions 
of normal temperature and pressure. Also shown are values of another property characterising the flow 
of heat through materials, thermal diffusivity, which is related to the conductivity by:

The thermal diffusivity indicates the ability of a material to transfer thermal energy relative to its ability 
to store it. The diffusivity plays an important role in unsteady conduction, which will be considered in 
Chapter 2.
As was noted above, the value of thermal conductivity varies significantly with temperature, even over 
the range of climatic conditions found around the world, let alone in the more extreme conditions of 
cold-storage plants, space flight and combustion. For solids, this is illustrated by the case of mineral wool, 
for which the thermal conductivity might change from 0.04 to 0.28 W/m K across the range 35 to -35 °C.

Table 1‑2 Thermal conductivity for typical gases and liquids
Note the very wide range of conductivities encountered in the materials listed in Tables 1.1 and 1.2. Some 
part of the variability can be ascribed to the density of the materials, but this is not the whole story (Steel 
is more dense than aluminium, brick is more dense than water). Metals are excellent conductors of heat 
as well as electricity, as a consequence of the free electrons within their atomic lattices. Gases are poor 
conductors, although their conductivity rises with temperature (the molecules then move about more 
vigorously) and with pressure (there is then a higher density of energy-carrying molecules). Liquids, and 
notably water, have conductivities of intermediate magnitude, not very different from those for plastics. 
The low conductivity of many insulating materials can be attributed to the trapping of small pockets of 
a gas, often air, within a solid material which is itself a rather poor conductor.
Example 1.1
Calculate the heat conducted through a 0.2 m thick industrial furnace wall made of fireclay brick. 
Measurements made during steady-state operation showed that the wall temperatures inside and outside 
the furnace are 1500 and 1100 K respectively. The length of the wall is 1.2m and the height is 1m.
Solution
We first need to make an assumption that the heat conduction through the wall is one dimensional.

Convection heat transfer occurs both due to molecular motion and bulk fluid motion. Convective heat 
transfer may be categorised into two forms according to the nature of the flow: natural Convection and 
forced convection.

Introduction
In natural of ‘free’ convection, the fluid motion is driven by density differences associated with temperature 
changes generated by heating or cooling. In other words, fluid flow is induced by buoyancy forces. 
Thus the heat transfer itself generates the flow which conveys energy away from the point at which the 
transfer occurs.
In forced convection, the fluid motion is driven by some external influence. Examples are the flows of 
air induced by a fan, by the wind, or by the motion of a vehicle, and the flows of water within heating, 
cooling, supply and drainage systems. In all of these processes the moving fluid conveys energy, whether 
by design or inadvertently.

Figure 1‑2: Illustration of the process of convective heat transfer
The left of Figure 1.2 illustrates the process of natural convective heat transfer. Heat flows from the 
‘radiator’ to the adjacent air, which then rises, being lighter than the general body of air in the room. 
This air is replaced by cooler, somewhat denser air drawn along the floor towards the radiator. The rising 
air flows along the ceiling, to which it can transfer heat, and then back to the lower part of the room to 
be recirculated through the buoyancy-driven ‘cell’ of natural convection. 
The word ‘radiator’ has been written above in that way because the heat transfer from such devices is not 
predominantly through radiation; convection is important as well. In fact, in a typical central heating 
radiator approximately half the heat transfer is by (free) convection.
The right part of Figure 1.2 illustrates a process of forced convection. Air is forced by a fan carrying with 
it heat from the wall if the wall temperature is lower or giving heat to the wall if the wall temperature 
is lower than the air temperature. 
If T1 is the temperature of the surface receiving or giving heat, and 
∞
T  is the average temperature of the 
stream of fluid adjacent to the surface, then the convective heat transfer Q is governed by Newton’s law:

Introduction
Another empirical quantity has been introduced to characterise the convective transfer mechanism. This 
is hc, the convective heat transfer coefficient, which has units [W/m2 K].
This quantity is also known as the convective conductance and as the film coefficient. The term film 
coefficient arises from a simple, but not entirely unrealistic, picture of the process of convective heat 
transfer at a surface. Heat is imagined to be conducted through a thin stagnant film of fluid at the surface, 
and then to be convected away by the moving fluid beyond. Since the fluid right against the wall must 
actually be at rest, this is a fairly reasonable model, and it explains why convective coefficients often 
depend quite strongly on the conductivity of the fluid.

Table 1‑3 Representative range of convective heat transfer coefficient
The film coefficient is not a property of the fluid, although it does depend on a number of fluid properties: 
thermal conductivity, density, specific heat and viscosity. This single quantity subsumes a variety of 
features of the flow, as well as characteristics of the convecting fluid. Obviously, the velocity of the 
flow past the wall is significant, as is the fundamental nature of the motion, that is to say, whether it is 
turbulent or laminar. Generally speaking, the convective coefficient increases as the velocity increases.
A great deal of work has been done in measuring and predicting convective heat transfer coefficients. 
Nevertheless, for all but the simplest situations we must rely upon empirical data, although numerical 
methods based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are becoming increasingly used to compute the 
heat transfer coefficient for complex situations. 
Table 1.3 gives some typical values; the cases considered include many of the situations that arise within 
buildings and in equipment installed in buildings.

A refrigerator stands in a room where the air temperature is 20oC. The surface temperature on the outside 
of the refrigerator is 16oC. The sides are 30 mm thick and have an equivalent thermal conductivity of 
0.1 W/m K. The heat transfer coefficient on the outside 9 is 10 W/m2K. Assuming one dimensional 
conduction through the sides, calculate the net heat flow and the surface temperature on the inside.

Radiation
While both conductive and convective transfers involve the flow of energy through a solid or fluid 
substance, no medium is required to achieve radiative heat transfer. Indeed, electromagnetic radiation 
travels most efficiently through a vacuum, though it is able to pass quite effectively through many gases, 
liquids and through some solids, in particular, relatively thin layers of glass and transparent plastics. 
Figure 1-3: Illustration of electromagnetic spectrum
Figure 1.3 indicates the names applied to particular sections of the electromagnetic spectrum where the 
band of thermal radiation is also shown. This includes: 
• the rather narrow band of visible light; 
• the wider span of thermal radiation, extending well beyond the visible spectrum.

Heat Transfer

Introduction
Our immediate interest is thermal radiation. It is of the same family as visible light and behaves in 
the same general fashion, being reflected, refracted and absorbed. These phenomena are of particular 
importance in the calculation of solar gains, the heat inputs to buildings from the sun and radiative heat 
transfer within combustion chambers.
It is vital to realise that every body, unless at the absolute zero of temperature, both emits and absorbs 
energy by radiation. In many circumstances the inwards and outwards transfers nearly cancel out, because 
the body is at about the same temperature as its surroundings. This is your situation as you sit reading 
these words, continually exchanging energy with the surfaces surrounding you. 
In 1884 Boltzmann put forward an expression for the net transfer from an idealised body (Black body) 
with surface area A1 at absolute temperature T1 to surroundings at uniform absolute temperature T2:

withσ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which has the value 5.67 × 10-8 W/m2 K4 and T [K] = T [°C] 
+ 273 is the absolute temperature.
The bodies considered above are idealised, in that they perfectly absorb and emit radiation of all wave-
lengths. The situation is also idealised in that each of the bodies that exchange radiation has a uniform 
surface temperature. A development of Boltzmann’s law which allows for deviations from this pattern is

the emissivity, or emittance, of the surface A1, a dimensionless factor in therange 0 to 
1, 
F12	
	
is the view factor, or angle factor, giving the fraction of the radiation from A1 that falls 
on the area A2 at temperature T2, and therefore also in the range 0 to 1.
Another property of the surface is implicit in this relationship: its absorbtivity. This has been taken to be 
equal to the emissivity. This is not always realistic. For example, a surface receiving short-wave-length 
radiation from the sun may reject some of that energy by re-radiation in a lower band of wave-lengths, 
for which the emissivity is different from the absorbtivity for the wave-lengths received.
The case of solar radiation provides an interesting application of this equation. The view factor for the 
Sun, as seen from the Earth, is very small; despite this, the very high solar temperature (raised to the 
power 4) ensures that the radiative transfer is substantial. Of course, if two surfaces do not ‘see’ one 
another (as, for instance, when the Sun is on the other side of the Earth), the view factor is zero. Table 
1.4 shows values of the emissivity of a variety of materials. Once again we find that a wide range of 
characteristics are available to the designer who seeks to control heat transfers.

Introduction
The values quoted in the table are averages over a range of radiation wave-lengths. For most materials, 
considerable variations occur across the spectrum. Indeed, the surfaces used in solar collectors are chosen 
because they possess this characteristic to a marked degree. The emissivity depends also on temperature, 
with the consequence that the radiative heat transfer is not exactly proportional to T3.
An ideal emitter and absorber is referred to as a ‘black body’, while a surface with an emissivity less 
than unity is referred to as ‘grey’. These are somewhat misleading terms, for our interest here is in the 
infra-red spectrum rather than the visible part. The appearance of a surface to the eye may not tell us 
much about its heat-absorbing characteristics.

Introduction
Although it depends upon a difference in temperature, Boltzmann’s Law (Equations 1.4, 1.5) does not 
have the precise form of the laws for conductive and convective transfers. Nevertheless, we can make 
the radiation law look like the others. We introduce a radiative heat transfer coefficient or radiative 
conductance through

where Tav is the average of the two temperatures. 
Obviously, this simplification is not applicable to the case of solar radiation. However, the temperatures 
of the walls, floor and ceiling of a room generally differ by only a few degrees. Hence the approximation 
given by Equation (1.7) is adequate when transfers between them are to be calculated.
Example 1.3
Surface A in the Figure is coated with white paint and is maintained at temperature of 200oC. It is located 
directly opposite to surface B which can be considered a black body and is maintained ate temperature of 
800oC. Calculate the amount of heat that needs to be removed from surface A per unit area to maintain 
its constant temperature.
Solution
The two surfaces are assumed to be infinite and close to each other that they are only exchanging heat 
with each other. The view factor can then assumed to be 1.

This amount of heat needs to be removed from surface A by other means such as conduction, convection

Summary
This chapter introduced some of the basic concepts of heat transfer and indicates their significance in 
the context of engineering applications. 
We have seen that heat transfer can occur by one of three modes, conduction, convection and radiation. 
These often act together. We have also described the heat transfer in the three forms using basic laws 
as follows:

The General Conduction Equation
Conduction occurs in a stationary medium which is most likely to be a solid, but conduction can also 
occur in fluids. Heat is transferred by conduction due to motion of free electrons in metals or atoms in 
non-metals. Conduction is quantified by Fourier’s law: the heat flux, q, is proportional to the temperature 
gradient in the direction of the outward normal. e.g. in the x-direction:

Conduction
Conduction may be treated as either steady state, where the temperature at a point is constant with time, 
or as time dependent (or transient) where temperature varies with time.
The general, time dependent and multi-dimensional, governing equation for conduction can be derived 
from an energy balance on an element of dimensions δx, δy, δz.
Consider the element shown in Figure 2.1. The statement of energy conservation applied to this element 
in a time period δt is that:
heat flow in + internal heat generation = heat flow out + rate of increase in internal energy

Conduction
A meaningful solution to one of the above conduction equations is not possible without information about 
what happens at the boundaries (which usually coincide with a solid-fluid or solid-solid interface). This 
information is known as the boundary conditions and in conduction work there are three main types:
1.	 where temperature is specified, for example the temperature of the surface of a turbine disc, 
this is known as a boundary condition of the 1st kind;
2.	 where the heat flux is specified, for example the heat flux from a power transistor to its heat 
sink, this is known as a boundary condition of the 2nd kind;
3.	 where the heat transfer coefficient is specified, for example the heat transfer coefficient 
acting on a heat exchanger fin, this is known as a boundary condition of the 3rd kind.

The Biot number can be thought of as the ratio of the thermal resistance due to conduction (L/k) to 
the thermal resistance due to convection 1/h. So for Bi << 1, temperature gradients within the solid 
are negligible and for Bi > 1 they are not. The Fourier number can be thought of as a time constant for 
conduction. For

current, temperature is of voltage and the denominator is the overall thermal resistance, comprising 
individual resistance terms from convection and conduction.
In building services it is common to quote a ‘U’ value for double glazing and building heat loss calculations. 
This is called the overall heat transfer coefficient and is the inverse of the overall thermal resistance.

The walls of the houses in a new estate are to be constructed using a ‘cavity wall’ design. This comprises 
an inner layer of brick (k = 0.5 W/m K and 120 mm thick), an air gap and an outer layer of brick (k = 0.3 
W/m K and 120 mm thick). At the design condition the inside room temperature is 20ºC, the outside 
air temperature is -10ºC; the heat transfer coefficient on the inside is 10 W/m2 K, that on the outside 
40 W/m2 K, and that in the air gap 6 W/m2 K. What is the heat flux through the wall?

Conduction
It is instructive to write out the separate terms in the denominator as it can be seen that the greatest 
thermal resistance is provided by the outer layer of brick and the least thermal resistance by convection 
on the outside surface of the wall. Once the heat flux is known it is a simple matter to use this to find 
each of the surface temperatures. For example,

Thermal Contact Resistance
In practice when two solid surfaces meet then there is not perfect thermal contact between them. This 
can be accounted for using an appropriate value of thermal contact resistance – which can be obtained 
either from experimental results or published, tabulated data.

Conduction
To analyse 1-D radial conduction problems:
Write down equations for the heat flow Q (not the flux, q, as in plane systems, since in a radial system 
the area is not constant, so q is not constant). For example, the heat flow through a pipe wall with 
convection on the outside and convection on the inside:

Conduction
Example 2.2
The Figure below shows a cross section through an insulated heating pipe which is made from steel 
(k = 45 W / m K) with an inner radius of 150 mm and an outer radius of 155 mm. The pipe is coated 
with 100 mm thickness of insulation having a thermal conductivity of k = 0.06 W / m K. Air at Ti = 
60°C flows through the pipe and the convective heat transfer coefficient from the air to the inside of 
the pipe has a value of hi = 35 W / m2 K. The outside surface of the pipe is surrounded by air which 
is at 15°C and the convective heat transfer coefficient on this surface has a value of ho = 10 W / m2 K. 
Calculate the heat loss through 50 m of this pipe.
Solution
Figure 2-3: Conduction through a radial wall
Unlike the plane wall, the heat flux is not constant (because the area varies with radius). So we write 
down separate equations for the heat flow, Q.

Again, the thermal resistance of the insulation is seen to be greater than either the steel or the two 
resistances due to convection.
Critical Insulation Radius
Adding more insulation to a pipe does not always guarantee a reduction in the heat loss. Adding more 
insulation also increases the surface area from which heat escapes. If the area increases more than the 
thermal resistance then the heat loss is increased rather than decreased.
The so-called critical insulation radius is the largest radius at which adding more insulation will create 
an increase in the heat loss

Fins and Extended Surfaces 
Figure 2-4: Examples of fins (a) motorcycel engine, (b) heat sink
Fins and extended surfaces are used to increase the surface area and therefore enhance the surface heat 
transfer. Examples are seen on: motorcycle engines, electric motor casings, gearbox casings, electronic 
heat sinks, transformer casings and fluid heat exchangers. Extended surfaces may also be an unintentional 
product of design. Look for example at a typical block of holiday apartments in a ski resort, each with a 
concrete balcony protruding from external the wall. This acts as a fin and draws heat from the inside of 
each apartment to the outside. The fin model may also be used as a first approximation to analyse heat 
transfer by conduction from say compressor and turbine blades.
2.3.1	
General Fin Equation
The general equation for steady-state heat transfer from an extended surface is derived by considering 
the heat flows through an elemental cross-section of length δx, surface area δAs and cross-sectional 
area Ac. Convection occurs at the surface into a fluid where the heat transfer coefficient is h and the 
temperature Tfluid.

Example 2.3
The design of a single ‘pin fin’ which is to be used in an array of identical pin fins on an electronics heat 
sink is shown in Figure 2.6. The fin is made from cast aluminium, k = 180 W / m K, the diameter is 
3 mm and the length 15 mm. There is a heat transfer coefficient of 30 W / m2 K between the surface of 
the fin and surrounding air which is at 25°C.
1.	 Use the expression for a fin with an adiabatic tip to calculate the heat flow through a single 
pin fin when the base has a temperature of 55°C.
2.	 Calculate also the efficiency and the effectiveness of this fin design.
3.	 How long would this fin have to be to be considered “infinite”?

Conduction
For an infinite fin, Tx = L = Tfluid. However, the fin could be considered infinite if the temperature at 
the tip approaches that of the fluid. If we, for argument sake, limit the temperature difference between 
fin tip and fluid to 5% of the temperature difference between fin base and fluid, then:

Using equation 2.33 for the temperature distribution and substituting x = L, noting that cosh (0) = 1, 
implies that 1/ cosh (mL) = 0.05. So, mL = 3.7, which requires that L > 247 mm.
Simple Time Dependent Conduction

A full analytical solution to the 1-D conduction equation is relatively complex and requires finding 
the roots of a transcendental equation and summing an infinite series (the series converges rapidly so 
usually it is adequate to consider half a dozen terms). There are two alternative possible ways in which a 
transient conduction analysis may be simplified, depending on the value of the Biot number (Bi = h L /k).
2.3.3	
Small Biot Number (Bi << 1): Lumped Mass Approximation
A small value of Bi implies either that the convective resistance 1/h, is large, or the conductive resistance 
L/k is small. Either of these conditions tends to reduce the temperature gradient in the material. For 
example there will be very little difference between the two surface temperatures of a heated copper plate 
(k ≈ 400 W/m K) of say 5 or 10 mm thickness. Whereas for Perspex (k ≈ 0.2 W/m K), there could be

we may treat it as a body with a homogenous temperature. A simple heat balance on a material of mass,

Large Biot Number (Bi >>1): Semi – Infinite Approximation
When Bi is large (Bi >> 1) there are, as explained above, large temperature variations within the material. 
For short time periods from the beginning of the transient (or to be more precise for Fo << 1), the 
boundary away from the surface is unaffected by what is happening at the surface and mathematically 
may be treated as if it is at infinity.
There are three so called semi-infinite solutions:
N.B. erfc(x) = 1 – erf(x); erf(x) = error function

As well as being useful in determining the temperature of a body at time, these low Biot number and 
large Biot number methods can also be used in the inverse mode. This is the reverse of the above and 
makes use of the temperature time history to determine the heat transfer coefficient.

Example 2.4
A titanium alloy blade from an axial compressor for which k = 25 W / m K, ρ = 4500 kg / m3 and  
C = 520 J/kg K, is initially at 40ºC. Although the blade thickness (from pressure to suction side) varies 
along the blade, the effective length scale for conduction may be taken as 3mm. When exposed to a hot 
gas stream at 350ºC, the blade experiences a heat transfer coefficient of 150 W / m2 K. Use the lumped 
mass approximation to estimate the blade temperature after 50 s.
Firstly, check that Bi << 1
Bi = h L / k = 150 x 0.003 / 25 = 0.018. So the lumped mass method can be used.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Summary
This chapter has introduced the mechanism of heat transfer known as conduction. In the context of 
engineering applications, this is more likely to be representative of the behaviour in solids than fluids. 
Conduction phenomena may be treated as either time-dependent or steady state.
It is relatively easy to derive and apply simple analytical solutions for one-dimensional steady-state 
conduction in both Cartesian (plates and walls) and cylindrical (pipes and pressure vessels) coordinates. 
Two-dimensional steady-state solutions are much more complex to derive and apply, so they are 
considered beyond the scope of this introductory level text.
Fins and extended surfaces are an important engineering application of a one-dimensional conduction 
analysis. The design engineer will be concerned with calculating the heart flow through the fin, the fin 
efficiency and effectiveness. A number of relatively simple relations were presented for fins where the 
surface and cross sectional areas are constant.
Time-dependent conduction has been simplified to the two extreme cases of Bi << 1 and Bi >> 1. For 
the former, the lumped mass method may be used and in the latter the semi-infinite method. It is worth 
noting that in both cases these methods are used in practical applications in the inverse mode to measure 
heat transfer coefficients from a know temperature-time history.

In many cases, the boundary conditions to a conduction analysis are provided in terms of the convective 
heat transfer coefficient. In this chapter a value has usually been ascribed to this, without explaining how 
and from where it was obtained. This will be the topic of the next chapter.

Convection
3	 Convection
In Chapter 1, we introduced the three modes of heat transfer as conduction, convection and radiation. 
We have analysed conduction in Chapters 2 in more detail and we only used convection to provide a 
possible boundary condition for the conduction problem. 
We also described convection briefly in Chapter 1 as the energy transfer between a surface and a fluid 
moving over the surface. Although the mechanism of molecular diffusion contributes to convection, the 
dominant mechanism is the bulk motion of the fluid particles.
We have also found that the conduction is dependent on the temperature gradient and thermal 
conductivity which is a physical property of the material. On the other hand, convection is a function 
of the temperature difference between the surface and the fluid and the heat transfer coefficient. The 
heat transfer coefficient is not a physical property of the material, but it rather depends on a number of 
parameters including fluid properties as well as the nature of the fluid motion.
Thus to obtain an accurate measure of the convective heat transfer coefficient requires analysis of the 
flow pattern in the vicinity of the surface in concern. The nature of the flow motion will depend on the 
geometry and boundary conditions to the region of interest.

Convection
Consequently, in this chapter we will develop basic methods used to characterise the flow leading to the 
calculation of the convective heat transfer coefficient. The concept of boundary layer will be introduced 
and distinction will be made between laminar and turbulent boundary layers and also the concept of 
transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer will be discussed. 
We will also distinguish two types of flow motion leading to two distinct mechanisms of heat transfer 
by convection. Forced convection, where the flow is pushed against a surface by external means, such 
as blowing, and natural convection where flow motion is due to the action of density variations leading 
to flow motion caused by body forces.
It is apparent from the above that convection is a complex physical phenomena governed by a large 
number of parameters. One way of allowing a systematic theoretical analysis is the use of the concept 
of dimensional analysis, which reduces the number of controlling parameters to few non-dimensional 
groupings. These lead to more general formulations for the convective heat transfer coefficient. 
3.1	
The convection equation
Heat conducted through a solid must eventually find its way to the surroundings. In most cases the heat 
supplied to this solid comes also from its surroundings i.e. heat transferred from the air of a room to 
the room walls then through the walls and eventually out into the ambient air.
This led to the introduction of Newton’s equation.

parameters necessary for heat transfer calculations. The convective coefficient h is evaluated in some 
limited cases by mathematical analytical methods and in most cases by experiments.

Flow equations and boundary layer
In this study, we are going to assume that the student is familiar with the flow governing equations. 
The interested reader can refer to basic fluid dynamics textbooks for their derivation. However, for 
clarity, we are going to state the flow equations to provide a more clear picture for the boundary layer 
simplifications mentioned below.

Fluid flow is covered by laws of conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The conservation of mass 
is known as the continuity equation. The conservation of momentum is described by the Navier-Stokes 
equations while the conservation of energy is described by the energy equation. The flow equations for

The velocity boundary layer 
Figure 3.1 shows fluid at uniform velocity U∞ approaching a plate and the resulting development of 
the velocity boundary layer. When the fluid particles make contact with the surface they assume zero 
velocity. These particles then tend to retard the motion of particles in the fluid layer above them which 
in term retard the motion of particles above them and so on until at a distance y = δ from the plate this 
effect becomes negligible and the velocity of the fluid particles is again almost equal to the original free 
stream velocity U∞.
The retardation of the fluid motion which results in the boundary layer at the fluid-solid interface is 
a result of shear stresses (τ) acting in planes that are parallel to the fluid velocity. The shear stress is 
proportional to the velocity gradient and is given by

Figure 0-1 The velocity boundary layer on a flat plate
The fluid flow as described above is characterized by two distinct regions: a thin fluid layer – the boundary 
layer – in which velocity gradient and shear stresses are large and an outer region – the free stream – 
where velocity gradients and shear stresses are negligible.
The quantity δ seen in the above figure is called the boundary layer thickness. It is formally defined as 
the value of y at which

Convection
The boundary layer velocity profile refers to the way in which the velocity u varies with distance y from 
the wall through the boundary layer.
3.2.2	
Laminar and turbulent boundary layer 
In convection problems it is essential to determine whether the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent. 
The convective coefficient h will depend strongly on which of these conditions exists.
There are sharp differences between laminar and turbulent flow conditions. In laminar boundary layers 
the fluid motion is highly ordered. Fluid particles move along streamlines. In contrast, fluid motion 
in the turbulent boundary layer is highly irregular. The velocity fluctuations that exist in this regular 
form of fluid flow result in mixing of the flow and as a consequence enhance the convective coefficient 
significantly.
Figure 3.2 shows the flow over a flat plate where the boundary layer is initially laminar. At some distance 
from the leading edge fluid fluctuations begin to develop. This is the transition region. Eventually with 
increasing distance from the leading edge complete transition to turbulence occurs. This is followed by 
a significant increase in the boundary layer thickness and the convective coefficient, see Figures 3.2 and 
3.4. Three different regions can be seen in the turbulent boundary layer. The laminar sublayer, the buffer 
layer and turbulent zone where mixing dominates. The location where transition to turbulence exists 
is determined by the value of theReynolds’s number which is a dimensionless grouping of variables.

The Thermal boundary layer 
Figure 3.3 shows analogous development of a thermal boundary layer. A thermal boundary layer must 
develop similar to the velocity boundary layer if there is a difference between the fluid free stream 
temperature and the temperature of the plate. The fluid particles that come in contact with the plate 
achieve thermal equilibrium with the surface and exchange energy with the particles above them. A 
temperature gradient is therefore established.

(3.8)
Because δt increases with x, the temperature gradient decrease with distance x (since the thermal 
boundary layer thickness increases) and therefore hx decreases with distance.
Equation 3.8 indicates that to be able to calculate the heat transfer coefficient, we need to know the 
temperature gradient in the boundary layer. To achieve this, either accurate measurements of the 
temperature distribution normal to the wall are required, or the flow equations (Equations 3.2) need to 
be solved to obtain the temperature distribution.
Analytic solutions to the flow equations are only possible for simple geometries and simple flows with 
various further simplifications. For most problems encountered in engineering applications, it is not 
possible to obtain analytic solutions to those equations. We are going to discuss the simplification to 
the flow equations for laminar boundary layers in the next subsection. Generally, three approaches are 
possible;
• Measurement of temperature distribution. This is a reliable approach as long as care is 
taken to obtain accurate measurements. However, this approach has several drawbacks. 
Measurements of the actual geometries might not be possible at the design stage. The 
measurements can be costly and time consuming.
• Numerical solution of the flow equation. This is becoming increasingly popular approach 
with the recent development of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques and 
the availability of cheap computing power. However, good knowledge of the boundary 
conditions is required. In addition, the accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the numerical 
procedure.
• The non-dimensionalisation procedure described in this Chapter is used with the analytical, 
numerical or experimental approaches mentioned above to reduce the number of analyses 
required. As we will see in more detail later, the controlling parameters are reduced to 
a much smaller number of non-dimensional groups, thus making use of the dynamic 
similarity in the calculation of the heat transfer coefficient.

Flow inside pipes 
As seen in Figure 3.5, when fluid with uniform velocity U∞ enters a pipe, a boundary layer develops on 
the pipe surface. This development continues down the pipe until the boundary layer is thick enough 
so it merges at the pipe centreline. The distance it takes to merge is called hydrodynamic length. After 
that the flow is termed fully developed and is laminar if Red < 2300 (where Red is the Reynolds number 
based on the pipe diameter, d, and the fluid mean velocity inside the pipe, um, i.e. (

and turbulent if Red > 4000 with the corresponding velocity profiles as shown in the figure.
Figure 3-5 Velocity boundary layer development in pipes (not to scale)
If the fluid and the pipe are at different temperatures then a thermal boundary layer develops in the pipe. 
This is shown in Figure 3.6 below for the case Ts > Tf. The above description of the hydrodynamic and 
thermal behaviour of the fluid is important because the convective heat transfer coefficient depends on 
whether the velocity and thermal fields are developing or developed and whether the flow is laminar 
or turbulent. This variation is similar to the variation of the convective coefficient with varying velocity 
and thermal fields on a flat plate see Figure 3.3.

The boundary layer approximation 
Although it is possible to solve the Navier-Stokes equations analytically for simple geometries and 
simple flows, it is useful to make use of the nature of the boundary layer to simplify the equations before 
attempting to solve them.
The boundary layer approximation is a simplification which recognises that the flow and temperature 
distribution in the boundary layers plays the most important role in affecting heat transfer. This leads to 
the so-called Boundary Layer Equations that are a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations. These 
arise from the simple observation, that the boundary layer thickness is much smaller than the length scale 
of the geometry in concern. Obviously, this is valid for a wide range of situations but not necessarily all.
Using this simplification, it is possible to neglect certain terms in the flow equations based on an order 
of magnitude analysis (see Long 1999). For a 2-dimensional flow in the (x,y) plane, the boundary layer 
equations can be written as:

.
This simplified form can then be solved to obtain the temperature profile near the wall and hence the 
heat transfer coefficient. Typically, the equations are first integrated term by term. An assumption for the 
shape of the velocity profile is assumed in the form of a polynomial. The coefficients of the polynomial 
can then be determined using the boundary conditions. This is then used to obtain the final solution. 
For the case of laminar flow over a flat plate, see Long (1999). 
It is worth mentioning here that despite the major simplifications made by the boundary layer 
approximation, these equations are still difficult to solve analytically and this is only possible for simple 
geometries and simple flows. One example is the laminar flow over a flat plate mentioned above. Thus 
engineers resort to numerical methods based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for solution of 
more complex problems.

Although the complete derivation of the analytic solutions was not shown here because they are out of the

geometry and the simple laminar flow over a flat plate, the analysis procedure is tedious. However, the 
order of magnitude analysis proves to be useful tool in revealing the relationship between the Nusselt 
number and the heat transfer coefficient with the basic flow features and fluid properties.

Dimensional analysis
Dimensional analysis has its foundations in the simple fact that units on both sides of an equation must 
be the same. Convective heat transfer is an example of a problem which can be very difficult to solve 
mathematically. An alternative is then dimensional analysis which attempts to relate important physical 
quantities i.e. velocity, temperature, fluid properties in dimensionless groups. 
There are several methods of reducing a number of dimensional variables into a smaller number of 
dimensionless groups. The scheme given here was proposed in 1914 by Buckingham, and is called the 
Buckingham pi theorem. The name pi comes from the mathematical notation π, meaning a product of 
variables. The dimensionless groups found from the theorem are power products denoted 
3
2
1
,
,
π
π
π
, 
etc. The theorem states that: 
“If an equation involving n variables is dimensionally homogenous, it can be reduced to a relationship 
among n – r independent dimensionless products were r is the minimum of reference dimensions 
required to describe the variables”.
Although the pi theorem is a simple one, its proof is not simple and will not be included here. 
The pi theorem is based on the idea of dimensional homogeneity of the equation in question. All 
theoretically derived equations are dimensionally homogeneous- that is, the dimensions on the left side 
of the equation must be the same as those in the right side, and all additive separate terms must have 
the same dimensions. 
To be specific, assume that for any physically meaningful equation involving n variables such as:

The dimensions of the variable on the left side of the equation must be equal to the dimensions of any 
term that stands by itself on the right hand side of the equal sine. It then follows that we can rearrange 
the equation into a set of dimensionless products so that:

The required number of pi terms is fewer than the number of original variables by r, where r is determined 
by the minimum number of reference dimensions required to describe the original list of variables. 
Usually, the basic reference dimensions required to describe the variables will be the basic dimensions 
M(Mass), L(Length) T(Time) and θ(Temperature). As an alternatives it is possible to use F(Force), L, 
T, and θ.

The following basic steps can be followed to obtain a set of dimensionless groups from an equation:
List and count the n variables involved in the problem. If any important variables are missing, dimensional 
analysis will fail.
1.	 List the dimensions of each variable according to
θ
MLT , or 
θ
FLT
.
2.	 Find j: initially guess j equal to the number of different dimensions present, and look for 
j variables which do not form a π product. If no luck, reduce j by 1 and look again. With 
practice, you will find j rapidly.
3.	 Select j scaling parameters which do not form a π product. 
4.	 Add a one dimensional variable to your j repeating variables and form a power product. 
Algebraically find the exponents which make the product dimensionless. Do this 
sequentially adding a new variable each time.
5.	 Write the final dimensionless functions, and check your work to make sure all pi groups are 
dimensionless.
We will use this procedure in the next two subsections to find the non-dimensional groupings for forced 
and natural convection respectively.

Forced convection 
In this case, the heat transfer coefficient h depends on the flow velocity u, characteristic length scale 
L, fluid conductivity k, viscosity μ, specific heat capacity cp and density ρ. These parameters and their 
dimensions are listed in Table 3.1 using the fundamental dimensions of M for mass, L for length, T for 
time and θ for temperature

The number of variables is 7 and th number of dimensions is four, so we will be able to get three non-
dimensional parameters. We choose a set of repeated variables containing the four dimensions such 
that they do not form a π group on their own. By inspection, we can see that the variables k,L, μ and  ρ 
cannot form a π because only the first one contains the dimension θ.
We then use this set of variables with one of the remaining variables one at a time to extract the non-
dimensional groupings.

It is worth mentioning that the combinations of non-dimensional groupings are not unique and one 
might get three different sets if the repeated variables used above were different. However, we intentionally 
chose a set that produces non-dimensional groups which are most widely used in the literature.
We will now give a physical interpretation of the three non-dimensional groups derived above:
N
K/ : This group is called the Nusselt number Nu. This represents the dimensionless heat transfer coefficient 
and can be thought of as the ratio of the heat transfer by convection to that of conduction through the 
fluid. A value of Nusselt number around 1 implies either convective effects are weak or not present. The 
local Nusselt number is usually termed Nux. If the average value is used over a surface, then the term 
L
u
N
 is used. 
µ
ρ
L
u
: This group is known as the Reynolds number Re. It represents the ratio of the inertia forces to 
the viscous forces in the fluid. Its value can give an indication of the state of the boundary layer and 
whether the flow is laminar, turbulent or in transition. Again here the local Reynolds number is termed 
Rex and the Reynolds number based on the length scale of the flow domain is termed ReL.
k

The Prandtl number Pr. This can be written as follows:

From which, we can se the Pr is the ratio of the momentum diffusivity (v) to the thermal diffusivity  
(α). It provides a measure of the relative effectiveness of the transport by diffusion of momentum and 
energy in the velocity and the thermal boundary layers respectively. For gasses Pr~1.0 and in this case 
momentum and energy transfer by diffusion are comparable. In liquid metals Pr << 1 and the energy 
diffusion rate is much greater than the momentum diffusion rate. For oils Pr >> 1 and the opposite is true.

From the above interpretation it follows that the Pr number affects the growth of the velocity and the

The constants C, a and b can be obtained either by experiments, numerical methods or from analytic

b are given as 0.644, 1/2 and 1/3 for laminar flow over a flat plate.

Forced Convection relations
In this section, we will present forced convection relations for various geometric situations encountered 
in engineering applications. These are either analytic or empirical relations (obtained from experiments. 
These will be supported by worked examples to help the student in understanding the application of 
these relations.
3.4.1	
Laminar flow over a flat plate
In the simple case of an isothermal flat plate, as mentioned earlier, analytical methods can be used to 
solve either the Navier-Stokes equations or the boundary layer approximation (section 3.2.5) for Nux. 
This then can be integrated to obtain an overall Nusselt number NuL for the total heat transfer from 
the plate. The derivation of the analytic solution for the boundary layer equations can be found in Long 
(1999). This leads to the following solutions:

Turbulent flow over a flat plate 
Transition from laminar to turbulent flow over a flat plate generally takes place at a Reynolds number of 
approximately 5 × 105. This value however can vary up to an order of magnitude either way dependent 
on the state of free stream turbulence and the smoothness of the plate. Figure 3.8 shows a schematic of 
the velocity profile near the wall for turbulent and laminar flow

Figure 0-8 Velocity profiles for laminar and turbulent flows
It is apparent that the velocity gradient is much steeper for turbulent flow. By inspecting Equation 3.8, 
it is clear that for the same temperature difference between the wall and the free stream flow, turbulent 
flow will produce a larger heat transfer coefficient. Physically, this can be explained by the fact that there 
is more mixing of the flow due to turbulent fluctuations leading to a higher heat transfer.
For a flat plate, the Universal shear stress relationship for the velocity profile can be used, which is also 
known as the one-seventh power law

To compute the average Nusselt number for turbulent flow, it should be taken into account the a proportion 
of the blade will have a laminar boundary layer followed by transition before the flow becomes turbulent. 
So ideally, the Nusselt number needs to be integrated along the wall taking into account the change in 
the nature of the boundary layer. This leads to the following formula for the average Nusselt number

Air at temperature 527oC and 1 bar pressure flows with a velocity of 10m/s over a flat plate 0.5m long. 
Estimate the cooling rate per unit width of the plate needed to maintain it at a surface temperature of 
27oC assuming the contribution of radiation contribution is negligible.
Solution:
The first step in to compute the heat transfer coefficient. This requires information allowing the

Laminar flow in pipes
In Section 3.2.4, we discussed the nature of the flow in pipes and distinguished between two types of 
fully developed pipe flow, laminar and turbulent. If the Reynolds number Red, based on the pipe diameter 
is less than about 2300, then the flow is laminar. For Reynolds number above 2300 the boundary layer 
developing at the entrance of the pipe undergoes transition and becomes turbulent leading to a fully 
developed turbulent flow.

Convection
For laminar pipe flow, the velocity and temperature profiles can be derived from the solution of the 
flow Naveir-Stokes equations or boundary layer approximations leading to the determination of the 
heat transfer coefficient. We will not go it detailed derivations here and the interested reader can refer 
to Long (1999)
In pipe flow, we seek to determine a heat transfer coefficient such that Newton’s law of cooling is 
formulated as:
)
(
m

T

−
=

(3.48)
Where 
sT  is the pipe-wall temperature and 
m
T  is the mean temperature in the fully developed profile 
in the pipe. The mean fluid temperature is used instead of the free stream temperature for external flow.
In a similar fashion to the average Nusselt number for a flat plate, we define the average Nusselt number 
for pipe flow as: 
N
G
K
1XG

 
, were d is the pipe diameter.
From the derivation of formulae for the average Nusselt number for laminar follow resulting from the 
solution of the flow equations, it turns out the the Nusselt number is constant, and does not depend on 
either the Reyonlds or Prandtl numbers so long as the Reynolds number is below 2300.
However, two different solutions are found depending on the physical situation. For constant heat flux 
pipe flow, the Nusselt number is given by (see Incropera and DeWitt 2002):

between entry and exit of the pipe (such as in heat exchangers), then the fluid properties need to be

Turbulent flow in pipes 
Determination of the heat transfer coefficient for turbulent pipe flow analytically is much more involved

Example 3.3
A concentric pipe heat exchanger is used to cool lubricating oil for a large diesel engine. The inner pipe 
of radius 30mm and has water flowing at a rate of 0.3 kg/s. The oil is flowing in the outer pipe, which 
has a radius of 50mm, at a rate of 0.15kg/s. Assuming fully developed flow in both inner and outer pipes, 
calculate the heat transfer coefficient for the water and oil sides respectively. Evaluate oil properties at 
80oC and water properties at 35oC.

Note that this is significantly lower than the water side heat transfer coefficient. If the pipe material is 
a good conductor, this then will be the limiting parameter in the heat exchange and to improve it, we 
need to increase the heat transfer coefficient. This for example can be done by for example increasing 
the flow velocity or reducing the outer diameter or both.

Natural convection
So far, we have discussed the process of heat convection in the presence of an external forcing condition, 
which we called forced convection. For example, fluid motion may be induced by a pump of a fan. 
On the other hand, if fluid motion is caused by buoyancy forces within the fluid, it results in what we 
call natural or free convection. Buoyancy is due to the combined presence of a fluid density gradient 
and body force which is proportional to density.

Convection
An example of heat transfer by natural convection is that resulting from the external surface of radiators 
of a central heating system or an electric heating element. In this case, as the surrounding fluid is 
heated, its density reduces. This results in this fluid rising and will be replaced by colder fluid from the 
surrounding resulting in a circulation loop as shown in Figure 1.2.
Generally speaking, natural convection velocities are much smaller than those associated with forced 
convection resulting in smaller heat transfer coefficients.
If ρ∞ is the density of the “undisturbed” cold fluid and ρ is the density of warmer fluid then the buoyancy 
force per unit volume F of fluid is: 
g

Where g is the acceleration due to gravity.
The variation of density with temperature is:

where β is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient (

between the two fluid regions. If we substitute for ρ∞ from Equation 3.54 into Equation 3.55 then the 
buoyancy force per unit volume of fluid is given as:

Therefore, in the case of natural convection, h could depend on a characteristic length L. A temperature

volumetric thermal expansion coefficient β of the fluid. β is usually grouped with g and ΔT as one term

This dimensionless group is the ratio of the buoyancy forces to the square of the viscous forces in the 
fluid. Its role in natural convection is similar to the role of the Reynolds number in forced convection. 
At high Gr numbers the buoyancy forces are large compared to the viscous forces which tend to hold 
the fluid particles together and thus convection can occur.
In natural convection, we are also likely to encounter what is known as the Rayleigh number which is

Summary
In this chapter, the concept of the thermal boundary layer has been introduced after discussing the 
laminar and turbulent boundary layer and transition process.
To enable the analysis of the complex convection phenomena, dimensional analysis was introduced, 
where the number of controlling parameters is reduced to fewer sets of non-dimensional groupings. 
The main non-dimensional numbers relevant to convection are:
• Reynolds Number, which is the ratio of inertia and viscous forces
• Prandtl Number, which is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity
• Grashof Number, which is the ratio of buoyancy to the square of the viscous forces.
• Nusselt Number, which is the ratio of conductive to convective thermal resistance
• Rayleigh Number, which is the ratio of thermal energy liberated by buoyancy to the energy 
dissipated by heat conduction and viscous drag.
Empirical relations were developed which express the heat transfer coefficient as a function of one or 
more of those non-dimensional groups. Engineering applications were introduced where these relations 
were used to compute the convective heat transfer coefficient.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Introduction
Heat transfer by thermal radiation, or infra red radiation, is a distinctly separate mechanism from 
convection and conduction. In particular, thermal radiation does not require any medium to transport 
thermal energy. So thermal radiation can travel through ‘empty’ space (like the heat reaching the earth’s 
surface from the sun). Thermal radiation is an electromagnetic phenomenon, which occurs as a result 
of a bodies absolute temperature. So, all bodies with a temperature greater than absolute zero experience 
radiative heat transfer. Thermal radiation occurs in the range of wavelengths 0.1 < λ < 100 μm (by way 
of comparison, visible light occupies the range 0.5 < λ < 1 μm). For solid surfaces, thermal radiation is 
absorbed and emitted within about 1μm of the surface. It is therefore a surface effect and the properties 
which govern absorption and emission of thermal radiation depend on the surface characteristics (a layer 
of paint or other coating can for example significantly change the radiative properties). In general thermal 
radiation has both directional (depends on the angle relative to the surface) and spectral (depends on 
the wavelength) dependence. However, in this book we shall consider surfaces to be diffuse (they emit 
equally in all directions) and consider only total emission (which is the thermal radiation emitted across 
the entire spectrum). A further concept is that of a black body, which absorbs all incident radiation, 
reflects none and emits the maximum possible.

Figure 4.1 shows the spectral (variation across the spectrum or with wavelength) distribution of energy 
for a black body at various given temperatures, T. This is know as the Plank distribution. Note, for a 
given wavelength, λ, the energy emitted increases with increasing temperature; the peak in the energy 
distribution shifts towards shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases; for objects at a high 
temperature a significant fraction of the emission occurs in the visible part of the spectrum. The curves 
in Figure 4.1 are generated from the relationship below derived by Planck from considerations of 
quantum-statistical thermodynamics:

Radiation
The units of emission, irradiation and radiosity are the same as a flux (W/m2). The magnitude of these 
fluxes depends not only on absolute temperature, but also a number of surface properties. These are:
the absorptivity, a 
the transmissivity, t 
and
the reflectivity, r

Kirchhoff’s law of radiation
By considering a number of small bodies in a large enclosure, in a state of thermal equilibrium with 
each other and with the enclosure, it can be shown that:
a = e
(4.9)
So, by knowing only e (from, say tabulated data), we also know a (a = e) and for an opaque solid t = 0, 
so r = 1 – e.

View factors and view factor algebra
Radiation analysis must take account of the fact that not all of one surface ‘sees’ all of another. This is 
characterised by the view factor (sometimes called the radiation configuration factor or shape factor)
The view factor, F, is defined as the fraction of radiation emitted from one surface that is incident upon 
another. It is usually given two subscripts, Fij, F12, Fab etc. The first subscript refers to the emitting 
surface the second the receiving surface. The mathematical definition of the view factors Fij and Fji are 
given by the expressions:

a comprehensive and useful source of view factor data.

Radiative Exchange Between a Number of Black Surfaces
There is no reflected component of radiation from a black surface (r = 0), the only energy to leave is 
by emission.
• Consider two radiatively black surfaces ‘i’ and ‘j’.
• The emission from surface i is σ Ti4, of which the fraction (Ai Fij) falls on surface j.
• Hence, the radiative heat transfer from i to j is: Qi-j = Ai Fij σ Ti4
• The emission from surface j is σ Tj4, of which the fraction (Aj Fji) falls on surface i.
• Hence, the radiative heat transfer from j to i is: Qj-i = Aj Fji σ Tj4
Since (reciprocity rule) Aj Fji = Ai Fij then the net radiation exchange between surface i and surface j is:
Qij = Qi-j – Qj-i = Ai Fij σ (Ti4 – Tj4)
(4.12)
This can be easily generalised to the case of N black surfaces, which form an enclosure, as:

Radiative Exchange Between a Number of Grey Surfaces
As shown in Figure 4.2, for a grey surface, the thermal radiation leaving the surface (the ‘radiosity’, 
J) comprises the reflected part of the radiation r G and the emission, eEb. Consider an enclosure 
formed from N separate grey surfaces at temperatures T1, T2, T3, …. TN. The respective areas are 
A1, A2, A3, …. AN, the respective emissivities are e1, e2, e3, …. eN, and so on. Note: the particular 
geometry under consideration may not actually be fully enclosed (two oposing plates for example), any 
openings can be modelled as a hypothetical surface, approximating to the radiative properties of the 
surrounds. The net radiation leaving surface ‘i’, Qi , is equal to the difference between what goes out (the 
radiosity) and what goes in (the irradiation), so:
Qi = Ai (Ji – Gi)
(4.14)
Also, and using Equation 4.8 for the definition of emissivity:
Ji = riGi + eiEb,i
(4.15)
and for t = 0 (opaque solid surface), r = (1-a) = (1 – e) [Kirchhoff Equation 4.9]
Ji = (1 – ei)Gi + eiEb

j = 1, 2, 3; i = 3, j = 1, 2, 3. This will result in N (i.e. 3) simultaneous equations for the radiosities J1, 
J2 and J3, which can be eliminated and providing some temperatures are known, the other unknown 
temperatures may be found as may be the various heat flows. The following example will illustrate the 
practical application of this technique as well as how to deal with convective heat transfer in addition 
to radiation.

Example 4.2
High temperature gas flows through the inside of a pipe of outer radius r2 = 30 mm. To reduce the 
thermal radiation from the pipe to an electrical control panel mounted nearby, a semi-circular radiation 
shield of radius r1 = 100 mm is placed concentrically around the pipe. Thermal radiation from the pipe 
is radiated to bothe the shield and the surroundings which are at 310 K. The radiation view factor from 
the shield to itself is F11 = 0.3345.
a)	 Obtain values for the remaining view factors
b)	 Consider a radiation balance on the system. The pipe temperature is 900 K; the shield 
temperature is T1; the emissivity of the inner surface of the shield is e1 = 0.8 and the 
emissivity of the outer surface of the pipe is e2 = 0.5. Assume the surroundings can be 
approximated by a black body at 310 K and neglecting any heat loss by convection, estimate 
the surface temperature of the shield when the emissivity of the outer surface of the 
radiation shield is e0 = 0.1
Figure 4.4 Radiation shield – Example 4.2
Figure 4.4 shows a cross-section through the pipe and radiation shield. A third, imaginary surface, 
Surface 3 is drawn to form the enclosure. The pipe and radiation shield are assumed to be long in relation 
to their diameters so it is a reasonable assumption to neglect radiation from the open ends.

Substituting F12 = 0.15 and F13 = 0.5 and with T3 = 310 K, σ = 56.7 × 10-9 W / m2 K4, this finally gives:
J1 = 4.877 × 10-8 T14 + 0.03226 J2 + 56.3 (W/m2)
Obviously this alone is insufficient to solve the problem, because we have three unknows J1, J2 and T1. 
A similar analysis must be carried out on Surface 2 (i.e. i = 2, j = 1,2,3).

J2 = 18731 + 0.25 J1 (W/m2)
Combining the above two equations to eliminate J2 gives
J1 = 4.9 × 10-8 T14 + 666 (W/m2)
However, we have one equation with two unknowns so we need to use a further relationship. This comes 
from applying a heat balance on the inner and outer surfaces of the radiation shield itself. For the inside

From which, with T3 = 310 K, gives the final result that
T1 = 522 K.
It is instructive to continue with this example to examine the effect on the surface temperature of the 
radiation shield if we increase the emissivity of its outer surface and decrease the emissivity of its inner 
surface. Qualitatively we would expect the surface temperature to be reduced because less radiation from 
the hot gas pipe is being absorbed by the shield. If we now make e0 = 0.8 and e1 = 0.1, then we obtain:
J1 = 8.112 × 10-9 T14 + 0.193 J2 + 347.6 (W/m2)
J2 = 18731 + 0.25 J1 (W/m2) which is the same as before because e1 is not involved in this equation.
When combined this gives
J1 = 8.534 × 10-9 T14 + 4163.5 (W/m2)
From then energy balance on the radiation shield
T1 = 465 K.
It is also useful to look at the effect of convective heat transfer, h, from the outer surface of the radiation 
shield. The energy balance on the outer surface of the shield becomes:

In determining what constitutes a surface it is necessary to recognise that these should be approximately 
isothermal. So, for example, in applying this technique to say a turbine disc where the temperature can 
vary significantly over the radius of the disc, it may be necessary to subdivide the disc into 10 or more 
sectors. This will of course result in a system of simultaneous equations that is no longer amenable to 
solving by hand and a computer matrix method will need to be used.

Summary
Heat transfer by thermal, or infra-red, radiation occurs as a result of an objects’ absolute temperature. 
It is an electromagnetic phenomenon which takes place in the range of wavelengths 0.1 < l < 100 mm. 
Therefore, and unlike conduction and convection, thermal radiation can propagate in the absence of 
any medium.
In addition to the thermal radiation emitted by an object, due to its temperature, thermal radiation may 
also be transmitted through a surface, reflected from it or absorbed into it. The physical properties known 
as emissivity, transmissivity, reflectivity and absorptivity determine the magnitude of these components. 
Values of these properties are easily obtained from tabulated data.
The idealised concept of a black body defines a perfect radiator and absorber. Real surfaces, which are 
termed “grey” emit and absorb less radiation than a black body. The radiation view factor determines the 
fraction of radiation leaving one surface that is incident upon another. For the general case, this results 
in a complex mathematical relationship. However, it is possible to simplify this for a limited number 
of geometries. For other more complex geometries the reader is referred to the catalogue produced by 
Howell (1982). View factor algebra is used to simplify the task of calculating all the view factors in a 
particular geometry.
A generalised method was developed for the analysis of grey body thermal radiative exchange in an 
enclosure. Most geometric configurations involving two or more surfaces can be made into an enclosure 
by the addition of an extra hypothetical surface that represents the surrounds.
Heat transfer by radiation always takes place when there is a temperature difference. Consequently, it is 
important to estimate the significance of the contribution of radiation compared with that for convection. 
In general, the heat flux by radiation will be significant in most free convection processes and in forced 
convection at high temperatures (for example, combustion).

Introduction
So far, we have studied the basic mechanisms for heat transfer. Various analytical and experimental 
correlations for the computation of the heat transfer were presented with numerous examples showing 
their application in engineering problems. 
In this chapter, we will use those correlations to describe the calculation procedure for heat transfer 
within widely used heat transfer devices, namely heat exchangers. Heat exchangers are thermal devices 
that transfer or exchange heat from one fluid stream to one or more others. It is a broad description to 
a vast range of hardware that operates in one of three ways:
1.	 By recuperation, or recovery, of heat from a hot stream to a cold stream;
2.	 by regeneration, as the hot and cold streams alternatively flow through a matrix;
3.	 by direct contact of one fluid stream with another.
The emphasis in this book will be on recuperative heat exchangers. These being by far the most common 
but this analysis can be extended to the other types.
Examples of these types:
Recuperation: Automotive radiators, oil coolers, power station condensers, economiser.
Regenerative: Rotating matrix used to preheat exhaust gases, Stirling Cycle engine
Direct contact: Cooling of hot metal sheet by a spray of water or air jet, cooling tower.
In recuperative heat exchangers, mixing and contamination is prevented by solid walls. The dominant 
mechanisms of heat transfer are illustrated in Figure 5.1:

Convection: wall → B
Radiation will be present as well, but in most cases (excluding combustion) it is safe to assume that this 
is also negligible.
There are at least two main objectives to the analysis of heat exchangers. The first is the design of a 
heat exchanger to fulfil a certain duty, providing geometric parameters. The second is the prediction of 
performance of a particular design working out inlet and outlet temperatures and heat flux.	
	
	
5.2	
Classification of Heat Exchangers
Heat Exchangers are classified either by flow arrangement, by construction or by their degree of 
compactness.
5.2.1	
Classification by flow arrangement 
In this classification, heat exchangers can be parallel flow, counter flow or cross flow as shown in Figure 
5.2. In parallel flow heat exchangers, both flows run side by side, for example in concentric pipes. Counter 
flow heat exchangers are similar except the cold and hot streams go in opposite directions. Cross flow 
heat exchangers have the two flow stream normal to one another.

The temperature distributions in a parallel and cross flow heat exchanger as a function of the coordinate 
along the heat exchanger are given in Figure 5.3. 
Figure 0-3 Temperature distribution in parallel and counter flow heat exchangers
It can be seen the exit temperature of the cold stream cannot by higher than the exit temperature of the 
hot stream for the parallel flow heat exchangers, while this is possible for counter flow heat exchangers.

Classification by construction
A double pipe heat exchanger has a relatively poor performance resulting in a very large physical size to 
perform a given duty consequently; they are rarely used in practical applications in this form. In practice, 
other arrangements are possible which allow reduction in the physical size of the heat exchanger. Examples 
are the U-tube bundle and the shell and tube heat exchangers shown in Figure 5.4

A shell and tube is a development of a double pipe heat exchanger. This is a common form of construction, 
cheap and robust. However it is very heavy. Internal baffles are used to force the outer stream to cross 
the tubes, improving convective heat transfer.

A typical example of cross flow heat exchangers is the plate-Plate-and-fin heat exchanger. In these types, 
flow channels are constructed from parallel plates separated by fins. Fins are used in both sides in gas 
to gas applications and on the gas side for gas to liquid applications such as automotive radiators. These 
can be either mixed or unmixed flow heat exchangers depending on whether the flow across the tubes 
is separated into various channels by plates or not. Typical cross flow heat exchangers are shown in 
Figure 5.5.
Figure 0-5 Examples of cross flow heat exchangers
5.2.3	
Classification by compactness
Another way of classifying heat exchangers is the degree of compactness. This is expressed as the ratio 
the surface area to volume. Compact heat exchangers are devices offering high surface area to volume 
ratio. This can be achieved in a number of ways. They tend to be used in gaseous, rather than liquid 
applications where the heat transfer coefficients are low. Examples of compact heat exchangers are shown 
in Figure 5.6. 
Figure 0-6 Examples of compact heat exchangers
5.3	
The overall heat transfer coefficient
The overall heat transfer coefficient U is defined in terms of the total thermal resistance to heat transfer 
between two fluids. This implies that the Heat Transfer Q, area A and appropriate temperature difference 
are linked by the expression:

The coefficient is determined by accounting for conduction and convection resistance between fluids 
separated by solid walls. In heat exchanger analysis in this chapter, we will assume that the radiation 
effects are negligible compared to convection effects. This is true for most heat exchangers encountered 
in practical applications.

Overall heat transfer coefficient for a straight wall

So the heat transfer coefficient is controlled by the lower of heat transfer coefficients. To illustrate this 
assume a water to air heat exchanger, where the air side heat transfer coefficient is 40 W/m2K and the 
water side is 1000 W/m2K:

Analysis of Heat Exchangers
There are two methods in use for the analysis of heat exchangers. The first is called the Log Mean 
Temperature Difference method (LMTD) and the second is called the Effectiveness – NTU method 
(Number of transfer Units) or simply the NTU method. In this book, we will explain and use the LMTD 
method. For the NTU method, the reader is referred to either Long (1999) or Incropera and DeWitt (2002). 
The heat transfer from one fluid stream to another can be written as:

Some mean temperature difference, which will be defined later. 
To determine

we will make the following assumptions:
• No external losses from the heat exchanger
• Negligible conduction along the tube length;
• Changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible
• h is constant along the length of the heat exchanger
• Specific heats are constant (not a function of temperature).
Consider a parallel flow heat exchanger with the temperature distribution as shown in Figure 5.9:

And we repeat the derivation; an identical expression is obtained for the LMTD as in Equations 5.38 
and 5.39. However, care should be taken when defining the temperature difference in Equations 5.40 
and 5.41 as opposed to those for parallel flow heat exchanger given in Equations 5.35 and 5.36.
Equations 5.38 and 5.39 can also be extended to other types of heat exchangers such as cross flow or 
shell and tube using a correction factor which is a function of two other dimensionless factors which 
are in turn defined empirically as follows:

R and P can be obtained from the empirical charts for various configurations. Figure 5.12 shows the

Figure 0-7: Correction factor F for a single-pass cross flow heat exchanger with both streams unmixed
Example 5.2
A concentric tube heat exchanger is used to cool lubricating oil for a large diesel engine. The inner tube 
is constructed of 2 mm wall thickness stainless steel, having k = 16 W/m K. The flow rate of cooling 
water through the inner tube (ri = 30mm) is 0.3 kg/s. The flow rate of oil through the tube (ro = 50mm) 
is 0.15 kg/s. Assume fully developed flow, if the oil cooler is to be used to cool oil from 90oC to 50oC 
using water available at 10oC, calculate:
The length of the tube required for parallel flow;
The length of the tube required for counterflow;
The area required for a single pass cross-flow heat exchanger with both streams umixed, operating at

Solution: 
The water temperature at exit is unknown. This can be computed from the overall energy balance for 
oil and water.

Heat Transfer

Heat Exchangers
Comment:
The counter flow heat exchanger has the smallest area and thus can be considered more efficient. However, 
both parallel and counter flow are very long and could be impractical for engineering applications. The 
cross flow might provide the area required in a shorter length, however, a shell and tube heat exchanger 
might be superior to the other three arrangements.
In the previous example, it was possible to work out the required information directly because three of 
the four inlet and outlet temperatures were known and the fourth could be computed from an energy 
balance. If only inlet temperatures were known, then this poses a difficulty to the design process. A 
method of overcoming this is illustrated in the following example:
Example 5.3
The double pipe heat exchanger of Example 5.2 is to be used to cool 0.15kg/s of oil at 90oC using 0.3kg/s 
of seawater at 10oC. The area of the heat exchanger is 11.5m2 and the overall heat transfer coefficient is 
21.9W/m2K. What are the exit states of oil and water from the heat exchanger?
Solution
To be able to calculate temperatures, an energy balance need to be performed. This requires knowledge 
of the overall heat transfer Q. This can be computed from the relation:

However,

 is not known so an iterative procedure needs to be followed. The steps are:
Assume a value of

Calculate

Calculate

From Q and the capacity rate, compute

solutions improves the rate of convergence).

Summary
In this Chapter, we discussed the main classifications of heat exchangers. The chapter then focused on 
the analysis for recuperation type. 
Recuperation heat exchangers were classified based on three criteria. The first is based on flow 
arrangement, where heat exchangers are classified to parallel flow, counter flow and cross flow. The 
second criterion was based on construction. Of these, we mentioned double pipe, U-tube and shell and 
tube heat exchangers. A third classification is that based on compactness where heat exchangers are 
classified according to volume to surface area ratio.
We then derived a formulation for the overall heat transfer coefficient for straight wall and circular 
pipe heat exchangers. The overall heat transfer coefficient takes into account the conductance in the 
two fluids and the metal separating them. The overall heat transfer coefficient U is defined such that 
the heat transfer is given by:

The final stage is to provide analysis of heat exchangers, were the Log Mean Temperature Difference 
(LMTD) method was used. This led to the formulation for 
m
T
∆
 which can be used in the above equation 
to calculate the heat transfer in a heat exchanger.
