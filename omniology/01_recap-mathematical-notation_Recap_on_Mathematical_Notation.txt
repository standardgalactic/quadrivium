Learning objectives
In this lecture we will...
• Revise the mathematical notation necessary to cover the 
basics of machine learning algorithms

Data to Products Specialization: Course 2: Design Thinking and Predictive Pipelines
Vectors and matrices
: vector – usually a vector of features
: a vector component, usually a single feature
: a vector of parameters
: matrix – usually a feature matrix
: feature vector for a specific datapoint
: transpose operator
: vector norm
(in general                             )
: a vector of labels

Linearity
We will frequently talk about linear 
models
Precisely speaking, a function f(x) is linear if
For the purposes of this class, we care about 
functions of the form:
which is linear in theta

Probability and statistics
: probability of some event
: conditional probability of some event
: mean of a vector
: variance of a vector
: sigmoid function
