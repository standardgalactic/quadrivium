PM’s 2010 Breakthrough Award winners include (counterclockwise, from main illustration by Jeremy Cook): the D series jet 
(designed to burn 70 percent less fuel than the Boeing 737); NASA’s LCROSS mission (conﬁrming water ice on the moon); 
and the Chevy Volt, which, along with the Nissan Leaf, is poised to usher in the era of the electric vehicle.

When we launched our 
ﬁrﬆ PoPular Mechanics 
iPad app this paﬆ July, 
we didn’t know quite 
what to expec. Well, 
thanks to an enthusias-
tic community of iPad 
owners—longtime Pm 
readers as well as 
newcomers to the 
magazine—it turned 
out to be a hit. our pilot 
interacive edition sold 
more than 40,000 
copies and got the beﬆ 
cuﬆomer reviews of 
any magazine app to 
date. Tat was 
particularly gratifying 
since we designed and 
programmed the app 
in-house: a ﬁtting 
approach for the classic 
DIy magazine.
now we’re going to 
do it every month. 
Starting with this issue, 
Pm goes monthly on 
the iPad. our november 
interacive edition 
contains everything the 
print original does— 
plus more. Inside we’ve 
packed video clips, 3D 
woodworking plans, 
photo galleries, 
interacive diagrams—
all the things people 
want to see in a digital 
edition. and we’ve 
redesigned every single 
page to make the moﬆ 
of the iPad screen. We 
think it is a fresh way to 
read, one that 
complements the print 
magazine that we take 
such pride in. 
In addition to the 
interacive edition, we 
also have a replica of 
the print edition 
available for both the 
iPad and the iPhone, 
through our partner 
Zinio. any way you 
choose to get your 
PoPular Mechanics, our 
commitment remains 
the same: authoritative 
reporting and pracical 
information, delivered in 
the cleareﬆ, moﬆ 
useful—and fun—way 
possible.

Teﬆing requirements for coal 
mines seem a bit muddled, as 
described in “Danger Below.” In 
the ’70s, the navy did not 
permit sailors to enter any void 
without teﬆing for an explosive 
atmosphere and available 
oxygen. Tese are operational 
teﬆs done with equipment 
known as an explosimeter. 
Today the tool is of cellphone 
dimensions. local police and 
ﬁre departments use it to 
determine explosive hazards.

CorreCtions: In the September 
issue, Tech Watch should have 
ﬆated the speed of the X-51A 
Waverider as 3800 miles per 
hour; the craf moves at 1700 
meters per second. 
Te Upgrade department 
should have identiﬁed the 
Dremel Trio as a corded 
power tool.
mileage vs Safety
In your article on the Automo-
tive X Prize (“Te X Facor”), I 
found it intereﬆing that the 
cars designed to achieve 100 
mpg are meant to be similar to 
the cars we drive today. Yet 
they missed an obvious feature 
of modern cars—safety. Would 
you allow your kids in one of 
these cars? If any were in an 
accident with anything larger 
than a bike, what would be the 
probability of surviving?
Will Vander Wal

I was psyched to read about 
the Automotive X Prize. Ten I 
noticed your DIY home ﬆory 
on gas-powered leaf blowers. 
It’s a little ironic that the issue 
discussed both the environ-
mental advantages of 100- 
mpg cars and air-polluting 
fans. Maybe people should juﬆ 
use a rake.

Forget petroleum-based 
Styrofoam peanuts. 
Ecovative Design uses 
fungus from mushroom 
roots, grown from 
agricultural waﬆe such as 
cotton seeds or wood pulp, 
to create a foam-like 
packing alternative. Te 
process uses one-eighth

Whipping paﬆ at a speed of 9 miles per second, the

roughly  
4.9 million 
barrels of 
oil—205.8 
million 
gallons—
spilled into 
the Gulf  
of Mexico 
from the 
runaway 
well drilled 
by BP’s 
Deepwater 
Horizon rig. 
About 95.6 
million 
gallons of 
gasoline 
could have 
been 
reﬁned 
from the 
amount 
lost. that 
equates to a 
whole lot of 
mileage.
Afer 14 months and 
8300 feet of drilling, an 
international team of 
scientiﬆs in Greenland 
ﬁnally hit bottom. Te 
team removed 3-inch-
diameter core samples 
that date to a period 
between ice ages, 
115,000 to 130,000 
years ago, when the 
Earth was as much as  
5 F warmer than it is 
today. Bubbles of air 
trapped in the ice will 
reveal how levels of 
greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere changed as 
global temperatures 
ﬂucuated.  — A.H.
1. Dusty Landslides 
Powder accumulated in 
craters looks like the result of 
landslides—surprising since 
the aﬆeroid’s gravity should 
be too weak to cause such 
acivity. Lutetia likely 
experienced an orbital 
irregularity or spin that 
generated the necessary 
force to move the powder.
2. Impact Divots 
Large dents in Lutetia’s side 
hint at the aﬆeroid’s violent 
hiﬆory. Scientiﬆs say these 
features indicate that Lutetia 
has been around 4.5 billion 
years—since the birth of the 
solar syﬆem—rather than 
breaking oﬀ more recently 
from a larger rock. 
3. Surface Grooves  
Long, parallel grooves on the 
surface may have been lef by 
rolling boulders or could 
represent sedimentary layers 
from an extraterreﬆrial 
process. Scientiﬆs are 
ﬆudying data from Rosetta’s 
sensors to determine how the 
aﬆeroid was formed and how 
the grooves were created.

Deadliest catch
When the crew of the E.S.S. Pursuit 
dredged the ocean 45 miles oﬀ Long 
Island, N.Y., they found more than the 
clams they sought: Tey caught 10 
artillery shells ﬆamped with dates 
from World War I. When one caniﬆer 
broke open, the contents —later 
identiﬁed as muﬆard gas—bliﬆered 
one man’s arm and leg, while other 
crew members suﬀered from eye and 
nose irritation. According to Army 
records, the government sank about 
32,000 tons of chemical agents, plus 
conventional weapons, oﬀ the U.S. 
coaﬆ between 1917 and 1970, when 
the pracice ﬆopped. “We don’t see a 
big inﬂuence on the surrounding

Hawaii’s Margo Edwards, who in 2010 
completed a comprehensive ﬆudy of

“But they’re continuing to deteriorate 
at an unknown rate. What happens 
later?” To be prepared, the Army this

discarded weapons from the seaﬂoor.  
Te ROV uses cameras and a laser

protec operators from contaminants.

DNA vs 
Disease
By 2012, the U.S. Army hopes to ﬁeld three 
unmanned reconnaissance airships capable of 
hovering at 20,000 feet for more than three weeks. 
Te Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicles 
(LEMVs), each the size of a football ﬁeld, will be 
developed by Northrop Grumman under a  
$517 million contrac. Te company eﬆimates the 
coﬆ of a three-week mission to be about $20,000—
far cheaper than comparable missions by conven-
tional aircraf. Another advantage: Airships can  
monitor large areas longer than ﬁxed-wing UAVs, 
which have to refuel and are ofen called away on 
other missions. Slated for teﬆ ﬂights next summer, 
LEMVs are part of a Pentagon procurement ﬆrategy 
of new lighter-than-air craf, including a radar blimp 
that can ﬆay alof for years at a time. — A.H.
Te gene that helps regulate a mosquito’s immune syﬆem is 
also linked to those that determine the insec’s life span. 
Researchers exploit this connecion to ﬁght malaria : Te 
parasite that causes the disease needs more than a week to 
geﬆate inside the insec, so shortening mosquitoes‘ two-week 
life span could further reduce human infecions. 
Scientiﬆs tag genetically 
modiﬁed mosquitoes by 
altering their eyes to 
become ﬂuorescent  
under ultraviolet light, as 
seen in this larva.
 esearchers have 
engineered mosquitoes 
that are 100 percent 
immune to Plasmodium, 
the primary single-cell 
organism that causes 
malaria in humans. 
University of Arizona 
entomologiﬆ Michael 
Riehle, collaborating with 
scientiﬆs at the 
University of California, 
Davis, booﬆs the insecs’ 
resiﬆance by introducing genetic 
material into mosquito eggs—which, 
in turn, prompts increased producion 
of an enzyme capable of warding oﬀ 
the parasite. Because the process 
involves altering only one DNA 
molecule in the insec’s genome, the 
outcome is easier to control. It’s also 
consiﬆent. “If even a single parasite 
can evade the killing syﬆem, it will 
result in an infecious mosquito that 
can transmit malaria to dozens of 
people,” Riehle says. Millions of 
mosquitoes would have to be released 
to spread the new gene, and there’s  
no way to know how it will funcion 
outside the lab. But because  
Plasmodium is becoming increasingly 
resiﬆant to drugs, transgenic 
mosquitoes could be an attracive 
gamble in places such as Africa, where 
pharmaceuticals are failing. Still, 
Riehle says, controlled teﬆing is 
needed to guard againﬆ unintended 
consequences. — BriAn resnick
engineers from yale and Princeton have 
published a gripping study of how paint 
dries. (No, really.) They injected ﬂuores-
cent tracer particles into paint, which they 
then coated onto a ﬂexible silicone rubber 
surface. The technique, called traction 
force microscopy, allowed them to observe 
the formation of microscopic cracks in 
real time by recording the movement of 
the tracer particles. The slight deforma-
tions in the soft rubber also created a 3D 
map of the mechanical stress that causes 
paint to peel. The research could inspire 
longer-lasting paint and improve other 
protective coatings. — Alex HutcHinson

The Hidden Physics

As Arcic Sea ice melts, an 
increasing number of cruise liners 
and commercial ﬁshing ships are 
able to navigate the waters around 
Alaska. Only moﬆ of the ﬆate’s 
north and weﬆ coaﬆs haven’t 
been mapped since the 1960s—if 
ever—so exiﬆing charts leave 
vessels vulnerable to hidden 
hazards. Te National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Adminiﬆration 
(NOAA) dispatched the survey ship 
Fairweather to spend two months 
mapping critical sea routes in the 
Bering Strait around Cape Prince 
of Wales. Te ship can proﬁle 
depth and topography of the 
seaﬂoor with a multibeam sonar 
and discern rock ﬁelds, ship-
wrecks and other obﬆrucions 
with a side-scan sonar. Tere are 
568,000 square nautical miles of 
U.S. Arcic waters, of which NOAA 
has identiﬁed 38,000 as high 
priorities to survey. Te agency 
says it will take more than 25 years 
to survey the priority sites. — A.H.

Prompted by privacy concerns, Google already blurs the face of anyone whose 
picure is captured by its Street View program. Still, many feel uncomfortable with 
their image appearing in the ubiquitous online maps. Searching for a solution, 
computer scientiﬆs at the University of California, San Diego, developed a 
program that makes people disappear from Google Street View data, ﬁlling in the 
missing pixels with images taken by Google’s vehicle-mounted cameras immedi-
ately before and afer the oﬀending shot. Te developers unveiled the program at 
a sofware conference over the summer, but challenges remain—like ﬁne-tuning 
the algorithm to avoid weird artifacs like a dog on a ﬂoating leash or a pair of

SFX makeup artiﬆ Greg 
Nicotero applies pros-
thetics on a zombie.
Zombies actually exist
 
For hundreds of years, 
when Caribbean shamans 
have wanted revenge—or 
needed a compliant 
workforce—they’ve given 
a person poison derived 
from the neurotoxin in 
pufferﬁsh. It paralyzes the 
victim and slows his heart 
until a pulse is undetect-
able. An antidote can 
revive him, but the toxin 
causes severe neural 
damage. “This explains a 
victim’s inability to run 
away,” says Neil White-
head, an anthropologist 
at the University of 
Wisconsin, Madison. It 
also explains pop 
culture’s depiction of 
zombies: glassy stares, 
dragging feet, incompre-
hensible noises. Key 
difference: Real zombies 
don’t eat brains. “George 
Romero’s great,” 
Whitehead says, “but not 
ethnologically accurate.”
Greg Nicotero sees zombies everywhere—even 
among the living. in fac, he can’t ﬆop pointing them 
out. “see this tall guy with the glasses?” he asks. 
“He’d be a great zombie.” Five minutes later, he’s at it 
again. “Tis girl has a long face, nice bone ﬆrucure. 
look at her forehead! Great zombie.”
it might seem macabre, but nicotero has a reason 
to look for potential ghouls: as the special-eﬀecs makeup supervisor on Te 
Walking Dead, a new television series about a group of humans trying to survive in 
the afermath of the zombie apocalypse, he’s tasked with bringing the show’s moﬆ 
gruesome characers to life. (Dead’s ﬁrﬆ season begins on aMC on oc. 31.) 
Te creation of the zombies ﬆarts with caﬆing. Te series is based on a graphic 
novel, and nicotero drew from its depicion of the undead to ﬁnd tall, slender acors 
with ideal bone ﬆrucure. “if you ﬆart with someone whose proportions are already 
thin, it feels organic and realiﬆic when you add proﬆhetics,” he says.   
For more involved looks, nicotero made molds of the acors’ heads and bodies 
and used them to create foam latex proﬆhetics that mimic rotting anatomy. For the 
simpler ones, he relied on partial facial proﬆhetics, dental plates that diﬆort the jaw 
and 3D proﬆhetic transfers that create wounds inﬆantly. Contacs and a tongue-
 blackening ﬆain completed the look. “Every person is a new canvas,” nicotero says. 
“you go, ‘What should i do with you today? i think i’ll tear part of your face oﬀ!’ ” 
Tings that can’t be done in-camera—removing an arm, for example—happen in 
poﬆ-producion. but even without those tweaks, the zombies look eerily real. “Moﬆ 
of the acors have never dealt with this level of proﬆhetics,” nicotero says. “Tey’ll 
say, ‘Can i touch that? How did you do that?’ ” — Erin Mccarthy

 While we’ve welcomed the recent transforma-
tion of digital SLRs into video-enabled cameras, 
it’s hard to get over the fac that these machines 
are, at their core, designed for ﬆill photography. 
Audio quality tends to be terrible, and if you don’t 
use a tripod, the cameras’ small size can lead to 
shaky images. Enter the  Sony NEX-VG10 
($2000),  a machine that merges the beﬆ 
elements of both SLRs and camcorders. Like an 
SLR, it has a large, high-quality image sensor and 
can accept interchangeable lenses (a ﬁrﬆ for 
consumer video cams). From the camcorder side 
of the family, it gets its generous, easy-to-handle 
body and a high-quality ﬆereo microphone.

Te practical 
Honda nT700v, 
which starts at 
$9999 ($10,999 
with AbS) is one 
sport-touring 
model that can be 
ridden daily. Its 
good-natured 
suspension damps 
out freeway 
irregularities with 
ease and the 
movable 
windscreen can  
be easily adjusted 
from the saddle.  
A 680-cc 
52-degree fuel- 
injected v-twin 
paired to a 
ﬁve-speed gearbox 
routes 60 hp to 
the rear wheel via 
a maintenance-
free shaf drive. 
Te transmission 
and clutch take 
little eﬀort to 
master, and thanks 
to the thrify 
v-twin, the 
nT700v delivers 
great economy; we 
got 51.8 mpg on  
a freeway cruise 
from the coast to 
the desert and 
back. Te fuel tank 
holds 5.2 gallons 
with a 0.9-gallon 
reserve—plenty for 
200 blissful miles.

From the back, the new 2011 Scion tC ($18,995) hatchback appears more 
aggressive than last year’s model: thicker C-pillars, more muscular fenders and  
a chiseled rear bumper cover. And yet that familiar unibody chassis is mostly 
unchanged. It’s a bit wider, thanks in part to the standard 18-inch wheels and 
225/45r18 tires. Steering is still rack-and-pinion, but the power assist switches 
to electric, and the ratio is quicker. Te tC’s new 2.5-liter engine is virtually 
identical to the four-cylinder engine in the 2010 Toyota Camry Se—all-aluminum 
with dual overhead cams, dual variable valve timing and a 10.4:1 compression 
ratio. With 180 hp and 173 lb-f of torque, Toyota/Scion claims a zero-to-60-mph 
time of 7.6 seconds for the six-speed manual version and 8.3 seconds for the 
automatic. As for eﬃciency, the ePA says that the 2011 tC will return 23/31 mpg 
(city/highway). — JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

You spent a lot of money on a new LCD ﬂat-screen 
TV, and now it’s time to install it. May sound easy, but 
testing the limits of your DIY abilities on hanging up 
your dream TV is enough to make any man nervous. 
Gillette’s Odor Shield Anti-Perspirant will keep you 
fresh, letting you feel conﬁdent while enjoying your 
new toy with others.
Gillette Odor Shield Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant 
traps and locks in odor as it occurs and uses  
Scent Enhancing Technology (SET) to turn odor  
into freshness. When used with Gillette’s Odor 
Shield Body Wash, you get 10x more odor  
protection coverage.*
HANGING A FLAT-SCREEN TV
 
First, determine where on the wall you want to 
hang your new ﬂat-screen tv. a piece of cardboard 
the size of your tv will help you ﬁnd and mark 
the location. next, you want to make sure there is 
access to the cords and power. if you want to hide 
the cords, drill one hole in the wall and one at the 
bottom or near an outlet.
 
Locate the studs with a stud ﬁnder and mark 
them with a pencil. as a general guide, tvs under 
80 lbs. and 40 in. can be mounted to a single stud. 
For anything bigger, use two studs. next, drill 
starter holes and screw the tv mounting brackets 
into the studs. make sure everything is level. 
Continue to follow the kit’s instructions to mount 
the bracket onto the tv.
 
With someone’s help, hang the ﬂat-screen tv  
on the wall mount. Connect the cables.
 
now the hard part! Walk away…and come back 
in an hour or so. You’ll have protected yourself with 
Gillette’s Odor shield anti-Perspirant so you’ll still 
be fresh, even after that long hour! if you don’t ﬁnd 
your tv on the ﬂoor, then your job was a success! 
Once you have conquered this task, you’ll be ready 
for the next one.

hen it comes to traversing great diﬆances at highway speeds, the diesel 
engine’s higher compression ratios and lean-burn combuﬆion provide an 
eﬃciency that no gas engine can currently match—at leaﬆ not without a 
major assiﬆ from an expensive hybrid syﬆem. Over the diesel’s operating 
range, the average thermodynamic eﬃciency—how much work the engine 
produces from the fuel—is in the mid 30 percent range, at leaﬆ 15 percent 
better than a gas engine. Not even close, right?
Te reality is that this lead is shrinking. As emissions regulations ﬆiﬀen, 
diesels are slowly losing their edge; the same pricey afer-treatment syﬆems 
that scrub diesel exhauﬆs also happen to crimp eﬃciency. Meanwhile, gas engines continue to improve. 
 “Tere is certainly a convergence in eﬃciency levels between gasoline and diesel engines,” says Uwe 
Grebe, GM’s direcor of global advanced engineering. “While diesels will always maintain a slight advantage, 
the gap will nearly close in as little as 10 years.”
Over the paﬆ decade, once-exotic eﬃciency-enhancing hardware such as variable camshaf timing, direc 
fuel injecion and turbochargers have become commonplace on spark-ignited engines. Certainly, these tech-
nologies aren’t new, but incremental improvements in elecronics and materials have pulled them into the 
mainﬆream. And there’s more on the way, like lean-burn combuﬆion and homogeneous charge compression 
ignition (HCCI), a gas-combuﬆion technology that blurs the line between gas and diesel engine cycles. Ricardo 
is working on a turbocharged engine that uses E85, a lofy compression ratio and high booﬆ levels to achieve 
diesel-like eﬃciency. Rod Beazley, Ricardo’s VP of spark-ignited engines, boaﬆs that “our ethanol-booﬆed 
concept engine achieves thermal eﬃciency in the low 40 percent range.”
But don’t expec the diesel engine to lie down and play dead. “We’ll continue to see incremental improve-
ments in diesel eﬃciency,” says Marc Trahan, Audi’s North American direcor of quality and technology. “It 
won’t be as large as going from sequential port fuel injecion to direc injecion, but there are ﬆill more 
gains to be made.” Trahan says these smaller gains will come from hardware such as variable valve timing 
and independent cylinder combuﬆion control, as well as improved afer-treatment syﬆems. 
Moreover, there are other facors in play. As GM’s Grebe points out, diesel fuel contains about 14 per-
cent more energy by volume than gasoline. Tis gives compression-ignition engines a signiﬁcant edge in 
fuel economy, as opposed to thermal eﬃciency. Of course, everything will change if and when spark-ignited 
engines switch to more energy-dense fuels. Tis race is far from over.

cars apart, but they are vastly different 
because Abner constantly tinkered 
with the car’s design and mechanics. 
They say this incessant re-engineering 
meant that each model cost over 
$55,000 to develop. At a time when a 
Model T sold for $260, the Doble cost 
about $20,000, which would be 
roughly  $250,000 today. And that was 
a big problem, even for what was, by 
1925, the best steam car on the road. 
Plus, Abner was doggedly pursuing 
steam propulsion when all signs 
pointed to the internal combustion 
engine as the powerplant of the 
future. He was, in effect, perfecting 
the VHS tape when DVDs had just 
been released. 
ne of my heroes was a guy named abner 
Doble, an engineering genius and a perfectionist, 
who built his ﬁrst steam car when he was in high 
school. Later, as an MIT student in 1911, Abner 
built a steamer with a condenser that turned vapor 
into reusable water; not even the Stanley Steamer 
had that range-extending feature. 
Some years later, Abner, with assistance from 
his three brothers, founded the Doble Steam 
Motors Corporation. But he was a much better 
engineer than businessman; his outﬁt built just 36 
cars from 1922 to 1931. I own two of them, both 
1925 Model Es. One is a sedan, chassis No. 18. The 
other car, a roadster with chassis No. 20, was once 
owned by Howard Hughes. My Dobles are only two

Abner could indulge himself 
because money wasn’t initially an 
issue. His grandfather made a fortune 
selling tools to gold miners and his 
father perfected a power-generating 
water turbine. Financial troubles, 
however, eventually dogged the com-
pany. The brothers bickered and sued 
each other. Abner was convicted and 
then acquitted on appeal in a stock 
manipulation scandal. I think he was 
a lot like Preston Tucker. He sincerely 
wanted to build a good car, but some 
of his practices were questionable. 
At least Doble’s customers got an 
incredibly sophisticated automobile 
for their money. Superheated steam 
from a 1200-psi front-mounted boiler 
drives a four-cylinder double- 
compound engine, which in turn 
powers the rear axle via a set of spur 
gears. The engine’s high- and low-
pressure cylinders reuse steam as it 
goes between the cylinder pairs, 
maxi mizing efﬁciency. There are also 
complex water and oil pumps, a pow-
erful 1-kilowatt electrical system to 
run the ¾-hp blower, pumps, lights 
and ignition, and a number of quartz 
rods that automatically regulate the 
steam temperature. 
Unlike a Stanley, where you need a 
match or some other ﬂame to ﬁre up 
the boiler, the Doble self-ignites. The 
starting process begins by turning the 
key and pulling up the ﬂoor-mounted 
water-pump knob. There’s a ticktick-
ticktick from the water pump as it 
pressurizes the coils and pushes out 
air bubbles, generating 300 to 500 psi 
in seconds. Push the water-pump 
knob back down, turn on the ignition: 
zzzzoooouuuuu! Now you have fire, 
which can be fed by a variety of fuels, 
usually kerosene. Tubes coiled inside 
the firebox hold about a gallon of 
water and provide a lot of surface area 
for quick heat transfer. That, com-
bined with about 2 million Btu of 
heat, quickly builds up steam, and 
you can pull away within a minute. 
Since the crankshaft drives the 
cools down. I’ve driven this car more 
miles than it’s been driven in many 
years, and it pulls away faster than 
you’d ever think possible in an 
85-year-old car. But its steering is slow 
and heavy. We’re trying different 
lubricants, and we think the steering 
box will loosen up. And like most cars 
of its era, it didn’t come with front 
brakes. I call the Doble’s binders the 
antistop brakes: They slow the car a 
little, but since there’s no engine 
braking, they’re scary. I’m going to 
install front brakes. 
The smoothness and force of the 
acceleration, however, never fail to 
amaze me—it’s like the Hand of  
God pushing you along. I was running 
at 85 mph the other day, and there 
was more to go. It’s dead silent on  
the road, just wooooooooshhhhhh!!! 
Back in the day, Hughes was clocked 
at 132.5 mph on a Texas highway, 
faster than anything with an internal 
combustion engine. It proves what 
I’ve always believed: The last days of 
an old technology are almost always 
better than the first days of a new 
technology.  
PM
rear wheels, there’s no transmission 
and therefore no shifting. Open the 
hand throttle and acceleration from a 
dead stop is smooth and continuous. 
The Doble just continues to pull all 
the way. It only has about 150 hp, but 
the torque output is huge: 2200 lb-ft 
at the rear wheels. If you’re on a hill, 
you just keep your ﬁnger on the throt-
tle lever and it holds the car right 
there. Once it’s up and cooking, the 
fuel is burned almost completely, like 
a propane torch, so when it’s running, 
visible emissions are minimal. Care 
and maintenance are very labor-
intensive, but as the owner’s manual 
states, “Your man can do that.”
My roadster came from the Nether-
cutt Collection in Sylmar, Calif. The 
late J.B. Nethercutt paid 10 guys for 
two years to restore it to exactly what 
Abner intended. I’d had my eye on it 
for 20 years. Dobles are like any other 
rare artwork. You say you’re inter-
ested, and decades go by. And you 
either get a phone call or you don’t. 
Hughes’s old car came very com-
plete, so there have been just a few ﬁt-
tings to replace. Dobles have to be 
surgically clean and airtight to elimi-
nate power losses through leaks; they 
need to hold a vacuum so the water 
returns to the boiler when everything

Workers search for trapped people in

was the perfect 
storm of bad

n the ﬆormy afernoon of May 2, 2009, 27 newly 
minted Dallas Cowboys were ﬁnishing a workout in 
the team’s indoor practice facility when the hanging 
lights 86 feet above them began swaying. On the side-
lines of the 83,000-square-foot ﬁeld house—a tent-
like steel-framed building with a tensioned fabric 
exterior—beat writers and photographers stopped 
watching the minicamp and stared at the fabric walls, 
which were snapping like a ﬂag in brisk winds. 
“I heard something long before I saw anything,” 
says photojournalist Arnold Payne. “It was this huge 
crash of metal and steel. You knew it was time to run. 
Just from the sound.”
It was the sound of a massive structural failure. 
Buckling under the winds, the facility’s western wall 
collapsed on top of the ﬁeld. The roof and eastern wall 
soon followed suit. As people dashed for the exits, the 
fabric covering fell, enveloping them in darkness. 
Most of the 70 inside the building managed to escape 
safely. But 12 people were injured, some seriously. 
The practice facility had been 
 erected in 2003 at the behest of new 
head coach Bill Parcells. Summit 
Structures, an Allentown, Pa.–based 
company owned by Canadian firm 
Cover-All Building Systems, put up a 
$4 million, 406-foot-long ﬁeld house 
over one of the ﬁelds at the Cowboys’ 
Valley Ranch campus. But in 2008, 
after the collapses of four similar Sum-
mit- or Cover-All-built facilities over a 
six-year period, the Cowboys requested 
structural reinforcements. Summit 
put in additional horizontal bracing, 
buttressed some critical structural 
points and re-covered the ﬁeld house 
in a new exterior fabric, all to make the 
building more robust. 
None of it worked. So who—or 
what—was to blame for the collapse?
First to weigh in was the  National 
Weather Service. Studying Doppler 
radar from May 2, it concluded that a 
phenomenon known as a microburst—
a localized, concentric wall of air capa-
ble of traveling at speeds of up to 150 
mph—was a major factor. But investi-

gators at the  National Institute of Stan-
dards and Technology (NIST) soon 
determined that weather wasn’t the 
sole culprit in the cave-in. “There was 
nothing unusual about this wind event 
in terms of its relationship to struc-
tural design,” says Fahim Sadek, who 
co-authored the NIST report. 
Investigators determined that the 
building, designed to withstand 
90-mph winds, broke apart in gusts 
between just 55 and 65 mph. In its ﬁnal 
report, published eight months after 
the collapse, NIST detailed a series of 
engineering failures—a progression of 
ﬂawed calculations, incorrect assump-
tions and unexplained deviations from 
original plans. Wind load, the force 
applied to an object by blowing wind, 
was calculated for an average building 
height of 60 feet; the structure actually 
had a mean height of 67 feet. As a 
result, the load on the building was 
more than double what Summit had 
assumed. Engineers also assumed that 
the building was “fully enclosed,” but 
it had vents and several large openings 
for doors, affecting internal pressure—
and wind resistance. 
When the facility was upgraded in 
2008, Summit calculated the new 
roof’s slope at 11 degrees; the actual 
slope was 21 degrees—so demands on 
the building were 68 percent  greater. 
And Summit assumed the building’s 
fabric covering provided lateral brac-
ing for the structure. NIST’s com puter 
models showed that it did not.  
The NIST report noted that tented 
structures like the ﬁeld house are rela-
W h at  W e n t  W r o n g / / / 
c o W b o y s ’  fa c i l i t y  c o l l a p s e
tively unregulated, and the practice of 
counting the fabric as lateral bracing 
is a point of disagreement among engi-
neers. Summit may not be around to 
weigh in on the debate: Cover-All, 
Summit’s parent, ﬁled for bankruptcy 
in March. (Attempts to contact Sum-
mit were unsuccessful.)
In the wake of the collapse, other 
organizations with similar structures, 
including Texas A&M and the Univer-
sity of New Mexico, had engineers eval-
uate the safety of their facilities. But 
it’s not known how many buildings of 
this type exist—or how many could be 
suffering from structural deﬁciencies. 
But the takeaway from this disaster is 
clear: Engineering errors and inclem-
ent weather can be a tragic combina-
tion. The Cowboys’ structure was built 
to fail; it just needed a good push. And 
on May 2, it got one.

ever before has technology advanced at such a blistering pace. And 
yet there’s a difference between the latest gadget and innovations 
that truly move society forward, whether that’s driving down the cost 
of solar power, proving the existence of water on the moon, design-

J. Craig Venter has worked with teams to sequence hundreds of genomes, including his own. In the future, he says, 
such genetic information will provide valuable insights into issues like aging and disease. 
Pioneering new   

6 3
enomics pioneer J. craig Venter admits 
he was a late bloomer. A halfhearted student (his 
8th-grade report card shows multiple C’s and D’s), 
he spent his 1950s childhood jumping freight cars 
in the rail yards of Millbrae, Calif. He dug backyard 
tunnels and waged make-believe battles, igniting 
model planes and melting toy soldiers with lighter 
ﬂuid and matches. As a teenager, Venter surprised his 
father by successfully building a hydroplane using plans 
clipped from Popular Mechanics, a project he describes 
today as “my earliest foray into some type of science.”
Yet Venter looks back on what some might call a misspent 
youth with pride. “I was able to fulﬁll my imagination,” he says, 
“and that is one of the best traits to carry into science.” 
 Discipline and a hunger for knowledge help, too—
qualities Venter honed while serving in the Viet-
nam War. As a medic, he says, “knowledge 
was essential. That’s why I was absolutely 
determined, even though I hated school, to 
go to college after I got out of the military.”
While working at the National Institutes 
of Health in the early 1990s, Venter grew 
impatient with the snail-like pace of gene 
identiﬁcation and developed a way to rapidly 
discover genes by exploiting snippets of DNA 
called expressed sequence tags. In 1992, he founded 
The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), and three 
years later, a TIGR team decoded the ﬁrst genome of a free-
living organism, the bacterium Haemophilus inﬂuenzae. 
That led to Venter’s best-known breakthrough, mapping 
the human genome. Last May, he wowed the world again by 
creating the ﬁrst synthetic cell. His ultimate goal is to design 
new organisms that will beneﬁt humanity. To that end, he has 
entered into a deal with Exxon Mobil to develop a biofuel 
alternative to petroleum. And he’s working with healthcare 
giant Novartis to produce more effective vaccines. 
When PM caught up with Venter, he was aboard his sail-
boat—Sorcerer II, moored in Ostia, Italy—preparing to join 
the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition for a monthlong Medi-
terranean journey. Unlike another famous scientist who sailed 
the seas collecting specimens, Venter was after an invisible 
quarry—microbes that would be shipped back to the J. Craig 
Venter Institute in Rockville, Md., for DNA sequencing.

and moved to Southern California to try to take up surﬁng as a 
vocation, but this was in 1964 and there was this nasty little 
thing called the Vietnam War. As a result, I got drafted. I 
 ended up in the Navy Medical Corps, and that was a rough 
education that totally changed my view of where I was going 
and how I was going to get there.
Q: Had you been interested in science up to that point?
I was such a horrible student, I ﬁgured my chances of ending 
up a scientist were pretty low. The Vietnam War totally turned 
my life around. Some people’s lives were eliminated or 
destroyed by the experience. I was one of the fortunate few 
who came out better off. 
Q: Why did you decide to pursue genetics?
Genetics didn’t come until much later in my career, when I 
was working as a biochemist. I had become a section chief 
and a lab chief at the National Institutes of Health. I had a 
large budget and could work on anything I wanted, so I 
stopped everything I was doing and taught myself and my lab 
how to do the new ﬁeld of molecular biology. It was clear 
those were the only tools to really make dramatic headway in 
the kind of science I was interested in. All the discoveries that 
I’m known for came shortly after that moment.
Q: Is it useful to think of cells as biological machines?
I use the term “machine” quite loosely. Biology is much more 
dynamic than the diesel engine here in my boat. Our parts are 
constantly being remade from our information system. I 
think that’s the most important thing for people to think 
about for the synthetic cell. It shows what life really is. The 
only reason you’re alive and I’m alive right now is that our 
DNA is being read in every one of our trillions of cells on a 
second-by-second basis, making new protein molecules to 
replace the ones that are 
decaying. It would be like 
having a self-repairing diesel 
engine: Every time there’s a 
little decay on the piston, it 
would repair itself. 
Q: What role do you think 
the federal government 
should play in promoting 
science and technology?
As I said, we’re a society 100 
percent dependent on sci-
ence for our future, so the 
government can’t just sit 
back and hope that some-
body will do something in 
the private sector. People in 
the government need to 
think intelligently about how 
to stimulate new areas. 
It ultimately will. Organisms in the ocean provide over 40 per-
cent of the oxygen we breathe, and they’re the major sink for 
capturing all the carbon dioxide we constantly release into 
the atmosphere. I’ve described the 40 million genes my team 
has discovered to date as design components for the future. 
When we’re designing organisms for the purposes of produc-
ing food and fuel and chemicals—all the things we need for 
daily life—those components get more and more important. 
Right now we’re at a primitive stage. There’s not a direct link 
between discoveries we’re making in the ocean and some-
thing we’re doing in the lab, but there’s certainly an intellec-
tual link to the future. 
Q: How might one of these future organisms function?
Our project with Exxon Mobil is to try to use algae cells that 
capture carbon dioxide and convert it to long-chain hydrocar-
bons—basically, creating a biocrude that can go into reﬁner-
ies to make gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. We’re talking about 
facilities that will have to be multiple square miles, producing 
billions of gallons a year, to have any effect at all. Those are 
huge challenges. The research program is to push the science 
and engineering. If that works, it could have a huge impact. 
Q: Did this desire to ﬁnd new and useful technology also 
inspire your quest to create synthetic life?
No, that began by asking incredibly basic questions about 
life: What is the minimal life form you could have for a self-
replicating organism? We decided the only way we could 
answer that was to make a chromosome synthetically, so we 
could alter the gene content to get down to what would be the 
minimal gene set for life. Having a clear deﬁnition of which 
genes are essential is going to be important for future design 
projects. As the population goes from 6.8 billion people to 
more than 9 billion over the 
next 40 years, we’re going to 
need a lot more food, clean 
water, medicine and fuel to 
power all these things. We’re 
now a society that’s 100 per-
cent dependent on science 
for our survival. It’s not a 
gentleman’s sport. We think 
this is one of the most power-
ful tools—at least on the biol-
ogy side—that we can apply 
to all these critical needs. 
Q: How did a former surf 
bum, as some have called 
you, make the transition to 
genomics pioneer? 
I’m not sure I was ever a surf 
bum! I was a surf bum wan-
nabe. I left home at age 17

Things like putting a tax on carbon so that renewable fuels 
are an option and working on diseases that are below the 
radar of the pharmaceutical industry.  
Q: Some people contend that genes from living organisms 
aren’t inventions and therefore cannot be patented. How do 
you feel about that?
We’re a country of laws and rules, and the Supreme Court has 
ruled that life forms are patentable entities. Intellectual prop-
erty is a key aspect for economic development. Something has 
to drive investment. We have investors putting up tens of mil-
lions of dollars—in the case of Exxon, $300 million—and they 
need to know that they won’t lose that money because some-
body else owns the intellectual property. 
Q: Do you plan to patent your synthetic cell?
We’ve been patenting all the new tools we’ve developed along 
the way. The synthetic cell has no commercial value itself—
it’s just proving that something is possible. Patents are basi-
cally rights to try and develop a commercial product. It’s a 
contract that our government makes with its citizen inventors 
that encourages them to publish and disseminate informa-
tion about their inventions so that other people can get to the 
next stage. People equate patents with secrecy; that secrecy is 
what patents were designed to overcome. That’s why the for-
mula for Coca-Cola was never patented. They kept it as a trade 
secret, and they’ve outlasted patent laws by 80 years or more.
Q: How do you feel about the pace of genomics-based 
personalized medicine since your team ﬁrst sequenced the 
human genome 10 years ago?
It’s been moving substantially slower than I like to see things 
move. Not much happened with government funding in the 
decade that followed. Private industry has invested a tremen-
dous amount, and there are some pretty exciting new technolo-
gies. In fact, it’s amazing something that cost $3 billion to 
$5 billion a decade ago can now be done by an individual scien-
tist using a single machine in a very short period of time. 
Q: So you’re optimistic about the next 10 years?
We have 100 trillion human cells, along with 200 
trillion microbes associated with us. That’s a lot of 
complexity to sort out. I don’t want to underesti-
mate the scope of the problem—of understanding 
all this information and have it affect our under-
standing of human disease. It’s a huge challenge. 
Q: One ﬁnal question: Did your hydroplane work?
Absolutely! It was an 8-foot hydroplane with pon-
toons. Because I had no money, I built it totally 
with hand tools out of marine plywood. I was given 
a junked 1948 outboard motor. I had to learn how 
outboard motors worked by taking it apart and 
rebuilding it from scratch. I took it out on the San 
Francisco Bay, got it up to 25 or 30 miles per hour. 
It was a real thrill.
2000 President Bill Clinton declares a tie in the 
race to map the human genome, giving credit to both 
Venter and his publicly funded rival, Francis Collins. 
Far from being ﬁnished, Venter considers it “the 
starting line” for the future of medicine.
2001 The Institute for Genomic Research, founded 
by Venter, helps sequence the genome of the anthrax 
strain mailed in the attacks that killed ﬁve people— 
evidence that eventually leads the FBI to the source. 
2004 Sorcerer II, Venter’s 95-foot sailboat,  
leaves Halifax, Nova Scotia, on a two-year circum-
navigation of the globe in search of new microbial 
species for DNA sequencing. 
2005 Venter starts the for-proﬁt Synthetic 
Genomics Inc. (SGI) to work on solving global problems, 
such as fossil-fuel dependence, environmental 
degradation and disease epidemics. 
2007 He establishes another ﬁrst by mapping the 
6-billion-letter code of his own “diploid” genome (DNA 
from both chromosome pairs, one from each parent), 
discovering a genetic predisposition for blue eyes, 
antisocial behavior and heart disease.
2008 Using a computer code and four bottles of 
chemicals, Venter’s lab creates the largest man-made 
DNA structure by synthesizing and assembling the 
582,970-base-pair genome of a bacterium. 
2009 He announces SGI will receive $300 million 
from Exxon Mobil to engineer algae cells that turn 
sunlight and carbon dioxide into biofuel.
2010 Venter’s team uses a synthetic genome to boot 
up the world’s ﬁrst man-made bacterial cell. Mycoplasma 
mycoides JCVI-syn1.0 becomes the ﬁrst living organism 
to have its own website encoded in its chromosomes.

More-Aﬀordable Solar
Innovators: Harry Atwater, Michael Kelzenberg, 
Nathan Lewis, California Institute of Technology
Brilliant Idea: A solar cell that requires only a 
fraction of the silicon used in standard PV.
Chemist Harry Atwater’s gift for manipulating 
light has led to some eye-opening innova-
tions, including an “invisibility cloak.” His 
most recent feat: reinventing the solar cell. 
More than half of the silicon acting as a 
semiconductor in standard photovoltaic (PV) 
panels—made of wafers—winds up as shav-
ings on the factory floor. Atwater’s team at 
Caltech wastes virtually nothing, instead grow-
ing silicon microwires using vapor deposition. 
(Picture a tiny bed of nails growing out of a 
cloud of silicon-rich gas.) Researchers coat the 
microwires with a light-absorbing material, 
then embed them, along with light-scattering 
particles, in a clear polymer that has a reﬂec-
tive backing. As light pours in, it bounces 
around until 90 percent has been absorbed. 
The wire arrays require only 1 percent of 
the silicon—which accounts for roughly half 
of the manufacturing costs—of standard PV. 
The ﬁrst tests of the technology at scale con-
verted light into electricity at a rate of 8 per-
cent, which the team is convinced it can 
double (standard PV has 20 percent effi-
ciency). Plus, the cells are ﬂexible enough to 
be applied to roof shingles or curtain walls. 
“They have the photovoltaic properties of 
conventional solar cells but the mechanical 
properties of a plastic bag,” Atwater says.

It’s hard to decide what’s more 
impressive: the conﬁrmation of 
water ice on the moon, or the 
scrappy way that a team of 
scientists and engineers pulled 
oﬀ the mission—by slamming  
2 tons of equipment otherwise 
destined to become space junk 
into the moon’s south pole and 
then analyzing the dust plume 
it kicked up. 
Yet the Lunar Crater 
Observation and Sensing 
Satellite, or LCROSS, mission 
began as an aferthought. 
When the leaders of NASA’s 
$491 million Lunar Reconnais-
sance Orbiter (LRO) found 
themselves with an extra 1000 
kilograms of payload capacity, 
they sent out a call for 
shoestring proposals for a 
companion mission. Led by 
principal investigator Anthony 
Colaprete, a team from NASA’s 
Ames Research Center 
proposed using the Atlas V 
launch rocket’s empty upper 
fuel stage to impact the moon. 
Northrop Grumman would turn 
the rocket’s hot-tub-size 
payload ring into a makeshif 
spacecraf that would trail in 
the stage’s path, gathering data 
via instruments bolted to its 
six satellite ports.
The team came in under its 
$80 million budget—and the 
mission was a headline-
screaming success. Essentially, 
says Colaprete, “we reached 
out and touched the water.” 
The spacecraf calculated a  
4 percent moisture concentra-
tion in the plume, double that 
of the Sahara. “We take that for 
granted here on Earth, but 1 to 
2 percent water on the moon  
or an asteroid is potentially a 
lifeline,” he says. “From an 
exploration standpoint, we 
realize there are a wealth of 
resources that we can take 
advantage of. Suddenly, the 
moon is a more interesting and 
active place.”

Cellphone-Enabled Healthcare
Aydogan Ozcan hopes to make microscope lenses obsolete. “Microscopes are 
analog technology,” says the 31-year-old electrical engineer. Bulky and expen-
sive, they rely on ﬁnely polished curved glass to refract and focus light. By hack-
ing a cellphone’s software to perform the same function, Ozcan has brought 
an invention with Renaissance-era origins into the 21st century. 
Ozcan’s cellphone microscope focuses LED light on a slide positioned over 
the camera’s image sensor. The sensor converts light bouncing off and around 
a sample of, say, blood cells into electrons and records them as a digital holo-
gram. Image-processing software analyzes the hologram once it’s uploaded to 
a computer. One application, which will be field-tested in Brazil this year, 
identifies red blood cells misshaped by the malaria parasite—the same thing a 
technician searches for using a standard microscope. Unlike a scan by a trained 
human eye, however, software analysis is instantaneous. Future apps could 
screen for disease-causing parasites in drinking water and help monitor the 
health of HIV patients by counting T-cell levels in their blood.   
“The key to everything is the cellphone,” Ozcan says. In 1990, fewer than 
12.5 million people worldwide had them; today, 4.6 billion do. While conven-
tional lens-based microscopy has essentially plateaued, ﬁerce competition 
causes cellphone-camera technology to advance rapidly even as prices plum-
met. Eventually, Ozcan believes, point-of-care facilities in the U.S. will begin 
replacing expensive and time-consuming lab procedures with cellphone-based 
diagnostic tools. “Once insurance companies start to accept this,” he says, “we 
will have better, more affordable healthcare and better quality of life.” 
Innovator: Aydogan Ozcan, University of California, Los Angeles 
Brilliant Idea: A cellphone microscope that can diagnose disease cheaply and eﬀectively 
anywhere in the world.

and oﬃce towers survive severe

civil and environmental 
engineer. A team Deierlein led 
with Jerry Hajjar, a Northeast-
ern University engineer, hopes 
to change that, designing a 
system that protects both 
people and the structures they 
live and work in. 
Last fall, the engineers 
successfully tested a 26- 
foot-tall, three-story, steel-
frame building outﬁtted with 
the new system, built atop the 
E-Defense shake table—the 
world’s largest earthquake 
simulator—in Miki City, Japan. 
Steel “fuses,” not structural 
elements, absorbed the shock 
of an earthquake greater than 
magnitude 7, and cables pulled 
the building back into plumb 
once the shaking stopped. 
Afer an earthquake of that 
scale, the deformed fuses could 
be replaced in about four 
days—while the building 
remained occupied. Jim Malley 
of the San Francisco ﬁrm 
Degenkolb Engineers calls the 
system the next step in the 
evolution of green building. 
“As structural engineers,” he 
says, “our sustainable design is 
the ability not to have to tear 
buildings down afer earth-
quakes, but to use them for 
hundreds of years.”
For decades, the goal of seismic 
engineers has seemed straight-
forward: Prevent building 
collapse. And so they add steel 
braces to a skyscraper’s 
skeleton or beeﬁer rebar to 
concrete shear walls. Afer 
absorbing the brunt of seismic 
shaking, however, the compro-
mised structures ofen must be 
demolished. “The building, in a 
sense, sacriﬁces itself to save 
the occupants,” says Gregory 
Deierlein, a Stanford University 
A steel frame situated around a 
building’s core or along exterior 
walls offers structural support. The 
frame’s columns, however, are free 
to rock up and down within steel 
shoes secured at the base.
Elastic high-strength steel cables 
run down the center of the system’s 
frame. The cables control the 
rocking of the building and, when 
the earthquake is over, pull it back 
into proper alignment.
Steel fuses (in blue) at the frame’s center twist and contort to absorb 
seismic energy. Like electrical fuses, when they “blow out” they can be 
replaced, restoring the structural system to pre-earthquake conditions.

Curing Cancer 
Painlessly
Innovators: Karen Brewer, 
Brenda Winkel, Virginia Tech; 
Roger Dumoulin-White, Theralase 
Technologies 
Brilliant Idea: Light-activated 
compounds that cause deep-
seated, fast-growing cancer cells 
to self-destruct.
Two Virginia Tech scientists may have 
 invented the future of cancer treatment—a 
way to eradicate tumors without the harmful 
side effects of chemotherapy, radiation or a 
surgeon’s scalpel. They’ve built what chemist 
Karen Brewer calls a “molecular machine” 
that seeks out fast-replicating cancer cells and 
becomes lethal only when exposed to light.
Other photodynamic therapies rely on 
drugs that grab oxygen molecules from nearby 
tissue, so they are powerless against dense, 
fast-growing cancers—such as breast, brain, 
lung and prostate—with hypoxic, or oxygen-
free, cores. “I really wanted to come up with 
something completely different, a light-acti-
vated drug that would not require oxygen,” says 
Brewer, an expert at building light- triggered 
on/off switches for chemical compounds. Biol-
ogist Brenda Winkel helped develop a DNA-
targeting compound to attach to the trigger. 
Then, Toronto-based Theralase Technologies 
licensed it for use with its own deep-penetrating 
super-pulsed laser. “This shows promise in 
terms of getting deeper-seated tissue,” says 
National Cancer Institute program manager 
Rosemary Wong. “It would allow you to address 
a number of different cancers.” 
The new therapy has recently begun Phase 
II trials, part of a  seven-year road map for Food 
and Drug Administration approval. “Cancer is 
really just cells that have lost the ability to die,” 
says Theralase president Roger Dumoulin-
White. “With the help of a compound and a 
light source, we’re granting that cell the ability 
to bow out gracefully. We’re fixing what’s 
 really broken versus trying to cut it out.”
By combining the expertise of their respective labs, chemist Karen Brewer (left) 
and biologist Brenda Winkel created a cancer-ﬁghting “supramolecule” 
composed of three smaller molecules: One binds to the DNA of cancer cells, a 
second absorbs light, and a third delivers a drug that cleaves the DNA.

Small-scale, hand-cranked generators that power lights and radios are practical in 
places where there’s no electricity. But they’re not a whole lot of fun. Four undergradu-
ate students at Harvard University decided to harvest the kinetic energy of soccer, the 
world’s most popular sport, instead. Afer just 15 minutes of play, their sOccket ball 
could provide families in sub-Saharan Africa—where less than 25 percent of the 
population has access to reliable electricity—with 3 hours of LED light, a clean, eﬃcient 
alternative to kerosene lamps.
The mechanics are straightforward: When the sOccket rolls, a magnetic slug slides 
back and forth inside an inductive coil in the ball, generating power that is stored in a 
capacitor. Field-tested in South Africa during the World Cup, sOccket 2.0 has an 
embedded DC jack and weighs only 5 ounces more than a FIFA-regulated ball. A future 
version should hold enough juice—3.7 volts at a capacity of 600 milliamps per hour—to 
charge a basic cellphone. The women partnered with a manufacturer in Cape Town and 
hope to subsidize developing-world discounts with sales in the U.S.

the airline industry grow and, 
at worst, remain neutral in its

asks project manager Ruben 
Del Rosario of NASA’s Glenn

Boeing’s 737 is the best-selling 
jet airliner in history: Today, it 
carries 29 percent of all U.S. 
domestic air traﬃc and is 
responsible for 25 percent  
of the industry’s fuel use. A 
reinvention of this commercial 
workhorse, called the D series, 
could burn 70 percent less fuel, 
emit 75 percent less nitrogen 
oxide and dampen noise from 
takeoffs and landings. In 
short, it could transform air 
travel into a more environmen-
tally benign practice.

The engines sit at the top rear of the fuselage, where they draw in 
slower-moving air that passes over the plane, using less fuel for the same

mitigate the engine stress this creates, the plane would travel about  
10 percent slower than a 737; the researchers anticipate making up this 
time through quicker loading and unloading via the plane’s second aisle.

Redeﬁning Magnetism
Larry Fullerton set out to invent a self-assembling magnetic toy that would fuel his 
grandchildren’s passion for science. Instead, he invented a way to manipulate mag-
netic ﬁelds that redeﬁnes one of the fundamental forces of nature. 
fullerton’s breakthrough tramples the long-held assumption that magnets have two 
opposing poles, one on each side. He found that if he used heat to erase a magnetic 
field, he could then reprogram material to have multiple north and south poles of 
differing strengths. “People look at magnets as having a north pole and a south pole. 
That limits your thinking,” he says. “I came along from the ﬁeld of radar and said, 
‘Hey, that’s not a magnet—it’s a vector ﬁeld!’” 
To program the magnets, Fullerton invented a device—picture a printer whose 
head emits 200,000-amp bursts of electricity rather than ink—that creates magnetic 
pixels he calls “maxels.” Using the printer and some vector math, Fullerton is now 
learning how to produce magnets that exhibit different behaviors. The practical 
applications appear limitless: from precision switches and a new generation of fas-
teners to robots that can scale walls without touching them.

world to receive the Argus II artiﬁcial retina. 
In a healthy human eye, 125 million photoreceptors at the 
back of the retina act like the world’s most sophisticated digi-
tal camera, functioning in a range of light conditions sepa-
rated by 10 to 12 orders of magnitude. For example, when 
navigating through the woods on a moonless night, the eye’s 
rods can pick up a single photon, damping the “noise” of sur-
rounding cells in order to amplify it. And when gazing down 
the beach on a dazzling summer day, the eye’s color-sensitive 
cones rapidly adapt to a ﬂood of sunlight. Barbara has retini-
tis pigmentosa, a disease caused by any one of 100 different 
gene defects that trigger the deterioration of those photo-
receptors and interrupt the complex sequence of image 
processing that follows.
“My sixth grade teacher ﬁrst noticed it,” Barbara 
tells me—as a child, she had trouble ﬁlling in the 
bubbles next to answers on standardized tests. 
“I don’t think either of my parents really under-
stood what it meant. Every few years it would 
get a little worse and a little worse and a little 
worse.” In her 30s, Barbara ﬁnally started 
using a white cane—but only after she’d 
 fallen down an open manhole. You tripped 
over it? I asked. “No, I went into it. There 
was a ladder so I was able to climb out,” she 
says. “It was right next to a restaurant that 
had tables on the sidewalk. Everybody was 
like, Oh my God, she just went down the 
hole! They thought I just wasn’t paying 
attention.” She gets around the city per-
fectly well now—she took two subways and 
walked several blocks to meet me at the 
restaurant—but when she learned about 
the Argus II clinical trial, she enthusiasti-
cally applied. 
In the morning, a surgeon at NewYork-
Presbyterian Hospital will make an incision 
in Barbara’s left eye and lift the saran-wrap-
like membrane that covers it, called the 
conjunctiva. He’ll then suture a small elec-
tronics package, about the size of a watch 
battery, to the outside wall of the eye and 
secure it with a piece of silicone rubber that 
wraps around the eye’s equator. Next, he’ll 
thread a thin cable through an incision in 
the wall; the cable connects the electronics 
to an array of 60 electrodes. After removing 
the vitreous humor that ﬁlls the inside of 
the eye—a material that’s essentially Jell-O, 
minus the sugar and food coloring—the 
surgeon reﬁlls the eye with ﬂuid so that he 
can manipulate the array onto the retina, 
tacking it in place with what is perhaps the 
world’s tiniest pushpin. The whole proce-
dure will take 4 to 5 hours. 
Barbara seems unperturbed. In fact, she’s 
Mark Humayun’s grandmother lost her vision, changing 
the course of his career. “I ended up going into ophthal-
mology to do this project, to restore sight to the blind.”
arbara Campbell is  
going to see Waiting for Godot. A lifelong New York City resident, she loves the 
theater and has been attending Broadway shows for nearly 40 years, ever since 
she was a teenager growing up in Queens. During that time, her vision has 
steadily deteriorated. At ﬁrst, she could distinguish the actors onstage with-
out a problem. Then, the details began to blur, so she started using a small 
telescope to see their faces. Eventually, about 10 years ago, she realized that a 
production of Fosse had faded into a solid whitish blur, which is all she sees 
when she’s facing a stage or walking up a street or getting a plate of fettuccine 
at an Italian restaurant, as she is now. 
“This looks delicious!” Barbara says, in an unmistakable New York accent, 
as the waiter sets her food on the table. Barbara, now 57, still thinks and talks 
in the language of the sighted, which is important for the clinical trial she’s 
about to embark on tomorrow. She needs to be able to articulate exactly what 
she’s seeing, if she sees anything, once she becomes the 25th person in the

looking forward to it. As a rehabilitation counselor for the New 
York State  Commission for the Blind, she understands the arti-
ﬁcial  retina won’t magically give her perfect eyesight. But what 
it will do is astounding nonetheless: send electric pulses that 
bypass the retina’s damaged rods and cones to jump-start cells 
that are still viable. The eye, after all, is a small, delicate organ. 
It’s warm and salty—a corrosive environment—and its tissue is 
extremely sensitive to temperature variation. Plus, the eye 
moves, and it moves briskly. Successfully implanting complex, 
wireless, biocompatible electronics in the eye is an extraordi-
nary achievement. Bringing even rudimentary vision to some-
one who’s completely blind is historic.
“I really have nothing to lose,” Barbara says, looking 
 slightly above and beyond my right shoulder. She leans for-
ward and feels for the edge of her plate. We’ve met only 20 
minutes ago, but she offers me some of her pasta, which I 
readily accept—it is delicious. “I feel I’m very prepared for 
this,” she says matter-of-factly. “I understand I’m not going to 
be seeing with my eye, I’m going to be seeing with electronics. 
There’s no way it will look like whatever I saw before.”  
The Argus II implant that Barbara will be receiving is the 
second generation of the device; the ﬁrst had only 16 elec-
trodes. Information gleaned from this clinical trial will be 
used to improve the 60-electrode version, which will be com-
mercialized, ﬁrst in Europe, as early as December. But even as 
the trial continues, a much larger effort, involving six national 
labs, four universities and a commercial partner, Second 
Sight Medical Products, is developing technologies that will 
enable third- and fourth-generation models using as many as 
1024 electrodes—which could provide enough detail to read 
24-point font and recognize faces. There are 100,000 people 
in the U.S. with retinitis pigmentosa and 10 million with 
degenerative retinal diseases. “I’m optimistic,” Barbara tells 
me. “Whatever happens, somebody will beneﬁt.”  
Two weeks laTer, I meeT BarBara In fronT of her 
apartment on New York’s Upper East Side. We’re traveling 
together to her ﬁrst weekly appointment at Lighthouse Inter-
national, a nonproﬁt that conducts research to beneﬁt people 
with low vision. On the train, she tells me the surgery was 
long, but painless, and that the doctors seem pleased. As we 
emerge from the station, I pause, uncertain. “Bloomingdale’s 
should be behind us,” she says. “Pottery Barn is on the right. 
Lighthouse is about a third of the way up the street.” 
The main goal of today’s appointment is to conﬁrm which 
of the array’s electrodes are working properly. Inside the 
dimmed ofﬁce, a Second Sight technician hands Barbara a 
battery-powered microprocessor about the size and heft of a 
ﬁrst-generation iPod. It will take information from a camera 
mounted on sunglasses and convert it to a signal, which is 
beamed wirelessly to a receiver in the electronics package on 
Barbara’s eye. The receiver then sends a corresponding

 pattern of electric pulses to the electrode array.
Typically, when light passes through the transparent tis-
sue of the retina and strikes photoreceptors, they initiate 
electro chemical signals that propagate forward through a 
layer of bipolar cells to ganglion cells. Millions of nerve ﬁbers 
running from the ganglion cells dive through the eye’s “blind 
spot” and form the optic nerve that carries impulses to the 
brain. The electronic array sits like a postage stamp on the 
ganglion layer, stimulating the cells directly with a small 
amount of electricity. This produces phosphenes, the same 
sensation of light created by rubbing one’s eyes.  
The technician touches the keyboard of a laptop—today it 
will be standing in for the camera, sending information  
to stimulate speciﬁc electrodes—and it emits a loud bloop. 
“Can you see that?” she asks Barbara. “Yes, it was like a ﬂash,” 
Barbara responds.
Eighteen years ago, a blind patient saw a similar ﬂash of 
light when Mark Humayun, an ophthalmologist and biomedi-
cal engineer at the University of Southern California’s  Doheny 
Eye Institute, placed an electrode directly on the person’s 
 retina during surgery. Until that moment, no one knew 
 whether an optic nerve that had gone unstimulated for decades 
could still carry a signal to the brain. “The mantra was, if you 
don’t use it, you lose it,” Humayun says. His discovery made 
the eye a candidate for neural prosthetics—devices that inter-
face with the nervous system to restore function lost to disease 
or injury. At the time, another neural prosthetic was just gain-
ing traction: cochlear implants, which bypass damaged cells 
in the inner ear to directly stimulate the auditory nerve. 
Stimulating the optic nerve, however, is much more com-
plex. Besides involving millions of points that create a picture, 
synapses that communicate across each layer of the retina play 
an important role in honing and sharpening images—a step 
the electronic array skips. “You have to re-create that process-
ing,” Humayun says. “Each 
electrode can’t just ping the 
spot.” Software in the exter-
nal microprocessor converts 
the visual feed into signals 
that should convey the correct 
shape—a doorway, say, or a 
lamppost. But each subject 
must also train to better inter-
pret that information. “If 
you’ve been blind, your brain 
doesn’t just sit there twid-
dling its thumbs,” Humayun 
says. “It ends up taking over 
functions such as hearing 
and maybe even touch. When 
you replace that lost function 
to the brain, those areas have to regroup, reor-
ganize and begin to relearn.”
Four months aFter BarBara’s 
surgery, we’re back at Lighthouse Internat-
ional for an appointment in which she will try 
to identify letters of the alphabet. Barbara 
uses the camera now; it’s embedded dis-
creetly in a pair of sunglasses. Her face is lit by 
the glow of an LCD screen in the darkened 
room, and I can see a white, 10-inch “L” reﬂected in the  lenses. 
Barbara scans her head methodically, left and right, up and 
down, because the visual feed is coming from her glasses, not 
her eyes. “This could be an ‘L,’” she says tentatively. 
“That is an ‘L’! Wow, very nice,” responds Aries Arditi, a 
principal investigator and senior fellow in vision science at 
Lighthouse. Barbara laughs: “Beginner’s luck.”
After a few more letters, Arditi has her take a timed test. 
It’s a control, with the device turned off. Barbara rattles off 10 
letters at random as they appear on the screen, sometimes a 
beat before that, and gets them all wrong. Now, the real test: 
“Take as much time as you want,” Arditi says. Barbara spends 
a few minutes studying each letter. Her answers gradually get 
more conﬁdent, and she misses only three out of 10. “I only 
got three wrong?” Barbara asks. “Whoa! I’m impressed!” 
The following week she gets them all correct. “Barbara’s 
big advantage is Barbara,” Arditi tells me later. “She is really 
very good at exploiting what very minimal information she 
does have. The fact that she can recognize letters is astound-
ing. She’s not going to be reading the newspaper anytime 
soon, but any bit of visual information you get is helpful.”   
As a sighted person, I still don’t understand exactly what

using the

“I refer to it as

she says.

USER INTERFACE
Two 7-inch WVGA displays (one of which is a touch-
screen) provide access to basic functions, vehicle 
information and a graphical efﬁciency coach. A 
smartphone app allows users to schedule charging and 
precondition the cabin while the car is plugged in. 
It’s an EV early adopter’s worst 
nightmare: running out of juice, 
miles from the nearest charging 
station. With the Volt, Chevrolet 
is intent on squelching those 
fears. When the car’s 16-kilo-
watt-hour battery pack becomes 
depleted, the car automatically 
switches to a gas engine—a 
transition that is remarkably 
smooth (it’s nearly impossible to 
discern on the road). And while 
the Volt may not be as fun to 
drive in the conventional sense 
as, say, a Corvette, there’s still a 
Chevrolet Volt
PowERTRAIN
When the Volt’s battery pack is discharged, the 1.4-liter gas-powered four-cylinder engine kicks on to spin the 74-hp 
generator. The engine doesn’t top off the battery but simply runs long enough to maintain performance. The 
generator and 149-hp traction motor are connected to the wheels via a planetary gearset in a way that’s similar to 
the Toyota Prius’s transmission. This arrangement allows both motors to power the wheels, a strategy that keeps 
each motor in its most efﬁcient—and reﬁned—operating range.
AERoDYNAMIC 
DESIGN
Extending the EV’s range 
means minimizing drag, 
which can lead to bland 
shapes. “We didn’t want the 
automotive equivalent of 
Brussels sprouts,” says Bob 
Boniface, the Volt’s lead 
designer. So engineers added 
details such as a gently 
sloping rear hatch, a ﬂat 
bottom and small creases 
and ﬁns that manage 
airﬂow. The result is GM’s 
most aero-efﬁcient car since 
the EV1.  
BATTERY PACk
The 300-volt lithium-ion battery pack is composed of 288 cells, grouped vertically like 
ﬁles in a drawer. To extend battery life, the pack never fully charges or depletes. A 
250-micron-thick, sponge-like membrane separates the plates and holds the organic 
carbonate electrolyte through which the charged lithium ions ﬂow. A dedicated 
liquid-cooling circuit maintains the pack’s temperature to within 2 degrees.

Battery PaCK
With no gas-engine backup, the Leaf's 24-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack is 
both larger and uses a greater percentage of its capacity than the Volt’s pack does. 
Although both companies are tight-lipped about details, the Leaf's 192 cells have a 
slightly different chemistry. They're also stacked horizontally, like books on a table, 
to form a compact pallet under the ﬂoor, freeing up interior space for ﬁve passengers. 
torque
While the Leaf’s electric motor produces only 107 hp, it 
offers a peak 207 lb-ft of torque at 0 rpm. In other 
words: Unlike a gas car, it can pop off the line with an 
immediate and steady stream of power. While braking, 
the motor also charges the battery.
uSer INterFaCe
The Leaf’s digital display and navigation system plot 
the most efﬁcient routes and suggest ways to extend 
range—for example, by reducing the a/c. Drivers will 
also be able to track their performance online and 
compare themselves to other Leaf owners.
ChargINg
Two plugs are located in the nose: a standard Level II 
220-volt charger that ﬁlls the batteries in about 8 hours 
and a Level III quick charger that hits 80 percent in 
30 minutes. The juice needed for 100 miles runs about 
$3—less than half of the cost of gas for the same trip. 
sense of occasion behind the 
wheel. It is smoother and 
quieter than a Cadillac, plus 
in-dash screens add the 
gee-whiz element of revealing 
the car’s inner workings. For a 
plug-in series hybrid, there’s a 
lot of hardware—a gas engine, 
a large battery and electric 
motors—and clever ideas 
under the hood, pushing the 
price to $41,000 ($33,500 
afer the federal subsidy), a 
princely sum for a small car. 
But the Volt is more than the 
sum of its cutting-edge parts: 
It’s a dramatic reinvention of 
the great American car, 
without sacriﬁcing the great 
American road trip. 
Nissan Leaf
It’s not the ﬁrst pure EV, but 
the Leaf is hitting the 
mainstream like none of its 
predecessors. At $33,720 
($26,220 afer the federal 
rebate), the Leaf costs the same 
as an average car and oﬀers a 
100-mile range—enough to 
cover the needs of the vast 
majority of commuters and 
errand runners. More than 
13,000 U.S. buyers have 
already plunked down $99 
deposits, and Nissan hopes to 
soon move 150,000 units a 
year worldwide. The car is 
eerily quiet to drive. “The 
vehicle is equipped with a 
sound generator just so people 
can hear it coming,” says Paul 
Hawson, product planner for 
the Leaf. But the real triumph 
lies in its family-car practical-
ity and normalcy. And since 
electricity is cheaper than gas, 
the Leaf delivers lower 
operating costs. A rational EV 
that doesn’t drive like a science 
project? About time. 
Brilliant Idea: a pure Ev with space for ﬁve, a  
moderate price and enough range for most tasks— 
plus, an operating cost that’s irresistibly low.

Sony Alpha NEX-5 Camera ($700)
Technically speaking, the 14.2-megapixel Sony 
Alpha NEX-5 isn’t a digital SLR. But it has all the 
best parts of the bulky black boxes—including 
the ability to swap lenses and a high-quality 
image sensor—in a package that is far smaller. 
In fact, it’s the smallest interchangeable-lens 
camera yet. The NEX-5 even trumps an expen-
sive SLR in one key respect: It is so adept at 
low-light shooting that Sony’s engineers decided 
to design the camera without a built-in ﬂash. 
Trane ComfortLink II ($300)
It seems almost unfair to compare standard 
thermostats to Trane’s ComfortLink II. When 
planning HVAC schedules, the device’s 7-inch 
touchscreen interface eclipses the competition 
for ease of use and clarity of information. That’s 
key, because the device has so much data to 
share. It gathers online forecasts and ﬁres up 
heating and cooling equipment as the weather 
changes. It also remembers a house’s HVAC 
history, allowing users to compare costs from 
year to year. But the best features could be yet to 
come: Trane claims the system could eventually 
be used to measure speciﬁc machines’ perfor-
mance, combining that with information 
gathered from local utilities to project costs of a 
home’s HVAC operation over time.
Stihl HSA 65 Cordless Hedge Trimmer ($500)
Two-stroke, gas-powered tools are famously polluting and loud, but electric variants typically 
lack the power or durability to really be practical. The 36-volt lithium-ion Stihl HSA 65 
Cordless Hedge Trimmer—the ﬁrst product to be introduced in a new line of battery- powered 
yard tools by Stihl—is poised to convert those homeowners demanding a pro-level cut. A 
single charge provided more than enough power to completely trim and shape a good-size 
yard during our tests. And because the trimmer can be turned oﬀ and on with the ﬂip of a 
switch, it is also more convenient than gas-fueled models: There’s no temptation to idle it.
Qualcomm Snapdragon Processor
While today’s app-hungry superphones require 
almost as much speed as a desktop, the chips 
that power PCs consume enough energy to drain 
a phone battery in minutes. Enter the Qualcomm 
Snapdragon, a processor that oﬀers phones 
(such as the EVO 4G) more than 1 GHz of speed, 
as well as almost-all-day battery life. Competi-
tors Nvidia and Apple have followed with their 
own 1-GHz chips, but Qualcomm continues to 
push the envelope, with 1.3-GHz processors 
coming out this year and upcoming dual-core 
mobile chips that run at 1.5 GHz.

Bosch Axial-Glide Miter Saw ($700)
Typical compound-miter-saw blades are stuck 
on rails. For the Bosch Axial-Glide Miter Saw, 
the company’s engineers looked at the tool’s 
limited range of motion and envisioned the 
saw as it should have been designed. They 
replaced the rails with a series of six hinges so 
that a pair of triple-jointed limbs on the 
12-inch, dual-bevel saw articulate like scissor 
jacks, gracefully and intuitively snapping into 
position to chop even at an odd compound 
angle. And because rails tend to protrude from 
saws, getting rid of them reclaims about a foot 
of precious bench-top real estate. 
DeLorme Earthmate PN-60w With SPOT Communicator ($600)
For sure, many adventurers head into the wild precisely to go where cellphones cannot. But being 
truly incommunicado can be dangerous when a hiking trip is visited by disaster. DeLorme’s 
Earthmate PN-60w with SPOT Communicator not only provides detailed topographical maps and 
GPS guidance in the backcountry, it also lets explorers send SOS messages with embedded 
coordinates via satellite if they’re in trouble—or Facebook updates if they’re not.
GoPoint Technology GL1 and App ($100)
Modern cars rely on sophisticated computers to operate their engines and internal electronics. To 
access these computers, owners typically need to use a scan tool—a device that can cost thou-
sands of dollars. By using an iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch as a window into a car’s computer, the 
GoPoint scan tool and its accompanying app oﬀer the kind of diagnostic info that usually requires 
a trip to the mechanic to retrieve. The intuitive interface allows DIYers to view trouble codes, turn 
oﬀ the Check Engine light and monitor every electrical signal that goes through the computer in 
real time. As a result, consumers can either save a trip to the mechanic or go to the shop armed 
with information that could protect them from fraud. Need more proof that this is the future of 
DIY car maintenance? Other sofware developers are already releasing apps that piggyback on the 
cable, including one that tracks fuel economy.
Sprint EVO 4G by HTC ($200)
By the time this issue drops, Sprint’s 4G 
WiMAX network will be accessible in dozens  
of cities through several handsets. But it all 
started in June with the HTC-manufactured 
Sprint EVO 4G. We’d been waiting anxiously 
for 4G—in a nutshell, a cellular network that 
oﬀers Wi-Fi-like data speeds. By comparison, 
today’s ofen sluggish and overtaxed 3G 
networks seem even more … well, sluggish 
and overtaxed. Competitors have promised 
their own 4G networks (most of which forgo 
WiMAX for the alternate LTE technology), but 
so far, Sprint’s is the only one that is opera-
tional. As for the EVO, its power isn’t conﬁned 
to its 4.3-inch screen: It can also serve as a 
mobile hotspot, allowing up to eight Wi-Fi-
enabled devices to tap into the network.

long test included 
acceleration, handling 
and a real-world fuel-
economy run that took 
us along Michigan’s 
rural backroads and 
Detroit’s city streets. 
Since towing is one 
main reason folks 
buy these trucks, 
we also hitched up 
10,000-pound test trail-
ers and then measured 
acceleration and fuel 
economy again.

i l l u s t r at i o n  b y  d o g o
For towing teﬆs, we used a teﬆ trailer that was  
ballaﬆed to 10,000 pounds and equipped with  
a wind deﬂecor to simulate aero load.
more heft. But the usefulness of the featherweight effort was 
evident in both the tight city parking spaces and when 
backing our trailers—it’s a real fatigue ﬁghter. On the 
highway, that steering does have a large dead spot on center, 
but, hey, this is a pickup truck, not a Porsche.
Ford’s outgoing and outsourced 6.4-liter Power Stroke 
was plagued by poor reliability. So Ford brought the 
operation in-house and created an all-new 6.7-liter V8 with a 
beastly 390 hp and 735 lb-ft of torque paired with a new 
six-speed automatic. (Since our test, Ford has upped the 
engine to 400 hp and 800 lb-ft of torque.) To meet the 2011 
emissions requirement, the Ford uses a 5-gallon urea diesel 
exhaust ﬂuid (DEF) tank that can last up to 7500 miles 
between ﬁll-ups.
The new Power Stroke certainly packs a wallop, but at the 
track, the Super Duty ran a truck length or two behind the 
GMC in just about every speed contest, a result that might 
have been different if we had had the latest version. Yet away 
from the stopwatch, the two felt more evenly matched than 
the numbers suggest. The Ford’s throttle response is razor 
sharp and the torque is nearly instantaneous. Better still, 
the Ford’s diesel was the quietest of the three models tested, 
at full throttle, at idle or on the highway. While towing the 
load, the Ford was also the thriftiest fuel user.
Slide behind the Ford’s big steering wheel and it feels 
like you’ve got a command center at your ﬁngertips. The 
dash is expansive and useful, with toggle switches ready to 
be wired up to your favorite accessories. The center console 
packs a hidden compartment and is reconﬁgurable to 
accommodate just about anything. And we dug the new 
Productivity Screen, a customizable system that provides 
checklists ranging from trailer and off-road setups to 
fuel-economy performance and the temperature of vital 
components. Smart. Flip up the rear seat and there’s a 
handy, lockable storage bin. And like Super Duties of  
the past, our truck came with a deft exhaust brake and 
unique features like the handy tailgate step, power extend-
able towing mirrors and even an electrically locking  
rear differential. 
This was a close contest, but the Ford’s unmatched mix 
of comfort and smart, work-friendly features helped it edge 
out the competition. There’s a reason Ford owns 50 percent 
of the heavy-duty truck market.

When towing trailers that weigh 
more than 7500 pounds—such as this 
loaded Airﬆream—we’ve found that the 
beeﬁer suspension and running gear of 
HD trucks provide greater ﬆability and 
comfort than their light-duty brethren. 
  One wOuld never mistake a  
nearly 4-ton diesel pickup for a muscle car. But 
in this group, the $60,345 GmC could just as 
easily have had a “Z28” badge plastered on its 
ﬂanks—it was quick, hitting 60 mph in under  
8 seconds. Credit the reworked duramax diesel, 
which develops 397 hp and a kenworth-
 crumbling 765 lb-ft of torque. Oh, and the GmC 
provided the best unladen fuel economy— 
nearly 18 mpg. not bad for a 7700-pound truck. Gm says it 
can travel upward of 680 miles on its 36-gallon tank, if 
you’re easy on the throttle. to meet the 2011 diesel 
emissions standard, the GmC uses a urea-based deF 
housed in a 5.3-gallon tank that must be refueled approxi-
mately every 5000 miles. and Gm provides several warning 
messages as the ﬂuid is used up. 
the sierra’s bodywork may look just like last year’s 
model, but under the skin there’s a new fully boxed frame 
and independent front suspension that’s built to carry  
25 percent more weight than last year’s truck. when the 
road started to bend, the GmC’s retuned suspension and 
our model’s blingy 20-inch wheels and low-proﬁle tires 
helped it handle more like a light-duty truck, with the most 
precise steering of the group. On rougher roads around 
michigan, with the bed empty, the GmC generally delivered 
a bumpier ride than the soft Ford but a smoother one than 
the dodge. and on the deepest and sharpest impacts, the 
GmC bucked harder in the rear than either one.
Out on the open highway, the sierra’s mammoth motor 
provided easy cruising and ridiculously effortless passing 
power. unlike those of the Ford and the dodge, the GmC’s  
dash has a low cowl for excellent visibility, and the interior 
is a carbon copy of the ones used in light-duty pickups  
and suvs. the atmosphere inside is very carlike, which is 
one reason the GmC drives smaller than it actually is.  
One thing that’s not so carlike: the air conditioning.  
we tested during a 90-degree heat wave, and the GmC’s 
automatic system labored harder than the others to keep 
the cabin cool. 
Hitched to a trailer, the GmC was more than a second 
quicker to 60 mph than the Ford and more than 4 seconds 
sprightlier than the dodge. that, folks, is signiﬁcant. in our 
informal 15 percent grade towing test, the GmC accelerated 
smartly up the hill. On bumpy roads with that trailer, the 
sierra’s ride nearly equaled the Ford’s, and the setup felt 
exceedingly stable at freeway speeds. we also liked how the 
GmC’s exhaust brake helped slow our load on steeper 
grades without heavily relying on those massive 14-inch 
disc brakes. used as a passenger hauler, the GmC has rear 
seats with contours not unlike those of a bucket seat but 
offering less comfort than the dodge.
Only a few details kept the GmC from the gold medal, 
but its potent and efﬁcient powertrain and sharp handling 
make the sierra Hd easy to fall for.

Dodge Ram 
2500 Laramie 
Crew Cab 4x4
  There’s a heavy-hauler auThenTiciTy To a 
cummins  diesel-powered Dodge ram (a truck that after this 
year will be known only as ram). Fire up the 350-hp 6.7-liter 
inline six and you can feel the heft and torque of this 
1300-pound engine as you prod the throttle. it feels and 
sounds more big-rig than the other two. a version of the 
B-series cummins has lived under the hood of every diesel 
Dodge pickup for the past 21 years. its reputation is 
legendary, and that builds serious loyalty. however, the 
ram’s 650 lb-ft of torque is down by 85 lb-ft to the Ford and 
over 100 lb-ft to the GMc. and so our $55,150 ram trailed 
the other two in every one of our speed contests and 
delivered fewer miles per gallon too.
Though the Dodge was slower than the other two, it  
was more adept at slowing a load—without using the left 
pedal. The Dodge’s exhaust brake felt more powerful than 
those in the other two trucks in both our 7 percent and  
15 percent grade evaluations. That means you can ease off  
the throttle with a heavy load and let the exhaust brake

than the others on the highway. And we were surprised that 
this truck isn’t available with the security of traction or 
stability-control systems. 
Slide into either the Ram’s front seats or the rear ones 
and you’ll ﬁnd better all-day comfort than in the other 
trucks. And like the Ford, our Ram had both heated and 
cooled seats—an option we would certainly order on our 
own truck. Our Laramie’s dash was trimmed in soft-touch 
material that looked very upscale, making for the most 
luxurious interior of the group. 
Pampering aside, the Dodge is, in many ways, an honest 
old-school work truck. It’s a trait we can appreciate. But in 
this group, its level of civility, power and chassis reﬁnement 
felt a half-step behind the competition.    
 
  pm
slow the rig—saving your brakes. 
But the Dodge has a hidden advantage when 
it comes to servicing. The 6.7-liter Cummins 
met today’s tough emissions standard early—
back in 2007—and did so without the use of DEF 
(at about $2.75 a gallon). Instead, Dodge uses a 
nitrogen oxide absorber catalyst. The upside for 
the truck owner? You won’t have those sched-
uled emissions-related service costs. 
The Dodge’s bodywork was new for the 2010 
model year, but the basic bones of the chassis date back to 
2007. That resulted in a ride that was noticeably rougher 
and less sophisticated than the other two. Strapped to our 
test trailer, the Dodge required more steering correction

it was after midnight on oct. 
22, 2008, when lifelong Alaska fisherman 
Guy Schroder was woken up in his bunk  
on board the F/V Katmai. “Guy, we’ve got 
problems,” crewman Carlos Zabala told the 
50-year-old deck boss. “We’ve lost steering.”
Schroder rushed up to the wheelhouse of 
the 73-foot factory cod boat, a vessel he had 
been working on for just a few months. The 
captain was at the helm, struggling to  
control the converted shrimp trawler in 
30-foot seas. Outside the wind was blowing 
close to 100 mph. Schroder noticed that a 
watertight door at the ship’s stern had been

left open, allowing crashing seawater to 
ﬂood into the ship’s processing space. 
He could tell that the motors were 
already underwater.
As the captain issued the order to 
abandon ship, Schroder scrambled to 
pull on a full-body neoprene survival 
suit and to help launch one of the Kat-
mai’s two life rafts. By the time the ves-
sel capsized just minutes later, seven of 
the ship’s 11 crew members had made it 
inside Schroder’s raft, a circular, tent-
like shelter that had been manufactured 
almost three decades earlier. 
“Then, ka-whoom!” the fisherman 
later recounted for Coast Guard investi-
gators. “Everybody got knocked and 
thrown in all directions. It was pitch 
black—and ka-blam! Another wave 
came, and it flipped the raft upside 
down.” All seven men ended up sub-
merged in the 43 F ocean, fighting to 
make their way back to the overturned 
raft. “Now you can’t see the raft’s light,” 
Schroder recalled. “All you can hear is 
screaming, and crying for help.” 
 
the dangers of commercial 
ﬁshing are the stuff of modern legend . 
Fans of the blockbuster book and ﬁlm 
The Perfect Storm and popular reality-TV 
shows like Deadliest Catch and Swords: 
Life on the Line would hardly be surprised 
by the fact that nearly every year the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks com-
mercial ﬁshing as America’s most lethal 
job. Adjusted to the size of the work-
force, the 2008 fatality rate for U.S. ﬁsh-
ermen was ﬁve times that of truck driv-
ers, eight times that of police officers 
and 19 times that of ﬁreﬁghters.
Tragedies at sea are often viewed as 
uncontrollable acts of God. Until a cou-
ple of decades ago, marine-supply stores 
offered steel-soled boots as standard 
gear: Inevitable death at sea was so 
ingrained in many ﬁshermen’s attitudes 
that, when the worst happened, they just 
wanted to sink quickly to the bottom. 
The truth is that—except in the popular 
imagination—an “angry ocean” is almost 
never the primary cause of fatal acci-
dents. Instead, the industry’s high mor-
tality rate is the result of an unromantic 
but entirely preventable mix of flawed 
decision-making, inadequate survival 
training, poorly maintained safety equip-
ment and a lack of government oversight 
that allows U.S. ﬁshing boats to sink at 
the rate of one every three days.
Between 1992 and 2007, a staggering 
1903 American commercial ﬁshing ves-
sels sank, according to a comprehen-
sive Coast Guard report. As a direct 
result, 507 people died, accounting for 
more than half of the 934 commercial 
fishing deaths during that 16-year 
period. Most of the remaining fatalities 
were due to falls overboard or a variety 
of grisly equipment-related accidents. 
It’s no coincidence that the number 
of lost boats and lives is far higher for 
ﬁshing than for any other type of water-
borne industry. Passenger ferries, cargo 
ships and virtually all other commercial 
boats are held to much higher regulatory 
standards. All but the largest factory-
style ﬁshing vessels remain uninspected, 
which means that ensuring a boat’s sea-
worthiness—including the strength of 
its hull, the stability of its design and the 
integrity of its watertight compart-
ments—is solely up to the ship’s owners. 
The only federal law governing ﬁshing-
boat safety mandates survival equipment 
for after an accident occurs. 
“The level of ﬁshing vessel safety stan-
dards is analogous to requiring para-
chutes for an airplane crew, but only 
marketing voluntary measures to encour-
age a mechanically sound aircraft and a 
competent pilot and crew,” the authors 
of a 1999 Coast Guard–commissioned 
report on fishing fatalities wrote. “It’s 
tragic,” says Richard Hiscock, a ﬁshing- 
policy expert and former fisherman. 
“We’ve been trying to get ﬁshing vessels 
inspected since the 1940s. If you stop to 
think about how many families would 
not have been torn apart had we done 
that, it’s mind-boggling.” 
Hiscock helped to draft legislation, 
now languishing in Congressional com-
mittee, that is crucial to lowering ﬁsh-
ing’s unacceptable death toll. If the  
bill passes, the new regulations would 
require Coast Guard inspections for all 
ﬁshing boats more than 50 feet, as well 
as stronger construction requirements 
for new boats, more stringent regulations 
for ofﬁcer licensing and mandatory crew 
training. Meanwhile, boats keep sinking. 
 
in march 2009, the 71-foot 
scalloper Lady Mary sank 65 miles off the 
New Jersey coast, taking the lives of six of 
the seven men on board. Although the 
Coast Guard investigative report has yet 
to be released, it’s evident that, as in the 
majority of vessel losses, a cascade of 
human errors and events contributed to 
the death toll on the scalloper, which was 
part of a ﬂeet that—along with the north-
east groundfishery, the Gulf of Mexico 
shrimp ﬁshery and the Dungeness crab 
fleet in Oregon—has recently proven 
even more deadly than the infamous 
Alaskan fisheries. “One of the biggest 
commonalities comes down to just being 
lazy with your operations,” says Coast 
Guard Commander Kyle McAvoy.
Take the case of the Alaska Ranger, a 
184-foot trawler that sank in the Bering 
Sea in 2008. The ship ﬂooded from the

from the wheelhouse, the ship’s ofﬁcers 
weren’t trained to do so. As a result, the 
crew was forced to enter the life rafts 
from a moving vessel. More than half 
failed—and ﬁve ultimately died. 
Operator error also played a signiﬁ-
cant role in the loss of the Big Valley, an 
Alaskan crab boat that went down in  37 F 
seas in January 2005. Though the Coast 
Guard had a mandatory dockside inspec-
tion program for Bering Sea crabbers, the 
Big Valley’s captain dodged his examina-
tion and left port with almost twice as 
many pots piled on deck as his ship could 
safely carry, which left the boat top-heavy 
and unstable. It capsized and sank. Just 
one of the six men on board survived—a 
crew member who had chosen to sleep 
with his own personal survival suit 
stowed safely by his bed.
As for the New Jersey scalloper Lady 
Mary, survivor testimony and examina-
tion of the wreck indicate that ﬂooding 
started in the stern and spread quickly, 
most likely as a result of compromised 
watertight boundaries in the vessel. 
“Once you get progressive flooding, 
you’re in trouble,” McAvoy says. “What 
would prevent that? It’s training, main-
taining your watertight hatches, the crew 
knowing to keep watertight doors shut 
in certain conditions—somebody mak-
ing sure they’re keeping them shut.”
Though further Coast Guard over-
sight of fishing fleets could eliminate 
many of the egregious structural and 
mechanical problems that sink a lot of 
ships, improving the attitudes, tradi-
tions and safety culture among ﬁshing-
boat ofﬁcers and their crews is just as 
critical. After the Lady Mary disaster, 
lawyers for the ship’s owner (whose two 
sons, one of them the boat’s captain, 
died when it sank) argued that a passing 
cargo ship hit the vessel. No obvious 
physical evidence of such a collision has 
been found. But even if another vessel 
was involved, it’s hard to explain how an 
alert captain or watch stander would not 
have spotted an approaching container 
ship in time to make an adequate may-
day call. That is, until you consider that 
autopsy reports found both the captain 
and his brother had marijuana in their 
systems when they died. 
 
an inexorable progression 
of errors doomed the Katmai, the Coast 
Guard’s Marine Board of Investigation 
found. Any one of them would have 
placed the ship and its crew in harm’s 
way; together, they were a death sen-
tence. Though the Katmai’s captain had 
received a weather forecast of hurri-
cane-force winds and 24-foot seas more 
than two days before the disaster, he 
delayed the decision to head for shelter. 
The onboard weather fax that would 
have delivered regular updates and sat-
ellite images of the worsening condi-
tions was down. It was out of ink and set 
to a frequency in Hawaii, the captain 
later told investigators. 
Though the Katmai had watertight 
doors, they were not in good condition, 
and the crew often left them open at sea. 
A crack in the hull had been repaired 
improperly. That breach, the Coast 
Guard investigation determined, might 
have been the source of the initial ﬂood-
ing. And like dozens of other boats now 
decaying on the ocean ﬂoor, the Katmai 
had been converted for a new type of 
fishing without an updated stability 
report, prepared by a qualiﬁed marine 
architect, that would have advised the 
crew on how to safely load the boat. (For 
boats less than 79 feet, there is no 
requirement for such a report, though 
there should be.) The ship’s ﬁnal report 
dated back two conversions, to 1996, and 
assumed a maximum 60,000 pounds of 
ﬁsh in the hold. At the time of the sink-
ing, there were 120,000 pounds of cod on 
board and at least 16,000 pounds of cod 
pots on deck. 
“There was guidance on board for 
the captain to follow,” says Coast Guard 
Cmdr. Malcolm McLellan, whose report 
on the Katmai disaster recommended 
that captains be licensed and that they 
be required to undergo stability train-

ing. “He knew he exceeded that. He dou-
bled it. As they say, fishing was good, 
and they just put it in the hold.”
The second wave ThaT hiT 
Guy Schroder’s life raft took the roof with 
it. Several men were thrown right through 
the protective covering, which also serves 
as a beacon to searchers above. Though 
the lost canopy had been bright orange, 
the rest of the raft was gray and black, 
making it even more difficult for the 
ejected ﬁshermen to ﬁnd their way back 
to the shelter as they fought through rag-
ing, three-story waves.
“You got these huge, breaking seas 
that are just taking everything out with 
them,” Schroder recalls. “Our raft had 
little or no ballast bags. We were getting 
thrown out of it all night and somehow

dards set by the international Safety of 
Life at Sea (SOLAS) treaty, meaning large 
ballast pockets, a reliable sea anchor 
and doorway ramps to help people 
board the raft from the water. 
Then there’s training. “Fishermen 
have to know how to use their equip-
ment,” says Lincoln, who has found an 
association between survivors and 
those who have completed formal 
safety courses. “If you are going to go 
ﬁsh, at a minimum you should have an 
8-hour marine-safety class on cold-
water survival.”
Sixteen harrowing hourS 
passed before an HH-60 Jayhawk heli-
copter spotted the life raft with Guy 
Schroder and just three other ﬁshermen 
remaining inside. Coast Guard rescuers 
airlifted the men from the mangled raft, 
which by then had also lost its ﬂoor and 
resembled a giant, battered black inner 
tube. It had drifted 35 miles from where 
the Katmai went down.   
A couple of hours earlier, the rescue 
crew had found a body in the waves, still 
outfitted in a neoprene survival suit. 
Two good Samaritan fishing vessels 
eventually recovered four other men—
also with no vital signs. The four ﬁsher-
men in Schroder’s raft were the only 
members of the 11-person crew to make 
it out of the Bering Sea alive. 
“I told them, if you lose the raft, 
you’re out of the pool,” Schroder says of 
the guys who were thrown into the sea 
and never found their way back, includ-
ing his friend Carlos Zabala. “You only 
have a few hours in those conditions. 
You’re swallowing a bunch of big green-
ers. There’s no way you can breathe,” he 
says. “You just can’t. You can’t do it.” 
Unless, that is, your life raft is, in 
fact, a sturdy, reliable shelter. Or, better 
yet, the regulatory and cultural safe-
guards are in place to ensure your boat 
never sinks in the ﬁrst place.

a full-body neoprene survival suit is 
required for every person on board. Mod-
est as it is, the law has had a big impact. 
After its implementation in the early 
1990s, the death rate among shipwrecked 
crewmen fell by close to 50 percent. 
Still, the law contains significant 
blind spots. Many of the survival suits 
ships carry today are the same ones own-
ers bought when the 1988 law went into 
effect. Neoprene stiffens and deterio-
rates as it ages, becoming prone to rips, 
holes and split seams—any of which can 
be fatal in frigid northern seas. The suits 
need expiration dates, Lincoln argues. 
They should also be equipped with 
small but powerful strobe lights and 
personal locator beacons with GPS. As 
for life rafts? They should meet the stan-

Despite the obvious shortcomings of 
the Katmai’s survival gear, the equip-
ment was perfectly acceptable by legal 
standards. “It’s crazy,” says Jennifer Lin-
coln, an injury epidemiologist and com-
mercial fishing safety expert with the 
National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health. “A 1980 life raft 
should not be able to be used in 2008 
and meet regulations.”

 Te circular saw is the great american power tool. 
It’s used for everything from houses, decks and sheds to 
smaller jobs, such as cutting the form lumber for a con-
crete walk or the parts for garage shelves. to teﬆ this 
year’s crop, we gathered 11 tough saws—the heavieﬆ-

duty models oﬀered by their manufac-
turers—and ﬁtted them all with Irwin’s 
Marathon blade (a rugged pro-quality 
cutter with a dense carbide tooth). Ten 
PM teﬆers put the saws to work, exam-
ining cutting power and blade adjuﬆ-
ment, while also looking at more subtle 
features, such as grip design. (Many bet-
ter grips are enhanced with a coating  
of rubber, called an overmold, for com-
fort during long days of cutting.) Finally, 
the teﬆers timed each saw by pushing 
it across a length of LVL header, a 
1¾-inch-thick piece of plywood designed 
to carry the load above a window or 
door. Tese headers are particularly dif-
ﬁcult to cut. By the end of the teﬆ, we’d 
learned that any of these saws will work 
well for a DIY builder, especially when 
equipped with a topnotch blade. But the 
moﬆ demanding users should consider 
our two top performers, which ﬆood

Likes: We like the fac that 
this is a framing contracor’s 
saw. It was the only tool 
with a swing-out hook to 
hang it oﬀ a rafer, another 
plus. It has no cord to 
damage, an innovation 
unique to Bosch—you run an 
extension cord into its 
handle. Depth and angle 
markings are clear and easy 
to read, and everything is 
easy to adjuﬆ. Its conﬆruc-
tion is typically Boschian 
(rugged, that is).
Dislikes: Nothing noted.
Likes: Te Crafsman 
handles well, has reasonable 
power and oﬀers excellent 
visibility of the cut line. Te 
markings for cut depth and

Dislikes: Te Crafsman is 
juﬆ too darn heavy.
Likes: If there’s one thing 
DeWalt excels at, it’s 
building tools for carpenters. 
Tis bread-and-butter cutter 
is an exemplar of the 
company’s tool-building 
approach. It’s extremely 
rugged, light and powerful, 
and it slips nicely into your 
hand. DeWalt skips the 
typical rubber-molded-grip 
surface on the handle, 
favoring its trademark 
pebbled grip—the beﬆ 
alternative to an overmold 
that we know of.
Dislikes: Te ﬆamped-ﬆeel

the  
process
 Te heart of this projec 
is nothing more than an open 
box. Moldings and shaped 
edges help conceal that fac, 
as do subtle proportions. 
I began by crosscutting 
the ends using a miter saw, 
but you could juﬆ as easily 
use a circular saw and guide. 
Next, I marked the arch on 
each end and cut it using a 
jigsaw [ 1 ].
afer completing the ends, 
I ripped to width the upper 
and lower shelves, the key rail, 
the cubbyhole dividers and 
the laminated-pine shelf ﬆock 
for the back. Note that the 
cubbyhole dividers are slightly 
narrower than the upper and 
lower shelves. Tis design 
element helps better deﬁne 
the inside of the case.
Next, I crosscut the upper 
and lower shelves, the key 
rail and the back. using a  
3/8 -inch-radius cove bit and 
router, I cut the decorative 
edge on the bottom shelf  
[ 2 ], the key rail and the back.
before assembly, all that’s 
lef is to crosscut the top and 
cut a cove molding for its 
front and ends. 
one of my favorite ways 
to faﬆen furniture parts is to 
use pocket screws. For this 
projec, I used a Kreg 
pocket-screw jig and the 
syﬆem’s matching drill bit 
and drive bit. Te jig ﬁrmly 
clamps a workpiece while you 
use the drill bit to bore a pilot 
hole at a shallow angle on the 
inside of the workpiece. by 
locating the holes on the 
inside of the case, the 
process eliminates exterior 
 To trim the top, lay a cove 
molding upside down on a 
miter saw (the molding’s top 
reﬆs on the saw table). Cut a 
miter and hold the molding 
againﬆ the cabinet; mark and 
cut the second miter. I 
faﬆened the front molding 
with a pneumatic pin nailer  
[ 5 ], but you could drill pilot 
holes and hammer in 
faﬆeners and the need to join 
parts with carefully cut joints, 
glue and clamps. I bored four 
pocket-screw pilot holes in 
each shelf [ 3 ] and screwed 
them to the ends. Ten I 
bored six pocket-screw holes 
in the back and attached it to 
the ends as well.
Since the dividers need to 
ﬁt between the upper and 
lower shelves, you can't 
simply crosscut them to a 
given dimension. Inﬆead, hold 
each divider between the 
shelves, mark its length, then 
crosscut it. Slide each divider 
into the case and faﬆen it. I 
used a pneumatic nailer and 
1½-inch-long brads. 
Finally, hold the back edge 
of the top even with the back 
of the ends and nail it to the 
ends with 1½-inch brads [ 4 ].

¾-inch-long brads. Now cut a 
miter on the next piece of 
molding, butt it againﬆ the 
front molding and mark its 
length [ 6 ]; do this to the third 
molding as well. Nail these 
pieces to the case. Finally, lay 
the key rail inside the case  
[ 7 ], then drive 1¼-inch 
drywall screws through the 
case back and into the rail. If 
you choose, you can drive 
small screw hooks into the 
rail for hanging keys.
Now set nailheads if 
needed and apply wood 
ﬁller. Sand the case with 
100- and 120-grit sand-
paper. I applied two coats of 
primer and one topcoat of 
latex semigloss. Ten I 
inﬆalled the coat hooks.
Te beﬆ way to 
hang a cabinet is 
with a French cleat. 
It’s ﬆrong and it 
allows the cabinet

To make it, rip two 
pieces of wood at a

into a ﬆud. Hold the 
cleat on the line and

We were thinking of repainting our 
kitchen cabinets—but only if we get 
better results than the paint job that’s 
on them now, which has drips and 
thin spots where you can see another 
color underneath. Should we bother? 
We plan on replacing the kitchen in 
another two or three years.

couple of weekends while spending 
less than $200.
begin by removing the doors and 
drawers or drawer fronts and taking oﬀ 
all door handles, drawer pulls, knobs 
  
If it were my kitchen, I wouldn’t 
put up with ugly cabinets for two 
or three years. Tere’s no need to. With 
today’s paints and tools, you can 
achieve a far better-looking kitchen in a 
and hinges. Many older cabinet doors 
have handles or knobs centered along 
the side edge of the panel, a dead give-
away of an outdated kitchen. afer you 
remove the hardware, fill the holes. 
When the painting is done, you can relo-
cate the handles lower on the door for a 
more contemporary look.
Toroughly clean the door and  drawer 
surfaces with a cleaner- degreaser and 
do the same to any face frames and 
cabinet sides. be particularly faﬆidious 
about cleaning cabinet surfaces that 
are near the kitchen range, because 
these will have more grease and dirt 
than surfaces farther away.

Next, sand the surfaces to remove 
or reduce dents and scratches and to 
degloss the paint. Afer sanding, use 
a moiﬆ cloth or a tack cloth to thor-
oughly wipe oﬀ sanding duﬆ.
Support the doors and drawer 
fronts on blocks of wood or small 
plaﬆic Painter’s Pyramids. Apply a 
primer. Primer not only improves 
topcoat adhesion, its uniform poros-
ity and ﬁlm thickness contribute to 
paint holdout—the ability of the 
paint to ﬂow smoothly over the sur-
face and cure to a uniform gloss and 
thickness. Prime all surfaces, front 
and back, and sand the primer if nec-
essary to remove roller or brush 
marks. Wipe oﬀ sanding duﬆ.
Next, apply the topcoat. To 
achieve a ﬁnish that’s nearly as good 
as one that’s sprayed, you should 
consider laying aside your paint-
brush and using some of the new 
paint rollers available, particularly 
velour or foam varieties. Check with 
the paint ﬆore, though. Some paints 
are diﬃcult to apply with these roll-
ers, causing the roller to slide, for 
example. In other cases, the paint 
won’t ﬂow out, and you’ll be lef with 
a dimpled surface.
Other paints can be brushed or 
rolled, though rolling the paint will 
usually leave a smoother surface. 
For example, Insl-X CabinetCoat is 
an acrylic urethane enamel that’s 
specifically formulated to provide 
an extremely smooth surface when 
applied with a foam roller or when 
using a ﬁne-briﬆle synthetic paint-
brush. Apply two topcoats of what-
ever paint you choose.
Finally, reinstall the doors and 
drawers using new pulls, handles 
and knobs. You’ll be surprised at  
the results when you’re done. It’s 
one of the beﬆ inveﬆments of your 
DIY dollar.
Rotten to the Core

ﬆeps, but what about wood? Four 
out of ﬁve ﬆringers have rotted 
on my front ﬆeps. I only have

beginner-level carpentry skills, so I 
was thinking of replacing them with 
precut pressure-treated ﬆair 
ﬆringers sold at a home center. Will 
those be any good?
Sure. It’s perfecly okay to use precut 
stair stringers—but they may not fit 
your space. For example, if the ﬆairs 
have been built to land on the center of 
a concrete pad, and the precut ﬆringers 
don’t have exacly the same dimensions 
as those of the exiﬆing ﬆairs, then they 
obviously won’t land where you want 
them to. You also have very little control 
over the height of precut stringers—
maybe a fracion of an inch or so.
When you cut ﬆair ﬆringers your-
self, you have complete control over 
their height, horizontal run and the 
angle at which they meet the house. 
Tis ensures that you will end up with 
ﬆairs in which the height of each ﬆep is 
the same and the ﬆairs land where they 
should (the center of the pad).
Tat sounds daunting to the begin-
ner carpenter, but it’s really pretty  
simple in this case. For one thing, if the 
exiﬆing ﬆairs have been built correcly 
(equal riser heights, comfortable and 
level treads and a horizontal run that 
lands the ﬆairs properly), then you can 
carefully demolish them and actually 
use one of the ﬆringers as a pattern. 
You can also go to popularmechanics 
.com and see our article “How to Build 
Your Own Stairs in 3 Easy Steps.”
If you can use a circular saw, a ham-
mer, a tape measure, a square and a 
drill driver, you can handle this projec—
and leave the precut ﬆringers for folks 
who don’t read PM.
Lowdown on the Low Flow
I live in rural Florida, and my water is 
supplied by a well. I have such low ﬂow 
that my inﬆantaneous water heater 
doesn’t work properly, and I can’t take 
a decent shower. My pump is set for 
50 to 70 (the psi for the cut-in and 
cut-oﬀ pressures), if that makes a 
diﬀerence. Te syﬆem works reliably, 
other than the low ﬂow. Any ideas?
Te fac that your pump’s pressure is 
set so high (50 to 70) indicates that 
your water syﬆem is designed more for 
pressure than volume. Pressure set-
tings of 30 to 50 or 40 to 60 are more 
typical. When well-pump pressure is 
high, volume tends to be low, because a 
well pump can’t produce both charac-
teriﬆics to the same degree.
Firﬆ, you need to get a well contrac-
tor out to your place to look things over. 
Te contracor will inveﬆigate whether 
the pump you have is adequately sized 
and whether dirt or mineral buildup any-
where in the well system or in your 
home’s plumbing is interfering with the 
well’s ﬂow. 
Assuming everything checks out 
okay, one solution is to augment the 
exiﬆing well pump with a sophiﬆicated 
two-part setup like the AquaBooﬆ II by 
Goulds Pumps. Te ﬁrﬆ part of this sys-
tem consiﬆs of a ﬆorage tank at atmo-
spheric pressure. It acs as a reservoir 
and is kept ﬁlled by the exiﬆing well 
pump. A ﬂoat sensor in the tank triggers 
the pump when water in the tank drops 
below a predetermined level.
The other half of the system is a 
booﬆer pump and its related compo-
nents, including a transducer that con-
verts water pressure to an elecrical 
signal and a controller-reciﬁer. When 
someone in the home uses water, a 
transducer tells the pump controller-

reciﬁer what the water-syﬆem pres-
sure is. 
Te controller-reciﬁer has two func-
tions. Firﬆ, it turns on and operates the 
pump’s variable-speed motor. Second, 
it reciﬁes the home’s single-phase elec-
trical current and turns it into three-
phase. Tis type of current is far more 
elecrically and mechanically eﬃcient 
for operating motors, since the peak 
voltage of each phase is closer to the 
one next to it than in ﬆandard residen-
tial single-phase power.
Te variable-speed motor and pump 
run conﬆantly, so long as water is being 
drawn. The motor’s variable speed 
adapts automatically to the demand, 
keeping water pressure conﬆant. Te 
greater the demand, the faster the 
motor spins and the bigger the booﬆer 
pump’s output. 
Myﬆery Microwave
We’ve had two microwave ovens fail 
in our four-year-old house since it was 
built. Both were over-the-range types. 
Te magnetron went on one, and 
we’re not sure why its replacement 
has quit. Can a wiring problem be to 
blame?
Anything’s possible. Given that you 
haven’t reported additional electrical 
issues (dimming lights, other erratic 
appliances, circuit breakers that fre-
quently trip or problems that popped up 
afer a lightning ﬆrike), I’d reason that 
the grid’s power quality or electrical 
glitches inside the house are not to 
blame here. Still, any electrician or 
mechanically experienced person can 
check for under- or overvoltage and cur-
rent flow on the 20-amp dedicated 
small-appliance circuit. Tis should be 
easy to do, especially in a new house in 
which the wiring hasn’t been tinkered 
with. One caveat applies, however. 
Because checking this requires working 
on an energized circuit, it’s no task for 
anyone who’s uncomfortable with this 
kind of work. 
My hunch is that you’ve had two 
unrelated component failures. Te ﬁrﬆ 
was the magnetron. As to the second, 
my vote would be a circuit-board prob-
lem—all appliance components are the 
focus of relentless coﬆ cutting these 
days, it seems, and circuit boards are no 
exception. I’ve seen more than my share 
of them with solder blobs, burns and 
broken parts. Tat’s juﬆ what’s visible—
who knows what you’d ﬁnd on these 
bad boards when you subjec them to 
elecrical teﬆing.
Down the Drain
When I inveﬆigated why a bathroom 
sink in my home drains slowly, I 
discovered that its ﬆeel pipe drain is 
almoﬆ completely ﬁlled with ruﬆ. I’ve 
noticed that virtually every other 
ﬁxture in the house (at leaﬆ the ones  
I can see) have been replaced with 
PVC pipe. I’m inclined to try this job 
myself. Any tips? 
If the drain is that badly rusted, I 
wouldn’t even bother putting a pipe 
wrench to it. Buy or borrow a recipro-
cating saw and cut away the drain  
components.
Next, make a couple of (or several) 
sketches of the drain’s layout: one that 
shows the sink from above, including 
the center line of the drain in the sink; 
another that shows the sink and drain 
components when viewed from the 
side; and one that shows how the drain 
runs on the opposite side of the wall, 
including its relationship relative to ﬂoor 
joiﬆs. Yes, that’s a lot of sketching, but 
you’ll be glad you have them when you 
go to the plumbing-supply house or 
home center. It’s amazing the details 
you can forget between your house and 
the ﬆore. If you can take a decent digi-
tal photo or two, that helps, as well. 
From there, you’ll need a PVC pipe 
saw to cut plaﬆic pipe, a deburring tool, 
a half-round ﬁle or utility knife (to remove 
the rough edge lef from cutting), the 
pipe itself, pipe ﬁttings, primer/cleaner, 
glue and some disposable plaﬆic gloves 
to keep the glue oﬀ your hands.

 1 → “For me, it’s easier to ﬆand the log on end to 
make vertical cuts,” Barnes says. He sinks a 6-foot log 
into a shallow hole and uses a chain saw to mill two 
3-inch-thick slabs for use as a back and seat. To guide 
the cut, Barnes marks a line or follows a ﬆraight  
2 x 4. Producs such as the Accutech Micro Mill, the 
Beam Machine or the Alaskan Chainsaw Mill help 
control the tool. “Keep the tip of the saw through the 
log,” Barnes says, to keep sawn faces smooth and 
avoid kickback. He uses ﬁve diﬀerent saws. For deep 
cuts, he breaks out a big 86-cc Jonsered with a 
24-inch bar. For detail work, Barnes has a petite 42-cc 
Husqvarna with a 12-inch dime-tip carving bar and 
quarter-inch chain.

sponding pegs, or tenons, into the seat and back slabs’ 
ends. Te tenons are ﬆout—Barnes saws and chisels 
away only about 3/8 inch of material, leaving the slabs 
more than 2 inches thick. When the tenons slide tightly 
into the mortised ends, the bench is ﬁnished—”held 
together with gravity and fricion,” Barnes says.

PriCes for labor and Parts 
Can make an older Car too 
exPensive to keeP on the

 Coﬆ of ownership is higher on newer cars, largely because they’re more capa-
ble, far cleaner and fuel-eﬃcient and far safer. Tat 1965 muﬆang you used to ﬁx 
for a few bucks doesn’t come close to meeting today’s government regulations, 
goes down the road like a tracor compared with a modern car and had few of the 
elecronic doodads we now take for granted. ultimately, however, we pay for the 
technology—a 1965 muﬆang coﬆ juﬆ $2500—both initially and for repairs. here 
are some examples of why ﬁxing today’s cars is so expensive.

the cruise control. 
Why all this fuss inﬆead of an old-
fashioned, inexpensive-to-fix carbure-
tor? One word: emissions. A new car 
emits less than a tenth of a percent of 
the tailpipe emissions—not counting 
CO2—of 40-year-old ﬆeeds. Tank the 
computer’s constant, tight control of 
ignition timing and air–fuel ratio. Tat’s 
the good news. Te bad news: To diag-
nose many computer issues and its doz-
ens of sensors requires a scan tool that 
is capable of accessing the thousands of 
manufacurer-speciﬁc trouble codes and 
data streams. A good one can cost 
$7000. And in a busy dealership or shop, 
every technician will need one. Once the 
trouble codes and data ﬆream are an 
between the alternator and the com-
puter. If the charging voltage is a tad low 
at idle, the computer will bump up the 
current in the alternator’s field wind-
ings—to slightly increase the voltage—
and possibly increase the idle speed to 
help charge the battery. Te idle–air con-
troller used to control the idle speed also 
replaces mechanical chokes. To boot, 
the throttle blades are acually operated

Bodywork
Traditionally, car bodies were built 
solely with mild ﬆeel, whether it was a 
body­on­frame car or a unit body, with 
stamped­steel panels spot­welded 
together. Repairing them was easy—
hammer things more or less back to 
shape, slap on some Bondo and paint. 
Contemporary crash standards have 
changed all of that. A lot of car bodies 
employ high­strength steel to save 
weight. Te panels are pre­crumpled to 
fold where intended in an accident.
And that means that the body is an 
integral part of the vehicle’s safety sys­
tem. Juﬆ heating bent parts up with 
the rosebud tip on an acetylene torch 
and cranking it back with a hydraulic 
Porta Power won’t cut it anymore. 
Damaged pieces have to be carefully 
replaced with new facory panels and 
welded on with MIG or TIG welders. Tis 
takes longer and requires a much higher 
level of skill and training from body­shop 
technicians. Welding in a radiator­core 
support on a new luxury car after a 
front­end crash might take 6 to 8 hours, 
plus another 6 to 8 to remove and 
replace all the bolted­on pieces around 
it, compared with a total of 3 to 4 hours 
on cars of a generation ago. Ten add in 
the thousands of dollars to replace the 
airbags, airbag sensors and harness.
HVAC
An automotive a/c technician used 
to ply his trade with no more than a set 
of pressure gauges, a vacuum pump 
and a voltmeter. Ten we discovered 
that R­12 is a major greenhouse gas; 
technicians were no longer allowed to 
simply vent R­12. So they needed an 
R­12 recovery machine, which costs 
several grand. At the same time, the 
price of R­12 skyrocketed. 
Then R­12 was replaced by even 
more expensive R­134a that required 
another expensive recovery device. A 
simple a/c service used to be less than 
an hour’s labor and included less than 
ﬁve bucks of R­12. Now a similar ser­
vice on a modern machine takes 2 to 3 
hours, and requires nearly a hundred 
bucks’ worth of R­134a. Te complexity 
of HVAC syﬆem controls has increased, 
forcing technicians to buy manufacurer­
 speciﬁc diagnoﬆic tools. 
From the Other Side
We interviewed several techni­
cians from large, busy OEM dealerships, 
all of whom declined to be named. Tey 
universally blamed high repair coﬆs on 
vehicle complexity and the crowded 
engine compartments of modern cars.  
We then asked Bob Freudenberger, 
editor­in­chief of Master Technician 
magazine, former service technician 
and PM contributor, for his view.
“A technician’s personal toolbox can 
cost as much as $100K for a senior 
technician who’s acquired a lot of capa­
bility­enhancing special tools.
“A building situated on a good loca­
tion on a highway can coﬆ the shop 
owner $2000 a month per bay, maybe 
$1500 if the location isn’t as good. 
Because moﬆ independent repair shop 
owners are technicians who thought 
they could do better, the shop is rented, 
not owned. A four­bay independent 
shop can realize maybe a half­million 
gross annually—but out of that there 
are salaries for the mechanics and parts 
guys, rent, heat and light, disposal of

Even the dealer, who often charges 
more per hour, is making a similar return

Stripped Treads
Repaired Treads
I sawed this Ford Modu-
lar V8 Cylinder head into 
three pieces (which took 
a couple of hours with a 
big band saw). It came 
from a 1999 Ford V10 
pickup truck, cour-
tesy of Jasper Engines, 
a national rebuilder of 
engines and transmis-
sions. Jasper automati-
cally puts threaded repair 
inserts in 100 percent of 
the heads they rebuild, 
heading oﬀ problems 
down the line.

in a couple of hours for around 
$200. an odd observation: Te 
plugs have never been changed, 
because the truck has only 
63,000 miles and the change 
interval is 100,000. 
I returned home without 
incident, only to have the same 
plug blow out again. Tis time I 
took it to the dealer, who 
insisted on changing the rest of 
the plugs before getting me an 
estimate for the repair. Esti-
mate: $4440. say what?! Tey 
want to remove the body from 
the frame to repair the stripped 
threads, which I ﬁnd ludicrous 
and laughable and horrifying, 
needless to say. Tere has to 
be a cheaper way.
Mod Engine Unplugged
I was driving along at normal freeway speeds in my 2001 F-250 last 
week when it made a funny noise and started to run roughly. (If only I’d 
known what was to come, I would have lef it in a bad neighborhood 
with the keys in the ignition.) seeing as how I was on vacation, I took it 
to a local repair shop. Te mechanic said that one of the spark plugs 
must have been tightened insuﬃciently the last time they were 
changed, because it had blown out of the cylinder head. on its way 
out, the errant plug damaged the coil for that cylinder and stripped 
the threads. he repaired the damaged threads and had me on my way 
From the top: Ford 4.6, 5.4 V8 and 
6.8 V10 ohC engines from 1999 
through 2004, whether in trucks or the 
Mustang or Crown Vic, used a spark 
plug with only four threads securing it 
to the aluminum head. and a percent-
age of them have a habit of parting 
company with the head on their own, 
even plugs that have never been 
changed or removed since the engine 
was built at the factory. on its way 
north, the projecile plug can damage 
the coil-on-plug ignition coil and the 
nearby fuel rail or, occasionally I hear, 
put a dent in the hood sheet metal. Ford 
changed these engines over to a plug 
that uses eight threads afer it became 
obvious there was a problem. and no, 
the warranty usually doesn’t cover it 

to happen with only an inch or so of 
clearance between the cylinder heads 
and the body or other underhood obﬆa-
cles. A good mechanic can usually 
remove the truck cab from the frame 
and repair the threads or replace the 
heads faﬆer and cheaper than trying to 
do it in situ. It’s a little easier on passen-
ger cars but ﬆill not a job for a Saturday 
Mechanic—leave this job for an experi-
enced technician who’s done it before.
I do agree with the dealer: I’d put 
inserts in all eight plug holes now, 
inﬆead of waiting for them to turn into 
popguns one at a time. Tat’s why they 
insiﬆed on changing all the plugs ﬁrﬆ, 
because odds are more will ﬆrip when 
being removed, and they’ll ﬁnd it easier 
to sell you on this huge bill if more plug 
holes are fouled.
Tere are alternatives to Ford’s pro-
cedure, with special tools and inserts 
that the manufacturers claim can be 
inﬆalled successfully with the engine 
and bodywork lef in place—even if the 
when it expires afer 24,000 miles or 
two years. Ford has issued a Technical 
Service Bulletin (TSB) on the proper 
repair, but you’re on your own for the 
(subﬆantial) coﬆ.
Inﬆalling helicoils is a time-honored 
way to repair ﬆripped threads but isn’t 
a good procedure in this inﬆance: Heli-
coils tend to fail early, and even if they 
don’t, the ﬆainless-ﬆeel insert doesn’t 
conduc as much heat to the head from 
the plug as bare aluminum, making that 
plug run hot. Ford has an approved pro-
cedure to repair these heads that uses 
an aluminum insert. Inﬆalling this insert 
is laborious, exacting work and 
extremely difficult to do successfully 
when the cylinder heads are on the 
engine. It’s a multistep process that 
involves drilling the spark-plug hole, cut-
ting a new seat for the base of the 
insert, tapping threads and then inﬆall-
ing the new threaded insert. Ten the 
mechanic has to remove any aluminum 
shavings from the cylinder. All of this has 
P M  D I Y  a u t o  /// c a r  c l I n I c  q + a
plug hole has already been tapped over-
size to accommodate that failed heli-
coil. Repair kits are available from Cal-
Van, Time-Sert and Ford’s preferred 
supplier, Lock-N-Stitch. I have no per-
sonal experience with any of them. 
Chatterbox
No, I do not have a talking window! 
But my 1996 Toyota Avalon driver-
side power window chatters/vibrates 
when raising and lowering. It’s driving 
me up a wall, and I don’t know how to 
ﬁx it without tearing into the door.  
Any recommendations?
Lube the window tracks and rubber lip 
seals with silicone spray. No, you don’t 
have to take the door apart: Juﬆ spray 
the tracks when the windows are fully 
down and spray the seal’s inner edges. 
Run the windows up and down a few 
times, then clean up the mess. 
Oil Crisis
My 1990 Range Rover Classic 
requires synthetic oil, but I acciden-
tally put in regular. Will this cause any 
problems, and what should I do to 
replace the oil?
I can ﬁnd nothing in the service litera-
ture that speciﬁes anything other than 
mineral oil for your Range Rover. Syn-
thetic would provide more engine pro-
tecion in temperature extremes, but 
Range Rover says the mineral oil is ﬁne. 
Juﬆ do your normal oil change at the 
regular interval, or right away if you feel 
underproteced, using the speciﬁed oil.
I Can See Clearly Now 
My 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor has 
ﬆarted losing its clear coat in patches. 
Is there any way I can repair it without 
getting a new paint job?
No. All of the clear coat is going to have 
to be sanded oﬀ, because it’s not bond-
ing properly to the paint underneath it.
In theory, you could then respray juﬆ 
the clear coat. In reality, the pigment 
layer will be sanded through to the 
primer or even to the metal in a lot of 
places. So the color coat will have to be 
resprayed as well. Don’t expec a qual-
ity job to be inexpensive. 
Fantasy Squared
I have seen a Tesla Roadﬆer down-
town a couple of times. When  

Got a car problem?   
Ask Mike about it.  Send your ques-
tions to pmautoclinic@hearst.com 
or over Twitter at twitter.com/Pop 
MechAuto or to Car Clinic, Popular 
Mechanics, 300 W. 57th St., New 
York, NY 10019-5899.  While we 
cannot answer questions individu-
ally, problems of general interest  
will be discussed in the column.
I watched it take oﬀ, I noticed that it 
had the sound of exhauﬆ pipes. I 
thought that the Tesla Roadﬆer was 
all elecric, and, if it is all elecric, 
why would the car make a noise 
when moving like it had a combus-
tion engine?
You’re right, an EV doesn’t make engine 
noises. In this case, the owner probably 
inﬆalled an afermarket sound-eﬀecs 
generator, perhaps from European 
tuner Brabus. It makes all kinds of 
sounds—conventional engine roars, a 
Star Trek–y whoosh, jet-plane screeches 
and even a locomotive belch. Who says 
elecric cars aren’t really juﬆ big toys?
How Faﬆ Is Too Faﬆ?
I have a 2005 Toyota Tacoma 4WD 
with the original facory-optional 
18-inch wheels and Michelin 
P275/55R18 tires. I recently noticed 
that while driving at highway speeds 
(65 to 70 mph), the speed that was 
showing on my Garmin Nuvi GPS was 
consiﬆently about 3 mph less than 
the speed showing on my speedom-
eter.  Which, if either, is correc?
Te GPS will generally be more accu-
rate. Te vehicle speedo is dependent 
on the outside diameter of the tires 
being exactly what the engineers 
designed into its drive calibration. New 
tires will be larger in outside diameter 
than worn tires, as will tires hot from 
being recently driven, because of the 
increased pressure. Even over inﬂating a 
tire will make it larger, which will make 
the speedo read lower than the vehicle’s 
actual road speed. Worn or under-
inflated tires spin faster for a given 
speed, making the speedo read higher. 
Maybe someday cars will use the 
onboard GPS to provide more accurate 
data, but not yet.  
Te Pause Tat Refreshes
My battery hold-down bracket 
somehow came loose, and the battery 
shifed, knocking one of the caps oﬀ. I 
didn’t know about this until I needed a 
jump. I ﬁlled the open cell with tap 
water—that’s all I had—and reinﬆalled 
the cap. Over a short period of time, 
the battery continued to weaken until 
I had to replace it. Could I have put any 
of the following subﬆances in the 
battery to extend its life? What would 
have happened if I had put one or a 
combination of these subﬆances in 
that battery?  
1. Gatorade (powder or liquid)
2. Saltwater
3. Baking soda
I am very anxious to know before I get 
ﬆuck again.
Normally, the only thing you should even 
consider putting into a lead-acid car bat-
tery is diﬆilled or demineralized water. 
Te battery’s normal discharge/recharge 
cycle evaporates H2O out of the elecro-
lyte—a mixture of sulfuric acid and 
water—and thus it might require peri-
odic replacement. Maintenance-free 
batteries are sealed and can’t be topped 
oﬀ, but based on your queﬆion, you 
have the traditional ﬆyle with accessible 
caps, which, incidentally, I prefer. In any 
case, the open cell wasn’t juﬆ low on 
water, it was short of elecrolyte because 
it was spilled, so the proper thing to 
replace it was . . . more elecrolyte. 
Next time: Use a battery hydrome-
ter, syringe or even an eyedropper to 
pirate an equal amount of elecrolyte 
from the other ﬁve cells and put the liq-
uid in the empty cell. Make sure that 
when you’re done, all six cells have an 
equal amount. Next, you’ll need a 
hydrometer to measure the acid/water 
ratio of the elecrolyte. With that data 
in hand, replicate the mixture —moﬆ 
parts ﬆores carry H2SO4—and use it to 
ﬁll all six cells to the bottom of the ﬁller 
necks, which is the correc level. 
Don’t wait to perform this proce-
dure, even if your battery has enough 
juice to ﬆart the car. If the metal grids 
in the battery are exposed to the air  
for even a day or two, they’ll sulfate 
and become damaged. Adding any  
of the substances you mention will 
quickly destroy your battery, as will 
adding virtually anything except dis-
tilled water or properly diluted elecro-
lyte as appropriate.

 Before we discuss the wonder that is the Xbox backpack, let’s go through 
the reasons why such an invention isn’t at all necessary. Firﬆ, there are already 
two respecable portable video-game platforms: Sony’s PlayStation Portable 
(PSP) and Nintendo’s DS (with the 3DS coming out soon). Tese are lightweight, 
pocket-size, aﬀordable and more than adequate for on-the-ﬂy fun.

 distincly nonportable. When you com-
bine the main unit with its big honkin’ 
power supply, the combo weighs 
9 pounds. Te power requirements for 
this beaﬆ are formidable; ours draws 
almoﬆ 200 watts of power (the neweﬆ 
version draws less)—nearly three times 
the load of an Apple MacBook laptop. 
Te power supply converts 110-volt AC 
current into two separate voltages of 
DC power, and the plug into the Xbox is 
totally proprietary. Unsurprisingly, no 
battery on the market can power it.
Add to that a delicate, spinning opti-
cal drive, the lack of an integrated dis-
play and a massive heat exhauﬆ that 
requires acive ventilation, and you’ve 
pretty much outlined the engineering 
challenges we set for ourselves when 
we ﬆubbornly insiﬆed on building this 
thing into a backpack.
Why bother? Oh, come on, you know 
why—because it’s there, because it’s dif-
ﬁcult and because no portable gaming 
syﬆem is as cool as the Xbox 360. Plus, 
we’re pretty sure no one else is walking 
around with a dual-display, battery- 
powered Xbox that allows you to play 
Halo: Reach while camping—and we 
crave that kind of geek credibility.
Yet we also know our limitations.

Mainboard 
to ﬁt the guts of the Xbox 
inside our backpack, we 
removed the syﬆem’s outer 
plaﬆic casing, then bolted its 
internal metal cage to the shell 
of the backpack. to maintain 
airﬂow, we drilled intake and 
exhauﬆ holes in the pack.

Drives 
Like moﬆ of the Xbox’s 
working parts, the hard drive is 
hidden within the conﬁnes of 
the backpack. But to load 
games, we needed the optical 
drive to ejec out the side. So 
we mounted the Xbox 
faceplate and the dVd drive to 
the outside of the pack.

Wireless
What’s better than a portable, 
battery-powered Xbox 360? A 
portable, battery-powered, 
completely networked Xbox 
360! We kluged up the 
connecivity with an Xbox 
wireless networking adapter 
and a Virgin Mobile MiFi 3g 
hotspot.

Displays 
Not one, but two displays! Our 
7-inch Viore portable tV was a 
Walmart special at $67. It had 
its own internal battery and 
was mounted to the back of 
the pack. For forward-facing 
acion on the go, we also 
rigged up Myvu Cryﬆal video 
glasses ($180).
 Parts List
Te Frankenpack 


We were pretty sure we could build an 
Xbox 360 into a backpack with X-Aco 
blades, screwdrivers, electrical tape 
and—for the ﬆubborn parts—a Dremel 
angle grinder. Yet we were also pretty 
sure we were going to need to hit up 
some outside expertise on the battery 
pack. So we contaced Xbox peripheral 
manufacturer Performance Designed 
Products, and begged for some help 
(see below for details).
Start With a Strong Bag
 Choosing our backpack wasn’t 
easy. We needed something with ﬆruc-
ture, but a true hard shell was going to 
be diﬃcult to work with. Afer a bit of 
searching, we found the Boblbee 
Amphib Pro 30 ($190), a bright-orange, 
lightweight, ultra-modern-looking dry-
bag/backpack combo constructed of 
ballistic nylon with foam backing. 
Strong, yet easy to cut holes into, the 
Amphib Pro was also juﬆ big enough to 
ﬁt an Xbox —in other words, barely big 
enough to ﬁt anything else, including 
our hands. As you can imagine, it’s  fairly 
diﬃcult to work in such tight quarters, 
so all of the conﬆituent components, 
the wiring and the assembly sequence 
had to be decided upon and planned 
out before we hard-mounted anything 
inside the pack.  
We knew we could get the Xbox into 
the backpack, but what good is an Xbox 
without a screen? (Tat’s a rhetorical 
queﬆion—you need a screen.) At ﬁrﬆ, 
we took the easy route and bought a 
battery-powered 7-inch Viore portable 
TV from Walmart ($67). Tis el cheapo 
set lacks hi-def inputs—sporting only a 
composite video minijack—but hi-def is 
a rarity at this screen size. Plus, the 
Viore has a built-in tuner for on-the-road 
TV watching as well. More importantly, 
it was small enough to be inﬆalled in 
one of the few crevices of unused space 
in the pack, so we cut a screen-size  
hole in the back of the pack to ﬁt it in. 
A screen mounted to the pack is nice 
to have, but it didn’t seem like the opti-
mal solution. Afer all, you’d need to  take 
oﬀ the backpack to play a game. Our 
quest for a truly mobile game- playing 
experience led us to the unwieldy piles of 
negleced gadgets in our lab, where a 
quick dig revealed an additional option—
the Myvu Cryﬆal personal media viewer. 
Essentially a pair of opaque glasses with 
tiny, built-in 640 x 480–pixel screens, 
the Myvu display had always seemed to 
us like a technology in search of a praci-
cal application. Now, combined with our 
completely impracical creation, it sort 
of makes sense. (At leaﬆ, it does until 
one of us walks into a bus while playing 
Gears of War.)
When in Doubt, Use Velcro
 As you might expec, it took many 
hours of trial and error and a few emer-
gency trips to Home Depot and Micro 
Center to wire, bolt, Velcro and tape it 
all together. We had to make some 
compromises: Our 12-pound battery 
pack was too big to ﬁt inside, so we 
ﬆrapped it to the exterior, making our 
high-tech bag resemble a World War II 
radio backpack. And at 27 pounds total, 
the backpack is no picnic to carry 
around. Yet, aﬆoundingly, it works.
We’ll end with a note of warning and 
a surprising bit of encouragement to 
anyone who dares attempt a mobile 
Xbox syﬆem: Firﬆ, prepare your exten-
sor muscles—your lower back is not 
going to thank you for this projec. Sec-
ond, if you are willing to lug this thing 
around, you really can take a fully net-
worked entertainment syﬆem with you. 
We were able to play games as well as 
watch movies and even TV outside. It 
felt like being in a living room made of 
dirt. At leaﬆ until the battery died.

Once you’ve discovered the best

you’re dealing with a 
voice­controlled phone 
system, you can also 
repeatedly say “representa­

 feeling particularly salty and 
aren’t around any children, yell 
curse words. If the system

Kinec Compatible 
I was at a ﬆore and saw one of those 
slimmer, new black Xbox 360 syﬆems. 
On the box, it said it was “Kinec 
Ready.” Does that mean my older 
Xbox 360 won’t work with the Kinec 
geﬆure-controlled interface? 
Microsoft’s Kinect interface—which 
trades out physical controllers for ﬂail-
ing limbs—may be new, but there’s no 
need to toss out your old Xbox 360 juﬆ 
yet. A quick call to Microsof conﬁrmed 
that all exiﬆing Xbox 360s—whether 
they rolled off the assembly line in 
2005 or in 2010—can handle the add-
on. Te newer black consoles, however, 
still offer some advantages over the 
older machines—they use less power 
than their anceﬆors and take up less 
shelf space.
Android Update
I am intereﬆed in the new Android 2.2 
operating syﬆem. If I have an older 
Android phone, can I update to the 
new version of the OS?
It depends on which phone you have. 
Android 2.2—or Froyo, as Google has 
taken to calling it, evoking frozen 
treats—is a pretty big update. Not only 
does it deliver the typical interface 
tweaks and bug fixes, but it gives 
phones the ability to load Flash web-
sites. This offers a stark contrast to 
Apple, which refuses to support Flash 
on the iPhone and iPad. And since Froyo 
began trickling out this summer, a few 
older Android phones have been blessed 
with the update (typically delivered 
automatically and over the air). Tese 
phones include the Google Nexus One, 
the Sprint HTC EVO, the Verizon Droid 
X and the original Verizon Droid. Unfor-
tunately, owners of some older and 
less-powerful Android phones, such as 
the T-Mobile G1, may be ﬆuck with old-
er and less powerful versions of the 
operating syﬆem, as well. 
Drag, Drop, Save
I heard that Gmail now oﬀers the 
ability to save attachments by 
dragging and dropping them from my 
Web browser. I tried this, and it didn’t 
work. What could be going wrong?
I love Gmail’s new drag-and-drop fea-
ture, which allows you to save e-mail 
attachments just by clicking the file, 
then dragging it from the Web browser 
into a desktop folder. Problem is, at 
leaﬆ for now, it works only in Google’s 
Chrome Web browser. So if the feature 
doesn’t seem to be working, you’re 
probably using Firefox or Safari. Tis is a 
noted contrast to a similar feature 
Google added to Gmail back in April—
the ability to add attachments to 
e-mails by dragging and dropping them 
into the Web browser—which works 
across multiple browsers.

Barbara sees through the artificial 
retina, so on my next trip to California 
I drop by Caltech to visit theoretical 
physicist Wolfgang Fink (now at the 
University of Arizona). He seats me in 
front of a 15-inch MacBook Pro in a 
windowless basement lab. The image 
displayed by the laptop’s camera is 
me, sort of. It is a 4 x 4 array of fat, 
square pixels in a mosaic of black, 
gray and white; I’m the black blocks 
on the left-hand side. “Current retinal 
implants have orders of magnitude 
less [pixels] than what a camera deliv-
ers,” he says. “Therefore, one of the 
ﬁrst tasks of image processing is to 
sample the hi-res image to make the 
low-res image out of it.” 
Fink changes the view from 16 pix-
els to 64, roughly the equivalent of 
Barbara’s implant. Now, when I pass 
my hand in front of the camera, gray 
blocks shimmer diagonally across the 
array. “The levels of brightness the 
camera takes in are translated to levels 
of visual stimulation—strong phos-
phenes versus weaker ones,” Fink 
says. Then he loads a 32 x 32–pixel 
array, or 1024 electrodes, the goal. The 
image sharpens to graphics akin to an 
old Atari game. I can pick out the plaid 
of my shirt, my hair, even the general 
contours of my face. 
Now Fink begins to manipulate the 
image with an Artiﬁcial Vision Support 
System (AVS2): He turns on a contrast 
enhancement ﬁlter, which makes the 
dark and light pixels  starker; when he 
activates edge detection I can see the 
outline of my hand, and adding image 
blur causes it to become more avatar-
like. Each layer of processing improves 
the utility of the otherwise limited 
arrays. “We’d like to make sure we can 
give the blind subject as many image-
processing ﬁlters in real time as possi-
ble to choose from to make their visual 
experience better,” Fink says. 
He cautions me that what I’m see-
ing, however, is still through the ﬁlter 
of my own healthy retina, so it’s an 
ideal image. Fink leads me to a 
National Science Foundation–funded 
Digital Sight for the Blind

project: a rover about the size of a large 
Tonka truck with a camera gimbaled 
at the front center. Loaded with the 
AVS2, the rover, called Cyclops, can 
navigate around a room using only the 
number of pixels a researcher gives it, 
providing a much better approxima-
tion of what the blind might see. (Two 
of Barbara’s electrodes, for example, 
turned out to be disabled.) Plus, 
researchers can use it 24/7, allowing 
them to home in on optimal image 
processing for different environ-
ments, sparing test subjects exhaust-
ing groundwork. 
During one of BarBara’s 
checkups at the hospital, her surgeon 
showed me a scan of her eye with the 
Argus II implant. The eye looked like a 
celestial orb—Mars with dust storms 
swirling across its surface—and the 
electrode array resembled the aerial 
view of a well-lit alien city. Under a 
microscope in a clean room at Law-
rence Livermore National Laboratory 
in Livermore, Calif., the array appears 
much more clinical. This is the third 
generation of the device—the Argus III, 
in preclinical testing now—and so 
instead of 60 electrodes, 240 are packed 
onto the array. Imperceptibly fine 
 traces of gold form a narrow racetrack 
leading from each electrode to a silicon 
chip where the electronics package will 
eventually be mounted. 
“You can see it’s already pretty tight 
in that area,” says Satinderpall Pannu, 
a mechanical engineer in Liver more’s 
Center for Micro- and Nanotechnolo-
gies. “So you increase the density by a 
factor of four, and that’s a challenge.” 
He’s referring—through a face mask, 
since we’re both dressed in sterile gar-
ments from head to toe—to the 1024 
electrodes that an interdisciplinary 
Department of Energy team hopes to 
eventually squeeze onto the device. 
“One of the interesting scientiﬁc ques-
tions is: If you increase the density, 
how do the electric ﬁelds overlap with 
each other?” Pannu says. 
A researcher at Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory is currently mapping those 
electric ﬁelds in order to arrive at an 
effective design. Scientists elsewhere 
are developing more advanced radio-
frequency electronics and a biocom-
patible ﬁlm that could coat the device, 
reducing its size. “We all had a unique 
piece of the puzzle needed to develop 
these implants,” Pannu says. “This 
was a great vehicle to push all these 
different technologies along.” 
For its part, the team at Lawrence 
Livermore applies microfabrication 
techniques common to the semicon-
ductor industry, such as photolithogra-
phy, to manufacture the array.  Pannu 
shows me a 4-inch-diameter silicon 
wafer with 10 of the thin-ﬁlm devices, 
shaped like elegant hockey sticks, lay-
ered onto the surface. The same pro-
cess is used to manufacture inertial 
sensors, accelerometers and gyro-
scopes, which now appear in products 
from automobiles and Wii controllers 
to critical components in aircraft.
“We have somewhere between 100 
and 125 million photoreceptors in our 
eye,” Pannu says. “And so if I was los-
ing vision, I’d want to have roughly 
that same resolution after I put my 
device in. So the real question is, how 
do we go from a thousand electrodes 
to a million or 100 million?” Though 
that feat could easily be decades away, 
the researchers have already begun to 
think about how to put an integrated 
circuit directly onto the retina.
The engineering being perfected 
with the Argus device could also 
improve other neural implants. For 
example, microfabrication could make 
cochlear implants, pacemakers and 
deep-brain stimulators for treating 
Parkinson’s disease smaller and less 
invasive. The tiny, lightweight camera 
could be used in applications ranging 
from security to endoscopy. And the 
implant’s hermetic packaging could 
protect environmental sensors, espe-
cially ones used in underwater loca-
tions such as the Gulf of Mexico. 
at Christmastime, BarBara is  
able to string the lights on her tree 
unassisted—and know for herself that 
they are evenly spaced. A month later, 
she’s become very good at identifying 
the bus stop and can see the light at 
the entrance to her apartment build-
ing from up the block. By spring, she 
can distinguish the white line repre-
senting the crosswalk as she approach-
es the street, a milestone she calls 
“huge.” And a year after she received 
her artiﬁcial retina, she wears it to Dis-
neyland, where the lights ﬂy by her in 
Space Mountain. 
The 30 subjects in the clinical trial 
appreciate the Argus II for varied rea-
sons, according to Second Sight’s vice 
president of business development, 
Brian Mech. “Barbara talks about 
bumping into a lot fewer things when 
she wears it outside,” he says. “For 
other people, it’s being able to see 
their grandchildren, even if they can’t 
recognize them—being able to see the 
moon or fireworks. They feel more 
connected to their environment. They 
value things they can do with the 
device, but they value a reduction in 
isolation even more.”
A handful of other teams, in Ger-
many, Australia and elsewhere in 
America, have begun to develop reti-
nal implants as well, though currently 
none of the devices is in a U.S. clinical 
trial. In recent years, scientists have 
grown new retinal cells from stem 
cells and shown progress in develop-
ing an effective gene therapy. Each 
approach brings its own challenges. 
But someday all of them could offer a 
valid treatment for retinitis pigmen-
tosa as well as for age-related macular 
degeneration, which gradually 
destroys photoreceptors in the center 
of the retina and is the leading cause 
of blindness in adults over age 55. 
The Argus II represents a concrete 
step in that direction. I meet Barbara 
one autumn evening for a screening of 
The Wizard of Oz in Central Park. As we 
take our seats on the bleachers she 
pulls her glasses out of a black padded 
case and plugs the cord into the micro-
processor, which she slings over her 
arm. Speakers surround us, but when 
the movie starts, she turns her head to 
the left, toward the screen. “How tall 
would you say that is?” she asks. About 
40 feet, I say. “That’s what I thought!” 
To her, the structure looks like a giant 
block of white pixels that dim and 
brighten depending on whether Doro-
thy is skipping through the Haunted 
Forest or toward the Emerald City. “Oh, 
this looks so awesome!” she says.

How to Escape a  
Downed Chopper
1. open the hatches   
It takes heavy training to 
 develop the trigger-faﬆ 
responses needed to ejec air-
craf windows and open doors in 
the seconds before the chopper 
hits. “It’s the presence of mind 
to think, okay, we trained on 
this, I know what to do,“ Gayles 
says. (Moﬆ helicopter windows 
can be popped out underwater, 
but it takes much more eﬀort.) 
2. breathe deeply   
Each ﬂight-crew member carries 
a soda-bottle-size scuba tank 
in his or her ﬂight veﬆ. Te 
two-pound SEBD, or supple-
mental-egress breathing device, 
provides up to 3 minutes of air. 
And the regulator works no mat-
ter what direcion it’s placed in 
the mouth.
3. get a grip   
Gayles teaches ﬆudents to 
keep conﬆant contac with 
a reference point inside the 
aircraf, and to pull themselves 
out, hand over hand. Let go, 
and they can lose all sense of 
direcion—and any hope of 
escape. Tey’re also drilled not 
to kick, which can result in get-
ting caught up in gear or injuring 
someone else: “Get a ﬆeel-toed 
boot to the chops when you’re 
submerged and you’re likely to 
suck in water,“ he says.
4. conquer the dark   
Once Gayles’s ﬆudents can 
escape from the helo-dunker 
smoothly with their air tanks, 
they put on blacked-out 
swim goggles and repeat the 
sequence. Te ﬁnal dunk simu-
lates the moﬆ diﬃcult scenario: 
no light and no supplemental 
air. “Te training forces you to 
ﬁgure out what you need to 
be doing to get out of there,” 
Gayles says. “Juﬆ talking about 
it isn’t the same.”
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ellis Gayles is charged with keeping 
military ﬂight crews in optimal health while they’re in the 
air—or, in the worﬆ-case scenario, the water. to train aviators to 
survive a crash into the ocean, he and his ﬆaﬀ employ the 
helo-dunker, a mock helicopter pod. Students climb into the 
dunker in full ﬂight gear. Te pod is lifed above a pool. Ten it 
drops, hits the water, sinks and rolls—and the air-crew members 
pracice escaping a chaotic and deadly environment. “you may 
swim well, but put on a ﬂight suit, a survival veﬆ, a helmet and 
ﬆeel-toed boots, and it’s a whole diﬀerent ballgame,” gayles 
says. “you wouldn’t want the ﬁrﬆ time you realized it’s hard to 
move in that to be during a crash.” — KALEE THOMPSON
